1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:15,083
I am Dark Grasper,
the chief's right hand.

2
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:21,250
[TAILRED] Is that some
kind of Tail Gear?

3
00:00:21,333 --> 00:00:23,666
Not even close.
This is the ultimate armor

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:26,375
forged by the power
of glasses attribute.

5
00:00:26,458 --> 00:00:29,583
Behold the robust
beauty of Glass Gear.

6
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,500
I've come a long way for you,
my friend. Let's talk.

7
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:33,583
[TWOEARLE gasps]

8
00:00:33,666 --> 00:00:35,041
[TAILRED]
Who is this?

9
00:00:35,125 --> 00:00:37,500
And why does she
want to talk to me?

10
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:40,125
That disguise won't fool me.
As long as you're wearing

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,250
your Tail Gear, I know
exactly who you are.

12
00:00:42,333 --> 00:00:45,541
So how about you stop
playing dumb, Twoearle?

13
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,958
[TAILRED] I get it.
My Tail Gear has Twoearle's

14
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:50,625
attribute strength in it,
so she thinks I'm Twoearle!

15
00:00:50,708 --> 00:00:53,333
[TWOEARLE] Mr. Soji.
Do you read me?

16
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:55,125
I'll use the Tail Gear's
voice changing function

17
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,916
to speak for you.
So you'll have to match

18
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,208
your body to
what I'm saying.

19
00:00:58,291 --> 00:00:59,625
[TAILRED]
Roger that!

20
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:00,875
[TWOEARLE] And I think we
should try to keep things

21
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,458
as simple as possible,
so I need the two of you

22
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,291
to pretend to be passed out.

23
00:01:04,375 --> 00:01:05,708
I think we can handle that.

24
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,291
[TAILBLUE groans]

25
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:08,458
[TWOEARLE]
Here we go.

26
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:09,750
Acena?

27
00:01:09,833 --> 00:01:11,916
Oh my goodness, I can't
believe it's really you!

28
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,916
Yeah! That's right,
it's me, Acena!

29
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,250
And I want you
to know, I'm still

30
00:01:15,333 --> 00:01:17,833
your number-one superfan
even after all this time!

31
00:01:17,916 --> 00:01:19,500
You've changed quite
a bit, haven't you?

32
00:01:19,583 --> 00:01:21,041
[DARK GRASPER]
I sure have!

33
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,416
I devoted my entire life to
becoming a top-notch warrior,

34
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:24,916
so I wouldn't
embarrass myself

35
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,208
standing next to someone
as amazing as you.

36
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:29,208
[TAILRED] She really
means business.

37
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:31,083
Wait, something's different...
Your boobies?

38
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,416
What happened to those
mighty mammaries?

39
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,791
[TAILRED] They disappeared
into a distant dimension.

40
00:01:35,875 --> 00:01:37,125
No way!

41
00:01:37,208 --> 00:01:38,916
[TAILRED] Yes way, so now
I don't have much left.

42
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,875
I lost my attribute strength
fighting Ultimaguil.

43
00:01:41,958 --> 00:01:46,333
Twoearle, no!
What have you done?

44
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,916
[DARK GRASPER sobs]

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
You mean those giant,
supple love-globes

46
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:24,000
that you pressed
our young faces into

47
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,291
all those years ago are gone?

48
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,291
Are you saying that they're
never going to come back?

49
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:30,875
Like, ever?

50
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,000
[TWOEARLE] Unfortunately,
yes. The blue-haired girl

51
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,916
lying down behind me is wearing
some of my hand-me-downs.

52
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,291
[DARK GRASPER]
I thought that was a boy!

53
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:41,500
No boobs at all!
It looks like you dressed

54
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,916
a freakin' two-by-four
in some Tail Gear!

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,166
[TWOEARLE &amp; TAILRED]
By passing my Tail Gear down

56
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,458
to some poor flat-chested
excuse for a girl,

57
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:50,500
I've released myself
from the past.

58
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,833
[DARK GRASPER] You're still just
as noble and resolved as ever!

59
00:03:52,916 --> 00:03:54,125
How inspiring!

60
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,916
I'm gonna find those
legendary cuddle cushions!

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,458
Why don't we exchange emails?

62
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:01,333
That way when I find them,
I can get in touch with you!

63
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,541
[TAILRED]
What are we gonna do?

64
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:07,833
I would, but... I don't
have a phone right now.

65
00:04:07,916 --> 00:04:10,375
[TAILRED] She's not going to
buy a lame excuse like that!

66
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:11,875
[DARK GRASPER]
 Yeah, right.

67
00:04:11,958 --> 00:04:14,375
The selfie-queen I remember
always had her phone on her.

68
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,041
Wait! Fine!

69
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:18,791
I didn't wanna hafta say this,
but you've left me no choice.

70
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:21,000
I like breasts that haven't
developed yet and yours have,

71
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,583
so I don't want you anymore!

72
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:26,625
[wind whistles]

73
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:28,166
[DARK GRASPER
chuckles weakly]

74
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:31,041
I see. I didn't know
you felt that way.

75
00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,666
Maybe now is a
good time to tell you

76
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,500
that I didn't join Ultimaguil
in order to destroy humanity.

77
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,458
I have become
Dark Grasper...

78
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,875
because I wanted to
get you back, Twoearle!

79
00:04:40,958 --> 00:04:43,000
And I won't stop until I do.

80
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,625
If you need to get in touch,
I still have the same e-mail.

81
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,541
Well. Looks like
things are about

82
00:04:54,625 --> 00:04:56,708
to get a lot
more complicated.

Owowow! Ow!

84
00:04:57,958 --> 00:04:59,583
Let's see, what should
I do to you first?

85
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,041
I don't believe in torture!

86
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,125
Hey Red? Do you mind
if I stop by my house

87
00:05:04,208 --> 00:05:06,041
for a while before
we all meet up again?

88
00:05:06,125 --> 00:05:08,000
I don't want my family
to worry about me.

89
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,791
Sure thing! Just meet us at
the secret base in an hour.

[TWOEARLE screams]

92
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,333
[DARK GRASPER]
Now, my Beautiful Hearts.

93
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,625
Which one of you will go first?

94
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:33,583
[indistinct groans and mutters]

95
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,333
[SPARROW GUILDY] It has become
clear that losing Dragguildy

96
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,833
was only the beginning.

97
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:40,041
Now, Leviaguildy and Krakeguildy
have also been taken down!

98
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,791
Dark Grasper has been acting
on her own this whole time.

99
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:45,083
She hasn't let us in
on any of her plans.

100
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:48,333
Which leads me to believe that
she's trying to edge us out.

101
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,125
[ALLIGAGUILDY]
Listen up, everybody!

102
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:54,041
It's already taken two hours for
a basic analysis of Tailred!

103
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:57,000
Okay, next up is the
footage of Tailblue.

104
00:05:57,083 --> 00:05:59,375
Any objections to
fast forwarding this part?

105
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:00,833
[WALLA: ELEMELIANS] No
objections!

106
00:06:00,916 --> 00:06:02,625
[ALLIGAGUILDY]
Good!

107
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,125
[ELEMELIAN 2A] That one has some
really nice twin-tails, too.

108
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:06,458
[ELEMELIAN 2B]
Oh yes, indeed.

109
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,875
[ALLIGAGUILDY] And now
we come to the new warrior

110
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:10,875
who defeated Krakeguildy--
Tailyellow.

111
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:13,375
She'll be a serious
problem for us.

112
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:15,500
By bringing humiliation
upon herself,

113
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,750
she can increase
her latent abilities.

114
00:06:17,833 --> 00:06:21,166
We must not underestimate
this new warrior!

115
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:23,333
[HAROLD THE HERALD]
Make way, everyone!

Dark Grasper?

00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,416
[indistinct mumbling]

119
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,666
As you all know,
I am Dark Grasper.

120
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:41,750
I will be taking
charge of this unit.

121
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,666
So from now on,
you report to me.

122
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,833
[HEDGEHOG GUILDY]
How can we be certain

123
00:06:44,916 --> 00:06:46,833
this order came from the chief?

124
00:06:46,916 --> 00:06:48,250
[DARK GRASPER]
Hm?

125
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,291
[HEDGEHOG GUILDY] Your
twin-tails may be incredible.

126
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,666
But to allow a lowly human
to hold Ultimaguil's reins

127
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,625
is unorthodox
to say the least.

128
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:56,958
[DARK GRASPER] Well,
in that case... Come at me.

129
00:06:57,041 --> 00:06:59,208
[HEDGEHOG GUILDY]
Eh? Foolish girl.

130
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:03,916
You dare to challenge me?
I accept! Graaahh!

131
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:12,833
[ALLIGAGUILDY] Ahh--!
What did she do to him?

132
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,041
[SPARROW GUILDY]
You didn't see it?

133
00:07:14,125 --> 00:07:15,625
[ALLIGAGUILDY]
Huh?

134
00:07:15,708 --> 00:07:18,125
[SPARROW GUILDY] She struck him
down with her deadly sickle...

00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,125
The Darkness Glaive.

136

[ELEMELIAN 2B] Whoa! She truly
is a dark executioner!

137
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,708
I sincerely hope
that our relationship

138
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,291
can continue amicably.

You there. Alligator!

Are you some kind
of mind reader?

Come on, where is
your smartphone?

145
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:43,083
I'm just a simple-minded
barbarian warrior,

146
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:45,375
so I don't have a cell phone.
Technology is hard!

147
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:46,916
[CELLPHONE GIRL]
You have mail, Big Brother.

148
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,875
You have mail, Big Brother.
You have mail, Big Br--

149

[ALLIGAGUILDY laughs weakly]

150
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,708
This is my friend's phone,
I was just holding it for--

151
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,458
Although it's difficult not
to take this personally...

152
00:08:00,541 --> 00:08:02,416
I will go easy on you today.

153
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,500
All I ask is that when
your head stops spinning,

[MEGA NE] Poor Acena,
you have such a hard time

making friends, don't you?

162

If you want them to be
comfortable with you,

to meet them halfway.

being around girls.

So if you hand these out
instead of talking to them,

them out, you might have

[TWOEARLE] Here's what
I've gathered so far.

187
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,875
My twin-tail attribute
powers Mr. Soji's Tail Gear.

188
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:37,291
I assume she followed its
signature to this planet.

189
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,375
And that's why she
thinks Tailred is me.

190
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,791
What other information
do we have about her?

191
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,125
Well, we know that
Dark Grasper is a human.

192
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,750
So why did those
freaks accept her?

193
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:48,291
Good point. They've
made it perfectly clear

194
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:51,250
that they have no intention of
coexisting with human beings.

195
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:52,875
[ERINA] Clearly there's
some deep dark secret

196

that we haven't been
able to uncover yet!

[ERINA] All the telltale
signs are there.

199
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:59,250
A girl who used to idolize

200
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,666

Seems like a reckoning
is about to happen!

You could cut the tension
between them with a knife

203

and that only
happens when people

could imagine.

[ERINA] Don't you
think I know that?

your destiny was easy!

and watch her plan unfurl!

212

If Dark Grasper shows up again,

00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,541
she'll have to
take on all of us!

00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,083
Anko, your performance today
was absolutely amazing!

307
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,375
You're getting
better every day!

308
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:14,208
Thank you so much,
that's very sweet!

309
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:16,041
I'm glad you liked it.

310
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,416
[DARK GRASPER (ANKO)]
I started out pretending

311
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:22,041
I couldn't sing very well.

312
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:25,500
So it appears I'm improving
a little every day.

313
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,375
[DARK GRASPER] I've been
stepping it up, gradually,

314
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:29,291
just as I planned.

315
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,708
There was a time
when you truly were

316
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:35,875
a great producer,
Kerberos Guildy.

317
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,625
[DARK GRASPER] You want
me to braid my hair?

318
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,500
[KERBEROS GUILDY]
Yes! It's very important.

319
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm afraid I must insist.

320
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:45,250
The question is whether
or not braided hair

321
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,666
will have a positive
effect for Iisuna Anko.

322
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,250
[KERBEROS GUILDY] Of course
it will! How could it not?

323
00:15:50,333 --> 00:15:53,000
[DARK GRASPER] I have become the
top idol on over 20 worlds now

324
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,958
thanks in part to your
expert production skills.

325
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:58,083
However, having
braids in my hair

326
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:00,625
will interfere with my
ability to wear twin-tails.

327
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:01,625
[KERBEROS GUILDY]
O-Oh...

328
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,208
That's not gonna
work for me.

329
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:07,041
Asking me to wear braids would
go against the chief's wishes.

330
00:16:07,125 --> 00:16:09,250
[KERBEROS GUILDY] He doesn't
have to know, right? Besides,

331
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:12,458
it's not like twin-tails really
need to spread any farther?

332
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:15,041
If they do, there wouldn't be
any room left for braids.

333
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,625
Then I wouldn't have
anything to snuggle with

334
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,041
and I couldn't take that!
Do you understand?

335
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:21,000
My purpose has
always been the same.

336
00:16:21,083 --> 00:16:22,708
My ultimate goal is
to spread the gospel

337
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,375
of the twin-tails and glasses
look that I love so much.

338
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,416
I want everyone in the
universe to understand

339
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:31,083
that glasses look the
best with twin-tails.

340
00:16:31,166 --> 00:16:33,166
And of course I want to be
known as the best partner

341
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:36,875
Twoearle ever had. I won't stray
from either of these goals.

342
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:39,166
So no matter how badly
you want me in braids,

343
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:41,000
it will never happen.

344
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,291
[KERBEROS GUILDY] I would love
to keep being your producer,

345
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,708
but this was the last straw.
I've had enough.

346
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,666
I can't take it anymore!

347
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:49,833
[DARK GRASPER]
Then what should we do?

348
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,208
[KERBEROS GUILDY]
Fight it out.

349
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,333
[DARK GRASPER] I have
no desire to hurt you.

350
00:16:54,416 --> 00:16:56,250
[KERBEROS GUILDY] My apologies.
But the time has come

351
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:59,750
for me to give my
life for braids.

352
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:03,625
[DARK GRASPER] All right.
In that case, I won't hold back!

353
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:08,291
[KERBEROS GUILDY yells]

[KERBEROS GUILDY] Take proper
care of your beautiful hair!

356
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,958
[AIKA] I'm telling you,
that super-sexy attack

357
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:39,250
of the president's is going to
be a problem sooner or later.

358
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:42,291
[SOJI] Eh... Well, if the
president is okay with it,

359
00:17:42,375 --> 00:17:44,125
then I don't think it's so bad.

360
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,791
Remember, you've got to be
careful when she gets like that.

361
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,416
She seems innocent enough but
once that switch is flipped,

362
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,583
there's no telling how
mixed up things could get.

363
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,333
What're you talking about?
I don't understand.

364
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,791
Aika's just jealous because
Tailyellow is so much sexier

365
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:58,833
than she is. The one
thing Aika can do better

366
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:02,166
is fight, and lets be
honest, that's not hot.

367
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,333
[AIKA] I have no idea
what you're talking about.

368
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,791
I'm not violent. I just
enjoy the sounds you make

369
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:08,333
when I'm choking
the life out of you.

Oh. Hey, you're awake.

371

[AIKA] I could listen
to it all day.

What do you think
about that? Huh?

[ERINA]
Aika!

00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:18,833
I need you to come over
here and hit me too!

[AIKA &amp; TWOEARLE]
Huh?

376
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:21,291
You two seem to be best friends

her all the time.

a member of this group,

of that stuff as well.

Go ahead and slap me across
the face, Aika! Please!

381
00:18:29,875 --> 00:18:32,750
No. Sorry. I couldn't
possibly do that.

382
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:36,583
Well, I guess I can't
force you. All right, Soji.

383
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:38,750
Looks like you're gonna
have to hit me instead!

No way! I can't do that!

Go on. Do it!

that much to you...

[TWOEARLE] Miss Erina, can we
talk over here for a moment?

I think I can help you out.

[AIKA] Wait, what
are you guys doing?

397
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:18,708
So look, here's the deal.

398
00:19:18,791 --> 00:19:20,416
Soji is still at a stage
in his development

399
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,583
where he has a difficult time

400
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:23,333
acting naturally whenever
he's around you.

401
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:26,666
Oh, I see. What do you think
we should do about it?

402
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,083
I'm not quite sure. But there's
got to be a way we can

403
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,125
help him get more comfortable
with these situations.

404
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:32,375
Okay.

405
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,916
You're totally right.
Why don't we just

406
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,333
expose him to more women?

407
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,041
What? That's terrible!

408
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,958
It's a pleasure to meet you,

Ah. Hello, my name is Erina
Shindo. The pleasure's all mine.

It's okay, you
shouldn't worry, Aika.

411
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,833
If you think about it, this
could be your big chance.

412
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:51,375
Once he's comfortable with
women, I bet he'll notice you.

413
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,416
So, how are we
going to fix this?

414
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:55,125
Well, for Soji's sake,
we'd better introduce him

415
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:57,166
to one of these
as soon as possible.

416

[ERINA] Uh...
a porno magazine?

417
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:03,125
Oh yeah! The right kind of
magazine should help him become

418

much more comfortable when
he's dealing with normal girls.

Do you really think so?

It's a heck of plan.
I say you do it!

it. I'm going to go out there

gotta go with "yuri."

[BOY STUDENT 7B]
Nah, it's spelled the same,

437

all girl-on-girl action.

about this, Twoearle?

00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:25,291
She's doing all of this
to help the Twin-Tails?

455
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:30,250
Well, Madame President,
I'm with you!

00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,750
[EMU] Be honest with me.
Erina has been

464
00:22:00,833 --> 00:22:03,166
severely neglecting her
lessons lately, hasn't she?

465
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:04,791
No ma'am.
She studies hard.

466
00:22:04,875 --> 00:22:06,750
I know you're covering for her.

467
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,250
I have already
made my decision.

468
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,458
I will be arranging
a marriage for Erina.

The time has come!

00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,583
There's so much drama in
store for the Twin-Tails!

471
00:23:52,666 --> 00:23:55,000
Imagine Erina taking
Soji's virginity.

472
00:23:55,083 --> 00:23:56,583
[AIKA] Hold on!
You shouldn't go around

473
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,041
spreading rumors like that!

[AIKA]
No! What is it?

476
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:03,125
[MIHARU] Next time:

[SOJI] Stop lying, Mom! There's
no way the title is that long!

481

[MIHARU] A hero makes
a lie come true!
