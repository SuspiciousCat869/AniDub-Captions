Wait a second. That woman.
The one standing behind Tailred.

and the great rack!

How in the world did I
not realize it until now?

7

That was her.
That was Twoearle!

8
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:50,750
[SOJI] So, Anko is...
Dark Grasper!

9
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:26,000
It's her. But still,
it doesn't make sense.

10
00:02:26,083 --> 00:02:28,458
The only logical
explanation is that Tailred

11
00:02:28,541 --> 00:02:30,541
stole the twin-tail
attribute from Twoearle.

12

That must be it!

[DARK GRASPER (ACENA)]
She likes her.

15
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,125
She probably took her captive

16
00:02:37,208 --> 00:02:39,958
because she plans on keeping
Twoearle all to herself.

17
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,666
[MEGA NE] Yeah, that
makes perfect sense.

[DARK GRASPER (ACENA)]
You'll pay for this, Tailred.

She's putting on a show.
The Meganez Devil Paranoia Tour.

And It's clear to me that she's
trying to get us to attend.

42
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,791
I think you're right. She's
sending us a coded message

so that all of us
will go to the concert.

Oh, no! That means
if I don't go to the venue

and accept her kiss,
then not only will she steal

all the fans' attribute
strength, she'll also

47

turn them all into super
embarrassing eyeglass-Ultiroids!

48

Do you really think she
would take things that far?

49
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:13,375
[TWOEARLE] Who knows
what she's capable of?

50
00:04:13,458 --> 00:04:15,250
After all, she did poke
holes in a newspaper

51
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:16,958
as a makeshift screen
so she could spy on me

52
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,541
while following me. Then
she took my hand and tried

53
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,166
to make me fondle
her absent breasts,

54
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,500
and chased after me
so she could sneak

55
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:22,875
into my room in the
middle of the night.

56
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,583
Any way you look at it,
she's one of those people.

And I have no tolerance
for such behavior!

But that's exactly the
kind of person you are!

59
00:04:30,666 --> 00:04:33,708
We can't forget she went over to
the enemy's side to get to you.

60
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,625
So there's no telling
how far she'll take this.

Anyone who would go
to such extremes

62
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,875
is a dangerous foe,
to say the least.

in a newspaper,

fondle my breasts, did I?

I hope you like 'em,

What do you mean
they never come off?

Yes, that's right.
These glasses will be fixed

to your face forever and you'll
never be able to remove them.

Also, they're my personal
prescription, so from now on,

No more lies. My decision

that's destroying Ultimaguil!

That's only part of the story.

that girls are constantly told

238
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:42,000
they look more beautiful,
or look more grown-up,

239

what I'm saying!

they take every other attribute

they won't touch glasses

and that's all that
matters to me!

their end of the bargain.

And on the countless
worlds they've conquered,

So that's why you
became a pop star--

so you can spread the Glasses
Attribute all over the world!

00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,791
Not to steal it, like
the Elemelians do,

00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:26,041
but to foster it and
protect it from harm!

00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:29,458
But above everything else,
I have one ultimate objective.

To fill the entire

want to wear these.

for you, Twoearle.

you will clearly see

that I am your one and only
