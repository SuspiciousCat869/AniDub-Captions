2
01:00:18,708 --> 01:00:20,500
What the--?

3
01:00:20,583 --> 01:00:21,750
Am I--?

4
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:23,916
I'm glad to see you're
finally awake, Mr. Soji.

5
01:00:24,000 --> 01:00:25,958
Hey, this is my room.

6
01:00:26,041 --> 01:00:27,375
I hope this is all right.

7
01:00:27,458 --> 01:00:29,791
I took the liberty
of transporting us here.

8
01:00:29,875 --> 01:00:31,000
Where's Aika?

9
01:00:31,083 --> 01:00:32,416
She took the hint
and was kind enough

10
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:33,666
to leave us alone for a while.

11
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:35,125
--[SOJI] Huh?
--[AIKA] Tell me where they are

12
01:00:35,208 --> 01:00:36,791
--[TWOEARLE] Hm?
--[AIKA] right now!

13
01:00:36,875 --> 01:00:39,000
How dare you leave me
stranded there like that!

14
01:00:39,083 --> 01:00:40,250
Don't make me out
to be the villain.

15
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:41,958
I was trying to do you a favor.

16
01:00:42,041 --> 01:00:43,708
Since you are absolutely
and unequivocally

17
01:00:43,791 --> 01:00:45,208
not involved in this,
I was nice enough

18
01:00:45,291 --> 01:00:47,083
to leave you behind and
not trouble you anymore.

19
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:49,083
Is that what you
call nice, you jerk?

20
01:00:49,166 --> 01:00:51,000
Stop! Calm down, Aika!

21
01:00:51,083 --> 01:00:53,416
Look, I need you to
explain some things to me.

22
01:00:53,500 --> 01:00:55,125
First off who were those guys?

23
01:00:55,208 --> 01:00:58,333
And, why the heck
did I turn into a girl?

24
01:00:58,416 --> 01:00:59,833
Are you sure
you wanna know?

25
01:00:59,916 --> 01:01:01,333
Yeah, of course I am.

26
01:01:01,416 --> 01:01:02,625
Then I will answer you.

27
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:05,291
But, you must touch my heart
to know the truth!

28
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:07,666
No you don't!

29
01:02:46,416 --> 01:02:49,958
[DRAGGUILDY] Have you arrived
at a conclusion yet?

30
01:02:50,041 --> 01:02:52,833
[FOX GUILDY] Yes. We believe
that this is optimal

31
01:02:52,916 --> 01:02:54,625
for that beautiful goddess.

32
01:02:54,708 --> 01:02:57,833
[SWAN GUILDY] No. Here,
take a look at my prototype!

33
01:02:57,916 --> 01:03:01,125
[GUILDIES chatter]

34
01:03:01,208 --> 01:03:04,041
[DRAGGUILDY] You must take your
cases to Tailred directly.

35
01:03:04,125 --> 01:03:07,375
More importantly, what is
the council's determination?

36
01:03:07,458 --> 01:03:08,375
[BOTH gasp]

37
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,000
[DRAGGUILDY]
Unless I'm mistaken,

38
01:03:10,083 --> 01:03:12,541
I believe I told you
to decide which one of you

39
01:03:12,625 --> 01:03:14,625
would attack her next.

40
01:03:16,166 --> 01:03:18,583
[TWOEARLE] After they--
After Ultimaguil had already

41
01:03:18,666 --> 01:03:21,375
invaded and destroyed
many other civilizations,

42
01:03:21,458 --> 01:03:23,458
they came to this planet
in an effort to steal

43
01:03:23,541 --> 01:03:26,250
all of the attribute
strength called "elemela."

44
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:28,458
They're invading
civilizations.

45
01:03:28,541 --> 01:03:30,916
Just so I'm clear, what is
attribute strength again?

46
01:03:31,000 --> 01:03:32,416
It's quite simple,
Miss Aika.

47
01:03:32,500 --> 01:03:34,583
It's the love that
you feel in your heart.

48
01:03:34,666 --> 01:03:36,083
Oh, okay.

49
01:03:36,166 --> 01:03:37,333
For example.

50
01:03:37,416 --> 01:03:39,250
You have a great affection
for twin-tails.

51
01:03:39,333 --> 01:03:40,875
This affection has been
condensed down into

52
01:03:40,958 --> 01:03:43,791
mental energy. And it's
called "twin-tail attribute."

53
01:03:43,875 --> 01:03:45,708
To put it another way,
attribute strength is

54
01:03:45,791 --> 01:03:47,500
what a person
deeply believes.

55
01:03:47,583 --> 01:03:50,125
And these monsters, they feed
off those deep desires.

56
01:03:50,208 --> 01:03:51,916
It's the greatest
need they possess.

57
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,333
So, in other words,
it's like food or water.

58
01:03:54,416 --> 01:03:56,083
They can't survive without it?

59
01:03:56,166 --> 01:03:57,291
Hm.

60
01:03:57,375 --> 01:03:59,166
In basic terms,
yes, that's correct.

61
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,458
But it's not that simple.

62
01:04:00,541 --> 01:04:02,416
They desire the "twin-tail
attribute" the most.

63
01:04:02,500 --> 01:04:03,583
It is widely considered to be

64
01:04:03,666 --> 01:04:05,500
the strongest attribute
of them all.

65
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:08,166
So twin-tails are...
the strongest?

66
01:04:08,250 --> 01:04:09,958
What? That can't be right.

67
01:04:10,041 --> 01:04:12,083
I know it sounds ridiculous,
but it's a fact.

68
01:04:12,166 --> 01:04:14,083
It's what the
Elemelians live for.

69
01:04:14,166 --> 01:04:17,458
But Soji, trust me.
You can stand up to them!

70
01:04:17,541 --> 01:04:18,541
[SOJI gasps]

71
01:04:18,625 --> 01:04:20,291
Don't be afraid.
Tail Gear is a mighty,

72
01:04:20,375 --> 01:04:21,916
counter-Elemelian armor.

73
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,375
It's based on incredible
attribute strength.

74
01:04:24,458 --> 01:04:26,166
And as a result,
it takes a lot of

75
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:27,833
attribute strength
to control it.

76
01:04:27,916 --> 01:04:29,583
That's where you come in, Soji!

77
01:04:29,666 --> 01:04:31,125
Wait a second, are you
saying there's something

78
01:04:31,208 --> 01:04:33,916
that actually appreciates my
deep love for twin-tails?

79
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:35,291
All right, slow down.

80
01:04:35,375 --> 01:04:37,125
Aren't there better examples
of the power of love?

81
01:04:37,208 --> 01:04:39,000
I get that some people
are really into twin-tails.

82
01:04:39,083 --> 01:04:41,583
But what about friendship,
or the love of your family?

83
01:04:41,666 --> 01:04:43,208
Those types of desires
are instinctive

84
01:04:43,291 --> 01:04:45,833
to most creatures of a certain
level of common intelligence.

85
01:04:45,916 --> 01:04:47,791
They're universally
held attributes.

86
01:04:47,875 --> 01:04:49,416
This needs to be the
kind of love for something

87
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:51,583
that leaves you spellbound.
A deep obsession

88
01:04:51,666 --> 01:04:53,458
for which you would be
willing to risk your life.

89
01:04:53,541 --> 01:04:55,083
That's it!
That's the cornerstone

90
01:04:55,166 --> 01:04:56,750
of attribute strength.

91
01:04:56,833 --> 01:04:58,250
What kind of idiot
would risk their life

92
01:04:58,333 --> 01:04:59,791
over something
like twin-tails?

93
01:04:59,875 --> 01:05:02,583
This kind of idiot! So why
don't you just back off?

94
01:05:02,666 --> 01:05:04,458
So lame.

95
01:05:04,541 --> 01:05:06,541
I was not wrong to fall
for you at first sight,

96
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,208
and I am so happy I did.

97
01:05:08,291 --> 01:05:09,833
I see now that giving you
the Tail Gear was

98
01:05:09,916 --> 01:05:11,666
the best decision
that I've ever made.

99
01:05:12,958 --> 01:05:15,458
Your love of twin-tails is
the greatest love there is.

100
01:05:15,541 --> 01:05:17,458
You are the chosen one,
after all.

101
01:05:17,541 --> 01:05:21,333
Wait. Seriously?
I'm really the "chosen one"?

102
01:05:22,000 --> 01:05:24,166
[AIKA]
Uh-huh-uhhh...

103
01:05:29,208 --> 01:05:30,875
[FOX GUILDY] Look at her
petite little body.

104
01:05:30,958 --> 01:05:34,583
So small, and yet she was able
to defeat Lizard Guildy.

105
01:05:34,666 --> 01:05:37,083
We are studying this video
carefully to make certain

106
01:05:37,166 --> 01:05:39,500
we do not make the
same mistakes next time.

107
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:40,833
[DRAGGUILDY] You have
all fallen in love

108
01:05:40,916 --> 01:05:42,708
with this twin-tail
haven't you?

109
01:05:42,791 --> 01:05:45,000
Indeed, she is
a deeply mystical girl,

110
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:47,125
with an oddly
intimidating presence.

111
01:05:47,208 --> 01:05:49,583
It will not be easy
to steal from her.

112
01:05:49,666 --> 01:05:51,666
[ELEMELIAN 2A] True,
but remember, that's just

113
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:54,583
the kind of challenge that gets
a warrior's blood pumping!

114
01:05:54,666 --> 01:05:56,333
[DRAGGUILDY]
Do you have a plan?

115
01:05:56,416 --> 01:05:58,333
[ELEMELIAN 2A] Yes. In order
to restrict her movement,

116
01:05:58,416 --> 01:06:00,125
I'll dress her up like a maid.

117
01:06:00,208 --> 01:06:01,791
I want to see her
apron strings flopping

118
01:06:01,875 --> 01:06:03,166
through the air
in perfect harmony

119
01:06:03,250 --> 01:06:04,916
with those big,
beautiful twin-tails!

120
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:06,583
It will be a sight to behold!

121
01:06:06,666 --> 01:06:08,041
[ELEMELIAN 2B]
No! Even better!

122
01:06:08,125 --> 01:06:10,250
Dress her in a summer outfit
and splash her with water,

123
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,458
making her clothes cling
tight against her body.

124
01:06:12,541 --> 01:06:13,791
Once her outfit is wet,

125
01:06:13,875 --> 01:06:15,500
we'll be able to see
everything there is to see!

126
01:06:15,583 --> 01:06:17,416
Not good enough! Hear me!

127
01:06:17,500 --> 01:06:20,083
Tie her up with ropes so
the only part of her body

128
01:06:20,166 --> 01:06:22,458
that's free to move about
is her twin-tails!

129
01:06:22,541 --> 01:06:23,791
[DRAGGUILDY]
Silence!

130
01:06:23,875 --> 01:06:25,125
[ELEMELIAN 2A gulps]

131
01:06:25,208 --> 01:06:26,750
[DRAGGUILDY] It is hard
to say which of your ideas

132
01:06:26,833 --> 01:06:28,083
is the most effective.

133
01:06:28,166 --> 01:06:30,666
Therefore we will decide
who will attack her next.

134
01:06:30,750 --> 01:06:32,416
In the throws of battle!

135
01:06:35,458 --> 01:06:36,708
Not to interrupt,

136
01:06:36,791 --> 01:06:38,666
but why're you guys still
staring at each other?

137
01:06:38,750 --> 01:06:40,250
Yeah, it is
a bit strange.

138
01:06:40,333 --> 01:06:41,333
In that case mister Soji--

139
01:06:41,416 --> 01:06:42,375
[SOJI]
What are you--?

140
01:06:42,458 --> 01:06:43,958
[AIKA] Oh no
you don't, Coconuts!

141
01:06:45,958 --> 01:06:47,083
[SOJI] Will you two
stop fighting

142
01:06:47,166 --> 01:06:48,750
so I can get some
straight answers?

143
01:06:48,833 --> 01:06:51,083
I still don't understand
why I turned into a girl!

144
01:06:51,166 --> 01:06:53,500
Are you sure
you want to know?

145
01:06:53,583 --> 01:06:54,833
I am.

146
01:06:54,916 --> 01:06:56,041
Typically, becoming
a woman means

147
01:06:56,125 --> 01:06:57,708
your bud has blossomed.

148
01:06:57,791 --> 01:06:58,916
That you've achieved
the age of sexual maturity

149
01:06:59,000 --> 01:07:00,375
and have taken a man to--

150
01:07:00,458 --> 01:07:01,666
[AIKA] If you don't
give us a real answer

151
01:07:01,750 --> 01:07:04,250
I'm gonna make your elbow
bend the other way.

152
01:07:08,041 --> 01:07:10,416
The truth is, the answer
is incredibly personal.

153
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:11,666
And if I'm being
completely honest,

154
01:07:11,750 --> 01:07:13,458
it's not easy
to talk about at all.

155
01:07:13,541 --> 01:07:15,125
[SOJI, AIKA]
Hm?

156
01:07:15,208 --> 01:07:16,458
You see, the real
reason Mister Soji

157
01:07:16,541 --> 01:07:19,250
becomes a girl when
he transforms is because

158
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:22,000
I have a taste for cute
girls! Is that a crime?

159
01:07:22,083 --> 01:07:24,458
Hey, no judgment
over here!

160
01:07:24,541 --> 01:07:25,875
Don't you dare
try to tell me that

161
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:28,083
you didn't
enjoy it, Mister.

162
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,666
Besides,
in the Tailred form,

163
01:07:29,750 --> 01:07:31,333
you can draw the enemy
out into the open

164
01:07:31,416 --> 01:07:32,958
with the allure
of your twin-tails.

165
01:07:33,041 --> 01:07:35,333
It's the best strategy
to defeat them.

166
01:07:35,416 --> 01:07:36,625
[AIKA]
Uh...

167
01:07:36,708 --> 01:07:38,125
And Lizard Guildy learned
the hard way that

168
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:40,000
when it comes to doing battle,
you're not just a cute,

169
01:07:40,083 --> 01:07:41,958
little play-thing,
you're a powerful combatant,

170
01:07:42,041 --> 01:07:43,500
who is not to be
taken lightly.

171
01:07:43,583 --> 01:07:46,166
Oh. Speaking of that
creepy lizard monster,

172
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:48,708
after I beat him
I picked up this thing.

173
01:07:50,375 --> 01:07:52,750
Wow, that's so
pretty! What is it?

174
01:07:52,833 --> 01:07:54,833
That, Miss Aika,
is a crystallization of

175
01:07:54,916 --> 01:07:57,750
the ability strength that the
Lizard Guildy creep was using.

176
01:07:57,833 --> 01:08:00,208
That stone is commonly
called an "elemela orb."

177
01:08:00,291 --> 01:08:02,666
[SOJI] This might sound weird,
but the moment I picked it up,

178
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:04,541
I had the image
of a doll in my head.

179
01:08:04,625 --> 01:08:07,416
A doll? Hold on,
does that mean Lizard Guildy

180
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:08,875
was obsessed with dolls?

181
01:08:08,958 --> 01:08:11,083
That's right.
Or to be more specific,

182
01:08:11,166 --> 01:08:13,291
he's really into little
girls holding dolls.

183
01:08:13,375 --> 01:08:14,500
It's weird.

184
01:08:14,583 --> 01:08:17,541
I see. So that's why
he wanted me to do that.

185
01:08:17,625 --> 01:08:20,958
[LIZARD GUILDY] Would you do me
a small favor and hug this?

186
01:08:21,041 --> 01:08:22,666
But isn't that
a little unusual?

187
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,166
Isn't what unusual?

188
01:08:24,250 --> 01:08:26,125
[SOJI] Well, if he's into
little girls holding dolls,

189
01:08:26,208 --> 01:08:27,708
he should be stealing
the attribute strength

190
01:08:27,791 --> 01:08:29,583
of doll-lovers, right?

191
01:08:29,666 --> 01:08:30,708
But, by doing so,

192
01:08:30,791 --> 01:08:32,375
the girls wouldn't
love dolls anymore.

193
01:08:32,458 --> 01:08:34,166
Which means that, in reality,
his actions would lead to

194
01:08:34,250 --> 01:08:37,208
a perpetual cycle of
self-inflicted disappointment.

195
01:08:37,291 --> 01:08:39,791
Hm. Yes, that is correct.

196
01:08:39,875 --> 01:08:41,416
You might very well
say these Elemelians

197
01:08:41,500 --> 01:08:44,500
are paradoxical beings.
Or paradoxical pervs.

198
01:08:44,583 --> 01:08:46,500
Paradoxical, huh?

199
01:08:46,583 --> 01:08:48,166
--[SOJI] Hm.
--[AIKA] Hmm...

200
01:08:48,250 --> 01:08:50,708
[FOX GUILDY panting]

201
01:08:50,791 --> 01:08:53,458
[TURTLE GUILDY panting]

202
01:08:53,541 --> 01:08:57,375
I figured it'd come down to
the two of us, Fox Guildy.

203
01:08:57,458 --> 01:08:58,708
[FOX GUILDY]
I'll be the one standing

204
01:08:58,791 --> 01:09:01,583
when this is all over,
Turtle Guildy.

205
01:09:01,666 --> 01:09:03,583
[TURTLE GUILDY]
I wouldn't be so sure.

206
01:09:03,666 --> 01:09:05,041
[FOX GUILDY]
Let's go!

207
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:08,666
[FOX GUILDY, TURTLE GUILDY]
One, two, three!

208
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:11,416
Rock, paper, scissors!

209
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:13,041
[FOX GUILDY]
Total domination!

210
01:09:13,125 --> 01:09:16,041
[TURTLE GUILDY grunts]

211
01:09:17,875 --> 01:09:19,250
Wow.

212
01:09:20,041 --> 01:09:21,375
By the way, Twoearle,

213
01:09:21,458 --> 01:09:23,500
you haven't really told us
very much about yourself.

214
01:09:23,583 --> 01:09:24,875
Oh, you wanna know me?

215
01:09:24,958 --> 01:09:26,916
Okay then. Fine.

216
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,583
Here goes.

217
01:09:31,416 --> 01:09:33,208
[AIKA]
Hm?

218
01:09:33,291 --> 01:09:35,708
Come to bed,
and you'll know me.

219
01:09:37,625 --> 01:09:40,250
Over my dead body!

220
01:09:40,333 --> 01:09:41,625
[TWOEARLE squeals]

221
01:09:41,708 --> 01:09:42,916
He didn't mean
"know you" like that,

222
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:44,166
boobs for brains!

223
01:09:44,250 --> 01:09:45,958
Truth is, it's not
a very happy story.

224
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:48,166
I felt the least I could do
was turn it into pillow talk.

225
01:09:48,250 --> 01:09:49,416
[AIKA]
You're weird!

226
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:50,833
[SOJI]
We're fine just like this.

227
01:09:50,916 --> 01:09:52,666
Please, I'd like to hear it.

228
01:09:54,750 --> 01:09:56,291
As you wish, Mr. Soji.

229
01:09:56,375 --> 01:09:58,000
Many years ago,
my home planet was invaded

230
01:09:58,083 --> 01:09:59,833
by the Ultimaguil organization.

231
01:09:59,916 --> 01:10:03,333
They invaded your planet?
Did they destroy it too?

232
01:10:03,416 --> 01:10:07,208
[TWOEARLE] No. They only stole
our attribute strength.

233
01:10:07,291 --> 01:10:09,208
There was no looting or carnage,

234
01:10:09,291 --> 01:10:13,083
but all that remains is a
lonely world devoid of hope.

235
01:10:13,166 --> 01:10:14,625
Even though
they spared our lives,

236
01:10:14,708 --> 01:10:18,083
there's nothing as cruel or
quiet as an invasion like that.

237
01:10:18,166 --> 01:10:19,708
The pain of a world
without love

238
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:22,291
is a devastating
sight to behold.

239
01:10:23,583 --> 01:10:25,875
Uh-uh. No. That's insane.

240
01:10:25,958 --> 01:10:28,500
I'd never wear my hair like
that, not in a million years.

241
01:10:28,583 --> 01:10:29,916
But when I took out
Lizard Guildy,

242
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,541
even the student council
president went back to normal.

243
01:10:32,625 --> 01:10:34,208
If I can defeat Ultimaguil,

244
01:10:34,291 --> 01:10:36,333
then your people might go
back to normal too, right?

245
01:10:36,416 --> 01:10:37,666
I'm afraid not.

246
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:39,125
The reason the damage
was reversed is because of

247
01:10:39,208 --> 01:10:41,458
how fast you were able
to beat them yesterday.

248
01:10:41,541 --> 01:10:42,500
[SOJI gasps]

249
01:10:42,583 --> 01:10:43,875
Once the Elemelians
have taken your

250
01:10:43,958 --> 01:10:46,416
attribute strength,
unless the enemy is defeated

251
01:10:46,500 --> 01:10:48,791
within a twenty-four
hour time-frame,

252
01:10:48,875 --> 01:10:51,291
you can never go back
to the way you were.

253
01:10:51,375 --> 01:10:54,125
Twenty-four hours,
that's it?

254
01:10:54,208 --> 01:10:55,958
Yes, that's it.

255
01:10:56,041 --> 01:10:59,458
Which means, when they attack,
we have to strike fast.

256
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:01,250
All right, then.

257
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:03,250
In order to avenge your world
and to protect mine,

258
01:11:03,333 --> 01:11:04,916
I will use this awesome power!

259
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:06,958
I will do whatever is required!

260
01:11:07,041 --> 01:11:10,666
[gasps cheerfully]
Thank you very much.

261
01:11:10,750 --> 01:11:12,750
In that case, there is
one important thing

262
01:11:12,833 --> 01:11:14,666
we have to discuss first.

263
01:11:14,750 --> 01:11:16,375
[AIKA gulps]

264
01:11:16,458 --> 01:11:17,541
[TWOEARLE]
When you go into battle,

265
01:11:17,625 --> 01:11:19,000
you're going to
need some backup.

266
01:11:19,083 --> 01:11:20,375
Which is why I am
going to construct

267
01:11:20,458 --> 01:11:22,375
a super secret lair
underneath your house.

268
01:11:22,458 --> 01:11:24,041
[SOJI, AIKA]
Huh?!

269
01:11:24,125 --> 01:11:25,666
It's finally time.

270
01:11:25,750 --> 01:11:28,458
At last, the moment I've
been waiting for is here.

271
01:11:28,541 --> 01:11:31,125
But that's impossible,
in more ways than one!

272
01:11:31,208 --> 01:11:32,333
Yeah! Any way
you look at it,

273
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:33,791
it's completely absurd!

274
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:35,291
Don't worry,
I've got it covered.

275
01:11:35,375 --> 01:11:37,500
With my scientific capabilities,
I can finish the base

276
01:11:37,583 --> 01:11:39,541
before morning without
anybody knowing.

277
01:11:39,625 --> 01:11:40,708
[BOTH]
Uh-uh...

278
01:11:40,791 --> 01:11:42,041
But there's
one small issue.

279
01:11:42,125 --> 01:11:44,458
Before I do anything else,
Mr. Soji, I'll need you

280
01:11:44,541 --> 01:11:46,708
to get your mother's permission
for me to live here with you.

281
01:11:46,791 --> 01:11:47,791
[BOTH]
Huh?

282
01:11:47,875 --> 01:11:49,375
There is no way
she'll ever agree to!

283
01:11:49,458 --> 01:11:50,791
It's okay by me!

284
01:11:50,875 --> 01:11:52,458
[SOJI, AIKA]
Are you for real?

285
01:11:52,541 --> 01:11:55,291
[MIHARU] Absolutely. I heard
everything you said.

286
01:11:55,375 --> 01:11:57,333
[SOJI] Hold on a second,
you heard everything?

287
01:11:57,416 --> 01:11:58,708
When I saw that
story on the news,

288
01:11:58,791 --> 01:12:00,916
I knew that was you out there
doing good deeds.

289
01:12:01,000 --> 01:12:02,500
I'm so proud!

290
01:12:02,583 --> 01:12:05,000
[SOJI] I don't understand, how
are you so calm about all this?

291
01:12:05,083 --> 01:12:07,125
I've kept the truth
from you for too long.

292
01:12:07,208 --> 01:12:09,916
It's time that
I told you everything.

293
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:11,750
Wait, did you
know about this?

294
01:12:11,833 --> 01:12:14,208
That I would be the one
chosen to wear the tail gear?

295
01:12:14,291 --> 01:12:16,208
Oh, no,
don't be ridiculous!

296
01:12:16,291 --> 01:12:18,416
Then what are you
talking about?

297
01:12:18,500 --> 01:12:20,250
I'm talking about my dream.

298
01:12:20,333 --> 01:12:21,500
[SOJI, AIKA]
Your dream?

299
01:12:21,583 --> 01:12:23,375
When I was a young girl,
I dreamed of becoming

300
01:12:23,458 --> 01:12:25,125
a super heroine
who'd save the world.

301
01:12:25,208 --> 01:12:27,708
But instead, all I became
was your mother.

302
01:12:27,791 --> 01:12:30,083
So I passed along my
hopes and aspirations to you

303
01:12:30,166 --> 01:12:32,000
so that you could
achieve them on my behalf.

304
01:12:32,083 --> 01:12:33,416
Aww, that is so sweet!

305
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:34,625
What are you saying?

306
01:12:34,708 --> 01:12:36,375
Did you do something
to me before I was born?

307
01:12:36,458 --> 01:12:38,041
 I'm pretty sure
your father wanted to be

308
01:12:38,125 --> 01:12:40,833
a super heroine
when he was young too.

309
01:12:40,916 --> 01:12:43,416
[SOJI] I'm seriously
losing my patience.

310
01:12:43,500 --> 01:12:44,875
In that case,
I have a quick question.

311
01:12:44,958 --> 01:12:46,708
Ask me anything, Twoearle.

312
01:12:46,791 --> 01:12:47,833

but that's the kinda thing

Twoearle, you're lovely.

I'm so glad someone
like you is here.

and I would be honored
to have you as a guest.

My house is yours for anything
that you might need.

But, I don't

We don't have a spare

Hey, how about you just
sleep in Soji's room instead?

[SOJI, AIKA]
Are you serious?

You're sweet!
Thank you very much, Mom!

330

I have one condition.

01:13:18,625 --> 01:13:21,000
You have to promise you'll
make a man out of Soji.

332
01:13:21,083 --> 01:13:22,291
Consider it done!

333
01:13:22,375 --> 01:13:24,750
Come with me. Right now.

She is not to be trusted.

01:13:28,833 --> 01:13:30,125
If you let
that woman stay here,

337
01:13:30,208 --> 01:13:32,500

another planet moving in

and suddenly making things
all hot and heavy!

This is exactly what
I fantasized about!

342
01:13:40,500 --> 01:13:42,958
It won't bother me one bit if
she forces herself on Soji.

343
01:13:43,041 --> 01:13:44,791
And actually, I'll be
upset if she doesn't.

344
01:13:44,875 --> 01:13:47,416
And you have the nerve
to call yourself his mother?

345
01:13:47,500 --> 01:13:49,666
Yes, I do.
And I'm proud of it.

346
01:13:49,750 --> 01:13:52,625
I'm his mother. And the only
thing that I have ever wanted

347
01:13:52,708 --> 01:13:55,166
for my baby boy is for him
to have a girlfriend!

[gasps]

349

I hoped that
it might be you.

But I guess the sweet, little
girl he's known since childhood

never found the courage
to make her move.

[AIKA] Wait, what?
What are you talking about?

But this Twoearle--
I can tell she's the one

354
01:14:07,625 --> 01:14:09,041
when I look
into those eyes.

355
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,958
The eyes of an unprincipled
girl who's out for

356
01:14:11,041 --> 01:14:13,083
my son's virginity,
no matter what.

357
01:14:13,166 --> 01:14:15,000
Uh. You would
take that kind of risk

358
01:14:15,083 --> 01:14:16,583
with a complete stranger?

359

No. Twoearle is now a

Forgive me for
saying this to you, but--

I'm not unprincipled,
Mother, not even a little.

01:14:27,541 --> 01:14:29,375
But you were absolutely
right about my interest

01:14:29,458 --> 01:14:31,375
in attempting to
steal his virginity.

I think you've just
made my life!

Well, I'm glad to hear it.

to lock your door

sleep tonight, okay?

Okay. But why?

01:14:51,333 --> 01:14:53,125
You know why! Please!

377
01:14:53,208 --> 01:14:54,958
Just do as I say
and lock that door

stupid thing shut!

It's made of wood.

[AIKA] Be careful. There's
a lot she's still hiding.

Huh? A lot of what?

382
01:15:04,583 --> 01:15:06,458
She said that
Ultimaguil invaded her world

383
01:15:06,541 --> 01:15:08,541
and stole all of
the attribute strength.

384
01:15:08,625 --> 01:15:10,708
But how did she get her hands
on the twin-tail attribute

385
01:15:10,791 --> 01:15:12,833
that makes up the main core
of the Tail Gear?

01:18:24,583 --> 01:18:27,083
safe and sound. Because I
was saved by a hero

468
01:18:27,166 --> 01:18:28,833
of justice that
swept onto the scene

469
01:18:28,916 --> 01:18:31,416
like a gust of wind and
blew those monsters away!

470
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:32,583
[BOTH gasp]

471
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:34,666
[SOJI] Don't tell me
she knows it was me.

472
01:18:34,750 --> 01:18:37,833
Oh. Not "hero."
I meant to say "heroine."

473
01:18:37,916 --> 01:18:39,541
[BOTH sigh]

474
01:18:39,625 --> 01:18:41,625
I've had my heart
completely stolen away

475
01:18:41,708 --> 01:18:43,083
by this incredible girl.

476
01:18:43,166 --> 01:18:44,958
[STUDENTS cheering]

477
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:46,750
[ERINA] Of the many videos
that have been uploaded

478
01:18:46,833 --> 01:18:49,125
on the internet, I have selected
this one for you to see.

479
01:18:49,208 --> 01:18:51,458
Uh. Does somebody wanna
tell me what's happening?

480
01:18:51,541 --> 01:18:53,416
The Shindo Family will
support this brave girl

481
01:18:53,500 --> 01:18:55,000
with everything we have.

482
01:18:55,083 --> 01:18:58,541
And so, students and teachers.
Join with me in supporting her!

483
01:18:58,625 --> 01:19:00,250
Well! Here's to our new savior!

484
01:19:00,333 --> 01:19:03,083
[STUDENTS cheering]

485
01:19:03,166 --> 01:19:05,875
[SOJI] This is crazy.
I'm a savior?

486
01:19:05,958 --> 01:19:07,750
And a super cute,
twin-tailed heroine

487
01:19:07,833 --> 01:19:10,208
that everyone's
in love with, at that?

488
01:19:12,125 --> 01:19:14,125
[SOJI]
But I'm a boy.

489
01:19:14,958 --> 01:19:17,750
[SOJI] I'm exhausted.
I think I need a nap.

490
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,833
[AIKA] Are you going
to continue on as Tailred?

491
01:19:19,916 --> 01:19:20,916
[SOJI]
Huh?

492
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:22,125
[AIKA] When we get home,
that secret base

493
01:19:22,208 --> 01:19:23,583
should be finished, right?

494
01:19:23,666 --> 01:19:25,583
You'll need to make a decision.

495
01:19:25,666 --> 01:19:27,875
[SOJI groans]
I've got time.

496
01:19:27,958 --> 01:19:31,291
It's not like they're appearing
in the sky every five minutes.

497
01:19:33,083 --> 01:19:35,125
I wouldn't be so sure.

498
01:19:36,791 --> 01:19:38,541
[DRAGGUILDY] Attention
all peon earthlings

499
01:19:38,625 --> 01:19:40,375
who occupy this planet!

500
01:19:40,458 --> 01:19:42,791
We are the chosen
disciples of the Universe.

501
01:19:42,875 --> 01:19:45,125
We are Ultimaguil!

502
01:19:45,208 --> 01:19:48,375
We have no intention
of bringing you any harm.

503
01:19:48,458 --> 01:19:50,875
All we want is
the powerful light of love

504
01:19:50,958 --> 01:19:52,916
that shines in
each of your hearts.

505
01:19:53,000 --> 01:19:54,791
Resistance is futile!

506
01:19:54,875 --> 01:19:58,000
As long as you do not resist,
your lives will be secure.

507
01:19:58,083 --> 01:19:59,750
Allow us to take
the deep yearnings

508
01:19:59,833 --> 01:20:01,291
of your hearts freely.

509
01:20:01,375 --> 01:20:06,333
Obey! And your days of peace
and tranquility will continue!

510
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,416
[SOJI grunts]

511
01:20:09,500 --> 01:20:11,583
If I let them do this, our
lives won't be secure at all!

512
01:20:11,666 --> 01:20:13,958
If these monsters
take away our desires,

513
01:20:14,041 --> 01:20:15,916
this won't be a world
of peace and tranquility,

514
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:18,458
it'll be a world full of
apathy and boring hairstyles!

515
01:20:18,541 --> 01:20:21,000
And there's no way in hell
I'm letting that happen!

516
01:20:21,083 --> 01:20:22,458
Does that mean...?

517
01:20:24,666 --> 01:20:26,958
[TWOEARLE] Mr. Soji,
did you see that just now?

518
01:20:27,041 --> 01:20:28,208
Yeah, I sure did.

519
01:20:28,291 --> 01:20:29,583
[TWOEARLE] I'm picking up
Elemelian readings

520
01:20:29,666 --> 01:20:31,541
on the newly finished
base's radar.

521
01:20:31,625 --> 01:20:33,666
I have to stop them.
Tell me where?

522
01:20:33,750 --> 01:20:36,041
[TWOEARLE] At Kyuaru High
School, in the next town over.

523
01:20:36,125 --> 01:20:38,958
Okay, I know
exactly where that is.

524
01:20:39,041 --> 01:20:40,541
Here.

525
01:20:40,625 --> 01:20:42,291
[TWOEARLE] I almost forgot, I
thought up an activation code

526
01:20:42,375 --> 01:20:44,291
for Tail Gear, so call it out
when you're ready!

527
01:20:44,375 --> 01:20:46,166
Wait. You mean like
a transformation cry?

528
01:20:46,250 --> 01:20:49,125
[TWOEARLE] Yes. The activation
code is "Tail On"!

529
01:20:49,208 --> 01:20:51,166
[SOJI]
Mm! Mm...

530
01:20:51,250 --> 01:20:53,750
[AIKA]
Mm?

531
01:20:53,833 --> 01:20:55,250
Tail On then!

532
01:21:25,583 --> 01:21:28,375
[TAILRED] I don't understand.
Why Kyuaru High School?

533
01:21:28,458 --> 01:21:29,708
[TWOEARLE]
I can't be certain.

534
01:21:29,791 --> 01:21:31,208
According to the internet,
it's a school that uses

535
01:21:31,291 --> 01:21:34,125
old-style gym uniforms.
Pretty rare these days.

536
01:21:34,208 --> 01:21:36,708
[KYUARU GIRLS screaming]

537
01:21:36,791 --> 01:21:39,708
[TURTLE GUILDY chuckles]

538
01:21:39,791 --> 01:21:41,875
[TURTLE GUILDY] My name
is Turtle Guildy!

539
01:21:41,958 --> 01:21:44,625
Before I start looking for
twin-tail attribute strength,

540
01:21:44,708 --> 01:21:47,375
I'll take a moment to admire
your cute gym shorts.

541
01:21:47,458 --> 01:21:49,458
[TAILRED yells]

542
01:21:49,541 --> 01:21:52,000
[TURTLE GUILDY yells]

543
01:21:54,375 --> 01:21:56,500
That's one less
creepy monster!

544
01:21:56,583 --> 01:22:00,666
[KYUARU GIRLS squeal, giggle]

545
01:22:00,750 --> 01:22:04,000
No! Please! Stop!

546
01:22:04,083 --> 01:22:06,291
[SOJI] By that second day
I had become a celebrity.

547
01:22:06,375 --> 01:22:09,041
Sorry, I mean, Tailred
had become a celebrity.

548
01:22:09,125 --> 01:22:12,458
She was generating a lot of
a buzz all around the world.

549
01:22:12,541 --> 01:22:14,208
Apparently,
even NASA responded to

550
01:22:14,291 --> 01:22:16,708
the Ultimaguil organization's
declaration of war.

551
01:22:16,791 --> 01:22:19,833
I just hope this thing doesn't
become some kind of a big deal.

552
01:23:53,250 --> 01:23:54,583
[SOJI]
This Tail Gear is awesome!

553
01:23:54,666 --> 01:23:56,500
[TWOEARLE] Yes! The
full-body-enveloping,

554
01:23:56,583 --> 01:23:58,166
lightweight and flexible
metal photon mail

555
01:23:58,250 --> 01:23:59,916
is eighty times
harder than diamond

556
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,291
and still as supple as silk.

557
01:24:01,375 --> 01:24:02,958
[TWOEARLE] Its punching
power is a hundred tons,

558
01:24:03,041 --> 01:24:04,333
and its kicking power
is one fifty!

559
01:24:04,416 --> 01:24:06,208
[AIKA] What about
these Excelion Shorts?

560
01:24:06,291 --> 01:24:07,458
[TWOEARLE] Oh right,
they're shorts that

561
01:24:07,541 --> 01:24:08,666
wick away moisture quickly.

562
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:09,791
[SOJI]
But why shorts?

563
01:24:09,875 --> 01:24:11,125
[TWOEARLE] To make
a long story short:

564
01:24:11,208 --> 01:24:12,625
sometimes when a battle
gets drawn out,

565
01:24:12,708 --> 01:24:13,916
you may have to tinkle
and nobody wants to

566
01:24:14,000 --> 01:24:14,791
feel like they're wallowing--

567
01:24:14,875 --> 01:24:15,958
[SOJI]
Okay, that's enough!

568
01:24:16,041 --> 01:24:18,125
Next time: "The Azure
Surge! Tailblue"!

569
01:24:18,208 --> 01:24:19,833
[AIKA]
Tail On!
