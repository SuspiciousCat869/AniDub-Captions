After a long warrior's journey,

00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:34,375
your faithful servant,
Spider Guildy, has returned.

I must apologize for not coming
to pay my respects sooner.

[SPIDER GUILDY]
Thank you, Ma'am.

If it suits you,
I'll get right to it.

00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,500
I've been away honing
my skills in battle,

8
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,541
and I'd like to do something
to make up for my absence.

I have learned much.

10

And now I wish
to test my skills.

[SPIDER GUILDY]
No. Not against Tailred alone.

13

I want to go up against all
three Twin Tails at once.

Well.

Very ambitious.

I wish you luck
in this endeavor.

[SPIDER GUILDY]
By your will.

Before I leave I have
a question for you.

any experience with kissing?

going on with me?

All right, fine.

31
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,041
Then I guess I'll just come
right out and say it.

32
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,666
I can tell you're still thinking
about kissing Dark Grasper.

Well, actually, I'm not
thinking about anything.

No surprise there.
How could you be?

You would need
a brain for that.

[SOJI]
C'mon, it's no big deal.

37

Keep in mind I wasn't
exactly my regular self.

38
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,791
I was transformed into Tailred
when all that stuff went down.

39
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,625
So it was two girls kissing.

40
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,500
To me that isn't
such a big deal.

41

Girls kiss each other
all the time, right?

She was basically just saying
hello. That's all it was.

[AIKA]
Well, okay.

it doesn't sound so bad.

Forget about that.

I saw the most awesome
set of twin tails earlier.

What kind of twin tails?

Yeah... Fine

181
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:36,500
It's just that his last attack
really caught me off guard.

182

I'm all right, guys.
It's nothing, I swear.

Why the heck would you transform
while you're still in bed?

189
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,875
I wouldn't do something
like that. [gasping]

190
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:14,041
But it looks like
I did. So weird.

191
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:16,291
What's even weirder is that
I don't remember doing it.

Uh. How do you not
remember that?

This could be serious.

Well, get yourself together.

[car door slams]

206
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,125
[ERINA] Good morning,
Soji. How are you?

207
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:59,041
Huh. After a brief examination,
I see no major injuries.

208
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,750
I was worried after
yesterday's fight.

209
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:03,500
Is there anything
we can do for you?

210
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,791
[TWOEARLE]
Oh, relax! He's not hurt.

211
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,125
You see, I've been watching
Soji very closely.

212
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,041
His strong but supple
body still moves

213
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,666
like that of a panther
on the prowl.

214
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,541
Trust me, he's just fine.

215
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:16,500
[SOJI] You can't keep worrying
like this, Erina. I mean,

216
00:12:16,583 --> 00:12:19,375
his attack was pretty impressive
and it did throw me for a loop.

217
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:22,208
But I can take it.
I promise.

218
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,208
The Tail Gear wasn't
damaged either, right?

219
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,500
Good, I'm so relieved to
hear it. You're okay.

220
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:33,166
That puts my mind at ease. Uh?

221
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:34,208
[SOJI]
Huh?

222
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:39,125
Sorry, guys. I don't
know what's going on.

223
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:41,708
I was just thinking about it,
and now I'm wearing it.

Huh?!

Hey. It might be nice
to give it a try.

Would you like to take me
for a little stroll, Soji?

order me around.

to do this to Young Miss?

belongs to you! Give it!

doesn't belong to you, either!

one of those days.

At least I have you
here to keep me calm.

254

[AIKA] But it's not me
who keeps you calm.

You and I both know it's my
twin tails that do it for ya'.

That's true.

257
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,458
But your twin tails are
only a part of it, you know?

00:13:56,541 --> 00:13:58,708
Hey. What're you looking at?

259
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:01,708
Oh. I was just looking
at your lips.

260
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:04,458
Maybe it's the light, but they
look unusually shiny today.

[AIKA gasps]

262
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,500
[AIKA]
I got Soji's attention,

263
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:11,125
and it wasn't by acting coy and
tossing my twin tails around!

264
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,958
Today he was all
about my lips!

[CHERUBS laugh]

266

[AIKA] That idiot sure
keeps me on my toes.

267
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:23,833
But wait. What does it mean?

268
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,375
Maybe that's what did it.

269
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:27,750
She kissed him.

270
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:30,166
I bet that's what triggered
his interest in girls.

271
00:14:30,250 --> 00:14:32,708
Then again,
he noticed me.

272
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:37,208
And that means I might still
have a chance with him!

273

[SOJI sighs]

274
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:49,291
I don't know what's going
on with me this morning.

275
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:51,541
All I could think about
were Aika's lips.

276
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:55,083
Why wasn't I focused on her
twin-tails like I usually am?

277
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,583
This is not okay. I can't
imagine anything worse than

278
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,375
forgetting about twin tails.

279
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:03,000
How could this be
happening to me?

280
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:11,666
[SOJI] Maybe I got hit a little
harder than I thought yesterday.

281
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:16,958
[SPIDER GUILDY]
What do you mean

282
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,833
Flea Guildy "popped
out" on his own"?

283
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:20,583
Are you saying
he's gone rogue?

284
00:15:20,666 --> 00:15:21,833
Start talking.

285
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:24,666
[ELEMELIAN 2C]
Well, I...

286
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
[SPIDER GUILDY]
Out with it!

287
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:27,833
[ELEMELIAN 2C]
Yes, sir.

288
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,041
Yesterday, after you graciously
allowed the Twin Tails to escape

289
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,333
with their lives, an unpleasant
rumor was started.

290
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:34,458
Apparently there are some
who say you were frightened

291
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,291
of the Twin Tails and your
exit was actually a retreat.

292
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,708
[SPIDER GUILDY] Flea Guildy went
down there to clear my name?

293
00:15:39,791 --> 00:15:42,583
And is that the only reason my
apprentice took it upon himself

294
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:44,708
to face the mighty
Twin Tails alone?

295
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:45,833
[ELEMELIAN 2C]
Yes, sir!

296
00:15:45,916 --> 00:15:48,291
Well, he also said that
he wanted to see

297
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,166
Tailred's legs
with his own eyes.

298
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,916
At any cost.

299
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,833
[SPIDER GUILDY]
I see. The truth at last.

300
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,708
[MIHARU chuckles]

301
00:16:04,541 --> 00:16:06,958
Wh-What're you staring at?
Something on my face?

302
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:07,958
Did I get it?

303
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,208
[MIHARU]
I saw what happened.

304
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,708
On the way to school
this morning.

305
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,291
Soji was looking at your lips
and he got all turned on.

306
00:16:14,375 --> 00:16:16,708
At first you felt insecure
and confused.

307
00:16:16,791 --> 00:16:19,750
But then you realized
how great it is. Close?

308
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,125
[AIKA] Uh... How did you
know about all of that?

309
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,333
It didn't even happen

310
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,541
until we were right
in front of the school.

311
00:16:24,625 --> 00:16:26,166
[MIHARU] The limitless
information systems

312
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,666
of my unconscious mind had
a spontaneous entanglement.

313
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:29,708
[AIKA]
Huh?

314
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,208
Or, in other words,
I had a hunch.

315
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:34,250
I thought something might
be up, so I followed you two.

316
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,666
[MIHARU]
It's crunch time, honey,

317
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:40,833
which means you've got to close
the deal in one fell swoop.

318
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,416
Okay, here's the plan.

319
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,125
You're going to propose a
harmless little wager to Soji

320
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,833
the next time all of you go out
and do battle as the Twin Tails.

321
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:51,208
Oh! And if you win the bet, he's
gotta take you out on a date.

322
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,958
What kinda bet?

323
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:55,000
Let's see...

324

--[FLEA GUILDY groans]
--[TAILBLUE grunting]

325
00:17:01,041 --> 00:17:02,958
[FLEA GUILDY] Oh, yes!
What shapely legs!

326
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:04,541
And without any
bothersome breasts,

327
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,333
you're one perfectly straight
line from top to bottom!

328
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,583
You like that, huh?
Have some more!

329
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:11,083
Since I don't have any
'bothersome breasts',

330
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:12,583
I could go all day long!

331
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,125
I guess that Tailblue gave up
on trying to win that bet.

332
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:17,125
[TAILYELLOW]
Hm?

333
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:18,625
What do you mean, 'a wager'?

334
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,208
It's like a bet.

335
00:17:20,291 --> 00:17:22,750
I want you to let me have a go
at the next Elemelian we see.

336
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:23,916
I'll make a bet with you

337
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,875
that I can settle
everything peacefully.

338
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:28,125
So if I can get this freak
to retreat or surrender

339
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:30,875
without using violence,
then I win the bet.

340
00:17:30,958 --> 00:17:32,416
And if I do,

341
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,875
it means you have to do
something extra special for me.

342
00:17:35,958 --> 00:17:39,041
I thought she said she was
gonna try to do this peacefully.

343
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,708
Then she went berserk the second

344
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,541
he started talking about
how flat chested she is.

345
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,666
I know his thing is legs,
and in a weird sort of way,

346
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,041
the punishment fits the crime.

347
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,625
But she doesn't have
to kick him that much.

348
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:52,375
--[TAILBLUE grunting]
--[FLEA GUILDY] Thank you!

Thank you, so much for this gift
you've given me!

350
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:58,333
I always wanted to get stomped
by a girlyboy with shapely legs!

351

--Die!
--[FLEA GUILDY screams] More!

[GLEA GUILDY moans]
I'm almost there!

353
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:04,916
[TAILRED]
Uh...

354
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
She didn't even use
a finishing move.

355
00:18:07,083 --> 00:18:09,166
She beat him just
by kicking him.

356
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,291
[TAILBLUE pants]

357
00:18:16,375 --> 00:18:21,416
[SPIDER GUILDY] The Twin Tails
have defeated Flea Guildy!

358
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:25,083
It's all my fault! I confess,
the rumor that I became

359
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:27,583
frightened during our
battle and retreated is true!

360
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:31,333
[ELEMELIANS murmur]

361
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,958
[SPIDER GUILDY]
I can't deny it.

362
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,708
The Twin Tails were far more
powerful than I anticipated.

363
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,250
[SPIDER GUILDY] I won't say that
I couldn't prevail against them.

364
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:45,583
However, it will require a
great deal of preparation.

365
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:48,541
When I realized that,
I returned here.

366
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:51,333
Once Flea Guildy had
made up his mind to fight,

367
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:53,333
there was nothing I
could do to stop him.

368
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:56,041
It would have brought shame
upon him to hold him back.

369
00:18:56,125 --> 00:18:58,541
I was only thinking of honor.

370
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:03,458
That was my mistake, and it
cost a great warrior his life.

371
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,291
[SPIDER GUILDY]
Obviously, we must change

372
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:12,583
our way of thinking
to destroy them.

373
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,041
Do you like that? Huh?

374
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,291

Oh, oh, yeah.

Goodness. Now nobody
will ever want to marry her.

384
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:50,083
Well that was something. I sure
am glad she's on our side

I think we should
probably head on home.

386
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:53,625
Spend too much time with her,

387
00:19:53,708 --> 00:19:56,000
and there's a chance her violent
tendencies will rub off on you.

Wait! But I... Aw.

Uh... So Aika, listen,

about that bet you
made with me...

[AIKA]
Uh!

392
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,166
It seemed like you were
confident that you could

393
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:06,875
get that creep to
surrender peacefully.

394
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:09,666
But what you did to him could
hardly be described as peaceful.

395
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:13,875
I mean, death by stomping wasn't
really on your list of options.

'Kay. That's enough.
I know I lost the bet.

Can we please just
forget about it already?

There's no reason for you
to leave here in a huff.

399
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,791
You know, it's possible to take
the kinda passion you used

400
00:20:24,875 --> 00:20:27,041
to stomp that flea and
channel it in to love.

401
00:20:27,125 --> 00:20:29,125
That kind of energy
can be very useful.

gotten out of bed.

when I was sleeping before,

but this time I'm
just a regular girl!

What am I supposed to
do if I can't turn back?

What's the problem?

Three girls would be
a nice change of pace.

445
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,291
It would definitely make
the show more cheerful.

[SOJI] Mom! I don't want to
know about your crazy fantasies!

447
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,041
[MIHARU] We could
even change the title to,

448
00:24:06,125 --> 00:24:08,041
"Triple Twin Tails Tales".

449
00:24:08,125 --> 00:24:09,625
You gotta admit
that's pretty catchy!

450

"Red on the Ropes"

Oh, but then

get to be in the show.
