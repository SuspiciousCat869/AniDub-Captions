Wait... my twin-tails?

[TWIN-TAILS] You claim
that I have forsaken you,

but to put it another way,

231
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,958
through your actions,
you have forsaken yourself.

done nothing more

What?

239

[TWIN-TAILS] Love for twin-tails
and love for people

240
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,750
are two entirely
different things.

241
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,083
[TWIN-TAILS] After knowing
the warmth of a girl,

242
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:39,958
and the sweetness of a kiss,

243
00:12:40,041 --> 00:12:44,625
you started having deep,
unrelenting feelings of guilt.

244
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:46,375
You've become
concerned that your love

245

for twin-tails has been shaken.

00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:52,250
Yes, I worry about that...
every single day.

247
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,500
[TWIN-TAILS]
Of course.

248
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,625
And, as a result, you
sought out a connection

249
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:59,416
to a stronger set of twin-tails
than the ones you had before.

250
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,916
Twin-tails so strong

251
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,625
they would never come
undone or fade away.

252
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:07,000
And thus, the girl
Solar was born.

[SOJI] Solar is a product
of my anxieties?

254
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,416
[TWIN-TAILS]
Love has no form.

255
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:15,916
And sometimes, that can
make people feel insecure.

256
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:18,833
But, if you can accept that
fact and move beyond it,

257
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:22,041
that's where you'll
find true love.

258

Even in the form of a girl,

00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,083
your twin-tails will
never be able to shine.

a counterfeit absolute,

strength looks like at all.

true love is either!

deep passion for twin-tails,

of the world thinks!

314
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,375
Progress Barrettes! Initiate!

315
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:10,041
[TAILRED]
I've changed!

316
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:13,416
My newfound twin-tail
power has activated!

317
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,541
Now, Riser Chain, go!

318
00:16:19,458 --> 00:16:21,166
[ARACHNE GUILDY]
Two swords.

319
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:24,583
[ARACHNE GUILDY] You're all
flash and no functionality.

320
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,125
With two swords, your
movement will be inhibited!

321
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,791
Come on!

322
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,916
[TAILRED yelling]

323
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,500
[ARACHNE GUILDY grunts]

324
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:36,791
[ARACHNE GUILDY]
Impossible!

325
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:39,875
[TAILRED]
Don't you understand?

326
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:42,916
These two swords
are my twin-tails!

327
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:46,083
And, as such, they're the
source of all my strength!

328
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:48,625
[ARACHNE GUILDY]
Fine. You leave me no choice.

329
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,583
I will take the
twin-tail attribute

330
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,458
from the other two instead!

331
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:08,458
[TAILYELLOW] Blue, look. Red's
appearance has changed again.

332
00:17:08,541 --> 00:17:11,041
I call it Faller Chain!

333
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,208
[ARACHNE GUILDY] For her to
come out with two new forms

334
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:17,500
all at once, it shouldn't
be humanly possible!

335
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,083
Mr. Soji, my analysis
is complete!

336
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:22,416
Your Riser Chain and Faller
Chain are transformations

337
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,500
with an extremely
low level of stability.

338
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:27,250
You can only maintain
each one for 22 seconds.

339
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,916
Anything longer than that,
and you will overload!

340
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:33,166
I understand. Twenty-two seconds
is plenty of time!

341
00:17:37,416 --> 00:17:39,250
[ARACHNE GUILDY]
I believed no one could rival me

342
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,916
in my devotion to training.

343
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,416
But you, developing like
this on the battlefield,

344
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,041
are a warrior goddess.
The very essence of twin-tails!

345
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:49,291
You have made me a believer.

346
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,083
[TAILRED] It's because of the
support of so many others

347
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,583
that I possess the
twin-tails I have today!

348
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:01,125
My twin-tails are
the bonds we share!

349
00:18:01,208 --> 00:18:02,291
Forever!

350
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:07,125
[TAILRED]
Aura Pillar!

351
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,750
[yelling]

352
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:17,875
[TAILRED]
Rising Blazer!

353
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,166
[ARACHNE GUILDY groaning]

354
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,666
[ARACHNE GUILDY]
Nicely done.

355
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:34,041
Tailred, continue to master
your skills as far as you can.

356
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:37,416
When you get there, another
foe will be waiting for you.

357
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:41,458
But, even then,
never stop improving.

358
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,208
You are the
ultimate twin-tail!

359
00:18:54,000 --> 00:19:00,750
[ALL gasping]

360
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,750
Sure enough, Tailred's
twin-tails are awesome!

361
00:19:03,833 --> 00:19:04,875
The best!

362
00:19:07,958 --> 00:19:09,875
We did it, Blue. Good job.

363
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,458
[TAILBLUE grunts]

364
00:19:16,541 --> 00:19:18,791
Hey, welcome back,
Mister Soji!

365
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,875
Thanks. I'm glad to be back.

366
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,916
It's good to be home.

367
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,291
[TWOEARLE gasps]

368
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,791
Uhh. Hold on. Why aren't you
attacking me, Miss Aika?

369
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,000
How can I attack someone
who made a miracle happen?

370
00:19:35,083 --> 00:19:36,625
Uhh...

371
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:39,583
Soji accepted it right from
the beginning, remember?

372
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:41,500
The thing that was
most important to you.

373
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:42,708
[TWOEARLE gasps]

374
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,041
[AIKA] You did a really
good job, Twoearle.

375
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:50,708
[TWOEARLE crying]

376
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,000
Thanks!

377
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,041
[DARK GRASPER] Just like a
bride to love you and leave.

378
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:02,083
Oh well, this is
farewell for now.

379
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,916
I've received
specific instructions

380
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,583
to put down a traitor.

381
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,875
[DARK GRASPER] Once this
backstabber is dealt with,

382
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,208
I shall return.

383
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:15,875
Until then, enjoy
yourself, Tailred.

384
00:20:17,291 --> 00:20:18,208
[DARK GRASPER]
Man your stations

385
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,500
and prepare for
dimensional jump!

386
00:20:29,458 --> 00:20:32,083
[AIKA]
Good morning, everyone!

387
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,541
[MIHARU] Good morning!
Soji, Aika is here!

388
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,375
--[TWOEARLE] Just a minute!
--[gasps]

389
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:40,250
[TWOEARLE]
Ha! Morning, Miss Aika--

390
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,666
Get away from him, devil woman!

391
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:45,791
[TWOEARLE coughing]

392
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:49,208
I have a feeling today is going
to be another beautiful day.

393
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,250
If by "beautiful" you mean
"borderline psychotic,"

394
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:53,083
then I completely agree.

395
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,125
[MIHARU] Be sure to keep
your eye on the ball.

396
00:20:56,291 --> 00:20:58,208
Oh! But, if things
take a 'harem-y' turn,

397
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,125
Mom's totally okay
with that too!

398
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,791
[SOJI]
Uh. Ughh...

399
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:05,916
[AIKA]
Not to be rude or anything,

400
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,833
but why are you still here?
We defeated Ultimaguil.

401
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:11,000
They vanished into
another dimension, right?

402
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:12,083
[TWOEARLE]
Because, Miss Aika,

403
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:14,041
I still have a mission
to carry out.

404
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,583
[AIKA]
A mission?

405
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,291
[TWOEARLE] Yes. Now that my mind
has joined with Mr. Soji's,

406
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:21,000
I simply have to join
my body with him as well!

407
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,208
Wait, what?

408
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:23,166
[SOJI] What the heck,
Twoearle. Not cool!

409
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,583
[ERINA]
Good morning

410
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,125
It looks like peace has
finally returned to our world.

411
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:30,833
[SOJI] It's true. Thanks to you
and Aika being there to help me.

412
00:21:30,916 --> 00:21:33,333
[AIKA] Take it easy,
there's no need to be sappy.

413
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,958
[SOJI]
I'm not, I'm being honest.

414
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,291
With those pervs gone,
I guess we won't need these.

415
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:45,083
You guys? Even if
we don't need them,

416
00:21:45,166 --> 00:21:47,875
I think we should
always wear them.

417
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,958
If nobody minds, I would
really enjoy that.

418
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,625
I mean, after all, these
bracelets are a symbol

419
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:57,500
of our friendship and
the memories we've shared.

420
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,958
Sounds like a great plan to me.

421
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,500
[ERINA]
Yeah?

422
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:02,541
Cool!

423
00:22:04,166 --> 00:22:07,125
[SOJI] Twin Tails now,
Twin Tails forever!

424
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:08,958
[AIKA] Keep talkin' like that
and one of those weirdos

425
00:22:09,041 --> 00:22:10,000
is gonna show up again.

426
00:22:10,083 --> 00:22:11,375
[MIKOTO]
We can't have that, can we?

427
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:12,541
[TWOEARLE]
I say, who cares.

428
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:14,083
[SOJI]
Yeah. Bring 'em on!

429
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,791
We'll take those
pervs on any day!

430
00:22:15,875 --> 00:22:16,833
[ERINA]
Right!
