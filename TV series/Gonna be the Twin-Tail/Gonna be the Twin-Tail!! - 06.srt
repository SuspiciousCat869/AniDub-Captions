Crap.

I don't get it, why is
this happening to me?

I hope she pulls through.

Huh?

[ERINA]
As much as I want to be a hero.

29
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,375
The truth is, I just don't
think I have what it takes

30
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:07,375
to fight next to you and Aika
and take down Ultimaguil.

31
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:09,000
You're being too
hard on yourself.

32
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:12,083
Aika and I've been studying
martial arts since we were kids.

33
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:13,458
Just give it a
little bit of time,

34
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,791
and I promise you'll get
there eventually.

Just cause you can't use
your power right away

doesn't mean you
won't come around--

No, you're wrong!

38
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,208
Excuse me. But would
you three mind

39
00:03:23,291 --> 00:03:26,041
giving me a minute
alone with Soji, please?

40
00:03:26,125 --> 00:03:28,125
Are you sure, miss?

41
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:36,291
We have to be real. Tail Gear
only works effectively when

42
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:39,166
the person wearing it has
a deep love for twin-tails.

43
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,458
That's the deal, right?

44
00:03:40,541 --> 00:03:42,375
Yeah. After all,

45
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:45,416
It was constructed around
a core of twin-tail attribute.

46
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,375
To be honest with you,
when I first transformed.

47
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,333
I had this bad feeling,
deep in my heart,

48
00:03:50,416 --> 00:03:52,041
that I wasn't going to
be able to make it work.

49
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,291
[SOJI]
Hm.

[ERINA] There's something
you should know.

I don't like twin-tails,
and I never have.

Why would you lie like that?

That may be the most hurtful
lie I've ever heard.

I admire you, Soji.

twin-tails as much as you do.

[SOJI exhales]

59
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,125
But I'm not you. I don't
wear my hair like this

60
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:18,125
because I want to or
because I think it's cute.

61
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,416
I wear my hair in twin-tails
because my mother tells

62
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,791
me to and in my house we
always do what we're told.

63
00:04:22,875 --> 00:04:25,666
Shindo family rules are
not allowed to be broken.

64
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,375
That seems a little
overdramatic.

65
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,125
[ERINA] Soji, I've been
forced to wear my hair

66
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,583
like this for as long
as I can remember!

67
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:34,125
People always tell me it makes
me look like a little kid.

68
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,875
I do, but it's not like I have
a choice in the matter.

69
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,291
[ERINA] Even though I should've
been angry with my parents

70
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:44,166
for forcing my hand, instead, I
took my anger out on twin-tails.

71
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,375
I figured that since I had
to dress like a child,

72
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,625
I could be petulant
like one as well.

73
00:04:48,708 --> 00:04:50,333
I blamed everything
on twin-tails.

74
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,833
My unhappiness,
my suffering, all of it.

75
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,083
And I've hated them ever since.

76
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,291
Oh, wow. That's so terrible.

77
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,083
Regardless, I still do my duty.

78
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,583
I wear my hair like this,
in spite of it all.

79
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:05,041
But because I respect you,
I want you to know the truth.

00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,083
And that is, I don't
even like twin-tails.

Look. Madame president.

It doesn't matter
if you like them.

You're one of us now,

and nothing that happened in
your past will change that.

Plus. You may think that
you don't love twin-tails,

but I'm pretty sure
that's not the case.

Sorry, Soji, but it's true!

Well, let's agree to disagree.

90
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:26,916
I can tell just by looking
at your twin-tails.

take out Buffalo Guildy,

one of my strongest warriors,

94
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,583
and then Crab Guildy,
one of yours.

95
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,333
They were both easily
destroyed by the Twin Tails.

[KRAKEGUILDY] Dark Grasper
is not only the chief's

97

own personal inspector, but
his dark executioner as well.

98
00:05:45,958 --> 00:05:47,750
[KRAKEGUILDY] According
to the rumors I've heard,

99
00:05:47,833 --> 00:05:50,041
units that are incapable of
carrying out their mission

100
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:52,958
are dealt with mercilessly. And
not just the captains, either.

101
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:55,000
Their soldiers are
punished as well.

102
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,291
[LEVIAGUILDY]
Wait. You mean executed?

103
00:05:57,375 --> 00:05:59,208
If it were just me,
that would be one thing.

104
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:01,750
But the lives of my men, too?

105
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,541
[SPARROW GUILDY]
We must work together.

106
00:06:05,625 --> 00:06:07,083
[LEVIAGUILDY]
Yes.

107
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:10,500
I suppose this is no time to be
bickering about breast-size.

108
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:11,708
[KRAKEGUILDY]
Mm.

109
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,958
First, we must take
care of the Twin Tails.

110
00:06:14,041 --> 00:06:16,750
After they're properly
dispatched. Flat chests--

111
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,291
[LEVIAGUILDY]
Or giant breasts!

112
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,458
[KRAKEGUILDY] Is a matter we
can settle when the job is done.

113
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,708
[ERINA growls]
I don't understand.

114
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,541
Why are you so obsessed
with twin-tails,

115
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,708
can you at least explain
that much to me?

116
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:29,166
[SOJI]
I don't know.

117
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,458
I suppose I could ask you
the same thing about heroes.

118
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,916
[ERINA]
Heroes?

119
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,625
Well, I like them
because they're cool.

120
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:36,916
They protect innocents,
and put their lives on the line

121
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:38,958
every day to keep
the world safe!

122
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:40,791
They fight for what
they believe in.

123
00:06:40,875 --> 00:06:41,958
No matter what course they take,

124
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:44,000
heroes stay true to
who they really are!

125
00:06:44,083 --> 00:06:46,583
Can you say that
about twin-tails?

126
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,708
I think there are a lot
of wonderful things

127
00:06:48,791 --> 00:06:51,875
about twin-tails. Who knows,
maybe I'm completely nuts.

128
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,958
Maybe I'm unstable. After all,

129
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,083
what kind of lunatic would
risk his life over twin-tails?

130
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,750
It does sound a little crazy.

131
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:00,916
But all that's just
a front, isn't it, Soji?

132
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,500
You protect others, too.

133
00:07:02,583 --> 00:07:05,083
Getting to fight for twin-tails
is merely the icing on the cake!

134
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:07,375
Whoa, hold on.
You're dead wrong!

135
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,833
Defending twin-tails
isn't the icing.

136
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:11,500
Defending twin-tails
is the cake!

137
00:07:11,583 --> 00:07:13,333
You really mean that?

138
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,291
[SOJI]
Are you put off?

139
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,708
Uh. No, I...

140
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:17,291
I don't know yet.

141
00:07:17,375 --> 00:07:19,875
[SOJI] It's just like you and
your heroes, Madam President.

142
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:22,291
Other people might think
it's lame or stupid.

143
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,875
But for me?

144
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,333
Twin-tails are the most amazing
thing I've seen in this world.

145
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:30,500
And I don't care what anyone
else has to say about it.

146
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,041
Yes, I suppose you're right.

147
00:07:32,125 --> 00:07:35,125
Which is exactly why I'm gonna
stop those Elemelian jerks!

148
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:36,708
Those monsters
at Ultimaguil think

149
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:39,000
they can do whatever they want.
They think they can subjugate

150
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:42,041
entire worlds of people and
take away the things they love!

151
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:44,625
But I'm not gonna
let that happen.

152
00:07:44,708 --> 00:07:48,083
I'm gonna defend those people
by defending twin-tails.

153
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,583
Because that's the
only thing I can do.

154
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:53,208
It doesn't matter if
everyone thinks I'm crazy.

155
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:55,458
As long as I have friends who
I can share my feelings with,

156
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,000
and who are brave
enough to fight with me,

157
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,833
then I consider myself
to be a lucky guy.

158
00:08:00,916 --> 00:08:03,125
You could be one of
those friends, Erina.

159
00:08:03,208 --> 00:08:04,500
[ERINA]
Uh!

160
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:05,625
[SOJI]
Uh!

161
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,166
Sorry. I mean Madame president.

162
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,375
[ERINA panting]

163
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:11,500
[SOJI]
Oh no,

164
00:08:11,583 --> 00:08:13,250
you're hyperventilating.

165
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,666
Erina is fine. [exhales]

166
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:17,250
[SOJI]
Uh!

167
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,333
Madame president,
your twin-tails.

168
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,458
They glowed.

169
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:21,750
What are you talking about?

170
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,041
That isn't possible.

171
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:25,458
[SOJI]
I saw it with my own eyes!

172
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,083
I wanna tell you something.

173
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,583
[SOJI]
Uh?

174
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:31,458
I may not love twin-tails like
you, but I wanna be a hero

175
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,791
more than I've ever wanted
anything in my entire life.

176
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,458
So if you wanna fight
to defend twin-tails,

177
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:37,958
then I wanna fight
to become a hero!

178
00:08:38,041 --> 00:08:39,708
But, I guess it doesn't matter,

179
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:42,000
since I can't control
the Tail Gear's power.

180
00:08:42,083 --> 00:08:43,083
Uh!

181
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,375
Erina.

182
00:08:46,458 --> 00:08:47,958
[ERINA]
Uh...

183
00:08:48,041 --> 00:08:50,250
[SOJI] I've got a crazy idea,
would you go along with it?

184
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:50,708
Wait.

185
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,666
Seriously?

186
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:52,541
Okay.

187
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,875
Special training, am I right?

188
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,458
[ERINA]
Uh!

189
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:58,250
That's what I was gonna say, but
now you've spoiled all the fun.

190
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,958
What kind of special training?

191
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,500
--Erina.
--[ERINA] Mm?

192
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:03,958
If you're weak,
you just need to get stronger.

193
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,291
Once you've built
up your stamina,

194
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,125
you'll master your
Tail Gear in no time!

195
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,916
[ERINA]
Uh! All right, then.

196
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,708
I'm ready when you are!

197
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,291
[SOJI]
Yeah! That's the spirit!

198
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,500
Just be yourself.

199
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,541
And show us all exactly
who you really are.

200
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:17,291
[ERINA gasps]

201
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:21,125
Ah. So that's what
all this is about, huh?

202
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:22,666
I'm finally starting
to understand

203
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,583
how Miss Erina thinks,
and I like it.

204
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:26,291
--[alarm rings]
--[ALL] Uh?!

205
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,833
It sounds like
we've got company!

206
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,375
[SOJI]
Elemelians?

207
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,666
But what are they doing
in such a deserted place?

208
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,208
It doesn't make sense.

209
00:09:39,291 --> 00:09:42,625
Crap. And they picked
the worst possible time!

210
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,250
I guess training will
have to come later.

211
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,041
[AIKA] You go ahead.
I can handle this!

212
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,208
--[SOJI] Uh?
--[ERINA] Mm?

213
00:09:47,291 --> 00:09:48,750
Haven't you been
paying attention

214
00:09:48,833 --> 00:09:51,416
to my demolishing rate lately?
Look, don't worry about it,

215
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,666
I can take care of a couple
of dumb Elemelians.

216
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,125
[SOJI]
No way.

217
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:56,791
If Miss Aika says she can
take care of this situation,

218
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,708
then I believe her.
Now let's start "training"!

219
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:01,583
[TWOEARLE laughs]

220
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:03,375
[AIKA]
I'd better take off.

221
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,333
Whenever you're ready, Twoearle.

222
00:10:05,416 --> 00:10:06,583
[TWOEARLE]
All right, then.

223
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:09,583
Secret dimensional
transport gate, activate!

224
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:14,083
Tail On! Ha!

225
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,541
Oh, right.

226
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,208
Thanks for saving me,
Madame President.

227
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:39,541
[ERINA]
Uh?

228
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:40,958
[TAILBLUE] Since I've
been fighting as Tailblue,

229
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:43,833
I've become the laughingstock
of the entire planet.

230
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,666
Some even think that I'm
as bad as Ultimaguil.

231
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:49,083
But not you. I just
wanted to say thanks

232
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,666
for believing that
Tailblue is a real hero.

233
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,500
[ERINA]
You're welcome.

234
00:10:58,291 --> 00:10:59,208
[TWOEARLE]
All right team,

235
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:01,791
operation training
session: begin!

236
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:04,583
[TAILRED] You're able to
transform easily enough.

237
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,125
Now all you have
to do is believe

238
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:07,625
in your twin-tail attribute.

239
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:10,666
Look deep inside yourself,
I know you'll find it.

240
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:13,541
I wish that were true.
But I'm not like you, Soji.

241
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:15,750
I don't have that
kind of power in me.

242
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:17,791
[TAILRED]
You have to accept twin-tails!

243
00:11:17,875 --> 00:11:19,166
They're not your enemy!

244
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:21,000
They're an ally you
can always depend on!

245
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:21,958
[TAILYELLOW gasps]

246
00:11:22,041 --> 00:11:23,250
Nice try Mister Soji.

247
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:25,625
But talking isn't going
to get us anywhere.

248
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,625
Go grab a couple of those
big boulders over there,

249
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:28,750
and throw 'em at her face!

250
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,333
No. Please!

251
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,916
I feel pretty confident that if
you throw that boulder at me,

252
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,291
I'm going to die!

253
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:37,250
Oh, come on, Yellow, stop
acting like a big baby!

254
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,500
I'm the one who's
risking my life here!

255
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,833
I've got an entire army of
highly trained perverts

256
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,541
trying to kill me every day!

257
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:46,625
Technically, I guess
she's right about that.

258
00:11:46,708 --> 00:11:48,416
Twoearle makes a
good point, Yellow.

259
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,625
You say you want to be a
hero more than anything,

260
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:51,958
but be honest with yourself,

261
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,208
would a hero run away at
the first sign of danger?

262
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,416
Does she give up because
she's afraid of getting hurt,

263
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,833
or does she stay and fight?

264
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,208
She would fight.

265
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:01,208
[TAILRED] Then that's
exactly what you need to do!

266
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,375
Look, even I have broken down
in tears before my enemy.

267
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:06,708
But if you want to be one
of us, then it's not enough

268
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,291
to go around trying to
act like you're a hero.

269
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,000
I want you to show
me who you really are!

270
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:12,875
[TAILYELLOW gasps]

271
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,625
[TWOEARLE laughs]

272
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,708
[TAILBLUE grunts]

273
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,166
[LEVIAGUILDY]
Hm? Just the Blue one?

274
00:12:19,250 --> 00:12:21,416
Yeah, think you can handle it?

275
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,291
[LEVIAGUILDY]
Well, okay.

276
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:25,000
My name is Leviaguildy.

277
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:28,250
Besides twin-tails, I love
the big beautiful breasts

278
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:32,458
that serve as a symbol
of this world's fertility.

279
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:33,833
Uh. Hold on.

280
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,500
You're acting kind of weird.

281
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,916
[KRAKEGUILDY]
Yes, indeed.

282
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,958
Imagine, you, my mortal enemy,
being flat as a board.

283
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:43,958
What a heavenly prank this is!

284
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,041
[TAILBLUE]
Uh...

285
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:48,541
[KRAKEGUILDY] Greetings,
my name is Krakeguildy.

286
00:12:48,625 --> 00:12:51,291
I wish to offer you my sword.

287
00:12:51,375 --> 00:12:52,791
Okay. Are you sure?

288
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:54,291
That sounds pretty crazy.

289
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:56,208
[KRAKEGUILDY] You have the
flattest chest I have ever seen

290
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,875
in my life, my lovely princess!

291
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,875
--[TAILBLUE] Huh?
--[KRAKEGUILDY] However,

292
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:02,416
I have a sworn duty to fight
for the sake of my men,

293
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:06,083
and produce the fruits of
battle. I must not forsake it.

294
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,916
But, as a token
of my appreciation

295
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,458
for your baby bee stings,

296
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,708
I promise to fight you
with all that I have!

297
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,333
Listen, creep.
I'm a little confused,

298
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,666
because I can't tell if
that's a compliment or not!

299
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:20,833
Either way. I'm gonna kick your
butt from here to next week!

300
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,708
[TAILBLUE]
Aww. Man!

301
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,125
I hate tentacles!

302
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:27,416

303

[TAILRED grunting]

306
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,500
Go on, Red, throw that
boulder at her head!

307
00:13:40,583 --> 00:13:42,875
[TAILYELLOW]
Uh!

308
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,041
Just do it.

309
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,125
Huh?

310
00:13:45,208 --> 00:13:47,375
Yeah. Relax, she'll be fine.

311
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:49,416
'Kay. Here goes then.

312
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:52,000
Erina!

313
00:13:53,208 --> 00:13:54,291
[TAILYELLOW gasping]

314
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:55,666
[TAILRED]
It's time for you to show us...

315
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,000
...what you're really made of!

316
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:57,708
[TAILYELLOW]
Uh!

317
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,500
[TAILRED yelling]

318
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:03,083
[TAILYELLOW screams]

319
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:16,000
[TAILYELLOW panting]

320
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,208
[TAILRED]
Whoa. Awesome!

321
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:20,750
She did it, she really did it!

322
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,375
She used the Tail Gear
to obliterate that boulder.

323
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,750
It was freakin' amazing!

324
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:26,375
It looks like you
were right, Twoearle!

325
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:28,000
--[TWOEARLE] Erina!
--[TAILYELLOW sighs]

326
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,125
[TWOEARLE] Did you feel
what just happened there?

327
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,625
Yeah. I did.

328
00:14:31,708 --> 00:14:33,708
I'm almost embarrassed to say...

329
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,458
But I felt it!

330
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,333
Don't you see? That was
your twin-tail attribute.

331
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,041
If you choose love over fear,

332
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:42,416
then you can
accomplish anything!

333
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,750
I'm so happy right now.

334
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:45,291
And relieved!

335
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,833
Thank you so much for this.
I finally know who I really am.

336
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:50,958
I'm not afraid anymore, Soji!

337
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,916
I think I finally understand.
People have been treating

338
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,583
you like a cute little pet
because of the way you look.

339
00:14:56,666 --> 00:14:58,875
But now you've embraced the
love deep inside you, and you're

340
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,208
not afraid to show people
what's behind those twin-tails!

341
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:04,875
Uh! That's a lot like me.

342
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:08,625
Because Tailred's cute, people
don't see who I am inside.

343
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
I get it now.

344
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:12,125
She just wants people
to see who she really is.

345
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,583
So they'll know what
she's capable of!

346
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:17,208
You're exactly right.
Thanks, Soji!

347
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:19,666
I wanna show you
every part of my being!

348
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,083
Sounds good to me.

349
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:22,666
Well? What are you waiting for?

350
00:15:22,750 --> 00:15:24,833
Let me see what the
real Erina is made of!

351
00:15:24,916 --> 00:15:26,000
All right.

352
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:29,208
I'm going to show you
everything I have.

353
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:34,083
[moaning] Take a look!

354
00:15:34,166 --> 00:15:37,125
This is who I was
always meant to be!

355
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,916
[TAILRED, TWOEARLE scream]

356
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,875
Hold on, I'm not finished yet!

357
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:47,625
[TAILRED]
I'd say she pretty much

358
00:15:47,708 --> 00:15:49,250
has a handle on the Tail Gear.

359
00:15:49,333 --> 00:15:52,125
All right, good. I think
that's enough for now.

360
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:54,875
[TAILYELLOW laughing]
Look at me now, Soji!

361
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,916
Yes. This is who I really am!

362
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,333
This is who I've always been!

363
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,250
Take a look, Master!
Because it's all for you!

364
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:04,125
Wait a sec. Did she
just call me Master?

365
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,125
This is getting weird!
Put some clothes on.

366
00:16:08,791 --> 00:16:10,166
[TWOEARLE, TAILRED yelp]

367
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:13,125
Look at me! [laughs]

368
00:16:14,708 --> 00:16:15,708
[TWOEARLE, TAILRED scream]

369
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:17,375
Look at me!

370
00:16:17,458 --> 00:16:18,833
[TAILYELLOW sighs]

371
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,875
[TWOEARLE]
I knew she could do it!

372
00:16:22,958 --> 00:16:24,083
I knew from the beginning!

373
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,458
From the moment
I laid eyes on her,

374
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:27,916
I knew she was the missing
piece to the puzzle!

375
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:30,166
A well-endowed, sadistic,
violence-crazed piece

376
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,083
that could potentially
kill us all.

377
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,875
Oh, no. What have we done?

378
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:35,250
[TAILBLUE]
I don't mean to interrupt,

379
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:38,208
but I'm in big trouble!
These guys are attacking me

380
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:40,333
with tentacles,
which I absolutely hate.

381
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:42,750
And they're ridiculously strong!

382
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,416
--[TAILBLUE groaning]
--[TWOEARLE] Whoops. Sorry.

383
00:16:44,500 --> 00:16:46,250
--[TAILBLUE groaning]
--Did I forget to tell you?

384
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:49,625
Those Elemelians are both
as strong as Dragguildy!

385
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,291
[TAILBLUE]
Are you kidding me?

386
00:16:51,375 --> 00:16:53,791
How could you forget to mention
something that important?

387
00:16:53,875 --> 00:16:55,833
[TWOEARLE] Well, you were the
one acting all overconfident.

388
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,458
You said you could handle it!

389
00:16:57,541 --> 00:16:59,541
Two of them at
Dragguildy's level?

390
00:16:59,625 --> 00:17:01,958
That's way too much,
even for Aika!

391
00:17:02,041 --> 00:17:03,541
[TAILYELLOW]
Soji! Twoearle!

392
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,000
--[TAILRED] Mm?
--[TAILYELLOW pants]

393
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,125
We have to help her
and we have to do it fast.

394
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,375
Heroes don't just stand by while
their friend is in a bind.

395
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,000
Sorry for the wait, Blue!
We're here to help you--

396
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:17,208
[TAILBLUE]
You don't have anything to say

397
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,291
about large breasts now, do ya?

398
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,083
[TAILRED]
Uh...

[TAILBLUE yells]

401
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:32,166
[LEVIAGUILDY] I wish I could see
one last pair of giant breasts!

402
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,041
What was that?

403
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:37,291
She was in a tight spot
just a second ago, right?

404
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,833
[TWOEARLE]
Here, this should explain it.

405
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,333
[KRAKEGUILDY]
My flat-chested goddess.

406
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,916
I will say one last thing...

407
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Flat chests are a blessing.

408
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,583
There are many
women in this world

409
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,750
whose breasts are
tiny like yours.

410
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,041
And yet, they live strong,
noble lives, rich and plentiful.

411
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:56,125
Whatever evolutionary
route they follow.

412
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,083
On whichever world they reside.

413
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:00,166
Creatures always
survive and thrive

414
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:02,083
by shedding that
which is too large!

415
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:03,833
Just know that those
who fixate on size

416
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,125
are like primitive cavemen,

417
00:18:05,208 --> 00:18:07,458
staring aimlessly at
useless, shiny objects!

418

[TAILRED, TAILYELLOW gasp]

419
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,416
[TAILBLUE] So now you're calling
me a caveman, huh? Ha!

420
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,125
Hold on. I'm confused,
did she beat up the guy

421
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,166
who likes big boobs,
or the guy that doesn't?

422
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,666
[TWOEARLE] To be completely
honest with you,

423
00:18:19,750 --> 00:18:21,833
I have no idea what's going on.

424
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,125
[KRAKEGUILDY]
How dare you?!

425
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,750
I will make you pay
for killing my comrade!

426
00:18:25,833 --> 00:18:27,458
You're the one whose
gonna be paying!

427
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,750
[TWOEARLE gasps, sighs]

428
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,708
Blue! What's wrong?

429
00:18:32,791 --> 00:18:35,750
She's fine. She just ran
out of energy, that's all.

430
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:36,958
[TAILRED]
Uh!

431
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,500
She beat an Elemelian
with her bare hands.

432
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:40,625
Not to mention the
uncontrollable fit of rage she

433
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:43,791
was in before that. She probably
just needs a little break.

434
00:18:43,875 --> 00:18:45,583
In that case, I got this!

435
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,833
[TAILRED yelps]

436
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:48,250
[KRAKEGUILDY]
My flat-chested princess

437
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,666
is no longer capable of
fighting. Since I won't strike

438
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:53,666
a helpless opponent,
I will deal with her later.

439
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:54,958
So, Tailred.

440
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:57,708
I will avenge my
comrade by defeating you!

441

[TAILRED]
Uh?

442
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:01,500
Don't you worry, Red.
I'll take this tentacled jerk!

443
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,291
The only thing I ask
is that you watch me

444
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,750
as I engage in my
first real battle!

445
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,833
Tailred. Your presence
gives me strength.

446
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,375
Please, promise me you'll watch.

447
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,125
[TAILRED] You have my word,
my eyes will never leave you.

really are, Tailyellow!

This one's for you, Master.

[KRAKEGUILDY]
Prepare to die!

00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:20,750
You will see it all.

452
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,708
Every single inch of my being!

[TAILYELLOW grunting]

These clothes are
holding me back.

but to take 'em off!

[KRAKEGUILDY]
What is this madness?

You freely remove
your own armor,

exposing your hideously
large milk makers?

Is this a challenge to a duel?

In all of my years, I've never
seen anything like this!

I accept your challenge.

467
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,041
Meet my flat-chest sword!

468
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,958
[TAILRED]
Her armor is joining together!

469
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,291
Feast your eyes on this, creep!

470
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,375
Here it comes.

471
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,041
My Brake Release!

472
00:20:14,125 --> 00:20:17,125
Aura Pillar!

473
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,833
[KRAKEGUILDY grunts]
I can't move!

474
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,458
So this is the power
of the Aura Pillar?

475
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,083
Voltic Judgment time!

476
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:35,208
[TAILYELLOW yells]

477
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:45,416
[KRAKEGUILDY]
Long live the itty-bitty-ti--!

478
00:20:48,041 --> 00:20:49,000
[TAILRED]
Uh!

479
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,208
[TAILRED]
I was right.

480
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:56,250
She didn't really hate
twin-tails after all.

481
00:20:56,333 --> 00:21:00,666
In fact, she must love them
a lot to be that strong.

482
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,625
You see?

483
00:21:01,708 --> 00:21:04,458
I did well, Master.

484
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,708
You did. I'm so proud of you.

485
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:09,250
You're a hero.

486
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,208
Good job.

487
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,416
[TWOEARLE] They're still
not awake yet, huh?

488
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,625
They're exhausted.
Let them get some sleep.

489
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:19,958
After all, they've earned it.

490
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:21,125
--[STRANGER] Not bad, ladies.
--[TAILRED] Huh?!

491
00:21:21,208 --> 00:21:22,583
[STRANGER]
From the looks of it, the glow

492
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,833
of your twin-tail attribute
burns brighter than ever.

493
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:28,791
[TAILRED]
Who is that?

494
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,875
I'm sensing a tremendous
power from her.

495
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,958
Or maybe it's
attribute strength?

496
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,958
[STRANGER]
You don't know who I am?

497
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:36,125
Well then.

498
00:21:36,208 --> 00:21:37,166
[TAILRED]
Uh...

499
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:41,916
I am Dark Grasper,
the chief's right hand.

500
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:42,791
Wait a sec...

501
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:44,041
Is that Tail Gear?

502
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,166
[DARK GRASPER]
Oh no.

503
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,875
This is the robust
armor of Glass Gear.

504
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,666
There is no force in the entire
universe that can compete with

505
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:54,958
the power of glasses attribute,
the power of love for glasses.

506
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,583
I created it so I could
be exactly like you.

507
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:58,583
Hey, Twoearle.

508
00:21:58,666 --> 00:22:01,500
Wait, Twoearle?
What do you mean?

509
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:03,166
[DARK GRASPER]
Now I am a mighty warrior.

510
00:22:03,250 --> 00:22:06,541
And I report directly to
the chief of Ultimaguil.

511
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:10,083
I've come to this planet for one
reason and one reason alone.

512
00:22:10,166 --> 00:22:13,875
I want you to fight
alongside me, Twoearle.

513
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:50,000
[SOJI]
Erina!

514
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:51,458
Looks like you're our third!

515
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:52,833
Welcome to the team!

516
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,666
[ERINA] Thanks! But I
still have a long way to go

517
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:56,125
as a member of the Twin Tails,

518
00:23:56,208 --> 00:23:58,333
so I'll work hard and make
sure I get better everyday!

519
00:23:58,416 --> 00:24:00,291
[AIKA] Um, if it's okay,
could I borrow your Tail Gear

520
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:02,166
once in a while, you know
just for the heck of it?

521
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:03,291
When we're not
fighting, of course?

522
00:24:03,375 --> 00:24:04,583
[SOJI]
Are you still on that?

523
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,333
[AIKA] They've got to
grow eventually, right?

524
00:24:06,416 --> 00:24:08,375
But for now if I could use
the suit every now and then,

525
00:24:08,458 --> 00:24:09,625
maybe it would help
my self-esteem.

526
00:24:09,708 --> 00:24:11,250
[SOJI]
That's not gonna happen.

527
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:14,708
Next time: "A Passionate
Debut! Dark Grasper!"

528
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:16,291
[SOJI, AIKA, ERINA]
Tail On!
