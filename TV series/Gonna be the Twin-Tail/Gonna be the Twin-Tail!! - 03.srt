00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:47,583
Twoearle, what the heck
happened to you?

160
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:49,291
Oh, don't worry,
I'll be fine.

161
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,291
No matter how advanced
my science is

162
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,333
I realize now that it is
completely powerless

163
00:07:53,416 --> 00:07:55,333
against a barbarian
like Miss Aika.

164
00:07:55,416 --> 00:07:56,708
[SOJI]
Hm?

165
00:07:56,791 --> 00:07:58,666
Now. Soji.
Since you don't have to

166
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,416
go to school today,
I want you to

167
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,416
stay home and take
good care of Twoearle.

168
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,916
Thank you very much for
being so incredibly sweet!

169
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,666
If you should need me, I'll be
in bed, completely naked.

170
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:09,166
Hold on. Just a minute!

171
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,916
[beeping]

172
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:16,708
[AIKA]
Good morning, everybody!

173
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,000
Aika, why're you
standing there?

174
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,250
Go and help them!

175
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:23,166
[AIKA]
Uh... Hey!

176
00:08:23,250 --> 00:08:25,125
Oh. I almost forgot.

177
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:26,708
Please make sure
to use Elemeletion

178
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:27,958
in your Tail Gear equipment.

179
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,750
Hold on,
what's Elemeletion?

180
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,416
It's powerful
attribute strength

181
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,750
from all of the orbs that
you've collected so far.

182
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,375
Thanks a lot
for the heads up,

183
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:38,875
but I'm a true twin-tail
warrior, remember?

184
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,583
I'd prefer to fight
on twin-tail power

185
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,375
as much as possible!

186
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,500
Yes, of course.
I understand!

187
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,208
Tail On!

188
00:09:12,875 --> 00:09:15,333
[TAILRED] Huh?
Nobody's being attacked.

189
00:09:15,416 --> 00:09:18,291
[FOX GUILDY]
Ah, the infamous Tailred!

190
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,166
I am Fox Guildy.

191
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,375
At last, we meet face to face.

192
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,750
You just had to pop up
and ruin my afternoon.

193
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,458
I was hoping to get a day off.

194
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:28,708
You idiots don't know
when to quit, do ya?

195
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,125
[FOX GUILDY]
So far, you've defeated

196
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:31,916
every one of my comrades.

197
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,250
You've left me no choice
but to challenge you

198
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,166
and bring you down
once and for all.

199
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,583
[TAILRED]
Ah, get real!

200
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:40,333
I bet I can defeat
you with one shot!

201
00:09:40,416 --> 00:09:41,750
[grunts]

202
00:09:41,833 --> 00:09:43,666
[FOX GUILDY] They sway back
and forth when she moves

203
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:45,375
like pretty little ribbons.

204
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,666
It just melts my heart.

205
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,375
[TAILRED] I see.
You're a ribbon attribute!

206
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,666
[FOX GUILDY] That's right.
To think that the sword

207
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:54,875
that defeated my brawny
comrades was a product of

208
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:57,833
those beautifully delicate
ribbons of yours.

209
00:09:57,916 --> 00:10:00,208
I sense that this is fate.

210
00:10:00,291 --> 00:10:01,625
[grunts]

211
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:04,083
Gah! What is this stuff?

212
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,375
[FOX GUILDY]
How beautiful.

213
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:09,875
Ribbons look so lovely
on such a pretty young girl.

214
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,708
Now, you're going to
give yourself to me.

215
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:15,375
Ugh! Don't say things
like that! It's disgusting!

216
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:18,375
[FOX GUILDY] I will take
everything you have to offer!

217
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:19,833
[TAILRED whimpers]

218
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,208
[TAILRED]
What have you done?

219
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:29,833
[FOX GUILDY] Oh! I never
imagined it would be this good!

220
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,166
[groans]

221
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,166
What the heck
is wrong with this guy?

222
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,500
[TWOEARLE] You must not let
your guard down, Mr. Soji!

223
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,041
Oh. What's up, Twoearle?

224
00:10:37,125 --> 00:10:38,250
You should slay him now,
while you still

225
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,541
have the chance!

226
00:10:39,625 --> 00:10:43,833
[FOX GUILDY]
Now. Crystallize, my love!

227
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,541
[TAILRED] Whoa! They're
turning into twin-tails!

228
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:52,125
[TAILRED]
Wait is... Is that me?

229
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,875
[FOX GUILDY]
Ribbons are for tying.

230
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,958
And now I have my own Tailred
to do with as I please.

231
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:02,583
And there's nothing
you can do to stop me!

232
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,916
I have taken your divine
twin-tail attribute!

233
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
[FOX GUILDY] And, using my
own attribute strength,

234
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:10,583
I have bound it up
forever and ever.

235
00:11:10,666 --> 00:11:12,000
I don't understand.
Are you saying

236
00:11:12,083 --> 00:11:13,875
you copied my power?

237
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:15,833
[FOX GUILDY chuckles]
Of course not.

238
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,375
It's just a mannequin.

239
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,416
I don't have doll attribute
like my comrade Lizard Guildy,

240
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:23,541
so I lack the power to
make it move on my own.

241
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,833
But, it's still
a sight to behold,

242
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:27,958
don't you think?

243
00:11:28,041 --> 00:11:30,583
[FOX GUILDY moans]
[TAILRED scerams]

244
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,291
Hey, stop that!
You're giving me goose bumps!

245
00:11:37,458 --> 00:11:38,833
[TAILRED MANEQUIN giggles]

246
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,708
Hooray! [giggles]

247
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,333
I love bath time!

248
00:11:42,416 --> 00:11:44,083
[FOX GUILDY]
Now, now, you mustn't run.

249
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,958
I'm not done toweling
you off yet.

250
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:49,000
You're going to catch a cold
if you keep this up!

251
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,833
Mmm! Am I
losing my mind here?

252
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,541
Or is my mannequin
self showing off

253
00:11:53,625 --> 00:11:55,333
a little too much skin?

254
00:11:55,416 --> 00:11:58,041
[TAILRED MANEQUIN giggles]

255
00:11:58,125 --> 00:12:01,291
Stop touching me!

256
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:04,083
[AIKA whines]
It's so gross.

257
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,416
Come on, Soji! Hurry up

258
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:07,541
and finish that creep off,
once and for all!

259
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,416
Miss Aika is
absolutely correct!

260
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,000
Forget about
that fake Tailred!

261
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,916
Don't feel sorry for it,
smash it to pieces!

262
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,583
Yeah, you're right.
Okay! Fine.

263
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:19,708
I'll kill you with
one shot, you degenerate!

264
00:12:21,666 --> 00:12:23,041
[grunts]

265
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,875
What's the matter?
Now's your chance, Soji!

266
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,416
It's no use, I can't!

267
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:38,375
If I destroy those twin-tails,
I could never forgive myself!

268
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,750
[TAILRED]
I refuse!

269
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,000
I know it's just a doll.

270
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,541
And I know it's probably
an instrument of evil.

271
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:48,125
But regardless,
those twin-tails have done

272
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:49,791
nothing to deserve this!

273
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:52,041
Mr. Soji,
you're amazing!

274
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,416
Ugh.

275
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,375
[growls]

276
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:57,333
What are you, dense?

277
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,625
[FOX GUILDY] You really are
the genuine article.

278
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:01,041
[TAILRED]
What?

279
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,916
[FOX GUILDY] It's a mere
mannequin yet you still can't

280
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,083
bring yourself to
destroy its twin-tails.

281
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:06,958
That is indeed true love!

282
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,833
A testament to the fact
that you possess

283
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:11,208
the ultimate
twin-tail attribute.

284
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,083
Come on, think.
What am I going to do?

285
00:13:14,166 --> 00:13:16,291
[FOX GUILDY] Hm. Well,
you can party with me

286
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:17,750
if you want to.

287
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,958
[FOX GUILDY chuckles]

288
00:13:27,250 --> 00:13:29,083
[TAILRED]
What did you just do?

289
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:33,500
[groans]

290
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,125
[FOX GUILDY]
What a lovely present.

291
00:13:35,208 --> 00:13:37,750
Don't worry,
I'll be very tender.

292
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:41,375
Please. Someone help!

293
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,583
There's gotta be something
we can do to help him.

294
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:45,916
I'm not sure what you
expect me to do about it.

295
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,458
How the heck
should I know?

296
00:13:47,541 --> 00:13:50,333
Launch a missile at him!
We have to do something.

297
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:53,208
If we don't, that freak'll
take advantage of Soji!

298
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,875
Oh, that sounds
kinda fun!

299
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:55,916
Huh?

300
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,833
Kidding! I'm kidding!

301
00:13:57,916 --> 00:14:00,958
Hmm. At this point,
I have no other choice.

302
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,791
I must make
the ultimate decision.

303
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,083
Wait, what?

304
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,250
Miss Aika, I need
you to transform.

305
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,750
All right. I'll do it!

306
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,583
Uh--I can do that?

307
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:12,375
Listen. I've kept it
from you for too long.

308
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:14,166
Mr. Soji's not the
only person in this world

309
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,416
who can harness the awesome
power of the Tail Gear.

310
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:17,791
You can do it too.

311
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:20,541
[gasps]
Wait a second.

312
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:22,916
I thought you said that the
other qualified candidate

313
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,083
was a violent
and nefarious person.

314
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,166
Uh...
I'm just being honest.

315
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:28,333
[groans]

316
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:30,000
Stop kidding around!

317
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,083
[TWOEARLE] I'm sorry.
The truth is,

318
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,250
I didn't tell you
because I didn't

319
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,416
want to put you
in any more danger.

320
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:38,791
Over the last couple
of days I have put you

321
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,541
in harms way time
and time again, Miss Aika.

322
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:42,958
You're one of the few
friends I've made

323
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,416
on this planet, and I
don't want to lose you.

324
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:47,083
That's so sweet.

325
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,166
But. What's the real reason?

326
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,500
Yeah. That was a lie.

327
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,041
Truth is, I had a plan
from the very beginning.

328
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,791
I was going to tell
an elaborate story about how

329
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,000
the only way to maintain the
integrity of the Tail Gear

330
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,583
was to infuse my biological
data with Mr. Soji's.

331
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,083
I was gonna use
fake science to get him

332
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,916
to touch my naughties.

333
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
But Miss Aika, I just
realized something.

334
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,333
If I give you the Tail Gear,

335
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,958
in order to keep
my story consistent,

336
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,541
I would have no other
choice but to rub knubs

337
00:15:10,625 --> 00:15:11,916
with you as well.

338
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,000
You are one sick,
perverted chick!

339
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,625
Seriously though,
is there ever a moment

340
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:17,208
when your mind
isn't in the gutter?

341
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,875
What's wrong with
wanting a handsome young man

342
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:20,375
to service you
from time to time?

343
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,875
Do you know how
disgusting that sounds?

344
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:25,166
--[AIKA grunts]
--[TWOEARLE yells]

345
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:26,291
Please,
I'll tell you the truth,

346
00:15:26,375 --> 00:15:27,458
just stop hitting me.

347
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:30,000
This is your
last chance, understand?

348
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:32,041
The truth is,
the other Tail Gear

349
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:33,583
is built for a larger bust.

350
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,166
So from a design standpoint,
I was hoping for

351
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,541
someone with a woman's body!

352
00:15:37,625 --> 00:15:39,541
Hey! That's enough!

353
00:15:39,625 --> 00:15:41,250
If you don't stop
making stupid comments

354
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:45,083
about the size of my chest,
you're dead. You hear me?

355
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,166
I don't care
about the size!

356
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,666
I may not be suited for
a big-busted Tail Gear,

357
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,833
but it isn't worth
trading Soji's life over!

358
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,416
Miss Aika, listen.

359
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:55,708
When I said you were
a dear friend,

360
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,750
I wasn't lying, I swear.

361
00:15:57,833 --> 00:15:59,625
[AIKA]
Where's this coming from?

362
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:01,666
[TWOEARLE] Although we may
be protecting your world,

363
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,666
it's also revenge
that I'm after.

364
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,958
And while it pains me to
force Mr. Soji to fight them

365
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:09,208
when he isn't directly
involved, the truth is this:

366
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:11,416
If I send you to fight
and something happens,

367
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,583
I feel fairly certain Mr. Soji
will never forgive me for it.

368
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,833
Those perverts go after
twin-tails, right?

369
00:16:16,916 --> 00:16:18,666
That means they'll
come after me.

370
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,000
And I'll feel better
if I'm the one

371
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:22,000
out there defending myself.

372
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:25,083
I may not be passionate about
saving others like Soji,

373
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:27,166
but I can do my part.

374
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:29,291
Once you put
that bracelet on...

375
00:16:29,375 --> 00:16:31,333
...there can be
no turning back.

376
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:34,625
I'm not a child. I accept
responsibility for my actions.

377
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,208
I'll be just fine, all right?

378
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:41,833
Miss Aika,
I want you to promise me.

379
00:16:41,916 --> 00:16:43,250
No matter what.

380
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,625
No matter what.

381
00:16:44,708 --> 00:16:46,208
[TWOEARLE] You will allow me
to be the first woman

382
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:47,750
that Mr. Soji
ever touches--

383
00:16:47,833 --> 00:16:48,791
Gimme that!

384
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,208
There isn't
any time for this!

385
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,333
You have to
promise me right now.

386
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:54,833
Otherwise, I'll keep
the damned thing for myself!

387
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,875
Hold on. Judging by the way
you're looking at me,

388
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,791
it appears you're considering
slapping me in the face,

389
00:16:58,875 --> 00:17:01,166
knocking me down, and taking
the bracelet by force.

390
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:03,000
I certainly hope you're
not that type of person.

00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,166
[DRAGGUILDY]
That blue armor.

400
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:50,625
Don't tell me it's the same
twin-tail we battled before?

401
00:17:50,708 --> 00:17:52,541
[FOX GUILDY]
And who might you be?

402
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:55,000
A twin-tail warrior
who fights along side Tailred

403
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:56,916
to protect those who
can't protect themselves.

404
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,625
The name's Tailblue!

I'm here, I'm not gonna

408

let you have your way
with Tailred anymore!

You have a marvelous

pair of twin-tails,
yourself, little blue lady.

Let me give you
the most fitting ribbon

413
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,666
I can possibly muster.

[FOX GUILDY] I can't have you
underestimating my power, can I?

415
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:24,416
It will take
quite a bit of strength

416
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,750
to break through my ribbon--

than "quite a bit"!

Hm. Indeed.

You do seem to possess
a rather uncommon strength.

No, that's impossible!

How could you
destroy my creation

without so much as
a second thought?

429

00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,041
I transformed because
I decided to, okay?

472
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,500
[PRESS chatter]

473
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,250
This is awesome!

474
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:23,500
[PRESS chatter continues]

475
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:27,666
[AIKA]
What is this? Huh?

476
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,791
Somebody wanna
tell me what's goin' on?

477
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:32,583
Oh. How about we just check
the other stations instead?

478
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:33,625
[giggles]

479
00:21:33,708 --> 00:21:34,875
Yes. Yes!

480
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:36,416
Once again,
Tailred stole our hearts

481
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,208
by standing up to the bad guys.

482
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:39,750
[FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR 3A]
Indeed! Social media was

483
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:42,291
overwhelmed with postings
about how cute she was

484
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:43,791
while fighting
through her tears.

485
00:21:43,875 --> 00:21:46,541
And how she never quit,
even when things got tough.

486
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,041
[MALE NEWS ANCHOR 3A] She really
is adorable, isn't she?

487
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,958
However,
serious questions about

488
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,583
this mysterious blue
person keep piling up.

489
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,250
[MALE NEWS ANCHOR 3A] It's true
she looks a lot like Tailred.

490
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,416
But there's a chance
she's a copycat villain

491
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,250
who patterns herself
after Tailred

492
00:22:00,333 --> 00:22:02,000
and merely pretends
to be her sidekick,

493
00:22:02,083 --> 00:22:04,500
but whose true intentions
are much more insidious.

494
00:22:04,583 --> 00:22:07,750
[snarls]

495
00:22:07,833 --> 00:22:09,041
[laughs quietly]

496
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:11,125
Uh.

497
00:22:11,208 --> 00:22:13,375
--[AIKA] What the hell is this?
--[SOJI] Guys, stop!

498
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:15,958
--Why is this happening to me?
--Seriously, take it easy!

499
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:49,875
[AIKA] I may have been
in a huff earlier,

500
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,791
but attribute strength
is really amazing!

501
00:23:51,875 --> 00:23:53,250
I can even fly now!

502
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:54,750
[TWOEARLE] Endlessly gaining
new effects by loading in

503
00:23:54,833 --> 00:23:56,541
different orbs
is what Elemeletion is.

504
00:23:56,625 --> 00:23:58,875
There are all sorts of moves
you can do with this power!

505
00:23:58,958 --> 00:24:01,291
[AIKA] All right! Let's keep
going at it, Soji!

506
00:24:01,375 --> 00:24:02,666
[SOJI]
Yeah!

507
00:24:02,750 --> 00:24:03,875
[AIKA] Next time will be our
very first joint mission

508
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:05,333
as the Twin Tails, after all!

509
00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:06,708
--[SOJI] Huh?
--[TWOEARLE] That's right.

510
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,625
You two are like
"Beauty and the Beast"!

511
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,750
[AIKA] Hey! Who are you calling
"beast," you top-heavy twit?

512
00:24:11,833 --> 00:24:14,791
[SOJI] Next time:
"Ferocity. Twin Battle!"

513
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:16,916
[TWOEARLE]
Tail On...
