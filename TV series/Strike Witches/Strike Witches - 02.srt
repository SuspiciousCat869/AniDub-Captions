1
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,875
The year is 1944.

2
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,791
Humanity's battle against
the mysterious Neuroi

3
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:44,000
continued to intensify.

4
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,958
Yoshika Miyafuji
set out for Britannia

5
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:50,000
with Major Mio Sakamoto
in order to uncover

6
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,000
the mystery of her
father's disappearance.

7
00:00:53,083 --> 00:00:55,958
As their month long
voyage was nearing its end,

8
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,541
the Neuroi attacked.

9
00:00:58,625 --> 00:01:01,708
The 501st Joint Fighter
Wing, The Strike Witches,

10
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:05,875
is en route from Britannia
to try and rescue the fleet.

11
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:54,083
All ships break formation
but remain in sections

12
00:02:54,166 --> 00:02:57,500
at maximum operational
speed for evasive action.

13
00:03:02,125 --> 00:03:03,416
Dammit!

14
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,666
Why don't those bastards
hurry up and finish us off?

15
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,791
Maybe they enjoy taking us
apart piece by piece, Captain.

16
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:12,208
Prepare all fighter
squadrons for takeoff, now...

17
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:14,458
It's time to show those alien
scum that we're not going

18
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,208
to give up without
a serious fight.

19
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:17,625
Sir!

20
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:34,250
Miyafuji!

21
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:36,291
I won't have that.

22
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,833
Get that fear out of your eyes.

23
00:03:37,916 --> 00:03:40,958
You're at sea now,
young lady, at war.

24
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:42,625
Sorry...

25
00:03:42,708 --> 00:03:45,416
It's just that... the
shaking doesn't ever stop.

26
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,333
You'll get used to it.

27
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,583
Here... I need you to look
up at me for a minute.

28
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,916
Stay still.

29
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,375
It's an intercom.

30
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,250
Now you'll be able
to communicate to me

31
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,458
whenever you want with
that in your ear, kay?

32
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:08,541
'kay

33
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,416
However, you should only use it

34
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,541
when its an emergency,
is that understood?

35
00:04:13,625 --> 00:04:14,833
Yes.

36
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,458
Well I should really be getting
back up to the flight deck.

37
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,833
Major Sakamoto?

38
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,166
Um... Are you gonna
fight them... for real?

39
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,458
Of course I am...

40
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:29,125
I have a duty and
I'm going to honor it.

41
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,708
What do I...?

42
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,875
Should I just...?

43
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,625
You should stay right here.

44
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,125
Don't go outside no
matter what happens.

45
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,791
What if...?

46
00:04:40,833 --> 00:04:43,250
Are you worried something's
going to happen to me...?

47
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,375
Don't be scared.
I'll be just fine.

48
00:04:49,875 --> 00:04:52,166
Restrict 20 mil and
50 cal fire broadside

49
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,583
or abaft the beam
during takeoff.

50
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,416
All hands prepare for launch.

51
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,458
Major Sakamoto...
prepared to launch.

52
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:30,208
The Destroyer
Yukikaze's been hit.

53
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:31,250
No response!

54
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,041
Forget it...
All units take off now!

55
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,750
The Neuroi can
regenerate indefinitely

56
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:37,416
unless their core is destroyed.

57
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:41,125
All fighters draw their fire
while I search for the core.

58
00:05:41,208 --> 00:05:42,458
Distance to track, 300.

59
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:43,583
I'm on the ceiling.

60
00:05:43,666 --> 00:05:45,333
Roger!.

61
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,250
There's less defenses up here.

62
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,333
This thing's like a porcupine...

63
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,791
I can't even find an angle
to try and look for the core.

64
00:06:04,875 --> 00:06:06,916
Receiving incoming
flash traffic from Brittania.

65
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,083
"501st Joint Fighter
Wing Dispatched.

66
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,625
ETA to your position,
twenty minutes."

67
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,458
Damn! We're so close.

68
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,583
Order all ships to
continue evasive maneuvers.

69
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,625
Major Sakamoto is out there.

70
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,125
But I'm in here.

71
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,000
Major Sakamoto!

72
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:50,583
Are you okay... Major!

73
00:06:53,916 --> 00:06:55,166
What are you doing out here?

74
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:57,666
I told you to stay put,
now get back inside!

75
00:06:57,750 --> 00:07:01,125
Major Sakamoto, I'm so glad
that you haven't been shot down.

76
00:07:01,208 --> 00:07:04,208
Miyafuji, I'm ordering you
to go back inside immediately!

77
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,916
You can't do any good out here.

78
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,875
You're only going
to get in the way.

79
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,708
But I can't stand by
and do nothing.

80
00:07:10,791 --> 00:07:12,083
There is no time for this!

81
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,958
Get back in sick bay before
you get somebody killed.

82
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,416
Major Sakamoto!

83
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:18,791
Major?! Answer me!

84
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,250
She's a reckless little girl

85
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,375
but she certainly
has a lot of heart.

86
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:26,333
I better show the same.

87
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,416
The Isokaze's been hit!

88
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,375
Time to finish this.

89
00:07:53,041 --> 00:07:56,208
Wow... that's
how a witch fights.

90
00:08:07,833 --> 00:08:09,125
Found it!

91
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,125
Sakamoto!

92
00:08:29,708 --> 00:08:31,000
Hold on!

93
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,666
I'm going to help you.

94
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:43,166
Concentrate...

95
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:47,875
Breathe...

96
00:08:48,958 --> 00:08:50,500
What are you doing?
Back off.

97
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,458
Wait... I was trying to
use some healing magic.

98
00:08:53,541 --> 00:08:55,791
You trying to tell
me you're a witch?

99
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,500
Your powers are weak.

100
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,583
I can do a better
job without your magic.

101
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:00,958
Stand back.

102
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,666
No...! I have to be able
to do something to help out.

103
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:06,750
Don't be stupid.
This is a slaughter, kid.

104
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,916
There's no place for you here.

105
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,666
Get back down to sick bay.

106
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,750
I won't go!

107
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,125
There must be
something I can do.

108
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,791
Fine kid... Bandages, okay?

109
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,916
Get as many as you can
carry and bring 'em here.

110
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,583
Got it?

111
00:09:21,666 --> 00:09:23,041
Okay.

112
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:28,666
Major! We'll try to
buy you some more time.

113
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,000
But just make sure you
find that core, get me?

114
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,166
I'm counting on you.

115
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:35,166
Godspeed, lieutenants.

116
00:09:42,083 --> 00:09:44,791
Damn it! I'm hit!

117
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,458
You haven't won yet!

118
00:09:50,125 --> 00:09:53,083
All fighters are down
except for Major Sakamoto, sir.

119
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:54,250
Damn!

120
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,541
Where are our reinforcements?

121
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:58,791
Can't those Strike Witches
fly here any faster?

122
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,166
That was too close!

123
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,083
The next one will
cripple us for sure.

124
00:10:04,166 --> 00:10:07,791
She just needs to stay afloat
till the cavalry gets here.

125
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:16,208
Collision bulkhead's
secure but not for long!

126
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,666
IC switchboard's down.

127
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,000
Get a message to
the chief of the boat...

128
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,083
expansion tank is breeched!

129
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,750
Black gang's been blown!

130
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:23,916
The engine room is flooded!

131
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,666
Use the wardroom
as zero ward for now.

132
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,458
Just get those
bodies out of here!

133
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,666
This is a slaughter kid.

134
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,000
There's no place for you here.

135
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,833
You can't do any good out here.

136
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,125
You're only going
to get in the way.

137
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:42,750
I guess there's
nothing I can do...

138
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,166
The Akagi!

139
00:10:53,250 --> 00:10:55,666
Miyafuji! Miyafuji!

140
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:59,208
Come in, Miyafuji...! Miyafuji!

141
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:06,541
Miyafuji! Miyafuji!
Miyafuji...! Miyafuji!

142
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:14,000
Yoshika... Yoshika!
Yoshika! Yoshika!

143
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:16,625
Daddy...

144
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm sorry...
I can't do anything.

145
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:26,541
Yoshika... Know that you have
a great power inside of you,

146
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,958
just like your mother
and grandmother.

147
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,541
Promise me when you grow up,

148
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,208
you'll use that power
to protect everyone.

149
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,750
Daddy...

150
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,708
Direct hit to the
Destroyer Tanikaze!

151
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,166
No response.

152
00:12:11,250 --> 00:12:13,125
Well, looks like
this is finally the end...

153
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,250
Damn... Alright men...

154
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,541
Prepare to abandon ship.

155
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:19,791
All hands, prepare
to abandon ship.

156
00:12:19,875 --> 00:12:21,791
What's this?
Who gave that authorization?

157
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:24,083
Captain... there
appears to be someone

158
00:12:24,166 --> 00:12:26,541
operating the central elevator.

159
00:12:26,625 --> 00:12:28,041
What?

160
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:35,208
I have to do what I can...

161
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,250
...with whatever power I have...

162
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,708
I promised I'd protect everyone.

163
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:02,625
Who is that?

164
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:04,625
How can she
equip a Striker Unit?

165
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,666
That's the girl
Major Sakamoto brought.

166
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,416
Her name is...

167
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:10,666
Yoshika Miyafuji.

168
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,625
Miyafuji...?

169
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,750
As in Dr. Miyafuji?!

170
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:21,875
Can't be...

171
00:13:22,458 --> 00:13:24,416
Miyafuji?

172
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:30,958
Let's go!

173
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:43,000
Pull up...!
You've got to pull up now!

174
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,750
Fly! C'mon!

175
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:10,375
I'm... I'm flying...!
I can fly!!

176
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:11,750
 I can't believe it...

177
00:14:11,833 --> 00:14:14,541
It's very the first time
she's worn the Striker Unit.

178
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:18,250
Major Sakamoto!

179
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,166
Hey, where are you going?

180
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,958
I'm here to help.

181
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,958
Look out!

182
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,666
That shield is incredible!

183
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:33,333
She has more
power than I thought.

184
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,041
Interesting.

185
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,833
Glad to have you on board,
Miyafuji.

186
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,083
Major, I brought
you another gun.

187
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:43,250
I think you should keep it.

188
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,833
You want to help us, right?

189
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,916
Yes, ma'am!

190
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,208
Excellent.

191
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:52,708
Let me show you.

192
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:55,708
Its core is hidden under
the surface right there...

193
00:14:55,791 --> 00:14:59,500
You expose the core...
while I draw its fire.

194
00:14:59,583 --> 00:15:00,375
Think you can?

195
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:02,083
I'll try and do my best.

196
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,250
Okay

197
00:15:03,333 --> 00:15:05,333
Two seconds... then follow me!

198
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:28,916
Are you okay?

199
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,750
Yes...

200
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,541
I'm fine... I'm sorry ma'am.

201
00:15:31,625 --> 00:15:33,791
I... I can still fly...

202
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:37,041
Give me a second.

203
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,375
It's her first flight...
her first battle...

204
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:40,833
She's had enough.

205
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:44,625
One more time...
Please let me try!

206
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:45,875
All right then, get ready,

207
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,291
this could be our
last chance to destroy it.

208
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:49,875
Right!

209
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,958
If I do it the same
way I'll get hit again...

210
00:15:56,041 --> 00:15:57,625
I have to think.

211
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:03,375
I see.

212
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,041
I have to stay close to it.

213
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:16,000
Hold it together, Yoshika.

214
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,208
I can do this.

215
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,416
I'm going to protect everyone.

216
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,083
That's the core!

217
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:36,166
No... I can't...

218
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,333
Did I... Did I do it?

219
00:17:12,791 --> 00:17:14,333
Unbelievable...

220
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:17,958
She's had no training...
and she pulled it off.

221
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:24,708
Core destruction confirmed.

222
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,250
That makes me ten for ten.

223
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,791
Not bad, huh?

224
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:29,958
Confirmed here as well.

225
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,916
The Neuroi has been
taken out. Good job.

226
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,916
The operation is a success.

227
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:37,500
Major Sakamoto!
Are you all right?

228
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,333
Perrine always turns into
such a complete suck-up

229
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:44,166
to the Major after
every battle's over.

230
00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,958
I'm going to make sure
to tease her... later on.

231
00:17:58,583 --> 00:17:59,750
I don't believe it!

232
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,666
Who is that and why is
she touching the Major?!

233
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:08,833
Did I...?

234
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,250
Good to have you back.

235
00:18:11,333 --> 00:18:12,625
Major Sakamoto.

236
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,000
I'm proud of you.

237
00:18:14,083 --> 00:18:15,500
I don't know how much
longer I could have survived

238
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:18,041
if you hadn't shown
up when you did.

239
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,250
But I was supposed
to destroy the core

240
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,208
and in the end all I did
was shoot around it, right?

241
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:26,125
What are you talking
about, Miyafuji?

242
00:18:26,208 --> 00:18:29,250
This was only your
first battle, you did great.

243
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,458
Come on... Take a look.

244
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:55,583
Daddy... I did it... I...

245
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:26,250
Are you sure this
is the address?

246
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:31,291
Yes. Until five years ago,
this was Dr. Miyafuji's

247
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,083
development lab
for the Striker Unit...

248
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:36,750
...up until the day
of the accident.

249
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:47,041
Major... Did you
know all this before?

250
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:53,875
I'm sorry.

251
00:19:54,291 --> 00:19:56,083
You don't have
anything to be sorry for.

252
00:19:56,166 --> 00:19:58,333
I'm so grateful that you
brought me all the way here

253
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:02,125
even though I acted so selfishly
from the moment I met you.

254
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:11,291
I used to live here
with him a long time ago.

255
00:20:12,416 --> 00:20:16,666
That letter was probably sent
back then and just got lost.

256
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,083
My dad really
has terrible timing...

257
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:25,041
He left on my
first day of school...

258
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,958
I found out he died
on my tenth birthday...

259
00:20:29,375 --> 00:20:30,958
Suddenly, this letter arrives

260
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:34,208
and for a second
I thought maybe...

261
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:39,291
I can see we're supposed
to be father and daughter,

262
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,125
but, I just don't know him.

263
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,666
"Use your power
to protect everyone."

264
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,041
That was one of his
favorite phrases he'd say.

265
00:20:53,125 --> 00:20:55,000
It's why he made the Striker.

266
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,791
He just wanted
to protect everyone.

267
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:00,833
Daddy.

268
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,875
Shall we get going?

269
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:41,583
Yes...

270
00:21:43,458 --> 00:21:45,125
Ummm?

271
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,791
Major Sakamoto.

272
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:52,500
If its still okay I'd like
to join the Strike Witches.

273
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:54,916
You sure?

274
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,333
I want to stay here and
continue my Father's work.

275
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:02,166
I want to use my power
to protect everyone I can.

276
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,333
Miyafuji.

277
00:22:04,416 --> 00:22:08,458
I'm sure it's what my father
would have wanted me to do.

278
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:10,458
I see...

279
00:22:12,625 --> 00:22:13,791
All right, then!

280
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,291
You better get ready.

281
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:18,541
I'm going to push you until
you turn into real witch,

282
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:20,083
a true witch!

283
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,416
Are you ready?

284
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,541
Yes.

285
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:42,166
As of today, the 501st Joint
Fighter Wing has a new member.

286
00:22:43,166 --> 00:22:45,000
Yoshika Miyafuji.

287
00:22:45,083 --> 00:22:47,416
I'm Yoshika Miyafuji!

288
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,666
I'm happy to meet you.

289
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:25,916
So we have a new recruit.

290
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,708
I wonder what she's like...

291
00:24:27,791 --> 00:24:29,666
I wonder if she's really good...

292
00:24:29,750 --> 00:24:31,416
She could be better than me...

293
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:33,583
What if she is?

294
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,833
Next time on Strike Witches:
"You're Not Alone."
