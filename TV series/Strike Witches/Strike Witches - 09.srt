1
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:36,916
Impressive...

2
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,333
You've created quite
a dramatic scene here.

3
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:42,833
Promise me...

4
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,625
Say you won't wear
a striker again.

5
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,416
Is that an order, Commander?

6
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:53,833
The reason I ask is
that it's hard for me

7
00:00:53,916 --> 00:00:56,208
to take you seriously when
you're wearing that outfit.

8
00:00:56,291 --> 00:00:57,916
Oh, I'm very serious...

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,916
If you go into battle again...

10
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,500
You'll die... You're not
strong enough Mio...

11
00:01:02,583 --> 00:01:05,916
So you've decided to
kill me yourself instead...

12
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,708
Is that what's going on...?

13
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:11,458
Very paradoxical...
and not like you at all.

14
00:01:11,541 --> 00:01:14,041
You're right, it's not!

15
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,333
I'm sorry... but I'm
still going into battle.

16
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,583
STOP!

17
00:03:39,125 --> 00:03:40,541
Oh come on...!

18
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:43,375
Just for today.
But that's it okay!

19
00:03:49,708 --> 00:03:50,750
Got a minute?

20
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,125
Uh, what's in here?

21
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:53,166
I'm sorry...

22
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,541
Should I get someone else?

23
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,541
No, really it's not that heavy.

24
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:57,666
Some data for you.

25
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,583
Regarding the recent Neuroi.

26
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,125
Specifically, the singing
Neuroi that Sanya intercepted

27
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:06,708
on two occasions...

28
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,250
Each time it appeared,

29
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:11,916
various monitoring stations
picked up an unusual frequency.

30
00:04:12,916 --> 00:04:15,083
While the frequency is
unusual, the wave form

31
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:19,333
is very familiar... it's
the same as Sanya's.

32
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:20,416
Oh.

33
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,458
The song?

34
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:25,958
The Neuroi was mimicking Sanya.

35
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:27,708
Her actions and her voice.

36
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:28,833
I see.

37
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:31,000
We need to rethink
our whole analysis.

38
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:33,833
This should be
our top priority.

39
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:35,166
I think you're right.

40
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:37,458
I'd like to inform Hartmann
and Barkhorn of this

41
00:04:37,541 --> 00:04:40,958
and get them working on it
together... as soon as possible.

42
00:04:41,041 --> 00:04:42,416
Um... sorry.

43
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:44,666
Just thought you should
know Barkhorn's not here...

44
00:04:44,750 --> 00:04:46,583
She and Hartmann
left earlier today.

45
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,083
Where'd they go?

46
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,291
London.

47
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:50,500
London?

48
00:04:50,583 --> 00:04:52,458
Yeah, apparently
her sister woke up.

49
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,166
She's not in a coma anymore!

50
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,750
She was so happy...

51
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,625
When she heard the news,
she immediately put on

52
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,708
her Striker to fly there, but
the others talked her out of it.

53
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:01,583
It was really weird.

54
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,625
She's usually so calm.

55
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,750
Well that makes sense...

56
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,916
And I don't blame her at all...

57
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,166
Barkhorn's sister is the
very reason she's fighting.

58
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:14,208
I think we all have
someone like that...

59
00:05:14,291 --> 00:05:16,833
Someone who we will
defend at all costs...

60
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:18,000
Sometimes that's the only way

61
00:05:18,083 --> 00:05:21,708
to summon any courage
to fight at all.

62
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,166
Yeah.

63
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:29,458
This is a hospital.

64
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:31,208
Be quiet please!

65
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:33,958
I'm so sorry, miss.

66
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,000
I was in a hurry to get here.

67
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,041
Oh Chris.

68
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,333
Hi.

69
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,125
Good to see you...

70
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:55,875
Thanks so much for coming...

71
00:05:55,958 --> 00:05:57,583
Were you okay without me?

72
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:58,583
Uh, of course!

73
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:00,291
Yes...! I'm just fine!

74
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:01,375
Why wouldn't I be?

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,791
Is that what you think of me?

76
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:05,000
She was a complete wreck...

77
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,291
The nightmares were
making her cry out...

78
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:11,166
'Oh my sister, when will my
baby sister ever wake up.'

79
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,250
Is that true?

80
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,708
You shut your mouth.

81
00:06:13,791 --> 00:06:16,083
This is supposed
to be happy reunion.

82
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:17,416
But it's true.

83
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,458
I am a dedicated
soldier of Karlsland...

84
00:06:19,541 --> 00:06:22,250
I give people nightmares...
Got it?!

85
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:25,833
Well, sister... You look happy.

86
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:27,375
Really?

87
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:29,458
You can thank Miyafuji for that

88
00:06:29,541 --> 00:06:30,875
Who's Miyafuji?

89
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:34,458
Well... She's our newest
recruit to the Strike Witches.

90
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,458
She looks a little bit like you.

91
00:06:37,541 --> 00:06:41,625
Like me? Do you think
I could meet her?

92
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:42,666
Why not...?

93
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,208
I think you need
to stop by the base.

94
00:06:44,291 --> 00:06:49,500
Can I...? Do you think
she'll be my friend?

95
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,000
Well, She's a little bit
odd but she is nice...

96
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:54,500
I'm sure the two of you
will be great friends.

97
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:58,000
You two may look alike
but you're much cuter.

98
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,708
Absolutely.

99
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,416
Well... no bias there.

100
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,333
So who left this?

101
00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:11,708
No... clue...

102
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,666
Let's see.

103
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,625
Minna Dietlinde Wilcke.

104
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,958
Well... that's odd.

105
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,625
Major Sakamoto...

106
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,250
Why do I always have to hide?

107
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,833
I should just go tell her.

108
00:07:33,916 --> 00:07:35,041
Here I go.

109
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,833
I don't know what's changed.

110
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:40,083
It used to be easy
to be around her.

111
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,375
What turned me
into nervous wreck

112
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,500
who has to hide
when I see her.

113
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,916
It's all Miyafuji's fault.

114
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,583
Ever since that brat
came hear I've changed.

115
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:53,291
'Scuse me... Major Sakamoto...

116
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,291
I was hoping to learn
your reverse corkscrew

117
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,208
or perhaps you could teach
me the floor press leg-lock.

118
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,833
Miyafuji's room.

119
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,708
Why would she go in there?

120
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:09,291
Why must my life be so filled
with constant disappointment?

121
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,250
Ma'am?

122
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:12,083
You wanted to talk to me?

123
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:15,625
Yes... but 'at ease'...
this is your quarters.

124
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:16,916
Yes ma'am.

125
00:08:20,375 --> 00:08:21,958
You did great.

126
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,333
In yesterday's fight...

127
00:08:23,416 --> 00:08:25,750
You're first core kill, right?

128
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,375
That's right!

129
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:35,875
But it was thanks to all of
the witches, especially you.

130
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:37,416
Because you trained me...

131
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,125
You taught me
how to stay focused.

132
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,791
You're the best
teacher I've ever had.

133
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,250
That was well said, Miyafuji.

134
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,000
It's true. You're still young.

135
00:08:54,083 --> 00:08:56,000
Who knows how much
potential you have?

136
00:08:56,083 --> 00:08:57,083
I'm going to have to

137
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:58,833
do everything in
my power to find out.

138
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:01,250
That means training you
even harder than before.

139
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:03,708
Therefore... Starting
tomorrow I'm going to triple

140
00:09:03,791 --> 00:09:06,416
your training regimen,
how does that sound?

141
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:10,333
I want triple training...

142
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,000
Umm...

143
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:18,625
Don't sneak up on
people like that, okay?!

144
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:25,083
Perrine...

145
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:26,250
...and Lynne...

146
00:09:26,333 --> 00:09:28,208
What are the two of
you doing out here?

147
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,333
Uhh... I saw Perrine
here... and uhh-

148
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,833
What's wrong with you Perrine?

149
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:37,291
Your face is all red.

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,125
There isn't anything
wrong with my face...

151
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,791
It just turns red sometimes.

152
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,000
You could have a fever...

153
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,958
You leave me alone.
My face is fine.

154
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,083
Enough of this. All of you
report for extra training.

155
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:53,041
Oh that reminds me, Yoshika
I have a message to give you.

156
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,958
Well, stop wasting time.

157
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:55,875
Get ready.

158
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:57,666
Yes, ma'am.

159
00:10:02,625 --> 00:10:05,666
Miyafuji, you've got Francesca
closing in from behind.

160
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,166
Uh, okay!

161
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,250
I've got you.

162
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,500
That technique...

163
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,166
This round is
Perrine and Miyafuji's...

164
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,750
Way to go, Yoshika!

165
00:10:27,833 --> 00:10:29,583
How'd we lose?

166
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:30,958
That's so weird...

167
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:33,375
A couple more seconds
and I'd have gotten her.

168
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:35,541
You're really growing
into this, Miyafuji.

169
00:10:35,625 --> 00:10:37,666
Really...? Thank you.

170
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:41,958
I'll be the judge of that...

171
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:42,750
Hey... Let go!

172
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,000
Nope.

173
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,541
Nothing's growing into
anything around here...

174
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:46,833
That's such a tragedy.

175
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:47,875
That's true.

176
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:49,541
Come on you guys!

177
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,041
But your fighting skills
have gotten better.

178
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,875
You think so?

179
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:57,291
But you'd have no chance
against me at high altitude.

180
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,416
Hey Perrine...

181
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,458
we just might make a
better team than we thought.

182
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,500
I don't think so...

183
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,000
Not in a million years.

184
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,916
Kick two, three, four.

185
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,291
Wow, you're just so
amazing, Yoshika...

186
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:10,500
You're the newest witch here.

187
00:11:10,583 --> 00:11:12,958
...but its like you've
been here forever.

188
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:15,958
Come on... You think so...?

189
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,125
I bet Barkhorn would say

190
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,625
I'm still a rookie with
a long way to go.

191
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:23,958
So then I must have an even
longer way to go. Wow...

192
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,458
I'm so jealous of you.

193
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,541
But... there's just some
things you can't practice...

194
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,958
in order to
make them better.

195
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:33,000
Oh yeah... like what?

196
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,125
Just... some things.

197
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:41,958
Miyafuji... where did you learn

198
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,375
that reversal technique
you used in training?

199
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,708
Perrine... Hey,
when did you show up?

200
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:48,291
I've been here the whole time!

201
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,708
The corkscrew reverse is
Major Sakamoto's technique.

202
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,250
When did she teach it to you?

203
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,000
She didn't teach it to me.

204
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:56,125
I just watched and
thought it looked kinda fun.

205
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,416
Don't you lie to me...

206
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,625
It's much too difficult...

207
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,083
or else we'd all
be doing it by now...

208
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:02,541
Yes...

209
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:03,666
I'll bet she's been teaching
you in secret, hasn't she?

210
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,208
It's not fair!

211
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,041
Hold on...

212
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,625
I'm not lying to you.

213
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,666
So you're still trying
to play innocent...

214
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,833
It doesn't work on me.

215
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:12,708
What doesn't work on you?

216
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,500
That's it!

217
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:15,083
Now what?

218
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,625
A... duel...

219
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:19,666
That's the only way we're ever
going to settle this matter.

220
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,083
A duel?!

221
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:27,666
I apologize but I opened
it to see what was inside.

222
00:12:28,625 --> 00:12:32,625
"Don't get involved.
You know too much."

223
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,291
What does that mean?

224
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,375
Very intriguing.

225
00:12:36,458 --> 00:12:38,958
Minna has nothing to hide.

226
00:12:39,041 --> 00:12:40,625
Right, Commander?

227
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,416
I'm sorry... That's right...
No secrets...

228
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:46,208
We've simply been investigating
the Neuroi further.

229
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,500
So what does this note
have to do with that?

230
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,583
Any idea who might
have sent it to you?

231
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,416
Too many of them
to keep track of.

232
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,708
It's true... There
are many in the military

233
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:56,666
who've voiced
their opposition to us...

234
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,375
I'm sure they'd love to see
the witches disbanded.

235
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,875
But... I can take a guess

236
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:03,541
as to who would send
such a foolish warning.

237
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:05,083
There's one reason he would...

238
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,958
He must have gotten his
hands on something big...

239
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:09,750
I don't know what.

240
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:11,916
We're close to it or
he wouldn't be scared.

241
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,458
Who is he?

242
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:18,000
Trevor Maloney. He's a
general in the air force.

243
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:25,875
We're not using those.

244
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,708
We're not...? How come?

245
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:29,041
We're dueling...

246
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,375
Which of course means
using the real guns.

247
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,375
No... I don't want to.

248
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:36,291
I can't shoot at
you using a real gun.

249
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:37,833
Please...

250
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:39,750
We're not going to actually
shoot at each other with them.

251
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:41,291
It just makes it feel more real.

252
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,750
That's so dumb...

253
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:43,958
There's no way I'm going

254
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:46,583
to risk accidentally
shooting another witch?

255
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:47,666
You're scared...

256
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:49,708
but you're always
so confident...

257
00:13:49,791 --> 00:13:52,166
and now you know that
I'm going to show you up.

258
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:52,958
Don't worry...

259
00:13:53,041 --> 00:13:55,000
It's just for show.

260
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,958
Miyafuji, can you read me?

261
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:13,541
The first person to tail the
other for ten seconds wins.

262
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:15,250
Simple as that.

263
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,583
You think you can handle it?

264
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:23,250
It's okay. My safety is on.

265
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,541
There she is.

266
00:14:43,416 --> 00:14:45,125
Come on! Almost there...

267
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,583
Why don't you stop
moving around so much?!

268
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:01,458
It's the alarm.

269
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,500
Do you think it's the Neuroi?

270
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,041
One unit, sector 23...

271
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:08,250
East grid... On a direct
course for London.

272
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:09,666
Commander. This is Perrine.

273
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,250
Miyafuji and I are out training.

274
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:12,916
We're closest to that location.

275
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,625
We will intercept.

276
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:18,625
Training now...? I never
authorized extra training.

277
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:22,125
Your orders are to maintain your
current position... understood?

278
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:22,875
Yes ma'am.

279
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:23,750
Mio!

280
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:24,541
Perrine!

281
00:15:24,625 --> 00:15:25,583
You heard the commander...

282
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,333
We're supposed
to stay right here.

283
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,166
I'm not going to wait... Bye.

284
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,041
Wait! Don't!

285
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:32,041
We can't let it get away.

286
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,000
You are in violation
of direct orders.

287
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:34,916
Get back here.

288
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,500
Don't worry about me Perrine...

289
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:39,666
I'll try to slow it down
until the others can get here.

290
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:43,708
Wait! You have to
come back. Miyafuji!

291
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:46,833
Mio.

292
00:15:47,625 --> 00:15:49,583
So you're really gonna fly?

293
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:52,125
But you can't. I saw it.

294
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,625
Your shield stopped
working during the last battle.

295
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,166
True...

296
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,166
I've done a lot of
thinking about it...

297
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,791
I'm already twenty...

298
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:08,750
My powers aren't as
strong as they used to be.

299
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:10,666
It doesn't matter
how hard I train.

300
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,791
I'm a witch and in the end,
we all have the same fate.

301
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:15,458
Then why push yourself?

302
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,500
I've outlived a lot of
other people in this war...

303
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,666
Even so...

304
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,708
My place is in the sky.

305
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,750
This is about
Miyafuji, isn't it?

306
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,375
She'll be fine on her own.

307
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:29,500
No witch has more
training than her.

308
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:30,875
You've done enough.

309
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,333
Not quite...

310
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:34,291
Miyafuji still has much to learn

311
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:37,375
and much more that
she's capable of doing.

312
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:38,708
Before long now...

313
00:16:38,791 --> 00:16:40,833
she's going to have
to lead the witches...

314
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:42,458
She shouldn't be
content to simply stay

315
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:45,666
in the background
for the rest of her life.

316
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:50,000
I'm so sorry...

317
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:53,500
As long as I can
still fly... I have to...

318
00:16:54,333 --> 00:16:56,083
Mio...

319
00:17:01,916 --> 00:17:05,291
Where is it? I should
be getting close by now.

320
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,750
Found it.

321
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:26,625
It's so small... but
it has to be Neuroi.

322
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,875
I should be able to take
this one down by myself.

323
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,791
The safety's still on!

324
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,333
Got it.

325
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,583
What is it doing's going on?

326
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:08,791
It looks like a human.

327
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:13,541
You're saying she went
after it by herself?

328
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,041
I'm sorry.

329
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:16,708
It's actually my fault she
was out here in the first place.

330
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:18,875
Save it till after we
take down the Neuroi.

331
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,250
Yes ma'am.

332
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,916
Don't get any
funny ideas, Miyafuji.

333
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:31,000
The other Neuroi started
imitating Sanya's singing.

334
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,000
Could they be trying
to be like us?

335
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:35,750
What if...

336
00:18:35,833 --> 00:18:38,458
What if they're trying to
communicate with us.

337
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,875
Oh... It's flying like a witch.

338
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:54,541
Wait...

339
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:57,166
Wait just a minute!

340
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,583
So, um...
It's nice to meet you...

341
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,458
I mean, what's your name?

342
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,291
Wait... Do Neuroi have names?

343
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,791
You're pretty different
from the other Neuroi, huh?

344
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:20,208
Miyafuji is there...

345
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,916
She has to have somehow
made contact with the Neuroi.

346
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,333
However, beyond that Sanya
can't tell us anything further.

347
00:19:26,416 --> 00:19:27,458
I'm sorry.

348
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:30,250
You mean... that she
might be captured.

349
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,416
What's happening?

350
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:33,541
Why don't you order
her back towards us?

351
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,041
We keep trying to
contact her with no luck.

352
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:37,291
Same here.

353
00:19:37,375 --> 00:19:39,125
We've ran through all
the frequencies twice

354
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,375
but all of our
transmissions are jammed.

355
00:19:41,458 --> 00:19:43,416
Miyafuji.

356
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:58,916
Are you trying to play a
game with me...? Hey, wait up!

357
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:04,583
Come on! You're
too quick for me.

358
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:13,625
I'm laughing...
I'm laughing with a Neuroi.

359
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:19,833
Hey...

360
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:21,458
I just don't understand it;.

361
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,750
You don't act like
you could be our enemy.

362
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,041
How far off are
they now, Minnna?

363
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,458
The Neuroi has turned
back toward Gallia...

364
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:48,083
It might be
returning to the hive.

365
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,166
They could be leading
her into a trap.

366
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,416
It looks like another
witch with her...

367
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,000
But I can see a core.
That's a Neuroi.

368
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:22,416
What do you think
you're doing, Miyafuji?!

369
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,500
Sakamoto!

370
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,000
Shoot that thing!

371
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:26,875
Shoot it Miyafuji.

372
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:27,791
Sakamoto...

373
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,500
You don't understand!

374
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:30,333
What are you waiting for?

375
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:31,291
Just shoot it!

376
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:32,916
No! Please wait.

377
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,250
Don't be fooled.

378
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:35,958
It's just mimicking you!

379
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,333
No, its not...
Please just wait...

380
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:39,708
Then let I'll do it.

381
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,916
Damn you!

382
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,583
Major!

383
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:55,083
Sakamoto.

384
00:21:58,916 --> 00:22:01,291
Sakamoto!

385
00:22:01,375 --> 00:22:02,666
Major!

386
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:03,541
What was that...?!

387
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:04,625
What just happened out there?!

388
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:06,875
Sakamoto was shot by the Neuroi!

389
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:09,333
She put up her shield
but she's hurt pretty badly.

390
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:11,833
Major! Major!

391
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:13,250
Listen to me Lieutenant.

392
00:22:13,333 --> 00:22:15,500
You will pursue the Neuroi.

393
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:16,958
But the Major needs attention-

394
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:19,208
Pursue... Right now.

395
00:22:19,291 --> 00:22:21,708
Understood.

396
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,625
Commander Minna...

397
00:22:26,708 --> 00:22:28,416
Mio.

398
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:37,500
Major...

399
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:39,916
Please be okay...

400
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,875
Please, open your eyes...

401
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,083
Can you hear me?

402
00:22:45,166 --> 00:22:47,125
Sakamoto, please!

403
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,833
Answer!

404
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:52,875
Sakamoto!

405
00:24:23,833 --> 00:24:25,916
Why won't anyone
listen to me...?

406
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:28,458
Nobody believes me...

407
00:24:28,541 --> 00:24:31,958
I've got to prove what
I felt with that Neuroi...

408
00:24:32,041 --> 00:24:35,958
Next time on Strike Witches:
"I Want You to Believe."
