1
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,666
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

2
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:35,291
We've got to a life boat.

3
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,041
The ship is going under.

4
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:40,333
Just run...? There has to
be something we can do!

5
00:00:40,416 --> 00:00:41,875
Don't be stupid!

6
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,666
What can we do
without our Striker Units?

7
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,458
Hold on.

8
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,666
Perrine... help me up.

9
00:00:55,125 --> 00:00:57,166
Major you shouldn't!

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,333
We've still got
an ace in the hole.

11
00:01:00,833 --> 00:01:02,500
Right here.

12
00:01:04,208 --> 00:01:05,416
Is that-?

13
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,750
A striker unit!

14
00:01:07,833 --> 00:01:09,166
I'll take off

15
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,875
and try to buy us time
until reinforcements get here.

16
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:14,791
I want you two to get to safety.

17
00:01:14,875 --> 00:01:15,916
Major...

18
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,208
You can't... No...
Let me go with you.

19
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,250
How Perrine?

20
00:01:19,333 --> 00:01:20,833
There's only one Striker.

21
00:01:20,916 --> 00:01:22,250
But... Major.

22
00:01:22,333 --> 00:01:23,791
Wait Major.

23
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:28,041
Let me.

24
00:01:28,125 --> 00:01:29,916
It's time I fly.

25
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,125
What are you saying?

26
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,416
That I'm gonna fly!

27
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Sergeant...!

28
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:18,583
That is not a decision
for you to make!

29
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:19,458
Fine...!

30
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,000
But I'm not ready to give up!

31
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:22,125
Who's giving up?

32
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:24,916
You, if you try
and fly that thing.

33
00:03:25,583 --> 00:03:28,500
You're still too weak to fight!

34
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,958
And if you can't fight
then that means...

35
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:32,125
It means we're giving up...

36
00:03:32,208 --> 00:03:34,375
And I can't do that...

37
00:03:34,458 --> 00:03:37,208
Not without at least
putting up a fight!

38
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:39,916
I made a promise to protect you!

39
00:03:41,833 --> 00:03:43,583
You'll protect me...?

40
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:47,000
I bet you'd be surprised at
how many times I've heard that.

41
00:03:55,041 --> 00:03:57,583
Miyafuji... Prepare to attack!

42
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,416
Right!

43
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:06,333
What is that?

44
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,083
A carrier... but...

45
00:04:08,166 --> 00:04:10,666
Why is it being
attacked by the Warlock?

46
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,291
Strange that you
think I would know.

47
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:14,458
Hold on tight!

48
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,166
Holding!

49
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:21,833
Warlock, ten o' clock...

50
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,500
Altitude... two thousand
meters, right above us.

51
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,750
The right engine sputters
a little at the start,

52
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,375
but don't let that distract you.

53
00:04:31,458 --> 00:04:32,916
Once you get going, you're fine.

54
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,500
Yes ma'am!!

55
00:04:35,583 --> 00:04:36,833
The enemy is here!

56
00:04:36,916 --> 00:04:38,375
Alright, it's time!

57
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:39,958
Right!

58
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,625
Miyafuji!

59
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,000
Major!

60
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:02,958
Come on...! You can do it!

61
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,375
Oh, Miyafuji!

62
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:12,875
Oh no!

63
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,375
Nice work, Perrine!

64
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,458
Thanks!

65
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:31,625
No way... Is that Miyafuji
fighting the Warlock?!

66
00:05:31,708 --> 00:05:33,291
Hurry, we've got to help her!

67
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:34,916
Yeah.

68
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,250
I forgot, this thing
doesn't have any weapons.

69
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,708
Here!

70
00:05:42,583 --> 00:05:44,875
Go for it, Miyafuji!

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,416
What the? Miyafuji?!

72
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:06,875
What exactly are you
planning to do with us?

73
00:06:06,958 --> 00:06:09,125
What do you think, Minna?

74
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,791
You certainly have been
keeping busy, haven't you...?

75
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,708
I guess it's not an easy task
deceiving the witches... is it?

76
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,000
The only way for you
to become stronger

77
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,875
than the Witches was
to use Neuroi technology.

78
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:26,333
You tried to hide your methods
by forcing us to disband...

79
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:29,708
If we were gone, who else would
even think to question you...?

80
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:31,166
A decent plan.

81
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,541
However, Sergeant Miyafuji's
actions exceeded military

82
00:06:33,625 --> 00:06:36,041
understandings and
caused you to slip.

83
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,583
I wish...

84
00:06:37,666 --> 00:06:41,041
I wish we had known to trust
Miyafuji's instincts earlier.

85
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,416
Hey! This doesn't look good!

86
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,083
I think the Akagi is sinking!

87
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:48,250
It looks like the Warlock
is fighting a witch,

88
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,291
but who is it?!

89
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:52,000
Sergeant Miyafuji!

90
00:06:52,083 --> 00:06:53,375
Are you sure?

91
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:56,083
Impossible... You don't
have any strikers to use...

92
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,750
Everything is locked away
in the hanger, isn't it?

93
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:03,375
The signal I'm receiving...
is from Mio's striker.

94
00:07:03,458 --> 00:07:05,375
What? How?!

95
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,750
Not bad at all, Miyafuji!

96
00:07:13,083 --> 00:07:14,791
I've heard to
deceive your enemies...

97
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:16,958
first deceive your friends.

98
00:07:17,041 --> 00:07:18,583
That sounds just like Sakamoto!

99
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,500
I'm betting Miyafuji's
got her hands full

100
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,291
just trying to buy time...

101
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,541
Let's go!

102
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:27,083
Yeah, you're right... Come on!

103
00:07:28,166 --> 00:07:29,875
Hey wait!

104
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,125
I don't get it...

105
00:07:35,208 --> 00:07:37,833
Why is the Warlock
attacking the Akagi?

106
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,166
It's just like the Neuroi.

107
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,916
Neuroi...

108
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,833
If it's a Neuroi, then...

109
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,291
Was that a witch I just saw?

110
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:24,375
Yes.

111
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,666
In fact, she was my friend...

112
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,708
She was the best
friend I've ever had!

113
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,458
No way.

114
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:10,416
This isn't the Neuroi
that was my friend.

115
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:13,625
This one...

116
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,791
is the real enemy!

117
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:36,916
Oh wow.

118
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,500
Yes.

119
00:09:38,583 --> 00:09:41,333
It's amazing that she can hold
her own against that monster.

120
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:00,916
Alright then...
so we're saying that

121
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,833
when Miyafuji flew up there to
make friends with the Neuroi...

122
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:05,208
Those guys freaked out on us

123
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,375
and that's the reason
we have to help her fight...

124
00:10:07,458 --> 00:10:08,958
Does that make sense, Minna?

125
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,416
Yep.

126
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,000
Well...? What do you think?

127
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:15,333
Yeah, sure.

128
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,250
But who are you and
what did you do with Trudy?

129
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,083
Eila! Sanya!

130
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,041
Hi guys, what are you doing?

131
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:23,916
Is everything okay?

132
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,541
Well, uh... we... um... we...

133
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:28,708
It's the train's fault!

134
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,333
We fell asleep and
when we woke up,

135
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:33,083
we were back at
the starting station.

136
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,500
So, ya know, since we're here

137
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,541
we figured we'd see
what was going on...

138
00:10:37,625 --> 00:10:39,125
Right, Sanya?

139
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,125
No... We found out
Yoshika's fighting...

140
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:45,583
So we... We thought maybe
she could use some help.

141
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,083
Sanya! What's wrong with you!

142
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:49,041
You're not a very good liar.

143
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:51,125
I don't think we are, either.

144
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:52,500
Hey! What do you mean?!

145
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:53,916
I'm not lying about anything!

146
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,666
Oh c'mon, who cares?

147
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,625
What do you say we get started?

148
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:34,333
Major...! Keep holding on okay!

149
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,750
I'll be fine... Let go!

150
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,958
No... I'm very sorry Major...

151
00:11:39,041 --> 00:11:41,208
That's one order I won't accept.

152
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:43,791
Sakamoto!

153
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,416
Okay, Now!

154
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,416
I'm ready, let's go!

155
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,000
Francesca?

156
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:22,791
Let go!

157
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:26,083
I can't.

158
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,958
All right!

159
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,708
Nice catch!

160
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:44,958
Welcome back!

161
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:46,625
Yeay!

162
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,625
Wait. Please wait
for me, Yoshika.

163
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,500
I'm almost there!

164
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,708
Hi Lynne!

165
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,458
Hey Lynne! We're over here!

166
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,416
You're late...
We'll let it slide this time.

167
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,333
Hurry it up...
You're the last to arrive.

168
00:13:21,166 --> 00:13:23,208
Right...! Yes ma'am!

169
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,708
We did it.

170
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,708
Nice work, Yoshika!

171
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:21,166
The Akagi...

172
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:22,958
It's sinking, sir.

173
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,833
Thanks for waiting.

174
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:28,791
Yoshika!

175
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,083
You're all back!

176
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,375
I'm quite impressed...
Nice work.

177
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,791
Thank you!

178
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,375
Looks like you won't be
needing these anymore, then.

179
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:42,833
That may not be true.

180
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:46,166
Look over there.

181
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,958
It can't be.

182
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,916
The Warlock, and the Akagi.

183
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,958
Perrine... Thank you.

184
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:41,541
'Kay... Letting go.

185
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,458
Don't worry about me.

186
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,250
Wait... Am I seeing things?

187
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:02,375
The Warlock and the
Akagi have fused together!

188
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:04,625
It's beyond our
control at this point.

189
00:16:04,708 --> 00:16:06,541
Still... We have to try...

190
00:16:06,625 --> 00:16:09,625
This thing is no longer just
a Warlock or a Neuroi...

191
00:16:09,708 --> 00:16:11,791
It's completely different.

192
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,541
We're not going to give up.

193
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:14,916
If the witches can't stop it,

194
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,416
then no one else
will be able to!

195
00:16:20,250 --> 00:16:21,625
It's coming.

196
00:16:24,375 --> 00:16:27,708
Alright, listen up...
All units prepare to attack!

197
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,375
Our targets... are the
Akagi and the Warlock!

198
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:31,958
Right!

199
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,166
The core is in
the Akagi's engine.

200
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:40,041
I don't think we'll be able
to destroy it from the outside.

201
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,250
Which means we'll
have to go inside.

202
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:45,125
I'll go. I know my
way around the interior.

203
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,333
No, Major. I'll go!

204
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,791
I'll be her backup!

205
00:16:49,875 --> 00:16:51,875
Well... I know a
little about the inside

206
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,458
and we don't want
you getting lost...

207
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,541
Thank you, Perrine!

208
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,291
Don't thank me...

209
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:59,791
It's not like this is
some kind of gesture!

210
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,875
Well, it'll be very
comforting for me

211
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,958
to know that you're with them.

212
00:17:05,208 --> 00:17:06,416
Right.

213
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:07,625
Now...

214
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:08,916
The rest of us will
provide cover for them

215
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,625
and clear a path so
that they can fly safely.

216
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,125
Roger!

217
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,750
Commence attack!

218
00:17:24,791 --> 00:17:25,833
You're not gonna let the others

219
00:17:25,916 --> 00:17:27,958
take all the credit
for that, are you?

220
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,333
Hey...! Wait!

221
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,083
See ya later!

222
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,041
Sturm!

223
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,791
Hey, that's my job!

224
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,875
Move to the right.

225
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:43,291
'Kay.

226
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:46,000
Head upward.

227
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:48,833
'Kay.

228
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:52,333
Are you getting sleepy?

229
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,291
I'm okay.

230
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,875
The attacks seem
to be letting up.

231
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,833
So should we go?

232
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,916
Now!

233
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,583
Ready... Go!

234
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:21,041
Is she okay?

235
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:22,750
Go for it, Yoshika!

236
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,333
Time for us to go.

237
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,875
Right.

238
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,083
That's the bulkhead.

239
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,125
Yours, Lynne!

240
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,041
Got it!

241
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,708
No, your weapons!

242
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,958
In here.

243
00:19:01,958 --> 00:19:04,250
We're gonna need
more than one gun.

244
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:07,333
Oh no... But we've
come all this way...

245
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:08,916
What are you doing?

246
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,500
I was planning on saving this
'till we really needed it...

247
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,583
Tonnerre!

248
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:32,958
Yoshika.

249
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:34,000
What are you doing...?

250
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,750
Are you completely crazy?!

251
00:19:35,833 --> 00:19:38,416
Lynne, please... both of you...

252
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:40,083
I need your help.

253
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:57,208
Thanks for everything.

254
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,166
They did it.

255
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,916
It's Yoshika!

256
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:48,125
Yoshika...

257
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,250
You did it!
Yoshika, you're amazing!

258
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,958
I don't know how you
figured that out, but wow!

259
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,500
What's that?

260
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:05,833
Look at the hive.

261
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:09,166
It's disappearing!

262
00:21:09,250 --> 00:21:11,375
We won!

263
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,583
Gallia...

264
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:17,291
My homeland is free...
after all this time.

265
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,041
Amazing...

266
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,416
You're amazing, Yoshika.

267
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,750
So that's it.

268
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,250
Yeah.

269
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,000
Great work, Witches...

270
00:21:44,083 --> 00:21:45,625
All units, return home!

271
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,875
Yes ma'am!

272
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,083
In September of 1944...

273
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,208
The complete
annihilation of the Neuroi

274
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,500
in the Gallia region
was confirmed

275
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:56,958
and the 501st
Joint Fighter Wing--

276
00:21:57,041 --> 00:21:59,625
the Strike Witches--were
officially disbanded,

277
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:02,208
but never forgotten.

278
00:23:24,666 --> 00:23:25,833
And to think,

279
00:23:25,916 --> 00:23:28,125
it all started with just
this letter, didn't it?

280
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:31,208
Yoshika! I need your help!

281
00:23:31,666 --> 00:23:33,458
Michiko! What happened?

282
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,833
I see. I can do this.

283
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,833
Wow... Isn't that amazing!

284
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:54,916
Yes it is... Thanks!

285
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,375
What's that?

286
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:10,875
Ow...

287
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,000
A witch!

288
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,500
Hi...

289
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,541
I'm Amaki with the Army Air
Force, Squad forty-seven...

290
00:24:16,625 --> 00:24:18,041
How are you two doing today?

291
00:24:18,125 --> 00:24:20,791
Uh... We're fine.

292
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:22,791
Do you know Yoshika Miyafuji?

293
00:24:22,875 --> 00:24:25,166
Yeah... I'm Yoshika.

294
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:27,166
Oh... That's great news!

295
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,750
Huh?

296
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,083
I have a letter for you...
from your dad.
