1
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:32,833
Last time, Yoshika was still
having a hard time fitting in.

2
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:35,333
She fell victim to
Perrine's jealousy.

3
00:00:35,416 --> 00:00:38,333
Then, Barkhorn took out her
traumatic past on Yoshika

4
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:42,208
by giving her the cold shoulder
and refusing to mentor her.

5
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,500
The tables turned
when the Neuroi attacked

6
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:47,000
and Yoshika was once
again drawn into battle.

7
00:00:47,083 --> 00:00:50,541
During combat, Captain Barkhorn
was seriously injured by the

8
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:54,750
Neroi, but survived because
of Yoshika's healing powers.

9
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,291
After that moment,
Yoshika finally felt accepted

10
00:00:57,375 --> 00:01:00,083
by the other members
of her squadron

11
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,666
Wait... What are you doing?

12
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:57,125
No... Don't... Lynne, come on...

13
00:02:57,208 --> 00:03:00,791
Oh... wow... They're huge...

14
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:14,208
Yoshika, what's
going on in there?

15
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,625
Are you alright?!

16
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,708
Can you move?

17
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:25,833
I'm fine... I fell.

18
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,750
I know.

19
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:31,250
I um... I had a dream about us.

20
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:34,208
What was it about?

21
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,458
It was nothing!

22
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,875
I don't know! I can't remember!

23
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:45,958
Isn't it funny how
you can just forget?!

24
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,583
Oh... and I swear,
I didn't see anything.

25
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,291
It's funny...

26
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,333
You never stop working, do you?

27
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,666
What...? Of course I do, silly.

28
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,125
I mean last night.

29
00:04:15,208 --> 00:04:17,666
You were dreaming that we
were in formation together.

30
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,083
Wait? We what...?

31
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,000
Oh... Yeah, that.

32
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,500
You mean training...

33
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:25,083
That's all we were doing,
just some flying training. Yep.

34
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,208
I know... That's what I mean...

35
00:04:27,291 --> 00:04:28,875
You're training
even in your sleep.

36
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:30,416
No wonder you're good.

37
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:32,083
But um, hopefully
after yesterday

38
00:04:32,166 --> 00:04:34,458
you can get some real rest...

39
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:35,791
We just fought the Neuroi,

40
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:38,625
so you can forget about
fighting them for a while.

41
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,666
Why did I dream about that...?
It was so weird.

42
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:48,416
It felt so real...
they felt real...

43
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:50,416
Lynne's breasts were...

44
00:04:53,708 --> 00:04:55,666
In my dream I could...

45
00:04:56,291 --> 00:04:57,875
Hey! Miyafuji!

46
00:04:57,958 --> 00:05:01,416
It's not what you think!

47
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:09,000
Are you amused with yourself?

48
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,416
I didn't even see you there!

49
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,625
Me neither! I'm so sorry!

50
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:16,416
You're slacking.

51
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,750
We're going to the beach?

52
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:25,583
That's right.

53
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:27,083
We leave tomorrow morning...

54
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,833
We'll be going to the
eastern coast of this island.

55
00:05:29,916 --> 00:05:35,666
Alright...! The beach...!
I love the sea!

56
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:39,000
Um... Don't you guys
love the sea, too?

57
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,833
Yoshika...

58
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,708
We're going there
to train... not play.

59
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,000
Oh we are?

60
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,791
That's right, Sergeant!

61
00:05:47,875 --> 00:05:49,666
We have to be
prepared for anything.

62
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,708
And that means
in any location...

63
00:05:51,791 --> 00:05:53,875
For example, what are you
going to do if you lose

64
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,500
your flying capability
out at sea and fall in...?

65
00:05:56,583 --> 00:05:59,125
We'll be training for
those types of situations.

66
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:00,125
Aw...

67
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:01,708
What was that, Miyafuji...?!

68
00:06:01,791 --> 00:06:03,541
Do you not want
to train with us?

69
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:07,000
No! I mean yes!
I want to train! I do!

70
00:06:08,208 --> 00:06:10,166
Okay, I want all of
you to meet us here...

71
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:13,375
We will be expecting you
at 1000 hours... Clear?

72
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:14,666
Yes, Commander.

73
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:16,375
Do you understand the
instructions, Sergeant?

74
00:06:16,458 --> 00:06:17,875
Yes!

75
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:19,333
Then will you do me a favor
and convey this information

76
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,708
to Shirley and
Ensign Luccini for us...?

77
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,000
Shirley was working
in the hanger

78
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,416
this morning
so look there ...

79
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:28,833
And Luccini is... She's
probably sleeping somewhere,

80
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:30,500
so I'd suggest
checking the base.

81
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:31,875
Right. Got it.

82
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:32,958
Thank you.

83
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,375
Oh... And there's
one more thing...

84
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:35,541
I suppose I should tell you,

85
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:38,208
you won't be training
the entire day...

86
00:06:38,291 --> 00:06:39,458
In other words...

87
00:06:39,541 --> 00:06:40,958
There will be some
down time between drills,

88
00:06:41,041 --> 00:06:44,125
so, pack a swimsuit.

89
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,041
Yes ma'am, I will...

90
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,416
Um, I'll be right back...

91
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,666
Will you come with me
for just a second? Please.

92
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,500
So much energy.

93
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:56,875
Shirley's in the hanger again?

94
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,750
Yes, since early this morning...

95
00:06:58,833 --> 00:07:01,583
You think she's gonna
come up for air sometime?

96
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,208
It's about to get
noisy around here.

97
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:07,500
What do you think
I should do about a swimsuit?

98
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:09,000
You don't have one?

99
00:07:09,083 --> 00:07:10,791
I do, but it's from last year.

100
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,375
I'm worried it
won't fit anymore.

101
00:07:12,458 --> 00:07:14,666
Lucky! So does that
mean you got bigger, then?

102
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,125
Well, Um, yeah...
but not the way you think.

103
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,875
What was that noise?

104
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,916
I think it came from the hanger.

105
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,083
Let's go!

106
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,875
Shirley!

107
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,916
Yo...! What's up you guys?

108
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,791
Getting into trouble?

109
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,583
Um... we thought
we heard something.

110
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:39,416
Oh... Are you
talking about this.

111
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:41,916
Now check this out.

112
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,500
Oh wow!

113
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,125
It's really neat! And noisy!

114
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,625
Yep... It's lookin' good...

115
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:03,375
Maybe I should
adjust the acceleration

116
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,583
on the front a little bit.

117
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:05,791
Shirley, um... could
you turn it down a bit?

118
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,583
What? I can't hear you.

119
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:10,375
It's really loud...!
My ears hurt...!

120
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:16,583
I can't... Can you
please turn it off?!

121
00:08:16,666 --> 00:08:18,541
Are you trying to
blow my ears out?

122
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,166
I'm so sorry!

123
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,708
But... what is this thing

124
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,166
and what are you
doing in the hanger?

125
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,833
You could really hurt yourself.

126
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,166
Why are you guys yelling?

127
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,833
Lucchini!

128
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,125
Did you come in here
just to wake me up

129
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,291
and put me in a bad mood?

130
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,583
'Cause if so, congratulations.

131
00:08:39,125 --> 00:08:40,083
I'm so sorry!

132
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:41,166
You mean you can
sleep in the hanger

133
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,833
with all this noise around you?

134
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,833
Yeah because that
happens all the time.

135
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,000
It does...?

136
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:48,750
So does that mean
you're down here a lot?

137
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:50,125
What are you working on?

138
00:08:50,208 --> 00:08:52,791
I just finished modifying
the Strikers engine.

139
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,833
You modified the
whole engine...?

140
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,041
What does that mean?

141
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:03,666
I'll be happy
to show you. C'mon.

142
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,250
What does
"modification" mean again?

143
00:09:05,333 --> 00:09:08,625
It means I adjusted the energy
allocation of the magic engine.

144
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,750
And by "allocation" you
mean that you changed

145
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:13,666
the amount of energy we use
for attacking and defense?

146
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,541
Yep, you got it.

147
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,458
So what part of the engine
did you enhance Shirley?

148
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,500
I enhanced the speed.

149
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:21,625
Ready!

150
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,000
Right!

151
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:29,583
Go!

152
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:34,541
Yeah...! Looks great!

153
00:09:34,625 --> 00:09:35,875
Wow... That was fast!

154
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,500
Oh that's nothing.

155
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:46,500
That's quite an improvement.

156
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:49,708
Exactly fifty seconds to reach
an altitude of 1,000 meters.

157
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:52,375
That is by far her
fastest rate of ascent ever.

158
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,541
It is rather loud, though.

159
00:09:57,958 --> 00:09:59,833
Let's see what
she does this time.

160
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,583
Alright Merlin...

161
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:05,333
Magical engine, full output, go!

162
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,333
I can't believe she's
still accelerating!

163
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,791
Yep, Seven Hundred and Seventy!

164
00:10:14,875 --> 00:10:20,625
780... 785... 790... 795...

165
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:21,333
Wow...

166
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,708
800 kilometers!

167
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:25,083
That's a new record!

168
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,000
Woah!

169
00:10:28,083 --> 00:10:29,500
Go!

170
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,333
Come on let's go... Speed it up.

171
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,000
Her acceleration is peaking.

172
00:10:36,083 --> 00:10:37,291
How fast did she go?

173
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:39,583
Just a little over
800 kilometers.

174
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:43,625
I see... So that means she
tops out after reaching 800.

175
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,958
We were right...

176
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:48,083
It would appear that this
was her limit after all.

177
00:10:49,833 --> 00:10:51,166
The speed of sound.

178
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,875
Still remains just
beyond her reach.

179
00:10:58,958 --> 00:10:59,750
That's amazing!

180
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,291
Shirley! You set a new record!

181
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,833
Alright!

182
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,250
Let's go get something to eat!

183
00:11:17,791 --> 00:11:19,458
What, is all this?

184
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:22,375
"New Record Achievement
of Glamorous Shirley..."

185
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:25,000
Um, why are you
in a biker magazine?

186
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,208
I don't know.

187
00:11:26,291 --> 00:11:27,750
I think it's because
she used to ride bikes

188
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:30,166
before she became a pilot.

189
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,666
Have you ever heard
of the Bonneville Flats?

190
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,166
Bonneville?

191
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,916
Yeah, it's a flat made of salt
as far as the eye can see

192
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,833
right in the middle of Liberion 

193
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,416
Wow, I've never heard
of that place before.

194
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,833
I'm not surprised.

195
00:11:43,916 --> 00:11:47,458
It was kinda like a holy
land for us speed freaks.

196
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,958
You could say that
article's the reason

197
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,000
you're graced with
my presence today.

198
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,416
The day it was written,

199
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,208
I was told about these
witches who fly through the air

200
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:03,291
at the world's fastest
speeds with magical engines.

201
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:08,666
I went home that day and applied
to enlist in the military.

202
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:11,791
And now I'm here in a hanger
working with you two ladies.

203
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,250
That's great!

204
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,750
So on your days off you try
to break your speed record

205
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:16,833
with the equipment
you're working on here?

206
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:17,958
You have the top speed...!

207
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,083
That's so amazing...!

208
00:12:20,166 --> 00:12:21,541
But if you're
already at the top,

209
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,166
how fast will you have to
go before you're satisfied?

210
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,125
Never thought about it, huh...

211
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,375
The speed of sound...?

212
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,125
I wanna exceed Mach one someday.

213
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,666
Wait... What do you mean
by "the speed of sound."

214
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,875
It's the speed at
which sound travels...

215
00:12:33,958 --> 00:12:36,291
At about
1200 kilometers per hour.

216
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:39,500
Do you really think it's
possible to go that fast...?

217
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:41,208
The number sounds
almost made up.

218
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,125
Who knows...? I don't...

219
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:46,958
But if we don't chase after our
dreams we'll lose them forever.

220
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,208
'Kay, that's all
I've got for today.

221
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,958
Hang on a sec...

222
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,500
You guys came in here
for something, what was it?

223
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:56,458
Huh?

224
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:59,458
Oh no we forgot!

225
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,208
We're supposed to meet at
1000 hours tomorrow morning.

226
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:05,208
How fun! I can't wait!

227
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,458
Oh, to train somewhere else?

228
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,166
To see you two in swim suits!

229
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,833
It's gonna be okay...

230
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,791
I'll just put it back together,
and no one will notice...

231
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,625
Hold on... These two
look exactly alike.

232
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:47,750
Which one goes on top?

233
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,500
Maybe it was this one...

234
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,250
There. It doesn't
look any different!

235
00:13:56,333 --> 00:13:58,375
I don't think...

236
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,250
My skin is burning.

237
00:14:36,333 --> 00:14:38,458
I'm hungry.

238
00:14:38,541 --> 00:14:39,791
I don't understand?

239
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,833
Why do we have to wear these?!

240
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,708
You'll need them in
a marine emergency.

241
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:47,500
I don't like repeating
myself, Sergeant.

242
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,500
Alright girls, everyone else
has completed their training...

243
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,875
Looks like you two
are the only ones left.

244
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:55,833
So stop wasting time
and... get... in... there!

245
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:06,875
They're not coming up.

246
00:15:06,958 --> 00:15:09,333
Nope.

247
00:15:20,041 --> 00:15:22,375
I guess this means
they won't be flying.

248
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,666
Do you think we're
pushing them too hard?

249
00:15:30,416 --> 00:15:31,375
This isn't the kiddy pool.

250
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:32,666
Stop dog paddling...!

251
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:34,791
Take a page out
of Perrine's book!

252
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:38,916
So sad.

253
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,208
It's heavy...
I can't... Help...!

254
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:50,291
I'm sleepy.

255
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:53,125
Okay everyone...!
Time for a break!

256
00:16:06,125 --> 00:16:08,000
I... can't move...

257
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:09,708
Me neither...

258
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:12,458
They lied to us Lynnette...

259
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,000
They said we'd have breaks,

260
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:16,750
but... they still haven't
stopped torturing us.

261
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,250
You get used to it.

262
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,500
Hi, Shirley.

263
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:24,375
It gets easier... trust me...

264
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,625
And besides you get
to train on the beach...

265
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,166
Nothin' wrong with that.

266
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:46,000
This feels so good... I love it!

267
00:16:46,083 --> 00:16:48,708
Yeah... me, too!

268
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,625
And me three!

269
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,666
What's that...?

270
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,833
What's the matter?

271
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,875
I dunno... I saw something...

272
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:03,333
It was flying across the sun.

273
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:04,958
What was it?

274
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,500
The enemy!

275
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:12,291
Neuori!

276
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,250
Shirley, hold on!

277
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,541
It's an enemy craft...

278
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,291
It appears to have slipped
through the radar net.

279
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:26,750
Damn...

280
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:28,583
The second time it's been
two days ahead of schedule.

281
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:29,875
Who do we have?

282
00:17:29,958 --> 00:17:31,791
Shirley and the others
are already on the move.

283
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:41,458
Wow... She even runs fast.

284
00:17:56,625 --> 00:18:00,041
This is Yeager... Taking off.

285
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,208
Shirley, wait!

286
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,708
Are you okay?

287
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,791
We gotta go!

288
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:20,958
Shirley... Can you hear me?

289
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,083
Yes ma'am!

290
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:24,000
We've spotted an enemy craft.

291
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:25,666
An ultra high-speed model...

292
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,166
It's already moving inland.

293
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:28,541
What is its course?

294
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:32,375
Current heading, west/northwest
from your location.

295
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:37,166
Judging by its course...
its target is...

296
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,041
London.

297
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,583
Heading to London!

298
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:43,291
Single units take the lead!

299
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:44,875
Shirley, this one's all you.

300
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,041
Show them your speed.

301
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,583
Yes ma'am!

302
00:18:53,708 --> 00:18:55,625
Look how far she is already...!

303
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,916
Lynne, c'mon, we've gotta hurry!

304
00:18:58,375 --> 00:18:59,208
Come on, Shirley...

305
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,375
Please don't, let us down...

306
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:06,416
Oh no... Shirley's left
the hanger already...

307
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,625
Uh oh.

308
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:09,291
I really hope I put
it back together right.

309
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,125
You put what back
together right?

310
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,916
Well, um, last night
Shirley's striker was,

311
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,375
I mean, I may or may not have...

312
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:20,583
Um, nothing... I... forgot.

313
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:21,958
Are you sure about that...?

314
00:19:22,041 --> 00:19:25,291
I suggest you try to
remember, Ensign Luccini.

315
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:33,041
What's happening?

316
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,833
Something feels different.

317
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:37,875
Lieutenant...!

318
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,875
...ust... ...iately...!

319
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,916
I repeat...
Come in Lieutenant...!

320
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,666
You must return to the base...!

321
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,000
I repeat...
Lieutenant Shirley...

322
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:46,041
Where are they?

323
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,416
Time's running out.

324
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,291
They need to catch up quickly.

325
00:19:49,708 --> 00:19:51,416
She's just getting farther away!

326
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,583
We'll never catch up to her now.

327
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:59,541
Strange... the acceleration
isn't slowing down...

328
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,916
The engine must be
doing better today.

329
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,166
...to the base... Lieu...

330
00:20:07,250 --> 00:20:08,750
I recognize this feeling...

331
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,916
It's the same...

332
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:14,333
It's just like that day...

333
00:20:21,291 --> 00:20:22,666
Return to base immediately!

334
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,208
Do you copy?!

335
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:53,083
Did I do it...?

336
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:54,333
Did I break Mach 1...?

337
00:20:54,416 --> 00:20:57,625
Is this what supersonic
speed feels like?

338
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,458
Wow...! Awesome!

339
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:03,083
I did it! I really did it!

340
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:05,208
Do you copy,
Lieutenant?! Answer me!

341
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,583
Major! I finally did it...!

342
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:08,958
I exceeded the speed of sound!

343
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,875
Stop! You're going to
crash into the enemy!

344
00:21:13,458 --> 00:21:14,541
Oh no...

345
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:32,916
The enemy's been destroyed.

346
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,208
What about Shirley?

347
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:36,083
She's um...

348
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,208
She's... She's fine!

349
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:42,041
She made it!
Shirley's gonna be okay!

350
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:07,500
Oh no! She's not gonna be okay!

351
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:27,000
Oh no I...

352
00:22:27,083 --> 00:22:28,750
What is it?! What happened?!

353
00:22:28,833 --> 00:22:30,750
It's nothing! She's fine Major!

354
00:22:30,833 --> 00:22:31,916
Shirley's been rescued but...

355
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,583
Yeah? But what?!

356
00:22:33,666 --> 00:22:35,750
Wow...! They're gigantic!

357
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,833
Yoshika...! What do
you think you're doing?!

358
00:22:39,916 --> 00:22:40,958
Dammit, Sergeant?!

359
00:22:41,041 --> 00:22:43,208
I demand you tell
me what's going on!

360
00:22:44,416 --> 00:22:45,375
I'm sorry Major!

361
00:22:45,458 --> 00:22:47,708
It's too hard to explain!

362
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:52,125
I'm so hungry!

363
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:26,916
Isn't Sanya's voice beautiful?

364
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,166
That's kind of what

365
00:24:28,250 --> 00:24:30,333
the next episode is all
about--Sanya--finally...

366
00:24:30,416 --> 00:24:32,083
Sanya from the left,
Sanya from the right!

367
00:24:32,166 --> 00:24:34,375
It's going to be
the best episode ever!

368
00:24:34,458 --> 00:24:36,958
Next time on Strike Witches:
"We're the Same."
