1
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,208
That's the--

2
00:00:38,666 --> 00:00:41,208
Nicely done, Commander Minna.

3
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,083
I guess you're
in charge... right...?

4
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,666
General Maloney.

5
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:45,958
Yes I am.

6
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,916
Here's a copy of the
official transfer order...

7
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,750
So Commander Minna.

8
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,375
As of now... this base is
under the direct command

9
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:55,625
of the 1st Strategic
Airborne Assault Team...

10
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:58,791
That's a mouthful to say so
we're referred to as Warlock.

11
00:00:58,875 --> 00:01:01,041
Warlock?!

12
00:01:11,666 --> 00:01:14,958
Now that I have all
of the witches present...

13
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,291
Am I addressing
Sergeant Yoshika Miyafuji?

14
00:01:22,375 --> 00:01:23,916
Sir.

15
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,875
You left the base in breach
of military regulations...

16
00:01:27,958 --> 00:01:30,250
Isn't that right?

17
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,708
Oh no...

18
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,625
I've seen that...

19
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:43,125
Are you referring
to the Warlock?

20
00:01:43,208 --> 00:01:44,625
Yes, I've seen it.

21
00:01:44,708 --> 00:01:48,125
It was in a room with the
Neuroi, some sort of laboratory.

22
00:01:48,958 --> 00:01:51,416
You don't know what
you're talking about.

23
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,416
That's not true. I saw it!

24
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:54,958
Answer my question now...

25
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:57,833
You deserted your
squad... Correct?

26
00:01:57,916 --> 00:02:00,666
Yes... but I-

27
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:02,666
And you... I issued
you orders

28
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:05,750
to shoot this deserter down
the moment you made contact.

29
00:02:05,833 --> 00:02:07,000
Yes... but sir...

30
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:09,166
A junior officer flying
military hardware

31
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:11,208
in violation of
her house arrest.

32
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:13,041
A senior officer
disobeying shoot

33
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:14,708
to kill orders from a General.

34
00:02:14,791 --> 00:02:17,000
The breakdown in the
chain of command is clear.

35
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,375
At times like this I am left

36
00:02:18,458 --> 00:02:22,375
with no other options to
preserve military order.

37
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,583
Commander Minna be advised...

38
00:02:24,666 --> 00:02:27,708
The 501st Joint Fighter Wing
has been dissolved...

39
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:30,833
The Strike Witches are
officially disbanded.

40
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,291
You have each
been reassigned back

41
00:02:35,375 --> 00:02:38,583
to your home
country's main unit.

42
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,083
That is all...

43
00:02:40,166 --> 00:02:42,500
Is that understood, Commander?

44
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:45,500
Understood, sir.

45
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,708
No...

46
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:49,291
The witches are disbanded.

47
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:52,375
Your unauthorized actions
were the cause of all this...

48
00:02:52,458 --> 00:02:54,291
Sergeant Miyafuji.

49
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:58,875
But I... I ... I just...

50
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:00,291
No need to worry...

51
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:01,333
We'll be fine...

52
00:03:01,416 --> 00:03:02,416
The Warlock has been designed

53
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,708
to completely
annihilate the Neuroi.

54
00:03:04,791 --> 00:03:08,041
Britannia no longer needs
the protection of witches.

55
00:05:06,208 --> 00:05:09,416
Hey... where is everyone?

56
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,375
Where'd you go?!

57
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:18,208
Yoshika. Yoshika.

58
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,958
Yoshika, wake up.

59
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,666
You're all right... That's good.

60
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:29,166
Hey Lynne... everyone...

61
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,208
What's up?

62
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,083
You collapsed out on
the runway after we heard.

63
00:05:34,166 --> 00:05:35,750
It's probably the
combination of shock

64
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,541
and fatigue that
caused you to pass out.

65
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:40,041
No...!

66
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:42,333
There's something not right
about that Warlock thing...

67
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:45,208
Hey... I bet if we all
just looked into it-

68
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,166
Um Lynne... What's wrong?

69
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,375
It's orders...

70
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,125
We're not left with
any other choice except

71
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,291
to go back to our
home countries.

72
00:05:55,375 --> 00:06:00,958
So then the witches are really
disbanded...! It's true?

73
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,833
Yeah.

74
00:06:06,333 --> 00:06:08,958
Then... it's my fault...

75
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,958
Sorry

76
00:06:11,291 --> 00:06:13,166
No its not.

77
00:06:13,583 --> 00:06:15,250
I'm so sorry...

78
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:17,458
I shouldn't have gone...

79
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,500
I'm so stupid.

80
00:06:19,583 --> 00:06:21,291
You're not...
We're all with you.

81
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:23,666
Cheer up... it'll be fine.

82
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,416
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:32,416
It's all my fault.

84
00:06:41,791 --> 00:06:43,125
Let's go.

85
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:44,958
'kay.

86
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,500
Wow, I hope that thing
can make it to Romagna.

87
00:07:21,583 --> 00:07:22,583
Big deal.

88
00:07:22,666 --> 00:07:23,916
I have to cross the Atlantic

89
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,375
in that bucket after
dropping you off.

90
00:07:58,416 --> 00:07:59,583
General Maloney.

91
00:07:59,666 --> 00:08:02,250
All witches have
vacated the area.

92
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:05,208
That's good news.

93
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:07,291
Like hell that's
good news Lieutenant...

94
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:10,125
We couldn't possibly
ask for worse timing.

95
00:08:10,208 --> 00:08:13,166
Coming out into the open
this early was not our plan.

96
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:15,958
We currently only have
one operational Warlock.

97
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,833
But Sir...

98
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:19,416
We couldn't stay hidden forever.

99
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,000
That's true...

100
00:08:21,083 --> 00:08:24,916
But our timetable acceleration
is all that little girl's fault.

101
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:28,000
If she hadn't made contact
with the Neuroi we could have

102
00:08:28,083 --> 00:08:31,041
progressed as planned with
the Warlock anonymously.

103
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:35,208
Do you think that it was wise
to let her return to Fuso?

104
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:38,916
What do we have to fear from a
Witch without her Striker Unit?

105
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
She's only a little girl...

106
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,875
We have nothing to worry about.

107
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,000
Farewell, Britannia.

108
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,500
I'll miss you.

109
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,625
Perrine... I'm sorry...

110
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,958
I'm making you take
me all the way to Fuso.

111
00:09:04,041 --> 00:09:05,000
Don't worry...

112
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,875
I'd prefer to be
of use to you Major.

113
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:10,291
Besides, it's not like I really
have any home to return to.

114
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:20,875
Sergeant Miyafuji...
I'm sorry...

115
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:24,375
When I brought you here I had
no idea it would end this way.

116
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:28,041
Britannia is a long way
away from your family in Fuso.

117
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:28,916
Please don't.

118
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,833
There's no need to be sorry...

119
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:34,125
I only wish I could have been
of more help to the witches.

120
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:37,916
As it is, it's my fault
we're all going home.

121
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:40,416
But still...

122
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,625
I can't...

123
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:45,458
regret the opportunity
to be at that base.

124
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:49,000
Everything I learned and
all the wonderful people.

125
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:53,041
I'll always treasure every
moment with the Strike Witches.

126
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:55,708
That's good...

127
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,875
Their surveillance
has finally stopped.

128
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,375
Maybe we should have just
gone back to Karlsland...

129
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:17,583
At least there we'd know

130
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:19,916
which enemy we were
really fighting against.

131
00:10:23,583 --> 00:10:24,708
What's wrong?

132
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,625
It was your idea for
us to come back here.

133
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,458
Well yeah... be... cause...

134
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:32,833
uh... Miyafuji that's all.

135
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:36,041
I know... She's hard to resist.

136
00:10:36,125 --> 00:10:39,125
It's just... we...
we at least owe it to her

137
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,250
to uncover what's
really been going on...

138
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:42,750
I couldn't call
myself a true soldier

139
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:45,291
of Karlsland if I didn't-

140
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:49,375
It's okay...

141
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,250
I think you've
explained enough...

142
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:52,708
Besides...

143
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:55,041
I'm still concerned about
what Miyafuji said before...

144
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,416
You mean about being
friends with the Neuroi?

145
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:02,000
No... about her seeing visions
of the Warlock with the Neuroi.

146
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:04,000
From his reaction
to Miyafuji's story,

147
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:06,458
it appeared General Maloney
was hiding something...

148
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:09,000
We need to figure out
just what he's up to.

149
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,166
If the General's
acting without orders...

150
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:13,958
that will give us enough
reason to take him down.

151
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,375
Absolutely.

152
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,625
Good.

153
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,291
The question is what
is our first priority?

154
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,500
Hey!

155
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,916
How about a ride?!

156
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:27,625
Hi!

157
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:31,500
You, jerk!

158
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:34,541
You wouldn't know
sexy if it bit you!

159
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:02,000
Warlock Unit zero...
Ready for takeoff.

160
00:12:02,541 --> 00:12:05,083
Coordinates set
for the Gallia region.

161
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:06,125
Go.

162
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:09,208
Warlock Unit zero...
Go for launch.

163
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,208
Transformation to
flight mode complete.

164
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,375
Course confirmed
to Gallia Region.

165
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,500
Cruising at subsonic speed.

166
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:32,791
Perfect...

167
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:36,250
The Warlock outperforms
those witches... in every way.

168
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:40,041
All our research
is finally paying off.

169
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,916
But sir, the chief of
engineering feels that its still

170
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,791
too soon to put the
Warlock into combat

171
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,500
without the proper testing.

172
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,958
I'm aware of his concerns,
but with the witches now exiled,

173
00:12:51,041 --> 00:12:53,500
we aren't left
with any other option.

174
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:56,708
The warlock must
produce results...

175
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,291
With the Neuroi eliminated...

176
00:12:59,375 --> 00:13:00,750
our new hardware should put us

177
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:03,416
at the top of the
world's food chain.

178
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,375
They're already
trying to control Gallia.

179
00:13:07,458 --> 00:13:08,833
Busy Beavers.

180
00:13:08,916 --> 00:13:10,250
If they can use this opportunity

181
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:13,000
to demonstrate the
Warlocks superior abilities ...

182
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,125
They'll gain the approval
to begin mass production.

183
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:18,208
The Warlock's strong...
but I can't believe they're

184
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,958
going into battle
with just one Unit.

185
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,708
It still seems like
there's something else

186
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:25,000
they're trying to hide
about the Warlock

187
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,833
This is a perfect chance
to see what their up to.

188
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:30,125
What's wrong?

189
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,291
You're excited...

190
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,250
Is this all for Miyafuji?

191
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:35,666
No... that's not it.

192
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,458
Let's keep our eyes on them.

193
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,333
Right.

194
00:13:47,291 --> 00:13:48,958
It's the Warlock.

195
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:50,500
I don't like that sound.

196
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:52,833
I wonder where it's going?

197
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:54,833
Stupid!

198
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,500
Hey, now.

199
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,375
Bring me portside.

200
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,916
Yes ma'am.

201
00:14:14,583 --> 00:14:15,916
They're going to Gallia.

202
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,958
That sure didn't take long.

203
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,541
The Neuroi hive...

204
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,583
Destroyed it in one shot.

205
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,833
That thing is unbelievable.

206
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,000
I don't get it... how did
the Warlock get access

207
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:53,458
to Neroi beam technology?

208
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,333
What is it Miyafuji?

209
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,625
That's it...

210
00:14:57,708 --> 00:14:59,916
The Neuroi was showing it to me.

211
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:05,250
She wanted me to know
that they'd met before.

212
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:08,291
There's only one way the Warlock
could talk to the Neuroi.

213
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:09,666
But that's impossible...

214
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,583
The Neuroi are our sworn enemy.

215
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,333
If they obtained
Neuroi technology

216
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:14,708
they'd have told us by now...

217
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,541
It just doesn't make any
sense to keep that from us.

218
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,875
But...

219
00:15:18,958 --> 00:15:21,208
Normally I'd say you're crazy...

220
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,291
however... it all adds up.

221
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:28,291
It would seem as if the Neuroi
aren't the witch's only enemy...

222
00:15:28,375 --> 00:15:31,000
Well, then... it looks
like your rebellious actions

223
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,916
may not have been
in vain after all.

224
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:38,333
Warlock Unit 0 has
taken out the Neuroi.

225
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:41,208
Yes... that's right...

226
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:44,750
Our power has already
exceeded that of the Neuroi.

227
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,750
What's that...?
What's going on soldier?

228
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:58,083
Two Neuroi craft inbound.

229
00:15:58,166 --> 00:15:59,750
Not two... it's three!

230
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,625
What?

231
00:16:00,708 --> 00:16:03,083
Who cares...? Destroy them all.

232
00:16:15,083 --> 00:16:16,458
That's strange...

233
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:19,458
The Neuroi has completely
changed its attack pattern.

234
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,625
What's this?

235
00:16:22,708 --> 00:16:24,708
I don't understand.

236
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,500
Now there are eight Neuroi...

237
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:27,750
No, nine!

238
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:30,750
The Warlock has reached
its maximum capacity.

239
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:35,083
Activate the Warlock's
core hijacking system.

240
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:37,333
But we only have
one Warlock active...?

241
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:39,083
It takes five to generate
enough resonance

242
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,291
to control the
core fields.... sir.

243
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,875
The core control system
has been activated remotely.

244
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:47,958
What?

245
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:49,333
I don't know how but the Warlock

246
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:52,708
has activated the core
hijacking system on its own.

247
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:57,583
What's happening?

248
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:01,291
I've never seen
that many Neuroi.

249
00:17:14,083 --> 00:17:17,250
The Warlock's core control
system is functioning perfectly.

250
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:20,625
It now has control of
all the surrounding Neuroi.

251
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,958
Look at that!

252
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:40,583
Can't be... the Neuroi are
attacking the other Neuroi

253
00:17:40,666 --> 00:17:43,625
But why...?
Is it just a mistake?

254
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,416
It's no mistake.

255
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:48,041
The Warlock is
controlling the Neuroi.

256
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,083
How can that be?

257
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:05,375
The Neuroi have been eliminated.

258
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,541
Sir! What's wrong?

259
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:09,833
The signal's gone.

260
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,208
We've lost control of the unit.

261
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:15,916
Looks like its over...

262
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,833
The Warlock defeated them.

263
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,833
But... the Neroi
fought themselves...

264
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,708
Yes.

265
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,958
They were definitely
attacking each other.

266
00:18:40,125 --> 00:18:42,083
It's coming back.

267
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,375
It appears the unit
that was fighting

268
00:18:43,458 --> 00:18:45,666
the Neuroi is headed
back this way, sir.

269
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:48,041
Let's hope its friendly.

270
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,250
That attack came
from the Warlock!

271
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:05,666
Sir, The Carrier Akagi is
being attacked by the Warlock.

272
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:07,000
What?

273
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:09,875
The Warlock's gone crazy...
I can't control it.

274
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:10,958
Try again.

275
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:13,500
Sir, I recommend
the emergency failsafe.

276
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,708
No... That is our
only Warlock...

277
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,125
We have to get it back under
our control immediately.

278
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,250
But sir...
it's turned against us.

279
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,458
We can't just stand by

280
00:19:21,541 --> 00:19:23,958
and do nothing while
it destroys our allies.

281
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:27,250
Fine... shut down.

282
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:29,916
Initiating Warlock failsafe
on the General's orders.

283
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,083
Sir, failsafe set and ready.

284
00:19:31,166 --> 00:19:32,708
Ready, sir.

285
00:19:32,791 --> 00:19:33,958
Anti-aircraft batteries.

286
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:36,333
Ready the 40 mils -
amidships, fore and aft!

287
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:37,208
Fire at will.

288
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,166
Fire! Fire! Fire!

289
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:49,166
Activating Warlock
Forced Shutdown System.

290
00:19:51,166 --> 00:19:53,833
Let's shut it down... now!

291
00:20:12,583 --> 00:20:13,041
Wait!

292
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:13,875
What's wrong?!

293
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,916
Why isn't it shutting down?

294
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:21,375
Our base!

295
00:20:21,458 --> 00:20:24,000
But where did that
beam come from?

296
00:20:24,083 --> 00:20:26,000
We have to go.

297
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,708
The starboard
main deck's been hit!

298
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,375
Thirty-eights two
and three are gone!

299
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,416
Fire crew to engineering.

300
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:39,875
Contain that blaze.

301
00:20:39,958 --> 00:20:41,625
Engine room bulkhead's
been breached.

302
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:44,250
Seal the secondary!

303
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,208
I'm coming.

304
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,666
Let's get going.

305
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,666
Good team work ladies.

306
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,333
Thank you.

307
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:17,583
Look.

308
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,791
What is it?

309
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:20,500
Let's find out.

310
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,666
Yahooo!!!

311
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,916
The ship... on fire.

312
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,625
Oh no!

313
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:53,458
Abandon ship! Abandon ship!

314
00:21:53,541 --> 00:21:54,875
We've got to get to a life boat.

315
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,958
The ship is going under.

316
00:21:57,291 --> 00:22:00,125
Just run...? There has to
be something we can do!

317
00:22:00,208 --> 00:22:01,458
Don't be stupid...

318
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:04,541
What can we hope to do
without our Striker Units?

319
00:22:10,541 --> 00:22:12,416
Hold on.

320
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,625
Perrine... help me up.

321
00:22:14,708 --> 00:22:16,250
Major, you shouldn't.

322
00:22:18,291 --> 00:22:20,375
We've still got
an ace in the hole.

323
00:22:21,125 --> 00:22:22,625
Right here.

324
00:22:24,541 --> 00:22:25,583
Is that-?

325
00:22:25,666 --> 00:22:27,541
A striker unit?

326
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:29,458
I'll take off

327
00:22:29,541 --> 00:22:32,000
and try to buy us time until
reinforcements get here.

328
00:22:32,791 --> 00:22:35,041
I want you two to get to safety.

329
00:22:35,125 --> 00:22:36,000
Major...

330
00:22:36,083 --> 00:22:37,375
You can't. No...

331
00:22:37,458 --> 00:22:38,583
Let me go with you.

332
00:22:38,666 --> 00:22:39,583
How Perrine?

333
00:22:39,666 --> 00:22:41,083
There's only one Striker.

334
00:22:41,166 --> 00:22:42,750
But... Major...!

335
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:44,291
Wait Major.

336
00:22:46,375 --> 00:22:48,458
Let me.

337
00:22:48,541 --> 00:22:50,291
It's time I fly.

338
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:26,541
I want to help however I can.

339
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,000
It's time to spread our
wings and never give up!

340
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:31,458
We have to fly!

341
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,750
The future depends on it.

342
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:37,291
Next time, the final episode:
"Strike Witches"!
