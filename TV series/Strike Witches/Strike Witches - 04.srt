00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,750
Last week the 501st
Joint Fighter Wing,

2
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,500
gained a new
recruit--Yoshika Miyafuji.

3
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:38,333
Yoshika was paired up with
another rookie, Lynette Bishop,

4
00:00:38,416 --> 00:00:41,791
and the two spent many
arduous days training together.

5
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,875
However, even after
enduring many hardships

6
00:00:43,958 --> 00:00:46,583
with her, Lynnette just
couldn't seem to open up.

7
00:00:46,666 --> 00:00:48,875
She felt embarrassed
of her own shortcomings

8
00:00:48,958 --> 00:00:51,000
and was afraid of what
Yoshika might think.

9
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,083
But during an attack,
the two worked together

10
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:55,583
and Lynnette attained
her first war achievement,

11
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,375
as well as a new friend.

12
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,291
Chris, no!

13
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:23,500
Why that dream again...?
Why now?

14
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,083
Yoshika, did you hear...?

15
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,958
They're having Kauhava Base
mobilized for a missing child.

16
00:03:37,041 --> 00:03:39,166
Isn't that wonderful?

17
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,541
I didn't know they did
operations like that here...

18
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,750
That's really cool of them.

19
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:46,875
And to think, it's
all for just one child.

20
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,375
Of course.

21
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,208
How can we save a country if
we can't help one person...?

22
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:53,541
It's such a beautiful statement
and makes me proud to be here.

23
00:03:53,625 --> 00:03:55,125
Yeah, I agree.

24
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:57,458
We can't save everyone...

25
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:58,458
Doesn't matter what you do.

26
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,250
Someone always gets left behind.

27
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:02,500
Wait... What do you mean?

28
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:03,708
Nothing...

29
00:04:03,791 --> 00:04:05,541
I was just talking to myself.

30
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,208
Good morning!

31
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:09,458
Did everyone sleep ok?

32
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,208
What is this stuff?

33
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,375
That looks fattening

34
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,083
Is there something
wrong, Trudy...?

35
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:20,125
What's with the
long face this morning?

36
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:21,750
You haven't even
touched your food.

37
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:22,458
I have, too.

38
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:23,666
There was a lot of it.

39
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:25,541
That's what people
say when they're upset

40
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:26,875
and don't want to eat...

41
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:29,000
I know something's wrong now.

42
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,666
What's wrong Yoshika?

43
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:37,708
Nothing...

44
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,166
I just got a really
weird feeling--

45
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,041
like someone was watching me.

46
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:42,666
Who do you think it was?

47
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:45,041
Maybe just my imagination.

48
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,250
I want seconds!

49
00:04:46,333 --> 00:04:47,833
Coming!

50
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:55,208
Oh no... I'm so sorry.
Did you not like it?

51
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,958
Do I get seconds or not?

52
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,250
Oh, right! Of course
you do! I'm very sorry!

53
00:05:04,333 --> 00:05:06,333
Honestly, I can't say
that I blame her...

54
00:05:06,416 --> 00:05:08,333
I mean you've
served us rotten beans!

55
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:09,708
No one should have to eat that.

56
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,125
Are you trying to poison us?

57
00:05:11,208 --> 00:05:13,333
Not at all. Sakamoto
said she liked it...

58
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,625
It's just natto. It's
really good for you.

59
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,916
Did you just call the
Major "Sakamoto"...?

60
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,041
You shall address her
as "Major," got it...?

61
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:21,666
I don't even call
her "Sakamoto...!"

62
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,291
Well, not all the time...
of course... I mean...

63
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:25,541
Whatever. It doesn't matter...!

64
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,041
I really don't care if
she likes it or not...!

65
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:29,125
This stuff smells
absolutely horrible

66
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,125
and you should never
ever make it again!

67
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,666
Hey, I'm still hungry!

68
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,541
Okay! I'm sorry!

69
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,083
Wow! That's amazing!

70
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,583
It's Captain Barkhorn

71
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,166
and Lieutenant Hartmann
doing formations.

72
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,791
She's not keeping up.

73
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,791
No, she's a little slow today.

74
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,000
That's so strange.

75
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:04,166
Barkhorn is usually
such a perfectionist...

76
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:05,458
Do you think maybe
we should take her off

77
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,166
the next shift so she can rest?

78
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:10,208
Perhaps, it'll be disconcerting
if we can't use our ace.

79
00:06:10,291 --> 00:06:11,666
I know exactly what you mean...

80
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,000
Even though the others
have gotten better,

81
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:15,750
we still won't have enough
firepower without her.

82
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:18,416
I wonder if she's burnt
out from too much training.

83
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,625
I don't think so...

84
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:21,500
Seems like something
else is bothering her.

85
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:22,750
Hmm?

86
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,625
I think it has something
to do with Miyafuji.

87
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,041
You sound certain.

88
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,416
I am.

89
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,208
Let's try pairing them up.

90
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:40,625
You again!

91
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:41,583
What was that for?!

92
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:44,375
I'm so sorry!

93
00:06:46,666 --> 00:06:48,208
Here, you can use this.

94
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,458
No, thank you!

95
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:51,708
So pathetic...

96
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,500
It's like you don't pay
attention to anything.

97
00:06:53,583 --> 00:06:55,875
You're so scattered!

98
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:03,458
Um... Hi...!

99
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:06,208
Hello? Sergeant Miyafuji...?!

100
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:07,958
Turn around when
someone is talking to you!

101
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,708
That's so rude!

102
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:17,750
I don't get it.

103
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:20,458
Why am I remembering it now?

104
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:26,000
Her external
injuries have healed,

105
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:28,833
but there's no sign that
she will regain consciousness,

106
00:07:28,916 --> 00:07:30,625
perhaps due to shock...

107
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,291
Are you sure?

108
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:35,000
This city needs
your attention...

109
00:07:35,083 --> 00:07:37,458
Your sister is still
scheduled to leave

110
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,416
with me on the next
boat to Britannia...

111
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,541
You still okay with that?

112
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:46,375
Yes... Please hurry.

113
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,958
Chris...

114
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:53,291
I'm so sorry.

115
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:00,625
Yoshika's late.
I hope she's okay.

116
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,458
I'm here! Sorry I'm late!

117
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,166
What happened?

118
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,166
I was worried about you.

119
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,333
I was cleaning...!

120
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:08,250
This place is huge!

121
00:08:08,333 --> 00:08:09,500
It took me forever!

122
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:12,500
I'm sorry... But,
I'm ready to help you now.

123
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:16,708
What's the matter, Yoshika?

124
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:18,166
Just thinking...

125
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,875
I get the feeling that
Barkhorn doesn't like me.

126
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:21,750
Huh...?

127
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,000
Why would you say that?

128
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,250
I dunno.

129
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,208
It just seems like
she's always avoiding me.

130
00:08:26,291 --> 00:08:28,291
Oh don't worry about it...

131
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,416
Captain Barkhorn is
like that to everyone.

132
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,291
It doesn't mean anything.

133
00:08:35,083 --> 00:08:36,333
I take that back.

134
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,166
She's not like that to
Hartmann or the Commander.

135
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,416
How come?

136
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:40,666
In the beginning it was
just the three of them.

137
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:42,541
They fought all the
battles by themselves...

138
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:43,833
They have a bond now.

139
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,541
Wow...

140
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,125
According to the report
from the Operations Room,

141
00:08:48,208 --> 00:08:50,458
we will attack the
day after tomorrow.

142
00:08:50,541 --> 00:08:52,208
Please use today to rest up...

143
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:53,541
You're certainly going

144
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,958
to need all of your energy
for the coming battle.

145
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,041
Hold on...
Sergeant Miyafuji, Lynette,

146
00:08:58,125 --> 00:09:00,375
don't forget you two
have training after this.

147
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,458
Yes Ma'am...
We promise we'll be there.

148
00:09:06,166 --> 00:09:09,333
Oh gross... She's
completely indecent.

149
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,416
Who me?

150
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,916
She didn't mean that...

151
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,791
But you really shouldn't be
slurping your tea so loudly.

152
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,208
I still don't get it.

153
00:09:29,291 --> 00:09:33,041
What is it about that girl that
Major Sakamoto likes so much?

154
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,375
Alright, what do you want
me to do with it this time?

155
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:56,041
The same thing
you always do with it.

156
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,041
Nothing's different.

157
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,458
Are you sure?

158
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,041
I really think you should
keep some of it with you.

159
00:10:00,125 --> 00:10:02,500
The only thing I need with me
is food, clothing, and shelter,

160
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,916
and I have that.

161
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:08,958
Sergeant Miyafuji?

162
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:09,958
Yes ma'am?

163
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:11,958
Could you come
here for a minute?

164
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,166
I'm so confused, Lynne.

165
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:17,625
I just got my salary
from Commander Minna...

166
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,791
I didn't even think
they would be paying me...

167
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,125
I was so surprised.

168
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:25,250
Why am I not surprised
you're surprised?

169
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,250
The thing that I'm confused
about is the amount.

170
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,500
How much is a pound worth?

171
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,291
Well let's see,
Fuso's currency is um...

172
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,333
It's the yen.

173
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,583
Okay, well then that means

174
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,583
at the recent rate a
pound is kind of like--

175
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:39,666
One pound is equal
to 19.6 yen right now.

176
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,916
Oh!

177
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,625
Major Sakamoto!
We didn't know you were here!

178
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,416
I noticed.

179
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,625
We should work on that...

180
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,666
You two really need
to be more observant.

181
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,958
Yeah...

182
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,958
19.6 yen is worth
one bagful of rice,

183
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:54,791
which means ten pounds is...

184
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,875
That means ten pounds is
worth a thousand bowls of rice!

185
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:00,541
Oh, is that so Miyafuji...?

186
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:03,041
Then I suggest you
spend your money wisely.

187
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,791
By the way, you've only been
paid for half the month so far.

188
00:11:05,875 --> 00:11:07,208
Really, that was only half?

189
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,708
But major, why are
we getting paid so much?

190
00:11:09,791 --> 00:11:14,666
Simple... we are continuously
standing on the front lines...

191
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:16,458
Because of that, we never know

192
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,875
when a battle may be
the last one we fight...

193
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,416
Does that make sense?

194
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:22,250
Yeah, I think so.

195
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,791
They want to make sure
we have proper compensation.

196
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:28,000
That way we will have no
regrets in the line of fire.

197
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,250
Oh.

198
00:11:29,333 --> 00:11:31,291
They're in the same
bath tub together...?!

199
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,500
How encouraging...

200
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,666
If that's the whole
reason for this money,

201
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,916
then I don't think
I want to keep it.

202
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
I understand how you feel,
but I like the thought

203
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:48,208
of being able to send
something to my family.

204
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,458
You send it home?

205
00:11:49,541 --> 00:11:50,625
Yeah, I have a lot of siblings

206
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:52,708
and they always
appreciate the extra help.

207
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,333
That's such a
good idea, Lynne...!

208
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:56,500
I think I'm gonna send mine
to my mom and my grandma.

209
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:58,750
I bet they could really use it.

210
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,375
Yoshika Miyafuji...!

211
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:05,750
Can you please explain
how you got to be

212
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:07,875
such an insensitive
human being?!

213
00:12:07,958 --> 00:12:09,291
Huh?

214
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:12,250
I've had just about enough
of you, you beastly girl!

215
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:13,416
First you gave us

216
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:15,291
gross, disgusting
beans for breakfast...

217
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,875
Then you put a mop in my face...

218
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,833
You slurped
while drinking your tea!

219
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,208
And then you had the nerve
to take a bath with the Major!

220
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,833
You're like some rabid
raccoon-dog mixture!

221
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,333
Raccoon?

222
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:26,500
Dog mixture, yes!

223
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:27,666
And if you don't
want to be that,

224
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:29,375
then how about an
ugly, smelly mongrel?

225
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:30,833
Why are you so mean to me...?

226
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:31,916
There's no reason for you

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,541
to call me any of
those awful names!

228
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:36,166
Someone from your land shouldn't
be so chummy with the Major.

229
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,375
What are you talking about?

230
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:38,583
There's nothing wrong with it.

231
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:40,708
Sakamoto's from the
same country that I am!

232
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:42,291
Major Sakamoto...!

233
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,458
How many times do I have to tell
you that before it sinks in?!

234
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,291
She told me not to
call her Major, okay?!

235
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:47,958
So I'm not going to!

236
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,875
Alright, ladies, that's enough.

237
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,541
Fighting is
strictly prohibited...

238
00:12:53,625 --> 00:12:56,750
You know the rules so I'm gonna
have to punish both of you.

239
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,750
One week of toilet
cleaning should be enough.

240
00:13:01,833 --> 00:13:03,750
Are you gonna respond?

241
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:05,250
Yes ma'am.

242
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,708
That's more like it...
all right... dismissed.

243
00:13:09,500 --> 00:13:11,250
Dear Mom and Grandma...

244
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:14,916
I joined the Strike Witches,
but it's been really tough...

245
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:18,083
My friend Lynne is super
nice to me, but there are still

246
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,791
so many people here that
I can't really talk to yet.

247
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:26,708
I think... I just...
have to try...harder...

248
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:35,000
What's the matter...?

249
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:37,791
Why are you in the dark...?

250
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:38,791
Let me guess.

251
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,208
You're thinking
about your sister?

252
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,583
I hope you realize
it wasn't your fault.

253
00:13:44,666 --> 00:13:45,666
Course it was...

254
00:13:45,750 --> 00:13:47,000
If we had attacked
the Neuroi sooner

255
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:49,333
then Chris would never
have gotten involved...

256
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:52,625
And there's no way anyone could
ever change my mind about that.

257
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,875
Don't you forget we slowed
the enemy's advancement down

258
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:57,166
and bought time
for people to escape!

259
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,250
It doesn't matter.

260
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,125
The country wasn't protected!

261
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:03,041
You weren't the only
one responsible for that.

262
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,458
I'm sorry.

263
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,791
Wait a minute... you have
a lot of vacation days...

264
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,541
Why don't you take some
time off and go visit her?

265
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,666
I'm sure she'd like to see you.

266
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,375
She doesn't know me anymore...

267
00:14:14,458 --> 00:14:16,375
My life belongs to
the Strike Witches now.

268
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:17,958
Nothing else matters...

269
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:20,416
The sister Chris once
knew died that day...

270
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:23,333
Make sure you put me
on the next mission.

271
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:43,041
Today we will be focusing
on flight formation...

272
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,791
Lynne will be on my wing.

273
00:14:44,875 --> 00:14:45,875
Yes ma'am!

274
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:48,208
Barkhorn will be
working with Miyafuji.

275
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,958
Miyafuji. A response, please.

276
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,291
Yes Ma'am!

277
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:56,000
Wingmen, your only
responsibility today

278
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:59,041
is to follow your leader...
Should be easy enough.

279
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,541
If she changes direction,
you change direction...

280
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,833
If she tells you
to fire, you fire...

281
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:04,833
Yes Ma'am

282
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:05,958
Trust your leader.

283
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,583
She always has her
eye on the enemy...

284
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:10,000
She will give you specific
orders, so pay attention...

285
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,208
There's never any
reason to question her.

286
00:15:12,291 --> 00:15:13,750
Yes Ma'am

287
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,625
This duel-craft formation is
called a Rotte, and two Rottes

288
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:19,583
form a Schwarm--which
is also called a flight.

289
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,000
Yes ma'am!

290
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,208
During today's training session,
our unit will be evading

291
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:25,833
and Barkhorn's unit
will be pursuing us.

292
00:15:25,916 --> 00:15:28,208
Is something wrong, Barkhorn...?

293
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,750
Can't you hear me over there?

294
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:32,750
Everything's fine...
Let's get moving.

295
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:34,750
Okay, Lynne, follow me!

296
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,833
Alright, newbie...
Sure hope you're ready.

297
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,125
Right!

298
00:15:40,208 --> 00:15:42,416
That disgusting,
smelly, raccoon-mutt!

299
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,708
What's that?

300
00:15:47,041 --> 00:15:47,916
Incoming!

301
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:48,625
No way!

302
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:49,458
Oh no!

303
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,125
It can't be!

304
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,666
It's the Neuroi!

305
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,416
It's entered the east grid,
sector 7, altitude 15,000!

306
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:02,041
Their attack cycle has
been quite erratic recently.

307
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,750
I heard there was some
activity in Karlsland,

308
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:06,916
but I don't know all
the details just yet.

309
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,916
Did you say Karlsland?

310
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,041
Something wrong?

311
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:12,833
No ma'am...
There's nothing wrong.

312
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,791
Alright, prepare
to change formation.

313
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,791
Perrine will now
be Barkhorn's wingman.

314
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:18,875
Sergeant Miyafuji
will follow my lead.

315
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:21,083
Let's do this quick
and efficient.

316
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,875
Not again!

317
00:16:29,625 --> 00:16:30,708
Enemy sighted!

318
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,791
Barkhorn unit, move in!

319
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,291
Major, cover them!

320
00:16:35,375 --> 00:16:38,458
I'm right on it...
Miyafuji, follow me!

321
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,208
Right!

322
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:52,375
I can barely even
keep up with her...

323
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:56,500
She's flying
right next to her...

324
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,583
that rabid little mongrel!

325
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:00,875
Something is definitely wrong.

326
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:01,583
Wrong ma'am?

327
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,291
With Barkhorn, I mean...

328
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:05,000
She always keeps
her wingman very close

329
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:06,750
within her field of view.

330
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,041
But for some reason she's
trying to do it all herself.

331
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,458
Hold your aim right there!

332
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:15,333
Right!

333
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:23,000
Back up, Barkhorn...!
You're too close!

334
00:17:35,125 --> 00:17:36,375
Captain!

335
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:42,416
Captain Barkhorn!

336
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,250
Damn it all!

337
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,416
Oh, Captain!

338
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:55,458
This is all my fault...

339
00:17:55,541 --> 00:17:56,666
What am I gonna do?!

340
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:57,875
She's bleeding...

341
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,375
We can't move her...

342
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,083
It'll only make it worse.

343
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,125
I'm gonna have to heal her here.

344
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:06,833
That's okay...
Please, just save her.

345
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,083
stay calm, Yoshika...

346
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:16,875
You have to concentrate...
You can do this!

347
00:18:23,541 --> 00:18:25,541
Wow that's amazing...

348
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:30,583
Hold still,
I think it's working.

349
00:18:30,666 --> 00:18:31,708
What do you think you're doing?

350
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:32,875
You have to get away from me

351
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:34,916
or you'll put everyone
else in danger...!

352
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,583
Go on, get outta here...!

353
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,458
There is no point in saving me,
so just forget about it.

354
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,083
Use your powers on the enemy,

355
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,333
Hold on...!

356
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,875
I will save you...
We are friends, aren't we?

357
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,708
You're here to
defeat the enemy...

358
00:18:47,791 --> 00:18:51,083
It's my fate to die here.
I don't deserve to live.

359
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:54,458
That's not true!
You protect people.

360
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,333
If you're not around
then people will die!

361
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,583
I can't do it...

362
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:00,833
There's no way I can protect

363
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:03,375
all these people
you're talking about...

364
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:07,000
I couldn't--I couldn't
even save my sister...

365
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,375
Forget about me...
I'm useless...

366
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:11,791
Go!

367
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,416
I know it's impossible to
protect everyone Captain,

368
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,000
but I'm still gonna try...!

369
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:17,625
Because that's what
I came here to do.

370
00:19:17,708 --> 00:19:18,750
I'm not leaving!

371
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,916
I want to help as
many people as I can

372
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,500
and right now you need help!

373
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,583
Hurry...! I can't
fight it off much longer!

374
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,541
Almost done...

375
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:34,166
Just a little longer...
There...!

376
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,833
Chris...

377
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:49,125
I don't want to give up...
I have the power to help...

378
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,791
This time I will protect them!

379
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:53,833
The core!

380
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,583
Captain...

381
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,791
Minna!

382
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,083
What do you think
you're doing...?!

383
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,375
If we lose you, what
are we supposed to do...?!

384
00:20:34,458 --> 00:20:36,250
I understand that
you lost your homeland

385
00:20:36,333 --> 00:20:39,333
and that must be really, really
difficult, but we are a team,

386
00:20:39,416 --> 00:20:44,125
no, a family: you, me,
the entire squad!

387
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,250
Chris is going to get better.

388
00:20:47,333 --> 00:20:48,583
I promise you that...

389
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,833
So for her sake, and for
the sake of your friends,

390
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,916
don't take your
life for granted!

391
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,208
I don't know what
we'd do if you died!

392
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,916
We are the only ones
who can protect our country.

393
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,000
So stop being so
selfish and stay with us!

394
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,166
I'm sorry...

395
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:06,541
We are a family. You're right.

396
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,833
That vacation you mentioned...

397
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:12,458
I think I would like
to take it after all...

398
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:16,416
I'd like to go visit her.

399
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,500
So, I see you finally
decided to do it, huh?

400
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:27,666
Aw, I didn't even
get to do anything.

401
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,583
C'mon, that's not true.

402
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,333
Yes it is, Lynne, okay?

403
00:21:37,375 --> 00:21:39,875
Well, I suppose
I should thank you.

404
00:21:40,625 --> 00:21:44,208
I figured the least I could do
is express my gratitude.

405
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,875
Sergeant Miyafuji...

406
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,458
I heard all about
the way you saved Trudy!

407
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,666
Trudy?

408
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:52,791
Captain Barkhorn.

409
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,125
That's her first name.

410
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:55,541
Oh yeah...

411
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,250
Well I guess you could say
we saved each other, then.

412
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:58,125
Either way.

413
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:00,916
I just wanted to say thank you!

414
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,833
Oh look!
I think they're back!

415
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:18,541
Welcome back!

416
00:22:27,375 --> 00:22:29,375
Captain Barkhorn...!

417
00:22:29,458 --> 00:22:31,416
Your ride is here!

418
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:34,083
Alright, I'm coming!

419
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,083
Someday...

420
00:22:40,166 --> 00:22:42,458
I'll find a way to repay her.

421
00:22:50,125 --> 00:22:51,625
Thanks.

422
00:24:23,583 --> 00:24:24,708
Tadaa!

423
00:24:24,791 --> 00:24:26,083
What do you think of
my new bathing suit?!

424
00:24:26,166 --> 00:24:27,750
Great if you like showing
off how flat you are!

425
00:24:27,833 --> 00:24:29,875
At least I can see
the ground in front of me!

426
00:24:29,958 --> 00:24:31,458
Besides, I'm still growing!

427
00:24:31,541 --> 00:24:33,666
Next time on Strike Witches...

428
00:24:33,750 --> 00:24:34,333
Fast...!

429
00:24:34,416 --> 00:24:35,625
Big...!

430
00:24:35,708 --> 00:24:36,958
Soft...!
