1
00:02:27,041 --> 00:02:29,291
Your displeasure is
written all over your face,

2
00:02:29,375 --> 00:02:30,750
calm yourself Major.

3
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:32,333
They call us all
the way over there

4
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,916
and then start telling us how
the budget is totally fubard;

5
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,333
of course I'm pissed off.
They owe us!

6
00:02:37,416 --> 00:02:39,166
They're just panicking...

7
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:40,375
We're currently the only ones

8
00:02:40,458 --> 00:02:42,750
consistently getting
results at this point.

9
00:02:42,833 --> 00:02:44,458
They're not going
to see anything other

10
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,458
than what they want
until it's far too late.

11
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,041
That's just how the
warmongers behave.

12
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,791
If the Neuroi had
never shown up,

13
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,458
they would have you, me
and everyone on this team

14
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:56,375
split into sides and
killing each other instead.

15
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,083
Those damn bankers
think they run the world.

16
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:01,083
Sorry about that, Miyafuji...

17
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:02,916
I really wanted to
show around Britannia

18
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,416
so you could know how
beautiful her people can be.

19
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,625
It's okay...

20
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:08,500
I was actually just
thinking how everyone

21
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:12,208
in the military
is so different...

22
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:15,250
Umm... Do you hear something?

23
00:03:15,958 --> 00:03:18,375
That's just Sanya singing.

24
00:03:18,458 --> 00:03:20,041
We're approaching the base.

25
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,250
She came to escort us.

26
00:03:24,833 --> 00:03:26,416
Thanks, Sanya.

27
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,208
Is Sanya really shy?

28
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:33,958
She just flew away.

29
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,333
She may be a little shy

30
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,750
but she has a pretty voice
and she's a good girl.

31
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:40,833
Hold on.

32
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,333
What is it, Sanya?

33
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,958
Someone is looking at us.

34
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,000
Someone is what?

35
00:03:46,083 --> 00:03:47,250
Repeat that please.

36
00:03:47,333 --> 00:03:48,791
I'm having trouble
reading your transmission.

37
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:49,833
I'm sorry.

38
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:51,541
There is an unknown
bogey inbound

39
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,166
from the direction of
Sirius at high speed.

40
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:55,958
 So is it a Neuroi?

41
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,708
Yes, I believe it's them.

42
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:01,500
It's speed is too great
to be a normal aircraft.

43
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,083
I don't see anything Sanya...

44
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:04,583
It's in the clouds.

45
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,791
Target cannot be
acquired visually.

46
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,125
So that's how it is.

47
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:10,291
Um, Major, what are
we supposed to do?!

48
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:11,166
Nothing we can do.

49
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:12,416
We're trapped here.

50
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:13,666
Without our Striker Units

51
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,541
we're just regular
passengers on this plane.

52
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,250
Do you think they
planned it this way?

53
00:04:18,333 --> 00:04:21,625
The Neuroi aren't capable of
such complicated strategies.

54
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,833
Target is still inbound, fast.

55
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:25,791
Contact in three minutes.

56
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:29,333
Sanya... try to buy us
time until backup arrives...

57
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:31,625
Avoid a direct
engagement if possible.

58
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:32,958
Yes ma'am.

59
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,791
I'll draw their fire
away from the transport.

60
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,083
Don't do anything reckless.

61
00:04:37,166 --> 00:04:38,750
Watch closely, Miyafuji.

62
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,791
Okay.

63
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,583
Sanya can find Neuroi
even you can't see?

64
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:46,416
Yes. Her magical
abilities allow her

65
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,500
to see what lies beyond
even the horizon.

66
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:51,000
Wow...

67
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,416
That's why we always have
her assigned to night patrol...

68
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,833
It's where she makes sense.

69
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,583
It's no different than
your healing magic.

70
00:04:58,375 --> 00:04:59,791
You heard her song, right?

71
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:01,416
That's one of her spells.

72
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,208
She uses it to
guide the transport.

73
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:22,583
No return fire.

74
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,208
Just as I thought.

75
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,083
She's able to battle them
before their even visible.

76
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:31,666
I can't see any Neuroi at all.

77
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:34,166
You can take
Sanya's word for it.

78
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:35,791
Sanya, that's enough...

79
00:05:35,875 --> 00:05:37,666
Return to base.

80
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,125
But it's not... I...

81
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:41,250
Good work.

82
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,333
You were able to
protect us by yourself.

83
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:48,291
It's raining so hard...
I can't see a thing.

84
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:49,750
Wait, look over there.

85
00:05:51,333 --> 00:05:52,291
Sanya...

86
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,666
Hold on, Eila!
You can't go alone.

87
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,791
No. She'll be fine.

88
00:05:55,875 --> 00:05:58,583
Looks like it's all over.

89
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:07,208
So... Nobody actually saw
the Neuroi except Sanya?

90
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,333
It stayed hidden in the clouds

91
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,791
and never showed its face.

92
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,500
'kay... But
I heard it didn't

93
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,708
even bother trying to
shoot back at her...

94
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,750
When does a Neuroi do that?

95
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:20,333
Are we even certain
it really was a Neuroi?

96
00:06:21,666 --> 00:06:23,916
Maybe it was
a shy Neuroi...

97
00:06:24,833 --> 00:06:27,125
...or maybe not...

98
00:06:27,625 --> 00:06:28,833
Sorry.

99
00:06:28,916 --> 00:06:29,916
No, its true...

100
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,166
Maybe they were connecting

101
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,875
on the same wavelength
like sisters perhaps.

102
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,083
How a Neuroi 'thinks'
is not known...

103
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:38,958
We need a clearer
picture of their intentions...

104
00:06:39,041 --> 00:06:41,041
Until we have that
there is no way

105
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:43,625
to predict what
they will do next...

106
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:45,583
There is a high
likelihood this Neuroi

107
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:49,250
that failed will return over
and over again till it succeeds.

108
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:50,166
I agree.

109
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:51,375
Because of that very reason,

110
00:06:51,458 --> 00:06:52,708
I am going to set up

111
00:06:52,791 --> 00:06:55,083
a special unit specifically
for night missions.

112
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:55,875
Sanya.

113
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:56,750
Ma'am.

114
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:57,666
Miyafuji.

115
00:06:57,750 --> 00:06:59,208
Yeah.

116
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,708
Starting immediately...

117
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:03,541
The two of you will constitute
the new night combat team.

118
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,458
Are you really sure you want me?

119
00:07:05,541 --> 00:07:08,125
You're the only other one with
experience with this Neroi.

120
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:10,625
But... I only sat
there and watched.

121
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,833
I'd like to volunteer
for night combat.

122
00:07:12,916 --> 00:07:14,166
That's great...

123
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,041
So Eila makes three total
for the night patrol.

124
00:07:16,125 --> 00:07:20,833
Sorry... this is all because
I let the Neuroi get away.

125
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:24,208
No! Nobody said that Sanya...

126
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:29,583
Blueberries?

127
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,500
Why do we have so many... huh?

128
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,000
My uncle shipped
them here all the way

129
00:07:33,083 --> 00:07:34,708
from our farm back home...

130
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:37,666
Blueberries are supposed to be
really good for your eyesight.

131
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,250
Let's see.

132
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,583
Yes, it's true...

133
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:42,583
In Brittania all the night
pilots eat blueberries.

134
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:45,208
It's likely they discovered
their benefits as well.

135
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:48,291
Yoshika, Shirley!
Stick out your tongues!

136
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,875
Typical.

137
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:00,041
Perrine!

138
00:08:02,916 --> 00:08:04,708
Everything in moderation.

139
00:08:06,791 --> 00:08:09,125
How could you do
such a thing to me?

140
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,916
Delicious.

141
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,916
You've finished your breakfast.

142
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,333
That's good.

143
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,541
It's time for you
three to go to sleep.

144
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:20,958
Dismissed.

145
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,583
Huh?

146
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,375
But, we just woke up.

147
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,750
And did they really have to come

148
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,875
and cover up all
of the windows too?

149
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,500
They probably want us
to get used to the dark.

150
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:40,458
Sorry they turned you room
into such a dark cave Sanya.

151
00:08:40,541 --> 00:08:43,583
They didn't... This is
how I like my room.

152
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:45,833
Oh, really...

153
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:48,541
Hey... these are
some type of talisman.

154
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:49,875
Talisman?

155
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,000
Some people think
they're good luck charms

156
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:54,208
that scare away ghosts.

157
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:58,000
People sometimes
mistake me for a ghost.

158
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,583
Yeah...? Because you're
always flying around at night?

159
00:09:01,666 --> 00:09:04,583
Happens a lot during the day...

160
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:07,625
They say they can't tell
if I'm really there or not.

161
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:12,125
Don't pay attention to anything
Ms. Priss Four Eyes says.

162
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:14,125
If you're bored,
I've got Tarot cards.

163
00:09:14,208 --> 00:09:15,166
Tarot cards?

164
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:16,791
It's fortune telling...

165
00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:20,208
I can use my magic
to see into the future.

166
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:23,000
I can't see very far though.

167
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,958
Now let's see...

168
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:27,458
Well. This is good.

169
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:31,166
You're going to see someone
you've been longing to see.

170
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,333
Is that true...?

171
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,375
It's not...
That's not possible.

172
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:37,833
Why not?

173
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,458
Because that person
is not coming back.

174
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:42,416
I see...

175
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:45,208
I don't know what
to tell you then.

176
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:59,041
Time to wake up! It's night!

177
00:10:02,416 --> 00:10:04,333
It's dark in here.

178
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,791
They said it's to
help your eyes adjust

179
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,375
to flying during
nighttime missions.

180
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,250
What's this?

181
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:12,666
It's a special
marigold herbal tea...

182
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,000
I've heard it can
help your eyesight

183
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,041
just as much as blueberries.

184
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,791
Oh really, I heard that that
was just an old wives tale.

185
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:21,083
What! I've never met such an
insolent brat in all my life.

186
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,750
This secret recipe
is my grandmothers.

187
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,458
Oh... I'm sorry.

188
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,500
This smells like sansho.

189
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:29,500
Sansho?

190
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:30,541
Lynne and Yoshika...

191
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,375
Stick out your tongues.

192
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:37,750
This is so stupid!

193
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,291
Our tongues just look
like normal tongues!

194
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:40,833
She's got a point.

195
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:41,958
This isn't a contest!

196
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,666
I was just trying to be helpful!

197
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:46,583
Yuck

198
00:10:52,291 --> 00:10:54,541
My hands won't stop shaking.

199
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:55,625
Why?

200
00:10:55,708 --> 00:10:56,791
I didn't think the sky

201
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:59,166
would actually look
this black at night.

202
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:01,500
Is this your first
nighttime mission?

203
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,416
Do you want to scrub it?

204
00:11:05,375 --> 00:11:07,750
Will you both hold my hands?

205
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:11,750
I'm sure I can do it if
you hold my hand, Sanya.

206
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,875
Let's get going.

207
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,333
Wait... I have to... uh...

208
00:11:24,416 --> 00:11:26,541
I'm not ready yet.

209
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,875
Please don't let
go of my hands...

210
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,708
Promise you'll hang on to me!

211
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:35,416
Wait just another minute...

212
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,791
We're almost above the clouds.

213
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,000
It's beautiful!

214
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,000
I could never have made
it up here on my own.

215
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,208
Sanya. Eila. Thank you!

216
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:56,625
's okay... It's our job

217
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:15,125
What's this?

218
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,958
Liver oil... from a lamprey.

219
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,416
It's good for eyesight
and temperament.

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,541
It smells kinda fishy.

221
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:23,708
It's fish oil.

222
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:25,333
The nutritious benefits
should more than

223
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,416
outweigh the difficult flavor.

224
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,333
Are we back in
kindergarten Yoshika?

225
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,708
What an absurd choice.

226
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:34,416
Is that so...?
I'm the one who brought it.

227
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:36,583
I love fish oil!

228
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,708
Ewwww... What's this?

229
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:44,708
Tastes pretty similar
to engine lubricant.

230
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:46,875
I was forced to
drink this as a cadet

231
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,125
and I couldn't stand it either.

232
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,625
I couldn't agree with you more.

233
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:53,750
Another round.

234
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,125
Um... Eila and Sanya,

235
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,916
where are the two of
you from before all this?

236
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:03,166
I'm from Suomus.

237
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,750
Orussia.

238
00:13:04,833 --> 00:13:07,916
Oh... Where are those again?

239
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,333
Suomus is in the
Northern part of Europe...

240
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,166
Orussia is in the East.

241
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,375
Oh, right...

242
00:13:13,458 --> 00:13:15,041
Wasn't most of Europe destroyed

243
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:18,208
by the Neuroi in the
first round of attacks?

244
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:22,166
Yes... the city I lived
in fell a long time ago.

245
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,458
What happened to your family?

246
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,500
When the Neuroi
came they fled the city

247
00:13:26,583 --> 00:13:28,708
and took shelter further east...

248
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:33,208
much further east...
over the Ural mountains.

249
00:13:33,291 --> 00:13:35,375
Thank goodness for that.

250
00:13:35,458 --> 00:13:37,250
What's so good about that?

251
00:13:37,333 --> 00:13:39,375
Don't you hear
what she's telling you?

252
00:13:39,458 --> 00:13:40,833
Well, they may be
far apart right now

253
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:44,750
but at least they can get
back together someday.

254
00:13:45,375 --> 00:13:46,916
Orussia is a huge place.

255
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:50,416
Past the Urals its dozens
of times the size of Fuso.

256
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,083
It's not so easy to find
people once you've lost them.

257
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:58,208
Besides, there's a Neuroi
hive between here and there.

258
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:02,916
I see what you mean, but
I'm still a little jealous.

259
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:05,708
You're kinda
stubborn aren't you?

260
00:14:05,791 --> 00:14:07,000
You don't understand.

261
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:08,291
What I mean is:

262
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,958
You want to see your
family again, right Sanya?

263
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,166
Yes.

264
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,916
Well, I'll bet they
wake up every morning,

265
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,416
just like you, thinking
and wondering about the day

266
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,833
when you'll all be
reunited as a family.

267
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,041
Yes.

268
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:22,000
If neither of you ever gives up,

269
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:24,625
then someday you'll have
to be together again...

270
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:28,333
It must be so wonderful to
be able to think that way.

271
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,500
I feel so yucky.

272
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:35,250
Then why don't
we go to the sauna?

273
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,500
Sauna?

274
00:14:36,583 --> 00:14:39,333
C'mon... you've never
been to a sauna before?

275
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:43,958
Um. Eila This is
getting really boring.

276
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:47,500
In Suomus we like
saunas more than baths.

277
00:14:47,583 --> 00:14:50,250
Sanya, your skin is so white.

278
00:14:51,125 --> 00:14:52,583
Hey, what are you looking at?

279
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:56,000
Nothing. She just
has really pretty skin.

280
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,333
Stop looking at Sanya like that!

281
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,666
It's right over here.

282
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,166
You sure this is okay?

283
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:08,875
Bathing after a sauna is a must.

284
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,833
The water's nice and cold but...

285
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:14,000
Calm down. It's just
us girls out here.

286
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,875
It's not that... I-

287
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,625
When I hear her...

288
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:29,291
...her song...
it makes my heart ache.

289
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:30,958
Yeah.

290
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,708
I'm sorry.

291
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:36,375
What are you apologizing for?

292
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:37,416
Well...

293
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,666
We didn't mean
to interrupt you...

294
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,000
That song. It's so beautiful.

295
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,000
My father.

296
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,083
He wrote that song
for me a long time ago

297
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:48,083
when I was a little girl.

298
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,000
Your father?

299
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:54,416
One day many years ago,
when I was little,

300
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:57,458
I was stuck inside
because of the rain.

301
00:15:57,541 --> 00:15:59,875
I was counting
raindrops out of boredom

302
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,625
and my father turned
it into a song for me.

303
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,666
Sanya went on to
study music in Vienna

304
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,791
at her father's recommendation.

305
00:16:10,875 --> 00:16:13,333
Sounds like a wonderful man.

306
00:16:13,416 --> 00:16:16,375
Your father was a
wonderful man too, Miyafuji.

307
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:17,166
Huh?

308
00:16:17,250 --> 00:16:18,375
Why's that?

309
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,666
That's easy, because
Dr. Miyafuji was the one

310
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:23,333
who invented the Striker
Unit that you wear...

311
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:26,208
That's a special
connection between you.

312
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,291
That's true.

313
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,833
But its not really
the typical present

314
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:31,708
a father gets for
his little girl.

315
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,625
Don't be so picky...

316
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:35,958
Those units are expensive.

317
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,791
Hey, guess what?

318
00:16:47,875 --> 00:16:50,958
You'll never guess...
but today is my birthday.

319
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,458
Why didn't you tell us it was?

320
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:54,791
I usually ignore it

321
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:57,666
because its also the
day that my father died.

322
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,416
It's a long story and I didn't
want to explain it to everyone.

323
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:03,250
Well, that's
just plain stupid...

324
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:04,458
If it's your birthday

325
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,041
then we're obligated
to have some fun, right?

326
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,541
Are you sure about that?

327
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,708
Of course.

328
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,708
Miyafuji.

329
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,458
I want you to listen closely.

330
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:21,125
Okay.

331
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,250
Hey... I can
hear something.

332
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:25,041
It's the radio.

333
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:29,375
At night... the sky is quiet,
so I can pick up radio waves

334
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:32,083
from distant places
over the horizon.

335
00:17:32,166 --> 00:17:33,458
That's amazing!

336
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:35,625
I had no idea you could do that!

337
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:38,666
Yes. It keeps me company
when I'm flying at night.

338
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,666
I thought this
was our little secret.

339
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:45,958
I'm sorry... but tonight
is a special occasion.

340
00:17:46,375 --> 00:17:48,500
It's your magic.
Do what you want.

341
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:49,500
What's wrong?

342
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,791
You'll see.

343
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:53,416
Tonight just also
happens to be...

344
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:56,708
What?

345
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,583
What is it?

346
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,791
It's a song.

347
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:03,208
But how could...?

348
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:09,166
Is this the Neuroi's voice?

349
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:11,625
It's mimicking
Sanya's frequency...

350
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:12,916
Where is she?!

351
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,250
According to the schedule,
she's in the middle

352
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,500
of a night training
mission with Sgt. Miyafuji.

353
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:17,875
Call them back now!

354
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,416
We can't... The song
is blocking our signal.

355
00:18:20,500 --> 00:18:23,125
Dammit! They're after Sanya.

356
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:27,291
It sounds... like...

357
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:28,916
Is it the Neuroi, Sanya?

358
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,250
The Neuroi? Where?

359
00:18:30,333 --> 00:18:32,458
You need to leave right now.

360
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,375
Sanya

361
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,708
You idiot! Why fight him alone?

362
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,833
The enemy is after me...

363
00:18:51,916 --> 00:18:55,458
I can feel it.
You have get away from me.

364
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:56,875
If you're here...

365
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:58,583
C'mon... what are
you talking about?

366
00:18:58,666 --> 00:19:00,625
We could never do that.

367
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,500
Please go...

368
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:05,250
You can't see it.

369
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,500
Sanya is going to tell me
where that Neuroi is hiding.

370
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,000
After that...

371
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,625
I'll be able to predict the
enemy's movements short term

372
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,791
with my magic, so I'll be fine.

373
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,750
You are not the same
as that thing Sanya.

374
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,041
It may be alone
but you've got us.

375
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:23,041
Together we can't be defeated.

376
00:19:28,875 --> 00:19:30,666
Neuroi inbound
from an intersect line

377
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,125
2 degrees off Vega and Altair...

378
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:36,000
Distance to target
thirty two hundred meters.

379
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,333
Here?

380
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,333
It's accelerating.

381
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:39,666
A little more lead...

382
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:42,583
That's good... Three seconds.

383
00:19:42,666 --> 00:19:44,250
Take this!

384
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:57,500
Did I miss?

385
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,000
No, it's decelerating.

386
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:01,416
It's sustained heavy damage.

387
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:02,583
It's coming back.

388
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:05,125
Oh no you don't!

389
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:07,791
It dodged it!

390
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,625
Damn it! Show yourself.

391
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,958
It's there!

392
00:20:16,791 --> 00:20:17,458
Eila stop!

393
00:20:17,541 --> 00:20:18,291
Get out of here!

394
00:20:18,375 --> 00:20:21,875
There's no time!

395
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,125
Good thinking Miyafuji.

396
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,208
I've got this...

397
00:20:26,291 --> 00:20:27,875
We're not going
to lose to that thing.

398
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:30,416
Cause we're a team!

399
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,125
I can still hear it.

400
00:20:57,208 --> 00:20:57,833
Why?

401
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,541
Didn't we destroy it?

402
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,708
No... that's my father's piano.

403
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,000
I see... The radio!

404
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,708
It's reaching to us from
somewhere down there...

405
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,750
Wherever he is...
it's a miracle!

406
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,208
To be expected, really.

407
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,416
Huh?

408
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:17,458
After all, it is Sanya's
birthday today, too.

409
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:20,041
Technically, yesterday...
but you know.

410
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,875
It's the same day as mine.

411
00:21:21,958 --> 00:21:23,000
What better way for a father

412
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:24,708
to celebrate his
daughter's birthday,

413
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,875
than to play the song
he wrote for her...

414
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,708
That kind of love allows
for moments like this,

415
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,083
for those who are
open to feel it...

416
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:34,083
It's no miracle.

417
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,416
Eila... You're so nice.

418
00:21:36,500 --> 00:21:38,500
No I am not... idiot.

419
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,291
Idiot?

420
00:21:40,375 --> 00:21:42,541
Oh mother... Oh father...

421
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:47,833
Your daughter is
listening... I'm right here.

422
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,416
A Happy birthday...
right, Sanya?

423
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,916
You too.

424
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:02,083
I hope you had a Happy
birthday... Miyafuji.

425
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,125
Happy birthday.

426
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:07,000
Thank you both.

427
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:17,208
The Neuroi had its
sights on Sanya this time.

428
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:20,458
It even adapted to her
actions... mimicking them.

429
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,208
It's quite obvious
that we are going to

430
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:25,750
have start rethinking the way we
approach combat with the Neuroi.

431
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,166
Do you think Command
is aware of any of this?

432
00:22:28,250 --> 00:22:31,083
I don't know...

433
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:34,791
It's possible they could
know even more than we do.

434
00:22:35,791 --> 00:22:38,958
We can't let our
guard down for a second.

435
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,916
Yoshika's a little twerp
who can get on your nerves.

436
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
Shirley's a giant pumpkin
with some super curves.

437
00:24:30,083 --> 00:24:33,083
Lynne is the super ace at
least that's what I think.

438
00:24:33,166 --> 00:24:36,416
Barkhorn's the pretty one
and I'm the one who stinks!
