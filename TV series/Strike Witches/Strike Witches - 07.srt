1
00:03:32,125 --> 00:03:33,791
I overslept.

2
00:03:33,875 --> 00:03:35,666
I'm late! I'm late!

3
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:39,000
My glasses! My glasses.

4
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:44,916
One, two, three, four,
two, two, three, four...

5
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,916
Shirley... Good morning.

6
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,583
I'm sorry!

7
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:03,958
What the hell?!

8
00:04:04,041 --> 00:04:07,166
Uh, Sanya...

9
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,333
That's weird...

10
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,875
How did she end up
in the wrong bedroom?

11
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,666
Well... I guess just for today.

12
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,250
Oh great...

13
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,416
So long as she doesn't
go making it a habit.

14
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,541
It's morning! Wake up, Hartmann.

15
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:50,291
Just five more minutes,
mom... maybe seventy.

16
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:51,625
I don't think so.

17
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,708
Okay, forty.

18
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:56,250
Get up!

19
00:04:58,666 --> 00:05:01,458
For a soldier of Karlsland,
discipline, first.

20
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:04,166
Second, discipline. Third
fourth, fifth is discipline!

21
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,500
Discpline is sixth,
seventh, eighth and ninth!

22
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,375
Discipline.

23
00:05:08,458 --> 00:05:10,041
And tenth?

24
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,416
Do you know what today is?

25
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,583
Hartmann.

26
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:17,291
Sleep day?

27
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:21,250
No...! Your commendation
is this afternoon.

28
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:24,208
In recognition of your
250 kills and service in combat

29
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,833
you are being awarded
the Knights Cross,

30
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:27,583
with Oak, Leaves, and Swords.

31
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:29,666
Commander Minna
told you last night.

32
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:35,625
Can I trade my award for sleep?

33
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,291
You can't! Now get up!

34
00:05:45,208 --> 00:05:46,583
Put on some panties- Pants!

35
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:47,541
I mean clothes.

36
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,625
Just cover yourself already!

37
00:05:56,375 --> 00:05:59,791
You left this prestigious
medal on the floor?

38
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,125
And you dare to call
yourself a soldier of Karlsland.

39
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:06,583
It's time for breakfast...

40
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:09,208
Finish dressing and
meet me in the dining hall.

41
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,125
What...?

42
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,416
They're gone.

43
00:06:32,291 --> 00:06:33,875
Put your hips into it.

44
00:06:33,958 --> 00:06:35,041
Yes, ma'am!

45
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:37,791
More strength in your top hand

46
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,500
Yes ma'am.

47
00:06:38,583 --> 00:06:40,041
Body and mind are one...

48
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:42,416
It is not the sword
that defeats the enemy...

49
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:44,125
Understand Miyafuji?

50
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:46,125
Not really!

51
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,000
Is that so?

52
00:06:48,083 --> 00:06:49,625
One hundred more swings.

53
00:06:49,708 --> 00:06:51,583
One hundred more swings.

54
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,416
Major, you're so close to her.

55
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,833
Please don't...
I need sword practice, too.

56
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,333
Shouldn't I get special
training sessions with you?

57
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:02,791
Why does she get
your undivided attention

58
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:06,125
every morning,
filthy raccoon dog runt.

59
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,166
Hey.

60
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,916
So what are you
looking at Perrine?

61
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,250
Hey, look its
Francesca and Perrine...

62
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,416
Whatcha doin?

63
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,208
I spent all night
up in this tree.

64
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:18,875
I... uh... hello.

65
00:07:20,083 --> 00:07:21,875
Miyafuji... get back to work.

66
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:24,166
Oh, right!

67
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:26,083
Uhhh... me too?

68
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:29,166
Well... Good idea...! Yes...

69
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,333
You need the training.

70
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,875
Yes!

71
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,708
Lucchini, you too!

72
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,791
Harder! You must train harder!

73
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,291
They're all out
training again...

74
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:47,750
Major Sakamoto...
She's so very inspiring...

75
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:50,125
I just hope that
she's not panicking.

76
00:07:51,666 --> 00:07:53,166
No... I'm sorry...

77
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,583
This will be good...

78
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:55,875
Glad you volunteered.

79
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,875
We needed a guide
familiar with the area...

80
00:07:57,958 --> 00:08:01,541
This is a very important
delivery we're picking up.

81
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:03,958
I'm happy I could
be of use to you.

82
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,208
No one else is coming down.

83
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,125
Typical...

84
00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:19,458
We're the only disciplined ones.

85
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,708
Well... the Neuroi
won't be attacking today...

86
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,625
It's okay.

87
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,333
You're far too
optimistic, Yankee...

88
00:08:28,416 --> 00:08:30,916
Always be prepared... Right?

89
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:34,666
So says the Karlsland
girl who can't relax.

90
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,666
I was saving that big one.

91
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,250
Blitzkrieg.

92
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,666
My pants... gone...

93
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:56,708
Oh well...

94
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,083
Last one in is a rotten egg...

95
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:08,833
That'll be you, stinky.

96
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,958
Nothing beats a
good soak after training.

97
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:16,125
Y-yes... You're so right.

98
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:29,416
Major.

99
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:35,708
Major?

100
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:54,916
It's so steamy I can't-

101
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:06,791
Stupid girls...! Who left
that bar of soap on the floor?

102
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:08,875
Um are you alright?

103
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,166
I just...

104
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,000
I'm... touching...
can't think... I'm so sorry.

105
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,250
Um ... Is it all right
if I sit with you?

106
00:10:21,333 --> 00:10:22,416
Sure...

107
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,000
Don't be concerned
about rank in the bath.

108
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,500
I'm really sorry, Perrine, 'kay?

109
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,416
The soap just slipped
right out of my hand.

110
00:10:31,500 --> 00:10:34,166
What kind of stupid
orphan raccoon dog...

111
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:35,750
You could've, killed me...

112
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:38,458
I mean... thanks so much.

113
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:51,250
It's a little breezy... Hey.

114
00:11:08,791 --> 00:11:11,000
Hey!

115
00:11:11,083 --> 00:11:13,250
Where are my panties...?

116
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,208
No fair.

117
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,583
Oh no, oh no... this is bad.

118
00:11:28,666 --> 00:11:32,166
Oh my... they're gone...!
Now hold on...

119
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,375
It's not a big deal...

120
00:11:34,458 --> 00:11:35,916
Perrine Clostermann...

121
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,833
Remember to remain calm...

122
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,708
A noble lady of Gallia
must retain her composure

123
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,541
at a time like this.

124
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,083
That's right...

125
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,333
Who cares if
I have no underwear?

126
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:56,708
It just feels
so uncomfortable...

127
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,708
If I could replace mine...

128
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,666
Those are... the Major's!

129
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:06,000
But... I can't touch
them without asking...

130
00:12:06,083 --> 00:12:08,875
 I... must be mentally insane.

131
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,875
I hear them calling out to me...

132
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:13,208
Yes... of course... why not...

133
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,000
You can just try them on...

134
00:12:15,083 --> 00:12:16,833
No...! You must
control yourself...

135
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:18,375
To be caught would be horrible.

136
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:20,000
Horrible!

137
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,208
I was just...

138
00:12:24,291 --> 00:12:26,541
What are you doing Perrine?

139
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:30,333
Uhh... Those are mine.

140
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,000
Someone's... been
stealing panties.

141
00:12:43,833 --> 00:12:45,458
It sure is a lovely day.

142
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:49,083
Indeed... it's
very peaceful here.

143
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:17,750
A crime... That's for certain.

144
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:21,541
Can I... have my clothes?

145
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:24,666
No... This is being
kept as evidence.

146
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,958
But...?

147
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:30,000
You're not wearing anything...?

148
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,083
Then I'll let you borrow mine.

149
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:34,625
Wait, no! I'll be fine!

150
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:36,250
No need to be shy.

151
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:37,583
Yes there is, please!

152
00:13:37,666 --> 00:13:38,958
Here take my coat...

153
00:13:39,041 --> 00:13:41,041
This should make it better.

154
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:44,583
Sakamoto... thank you very much!

155
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:56,291
What turned you into such
a prude...? Strange girl.

156
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:58,833
Let's start the investigation...

157
00:13:58,916 --> 00:14:01,916
Now who could possibly want
to steal Perrine's underwear?

158
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,291
Maybe she wasn't
wearing any to begin with.

159
00:14:04,375 --> 00:14:05,208
That's absurd.

160
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:06,750
Of course I was!

161
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,333
We have to assume that
someone has stolen them.

162
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,875
Now... given that...

163
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:20,291
We need to know who
preceded Officer Clostermann

164
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,000
in the locker room.

165
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:34,791
It was Ensign
Francesca Lucchini!

166
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:37,541
Get her!

167
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,416
Those panties are mine!

168
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,083
Wait! Stop!

169
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:57,875
Wait...! Don't take that!

170
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:01,833
Come back here!

171
00:15:02,250 --> 00:15:03,541
I'm sorry!

172
00:15:03,625 --> 00:15:04,750
Lucchini! Wait!

173
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:05,291
Stop!

174
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,166
Slow down.

175
00:15:06,250 --> 00:15:07,916
You're just making things worse!

176
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,750
Delicious!

177
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:17,833
Which way?

178
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,833
I dunno.

179
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,500
Let's go.

180
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:22,750
We'll go that way!

181
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,708
Right!

182
00:15:24,791 --> 00:15:27,291
Hey! Lucchini!

183
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,083
No... It rubs...

184
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,541
I can't... without...

185
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,666
Your mine!

186
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:48,125
No, I'm not.

187
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,208
Francesca... Just give 'em back!

188
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,375
Come on, please.

189
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:55,958
But why...? You should
come and get them.

190
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,625
Yoshika... I can see you!

191
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:16,916
Yoshika!

192
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,083
There she is! Stop!

193
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:21,625
This is stupid!

194
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:35,041
Don't run!

195
00:16:35,125 --> 00:16:37,083
Eila. Shh!

196
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,958
Oh Please, oh please, oh please.

197
00:16:46,166 --> 00:16:47,666
Perfect!

198
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,583
Hey, wait... I need those!

199
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,333
Crap!

200
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:24,625
Where is she?

201
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:25,875
She climbed down.

202
00:17:25,958 --> 00:17:27,250
Go.

203
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,291
Ta-da!

204
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,041
We've got her now!

205
00:17:36,125 --> 00:17:38,208
Justice approaches, you thief.

206
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:39,708
Nowhere to run!

207
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:41,125
Give it up!

208
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:46,416
I'm not a thief!

209
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,833
She's... too... fast!

210
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,458
This is-

211
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,125
The alarm?

212
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,125
It's the Neuroi.

213
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,375
Battle stations.

214
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:19,833
Right!

215
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,666
'kay, Let's go!

216
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,583
An attack!

217
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:37,875
Our battle predictions
are completely unreliable...

218
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,041
Better hurry.

219
00:18:52,458 --> 00:18:53,750
I feel so weird...

220
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,916
It just isn't the same fit.

221
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,458
Uh... Sakamoto...

222
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:58,875
I'm kinda exposed.

223
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,583
And I'm not wearing
anything either.

224
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:04,541
I don't care...

225
00:19:04,625 --> 00:19:06,208
This is combat girls...!

226
00:19:06,291 --> 00:19:08,750
No one cares about your panties.

227
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,291
I'll go too.

228
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,958
Sanya!

229
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:22,833
Hey, Eila... you're
wearing my tights.

230
00:19:30,583 --> 00:19:32,750
They're going to
be so mad at me...

231
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,208
I didn't mean to hit the switch.

232
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,291
What switch would that be?

233
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:46,333
No switch... I didn't... not me 

234
00:19:47,458 --> 00:19:49,333
I can't take them off right now!

235
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,958
But those are mine, Eila.

236
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,416
But Major...

237
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,291
It's breezy.

238
00:19:56,375 --> 00:19:57,666
Just deal with it!

239
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,041
Yes ma'am.

240
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,916
Why are you wasting
all this time?

241
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,208
Let's move out... All units!

242
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:05,083
Ohhh, right.

243
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:06,625
Everyone stop...

244
00:20:06,708 --> 00:20:08,208
Commander Minna?!!

245
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,541
Commander, the enemy...

246
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,333
Is not here...

247
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:13,125
It was a false alarm.

248
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:15,125
Huh?

249
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,708
You can come out, now.

250
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:19,166
Lucchini!

251
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,625
Francesca!

252
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:25,916
Lucchini accidentally set off
the alarm when she was hiding.

253
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:32,666
Also... I've confiscated these.

254
00:20:33,833 --> 00:20:35,166
There they are.

255
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:36,375
That's a relief.

256
00:20:36,458 --> 00:20:38,750
Excellent work there,
Commander Minna.

257
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:40,166
Not me...

258
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,583
all of the credit here has
to go Lieutenant Hartmann.

259
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,250
Amidst all the confusion,

260
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:46,125
she was the one who
retained her composure

261
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,583
and apprehended
the guilty party.

262
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:49,916
Thank you, ma'am.

263
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,375
Hartmann, I'm so proud of you.

264
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:54,708
You're the Karlsland
military's finest.

265
00:20:54,791 --> 00:20:58,250
Good job, officer.

266
00:20:58,333 --> 00:20:59,500
Wow! Amazing!

267
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:00,666
Well...

268
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,416
It's time to begin
the awards ceremony...

269
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:05,125
That is, of course, if you're
ready...? Lieutenant Hartmann.

270
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:06,583
Yes, Ma'am.

271
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:24,125
Lieutenant Hartmann!

272
00:21:24,208 --> 00:21:25,333
Front and Center.

273
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:26,958
Ma'am.

274
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,500
It's breezy.

275
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,750
Poor Lucchini...
She's cold...

276
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:43,916
Yeah... but something
doesn't add up.

277
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,208
That's right...

278
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:47,291
I never would have
taken them if I had mine...

279
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:49,666
My underwear... was stolen.

280
00:21:49,750 --> 00:21:50,333
What?

281
00:21:50,416 --> 00:21:51,750
Really?

282
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,125
Oh no... there's still a thief
running around the base?

283
00:21:54,208 --> 00:21:56,458
But... who would
steal someone's panties?

284
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:59,041
She's just trying
to make excuses.

285
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,916
We will now be presenting
one of our highest honors.

286
00:22:06,250 --> 00:22:08,250
Lieutenant Hartman,
in recognition

287
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,375
of your distinguished service
in the field of combat,

288
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:14,958
it is my honor to bestow
the Knight's Cross

289
00:22:15,041 --> 00:22:17,541
with Oak Leaves and Swords.

290
00:22:32,375 --> 00:22:34,833
Their just
absolutely speechless.

291
00:22:34,916 --> 00:22:36,500
Right.

292
00:22:42,625 --> 00:22:44,875
Congratulations,
Lieutenant Hartmann.

293
00:22:44,958 --> 00:22:47,875
Thank you very much.

294
00:24:24,166 --> 00:24:26,625
Maintaining morale means
maintaining discipline,

295
00:24:26,708 --> 00:24:29,041
no matter how
unreasonable it may seem...

296
00:24:29,125 --> 00:24:31,208
But these girls
are all free spirits

297
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:33,208
just like I was at their age.

298
00:24:33,291 --> 00:24:36,833
Next time on Strike Witches:
"I Won't Forget You."
