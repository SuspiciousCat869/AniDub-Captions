1
00:00:29,291 --> 00:00:31,041
It seems the
reinforcements and supplies

2
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,916
arrived from Fuso safely.

3
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,083
Yes sir.

4
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:35,500
Major Sakamoto and a
supplementary member

5
00:00:35,583 --> 00:00:37,625
named Yoshika
Miyafuji have arrived.

6
00:00:37,708 --> 00:00:40,375
As usual, we will be
treating her as a sergeant.

7
00:00:40,458 --> 00:00:43,333
We're certainly thankful
for the increased manpower.

8
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,875
Especially after hearing
that the Neuroi attacks

9
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,750
are becoming
much more irregular.

10
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:49,083
It's true, sir.

11
00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,541
Their intervals seem
to be gradually narrowing

12
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,291
from their usual weekly pattern.

13
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,916
Increasing our
numbers should help.

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,041
I doubt we'll be able to
leave things as they are...

15
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:58,458
With all due respect,

16
00:00:58,541 --> 00:01:01,875
I refuse to have armchair
theories imposed upon us.

17
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:08,291
All we're asking
for here is results.

18
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:09,916
And you will have them sir...

19
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,375
Rest assured that Brittania's
skies-along with the rest

20
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,666
of the world's-will be
protected by the Strike Witches.

21
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,208
Oh... that's right...

22
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:15,291
I joined the Strike Witches.

23
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,166
Sergeant Miyafugi...

24
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:36,250
How are you today...?

25
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,750
Did you sleep well?

26
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:39,125
Yes...!

27
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:41,625
Uh... Major Sakamoto,

28
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:44,041
do you always train
this early in the morning?

29
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:46,291
Of course.

30
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,541
And we're both
in the Navy now...

31
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:49,208
You don't have
to call me "Major."

32
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:53,291
Yes ma'am...!! Sakamoto, then?

33
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,166
That's better...

34
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,583
This is the front line.

35
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:59,000
We must always be
prepared for an enemy attack

36
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:01,375
and train as
often as possible...

37
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:03,791
It's the key to our survival.

38
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:06,375
The front line?

39
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,458
Oh come on, don't give
me that scared look...

40
00:04:09,541 --> 00:04:11,416
You definitely have
what it takes...

41
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,916
Our training
together will ensure

42
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,083
that you are ready for anything.

43
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,958
I'm counting on you!

44
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:23,041
And you can count on me.

45
00:04:28,708 --> 00:04:29,958
Who does she think she is?

46
00:04:30,041 --> 00:04:32,958
She's getting closer
to the Major every day...

47
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,833
That is not okay!

48
00:04:45,458 --> 00:04:46,791
Your attention, please.

49
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,916
Good morning...

50
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,125
Quick announcement...

51
00:04:49,208 --> 00:04:50,708
In case you haven't
gotten to meet her yet,

52
00:04:50,791 --> 00:04:52,375
this is our new recruit.

53
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:55,583
Major Sakamoto brought her
to us from the Fuso Empire...

54
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,166
This is Yoshika Miyafuji.

55
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:59,166
Thank you for having me...

56
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,833
I've been looking forward
to meeting all of you.

57
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,583
Miyafuji's rank is Sergeant.

58
00:05:03,666 --> 00:05:04,875
The same rank as you, Lynne,

59
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,083
so would you mind
getting her settled in?

60
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:09,375
Okay.

61
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:10,625
Good.

62
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,083
Now, all the documents,
clothing, rank insignia,

63
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,500
and identification
you need are in here.

64
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:20,000
Excuse me...?

65
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:22,125
Yes?

66
00:05:22,208 --> 00:05:25,041
I um... I won't
be needing a gun.

67
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:26,291
Well, I hope not,

68
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,375
but you should keep it
with you in case you do.

69
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:30,166
Sorry, no thank you.

70
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,666
Right...

71
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:35,166
She fascinates me.

72
00:05:37,125 --> 00:05:38,208
I don't get it...

73
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,666
What do you think of her?

74
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:41,375
Huh?

75
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,083
That's... It!

76
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:50,416
Well, I certainly wasn't
expecting that to happen...

77
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,291
I guess individual introductions
will have to wait 'til later...

78
00:05:53,375 --> 00:05:55,333
You are now dismissed!

79
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,041
So?

80
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:08,416
Consolation prize.

81
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,791
Lynne's are so much bigger.

82
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,625
You could never
compete with this.

83
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,166
Hi there, my name's
Charlotte Yeager...

84
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:25,083
I'm a Flight Lieutenant from
the United States of Liberion...

85
00:06:25,166 --> 00:06:26,791
But you can call me Shirley.

86
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:28,125
Hi...

87
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,208
You need to eat more if
you expect to get bigger.

88
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,291
I'm so bored.

89
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:39,166
I'm Eila Ilmatar Juutilainen...

90
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,333
Suomus Air Force ensign...

91
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:45,000
This is Sanya Litvyak,
an Orussia Army lieutenant.

92
00:06:45,083 --> 00:06:46,541
Francesca Lucchini.

93
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:48,416
Romagna Regia
Aeronautica ensign.

94
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,833
I'm please to meet all of you!

95
00:06:50,916 --> 00:06:53,000
Alright, that's enough
of the introductions...

96
00:06:53,083 --> 00:06:54,458
Time to get ready for duty...

97
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,416
Lynne and Miyafuji will
begin training this afternoon.

98
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,041
Ma'am!

99
00:06:59,125 --> 00:07:00,333
Excellent response 

100
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:01,500
Lynnette...

101
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,625
Begin by showing
Miyafuji around the base.

102
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:05,625
Yes ma'am, okay.

103
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,625
I'm Yoshika Miyafuji.

104
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,458
Thank you so much
for helping me.

105
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,541
It's my pleasure.

106
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,333
My name's Lynnette Bishop.

107
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,458
So have you memorized the room
locations, Sergeant Miyafuji?

108
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:21,833
Yeah... Pretty much.

109
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,750
Well, this one's my room.

110
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,125
Here...? No way!

111
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,291
That means we're neighbors!

112
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,083
Oh, is that so?

113
00:07:31,666 --> 00:07:32,958
It looks empty.

114
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:35,958
Yeah... That's because
I don't have anything yet.

115
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:37,833
I know a good place
to go for furniture

116
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:40,625
and other things you might
need--it's kinda far, but...

117
00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:43,166
I'd be happy to take you
if you want to go sometime?

118
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,875
Wow...! Thank you...!

119
00:07:44,958 --> 00:07:46,166
Do you think this place

120
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,708
will have a really
big pot that I can buy...?

121
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,125
Ya'know, For cooking.

122
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:52,166
Sure... but...
is that all you want?

123
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:55,458
And this is the
kitchen and dining hall.

124
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,125
Who gets to be on cooking duty?

125
00:07:58,208 --> 00:08:00,083
We have someone
who does it regularly,

126
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:01,375
but every once in a while,

127
00:08:01,458 --> 00:08:03,458
we let everyone make
their own ethnic cuisines.

128
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,791
Wow...

129
00:08:04,875 --> 00:08:07,000
I could make some really
great stuff with all this.

130
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,416
So I guess you're a
pretty good cook, huh?

131
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,958
I wouldn't say I'm good,

132
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:13,875
but I like cooking and I like
when people eat what I make.

133
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:33,916
Who's that?

134
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,166
That's Lieutenant Hartmann...

135
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,250
Her shoot-down count
reached two hundred recently.

136
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,000
Two hundred...?!

137
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,666
Wow, so I guess you
guys have been fighting

138
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,416
the Neuroi for a long time?

139
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:49,875
Captain Barkhorn--next to her--
shot down two hundred and fifty.

140
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,000
And Commander Minna's count
is over one hundred and sixty...

141
00:08:53,083 --> 00:08:54,833
Without the three of them,
this place would've been

142
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:57,541
conquered by the
Neuroi a long time ago.

143
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,458
That's incredible!

144
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,000
On top of all that,

145
00:09:01,083 --> 00:09:03,166
they also have special magical
abilities and are protecting

146
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:06,291
many people's
homelands at the same time.

147
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:09,041
The Witches are really
amazing, aren't they?

148
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:11,958
But the only thing I know
how to do is heal people!

149
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:13,791
At least you can do something...

150
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:15,708
All I do is slow everyone down.

151
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't do anything.

152
00:09:17,083 --> 00:09:19,541
Aw, that's not true.

153
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:22,333
Come on, let's keep going.

154
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:23,958
I'm sorry!

155
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:26,750
It's okay... Silly.

156
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,500
Wow! That's amazing!

157
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:34,666
This is the highest
point on the entire base.

158
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,916
So the whole island
is the base, then?

159
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,333
Yeah. We're right off
of the Strait of Dover.

160
00:09:39,416 --> 00:09:41,166
It looks really
small from far away.

161
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,375
And...

162
00:09:42,458 --> 00:09:44,583
if you look over there,
you can see Europe.

163
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:46,875
Unfortunately, the
majority of it has fallen

164
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,208
into the enemy's hands.

165
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:53,625
It's so quiet here...
and yet, there's a war going on.

166
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:56,166
You can run faster than that!

167
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:57,458
Miyafuji!

168
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,041
Tell me what you
see in front of you!

169
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,083
The sea!

170
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:00,958
Lynnette!

171
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,041
Tell me what's beyond the sea!

172
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,541
Europe is, Ma'am!

173
00:10:03,625 --> 00:10:05,625
And what is the
situation in Europe?!

174
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,833
It's being occupied
by the enemy!

175
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,000
That's right!

176
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,666
It's up to you to
regain that territory!

177
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:13,291
The only way you're going
to do that is by training!

178
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,625
Got it?! Training!
Training! Training!

179
00:10:15,708 --> 00:10:17,208
Move!

180
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,541
What you need more than magical
strength is physical strength!

181
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:20,625
Yes Ma'am!

182
00:10:20,708 --> 00:10:22,916
Good...! Give me ten more!

183
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,541
Right!

184
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,000
Miyafuji! Eyes forward!

185
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:35,000
Ye... Yes Ma'am!

186
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:48,250
Two more sets!

187
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:51,375
I can't...

188
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:54,041
Me... neither!

189
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,208
A little too much to the right.

190
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:08,000
Pay more attention to the wind.

191
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,875
Yes Ma'am!

192
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:19,666
Good... nice shot Lynne.

193
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,250
That was amazing...!

194
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:25,083
Wow I can't even see
the target from here!

195
00:11:25,166 --> 00:11:25,875
I'm sorry.

196
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:26,708
'kay Miyafuji!

197
00:11:26,791 --> 00:11:28,583
You're up. Get in position!

198
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,083
Next thing we need
to do is get you trained

199
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:37,250
on the Striker Unit equipment!

200
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:38,375
Major Sakamoto...

201
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,958
Permission to assist
our new recruits?

202
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,541
Permission granted and
may I say I am impressed.

203
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:45,333
Good to see you volunteering
your time.

204
00:11:45,416 --> 00:11:47,916
Well... I'm happy to help

205
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,625
and I figured it might be
easier to work in pairs.

206
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,583
Good thinking, Perrine.

207
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:56,541
I'm Perrine Clostermann,

208
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,708
Lieutenant of the
Gallia Armee de l'Air.

209
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:02,083
I've been under Major Sakamoto's
care for a very long time now...

210
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,291
You should know
you're very lucky

211
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,791
to have me accompanying you.

212
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:05,458
Oh yes!

213
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:06,708
Thank you so much...

214
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,250
I promise to do my best.

215
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,500
Worn out already, Miyafuji?

216
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,708
Well, it's your first day.

217
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,291
That's to be expected...

218
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:31,041
Though I didn't think your magic
control would be so sloppy...

219
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,333
You need to work on your
baseline stamina too.

220
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,541
And I suggest

221
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,750
you start working on
these things right away.

222
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,041
Otherwise you'll
continue to be a nuisance.

223
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:40,666
Honestly, I think you'd
be better off going home.

224
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:42,916
She's a novice, Perrine.

225
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
This is her first day...

226
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,750
Don't be so hard on her.

227
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:46,833
Oh. Right.

228
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:48,125
Well, there's an
aerial combat technique

229
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,291
I'm trying to perfect
in case of an attack...

230
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,333
I see.

231
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,500
Shall we go up
one more time, then?

232
00:12:52,583 --> 00:12:54,666
Oh yes, I'd love to!

233
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,583
Miyafuji, Lynnette,
that will be all for today.

234
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,208
She doesn't seem to be
showing any improvement.

235
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,833
She's having some
trouble with control,

236
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,583
but her magical powers
are quite strong.

237
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,416
Lynnette's doing
great, isn't she?

238
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,916
I don't know why she can't
do this outside of training.

239
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:42,250
I would be happy if she did
only half as well in battle.

240
00:13:42,333 --> 00:13:44,083
Agreed.

241
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:48,208
Good work!

242
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,708
You're done for today!

243
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,500
Captain Barkhorn...

244
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:01,125
Newbie...

245
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:03,041
Yes!

246
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,166
Don't you realize
this is the front line?

247
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:07,583
Your skills in combat
are all that matters here.

248
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,208
Are you prepared to die?

249
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,375
Well... I dunno...

250
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,541
I just really want
to help people.

251
00:14:15,916 --> 00:14:18,666
The Neuroi aren't gonna wait for
you to improve your training...

252
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,666
So if you want to survive...

253
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,291
I suggest you become stronger.

254
00:14:32,833 --> 00:14:35,000
Sergeant Miyafuji?

255
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,708
Hi Lynette!

256
00:14:38,916 --> 00:14:41,958
You um... You found
my favorite spot here.

257
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:44,666
I did? It's beautiful, isn't it?

258
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:46,291
Yes.

259
00:14:47,166 --> 00:14:49,041
I got in trouble again...

260
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,375
I need to try harder.

261
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,833
I'm a little jealous
of you, Miyafuji.

262
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,291
But why?

263
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:58,750
Your ability to keep trying
harder and never give up.

264
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,000
Wow.

265
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,000
That's exactly what it
says on my report card!

266
00:15:02,083 --> 00:15:02,958
I don't think there's
anything good anyone

267
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,583
could say about me.

268
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,333
I just don't belong here.

269
00:15:07,291 --> 00:15:08,041
That's not true!

270
00:15:08,125 --> 00:15:09,958
I saw you, you're amazing!

271
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:13,250
No... I'm not really.
Believe me.

272
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,125
Come on! Yes you are!

273
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,708
Only during training...

274
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:18,333
During actual
fighting, I'm a failure.

275
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:20,458
I can't even fly.

276
00:15:20,541 --> 00:15:22,041
But if you can do
it during training...

277
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,416
I know it's hard
for you to believe

278
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:27,541
'cause you're good at
everything, but I'm not you!

279
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,625
I'm sorry about that.

280
00:15:32,458 --> 00:15:33,958
Lynette, wait!

281
00:15:50,625 --> 00:15:53,041
We've received a report
from the observation post...

282
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:54,458
It looks like the enemy

283
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:57,333
has entered the
east grid, sector 114.

284
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:58,916
Altitude is higher than usual,

285
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,541
to compensate, we'll
be changing formation.

286
00:16:01,625 --> 00:16:03,458
Barkhorn and Hartmann
will be up front...

287
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,208
Shirley and Lucchini
will take the rear.

288
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,541
Perrine, you're with me.

289
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,583
The rest of you will stand
by at the base with me!

290
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,208
Roger!

291
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,000
Wow, look at 'em go!

292
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,375
Yeah, it's great.

293
00:16:15,458 --> 00:16:18,083
Is there anything we can
be doing right now to help?

294
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:21,166
Maybe you can, but
I would just get in the way.

295
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,208
Where are you going?!

296
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,708
Miyafuji, may I speak
with you for a moment.

297
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,250
Uh... sure...

298
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:31,666
Britannia is Sergeant Bishop's
homeland so she's sensitive.

299
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:34,916
You are aware that
Europe has recently fallen

300
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,166
into the hands of
the Neuroi, aren't you?

301
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:38,916
Yes... Lynnette told me.

302
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:42,166
That's why this
is so hard for her,

303
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:45,958
you see, Britannia may
be Europe's last hope.

304
00:16:46,041 --> 00:16:47,708
And... the pressure
becomes too much

305
00:16:47,791 --> 00:16:50,541
for her when defending
it during combat.

306
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,666
I understand.

307
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:53,916
So what about you?

308
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,458
Why did you decide
to join the Witches?

309
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:57,958
Me...?

310
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,083
I want to help people who
are in need and protect them.

311
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,583
You know, that's
exactly what Lynne said

312
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:04,208
when she first enlisted...

313
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:06,125
Never forget those feelings...

314
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:09,916
I'm sure your desire to help
everyone will give you strength.

315
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:19,791
Enemy sighted...! Attack!

316
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,125
That was almost
too easy, wasn't it?

317
00:17:36,208 --> 00:17:37,291
Something isn't right...

318
00:17:37,375 --> 00:17:39,083
I can't seem to find the core.

319
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,250
Do you think it
could be a diversion?

320
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:44,458
Let's go!
The base is in trouble!

321
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,375
Lynnette?

322
00:17:48,041 --> 00:17:50,583
I um... I'm terrible at magic,

323
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:52,583
plus I'm always in trouble...

324
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:56,250
I can't fly... and
I wont use a gun...

325
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:57,625
What's more...

326
00:17:57,708 --> 00:18:01,083
I don't even care about
fighting against the Neuroi.

327
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,666
I just wanted to
be in the Witches...

328
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:06,666
I want to be able to use
my magic to help someone...

329
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,625
Even if it's just one person.

330
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,416
But I hope it's not...

331
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:11,666
Because...

332
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:14,375
I want to protect everyone.

333
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,208
Protect...?

334
00:18:16,291 --> 00:18:18,625
That's why I keep on trying

335
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,166
and that's why you
should too, Lynnette.

336
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,666
You're saying you and I are the
only ones who can do this...?

337
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:30,125
But what about Sanya?

338
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,125
She used up all of her magic
during the night patrol...

339
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:34,833
No good.

340
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:38,125
Right... Well, it's
just the two of us then.

341
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,333
I want to go, too!

342
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:43,750
Thank you, Sergeant Miyafuji,

343
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,708
but it's much too
soon for you to fight.

344
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:46,583
No it's not.

345
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:47,833
I won't get in anyone's way.

346
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:49,333
Please, I want to help!

347
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,125
I cannot send someone with
inadequate training into battle.

348
00:18:52,208 --> 00:18:53,458
That would mean certain death.

349
00:18:53,541 --> 00:18:54,958
Not to mention the
fact that you don't even

350
00:18:55,041 --> 00:18:56,416
want to shoot a weapon.

351
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:59,125
I'll shoot...
to protect someone!

352
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:00,958
Miyafuji?

353
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:02,375
None of that matters, Miyafuji.

354
00:19:02,458 --> 00:19:03,791
You're just not ready.

355
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:04,958
But...

356
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,833
Then I'm going, too!

357
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,375
Lynnette...

358
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:11,625
If you let us work together,
we'll be just as strong as one.

359
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:15,666
You have ninety
seconds to get ready.

360
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:17,208
Roger!

361
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,666
Looks like the enemy will be
approaching from three o' clock.

362
00:19:23,750 --> 00:19:25,041
Eila and I will move on ahead.

363
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,500
You two stay behind
and provide back up, okay?

364
00:19:27,583 --> 00:19:28,541
Right!

365
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:29,750
Right.

366
00:19:29,833 --> 00:19:32,166
Alright, we're counting on you!

367
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:37,083
Miyafuji?

368
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,541
I was actually really
scared when we volunteered.

369
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,375
I'm still really scared.

370
00:19:42,458 --> 00:19:44,291
I know this may sound strange,

371
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:46,583
but I would've been more afraid
if we'd just stayed behind

372
00:19:46,666 --> 00:19:48,500
and not done anything.

373
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,750
That's what I usually do.

374
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,291
What's wrong?

375
00:19:55,375 --> 00:19:57,541
Look over there!

376
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,833
Fast.

377
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,750
This is by far the
fastest one, yet.

378
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:09,541
Boom and Zoom tactics
aren't going to work...

379
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,125
Prepare to match speed!

380
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,000
Neuroi?

381
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,750
I'm afraid so.

382
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:26,583
It's coming this way!

383
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,625
It's speeding up.

384
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,458
It's too fast...! This is bad.

385
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:54,291
I can't do it! I can't hit it!

386
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:55,541
Yes you can!

387
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,625
It's just like when
you were in training!

388
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,541
It's taking everything
I've got just to fly.

389
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,333
I won't have enough energy
to control my shots with magic.

390
00:21:02,416 --> 00:21:03,166
Fine.

391
00:21:03,250 --> 00:21:04,916
Then I'll support you. Okay.

392
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,958
That way you can just
concentrate on shooting!

393
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:10,958
What're you doing ...?

394
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,833
Wait!

395
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,416
See...? Don't you
feel more stable?

396
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:18,000
Um, well, yeah... Thanks.

397
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:21,958
Bishop, Miyafuji, the enemy
is heading in your direction.

398
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:24,166
You're the ones we're
counting on at this point.

399
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:25,291
This is your moment.

400
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,666
Right!

401
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:33,458
West-northwest wind... velocity
3... and speed... position...

402
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:34,625
That's it!

403
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,666
If I calculate the
enemy's future position

404
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:40,208
after evasion and
use that as my target...

405
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,291
When I give you the signal...

406
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,083
I'm gonna need you
to shoot with me!

407
00:21:44,166 --> 00:21:46,458
Okay, you got it!

408
00:21:52,958 --> 00:21:54,666
Shoot now!

409
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:02,458
Hit it!

410
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:16,083
Lynnette...! You did it!

411
00:22:17,166 --> 00:22:18,833
Look at that!

412
00:22:19,958 --> 00:22:20,750
Miyafuji!

413
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,208
Did you see that?! I did it!

414
00:22:22,291 --> 00:22:23,541
That's the first time I've
ever been of use to anyone!

415
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:24,625
And it's all because of you!

416
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:26,375
Thank you so much!

417
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:36,666
We're friends aren't we?

418
00:22:36,750 --> 00:22:39,000
You can stop
calling me Miyafuji.

419
00:22:39,083 --> 00:22:41,208
And you can stop
calling me Lynnette.

420
00:22:41,291 --> 00:22:42,875
'Kay. Lynne, right?

421
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,458
Yep... Thanks Yoshika!

422
00:22:47,333 --> 00:22:50,000
I can't... I can't breathe...

423
00:24:24,208 --> 00:24:26,416
My homeland was
overrun by the Neuroi

424
00:24:26,500 --> 00:24:28,500
and eventually went
down in flames...

425
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:31,583
Now, there is nothing
left for me but to fight...

426
00:24:31,666 --> 00:24:33,916
Even if it means
I fight alone...

427
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:37,000
Next time on Strike Witches:
"Thanks."
