1
00:00:44,583 --> 00:00:46,875
I wanted to thank
you for all your help.

2
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,916
I've made some snacks
for everyone to eat

3
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:51,958
as a way of saying 'thank you.'

4
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,708
These desserts are
from my homeland, Fuso.

5
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,958
I'm sorry ma'am...

6
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,750
Commander Minna has
prohibited us from having

7
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:07,583
any unnecessary conversations
with any of you Strike Witches.

8
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:48,875
The wind sure is blowing today.

9
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,208
It sure is...

10
00:02:50,291 --> 00:02:52,958
but at least the laundry
will dry a lot faster.

11
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,750
Something weird happened...

12
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:59,208
I was in the
hanger earlier today...

13
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,875
That is kinda strange.

14
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:05,958
So...

15
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,166
Why do you think
Commander Minna would

16
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:08,916
make up a rule like that...?

17
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,375
Do you know Lynne?

18
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,166
I'd heard of it before
but I guess I never

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,333
really thought there was
anything weird about it.

20
00:03:15,416 --> 00:03:17,875
Well. It just doesn't
make any sense;

21
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,458
it's such a dumb order...!

22
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:22,166
You have to agree
with me on this one.

23
00:03:23,416 --> 00:03:25,375
I haven't really had
the opportunity to talk

24
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:29,041
to many men unless
you include my brothers.

25
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,291
Not even when you
were attending school?

26
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:34,291
I went to Our Mother
of Mercy all girls school.

27
00:03:34,375 --> 00:03:35,625
Oh okay.

28
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:37,625
I guess I'm not
much help at this.

29
00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:39,166
Don't worry.

30
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:44,041
Oh, wow! Look! It's the Akagi!

31
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,541
The Akagi?

32
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,750
It's the ship that
brought me here.

33
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:49,416
I heard it was being repaired.

34
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,875
It must be fixed already.

35
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,375
Hey, there she is... Yoshika!

36
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,458
Commander Minna
wants to see you.

37
00:03:56,541 --> 00:04:00,708
Oh... Okay...! What'd I do?

38
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:05,708
Excuse me... um...

39
00:04:05,791 --> 00:04:07,291
Sergeant Miyafuji...

40
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,166
It's a pleasure
to finally meet you.

41
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,750
May I introduce the
Captain of the Akagi.

42
00:04:11,833 --> 00:04:14,541
He took time to come
over here and meet you.

43
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:15,833
I'm Captain Sugita.

44
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,375
On behalf of our entire crew,

45
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,458
I am here to express
our deepest thanks.

46
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:20,500
For what?

47
00:04:20,583 --> 00:04:22,083
It's a result of
your actions that

48
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,750
our fleet bound for Europe was
able to make it there at all.

49
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:27,166
Many lives were saved
that day because of you...

50
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,458
I wanted to come
thank you personally.

51
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:31,625
Why me?

52
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:33,208
I didn't do anything...

53
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,458
Sakamoto and the other witches

54
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,291
are the ones that
did all the work.

55
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:39,166
It's true, if you hadn't made
the choice to fly that day,

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:41,166
the whole fleet could
have been wiped out.

57
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,625
You should be very
proud of yourself, Miyafuji.

58
00:04:44,708 --> 00:04:46,708
If you say so... ma'am.

59
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:51,041
This is a small
token of appreciation

60
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:53,041
from myself and the crew.

61
00:04:53,125 --> 00:04:55,666
Wow, that is quite the
tremendous honor, Yohshika.

62
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:58,458
Now don't forget to
say thank you, Miyafuji.

63
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,958
Of course...

64
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,750
Thank you very much sir.

65
00:05:05,750 --> 00:05:08,166
Before we launch into the
counter offensive operation,

66
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,208
they've ordered us to
execute a probing attack.

67
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,541
That's good... It's about time.

68
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,208
Counter offensive?

69
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,541
Yes.

70
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:19,041
My stop here today is
actually a break from it.

71
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,666
We disembark tomorrow.

72
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:22,375
Please stop by if possible;

73
00:05:22,458 --> 00:05:25,416
the sailors would
love to see you again.

74
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,625
Yes, sir.

75
00:05:26,708 --> 00:05:28,000
Unfortunately captain,

76
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,958
we've already been scheduled
for a mission tomorrow.

77
00:05:31,041 --> 00:05:34,250
I see. That's too bad.

78
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:37,916
But the Captain's in
charge of the carrier group

79
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,791
so he outranks Commander Minna.

80
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:40,833
Really...?

81
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,791
I didn't know he
was so important.

82
00:05:42,875 --> 00:05:44,208
I can't believe the Captain came

83
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,291
to thank you in person,
that's amazing.

84
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,416
Sergeant Miyafuji.

85
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,000
I really wanted to thank
you for saving our ship

86
00:05:53,083 --> 00:05:54,166
from the Neuroi.

87
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:55,833
I thought that you
were totally amazing...

88
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:57,625
I bought this card at PX for you

89
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,333
because I couldn't
afford flowers.

90
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:02,791
Oh... okay...
that's sweet I guess.

91
00:06:02,875 --> 00:06:06,791
Uhh, well... will you...
take this card...

92
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,125
Please do, I got
it just for you.

93
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,125
The rules... I don't think I-

94
00:06:11,208 --> 00:06:13,208
Oh, I bet it's a love letter.

95
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,000
 A love letter?

96
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:18,416
Here let me free
up your hands 'kay.

97
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,375
No!

98
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:35,833
Cute.

99
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,583
That was lucky.

100
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:55,500
Commander Minna.

101
00:06:55,583 --> 00:06:59,125
You're both aware fraternization
has been strictly prohibited

102
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:00,375
It's my fault ma'am...

103
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:02,541
I was only trying to
say thank you to her.

104
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:03,750
It's true.

105
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:06,583
He wasn't doing
anything wrong commander.

106
00:07:10,458 --> 00:07:11,583
Unnecessary contact

107
00:07:11,666 --> 00:07:13,833
with the witches is
against regulations...

108
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:17,250
I cannot allow you to
give her this contraband.

109
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,708
It was my mistake sorry.

110
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:27,750
Commander Minna seemed so angry.

111
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,958
I wonder what he wrote to you.

112
00:07:31,958 --> 00:07:33,791
Hey, Yoshika?

113
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,500
I heard about the letter.

114
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,083
Mio...

115
00:08:15,166 --> 00:08:18,375
You forbid her from
accepting it, didn't you?

116
00:08:18,458 --> 00:08:21,083
It is against base regulations.

117
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,958
You still haven't let go.

118
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:34,041
Wow... a Fuso Doll.

119
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:35,958
It's adorable.

120
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,208
Hey Lynne...

121
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:40,416
How can I thank them?

122
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:48,833
Initial reports from Gallia
are that the enemy is advancing.

123
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,041
It seems they finally got their
predictions right for once.

124
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,500
Yes... Their current
altitude is 15,000

125
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,458
and they are headed directly
for the southeast base.

126
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,708
Right...

127
00:08:59,791 --> 00:09:01,625
We will execute Intercept
pattern alpha tango seven.

128
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,166
So here are your assignments.

129
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,083
Barkhorn and Hartmann
will take the lead.

130
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,083
Perrine and Lynne
will follow up behind...

131
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:09,875
Miyafuji, Minna and
I will take the rear.

132
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,625
While the rest of
you will remain here

133
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,541
at the base on highest alert.

134
00:09:13,625 --> 00:09:16,250
I love it when we
get to house sit!

135
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,208
I can adjust the gyro
on my Striker Unit.

136
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,000
Right... You are all dismissed.

137
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,583
Kay, see you later!

138
00:09:44,708 --> 00:09:45,750
Enemy sighted.

139
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:46,916
It's class?

140
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,666
Confirming that now.

141
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,583
M class... 300...
Standard attack formation?

142
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:58,916
Affirmative.

143
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,166
Yes ma'am... Move out!

144
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,500
That's not good.

145
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:15,125
It divided.

146
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,291
There's eighty on the right,

147
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,333
one hundred in the center,
and thirty on the left.

148
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:23,083
That's two-hundred
and ten in all.

149
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:25,375
We should all be getting
medals after this one.

150
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:26,583
That's right.

151
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,333
So... What's the plan?

152
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:30,208
I need you to locate the core.

153
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,583
Roger that.

154
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:32,833
Barkhorn you take the middle.

155
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:33,875
Yes, ma'am.

156
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,625
Perrine, your
team has the right.

157
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:36,958
Yes ma'am.

158
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:40,000
Miyafuji, I want you to
stay with Major Sakamoto.

159
00:10:40,083 --> 00:10:41,541
Yes ma'am.

160
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,333
Keep the path clear for the
Major until she finds the core.

161
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,583
Do I make myself clear sergeant?

162
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,291
Yes ma'am.

163
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,750
That makes ten!

164
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,041
I've got twelve.

165
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,333
Nice to have a little
friendly competition.

166
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,875
It does seem like
it's been forever.

167
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:10,541
Your gun's not
suited for rapid firing.

168
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:12,500
So stay up here and
pick them off for me.

169
00:11:12,583 --> 00:11:13,625
Yes ma'am.

170
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,250
Just make sure
you cover my back.

171
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,333
You got that!

172
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:21,500
Casting this always messes up my
hair for the rest of the day...

173
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:26,791
Tonnerre!

174
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:32,208
That's what you Neuroi
get for messing with me.

175
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:44,416
It seems you're not useless.

176
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:47,791
They're all so... incredible.

177
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,958
Just like that every time.

178
00:11:58,041 --> 00:11:59,583
Right Major.

179
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:13,166
Twenty!

180
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,666
There's no end.

181
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,625
Where the hell is the core?

182
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,083
Have you located the core?

183
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,250
No, not yet.

184
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:38,041
Okay... do you think
it's a diversion?

185
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,250
I doubt it...

186
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,875
I can sense the core nearby,

187
00:12:40,958 --> 00:12:43,291
but it's not emanating
out of the main group.

188
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:47,166
The battlefield
appears to be moving.

189
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,291
Agreed.

190
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,708
It's migrating
toward the continent.

191
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,291
Up there!

192
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:56,541
Damn it.

193
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:57,958
I can't see.

194
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:00,000
I've got them.

195
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:06,625
Just keep firing...

196
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:07,833
You've almost got them.

197
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,791
Yes ma'am.

198
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,916
I've found it.

199
00:13:18,333 --> 00:13:18,750
There.

200
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:19,375
That one?

201
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:20,416
Yes ma'am.

202
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,541
Attention all units...

203
00:13:21,625 --> 00:13:23,583
The enemy core has been located.

204
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,083
Keep those other Neuroi
off of us, while we engage.

205
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,458
Yes ma'am!

206
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,083
Alright.

207
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,250
Let's go.

208
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:31,166
Right!

209
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,500
There!

210
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,000
Miyafuji, it's all yours.

211
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:45,541
Right!

212
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:03,833
Mio!

213
00:14:04,541 --> 00:14:06,958
Yoshika, you were amazing!

214
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,500
Just a lucky shot
is all that was.

215
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:13,708
Yeah... lucky we had Miyafuji
on the team targeting the core,

216
00:14:13,791 --> 00:14:15,541
I think that's what
you meant to say.

217
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,500
Wow Miyafuji, you're
a pretty good shot.

218
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,666
You really think so?

219
00:14:24,791 --> 00:14:26,083
It's beautiful.

220
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:26,875
Yes...

221
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,291
When they're neutralized.

222
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:32,166
Even the most beautiful
flowers may have some thorns.

223
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:34,000
Talking about yourself?

224
00:14:34,083 --> 00:14:36,958
That is so rude.

225
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,791
Except... the part
about being beautiful.

226
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,208
That's true...

227
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:42,208
I don't know.

228
00:14:42,291 --> 00:14:44,291
I think you're pretty thorny.

229
00:14:44,375 --> 00:14:46,791
Why must you always bring
others down to your level?

230
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:47,541
Ha ha.

231
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:49,750
Thorny Perrine.

232
00:14:52,833 --> 00:14:54,791
Minna, wait.

233
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,291
Hey... Where is she going?

234
00:14:57,375 --> 00:14:58,458
Not now...

235
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:01,541
She needs to be left alone.

236
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:06,208
I see... This is Pas-de-Callais

237
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:33,083
Ostmark has just been destroyed.

238
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,458
I know...

239
00:15:34,541 --> 00:15:37,791
I received my orders to
transfer to the front lines.

240
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:41,916
I volunteered to go as well.

241
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:45,750
No... We agreed that
you'd go study music.

242
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,083
Before the invasion started,

243
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:54,333
you wanted to study
music in Vienna with me.

244
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,708
I'm a witch.

245
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,541
I have a duty to use my
powers to protect everyone.

246
00:15:58,625 --> 00:16:01,291
My love, I don't want you
to fight at the front line.

247
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:02,416
That doesn't matter.

248
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:06,958
I have to go fight...
but you don't.

249
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:10,333
I can't bear to let you
go so I'm coming with you.

250
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:17,541
No, Minna!

251
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,375
Operation Dynamo
seems to be working.

252
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,833
I don't think they'll be able
to evacuate Gallia fast enough.

253
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:44,916
I heard most people are getting
out on the trains to the south.

254
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,958
There's not going
to be enough time.

255
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:49,916
We have to at least
evacuate all of the civilians.

256
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,625
Then we've got stay
here till they're gone.

257
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:56,583
That's right... you witches
are our guardian angels.

258
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,666
Okay, you're all set to go.

259
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:08,833
We're going to have
to abandon this base.

260
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,166
When the battle's over,

261
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,041
you should rendezvous with
the others in Britannia.

262
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,125
What about you?

263
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:14,875
We'll be leaving
right behind you...

264
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:16,875
I'll meet you over there.

265
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,333
Promise me you will.

266
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,916
Of course.

267
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,875
Minna, I've got a
present to give you later.

268
00:17:42,208 --> 00:17:43,708
They haven't arrived yet...?

269
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,875
None of them.

270
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:48,458
Wait.

271
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:49,791
Minna, the other units

272
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,625
are doing all they can
to support the retreat...

273
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,750
And our powers are too weak for
us to be of any use right now.

274
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:58,416
No... he's...
he's right over there!

275
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,875
I'm sorry, Minna.

276
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,375
Are you ready to go now?

277
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:36,958
I am... Come on.

278
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:39,625
Let's get back to the base.

279
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:41,583
Alright Commander.

280
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:48,333
She didn't come after all.

281
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:00,583
It's Miyafuji!

282
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,375
Hi! Thank you everyone!

283
00:19:12,458 --> 00:19:14,041
Thank you!

284
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:18,166
Please be careful...! We'll be
there when you need us most.

285
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:21,583
Yeah, we will...!
Won't we Yoshika.

286
00:19:22,416 --> 00:19:24,583
They got my thank you.

287
00:19:24,666 --> 00:19:26,666
They appreciate what
you've done for them.

288
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,041
Yeah...

289
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:29,875
They all look so happy.

290
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:32,416
Yeah they do.

291
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,166
Alright, let's head
back to the base.

292
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:36,291
Yes ma'am.

293
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:41,708
Captain, we have an
incoming transmission.

294
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,666
Put it through.

295
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:51,375
It can't be... Patch
it throughout the ship.

296
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:52,750
Yes sir...

297
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:57,458

take you away from me? ♪

00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:53,583
Great song, Minna...

306
00:20:53,666 --> 00:20:55,250
That was incredible...

307
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,791
That was beautiful...

308
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:01,208
Minna, that song
was so beautiful.

309
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,916
Well, thank you.

310
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,500
Oww... What do you
think you're doing?

311
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,583
No mention of Sanya's
piano playing... Why's that?

312
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,125
It was very beautiful
too. I promise.

313
00:21:13,208 --> 00:21:14,250
Don't stop there.

314
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:15,708
Tell me more...

315
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,208
 I'm telling you.

316
00:21:17,291 --> 00:21:18,375
Anything else...?

317
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,208
Oh, Please let me go now.

318
00:21:20,291 --> 00:21:22,500
Nope, you're not done just yet.

319
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:26,166
Come on, it's starting
to hurt my face.

320
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,041
Stop laughing
and help me. EILA!!!

321
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:42,291
That was a perfect song.

322
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:45,458
Why thank you, Mio.

323
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:53,791
Thank you for granting
permission to see them off.

324
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,375
You wanted to go
with them, didn't you?

325
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:59,541
That ship protected
me for a long time.

326
00:22:06,291 --> 00:22:08,416
When I lost him I was
certain the ache in my heart

327
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,125
would never stop hurting...

328
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:12,416
To shelter myself
from future anguish,

329
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:16,083
I swore I'd never love anyone.

330
00:22:16,166 --> 00:22:19,875
But... I was wrong...

331
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,791
Is that so...?

332
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:28,000
Even now I'm afraid
of losing someone...

333
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:32,375
So I have to make sure
that never happens again...

334
00:24:23,708 --> 00:24:26,708
She's hanging around
Major Sakamoto again...

335
00:24:26,791 --> 00:24:29,375
I'm going to have to
teach her a lesson or two...

336
00:24:29,458 --> 00:24:31,291
I won't let that
little raccoon-dog

337
00:24:31,375 --> 00:24:33,500
back into the Major's life...

338
00:24:33,583 --> 00:24:37,416
Next time on Strike Witches:
"What I Want to Protect."
