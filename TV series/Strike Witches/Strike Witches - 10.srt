1
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:32,000
So you're really gonna fly?

2
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:35,291
True... I've done a lot
of thinking about it...

3
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:37,166
I'm already twenty...

4
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:39,875
My powers aren't as strong
as they used to be.

5
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,958
It doesn't matter
how hard I train.

6
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:45,333
I'm a Witch and in the end,
we all have the same fate.

7
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:46,333
Hey!

8
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,666
I just don't understand it.

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:50,541
You don't act like
you could be our enemy.

10
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:53,791
What do you think
you're doing, Miyafuji?

11
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,208
Sakamoto!

12
00:00:55,291 --> 00:00:56,791
Damn you!

13
00:01:04,541 --> 00:01:06,791
Major!

14
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:10,833
What was that...?!
What happened?

15
00:01:10,916 --> 00:01:13,333
Sakamoto was shot by the Neuroi!

16
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,791
She put up her shield,
but she's hurt pretty badly!

17
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,791
Major, Major!

18
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,666
Major, please be okay.

19
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,416
Please, open your eyes...

20
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,625
Can you hear me...?

21
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:30,750
Sakamoto, please!

22
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:32,875
Answer!

23
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:34,958
Sakamoto!

24
00:03:06,208 --> 00:03:08,791
Major! Can you hear me?!

25
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:10,208
I'm here...

26
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:12,125
Everything's gonna be
all right Major, I promise...

27
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,916
Please answer me!

28
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:16,875
Do something!

29
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,708
Are you okay?

30
00:03:30,791 --> 00:03:32,666
I've got you.

31
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:35,791
No... It's all my fault!

32
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:41,041
Sakamoto...

33
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,416
Come on... Please wake up...

34
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,958
You have to...

35
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:49,250
For me...
Open your eyes... please...

36
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,333
Yoshika!

37
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,375
Let go of me right now...!

38
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:54,375
I'm fine!

39
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,708
Sergeant Miyafuji, calm down!

40
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:58,333
Minna...

41
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,041
Major!

42
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,458
Major!

43
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,416
Miyafuji!

44
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,250
No, Yoshika...!
Do you need a doctor?

45
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:15,250
Are you okay?

46
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:18,458
Can you hear me? Yoshika!

47
00:04:38,541 --> 00:04:40,416
How are you feeling?

48
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,458
Uh... fine...?

49
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,666
You're up at least...
That's good.

50
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,166
Where am I?

51
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,791
Is she gonna be
okay...?! Sakamoto!

52
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,208
What happened to her...?

53
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,958
Answer me, Lynne!

54
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,666
Has there been any improvement?

55
00:05:09,750 --> 00:05:10,875
No.

56
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,083
But it's still too early
to make predictions.

57
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:42,583
All this is because of you!

58
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:44,708
Well say something...!

59
00:05:44,791 --> 00:05:46,875
Or are you still waking up
from your damn nap!

60
00:05:46,958 --> 00:05:49,166
She passed out from using all
her power to help Major...

61
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,541
Would you just shut up?!

62
00:05:50,625 --> 00:05:51,458
No, I won't...!

63
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,625
You're not being fair!

64
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:54,250
Yoshika was trying to help!

65
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:56,791
And look at how
much good it's done!

66
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:01,750
Yoshika, wait!

67
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,625
Please wake up.

68
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,875
Have you heard
anything about the Major?

69
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,416
Not yet. We're still waiting.

70
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,916
But in the meantime,
I bought us some food.

71
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,375
Not that again.

72
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:20,541
Well aren't we picky...?

73
00:06:20,625 --> 00:06:22,583
Shirley...? What will happen...?

74
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:26,708
Do you think Yoshika'll be
okay after disobeying orders?

75
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:27,666
What is it?

76
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,333
I'm reading Yoshika's fortune.

77
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:31,833
Yeah? What did it say?

78
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,708
Says death.

79
00:06:36,291 --> 00:06:38,625
We're dealing with unauthorized
actions and a violation

80
00:06:38,708 --> 00:06:40,500
of orders leading to a
superior getting injured

81
00:06:40,583 --> 00:06:42,041
and the enemy slipping away...

82
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:43,500
It's a serious offense.

83
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,041
So...

84
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,708
You're saying she should get
court-martialled and shot, huh?

85
00:06:46,791 --> 00:06:48,500
No, that's not what I'm saying!

86
00:06:48,583 --> 00:06:49,416
I know...!

87
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,583
If that were the case

88
00:06:50,666 --> 00:06:52,791
then I'd have been
killed a bunch of times.

89
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,833
Damn it, Erica...

90
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:55,875
Do you think you could take
this a little more seriously?

91
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,416
Okay...
That's enough, you two...

92
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:59,916
I'll handle this after
Major Sakamoto wakes up.

93
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:00,958
Okay!

94
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:02,833
Don't go too easy on her.

95
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,583
Yoshika, look!
I think we've got a pulse!

96
00:07:10,666 --> 00:07:11,541
Sakamoto!

97
00:07:11,625 --> 00:07:13,125
Major!

98
00:07:13,916 --> 00:07:15,000
Please hang in there!

99
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,166
Can you hear us?!

100
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,000
Be right back...

101
00:07:17,083 --> 00:07:18,958
I'm gonna go get the doctor!

102
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:20,166
Come on...!

103
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,666
I don't get it,
I'm giving it all I've got.

104
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:22,666
Oh please...

105
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:24,333
I'm so scared...

106
00:07:24,416 --> 00:07:27,416
I need help, I wish mom
and grandma were here.

107
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:30,791
Well, they're not,

108
00:07:30,875 --> 00:07:32,291
so you're just gonna
have to keep trying...!

109
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,625
I'm sorry, It's just you're
the only one who can help...

110
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:36,583
Please don't
give up, Miyafuji...

111
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,583
Are you listening to me?!

112
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:43,041
I'm the only one?

113
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:49,666
You're right...

114
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,375
I am the only one
who can help her now...

115
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:52,625
I'm not giving up.

116
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,708
Thank you.

117
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,375
I can do this...
just concentrate.

118
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,583
She's gonna be all right.

119
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,583
That's an amazing magical
touch she's got there.

120
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,458
Mio... 

121
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,000
Are you... still gonna fly?

122
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,375
Oh... sorry.

123
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:12,541
You look pale...

124
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:15,125
You should try to
get some rest yourself.

125
00:09:15,666 --> 00:09:17,833
Thanks again.

126
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,625
Why didn't you shoot?

127
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:25,625
You know what I'm
talking about, Miyafuji.

128
00:09:25,708 --> 00:09:28,833
Why didn't you shoot the Neuroi?

129
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,125
I just couldn't, I dunno...

130
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,000
Because it was
shaped like a human...?

131
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:38,166
That was just a
trap to lure you in!

132
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:39,250
You sure...?

133
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,958
'Cause at the time
it seemed like...

134
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:43,000
like it really wanted
to be my friend!

135
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:46,000
It's the enemy...
Not your friend!

136
00:09:53,291 --> 00:09:57,250
Major Sakamoto... You're okay!

137
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,875
Sergeant Yoshika Miyafuji,

138
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,291
in addition to performing
unauthorized actions,

139
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,500
you have ignored
a superior officer...

140
00:10:03,583 --> 00:10:05,000
These are serious offences.

141
00:10:05,083 --> 00:10:05,833
Yes ma'am.

142
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,208
As you know,

143
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,333
I am the only judicial
officer in this squadron...

144
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,916
I'll give you the option...

145
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,208
So, do you wish for a
court-martial to be convened?

146
00:10:15,041 --> 00:10:16,125
I... um...

147
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,666
Alright, from your
lack of response

148
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:21,291
I will conclude that you do
not wish for a court-martial.

149
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,000
Due to your violation of
orders from a superior...

150
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,041
With the exception
of your duties on base,

151
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,791
daily meals and medical needs...

152
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:30,708
I'm sentencing you to
ten days of confinement.

153
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,958
Do you object?

154
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,166
No, but...

155
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:34,208
When the Neuroi
was shaped like a...

156
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:37,833
I'll ask you again...
Objections?

157
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,708
Please just listen to me!

158
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:43,625
Do you object?

159
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:44,958
No ma'am.

160
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:46,916
Then you're dismissed.

161
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,916
Yoshika, hi!

162
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,000
The major's doing better...

163
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,291
Isn't that great news?

164
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,791
Aren't you happy?

165
00:11:02,208 --> 00:11:03,000
I know...!

166
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,291
Let's take a bath together...!

167
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,583
You're probably drained...

168
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:07,375
This'll help!

169
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:11,041
Come on, hurry it up!

170
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,375
'Kay, just a minute.

171
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,250
Here we are!

172
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:18,208
Over here!

173
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,000
Hey... Yoshika...

174
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,041
I heard you got
confined to your room...

175
00:11:23,125 --> 00:11:23,875
You're lucky.

176
00:11:23,958 --> 00:11:25,166
That could actually be fun!

177
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:27,000
Yeah and it could've
been a lot worse.

178
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:30,083
Shirley got the imprisonment
penalty five times!

179
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,625
Hey, what the hell...?

180
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,750
It was four times...

181
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:33,833
Learn how to count.

182
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:36,041
I win... Six times!

183
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:40,125
I have to tell you something...!

184
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,666
It's about the Neuroi...

185
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:43,875
I think the one that I met
was different from the others.

186
00:11:43,958 --> 00:11:45,250
It was friendly...

187
00:11:45,333 --> 00:11:47,250
It made me think that maybe
not all of them are bad,

188
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,416
maybe we don't have
to fight them at all...

189
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,708
What the hell are
you talking about?

190
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,291
Please calm down.

191
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,666
I'm saying back there it felt
like we understood each other.

192
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,208
Really?

193
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,791
Do you realize what they've
done to us all these years...?

194
00:11:56,875 --> 00:11:58,875
They've done nothing
but terrorize people...

195
00:11:58,958 --> 00:12:01,125
Are you trying to say that
you're on their side now?

196
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:03,416
I'm just talking about one...!

197
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:04,625
This one was different!

198
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:05,875
Do you really think
you've fought enough

199
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:07,875
of them to make
that distinction?!

200
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,666
I've heard of a
human-shaped one appearing,

201
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:15,250
but never seen one.

202
00:12:15,333 --> 00:12:17,250
Did it appear at
the Kauhava Base...?

203
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:18,833
Because that's just a rumor.

204
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:19,958
But...

205
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:21,791
Wasn't the singing
Neuroi human shaped?

206
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,708
Who cares?

207
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,416
That whole thing
was just a trap!

208
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:30,041
Yoshika, this is
supposed to be relaxing...

209
00:12:30,125 --> 00:12:31,541
Cheer up!

210
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:32,833
Gotcha!

211
00:12:32,916 --> 00:12:34,083
Uh! Francesca stop!

212
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,250
Lucchini!

213
00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:36,958
So do you think
you've gotten any bigger?

214
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,625
No.

215
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:40,916
Yoshika's aren't big enough yet.

216
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:46,208
Francesca, why are you
looking at me like that?

217
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:54,958
Shirley...

218
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,875
Now this is what
I'm talking about!

219
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,875
Wow, I wonder if that's any fun.

220
00:12:58,958 --> 00:13:00,708
No, it's stupid.

221
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,375
What do you think you're doing?!

222
00:13:03,458 --> 00:13:06,666
Hey yours are really
big and soft, Trudy!

223
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,875
These things are completely
useless in combat!

224
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:10,708
"These things"?

225
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:31,125
Alright, Miyafuji, this is it...

226
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:34,666
You may only leave your room
when absolutely necessary.

227
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:38,541
Why won't anyone believe me...?

228
00:13:38,625 --> 00:13:40,291
It's not fair...

229
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:42,625
Maybe I was wrong...?

230
00:13:43,500 --> 00:13:45,291
No.

231
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:50,833
I wonder...

232
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,916
Should I try again?

233
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,625
I have to...

234
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,083
I have to find out for myself.

235
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,583
May I start off
by saying that you

236
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,458
were always way too nice to her.

237
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,041
I mean all you did
was take her in

238
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:13,916
and let her be a part
of saving the world,

239
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,208
and what does she do?

240
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,541
She turns around
and gets you injured...

241
00:14:17,625 --> 00:14:20,333
I thought I'd lost you.

242
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:22,000
I mean, I know that
everything's okay now

243
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,500
and you survived...

244
00:14:23,583 --> 00:14:24,791
And I know...

245
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,875
I know it's mostly because
of her magic, but...

246
00:14:26,958 --> 00:14:28,875
Just because I don't
have a power like hers...

247
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:29,791
doesn't mean that she's...

248
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,375
Perrine!

249
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,625
Sorry.

250
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,916
People told me...

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,541
I know that you never left
my side the entire time...

252
00:14:42,625 --> 00:14:45,583
It means a lot...
I'm very grateful.

253
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,375
Oh, thank you.

254
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,708
Thank you.

255
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,166
Yoshika.

256
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,875
Oh, Lynne.

257
00:14:56,958 --> 00:14:57,750
Please don't do this.

258
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:58,916
If they find out that you left,

259
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,791
you'll get much worse
than confinement!

260
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:03,041
It's just something
I have to do!

261
00:15:03,125 --> 00:15:04,291
Look...

262
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,083
I don't know anything
about the Neuroi but...

263
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:07,291
I know you...!

264
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,291
You're someone
who doesn't give up...!

265
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,666
On anything or anyone
you really care about.

266
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:14,541
That's why...

267
00:15:14,625 --> 00:15:16,041
That's why I'm
going to go with you!

268
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:16,750
What?

269
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm gonna go get ready.

270
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,250
No Lynne...! You can't come!

271
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,208
Why not...?

272
00:15:24,291 --> 00:15:25,583
'Cause I'm not good enough?

273
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,250
No, it's not that...

274
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:30,250
It's just that I really
think I need to do this alone.

275
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:32,958
Please.

276
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:34,708
I'm sorry.

277
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,833
Please promise
you'll come back soon.

278
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:46,583
I'll be here waiting for you.

279
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:49,125
Okay.

280
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,791
Sergeant Miyafuji has escaped!

281
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,041
But how?

282
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,250
Impressive.

283
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:01,166
That idiot...!

284
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,500
What's wrong with her?

285
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,125
I hope headquarters
doesn't find out about this!

286
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:07,416
We need to bring
her back immediately.

287
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,000
Hello, this is the 501st.

288
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,791
Yes...

289
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:15,791
But, your Excellency, she's...

290
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:18,958
No, I understand completely.

291
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:20,875
Listen up...

292
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,875
Headquarters has commanded
us to shoot down Miyafuji.

293
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:43,333
I think that's everything...

294
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:44,666
Perrine, I need you to take care

295
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:46,583
of the Major
while we're out there.

296
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:48,291
Right.

297
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:49,750
Hold on a minute, Lynne.

298
00:16:49,833 --> 00:16:50,625
Yes?

299
00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,416
I'm gonna need you to stay here.

300
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,708
It's just for today...

301
00:16:53,791 --> 00:16:55,041
but I'm gonna need
you to stay behind

302
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,500
in confinement
in Yoshika's place.

303
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,041
Right.

304
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:03,541
What is it with
these witches from Fuso?

305
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,208
Major, are you okay...?

306
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,666
Do you need a doctor?

307
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:10,000
No, I'm okay...

308
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,750
So this is all because of her?

309
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:13,833
Yes, it's because
of Yoshika Miayfuji

310
00:17:13,916 --> 00:17:16,000
that the whole base
is in an uproar.

311
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:18,458
I know...

312
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,333
Perrine, I have a
favor to ask of you.

313
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:23,708
And, you're the only one
who can help me with this.

314
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:26,000
Oh... Right!

315
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:29,708
I think I was around
here somewhere.

316
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:52,041
Wait!

317
00:17:58,333 --> 00:17:59,250
They're over there.

318
00:17:59,333 --> 00:18:00,833
I can see them!
They're together!

319
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,458
Neuori...

320
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,875
That's the bastard
that shot the Major!

321
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:05,500
Wait!

322
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,583
What for?!

323
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,416
Look... What is that?

324
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,291
The Neuroi hive.

325
00:18:11,375 --> 00:18:14,458
Cool, I've never
seen that before,

326
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,625
so that's where they come from?

327
00:18:16,708 --> 00:18:17,958
Many of our allies
have attacked it

328
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,625
in order to try and destroy it.

329
00:18:20,708 --> 00:18:21,875
But damn it...

330
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,833
No one's ever been
able to get close enough.

331
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,000
Until now!
Yoshika's going inside!

332
00:18:26,083 --> 00:18:27,750
She's what?!

333
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,750
It's like a
whole hall of clouds!

334
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:36,541
She just went in.

335
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,791
I don't think anyone's
ever done that before.

336
00:18:38,875 --> 00:18:40,458
It's all part of their trap!

337
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:41,125
I'm going in!

338
00:18:41,208 --> 00:18:43,250
Get back over here!

339
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:45,625
I think we should wait awhile.

340
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,541
What... is this?

341
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,791
Is that... the core?

342
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:18,250
Umm

343
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,833
Is that Earth?

344
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:44,875
Sakamoto, no!

345
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,750
A Neuroi fragment?

346
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,375
Where... Where is that?!

347
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,375
Are you trying to
play a game with me?

348
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,125
Hey, wait up!

349
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,166
That's me...

350
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,625
She still hasn't come out yet.

351
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:26,750
Wait, come back!

352
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,583
It's the one from before.

353
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,666
Where's Yoshika?

354
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,583
She's not there. It was a trap!

355
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,250
Everyone, break!

356
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:35,541
Yes ma'am!

357
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,833
Look!

358
00:20:51,958 --> 00:20:54,458
Hey...! Where did you go?!

359
00:20:58,791 --> 00:20:59,791
What do I do?

360
00:20:59,875 --> 00:21:02,041
I've never seen
beams like this before!

361
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,708
This is bad.

362
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:04,500
Where's the other one?!

363
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,750
Just what is that thing?!

364
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,750
Is that a...?

365
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,333
It's a beam!

366
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,750
Is that thing a Neuroi, too?

367
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,416
It's really strong.

368
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,208
It took out the
Neuroi in one hit.

369
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,125
What is it?

370
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:32,166
I don't know.

371
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,041
That beam...

372
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,083
I've never seen power like that.

373
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,333
Yoshika!

374
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:40,958
Hold on!

375
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:49,833
Um, Do you think it'll fit?

376
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,750
Yeah, just a little bit further.

377
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:54,125
Right there. You got it.

378
00:21:57,625 --> 00:21:59,416
Looks like it's started.

379
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,791
Yoshika, are you okay?

380
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:03,791
Yeah.

381
00:22:03,875 --> 00:22:05,458
Did you see where
the Neuroi went?

382
00:22:05,541 --> 00:22:06,875
Sergeant, Miyafuji...!

383
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:10,125
You are detained for the
crime of absence without leave!

384
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:12,666
Return to base!

385
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:20,750
Hey look, someone's there.

386
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,083
Welcome back, Commander...

387
00:22:27,166 --> 00:22:29,125
Very good work.

388
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,291
It's that thing again.

389
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:28,666
In the depths of a conspiracy,
the girls' wings are clipped.

390
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:30,583
Will they ever
break free of the fear

391
00:24:30,666 --> 00:24:33,708
that binds them and
take to the skies again?

392
00:24:33,791 --> 00:24:37,000
Next time on Strike Witches:
"Into the Sky."
