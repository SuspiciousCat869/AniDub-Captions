1
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:39,208
It was the year 1939.

2
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:43,458
They appeared all over
the world without warning.

3
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,125
We called them 'Neuroi.'

4
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:04,208
Nobody knows where they
came from or what they want.

5
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:08,125
But the hell they brought
drove us all from our countries,

6
00:01:08,208 --> 00:01:12,958
from our cities... they
drove us from our homes.

7
00:01:16,666 --> 00:01:18,208
Mankind came up
with a new weapon

8
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:22,583
to fight the Neuroi and
began to stand and fight.

9
00:01:22,666 --> 00:01:24,916
The Striker Unit...
a device that heightens

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,416
natural magical ability,
the only thing capable

11
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,333
of combating the Neuroi.

12
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:32,791
This modern witches' broom
made individual flight possible,

13
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,000
but only for a select
few who posses the power.

14
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:38,791
A call went out to
witches across the world

15
00:01:38,875 --> 00:01:41,333
to lend their
skills to the battle.

16
00:01:42,416 --> 00:01:44,208
This elite task force
organized to fight

17
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:48,541
the Neuroi was named the
501st Joint Fighter Wing.

18
00:01:48,625 --> 00:01:51,250
But these young women
are known by another name.

19
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:54,458
Simply called ...
the Strike Witches

20
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:35,541
There it is...

21
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,541
Climb 15,000 at my
2 o'clock. In the clouds.

22
00:03:37,625 --> 00:03:39,208
Yes, Major...

23
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,291
All units engage the
Neuroi. Formation Bravo.

24
00:03:48,541 --> 00:03:51,000
Strike Witches... Attack, now!

25
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:42,666
Finish it off.

26
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:43,666
Copy.

27
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:45,208
Perrine... You're with me.

28
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,833
Right.

29
00:05:00,125 --> 00:05:01,541
School has ended
for the day girls.

30
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:05,083
Any students still on campus
should go home at this time.

31
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,458
Don't Yoshika... It's too scary!

32
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:16,708
Do you want me to
call the teacher?

33
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,750
No... I'm okay.

34
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,375
I can do this.

35
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:32,875
Yoshika!

36
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,750
That's enough... Get down here!

37
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:35,708
Not yet...

38
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:38,083
Just ... a little bit further.

39
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:41,708
Alright... almost there!

40
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,166
Be careful.

41
00:05:46,666 --> 00:05:48,958
Okay... You're
gonna be alright now.

42
00:05:52,208 --> 00:05:53,750
Yoshika!

43
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:57,875
Oh, Yoshika!

44
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,125
That was close.

45
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:03,708
Someone help me!

46
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:11,291
Hang on... I'll get the teacher.

47
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,833
Did she yell at you?

48
00:06:12,916 --> 00:06:15,666
Well, what's wrong with trying
to save a poor kittens life?

49
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,166
I suppose that's why
I like you so much...

50
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,375
You're always trying
to do things as

51
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,250
if you were
already grown-up...

52
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:26,208
Grandpa.

53
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:27,750
Hello!

54
00:06:27,833 --> 00:06:29,833
Michiko!

55
00:06:36,791 --> 00:06:38,208
That's amazing.

56
00:06:38,875 --> 00:06:40,291
I know...

57
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,125
Wow, that ship is huge!

58
00:06:45,208 --> 00:06:47,875
It's got to be the battleship
they said was coming.

59
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:48,625
Battleship?

60
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:50,416
Yeah.

61
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:54,708
A ship that's made only
for war... don't like it.

62
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:58,708
Because of your father?

63
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,833
He left when I was six...

64
00:07:01,916 --> 00:07:04,083
It's been really
hard without him.

65
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:07,333
Where are you going Daddy...?

66
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:11,166
You said that you'd take me to
my first day of school tomorrow.

67
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,250
I'm sorry Yoshika but I've
got important work to do...

68
00:07:14,333 --> 00:07:19,458
If I can succeed we'll finally
defeat the Neuroi... but...

69
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,083
When I'm finished...

70
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,875
I'll never leave you again.

71
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:23,916
Really...?

72
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,166
You're gonna stay
with me forever?

73
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,291
Yes, I promise.

74
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:35,375
Yoshika, know that you have
a great power inside of you

75
00:07:35,458 --> 00:07:37,750
just like your mother
and grandmother...

76
00:07:37,833 --> 00:07:39,041
Promise me when you grow up

77
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:41,541
you'll use that power
to protect everyone.

78
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,125
Okay... I promise.

79
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:48,666
That was the last time
I ever saw my dad.

80
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,958
What did come back
was his death certificate

81
00:07:51,041 --> 00:07:53,291
and a bag of his
personal effects...

82
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,375
three years later.

83
00:07:58,166 --> 00:07:59,208
They said his
cause of death

84
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,166
was 'classified
military information'

85
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:04,583
so we never found
out what happened...

86
00:08:04,666 --> 00:08:07,375
One thing I know for sure,
if it weren't for the war,

87
00:08:07,458 --> 00:08:10,125
my dad would be
home with me now.

88
00:08:12,333 --> 00:08:13,791
So that's the girl.

89
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,666
Yes... Yoshika Miyafuji.

90
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,000
She certainly doesn't look
like she's anything special.

91
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,041
Her academics are average...

92
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,041
Her athletic ability is average.

93
00:08:24,125 --> 00:08:27,291
The only place she seems
to excel is... cooking.

94
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:30,458
Do you really believe
she's our leading candidate?

95
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:32,125
Major Sakamoto...

96
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,500
What do we do now, huh?

97
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,500
Wait and see...

98
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,333
Michiko!

99
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:49,958
Hijikata!

100
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,458
Right!

101
00:08:55,291 --> 00:08:57,208
Michiko!

102
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,125
Michiko! Wake up

103
00:09:00,208 --> 00:09:04,041
Oh no! Michiko, no!

104
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,166
Yoshika... please it...
hurts so much.

105
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:09,166
Don't try to talk!

106
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,416
What's that...?

107
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,750
A healing spell...
one of the most powerful.

108
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,208
She's having
trouble controlling it.

109
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:40,791
My power...

110
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:44,083
Calm down Miyafuji...
concentrate.

111
00:09:45,916 --> 00:09:47,250
Relax and breathe into it.

112
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,375
Let the spell do the work.

113
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,208
You are in control of the magic.

114
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:53,458
I am in control.

115
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,500
Michiko!

116
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:06,958
She's going to be fine.

117
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:08,458
Mom...

118
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:11,708
We've closed the wound and
there shouldn't be any scarring.

119
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,291
Well that's good news.

120
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:15,000
Apparently you still
haven't figured out

121
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,666
how to control your powers...

122
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,750
Remember your feelings
mustn't control you.

123
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,291
I understand the
youthful impulse

124
00:10:23,375 --> 00:10:25,125
to want to help everyone...

125
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,333
But if you Îdon't learn how

126
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,041
to direct these
energies we possess...

127
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:31,250
You'll overextend and end
up paying with your life.

128
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:32,708
I'm sorry.

129
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,458
I just wanted...

130
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:37,500
I want to learn how to save
people's lives like you two do!

131
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,416
I know that I can do it.

132
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:45,000
Besides... I made a promise.

133
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,416
Don't lose heart.

134
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,041
Yeah...

135
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,541
Your natural talent
is incredible...

136
00:10:51,625 --> 00:10:52,916
Once you learn how to use it,

137
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,291
there's no way you won't
develop into a great witch.

138
00:10:55,375 --> 00:10:57,291
Wait... A witch?

139
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,125
And just who are you anyway?

140
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,916
Oh, I'm so sorry...

141
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,791
I forgot to introduce myself.

142
00:11:03,875 --> 00:11:05,916
I am a member
of an elite squad,

143
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,333
the 501st Joint Fighter Wing...

144
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,125
Also known as
the Strike Witches...

145
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,041
Major Mio Sakamoto.

146
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:14,583
Oh, hello.

147
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:15,833
She's the one who carried you

148
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:18,041
and Michiko back here
to the clinic, Yoshika.

149
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:19,333
Carried?

150
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,833
We've been searching
all over the globe

151
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:22,791
for witches with
great magical potential

152
00:11:22,875 --> 00:11:24,625
and a possible future with us.

153
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,166
I was able to witness
your powers first hand...

154
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:29,583
They are unfocused
but very powerful.

155
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,041
Thank you.

156
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,291
Now let's say we put
that power of yours

157
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,583
to work for us fighting
against the Neuroi.

158
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,625
Alright... huh?

159
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,041
Hold on!

160
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:44,166
Are you trying to get my
granddaughter into the military?

161
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,500
Military...? I don't want to...

162
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
Thank you but I plan
on taking over this clinic

163
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,791
when I graduate.

164
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:56,125
Well, taking over this clinic
is certainly a noble idea...

165
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,375
But there are people who
are more in need of your power

166
00:11:58,458 --> 00:12:00,458
than you'll ever
see at this place.

167
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,916
I never expected
you to just say 'yes'

168
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:08,000
to my offer without
thinking about it, however,

169
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:11,583
I just know somehow you'll
be coming with me in the end.

170
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,375
And just what makes
you so sure about that?

171
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,625
Hmm? Intuition.

172
00:12:17,416 --> 00:12:19,291
Those with gifts such
as yours are always

173
00:12:19,375 --> 00:12:22,666
led to where their power
is needed the most.

174
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,541
Okay... You can
find me at the port.

175
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:28,458
Hijikata.

176
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:30,083
Yes ma'am.

177
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,166
What's her deal...? Really!

178
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:41,541
They need my power...?

179
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,916
But... if I do what she wants,

180
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,416
I'll be part of that awful war.

181
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,583
Not in a million years!

182
00:12:53,333 --> 00:12:54,041
Mailman!

183
00:12:54,125 --> 00:12:55,291
Coming.

184
00:12:56,583 --> 00:12:58,416
Thank you very much mister!

185
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,583
Mom! Grandma!

186
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:09,083
How did we get
a letter from dad?

187
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,500
Does this mean that he
really didn't die... huh?

188
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:12,875
Try to calm down.

189
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,541
It appears to have
been sent from Britannia.

190
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,375
Why is it just showing up now?

191
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,583
Daddy...

192
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:24,750
There's another one.

193
00:13:24,833 --> 00:13:26,208
Isn't that...?!

194
00:13:26,291 --> 00:13:30,166
It's that woman...
Major Sakamoto.

195
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:34,458
Somehow the major knew my daddy.

196
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:58,166
So you're here...

197
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,333
See I told you that
you'd change your mind.

198
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:03,291
I'm glad you've decided to
come put your power to work.

199
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:04,541
No, I...

200
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:07,125
Don't worry...
It'll all be taken care of...

201
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,916
I'll see to it that
your enlistment

202
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,666
and school classes
are my top priority.

203
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,333
Hold on...

204
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:16,791
You see... I didn't come here
so that you could sign me up.

205
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:32,000
A letter from Dr. Miyafuji?

206
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:33,666
That's right...

207
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:37,333
I wanted to know how
well you knew my dad.

208
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:38,791
Well...

209
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,875
I do owe him my life.

210
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,375
Your father's
research is the reason

211
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:45,250
I'm in the position
that I'm in now.

212
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:47,833
Well then do you know
if my daddy is still alive?

213
00:14:47,916 --> 00:14:49,708
I'm sorry... I don't know

214
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:51,166
But I will look into it.

215
00:14:51,250 --> 00:14:53,416
You have to take me
along with you to Britannia!

216
00:14:53,500 --> 00:14:56,500
I need to find out what
happened to my dad, please.

217
00:15:01,958 --> 00:15:02,875
Glad to hear it.

218
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,000
Now then...

219
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,708
The ship leaves tomorrow.

220
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,708
Thank you so much!

221
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:11,291
Okay, now about
your enlistment papers.

222
00:15:11,375 --> 00:15:12,625
Forget it!

223
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:15,375
I'll never help you
with your war!

224
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,125
Settle down. Okay.

225
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,250
Good bye Yoshika!!

226
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:27,000
Good luck! Bye!

227
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:30,208
Michiko, I'll miss you
so much, take care 'kay!

228
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:33,916
Stay safe dear,
and be sure to write!

229
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,000
Yoshika.

230
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:41,083
Mama... Grandma...

231
00:15:41,166 --> 00:15:45,250
I'll be back!!

232
00:15:57,833 --> 00:16:00,083
So, enjoying your
time on the Akagi?

233
00:16:00,166 --> 00:16:01,166
Oh um yes...

234
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:03,000
it's very comfortable.

235
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,500
Good for you...

236
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:07,375
but you'll only find that
while you're aboard this ship.

237
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,708
I'm sure you've heard what
Britannia is like nowadays...

238
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:13,791
The Neuroi have taken
over the whole continent.

239
00:16:13,875 --> 00:16:16,625
It's the front line in
our battle against them...

240
00:16:17,625 --> 00:16:20,041
Britannia used to
be so beautiful

241
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:22,416
Are you only interested
in going there

242
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:26,083
so you can find your father?

243
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,625
Not just that.

244
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:29,791
There are a lot of people in
Britannia who need help, right?

245
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:32,541
Yes... far too many.

246
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,333
Then I... should protect them...

247
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:37,333
If anybody is wounded
or sick I need to use

248
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,625
these powers of mine to help
them survive as best I can.

249
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,958
I made a promise to my dad.

250
00:16:45,458 --> 00:16:46,500
Major Sakamoto...

251
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,750
Tell me anything
I can do to help.

252
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:51,083
Cleaning, laundry,
I don't care what it is!

253
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,166
That's the way.

254
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,750
Good girl!

255
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,708
Excuse me.

256
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,583
Check, one, two...

257
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:30,625
Miyafuji, are you on deck...?
Wait for me there.

258
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:33,125
I have something
I want to show you.

259
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:34,958
Show me?

260
00:17:57,708 --> 00:17:58,916
Major Sakamoto...

261
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,750
now commencing
flight training Alpha.

262
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,958
So cool.

263
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,833
Major Sakamoto!

264
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:57,875
What'd 'ya think?

265
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,583
That was so amazing...!

266
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:02,541
You were flying around
so fast all over the sky...!

267
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,916
It's like you were a bird!

268
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,583
A bird, huh?

269
00:19:07,666 --> 00:19:10,291
But birds aren't nearly
as fast as we are...

270
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:12,333
We're part of the
five hundred and first.

271
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,541
We're the Strike Witches!

272
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:17,750
The Strike Witches.

273
00:19:17,833 --> 00:19:19,750
And our magic broom
is right here.

274
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,250
You are looking
at the Striker Unit.

275
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:23,791
The invention of...

276
00:19:23,875 --> 00:19:28,416
...None other than Dr. Miyafuji.

277
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,125
My dad invented these?

278
00:19:31,208 --> 00:19:33,250
The invention of the
Striker Unit made it possible

279
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:36,416
for us to finally fight
back against the Neuroi.

280
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:38,166
Without your father's invention,

281
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:43,375
the world would be
completely destroyed by now.

282
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,041
The entire human race
owes Dr. Miyafuji

283
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,750
a deep debt of gratitude.

284
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,583
My father?

285
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:53,291
Want to try it on?

286
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,708
Your father was the one
who invented it after all ...

287
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,000
It's not going to bite you.

288
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,958
I think I'll pass on it.

289
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,458
I see...

290
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:16,041
Now I understand the work
that my dad was doing... but...

291
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,250
I won't help with war.

292
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,750
Hey, welcome back!

293
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,416
As usual, the two of you

294
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,458
have a complete
disregard for regulations...

295
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,791
We're on standby alert...

296
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:50,791
and here you are
wearing next to nothing.

297
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,041
Grow up.

298
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:53,416
The lieutenant colonel
gave us permission...

299
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,958
Besides, operation says

300
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,625
we won't see another Neuroi
till oh eight hundred...

301
00:20:57,708 --> 00:20:59,083
Or maybe...

302
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:02,000
Maybe you're frustrated
'cause I'm so tempting.

303
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,583
Yeah.

304
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:05,916
Or maybe you're mad because no
one wants to see you like that?

305
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,958
That is totally
not true... and besides,

306
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:12,041
Major Sakamoto is going
to be back any minute now...

307
00:21:12,125 --> 00:21:14,541
I'll be certain to put in my
report how much time

308
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,458
the two of you spent laying
around doing absolutely nothing.

309
00:21:17,541 --> 00:21:19,375
You're so tragic!

310
00:21:19,458 --> 00:21:21,375
Yeah... Especially in the chest.

311
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,041
You just shut your mouth...!

312
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:26,333
It's not like you have
anything to brag about either.

313
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,375
Neuroi.

314
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:32,041
It can't be. It's much too soon.

315
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,875
I still can't see it.

316
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:39,791
Brittania is still about
half a day away at least...

317
00:21:39,875 --> 00:21:41,500
Patience Miyafuji.

318
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,625
But I've already been on
this ship for over a month.

319
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,708
Once we get to Brittania,
we'll go to your dad's address,

320
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,625
and then after that-

321
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:53,000
What is it?

322
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:58,333
Neuroi.

323
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:01,250
Stations!

324
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,833
12 o'clock! Distance 4000!!

325
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,083
Contact confirmed!

326
00:22:13,166 --> 00:22:14,916
This is not a drill.

327
00:22:16,375 --> 00:22:18,333
So, that's a Neuroi.

328
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:25,500
Miyafuji...

00:22:25,583 --> 00:22:26,750
It's too dangerous for
you to be up here now...

330
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:28,291
Get below deck to the Sick Bay.

331
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:30,791
I... Okay.

332
00:22:46,708 --> 00:22:48,458
Where's my dad?

333
00:24:24,083 --> 00:24:27,916
The roar of the enemy shook
her young heart to the core;

334
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,583
will she succumb to her
fear or face the enemy...?
