00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:17,625
[gasps]

2
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:20,083
[MADOKA groans]
That hurt.

3
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,375
Thank you, it's beautiful!

4
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,750
But how did you know
I wanted it?

5
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:31,041
Well uh. I think
it was Santa, you know?

6
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,666
[gasps]

7
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,000
[CHIHIRO]
Wow, Santa is the best!

8
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:37,291
[MADOKA]
Right? He's so amazing!

9
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,250
[vacuum hums]

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:41,083
[CHIHIRO]
Wow. Just wow!

11
00:00:41,166 --> 00:00:42,208
[KEIICHIRO] It sounds
like Chihiro is enjoying

12
00:00:42,291 --> 00:00:44,250
his Christmas
present from "Santa."

13
00:00:44,333 --> 00:00:45,958
Yes, I suppose.

14
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:47,833
Most young boys
would ask for video games

15
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:49,500
or something similar.

16
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,583
[MADOKA] So imagine
my surprise when I found

17
00:00:57,666 --> 00:01:00,458
all that stuff marked in
the catalogue by his bed.

18
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:03,791
Yes, his interests are certainly
different from most boys.

19
00:01:03,875 --> 00:01:05,583
They are less fun.

20
00:01:05,666 --> 00:01:07,500
[phone chirping]
[gasps]

21
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,708
[CHIHIRO]
Hello? Hey, Hino!

22
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,250
Um. Come play video games?

23
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:15,083
I'm so sorry, but I can't.

24
00:01:15,166 --> 00:01:17,500
I'm busy deep cleaning
the house!

25
00:01:17,583 --> 00:01:19,708
Santa Claus created
some kind of monster.

26
00:01:19,791 --> 00:01:21,875
Yeah, a cleaning monster.

27
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,083
Komiya's too busy.
He's doing housework.

28
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:57,791
What, seriously?

29
00:02:57,875 --> 00:03:00,083
I can't believe
he's working today.

30
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:01,791
[AMAHARA]
Man, this sucks.

31
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:03,625
I wanted to play
my new game together.

32
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:04,833
His house is huge.

33
00:03:04,916 --> 00:03:06,375
Cleaning that beast
is gonna take a while.

34
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:07,875
More like forever.

35
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,458
[AMAHARA] Hey! He can play when
he's done cleaning, right?

36
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,666
[CHIHIRO]
You wanna help?

37
00:03:13,750 --> 00:03:15,958
Yeah, it's a lot of work
to do all by yourself.

38
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,458
For sure! And teamwork
makes the dream work!

39
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,541
Come on.
Let's finish up together.

40
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,500
After that, it's game time!

41
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,416
[chuckles]
Okay!

42
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:27,083
Is Hino coming, too?

43
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,541
He had to run home
for something,

44
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,250
but he should be here soon.

45
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:34,166
That's cool.
Well, better put these on.

46
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,541
[BOTH]
Ehhh...

47
00:03:35,625 --> 00:03:37,041
You've gotta wear an apron.

48
00:03:37,125 --> 00:03:39,833
Otherwise you could get dirt
all over yourself, you know?

49
00:03:39,916 --> 00:03:42,041
Thanks, but frills
make me itchy.

50
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:43,583
That's ridiculous!
I don't want you

51
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,000
to ruin your clothes.

52
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,916
But it could
ruin our dignity.

53
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,333
It's okay. Who needs
a little thing like dignity

54
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,125
when you have the
enlightenment that only

55
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:52,458
a clean house could provide?

56
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,708
[AMAHARA, TAKEI]
Uh, we do!

57
00:03:53,791 --> 00:03:55,125
[doorbell buzzes]

58
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,750
[HINO]
Sorry I'm late!

59
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,000
[AMAHARA] Shut your face!
If you laugh, I'll kill you!

60
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:06,000
So violent! I would never
ever do such a mean thing.

61
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,916
[AMAHARA] Whatever!
You have to wear one, too!

62
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,500
Oh? Do I?

63
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,291
Good thing I brought one
from home, huh?

64
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,083
Too bad it doesn't have frills.

65
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,166
[BOTH]
No fair!

66
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:17,666
[HINO] Right.
Let's do this thing.

67
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:19,000
Where do you want us to start?

68
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:22,916
--Well, mind dusting?
--[MADOKA] Count us in!

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,791
We'll both
help out as well!

70
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,875
Absolutely. Leave the
heavy lifting to us.

71
00:04:27,958 --> 00:04:29,250
Wow, really?

72
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,458
Yep!

73
00:04:30,541 --> 00:04:32,250
Well then!

74
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,041
[CHIHIRO] Organize Junk
Mountain, or I toss it.

75
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,166
[door squeaks, slams]

76
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,583
[CHIHIRO] Keiichiro, could you
please move some things for me?

77
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:45,958
--[KEIICHIRO] Sure.
--[HINO] I'll help!

78
00:04:46,041 --> 00:04:46,916
[CHIHIRO]
All right!

79
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,041
[MADOKA]
They left me alone.

80
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:56,583
[vacuum hums]

81
00:04:56,666 --> 00:04:58,083
[KEIICHIRO]
Pudding Power, Activate!

82
00:04:58,166 --> 00:04:59,583
[CHIHIRO]
Stop for a second!

83
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,541
You have to dust off
the top before you move it.

84
00:05:01,625 --> 00:05:03,875
Oh, good to know.

85
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:05,625
You have to let
the solution soak first,

86
00:05:05,708 --> 00:05:07,708
--and then scrub it.
--Uh, right.

87
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:09,208
[AMAHARA]
Let the good times roll!

88
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,916
[CHIHIRO]
Do that part last!

89
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,833
Hey, this isn't art time!

90
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,250
[CHIHIRO] You have to
clean the windows

91
00:05:14,333 --> 00:05:15,833
from the corners to the middle.
When it's half-way dry,

92
00:05:15,916 --> 00:05:17,625
then you can wipe it
with the cloth!

93
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,833
[HINO]
Augh. You're so bossy.

94
00:05:19,916 --> 00:05:21,416
We're never gonna
finish, are we?

95
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:23,500
Yeah, it's a lot more
work than I thought.

96
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:25,958
I am so over this.
I'm calling for backup.

97
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,208
[TAKEI, AMAHARA]
Like who?

98
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:29,000
[doorbell buzzes]

99
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:30,583
[MIYAKO]
Merry Christmas!

100
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,583
[CHIHIRO] Hi Miyako.
Can I help you?

101
00:05:32,666 --> 00:05:34,166
I got a text from Hino.

102
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,375
He said you might need
my help cleaning today.

103
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:39,291
--Did he now?
--Hey, you're here!

104
00:05:39,375 --> 00:05:41,416
Hello there!
Sorry I'm late.

105
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:44,250
Oh, my! What is that
you're wearing?

106
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:46,708
--It wasn't our idea!
--They're so silly!

107
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,625
There! Now you look perfect!

108
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,083
[laughs]

109
00:05:52,166 --> 00:05:53,875
Shut your face!

110
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,916
So, uh, you sure
you wanna help us clean?

111
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,375
Yep! Just leave it to me!

112
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:03,208
I was Chihiro's
very first disciple!

113
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:05,333
But now the student
becomes the teacher!

114
00:06:05,416 --> 00:06:07,208
[HINO, AMAHARA, TAKEI]
Oooh!

115
00:06:07,291 --> 00:06:10,875
[MIYAKO] Behold! Proper floor
cleaning techniques!

116
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,958
Don't forget to
dilute that first.

117
00:06:13,041 --> 00:06:15,750
That's right!

118
00:06:15,833 --> 00:06:17,375
[CHIHIRO] You might wanna
wring it out better.

119
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,833
[MIYAKO]
Okay!

120
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:22,041
You need to move backwards
when wiping the floor.

121
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,291
[MIYAKO]
Oh yeah.

122
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:24,958
[CHIHIRO] And wipe with
the grain of the boards.

123
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:26,083
Yes! Right!

124
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:27,333
[CHIHIRO]
It'll warp if it stays wet,

125
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:28,791
so dry it immediately.

126
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,208
[MIYAKO]
Of course!

127
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,666
[MIYAKO screams]

128
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,750
[CHIHIRO] Stay right there,
I'll go get some towels!

129
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:36,666
[MIYAKO cries out]

130
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,625
[MIYAKO]
What was I thinking?

131
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,625
I'm the worst
cleaning disciple ever.

132
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,083
[TAKEI, AMAHARA, HINO] Aw,
don't be so hard on yourself!

133
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:47,333
How's it going?

134
00:06:47,416 --> 00:06:49,333
We're good here.
We can handle this part,

135
00:06:49,416 --> 00:06:51,916
so if you have something
else to do, go ahead.

136
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,583
Right? We've got this.

137
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:56,041
Oh, yes! I was
just a little rusty!

138
00:06:56,125 --> 00:06:57,375
But now I'm ready for action,

139
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,708
and together
we'll be unstoppable!

140
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,291
'Kay! I'll leave it
to you, then!

141
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,583
--[MIYAKO] Thanks!
--[HINO] Cool.

142
00:07:03,666 --> 00:07:05,000
[TAKEI]
I'll get some clean water.

143
00:07:05,083 --> 00:07:06,833
[AMAHARA] And I'll
keep drying the floor.

144
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:09,125
[MIYAKO]
Sounds like a good plan!

145
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,541
[HINO, AMAHARA, TAKEI]
Finally.

146
00:07:25,625 --> 00:07:27,875
Great job! Everything
looks wonderful!

147
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:29,375
Thanks a lot, you guys!

148
00:07:29,458 --> 00:07:32,000
Sure! Tomorrow we can
play my game, right?

149
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,541
Yep! Right after
I do laundry!

150
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:37,166
And I still have to polish the
silverware in the kitchen, too!

151
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:39,833
--You mean there's more?
--No way!

152
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,583
Hey, where's Madoka hiding?

153
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,541
[KEIICHIRO] Well, once he
finished with your task,

154
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,291
I sent him to organize
his workroom.

155
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,666
He's the only one really
fit to clean in there.

156
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:49,500
The fact that it also
kept him out of the way

157
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,333
all day is just an added bonus.

158
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,125
Wow, Keiichiro,
you're a genius!

159
00:07:53,208 --> 00:07:56,791
He's not genius. He's
a demon! A demon, I say!

160
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,583
Thanks for all your
hard work today!

161
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:01,041
I made these
treats just for you!

162
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,083
[CHIHIRO]
Did you ruin my kitchen?

163
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:06,000
[MADOKA]
Chi's face is super scary!

164
00:08:06,083 --> 00:08:09,041
Hey, now, relax. I cleaned up
after myself this time.

165
00:08:09,125 --> 00:08:10,666
[CHIHIRO]
What?

166
00:08:13,125 --> 00:08:14,250
He sure did.

167
00:08:14,333 --> 00:08:16,291
It must be some kind
of Christmas miracle!

168
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,125
There, see?

169
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,041
That's what you get
for underestimating me!

170
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,375
When I put my mind to it,
I can do anything!

171
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,750
[MIYAKO] Wow Madoka,
you're truly an inspiration!

172
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:27,791
[MADOKA]
Oh stop, but not really.

173
00:08:27,875 --> 00:08:29,166
[CHIHIRO grunts]

174
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:31,625
Throwing it all away
is not cleaning!

175
00:08:31,708 --> 00:08:33,166
Ow!

176
00:08:40,083 --> 00:08:42,875
[CHIHIRO] I expected that
to take a whole lot longer.

177
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,333
It was fun having
everyone help out though.

178
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:47,500
More fun than doing it
all by yourself.

179
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,041
Yeah.

180
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,625
Well, now you have
time for a proper rest.

181
00:08:51,708 --> 00:08:53,625
Usually we clean
on New Year's Day,

182
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:56,375
but thanks to your eagerness
we're a bit ahead of schedule.

183
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,958
School is out, so why
not take a vacation?

184
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:01,666
Huh? A vacation?

185
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:04,541
[MADOKA] Exactly. We could
go somewhere fun.

186
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,541
Isn't that what
school holidays are for?

187
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,208
I actually got
the idea from Hino.

188
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,125
[CHIHIRO] Why do you guys
text so much? It's weird.

189
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,250
You don't have to
listen to him, you know!

190
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:14,333
Look, don't force yourself.

191
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,208
I know you hate
leaving this place.

192
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:18,458
[MADOKA]
I'm not forcing myself.

193
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:20,958
I want to
go somewhere together!

194
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:22,583
Pretty please?

195
00:09:22,666 --> 00:09:27,750
Uh, okay. But only because
you're so desperate.

196
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:29,375
[MADOKA]
You mean excited!

197
00:09:34,166 --> 00:09:36,166
[HINO]
Check out all the snow!

198
00:09:37,666 --> 00:09:39,541
[HINO] Hey Keiichiro!
Are we there yet?

199
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,750
Are we there yet?

200
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,458
Shouldn't be long now.
A half hour at most.

201
00:09:43,541 --> 00:09:45,125
I'm so happy
we all get to ring in

202
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,708
the new year together!

203
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,166
Right?

204
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,666
And your family
was really okay

205
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
with you coming, Hino?

206
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,708
Of course they were.
Our house is crowded anyway.

207
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,416
[MIYAKO]
I see!

208
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,250
Hey. You're awfully
quiet back there, Chi.

209
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:00,083
Are you okay?

210
00:10:01,541 --> 00:10:04,583
[CHIHIRO] I'm just worried.
Now that I think about it,

211
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:07,916
what if I didn't
lock up the trash cans?

212
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,708
[HINO] Seriously? It's trash.
Pretty sure it's safe.

213
00:10:10,791 --> 00:10:11,666
[CHIHIRO]
That's what you think!

214
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,333
What if animals
get inside it?

215
00:10:13,416 --> 00:10:14,708
[HINO] You worry
like an old lady!

216
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,750
We're on vacation.
Relax already!

217
00:10:25,166 --> 00:10:28,791
[BOTH gasp, chuckle]

218
00:10:28,875 --> 00:10:31,208
--It's so cabin-y!
--Yeah, it looks so real!

219
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,541
Maybe because
it's a real cabin?

220
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,416
[BOTH laugh]

221
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,708
[gasp in awe]

222
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,125
[CHIHIRO, HINO] A woodstove!
Check out the attic!

223
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:42,958
And there's a <i>kotatsu</i> !

224
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:45,458
Wow, it's just like
a real life cabin!

225
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,125
I already said that.

226
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:48,541
[MIYAKO]
This is pretty exciting.

227
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,458
I've never been
here before either.

228
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:52,333
[MADOKA] It's been
a while for me, too.

229
00:10:52,416 --> 00:10:55,083
Although Chiyo and I came here
a lot when we were younger.

230
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:57,250
It's been a while?

231
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:00,500
So. We should
probably clean it up then!

232
00:11:00,583 --> 00:11:02,333
[chuckles]
Sorry but the caretaker

233
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,291
already beat you to it.

234
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,708
[CHIHIRO]
Right, of course.

235
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,208
Don't be sad!

236
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:11,333
[HINO]
Chill out!

237
00:11:11,416 --> 00:11:13,041
Didn't we come here
to have fun?

238
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,041
I bet you can't even
make a snowball!

239
00:11:15,125 --> 00:11:17,125
We'll see about that!

240
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,291
It really was a good
idea to bring Hino along.

241
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,166
[CHIHIRO, HINO laugh]

242
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,958
[CHIHIRO]
Wait up!

243
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:30,875
[CHIHIRO]
A pond?

244
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:34,458
[HINO] Whoa,
I think it's frozen solid!

245
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:35,833
Will it break?

246
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,666
Don't worry, it's safe.

247
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:40,833
[KEIICHIRO] It looks like the
caretaker cleaned it off for us.

248
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:42,958
And there should be
some ice skates here.

249
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:44,416
Would you like to
give it a try?

250
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,666
Yes, that sounds fun!

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:48,208
[HINO]
Heck yeah! Let's do it!

252
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:51,500
Uh, what if I don't really
know how to skate though?

253
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,125
Well. Then it looks like I
get to be the teacher today!

254
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:58,208
Don't worry, with my help you'll
be a pro in no time at all!

255
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,250
[CHIHIRO]
Okay.

256
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,375
[CHIHIRO] I can't.
I seriously can't.

257
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:06,916
[KEIICHIRO] Hey Chihiro,
I think I might

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,416
rename you Bambi.
Smile, please!

259
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,875
Come on, try pushing
with one of your legs.

260
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:14,625
[CHIHIRO]
I can't do it!

261
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:15,833
[yells]

262
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:18,208
--Good luck!
--Hino, you're the worst!

263
00:12:18,291 --> 00:12:20,583
I'm gonna die!
I'm gonna die!

264
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,375
[KEIICHIRO] Well, at least
you'll look adorable doing it!

265
00:12:22,458 --> 00:12:24,416
Stop that!

266
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,166
[MIYAKO] Don't stop,
you're doing great!

267
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,625
[CHIHIRO]
No I'm not!

268
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:31,833
Hey, Chi, you're
looking good out there!

269
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,750
Hey, Madoka,
aren't you gonna skate?

270
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:38,666
Uh, hmmm.
I, uh, you know,

271
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,083
as his guardian it's
more my job to supervise.

272
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,583
Oooh. Heh.

273
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:46,541
[MADOKA yells]

274
00:12:46,625 --> 00:12:49,708
[MADOKA] No. No, no,
no, no, no. Aah-ha-ha.

275
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,541
Look at him.
He's pathetic.

276
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,833
[MADOKA]
You're one to talk! Whoa!

277
00:12:53,916 --> 00:13:01,333
Keiichiro,
you are a demon!

278
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:04,250
Okay. I'll at least be
a better skater than Madoka!

279
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,125
My!

280
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:06,208
[HINO]
Ha!

281
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:08,458
Hino, I'll get you for this!

282
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:12,083
[CHIHIRO yells]

283
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,458
I got some great shots!

284
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,375
I hope he's
careful out there.

285
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,125
He just needs some practice.

286
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,500
Plus he has
Hino to help him out,

287
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:22,041
so why don't you
go have some fun?

288
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:27,000
Yeah. Well, um.
I was just wondering.

289
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,833
You see, I've always
wanted to learn

290
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,583
how to skate backwards
like you do.

291
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:34,750
So, if it's not
too much trouble,

292
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:37,875
could you maybe give me
some pointers? Uh, please?

293
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:40,625
It's not that difficult
once you get the hang of it.

294
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:44,083
I could probably teach
you... if you want me to.

295
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:48,000
[MIYAKO]
Yes!

296
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:55,875
[MADOKA] That's it. I'm never
skating again as long as I live.

297
00:13:55,958 --> 00:13:58,000
I think I actually
skate better than you do!

298
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,333
Such a braggart.

299
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:03,416
Ooh! I'm starving!
Look, a hot pot!

300
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,250
[CHIHIRO] What the--?
How did it get there?

301
00:14:05,333 --> 00:14:08,333
Well, the caretaker
does a lot around here.

302
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:10,000
Like making up all the beds,

303
00:14:10,083 --> 00:14:12,583
bringing in wood to start
the fire in the stove,

304
00:14:12,666 --> 00:14:14,833
and folding the bathroom
tissue to a neat point.

305
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,541
Sounds like a lotta work.

306
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:17,958
What's weird is
I never actually

307
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:19,250
see any of it getting done.

308
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:22,291
Whoa cool, like some
kind of ninja butler!

309
00:14:22,375 --> 00:14:24,541
[CHIHIRO] Right! I'll finish
prepping dinner!

310
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,666
--No, stop right there!
--I...

311
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,416
Look Chihiro,
this is your vacation.

You're supposed to be relaxing!

You just sit right here
and leave the rest to me!

--You sure?
--Don't worry.

We put these in once
the water boils, right?

320
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,416
Uh huh, but you gotta
take the kelp out first.

321

Let's hurry this up!
I wanna stuff my face already!

Trust me, you can
dump it all in there

and it'll cook fine!

For sure, and there's...

330
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:13,416
Um, the kelp,
take the kelp out.

331
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,208
[HINO]
I'm sort of a pro at this.

332
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,208
And you have to
skim the water.

he seem more stressed?

348
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:56,916
More like
he seems relentless.

349
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,208
Try all you want,
but you can't

350
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,958
force the guy to take a break.

351
00:16:00,041 --> 00:16:01,958
If he wants to
do it so much, let him.

352
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:05,750
I can't. He's always working
so hard for everyone else.

I wanted to wait
on him, you know?

Trust me on this one.

You really wanna know the
secret to making him happy?

Hey, um.

Since you're up, could I
please have some tea?

Oh, me too, please!

371
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,708
I guess I've just
gotten so used to the tea

372
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:45,791
you always make. I can't
seem to relax without it.

373
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:48,166
[MIYAKO] Yes, and try as I
might, my tea never seems

00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,958
to be as good as yours, Chihiro!

00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:56,583
[CHIHIRO] Okay. I suppose
I don't mind this one time.

Thanks for your hard work.

start on the dishes next.

[KEIICHIRO]
Yes, I agree.

386
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,541
[MADOKA] Well, this seems
like the perfect time

387
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,958
for a little drink.

388
00:17:25,041 --> 00:17:27,541
Yeah? Yeah?

Great company, of course.

Hm-hm-hmm!

[MADOKA] I think you're
a bit underage, Hino.

393
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,333
[KEIICHIRO] Do you want us to
get in trouble with Chihiro?

at the sunrise together.

468
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:19,708
[CHIHIRO] I also prepared
some food for today.

469
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,708
[gasps]

470
00:21:22,791 --> 00:21:25,291
Now I feel bad.
I ordered food.

471
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,666
[MADOKA]
I blame you, Keiichiro.

472
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:28,875
You're usually so good
at organizing things.

473
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:32,458
[CHIHIRO]
And there's even more.

474
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:34,166
I found some rice cake
soup already made

475
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,333
back in the kitchen.

476
00:21:35,416 --> 00:21:37,500
It was the ninja butler!

477
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:46,541
What should we do?

478
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,208
Brace yourselves,
'cause we're about to get fat!

479
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:51,250
[ALL]
Right.

480
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,958
[KEIICHIRO] Well then. Let's
commemorate our pre-fatness!

481
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,750
Everybody ready?

482
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:01,250
We should take another photo
after for comparison!

483
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:03,375
[MIYAKO] Or you know,
we could just skip that part!

484
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:05,833
[KEIICHIRO] All right!
Everyone say "cheese"!

485
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,083
[beeping]

486
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:10,083
[camera shutter clicks]

487
00:23:50,833 --> 00:23:52,416
[KEIICHIRO] I spoke
with Chihiro earlier.

488
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:54,500
He said you have an
embarrassing photo of me.

489
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,500
Is that true?

490
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:56,958
[MADOKA]
I have my own trump card!

491
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,250
[KEIICHIRO] What if
I traded you for it?

492
00:23:58,333 --> 00:23:59,541
[MADOKA]
An album of kitty photos?

493
00:23:59,625 --> 00:24:01,125
You've got a deal!

494
00:24:01,208 --> 00:24:02,916
[KEIICHIRO] Where on Earth
did you get this picture?

495
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:04,791
[MADOKA]
Hmm, I can't remember.

496
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,916
Aw, this black cat
is so adorable!

497
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,291
[KEIICHIRO]
You mean Kuromame?

498
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,916
[MADOKA] Wait a second,
how do you know its name?

499
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:11,416
[KEIICHIRO]
Um, well.

500
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:12,916
Don't forget to
tune in next time for

501
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,666
"One Good Turn
Deserves Another"!

502
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:16,208
Remember,
you should be watching!

503
00:24:16,291 --> 00:24:17,875
[MADOKA] Hey,
don't change the subject!

504
00:24:17,958 --> 00:24:19,666
[KEIICHIRO] I don't know
what you mean.
