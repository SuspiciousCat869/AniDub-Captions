1
00:00:11,416 --> 00:00:13,708
[HINO groans]
I hate taking out the trash.

2
00:00:15,041 --> 00:00:16,708
It's a nice day,
but we gotta clean up

3
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:18,750
sandwich wrappers
and crumpled notes.

4
00:00:18,833 --> 00:00:21,625
I wanna get this over with
so we can play before sunset.

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,375
But it's so much fun
to tidy up the classroom!

6
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,125
I love wiping the
dirt off the floor

7
00:00:26,208 --> 00:00:27,500
and washing all the windows.

8
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:30,125
Oh, and cleaning off the
desks! It's so relaxing!

9
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:31,500
You're a weird kid.

10
00:00:31,583 --> 00:00:32,833
I just mopped there!

11
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:33,875
[BOYS]
I see London...

12
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:35,083
[HINO]
Just a few more things to do

13
00:00:35,166 --> 00:00:36,625
and we'll have enough
time for dodgeball!

14
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:38,208
You mean the field's
open this time?

15
00:00:38,291 --> 00:00:39,916
[gasps]

16
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,000
[grunts]

17
00:00:41,083 --> 00:00:43,250
[CHIHIRO yells]

18
00:00:43,333 --> 00:00:44,958
[gasps] Hey!

19
00:00:45,041 --> 00:00:47,208
[GIRL A screams]
Teacher!

20
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:52,041
[MADOKA] A sprain? How are
you feeling, Chihiro?

21
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:53,875
It's not that big of a deal.

22
00:00:53,958 --> 00:00:56,083
It hurts a little bit,
but I think I can walk.

23
00:00:56,166 --> 00:00:57,916
[KEIICHIRO]
You should take it easy.

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,250
If you don't stay
off of your feet,

25
00:00:59,333 --> 00:01:01,333
you may injure your
ankle permanently.

26
00:01:01,416 --> 00:01:02,708
Fortunately, it's the weekend.

27
00:01:02,791 --> 00:01:05,166
so you'll have more than
enough time to recover.

28
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:06,458
I can't! Who's gonna cook--

29
00:01:06,541 --> 00:01:08,625
[MADOKA] Chin up!
There's no need to worry.

30
00:01:10,708 --> 00:01:12,041
While we wait for
your footsie to heal,

31
00:01:12,125 --> 00:01:13,791
I'll take care of it all!

32
00:01:13,875 --> 00:01:16,416
You're not qualified to
maintain a functioning home.

33
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,041
[gasps] You're so cruel!

34
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,583
[KEIICHIRO]
When one wants to begin recovery

35
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:53,500
on a sprained ankle,
the most important thing

36
00:02:53,583 --> 00:02:55,541
to remember is to add RICE.

37
00:02:55,625 --> 00:02:57,583
Rest with an R,


38
00:02:57,666 --> 00:03:00,541
Icing is our I,


39
00:03:00,625 --> 00:03:03,333
Compression: the C,


40
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:06,750
and elevation: the E.


41
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,750
"Rice Therapy" is
one of the best ways

42
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:10,583
to treat a soft tissue injury.

43
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:12,291
Icing should be done
in approximately

44
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:13,500
--20 minute intervals.
--[MADOKA] Wa-hoo!

45
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:16,291
[CHIHIRO] Keiichiro,
I'm sorry to interrupt.

46
00:03:16,375 --> 00:03:18,458
It's just, how can
I focus on relaxing

47
00:03:18,541 --> 00:03:20,333
when that genius thinks
it's a good idea

48
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:22,083
to mop the floor
before sweeping?

49
00:03:22,166 --> 00:03:24,791
I suggest we ignore him
until he exhausts himself.

50
00:03:24,875 --> 00:03:27,583
[CHIHIRO] He's way too hyper!
That could take hours!

51
00:03:27,666 --> 00:03:29,583
[sighs]

52
00:03:29,666 --> 00:03:31,208
What have I done?

53
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,375
[MADOKA]
It's time for dinner!

54
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,791
I'm not trying to nitpick you,
but why so many sweets?

55
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:45,208
[MADOKA]
Well, it's funny--

56
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,166
I decided to make
dinner for us tonight,

57
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:48,833
but when I started
thinking about it,

58
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:50,916
I realized dessert
recipes are all I know.

59
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,500
[CHIHIRO] Why didn't you just
come to me for advice, then?

60
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,500
What'd you do to my kitchen?

61
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,041
Nothing much.

62
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,625
With the flour,
it's a winter wonderland.

63
00:04:00,708 --> 00:04:02,750
[CHIHIRO]
I should've known!

64
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:04,291
That settles it.

65
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:07,416
Starting tomorrow, I'm taking
over all the cooking again.

66
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,166
It's not that serious
of an injury, anyway.

67
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,666
[MADOKA]
Oh, no, you don't.

68
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,500
It's important that you
take the time you need

69
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,625
to heal now so it won't
come back to bite you later.

70
00:04:15,708 --> 00:04:16,833
[CHIHIRO]
The house will be a wreck before

71
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
the weekend is over,
and we're gonna die

72
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,250
because you can't
cook real food!

73
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,000
I've got it all under control.

74
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,291
I didn't tell you about
the ace up my sleeve.

75
00:04:24,375 --> 00:04:25,666
[CHIHIRO]
Mm?

76
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:34,041
How are you? A sprained
ankle's no joke!

77
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,291
[CHIHIRO] Thank you for coming,
but I'm feeling okay!

78
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,375
This is the perfect time

79
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,458
to test the skills
she's learned!

80
00:04:39,541 --> 00:04:40,541
Master Chef in the house!

81
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:42,333
[MADOKA]
Amazing!

82
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:46,083
[CHIHIRO]
Uh, thank you.

83
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,625
I have to say,
I feel really guilty

84
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:48,916
about not being able to help.

85
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,125
There's no need for that!

86
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:51,791
I consider you a
friend and we all need

87
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,541
a helping hand sometimes.

88
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,375
I'll do everything I can to
make things easier for you.

89
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,041
Between the two of us,
I'm sure we can handle

90
00:04:58,125 --> 00:04:59,250
whatever needs doing!

91
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,833
Just leave it to us!

92
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,875
Oh, come on, you have to have
more faith in me than that!

93
00:05:04,958 --> 00:05:07,583
Today, we'll be
serving you. Rest well.

94
00:05:09,625 --> 00:05:10,708
[MADOKA]
All right, Miyako.

95
00:05:10,791 --> 00:05:12,333
Just let me know what
you need me to do!

96
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:15,375
[MIYAKO] You got it, Madoka!
Sounds like a plan!

97
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,875
[gasps] Wait a minute!
The kitchen hasn't been--

98
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:20,875
[MIYAKO screams]
Someone call the police!

99
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:23,083
The kitchen's been
ransacked by robbers!

100
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:25,083
[MADOKA] Oh, I was just
doing a little baking!

101
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:27,041
I gotta get better soon.

102
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:50,500
[CHIHIRO]
They're cleaning the kitchen?

103
00:05:50,583 --> 00:05:53,458
[MIYAKO] Oh! Hi there!
We're just finishing up.

104
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,833
Would you like a
drink or something?

105
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,333
We have snacks, too.

106
00:05:57,416 --> 00:05:58,791
No, I don't need anything.

107
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,791
[MIYAKO] We'll start making
lunch soon, all right?

108
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,541
Okay.

109
00:06:02,625 --> 00:06:03,916
[laughs]

110
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,916
[CHIHIRO]
They're fine.

111
00:06:10,791 --> 00:06:13,833
[MADOKA] Miyako's gotten a lot
better at this, hasn't she?

112
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,208
It's good!

113
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,791
Thanks! Give yourself
a pat on the back

114
00:06:20,875 --> 00:06:22,458
because I learned
it all from you!

115
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:23,958
Delicious!

116
00:06:25,875 --> 00:06:26,958
[MIYAKO]
Chihiro?

117
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:28,500
Huh?

118
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:30,208
[MIYAKO] Do you have any idea
what you'd like for dinner?

119
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,375
Huh? I dunno.
Whatever you think.

120
00:06:33,458 --> 00:06:36,333
[MIYAKO laughs] You and Madoka
have a lot in common!

121
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,208
[yelps]

122
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:38,375
[MIYAKO giggles]

123
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:41,208
Japanese food is one
the house favorites.

124
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:45,416
Yeah. Sounds good.
Japanese food.

125
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:47,041
Thank you so much for cooking.

126
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:49,208
Honestly, it's my pleasure.

127
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:50,708
[CHIHIRO]
Hey.

128
00:06:50,791 --> 00:06:52,750
Are you completely sure you
won't need any help tonight?

129
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:54,208
I am!

130
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:57,000
I want to do this, so relax
and enjoy being waited on!

131
00:06:59,750 --> 00:07:00,708
I'm really glad.

132
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,625
I'll keep being
your right hand man!

133
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,208
If I had my way,
you wouldn't be allowed

134
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:05,666
to step foot in
that kitchen at all.

135
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,750
[yelps] I'm trying my best!

136
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:20,958
This is so boring. Man.

137
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:27,750
[CHIHIRO]
I've read all the magazines

138
00:07:27,833 --> 00:07:29,750
and homework was a cinch.

139
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,250
I would polish the kitchen sink

140
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,333
but those two
already beat me to it!

141
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,625
They've really taken
care of everything.

142
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,958
I guess they don't
need my help.

143
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,750
I feel like I'm taking
advantage of them,

144
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,583
but they're insisting
that I stay away.

145
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:47,250
It's not like Madoka
cares if things are messy.

146
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,791
He's probably just
helping out to shut me up.

147
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:54,666
They're being nice, but I
feel so useless right now.

148
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:59,125
I dunno. It's lonely,
not being needed.

149
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:03,333
[sniffs]

150
00:08:03,416 --> 00:08:06,041
[CHIHIRO]
Huh?! A fire?

151
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:07,625
Are you okay in here?

152
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:12,458
[BOTH] How long are you
supposed to cook fish?

153
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,125
I got so excited about
making Japanese food

154
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,958
for you tonight. I realized
halfway through the process,

155
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,541
my repertoire only
consists of Western dishes.

156
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:25,375
[MADOKA] I thought frying
fish would be simple,

157
00:08:25,458 --> 00:08:27,458
but it was a
horrible experience!

158
