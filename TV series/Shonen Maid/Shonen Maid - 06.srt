1
00:00:13,291 --> 00:00:14,500
[MADOKA]
Hm.

2
00:00:16,791 --> 00:00:19,583
Plain bun. Plum?

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:22,708
Plain Bun without plum--
Bun, bun, bun plum?

4
00:00:22,791 --> 00:00:24,583
But I didn't make any buns.

5
00:00:24,666 --> 00:00:26,166
[HINO]
Is that like a tongue twister?

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,333
[CHIHIRO]
I guess.

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,000
He always acts strange
around deadlines.

8
00:00:29,083 --> 00:00:31,375
[HINO] Oh, okay. So who's
the client this time?

9
00:00:31,458 --> 00:00:33,250
Dunno, but I think
it must be for a guy

10
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:36,208
or something, 'cause there are
a lot fewer frills than usual.

11
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:38,083
He sure likes frills.

12
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,250
[BOTH]
Huh?

13
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:46,041
[HINO, CHIHIRO]
Whoa, stranger danger!

14
00:00:49,916 --> 00:00:52,250
[RYUJI] Hey, kids, come on!
Help a guy out!

15
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,666
Ow! Stop that!
Look, I'm desperate!

16
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:56,000
I lost my wallet and my phone,

17
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,375
and I'm on the
brink of starvation!

18
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:58,708
I just need directions!

19
00:00:58,791 --> 00:00:59,958
Directions?

20
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,625
Yeah, I'm looking for
a man named Takatori.

21
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:04,583
What? Hold on.

22
00:01:04,666 --> 00:01:06,375
Do you mean Madoka Takatori?

23
00:01:06,458 --> 00:01:07,416
Huh?

24
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,083
I actually kinda live with him.

25
00:01:09,166 --> 00:01:09,875
[yells]

26
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:12,291
No way! What luck?

27
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:15,375
You're my hero!
Thank you so much!

28
00:01:15,458 --> 00:01:16,750
Can you please put me down?

29
00:01:16,833 --> 00:01:17,958
Who the heck are you?

30
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:19,583
[RYUJI]
Oh, sorry about that!

31
00:01:19,666 --> 00:01:22,458
You're Ryuji from the
Uchoten Boys, am I right?

32
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,333
What? Is it really that obvious?

33
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:25,958
I thought my
disguise was perfect.

34
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:27,291
You're who?

35
00:01:30,125 --> 00:01:32,916
See? And they're constantly
on TV and stuff, too.

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,083
Oh, I don't really
watch much television.

37
00:01:35,166 --> 00:01:39,000
[HINO] Hayato is the lead
singer, and then there's Ibuki.

38
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,625
And he's...

39
00:01:40,708 --> 00:01:42,500
Ryuji.

40
00:01:42,583 --> 00:01:44,041
That's me!

41
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:22,750
[RYUJI]
Cool! I have this game, too!

42
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,666
I just beat the boss
on the third level!

43
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,208
[HINO]
Yeah? Was it hard?

44
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:27,708
[KEIICHIRO]
I'm confused, I knew

45
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:29,291
that Master Madoka
was designing the band's

46
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,500
new stage costumes,
but why would Ryuji

47
00:03:31,583 --> 00:03:32,583
need to come here?

48
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,166
[MADOKA]
Yeah, it's unusual for a client

49
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:35,750
to just show up at my house.

50
00:03:35,833 --> 00:03:37,583
[CHIHIRO] I thought you knew
him personally or something!

51
00:03:37,666 --> 00:03:40,583
[MADOKA]
I only know him through work.

52
00:03:40,666 --> 00:03:41,916
Go see what he wants, Chi.

53
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,958
What, why me?

54
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,958
I don't like
talking to strangers.

55
00:03:45,041 --> 00:03:46,416
[CHIHIRO]
Huh.

56
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,166
Whoa! That looks amazing!

57
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,458
It's for me?

58
00:03:49,541 --> 00:03:50,875
Yeah. Didn't you say
you were starvin--

59
00:03:50,958 --> 00:03:52,333
[RYUJI]
Thank you!

60
00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:55,458
You're a saint, a life saver,
and my new best friend!

61
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,125
Ah!

62
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,958
But I'm his best friend.

63
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,458
So, what's up with that outfit?

64
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:04,166
Are you like a cosplayer?

65
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,416
No, I am not!

66
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,666
[RYUJI]
Are you sure?

67
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,958
Yes. Look, this happens
to be my work uniform.

68
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,500
Madoka is the one who made it.

69
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:13,416
Oh! No kidding,
he really made that?

70
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,708
How cool!

71
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,625
Madoka's one of the
most popular designers

72
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,250
in the country,
y'know, but he's famous

73
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,708
for not taking on a lot
of jobs. It's rare.

74
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,666
Honestly though.

75
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:27,958
I totally thought he'd
be some stuffy old guy.

76
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:30,250
I wasn't thrilled about
meeting him. Until...

77
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:33,083
[gasps] He turned out
to be so awesome!

78
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,666
He's all sophisticated
and stuff!

79
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:37,708
He's, like, the
coolest adult ever!

80
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:41,625
Uh, Madoka? An adult?

81
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:45,208
Wait, that reminds me!
I didn't come here for food!

82
00:04:45,291 --> 00:04:46,375
Delicious!

83
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:49,083
Listen. I really gotta
speak to Madoka!

84
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,625
Yeah, about what?

85
00:04:50,708 --> 00:04:54,833
[RYUJI] Well, I need to tell
him that I hate... my shorts.

86
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:55,750
[CHIHIRO]
Uh...

87
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:57,208
That's right!

88
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,291
All the costumes we wear
during our performances

89
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,875
make me look like a little kid!

90
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:02,583
I came to ask him to
change things up a bit!

91
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:03,833
No more shorts!

92
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:05,458
I'm going on a bare leg strike!

93
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,333
You don't understand my pain!

94
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,291
Even when I land a great pose,
the girls squeal "so cute!"

95
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:12,916
I just wanna be cool
like the other guys!

96
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,500
You're right. I don't
understand your pain.

97
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,958
[MADOKA]
I can't. Sorry.

98
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,208
[gasps] No way.

99
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,875
Why can't you change it?

100
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,208
[MADOKA] Because they already
approved the design.

101
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:28,000
The most I can do is play around
with the smaller details,

102
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,333
but I can't make
any major changes.

103
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:32,041
That's the way it is.

104
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:35,958
I won't go home
until you fix it!

105
00:05:36,041 --> 00:05:37,750
I'm afraid there's
nothing I can do.

106
00:05:37,833 --> 00:05:38,916
Look, I don't care!

107
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,375
I refuse to wear
any more stupid shorts!

108
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,750
I'll never perform in that!

109
00:05:42,833 --> 00:05:45,500
--[RYUJI yelping]
--[crashing]

110
00:05:45,583 --> 00:05:47,333
He hasn't even tried it on yet.

111
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,541
[gasps]

112
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:53,083
[RYUJI whimpers]
I thought he was the kind of guy

113
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,041
who would listen to me.

114
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:58,041
Why on earth would you
think something like that?

115
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,500
I'm short, and just
because of that,

116
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,583
people always treat me
like a little boy.

117
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:05,458
Whenever I meet someone new,
they pat me on the head!

118
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,708
How insulting is that? I'm 16.

119
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:09,208
I'm practically a man already!

120
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:11,083
[CHIHIRO]
Throwing a tantrum probably

121
00:06:11,166 --> 00:06:12,458
doesn't help your image.

122
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,041
[RYUJI] But not Madoka--
he treated me like an adult.

123
00:06:15,125 --> 00:06:17,916
He's different, and maybe that's
why I thought he could help.

124
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,333
He gets me.

125
00:06:19,416 --> 00:06:21,416
[HINO] Yeah, I hate to
interrupt this daydream, but...

126
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,250
I think the only thing Madoka
gets is a love for frills.

127
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,416
Exhibit A.

128
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:31,833
[yelps] He tricked me!

129
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791
Oh, yeah, and how
exactly did he trick you?

130
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,666
You're the one jumping
to conclusions here!

131
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,000
A boy in a maid outfit
wouldn't understand!

132
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,875
Why do you actually wear
those stupid clothes anyway?

133
00:06:40,958 --> 00:06:41,958
You look like a girl!

134
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,166
How dare you!

135
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,583
These clothes happen
to be very practical!

136
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,875
Not only are they
easy to work in,

137
00:06:45,958 --> 00:06:47,458
they're also machine washable!

138
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:48,541
Whatever!

139
00:06:48,625 --> 00:06:49,750
There's no way
you're not embarrassed

140
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,250
by that ridiculous outfit!

141
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:52,833
Bet you wouldn't
even wear it outside!

142
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,041
I'm not embarrassed!

143
00:06:54,125 --> 00:06:55,916
Just watch!

144
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,125
I'm going to the store!

145
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,958
You know, for a guy
claiming to be an adult,

146
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,291
you act super childish.

147
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:05,583
You don't like
being made fun of,

148
00:07:05,666 --> 00:07:07,125
but that's exactly
what you just did.

149
00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:08,750
He was really embarrassed
the first time

150
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,458
we saw him in those clothes.

151
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:17,333
[HINO]
Well, I'm outta here.

152
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,208
[door clicks]

153
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:23,583
[RYUJI] A boy in a maid
outfit wouldn't understand!

154
00:07:23,666 --> 00:07:26,375
You look like a girl!

155
00:07:26,458 --> 00:07:28,000
He's right.

156
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:31,416
I can't believe I really said
the things I would hate to hear.

157
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,458
[RYUJI]
I need to apologize to him.

158
00:07:37,583 --> 00:07:39,083
[CHIHIRO]
Hey, I'm back!

159
00:07:39,166 --> 00:07:41,833
Um, I'm sorry for what I said!

160
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,333

[MIYAKO] The main building
has a much larger kitchen,

319
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,666
but this is my personal one
to use whenever I like.

320
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,208
Father had it built for me as
a birthday present last year!

321

It's nice.

322

[CHIHIRO] Wow, he gave
her an entire house?

323
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,875
Anyway, let's go
ahead and get started.

324
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,208
[CHIHIRO]
Um, yeah!

325

[ANTARO panting]

326

[CHIHIRO]
Hm. I think this will be enough.

327
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,750
And we could make
chirashi sushi.

328
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:41,750
[MIYAKO]
Oh, look!

329
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,458
Here's a recipe
for roast chicken!

330
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:46,041
But it might be
difficult to make it.

331
00:14:46,125 --> 00:14:47,250
Our house has a huge oven.

332
00:14:47,333 --> 00:14:48,916
If we work together,
I think we could do it!

333
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,208
Yay!

334
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:52,791
[CHIHIRO]
Hm?

335
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:55,666
[MIYAKO] I'm so glad you're
here to help, Chihiro.

336
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,125
Because there's no way
I could have made

337
00:14:57,208 --> 00:14:58,708
this much food all on my own.

338
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:01,666
With you here, we can actually
have a proper party this year!

339
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,166
[CHIHIRO]
What do you mean?

340
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,958
[MIYAKO] Madoka has always
accepted the gifts I gave him.

341
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:08,750
But not once have we ever
thrown him a party.

342
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:09,500
Actually...

343
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:10,875
What's up?

344
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,041
So, uh, what kind of present
do you usually give him?

345
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:16,916
Every year, I always bake him
a homemade cake from scratch!

346
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,750
When I was little,
Madoka taught me

347
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,083
how to bake one.

348
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:22,125
So it became our tradition
for me to make him one

349
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:23,583
for his birthday every year.

350
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,791
[CHIHIRO]
That's sweet.

351
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:26,000
[MIYAKO] This year,
I'm going to try my hand

352
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:28,916
at baking one of those
multi-tiered cakes!

353
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:29,791
[MIYAKO]
What about you?

354
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,125
Have you decided on a gift yet?

355
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,583
[CHIHIRO]
Not exactly.

356
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,958
To be honest, I don't really
know what to get him.

357
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:37,458
[MIYAKO]
He's a simple man.

358
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:38,750
I think he would
probably be happy

359
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,708
to get any gift from you at all.

360
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:43,208
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah, Keiichiro said that, too.

361
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:46,416
Still, he's given me so much.

362
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:49,416
A place to live and my own room.

363
00:15:51,750 --> 00:15:54,375
I just really wanna
return the favor.

364
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,500
Then maybe you
could just tell him

365
00:15:57,583 --> 00:15:58,750
how you're feeling.

366
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:00,750
I think that would be
the best present of all.

367
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:01,958
Really?

368
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:04,250
[barks]

369

Looks like Antaro wants
us to take a break.

370
00:16:08,208 --> 00:16:09,791
[MIYAKO]
I'll make us some tea.

371
00:16:09,875 --> 00:16:11,750
in the meantime, do you
think could play outside

372
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:13,583
with Antaro for a little bit?

373
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,916
There's a gazebo in the back
garden. You can go there.

374
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,708
[CHIHIRO]
Okay then!

Hey, Chihiro?

I'm sure whatever
present you end up

377
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:25,166
getting him will be
amazing. You'll be fine.

I wanted to get a few roses,

but Kayako went back in

to get some scissors
and hasn't returned yet.

Ah, Kayako is actually
the lady of this house.

aren't roses, are they?

They're not.
They're <i>awayuki</i> flowers.

Well then, here's my advice.

424
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,666
Does the present necessarily
have to be a physical object?

425

[CHIHIRO]
Huh?

[CHIHIRO]
Um, yeah, I guess that's true.

If you're this worried about it,

430

you must truly care
for him a lot.

what he likes,

things make him happy.

[MADOKA]
Aw!

482
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,041
Isn't it lovely?

483
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,250
I made a really
big one this year!

It's purr-fect!

[sighs] I never knew
birthday parties

492
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,166
were so a-meow-zing!

493
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:39,166
Maybe I'll start celebrating
my birthday on a daily basis!

[KEIICHIRO] Then you'd grow

Talk about worth it!

And look! Chi doesn't get mad
at me either, I'm so happy!

Don't get angry.

Just keep it together
a little longer.

00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,083
Only three more hours.

500

Aw! Wait!

501
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,250
Are you saving it
all up for tomorrow?

502
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,541
Does that mean you're like
a time bomb of meanness?

503
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:59,708
Aw! I knew all this
was too good to be true!

[CHIHIRO] Oh, well.
I'm glad he had fun today.

505
00:22:04,333 --> 00:22:06,125
And it was all thanks to her.

506
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:12,041
[CHIHIRO]
But who was she, anyway?

[RYUJI] What's up? I'm Ryuji
from the Uchoten Boys!

What did you think of our music?

511
00:23:57,375 --> 00:23:58,708
Pretty awesome stuff, huh?

512

Thank you, thank you,

What's that?

00:24:02,375 --> 00:24:04,333
You think Ryuji has cute legs?
Hey, they like your legs!

515
00:24:04,416 --> 00:24:05,541
[RYUJI]
Thanks I guess?

516
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,750
[IBUKI] Well, we had
to give you something.

Every dog has his
day, am I right?

518
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:09,791
[RYUJI]
Absolutely--

519
00:24:09,875 --> 00:24:11,708
W-Wait a second,
what does that mean?

520
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,125
[HAYATO]
Never mind that.

Not Happen in a Day."

523
00:24:17,208 --> 00:24:18,833
to see you all again next week!

We're counting on you!
