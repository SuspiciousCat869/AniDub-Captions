00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:12,541
[CHIHIRO]
Hello! I'm Chihiro Komiya.

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:14,250
I'm just your
normal fifth grader.

3
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:16,375
Not long after my mom
passed away, I moved in

4
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,500
with my uncle, Madoka Takatori.

5
00:00:18,583 --> 00:00:20,541
He's nice enough,
but it's not in my nature

6
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:21,958
to accept handouts.

7
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:23,458
So, in exchange
for room and board,

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,708
I handle all the cooking
and cleaning around here.

9
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:27,250
It's like my mom always said,

10
00:00:27,333 --> 00:00:29,875
"Those who do not work
shall not eat."

11
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,208
Lookin' good!

12
00:02:21,041 --> 00:02:22,083
[CHIHIRO]
What would be a good choice

13
00:02:22,166 --> 00:02:23,666
for breakfast this morning?

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,833
We just ate French
toast yesterday,

15
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,083
so how 'bout something
with a little less sugar.

16
00:02:28,166 --> 00:02:29,833
Like some salmon, maybe?

17
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:34,833
[CHIHIRO] I swear...
He never closes the door.

18
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,000
[scuttling]

19
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,083
[CHIHIRO gasping]

20
00:02:42,166 --> 00:02:45,083
[CHIHIRO screams]

21
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,291
Good morning, everyone--

22
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,416
[CHIHIRO]
Enough is enough!

23
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,750
You've left me no choice!

24
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,333
Like it or not, I'm doing this.

25
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,541
[MADOKA]
That's not fair!

26
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:06,958
We had a deal, no take backsies!

27
00:03:08,083 --> 00:03:10,250
Um, what's all the commotion?

28
00:03:10,333 --> 00:03:12,166
Keiichiro, please help me!

29
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,000
Chihiro has declared war
on my personal space!

30
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:16,625
What? Declared war?

31
00:03:16,708 --> 00:03:18,750
Stop being so overdramatic!

32
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:22,166
Give up already.
This is your own fault!

33
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:24,041
We could have
avoided this, but no!

34
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,583
You refused to
take responsibility,

35
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,500
and now it's up to me to
clean up your stupid room!

36
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:30,416
[KEIICHIRO] Oh, we're just
talking about his room.

37
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,791
Yes, it was horrible!

38
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,166
When I looked, he was
in there! The Bearded Baron!

39
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:38,875
[KEIICHIRO]
There's a man in his room?

40
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:41,791
[BEARDED BARON laughs]

41
00:03:41,875 --> 00:03:44,625
[BEARDED BARON]
Good day! How do you do?

42
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,291
[NARRATOR]
Behold the Bearded Baron:

43
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:48,041
Dark, fast and resilient.

44
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:51,750
He is the "King of Pests,"
according to the Komiyas.

45
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:54,125
[CHIHIRO] To think that
he lives in this house.

46
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,791
A house that I clean?

47
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,916
No way. He's going down!

48
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,625
I'll scrub every crevice!
He'll have nowhere

49
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,291
--left to hide!
--[MADOKA] No! You can't!

50
00:04:04,375 --> 00:04:06,000
[CHIHIRO]
I can and I will!

51
00:04:06,083 --> 00:04:07,583
[MADOKA]
You're such a meanie-face!

52
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,000
[CHIHIRO]
Is that all you've got?

53
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,208
[KEIICHIRO] Maybe this really
is a declaration of war.

54
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,708
Perhaps I should
set up some roach--

55
00:04:12,791 --> 00:04:15,791
or Bearded Baron-traps
in Madoka's room.

56
00:04:16,958 --> 00:04:19,333
[CHIHIRO sighs]
Finally.

57
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,041
There's nothing stopping me from

58
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:25,333
taming this chaotic
land once and for all!

59
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,833
Do you need help with anything?

60
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:30,083
[CHIHIRO] I can handle it.
It's only one room.

61
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:31,541
Could you find a way
to keep Madoka

62
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,500
outta my hair, though?

63
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:33,666
I've got you covered.

64
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,000
[barking]

65
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:38,166
[whines] Just 'cause it's
a toy doesn't make it

66
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:41,708
any less terrifying!
You guys are the worst!

67
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,208
[barking]

68
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:46,041
Keiichiro, let's go!

69
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,583
[CHIHIRO laughing]

70
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:50,250
[KEIICHIRO]
Make way for the clean machine.

71
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,000
It's getting there.

72
00:04:58,083 --> 00:05:00,583
Still, I can't believe
he sleeps in this pig sty.

73
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:01,958
It's gross.

74
00:05:04,750 --> 00:05:05,958
[CHIHIRO]
What's this thing?

75
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,333
[CHIHIRO]
Looks like a present.

76
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:12,125
What the heck?
It's literally just paper.

77
00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:15,583
[CHIHIRO]
Why does he save trash?

78
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:19,125
[CHIHIRO]
There's a ton of them.

79
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:20,958
They can't all be fake, right?

80
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,833
[CHIHIRO] What the heck
is wrong with this guy?

81
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:31,750
[KEIICHIRO]
All right, see you tomorrow.

82
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:38,791
[CHIHIRO] Ta-dah! Pretty
amazing, dontcha think?

83
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:41,625
[MADOKA whimpers]

84
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,083
[MADOKA] This doesn't even
look like my room anymore.

85
00:05:44,166 --> 00:05:47,958
[CHIHIRO] No, it looks like
a place a human could sleep.

86
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,791
Where are the things
that were here?

87
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:51,416
I put away the books,

88
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,958
your stationery
is in the drawer,

89
00:05:53,041 --> 00:05:54,791
I washed the dirty laundry,

90
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,416
and I threw away all the trash.

91
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,875
The trash?

92
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,958
Yes, so do me a favor and
stop leaving it everywhere.

93
00:06:02,041 --> 00:06:05,958
Also, start putting your dirty
laundry out so I can wash it.

94
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,083
[MADOKA]
Fine.

95
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,500
Huh?

96
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:13,666
[MADOKA]
I'm finished.

97
00:06:13,750 --> 00:06:16,458
Huh? What? Already?

98
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:17,916
Do you feel okay?

99
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,625
[MADOKA]
Mm.

100
00:06:19,708 --> 00:06:22,208
Then what's wrong?
Is it my cooking?

101
00:06:24,791 --> 00:06:27,041
I don't get it.
Tastes good to me.

102
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,750
[MADOKA]
I think I'll call it a night.

103
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:30,583
[CHIHIRO]
Uh, h-hey, wait!

104
00:06:32,208 --> 00:06:33,958
[CHIHIRO] You have so
many clean clothes now,

105
00:06:34,041 --> 00:06:36,250
I don't think they'll
all fit in your closet.

106
00:06:36,333 --> 00:06:37,875
What do you want me
to do with the extras?

107
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,208
Oh. Just throw them out.

108
00:06:40,291 --> 00:06:42,458
[CHIHIRO] Okay, well pick which
ones you don't want then.

109
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:45,083
I honestly don't care.
I'll leave it up to you.

110
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,291
Hey, come on!

111
00:06:46,375 --> 00:06:48,166
They're your clothes,
you should choose!

112
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,000
[CHIHIRO]
What's his problem?

113
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:57,708
A second hand clothes shop?

114
00:06:57,791 --> 00:06:59,250
Yeah.

115
00:06:59,333 --> 00:07:01,750
Madoka told me I could throw out
the clothes he doesn't wear,

116
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,750
but it seems like such a waste.

117
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:04,750
Indeed it does.

118
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:06,125
I'll drive you to one nearby.

119
00:07:06,208 --> 00:07:07,666
Yeah? Thanks!

120
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,875
You're quite welcome.
It's no problem at all.

121
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,458
I'm used to playing chauffeur.

122
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:13,041
I'll go get changed!

123
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:16,750
[KEIICHIRO]
Hm?

124
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:19,583
Hey, uh, about Madoka.

125
00:07:19,666 --> 00:07:22,750
He's been weird.
Is something wrong with him?

126
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:25,166
Not far as I know.
Why, weird how?

127
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:28,000
He just seems kinda
down in the dumps lately.

128
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,708
Ah.

129
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:33,208
He's probably pouting
because you lectured him.

130
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,500
Maybe I was a bit hard on him,
but he's seriously such a slob.

131
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,958
Honestly, I think you did
the right thing yesterday.

132
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,208
Really?

133
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:42,958
Madoka's a bit of a hoarder.

134
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:45,333
He can't stand
throwing things away.

135
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,750
Why is he like that?

136
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:48,833
[KEIICHIRO]
Well... He's very sentimental.

137
00:07:48,916 --> 00:07:52,333
Like, when he gets a gift, he
always saves the wrapping paper.

138
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,500
[MADOKA]
Keiichiro! Look at this!

139
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:56,625
Now there are two!

140
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,583
[KEIICHIRO] He could duplicate
the original packaging

141
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,083
down to the ribbon.

142
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,416
It's a unique,
albeit useless, skill.

143
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,916
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah...

144
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,166
[KEIICHIRO] I think the
reason he saves the paper

145
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:12,125
is because he actually
cherishes receiving a present

146
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,166
more than the present itself.

147
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,833
[CHIHIRO]
It just looks like trash to me.

148
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:28,583
[CHIHIRO]
But still...

149
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:29,666
[CHIHIRO]
Mom, come here!

150
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:31,500
[CHIYO]
Hm?

151
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,541
Hey, can I throw away
all these old papers

152
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,041
on the fridge?
Like this one here.

153
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,666
[CHIYO]
What? No way, buster!

154
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,333
This is special!
A precious memento!

155
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,166
[CHIHIRO]
It is?

156
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,833
Yes!

157
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:48,000
This is the list from your
first trip to the grocery store.

158
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,041
Silly me, I accidentally
wrote it in kanji.

159
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,666
You didn't know how
to read that yet,

160
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,666
so you almost broke down crying
right there on the sidewalk!

161
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:57,833
You were simply adorable!

162
00:08:57,916 --> 00:08:59,083
You were there?

163
00:08:59,166 --> 00:09:02,333
Everything on here is
special. You see this?

164
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:04,875
It's the first time
you wrote your name.

165
00:09:04,958 --> 00:09:07,208
That looks like a map!

166
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,666
[CHIYO] And this one
is the first picture

167
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,208
you ever drew of me!

168
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:11,541
Creepy!

169
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:14,041
Why do you keep these
dumb papers on the fridge?

170
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:17,375
Duh, so I can see
them, silly head!

171
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:19,750
[CHIHIRO] Yeah but it's all
cluttered and trashy looking.

172
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,750
Plus, there's not any room left
to put up the lunch schedule.

173
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:26,166
No worries, you can just
put the schedule on top!

174
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,708
Am I a genius or what?

175
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:29,333
[CHIHIRO]
Uh...

176
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:33,041
[CHIHIRO] Maybe hoarding
runs in the family.

177
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:38,333
[CHIHIRO] To me it's just
trash. But to them...

178
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,291
[CHIHIRO]
Okay.

179
00:09:50,708 --> 00:09:52,041
[CHIHIRO]
Keiichiro!

180
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:54,208
Looks like you could
use some help.

181
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:55,666
[CHIHIRO] Careful! You'll
get your suit dirty.

182
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,875
My clothes'll be fine.

183
00:09:57,958 --> 00:10:01,083
I say we work together.
It's faster that way.

184
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:06,000
[KEIICHIRO] Oof. Wow, all this
trash came from his room?

185
00:10:06,083 --> 00:10:07,041
[CHIHIRO]
Yep.

186
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:11,041
[MADOKA]
Uh...

187
00:10:11,125 --> 00:10:12,333
[CHIHIRO]
Um, here.

188
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,583
They got kinda
crumpled in the trash.

189
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,375
I ironed them out but,

190
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,250
I couldn't get them back
into the shapes they were in.

191
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,250
Sorry.

192
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,166
I think I remember how
they went, so it's okay.

193
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,750
They're nice and neat now.

194
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:34,083
Thanks a lot. I mean it.

195
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:43,041
[CHIHIRO]
For the record...

196
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:44,875
This is also kinda your fault

197
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:47,541
for mixing important things
in with the trash.

198
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,958
[MADOKA] Lecture mode?
But we just made up!

199
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,958
Put your important stuff
inside this box.

200
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,875
You got that? Otherwise,
I'm gonna toss it.

201
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,333
[MADOKA]
Just like a mother.

202
00:10:59,416 --> 00:11:00,708
There's no way I
could fit everything

203
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,083
into such a small box!

204
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,208
Well I suggest you make it fit!

205
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,875
By the way, anything sticking
out gets tossed, too.

206
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,375
[MADOKA]
That's not fair!

207
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:09,666
Life's not fair.

208
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,875
[MADOKA]
You're not fair.

209
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,083
[CHIHIRO]
Don't sass me!

210
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:12,833
[MADOKA]
I wasn't!

211
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:13,500
[CHIHIRO]
Were, too!

212
00:11:13,583 --> 00:11:14,291
[MADOKA]
Was not!

213
00:11:14,375 --> 00:11:15,791
[CHIHIRO]
I heard you!

214
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,375
[CHIHIRO] Okay, next it says
to combine the eggs,

215
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:27,500
sugar, and milk, and then,
stir in the vanilla.

216
00:11:27,583 --> 00:11:30,250
And then we mix it
all together, right?

217
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:31,750
Good job!

218
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:33,208
After you're finished with
the mixing, use the strainer.

219
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,458
Aye-aye, Captain!

220
00:11:38,166 --> 00:11:40,125
According to the recipe,
straining the mixture

221
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:41,916
twice will make
it much smoother.

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,166
Okay!

223
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:52,875
Does the book mention

224
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:55,208
when we're supposed to
add in the caramel sauce?

225
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:56,541
Let's see...

226
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:58,791
Oops, looks like we should
have done that first.

227
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,083
Oh wait, let's try this out.

228
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,791
[MIYAKO]
Oh, look! It's working.

229
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:09,125
Even though we added it last,

230
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:12,000
its density makes the sauce
sink to the bottom!

231
00:12:12,083 --> 00:12:13,291
I haven't made pudding before,

232
00:12:13,375 --> 00:12:15,625
so I never knew about
that little fact.

233
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,083
[CHIHIRO]
Let it bake for 30 minutes.

234
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:20,708
[ding]

235
00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:24,916
Once they're cool to the touch,

236
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,458
wrap them in plastic
and let them chill

237
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,291
in the fridge for a while.

238
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:33,000
[cuckoo clock ringing]

239
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:38,833
Look!

240
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,208
The caramel sauce didn't mix

241
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:42,375
with the pudding
at all--how amazing!

242
00:12:42,458 --> 00:12:44,833
Yeah! They look perfect!

243
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:46,375
Yay!

244
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:47,541
Except...

245
00:12:47,625 --> 00:12:49,208
Except what?

246
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,791
They have some pores.

247
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:52,083
Pores?

248
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,333
Yeah, see these little
spots here on the surface?

249
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,791
Oh!

250
00:12:57,875 --> 00:13:00,416
I've seen this before
with savory custard.

251
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,083
And sometimes it can
actually end up

252
00:13:02,166 --> 00:13:04,041
affecting the dessert's flavor.

253
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,958
Isn't there anything we can do
to prevent it from happening?

254
00:13:07,041 --> 00:13:08,583
It's an easy fix:
adjust the heat

255
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:12,375
when it's steaming, and keep
a close eye on 'em, too.

256
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,750
Funny, you'd think pudding

257
00:13:13,833 --> 00:13:15,958
would be easier to make,
but the process is actually

258
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,916
a lot more complicated
than I ever imagined.

259
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:27,000
Porous texture aside,
it's extremely tasty!

260
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:27,833
Not bad at all!

261
00:13:27,916 --> 00:13:29,833
Thank you so much, Madoka!

262
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:32,250
[MADOKA] Keep up the great
work, for Keiichiro's sake!

263
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:34,500
He simply adores pudding!

264
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:35,666
Okay!

265
00:13:35,750 --> 00:13:37,333
Poor guy looks like
he's really stressed

266
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,750
from work lately.
But I wonder why?

267
00:13:39,833 --> 00:13:40,625
You're his boss.

268
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,916
Isn't that reason enough?

269
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,916
I won't give up
until it's perfect.

270
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,041
I'll make so happy, all his
stress will melt away!

271
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,416
Get it, girl!

272
00:13:52,541 --> 00:13:55,125
Miss Miyako invited us
all to a tea party?

273
00:13:55,208 --> 00:13:57,916
Yes. Next Sunday, I believe.

274
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
Well, I think I'm available.

275
00:14:00,083 --> 00:14:01,583
Miyako has been
working really hard

276
00:14:01,666 --> 00:14:03,750
to improve her
cooking and baking.

277
00:14:03,833 --> 00:14:06,833
It's getting to where she barely
even needs my help anymore.

278
00:14:06,916 --> 00:14:10,625
Is that a fact?
I'm happy to hear it.

279
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:12,041
I wonder though.

280
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:15,291
Miss Miyako seems awfully
focused on cooking lately.

281
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,291
Does she want to become
a chef or something?

282
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:19,083
[CHIHIRO]
Seriously?

283
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:22,750
Well... I suspect she
dreams of getting married.

284
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,458
To someone special.

285
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,208
Ah, she's playing house, then?

286
00:14:28,291 --> 00:14:29,583
[MADOKA]
Ah...

287
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,833
[CHIHIRO]
Come on, it's so obvious!

288
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,666
[MIYAKO]
My dear Keiichiro!

289
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,125
[CHIHIRO] It's not like she
hides her feelings well.

290
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,291
Maybe he knows and is
pretending that he doesn't?

291
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:50,833
[CHIHIRO]
Huh?

292
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,583
Isn't this Keiichiro's planner?

293
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,833
It's not like him to
leave his stuff around.

294
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,041
Ah!

295
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,625
[CHIHIRO gasps]

296
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,500
Ah!

297
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:20,208
[door creaks]

298
00:15:20,291 --> 00:15:22,583
[HINO] There was a picture
of a girl in his planner?

299
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,291
Well, maybe he has a girlfriend.

300
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,500
Or he's, like, crushing on her?

301
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:27,750
I have no idea!

302
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:29,541
The picture looks like
it could be kinda old.

303
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:30,791
And the girl seems really young,

304
00:15:30,875 --> 00:15:32,458
like maybe she's
still in junior high?

305
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:33,750
[HINO]
Uh, doesn't that just mean

306
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:34,958
they go way back or whatever?

307
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:35,916
[gasps]

308
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,750
[giggling]

309
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:40,958
[CHIHIRO]
What should I do?

310
00:15:41,041 --> 00:15:42,958
This could ruin everything!

311
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:47,708
[MADOKA gasps]
It looks amazing!

312
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:48,958
Thank you!

313
00:15:49,041 --> 00:15:51,375
I've tried really hard
to perfect the recipe!

314
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:55,125
It took a few attempts,
but I finally got it!

315
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:58,125
[CHIHIRO] Should I tell Miyako
about the picture I found?

316
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,958
[CHIHIRO] But then again,
it's not like Keiichiro

317
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,250
has ever mentioned it, right?

318
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:04,666
So I should probably
mind my own business!

319
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:06,916
And it really isn't my
business, it's his business.

320
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,666
Except, Miyako's been working
hard so maybe it's her business!

321
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:12,458
This is way too business-y,
I don't know what to do!

322
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:14,375
Want some?

323
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:15,708
[yelps] What's up?

324
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,208
Did you wanna try any of it?

325
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:21,208
Oh, yes, of course I do!

326
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:24,375
Wow, the texture is
perfect. Great job!

327
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,083
[MIYAKO]
Yay, I'm so happy you think so!

328
00:16:29,416 --> 00:16:31,750
All right then, I'm
leaving! See you later!

329
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:33,375
Yep! Have a good night!

330
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,000
Get home safe!

331
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:40,458
[MADOKA]
Hm?

332
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,333
You okay?

333
00:16:41,416 --> 00:16:42,458
[gasps]

334
00:16:42,541 --> 00:16:44,750
You seem kind of preoccupied.

335
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,541
You don't have to share.

336
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,625
Uh--

337
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:59,041
Well, it's kind of
like a secret, okay?

338
00:16:59,125 --> 00:17:00,833
[MADOKA]
Hm.

339
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:02,250
The thing is...

340
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,541
Keiichiro, do you
have a girlfriend?

341
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,208
--What?
--[clatter]

342
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,166
[gasping]

343
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,666
Oh, Chihiro? Everything okay?

344
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,625
Yes! Just peachy!

345
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:14,458
[MADOKA laughing]

346
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,666
[CHIHIRO]
What an idiot!

347
00:17:15,750 --> 00:17:17,083
How does "probe discreetly"
translate into

348
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,541
whatever the heck this is?

349
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,041
I should have
used smaller words!

350
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:22,000
Well?

351
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:23,875
Why are you suddenly interested?

352
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,333
Come on, please? I'm curious!

353
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,000
What's the love scoop?

354
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:31,250
[KEIICHIRO sighs]
Sorry, no girlfriend.

355
00:17:31,333 --> 00:17:33,166
[MADOKA]
Hm...

356
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:35,500
Well, who's the cutie
in the picture, then?

357
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,375
Way to go, Captain Obvious!

358
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:38,541
Picture?

359
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,750
[MADOKA]
Yes!

360
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:42,333
I get it now.

361
00:17:42,416 --> 00:17:43,916
You mean the photo
in my planner.

362
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,000
[CHIHIRO]
He knows!

363
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:50,083
Chihiro, if you want to hear,
you could just come inside.

364
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,500
Okay.

365
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:55,208
Sorry I looked at your
stuff without permission.

366
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,625
But I wasn't being nosy!

367
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:58,541
It just kinda fell out
when I picked it up!

368
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:00,500
Really, it's quite all right.

369
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:05,166
If anything, it's just as much
my fault for leaving it out.

370
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,750
So, which picture did you mean?

371
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,625
What? How many do you have?

372
00:18:11,708 --> 00:18:15,083
Hey. The other girl
in this photo...

373
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:18,166
[KEIICHIRO] Ah. You mean
the one with Miss Chiyo?

374
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,708
My mom?

375
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:21,083
[KEIICHIRO]
Yes.

376
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:24,666
As I'm sure you've been
told, you look like her.

377
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:26,458
[CHIHIRO]
But what about this girl?

378
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,333
The one next to her--who is she?

379
00:18:28,416 --> 00:18:30,541
Were they friends or something?

380
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:31,875
I wanna see!

381
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:34,916
It is a picture of Chiyo,
right? Gimme, gimme!

382
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,083
Ah--

383
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:39,708
Why? How could you, Keiichiro?

384
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:40,708
Huh?

385
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,916
[KEIICHIRO]
That's not a girl.

386
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:44,750
That's Master Madoka.
Isn't he beautiful?

387
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,041
[CHIHIRO]
What?!

388
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,916
[KEIICHIRO]
Well, you see, back when we were

389
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:53,666
all much younger, Miss Chiyo
managed to convince

390
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,041
Master Madoka to play dress up
with her one afternoon.

391
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,916
--[MADOKA growls]
--The only problem was,

392
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,041
he made a pretty
convincing girl,

393
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,041
and since he didn't
put up much of a fight,

394
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:05,250
your mother got a
little carried away.

395
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:08,500
[CHIHIRO] He didn't even
draw the line at a wig?

396
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:11,083
Why on earth are you
carrying these around?

397
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,375
Let's just say that
sometimes a little blackmail

398
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,291
can be the perfect motivator.

399
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,208
I loathe you right now!

400
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:18,875
[KEIICHIRO] But, since the
cat is out of the bag,

401
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,750
this trump card is useless now.

402
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,416
Oops. Sorry about that.

403
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:24,333
It's no problem.

404
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,208
I still have plenty
more trump cards!

405
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,875
You have more?

406
00:19:27,958 --> 00:19:30,875
When did you become
so evil, Keiichiro?

407
00:19:30,958 --> 00:19:32,416
[KEIICHIRO]
Such cruel words.

408
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:36,291
[gasps] Wait a second,
what's this one?

409
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,666
[KEIICHIRO]
Ah. That picture.

410
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:40,958
It's Master Madoka
and Miss Miyako.

411
00:19:41,041 --> 00:19:42,458
[CHIHIRO]
Aw...

412
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,125
[shutter clicks]

413
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,500
[KEIICHIRO] That day was the
first time I ever used a camera

414
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,916
on my own, and I took this
picture, so it's special.

415
00:19:57,625 --> 00:19:59,833
[CHIHIRO]
Now I get it!

416
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:01,333
All right!

417
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:06,375
[MIYAKO]
Aw! Wow! We were both so little.

418
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,541
I know. Do you remember it?

419
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:09,791
No.

420
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,208
[KEIICHIRO]
Well, you were just a baby.

421
00:20:11,291 --> 00:20:13,708
[gasps] I have a great idea!

422
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:16,333
Let's commemorate the
occasion with a new photo!

423
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:18,083
Would you do the honors?

424
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:20,208
Why do you want me to take it?

425
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:22,875
Because you're much better
at this than I am.

426
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:26,875
Can you please move in
a little closer?

427
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,625
[CHIHIRO]
Oh, sure!

428
00:20:29,833 --> 00:20:31,166
Wanna know something?

429
00:20:31,250 --> 00:20:32,291
The picture you had earlier

430
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:34,500
was the first one
Keiichiro ever took.

431
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,416
[gasps]

432
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,375
He always carries it with him.

433
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,166
That's pretty cool, huh?

434
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,958
[gasps, laughs]

435
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:42,916
[KEIICHIRO]
Are you ready?

436
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:43,750
[MIYAKO]
Yes!

437
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:44,791
[KEIICHIRO]
Big smiles!

438
00:20:44,875 --> 00:20:46,416
[shutter clicks]

439
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,166
[MADOKA]
Cinderfella! More tea, please!

440
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,625
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah, yeah.

441
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,000
It's hard to believe
how much you've grown.

442
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,208
Yes, I know. But I'm already 16.

443
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,958
I'll be grown up
before you know it.

444
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,250
How very true. Time does fly.

445
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,125
[CHIHIRO]
That's such a dad line!

446
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,125
Jeez, is he really that dense?

447
00:21:14,208 --> 00:21:18,041
To be fair, he has known her
since she was very young.

448
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,750
Even so, girls can surprise you.

449
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,833
They go and bloom
into beautiful flowers

450
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,000
in the blink of an eye,
and then he might

451
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:28,500
see things a little differently.

452
00:21:28,583 --> 00:21:29,666
When that day does come,

453
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:32,500
I'm going to give him
such a hard time!

454
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:35,458
Because I knew it all along.

455
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,916
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah, That'll be fun to see.

456
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,708
Hey, Chi!

457
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:46,958
[gasps]

458
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:50,041
[MADOKA] Where did you
get those horrid things?

459
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,708
Keiichiro printed up
some copies of them for me.

460
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:53,958
Aw, but why?

461
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,375
I might use them to deter evil.

462
00:21:56,458 --> 00:21:58,375
[MADOKA]
What? Are you talking about me?

463
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:01,416
How can you be so mean
to your favorite uncle?

464
00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:08,208
[barking]

465
00:22:10,583 --> 00:22:12,500
[giggles]

466

[ANTARO barking]

467
00:23:50,750 --> 00:23:51,916
[ANTARO barks]

468
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,833
[MIYAKO] What's that,
Antaro? You're hungry?

469
00:23:53,916 --> 00:23:55,375
Okay, here's your
dinner, darling!

470
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,166
[ANTARO barks]

471
00:23:56,250 --> 00:23:57,416
[CHIHIRO]
That's cool!

472
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,583
Can you understand what
all of his barks mean?

473
00:23:58,666 --> 00:23:59,833
[MIYAKO]
Yes!

474
00:23:59,916 --> 00:24:01,541
But usually it's just
things like, "Feed me!

475
00:24:01,625 --> 00:24:04,250
I'm starving!" Which is
pretty much all the time.

476
00:24:04,333 --> 00:24:05,333
[CHIHIRO]
Oh, really?

00:24:05,416 --> 00:24:07,083
[MIYAKO]
Then yesterday, he barked, "Hey!

478
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:08,625
Someone I don't know is here!"

479
00:24:08,708 --> 00:24:11,041
and it was the most amazing
thing he's ever said to me!

480
00:24:11,125 --> 00:24:12,708
[CHIHIRO]
I think that's kinda standard.

481
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:13,791
[ANTARO barks]

482
00:24:13,875 --> 00:24:14,958
[ANTARO]
Tune in next time for

483
00:24:15,041 --> 00:24:16,583
"A Man Never Goes
Back on His Word."

484
00:24:16,666 --> 00:24:18,458
[CHIHIRO]
He talked! Did he just talk?

485
00:24:18,541 --> 00:24:19,958
[ANTARO]
See you next week, woof!
