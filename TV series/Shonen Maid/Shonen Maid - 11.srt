160
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,375
I've heard they've been
at odds for years.

161
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,916
[HINO]
Oh yeah?

162
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,375
If that's what's going on,

163
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:23,791
I'm not sure that there's
anything we can do

164
00:08:23,875 --> 00:08:25,416
to solve the problem.

165
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,833
But maybe we could figure out
a way to cheer them up.

166
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:29,416
[HINO]
Mm.

167
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,166
What about getting
'em to leave the house

168
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,583
and have a little fun somewhere?

169
00:08:32,666 --> 00:08:34,208
[MIYAKO] I thought about that,
but when I brought up

170
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:36,583
going on a trip neither
of them seemed interested.

171
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,333
[HINO] They need
a change of pace.

172
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,041
[YOKO]
Wow! Can you believe that?

173
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,208
[MIE]
So awesome!

174
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,333
I asked you
to turn it down!

175
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,875
[MIE]
Cherry blossoms!

176
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,166
[YOKO] They're blooming
really early this year!

177
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:49,500
[NEWSCASTER] ...expected to
be in full bloom by next week.

178
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,041
Stay tuned for more weather...

179
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:53,250
That's it! The answer
to our prayers!

180
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:55,166
[MIE, YOKO]
Huh?

181
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,875
--[CHIHIRO] Flowers?
--[MIYAKO] Yes!

182
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:59,291
The cherry blossoms are
blooming early this year.

183
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,208
It's gotten warmer out,
so now would probably

184
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,041
be the perfect time to go.

185
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:06,250
We could pack a few lunches and
invite everyone to join us.

186
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:07,958
[CHIHIRO] I like the idea,
but I'm not sure

187
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,375
Madoka would be up for it.

188
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,333
Flower viewing can get crowded.

189
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,375
[MIYAKO] Eeh.
Yes. That's a good point.

190
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,125
We could host it
here in the garden.

191
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:19,291
Surely he wouldn't mind
inviting a few friends over.

192
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:22,833
[CHIHIRO] That might work,
if we had any cherry trees.

193
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,333
Fine! I'll just have to

194
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,583
bring a cherry
tree over here!

195
00:09:26,666 --> 00:09:29,583
Are you okay?

196
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:31,375
[MIYAKO] I'm sorry
that I lost my temper.

197
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,833
[CHIHIRO] It's not a big deal,
but is something wrong?

198
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:36,291
Hino asked for your help?

199
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,250
[MIYAKO] Yes. He noticed
that you seemed down

200
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,708
at school, and he got
a little worried about you.

201
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,166
Madoka looked sad too,

202
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:44,083
so we tried to make you
both feel better.

203
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,416
I'm really sorry!

204
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,750
No! It's okay!

205
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:49,125
I had no idea you guys
were so worried about us.

206
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,208
Honestly, I'm fine.

207
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,083
That's what Madoka said, too.

208
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:56,416
I hope you two are
being honest with me.

209
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,500
Sorry.

210
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,875
[MIYAKO]
Please, don't be!

211
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:00,541
I'm sorry for sticking
my nose into it.

212
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:04,583
I just-I want you
to remember something.

213
00:10:04,666 --> 00:10:06,083
There are a lot
of people around here

214
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,750
who only want the best for you.

215
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,541
I'm one of many friends
who love you.

216
00:10:11,625 --> 00:10:14,500
We care. Truly.

217
00:10:17,416 --> 00:10:20,166
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah. Thank you.

218
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:25,458
--[CHIHIRO] Dinners ready!
--[MADOKA] Coming!

219
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,458
Why isn't Miyako
staying to eat with us?

220
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,000
She said her dad
had a special dinner

221
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,833
prepared for them
and he'd be disappointed

222
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,666
if she didn't
get home in time.

223
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,583
Well, she's missing
a great meal.

224
00:10:38,666 --> 00:10:41,625
Thank you for the food.
It smells divine.

225
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:43,125
[MIYAKO]
Madoka looked sad too,

226
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:45,041
so we tried to make you
both feel better.

227
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:48,000
[CHIHIRO]
Does he really seem sad?

228
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:52,041
[MADOKA]
Mmm! It's great!

229
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,208
What's wrong?

230
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,583
It's nothing.
Really. Except.

231
00:10:55,666 --> 00:10:58,791
Miyako mentioned having a cherry
blossom viewing party here!

232
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:01,500
But we don't have any
cherry trees, do we?

233
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:04,083
Oh! She said that she
would bring one over for us.

234
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,708
[MADOKA]
Hmm.

235
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,416
How about it?

236
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:12,041
If you'd like to make it
happen, then let's do it.

237
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:22,291
[CHIHIRO]
That day.

238
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,666
What do you think
you're doing here?

239
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,541
What do you want?

240
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:27,916
[CHIHIRO] Looking back,
Madoka tells me stories

241
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,083
about Mom all of the time.

242
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,708
But when it comes
to his parents,

243
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,583
I've never heard him
say anything about them.

244
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,958
I guess... I don't know
much of anything about Madoka.

245
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:44,375
[MADOKA] Sis would make
the bento for us.

246
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,541
Usually weird rice balls and
burnt rolled omelets.

247
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,208
But to tell you the truth,

248
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:52,875
in spite of all that,
I actually liked her cooking.

249
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:59,166
[phone buzzes]

250
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:01,000
[chuckles]

251
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:05,333
[CHIHIRO] I'm gonna try to talk
to him more, about everything.

252
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,375

the warm weather...

255
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,416
You got a text!

256
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,833
Oh, it looks like
it's from a girl!

257
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:19,333
She wants to
look at the blossoms!

258
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:20,916
First date for Hino!

259
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,541
[HINO] It's not cool to snoop
around in other people's phones!

260
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,666
Oh wow! A flower viewing?

261
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:26,708
[HINO]
You're not invited!

[GUESTS gasp]

263
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:43,458
[MIYAKO] My mother let me
use one of her pots.

264
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,583
Best blossoms ever!

265
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,833
Don't you think you're
a little over-excited?

266
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,375
Thank you for being
such a good friend to Ryuji.

267
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:52,666
We thought we'd bring you
a little present.

268
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,250
You didn't have to.

269
00:12:54,333 --> 00:12:56,166
I made all of us a bento!

270
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,208
Seriously? You made this?

271
00:12:58,291 --> 00:12:59,916
Yeah! It was a lot of fun!

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,291
My mom couldn't
come with me,

273
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,125
but she sent some
inari rice balls!

274
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:05,041
And I brought
snacks and sodas!

275
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,916
We didn't forget about
Antaro either!

[MIYAKO]
Aww, that's sweet, thanks!

[ANTARO barks]

278
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:13,916
I assume Madoka's
still up in his room working?

279
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,541
[CHIHIRO]
Mhm.

280
00:13:16,625 --> 00:13:19,291
[MIYAKO] He won't stay
in there all day, will he?

281
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,041
I wouldn't worry about that.

282
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:22,791
I'm sure he'll
come poking around

283
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,583
as soon as he's hungry enough.

284
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,166
Well in that case,
I'll make sure to save him

285
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:27,958
a huge helping of everything!

286
00:13:28,041 --> 00:13:29,583
Hey guys!
Can we go ahead

287
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,416
and get the party started?
I'm starving here.

288
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:34,708
You could try using
some manners, you know.

289
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:36,875
Ryuji's right.
We should start eating now.

What's with the truck?

294
00:13:47,208 --> 00:13:49,083
I thought it'd be
obvious, kiddo.

295
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,875
Well, you can't have
a flower viewing

296
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:54,916
without the main
attraction! Take a look!

297
00:13:59,666 --> 00:14:02,875

his way out of a paper bag!

[KOJI]
That wasn't too bad!

316
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,791
[CHIHIRO] Maybe it's
a little too lively?

317
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:49,041
Chihiro?
It was me. Mrs. Takatori.

318
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:52,041
I was the one who told her
where your mother was buried.

319
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:54,791
I should have
asked first. I'm sorry.

320
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:56,250
I'm not upset about that.

321
00:14:56,333 --> 00:15:00,458
No need to apologize.
I was confused.

322
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:03,375
I have to admit I was
really surprised she was there.

323
00:15:03,458 --> 00:15:06,208
I've never seen Madoka
so angry before.

324
00:15:06,291 --> 00:15:08,500
Yes. I've known them
a long time,

325
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,458
and their relationship
has always been turbulent,

326
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,125
you see.

327
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:13,916
[CHIHIRO]
It is because of my mom?

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,041
I don't think so.

329
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,916
It's been this way
since we were kids.

330
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,208
I wonder why.

331
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:24,500
Mrs. Takatori may come off
as cold to many people,

332
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:27,958
but I'd like to believe
there is more to her than that.

333
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,416
[CHIHIRO]
Me too.

We hate to rush off, but we
have rehearsal tonight.

This afternoon
was really wonderful.

[MATSUKI] I hope we
didn't miss anything fun.

Glad you came.

Hi, Komiya.

We have a question for you.

Who were those guys?

00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,458
Oh! Madoka's clients?

[HINO] Haven't you ever
heard of cosplay?

355

You should be touched
by all the work

this party a success!

You better come down now

or there won't
be any food left!

364
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:40,083
It's really delicious.
I'd hate for you to miss out.

365
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,375
Miyako made all kinds
of things for us.

366
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:45,000
Hino's grandpa even brought us
a huge cherry tree.

367
00:16:45,083 --> 00:16:48,791
It's all pretty amazing.

368
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:52,000
I cooked rolled omelets.

369
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,583
They're good.

370
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,500
Probably the best ones
I've ever made.

for me to stop sulking.

Madoka, you're here!

378

Come right this way!

[MADOKA] Keiichiro,
are you drunk?

382
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,000
Yep! Time to cut loose
and have fun!

383

00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,333
Yeah!

[CHIHIRO]
Madoka, here.

388
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,541
Try eating a rolled omelet
before you get too full.

389
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:42,250
Don't mind if I do!
Let's see. Yum!

390
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:45,208
Well?

391
00:17:45,291 --> 00:17:46,541
They taste even better
than the last time

392
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:47,625
you made them!

393
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:48,833
Really?

394
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:49,958
I think they'd reach
perfection if they were

395
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,958
maybe just a little
bit fluffier.

396
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:53,666
So you'd like
them to be lighter.

397
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,833
I can do that.

398

Yes! A revolution!

from the saké?

You need to rest.

Thank you, Chi.

[MADOKA]
I'm sorry.

411
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,916
When we visited
Chiyo's grave,

412
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:39,291
I was not prepared to see
my mother there like that.

413
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:40,791
[CHIHIRO] Keiichiro told me
that you've always

414
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,458
had problems with her.

415
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:44,166
There's nothing you need
to apologize about.

00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:47,000
--There isn't?
--Not really.

417
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:49,708
To be honest, I always
thought people from

418
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,291
the main family
seemed pretty cold.

419
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:54,500
I promised myself
that if I ever met them,

420
00:18:54,583 --> 00:18:56,416
I'd give them
a piece of my mind.

421
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:58,958
I wanted to defend Mom
because she had nobody,

422
00:18:59,041 --> 00:19:02,416
so I would demand to know why
they weren't in our lives.

423
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:05,208
I convinced myself
that they were cruel.

424
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:08,333
I guess that sounds
pretty heartless.

425
00:19:08,416 --> 00:19:10,416
Not at all.

426
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:14,291
[CHIHIRO] I actually
met her before that day.

427
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:18,208
It's funny. Deep down I wished
she was my grandma,

428
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:23,583
so when I found out the truth
I didn't know what to feel.

429
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,458
It's bittersweet.

430
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,833
[MADOKA] Really? Well, I can't
promise that I'll ever like her.

471
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:32,583
Sixth graders,
please help all of

472
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,958
our newer students
to find their way!

473
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:37,208
Aw man, it's like
we're babysitters.

474
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,250
Ready? Let's go.

475
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:41,333
I wonder what kind of
assignments we'll have.

476
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:44,125
Yeah, I bet the
field trips will be cool.

477
00:21:47,041 --> 00:21:49,958
[CHIHIRO] Mom, I made it
to the sixth grade.

478
00:21:50,041 --> 00:21:52,208
I promise. I'll work hard
to be a good friend

479
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:56,333
to everyone I know,
even Madoka.

480
00:21:56,416 --> 00:21:59,208
There's no need
for you to worry, Mom!

481
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:03,458
[HINO] Komiya! We're going
inside! You coming?

482
00:22:03,541 --> 00:22:06,083
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah!

483
00:23:51,833 --> 00:23:54,125
[CHIYO] Oh, Chihiro,
you're growing up so fast!

484
00:23:54,208 --> 00:23:55,708
[CHIHIRO] Mom?
What are you doing here?

485
00:23:55,791 --> 00:23:57,083
[CHIYO] Well, the preview
doesn't count

486
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,041
so there's really no need
to ask questions!

487
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,291
[CHIHIRO]
I can't ignore this!

488
00:24:00,375 --> 00:24:01,750
[CHIYO]
You should be excited!

489
00:24:01,833 --> 00:24:03,875
It's finally time
for the grand finale!

490
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:04,916
[CHIHIRO]
This can't be the end!

491
00:24:05,000 --> 00:24:06,416
I still have so much
left to clean!

492
00:24:06,500 --> 00:24:08,750
[CHIYO] All good things must
come to an end, Chihiro.

493
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,583
Don't cry that it's over,
just be glad that it happened!

494
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,166
[CHIHIRO] That sounds
like a greeting card!

495
00:24:13,250 --> 00:24:15,583
[CHIYO] Next episode,
<i>Shonen Maid</i> bids you farewell

496
00:24:15,666 --> 00:24:17,375
with "All's Well
That Ends Well."

497
00:24:17,458 --> 00:24:18,875
[CHIYO, CHIHIRO]
See you then!
