Can you turn that alarm off?

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,916
I'm trying to sleep.

Maybe try taking

you trying to say?

some sort of degenerate.

brought in another cat.

I'm not sure where
he found a kitten.

00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,250
I would say it's about
a month old and male.

He's a black short-hair.

One white paw and blue eyes.
Yes, it's very cute.

Thank you again for your help
and we'll see you soon.

I have to ask.
How many more times

51

must we go through this?

52

You aren't allowed to

try to rescue every stray

end up in the hospital.

to use you as a substitute

If you so much as
look at them wrong,

and attack you!

put this on first?

You probably should
have just kept walking.

with it when someone

would have taken
it home eventually.

I couldn't just
leave it like that.

I hope you at least found
a good hiding spot for it.

noticed anything.

is someplace else.

I put those cat ears on him
yesterday; he didn't bat an eye.

He may still be adjusting
to all the changes.

to get him to open up

told you sooner.

00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:05,708
[CHIHIRO] You don't even
clean up after yourself.

162
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:09,625
[knocking]

163
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:10,666
[MADOKA]
I knocked!

164
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,916
I thought a sleepover
might be fun

165
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,750
now that we've made... up....

166
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:14,708
[barks]

167
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,416
[yells]

168
00:08:17,500 --> 00:08:20,083
[CHIHIRO] A sleepover might
be fun with the three of us.

169
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:22,291
Is that okay?

170
00:08:22,375 --> 00:08:24,166
[MADOKA] He'll eat me
as soon as I shut my eyes!

171
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,541
Lately I've been
letting this little guy

172
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:26,875
sleep in the bed
with me at night.

173
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,666
So you have to be careful
when you climb in, okay?

174
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,875
Why does that fleabag
get priority over me?

175
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,416
This is ridiculous!

176
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,958
[CHIHIRO] Come back here,
boy! Where'd you go?

177
00:08:39,041 --> 00:08:40,500
[barks]

178
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,625
[CHIHIRO]
Thought I lost ya for a second.

179
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,833
It's so overgrown.

180
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:49,208
The gardeners sure have their
work cut out for them today.

181
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:50,416
[doorbell buzzes]

182
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,500
Ah, I'm coming!

183
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:55,083
[HINO] Hey there!
Hino Landscaping here!

184
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:55,958
You got a job?

185
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,541
No way. Who knew?

186
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,750
[HINO laughs]
You don't think I can handle it?

187
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:02,791
[GRANDPA HINO] Manners!
Be respectful to the clients!

188
00:09:02,875 --> 00:09:04,083
How ya doin', Chihiro?

189
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,708
It's been a while, hasn't it?

190
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:08,000
Yeah! It's great to see you!

191
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:09,125
[GRANDPA HINO]
What a mess.

192
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:10,041
From the looks of this place,

193
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,625
we've got a full
day ahead of us.

194
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:13,916
I guess the master of the house
has more important things to do

195
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,375
than pull up some weeds.

196
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:16,625
[MADOKA]
Is that so?

197
00:09:16,708 --> 00:09:19,250
I had no idea you were
the gardener's grandson.

198
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:20,541
It's a small world after all.

199
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:22,708
I help out sometimes.

200
00:09:22,791 --> 00:09:23,916
Shouldn't you head
back over then?

201
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,583
As long as Chihiro
keeps him company

202
00:09:25,666 --> 00:09:28,166
I'm gonna take
it easy. It's funny.

203
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:30,291
Those two have always gotten
along with each other.

204
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,625
[MADOKA]
I wonder why...

205
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:34,416
[gasps] It's the goatee!

206
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,291
[HINO] I don't think that's it.
And you couldn't pull it off.

207
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:38,791
Aw...

208
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,791
You two must be getting
a lot closer lately, huh?

209
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,125
Do you really think so?

210
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:44,583
Sure, I mean he sneaked
that puppy in the house.

211
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,791
He'd have to feel
pretty comfortable

212
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,083
around here to try that.

213
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:49,416
[KEIICHIRO]
Now listen here.

214
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,666
Things would go much
smoother if you'd cooperate!

215
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,375
[HINO] Honestly, I've never
seen him let loose like that.

216
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:58,125
Chihiro's usually too
high-strung to take many risks.

217
00:09:58,208 --> 00:10:00,458
In my experience,
he's mostly angry.

218
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:02,875
Between you and me, I think
he's big control freak.

219
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,250
[CHIHIRO]
Hino!

220
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,333
You need to go get the
fertilizer out of the truck!

221
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:07,666
'Kay.

222
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:08,916
[CHIHIRO] Grandpa just said
he's taking your cut

223
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,791
if you don't start helping!

224
00:10:09,875 --> 00:10:12,708
Uh-- Coming! Wait, do what now?

225
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,416
[CHIHIRO]
Seriously?

226
00:10:16,708 --> 00:10:18,291
[GRANDPA HINO] I've been tryin'
to teach that boy the value

227
00:10:18,375 --> 00:10:19,833
of a hard day's work.

228
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:21,166
I wish he'd learn even a little

229
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:23,666
from your example, I mean,
you're giving your all,

230
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:26,000
even while wearing that
pretty maid outfit.

231
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:27,708
That's impressive dedication!

232
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:31,375
Dedication. Yeah. Thanks a lot.

233
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:32,500
Always thought that young fella

234
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:34,250
who owned this
place was eccentric.

235
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,916
Who could've guessed he was
Chiyo's little brother?

236
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,250
I have to tell you.

237
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:39,708
The wife and I had been
discussing whether or not

238
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:41,250
we should take you in.

239
00:10:42,833 --> 00:10:44,000
Huh?

240
00:10:44,083 --> 00:10:45,000
[GRANDPA HINO]
Hino said that you didn't have

241
00:10:45,083 --> 00:10:46,375
any other family members.

242
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:49,708
If you need anything at all,
just let me know, okay?

243
00:10:49,791 --> 00:10:51,750
[CHIHIRO]
He really meant it.

244
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,541
The offer still stands
if you ever wanna come.

245
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,750
--[CHIHIRO] Huh?
--[MADOKA gasps]

246
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,375
We love a full house!

247
00:10:56,458 --> 00:10:58,750
It's great having kids around.
Right now we have six of them.

248
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,958
Plus three dogs, if pets
are up your alley!

249
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,125
[laughs]

250
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:06,250
Wow. I don't even
know what to say.

251
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,666
Thanks, but... I think
I'd like to stay here.

252
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:10,833
[gasps]

253
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,041
If I left,

254
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,750
the house I've been
working so hard to clean

255
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:16,041
would probably
end up messy again.

256
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,541
And I can't believe
I have my own room.

257
00:11:18,625 --> 00:11:20,208
I've sorta gotten
used to seeing Madoka

258
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:21,875
and Keiichiro every day.

259
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:25,291
Thanks a lot for the offer,
but this is home.

260
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,541
That's just fine.
I'm happy for you.

261
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:31,541
[laughs]

262
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:33,500
Well, keep 'em in line!

263
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,250
[gasps]

264
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,250
[MIYAKO]
You're adorable!

265
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,833
Like a cute little
bean bun filled with <i>anko</i> !

266
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:53,125
You're so sweet!

267
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,916
So, I have no choice
but to call you...

268
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,375
Antaro!

269
00:11:57,458 --> 00:11:58,500
[barks]

270
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,250
[MIYAKO laughs]

271
00:12:02,583 --> 00:12:03,791
[CHIHIRO]
And just like that,

272
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,333
he had found himself an owner!

273
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:06,250
[HINO]
Whoa!

274
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:07,958
[AMAHARA, TAKEI]
A happy ending!

275
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:09,125
I bet you're still kinda bummed

276
00:12:09,208 --> 00:12:10,500
that you couldn't
keep it though.

277
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:13,250
[CHIHIRO laughs] To be honest,
I don't think Madoka

278
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:14,791
was handling the
stress very well.

279
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,000
[screams]

280
00:12:16,083 --> 00:12:17,500
He probably felt
like he was trapped

281
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:18,708
inside a haunted house!

282
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:20,500
Considering how he's
scared of dogs,

283
00:12:20,583 --> 00:12:22,875
it was really cool he let you
keep the puppy in the house

284
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:24,375
while you looked
for a new owner.

285
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:25,625
[gasps]

286
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:30,083
That was pretty cool.

287
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,208
I don't even remember taking
the time to say thank you.

288
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:34,375
[MADOKA]
I said no!

289
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,458
I'm not going anywhere
and that's final.

290
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:38,375
[KEIICHIRO] You can pout all
you want, but the arrangements

291
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,583
have already been made.

292
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,208
It would be in bad taste
to change them now.

293
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,708
I didn't even know about this.

294
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,250
Feign ignorance, but I confirmed

295
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:45,750
all this with you
twice last week.

296
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,500
I see you weren't even
listening, were you?

297
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,708
What's going on in here?

298
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,583
Master Madoka believes
if he whines enough

299
00:12:50,666 --> 00:12:52,541
he won't have to go
on this business trip.

300
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,125
[CHIHIRO]
A business trip? When?

301
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,375
Today.

302
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,708
[CHIHIRO] Huh?! If you
have somewhere to go,

303
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,625
why are you sitting around here?

304
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:01,833
Stop whining, hurry up,
and go change your clothes!

305
00:13:04,791 --> 00:13:07,083
Why must you be
so cruel to me, Chi?

306
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,458
This isn't him.

307
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,250
Making a good first
impression is essential.

308
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,500
I'm being sent away
for three whole days.

309
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:15,625
But I want you to know,
you're going to be just fine.

310
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,958
I'll try to find the will
to survive without you.

311
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,416
I almost forgot.
I have something for you.

312
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,833
It's a hand-me-down,
but it still works.

313
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:24,916
You're giving me a cell phone?

314
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,958
[MADOKA]
Always try to keep it with you.

315
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,000
You can call any time
you need, okay?

316
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,833
Morning, afternoon,
even late at night.

317

[CHIHIRO]
I won't call.

318
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,166
Now try to relax
and do your job.

00:13:35,250 --> 00:13:36,750
I don't wanna!

320
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,250
[KEIICHIRO]
Goodbye, Chihiro!

321
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:39,875
Thank you for taking care of
the house while we're away.

322
00:13:39,958 --> 00:13:41,208
Somebody call the police!

323
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:43,875
I'm being taken against my will!

324
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,083
[CHIHIRO]
I'm all alone.

325
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,791
I can't believe how
silent this place

326
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,500
is when there's nobody around.

327
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,916
I feel...

328
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:06,083
...so excited to clean
without anybody bothering me!

329
00:14:06,166 --> 00:14:07,750
I'll start with the drains
and ventilation fans

330
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,000
in the kitchen,

331
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,458
then I'll wash all the
windows on the terrace!

332
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:11,958
They'll be sparkling!

333
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:13,125
Oh, yeah!

334
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:15,125
I can do the curtains
and cushions, too!

335
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,208
I'm so ready for this. Woo-hoo!

336
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,833
[CHIHIRO sneezes]

337
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:22,375
So, you're telling me
you took a bath

338
00:14:22,458 --> 00:14:25,041
and got so busy cleaning
afterwards, you caught a cold?

339
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,833
I got a little carried away.

340
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,416
I could have sworn
I saw a bit of mold

341
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,000
between some of the tiles.

342
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,833
I started scrubbing and before
I knew it, it was midnight.

343
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:33,833
[CHIHIRO sneezes]

344
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,500
Sounds like you.
I'm not surprised.

345
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,666
You said you'll be on
your own a few more days.

346
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,166
Should I worry
about your sanity?

347
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:40,125
No, I'll be fine.

348
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,958
I pushed myself too hard is all.

349
00:14:42,041 --> 00:14:43,083
Is there any way
you could teach me

350
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,166
how to use this thing?

351
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,416
A cell phone?

352
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,958
[CHIHIRO] Madoka gave
it to me before he left,

353
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:48,500
but I don't know
what to do with it.

354
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:51,333
It hasn't stopped beeping
at me since last night.

It's not like I
want him to baby me!

[HINO] What are you so
upset about, you sweet child?

[CHIHIRO]
Don't call me that!

[CHIHIRO]
Hey, I'm home!

369
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,583
It's kinda weird coming
home with nobody here.

370
00:15:29,666 --> 00:15:31,583
I'm not used to it
being so quiet.

shift that mannequin

a little to the right?

in the spotlight.

happen, won't you?

anything better to do?

What a weirdo!

So, Hino said just press reply.

00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:39,375
What's the point of even
telling him about it right now?

391
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:41,166
[TAKEI] Considering how
he's scared of dogs,

392
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:43,500
it was really cool he let you
keep the puppy in the house

while you looked
for a new owner.

just go back to cleaning.

eating earlier.

that meal because

I couldn't fully enjoy it
while worrying about home.

to take care of a dog

476
00:20:58,208 --> 00:20:59,833
when I'm always
cleaning up after you.

477
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:00,958
Oh, I see.

478
00:21:01,041 --> 00:21:03,541
I apologize for all the trouble.

479
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:05,000
Listen.

480
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:08,333
It means a lot that you let
the dog stay here at all.

481
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,250
So thank you.

482
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,541
Uh--

483
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:11,750
[sighs]

484
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,833
It was nothing.

485
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:27,375
[MADOKA humming]

486
00:21:27,458 --> 00:21:28,708
Oh! Good morning!

487
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,541
I hope you're hungry,
because this rice porridge

488
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:31,916
is almost ready!

489
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,041
You're kidding me.

490
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,750
Is this what it's like
to have déjà vu?

491
00:21:34,833 --> 00:21:36,958
[laughs]

492
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,458
Seems like your fever went down.

493
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:41,958
What a relief.

494
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:43,208
What about work?

495
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,416
Aren't they expecting you
to get back there?

496
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:46,916
Uh-- It's no problem!

497
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,125
I handled everything.

498
00:21:48,208 --> 00:21:50,208
You got out of it after all.

499
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,208
[laughs] If the shoe fits!

500
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:55,875
[MADOKA]
I'm leaving the rest to you!

501
00:21:55,958 --> 00:21:57,000
When push comes to shove,

502
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,125
feel free to use
this if you need.

503
00:22:01,416 --> 00:22:02,583
When he gets home,
he's going to be

504
00:22:02,666 --> 00:22:03,958
really angry with me,
so I need you

505
00:22:04,041 --> 00:22:05,791
to play up the sickness, okay?

506
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:06,875
No way!

507
00:22:06,958 --> 00:22:08,333
All you did was gripe
about that trip!

508
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,166
You probably got me
sick on purpose!

509
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:11,291
[MADOKA]
What are you saying?

510
00:22:11,375 --> 00:22:12,625
I'm the innocent one here!

511
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:13,500
[CHIHIRO]
Sure you are!

512
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:15,208
You owe both of us an apology!

513
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:52,083
[KEIICHIRO]
Chihiro.

514
00:23:52,166 --> 00:23:53,541
I'm very happy to hear that
you're feeling better now.

515
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:54,875
[CHIHIRO]
Thanks a lot, Keiichiro!

516
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,750
How did things go at the
bridal fair after he left?

517
00:23:56,833 --> 00:23:58,000
[KEIICHIRO]
All right.

518
00:23:58,083 --> 00:23:59,458
I put on the terrible
wig Madoka left for me

519
00:23:59,541 --> 00:24:01,041
and said "Thank you
all so much!"

520
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:03,083
and a few other things
in an annoying voice.

521
00:24:03,166 --> 00:24:04,750
[CHIHIRO] I still can't
believe he expects you to do

522
00:24:04,833 --> 00:24:06,250
stuff like that.

523
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:07,708
[KEIICHIRO] I do what I have to,
to fulfill my obligations,

524
00:24:07,791 --> 00:24:09,083
but if he ever wants
to me do something

525
00:24:09,166 --> 00:24:11,583
like that again, I'll stuff
the wig down his throat.

526
00:24:11,666 --> 00:24:13,250
[CHIHIRO] I really feel
for you, Keiichiro.

527
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:14,750
Putting all that
aside, next time is

528
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:16,333
"What One Likes,
One Will Do Well"!

529
00:24:16,416 --> 00:24:17,708
[KEIICHIRO]
Everyone.

530
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,041
We would be pleased to have
you join us again soon!

531
00:24:19,125 --> 00:24:20,041
[CHIHIRO]
Please do!
