1
00:00:11,041 --> 00:00:14,333
[MADOKA]
Hmm. Pink or blue.

2
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:19,583
I can't decide.
Pink or blue?

3
00:00:19,666 --> 00:00:23,416
Chi, I wonder,
which do you think:

4
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,833
is pink better than blue?

5
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,500
Yellow.

6
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:28,916
[MADOKA]
Interesting...

7
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,625
Hmm. Perhaps saffron.

8
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:35,208
Saffron: that's crazy.

9
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:36,791
So do I even wanna know?

10
00:00:36,875 --> 00:00:38,541
Oh, he's just
in creative mode.

11
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,541
I really wouldn't worry
about it too much.

12
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:43,583
Instead, worry about this
problem you missed.

13
00:00:43,666 --> 00:00:46,250
We can't all be
math whizzes.

14
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,958
What kind of stuff is
he even working on anyway?

15
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,875
More idol outfits?

16
00:00:50,958 --> 00:00:54,333
[CHIHIRO] Nope. This time
it's wedding dresses.

17
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:57,625
[MADOKA]
Yellow...?

18
00:02:29,625 --> 00:02:31,291
[CHIHIRO]
Good morning, Keiichiro!

19
00:02:31,375 --> 00:02:33,375
Well, good morning to you!

20
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,791
[CHIHIRO] Is it just me,
or does Madoka

21
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,583
seem busier than usual?

22
00:02:36,666 --> 00:02:39,416
[KEIICHIRO] Spring is always
a hectic time for him.

23
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,791
But this year has been a bit
more problematic than normal.

24
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:44,041
[BRIDE 12A]
I got fat.

25
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,416
[BRIDE 12B]
I lost ten pounds!

26
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,333
[BRIDE 12C] We moved
the ceremony to next week!

27
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:50,333
[BRIDE 12D] My dress has
to look better than hers!

28
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:54,166
And you just can't say no
to a woman in bridezilla mode.

29
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,083
Sounds scary.

30
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:59,750
Oh! Hello.
Want something to eat?

31
00:02:59,833 --> 00:03:02,375
Sure thing. I've decided
on pink after all.

32
00:03:02,458 --> 00:03:04,333
Okay?

33
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,916
[CHIHIRO] On second thought,
maybe I'll make him

34
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,833
a bento so he can
eat in his workroom.

35
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:12,125
He really is impossible.
Sorry for the trouble.

36
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:14,833
Oh please,
I'm used to it by now!

37
00:03:18,833 --> 00:03:21,458
--All right.
--[MADOKA] Here, Chi.

38
00:03:21,541 --> 00:03:22,833
It was great, thanks!

39
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,166
[CHIHIRO]
You can leave it there.

40
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,708
Are you going to
eat dinner with me?

41
00:03:25,791 --> 00:03:27,416
[MADOKA] Mmm.
I just finished eating,

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,750
so probably not. Sorry.

43
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:32,000
It's fine, I'll make you
a snack for later

44
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:33,458
in case you get hungry.

45
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:35,541
[MADOKA]
Oh! Thank you!

46
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,916
Well, it looks
like he ate everything.

47
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,291
That's good, I guess.

48
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,875

You can do it!

Hello there!

[CHIHIRO] Oh, hi!
Where'd you come from?

Whoa. Who is this girl?

55
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:40,666
She seems familiar somehow.

[CHIHIRO]
Madoka, Madoka!

00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,375
Oh. Morning.

62
00:05:05,458 --> 00:05:07,500
[CHIHIRO] Wouldn't your bed
be more comfortable?

63
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:09,375
Yes. Suppose it would,

64
00:05:09,458 --> 00:05:11,291
but then I'd
probably fall asleep.

65
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:12,666
[CHIHIRO]
That's the point!

66
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:14,916
What time is it?

67
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,208
You feel like you might
be running a fever.

68
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:22,541
You think so?

69
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,125
That's funny,
I don't feel sick.

70
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:25,125
But still.

71
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,500
Don't worry,
I'm seriously fine!

72
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,333
Oh and thank you
for making that bento!

'Kay, back to work!

touched his food.

[indistictive chatter]

76
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:46,833
[CHIHIRO] I wonder if these
cooling sheets actually work.

77
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:49,125
Maybe I should
buy some medicine, too.

78
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:52,375
I don't think he said anything
about his head hurting, though.

79
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,583
Then maybe
just an energy drink?

80
00:05:54,666 --> 00:05:56,375
I wonder which one's best.

00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:59,083
Why hello, Chihiro!
Need some help?

[gasps]

83
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,166
[CHIHIRO] Madoka doesn't
really seem to have much

84
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:08,708
of an appetite today, but he
needs to eat something.

85
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,083
Don't people eat soup
when they're sick?

I've never had to take care
of anyone before now.

00:06:57,875 --> 00:07:01,916
Fine. How's stuff with you?

97
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,625
[sighs] How is it you
always manage to catch me

in an awkward moment?

Aww. It's not fair.

That white cat is always
escaping from you, isn't it?

102
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,333
Indeed. It's a very
skittish creature.

103
00:07:22,416 --> 00:07:24,708
Anyway, are you out
running errands today?

104
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,791
Yes ma'am. I was buying
some medicine for Madoka.

105
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:29,166
I've known
them a long time,

106
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:31,791
and their relationship has
always been turbulent.

[gasps]

108
00:07:33,625 --> 00:07:35,833
I see. I suppose
he hasn't changed much

109
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:38,375
these past years.

110
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:40,250
I'd hoped that by now
he might finally

111
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,833
have his act together.

112
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:45,375
When he was little,
every time the seasons changed

113
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,708
he would manage to get sick.

114
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,208
I'd hate for him to cause
too much trouble for you.

[CHIHIRO] He's not! Madoka has
been super busy with work,

119
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,041
so I decided to help him out.

120
00:08:06,125 --> 00:08:08,958
It's not like he's laid up
in bed or anything.

Well, that's good to hear.

I wanted to ask why she
and Madoka don't get along.

And I wanted to ask how
she really feels about Mom.

I've got it, thanks.

along with some pictures.

Well that's cool!
She looks so pretty!

Tell me, have you ever

158

been to a wedding before?

gorgeous than that picture.

161
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,958
It's like...
there's this happy aura

162
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,708
surrounding everyone
in attendance.

163
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:37,125
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah?

164
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,166
It is beautiful
and I believe a woman

165
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:42,291
shines her brightest
on her wedding day.

166
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,833
So that's why...

167
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:46,916
...they're so darn picky
about every minute detail.

168
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,083
[CHIHIRO] Oh yeah,
makes perfect sense.

169
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,791
Heh. Not really.

170
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,041
But no matter what,
I will always do my best

171
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,708
to make their wishes a reality.

172
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:00,958
[MIYAKO] It's perfect,
thank you so much, Madoka!

173
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,458
[HANAKO]
Yay, Maddy! I love it!

174
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,166
[BRIDE 12E] It's exactly
what I wanted!

175
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,041
Come here.
Let me see your head!

176
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:12,791
[MADOKA groans]

177
00:11:12,875 --> 00:11:14,958
[CHIHIRO] I got this, too.
It's medicine.

178
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:17,333
If your fever doesn't
go down, take some.

179
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,208
And drink this.

180
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,666
It's full of
nutrition and stuff,

181
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:21,875
so it'll keep you
going if you're not

182
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,208
hungry enough to eat.

183
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:26,375
I also bought some gelatin
and put it in the fridge,

184
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:29,083
but if you want something
hot, let me know.

185
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,041
You may talk a big game,
but you're sick

186
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,541
and you need to
take care of yourself!

187
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:35,541
I'm glad you're working
hard for others,

188
00:11:35,625 --> 00:11:37,708
but your health
is important too!

189
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,166
You got that?

190
00:11:39,250 --> 00:11:41,041
Yes.

191
00:11:45,791 --> 00:11:48,166
And if you need something,
you'd better ask me!

192
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,875
[MADOKA]
Yes, sir.

193
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,791
Okay!

194
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,458
Thank you.

195
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,625
[AMAHARA] Hey, wanna
play games at my place?

196
00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,541
Sorry, I can't today.

197
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:18,250
Why, 'cause Madoka's
still super busy with work?

198
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,375
Mhm! Next time
for sure, though!

199
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:21,708
--Yep!
--Go get 'em!

200
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,416
Yeah, good luck!

201
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:27,166
[BOTH gasp]

202
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:28,875
Sorry, I didn't see you there!

203
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,708
[CHIHIRO] Is there more
to carry? I'll help you!

204
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,666
[KEIICHIRO]
Great, thanks a lot!

205
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,250
[KEIICHIRO]
That one is heavy.

206
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:41,916
[CHIHIRO]
I noticed!

207
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,958
[CHIHIRO] Keiichiro, wait!
Don't forget your jacket!

208
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,000
Ah, thank you!

209
00:12:47,375 --> 00:12:49,375
[CHIHIRO]
Drive safely!

210
00:12:49,458 --> 00:12:51,833
[exhales]

211
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:57,125
[CHIHIRO yells]

212
00:12:57,208 --> 00:13:01,333
Madoka! Please!
Speak to me!

213
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,916
I'm finished...

214
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,750
...with my work!

215
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:06,708
You mean it?

216
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:09,750
Yup. I'm pretty sure anyway.

217
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,916
[BOTH]
Hooray!

218
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,583
Let's sleep forever.

219
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,125
[CHIHIRO] Don't sleep
in the hallway!

220
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:24,875
[knock, knock]

221
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:28,875
[CHIHIRO] Madoka?
I made you some soup.

222
00:13:28,958 --> 00:13:42,625
Um...

223
00:13:42,708 --> 00:13:44,875
[CHIHIRO]
Madoka?

224
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,125
What are you doing?

225
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,583
I thought you were
done with work.

226
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:51,625
[MADOKA] Oh, I am.
This was for Chiyo.

227
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,041
[CHIHIRO]
For my mom?

228
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:56,833
Yes. It was the very
first dress I ever made.

229
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:58,750
I've remade it so many times.

230
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:01,125
It barely resembles
the original design.

231
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:04,125
This is probably version
five hundred and three.

232
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,625
[CHIHIRO] Can you really
call it the first dress

233
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:07,416
you ever made, then?

234
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,666
[MADOKA chuckles]

235
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:13,583
I'm not crazy. I know
she's never going to wear it.

236
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:17,750
But this time of year, I like to
bring it out and look at it.

237
00:14:24,291 --> 00:14:25,625
Mom told me
that she and Dad

238
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,750
didn't have a wedding ceremony.

239
00:14:27,833 --> 00:14:29,041
[MADOKA]
True.

240
00:14:29,125 --> 00:14:31,541
So there aren't
any pictures.

241
00:14:31,625 --> 00:14:33,458
[MADOKA]
I know.

242
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:34,833
[CHIHIRO]
For what it's worth,

243
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,458
I think this would've
looked great on her.

244
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:42,375
[CHIYO]
Isn't it beautiful, Madoka?

245
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:44,666
[MADOKA] Do you want
a dress like this?

246
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,125
[CHIYO] Yes, definitely.
When I get married!

247
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,250
Okay, then I'll
make it for you!

248
00:14:50,333 --> 00:14:51,500
[CHIYO]
Huh?

249
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:54,208
Don't worry!
I promise, it'll be perfect!

250
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:56,958
[CHIYO] Really? I hope
I'll be pretty in it!

251
00:14:57,041 --> 00:14:59,333
Just like Mom was!

252
00:14:59,416 --> 00:15:01,208
[MADOKA]
Uh!

253
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:03,958
--[CHIHIRO] Something wrong?
--[MADOKA] Nothing at all.

254
00:15:04,041 --> 00:15:05,750
By the way, Madoka

255
00:15:05,833 --> 00:15:08,000
--[MADOKA] Hm?
--[CHIHIRO] Jab.

256
00:15:08,083 --> 00:15:09,916
[CHIHIRO] You can worry about
that when you're not sick!

257
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,791
Back to bed!

258
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,541
Chi, what's the matter?

259
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,166
Well uh, it just seems
like a waste, is all.

260
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,416
What's a waste?

261
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,166
You know, the dress for
no one to ever wear it.

262
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,791
[laughs]

263
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,875
I'll just save it for your
wedding day then.

264
00:15:31,958 --> 00:15:33,166
Sound good?

265
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,916
Uh, no! And that's
way in the future!

266
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,666
[MADOKA] Do you think so?
Time has a way of flying.

267
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,833
Who said I'll even get
married in the first place?

268
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:41,000
[MADOKA] Well, if you
don't get married,

269
00:15:41,083 --> 00:15:42,708
I'll make you wear
the dress as a penalty.

270
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:43,875
It's a win-win!

271
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:45,458
[CHIHIRO]
What? That's not fair!

272
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:47,500
[MADOKA chuckles]

273
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,583
[MADOKA]
Thanks for dinner!

274
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,416
[CHIHIRO] Okay,
time to get some rest!

275
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,583
[MADOKA]
Yes, mother.

276
00:15:57,666 --> 00:16:00,583
[CHIHIRO] Where'd the
cooling sheets go?

277
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:02,291
I had them
in my workroom.

278
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:03,583
[CHIHIRO]
Seriously?

279
00:16:03,666 --> 00:16:05,166
[thud]

280
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:07,583
You hear that? I think
something hit the window.

281
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,458
[CHIHIRO]
Huh?

282
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:11,166
You're probably
delusional from fever

283
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,375
and lack of sleep,
so close your eyes!

284
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:16,583
[MADOKA]
Fine. Good night, Chi.

285
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:18,333
Sleep well.

286
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:23,125
[CHIHIRO] Let's see, where
are those cooling sheets?

287
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:24,416
Ugh!

288
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,958
Ow! Man, why is
he so friggin' messy?

289
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,541
Where are they?

290
00:16:32,916 --> 00:16:38,000
[CHIHIRO] That's them!
Thanks a lot!

291
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:42,500
[CHIYO laughs]

292
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,541
Surely... I'm just...
hearing things?

293
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,333
[yells]

294
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:53,458
[CHIYO laughs]

295
00:16:53,541 --> 00:16:55,750
[CHIHIRO screams]

296
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,583
[panting]

297
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,041
Ah!

298
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,625
Hey, quiet down.

299
00:17:01,708 --> 00:17:03,958
[CHIHIRO] Did you
turn the lights on?

300
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:05,833
[thud]

301
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:08,833
I think that was the
same sound I heard earlier.

302
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:10,583
It's an evil window ghost!

303
00:17:10,666 --> 00:17:12,416
Oh, yeah?

304
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,541
[shrieks]

305
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,500
It's open a little.

306
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:20,041
Well that explains
why it's so cold.

307
00:17:20,125 --> 00:17:22,666
Hey Chi, would you mind
closing the window for me?

308
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,500
Huh?

309
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,166
You scared? Uuh!

310
00:17:30,250 --> 00:17:31,958
Now go to sleep!

311
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:33,833
[MADOKA]
'Kay.

312
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:42,041
[CHIYO laughs]

313
00:17:44,208 --> 00:17:46,000
[CHIYO laughs]

314
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,916
[screams]
Window Ghost!

315
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:52,625
Sh! Be quiet, or you'll
wake him up, scaredy-cat!

316
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,916
[CHIHIRO]
It's that girl

317
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,583
[CHIYO] After I went through
all that trouble to help,

318
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:00,416
you're calling me
an evil window ghost?

319
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:02,125
That's quite rude!

320
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,583
It's been one year exactly now.

321
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:06,166
That's why I came to visit.

322
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,416
[CHIHIRO]
One year?

323
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:09,833
[CHIYO] Let's have
a chat. That okay?

324
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:11,125
[CHIHIRO]
Huh?

325
00:18:11,208 --> 00:18:12,583
Just tell me anything.

326
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:15,750
Like what's happened
in the past year?

327
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:18,291
[CHIHIRO] Even though
I don't know who she is,

328
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,625
I feel like I know her.

329
00:18:21,708 --> 00:18:25,333
Okay. I ran into Madoka
and he brought me here.

330
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,083
[CHIYO]
Yeah?

331
00:18:27,166 --> 00:18:28,875
That's when
I met Keiichiro,

332
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,458
oh and Miyako
ran away from home.

333
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,750
I learned things...

334
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:37,291
...like how to
make rolled omelets.

335
00:18:37,375 --> 00:18:39,708
I found the cutest
little dog,

336
00:18:39,791 --> 00:18:42,208
Miyako and I made
pudding together,

337
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,333
I watched a scary movie
with my friends.

338
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:48,250
I met all the members
from the Uchoten Boys Band.

339
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:50,958
Oh, we threw a birthday
party for Madoka!

340
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:53,291
And then he came to
my open house at school.

341
00:18:53,375 --> 00:18:57,000
I read an essay that I wrote
called "My Future Dream."

342
00:18:57,083 --> 00:18:58,791
My friends helped
me clean on Christmas,

343
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,416
and then I learned
to skate! Kinda.

344
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,166
We watched the first sunrise.

345
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:07,041
I made some macarons
for all of Hino's family.

346
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:09,291
But then his sister, Hana,
ran away from home

347
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,375
and I helped take care of her.

348
00:19:11,458 --> 00:19:13,000
Madoka and I made botamochi

349
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:16,250
and cleaned Mom's
grave together.

350
00:19:16,333 --> 00:19:19,708
And then...

351
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:22,291
...I met...

352
00:19:22,375 --> 00:19:25,375
I met my grandmother,
Madoka's mom.

353
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,583
[CHIHIRO] In the spring, we had
a huge flower viewing party

354
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:35,208
and I started sixth grade!

355
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:36,708
So much has
happened this year,

356
00:19:36,791 --> 00:19:38,208
and it wasn't always easy

357
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:43,125
but still not once
did I ever feel alone!

358
00:19:45,458 --> 00:19:48,375
I see; that makes me glad.

359
00:19:51,916 --> 00:19:54,375
I'm glad you're happy, Chihiro.

360
00:19:54,458 --> 00:19:56,041
[CHIHIRO gasps]

361
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,791
Oh. I guess
it's time to go!

362
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,333
[CHIYO] Hey you!
Be good or else!

363
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:07,375
Uh.

364
00:20:21,875 --> 00:20:23,541
[CHIHIRO]
Mom.

365
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:27,583
[CHIYO]
Chihiro. See you later.

366
00:20:27,666 --> 00:20:30,500
Mom, wait!

367
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:48,500
[MADOKA moans]

368
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,000
[MADOKA]
Ouchie...

369
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,333
Chi, did you flick a sick guy
while he was sleeping?

370
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,375
Hey look, my fever's gone!

371
00:21:01,458 --> 00:21:02,791
[chuckles]

372
00:21:02,875 --> 00:21:06,250
Well you can thank my mom
for both of those things!

373
00:21:13,416 --> 00:21:15,833
[CHIHIRO]
Yep. Looks great!

374
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,250
Ah! Yay!

375
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:20,958
Yes! Take this!
And this! Ha!

376
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,541
Amahara, I thought you said
you were good at games?

377
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,375
[NAKAJIMA] Yeah,
Hino's crushing you!

378
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,125
[CHIYO] Remember that life
usually works out

379
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:28,791
okay in the end,
so you don't have to

380
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:30,041
stress about it too much.

381
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,250
[KEIICHIRO] ...finished
in time for delivery.

382
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:32,708
What should I do?

383
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,541
[HANAKO] And go!
Sparkle Starbeam!

384
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:36,875
Magical girl. True power!

385
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:40,375
Muahahahaha!
You'll never defeat me!

386
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,125
[HANAKO]
Eat my justice!

387
00:21:42,208 --> 00:21:45,541
Oh no! Justice tastes
terrible! I'm dead.

388
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:46,916
[HANAKO]
I win again!

389
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:48,333
[MADOKA chuckles]

390
00:21:48,416 --> 00:21:50,458
[CHIHIRO] Madoka! While you're
up here slacking off,

391
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:52,333
Keiichiro is turning gray!

392
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,791
You haven't grown up
at all this year, have you?

393
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,541
Time to shape up,
mister! Listen!

394
00:21:57,625 --> 00:22:00,291
Those who do not work,
shall not eat!

395
00:22:00,375 --> 00:22:03,041
[MADOKA] You're so mean.
I just got over being sick

396
00:22:03,125 --> 00:22:04,583
and you're picking on me!

397
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:05,916
[CHIHIRO]
Stop whining!

398
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,958
I watched you playing with Hana,
and you were fine!

399
00:22:08,041 --> 00:22:10,625
Don't make excuses!
Get to work or no dinner!

400
00:22:10,708 --> 00:22:13,625
Wah, Keiichiro,
Chi's being mean to me!

401
00:22:13,708 --> 00:22:15,708
[CHIHIRO]
Oh, I'll show you mean!
