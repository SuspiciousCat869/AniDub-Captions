00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:14,333
[KEIICHIRO]
Chihiro?

2
00:00:14,416 --> 00:00:15,500
I'm sorry to interrupt,

3
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:16,916
but would you mind
bringing the tea?

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,791
Sure!

5
00:00:22,166 --> 00:00:24,791
Oh, are you doing homework?

6
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,833
In that case,
I'll serve the tea.

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:29,416
It's no big deal.
I just finished up.

8
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:31,916
--How does Assam sound?
--[KEIICHIRO] Great.

9
00:00:32,875 --> 00:00:34,750
This counter isn't
exactly an ideal place

10
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:35,916
to do homework.

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,875
No, but I usually
don't bring any home

12
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:39,875
'cause I finish it
at school during breaks;

13
00:00:39,958 --> 00:00:41,916
which leaves plenty
of time to clean up here.

14
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,333
Is that a fact?

15
00:00:44,416 --> 00:00:46,333
[MADOKA] So it bothers you
that he won't study at home?

16
00:00:46,416 --> 00:00:47,833
He'd rather work hard
at school so he can

17
00:00:47,916 --> 00:00:50,208
start cleaning
as soon as possible.

18
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:52,708
He should be a good student
first and a maid second.

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,291
The very least we
could do is give him

20
00:00:54,375 --> 00:00:56,000
a desk for his room.

21
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:57,416
[MADOKA]
Under normal circumstances

22
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,416
I would agree with you, but...

23
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,250
...what can I say
when his grades are so high?

24
00:01:03,333 --> 00:01:04,875
Oh.

25
00:01:04,958 --> 00:01:07,500
He's excelling in every subject
like some kind of prodigy.

26
00:01:07,583 --> 00:01:09,666
There's no denying
he's an excellent student.

27
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,250
Do you think he might act
like too much of an adult?

28
00:01:12,333 --> 00:01:14,291
I can't stand the thought
of him sweeping the floors

29
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,666
while his childhood passes by.

30
00:01:16,750 --> 00:01:18,458
But Chihiro
loves this so much,

31
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,250
I couldn't take it away.

32
00:01:20,333 --> 00:01:22,458
[CHIHIRO hums]

33
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:24,250
Ha!

34
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,416
[laughs]

35
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:27,666
I'm not sure if
there's anything

36
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,333
we can do for him at this point.

37
00:01:29,416 --> 00:01:31,041
I think you're right.

38
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:05,208
[CHIHIRO, TAKEI]
Bring it on!

39
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,916
Look, 98 percent!

40
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,625
One hundred!

41
00:03:08,708 --> 00:03:10,458
Aw. I lost.

42
00:03:10,541 --> 00:03:14,250
[chuckles] I felt pretty good
about my answers this time.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,916
I don't get it.
Explain to me how you guys

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,208
can get such good scores
without studying.

45
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:22,125
I study! In the classroom!

46
00:03:22,208 --> 00:03:23,458
You're kidding me.

47
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,083
All right, class.
Please quiet down.

48
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:30,541
Next week we're hosting
our yearly open house.

49
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,416
I hope you'll all remember
to pass this note on

50
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:35,083
to your parent
or guardian.

51
00:03:35,166 --> 00:03:37,208
That means you, Komiya.

52
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,458
Me?

53
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:39,916
[SAKAMOTO] A little bird
told me that your note

54
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,625
didn't make it home last year.

55
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:43,208
Let's not have
a repeat of that.

56
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,875
[STUDENTS laugh]

57
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,416
Pay attention.
Here is your homework.

58
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:49,375
Get your gears turning
and write an essay

59
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,458
to read aloud
at the open house.

60
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:53,750
Your topic is...

61
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,291
[CHIHIRO]
Our future dreams?

62
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:00,875
I expect you to
write about what job

63
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,583
you'd like to have
when you're older,

64
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:06,500
including your reasons
for picking that job.

65
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,208
So what's my dream?

66
00:04:08,291 --> 00:04:10,750
[AMAHARA] Essays are like the
worst thing on the planet.

67
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,375
Yeah, to be honest
I feel like the topic

68
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:14,166
is a little
too complicated.

69
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,625
Really? I figured you'd
be good at writing essays.

70
00:04:16,708 --> 00:04:17,958
Well, it's just
that I have no idea

71
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,750
what I want to be
when I grow up.

72
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,583
It's not like you've
never thought about it.

73
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,583
There's gotta be something
you'd like to be.

74
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,625
I did have this idea once.

75
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,625
[PRESCHOOL TEACHER 7A] Can you
tell us what you'd like

76
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:30,000
to be when you're
all grown up, Chihiro?

77
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:31,000
[PRESCHOOL TEACHER 7B]
You like books,

78
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,666
so maybe you'll be a teacher?

79
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,250
No. I wanna be rich!

80
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,375
Well, you can't really
fault the kid for having goals.

81
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,750
Try to think big!

82
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,000
You could be a soccer player,
a prime minister,

83
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,916
or even a voice actor in the
greatest anime of all time!

84
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,083
Could we try
to be realistic here?

85
00:04:50,166 --> 00:04:51,333
I think you
should pick a job

86
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,208
that fits your personality.

87
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,166
That would be
a good place to start.

88
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,916
A dream for the future
that will fit my personality.

89
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:05,166

See ya!

90
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,333

[CHIHIRO]
Later!

92
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,083
[HINO]
So, what have you decided?

93
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:12,375
[CHIHIRO]
About what?

94
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:14,166
[HINO]
The open house next week.

95
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,625
Are you gonna tell
Madoka about it?

96
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,083
[CHIHIRO]
I haven't figured it out.

97
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:19,083
To be honest, he's pretty
busy most of the time,

98
00:05:19,166 --> 00:05:21,083
plus he doesn't
like crowds all that much.

99
00:05:21,166 --> 00:05:22,833
He might not like it.

100
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:28,083
[CHIHIRO] I mean, it's not like
he's my parent or anything.

101
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,416
Komiya.

102
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:33,583
I just remembered
that I still have to

103
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,333
go grocery shopping! See ya!

104
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:39,833
Hey, will you
wait a minute?

105
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,375
He's gonna have some kind
of breakdown one day.

106
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:47,625
[phone beeps]

107
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,291
There's an open house soon.

108
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,666
At Chihiro's school?

109
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,625
Yes. Got a text from Hino.

110
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,416
Just wanted to let you know
that next Monday

111
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,875
we're having an open house.

112
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:59,333
We all hafta present essays
about our "future dreams."

113
00:05:59,416 --> 00:06:01,416
Komiya seemed a bit nervous
about telling you,

114
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:04,541
so you should probably go ahead
and ask him about it.

115
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:07,625
He says it's
this coming Monday.

116
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:09,416
That should be fine.

117
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,333
You don't have
anything scheduled.

118
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,250
[MADOKA] I wonder if
he even wants me to go.

119
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,666
I can't force him.

120
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,916
Maybe he doesn't want me
to know it's happening.

121
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,833
[KEIICHIRO] There should be
no harm in asking him.

122
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,916
Honestly, I don't know
if my heart could stand it

123
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,916
if he doesn't
want me to be there.

124
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,416
[sighs]

125
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:29,500
What's your problem,
Keiichiro?

126
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,541
[KEIICHIRO] Nothing.
It's almost time for me

127
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,125
to head home for the evening.

128
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:34,583
If you could do one thing,

129
00:06:34,666 --> 00:06:37,000
please act like
a sane adult around him.

130
00:06:37,083 --> 00:06:38,916
Hm!

131
00:06:41,875 --> 00:06:44,625
[MADOKA]
I have feelings, you know!

132
00:06:54,583 --> 00:06:56,375
[BOTH]
I wanted--

133
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:57,708
Go ahead.

134
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,125
I wanted to ask
how school went today.

135
00:07:00,208 --> 00:07:02,916
I made a one hundred
on the social studies test.

136
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,791
That's great to hear!
Anything else?

137
00:07:05,875 --> 00:07:08,625
Nah, not really.

138
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:11,916
My day was dull.
Nothing to report.

139
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,125
[CHIHIRO]
Madoka.

140
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:21,666
Uh. Yes, Chi?

141
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,916
Look down.
There's food on you.

142
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,041
Aah.

143
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,625
[CHIHIRO]
Just give it up already.

144
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:33,250
Madoka really doesn't
like going outside.

145
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:35,458
And it isn't exactly
a matter of life and death

146
00:07:35,541 --> 00:07:37,791
whether he comes
to the open house or not.

147
00:07:37,875 --> 00:07:39,958
It'll be a live-in position
with three meals a day

148
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,375
plus snacks
and cover school fees!

149
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,416
Sound good?
What do you think?

150
00:07:45,291 --> 00:07:46,833
I guess I still feel
kind of guilty about

151
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,750
how much he's already
done for me.

152
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:51,416
I don't want him to feel
pressured to do anything

153
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,958
he doesn't want to do.

154
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:56,041
Hey, Chi?

155
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,375
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah? What's up?

156
00:07:57,458 --> 00:07:59,708
Just got out. The bath's
free if you want it.

157
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:02,541
Sure! I'll do that now.

00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:25,250
Seems there's an
open house I'm invited to?

161
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:26,958
It's nothing much.

162
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,666
[yells]

163
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,208
Did you really think you
could hide something

164
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:31,541
like this from your mother?

165
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,666
[CHIHIRO] I was trying
to do the right thing!

166
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:37,458
[sighs]

167
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:39,500
Why didn't you want me
to know about it?

168
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:42,208
I'm sorry. I thought
you were too busy.

169
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,916
I can always
take time off work

170
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
for important
events like this.

171
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:48,750
Please don't
keep things from me.

172
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:53,500
Sweetheart. I'll always do
my best to be there for you.

173
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,666
[MADOKA] There's no need
to hide things.

174
00:08:56,750 --> 00:09:00,375
Did you really think
I wouldn't consider the idea?

175
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,166
[door clicks]

176
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,833
Hey there.
What about your bath?

177
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,833
This is for you.

178
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:22,208
We're having
an open house next week.

179
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,333
It's not that big of
a deal if you can't come.

180
00:09:24,416 --> 00:09:26,458
There are gonna be
a lot of people.

181
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,666
So, yeah, anyway,
I promise I'm not gonna

182
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:33,125
be upset if you aren't able
to go to this thing, but...

183
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,333
...would you like to?

184
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:39,833
Madoka?

185
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:41,541
Eh!

186
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,125
I'll definitely go!

187
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,000
You're sure you're not
too busy with work?

188
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,833
[MADOKA]
Work's no problem!

189
00:09:47,916 --> 00:09:49,750
I'll have Keiichiro
take care of everything!

190
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,583
You're making him do it all?

191
00:09:51,666 --> 00:09:52,875
Now that all this
is cleared up,

192
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,583
I think I'm going
to make a new suit!

193
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,333
What kind of look
do I want for this?

194
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,708
Is violet a bright enough
color to wear?

195
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,208
I wonder. Maybe some
lamé this time.

196
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,833
There's no reason
to do anything like that!

197
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:05,166
I want you to be proud
to have me at the open house!

198
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:07,166
I'm more than willing to
go the extra mile for you!

199
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,500
[CHIHIRO] Just dress like
you normally would!

200
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,333
[MADOKA] But this is
a special occasion!

201
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,875
I'll have to take
the entire silhouette

202
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,583
into consideration.
Maybe lace trimming?

203
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:18,750
[CHIHIRO] Wow, I guess I didn't
have a reason to be nervous.

204
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:21,041
I'm glad I told him.

205
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,541
Honestly, I'm just
thrilled you invited me!

206
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,708
You have to present an essay,
isn't that right?

207
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:26,916
So, have you managed
to figure out

208
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,291
your future dream yet?

209
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:31,166
How do you know
about the essay?

210
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,833
Uh.

211
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,166
[CHIHIRO] The note never
mentioned anything about

212
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:36,208
us presenting our essays,
so you better tell me

213
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,666
right now how
you found out about it!

214
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:41,958
Didn't you tell me?
I forget. I, uh.

215
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:43,625
Sure it wasn't in the note?

216
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,916
[CHIHIRO] Stop goofing
around and confess!

217
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,291
[MADOKA] What do you want
to be when you grow up?

218
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,000
Anything you come up
with should work.

219
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,375
It's not that big of a deal.

220
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,583
That's easy to say
when you're not

221
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,166
the one presenting it!

222
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:58,083
I wanted to grow up
to be Francis Xavier.

223
00:10:58,166 --> 00:11:00,291
What? The missionary?

224
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,208
[XAVIER]
Xavier.

225
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,750
[MADOKA] I figured he was
some fashion guru

226
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,125
with that Elizabethan collar.

227
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,333
Please don't
tell me that the frills

228
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,958
were all you cared about!

229
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,791
[MADOKA] Then one day Keiichiro
brought me information

230
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,583
about joining mission schools.

231
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,250
Do you know which seminary
you'd like to attend?

232
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,416
[MADOKA]
Uh...

233
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:16,625
I might have been a priest.

234
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:18,708
It's sort of crazy
to think about now.

235
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,791
I can't see that happening.

236
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,375
Let's brainstorm a little.

237
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,125
Can you think of anything
you'd like to achieve?

238
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,000
That's a good place to start.

239
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:29,166
Hmmm. Well, I think being
able to clean up after you

240
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,625
is an achievement.

241
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,750
But I've been working hard
to keep my stuff organized!

242
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,583
Piling all of the junk
you don't wanna deal with

243
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,166
in one box isn't organizing!

244
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,916
I don't mean
picking up after us.

245
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,625
When you were little, what
was something you wanted

246
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,125
more than anything else?
Remember?

247
00:11:43,208 --> 00:11:44,791
[CHIHIRO]
Hmmm.

248
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,750
[CHIHIRO]
When I was little...

249
00:11:47,916 --> 00:11:50,208
[CHIHIRO] After they were
reunited, the princess lived

250
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,958
happily ever after
with the king and queen.

251
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:55,041
From then on, there was
joy and celebration

252
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:56,666
throughout the land.

253
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,958
No one was ever sad again.

254
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:01,833
[CHIHIRO] I liked
the idea of being rich.

255
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:03,250
[MADOKA]
Hey, Chi.

256
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,208
I thought money
could solve it all.

257
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,416
I wanted to be wealthy so Mom
wouldn't have to work as hard.

258
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,041
But that probably
isn't something

259
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:11,750
I should put in my essay.

260
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,000
[MADOKA]
How rich?

261
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,583
How rich? What kind of
wealth are we talking here?

262
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:18,250
You mean like mogul-type money?

263
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,333
Uh, maybe?
Is that a lot?

264
00:12:20,416 --> 00:12:21,833
Running a conglomerate
takes a special

265
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,458
type of person, but

266
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:25,208
you're extremely
responsible and organized,

267
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:26,750
so you would be perfect.

268
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,375
You don't think
that's an immature goal?

269
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:29,958
Not at all.
I don't believe that

270
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:31,625
you should ever
be embarrassed about

271
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,583
wanting to make life
easier for your family.

272
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:35,458
Plus, it's a lot
of fun earning money!

273
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,083
Are you serious?

274
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:40,000
Mhm. I remember when
I was first paid for my work.

275
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:43,750
Even though it wasn't a lot,
it was still very satisfying.

276
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:47,000
Hooray!

277
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,750
We just need to figure out

278
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,833
what kind of business
you'd like to start.

279
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,708
I think the best idea
is to stick to something

280
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:55,958
you're good at.

281
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,000
'Kay, like what?

282
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,958
[BOTH]
Hey, I know! Cleaning!

283
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,250
Then... I should be
a housekeeper?

284
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,625
[MADOKA] There's no denying
you're good enough

285
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,333
to get paid for doing chores,

286
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:07,583
but let's think
more along the lines

287
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,916
of making a business out of it.

288
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,958
I could oversee
a team of window washers,

289
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:16,875
or be a server
at some fancy inn.

290
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,208
What about running
your own hotel?

291
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:23,416
[MADOKA] Hotel tycoons are some
of the richest people around!

292
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,125
The hallways
are lined with rooms,

293
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:27,250
so you could clean
as much as you want!

294
00:13:27,333 --> 00:13:29,458
I could clean
as much as I want?

295
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,708
I think me living in a
penthouse on the top floor

296
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:33,000
is another great idea!

297
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:34,666
Hold on, live in a hotel?

298
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,875
[MADOKA]
Mhm.

299
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:37,958
My essay paper isn't
a sketchbook you know!

300
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,416
[MADOKA]
Reservation for one!

301
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,833
[CHIHIRO]
Stop drawing!

302
00:13:40,916 --> 00:13:42,166
I can make all of
the employee uniforms

303
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,458
coordinate with yours!

304
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:44,791
We can start designing now!

305
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,625
Would you get your own
paper to write on?

306
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,708
[MADOKA]
Here. Do you like it?

307
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:50,833
Seriously? You'd be
unstoppable if you were

308
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:53,333
this fast on your own projects.

309
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:56,125
There's also the matter
of deciding what food to offer.

310
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:57,916
So much to choose from!

311
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,875
Might I suggest an
international gourmet menu?

312
00:14:00,958 --> 00:14:02,583
[CHIHIRO] Weird.
I've never talked to anyone

313
00:14:02,666 --> 00:14:04,500
about this stuff.

314
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:06,666
It's fun. I guess
I never let myself

315
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:10,708
think about my future.
I could do anything!

something like this?

I can't believe
so many people showed up

323
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,041
on a Monday afternoon!

324
00:14:41,125 --> 00:14:42,791
It's a little weird
how excited they are

325
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:45,041
to see where their kids are
stuck learning every day.

326

I figured your family
would have come today, Hino!

Are you kidding me?
We wouldn't wanna miss this!

We were all so excited
to come to your open house!

An event like this
has gotta be a family affair!

00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,791
Yeah, we had to
check in to make sure

335
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:09,125
you aren't causing too much
trouble for the teacher!

I can't believe
everybody came

[CHIHIRO]
Madoka isn't here.

351
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:48,000
I wonder if he ended up
working after all,

352
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:51,166
or maybe he got a stomachache
before he even left the house.

Hi, Chihiro!

He looks nice.
Who's dad is that?

365
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:20,041
[MATSUKI] Well he
just said "Chihiro"!

So that's Komiya's dad?

I bet he's a model.

370

I'm glad he's here, but
he seems so out of place.

371

I didn't know you
were coming, Keiichiro.

372

Sorry I didn't ask first.

373

He seemed confident
on the drive over,

374
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,208
but I thought it might be
best if I came in with him.

375
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:43,000
Hopeless. He's going
to embarrass himself.

[NOMURA] "My Future Dream"
by Yu Nomura.

380
00:16:56,500 --> 00:17:00,166
After high school and college
I want to be a homemaker.

381
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:03,166
Recently, women have
taken on essential roles

382
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:06,458
and leadership responsibilities
outside of the home.

383
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,791
However, I believe that
managing a household

384
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,833
can be a very
rewarding job as well.

385
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:13,250
[CHIHIRO] I wonder if
Madoka's feeling okay.

386
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,875

393

all that well, but I'm
so glad he came!

394

Great! Thank you
for sharing, Nomura.

At first I wasn't sure
what I wanted to be

400
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:51,416
when I grew up,
so I got a little help.

401
00:17:51,500 --> 00:17:53,750
I decided that I'd like
to be a hotel tycoon,

402
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:55,875
because it would let me do
a lot of things I'm good at.

403
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,125
Organization, for instance,
comes easily to me.

404
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,458
I also like to
keep things clean.

405

[MADOKA] Okay then! Are you
allowed to go home?

[CHIHIRO]
Yep!

407
00:18:06,125 --> 00:18:07,750
Great! Then let's
head to the car.

408

Yes, ma'am?

Your essay was great.
Very impressive.

411
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:17,125
I must admit, a hotel tycoon
wasn't what I expected!

412
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:19,791
Yeah. I was a little
surprised myself.

413
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,041
It's nice to meet you.

414
00:18:21,125 --> 00:18:23,291
I'm Chihiro's teacher,
Ms. Sakamoto.

415
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:24,833
It's a real pleasure.

416
00:18:24,916 --> 00:18:26,416
I was wondering
if you could possibly

417
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,833
spare a moment of your time.

418
00:18:28,916 --> 00:18:30,333
I wanted to speak
to you about some of

419
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:32,791
the recent changes that have
happened for Chihiro.

420
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,333
I'm sure it's been
hard at times,

421
00:18:34,416 --> 00:18:36,916
but what can you tell me about
your home life right now?

422
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,583
[BOTH] You want us to tell
you what we're like at home?

423
00:18:39,666 --> 00:18:42,666
[CHIHIRO] If you take
it out, put it away!

424
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:45,625
Well, I'll just be going, then.

425
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:48,791
What do you want with me?

426
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,125
Don't leave! We need you!

427
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:51,541
You know I can't
depend on Madoka

428
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,583
to make us look normal
in front of my teacher!

429
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,083
I suppose you wouldn't need
me for very long, right?

430
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:57,875
Right! Just a teeny bit of time

431
00:18:57,958 --> 00:18:59,041
that'll be over
before you know it.

432
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,250
It'll be easy!

433
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:01,541
[BOTH]
Okay?

434
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:03,291
No. I'm not
speaking for you.

435
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:04,500
You've taken on
the responsibility

436
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:05,916
of being his guardian.

437
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,208
Participating in meetings
makes you look capable!

438
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:09,708
[SAKAMOTO]
Hm?

439
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,625
And as Madoka's guardian,
it's your obligation

440
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,625
to make sure he doesn't
say something stupid!

441
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:16,000
Believe me, I've been trying
to do that for years.

442
00:19:16,083 --> 00:19:19,000
Though I appreciate the offer,
I must politely decline.

443
00:19:20,416 --> 00:19:22,583
Good luck.

444
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:28,791
So! Will the two of you
please come this way?

445
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,666
[SAKAMOTO] All right then,
Mr. Takatori,

446
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,291
if you don't mind,
can you tell me

447
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:37,625
how Chihiro
spends his time at home?

448

Of course I don't mind.

[CHIHIRO] Don't say too much.
Don't say too much.

450

Don't say too much.
Don't say too much.

451
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,166
He stays busy.

452
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,666
What do you mean by that?

453
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,000
Does he help with the housework
at all, for example?

454
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:50,708
Yes! He's a huge help!

455
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:53,166
And not only that,
he does all of the cook--

[wails]

457

Yes. Was there
something you needed?

458
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,791
You shouldn't
tell her that stuff.

459
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:00,458
[MADOKA] What's the matter
with telling her the truth?

Be quiet!

00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,291
Yeah, but you're making us
look like we're all messed up!

471
00:20:19,375 --> 00:20:21,250
[MADOKA] We never rehearsed
this, so how would I know

472
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:22,250
what you want me to say?

473
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:23,458
[CHIHIRO]
You know how to talk,

474
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:24,875
so just say the stuff
grown-ups like!

475
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:26,375
[MADOKA] Do you realize how much
sense that doesn't make?

476
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:27,833
[CHIHIRO] Don't tell her that
I clean and cook so much!

477
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:30,208
I mean, I enjoy it, but that
makes us look super weird!

478
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:31,666
[MADOKA] Well maybe
you should take the lead!

479
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,208
You're supposed
to be the adult here!

480
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,375
Can't you see I'm trying
my best here?

481
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:38,750
[SAKAMOTO] I'm glad.
They really get along well.

482
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,125
I don't have to worry.

483
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:44,458
[CHIHIRO]
I can't believe you!

484
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,958
You have no idea
how much trouble

485
00:20:46,041 --> 00:20:47,416
you could have gotten us into!

486
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,791
I was honest. You're
a huge help around here.

487
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,166
Why is that bad?

488
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:52,916
People might get
the wrong idea if they hear

489
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:55,208
that an elementary schooler is
taking care of the housework

490
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,333
and cooking all of
your meals for you!

491
00:20:57,416 --> 00:21:00,333
But you really
are doing all that.

492
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,083
You're totally
missing the point here!

493
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:03,708
[MADOKA] Calm down
before you hit me!

494
00:21:03,791 --> 00:21:06,083
[KEIICHIRO] Chihiro.
Your essay touched my heart.

495
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:08,500
You did a wonderful job.

496
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:10,208
I had no idea
that you were interested

497
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:11,875
in business administration!

498
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:13,291
[CHIHIRO] What's with
all the books?

499
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,250
A Beginner's Guide
to Management!

500
00:21:17,333 --> 00:21:19,291
Strategy Guide
to Acquiring an MBA!

501
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:21,041
Management Basics
and Applications!

502
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:23,125
Stock Portfolios Made Easy!

503
00:21:23,208 --> 00:21:25,208
I've got a lot more
if you need them!

504
00:21:25,291 --> 00:21:26,916
Since it's your goal
to be a proprietor,

505
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,708
it may be in your best interest
to start working on your degree.

506
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,375
But before that,
have you considering

507
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,958
a study abroad program?

508
00:21:33,041 --> 00:21:34,791
Keiichiro, please,
calm down.

509
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:36,625
Hey. Do I read all of these?

510
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,541
No matter what dream
you decide to chase,

511
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,458
I'm certain you'll have to work
hard to make it come true!

512
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:43,291
But you'll be fine.

513
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:45,875
Do you believe that,
or are you being polite?

514
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,250
[MADOKA]
Both! I have faith in you!

515
00:21:48,333 --> 00:21:50,083
If you want proof,
I've recently put

516
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,583
an early investment
in your bedroom.

517
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:53,791
[CHIHIRO]
What is it?

518
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,500
[MADOKA]
Oh. You'll see!

519
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:09,250
Wait a second.

520
00:22:09,333 --> 00:22:10,833
Now that I think about it,

521
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:13,708
who was that man
in the glasses?

522
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:52,708
[AMAHARA] Did you guys
have fun at the open house?

523
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,000
[TAKEI]
Yeah!

524
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:55,583
[AMAHARA] I'm glad
I finally met Hino's family.

525
00:23:55,666 --> 00:23:57,583
[TAKEI] His big sister sure
was pretty, wasn't she?

526
00:23:57,666 --> 00:23:58,708
[HINO]
Don't make me laugh.

527
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,125
What's so pretty about her?

528
00:24:00,208 --> 00:24:02,000
[AMAHARA] She's a babe!
Wait a sec, Hino.

529
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:04,291
Is that her standing
behind you? She looks angry!

530
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:05,458
[HINO]
I was just fooling around!

531
00:24:05,541 --> 00:24:07,541
My sister is as kind
as she is beautiful.

532
00:24:07,625 --> 00:24:09,250
And smart! And perfect
in every way!

533
00:24:09,333 --> 00:24:10,833
[AMAHARA]
Oh. Now she's nodding.

534
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:12,250
[TAKEI]
She's smiling too.

535
00:24:12,333 --> 00:24:13,708
[HINO]
Good. Then I'm safe.

536
00:24:13,791 --> 00:24:15,833
We're calling the next episode
"Sisters Scuffle"!

537
00:24:15,916 --> 00:24:19,125
I mean, "The Devil Scoffs When
You Talk of Next Year."

538
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,125
[AMAHARA]
Please watch!
