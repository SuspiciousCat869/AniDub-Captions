Despite the daily stresses,
he still works valiantly

00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:20,291
to keep things clean and orderly
in the Takatori household.

[CHIHIRO] You're not gonna help?
I'm the maid around here.

8

I'm trying hard
just like my mother said

00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:27,500
in the letter she left for me.

10
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:28,625
[CHIHIRO]
Her exact words were:

11
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:31,041
"Those who do not work
shall not eat!"

12
00:00:31,125 --> 00:00:32,750
[MADOKA] I think you're
doing a great job!

Well, I think you should

Where have I seen this before?

Oh, my.

23
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:36,458
Sorry! He runs off sometimes.

24

My goodness.
People should be

25
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:39,833
more careful when
they walk their pets.

26
00:02:39,916 --> 00:02:41,541
That thing could have
bitten someone.

27
00:02:41,625 --> 00:02:43,916
Yeah, but he
was pretty small.

Beware of furry demons!

29
00:02:46,208 --> 00:02:49,166
[CHIHIRO] I guess people who
hate dogs all act the same way.

00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:52,000
Oh dear. Looks like I've
embarrassed myself

31
00:02:52,083 --> 00:02:53,833
in front of you again,
haven't I?

32
00:02:53,916 --> 00:02:55,291
[CHIHIRO]
It's okay.

33
00:02:55,375 --> 00:02:57,666
I think your name
is Chihiro, right?

34
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,041
That's twice that
you've saved my life.

35
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:01,666
Would it be all right
if I treat you

36
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,500
to a cup of tea
as a thank you?

37
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,708
What? There's really
no need for that!

[KAZUSA]
Oh, too bad.

39
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:11,166
But I suppose it's not hip to
drink tea with an old woman.

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:13,333
[CHIHIRO] Sorry!
That's not what I meant!

I'm only joking.

I know. How about tomorrow?

I don't go to school
tomorrow so...

with this stuff?

It's all my

Oh. Is that so?

would say about that.

As soon as she
found me I went ahead

and told her family that
we'd take care of her!

that you'd take care of her.

00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,791
No, I do not!

162
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:39,083
[MADOKA]
I'm so glad you're awake!

163
00:08:39,166 --> 00:08:41,250
Would you like me
to make you a dress?

164
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,458
Yes, please!

165
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,125
What kind would you like?

166
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,833
A frilly one!
For a princess!

167
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,250
We had so much fun!

168
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:57,416
I could probably
sew dresses 24/7

169
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,833
with that young lady!
She's got style!

170
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:01,083
Aren't there
a few projects

171
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:02,666
you should be finishing?

172
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:06,250
How strange. You sound
just like Keiichiro.

173
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,583
[CHIHIRO] Just great. I really
wanted to talk to her

174
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,291
before she went
to sleep tonight.

175
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,625
Talk to her?

176
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,291
For Hino. I want to
help them to stop fighting.

177
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,291
I don't think you
should worry yourself.

178
00:09:16,375 --> 00:09:18,208
People only bicker
with those they love.

179
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,750
Huh? Then why did you
keep her for the night?

180
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:22,083
Well to be honest,

181
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,750
she went to so much
trouble running away,

182
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:25,416
I would feel bad
sending her back.

183
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,666
For real?
She lives there.

184
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,041
Well, Miyako
ran away from home

185
00:09:29,125 --> 00:09:30,708
when she was
about that age, too.

186
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,833
[CHIHIRO]
Huh?

187
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,583
I hate you so much, Father!

188
00:09:33,666 --> 00:09:35,750
Shocked!

189
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,250
[MIYAKO sobbing]

190
00:09:37,333 --> 00:09:39,583
[MADOKA] I lived so far away she
had to come with a driver.

191
00:09:39,666 --> 00:09:41,125
[chuckles]

192
00:09:41,208 --> 00:09:43,416
He resisted at first so she
tried walking here on her own.

193
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:44,916
The man felt so guilty about it

194
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,208
that he gave in
and brought her anyway.

195
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:51,250
But Miyako was so cute
and little I had to help.

196
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:54,250
And if I remember right, sis
would side with Uncle Otori.

197
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,791
Why'd she do that?

198
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,916
[MADOKA] She thought it would
only be fair if both of them

199
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,500
had someone to defend
their point of view.

200
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,875
Your father's come all
this way to take you home.

201
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,250
Are you ready to go now?

202
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,458
No! I'm never going back!

203
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:09,083
Super shocked!

204
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,833
Hm! Poor Hino.
Did you see him?

205
00:10:11,916 --> 00:10:14,291
He looked so disappointed
walking home.

206
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:16,000
It reminded me
of Miyako's father

207
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:19,166
when he went home that evening!
[chuckles]

208
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,958
You shouldn't laugh.

209
00:10:22,125 --> 00:10:23,833
[CHIHIRO]
I can't believe this.

210
00:10:23,916 --> 00:10:25,541
You'd think a kid
running away from home

211
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,333
would be taken more seriously.

212
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:29,458
[knock, knock]

213
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:37,500
[CHIHIRO] Hey there.
What's wrong? Can't sleep?

214
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:39,625
Are you okay?

215
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:43,625
[CHIHIRO]
Wanna sleep in here?

216
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,291
[HANAKO]
Mhmmm.

217
00:10:45,375 --> 00:10:48,000
[HANAKO] This is
a giant king's bed!

218
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:49,583
Like a fairy tale!

219
00:10:49,666 --> 00:10:52,625
Glad you like it.
Oh! Almost forgot.

220
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:54,500
Here you go.

221
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:58,458
Hino wanted me to
give this back to you.

222
00:10:58,541 --> 00:11:00,666
He's mad at me
for not coming home, huh?

223
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,750
He's pretty tough,
so I know he'll be fine.

224
00:11:02,833 --> 00:11:03,875
[HANAKO]
Really?

225
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:05,083
[CHIHIRO]
Mhm.

226
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,125
I mean,
aside from the crying.

227
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:09,583
I'm not crying!

228
00:11:09,666 --> 00:11:12,666
[HANAKO] Know what? It was
supposed to be a secret.

229
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:16,250
I promised Ayu I wouldn't show
anybody our special journal.

230
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,875
We pinky swore!

231
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:20,083
Yuji looked
and ruined everything.

232
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:23,416
[CHIHIRO] I don't think
he meant to hurt you.

233
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:26,291
[HANAKO]
But I said I hated him.

234
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:30,166
What if he's mad at me forever?
He'll leave me here.

235
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,791
What? That's ridiculous!
He would never leave you!

236
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,125
You think so?

237
00:11:35,208 --> 00:11:38,250
You bet! Don't worry.

238
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:41,291
Tomorrow you guys are
gonna make up for sure.

239
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,625
Right?

240
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,500
[HANAKO]
'Kay.

241
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,583
[MADOKA]
Ta-da!

242
00:11:56,666 --> 00:12:00,083
Look, she's a magical girl!

243
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:02,000
Mhm! Looks so cute!

244
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,708
Thanks to you,
Uncle Maddy!

245
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,208
[MADOKA, HANAKO]
Yay!

246
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:08,125
If only you could
get this enthusiastic

247
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,583
when it comes to getting
your actual work done.

248
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:13,541
[doorbell buzzes]

249
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,125
[door knob clicks]

250
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:17,291
--[HINO] Morning.
--[CHIHIRO] Nice to see you.

251
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,083
Hey Hana!
Your brother's here!

252
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:24,833
Why're you wearing
that weird dress?

253
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,458
[CHIHIRO, HINO]
Huh?

254
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,541
I figured she'd
be over it by now.

255
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,250
I don't think she was.
Let's go find her.

256
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,708
[MADOKA]
Surprise!

257
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:48,125
It's a real magic wand!

258
00:12:48,208 --> 00:12:50,625
If you ask me,
every magical girl needs one!

259
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:53,583
Now you can
make wishes come true!

260
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:56,958
Really?

261
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:59,458
It's full of magic.
Think hard;

262
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,250
what do you want
more than anything?

263
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,541
The wand will help you
make it a reality.

264
00:13:03,625 --> 00:13:07,041
It will? Anything?

265
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,791
[HANAKO]
I don't hate you.

266
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:27,875
Thanks, sis. Love ya.

267
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:30,041
[laughs]

268
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,958
See ya later!

269
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:36,291
[CHIHIRO]
Oooh. I'm exhausted.

270
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,625
[chuckles] She wasn't
that much work, was she?

271
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,458
All you did
was play with her!

272
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,541
She was really upset last night.

273
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:45,250
But still, I'm sure
you had no trouble

274
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:46,458
cheering her up.

275
00:13:46,541 --> 00:13:48,041
Huh?

276
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:49,500
I think she
really liked you!

277
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:50,833
There's a sort of
gentleness about you

278
00:13:50,916 --> 00:13:52,916
that people seem to be drawn to.

279
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,041
You'd be a great nanny!

280
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:58,000
Hey, it's not my fault
that you're so likable!

281
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,541
And then
I had desserts,

282
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:01,166
and they were yummy!

283
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,625
Wow! Pretty dress!

284
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,041
That's adorable!

285
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:05,875
We drew lots of pictures
and Uncle Maddy

286
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:07,583
made this special dress
just for me!

287
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:09,416
[HINO] I guess everybody
and their dog is gonna

288
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:12,708
stare at us the whole way home.
Why is she torturing me?

289
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:15,208
[HANAKO] ...make a wish
it can totally come true!

290
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,875
[KEIICHIRO moans]

291
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:26,083
So Keiichiro, you seem
a little quiet today.

292
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,083
[KEIICHIRO]
After all I said,

293
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,291
you didn't
do anything yesterday...

294
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,875
I'm sorry! I'll take
care of everything!

295
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,750
[CHIHIRO] I think I'll leave
them alone for this.

296
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,916
Both of us got
distracted yesterday.

297
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,750
[doorbell buzzes]

298
00:14:37,833 --> 00:14:39,375
[CHIHIRO]
I'm coming!

299
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:42,291
[UCHOTEN BOYS]
I'm not gonna say,

300
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,875
I shouldn't even have to say.

301
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,125
I got some time off
so I wanted

302
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,000
to pay you guys a visit!

303
00:14:48,083 --> 00:14:49,416
Don't you remember me?

304
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,958
I'm Ryuji from
the Uchoten Boys!

305
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,416
I'll aim my charm
straight at your heart.

306
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,375
[CHIHIRO] Of course
I remember who you are.

307
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,041
But why did you
bring so much stuff?

308
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,583
Oh! I didn't know what
I'd need for the sleepover!

309
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,750
The what?

310
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:03,208
[RYUJI]
I guess nobody told you.

311
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:04,916
Hino and I decided that
your house would be

312
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,666
the best place
to play video games!

313
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:08,833
That's news to me!

314
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,458
Sorry! The Hana thing
kinda took over

315
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,541
and I forgot to tell you.

316
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,333
I'll head over soon.
She's doing a lot better now.

317
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,708
And here you go!

318
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,083
I can feel your magic
working on me!

319
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,916
Magical Hana
saves the day!

320
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,416
[KOJI] Ha-ha-ha!
Rescue Mask is here at last!

321
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,000
Will you guys keep
it down, please? I'm busy!

322
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:29,666
Rescue Mask's
the good guy.

323
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,250
If you wanna be 'im, you gotta
be handsome and rich.

324
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:33,916
I quit.

325
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,458
[RYUJI] Hold up. Are you
going out or something?

326
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,458
Yeah. Hino will
be here soon anyway.

327

[yells]

328
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:41,958
[CHIHIRO] Madoka's got
a deadline coming up,

329
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:43,416
so don't bother him.

330
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,875
There are snacks
for you in the kitchen,

331
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:48,208
but please don't try to use
the stove while I'm gone.

332
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,791
Don't open the door
for any strangers, okay?

333
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,541
And you'll need to take breaks
every now and then...

334
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,333
[HINO] What are you,
his mom or something?

335
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,750
Hey.

336
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:58,625
I'm heading out right now,
but you can hang out here.

337
00:15:58,708 --> 00:15:59,750
I'll be back soon.

338
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,041
[HINO]
Okay.

339
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:04,291
I'm running late already!
See you guys later!

340
00:16:04,375 --> 00:16:07,416
Wait. Where's
he going anyway?

341
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,041
--Let's go.
--Huh?

342
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:12,416
This'll be more fun
than a video game!

343
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,458
[HINO] He's going
on a date? No way.

344
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:18,541
[RYUJI] Look at the signs!
He's heading to town

345
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,666
even though some of his
friends are at his house!

346
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,375
It's definitely a date!

347
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:25,333
Trust me, Ibuki ditches
me like this all the time!

348
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:26,791
It's ready to eat!

349
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:28,708
[IBUKI] I'm actually
going out with Midoriko

350
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:31,250
for dinner tonight. Sorry!

351
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,041
I had to eat all of
that barbeque by myself.

352
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:36,208
[HINO] Oh, I feel
so sorry for you.

353
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:48,333
[BOY 9A laughs]

--[BOYS laugh]
--[BOY 9A] That was fun!

355
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:53,416
[CHIHIRO] I'm sorry I'm late.
Were you waiting a while?

356
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:54,958
It's quite all right.

357
00:16:55,041 --> 00:16:57,958
I don't mind. I was
enjoying the scenery.

358
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:01,583
[HINO] Why would he go on
a date with an old lady?

359
00:17:01,666 --> 00:17:03,458
[RYUJI] Who knows?
Maybe she looks younger

360
00:17:03,541 --> 00:17:05,000
the closer you get.

361
00:17:05,083 --> 00:17:07,208
[HINO]
Are you serious? No way.

362
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,416
She's like a hundred.

363
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,041
So?

364
00:17:10,125 --> 00:17:11,500
Thank you.

365
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,416
Your advice about the birthday
present really helped.

366
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,208
It ended up being
the perfect gift.

367
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,791
My pleasure.
Though I can see no reason

368
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,125
for you to give me
all of the credit.

369
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:23,625
You obviously did a splendid
job picking out his present.

370
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:25,000
[CHIHIRO]
I guess so.

371
00:17:25,083 --> 00:17:28,750
But really, I couldn't
have done it without you.

372
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:31,875
I wanted to make sure to thank
you whenever I saw you again.

373
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,083
[KAZUSA chuckles]

374
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:36,458
You have such a kind soul.

375
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,250
[HINO] I think we're
officially stalkers.

376
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,083
No. We're super spies.

377
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:41,458
[HINO]
But why?

378
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,083
What if Chihiro is some
kind of old lady kidnapper?

379
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,666
[HINO] Will you stop
fooling around?

380
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:48,291
Get down!

381
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,208
Is there something wrong?

382
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:51,583
I'm fine.

383
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:54,583
[CHIHIRO] Those voices
seemed very familiar.

384
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:57,166
[KAZUSA]
I have to admit,

385
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,375
it felt nice to
be able to help you.

386
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:01,875
I haven't bought any gifts
for a while now.

387
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:03,875
[CHIHIRO] Why is that?
Don't you have any relatives

388
00:18:03,958 --> 00:18:05,666
to buy Christmas
or birthday gifts for?

389
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
I did, but both
my son and daughter

390
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:09,166
left home several years ago,

391
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:10,708
and my husband
isn't the type

392
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,625
to get very excited
about much of anything.

393
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,916
[RYUJI slurps]

394
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:22,625
[HINO] I wonder who she is.
She looks kinda familiar.

395
00:18:22,708 --> 00:18:26,333
But maybe, if I'm lucky,
I'll get to meet my grandson.

396
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:29,500
I hope so. I would give him
all kinds of gifts.

397
00:18:29,583 --> 00:18:31,666
[gasps]

398
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,750
So he lives really
far away from you then?

399
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,000
That's hard.

400
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:38,541
I suppose it's
something like that.

401
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:40,291
It seems as though
he's doing well though,

402
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,375
so that's a comfort to me.

403
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,666
It is a bit lonely
from time to time.

404
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,333
I wanted to ask you.

405
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:49,041
Would it be okay if I came to
visit you every so often?

406
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:51,791
Yes it would.
I'd enjoy that.

407
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:53,500
But wouldn't it bore
a young man like you

408
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:55,958
to spend time listening
to an old lady?

409
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:59,791
No. I think I'd like it.

410
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:03,375
Well, I never actually got the
chance to meet my grandparents.

411
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:05,250
It's something I've
always wanted to do.

412
00:19:05,333 --> 00:19:07,250
I bet I'd love them.

413
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:10,916
One day you'll meet them.
They'll love you too.

414
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,125
[MADOKA] Well. She was
estranged from the family

415
00:19:15,208 --> 00:19:16,666
for a long while.

416
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,291
I suppose it's only natural
she'd have considered

417
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,958
herself alone
in the world.

418
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:21,625
[LANDLORD 1A] Hard to believe
that such a young woman

419
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,208
could die of heart failure.

420
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:25,041
[LANDLADY 1A]
She struggled day after day

421
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:27,791
just to make ends meet.

00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:36,916
Okay, let's go.

order that huge thing?

work on an empty stomach!

gonna get us caught!

gonna be so mad at us.

Ah! Does that mean
we can't play games?

Sorry. My friends
can be nosy sometimes.

to spend time with you.

ahead and play with them.

is such a sweet boy.

can raise him properly.

Chihiro be better off with us?

them just once?

00:22:00,166 --> 00:22:01,916
[MADOKA]
So you went on a date?

474
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,291
[CHIHIRO]
No I didn't!

475
00:22:03,375 --> 00:22:04,291
[MADOKA] Who is she?
I have to know

476
00:22:04,375 --> 00:22:05,625
all about her!

477
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,083
[CHIHIRO]
I said it wasn't a date!

478
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,625
But her name is--

479
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:12,708
[CHIHIRO] I forgot
to ask her name.

480
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:53,583
[RYUJI] Hi there! I'm Ryuji
from the Uchoten Boys!

481
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,083
[HINO]
Just call me Hino.

482
00:23:55,166 --> 00:23:56,916
[RYUJI] Is there a reason
you sound so sleepy?

483
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:59,041
[HINO] Yeah, because I
hung out with you all day!

484
00:23:59,125 --> 00:24:00,375
Or do you not remember

485
00:24:00,458 --> 00:24:02,000
dragging me
all over the place?

486
00:24:02,083 --> 00:24:03,375
[RYUJI] All I remember
is that we were caught

487
00:24:03,458 --> 00:24:04,583
because of how loud <i>you</i> were!

488
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,166
[HINO]
Will you let it go?

489
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:08,166
[RYUJI] Can we address how great
I looked in that maid outfit?

490
00:24:08,250 --> 00:24:10,708
I didn't realize housekeepers
had that much leg room!

491
00:24:10,791 --> 00:24:13,375
To be honest I may need a few
aprons for the concert tour.

492
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:14,750
[HINO]
Get over yourself.

493
00:24:14,833 --> 00:24:15,916
[RYUJI]
Next episode:

494
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,541
"No Heat or Cold
Lasts Past the Equinox."

495
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:20,041
[HINO]
We'll see you then!
