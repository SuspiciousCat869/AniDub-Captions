00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,416
[CHIYO]
Oh, come on now, Chihiro!

160
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,750
You gotta perk up!

161
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,541
[CHIHIRO]
If it weren't for me,

162
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,041
maybe Mom would still be alive.

163
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Please come back.

164
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,375
[scuttling]

165
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,250
[scuttling]

166
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,791
[CHIHIRO gasps]

167
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,000
[MADOKA] So where do you
think he ran off to, anyway?

168
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,458
Considering the
direction he went,

169
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:10,000
he's probably in the kitchen.

170
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,583
[gasping]

171
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:16,541
[COCKROACH 1A cackles]

00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:19,500
[CHIHIRO gasps, screams]

173
00:09:19,583 --> 00:09:20,375
[KEIICHIRO gasps]

174
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:21,916
[MADOKA]
The kitchen?

175
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,458
I don't think I've paid it a
visit for three months or so.

176
00:09:26,041 --> 00:09:26,916
[CHIHIRO]
Uh...

177
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:27,750
No...

178
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,333
No! What the heck is this?!

179
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,000
--Chihiro?
--[CHIHIRO] No way...

180
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:35,208
[CHIHIRO] You two must
be out of your minds.

181
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:38,583
You think I would ever
live in this filthy pile?

182
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,625
Oh, wow!

183
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:46,625
Do you suppose washing dishes

184
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,333
could be the
boy's strange hobby?

185
00:09:48,416 --> 00:09:50,708
You know as well as I do
how revolting it is in there.

186
00:09:50,791 --> 00:09:52,625
I've told you many
times to hire somebody.

187
00:09:52,708 --> 00:09:53,875
But I'm not good with strangers.

188
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,125
You should know that by now.

189
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:55,958
[CHIHIRO]
Ugh!

190
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:56,666
[BOTH gasp]

191
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:58,500
This smells like death!

192
00:09:58,583 --> 00:10:00,583
When was this even from?

193
00:10:02,458 --> 00:10:05,833
[CHIHIRO]
Uh... Ugh! Ugh...

194
00:10:07,166 --> 00:10:09,833
Well, guess who just
had himself an idea!

195
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,000
I can't believe it's happening
this early in the year.

196
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:13,166
[MADOKA]
Be nice!

197
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,291
This is the best one
I've had in a while!

198
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:18,041
Considering your track record,
that's not saying much.

199
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:28,083
Finally!

200
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:33,000
[CHIHIRO]
You could eat off the floor!

201
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,375
Listen, you two!

202
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,625
You should try having a
little pride in where you...

203
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:42,500
[CHIHIRO]
Ugh...

204
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:44,416
Ever heard of a duster?

205
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,791
[MADOKA]
Oh!

206
00:10:45,875 --> 00:10:47,458
Have you finished your
chores in time for the ball?

207
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,333
Congratulations, Cinderfella!

208
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,541
[CHIHIRO]
My name is Chihiro.

209
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,166
I'm just giving you a hard time.

210
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,541
However, I really can't
deny how much work

211
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,333
you put into tidying
up the kitchen.

212
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,791
Not a speck of dirt!

213
00:10:57,875 --> 00:11:00,291
You really need to hire
a housekeeper or somethin'.

214
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,625
There are so many
health-code violations.

215
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,291
I think that's a wonderful idea!

216
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,416
I already have someone
in mind for the job.

217
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,875
That's good to know.

218
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,666
[MADOKA]
Three meals a day plus snacks.

219
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:13,083
It'd be a live-in position,
and cover school fees!

220
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,916
Sound good? What do ya think?

221
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,458
Huh?

222
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,833
You'd hate to be indebted
to the Takatori family.

223
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:20,500
So I'd like to
offer an opportunity

224
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,458
where you can earn
your keep instead.

225
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:24,250
A little give and take!

226
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,000
[CHIYO] P.S. Those who
do not work shall not eat.

227
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,000
[CHIHIRO]
How... did she know?

228
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:33,125
Huh?

229
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:34,291
Okay then.

230
00:11:34,375 --> 00:11:35,291
I'll clean this dump for you,

231
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:38,041
but I can still
leave at any time!

232
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,166
I'd think that
sounds pretty fair!

233
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,625
[MADOKA]
You're hired, Chihiro.

234
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,166
You gotta be kidding!

235
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,666
You can't work
without a uniform.

236
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,416
[CHIHIRO] Fine, but does it
really need to be so frilly?

237
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,875
Oh, you don't like the ruffles?

238
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,083
I think they suit you.

239
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,166
[CHIHIRO]
I'm outta here! Sicko.

240
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,500
[MADOKA]
Come now.

241
00:12:00,583 --> 00:12:02,333
Being adorable will make
you work that much harder!

242
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:03,958
That doesn't make
any sense at all!

243
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:05,041
[MADOKA]
Would you be more comfortable

244
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,041
in a different color?

245
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,416
I've got pink and
yellow as well!

246
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,958
[CHIHIRO]
It's not about the color!

247
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:10,333
[MADOKA]
How sad.

248
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,333
I had hoped we would get
along better than this, Chi.

249
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,333
[CHIHIRO] I'd hoped that you
wouldn't be a total lunatic!

250
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:16,750
And don't call me Chi!

251
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:29,208
[KEIICHIRO] You're telling me
that he's been cleaning

252
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:31,583
without a break
since last night?

253
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,083
[MADOKA]
Mm-hm.

254
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,500
[yawns]

255
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,000
Why's he still running around?

256
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,375
Are you trying to work him
to death his first week here?

257
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,666
No.

258
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,500
I told him he needed
to stop working and rest,

259
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,583
but then he got all snippy!

260
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:44,791
He said:

261
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,875
How can you sleep in
a dump like this, huh?

262
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,208
[MADOKA sobs] I can't believe
he disrespected our home!

263
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:51,750
You play the victim well,
but you know he was justified.

264
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:52,958
You could have
told him this room

265
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,125
is always available
if he wants to relax.

266
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:58,166
I make sure to keep it clean
in case guests stop by.

267
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:01,083
Well... I tried, but,

268
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,083
he said all of the corners
were caked with dirt

269
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,416
and it repulsed him,
so he just started cleaning

270
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,083
from top to bottom.

271
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,791
[KEIICHIRO]
I dusted yesterday.

272
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,041
[MADOKA]
Besides.

273
00:13:11,125 --> 00:13:12,708
It looked like he was
really enjoying himself,

274
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,666
so I didn't want to disturb him.

275
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:17,125
I figured he'd
tire out eventually.

276
00:13:17,208 --> 00:13:18,625
[KEIICHIRO]
That makes sense.

277
00:13:18,708 --> 00:13:21,375
Now tell me why he's wearing
a maid's apron and headband.

278
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,958
[MADOKA]
Oh, so you noticed!

279
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,541
I made the outfit myself!

280
00:13:24,625 --> 00:13:26,041
When I told him
it was his uniform,

281
00:13:26,125 --> 00:13:27,583
I didn't think he'd
actually put it on!

282
00:13:27,666 --> 00:13:29,750
But what can you do?
There's no going back now.

283
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:31,833
[KEIICHIRO] Toying with
a grieving child's trust.

284
00:13:31,916 --> 00:13:33,125
That's healthy.

285
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,000
Come on, it looks
absolutely adorable on him!

286
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,333
Which is why I
made several extras

287
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:37,791
so he'd have a lot
of color options!

288
00:13:37,875 --> 00:13:39,708
In other words, you've
accomplished nothing

289
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,666
and basically wasted
most of the day?

290
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,333
Ah! I've been found out!

291
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:45,708
This is my house!

292
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:48,500
All I ask is that you complete
one worthwhile task.

293
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:50,333
[CHIHIRO]
Finally made it to the next one.

294
00:13:52,791 --> 00:13:54,083
[groans]

295
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,041
[CHIHIRO] Every single room
in this place is dirty!

296
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:57,416
You deserve to be evicted!

297
00:13:57,500 --> 00:13:58,875
This is why there's
no good reason to have

298
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,583
this many rooms in one house!

299
00:14:00,666 --> 00:14:02,166
It's not like you're
using them for anything

300
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,958
other than hiding your junk!

301
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,833
I'm so exhausted.

302
00:14:13,458 --> 00:14:17,041
[CHIHIRO]
I just want... to go back home.

303
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:19,375
[gasps]

304
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:21,416
I have to face reality!

305
00:14:22,750 --> 00:14:23,208
[gasps]

306
00:14:23,291 --> 00:14:23,833
[clatter]

307
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,000
[BOTH]
Huh?

308
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,541
[gasps]

309
00:14:26,625 --> 00:14:27,916
[MADOKA]
What happened?

310
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:30,458
Oh, dear.

311
00:14:32,250 --> 00:14:33,750
Please don't pick it up
with your bare hands.

312
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,708
I'll be right back with a broom.

313
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:38,541
Are you all right?

314
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,833
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah, I'm fine.

315
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,166
I can pay for it.

316
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:45,541
A broken vase is the least
of my worries right now.

317
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,875
So please, humor me
by trying to sleep.

318
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,583
I'm not even tired!

319
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,958
[MADOKA] There's really no need
to be so stubborn about this.

320
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,708
Look, I told you I'm fine,
so just leave me alone!

321
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,291
[KEIICHIRO]
Chihiro.

322
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:02,083
Please don't rush yourself.

323
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:03,666
You've been through
quite an ordeal.

324
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:06,750
It takes time to settle
in to a new place.

325
00:15:06,833 --> 00:15:08,541
And it really is
disgusting in here.

326
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,000
My feelings!

327
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,416
[KEIICHIRO]
Listen.

328
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,500
You won't last much longer
if you're always on guard.

329
00:15:13,583 --> 00:15:15,750
Take a moment
to breathe, to relax.

330
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:18,791
Please know you're welcome
to call this your home.

331
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,583
I'm so sorry. I really am.

332
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:25,708
[CHIHIRO]
Home...

333
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,875
My home...

334
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,958
No. I don't know anything
about this place.

335
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,083
Uh, Chihiro?

336
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:40,625
[MADOKA]
He's sleeping?

337
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:41,500
[KEIICHIRO]
Finally.

338
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:42,833
That's good.

339
00:15:42,916 --> 00:15:44,708
We can take this time to
set up a bedroom for him.

340
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,000
[KEIICHIRO]
Huh?

341
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,375
Everything happened so suddenly

342
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:50,000
I had no way of preparing
for his arrival.

343
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,958
How about we make this house
a home, what do you say?

[KEIICHIRO]
What shall I do with this thing?

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,708
[MADOKA]
Oh, you can throw that away.

350
00:16:15,833 --> 00:16:17,416
Hello there! I hope
you slept well.

351
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,250
You were out for a while!

352
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,916
What are you two doing?

353
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,666
We're busy getting a
bedroom ready for you!

354
00:16:22,750 --> 00:16:24,000
Huh?

355
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,333
[MADOKA] The original plan
was to have you choose

356
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,708
which room you liked the
most, but then I figured

357
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,166
you could move if this one
isn't to your tastes.

358
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
To be honest, I've
never actually had

359
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:40,250
my own room before.

360
00:16:42,583 --> 00:16:45,041
Now that we're done cleaning,
why don't we have afternoon tea?

361
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,541
Maybe a few sweet treats?

362
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:48,208
[KEIICHIRO]
That sounds great.

363
00:16:52,416 --> 00:16:53,166
[CHIHIRO]
Cleaning?

364
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,500
[MADOKA, KEIICHIRO]
Hm?

365
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:56,833
You can look me in the eye

366
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,458
and tell me this
seems clean to you?

367
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:00,000
[BOTH gasping]

368
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,416
[CHIHIRO]
Do it again.

369
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:11,541
[CHIHIRO] Well, I guess
that about does it!

[doorbell buzzes]

371
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,333
[DELIVERY MAN 1A]
We appreciate your business!

372
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:24,750
You love it so much
you're speechless!

373
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,333
Only the finest linens
for my little nephew!

374
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:29,541
[KEIICHIRO] Don't be afraid to
tell him if this hideous thing

375
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:31,458
isn't to your liking.

376
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,083
[CHIHIRO]
Anything's fine.

377
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,458
Amazing!

378
00:17:36,541 --> 00:17:38,791
Really, Chi, is there
anything you can't do?

379
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:40,250
You didn't have to
make me anything

380
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,791
but I'll savor every bite.

381
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:43,333
[CHIHIRO] There's seconds
if you want more.

382
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:44,333
[MADOKA]
It's been so long

383
00:17:44,416 --> 00:17:46,125
since I've had a
home-cooked meal!

384
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:47,666
Mm! It's perfect!

385
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:48,833
I'm glad you like
it and everything,

386
00:17:48,916 --> 00:17:50,416
but it's really not
that big of a deal.

387
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:51,875
[MADOKA] This isn't the
time to be modest.

388
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,708
You should have a cooking show!

389
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,958
[sighs]

390
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:11,750
[CHIHIRO]
My own room. Wow.

391
00:18:11,833 --> 00:18:13,916
--So you really like it?
--[CHIHIRO yelps]

392
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,791
Will you please knock
before you come in here?

393
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:17,958
I'll attempt to,
but I may forget.

394
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:20,333
I thought I'd take a crack
at bonding with you tonight.

395
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,750
What do you think?
Love is a good topic, right?

396
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:24,083
[CHIHIRO]
I don't wanna bond with you!

397

[MADOKA]
Hm...

401
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:50,958
[CHIHIRO]
What's he doing?

402
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:53,958
Tell me something.

403
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,791
Which color do you prefer:
pink or purple?

404
00:18:55,875 --> 00:18:57,458
Green is my favorite color.

405
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,166
Green, you say?

406
00:18:59,250 --> 00:19:00,791
Why are you asking?

407
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,208
[MADOKA]
Hm.

408
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,708
Hey, uh...

409
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,291
This is normal behavior for him,

410
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,458
so I wouldn't worry
too much if I were you.

411
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,416
He's acting even
weirder than usual

412
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:12,708
and he didn't finish eating.

413
00:19:12,791 --> 00:19:15,166
His deadline for the
play is coming up soon.

414
00:19:15,250 --> 00:19:17,458
He usually gets a burst of
inspiration towards the end

415
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,583
and works like a mad man.

416
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,083
Oh, so he's an actor?

417
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:23,250
[KEIICHIRO] He didn't tell you
what he does for a living?

418
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:24,708
Believe it or not, Master Madoka

419
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:27,208
is an extremely talented
costume designer.

420
00:19:27,291 --> 00:19:30,166
[CHIHIRO] Oh. He's always
at home, so I just assumed

421
00:19:30,250 --> 00:19:31,666
that he was some
eccentric creep.

422
00:19:31,750 --> 00:19:33,083
Ah...

If you clean it up, I won't
be able to find anything!

427
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,166
[CHIHIRO] I've never seen
him sit so quietly.

428
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,500
He's focusing.

429
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:05,708
He's different than
he usually is--

430
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:08,291
like a mature
adult or something.

431
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,416
[knocking]

432
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,708
[MADOKA]
Hm?

Huh?

00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,625
Take a break.

435
00:20:29,041 --> 00:20:30,291
So you actually made
all the clothes

436
00:20:30,375 --> 00:20:31,958
in this room from scratch?

437
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:34,041
[MADOKA]
Mm. I sure did.

438
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,333
[CHIHIRO]
Hm.

439
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,458
What's that for?

440
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:43,000
I just need to borrow
your head for a moment.

441
00:20:47,833 --> 00:20:49,166
Don't you need to sleep?

442
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,125
[MADOKA]
I'm too busy to stop.

443
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,958
You're gonna get sick if
you don't get enough rest.

444
00:20:55,041 --> 00:20:57,791
I noticed you didn't eat
very much food today either.

445

Oh, that's so adorable!

00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:04,125
I can't believe you're
actually worrying about me!

00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,625
[CHIHIRO]
No I'm not!

448
00:21:05,708 --> 00:21:07,583
I usually quit for the night
when I hit a stopping point.

449
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,708
No need to worry yourself!

yourself! It's all okay!

[CHIHIRO gasps]

452
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:19,125
You shouldn't push
yourself too hard.

453
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:21,916
Everyone needs to take
a break from time to time.

454
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,333
I'll rest, I promise.

455
00:21:25,416 --> 00:21:28,000
And I assure you,
I keep my promises.

456
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,583
What's that even mean?

457
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,333
[MADOKA]
It's a secret.

458
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,541
[CHIYO] Remember that
life usually works out

459
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:40,833
okay in the end, so you don't

460
00:21:40,916 --> 00:21:42,916
have to stress
about it too much.

461
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,125
[CHIHIRO]
I still don't know for sure

462
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,791
if things are gonna turn out.

463
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:49,041
But I'm going to keep
doing my best--for her!

Finally finished!

You're really through?

466
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,791
So that's the last of it, right?

467
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,250
I'm all done. Take a look!

468
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:03,375
[MADOKA]
So cute-meow! It fits pawfectly!

I guess I caught cat
scratch fever last night!

What about your work?

[CHIHIRO] No goofing around
until you're finished!

475
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:52,541
[KEIICHIRO]
Good evening, everyone.

476
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:55,666
I'm Keiichiro Shinozaki, Master
Madoka's personal assistant.

477
00:23:55,750 --> 00:23:57,083
[MADOKA]
Who exactly are you talking to?

478
00:23:57,166 --> 00:23:59,333
[KEIICHIRO] I have known
Master Madoka since childhood.

479
00:23:59,416 --> 00:24:01,708
I remember all of the most
important details about him.

480
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:03,041
[MADOKA]
Like what?

481
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:03,875
[KEIICHIRO] Well, for
one thing, you really love

482
00:24:03,958 --> 00:24:04,791
the look of gathered frills.

483
00:24:04,875 --> 00:24:06,000
[MADOKA]
That's very true.

484
00:24:06,083 --> 00:24:07,250
Would you like for me
to add pretty frills

485
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:08,250
to all of your shirts?

486
00:24:08,333 --> 00:24:08,958
[KEIICHIRO]
No thank you, sir.

487
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:10,375
[MADOKA]
Why not?

488
00:24:10,458 --> 00:24:11,708
[KEIICHIRO] Because I feel
that someone who actually

489
00:24:11,791 --> 00:24:13,500
looks good in frills may
be appearing soon enough.

490
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:14,291
[MADOKA]
Don't tell me...

491
00:24:14,375 --> 00:24:15,333
[KEIICHIRO]
Next time:

492
00:24:15,416 --> 00:24:16,500
"Failure Is the
Mother of Success."

493
00:24:16,583 --> 00:24:18,250
Feel free to frill
to your heart's content.

494
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:20,083
[MADOKA]
Hooray! Please watch!
