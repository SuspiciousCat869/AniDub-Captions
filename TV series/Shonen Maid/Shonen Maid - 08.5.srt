I dunno, for being slow.

29
00:01:08,791 --> 00:01:10,958
In my opinion it's better
to do quality work

30
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:12,375
than speed through things.

31
00:01:12,458 --> 00:01:15,125
I mean, the places you
already wiped down look good.

The best way to

is with something
that's homemade.

You made some for me,

00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,541
when it comes to
baking and stuff.

318
00:14:04,625 --> 00:14:06,916
[TAKEI] For sure, he always
makes really amazing sweets

319
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,958
when we come over to hang out!

320
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:12,000
If you gotta eat it,
why not make it delicious?

321
00:14:13,958 --> 00:14:17,708
[CHIHIRO] Fine then. No more
cookies for you traitors.

322
00:14:17,791 --> 00:14:20,458
[AMAHARA, HINO, TAKEI]
What a sore loser.

323
00:14:20,541 --> 00:14:23,916
[KEIICHIRO] Basically, you can't
figure out your White Day gifts.

324
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,458
Is that what you're
worried about?

325
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:26,750
[CHIHIRO]
Mm-hm.

326
00:14:26,833 --> 00:14:29,875
I think a homemade
gift is a fine idea.

327
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:31,583
Though I have to admit,
I usually end up

328
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:32,833
buying mine from a store.

329
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,583
A store, huh?

330
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:37,916
[KEIICHIRO] Although, this
year I am a little stumped.

331
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,958
Why's that?

332
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,833
Well, because
Master Madoka said:

333
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,791
What? You're gonna
have to do better

334
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:46,416
than a stuffed animal.
Only little kids like those!

335
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,583
And that's what he pointed out.

336
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,458
Yeah, he's one to talk.

337
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,458
[KEIICHIRO] Now what? I don't
have the faintest clue

338
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,958
of what sort of things a high
school girl would even like.

339
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:56,250
I searched the internet...

340
00:14:56,333 --> 00:14:57,791
[CHIHIRO] I have a feeling
he could give Miyako

341
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,875
just about anything and she'd
be over the moon for it.

342
00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,416
Anyway...

343
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:04,041
Did you know that
Master Madoka prefers

344
00:15:04,125 --> 00:15:06,000
to make homemade
gifts every year?

345
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,708
Maybe ask him for advice.

346
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,500
[groans]

347
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,791
[CHIHIRO]
Stare...

348
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:19,208
Stare...

349
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,083
[MADOKA] Uh... Hi.
Did you need something?

350
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,791
[CHIHIRO]
Are you baking?

351
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,416
I am. I thought I would go ahead

352
00:15:26,500 --> 00:15:28,875
and get started on
my White Day presents.

353
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:33,958
Am I... in the way?

354
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,708
Nope, go ahead.

355
00:15:35,791 --> 00:15:38,291
Uh... If you insist.

356
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:48,708
[CHIHIRO]
Clean up as you go!

357
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,875
I'm sorry!

358
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,166
[ding]

359
00:15:56,333 --> 00:16:00,333
[MADOKA] Hm... Chi, which one
of these do you like best?

360
00:16:00,416 --> 00:16:02,166
I'm too busy cleaning to look!

361
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,833
[MADOKA] Aw, don't be
like that, just try one.

362
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,583
[CHIHIRO]
It's good.

363
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,375
[CHIHIRO]
Um, hey.

364
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,708
[MADOKA sighs]
Yeah?

365
00:16:18,791 --> 00:16:21,750
Listen. I was just
wondering if you'd

366
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:23,291
teach me how to bake.

367
00:16:26,333 --> 00:16:27,291
Huh?

368
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:31,916
Ooh... Yes!

369
00:16:34,375 --> 00:16:36,083
All righty, ready
to get started?

370
00:16:36,166 --> 00:16:37,500
What is this?

371
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,166
They're for pastry chefs.

372
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,875
I made them in case
we baked together,

373
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,375
and now we get to be twinsies!

374
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,000
Hooray for us.

375
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,833
[MADOKA]
So what should we make, Chi?

376
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:47,458
How about macarons?

377
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:48,750
What are macarons?

378
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,250
[MADOKA]
Feast your eyes!

379
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:54,208
Girls love these cookies.
Maybe because they're so cute.

380
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,666
Could I learn to make them?

381
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:58,333
Oui, mon amie.
That's why I'm here!

382
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:01,416
Step one, separate the
egg yolks from the whites.

383
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,625
'Kay.

384
00:17:15,708 --> 00:17:17,416
[MADOKA] Now we have
to freeze the egg whites.

385
00:17:17,500 --> 00:17:19,958
[CHIHIRO] What? Why do
we have to freeze them?

386
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:21,708
Because when
egg whites are fresh

387
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:23,458
they can make the batter runny.

388
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:24,541
[CHIHIRO]
Huh.

389
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,458
[CHIHIRO]
Uh...

390
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:30,791
But waiting for them
to freeze is super boring.

391
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,541
[CHIHIRO]
Huh?

392
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:34,708
So here's some egg whites
I froze yesterday!

393
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,291
Take those out first!

394
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,958
[MADOKA]
Next, measure everything out,

395
00:17:39,041 --> 00:17:41,958
combine the dry
ingredients and sift,

396
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,708
then put them into the fridge.

397
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:44,500
[CHIHIRO]
Again?

398
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,041
Yep! It's kind of like

399
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:48,333
a really neat
science experiment!

400
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,083
If you mess up the
measurements even a bit,

401
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,250
it'll ruin everything.

402
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:52,541
[CHIHIRO]
Uh...

403
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,458
[CHIHIRO]
There's only a little left,

404
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,125
so I'll just throw it all in!

405
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:05,000
Okay, the next
part is important.

406
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:07,958
Once you're done mixing
everything, macaronage time.

407
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:09,708
Maca-what-ty?

408
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:11,916
You know! Swirly twirly!

409
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,583
"Swirly twirly"?

410
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,833
[MADOKA]
Do it like this.

411
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,833
Uh, this way?

412
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,833
Kind of, but try to make
it more floopy-whoopy!

413
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,625
Can you use real words?

414
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:33,125
Huh?

415
00:18:35,375 --> 00:18:36,708
What's the matter?

416
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:39,500
[CHIHIRO] Well, I might be
having an identity crisis.

417
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,541
[ding]

418
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,250
[CHIHIRO]
Hm...

419
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,000
Those look pretty good,
'specially for your first try.

420
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,750
You think so?

421
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:57,583
[MADOKA] It's okay that
they're not exactly perfect.

422
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,791
You did your best and it's
a gift from the heart,

423
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:02,958
which makes it perfect in
a different kind of way.

424
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,750
I guess that's true.

425
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:07,291
[MADOKA] If you're really
that worried, you could still

426
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,916
make them look nice by
dressing them up a little.

427
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
What's that thing?

428
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,750
It's a handmade pouch.

429
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,375
You could put
the macarons inside

430
00:19:15,458 --> 00:19:17,541
to add a charming touch.

431
00:19:17,625 --> 00:19:19,500
They're mostly made
from my sewing scraps,

432
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:22,791
so it's like killing
two birds with one stone.

433
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,125
Do you have anymore
of those scraps?

434
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,250
[CHIHIRO] Unfortunately,
I only know how to make

435
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,458
a simple drawstring pouch.

436
00:19:31,541 --> 00:19:34,583
No problem, I'll just use some
cute fabric to make up for it.

437
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:41,083
Uh--

438
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,875
What's the heck? Are those cats?

439
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:46,083
I swear. He's like
a crazy cat lady.

[MADOKA chuckles]

442
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,000
Done!

443
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:09,791
[HINO] So you were up
all night making pouches?

444
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,125
[TAKEI]
You look tired.

445
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,375
I'm fine. Will you
please give these

446
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,625
to your older sisters, and Hana?

447
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,708
Yeah, man, sure thing.

[NOMURA yelps]
Who, me?

450
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:25,208
Here, thank you for
the Valentine's chocolate.

451
00:20:25,291 --> 00:20:27,666
Oh, thanks so much.

452
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:32,458
All right!

453
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,625
Wow! Isn't that wonderful?

454
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:35,875
Yeah.

455
00:20:40,625 --> 00:20:43,708
[MIYAKO] Oh my! It looks
just like my sweet Antaro!

456
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,541
It's beyond cute!
Thank you so much, Chihiro!

457
00:20:46,625 --> 00:20:49,166
Sure thing. And, by the way.

458
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:50,791
What's with the bear?

459
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,458
It's a White Day
gift from Keiichiro,

460
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,208
isn't it precious?

461
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,750
[CHIHIRO] He ended up giving
her a stuffed animal after all?

462
00:21:01,583 --> 00:21:03,583
[MIYAKO]
See this chain here on its neck?

463
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:07,416
It's actually a bracelet.
Know what else?

464
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,333
This is the first time
ever that Keiichiro

465
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:11,750
has given me any
type of jewelry.

466
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:15,166
[CHIHIRO]
That's awesome!

467
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:16,541
[MIYAKO]
Yes!

[MADOKA]
Come in.

470
00:21:21,708 --> 00:21:23,416
[CHIHIRO]
Thanks for letting me use these.

471
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:25,958
Sure. Did you make
some cute pouches?

472
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:30,166
[CHIHIRO] Uh... I dunno, Miyako
seemed to like it at any rate.

473
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,750
I wish I could have seen them.

474

next year I could

00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,625
teach you how to gather frills.

476
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:36,166
No thanks, I think I'll pass.

Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead

479
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,500
and get some sleep. Goodnight.

Sweet dreams!

What's this?

[CHIHIRO] "Thanks for
teaching me how to bake.

484
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,000
It was a big help."

00:22:02,583 --> 00:22:04,625
He really is a good kid.

486
00:22:10,416 --> 00:22:13,250
[NOMURA] I wonder if
Komiya's into monsters?
