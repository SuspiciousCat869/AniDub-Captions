00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,166
No, he told me that

162
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:13,250
class is finished
for today, so...

163
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:15,250
You can take the evening off.

164
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,666
[MIYAKO sighs]

165
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,208
All done!

166
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:28,291
Um, I guess I got
a little carried away.

167
00:07:28,375 --> 00:07:31,041
[CHIHIRO yawns]

168
00:07:32,375 --> 00:07:34,333
[door creaks]

169
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:38,291
[CHIHIRO]
It's cold out here.

170
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,083
[MIYAKO]
Oh, Chihiro.

171
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,250
I didn't know you were still up.

172
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:42,666
Have you been working
this whole time?

173
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:45,916
Me? Uh, yeah, but only
because I'm a real stickler

174
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,166
when it comes to cleaning.

175
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:48,791
It's because of me, right?

176
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,500
I've done nothing but
cause you trouble today.

177
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,500
Looks like I'll
never be independent.

178
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,291
At this point, I should
probably give up

179
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,791
and do whatever Father tells me.

180
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:03,833
[MIYAKO] A while back, our
families made an agreement.

181
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,958
And they decided that,
when I turned 16,

182
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,166
Madoka and I would get married.

183
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:10,416
Don't get me wrong,
he's really nice and all,

184
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,750
but I want--

185
00:08:11,833 --> 00:08:13,791
Well, I tried to tell my
family I wanted to choose

186
00:08:13,875 --> 00:08:16,333
who I would marry,
but they called me selfish.

187
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:18,000
[CHIHIRO]
You aren't being selfish!

188
00:08:18,083 --> 00:08:19,250
What?

189
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,916
Why would anybody force
you to marry that guy?

190
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,958
What cruel and
unusual punishment!

191
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,833
[MIYAKO] You are truly
wise beyond your years!

192
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:26,791
[MADOKA sneezes]

193
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,083
And, more importantly,

194
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:30,083
I get the feeling that
maybe you like Keiichiro

195
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,166
more than my uncle.

196
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,458
What? Why would you think that?

197
00:08:33,541 --> 00:08:35,416
[CHIHIRO]
Just a hunch.

198
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,583
[MIYAKO]
The secret's out!

199
00:08:36,666 --> 00:08:38,791
I guess I can't hide
my feelings anymore!

200
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:40,375
Were you trying to hide them?

201
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:42,083
You fooled me.

202
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,625
Come on, be honest.

203
00:08:43,708 --> 00:08:46,125
Did you do all this house work
stuff to impress Keiichiro?

204
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:50,583
Yes, I wanted to, but,
well, you saw me today.

205
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:54,541
I was terrible. Really terrible.

206
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,958
All I did was make
a mess of everything.

207
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:59,541
I'll never impress him.
Like I said, I should give up

208
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:02,958
and do whatever Father
tells me, like always.

209
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:10,625
[CHIHIRO] "You should
never betray yourself.

210
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,791
Sometimes in life,
compromise is necessary,

211
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,125
but don't do anything that
goes against your heart."

212
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,958
So Mom said.

213
00:09:18,041 --> 00:09:19,541
There's only one way to fail--

214
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,916
and that's giving up
before you've tried.

215
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,416
Except I did fail.

216
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,875
I couldn't do anything right.

217
00:09:25,958 --> 00:09:28,750
No, not true--you made
an amazing dinner.

218
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,458
It tasted great!

219
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:31,708
If I can teach you how to clean

220
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:34,333
as well as you cook,
then you'll be golden.

221
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,083
That means a lot.

222
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,250
You know what?

223
00:09:41,333 --> 00:09:44,250
From here on out,
I'm going to start putting

224
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,750
more faith in myself.

225
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,041
[MADOKA sneezes]

226
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:53,458
Hello, sir.

227
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:57,333
Yes, right. I think
things should be fine now.

228
00:09:57,416 --> 00:10:00,500
Okay then, why don't you stop by
and pick her up tomorrow.

229
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,625
[MADOKA]
Perfect, now do a turn!

230
00:10:06,708 --> 00:10:07,708
[giggles]

231
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,833
[MADOKA]
Oh, you're too cute for words!

232
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:12,458
Wear this uniform while you're
training with Chi, okay?

233
00:10:12,541 --> 00:10:13,458
[MIYAKO]
'Kay!

234
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,291
And I promise to
keep working hard!

235
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,208
It's surprising how
fast he manages

236
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,291
--to make stuff like that.
--[doorbell buzzes]

237
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,500
I'll get it this time.

238
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,333
[doorbell buzzes]

239
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:27,708
[MADOKA] By the way,
guess what else I made?

240
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:30,333
Mini Miyako and
Keiichiro cookies!

241
00:10:30,416 --> 00:10:31,958
Those are too adorable!

242
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:32,958
I know!

243
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,208
Wait a sec--

244
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:36,250
Does that mean you
wrecked my kitchen again?

245
00:10:36,333 --> 00:10:38,041
[MADOKA] "Wrecked" is such
a destructive word.

246
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,291
There's only a little
flour here and there.

247
00:10:40,375 --> 00:10:41,791
I just cleaned in there!

248
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:43,541
I can't leave you
alone for five minutes!

249
00:10:43,625 --> 00:10:45,625
[MADOKA whimpers]
Stop yelling at me!

250
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,541
[MIYAKO] Don't be mad!
I'll help clean it up!

251
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,333
[MIYAKO'S FATHER] I'm not
sure what to do with Miyako.

252
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,875
I hope she hasn't
caused you any trouble.

253
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:53,541
[MADOKA]
Chi, I said stop it!

254
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,666
[BOTH]
Huh?

255
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,333
Miyako, It's time--

256
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:58,291
[BOTH gasp]

257
00:10:58,375 --> 00:10:59,750
Time to do what?

258
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:00,833
Huh?

259
00:11:03,541 --> 00:11:06,583
Huh? Madoka!

260
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,041
What is the meaning of this?

261
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,875
Explain yourself!

262
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:12,208
Well, I guess the
cat's out of the bag.

263
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:13,708
I like maids.

264
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:17,041
[MIYAKO'S FATHER] We're leaving
this instant, young lady!

265
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:19,833
[MIYAKO] Uh! Wait,
what's your rush? Father?

266
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:22,708
[MIYAKO'S FATHER]
Madoka, I believed you were

267
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,750
a high-caliber man.
Clearly that was a mistake.

268
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,333
I'm calling off the engagement!

269
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,416
It's a good thing you found out
sooner rather than later.

270
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:33,791
[MIYAKO'S FATHER]
I forbid you from ever seeing

271
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,791
that miscreant again!
Do you understand me, Miyako?

272
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,166
Just because he likes cosplay

273
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:40,375
doesn't mean he's
a miscreant, Father!

274
00:11:40,458 --> 00:11:44,500
I'm sorry, everyone!
Sorry, Keiichiro!

275
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,333
[KEIICHIRO, CHIHIRO]
Uh...

276
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,125
Yeah, you are crass.

277
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:51,416
That's rude; I was only
trying to be heroic.

278
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,041
[CHIHIRO] You could've just
refused like an adult, idiot!

279
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,958
[MADOKA] No name-calling!
I worked hard!

280
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,916
Hey! Look who it is.

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,458
Komiya! Up here!

282
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:09,833
Hey!

283
00:12:09,916 --> 00:12:11,750
[HINO] I haven't seen you
at school in a while.

284
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,125
Everything okay?

285
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,500
Someone told me that you
moved in with your uncle.

286
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,583
Is it true?

287
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,791
Yeah.

288
00:12:17,875 --> 00:12:19,250
I'm sorry, I really
meant to tell you guys.

289
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,458
But I'll be coming
back to school

290
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,166
after the Golden Week holiday.

291
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:22,875
Yeah?

292
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:23,958
That's cool.

293
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,750
Hey, tell us all
about your new place!

294
00:12:25,833 --> 00:12:28,208
And what's your
uncle like? Is he nice?

295
00:12:28,291 --> 00:12:31,208
He's kinda weird, but I
suppose he's nice enough.

296
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:33,083
Except for the mai--

297
00:12:33,166 --> 00:12:34,666
[CHIHIRO] Wait, I can't
tell them about that!

298
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,041
They'll just make fun of me!

299
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,875
"May?" May what?

300
00:12:37,958 --> 00:12:38,708
Uh--

301
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:39,916
May-be I'm over thinking it!

302
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,208
In fact, everything
is fine! Totally normal!

303
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,416
And boring! Yep!

304
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,458
Well... Okay.

305
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,666
Hey, Komiya, what's wrong?

306
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:49,250
You're acting kinda strange.

307
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,708
[yelps] Me?

308
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,416
No, the other Komiya.
Of course I mean you!

309
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,958
What? No, I'm cool! Ha.

310
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,416
Look, if you need
help or whatever--

Seriously guys, I'm just
fine! Everything's good!

Ah, gee, it's gettin' late!
I should probably be going now!

Hey, what's the rush?

314
00:13:09,583 --> 00:13:12,083
[CHIHIRO sighs] Man, I feel
bad for ditching them,

315
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,791
but what else could I do?

316
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,416
This isn't something
that's easy to explain.

317
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,541
Nope.

00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:27,458
Wow... This place is huge!

320
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,000
You gotta be kidding.
He lives here?

321
00:13:30,083 --> 00:13:32,666
It's like a modern day
Orphan Annie story.

322
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,500
Well, he's okay.
So let's go, I guess.

323
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:36,583
[door clicks]

324
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,000
[TAKEI, HINO, AMAHARA]
Huh?

325
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,791
[TAKEI, HINO, AMAHARA]
Komiya?!

326
00:13:43,875 --> 00:13:45,125
[shrieks]

327
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,541
[HINO] Man, I knew something
strange was going on.

328
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:53,041
[CHIHIRO] Can we pretend
this didn't happen?

329
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,375
[HINO, TAKEI, AMAHARA]
No way.

330
00:13:54,458 --> 00:13:56,500
At the park, you told us
everything was just fine.

331
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:58,333
Come on, fess up. Is that true?

332
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:00,041
Yes, absolutely!

333
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,916
Then, what's up with
the whole maid outfit?

334
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:03,666
Are they forcing you
to work for them?

335
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,333
No, they're not! It's
nothing like that at all.

336
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,833
You'd hate to be indebted
to the Takitori family,

337
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,541
so I'd like to offer
you an opportunity.

338
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:15,166
In the end, I only
have myself to blame

339
00:14:15,250 --> 00:14:16,166
for all this.

340
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:17,625
So cosplay's your thing, huh?

341
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:19,250
--[CHIHIRO yelps]
--Talk about surprising.

342
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,250
[TAKEI, AMAHARA]
Yep.

343
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,250
[CHIHIRO]
I am not into cosplay!

344
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,041
This happens to be
my work uniform!

345
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,916
[TAKEI, AMAHARA]
Your work uniform?

346
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:27,458
[HINO] Well, I guess it's cool,
as long as you're okay.

347
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,333
And the clothes aren't
half bad, either.

348
00:14:29,416 --> 00:14:30,833
You actually pull it off.

349
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:33,916
Thanks a lot, but you guys
don't have to lie to me, 'kay?

350
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,083
[HINO]
We're not.

351
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:37,500
Think we'd make fun
of you for working?

352
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,083
That would make us
pretty crappy friends.

353
00:14:39,166 --> 00:14:41,208
In the future, just be
honest with us, okay?

354
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:43,708
We're supposed to
stick together and stuff.

355
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,750
[MADOKA]
So true!

356
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:49,791
It warms my heart to see that
you have such caring friends!

357
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,083
[HINO, TAKEI, AMAHARA yelp]

358
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,958
By the way, I'm Chihiro's uncle.

359
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:54,208
Nice to meet--

360
00:14:54,291 --> 00:14:58,916
[CHIHIRO] How many times
have I said to knock?

361
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,458
Dumb idiot!

362
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,375
[HINO]
See ya!

363
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,750
[TAKEI]
Yeah, see ya at school!

364
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,375
[AMAHARA]
Bye, Komiya!

365
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,125
[laughs]

366
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:07,625
They seem like a good group.

367
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,833
Yeah. I'd like to invite them
back over again sometime.

368
00:15:10,916 --> 00:15:12,250
Of course!

369
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,708
When you do, I'll be sure
to bake them some cookies!

370
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,000
[CHIHIRO]
You stay out of my kitchen!

371
00:15:21,458 --> 00:15:23,166
All right, teacher!
I'm finished!

372
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:28,416
[CHIHIRO]
Food's done. Cleanup's done.

373
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,041
Good. A-plus work!

374
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,750
[laughs] This is
the best day ever!

375
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:37,708
Yes, yes, wonderful work!
I was wondering...

376
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,583
Can we eat? I'm starving.

377
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,416
Next we need to work on
finishing it a little faster.

378
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,541
Yes, sir!

379
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:49,791
[MADOKA] So, you two have a
cooking class every Sunday?

380
00:15:49,875 --> 00:15:52,083
I'm impressed by how
hard Miyako's working.

381
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,583
Yep!

382
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:56,250
Oh, yeah, I was wondering if
Keiichiro is off on Sundays?

383
00:15:56,333 --> 00:15:57,708
[MADOKA]
Hm?

384
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,791
[CHIHIRO] Do you think he
would come over for dinner?

385
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,958
My only wish in this
world is to cook dinner

386
00:16:02,041 --> 00:16:03,458
for Keiichiro one evening!

387
00:16:03,541 --> 00:16:05,291
That'd be a dream come true!

388
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:08,291
Why, you're like
Miyako's fairy god-parent.

389
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,208
Well, I'm sure Keiichiro
would come over

390
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:12,791
if we asked him, but your
chances would be better

391
00:16:12,875 --> 00:16:14,583
if pudding was on the menu.

392
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,750
Oh, so he prefers pudding?

393
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:18,250
Uh-- For real?

394
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:20,416
Yep! It's definitely
his favorite!

395
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,791
Isn't that adorable?

396
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,583
Yeah, sure. Adorable.

397
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:26,375
Anyway, we can't exactly
make pudding the main dish,

398
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,083
so I'll just put it
down for desert.

399
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,916
Let's see, he's also
a big fan of sushi.

400
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,458
But I'm not sure if Miyako
knows how to make it. Hm.

401
00:16:35,541 --> 00:16:38,833
[CHIHIRO] Hold up.
Now that I think about it...

402
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,791
I don't know what
kind of food he likes.

403
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,500
Even though I've cooked
for him every day!

404
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,875
[CHIHIRO]
Okay.

405
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:54,666
[MADOKA] Well, we're feeding
a small army today.

406
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,416
Yeah, I accidentally
made too much.

407
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,041
You don't have to
eat it all, though.

408
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,333
[MADOKA]
Sounds like a challenge!

409
00:17:00,416 --> 00:17:02,041
[CHIHIRO]
Heh! He totally bought it!

410
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:04,750
This is a surefire way
to find out what he likes.

411
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:09,541
[MADOKA]
I am so stuffed!

412
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,833
[CHIHIRO]
Uh-huh...

413
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,125
[MADOKA]
Hm.

414
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,750
You're emitting a scary aura.

415
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,333
You're seeing things!

416
00:17:17,416 --> 00:17:19,458
Anyway, which food
did you like the best?

417
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:20,458
Everything!

418
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,666
Nobody likes everything!

419
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:24,875
You've gotta have
some sort of preference!

420
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:27,291
[MADOKA]
What are my favorite foods?

421
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:28,875
Why are you so curious?

422
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:31,083
Well, I'm the one who
cooks for you after all,

423
00:17:31,166 --> 00:17:32,375
I should know.

424
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:34,458
That seems like
a valid enough point.

425
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,083
I like to eat
whatever my dear nephew

426
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,750
wants to make for me, of course!

427
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,250
What kind of answer is that?

428
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,541
[laughs nervously]

429
00:17:40,625 --> 00:17:41,916
If you won't tell me
your preferences,

430
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,000
then I'll just be forced
to make you nothing at all!

431
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:46,375
I really don't understand
your logic though.

432
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,708
Come on, I'm serious!

433
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,541
There must be
something you want!

434
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,375
Tell me and I'll
make it for you.

435
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:52,666
[MADOKA]
Hm.

436
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:55,416
[MADOKA]
Maybe a bento?

437
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,000
You're going back
to school tomorrow,

438
00:17:57,083 --> 00:17:59,833
so you can just make mine
when you make yours.

439
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:02,916
A bento lunch, okay.

440
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,500
[CHIHIRO sighs]

441
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,541
Wait, I still don't know
what food he likes!

442
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:17,291
[groans] Guess I'll
just pick something.

443
00:18:17,375 --> 00:18:18,416
I suppose I could use

444
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:20,375
some of the
leftovers from dinner.

445
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:22,333
Oh, and we already have
the stuff for meatloaf,

446
00:18:22,416 --> 00:18:25,291
so I could make meatballs--
or should I make fish?

447
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:26,458
If he were in kindergarten,

448
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,708
I could make those
octopus-shaped hotdogs.

449
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,416
[sighs] Maybe not.

450
00:18:33,833 --> 00:18:35,333
[CHIHIRO]
Rolled omelets.

451
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:41,541
[CHIHIRO] I've never made them,
but Mom was great at it.

452
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:45,541
[CHIYO]
What do you think?

453
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:46,958
Looks pretty awesome, huh?

454
00:18:47,041 --> 00:18:48,291
[CHIHIRO]
Whoa!

455
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:50,791
How did you get so good
at making rolled omelets?

456
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,000
Practice makes perfect, dear!

457
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,166
Oh, yeah?

458
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:54,458
Could you practice
making other food then?

459
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:55,958
How rude!

460
00:18:56,041 --> 00:18:58,125
If you chase two rabbits,
you won't catch either, Chihiro!

461
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,708
Sounds like an excuse.

462
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:01,791
Do you think you could
teach me to cook them maybe?

463
00:19:01,875 --> 00:19:03,125
[CHIYO]
No way!

464
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:05,208
Then I won't have anything
else to do around here!

465
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:07,708
I'm the official omelet
maker, so back off, buddy!

466
00:19:07,791 --> 00:19:09,791
[CHIHIRO]
You gave yourself a title?

467
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:13,958
Anyway, why decide to focus
on omelets of all things?

468
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,458
I'll tell you why.

469
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,500
[inaudible]

470
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,000
[grunts]

471
00:19:26,083 --> 00:19:27,458
[CHIHIRO growls]

472
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,291
You are such a creeper!

473
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,500
[MADOKA groans]

474
00:19:32,583 --> 00:19:35,083
[CHIHIRO] In the end,
I never learned how to do it.

475
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,958
I really wish I had tried
harder to get Mom to teach me.

476
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:41,416
It's too late now,
I'll just have to do my best.

477
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,541
Today I will become
the official omelet maker

478
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,958
in your place.

479
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,333
[MADOKA]
Good morning.

480
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,250
[CHIHIRO]
Morning.

481
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,666
[MADOKA]
Hm?

482
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,833
Is this my bento?

483
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:54,541
[CHIHIRO]
Yeah.

484
00:19:54,625 --> 00:19:57,208
Yay! You're the best!

485
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,041
[CHIHIRO]
Sorry.

486
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,208
[MADOKA]
Eh? About what?

487
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,875
I messed up today's lunch.

488
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:02,916
Oh?

489
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,125
[CHIHIRO]
Hey, don't open it now!

490
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:05,583
What are you doing?

491
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:10,416
[CHIHIRO]
I burned them.

492
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:11,958
I really wanted to
make them pretty

493
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,375
like mom's rolled omelets.

494
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:15,833
But I haven't practiced
enough, so they look nasty.

495
00:20:15,916 --> 00:20:17,833
[MADOKA munching]

496
00:20:17,916 --> 00:20:18,833
This is delicious, Chi.

497
00:20:18,916 --> 00:20:21,166
[CHIHIRO]
That's for lunch!

498
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,958
Doesn't it taste burnt?

499
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,041
[MADOKA] It reminds me;
when we were kids

500
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,958
we'd have picnics in the garden.

501
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,541
Huh?

502
00:20:28,625 --> 00:20:31,583
And sis would always volunteer
to make the bento for all of us.

503
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:34,916
But her lunches mostly consisted
of weirdly-shaped rice balls

504
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,666
and burnt rolled omelets.

505
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,416
[KEIICHIRO]
Um, what is this?

506
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,083
[MADOKA]
Is it supposed to be burned?

507
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:41,541
Excuse me?

508
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,125
[MADOKA]
Never mind the rice balls--

509
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,291
those rolled omelets
were a disaster.

510
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:47,208
She had used way too much sugar.

511
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,125
The flavor was all wrong,

512
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,791
[MADOKA]
But to tell you the truth...

513
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:56,333
In spite of all that,
I actually liked her cooking.

514
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,791
[gasps]

515
00:20:57,875 --> 00:20:59,875
[CHIHIRO] Anyway, why decide
to focus on omelets

516
00:20:59,958 --> 00:21:01,708
of all things?

517
00:21:01,791 --> 00:21:04,041
[CHIYO]
I'll tell you why.

518
00:21:04,125 --> 00:21:06,208
Because I was tired
of having my failures

519
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,791
always eaten as if
they were delicious.

520
00:21:10,041 --> 00:21:14,458
Chiyo, you must have learned
to make them quite nicely.

521
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,875
[CHIHIRO]
I'll practice, too.

522
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,333
Huh?

523
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,833
[CHIHIRO] I won't give up
until they look like Mom's!

524
00:21:20,916 --> 00:21:22,041
Wait and see!

525
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,333
They're gonna be better
than those failures

526
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,458
I made this morning!
You got that?

527
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,833
[MADOKA]
Sure.

528
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,375
Like it or not, you're going
to be my taste tester

529
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,083
for them, Madoka!

530
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:31,416
Uh--

531
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,916
[MADOKA]
Count me in.

532
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:40,625
[KEIICHIRO]
Moving on.

533
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:43,041
The next item on our list
I'd like to discuss is...

534
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,875
---Are you listening?
--[MADOKA] ...to... Bento...

535
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:46,166
--Master Madoka?
--[MADOKA] ...to... Bento...

536
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,875
--Earth to Madoka!
--[MADOKA] ...to... Bento...

537
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,125
Is it lunchtime already?

538
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:50,291
Time for my bento, right?

539
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,875
If that bento box
will get you to focus,

540
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,791
then sure, by all
means, bon appétit.

541
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,375
[MADOKA]
Yay! Time to eat!

542
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,500
By the way, if you
don't have plans,

543
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:01,583
then you should come eat
dinner with us on Sunday.

544
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:02,875
And there's going to be pudding!

545
00:22:02,958 --> 00:22:04,375
[KEIICHIRO]
Pudding?

546
00:22:04,458 --> 00:22:06,958
[CHIHIRO] Anyway. These are
all my failed attempts.

547
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,791
You guys go ahead and
help yourselves, okay?

548
00:22:10,875 --> 00:22:12,166
[HINO]
You told us to skip breakfast

549
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,791
for some burnt omelets?

550
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,041
[laughs]

551
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:52,416
[HINO] Hey, Komiya, I heard
the girls in our class

552
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,916
talking about you.
Know what they said?

553
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,500
[CHIHIRO]
Uh, no?

554
00:23:55,583 --> 00:23:57,416
[HINO] They all think that you'd
make a really great boy bride!

555
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:58,708
[CHIHIRO]
What? Boy bride?

556
00:23:58,791 --> 00:24:00,041
[HINO]
Right?

557
00:24:00,125 --> 00:24:01,416
Don't they know boys are
supposed to be the groom?

558
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,791
Anyway, I think I found
the perfect partner for you!

559
00:24:03,875 --> 00:24:05,125
[CHIHIRO]
Huh, who?

560
00:24:05,208 --> 00:24:06,500
[HINO] I'll give you a
little hint. Next time in

561
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:07,750
"Feed a Dog for Three Days

562
00:24:07,833 --> 00:24:09,916
and He Will Remember
It for Three Years,"

563
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,083
she may or may not make
a special appearance!

564
00:24:12,166 --> 00:24:13,458
[CHIHIRO]
Then why mention it at all?

565
00:24:13,541 --> 00:24:14,708
[HINO]
Ready to know who it is?

566
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,458
It's my little
sister, Hanako Hino!

567
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:18,583
[CHIHIRO]
Whoa, spoiler alert!

568
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:20,041
[HINO]
Until next time!
