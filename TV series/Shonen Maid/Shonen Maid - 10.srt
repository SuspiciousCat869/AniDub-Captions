Um. Sure, no problem.

Ah. Yes I am, like normal.

Well, well. Do you know
what you did wrong today?

Do you?

[MADOKA]
Yes.

00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:16,958
[CHIHIRO]
Of course you do.

27
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:19,375
Because you've been in trouble
for this before, right?

28

So why would you keep
repeating the same mistake?

29
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,166
[MADOKA] I just thought, you
know, if I wear this mask

30
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:25,958
then I wouldn't
sneeze and stuff.

31
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,333
I asked why you would
keep repeating

32
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:29,208
the same mistake, Madoka?

33
00:03:29,291 --> 00:03:31,625

I'm sorry.

Leave the rest to me.

Thanks for coming here
on your day off.

37

I appreciate it.

38
00:03:42,875 --> 00:03:44,458
Of course. Now tomorrow,

39

I'll be sure to stop by
the Cat Lover's Meet Up

40
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:48,000
and hopefully find
a home for these guys.

For cat lovers?

how it turns out.

[MADOKA] Aww. I thought
if I wore this mask

45
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:01,250
then everything would be okay.

46

Well surprise,
you thought wrong.

00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:04,166
Were you planning
on wearing that

the whole time
you were in here?

it was kind of a pain.

But I would have endured it
for my kitty harem!

Please don't call it that.

53
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,583
"Kitty harem" makes you
sound like a total weirdo.

it matters now anyway.

They were in your drawers?

stairs for the fur-babies.

That's not the cute factor
I was looking for.

80

I see. Well that explains
the sudden need

81
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,458
for deep cleaning.

[MADOKA] Yes, at least
it's only my room though.

All of my clothes,
sheets, and curtains

were covered with cat hair.

we had to wash everything.

Why are you out here
wearing only a blanket?

It's indecent!

Then hurry and give me
my clothes back already!

you can work fast, right?

When hanging up
large sheets like this,

101
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:02,583
they tend to dry faster
if you spread them out.

Okay!

Miyako, I'm sorry to
make you help like this.

No problem! It's such a perfect
day for hanging laundry anyway.

[CHIHIRO] I typically
use the dryer,

109
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,541
but I just love the way
laundry smells after

it has dried in the
fresh air, you know?

Yeah, me too!

how much of that
fabric do you have?

119

I actually bought
the entire bolt! Mhm!

Talk about excessive.

Considering his
huge love of cats,

its prob'ly not enough fabric!

you so mean to me?

Don't get the wrong idea.

137
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,708
I didn't buy these, you know!

138
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,583
Miyako gave them all to me!

139
00:07:46,666 --> 00:07:49,958
Oh. So that's what was
in the box that arrived earlier.

140
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:52,333
Correct. You know,
I do love cats,

141
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:53,958
but a man my age
really shouldn't be

playing with stuffed animals.
But, they were a gift!

143
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,041
It would be rude not to!

144
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,166
I simply must
play with them, you see?

[CHIHIRO] Hi Hana!
Hello Mrs. Hino!

163
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:46,416
How are you guys?

164
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,000
[HANAKO]
Yay!

165
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,291
[chuckles]

166
00:08:49,375 --> 00:08:51,208
Good to see you! And
thank you for the macarons

167
00:08:51,291 --> 00:08:52,750
you made us all for White Day.

168
00:08:52,833 --> 00:08:54,541
Those were some
delicious cookies!

169
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:56,125
Did you really
make them yourself?

170
00:08:56,208 --> 00:08:57,583
Uh, yes!

171
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:58,958
Wow, that's impressive!

172
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:02,083

[HINO'S MOM] Oh yeah.
Speaking of homemade things,

175
00:09:05,875 --> 00:09:07,708
Memorial Week is coming up.

176
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:08,958
I'm going to make
a big batch

177
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,625
of botamochi for Higan.

178
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:13,958
I'd be happy to set some aside
for you, if you want.

179
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,375
Are you sure?

180
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,541
Mommy said I can
be the taste tester.

181
00:09:17,625 --> 00:09:18,708
They're yummy!

182
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:19,708
Don't be a stranger.

We're always here
if you need us.

Thank you,
I appreciate it.

185
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,875
[CHIHIRO] Wow. Higan really
snuck up on me.

186
00:09:36,958 --> 00:09:40,125
It has been a long time
since I visited Mom's grave.

187
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:43,000
It's probably in need
of a good cleaning.

188
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:48,291
Okay so, I'll need botamochi,
prob'ly incense.

189
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,458
What else? Oh, flowers!

What a surprise.

00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,125
How have you been?

00:10:28,208 --> 00:10:31,125
Uh... Fine, I suppose.

[KAZUSA]
Well, you see,

197
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:38,000
the poor thing looked
positively famished.

198
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,416
I only put the food out
in case the cat was hungry,

199
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,500
not because I wanted to pet it.

200
00:10:42,583 --> 00:10:45,625
Yeah, right, of course.
That's super reasonable.

201
00:10:47,375 --> 00:10:49,083
So are you
running errands today?

202
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:52,333
Yep. There was a really
awesome sale on vegetables.

This cabbage was a steal!

You're like a

Uuh...

206
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,833
I have a couple of
errands to run as well.

207
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:04,041
There's a candy store nearby,
and it's one of my favorites.

I need to go before Higan.

Oh. For botamochi?

210
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,416
That's right.

211
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:15,166
I've been thinking and
I wonder if it's hard to make.

212
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,750
Ah. So, do you
normally buy it?

213
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,250
Kinda. We used to get
botamochi from the store,

214
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:22,541
but I just learned to bake,

215
00:11:22,625 --> 00:11:24,291
and even though
I'm not all that great,

216
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:27,666
I was thinking of making
my own this year.

217
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,166
I thought it would be
a better offering

218
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:32,000
if I prepared them
myself, you know?

219

[KAZUSA]
Mmm. Give it a shot.

220

You'll never know until
you at least try, right?

221
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,375
Besides,
all mothers cherish gifts

you're all set then.

it went by quickly

[MADOKA] You know what I've
always wondered about?

252
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:04,166
Why half-pounding sticky rice
is called "half-killing."

253
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,125
Why do you care?

254
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:08,541
It sounds so violent.
Know what I mean?

255
00:13:08,625 --> 00:13:09,875
I don't want to
half-kill anything,

256
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,916
much less this
poor defenseless rice.

257
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,250
What'd it ever do to me?

258
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:15,416
Uh yeah. Just don't
overdo it, okay?

259
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,583
Fine.

00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,208

probably wondering

261
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:24,250
what's going to happen
to you after this.

00:16:57,250 --> 00:16:58,750
[MADOKA]
I'm sorry.

305
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,291
Well, I don't really
remember him,

306

so I can't be sad about it.

I guess.

308
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,625
[CHIHIRO] Mom did try to
show me some pictures of him,

309
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,250
but he was either
always hiding his face

310
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,166
or the photo was
like, super blurry.

311
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:12,458
It was pointless.

are just camera shy!

313

That's true. But Mom sure
did talk about him a lot.

314
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:22,666
[CHIYO] Your dad was all alone,
and he only wanted one thing.

315
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,125
He wanted a family of his own.

316
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:33,625
Except then he died
not long after I was born.

00:17:33,708 --> 00:17:37,208
[MADOKA] I wonder what Chi
looked like as a baby.

318
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:38,916
I bet you were adorable.

319
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:41,916
Can you imagine all
the frilly baby clothes?

320
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,083
Oh, please stop.

321
00:17:44,166 --> 00:17:46,750
Know what I think?
Your dad must have been happy.

322
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:48,958
I mean, he did have you guys.

323
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,666
I don't know. To be honest,

324
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:54,125
I can't say I think
of him that often.

325
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:55,666
Is that bad?

326
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,708
[MADOKA] No. I mean,
I don't remember anything

327
00:17:57,791 --> 00:18:00,791
from when I was a baby either.

328
00:18:00,875 --> 00:18:05,416
But to your dad, you must
have meant the world.

329
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:10,791
After all, that's what
it's like to be family.

330
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:15,083
Maybe you're right.

331
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,333
[MADOKA] Well Chi, I guess
now you belong to me.

332
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,416
I'm gonna keep you
forever and ever!

333
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:23,416
Wha-- Hey, I'm not a pet!

334
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:24,958
I'm kidding.
If I brag too much,

335
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,875
sis might come back
and haunt me!

336
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:28,166
Sure.

337
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,000
I'm sorry.

338
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:43,500
[CHIHIRO]
Dear Mom and Dad,

339
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:45,083
this is my life now.

340
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,166
I'm happy that
you're together again.

341
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:50,875
At least you won't be lonely,
and I'm not either.

342
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:03,666
Here, this one's yours.

343
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,083
[MADOKA] Hey, Chi? Speaking
of photos and stuff,

344
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,791
do you have a baby album?

345
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:09,208
[CHIHIRO] You're not
allowed to see it.

346
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:11,791
Aw, if I showed you a
really embarrassing picture

347
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:14,125
of Keiichiro, then maybe
could I look at it?

348
00:19:14,208 --> 00:19:17,041
[CHIHIRO]
And you call <i>him</i> evil.

349
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:21,041
Shoot, I forgot the bucket.
Be right back!

350
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:43,125
[CHIHIRO]
It's her.

351
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:55,708
Oh. Well hello
again, Chihiro.

352
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:59,750
You did a wonderful job
taking care of the grave.

353
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,666
This is a surprise.

354
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:07,916
It's not often I see you
visiting someone's grave

355
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,125
so obediently, Madoka.

356
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:12,666
Perhaps this means
you've matured a bit.

357
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,541
It was worth
letting you leave, then.

358
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,000
What do you think
you're doing here?

359
00:20:16,083 --> 00:20:18,916
What do you want?

360
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,250
Pardon me, I didn't realize
it was such a crime

361
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:24,458
for a mother to visit
her daughter's grave.

362
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,416
Your daughter?

363
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,291
[KAZUSA] Though we've
talked so often Chihiro,

364
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:32,125
I never properly
introduced myself.

365
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,791
I'm Kazusa Takatori.

366
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:38,541
Your mother was my daughter,
making me your grandmother.

367
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,375
[KAZUSA]
Oh dear.

368
00:20:50,458 --> 00:20:54,875
It wasn't ever my intention
to deceive you.

369
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:58,750
I'm so sorry for
not telling you sooner.

370
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:14,916
[crossing gate dings]

371
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,708
Your mother?

372
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,583
My mother. I wonder
what she's thinking.

373
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,208
You know, she'd been
meeting with Chi

374
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,291
without ever telling him
who she was?

375
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,000
[KEIICHIRO]
You don't say?

376
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:30,416
Was it you?
Did you tell her?

377
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,416
Where Chiyo's grave was.

378
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,250
She asked me and of course
I'm obliged to answer.

379
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:40,250
I guess so. It's not
as if I can blame you.

380
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:44,166
I can't believe her.
The sheer audacity.

381
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:47,375
She's only trying
to get on his good side.

382
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:51,791
[MADOKA] After all, that's what
it's like to be family.

383
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:56,666
Then again, look at me.
I'm just as bad.

384
00:21:59,916 --> 00:22:02,750
[CHIHIRO] It's strange.
I thought for sure that if

385
00:22:02,833 --> 00:22:04,625
I ever met anyone
from the main family

386
00:22:04,708 --> 00:22:07,416
I'd be angrier.

387
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:19,500
Hey, Mom.
I met Grandma today.

388
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:53,291
[MADOKA] Chihiro, I want to
thank you for everything.

389
00:23:53,375 --> 00:23:55,125
[CHIHIRO]
That sounds weirdly formal.

390
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:56,583
[MADOKA] Yes, I know.
It feels like

391
00:23:56,666 --> 00:23:58,416
this might be
goodbye, though.

392
00:23:58,500 --> 00:23:59,625
[CHIHIRO]
Madoka.

393
00:23:59,708 --> 00:24:01,000
[MADOKA] Then again,
it's only a feeling,

394
00:24:01,083 --> 00:24:02,458
maybe it won't come true.

395
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:03,958
[CHIHIRO]
Okay!

396
00:24:04,041 --> 00:24:05,625
[MADOKA] Wait, you could act
a little more sad about it!

397
00:24:05,708 --> 00:24:07,916
[CHIHIRO] The next episode
is "Boys, Be Ambitious"!

398
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,750
Who knows what is going
to happen to all of us?

399
00:24:09,833 --> 00:24:11,291
How will things end up?

400
00:24:11,375 --> 00:24:14,208
[MADOKA] Stop! You're making it
sound like it's really over!

401
00:24:14,291 --> 00:24:15,458
[CHIHIRO]
Don't forget to watch!

402
00:24:15,541 --> 00:24:17,791
[MADOKA] And so,
the boy becomes a man.

403
00:24:17,875 --> 00:24:19,583
Just kidding!
