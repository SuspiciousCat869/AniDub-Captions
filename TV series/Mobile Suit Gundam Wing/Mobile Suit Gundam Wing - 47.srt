[OPENING THEME]

2
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
The Heroine of the Battlefield

3
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,070
the Romefeller Foundation's
enforced rule has resulted

4
00:01:55,070 --> 00:01:57,500
in disputes popping up all
over the world.

5
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,250
Our country has declared
itself a peaceful nation

6
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:02,380
and we've been trying to
avoid resistance.

7
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:06,300
Sure, we'd be guaranteed peace
if we allowed them
to control us!

8
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,820
But you couldn't really call
that true peace!

9
00:02:08,980 --> 00:02:11,690
It'd simply be a method of
oppression that would lead

10
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:14,200
to a new despotic rule and
more disputes, right??

11
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:17,800
I certainly hope we're making
the right decisions.

12
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:21,280
Over the ages, the world has
had many countries,

13
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,980
many races, and many
ways of thinking.

14
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,300
Perhaps we should accept the
fact that a number

15
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,860
of the disputes in the past
were unavoidable.

16
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:31,420
[RELENA:] Freedom is a right
given to all people.

17
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:36,180
At the same time, we must
realize that people cannot be
given complete freedom.

18
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:40,940
What we need in order to attain
harmony is to learn to be
thoughtful toward others.

19
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,220
A peaceful future doesn't
lie in fighting,

20
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,900
it's our job to learn from our
past and use that experience to

21
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:48,900
build a new and correct future.

22
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:53,880
I was afraid that our nation
alone couldn't act against the
Romefeller Foundation.

23
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:57,610
So was I, but the Sanc Kingdom
is a country where the idea

24
00:02:57,610 --> 00:03:01,880
of total pacifism is well rooted
in the teachings of the
Peacecraft family.

25
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:04,020
It's presence is a
strong support.

26
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,060
I'm fully aware that my manners
and speech and behavior seem
impolite to you,

27
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,140
despite the fact that I'm merely
following my father's teachings.

28
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:17,340
But it's my sincere hope that
more countries and more people
can one day attain true peace.

29
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,960
To that end, I ask for
your assistance.

30
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:22,960
[APPLAUSE]

31
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:36,620
[SOLDIER:] The discussions
seemed to go smoothly.

32
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:40,480
It's not as if we're watching
over every action you people
take or anything.

33
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,220
Just that your meeting
ended so soon.

34
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:47,440
We're resolute in our intentions
and that's probably

35
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,700
why the meeting did not
take us very long.

36
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:54,160
[SOLDIER:] We'll be on our way
since we're not needed. We're
ruining the view.

37
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,740
[RELENA:] We don't necessarily
dislike the
Romefeller Foundation,

38
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:00,880
We'd just like for you to hurry
up and rectify your mistakes.

39
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:04,200
And do it before a great deal of
people lose their lives.

40
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:15,600
Come in Count Townsend, we have
found two space suits.

41
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,280
It appears that it was just two
of them that landed here.

42
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,380
[TOWNSEND:] Roger. I don't see
any particular reason
to be cautious.

43
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:23,440
You may return.
‐ [SOLDIER:] Yes sir

44
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,000
The space colonies and the
Romefeller Foundation
have joined forces,

45
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,700
the Gundam pilots'
missions are over.

46
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,860
We have our orders to execute
the Gundam pilots.

47
00:04:35,020 --> 00:04:36,940
Executing them would be easy.

48
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,040
Although our country is under
the Romefeller
Foundation's rule,

49
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,600
I would rather hold off
getting rid of them yet.

50
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,640
[BARKING DOGS]

51
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,280
You're not really big on
animals Quatre?

52
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,040
No... I love them.

53
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:13,560
Then play with the dogs. It
seems they'd rather play
with you anyway.

54
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:17,960
[HEERO:] Animals have a natural
ability to sense
kindness in people.

55
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,840
[QUATRE:] Is kindness
necessary in a war?

56
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,200
No it isn't, not while you're
fighting at least.

57
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,820
But kindness is something you
probably need the
rest of the time.

58
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:30,940
This isn't the time to
be fighting now.

59
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,300
[QUATRE LAUGHING]
‐[BARKING DOGS]

60
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,160
Thank you for the meal.

61
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:47,750
I'm sorry to trouble you,
especially considering

62
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,600
there are orders out
to execute us

63
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:54,960
Fortunately the headquarters
contacted us and will be picking
up you Gundam pilots.

64
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,960
I'm quite glad since it means I
won't have to carry out
the orders myself.

65
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:02,920
It still means I'll be handing
you over to them when
the time comes.

66
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,160
We can't trouble you more than
we have. You're just
doing your job.

67
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,660
You're gonna surrender
without a fight?

68
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:16,460
We don't know what we'll do when
the time comes, but we're not
going to die without
good reason.

69
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,320
You guys are certainly strong.

70
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:21,580
We're involved in the control
policies of the
Romefeller Foundation

71
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:23,660
but we definitely have our
share of doubts.

72
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,780
Getting involved was the only
choice we had to avoid
futile battle.

73
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:31,240
You made the correct decision in
order to protect the lives
of your people.

74
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:34,260
I believe that's the same
decision the people in
our home made.

75
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:37,540
As far as the Romefeller
Foundation is concerned,

76
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:40,820
we Gundam pilots are nothing but
a mere obstruction to them.

77
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:46,040
Anyone who's after our lives is
an enemy. We have to fight if
we want to survive.

78
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:52,040
Right now that's the one and
only thing that we can and must
must carry out. It's
that simple.

79
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,520
If you don't want to die,
that is.

80
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:02,240
[PILOT:] Attention, surrender
your carrier at once.

81
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:04,000
We have orders to
shoot you down.

82
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
[PILOT:] I repeat,
surrender at once.

83
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,960
The sea's got to be cold at
a latitude of 50.

84
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,940
But still, I can't simply give
up the craft to OZ.

85
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:37,440
[MUTTERING]

86
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:54,000
There it is.

87
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,460
Get a move on!

88
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,840
Sally Po, you just be thankful
you got a fireplace.

89
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:16,080
The new OZ is a
warmhearted organization.

90
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,180
You're only treating me like a
special guest until you confirm

91
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,760
what's in the carrier I suppose.

92
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:24,670
We've been advised to watch out
for rebels who got involved

93
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,980
with the Gundam pilots once they
came out in the open.

94
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,200
We didn't actually expect to get
our hands on a Gundam though.

95
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,300
So it's true that the Gundam
Pilots have returned to Earth.

96
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,120
I've got to make sure I
deliver it to them.

97
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:41,920
But more and more nations are
starting to take sides
with Romefeller,

98
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,320
it'll be more difficult for
me to do anything.

99
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,750
The metal detector won't be able
to pick up the Gundam,

100
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,440
but it will pick up the carrier,
so that's what
you've gotta find.

101
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,440
[PILOT:] Yes sir!

102
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,500
[EXPLOSIONS]

103
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,200
What's wrong?

104
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:03,260
Enemies!!

105
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:09,920
Who are you?

106
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,440
I want the truth from you. Was
that the real thing you sank?

107
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,920
I might just tell a lie so
that you'll free me.

108
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:20,740
I want to retaliate against
Romefeller so I need the Gundam.

109
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,570
[NOIN:] And you're fighting
the same enemy, so decide

110
00:09:23,570 --> 00:09:25,580
for yourself whether or not
you want to negotiate.

111
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:30,580
Looks like my time's run out.
‐ Then let's go.

112
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:54,300
So it was real then, that's why
the enemy caught on so fast.

113
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:59,920
It's the one OZ referred to as
01. You said you wanted the
Gundam to save yourselves.

114
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,260
What country are you from?

115
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:03,200
I can't tell you quite yet.

116
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll just say that the nation's
retaliating against the
Romefeller Foundation

117
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,160
and it could be
attacked anytime.

118
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,860
[NOIN:] The ruler of the nation
is an individual who's
indispensable

119
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:17,000
for the future. And is capable
of bringing true peace
to this world.

120
00:10:17,940 --> 00:10:21,620
Do you expect to win against the
Romefeller Foundation with
just the Gundams?

121
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,000
I'm confident in it's pilot.
He'd defeat
Romefeller's ambitions.

122
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:43,520
As acquaintences of the Gundam
pilots, you and I have a habit
of overdoing things a bit.

123
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,080
There's a risk in depending on
them too much. But at the moment
I do want their help.

124
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:51,640
Nobody wants to get
involved in wars.

125
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,960
But those people who have the
ability to fight, should fight.

126
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:56,960
Or at least that's what I
think is true.

127
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:59,140
I'm reluctant to use the
word righteous,

128
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:02,100
but I really do think that word
suits those kids well.

129
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,480
Calling them righteous might
really be a sad thing,

130
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,540
since it forces them to be
seen as modern heroes.

131
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:14,120
I want to follow them. If I do,
it's unlikely that I'll be
taking a wrong path.

132
00:11:34,656 --> 00:11:37,676
The plans to wipe out the
Gundams are progressing
in two places.

133
00:11:37,676 --> 00:11:39,036
One is obviously here.

134
00:11:40,056 --> 00:11:42,976
Could the other have to do with
the Gundam you left behind?

135
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:46,676
I think that might be.
They call it 01.

136
00:11:47,196 --> 00:11:49,336
[QUATRE:] Heero, have you heard
of the Sanc Kingdom?

137
00:11:49,616 --> 00:11:54,636
It comes up several times in the
Romefeller Foundation's data as
a problematic nation.

138
00:11:55,636 --> 00:11:57,236
The Sanc Kingdom.

139
00:11:58,316 --> 00:12:02,356
They're covering their tracks
but they're quite
interested in finding 01.

140
00:12:02,956 --> 00:12:08,756
And also it's pilot. Wouldn't
you like to visit? I'm sure we
could be of some help to them.

141
00:12:17,816 --> 00:12:22,476
That's a good boy. These two
dogs are the only ones
guarding us right now.

142
00:12:22,736 --> 00:12:24,476
They're saying we should leave.

143
00:12:24,696 --> 00:12:28,496
This nation isn't looking for
any battles but we're
like time bombs

144
00:12:28,496 --> 00:12:29,856
and we'll cause them trouble.

145
00:12:30,096 --> 00:12:34,096
The commander here has a weak
point to boot. It's
his kindness.

146
00:12:34,776 --> 00:12:36,436
Let's get going, now.

147
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,116
Sure thing.

148
00:12:52,596 --> 00:12:54,496
I'm getting something
headed our way.

149
00:12:54,636 --> 00:12:57,356
Any word from Count Townsend
yet?
‐Nothing!

150
00:12:57,356 --> 00:12:59,436
Check with him at once.
‐Sir!

151
00:12:59,556 --> 00:13:02,096
What? They're heading straight
for Romefeller's forces?

152
00:13:02,096 --> 00:13:03,636
Why wouldn't they be escaping??

153
00:13:03,956 --> 00:13:06,176
We have an urgent message from
those forces demanding

154
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:07,736
information on the
approaching craft.

155
00:13:07,736 --> 00:13:10,136
Count Townsend sir! This
was left behind.

156
00:13:10,396 --> 00:13:12,056
By the Gundam pilots?

157
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:13,736
What is it sir?

158
00:13:13,916 --> 00:13:16,496
Please inform them at once
that we've escaped.

159
00:13:16,496 --> 00:13:20,736
We cannot afford to cause you
any more trouble than we
already have that is.

160
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:26,336
Thank you Count Townsend, we'd
be wiser to just run away but we
always end up fighting.

161
00:13:26,636 --> 00:13:30,896
Wherever I go it's the same
because fighting is
all I can do.

162
00:13:32,896 --> 00:13:34,356
I feel sorry for them.

163
00:13:47,596 --> 00:13:49,636
<i>[SOLDIER:] Enemy attack,</i>
<i>enemy attack!!</i>

164
00:13:55,616 --> 00:13:57,456
It's being raised. Let's go.

165
00:13:57,456 --> 00:13:58,976
Roger. See you.

166
00:14:01,516 --> 00:14:03,616
Launching torpedoes at enemy.

167
00:14:12,696 --> 00:14:14,796
[SUB PILOT:] What's this?
An attack??

168
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:16,316
[YELLING]

169
00:14:35,176 --> 00:14:37,156
This is nuts, but it's
the only way!

170
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:38,576
I knew it would be.

171
00:14:41,596 --> 00:14:44,976
<i>[NOIN:] I want them, for the</i>
<i>sake of the Sanc Kingdom.</i>

172
00:14:54,456 --> 00:14:56,136
[EXPLOSION]

173
00:15:02,016 --> 00:15:03,216
[GUNSHOTS]

174
00:15:05,116 --> 00:15:07,136
Hands up! And no funny stuff.

175
00:15:07,356 --> 00:15:11,396
[QUATRE:] Advise the other ships
as well. I don't want to make
things worse than they are.

176
00:15:15,236 --> 00:15:20,036
You better do what my partner
tells you. If it was me I would
have already opened fire.

177
00:15:20,216 --> 00:15:25,336
In reality, I just want you to
leave us alone, but I figure
you won't do that.

178
00:15:34,276 --> 00:15:36,836
Heero, where should
we head to now?

179
00:15:36,836 --> 00:15:39,196
There isn't any place that I
really want to go.

180
00:15:41,296 --> 00:15:43,896
There are lots of kind people
right here on the Earth,

181
00:15:43,896 --> 00:15:46,816
but we'd be causing them a
great deal of trouble

182
00:15:47,036 --> 00:15:49,516
by doing nothing more than
just meeting them.

183
00:15:49,776 --> 00:15:52,556
There is no place for us to go,
is there?

184
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:56,076
Quatre. It's because you're
trying to forget the battle.

185
00:15:56,876 --> 00:15:59,916
As long as Earth is a war zone,
I'm gonna fight.

186
00:16:00,396 --> 00:16:02,636
You have no choice but
to fight either.

187
00:16:03,356 --> 00:16:06,036
That's because we're both
Gundam pilots.

188
00:16:07,316 --> 00:16:10,516
[HEERO:] The battlefield is the
only place we're
allowed to live.

189
00:16:10,696 --> 00:16:14,256
For us, I guess the meaning of
life lies in surviving battles.

190
00:16:23,256 --> 00:16:26,816
<i>Sally here. The surface is under</i>
<i>control. How are things?</i>

191
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,916
It's like meeting a
long lost friend.

192
00:16:29,716 --> 00:16:31,616
[PO:] Use it to protect
your country.

193
00:16:32,656 --> 00:16:34,116
[NOIN:] I can't
thank you enough.

194
00:16:34,556 --> 00:16:38,596
My name is Lucrezia Noin,
and the country I'm serving is‐

195
00:16:38,596 --> 00:16:40,096
[PO:] Noin, it's okay.

196
00:16:40,576 --> 00:16:44,896
You don't have to tell me where
you're from. I trust your
intentions are genuine.

197
00:16:45,696 --> 00:16:49,956
I'm just honored to help a
nation that's trying to
oppose Romefeller.

198
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,496
Thanks Sally.

199
00:16:51,496 --> 00:16:53,956
I am going to go ahead and look
for another Gundam.

200
00:16:54,076 --> 00:16:56,796
If you hear about one, I would
more than welcome your help.

201
00:16:56,796 --> 00:17:00,436
It would be great if we had 2 or
3 Gundam pilots with us by then.

202
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:04,736
You can count on my help. It'll
give me a good chance to
earn your trust.

203
00:17:05,516 --> 00:17:09,396
I give you my word, in the name
of God, and our nation.

204
00:17:15,836 --> 00:17:18,256
[HONKING HORN]

205
00:17:40,576 --> 00:17:44,156
The guards that were here for
the Peace Nations
Assembly are leaving.

206
00:17:48,236 --> 00:17:50,356
[DOROTHY:] So I rushed
here for nothing.

207
00:17:53,456 --> 00:17:57,816
And I was positive they'd take
this opportunity to invade the
Sanc Kingdom too.

208
00:17:58,136 --> 00:18:00,676
Well, the mobile dolls just
won't do the job.

209
00:18:01,116 --> 00:18:03,416
There's no way those dinky
things have a chance

210
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,976
against the knights protecting
their precious queen.

211
00:18:06,536 --> 00:18:10,476
[PAGAN:] Miss Relena, are you
all right with that new student
arriving here today?

212
00:18:10,796 --> 00:18:12,316
Why do you ask Pagan?

213
00:18:12,476 --> 00:18:14,976
I heard she is a blood
relative of Duke Dermail,

214
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:17,436
the central figure of the
Romefeller Foundation.

215
00:18:17,816 --> 00:18:21,116
I know I mustn't make
assumptions, but given
that the Foundation

216
00:18:21,116 --> 00:18:23,676
doesn't think highly of the Sanc
Kingdom's pacifism,

217
00:18:23,676 --> 00:18:25,996
I can't help but think it's
some sort of trick.

218
00:18:26,276 --> 00:18:29,316
The Romefeller Foundation has
said they wish to learn more

219
00:18:29,316 --> 00:18:32,316
about educational policies on
building a peaceful nation.

220
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:36,616
That's why they told us they
wanted to send a student to
our Kingdom here.

221
00:18:36,876 --> 00:18:38,716
There's nothing to worry about.

222
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:42,816
[PAGAN:] I have problems
believing everything the
Foundation says.

223
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,796
Doubting people won't
get you anywhere.

224
00:18:45,876 --> 00:18:49,516
Besides, there's nothing
mistaken in what
we're doing here.

225
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:54,056
I think this would be a great
opportunity to make them
understand that.

226
00:18:58,936 --> 00:19:04,416
I'm Relena Peacecraft, Director
of this institution. Welcome
to the Sanc Kingdom.

227
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:08,036
Oh I wasn't aware that the
Princess of the Sanc Kingdom

228
00:19:08,036 --> 00:19:10,596
was also the Director of
the institution.

229
00:19:10,796 --> 00:19:15,016
Once again, my name is Dorothy
Catalonia. It is an
honor to meet you.

230
00:19:15,696 --> 00:19:18,036
I'm still, powerless to do
anything on my own.

231
00:19:18,296 --> 00:19:21,686
I'm learning the peace policies
that my father advocated,

232
00:19:21,686 --> 00:19:23,716
just the same as
everyone else is.

233
00:19:24,216 --> 00:19:28,396
As you're aware, I've come here
on behalf of the
Romefeller Foundation.

234
00:19:28,536 --> 00:19:32,256
The Foundation is surrounded
with weapons in this
war torn world.

235
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:36,376
I have a great interest in the
policies of the Sanc Kingdom,

236
00:19:36,496 --> 00:19:40,876
especially what you do if these
forces decide to
invade the country.

237
00:19:42,296 --> 00:19:45,596
This beautiful scenery would
disappear in an instant.

238
00:19:46,676 --> 00:19:50,036
And the hearts that cherish this
beauty would also be lost.

239
00:19:50,876 --> 00:19:53,776
Nobody in their right mind would
want to just hand
over the kingdom

240
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:57,996
to such foolish barbarians so I
wonder what you'd do
in that case.

241
00:19:58,176 --> 00:20:01,476
I don't believe there are any
foolish people living
in this world.

242
00:20:01,556 --> 00:20:04,716
People can reach an
understanding by
talking things over

243
00:20:04,716 --> 00:20:08,216
and I believe that discussions
will bring peace to all people.

244
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:14,076
Miss Relena, I'm a foolish
person myself, I love wars,
I really do.

245
00:20:14,676 --> 00:20:18,436
I guess I would only be a
nuisance by staying in
this country.

246
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:21,146
Not at all, the main objective
of the Sanc Kingdom

247
00:20:21,146 --> 00:20:24,196
is to provide a place where
these types of
discussions can be held.

248
00:20:24,396 --> 00:20:27,736
I look forward to more talks
like this with you,
Miss Dorothy.

249
00:20:29,116 --> 00:20:33,216
How very kind of you, but just
call me Dorothy, Miss Relena.

250
00:20:33,476 --> 00:20:36,456
And you are welcome to call me
Relena. ‐ I couldn't!

251
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:40,276
You're the heroine of our
times Miss Relena!

252
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:43,056
I myself feel a great
admiration for you!

253
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:51,116
Dorothy Catalonia. She's the
same age as Miss Relena.

254
00:20:51,116 --> 00:20:55,496
I expected her to be brainwashed
by Romefeller's
manipulative ways

255
00:20:55,496 --> 00:20:57,736
but that does not seem
to be the case.

256
00:20:58,616 --> 00:21:01,736
But we must be cautious. Keep
a close eye on her.

257
00:21:01,876 --> 00:21:07,736
I even had this ready just in
case, but it seems Dorothy is a
tougher person than I thought.

258
00:21:08,236 --> 00:21:09,216
What do you mean?

259
00:21:10,336 --> 00:21:14,536
From what I can gather Miss
Dorothy truly gets
enjoyment out of battles.

260
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:18,096
At this important time, when
Miss Relena is
rejecting battles,

261
00:21:18,096 --> 00:21:22,336
I'm worried that Dorothy's
presence could be too
distracting to Miss Relena.

262
00:21:22,516 --> 00:21:27,816
Relena's thoughts are
commendable. She knows that her
actions are highly risky today,

263
00:21:27,996 --> 00:21:31,596
our mission is to protect Relena
as well as her actions.

264
00:21:32,136 --> 00:21:34,576
Even if that means
getting some weapons?

265
00:21:34,576 --> 00:21:37,556
That's right. Our former king
was assassinated,

266
00:21:37,556 --> 00:21:40,736
and we can't risk letting the
same thing happen to Relena.

267
00:21:41,076 --> 00:21:43,356
Right now we're confronted by
a part of history

268
00:21:43,356 --> 00:21:45,936
that could easily, but must
not be repeated.

269
00:22:00,996 --> 00:22:04,876
I'll protect Relena, even if it
means using foul play,

270
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:07,896
I'll live my life in the
shadows of this kingdom.

271
00:22:16,256 --> 00:22:18,236
Hurry up and start a war!

272
00:22:28,996 --> 00:22:34,176
[ENDING THEME]

273
00:23:40,236 --> 00:23:45,976
Romefeller's military power
continues to grow as they
finally attack areas of dispute.

274
00:23:46,556 --> 00:23:50,016
Heero recklessly participates in
the battle as a mercenary

275
00:23:50,016 --> 00:23:52,596
of the Treize Faction's
retaliating troops.

276
00:23:52,596 --> 00:23:56,576
Quatre begins doubting that he
can find all answers
within battles.

277
00:23:56,716 --> 00:24:00,096
Then, he learns of a nation
promoting total pacifism.

278
00:24:00,096 --> 00:24:04,976
