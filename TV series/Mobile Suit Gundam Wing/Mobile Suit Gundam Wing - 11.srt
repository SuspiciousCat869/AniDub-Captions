Their target is
obviously this base!

Must be the new models.

Do you think that they're
all mobile dolls?

14
00:02:20,534 --> 00:02:24,314
Probably. They're sending a very
small number to try and
crush this base.

Tradition is a history.

40

It's the history of caring,
built by deep true
feelings of people.

I do think that fighting in

beautiful.

But at the same time I'd like

[TREIZE:] over the lost souls by
appealing to you to recognize
how priceless man's life is.

<i>the idea of battles which</i>
<i>employed mobile dolls</i>

<i>and made human presence</i>

<i>Romefeller tried to</i>

48

<i>resolve the situation by</i>
<i>confining Treize.</i>

49
00:05:16,514 --> 00:05:20,154
<i>This resulted in encouraging a</i>
<i>group of OZ soldiers,</i>

50

<i>who also disagreed with the</i>
<i>introduction of mobile dolls,</i>

<i>to unite. They called</i>
<i>themselves, the Treize Faction,</i>

Scrapping it will be
quite simple.

103

But there's one piece of
data I'd like first.

104
00:08:56,854 --> 00:09:01,174
The data on the pilots that can
fight at the same level as
those mobile dolls.

[MASTER O:] We're checking how
the cockpit system of Wing Zero

infuences the

109
00:09:21,374 --> 00:09:24,074
[INSTRUCTOR H:] There's no
problem, that system
is flawless.

110
00:09:24,494 --> 00:09:28,914
A decision was made by the
Romefeller Foundation to confine
Treize Khushrenada.

111
00:09:29,334 --> 00:09:33,094
And as a result, Oz's forces
have split into two factions.

112
00:09:33,434 --> 00:09:35,294
Lady Une has been shot.

113
00:09:36,014 --> 00:09:39,254
It hasn't been confirmed whether
she is dead or alive,

114
00:09:39,254 --> 00:09:42,854
but she's regarded as a offender
by the Romefeller
Foundation now.

115
00:09:42,854 --> 00:09:46,494
The other two pilots; Duo
Maxwell and Wu Fei Chang,

116
00:09:46,494 --> 00:09:48,694
escaped during Oz's
internal unrest.

117
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:53,054
However both of their Gundams
are still only about
80% complete.

118
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:56,214
Only minor adjustments are
needed to complete them.

119
00:09:56,894 --> 00:10:01,234
With a little time, those pilots
should be able to finish the
Gundam on their own.

120
00:10:03,754 --> 00:10:05,254
How about Trowa Barton?

121
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:07,814
[QUATRE:] Huh?

122
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:11,094
He's been Missing in action
since the Vayeate was destroyed.

123
00:10:11,554 --> 00:10:12,554
Probably dead.

124
00:10:13,214 --> 00:10:15,654
The possibility of his
surviving is quite low.

125
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:19,774
Our force will be diminished but
there isn't anything we
can do about that.

126
00:10:20,354 --> 00:10:22,234
And that's the present
situation we're in.

127
00:10:22,734 --> 00:10:24,214
Did you get all that Heero?

128
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:25,734
[HEERO:] Got it.

129
00:10:26,234 --> 00:10:30,134
[PROFESSOR G:] Now, I'll explain
the situation with the Treize
Faction on this base.

130
00:10:30,874 --> 00:10:34,594
[QUATRE:] Wait a minute! Please
look into Trowa
Barton's whereabouts.

131
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,614
I know he's alive! There are
lots of colonies in that area.

132
00:10:38,974 --> 00:10:42,194
I know he'll be able to make it
through, I just know it.

133
00:10:42,794 --> 00:10:44,194
That's some personality.

134
00:10:44,454 --> 00:10:47,474
A little questionable for a
soldier though,
wouldn't you say?

135
00:10:48,674 --> 00:10:52,044
That's why the Gundam Zero ended
up in the hands of the enemy,

136
00:10:52,044 --> 00:10:53,794
even with that system installed.

137
00:10:54,114 --> 00:10:54,734
What?

138
00:10:54,874 --> 00:10:58,914
The system has a device which
amplifies and controls
brainwaves associated with

139
00:10:58,914 --> 00:11:02,694
fighting and brings about battle
results greater than the
pilot's normal skills

140
00:11:02,694 --> 00:11:03,914
could achieve on their own.

141
00:11:04,214 --> 00:11:07,234
It would've been alright if the
pilot saw Oz as the enemy,

142
00:11:07,234 --> 00:11:10,954
but the mind warping side
effects of the system caused an
error in his target.

143
00:11:11,194 --> 00:11:13,484
The fact that the pilot was
incomplete as a

144
00:11:13,484 --> 00:11:16,114
soldier resulted in his
attacking his own allies.

145
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:18,174
Extremely regrettable.

146
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:21,304
Especially considering that with
the combined power of
the Vayeate,

00:11:21,304 --> 00:11:25,234
the Mercurius and the new
Gundam, the Lunar Base could
have been demolished
all at once.

physical power and

art of war are no less
than perfect.

[MASTER O:] But we find that as
soldiers, you're mentally
far from perfect.

151
00:11:37,134 --> 00:11:40,274
[MASTER O:] This latest incident
has brought that flaw out
into the open.

00:11:40,754 --> 00:11:43,214
[PROFESSOR G:] You must become
the perfect soldiers!

[QUATRE:] I had no idea! I never
knew that unit had
been completed.

157

large beam cannon and

158

didn't pay as much attention to
the system installed
in the cockpit.

The beam cannon hasn't been
retrieved yet. The main
weapons right now

vulcans on it's shoulders.
