Hey! Quatre! What's

00:01:29,740 --> 00:01:31,980
Tell the others for me..

Tell them to stay away from me!
Otherwise I'll end up
killing them.

If everything has gone crazy...

Heero... Why are
fighting each other?

15
00:03:29,094 --> 00:03:31,314
The colonies have
teamed up with OZ.

16
00:03:31,974 --> 00:03:33,954
They're my enemies now.

Outer space has lost all reason!
That's why I'm gonna
destroy everything.

That's natural... isn't it?

Hey! Are you listening to me?

24
00:04:13,634 --> 00:04:19,194
Quatre... I'm not leaving.
There's a colony that needs
to be defended.

00:04:40,214 --> 00:04:46,054
<i>[QUATRE:] Heero... I can't</i>
<i>stand that colony any longer!</i>

26
00:04:49,794 --> 00:04:52,554
[TECHNICIAN 1:] We have no
communication from Trowa
Barton's Vayeate

27
00:04:54,654 --> 00:04:55,074
Or the Leo unit that are
currently fighting the Gundam!

28
00:04:55,074 --> 00:04:58,114
[TECHNICIAN 2:] THe whole unit,
including the Mercurius may
have been wiped out.

29
00:04:58,494 --> 00:05:00,074
And that colony?

30
00:05:00,314 --> 00:05:00,774
Huh?

31
00:05:00,974 --> 00:05:02,874
Is that colony still there?

32
00:05:02,974 --> 00:05:06,054
Yes, so far it's been spared
from any significant damage.

33
00:05:06,334 --> 00:05:08,854
That means the battle is
still going on.

34
00:05:09,634 --> 00:05:14,614
Fighting to protect the colonies
is exactly what righteous
Gundam pilots would do.

35
00:05:14,814 --> 00:05:18,014
Hopefully they'll be able to
stop this new Gundam.

36
00:05:18,534 --> 00:05:22,034
[TECHNICIAN 1:] We've received
these images from the
mothership of Leo's unit.

00:05:23,834 --> 00:05:27,254
[UNE:] Good, now send these to
the Gundam engineers at
the Lunar Base.

38
00:05:27,254 --> 00:05:29,434
We should be able to find out
something from them.

39
00:05:30,094 --> 00:05:34,694
But Colonel, at this very moment
we are unable to communicate
with the Lunar Base!

00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:35,474

42
00:05:40,594 --> 00:05:44,074
We've just received orders from
Fortress Barge to restore
communication.

43
00:05:44,074 --> 00:05:48,954
Nevermind. We must follow the
orders we have received
from Duke Dermail

44
00:05:48,954 --> 00:05:51,474
to speed up production of
the mobile dolls.

45
00:05:52,214 --> 00:05:55,294
[TUBAROV:] There appears to be
some unrest within Romefeller.

46
00:05:56,294 --> 00:05:58,474
Humans cannot be trusted.

47

[DOCTOR J:] You old guys seem
nice and calm, considering that

50
00:06:08,074 --> 00:06:11,114
we probably don't have long
before the air runs out!

51
00:06:11,974 --> 00:06:17,294
What a way to die and we haven't
even had a chance to get revenge
against OZ at all!

52
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:22,334
I would have loved to see that
new Gundam that showed
up recently too!

53
00:06:23,354 --> 00:06:28,954
And we have not completed
upgrading the new Deathscythe
and Shenlong, it's such a shame.

54
00:06:30,534 --> 00:06:32,774
Those are my words exactly

55
00:06:42,514 --> 00:06:45,674
I never would've guessed I'd be
dying like this...

Hey Wu Fei... my Deathscythe's
pretty cool, don't you think?

I'll demolish OZ in
no time at all.

What's wrong? Are you
dead already?

Wu Fei, don't be deserting me
at a time like this.

You gotta stick with me right

Right to the very end he
refuses to give up.

In that case I'm just gonna
have to kill you.

how it happened, but the
colonies have teamed up with OZ.

00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:12,274
And we have to keep in mind it
does mark the end of a war.

79
00:09:13,194 --> 00:09:17,694
At the same time it does mean
that our missions have
come to an end.

80
00:09:18,294 --> 00:09:21,694
<i>[TROWA:] From our point of view</i>

81
00:09:21,694 --> 00:09:23,814
<i>been fighting for have changed</i>
<i>their perspectives.</i>

82
00:09:24,874 --> 00:09:29,334

<i>What happens within our hearts?</i>

85
00:09:36,074 --> 00:09:39,894
With us Gundam pilots, we were
completely trained
to be soldiers

86
00:09:39,894 --> 00:09:41,514
before we even realized it.

87
00:09:42,134 --> 00:09:45,904
When you put everything into a
battle, you start to
think that you

88
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:48,714
can change the times, all by
yourself, don't you?

89
00:09:50,134 --> 00:09:53,854
<i>[TROWA:] But Quatre, you're not</i>
<i>the only one who feels that way.</i>

90
00:09:54,614 --> 00:09:55,974
<i>We all do.</i>

91
00:09:56,394 --> 00:10:00,274
<i>But the kinder you are, the</i>
<i>bigger the toll it takes on you.</i>

92
00:10:02,374 --> 00:10:05,694
<i>[TROWA:] We have to fight with</i>
<i>ourselves in our hearts, and we</i>
<i>have to do it harshly,</i>

93
00:10:05,694 --> 00:10:08,034
<i>in order to come to the</i>
<i>right conclusions.</i>

94
00:10:08,034 --> 00:10:10,574
<i>Even if it means our battles to</i>
<i>date are meaningless.</i>

95
00:10:10,814 --> 00:10:12,594
We have to
acknowledge the facts.

96
00:10:14,214 --> 00:10:18,274
The five of us have become
nothing more than redundant
soldiers, Quatre.

97
00:10:20,114 --> 00:10:22,414
So now, let's accept it.

00:10:23,574 --> 00:10:26,254

108
00:11:05,374 --> 00:11:08,854
Pretty halfhearted way to go
around fighting.

109
00:11:08,854 --> 00:11:12,274
I guess that Trowa's death
was just a waste!

110
00:11:19,574 --> 00:11:24,654

With the financial power of the
Romefeller foundation,

114
00:11:59,074 --> 00:12:02,734
a revolution in the
technological skills of space
will now be possible!

115

The system for mass production

00:12:07,954 --> 00:12:11,654
[DERMAIL:] As the ruling class

position mobile dolls

117
00:12:11,654 --> 00:12:14,274
in dispute ridden regions
in each country.

118
00:12:15,514 --> 00:12:18,304
Thus gentlemen, we will show
the entire world how

119
00:12:18,304 --> 00:12:21,334
powerful we are and thereby
bring order to the earth.

120
00:12:21,714 --> 00:12:25,374
Is it not time for us to once
again create an era are where

121
00:12:25,374 --> 00:12:29,794
again practiced so that we may
govern this world properly?

[APPLAUSE]

123
00:12:37,754 --> 00:12:40,834
Treize, I'm relying on your
leadership of OZ.

124
00:12:41,854 --> 00:12:46,054
Duke Dermail, I'm sorry but I
cannot support the
Romefeller Foundation

125
00:12:46,054 --> 00:12:47,514
in the path it's taking.

126
00:12:47,794 --> 00:12:48,714
What!?

127
00:12:49,294 --> 00:12:52,714
Tradition is a history. It's the
history of caring,

128
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:55,394
built by deep true
feelings of people.

129
00:12:55,894 --> 00:13:00,694
I do think that fighting in
battles can at times indeed be,
beautiful.

130
00:13:00,934 --> 00:13:03,794
But at the same time I'd like
to express my regret

131
00:13:04,014 --> 00:13:09,554
[TREIZE:] over the lost souls by
appealing to you to recognize
how priceless man's life is.

132
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:15,094
I believe what mankind needs, is
not absolute victory but a
certain demeanor in fighting,

133
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:16,654
an attitude toward fighting.

134
00:13:17,154 --> 00:13:20,654
[TREIZE:] I fear that the era of
the soulless weapons called
"mobile dolls",

135
00:13:20,834 --> 00:13:24,314
in other words, the era that the
Romefeller foundation
is creating,

136
00:13:24,674 --> 00:13:27,414
may become an embarrassment to
the people of the future.

137
00:13:27,854 --> 00:13:31,394
<i>[TREIZE:] I used to think that</i>
<i>the ideals of the people in</i>

<i>such as their highly</i>
<i>praised pacifism,</i>

139
00:13:34,094 --> 00:13:37,434
<i>were just pitiful complaints,</i>
<i>born out of their</i>
<i>ignorance of tradition.</i>

140
00:13:39,114 --> 00:13:43,014
Hey listen Deathscythe, don't
give up too easily.

141
00:13:43,274 --> 00:13:45,814
You're gonna be ok, right?

142
00:13:46,054 --> 00:13:48,414
About to commence the

143
00:14:00,174 --> 00:14:04,194
No. No!!!

It's not that mobile dolls
transcend death,
