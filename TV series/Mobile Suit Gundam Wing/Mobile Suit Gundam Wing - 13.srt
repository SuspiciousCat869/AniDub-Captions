<i>[NARRATOR:] To facilitate it's</i>
<i>reign over the world,</i>

3
00:01:34,162 --> 00:01:37,846
<i>Romefeller Foundation promoted a</i>
<i>new Oz.</i>

4
00:01:37,973 --> 00:01:41,135
<i>With it's main power consisting of</i>
<i>unmanned units</i>

5
00:01:41,303 --> 00:01:42,518
<i>called mobile</i>
<i>dolls.</i>

6
00:01:42,645 --> 00:01:45,108
<i>Certain changes within the</i>
<i>Foundation</i>

7
00:01:45,276 --> 00:01:48,006
<i>followed Treize Khushenrada's</i>
<i>retaliation,</i>

8
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:51,058
<i>including his being stripped of</i>
<i>all power.</i>

9
00:01:51,226 --> 00:01:52,326
<i>At the same time,</i>

10
00:01:52,488 --> 00:01:56,018
<i>the Foundation was rapidly</i>
<i>expanding its area of rule,</i>

11
00:01:56,186 --> 00:01:57,943
<i>thanks to the highly</i>
<i>skilled mobile dolls.</i>

12
00:01:58,076 --> 00:02:02,581
<i>After the space colonies</i>
<i>accepted the foundation,</i>

13
00:02:02,748 --> 00:02:04,721
<i>execution orders were released</i>

14
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:07,128
<i>for the now isolated Gundam</i>
<i>pilots. For them,</i>

15
00:02:07,336 --> 00:02:11,340
<i>it looked like the future</i>
<i>would take a turn for the worse.</i>

16
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:24,228
<i>Don't die. Keep fighting and</i>
<i>prolong your life kid.</i>

17
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:27,356
<i>You pilots, you mustn’t die yet.</i>

18
00:02:32,986 --> 00:02:35,490
<i>And It's Name Is Epyon</i>

19
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,421
Is this the end?

20
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:54,841
Relena...

21
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:10,525
Long live Treize Khushrenada!

22
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:15,613
[EXPLOSION]

23
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:39,136
You okay?

24
00:03:39,678 --> 00:03:42,973
Protect Master Treize, I beg you.

25
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,798
Duke Dermail?

26
00:03:59,948 --> 00:04:02,663
[DERMAIL:] Yes what is it?
Did we receive confirmation

27
00:04:02,826 --> 00:04:04,726
of the Treize
Faction's destruction?

28
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:06,935
No sir, not exactly.

29
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:10,068
Why not?! How could they
be withstanding our attack,

30
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:13,253
when we sent such a
powerful military force there?

31
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,798
A Gundam.
‐ What's that?

32
00:04:15,965 --> 00:04:17,713
Gundam 01 has joined them.

33
00:04:17,881 --> 00:04:20,578
We lost half of the mobile dolls
we sent.

34
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:23,300
And it's turning into a virtual
riot.

35
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:26,321
At this rate, it's just a matter
of time before Treize Khushrenada

36
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,560
is freed from
confinement.

37
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:30,395
What shall we do now Duke Dermail?

38
00:04:30,771 --> 00:04:33,686
Contact our ground troops
stationed elsewhere.

39
00:04:33,816 --> 00:04:38,013
Tell them to head for Luxembourg
at once to wipe out the Gundam,

40
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,613
and the
Treize Faction.

41
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,020
Treize is nothing more than a
mirage

42
00:04:44,188 --> 00:04:46,503
with which to dazzle the faction
soldiers.

43
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:50,391
In exactly the same way as the
Gundam's symbolize the rebels.

44
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,880
We must do everything in our
powers

45
00:04:53,048 --> 00:04:55,588
to prevent the two from joining
forces.

46
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:18,808
Voice and fingerprints
verification check.

47
00:05:18,976 --> 00:05:19,945
State your name.

48
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:30,581
Heero Yuy.

49
00:05:31,790 --> 00:05:34,376
Identity confirmed. Please enter.

50
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:59,443
[TREIZE:] Thanks for
coming Heero Yuy.

51
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:08,758
I welcome you with my heart,
dear messenger of peace.

52
00:06:08,911 --> 00:06:10,263
You must be Treize.

53
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:14,458
That should be obvious. Now just
go ahead and shoot me.

54
00:06:14,626 --> 00:06:16,460
Put an end to this
battle.

55
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:25,525
What’s the matter?

56
00:06:25,693 --> 00:06:28,053
The battle won’t end as long
as I’m alive.

57
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,183
Isn’t that the
reason you came here?

58
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:32,351
[HEERO:] Tell me why
you let me in!

59
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:34,406
[TREIZE:] I programmed the
computer

60
00:06:34,575 --> 00:06:35,938
to accept you a few months ago.

61
00:06:36,188 --> 00:06:39,028
I thought one of these days I
could have a long

62
00:06:39,196 --> 00:06:41,610
discussion with you and the other
pilots.

63
00:06:42,653 --> 00:06:45,351
I have no interest in you Treize.

64
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:47,505
Of course not, you pilots should
just

65
00:06:47,673 --> 00:06:49,303
be thinking of obtaining peace.

66
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,781
Peace for the earth, or rather
peace that

67
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:54,165
will spread through the entire
Universe.

68
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,286
Fighting is my only concern. Peace
is no more

69
00:06:59,455 --> 00:07:02,506
than an outcome after the fighting
has ended.

70
00:07:02,673 --> 00:07:06,181
Then let me ask you: who is your
enemy?

71
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:09,318
Is it me? Or Oz? Is it Romefeller?

72
00:07:09,471 --> 00:07:14,018
Or is it your far away home,
the colony that has betrayed you?

73
00:07:14,393 --> 00:07:18,196
Those who stand before me with the
intention of killing me.

74
00:07:18,365 --> 00:07:19,511
They’re
my enemies.

75
00:07:19,648 --> 00:07:22,736
In that case, your battles will
never end,

76
00:07:22,905 --> 00:07:25,403
since your enemy is destiny
itself.

77
00:07:25,613 --> 00:07:28,166
Maybe so, but I’ll continue to
fight.

78
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:30,331
That’s the only choice I have.

79
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:33,175
And I don’t give a damn
when I do die.

80
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,975
Don’t you have any desire to try
and enjoy your destiny?

81
00:07:37,123 --> 00:07:41,586
In my opinion, Relena Peacecraft
is a much stronger person than you

82
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,026
I never thought that you’d be
feeling

83
00:07:46,195 --> 00:07:48,343
the limitations of your continuous
battle.

84
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,815
But it’s a fact that nobody is
able to

85
00:07:50,983 --> 00:07:52,765
change the course of our times.

86
00:07:53,098 --> 00:07:55,388
Well you should be able to. You
used

87
00:07:55,556 --> 00:07:58,038
to have the power to control the
future.

88
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,731
You just need to repeat
what you did before.

89
00:08:01,773 --> 00:08:03,566
I have no intention of doing that.

90
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:04,901
I see.

91
00:08:05,401 --> 00:08:07,101
[TREIZE:] My greatest happiness in
life

92
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,613
was being able to talk with you.

93
00:08:13,995 --> 00:08:15,960
And now I truly understand.

94
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:19,703
The time of my own death
must coincide with yours.

95
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:23,711
Now that we’ve met each other,
lets put ourselves in God’s hands.

96
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:28,466
Not a very good loser are you?
Well it makes no difference to me.

97
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,598
A soldier who’s willing to die. In
my opinion,

98
00:08:31,766 --> 00:08:34,198
that's the most correct attitude a
person can take to fight.

99
00:08:34,348 --> 00:08:39,270
But unfortunately,
you’ve lost sight of your enemy.

100
00:08:39,645 --> 00:08:44,525
That makes you the same as myself.
My battle has also come to an end.

101
00:08:44,983 --> 00:08:46,526
Your battle hasn’t ended.

102
00:08:47,695 --> 00:08:48,910
[HEERO:] Even as we speak,

103
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,638
countless soldiers are
sacrificing their lives for you,

104
00:08:51,781 --> 00:08:54,535
I know for certain that your
battle hasn’t ended.

105
00:08:57,663 --> 00:09:01,766
If anything has ended, or rather,
if anything should end,

106
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,796
then it’s my own miserable
and useless retaliation.

107
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:10,676
Heero Yuy, I implore you.

108
00:09:10,845 --> 00:09:13,845
Please, don’t disappoint me any
further.

109
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:17,391
You mustn’t be in the same
position as myself.

110
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:27,610
I have a guide here that will show
you how to live from now on.

111
00:09:43,708 --> 00:09:44,585
Huh!?

112
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,241
<i>[SCARECROW 5:]</i>
<i>This is Scarecrow 5,</i>

113
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:00,198
<i>we’ve confirmed the presence of</i>
<i>Wing Zero.</i>

114
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:02,018
<i>We’ll continue with our operation.</i>

115
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:08,838
<i>[SOLDIER:] I think this is</i>
<i>enough explosives.</i>

116
00:10:08,983 --> 00:10:11,686
<i>[SCARECROW 5:] It's enough to</i>
<i>blow up three Leo suits!</i>

117
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,696
Good. Back to your Leo.

118
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:16,325
[HOWARD:] So they’re gonna
blow it up after all?

119
00:10:16,533 --> 00:10:17,723
That’s only natural.

120
00:10:17,891 --> 00:10:18,698
Because to Oz,

121
00:10:18,866 --> 00:10:21,751
(or for that matter,
to the Romefeller foundation)

122
00:10:21,913 --> 00:10:23,533
any Gundam stands between them

123
00:10:23,701 --> 00:10:25,541
and their goal to conquer
everyone.

124
00:10:26,668 --> 00:10:29,338
Why don’t we show them what
that thing’s really worth?

125
00:10:31,923 --> 00:10:34,935
<i>[SCARECROW 5:] Okay we'll proceed</i>
<i>to blow up Wing Zero.</i>

126
00:10:35,093 --> 00:10:36,903
<i>[SOLDIER:] Object approaching</i>
<i>at high speed!</i>

127
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,055
What!?

128
00:10:39,765 --> 00:10:42,726
<i>[SOLDIER:] It’s the Tallgeese!</i>
<i>Lightning Count is here!</i>

129
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:57,606
[EXPLOSION]

130
00:10:57,741 --> 00:10:58,575
DAMMIT!

131
00:11:02,078 --> 00:11:05,498
Fortress Barge, this is Scarecrow
5, the Tallgeese is here!

132
00:11:10,838 --> 00:11:12,198
Why escape from battle?

133
00:11:12,366 --> 00:11:15,591
Has the influx of mobile
dolls made the soldiers forget

134
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:20,555
how to fight? Or have my beliefs
simply become outdated?

135
00:11:21,931 --> 00:11:23,713
[HOWARD:] Be on your guard Zechs!

136
00:11:23,881 --> 00:11:26,978
A high‐speed carrier full of
mobile dolls is heading here!

137
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:34,026
By their formation it seems like
they were expecting me.

138
00:11:36,446 --> 00:11:39,536
Considering how much they rely on
mobile dolls,

139
00:11:39,705 --> 00:11:41,868
it’s a fairly obvious
battle plan.

140
00:11:58,301 --> 00:12:01,763
Mobile doll reinforcements,
they seem pretty well prepared!

141
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:24,870
There's more troops!

142
00:12:31,501 --> 00:12:35,380
I see. Looks like they’ve
overrated my abilities.

143
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,996
<i>[SCARECROW 5:] Hah! Units 7 to 12,</i>
<i>spread out</i>

144
00:12:38,165 --> 00:12:39,271
<i>and surround the rest.</i>

145
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:42,303
I’m not going to let you
escape Lightning Count!

146
00:12:58,236 --> 00:13:02,573
Tallgeese. The reason I made
it this far was because of you.

147
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:05,535
[EXPLOSION]

148
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,121
<i>[ZECHS:] I’m eternally grateful.</i>

149
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:17,130
It will be tough to part with you.

150
00:13:25,096 --> 00:13:25,738
But‐

151
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:29,310
<i>[ZECHS:] ‐my priority right now</i>
<i>is to survive this battle.</i>

152
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,943
[ZECHS:] Ugh. Farewell Tallgeese.

153
00:13:47,828 --> 00:13:51,248
<i>[ZECHS:] Rest in peace my</i>
<i>admirable friend.</i>

154
00:14:02,633 --> 00:14:05,500
He blew it up. Is he going to
surrender?

155

Why don’t I provide him with a
somewhat more appropriate death.

Once you meet your maker,

you should curse yourself for

What an incredible response time!
And this battle power...

171
00:15:54,455 --> 00:15:57,638
A perfect warrior like yourself
should be able to avoid

172
00:15:57,791 --> 00:16:00,668
being trifled with by that
detestable machine.

A new model?

178
00:16:21,565 --> 00:16:24,423
Yes, and I've given it
the name “Epyon”.

179
00:16:24,568 --> 00:16:28,068
This suit has the ability to show
the pilot the image of the enemy

180
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,810
he’s fighting and the pilot’s own
future.

Regretfully there wasn’t any
future

182
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:36,583
for me to choose from.
After you've piloted this suit,

183
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:41,335
if you end up just like myself,
let us both part with our lives.

184
00:16:42,335 --> 00:16:44,505
Why did you decide to
make this thing?

185
00:16:44,713 --> 00:16:47,875
All my life I’ve felt that humans
sense their existence

186
00:16:48,043 --> 00:16:49,466
through continuous
battle.

187
00:16:49,718 --> 00:16:53,088
However, I couldn't come to
any conclusions.

188
00:16:53,221 --> 00:16:54,736
My battle’s now over,

189
00:16:54,905 --> 00:16:58,893
but I still have yet to determine
the reason for battle.

190
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:00,895
To find that reason,

191
00:17:01,063 --> 00:17:04,733
I figured a Gundam would be
the most appropriate mobile suit.

192
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:07,411
In addition, I'd like to give my
blessings

193
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:08,758
to the winner and loser.

194
00:17:08,903 --> 00:17:11,656
This mobile suit
allows me to do so.

195

[HEERO:] Do you think you've
built a god or something?

196
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,325
Maybe I do.

197
00:17:16,493 --> 00:17:19,943
As long as the warrior has
a genuine will to fight,

198
00:17:20,081 --> 00:17:22,708
the Epyon will eliminate
all distractions.

199
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,893
[TREIZE:] There's nothing more
noble or beautiful

200
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:27,973
than a warrior with no
distractions.

201
00:17:28,141 --> 00:17:30,716
One could say that
he's the closest thing to God.

I don’t believe in god.
