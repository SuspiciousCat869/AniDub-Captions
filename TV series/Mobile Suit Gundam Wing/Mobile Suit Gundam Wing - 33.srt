00:12:22,760 --> 00:12:26,200
Trowa's like my brother. He
belongs with us!

156
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,600
But Trowa's...

157
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:32,360
I can't bear to see him suffer
any more than he already has.
He's lost his

158
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,280
memories of the past because
they're too painful for him. He
doesn't want to remember.

159
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:43,320
It's my fault. It's all my fault
and I'm truly sorry.
Trowa sacrificed

160
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:46,870
himself to correct a mistake
that I had made myself.

161
00:12:46,870 --> 00:12:50,840
I know apologizing won't fix
things but I really am sorry.

162
00:12:50,960 --> 00:12:54,200
If that's the way you feel
just leave him!

163
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:57,240
Trowa's a lot happier now being
here at the circus with us.

[DUO] Can you still fight?

172
00:13:57,520 --> 00:14:03,480
Yeah, I guess you got a point.
This isn't like me at all,
is it?

to see Trowa...

Oz and White Fang troops is

starting to spread into this

It's a battle. Mobile suits have
started exchanging fire
near the colony.

But why? We're just trying to

the sake of the

00:20:57,950 --> 00:21:02,300
I think of this as the first
step along a very positive road.

254

And upon this road we can
all walk together.

We can eliminate wars
and create peace.

and stop fighting.

all hoping for the same future.

of all national borders.

certainly has the ability to

attract the hearts of the people
to Romefeller. But I seriously

realizes just how much of a risk
this move will be.
