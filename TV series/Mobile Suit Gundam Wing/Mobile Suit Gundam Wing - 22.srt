[DUO] So what've you got
up your sleeves?

29
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:18,870
Well the first thing we want you
to do is to take us over
to Peacemillion.

30
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:21,000
[DUO] To Peacemillion?

31
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Zechs will certainly have his
way unless we do
something to stop him.

32
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:32,000
We want to change Libra's orbit
but in order to do so we have to
board Peacemillion.

33
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,900
When you say “Zechs' way” you
mean he's really...

34
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:41,750
That's right. He's targeting
Earth to the very end. We'll be
able to atone for our sins

35
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:46,420
the moment we can put a stop to
his maniacal schemes
and evil plans.

36
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,850
Alright then. Follow me.

37
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:55,350
Have you finished calculating
the wave course yet?

38
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,570
[PILOT] Yes. We can enter
Earth's atmosphere if we
continue on the present course.

39
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:05,520
There's a 69% chance that we'll
collide on land in the
northern hemisphere.

40
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,120
The energy that'll be released
is estimated at about
6000 megatons.

41
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:15,600
Did you hear that information
Commander Milliardo?

42
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:18,370
[ZECHS] That'll be
plenty Quinze.

43
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:23,120
If the Peacemillion and Libra
both crashed on that
green planet

44
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:28,450
seasons would cease to exist &amp;
then they'd be plagued with an
everlasting winter.

45
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:33,700
However commander this
calculation is based on the
assumption that

46
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:37,700
Peacemillion's drive system
remains turned off.

47
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:43,020
Peacemillion used to be a ship
of mine. I know it'll
understand my intentions.

48
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,770
[QUINZE] Yes sir.

49
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:48,100
Can you say that about the
Gundam pilots Zechs?

50
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:53,500
Of course. No doubt they will do
everything they can to
try and stop me.

51
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:56,800
So you're waiting for them huh?

52
00:05:56,800 --> 00:06:01,800
[ZECHS] Those pilots don't act
in a way that's inevitable
or predestined.

53
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,800
That's what makes them

any reason left to
keep on fighting.

and the White Fang have
been defeated.

doesn't think that he's lost.

Do you really think if you go
that the war's going to
come to an end?

64
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:04,720
I'll defeat Zechs, and I'll go
get Treize. Then the
war will be over.

the Zero System.

the mobile doll control system
to the Zero System.

00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:11,200
the Zero System. But I wonder
what'll happen this time around.
So you've decided

87
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,370
you can fight without the
Zero System right?

88
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:19,850
I wouldn't fight if I could help
it. But unless I keep on
fighting you people won't

89
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,000
surrender and the war
will never end!

90

That's absolutely right. Now
let's determine for ourselves
which is more advanced:

91
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,700

fight if I'm going to ward off
my family's sorrow.

96
00:09:56,050 --> 00:10:02,250
My father did that. He fought so
that I wouldn't feel any sorrow
and he died for it.

destruction and massacre. The
enemies we must defeat

100

are in our respective hearts!

surpasses war. I believe in the
heart that hopes for peace.

for you in return?

Maybe you're right. This is the
only way I really know
how to fight.

147
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:08,500
But it's because we take on
losing battles that we've
been able to keep the

148
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:12,000
colonists from the
horrors of war.

149
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,000
[DOROTHY] You'll never change
anything that way.

150
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:18,000
[QUATRE] Then what do you
suggest I should have done?

151
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:22,300
You should have become the
leader of the colonies and
staged a magnificent war

152
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:26,200
[DOROTHY] Just like Mr.
Milliardo's doing.
Dorothy you're mistak‐

153
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:30,300
And you should have staged this
war in front of all of mankind.

154
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:34,670
A miserable war that they'll
never ever want to see again!

155
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:38,850
[QUATRE] Are you saying that's
the significance of this war?

156
00:15:38,850 --> 00:15:45,400
That's right. You can't do away
with wars Quatre by just taking
weapons from people.

157
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:51,320
You first have to change the
hearts of all of mankind. If you
don't do that humanity

158
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,500
will... it will perish just
like my father did.

159
00:15:55,500 --> 00:16:01,950
You are a very kind person.
Kinder than me. [DOROTHY] That
doesn't make me the least

160
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:08,000
bit happy. Kindness just gets in
your way when you're
trying to survive.

161
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:12,700
It's more appropriate for
mankind to put all their efforts
into just surviving!

162
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:18,800
Dorothy you're just the same way
I used to be. You can't stand
your own kindness

163
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,750
and your own hatred of war. You
should never try to fight your
kindness. Trowa taught

164
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:30,900
me that. You have to try and
accept every‐ thing around you
because humanity needs

165
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:41,800
that kindness. Without kindness
mankind has no reason to exist.

166
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:47,820
You agree don't you? Humans that
only think of their
survival are life forms

167
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:54,850
that are lower than animals!
They can't even feel
for others...

168
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:07,400
[TREIZE] What's wrong? How come
you don't use your dragon?

169
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,250
Because I want to fight you fair
and square Treize.
That's how come.

170
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:16,250
[TREIZE] That's not like you.
Why the hesitation?

171
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:20,050
[WU FEI] Look who's talking! Why
didn't you kill me back there?

172
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:25,420
Well I just couldn't kill one of
the few people that
understood me. That's all.

173
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:28,300
[WU FEI] You loser!

174
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,850
I can't stand the sight of you!

175
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:35,470
Then come and get me now.

176
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:46,800
You're only capable of looking
down on people like this.
You're only fighting

177
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:51,500
to satisfy your ego. How many
people have died for you?

178
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:58,750
[TREIZE] Do you really want to
know? As of yesterday
99,822 people.

179
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,720
[WU FEI] What?

180
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:04,000
[TREIZE] Lady how many
have died today?

181
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:09,000
So far we have received
confirmation of the deaths of 82
White Fang soldiers

182
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:15,050
and 105 of our own soldiers. ‐ I
see. Give me their names
later on today.

183
00:18:15,050 --> 00:18:17,520
[LADY UN] Yes sir. I will.

184
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,670
Damn you!

185
00:18:19,670 --> 00:18:25,150
I remember everyone who has
sacrificed their lives in
Battle. How could I

186
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:30,270
forget them? Noventa. Septem.
Ventei. Darlian. Walker. Otto.
Bunt.

187
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:33,800
Their names are all
etched into my heart.

188
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,400
How could you be such a ‐

189
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,700
[TREIZE] I could only grieve
over the lives lost by those
who fought. But...

190
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:47,820
at least try to understand this:
Not one of those people
have died in vain.

191
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,500
[ELECTRICITY SIZZLING]

192
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:59,900
That was beautiful Wu Fei.

193
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:03,070
No Treize! How could you?!

194
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:12,950
Bye Wu Fei. My eternal friend.
I'm honored I could fight
with you pilots.

195
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:18,500
This can't be true! No way! I
won't let this happen!

196
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:25,800
[TREIZE] Milliardo. I'll be
waiting on the other side.

197
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:28,820
[EXPLOSION]

198
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:35,420
Damn it!! I didn't
think I'd win.

199
00:19:44,370 --> 00:19:47,200
[SOLDIER] Colonel Un?
Your orders?

200
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:52,600
You must get in touch with the
White Fang. Tell them as
of this moment

201
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:56,570
the World Nation
declares its defeat.

202
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,270
Huh Colonel?

203
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:03,450
This is humiliating don't make
me repeat myself send
them the message!

204
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:07,670
[SOLDIER] Yes ma'am! Mr.
Treize... you were splendid.

205
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:17,170
This is the right way.
This is good.

206
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:22,050
So there you are Ms. Dorothy.
The Earth delegates have
just contacted

207
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:24,900
us and they have
announced their defeat.

208
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:29,920
What? The Earth has declared its
surrender? [QUINZE] Also the
combat observation

209
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:32,621
unit has just informed us that
Treize Khushrenada has
died in battle.

210
00:20:32,621 --> 00:20:36,501
No! That Just can't be! [QUINZE]
The victory belongs to us.
But that

211
00:20:36,501 --> 00:20:40,551
doesn't change our plans to ram
this ship into Earth. Those are

212
00:20:40,551 --> 00:20:45,351
Commander Milliardo's orders.
We'll start the final boost.
Evacuate the ship

213
00:20:45,351 --> 00:20:49,621
at your own discretion. Good
luck. Keep safe.

214
00:20:49,621 --> 00:20:55,150
[TROWA] Things didn't go as
planned did they? In a way
what you people

215
00:20:55,150 --> 00:21:00,720
were trying to do was probably
the right thing. But it still
won't bring true peace.

216
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,220
I was only...

217
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:06,670
[TROWA] That's sad. A
woman who can't cry.

218
00:21:06,820 --> 00:21:09,600
The Earth has declared defeat?!

219
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:11,920
I don't believe it!

220
00:21:11,920 --> 00:21:16,900
Things are not over yet people.
The White Fang plans to
direct Libra and

221
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:22,000
Peacemillion to ram into Earth.
[RELENA] Let's turn around.
If we go now

222
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:26,600
we should still be able to stop
them. [HOWARD] That would
be impossible.

223
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:31,100
We can't say for sure until we
try. [SALLY] There's one
person who could

224
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:34,700
make the impossible possible.
[RELENA] Heero?!

225
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:38,650
You bet. But there's absolutely
no way we could tell him
that right now.

226
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:43,100
[RELENA] Quickly let's go to
Heero. We can't. The shuttle's
used up the propulsion

227
00:21:43,100 --> 00:21:46,850
energy for the initial boost.
[SALLY] Relena!

228
00:21:46,850 --> 00:21:51,700
[RELENA] In that case I'll go
alone. [SOLDIER] No stop!

229
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:56,400
Let me go! Heero I'm on my way!

230
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:03,750
He's finally here.

231
00:22:28,870 --> 00:22:35,100
[ENDING THEME]

232
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:41,350
[NARRATOR] Battles are started
by people. And people realize
peace through battle.

233
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:47,250
But how many lives must be lost
as a result? And what's the
meaning of plowing

234
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:53,500
Peacemillion and Libra into
Earth? In the final stages of
battle the two Gundams

235
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:59,870
predict the dawn of a new age.
Next on the final episode
of Gundam Wing:

236
00:23:59,870 --> 00:24:04,550
The Final Victor.
