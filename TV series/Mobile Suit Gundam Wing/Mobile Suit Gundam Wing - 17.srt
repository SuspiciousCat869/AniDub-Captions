1
00:00:01,230 --> 00:00:03,720
[MUSIC]

2
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,280
We are now positioned to
stage an all‐out

3
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,970
missile attack on the colonies!

4
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:39,260
You guys can fight,
well can't you?!

5
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:41,390
Mission accepted.

6
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,150
[Narrator:] "The
Whereabouts of Happiness"

7
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:26,910
There's really no way out, with
all this security.

8
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:28,960
Besides, to swipe a carrier...

9
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:32,000
...I'd have to cross the entire
desert to get to the
closest airport.

10
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:33,560
Huh?

11
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,410
That guy...

12
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:49,900
We're in the same boat.

13
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:51,960
With all those planes
looking out for us...

14
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,760
...there's not much you
guys can do either.

15
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,330
A fairly large sandstorm
is on the way.

16
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,600
we'll be crossing the
desert then.

17
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:01,920
Wanna join us?

18
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,130
Yeah, I do.

19
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:05,610
I could use some sympathy now.

20
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,550
And I need time to think too.

21
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,400
We've collected what we could.

22
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,550
But the important parts have
all been destroyed.

23
00:03:23,710 --> 00:03:24,800
I thought so.

24
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
That's why he self‐destructed.

25
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:30,320
Even Gundams can end up as
mere scraps of metal.

26
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,460
Or rather, scraps of Gundanium.

27
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,320
This Gundam design was based
on the Tallgeese.

28
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:38,810
So the fundamental technology
for the Tallgeese
should applicable.

29
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:39,640
Colonel?

30
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,340
Yes, Noin.

31
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,470
Would you mind if I took this
Gundam with me...

32
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,360
...to the Lake Victoria Base?

33
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:45,950
Huh?

34
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,140
Are you planning to fix it?

35
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,250
Yes...

36
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:52,240
Why bother?

37
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:55,260
Perhaps I'm just preoccupied
with that pilot.

38
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,320
But the Gundam pilot
died didn't he.

39
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,590
I just have this feeling
that he's alive.

40
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:03,280
It's pretty well impossible
after that explosion.

41
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,800
But I honestly hope
that he is alive.

42
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,240
As a fellow mobile suit pilot,
he was someone

43
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,240
that I was destined to
do battle with.

44
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,810
I'm terribly sorry!

45
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,920
Your Excellency...

46
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,850
I shouldn't have acted

47
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,590
on my own to plan a direct
attack on the colonies.

48
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,970
Well that's all water under
the bridge now.

49
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:23,340
At least we know that the Gundam
attacks were planned...

50
00:04:23,340 --> 00:04:27,080
...by certain extraordinary
people, to retaliate
against our actions.

51
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:30,280
Our target is still to destroy
all of the Gundams.

52
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:32,720
But their supporters concern me.

53
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:34,510
In outer space.

54
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,520
I'd prefer to keep the enemy
from becoming any more powerful.

55
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,440
Can I rely on you, Lady Une?

56
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,200
Yes.

57
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,200
I'll eliminate them at once.

58
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,850
Uh, Your Excellency...?

59
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:47,740
The peace‐minded people of
the colonies...

60
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:50,060
...will not prefer any
sign of militarism.

61
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:53,280
You can do away with some of
your formalities.

62
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:56,760
You can announce your trip to
outer space in Moscow.

63
00:04:56,760 --> 00:05:00,800
Many noble people who understand
OZ live in Moscow.

64
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,310
Huh?

65
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:04,220
They should be able
to assist you.

66
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,650
Sir!

67
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:14,400
The radar hasn't
picked up anything.

68
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:16,350
That doesn't mean a damn thing.

69
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:18,120
Spread out and look
out for enemies.

70
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,750
Crap, I can't see a thing
in this sandstorm!

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,750
What could be in a
place like this?

72
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:29,480
There's a base belonging to the
middle east nations..

73
00:05:29,480 --> 00:05:32,200
...unassociated with the Earth
Sphere Alliance or OZ.

74
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:34,200
Why don't we take refuge there?

75
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,130
A base?

76
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,750
No problems here.

77
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,090
No problems here either.

78
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:38,960
None here.

79
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,680
I understand.

80
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:45,390
An underground base?!

81
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:52,190
Let's go.

82
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:55,800
H‐Hey!

83
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,030
This base belongs to our
homeland the Maguanac Corps' .

84
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,850
It's your base?

85
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:12,760
Good of you to come, Quatre.

86
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:16,090
It's been a while,
Commander Sadaul.

87
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,600
The missions have been tough
since you got to Earth,
haven't they?

88
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:23,230
Well, I owe the Maguanac Corps
for all their help.

89
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:25,230
I don't know how to thank you.

90
00:06:25,230 --> 00:06:28,780
It was their personal decision;
they wanted to help you.

91
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,150
If only we had more strength we
would've been able to...

92
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,550
...do a lot more damage to
the OZ organization.

93
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,550
That troublesome OZ!

94
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:38,810
Using the colonies as a shield
is irresponsible!

95
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,290
We're to blame, for
failing to stop them.

96
00:06:41,290 --> 00:06:43,850
Yeah, we're totally to blame.

97
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,850
Oh, no, Quatre.

98
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:48,280
No one is in a position
to blame you.

99
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,880
Here, come this way.

100
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:53,820
Master Quatre, we'll get started
with the mobile suit repairs.

101
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:55,260
Yeah, thanks.

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,720
Oh, and Rashid...

103
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,870
Yes, I know.

104
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,490
We will take care of
both Gundams.

105
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,030
That's ok, isn't it?

106
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:04,030
Just fine by me.

107
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,640
I appreciate your help.

108
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:08,120
I haven't introduced myself.

109
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:11,200
My name is Quatre
Raberba Winner.

110
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,380
Winner?

111
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:15,180
You mean you're the heir to
the Winner family?

112
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,890
One of the few influential and
financial powers of the
Arabic Nations?

113
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,300
No wonder everybody looks up to
you around this place.

114
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,540
Our family were all pacifists.

115
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,200
I've disinherited myself
to come out here.

116
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,120
Yeah?

117
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,350
It takes all types, I guess.

118
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,730
I'm Duo. Duo Maxwell.

119
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:37,680
I might run and hide, but I
never tell a lie. That's me
in a nut shell.

120
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,190
We were told that the colonies
have sent mobile suits to Earth.

121
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:51,310
That's her!

122
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:53,580
It's true that a number of
mobile suits...

123
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:56,080
...were sent to Earth and took
part in an attempt...

124
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,790
..to destroy certain targets.

125
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:01,120
However, OZ is presently taking
steps to expose the rebels...

126
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,120
...in order to
maintain world peace.

127
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,350
It's only a matter of time
before we solve this issue.

128
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,810
That rose doesn't
suit her one bit!

129
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:24,350
Thank you.

130
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,350
My pleasure.

131
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,640
My, isn't she cute!

132
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:36,060
Excuse me.

133
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:37,850
Do you have an invitation?

134
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,750
No.

135
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:43,320
Forgive me Miss, but this party
is open only to invited guests.

136
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:46,140
Hmmm? Katrina...

137
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:49,720
Well, do you know any
other guests?

138
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,710
Relena, you're early.

139
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,450
Marquis Weridge!

140
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:58,320
I'm terribly sorry; I had
absolutely no idea she was a
relation of yours.

141
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,580
Not to worry.

142
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,080
Shall we go, Relena?

143
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,810
The party's about to begin.

144
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:11,020
Thank you...

145
00:09:11,020 --> 00:09:12,220
Don't mention it.

146
00:09:12,250 --> 00:09:13,980
This place is full of old folks.

147
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,240
Young people like
yourself are a rarity.

148
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:19,800
My, Mr. Weridge.

149
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,210
What a pretty young date.

150
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,790
How do you do. I'm Relena.

151
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,250
May I have this dance
please miss?

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,670
I couldn't allow that.

153
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:30,670
The first dance is
already taken.

154
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,730
If you wouldn't mind, could I
have this dance, dear?

155
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:36,970
Why should I mind; I'd
be delighted.

156
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,830
It would be my pleasure.

157
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,370
Huh? What's this?!

158
00:09:41,370 --> 00:09:43,370
We're guarding the
front entrance.

159
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,430
Nothing to report at the rear
gate or along the channel.

160
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:48,720
Radar picking up
nothing in the sky.

161
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:49,420
Roger.

162
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,800
Continuing to post guard.

163
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,400
Hmm...

164
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:54,620
Relena, I can see the
Peacecraft influence in you.

165
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:58,030
Do you know the Peacecrafts?

166
00:09:58,300 --> 00:09:59,680
Yes, of course I do.

168
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:05,480
Thank you.

169
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,120
Yes, I was very close indeed
with the Peacecrafts...

170
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:12,120
...the monarchy of the
Sanc Kingdom.

171
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,280
Till 13 years ago, when the
family was overthrown.

172
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:18,330
Why was the Peacecraft
family overthrown, Sir?

173
00:10:18,330 --> 00:10:21,690
It seems absurd, but while some
people hope for peace...

174
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:23,690
...others try to gain
through disputes.

175
00:10:23,930 --> 00:10:26,270
The former was the
Peacecraft family...

176
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:29,130
...and the latter was the United
Earth Sphere Alliance.

177
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,640
So you mean their talk of
peace interfered

178
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:33,340
with the Alliance's objectives?

179
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:35,500
Yes, and even the
Romefeller Foundation...

180
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:38,750
...who had differences with the
Alliance, started
developing weapons.

I invited Treize today to
personally ask what he was
trying to pull off.

184
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,080
But he sent some representative!

185

Show me to Marquis Weridge.

I must see him personally, on
behalf of His Excellency.

things with you.

Of course, before that, would
you give me that rose of yours?

Grandfather, roses just don't
look good on me either.

Not to mention our
objective to destroy OZ.

OZ destroyed peace in
the colonies.

intention of fighting.

perfect role model.

a stubborn streak in him.

It was clear the colonies were
targeted once the
Gundams got going.

A battle where the nation is not
unified as one body.

What do you think, Rashid?

00:15:08,246 --> 00:15:10,976
If we start fighting here, the
civilians will get involved.

by at the village...

We're here for
precautionary purposes.

Well?

296
00:16:04,096 --> 00:16:05,266
We can't move it.

297
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,566
It's set so any movement
will trigger it.

298
00:16:08,116 --> 00:16:09,406
Rashid, what's the matter?

299
00:16:09,406 --> 00:16:10,606
Master. Quatre

300
00:16:10,606 --> 00:16:11,926
OZ played dumb.

301
00:16:11,926 --> 00:16:15,246
And the whole time they were
setting twenty bombs
all over town!

302
00:16:15,246 --> 00:16:15,696
Huh?!

303
00:16:15,696 --> 00:16:18,356
If they're time bombs we just
need to trash them all!

304
00:16:18,846 --> 00:16:20,766
They're designed so we
can't move them.

305
00:16:20,766 --> 00:16:23,556
They've narrowed our troops'
location down to this town.

306
00:16:23,556 --> 00:16:26,446
Which means they're gonna
force us to surface.

307
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:29,456
They've set the bombs to go
off at 12 midnight.

308
00:16:29,686 --> 00:16:31,856
They must be hoping for a
nighttime battle.

309
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:35,426
It would seem OZ is preparing to
battle with us overnight.

310
00:16:35,426 --> 00:16:38,526
Or else they think we're gonna
surrender before then.

311
00:16:38,726 --> 00:16:41,296
Aren't the Gundams
causing this problem?

312
00:16:41,936 --> 00:16:42,916
That's right!

313
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,606
I'm sure it's us they're after.

314
00:16:44,606 --> 00:16:47,136
Their attack is very
well thought out.

315
00:16:47,136 --> 00:16:50,246
They've probably been watching
this town for quite some time.

316
00:16:51,966 --> 00:16:53,536
Everyone, listen up!

317
00:16:53,536 --> 00:16:56,606
OZ has discovered this town and
will be attacking.

318
00:16:56,786 --> 00:16:59,926
I doubt if we'll be able to
deceive them any further.

319
00:17:00,246 --> 00:17:03,086
Therefore, we'll aim at one area
of their barricade...

320
00:17:03,086 --> 00:17:05,796
...and resist their attack while
the civilians escape!

321
00:17:06,096 --> 00:17:08,736
One other honorable
duty remains.

322
00:17:08,886 --> 00:17:12,046
We must get the two Gundams
suits out of the vicinity.

323
00:17:12,406 --> 00:17:16,386
The Gundams are heroes that
arrived on Earth to destroy OZ!

324
00:17:16,386 --> 00:17:20,676
Because of OZ's scheming, the
Gundams will not be able to
fight this battle.

325
00:17:20,756 --> 00:17:25,426
However, there will be a day
when the Gundams will
save us all!

326
00:17:25,426 --> 00:17:28,606
Be thankful that you can return
the favor in advance!

327
00:17:28,606 --> 00:17:30,006
Do you understand?!

328
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,356
[CROWD:] YEAH!

329
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,286
All troops, to battle!

330
00:17:53,487 --> 00:17:56,077
Hover suits from the middle east
troops are attacking!

331
00:17:56,077 --> 00:17:58,077
Tragos troops, fire!!

332
00:18:07,327 --> 00:18:09,357
The enemy's hover suits
are too quick!

333
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,767
Tragos Hover suits,
shift to the back!

334
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:13,307
Close combat's too dangerous!

335
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:14,287
Yes, sir!

336
00:18:27,247 --> 00:18:30,167
Tragos ready to fire at
enemy's underground exit!

337
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:32,167
Huh? What's going on?!

338
00:18:34,477 --> 00:18:36,937
Did you think that was
our only exit?!

339
00:18:46,267 --> 00:18:47,207
Found them!

340
00:18:47,597 --> 00:18:48,687
By the North Gate!

341
00:18:48,777 --> 00:18:50,937
There are lots of enemy
carriers to choose from!

342
00:18:51,177 --> 00:18:52,087
Good job.

343
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:53,487
Take them all at once.

344
00:18:53,547 --> 00:18:54,367
Yes sir!

345
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:55,527
Do not rush.

346
00:18:55,527 --> 00:18:57,197
Go to the North Mountain Gate.

347
00:18:57,197 --> 00:18:59,547
Do not get separated from
your families!

348
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:05,447
Go with this to the North Gate,
where Abdul's waiting.

349
00:19:05,547 --> 00:19:06,287
Thank you.

350
00:19:06,647 --> 00:19:08,857
Sorry I can't do
anything in return.

351
00:19:09,007 --> 00:19:11,227
I'm so ashamed, I could die!

352
00:19:12,427 --> 00:19:13,287
Huh?

353
00:19:13,597 --> 00:19:15,007
For me? Wow!

354
00:19:15,147 --> 00:19:17,117
The Gundams are our heroes!

355
00:19:17,117 --> 00:19:18,537
Never forget that.

356
00:19:18,617 --> 00:19:21,117
I know we'll fight together
again some day!

357
00:19:21,247 --> 00:19:22,487
For the future!

358
00:19:24,447 --> 00:19:25,847
Hey, Quatre!

359
00:19:26,527 --> 00:19:27,307
Yeah?

360
00:19:27,307 --> 00:19:29,967
I've got some flowers
here for you!

361
00:19:30,287 --> 00:19:31,307
I promise!

362
00:19:31,627 --> 00:19:34,507
One day my Gundam will
definitely fight again.

363
00:19:35,067 --> 00:19:39,287
Decoy operations are now
complete and we are
retreating to the hills!

364
00:19:42,857 --> 00:19:45,207
We cannot have
civilian casualties.

365
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:48,047
It would blemish the
Maguanac Corps name!

366
00:19:48,557 --> 00:19:51,677
Secure a path for Master
Quatre's carrier immediately!

367
00:20:09,247 --> 00:20:11,807
All Maguanac Corps,
gather up ahead!

368
00:20:11,807 --> 00:20:14,567
Do not let the enemy
through the barrage!

369
00:20:15,677 --> 00:20:16,717
Quatre...

370
00:20:16,767 --> 00:20:17,327
Yes?

371
00:20:17,387 --> 00:20:20,217
Could you circle the
sky just once?

372
00:20:21,247 --> 00:20:22,857
I can't help them now.

373
00:20:23,147 --> 00:20:25,417
But I still wanna do something.

374
00:20:26,537 --> 00:20:27,337
Sure thing.

375
00:20:36,137 --> 00:20:37,367
Hang in there!

376
00:20:37,367 --> 00:20:38,827
Keep firing!!

377
00:20:40,247 --> 00:20:41,517
Master Quatre...

378
00:20:47,657 --> 00:20:49,847
Good! Mission complete!

379
00:20:50,047 --> 00:20:53,417
Maguanac soldiers,
retreat at once!

380
00:21:03,517 --> 00:21:06,267
See you again, Maguanac Corps.

381
00:21:06,267 --> 00:21:10,857
The next time we meet, I'll make
sure the colonies'
thoughts are united.

382
00:21:11,307 --> 00:21:12,527
Count on it!

383
00:21:17,417 --> 00:21:18,647
There she is!

384
00:21:26,717 --> 00:21:28,347
Silly girl! Keep still!

385
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:29,887
Let me go!!

386
00:21:30,047 --> 00:21:30,767
Who are you?!

387
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:33,407
I'll be taking care of
her from now on.

388
00:21:33,407 --> 00:21:35,337
We have special orders
from Colonel Une.

389
00:21:35,337 --> 00:21:37,337
I can't take orders from you,
Lieutenant.

390
00:21:38,937 --> 00:21:40,667
[GUN SHOTS]

391
00:21:41,647 --> 00:21:45,647
If you are concerned about
authority, these orders are
from His Excellency.

392
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:47,307
You satisfied?

393
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:48,107
Yes, Lieutenant.

394
00:21:48,107 --> 00:21:49,757
Excuse our misunderstanding!

395
00:21:57,017 --> 00:21:58,697
You're being reckless.

396
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:01,327
I wonder who your
temperament takes after.

397
00:22:01,647 --> 00:22:03,387
You're part of OZ. aren't you?

398
00:22:10,967 --> 00:22:12,127
So who are you?

399
00:22:13,167 --> 00:22:15,017
I have come to help you.

400
00:22:15,387 --> 00:22:17,177
Miss Relena Peacecraft.

401
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:24,537

[NARRATOR:] The Gundams must use
weapons to win back peace.

404
00:23:42,057 --> 00:23:44,767
In a battlefield filled with
inconsistencies...

405
00:23:44,767 --> 00:23:46,767
...Wu Fei meets Sally Po.

406
00:23:48,407 --> 00:23:51,177
Wu Fei states that the weaker
should not be fighting.

407
00:23:51,177 --> 00:23:52,267
But with those words...

408
00:23:52,287 --> 00:23:55,387
...Sally senses the complexity
of a cornered warrior.

409
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,167
Still lost in his emotions,

410
00:23:57,167 --> 00:24:00,057
Wu Fei once again get
into his Gundam.
