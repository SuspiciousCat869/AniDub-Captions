17
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,320
We've heard everything
you have to say

18
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:08,320
I'd like you to leave the room
now, Vice Foreign Minister

19
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:11,300
Isn't it about time you
people realized,

20
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,760
the ones posing the most threat
are none other than yourselves

21
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:16,900
Silence we've had enough!

22
00:02:17,380 --> 00:02:18,980
Heero!

23
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:24,040
I'm right over here so
come and kill me!!

<i>Minister Darlian.</i>

26
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,520
I hope this'll be a very
successful trip for you.

27
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,120
Nothing wrong with a little
socializing now is there?

28
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,200
I can't imagine having anything
appropriate to discuss with a
specials officer.

29
00:03:22,740 --> 00:03:24,760
Pretty nasty words Minister.

30
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,500
I'm just here on orders
from my superiors.

31
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,280
I'd appreciate it if you didn’t
take your
frustrations out on me.

32
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:34,360
Relena look carefully.

33
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:39,160
<i>Never forget how beautiful the</i>
<i>earth looks from afar.</i>

34
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,060
Get a good look cause you will
never see it again.

35
00:03:54,740 --> 00:03:58,000
What are you sighing about; is
there something bothering you?

36
00:03:58,660 --> 00:04:02,460
I was just thinking the colonies
are in the middle of a
beautiful sea of stars.

37
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,740
And yet they don't even
seem to sparkle.

38
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,860
don't you agree?

39
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:09,100
No. I don't agree
with you at all.

40
00:04:09,380 --> 00:04:11,880
Relena's on the colonies
this very moment.

41
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,840
they should be sparkling much
brighter than usual.

42
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:26,800
Target is North Pacific Ocean,
OZ supply base.

43
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,540
Roger that mission.

44
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:53,720
Mr. Darlian! How
nice to see you.

45
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:57,420
I take it rumors of Earth's
chronic financial
crisis are false.

46
00:04:57,860 --> 00:05:01,760
otherwise you couldn't afford to
launch a shuttle for
yourself yes?

47
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,060
I truly wish that were
the only rumor.

48
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,360
The latest fase rumors spreading
throughout the Alliance...

49
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,840
...are much more grave.

50
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:12,520
You mean the rumors we were
planning an attack
against earth?

51
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,160
Where would the Alliance
get that idea?

52
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,880
Nothing good could come from
our attacking them.

53
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:21,900
The purpose of this visit is to
find out for ourselves...

54
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,720
... wether those rumors
are accurate.

55
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,920
Let's hope there's no
truth to that.

56
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:43,480
Relena: The people in the
colonies are so peacful
and courteous.

57
00:05:43,920 --> 00:05:47,320
How could people on Earth
believe that the colonies would
want to start a war.

58
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,840
How could they?

59
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:56,220
Excuse me, Miss Une.

60
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:00,320
You don't have diplomatic
authorization from Earth.

61
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,180
Please understand that I can not
allow you to sit in on
this meeting.

62
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,080
I understand.

63
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,920
But I'd still like to get the
report after you meet.

64
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:10,000
Of course.

65
00:06:10,140 --> 00:06:12,260
Fine. I'll excuse myself.

66
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:26,240
Ten minutes.

67
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,640
That's when it all ends; or
should I say when it begins.

68
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:39,760
It's Relena.

69
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,760
what is it?

70
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:43,760
I'm going out to do
some shopping.

71
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,280
<i>Darlian: Be careful</i>
<i>out there dear.</i>

72
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,720
I'll get you an escort.

73
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,740
No. i'm fine.

74
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:52,460
It's much safer here than it
is on the Earth.

75
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,700
Oh. She forgot it.

76
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,080
<i>Diplomat: These</i>
<i>accusations are unjust!</i>

77
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,980
<i>We've never even heard</i>
<i>of most of this.</i>

78
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,160
<i>Like Project Meteor or the new</i>

79
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:10,440
Mr. Darlian.

80
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,400
Why does the Alliance is finding
it so difficult to
believe in us?

81
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,780
Ten more seconds.

82
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:22,840
Excuse me, ma'am!

83
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,200
I think you forgot this
back in there.

84
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,360
You idiot!

85
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,640
[explosion]

86
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,740
Oh god, father!!

87
00:07:45,460 --> 00:07:46,740
That was a close call.

88
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:50,720
Go after the girl and kill her
if she tries to resist.

89
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:56,400
Father!

90
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,000
Where are you, father?!

91
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,300
Relena...

92
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:01,300
Father!!

93
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:03,300
Talk to me, father!

94
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,240
Is he alright?

95
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:06,881
Huh?

96
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:08,080
Well?!

97
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:10,560
I can't find any
other survivors.

98
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,120
Relena: Who are you people?!

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,780
Okay. we'll carry Mr.
Darlian out.

100
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:15,361
<i>Man: right!</i>

101
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,900
<i>OZ troop: Stop Right there!</i>

102
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,520
What are you doing?!

103
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:19,900
move!

104
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,420
Someone's taken Darlian's
daughter and they're
trying to escape.

105
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:31,080
Block all of the exits.

106
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,260
Let go of me!

107
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:33,920
you're gonna have to
come with us.

108
00:08:33,920 --> 00:08:36,400
It's the only way you'll make it
out of here alive.

109
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,400
I don't care what happens to me.

110
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,240
what are you going to do
with my father?!

111
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,980
Just do as we say for the
time being miss.

112
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,780
Get in!

113
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:57,900
Are you hurt lady Une?

114
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,460
This injection should
help you relax.

115
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,340
Get father to the hospital.

116
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,780
He will die for sure
unless you do.

117
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,000
The hospitals too risky!

118
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,060
What do you mean?

119
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,100
They're already guarding
the hospitals.

120
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:17,060
We have qualified doctors in
our organization.

121
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:18,680
Organization?

122
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,460
Who are you people anyway?

123
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,460
Relena...

124
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,840
Father...

125
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:27,260
Listen to me, Relena...

126
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:28,720
Don't try to talk!

127
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,260
You have got to lie still!

128
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,980
I have a confession
to make Relena.

129
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,700
I'm not your biological father.

130
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:36,600
huh?!

131
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,820
You've got to believe what
I'm telling you.

132
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,680
your real name is
Relena Peacecraft.

133
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:45,820
you're the daughter of the
Peacecraft family...

134
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:49,800
...that was so well known for
it's total commitment
to pacifism.

135
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,980
wha... I don't know what
you're saying?

136
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,640
I am a member of the senate that
served their country
in the past.

137
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:00,160
But long ago the kingdom was
demolished by the Alliance.

138
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,800
And I decided to take you in as
my daughter when I
made my escape.

139
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:05,640
Father that's not possible.

140
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,500
Relena...

141
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:08,640
watch out for the OZ
organization.

142
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:14,380
Don't die on me, no father!

143
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,380
No!!

144
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:23,400
The medication's working.

145
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,920
She's deep asleep.

146
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,960
The mobile suit has
been repaired.

147
00:10:40,280 --> 00:10:42,040
Thanks pal; I owe you one!

148
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,380
No problem, as long
as I get paid.

149
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,740
You're an excellent
client young man.

150
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,660
We made it just in time for
my next mission.

151
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,720
Do you really have to leave?

152
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,320
I won't stop you.

153
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:11,320
But at least tell me what your
name is before you go.

154
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,340
My name's Quatre Raberba Winner.

155
00:11:16,060 --> 00:11:17,080
I have no name.

156
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,580
But if you must call me
something, it's Trowa.

157
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:21,480
Call me Trowa Barton.

158
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,880
Goodbye friend Trowa.

159
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:25,980
We'll meet again.

160
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,520
Quatre...

161
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,520
Should we be letting
him go like this?

162
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:37,920
He knows the location of
this base after all.

163
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,560
I wouldn't worry.

164
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:42,340
He's not the type to go
around telling anyone.

165
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,260
But what if he attacks?

166
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,920
I almost wish he would.

167
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:48,320
Then at least I'd be able
to see him again.

168
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:07,900
‐Nothing to report
‐Roger!

169
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,300
What a drag; boring guard gaurd
duty for two whole hours.

170
00:12:20,420 --> 00:12:21,500
<i>Troop: Hey,</i>
<i>something the matter?</i>

171
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:24,180
No problems here.

172
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,720
Everything's in order.

173
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:38,160
Now I just have to get to the
targer point to carry
out my mission.

174

[♪♪]Gundam Wing

175
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,420
I'm counting on you, Otto.

176
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,040
Don't worry about a thing.

177
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,840
The staff here are
highly skilled.

178
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,440
I'll make sure it
gets completed.

179
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:04,640
Are you sure this 20 year‐old
suit is gonna be any use to us?

180
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,180
It's probably more advanced than
any OZ mobile suit...

181
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:09,660
...that's currently available.

182
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,620
You're kidding.

183
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:13,020
No way.

184
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,100
Think about it.

185
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,780
This Tallgeese suit is the
prototype for all mobile suits.

186
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:23,080
Even those Gundams were built
based on this Tallgeese design.

187
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:24,400
The Gundams?

188
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:34,360
Father!

189
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,480
You've woken up.

190
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,800
I'm terribly sorry
for your loss.

191
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,500
If only we'd become aware of the
situation earlier...

192
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,640
... We could have
avoided this tragedy.

She's making us out to be a
bunch of terrorists!

That's just what you are!

208
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,900
You let my father die because
you wouldn't take him to the...

... hospital in time.

That's enough.

I'm terribly sorry for

213

I'll get revenge for his death.

It's OZ right?

215
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:52,480
OZ is responsible for
killing my father right?

216
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:53,580
Don't be stupid!

217
00:14:53,580 --> 00:14:55,380
You'll just end up
getting killed!

Can't you see its suicide

219
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:59,740
I don't care if I do get killed.

<i>What do you wanna shoot him for?</i>

<i>No need to apologize Father.</i>

224

Now!

00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:25,160
Let go of me!

229
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,740
Are you talking about Heero Yuy?

230
00:15:30,020 --> 00:15:31,140
Do you know him?!

231
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,060
Do you know Heero Yuy?!

[chuckles]

233
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,520
That was some
performance by Lady Une.

234
00:15:39,840 --> 00:15:41,560
What happened to Mr. Darlian?

235
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:43,480
I believe he was killed.

236
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,800
Poor girl.

237
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,880
You're still worried aren't you?

238
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:52,460
Worried about what?

239
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,600
Open up Zechs.

240
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:01,180
You're hiding far too
many secrets.

241
00:16:14,220 --> 00:16:16,620
[explosion]

242
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:19,840
Commander!

243
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,680
We're reading an enormous
heat source...

244
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,840
... and two guard Leos
have disappeared!

245
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,680
Enemies?!

246
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,800
It looks like it might
be a Gundam sir!

247
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,960
Get all mobile suits ready
for combat at once!

248
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:30,780
Yes, sir!

249
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,380
Visibility is poor, I can't
confirm anything.

250
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:44,780
A Gundam!

251
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,720
Uaagh!!

252
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,040
Please feel free to call me Dr.
J, young lady.

253
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:05,900
Believe it or not,
I'm a scientist.

254
00:17:06,080 --> 00:17:06,980
Dr. J.

255
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:10,220
You're the one that sent Heero
to Earth, aren't you Doctor?

256
00:17:10,660 --> 00:17:11,960
Yes that's right.

257
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:14,240
But who in their right mind
would've thought that...

258
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,360
... he'd end up in the same
school as Darlian's daughter?!

259
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,880
How's that rascal doing anyway?

260
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,920
‐What a kid!
‐What are you trying to get him
to do on Earth?

261
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:27,560
I'll say this, That young lad
is an agent of ours.

262
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,620
An agent?

263
00:17:29,020 --> 00:17:32,000
<i>Since Heero was very young,</i>
<i>we've taught him...</i>

264
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,420
<i>... a wide range of</i>
<i>battle strategies.</i>

265
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,840
<i>We brought him up as a</i>
<i>professional assassin.</i>

266
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,760
<i>Relena: Why would you do</i>
<i>such a thing?!</i>

267
00:17:38,760 --> 00:17:39,820
<i>Don't you see?</i>

268
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,400
<i>For the peace of the colonies,</i>
<i>of course.</i>

269
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:43,780
The peace?

270
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,600
how in the world could killing
someone possibly lead
us to peace!

271
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,480
It leads directly to peace!

272
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:53,460
Wars are started by people and
they end with people.

273
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:58,000
Heero's ordered to attack the
dangerous, evil people...

274
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,420
...responsible for
starting wars.

275
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:03,580
<i>But there must be more</i>
<i>peaceful solutions!</i>

276
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,480
<i>Twenty years ago, we</i>
<i>believed that ourselves.</i>

277
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:13,360
We thought humanity
couldn't be so foolish.

278
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:17,120
That no one could possibly
wish for a war.

279
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:24,760
<i>The colonies were started by</i>
<i>scientists like myself...</i>

280
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:26,300
<i>... and by laborers.</i>

281
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,720
<i>Our ancestors did everything</i>
<i>they could to form the colonies.</i>

282
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,520
<i>After over 100 years</i>
<i>of hard work...</i>

283
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:37,140
<i>... we could finally enjoy a</i>
<i>normal lifestyle there.</i>

284
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:39,820
<i>And exactly twenty years ago,</i>

285
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,500
<i>we were living peacefully...</i>

286
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,140
<i>... under the ruler of all</i>
<i>colonies, Heero Yuy.</i>

287
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,160
Heero Yuy?

288
00:18:47,160 --> 00:18:50,180
His name still lives on
today as a legend...

289
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,340
...among the residents
of our colonies.

290
00:18:52,780 --> 00:18:56,020
That's where we came up with the
young lad's code name you see.

291
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,420
His code name?

292
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:02,580
times of peace in the colonies
didn't last for long.

293
00:19:03,980 --> 00:19:08,100
<i>I suppose they felt a leader</i>
<i>promoting peace was</i>
<i>too dangerous.</i>

294
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,780
<i>Heero Yuy was assassinated by</i>
<i>some organization.</i>

295
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,200
<i>From that point, communication</i>
<i>ceased between the colonies...</i>

296
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,660
<i>... and this became an excuse to</i>
<i>strengthen the</i>
<i>Alliance Military.</i>

297
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:24,640
you see, OZ was responsible for
Heero Yuy's assassination...

298
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:26,740
... and wanted a war with Earth.

299
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:27,880
OZ?!

300
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,540
Do you know OZ?

301
00:19:29,800 --> 00:19:31,800
That was the last
thing father said.

302
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,560
To watch out for OZ.

303
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,180
So who are you making
Heero fight against?

304
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,680
All of OZ.

305
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,940
We must stop them before they
fulfill their ambitions...

306
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,080
...to take over the United
Alliance Military...

307
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,980
... and dictate the Earth Sphere.

308
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,760
But, why does Heero have to take
on that enormous task?

309
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:53,120
Why should he be responsible for
doing all that by himself?

310
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:55,320
We have no choice!

311
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,780
He understands the emotional
pains that the colony
residents...

312
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:01,060
... have been forced to
endure over the years.

313
00:20:01,060 --> 00:20:02,440
But still...!

314
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:20,500
It looks like we're both
after the same thing.

315
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,020
Well, aren't you gonna at
least respond?

316
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:32,580
Locked on target.

317
00:20:36,340 --> 00:20:40,340
Seems like the two of us are
gonna have to fight it
out after all.

318
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,360
They should be able to return
you safely to Earth from here.

319
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,880
May I ask you why you saved
my life Dr. J.?

320
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,100
Is it Because of my father?

321
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,660
Because I'm Darlian's daughter?

322
00:20:58,980 --> 00:20:59,900
Not at all.

323
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:03,120
It's because you had the same
look in your eyes as Heero did.

324
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,380
That genuine expression.

325
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:08,940
Heero's actually a
kind‐hearted young boy.

326
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:12,960
Yes I know that.

327
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,400
But Heero's very dedicated
to his mission.

328
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,600
Stay away from him if you
value your life.

329
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:39,380
Aah!!

330
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:50,800
I've returned the favor.

331
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:53,480
[laughs]

332
00:21:58,380 --> 00:21:59,140
Damn you!

333
00:21:59,300 --> 00:22:00,520
I'll get you back!

334
00:22:06,620 --> 00:22:07,240
<i>Father...</i>

335
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:09,240
<i>I'll always be your daughter.</i>

336
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,580
