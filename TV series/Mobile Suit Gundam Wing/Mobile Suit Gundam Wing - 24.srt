[THEME MUSIC]

2
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,176
[NARRATOR:] In the year
After Colony 175,

3
00:01:32,176 --> 00:01:34,720
the leader of the colonies
was assassinated.

4
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,821
Five Gundams were supposed to have
been sent to Earth

5
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:38,850
to take
revenge.

6
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,601
However, since OZ's
activities in space

7
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:44,938
took the form of cooperation,
rather than control,

8
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,985
the colonies decided to accept OZ.

9
00:01:48,985 --> 00:01:51,905
In the year After Colony 195,

10
00:01:51,905 --> 00:01:55,491
As OZ moves to take over
both the Earth and outer space,

11
00:01:55,491 --> 00:02:00,788
the Gundams are labeled as rebels
and are isolated from society.

12
00:02:00,788 --> 00:02:03,040
With no place to return,

13
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,001
the Gundams and their pilots are

14
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:07,378
forced to fight for
a reason to exist

15
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:10,965
in the ever‐changing world.

16
00:02:10,965 --> 00:02:15,886
What’s going on?

17
00:02:15,886 --> 00:02:17,346
They missed it!

18
00:02:17,346 --> 00:02:19,223
Was that intentional?

19
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:23,561
Milliardo, there's one other
person who understands me.

20
00:02:23,561 --> 00:02:27,481
Her feelings toward me have caused
her to have split personalities.

21
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,485
The actions you took were
right on the mark.

22
00:02:30,485 --> 00:02:36,073
But then again, what I'm about
to do is also on the mark!

23
00:02:36,073 --> 00:02:39,128
[NARRATOR:] Duo, God of
Death Once Again

24
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,630
[MILITIA SOLDIER:] We're
adjusting the ballast.

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:53,883
Proceed slowly. Easy does it.

26
00:02:53,883 --> 00:02:54,716
[SALLY PO:] Wait.

27
00:02:54,716 --> 00:02:56,970
Get some light on these rocks!

28
00:02:56,970 --> 00:02:58,004
There it is!

29
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,690
It's hardly even damaged,

30
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:06,686
considering
the battle it's been through.

31
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:08,105
[MILITIA SOLDIER:] Major Sally.

32
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:10,566
Some vessels are approaching us,
Sally.

33
00:03:10,566 --> 00:03:12,818
This was just Heero's trick,

34
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,905
discarding his Gundam into the sea
while he heads into space alone.

35
00:03:15,905 --> 00:03:17,531
A mobile suit submarine carrier!

36
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,866
It’s natural that OZ
would come here too.

37
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,493
It's a dangerous job.

38
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,871
Don't concern yourself
about us militia men.

39
00:03:23,871 --> 00:03:27,416
We’ve got our expertise as the
former Alliance's deep‐sea unit!

40
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:32,005
Prepare to send out
the Pisces now!

41
00:03:32,005 --> 00:03:33,798
Something showing on screen!

42
00:03:33,798 --> 00:03:35,675
Perhaps 01.

43
00:03:35,675 --> 00:03:37,260
Right, send out the Cancers!

44
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,210
[OZ SOLDIERS:] Yes, sir!

45
00:03:49,396 --> 00:03:53,985
All units, open fire!

46
00:03:53,985 --> 00:03:55,778
Propeller sound confirmed!

47
00:03:55,778 --> 00:03:57,405
Enemy mobiles!

48
00:03:57,405 --> 00:03:58,283
They’re what?

49
00:04:14,171 --> 00:04:16,601
Cancer! Cancer! Come in!

50
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:26,169
[EXPLOSIONS]

51
00:04:40,698 --> 00:04:43,075
What on Earth could he
have been thinking?

52
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,911
Discarding his Gundam like that.

53
00:04:45,911 --> 00:04:47,038
[SALLY] Heero.

54
00:04:47,038 --> 00:04:50,660
The foundation of our future will
be built by these mobile suits.

55
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:58,173
[TUBAROV:] These are for
mass production.

56
00:04:58,173 --> 00:05:00,593
But don't concern yourself
with cost performance.

57
00:05:00,593 --> 00:05:03,011
Resources in space are unlimited!

58
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,390
What? He’s treating the
Space Colonies

59
00:05:05,390 --> 00:05:08,266
as if they were true colonies
to be taken advantage of!

60
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,393
Let him be.

61
00:05:09,393 --> 00:05:11,395
We'll give him
something to remember.

62
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,230
I'm counting on you.

63
00:05:13,230 --> 00:05:15,941
Leave it to me.

64
00:05:15,941 --> 00:05:18,276
Where do you think you’re
taking that to?

65
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,780
It's the Gundam you took apart
to try and steal our technology.

66
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,823
We're honored.

67
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:24,720
I’m surprised you’re still
interested

68
00:05:24,888 --> 00:05:26,785
in it even after
reducing it to scrap.

69
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,120
How dare you!

70
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,705
I’ve got no need for it!

71
00:05:29,705 --> 00:05:31,123
Hurry up and get rid of it!

72
00:05:31,123 --> 00:05:33,761
[PROFESSOR G:] As you wish, Mr.
Chief Engineer.

73
00:05:37,213 --> 00:05:39,635
Well now, shall I go on with
making a

74
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:42,093
mobile suit superior to the
Gundams?

75
00:05:42,093 --> 00:05:43,093
[TUBAROV] Get to work!

76
00:05:43,093 --> 00:05:44,428
[DOCTOR J:] Calm down now!

77
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:45,805
Quit rushing me!

78
00:05:45,805 --> 00:05:48,846
I've got a whole bunch of things
to take care of right now.

79
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,525
Sorry to keep you.

80
00:05:57,525 --> 00:06:00,246
Yes, there is no point in
just rebuilding them.

81
00:06:05,408 --> 00:06:07,326
[MILLARDO:] You didn't use
to have any problems

82
00:06:07,326 --> 00:06:09,995
with your principles
against war in space.

83
00:06:09,995 --> 00:06:12,873
So why is there a need
for armaments now?

84
00:06:12,873 --> 00:06:14,750
A century has passed
since the times

85
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,836
when the colonies were merely
experimental establishments.

86
00:06:17,836 --> 00:06:19,913
We’ve determined there's no choice

87
00:06:20,081 --> 00:06:22,466
but to avoid battle by arming
ourselves.

88
00:06:22,466 --> 00:06:23,938
[DELEGATE:] This is Sally Po,

89
00:06:24,106 --> 00:06:26,303
formerly a
Major with the Alliance Military.

90
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:29,765
As an active member of a rebel
organization member opposing OZ,

91
00:06:29,765 --> 00:06:32,351
she has supported and led a
number of their maneuvers.

92
00:06:32,351 --> 00:06:35,813
She may also have the
Gundam 01 and 04.

93
00:06:35,813 --> 00:06:38,148
The Romefeller Foundation
that controls OZ

94
00:06:38,148 --> 00:06:40,400
is the most powerful
entity on the Earth.

95
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:43,486
I'd say there are problems
with that organization.

96
00:06:43,486 --> 00:06:46,323
However, we wanted to
protect the colonies.

97
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:47,991
And that's why we've accepted OZ.

98
00:06:47,991 --> 00:06:50,190
We had to decide on the choice
that would

99
00:06:50,358 --> 00:06:51,578
give us the most
safety.

100
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:53,831
Armed struggle will
continue on Earth.

101
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,096
That struggle has lead us to
choose

102
00:06:56,265 --> 00:06:58,335
this method to protect ourselves.

103
00:06:58,335 --> 00:07:01,671
Those on Earth opposing OZ
think that OZ themselves,

104
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:03,800
who are keeping the Gundam
engineers captive,

105
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,630
are the only ones who are changing
this world

106
00:07:06,798 --> 00:07:08,678
into a dangerous place to
live.

107
00:07:08,678 --> 00:07:10,430
We've received word those
engineers

108
00:07:10,598 --> 00:07:11,890
have already been executed.

109
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,268
We cannot maintain our
dignity as a nation

110
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:15,853
unless we augment our strength

111
00:07:15,853 --> 00:07:18,688
and eliminate the possibility of
encountering even more rebels.

112
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:20,483
Our decision is not
going to change.

113
00:07:20,483 --> 00:07:22,235
Listen, Ambassador Peacecraft.

114
00:07:22,235 --> 00:07:25,278
Please try to understand
our reasoning.

115
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,656
[MILLARDO:] The engineers
have been executed?

116
00:07:27,656 --> 00:07:29,741
That's impossible.

117
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:34,853
It's this kind of unmitigated
rumor

118
00:07:35,021 --> 00:07:38,835
that we must fear the most.

119
00:07:38,835 --> 00:07:40,900
[NEWSCASTER:] In addition, natural
resources

120
00:07:41,068 --> 00:07:42,463
and parts have been
transported

121
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:46,133
from the respective plant colonies
as we prepare for mass production

122
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:48,551
of the latest mobile suits
on the Lunar Plant,

123
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:50,555
together with support from OZ.

124
00:07:50,555 --> 00:07:53,723
We no longer fear the
possibility of an invasion.

125
00:07:53,723 --> 00:07:57,143
With the help of Commander‐
in‐Chief Treize and Colonel Une,

126
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:59,021
this will surely prove to
be the beginning

127
00:07:59,021 --> 00:08:01,148
of a new era for outer space.

128
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:02,483
What BS.

129
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:06,278
It was them who planted the fear
of war in you in the first place.

130
00:08:06,278 --> 00:08:08,196
[HILDE:] That's not true.

131
00:08:08,196 --> 00:08:11,741
The colonies have suffered a
history of humiliation up til now.

132
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:14,141
We aren't afraid of any battles
that will allow

133
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,038
the colonies to pick themselves
up.

134
00:08:16,038 --> 00:08:17,038
[DUO:] Who are you?

135
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,706
[HILDE:] My name is
Hilde Schbeiker.

136
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:20,960
I've volunteered my
services from this colony.

137
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:23,503
[DUO:] Oh, I get it,
you're an OZ soldier.

138
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,756
It’s easy for anyone to criticize.

139
00:08:25,756 --> 00:08:28,633
The work of the colony's
students speaks for itself.

140
00:08:28,633 --> 00:08:30,595
[HILDE:] Our volunteer work
at the Lunar Plant

141
00:08:30,595 --> 00:08:34,306
best reflects our faith in OZ.
Keep that in mind!

142
00:08:34,306 --> 00:08:36,600
Wow. Is that so?

143
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,980
Then maybe I should apply as well.

144
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:43,440
The next military exam
is in one week.

145
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,852
Hey, why don't you give it a
try if you like?

146
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:57,455
Count on it, baby, I'll be there.

147
00:08:57,455 --> 00:09:01,625
[WUFEI:] We're headed to
the Lunar Base.

148
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:04,920
Are they using us as test
pilots for the new models?

149
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:06,713
Maybe a target for them.

150
00:09:06,713 --> 00:09:09,014
Even OZ admits we're
pretty lively.

151
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,973
[TROWA:] I’m certain the
objective of OZ

152
00:09:15,973 --> 00:09:18,600
and its mother organization,
the Romefeller Foundation,

153
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,103
was to destroy the
United Earth Sphere Alliance

154
00:09:21,103 --> 00:09:24,356
and take control of the Earth.

155
00:09:24,356 --> 00:09:27,150
Why don't they simply take
over the colonies?

156
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:29,073
Taking over the defenseless
colonies

157
00:09:29,241 --> 00:09:30,946
should be no more difficult to OZ

158
00:09:30,946 --> 00:09:33,865
than twisting a baby's arm.

159
00:09:33,865 --> 00:09:36,243
Maybe Zechs would be able
to understand.

160
00:09:36,243 --> 00:09:38,870
[WUFEI:] Treize is getting
hungry for mortal combat.

161
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:41,706
And the overconfident
colonies will soon realize

162
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:44,710
just how much stronger
Treize really is.

163
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,150
[OZ INTERCOM:] All soldiers
prepare to

164
00:09:46,318 --> 00:09:47,211
board ship on the double!

165
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,597
All soldiers prepare to
board ship on the double!

166
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:55,303
We’ll confirm the boosters
and the checklist, and then...

167
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:58,848
[DUO:] Here you go, sir.

168
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,141
Okay.

169
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:01,351
Have a nice day.

170
00:10:01,351 --> 00:10:03,811
[HILDE:] Hey you!
Stop right there!

171
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,188
I know you!

172
00:10:05,188 --> 00:10:07,316
What is it? Did you
want something?

173
00:10:07,316 --> 00:10:10,276
I told you that new volunteers
are to apply next week.

174
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:12,863
I want you to let me look at
that application!

175
00:10:12,863 --> 00:10:14,240
Oh, this?

176
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,658
It's all filled out.

177
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:17,759
But it's a fake!

178
00:10:22,288 --> 00:10:25,000
You scum!

179
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,128
[DUO:] Comin’ in!

180
00:10:28,128 --> 00:10:33,716
[OZ SOLDIER:] He's taken the Leo!
After him!

181
00:10:33,716 --> 00:10:35,468
Everyone stay calm!

182
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:41,433
I don't want to start firing this
thing inside the colony!

183
00:10:41,433 --> 00:10:42,850
You won't get away!

184
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:51,860
My ultimate goal is to
destroy the Lunar Plant

185
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,946
but it's just too far
away from here.

186
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:56,531
[HILDE:] Stop right there!

187
00:10:56,531 --> 00:11:00,201
It’s her again!

188
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:01,948
[HILDE:] If you choose to
retaliate,

189
00:11:02,116 --> 00:11:03,121
I'll have to kill you!

190
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:06,916
Warning shots are meaningless from
those who’ve never even battled!

191
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:10,670
This one's for the peace
of the colony!

192
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:14,085
Hang on a second here, I’m
fighting for

193
00:11:14,253 --> 00:11:16,968
the peace of the colony as well!

194
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,261
Got him!

195
00:11:18,261 --> 00:11:22,015
[OZ SOLDIER:] We’ll move in
until it's in target range!

196
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:23,475
Good, fire!

197
00:11:23,475 --> 00:11:26,936
Sir!

198
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:27,813
Hey!

199
00:11:27,813 --> 00:11:30,273
We're both fighting for the
colonies, right?

200
00:11:30,273 --> 00:11:32,526
Then how is it we’ve
become enemies?

201
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:38,490
[HILDE:] Pleading for your life?

202
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,451
I'm telling you! You and I
aren't enemies!

203
00:11:41,451 --> 00:11:44,205
I volunteered and
pledged my loyalty.

204
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:46,831
I'm prepared to die any time!

205
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:51,295
You're so intense it
makes me sick!

206
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:52,958
[DUO:] Get outta here!

207
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,198
[HILDE:] Duo Maxwell.

208
00:12:20,198 --> 00:12:22,826
Who would've thought you
were a Gundam pilot?

209
00:12:22,826 --> 00:12:24,370
Why did you save me?

210
00:12:24,370 --> 00:12:26,288
What are you talking about?

211
00:12:26,288 --> 00:12:28,373
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life.

212
00:12:28,373 --> 00:12:30,750
I don't need sympathy
from my enemies.

213
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,753
Hilde, that’s your name?

214
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,130
What enemies do you mean?

215
00:12:35,130 --> 00:12:38,800
[DUO:] Since when is the colony
an organization fighting a war?

216
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,720
When the Alliance came from
Earth to attack the colonies,

217
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,640
the smiles disappeared from
people's faces.

218
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:48,518
I've been fighting to help give
back those smiles they lost.

219
00:12:48,518 --> 00:12:51,355
[DUO:] But then I come back to
the colony, and guess what?

220
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:53,773
The people don't want
their smiles back.

221
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,150
Tell me something.

222
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,945
When did the colonies
become so twisted?

223
00:12:57,945 --> 00:13:00,906
Outer space is affected
by war on Earth.

224
00:13:00,906 --> 00:13:04,201
We can't just sit back
and be taken over.

225
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:06,786
This is outer space's decision.

226
00:13:06,786 --> 00:13:09,248
Your bravery's commendable.

227
00:13:09,248 --> 00:13:11,666
So where are you gonna take me?

228
00:13:11,666 --> 00:13:13,085
To the Lunar Base.

229
00:13:13,085 --> 00:13:15,003
[HILDE:] You'll be
questioned on the Gundam,

230
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:15,880
among other things.

231
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:17,421
[DUO:] That saves me a trip.

232
00:13:17,421 --> 00:13:19,925
You know that I'm planning to
destroy the Lunar Base.

233
00:13:19,925 --> 00:13:21,260
You don't stand a chance.

234
00:13:21,260 --> 00:13:23,511
Why don't you think of
me as an enemy?

235
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,848
I’d never let you destroy
the Lunar Base.

236
00:13:25,848 --> 00:13:29,518
Hate to say this, but you don't
have the skills to be my enemy.

237
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:31,436
So it's foolish for
someone like you

238
00:13:31,436 --> 00:13:34,021
to even bother risking your
life against me.

239
00:13:34,021 --> 00:13:37,943
But you know, you remind me
of just how reckless I was

240
00:13:37,943 --> 00:13:41,030
when I went down to the
Earth to fight all on my own.

241
00:13:41,030 --> 00:13:42,488
Don't patronize me!

242
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:45,241
[DUO:] In fact, we're
both foolish.

243
00:13:45,241 --> 00:13:47,578
A soldier can get
killed at any time.

244
00:13:47,578 --> 00:13:50,538
We'll see lots of friends in
the colony lose their lives.

245
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,041
Let's live out our lives believing
in the paths we've chosen.

246
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,871
You've got to be at least that
foolish to make it as a soldier.

247
00:14:02,635 --> 00:14:04,845
Did he tell you anything?

248
00:14:04,845 --> 00:14:05,971
Not a word.

249
00:14:05,971 --> 00:14:07,640
I see.

250
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,390
Hey chief?

251
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:09,933
When we were fighting just now,

252
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,226
couldn't we have simply
fired a warning shot?

253
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:14,938
We have orders to kill
rebels when it’s necessary.

254
00:14:14,938 --> 00:14:16,606
That's what wars are about.

255
00:14:16,606 --> 00:14:19,443
Even if it means sacrificing
your own people?

256
00:14:19,443 --> 00:14:21,945
Officer Hilde.

257
00:14:21,945 --> 00:14:23,488
I feel bad about it.

258
00:14:23,488 --> 00:14:25,740
But soldiers always have
to be prepared

259
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,160
to die in order to fulfill
their missions.

260
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,703
[INTERCOM:] Unit Chief, we're
about to arrive at the Lunar Base.

261
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,455
Good.

262
00:14:31,455 --> 00:14:34,165
We'll take the shuttle to OZ's
military establishment.

263
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:35,716
We need to hand over the prisoner.

264
00:14:41,006 --> 00:14:45,135
[EXPLOSION]

265
00:14:45,135 --> 00:14:46,220
What happened?

266
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:48,221
[INTERCOM:] The third engine
has caught fire!

267
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:49,806
It looks like someone on
board was responsible.

268
00:14:49,806 --> 00:14:53,810
Could it be Duo?

269
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:57,856
And now, the getaway.

270
00:14:57,856 --> 00:15:00,733
Duo!

271
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,903
Hey, that was quick.

272
00:15:02,903 --> 00:15:04,446
You've got good instincts.

273
00:15:04,446 --> 00:15:06,115
I’m about to blow up the hatch.

274
00:15:06,115 --> 00:15:08,991
So step back if you don't
wanna get hurt.

275
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,504
You're gonna do what, Duo?

276
00:15:15,456 --> 00:15:17,882
Stop it, Duo! Duo!

277
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,405
[EXPLOSION]

278
00:15:32,933 --> 00:15:34,560
[CHIEF:] What was that explosion?

279
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:40,231
What's the matter?
Give me a report!

280
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:42,525
The mass balance device is busted!

281
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,611
This’ll get me seasick.

282
00:15:44,611 --> 00:15:46,085
Mobile dolls!

283
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,816
Don't you move!

284
00:16:20,355 --> 00:16:23,225
Talk about irony! I made
it to the moon.

285
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:40,375
I finally made it.

286
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:43,337
Not too bad a job, if I
do say so myself.

287
00:16:48,466 --> 00:16:51,136
Now hurry up and finish me off!

288
00:16:51,136 --> 00:16:54,170
Though I do hate the idea of
being killed by a machine!

289
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,326
What’s going on?

290
00:17:09,488 --> 00:17:10,655
You fool!

291
00:17:10,655 --> 00:17:12,950
Give your code to prove
you're an ally!

292
00:17:12,950 --> 00:17:14,066
You'll get killed!

293
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:24,711
I can't do that.

294
00:17:24,711 --> 00:17:27,797
There's no telling who my
allies are anymore.

295
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:35,555
Duo!

296
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:38,891
Hurry up and go and do what
you want to accomplish!

297
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,643
Hilde, do you mean that?

298
00:17:40,643 --> 00:17:44,353
I decided to live out my life,
believing in the path I’ve chosen!

299
00:17:49,528 --> 00:17:50,986
Sorry, Hilde.

300
00:17:50,986 --> 00:17:53,573
But this time I'm not gonna
be bailing you out!

301
00:17:53,573 --> 00:17:56,993
I told you, I'm already
prepared to die!

302
00:17:56,993 --> 00:17:58,888
Oh yeah, I remember.

303
00:18:04,918 --> 00:18:05,960
But Hilde...

304
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,782
If you’re gonna do it, just
don't die in vain.

305
00:18:13,635 --> 00:18:19,475
Oh, Duo. I won’t.

306
00:18:19,475 --> 00:18:22,143
[CHIEF:] Hilde! What
are you doing?

307
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,520
Drop your gun at once.

308
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,881
I've got a serious problem
with your conduct!

309
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:34,948
It's underground, interesting.

310
00:18:34,948 --> 00:18:37,700
I'll get to the plant
directly through this duct.

311
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,866
Hey, there he is!

312
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:45,265
Hey! Don't lose him!

[OZ SOLDIER:] We believe the
enemy has entered Area B6!

We're in pursuit!

00:18:55,426 --> 00:18:56,553
What is it?

317
00:18:56,553 --> 00:18:58,513
[OZ SOLDIER #2:] We have
word from a colony Unit Chief.

318
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:01,140
The enemy is trying to destroy
the mobile suit plant!

319
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:01,933
What?

320
00:19:01,933 --> 00:19:04,926
Get security underground to
stop him from entering!

321
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,785
What the heck? What is this?

322
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:24,496
[PROFESSOR G:] Who's there?

323
00:19:24,496 --> 00:19:27,000
The God of Death.

324
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,376
[PROFESSOR G:] That
makes four of them.

325
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,881
[DOCTOR J:] Are you here
to kill us, too?

326
00:19:32,881 --> 00:19:34,883
[PROFESSOR G:] Long time no see,
Duo.

327
00:19:34,883 --> 00:19:36,885
So it was you guys!

328
00:19:36,885 --> 00:19:38,553
Then those are...

329
00:19:38,553 --> 00:19:39,555
[PROFESSOR G:] That's right.

330
00:19:39,555 --> 00:19:41,055
They're new models.

331
00:19:41,055 --> 00:19:43,683
Duo, how would you like
to operate one?

332
00:19:43,683 --> 00:19:44,935
[DUO:] When will it be finished?

333
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,311
[PROFESSOR G:] In one month.

334
00:19:46,311 --> 00:19:49,438
You just make sure you
stay alive until it’s finished.

335
00:19:49,438 --> 00:19:53,068
If you do, you'll certainly have
your chance in the spotlight.

336
00:19:53,068 --> 00:19:55,070
[OZ SOLDIERS:] He came in here!
Hurry!

337
00:19:55,070 --> 00:19:57,280
You have got to make up
your mind quickly,

338
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,408
we can not have them
discovering this location.

339
00:20:00,408 --> 00:20:01,660
Gotcha.

340
00:20:01,660 --> 00:20:05,705
Okay, we'll do things
your way then!

341
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,581
[DUO:] Hurry up and get started!

342
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,458
Master O, could you do the honors?

343
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:13,130
As much as I hate to.

344
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:21,346
[PUNCHING]

345
00:20:21,346 --> 00:20:25,058
It wouldn't hurt as much if you
screamed out loud, you know.

346
00:20:25,058 --> 00:20:25,683
Yeah.

347
00:20:25,683 --> 00:20:29,157
But Momma told me real men
never scream out loud.

348
00:20:37,403 --> 00:20:40,656
You traitor, coming in here
and trying to kill us.

349
00:20:40,656 --> 00:20:45,286
Is that any way to repay me
for all I’ve done?

350
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:49,140
We’re not going to let anyone
interfere with our research.

351
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,546
[HEERO:] Botched your mission?

352
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:59,801
You couldn't destroy the base and
you didn't kill Dr. J and the
others.

353
00:20:59,801 --> 00:21:01,803
How about a little sympathy?

354
00:21:01,803 --> 00:21:04,596
In any case, I’m still glad
I decided to come here.

355
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:07,558
I’ve got good news.

356
00:21:07,558 --> 00:21:11,605
Your Gundam and mine are being
rebuilt as we speak, you know.

357
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:14,148
I can hardly wait until
they’re done.

358
00:21:14,148 --> 00:21:17,360
Looks like OZ will be
keeping us alive for a while.

359
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:19,528
It's a good chance, so
don't die yet.

360
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,990
Don't worry about me, pal.

361
00:21:21,990 --> 00:21:24,660
I have no intention of
dying that easily.

362
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:27,703
There's the colonies to fight for.

363
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:29,080
[DUO:] Just watch me.

364
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,583
I’ll become the God of
Death once again!

365
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:38,506
But right now...I need some sleep.

366
00:21:38,506 --> 00:21:40,133
[TROWA:] I’ve just
completed my mission

367
00:21:40,133 --> 00:21:42,468
to escort Ambassador
Peacecraft on his return.

368
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,511
[UNE:] Thank you.

369
00:21:43,511 --> 00:21:45,830
I'm sure the Ambassador realizes
by now

370
00:21:45,998 --> 00:21:48,016
how firm outer space’s decision
is.

371
00:21:48,016 --> 00:21:50,893
How about from the eyes of
Zechs Merquise?

372
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:53,146
[UNE:] He has opinions about
this era as well.

373
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,440
The day will surely come
when we’ll battle again.

374
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:57,733
We'll hear his decision then.

375
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:01,278
I really don't think anyone
can stop the future.

376
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,240
Not even Mr. Treize.

377
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:06,943
What I can do, though, is try and
direct the future

378
00:22:07,111 --> 00:22:08,995
towards Mr. Treize’s
ideal.

379
00:22:08,995 --> 00:22:12,040
I can sacrifice my life
for that purpose.

380
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,126
I will fight and try to win..

381
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,295
For Mr. Treize's future.

382
00:22:17,295 --> 00:22:20,005
And also for my own future, yes.

383
00:22:29,808 --> 00:23:40,461
[ENDING MUSIC]

384
00:23:40,461 --> 00:23:43,118
[NARRATOR:] Is destruction the
only path left

385
00:23:43,286 --> 00:23:45,050
for an outer space gone
insane?

386
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,718
Time and time again,

387
00:23:46,718 --> 00:23:49,005
a mobile suit resembling a Gundam
attacks

388
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:51,346
the colonies that are arming
themselves.

389
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:55,226
Trowa and Heero head out to face
this powerful new mobile suit.

390
00:23:55,226 --> 00:23:59,856
The pilot is Quatre, cold with
anger and full of deep sorrow.

391
00:23:59,856 --> 00:24:03,276
Next, on Gundam Wing Episode 24

392
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:06,040
The Gundam They Called Zero.
