[NARRATOR:] In the year
After Colony 175,

3
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:33,803
the leader of the colonies
was assassinated.

4
00:01:33,803 --> 00:01:36,388
Five Gundams were
supposed to have been

5
00:01:36,388 --> 00:01:38,306
sent to Earth to take revenge.

6
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,643
However, since OZ's
activities in space

7
00:01:40,643 --> 00:01:44,355
took the form of cooperation,
rather than control,

8
00:01:44,355 --> 00:01:49,485
the colonies decided to accept OZ.

9
00:01:49,485 --> 00:01:52,238
In the year After Colony 195,

10
00:01:52,238 --> 00:01:54,240
As OZ moves to take over

11
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:55,950
both the Earth and outer space,

12
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,951
the Gundams are labeled as rebels

13
00:01:57,951 --> 00:02:00,078
and are isolated from society.

14
00:02:00,078 --> 00:02:02,040
With no place to return,

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,666
the Gundams and their pilots

16
00:02:03,666 --> 00:02:06,418
are forced to fight for a
reason to exist

17
00:02:06,418 --> 00:02:09,796
in the ever‐changing world.

18

[HILDE:] Hey you!
Stop right there!

19
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,011
This one's for the peace
of the colony!

20
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:17,388
Hang on a second here,

21
00:02:17,388 --> 00:02:21,225
I’m fighting for the peace of
the colony as well!

Got him!

23
00:02:25,438 --> 00:02:28,900
Hey, we’re both fighting for
the colonies, right?

24
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:34,488
Then how is it that we’ve
become enemies?

[OZ SOLDIER:] We're about 90% done

00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,418
with the attachment of the
satellite’s drive mechanism.

28

How much longer will it take?

29
00:02:50,505 --> 00:02:51,296
[OZ SOLDIER:] It should be done

30
00:02:51,296 --> 00:02:52,631
within the next two days.

31
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,506
[OZ COMMANDER:] I see.

32
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,510
So that would mean a total
of about ten days

33
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:57,928
to complete our move to
OZ's power zone.

34
00:02:57,928 --> 00:03:01,098
Contact Colonel Une so I can give
her a progress report.

Yes sir!

00:03:02,058 --> 00:03:04,851
[OZ SOLDIER:] An unidentified
shuttle is headed this way!

37
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:05,811
[OZ COMMANDER:] A shuttle?

38
00:03:05,811 --> 00:03:08,480
[OZ SOLDIER:] Yes, but it's quite
small for a shuttle.

39
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:09,356
[OZ COMMANDER:] And its lines?

40
00:03:09,356 --> 00:03:10,065
[OZ SOLDIER:] They're open.

41
00:03:10,065 --> 00:03:13,276
I've contacted them several times
now, but it still won't respond!

Get a hold of security and have
them protect our defense line.

If you come any closer, we
will open fire!

You’re saying I’m too lenient,

No.

I'm saying it's too risky

to be depending on the
abilities of those pilots.

Those associated with the Gundams

68
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,294
still hold a great deal of value.

69
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,839
In fact, the pilot of

70

mastered operating the Mercurius.

I hate to admit it,

but no OZ pilot has skills
that exceed his.

still too risky!

[OZ SOLDIER OVER RADIO:] We
received transmission

00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:37,147
from someone thought to be
the enemy pilot,

101

who declared he’d destroy

the civilian colony at
point 06E next.

103

He then sent this information

00:06:42,527 --> 00:06:44,112
through an inaccessible blueprint.

105
00:06:44,112 --> 00:06:45,989
Thought to be that of Gundam 04.

106
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:48,365
He meant this as a
declaration of war!

Okay.

No, Lady Une.

the Vayeate and the Mercurius

116
00:07:06,217 --> 00:07:07,885
are greater than that
of the Tauruses.

00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:08,887

An unidentified

that it has plans to
destroy a colony.

Really?

00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:48,509
Yes, it's a new model.

127
00:07:48,509 --> 00:07:50,845
[DOCTOR J:] What about its
characteristics and weapons?

128
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,514
Don't you have any detailed
information on it?

129
00:07:53,514 --> 00:07:56,934
They know it has something to do
with the Gundam 04, Sandrock.

130
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:58,227
Is it Quatre?

131
00:07:58,227 --> 00:07:59,395
Could be.

132
00:07:59,395 --> 00:08:02,899
The only other thing is that
it has the firepower

133
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,860
to completely wipe out a natural
resource satellite.

134
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,364
I’m gonna go confirm
what they know.

135
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,740
[PROFESSOR G:] Must be the
blueprint you left behind.

136
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:14,119
Depends on the size of the
resource satellite,

137
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:16,079
but the power of
destruction implied

138
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:17,747
points to what was on
the blueprint.

139
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:19,207
The original Gundam

140
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,167
that the five of us designed has
now been completed.

141
00:08:22,167 --> 00:08:24,587
I can smell something
dangerous in the air.

142
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:28,049
Even a layman could tell that
amount of power is unnecessary.

143
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,050
But the fact that the
pilot's using it

144
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:32,094
proves that he's either
quite ignorant

145
00:08:32,094 --> 00:08:33,387
or incredibly aggressive.

146
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:36,932
Then he's doing something even
we hesitated to do.

147
00:08:36,932 --> 00:08:38,809
It wouldn’t surprise me

148
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:43,355
if one or two
colonies disappeared.

149
00:08:43,355 --> 00:08:44,732
[OZ SOLDIER:] Get out, 01.

150
00:08:44,732 --> 00:08:46,900
C’mon, how come him again?

151
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:50,404
I'm a better pilot than 01 is,
you know!

152
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:51,822
Let me take care of
the next battle!

153
00:08:51,822 --> 00:08:53,740
You can’t do it in your shape.

154
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:56,119
Even a Gundam pilot runs the
risk of being killed

155
00:08:56,119 --> 00:08:58,620
in this next mission.

156
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,082
Because it’s a Gundam pilot
you’ll be fighting.

157
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,709
What?

158
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:04,877
[TROWA:] Apparently
it's a new model.

159
00:09:04,877 --> 00:09:07,589
He wiped out a whole OZ
division with one suit.

160
00:09:07,589 --> 00:09:09,590
What are its
characteristics and weapons?

161
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:11,592
The engineers asked the
same questions.

162
00:09:11,592 --> 00:09:13,552
That shows that you’re
familiar with them.

163
00:09:13,552 --> 00:09:15,179
[HEERO:] Okay, let's go.

164
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:17,432
With that red one, the Mercurius,

165
00:09:17,432 --> 00:09:19,392
this should prove to be
quite a fight.

166
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:21,394
You're coming, like it or not.

167
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,395
And you'll just stand
back and watch

168
00:09:23,395 --> 00:09:26,149
as the two Gundam pilots
fight each other!

169
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,734
Hey, 01! Don't do it!

170
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:34,407
It's probably a suit
performance test!

171
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:36,492
You guys just better
keep quiet there.

172
00:09:36,492 --> 00:09:38,105
You'll get your turn eventually.

173
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,507
I don’t think that guy was acting.

174
00:09:51,507 --> 00:09:54,844
We have to assume he really
has betrayed us.

175
00:09:54,844 --> 00:09:57,137
We don't need to worry about that.

176
00:09:57,137 --> 00:09:59,182
He’s one guy we can trust.

177
00:09:59,182 --> 00:10:02,727
[WU FEI:] What makes you so sure?

178
00:10:02,727 --> 00:10:05,437
Because no traitor’s gonna bring
us a gift like this

179
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:07,399
that so much thought’s
been put into.

180
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:08,565
Hey, that’s...

181
00:10:08,565 --> 00:10:10,777
[RECORDING OF TROWA:] Duo
Maxwell and Wu Fei Chang.

182
00:10:10,777 --> 00:10:13,237
This was given to me by Master O.

183
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:16,532
Use it to kill time.

184
00:10:16,532 --> 00:10:19,244
Son of a gun.

185
00:10:19,244 --> 00:10:20,334
Right?

186
00:10:45,854 --> 00:10:47,104
What is this?

187
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:50,399
It’s the carrier for the
Vayeate and Mercurius.

188
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:51,484
[TROWA:] We've got these two.

189
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,194
And Duo and Wu Fei's Gundams

190
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:55,404
have both been upgraded.

191
00:10:55,404 --> 00:10:59,784
I'm sure the pilot of the new
Gundam is Quatre.

192
00:10:59,784 --> 00:11:01,494
The time may have come.

193
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,914
Once we join up with Quatre,
we'll attack OZ!

194
00:11:04,914 --> 00:11:06,999
How can you be sure he's our ally?

195
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:09,000
Assumptions lead to mistakes.

196
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,547
Besides, we're piloting OZ's
mobile suits, right?

197
00:11:12,547 --> 00:11:15,590
We may be forced to
battle with him.

198
00:11:15,590 --> 00:11:18,219
If he proves to be a strong ally,

199
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:21,889
we might have the force needed to
fight OZ, as you say.

200
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,932
But if his Gundam lacks power,

201
00:11:23,932 --> 00:11:25,642
we'll end up destroying it.

202
00:11:25,642 --> 00:11:27,645
[HEERO:] It'd be more advantageous

203
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:30,064
for you to continue hiding
yourself within OZ

204
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,232
until you can defeat Treize.

205
00:11:32,232 --> 00:11:33,734
You knew all along.

206
00:11:33,734 --> 00:11:35,569
[HEERO:] In either case, we'll
have a better idea

207
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:36,820
after this battle.

208
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:37,946
[TROWA:] You're right.

209
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:59,469
[OZ SOLDIER:] We've finished
evacuating the civilians.

210
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,554
The enemy could show up
from any direction!

211
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:03,555
Be on the lookout!

212
00:12:03,555 --> 00:12:06,475
[OZ SOLDIER:] Section I:
everything's under control!

213
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,145
[OZ SOLDIER:] Section 2:
all under control!

214
00:12:09,145 --> 00:12:10,479
[OZ SOLDIER:] This
colony is equipped

215
00:12:10,479 --> 00:12:12,397
with beam cannons on the
outer surface.

216
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:13,690
The colony can defend itself

217
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:15,431
no matter what
enemies approach it.

218
00:12:20,739 --> 00:12:23,825
[QUATRE:] Calling Colony 06E3.

219
00:12:23,825 --> 00:12:25,912
I'm about to eliminate the colony.

220
00:12:25,912 --> 00:12:27,830
There’s no sense fighting back,

221
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,499
leave the colony at once.

222
00:12:29,499 --> 00:12:31,167
I will repeat:

223
00:12:31,167 --> 00:12:33,080
Leave the colony at once.

224
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,599
[OZ SOLDIER:] The Gundam is here!

225
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:47,600
[OZ COMMANDER:] Counter‐attack!

226
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:53,314
Prepare to fire the
outer beam cannons!

227
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:54,391
And fire!

228
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:48,577
[EXPLOSIONS]

229
00:13:48,577 --> 00:13:51,789
You're afraid of dying,
aren't you guys.

230
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:54,940
In that case, you shouldn't
be fighting at all!

231
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:26,324
[MASSIVE EXPLOSION]

232
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:27,659
That's funny.

233
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:30,202
I have tears in my eyes.

234
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:32,419
But I'm not one bit sad.

235
00:14:41,505 --> 00:14:42,840
[TROWA:] You're awake.

236
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:44,215
[HEERO:] Are we there already?

237
00:14:44,215 --> 00:14:45,342
That was quick.

238
00:14:45,342 --> 00:14:47,177
Our destination just changed.

239
00:14:47,177 --> 00:14:49,597
We were too late to
save that colony.

240
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:50,639
[HEERO:] Was it him?

241
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,265
Yeah.

242
00:14:51,265 --> 00:14:54,394
He said he'd be destroying a
colony in this area next.

243
00:14:54,394 --> 00:14:56,520
This carrier’s too obvious.

244
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,432
[TROWA:] We'll proceed from here
in the mobile suits.

245
00:15:03,735 --> 00:15:05,195
[TROWA:] Our objective
is to find out

246
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:06,739
how powerful the Gundam is.

247
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,490
We'll fight it only if necessary.

248
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:10,659
Got it?

249
00:15:10,659 --> 00:15:12,452
But it’s Quatre we're up against.

250
00:15:12,452 --> 00:15:14,622
There shouldn’t be anything
to worry about.

251
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:16,999
Trowa, be cautious.

252
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,250
Something’s not right.

253
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:20,460
What's the matter?

254
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:24,302
Don’t forget, he just
destroyed a colony.

255
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,767
[TROWA:] We'll lure the enemy in.

256
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,977
Mercurius, you move in
independently,

257
00:15:36,977 --> 00:15:39,564
and attack the enemy on sight.

258
00:15:39,564 --> 00:15:44,902
[HEERO:] Roger.

259
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:46,654
[OZ SOLDIER:] Officer Trowa.

260
00:15:46,654 --> 00:15:48,947
Aren't you giving that
former Gundam pilot

261
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:50,032
too much freedom?

262
00:15:50,032 --> 00:15:51,409
Don't worry about it.

263
00:15:51,409 --> 00:15:52,409
I've got the switch

264
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,120
to his self‐detonation
device right here.

265
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,330
[TROWA:] Besides, he's
completely focused

266
00:15:57,330 --> 00:15:58,415
on the Gundam right now.

267
00:15:58,415 --> 00:16:01,006
He clearly sees it as an enemy.

268
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,679
This is pretty awesome.

269
00:16:11,679 --> 00:16:14,390
I heard it'll be
completed in one month.

270
00:16:14,390 --> 00:16:16,017
Now that Quatre is back,

271
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,560
we're going to be busy again.

272
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:20,270
I have no intention of thinking of

273
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,899
an unconfirmed Gundam
an ally of ours.

274
00:16:22,899 --> 00:16:25,692
But the Gundam is defeating
OZ's troops, right?

275
00:16:25,692 --> 00:16:27,444
It's gotta be an ally.

276
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,364
I certainly do hope so.

277
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:36,079
But I've got a bad feeling.

278
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:37,329
Good job.

279
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,164
Sir!

280
00:16:38,164 --> 00:16:40,165
Is this where the air
supply system

281
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,917
for the cells is controlled?

282
00:16:41,917 --> 00:16:44,795
Yes, it's controlled here.

283
00:16:44,795 --> 00:16:48,340
Is that so?

284
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,467
Mr. Tubarov!

285
00:16:49,467 --> 00:16:51,009
What are you trying to do?

286
00:16:51,009 --> 00:16:53,179
Cutting off the air supply
to the prisons.

287
00:16:53,179 --> 00:16:56,099
I haven't received
any such orders!

288
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:58,059
[OZ SOLDIER:] Are these orders
from Colonel Une?

289
00:16:58,059 --> 00:17:01,437
I'm giving out these orders.

290
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:03,022
Nothing to worry about.

291
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:06,150
You're just doing precisely as
told, that's all.

292
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:11,155
Lady Une's a bit too soft
for her own good.

293
00:17:11,155 --> 00:17:13,615
[DOCTOR J:] Oh my, I must
be getting old.

294
00:17:13,615 --> 00:17:16,119
My knees are feeling weak.

295
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:18,662
You fool, they've cut off our air.

296
00:17:18,662 --> 00:17:20,205
Goodness, you noticed.

297
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:22,207
Then my efforts were wasted.

298
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:25,294
I just didn't want you old men
worrying too much.

299
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,880
I’d say we’ve got thirty
minutes at most.

300
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:30,549
My only regret is that
we weren’t able

301
00:17:30,549 --> 00:17:31,384
to complete our upgrade

302
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,052
of the Deathscythe and
the Shenlong.

303
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,679
If you wanna die then
hurry up and die.

304
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:37,055
You're wasting air.

305
00:17:37,055 --> 00:17:39,850
You know they hate
persistent old men.

306
00:17:39,850 --> 00:17:41,477
But you've gotta be persistent

307
00:17:41,477 --> 00:17:44,772
to get anything out of life.

308
00:17:44,772 --> 00:17:45,605
Damn!

309
00:17:45,605 --> 00:17:49,944
What a dinky way to
kill us all off!

310
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:52,905
Man, I sure wish I could've
gone to battle today,

311
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:53,982
instead of Heero.

312
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:02,414
[DUO:] What are you doing, Wu Fei?

313
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:04,875
There's no sense
studying that now.

314
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:07,879
Stay calm if you want to live a
little bit longer.

315
00:18:07,879 --> 00:18:10,172
We don’t stand a chance

316
00:18:10,172 --> 00:18:11,590
unless something pretty
drastic happens.

317
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:12,925
I'm doing everything I can

318
00:18:12,925 --> 00:18:17,554
just in case that “something
drastic” does happen.

319
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:18,889
Wu Fei?

320
00:18:18,889 --> 00:18:20,390
Hmm?

321
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:23,477
Sorry, but I'm gonna
throw in the towel.

322
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:26,564
Oh, this is such a
lame way to die!

323
00:18:26,564 --> 00:18:28,446
This is so not cool!

324
00:18:34,989 --> 00:18:39,117
[TROWA:] The motion sensor detects
nothing on the outside.

325
00:18:39,117 --> 00:18:41,077
[OZ SOLDIER:] Do you really
think he's here?

326
00:18:41,077 --> 00:18:44,289
Couldn't he have already gone
to a different area?

327
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:45,124
No.

328
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:47,401
I'm certain that the
Gundam's here.

329
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:23,220
The colony doesn't need things
like these at all.

330
00:19:26,707 --> 00:19:27,875
[OZ SOLDIER:] It's here!

331
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:28,959
The Gundam is here!

332
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:30,794
It's inside the colony!

333
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:33,999
What the colony really
needs is a war!

334
00:19:41,805 --> 00:19:43,599
[OZ SOLDIER:] The three
suits in the colony

335
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,850
have been destroyed!

336
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,229
The Gundam is coming out!

337
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:50,439
Quatre, go ahead.

338
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:52,388
Show me what that Gundam can do!

339
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:22,179
[EXPLOSIONS]

340
00:20:22,179 --> 00:20:24,682
[TROWA:] So this is
the new Gundam.

341
00:20:24,682 --> 00:20:26,892
Heero, there's no worry.

342
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:29,729
This Gundam is unparalleled.

343
00:20:29,729 --> 00:20:32,439
[TROWA:] Quatre, this is Trowa.

344
00:20:32,439 --> 00:20:36,569
Can you hear me, Quatre?

345
00:20:36,569 --> 00:20:38,237
[QUATRE:] I can hear you, Trowa.

346
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:42,699
Don't come any closer, Trowa.

347
00:20:42,699 --> 00:20:44,827
What did I just say?

348
00:20:44,827 --> 00:20:47,020
Don't get any closer to me!

349
00:21:11,102 --> 00:21:13,522
Hey, Quatre!

350
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,815
What's going on here?

351
00:21:15,815 --> 00:21:16,692
[QUATRE:] Trowa.

352
00:21:16,692 --> 00:21:18,694
Outer space has gone crazy,

353
00:21:18,694 --> 00:21:21,489
I’m gonna use this Gundam
to destroy it all.

354
00:21:21,489 --> 00:21:23,907
I have no choice but to
destroy all the weapons

355
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:25,909
that have accumulated out here.

356
00:21:25,909 --> 00:21:28,912
The colonies are becoming armed,
right?

357
00:21:28,912 --> 00:21:33,834
That's why the colonies
must be destroyed!

358
00:21:33,834 --> 00:21:37,879
What's the matter, Quatre?

359
00:21:37,879 --> 00:21:40,382
This isn't like the Quatre I know!

360
00:21:40,382 --> 00:21:42,884
Tell the others for me.

361
00:21:42,884 --> 00:21:45,137
Tell them to stay away from me!

362
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:49,391
Otherwise, I'll end up
killing them.

363
00:21:52,227 --> 00:21:57,024
[QUATRE:] I'm telling you not
to get any closer!!

364
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:59,456
Is that all you've got to say?

365
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:11,622
If everything has gone crazy,

366
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:15,459
then I'll believe in myself
and keep fighting.

367
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,201
[HEERO:] Quatre, I'm
gonna kill you.

368
00:22:29,639 --> 00:23:39,960
[ENDING MUSIC]

369
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,879
[NARRATOR:] The mobile doll
project is another step

370
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:44,630
towards the Romefeller
Foundation's conquest.

371
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:47,675
Treize opposes this and
decides to step down

372
00:23:47,675 --> 00:23:49,385
from his position as
the leader of OZ.

373
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:52,514
The Gundam pilots cause a blood
bath in outer space

374
00:23:52,514 --> 00:23:54,599
as they continue their
mortal battle.

375
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:57,935
During the battle, Trowa is
thrown out of his suit

376
00:23:57,935 --> 00:24:00,147
and drifts into the silent
depths of space.

377
00:24:00,147 --> 00:24:03,650
Next, on Gundam Wing: Episode 25

378
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,679
Quatre vs Heero
