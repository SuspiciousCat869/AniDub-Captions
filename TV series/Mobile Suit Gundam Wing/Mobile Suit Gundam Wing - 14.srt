00:01:24,168 --> 00:01:31,175
Zero System, the name given to a
cockpit system that quickly
calculates battle data

3
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:37,806
and feeds the large amounts of
statistics on estimated values
directly back to the pilot.

4
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,393
But this system also drives a
pilot to his limits,

5
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:46,193
to the extent that he won’t even
fear his own death, thus

6
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:52,738
helping him gain absolute
victory. The year is
After Colony 195.

7
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:58,313
As the world constantly changes
in the chaotic era, there
are two mobile suits

8
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:04,208
that could turn humans into the
ultimate weapon. The Wing Zero,
and the Epyon.

[RAINFALL]

00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,941
[CATHERINE:] Trowa? Is
that you Trowa?

12
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:35,948
It’s me Trowa, Catherine! You
haven’t forgotten me, have you?

13
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,243
Catherine?

14
00:02:40,953 --> 00:02:42,413
Oh Trowa...

15
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,795
<i>BRAVO: This is Bravo, I’m about</i>
<i>to enter! ‐ [SOLDIER:] Roger.</i>

16
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,030
That’s enough!

17
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:20,410
Wu Fei...

18
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:28,000
Ah, Master Long. You’ve provided
me with a place to train. I’ve
been very grateful.

19
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:32,380
Don’t mention it. You’ve done
well to improve as
much as you have.

20
00:03:32,588 --> 00:03:36,550
And I’m positive that Altron
will happily welcome you too.

21
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:41,723
The new Nataku is very strong,
but I don’t think I’ve acquired
the necessary skills

22
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,473
to handle it’s strength.

23
00:03:43,766 --> 00:03:49,230
One’s strength is in the mind.
And one’s mind is a
battle with oneself.

24
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:56,778
Unless you can win against
yourself Wu Fei, you will never
be able to defeat your enemy.

25
00:03:58,446 --> 00:04:02,853
For over 100 years we have
fought the evils of outer space,

26
00:04:02,993 --> 00:04:07,383
but even this colony, which has
protected us for all that time,

27
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:10,053
no longer has the
strength to endure.

28
00:04:10,208 --> 00:04:16,633
It’s been leading us on a path,
headed for destruction. Even so,
we will

29
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:23,180
follow our destiny and see that
we live with integrity. Do you
understand, Wu Fei?

30
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:24,640
[WU FEI:] Integrity?

31
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:32,023
Believing in yourself. Not lying
to yourself. And also never
betraying yourself.

32
00:04:33,315 --> 00:04:34,525

[LONG:] What?

35
00:04:40,323 --> 00:04:42,908
There’s no mercy for those
being destroyed.

36
00:04:57,673 --> 00:05:04,153
Master Long, I must conquer and
defeat my enemy! The enemy I am
fighting is pure evil!

37
00:05:04,305 --> 00:05:09,268
Then there is no need to waver!
It isn’t evil you’re defeating.

38
00:05:09,435 --> 00:05:13,355
The ones that you defeated are
the epitome of evil.

39
00:05:13,815 --> 00:05:18,913
Think about your integrity. That
is our determination,
and it's also

40
00:05:19,070 --> 00:05:21,238
the determination of Altron.

41
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:28,955
[BRAVO:] We know you’re here 05.
Huh?

42
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,208
It’s there!

43
00:05:38,505 --> 00:05:40,053
Is it the Gundam?

<i>proceed to stage 2 of our plan!</i>

<i>is on it's way!</i>

<i>[SHUTTLE PILOT:] This is a</i>
<i>warning to the Gundam Pilot,</i>
<i>surrender at once!</i>

00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:55,013
<i>[SHUTTLE PILOT:] We’re prepared</i>
<i>to attack 0200! Should you</i>
<i>continue to retaliate,</i>

<i>you risk involving the</i>
<i>entire colony.</i>

Goodbye dear Wu Fei. see the
last of our clan go. Witness
it for yourself.

00:07:16,228 --> 00:07:17,783
Is everything set?

00:07:17,938 --> 00:07:19,473
Yes, we’re all ready.

00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:23,633
[LONG:] Our clan will live with
pride, right until the end.

56
00:07:23,776 --> 00:07:26,321
Wu Fei will succeed
us from now on.

57
00:07:27,281 --> 00:07:28,263
Do it.

58
00:07:28,406 --> 00:07:29,366
Yes.

59
00:07:39,418 --> 00:07:40,126
[SOLDIER:] What??

60
00:07:42,463 --> 00:07:43,873
Ah! Master Long!

61
00:07:44,006 --> 00:07:51,563
Wu Fei! Don’t waver! The moment
you do, you’ll give rise to
yet another battle.

62
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:53,973
Please, continue fighting.

63
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,053
MASTER LONG!!!

64
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:59,813
[LONG:] Keep fighting Wu Fei,
for your own sense of integrity!

65
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:17,080
<i>[WU FEI:] No. NO. NOOOO!!!</i>

66
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:28,300
It is up to me. I’ll decide
what integrity is.

67
00:08:32,430 --> 00:08:36,100
[HOWARD:] It appears that there
was a significant battle
in the L5 colony.

68
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:38,643
Wu Fei might have
something to do with it.

69
00:08:38,810 --> 00:08:41,383
The pilot of 05 I recall.

70
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,403
Right.

71
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:46,903
Our force consists of this ship
and the Wing Zero. That’s
not nearly enough

72
00:08:47,068 --> 00:08:52,616
to confront the Romefeller
foundation. Couldn’t we invite
Wu Fei to join us as an ally?

73
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:59,331
That’d be difficult. The Gundam
pilots have the courage and guts
to fight on their own.

74
00:08:59,706 --> 00:09:03,513
Who knows if he’ll help someone
like you who’s
fighting for a cause.

75
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:08,173
But we are fighting the same
enemy! I just want a
chance to talk.

76
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:14,805
Alright then. Alter course
to the L5 colony.

77
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:22,353
<i>[DERMAIL:] Thanks to the success</i>

<i>We will therefore</i>

<i>[DERMAIL:] Tubarov, I would like</i>
<i>you to personally take charge</i>
<i>of our next plan.</i>

81
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,490
[TUBAROV:] The next plan sir?

<i>We have a responsibility to</i>
<i>maintain peace.</i>

83

<i>In order to do this we need</i>
<i>overwhelming power.</i>

84
00:09:40,163 --> 00:09:42,666
The mobile dolls should
more than suffice.

85
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,903
<i>[DERMAIL:] The mobile dolls are</i>
<i>of use only when employed in</i>
<i>limited battles.</i>

00:09:47,045 --> 00:09:51,008
<i>Right now we need something that</i>
<i>will give us results on a</i>
<i>much larger scale.</i>

87
00:09:51,466 --> 00:09:52,673
<i>Chief Engineer Tubarov,</i>

88
00:09:52,801 --> 00:09:57,306
<i>you will head the construction</i>
<i>of a Peacemillion caliber</i>
<i>space battleship.</i>

89
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,850
A space battleship?

90
00:10:14,115 --> 00:10:15,353
I’ll be on my way.

91
00:10:15,490 --> 00:10:20,103
[NOIN:] Quatre, Sally Po's
information is reliable,
we can trust it.

92
00:10:20,245 --> 00:10:23,703
Yes. I needed to keep a low
profile until now so I wouldn’t

93
00:10:23,831 --> 00:10:26,001
cause the Maguanac
comrades more trouble.

94
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,673
But the situation's not
the same anymore.

95
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:32,213
Romefeller has destroyed most of
the Treize Faction.

96
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:36,261
So power has drastically shifted
in Romefeller’s favor.

97
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:39,890
The Sanc Kingdom is like a
candle flickering in the wind.

98
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:45,436
Yes! That’s why I have to get
Sandrock back, and help protect
this nation from the evil.

99
00:10:51,568 --> 00:10:56,490
[PILOT:] This is a warning. You
are entering a war zone.
Detour to point URW.

100
00:10:56,698 --> 00:10:59,201
If you do not follow orders
then we'll open fire.

101
00:11:00,786 --> 00:11:03,621
Open fire without even
guiding me out of here?

102
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,166
We’ll commence attack!

103
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,640
[EXPLOSION]

104
00:11:36,155 --> 00:11:40,868
[QUATRE:] Wait for me, my dear
Sandrock. I’ll be there shortly.

105
00:11:58,593 --> 00:12:02,138
It’s true that we used to be
part of the
Romefeller foundation.

106
00:12:02,973 --> 00:12:08,145
But now the Romefeller
foundation does nothing but
squeeze war funds out of us.

107
00:12:08,478 --> 00:12:11,023
We can’t take this much longer.

108
00:12:11,648 --> 00:12:15,753
All the Romefeller foundation
does is satisfy their
desire to rule!

109
00:12:15,903 --> 00:12:17,821
They've intensified battles!

110
00:12:18,655 --> 00:12:21,200
They’re no different than
the former alliance.

111
00:12:21,783 --> 00:12:25,536
[RELENA:] Trust me, I fully
understand what
you’re all saying.

112
00:12:25,788 --> 00:12:27,803
And doesn't this prove
my point that

113
00:12:27,956 --> 00:12:31,001
true peace cannot be obtained
through military force?

114
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:32,193
I believe it does.

115
00:12:32,335 --> 00:12:38,593
Princess Relena, we need your
guidance now, lead us on to the
right path to peace.

116
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:44,613
My influence is extremely
limited. However, if each one of
you truly wishes for peace

117
00:12:44,765 --> 00:12:47,063
I believe it’s possible to
have the Romefeller

118
00:12:47,225 --> 00:12:49,473
foundation terminate their
military activities.

119
00:12:49,603 --> 00:12:51,938
[APPLAUSE]

120
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,825
[PAGAN:] The foreign delegates
have left safely. They all
seemed quite satisfied!

121
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:10,123
Pagan. do you think I was out of
line, promising peace to
the other nations?

122
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:14,628
Considering what a hard time I’m
having maintaining peace here
in the Sanc Kingdom.

123
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:20,885
Miss Relena, the kind of peace
promoted by Romefeller is just
an empty promise.

124
00:13:21,135 --> 00:13:24,983
[PAGAN:] The pacifism upheld by
the Peacecrafts is peace in
it’s truest form.

125
00:13:25,138 --> 00:13:27,933
And it’s what the other
nations are relying on.

126
00:13:28,558 --> 00:13:32,186
But the military force of
Romefeller is so powerful!

127
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:36,483
Ever since Treize Khushrenada
lost his position in
the organization,

128
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:42,103
Romefeller has had no unifying
force. Their chief
representative, Duke Dermail,

129
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,616
is unlikely to
fulfill that role.

130
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:48,483
[PAGAN:] There's nothing to fear
with the present Romefeller.

131
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,423
Have more confidence
in yourself,

132
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:53,000
and make your ideal
world a reality.

133
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,803
[SOLDIER:] Welcome back from
your escort duties
Lietenant Noin!

134
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:13,770
I’m no longer a lieutenant. I’m
an imperial guard, just
like each of you.

135
00:14:14,396 --> 00:14:18,923
But it's hard to break old
habits from our days in
Oz’s Treize faction,

136
00:14:19,066 --> 00:14:21,195
if you know what I
mean Miss Noin.

137
00:14:21,611 --> 00:14:25,240
Will you at least allow us
soldiers to call you
Captain Noin?

138
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,673
That's okay if it makes you
all feel better.

139
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:32,790
But we're not a military
organization bogged down
with discipline.

140
00:14:33,165 --> 00:14:35,500
Just don’t forget that. ‐Ma'am!

141
00:14:38,503 --> 00:14:39,588
[HEERO:] Captain Noin.

142
00:14:41,256 --> 00:14:42,800
What is it Heero?

143
00:14:42,966 --> 00:14:47,136
An increase in this nation's
military power will attract
Romefeller’s attention.

144
00:14:47,846 --> 00:14:50,473
Why have you taken them in?

145
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:55,145
That issue huh? Follow me and
I’ll show you why.

146
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:58,823
[NOIN:] The main forces of the
Romefeller Foundation

147
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:01,443
are currently gathering around
the Sanc Kingdom.

148
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:04,873
After the Luxembourg plan to
destroy the Treize Faction,

149
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:08,173
their remaining military force
from that battle has been

150
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,618
standing by to invade
the Sanc Kingdom.

151
00:15:10,826 --> 00:15:13,413
Which suggests that right from
the very beginning,

152
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:16,553
Romefeller had no intention
whatsoever of overlooking us.

153
00:15:16,708 --> 00:15:17,763
[HEERO:] Hmm.

154
00:15:17,918 --> 00:15:21,713
[NOIN:] At this rate we'll end
up suffering the fate of the
previous Sanc Kingdom.

155
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,763
It may not be a significant
force yet, but in order

156
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:28,261
to confront the
Romefeller Foundation,

157
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:33,273
we need to take in past members
of the Treize faction and
the former alliance.

158
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:36,145
Does all this answer your
question, I wonder?

159
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:42,358
Aren't you a bit laid back? This
military power could start
attacking us almost any day now.

160
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:46,446
But having a Gundam on our side
is like a symbol of hope for us.

161
00:15:46,696 --> 00:15:48,603
Don't count on that too much.

162
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:53,161
Unlike Quatre I don't see much
sense in protecting
this country.

163
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,763
But the right honorable
Treize's Gundam

164
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,791
that you brought here has guided
many soldiers to us!

165
00:15:59,793 --> 00:16:03,505
[NOIN:] It’s a symbol of
opposition towards Romefeller.

166
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:15,225
<i>[HEERO:] Treize. What’s the big</i>
<i>idea, giving me this thing?</i>

167
00:16:28,446 --> 00:16:33,785
I hate fighting mobile dolls.
Doesn’t anyone want to
fight me directly!?

168
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,920
[PILOT:] The Taurus mobile
dolls are destroyed!

169
00:16:44,796 --> 00:16:47,465
[CAPTAIN:] That leaves no
choice. Retreat at once!

170
00:16:50,926 --> 00:16:55,598
People degenerate using machines
instead of risking
their own lives.

171
00:16:56,475 --> 00:16:59,728
This may be the perfect time
for us to defeat Oz.

172
00:17:08,070 --> 00:17:13,450
<i>[ZECHS:] Gundam 05! This is</i>
<i>Zechs Marquise! Calling from</i>
<i>the Peacemillion.</i>

173
00:17:23,043 --> 00:17:24,213
That’s Wing Zero!

174
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,505
<i>[ZECHS:] I’d like to</i>
<i>discuss an offer.</i>

175
00:17:28,215 --> 00:17:30,425
AHHHH!!

176
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,556
Hang on! I am not your enemy,
kid!

177
00:17:40,060 --> 00:17:44,105
All evil that chooses to fight
in outer space is my enemy!

178
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,193
I agree kid, that’s why you and
I must fight together

179
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,115
against Oz and the
Romefeller foundation.

180
00:17:56,326 --> 00:17:58,593
<i>[WU FEI:] You’re a member</i>
<i>of Oz yourself!</i>

181
00:17:58,745 --> 00:18:00,663
<i>[ZECHS:] In the past I was!</i>

182
00:18:01,623 --> 00:18:03,253
But no longer!

183
00:18:03,416 --> 00:18:05,710
<i>[WU FEI:] I don’t</i>
<i>trust traitors!</i>

184
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:11,716
<i>[ZECHS:] How can I get you</i>
<i>to LISTEN to me?!</i>

185
00:18:12,633 --> 00:18:14,176
By defeating me.

186
00:18:15,011 --> 00:18:15,860
That’s fine.

187
00:18:16,028 --> 00:18:19,600
Just the position that any
Gundam pilot would take.

188
00:18:32,486 --> 00:18:36,325
[BOTH SCREAM]

189
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:43,915
This Gundam 05 has become
considerably stronger!

190
00:18:51,965 --> 00:18:54,718
I need to come out on top this
time, I must win!

191
00:19:10,775 --> 00:19:14,530
Peacemillion, NO!!!

192
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,866
<i>[ZECHS:] It's... unharmed.</i>
<i>What??</i>

193
00:19:30,295 --> 00:19:33,423
What? What in the world are
these images here?

194
00:19:34,006 --> 00:19:37,253
<i>[ZECHS:] My enemy...</i> No!
He’s not.

195
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:40,888
The boy is not the enemy I
should be fighting.

196
00:19:41,348 --> 00:19:45,018
You can’t fool me. You are evil!

197
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,073
Zechs no!

198
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:07,040
<i>Hey Zechs, get a grip, the Zero</i>
<i>System is messing</i>
<i>with your head!</i>

199
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:15,381
No mistake about it, this man
will be an enemy to me.

200
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:23,013
[HOWARD:] This system displays
numerous sets of data

201
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:25,641
to do away with a
warrior’s insecurities.

202
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:29,016
Such a system will only
lead to tragedy.

203
00:20:29,185 --> 00:20:31,143
Because there’s nothing sadder

204
00:20:31,273 --> 00:20:34,150
than a soul being toyed
with by a machine.

205
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:38,030
Telling Zechs to overcome this
now may be too harsh.

206
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:53,128
[APPLAUSE AND CHEERS]

207
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,843
Get a move on. We'll be
leaving here tomorrow.

208
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:01,928
[CATHERINE:] Hey,

209
00:21:03,346 --> 00:21:05,755
But you saw how happy we
made everyone?

210
00:21:05,923 --> 00:21:08,643
Why did you suddenly make
this the last show?

211
00:21:09,518 --> 00:21:12,605
They say that a Gundam showed up
not far from here.

212
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,565
A Gundam showed up?

213
00:21:15,025 --> 00:21:19,153
[TROWA:] Hey Sis ‐Huh? What’s
the matter Trowa?

214
00:21:20,655 --> 00:21:22,833
Umm... Where am I
supposed to put this?

215
00:21:22,991 --> 00:21:25,951
Oh that! You don’t need to
worry about it,

216
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,371
I’ll put it away
myself later on.

217
00:21:29,873 --> 00:21:30,540
But I‐

218
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:34,168
You have to listen to what your
sister says, okay?

219
00:21:35,128 --> 00:21:36,963
Mhmm. If you say so.

220
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:40,031
[RINGMASTER:] As long as he's
around

221
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,385
you never know what
trouble we could find
ourselves in.

222
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:45,846
We have no choice but
to move on now.

223
00:21:46,263 --> 00:21:51,936
You’re right. I pity him having
amnesia, but Trowa’s better
off this way I think.

224
00:21:54,856 --> 00:22:00,778
Gundam. What’s that? I’m sure
I’ve heard of it
somewhere before.

225
00:22:02,155 --> 00:22:06,826
Not again! I’m so cold!

226
00:22:08,245 --> 00:22:13,416
[CATHERINE:] Trowa... you’re
safe here. I’ll never let you
get near a battlefield.

227
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,210
I’ll protect you no matter what.

228
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:36,230
