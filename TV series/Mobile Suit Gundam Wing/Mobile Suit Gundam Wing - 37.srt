00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,010
[MUSIC]

2
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:29,150
The attacks by the five Gundams
sent by the Space Colonies...

3
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,950
...reflected their
retaliatory intentions.

4
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:35,900
The Gundam's target is OZ, who
had masked its identity

5
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:39,280
within the mobile suit troops of
the Alliance Military.

6
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:42,620
The Gundams' had a number of
missions to attack OZ.

7
00:01:44,990 --> 00:01:47,880
The year is After Colony 195.

8
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,700
OZ has finally taken
center stage.

9
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,740
With an army of elite soldiers
at his command...

10
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,510
...Treize Khushrenada
carries out his plans

11
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,680
to destroy the
Alliance Military.

12
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,110
The battle between the

13
00:02:00,110 --> 00:02:02,650
mobile suits sent to
Earth and OZ...

14
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:05,340
...causes the Earth to
shudder violently.

15
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,700
I've mastered numerous mobile
suits in the past,

16
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:13,290
so why? What am I afraid of?!

17
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:18,640
Is this the end?

18
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:22,910
LONG LIVE, KING ZECHS!

19
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:25,530
My hands are too
stained with blood.

20
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,760
I'm completely unfit to lead the
Peacecraft monarchy.

21
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:33,040
[NARRATOR:] Heero,
Distracted by Defeat

22
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,000
[OS:] So that's Tallgeese.

23
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:59,950
I can see that it's no
ordinary machine.

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,890
And that Zechs would be the only
one who could pilot it.

25
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,720
It might not be wise giving
Zechs too much
special treatment.

26
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:13,400
We're providing a superior suit
to a superior pilot.

27
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,780
Any problem with that?

28
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,760
I'm concerned that it might
give him an attitude.

29
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:23,340
Lady, there's no need for you
to worry about that.

30
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,120
I need you to focus on
the major issues.

31
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,890
Sir.

32
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,020
We've awaited you,
Your Excellency.

33
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,520
Sorry to cause you so
much trouble.

34
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,160
Thanks for your concern.

35
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:42,760
And Lieutenant Noin. I commend
you on your front‐line battles.

36
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,800
I'd like to thank
you personally.

37
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,700
You're too kind, sir.

38
00:03:47,740 --> 00:03:51,130
Why should Mr. Treize have to
thank his own soldiers?

39
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,400
Then there are those who
shamelessly accept his words.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,710
I've put Lady Une in charge
of our latest plan.

41
00:03:57,710 --> 00:03:59,290
Shall we get started right away?

42
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:00,250
Yes.

43
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:04,030
I'll be giving an explanation of
our strategy at 1600 hours.

44
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,680
It's almost time, be
on your way.

45
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:07,550
Yes, sir!

46
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:13,480
Now Colonel Zechs, Lieutenant
Noin, you two shall attend.

47
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,300
Come with me!

48
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:17,400
Oh, there was something else I
wanted to discuss with Zechs.

49
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:18,910
I'll send him as soon
as we're done.

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,560
Mh‐Hmm

51
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:22,000
Lieutenant Noin! Get a move on.

52
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:22,720
Ma'am.

53
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,340
I believe you have a better
grasp of your feelings...

54
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:30,720
...toward the Alliance by now.

55
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:32,880
Well, Lightning Baron?

56
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,310
Or may I call you
Lightning Count?

57
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:40,110
Your Excellency, I was hoping to
serve you for a little longer.

58
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,990
There's nothing that'd
make me happier.

59
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,280
But you're sure?

60
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:47,640
As it is there's only one name I
could give myself.

61
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:49,630
Killer of His Own Men.

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,890
The Gundams?

63
00:04:50,890 --> 00:04:52,080
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:54,060
In that case, do as you wish.

65
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:55,360
I'm very grateful.

66
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:58,520
By the way, won't you be
taking your mask off?

67
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,790
You've succeeded in
your revenge.

68
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,920
There's no need now to
hide your face.

69
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:07,660
I still bring my personal hatred
onto the battlefield.

70
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,410
Just think of this as my
mark of distinction.

71
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,130
Right, you're a very
devoted soldier.

72
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,600
That's the reason I can trust
you with anything...

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:19,740
...Milliardo Peacecraft.

74
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,740
That name...please don't.

75
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,120
I'm very much looking forward to
the day you remove that
mask of yours.

76
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,090
Yes, sir!

77
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,770
The latest plan involves
transporting the Tauruses...

78
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:39,340
...to the Siberian Base to
install our new mobility system.

79
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:40,730
A new system?

80
00:05:40,990 --> 00:05:42,350
Why haven't I heard of it?

81
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:45,500
Our lack of confidence in the
facilities and security...

82
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,560
...at the Lake Victoria has led
to this transfer plan.

83
00:05:48,810 --> 00:05:49,470
Hmmm

84
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:53,740
The Tauruses will be transported
across the Arabian coast...

85
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:55,260
...under the heavy guard.

86
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:58,300
We will be taking over the
transfer from there.

87
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,910
So far there haven't been
any real threats...

88
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,910
...but we've taken everything
into consideration.

89
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,480
We've already announced a
false transport plan.

90
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:08,400
We won't let the enemies have it
their way this time.

91
00:06:08,510 --> 00:06:09,440
Enemies...?

92
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:10,620
The Gundams...?

93
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,270
The Gundams have attacked
practically all of OZ's plants.

94
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,790
This should once again be an
attractive target for
the Gundams.

95
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:21,660
But as long as I'm in charge,
I'll prevent all such
interference!

96
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,310
Going to Siberia...

97
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,580
...they can pass through
OZ's protected areas.

98
00:06:25,870 --> 00:06:28,520
In which case the Gundams won't
be able to attack.

99
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,200
No, we want them to come.

100
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,690
I consider annihilating the
Gundams a big part of this plan.

101
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:37,550
Our defeats up until now were
because cowardly soldiers...

102
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:39,390
...were too slow to
compile their data.

103
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:41,880
But this time OZ is
dead serious.

104
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,080
I'd like to give a lesson on the
correct way to
eradicate the Gundams.

105
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:50,430
It might not come to much use,
but let me provide you...

106
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:52,270
...with some
background information.

107
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:57,072
Huh?

108
00:07:00,010 --> 00:07:01,310
Dr. J!

109
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,640
We'll refer to the unit that
fell over the Pacific Ocean...

110
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,260
...as Gundam 01. It can
transform into an aircraft.

111
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:13,400
Once located, we'll lure it to
an Aries air zone and
shoot it down.

112
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,780
Without its wings, we can
overcome it in a
protracted battle.

113
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:19,000
Next, the Gundam 02.

114
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,310
[Dr. J:] There is a problem
with the Taurus.

115
00:07:21,310 --> 00:07:24,920
It has the ability to learn from
accumulated battle data.

116
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,720
I'd like to trust OZ's control
system, but it's there's
still the chance...

117
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,320
...that the machine will ignore
the pilot's commands and
move on its own.

118
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:34,830
If the command to kill
overrides the pilot...

119
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:37,400
...the consequences could
be significant.

120
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:41,440
Destroy it, otherwise it'll be a
menace to mankind.

121
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,380
Mission accepted.

122
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:45,790
Who's there?!

123
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,880
I've come to say good‐bye!

124
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:50,600
I have got a bad feeling
about this one.

125
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:54,220
OZ's transport plan is good.

126
00:07:54,220 --> 00:07:58,170
And from what I can gather they
will be taking two routes;
by air and by land.

127
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,470
Heero, could you take
the air route?

128
00:08:01,470 --> 00:08:03,470
I'll fight them on the ground.

129
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:07,980
We'll lose unless we have our
own plan, this time.

130
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:14,320
02's features allow it to
remain unnoticed.

131
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:19,710
And the 03, the main point is to
get it to use up all of its
firepower at an early stage.

132
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:21,390
This is true for all of them...

133
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:24,650
...but not one mobile suit
excels in organized battle.

134
00:08:32,620 --> 00:08:34,880
There's no choice but to attack
while they're transporting.

135
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,720
If the data they collected is
sufficient even the
most elementary...

136
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:41,420
...decoy plans will allow them
to efficiently
disperse their power.

137
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,600
It's by air?

138
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:46,640
We'll take the land!

139
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:48,540
Might be by air.

140
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,760
If we hit their land transport

141
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,260
we can tell everyone which
one's the decoy!

142
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:55,690
Do you think the other
Gundams will come?

143
00:08:55,690 --> 00:08:57,690
We can't win by ourselves.

144
00:08:58,190 --> 00:09:00,650
But I'm positive the
others will come.

145
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:14,540
Sorry

146
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:17,390
I am no longer able to fight

147
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,000
Denounce me, Nataku.

148
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,430
04 is also a
close‐range battle type.

149
00:09:24,590 --> 00:09:28,040
Make sure when facing 05 to
avoid direct combat.

150
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,920
Stop it in it's footsteps and
barrage until it's destroyed.

151
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,600
Be extremely cautious of the
firepower in its left arm.

152
00:09:35,790 --> 00:09:37,520
That concludes my briefing.

153
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,700
I ask that you gather the troops
of the respective bases...

154
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,700
...along this route to stand by.

155
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:44,700
[SOLDIERS:] Yes, Ma'am!

156
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:48,320
Colonel Zechs, I was hoping
you'd take on the task...

157
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,420
...of fighting 01 with the
Tallgeese, one on one.

158
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,080
What do you think?

159
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:55,790
You can't seriously expect
him to go alone!

160
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:56,570
I'll back him up.

161
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,440
But Noin...

162
00:09:58,010 --> 00:10:01,130
There are still some Aries left
in the Lake Victoria base.

163
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:04,490
I request orders to lead the
Aries to battle.

164
00:10:04,490 --> 00:10:07,580
I'm appointing you Lieutenant
to the headquarters.

165
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,510
But why?

166
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,030
You'll be assisting me.

167
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:11,960
Any problems with that?

168
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:13,360
No...

169
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:16,460
Colonel Zechs previously
received a serious blow...

170
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,660
...at the hands of 01.

171
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,600
Now that he has the Tallgeese...

172
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,440
...this would be the perfect
opportunity to get his revenge.

173
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,100
Convenient.

174
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,520
If he loses it all
becomes Zechs' fault.

175
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,630
Noin, it suits me just fine.

176
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:33,240
Actually, I was hoping you'd be
stationed at the headquarters.

177
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:34,120
Colonel?

178
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:37,760
When we meet the enemy we'll
need quick, accurate
information.

179
00:10:38,090 --> 00:10:39,550
I'll need your support there.

180
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:41,340
Sir! Count on me!

181
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,690
Commence operations!

182
00:10:48,780 --> 00:10:49,900
Relena!

183
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,420
Morning everyone.

184
00:10:51,690 --> 00:10:54,000
Relena, something
awful's happened!

185
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,170
Heero has changed schools,
right?

186
00:10:56,170 --> 00:10:57,770
You already knew about it?

187
00:10:58,510 --> 00:11:02,360
There wasn't enough time to
become friends with
Heero and Duo.

188
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,150
Off to fight again, Heero?

189
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,970
Well, I'm headed for my
own battleground.

190
00:11:11,610 --> 00:11:14,170
Mobile suit troop preparation
for both the flight course...

191
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,790
...and the railway
course are complete!

192
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:19,760
Check the observation satellite
for any irregularities
along the course.

193
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:20,920
Yes, ma'am!

194
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:22,780
Only a matter of time.

195
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,280
Excuse me, Colonel Une.

196
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,230
Which is the true carrier route
they will be using?

197
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,450
Both are extremely important.

198
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:34,760
Gundam 04 located 9:0 kilometers
from land route point A.

199
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,440
Right!

200
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,900
Aries No: 4 squadron, attack!

201
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,130
Master Quatre, I have our
target in sight.

202
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,440
No mistaking this security!

203
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,560
It's this route!

204
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,450
Aaargh!

205
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,650
You wish!

206
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,370
Hey, are you okay?!

207
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:54,170
Yeah, I'm fine. Glad you came.

208
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:57,200
Sure, but this
route's the decoy.

209
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:57,930
What?!

210
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,430
Radar plane reporting!

211
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:12,430
A high speed carrier's
headed our way.

212
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,910
Release mobile suits at once
for counterattack!

213
00:13:34,170 --> 00:13:36,800
The Taurus carriers have arrived
at its fueling point.

214
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,800
Backup Defense Army, attack!

215
00:13:50,780 --> 00:13:53,400
Flying object is approaching
from south‐east at a
great speed.

216
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,600
Believed to be 01.

217
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:57,390
It'll arrive at the supply
base in T minus 300.

218
00:13:57,390 --> 00:14:00,000
Come in Zechs! 01 has
just arrived!

219
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,960
It's headed for the air
route supply point

220
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,680
where we're fighting off 03!

221
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:08,860
That's fortunate.

222
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,730
He's headed for the air route.

223
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:13,560
It'll be close, but I'll
take him out midway!

224
00:14:35,150 --> 00:14:36,410
That an Aries?

225
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:37,400
No it's bigger...

226
00:14:42,350 --> 00:14:43,580
Data checked.

227
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:46,350
No match to any OZ weapons?!

228
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:53,770
He's fast!

229
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:01,630
Aaargh!

230
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:07,840
That's enough, Gundam 01.

231
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:12,000
We should have no need for beam
rifles or cannons between us.

232
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,180
We'll fight for recognition
of superiority.

233
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,740
You ARE a Gundam pilot.

234
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:23,800
I'm sure that'll suit you!

235
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,310
There's the flight type.

236
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,310
Is that a new OZ model?

237
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,920
I believe that I've
won this battle!

238
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,380
I feel no fear whatsoever!

239
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:08,010
I'll defeat you without taking
Tallgeese to its full limit!

240
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,630
Prototype Leo!

241
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,510
So OZ has completed them!

242
00:16:12,510 --> 00:16:15,230
It won't be easy, but I'll
try and destroy it!

243
00:16:17,370 --> 00:16:19,340
My mission's to
destroy the Taurus.

244
00:16:19,550 --> 00:16:20,350
I'm checking out!

245
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:28,280
Half the land route Leo troops
have been defeated...

246
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,080
...by 02 and 04.

247
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:32,620
01 is battling the Tallgeese.

248
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,210
But 03 is headed for
the supply base.

249
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:38,280
Who would've guessed Gundams
had this much power?

250
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:41,660
The Taurus carriers are on
standby for emergency take off!

251
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:43,070
I'll give the "okay".

252
00:16:43,070 --> 00:16:44,760
I didn't approve that!

253
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:48,200
I know my strategies will
never fail, Noin.

254
00:16:48,430 --> 00:16:50,830
Get Space Fortress
Barge on line!

255
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,310
A Space Fortress...?

256
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:56,110
Colonel Une; Sir,
positioning is complete.

257
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:56,990
Good!

258
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:00,200
Calling all Gundam pilots.

259
00:17:00,460 --> 00:17:03,080
We are now positioned to stage
an all‐out missile attack

260
00:17:03,080 --> 00:17:04,010
on the colonies!

261
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,370
We have seized all the missile
satellites from the
former Alliance.

262
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:14,460
It's reasonable to say we
control the destiny of
all colonies!

263
00:17:16,680 --> 00:17:18,040
This isn't a bluff.

264
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,040
I demand all pilots to
surrender at once...

265
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:23,040
...and hand over your Gundams!

266
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:25,340
They've targeted the colonies!

267
00:17:25,340 --> 00:17:27,680
Hand over our Gundams?!

268
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:29,480
Sounds like OZ's tricks.

269
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,160
Hell of a time for
tasteless tactics!

270
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:35,920
You guys can fight,
well can't you?!

271
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,310
I can't fight in that case!

272
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:45,660
Noin, please. Get me Lady Une!

273
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,690
The Gundams have stopped, but
the pilots show now signs
of surrendering.

274
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:51,040
Launch a missile!

275
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:52,570
I don't care where!

276
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:55,290
Colonel! Get a grip on yourself!

277
00:17:55,290 --> 00:17:57,290
I know exactly what I'm doing!

278
00:17:57,290 --> 00:17:59,600
That isn't what His
Excellency wants!

279
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,550
I am doing nothing more than
fulfilling His
Excellency's ideal!

280
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:06,090
You clearly don't
understand His Excellency!

281
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:12,080
You're the one that doesn't
understand him, Colonel!

282
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:14,880
No, Ma'm you're wrong. Look,
Colonel Une.

283
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:17,420
The objective is to
eliminate the rebels.

284
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,590
His Excellency doesn't want
battles that involve civilians.

285
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,980
Ugh!

286
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:27,260
The colonies can be flattened
with the most minute of attacks.

287
00:18:27,390 --> 00:18:29,900
They're insignificant worlds
for the pathetic.

288
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:34,890
As for those rebels, I'll sweep
them all away with this
single command!

289
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:36,670
Launch missiles, now!

290
00:18:36,670 --> 00:18:38,000
No, don't!!

291
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:40,330
What on earth...?

292
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:41,600
Who is this guy?

293
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:45,850
Attention OZ.

294
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:50,380
I never would have imagined that
you people could be so
incredible foolish.

295
00:18:50,920 --> 00:18:54,300
The Space Colonies have no
intention of fighting OZ.

296
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,280
This is MY personal battle that
I'm staging against you!

297
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,870
Who is he?

298
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:01,610
Dr. J...

299
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,400
So the rebel's finally
showing his face!

300
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,420
Transmission is on a regular
line from outer space.

301
00:19:07,420 --> 00:19:10,410
Transmission origin:
Colony C‐1013.

302
00:19:10,410 --> 00:19:11,760
Who's this guy?

303
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,760
The person who's been
sending orders!

304
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:15,440
To someone amongst us five.

305
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:19,950
In your eyes inhumane moves such
as attacking the
colonies are just...

306
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,690
...if that's what it takes for
you to come out victorious,
right?

307
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:27,180
I have no choice but
to surrender.

308
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:29,440
Very well! Your
surrender's accepted.

309
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
Abandon your Gundams
immediately!

310
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:43,160
A boy! The Gundam pilot is
nothing more than a little boy?!

311
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:46,490
I surrender. But I will not
hand over the Gundams.

312
00:19:46,730 --> 00:19:51,420
I repeat: I surrender, but I
will not hand over the Gundams.

313
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:54,400
Mission accepted.

314
00:20:20,060 --> 00:20:21,880
Hrrgh!

315
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,740
01 just...

316
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,760
...self‐detonated...

317
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:43,240
That pilot sacrificed
his life...!

318
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,730
He self‐detonated in exchange
for the colonies?

319
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,360
He sacrificed his life without
a second thought.

320
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
The pain!...

321
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,040
My body!...

322
00:20:57,610 --> 00:20:58,650
My soul!...

323
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,450
Can you hear me? We must
leave here at once!

324
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:09,280
Trowa!

325
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,390
Is that you, Trowa?!

326
00:21:11,390 --> 00:21:13,960
Without resolutions we
cannot fight.

327
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,360
He's accepted all orders.

328
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,740
Because they bluffed with
the colonies, damn!

329
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:24,490
We can't fight any longer.

330
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,460
Hurry and move out!

331
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,120
I won't attack you in a
position like this!

332
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:49,160
All Gundams are retreating from
their respective battle points!

333
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,960
Don't expect this to be the
end of it, Gundams.

334
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:53,520
Or you, Lieutenant Noin!

335
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,480
Colonel, I have a call in
from His Excellency.

336
00:21:57,790 --> 00:21:58,410
Give it!

337
00:21:59,210 --> 00:22:00,060
Colonel...

338
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:03,000
He says for you to be
more graceful.

339
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,430
About everything.

340
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:07,480
More graceful...

341
00:22:08,330 --> 00:22:09,800
...LADY Une.

342
00:22:29,420 --> 00:22:32,410
[MUSIC]

343
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:39,480
[NARRATOR:] The Gundams
have been defeated.

344
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:43,160
With the colonies used as
shields, the warriors
don't have a chance.

345
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,960
They face a time of humiliation
when they are unable to fight.

346
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:51,230
On top of that, no one is able
to confirm whether
Heero's dead or alive.

347
00:23:51,680 --> 00:23:55,530
Relena heads to Moscow having
been informed that Lady
Une is there.

348
00:23:55,530 --> 00:24:00,040
She aims her gun straight at her
father's killer, Lady Une.

349
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:03,160
Next, on Gundam Wing,
episode 11:

350
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:05,550
"The Whereabouts of Happiness"
