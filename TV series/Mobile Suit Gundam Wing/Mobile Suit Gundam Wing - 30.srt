2
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,538
In the year After Colony 175,

3
00:01:29,538 --> 00:01:32,540
the leader of the colonies
was assassinated.

4
00:01:32,540 --> 00:01:35,873
Five Gundams were supposed
to have been sent to Earth

5
00:01:35,873 --> 00:01:36,880
to take revenge.

6
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:39,615
However, since OZ's activities
in space

7
00:01:39,783 --> 00:01:41,743
took the form of
cooperation,

8
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:45,620
rather than control, the colonies
decided to accept OZ.

9
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:49,220
In the year After Colony 195,

10
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:52,990
as OZ moves to take over
both the Earth and outer space,

11
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,300
the Gundams are labeled as rebels
and are isolated from society.

12
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:58,933
With no place to return,

13
00:01:58,933 --> 00:02:02,216
the Gundams and their pilots are
forced to fight

14
00:02:02,385 --> 00:02:03,743
for a reason to
exist

15
00:02:03,743 --> 00:02:05,600
in the ever‐changing world.

16
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,660
Hurry up and return to me, Zechs.

17
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,921
Because if you're not
around to help,

18
00:02:12,921 --> 00:02:16,100
OZ will allow worthless
actions by worthless people.

19
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,380
And now, I cannot be your
friend any more.

20
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,600
[NARRATOR:] Assault On Barge

21
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,320
I'm alive.

22
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:12,840
[VOICE:] Hey, sir!

23
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,020
Howard, take a look at him!

24
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,180
[HOWARD:] Give me a minute,
would ya?

25
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,980
Hmm. You don't look too bad.

26
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,020
Can you get up?

27
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,740
You were piloting that
interesting‐looking machine.

28
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,580
I picked it up as well.

29
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:29,900
I never would have
guessed in a million years

30
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:32,143
there’d be any pilots
other than those kids

31
00:03:32,143 --> 00:03:34,360
who’d be capable of
piloting the Tallgeese.

32
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,160
So who are you?

33
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:39,220
I'm one of the people who
was involved in its design.

34
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:41,360
Although that was a long time ago.

35
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,820
You mean you made the Tallgeese?

36
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,675
I was sailing through this area

37
00:03:46,675 --> 00:03:49,420
and I caught sight of a
pretty intense‐looking battle.

38
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,540
I decided to stick
around and watch.

39
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,000
Are you in a lot of pain?

40
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,640
Why did you bother to
save me anyway?

41
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,020
You have become OZ's enemy.

42
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:00,300
Zechs Merquise.

43
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:03,280
OZ's very own hero has
broken away from them.

44
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,640
There's no harm in
taking care of you.

45
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:08,740
That man is dead, Zechs Merquise.

46
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,740
It seems like it.

47
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:13,460
[HOWARD:] The times are changing.

48
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,580
I'd love to see the new
era while I'm still alive.

49
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,260
It's a fabulous piece
of machinery.

50
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,720
There’s good reason it's the
prototype for the Gundams.

51
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:27,085
Those rockets,

52
00:04:27,085 --> 00:04:29,940
are they vernier rockets
for atmospheric clearance?

53
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:32,875
To tell the truth, they
were originally manufactured

54
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:35,055
for the purpose of
getting the Gundams

55
00:04:35,055 --> 00:04:36,320
back into outer space.

56
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,780
Oh, by the way.

57
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:40,340
Do you think you’d be able
to make it to outer space?

58
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:41,480
Outer space?

59
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:44,400
It's about to undergo a
drastic transformation.

60
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,685
And there's a growing need

61
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:47,660
for highly skilled people
like yourself.

62
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,461
[NARRATOR:] OZ, which was
applying pressure

63
00:04:52,461 --> 00:04:55,523
on the former United Earth
Sphere Alliance Space Force

64
00:04:55,523 --> 00:04:57,185
stationed at La Grange Point,

65
00:04:57,185 --> 00:05:00,460
was steadily increasing its
strength within the colonies.

66
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:03,960
The Space Fortress Barge
was symbolic of this strength.

67
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,993
However, OZ would not
show its aggressive side

68
00:05:06,993 --> 00:05:08,880
to the citizens of the colonies.

69
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,720
Instead, it showed a completely
different aspect of itself.

70
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,230
OZ's Colonel Une replaced
the former Commander

71
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,915
of the Alliance Space Force
and succeeded in forming relations

72
00:05:20,915 --> 00:05:23,120
with representatives of
the colonies.

73
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,480
Coupled with a sense of liberation

74
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,300
from the militaristic
pressure of the Alliance,

75
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:32,620
the colonies were welcoming
OZ to its new establishment.

76
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:36,265
[COLONEL UNE:] In order to attain
peace and to coexist,

77
00:05:36,265 --> 00:05:39,585
not only in the colonies but
in the whole Earth Sphere,

78
00:05:39,585 --> 00:05:41,400
we must have your cooperation.

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,696
Unfortunately though, there are
still those within the colonies

80
00:05:44,696 --> 00:05:45,900
who are doubtful of OZ.

81
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:49,240
And who insist in pointing out
the mistakes made in the past.

82
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,450
However, I believe that
the day will come

83
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:57,460
when these people will
understand the efforts made by OZ.

84
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,800
That’s my belief.

85
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,360
We feel they'll change
their minds as well.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,080
And we're desperately trying to
convince each of the colonies.

87
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:08,180
On the other hand, we have
no means to counter violence.

88
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:09,780
That's what OZ is here for.

89
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,340
As long as OZ is present

90
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:14,500
I have no doubt that justice
will be served, Gentlemen.

91
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:17,700
If Colonel Une says so,
then there's no need to worry.

92
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:19,511
Once peace spreads into space

93
00:06:19,511 --> 00:06:22,208
even those who still
harbor doubts toward OZ

94
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:23,740
will awaken to the truth.

95
00:06:23,740 --> 00:06:25,020
Yes.

96
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,500
[OZ SOLDIER:] Colonel Une!

97
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,160
We now have the item in question.

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:30,960
Huh?

99
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,380
[OZ SOLDIER:] Colonel,
please return to Barge.

100
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,380
[COLONEL UNE:] To Barge?

101
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:39,200
[OZ SOLDIER:] They’re
orders from His Excellency.

102
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:42,420
His Excellency Treize...

103
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:49,000
[COLONEL UNE:] I'll
return to Barge.

104
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:53,180
[COLONEL UNE:] Are you certain?

105
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:54,300
There’s no question.

106
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,800
It's the HLV carrier that left
Earth carrying a Gundam.

107
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,173
The Gundams are evil

108
00:06:59,173 --> 00:07:01,780
and will cause damage
to the colonies.

109
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,560
They'd be valuable
as our scapegoats of evil.

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:07,120
Bring out the Tauruses!
Capture it!

111
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,800
What do we do with the pilot?

112
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,780
Depends on his looks.

113
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:11,480
Huh?

114
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:13,500
[COLONEL UNE:] If he's ugly,
let him live.

115
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:15,888
If there’s a chance people
might sympathize with him,

116
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:16,480
then kill him.

117
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:18,330
We can't have anything
get in the way

118
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,380
of changing the general
public’s minds.

119
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,100
Let him live if he's ugly? Really?

120
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,200
[LAUGHS] Just kidding.

121
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,860
[SOLDIER #1:] We have
confirmation on the carrier.

122
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,020
It's an HLV from Singapore
used to transport a Gundam.

123
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,540
No energy detected.

124
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:40,900
It's a miracle that it was able to
fly this far without refueling.

125
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,080
[SOLDIER #2:] It’s possible
that nobody’s on it.

126
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,340
[SOLDIER #1:] Regardless,
orders are to capture it.

127
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:50,040
We'll tow it along to
Colony C1102.

128
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:50,940
[SOLDIER #2:] Roger!

129
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,560
[SOLDIER #1:] What?

130
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:09,060
It’s quite an honor, being
greeted by your latest model.

131
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,205
But let me warn you

132
00:08:10,205 --> 00:08:13,100
that anyone carelessly
approaching is gonna die!

133
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,100
[SOLDIER #1:] Taurus mobile dolls,
attack!

134
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,460
They're fast!

135
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:41,140
So that didn't work either!

136
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,220
Zero output, huh?

137
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:57,220
Well, if Deathscythe goes down, I
don't have long myself.

138
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:59,880
But still, I'll die fighting!

139
00:09:05,680 --> 00:09:09,500
Gundam, you're just lucky
I wasn't a mobile doll.

140
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:31,640
[DUO:] I don't want to copy Heero,
but...

141
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,580
Tag along, on my
journey into hell!!

142
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,380
Not my lucky day.

143
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:47,620
Can't even self‐detonate.

144
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:49,620
Or maybe I am lucky.

145
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,380
[NEWSCASTER:] One of the
Gundam mobile suits

146
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:10,608
known for their destruction
and threat to peace

147
00:10:10,608 --> 00:10:12,220
was shot down by OZ's Taurus unit.

148
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,220
The Gundam pilot has
been arrested.

149
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,620
The background of this pilot
has not been confirmed.

150
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,596
But OZ has commented
that their arrest

151
00:10:21,596 --> 00:10:23,746
will assist them as they
increase efforts

152
00:10:23,746 --> 00:10:26,640
to eradicate rebels and their
respective organizations.

153
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,905
The colony governments
have responded

154
00:10:28,905 --> 00:10:31,300
by announcing full
cooperation on this matter.

155
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:33,640
It is hoped that with the
joint cooperation

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:35,386
of OZ and the colony governments

157
00:10:35,386 --> 00:10:37,860
we will soon be able to
return to total peace.

158
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,810
Are the people of the colonies
so accustomed to being controlled

159
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:44,198
that nobody can figure out the
Gundams

I'll kill them all.

318
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,060
Oh Heero.

319
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,220
[HEERO:] I’ll eliminate
all obstacles.

320
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:59,500
This is going a bit overboard
just to get one person into space.

321
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,480
Outer space is rejecting humans.

322
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,320
And come to think of it,

323
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,268
perhaps the Earth is trying
to tell us we're mistaken

324
00:22:15,268 --> 00:22:17,160
by pulling us back down toward it.

325
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:38,180
[ENDING MUSIC]

326
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:43,120
The five scientists start
developing

327
00:23:43,288 --> 00:23:45,180
OZ's newest mobile suits:

328
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:46,920
Mercurius and Vayeate.

329
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,435
In an attempt to stop them,

330
00:23:49,435 --> 00:23:53,360
Heero sneaks into the Lunar Base
by himself to assassinate them.

331
00:23:54,200 --> 00:23:57,860
But he's stopped in his tracks
by none other than Trowa.

332
00:23:58,220 --> 00:24:01,500
Next, on Gundam Wing Episode 20:

333
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,720
The Lunar Base Infiltration
