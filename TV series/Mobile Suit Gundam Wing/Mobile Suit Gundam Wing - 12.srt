Father, please escape!

3
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,758
Quatre, what I’m
doing is escaping.

4
00:01:31,758 --> 00:01:34,511
I'm not going to put up a fight.

5
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:38,641
There is no end to this fight,
so I've opted to run away.

6
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:41,811
If I end up dying, then so be it.

7
00:01:41,811 --> 00:01:43,730
I'm not so attached to space that

8
00:01:43,898 --> 00:01:45,815
I’m prepared to compromise myself!

9
00:01:45,815 --> 00:01:48,601

[NARRATOR:] The Fight
for Independence

14
00:02:22,518 --> 00:02:23,811
This is massive!

15
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:26,856
I wonder what kind of person this
goodwill ambassador is.

16
00:02:26,856 --> 00:02:28,023
[NICHOL:] Gentlemen!

17
00:02:28,023 --> 00:02:30,901
That mobile suit was used
against OZ on Earth,

18
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:33,318
we’ll check it for
security reasons, sir.

19
00:02:53,173 --> 00:02:56,426
The new system since OZ
and the colonies became united

20
00:02:56,426 --> 00:02:58,930
has had a considerable
influence on Earth.

21
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:01,103
On behalf of my nation, I've come
here

22
00:03:01,271 --> 00:03:03,851
so I might find out more about
this situation.

23
00:03:03,851 --> 00:03:05,018
Your nation?

24
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:06,478
Yes, my nation.

25
00:03:06,478 --> 00:03:08,805
I've come here from the Sanc
Kingdom

26
00:03:08,973 --> 00:03:11,233
and my name is Milliardo
Peacecraft.

27
00:03:11,233 --> 00:03:13,170
Oh, His Excellency has had ties

28
00:03:13,338 --> 00:03:15,655
with the Sanc Kingdom
since his youth.

29
00:03:15,655 --> 00:03:17,906
But I’d heard your nation
was recovering

30
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:20,243
from the strike that was
caused by the wars.

31
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:22,356
As an individual I think I
understand

32
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:23,830
the implications of
war.

33
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:26,581
So I thought I could give
advice to the colonies

34
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:28,500
desiring their own military power.

35
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,836
There are quite a few ways in
which to obtain peace for oneself.

36
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,090
I’m sure that between
what each of us has learned,

37
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:35,758
we'll find the best
direction to take.

38
00:03:35,758 --> 00:03:38,803
Then will you give me the
latitude to act on my own accord

39
00:03:38,803 --> 00:03:40,053
while I'm here in space?

40
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:41,973
Yes, of course, that’s fine.

41
00:03:41,973 --> 00:03:46,768
You might very well be on the
track to peace, Representative.

42
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,270
Peacecraft, huh?

43
00:03:48,270 --> 00:03:52,566
He's none other than that
OZ traitor, Zechs Merquise!

44
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,278
[NARRATOR:] Space Colony D120.

45
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:58,615
Where the command station for
the United Earth Sphere Alliance

46
00:03:58,615 --> 00:03:59,531
had been located.

47
00:03:59,531 --> 00:04:02,785
OZ wasn't currently controlling
the colonies by force

48
00:04:02,785 --> 00:04:07,165
but by providing council on its
own admission into the colonies.

49
00:04:07,165 --> 00:04:11,835
D120 continued in its function
as Earth's voice in outer space

50
00:04:11,835 --> 00:04:16,923
without forgoing its position as a
military organization from Earth.

51
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,975
Gwinter, son of the fmr Alliance
Space Force Commander,

52
00:04:20,143 --> 00:04:22,930
General Septem, was the
representative of this colony.

53
00:04:22,930 --> 00:04:25,725
The former Alliance members
surrounding him,

54
00:04:25,725 --> 00:04:27,966
had been pointing out
problems with

55
00:04:28,135 --> 00:04:31,021
the colonial independence
policy backed by OZ.

56
00:04:31,021 --> 00:04:33,023
Now what are you hesitating for?

57
00:04:33,023 --> 00:04:35,568
OZ is trying to secure
more power for themselves

58
00:04:35,568 --> 00:04:37,986
and we’ve got to do
something to stop them.

59
00:04:37,986 --> 00:04:42,075
Technological strength will just
become a threat to the Earth.

60
00:04:42,075 --> 00:04:44,403
OZ is thinking of space
as nothing more

61
00:04:44,571 --> 00:04:46,536
than a factory for military goods.

62
00:04:46,536 --> 00:04:48,413
We’re the only ones that
can stop them.

63
00:04:48,413 --> 00:04:49,540
It's our mission!

64
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,210
A battle will result in
many casualties.

65
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:54,198
Dialogue is still an option at
this point,

66
00:04:54,366 --> 00:04:55,921
considering our military strength.

67
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,798
They're planning to
use outer space

68
00:04:57,798 --> 00:05:00,385
to develop and manufacture
their mobile dolls.

69
00:05:00,385 --> 00:05:02,558
These murder weapons
will allow OZ to

70
00:05:02,726 --> 00:05:05,138
easily take over and dictate the
colonies.

71
00:05:05,138 --> 00:05:10,770
[GWINTER:] Does everybody
feel the same way?

72
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,981
Zechs Merquise has
arrived here in space.

73
00:05:13,981 --> 00:05:17,110
Zechs? The Lightning Count
is still alive?

74
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,530
The Earth fears the increased
armament in space the most.

75
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:23,490
Zechs knows OZ well and
he wishes for peace on Earth,

76
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,785
so we should set aside some time
to hear what he has to say.

77
00:05:26,785 --> 00:05:28,453
What’s Zechs doing in space?

78
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,540
He has nothing to do
with OZ anymore.

79
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:34,001
He’s one man who holds a
great affection for his homeland.

80
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,393
I’m sure he knew it was risky but
he felt

81
00:05:36,561 --> 00:05:38,421
that someone had to do something.

82
00:05:38,421 --> 00:05:40,800
This visit holds significance.

83
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,720
Very nicely done,
Treize Kushrenada!

84
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,596
Outer space is close to
accepting OZ.

85
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:47,848
[TREIZE:] So it seems.

86
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,601
And Colonel Une's achievements
have been impressive.

87
00:05:50,601 --> 00:05:52,473
She's succeeded in forming
friendly

88
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:54,730
relations with one colony after
another.

89
00:05:54,730 --> 00:05:57,441
The sense of independence
built by forming a nation

90
00:05:57,441 --> 00:05:59,278
will trigger the mindset to
develop

91
00:05:59,446 --> 00:06:00,695
productivity and defense.

92
00:06:00,695 --> 00:06:03,488
This leads to the nation
becoming militaristic.

93
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,991
Which means that every country on
the Earth will jump into OZ's arms

94
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,078
practically begging to
be governed by us.

95
00:06:09,078 --> 00:06:10,245
It's beautiful, Treize.

96
00:06:10,245 --> 00:06:14,000
You've made outer space a member
of the Romefeller Foundation.

97
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,291
[TUBAROV:] Excuse me, sir.

98
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,211
Oh, Mr. Tubarov; have you
finished packing?

99
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,921
Yes.

100
00:06:19,921 --> 00:06:22,216
[DERMAIL:] Tubarov is
heading for outer space

101
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:25,720
to oversee mobile doll production
to strengthen our military force.

102
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,971
Une has readily accepted
the new addition.

103
00:06:27,971 --> 00:06:29,874
Lady Une did?

104
00:06:29,874 --> 00:06:32,866
Colonel Une seems to be very
pleased indeed

105
00:06:32,866 --> 00:06:34,226
with the mobile
dolls!

106
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:42,195
[UNE:] Your Excellency, it's a
while since we last spoke.

107
00:06:42,195 --> 00:06:43,278
It's Lady Une here.

108
00:06:43,278 --> 00:06:44,946
Lady Une?

109
00:06:44,946 --> 00:06:47,866
I almost convinced myself
you'd be coming here

110
00:06:47,866 --> 00:06:49,660
with Chief Engineer Tubarov.

111
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,078
Yes, I want to talk to
you about that.

112
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:55,123
Just how are you planning
to utilize the mobile dolls?

113
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,731
I'll use them as your soldiers in
such a way

114
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,670
that won’t cause you
grievance.

115
00:06:59,670 --> 00:07:00,963
[TREIZE:] My soldiers?

116
00:07:00,963 --> 00:07:05,091
[UNE:] You're not being fair,
Your Excellency.

117
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:07,720
You're the person who must
lead this world.

118
00:07:07,720 --> 00:07:11,431
But you've simply left this world
in a state of utter confusion.

119
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:12,903
I came here to outer space

120
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,351
in order to be of
some assistance to you.

121
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:19,106
And I've also laid out a new
future for you, Your Excellency.

122
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,525
Fighting will never
disappear from this world.

123
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:24,903
In which case, the strongest
should rule the world.

124
00:07:24,903 --> 00:07:27,325
It’s a fact that people even feel
pleasure

125
00:07:27,493 --> 00:07:29,741
when they’re being controlled by
others.

126
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:33,328
It's merely natural for the
world to continue fighting.

127
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:36,206
But that encourages
meaningless bloodshed.

128
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:39,585
Your excellency, you’re
capable of loving all people.

129
00:07:39,585 --> 00:07:42,380
You have a heart that
can make you a god.

130
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:46,300
You can create peace on
Earth from here in space.

131
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,690
Lady, you’re only thinking of your
own ideals

132
00:07:48,858 --> 00:07:50,386
when you envision that
future.

133
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:54,558
[UNE:] It's what you wanted,
Your Excellency.

134
00:07:54,558 --> 00:07:58,770
My ideal is nothing more than the
fantasy of a single individual.

135
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:01,523
History is an accumulation
of daily events.

136
00:08:01,523 --> 00:08:04,401
I have no interest in an
individual's future.

137
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,528
Your future's already
been determined.

138
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:09,948
Your future's destined to be
right here in outer space.

139
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:13,201
Lady Une, I'm not as strong
as you think I am.

140
00:08:13,201 --> 00:08:16,121
Zechs and the Gundam
pilots are making an effort

141
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,415
to construct a new
future as we speak.

142
00:08:18,415 --> 00:08:20,000
There's no need to hurry.

143
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,253
History will repeat itself.

144
00:08:22,253 --> 00:08:23,253
Lady.

145
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,213
Please, come back to me.

146
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:28,046
The Lady Une that I used
to be so fond of.

147
00:08:34,181 --> 00:08:35,181
Yes.

148
00:08:35,181 --> 00:08:37,435
It's Zechs Merquise,
without a question.

149
00:08:37,435 --> 00:08:39,853
So Zechs is in space, is he?

150
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:42,116
Establishing relations with the
Military Colony

151
00:08:42,285 --> 00:08:43,398
of the former
Alliance.

152
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:44,525
Lieutenant Nichol.

153
00:08:44,525 --> 00:08:46,276
Destroy the
Alliance's Space Force.

154
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,695
There's no reason to leave
them roaming about,

155
00:08:48,695 --> 00:08:51,115
now that the mobile dolls
have been completed.

156
00:08:51,115 --> 00:08:52,198
Yes, sir!

157
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:56,120
[DERMAIL:] I’ve also sent Colonel
Une orders for the near future.

158
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,165
Tell her I’d like to receive her

159
00:08:59,165 --> 00:09:00,256
Sir.

160
00:09:08,048 --> 00:09:11,343
Welcome, I realize we did
become enemies at one point.

161
00:09:11,343 --> 00:09:15,346
But changes in wartime also bring
about changes in relationships.

162
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:17,085
[ZECHS:] I care about the Earth,

163
00:09:17,253 --> 00:09:19,268
just as you people
of the Alliance do.

164
00:09:19,268 --> 00:09:20,895
I heard you came from Earth

165
00:09:20,895 --> 00:09:24,648
to discuss the current armaments
issue of the space colonies.

166
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:27,485
If this was just a matter of a
new military nation being formed

167
00:09:27,485 --> 00:09:28,735
then I wouldn't be worried.

168
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,613
However, if it turns out
they’re being tricked by OZ

169
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:33,531
then I can't sit back
and ignore it.

170
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:37,536
OZ is planning to use space
as their military factory.

171
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:40,455
That would result in even
more severe disputes on Earth

172
00:09:40,455 --> 00:09:42,416
and would lead to
serious casualties.

173
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:47,170
Tell us how you feel about the
people in space, Mr. Peacecraft?

174
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,086
The teachings of the great leader,

175
00:09:49,255 --> 00:09:51,341
the late Heero Yuy,
are still with us.

176
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:53,343
Outer space once
thrived as a world

177
00:09:53,343 --> 00:09:55,881
which was neither polluted by
Earth's history

178
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:57,390
nor in need of armaments.

179
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,791
The colonies set an example for
all of

180
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:01,851
Earth's peace‐oriented nations.

181
00:10:01,851 --> 00:10:04,313
They set an example.

182
00:10:04,313 --> 00:10:08,650
If only the people in space had
heard those words a bit sooner.

183
00:10:08,650 --> 00:10:10,653
Perhaps they would not
have changed their minds.

184
00:10:10,653 --> 00:10:13,023
Why not just tell Mr. Peacecraft
here about

185
00:10:13,191 --> 00:10:14,948
the people of the space colonies?

186
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:18,243
And the reason we
decided to stay in space.

187
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,870
The reason you stayed here?

188
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:20,913
Ahh, right.

189
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:23,456
Back when the Alliance was
defeated by OZ,

190
00:10:23,456 --> 00:10:26,876
our first thought was to
immediately offer to surrender.

191
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:30,505
However, it was our opinion at
the time that by surrendering,

192
00:10:30,505 --> 00:10:33,550
we would be leaving outer
space in a great turmoil.

193
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:37,513
The space colonies is a realm
of precise calculations.

194
00:10:37,513 --> 00:10:40,693
This management center was always
supporting

195
00:10:40,861 --> 00:10:42,518
this colony's life
zone.

196
00:10:42,518 --> 00:10:44,478
The colony's rotation operations,

197
00:10:44,478 --> 00:10:46,980
checking the condition of
the atmosphere,

198
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:48,606
management of the weather.

199
00:10:48,606 --> 00:10:51,985
Natural phenomena that is
taken for granted on Earth

200
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,198
is generated by man‐made
machinery

201
00:10:54,366 --> 00:10:55,990
controlled by people
here.

202
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,468
To live in this atmosphere,

203
00:10:57,636 --> 00:11:00,118
there was a need to
change people’s awareness.

204
00:11:00,118 --> 00:11:02,830
There's insecurity, yes.

205
00:11:02,830 --> 00:11:05,081
Unless you can completely
ignore insecurity

206
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,543
you'll have a lot of
difficulties living here.

207
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,796
And the insecure people
feel the need for weapons.

208
00:11:10,796 --> 00:11:14,300
Because weapons can provide
people with a sense of security.

209
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:18,095
Then at what point can one get rid
of that sense of insecurity?

210
00:11:18,095 --> 00:11:21,556
Outer space will attack the Earth,
in their search

211
00:11:21,725 --> 00:11:23,308
for more stable
grounds.

212
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,770
[ALARM]

213
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,480
It's an OZ mobile suit
transport vessel.

214
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,483
Looks like they're finally
going to attack us!

215
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,735
I'd like to be part of
your counterattack.

216
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,973
But we can’t have a goodwill
ambassador

217
00:11:36,141 --> 00:11:37,740
getting involved in a battle!

218
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,533
I switch between two masks.

219
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:44,174
My experience in battle has taught
me to be cunning like that.

220
00:11:57,593 --> 00:11:58,426
Colonel!

221
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,428
Oh, I beg your pardon.

222
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,265
That's fine, come in, please.

223
00:12:03,265 --> 00:12:05,976
This is the Romefeller
Foundation's plan

224
00:12:06,145 --> 00:12:09,061
to send mobile dolls made in space
to Earth.

225
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:13,400
In order to resolve all
disputes on Earth at once?

226
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:16,070
Everybody comes to
that conclusion.

227
00:12:16,070 --> 00:12:20,168
But personally I have no intention
of sending mobile dolls to Earth.

228
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,665
The Romefeller Foundation's plan
will mean more bloodshed on Earth.

229
00:12:27,665 --> 00:12:30,208
The strong shall come to
rule the Earth.

230
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:33,170
That's all that’s needed
for us to attain peace.

231
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,966
But now His Excellency has refused
his mission to rule the world.

232
00:12:37,966 --> 00:12:40,343
His Excellency?

233
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:43,513
True public order in this world
will never be possible

234
00:12:43,513 --> 00:12:46,058
unless His Excellency comes
to outer space.

235
00:12:46,058 --> 00:12:50,020
There isn’t any point in my
staying here any longer.

236
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:51,480
That’s not true.

237
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:54,983
You still have your duty here
to serve as an OZ soldier.

238
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:57,360
As an OZ soldier?

239
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,488
In the end, you'd be doing
him a favor by staying.

240
00:13:00,488 --> 00:13:03,200
A soldier should only worry
about following orders.

241
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,828
Colonel, you're a leader who
stands above the soldiers.

242
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:09,965
But your superior abilities can be
greater magnified

243
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:11,083
as an OZ
soldier.

244
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:14,043
I implore you, Colonel Une,
to serve as an OZ soldier.

245
00:13:14,043 --> 00:13:17,005
Not to guide His Excellency,
but rather to support him.

246
00:13:17,005 --> 00:13:20,758
As an OZ soldier to
support Master Treize?

247
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:23,470
I’m sure that's what His
Excellency desires.

248
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:29,268
Master Treize, he...desires that,
huh?

249
00:13:29,268 --> 00:13:31,311
[OZ SOLDIER:] Mobile dolls
have started a battle

250
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:33,188
in the Area A of the
Alliance Military Base.

251
00:13:33,188 --> 00:13:35,468
They'll be in range of Barge's
beam cannon

252
00:13:35,636 --> 00:13:36,816
in T‐Minus 600 seconds.

253
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,426
[NICHOL:] Can we damage the
Alliance Colony

254
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:39,320
with the beam cannon?

255
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,905
[OZ SOLDIER:] If we can destroy
their electrical power control

256
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:44,241
and management facilities,
one shot should wipe it out.

257
00:13:44,241 --> 00:13:45,075
[NICHOL:] Okay!

258
00:13:45,075 --> 00:13:47,308
I’ve heard many civilians live
there,

259
00:13:47,476 --> 00:13:49,161
along with military officers.

260
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,455
They're employees.

261
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,218
They'd surely know there’s always
a risk living in

262
00:13:53,386 --> 00:13:54,418
a military
fortress.

263
00:13:54,418 --> 00:13:57,211
Has Colonel Une been
informed of your plans here?

264
00:13:57,211 --> 00:13:59,840
I'm acting on direct orders
from Duke Dermail!

265
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,176
We're to crush them along with
that OZ traitor Zechs Merquise.

266
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,261
I'll get the Mercurius
and Vayeate ready.

267
00:14:05,261 --> 00:14:07,263
Stop right there, Trowa Barton!

268
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:10,100
I won’t let you go near
the mobile suit gate.

269
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:12,145
I don't trust traitors regardless
of

270
00:14:12,313 --> 00:14:14,186
whether they're enemies or allies!

271
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:16,731
And Lady Une isn't aware
of this either?

272
00:14:16,731 --> 00:14:18,593
The Colonel has left to take part
in

273
00:14:18,761 --> 00:14:20,360
the battle against the Alliance.

274
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,905
She left me in charge of
operations here.

275
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:26,075
Restrain this man at once!

276
00:14:26,075 --> 00:14:28,365
I have no intention of
overstepping

277
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,495
my boundaries as an OZ soldier.

278
00:14:30,495 --> 00:14:32,716
It’s just I have doubts about your
plan

279
00:14:32,885 --> 00:14:34,875
not to use the Vayeate and
Mercurius

280
00:14:34,875 --> 00:14:38,836
to support the Colonel's troops.
That’s all.

281
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:41,756
A soldier doesn't need to be
thinking so much.

282
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:45,010
Ideals about peace are for
people in the top ranks.

283
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,827
All we need to do is
pursue victory.

284
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,541
Get closer!

285
00:15:17,541 --> 00:15:20,170
Make up for reaction time
in close‐range combat!

286
00:15:24,215 --> 00:15:26,510
I did it! All right!

287
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,180
What?!

288
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,223
[SOLDIER #1:] We've lost
50% of our Leos!

289
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:35,185
[SOLDIER #2:] We believe all the
enemy Tauruses are mobile dolls!

290
00:15:35,185 --> 00:15:37,228
[SOLDIER #1:] 20% of our
defenses are gone!

291
00:15:37,228 --> 00:15:39,190
Have the remaining civilians
living

292
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,150
in the colony all been evacuated?

293
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:41,691
Yes.

294
00:15:41,691 --> 00:15:44,861
They left on our large shuttle and
are headed for safe grounds.

295
00:15:44,861 --> 00:15:48,656
In any case, mobile dolls alone
cannot destroy this colony.

296
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:51,993
I expect that Barge will be
making the final blow.

297
00:15:51,993 --> 00:15:54,496
This colony about
ready to go under.

298
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,956
What’s that supposed to mean,
Grandfather?

299
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,510
This is the first time a colony
was destroyed

300
00:15:59,678 --> 00:16:02,003
in war ever since the colonies
were built.

301
00:16:02,003 --> 00:16:04,576
All of mankind needs to be shown
how

302
00:16:04,745 --> 00:16:07,676
terribly tragic the destruction
really is.

303
00:16:07,676 --> 00:16:09,970
We who brought military
power to space,

304
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:12,596
and the colonies who are
considering it now,

305
00:16:12,596 --> 00:16:14,641
must engrave this in our memories,

306
00:16:14,641 --> 00:16:16,643
so the wrong path won't be taken.

307
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,228
It hardly compensates for
what we've done,

308
00:16:19,228 --> 00:16:22,481
but I hope our deaths send
the message, I do.

309
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:24,308
[GWINTER:] I’m terribly sorry to
have

310
00:16:24,476 --> 00:16:26,153
dragged you into this,
Grandfather.

311
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:28,405
[GRANDFATHER:] Those are my
thoughts exactly.

312
00:16:28,405 --> 00:16:30,018
I'm sorry, Gwinter.

313
00:16:49,091 --> 00:16:50,718
Barge's beam cannon?

314
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:52,836
Are they seriously going
to wipe out the colony?

315
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:06,401
Treize is hoping that we will
both put up a good fight.

316
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:10,863
Isn’t it possible for even you
to create a future, Treize?

317
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:14,116
There's no choice left
but to battle.

318
00:17:14,116 --> 00:17:18,746
It's the only way that remains.

319
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:21,483
Without fighting, nothing
can be created.

320
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:28,173
What’s this?

321
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,550
[ZECHS:] Treize!

322
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:32,051
[TREIZE:] Zechs Merquise.

323
00:17:32,051 --> 00:17:35,555
Or rather, my eternal friend,
Milliardo Peacecraft.

324
00:17:35,555 --> 00:17:39,685
I'm delighted to hear that you've
shown up in outer space.

325
00:17:39,685 --> 00:17:44,146
OZ is changing, and I found that
I’m sorely lacking in power.

326
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:48,428
Romefeller's way, or rather the
path that mankind is taking,

327
00:17:48,596 --> 00:17:49,945
is just too
selfish.

328
00:17:49,945 --> 00:17:52,280
I never expected their
increased power

329
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:55,533
would result in abandoning
the true heart of humans.

330
00:17:55,533 --> 00:17:59,328
I used to believe that OZ's duty
were not to take part in war.

331
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:02,498
But to educate soldiers that
had the heart to fight.

332
00:18:02,498 --> 00:18:05,140
But eventually the battles can be
fought

333
00:18:05,308 --> 00:18:07,086
without even needing humans.

334
00:18:07,086 --> 00:18:08,380
[ZECHS:] I'm a soldier.

335
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:12,508
I chose of my own free will
to resist that eventuality.

336
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:13,426
Milliardo.

337
00:18:13,426 --> 00:18:15,985
At the moment, I don't have the
power to

338
00:18:16,153 --> 00:18:18,390
alter the path chosen by
Romefeller.

339
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:22,643
I'm just glad to speak with
someone who understands me.

340
00:18:22,643 --> 00:18:26,773
Milliardo, there's one other
person who understands me.

341
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:30,818
Her feelings toward me have caused
her to have split personalities.

342
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:32,445
Lady Une?

343
00:18:32,445 --> 00:18:35,698
I'm making the person closest
to me feel insecure.

344
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:38,868
I've got no right to talk
about the future.

345
00:18:38,868 --> 00:18:41,246
Milliardo. I implore you.

346
00:18:41,246 --> 00:18:42,559
You’ve got to save her.

347
00:18:56,051 --> 00:19:00,552
I'm going to fight for Treize
to help realize his ideal!

348
00:19:08,356 --> 00:19:10,275
[OZ SOLDIER:] Alliance
Colony within range.

349
00:19:10,275 --> 00:19:11,860
Fire the beam cannon, now!

350
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,445
[OZ SOLDIER:] But Colonel Une
is still on the battlegrounds!

351
00:19:14,445 --> 00:19:17,406
That doesn't matter, just follow
your orders, soldier!

352
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,131
The Colonel’s aware
of the dangers!

353
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:26,171
What’s going on?

354
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:36,819
Lady Une would cancel any
order to attack the colony.

355
00:19:40,013 --> 00:19:43,122
She's learned just how fragile
the colonies actually are.

356
00:19:47,645 --> 00:19:48,980
They missed it!

357
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,150
Was that intentional?

358
00:19:52,150 --> 00:19:55,778
Take me there.

359
00:19:55,778 --> 00:19:58,483
Take me to the Fortress Barge,
now.

360
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,751
Colonel, you're safe!

361
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:12,836
Colonel?

362
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:17,216
Nichol, I learned a great
deal out there as a soldier today.

363
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:18,801
Very informative.

364
00:20:18,801 --> 00:20:22,263
And as your superior, I cannot
overlook what you've done.

365
00:20:22,263 --> 00:20:23,390
Colonel!

366
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:26,476
The actions you took were
right on the mark.

367
00:20:26,476 --> 00:20:30,005
But then again, what I'm about
to do is also on the mark!

368
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,450
Treize.

369
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,076
I've got no power.

370
00:20:43,076 --> 00:20:45,120
In the confusion of all
these battles

371
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,040
I’m still only able to walk
the path of a soldier.

372
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:50,666
[NARRATOR:] The Romefeller
Foundation decides

373
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,216
they will build mobile doll

374
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,461
manufacturing
facilities on the moon.

375
00:20:54,461 --> 00:20:57,090
The mobile dolls to be
mass‐produced here

376
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:59,550
will be used as weapons
against Earth.

377
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:02,073
The strategy is to send them to
Earth and

378
00:21:02,241 --> 00:21:04,765
quickly resolve the many disputes
on Earth

379
00:21:04,765 --> 00:21:09,185
by wiping out those on the
other side of the disputes.

380
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:11,145
With these ultimate weapons,

381
00:21:11,145 --> 00:21:14,133
the world is headed to an age
where

382
00:21:14,301 --> 00:21:16,776
soldiers are no longer needed.

383
00:21:16,776 --> 00:21:19,111
[OZ SOLDIER:] Unidentified
object headed this way!

384
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,446
What?

385
00:21:20,446 --> 00:21:21,490
[OZ SOLDIER:] It's a Gundam!

386
00:21:21,490 --> 00:21:23,241
A Gundam has found us!

387
00:21:23,241 --> 00:21:26,828
Assassinate the mobile dolls'
Chief Engineer?

388
00:21:26,828 --> 00:21:28,913
That's an easy mission for Wufei.

389
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:33,376
Troops from the Lunar Base are
headed for the Gundam!

390
00:21:33,376 --> 00:21:36,321
I have no bullets, no fuel and
hardly any

391
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,715
propulsive energy left any more.

392
00:21:38,715 --> 00:21:41,258
Here, Mr. Chief Engineer.

393
00:21:41,258 --> 00:21:46,765
My life's completely
in your hands.

394
00:21:46,765 --> 00:21:48,141
Full retreat!

395
00:21:48,141 --> 00:21:50,768
Wait, take a look!

396
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:54,563
The Gundam no longer
has the power to retaliate.

397
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:56,273
Interesting machine.

398
00:21:56,273 --> 00:22:01,236
I wouldn’t mind taking it to the
Lunar Base and checking it out.

399
00:22:01,236 --> 00:22:02,530
[TUBAROV:] Calling Lunar Base.

400
00:22:02,530 --> 00:22:04,825
Stop your attack and
capture the Gundam.

401
00:22:04,825 --> 00:22:10,455
[OZ SOLDIER:] Yes, sir!

402
00:22:10,455 --> 00:22:13,583
That's very kind of you, Mr.
Chief Engineer.

403
00:22:13,583 --> 00:22:17,586
Nataku, you and I have to
become a whole lot stronger.

404
00:22:17,586 --> 00:22:19,671
I hear they have a factory.

405
00:22:19,671 --> 00:22:22,058
Maybe they'll help us
get stronger.

406
00:22:29,850 --> 00:23:39,168
[ENDING MUSIC]

407
00:23:39,168 --> 00:23:42,171
[NARRATOR:] The people in outer
space get their hands on weapons

408
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,800
in order to defend the colonies
from

409
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:45,133
a feared attack from Earth.

410
00:23:45,133 --> 00:23:47,276
But it is OZ that manipulates
their

411
00:23:47,445 --> 00:23:48,845
fears behind the scenes.

412
00:23:48,845 --> 00:23:51,398
To prevent mass‐production of
mobile dolls,

413
00:23:51,566 --> 00:23:53,641
Duo heads to destroy the Lunar
Base.

414
00:23:53,641 --> 00:23:57,311
During the battle with the
Colony’s volunteer soldier Hilde,

415
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:59,981
Duo sees the confused future
of the colonies.
