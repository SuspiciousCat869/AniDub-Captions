[NARRATOR:] The attacks
by the five Gundams

retaliatory intentions.

5
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,920
The Gundams’ target is OZ,

00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,155
who had masked
its identity within

00:01:36,323 --> 00:01:39,580

the alliance military.

The Gundams had a number
of missions to attack OZ.

The year is After Colony 195.

OZ has finally
taken center stage.

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:54,200
With an army of elite
soldiers at his command,

to destroy the
Alliance military.

The battle between the mobile
suits sent to Earth and OZ,

15
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:06,140

shudder violently.

He's not requesting this
as a soldier of OZ.

the OZ pilot that
fought the Gundam.

But he's already moved
from the Lake Victoria base

00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,120
and I can't get in
touch with him.

In other words, we still
don't know anything, right?

89
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:18,180
I have been able to
find out one thing.

What's that?

91
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,700
Colonel Zechs did something
that’s highly peculiar.

92

Peculiar?

93
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,930
Soon after the
battle in Siberia,

94
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:29,020
Colonel Zechs ordered a large
amount of Gundanium

95
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:31,420
to be shipped to him
from outer space.

96
00:06:31,420 --> 00:06:33,971
So that he could reconstruct the
Gundam

97
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:35,880
from the remains, you mean.

98
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:38,570
Even I know he was ordered
to destroy the Gundam

99
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:41,100
because the OZ hardliners
found out about it.

100
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,010
Actually, there are
some indications

101
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,900
that the Gundam
which was destroyed

102
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,800
might've been no
more than a dummy.

103
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,760
A dummy?

104
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:50,760
They apparently had so much
Gundanium alloy shipped

105
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,120
they'd easily be able to make
two mobile suits out of it.

106
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:56,640
So they used a portion of
it to build the dummy,

107
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:58,453
and now they're
using the rest of it

108
00:06:58,621 --> 00:06:59,960
to reconstruct the Gundam.

109
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:00,580
[BUTLER:] Yes.

00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,860
What is it that makes that
Gundam so special, anyway?

111
00:07:03,860 --> 00:07:07,160
He wants to have one final match
to decide things.

112
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,700
That’s the kind of person he is.

when he was about six,

You know this Colonel Zechs
man, then?

119

He was a hero in the
eyes of the Peacecrafts.

There are many stories
of his bravery.

If only I could get in touch
with Colonel Zechs,

then I might be able to find
out what happened to Heero.

anything to cause me trouble.

161
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,500
Everyone's just worrying
about this too much.

162
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,180
So it was one of
the OZ carriers.

163
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,100
Was it now?

164
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,540
Then there's a good chance
they're aboard the plane.

165
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,660
Do you think we should
just leave them alone?

166
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,760
Be patient and don't
lose sight of them.

167
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,560
They're bound to show their
true colors sooner or later.

168
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:38,540
Sir.

169
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,400
I won't be letting them
have their way this time around.

170
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,920
Has the left arm be
automatically balanced

171
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,560
to account for the extra weight?

172
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,100
No, I avoided that on purpose.

173
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,440
I forced myself to remember
the weight difference

174
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,740
so I would have a speed
advantage during battle.

175
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:11,400
Makes sense.

176
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,990
Seeing them working so hard,

177
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,780
they're no different from
any other young pilots.

178
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:25,080
We could keep Colonel Zechs
from getting into any danger

179
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,300
by getting rid of them right
here and now, y’know, Lt. Noin.

180
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,800
You still don't understand him.

181
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:34,700
Zechs would never forgive us
for doing such a thing.

182
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,560
Has the shield also been
attached to the Gatling arm?

183
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,660
[TROWA:] Yeah, but it's heavy.

184
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,740
Sorry.

185
00:11:41,740 --> 00:11:44,311
Normally we wouldn't want
people going around

186
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,580
touching our mobile
suits, would we?

187
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,720
Then I guess you'd better hurry
up and figure out this guy.

188
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,280
Yeah.

189
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:53,520
But this time I’m gonna defeat
him no matter what it takes.

[STRAINED GRUNTS]

191
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:16,770
[BUTLER:] I contacted Mrs.
Noventa,

192
00:12:16,938 --> 00:12:18,700
and she forwarded this letter.

193
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:21,760
She told me she'd like you to
deliver the letter for her.

194
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:23,440
From Mrs. Noventa?

195
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,020
[BUTLER:] Yes, it's made
out to Heero Yuy.

196
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:26,980
To Heero?

197
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:37,770
[MRS. NOVENTA:] Your sudden
visit caught me off guard,

198
00:12:37,770 --> 00:12:40,390
and I felt that I was unable
to express to you

199
00:12:40,558 --> 00:12:42,200
the true feelings in my heart.

200
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:45,500
That's why I decided I
should write this letter.

201
00:12:46,060 --> 00:12:49,900
You made a mistake because
your plan went awry in battle.

202
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:54,020
You shouldn’t suffer any longer
than you already have.

My husband and Ventei died

for the near future,

where genuine young men like
yourselves could live happily.

That's what happens in war.

A wrong turn in the past
can be painful for everyone.

But you people are still young.

00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,280
I hope you'll think about
building a new future.

To my dear friend,
Mr. Heero Yuy.

[SYLVIA:]
So Heero's still alive.

I knew he'd make it
out of there somehow.

I'm leaving for
Sicily right away.

to find Heero!

Very good.

I'll make preparations
for your flight.

See? Heero was alive after all,
I just knew it!

[NOIN:] The South Pole.

A mobile suit battle
on a continent

228

that’s completely
covered in ice?

It's the only place to have

[MISER:] Colonel Zechs.

All areas needed to determine
ability have been restored.

to the extent that its
abilities can be measured.

I want this Gundam
completely restored.

235
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,260
Why should we take it that far?

00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,160
Because I wanna know more.

More about this mobile suit,

238

and more about the
pilot that was flying it.

239
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:45,280
But it’s impossible to restore
the right arm, sir.

240
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:48,940
[MISER:] It needs the power
to handle the giant beam cannon

241
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:51,380
and a system to precisely
control the beam saber.

242
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:54,740
We'd need the same time to
build a whole new mobile suit.

243
00:14:54,740 --> 00:14:55,820
[ZECHS:] In that case,

244
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:58,300
at least complete the beam
saber system for the 01

245

using parts from the left
arm of the Tallgeese.

[MISER:] Colonel Zechs, what
exactly are you trying to prove?

a problem, Lieutenant!

by a number of carriers, ma’am!

[NOIN:] They've found us.

255
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,341
[SOLDIER] We spotted them as
soon as...

256
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:28,380
we reached the continent.

257
00:15:28,780 --> 00:15:30,940
They've calculated
our flying range.

258
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:34,460
They must've figured out we'd be
headed for Colonel Zechs' base.

259
00:15:34,460 --> 00:15:36,980
Then we'll throw them off
by changing directions.

No go.

have enough fuel to lose them.

the base location we can attack.

You wouldn't dream
of doing anything

that would be a burden to Zechs.

So you're going on the Aries?

But I might consider it,

if you hand over the Gundam as
proof of Zechs' betrayal.

00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,510
Unfortunately for Zechs,

318
00:18:57,510 --> 00:19:00,100
that’s not going to
change his destiny.

319
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
We’re finishing him
off right here.

320
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,210
And as my reward
for defeating him,

321
00:19:04,210 --> 00:19:07,000
my superior skills will
finally be recognized.

322
00:19:07,040 --> 00:19:09,920
I’d never let you
scoundrels get near Zechs!

323
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:12,760
Aha! So Zechs is
here after all!!

324
00:19:12,760 --> 00:19:13,740
Damn you!

we wanted, get rid of them!

Emergency landing!

Let me off first.

330
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:40,640
I will correct the mistakes
brought on by your weakness.

[GUNFIRE AND EXPLOSIONS]

A Gundam! That's Gundam 03!

333
00:20:13,460 --> 00:20:17,040
No! That Gundam's strong!
It's too much!

334
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,100
The Gundam will be used as an
excuse to attack the colonies.

335
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,200
So I can't have anyone report
back that it was seen here.

“Those who have laid eyes on a
Gundam

shall not live to
tell about it.”

341

Those are the

That's enough! Stop!

There’s a Gundam down here!

Damn it.

00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,320
Why is it I have to keep
on fighting like this?

346
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,940
These young pilots.

347
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,440
They’re too pure.

Hey, are you all right?

The name is Trowa, Lieutenant.

I need a favor of you.

Reload the explosives
for Heero Yui.

Forget that.

Stop worrying about
that right now!

Heero and Zechs commence their
battle amidst the snowy winds.
