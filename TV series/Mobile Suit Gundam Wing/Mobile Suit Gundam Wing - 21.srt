00:01:26,102 --> 00:01:31,102
[NARRATOR] Treize Khushrenada
assumes the position as the
World Nation's sovereign

4
00:01:31,102 --> 00:01:37,048
and once again accumulates all
military armaments on land. In
space the White Fang

5
00:01:37,048 --> 00:01:42,248
completes its gigantic space
battleship Libra. With his
desire to eliminate Earth

6
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:46,770
commander Milliardo Peacecraft
proceeds with his plans
to enter into a

7
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,770
fully fledged war with the
entire forces of the World
Nation led by Treize.

8
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:57,870
The Gundam pilots continue to
fight, not siding with anyone.
And right before

9
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,170
them the largest battle yet to
be experienced by humanity
is about to begin.

10
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,430
Make it fast. We're
expecting our enemy.

11
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:09,570
Our enemy? Who do you mean?

12
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:14,570
The most annoying and fearful

The Gundams.

Go ahead Ms. Relena.

15
00:02:31,405 --> 00:02:36,005
[ZECHS] The Earth only seems
beautiful because we
have the chance

16
00:02:36,005 --> 00:02:37,510
to see it like this
from outer space.

17
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:41,450
Those on Earth can't possibly
appreciate its true beauty.

18
00:02:41,510 --> 00:02:45,450
Are you suggesting all of
humanity should come up
to outer space?

19
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:49,180
Those who don't want to come
here certainly don't have to.

20
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:53,910
[ZECHS] I won't simply ignore
powers on Earth that are a
threat to peace here in space.

21
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:58,850
Surely that's no reason to
become the largest threat to
peace yourself though.

22
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:03,510
The time has come for Earth and
space to discard all
their weapons.

23
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,510
No. This isn't the time for your
world of total pacifism.

24
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,250
Therefore outer space must
direct all its force against the
people on the Earth.

25
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,650
Using the battleship Libra.

26
00:03:14,650 --> 00:03:17,580
No! You're mistaken Milliardo.

27
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:20,180
How would you know?

28
00:03:20,180 --> 00:03:23,310
I know that because I am
Relena Peacecraft.

29
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,710
My dear Relena...

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

31
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:38,050
You've grown up strong Relena,
but your strength is no
longer needed.

32
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:41,780
I want you at least to
remain a kind woman.

33
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:46,510
In truth I don't even know
whether I'm being held in the
arms of Milliardo

34
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:50,110
the kind brother that
I once knew...

35
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:53,650
... or in the bloodstained hands
of Zechs Marquise.

36
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:58,710
If you want to return to the
Earth I'm not going to stop you.
If you want to stay in

37
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,650
space I'll find you a place to
live in a colony.

38
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:05,780
I'm staying right where I am.
Until you change your mind.

39
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:10,250
Do me a favor. Show Relena to
the officer's room Dorothy.

40
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,250
[DOROTHY] Right away.

41
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:18,110
Let's be on our way Ms. Relena.
It'd be wiser to continue
this discussion after

42
00:04:18,110 --> 00:04:21,450
you've had some rest.

43
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,110
Perhaps you're right. Show
me the way then.

44
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,650
Sure.

45
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:30,110
Do you consider me a weak man,
Quinze?

46
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:35,550
[QUINZE] On the contrary if you
hadn't been looking out
for someone I

47
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,110
wouldn't have welcomed you as
the White Fang leader.

48
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:42,980
Thanks for saying so.

49
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:53,110
Now then how shall we proceed?

50
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:56,180
Destroy Libra. That simple.

51
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,250
But will that end
the war though?

52
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:03,910
No it won't. On Earth Treize is
getting ready to send a
military force to space.

53
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:06,850
The colonies will
retaliate against that.

54
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:11,850
But we can't just leave Libra. I
agree that we should destroy it.

Sure thing Duo. But can
we destroy it?

Zechs as our enemy?

same way about us.

other units to me.

well. I'll leave the
front ones to you.

fighting this many separately.

The Gundams are struggling with
the enemy's tactics.

So the mobile dolls are
regarding the Gundams as
their main targets.

But we can't attack and
protect the Gundams.

got up your sleeve?

would use his mobile
dolls strategically.

the movements of the mobile
dolls this precisely?

94
00:08:36,450 --> 00:08:42,580
No not usually. I can only
imagine that Zechs must have
developed some new system.

go. That should be enough.

So tell me have you come up with
a good way to persuade Mr.
Milliardo.

101
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,650
I'm not persuading. I
must convince him.

102
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:26,710
It's impossible to convince him.

103
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:31,180
Because Mr. Milliardo is dead
serious about
destroying the Earth.

thinking of initiating
another war though.

00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:41,380
There will be another war. Just
as Mr. Treize predicted.

I'm not sure.
[DOROTHY] Use this!

00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:54,850
It's the only way you'll be able
to stop Mr. Milliardo. You can
do it Ms. Relena.

If it means preventing a war
from starting...

112

No I could never do
something like that.

113
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,910
Because you can't shoot your own
brother? Or because it's against
your ideal of pacifism?

114
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:12,050
It must be because you're Relena
Peacecraft and you're unable
to take action being

through assassination.

defeat them simply

Then why did you send
out the units?

129
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:04,310
I have started a war of
attrition against them. Even the
Gundams and their pilots

really close to Libra

come up with a plan.

more mobile dolls

They'll probably separate us
and then attack us.

enemy will attack when
you're most worn out.

00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,400
But what options do we have?

151
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:56,670
[HOWARD] No need to worry yet.
We have the people and
resources we need.

152
00:12:56,670 --> 00:12:59,670
And the Gundams are
almost repaired.

153
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:01,470
Yeah, sure. Almost.

154
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:06,130
That's right. We're not
machines. If they keep
challenging us to these battles

155
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:10,470
we're eventually gonna fold.
Both the pilots and
the mechanics.

156
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,730
[HEERO] Could you install this?

157
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:16,130
But this is... no way!

158
00:13:16,130 --> 00:13:18,730
Quatre can handle that.

159
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:24,200
I see. OK. I'll do it.

160
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,330
What do you think?

161
00:13:35,330 --> 00:13:39,800
It's not bad at all. I'd like to
try it in real combat.

162
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:44,930
Do that. I'm going to have my
hands full fighting Wing
Zero with Epyon.

163
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:50,400
Commander Milliardo!
Peacemillion is heading
straight for us!

164
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,130
I'll face them now.

165
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:10,470
I've asked Howard to install the
Zero System in this
suit as well.

166
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:12,530
But how come?

167
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:17,600
It's a good system for leading
troops into battle. Try it out.

168
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:24,400
I can't Heero! I can't do it! I
just can't. No! Not the Zero!

169
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:37,530
I can't do it! I don't have what
it takes! Heero why don't you
lead us with Wing Zero?

170
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,730
Wing Zero will be fighting
Epyon. But someone has to lay
out a plan if we're

171
00:14:42,730 --> 00:14:45,200
going to survive this.

172
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,200
[QUATRE] I know that.

173
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:51,800
Then you've gotta take command.
This is the way you can pay
back the people

174
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:55,270
[HEERO] ... in outer space. OK?
Heero...

175
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,070
The code's Zero. You have to
input the letters to
activate the Zero System.

176
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:06,130
Mobile dolls from Libra are
coming this way. You'd all
better head out.

177
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:10,200
But I... how will I?

178
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:17,130
Heero!

179
00:15:17,130 --> 00:15:21,270
Epyon's coming. The
rest is up to you.

180
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:24,600
[DUO] We'll take good
care of 'em.

181
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:29,870
Hang on. From a strategic point
of view Heero has to
go fight Epyon.

182
00:15:29,870 --> 00:15:33,130
But we need a strategic plan of
our own. [WU FEI] They're here!

183
00:15:35,130 --> 00:15:38,130
Hey Wu Fei! Trowa!

184
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:43,400
[SOLDIER] The mobile doll troops
have encountered the enemy.

185
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:49,400
So this is how the mobile doll
command system taken from
Epyon operates.

186
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:57,470
Mr. Milliardo is a true genius.
This way even the soulless
mobile dolls are able to

187
00:15:57,470 --> 00:16:03,470
fight with the mind of a human
being. Now my dear mobile
dolls let's see

188
00:16:03,470 --> 00:16:06,470
a spectacular dance.

[ZECHS] Let's get started.

193
00:16:24,330 --> 00:16:26,530
I'm here.

194
00:16:34,003 --> 00:16:39,400
[HEERO] I wanna know what you're
up to. Why are you
starting these battles?

195
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,500
[ZECHS] To end all battles.

Wu Fei! Move back here for now!

199
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:54,200
[DUO] Why should he? I'll go
and support him!

200
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:54,930
Duo!

201
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,930
[DUO] What?

[GUNFIRE]

204
00:17:11,870 --> 00:17:16,600
We're not getting anywhere.
We've gotta get in some
kind of formation.

205
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:19,330
[DOROTHY] Now let's
change our plan.

206
00:17:19,330 --> 00:17:24,930
We'll isolate each one of the
Gundams and destroy
them separately.

207
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:28,670
[ZECHS] I see you've
mastered the system.

208
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,600
And so have you!

00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,330
[DUO] Miss Noin!

212
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:50,400
It's exactly the same. It's just
like the attack on the
Sanc Kingdom.

213
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,200
[QUATRE] This isn't working.
We're gonna get totaled.

214
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:19,346
[QUATRE] Wu Fei fly right
through the enemy troops.

215
00:18:19,346 --> 00:18:21,876
The rest of us will direct fire
to where Wu Fei was.

[WU FEI YELLS]

218
00:18:27,965 --> 00:18:32,425
What's this? They've come up
with a strategy!

219
00:18:32,425 --> 00:18:37,625
The enemy's divided into a
number of units. Now's our
chance to defeat those

220
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:42,765
units one at a time. Trowa
attack the troops on the
upper right side.

221
00:18:42,765 --> 00:18:46,365
Then destroy the front unit
Duo and Wu Fei.

222
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:48,365
[TROWA] Roger. [DUO] Gotcha.

223
00:18:48,365 --> 00:18:50,765
[WU FEI] There's a good plan!

224
00:18:51,695 --> 00:18:54,365
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

225
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:13,365
I can't let the
system control me.

226
00:19:13,365 --> 00:19:17,295
There's no choice now but to
master the system.

227
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:21,295
[DOROTHY] I don't understand.
The Gundams are predicting
each of my moves!

228
00:19:21,295 --> 00:19:23,295
How come? What's happening?

229
00:19:26,765 --> 00:19:31,625
The movements of these mobile
dolls aren't just programmed.

230
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:36,695
Some one's changing their
tactics based on the actual
battle. Gotta predict them.

231
00:19:36,695 --> 00:19:40,625
[DOROTHY] Who's doing this?
Who could it be?

Some one's controlling
these mobile dolls.

[QUATRE] Dorothy Catalonia.

Use Libra's main cannon
and strike them!

gotta be kidding!

try and shoot down Peacemillion.

Move the ship!

242

move that quickly.

[SALLY] Increase the output of
engines 1 to 8 to their maximum!

246
00:20:36,495 --> 00:20:40,225
But then we'd overload the
engines and they would explode!

00:20:40,225 --> 00:20:42,565
That's better than
being shot down!
