[OPENING THEME]

2
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:32,380
To facilitate it's reign over
the world, Romefeller Foundation
promoted a new OZ.

3
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:37,200
With it's main power consisting
of unmanned units
called mobile dolls.

4
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:42,560
Certain changes within the
Foundation followed Treize
Khushenrada's retaliation,

5
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:45,420
including his being
stripped of all power.

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:50,760
At the same time, the Foundation
was rapidly expanding
its area of rule,

7
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,680
thanks to the highly
skilled mobile dolls.

8
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,960
After the space colonies
accepted the Foundation,

9
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:01,680
execution orders were released
for the now isolated
Gundam pilots.

10
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:05,800
For them, it looked like the
future would take a turn
for the worse.

11
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:08,400
The Sanc Kingdom...

12
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,280
This is nuts, but
it's the only way

13
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,760
I knew it would be!

14
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,060
How very kind of you, but just
call me Dorothy Miss Relena.

15
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,740
And you are welcome to call me
Relena
‐ I couldn't!

16
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:41,240
You're the heroine of our times
Miss Relena! I myself feel a
great admiration for you.

<i>[SOLDIER:] First unit, proceed.</i>
<i>Second unit, standby for orders.</i>

19
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,600
<i>[SOLDIER 2:] No signs of</i>
<i>movement, the field has</i>
<i>been secured.</i>

[EXPLOSION]

22
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:13,400
We're surrounded! Hurry!

23
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:21,800
Is it Red‐One?

24
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:27,800
<i>[QUATRE:] This is absurd Heero!</i>
<i>It's totally absurd!</i>

25
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,040
[QUATRE:] It's a dispute within
their organization.

26
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:33,980
Participating in their fight
only makes you another target!

27
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:36,220
[HEERO:] A target?
That's fine with me.

28
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:39,220
Execution orders have been
issued for us Gundam pilots,

29
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,220
this way I can let Romefeller
know that I'm still alive.

30
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,760
It's my way of retaliating.

31
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,140
[SOLDIER:] After the enemy!
We'll show them what stray
dogs are made of.

32
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,320
<i>[QUATRE:] Is this</i>
<i>really okay Heero?</i>

<i>wild about him...</i>

35
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:26,860
<i>Nice to meet you, Heero Yuy, and</i>
<i>Quatre Roberba Winner.</i>

36
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:32,600
<i>[DOROTHY:] Welcome to Earth.</i>
<i>Welcome to a warrior's paradise.</i>

37
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:44,840
What did you say!?

38
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,680
[OLD MAN:] No‐ no oh no!

39
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,460
[SOLDIER:] Repeat what
you just said!

40
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:53,660
You're mistaken! I
haven't said anything!

41
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:58,440
Liar! You think that the two OZ
factions should just
crush each other!

42
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,060
Listen fellas, I just want
to live in peace!

43
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:03,360
Quiet you!

44
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,920
[SOLDIER:] The Treize Faction is
ready to attack this area,

45
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:12,080
all physically fit men are to
join our backup forces!

46
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,760
Get your boss out here and
round up the people!

47
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,100
[OZ GENERAL:] Total pacifism?

48
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,940
That's right! We refuse
to participate in

49
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,740
military operations in order
to attain peace.

50
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:28,740
The Treize Faction here are
former OZ members that defended
your land in the past.

51
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:31,560
But now... They're
resisting us as rebels.

52
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:36,560
That dispute concerns the OZ
organization. It has
nothing to do with us!

53
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:39,220
A very convenient
notion of pacifism.

54
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:43,220
Once the occupying army becomes
a nuisance, you suddenly declare
yourselves pacifists.

55
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,360
The duty of the military is to
protect the citizens.

56
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:48,360
But now the troops are unwanted.

57
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,760
I'm beginning to feel a little
bit sorry for the
Treize Faction.

58
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:55,460
In either case, the
battle will commence.

59
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,520
We should continue our
discussion after
peace is attained.

60
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:02,140
It's absurd to even speak of
pacifism in the flames of war.

61
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:13,060
Are you alright? I'm sorry I
couldn't come to help you.

62
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,080
Ah, thank you lad.

63
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,880
It happens all the time.

64
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,900
Fighting back against them would
only make things a lot
worse for me.

65
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,540
[MAN:] Are you a traveler?
‐[QUATRE:] Yes.

66
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:29,680
[MAN:] You couldn't have come
at a worse possible time.

67
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:33,260
This would be a beautiful place
if it weren't for
this situation.

68
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,620
They're starting to move in.
They're close this time.

69
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,400
I'll go check it out!

70
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,780
OZ's Aries suits...

71
00:06:55,940 --> 00:07:00,160
Lure the enemies over this way.
Don't forget to
disperse the debris!

72
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:12,800
That's right, do everything to
defeat them!
‐ [SOLDIER:] Yes sir!

73
00:07:12,980 --> 00:07:16,440
Shouldn't we be advising the
civilians to evacuate now?

74
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,880
Don't underestimate
our abilities!

75
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,460
We'll defeat the Treize Faction
rebels well before they come
close to the town!

76
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:38,400
[GENERAL:] Let's go
over our plans:

77
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:42,640
We'll trick the enemy's advance
guard by having our main
troops attack first.

78
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:45,500
Meanwhile, our mobile forces
will come in from the side,

79
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,860
enter the town, and attack
enemy headquarters.

80
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:52,800
The mobile forces will join our
main troops, expel the enemy
troops, and take over the town.

81
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,500
The leader of the mobile forces
will be... Red‐One.

82
00:07:56,660 --> 00:07:59,060
You're in charge. Can
you handle it?

83
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,140
Of course I can. I am a Gundam
pilot, after all.

84
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,900
[OZ GENERAL:] What!? New forces?

85
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,920
Sir! Their abilities outweigh
the strength of our forces!

86
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:27,200
Send troops from our front line.
Wipe them out now!

87
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:38,460
Good, their firepower is
decreased. Smash through them!!

destroying us.

failed, too many casualties.

112
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,940
We'll retreat for now.

[RELENA:] There is no need for
armaments in pacifism.

117
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:21,600
But unless the whole world
starts thinking in these terms,

118
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:25,060
I'm positive that the Sanc
Kingdom will never be a
safe country.

119
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,200
[RELENA:] Under these
circumstances, I'm
delighted to have

120
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,400
the opportunity to attend
classes with you.

121
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:33,220
You who are poised to take on
the responsibilities

122
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:34,720
of your respective nations.

123
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,600
I really hope that together we
can think of a way

124
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,080
to eliminate wars from this
world in the near future.

125
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,360
Quite admirable.

126
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:45,960
[RELENA:] Any comments Dorothy?

127
00:11:46,540 --> 00:11:48,120
I think it's wonderful.

128
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,120
If everyone in this world
were Miss Relena,

129
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:54,020
wars would be immediately
denounced as foolish.

130
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:57,100
And would disappear from
this world forever.

131
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:59,880
But if everybody were
Miss Relena,

132
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,800
nobody would realize just how
wonderful you are!

133
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,180
Dorothy. I'm aware that my views
may appear to be a little
naive to some people,

134
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:12,940
but I wonder why people battle
if everyone agrees that it's
foolish to do so.

135
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:16,100
I don't think that we're too
far from the answer.

136
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:21,420
Miss Relena, I think I
understand why there is never
an end to battles.

137
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,200
Huh? What do you mean by that?

138
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,740
People love to fight each other.

139
00:12:25,940 --> 00:12:28,800
And fighting satisfies
their instincts, you know.

140
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,860
But many lives are lost
as a result of fighting.

141
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:35,580
Miss Relena, I'm not
interested in results.

142
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,300
You can leave things alone and
still get results.

143
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:40,580
Beauty lies in taking action.

144
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,440
The action of fighting is the
most fascinating human aspect!

145
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:48,660
Throughout history, people have
fought each other over
and over again,

146
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:52,040
As if battles are the purpose
of human existence.

147
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:58,240
That's why I started thinking in
this way. It's not true that
we shouldn't fight.

148
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:00,780
As humans, I think
we must fight.

149
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:03,700
I'm afraid I don't
share your opinion.

150
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:06,550
I'm positive that we're
capable of not repeating

151
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:08,960
the tragedies of the past in
the times ahead.

152
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:12,140
Your wise opinions are also
necessary in a war.

153
00:13:12,140 --> 00:13:14,340
History changes radically
when the lives of

154
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,700
people with similar opinions
are sought after.

155
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:23,060
Miss Relena, I truly believe the
Sanc Kingdom is going to be the
center stage of these times.

156
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,560
[MUTTERING]

157
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:31,520
Watch me Dorothy. As long as I
live I will continue to
promote total pacifism.

158
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:36,240
Even if I end up getting killed,
I'm sure these policies
will bear fruit.

159
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,760
That's good to hear Miss Relena.
You mustn't fear death.

160
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,800
Because death is merely an end
result given to you
at your birth.

161
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:56,720
But don't be worried
Miss Relena.

162
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:01,540
Brave knights are about to
arrive before you who will be
very helpful for your future.

163
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:05,180
They will be able to
protect you.

164
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:16,020
So one of the enemies is
a Gundam pilot.

165
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:19,000
[SOLDIER:] I suspect he'll cause
a great deal of
damage to the area.

166
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:22,480
The mayor stressed total
pacifism right up til
the very end.

167
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:25,240
We'd have to destroy this
nation anyway.

168
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,940
Position yourselves for battle!
‐[SOLDIER:] Sir!

169
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,060
[QUATRE:] Mister!

170
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,280
Oh, so you made it out okay,
I was getting worried about you!

171
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,000
What's this?
‐ A war's going to break out.

172
00:14:36,520 --> 00:14:39,240
I'm getting ready to move out
for a long spell.

173
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:54,680
What the!? New mobile dolls?

174
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:59,140
Look at them, all lined up.
Those guys just love to fight.

175
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:02,360
But we think that total
peace suits us just fine.

176
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:08,520
Our country took a courageous
position. We decided to follow
the Sanc Kingdom.

177
00:15:08,740 --> 00:15:10,360
The Sanc Kingdom?

178
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:22,980
[PAGAN:] Miss Relena!
Are you alright?

179
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,400
What do you mean Pagan?

180
00:15:26,460 --> 00:15:28,140
I mean that recently,

181
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:30,980
there's been a great increase in
the number of nations

182
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:33,740
relying on the total pacifism
of the Sanc Kingdom.

183
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,860
And all of these nations are
relying on the Sanc Kingdom
for leadership.

184
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,080
There's a lot of pressure to
meet these responsibilities.

185
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:46,160
Even you could get very
exhausted by all this pressure,
Miss Relena.

186
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:50,420
Thanks for caring Pagan, but
this is what I am
living for now.

187
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,400
I have to do my best, or being
leader of the Sanc Kingdom
would be in vain.

188
00:15:55,860 --> 00:15:59,680
But there's also a certain
classmate of yours that
has me worried.

189
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:03,720
You can't let down your guard
with her around. ‐You
mean Dorothy?

190
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,860
Pagan please, you mustn't
speak badly of her.

191
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,720
I wonder what sort of education
she had at Romefeller...

192
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,180
Dorothy is a very
intelligent friend.

193
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,800
I'm sure she's thinking about
these war times even more
seriously than I am.

194
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:21,200
I'm sure that one day she'll
come to understand our views.

195
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:27,020
Miss Noin instructed me to keep
this a secret from you but...

196
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:28,540
Keep what a secret?

197
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:34,300
I'll tell you, since I believe
you'd do better to have as many
allies as possible right now.

198
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,800
Well, what is it? Pagan?

199
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:41,640
We've been able to locate the
Gundam pilot Heero Yuy.

200
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,160
Heero Yuy!?

201
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:46,100
[PAGAN:] Miss Noin is on her way
to meet with him as we speak.

202
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:49,300
He's here? So Heero has
returned to Earth?

203
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:52,300
He seems to be very
exhausted as well.

204
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:56,480
Miss Noin says she's planning to
bring him here to the
Sanc Kingdom.

205
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,440
Then he's really... come back.

206
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:02,720
[GUNFIRE]

207
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:20,420
The new models. It'll be
tough with this Leo.

208
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:22,060
[GUNFIRE]

209
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,780
<i>[OZ SOLDIER:] The enemies are</i>
<i>battling at the defense line.</i>

210

<i>[OZ SOLDIER 2:] Hasn't</i>
<i>headquarters been evacuated yet?</i>
<i>Hurry!</i>

211
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:10,700
Only the soldiers seem to be
panicked. Everyone
else is relaxed.

212
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:14,020
We're just tired of having
anything to do with war.

213
00:18:14,020 --> 00:18:16,260
You're tired of it.
‐Everybody is!

214
00:18:16,620 --> 00:18:19,740
It is possible to avoid fighting
and live in peace!

215
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:22,660
We've just chosen to do
what seemed natural!

216
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:28,380
These days many people and
indeed countries are beginning
to demand total pacifism.

217
00:18:28,520 --> 00:18:31,060
Although their strength is
still insignificant,

218
00:18:31,060 --> 00:18:33,240
once the number of people
who seek peace

219
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,940
outweighs that of the soldiers,
I'm certain the world is
bound to change.

220
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:42,820
I heard that the Romefeller
Foundation thinks of the Sanc
Kingdom as a problem.

221
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:46,080
Because many countries have
started supporting them.

222
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,820
Eventually Romefeller will be
left without any supporters.

223
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:52,330
<i>[QUATRE:] So the Romefeller</i>
<i>Foundation considers the</i>

224
00:18:52,330 --> 00:18:55,140
<i>Sanc Kingdom a threat because</i>
<i>they're afraid of them!</i>

225
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:59,940
<i>That opens up a chance for total</i>
<i>pacifism to be</i>
<i>realized worldwide!</i>

226
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,960
What's wrong young lad?

227
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,000
[QUATRE:] Thanks for
everything Mister!

228
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,780
I'm going to go there, to
the Sanc Kingdom.

229
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:10,300
[SOLDIER YELLING]

230
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,780
I'll fight through this... It's
my way of retaliating.

231
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,160
I'm fighting through this
longer than anyone.

232
00:19:37,540 --> 00:19:40,300

<i>alright? Heero, we</i>
<i>can't die yet!</i>

236
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,700
Listen to me! We have to
protect the Sanc Kingdom.

237
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,820
What, the Sanc Kingdom? Who, us?

238
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:35,880
That's right! That's the job we
must do here on Earth!

239
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,040
What the‐

240
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:45,640
Hey that's... the beam gatling
from your Gundam!

241
00:20:49,060 --> 00:20:52,200
You're Gundam pilots so I'm sure
you know how to use that.

242
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:54,180
I'll back you up while you
get out of there.

243
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:43,660
Heero!

244
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,720
[NOIN:] So you told
Relena about it?

245
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,920
I'm terribly sorry.

246
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:55,100
I realize that this will
increase the odds of her finding
out about the Gundams.

247
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:59,060
We'll handle it if it comes up.
Pagan, don't worry.

248
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:05,440
I'm sure that smile of hers will
obliterate the suffering we're
about to experience.
