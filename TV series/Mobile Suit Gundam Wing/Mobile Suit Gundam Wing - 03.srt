[ZECHS] Certain conditions must

[ZECHS] First all weapons must
be eliminated. And second

the desire to fight must be
erased from people's mind.

[NOIN] Zechs considers this

because he wishes to die

11
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:32,550

intends to pay for the sin of
purging humanity all by himself.

I'm sure Heero's figured that

15
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:03,120
[SOLDIER] 80% of our soldiers
have returned safely but there's
substantial damage to

16
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,000
our mobile suit force. It
appears that 67% of them
have been destroyed.

Then destroy our remaining
mobile suits as soon as
they are retrieved.

18
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:17,400
[SOLDIER] What?! It's important
that we rid ourselves

19
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:21,800
of all weapons left on the
Earth. Those are his
excellency's orders.

20
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,700
I understand now. So Treize
Khushrenada's objective was
total pacifism as well huh?

rowdy! We need to concentrate.

29
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,800
Tell that to the enemy will ya?

30
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:19,900
I am like a body that has lost
its soul. Now's your chance
to take revenge

31
00:04:19,900 --> 00:04:23,870
for your father's death.

32

Let's put an end to all this.
The revenge and the battles.

Yes.

00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,500
Now what can we do about Libra
and Peacemillion?

35
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:50,320
We have already estimated the
location of the
impact and issued

36
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,400
an evacuation warning.

37
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,200
Evacuation? You're not serious.

38
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,700
If those two battleships hit
ground the entire world
will be effected.

39
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:05,500
[HOWARD] If those battleships
enter the Earth's atmosphere &amp;
explode on ground

40
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:10,800
the initial explosion might be
limited to a radius of a few
hundred kilometers.

41
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,000
But the enormous amount of dust
spreading across the skies
would block solar rays,

42
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,700
resulting in a dramatic decrease
in temperatures
around the world.

43
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:22,170
[RELENA] That's terrible.

44
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:25,970
[SALLY] And people won't be able
to live on the Earth any longer.

45
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:29,860
The only way to avoid this is to
change their orbit or blow
them up in space.

46
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,570
Both are next to impossible.
[LADY UN] No we still have hope.

47
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:37,350
There's a Gundam close to
Peacemillion's power supply.

48

[RELENA] Is it Heero? [LADY UN]
No I think it's 02.

them. Well then we
still have hope.

moving about to know for sure.

to either Earth or the

just the same because in reality
it's a battle to save the

Wait a second isn't that where
my brother and Heero are?

They're not going to quit until
it's all over. [RELENA] No

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

146

The colonies have started
heading toward total pacifism
all on their own.

147
00:14:15,350 --> 00:14:18,730
What you're doing is
meaningless.

148

My destiny is smeared with blood
and I won't be talked out of
this transgression.

149
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,680
[ZECHS] I'm gonna
settle this Heero!

[QUATRE] Heero!

What Quatre?

153
00:14:53,060 --> 00:14:57,800
Good you're OK. The block is
still descending quickly
toward the Earth.

154
00:14:57,820 --> 00:15:02,660
Gotcha. I'm gonna destroy this
ship's power system.

We'll smash it to smithereens

One should never give up till
the end. That's what
Heavyarms has taught me.

Chance of success is almost nil.
But this is better than

158
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,500
sitting back and not
doing anything.

[SOLDIER] Are you OK
Master Quatre?

here? It's too dangerous!

‐Let us help you out master.

[HEERO] Farewell Relena...

168
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:28,460
There's only one more thing
required to attain total peace:

169
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:33,640
A strong heart that can
empathize with people.
Like yours.

170
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:41,400
[ZECHS] You're too pure &amp; too
kind, but I guess that's what
gives you the right to live.

171
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:47,550
Just watch me I'm gonna live
right to the bitter end!

172
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,930
[HEERO] Zechs!

173

[ZECHS] I'll live the hard
life of a warrior!

of the block is still

176
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:07,020
falling it's not disintegrating!

177

It's going to hit Earth for
sure. Tell the

through this.

enough already! [SOLDIER 3]

Buster Rifle. [CHEERS]

Master Quatre did you hear that?

187
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,000
Sure did. We'd better get out of
here because we don't wanna
get in Heero's way.

flying ahead of it.

[RELENA] Heero?

194
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:25,460
[HOWARD] He's not gonna make it.
[SALLY] No He'll make it. I
think he'll be OK.

195

But he's gotta get through the
Earth's high temperatures!

From what I have seen the
Gundams can overcome
any difficulties.

197
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:38,000
That's true. I know we can
believe in him.

198
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:43,750
Because Heero's the kind of
person who can give
everybody hope.
