[NARRATOR] By having Relena
Peacecraft join the

00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,060
Romefeller Foundation as
their representative

5
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,080
and a symbol of peace they're

6
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,080
able to gain the
support of the people

7
00:01:36,080 --> 00:01:39,260
and are justified in making the
World Nation a reality.

8
00:01:39,260 --> 00:01:43,980
Meanwhile in space, armed
citizens who oppose Oz's

00:01:43,980 --> 00:01:47,100
colonial rule rise in
every colony

10
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,640
and start a movement
for independence

11
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,000
under the name White Fang.

12
00:01:52,540 --> 00:01:56,080
The year is After Colony 195.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:59,860
Wars are intensifying and
are hurling the era

14
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:02,600
toward drastic changes.

15
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,680
I wish to make an announcement
to the entire world.

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:15,440
[RELENA] As of this day I,
Relena Peacecraft,
have taken on the

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,560
duties as chief representative
of the Romefeller Foundation.

18
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,280
However I am not doing this for
the sake of the
Romefeller Foundation.

19
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:27,240
I think of this as the first
step along a very positive road.

20
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,120
And upon this road we can
all walk together.

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,580
We can eliminate wars and create
peace. At this time

22
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,160
I ask that you all discard your
weapons and stop fighting.

23
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,900
Because I am sure that we are
all hoping for the same future.

24
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:48,220
So together let us all advance
toward these objectives.

25
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:52,300
I am announcing the elimination
of all national borders.

26
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:57,320
These borders have been the
cause of wars around the world.

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:02,300
I declare there is one nation:
The World Nation.

of retiring once the World

[MAN 2] That's not even funny.

queen's top army corps.

Haha so our next battleground's
already waiting for us, huh?

Don't you have to go with
the rest of them?

41
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:15,520
For me this war is over.

42
00:04:16,340 --> 00:04:20,060
My own country's destroyed so
I've got nothing to protect.

43
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,300
Once again I've lost any
reason I had to fight.

44
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:28,520
[WAITER] I see your point. I
just hope this all
leads to peace.

45
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:31,060
Leads to peace?

[ZECHS] Is this how it
really should be?

00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:37,440
No. Peace shouldn't
come this easily.

Then you're

Allow me to introduce myself.

53

My name is Quinze and I'm with
the White Fang revolutionaries

who are fighting to free the
people of the
colonies as we speak.

Let me guess...

56
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,620
you're not satisfied with just
the colonies so you

57
00:05:05,620 --> 00:05:08,400
want to start a
revolution on Earth.

58
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,380
Haha. That's pretty amusing.

[QUINZE] They don't call you
Lightning Count for nothing.

I'm sorry fella, but I've got
nothing to say to you.

00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:18,240
So leave me alone.

62

It comes to me as no
great surprise that

63
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:23,720
you have problems
trusting our group.

64
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:29,320
All we did was take up the
beliefs of our former
leader Heero Yuy.

65
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,340
It's my understanding that at
one point you were
sympathetic to

66
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,560
the independence of the colonies

67
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,260
when you came as Peacecraft of
the Sanc kingdom.

68
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:41,760
Just what is it you're trying
to get me to do now?

69
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,200
We want you to come back
to outer space.

And bring your Gundam
with you as well.

Bring my Gundam?

72
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:55,520
[QUINZE] Yes. The Gundam is a
symbol of rebellion

73
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:01,400
so we need both you...
and your Gundam.

Relena's declaration of
the word nation

76
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:20,600
the world is well on its way
to ridding itself of

truly wonderful thing.

responsibilities have
not ended here.

Evil rebels in outer space have
forgotten the protection we

80

have given them and are
inclined to revolt.

with these rebels

[DERMAIL] What is it,

I'm wondering what gives you
this authority
within Romefeller?

I fail to understand what you
mean by that question.

Isn't our new representative and
leader Queen Relena

sitting right over there
behind you Duke Dermail?

Huh?

90
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,040
Listen for a moment. I find it
extremely disrespectful

91
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:08,120
for you to stand there like that

92
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:11,180
and tell us what our
plans should be.

93
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:14,900
I don't believe I'm alone in
thinking that you should

94
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,640
voluntarily retire from the
Romefeller Foundation
much as Treize

95
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:19,800
Khushrenada did.

96
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,320
But I assure you we have no
intention of forcing you

97
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,380
like you forced him.

98
00:07:25,420 --> 00:07:28,400
I propose that we take the
democratic route and vote

99
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,120
on the issue.

00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,620
Your arguments are valid. But in
order not to repeat

102
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:38,480
the historic mistake that
particular dictator made

103
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:42,260
I have no intention of stepping
down from my position.

104
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,660
Of course I'd be prepared to
do so at any time

105
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,740
should it become necessary.

106
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,760
I understand. You're saying that
now is not the time.

107
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,440
That's correct. Does that
satisfy you, Marquis Weridge?

108
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,100
Yes that's fine. [GRUNT]

[RELENA] My only hope is that
this leads to world peace.

110
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:16,300
Gentlemen I believe Duke Dermail
brought Queen Relena to
the forefront

111
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:19,640
in order to hold on to
his own position.

112
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:23,980
But that move in fact makes his
position more unstable.

113
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,400
At the present time more than
half of the Romefeller

114
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,340

Queen Relena.

115
00:08:30,340 --> 00:08:34,360
Hmmm. We'll make Queen Relena
the World Nation's

116
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,780
sovereign both in
name and reality.

117
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:40,980
Are you certain we're doing the
right thing Miss Dorothy?

118
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:46,380
Hmm? Yes. Because our era
must be guided in the

119
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:48,520
correct direction.

120
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,140
Is that right? Wu Fei
has declined?

121
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,280
He's got his own
priorities it seems.

to do anything.

come on board.

With no memory of the past I
don't think I'll be of any help.

But I must say I am feeling
pretty comfortable just

being here with you

Come on. Your time is up.

as our group symbol.

be our enemy.
