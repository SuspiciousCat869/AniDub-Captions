00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:27,240
[Narrator:] With high
expectations human
beings leave earth

3
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:29,530
...to begin a new life in
space colonies.

4
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:32,550
However, the United Earth
Sphere Alliance

5
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:34,500
gains great military powers...

6
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,920
...and soon seizes control over
one colony after another...

7
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:40,580
..in the name of
justice and peace.

8
00:01:41,510 --> 00:01:44,510
The year is After Colony 195.

00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,030
Operation Meteor.

10
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:48,920
In a move to counter the
Alliance's tyranny,

11
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,200
rebel citizens of
certain colonies...

12
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,600
...scheme to bring new
arsenals to the Earth...

13
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:56,340
...disguising them as
shooting stars.

14
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:59,090
However, the Alliance
headquarters

15
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:01,520
catches on to this operation.

16
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,680
Just as I thought.

17
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,850
Others are attacking OZ
facilities besides just me.

18
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:10,770
Wish I could meet them,

19
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:12,500
all of them.

20
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,500
I'm not involved.

[Narrator:] Scenario
for Bloodshed

22
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,690
This is New Edwards Base
reporting that the
shuttle has arrived.

23
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:36,130
Including ground vehicles, we
now have considerable numbers.

24
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,650
I see.

25
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,140
Thank you.

26
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,140
I have increased the frequency
of our notice that
all the top...

27
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:47,650
...officers of Oz will be
gathering at the new
Edwards Base.

28
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,440
Well at least the part about you
and I being there is
going to be true.

29
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,860
Are you counting yourself
in as a decoy?

30
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,860
Positioning is 100% complete.

31
00:02:56,860 --> 00:02:58,860
We shouldn't need to
increase it any further.

32
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:01,290
So Zechs is in Nairobi.

33
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:04,450
Don’t you think we should use
him for something
more significant?

34
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:07,690
We do not have as many OZ
stationed in Nairobi.

35
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:09,660
We're expecting a
fierce battle there.

36
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,940
I see.

37
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:19,540
Now people will cast off their
doubts and devote themselves to
a changing history.

38
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,930
Mission accepted.

39
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:26,740
New Edwards, OZ leaders
will assemble there.

40
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:33,220
I can’t believe it.
Trowa's gone again?!

41
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:36,240
Yes, but he did say that he'd be
coming back though.

42
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,780
That lousy punk keeps
wandering off on his own!

43
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:42,100
Normally I wouldn't even
hesitate to fire someone
like that guy.

44
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:45,100
But he's too good to get
rid of isn't he?

45
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:46,510
Blast him!

46
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,730
I'll make him earn his pay
when he get's back.

47
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,050
Trowa, how come you keep on
disappearing on us like this?

48
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,670
I can't believe Quatre suddenly
took off to a resort on his own.

49
00:04:06,700 --> 00:04:08,440
He's still a kid after all.

50
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,920
He must have gotten tired of
hanging around with old farts
like ourselves, huh?

51
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,620
[LAUGHTER]

52
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,290
Don’t you see that Master
Quatre's left us behind...

53
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:19,960
...so we could head out alone on
some type of mission?

54
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,080
What?! Are you serious, Captain?

55
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:25,820
He was concerned about our
safety, so he left us behind.

56
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:28,980
But it’s far more dangerous for
him if we’re not there
to protect him!

57
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:32,910
I couldn't refuse his kind
consideration for our safety,
but...

58
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:37,800
But Master Quatre, I only wish
you'd come to me for
some advice.

59
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:46,200
Is this the San Francisco
Starley Hotel?

60
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,260
I'd like to reserve a
room please.

61
00:04:48,260 --> 00:04:50,930
I'm on my own; that’s not a
problem, right?

62
00:04:58,910 --> 00:05:00,000
Looks like Trowa?!

63
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,620
Hi! So we meet again!

64
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:13,120
Funny we ended up at the
same destination.

65
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:15,050
I'm doing this alone.

66
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,660
So am I.

67
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,660
But what if we
helped each other?

68
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:19,900
Don’t think so.

69
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:22,380
Two's always better than one!

74
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:53,700
That suit...

75
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,230
Hey, you load your’s on too,
pal.

76
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,180
I'll come and take
over the cockpit.

77
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:05,040
Duo!

78
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:08,580
This time I’m definitely not
going to let the mission fail!

79
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,580
How about trusting me a bit?

80
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:11,840
Do what you want.

81
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,840
What do you know.

82
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:16,370
Looks like he remembered my
name after all.

83
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,050
Oh, man, this is gonna be quite
the battle isn't it.

84
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:35,620
This mission’s really big; I
don’t think you get it.

85
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,100
You bet I do.

86
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:40,560
This is our chance to finally
destroy the OZ organization.

87
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,280
This time is different.

88
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,090
We're gonna eliminate
every OZ leader.

89
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:48,300
Yeah. Then I go back to space.

[Narrator:] That day at the
New Edwards Base,

91
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,730
leaders of the United Earth
Sphere Alliance gather for
a conference...

92
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:15,170
...including the likes of Field
Marshal Noventa as
Chief Commander,

93
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:19,560
...General Septem, leader of the
Alliance's Space Force...

94
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:24,620
...and General Ventei, leader of
the Alliance's
Terrestrial Forces.

95
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,220
However, Treize arranges to
secretly disseminate false
information worldwide...

96
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:35,200
...stating that this meeting is
in fact a general meeting of
top OZ officials,

97
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,800
rather than Alliance leaders.

98
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,100
Let's see which course the
future will take.

99
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:46,000
It'll take whatever
direction you decide on.

100
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:50,830
It's up to the Alliance whether
or not my plans to
reform succeed.

101
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:52,830
That'll decide the future.

102
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,940
Lieutenant Zechs there’s an
inquiry from the Nairobi Base
regarding our formation.

103
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,490
Say we're practicing maneuvers
and we’re conducting a
simulation...

104
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,490
...air battle above the
Mombasa area.

105
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,450
Yes, sir!

106
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:08,540
Listen...

107
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:12,010
This battle might leave you
feeling disturbed later on,
Noin.

108
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,610
I do trust you, Zechs.

109
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:18,410
And if I know that this is an
important attack, then
I will fight.

110
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,020
The Alliance and OZ...

111
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,760
It's not as if the world will
change if one
replaces the other.

112
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,760
So why should we even fight?

113
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:33,000
OS: The initial purpose of the
Alliance was to deter the
military powers...

114
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,890
...of nations around the world.

115
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:39,240
But now we have become such a
military power ourselves.

116
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:44,170
I’ll say this: Expansion of
armaments and
development of weapons..

117
00:08:44,170 --> 00:08:46,000
...wastes money and labor.

118
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,570
I don’t believe the Alliance
shouldn't be heading in
that direction.

119
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:52,660
You are saying
reduce the forces?

120
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,080
That would only be the start.

121
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,490
Our ultimate goal is for
unilateral demilitarization.

122
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,620
[INDISTINCT CHATTER]

123
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,580
I'd agree to that.

124
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,970
General Ventei?!

125
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:07,740
We've all shed blood at one
point or another.

126
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:12,290
We had no other choices to make
an ideal alliance a reality.

127
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:16,300
However, for some reason our
objectives have ended
up changing.

128
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,440
The time's come for us to end
this period of bloodshed.

129
00:09:19,660 --> 00:09:22,330
If only we could stop
the bloodshed.

130
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,970
But how would you deal with
the recent incidents?

131
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:28,760
We've been under attack by
mobile suits from
Gundanium alloy...

132
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:30,300
...made in outer space.

133
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:34,380
These indestructible suits have
the Earth in a virtual crisis.

134
00:09:34,600 --> 00:09:37,610
What do the Specials think;
you fought with them.

135
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,440
We think they were made by the
colonies for purely
destructive purposes.

136
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:42,680
Hmmm!

137
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,680
What now, Treize?

138
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:47,890
All we need now is an actor from
the Alliance, yes?

139
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:49,020
An actor?

140
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,370
Someone to faithfully
demonstrate the true
feelings of the Alliance.

141
00:09:54,250 --> 00:09:58,490
It's natural for the colonies to
feel uneasiness toward us.

142
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:04,780
To nullify this uneasiness, we
must open up dialogue with the
colonies immediately.

143
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,440
I agree there.

144
00:10:06,530 --> 00:10:10,300
Let us begin a new chapter in
history through our discussions.

145
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:12,920
It’s not just between
the colonies.

146
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,890
We must focus almost all our
attention on more talks...

147
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:17,890
...between the nations
of the world.

B‐But what about the problem
with those mobile suits?

150
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,330
Once they understand our
desire for peace...

151
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:30,760
...the colonies will have no
cause for creating
such destruction.

152
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:31,980
Let's talk.

153
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,930
I'm sure we'll be able to find
our way once again.

154
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,930
I thought so.

155
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:39,730
The future's about to head in
the wrong direction.

00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,840
No, let's wait until the
final actors arrive.

158
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:48,200
Next, I'd like to focus on the
details of our peace
negotiations.

159
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,200
We'll start... (huh?)

160
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:53,160
What's going on here?!

161
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:55,160
Marshal! We're under attack!

162
00:10:55,160 --> 00:10:57,160
This base is under attack!

163
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,290
What?!

164
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,080
That's them.

165
00:11:20,770 --> 00:11:24,400
Whoa, this defense line
isn't like the others.

166
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:28,220
Ten times more of them.

167
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,060
That’s much more than
we estimated.

168
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:32,170
Well there's no
turning back now!

169
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,930
We're taking too long
trying to get through!

170
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:59,020
Let's move in for the kill!!

171
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:12,450
OS: There must be
something we can do

172
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:19,200
Lady Un, the actors
are all here.

173
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:21,920
Perhaps it’s time that we
raise the curtain.

174
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,080
Right!

175
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:26,740
OS: Lieutenant Zechs!...

176
00:12:26,740 --> 00:12:29,560
...we've received orders to
commence Operation Daybreak!

177
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,170
Roger, all units descent now!

178
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,640
Talk to those pilots!

179
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:05,090
Tell them we desire nothing but
peace with the colonies!

180
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:06,600
Impossible Marshal!...

181
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,700
The enemy's on an
all‐out attack!

182
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:12,440
We could receive considerable
damage wasting time talking!
(huh?)

183
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:16,920
Marshal, our priority
should be to evacuate.

184
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,120
Evacuate?

185
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,920
We can't risk your
getting slaughtered...

186
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,560
...while insisting on solving
the problem with the colonies
through peace negotiations.

187
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,450
I'll ignore your sarcasm.

188
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:29,000
But you're right, there's no
point getting killed.

189
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,660
Not if we're to promote
peace negotiations.

190
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,920
Then allow me to offer you our
high speed shuttle.

191
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,920
It's ready for
immediate take off.

192
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:40,780
I never would have expected such
assistance from you.

193
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:44,180
Marshall, I too am a member
of the Alliance.

194
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,460
You’re right. I’ll go.

195
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:47,890
This way please!

196
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:51,280
The shuttle is standing
by at gate B12!

197
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,940
General Septem, this way please.

198
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,460
I don't understand.

199
00:14:02,460 --> 00:14:04,460
I thought the shuttle
was that way.

200
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,000
I felt it safer for the
delegation to split up.

201
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,240
My personal shuttle is on
standby at gate F7.

202
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,160
There isn't room for many but
it’s the Specials' latest model.

203
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:17,570
In that case, I'll accompany you
in the other group.

204
00:14:17,570 --> 00:14:19,570
This way...

205
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:24,040
Get as many mobile suits
out as you can!

206
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:25,770
There are only two enemies!

207
00:14:25,770 --> 00:14:29,130
Colonel! Urgent message from our
Fairbanks Base! It's a revolt!

208
00:14:29,220 --> 00:14:32,040
The soldiers, they are
revolting against the base!

209
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,400
Colonel, sir..

210
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:36,220
...revolts are occurring
worldwide, one after the other.

211
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,220
What’s going on?

212
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,280
OS: Sergeant, it's no use,
let's surrender!

213
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:17,800
Don't be ridiculous!

214
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,800
Are you one of the
traitors as well?!

215
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:25,330
OS: Sergeant!

216
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,010
What can those
specials do anyway?!

217
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:29,410
Huh?

218
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,300
OS: This base is now
under our control!

219
00:15:35,540 --> 00:15:36,600
Surrender at once!

220
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:38,330
I'm not taking orders
from rebels!

221
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,120
Just see for yourself.

222
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,880
It’s a revolution.

223
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,380
I won't surrender!!

224
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:51,480
Don't overdo it,
Lieutenant Noin!

225
00:15:54,730 --> 00:15:57,260
Creating something new
is wonderful.

226
00:15:57,260 --> 00:16:02,720
But still, isn't this a bit
bloody for the laying
of a foundation?

227
00:16:04,210 --> 00:16:06,340
Your resistance is futile!

228
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:09,200
We need as many
comrades as possible!

229
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,820
The era of the
Alliance has ended!

230
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:16,100
Our OZ organization must give
birth to a true
alliance of it’s own.

231
00:16:16,530 --> 00:16:19,100
Let us creat a new
system together.

232
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:23,400
Not bad if I do say so myself.

233
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,100
[Narrator:] This coup d'Ètat had
been carefully planned.

234
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:31,530
OZ soldiers had hidden their
identities behind the Specials'
facade...

235
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,020
...and were posted at each
Alliance military base.

236
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:40,420
Since the undermining began from
within the over‐populated
organization of the Alliance...

237
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,500
...the damage to its governing
body was significant.

238
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:46,210
Rebellious groups have taken
over bases worldwide...

239
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:48,210
...in Asia, Europe,
and even Africa.

240
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,370
So where is Marshal Noventa?

241
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:53,080
I don't know! I can't
find any of them!

242
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:55,960
What in the world is
going on here?

243
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:18,960
Crap! They just keep coming!
Huh?

244
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,300
This are missiles?!
Aimed at us allies!

245
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:48,850
'Cause you're all bunched up.

246
00:17:58,770 --> 00:18:00,740
No time to sit and chat!

247
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,330
I got lot’s of work to do!

248
00:18:12,460 --> 00:18:14,320
Are they OZ's newest models?

249
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:14,980
Yeah!

250
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:16,980
But they're attacking
the Alliance!

251
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:26,440
Trowa!

252
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:28,940
Those mobile suits are
just like ours!

253
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,450
Could they also be...?!

254
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,080
Whatever they are, they're
right in my way!

255
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Those suits are identical!

256
00:18:37,580 --> 00:18:38,850
What's wrong?!

257
00:18:38,850 --> 00:18:40,480
Why haven't we left yet?!

258
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:43,250
We're waiting for Marshal
Noventa's shuttle to leave.

259
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,250
We'll leave right after them.

260
00:18:53,730 --> 00:18:55,060
That's the one!

261
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:01,240
It's an unfortunate coincidence.

262
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:03,890
But I won't let it obstruct
our peace proposal.

263
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,050
M‐Marshal!!

264
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:08,460
What on earth...?!

265
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:19,640
Now, young man don't be foolish!

266
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,180
Mission accomplished.

267
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:32,120
The Alliance Leader Shuttle!

268
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:33,620
What have they done?!

269
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,490
Marshal Noventa...!

270
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,200
Thanks for those missiles
earlier, buddy!

271
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,300
Now I'll return the favor!

272
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,020
Cut it out, you guys!

273
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:21,090
OS: Haven't you gotten tired of
these meaningless battles yet?

274
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,530
What do you mean?

275
00:20:30,290 --> 00:20:32,060
Don't you guys realize?

276
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,610
You've all been lured into OZ's
devious little trap!

277
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:36,500
We what?!

278
00:20:37,290 --> 00:20:39,130
Check out the Alliance's report!

279
00:20:39,130 --> 00:20:42,360
You guys just wiped out the
Alliance's pacifists.

280
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,440
Impossible!

281
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:48,170
It's the colonies' declaration
of war against us!

282
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:52,290
We were discussing plans for
peace talks with the
colonies today.

283
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:55,220
Marshal Noventa was at the
center of these plans...

284
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,920
...and he's been assassinated!

285
00:20:57,050 --> 00:21:00,140
He was killed by the colonies'
invading mobile suits!

286
00:21:00,610 --> 00:21:01,690
I repeat!

287
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,610
This was a brutal invasion
by the colonies!

288
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,080
Heero...

289
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,490
We will not yield to
the colonies!

290
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:18,490
We must fight them to
the bitter end!

291
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:23,090
Very nicely done,
General Septem.

292
00:21:23,090 --> 00:21:25,530
We won't be needing
you any further.

293
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:26,460
What...?

294
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,980
[AAARGHH]

295
00:21:29,290 --> 00:21:31,050
A magnificent performance.

296
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:34,340
It's a pity you had to leave
the stage so early.

297
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:42,780
Well, we can't have any
bloodstains in Treize's
wake now can we?

298
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:48,340
The second act has just begun.

299
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:50,340
We'll be busy.

300
00:21:53,530 --> 00:21:56,220
It was all planned out by OZ.

301
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:57,770
We became their puppets.

302
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:00,400
Controlled by Treize
Khushrenada.

303
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,760
No...how awful!

304
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:04,220
Damn him!

305
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,530
But I’m gonna fight you OZ.

306
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,690
Even if I've got to do
it on my own!

307
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:16,240
What have I... What have I done?

[MUSIC]

310
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:45,551
[Narrator:] After being
controlled like puppets,

311
00:23:45,686 --> 00:23:47,820
the Gundams become Lady
Une's next target.

312

Heero, Duo and Quatre move in to
prevent the explosion of the
New Edwards Base...

...while Wu Fei and Trowa head
straight for Treize.

314
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,520
Treize is cornered by
Wu Fei's sword.
