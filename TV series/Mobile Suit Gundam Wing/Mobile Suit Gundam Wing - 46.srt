00:00:12,382 --> 00:00:16,190
GUNDAM WING

3
00:01:26,988 --> 00:01:31,284
[NARRATOR] By having Relena
Peacecraft join the
Romefeller Foundation

4
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:35,066
as their representative and a
symbol of peace,
they are able to

5
00:01:35,066 --> 00:01:40,178
gain the support of the people
and are justified in making

6
00:01:40,238 --> 00:01:45,189
the World Nation a reality.
Meanwhile in space armed

7
00:01:45,189 --> 00:01:50,931
citizens who oppose Oz's
colonial rule rise in
every colony

8
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:55,341
and start a movement for
independence under the name

9
00:01:55,371 --> 00:01:57,776
White Fang.

10
00:01:57,776 --> 00:02:01,985
The year is After Colony 195.
Wars are intensifying,
and hurling

11
00:02:02,025 --> 00:02:04,731
the era toward drastic changes.

12
00:02:04,761 --> 00:02:10,804
If she dies then we can
eliminate this fake peace AND
the World Nation.

13
00:02:10,845 --> 00:02:15,154
Relena... I'm going to kill you.

14
00:02:15,354 --> 00:02:20,496
[HEERO] A New Leader.

15
00:02:20,716 --> 00:02:23,953
[HOWARD] Let's summarize the
present situation.

16
00:02:23,953 --> 00:02:28,453
On Earth Romefeller is taking
advantage of Relena Peacecraft.

17
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:32,802
And it looks like they're trying
to consolidate all
of its powers.

18
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:37,583
Now it's possible that Relena is
in fact taking advantage

19
00:02:37,613 --> 00:02:40,790
of Romefeller. But either way
the Earth is heading

20
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:44,137
towards peace. The problem lies
with the recent chaos

21
00:02:44,167 --> 00:02:47,895
here in space. There are 5
different powers involved.

22
00:02:47,895 --> 00:02:51,213
Do you really think there are
that many powers? ‐ Yeah!

23
00:02:51,213 --> 00:02:55,191
First there's the White Fang.
They pose the biggest
problem of all.

24
00:02:55,251 --> 00:02:59,491
The question is what do they
plan to do with that
gigantic battleship

25
00:02:59,491 --> 00:03:02,868
they seized from Oz? [SOLDIER]
It's still under construction.

26
00:03:02,868 --> 00:03:05,333
I expect they'll use it against
the OZ space force.

27
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:09,543
Sure they will since the Oz
space force is one of
the other powers.

28
00:03:09,593 --> 00:03:12,225
[HOWARD] The White Fang
has the upper hand

29
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,295
but Oz's space fortress Barge
is still operating.

30
00:03:15,295 --> 00:03:19,244
The battle between these two is
the most significant,
don't you think?

31
00:03:19,244 --> 00:03:23,373
Yeah but don't forget about the
Gundams &amp; their guerrilla
attacks against the 2.

32
00:03:23,403 --> 00:03:27,352
OK that's 3 powers but who are
the other 2 then?

33
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:31,992
I suppose neither is actually
strong enough to be
considered a true power.

34
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:36,341
[HOWARD] One is the group of
colony citizens not
associated with the

35
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:40,290
White Fang. Their numbers are
far greater but they
lack organization.

36
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:42,184
[SOLDIER] And the other power?

37
00:03:42,184 --> 00:03:44,469
Why that would be ourselves,
of course.

38
00:03:44,469 --> 00:03:45,301
Right!

39
00:03:45,301 --> 00:03:47,506
[HOWARD] We'll team up with
the Gundams. ‐Huh?

40
00:03:47,506 --> 00:03:49,680
[HOWARD] Just as Zechs planned.

41
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,406
Speaking of which
that reminds me.

42
00:03:52,406 --> 00:03:56,585
[HOWARD] Why hasn't he come back
here since he left for Earth?

43
00:03:56,846 --> 00:04:01,767
[SOLDIER] The Earth is about to
welcome a new era of peace.

44
00:04:01,827 --> 00:04:05,876
Abide by Queen Relena's orders
and discard your weapons NOW.

45
00:04:05,886 --> 00:04:07,579
[PILOT] You call this peace?

46
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:10,305
You're just trying to swipe
all our weapons

47
00:04:10,305 --> 00:04:12,620
and strengthen Oz's own
position to govern.

48
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,567
[SOLDIER] Destroy everyone
who defiles peace.

49
00:04:15,687 --> 00:04:18,804
[BATTLE SOUNDS]

50
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,086
Don't give up, men!

51
00:04:30,259 --> 00:04:32,353
Huh? What's that?

52
00:04:37,585 --> 00:04:39,940
A Gundam?!

53
00:04:51,044 --> 00:04:56,747
It's a Gundam! The Gundam's
gonna fight Oz just like before.

54
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:02,239
What's a Gundam doing siding
with the guerrillas?

55
00:05:05,075 --> 00:05:07,169
No!!!

56
00:05:13,263 --> 00:05:16,450
Relena, you're a figurehead. And
what you've created is

57
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:21,000
nothing more than a fake peace.

58
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,319
[RELENA] Romefeller might take
away my freedom. No...

59
00:05:25,349 --> 00:05:28,476
They might in fact end
up killing me.

60
00:05:28,787 --> 00:05:35,772
Still, as it stands, Romefeller
will use me to
continue this war.

61
00:05:36,574 --> 00:05:39,610
[WERIDGE] Queen Relena! ‐ Huh?

62
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:46,425
It has come to my attention that
you have your own policy
with regard to

63
00:05:46,425 --> 00:05:48,971
forming the World Nation.

64
00:05:49,662 --> 00:05:53,350
Right now people still feel
that the Romefeller

65
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:56,637
Foundation is using its power to
exercise control over them.

66
00:05:56,637 --> 00:06:00,997
[RELENA] What Romefeller needs
to do is set an example on
how to correctly

67
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,490
bring peace to the world.

68
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,557
And tell me exactly how would we
do that Queen Relena?

69
00:06:05,557 --> 00:06:08,724
By withdrawing all the Oz
troops that are posted

70
00:06:08,724 --> 00:06:12,342
around the world under the
pretense of maintaining peace.

71
00:06:12,342 --> 00:06:13,745
[DERMAIL] I object!

72
00:06:13,745 --> 00:06:16,230
And then we can clearly
announce to the

73
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:19,527
people that the period of
military rule has
come to an end.

74
00:06:19,527 --> 00:06:24,538
I must object! I have to argue
that those are grossly
simplistic ideas.

75
00:06:24,538 --> 00:06:28,627
You haven't considered the
guerrillas stationed
around the world

76
00:06:28,627 --> 00:06:32,235
or the military force of the
independent nations
that still remain

77
00:06:32,235 --> 00:06:34,019
a threat to us.

78
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:36,424
The threat is Romefeller,
not them.

79
00:06:36,444 --> 00:06:40,152
[RELENA] When a ruler calls upon
others to discard their weapons

80
00:06:40,192 --> 00:06:42,688
naturally the ruler must be
the first to do so.

81
00:06:42,688 --> 00:06:46,216
[DERMAIL] Listen to me, Queen
Relena. That is not how we

82
00:06:46,216 --> 00:06:50,365
at the Romefeller Foundation
intend to govern the world.

83
00:06:50,365 --> 00:06:54,223
Considering that the foundation
is supposedly
bringing peace to the

84
00:06:54,223 --> 00:06:58,071
world the time has come for
Romefeller to make some changes.

85
00:06:58,071 --> 00:07:02,080
There's no need for us to change
any of our traditions.

86
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,931
I suspect those might be your
own personal opinions,
Duke Dermail

87
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:10,899
Or are they the opinions shared
by the foundation?

88
00:07:10,899 --> 00:07:13,545
Obviously I believe I'm speaking

89
00:07:13,585 --> 00:07:16,231
for the Romefeller
Foundation in its entirety.

90
00:07:16,231 --> 00:07:19,198
[RELENA] And is he speaking
for you gentlemen?

91
00:07:19,278 --> 00:07:23,327
[MAN] Uh no we haven't really
come to a consensus on
these issues.

92
00:07:23,367 --> 00:07:24,329
Wha‐

93
00:07:24,329 --> 00:07:27,736
Well I do believe Queen Relena
has a good point.

94
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:29,901
Don't be ridiculous!

95
00:07:29,901 --> 00:07:35,032
Are you saying a couple of words
from this girl should
change Romefeller?

96
00:07:41,526 --> 00:07:44,854
I'm afraid I let my emotions
get the better of me.

97
00:07:44,974 --> 00:07:49,143
I just wanted to call your
attention to the
potential risk in basing

98
00:07:49,143 --> 00:07:53,953
our plans for the future on the
sole opinions of Queen
Relena gentlemen.

99
00:07:53,953 --> 00:07:57,641
This isn't a subject to be taken
lightly so we shall

100
00:07:57,641 --> 00:08:01,169
bring it up at the foundation's
general meeting tomorrow.

101
00:08:01,169 --> 00:08:04,096
[WERIDGE] This executive
meeting is now adjourned.

102
00:08:04,697 --> 00:08:09,467
[DUO] We probably got no choice
but to give up on Wu Fey.

103
00:08:09,467 --> 00:08:12,995
He's gonna do what he wants
all on his own.

104
00:08:12,995 --> 00:08:16,122
Then you think we should head
back to the Earth for now?

105
00:08:16,122 --> 00:08:19,970
But miss Noin! There are White
Fang troops roaming
the vicinity.

106
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,335
It would be hard to
get past them.

107
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:26,063
Don't you think we should do
something to stop
the White Fang?

108
00:08:26,063 --> 00:08:30,313
If Miss Relena were here she'd
work out a peace plan
with the colonies.

109
00:08:30,313 --> 00:08:33,279
Negotiations with the White Fang
can take place afterward.

110
00:08:33,319 --> 00:08:37,528
Right. But the White Fang is
increasing its armaments.
Even though the

111
00:08:37,528 --> 00:08:40,776
people of the colonies
musn't use them.

112
00:08:40,856 --> 00:08:42,580
[LOUD BEEPING] [DUO]
What's that?

113
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:46,348
An encoded transmission. It's
being broadcast in this area.
Oh...

114
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:48,753
There's a message here to
the Deathscythe.

115
00:08:48,753 --> 00:08:50,597
To the Deathscythe?!

116
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,886
Duo! Can you hear me?

117
00:08:54,886 --> 00:08:57,572
Hey Howard! Is that you Howard?

118
00:08:57,612 --> 00:09:02,383
How would you like me to come
and fix up your Gundam just
like the old days?

119
00:09:02,383 --> 00:09:06,792
Of course I'll give you full
supplies and repairs.

120
00:09:06,792 --> 00:09:10,520
What are you doing out
here in space?

121
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:15,572
What's happening here? Even the
leading executives of the
foundation won't

122
00:09:15,612 --> 00:09:17,776
listen to my opinions.

123
00:09:17,776 --> 00:09:21,464
Do they all intend to follow
Relena's proposals?

124
00:09:21,464 --> 00:09:25,193
It just goes to show you how
strong Miss Relena really is.

125
00:09:25,193 --> 00:09:30,284
[DERMAIL] I brought Relena here
in order to unify Oz. But
now she's in my way.

126
00:09:30,324 --> 00:09:32,689
I'll just have to...

127
00:09:32,689 --> 00:09:36,778
Don't even think about it
grandpa. Because if anything
were to happen to

128
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:40,426
Miss Relena now you can be sure
you would be the
first one accused.

129
00:09:40,426 --> 00:09:43,713
And at the moment you don't have
enough influence in
the foundation

130
00:09:43,713 --> 00:09:46,198
to persuade them of
your innocence.

131
00:09:46,198 --> 00:09:49,526
You don't beat around the bush
Dorothy. But you're
absolutely right.

132
00:09:49,526 --> 00:09:53,013
The foundation is becoming a bit
unstable. We need a powerful

133
00:09:53,013 --> 00:09:57,663
leader who can bring everyone
together. But Relena's
not that person.

134
00:09:57,703 --> 00:10:00,870
She was only supposed to be
a symbol to unify

135
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:02,995
Oz with the general public.

136
00:10:03,035 --> 00:10:07,124
That's true and I can't imagine
that Miss Relena's
strategy for peace will

137
00:10:07,124 --> 00:10:11,774
advance very smoothly. Military
intervention will
become necessary.

138
00:10:11,814 --> 00:10:15,743
Someone who supported military
power would quickly be
recognized by

139
00:10:15,863 --> 00:10:18,589
everybody as an
effective leader.

140
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:22,838
But Relena's trying to dismantle
Romefeller's military power!

141
00:10:22,838 --> 00:10:27,248
You can still deploy the Oz
space force can't you
grandfather?

142
00:10:27,649 --> 00:10:31,617
Are you suggesting I go
into outer space?

143
00:10:31,658 --> 00:10:34,985
Well you won't be able to
get your point

144
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,671
across at the general
meeting tomorrow.

145
00:10:37,671 --> 00:10:40,637
They will all want to hear what
Miss Relena has to say.

146
00:10:40,717 --> 00:10:44,766
[DOROTHY] So rather than fight a
battle you know you'll lose
you should gather

147
00:10:44,806 --> 00:10:48,053
your military power and prepare

our troops are currently on the

00:21:34,052 --> 00:21:37,702
I declare that we will
eliminate the Earth;

298
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:40,412
The force that
conflicts with space.

299
00:21:40,412 --> 00:21:42,682
No way! ‐ What are you
saying Zechs?

300
00:21:42,682 --> 00:21:46,502
[RELENA] My own brother... Oh
but why. Even
Romefeller is making...

301
00:21:46,502 --> 00:21:48,862
changes to improve itself now.

302
00:21:48,902 --> 00:21:53,662
[HEERO] Zechs you've chosen one
of the futures Epyon showed you.

303
00:21:53,662 --> 00:21:59,832
Well out of the futures that
Wing Zero showed me I've
chosen this one.

Relena of her position as
Romefeller's chief

307
00:23:44,036 --> 00:23:46,982
representative. Meanwhile
a battle for the

308
00:23:46,982 --> 00:23:49,526
space fortress Barge
commences in outer space

309
00:23:49,546 --> 00:23:52,496
to determine the supreme power.

310
00:23:52,496 --> 00:23:56,376
Using its overpowering number
of mobile dolls the

311
00:23:56,376 --> 00:24:00,406
White Fang force repeatedly
crushes OZ's mobile doll troops.
