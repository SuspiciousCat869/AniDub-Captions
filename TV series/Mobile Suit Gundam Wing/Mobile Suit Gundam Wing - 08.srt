<i>Talk to me Heero!</i>

332
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:32,800
Relena...

333
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:34,620
Heero.

334
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,820
You’re in over your head.

335
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,580
[gasp]

336
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,480
Say goodbye Relena.

337
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:45,480
[gun shot]

338
00:19:45,480 --> 00:19:47,480
[grunting]

339
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:49,170
Aah!

340
00:19:51,910 --> 00:19:52,970
Heero...

341
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,110
Ugh!

342
00:19:55,170 --> 00:19:56,140
Who are you?

343
00:19:56,140 --> 00:19:57,820
[♪♪]

344
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:02,140
It's pretty obvious to anyone
that you’re the bad guy here.

345
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:04,020
are you alright lady?

346
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,110
Huh?

347
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:08,420
Heero, are you okay?

348
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:09,310
[groaning]

349
00:20:09,310 --> 00:20:11,140
[gun shot]

350
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,020
Uargh!

351
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,970
Uagh...

352
00:20:15,020 --> 00:20:16,370
Dont overdue it,

353
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,250
Remember you’re injured.

354
00:20:20,510 --> 00:20:23,310
Stop it, what do you
want to shoot him for!?

355
00:20:24,110 --> 00:20:25,510
Hey, wait a minute...

356
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,280
Great, how come I end up
as the bad guy here?

357
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:39,970
Huh?

358
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,220
It’s already reached the surface.

359
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,620
I must have miss
calculated the tide.

360
00:20:49,050 --> 00:20:51,480
What in the world is that? Ah!

361
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,140
Don't look lady.

362
00:20:53,420 --> 00:20:55,850
I’m sure you’ve got your
reasons for being here,

363
00:20:55,910 --> 00:20:57,850
but you better just walk away.

364
00:20:57,850 --> 00:20:59,850
You’ve made yourself
a lot of grief.

365
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,140
[grunting]

366
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,280
You haven’t had enough!?

367
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,480
[gun shots]

368
00:21:04,650 --> 00:21:06,400
Its my Mobile Suit.

369
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,400
Hua argh!

370
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:13,120
[♪♪]

371
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,710
‐What're ya doin’ you fool!?

372
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,020
Finally, everything is finished.

373
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,140
Mission complete, ugh...

374
00:21:40,650 --> 00:21:42,570
Nooo!

375
00:21:48,310 --> 00:21:51,850
Dammit, he knows Gundanium's
impact tolerance.

376
00:21:52,450 --> 00:21:55,250
Which means, he’s
the Mobile Suit’s pilot.

377
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:58,820
[♪♪]

378
00:21:58,910 --> 00:21:59,940
What's happening...

379
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,940
who are these guys?

380
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:03,650
<i>Lieutenant Zechs,</i>

381
00:22:03,650 --> 00:22:06,370
<i>I’ve lost all communications</i>
<i>with Cancer and Pices.</i>

382
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:08,370
I see...

383
00:22:09,540 --> 00:22:11,480
Theres a jinx that once
you see a Gundam,

384
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,280
You won’t come out alive.

385
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,110
I hope the jinx doesn’t come true.

386
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:23,540
<i>To Be Continued</i>

393
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:46,220
plans Heero's escape.

394
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,180
Zechs predicts that a Gundam

395
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,380
will be attacking the Aries...

396
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:50,820
...at the Alliance Military Base

397
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,300
