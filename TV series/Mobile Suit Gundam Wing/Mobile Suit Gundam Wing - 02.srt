their retaliatory intentions.

The Gundam's target is OZ, who
had masked its identity

7
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,460
within the mobile suit troops of
the Alliance military.

8
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:42,710
The Gundams' had a number of
missions to attack OZ.

The year is After Colony 195.

OZ has finally taken
center stage.

With an army of elite soldiers
at his command...

...Treize Khushrenada carries
out his plans to destroy the
Alliance Military.

The battle between the mobile

like a bunch of puppets.

00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:17,310

Let's go after Treize! We can
still catch up with him!

00:03:22,660 --> 00:03:24,080
That's not wise!

00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,570
Stay outta my way, you want
me to shoot you?!

25
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:30,350
Our missions have always focused
on attacking when they
least expect it.

26
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,170
But now the enemy clearly has
the advantage right now.

Yeah I see what your saying,
kid.

28
00:03:50,370 --> 00:03:52,480
So we didn't get them all!

Either way, Let's get
out of here!

Good. He should be able to get

How are we going to handle those
Gundams at New Edwards base?

I'll leave that up to you.

To New Edwards?

46
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,220
That won't be necessary.

47
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,950
All you need to do is to
activate the missile
self‐detonation devices...

48
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,440
... which are at New Edwards.

Self‐detonation devices?

[OS:] If I remember correctly
you can activate them
from where you are.

00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:19,710
That's correct.

52
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:21,060
Then get to it!

53
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:23,100
That's over‐kill.

54
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:27,020
Demolishing an entire base just
to kill off a few mobile suits?

00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,610
The Earth Sphere
Alliance Military

56
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:32,120
didn't even have the guts to do
something this simple.

of aircraft asking for
permission to land.

60
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,370
Probably the ones that escaped
from New Edwards!

61
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,720
This just doesn't make any
sense. It's far too chaotic to

destroy the Gundams along
with the base!

won't make any difference.

...and if they were to
explode at once...

105
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:15,070
...it would instantly wipe out a
radius of about 300 kilometers!

We can't possibly get a
way safely now!

You'd be able to cover that
distance in time.

Yes.

I understand. Who would ever
believe such a thing?

But I can believe it. I'm
proud of that kid.

I'm surprised. That's
not like you.

148
00:11:48,030 --> 00:11:49,920
How were you planning
to destroy them?

149
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,650
I attempted to activate the
self‐detonation devices...

...at the missles at the

And so?

The Gundams deactivated the
bombs and prevented
the explosion.

153

We were saved by the Gundams.

Hmm?

155
00:12:06,510 --> 00:12:10,840
The Earth is a confined area. We

Human beings are weak and
vulnerable. Anybody is capable
of killing anyone.

157
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:20,430
But we mustn't abuse
this capability.

158
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:24,300
This time around we'll just have
to give our thanks to
the Gundams.

159
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:29,370
Oh and Lady Une, you must learn
more about the OZ organization.

160
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,540
I'm sorry. I'll try harder.

161
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,400
Even after all this damage
there's still no sign
of surrendering.

162
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:52,410
Brigadier‐General Daigo
Onegell's such a tenacious man.

163
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,230
But I hope he's also a
hateful person.

164
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:58,800
Otherwise Zechs feelings
could be undermined.

165
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,360
How dare you!

166
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:03,980
Were you expecting the Alliance
Headquarters to fall
that easily?

167
00:13:04,080 --> 00:13:07,070
I'm not letting OZ come one step
closer to this base!

168
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:10,140
I agree that security at this
base is splendid.

169
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:15,240
But if there were even a brief
moment of carelessness
among your people...

170
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,760
...this base would be taken
over immediately.

171
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,510
Lieutenant Zechs Marquise!!

172
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:26,120
So you did know it was me
afterall. You were extremely
cautious around...

173
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,870
...me during the
Alliance days...

174
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:31,080
...so I thought you could tell
me apart from all the
other people.

175
00:13:32,190 --> 00:13:35,790
It was the era we were in. The
war made me do those things!

176
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:39,720
It wasn't my personal desire,
but the Alliance's
decision as a whole...

177
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:41,720
...to annihilate the
Sanc Kingdom.

178
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:45,680
The Sanc Kingdom had no
intention of resisting
against the Alliance.

179
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:48,810
But you staged an attack and
destroyed the Kingdom anyway.

180
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:52,350
When at the time many countries
opposed the expanding
military powers...

181
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,240
...of the United Earth
Sphere Alliance.

182
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:57,480
The Sanc Kingdom was only one
of those opposed.

183
00:13:57,480 --> 00:14:00,400
You declared that you could
eliminate the cause of
the retaliation...

184
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:03,370
...by sweeping away the Royal
family since it had an influence

185
00:14:03,370 --> 00:14:06,350
on the neighboring countries.
You personally lead the attack!

186
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,760
Milliard Peacecraft

187
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:30,910
May you rest in peace the
betrayed and outraged

188
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,910
Milliard Peacecraft.

189
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,690
Learn about OZ...

190
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:46,990
Is it possible that I don't
understand Mr. Treize?

191
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,890
That just couldn't be.

192
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,040
Captain. Two carriers from the
505 support troops

193
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,040
are trying to establish
contact with us.

194
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,010
What type of carriers?

195
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,010
Aries, from our own forces.

196
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,550
Contact approved.

197
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:02,890
This is Big Nose; please
begin communication!

198
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:06,400
Hold on, just which base did
those carriers come from?

199
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:08,400
From the New Edwards base.

200
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:11,280
You fools! Those are enemies!

201
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,670
The other carrier's headed for
this Mother Ship!

202
00:15:20,670 --> 00:15:22,670
Then shoot it down!

203
00:15:22,670 --> 00:15:24,670
[GUNFIRE]

204
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:31,100
I'm starting to run out of fuel.

205
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:33,920
This carrier wouldn't cause too
much of an explosion.

206
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:36,990
So I'm going to have to exit
on the mobile suit.

207
00:15:39,080 --> 00:15:41,070
[EXPLOSIONS]

208
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:52,640
It's a Gundam! A Gundam
is on the ship!

209
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,640
What?! On the ship?!

210
00:15:54,640 --> 00:15:56,220
Fight him with the Leos!

211
00:16:13,100 --> 00:16:14,830
Twenty Leos have been destroyed!

212
00:16:14,830 --> 00:16:18,990
What is your problem?! Throw him
into the sea and get him
with the Cancer!

213
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,810
Where is Mr. Treize's ship?!

214
00:16:20,810 --> 00:16:22,810
It sailed away from the
rest of the fleet!

215
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:23,950
Good!

216
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,540
Must be this one!

217
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:33,530
It's a Gundam! This one came out
of the carrier that went down!

218
00:16:33,530 --> 00:16:35,100
It... what?!

219
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:40,830
The Gundam on the ship has
destroyed the bridge!

220
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,450
70% of our Leos have
been destroyed!

221
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:44,940
Can't we use the Aries?!

222
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:48,060
No Sir, all of our elevators
will be targeted!

223
00:16:49,180 --> 00:16:51,640
Why now; on this happy day of
our new beginning!

224
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:55,120
Lieutenant Colonel Lady Une!
Gundam's still
attacking on the ship!

225
00:16:55,690 --> 00:16:59,280
I told you already, throw him
into the sea!! There's no need

226
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:02,700
to inform me of his every move,
you just follow my orders!

227
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:04,140
Right... Yes, ma'am!

228
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,140
Gundam's on the takeoff
catapult line!

229
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:10,910
Good! Get a Leo on the catapult
and shoot that Gundam
into the sea!

230
00:17:39,900 --> 00:17:41,230
How are preparations?

231
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:42,120
Complete!

232
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,710
With this advanced mobility
option, it should move
like an Aries!

233
00:17:48,830 --> 00:17:51,690
Just as long as I can shoot down
that other Gundam!

234
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:55,770
And that Gundam's attacking Mr.
Treize's ship?! Well, not
for much longer!

235
00:18:05,980 --> 00:18:08,910
Destination reached! Here I go,
Nataku!

236
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,080
Don't be so sure of yourself,
Gundam!

237
00:18:34,510 --> 00:18:37,100
You're not getting one step
closer to that ship!

238
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:41,880
Nobody can stop me, even you.

239
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:03,260
I wasn't expecting this much
resistance, but it's
game‐over now!!

240
00:19:03,260 --> 00:19:04,380
You die!!

241
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,310
Stupid move, getting emotional.

242
00:19:17,680 --> 00:19:21,390
Step aside! You can see for
yourself that you'll
never beat me.

243
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:26,080
I never knew Gundams were so
powerful. I want him dead.

244
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
[FOG HORN]

245
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:31,520
Huh? Mr. Treize!

246
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:34,670
Looks like your superior wants
to fight with me!

247
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:36,320
Fine by me!

248
00:19:36,460 --> 00:19:38,300
I'll stop him in his tracks!

249
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,480
Mr. Treize, it's dangerous!
Get away from here!

250
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,800
Lady Une...

251
00:19:46,890 --> 00:19:48,270
...Leave him to me.

252
00:19:48,910 --> 00:19:50,360
But Mr. Treize...

253
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,810
So you're Treize. You
better be my guy.

254
00:20:15,450 --> 00:20:17,180
I'll gladly accept.

255
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,560
My name is Wu Fei!

256
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:31,560
I'm Treize Khushrenada.

257
00:20:57,370 --> 00:20:59,240
The duel is mine.

258
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:01,660
Kill me!

259
00:21:05,790 --> 00:21:07,340
It was a good fight.

260
00:21:07,340 --> 00:21:09,160
If you don't kill me right now

261
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:12,040
I'll keep on coming back until
I get you, Treize.

262
00:21:12,280 --> 00:21:13,850
That sounds interesting.

263
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:16,080
I hope we can battle again.

264
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,080
Arrrgh!

265
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:33,850
Mr. Treize, how can you let that
Gundam pilot make his escape?

266
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:37,520
He's the pilot of one of those
mobile suits therefor I thought

267
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,350
it'd be fair for me to give
him another chance.

268
00:21:40,730 --> 00:21:44,160
It was honorable of him to get
off the mobile suit and
duel with me.

269
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:48,110
I respect that in him and I can
see why he makes such a
good Gundam pilot!

270
00:21:48,110 --> 00:21:52,160
Next time we'll have to fight
using his specialty:
the mobile suits.

271
00:21:52,160 --> 00:21:54,160
But Mr. Treize...

272
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:07,660
Did that guy actually
accomplish his mission?

273
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:09,660
Hey you, can you hear me?!

274
00:22:14,090 --> 00:22:16,300
I understand. Let's
just drop it.

275
00:22:21,660 --> 00:22:24,240
[To be continued]

[Narrator:] The United Earth
Sphere Alliance collapses...

277
00:23:40,350 --> 00:23:42,920
...and the world heads down
a path to chaos.

278

With all their might, Heero and
Duo must continue to
battle OZ...

...the reason behind this chaos.
