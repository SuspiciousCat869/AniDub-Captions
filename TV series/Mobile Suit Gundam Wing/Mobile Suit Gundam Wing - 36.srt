1
00:00:11,420 --> 00:00:14,440
[MUSIC]

2
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:27,130
The attacks by the five Gundams
sent by the Space Colonies...

3
00:01:27,130 --> 00:01:29,640
...reflected their
retaliatory intentions.

4
00:01:30,160 --> 00:01:33,920
The Gundam's target is OZ who
had masked its identity

5
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,150
within the mobile suit troops of
the Alliance Military...

6
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,460
...and the Gundams' had a number
of missions to attack OZ.

7
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:47,850
The year is After Colony 195.

8
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:50,570
OZ has finally taken
center stage.

9
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:52,680
With an army of elite soldiers

10
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,680
at his command...

11
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,200
...Treize Khushrenada
carries out his plans

12
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
to destroy the
Alliance Military.

13
00:01:58,670 --> 00:01:59,900
The battle between the

14
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,310
mobile suits sent to Earth...

15
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:05,020
...and OZ, causes the Earth to
shudder violently.

16
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:11,040
It's up to you now, go
for it Heero!

17
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,290
He's got a 10 percent chance of
success, but that guy can
do it for sure.

18
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,120
What a mission.

19
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,460
I failed...

20
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,260
...I totally failed!!

21
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,690
[NARRATOR:] Portrait of a
Ruined Country

22
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:28,750
Thanks to the Lightning Count,

23
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:31,480
we were able to keep the town
from being demolished.

24
00:02:34,110 --> 00:02:35,480
The Alliance is likely

25
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:36,990
regrouping their
remaining force...

26
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,840
...following the
unexpected attack.

27
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,300
We'll use this base as our

28
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:42,300
headquarters for
subsequent fights.

29
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:44,400
The beauty of these towns

30
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,670
doesn't change no
matter who rules.

31
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,630
Noin...

32
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,480
OZ's objective isn't to rule.

33
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,850
It's to free countries from

34
00:02:51,850 --> 00:02:54,620
the United Earth Sphere
Alliance stranglehold...

35
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:56,620
Currently, you mean.

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,540
This might be somewhat unnatural

37
00:02:58,540 --> 00:02:59,610
coming from me...

38
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,140
...but I believe that due
respect should be given

39
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,760
to OZ for allowing countries
a second chance...

40
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:07,000
...to correct the mistake of
forming the Alliance

41
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,190
in the first place.

42
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,270
The mobile suit carrier from

43
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,270
Victoria Base is about
to arrive, Sir.

44
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,930
They're here.

45
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:33,550
Otto, I'm so glad to see you!

46
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,970
I've returned, Lieutenant.

47
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,100
You need to rest.

48
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:40,440
Are you alright?

49
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,780
Lieutenant Otto shouldn't
even be standing!

50
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,250
His ribs are broken, and

51
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,250
he has internal injuries.

52
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,250
Keep it to yourself.

53
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:50,540
Lieutenant Zechs.

54
00:03:50,750 --> 00:03:52,010
This Tallgeese you've been

55
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,320
waiting for is one vicious suit.

56
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,310
This is Tallgeese...

57
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:09,680
It doesn't look anything at
all like a thing that

58
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,300
was scrapped midway
20 years ago.

59
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:13,930
The revolution speed

60
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:15,450
applied by the verniers...

61
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,750
...allows it to reach more than

62
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,520
three times that of the Aries.

63
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:21,320
We were unable to determine
its maximum speed.

64
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:23,290
I passed out during the trials.

65
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,800
You were the test pilot?!

66
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:27,600
The Tallgeese is not a
suit that can be

67
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,200
controlled by just anyone.

68
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:30,860
Excluding you, Sir.

69
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,860
Aren't you overrating my skills?

70
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,860
No, I trust your abilities.

71
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:36,970
All right.

72
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,780
I'll be using this right away.

73
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:40,780
I'm sorry for all the trouble.

74
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,780
Take him to the medical room.

75
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:43,630
Sir!

76
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,200
Noin.

77
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,540
Have the mobile suit troops

78
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,840
ready to leave at once.

79
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,610
We'll head for the
Sanc Kingdom base

80
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,610
of the United Earth
Sphere Alliance.

81
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,040
The Sanc Kingdom?

82
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:00,890
We're freeing them from
the Alliance.

83
00:05:00,890 --> 00:05:02,890
Any objections to this mission?

84
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,170
No, Lieutenant!

85
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:06,170
I'm going on the Tallgeese.

86
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:08,380
Without even a test ride?

87
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,120
Isn't that dangerous?

88
00:05:10,120 --> 00:05:12,840
Don't worry, I'll be taking it
easy, but you know

89
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,350
I'll be taking my chances with
this mobile suit.

90
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:20,170
Sanc Kingdom.

91
00:05:20,780 --> 00:05:22,700
Zechs' home town.

92
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:31,720
Heero!

93
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:36,960
Hey!

94
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,820
Nice shot, Heero!

95
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:47,500
Amazing Duo! Great job...
way to go, Heero!

96
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:49,800
Hey! Wave back or something!

97
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,800
They're cheering for us,
superstar!

98
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,980
So this is where you went.

99
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,010
You know, that's pretty smart.

100
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:06,010
Changing schools when
you've gotta move on.

101
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:09,870
And after all, it's natural for
people our age to be in school.

102
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:11,290
What's the idea?

103
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:13,980
I'm just trying to act normal.

104
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,420
You stand out.

105
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:16,990
You wouldn't be as suspicious...

106
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:19,500
...if you acted natural instead
of being so secretive.

107
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,420
Why don't you just
chill out a bit

108
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,420
and have fun as a student?

109
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,910
Leave me alone.

110
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,280
And stay outta your way, right?

111
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:27,835
Hmm?

112
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:29,420
The two of us are going after

113
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,150
the same thing, here.

114
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:33,150
You can't hide it from me.

115
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,780
I can see it in your eyes

116
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,780
as plain as day, pal.

117
00:06:36,780 --> 00:06:38,060
What do you say the first one to

118
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,060
destroy that ship wins?

119
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:53,530
Hey, that's...

120
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:54,490
Relena...

121
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:57,100
I've found you, Heero.

122
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:06,760
Heero. I wanted to see you.

123
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,920
Well, she's not you're average
chick, wanting to

124
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,920
see the guy trying to kill her.

125
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,780
Hm...

126
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:17,130
Three mobile suit carriers,

127
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,480
seven escort planes
heading this way!

128
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:20,860
All OZ troops!

129
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:21,790
What's going on?!

130
00:07:21,790 --> 00:07:22,890
What are the OZ troops

131
00:07:22,890 --> 00:07:23,770
trying to pull here?!

132
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,280
The suits have been released!

133
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,400
Keep the assault centralized.

134
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,280
We just need to take over

135
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:33,210
the main facilities.

136
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,200
Following coup d'Ètat by OZ's

137
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,360
...the Earth Sphere
Alliance Military...

138
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,040
...enters a state of confusion.

139
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,040
Alliance Military
soldiers remain

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,950
confined in their
respective bases...

141
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:45,280
...without an understanding of

142
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,880
what in fact is happening.

143
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:49,980
The United Earth Sphere Alliance
was initially formed...

144
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,800
...to handle disputes
between the countries.

145
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:53,320
However, with its expansion in

146
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,970
military power, the Alliance...

147
00:07:54,970 --> 00:07:57,800
...soon took over governments
with militaristic control.

148
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:00,200
OZ was now planning to

149
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:01,230
free the many countries...

150
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:03,850
...that were forced into the
Alliance in this manner.

151
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,200
However, the increase in the

152
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,740
Alliance's military power...

153
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,910
...was a direct result of the

154
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:10,910
mobile suits provided by OZ.

155
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:12,600
As such, there were
many countries

156
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,600
that questioned OZ's
activities...

157
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,590
...noting that after
the coup d'Ètat,

158
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:20,670
military control would continue
and conditions would
remain the same.

159
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:23,600
Except now, ruler would be OZ.

160
00:08:33,290 --> 00:08:36,040
[OS:] All mobile suits have
left the carriers.

161
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:37,520
Then I'll leave as well.

162
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,080
I'll be backing you up.

163
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,080
Concentrate only on achieving

164
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:43,080
your mission, Lieutenant Zechs.

165
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:44,650
I'm totally focused, Noin.

166
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:46,650
We'll lure away
ground troops away,

167
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,240
but a few will probably be
flying toward you.

168
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:52,200
Don't worry, if our data's
right, I should

169
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,260
be able to outrun them.

170
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:55,230
Good luck!

171
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:04,410
The mobility of this heavy suit

172
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,410
depends on the vernier output.

173
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:08,570
It's going to be tough...

174
00:09:11,390 --> 00:09:12,190
This is going to take

175
00:09:12,190 --> 00:09:13,930
a lot of effort.

176
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,560
But I can't falter now with

177
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,450
the Sanc Kingdom right in
front of my eyes!

178
00:09:25,210 --> 00:09:26,540
Take over the runway on

179
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:27,470
the east side!

180
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:33,720
This speed is deadly!

181
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,380
I could get away by

182
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:39,870
increasing the output.

183
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,960
Then why?

184
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:42,960
Why am I hesitating?

185
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,960
Transmission from OZ, Sir!

186
00:09:44,960 --> 00:09:45,530
What?!

187
00:09:45,530 --> 00:09:46,890
Disarm your weapons

188
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:48,040
and surrender!

189
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,580
We have no wish to

190
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,880
continue this battle!

191
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,510
You're the ones that attacked,

192
00:09:52,510 --> 00:09:54,920
so you should be the ones
who are retreating!

193
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,840
Standby to fire laser canons!

194
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,480
Sir!

195
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:06,670
Headquarters didn't
mention those lasers!

196
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:08,920
Retreat!

197
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:21,520
Damned lasers!

198
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:23,880
Noin, order all
units to withdraw

199
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,050
from here at once.

200
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,850
I had no idea they had this
much firepower...

201
00:10:27,850 --> 00:10:29,440
...but we're still in the fight!

202
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,900
No.

203
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,900
We should leave the battle
for now and regroup.

204
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,840
Everyone withdraw to where

205
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:34,960
we landed the carriers.

206
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,010
Yes, sir!

207
00:10:39,390 --> 00:10:41,420
Why am I acting like
such a coward?

208
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,800
I could defeat them with
this Tallgeese.

209
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:46,670
I could ignore the lasers and
destroy their headquarters!

210
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,370
Lieutenant!

211
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,280
I've mastered
numerous mobile suits

212
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,490
in the past, so why? What
am I afraid of?!

213
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:06,840
I'll die if I keep going.

214
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:14,730
This mobile suit is capable of
defeating any enemy it faces!

215
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,730
But it does have one weak point;

216
00:11:16,730 --> 00:11:18,730
the pilot is a human being!

217
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,810
Is this the end?

218
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,120
Lady, won't you join me?

219
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:49,710
Mr. Treize, what would you
suggest for our next target?

220
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:55,400
Let's just continue
fighting and winning.

221
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,160
Shall I interprete that as
meaning we should conquer
the Earth Sphere?

222
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,180
That would be plenty.

223
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,180
OZ would then be hated.

224
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:04,380
It'd become a target

225
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,800
for the entire world.

226
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,200
What are you saying?

227
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:08,880
Those that are hated must

228
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,080
remain strong.

229
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:13,070
It'd be the perfect
motivation for OZ.

230
00:12:21,930 --> 00:12:24,400
Master Quatre, if anything were
to happen to you...

231
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,980
...how would we
possibly explain it...

232
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:28,170
to your father in the colonies?!

233
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,260
Don't you have confidence at
all in us, Master?

234
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:33,530
No, it's nothing like
that at all.

235
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:36,480
Our sole purpose is to
protect you, Sir.

236
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,380
Do you understand this?!

237
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:39,790
Master Quatre!!

238
00:12:39,790 --> 00:12:40,940
Y‐Yeah.

239
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,730
Right, that's enough.

240
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,990
But Captain Rashid, we're
just trying to...

241
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:47,850
Master Quatre has given us his
word that he won't leave on

242
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:49,200
his own any more.

243
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,200
Yeah, I promise.

244
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,200
Go on, there's no time

245
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:54,270
to stand around.

246
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:55,180
Load up the weapons on

247
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:56,680
your mobile suits or something.

248
00:12:58,410 --> 00:12:59,470
Thanks, Rashid.

249
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:03,360
I'm upset with you myself;

250
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
don't forget it.

251
00:13:04,640 --> 00:13:05,680
R‐Right.

252
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,130
So how was it?

253
00:13:07,580 --> 00:13:09,100
There were five suits in all.

254
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,270
I'm pretty sure they're all
called Gundams.

255
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,680
They're all Gundams?

256
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,680
They're violent and dangerous

257
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:17,680
but they're all
really nice guys.

258
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,090
How can you be sure of that,
Master?

259
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,140
I can tell.

260
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:24,110
The soul of outer space

261
00:13:24,110 --> 00:13:24,890
tells me.

262
00:13:25,450 --> 00:13:27,610
The soul of outer space...?

263
00:13:28,270 --> 00:13:30,220
The soul of outer space...

264
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:42,800
Gee, you two!

265
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,950
You call that fun,

266
00:13:43,950 --> 00:13:45,230
just sitting like that?

267
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,600
You haven't said a word
for two hours.

268
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:48,890
What do you want?

269
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,890
Nice greeting.

270
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:53,420
And here I thought I'd be doing
you a favor bringing this.

271
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:55,720
Eat it right up before
it gets cold.

272
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:00,270
I'll just leave it here

273
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:02,090
so you guys help yourselves.

274
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:04,090
And clean the dishes after
you're finished.

275
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:07,050
Gotta learn your manners while
you're still young, right?

276
00:14:07,070 --> 00:14:07,640
Bye!

277
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:13,900
I guess quiet people
attract quiet friends.

278
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,450
This might not be the best java.

279
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:28,170
I've got no right
piloting the Nataku.

280
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:30,970
Oh yeah?

281
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:35,080
Thank you.

282
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,970
You're recovering nicely from
a heart attack...

283
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,970
...but there are numerous
signs of irregularity

284
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,380
in the circulatory system.

285
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,960
You mean I should just be
glad to be alive.

286
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,480
Zechs, what in the
world happened?

287
00:14:59,020 --> 00:15:01,240
I really underestimated
the Tallgeese.

288
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:04,700
It completely ignores the
commands of the pilot.

289
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:06,400
It has an audacious design...

290
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,840
...that far exceeds today's

291
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:09,500
most advanced equipment.

292
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,500
It ignores the pilot?

293
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:13,500
It takes into consideration

294
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,150
all types of battle patterns...

295
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:19,240
...and makes it possible for the
one suit to achieve
victory on its own.

296
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,610
At least that's how I found it.

297
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,920
But I've become such a coward.

298
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:27,710
The more I try to utilize the
abilities of the
mobile suit's ...

299
00:15:27,710 --> 00:15:30,240
...the more I start doubting
my own abilities.

300
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:34,250
I start asking myself, "is that
all you're capable of doing?"

301
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,040
Rather than a suit for battle,

302
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,040
you could say it's a
suit for dueling.

303
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:42,490
It takes a brave pilot to bring
out its true potential.

304
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:45,880
A brave pilot?

305
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:48,320
Brave enough to risk
death for victory.

306
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,850
I still have a long way my own
fears are putting me in
the hospital.

307
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:56,830
Now, I've got to get back to
the Sanc Kingdom.

308
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,860
You rest! Any normal person
would've been dead by now.

309
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:05,070
I'm leaving, but you have to
stay here and get some rest.

310
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,730
But I have to go.

311
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:10,000
Okay, but not on the Tallgeese.

312
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,050
Noin!

313
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:13,900
The Tallgeese is
essential to victory.

314
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:17,310
I'm positive its design is the
same as the Gundams.

315
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,430
It is?

316
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:21,770
As I told you, I believe the
Gundams inherited...

317
00:16:21,770 --> 00:16:23,660
...the reckless design of
the Tallgeese.

318
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,550
The origin of all mobile suits.

319
00:16:25,550 --> 00:16:28,670
That's why it's crucial for me
to successfully pilot
the Tallgeese...

320
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:31,150
...in order to be able to
defeat the Gundams.

321
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:37,920
Tallgeese is for
suicide missions.

322
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:40,970
Now I understand what the
Gundams are up to.

323
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:44,570
They're searching for a place
suitable for their own deaths.

324
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:47,200
I know it's very difficult for
you to lie still...

325
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:51,150
...with the Sanc Kingdom close
by, but you must do as I say.

326
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,230
We'll attack tomorrow evening.

327
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:55,930
Sir! Tomorrow evening!

328
00:17:16,970 --> 00:17:18,080
What's the matter?!

329
00:17:18,080 --> 00:17:20,080
The Tallgeese has taken off!

330
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:21,210
By who?!

331
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:29,120
What's gotten into you, Otto?!
Return immediately!

332
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:31,500
This Tallgeese should be
able to take over...

333
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,500
...the headquarters of
the Sanc Kingdom!

334
00:17:34,010 --> 00:17:37,100
I should know; I
understand its strength!

335
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:39,240
Stop now! You'll die!

336
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:42,510
I'd be honored to sacrifice my
life for you, Zechs.

337
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:45,980
Please allow me to assist in
fulfilling your dreams, Sir!

338
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:50,200
I want to do this for your sake
Lieutenant Zechs and not for OZ!

339
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:51,770
Otto...

340
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:55,210
I will attain victory in
return for my life!

341
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:57,000
You're not making sense Otto!

342
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,580
Return at once! Otto!

343
00:18:04,410 --> 00:18:07,850
I've come all the way here just
to chase after a guy.

344
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:09,850
Are you surprised, Father?

345
00:18:09,850 --> 00:18:13,210
But I couldn't help myself; I
wanted to see him so badly.

346
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:16,480
Can you understand how I feel,
Father?

347
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:21,230
Heero's is the support I
need to have around

348
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:23,720
...until I can get over my
sadness over you.

349
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,720
But he keeps running
away from me...

350
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:33,640
Heero?!

351
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:48,220
All right! Looks like I
got here first!

352
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,010
What took you, Heero?!

353
00:18:58,010 --> 00:19:00,010
Don't worry, I left
you some action!

354
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,760
I can't see a thing!

355
00:19:22,570 --> 00:19:24,040
Mission complete.

356
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:36,720
Out of my way! I can't
withstand much more!

357
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,160
Hurry up!

358
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:47,980
Yes, sir!

359
00:19:47,980 --> 00:19:50,300
If only I'd been able to
pilot the Tallgeese...

360
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,760
...this would have
never happened!

361
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,320
The new type of mobile suit is
approaching fast!

362
00:19:57,160 --> 00:19:59,630
Direct all laser canons
at that suit!

363
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,710
LONG LIVE KING ZECHS!

364
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,000
Otto...

365
00:20:58,730 --> 00:21:02,320
It took me 13 years to return
to these grounds.

366
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:06,750
Father, forgive your son.

367
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,240
There's been much bloodshed
along the way...

368
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,150
...and I've only been able to
live a lifestyle...

369
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:15,310
...that counters your teachings
based on the principles of
total pacificm.

370
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,240
My hands are too
stained with blood.

371
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,760
I'm completely unfit to lead the
Peacecraft monarchy.

372
00:21:31,950 --> 00:21:34,600
But I'm sure she would be able
to lead the country...

373
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,600
...in the manner you'd intended.

374
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:38,860
I'll fight to make that happen.

375
00:21:39,150 --> 00:21:40,600
I've failed you.

376
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:42,090
Please forgive me.

377
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,400
I hear it was attacked!?

378
00:21:58,170 --> 00:21:59,530
Heero!

379
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,100
Hey, good looking!

380
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:02,730
Pretty nice day today, huh.

381
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,050
Well, gotta get to class.
I'll see you later.

382
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:12,480
Let me stay by you a
little longer.

383
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,660
I wanna be stronger,
just like you.

384
00:22:20,890 --> 00:22:23,660
[To be continued]

[MUSIC]

386
00:23:38,540 --> 00:23:42,140
[Narrator:] Battles that risk
lives only produce mistakes...

387
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,830
...then what meaning does
Otto's death have?

388
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:50,393
Lady Une announces a plan to
transport Taurus, the space
mobile suit,

389
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:51,740
to the
Siberian Base.

390
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,770
However, this is in fact a
pretense to wipe out
the Gundams.

391
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:59,450
In his battle with Zechs, Heero
makes a final decision.

392
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:02,440
Next on Gundam Wing Episode 10:

393
