To facilitate it's reign over the
world,

3
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:30,841
Romefeller foundation promoted a
new Oz.

4
00:01:31,008 --> 00:01:34,048
With it's main power consisting of
unmanned units

5
00:01:34,216 --> 00:01:35,471
called mobile
dolls.

6
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,993
Certain changes within the
Foundation

7
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:40,726
followed Treize Khushenrada's
retaliation,

8
00:01:40,893 --> 00:01:43,186
including his being
stripped of all power.

9
00:01:43,436 --> 00:01:44,551
At the same time,

10
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,233
the Foundation was rapidly
expanding its area of rule,

11
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:51,853
thanks to the highly skilled
mobile dolls.

12
00:01:52,021 --> 00:01:54,323
The year is After Colony 195.

13
00:01:54,698 --> 00:01:57,451
After the space colonies
accepted the Foundation,

14
00:01:57,618 --> 00:02:01,748
execution orders were released for
the now isolated Gundam pilots.

15
00:02:01,915 --> 00:02:05,876
For them it looked like the future
would take a turn for the worse.

16
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:11,758
Armed suits that shouldn't
be found in a pacifist nation.

17
00:02:11,925 --> 00:02:14,260
Does the princess know
about these units?

18
00:02:15,261 --> 00:02:17,186
People think about fighting
because

19
00:02:17,355 --> 00:02:19,223
they possess weapons such as
these.

20
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:23,185
In order to cling to peace which
is really as fragile as glass.

00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:39,066
No. But I'd sure hate to be
involved in

36
00:03:39,235 --> 00:03:41,721
an accident in an isolated place
like this.

00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:43,891
Huh? What is that?

38
00:03:45,476 --> 00:03:46,560
<i>[RITTER:] Is it a mine?</i>

The pieces are scattered all over.

43
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,493
It must have exploded. Hmm?

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:05,663
What's the matter, did you
find something?

Built with the plentiful
resources on the moon,

61
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:38,385
the Virgo mobile dolls were
directed at Earth,

62
00:05:38,553 --> 00:05:40,090
to suppress rebel
forces.

The plan appeared to be
progressing smoothly.

64

But recently,
frequent disturbances

65
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,058
had hindered output on
the Virgo production line.

66
00:05:49,266 --> 00:05:52,520
They´re disappeared? But
what about the escort troops!?

00:05:52,686 --> 00:05:55,231
They have vanished, with
the carrier fleet.

They've been destroyed!

and is headed to the
location sir.

Ten Tauruses, fifty space mines,
one support carrier...

What’s this?

76
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:21,506
Trant is the only soldier?
Contact Trant!

77
00:06:21,673 --> 00:06:24,760
But sir he's out on a search,
so we shouldn't contact him

on the line! Sir!

Following my examination of the
new Gundam's cockpit system,

00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:44,530

<i>[TRANT:] The cockpit is equipped</i>
<i>with a system that</i>

<i>increases the combative</i>
<i>abilities of the pilot!</i>

87
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:29,950
[TRANT:] It can fully match the
reaction time of the mobile dolls.

88
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,613
But as soon as brainwave levels
are increased during combat,

00:07:34,781 --> 00:07:35,873
a problem
arises.

Nope! It's all under control.

Sure thing. Later!

00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,385
[TRANT:] I'll go to the area where

00:12:08,553 --> 00:12:10,313
a number of the carriers have
disappeared

140
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,483
and give it a thorough search.

[HILDE:] Duo!

142
00:12:31,668 --> 00:12:33,211
[DUO:] Any success?

00:12:33,795 --> 00:12:34,726
Uh‐huh! No luck.

144
00:12:34,895 --> 00:12:38,216
I couldn't get any information
on the new transport plan!

145
00:12:38,425 --> 00:12:39,838
[DUO:] Oz isn't that ignorant!

146
00:12:40,006 --> 00:12:42,095
They're just being more
cautious than before.

00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,501
I'd love to destroy barge right
now.

148
00:12:44,670 --> 00:12:47,100
But I'll have to put it off for a
while.

149
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:49,895
Are you gonna keep on
fighting alone Duo?

150
00:12:50,145 --> 00:12:51,850
[DUO:] What choice do I have?

151
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:54,096
I have no idea where
the others are.

152
00:12:54,265 --> 00:12:56,110
So I'll just have
to go it alone.

153
00:12:56,735 --> 00:12:59,625
Let me know if there's any way I
can be of help Duo.

154
00:12:59,793 --> 00:13:00,738
I'll do anything!

155
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:05,326
Okay! I wouldn't mind having
a juicy steak for dinner!

156
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,871
Come off it! I'm totally serious!

157
00:13:08,038 --> 00:13:12,333
[DUO:] I know I know. You're
doing more than enough already!

158
00:13:12,751 --> 00:13:13,418
[BOTH:] Huh??

159
00:13:13,585 --> 00:13:15,586
[HILDE:] What is that??

160
00:13:18,965 --> 00:13:20,216
Wait a sec!

161
00:13:20,425 --> 00:13:22,218
[DUO:] It's a Gundam!

162
00:13:27,390 --> 00:13:28,766
<i>[TRANT:] Freeze.</i>

163
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:41,871
[TRANT:] Duo Maxwell, I demand
that you come with me.

164
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,531
Do it or you're
dead.

165
00:13:45,868 --> 00:13:47,608
Hey, do what you got to do,

166
00:13:47,776 --> 00:13:50,663
but remember the power of
that beam cannon.

167
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:53,625
You could completely
demolish this colony.

168
00:13:53,791 --> 00:13:55,133
[TRANT:] I don't care.

169
00:13:55,301 --> 00:13:58,505
I have no interest
in what happens to this place kid.

170
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:00,923
I've got no intention of remaining

171
00:14:01,091 --> 00:14:03,343
an insignificant technical
officer.

172
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:05,958
Once I figure out this Gundam's
system,

173
00:14:06,126 --> 00:14:08,223
Colonel Tuberov's mobile dolls
will

174
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,278
be a useless tool of the past.

175
00:14:10,446 --> 00:14:13,478
What the new Oz needs is a
completely new system.

176
00:14:13,645 --> 00:14:16,981
I'll do whatever is required
to make that happen.

177
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:24,071
Now come here Gundam pilot,
you're the only one I want.

178
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:43,448
What's with all this junk you've
attached?

179
00:14:43,616 --> 00:14:45,760
Alright, what do you want me to
do?

180
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:49,933
I want you to fight the mobile
dolls with the Wing Zero here.

181
00:14:50,101 --> 00:14:51,891
With real firearms
of course.

182
00:14:52,058 --> 00:14:55,980
That's fine with me but I just
might escape during your tests.

183
00:14:56,396 --> 00:14:59,905
[TRANT:] No you won't. I've set it
so the Wing's functions

184
00:15:00,073 --> 00:15:01,693
can be stopped from
outside.

185
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,445
And besides, I've programmed the
mobile dolls

186
00:15:04,613 --> 00:15:06,781
to switch their target to
that colony

187
00:15:06,948 --> 00:15:09,493
in case you decide to try
something funny.

188
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,586
[TRANT:] Right! Commence!

189
00:15:23,173 --> 00:15:26,510
<i>[DUO:] If I use the rifle from</i>
<i>this position</i>

190
00:15:26,678 --> 00:15:30,471
<i>it would harm the colony.</i>
<i>So I'll use this instead!</i>

191
00:15:34,643 --> 00:15:37,870
[TRANT:] That's good, that's the
way to fight.

192
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,773
Show me exactly what you see
before you.

193
00:15:46,821 --> 00:15:48,365
Huh?? What's this?

194
00:15:52,076 --> 00:15:53,786
What? No way!

195
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,788
<i>[TRANT:] So you saw it?</i>

196
00:15:56,790 --> 00:15:57,928
You must tell me,

197
00:15:58,096 --> 00:16:01,545
just what is the Wing Zero
trying to show the pilot?

198
00:16:01,878 --> 00:16:03,921
<i>How should I know what it means??</i>

199
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,676
I see, that's my enemy.

200
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:24,193
Ahhhh!

201
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,860
[TRANT:] What now??

[HILDE:] AHHHHH!!

00:17:26,421 --> 00:17:28,305
[DUO:] What am I doing?

208
00:17:28,473 --> 00:17:31,260
What in the hell have I been
doing?

[EXPLOSION]

210
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:53,490
No. No way. Huh?

211
00:17:59,996 --> 00:18:05,001
It couldn't be. There's no way.
How could a person do this?

212
00:18:05,168 --> 00:18:06,336
[TRANT:] It's possible.

213
00:18:07,336 --> 00:18:08,796
Believe me it is.

214
00:18:09,296 --> 00:18:12,753
[TRANT:] We can do anything with
this outstanding system.

215
00:18:12,921 --> 00:18:14,303
It's capable
of altering

00:18:14,470 --> 00:18:18,890
human consciousness.
Anything is possible with this.

I'll do it. I'm gonna go for it.

223
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:50,255
You better leave it alone.
Just forget that system.

224

[TUBAROV:] Destroy him!

He's a dead man.

Just a little more, I can't
see everything yet.

231

[TRANT:] Come on, give me

Don't worry Hilde! Remember,
I'm a Gundam pilot!

234
00:19:40,763 --> 00:19:44,293
[DUO:] That system is more than a
human can handle.

235
00:19:44,461 --> 00:19:45,560
I gotta stop
him.

236

It's expanding, my consciousness
is expanding!

I can almost see
everything!

I'm almost there!

Damn! It's incredibly fast!

What??

00:21:12,563 --> 00:21:14,398
It might just be a tie!

<i>[TRANT:] Get away from me!</i>

I won't be defeated and certainly
not by a young punk like you!

258
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:30,651
If you were to lose it wouldn't be
to me!

259
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:32,625
You'd be losing to the Wing Zero!

<i>do you!?</i>

[TRANT:] AAHHHHH!!!

263
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:51,455
I won't lose! I can't possibly
lose!

264
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:56,023
I can handle
a system like this no prob‐AGHH!!

265
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:09,536
It's just too much for a
human being to handle.

266
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:14,345
[DUO:] If anyone were capable of
it,

00:22:14,513 --> 00:22:18,130
he'd be superior to
the entire human race.
