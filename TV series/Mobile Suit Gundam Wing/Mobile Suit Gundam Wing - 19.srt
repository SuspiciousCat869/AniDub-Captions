the Romefeller Foundation

00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,960
so set on using
mobile suits anyway?

39
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:40,860
Because people have a tendency
to fear large machinery.

40
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:43,780
But at the same time they
have a strong admiration for it.

There's no formality

00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,870
If there were, it would be

was being held on
the outskirts of Bremen.

The Romefeller Foundation was
formed from European royalty.

With their enormous
financial power

and personal connections

their energy

into the development
of weaponry.

On the other side of that door

the Sanc Kingdom.

has requested considerable funds

And we had no reservations

cooperating with them
to achieve world peace.

79
00:05:21,980 --> 00:05:24,710
[DERMAIL:] However, the
Alliance started seeking

80
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,360
peace through dialogue alone.

00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,233

82
00:05:28,401 --> 00:05:30,520
cannot be settled
through dialogue.

00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:34,280
Isn't a system of control what
humanity truly needs?

84
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:38,140
And that is precisely how
control will be exercised now.

85
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:41,100
This is the way that peace
can be maintained.

86
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,640
The Alliance lacked the
necessary talent.

87
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,860
Many responsibilities
are required to rule.

88
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,000
But they attempted to run away
from those responsibilities.

89
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,300
The people here have traditions
with which to rule an era.

90
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,283
The world was corrupted
by such imperfect ideas

91
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:58,000
as equality and freedom.

92
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,020
And now the time has arrived

93
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:02,780
where we must once
again take control.

[CROWD APPROVES]

95
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,748
I can't believe that OZ is using
these methods

96
00:06:08,916 --> 00:06:10,160
to take over the world.

97
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,970
The Romefeller Foundation
kept such ideas as these

98
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:15,530
behind closed doors while
hiding its presence

99
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:17,640
and true agendas
within the Alliance.

100
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,170
OZ took advantage of
the situation, saying

101
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,358
“If the Alliance is unable
to achieve world peace,

102
00:06:23,526 --> 00:06:24,340
then we will.”

103
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:26,660
So the war will
continue, will it?

104
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:27,720
OZ has to keep winning

105
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:30,440
if they’re gonna make a
case for their policy to rule.

106
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,300
The rewards of victory and
OZ's success go hand in hand.

107
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,130
The collapse of the past
system was a revolution

108
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:39,560
against the kind of bad rule
that created poverty.

109
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,606
So, in order to continue
its rule,

110
00:06:42,775 --> 00:06:45,620
OZ must continue to
win its battles.

111
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:48,490
And that’s why OZ must
have the strongest

112
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,960
mobile suit troops
in order to exist.

113
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,300
But the Gundams can defeat OZ.

114
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:57,540
OZ sees the Gundams as nothing
more than a simple menace.

115
00:06:57,540 --> 00:07:00,270
By threatening to directly
attack the colonies.

116
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:03,360
OZ was successful in completely
silenced the Gundams.

The word “rule'' is

with oppression and

she's the younger sister
of a friend I invited.

161
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:26,000
What on Earth was
she trying to get at?

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,420
She must've sensed ou
anxiety toward the Gundams.

163
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:32,540
She's saying “be confident.”

164
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,430
[DERMAIL:] Speaking
of the Gundams,

165
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,540
I want to talk to you
about Zechs Merquise.

166
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,251
I think you're giving him
too much freedom.

167
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:36,140
Meaning what?

168
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,410
I heard a rumor

169
00:09:37,410 --> 00:09:41,520
that he's reconstructing the
self‐detonated Gundam.

170
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:44,190
[OTHER GUY:] It's
insane to be fixing

171
00:09:44,190 --> 00:09:47,300
a mobile suit that we’ve always
thought of as such a menace!

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,190
[OTHER GUY #2:] That Gundam

173
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:51,421
should be completely destroyed
to serve as a warning

174
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:52,440
to all the colonies!

175
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,110
I understand what you're saying,

176
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,380
and if thats what the
Foundation agrees on,

177
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,730
I'll contact Colonel Zechs

178
00:09:57,898 --> 00:10:00,100
and tell him
to destroy the Gundam at once.

179
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,305
[ZECHS:] I’m surprised that
rumors about the Gundam

180
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:09,380
were so widespread.

181
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,801
[NOIN:] It just shows the
significance of the damage

182
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:14,080
they've rendered to OZ.

183
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:17,580
His Excellency didn't seem in
favor of the decision, though.

184
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,880
Can't help it, if they're
orders from above.

185
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,990
[NOIN:] Tell me, Zechs, will

186
00:10:21,990 --> 00:10:24,080
you follow their orders
to destroy the Gundam?

187
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,180
[ZECHS:] How's Relena doing?

188
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:29,360
[NOIN:] She's a ball of energy.

189
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,980
It's not easy to escort her.

190
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,720
[ZECHS:] How much does she know?

191
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,500
[NOIN:] It seems that Mr.
Darlian, her foster father.

192
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,760
told her quite a lot
before he passed away.

193
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:41,000
I’ve told her you're a respect‐
able and trustworthy soldier

194
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:43,120
who was brought up in
the Sanc Kingdom.

195
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:44,940
I also mentioned to her

196
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,031
that you were the
only one present

197
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,100
when Gundam 01 self‐detonated.

198
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,940
And that you're reconstructing
that Gundam.

199
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,936
Which has lead
Relena to believe that

200
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:56,100
the pilot of the Gundam,
Heero Yuy,

201
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,520
must've somehow made
it out of there alive.

202
00:10:58,520 --> 00:11:01,980
Heero Yuy... so that's
the name of that pilot.

203
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,120
[NOIN:] Relena appears to
have a connection with him,

204
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,120
much like yourself.

205
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:07,380
I understand.

206
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:09,780
Thanks for keeping
me informed, Noin.

207
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,850
[NOIN:] You’re not going to tell
her about yourself, Zechs?

208
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,600
Over and out.

209
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:18,060
How could I do that?

210
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,150
After all, I’m Zechs Merquise,

211
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,880
part of the organization
responsible for this blood bath.

212
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,160
[HEAVY RAIN]

213
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,080
I could set fire to this castle
and burn it down this minute.

214
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:37,780
But God would never forgive me
if I did such a thing, though.

215
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,410
[KHUSHRENADA:] Perhaps I'll
be punished as a criminal

216
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,780
for my profanity toward God.

217
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,000
In which case, an appropriate
punishment must be planned.

218
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
God's merely an imaginary figure
created by humans.

219
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,150
[NARRATOR:] Marshal Noventa
of the Earth Sphere Alliance

220
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:11,840
announced his objection
to the expansion of armaments,

221
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:15,240
which were supposed to be
only a deterrent to rebellions.

222
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:19,180
He passed a request for arms
reduction and disarmament.

223
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,000
The request was never realized,
because of his untimely death.

224
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:26,440
However, OZ chose that day
as the dawn of a new era

225
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:29,135
and lured the Gundams into
shooting down

226
00:12:29,303 --> 00:12:31,320
a shuttle that carried Noventa.

227
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,600
[NOVENTA:] I won't let it
obstruct our peace proposal.

228
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,280
[SCARED SOLDIER:] M...Marshal!

229
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:45,320
Now, young man...
don’t be foolish!

230
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,230
As a result of this tragedy

231
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,360
the road to peace in the world
may have been lost forever.

232
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:02,320
[CAPTAIN:] Sylvia! You must
escape from the city at once!

233
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,480
[SYLVIA:] I appreciate your
concern about me, Captain.

234
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:08,610
[CAPTAIN:] Many soldiers from
the United Earth Sphere Alliance

235
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:10,580
are still stationed
here in Marseilles.

236
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:13,030
OZ is likely to follow
through with their plans

237
00:13:13,198 --> 00:13:15,280
to attack those of us
who are still here.

238
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,600
[CAPTAIN:] Up until now,

239
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,418
I thought that the city
could be protected

240
00:13:20,586 --> 00:13:22,140
because the Alliance
has a base here.

241
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,540
But now the base poses the
greatest threat to the city.

242
00:13:25,540 --> 00:13:27,540
It'll be a battleground.

243
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:29,660
[SYLVIA:] Yes, I know.

244
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:32,080
It’s just that it’s taken me
longer than I thought

245
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,073
to leave behind memories

246
00:13:33,241 --> 00:13:34,820
of my life here
with my grandfather.

247
00:13:35,060 --> 00:13:37,780
Marshal Noventa
was a very fine person.

248
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,780
He always thinking

249
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:41,680
about how he could help
to achieve true world peace.

250
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:44,053
My grandfather's no longer here,

251
00:13:44,221 --> 00:13:46,240
but his heart
will always remain.

252
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:49,820
I'll live my life remembering
that he's here in our hearts.

253
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:50,860
Oh, Sylvia.

254
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,120
I'm sorry.

we're under enemy attack!

Is it OZ?

[SOLDIER:] Yes!
We’ve confirmed ten Aries suits!

259
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,795
So they think they can
capture this place

00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:04,780
with ten mobile suits
alone, do they?

What’ll we do now?

00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,200
Don't worry, Sylvia.
We won't give up that easily.

The Alliance's Leos

That’s a pretty
obvious decision.

we have a Gundam in town.

00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,500
in a battle between
the Alliance and OZ.

314
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:51,500
However, I just can't afford to
have anyone see my Gundam suit.

315
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,800
[ALLIANCE CAPTAIN:] Five Aries
suits have been wiped out!

316
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,880
Is this a miracle?

317
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:01,440
Who could this
unidentified mobile suit be?

318
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:04,880
Whoever it is,
I'm extremely grateful to them.

319
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:11,940
[SYLVIA:] Heero?

320
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:14,680
You said your name
was Heero Yuy?

321
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:21,280
Heero Yuy, huh.

322
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:24,020
This is my grandfather's
grave, right here.

323
00:18:24,620 --> 00:18:26,900
You said you wanted
to talk to me?

324
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,980
[GASPS]

325
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:34,520
I was the one who
killed Marshal Noventa.

326
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:35,240
Huh?

327
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,750
I made a critical mistake and
accidentally shot down

328
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,100
the shuttle that
Marshal Noventa was on.

329
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,760
Killing him and other people

330
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,720
who'd also been
advocating peace.

331
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:51,020
How could you? What happened?

332
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,948
This is the only thing I can do
for

333
00:18:54,116 --> 00:18:56,560
you right now, Sylvia Noventa.

334
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:02,980
I can't undo my mistake.

335
00:19:03,240 --> 00:19:06,960
I hope the anger felt by the
Marshal's loved ones and

336
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,790
the regrets of the
Marshal's soul

337
00:19:08,790 --> 00:19:10,840
can be somewhat eased
if you pull that trigger.

338
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,360
You're such a coward!

339
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,680
It’s obvious that you wanna take
the easy way out of this!

340
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,720
This is the only answer
I can offer you right now.

341
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,260
[SYLVIA:] You coward!

342
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,720
You coward!

343
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,140
Try to understand,

344
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:31,220
I didn't come here to make you
suffer any more than you have.

345
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,320
I'm leaving now to go pay a
visit to your grandmother.

346
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:37,720
I heard she's living
over in Sicily.

347
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:39,980
What?

348
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,940
[TROWA:] This is
where it starts.

349
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,160
He goes from one
family member to the next,

350
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,300
seeking their verdict.

351
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:47,430
Everything this guy does

352
00:19:47,430 --> 00:19:50,000
is completely thorough
and well thought out.

353
00:19:50,260 --> 00:19:52,480
Everything Heero Yuy does.

354
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,000
Wars are nothing
but repulsive killings!

355
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:58,520
So how is it you can be
so clear‐cut about it all?

356
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:02,440
It's the only way
I know how to live.

357
00:20:16,460 --> 00:20:17,220
Do it.

358
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:22,740
[EXPLOSIONS]

359
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:30,235
Gundam 01 has been destroyed

360
00:20:30,403 --> 00:20:32,500
as per the orders,
Inspector Acht.

361
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,240
[ACHT:] I did see the explosion.

362
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,240
But would you have any objection
to my collecting the remains?

363
00:20:37,240 --> 00:20:40,740
You're not satisfied with the
docs we submitted, Inspector?

364
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:44,380
I'd rather confirm the remains
with my own two eyes.

365
00:20:44,380 --> 00:20:47,130
And I’ll have to prepare
a document of my own

366
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:50,940
to satisfy the hard‐liners of
the Romefeller Foundation.

367
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,100
Feel free.

368
00:20:56,040 --> 00:20:59,020
I don't imagine we'll find
anything out of the ordinary.

369
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:02,796
That man isn't likely to be
careless with details,

370
00:21:02,965 --> 00:21:03,940
Zechs Merquise.

371
00:21:03,940 --> 00:21:05,926
There weren't any
Gundam parts left

372
00:21:06,095 --> 00:21:08,140
at the Lake Victoria base,
Inspector.

373
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:11,880
That man is fond of
the mobile suits.

374
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,910
I can't see him bending his ways

375
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:16,580
because of a request
from the likes of us.

376
00:21:16,580 --> 00:21:20,020
What will he gain by opposing
the Romefeller Foundation?

377
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,480
I haven’t got a clue to
what he's thinking.

378
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:26,220
But Romefeller's is starting
to take over this era.

379
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:29,410
All we have to do now to
move into the top ranks

380
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:32,680
is prove that Zechs betrayed
his official orders.

381
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:35,510
[MISER:] The Inspector is just
trying to find faults with you

382
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:38,260
so he can score some points
with the Romefeller Foundation.

383
00:21:38,860 --> 00:21:40,830
He's not gonna find
anything that differs

384
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:42,620
from what the documents
show, though.

385
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,480
I’m sorry I had to involve you
in this performance of mine.

386
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:50,190
I figured it'd be a real waste
to just destroy the Gundam 01

387
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:51,800
at this point in the game.

388
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:54,080
But the bad news is
that we've destroyed

389
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:56,940
most of the spare parts
to the Tallgeese, Colonel.

390
00:21:56,940 --> 00:22:00,160
In that case I'll just have to
be more careful with it.

391
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:03,380
No pilot is capable of
harming either the Tallgeese

392
00:22:03,548 --> 00:22:05,180
or yourself, Colonel Zechs.

393
00:22:05,180 --> 00:22:08,380
Not true: there is
at least one man.

394
00:22:27,080 --> 00:22:36,180
[CLOSING MUSIC]

395
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,440
[NARRATOR:] A war is
supposed to be heartless.

396
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,040
But Heero places his own destiny
in the hands of Mrs. Noventa.

397
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:47,580
Meanwhile, Zechs longs for
a decisive battle as a warrior.

398
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:51,040
Noin invites Heero to
Antarctica where Zechs awaits.

399
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,920
Inspector Acht pursues them
with his own forces.

400
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,601
The revival of the Gundam
is about to ignite

401
00:23:56,770 --> 00:23:58,100
a new blaze of its own.

402
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,060
Next, on Gundam Wing

403
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:06,180
Episode 15: To the
Battleground, Antarctica.
