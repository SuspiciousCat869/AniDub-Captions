[GUNDAM WING]

3
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:33,316
[NARRATOR] By having Relena
Peacecraft join the
Romefeller Foundation as

4
00:01:33,316 --> 00:01:38,116
their representative and a
symbol of peace they are
able to gain the

5
00:01:38,116 --> 00:01:43,006
support of the people and are
justified in making the World
Nation a reality.

6
00:01:48,026 --> 00:01:53,316
Meanwhile in outer space, an
uprising. An armed
organization called White Fang

7
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:58,336
directs all forces to fight for
the independence of
the colonies.

8
00:01:58,336 --> 00:02:02,116
The White Fang organization
welcomed its new leader.

9
00:02:02,116 --> 00:02:06,386
[ZECHS] Earth and space. The
two exist together

10
00:02:06,386 --> 00:02:11,496
and form a pattern of
confrontation.

11
00:02:11,496 --> 00:02:17,006
My name is Milliardo Peacecraft.
I declare that we will
eliminate the Earth,

12
00:02:17,006 --> 00:02:20,736
the force that
conflicts with space.

13
00:02:22,696 --> 00:02:27,586
[HEERO] Zechs you've chosen
one of the futures

00:02:27,586 --> 00:02:30,386
Epyon showed you.

15
00:02:30,386 --> 00:02:35,756
Well out of the futures that
Wing Zero showed me I've
chosen this one...

16
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:41,276
[HEERO] Crossfire at Barge.

17
00:02:41,356 --> 00:02:45,716
Enemy dolls have crossed the
space minefield. ETA
to defense line

18
00:02:45,716 --> 00:02:48,076
is two minutes.

19
00:02:48,076 --> 00:02:51,776
[MAN] Our Taurus mobile doll
troops will take their
defense formation.

20
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:54,476
[SOLDIER] They'll be fully
deployed in t‐minus 30.

21
00:02:54,476 --> 00:02:56,876
[COMMANDER] Isn't the Barge
cannon ready yet?

22
00:02:56,876 --> 00:03:00,586
[SOLDIER] Connections are
complete. We'll bring
in the workers.

23
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:03,406
[COMMANDER] Increase energy
level on the double!

24
00:03:03,406 --> 00:03:06,646
[MAN 2] Yes sir! All units
assume phase 3 battle positions!

25
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:09,986
Send out every Taurus suit and
don't let the enemy
get near Barge.

26
00:03:09,986 --> 00:03:13,586
This is our last fortress in
space and we can't afford
to lose it now.

27
00:03:13,586 --> 00:03:17,226
[MAN 2] The laser beams won't
work against the Virgos.

28
00:03:17,226 --> 00:03:20,786
Arm the Taurus suits with
laser cannons!

29
00:03:20,786 --> 00:03:24,826
[MAN] They're not programmed for
the additional output. They'd
overheat in no time!

30
00:03:24,826 --> 00:03:29,096
[MAN 2] Doesn't matter! As long
as they wipe out some
of the dolls!

31
00:03:29,096 --> 00:03:34,386
[SOLDIER] The enemy mobile dolls
will reach our first
defense line in

[SOLDIER] 10... 9... 8... 7...

[SOLDIER] One! The battle has
begun! [DRAMATIC MUSIC]

34
00:03:51,876 --> 00:03:56,876
[NARRATOR] The White Fang
initiated a battle with the
space fortress Barge.

35
00:03:56,876 --> 00:04:01,876
It was obvious to everyone that
the winner would claim

36
00:04:01,876 --> 00:04:06,576
supremacy through outer space.
For this reason both the Oz

37
00:04:06,576 --> 00:04:11,376
space forces and the White Fang
fought an extremely fierce

38
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:15,876
Battle employing
their full forces.

39
00:04:19,956 --> 00:04:23,876
Mobile doll unit five moving
to the left wing.

40
00:04:23,876 --> 00:04:28,076
35% have crossed the
enemy defense line.

41
00:04:28,076 --> 00:04:31,176
That's the way! Now keep on
applying pressure!

42
00:04:31,176 --> 00:04:35,876
There's something approaching
us from behind, sir.

43
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:39,809
[SEDICI] What?! That's the
Epyon! It's Commander Milliardo!

44
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:44,564
Wait Commander Milliardo. What
are you doing in your
mobile suit?

45
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:48,516
You're the chief commander of
the White Fang aren't you?
Just give

46
00:04:48,516 --> 00:04:52,164
out the orders and leave the
fighting to the mobile dolls.

47
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:55,142
[ZECHS] You do just that.

48
00:04:56,116 --> 00:05:01,376
Commander Milliardo still thinks
of himself as the
lightning count.

49
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:14,876
Hang on a second
please Miss Noin.

50
00:05:14,876 --> 00:05:18,876
I know you don't want me to do
this but I really have to
meet with Zechs

51
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:22,876
and talk to him in person. I am
positive he has to have

52
00:05:22,876 --> 00:05:27,876
a good reason. He must be
rebelling for the Sanc
Kingdom and Miss Relena.

53
00:05:27,876 --> 00:05:32,609
Still it's too dangerous to
approach Barge alone.
Sandrock's been completely

54
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:35,942
repaired. I'll go with you.

55

Quatre...

56
00:05:38,336 --> 00:05:41,854
[DUO] There's lots of civilian
colonies around Barge!

57
00:05:41,854 --> 00:05:45,846
Shouldn't be too hard to
approach the fortress unnoticed!

58
00:05:45,846 --> 00:05:48,846
[NOIN] Duo! [QUATRE] Will
you come with us?

59
00:05:48,846 --> 00:05:52,476
I wanna let Oz and the guys at
White Fang know the God of Death

60
00:05:52,476 --> 00:05:54,646
is back and he's come
with a bang!

61
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,964
Thanks a lot Duo.

62
00:05:56,964 --> 00:05:59,587
Catch all that?

63
00:05:59,587 --> 00:06:02,876
Well at the very least I guess I
could cover for you guys.

came back here.

here on time.

Don't go firing on me I've got
something important to give you.

It was a pain finding it so I
want to make sure you get it.

Does this mean you found
out where Trowa is?

No but I think that the Gundams
are essential to our
present era.

That's why I want to do whatever
I can to help you guys.

yourself is so lonely.
I'm sure you don't

80
00:07:58,476 --> 00:08:03,516
like getting sympathy but won't
you let me help you
out a little?

I don't see anyone. Ah!

86
00:08:20,964 --> 00:08:25,076
He seems kinda different this
time. He used to have
such an abrasive

87
00:08:25,076 --> 00:08:29,076
personality. He was so
hard to approach.

up that Gundam!

it is him alright.

What does Queen Relena plan to
do about it? Now that
Duke Dermail's been

00:09:14,046 --> 00:09:19,046
killed Miss Relena's the only
one who could hope to control
the new Romefeller.

What could you be
thinking Milliardo?

Well regardless of what you have
up your sleeve dear brother...

103
00:10:13,046 --> 00:10:18,024
fighting isn't the solution. And
it's my responsibility

and my duty to make you stop.

Long time no see, Miss Relena.

It's you Treize Khushrenada.
Why are you here?

109
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,996
[TREIZE] I thought I'd inform
you of a decision made
by Romefeller's

110
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:04,601
top executives.

[RELENA] I don't know what
you're talking about.

112
00:11:07,306 --> 00:11:11,706
As of this day you're to be
dismissed of your duties
as representative

113
00:11:11,706 --> 00:11:15,934
of the Romefeller Foundation. I
must therefore ask you to
resign from your

position as queen.

115
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:28,066
I understand you. I will give up
my rights as the representative.

last thing that I have to do
before I resign.

117
00:11:32,686 --> 00:11:37,876
I must convince my brother
Milliardo to stop fighting
against the Earth.

118
00:11:38,424 --> 00:11:41,846
[TREIZE] You're not
capable of doing that.

119
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:44,246
What's that supposed to mean?

120
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:49,126
[TREIZE] It's a crime to confine
you within this

Romefeller's chief

I'll personally lead the battle

You're free. Free to go wherever
you please. [DRAMATIC MUSIC]

have to get a space

can't afford to let the

130
00:13:41,905 --> 00:13:46,572
closer to us than this. Prepare
to fire the Barge cannon now!

is only at 80% capacity!

enough to fire.

133
00:13:55,372 --> 00:13:59,772
[SEDICI] OK move units 8 to 24
to the left. The remaining
units will continue

central units to Commander
Milliardo &amp; the Epyon.

That's right the Gundam is our
organization's symbol.

136
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:14,927
and it's combat abilities are
much greater than those of
the mobile dolls.

the Earth is finally moving
toward pacificism.
