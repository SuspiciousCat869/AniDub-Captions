[VOICE] Treize Khushrenada
assumes the position as the
World Nation's sovereign

4
00:01:31,337 --> 00:01:37,007
and once again accumulates all
military armaments on land. In
space the White Fang

5
00:01:37,007 --> 00:01:43,207
completes its gigantic space
battleship Libra. With his
desire to eliminate Earth

6
00:01:43,207 --> 00:01:49,207
commander Milliardo Peacecraft
proceeds with his plans
to enter into a

7
00:01:49,207 --> 00:01:55,207

entire forces of the World

be experienced by humanity
is about to begin.

Milliardo's Decision

00:03:01,287 --> 00:03:06,937
[NARRATOR] Having been attacked
by the enormous battleship
Libra the Earth

20
00:03:06,937 --> 00:03:12,667
compiled an overwhelming amount
of resources to stage a
counterattack.

21
00:03:12,667 --> 00:03:18,717
The Earth used the closest
natural resource satellite,
the M‐02,

22
00:03:18,717 --> 00:03:24,487
to gather thousands of armored
mobile suit troops, consisting
primarily of space

23
00:03:24,487 --> 00:03:30,717
Leos. Treize declared that he
would lead the attack and the
soldiers confidently

24
00:03:30,717 --> 00:03:36,317
followed him with high spirits.
However some were
skeptical as to the odds

25
00:03:36,317 --> 00:03:41,317
they had against the
enormous battleship.

really think it's too
dangerous for you

to give orders from the front.

28
00:03:56,487 --> 00:04:00,627
Milliardo Peacecraft the
commander of the White
Fang is fighting

29
00:04:00,627 --> 00:04:05,057
at the front line. Just think of
this as an act of
civility toward him.

30
00:04:05,057 --> 00:04:06,807
[SOLDIER] But sir!

31
00:04:06,807 --> 00:04:13,267
Remember this for the future: A
war with no civility only gives
rise to massacres.

32
00:04:13,267 --> 00:04:19,757
[TREIZE] That's why the wars
that occurred on Earth in the
past were so tragic.

Yeah but what an
impressive suit it is.

If his excellency has already
left for space then
there's no need to

leave it half done.

anyone left on Earth who's
capable of piloting this suit.

world has Heero gone?

we recovered. You know
where he's headed.

42
00:05:17,737 --> 00:05:22,577
But how come he left Wing Zero
behind? What is he gonna have a
fistfight with Zechs?

43
00:05:22,577 --> 00:05:25,737
Knowing him he'll fight
whatever way he can.

44
00:05:25,737 --> 00:05:29,517
Well I'm pretty sure that's not
the only reason he went out.

45
00:05:29,517 --> 00:05:33,467
Wait a minute you mean he went
over there to save that girl?

46

Yeah.

47
00:05:34,407 --> 00:05:37,627
In that case I was giving
him too much credit.

48
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:41,687
I had him figured as the most
sane guy among the lot of us.

Well I'll tell ya it just goes
to show how powerful
that girl is

guy like Heero.

00:14:18,114 --> 00:14:20,564
Heero?

147
00:14:20,694 --> 00:14:26,604
Relena. Please try to make it
through all of this alive.

148
00:14:26,604 --> 00:14:27,364
Ah?

149
00:14:27,364 --> 00:14:30,824
Goodbye my dear little sister.
Goodbye.

150
00:14:30,824 --> 00:14:35,494
Milliardo. It was a hologram.

151
00:14:36,114 --> 00:14:39,134
Heero...

152
00:14:39,804 --> 00:14:45,804
The enemy front line has
entered our firing range.

153
00:14:45,804 --> 00:14:48,514
So how's the main cannon doing?

154
00:14:48,514 --> 00:14:52,914
It's all charged up but the
enemy is in mobile suits though.

155
00:14:52,914 --> 00:14:58,204
I'll send off warning shots. But
if Treize does not take
heed I might fire.

156
00:14:58,204 --> 00:15:03,134
[ZECHS] I've been trying to rid
myself of my gentle nature.

157
00:15:03,134 --> 00:15:05,754
Whatever you say sir.

158
00:15:10,824 --> 00:15:17,624
[SOLDIER] Your excellency:
Milliardo of the White Fang
has issued a warning.

159
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:23,494
He says that if we continue to
advance they'll fire
Libra's main cannon.

160
00:15:23,494 --> 00:15:26,824
Very well then.

161
00:15:26,824 --> 00:15:32,474
[TREIZE] This is Treize
Khushrenada. All forces
stop where you are.

162
00:15:36,694 --> 00:15:40,694
All units stand by till
further orders.

163
00:15:45,134 --> 00:15:52,384
[SOLDIER] Your excellency! Where
are you going? Please stop!
Your excellency!

164
00:15:57,454 --> 00:15:59,454
[MYSTERIOUS BELL]

165
00:15:59,454 --> 00:16:02,964
The captain of the enemy is
headed straight for us.

166
00:16:03,004 --> 00:16:04,604
Dispatch Virgos!

167
00:16:04,604 --> 00:16:07,714
Withdraw those orders at once!

168
00:16:07,714 --> 00:16:09,214
Commander?

169
00:16:09,224 --> 00:16:14,384
It's the Tallgeese that's
coming. I can guess who
the pilot is.

170
00:16:14,384 --> 00:16:19,364
[TREIZE] This is Treize
Khushrenada. Sovereign of
the World Nation.

171
00:16:19,364 --> 00:16:23,894
I wish to challenge Commander
Milliardo Peacecraft, leader
of the White Fang,

172
00:16:23,894 --> 00:16:25,894
to a duel.

173
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:29,404
A duel?! How outdated can you
get? [SOLDIER 1] Is he serious?

174
00:16:29,404 --> 00:16:32,654
[SOLDIER 2] No it's gotta be
an old trick of his.

175
00:16:32,654 --> 00:16:34,734
[DOROTHY] Mr. Treize...

[TAKEOFF SOUND]

178
00:16:50,254 --> 00:16:56,294
[TREIZE] Commander Milliardo.
I'm waiting for your reply.

179
00:16:56,294 --> 00:17:02,024
Let me remind you that the
decision you make will
also be interpreted

180
00:17:02,024 --> 00:17:05,004
as your solution to this war.

181
00:17:05,004 --> 00:17:09,804
My answer... is no!

182
00:17:09,804 --> 00:17:11,804
Well...

183
00:17:11,804 --> 00:17:14,824
[DOROTHY] But why Mr. Milliardo?

184
00:17:14,824 --> 00:17:21,314
I am no longer an OZ soldier.
Therefore chivalry has
absolutely no meaning to me.

185
00:17:21,314 --> 00:17:26,154
I am now supporting the people's
wish for a revolution.

186
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:31,624
[ZECHS] There's no way we can
decide on the destiny of
the colony citizens

187
00:17:31,624 --> 00:17:33,534
by a simple duel.

188
00:17:33,534 --> 00:17:36,964
I see. You've made the
correct choice.

189
00:17:36,964 --> 00:17:42,694
[ZECHS] Treize we will eliminate
anyone and everyone who
stands in our way.

190
00:17:42,694 --> 00:17:47,934
Milliardo as you are aware the
Earth is behind us

191
00:17:47,934 --> 00:17:52,294
[TREIZE] We will not retreat
because I love the Earth.

192
00:17:52,474 --> 00:17:54,751
That's the Treize I
know so well.

193
00:17:54,751 --> 00:17:58,041
Wait a minute Mr.
Malliardo please...

194
00:17:58,041 --> 00:18:03,821
Prepare to fire the cannon. Set
target to the Tallgeese &amp; to the
resource satellite M‐02.

195
00:18:03,821 --> 00:18:06,481
Hit the Tallgeese
with the cannon?!

196
00:18:06,481 --> 00:18:09,151
Just do it! Treize is
asking for it.

197
00:18:09,151 --> 00:18:15,191
Mr. Milliardo think this over. I
am begging you please you cannot
fire at Mr. Treize!

198
00:18:15,191 --> 00:18:19,461
Quanze come and restrain
Dorothy she's a traitor.

199
00:18:19,461 --> 00:18:21,681
Right!

200
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,821
Mr. Milliardo...

201
00:18:25,821 --> 00:18:28,661
Now!

202
00:18:28,661 --> 00:18:33,151
[SOLDIER] The captain's
headed this way!

203
00:18:33,151 --> 00:18:36,881
[ZECHS] I admire your
resolution Treize.

204

[SOLDIER] Ready to
fire main cannon.

205
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:43,591
If you defeat me now you'll have
earned your victory Zechs.

206
00:18:43,591 --> 00:18:48,441
Go ahead and fire for the peace
of the Earth and outer space.

207
00:18:48,441 --> 00:18:52,661
My enemy is the Earth and you
are the Earth's chief
representative

208
00:18:52,661 --> 00:18:54,661
Treize Kushrenada!

[SOLDIER] Commencing countdown.

210
00:18:57,861 --> 00:19:03,421
Let me take over. I want to put
an end to Treize myself.

211
00:19:03,421 --> 00:19:05,421
Yes sir.

[TARGETING SYSTEM BEEPING]

is the only road to peace.

00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:47,050
Drop it. Be quiet.

222
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:51,050
How long until the main cannon
can be fired again?

223
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,450
[SOLDIER] We'll need 140 minutes
to fully charge it sir.

[SOLDIER 2] A number of mobile
suit carriers are approaching
us from behind...

... they belong to the Earth
military. We're in position to
be attacked from both sides.

hope you don't have a
problem with that sir.

do that for?

beautiful yet
sorrowful battlefield?

course for Earth and

in its path. The collision
between the two
