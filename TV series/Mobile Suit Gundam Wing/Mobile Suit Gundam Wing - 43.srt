The sense of independence built

the mindset to develop
productivity and defense.

104
00:10:32,354 --> 00:10:34,994
This leads to the nation
becoming militaristic

105
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:38,594
which means that every country
on the Earth will jump
into OZ's arms

The new system, since OZ and the

influence on Earth.

113
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:16,294
On behalf of my nation, I've
come here so I might find out
more about this situation.

114
00:11:16,554 --> 00:11:17,574
Your nation?

115

Yes, my nation. I've come here
from the Sanc Kingdom, my name

recovering from it's strife that
was caused by the wars.

As an individual I think I

to the space colonies desiring
their own military power.
