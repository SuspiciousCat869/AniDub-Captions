Mission accepted!

00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,920
Heero ended up doing it.

4
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,370
He took his life.

5
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:50,780
I promise!

6
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:54,040
One day my Gundam will
definitely fight again.

[Narrator:] After staging a coup
dÈtat to overthrow
the Alliance...

9
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:08,170
...OZ continues to create one
disaster after another...

10
00:02:08,170 --> 00:02:10,600
...in its quest to
demolish the Alliance.

11
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:13,610
Since the Alliance has a
presence in every nation...

12
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:17,550
...the total number of
casualties is expected to rise.

13
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:20,190
Relena...

14
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:23,280
Hey, you've woken up!

15
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,870
Wait a minute, I'll
go get Trowa!

16
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:27,130
Trowa?

17
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:29,740
You should take it easy!

18
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,530
Trowa, your friend is woken up!

19
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:40,730
Oh, you must be hungry!

20
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:42,730
I'll go make some soup.

21
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,520
Where am I?

22
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,740
Along the route of a
traveling circus.

23
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,360
Where I hide myself.

24
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,240
Why'd you save me?

25
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,480
I was supposed to
die with honor.

26
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,650
You died a long time ago.

27
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,980
The forces retaliating against

28
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,920
OZ have ignored our advice with
regards to disarmament...

29
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:07,560
...and are causing unnecessary
carnage in various places
around the world.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,930
One month has passed, and OZ has
done nothing to the colonies.

31
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,280
They're just controlling nations
under their military power.

32
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,480
A month has already gone by?!

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,680
[TV ANNOUNCEMENT]

34
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,680
In OZ's eyes, you're
already dead.

35
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,160
You're no longer restrained
to the colonies.

36
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:30,560
In my case it's not that simple.

37
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,360
They found you, Trowa?

38
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:35,790
No, but there hasn't been one
mission since that day.

39
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,610
I see.

40
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:43,390
I'm not so sure what to do.

41
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:47,340
What would happen if OZ used the
colonies as a shield again?

42
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,450
Or should I be
following your example?

43
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,960
In that case, I've
got one warning.

44
00:03:55,070 --> 00:03:55,575
Hm?

45
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:57,980
It hurts like hell.

[LAUGHING]

47
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,990
Hey, I think that's probably the
first time I've heard Trowa
laugh out loud.

48
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:09,630
I've got a big favor to ask you,
Trowa:

49
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:14,140
Could you tell me what was going
on while I was lying
here unconscious?

50
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:17,240
Sure thing.

51
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:38,800
What a strong flap
that bird has.

52
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,040
Hurry up, get on!

53
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,550
Hurry, Sally!

54
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,940
We're all out of there!

55
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,520
Aargh!

56
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:04,600
Sally here. Explosions
successful. We're retreating!

57
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:09,760
What the hell's the noise?!

58
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,790
Colonel Bundt, it's
the guerillas.

59
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:15,340
Go after them and smash them all
to pieces this time!

60
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,120
Yes, Sir!

[Narrator:] In former China,
within an autonomous district in
a mountainous area...

62
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:28,010
...a political leader proposing
peace, was assassinated.

63
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:31,000
He had advocated
demilitarization

64
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:34,410
and share his objectives with
the present military.

65
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:40,220
However, he became a a coup
d'Ètat by The Alliance's
occupational army.

66
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:45,530
Colonel Bundt, the ringleader,
had disagreed with this
push for peace...

67
00:05:45,530 --> 00:05:48,330
...and explained that the
military must be strengthened...

68
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:51,680
...in order for the nation to
achieve independence.

69
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,400
Got em!

70
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:05,980
What's wrong, Sally?

71
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:07,840
Don't worry about it.

72
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:12,540
I'm sorry, Sally... it's your
first time home in a
long time...

73
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:14,540
...and we've put you
in such danger.

74
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,240
Don't apologize. It
was my decision.

75
00:06:17,530 --> 00:06:18,600
Hey you guys!

76
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:19,610
Are you all right?

77
00:06:19,610 --> 00:06:22,250
Yeah, it was a huge success!

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,280
What happened?!

79
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,200
It's Leo, the land mobile suits!

80
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,110
Colonel Bundt has ordered that
not one person should escape!

81
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,650
You fools!

82
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,800
I found them!

83
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,080
They're climbing the slope!

84
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,080
That weapon's useless
against suits!

85
00:06:57,080 --> 00:06:59,610
But even if I can destroy
its main camera...!

86
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:01,930
I won't even tell you to
drop your weapons!

87
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:04,350
I'll just have you die!!

88
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,280
I told you, it's useless!

89
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,820
What, is that their back up?

90
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,930
It's a Gundam!!

91
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:15,920
What?

92
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,420
It's a Gundam.

93
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,330
Fire!

94
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:20,570
Fire! Fire!!

95
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:23,900
I do not intend to fight.

96
00:07:24,670 --> 00:07:26,030
Hurry up and retreat.

97
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,990
Hey, we can beat this thing!

98
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:33,660
Don't underestimate Nataku!

99
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,020
Damn you!

100
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,460
It's a Gundam...

101
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,240
What's a Gundam doing
around here?

102
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,520
Weaklings like you
shouldn't be fighting.

103
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,950
What do you mean by that?!

104
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:08,300
Why fight an enemy you don't
stand a chance against?!

105
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,860
Because it's a fight we
must take on!

106
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,000
So, somebody ordered you
to fight them?

107
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:16,060
No! We're doing it because that
what we decided on!

108
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,070
I don't understand this.

109
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,190
Hmpf...

110
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:21,500
Huh...

111
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,720
You look like you're pretty
exhausted from the day.

112
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,880
Why don't you come with us
and rest a bit?

113
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:27,740
Sally...!

114
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,360
What's wrong with that? At least
we know he's not the enemy.

115
00:08:31,920 --> 00:08:32,730
Well?

116
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,130
Are you absolutely certain
it was a Gundam?!

117
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,840
I have no doubt about it. I'll
bring up the image for you.

118
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,550
Hmm... that's definitely a
Gundam all right.

119
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,380
Even OZ is having trouble
controlling those Gundams.

120
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,360
I'll return to the base!

121
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:51,790
Right.

122
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:57,520
Sleep well last night?

123
00:08:57,520 --> 00:08:58,640
Yeah.

124
00:08:58,830 --> 00:09:02,140
You didn't really need to help
out with getting the food
you know, Wu‐Fei.

125
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:04,140
I'm returning your favor.

126
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:06,320
We're the ones that
owe you a favor!

127
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:09,260
It wasn't me that saved you,
It was Nataku.

128
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,410
Nataku? Is that name you
call your Gundam?

129
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:14,570
Fine...

130
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:21,290
Here's the last.

131
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:30,590
You Better watch what you say.

132
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:32,960
I'm begging you to please stop!

133
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,160
Shut your trap!

134
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:37,050
I was just asking you to pay
for what you ate!

135
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:41,660
Why do you think you were able
to open this shop in the
first place, huh?

136
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,880
You are trying to collect money
from the soldiers who
protect the country?!

137
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,030
What exactly are you
claiming to protect?

138
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:48,840
What?!

139
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:53,790
All you ever do is stick to
Bundt and trample over the
nation's peace efforts.

140
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:55,790
What did you say?

141
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,080
Cow!

142
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:10,890
This is what happens when
people oppose us!

143
00:10:18,270 --> 00:10:19,660
You asked for it!

144
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,470
Stop it!

145
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:23,280
You're defeated.

146
00:10:28,090 --> 00:10:30,120
Wh‐What's gotten into
you people?!

147
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,420
Calm down...

148
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,510
Oh no!

149
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:35,050
We'll get you next time!

150
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,650
Thank you, Wu Fei.

151
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:40,360
You saved us again.

152
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,360
You are too weak to fight.

153
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:42,970
Huh?

154
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,200
I don't have any right to fight.

155
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,690
Wu Fei...

156
00:10:47,850 --> 00:10:49,640
I'm such a coward.

157
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:53,130
I can't understand how you could
ever call yourself a coward.

158
00:10:53,130 --> 00:10:57,000
I can because I lost to a man
stronger than me.

159
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:01,240
I'm nothing but a coward who can
only fight those
weaker than myself.

160
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,970
Is that why you're giving up?

161
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:05,100
Weren't you fighting
for the colonies?

162
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,800
To win back peace?

163
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,040
I have no right to
fight with Nataku.

164
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:12,750
But you saved my life yesterday!

165
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:14,960
That's because you
people are weak.

166
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:16,190
You're right.

167
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,720
We are weak. But we
won't give up!

168
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,480
People join our fight
because we're weak!

169
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,600
The same way you did.

170
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:31,150
I have no right to
fight with Nataku.

171
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:34,890
Wu Fei...

172
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:47,500
From this data, we've determined
that this area here...

173
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:49,500
...is likely where the
guerrilla's headquarters are.

174
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,100
I see. We finally know
where they're hiding.

175
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:54,990
But now they have the Gundam.

176
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,470
The Gundams are incredibly
powerful in battle.

177
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:01,120
If we fought it head on, it'd
cost considerably
damage our forces.

178
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:04,640
Given the situation, why don't
we ask for OZ's assistance...

179
00:12:04,640 --> 00:12:06,120
...and stage a joint attack?

180
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:09,120
I completely disagree! That
would give OZ an excuse to...

181
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,340
...establish themselves
in our nation.

182
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,830
What about our self‐government?

183
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,040
We've got to fight on our own to
prove to the citizens...

184
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,040
...that we're stil in control.

185
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,440
Colonel, do you still
favor this idea?

186
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:23,980
Major Nanaki. I wouldn't want to
do anything that would
risk losing...

187
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,980
...even one of you
elite soldiers.

188
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,720
I appreciate that sir, but we
already swore our lives...

189
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:31,120
...to this nation when we
declared independence.

190
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:32,160
That's right, Colonel!

191
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,910
We must protect our
nation by ourselves!

192
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:36,700
That's what makes us
independent!

193
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,340
Right! I understand your
determination!

194
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,650
We'll wipe out the guerrillas
using our own forces!

195
00:12:42,650 --> 00:12:44,330
For our fatherland!

196
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:45,370
Yes, sir!

197
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,910
Hi Sally; how did
things work out?

198
00:12:57,130 --> 00:12:59,550
Hey, I thought that kid
went with you.

199
00:12:59,550 --> 00:13:00,890
We had a little fight.

200
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,540
I see.

201
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:05,680
Well, he's probably not gonna
leave that thing behind.

202
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:07,500
You're right.

203
00:13:08,010 --> 00:13:11,850
It was thinking how great it
would be if that kid
would fight with us.

204
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,860
Nobody should be trying to force
him into fighting right now.

205
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,120
Why's that?

206
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,670
He's very confused now.

207
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:22,910
So much was expected of him
during the war and he was
unable to deliver.

208
00:13:22,910 --> 00:13:25,440
So now he thinks he's a loser.

209
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,440
Well, if you say so.

210
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,720
You're the military doctor,
right?

We found it, we
found the Gundam!

Major! The Gundam's not fighting
back! I'll transmit the image!

There's a camouflage net! The
pilot's not in there!

230

Colonel Bundt! The Gundam isn't
fighting back for some reason.

join you shortly.

now in our favor.

Those are OZ's Aries!

Colonel Bundt! OZ is staging an
attack on our forces!

245
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:33,720
Our forces? But Major Nanaki, OZ
is part of our forces!

246
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,560
They sent support troops to
assist us in protecting
our nation...

247
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,130
...from the Gundam menace.

248
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:42,560
But a number of soldiers were
disgruntled over OZ's support...

249
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,490
...and betrayed us to join
the guerrillas.

Colonel! What are you
trying to say?!

That's exactly what happened.

I'm sure that once OZ takes
over, our nation will
regain peace.

I believe the citizens will
feel the same way.

That's absurd! There's no way
the citizens would
want OZ to rule!!

OZ says they'll recognize our
nation's will to self‐govern.

And of course, they'll keep me
on as the Head of State.

of anything other than
your own rank?

advantage of Nataku's strength.

322
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:28,410
You were different this time.

323
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:31,160
This time your heart
was really in it.

324
00:20:31,930 --> 00:20:35,040
What the point of having
strength if you don't
have the heart?

325
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:38,750
Wu Fei, when you're able to
fight with Nataku

326
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:40,750
I hope you'll come and
help me again.

327
00:20:40,910 --> 00:20:43,640
Even though you're so weak
you're still gonna fight?

328
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:47,000
The most important thing is that
my heart is in it.

329
00:20:48,090 --> 00:20:48,800
Hmm...

330
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:51,880
Hey everyone, gather around!

331
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:53,080
Ha ha ha

332
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,690
Our next performance
is confirmed!

333
00:20:55,690 --> 00:20:56,650
Hold onto your hats!

334
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:59,080
We got a request
from an OZ base!

335
00:20:59,080 --> 00:21:00,170
From OZ?

336
00:21:00,570 --> 00:21:03,710
And to celebrate I would like to
try something new.

337
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:07,840
Something special and exciting
that the OZ soldiers
just might enjoy.

338
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,920
Could you leave this new
performance up to me?

339
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,470
Have you got some ideas?

340
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,430
Yeah and I think it'll be a big
hit with the soldiers.

341
00:21:16,430 --> 00:21:17,150
Wow!

342
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:20,300
Trowa's usually so quiet, so it
must be a good idea.

343
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:21,690
Hmm... Right!

344
00:21:21,690 --> 00:21:23,690
I'm going to let you
handle this, Trowa!

345
00:21:24,760 --> 00:21:26,780
I'll leave some food and
keys to the car.

346
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:28,780
Stay here and concentrate
on getting better.

347
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,900
What are you planning to do?

348
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:35,600
In my colony consensus wasn't
reached to fight
using the Gundams.

349
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:39,600
The Gundam attack was started by
a small percentage of
the population...

350
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:40,830
...who felt strongly about it.

351
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:42,720
I was one of those people.

352
00:21:43,610 --> 00:21:46,360
There's nothing wrong with
acting on your emotions.

353
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,360
At least that's what
I was taught.

354
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,920
I mustn't give OZ a reason to
invade the colonies.

355
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:53,660
It wouldn't be rational.

356
00:21:54,650 --> 00:21:56,280
So I will do as you have done.

357
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:58,670
I'll simply follow my emotions.

358
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,680
Is this the apparatus you'll be
using in the performance, Trowa?

359
00:22:04,940 --> 00:22:08,250
I promise it'll be a real blast;
like nothing you have seen.

360
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:11,960
That's the spirit young man!
Make it the performance
of your life.

361
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:13,480
Hahaha

362
00:22:15,390 --> 00:22:19,500
Yeah. It'll be my last
grandstand show.

363
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:23,960
[To be continued]

364
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:29,050
[MUSIC]

365
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:41,840
[Narrator:] Within OZ where
cruelty is the fundamental
element of the soldiers...

366
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,800
...is there no one who can
calmly interpret the war?

367
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,120
Their excessive military power
results in one massacre
after another.

368
00:23:49,450 --> 00:23:53,420
Meanwhile, OZ begins directing
its advancement
towards outer space.

369
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:57,340
In an effort to save the
colonies, Trowa heads for
his final battle.

370
00:23:57,340 --> 00:24:00,840
But Catherine stands between the
young man and his death wish.

371
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:03,770
Next, on Gundam Wing,
episode 13:

372
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,470
"Catherine's Tears"
