00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:39,789
[TREIZE] Fellow comrades: Only
warriors exist in this world.

4
00:01:39,789 --> 00:01:44,079
That purity is what makes this
battlefield so beautiful.

5
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,079
Let us finish the final battle
of mankind and keep the
horrors of war

6
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:52,559
away from our home.
[VOICES] Yeah!

7
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:58,279
[LADY UN] This battle is a
crucial moment in our history.
It must be something that

8
00:01:58,279 --> 00:02:03,579
people will talk about for
generations to come. For that
reason many warriors here

9
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:07,699
will end up having to
sacrifice their lives.

10
00:02:07,699 --> 00:02:12,279
[VOICE] All mobile doll troops
have entered battle with the
enemy's main force

11
00:02:12,279 --> 00:02:14,339
and commando unit.

12
00:02:14,359 --> 00:02:20,299
This battle is only the
beginning. We must make Earth
and all its residents

13
00:02:20,299 --> 00:02:24,899
know the strength and
determination of the
space colonies.

[ALARM] [SOLDIER] Have you
checked the system?

16
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:37,579
[SOLDIER 2] Yes sir!

17
00:02:39,139 --> 00:02:40,719
Heero...

18
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:44,139
I'm going to stay here until
this battle settles.

19
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:49,479
It'll be hard for Treize to
destroy Libra right now so when

20
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:52,279
the time comes I'll
do it myself.

21
00:02:52,279 --> 00:02:57,279
But I still think we have to
stop this battle. Dictators
are the only ones who

22
00:02:57,279 --> 00:03:00,049
sacrifice lives in order
to achieve peace.

23
00:03:00,049 --> 00:03:04,299
But Zechs and Treize are ready
to sacrifice their own lives.

24
00:03:04,299 --> 00:03:07,319
That's why I have no intention
of stopping them.

25
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,119
Yeah, but‐

26
00:03:09,119 --> 00:03:12,359
You stay right here with me.

27
00:03:12,359 --> 00:03:15,789
You're going to look
after me Heero?

28
00:03:15,789 --> 00:03:21,719
I just don't want to feel like I
owe Zechs something when we
end up fighting.

29
00:03:25,279 --> 00:03:31,279
If this battleship does go down
there wouldn't be a
reason left for you

30
00:03:31,279 --> 00:03:34,279
to fight my brother.

31
00:03:37,739 --> 00:03:44,389
[HOWARD] So far the two sides
seem to be pretty even. So who
will we side with?

32
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:49,519
Well it looks even now but
that's only because Libra hasn't
shot its main weapon.

33
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,879
'Cuz every time they fire it it
needs to be fixed. That's
helping out the Earth's side.

34
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,249
But once it's fixed then the
White Fang will have
the advantage.

35
00:03:59,249 --> 00:04:04,189
The White Fang only represents
the opinions of a portion
of the colonies.

36
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:09,449
They don't stand for the
colonies as a whole. I'm sure
many people in the colonies

37
00:04:09,449 --> 00:04:11,519
are hoping for peace.

38
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,849
Maybe. But would helping Treize
really be in the best
interest of space?

39
00:04:16,849 --> 00:04:21,989
Treize is only fighting against
Libra and the mobile dolls.
Not the colonies.

40
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,879
That's a good point. The main
threat right now is definitely
the White Fang and Libra.

41
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:32,629
You sold me. Libra has got
way too much power.

42
00:04:32,629 --> 00:04:35,809
But what about Heero and Ms.
Relena?

43
00:04:35,809 --> 00:04:38,679
They'll be just fine,
knowing him.

44
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:40,919
OK. Then it's settled?

45
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:45,209
You bet. Just keep Peacemillion
headed straight for Libra.

[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

47
00:04:47,939 --> 00:04:51,139
[SOLDIER] We've confirmed
Peacemillion's location.

48
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,159
They're going around the battle
zone and coming toward us.

49
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:59,319
Those idiots! The Gundams are
still regarding us as enemies

50
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:02,119
even at a time like this!

51
00:05:02,119 --> 00:05:07,099
[LAUGHING] That's no surprise.
From their perspective every
force is an enemy.

52
00:05:07,099 --> 00:05:11,589
[QUINZE] This is no laughing
matter. We can't afford to
send our front line

53
00:05:11,609 --> 00:05:14,979
mobile dolls to face them. We
have no means to stop them.

54
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:16,779
I'll face them.

me. [QUINZE] Only 3?!
That's crazy!

alive. [QUINZE]

cannon fixed?

guard Peacemillion. The
Taurus doesn't have the

60
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:43,129

other suits and I think I know
who we'll be facing.

come. It's him but he's only got
3 Virgos with him.

mobile dolls should be used.

by those Gundams. I would
gladly thank them for

76

their help but the fact is
they're not necessarily
fighting for my sake.

They wanna decrease their
enemies. Maybe

Nice work Milliardo. The mobile
suits are right where
you want 'em.

[TREIZE] Even our commando unit
can't get any closer to Libra.

[QUINZE] Has MO‐2 still not
moved during the battle?

00:08:06,017 --> 00:08:09,847
[SOLDIER] No they've done
nothing but take in damaged
mobile suits sir.

96
00:08:09,847 --> 00:08:15,257
I thought they might have a new
weapon but maybe they're
nothing more than a

97
00:08:15,257 --> 00:08:17,417

move the Libra.

declined Treize's
offer to a duel.

[QUINZE] Calculate a course that
will take us around
MO‐2 to Earth.

00:08:33,887 --> 00:08:37,557
And don't forget to
inform the commander!

103
00:08:42,757 --> 00:08:45,977
That was the correct decision.

104
00:08:45,977 --> 00:08:51,457
But can you tell the people of
space that this decision is
also a very sad one.

106
00:08:54,207 --> 00:09:00,487
[ZECHS] No problem. Right now we
must show Earth how sad it
is here in space.

107
00:09:00,737 --> 00:09:05,677
[SOLDIER] Libra's leaving the
line of battle! It's
heading for MO‐2.

108
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:11,197
At the moment MO‐2 has very
little military force and it
can't move on its own.

109
00:09:11,197 --> 00:09:15,797
I'm guessing Libra will go
around MO‐2 and head
straight for the Earth.

Then let's go after them!

even have the weapons we need
to destroy Libra?

to destroy Libra's main cannon!

No chance. It's the only

Get down now and cover up your

plowing into us!

Well I guess now we don't
have to turn 'em off!

But it's bleeding.

Now Zechs won't have
his victory.

[ZECHS] What's the damage?

[QUINZE] The main cannon is
completely useless.

181
00:14:51,388 --> 00:14:53,738
And the engine?

182
00:14:53,738 --> 00:14:57,788
Well it has been damaged sir.
But it still can get up to
about 70% capacity.

183
00:14:57,788 --> 00:15:01,938
Then we still have a strategy.

[DUO] Oh man that was one big
collision if I've ever seen one.

185
00:15:11,388 --> 00:15:16,348
As it stands now it'd be hard to
destroy just Libra.

[SALLY] This is Peacemillion.

We're not at any risk of
exploding right now but we're
pretty much stuck here.

00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:29,158
I understand. We'll board Libra
and take over the
ship from within.

189
00:15:29,158 --> 00:15:34,478
We'll destroy the mobile doll
control system &amp; then order
the White Fang to

190
00:15:34,478 --> 00:15:38,468
[QUATRE] surrender. Also we've
gotta find Heero and Ms. Relena.

So we're going in? This reminds
me of the old days.

I'll leave it to you.

Just let him go. He's
keeping an old promise.

196
00:15:54,508 --> 00:15:57,938
We should hurry and
get to Libra.

tremendous blow to the Earth
and by using such a

awaken the fears of war and an
