<i>name given to a cockpit</i>
<i>system that quickly</i>

3
00:01:29,881 --> 00:01:34,226
<i>calculates battle data and feeds</i>
<i>the large amounts of statistics</i>

<i>on estimated values directly</i>
<i>back to the pilot.</i>

5
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:42,811
<i>But, this system also drives a</i>
<i>pilot to his limits.</i>

6
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,231
<i>To the extent that he won't even</i>

Sanc Kingdom's Collapse

13
00:02:15,845 --> 00:02:21,683
[REBEL:] Our enemy isn't Oz,
it's the Romefeller Foundation,
the ruling class on Earth.

14
00:02:22,018 --> 00:02:25,230
But would you seriously consider
teaming up with the
Treize Faction?

15
00:02:26,188 --> 00:02:29,713
Our first priority is to regain
control of outer space.

16
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:33,173
We'll need to take in soldiers
of the former alliance.

17
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:36,093
Absurd! There's no way we could
team up with them.

18
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,813
Unless those of us that consider
Romefeller an enemy all team up,

19
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:42,413
there's no way we can
break their control!

20
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:47,501
Maybe. What do you think, Duo?

21
00:02:48,961 --> 00:02:52,493
Well, it's true that Romefeller
is an enemy to us,

22
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:55,718
the Treize Faction, and to
the former Alliance.

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,848
But still, it's just as
important to think about what
happens once we defeat him.

24
00:03:02,641 --> 00:03:04,601
Talk to me again once you
figure that out.

25
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,728
Hey there! Duo!

26
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,193
[DUO:] Until then, I'll continue
fighting alone to
defeat Romefeller.

00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:23,871
Hey! How did it go?

28
00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,133

going anywhere.

00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:35,153

00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,173

00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,551
I‐uh nothing. Just delete that!

33
00:03:39,053 --> 00:03:41,888
Whoa, was that totally out of
character or what!?

34
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:46,153
Hey Duo, let's go somewhere
that's really fun!

35
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:48,020
Somewhere fun?

Yeah, let's go! Hurry, let's go!

37
00:03:58,363 --> 00:04:01,933
[NOIN:] Oz's mobile doll troops
have moved to the boundaries
of the Sanc Kingdom.

38
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:05,496
and forces have been gathering
in the surrounding
military bases.

39
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:12,336
[NOIN:] It's unmistakable. Oz
is‐ no, Romefeller is planning
to destroy the Sanc Kingdom.

40
00:04:14,755 --> 00:04:17,258
It's only a matter of time
before they attack.

41
00:04:19,385 --> 00:04:23,931
Very well then. I want to
talk to Duke Dermail.

42
00:04:24,848 --> 00:04:28,686
No wait, Romefeller now regards
the Sanc Kingdom as an enemy.

43
00:04:29,228 --> 00:04:32,315
We have no choice but to fight
to save the Kingdom!

44
00:04:32,481 --> 00:04:37,353
The Sanc Kingdom under the
Peacecraft rule has always
practiced the idea of pacifism.

45
00:04:37,486 --> 00:04:40,893
We should advocate for
disarmament and aim for a
peaceful world where no

46
00:04:41,031 --> 00:04:43,743
battles are fought. Therefore
we mustn't fight.

47
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:48,288
Sure, but you have to understand
the Sanc Kingdom is about
to be annihilated.

48
00:04:48,998 --> 00:04:52,960
But still. I am going to do
everything I can to avoid a war.

49
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:59,553
[NOIN:] I can understand Miss
Relena's ideals however,

50
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:02,970
Romefeller's military is trying
to invade the country

51
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:07,653
Relena's too caught up in her
ideal world. ‐What's that
supposed to mean?

52
00:05:07,808 --> 00:05:12,480
With things the way they are
around the world, it'd be
impossible to achieve
total pacifism.

53
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,816
So, you're disputing Miss
Relena's ideals? ‐I'm not.

54
00:05:17,693 --> 00:05:22,906
Total pacifism is what people
are hoping for, and people can't
live without hope.

55
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:26,535
Tell me Heero, do you have any
hopes of your own?

56
00:05:27,078 --> 00:05:29,955
I only want to fight against
those who try to conquer.

57
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,251
I wonder how Quatre's doing.

58
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:38,088
I hope he's able to come back
here as soon as possible.

[NARRATOR:] Meanwhile, Colonel
Tubarov was executing his plans

108
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:42,500
to construct a gigantic space
battleship, as ordered by the
Romefeller Foundation.

109
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:47,588
This project, commandeering the
manpower and resources
of outer space,

110
00:09:48,046 --> 00:09:51,883
was becoming a significant
burden on the citizens
of the colonies.

00:09:52,175 --> 00:09:57,293
<i>We're progressing at an</i>

<i>enormous size of the battleship,</i>

[DERMAIL:] Symbol sir?

115
00:10:06,981 --> 00:10:10,778
Oz currently lacks an individual
that can fill Treize's place!

116
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:15,783
So it's crucial that Oz has a
symbol of strength to bring the
soldiers together.

117
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:21,013
And we must also eliminate the
existence of any country that
disrupts such unity!

118
00:10:21,163 --> 00:10:23,790
You're talking about the Sanc
Kingdom of course.

119
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:26,820
The Sanc Kingdom most certainly
had a role to play in

120
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,171
proving Oz's support for
peace policies.

than a hindrance to us!

Duke Dermail contacted me just
a little while ago.

for our unrestricted acceptance

of Oz deserters and
armed guerrillas.

this storm of firepower.

Didn't you follow Pagan's
instructions Dorothy?

You have to leave at once.

Who, me? My stay at

159

would be all but meaningless if
I couldn't witness
this situation.

[DOROTHY:] What do you plan
to do Miss Relena?

161
00:14:19,276 --> 00:14:23,905
Will you keep resisting? Or will
you get military resistance
from your allies?

162
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,200
That method is not an option
in the Sanc Kingdom.

But what other methods are
there Miss Relena?

164

If the Sanc Kingdom were to
collapse now, then the ideal of
total pacifism would vanish!

As if it were a dream. [RELENA:]

What all the people are wishing
for is true peace.

You can assemble people with
your sweet talk about peace,

don't even do a thing!

not exactly true!

That's because you're chasing

total pacifism.

179

How can you say that?

180
00:15:53,953 --> 00:15:57,913
My teacher told me something
once; that man is a
fighting animal

181
00:15:58,041 --> 00:16:01,893
and that whoever wins after
continuously fighting
should rule.

182
00:16:02,045 --> 00:16:04,965
Isn't that the way to bring
about proper order?

183
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:08,713
Order could never bring about
peace in such a situation,

184
00:16:08,843 --> 00:16:10,511
that's nothing but domination!

185
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:14,793
But one can start to establish
order merely by thinking
this way, right?

186
00:16:14,933 --> 00:16:17,336
What can one accomplish
with total pacifism

to those fighting animals.

This is the time to stand up and
fight Miss Relena!

199
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:32,693
[RELENA:] Just because humans
are fighting animals,

200
00:17:32,845 --> 00:17:34,873
that doesn't make this
situation right!
