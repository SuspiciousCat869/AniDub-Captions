319
00:17:40,010 --> 00:17:42,010
are stemming from some jealousy?

320
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:43,370
Absolutely not!

321
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:46,330
Until now hostilities have only
been sparked by attempts...

322
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:48,330
... of the Alliance military
to take control!

323
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,660
‐Your true feelings are
finally coming out!

324
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,851
You’re a spy and you’ve been

325
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,850
secretly communicating
with the colonies!

326
00:17:53,850 --> 00:17:55,200
That’s ridiculous!

327
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,410
We’ve heard everything
you have to say.

328
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,600
I’d like you to leave the room now
Vice Foreign Minister.

329
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:03,260
Isn’t it about time you
people realized...

330
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:06,580
...the ones posing the most threat
are none other than yourselves!

331
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:08,810
<i>‐Silence! we’ve had enough!</i>

332
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:11,580
[♪♪]

333
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:15,010
So tension returns at
Lagrange point, huh.

334
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,130
I believe that’s the way
things should be.

335
00:18:18,460 --> 00:18:20,940
The leak worked quite
well I thought.

336
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,000
My hat’s off to Zechs.

337
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,890
He really does a fine job.

338
00:18:24,890 --> 00:18:26,440
Oh by the way, lady Une.

339
00:18:26,570 --> 00:18:27,540
Yes?

340
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:30,060
About Vice Foreign
Minister Darlian...

341
00:18:30,850 --> 00:18:32,170
I’ll see to it.

342
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:36,420
And I’ll have some rose fragrance
ready in time for your next bath.

343
00:18:38,290 --> 00:18:39,970
Sounds good.

344
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:50,810
[yawning]

345
00:18:50,890 --> 00:18:52,810
Man, what the heck’s he thinkin’?

346
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,810
I’m sackin’ out.

347
00:18:57,100 --> 00:19:03,900
[welding]

348
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,090
Duo: What’s goin’ on?!

349
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:23,210
Unreal! I don’t believe it!

350
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:26,680
The guy’s incredible; he fixed his
machine in one night.

351
00:19:26,680 --> 00:19:28,360
<i>Mechanic: ‐Oh no!!</i>

352
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:29,580
We’ve been had!

353
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,840
he took his parts from this suit!

354
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,120
What?!

355
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:35,120
I was just complimenting him!

356
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,900
Traitor!!!

357
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,780
[♪♪]

358
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,600
Target confirmed.

359
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,650
[explosion]

360
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:06,650
[laughs hysterically]

361
00:20:07,370 --> 00:20:26,060
[violin and flute with
background rock music]

362
00:20:49,850 --> 00:20:51,660
It’s almost fixed!

363
00:20:51,690 --> 00:20:52,720
They’re a similar make,

364
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:53,930
so it was very easy.

365
00:20:53,930 --> 00:20:55,930
They're so similar its
kind of freaky!

366
00:20:55,930 --> 00:20:57,380
Don’t you think so boss?

367
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:58,040
yeah.

368
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,540
That’s why Quatre is so concerned.

369
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:05,220
I’m just relieved this guy who can
fight as well as Quatre...

370
00:21:05,300 --> 00:21:06,820
...isn’t an enemy.

371
00:21:19,890 --> 00:21:22,370
‐Noin, are you alright in there?

372
00:21:22,600 --> 00:21:23,930
Yeah.

373
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:27,140
Just feeling a little beat
up inside and out.

374
00:21:28,810 --> 00:21:30,120
Noin...

375
00:21:31,340 --> 00:21:33,640
I’m just grateful that
you’re alive.

376
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,160
You’re just saying that cause
if I died i’d get

377
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:37,500
a two rank promotion.

378
00:21:37,890 --> 00:21:40,650
You’ve got nothing to worry about
with that sense of humor.

379
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:43,720
‐Listen you’ve gotta let me fight
the enemy with you!

380
00:21:43,940 --> 00:21:45,930
I wanna re‐train and get stronger!

381
00:21:46,050 --> 00:21:48,960
I’ve been through hell with
that Gundam as well.

382
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:50,850
But the next time I see them

383
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:52,930
they won’t be getting
off so easily.

384
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,320
Oh Zechs...

385
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,260
I’d be happy if you worked
along side me, Noin.

386
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,680
I’d be happy to, thank you.

387
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:06,340
[hyena’s growling]

388
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:09,440
Get out of my sight,
you weaklings!!

389
00:22:10,140 --> 00:22:13,690
[whimpering]

390
00:22:13,890 --> 00:22:15,610
Fighting a weak enemy leaves

391
00:22:15,610 --> 00:22:18,450
me feeling so empty afterwards.

392
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:21,620
Aaaaaaaghhhhh!!!

393
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:23,760
