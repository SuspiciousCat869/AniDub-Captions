‐ a symbol of OZ's domination ‐

of the White Fang.

5
00:01:35,910 --> 00:01:40,710
As a result the map of power in
space is drastically rewritten

6
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:46,000
with Milliardo Peacecraft now
the leader of outer space in
both name and reality.

Meanwhile on Earth – With Queen
Relena at the helm the

00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,700
on its way to forming an
unarmed World Nation

9
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,000
which has realized
total pacifism.

10
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,000
But with Treize Khushrenada's
return Relena is relieved
of her duties.

Lt. Nichole. Glad you're OK,
sir.

15
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,970
Hardly "OK." There were
only 18 survivors.

16
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:47,970
Unfortunately that's all I was
able to bring back from Barge.

17
00:02:47,970 --> 00:02:50,660
What's that, Lieutenant?

18
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,440
We survived in dishonor just so
we could bring her back
here to the Earth.

[NICHOLE] Please, you must take
her to his excellency Treize.

completely healed but she's
still in a coma.

My dear Lady. I'm glad you
made it back home.

I can't tell you how good it is
to be able to see you again.

You never left my heart
for a moment.

24
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:39,730
But Lady... I want you to see
how I handle things now.

25
00:03:39,730 --> 00:03:44,970
A fantastic battle is about to
commence between
space and Earth.

26
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,820
And it's sure to end the
pathetic history
mankind has created.

27
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:56,000
A star role in this final scene
would be too much of a burden
for Relena Peacecraft.

28
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,750
I must take on the role as the
leader of the
Romefeller Foundation.

29
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:02,840
That's right.

30
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:08,170
She can take on the role of
establishing the new history
we're about to lay out

31
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:14,040
for her. Relena Peacecraft shall
be the new hope for the
people of the Earth.

32
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,310
[TREIZE] I'm hereby making an
announcement to the
leaders of the world.

33
00:04:27,310 --> 00:04:31,220
What's the purpose of our World
Nation's existence?

34
00:04:31,220 --> 00:04:35,330
The previous sovereign, Queen
Relena, said it was
“true peace,”

35
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:39,510
but were the people able
to live in peace?

36
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:46,350
The answer to that is no. People
continue to live in uncertainty
and feel threatened.

37
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:49,200
And why is that?

38
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:54,840
Because an armed organization
calling themselves White Fang

39
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,680
is challenging us to a war. We
mustn't allow this
tyrannical behavior

40
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:03,110
they've exhibited towards us.

41
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,610
I say to the leaders of the
world. No, I say this to all
the citizens of the

42
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:14,750
World Nation: Now's the time to
unite as one force and fight
against this threat

43
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,750
from outer space. And then our
victory over them
shall earn unity

44
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,750
and peace for the Earth. Is that
not our mission in this life?

Once Treize becomes

it would be too awkward
to stay with us.

00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:16,460
[WU FEI] I don't care.
‐ Take Zero.

148
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,400
What?! [SALLY PO] Heero...

149
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,930
[WU FEI] Take Wing Zero?

150
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,660
[HEERO] Yeah but don't get
disillusioned by the
cockpit system.

151
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:29,400
[WU FEI] Tell me Heero why
are you doing this?

152
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:35,660
[HEERO] While you're piloting
the Zero it'll tell you who
your true enemies are.

153
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:38,460
Well let's give it a try.

154
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,200
Are you sure about
lending him the Zero?

155
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:48,330
All the Gundams were built based
on the Zero suit. He has the
right to pilot it.

156
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:55,660
Come on Zero show me what you
got! Let's see just
what you can do...

157
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,860
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

158
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:02,400
Ah!

159
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:12,300
The road I'm taking is the
correct choice.

160
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:17,491
If you're telling me that I'm
wrong

161
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:21,800
then use all the power
you've got and try
and stop me...

162
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:30,060
Ugh... Ah...

163
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,000
Ugh! Oh no!

164
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:43,930
I can fight on my own! I'll keep
on fighting alone until
the day I die!

165
00:15:43,930 --> 00:15:47,260
Is that Treize?

166
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,260
[WU FEI] Zechs?

167
00:15:56,460 --> 00:15:59,060
[EXPLOSION]

168
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:03,660
[SCREAMS]

169
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:09,660
[ZECHS] The Earth's World Nation
is claiming that unity
will achieve peace.

170
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:15,530
I never dreamed that I'd hear
such rubbish from Treize. I'm
sure that none of you have

171
00:16:15,530 --> 00:16:21,000
forgotten about an organization
that existed on Earth called
the Allied Forces

172
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:26,000
of the United Earth Sphere
Alliance. Now did that
ridiculous organization

173
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:31,060
eliminate wars and make world
peace a reality? Of
course it didn't.

174
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:36,430
Under the guise of peace and
justice the alliance came
to the colonies

175
00:16:36,430 --> 00:16:41,500
with its overwhelming military
force. If we truly want to
eradicate wars it cannot

176
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:47,330
be achieved by simply uniting
nations. It's a problem that
requires an end to

177
00:16:47,330 --> 00:16:52,830
earthlings. Because as we all
know earthlings have
fought since ancient

178
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:58,030
times when our ancestors first
stood upright. Battles
between human races

179
00:16:58,030 --> 00:17:03,330
eventually became battles
between countries and over
thousands of years

180
00:17:03,330 --> 00:17:08,000
since the dawn of time we have
continued to write our
bloodstained history.

181
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,000
There's no reason for this other
than the simple fact
that fighting

182
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,800
is a part of human nature.
[TREIZE] Milliardo....
you're not mistaken.

183
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:22,000
Then we have no choice but to
give up? No that's far
from the truth.

184
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:27,000
That's because there are some
human beings that
possess the power to

185
00:17:27,000 --> 00:17:31,300
overcome their own base
instincts. [RELENA] Milliardo...

186
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,800
No way! I wanna keep fighting!

187
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:49,000
[ZECHS] I'm sure you've noticed
by now. The citizens of
the colonies are a

188
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,860
new breed of humans. With the
ability to gain true peace by

189
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:59,000
controlling their instincts to
battle. The colony citizens
have lived their

190
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,060
lives in space where earthlings
aren't welcome. And the
people of space know

191
00:18:04,060 --> 00:18:09,800
through experience just how
meaningless these
tragic battles are.

192
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:18,130
[WU FEI] Is that my future?

193
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,660
With them?

194
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:33,400
So my path will become the
same as theirs?

195
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,150
[ZECHS] Understand that the
colony citizens are
preoccupied with just living

196
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:44,600
in outer space and they don't
have the ability to fight. Then
why did we stand up

197
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:49,330
on their behalf? Because the old
breed of mankind who
loves to battle

198
00:18:49,330 --> 00:18:54,530
remains on their comfortable
Earth &amp; tries to conquer the
defenseless colonies.

199
00:18:54,530 --> 00:19:00,000
It has been 200 years now since
our people started living in
space. Isn't it about time

200
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:05,600
that we put an end to this
history filled with disputes? To
accomplish that we have

201
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:11,600
to eliminate the hotbed of all
these battles: The place
we call Earth.

202
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:26,600
My enemies are Milliardo
Peacecraft and Treize
Khushrenada. I will defeat them.

203
00:19:26,800 --> 00:19:30,060
That's what I must do.

204
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:34,130
Of course we don't intend to
kill needlessly.

205
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:39,800
We have no choice but to fight
him. At the very least we can
say we rate humanity

206
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:42,800
a little higher than he does.

207
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:47,860
With this in mind I once again
announce to Treize Khushrenada,

208
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,500
sovereign of the World Nation,
that we demand the Earth

209
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:57,500
be eliminated from the universe.
If you cannot abide
by this demand

210
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,400
we'll have no choice but to
start a war to end all wars.

211
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:05,600
[HEERO] You're back early. Zero
showed me something
quite amusing.

212
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:07,400
[HEERO] Is that so?

213
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:11,330
I've decided I'm going to join
you. It seems like it would
be the best way

214
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:16,330
for me to defeat both Zechs and
Treize. ‐ Wu Fei...

215
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Now get the Libra started.
‐ Roger!

216
00:20:23,260 --> 00:20:25,800
[BEEP] Huh?

217
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,460
What? [SOLDIER] It's an
unidentified shuttle.

218
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:33,800
How should we handle it?

219
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:37,200
[DOROTHY] This is Dorothy
Catalonia. Hello
Milliardo Peacecraft.

220
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:41,660
It's such a pleasure to see you
again. I hope you
remember how you and I

221
00:20:41,660 --> 00:20:45,930
played with Mr. Treize back when
we were just children.

222
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:47,800
Fire. [SOLDIER] Huh?

223
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:52,060
[ZECHS] That shuttle belongs to
Romefeller. Shoot it down.

224
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:53,660
[SOLIDER] Roger.

225
00:20:55,060 --> 00:21:00,400
Once upon a time there was a
person with two names. That
person was the direct heir

226
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:06,000
of a pacifist nation but he wore
a mask and changed his name
to take revenge

227
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:12,000
against those responsible for
the nation's collapse. He
soon became the

228
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:17,400
legendary hero of an army. Today
that person says he will
punish foolish

229
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,500
earthlings. What has made
him go this far?

230
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:26,530
And can one call this an act of
pacifism? Or are these the
instincts of a hero?

231
00:21:26,530 --> 00:21:28,530
[SOLDIER] We're locked
onto the target.

232
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:34,200
It's possible that this person
actually dislikes pacifism. Or
maybe he dislikes

233
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:40,200
his sister who keeps believing
in their father's pacifist ways.
I guess nobody

234
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:45,330
really knows what his true
intentions are. I want to be
with you Mr. Milliardo.

235
00:21:45,330 --> 00:21:53,000
I want to imprint this war on my
memory. After all this is going
to be the final battle.

236
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:56,800
Alright then. Escort Ms. Dorothy
in. [SOLDIER] Huh?!

237
00:21:56,800 --> 00:22:01,800
[DOROTHY] Thank you very much
Mr. Milliardo. I promise to
never leave your side

238
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,000
under any circumstances.

White Fang to put an end to
the warring history

243
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:50,000
of mankind. But very few know
his real intentions.

other Gundam pilots
watch in horror

a foolish act.
