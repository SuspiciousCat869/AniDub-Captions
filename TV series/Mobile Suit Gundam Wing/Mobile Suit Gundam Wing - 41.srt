He’s much too strong for us.

That’s why we’ve got him tied down
in restraints like that.

to unbuckle him.

the data on Gundam...

...that it would have to be this
big to maintain it’s power.

290
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,680
It was determined that this size
exceeded their needs...

291
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:09,220
...and thus the present Mobile
Suit size became standardized.

they called it.

compete with the Gundam
