2
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:32,800
Colonel!

00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,060
[NARRATOR:]
Grief‐stricken Quatre

4
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,220
Hey! Look at that!

5
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:05,980
Huh?

6
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:07,660
It's an Alliance mobile suit.

7
00:02:28,020 --> 00:02:29,300
[DOCTOR:] I see you're awake.

8
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:30,760
How are you feeling?

9
00:02:31,460 --> 00:02:34,260
This is a satellite for
mining natural resources.

10
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,720
What were you doing in
that mobile suit, anyway?

11
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:41,120
You don't appear to be a
soldier with the Alliance.

12
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,400
I'm not!

13
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,860
Keep still! Don't try to move.

14
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:48,200
If you'd continued drifting into
space, you’d be dead by now.

15
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,780
I don’t understand.

16
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:53,760
Why did you bother trying
to save my life?

17
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,120
I'm a doctor.

18
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,340
Nothing to do with OZ
or the Alliance.

19
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:01,580
Besides, this is a neutral zone
outside both group's control.

20
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,100
Please forgive me.

21
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,860
I didn't even say thanks
for saving my life.

22
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,900
Do you have any idea where I
could try and rent a
shuttle from?

23
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:11,840
You mustn't!

24
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,060
I can't afford to let a patient
in your condition out
of my sight.

25
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:16,800
Forget about my condition!

26
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,800
Try to calm down.

27
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,540
I can see you're in a hurry, but
it's just not good
for your health!

28
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:27,520
What you really need to do right
now is rest your body and mind.

29
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:33,220
I can make arrangements
for the shuttle you want.

30
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,500
But promise me that you'll wait?

31
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,660
Yeah.

32
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:37,660
Sorry to be asking you favors.

33
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:39,420
Not a problem at all.

34
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:41,800
But you have to promise to rest.

35
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:43,120
See ya.

36
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,180
[NICHOL:] It’s no use.

37
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,460
The target is
accelerating even more.

38
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:57,160
The Leos can't keep up with it.

39
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:00,540
The route is unchanged, it’s
still headed for the Bay Area.

40
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:03,460
The Leos are no match;
I thought so.

41
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,491
We’ve received
confirmation of reports

42
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,320
that it might even be
the Tallgeese.

43
00:04:07,320 --> 00:04:08,880
I don't care what it is!

44
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:13,160
We can't allow a mobile suit
with weapons to get in
too close to us.

45
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:15,860
We can probably get rid of
it with the mobile dolls.

46
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,860
However.

47
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,030
I’ve just received word

48
00:04:19,030 --> 00:04:21,583
that the scientists have
completed the new mobile suits

49
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,120
and both of them are
ready to go.

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,433
I'd like to test the abilities

51
00:04:25,433 --> 00:04:27,400
of both the Vayeate and
the Mercurius.

52
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,900
We can't test them in real
battle, you fool!

53
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,820
Who do you recommend for
the other pilot?

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:35,640
Colonel Une, you must allow
me to pilot it.

55
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:38,740
It's got be an excellent pilot
for us to conduct a
complete test.

56
00:04:38,740 --> 00:04:40,400
Otherwise he'll just
get in the way.

57
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:41,940
What's that?

58
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,320
I understand.

59
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:44,180
Colonel!

60
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,300
Trowa Barton.

61
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,840
You've got command to
destroy the Tallgeese.

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,540
Ma'am.

63
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,500
Come out!

64
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:13,820
What do you think?

65
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:17,440
Well, how do you like the
Vayeate and Mercurius?

66
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,520
They're excellent!

67
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:21,560
They certainly reflect your
skills as Gundam designers.

68
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:25,020
It was easy. You were right to
leave things in our hands.

69
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,500
But it’s too dangerous!

70
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,880
Why on Earth are you letting
that Gundam pilot operate
the Mercurius?

71
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,200
Because he is a Gundam pilot.

72
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,620
OZ should know better than
anyone else what his skills
are like as a pilot.

73
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:39,048
You say the Mercurius'
self‐detonation device

74
00:05:39,048 --> 00:05:41,100
can be activated from
Trowa's Vayeate?

75
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,680
[DOCTOR J:] Yes, I set it up
as you requested.

76
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:46,476
Trowa, you have the authority
to blow up Mercurius

77
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:49,040
if your pilot acts even the
least bit suspicious.

78
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,840
I don’t think that will
be necessary.

79
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,560
He fought against the Tallgeese
before when he was
up in Siberia.

80
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,400
He'd think of this as
finishing the battle.

81
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,233
And this time, it’s not likely

82
00:06:00,233 --> 00:06:03,180
he’d let the colonies get in the
way of his finishing the job.

83
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:06,200
How could you have found
out about that?

84
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:09,740
It's not hard to find out, since
I'm a soldier for OZ.

85
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,980
It's a good thing he
self‐detonated in the end.

86
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:16,880
I was living in the colony at
the time and I might not have
made it out alive.

87
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,620
I’m grateful myself.

88
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:20,493
Otherwise I wouldn’t
have come across

89
00:06:20,493 --> 00:06:22,460
such an excellent
subordinate as you are.

90
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,080
How is it?

91
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,540
It’s not too bad.

92
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:58,220
The operations are practically
identical to the Gundams'.

93
00:06:58,220 --> 00:06:59,640
That’s not surprising.

94
00:07:01,700 --> 00:07:03,020
[TROWA:] Hey, Gundam pilot.

95
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:04,780
How would you fight a
mobile doll?

96
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,968
[HEERO:] First I'd sneak
behind the enemy

97
00:07:12,968 --> 00:07:15,320
to make sure I was right out
of its target range.

98
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,220
[TROWA:] Hey, hey, don’t overdo
it, or I’ll have to blow you up,
Heero.

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,373
[HEERO:] The weak point of
the mobile dolls

100
00:07:28,373 --> 00:07:31,720
is that the basic capabilities
are the same as the
manned models.

101
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:35,500
They're identical, right down to
their mobility and
reaction times.

102
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:38,740
The rest depends on how well a
human pilot can fight them.

103
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,840
Personally, I have a harder
time with space mines.

104
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,680
We don't need the mobile dolls.

105
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,960
I'll handle that white
suit on my own.

106
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:54,780
[TROWA:] We've caught up
with the target.

107
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:56,280
We'll send the mobile
dolls ahead of us.

108
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:08,100
What could he be in
outer space for?

109
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,720
You got me.

110
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,700
It’s the mobile dolls!

111
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:35,380
My reaction time is
slower than theirs.

112
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,920
But I can make up for that in
close‐range combat.

113
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,300
What?

114
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:04,520
There's two of them!

115
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:12,700
It reflected the beam!

116
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,420
Gotta move in on this one too!

117
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:06,840
They're destroying the mobile
dolls at the same time
they're fighting me.

118
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:12,100
I can’t imagine there’d be many
pilots who'd be able to do
that in outer space.

119
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:16,280
[ZECHS:] I haven't got time to
be playing games with you.

120
00:10:16,280 --> 00:10:18,020
Just go ahead and haul me in.

121
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:29,080
Never would've guessed
you'd sneak into OZ.

122
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,260
I'm officer Trowa Barton.

123
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,140
I don't believe we've met, have
we, Zechs Merquise?

124
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,420
I'll introduce myself.

125
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:45,300
I go by the name
Milliardo Peacecraft.

126
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:49,540
I've come from Earth to visit
you as a goodwill ambassador.

127
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:06,978
[NARRATOR:] The majority of
people living in space

128
00:11:06,978 --> 00:11:08,980
are either
technicians or laborers.

129
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:12,845
Enduring an environment inferior
to that of the stable Earth,

130
00:11:12,845 --> 00:11:16,750
these people have strong spirits
to improve their conditions,

131
00:11:16,750 --> 00:11:18,800
which gives rise to a new power.

132
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,820
The foundation that supports
this spirit, is the
Winner family.

133
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,995
The present master of the Winner
family immigrated to the colony,

134
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,585
and became the central
figure in negotiations

135
00:11:30,585 --> 00:11:32,721
with the United Earth
Sphere Alliance

136
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:35,400
to fight for the right of the
colony residents.

137
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:39,315
Even now, after the
disintegration of the
Alliance Military,

138
00:11:39,315 --> 00:11:41,960
he confronts OZ on behalf
of the colony,

139
00:11:41,960 --> 00:11:44,080
but always acting as a pacifist.

140
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:47,320
Excuse me a minute, Mr. Winner.

141
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,740
[MR. WINNER:] What?

142
00:11:50,340 --> 00:11:51,980
Quatre has come back home?

143
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:55,820
[IREA:] How old were you
in that picture?

144
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,245
I really appreciate your
going to the trouble

145
00:11:59,245 --> 00:12:00,700
of bringing me all the way here.

146
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,260
It wasn't any trouble at all.

147
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,980
I needed to come here anyway.

148
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:05,960
Quatre.

149
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:13,060
You've been very disobedient.

150
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,740
I still believe that I did
the right thing!

151
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:19,600
We humans have great difficulty
simply living in outer space!

152
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:23,100
Nothing good can come of
involving yourself in a war!

153
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:26,756
That's exactly why we've been
searching for solutions
all this time

154
00:12:26,756 --> 00:12:30,140
through our discussions with the
s United Earth Sphere Alliance.

155
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,558
But that wasn’t good
enough for you.

156
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:34,530
You had to go to Earth in
a mobile suit,

157
00:12:34,530 --> 00:12:37,500
and you provided them with an
excuse to attack the colonies.

158
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,980
But someone has to fight
otherwise this war will
never come to an end.

159
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,300
Well? Has it ended?

160
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,680
Did your battle end the war?

161
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,320
What could you accomplish?

162
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,160
What could a child like
you accomplish?

163
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,420
The least you could do as an
heir is listen to what your
father has to say.

164
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,420
Why don’t you use your
head a little?

165
00:12:58,420 --> 00:13:01,180
I think he'll grown up to be
an excellent heir.

166
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:03,400
Irea, don't you go
starting in on me now.

167
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,620
Really, father.

168
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:07,720
It's wrong to think of a child
as being completely incapable.

169
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:11,660
I think my dear little brother
is going to make an
excellent heir!

170
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,485
[IREA:] Deep inside,

171
00:13:17,485 --> 00:13:20,281
Father understands that holding
discussions with OZ

172
00:13:20,281 --> 00:13:21,820
won't lead to any solutions.

173
00:13:21,820 --> 00:13:24,378
But he thinks things will
come out all right

174
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:26,820
if the whole colony works
together as one.

175
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:29,800
Why didn't you tell me that
you were my sister?

176
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,900
I'd heard from Father that my
little brother had become
a Gundam pilot.

177
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:36,040
But you saw how upset he gets.

178
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,880
I couldn't decide whether or not
I should say anything.

179
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,760
And I heard my sisters were
stationed in different
resource satellites.

180
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:44,840
We're all rooting for you,
Quatre.

181
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:47,800
And Father was no exception.

182
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:54,620
Right after you left on your
own, it was Father who the most
worried about you.

183
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:56,240
Really?

184
00:13:58,680 --> 00:14:03,200
It's true, I gave refuge to
Instructor H who was running
from the Alliance.

185
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:05,771
But from the Winner
family's perspective,

186
00:14:05,771 --> 00:14:09,220
mobile suits aren't necessary in
order to attain peace.

187
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:13,320
Still, Quatre ignored me and
cooperated with the instructor.

188
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:29,000
Aggressive solutions can only
give rise to even more problems.

189
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:32,400
But Quatre just can't see that.

190
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,940
[QUATRE:] This is where my
Gundam was built.

191
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:44,070
But I ended up having to
destroy it back on Earth

192
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,520
because of my incompetence.

193
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,660
What are you about to do?

194
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:50,340
The instructor's not here.

195
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:53,240
But I have to make a Gundam
again in order to fight.

196
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,740
Quatre.

197
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:58,840
Can you really fight for the
people of the colony?

198
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:00,920
Huh?

199
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:03,845
Another Gundam pilot who
fought like you

200
00:15:03,845 --> 00:15:08,160
was caught and his Gundam was
destroyed in front of everyone
to set an example.

201
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,580
The people of the colonies saw
this and celebrated.

202
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,860
There just aren’t any people
left in space who think of the
Gundams their allies.

203
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:19,560
Quatre, are you sure you
can still fight?

204
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:24,480
I wasn't fighting so my deeds
would be recognized
by the people.

205
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:27,150
One day they'll come to
see the truth.

206
00:15:27,150 --> 00:15:29,220
I truly believe that’s
gonna happen.

207
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:36,220
I guess I’m probably feeling a
little sentimental without
Sandrock around.

208
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:38,900
I'm sorry, Quatre.

209
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:42,680
I'm your sister, and all I seem
to say to you are mean things.

much we all love you.

sad, my dearest little Quatre.

[COLONIST:] The people of OZ
will no longer suffer the
Winner family!

Then how would you gentlemen
define development
for our future?

217
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:05,720
Why do you need
defense armaments?

218
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:08,400
Mr. Winner, I understand
your point of view,

219
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,520
but we're already in a dangerous
strategic position.

220
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:15,220
And the people want to be
responsible for maintaining
their own safety.

221
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:16,340
Safety?

222
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,660
This is safety?

223
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,218
After seeing these weapons,
you armed yourselves,

224
00:16:20,218 --> 00:16:23,300
so how dare you use words like
“safety” or “peace”!

225
00:16:23,300 --> 00:16:26,000
Development of this colony
wouldn't have been possible

226
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,000
without your financial help, Mr.
Winner.

227
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,420
However the current prosperity
is a direct result of the
citizens' efforts.

228
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:35,340
I question the need for your
continued dictatorship.

229
00:16:35,340 --> 00:16:37,560
When did I ever act
as a dictator?

230
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:42,120
All I’ve done is object to OZ's
intervention to maintain
the colony’s peace.

231

dictate the colony then

exclusive control over us, sir.

Please, let us all move forward

jurisdiction over this area.

What you’re suggesting is the
manufacture of weapons
and murder tools,

cooperate with that?

The public opinion is
getting stronger.

241

They say we shouldn't have all
the natural resources.

242
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:31,720
That's absurd.

243

It's true that the Winner family
owns many natural
resource satellites.

But we've never
monopolized the resources.

We've practically given them
away for the prosperity of
