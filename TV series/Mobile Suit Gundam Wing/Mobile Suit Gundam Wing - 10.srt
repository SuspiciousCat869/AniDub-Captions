00:01:24,700 --> 00:01:25,980
What's this?

3
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:28,200
Are...are you telling
me to get off?

4
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,480
Thank you Sandrock!

5
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:40,780
I thank you, my dear Sandrock.

[NARRATOR: Tallgeese Destroyed]

7
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:21,340
[OZ SOLDIER:] We've
confirmed the engineers' identity.

8
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,540
[LADY UNE:] All five of them?

9
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:24,720
[OZ SOLDIER:] Yes, ma'am.

10
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,740
As suspected, they
were all involved

11
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:29,100
in developing OZ mobile
suits in the past.

12
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:31,040
[LADY UNE:] Is that right?

13
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,340
[OZ SOLDIER:] All five of them

14
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,460
disappeared during the
development of the Tallgeese.

15
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:35,430
Or more accurately,

16
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,645
since completion of the Tallgeese
blueprint,

17
00:02:37,813 --> 00:02:39,160
and have been missing
since.

18
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,880
[LADY UNE:] Tallgeese?

19
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,530
Isn't that the mobile suit

20
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,480
Colonel Zechs is using that’s
also called the Leo Prototype?

21
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:49,040
[OZ SOLDIER:] Yes, it
was built twenty years ago.

22
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,308
But it's still regarded as the

23
00:02:50,476 --> 00:02:51,920
most powerful mobile suit on
Earth.

24
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,780
Most powerful is hardly the
appropriate term, now is it?

25
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,560
[OZ SOLDIER:] Ma'am?

26
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,491
It wouldn't be the most powerful

27
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:01,080
unless all soldiers described it
as such.

28
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,820
We'll have them make us a suit.

29
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:07,800
A mobile suit that's more
powerful than the Tallgeese.

30
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:10,240
No, more powerful
than the Gundams!

31
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:21,720
Captain, sir, I’ve brought Colonel
Zechs here to see you, sir.

32
00:03:21,886 --> 00:03:23,073
[OZ CAPTAIN:]
Thank you.

33
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,380
You’ll have to excuse
the small room.

34
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,840
Please, have a seat.

35
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,740
[OZ CAPTAIN:] You don't
need that for Colonel Zechs.

36
00:03:29,906 --> 00:03:30,711
[SOLDIERS IN UNISON:] Huh?

37
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,940
You're dismissed.

38
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,880
[KHUSHRENADA:] Sorry to
make you uncomfortable, Zechs.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,040
Don't concern yourself,
Your Excellency.

40
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,720
I am prepared to face a
court martial.

41
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,770
[KHUSHRENADA:] As long
as you continue

42
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,120
to be a strong force
for the Romefeller Foundation,

43
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:52,000
I see no problems with
the court martial.

44
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,780
[ZECHS:] A strong force?

45
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,708
Right now, the Romefeller
Foundation

46
00:03:56,876 --> 00:03:58,580
is concerned about the Gundams:

47
00:03:58,580 --> 00:04:00,820
the most powerful mobile
suits on Earth.

48
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:03,210
Would you continue to
fight as our knight

49
00:04:03,210 --> 00:04:05,380
to defeat the Gundams,
Colonel Zechs?

50
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,520
[ZECHS:] Your Excellency.

51
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,630
I'm sorry to say this,

52
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:09,476
but I don't believe I can follow
the

53
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:11,700
Romefeller Foundation’s ideas any
longer.

54
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,500
[KHUSHRENADA:] What?

55
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,370
[ZECHS:] I've been
fighting the Gundams

56
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:15,580
out of personal feelings.

57
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:18,340
And that's something
which has no place in a war.

58
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,980
My battle with the
Gundams is over.

59
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:23,300
[KHUSHRENADA:] I see.

60
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:26,540
In that case, Zechs,
sacrifice your life for OZ.

61
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,430
[KHUSHRENADA:] A guilty
verdict in court

62
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,500
for your conduct would be a
big blow to OZ.

63
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,030
But if you died an
honorable death during battle,

64
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,730
many soldiers would
mourn your death

65
00:04:35,730 --> 00:04:37,480
and develop a stronger
will to fight.

66
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,460
Naturally, the higher powers
in the Romefeller Foundation

67
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,200
will also be satisfied with this.

68
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,380
The name Lightning Count will
live on as a legendary hero.

69
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:46,540
That'd be wonderful.

70
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,940
[KHUSHRENADA:] Your death
would have that much value to it.

71
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,340
If you died, you'd be free.

72
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,960
Farewell, Zechs Merquise.

73
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:02,780
Once everyone has left this ship,

74
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,740
fifty Aries and twenty Cancers
are scheduled to attack it.

75
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:07,530
[OZ CAPTAIN:] They'll be manned

76
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:09,960
by Alliance survivors trying to
win the Foundation's attention.

77
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,310
I heard this mission is
to allow you to escape

78
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:13,900
unnoticed by the higher powers.

79
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,900
But given the enemy and
the sheer numbers,

80
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,200
there's no room for escape.

81
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,900
[ZECHS:] That's right.

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,070
This is a test in order to

83
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:23,680
survive as Treize's friend.

84
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,280
No matter what I do,

85
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,360
I’m not able to escape from
what he has planned for me.

86
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:32,660
[TUBAROV:] Commence simulation!

87
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,300
[DERMAIL:] So this is the
mobile doll system.

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,600
We used an old model of the Leo.

89
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,940
So we’re having to program
them from a distance.

90
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:59,620
But no such problem exists
with our Taurus space mobile doll.

91
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:01,440
Wonderful abilities.

92
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:03,750
These would reinforce our
soldiers,

93
00:06:03,918 --> 00:06:05,860
would they not, Chief Engineer?

94
00:06:05,860 --> 00:06:09,340
In fact, they'll replace soldiers
as the main force in the future.

95
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,100
[DERMAIL:] What's that?

96
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:14,420
[OZ SOLDIER:] Someone's
attacking us!

97
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,820
But they're not responding!

98
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:16,650
Order to attack!

99
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,120
It’s the perfect target for
the mobile dolls.

100
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,960
Enemy spy. How foolish!

101
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:26,780
Sir, transmission from
the enemy Leo!

102
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:29,000
[OZ SOLDIER:] It’s Colonel Treize!

103
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:29,420
[TUBAROV:] What?!

104
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,360
[OZ SOLDIER:] Discontinue attack!
Stop firing!

105
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:36,160
I thought I would
represent human soldiers

106
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,280
and come here to propose
a battle against the mobile dolls.

107
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,780
[TUBAROV:] Are you trying to
kill yourself, Colonel Treize?

108
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:43,760
Mobile dolls show no mercy!

109
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,400
If mobile dolls are superior,

110
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,960
then there’s no place for
me in this world.

111
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,040
I think we could vie for
superiority here and now.

112
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:52,080
Here goes.

113
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,440
He's insane!

114
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,160
Never mind, attack the
Colonel and kill him!

115
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,060
[OZ SOLDIER:] Sir?

116
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,240
[TUBAROV:] That’s an order!

117
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,520
He's trying to kill us!

118
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,960
Go ahead! Get him!

119
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,260
[OZ SOLDIER:] No! I can't!

120
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:05,700
[TUBAROV:] Then I’ll do it myself!

121
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:07,700
[OZ SOLDIER:] Stop it,
Chief Engineer!

122
00:07:07,700 --> 00:07:08,300
[TUBAROV:] Silence!

123
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:10,940
This is Treize Khushrenada.

124
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:12,940
Murder Tubarov!

125
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:13,600
Sir!

126
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:17,360
[TUBAROV:] What the hell?

127
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:26,700
No, please stop this!

128
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,166
[OZ SOLDIER:] I'm assassinating
you

129
00:07:28,335 --> 00:07:29,760
under the orders of Colonel
Treize!

130
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,380
It's over.

131
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,300
Chief Engineer Tubarov.

132
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,980
There’s a lot more to wars than
simply fighting with mobile suits.

133
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,580
[KHUSHRENADA:] We claim victory.

134
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,380
I retract my order.

135
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:44,240
Mobile dolls and soldiers both
take their orders from humans.

136
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,340
I ask that you place more
value on humans

137
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,980
and learn to love them, Tubarov.

138
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:57,060
[KHUSHRENADA:] Hurry up and
return to me, Zechs.

139
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,440
Because if you're not
around to help,

140
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,740
OZ will allow worthless
actions by worthless people.

141
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:09,181
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:] The shuttle
that

142
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,440
avoided OZ's surveillance is
coming!

143
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,780
[ALLIANCE COMMANDER:]
Just as I thought.

144
00:08:11,780 --> 00:08:14,300
This course isn't
frequented by OZ.

145
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:17,040
Then we can capture ourselves
a Gundam, isn’t that right sir?

146
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,800
More specifically, a Gundam pilot.

147
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,950
[ALLIANCE COMMANDER:]
The shuttle on its way here

148
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,760
isn't equipped for mobile
suit transport.

149
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:25,630
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:] Then
what do you plan to achieve

150
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,540
by restraining the pilot?

151
00:08:27,080 --> 00:08:29,188
I’m sure the reason the Gundam
pilot

152
00:08:29,356 --> 00:08:31,820
has returned to outer space is to
fight OZ.

153
00:08:31,820 --> 00:08:33,430
We're after the same enemies,

154
00:08:33,430 --> 00:08:36,560
so I'll negotiate with the
pilot to join forces with us!

155
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:39,740
Wouldn’t it be a good idea
to hand the pilot over to OZ

156
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:42,100
in exchange for a
guarantee of our safety?

157
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,160
Vague negotiations are meaningless

158
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:48,060
with an organization that has
a record of always fighting dirty.

159
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:50,860
Our only chance is to
fight head on!

160
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,540
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:] Five
objects approaching at high speed.

161
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,820
They’re believed to be
Taurus mobile suits.

162
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,040
[ALLIANCE COMMANDER:]
Five of them?

163
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,760
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:] We have twenty
space Leos, we have the advantage!

164
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,760
[ALLIANCE COMMANDER:] I told you
not to underestimate OZ!

165
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,890
OZ already knows that no survivors

166
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,840
from the Alliance Space
Forces are hiding here!

167
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:11,280
They can defeat us, with
just five Tauruses!

168
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:13,760
We'll fight for the survival
of the Alliance.

169
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,380
Don't let them get their
hands on the Gundam pilot!

170
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:20,700
[NICHOL:] The Alliance mobile
suits are being deployed, but why?

171
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,460
[OZ SOLDIER:] Flying object is
approaching the retreating troops!

172
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,300
What?

173
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:25,740
Is it the Gundam?

174
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,460
[NICHOL:] Did these guys find
the Gundams after they left Earth?

175
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:30,630
[OZ SOLDIER:] All the enemy
suits headed here

176
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,080
are Leos for normal space battle!

177
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:33,000
[NICHOL:] Roger.

178
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:36,000
Provide the mobile dolls
with all target information.

179
00:09:36,060 --> 00:09:37,380
Take over from here.

180
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:38,740
[NICHOL:] I'm going
after the shuttle!

181
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:39,540
[OZ SOLDIER:] Yes, sir!

182
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,360
[DOCTOR J:] So, now they can
utilize unmanned mobile suits.

183
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,960
[PROFESSOR G:] They
probably saw them

184
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,300
as valid weapons since
outer space has no obstacles.

185
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,600
[DOCTOR J:] Battling people
without getting your hands dirty

186
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:06,820
is nothing but a game.

187
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,060
Foolish are those who start wars.

188
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:11,840
But the blood shed during
battle is never a waste.

189
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:14,120
[PROFESSOR G:] Foolish
people see the bloodshed

190
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:16,240
and learn to regret
their actions just a little.

191
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,120
But once war turns into a game

192
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,380
it becomes mere
entertainment to them.

193
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,910
[DOKTOR S:] Actually I wish
they'd just declare a winner

194
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:23,500
to this game.

195
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:25,760
So that way nobody
would have to die.

196
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:28,200
Assuming the opponent has
the technology.

197
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,980
We all have the technology!

198
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:32,830
But soldiers sense the
responsibilities of combat

199
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,060
if he doesn’t use
automated functions!

200
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:36,320
You've got the technology?

201
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,380
Looks like you guys could
earn yourselves

202
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:40,140
the right to live
longer after all.

203
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:41,740
[INSTRUCTOR H:] I can't do it.

204
00:10:41,740 --> 00:10:44,540
I'd rather die than
construct such a thing.

205
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,483
[MASTER O:] Youngsters always
want to

206
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:47,900
think things out
rationally.

207
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:50,800
But war itself is
anything but rational.

208
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:54,220
[LADY UNE:] And here I was
going to give you the chance

209
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,826
to build a mobile suit superior to
the Tallgeese

210
00:10:56,995 --> 00:10:58,120
and Gundams you
built.

211
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,260
Go ahead and kill us!

212
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:01,470
I have no intentions of
lending a hand

213
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:03,920
in an empty war drawn out
on a game board.

214
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,200
Negotiations are over.

215
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,820
Colonel.

216
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,160
Chief Officer Nichol
is on the line.

217
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:12,500
What is it, Nichol?

218
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,620
[NICHOL:] I’ve intercepted
the Alliance's transmission

219
00:11:14,620 --> 00:11:17,060
and found out they’re planning
to team up with a Gundam pilot!

220
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:22,300
Those imbeciles, go ahead
and wipe out the lot of them!

221
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:23,420
[NICHOL:] Yes, ma 'am!

222
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,300
They're fast!

223
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,420
Five suits at once?

224
00:11:55,020 --> 00:11:57,130
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:]
The enemy mobile suit speed

225
00:11:57,130 --> 00:11:58,120
has accelerated to 8G!

226
00:11:58,120 --> 00:12:01,000
What kind of superhuman
could be piloting that?

227
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,240
[NICHOL:] Alliance main forces
have been demolished!

228
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,800
We'll move on to
seize the shuttle!

229
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,860
[LADY UNE:] Seize?

230
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:15,620
What's the point of that?

231
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:19,031
We’ve got no need a Gundam pilot
without his Gundam.

232
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,100
Get rid of
him!

233
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:20,720
[NICHOL:] Roger!

234
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,540
Wait!

235
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,180
Hand me the communication system.

236
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,180
Okay, sure.

237
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:34,760
[QUATRE:] This is Quatre.

238
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,680
My good friends who have
returned to outer space.

239
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:42,220
Together, let us do our very best
to protect the space colonies.

240
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,140
[DOCTOR J:] He's using
Heero's frequency.

241
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,240
He's an outstanding soldier.

242
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:51,400
He has the ability to bring the
five Gundam pilots together.

243
00:12:54,900 --> 00:12:57,960
This is Quatre. Quatre speaking.

244
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,200
My good friends who have
returned to outer space.

245
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,380
Together, let's do our very
best to protect the colonies.

246
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:08,160
Tell them to stop firing
at the shuttle!

247
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:09,520
[LADY UNE:] Well, well.

248
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,940
So you did have the heart
to pity your men.

249
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:13,940
Then I guess we have an
understanding now.

250
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:17,440
Who'd have thought we'd end up
having to make a Gundam for OZ?

251
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,740
Not exactly.

252
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,480
I am telling you to make a mobile
suit better than the Gundams.

253
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,400
He's just a kid!

254
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,600
[ALLIANCE COMMANDER:]
This is a Gundam pilot?

255
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,180
But he's so young!

256
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,180
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:] Captain!

257
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,340
All the Tauruses are
headed this way!

258
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,220
That's fast.

259
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:51,500
Engage them as far away
from the shuttle as possible!

260
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,440
[ALLIANCE SOLDIER:] Roger!

261
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,260
[ALLIANCE COMMANDER:] I'm not
gonna let you die.

262
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:58,780
[NICHOL:] We've caught up
with the shuttle!

263
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,220
[OZ COMMANDER:]
Stop your attack on the shuttle!

264
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:02,440
All Taurus units, move away
from the shuttle's route!

265
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,240
What was that?

266
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,480
Stop our attack?

267
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,880
Orders are to leave the
shuttle alone.

268
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:10,240
We're all free to roam
about in space.

269
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,620
But we must get rid of the
garbage we find along the routes.

270
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,480
Nichol.

271
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,140
Blow it up, of course.

272
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:17,700
Roger that, Colonel.

273
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,420
[NICHOL:] I’ll leave the
space Leos to you,

274
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,660
I’m heading after the shuttle!

275
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,660
[EXPLOSIONS]

276
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:38,100
Still no word from the shuttle.

277
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,100
So I’m gonna commence to
clean up the route!

278
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,560
[NICHOL:] What?

279
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,980
The shuttle just fired at a Leo!

280
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:49,260
[NICHOL:] There’s life
on the shuttle!

281
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:51,260
All suits, destroy the shuttle!

282
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:53,780
Fire!

283
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,190
Our forces alone don't
have the power

284
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,340
to retaliate against OZ right now.

285
00:15:04,340 --> 00:15:07,520
But I'm sure that young
pilot is capable of doing it.

286
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:11,000
I certainly hope my
instincts prove to be right.

287

[EXPLOSION]

Together.

00:15:26,780 --> 00:15:29,360
Let's protect outer space.

Your ride has arrived.

292
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:40,560
How did repairs on the
Tallgeese go, sir?

293
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:43,920
Thanks to your all your people's
help, everything's in order.

Thank you.

[OZ SOLDIER:] The radar's
picking up objects

from point 0430 behind us!

298

[OZ CAPTAIN:] They're here.

Just in time!

00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,280
Which means they're gonna
sink this ship.

I'm sorry.

Give it your best shot, sir.

303

I don't know what to think right
now,
but, Colonel: win this battle!

Fifty Aries and twenty Cancers.

309

I'll just have to prove to them

310
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:53,110
that they seriously underestimated

00:16:53,110 --> 00:16:54,340
the value of my life.

312
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:22,540
How many more?

00:17:45,540 --> 00:17:46,580
Nice move!

00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,760
will only last until the
day my mask breaks.

319
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,060
And now, I cannot be your
friend any more.

320
00:18:54,220 --> 00:18:55,900
[ZECHS:] Farewell, Treize.

321
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:01,210
[HEERO:] Earth.

322
00:19:01,210 --> 00:19:04,310
The planet in the solar system
that miraculously

323
00:19:04,478 --> 00:19:05,720
gave birth to
life.

324
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:08,480
In the year After Colony 195,

325
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,860
with the development of
the colonies,

326
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,180
people now live in new
surroundings.

327
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:15,356
Thanks to plentiful natural
resources

328
00:19:15,525 --> 00:19:17,760
and cultivated technological
abilities.

329
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,250
However, this new world
is nothing but an imitation

330
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,520
of humankind's motherland,
the Earth.

331
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,140
But why were the colonies
made in the first place?

332
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:31,170
I hear the main purpose was
technological development

333
00:19:31,170 --> 00:19:33,700
to improve the lives
of humankind on Earth.

334
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,980
Did humankind start
asking for too much

335
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,720
from this imitation world?

336
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,570
The self‐sustained way of life
is more stable than life on Earth,

337
00:19:42,570 --> 00:19:45,900
especially since it lacks
the risk of natural disasters.

338
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,060
It appears that this
unlimited growth

339
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:52,500
was guaranteeing the eternal
existence of humankind.

340
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,730
Perhaps there was an age when
people

341
00:19:54,898 --> 00:19:57,210
dreamed of the possibilities in
outer space,

342
00:19:57,210 --> 00:19:59,180
where they could start
from scratch.

343
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:01,780
However, it's unthinkable
that the colonies

344
00:20:01,780 --> 00:20:04,520
or that humankind will ever
forget the Earth.

345
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:07,490
What did technological development
in the colonies

346
00:20:07,658 --> 00:20:08,580
bring to the
Earth?

347
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:12,820
The kind of technology the
Earth wants most: military power.

348
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:17,220
Destruction is a human nature
that can never be gotten rid of.

349
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,310
And now, the colonies are
developing

350
00:20:19,478 --> 00:20:20,980
a militaristic
disposition.

351
00:20:20,980 --> 00:20:23,620
The colonies cannot
forget the Earth.

352
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,320
The Earth has great beauty.

353
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:27,730
The animals known as humans

354
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:30,270
have acquired such strength
that they even think

355
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:32,660
about controlling this
planet for themselves.

356
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:36,090
From the point of view of
a planet’s life,

357
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:39,400
the life of a living thing lasts
no more than an instant.

358
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,548
But in the end, it is only
themselves

359
00:20:41,716 --> 00:20:43,100
that humans can think
of.

360
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:44,500
Nothing changes.

361
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:48,520
The time spent by humans in outer
space has been a complete waste.

362
00:20:48,520 --> 00:20:50,760
The ideal is just a dream.

363
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,100
This false pacifism.

364
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,480
This false living space.

365
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,150
Outer space is nothing but
a breeding ground

366
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,340
for even more battles
in the future.

367
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:04,120
Wars throughout history
have claimed many lives.

368
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:07,560
Although humankind hasn't
been able to forget the sorrow

369
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:11,500
that has been cause by the wars,
they have not stopped fighting.

370
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:15,880
The blood and tears they
shed are merely ceremonial.

371
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,930
One can't speak of history
without referring to the wars

372
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:21,820
in each era as important events.

373
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:24,730
I'm sure the pale pep talks of
fighting for peace

374
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,480
have been repeated
numerous times in the past.

375
00:21:28,140 --> 00:21:31,420
The colonies say they need
armaments to maintain peace.

376
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,660
It's no different from on Earth.

377
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:36,600
The colonies think
they've joined the big boys.

378
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:38,860
I guess they believed the
bloodshed

379
00:21:39,028 --> 00:21:40,440
would lead to higher morale—

380
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,780
Okay, that's enough Duo Maxwell.

381
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:44,520
Let's avoid that subject.

382
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:47,000
It's making your
classmates uncomfortable.

383
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:50,490
Personally, I don't feel it
was an appropriate subject

384
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:51,840
for your greeting speech.

385
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:54,820
Now, Duo, please take a
seat in the back.

386
00:22:00,760 --> 00:22:02,940
[HEERO:] So why do
people fight anyway?

387
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:06,980
Perhaps meaning of human existence
lies within their will to fight.

388
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,940
People feel a sense of
accomplishment through battle.

389
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:13,560
And it's also a fact that
the ones actually fighting

390
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,960
are never perceived as
being tainted.

391
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:39,140
[ENDING MUSIC]

392
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,470
[NARRATOR:] There's no
glory or praise

393
00:23:42,470 --> 00:23:45,200
for the Gundam pilots
returning to the colonies.

394
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,820
Only orders to destroy OZ.

395
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:51,660
The Gundam Deathscythe battles
the Tauruses in outer space.

396
00:23:51,660 --> 00:23:54,800
But Duo is defeated
and taken prisoner by OZ.

397
00:23:55,040 --> 00:23:57,910
In order to maintain
confidentiality,

398
00:23:57,910 --> 00:24:00,640
Heero searches for
Duo to kill him.
