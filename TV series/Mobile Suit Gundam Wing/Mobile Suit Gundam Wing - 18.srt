[DOROTHY] I want to be with you
Mr. Milliardo. I want to imprint
this war on my memory.

the final battle.

Zero showed me something quite
amusing. [HEERO] Is that so?

6
00:01:40,038 --> 00:01:46,138
I've decided I'm going to join
you. It seems like it would
be the best way

7
00:01:46,138 --> 00:01:50,938

Treize. [SALLY PO] Wu Fei...

Dorothy in.

12
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:21,630
[SOLDIER] It appears to
be a shuttle.

13

An enemy?

14
00:02:23,622 --> 00:02:28,553
No. An enemy would have started
attacking us long ago.

15

This is Peacemillion here. I
demand the approaching
shuttle respond.

there Miss Noin.

getting shot to pieces.

we stay for awhile?

No stay for as long as you like.
I'm just glad to have you guys
here visiting with us.

23

This will be one tough
battle huh Noin?

24

All battles are tough by their
nature. I'm sure you
already know that.

25
00:03:18,952 --> 00:03:25,092
Sally I feel so powerless. I may
need to depend on you quite
a bit this time.

26
00:03:25,225 --> 00:03:30,492
It won't be me you'll be
depending on. Those kids have
left their doubts behind.

27
00:03:30,558 --> 00:03:37,552
They've found their missions in
life. If you stay on their side
you won't go astray.

28
00:03:37,552 --> 00:03:40,552
Guess you're right.

29
00:03:40,552 --> 00:03:44,652
[DUO] So you brought that
troublesome suit with ya?

30
00:03:44,652 --> 00:03:48,192
You'd have to be insane to pilot
a thing like that.

31
00:03:48,225 --> 00:03:51,152
I never said you had to
pilot it. ‐ Huh?!

32
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:54,292
You piloted it though!
In that case...

33
00:03:54,292 --> 00:03:59,292
I can handle that suit. I have
experience from piloting Epyon.

34
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,592
Which has the same system on it.

35
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:08,592
Epyon? You mean the one Zechs
was on? What were you doing
piloting that thing?

36

from normal as they come.

41

you're nothing but a sitting
duck to the enemy.

returning to the battlefield.

over this colony.

What in the world?

52
00:05:34,752 --> 00:05:40,552
[NARRATOR] The surrender of the
space fortress Barge and the
lunar base was a

53
00:05:40,552 --> 00:05:46,292
blow to the OZ space force. OZ ‐
which had reigned as the leader
‐ now had no place to

54
00:05:46,292 --> 00:05:50,752
hide from White Fang and the
antipathy of the
colony citizens.

55
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:54,442
It stood isolated from
all other forces.

56
00:05:54,442 --> 00:06:00,092
[PILOT] This is a declaration to
the White Fang. We the OZ
space force have taken

57
00:06:00,092 --> 00:06:05,792
over the colony C421. We demand
that you turn over the space
battleship Libra that

58
00:06:05,792 --> 00:06:10,792
you seized from us. Should you
choose to ignore our demand
we cannot guarantee

59
00:06:10,792 --> 00:06:15,792
the safety of this colony or its
citizens. [DUO] Those
OZ guys in ...

60
00:06:15,792 --> 00:06:18,392
... space have really
lost it now.

61
00:06:18,392 --> 00:06:23,392
That's because the White Fang
has pushed them to the edge.
The White Fang didn't

62
00:06:23,392 --> 00:06:27,392
leave them a place to run. And
this is what the result is.

63
00:06:27,392 --> 00:06:32,892
Those weakling guys depend too
much on their mobile dolls. What
else do you expect?

64
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:36,625
I wonder how the White
Fang will react.

65
00:06:36,892 --> 00:06:42,292
[HEERO] The White Fang's a bunch
of weaklings too. However
Zechs will never

66
00:06:42,292 --> 00:06:47,842
go for OZ's demands. The colony
citizens will be sacrificed.

67
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:54,392
They'll lose their lives so
Zechs can win. Man can this
seriously even be called a war?

68
00:06:54,425 --> 00:06:56,692
Oh Zechs...

69
00:07:04,022 --> 00:07:07,892
Blasted OZ. Are they really
going to stop at nothing?

We can't just let the colony
citizens die sir!

71
00:07:11,352 --> 00:07:15,352
But sir we can't just hand this
battleship over to them either.

it looks like this brings
us one step closer

Doesn't it Mr. Milliardo?

What is that supposed to
mean Ms. Dorothy?

75
00:07:29,425 --> 00:07:35,292
I mean that OZ has made the
foolish choice to take the
colony citizens as hostages.

76
00:07:35,292 --> 00:07:40,152
Now the people's anger will be
directed at OZ and no
one but them.

77
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,456
But we can't just let them die.

78

C421. We'll fire the main cannon
as we change direction.

we' d kill OZ along
with the colony!

00:08:00,862 --> 00:08:06,362
This is a war we're fighting
here Mr. Quinze. If we're going
to win we must be prepared

that are necessary.

The death of the people will be
recorded in the history of
the colonies as

an honorable sacrifice necessary
to achieve our ideals. Oh

147
00:13:27,038 --> 00:13:32,105
I know. It isn't right.
Everybody's aware of that but no
one will do anything about it

148
00:13:32,105 --> 00:13:37,435
because no one wants to risk
their life. But Trowa's
different. He continually

149
00:13:37,435 --> 00:13:42,035
risks his life as he keeps
searching for the
correct path to lead.

150
00:13:42,035 --> 00:13:47,838
Otherwise he couldn't take on a
dangerous task like being
a Gundam pilot.

151
00:13:55,771 --> 00:14:01,505
[PILOT] Why has a Gundam come
here? Have they joined forces
with the White Fang?

152
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:09,705
[PILOT] If that's the case then
they've given up on this colony.
You'll regret this.

153
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:14,171
This is payback for what you
Gundams have done!

You were the one that corrected

I can't let you make
that same mistake.

Ms. Relena. But you've come too
late to make a difference.

cancel their attack!

There won't be any need. What
you guys just did was
meaningless.
