00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,406
<i>[HEERO:] In addition, Colonel</i>
<i>Une proposed a plan to transfer</i>

152
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:09,100
<i>the Taurus space mobile suits</i>
<i>to the Siberia Base.</i>

153
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,305
<i>However this was also a</i>
<i>deceptive operation,</i>

154
00:15:12,305 --> 00:15:15,320
<i>aimed at annihilating the</i>
<i>Gundams all at once.</i>

155
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,380
Do you think that the other
Gundams will come?

156
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,440
We can't win by ourselves.

157
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:23,560
But I'm positive the
others will come.

158
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:26,860
You wish!

159
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,440
He's fast!

160
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,080
<i>[ZECHS:] We'll fight for</i>
<i>recognition of superiority!</i>

161
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,760
You ARE a Gundam pilot. I'm
sure that'll suit you!

162
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,800
Who would've guessed Gundams
had this much power?

163
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,560
[UNE:] Get Space Fortress
Barge on line!

164
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,180
<i>[UNE:] Calling all</i>
<i>Gundam pilots.</i>

165
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:20,120
<i>We are now positioned to stage</i>
<i>an all out missile attack</i>
<i>on the colonies.</i>

166
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:25,480
<i>I demand all pilots to surrender</i>
<i>at once and hand over</i>
<i>your Gundams.</i>

167
00:16:25,560 --> 00:16:27,260
They've targeted the colonies!

168
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,760
And hand over our Gundams!?

169
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,580
Sounds like Oz's tricks.

170
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:35,460
You guys could fight!
Well can't you!?

171
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,120
<i>Attention OZ.</i>

172
00:16:43,620 --> 00:16:47,920
<i>I never would have imagined that</i>
<i>you people could be so</i>
<i>incredibly foolish!</i>

173
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,720
<i>In your eyes, inhumane moves</i>
<i>such as attacking the</i>
<i>colonies are just,</i>

174
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,180
<i>if that's what it takes for you</i>
<i>to come out victorious, right?</i>

175
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:59,840
<i>I surrender, but I will not</i>
<i>hand over the Gundams.</i>

176
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:04,280
<i>[DOCTOR J:] I repeat. I</i>
<i>surrender, but I will NOT hand</i>
<i>over the Gundams.</i>

177
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,500
Mission accepted.

178
00:17:42,060 --> 00:17:43,880
<i>[RELENA:] Off to</i>
<i>fight again Heero?</i>

179
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:52,000
<i>[RELENA:]The Romefeller</i>
<i>Foundation sought to maintain</i>
<i>peace through it's conquests.</i>

180
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:55,660
<i>That may be possible as long as</i>
<i>they keep winning battles.</i>

181
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:01,500
<i>[RELENA:] However, as Relena</i>
<i>Peacecraft, the present leader</i>
<i>of the Sanc Kingdom,</i>

182
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,200
<i>I cannot allow them to reign at</i>
<i>the cost of many people's lives.</i>

183
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:11,037
<i>[HEERO:] I was defeated. My</i>
<i>hands were tied since the</i>

184
00:18:11,037 --> 00:18:13,455
<i>colonies were being</i>
<i>used as a shield.</i>

185
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:17,110
<i>However, Zechs repaired my</i>
<i>Gundam in hopes that</i>

186
00:18:17,110 --> 00:18:19,880
<i>we could end our unfinished</i>
<i>battle in Siberia.</i>

187
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,040
<i>[HEERO:] The battle took</i>
<i>place in Antarctica.</i>

188
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:27,020
<i>I refused to accept</i>
<i>charity from Zechs,</i>

189
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:30,080
<i>and challenged him in Trowa's</i>
<i>Gundam Heavyarms.</i>

190
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:34,680
<i>But this battle, a battle</i>
<i>between a man looking for</i>
<i>something to protect,</i>

191
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:38,100
<i>and a man who has lost all means</i>
<i>by which to protect,</i>

192
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,020
<i>had no meaning to it.</i>

193
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,180
<i>[RELENA:] Mistakes of the past</i>
<i>are difficult for</i>
<i>anyone to swallow.</i>

194
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:04,980
<i>But we're still young. We should</i>
<i>be thinking of</i>
<i>building the future.</i>

195
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,400
<i>I wanted to put an end to this</i>
<i>meaningless fight, Heero.</i>

196
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,260
[EXPLOSION]

197
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:40,680
Has it begun?

198
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:42,760
[GUNFIRE]

199
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,180
Now that's more like it!

200
00:20:12,060 --> 00:20:13,720
<i>This will finish you off!</i>

201
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,200
Heero!

202
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:19,580
Stop this battle immediately!

203
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:23,700
<i>[ZECHS:] Just see for yourself</i>
<i>how dirty and foul</i>
<i>battles really are!</i>

204
00:20:27,380 --> 00:20:31,220
No! If you're a true warrior and
a true knight of Peacecraft,

205
00:20:31,220 --> 00:20:34,040
<i>you couldn't possibly use</i>
<i>such foul play!</i>

206
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,900
[PAGAN:] Relena! There's a call
from Lieutenant Noin!

207
00:20:37,540 --> 00:20:38,460
[RELENA:] Miss Noin.

208
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:43,420
I completely misunderstood you.
I thought you were sincere!

209
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,160
<i>Precisely. I deserve your</i>
<i>contempt but I can't help it.</i>

210
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,298
<i>Because I believe in</i>
<i>Colonel Zechs.</i>

211
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:55,300
<i>I'm not about to go interrupt</i>
<i>anything he plans on doing.</i>

212
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,040
Heero, defeat that man!

213
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,240
Stop it! Relena!

214
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,880
[NOIN:] No matter what
destiny awaits you,

215
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:09,240
you mustn't do anything as
deplorable as wishing for the
death of your own brother!

216
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,440
Brother? He's my brother?

217
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:18,680
<i>[RELENA:] I learned then, for</i>
<i>the first time that Zechs was my</i>
<i>own brother, Milliardo.</i>

218
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:22,260
<i>A number of attack carriers are</i>
<i>approaching us from 3 o'clock!</i>

219
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:23,220
They're here!

220
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:25,840
<i>[TROWA:] Can you hear me</i>
<i>Heero and Zechs?</i>

221
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,180
<i>There are about thirty</i>
<i>suits in flight!</i>

222
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,800
<i>One hundred if they unload all</i>
<i>Aries suits from the carriers.</i>

223
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,600
I'll attract them all myself!

224
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:36,200
Glory to all the colonies!

225
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:37,630
<i>[ZECHS:] Heero! We'll meet again</i>

226
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:39,240
<i>to continue our fight</i>
‐ No Zechs!!

227
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,530
<i>[HEERO:] Next time I fight him,</i>

228
00:21:41,530 --> 00:21:45,760
<i>will I be fighting against Zechs</i>
<i>Marquise or</i>
<i>Milliardo Peacecraft?</i>

229
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:50,060
<i>Whichever it may be, I'll defeat</i>
<i>him if he's going to</i>
<i>stand in my way.</i>

230
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:52,680
<i>If he's an enemy, I'll kill him.</i>

231
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:56,040
<i>[RELENA:] I haven't seen Heero,</i>
<i>or my brother since then.</i>

232
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,720
<i>Now, with OZ splitting</i>
<i>into two factions,</i>

233
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,120
<i>and continuing with their</i>
<i>foolish battle,</i>

234
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:05,300
<i>the world is proceeding along</i>
<i>the path to chaos.</i>

235
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,240
<i>[RELENA:] But I'm confident that</i>
<i>you will appear before me Heero,</i>
<i>to end this war.</i>

236
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:19,560
Heero!!! I'm waiting for you to
come back to me Heero!!
