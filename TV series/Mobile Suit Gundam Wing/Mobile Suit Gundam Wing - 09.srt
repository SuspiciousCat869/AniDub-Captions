<i>[NARRATOR:] To facilitate it's</i>
<i>reign over the world,</i>

3
00:01:38,725 --> 00:01:41,393
<i>Romefeller Foundation</i>
<i>promoted a new Oz,</i>

4
00:01:41,393 --> 00:01:44,705
<i>with it's main power consisting of</i>
<i>unmanned units</i>

5
00:01:44,873 --> 00:01:46,148
<i>called mobile</i>
<i>dolls.</i>

6
00:01:46,148 --> 00:01:48,640
<i>Certain changes within the</i>
<i>Foundation</i>

7
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,570
<i>followed Treize Khushenrada's</i>
<i>retaliation,</i>

8
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,448
<i>including his being</i>
<i>stripped of all power.</i>

9
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:57,361
<i>At the same time, the Foundation</i>
<i>was rapidly</i>

10
00:01:57,530 --> 00:01:59,245
<i>expanding its area of</i>
<i>rule,</i>

11
00:01:59,245 --> 00:02:02,581
<i>thanks to the highly</i>
<i>skilled mobile dolls.</i>

12
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:04,730
<i>The year is After Colony 195.</i>

13
00:02:04,898 --> 00:02:08,461
<i>After the space colonies</i>
<i>accepted the Foundation,</i>

14
00:02:08,461 --> 00:02:11,483
<i>execution orders were released</i>
<i>for the</i>

15
00:02:11,651 --> 00:02:13,718
<i>now isolated Gundam</i>
<i>pilots.</i>

16
00:02:13,718 --> 00:02:17,503
<i>For them it looked like the future</i>
<i>would take a turn for the worse.</i>

17
00:02:20,391 --> 00:02:24,436
<i>I'm fighting through this</i>
<i>longer than anyone,</i>

18
00:02:24,436 --> 00:02:27,198
<i>longer than anyone on earth.</i>

19
00:02:27,366 --> 00:02:31,110
<i>Longer than Relena, of the Sanc</i>
<i>Kingdom</i>

20
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:34,829
The Glass Kingdom

21
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:54,633
Let's go in, Miss Relena is in the
directors room of the institution.

22
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:56,760
We'll find our way in
alone from here.

23
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:59,443
You know I don't like lying at
all,

24
00:02:59,611 --> 00:03:03,141
but it certainly doesn't suit you
either Pagan.

25
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:04,476
Well I'm not gonna stay,

26
00:03:04,476 --> 00:03:08,105
so once I get my Gundam I'm
getting out of here on the double.

27
00:03:08,105 --> 00:03:11,483
Don't go Heero! The nation
desperately needs the Gundam.

28
00:03:11,483 --> 00:03:15,195
And we've gotta make sure
that we keep that fact a secret.

29
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,781
Relena sure doesn't
need any Gundam.

30
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:20,825
It's necessary to protect the
princess!

31
00:03:20,993 --> 00:03:22,786
Please understand Heero.

32
00:03:22,786 --> 00:03:27,500
You're such a kind person.

33
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:31,878
Who are those people?
[GIRL:] ‐Some boys for a change.

34
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:35,341
[GIRL 2:] I wonder which
country they're from.

35
00:03:35,341 --> 00:03:41,293
[GIRL 3:] Isn't the one in front a
servant?

36
00:03:41,461 --> 00:03:46,726
[GIRL 4:] ‐Looks young for a
bodyguard.

37
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,748
On behalf of this institution,

38
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,481
I welcome you both to the Sanc
Kingdom.

39
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:55,235
Heero, have you still not
received your school uniform?

40
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:57,280
I don't plan to stay
here too long.

41
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,549
Once I'm done here, I'm leaving.
‐ Heero!

42
00:04:00,549 --> 00:04:06,190
Hmm. Trowa Barton,
a former Gundam pilot

43
00:04:06,358 --> 00:04:08,581
and on officer in Oz space
forces.

44
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:13,713
He was last confirmed at
0‐X point of L2‐LE area.

45
00:04:13,713 --> 00:04:18,676
Noin told me about him,
that he's a very important person.

46
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,720
Many friends in the Sanc
Kingdom could help us.

47
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,890
I have taken on the
search for him.

48
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,810
Heero, couldn't you at least
stay until the search is over?

49
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:29,901
Don't you think Gundam pilots
would

50
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,523
end up being a burden to the Sanc
Kingdom?

51
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:35,183
I don't plan to make a big
announcement about it,

52
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:38,278
but hiding the facts
won't solve anything either.

53
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,615
Besides, there's no battle
in this country.

54
00:04:40,615 --> 00:04:43,979
That's why you're here, you're
nothing more than male students.

55
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:01,321
<i>[DOROTHY:] Miss Relena, I applaud</i>
<i>your prompt decision</i>

56
00:05:01,490 --> 00:05:03,345
<i>for these fateful</i>
<i>arrangements.</i>

57
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:06,890
I would like you all to meet your
two new classmates.

58
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:09,310
Would you please
introduce yourselves?

59
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,261
Quatre Raberba Winner.

60
00:05:18,193 --> 00:05:21,030
[DOCTOR J:] Operation Meteor
is about to commence,

61
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:25,410
I'll contact you on the targets to
attack, and on the enemy data.

62
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,368
[HEERO:] Roger.

63
00:05:26,368 --> 00:05:28,913
[DOCTOR J:] Then quickly
proceed with the mission.

64
00:05:28,913 --> 00:05:29,788
Roger.

65
00:05:29,788 --> 00:05:32,416
[DOCTOR J:] We should decide
on a codename for you.

66
00:05:32,416 --> 00:05:36,476
Let's use the name of the peace
minded leader of outer space.

67
00:05:36,645 --> 00:05:37,296
Understood?

68
00:05:37,296 --> 00:05:38,471
Understood.

69
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:50,595
My name's Heero Yuy. Pleasure.

70
00:05:55,398 --> 00:05:57,358
[QUATRE:] They're all girls!

71
00:05:57,358 --> 00:05:58,985
I guess it's really true then.

72
00:05:58,985 --> 00:06:00,853
They say that men don't believe in

73
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:03,113
solving all matters through
discussion.

74
00:06:03,113 --> 00:06:05,491
You can't make such a
generalization.

75
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:08,493
Some women enjoy battles
just as much as men.

76
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:14,451
[DOROTHY:] Mind if I challenge you
to a fight?

77
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,335
[HEERO:] ‐Hmm?

78
00:06:16,335 --> 00:06:18,525
[DOROTHY:] You introduced
yourself to us

79
00:06:18,693 --> 00:06:21,048
but I haven't had the
chance to do the same.

80
00:06:21,048 --> 00:06:23,498
My name is Dorothy Catalonia.
I'm related

81
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:26,178
to the leader of the
Romefeller Foundation.

82
00:06:26,178 --> 00:06:29,598
[HEERO:] Hmph.

83
00:06:29,598 --> 00:06:33,068
Despite that, Miss Relena welcomed
me as a student.

84
00:06:33,236 --> 00:06:35,730
I hope we'll get to
know each other.

85
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:40,660
Which means I'll have to be
strong,

86
00:06:40,828 --> 00:06:45,615
cause I hear you hate weak women!

87
00:06:45,615 --> 00:06:51,578
Once upon a time there were two
people with the same name.

88
00:06:51,578 --> 00:06:55,081
One of them risked his life to
bring peace

89
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:58,168
to outer space and became
legendary.

90
00:06:58,168 --> 00:07:01,901
Many people were saddened by his
death and

91
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:05,801
they angrily swore to take revenge
for him.

92
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:09,400
And now, the other person with the
same name

93
00:07:09,568 --> 00:07:12,183
is also about to become
a legend!

94
00:07:12,183 --> 00:07:16,020
This warrior is known for his
superhuman abilities and power.

95
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:19,065
And he too will probably
fight for peace!

96
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:27,805
But I wonder if he'll end up
losing his life

97
00:07:27,973 --> 00:07:32,203
becoming a legend
too!

98
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:36,706
No good. A legendary knight
doesn't lose on purpose.

99
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:39,720
There's no way you should lose to
a woman

100
00:07:39,888 --> 00:07:41,795
just to hide your identity.

101
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:45,381
You must first live a strong,
noble, and intense life.

102
00:07:45,381 --> 00:07:47,050
You can save dying for later.

103
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:49,038
You should be able to make
yourself

104
00:07:49,206 --> 00:07:50,721
into a much bigger
legend.

105
00:07:50,721 --> 00:07:53,729
Isn't that true, Heero Yuy!?

106
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:14,233
Hmmm. Impressive. But I'm not
too bad myself am I, Heero?

107
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:18,958
I'm having a tough time
following what you're saying.

108
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,249
There must be two guys named
Heero Yuy besides myself.

109
00:08:24,963 --> 00:08:27,966
Hmmm. I knew you'd try to
hide your identity.

110
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:32,300
And now we'll be together in the
Sanc Kingdom.

111
00:08:32,468 --> 00:08:34,640
Glad to meet you, Heero.

112
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,891
Did you call for me Relena?

113
00:08:36,891 --> 00:08:39,270
I just received an
application from Romefeller

114
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:42,021
for approval to start a battle
in the Sanc Kingdom.

115
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,191
What's this all about Noin?

116
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:47,861
A Treize Faction unit running from
Oz is in the southern forests.

117
00:08:47,861 --> 00:08:50,171
I contacted them earlier today
ordering them

118
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,531
to move out
immediately.

119
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:54,493
Can they escape if they were
forced to leave?

120
00:08:54,493 --> 00:08:56,071
A number of them are injured.

121
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,705
But they also have the option of
surrendering.

122
00:08:58,705 --> 00:09:01,333
It's not something that
concerns this nation.

123
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:02,876
Some are injured?

124
00:09:02,876 --> 00:09:05,336
Romefeller's assault troops
are hunting them down.

125
00:09:05,336 --> 00:09:07,183
I'll contact the Treize Faction
again

126
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:09,300
and have them leave
the country at once.

127
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:11,980
No wait! Pagan,
couldn't we somehow

128
00:09:12,148 --> 00:09:14,596
treat them as temporary refugees?

129
00:09:14,596 --> 00:09:16,348
Then we'd also avoid any attacks

130
00:09:16,348 --> 00:09:18,683
from Romefeller.
‐NOIN: Relena!

131
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,770
I am well aware of the fact that
the Romefeller Foundation

132
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,771
holds the Sanc
Kingdom in contempt.

133
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:26,775
But we still can't simply
ignore the injured.

134
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,445
I won't sacrifice my humanity
just to avoid chaos.

135
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:33,365
Please Noin, understand.

136
00:09:33,365 --> 00:09:37,212
I follow you. I'll tell the
Treize Faction members.

137
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:47,963
Damn! Why'd we have to end
up escaping into the Sanc Kingdom?

138
00:09:47,963 --> 00:09:52,885
The attacks by the new Oz were
staged to lead us into this area.

139
00:09:52,885 --> 00:09:54,636
We've been used like puppets.

140
00:09:54,636 --> 00:09:56,740
We gave the Romefeller Foundation

141
00:09:56,908 --> 00:09:59,141
an excuse to enter
the Sanc Kingdom.

142
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,476
There's no time to sit
around like this!

143
00:10:01,476 --> 00:10:05,021
We've caused enough trouble
for this country. Let's go.

144
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:07,820
Captain! You can't expect yourself
to cross the border

145
00:10:07,988 --> 00:10:09,110
in the state
you're in!

146
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,693
Nonsense!

147
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,098
We must leave here as soon as
possible

148
00:10:12,266 --> 00:10:14,990
so we don't smear the Treize
Faction's name.

149
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:15,531
Captain!

150
00:10:15,531 --> 00:10:17,808
The Sanc Kingdom is on the line.

151
00:10:17,976 --> 00:10:21,038
They have instructions
from Princess Relena.

152
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,750
<i>This is Lucrezia Noin of the</i>
<i>Sanc Kingdom imperial guards.</i>

153
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:26,391
<i>Our nation is prepared to</i>

154
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:29,130
<i>temporarily</i>
<i>accept you into the country.</i>

155
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,598
<i>[NOIN:] Princess Relena's</i>
<i>instructions are for you</i>

156
00:10:31,766 --> 00:10:33,883
<i>to discard your weapons and become</i>
<i>refugees.</i>

157
00:10:33,883 --> 00:10:35,803
<i>[NOIN:] We believe this is</i>
<i>the best solution</i>

158
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:37,888
We've got a lot of
injured men here.

159
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:41,850
Under normal circumstances we'd
be glad to accept your kind offer.

160
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:43,643
But we've been led into a trap!

161
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:47,313
I can't see Oz leaving us alone.
<i>[NOIN:] ‐A trap?</i>

162
00:10:47,313 --> 00:10:50,275
As soon as we retreated here,
they stopped attacking.

163
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:53,298
They should have no problems
eliminating our troops,

164
00:10:53,466 --> 00:10:54,613
considering our state

165
00:10:54,613 --> 00:10:56,698
yet they're getting
reinforcements.

166
00:10:56,698 --> 00:11:00,201
At this rate the Sanc kingdom
could get involved in this battle.

167
00:11:00,201 --> 00:11:03,830
The only way to avoid that
is for us to leave this country.

168
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:04,956
Captain!

169
00:11:04,956 --> 00:11:07,450
<i>[NOIN:] The daughters of many</i>
<i>pacifist nations</i>

170
00:11:07,618 --> 00:11:08,960
<i>are currently living here.</i>

171
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:13,696
<i>Romefeller wants to start a battle</i>
<i>and stir up peace oriented nations</i>

172
00:11:13,865 --> 00:11:16,843
<i>which would lead to their</i>
<i>anxiety and disunity.</i>

173
00:11:16,843 --> 00:11:19,746
I understand. But by staying we'd
be giving

174
00:11:19,915 --> 00:11:22,140
the Sanc Kingdom an Achilles heel.

175
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:26,311
However, we're grateful for
the support of the princess.

176
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:28,605
[NOIN:] But... what do
you plan on doing?

177
00:11:28,605 --> 00:11:31,650
<i>[CAPTAIN:] Any further contact</i>
<i>would be an added burden on you.</i>

178
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:33,651
<i>I'd like to terminate</i>
<i>communication.</i>

179
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,696
<i>[CAPTAIN:] Just leave</i>
<i>the rest to us.</i>

180
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,990
Very well. I wish you the best

181
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,218
<i>[CAPTAIN:] Over and out.</i>

182
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,940
Their lives have to be sacrificed.
Forgive us, for the country‐

183
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:52,165
No!
The future.

184
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,637
Found it. Hmm?

185
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,643
There's Noin's mobile suit.
That's handy.

186
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,775
[SOLDIER:] The Sanc Kingdom is
contacting us again,

187
00:12:38,943 --> 00:12:39,635
what shall I do?

188
00:12:39,635 --> 00:12:42,053
Just bring them online!
‐Sir!

189
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:43,680
<i>This is Relena Peacecraft!</i>

190
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,930
<i>We have decided to accept the</i>
<i>Treize Faction members</i>

191
00:12:47,098 --> 00:12:47,768
<i>as refugees.</i>

192
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:50,228
<i>Any further infringements</i>
<i>on their rights will result in</i>

193
00:12:50,228 --> 00:12:51,646
<i>actions against the Foundation.</i>

194
00:12:51,646 --> 00:12:53,910
I believe you're slightly
misinformed!

195
00:12:54,078 --> 00:12:58,178
The Treize Faction is intending
to take over the central part of

196
00:12:58,346 --> 00:13:01,031
the Sanc Kingdom and remain
besieged there.

197
00:13:01,031 --> 00:13:03,450
[COMMANDER:] We believe we'd be
cooperating as peacekeepers

198
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:05,743
by attacking them before
they enter the city.

199
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:08,190
<i>The Treize Faction has no plans</i>
<i>to attack!</i>

200
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,040
<i>They've told me so</i>
<i>themselves!</i>

201
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,488
Those are their words?

202
00:13:11,656 --> 00:13:14,503
Well clearly we can't
trust that to be true.

203
00:13:14,503 --> 00:13:15,838
I'm ending transmission,

204
00:13:15,838 --> 00:13:18,840
since the enemy could be
listening to this conversation.

205
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,718
<i>Wait a minute! Take a</i>
<i>moment to reconfirm!</i>

206
00:13:21,718 --> 00:13:23,011
What shall we do sir?

207
00:13:23,011 --> 00:13:24,385
Chase them into the city!

208
00:13:24,553 --> 00:13:26,431
The greater the damage to the
city,

209
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:29,132
the greater the message on
pacifism's shortcomings!

210
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:46,660
They just do as they wish! Pagan!
Take me to them. And let's hurry.

211
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,288
That's dangerous! You must
stay here, I implore you.

212
00:13:50,288 --> 00:13:54,000
I'm gonna go and stop them!
It's the only choice I have!

213
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,920
Once the battle starts,
this area will be in chaos.

214
00:13:56,920 --> 00:14:00,423
A perfect place for the new Oz
to cover up their crimes.

215
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:02,305
There's no telling what they're
planning

216
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:03,635
to achieve in this
battle.

217
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:06,180
So you're saying they
may target me.

218
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,851
But no matter what happens,
right now I must stop them!

219
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:16,315
[PAGAN:] Miss Relena!

220
00:14:16,315 --> 00:14:17,481
Dorothy!

221
00:14:17,481 --> 00:14:20,568
[DOROTHY:] Miss Relena! Come on,
hurry!

222
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:25,781
Let's get going, or else
we're gonna miss the fight!

223
00:14:25,781 --> 00:14:27,200
Oh!

224
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,773
[NOIN:] Yes, armed suits that
shouldn't be found

225
00:14:29,941 --> 00:14:30,996
in a pacifist
nation.

226
00:14:30,996 --> 00:14:34,375
[NOIN:] They're space mobile suits
redesigned for battle on land.

227
00:14:34,375 --> 00:14:36,710
Does the princess know
about these units?

228
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,958
[NOIN:] No. People think about
fighting

229
00:14:39,126 --> 00:14:41,548
because they possess weapons such
as these.

230
00:14:41,548 --> 00:14:46,011
In order to cling to peace which
is really as fragile as glass.

231
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:48,221
Those would be her words.

232
00:14:48,221 --> 00:14:51,016
But right now we have no
choice but to fight!

233
00:14:51,016 --> 00:14:52,475
Heero's already headed out.

234
00:14:52,475 --> 00:14:56,563
I'm sure his actions'll be in the
best interest of the Sanc Kingdom.

235
00:14:56,563 --> 00:14:58,856
[QUATRE:] Let's head out after
him with these Tauruses!

236
00:14:58,856 --> 00:15:00,293
[NOIN:] Right! I'll prepare them.

237
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:14,115
[SOLDIER:] The setup is complete

238
00:15:14,283 --> 00:15:16,583
CAPTAIN: Good job! If we're unable
to escape

239
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:19,420
from this country,
then we'll have to disappear.

240
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:21,310
[SOLDIER:] The mobile dolls that
landed

241
00:15:21,478 --> 00:15:24,256
are taking further steps to
push us into the Sanc Kingdom.

242
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:26,111
[CAPTAIN:] Then get a move on!

243
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,511
Blow up every last trace of our
unit!

244
00:15:28,511 --> 00:15:29,680
[SOLDIER:] Who are you??
Huh?

245
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:34,810
[SOLDIER:] A kid??
‐It's a kid?

246
00:15:34,810 --> 00:15:36,968
Self‐detonation. Not a bad idea.

247
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:40,315
But if you're intending to die for
this country,

248
00:15:40,315 --> 00:15:43,610
there's a better way to make
use of your lives.

249
00:15:43,610 --> 00:15:45,861
Just what are you
talking about kid?

250
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:49,031
Would you consider protecting
this defenseless country?

251
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:52,576
Our unit doesn't have
much military power left.

252
00:15:52,576 --> 00:15:55,683
Those who want to ruin
Romefeller's plans,

253
00:15:55,851 --> 00:15:58,291
follow me, you might even survive.

254
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,376
[SOLDIER:] Who do you
think you are?

255
00:16:00,376 --> 00:16:04,340
Hmm? I'm returning a favor.
It's simple.

256
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,425
Okay, two or three of you,
come with me.

257
00:16:07,425 --> 00:16:09,678
Captain, do you really trust him?

258
00:16:09,678 --> 00:16:11,746
Not many people have the
confidence

259
00:16:11,915 --> 00:16:13,265
to defeat a mobile
doll.

260
00:16:13,265 --> 00:16:16,560
He's the one that
Romefeller fears so much.

261
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:20,230
You mean that kid is a
Gundam pilot?!

262
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:21,138
Pretty sure.

263
00:16:35,495 --> 00:16:46,965
[EXPLOSION]

264
00:16:46,965 --> 00:16:49,050
[EXPLOSION]

265
00:16:49,050 --> 00:16:50,760
They're hardly putting up a fight!

266
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:53,555
Okay, after we've wiped out
some of them in the forests,

267
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:55,641
we'll presume they're headed to
the city.

268
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:57,225
We'll pursue the main troops!

269
00:16:57,225 --> 00:17:01,058
Unidentified crafts are speeding
straight for us sir!

270
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:02,521
‐What did you say??

271
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,625
We'll face them in the air!
Right now we've got the advantage!

272
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:42,375
Miss Relena, have you ever had the
opportunity

273
00:17:42,543 --> 00:17:44,481
to see a real battle
in person?

274
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,150
It's something I've gone out
of my way to avoid.

275
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:50,945
That's natural, since people
do end up dying.

276
00:17:50,945 --> 00:17:52,698
Nobody actually wants to die.

277
00:17:52,866 --> 00:17:55,908
That's why those who are
fighting are so ndesperate.

278
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:59,885
[DOROTHY:] I think that's what
I find attractive about battles.

279
00:17:59,885 --> 00:18:01,381
Oh I get so excited!

280
00:18:01,381 --> 00:18:04,572
I'm certainly thankful that I'm
living in this era.

281
00:18:12,216 --> 00:18:16,011
Whats with that white mobile suit?
Which country owns it!?

282
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:18,056
Commander! There's a
mobile suit carrier!

283
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,100
Headed straight for us!
‐What?!

284
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:26,021
COMMANDER: Give orders to
the mobile dolls!

285
00:18:26,021 --> 00:18:28,108
[EXPLOSION]

286
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:29,988
[COMMANDER:] Good, we've shot it
down!

287
00:18:29,988 --> 00:18:31,313
Tricks like that won't work on us!

288
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:45,875
[EXPLOSION]

289
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:48,111
Can't be!
‐A GUNDAM!!

290
00:18:55,843 --> 00:18:57,553
Look! Stop the car!

291
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:18,116
[SCREECHING TIRES]

292
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:24,413
[EXPLOSION]

293
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,520
Dorothy! Are you okay Dorothy?
Huh?

294
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:56,321
[EXPLOSION]

295
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:58,515
[NOIN:] You'd probably say these
things are

296
00:19:58,683 --> 00:20:00,616
unnecessary in the Sanc Kingdom
Relena.

297
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:03,081
[NOIN:] But Romefeller's actions
are getting

298
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,205
more and more aggressive by the
day.

299
00:20:05,205 --> 00:20:09,000
I'm fully aware that this is
contrary to your beliefs.

300
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:12,086
But I've come to the conclusion
that we'll surely be destroyed

301
00:20:12,086 --> 00:20:14,213
without our own defensive force.

302
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:16,685
[NOIN:] I take full
responsibility,

303
00:20:16,853 --> 00:20:19,678
and am prepared to accept any
punishment.

304
00:20:19,678 --> 00:20:21,596
You shouldn't feel remorseful.

305
00:20:21,596 --> 00:20:24,785
This level of military power isn't
enough to

306
00:20:24,953 --> 00:20:27,851
directly fight the Romefeller
Foundation.

307
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,580
We can't sit here and let them
destroy us

308
00:20:30,748 --> 00:20:32,941
as the nation's former leader
did.

309
00:20:32,941 --> 00:20:38,571
Heero. Is my idea just a dream?
Or could it even be a mistake?

310
00:20:38,571 --> 00:20:41,130
Romefeller makes a point of
eliminating

311
00:20:41,298 --> 00:20:43,326
anything they find inconvenient.

312
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:45,620
Like the colonies. Or the Gundams.

313
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:50,291
And now Relena, you have
become their target.

314
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:53,170
I'm a soldier, I'll crush
them in battle.

315
00:20:53,170 --> 00:20:57,673
But the Foundation's current
targets refuse to fight back.

316
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,968
These times are changing fast.
All aspects of this battle

317
00:21:00,968 --> 00:21:03,138
are attributed to
their impatience.

318
00:21:03,138 --> 00:21:05,038
You propose total pacifism.

319
00:21:05,206 --> 00:21:08,310
The whole world is heading in that
direction.

320
00:21:08,310 --> 00:21:10,936
You have to understand what
Noin is saying.

321
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:15,525
Right now, defense is needed
to make time for discussion later.

322
00:21:15,525 --> 00:21:17,860
Where are you going? Hold on!

323
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:19,378
I'll go where my mind takes me.

324
00:21:19,546 --> 00:21:22,115
I've paid you back for your help
searching for Trowa.

325
00:21:22,115 --> 00:21:25,118
For me, there's no
place for pacifism.

326
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:27,661
The Gundams exist for
battles and nothing else.

327
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:31,123
If you were me, how would you
lead the Sanc Kingdom?

328
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:34,543
The same way as Noin.
Build a defense unit.

329
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,286
That would be the best way

330
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:39,215
to confront
the Romefeller Foundation now.

331
00:21:39,215 --> 00:21:42,843
Heero, and Noin, I approve.

332
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:45,888
I give you permission to do
as you see fit.

333
00:21:45,888 --> 00:21:46,708
[NOIN:] Relena‐

334
00:21:46,876 --> 00:21:49,391
‐How can I expect to come up with
the position

335
00:21:49,391 --> 00:21:52,151
that the world can agree to if I
can't even

336
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,563
agree with the people closest
to me?

337
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,874
Someday I'm gonna find out what it is

338
00:21:57,874 --> 00:21:59,779
that gives everyone the urge to fight!

339
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:11,956
[DOROTHY:] Mmmm. Impressive Miss
Relena.

340
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:15,960
You're not giving the Gundam
pilot the upper hand.

341
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,491
That's what I find so charming.

342
00:22:26,596 --> 00:23:38,876
