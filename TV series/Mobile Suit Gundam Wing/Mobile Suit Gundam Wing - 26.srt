The United Earth Sphere Alliance

17
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:24,040
had posted their own space
forces to the colonies

18
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:27,420
and strictly controlled the
freedom of the colony citizens.

19
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:29,500
After the collapse
of the Alliance,

20
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,150
the Space Forces had
remained in outer space

21
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:34,080
to further control the colonies.

22
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,290
However, the forces
were overpowered

23
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:39,820
by the mobility of OZ's space
mobile suits, the Tauruses,

24
00:02:39,820 --> 00:02:42,070
which had been sent
up from Siberia,

25
00:02:42,070 --> 00:02:46,080
and their powers of their space
forces were quickly diminishing.

deserve to live freely.

44
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,045
However, to date,

45
00:04:06,213 --> 00:04:09,440
the United Earth Sphere Alliance
has oppressed you.

The days of the Alliance
are now over.

A new order is being
built on Earth.

same here in space.

And OZ supports you all.

51

And that concludes the message
we've received from OZ Military.

52

Or rather the OZ peace
support organization.

I would like to discuss this
at our next scheduled meeting.

hurry to get our response.

my own right now.

My, you're very young
for a leader.

62
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:09,980
Couldn't you interpret
youth as potential?

63
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:11,360
Unlike our ancestors,

64
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,445
we third generation
colonists know OZ

65
00:05:13,613 --> 00:05:16,520
is different from
the Alliance military.

66
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:19,860
But OZ was part of the
Alliance at one point.

67
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,150
It’s naturally going
to take some time

00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:24,040
before the people
can understand.

former Alliance military

00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:29,220

there throughout the colonies.

liberate the next colony.

but I didn't catch your name.

Oh yes, that's right.

75
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,260
I am responsible for OZ's
outer space supervision.

76
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:49,000
And you can call me Lady Une.

77
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,870
One after another,

78
00:05:57,870 --> 00:05:59,785
forces of the former
Alliance Military

79
00:05:59,953 --> 00:06:01,710
unjustly stationed
in the colonies

80
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:03,300
have been forced to surrender.

81
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,900
With the new and
powerful OZ organization,

82
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,200
operations have commenced
for removal of space mines.

83
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,370
This should result in
the reestablishment

84
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:13,400
of communication
between the colonies.

85
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:17,190
I thought that OZ wanted
to take over the colonies

86
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,460
no matter what it took
for them to do it.

87
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:20,260
[QUATRE:] They do.

88
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,360
And they're using the
dirtiest method of all.

89
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:23,275
If OZ used force,

90
00:06:23,443 --> 00:06:26,180
then the colonies
would get ready to retaliate.

91
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,680
But they'd be accepted if they
used the guise of assistance.

92
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,800
Most people in outer
space take things easy.

93
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,200
I doubt if anyone will
question OZ's plans.

94
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,480
I think it's time for us
to return to space.

95
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,480
With our Gundams.

96
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,375
[QUATRE:] The Gundams were
built

97
00:06:44,543 --> 00:06:45,980
for the people of the colonies.

98
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:50,120
We’re the only ones that can
save people from OZ's evil plot.

99
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,120
[DUO:] You're right.

100
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,460
But how do we get into space?

101
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,320
It's important that we
don't get noticed.

102
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,900
[QUATRE:] We’ll do just
the opposite and get noticed!

103
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,550
If OZ is falsely promoting peace

104
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,420
while setting their sights
on taking over the colonies,

105
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:09,240
they can no longer threaten
the colonies to get to us.

106
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,820
[DUO:] But what if OZ
gives up their facade?

107
00:07:11,820 --> 00:07:12,900
[QUATRE:] That would mean

108
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,500
revealing their true identity
to the people of the colonies.

109
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,720
The present OZ wouldn't see
that as a wise thing to do.

110
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,560
Which means we can
still fight them!

111
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:27,120
Let's return to space!

112
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:34,460
I'm extremely impressed with OZ.

113
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:37,840
All Alliance Military troops in
this area have surrendered.

114
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,040
Are they trying to atone
for Heero Yuy's assassination?

115
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:42,860
That remark's unfair.

116
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,541
There’s no ground to the rumors

117
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:47,000
that OZ was even
behind that assassination.

118
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:50,620
That's what OZ would
have us think!

I came because I heard

122
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,140
you were about ready
to accept OZ's agreement!

123
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,840
These days OZ is
hoping for peace.

124
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,603
They're not an organization
to be trusted,

125

not in the past nor now.

126
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,690
Well, at the very least,

127
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:08,020
we do know Colonel Une
is trustworthy.

128
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,770
I hear she's executed a number

129
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:12,300
of aggressive and bloody
plans in the past.

130
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,840
Those are rumors!

131
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,980

the situation

132
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,380
and taking on the dangerous task
of removing space mines!

133
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,160
You don’t think it’s
because they

134
00:08:21,328 --> 00:08:22,780
hope to conquer outer space?

135
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,780
It’s a fact that they’re
currently working for

136
00:08:24,948 --> 00:08:26,240
the well‐being of the colonies.

137
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,900
In any case, sir,
OZ is reaching out to us

138
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:31,180
and it’s all in the
name of peace.

139
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,800
It's not in our best
interest to reject them.

our friendship with Earth.

00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,640
Destroying evidence?

162
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:49,360
Unfortunately he’d already
destroyed all the data.

163
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,160
Were you the one who
built the Gundams?

164
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,640
What a stupid way
to ask a question.

165
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,600
Just answer my question!

166
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,500
I think you’ve got a lot to
do with those five Gundams!

167
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,100
Nope.

168
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:02,860
Not with the other four.

169
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,860
What do you mean?

170
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,980
I designed the best
Gundam I possibly could.

171
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:09,875
Why in the world would I go and

172
00:10:10,043 --> 00:10:12,000
make four other
variations of it?

173
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,840
Are you saying you only
made one of those Gundams?

174
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:15,580
Yes.

175
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:18,140
A masterpiece I called the
Gundam Deathscythe.

176
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,200
The others are a fluke.

177
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,870
The Alliance prohibited
travel and communication

178
00:10:22,870 --> 00:10:24,440
between the colonies, right?

179
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,480
I made only one and only one.

180
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,760
You only made one?

181
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:30,490
It’s a coincidence
that the others

182
00:10:30,658 --> 00:10:31,820
were made at the same time?

183
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:34,980
Excuse me, I have a transmission
from Earth, Colonel Une!

184
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:36,620
They say Gundams 02 and 04

185
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:40,040
are presently attacking the
Singapore Space Port Base!

186
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
[LADY UNE:] What?

187
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,840
Well, so they’re coming
home as expected.

188
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:00,880
This newest OZ base isn't
anything like their others!

189
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,040
I can't get any
closer at this rate!

190
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:06,980
Let's go for the HLV equip
for mobile suit delivery!

191
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:18,860
Quatre!

192
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:28,940
Don't overdo it, Quatre!

193
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,040
[QUATRE:] It's okay.

194
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:30,820
We have to fight

195
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:33,240
so the other Gundam
pilots will figure it out!

196
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:34,700
Huh?

197
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:36,670
They'll see us
battling like this

198
00:11:36,670 --> 00:11:39,640
and realize that they need
to go to outer space as well.

199
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:42,000
That outer space
is waiting for us!

200
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,300
[EXPLOSIONS]

201
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:57,060
To outer space! Every one of us!

202
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:21,800
So those are the Gundams, huh?

203
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,480
They are attacking
OZ's base on Earth.

204
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,680
It’s true Alliance Military
oppressed the colonies

205
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,960
and OZ was once
part of the Alliance.

206
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:32,150
I can understand a
certain colony's feelings

207
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:34,100
wanting to retaliate
against the Earth.

208
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:36,000
Yes, but even as we speak,

209
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,603
our peaceful ways are finally

210
00:12:37,771 --> 00:12:40,220
changing opinions
within the OZ organization.

211
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,260
We can't continue to run
around with weapons.

212
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,640
Those Gundams are fighting

213
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:45,901
because they truly believe

214
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,180
they’re protecting the
colonies by doing so.

215
00:12:48,180 --> 00:12:48,940
So?

216
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,580
They're a nuisance
to the colonies.

217
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:52,900
We must make our
intentions clear to OZ

218
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,060
before the Gundams
make them uneasy.

219
00:12:55,060 --> 00:12:57,060
The Gundams love the colonies.

220
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,680
The Gundams have chosen to fight

221
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:01,380
because they love the colonies
more than anyone else.

222
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,380
[HONORARY ADVISOR:] Those
Gundams, they’re desperate.

223
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:09,700
They're facing their
enemies with limited power.

224
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,200
So why can't we
support these Gundams?

225
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,420
Let's see.

226
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:35,780
Good.

227
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,840
We made it into the
news all over the world!

228
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,140
Hmm? What's this?

229
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,700
[SPEAKER:] We wish to
publicly announce

230
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,720
a decision made by
Space Colony Area D.

231
00:13:46,220 --> 00:13:48,160
Mobile suits known as Gundams

232
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:51,800
are currently going around
destroying OZ's facilities.

233
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:57,260
These Gundams have nothing
to do with Colony Area D.

234
00:13:57,260 --> 00:14:00,770
We hereby declare that if the
Gundams consider OZ an enemy

235
00:14:00,770 --> 00:14:03,140
then we will consider
the Gundams ours!

236
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:05,520
OZ has been fair to us.

237
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,990
Didn’t take long for OZ and us

238
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:10,840
to work out our misunder‐
standings toward each other.

239
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:13,900
We hope that the Gundams
are defeated in this battle.

240
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,760
We further hope that
the other colonies

241
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,540
will follow the example we’ve
set with this declaration.

242
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,400
I expected this.

243
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,120
But even so, it's still
hard to swallow!

244
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,560
[QUATRE:] It's all right, Duo.

245
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,160
We came down to Earth all alone.

246
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,320
It's okay if the colonies
don't understand right away.

247
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,530
I'm just happy knowing
there are others

248
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:37,080
fighting with the same
kind of feelings that I have.

249
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,080
That's more than enough.

250
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,320
Argh!

251
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,860
[DUO:] Quatre!

252
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,360
Come on, Sandrock, stand up!

253
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:04,760
It's way too early
to be defeated yet!

254
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,480
[DUO:] Damn it!

255
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:11,760
At this rate, we're not
gonna make it.

256
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,900
But I still think what we're
doing is probably a good thing.

257
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:19,820
So why is it we have
to die in a place like this?!

258
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,120
[WUFEI:] That’s because
we are doing the right thing!

259
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,280
We are right. We are!

260
00:15:44,340 --> 00:15:45,660
It's that guy!

261
00:15:45,660 --> 00:15:48,180
The ones who are right
have to be strong!

262
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:51,620
If this is all you guys can do,
then so be it.

263
00:15:51,620 --> 00:15:53,780
The rest of us will take
over from here.

264
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:00,380
[DUO:] The rest of you
will take over?

265
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,120
That's more like it!

266
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:05,965
You'd have a hard time
explaining it to your comrades

267
00:16:06,133 --> 00:16:07,460
if you were defeated here.

268
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,640
[DUO:] They figured out
we need help!

269
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:18,060
[QUATRE:] They got it! They
all understood our message.

270
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:32,460
My mission is to wipe OZ out.

271
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:35,300
If they're headed for
outer space, then I'll follow.

272
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,840
[TROWA:] It's gonna be
a difficult battle.

273
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:49,380
But right now I’m sensing
peace in our 5 hearts.

274
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,705
[OZ SOLDIER:] Is that the colony

275
00:16:58,873 --> 00:17:00,400
where the fifth engineer
is holding out?

276
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,920
[LADY UNE:] The other four
hardly put up a fight.

277
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,270
But it appears there's

278
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:07,600
a stubborn one
who’ll try to resist.

279
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:12,720
[OZ SOLDIER #2:] Colonel.

280
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:14,090
There's a factory in a block

281
00:17:14,090 --> 00:17:16,980
outside the colony but access
has been completely shut off.

282
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,880
[LADY UNE:] You've advised
him to surrender, have you?

283
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:22,700
He has ignored
all communication.

284
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:24,700
Then there's only one answer.

285
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:26,220
Open fire on him!

286
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:27,005
[OZ SOLDIER:] Colonel!

287
00:17:27,173 --> 00:17:28,600
We’ve got heat detected
from the colony!

288
00:17:30,980 --> 00:17:33,520
Front‐line troops,
spread out now!

289
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:40,040
[SCREAMING, EXPLOSIONS]

290
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,080
Two manned suits
have been defeated!

291
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,240
[OZ SOLDIER:] The mobile dolls

292
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,260
are unharmed because
of their quicker reaction time!

293
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:46,060
[LADY UNE:] Taurus
mobile doll unit,

294
00:17:46,060 --> 00:17:47,960
prepare to fire
special beam cannons!

295
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:50,100
[OZ SOLDIER:] Colonel, the
beam cannons are too strong!

296
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:52,960
They'd cause a lot of damage
if they hit the colony directly!

297
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,726
Nichol, since when has OZ

298
00:17:54,895 --> 00:17:57,160
tiptoed its way
through a battle?

299
00:17:57,620 --> 00:18:00,340
We're not trying to
establish diplomatic relations.

300
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,820
We are trying to win a war here!

301
00:18:03,260 --> 00:18:06,120
[LADY UNE:] Damage to the
colony wouldn't be our fault.

302
00:18:06,120 --> 00:18:09,400
It'd be the fault of the rebel
holding out against us.

303
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:13,200
[DR. J:] Haha, I’m delighted
to hear that OZ

304
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,820
is as mean spirited
as it always was.

305
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,480
In that case, I'll happily
surrender to you.

306
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,980
[LADY UNE:] Good,
I accept your surrender.

307
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:22,860
Come out at once!

308
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:27,020
I'm certain that one
day the colonies

309
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:29,860
will come to recognize
the dark side of OZ.

310
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:33,200
[DR. J:] But I won't let the
Gundams' battle go to waste!

311
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,900
Hurry up, Quatre!

312
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:50,570
[OZ SOLDIER:]
A Gundam's operating

00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:52,640
the mobile suit delivery
HLV spacecraft!

314
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:53,560
Surround it!

315
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:57,260
Those suits will try to shoot us
down when we start to lift off.

316
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:01,440
Quatre, hurry up!

317
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,900
Don't worry about me.

318
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,460
I'll back you two up
until you lift off!

319
00:19:05,460 --> 00:19:07,460
Have you lost your
mind or something?

320
00:19:07,460 --> 00:19:09,840
We all have to
make it up to space!

321
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,300
[QUATRE:] I know, but that's
why I have to back you up.

322
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,900
To make sure that at least
you two make it into space!

323
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,320
[DUO:] Quatre!

324
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:18,480
[QUATRE:] Please!

325
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,100
I can't take this much longer!

326
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,100
[WUFEI:] I'm grateful.

327
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:25,903
The only way to
show my appreciation

328
00:19:26,071 --> 00:19:27,620
is to make it into space safely.

329
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,120
You fool!

330
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:36,140
And now...

331
00:19:36,740 --> 00:19:40,180
the last choice open to
me is to self‐detonate.

332
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,140
[QUATRE:] What's this?

333
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:57,700
Are... are you telling
me to get off?

334
00:19:57,700 --> 00:19:59,700
Thank you Sandrock!

335
00:20:13,820 --> 00:20:17,080
I thank you, my dear Sandrock.

336
00:21:08,420 --> 00:21:09,400
[OZ SOLDIER:] Get in there!

337
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,920
Hi!

338
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,920
What took you?

339
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:18,500
Why didn't you guys
put up more of a fight?

340
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:21,740
There were just too
many other things to do.

341
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,740
But anyway.

342
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,120
It's been fifteen years.

343
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,960
I'm amazed that all five
of us were successful

344
00:21:32,128 --> 00:21:33,760
in completing our Gundams.

345
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,680
[OZ SOLDIER:] Shall we
have a public trial on this?

346
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:44,060
[LADY UNE:] No, there are
other ways we can use them.

347
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:46,223
After all, they are
the engineers

348
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,960
that built those Gundams.

349
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,120
Excuse me Colonel!

350
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,060
Five shuttles with Gundam pilots

351
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:53,620
have lifted off and are
heading for space!

352
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:57,500
Prepare to fire low‐orbit
satellite missiles! Right now!

353
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:59,900
Problems located in the
electric power generator.

354
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,060
[OZ SOLDIER:]
The system’s jammed!

355
00:22:01,060 --> 00:22:03,060
Radio’s down,
and the radar's offline!

356
00:22:03,340 --> 00:22:06,520
What in the world could be
causing all of this to happen?

357
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:10,440
Hey OZ.

358
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:14,300
You're going to seriously regret
that you kept us alive.

359
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,020
Not to mention the pilots.

360
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:37,200
[ENDING MUSIC]

361
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,470
[NARRATOR:] The battle between
the Tallgeese and Gundam

362
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:45,320
concluded one
chapter of the war.

363
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:48,260
However, a cruel destiny
still awaited the pilots.

364
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:50,028
In a mortally wounded state,

365
00:23:50,196 --> 00:23:52,220
Quatre calls
on the other pilots.

366
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,480
Zechs refuses to fight

367
00:23:53,648 --> 00:23:55,960
as a knight of the
Romefeller Foundation.

368
00:23:55,960 --> 00:23:59,380
But Treize then demands
that Zechs die a hero.

369
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:02,360
Next, on Gundam Wing Episode 18:

370
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,920
Tallgeese Destroyed
