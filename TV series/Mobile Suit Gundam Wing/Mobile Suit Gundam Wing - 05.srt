reflected their
retaliatory intentions.

4
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:34,620
The Gundams’ target is OZ,

5
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:39,900
who'd masked its identity in the
troops of the Alliance military.

6
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:43,960
The Gundams had a number
of missions to attack OZ.

OZ has finally taken
center stage.

The battle between the mobile
suits sent to Earth and OZ...

13
00:02:03,803 --> 00:02:06,420
causes the Earth to
shudder violently.

14
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:11,160
Yeah, and I think it’ll be
a big hit with the soldiers.

15
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,080
Wow. Trowa’s usually so quiet
so it must be a good idea.

There’s nothing wrong with
acting on your emotions.

I was taught.

Moscow, huh? Now, would
she be there with Col. Une?

00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,760
No, the Lieutenant’s

In any case, we’re

Mogadishu fortress.

It was approved by Lt. Noin.

105
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:59,320
Are you sure? Didn’t Col. Zechs
twist her arm or something?

106
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:03,920
I heard Noin’s trip to Moscow
had to do with Col. Zechs too.

107
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,960
That is true, but Lt. Noin
planned this trip on her own.

108
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:11,420
Think she’d do anything
for a killer of his own men?

Everyone here would do anything
they could for Col. Zechs.

You fool! We only follow the
orders of Treize Kushrenada.

111
00:08:19,100 --> 00:08:24,160
Lt. Noin taught us to make His

That’s enough. Meuller.

But, Alex...

115
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:32,780
We can still request
more of their soldiers, pal.

116
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,861
I just explained,

117
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:37,440
we don’t have any experienced
soldiers stationed here.

118
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,740
You do have one.

119
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:44,500
An elite soldier by the
name of Col. Zechs Marquise.

120
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,113
We can determine the combat
skills of the pilot...

121
00:08:56,281 --> 00:08:57,526
by matching this data...

122
00:08:57,526 --> 00:08:59,250
to the basic capacities
of the 01,

123
00:08:59,418 --> 00:09:01,140
as we can judge
from its remains.

124
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:03,140
What do the remains tell you?

125
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,638
It’s completely destroyed.

126
00:09:04,806 --> 00:09:08,240
01’s self‐detonation device
couldn’t have worked any better.

127
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,380
Could the Gundam pilot
have survived?

128
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:11,200
Doubt it.

129
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,600
This can’t be!

130
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,600
What is it?

131
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,951
It says this pilot wasn’t human.

132
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,840
I must’ve input
something incorrectly.

133
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,940
What do the results say exactly?

134
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:22,705
Response speed was unusual.

135
00:09:22,705 --> 00:09:26,760
Same with strength and endurance
to gravitational force.

136
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:28,715
I heard that the pilot
was still a boy.

137
00:09:28,883 --> 00:09:30,420
These figures are unthinkable!

138
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,843
Not surprising.

139
00:09:32,011 --> 00:09:33,803
I’m sure he must’ve gone through

140
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:36,160
special training courses
in outer space.

141
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:43,716
But these results have
completely undermined

142
00:09:43,885 --> 00:09:45,880
any psychological
advantages I had.

143
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:50,520
I thought our differences
lay only in of our mobile suits.

144
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:55,068
That pilot might even be
able to bring out

145
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:57,400
the full capacity of
this Tallgeese.

146
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,586
An impressive piece of work.

147
00:10:00,755 --> 00:10:05,100
I had no idea you had a taste
for antiques, Colonel.

148
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,620
You’re not really expecting to
use this in combat, are you?

149
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:11,620
In fact, I’ve already
used this suit.

150
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,620
I heard a nasty rumor that 01
self‐detonated in Siberia.

151
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:17,965
It was also used to
attack the Sanc Kingdom

152
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:19,800
in Northern Europe, wasn’t it?

153
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,580
I bet that guy who lost his
life piloting this thing...

154
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:25,411
would’ve preferred something
a little less antiquated,

155
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:26,980
don’t you think, Col. Zechs?

156
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,300
What are you getting at?

157
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,871
We’re planning to attack
the Mogadishu Fortress

00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:36,650
But our mobile suit troops alone
couldn’t possibly conquer it.

We wanted to get some help
from soldiers at this base.

As your subordinate.

tomorrow on the Tallgeese.

and selfish decision?

318
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,870
Did you give a thought to the
people you'd leave behind?

319
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:19,120
You're the most pathetic
person I ever met!

320
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,785
You didn't think about us!
The people you'd leave behind!

321
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,120
We'd have to keep on
living in sorrow.

322
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,755
You're the one that
brainwashed...

323
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:41,921
my Trowa with your
strange ideas.

324
00:21:41,921 --> 00:21:44,320
I won't let you off so
easy next time.

325
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,956
That girl’s tears stopped me.

326
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:50,060
If you were in my shoes you
still would've done it, right?

327
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:53,020
Now you should know why
I admire your strength.

328
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,786
I’ve said this before.

329
00:21:54,955 --> 00:21:59,020
The only way to live a good life
is to act on your emotions.

330
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,020
Let's get going.

331
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:02,440
Yeah.

332
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:07,158
I’m sorry to see him
that boy leave.

333
00:22:07,326 --> 00:22:08,565
He really was pretty good.

334
00:22:08,565 --> 00:22:11,820
With training, he could've
been the best in the business.

335
00:22:11,820 --> 00:22:13,010
What're you talking about?

336
00:22:13,178 --> 00:22:16,020
You gotta let go of your kids
if you want them to grow up.

337
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,731
We helped raised Trowa
in this circus,

338
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,323
so I’m sure he'll
come back one day.

339
00:22:21,323 --> 00:22:23,020
He'll come back for sure.

340
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:35,240
[ENDING MUSIC]

341
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,881
Heero tries to make up
for his mistake of killing

342
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:45,880
the honorable leader Noventa,
pacifist of the former Alliance.

343
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:48,181
Within the war zones
created by OZ,

344
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:51,780
Heero confronts Sylvia,
the granddaughter of Noventa.

345
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:54,900
How can he compensate
for his wrongdoing?

346
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:55,813
Just about then,

347
00:23:55,981 --> 00:23:59,180
Zechs is handed an order from
the Romefeller Foundation.

348
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:05,020
