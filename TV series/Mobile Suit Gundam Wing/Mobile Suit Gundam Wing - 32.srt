laid eyes on a Gundam

shall not live to

00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,520
Those are the
orders I was given.

00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:35,080
There’s a Gundam down here!

00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,080
Hey, are you all right?

7
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:50,980
I need a favor of you.

8
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:54,040
Reload the explosives
for Heero Yui.

9
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,540
Forget that.

Stop worrying about
that right now!

[NARRATOR:] The Sorrowful Battle

13

[OZ SOLDIER:] We're
currently above

14
00:02:12,098 --> 00:02:13,680
the Filchner Ice Shelf
of Weddell Sea.

15
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,540
We should be at the Barclay
Base in five minutes.

16
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:18,660
Any signs of enemies
in the area?

17
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,480
[OZ SOLDIER:] Nothing on either
the radar or heat sensors.

18
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,840
[NOIN:] I see.

19
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:25,630
I guess we’d better expect
Acht's search party

20
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:27,750
to regroup before
staging an assault

21
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,580
rather than assume they've
given up pursuing us.

22
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:32,580
That's a wise decision.

23
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,660
So OZ does have
one elite officer.

24
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,460
Hello Colonel Zechs.

25
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:03,100
I've brought Heero Yuy and Trowa
Barton to you, as requested.

26
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,400
Thank you.

27
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,900
You can call me Zechs Merquise.

28
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,900
Are we supposed
to shake hands now?

29
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:11,520
No. It's fine.

30
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:17,400
Heero Yuy, is it?

31
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,770
That’s the same
name as the leader

32
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:21,780
that kept the space
colonies together.

33
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,780
Is that what your real name is?

34
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:26,500
Is that your real name
you’re using?

35
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,540
Forgive me.

36
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:32,380
I guess there's no sense in us
using names from this point on.

37
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,010
We've done our best

38
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:36,660
to prepare a hospitable
reception for you.

00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,400

yourselves comfortable.

[MEISER:] Colonel Zechs!

43
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:56,540
The repairs to 01
have been completed.

44
00:03:56,540 --> 00:03:57,600
The only things left

45
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,300
are the operational adjustments.

46
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,280
I'll introduce you.

47
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:03,820
This is Meiser, who’s in charge
of restoring your Gundam.

48
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,760
How are ya?

49
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,520
All that's left is adjusting
the cockpit to suit yourself.

50
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,760
Meiser's young, but
his skills are top class.

51
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:11,980
When can we start?

52
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,620
How does tomorrow
morning sound?

00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,840
That's fine.

Heero Yuy!

55
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:19,310
Isn’t there something
you’re forgetting

56
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,400
to say to Colonel Zechs?

57
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,400
I will thank him,
but in my own way.

58
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:25,400
I'll kill Zechs.

59
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:27,980
That's how I'll
show my gratitude.

this battle is no more
than a temporary obstacle.

63
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,500
And I'm a mere stepping stone.

64
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:44,480
I've never shaken hands
with anyone before.

65
00:04:45,980 --> 00:04:49,720
[NOIN:] I have a feeling that I
must not let either of them die.

66
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:51,360
Of course not Zechs,

67
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
but not Heero either.

[OZ SOLDIER:] I’ve already told
you a number of times.

We've destroyed Gundam 01.

There isn't a single
stabilizer left here.

until after I meet

whether or not that's true.

The Colonel isn't here.

Then you should let me
meet with Lieutenant Noin,

I’m sure she’ll meet with me

if you tell her that
I'm Relena Peacecraft.

[OZ SOLDIER:] Yes.

[NOIN:] Even the Peacecrafts
have caught on.

89
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,380
I expect the Romefeller
Foundation’s found out by now.

90
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:46,020
[OZ SOLDIER:] Please be
very cautious, Lieutenant.

91
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,580
[NOIN:] Thank you, I will.

92
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:50,040
From now on,
there will likely be

93

all kinds of people
trying to fly

94
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,400
to the Romefeller Foundation.

95
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:57,480
Defeating Zechs, who's seen as
the defender of the Gundams,

96
00:05:57,480 --> 00:06:00,760
would be the perfect way to
show loyalty to the Foundation.

97
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:02,990
The search party's manhunt

98
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:04,460
could be intense.

99
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,010
But Zechs is
practically OZ's hero,

100
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:09,420
so why would they
even be after him?

101
00:06:09,420 --> 00:06:12,840
Is the path Zechs is
about to take not wrong?

102

[GASP]

103
00:06:13,460 --> 00:06:14,520
[ZECHS:] I’m sorry.

104
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,000
I wasn’t listening
in on purpose.

105
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:20,280
I might have at least a
partial answer to your question.

106
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,380
Over the many years
I spent with OZ,

107
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:26,940
I started to develop an
aesthetic sense in a war.

108
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,790
A sense that fighters could have

109
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,060
as the only nature they would
acknowledge in each other,

110
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,340
though separated as
enemies and allies.

111
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,980
But those Gundam
pilots are desperate.

112
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:40,200
They'll battle even if it
means forfieting their lives.

113
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,800
They live the true
lives of soldiers.

114
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,620
I am much too weak.

115
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,481
[NOIN:] That’s because they know

116
00:06:47,650 --> 00:06:49,280
they're fighting for
the colonies!

117
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,040
Zechs, you have
someone to protect too!

118
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,710
[ZECHS:] I don't have any right

119
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:55,380
being given someone to protect.

120
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,890
But they would probably say

121
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:59,080
that very thought itself
makes me weak.

122
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,080
There's no need to try
to make battles look good.

123
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,880
If that’s the only type of
battle I’m capable of,

124
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,580
I'll simply be defeated here
and now by the Gundam.

125
00:07:07,580 --> 00:07:09,580
What this is, is war.

126
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,040
Some lessons can only be
learned by risking one's life.

127
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:14,360
But, Zechs...

128
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,380
Noin.

129
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,380
This battle will take time.

130
00:07:17,380 --> 00:07:20,420
I hope we can fight
without interruptions.

131
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,400
[NOIN:] Leave it to me.

132
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,420
I'll do everything to
prevent the search party

133
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:24,480
from getting in the way.

134
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:26,560
Actually, I’m more concerned

135
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,440
about the dignitary
of the Peacecraft.

136
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,440
My dear Imperial Guard.

137
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,280
Zechs.

138
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,220
The most important
person to you is Relena.

139
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:37,640
You'll fight your best

140
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:40,100
knowing you have
to protect that girl.

141
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,280
[MEISER:] He doesn't
trust me, does he?

142
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,020
[TROWA:]
It's not that.

143
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:48,240
He just doesn't want anyone
touching his mobile suit.

144
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:48,800
That's all.

145
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,500
Yeah, but still.

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:54,820
The self‐detonation
device isn't connected.

147
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,440
[MEISER:] Colonel Zechs
says you won't be needing it.

148
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:00,540
Zechs had regrets
after their last showdown.

149
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:02,840
So this time he
wanted to make sure

150
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,360
the fight lasts longer.

151
00:08:07,760 --> 00:08:08,980
[TROWA:] Aren't
you gonna fight

152
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:09,940
in your own mobile suit?

153
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:12,740
[HEERO:] I think I’ll use
yours after all.

154
00:08:12,740 --> 00:08:13,560
[TROWA:] How come?

155
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,965
[HEERO:] All of this generosity

156
00:08:16,133 --> 00:08:18,000
is blurring the
focus on fighting.

157
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,300
[TROWA:] I can’t see that
being an issue with you.

158
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:23,580
No, I'm talking about him.

159
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:26,090
You're strong.

160
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,540
You really are.

So he'll fight with the 03
rather than the 01.

[MEISER:] But what in the world

164
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:36,920
could they be thinking
of, Colonel Zechs?

165
00:08:36,920 --> 00:08:39,720
He sees our gifts
as some kind of charity.

166
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:42,100
But my feelings have
remained unchanged.

167
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:42,900
Colonel.

168
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,260
Does that mean we should

169
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:46,420
restore the left arm
of the Tallgeese?

170
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,350
[CHIEF ENGINEER:]
There's still time

171

to take the supply parts off 01.

00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,880
This is a continuation
of our last battle.

175
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,100
Tallgeese had its left arm
damaged in Siberia.

176
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
So this will be
a valid handicap.

Hey Jim.

between Chief
Engineers and Pilots.

180

I suppose so.

That's a long time
for a meaningless battle.

I dunno the details,
but OZ is after you people.

206

What's the point of two sides
with a mutual enemy

fighting each other out here?

You think it's the pilots' fate?

But they've been out
to kill each other until now.

So naturally they feel
it is some kind of fate.

This battle will go on

until they both realize
it is meaningless.

215

Are people trying to stop time

Right now we've lost sight of
how to protect the colonies.

We really can't afford
to be wasting time here.

322
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,080
Brother? He's my brother?

323
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,550
[NOIN:] Ever since the
Peacecraft Monarchy

324
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:00,760
fell to the Alliance. he's had
his heart set on revenge.

325
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,340
Given the difficulties of
assembling power

326
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,660
from within the ruined
Sanc Kingdom,

327
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:09,716
he chose to join OZ to get
closer to the Alliance

328
00:19:09,885 --> 00:19:10,570
and waited,

329
00:19:10,570 --> 00:19:13,400
donning a disguise
he called Zechs Merquise.

330
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,910
[ZECHS:] My hands
have been stained

331
00:19:15,910 --> 00:19:16,960
with too much blood.

332
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:19,080
Relena is the appropriate person

333
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:20,880
to revive the Sanc Kingdom.

334
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:25,510
[NOIN:] Once OZ brought a
new wave of chaos to the world,

335
00:19:25,510 --> 00:19:28,600
Zechs must've lost the
sense of purpose in his life.

336
00:19:28,600 --> 00:19:31,400
Now he can only find
the soldier in himself

337
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,160
when he fights the Gundams.

338
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,740
That's what this
battle is all about.

339
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,240
Heero lives by his own rules.

340
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,680
And Zechs searching for
the spirit to battle him

341
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:41,960
on a level playing field.

342
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,970
So once again he’ll be able
to embrace the Sanc Kingdom

343
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,340
and the Peacecraft name.

344
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,160
He's even prepared
to lose his life for this.

345
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,560
I'll keep believing in him.

346
00:19:55,560 --> 00:19:57,800
I want to stay by his side.

347
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:00,840
No matter what he does
or what he searches for.

348
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,770
You're fond of my brother,

349
00:20:02,770 --> 00:20:04,120
aren’t you Noin?

350
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:07,020
Yes. I do love him.

351
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:10,020
[RELENA:] Please watch
over my brother forever.

352
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,620
I don't know if I’m able to.

353
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:15,360
Colonel Zechs can be
reckless at times.

354
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,740
It must be in the
Peacecraft blood.

355
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,850
A number of attack carriers

356
00:20:22,850 --> 00:20:25,080
are approaching us
rapidly from 3 o'clock!

357
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,080
[OZ SOLDIER:] I believe
they’re from the search party!

358
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:28,200
How many?

359
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,880
[OZ SOLDIER:]
I’ve confirmed over thirty,

360
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,500
but that's only a
portion of their fleet.

361
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:33,740
Get all the mobile suits ready!

362
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:35,180
Prepare to attack them!

363
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:43,780
They're here!

364
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:45,200
[TROWA:] Can you hear me,

365
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,120
Heero and Zechs?

366
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,620
There are about
thirty suits in flight.

367
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:50,530
A hundred if they
unload all Aries suits

368
00:20:50,530 --> 00:20:51,400
from the carriers.

369
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:55,160
We should be able to handle
thirty each, pretty easily.

370
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,020
[ZECHS:] No, wait!

371
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,880
I'll attract them all myself!

372
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,600
Glory to all the colonies!

373
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,500
No, Zechs!

374
00:21:04,820 --> 00:21:05,600
[ZECHS:] Heero!

375
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,740
We'll meet again to
continue our battle!

376
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,350
[TROWA:] He'll be
one tough guy to fight

377
00:21:13,350 --> 00:21:13,900
from now on.

378
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,660
Yeah, you’re right.

379
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:30,920
Colonel Zechs.

380
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:33,920
Our Aries troops are all
prepared to go into battle.

381
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:35,640
Then take Relena with you

382
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:37,100
and make your escape.

383
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:38,220
[NOIN:] Zechs!

384
00:21:38,660 --> 00:21:41,100
Once I know you've
gotten away safely,

385
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,520
I'll surrender myself.

386
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,520
[NOIN:] Then I'm
gonna fight too!

387
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,660
Noin!

388
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:48,660
Please let me protect
the promising leader

389
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:49,880
of the Sanc Kingdom!

390
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:51,880
Allow me to protect her!

391
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,560
I understand, Colonel.

392
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:06,560
Colonel, take care.

393
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,500
I don't care how it happened.

394
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,740
I'm just glad that
battle's finally over.

395
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,520
The war zone expands
into outer space.

396
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,906
As OZ moves to destroy the
remnants of the Alliance

397
00:23:45,075 --> 00:23:45,710
Military,

398
00:23:45,710 --> 00:23:48,640
it also makes plans
to reconcile the colonies.

399
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,590
Quatre and Duo decide
to head for outer space

400
00:23:51,590 --> 00:23:54,220
to warn the colonies
of OZ's conspiracy.

401
00:23:54,220 --> 00:23:56,930
But the colonies that
had been once their home

402
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:58,580
declare the Gundams
their enemies.

403
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:01,820
Next, on Gundam Wing Episode 17

404
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,900
Betrayed by Home, Far Away
