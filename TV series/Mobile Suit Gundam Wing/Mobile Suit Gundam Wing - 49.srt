2
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:31,543
In the year After Colony 175,

3
00:01:31,543 --> 00:01:34,340
the leader of the colonies
was assassinated.

4
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,323
Five Gundams

5
00:01:35,323 --> 00:01:38,660
were supposed to have been
sent to Earth to take revenge.

6
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,633
However, since OZ's
activities in space

7
00:01:41,633 --> 00:01:45,100
took the form of cooperation,
rather than control,

8
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,460
the colonies decided to accept OZ.

9
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:51,960
In the year After Colony 195.

10
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,750
As OZ moves to take over
both the Earth and outer space,

11
00:01:55,750 --> 00:02:00,080
the Gundams are labeled as rebels
and are isolated from society.

12
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:03,345
With no place to return,

13
00:02:03,345 --> 00:02:06,546
the Gundams and their
pilots are forced to fight

14
00:02:06,546 --> 00:02:09,820
for a reason to exist in
the ever‐changing world.

15
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,260
It's an astro suit!

16
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:17,840
The astro suit has been
set as a target!

17
00:02:19,260 --> 00:02:20,800
Cancel it! Hurry!

18
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:27,300
[HEERO:] I’ll eliminate
all obstacles.

19
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,280
[NARRATOR:] The Lunar
Base Infiltration

20
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,640
[DUO:] Did you say lunar base?

21
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,240
[HEERO:] Yes.

22
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,946
There’s a large amount of
Gundanium alloy

23
00:02:43,946 --> 00:02:46,200
being brought into the
Lunar Base factory.

24
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:49,500
It's probably for making a
new type of mobile suit.

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:51,820
[DUO:] So what are your plans?

26
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,980
You'll get in the way.
Just stay here.

27
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,980
What do you mean?

28
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,001
Considering everything
that's happened lately,

29
00:03:01,001 --> 00:03:03,020
I am gonna need time to recover.

30
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:05,041
But don’t you think you could be

31
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,300
a little kinder to me
once in a while?

32
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:10,120
[HEERO:] Why not go to
school instead of me?

33
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:12,613
I've already got the
enrollment taken care of,

34
00:03:12,613 --> 00:03:13,480
under your name.

35
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,220
[DUO:] What?

36
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,700
You've gotta be kidding!

37
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,760
Sure, your name would stick
out too much here, but still!

38
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,623
[HEERO:] Instead of complaining,

39
00:03:20,623 --> 00:03:22,401
why not spend your time resting

40
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:24,580
and concentrating on getting
better?

41
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,500
[DUO:] Don't overdo it.

42
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,080
Like he's gonna listen.

43
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:31,860
Of course he’s gonna overdo it.

44
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:34,698
[HEERO:] I'll decide once I
get to the moon

45
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:37,660
whether to steal the new
mobile suit or destroy it.

46
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,913
[NARRATOR:] With only one
sixth of the gravity of Earth,

47
00:03:43,913 --> 00:03:47,320
the moon was not an appropriate
place for humans to reside.

48
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,888
Upon completion of the
Space Colonies,

49
00:03:49,888 --> 00:03:53,225
construction was started
on lunar research facilities

50
00:03:53,225 --> 00:03:55,560
and major factories for
various uses.

51
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,396
The moon further developed

52
00:03:57,396 --> 00:04:01,555
into a popular outer space tourist
destination for people from Earth,

53
00:04:01,555 --> 00:04:05,540
and prospered significantly until
the suppression by the Alliance.

54
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,881
After OZ’s dismantling of the
Alliance Military was complete,

55
00:04:12,881 --> 00:04:15,976
the moon was again
allowed to conduct business

56
00:04:15,976 --> 00:04:17,660
as a tourist destination.

57
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,400
People took this to be a sign that
peace was returning to space.

58
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,540
[DOKTOR S:] People are now free
to travel between the colonies.

59
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,280
It seems that OZ has already
seized much of outer space.

60
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:34,268
They've been handing out
a lot of gifts these days

61
00:04:34,268 --> 00:04:36,120
to try and win the people over.

62
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,160
Once the people trust OZ,
the rest is easy.

63
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,811
Before you know it, the
resources and labor

64
00:04:41,811 --> 00:04:43,600
will all be controlled by OZ.

65
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,481
[PROFESSOR G:] Why
don’t we build OZ

66
00:04:46,481 --> 00:04:48,320
a real rascal to keep
them occupied?

67
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,385
My, the defense system
for the Mercurius

68
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:58,200
is looking pretty impressive.

69
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,153
And the Vayeate should
start taking shape

70
00:05:00,153 --> 00:05:02,200
once the mainframe is
finished being built.

71
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,426
[PROFESSOR G:] It’s only a matter
of time before it's completed,

72
00:05:06,426 --> 00:05:09,120
I don't intend to work
under OZ’s orders forever.

73
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:12,480
Officially speaking,
this is Lady Une's project.

74
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,453
But I understand they'll
be selecting mobile suit pilots

75
00:05:15,453 --> 00:05:17,100
from among the colony citizens.

76
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:20,080
This could all become
quite interesting indeed.

77
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,080
Oh, I doubt if things are
going to work out that well.

78
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,480
Heero for one won't bother
with the selection process.

79
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:30,180
It's more like his style to
go straight for their throats.

80
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:33,076
In any case we'll complete the
powerful

81
00:05:33,245 --> 00:05:35,220
mobile suits that OZ wants so bad.

82
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,065
And then prove to OZ that even
they can

83
00:05:38,233 --> 00:05:40,180
be destroyed by their own weapons!

84
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,040
[CHATTER]

85
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,251
Is OZ really thinking about
establishing

86
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,680
a nation in outer space?

87
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,653
Now that we're free from
the control of the Alliance,

88
00:05:53,653 --> 00:05:55,923
civilians are once again able to
communicate

89
00:05:56,091 --> 00:05:58,100
between the colonies and with the
Earth.

90
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:01,060
It’s true that we have OZ
to thank for that.

91
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:02,790
But I can’t see any need for them

92
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,900
to tell us what to do with our
future.

93
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,458
Perhaps, but given the present
size of the Space Colonies

94
00:06:08,458 --> 00:06:12,140
it'd be unnatural for us not
to consider becoming a nation.

95
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,260
That's right, but this is our
problem right here.

96
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:18,708
It says our main industries
will be military technology

97
00:06:18,708 --> 00:06:20,400
and mobile suit production.

98
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,600
[NICHOL:] Colonel.

99
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,255
The colony delegates
seem to be having problems

100
00:06:24,255 --> 00:06:26,120
with that document, as we feared.

101
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,440
That seems natural.

102
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,826
They've seen the Alliance's
reckless use

103
00:06:29,995 --> 00:06:31,900
of armaments time and time again.

104
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,465
To them, a mobile suit
manufacturer is

105
00:06:34,633 --> 00:06:36,860
probably like a merchant of death.

106
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:39,528
The nations supporting OZ are
only interested

107
00:06:39,696 --> 00:06:40,683
in space
technology

108
00:06:40,683 --> 00:06:43,500
because they can use it
to improve military power.

109
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,140
I can't see the peace‐minded
colonies going along with it.

110
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,306
Well, they can think of our plan
for

111
00:06:49,475 --> 00:06:51,500
the armaments as a kind of
deterrent.

112
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,718
Arrangements will be made soon
enough

113
00:06:53,886 --> 00:06:55,700
to bring in what space is
lacking.

114
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:57,360
What space is lacking?

115
00:06:58,180 --> 00:06:59,940
Proper public order.

116
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,000
[COLONEL UNE:] Sorry to
keep you all waiting, everybody.

117
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,468
Have you had a chance to read
through

118
00:07:07,636 --> 00:07:08,860
the document in front of
you?

119
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,663
I believe one of the reasons
the Space Colonies

120
00:07:11,663 --> 00:07:13,420
were considered a threat to Earth

121
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:15,363
was due to the fact that the
colonies

122
00:07:15,531 --> 00:07:17,580
lacked a clear organizational
structure.

123
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,520
I think forming a nation is a
step in the right direction.

124
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,900
But you're having problems with
the major industries, aren’t you?

125
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:26,380
That’s just it.

126
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,960
How can there be world peace based
on this idea

127
00:07:29,128 --> 00:07:31,320
that armaments are needed as a
deterrent?

128
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:34,080
We’ve learned otherwise
from past history.

129
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,106
It’s possible we can establish a
new

130
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:38,360
public order different from the
Earth.

131
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,445
We're proud that this technology
will be the source of our capital

132
00:07:42,445 --> 00:07:45,540
but we shouldn't be
thinking about military power.

133
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,915
Deep in my heart,

134
00:07:46,915 --> 00:07:51,120
I honestly feel this war has
already come to an end.

135
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,940
OZ is a military organization.

136
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,140
We've made an effort to settle
repeated disputes on Earth.

137
00:07:57,140 --> 00:07:59,066
There was a time when the goal
of the

138
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:00,633
United Earth Sphere
Alliance

139
00:08:00,633 --> 00:08:03,578
was to achieve peace without
relying on military power,

140
00:08:03,578 --> 00:08:05,080
like you're suggesting today

141
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:08,700
But just think what those
strategies gave rise to.

142
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,640
There is no need for
reckless battle.

143
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,835
But how can you talk about
the beauty of humankind

144
00:08:14,835 --> 00:08:17,200
without acknowledging the
will to fight?

145
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:21,080
Am I the only one who
admires man's will to fight?

146
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:41,140
[SALLY:] I hadn't expected
OZ to restore it to this extent.

147
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:43,820
But I can't hand this

That’s just what I was
gonna ask you.

You've gotta be some

to sneak in here at night

00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:15,080
That doesn’t make me happy,
but that Gundam's impressive!

160
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,180
Damn! She's pretty aggressive!

161
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:20,380
OZ has found us!

162
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:21,540
Let's get outta here!

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:22,300
No way!

164
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,100
We've gotta be at least as
brave as that lady just was!

165
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,023
We have to take back Master
Quatre's

166
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,680
Gundam if it means our lives!

167
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,840
[OZ SOLDIER:] Leo troops,
get a move on!

168
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,520
The enemy's in the
hangar with Gundam 04!

169
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:41,160
There it is!

170
00:09:47,740 --> 00:09:50,980
We barely managed to sneak in
and look what happens!

171
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:53,740
Abdul's plans never work the
way they’re supposed to!

172
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,100
What was that you said?

173
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:57,483
I don’t have much time, buddy, so
get

174
00:09:57,651 --> 00:09:59,840
Master Quatre's Gundam here
pronto!

175
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,100
Come on! What's taking
you so long, Auda?

176
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:11,120
You fool! Don't fight
right beside me!

177
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:13,320
It wasn't easy swiping
this carrier!

178
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,400
Don't blame me!

179
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,948
We were initially supposed to wait
it out until

180
00:10:17,116 --> 00:10:18,240
OZ rebuilt the
Gundam!

181
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,300
I didn't expect things would
get moving this quickly!

182
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:22,660
Hurry up, Ahmad!

183
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,320
I hear you!

184
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,700
[EXPLOSIONS]

185
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,520
How’s that?

186
00:10:40,580 --> 00:10:41,840
Perfect! We did it!

187
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,840
Mission accomplished!

188
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,840
What's that?

189
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,240
What's the matter?

190
00:10:53,240 --> 00:10:54,260
Why'd you stop?

191
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:56,620
Damn it all!

192
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:00,160
[SALLY:] Don't even think
about fighting!

193
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,840
It's that bloody woman again!

194
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,740
Hey, that's Auda!

195
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:07,980
I really don't think that
we're enemies!

196
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:09,100
I sensed that.

197
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:11,555
But the guy I know would try to
destroy

198
00:11:11,723 --> 00:11:13,480
the Gundam in this
situation.

199
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:17,300
Well, the guy I know would
be sad if it were destroyed.

200
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,300
We're hoping to restore it to its
original state to make him happy.

201
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,660
Does she know a Gundam
pilot as well?

202
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,800
Hey! We belong to the Maguanac
Corps of the Middle East!

203
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,260
I beg you, please leave this
Gundam in our hands!

204
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:33,860
Sounds like a great kid,
this pilot of yours.

205
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,920
As does your pilot.

206
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,731
Now, I'd better go and pick up
what

207
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,880
the next great kid left behind.

208
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,823
[NEWSCASTER:] The following
footage is of an event held today

209
00:12:05,823 --> 00:12:08,200
that is very significant for the
defense of the colonies.

210
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:11,075
These young volunteers
are vying for a position

211
00:12:11,075 --> 00:12:13,520
to fight for the safety
of the colonies.

212
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:18,820
Why is everyone going along
with OZ's every word?

213
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:22,055
[NEWSCASTER:] The youngsters
produced satisfactory results

214
00:12:22,055 --> 00:12:24,900
in a firing test designed
to reflect a real battle.

215
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,885
In the next test,

216
00:12:27,885 --> 00:12:30,015
obstacles representing enemies
will be

217
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,200
placed along each mobile suit's
path.

218
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:34,100
The bombs we’re using
are imitations.

219
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:36,940
But they’ll give you quite a
significant shock when they hit.

220
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,940
Be careful!

221
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:38,880
[INITIATES:] Yes, sir!

222
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,840
[NICHOL:] Here they come!

223
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Commence counter‐attack!

224
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,320
What a disaster.

225
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
But they are just amateurs.

226
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,840
Wow, I don't believe that guy!

227
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:14,900
What's with him?

228
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:17,740
This is test pilot 1.

229
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,180
I'm finished with the test.

230
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:21,840
Test pilot 1, confirm your name!

231
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:25,340
I told you: Trowa Barton.

232
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,520
[NICHOL:] Colonel, Trowa
Barton is extraordinary!

233
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,000
Even though this is a simulation,

234
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,936
it’s unthinkable that he’d be able
to make

235
00:13:33,105 --> 00:13:34,900
maneuvers like that in his first
battle!

236
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,640
What are you implying?

237
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:38,860
[NICHOL:] He must've had
some previous training.

238
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,860
At an extremely high level, too!

239
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,000
But his background has
been checked hasn't it?

240
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:45,920
[NICHOL:] Yes, and there
were no problems.

241
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:49,720
Then it sounds like he's got
some natural talents.

242
00:13:49,860 --> 00:13:53,200
Talents that he never had the
chance to use up until today.

243
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:56,580
[NICHOL:] But isn't it possible
that he's been sent to destroy OZ?

244
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,760
He might even be a Gundam pilot!

245
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:01,420
We'll find out about
that soon enough.

246
00:14:03,280 --> 00:14:04,260
[COLONEL UNE:] Trowa Barton.

247
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:05,800
We have one additional test.

248
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,220
Completely destroy
the next target!

249
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,280
[TROWA:] But that’s the...

250
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,220
What the hell?

251
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,620
[NICHOL:] What's the matter,
Trowa Barton?

252
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,160
Fire at the target!!

253
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,380
Colonel!

254
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:33,780
He is a Gundam pilot,
just as I figured!

255
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:35,420
I'll get rid of him!

256
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:38,620
[TROWA:] Lend me that beam cannon.

257
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:39,600
[NICHOL:] What?

258
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:43,040
It's made of Gundanium alloy.

259
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:45,940
A Leo rifle isn’t
gonna do the job.

260
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:47,061
[NEWSCASTER:] A Gundam,

261
00:14:47,061 --> 00:14:48,843
responsible for the
misunderstandings

262
00:14:49,011 --> 00:14:50,400
between Earth and the colonies

263
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:53,233
is about to be destroyed by
the hands of a colony citizen

264
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,280
who wishes for peace.

265
00:14:54,280 --> 00:14:56,343
Ladies and gentlemen, stand by to
witness

266
00:14:56,511 --> 00:14:58,320
this very exciting moment in
history.

267
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,400
Hey, listen Deathscythe!

268
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,140
Don't give up too easily.

269
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,880
You’re gonna be okay, right?

270
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,860
You're gonna come out just fine.

271
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:09,080
About to commence the second test.

272
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,940
[DUO:] No! Noooooo!

273
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:37,280
Trowa Barton: brain waves and
pulse both remain unchanged.

274
00:15:37,280 --> 00:15:39,280
Then he's the perfect pilot.

275
00:15:39,280 --> 00:15:41,960
But I still have some doubts
about him, Colonel Une.

276
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:45,140
That boy is clearly willing
to cooperate with OZ.

277
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,040
Talented people are capable
of understanding us.

278
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:52,280
[TROWA:] Huh? What's this?

279
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:56,580
Those sparkles...

280
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,080
They're my tears.

281
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:13,860
The most recent version
of mobile suits.

282
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:16,800
Many of the parts are still
being designed.

283
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,640
I'll go destroy them.

284
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:30,345
[NICHOL:] No. 1 test pilot,

285
00:16:30,345 --> 00:16:32,720
Colonel Une wishes to speak
with you, wait right there.

286
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:36,340
I understand.

287
00:16:38,420 --> 00:16:39,820
Wait, Colonel Une!

288
00:16:39,820 --> 00:16:40,820
Be careful!

289
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:44,240
It's possible that he could
still be a Gundam pilot!

290
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,560
I think it would be wiser for me
to meet with him by myself.

291
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:49,420
Huh?

292
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:52,380
He's come to try and
understand OZ.

293
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,700
It'd be rude not to meet with him.

294
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,760
I'm sure we'll have a lot
to talk about,

295
00:16:57,760 --> 00:17:00,080
as two individuals who
love outer space.

296
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,040
Colonel?

297
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:04,420
Lieutenant Nichol, what
are you so afraid of?

298
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,100
Please, Colonel.

299
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,340
Let's put an end to the fighting,
shall we?

300
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,020
My name is Lady Une.

301
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,520
It's a pleasure to meet you.

302
00:17:20,120 --> 00:17:21,680
[TROWA:] So this is Lady Une.

303
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,400
Chief Commander of OZ's
Space Operations.

304
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:28,901
I understand you've had
experience with labor mobile suits

305
00:17:28,901 --> 00:17:31,140
in your job repairing the
colony's outer walls.

306
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:33,445
Your outstanding test results
today have

307
00:17:33,613 --> 00:17:35,860
even the OZ soldiers completely
baffled.

308
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:39,220
I've always felt I that had what
it would take to be a soldier.

309
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,540
So does that mean you’re
going to hire me?

310
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:44,580
Let's work together to bring
peace to outer space.

311
00:17:44,920 --> 00:17:47,570
I'm just hoping that my
abilities will come in handy

312
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:49,660
in defeating the
Alliance's Space Forces.

313
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:52,480
I'd never really given thought
to peace in outer space.

314
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,340
I thought that alone qualified me
as the right type of person for
OZ.

315
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,180
The right type of person?

316
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,758
[TROWA:] I'm
impressed with the way

317
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:04,140
OZ is gradually taking over space
while
appearing to act out of
friendship.

318
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:08,140
People may think of it as foul
play, but it suits me just fine.

319
00:18:08,940 --> 00:18:10,140
Taking over?

320
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:11,680
What do you mean, “foul play”?

321
00:18:11,680 --> 00:18:14,740
OZ is a place where the
crafty are acknowledged.

322
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:16,440
That's what it's about.

323
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,380
No.

324
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,740
Oh no.

325
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:25,020
It's not true!

326
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,020
[UNE HYPERVENTILATING]

327
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,240
Colonel!

328
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,940
She really needs to get some rest!

329
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,940
Please, this way, Colonel.

330
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,160
What happened to her?

331
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,760
You might have tricked the
Colonel, but you didn’t trick me.

332
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,180
Trowa Barton.

333
00:18:42,180 --> 00:18:45,513
The Colonel has ordered you
to come back in two hours

334
00:18:45,513 --> 00:18:47,400
to test OZ's new mobile suits.

335
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,200
But just now the Colonel...

336
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,360
Lady Une is a much stronger
person in her uniform.

337
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:55,700
She might feel like killing
someone as questionable as you.

338
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,740
So I'm Lady Une of OZ?

339
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:16,440
Or do I work under Mr. Treize?

340
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:32,260
[PROFESSOR G:] Didn't take you
long to find your pilots, did it?

341
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:35,493
These five have been selected
from the citizens of the colony

342
00:19:35,493 --> 00:19:36,660
as prospective pilots.

343
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,380
And meet Trowa Barton.

344
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:40,780
He's got outstanding skills.

345
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,160
He should be able to
control any suit.

346
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:46,900
These mobile suits of ours
won't be simple to control.

347
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,080
I hear they're better
than the Gundams.

348
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,240
I can't wait.

349
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,860
How far have you progressed?

350
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,683
[DOCTOR J:] The Mercurius
is 80% complete

351
00:19:55,683 --> 00:19:58,300
and the Vayeate is
about 50% complete.

352
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:00,180
[COLONEL UNE:] What is the reason

353
00:20:00,348 --> 00:20:01,920
for developing two
different models?

354
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,845
With these two models we
designed the mobile suits

355
00:20:04,845 --> 00:20:07,665
with the basic attack and
defense stances in mind

356
00:20:07,665 --> 00:20:09,740
and took them all to
their extremes.

357
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:13,295
With the Vayeate, we added
the largest beam cannon we could

358
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:14,920
without affecting its mobility.

359
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:17,420
And with the Mercurius
we added a defense shield

360
00:20:17,420 --> 00:20:20,180
capable of withstanding an
attack by the beam cannon.

361
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,380
Which would win if they were
to fight against each other?

362
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:27,280
[DOCTOR J:] Naturally, the one
with the better pilot would win.

363
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:28,360
Who are you kidding?

364
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:30,400
So the race to determine
the superiority

365
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:31,980
of mobile suits is meaningless,

366
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,906
since their value is directly
dependent

367
00:20:34,075 --> 00:20:35,500
on the abilities of the pilot?

368
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,760
You're pretty sharp, I see why
you were selected by OZ.

369
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,240
You're exactly right!

370
00:20:41,240 --> 00:20:42,560
Silence now!

371
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,760
Leave him alone!

372
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,640
He'll be piloting one
of those suits.

373
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:47,080
I'll allow his questions.

374
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:48,880
Uh, yes ma'am.

375
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:51,960
So what kind of tests will you
be demonstrating for us today?

376
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:52,740
Right!

377
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,420
I'll show you the defense system
employed by the Mercurius.

378
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:00,126
It creates an electric field to
allow it to reflect any beam

379
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,300
fired by the enemy.

380
00:21:01,300 --> 00:21:03,060
What about the Vayeate?

381
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,460
The Vayeate still needs
some work done.

382
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,120
The energy charger isn’t
even installed.

383
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:09,880
Hmm? What's that?

384
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,220
The Vayeate's moving!

385
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,940
Activate the Mercurius shield!

386
00:21:20,940 --> 00:21:21,820
I’ve got it!

387
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,240
Colonel!

388
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,680
Hey, you gonna make it?

389
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:05,160
Ouch, that hurt.

390
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,300
What'd I tell you?

391
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,680
My weapon is something,
don't you think?

392
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,280
That's for sure.

393
00:22:10,280 --> 00:22:12,020
The suit came after us!

394
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:14,020
That's some weapon, all right.

395
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:38,280
[ENDING MUSIC]

396
00:23:36,980 --> 00:23:40,300
A white mobile suit is
seen approaching a colony.

397
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,771
Once it's determined to be the
Tallgeese belonging to Zechs,

398
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,540
Lady Une orders Trowa
and Heero to attack it.

399
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:50,255
About that time, the injured
Quatre

400
00:23:50,423 --> 00:23:52,580
returns home to the Winner
residence.

401
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:56,366
But what he finds is the
sad image of his father

402
00:23:56,366 --> 00:23:59,640
being solely blamed and
criticized by the people.

403
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,300
Next, on Gundam Wing Episode 21,

404
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:05,620
Grief‐stricken Quatre.
