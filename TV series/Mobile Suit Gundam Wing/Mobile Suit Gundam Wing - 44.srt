That's beautiful! I didn’t expect
you

00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:24,853
to be a talented musician Quatre.

12
00:02:25,271 --> 00:02:28,151
[QUATRE:] I have been fond of
music since I was a young boy.

13
00:02:28,315 --> 00:02:30,103
I enjoy playing instruments
because

14
00:02:30,271 --> 00:02:31,903
they always make me feel relaxed.

15
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,530
[NOIN:] That song was very
melancholy though.

16
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:39,578
You must not keep blaming
yourself for what's happened.

17
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:42,713
When there's a war going on,
some things can’t be helped.

18
00:02:42,871 --> 00:02:45,515
It can't be brushed aside as
something inevitable.

19
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:48,940
Wars are paid with human lives!
If I'd been a stronger person

20

happened to Trowa.

Miss Noin don't you have some
information for me about Oz?

23
00:03:03,768 --> 00:03:04,278
Of course.

24
00:03:04,446 --> 00:03:07,761
The whereabouts of Treize is
still unknown but Oz considers the

25
00:03:07,896 --> 00:03:10,186
Treize Faction as retaliators and
battles

26
00:03:10,355 --> 00:03:12,193
around the world are intensifying.

27
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:14,883
[NOIN:] However, Oz still
has the advantage.

28
00:03:15,028 --> 00:03:17,816
There's no way the average pilot
can compete

29
00:03:17,985 --> 00:03:20,326
with the capabilities of mobile
dolls.

30
00:03:20,785 --> 00:03:23,913
I'd think we stand a decent
chance against the mobile dolls.

31
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,706
I'm not merely bragging.

32
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:30,615
We could only do it with superior
mobile suits like the Gundams.

33
00:03:30,783 --> 00:03:31,586
That's a fact!

34
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,355
But even if we destroyed the
mobile dolls in battle,

35
00:03:35,523 --> 00:03:37,135
the war wouldn't come to
an end.

36
00:03:37,635 --> 00:03:40,921
If there's one thing we've learned
through our experiences,

37
00:03:41,055 --> 00:03:43,390
it's that there's a limit to what
a pilot can accomplish.

38
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,916
Won't Miss Relena, won't the Sanc
Kingdom

39
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:48,935
be able to comfort
soldiers,

40
00:03:49,063 --> 00:03:50,690
such as yourself Quatre?

41
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,666
I'm sure that one could
feel relaxed here.

42
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,000
Perhaps that's why people like
ourselves

43
00:03:56,168 --> 00:03:58,571
who are tainted with blood
shouldn't be here.

44
00:03:59,073 --> 00:04:01,241

00:10:46,090 --> 00:10:47,866
this country's ideas are
dangerous,

153
00:10:48,023 --> 00:10:51,901
who knows what they might do to
her. Heero!

154
00:11:04,915 --> 00:11:07,166
[QUATRE:] Heero, what are
you trying to do?

155
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:11,673
A large number of mobile dolls are
expected to arrive in Luxembourg.

156
00:11:11,838 --> 00:11:12,923
What?

157
00:11:13,381 --> 00:11:16,248
[HEERO:] The Treize Faction’s
headquarters are in Luxembourg,

158
00:11:16,385 --> 00:11:19,430
it looks like Romefeller is trying
to crush them all at once.

159
00:11:19,638 --> 00:11:22,628
They’re gonna send this many
mobile dolls to earth?

160
00:11:22,796 --> 00:11:24,841
Even Luxembourg won’t have
a chance!

161
00:11:24,976 --> 00:11:27,326
Once the battle is won those
mobile dolls

162
00:11:27,495 --> 00:11:29,440
will be dispersed across the
world.

163
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,426
You’re crazy!

164
00:11:30,595 --> 00:11:33,735
Even you can’t defeat
so many Mobile Dolls by yourself.

165
00:11:34,736 --> 00:11:37,196
If you’re going, then I’m
going with you.

166
00:11:37,448 --> 00:11:39,031
[HEERO:] No, you stay here.

167
00:11:39,325 --> 00:11:40,138
[QUATRE:] But why??

168
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,268
You can’t afford to get killed
this stage in the game,

169
00:11:43,436 --> 00:11:44,830
not until you
find Trowa.

170
00:12:03,306 --> 00:12:06,226
What’s going on here Quatre?
Where's Heero?

171
00:12:07,853 --> 00:12:10,886
Heero has made a decision.
He’s chosen to fight where

172
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,150
he has the least
chance of survival.

173
00:12:40,928 --> 00:12:44,201
That’s an unbelievable number of
suits just to destroy one base.

174
00:12:44,348 --> 00:12:46,806
Which merely proves what a
strategic point

175
00:12:46,975 --> 00:12:48,250
the Luxembourg base is.

176
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,926
I guess if they were fighting
against the Lightning Count

177
00:12:51,063 --> 00:12:53,050
then they would have to have
that many dolls.

178
00:12:53,190 --> 00:12:54,961
I'm going to fight them with
everything

179
00:12:55,130 --> 00:12:56,901
I've got no matter what their
plans are.

180
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,858
[ZECHS:] Luxembourg.

181
00:13:00,026 --> 00:13:02,720
I previously fought
to take it over from the Alliance,

182
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,618
now I'm fighting to defend it.
Talk about irony.

183
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,106
Zechs has arrived, just
as we suspected.

184
00:13:20,258 --> 00:13:22,025
All shuttles ignore the Tallgeese

185
00:13:22,193 --> 00:13:24,121
and head straight for the
atmosphere.

186
00:13:24,263 --> 00:13:27,056
We must conquer
Luxembourg at all costs!

187

[DERMAIL:] Welcome, Miss
Relena Peacecraft!

188
00:13:46,076 --> 00:13:48,286
[RELENA:] Thank you very
much for inviting me today.

I'm so pleased to be able to meet

Many thanks for your help Dorothy.

I am delighted to be of

luck Miss Relena.

<i>you can show us</i>

195
00:14:12,418 --> 00:14:13,770
<i>just what you’re</i>
<i>made of.</i>

196
00:14:15,146 --> 00:14:16,981
<i>Don't disappoint me.</i>

197
00:14:18,525 --> 00:14:21,238
[RELENA:] It's a fact that the
Sanc Kingdom can’t employ its

198
00:14:21,403 --> 00:14:23,321
peace initiatives without
your assistance.

199
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:26,656
But your Oz organization is
initiating

200
00:14:26,825 --> 00:14:28,576
wars all around the world.

201
00:14:29,911 --> 00:14:34,583
How could the Romefeller
foundation power
produce two completely different
results?

202
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:40,046
It’s because the decision on how
to use
all this power is made by people,
right?

203
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:46,928
If peace is truly your objective,
I ask that
you use our Sanc Kingdom as your
model.

204
00:14:47,596 --> 00:14:52,225
I am fully prepared to assist you
in
achieving your peace objectives.

205
00:15:00,566 --> 00:15:01,491
That was wonderful.

206
00:15:01,651 --> 00:15:05,113
You have very sound beliefs
for a woman as young as yourself.

207
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:09,370
But I can’t ignore the hypocrisies
within the Sanc Kingdom.

208
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:11,245
What hypocrisies do you mean?

209
00:15:11,828 --> 00:15:13,590
[DERMAIL:] Let me explain:

210
00:15:13,758 --> 00:15:17,641
recently a certain individual has
been attacking Oz troops

211
00:15:17,793 --> 00:15:20,211
and leaving us with
considerable damage.

212
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:22,990
He’s approached the colonies as

213
00:15:23,158 --> 00:15:25,841
ambassador Milliardo Peacecraft
of the Sanc Kingdom

214
00:15:26,176 --> 00:15:28,866
but later he appeared as
Zechs Marquise,

215
00:15:29,035 --> 00:15:30,305
the Tallgeese
pilot.

216
00:15:30,513 --> 00:15:33,933
[DERMAIL:] He’s currently
considered an enemy of Oz!

217
00:15:39,565 --> 00:15:42,441
[ZECHS:] Damn it is responding
too slowly. Huh??

218
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:54,413
Fighting against Oz is the
same as opposing Romefeller.

219
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:57,571
Is it safe to assume that the Sanc
Kingdom

220
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,626
has some aggressive
ambitions?

221
00:16:01,795 --> 00:16:05,423
Is that pilot still calling
himself Milliardo Peacecraft?

222
00:16:06,216 --> 00:16:08,176
Well, no he isn't.

223
00:16:08,343 --> 00:16:11,450
Then he's clearly not
my elder brother Milliardo.

224
00:16:11,996 --> 00:16:15,891
[RELENA:] ‐The Peacecraft family
wants nothing more than peace.

225
00:16:16,143 --> 00:16:18,725
As a family member it's impossible
for him

226
00:16:18,893 --> 00:16:20,855
to pilot a mobile suit and
fight.

227
00:16:21,523 --> 00:16:23,691
[DERMAIL:] Then you don't
care what happens to him?

228
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,861
[RELENA:] It has nothing to do
with the Sanc Kingdom.

229
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:33,898
I understand that it appears that
we've made some false assumptions.

230
00:16:34,035 --> 00:16:35,830
We'll take appropriate measures

231
00:16:35,998 --> 00:16:38,498
and deal with this traitor Zechs
on our own.

232
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:41,738
My apologies for ever doubting
the Sanc Kingdom.

233
00:16:41,876 --> 00:16:43,370
[RELENA:] Now if you'd please

234
00:16:43,538 --> 00:16:45,505
excuse me
from this meeting, gentlemen.

235
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:53,721
The Sanc Kingdom. How frustrating.

236
00:16:58,810 --> 00:17:01,058
That was quite the show Miss
Relena.

237
00:17:01,226 --> 00:17:04,356
I could tell there was something
special about you.

238
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:12,066
[DOROTHY:] You can't use
dolls in a war,

239
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,910
it's meaningless unless its
fought between people.

240
00:17:15,660 --> 00:17:17,056
And for that to happen.

241
00:17:17,225 --> 00:17:19,915
There's a lot more for you
to do Miss Relena.

242
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,335
And for the time being,
you can count on my assistance.

243
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:33,803
[RELENA:] Milliardo, you
knew exactly what I would say.

244
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:36,931
That's why you chose to
fight as Zechs Marquise.

245
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:51,783
The escort mobile dolls
have been destroyed sir.

246
00:17:51,946 --> 00:17:54,898
But we sent the target number of
shuttles to earth.

247
00:17:55,066 --> 00:17:56,618
Luxembourg will surely
fall!

248
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:05,793
That's my limit.

249
00:18:06,253 --> 00:18:09,046
Luxembourg, don't be defeated.

250
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:22,560
Damn! That's gotta be one of
those new mobile dolls!

251
00:18:26,231 --> 00:18:30,110
Whats that? Gundam 01?
What’s it doing here!?

252
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:36,868
[NOIN:] They’ve started fighting
in Luxembourg.

253
00:18:37,036 --> 00:18:38,650
I thought that you wanted to go?

254
00:18:38,785 --> 00:18:40,700
Heero talked me out of going.

255
00:18:40,868 --> 00:18:44,248
I'll stay here and protect Relena
on Heero's behalf.

256
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:47,068
Maybe we're being overly cautious,
but if something

257
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:48,730
were to happen to Miss Relena,

258
00:18:48,898 --> 00:18:51,401
I couldn't bear the thought of
facing Zechs again.

Don’t worry about it Pagan.
