3
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,530
[NARRATOR] Treize Khushrenada
assumes the position as the
World Nation's sovereign

4
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:36,200
and once again accumulates all
military armaments on land. In
space the White Fang

5
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:42,400
completes its gigantic space
battleship Libra. With his
desire to eliminate Earth

6
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:48,400
commander Milliardo Peacecraft
proceeds with his plans
to enter into a

00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:54,400
fully fledged war with the
entire forces of the World
Nation led by Treize.

fight, not siding with anyone.
And right before

00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:04,800
them the largest battle yet to
be experienced by humanity
is about to begin.

[SOLDIER] Various damage to
spaceship structure.

16
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,673
This can't be happening. It
wasn't supposed to
happen like this.

17
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,511
[ZECHS] This was too much
responsibility for Dorothy.

18
00:02:50,045 --> 00:02:55,110
Hey Zechs... according to Zero
you have no future.

19

differently?

21
00:03:38,266 --> 00:03:44,080
OK it's all finished. You never
know when we'll have to
fight next right?

22
00:03:44,088 --> 00:03:47,200

25
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,578
I can still fight without it.

26
00:04:08,978 --> 00:04:11,950
[DUO] Heero be careful yourself.

27
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:17,330
I know you can control it now
but that doesn't change the fact
that it's a dangerous system.

28
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:19,200
You're right.

29
00:04:19,245 --> 00:04:23,066
I can't believe he agreed...

30
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:29,370
Hey you guys! I thought that I
told you to leave the repairs
to the mechanics.

31
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:33,860
[HOWARD] Don't forget it's your
duty as pilots to rest
when you can.

32
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:37,860
We know. Hey man I'm famished
let's grab something to eat.

33
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:39,333
Sounds good to me.

34
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:42,970
[SALLY] That's the natural
resource satellite MO‐2.

35
00:04:42,970 --> 00:04:46,978
They're done mining it so it's
been left circling
Earth's orbit.

36
00:04:46,978 --> 00:04:49,820
It would be perfect for a
frontline base.

37
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:54,840
Look at all of those mobile
suits. The World
Nation's been bringing

38
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,511
all the weapons from Earth to
this one location.

39
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:59,510
[SALLY] Sure looks that way.

40
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:03,330
Still it's astonishing that they
could assemble this many suits.

41
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,880
Does Treize Kushrenada honestly
expect that he's gonna

42
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,200
be able to settle this
war in space?

43
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:14,000
I really don't know. But they
have never done anything like
this before now though.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,200
What in the world could those
guys be thinking?

45
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,200
I wonder.

Now most of our military force
has been transferred.

arrive there.

should be ready in time for

an end to this prolonged fight.
By eliminating

54
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,200
the White Fang who is using
military force to disrupt our
peace we will bring calm

you'll fight your best

be mad at me but I'm gonna
fight my own way.

The repairs to Libra are
almost completely done.

and have everybody who is not on
duty get some rest.

the final battle?

rest too. Take over things here.

Commander Milliardo. What are we
going to do about the Gundams?

68

Leave them alone.

[QUINZE] Commander?!

The Peacemillion was hit pretty
hard. They'll be quiet
for the moment.

71
00:07:47,023 --> 00:07:51,320
But sir we can't just simply
leave them out there
because Epyon alone

72
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:56,320
is our Gundam symbol. Anything
else that might get in the
way of our ideal

73
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:58,040
must be destroyed immediately.

74

Can we do that?

00:08:00,133 --> 00:08:03,645
I've already sent mobile dolls
over there. I will defeat them.

Relena? Don't you find
it invigorating?

the air as people
prepare for war...

Are you worried about Mr.
Milliardo? I'm sure you must be

82
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:45,710

Why would my brother start a war
with a former friend

85
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:10,660
of his rather than
talking things over?

86
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:13,911
Because that is what they both
want to do. [RELENA] Huh?

87
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:18,310
It's just that you can't
understand how the two of
them must feel.

88
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:21,023
But that doesn't really
matter too much though.

What do you mean?

90
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,020
Look at those Ms. Relena.

91
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:26,711
What are they?

92
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:32,088
Mercurius and Vayeate. They're
mobile suits built by the
same engineers who

93
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:38,904
made the Gundams. Their test
pilots were Heero Yuy
and Trowa Barton.

94
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,530
What?

95
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,978
[DOROTHY] They've been
reconstructed into mobile dolls
with the combat data

96
00:09:44,978 --> 00:09:49,060
of a Gundam pilot installed
right in the systems.

Even Heero's?

98
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:56,220
A Gundam pilot versus a program
doll. I wonder which of them
will end up winning?

99
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:59,111
Heero won't lose.

100
00:10:01,288 --> 00:10:06,000
Right. He's just so
strong isn't he?

I've got some work to
take care of.

one of the Gundam pilots?

Yes sir we've found our target.

force is almost there.

[DOROTHY] Are you
attacking Peacemillion?

Yes Ms. Dorothy.

112
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:03,150
It's no use. You just can't
defeat the Gundams with
mobile dolls.

113
00:11:03,150 --> 00:11:08,150
We won't know until we try. I'm
sure that we'll defeat them.

114

It's very important that we do
so for the sake of our future.

OK fine. Then go right ahead.

I just hope we don't waste a
valuable military force
before the big battle.

117

Continue as planned!

118
00:11:25,955 --> 00:11:30,170
I see. So you know one of the
Gundam pilots too.

119
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:34,950
Yes but I'm not nearly as strong
as they are. And I can't
fight with them.

But I'm sure there's something I
can do to help them.

You seem strong enough to me. I
on the other hand probably can't

122
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:45,950
do anything at all to
help them out.

123
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:50,970
Anyway it's too dangerous to
stay here. You'd better
make your getaway.

124
00:11:50,970 --> 00:11:55,970
Right. I will go. I really have
to deliver this data I
got on Libra.

You wanna see that Gundam pilot
that you know don't you?

I can't. I have to stay. There's
still some things I have
to take care off.

for Peacemillion.

Send out the Virgos and go
after it at once!

send out the Mercurius

would attract the Gundams here.

here. How about clamming up?

00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:09,645
An excellent play.

150
00:14:09,645 --> 00:14:15,318
Offense is the best defense. If
you're only defensive you
limit yourself.

151
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:20,395
Thanks a lot for the good tip Wu
Fei. Heero wanna play?

152
00:14:24,888 --> 00:14:26,623
[DUO] Huh? [QUATRE] Huh?

153
00:14:26,970 --> 00:14:30,000
What's the matter Heero?

154
00:14:30,978 --> 00:14:34,000
Is something bothering you?

155
00:14:34,045 --> 00:14:35,600
[ALARM]

156
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:37,600
Guess they've beaten us
to the punch.

157
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,845
[QUATRE] Let's go! [DUO] Right!

158
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:43,378
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

159
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:59,060
[HEERO] Enemy mobile dolls.
Virgo troops confirmed.
Proceeding with mission.

160
00:14:59,066 --> 00:15:03,245
The engine's just been fixed so
don't go and wreck it.

161
00:15:03,245 --> 00:15:05,240
I understand.

162
00:15:12,623 --> 00:15:15,023
[WU FEI YELLS]

163
00:15:20,311 --> 00:15:23,150
They are coming in
from the right.

164
00:15:23,150 --> 00:15:25,955
[WU FEI] I'll get 'em. [TROWA]
OK I'll back you up.

165
00:15:25,955 --> 00:15:27,066
Good luck.

166
00:15:28,223 --> 00:15:32,623
[SOLDIER] The Peacemillion
assault force has entered
combat with the Gundams.

167
00:15:32,623 --> 00:15:36,840
[QUINZE] And what about the
Mercurius &amp; Vayeate?
Where are they?

168
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,910
[SOLDIER] They've almost got the
target within firing range.

169
00:15:39,910 --> 00:15:44,910
Alright! We have to shoot down
the Taurus cruiser
before it reaches

170
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:47,910
the Gundam.

171
00:15:49,911 --> 00:15:51,600
[EXPLOSION]

172
00:15:51,823 --> 00:15:53,866
Ah! Ugh...

173
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:00,480
[HILDE] Only a bit further to
go. There's no way I'll let
you defeat me now!

174
00:16:03,150 --> 00:16:05,823
It's those suits!

175
00:16:07,955 --> 00:16:10,800
[HILDE SCREAMS]

176
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,511
There's just no end to them.

177
00:16:17,823 --> 00:16:21,288
[HILDE] Peacemillion!
Peacemillion do you read me?!

178
00:16:21,423 --> 00:16:24,220
Hey... that sounds like...

179
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:27,950
[HILDE] Please answer me...
Duo... Ugh!

180
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,280
Hilde!

181
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,200
[QUATRE] Duo go find her! [DUO]
And leave you guys?!

182
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,755
Hurry! We will take care of
everything here.

183
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:39,245
[DUO] Alright. Thanks!

184
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:41,200
[GUNFIRE]

185
00:16:43,066 --> 00:16:45,778
Ugh. Watch! I'l make it!

186
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:52,223
Ugh! [GROANS]

187
00:16:55,023 --> 00:17:00,750
Hey! It's not over yet. I'll get
this data to Duo and the others.

188
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:06,000
Just watch me. I'm
not going down!

189
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,800
[TARGETING BEEP]

190
00:17:17,023 --> 00:17:18,933
Ah!!

191
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:28,488
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

192
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:36,623
Hilde... you still alive?

193
00:17:36,623 --> 00:17:40,170
Yeah... somehow or other.

194
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:44,178
[DUO] Stay back. I'll take
care of these guys.

195
00:17:44,178 --> 00:17:46,755
Duo! Be careful!!

196
00:17:55,911 --> 00:17:57,200
What?

197
00:18:01,823 --> 00:18:02,930
[DUO] Ugh!

198
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:08,400
What in the heck's going on?
They're way too strong to be
just mobile dolls.

199
00:18:08,445 --> 00:18:09,730
[HILDE] Duo!

200
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:12,930
Those... those mobile
dolls aren't normal.

201
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:17,110
They are programmed with data
taken from you Gundam pilots.

202
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:18,930
Are you sure?

203
00:18:21,423 --> 00:18:23,645
[DRAMATIC MUSIC]

204
00:18:26,711 --> 00:18:29,555
Heero... and Trowa...

205
00:18:29,778 --> 00:18:31,911
[GUNFIRE]

206
00:18:33,866 --> 00:18:39,487
You've gotta be kidding me. So
this is like fighting the two of
them at once isn't it?

207
00:18:42,666 --> 00:18:44,000
Ugh...

208
00:18:47,423 --> 00:18:49,911
Even so...

209
00:18:50,623 --> 00:18:54,088
... they're pretty good copies!

210
00:18:59,155 --> 00:19:03,240
But they're still
just dolls to me.

211
00:19:05,423 --> 00:19:11,378
You don't seriously expect a
Gundam pilot to lose to dolls?!

212
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:21,023
[DUO] You've met your match!!

213
00:19:25,245 --> 00:19:30,400
Next time you'd be better off
programming in MY data.

214
00:19:33,823 --> 00:19:39,466
[DUO] Hilde. Hey Hilde say
something! Hey!

215
00:19:39,466 --> 00:19:41,460
Hilde...

216
00:19:42,845 --> 00:19:50,310
Du‐Duo... I'm glad... you're
safe huh... Duo.

217
00:19:50,310 --> 00:19:56,291
Yeah but you're in terrible
shape. What did you come all the
way out here for Hilde?

218
00:20:00,355 --> 00:20:03,600
[GROANS]

219
00:20:04,266 --> 00:20:10,530
I brought you guys this data on
Libra. Please use it.

220
00:20:12,488 --> 00:20:18,040
But... how come? Why'd you
risk your life?

221
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:23,023
Because I just... I wanted to,
Duo.

222
00:20:25,423 --> 00:20:31,150
Geez... YOU'RE A STUPID FOOL!!

223
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:36,445
I figured you'd say
something like that.

224
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:51,820
[SOLDIER] The Peacemillion
assault troops have been
completely wiped out.

225
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:56,880
Oh that's such a shame. Funny
it's exactly what I
predicted would

226
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:02,880
happen to all of them. Well
maybe there's some
conciliation in the fact we at

227
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:08,880
least got to see the Gundams
fighting so hard. [LAUGHTER]

228
00:21:20,943 --> 00:21:23,977
We can't let the data that she
brought us be put to waste.

229
00:21:25,110 --> 00:21:27,245
No...

230
00:21:28,755 --> 00:21:31,155
[DUO] Heero...

231
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:35,555
Relena Peacecraft is on Libra...

232
00:21:35,555 --> 00:21:37,680
[HEERO] She is?

233
00:21:37,680 --> 00:21:42,845
[DUO] Yeah. Hilde says
she met her there.

234
00:21:46,711 --> 00:21:51,423

[ENDING THEME]

239
00:23:40,301 --> 00:23:44,901
[NARRATOR] Heero sneaks onto
Libra and goes with
Relena to see Zechs.

240
00:23:44,901 --> 00:23:49,942
Treize leads a force of
thousands of armored mobile
suits. Treize desires one

241
00:23:49,942 --> 00:23:55,742
chivalrous duel to settle the
battle. But as Milliardo,
commander of the White Fang,

242
00:23:55,742 --> 00:23:58,559
Zechs refuses
Treize's challenge.

243
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:04,614
Next on Gundam Wing episode 46:
Milliardo's Decision.
