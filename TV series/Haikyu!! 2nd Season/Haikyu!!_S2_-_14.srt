1
00:00:03,529 --> 00:00:06,297
[Kei's Mom]:
So uh... how long can
you stay, sweetie?

2
00:00:06,397 --> 00:00:08,567
I go back to Sendai
in two days...

3
00:00:08,667 --> 00:00:10,936
I have to start back
at work on the 14th.

4
00:00:11,036 --> 00:00:12,303
Oh, are you sure
you're okay

5
00:00:12,403 --> 00:00:13,805
with missing
your brother's game?

6
00:00:13,905 --> 00:00:15,607
Well, when I said I
was gonna try to make it,

7
00:00:15,707 --> 00:00:17,776
he got this irritated
look on his face.

8
00:00:17,876 --> 00:00:19,611
(chuckle)

9
00:00:19,711 --> 00:00:20,946
Oh, that's right...

10
00:00:21,046 --> 00:00:23,348
Hey, Mom, about
his glasses, I‐

11
00:00:23,448 --> 00:00:25,050
[Kei]:
I'm home.

12
00:00:26,217 --> 00:00:28,687
Welcome back...
How did the game go?

13
00:00:28,787 --> 00:00:30,656
Well... we won, so...

14
00:00:30,756 --> 00:00:32,290
Oh! Against who?

15
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,325
[Kei]:
Six‐seven.

16
00:00:34,425 --> 00:00:36,995
[Kei]:
They had a first‐year
who was six foot seven.

17
00:00:37,095 --> 00:00:40,265
Six seven? And you
guys really beat 'em?

18
00:00:40,365 --> 00:00:43,401
But I think he was pretty
new to volleyball though.

19
00:00:43,502 --> 00:00:45,036
Oh yeah?

20
00:00:45,136 --> 00:00:47,238
[Kei]:
But still, in the
blocking department,

21
00:00:47,338 --> 00:00:48,940
I was no match for him.

22
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:50,842
Uh...

23
00:00:52,477 --> 00:00:53,779
What?

24
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:56,615
So uh... you were expecting
to lose today, weren't you?

25
00:00:56,715 --> 00:00:58,249
Well... Yeah...

26
00:00:58,349 --> 00:01:00,652
I mean, the guy
was a beast.

27
00:01:02,621 --> 00:01:03,922
Tell you what.

28
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:07,258
My team's got practice today...
You should come along.

29
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:46,725
[Keishin]:
Free practice from
here on out, guys!

30
00:02:46,825 --> 00:02:48,994
We have less than two months
until the tournament

31
00:02:49,094 --> 00:02:50,996
that's gonna
decide everything!

32
00:02:51,096 --> 00:02:52,363
I want you all
to stay focused

33
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,999
on improving
yourselves, alright?

34
00:02:54,099 --> 00:02:55,466
Yeah!

35
00:02:59,771 --> 00:03:00,872
(gasps)

36
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,240
Uhh...

37
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:05,176
[Hitoka]:
Kageyama?! What
are you doing?!

38
00:03:05,276 --> 00:03:06,578
How did you know
it was me?!

39
00:03:06,678 --> 00:03:07,212
Well...

40
00:03:07,312 --> 00:03:08,814
Dammit!

41
00:03:08,914 --> 00:03:11,750
W‐were you trying to disguise
yourself or something?

42
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:16,755
Um... sorry...

43
00:03:16,855 --> 00:03:19,090
Of all the possible teams
we might end up facing

44
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:23,494
in the tournament, there's one
that I really need to see play.

45
00:03:23,595 --> 00:03:26,297
I get it! You're gonna
record a video!

46
00:03:26,397 --> 00:03:28,333
No. There's an
unspoken rule

47
00:03:28,433 --> 00:03:31,537
that you can only
tape official matches.

48
00:03:31,637 --> 00:03:34,673
I just... I just wanna go
and watch for a little bit.

49
00:03:34,773 --> 00:03:37,175
I don't have a lot of time.
There's less than two months

50
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:38,810
until we start playing again.

51
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:42,681
[Tobio]:
But I need to see them...
I need to study their game!

52
00:03:42,781 --> 00:03:44,049
You know...

53
00:03:44,149 --> 00:03:46,552
...if you're trying to blend
in when you go to a school

54
00:03:46,652 --> 00:03:49,187
after classes are out, don't
you think it's a better idea

55
00:03:49,287 --> 00:03:51,857
to dress like you're
on a sports team there?

56
00:04:03,669 --> 00:04:04,469
Totally.

57
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:06,371
You are just so funny!

58
00:04:06,471 --> 00:04:08,206
[Tobio]:
I go to this school...
I go to this school...

59
00:04:08,306 --> 00:04:10,308
I go to this school...

60
00:04:13,044 --> 00:04:16,381
Just be normal... Be normal...

61
00:04:19,718 --> 00:04:22,420
[Toru]:
Get ready, everyone;
we'll be starting soon.

62
00:04:22,521 --> 00:04:24,489
Next time, we'll swap
out the players.

63
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:25,824
[Team Seijoh]:
Yessir!

64
00:04:36,968 --> 00:04:40,906
Hey. Do you think you'll be
able to out‐play Ushiwaka?

65
00:04:43,008 --> 00:04:44,442
Of course not...

66
00:04:44,543 --> 00:04:46,578
He's like one of the top three
aces in the whole nation...

67
00:04:46,678 --> 00:04:48,346
It would take a
freakin' miracle.

68
00:04:48,446 --> 00:04:49,781
Well one of us has to,

69
00:04:49,881 --> 00:04:51,683
or we won't be able
to beat Shiratorizawa!

70
00:04:51,783 --> 00:04:53,852
[Shoyo]:
I mean, we're the
middle‐blockers!

71
00:04:53,952 --> 00:04:56,487
So you're already worried
about the top team, huh?

72
00:04:56,588 --> 00:04:59,024
Somebody's
pretty confident.

73
00:04:59,124 --> 00:05:00,491
[Shoyo]:
They're the best...

74
00:05:00,592 --> 00:05:02,694
And to be the best you
have to beat the best...

75
00:05:02,794 --> 00:05:05,564
That's how
it works.

76
00:05:05,664 --> 00:05:07,098
Just get out of
my face, please.

77
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:08,567
Oh come on man!

78
00:05:08,667 --> 00:05:13,805
Well if you can't do it...
I'll do it myself!

79
00:05:13,905 --> 00:05:16,608
[Kei]:
Me saying I can't
is one thing.

80
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:20,746
But when somebody else tells
me that... I don't like it.

81
00:05:20,846 --> 00:05:21,312
Huh?

82
00:05:21,412 --> 00:05:23,114
Plus it's you.

83
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:26,585
Oh, God, my stomach! You hit
right in the pressure point

84
00:05:26,685 --> 00:05:28,219
that gives
me diarrhea!

85
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:29,588
See ya.

86
00:05:31,523 --> 00:05:34,492
Hello? It's me.

87
00:05:34,593 --> 00:05:36,427
I'll be there.

88
00:05:42,568 --> 00:05:43,935
[Kazuhito]:
Sorry!

89
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:48,640
So, you survived!
How did it go?

90
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:50,542
[Tobio]:
Well uh...

91
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:55,514
I may never be
able to beat Oikawa...

92
00:05:55,614 --> 00:05:57,583
What does that mean?!
Don't say that!

93
00:05:57,683 --> 00:05:59,785
[Shoyo]:
What did you see?!

94
00:05:59,885 --> 00:06:02,153
Seijoh was having
a practice match...

95
00:06:02,253 --> 00:06:03,622
they were up against
a college team

96
00:06:03,722 --> 00:06:06,257
where some of their
alumni play.

97
00:06:06,357 --> 00:06:09,094
[Tobio]:
When I got there, they
were taking a quick break.

98
00:06:09,194 --> 00:06:12,631
Then they switched out members
and started a new game.

99
00:06:12,731 --> 00:06:16,267
[Toru]:
I'm Oikawa. It's nice
to meet you all.

100
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:19,505
[Tobio]:
Oikawa joined the team
of all college students...

101
00:06:19,605 --> 00:06:21,740
he went in as their setter.

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:24,109
It looked like he was
just meeting most of them

103
00:06:24,209 --> 00:06:25,677
for the first time.

104
00:06:25,777 --> 00:06:28,179
That guy's Aoba Johsai's
captain, right?

105
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,782
He looks just like
I thought he would.

106
00:06:30,882 --> 00:06:34,886
[Tobio]:
But, in a matter
of a few plays...

107
00:06:34,986 --> 00:06:38,790
Oikawa had completely
blended into the team.

108
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:42,961
I could tell the spikers
were REALLY connecting...

109
00:06:43,061 --> 00:06:46,064
No matter who you are,
or how good you are,

110
00:06:46,164 --> 00:06:48,033
or how hard you try...

111
00:06:48,133 --> 00:06:51,970
...there's no guarantee you can
bring out the best in everyone.

112
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:55,641
But for Oikawa, even if
it's someone who hates him,

113
00:06:55,741 --> 00:06:57,108
or a very quirky player...

114
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:00,779
he would manage them
however he wanted.

115
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:04,916
He had the ENTIRE team
under his control...

116
00:07:05,016 --> 00:07:07,953
[Ushiwaka]:
Regardless of where he is
or who he's playing with...

117
00:07:08,053 --> 00:07:11,623
Oikawa can bring out the best
in his entire team.

118
00:07:14,159 --> 00:07:16,895
So wait a minute are you, like,
actually afraid of matching up

119
00:07:16,995 --> 00:07:19,765
against the amazing Great King
again or something?

120
00:07:19,865 --> 00:07:22,734
Yeah... it
scares me, okay?

121
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:28,874
[Tobio]:
The three years that
Oikawa spent with Seijoh,

122
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:31,510
is PACKED into
their current team.

123
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:34,279
And Nationals is our
one and only chance

124
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:35,614
to go up against them.

125
00:07:35,714 --> 00:07:38,684
But we'll win.
I'll make sure of that!

126
00:07:41,452 --> 00:07:43,822
We'll defeat
the Great King!

127
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,525
Grrr! That's
my line, idiot!

128
00:07:48,293 --> 00:07:50,095
Ah... Iwa,
I've got the chills!

129
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:52,731
If you catch a cold,
I'm totally kicking your ass.

130
00:07:52,831 --> 00:07:55,100
How can you be
so mean to me?!

131
00:07:57,869 --> 00:07:59,204
[Akiteru]:
Double!

132
00:08:00,606 --> 00:08:01,740
[Akaizawa]:
Gotcha!

133
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,941
They are working
adults after all.

134
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,576
The power they have
is so different.

135
00:08:04,676 --> 00:08:06,077
Hey, you're all shaky!
What's your deal?

136
00:08:06,177 --> 00:08:08,647
Not gettin' enough
to eat, little guy?

137
00:08:09,314 --> 00:08:10,816
Can I just go home now...?

138
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:13,785
[Akiteru]:
I'd be careful with all
that big talk, Akaizawa...

139
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:16,487
If you don't watch it, my little
brother's gonna shut you out...

140
00:08:16,588 --> 00:08:18,289
You just wait and see.

141
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:20,425
Well, I'm not going to lose
to some scrawny little

142
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:22,994
four‐eyed punk‐ass
high‐schooler!

143
00:08:25,997 --> 00:08:30,702
He loves getting people worked
up, that's all... Ignore him.

144
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:34,105
Hey. Do you think you be
able to out‐play Ushiwaka?

145
00:08:34,205 --> 00:08:37,108
You were expecting to
lose today, weren't you?

146
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:40,245
You think maybe that's
because you suck at it?

147
00:08:41,547 --> 00:08:43,081
Tch...

148
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:50,822
Um...

149
00:08:53,859 --> 00:08:56,327
How do you uh...
stop a spike...

150
00:08:56,427 --> 00:09:00,866
if the uh... if the other guy's
way taller than you...

151
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:03,635
and way more
powerful than you?

152
00:09:11,577 --> 00:09:13,111
[Yahaba]:
Hey!

153
00:09:13,211 --> 00:09:16,915
So you showed up, huh?
At least greet people properly!

154
00:09:17,015 --> 00:09:20,151
Now, now, Yahaba.
Calm it down, alright?

155
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,753
Oikawa.

156
00:09:21,853 --> 00:09:24,990
It's about time!
I've been waiting for you.

157
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,759
[Toru]:
Welcome back... Mad Dog.

158
00:09:48,847 --> 00:09:51,650
[Yutaro]:
So, who is this
Mad Dog guy anyway?

159
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:54,119
[Yahaba]:
A second‐year named
Kentaro Kyotani.

160
00:09:54,219 --> 00:09:56,922
"Mad Dog" is a nickname
that Oikawa gave him.

161
00:09:57,022 --> 00:09:59,190
I think he was pretty famous
back in middle school,

162
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,458
wasn't he?

163
00:10:00,559 --> 00:10:02,493
Oh yeah... I remember.
That's right.

164
00:10:02,594 --> 00:10:06,031
[Yutaro]:
Thanks to his class, South Third
Middle was really strong.

165
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:08,567
[Yahaba]:
As a player, he has
zero team spirit...

166
00:10:08,667 --> 00:10:12,003
but his actual skill level
is miles above anyone else

167
00:10:12,103 --> 00:10:13,539
in our class.

168
00:10:13,639 --> 00:10:16,575
After joining the team,
he had a chance to play a game

169
00:10:16,675 --> 00:10:17,943
in a practice match.

170
00:10:18,043 --> 00:10:20,245
Unfortunately, he got
into a pissing match

171
00:10:20,345 --> 00:10:21,980
with the third‐years.

172
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:25,684
It wasn't really what he said,
it was all about how he said it.

173
00:10:25,784 --> 00:10:28,186
The set is too far from the net!
It's hard to hit it!

174
00:10:28,286 --> 00:10:31,623
You could have followed that
one up, y'know! Man, you suck!

175
00:10:31,723 --> 00:10:34,292
[Yahaba]:
After that, he had
a hostile relationship

176
00:10:34,392 --> 00:10:37,829
with those third‐years, and in
due time he stopped showing up.

177
00:10:37,929 --> 00:10:41,066
Oh great... damn third‐years
are still around.

178
00:10:41,166 --> 00:10:43,134
[Kentaro]:
I thought they'd have
dropped out after losing

179
00:10:43,234 --> 00:10:46,037
the Inter‐High prelims.
'Cause they suck.

180
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,711
Aww... just as hilarious
as always, Mad Dog!

181
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:55,847
Could you stop
calling me stupid nicknames?

182
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:58,216
[Toru]:
Oh come on, you know
you're glad to be playing

183
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:02,153
on the same team as me.
Just admit it.

184
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,124
Wait... You'll come
to realize it soon enough.

185
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:12,097
[Akira]:
Why is he at his guard
all of a sudden.

186
00:11:19,505 --> 00:11:22,708
[Takeda]:
Well, before the
tournament in October

187
00:11:22,808 --> 00:11:24,175
that decides the
representatives,

188
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:26,277
we'll be able to make a
visit to the Kanto region

189
00:11:26,377 --> 00:11:29,414
for a couple of practice matches
including this current trip.

190
00:11:29,515 --> 00:11:32,918
Let's make it count....
It's a valuable opportunity!

191
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:34,485
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

192
00:11:37,689 --> 00:11:39,390
[Bokuto]:
Hey, Tsukki...!

193
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:44,329
Why don'tcha jump a few blocks
for us, pal? Hey, hey, hey!

194
00:11:44,429 --> 00:11:45,396
Hey.

195
00:11:45,496 --> 00:11:46,397
Woo!

196
00:11:46,497 --> 00:11:47,799
Time for today's
episode of

197
00:11:47,899 --> 00:11:50,268
"Bokuto's Adventures
in Stupidity."

198
00:11:52,671 --> 00:11:55,106
Sure. Be glad to.

199
00:11:56,908 --> 00:11:58,677
You're the one
that asked after all;

200
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:01,079
why would you
be so surprised?

201
00:12:01,179 --> 00:12:04,082
[Kei]:
How do you uh... stop a spike...

202
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:08,419
if the uh... if the other guy's
way taller than you...

203
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,789
and way more powerful than you?

204
00:12:15,326 --> 00:12:17,062
Ahem!

205
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,230
Well, okay! When
it comes to blocking,

206
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,466
what do you think is
the most important thing?

207
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:22,934
Uh... height
I guess?

208
00:12:23,034 --> 00:12:25,170
No, it's
timing, actually.

209
00:12:25,270 --> 00:12:26,772
[Keishin]:
To be perfectly honest,

210
00:12:26,872 --> 00:12:28,574
if at least the palm
of the hand is over the net,

211
00:12:28,674 --> 00:12:31,943
a tiny, little grade‐school kid
could even stop Tanaka's spike.

212
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:34,012
I mean, it's not
all that difficult.

213
00:12:34,112 --> 00:12:36,447
That is, if the
timing is spot‐on.

214
00:12:36,548 --> 00:12:38,984
Of course... things like
how you put your hands out

215
00:12:39,084 --> 00:12:42,187
and reading the trajectory of
spikes are factors as well.

216
00:12:42,287 --> 00:12:45,023
I can tell ya that, but I'm
not actually the right guy

217
00:12:45,123 --> 00:12:46,992
to show you
how to do it.

218
00:12:47,092 --> 00:12:49,695
Lucky for us, there is
someone we know that excels

219
00:12:49,795 --> 00:12:52,363
at being an overwhelming
force on the matter.

220
00:12:52,463 --> 00:12:56,334
[Keishin]:
That, my, friend, would be
Kuroo from Nekoma.

221
00:12:56,434 --> 00:12:57,836
[Kuroo]:
Get some!

222
00:12:58,870 --> 00:13:00,572
[Kei]:
Timing.

223
00:13:00,672 --> 00:13:03,174
[Kei]:
The moment that the
opponent swings down,

224
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:05,944
the block is reaching
its pinnacle.

225
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:10,181
Yeah!

226
00:13:11,282 --> 00:13:13,318
Hey, Tsukki! Nice glasses.

227
00:13:13,418 --> 00:13:16,221
How long are you just gonna
sit there and watch?

228
00:13:16,321 --> 00:13:17,355
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:17,455 --> 00:13:19,157
[Kei]:
Excuse me.

230
00:13:28,099 --> 00:13:31,503
The fast attack's success rate
is still at roughly 70%.

231
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:34,472
Well... This is one thing
they're gonna have to learn

232
00:13:34,573 --> 00:13:36,041
through repetition.

233
00:13:38,409 --> 00:13:39,611
Lev!

234
00:13:39,711 --> 00:13:42,047
I told you, don't hold
your arms like a banzai tree;

235
00:13:42,147 --> 00:13:43,882
they'll get right
through every time!

236
00:13:43,982 --> 00:13:46,652
[Kuroo]:
Your arms should be just far
apart enough to stop the ball!

237
00:13:46,752 --> 00:13:48,820
Hello?! You getting
any of this?!

238
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:50,355
[Haiba]:
Yessir!

239
00:15:14,439 --> 00:15:16,241
[Asahi]:
Up front!

240
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:18,844
[Ryunosuke]:
Got it!

241
00:15:18,944 --> 00:15:19,811
[Daichi]:
Sorry!

242
00:15:19,911 --> 00:15:20,812
Center!

243
00:15:20,912 --> 00:15:22,213
Hinata!

244
00:15:27,018 --> 00:15:28,186
[Yaku]:
Out!

245
00:15:31,089 --> 00:15:32,624
[Shoyo]:
Crap! Sorry, guys!

246
00:15:32,724 --> 00:15:34,960
Well... they're finally
starting to look like a team

247
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:37,529
that shouldn't
be underestimated.

248
00:15:39,364 --> 00:15:40,932
[Shoyo]:
(sneezes)

249
00:15:41,032 --> 00:15:43,101
Even in Tokyo, it's
super cold at night!

250
00:15:43,201 --> 00:15:44,870
That's because your
sweat cooled you down

251
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:46,237
after you got
done playing.

252
00:15:46,337 --> 00:15:48,807
I can't wait
for the real games!

253
00:15:48,907 --> 00:15:50,876
Yeah, okay.

254
00:15:50,976 --> 00:15:52,911
[Kenma]:
You know, I've
been thinking.

255
00:15:53,011 --> 00:15:54,312
About what?

256
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,682
You're kind of an
interesting, player.

257
00:15:56,782 --> 00:16:01,252
I'd like to play a game against
you that's not just practice.

258
00:16:01,352 --> 00:16:06,291
Where if you lose... then it
automatically means game over.

259
00:16:08,093 --> 00:16:09,360
Sounds good.

260
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:12,230
That's way more fun
than practice games!

261
00:16:13,331 --> 00:16:15,066
It's a real
shame, Daichi.

262
00:16:15,166 --> 00:16:16,702
But it looks like
the Dumpster Showdown

263
00:16:16,802 --> 00:16:18,336
is the last
chance for us.

264
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,872
We'll be seeing
you at Tokyo Gym.

265
00:16:20,972 --> 00:16:22,240
Yeah.

266
00:16:23,575 --> 00:16:25,944
[Bokuto]:
Hey, hey, Tsukki!

267
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:29,748
You better make sure you kick
Ushiwaka's ass for me, alright?!

268
00:16:29,848 --> 00:16:31,316
And why is that?

269
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,552
Because, Tsukki, I have an
overwhelming winning streak

270
00:16:33,652 --> 00:16:35,020
against you.

271
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,455
[Bokuto]:
So if you score a
victory over Ushiwaka,

272
00:16:37,556 --> 00:16:39,424
Then that's a victory
against Ushiwaka for me!

273
00:16:39,525 --> 00:16:41,326
Sorry... that
makes no sense.

274
00:16:41,426 --> 00:16:46,164
[Bokuto]:
Then no one could stop me!
Hey! Hey! Hey!

275
00:16:46,264 --> 00:16:48,567
[Kei]:
He makes it sound easy...

276
00:16:51,236 --> 00:16:52,504
Over here!

277
00:16:52,604 --> 00:16:53,905
Akaizawa!

278
00:16:54,005 --> 00:16:55,473
[Kei]:
The receive went out of control,

279
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:57,943
so the attack is no
doubt from the left side.

280
00:16:58,043 --> 00:16:59,978
The set is slightly far
from the net.

281
00:17:00,078 --> 00:17:03,882
And his strongest shot by far
is the cross‐court cutter.

282
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:06,251
Right at the moment where
the opponent swings down,

283
00:17:06,351 --> 00:17:08,820
I bring the completed
form of the block!

284
00:17:18,396 --> 00:17:18,964
Yes!

285
00:17:19,064 --> 00:17:20,632
Okay!

286
00:17:20,732 --> 00:17:23,802
You guys should finish up...
Save your strength for tomorrow.

287
00:17:23,902 --> 00:17:25,270
We're stopping already?

288
00:17:25,370 --> 00:17:27,773
I feel like I was just
getting started though...

289
00:17:27,873 --> 00:17:29,374
They wear me out...

290
00:17:29,474 --> 00:17:31,543
[Hitoka]:
If there's something you
still want to practice...

291
00:17:31,643 --> 00:17:34,045
you can start
with that tomorrow!

292
00:17:34,145 --> 00:17:35,714
That makes sense.

293
00:17:35,814 --> 00:17:37,382
Right!

294
00:17:37,482 --> 00:17:39,618
[Shoyo]:
Hey, let's see who can
pick up the most balls!

295
00:17:39,718 --> 00:17:40,986
[Tobio]:
Heh! You're on!

296
00:17:41,086 --> 00:17:42,087
Nice one, Yachi.

297
00:17:42,187 --> 00:17:43,889
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
(battle cry)

298
00:17:43,989 --> 00:17:45,857
[Daichi]:
Don't forget, we need
to take down the net!

299
00:17:45,957 --> 00:17:47,125
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

300
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:02,140
[Shoyo]:
Well, here we are!

301
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,611
We're back at the
Sendai City Gym!

302
00:18:05,711 --> 00:18:07,846
Time to get our revenge!

303
00:18:15,086 --> 00:18:16,622
HAAAAAAAAAH!

304
00:18:16,722 --> 00:18:19,490
Not fair, you got
a head start!

305
00:18:19,591 --> 00:18:21,727
Those two knuckleheads
only have brain capacity

306
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:24,062
for one thought at a
time, don't they?

307
00:18:24,162 --> 00:18:25,196
Simpletons.

308
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:27,533
[Shoyo]:
AAAAHHHH!

309
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:30,669
Oooh...

310
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:33,338
[Terushima]:
Well, well...

311
00:18:33,438 --> 00:18:34,940
Hello, cutie pie!

312
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:37,843
You forgot to give me
your number the other day!

313
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:40,746
Oh, I love it
when you blush!

314
00:18:43,214 --> 00:18:44,516
Hey!

315
00:18:47,986 --> 00:18:50,789
[Misaki]:
S‐stop that!

316
00:18:50,889 --> 00:18:53,324
I‐I'm really sorry about that!

317
00:18:54,526 --> 00:18:56,394
[Tadashi]:
Oh, look at that.

318
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:58,697
[Kei]:
They're frozen in mid‐air.
That's amazing.

319
00:18:58,797 --> 00:19:00,131
[Terushima]:
Well then...

320
00:19:00,231 --> 00:19:02,801
See ya 'round...
Karasuno.

321
00:19:04,836 --> 00:19:06,204
There ya go.

322
00:19:06,304 --> 00:19:07,673
[Tobio]:
Must be one of
the semifinalists

323
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:09,207
from the Inter‐High
preliminaries.

324
00:19:09,307 --> 00:19:11,810
This goes
without saying...

325
00:19:11,910 --> 00:19:14,312
[Shoyo]:
but they were all
good enough....

326
00:19:14,412 --> 00:19:16,347
To make it this far.

327
00:19:32,531 --> 00:19:35,200
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
But we will defeat them all!

328
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:37,102
They sure are
in high spirits.

329
00:19:37,202 --> 00:19:39,638
Thanks to them,
I can stay calm.

330
00:19:45,110 --> 00:19:48,514
[Shoyo]:
I know for a fact that the
bathroom is a dangerous place,

331
00:19:48,614 --> 00:19:52,918
where you can run into
your darkest adversaries!

332
00:19:53,018 --> 00:19:56,354
Carefully... carefully...!

333
00:19:57,288 --> 00:19:59,424
[Toru]:
Uhh... what are you doing?

334
00:20:03,562 --> 00:20:07,566
Th‐the Great King!
And Seijoh's ace player!

335
00:20:07,666 --> 00:20:10,335
I heard you defeated someone
six and a half feet tall.

336
00:20:10,435 --> 00:20:11,770
Yes! Uh, no!

337
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,004
Which is it?

338
00:20:13,104 --> 00:20:15,006
This squirt is a pain
come game time...

339
00:20:15,106 --> 00:20:16,407
He's rather annoying...

340
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:19,611
Let's just take care
of him right here.

341
00:20:19,711 --> 00:20:21,647
E‐excuse me!

342
00:20:21,747 --> 00:20:22,681
Hey!

343
00:20:27,853 --> 00:20:29,755
Hello, Shoyo Hinata...

344
00:20:31,456 --> 00:20:33,391
...and Oikawa and Iwaizumi.

345
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:35,093
Well looky who
we have here?

346
00:20:35,193 --> 00:20:36,695
Ushiwaka!

347
00:20:36,795 --> 00:20:38,463
For you two, it's
the last tournament

348
00:20:38,564 --> 00:20:40,031
of your high
school career.

349
00:20:40,131 --> 00:20:41,166
I wish you
the best of luck.

350
00:20:41,266 --> 00:20:43,134
I'm... getting
pissed off.

351
00:20:43,234 --> 00:20:44,603
We're going to go
to the nationals,

352
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:47,405
so this won't be
the last time.

353
00:20:47,506 --> 00:20:50,709
Yeah, well only one team
can go to the nationals.

354
00:20:50,809 --> 00:20:52,978
The fact that he's
not trying to be mean...

355
00:20:53,078 --> 00:20:54,713
...Makes it even
more annoying!

356
00:20:54,813 --> 00:20:56,515
[Onlooker 1]:
Holy crap, look.

357
00:20:56,615 --> 00:20:58,984
[Onlooker 2]:
Dude! It's Shiratorizawa
and Seijoh...

358
00:20:59,084 --> 00:21:01,386
It's like a freakin'
powder keg ready to explode!

359
00:21:01,486 --> 00:21:03,288
[Onlooker 3]:
Uh... who's the squirt
in the middle?

360
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:05,724
[Onlooker 1]:
And it's him! The little
Number 10 from Karasuno!

361
00:21:05,824 --> 00:21:08,059
The team that defeated that
giant six‐and‐a‐half‐foot tall

362
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,595
guy the other day!

363
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:11,229
[Onlooker 2]:
Is he picking a fight?!
What an idiot!

364
00:21:11,329 --> 00:21:13,899
Uh‐Karasuno will be
the one winning...!

365
00:21:19,104 --> 00:21:20,506
I‐I'm sorry!

366
00:21:23,341 --> 00:21:26,444
Whoever we play...
I won't lose.

367
00:21:35,253 --> 00:21:37,122
Ah! Um‐Thank you!

368
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:39,658
[Date Tech Crowd]:
Go, go, let's go,
let's go, Date Tech!
[Seijoh Crowd]:

369
00:21:39,758 --> 00:21:42,393
[Shiratorizawa Crowd]:
Shiiiiiratorizawa!
Shiiiiiratorizawa!
Go, go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

370
00:21:42,493 --> 00:21:45,697
Go, go, go‐go‐go‐go SeiJOH!

371
00:21:45,797 --> 00:21:48,900
Shiiiiiratorizawa!
Shiiiiiratorizawa!

372
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:52,871
Go! Go! Date Tech!
Date Tech! Here we go!

373
00:21:52,971 --> 00:21:56,141
[Daichi]:
The first match is
Seijoh in court B,

374
00:21:56,241 --> 00:21:58,777
and Shiratorizawa in court A.

375
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:01,847
(whistle blows)

376
00:22:01,947 --> 00:22:04,783
[Daichi]:
We're up next! Get ready!

377
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:06,585
Yeah!

378
00:22:09,254 --> 00:22:11,790
[Terushima]:
Everyone's here
to do their best.

379
00:22:11,890 --> 00:22:14,259
But their best
won't be better than us!

380
00:22:14,359 --> 00:22:17,996
[Team Johzenji]
(cheering)

381
00:22:18,096 --> 00:22:22,801
[Black‐haired Spectator]:
That's that super
energetic team... Johzenji!

382
00:23:55,961 --> 00:23:58,396
[Ryunosuke]:
Better keep our eye on that
smooth‐talker from Johzenji!

383
00:23:58,496 --> 00:24:01,266
[Yu]:
If that's the case, we're gonna
be on guard 'round the clock!

384
00:24:01,366 --> 00:24:03,935
[Ryunosuke]:
Even if it kills us, we will
make sure to protect Kiyoko!

385
00:24:04,035 --> 00:24:06,972
[Asahi]:
You guys are makin' asses
of yourselves, again...

386
00:24:07,072 --> 00:24:09,908
[Asahi]:
Next Haikyu!! "Playground."
