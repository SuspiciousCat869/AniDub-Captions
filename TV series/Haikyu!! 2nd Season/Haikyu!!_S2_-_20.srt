1
00:00:01,637 --> 00:00:06,808
(audience cheering)

2
00:00:06,908 --> 00:00:08,677
You guys ready
to do this?!

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:09,911
Yessir!

4
00:00:10,011 --> 00:00:10,679
Aw yeah!

5
00:00:10,779 --> 00:00:13,014
Yeah!

6
00:00:13,114 --> 00:00:16,017
Karasuno's energy is a bit
different today.

7
00:00:16,117 --> 00:00:17,586
[Koshi]:
Little help!

8
00:00:17,686 --> 00:00:19,320
Oh.

9
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,662
Hello Kageyama.

10
00:00:26,762 --> 00:00:30,365
If it isn't the mopey little
mop‐head I destroyed last time.

11
00:00:30,465 --> 00:00:32,968
Oh yeah well it'll be
different this time.

12
00:00:33,068 --> 00:00:34,435
So tell me
how did it feel

13
00:00:34,536 --> 00:00:36,505
to get knocked down to your
knees where you belong?

14
00:00:36,605 --> 00:00:38,907
The only person worthy
of playing me, is Ushiwaka!

15
00:00:39,007 --> 00:00:41,610
You should do the honorable
thing and stand aside

16
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,915
for the real contest! I'm sure
you can get tickets to watch!

17
00:00:47,015 --> 00:00:49,818
Seriously? Is this guy really
a third‐year in high school?

18
00:00:49,918 --> 00:00:53,655
That Oikawa sure can be
full of himself, can't he?

19
00:00:58,860 --> 00:01:00,562
Hey, you know what?

20
00:01:00,662 --> 00:01:03,599
[Yahaba]:
Karasuno has another girl
manager over there.

21
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:05,000
And she's a cutie, too.

22
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:06,668
Here y'go.

23
00:01:06,768 --> 00:01:11,306
Yeah I know, right? And it's
making me kinda angry inside.

24
00:01:12,107 --> 00:01:13,474
Check this out.

25
00:01:15,176 --> 00:01:17,979
Yoo‐hoo!

26
00:01:18,079 --> 00:01:21,149
Could you uh... help me out?

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:22,984
Crap!

28
00:01:23,084 --> 00:01:24,252
[Yutaro]:
Look out!

29
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:33,161
So hot...

30
00:01:33,261 --> 00:01:34,730
You dropped your ball.

31
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,798
Yeah, thanks.

32
00:01:36,898 --> 00:01:38,266
Well that didn't work.

33
00:01:38,366 --> 00:01:40,468
The Karasuno guys
have her on lock‐down.

34
00:01:40,569 --> 00:01:43,605
Yahaba uhh... you're
really shallow, y'know?

35
00:01:43,705 --> 00:01:46,875
Whatever, it's time for
us to get warmed up, okay?

36
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:57,619
Um, are you
all right, man?

37
00:01:59,821 --> 00:02:00,989
Kageyama.

38
00:02:01,089 --> 00:02:02,624
Huh?

39
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:04,359
[Shoyo]:
Was that guy
always on their team?

40
00:02:04,459 --> 00:02:07,328
[Tobio]:
I'm... not sure.

41
00:03:41,990 --> 00:03:43,725
Alright, Captains.

42
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,528
Let's have
a good game.

43
00:03:46,628 --> 00:03:48,830
So I take it you've
fully recovered?

44
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:50,331
Yeah. Thank you.

45
00:03:50,431 --> 00:03:52,100
In fact I think the rest
has given me more energy.

46
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,435
You think so, huh?

47
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,471
There's something
about you, Daichi.

48
00:03:56,572 --> 00:03:58,740
It's like you're more
dignified these days.

49
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,677
I've grown these
last four months.

50
00:04:01,777 --> 00:04:05,480
So, another penalty, huh?
You guys must like those.

51
00:04:05,581 --> 00:04:08,717
Hey, hey, hey!
You on a break right now?

52
00:04:08,817 --> 00:04:10,586
Then how about
we practice together!

53
00:04:10,686 --> 00:04:12,287
You know, a
little one‐on‐one?

54
00:04:12,387 --> 00:04:15,356
I've been inspired by a rather
odd bunch of new friends.

55
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,526
I have no idea what you're
talking about, but good luck.

56
00:04:17,626 --> 00:04:21,496
Tails will be Aoba‐Johsai;
and heads will be Karasuno.

57
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,134
[Referee]:
Heads, it is.

58
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:29,004
We choose...
to receive.

59
00:04:29,104 --> 00:04:30,972
Thank you, we'll serve.

60
00:04:32,473 --> 00:04:34,442
[Daichi]:
Line up!

61
00:04:52,861 --> 00:04:57,365
Kageyama... we are
going to win.

62
00:04:59,968 --> 00:05:01,503
Yeah.

63
00:05:02,871 --> 00:05:05,607
[Team Karasuno/Team Seijoh]:
Let's have a good game!

64
00:05:08,043 --> 00:05:10,779
[Takinoue]:
Well now! Looks like
I made it in time!

65
00:05:10,879 --> 00:05:13,649
Hey. You missed the
WakuNan game this morning,

66
00:05:13,749 --> 00:05:15,250
it was quite
the deathmatch.

67
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:18,353
Oh man, I wish I could
have seen that!

68
00:05:18,453 --> 00:05:21,990
Hey there. I'm Saeko Tanaka,
Ryu's big sister.

69
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:23,191
Is that right?!

70
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,561
His sister, huh?
I guess I can see it.

71
00:05:25,661 --> 00:05:28,263
I can't believe they made it
to the semifinals.

72
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:29,731
Yeah.

73
00:05:29,831 --> 00:05:32,267
Wait this is the semifinals?
So... then that means...

74
00:05:32,367 --> 00:05:34,936
[Saeko]:
if they win this one and the
next one, they're going on

75
00:05:35,036 --> 00:05:36,805
to Nationals?!
That's incredible!

76
00:05:36,905 --> 00:05:38,640
[Shimada]:
Well, they'll
have to defeat

77
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:41,409
two extremely tough
schools to do it.

78
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:44,379
[Irihata]:
Gentlemen, this is the third
time our squad has gone

79
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:45,781
against Karasuno this year.

80
00:05:45,881 --> 00:05:47,683
And each time we've
gone against them,

81
00:05:47,783 --> 00:05:50,485
Karasuno has managed
to surprise us.

82
00:05:50,586 --> 00:05:53,989
This match, too, will have it's
share of twists and turns.

83
00:05:54,089 --> 00:05:56,091
But if you stay calm
and do what you do,

84
00:05:56,191 --> 00:05:58,459
victory will be yours
in the end...

85
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,662
Now go and fight with
everything you've got.

86
00:06:00,762 --> 00:06:01,863
[Team Seijoh]:
Yessir!

87
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,899
I hate to admit it,
but Karasuno's

88
00:06:03,999 --> 00:06:05,667
a very tough opponent.

89
00:06:05,767 --> 00:06:08,604
Wow, it's not like you to
compliment the opposing team.

90
00:06:08,704 --> 00:06:11,873
I'm fine and I'm taking
our last match to heart.

91
00:06:11,973 --> 00:06:13,875
If we let our
guard down, we're done.

92
00:06:13,975 --> 00:06:16,444
So we must attack them
from the very start.

93
00:06:16,545 --> 00:06:18,647
[Team Seijoh]:
Yeah! All right!

94
00:06:18,747 --> 00:06:22,851
Okiedoke then, guys, are we
ready to do this or what?

95
00:06:24,185 --> 00:06:25,120
You guys‐

96
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,888
We trust you... Captain!

97
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:35,864
Well I trust you guys...

98
00:06:35,964 --> 00:06:37,633
Make your first serve
a good one, okay?

99
00:06:37,733 --> 00:06:40,168
If you screw it up, you
owe us ramen after the game.

100
00:06:40,268 --> 00:06:42,804
I'll take mine with
extra slices of roasted pork.

101
00:06:42,904 --> 00:06:44,840
I'll add a side
of potstickers to that.

102
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,576
[Issei]:
And you can't just land one
on their side of the court.

103
00:06:47,676 --> 00:06:49,978
So you first and
second‐years wanna order?

104
00:06:50,078 --> 00:06:51,713
[First and Second‐years]:
Seriously?!

105
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:56,184
[Takeda]:
The crow's broken wings
are now healed.

106
00:06:56,284 --> 00:06:59,955
And it has come back strong.
Stronger than ever before.

107
00:07:00,055 --> 00:07:02,423
You have trained long
and hard for this day.

108
00:07:02,524 --> 00:07:04,192
And now it's time to
take all you've learned

109
00:07:04,292 --> 00:07:08,530
and put it to work. It's time
to fly. And soar into the skies.

110
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,331
As long as you do
what needs to be done...

111
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:14,169
True results will follow.
I know you can do it, guys.

112
00:07:14,269 --> 00:07:15,937
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

113
00:07:16,037 --> 00:07:17,639
All yours, Coach.

114
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,541
Okay to put
it bluntly...

115
00:07:19,641 --> 00:07:23,444
[Keishin]:
Seijoh is a really
bad matchup for you guys.

116
00:07:23,545 --> 00:07:25,614
I mean they're poised
and they adapt...

117
00:07:25,714 --> 00:07:28,550
That's just not something
you respond well to.

118
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:31,653
Sack up... you'll
have to overcome it.

119
00:07:35,924 --> 00:07:38,827
Be more than what they
expect you to be!

120
00:07:38,927 --> 00:07:40,228
(cheering)

121
00:07:58,947 --> 00:08:01,750
Let's go, go, go,
go, Seijoh! Go!

122
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,219
Let's go, go, go, go, Seijoh!

123
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:07,022
Go, Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐Seijoh!

124
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:14,129
[Yutaro]:
Go for it Oikawa!

125
00:08:14,229 --> 00:08:17,799
[Takinoue]:
Woo... we have to start
the game against Oikawa serving?

126
00:08:17,899 --> 00:08:19,601
Is he really that good?

127
00:08:19,701 --> 00:08:21,169
Yeah is he?

128
00:08:21,269 --> 00:08:22,604
His arm's like a cannon.

129
00:08:22,704 --> 00:08:25,173
They can start the game off
with a lot of momentum

130
00:08:25,273 --> 00:08:26,975
with a really good serve.

131
00:08:27,075 --> 00:08:29,645
[Takinoue]:
And to be honest.
That's exactly what he does.

132
00:08:29,745 --> 00:08:31,346
Let's go!

133
00:08:31,446 --> 00:08:32,380
Soy sauce!

134
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:33,348
Pork bone!

135
00:08:33,448 --> 00:08:34,816
Szechuan style!

136
00:08:34,916 --> 00:08:36,251
Huh?

137
00:08:36,351 --> 00:08:39,588
I can't tell if you guys want
me to land this thing or not!

138
00:08:41,657 --> 00:08:43,391
Unfortunately, we know
what you'll do.

139
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:46,895
[Hanamaki]:
You'll crush the ball,
and our dinner plans.

140
00:08:49,565 --> 00:08:54,002
[Crowd]:
OooooooolÃ©!

141
00:08:55,904 --> 00:08:58,674
[Takinoue]:
Woo, they got it! Nice!

142
00:09:00,075 --> 00:09:01,342
Hell yes!

143
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,745
If I touched that,
my arms would fall off...

144
00:09:03,845 --> 00:09:05,814
[Shimada]:
Wait... it's not
over the net yet!

145
00:09:05,914 --> 00:09:08,183
[Takinoue]:
Seijoh's gonna get to it!

146
00:09:10,251 --> 00:09:14,656
[Yutaro]:
Kageyama got the first touch,
so there won't be a fast attack!

147
00:09:14,756 --> 00:09:16,758
That should simplify things.

148
00:09:35,811 --> 00:09:38,780
Why are the guys who did it
the most surprised of all?!

149
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,382
[Daichi]:
Nice, guys! Well done!

150
00:09:41,482 --> 00:09:42,851
[Yu/Asahi]:
Thanks!

151
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:47,155
All right, it's on!
Karasuno is reborn!

152
00:09:52,728 --> 00:09:54,663
[Chikara]:
Alright. Do it, Kageyama!

153
00:09:54,763 --> 00:09:56,397
[Tadashi]:
You got this!

154
00:10:02,804 --> 00:10:04,405
[Toru]:
Makki!

155
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,274
That's got a good line!

156
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,781
[Daichi]:
It's okay, shake it off!

157
00:10:12,881 --> 00:10:15,183
[Ryunosuke]:
You almost got it. Next time!

158
00:10:16,117 --> 00:10:18,253
[Yutaro]:
Give it to 'em, Iwa!

159
00:10:19,821 --> 00:10:21,156
If I remember correctly,

160
00:10:21,256 --> 00:10:24,025
this guy's serves have
gotten a lot stronger.

161
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,500
Damn, that went long!
I'm sorry, Kageyama!

162
00:10:32,601 --> 00:10:37,438
These guys really can serve,
can't they! That is just insane!

163
00:10:37,539 --> 00:10:39,040
[Hajime]:
Slam it, Kunimi!

164
00:10:42,778 --> 00:10:46,748
YEEEAAAAAH!

165
00:10:46,848 --> 00:10:48,717
OHHHHHH! Man I cannot
believe he just did that!

166
00:10:48,817 --> 00:10:52,888
Heey! That's my brooo!
Kick their assesss!

167
00:10:52,988 --> 00:10:56,291
Whoa, h‐hey Saeko,
take it down a notch!

168
00:10:56,391 --> 00:10:59,828
I want to touch the ball,
too, you guys...!

169
00:11:04,032 --> 00:11:05,834
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

170
00:11:05,934 --> 00:11:08,436
Hey, man, Seijoh and Karasuno
are off to a good start.

171
00:11:08,537 --> 00:11:10,238
Oh, yeah? Let's see.

172
00:11:10,338 --> 00:11:11,907
Alright, nice receive!

173
00:11:12,007 --> 00:11:13,909
Let's go guys, kill it!

174
00:11:15,944 --> 00:11:17,412
Nice one, Mattsun!

175
00:11:17,513 --> 00:11:18,847
Over here!

176
00:11:22,684 --> 00:11:24,820
Yeahhh!

177
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:26,755
Aggggh! My bad!

178
00:11:26,855 --> 00:11:29,424
That was me,
the set was too low!

179
00:11:30,792 --> 00:11:33,061
[Daichi]:
You got this, Tsukishima!

180
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:36,998
Whoooa... These guys are going
toe‐to‐toe from the get go!

181
00:11:37,098 --> 00:11:38,667
Yeah, well, that may be true...

182
00:11:38,767 --> 00:11:41,002
[Shimada]:
but I think it's
about time for Hinata

183
00:11:41,102 --> 00:11:43,038
to drop one of
his quick‐attacks.

184
00:11:43,138 --> 00:11:45,240
[Takinoue]:
I hear that.
[Saeko]:
What do you mean?

185
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:48,076
[Takinoue]:
Well, in the previous match
against Seijoh...

186
00:11:48,176 --> 00:11:50,345
Hinata's quick‐attack was set
up with perfect timing,

187
00:11:50,445 --> 00:11:54,550
But it got completely stuffed,
And the game was over.

188
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:57,719
It's got to be lingering in
everyone's minds out there.

189
00:11:57,819 --> 00:12:01,022
[Takinoue]:
And for Hinata and Kageyama,
they could use something

190
00:12:01,122 --> 00:12:03,324
positive like that to move on.

191
00:12:07,428 --> 00:12:08,496
Iwa!

192
00:12:10,966 --> 00:12:13,068
[Ryunosuke]:
Good get, Daichi!

193
00:12:13,168 --> 00:12:14,469
All right...

194
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:25,614
Aw yeah!
He got under it!

195
00:12:25,714 --> 00:12:28,850
[Hajime]:
It's coming back over!
Get back, get back!

196
00:12:28,950 --> 00:12:30,586
[Hanamaki]:
Cover! Cover!

197
00:12:30,686 --> 00:12:33,889
[Tobio]:
He's got himself so worked up,
he didn't see the blockers!

198
00:12:34,756 --> 00:12:36,858
Dammit, I'll get
the next one...!

199
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,897
Calm your ass down...
Don't... be... a moron!

200
00:12:41,997 --> 00:12:43,732
[Kei]:
Who needs to
calm down?

201
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,266
[Ryunosuke]:
Take a chill pill,
my dudes.

202
00:12:45,366 --> 00:12:47,869
Okay Iwaizumi,
it's all you!

203
00:12:47,969 --> 00:12:51,807
Dammit, Kageyama,
my butt really hurts!

204
00:12:53,074 --> 00:12:54,342
Nice one‐touch!

205
00:12:54,442 --> 00:12:55,476
Now one more time!

206
00:12:55,577 --> 00:12:57,145
I got it!

207
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:03,519
One more time!

208
00:13:03,619 --> 00:13:04,485
Do it!

209
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:06,588
Do it!

210
00:13:06,688 --> 00:13:09,224
Avenge that final shot...

211
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:24,540
[Team Karasuno]:
Smash it to pieces!

212
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:39,120
Now that that's done...

213
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:43,358
YEAAAAAAAH!
[Koshi]:
...we can get this game started!

214
00:13:58,106 --> 00:14:01,342
YEAAAAAAAH!

215
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:03,512
Dude, that Number 10
is amazing!

216
00:14:03,612 --> 00:14:06,314
Looks like Karasuno's strong
this year after all.

217
00:14:06,414 --> 00:14:09,450
(cheering)

218
00:14:09,551 --> 00:14:11,052
Good going, Hinata!

219
00:14:11,152 --> 00:14:14,322
That was great! Now we have
something to build on!

220
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,357
Why'd you kick me,
you stupid piece of crap?!

221
00:14:16,457 --> 00:14:19,027
I was just trying to
straighten you up, moron!

222
00:14:19,127 --> 00:14:20,028
What'd you say?!

223
00:14:20,128 --> 00:14:21,396
Hey take it easy.

224
00:14:21,496 --> 00:14:23,398
I guess they've picked
themselves up.

225
00:14:23,498 --> 00:14:25,967
Well, it was all thanks
to my expertly sage advice.

226
00:14:26,067 --> 00:14:29,538
If they get that combo going,
then we could have a problem.

227
00:14:29,638 --> 00:14:31,172
Yeah, you're right about that.

228
00:14:31,272 --> 00:14:33,909
So let's just take our time and
see what their game tells us.

229
00:14:34,009 --> 00:14:35,476
[Team Seijoh]:
Right!

230
00:14:35,577 --> 00:14:37,078
[Spectator 1]:
We're only in the first set,

231
00:14:37,178 --> 00:14:38,980
and this game is already
turning out to be epic.

232
00:14:39,080 --> 00:14:42,718
[Spectator 2]:
Right? I didn't think Karasuno
would even get this far.

233
00:14:42,818 --> 00:14:45,521
I mean, I figured their
performance last time

234
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:47,122
was just a fluke.

235
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:54,530
[Ryunosuke]:
Great dig, Daichi!

236
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:59,100
[Tobio]:
Are they planning
to handle Hinata's spikes

237
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:01,302
with just receives again?

238
00:15:10,546 --> 00:15:12,280
I guess Number 10 really
is starting to hit

239
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:14,149
the ball at
different angles.

240
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,918
Just shake
it off, man!

241
00:15:17,018 --> 00:15:19,588
[Daichi]:
Alright, Kageyama, nail it!

242
00:15:21,222 --> 00:15:22,791
[Watari]:
Sorry! Cover it!

243
00:15:22,891 --> 00:15:24,125
This is all you Makki!

244
00:15:24,225 --> 00:15:26,294
I got it! Kunimi!

245
00:15:26,394 --> 00:15:27,395
Right!

246
00:15:30,298 --> 00:15:32,968
Yeah! Niiice kill!

247
00:15:33,068 --> 00:15:34,603
That was a
really good ball.

248
00:15:34,703 --> 00:15:37,238
Agh, they just switched setters
like with was nothing...

249
00:15:37,338 --> 00:15:38,874
Dammit, I hate these guys!

250
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,308
Seijoh's at
it again.

251
00:15:40,408 --> 00:15:43,011
Their adaptability is
really something to see.

252
00:15:43,111 --> 00:15:45,614
Their gears mesh
together so effortlessly.

253
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,716
Yeah. Pisses me off.

254
00:15:49,818 --> 00:15:50,819
Ah...! Sorry!

255
00:15:50,919 --> 00:15:52,353
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

256
00:15:54,956 --> 00:15:57,559
[Team Seijoh]
(cheering)

257
00:15:59,394 --> 00:16:02,030
Hey. Listen to me
for a second.

258
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,666
Heads up, guys!
Come on, buddy.

259
00:16:04,766 --> 00:16:07,669
I know exactly where you
wanna go with this.

260
00:16:10,205 --> 00:16:11,640
Got it! That's right!

261
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:14,510
The spot where the back‐row
setter moves up from!

262
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:16,011
Nice receive, Tanaka!

263
00:16:16,111 --> 00:16:17,613
All right,
he got it up clean!

264
00:16:17,713 --> 00:16:20,682
Hinata, it's time for another
one of your broad shots!

265
00:16:24,786 --> 00:16:26,655
They're adding a blocker?!

266
00:16:26,755 --> 00:16:30,526
[Keishin]:
It's not easy to stop it
with just one guy... but...

267
00:16:32,027 --> 00:16:34,362
You don't wanna hit
it this way do ya?

268
00:16:34,462 --> 00:16:37,298
I mean you not gonna
hit here, right?

269
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,870
Yes! A line shot,
just like we wanted!

270
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:44,806
I think we can ignore their
cross‐court seam shots,

271
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:46,307
and wait for the liners.

272
00:16:46,407 --> 00:16:48,577
They forced him to narrow
down his options!

273
00:16:48,677 --> 00:16:50,411
[Koshi]:
Counterattack!

274
00:16:53,515 --> 00:16:55,216
This is a lot of pressure!

275
00:16:55,316 --> 00:16:58,286
Those third‐years of
there's are really scary!

276
00:16:58,386 --> 00:17:00,121
Looks like if we
narrow the lanes,

277
00:17:00,221 --> 00:17:01,356
we can pick up the receives.

278
00:17:01,456 --> 00:17:03,091
I'll give it a try
myself next time.

279
00:17:03,191 --> 00:17:05,827
Well aren't you
clever, Mattsun.

280
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,328
They already
figured out a way

281
00:17:07,428 --> 00:17:10,165
to counter Hinata's
broad strikes.

282
00:17:10,265 --> 00:17:12,534
I'd expect nothing
less from them.

283
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:13,735
Yeah.

284
00:17:13,835 --> 00:17:15,170
Each and every Seijoh
player on the court

285
00:17:15,270 --> 00:17:16,838
is thinking
while they play.

286
00:17:16,938 --> 00:17:20,075
It's the true source of what
makes them such a strong unit.

287
00:17:20,175 --> 00:17:21,810
[Keishin]:
However...

288
00:17:23,178 --> 00:17:24,980
[Hajime]:
Nice receive!

289
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,017
Sugawara said... When it comes
to Seijoh's quick‐attacks,

290
00:17:29,117 --> 00:17:31,587
I need to time it
later than usual...

291
00:17:32,721 --> 00:17:34,222
and then jump!

292
00:17:39,227 --> 00:17:41,196
That one's
right back at you!

293
00:17:41,296 --> 00:17:43,799
Don't get cocky after
one measly point!

294
00:17:43,899 --> 00:17:46,568
All right...
They're making sure

295
00:17:46,668 --> 00:17:48,970
to use what they
learned last time!

296
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:51,607
Karasuno's ability
to respond is improving.

297
00:17:51,707 --> 00:17:54,342
We're one step short
of getting things going.

298
00:17:56,211 --> 00:17:57,679
[Hanamaki]:
Nice receive!

299
00:18:00,982 --> 00:18:04,219
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Way to go, Kidaichi!
Keep it up, Kidaichi!

300
00:18:04,319 --> 00:18:07,155
Let's go, get another point!

301
00:18:07,255 --> 00:18:09,625
Uh‐oh... now he's
coming up again.

302
00:18:09,725 --> 00:18:13,228
[Hitoka]:
Oh... the guy with
the arm‐ripping serve.

303
00:18:13,328 --> 00:18:15,496
[Hajime]:
Nail it, Oikawa!

304
00:18:24,105 --> 00:18:26,708
Um... You might want to watch
the back of your head.

305
00:18:26,808 --> 00:18:28,276
Wait, what?

306
00:18:31,346 --> 00:18:33,348
Come on!
Bring it on!

307
00:18:52,901 --> 00:18:56,037
Agggghh! Sorryyyyyy!

308
00:18:56,137 --> 00:18:58,807
That was good!
Nice and aggressive!

309
00:18:58,907 --> 00:19:00,375
You'll get
the next one.

310
00:19:00,475 --> 00:19:03,945
Yeah we'll take that!
Let's keep it going!

311
00:19:04,045 --> 00:19:05,213
What the hell was that?!

312
00:19:05,313 --> 00:19:07,448
That was ALMOST as
hard as a spike!

313
00:19:07,549 --> 00:19:10,819
Was it a fluke that
it was THAT powerful?!

314
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:14,856
[Daichi]:
No, it wasn't a fluke.
That's not how he works...

315
00:19:14,956 --> 00:19:16,658
So if it was on purpose.

316
00:19:16,758 --> 00:19:19,094
Did he actually increase
his power even if it

317
00:19:19,194 --> 00:19:21,029
posed a considerable
amount of risk?

318
00:19:21,129 --> 00:19:24,232
Oh I want to try receiving
a serve like that!

319
00:19:24,332 --> 00:19:25,867
Send another one!

320
00:19:27,235 --> 00:19:29,137
D'you hear the sound it made?

321
00:19:29,237 --> 00:19:31,372
My arms would be
totally obliterated.

322
00:19:31,472 --> 00:19:34,375
You know I don't think
I could even get that.

323
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,211
Seems like that thing
was hitting the wall

324
00:19:36,311 --> 00:19:39,781
before I even really
saw it. Good grief.

325
00:19:39,881 --> 00:19:42,718
All right! Let's go guys
it's set point!

326
00:19:42,818 --> 00:19:46,421
Just keep at it!
We can take this, guys!

327
00:19:48,089 --> 00:19:49,558
Thank you.

328
00:19:55,831 --> 00:19:57,766
I don't think I
can match his serve.

329
00:19:57,866 --> 00:20:00,769
There's no use straining myself
trying to compete against him.

330
00:20:00,869 --> 00:20:03,471
Our team is stronger
as a group of six

331
00:20:03,572 --> 00:20:05,206
than any individual player.

332
00:20:05,306 --> 00:20:07,208
I don't believe it,
Karasuno's seriously

333
00:20:07,308 --> 00:20:08,877
gonna take
the first set?!

334
00:20:08,977 --> 00:20:11,279
Seijoh has to come up
with some counter attacks

335
00:20:11,379 --> 00:20:12,981
or they're gonna be
in some serious trouble.

336
00:20:13,081 --> 00:20:15,951
We can still take this set!
Just keep your composure!

337
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:17,519
[Team Seijoh]:
Yessir!

338
00:20:19,187 --> 00:20:20,922
And this is no time
to play afraid.

339
00:20:21,022 --> 00:20:23,825
We must confront the
challenge in front of us.

340
00:20:31,399 --> 00:20:33,702
[Issei]:
Yeah, nice rip!

341
00:20:33,802 --> 00:20:36,638
If Seijoh can get one more point
then they can force the deuce.

342
00:20:36,738 --> 00:20:39,140
They have to get
this break to do it.

343
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,676
Just calm down you guys.

344
00:20:40,776 --> 00:20:43,078
Control the ball
and get this point!

345
00:20:43,178 --> 00:20:44,379
[Team Karasuno]:
Right!

346
00:20:44,479 --> 00:20:46,915
We can take the
first set from Seijoh!

347
00:20:47,015 --> 00:20:47,916
We can do it.

348
00:20:48,016 --> 00:20:50,218
Concentrate and focus!

349
00:20:50,318 --> 00:20:52,420
Maaan, points like
this are always

350
00:20:52,521 --> 00:20:53,889
so nerve‐wracking
aren't they?

351
00:20:53,989 --> 00:20:55,390
You're damn right.

352
00:20:55,490 --> 00:20:57,258
And I would say Seijoh
has the most pressure.

353
00:20:57,358 --> 00:20:59,661
(whistle blows)

354
00:20:59,761 --> 00:21:03,031
[Shimada]:
Seijoh is... making
a substitution.?

355
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,968
This is where the game changes.

356
00:21:11,206 --> 00:21:12,641
It's that guy
from earlier.

357
00:21:12,741 --> 00:21:13,909
Yeah.

358
00:21:14,009 --> 00:21:15,744
I don't think we've ever
seen this guy before.

359
00:21:15,844 --> 00:21:17,212
Right.

360
00:21:17,312 --> 00:21:19,447
[Takeda]:
He's not even a pinch
server or anything.

361
00:21:19,548 --> 00:21:22,083
And what a strange
time for a substitution:

362
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:23,985
right when we're at set point...

363
00:21:24,085 --> 00:21:25,887
They might be trying to
strengthen the block

364
00:21:25,987 --> 00:21:29,324
on the left. Careful not to
telegraph your spikes.

365
00:21:29,424 --> 00:21:30,792
Yessir.

366
00:21:34,195 --> 00:21:35,831
[Yutaro]:
Send it, Iwa!

367
00:21:39,935 --> 00:21:41,202
Sorry, that was short!

368
00:21:41,302 --> 00:21:42,738
Yours Tanaka!

369
00:21:43,471 --> 00:21:44,305
[Yutaro]:
One‐touch!

370
00:21:44,405 --> 00:21:46,474
Chance ball, got it!

371
00:21:46,575 --> 00:21:48,443
I'm under it!

372
00:21:49,077 --> 00:21:50,679
Kindaichi.

373
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:15,003
[Takeda]:
The gears meshing together
far too cleanly...

374
00:22:15,103 --> 00:22:17,272
can fall apart on their own.

375
00:22:17,372 --> 00:22:18,907
And suddenly...

376
00:22:19,007 --> 00:22:23,712
everything you thought you knew,
is now a complete mystery.

377
00:23:55,336 --> 00:23:58,540
[Shoyo]:
That spike from that Number 16
was like "WHOOSH!" and "BLAM!"

378
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:01,510
[Ryunosuke]:
Yeah well I don't like the look
in his beady little eyes.

379
00:24:01,610 --> 00:24:03,812
Or his stupid,
tennis ball haircut.

380
00:24:03,912 --> 00:24:06,615
[Koshi]:
Tanaka, all of that can be
said for yourself y'know...

381
00:24:06,715 --> 00:24:09,851
