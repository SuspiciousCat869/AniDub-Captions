1
00:00:01,622 --> 00:00:04,391
(drills/practice)

2
00:00:05,125 --> 00:00:06,360
[TADASHI]
Huh?

3
00:00:08,763 --> 00:00:09,864
(TADASHI cowers)

4
00:00:09,964 --> 00:00:11,966
[ASAMUSHI]
Hey man, Nice kill up there!

5
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,367
(HITOKA terrified)
[MINAMIDA] Well done!

6
00:00:13,467 --> 00:00:16,070
[STUDENT A]
Man, did you see the angle!

7
00:00:17,004 --> 00:00:18,005
[KAKUGAWA]
Nice kill!

8
00:00:18,105 --> 00:00:19,206
(long whistle)

9
00:00:19,306 --> 00:00:22,376
[EVERYONE]
Thank you for the game!

10
00:00:22,476 --> 00:00:24,912
(CROWD cheering)
[HITOKA] I got a look at him up
close, he was so intense.

11
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:29,483
[KAKUGAWA GM]
Well you look like you're
in pretty good form today
Hyakuzawa. I think we got this.

12
00:00:29,584 --> 00:00:33,754
[HYAKUZAWA] Uh yessir.
[MINAMIDA] And look I don't see
anyone out there anywhere near
your size.

13
00:00:33,854 --> 00:00:36,724
[MINAMIDA] You should tear
these guys apart.
[HYAKUZAWA] Yeah okay.

14
00:00:36,824 --> 00:00:39,426
[NURUKAWA]
If there's any rules you don't
understand, feel free to ask.

15
00:00:39,527 --> 00:00:41,696
[HYAKUZAWA]
I think I'm getting
them figured out now.

16
00:00:41,796 --> 00:00:44,765
[KOMAKI]
About No.3 and No.9. You've
already seen how they serve.

17
00:00:44,865 --> 00:00:47,401
So then... Let's get
'em up in the air.

18
00:00:47,502 --> 00:00:53,073
[KOMAKI]
Now yes it's true that these
guys gave Seijoh a hard time...
but that's nothing to us.

19
00:00:53,173 --> 00:00:56,877
[KOMAKI]
We just need to remember our
strengths and take our game to
them.

20
00:00:56,977 --> 00:00:57,945
[KOMAKI]
Now let's go!

21
00:00:58,045 --> 00:00:59,714
[KAKUGAWA]
Yessir!

22
00:01:01,516 --> 00:01:02,416
[SHOYO]
Oh?

23
00:01:05,953 --> 00:01:09,857
[DAICHI, internal]
This may only be the
preliminaries, but we need
this win to move forward.

24
00:01:09,957 --> 00:01:13,427
[RYUNOSUKE, internal]
Even if we're up against someone
6'7" or whatever...

25
00:01:14,494 --> 00:01:17,064
[KURASUNO, internal]
We're definitely gonna win!

26
00:02:51,659 --> 00:02:52,593
(whistle)

27
00:02:52,693 --> 00:02:54,895
[KOSHI]
Make it a good
one, Tsukishima!

28
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:57,031
[MINAMIDA]
Musshi!

29
00:02:57,131 --> 00:02:59,567
[ASAMUSHI] I got it!
[KOMAKI] Hyakuzawa!

30
00:02:59,667 --> 00:03:02,002
[OHNO]
Gonna start by challenging
them with a straight ball!

31
00:03:02,102 --> 00:03:05,940
[UKAI]
They're wanting to start off on
a good note with a shot from
their ace.

32
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:08,643
[MINAMIDA]
It's a triple block!

33
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:11,512
[MINAMIDA]
Well. Not that it really
matters or anything.

34
00:03:14,348 --> 00:03:16,517
[SHOYO, TOBIO, & RYUNOSUKE]
(internal) Oh crap?

35
00:03:17,752 --> 00:03:20,054
(CROWD cheers)
(KAKUGAWA celebrates)

36
00:03:20,154 --> 00:03:22,923
[KOSHI] Oh man, that shot was
completely above the block...
[MINAMIDA] Nice kill, Hyakuzawa!

37
00:03:23,023 --> 00:03:24,959
(HITOKA worried)
[STUDENT A] D'you freakin'
see that?

38
00:03:25,059 --> 00:03:28,095
[STUDENT B]
What's the point in even
trying to block that?

39
00:03:28,195 --> 00:03:29,363
[DAICHI]
Coming in from the left!

40
00:03:29,463 --> 00:03:30,765
[KOMAKI]
Hyakuzawa!

41
00:03:32,366 --> 00:03:33,568
[YU]
Sorry, cover!

42
00:03:33,668 --> 00:03:36,403
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hinata, go for the last shot!

43
00:03:37,505 --> 00:03:39,874
[SHOYO]
If I spike this, I'll get
blocked...!

44
00:03:41,542 --> 00:03:42,910
[KOMAKI, internal]
(gasp) It's a lob!

45
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:52,987
(whistle)
(KAKUGAWA celebrates)
(HITOKA concerned)

46
00:03:53,087 --> 00:03:55,089
[TAKEDA]
That guy's really stinkin' tall.

47
00:03:55,189 --> 00:03:59,059
Well normally... that last shot
would have gone over the block
no problem.

48
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:03,230
[MINAMIDA] Get ready
for another one!
[HYAKUZAWA] Alright.
[KEISHIN] But this

49
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:05,866
[SHOYO] I'm really sorry! I
think that last ball might have
been a bit low.
[KOMAKI]

50
00:04:05,966 --> 00:04:08,135
[ASAHI] Shake it off.
You're fine!
[KOMAKI]
just follow the ball.

51
00:04:08,235 --> 00:04:09,904
[RYUNOSUKE] Next one, next one!
[DAICHI] All right, let's get
one back.
[KOMAKI]

52
00:04:10,004 --> 00:04:12,773
[HYAKUZAWA] Alright.
[SHOYO] Okay!
(HITOKA surprised)

53
00:04:12,873 --> 00:04:15,309
[HITOKA, internal] More and
more people keep showing up.
[STUDENT C] See, that's the
guy who's 6'7".

54
00:04:15,409 --> 00:04:17,177
[STUDENT D]
Man, you weren't kidding.

55
00:04:17,277 --> 00:04:19,146
[MIKAKO]
Wow, he's a monster!

56
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:20,748
[OHNO]
Hmm? Oh, hello there Mikako.

57
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:23,651
[MIKAKO]
Oh uh! Hey there how
are you doing Ohno?!

58
00:04:23,751 --> 00:04:25,786
[OHNO]
Hey Coach, this is my neighbor.

59
00:04:25,886 --> 00:04:28,523
Mikako here is the counselor
for our middle school
volleyball team.

60
00:04:28,623 --> 00:04:33,427
[MIKAKO]
Hi. I can't believe how
tall he is. That blocker
is really intimidating.

61
00:04:33,528 --> 00:04:35,530
[MIKAKO]
All the players on my team
are pretty small.

62
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:39,734
[MIKAKO]
So I can't help but sympathize
with the Kurasuno boys. It's
gotta be tough.

63
00:04:39,834 --> 00:04:42,202
[OHNO]
Un‐uh‐uh..... Don't
worry about them.

64
00:04:42,302 --> 00:04:46,040
[OHNO]
Take a look at little number
ten, he won't even pay that big
guy any mind!

65
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:47,508
Isn't that right, Coach?

66
00:04:47,608 --> 00:04:49,777
[UKAI]
It's true he's at a
disadvantage.

67
00:04:50,778 --> 00:04:54,281
In both his height
and his power...

68
00:04:54,381 --> 00:04:57,084
[UKAI]
In basic terms, pure
strength and size

69
00:04:57,184 --> 00:04:58,686
can be a formidable obstacle

70
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,488
[UKAI]
something that keeps ordinary
people at bay.

71
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:06,260
At least that's true...
if you fight them head‐on.

72
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:08,395
(TOBIO sigh)

73
00:05:08,495 --> 00:05:13,233
[SHOYO]
Hm? Why are you wriggling your
fingers around like some crazy
old wizard, dude.

74
00:05:13,333 --> 00:05:14,268
(TOBIO questioning)

75
00:05:14,368 --> 00:05:15,703
(SHOYO alarmed)

76
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:18,072
[TOBIO]
Well...

77
00:05:18,172 --> 00:05:19,707
I'm feeling something.

78
00:05:19,807 --> 00:05:23,443
The ball seems to fit my
hands even more perfectly than
usual...

79
00:05:26,681 --> 00:05:28,215
[MINAMIDA]
It's up! Above the net!

80
00:05:28,315 --> 00:05:29,850
[DAICHI]
Push it over, Hinata!

81
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,553
[KOMAKI, internal]
Go ahead. In a shoving match
above the net,

82
00:05:32,653 --> 00:05:35,489
it's impossible for
Hyakuzawa to lose.

83
00:05:36,757 --> 00:05:38,358
(SHOYO shock)

84
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,761
(CROWD cheering)
(OHNO & MIKAKO shocked)

85
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:41,862
(whistle)

86
00:05:42,797 --> 00:05:44,732
[YU]
Let it go!

87
00:05:44,832 --> 00:05:47,334
[STUDENT E] There. Karasuno
finally got a point.
(KURASUNO celebrates)

88
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,003
[STUDENT F]
Only because of an unforced
error.

89
00:05:49,103 --> 00:05:51,371
[STUDENT E]
I'd never heard
of Kakugawa before,

90
00:05:51,471 --> 00:05:53,273
but now that's all people
are talking about.

91
00:05:53,373 --> 00:05:56,410
[STUDENT F]
That's what happens when you
have a guy 6'7" on the floor.

92
00:05:56,511 --> 00:05:58,746
[STUDENT E]
A real one‐man show, huh?
(ASAMUSHI annoyed)

93
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:00,548
[STUDENTS, internal]
Oh man! I think he heard us?!

94
00:06:00,648 --> 00:06:03,083
[ASAMUSHI]
Nobody here gives the
rest of us respect.

95
00:06:03,183 --> 00:06:04,819
[MINAMIDA]
Oh whatever who cares.

96
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,922
[ASAMUSHI] Wha‐?
[MINAMIDA] Stay focused.
Number nine's serving.

97
00:06:08,022 --> 00:06:10,758
[MINAMIDA] Let's shove it right
back down their throats!
[YU] Give it to 'em, Kageyama!

98
00:06:10,858 --> 00:06:11,992
(whistle)

99
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:18,332
(CHIKARA & HISASHI surprised)
[KOSHI] He mis‐hit it!

100
00:06:18,432 --> 00:06:19,499
[ASAMUSHI]
I got it!

101
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,804
(KAKUGAWA making call‐outs)

102
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:29,109
(whistle) (KAKUGAWA cheers)

103
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:33,247
[DAICHI, internal] There's no
way... we'll reach a ball that
high. Although...
[KOMAKI] Nice kill, Hyakuzawa!

104
00:06:33,347 --> 00:06:35,516
[CHANTS]
Let's go Kakugawa!

105
00:06:35,616 --> 00:06:37,518
[KEISHIN]
(surprised) Do it, Specs.

106
00:06:37,618 --> 00:06:39,153
[TAKEDA]
Uh? Right.

107
00:06:39,253 --> 00:06:41,088
(long whistle)

108
00:06:41,188 --> 00:06:42,723
[STUDENT A]
A time out, huh...

109
00:06:42,823 --> 00:06:45,359
[STUDENT B]
Karasuno doesn't know what
to do about that guy.

110
00:06:45,459 --> 00:06:47,895
(CROWD cheers)
[HITOKA, internal]
(frustrated) No. That's not
true. It can't be!

111
00:06:47,995 --> 00:06:49,930
[INAGAKI]
Looking really good out there!

112
00:06:50,030 --> 00:06:53,167
Not too bad for someone
playing in their very first
official match, huh?

113
00:06:53,267 --> 00:06:54,735
[HYAKUZAWA]
Okay, thanks.

114
00:06:54,835 --> 00:06:57,137
[MINAMIDA] Don't let
it bug you okay.
[ASAMUSHI] Hm? Huh?

115
00:06:57,237 --> 00:07:00,975
[MINAMIDA]
Listen, just like how all the
other teams have their ace, well
we have Hyakuzawa.

116
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:05,746
[MINAMIDA]
And the more we help him be
successful, the better it'll
be for all of us.

117
00:07:05,846 --> 00:07:08,182
[MINAMIDA]
Even if he's the only one
in the spotlight.

118
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:13,554
[MINAMIDA]
So. All we have to do is make it
look like it's no accident
Hyakuzawa's on the team.

119
00:07:13,654 --> 00:07:16,490
[KOMAKI]
That's right. Our job is to put
everything we have

120
00:07:16,591 --> 00:07:18,959
into capitalizing on
Hyakuzawa's raw power.

121
00:07:19,059 --> 00:07:24,231
[KOMAKI]
They can call us what they
want... But this is how we play.
It's how we win.

122
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,766
(ASAMUSHI & MINAMIDA agreeing)

123
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:28,102
[INAGAKI]
What's wrong?

124
00:07:28,202 --> 00:07:29,870
[HYAKUZAWA]
That No.10...

125
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:32,439
He's so short and he's jumping
around so desperately,

126
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,074
I kinda feel sorry for him.

127
00:07:34,174 --> 00:07:37,044
[INAGAKI] What, are
you kidding me, man?
[HYAKUZAWA] Uh... no.

128
00:07:37,144 --> 00:07:40,515
[ASAMUSHI]
I understand.
He doesn't stand a chance.

129
00:07:40,615 --> 00:07:44,451
Even though his opponent across
the net has only been playing
for six months or so.

130
00:07:44,552 --> 00:07:47,688
[ASAMUSHI]
That's a bitter pill to swallow.

131
00:07:47,788 --> 00:07:50,157
I know that passing and
technique can be hard...

132
00:07:50,257 --> 00:07:52,459
But seriously.

133
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,461
[HYAKUZAWA]
The game's pretty simple.

134
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:56,731
[SHOYO]
No matter how high I jump,

135
00:07:56,831 --> 00:07:57,998
it gets hit from above me.

136
00:07:58,098 --> 00:07:59,166
What am I supposed to do?

137
00:07:59,266 --> 00:08:00,901
[DAICHI]
First off, calm down.

138
00:08:01,001 --> 00:08:05,873
[YU]
Hinata... There' a lot more to
volleyball than just air combat.

139
00:08:05,973 --> 00:08:07,241
(SHOYO confused)

140
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,609
[DAICHI]
Bring it in.

141
00:08:08,709 --> 00:08:10,711
I've noticed a little something.

142
00:08:11,211 --> 00:08:13,180
(long whistle)

143
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,749
[MINAMIDA]
Left, left!

144
00:08:17,117 --> 00:08:19,787
[KOMAKI] Hyakuzawa! Yours!
[SHOYO] Here it comes.

145
00:08:19,887 --> 00:08:22,890
[DAICHI]
After watching the previous
game... And warm ups.

146
00:08:22,990 --> 00:08:27,261
[DAICHI]
I don't think No.9 can hit any
shots in multiple directions.

147
00:08:27,361 --> 00:08:32,499
[YU]
He only shoots cross‐court...
in whatever direction his body
is facing.

148
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,368
[KEISHIN]
After watching them practice...

149
00:08:34,468 --> 00:08:37,271
I'm thinking he must have
just started playing
volleyball fairly recently.

150
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:39,674
[SHOYO]
So then he's kinda like
Lev Haiba from Nekoma.

151
00:08:39,774 --> 00:08:43,410
[KEISHIN]
Kinda, but he doesn't
have the speed or the
dexterity that Lev does.

152
00:08:43,511 --> 00:08:46,581
[KEISHIN]
On the other hand, this
Kaiju kid is still tall and

153
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:49,617
powerful enough to overwhelm
others with what he does know.

154
00:08:49,717 --> 00:08:52,753
[DAICHI]
So, when that No.9 is
striking the ball...,

155
00:08:52,853 --> 00:08:56,624
[DAICHI]
We can disregard the possibility
of any line shots.

156
00:08:57,124 --> 00:08:58,826
[YU]
Yeaaaah!

157
00:09:00,828 --> 00:09:02,362
[OGASAWARA]
He's jumpin' sideways!

158
00:09:02,462 --> 00:09:04,131
[HITOKA] Go guys!
(HYAKUZAWA surprised)

159
00:09:07,702 --> 00:09:09,637
(whistle) (CROWD cheers)
[AYA & OGASAWARA] All right!

160
00:09:09,737 --> 00:09:12,372
(KURASUNO celebrates)
[HITOKA] (amazed) He almost
wasn't able to get it over him.

161
00:09:12,472 --> 00:09:14,308
[OHNO]
Way to go, Karasuno!

162
00:09:14,408 --> 00:09:18,713
Somehow our boys have
figured out how to counter
that big guy's attack!

163
00:09:18,813 --> 00:09:21,716
[UKAI]
Now to figure out how to
land an attack of their own.

164
00:09:21,816 --> 00:09:23,150
[DAICHI]
Crush it Tanaka.

165
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,652
[RYUNOSUKE]
Alright. Got it.

166
00:09:24,752 --> 00:09:25,986
[TOBIO]
Today I...

167
00:09:26,821 --> 00:09:27,855
[TOBIO]
I feel good.

168
00:09:27,955 --> 00:09:29,256
[SHOYO]
Huh?

169
00:09:29,356 --> 00:09:31,091
[TOBIO] Daichi.
[DAICHI] Uh‐huh.

170
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:33,594
[TOBIO]
Hey uh I'm feeling really good
out here right now...

171
00:09:33,694 --> 00:09:35,362
can I try out that
new quick attack?

172
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:38,566
[DAICHI] Uh...
(SHOYO excited panting)

173
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,201
[HITOKA] What the...? He's
looking really weird.
[DAICHI] Calm down, Hinata.

174
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:44,939
[OGASAWARA]
Our dog makes that face
when we show it some food
and it's hungry!

175
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,306
(UKAI chuckle)

176
00:09:46,406 --> 00:09:47,608
(whistle)

177
00:09:49,243 --> 00:09:50,110
[ASAMUSHI]
It's all yours!

178
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,245
[MINAMIDA]
I got it!

179
00:09:51,345 --> 00:09:52,913
[KOMAKI]
Hyakuzawa!

180
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:57,084
[YU]
Aw yeah!

181
00:09:57,184 --> 00:10:00,020
[KOMAKI]
Remember, no matter how many
tricky moves No.10 tries to do,

182
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,123
[KOMAKI]
just follow the ball,
you can always block him
wherever he ends up.

183
00:10:03,223 --> 00:10:05,492
[HYAKUZAWA]
Okay... Just follow the ball...

184
00:10:05,593 --> 00:10:07,061
(HYAKUZAWA shocked)

185
00:10:10,264 --> 00:10:12,132
(ASAMUSHI & INAGAKI shocked)

186
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:14,101
(whistle) (KOMAKI shock)

187
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,836
(CROWD goes wild)

188
00:10:15,936 --> 00:10:18,305
[STUDENT B]
There it is! The super
quick‐attack!

189
00:10:18,405 --> 00:10:21,542
[HITOKA, internal]
It's slightly different from
what they've been doing until
now...

190
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:24,545
(HITOKA laughing)
[OGASAWARA] Yachi, are
you having an episode?

191
00:10:24,645 --> 00:10:30,851
[OHNO] Woo‐hooey!
That short No.10 is amazing!
[UKAI]
Most likely, the tallest player

192
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:37,324
[UKAI]
And the one that makes the
biggest fool of him... may be a
kid that's only five‐foot‐four.

193
00:10:55,375 --> 00:11:00,548
[HYAKUZAWA]
I know that passing and
technique can be hard...
But seriously.

194
00:11:00,648 --> 00:11:02,149
[HYAKUZAWA]
The game's pretty simple.

195
00:11:02,249 --> 00:11:05,553
[HYAKUZAWA, internal]
What the hell is this?! I'm 6'7"

196
00:11:05,653 --> 00:11:08,756
and this kid can't be
more than 5'4"!

197
00:11:08,856 --> 00:11:11,526
[HYAKUZAWA]
How can he possibly
be above me?!

198
00:11:11,626 --> 00:11:13,794
(whistle) (KURASUNO celebrates)
[STUDENT A] It's that fast
attack from No.10 again!

199
00:11:13,894 --> 00:11:15,996
[STUDENT B]
How many has it been now?

200
00:11:16,096 --> 00:11:20,100
[YU & RYUNOSUKE] Oh yeah.
That's right. You know it.
[SHOYO]
AAh!! How'd you like that?! Did

201
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:22,436
[YU] Oh yeah.
[DAICHI] You guys, shut up!
(ALL startled)

202
00:11:22,537 --> 00:11:26,440
[SHOYO, YU, & RYUNOSUKE]
S‐sorry...
[TAKEDA]
If we can start landing fast

203
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:28,042
[KEISHIN]
No, not exactly...

204
00:11:28,142 --> 00:11:31,679
Takeda, you're thinking about
what Karasuno used to be.

205
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:33,113
(whistle)

206
00:11:33,213 --> 00:11:35,883
(SHOYO inhale, exhale)
[DAICHI] You got this Hinata.

207
00:11:35,983 --> 00:11:38,152
[SHOYO, internal]
There he is. Over in the corner.

208
00:11:38,252 --> 00:11:42,456
Sugawara said it was so
nobody would go after
him with their serve.

209
00:11:42,557 --> 00:11:44,825
[SHOYO, internal]
Well, it's not like I can
actually aim my serve anyway!

210
00:11:44,925 --> 00:11:49,096
[CHIKARA]
It's not all that unusual to
see spikers that concentrate
only on attacking.

211
00:11:49,196 --> 00:11:55,035
[CHIKARA]
But in Kakugawa's case, it seems
No.9 is sorta being protected by
the other members of his team.

212
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:59,206
[TAKEDA] When No.9 is in
the back row, I feel a
little better.
[KOMAKI] Nice receive!

213
00:11:59,306 --> 00:12:02,076
[KEISHIN] Don't go letting your
guard down, Specs.
[MINAMIDA] Double block!

214
00:12:02,176 --> 00:12:03,077
[SHOYO]
Hyah!

215
00:12:03,177 --> 00:12:04,979
[TAKEDA]
(startled) Oh my God!

216
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:07,748
[INAGAKI]
It's coming back over! Get under
it for a direct set!

217
00:12:07,848 --> 00:12:10,718
The big fellow only practiced
hitting every ball that goes up
high,

218
00:12:10,818 --> 00:12:15,723
[MINAMIDA] Ready...
Coming your way!
[KEISHIN]
I don't think he spent much time

219
00:12:15,823 --> 00:12:22,997
[KEISHIN]
Which means, whenever No.9 is in
the back row, the aerial combat
is right at the net...

220
00:12:25,199 --> 00:12:27,067
[KEISHIN]
...the advantage is ours!

221
00:12:27,902 --> 00:12:30,137
[MINAMIDA]
No.10! 10!

222
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,510
(whistle) (KURASUNO celebrates)

223
00:12:35,610 --> 00:12:37,077
[TAKEDA]
That makes it set point!

224
00:12:37,177 --> 00:12:39,046
[KEISHIN]
Yeah, here we are.

225
00:12:39,146 --> 00:12:41,882
[HITOKA] Just one more!
[OHNO] C'mon boys don't let up!

226
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:47,087
[OGASAWARA]
Coach Ukai. Is the fast
attack that Shoyo is doing
still First Tempo?

227
00:12:47,187 --> 00:12:50,224
[UKAI]
Do you remember everything
I taught you about tempo?

228
00:12:50,324 --> 00:12:51,258
[OGASAWARA]
Yeah!

229
00:12:55,062 --> 00:12:56,430
[HYAKUZAWA]
Nice receive!

230
00:12:56,531 --> 00:12:58,498
[OGASAWARA]
Whenever the ball goes
up really high,

231
00:12:58,599 --> 00:13:04,972
so the spiker can slowly
make his approach to the
net That's Third Tempo.

232
00:13:07,374 --> 00:13:08,442
(whistle)

233
00:13:08,543 --> 00:13:09,744
(KAKUGAWA celebrates)

234
00:13:09,844 --> 00:13:11,411
[ASAMUSHI]
Nice, Hyakuzawa!

235
00:13:11,512 --> 00:13:14,148
[AYA]
And when the spiker's approach
starts at the same time

236
00:13:14,248 --> 00:13:18,385
the set is going up.
That's Second Tempo.

237
00:13:19,887 --> 00:13:21,989
[ASAMUSHI] All right!
[MINAMIDA] Good one, Musshi!

238
00:13:22,089 --> 00:13:23,991
[OGASAWARA]
When the spiker starts
his approach first

239
00:13:24,091 --> 00:13:28,963
and the set is adjusted to where
he goes. That's First Tempo.

240
00:13:31,566 --> 00:13:34,001
[ASAHI] Nice one, Nishinoya!
[UKAI] To be successful against
the block...

241
00:13:34,101 --> 00:13:37,037
you must make contact at
a higher impact point than
the blocker.

242
00:13:37,137 --> 00:13:43,443
[UKAI]
In this particular case, the
winner is whoever can reach the
pinnacle first.

243
00:13:43,544 --> 00:13:48,415
Now the quick‐attack from the
little fella... I would not
technically call it First Tempo.

244
00:13:48,516 --> 00:13:52,687
[UKAI]
At the moment when the setter
is tossing the ball,

245
00:13:52,787 --> 00:13:56,390
[UKAI]
the spiker's approach and
takeoff have already been
completed.

246
00:14:02,229 --> 00:14:06,300
[UKAI]
It's almost Minus Tempo!

247
00:14:08,769 --> 00:14:10,671
(whistle) (long whistle)

248
00:14:10,771 --> 00:14:12,206
(KURASUNO celebrates)

249
00:14:12,306 --> 00:14:14,441
[AYA & OGASAWARA]
Minus Tempo, Awesome!

250
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:17,211
(CROWD astonished)
[UKAI] Don't you even think
about trying that yourselves,
kids.

251
00:14:17,311 --> 00:14:19,514
[OGASAWARA]
Huh? Why can't we Coach?

252
00:14:19,614 --> 00:14:21,115
[UKAI]
Those two are the only ones

253
00:14:21,215 --> 00:14:24,118
who could pull off an attack
strategy that preposterous.

254
00:14:24,218 --> 00:14:29,356
[SHOYO]
Ahhh... Hey. You know how you
asked before the game if I was
wimping out on you?

255
00:14:29,456 --> 00:14:33,027
[SHOYO]
Was that because you knew that
this fast attack was gonna work?

256
00:14:33,127 --> 00:14:37,765
[TOBIO]
No... I just knew that I was
feeling a little better than
usual today.

257
00:14:37,865 --> 00:14:40,167
[SHOYO]
Then, why would you
say that to me?

258
00:14:40,835 --> 00:14:42,002
[TOBIO]
Well I mean...

259
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:43,738
you put in a lot of
practice didn't you?

260
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:46,774
[TOBIO] Like, on stuff
other than quick‐attacks.
(SHOYO surprised)

261
00:14:46,874 --> 00:14:50,578
[TOBIO]
Well... that very first feint
you did got stuffed pretty
easily.

262
00:14:50,678 --> 00:14:52,012
[SHOYO]
Oh shut your face!

263
00:14:52,112 --> 00:14:54,148
Okay rather than just chasing
number ten around..

264
00:14:54,248 --> 00:14:56,250
let's focus on all
their other attacks.

265
00:14:56,350 --> 00:14:58,519
[MINAMIDA] Sounds good.
[KOMAKI] We know that our
blockers

266
00:14:58,619 --> 00:15:00,154
are having trouble
with that guy,

267
00:15:00,254 --> 00:15:03,257
but the same goes for them
with Hyakuzawa. We can do this.

268
00:15:03,357 --> 00:15:05,726
(exhale through nose) So it's
going to be a slug fest.

269
00:15:05,826 --> 00:15:07,762
(long whistle)

270
00:15:07,862 --> 00:15:08,996
(whistle)

271
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:12,967
[TOBIO] Nice receive!
[MINAMIDA] Here we go,
number ten!

272
00:15:13,734 --> 00:15:14,669
[MINAMIDA]
Cover it!

273
00:15:14,769 --> 00:15:16,303
[KOMAKI]
Hyakuzawa!

274
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:19,339
(whistle)

275
00:15:19,439 --> 00:15:20,708
[HYAKUZAWA]
Yeah!

276
00:15:20,808 --> 00:15:22,042
[YU]
Dammit...

277
00:15:22,142 --> 00:15:23,811
[DAICHI]
Shake it off!
Whatever they score

278
00:15:23,911 --> 00:15:25,913
[DAICHI] on us
we'll get it back!
[YU] Right!

279
00:15:26,013 --> 00:15:28,783
[DAICHI]
That's why we increased
the number of weapons in
our arsenal!

280
00:15:28,883 --> 00:15:33,821
[OGASAWARA]
Coach Ukai. If I have to go up
against someone who's that much
bigger than me...

281
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:37,191
[OGASAWARA]
is using an attack like Shoyo
and Kageyama the only way to
win?

282
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:41,796
[UKAI] (cracks up)
No no, of course not.
[OGASAWARA] Bwah.

283
00:15:41,896 --> 00:15:46,266
[UKAI] If you can't win with
one or two, you simply
increase your numbers!
[TOBIO] Nice one, Noya!

284
00:15:46,366 --> 00:15:49,537
[OGASAWARA]
Oh! Four different players
started moving at once!

285
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:53,107
[UKAI]
A synchronized assault
at First Tempo!

286
00:15:55,409 --> 00:15:57,377
(whistle)
[RYUNOSUKE] Yeahhh!

287
00:15:57,477 --> 00:16:00,147
[DAICHI]
Nice one, Tanaka!
[KOMAKI, internal]
No.10 alone is already

288
00:16:00,247 --> 00:16:02,517
[HYAKUZAWA]
I'll take a point back!
(KOMAKI surprised)

289
00:16:02,617 --> 00:16:06,120
[HYAKUZAWA]
It's what I'm here to do, right!
Just leave it to me guys.

290
00:16:06,654 --> 00:16:07,955
[KOMAKI]
Hm?

291
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:19,600
[KEISHIN]
I don't believe this guy...

292
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,636
[KEISHIN]
He should be pretty
worn out by now,

293
00:16:21,736 --> 00:16:24,438
but he seems to be getting
more and more powerful.

294
00:16:24,539 --> 00:16:26,741
[KOMAKI] Front, front!
[ASAMUSHI] Nice receive!

295
00:16:26,841 --> 00:16:30,077
[HYAKUZAWA, internal]
It may be true that I don't have
very much experience out here...

296
00:16:30,177 --> 00:16:34,582
[KOMAKI] Hyakuzawa!
[HYAKUZAWA, internal]
...But I can still score points!

297
00:16:34,682 --> 00:16:38,619
[RYUNOSUKE] Sorry,
that went big!
[KOMAKI] Hyakuzawa! Do a direct!
[HYAKUZAWA, internal]

298
00:16:38,719 --> 00:16:40,420
[HYAKUZAWA]
And slam it to the ground!
(whistle)

299
00:16:40,521 --> 00:16:42,422
[HYAKUZAWA]
Yeah!!

300
00:16:42,523 --> 00:16:44,291
(SHOYO annoyed)

301
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:48,228
(whistle)
(KURASUNO celebrate)

302
00:16:48,328 --> 00:16:51,398
[KOSHI] Tanaka, nice kill!
[HITOKA] Yes it's match‐point!

303
00:16:51,498 --> 00:16:56,370
[STUDENT E]
Karasuno's rotation right now
has pretty short blockers, maybe
Kakugawa can catch up.

304
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,472
[DAICHI]
I think I just heard some
chatter from the fans

305
00:16:58,573 --> 00:17:01,208
about how short our front
line is right now.

306
00:17:01,308 --> 00:17:03,210
[DAICHI]
Must look small next to a guy
who's six, seven.

307
00:17:03,310 --> 00:17:04,979
[RYUNOSUKE & SHOYO]
(shocked) What was that?!

308
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,214
[STUDENT E] He could hear me?!
[STUDENT F] There's
no freakin' way.

309
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:12,019
[DAICHI]
All right listen you guys...
If we can't block the ball...
receive it.

310
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:13,554
(SHOYO & RYUNOSUKE agreeing nod)

311
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:18,759
[MINAMIDA]
It's up!

312
00:17:18,859 --> 00:17:21,962
[KOMAKI]
Hyakuzawa! It's all you, man!

313
00:17:22,062 --> 00:17:24,364
[DAICHI]
Give it a second! Not quite yet!

314
00:17:24,464 --> 00:17:25,900
[DAICHI]
If a wall isn't going to work...

315
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,468
[DAICHI]
We go with something else!

316
00:17:30,004 --> 00:17:30,871
(HYAKUZAWA shocked)

317
00:17:30,971 --> 00:17:32,673
A soft block, get it!

318
00:17:33,774 --> 00:17:35,342
[RYUNOSUKE]
Asahi, nice!

319
00:17:35,442 --> 00:17:37,077
[ASAHI]
Good one, Tanaka!

320
00:17:38,278 --> 00:17:40,748
[HYAKUZAWA, internal]
If it's not a fast‐attack...

321
00:17:40,848 --> 00:17:43,183
then you're doomed, little man!

322
00:17:48,989 --> 00:17:52,092
[BOKUTO]
Spiking isn't all about slamming
it onto the floor, y'know.

323
00:17:52,192 --> 00:17:54,094
(INAGAKI & MINAMIDA reaching for
the ball) (floor dive)

324
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:56,296
[SHOYO]
...Hyaah!!

325
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:10,110
(whistle) (long whistle)

326
00:18:10,811 --> 00:18:12,980
(KURASUNO & CROWD cheering)

327
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,284
[HITOKA] All right! They won
even without even needing the
black‐belly lantern!
[OHNO] Boo‐yah!

328
00:18:17,384 --> 00:18:24,792
[OGASAWARA] Black‐belly lantern?
[UKAI] Off the partial block?
Was it coincidence, or did he
intentionally do that?

329
00:18:24,892 --> 00:18:28,996
[SHOYO, internal]
I got a point... with something
other than the fast attack!
(surprised)

330
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:31,031
[ASAHI] Yes you did it, Hinata!
[DAICHI] Well done, little man.

331
00:18:31,131 --> 00:18:33,868
[YU] We made it past
the first round, guys!
[RYUNOSUKE] All right!

332
00:18:33,968 --> 00:18:36,070
[HYAKUZAWA] Inagaki.
[INAGAKI] Hmm?

333
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:39,406
[HYAKUZAWA] You know how I said
volleyball was a simple game...
[DAICHI] Hinata, come line up!

334
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:41,408
[HYAKUZAWA]
Guess I take that back.

335
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:49,416
[KEISHIN]
Kakugawa and their monster
No.9... They're going to be
pretty damn scary next year.

336
00:18:57,658 --> 00:19:00,728
[RYUNOSUKE & YU]
Kiyoko, we'll hold
your baggage for you!

337
00:19:00,828 --> 00:19:02,963
[KIYOKO]
Uh I already took care
of most of it.

338
00:19:03,063 --> 00:19:05,165
(RYUNOSUKE & YU feeling useless)
[DAICHI] Hey! Let's move it,
guys.

339
00:19:05,265 --> 00:19:08,669
[KIYOKO]
Say Yachi. I'm gonna go check to
see if we've forgotten anything.

340
00:19:08,769 --> 00:19:11,972
[KIYOKO] You can go on
ahead if you want.
[HITOKA] Okay!

341
00:19:12,072 --> 00:19:16,611
[TOBIO]
You've gotten pretty good at
attacking, but your receives are
still absolute dog‐pile.

342
00:19:16,711 --> 00:19:18,679
[TOBIO]
And did you really have
to yell "hyaah!"?

343
00:19:18,779 --> 00:19:20,815
[SHOYO]
Hey I got the stupid
point didn't I?

344
00:19:20,915 --> 00:19:23,017
[YU] "hgya!"
[RYUNOSUKE] "hgya"?
(SHOYO shocked)

345
00:19:23,117 --> 00:19:25,052
[CHIKARA]
Oh by the way...
I'm sure you guys

346
00:19:25,152 --> 00:19:28,523
[CHIKARA] are all doing your
summer break homework, right?
[YU & RYUNOSUKE] "hgya!"

347
00:19:28,623 --> 00:19:33,027
[CHIKARA]
And I'm sure you remember how
I said I wasn't gonna help you,
right? Right?

348
00:19:33,127 --> 00:19:35,596
[TADASHI]
Ennoshita is such a smarty...

349
00:19:35,696 --> 00:19:37,431
(SHOYO focused)

350
00:19:37,532 --> 00:19:39,299
[HITOKA]
Hinata? Is something wrong?

351
00:19:39,399 --> 00:19:41,268
[SHOYO]
This is it Yachi.

352
00:19:41,368 --> 00:19:43,003
We'll finally get to stand in
the same court as

353
00:19:43,103 --> 00:19:45,205
the Great King and Ushiwaka!

354
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:47,307
[TOBIO]
Hmm...

355
00:19:47,407 --> 00:19:50,144
[SHOYO]
(shriek) Oh man
I forgot my lunchbox!

356
00:19:50,244 --> 00:19:51,546
(TOBIO yawn)

357
00:19:51,646 --> 00:19:53,313
[TERUSHIMA]
Come on, it's just
your phone number.

358
00:19:53,413 --> 00:19:54,649
What's the big deal, girl?

359
00:19:54,749 --> 00:19:56,884
[KIYOKO] I don't think so...
(SHOYO surprised)

360
00:19:56,984 --> 00:20:00,588
[KIYOKO] Yeah no... I uh
have someone waiting for me.
[SHOYO]
(shock) Wah, someone's

361
00:20:00,688 --> 00:20:04,692
[TERUSHIMA] Doesn't take long to
share a phone number. C'mon.
[SHOYO]
And Tanaka and Nishinoya

362
00:20:04,792 --> 00:20:06,694
[KIYOKO]
I'm sorry, guys. I've gotta go.

363
00:20:06,794 --> 00:20:08,729
[TERUSHIMA]
Just gimme your digits. It'll
only take a second, Darlin'.

364
00:20:08,829 --> 00:20:14,134
[SHOYO]
GAHH! (freaking out) Oh hey
Kiyoko!

365
00:20:14,234 --> 00:20:17,638
(KIYOKO surprised, panicked)
[SHOYO]
I see you found my lunchbox!
Thanks! That's great! Let's get

366
00:20:17,738 --> 00:20:20,708
[TERUSHIMA]
Hold it, hang on.
We weren't finished talking yet!

367
00:20:20,808 --> 00:20:24,378
[KIYOKO] Hey! Hinata!
[TERUSHIMA] Now where were we?
Oh yeah your number.

368
00:20:24,478 --> 00:20:26,113
[SHOYO] Excuse me!
(KIYOKO surprised)

369
00:20:26,213 --> 00:20:29,584
[TERUSHIMA, internal]
Whoa! This little fella
has some ups...! Oh?

370
00:20:32,152 --> 00:20:33,854
[TERUSHIMA]
Karasuno...

371
00:20:33,954 --> 00:20:35,990
[SHOYO]
Kiyoko is extremely busy,
she's our manager

372
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:38,626
[SHOYO]
and we really need her for some
important team business right
now.

373
00:20:38,726 --> 00:20:41,529
[TERUSHIMA]
Oooh. You guys beat that 6'7"
guy. That's not bad.

374
00:20:41,629 --> 00:20:44,164
[SHOYO]
(startled) Um well,
yeah.. we did.

375
00:20:44,264 --> 00:20:50,104
[TERUSHIMA]
Aw maaaan... I was hoping to
play against that big fella,
this is so saaad.

376
00:20:50,204 --> 00:20:51,506
[SHOYO]
Play against him?

377
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,908
So it was a pretty exciting
first round wasn't?

378
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:57,778
[SHOYO]
Um... are you on one of the
teams that got past the first
round?

379
00:20:57,878 --> 00:21:01,181
[TERUSHIMA]
You kidding? Yeah sorry we
didn't have to play in the first
round.

380
00:21:01,281 --> 00:21:05,119
[SHOYO]
Oh! So. You were in the top
eight in the preliminaries?

381
00:21:05,219 --> 00:21:07,555
[TERUSHIMA]
Well. More like the top four.

382
00:21:07,655 --> 00:21:09,857
[SHOYO]
Wait the... the top four?!

383
00:21:09,957 --> 00:21:14,228
[TERUSHIMA]
Later, kid. If we do end up
going against each other in the
tournament...

384
00:21:14,328 --> 00:21:17,497
I'm sure it'll be
a real good time.

385
00:21:18,398 --> 00:21:20,835
[SHOYO]
(curious) Who was... that guy?

386
00:21:20,935 --> 00:21:24,672
[SHOYO]
So uh... I guess he doesn't need
your phone number anymore. So
that's good.

387
00:21:24,772 --> 00:21:30,244
[KIYOKO]
(sigh of relief) Yeah for some
reason, all his attention
completely shifted over to you.

388
00:21:30,344 --> 00:21:35,249
[KIYOKO]
Anyway, thank you. That was nice
of you. Oh. Here's your lunch.

389
00:21:35,349 --> 00:21:36,884
(SHOYO embarrassed)

390
00:21:36,984 --> 00:21:39,119
[KIYOKO]
That wrapping for your lunchbox
is different.

391
00:21:39,219 --> 00:21:43,057
[SHOYO]
(shock) Oh no. That's not...
it's my little sister's,

392
00:21:43,157 --> 00:21:45,092
it's not mine...!
Definitely not mine.

393
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:46,594
(KIYOKO gentle laugh)

394
00:21:47,695 --> 00:21:49,864
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey Noya. Kiyoko is a bit late?

395
00:21:49,964 --> 00:21:51,599
[YU]
I don't like it.

396
00:21:59,607 --> 00:22:01,141
(TERUSHIMA & BOBATA
intimidating)

397
00:22:01,241 --> 00:22:04,311
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey... What are you lookin' at‐

398
00:22:05,145 --> 00:22:07,515
(DAICHI annoyed)
(YU whistles)

399
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:13,320
[SHOYO]
Sorry about that guys!

400
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,922
[TOBIO]
Try and get your crap together,
dumbass!

401
00:22:15,022 --> 00:22:17,324
[YU & RYUNOSUKE]
Kiyoko, we're glad
that you were safe!

402
00:22:17,424 --> 00:22:19,359
[DAICHI]
Did you find
everything you needed?

403
00:22:19,459 --> 00:22:21,929
[KIYOKO] His lunch.
Look how adorable it is.
[SHOYO] (mortified)
Aw man. Kiyoko!

404
00:22:22,029 --> 00:22:25,566
(YU, TOBIO, DAICHI, & KEI
laughing, mocking)

405
00:23:55,690 --> 00:23:57,658
[RYUNOSUKE]
Is some loser making
moves on Kiyoko?!

406
00:23:57,758 --> 00:23:59,359
[YU]
That is total bullcrap!

407
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,495
[RYUNOSUKE]
From now on, we don't ever let
her out of our sight!

408
00:24:01,596 --> 00:24:04,331
[RYUNOSUKE] We'll take turns
going to the bathroom, if we
have to!
[YU] Yeah!

409
