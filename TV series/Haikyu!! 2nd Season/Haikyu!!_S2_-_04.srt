1
00:00:02,975 --> 00:00:04,276
[YU]
Whoa, is that...?!

2
00:00:04,376 --> 00:00:05,512
[RYUNOSUKE]
I think it is!

3
00:00:05,612 --> 00:00:07,346
[YU & RYUNOSUKE]
The Skytree!

4
00:00:07,446 --> 00:00:09,816
[KAI]
Nah. That's just a regular old
steel tower.

5
00:00:09,916 --> 00:00:11,283
(KUROO laughing)

6
00:00:11,383 --> 00:00:15,788
[RYUNOSUKE & YU]
(excited yell) We're in Tokyo!

7
00:00:15,888 --> 00:00:19,191
[ASAHI]
It doesn't seem that much
different from back home in
Miyagi...

8
00:00:19,291 --> 00:00:21,528
[KOSHI]
Well, we ARE out in
the suburbs y'know.

9
00:00:21,628 --> 00:00:22,261
(KEI yawn)

10
00:00:22,361 --> 00:00:23,896
[YU]
Wake up already!

11
00:00:24,564 --> 00:00:25,998
[KUROO]
Wait a second...

12
00:00:26,098 --> 00:00:28,968
[KUROO]
Aren't you missing a few guys?

13
00:00:29,068 --> 00:00:30,637
[DAICHI]
Well, you see...

14
00:00:35,975 --> 00:00:37,644
[YU]
Witness the true power...

15
00:00:37,744 --> 00:00:39,579
[RYUNOSUKE]
...of the second‐years!

16
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:42,381
(RYUNOSUKE & YU powering up)

17
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,919
I wouldn't brag; the cutoff is
a 40 and you barely passed.

18
00:00:47,019 --> 00:00:48,555
(RYUNOSUKE & YU realize)

19
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:51,390
[KOSHI]
Huh? Hinata failed English?
What happened?

20
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:56,328
[KEI]
Well right as the test ended...
he realized that all his answers
were off by one question number.

21
00:00:56,428 --> 00:00:58,097
[ASAHI]
Oh... That's not good...

22
00:00:58,197 --> 00:01:01,000
Ms. Ono's not the type of
teacher who'd let that
kind of thing slide.

23
00:01:01,100 --> 00:01:04,236
[TADASHI]
Yachi didn't really take the
news too well, she was freakin'.

24
00:01:04,336 --> 00:01:08,575
[HITOKA]
They're all correct...
every last one!

25
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,510
[DAICHI]
Kageyama failed Japanese?

26
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:14,280
[CHIKARA]
He said he didn't expect so
many reading comprehension
problems...

27
00:01:14,380 --> 00:01:15,982
[CHIKARA]
He focused too hard on
memorization.

28
00:01:16,082 --> 00:01:18,685
[ASAHI]
Oh wow! His kanji's perfect
though; that's crazy!

29
00:01:18,785 --> 00:01:23,355
Well, no need to be too
upset... There'll be other
trips after this okay.

30
00:01:23,455 --> 00:01:25,457
[TOBIO] How do we
get to Tokyo now?!
[KOSHI] Uh...

31
00:01:25,558 --> 00:01:27,760
Let's walk there!
Or bike!

32
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,029
[KOSHI, internal]
What is wrong with these guys?!

33
00:01:31,063 --> 00:01:32,331
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey... Dork wads.

34
00:01:32,431 --> 00:01:34,200
[TOBIO] Hm?
[SHOYO] Huh?

35
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,968
(RYUNOSUKE grin)

36
00:01:36,068 --> 00:01:39,071
[KUROO]
So the dynamic duo had to stay
and take supplementary lessons?

37
00:01:39,171 --> 00:01:42,041
[DAICHI]
Well uh... That's
not exactly uhm...

38
00:01:42,141 --> 00:01:43,409
(YAMAMOTO excited yell)

39
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:45,845
[YAMAMOTO]
There's... TWO OF THEM!

40
00:01:45,945 --> 00:01:53,019
[YAMAMOTO]
One's the sexy kind and one's
the cute kind! I'M NOT WORTHY OF
SUCH A BLESSING! (wailing)

41
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:55,955
[HITOKA, internal]
A mohawk... Welcome to Tokyo!

42
00:01:56,055 --> 00:01:58,725
[RYUNOSUKE] Take a
good look Tiger head.
(YAMAMOTO gasp)

43
00:01:58,825 --> 00:02:01,528
[RYUNOSUKE]
Behold the glory of
going to Karasuno High.

44
00:02:01,628 --> 00:02:03,495
[YAMAMOTO]
Agh! Hot n' shiny.

45
00:02:03,596 --> 00:02:04,396
(RYUNOSUKE maniacal laughter)

46
00:02:04,496 --> 00:02:05,431
[KIYOKO]
Let's go.

47
00:02:05,532 --> 00:02:07,366
[HITOKA]
O‐okay...

48
00:02:10,069 --> 00:02:13,239
[KUROO]
Well, you guys feel free
to head to the gym whenever
you're ready.

49
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:16,876
[KUROO]
The rest of our players are
already there, and we'll be
waiting for you.

50
00:02:16,976 --> 00:02:18,845
[DAICHI]
Got it.

51
00:03:52,772 --> 00:03:54,874
(after class chatter)

52
00:03:54,974 --> 00:03:59,211
[ONO] Oh, wow! I can't believe
how serious you two are!

53
00:03:59,311 --> 00:04:00,680
(SHOYO determined)

54
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:03,282
[RYUNOSUKE]
You both only failed one
subject, right?

55
00:04:03,382 --> 00:04:08,154
[RYUNOSUKE]
If that's the case, you should
be able to finish all your
makeup work in the morning.

56
00:04:08,254 --> 00:04:12,358
Once you've done that...
I'll send in the cavalry.

57
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:15,494
(school bell ringing)

58
00:04:15,595 --> 00:04:17,329
(TOBIO & SHOYO serious running)

59
00:04:17,429 --> 00:04:19,566
[ONO]
Good luck guys!

60
00:04:22,234 --> 00:04:24,170
[SAEKO]
'Sup, Einsteins?

61
00:04:25,538 --> 00:04:26,773
[SAEKO]
You ready?

62
00:04:26,873 --> 00:04:28,474
(TOBIO & SHOYO nervous gulp)

63
00:04:28,575 --> 00:04:30,877
[SHOYO]
Hey! You're Tanaka's
older sister!

64
00:04:30,977 --> 00:04:33,880
[SAEKO]
Saeko, but you can
call me Big Sis.

65
00:04:33,980 --> 00:04:38,284
Don't worry, I can get you two
geniuses to Tokyo in a flash.

66
00:04:38,384 --> 00:04:40,119
[SHOYO & TOBIO]
Okay Big Sis!

67
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:42,889
[SAEKO]
Now let's hit the road!

68
00:04:42,989 --> 00:04:44,223
[SHOYO]
Right!

69
00:04:55,167 --> 00:04:59,706
(bing‐bong)
[RYUNOSUKE]
I CANNOT GUARANTEE it will be a
safe or comfortable ride.

70
00:04:59,806 --> 00:05:04,376
[RYUNOSUKE]
Enter the vehicle at your own
risk. For love of God, please
buckle up!

71
00:05:04,476 --> 00:05:06,846
(SHOYO & TOBIO screaming)

72
00:05:06,946 --> 00:05:09,181
[SAEKO]
(giggling) Woohoo!

73
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:12,652
[SAEKO]
Yeahh!

74
00:05:14,253 --> 00:05:16,823
[KEISHIN]
Coach Nekomata. It's
good to see you, sir.

75
00:05:16,923 --> 00:05:18,791
[NEKOMATA]
Oh no, pleasure's all mine.

76
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,492
[TAKEDA]
It was really generous of
you to let us be a part

77
00:05:20,593 --> 00:05:22,128
of the joint practice
session, sir.

78
00:05:22,228 --> 00:05:24,030
[TAKEDA]
Thank you so much
for having us here.

79
00:05:24,130 --> 00:05:26,498
Oh, don't think for a second
we're not benefitting

80
00:05:26,599 --> 00:05:28,200
from this arrangement too...

81
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,638
It's a great opportunity for
both of us to see just where
you stand.

82
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:33,105
(KEISHIN & TAKEDA awkward)

83
00:05:33,205 --> 00:05:34,807
[KURASUNO]
Ready!

84
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,345
(Practice drills )

85
00:05:39,445 --> 00:05:41,748
[KENMA]
Hey... Shoyo's not here.

86
00:05:41,848 --> 00:05:43,816
[YAMAMOTO]
He got stuck at school.

87
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,184
Yeah?

88
00:05:54,493 --> 00:05:57,697
[KUROO]
After you and your teammates
finish warming up, you'll be
in this group.

89
00:05:57,797 --> 00:06:01,000
[KUROO] Then everyone will
rotate teams every game.
[DAICHI] Sounds good.

90
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:05,037
[KUROO]
And after each set, all of the
losing teams have to do a flying
lap around the court.

91
00:06:05,137 --> 00:06:07,507
(DAICHI acknowledges)
[HITOKA] What's a flying‐lap?

92
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:11,644
[KIYOKO]
It's similar to the motion
they do for a flying receive,
intercepting the ball in midair.

93
00:06:11,744 --> 00:06:15,481
[KIYOKO]
For a flying lap, they slide
along the ground with their
hands close to their chests.

94
00:06:15,582 --> 00:06:18,217
[KUROO]
The match list is over there if
you want to take a look at it.
[KOSHI]

95
00:06:18,317 --> 00:06:20,987
[KUROO] I'm pretty sure your
first match will be against the
Shinzen team.
[KOSHI]

96
00:06:21,087 --> 00:06:22,722
[ASAHI] Hmm? (startled)
[DAICHI] Great, thanks.

97
00:06:22,822 --> 00:06:24,524
[ASAHI]
You mean the guy staring at us?

98
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,492
[KOSHI]
Yeah.

99
00:06:26,593 --> 00:06:28,861
[ASAHI]
Nope. Never seen him before.

100
00:06:32,164 --> 00:06:33,165
(TOBIO snoring)

101
00:06:33,265 --> 00:06:34,867
(SHOYO uneasy)

102
00:06:36,435 --> 00:06:39,772
[SAEKO]
Aw, don't stress yourself out,
kid. I understand you're in a
hurry.

103
00:06:39,872 --> 00:06:41,608
[SHOYO]
Oh? (struggle)

104
00:06:42,709 --> 00:06:44,844
But the way I see it, if
you never take a detour,

105
00:06:44,944 --> 00:06:46,813
then you might never get
to see the flowers.

106
00:06:46,913 --> 00:06:50,817
Yeah I have no idea what
that means, but I'll take
your word for it.

107
00:06:50,917 --> 00:06:53,986
Oh my god... You should be
thankful you failed that exam;

108
00:06:54,086 --> 00:06:55,888
or you wouldn't've taken this
little road trip with me!

109
00:06:55,988 --> 00:06:57,423
(SAEKO catches herself)

110
00:06:57,524 --> 00:06:59,091
(TOBIO bumps head, snorts)

111
00:06:59,191 --> 00:07:02,128
You must really love
your volleyball to go
through all this, kid.

112
00:07:02,228 --> 00:07:05,331
[SHOYO] Yup!
[SAEKO] So what got you into
it in the first place?

113
00:07:05,431 --> 00:07:10,136
(surprised) In middle
school, I saw the Spring
Nationals on TV!

114
00:07:10,236 --> 00:07:12,605
[SHOYO]
Karasuno happened
to be playing, so...

115
00:07:12,705 --> 00:07:15,975
[SHOYO] I saw the Tiny Giant!
[SAEKO] You saw the Tiny Giant?
Guess you did.

116
00:07:16,075 --> 00:07:18,144
(SHOYO shocked)
[SAEKO] What... did
that freak you out?

117
00:07:18,244 --> 00:07:21,147
[SHOYO]
Wait a second you know
about the Tiny Giant too?!

118
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:24,050
[SAEKO]
I'm pretty certain we were in
the same grade! (soft laugh)

119
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,552
(SHOYO mindblown)

120
00:07:25,652 --> 00:07:28,120
[SAEKO]
I never talked to him though.
If he'd been a troublemaker,

121
00:07:28,220 --> 00:07:30,322
[SAEKO]
we probably would have
hung out all the time.

122
00:07:30,422 --> 00:07:33,526
[SHOYO]
So you're one of those girls
who's attracted to like bad boys
and stuff?

123
00:07:33,626 --> 00:07:35,427
[SAEKO]
(laugh) Is that a thing?!

124
00:07:35,528 --> 00:07:37,396
(TOBIO grumbles sleepily)

125
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:38,531
[SAEKO]
Anyway...

126
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:42,569
(machine beep)
(gym chatter)

127
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:45,471
[SAEKO]
When I used to see him playing
in practice matches...

128
00:07:45,572 --> 00:07:50,209
[SAEKO]
that kid was scarier to me than
any tough guy I'd ever met.

129
00:07:50,309 --> 00:07:53,479
[SHOYO] Huh?
[SAEKO] Maybe intimidating's
a better word.

130
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,948
[SHOYO] So you mean
his spikes, or uh...?
[SAEKO] No...

131
00:07:56,048 --> 00:08:01,788
[SAEKO]
There was one time they subbed
him out. I guess maybe he wasn't
feeling well.

132
00:08:13,232 --> 00:08:14,701
(scared gasp)

133
00:08:14,801 --> 00:08:15,868
(SHOYO question)

134
00:08:15,968 --> 00:08:17,403
He was one of those
"ace players"

135
00:08:17,504 --> 00:08:19,506
or whatever you guys call them.

136
00:08:19,606 --> 00:08:23,576
[SAEKO]
I'm sure being the ace inspires
this crazy amount of pride and
confidence, right?

137
00:08:23,676 --> 00:08:26,378
Well, that guy was
dripping with it.

138
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:31,984
[SAEKO]
I think I almost fell in love
with him! (laugh)

139
00:08:32,084 --> 00:08:34,320
Besides... when the
ace is in play...

140
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:36,589
[SAEKO]
...all the other guys are on
their game.

141
00:08:36,689 --> 00:08:41,393
That's 'cause nobody wants to be
a hundred percent dependent on
him, you know?

142
00:08:41,493 --> 00:08:44,063
[TOBIO, groggily]
You really know a lot about the
Tiny Giant, don'tcha.

143
00:08:44,163 --> 00:08:48,200
[SAEKO]
(startled) I‐I never said that!
I just saw a few of his stupid
games, that's all!

144
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,136
[SAEKO]
(chomp) When the hell did you
wake up?

145
00:08:50,236 --> 00:08:51,738
[TOBIO]
Got hungry. (chewing)

146
00:08:51,838 --> 00:08:53,706
[SAEKO]
You're a simple
creature, aren't you?

147
00:08:53,806 --> 00:08:55,575
[TOBIO]
(belch) Yup.

148
00:08:55,675 --> 00:08:57,043
It won't make you any better

149
00:08:57,143 --> 00:08:59,478
and it certainly won't
make our team worse.

150
00:08:59,579 --> 00:09:05,084
[SHOYO, internal]
A crazy amount of pride and
confidence.. that comes from
being the ace...

151
00:09:06,586 --> 00:09:13,125
Well, it's just a little
further... Let's step on it!
Woooooo!

152
00:09:13,993 --> 00:09:14,994
[DAICHI]
No. 7!

153
00:09:15,094 --> 00:09:17,096
[ASAHI]
One blocker!

154
00:09:18,931 --> 00:09:20,066
[CHIKARA]
Nice receive, Nishinoya!

155
00:09:20,166 --> 00:09:22,101
[BOKUTO]
Okay... let's go left guys!

156
00:09:22,702 --> 00:09:23,435
(whistle)

157
00:09:23,536 --> 00:09:24,737
[ASAHI]
Man!

158
00:09:24,837 --> 00:09:27,173
(long whistle)

159
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:30,309
[TAKEDA]
They're just as strong
as we expected.

160
00:09:30,409 --> 00:09:31,310
[KEISHIN]
Yeah.

161
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:32,579
[DAICHI]
One flying lap!

162
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:35,214
[ALL]
Yessir!

163
00:09:35,314 --> 00:09:38,017
[KEISHIN]
It's not that we're playing a
bad game or anything.

164
00:09:38,117 --> 00:09:40,653
I mean these guys are
national‐level players.

165
00:09:40,753 --> 00:09:41,854
(whistle)
[SENGOKU] Serve's up!

166
00:09:41,954 --> 00:09:43,289
(KEISHIN surprised)

167
00:09:47,293 --> 00:09:49,295
[OGANO]
Oooh, real nice, ponytail!

168
00:09:49,395 --> 00:09:51,363
[HITOKA]
(skittish) That's powerful!

169
00:09:51,463 --> 00:09:54,601
[KIYOKO]
Every member of that team has
an especially good serve.

170
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:59,271
[HITOKA]
Oh, right, Ubugawa's manager did
say they put a lot of effort
into serving.

171
00:09:59,371 --> 00:10:01,941
[KIYOKO]
That's right. I guess ending
every practice with

172
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,476
a hundred serves must
really make a difference.

173
00:10:04,577 --> 00:10:06,045
[SENGOKU]
Give us another one!

174
00:10:10,082 --> 00:10:13,820
[KIYOKO]
At Ubugawa High School, serves
are their specialty.

175
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,722
(ASAHI tense breathing)

176
00:10:15,822 --> 00:10:19,291
They're good, but if we
can hit that serve back
at 'em, just once...

177
00:10:19,391 --> 00:10:20,827
[OGANO]
Bring it!

178
00:10:25,097 --> 00:10:27,900
[HITOKA]
Whoa, all of them went after it
at the same time!

179
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,136
[OGANO]
Oh yeah gimme summa that!

180
00:10:30,236 --> 00:10:30,937
(whistle)

181
00:10:31,037 --> 00:10:32,505
[KIYOKO]
Y'see that combo?

182
00:10:32,605 --> 00:10:34,974
[HITOKA]
Yikes... They're all popping up
out of nowhere,

183
00:10:35,074 --> 00:10:37,844
so I can't tell which one of
them is going to hit the ball!

184
00:10:37,944 --> 00:10:41,480
[OGANO]
(proud smirk) All riiiight!

185
00:10:41,581 --> 00:10:45,451
[KIYOKO]
Shinzen High School:
Masters of Combo Moves.

186
00:10:45,552 --> 00:10:47,153
(RYUNOSUKE uneasy)

187
00:10:47,253 --> 00:10:50,256
[TAKEDA]
And of course...
there's our sworn rivals.

188
00:10:50,356 --> 00:10:52,091
[YAMAMOTO]
Yaku!

189
00:10:52,191 --> 00:10:55,628
[KEISHIN]
I see that receive is as
flawless as ever.

190
00:10:55,728 --> 00:11:01,868
[TAKEDA]
No matter what, they always dig
in, connect, and strike back.
They're a solid team.

191
00:11:01,968 --> 00:11:03,836
[YAKU]
Double block!

192
00:11:03,936 --> 00:11:06,272
[KEISHIN] No joke.
[KONOHA] Sorry! Cover!

193
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:09,909
[BOKUTO]
Akaashi!

194
00:11:10,009 --> 00:11:11,578
[TAKEDA] Just like
Shiratorizawa...
[AKAASHI] Bokuto!

195
00:11:11,678 --> 00:11:13,212
[BOKUTO]
I got it!

196
00:11:13,312 --> 00:11:15,982
[TAKEDA]
They've got one of the top five
aces in the nation.

197
00:11:16,983 --> 00:11:17,750
(whistle)

198
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:18,818
[TADASHI]
Tsukki!

199
00:11:18,918 --> 00:11:19,852
(KEI surprised)

200
00:11:19,952 --> 00:11:21,588
Don't you run from it, Kenma!

201
00:11:21,688 --> 00:11:24,056
[KENMA] It'll take
my arms off...
[NEKOMATA] It will not!

202
00:11:24,156 --> 00:11:26,392
[TAKEDA]
I'm so glad we got to
be a part of this.

203
00:11:26,492 --> 00:11:32,832
[BOKUTO]
Aw yeah, baby! You like that?
Whoooo's the greatest of all
time?!

204
00:11:32,932 --> 00:11:40,006
[TAKEDA]
A powerhouse at the national
level with a legendary ace.
Fukurodani Academy!

205
00:11:40,106 --> 00:11:42,909
[TAKEDA]
It's great we get to face
a team like them.

206
00:11:43,009 --> 00:11:45,277
[KEISHIN] Pretty cool.
(KEI grunt)

207
00:11:45,377 --> 00:11:49,415
[KEISHIN]
Still... This isn't the time to
be intimidated by their skill.

208
00:11:49,516 --> 00:11:53,953
[KEISHIN]
We have to focus on going
toe‐to‐toe with these guys.

209
00:11:58,525 --> 00:11:59,992
(long whistle)

210
00:12:00,092 --> 00:12:02,695
[DAICHI]
Let's go! One flying lap, guys!

211
00:12:02,795 --> 00:12:05,297
[ALL]
Yessir!

212
00:12:05,397 --> 00:12:07,466
[SHINZEN A]
How many losses has
it been for them?

213
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:10,903
[SHINZEN B]
They're not really weak or
anything... it's more like...
normal.

214
00:12:11,003 --> 00:12:14,541
[FUKURODANI A]
Which first‐year is the one
Nekoma had trouble with?

215
00:12:14,641 --> 00:12:17,476
[FUKURODANI A]
Maybe Nekoma was too cocky.

216
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:19,211
(HITOKA offended grumble)

217
00:12:19,311 --> 00:12:21,480
[KIYOKO]
It's okay, Yachi,
just ignore those guys.

218
00:12:21,581 --> 00:12:25,985
Don't worry. If what Tanaka says
is true, then we'll be alright.

219
00:12:26,085 --> 00:12:31,090
[SAEKO]
(out of breath) Oh, good,
they're still at it... We made
it just in the nick of time.

220
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:35,061
[YU] Big sis!
[ASAHI] I had no idea you
had a sister, Nishinoya.
[SAEKO] Heeey!

221
00:12:35,161 --> 00:12:36,763
[YU]
No, that's Tanaka's sister!

222
00:12:36,863 --> 00:12:38,064
[KOSHI]
Oh yeah, I see it.

223
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:39,398
[SAEKO]
What's up bro?

224
00:12:39,498 --> 00:12:41,768
(panting) Glad you dummies
could make it out.

225
00:12:41,868 --> 00:12:43,335
(TOBIO & SHOYO heavy panting)

226
00:12:43,435 --> 00:12:44,871
(SAEKO grin)

227
00:12:44,971 --> 00:12:48,274
[KUROO]
So the main characters show up
fashionably late, huh?

228
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,476
[KUROO]
Oh how tackyyy.

229
00:12:50,577 --> 00:12:51,878
[BOKUTO]
Oh?

230
00:12:51,978 --> 00:12:53,212
(AKAASHI exhale)

231
00:12:53,312 --> 00:12:54,814
(TAKEDA, KEISHIN, KIYOKO,
& HITOKA excited)

232
00:12:54,914 --> 00:12:56,448
(NEKOMATA satisfied smirk)

233
00:12:58,951 --> 00:13:04,156
(TOBIO & SHOYO panting)

234
00:13:20,773 --> 00:13:22,575
(whistle)
[OGANO]
Serve's up!

235
00:13:24,143 --> 00:13:25,612
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice receive!

236
00:13:28,748 --> 00:13:29,749
(whistle)

237
00:13:29,849 --> 00:13:31,150
[KONOHA]
Whoa, what's with that?

238
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:32,619
[ONAGA]
That was like stupid fast...

239
00:13:32,719 --> 00:13:35,021
[KOMI]
I've never seen a
quick attack like that.

240
00:13:35,121 --> 00:13:36,422
[OGANO]
We'll stop the next one!

241
00:13:36,523 --> 00:13:37,890
[YOSHIKAWA & CHIGAYA]
Yeah!
(whistle)

242
00:13:37,990 --> 00:13:39,358
[DAICHI]
Here we go!

243
00:13:42,695 --> 00:13:44,564
[AKATANI]
Sorry! Cover!

244
00:13:44,664 --> 00:13:47,600
[BOKUTO] Hot damn, that's
what I call a great serve!
[OGANO] Come on, Eikichi!

245
00:13:48,735 --> 00:13:50,603
[CHIGAYA] Tch! (shock)
[KOSHI] Nice one, Hinata!

246
00:13:50,703 --> 00:13:53,272
[OGANO]
You take care of
Number 10, Eikichi!

247
00:13:58,377 --> 00:14:00,613
(whistle) (long whistle)

248
00:14:00,713 --> 00:14:03,082
[CHIGAYA]
Dammit! I barely grazed
it! He's too fast!

249
00:14:03,182 --> 00:14:06,853
[OGANO]
Those guys can't just bust in
here with a crazy quick‐attack
like that!

250
00:14:06,953 --> 00:14:10,289
(TOBIO & SHOYO panting)

251
00:14:10,389 --> 00:14:13,826
[RYUNOSUKE]
Turd‐nuggets who show up late
don't get to show off.
(TOBIO & SHOYO mortified)

252
00:14:13,926 --> 00:14:15,862
[OGANO]
Flying laps. C'mon.

253
00:14:15,962 --> 00:14:17,396
[SHINZEN]
Yessir!

254
00:14:18,898 --> 00:14:20,700
[DAICHI]
It took 'til our ninth set,

255
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,636
but we finally won a match
so we dodged the flying lap.

256
00:14:23,736 --> 00:14:25,371
[YU]
I'm starving!

257
00:14:25,471 --> 00:14:28,841
(whistle)
[SENGOKU] Nice serve!

258
00:14:28,941 --> 00:14:32,078
[RYUNOSUKE]
Looks like it's Ubugawa against
Nekoma playing over there.

259
00:14:32,178 --> 00:14:35,081
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's late now... I bet that'll
be the last game today.

260
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:38,084
[YU]
Yeah.

261
00:14:38,184 --> 00:14:41,721
[SHOYO, internal]
They managed to keep up with
our quick attack in the second
half.

262
00:14:42,955 --> 00:14:48,528
(internal) Date Tech...
Seijoh... and that Inuoka guy...

263
00:14:48,628 --> 00:14:54,433
(internal)
I guess I can't expect it to
work forever. Especially against
the faster opponents.

264
00:14:54,534 --> 00:14:56,536
[INUOKA]
Yaku! Nice receive!

265
00:14:57,169 --> 00:14:58,370
[SHOYO]
Wait a sec...

266
00:14:58,470 --> 00:14:59,839
[SHOYO]
Inuoka swapped out?

267
00:14:59,939 --> 00:15:00,907
[SHIBAYAMA]
Single blocker!

268
00:15:01,007 --> 00:15:02,542
[INUOKA]
You got this, Lev!

269
00:15:03,109 --> 00:15:04,644
(SHOYO gasp)

270
00:15:09,516 --> 00:15:11,450
(whistle) (NEKOMA cheers)

271
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:16,288
[SHOYO]
That swing was just like a
whip... How'd he do that?

272
00:15:16,388 --> 00:15:17,557
[ASAHI]
Amazing...

273
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:19,759
[KOSHI]
He's even taller than he looks.

274
00:15:19,859 --> 00:15:23,495
[KOSHI]
You can't tell at first because
he hunches so much, but he's
pretty big.

275
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:25,632
[KOSHI]
I'd say he's at least 6'3".

276
00:15:25,732 --> 00:15:27,867
[ASAHI]
Look how long his arms are.

277
00:15:27,967 --> 00:15:30,136
[KOSHI]
Is he even human?

278
00:15:32,104 --> 00:15:36,308
(whistle) (long whistle)
(NEKOMA cheers)

279
00:15:36,408 --> 00:15:38,545
[OGANO]
What the hell is up with
these Karasuno guys?

280
00:15:38,645 --> 00:15:41,247
That setter? And that
tiny middle‐blocker?!

281
00:15:41,347 --> 00:15:43,149
[GOURA]
They did a number on you.

282
00:15:43,249 --> 00:15:45,885
[OGANO]
Oh Shut up! You try facing down
one of those quick‐attacks!

283
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:47,987
[OGANO]
I'd like to see one of you
jerk‐holes handle it better!

284
00:15:48,087 --> 00:15:53,392
[BOKUTO]
(amused laugh) Well this is
about to be an interesting year.

285
00:15:54,193 --> 00:15:55,962
[KUROO]
Thank you for the games!

286
00:15:56,062 --> 00:15:59,832
[EVERYONE]
Thank you for the games!

287
00:15:59,932 --> 00:16:02,869
[INUOKA]
Y'know. Your quick‐attacks were
just as great as always, Hinata!

288
00:16:02,969 --> 00:16:06,906
[SHOYO]
Thanks but... we don't seem
to be improving very much.

289
00:16:07,373 --> 00:16:08,708
[INUOKA]
Hm?

290
00:16:09,742 --> 00:16:11,844
[SHOYO, internal]
We're just like before.

291
00:16:11,944 --> 00:16:15,381
[SHOYO, internal]
Hm... The whole point of coming
here was to get stronger.

292
00:16:16,348 --> 00:16:18,017
[SHOYO]
Oh! That's right...

293
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:20,720
I was gonna ask you guys,
what's with that big tall
middle blocker?

294
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:24,290
[KENMA]
Oh... That's Lev Haiba,
first‐year.

295
00:16:24,390 --> 00:16:26,425
He's half‐Russian,
half‐Japanese.

296
00:16:26,526 --> 00:16:29,495
[SHOYO]
Half‐Russian?
No way! That's cool!

297
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:31,430
[SHOYO]
His name is... what now?

298
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:34,000
[KENMA]
His name's Lev...
It's Russian for...

299
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,935
I think it's like... "tiger"?

300
00:16:36,035 --> 00:16:38,070
[INUOKA]
No, not tiger... it's Lion!

301
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:40,006
[SHOYO]
He's new, isn't he?

302
00:16:40,106 --> 00:16:43,576
[KENMA]
Yeah... he just started playing
volleyball this school year.

303
00:16:43,676 --> 00:16:48,414
[KENMA]
When we went to see you guys
during Golden Week, he was still
learning the ropes.

304
00:16:48,515 --> 00:16:51,684
[KENMA]
We only took the players we
already had on the bench.

305
00:16:51,784 --> 00:16:53,820
[SHOYO]
THAT GUY's new to volleyball?!

306
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,757
[KENMA]
Yeah... It was tough for me
because I kept getting paired
with him.

307
00:16:57,857 --> 00:17:03,029
[KENMA]
I tried to adjust to him, but
our timing was always weird.
It's gotten better, though.

308
00:17:03,129 --> 00:17:07,166
[SHOYO] Whoa...
[INUOKA] Yeah well... You didn't
seem too stressed out about it.

309
00:17:07,266 --> 00:17:09,569
[SHOYO]
So even Kenma gets
caught off guard!

310
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:12,338
[KENMA]
Well, he's just kinduv
a strange person...

311
00:17:12,438 --> 00:17:16,809
[KENMA]
He's mostly relying on his
instincts and physical ability
at the moment.

312
00:17:16,909 --> 00:17:18,310
[KENMA]
Plus his height.

313
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:20,647
[SHOYO]
Heck yeah! He's way too tall,
it's not fair!

314
00:17:20,747 --> 00:17:24,316
[INUOKA]
I cannot believe that
guy's luck! But he
still won't outdo me!

315
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,019
[KENMA]
Well, he's a good player, and
he's honest,

316
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,456
so I don't mind him. Though
sometimes he can be TOO honest.

317
00:17:30,557 --> 00:17:36,028
[KENMA]
But... that said... he sucks at
passes and some basic stuff...
Even worse than you do.

318
00:17:36,128 --> 00:17:39,932
[KENMA] His serves are way
worse than yours are, too.
[SHOYO] Wait, are you
saying I suck?!

319
00:17:40,032 --> 00:17:43,903
[YAKU] I don't think I've never
known Kenma to be so outgoing as
he is now!
[KENMA] Well, you kinda do.

320
00:17:44,003 --> 00:17:45,705
(KAI nods)
[SHOYO] Hey...

321
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:51,477
[SHOYO]
Lev Haiba... Huh?

322
00:17:51,578 --> 00:17:54,881
He's even got one of those fancy
European names and everything!

323
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:03,255
(SHOYO panicking)
[SHOYO, internal]
Uh‐oh! I‐I should say hi! How do
you say hi in Russian?!

324
00:18:03,355 --> 00:18:06,125
[HAIBA] Ah Karasuno's No.10...
[SHOYO] You don't speak
Russian?!

325
00:18:06,225 --> 00:18:08,528
[HAIBA]
Yeah no sorry, I don't
speak a word of Russian.

326
00:18:08,628 --> 00:18:11,230
Believe it or not, I was
actually born and raised
in Japan.

327
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,032
[SHOYO]
Huh, that's not what I was
expecting.

328
00:18:13,132 --> 00:18:16,435
Anyway my name's Shoyo
Hinata, I'm a first‐year,
how tall are you?

329
00:18:16,536 --> 00:18:22,074
[HAIBA]
Oh my name is Lev Haiba, and I'm
a first‐year too... And uh last
I checked I'm six‐foot‐four.

330
00:18:22,174 --> 00:18:24,076
[SHOYO]
6'4"! I'm jealous!

331
00:18:24,176 --> 00:18:29,148
[HAIBA]
Y'know...You look even tinier
from up close.

332
00:18:29,248 --> 00:18:32,251
[SHOYO]
What was that, why don't you
come down here and say that to
my face! (growl)

333
00:18:32,351 --> 00:18:34,687
[HAIBA]
Oh I'm sorry!
That came out wrong.

334
00:18:34,787 --> 00:18:40,026
But I know that you can jump all
the way up to here if you want
to... I saw you do it during the
game.

335
00:18:41,794 --> 00:18:44,463
[HAIBA]
(chuckle) Of course,
I can jump even higher.

336
00:18:49,936 --> 00:18:53,940
[SHOYO]
(yowl of pain) Ouch!
(whimpering)

337
00:18:55,608 --> 00:19:00,613
[SHOYO]
(shaking pain off) Fine...
I'll just have to get to the
top before you do.

338
00:19:02,882 --> 00:19:04,450
[SHOYO]
Your spikes are great...

339
00:19:04,551 --> 00:19:06,018
It's like it doesn't even
really matter to you

340
00:19:06,118 --> 00:19:07,754
what's blocking your way.

341
00:19:07,854 --> 00:19:11,691
[HAIBA]
Mm‐hm. Well that's because...

342
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:15,027
[HAIBA] I happen to
be the ace of Nekoma.
[SHOYO] Oh?

343
00:19:15,127 --> 00:19:17,864
[HAIBA]
But Yamamoto gets really angry
whenever I mention that though.

344
00:19:17,964 --> 00:19:24,403
[YAMAMOTO]
Whaaat?! How can you be Nekoma's
ace when you can't defend worth
a dried up crap?!

345
00:19:24,504 --> 00:19:27,006
[SHOYO]
But Lev... You play middle
blocker position

346
00:19:27,106 --> 00:19:29,175
so you're part of the
center line, just like I am.

347
00:19:29,275 --> 00:19:32,178
[SHOYO]
I thought to be the ace,
you had to be a wing spiker,

348
00:19:32,278 --> 00:19:34,113
like that mohawk
guy on your team.

349
00:19:34,213 --> 00:19:37,817
[HAIBA]
What does it matter what the
name of the position is?
(SHOYO gasps)

350
00:19:37,917 --> 00:19:44,123
[HAIBA]
To be the ace on the team... All
you have to do is score the most
points... That's all.

351
00:19:45,625 --> 00:19:47,627
[HAIBA]
I'll see you tomorrow Hinata.

352
00:19:47,727 --> 00:19:49,529
[HAIBA]
I look forward to being the
first person

353
00:19:49,629 --> 00:19:51,698
to stop that special
quick attack of yours.

354
00:19:51,798 --> 00:19:53,099
(SHOYO gasp)

355
00:19:57,970 --> 00:20:02,642
[SHOYO]
The guy who scores the
most points is the ace...
That's all..

356
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:05,177
[SHOYO]
Is that really true?

357
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:13,686
(practice)

358
00:20:14,286 --> 00:20:16,022
[SHOYO]
Bring it!

359
00:20:17,156 --> 00:20:19,091
(whistle)
(KURASUNO cheers)

360
00:20:19,191 --> 00:20:22,228
[NAOI]
Seems like Karasuno's more
stable than during Golden Week.

361
00:20:22,328 --> 00:20:25,031
[NAOI]
And the quick‐attack from Number
10 is as sharp as always!

362
00:20:25,131 --> 00:20:31,237
You're right about that;
I'd say they've really started
to gain their footing since we
last met them.

363
00:20:31,337 --> 00:20:34,607
[NEKOMATA, internal]
But are you satisfied with
that, Karasuno?

364
00:20:34,707 --> 00:20:38,177
[NEKOMATA, internal]
This amount of strength wasn't
enough for you to win last time.

365
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:43,449
[NEKOMATA]
And your reason for coming
here... ultimately was to
improve.

366
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:45,317
(long whistle)

367
00:20:45,417 --> 00:20:48,487
Look! They haven't come up
with a countermeasure for
the crazy quick yet,

368
00:20:48,588 --> 00:20:50,322
so try to use it as
much as you can!

369
00:20:50,422 --> 00:20:51,190
[TOBIO]
Right!

370
00:20:51,290 --> 00:20:52,224
[SHOYO]
Okay.

371
00:20:54,393 --> 00:20:55,494
[HITOKA]
You need a towel?

372
00:20:55,595 --> 00:20:56,529
[KEI]
Oh, thanks.

373
00:20:56,629 --> 00:20:58,230
[YAMAMOTO]
Number 4!

374
00:20:59,732 --> 00:21:01,734
[YAMAMOTO] It's up!
Cover for it, Kenma!
[KAI] Left, left!

375
00:21:01,834 --> 00:21:04,737
[HAIBA]
Send it to me Kenma!
Over here now!

376
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,514
(whistle)

377
00:21:14,614 --> 00:21:16,683
[HAIBA]
Yeah!

378
00:21:16,783 --> 00:21:18,818
[YAMAMOTO]
Nice kill, Lev!

379
00:21:18,918 --> 00:21:22,088
[HAIBA]
Sorry I got a little bossy with
you; I just got carried away.

380
00:21:22,188 --> 00:21:25,157
[KENMA]
I've told you a million times,
I don't mind stuff like that...

381
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:28,595
[KENMA]
I'm just shocked you suddenly
asked me for a broad jump setup.

382
00:21:28,695 --> 00:21:31,330
[HAIBA]
Oh, is that what that's
called? Interesting!

383
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:34,934
[TOBIO]
(surprised) So that broad jump
was just out of the blue?

384
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:38,738
[HAIBA]
But hey... we still pulled it
off, right?

385
00:21:38,838 --> 00:21:43,576
[HAIBA]
Well that's because... I happen
to be the ace of Nekoma.

386
00:21:44,276 --> 00:21:46,846
Center ace... Okay...

387
00:21:46,946 --> 00:21:48,948
(long whistle)

388
00:21:49,048 --> 00:21:52,919
[NAOI]
You're next up to serve, Kenma!

389
00:21:53,019 --> 00:21:55,822
[NEKOMATA, internal]
We lost the Inter‐High
preliminaries...

390
00:21:55,922 --> 00:21:59,025
What is it going to take for
us to keep moving forward now?

391
00:21:59,125 --> 00:22:02,328
[NEKOMATA] I'm not sure
if it'll do the trick,
[HAIBA] You can do it, Kenma!
Give us a good serve okay!

392
00:22:02,428 --> 00:22:06,465
[NEKOMATA]
but this new blood flowing
through Nekoma's veins ought
to change things up.

393
00:22:06,566 --> 00:22:11,037
[NEKOMATA, internal]
And what will Karasuno
pursue in order to grow
stronger?

394
00:22:12,639 --> 00:22:14,641
[NEKOMATA]
Stability...

395
00:22:16,175 --> 00:22:17,944
or perhaps...

396
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:21,648
[NEKOMATA]
Evolution?

397
00:23:55,474 --> 00:23:57,677
[KUROO]
Lev is getting pretty used
to everybody now.

398
00:23:57,777 --> 00:24:00,112
[KENMA] Yeah, gradually.
[HAIBA] What? That's not true!

399
00:24:00,212 --> 00:24:02,048
[KUROO]
Oh, you think you still
have a ways to go?

400
00:24:02,148 --> 00:24:04,450
[HAIBA]
No! I'm the ace, so I'm ALREADY
in sync with the team!

401
00:24:04,551 --> 00:24:07,053
[KUROO]
Only thing you're the ace
at is being a numbskull.

402
00:24:07,153 --> 00:24:09,689
[KUROO]
Next Haikyu!! "Greed".
