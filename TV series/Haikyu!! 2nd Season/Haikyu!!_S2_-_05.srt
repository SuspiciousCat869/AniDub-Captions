1
00:00:02,688 --> 00:00:03,823
[DAICHI]
Group up!

2
00:00:03,923 --> 00:00:06,091
[KEISHIN]
Our first game today
is against Nekoma.

3
00:00:06,191 --> 00:00:08,393
How'd we make out yesterday?

4
00:00:08,493 --> 00:00:12,364
[KIYOKO]
Today will be the third set
we've played against Nekoma...

5
00:00:12,464 --> 00:00:18,070
[KIYOKO]
Yesterday, we had two sets
against them and lost them both,
17‐25 and 19‐25.

6
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:21,206
[KEISHIN]
Eh... that just means we haven't
won a set off them yet.

7
00:00:21,306 --> 00:00:26,111
[KEISHIN]
But if we calm down and give it
all we've got, we should be able
to give them a good challenge.

8
00:00:26,211 --> 00:00:29,715
[KEISHIN]
Hey, this is the first Nekoma
game for you two in a long time,
right?

9
00:00:29,815 --> 00:00:31,984
[KEISHIN]
Go out there and rough
'em up a little bit!

10
00:00:32,084 --> 00:00:32,952
[TOBIO & SHOYO]
Right!

11
00:00:33,052 --> 00:00:35,487
(long whistle)

12
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:43,763
[REFEREE]
Okay. Let's get going.

13
00:00:44,897 --> 00:00:46,331
[YAKU]
Serve's up, Fukunaga!

14
00:00:46,431 --> 00:00:48,367
[HAIBA]
I look forward to being
the first person...

15
00:00:48,467 --> 00:00:51,370
to stop that special
quick attack of yours.

16
00:00:53,438 --> 00:00:55,240
[SHOYO]
Bring it on!

17
00:02:29,769 --> 00:02:31,537
(SAEKO snoring)

18
00:02:31,637 --> 00:02:35,107
(SAEKO startled awake)
(hang over moan)

19
00:02:35,207 --> 00:02:40,813
(SAEKO cackles)
[SAEKO] Shouldn't have gone
drinking with the faculty last
night...

20
00:02:41,681 --> 00:02:44,016
[SAEKO, yawning]
What time is it?

21
00:02:44,717 --> 00:02:46,552
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice receive!

22
00:02:48,921 --> 00:02:51,190
(whistle) (KURASUNO cheers)
[HAIBA] That guy is really
incredible!

23
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:53,926
[YAMAMOTO] Nice try, Lev, you
almost had it!
[HAIBA] Thanks!

24
00:02:54,026 --> 00:02:58,698
[ASAHI] Give us another good
one, Tanaka!
[SHINZEN COACH] So Karasuno's
Number 10 does close his eyes

25
00:02:58,798 --> 00:03:03,435
[KAI] Cover, cover!
[YAMAMOTO] Left!
[SHINZEN GM] So it looks like
the essence of that famous quick

26
00:03:03,536 --> 00:03:06,606
[YAKU] Double block!
[SHINZEN GM] is in the setter's
fine‐tuned technique.

27
00:03:07,707 --> 00:03:09,542
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice receive, Captain!

28
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,945
[KENMA]
He jumped from A to C!

29
00:03:14,914 --> 00:03:15,948
(HITOKA gasp)

30
00:03:19,619 --> 00:03:21,687
(whistle) (YAMAMOTO amazed)
[HAIBA] All right!

31
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:24,089
[YAMAMOTO] Well done, my man!
[TAKEDA] Whoa! They stopped him!

32
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:26,491
[TAKEDA]
They just totally shut down that
quick attack!

33
00:03:26,592 --> 00:03:30,195
[KEISHIN]
Nekoma has always been pretty
good at dealing with our famous
quick‐attack.

34
00:03:30,295 --> 00:03:35,901
[KEISHIN]
On top of that, now they've got
a middle blocker who's as fast
as he is tall.

35
00:03:37,336 --> 00:03:39,404
[YAMAMOTO]
Let's go, Kenma!

36
00:03:44,544 --> 00:03:48,981
[TOBIO]
Hey... let's do some more normal
attacks now... you know the
floating ones.

37
00:03:49,815 --> 00:03:51,717
[TOBIO]
Are you listening to me?!

38
00:03:52,217 --> 00:03:53,485
[SHOYO]
Yeah.

39
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:56,956
[KENMA]
Lev.

40
00:03:59,124 --> 00:04:01,460
[KENMA]
I get the feeling that they're
going to start switching

41
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:03,663
things up with a few
normal quick attacks...

42
00:04:03,763 --> 00:04:05,565
[KENMA]
So you should start
read‐blocking.

43
00:04:05,665 --> 00:04:07,567
[HAIBA]
Okay, but what's
read‐blocking again?

44
00:04:07,667 --> 00:04:11,170
[KENMA]
It's when you don't jump until
you see which way the ball is
headed.

45
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,105
[HAIBA]
Oh! Right!

46
00:04:13,205 --> 00:04:15,007
(whistle)
[YAMAMOTO] Here we go!

47
00:04:16,275 --> 00:04:19,478
[YU] Tanaka!
[RYUNOSUKE] Gotcha!

48
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:23,015
[KENMA]
It's when you don't jump until
you see which way the ball is
headed.

49
00:04:26,118 --> 00:04:27,319
(ASAHI & SHOYO shocked)

50
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,854
[HAIBA]
Uh... it's a one touch!

51
00:04:28,954 --> 00:04:31,123
[TADASHI]
I could have sworn
Hinata lured him in!

52
00:04:31,223 --> 00:04:33,893
[KOSHI]
Even a step behind,
his block is so high!

53
00:04:33,993 --> 00:04:35,494
[YAKU]
Chance ball!

54
00:04:37,830 --> 00:04:39,799
[DAICHI, internal]
(frustrated) These guys...!

55
00:04:39,899 --> 00:04:41,901
(NEKOMA cheers)
[TOBIO] Damn...

56
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:43,569
(long whistle)

57
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:45,938
[KEISHIN]
Big deal. So
they're starting off

58
00:04:46,038 --> 00:04:48,207
with their guard up
against our quicks.

59
00:04:48,307 --> 00:04:52,545
While we're playing Nekoma,
I want to focus on using Tanaka
and Asahi to attack left.

60
00:04:52,645 --> 00:04:56,048
[TOBIO] Sure.
[ASAHI] Yessir!
[RYUNOSUKE] All right!

61
00:04:56,148 --> 00:04:59,819
[TAKEDA] The good part is still
yet to come guys!
[KEISHIN, internal] I hope this
is the right way to go. Should I

62
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,454
[TADASHI] Let's all just calm
down and grab a point!
[HITOKA] Here you go.

63
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:06,759
[NEKOMATA, internal]
How do you expect to grow when
you focus primarily on defense?

64
00:05:06,859 --> 00:05:09,161
[HITOKA] Here.
[TOBIO] Thank you. Oh?

65
00:05:09,261 --> 00:05:11,664
[HITOKA]
Asahi.

66
00:05:11,764 --> 00:05:14,366
[SHOYO, internal]
Where is this weird feeling
coming from?

67
00:05:14,466 --> 00:05:21,774
[SHOYO, internal]
Nekoma... Lev... They're such...
powerful opponents.

68
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:24,644
[SHOYO, internal]
I have to get stronger...

69
00:05:24,744 --> 00:05:26,746
[SHOYO, internal]
Or I'll never beat them!

70
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:29,048
(long whistle)

71
00:05:29,148 --> 00:05:30,249
[KAI]
Cover, cover!

72
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:31,617
[YAMAMOTO]
Left!

73
00:05:31,717 --> 00:05:32,918
[YAKU]
Double block!

74
00:05:33,018 --> 00:05:34,086
[YAMAMOTO]
Got it!

75
00:05:35,054 --> 00:05:36,622
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's up! Nice work, buddy!

76
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:37,790
[YU]
Yeah nice cover!

77
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:40,459
[DAICHI]
Got it! Get the last hit!

78
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,227
[DAICHI] Sorry, that was short!
[KOSHI] Asahi!

79
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,095
[TADASHI]
Last touch!

80
00:05:43,195 --> 00:05:44,564
[ASAHI]
Yeah!

81
00:05:45,230 --> 00:05:46,198
(KOSHI gasps)

82
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:47,833
(ASAHI surprised)

83
00:05:52,404 --> 00:05:53,739
(ASAHI gasps)

84
00:05:55,307 --> 00:05:57,209
(SHOYO falls)

85
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,282
[ASAHI]
Ah! O‐Oh no,
I didn't mean to! Huh?

86
00:06:03,382 --> 00:06:06,018
[SHOYO]
(panic) I'm sorry!

87
00:06:06,118 --> 00:06:08,453
[SHOYO]
I was focused on the ball;
I wasn't paying attention!

88
00:06:08,554 --> 00:06:10,489
[SHOYO]
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry! I'm
sorry! (groveling and crying)

89
00:06:10,590 --> 00:06:13,225
[ASAHI] I'm perfectly fine.
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey, watch your
back, dude!

90
00:06:13,325 --> 00:06:16,495
[YU]
You'd better be careful Hinata
or you're gonna get squashed.

91
00:06:16,596 --> 00:06:20,766
[KEISHIN]
Make sure to look around you,
kid! That is why we call
everything out!

92
00:06:20,866 --> 00:06:22,835
[SHOYO] Yeah.. Sorry...
[TOBIO] Hinata! Get it together!

93
00:06:22,935 --> 00:06:26,038
[DAICHI] Now, now.
Take it easy, Kageyama.
[KEISHIN] Hinata probably
doesn't realize,

94
00:06:26,138 --> 00:06:32,244
[KEISHIN]
but just now it seemed like he
was trying to take that ball,
which was intended for the ace.

95
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:37,449
[NEKOMATA, internal]
Is it time for the fledgling
crows to evolve?

96
00:06:37,550 --> 00:06:40,285
[NEKOMATA, internal]
And will that be good or bad for
the team?

97
00:06:40,385 --> 00:06:46,225
[NEKOMATA, internal]
Either way, evolution does not
come to those that do not seek
change.

98
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:50,362
[NEKOMATA, internal]
If you choose to seek it, no
matter if you are the star on
the court,

99
00:06:50,462 --> 00:06:55,735
[NEKOMATA]
or the leader of the team, or
the ace who draws in the final
score...

100
00:06:55,835 --> 00:07:01,541
[NEKOMATA]
You must be greedy, and declare
that you are the one to reach
the summit.

101
00:07:03,909 --> 00:07:05,344
[SHOYO]
You know, Kageyama...

102
00:07:05,444 --> 00:07:06,746
[TOBIO]
Yeah?

103
00:07:06,846 --> 00:07:10,082
[SHOYO]
From now on, for those quick
attacks...

104
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:16,589
[SHOYO]
I'll keep my eyes... wide open.

105
00:07:30,435 --> 00:07:34,273
[SHOYO]
I am done closing my eyes for
the freak quick attack.

106
00:07:34,373 --> 00:07:35,407
(ASAHI & YU alarmed)

107
00:07:35,508 --> 00:07:36,709
(DAICHI & RYUNOSUKE alarmed)

108
00:07:36,809 --> 00:07:38,110
(KEISHIN & TAKEDA concerned)

109
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:39,078
[TOBIO]
Huh?

110
00:07:39,178 --> 00:07:40,513
(SHOYO startled)

111
00:07:40,613 --> 00:07:42,214
[SHOYO]
We can't keep doing this.

112
00:07:42,314 --> 00:07:45,718
[SHOYO]
It obviously isn't working
anymore... so I‐

113
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:49,354
You learned to do the normal
quick attack... because it was
all you could handle.

114
00:07:49,454 --> 00:07:52,658
[TOBIO]
I don't know what you're
thinking about right now,

115
00:07:52,758 --> 00:07:55,360
but we can talk about
it after the game.

116
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:58,764
[TOBIO]
Because if you're saying
you're gonna do that during
this game...

117
00:07:58,864 --> 00:08:01,734
[TOBIO]
I'm not gonna set to someone
I know will miss.

118
00:08:01,834 --> 00:08:04,003
(SHOYO discouraged)

119
00:08:06,038 --> 00:08:07,139
(whistle)

120
00:08:07,239 --> 00:08:08,874
[YAMAMOTO]
Serve's up!

121
00:08:09,542 --> 00:08:11,476
[YU]
Yours, Asahi!

122
00:08:11,577 --> 00:08:13,012
[ASAHI]
Sorry, cover!

123
00:08:13,112 --> 00:08:15,147
[HITOKA, internal]
That was an intense
conversation...

124
00:08:15,247 --> 00:08:18,518
[HITOKA]
It seems like Hinata and
Kageyama just had an argument...

125
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:21,386
[HITOKA]
What do you think it was about?
You heard them right?

126
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:22,955
[KIYOKO]
Mm‐hm.

127
00:08:24,023 --> 00:08:25,625
[HAIBA]
One‐touch! Chance ball!

128
00:08:25,725 --> 00:08:28,027
[KIYOKO]
But it's not just
Hinata and Kageyama...

129
00:08:28,127 --> 00:08:30,563
The moment after
Hinata ran into Asahi...

130
00:08:30,663 --> 00:08:33,132
[KIYOKO]
They all started to get nervous.

131
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,735
[YAMAMOTO]
Get some!

132
00:08:35,835 --> 00:08:39,739
(long whistle)
(NEKOMA celebrate)

133
00:08:42,642 --> 00:08:44,476
[SHOYO]
We can't keep doing this.

134
00:08:44,577 --> 00:08:48,748
[DAICHI, internal]
Hinata finally said what I've
been thinking for awhile now.

135
00:08:51,751 --> 00:08:54,954
[ASAHI, internal]
Alright... We're gonna have
to come up with something
different.

136
00:08:55,054 --> 00:08:56,288
[SHOYO]
All right, I'm going in!

137
00:08:56,388 --> 00:08:58,123
[ASAHI, internal]
At this rate,

138
00:08:58,223 --> 00:08:59,959
Hinata's continued
desire to improve...

139
00:09:00,059 --> 00:09:01,527
[YU]
(laugh) Let me show you
how it's done!

140
00:09:01,627 --> 00:09:03,262
(SHOYO laughing)
[ASAHI] ...could be deadly.

141
00:09:03,362 --> 00:09:05,497
(KEISHIN tense)

142
00:09:05,598 --> 00:09:11,704
(KEISHIN startled)
[NEKOMATA] Seems to me like your
players have had a change in
mindset. (chuckle)

143
00:09:11,804 --> 00:09:15,140
[KEISHIN, internal] It's true
that this is a chance for them
to grow from adversity, but...
[DAICHI] Gather up!

144
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,712
[TAKEDA]
So it's safe to assume you guys
are the weakest of the teams
that are here right now, right?

145
00:09:19,812 --> 00:09:21,146
(KEISHIN shocked)

146
00:09:22,548 --> 00:09:24,850
[RYUNOSUKE, YU, ASAHI, & DAICHI,
internal] He's not wrong, but...

147
00:09:24,950 --> 00:09:30,122
[TAKEDA]
All these other clubs would be
tough opponents if we fought
them in official matches.

148
00:09:30,222 --> 00:09:32,324
[TAKEDA]
Do you see them as
merely enemies...

149
00:09:32,424 --> 00:09:36,662
or do you see them as fellow
competitors from which you can
absorb new techniques?

150
00:09:36,762 --> 00:09:40,900
The fact that you are as weak
as you are means that there is
potential for growth.

151
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:43,603
[TAKEDA]
And... nothing can be more
thrilling than that.

152
00:09:43,703 --> 00:09:44,937
(ALL surprised gasp)

153
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:46,405
[DAICHI]
Thank you, sir!

154
00:09:46,506 --> 00:09:48,407
[ALL]
Thanks!

155
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:52,311
[KEISHIN]
You almost sounded like a wise
old sage just now! Nice job,
Specs!

156
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,314
[TAKEDA]
Well, I am a teacher,
you know...

157
00:09:56,649 --> 00:09:58,117
[KEISHIN]
Huh?

158
00:10:02,087 --> 00:10:03,989
[KOSHI]
We can at least test
it out, right?

159
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:05,958
[KOSHI]
I mean the last time
we played Nekoma,

160
00:10:06,058 --> 00:10:08,861
we managed to pull off the
normal quick attack without
really prepping for it.

161
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:14,166
But back then... we still
had the possibility of
doing the regular quick.

162
00:10:14,266 --> 00:10:17,202
I felt like that was the only
way for us to get through them.

163
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:21,941
[SHOYO]
During the Seijoh match...
I realized it too late.

164
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,408
(KEISHIN, KOSHI, & TOBIO
surprised)

165
00:10:23,509 --> 00:10:25,911
[SHOYO]
By the time I noticed
what was going on,

166
00:10:26,011 --> 00:10:28,514
the ball was on the
floor behind me.

167
00:10:32,217 --> 00:10:33,352
[TOBIO]
Sorry.

168
00:10:34,654 --> 00:10:36,856
[TOBIO]
Oikawa read me like a book.

169
00:10:36,956 --> 00:10:42,528
[SHOYO]
I was the one that lost, so I
don't want you to apologize to
me, Kageyama.

170
00:10:44,263 --> 00:10:48,467
[SHOYO]
'Til the last second... I am
going to fight for myself in the
air!

171
00:10:52,805 --> 00:10:54,640
[TOBIO]
Well during that match...

172
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:58,578
[TOBIO]
I understood how the setter
draws out 100% of the spikers'
skill...

173
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,445
at least to some extent.

174
00:11:00,546 --> 00:11:04,249
(SHOYO heavy breath)
[TOBIO] That quick attack is
your most effective weapon.

175
00:11:04,349 --> 00:11:10,923
[TOBIO]
For that move, missing the right
timing even by the tiniest bit
will kill you out there.

176
00:11:11,023 --> 00:11:15,160
I hear you, I do... but
sorry it's not up to you.

177
00:11:20,432 --> 00:11:25,571
[KOSHI, internal]
Kageyama isn't denying him with
some sort of emotional outburst.
He's just stating facts...

178
00:11:25,671 --> 00:11:30,175
[KOSHI]
I'm sorry, Hinata. But from
listening to what Kageyama had
to say just now...

179
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:34,179
[KOSHI] I think he might
actually have the right idea
this time around y'know.
(SHOYO troubled)

180
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,916
[KOSHI]
That quick‐attack is amazing
enough already.

181
00:11:37,016 --> 00:11:42,822
[KOSHI]
Perfecting the other attacks
with that at the core is
probably our best bet.

182
00:11:42,922 --> 00:11:46,559
[KEISHIN] Yeah... gotta say I'm
with you, Sugawara.
[KOSHI] Oh hey Coach!

183
00:11:46,659 --> 00:11:49,261
[KEISHIN]
Red. You say you want to fight
with your own will,

184
00:11:49,361 --> 00:11:52,097
but that move depends on
a split‐second decision.

185
00:11:52,197 --> 00:11:55,768
Trying to do something in
mid‐air in that brief of an
instant...

186
00:11:55,868 --> 00:11:58,504
that just doesn't seem
very feasible to me.

187
00:11:58,604 --> 00:12:00,305
[SHOYO]
But when I'm doing well,

188
00:12:00,405 --> 00:12:05,545
everything looks like it's
in slow motion... just like
Tanaka said...

189
00:12:05,645 --> 00:12:09,048
[RYUNOSUKE]
I just mean... sometimes I can
see the other team's block in
midair,

190
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:11,183
clear as day, like
it's in slo‐mo.

191
00:12:11,283 --> 00:12:15,154
[RYUNOSUKE]
With a bright ray of light
shining through it.

192
00:12:15,254 --> 00:12:19,625
[KEISHIN]
I guess... there ARE times when
you can see the opponent's block
more clearly.

193
00:12:19,725 --> 00:12:22,762
[SHOYO]
The last point when we had
the practice match against
Seijoh...

194
00:12:22,862 --> 00:12:29,168
[SHOYO]
The Great King, Oikawa...
I saw him. I saw his face.

195
00:12:29,268 --> 00:12:30,970
[SHOYO]
I saw his eyes.

196
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:32,938
[KEISHIN, internal]
He saw... what?

197
00:12:33,038 --> 00:12:35,708
[KEISHIN]
I get it... so you FELT
like you could see?

198
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:41,380
[SHOYO]
The first time I nailed the
quick attack in the 3‐on‐3... I
saw the other side.

199
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:44,083
[SHOYO]
I saw the view from the summit.

200
00:12:44,183 --> 00:12:50,155
[KEISHIN]
Yeah, you're telling me it
SEEMED like you could see all
that stuff. (startled)

201
00:12:53,826 --> 00:12:56,729
(KEISHIN concerned)

202
00:12:56,829 --> 00:12:59,164
[DAICHI] Oh, there you
are! We're about to
start up you guys!
[KEISHIN] Whoa!

203
00:12:59,264 --> 00:13:01,266
[SHOYO]
Okay, we'll be right there.

204
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:06,772
[KEISHIN] Narita.
[KAZUHITO] Yes?

205
00:13:06,872 --> 00:13:08,674
[KEISHIN]
Next set, you're in for Ginger.

206
00:13:08,774 --> 00:13:09,809
[SHOYO] Oh?
[KAZUHITO] Oh.. uh okay.

207
00:13:09,909 --> 00:13:12,277
(TOBIO alarmed)

208
00:13:12,377 --> 00:13:14,379
Alright I think I get what
you're after here kid,

209
00:13:14,479 --> 00:13:17,382
but for now you need to keep
that red head of yours cool.
(SHOYO disappointed)

210
00:13:17,482 --> 00:13:21,386
[KEISHIN]
It's not the right time for us
to start trying things like
that.

211
00:13:21,486 --> 00:13:25,490
[KEISHIN]
And I can't risk anyone
getting hurt in a collision
like earlier.

212
00:13:25,591 --> 00:13:26,626
(SHOYO guilty)

213
00:13:26,726 --> 00:13:29,128
(long whistle)

214
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:32,064
[BOKUTO]
Aww yeah!

215
00:13:32,164 --> 00:13:33,799
[TADASHI] Come on!
[SHOYO] Just shake it off, guys!

216
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,035
[KOSHI] Next, next!
[HAIBA] Bring it on!
[CHIKARA] Tighten it up!

217
00:13:37,202 --> 00:13:39,171
(whistle)
[HAIBA] Right on!

218
00:13:39,271 --> 00:13:40,272
[GOURA]
Shake it off!

219
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:41,874
[YAMAMOTO]
Nice kill, Lev!

220
00:13:41,974 --> 00:13:43,475
[WASHIO]
Got it!

221
00:13:43,576 --> 00:13:44,476
[AKAASHI]
Cover that!

222
00:13:44,577 --> 00:13:45,477
[KOMI]
Serve's up!

223
00:13:45,578 --> 00:13:46,979
[BOKUTO]
Get ready, Saru!

224
00:13:49,715 --> 00:13:51,083
[DAICHI]
Thank you for the games!

225
00:13:51,183 --> 00:13:52,317
[KURASUNO]
Thanks!

226
00:13:52,417 --> 00:13:54,153
[NEKOMATA]
Next time is in two weeks...

227
00:13:54,253 --> 00:13:56,889
It'll be during the
summer training camp.

228
00:13:56,989 --> 00:13:59,158
[KEISHIN & TAKEDA]
We'll see you then, sir!

229
00:13:59,258 --> 00:14:01,426
This is where the
real deal begins.

230
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:05,731
[NEKOMATA]
It'll be the only long‐term
training camp before the Spring
National preliminaries.

231
00:14:05,831 --> 00:14:11,303
[TAKEDA] Yes.
[NEKOMATA] I'll have you little
young'uns out drinking with me
every night for the entire week.

232
00:14:11,403 --> 00:14:13,939
[TAKEDA] Sure!
(KEISHIN defeated grumble)

233
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,675
[KUROO]
I know this is a bit late...

234
00:14:15,775 --> 00:14:18,277
[KUROO]
but I can't help but notice you
kept your third‐years too.

235
00:14:18,377 --> 00:14:21,180
[DAICHI]
Yeah. You played last year's
champs on day 2

236
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,083
of the Inter‐High prelims,
right? Hinata told us.

237
00:14:24,183 --> 00:14:25,818
[DAICHI]
That's some rotten luck.

238
00:14:25,918 --> 00:14:28,120
[KUROO]
Yeah... lost the quarter finals.

239
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:30,523
[DAICHI]
Top 8 in Tokyo's nothing to
sneeze at though.

240
00:14:30,623 --> 00:14:32,625
[KUROO]
Who cares if we
can't keep going.

241
00:14:32,725 --> 00:14:34,426
[DAICHI]
(agreeing) True...

242
00:14:34,527 --> 00:14:35,828
[SHOYO]
Oh?

243
00:14:35,928 --> 00:14:37,597
[HAIBA]
See ya later, Hinata!

244
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:39,364
[HAIBA]
Can't wait to beat
you next time too.

245
00:14:39,464 --> 00:14:41,266
[SHOYO]
Keep dreaming, pal!

246
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:45,137
I'll show you five‐three's
a million times better than
six‐four!

247
00:14:48,107 --> 00:14:49,675
[HAIBA]
...Take it easy.

248
00:14:50,209 --> 00:14:52,678
(vehicle starting)

249
00:15:01,453 --> 00:15:04,690
[TAKEDA]
At the end of the day, I think
this camp was a success for us.

250
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:07,927
[TAKEDA]
Turns out there's a lot of
things we can work on, isn't
there?

251
00:15:08,027 --> 00:15:12,665
[KEISHIN]
Well, one thing's for sure,
after all that's happened, we'll
have our work cut out for us.

252
00:15:12,765 --> 00:15:16,669
[TAKEDA]
That's true... We can think
about all that out when we get
back home.

253
00:15:16,769 --> 00:15:19,071
[KEISHIN] Back home, huh...
[TAKEDA] Uh... Coach?

254
00:15:19,171 --> 00:15:23,943
[KEISHIN]
I just remembered I've got a
relative coming home soon that
can be quite a handful.

255
00:15:24,043 --> 00:15:25,645
[TAKEDA]
Hmmm?

256
00:15:27,446 --> 00:15:30,082
[TAKEDA]
Thanks for all the hard work you
put in on the trip, guys.

257
00:15:30,182 --> 00:15:31,684
[ALL]
Sir!

258
00:15:31,784 --> 00:15:33,452
[TAKEDA]
And tomorrow, like I told you
before,

259
00:15:33,553 --> 00:15:35,721
[TAKEDA]
there'll be an inspection going
on in the gym,

260
00:15:35,821 --> 00:15:37,823
so we're not having practice.

261
00:15:37,923 --> 00:15:44,129
So take it easy and get some
rest, since you guys haven't had
any downtime lately. (chuckle)

262
00:15:45,197 --> 00:15:46,065
[SHOYO]
Kageyama.

263
00:15:46,165 --> 00:15:47,567
[TOBIO]
Huh?

264
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,670
Hey... come set for me.

265
00:15:55,274 --> 00:15:57,743
[HITOKA]
Oh, hey... You guys
aren't going home yet?

266
00:15:57,843 --> 00:16:01,080
[SHOYO]
Actually, would you mind
throwing a few balls for us
before you go, Yachi?

267
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:02,982
[HITOKA]
(startled) I can do that?

268
00:16:03,082 --> 00:16:06,318
[SHOYO]
Sure, all you have to do is
throw curveballs over Kageyama's
head.

269
00:16:06,418 --> 00:16:08,888
[HITOKA]
O‐Oh... I'll try!

270
00:16:08,988 --> 00:16:12,792
[SHOYO]
(exhale) I'm ready!

271
00:16:13,893 --> 00:16:15,127
[HITOKA]
Okay.

272
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:27,139
[TOBIO, internal]
His attention is on the ball,
so this isn't his maximum
jump...!

273
00:16:27,239 --> 00:16:28,841
[SHOYO]
Send me up another one!

274
00:16:28,941 --> 00:16:30,375
(TOBIO annoyed)

275
00:16:44,790 --> 00:16:48,661
(SHOYO missing the ball)

276
00:16:50,029 --> 00:16:52,932
(SHOYO out of breath)

277
00:16:53,032 --> 00:16:54,834
[SHOYO]
(grunt) One more!

278
00:16:56,936 --> 00:17:00,172
[TOBIO]
(grunt) Instead of repeating
this attack that we may not be
able to do...

279
00:17:00,272 --> 00:17:04,343
[TOBIO]
why can't we practice blocking
or serving or any of the other
ten thousand things

280
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:06,045
[TOBIO]
we need to get better
at right now?!

281
00:17:06,145 --> 00:17:08,180
[SHOYO]
(out of breath) But...

282
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:11,083
if this quick attack
doesn't work out...

283
00:17:11,183 --> 00:17:13,753
[SHOYO]
I have no reason to be standing
on the court! (heavy breathing)

284
00:17:13,853 --> 00:17:17,122
[TOBIO]
I already told you, Hinata,
this isn't about how
badly you want to do it!

285
00:17:17,222 --> 00:17:19,992
[TOBIO]
(annoyed) I'll set a ball that
won't get stopped by their
blockers!

286
00:17:20,092 --> 00:17:23,128
[SHOYO]
You can, but how is that
supposed to make me any better?!

287
00:17:23,228 --> 00:17:27,633
(HITOKA concerned)
[TOBIO] The first round of
prelims for Spring Nationals
is only a month away.

288
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,769
Now you tell me which
is more useful:

289
00:17:29,869 --> 00:17:31,604
[TOBIO]
...you want a perfected
quick attack,

290
00:17:31,704 --> 00:17:34,807
or a completely useless
quick attack?! HUH?! (seething)

291
00:17:34,907 --> 00:17:36,609
[HITOKA]
Um Please take it
easy, you guys!

292
00:17:36,709 --> 00:17:38,878
[HITOKA]
Let's just calm down and
take a step back, okay?

293
00:17:38,978 --> 00:17:41,747
[TOBIO, internal]
Dammit! I know what
I'm saying is right...

294
00:17:41,847 --> 00:17:44,016
[TOBIO, internal]
So why does he refuse to back
down?

295
00:17:44,116 --> 00:17:49,121
[SHOYO]
(fuming) I told you... I want to
be able to fight on my own!

296
00:17:49,221 --> 00:17:54,760
[TOBIO]
(seething) And I'm telling YOU
that your selfish attitude is
tearing this team apart!

297
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:57,897
[HITOKA]
(gasp) Come on, guys...

298
00:17:57,997 --> 00:17:59,431
(SHOYO & TOBIO angry)

299
00:17:59,532 --> 00:18:02,334
[HITOKA]
L‐Let's all get along... okay?

300
00:18:02,434 --> 00:18:05,404
[TOBIO]
I'll set to whoever
I have to to win.

301
00:18:08,073 --> 00:18:12,177
[TOBIO]
It's just... I highly doubt that
person is going to be you.

302
00:18:12,277 --> 00:18:15,815
[TOBIO]
And that still hasn't
changed, you know.

303
00:18:15,915 --> 00:18:22,321
[SHOYO]
(seething) KAAAGEEEYAAAAMAAAAAA!
(frustrated yelling)

304
00:18:22,421 --> 00:18:23,589
(TOBIO shocked)

305
00:18:24,423 --> 00:18:25,791
[TOBIO]
Dammit! Let me go!

306
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:27,527
Then throw me a damn set!

307
00:18:27,627 --> 00:18:30,696
Do you hear me?! (struggles
to hold on) (tossed on floor)

308
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:32,632
(TOBIO shock) (snarling while
tossing Shoyo on floor)

309
00:18:32,732 --> 00:18:35,300
[HITOKA] (gasp)
Someone! Tanaka...!
[TOBIO] Stoppit! (struggling)

310
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:39,071
[SHOYO]
They stopped the quick attack!
Today, and back during the
Seijoh match!

311
00:18:39,171 --> 00:18:42,708
[TOBIO]
(struggling) Oh yeah?! What, are
you trying to say my set was bad
asshole?!

312
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:47,446
[SHOYO]
No! That's not what I mean! It
was perfect! It was spot‐on! But
they still stopped it!

313
00:18:47,547 --> 00:18:49,481
[TOBIO]
(struggling) Well maybe that was
your fault, you ever think of
that?

314
00:18:49,582 --> 00:18:51,116
[SHOYO]
If I stay the way I am,

315
00:18:51,216 --> 00:18:53,485
I can't hold my ground
against the top teams!

316
00:18:53,586 --> 00:18:57,990
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey! Both of you guys!
Stop iiiiit!

317
00:19:11,804 --> 00:19:15,407
Um my bus stop... It's right
over there, this'll be far
enough...

318
00:19:15,508 --> 00:19:17,342
Um... thanks for walking me...

319
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:19,044
[SHOYO]
I'm really sorry about that.

320
00:19:19,144 --> 00:19:21,847
[HITOKA]
No, it's not a problem at all!

321
00:19:21,947 --> 00:19:25,450
It's alright...
No need to worry about me.

322
00:19:27,386 --> 00:19:30,155
[HITOKA]
Hinata...

323
00:19:30,255 --> 00:19:33,225
[SHOYO]
In my first and last tournament
back in middle school,

324
00:19:33,325 --> 00:19:35,427
Kageyama kicked my butt.

325
00:19:35,528 --> 00:19:40,800
[SHOYO]
I swore revenge. But instead,
when I entered high school, we
ended up on the same team.

326
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:45,004
[SHOYO]
He was a lot meaner than I
expected, so it was kinda hard
at first.

327
00:19:45,104 --> 00:19:48,373
[SHOYO]
But come game time, I began
to know what he was thinking...

328
00:19:48,473 --> 00:19:56,248
[SHOYO]
And for the first time, I felt
that instead of just a partner,
I had.. a friend.

329
00:19:56,348 --> 00:19:57,850
(HITOKA tearing up)

330
00:19:58,951 --> 00:19:59,952
[SHOYO]
See you later.

331
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:04,023
[HITOKA]
Yeah... (sniffling)

332
00:20:13,633 --> 00:20:16,168
(school bell ringing)

333
00:20:16,268 --> 00:20:19,739
[ASAHI]
So are you telling me that
Hinata and Kageyama actually
came to blows?

334
00:20:19,839 --> 00:20:23,976
[KOSHI]
Things've been tense between
those two ever since the trip to
Tokyo. It's not good.

335
00:20:24,076 --> 00:20:28,113
[RYUNOSUKE]
With the Spring National prelims
coming up, this is bad news for
all of us

336
00:20:28,213 --> 00:20:33,819
[DAICHI]
Yeah but... those two bickering
with each other isn't exactly
outside of the norm.

337
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,688
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah and come to think of it...

338
00:20:35,788 --> 00:20:38,057
they were at each other's
throats before they even,
joined us.

339
00:20:38,157 --> 00:20:39,859
[ASAHI]
Wait, are you serious?

340
00:20:39,959 --> 00:20:42,427
[KOSHI]
On the first day, they knocked
off the vice principal's toupee,

341
00:20:42,528 --> 00:20:45,965
[KOSHI]
and then Daichi locked them out
of the gym. It wasn't pretty...

342
00:20:46,065 --> 00:20:48,701
[RYUNOSUKE]
Well, those two knuckleheads
have come this far;

343
00:20:48,801 --> 00:20:51,003
maybe it's just another hurdle
for them to get over.

344
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:56,942
Yeah... maybe so. But y'know
what... Let's not give up on
those two knuckleheads yet.

345
00:20:58,210 --> 00:20:59,512
[KEISHIN]
Thank you. (sigh)

346
00:21:05,585 --> 00:21:07,553
[KEISHIN, internal]
That freak quick was already
amazing.

347
00:21:07,653 --> 00:21:11,791
[KEISHIN, internal]
It should be fundamentally
impossible to make it even
better.

348
00:21:12,558 --> 00:21:14,627
[SHOYO]
I saw the other side.

349
00:21:14,727 --> 00:21:17,429
[SHOYO]
I saw the view from the summit.

350
00:21:17,530 --> 00:21:19,464
[KEISHIN]
Those eyes...

351
00:21:19,565 --> 00:21:22,602
[KEISHIN]
The amount of time you're at the
peak of your jump is only but an
instant.

352
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:27,472
[KEISHIN]
Even if you say you can see the
blockers, it's just a vague
recognition that they're there.

353
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:32,177
[KEISHIN]
But once in a blue moon, there's
a spiker who can actually see
blockers clearly,

354
00:21:32,277 --> 00:21:38,083
[KEISHIN]
right down to their fingertips.
Even the positions of the
players behind them.

355
00:21:38,183 --> 00:21:41,654
[KEISHIN, internal]
Could Hinata be one of those
spikers?

356
00:21:43,422 --> 00:21:46,258
[KEISHIN]
A quick attack dished out from a
miraculous setup...

357
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:50,663
[KEISHIN]
If Hinata could dictate where it
goes with his own will from
mid‐air...

358
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,971
[KEISHIN, internal]
No, that's impossible!
Nobody would be able to pull
that off!

359
00:21:59,071 --> 00:22:12,451
But wait... if it could be done,
then we would have a new ruler
of aerial combat, surpassing
even the Tiny Giant.

360
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:15,588
(door opening)

361
00:22:15,688 --> 00:22:20,292
[KEISHIN]
Welcome to‐ oh... Sup, lil' Red?

362
00:22:20,392 --> 00:22:24,930
Hey Coach... I want you to tell
me how I should be practicing.

363
00:23:55,821 --> 00:23:57,557
[KOSHI]
Hinata and Kageyama are
fighting...

364
00:23:57,657 --> 00:23:59,625
[ASAHI]
Ah, the struggles of youth.

365
00:23:59,725 --> 00:24:01,594
[KOSHI]
You look out of place saying
that, Asahi.

366
00:24:01,694 --> 00:24:03,963
[ASAHI]
Huh?! What's that
supposed to mean?!

367
00:24:04,063 --> 00:24:06,899
[KOSHI] Well, you don't look
very youthful, that's for sure.
[ASAHI] Hey!

368
00:24:06,999 --> 00:24:09,168
[KOSHI]
Next Haikyu!! ‐ "Tempo".
