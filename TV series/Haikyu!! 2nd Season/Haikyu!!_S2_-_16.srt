1
00:00:07,555 --> 00:00:09,723
[Terushima]:
It's up! Nice!

2
00:00:09,823 --> 00:00:11,158
It's a feint!

3
00:00:18,031 --> 00:00:20,233
[Terushima]:
All you!

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,970
Again? This time,
I'll make sure to stop it

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,172
with something
other than my face!

6
00:00:28,842 --> 00:00:30,277
A back‐court attack!

7
00:00:30,377 --> 00:00:31,812
A break
point, huh?

8
00:00:31,912 --> 00:00:33,313
That scared the
crap out of me;

9
00:00:33,413 --> 00:00:36,316
I totally thought
you were gonna hit it!

10
00:00:36,416 --> 00:00:38,619
His teammates weren't
expecting it either.

11
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:40,688
Yeah, I know, but he
hit it pretty calmly.

12
00:00:40,788 --> 00:00:42,956
Better be on our toes...
gotta watch him.

13
00:00:43,056 --> 00:00:44,424
Johzenji's not bad...

14
00:00:44,525 --> 00:00:47,194
They've been doing well
since the timeout.

15
00:00:47,294 --> 00:00:48,361
Yeah...

16
00:00:48,461 --> 00:00:50,430
They're making sure to
observe their opponents.

17
00:00:50,531 --> 00:00:54,034
[Keishin]:
They're planning ahead.
This could be trouble.

18
00:02:27,728 --> 00:02:30,731
[Misaki]:
I'm not saying you
guys need to take
it slow and steady.

19
00:02:30,831 --> 00:02:32,199
You guys may
look like idiots,

20
00:02:32,299 --> 00:02:34,301
but you're not
really idiots, right?

21
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:35,669
Right!

22
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:38,005
I know it's fun. But having
a good time doesn't mean

23
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:39,573
you shouldn't
be thinking.

24
00:02:43,577 --> 00:02:45,112
[Futamata]:
Left, left!

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:48,048
[Tsuchiyu]:
Nice!

26
00:02:48,148 --> 00:02:49,817
[Bobata]:
It's up! Last hit!

27
00:02:49,917 --> 00:02:51,519
[Keishin]:
If it's too close to call

28
00:02:51,619 --> 00:02:53,353
whether or not they'll make
a shot, don't block it,

29
00:02:53,453 --> 00:02:54,555
just pull back.

30
00:02:56,123 --> 00:02:58,458
That was great!

31
00:02:58,559 --> 00:03:01,662
If you can stop it,
I have no complaints!

32
00:03:01,762 --> 00:03:04,765
Yeah, being able to make
the moves you want to make,

33
00:03:04,865 --> 00:03:06,299
and having the
skill to execute,

34
00:03:06,399 --> 00:03:08,669
is when you can
truly play freely.

35
00:03:08,769 --> 00:03:11,705
And as you'd might expect, the
further you go, the more players

36
00:03:11,805 --> 00:03:14,675
Have both of
those abilities.

37
00:03:14,775 --> 00:03:16,610
It's all you,
Tsukishima!

38
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:19,479
[Futamata]:
Here he comes,
Number 10!

39
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,749
Hey... listen up!

40
00:03:21,849 --> 00:03:24,985
Johzenji hasn't been able to
stop Hinata's quick attacks

41
00:03:25,085 --> 00:03:28,622
yet... Take it
right here, you guys.

42
00:03:28,722 --> 00:03:29,957
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive!

43
00:03:30,057 --> 00:03:32,793
Number 10 jumped out!
Here it comes.

44
00:03:32,893 --> 00:03:34,528
Hey... wait a sec...

45
00:03:34,628 --> 00:03:37,230
[Spectator 1]:
Johzenji's blockers are
leaving Number 10 open?!

46
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:39,299
I guess we don't have
much of a choice.

47
00:03:39,399 --> 00:03:41,101
If we can't block it...
we're better off

48
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,403
sending everyone
to receive.

49
00:03:50,077 --> 00:03:52,245
Whoa, they actually
made that work!

50
00:03:52,345 --> 00:03:53,981
After they left
Number 10 all alone,

51
00:03:54,081 --> 00:03:55,916
they were able
to counterattack!

52
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:57,518
Yeah, that was sick!

53
00:03:57,618 --> 00:03:59,019
I know it's fun.

54
00:03:59,119 --> 00:04:01,855
But having a good time doesn't
mean you shouldn't be thinking.

55
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:04,357
I sure do love it when the
simulations in my head play out

56
00:04:04,457 --> 00:04:08,428
in real life!
It's workin' now!

57
00:04:08,529 --> 00:04:10,397
[Takinoue]:
A two‐point game, huh...?

58
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:13,066
Aoba‐Johsai went with
this kind of counterattack

59
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,268
against us, too...

60
00:04:15,368 --> 00:04:18,506
Hinata's spikes are
still pretty light.

61
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:23,276
[Shoyo]:
I hate being blocked, but why
is it that I get even more

62
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:26,413
pissed off when the
blockers just ignore me?!

63
00:04:26,514 --> 00:04:30,784
Kageyama! I got a plan!
I want the next one...

64
00:04:32,152 --> 00:04:34,421
[Terushima]:
Let's get one more!
Serve's up!

65
00:04:35,022 --> 00:04:36,323
Got it!

66
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,563
[Shoyo]:
I can see it.

67
00:04:44,832 --> 00:04:46,700
You serious?!

68
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,068
Nice kill!

69
00:04:48,168 --> 00:04:49,302
They're quite a bit
different than they were

70
00:04:49,402 --> 00:04:51,204
back in the
Seijoh match.

71
00:04:51,304 --> 00:04:53,807
[Ryunosuke]:
Hinata! Give 'em
another one!

72
00:04:58,912 --> 00:05:00,814
A received that
from so close!

73
00:05:00,914 --> 00:05:02,716
If we can touch it...

74
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:05,653
Then it's all ours!
Let's go!

75
00:05:09,022 --> 00:05:11,625
If we're hitting the ball
to an open area on the court,

76
00:05:11,725 --> 00:05:15,295
they're going for a one‐touch
instead of a receive.

77
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:17,698
It's mine next time!

78
00:05:17,798 --> 00:05:21,468
Hinata, you know you haven't
used it yet today, right?

79
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:24,672
You know, your
new special attack.

80
00:05:26,473 --> 00:05:27,474
[Daichi]:
Nice receive!

81
00:05:27,575 --> 00:05:29,209
[Ryunosuke]:
Do it, Hinata!

82
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:32,412
Lets goooo!

83
00:05:40,888 --> 00:05:42,556
[Hitoka]:
Match point!

84
00:05:42,656 --> 00:05:45,058
[Terushima]:
Alright, here we go fellas.

85
00:05:45,158 --> 00:05:47,661
It's time to get serious.

86
00:05:49,296 --> 00:05:50,598
[Tsuchiyu]:
Got it!

87
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,737
A‐another synchronized
attack?!

88
00:05:56,837 --> 00:06:00,841
[Misaki]:
They're not considering the
possibility of failure at all.

89
00:06:02,409 --> 00:06:06,213
All they think about...
is the joy of success.

90
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:10,684
Heads up, you guys!
Now they're changing it up!

91
00:06:25,098 --> 00:06:27,568
YEAH!

92
00:06:27,668 --> 00:06:29,102
Oh, yeah!

93
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,539
They just made it
to the top 8!

94
00:06:32,272 --> 00:06:35,142
We got as far
as we could...

95
00:06:35,242 --> 00:06:36,810
[Terushima]:
This is it?!

96
00:06:36,910 --> 00:06:41,348
Dammit... and I was finally just
starting to get into it!

97
00:06:41,448 --> 00:06:44,184
He looks like he could
still keep going, doesn't he?

98
00:06:44,284 --> 00:06:46,186
Freakin' me out.

99
00:06:47,354 --> 00:06:50,290
[Anabara]:
You did a great job.

100
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,926
I didn't see
it at first, but...

101
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:54,795
you knew them
far better than I did.

102
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:58,065
It's because of you they
didn't completely collapse.

103
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:00,433
[Anabara]:
I want to
thank you for that.

104
00:07:01,034 --> 00:07:03,236
It's nothing...

105
00:07:03,336 --> 00:07:05,706
[Team Johzenji/ Team Karasuno]:
Thank you for the game!

106
00:07:05,806 --> 00:07:08,942
So it's not just my
imagination, is it?

107
00:07:09,042 --> 00:07:12,713
[Futakuchi]:
I'd say their quick attack
has definitely evolved.

108
00:07:17,818 --> 00:07:21,855
Alright then, Aone, we'll go on
ahead... Don't be too long.

109
00:07:25,693 --> 00:07:27,194
Okay, boys...

110
00:07:27,294 --> 00:07:29,062
I know you can get
excited out there...

111
00:07:29,162 --> 00:07:31,632
but don't get
out of control.

112
00:07:31,732 --> 00:07:33,567
[Anabara]:
The only reason you got
as far as you did, is because

113
00:07:33,667 --> 00:07:37,404
Misaki was here to
smack you in the tushies.

114
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:41,408
Anyway, I'm proud of you.
They're all yours.

115
00:07:44,044 --> 00:07:47,180
U‐um... okay so...

116
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,084
[Misaki]:
You guys, make sure you don't
give Runa too much trouble.

117
00:07:51,184 --> 00:07:53,086
She's just a first‐year, y'know.

118
00:07:53,186 --> 00:07:55,656
I'll still be keeping
an eye you.

119
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,730
And... that more serious play
style you were just doing...

120
00:08:02,830 --> 00:08:03,931
Well... um..

121
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:06,299
I think it's a good thing.

122
00:08:10,403 --> 00:08:13,507
Let's go guys. The next
team's already here.

123
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:19,580
[Terushima]:
Uh... thank you...
for everything!

124
00:08:57,217 --> 00:08:58,719
You guys did it!

125
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:00,053
Woo!

126
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:01,021
Woo!

127
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:03,857
Uh, woooo?!

128
00:09:03,957 --> 00:09:06,193
Okay, you guys... she
doesn't have enough hands

129
00:09:06,293 --> 00:09:07,861
for all your high fiving.

130
00:09:07,961 --> 00:09:09,530
Uh... right...

131
00:09:10,097 --> 00:09:11,131
Woo!

132
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:12,700
Woo!

133
00:09:19,773 --> 00:09:22,776
Tomorrow, I
will stop you.

134
00:09:26,046 --> 00:09:27,548
I'm beating you!

135
00:09:40,728 --> 00:09:41,829
Shut up!

136
00:09:41,929 --> 00:09:44,331
Was he waiting here just
to tell Hinata that...?

137
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,933
(whistle blowing)

138
00:09:46,033 --> 00:09:47,935
[Shoyo]:
Is the game on
court B over?

139
00:09:48,035 --> 00:09:51,438
[Tobio]:
If so, the winner is
our next opponent.

140
00:09:58,045 --> 00:10:01,048
[Masayoshi]:
Way to go, way to go, Ta‐ke‐ru!

141
00:10:01,148 --> 00:10:07,287
Way to go, way to go, Takeru!
Way to go, yeaah!

142
00:10:07,387 --> 00:10:09,990
YEAAAAAH!

143
00:10:10,090 --> 00:10:12,893
His whole family is here
to cheer him on...

144
00:10:12,993 --> 00:10:16,063
Before the prelims, that's
the school Coach was saying

145
00:10:16,163 --> 00:10:17,765
to be careful of.

146
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:20,568
So if we wanna play
Date Tech...

147
00:10:20,668 --> 00:10:23,003
we gotta get
through THEM first!

148
00:10:41,522 --> 00:10:45,158
[Takeda]:
Everyone! You've all worked
VERY hard here on day one!

149
00:10:45,258 --> 00:10:46,527
[Team Karasuno]:
Thank you!

150
00:10:46,627 --> 00:10:48,161
Wakutani South,
our next opponent,

151
00:10:48,261 --> 00:10:50,731
is not like any other team
we've played before.

152
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,633
They have their
third‐years like us.

153
00:10:52,733 --> 00:10:54,902
They're an extremely
polished team.

154
00:10:55,002 --> 00:10:59,006
[Keishin]:
They've got Nekoma's defense and
tenacity, and more experience.

155
00:10:59,106 --> 00:11:01,308
Even if your attacks
aren't landing at first,

156
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,110
don't get
frustrated, alright?

157
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:07,548
Yes, I'm looking at you two,
you little psycho meat‐heads.

158
00:11:07,648 --> 00:11:11,919
It'll be just fine...
We've got their backs, okay?

159
00:11:12,019 --> 00:11:14,187
[Daichi/Yu]:
We're counting on you guys!

160
00:11:14,287 --> 00:11:16,524
[Keishin]:
Well, look at that... he makes
it sound better when he says it.

161
00:11:16,624 --> 00:11:17,891
Alright...

162
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:20,661
Our job is to
survive tomorrow.

163
00:11:25,298 --> 00:11:27,400
[Daichi]:
Karasuno, fight!

164
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,737
[Team Karasuno]:
Fiiight!

165
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:48,656
Gooo... Fiiiight... Ta‐ke‐ru!

166
00:11:48,756 --> 00:11:53,126
Go Go, Takeru!
Win, win, Takeru! YEAHHHHH!

167
00:11:53,226 --> 00:11:56,730
There's more today than
yesterday. His whole family!

168
00:11:56,830 --> 00:12:00,534
So is it just me,
or do you seem jealous?

169
00:12:00,634 --> 00:12:02,903
Come on, you guys,
concentrate!

170
00:12:03,003 --> 00:12:05,438
Uh, hey Coach...
is something wrong?

171
00:12:05,539 --> 00:12:07,708
We need to get ourselves
more pumped up...

172
00:12:07,808 --> 00:12:11,011
Maybe just it's my coach's
intuition talkin'...

173
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:13,981
But these Wakutani
South guys...

174
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:16,316
[Keishin]:
They might be a
tough match for us.

175
00:12:16,416 --> 00:12:18,051
[Referee]:
Captains.

176
00:12:19,186 --> 00:12:20,921
Let's have a good game.

177
00:12:22,623 --> 00:12:24,858
We won't let
our guard down.

178
00:12:26,326 --> 00:12:27,995
That's flattering.

179
00:12:29,530 --> 00:12:30,898
[Shimada]:
Hey.

180
00:12:30,998 --> 00:12:34,902
Oh, Shimada. Hello there!
Are you by yourself?

181
00:12:35,002 --> 00:12:37,170
Yeah, Takinoue
has work today.

182
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:40,040
But he did say he might be able
to swing by in the afternoon,

183
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,676
[Saeko]:
Man, I am freaking
out here!

184
00:12:42,776 --> 00:12:45,913
Stuff like this really
gets my panties in a twist!

185
00:12:46,013 --> 00:12:47,447
H‐hello!

186
00:12:47,548 --> 00:12:49,917
She looks...
kinda... familiar

187
00:12:50,017 --> 00:12:52,786
So I guess you two have been
taking care of my little Ryu

188
00:12:52,886 --> 00:12:55,355
for me... I'm Saeko,
his big sister.

189
00:12:55,455 --> 00:12:57,591
Tanaka's big sister!
Guess I see it...

190
00:12:57,691 --> 00:13:00,360
Ryu! Tanaka! Yoo‐hoo!

191
00:13:00,460 --> 00:13:02,596
Oh? Big Sister!

192
00:13:02,696 --> 00:13:04,698
[Saeko]:
I love you,
you big dummy!

193
00:13:04,798 --> 00:13:07,935
I'm here to make sure you
don't screw this up!

194
00:13:11,404 --> 00:13:13,440
[Team WakuNan/Team Karasuno]:
Let's have a good game!

195
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:14,842
Take 'em down!

196
00:13:14,942 --> 00:13:18,145
Now, Day two. You gotta
take care of business!

197
00:13:18,245 --> 00:13:19,880
Bring it on!

198
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,882
[Nakashima]:
Give it a good serve!

199
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,685
Got it!

200
00:13:24,785 --> 00:13:26,754
All right, start off
with a quick attack

201
00:13:26,854 --> 00:13:28,756
[Shimada]:
and give 'em
a good scare!

202
00:13:32,392 --> 00:13:34,094
Oh, yeah!

203
00:13:34,194 --> 00:13:36,063
Nice kill, Hinata!

204
00:13:37,565 --> 00:13:39,066
What the hell
was that just now?!

205
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:42,269
A quick attack, huh?
Was that a fluke?

206
00:13:42,369 --> 00:13:45,573
[Nakashima]:
All right, listen up!
We'll cut the next one quick!

207
00:13:45,673 --> 00:13:46,439
Yeah!

208
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,641
Y‐yeah!

209
00:13:47,741 --> 00:13:49,109
Y'see that?

210
00:13:49,209 --> 00:13:52,045
WakuNan doesn't seem surprised
by that quick attack...

211
00:13:52,145 --> 00:13:54,414
[Nakashima]:
Nobody calls the
current Karasuno

212
00:13:54,515 --> 00:13:56,850
"The Clipped Crows" anymore.

213
00:13:56,950 --> 00:13:59,853
The most surprising team
in the entire prefecture...

214
00:13:59,953 --> 00:14:03,757
We're super lucky to be able
to go against them!

215
00:14:03,857 --> 00:14:05,926
Looks like they got together
before the game

216
00:14:06,026 --> 00:14:08,328
and figured out
how to work against Hinata.

217
00:14:08,428 --> 00:14:10,564
They're not showing
any signs of being flustered.

218
00:14:10,664 --> 00:14:13,500
[Takeda]:
They're not having
a bad matchup against us...

219
00:14:13,601 --> 00:14:16,904
they're the type of team that we
struggle against, aren't they?

220
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:20,207
Yeah. Based on how things
have been so far,

221
00:14:20,307 --> 00:14:22,910
we've always dealt better with
teams that aggressively attack

222
00:14:23,010 --> 00:14:24,645
with their prominent weapons.

223
00:14:24,745 --> 00:14:27,447
But team that keeps
its pace remains silent

224
00:14:27,548 --> 00:14:29,282
and monitors what we do

225
00:14:29,382 --> 00:14:31,619
That's the team we're
gonna struggle against.

226
00:14:31,719 --> 00:14:33,186
They can cause us fits.

227
00:14:33,286 --> 00:14:36,123
Seijoh and Nekoma are
perfect examples of that.

228
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:37,390
I see...

229
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:39,593
So we're up against a team
that has prepared themselves

230
00:14:39,693 --> 00:14:41,562
for our quick attacks.

231
00:14:41,662 --> 00:14:43,697
Now, what are we gonna do?

232
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:47,601
Hey, Hinata, you do know
a powerhouse school

233
00:14:47,701 --> 00:14:50,538
may be keeping an eye
on you don'cha?

234
00:14:50,638 --> 00:14:53,641
It's true... they're studying
you and all your moves, too.

235
00:14:53,741 --> 00:15:00,047
[Daichi (echoing)]:
You and all your moves, too...
You and all your moves, too...

236
00:15:02,850 --> 00:15:05,252
[Hinata]:
A powerhouse is studying ME!

237
00:15:05,352 --> 00:15:09,422
[Daichi]:
Man, he's totally
upstaging us!

238
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:16,564
It doesn't matter, 'cause
I'm going to surpass myself!

239
00:15:16,664 --> 00:15:19,800
Hey, if you keep on
only watching Hinata,

240
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,602
you're askin' for it!

241
00:15:21,702 --> 00:15:23,370
Just like a
captain should,

242
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,540
he knows what buttons to push to
get his players all revved up.

243
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,776
[Asahi]:
Serve it up, Kageyama!

244
00:15:33,681 --> 00:15:35,082
That felt good!

245
00:15:38,085 --> 00:15:38,919
So strong!

246
00:15:39,019 --> 00:15:40,954
[Kawatabi]:
Nice receive!

247
00:15:43,423 --> 00:15:44,758
Check it out, man!

248
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,794
Pineapple‐head is
running around from behind!

249
00:15:47,628 --> 00:15:48,696
Got it!

250
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:53,601
Aw, yeah!
Ya like that, don'cha?!

251
00:15:53,701 --> 00:15:56,870
Wow! Did you see how
far that guy just ran?!

252
00:15:56,970 --> 00:15:58,506
A delayed attack...

253
00:15:58,606 --> 00:16:01,875
So that's WakuNan's weapon:
It's their combination play.

254
00:16:01,975 --> 00:16:03,010
I mean, their
average height

255
00:16:03,110 --> 00:16:05,078
isn't really all
that impressive.

256
00:16:05,178 --> 00:16:07,480
Well, this shows
why they're always

257
00:16:07,581 --> 00:16:08,982
at the top of
the prefecture

258
00:16:09,082 --> 00:16:12,620
Yeah. But that's not the
only thing WakuNan is about.

259
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,121
Huh?

260
00:16:14,221 --> 00:16:15,823
Don't react to each and
every thing the spikers do!

261
00:16:15,923 --> 00:16:17,357
Go after
the ball!

262
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:19,827
I‐I know that...
in my head!

263
00:16:19,927 --> 00:16:22,362
The brain and the body
do not always agree...

264
00:16:22,462 --> 00:16:24,097
I know all about it.

265
00:16:25,498 --> 00:16:27,067
[Yu]:
Nice receive!

266
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:31,705
It's up! Cover me!

267
00:16:31,805 --> 00:16:32,873
Takeru! Last shot!

268
00:16:32,973 --> 00:16:35,809
We're gonna stop this!
Ready... now!

269
00:16:43,751 --> 00:16:45,686
[Spectator 1]:
A deflection!

270
00:16:45,786 --> 00:16:47,454
[Team WakuNan]:
Alright!

271
00:16:47,555 --> 00:16:49,790
[Shoyo]:
He just aimed at the
very edge of my hand!

272
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:53,026
So, Takeru's aerial
techniques are pretty dangerous.

273
00:16:53,126 --> 00:16:56,730
Almost as troublesome as
their combination play...

274
00:16:56,830 --> 00:16:58,699
Takeru Nakashima...

275
00:16:58,799 --> 00:17:01,735
[Keishin]:
Right now, in our prefecture,
his play‐style may be the most

276
00:17:01,835 --> 00:17:05,472
similar we've ever seen to
that of the "Tiny Giant."

277
00:17:05,573 --> 00:17:07,508
This kid is somethin' else...

278
00:17:14,615 --> 00:17:16,449
Take it to 'em, Takeru!

279
00:17:17,885 --> 00:17:19,319
Alright!

280
00:17:19,419 --> 00:17:22,289
[Spectator 2]:
Nakashima again!
He's good!

281
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:24,625
They've been keeping pace
with us the whole time.

282
00:17:24,725 --> 00:17:26,126
We've stayed
neck‐and‐neck.

283
00:17:26,226 --> 00:17:28,261
Neither team has been able
to pull away from the other!

284
00:17:28,361 --> 00:17:30,764
Takeru has a well‐trained
eye on the court...

285
00:17:30,864 --> 00:17:32,933
He and Hinata both
have a level of vision

286
00:17:33,033 --> 00:17:35,268
that can make something
out of nothing.

287
00:17:35,368 --> 00:17:37,004
Yeah.

288
00:17:37,104 --> 00:17:39,940
Now I'm not sure just how much
control this Takeru kid has.

289
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,675
But unlike
our little red,

290
00:17:41,775 --> 00:17:43,577
who fine‐tunes where
to aim every shot,

291
00:17:43,677 --> 00:17:47,581
I think he's being
creative with the angles.

292
00:17:47,681 --> 00:17:50,518
[Keishin]:
I think he's changing the
angles from spike to spike.

293
00:17:50,618 --> 00:17:53,053
Like, making an angle to hit
the hands of the blocker,

294
00:17:53,153 --> 00:17:55,989
creating deflections
and rebound arcs.

295
00:17:57,825 --> 00:18:00,761
Tsukishima, it's
all over your face.

296
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:02,495
Well... as a blocker,

297
00:18:02,596 --> 00:18:05,766
[Kei]:
it's only natural to be
sick of spikers like that.

298
00:18:05,866 --> 00:18:08,401
Let's get one, now!
You can do it!

299
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,007
That was the middle
of his chest!

300
00:18:14,107 --> 00:18:16,610
Even if he knew where it
was going, that was fast!

301
00:18:17,878 --> 00:18:19,913
Karasuno's Number 10
isn't gonna lose

302
00:18:20,013 --> 00:18:22,149
against WakuNan's
Number 1...

303
00:18:22,249 --> 00:18:23,216
Dammit!

304
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,285
You were almost able
to pick that one up!

305
00:18:25,385 --> 00:18:27,721
You'll get the next one.
Don't worry about it.

306
00:18:27,821 --> 00:18:30,290
You got this!
It's a piece of cake!

307
00:18:35,462 --> 00:18:39,533
Half of that was JUST to
taunt you. Don't fall for it!

308
00:18:39,633 --> 00:18:41,201
What the‐

309
00:18:43,103 --> 00:18:45,472
Well... I see
what they're doing.

310
00:18:45,573 --> 00:18:47,741
WakuNan has committed
one of their blockers

311
00:18:47,841 --> 00:18:49,543
to focus solely
on Hinata for now,

312
00:18:49,643 --> 00:18:52,312
but I guess they're choosing
not to chase him too much.

313
00:18:52,412 --> 00:18:54,181
They've decided
to deal with Hinata

314
00:18:54,281 --> 00:18:56,483
using a tall
middle blocker...

315
00:18:56,584 --> 00:18:59,052
[Keishin]:
They choose to narrow the shot
line instead of stopping it

316
00:18:59,152 --> 00:19:01,454
so it's easier
to receive.

317
00:19:01,555 --> 00:19:04,224
They've come to realize
they can't shut him down.

318
00:19:04,324 --> 00:19:06,827
They know that would be
impossible. On the other hand,

319
00:19:06,927 --> 00:19:09,329
they're not givin' him the
run of the court, either.

320
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:10,798
However...

321
00:19:10,898 --> 00:19:13,133
Look, I know we're in the middle
of a spectacle, here.

322
00:19:13,233 --> 00:19:15,335
It's the next generation
of Tiny Giants.

323
00:19:15,435 --> 00:19:19,306
But please, don't forget about
our tried and true method.

324
00:19:19,406 --> 00:19:20,340
Right.

325
00:19:21,408 --> 00:19:24,344
I think this
dude's after my job.

326
00:19:27,781 --> 00:19:32,252
[Daichi]:
Just as I thought. Their
middle blocker is onto Hinata,

327
00:19:32,352 --> 00:19:36,489
and the other two will
deal with all other spikers.

328
00:19:36,590 --> 00:19:39,560
But... if you're going
to stop our ace...

329
00:19:41,194 --> 00:19:44,497
You have to have
yourself an "Iron Wall"!

330
00:19:44,598 --> 00:19:46,366
Is that so, huh?

331
00:19:46,466 --> 00:19:47,935
Yeah!

332
00:19:48,035 --> 00:19:49,102
Go, Asahi!

333
00:19:49,202 --> 00:19:50,704
You crushed it!

334
00:19:50,804 --> 00:19:52,472
Yeah, thanks...

335
00:19:52,573 --> 00:19:55,242
All right, everything
is fine. Everyone is calm.

336
00:19:55,342 --> 00:19:57,811
Let's keep
going at it...!

337
00:19:57,911 --> 00:19:59,112
Ugh, this is crap...

338
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:03,250
Okay, okay, now,
let's cut one down!

339
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:05,252
[Nakashima]:
Number 3, Number 3!

340
00:20:09,156 --> 00:20:11,058
It looks like Karasuno
is attacking more

341
00:20:11,158 --> 00:20:12,325
from the left side.

342
00:20:12,425 --> 00:20:14,728
That guy with the beard,
he can kill it!

343
00:20:19,967 --> 00:20:21,702
Oh, there's finally
a two‐point lead.

344
00:20:21,802 --> 00:20:24,171
Looks like this match might
be going somewhere after all.

345
00:20:24,271 --> 00:20:27,875
All right, this is our chance!
Build up some momentum!

346
00:20:27,975 --> 00:20:28,776
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

347
00:20:28,876 --> 00:20:29,610
I hate these guys...

348
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:30,678
Hey, Tabi.

349
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:32,312
What?!

350
00:20:32,412 --> 00:20:33,881
Over there, on the right edge,
there's a really cute girl

351
00:20:33,981 --> 00:20:35,348
in the
third row.

352
00:20:35,448 --> 00:20:38,085
What? Seriously?!
Where is she?! Whooooaaaa!

353
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:39,887
I want the ball!

354
00:20:39,987 --> 00:20:42,255
Yeah, yeah...
Send it to me, I'm gonna kill
the crap out of it!

355
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:45,859
Well played, Takeru. You know
his personality all too well.

356
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,861
TAKERU!

357
00:20:47,961 --> 00:20:51,464
From way back, I've survived
living in the Jurassic Park

358
00:20:51,565 --> 00:20:53,233
of free spirits.

359
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,035
I'm gonna go
play outside!

360
00:20:55,135 --> 00:20:57,605
[Takeru]:
If my house is Jurassic Park...

361
00:20:59,507 --> 00:21:02,142
...this is still a zoo at best!

362
00:21:02,242 --> 00:21:04,011
Don't underestimate
the hardships

363
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:05,613
of the second‐born son!

364
00:21:05,713 --> 00:21:09,883
Tenacious WakuNan! Watch out...
our best is yet to come!

365
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:11,051
Yeah!

366
00:21:11,151 --> 00:21:12,553
Their captain's
a pretty good fit.

367
00:21:12,653 --> 00:21:14,555
He creates a solid
foundation for them.

368
00:21:14,655 --> 00:21:19,159
Yeah, if the last match was
a competition of style...

369
00:21:19,259 --> 00:21:22,195
[Keishin]:
...this is a collision
of captains.

370
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:25,098
[Nakashima]:
Number 11, Number 11!

371
00:21:29,169 --> 00:21:30,538
Whoa, they dug
it up again!

372
00:21:30,638 --> 00:21:33,340
They both connect with
the ball really well...

373
00:21:34,808 --> 00:21:36,476
Gah, they dug it up again!

374
00:21:36,577 --> 00:21:38,512
I'm having a hard time
just watching...

375
00:21:38,612 --> 00:21:40,514
This is the longest rally
we've had today...

376
00:21:40,614 --> 00:21:42,816
[Shimada]:
Whoever gets this
point will gain the momentum!

377
00:21:42,916 --> 00:21:45,986
Keep it up! Keep it goin'!
Make sure to get this one!

378
00:21:46,086 --> 00:21:47,087
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

379
00:21:47,187 --> 00:21:49,056
Takeru, comin' your way!

380
00:21:49,156 --> 00:21:51,424
[Kawatabi]:
Whoa! Triple block!

381
00:21:53,661 --> 00:21:55,228
Another deflection...!

382
00:21:57,731 --> 00:22:00,267
(rallying cheers)

383
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,078
Uh... what the‐?

384
00:22:21,989 --> 00:22:23,557
Uhh... Daichi?

385
00:23:55,549 --> 00:23:57,718
[Shoyo]:
I wish MY family
would come to the games!

386
00:23:57,818 --> 00:23:59,587
[Kei]:
I'd never want
anything like that.

387
00:23:59,687 --> 00:24:02,322
[Ryunosuke]:
I understand EXACTLY
how Tsukishima feels.

388
00:24:02,422 --> 00:24:04,457
[Kei]:
What? I agree
with Tanaka...?

389
00:24:04,558 --> 00:24:05,993
Not sure how I
feel about that.

390
00:24:06,093 --> 00:24:09,797
