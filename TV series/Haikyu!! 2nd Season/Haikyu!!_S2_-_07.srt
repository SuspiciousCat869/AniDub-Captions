1
00:00:04,779 --> 00:00:08,950
[SHOYO]
Awesome! Leaving in the
middle of the night makes
my heart race!

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,353
[RYUNOSUKE]
Oh right, you guys got there
late last time.

3
00:00:11,453 --> 00:00:15,022
[KEI]
It must be nice to be a
simpleton. You can fall asleep
anywhere.

4
00:00:15,122 --> 00:00:16,658
[RYUNOSUKE & SHOYO]
What did you say?!

5
00:00:16,758 --> 00:00:18,793
[TAKEDA]
Well, as you know,

6
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:20,728
we're scheduled to arrive
early in the morning again.

7
00:00:20,828 --> 00:00:24,332
Coach and I will be
taking turns as the driver
to cut the drive time.

8
00:00:24,432 --> 00:00:26,334
[KEISHIN]
(yawn) Sorry if I
fall asleep, guys.

9
00:00:26,434 --> 00:00:28,069
[DAICHI] We're with you, sir!
[ALL] Sir!

10
00:00:28,169 --> 00:00:30,171
[TAKEDA]
It's the middle of the
night, so keep it down.

11
00:00:30,272 --> 00:00:33,641
[DAICHI]
Oh! Yeah sorry I forgot..
(DAICHI & ASAHI humbled laugh)

12
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,244
[TAKEDA] Everyone got
all your luggage?
[KOSHI, internal]
Hinata and Kageyama;

13
00:00:36,344 --> 00:00:39,947
[TAKEDA] Check one
more time before we go.
[KOSHI]
They're barely speaking to

14
00:00:40,047 --> 00:00:42,517
[YU] C'mon, Tanaka, let's show
'em that Miyagi pride!
[KEISHIN] Well, time to
get going.

15
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:44,419
[RYUNOSUKE] Ready
when you are, Noya!
[KEISHIN] Stop yelling.

16
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:47,088
(KEI sighs)
[KOSHI]
Just get on the bus, guys.

17
00:02:20,448 --> 00:02:22,784
[SHOYO]
Hey, guys, where's
the Skytree?!

18
00:02:22,884 --> 00:02:24,419
[KENMA]
Uh, the Skytree?

19
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,188
[SHOYO]
Wow! Isn't that Tokyo Tower
over there? (amazement)

20
00:02:27,289 --> 00:02:31,726
[KENMA]
Um... that's just... a normal
radio tower... Sorry.

21
00:02:31,826 --> 00:02:35,029
[KUROO]
What's the deal? You guys don't
have steel towers in Miyagi?

22
00:02:35,129 --> 00:02:37,098
Is like this a real thing
I don't know about?

23
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:39,501
[DAICHI]
Oh well excuse us if
we simple country folks

24
00:02:39,601 --> 00:02:42,304
don't know exactly what
the Tokyo Tower looks like!

25
00:02:42,404 --> 00:02:46,474
[KOSHI]
Uh, this is Saitama.
We're not even IN Tokyo.

26
00:02:46,574 --> 00:02:48,776
[TOBIO, internal]
So that's not Tokyo Tower...?

27
00:02:48,876 --> 00:02:51,779
[SHOYO]
We're going to be at a different
high school than last time!

28
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:56,984
[KENMA]
All the summer training camps
are held at Shinzen. It's nice
and cool here.

29
00:02:58,253 --> 00:02:59,887
[KENMA]
There's a ton of bugs though.

30
00:02:59,987 --> 00:03:03,057
[HAIBA]
Hinata! Are you
any taller yet?! Huh?

31
00:03:03,157 --> 00:03:05,092
[KENMA]
Hm? Shut up, Lev.

32
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:07,161
[SHOYO]
It's only been two weeks
since I last saw you...

33
00:03:07,262 --> 00:03:09,096
Can't you think of
something else to say?!

34
00:03:09,196 --> 00:03:10,932
[HAIBA]
Well, I grew a coupla
millimeters!

35
00:03:11,032 --> 00:03:13,568
(SHOYO shocked)

36
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:16,271
[KEISHIN]
All right, we're going to be
swapping players constantly,

37
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:18,506
so be prepared for that. M'kay?

38
00:03:18,606 --> 00:03:19,707
[ALL]
Right!

39
00:03:19,807 --> 00:03:21,843
(long whistle)

40
00:03:21,943 --> 00:03:25,079
[BOKUTO]
Our goal is... no penalties!

41
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:28,650
(HITOKA nervous)

42
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:29,717
(whistle)

43
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:31,986
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nishinoya!

44
00:03:32,086 --> 00:03:32,954
[YU]
Got it!

45
00:03:33,054 --> 00:03:34,155
[DAICHI]
Nice receive!

46
00:03:34,256 --> 00:03:36,023
[TOBIO, internal]
Here's our chance!

47
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,126
[BOKUTO]
Okay here comes that wild
quick‐attack!

48
00:03:39,226 --> 00:03:43,398
[TOBIO]
Leave it there... leave it
there... leave it there..!

49
00:03:44,532 --> 00:03:45,633
(SHOYO gasp)

50
00:03:49,404 --> 00:03:51,739
[TOBIO, internal]
It was too short!

51
00:03:53,841 --> 00:03:56,911
[RYUNOSUKE]
What's up, Kageyama?
That wasn't like you, my man.

52
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:58,646
[TOBIO]
(mortified) I'm sorry.

53
00:03:58,746 --> 00:04:01,416
[TOBIO, internal]
Dammit... it feels different
in an actual game.

54
00:04:01,516 --> 00:04:03,318
(SHOYO concerned)

55
00:04:03,418 --> 00:04:05,720
[BOKUTO] All right!
One more! Serve it up!
[KEISHIN, internal]
Surprised you, didn't it?

56
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:07,989
[KEISHIN, internal]
Don't worry, you'll
get used to it.

57
00:04:08,089 --> 00:04:11,493
[KEISHIN, internal]
Kageyama's sets won't be
anything like what they
used to be.

58
00:04:11,593 --> 00:04:13,060
(whistle)

59
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,562
[YU]
I've got it!

60
00:04:17,865 --> 00:04:20,234
[TOBIO, internal]
(frustrated) This time,
it went out too far...!

61
00:04:23,771 --> 00:04:26,574
[KOSHI, internal]
He saved it with his left
hand at the last second!

62
00:04:29,977 --> 00:04:31,946
(whistle)
[TADASHI] Good one, Hinata!

63
00:04:32,046 --> 00:04:35,417
[KOSHI]
But the timing was
weird... That used to
always throw Hinata off.

64
00:04:35,517 --> 00:04:37,519
[YU]
That was nice! Good work!

65
00:04:37,619 --> 00:04:40,187
[SHOYO, internal]
The set came falling
down again...!

66
00:04:40,288 --> 00:04:43,157
[TOBIO, internal]
(heavy breath) This guy...

67
00:04:43,258 --> 00:04:45,327
[SHOYO & TOBIO, internal]
He's different now.

68
00:04:45,427 --> 00:04:47,529
(NEKOMATA chuckles)
[KONOHA] Shake it off!

69
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:50,131
[KOMI]
You couldn't have done
anything about that!
We'll get the next one!

70
00:04:50,231 --> 00:04:52,199
(NEKOMATA chuckles)
[NAOI] Hmm?

71
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:54,536
[KEISHIN, internal]
Hinata and Kageyama...

72
00:04:54,636 --> 00:04:58,205
[KEISHIN, internal]
They're not the only ones
who've changed things up.

73
00:05:00,508 --> 00:05:01,676
(ASAHI exhales)

74
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:07,982
[KOMI]
It's going out, it's out!

75
00:05:08,082 --> 00:05:09,917
[ASAHI] Tch.
(whistle)

76
00:05:10,017 --> 00:05:12,787
[HITOKA, internal]
(chuckle) Asahi's so revved up
he can't control his strength.

77
00:05:12,887 --> 00:05:15,623
[KEISHIN]
You're looking good!
Don't let up now!

78
00:05:20,562 --> 00:05:24,799
[NEKOMATA]
Well.. isn't this just
delightful... It's
delightfully...

79
00:05:24,899 --> 00:05:25,767
(KOSHI startled)

80
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,034
(RYUNOSUKE baffled)

81
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:28,303
(KURASUNO shocked) (whistle)

82
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,638
[NEKOMATA]
...not working at all. (chuckle)

83
00:05:30,738 --> 00:05:36,544
[OGANO]
Hey, call me crazy but uh...
I think Karasuno just tried to
pull off a synchronized attack!

84
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:38,646
[KOSHI]
Cover that!

85
00:05:38,746 --> 00:05:40,482
[YU]
Leave it to me!

86
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,016
(NEKOMATA surprised)
(NAOI surprised)

87
00:05:42,116 --> 00:05:43,285
The libero came out
from the back zone

88
00:05:43,385 --> 00:05:45,119
to attempt a jump set!

89
00:05:49,190 --> 00:05:50,758
[YU, internal]
I overshot it.

90
00:05:50,858 --> 00:05:54,296
[BOKUTO]
Hey, what's up with you guys
today? Are you all right?

91
00:05:54,396 --> 00:05:56,230
[YU]
Shut up! (growling)

92
00:05:56,331 --> 00:06:00,201
[NAOI]
What's going on with
Karasuno? They seem to
be having an off day.

93
00:06:00,302 --> 00:06:03,237
[NEKOMATA]
(chuckle) I would say
it's quite the opposite.

94
00:06:03,338 --> 00:06:07,208
[NAOI] Huh?
[NEKOMATA] This is exactly what
you'd expect from crows. They're
omnivores.

95
00:06:07,309 --> 00:06:13,080
[NEKOMATA]
Whether it be deep in the
mountains... or in the
center of Kabukicho...

96
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:17,552
[NEKOMATA]
they eat whatever they can...
using the strengths of all those
around them.

97
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:20,187
[NEKOMATA]
They survive by
any means necessary.

98
00:06:20,288 --> 00:06:22,557
[BOKUTO] Nice receive!
[DAICHI] Left, go left!
[NEKOMATA] I'd bet you anything
that those kids are

99
00:06:22,657 --> 00:06:26,127
[ASAHI] Bokuto!
[NEKOMATA]
in the midst of an
amazing period of

100
00:06:26,227 --> 00:06:27,862
[BOKUTO]
Take that!

101
00:06:27,962 --> 00:06:29,096
(whistle)

102
00:06:29,196 --> 00:06:31,799
[BOKUTO]
All right!

103
00:06:31,899 --> 00:06:34,201
[NEKOMATA, internal]
With one exception, perhaps?

104
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:37,772
(KEI exhales)
(long whistle)

105
00:06:37,872 --> 00:06:39,607
[EVERYONE]
Thanks for the game!

106
00:06:41,509 --> 00:06:45,847
[DAICHI]
The penalty for this camp is
apparently something you see
only at Shinzen:

107
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:50,618
[DAICHI]
a refreshing uphill dash through
the forest behind the school!

108
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,055
[DAICHI]
Okay... ready...

109
00:06:54,155 --> 00:06:56,724
(KURASUNO pumped up yelling)

110
00:06:56,824 --> 00:07:03,898
(heavy pace running)

111
00:07:06,634 --> 00:07:07,435
[HITOKA]
Here.

112
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,170
[TADASHI]
Oh... thanks a lot.

113
00:07:09,271 --> 00:07:10,538
[HITOKA]
Here, Sugawara.

114
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,340
[KOSHI] Oh, thank you!
[GOURA] Serve's up!

115
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,876
Are Shinzen and Ubugawa still
playing their first set?

116
00:07:14,976 --> 00:07:16,210
[SHOYO]
Mm‐hm.

117
00:07:18,546 --> 00:07:21,182
[SHOYO]
Whoa! That serve
was freaking amazing!

118
00:07:21,283 --> 00:07:23,217
[SHIMAFU]
Left side!

119
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:26,521
(UBUGAWA cheers)
[SHOYO] Wow! Shut right out!

120
00:07:26,621 --> 00:07:28,523
[KEISHIN] A serve
and block. Yeah...
[SHOYO & TADASHI] Oh?

121
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,358
[KEISHIN]
Break up the
opponent with the serve,

122
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,260
and once their method of
attack is narrowed down,

123
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,695
you stuff 'em with a block.

124
00:07:33,795 --> 00:07:35,697
That's the best attack
formation you could pull off,

125
00:07:35,797 --> 00:07:37,164
besides a service ace.

126
00:07:37,265 --> 00:07:40,502
[TADASHI]
Hm? Oh, so that's a
serve‐and‐block...

127
00:07:40,602 --> 00:07:42,337
[OGANO]
Damn you, fish lips...

128
00:07:42,437 --> 00:07:43,538
[GOURA]
Broccoli head...

129
00:07:43,638 --> 00:07:45,006
[KUROO]
Don't say that...

130
00:07:45,106 --> 00:07:46,173
It's an insult to healthy food.

131
00:07:46,274 --> 00:07:47,809
[OGANO]
What was that?!

132
00:07:49,511 --> 00:07:51,979
[KOSHI]
(sigh) Lost every match.

133
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:54,482
[DAICHI]
It does feel good to get out
and run a little though.

134
00:07:54,582 --> 00:07:59,454
[RYUNOSUKE]
This is the first time I've had
to run so much since the other
Coach Ukai was around!

135
00:07:59,554 --> 00:08:01,489
[DAICHI]
(sitting up) Come on you guys...

136
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:05,226
Let's go borrow Coach's tablet
and watch some videos of a few
synchronized attacks!

137
00:08:05,327 --> 00:08:06,594
[KOSHI] Sounds good.
[RYUNOSUKE] I'm in!

138
00:08:06,694 --> 00:08:08,095
[ASAHI]
I'll go hit up some serves.

139
00:08:08,195 --> 00:08:09,631
[ASAHI]
I need the practice.

140
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:11,666
[TADASHI, internal]
Huh? Serves?
I should go, too!

141
00:08:11,766 --> 00:08:13,735
[TADASHI]
Hey... uh... Tsukki...

142
00:08:13,835 --> 00:08:15,737
I'm gonna go work on my serves
if you want to come along...

143
00:08:15,837 --> 00:08:18,039
[KEI]
I'm going home and then
going straight to bed.

144
00:08:18,139 --> 00:08:20,908
[TADASHI]
Oh.. Okay... but uh...

145
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:23,911
[KEI] What?
[TADASHI] Don't take
this the wrong way but...

146
00:08:24,011 --> 00:08:26,514
but uh are you gonna do
anything to prepare at all?

147
00:08:26,614 --> 00:08:28,383
[KEI]
We practice way
too much as it is.

148
00:08:28,483 --> 00:08:29,784
(TADASHI surprised)

149
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,887
There is no use running
ourselves into the ground.

150
00:08:32,987 --> 00:08:35,857
[TADASHI]
I... guess so...

151
00:08:35,957 --> 00:08:39,594
Well... if that's
what you want...

152
00:08:45,199 --> 00:08:48,970
[KUROO] Hey, you! Skinny!
With the glasses!
[KEI] Hmm?

153
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:52,006
[KUROO]
Can you maybe jump a few blocks
for us?

154
00:08:52,106 --> 00:08:53,608
(BOKUTO stretching)

155
00:08:56,143 --> 00:09:00,047
[KEI] Sorry, I'm all done
for the day... You have a
good night.
[KUROO & BOKUTO] What?!

156
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:02,584
[BOKUTO]
But there's no point in
practicing our spiking

157
00:09:02,684 --> 00:09:05,587
if we don't have any
blockers! Come on!

158
00:09:05,687 --> 00:09:09,223
[KEI]
Why does it have to be me?
What about your own guys?

159
00:09:09,324 --> 00:09:10,892
[AKAASHI]
Nah, Bokuto's the worst...

160
00:09:10,992 --> 00:09:13,928
His spiking practice goes on
forever, it's like he never
stops.

161
00:09:14,028 --> 00:09:17,299
[KUROO]
And I've been too busy training
this bumbling idiot over here.

162
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:21,469
[HAIBA]
(exhausted moaning) I already
told you... I'll jump all those
blocks, I swear okay!

163
00:09:21,569 --> 00:09:23,137
[KUROO]
Oh be quiet!

164
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,507
[KUROO]
If you want to be part of
Nekoma's regular lineup,

165
00:09:25,607 --> 00:09:27,409
you're gonna need to
improve your receiving!

166
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:29,377
(HAIBA defeated whine)

167
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:30,678
[KUROO]
He may not look it...

168
00:09:30,778 --> 00:09:32,414
But this goofy fella is one of
the five

169
00:09:32,514 --> 00:09:34,282
best spikers in
the entire nation.

170
00:09:34,382 --> 00:09:37,352
[KUROO] He'll be some
awesome practice for ya.
(BOKUTO proud grin)

171
00:09:37,452 --> 00:09:40,588
[AKAASHI]
Yeah I think he's still upset
he's not in the top 3 anymore
though.

172
00:09:40,688 --> 00:09:43,958
[KUROO] There, there.
[BOKUTO] Why would you
say all that nice stuff
just to tear me down?!

173
00:09:44,058 --> 00:09:47,194
[KUROO]
Anyway skinny jeans...
You are a middle‐blocker...

174
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:50,998
[KUROO]
Don't you think you ought to
practice your blocking once
in a while, pal?

175
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:52,800
(KEI pissed exhale)

176
00:09:55,903 --> 00:09:59,874
(BOKUTO surprised)
(impressed snicker)

177
00:09:59,974 --> 00:10:01,042
(KUROO snide grin)

178
00:10:03,678 --> 00:10:07,982
[SHOYO, internal]
Today's quick‐attacks didn't
mesh at all... I gotta tighten
it up.

179
00:10:08,082 --> 00:10:12,620
[TOBIO, internal]
I need to make sure this
actually works before next
month...

180
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,088
(SHOYO & TOBIO stubborn sigh)

181
00:10:14,188 --> 00:10:16,391
[HITOKA] You guys want to
practice your quick attack?

182
00:10:16,491 --> 00:10:18,793
Come on... I'll throw
some balls for you!

183
00:10:18,893 --> 00:10:23,164
[SHOYO]
The way she's asking is kinda
pushy... and weird...

184
00:10:23,265 --> 00:10:24,999
[SHOYO]
W‐we're ready!

185
00:10:25,099 --> 00:10:27,001
[TOBIO]
Uh yeah, sure.

186
00:10:49,457 --> 00:10:51,025
[BOKUTO]
Let's do one more!

187
00:10:52,226 --> 00:10:53,428
[BOKUTO]
One more!

188
00:10:54,996 --> 00:10:56,398
[BOKUTO]
One more!

189
00:10:58,165 --> 00:10:59,601
[KEI, internal]
Straight!

190
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:04,706
[BOKUTO, internal]
You're a pretty smart cookie...
But!

191
00:11:04,806 --> 00:11:08,075
[BOKUTO] Yeah!
[AKAASHI] You are amazing,
you beat a single blocker...

192
00:11:08,175 --> 00:11:09,544
[BOKUTO]
Shut up!

193
00:11:10,678 --> 00:11:12,314
[KUROO]
Hey... how about we do a double?

194
00:11:12,414 --> 00:11:14,081
[BOKUTO]
Double? Bring it on!

195
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:15,883
[KEI]
Is he dead?

196
00:11:15,983 --> 00:11:17,585
[BOKUTO]
Here we go.

197
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,557
[KUROO]
Make sure you keep those
straights shut out, would
you, Skinny?

198
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:30,498
[KUROO]
Woohoo!

199
00:11:30,598 --> 00:11:31,933
[BOKUTO]
Aaghh! Dammit!

200
00:11:32,033 --> 00:11:34,101
(KEI low‐key surprised)
(BOKUTO frustrated groan)

201
00:11:34,201 --> 00:11:36,438
[BOKUTO]
You're not all that bad,
buddy‐boy...

202
00:11:36,538 --> 00:11:38,273
but you know, I gotta
be honest with ya...

203
00:11:38,373 --> 00:11:40,942
[BOKUTO] Your blocks are
a little bit weak.
(KEI stunned, anger growing)

204
00:11:41,042 --> 00:11:43,311
[BOKUTO]
Makes me think I might break
your arm or something.

205
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:45,880
You gotta rush in and
stop it, you know?!

206
00:11:45,980 --> 00:11:48,783
[KEI]
Well, on the other hand,
I'm only in high school,
after all...

207
00:11:48,883 --> 00:11:53,187
[KEI] I've still got a few more
years to grow and build up some
big ol' muscles.
(BOKUTO annoyed)

208
00:11:53,288 --> 00:11:55,457
[KUROO]
You better stop dragging your
feet there, Skinny,

209
00:11:55,557 --> 00:11:59,394
[KUROO]
or the carrot top's gonna take
all the glory for himself before
much longer.

210
00:11:59,494 --> 00:12:00,695
[KUROO]
He's a middle blocker too.

211
00:12:00,795 --> 00:12:03,230
[BOKUTO] Huh?
[KUROO] Hm?

212
00:12:03,331 --> 00:12:06,200
[KEI]
Um yeah I don't think there's
much I can do about that...

213
00:12:06,301 --> 00:12:10,872
I mean, let's be honest, there's
a big difference in potential
between Hinata and me.

214
00:12:10,972 --> 00:12:12,740
(KUROO doubtful)

215
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:16,644
[INUOKA]
Oh hey! You guys practicing
spikes again? Want me to block
some? I'm happy to!

216
00:12:16,744 --> 00:12:20,047
[YAKU]
Jeez, Lev, stop rolling around
on the floor and work on your
receives!

217
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:22,350
[HAIBA] Ugh! I'm tired!
[YAKU] Did you say you're
tired?!

218
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,086
[YAKU] Come on, get on your
feet! You've gotta perfect
that move!
[KEI]

219
00:12:25,186 --> 00:12:26,821
[KUROO] What? Hey wait!
[HAIBA] No, I've already
perfected that...

220
00:12:26,921 --> 00:12:28,523
[AKAASHI]
I think you might've
struck a little nerve

221
00:12:28,623 --> 00:12:30,625
[AKAASHI]
just then, Kuroo... Nice move.

222
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,260
[KUROO] Eh?
[BOKUTO] You pissed him off!

223
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,728
[BOKUTO]
Come on, Kuroo...

224
00:12:33,828 --> 00:12:35,730
I thought you had better
people skills than that.

225
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:39,066
[KUROO] Yeah well... I didn't
know he would be all like that.
[BOKUTO] Like what?

226
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:43,805
[KUROO]
Shorty over at Karasuno is
really something else, and face
it the kid is a serious threat.

227
00:12:43,905 --> 00:12:48,142
[KUROO]
That said, he's still very
inexperienced... And well like I
said, he's short.

228
00:12:48,242 --> 00:12:52,947
[KUROO]
Skinny is tall and brainy, and
yet he looks at Shorty not just
as an equal,

229
00:12:53,047 --> 00:12:55,983
[KUROO]
but as someone that he
is no match against.

230
00:12:59,821 --> 00:13:02,824
[KEI, internal]
Great, I forgot my
brace at the gym.

231
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,395
[KOSHI]
One more!

232
00:13:07,495 --> 00:13:09,997
[RYUNOSUKE]
Wasn't the timing a little
bit too early there?

233
00:13:10,097 --> 00:13:14,235
[KOSHI]
Oh, you think so? Then next one,
I'll delay it by one tempo.

234
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:17,104
[KIYOKO]
Here goes!

235
00:13:19,407 --> 00:13:20,542
[DAICHI]
Sorry! One more!

236
00:13:20,642 --> 00:13:22,043
[KEI]
It's nothing but a stupid game.

237
00:13:22,143 --> 00:13:23,478
[RYUNOSUKE]
Bring it!

238
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:25,647
[KEI]
How can these guys get
into it so much.

239
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:27,649
I don't get it.

240
00:13:31,453 --> 00:13:33,655
[KEI]
It'll just hurt you in the end.

241
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:44,031
[YU]
Tsukishima!

242
00:13:44,131 --> 00:13:46,067
Eat up so you'll
have some energy!

243
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:49,937
[KEI] Look at you...
You are such a fat‐ass.
[YU] What'd you call me?

244
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:53,107
[YU] Oh I am going to
make you pay for that!
[ERI] Here you go.
[SHOYO] Ah! Th‐Thanks,

245
00:13:53,207 --> 00:13:56,143
[KEI]
Hey, stop it... You're gonna
mess up my glasses!

246
00:13:56,244 --> 00:13:59,080
[KOSHI]
Stop... You're gonna
make Daichi mad.

247
00:13:59,681 --> 00:14:00,948
(whistle)

248
00:14:05,287 --> 00:14:06,488
(long whistle)

249
00:14:06,588 --> 00:14:07,855
[DAICHI]
Go!

250
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,494
[DAICHI]
Go!

251
00:14:12,594 --> 00:14:15,029
(uphill running)

252
00:14:17,332 --> 00:14:18,199
[DAICHI]
Go!

253
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,268
(uphill running)

254
00:14:20,368 --> 00:14:24,772
(KEI panting)

255
00:14:24,872 --> 00:14:26,941
(TADASHI glugging)
[KOSHI] Here, Hinata.
[SHOYO] Thanks!

256
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:32,447
[ERI]
Everyone! The Shinzen High
School club parents came! They
brought us watermelon!

257
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,382
(ALL impressed)

258
00:14:36,984 --> 00:14:39,153
[SHOYO]
Whoa! That's really cool! Plgh!

259
00:14:39,254 --> 00:14:40,322
(HAIBA chuckling)

260
00:14:42,724 --> 00:14:44,225
[TOBIO]
Hey uh can I have another one?

261
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,827
[HITOKA] Sure!
[TOBIO] Hm.

262
00:14:45,927 --> 00:14:49,264
Huh? Tsukishima, are you sure
you only wanted one piece?

263
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:51,032
[KEI]
Yeah. It was delicious.

264
00:14:51,132 --> 00:14:54,068
[ASAHI]
When I was a kid, I ate so much
of this stuff I got sick.

265
00:14:54,168 --> 00:14:56,237
[KUROO] Sorry, dude.
[DAICHI, ASAHI, RYUNOSUKE] Hmmm?

266
00:14:56,338 --> 00:14:57,605
[DAICHI]
Uh, what for?

267
00:14:57,705 --> 00:14:59,707
Yesterday... I kinda had
a little disagreement

268
00:14:59,807 --> 00:15:01,643
with your big lanky blocker
with the glasses.

269
00:15:01,743 --> 00:15:02,544
[DAICHI]
Huh?

270
00:15:02,644 --> 00:15:04,479
(SHOYO frustrated)

271
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:08,483
[HAIBA] (laugh) You
really suck at that!
[DAICHI]
First of all, I can't believe

272
00:15:08,583 --> 00:15:10,285
[DAICHI]
Anyway, what was the fuss about?

273
00:15:10,385 --> 00:15:12,186
[KUROO]
I warned him that the short guy
on your team

274
00:15:12,287 --> 00:15:14,055
[KUROO] would outdo him
soon, that's all.
(DAICHI surprised)

275
00:15:14,155 --> 00:15:16,157
I guess it IS true that
Tsukishima feels

276
00:15:16,258 --> 00:15:18,260
a little inferior
compared to Hinata...

277
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:21,863
[KEI]
It's Hinata's job to deal out
the real damage...

278
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:23,831
[KEI]
Think about it. From my
position,

279
00:15:23,931 --> 00:15:28,135
all I'm supposed to be
responsible for is holding down
the fort the best I can.

280
00:15:28,235 --> 00:15:30,505
[KEI]
It's no different than any
other game, really.

281
00:15:30,605 --> 00:15:32,874
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uh, I dunno if this has
anything to do with

282
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,876
what we're talking about...
but my uh sister said...

283
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:37,412
[SAEKO] Say uh
you know something?
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?

284
00:15:37,512 --> 00:15:41,015
I heard a name while you
were playing at your little
training camp.

285
00:15:41,115 --> 00:15:44,652
[SAEKO]
Do you guys have a player
on the team named Tsukishima?

286
00:15:44,752 --> 00:15:47,289
[RYUNOSUKE]
(annoyed) Uh‐huh yeah, sure we
do...

287
00:15:47,389 --> 00:15:51,158
[RYUNOSUKE]
The smartass with the glasses
who doesn't get along with
anybody else, what about him?

288
00:15:51,259 --> 00:15:54,996
[SAEKO]
Does this Tsukishima guy have
like a... a brother?

289
00:15:55,096 --> 00:15:59,301
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh? How should I know? He's not
really the type of guy to talk
about himself.

290
00:15:59,401 --> 00:16:01,936
[SAEKO]
Well uh when I was
back in high school...

291
00:16:02,036 --> 00:16:05,239
You know back when our
volleyball team was at
their very best.

292
00:16:05,340 --> 00:16:07,108
[RYUNOSUKE]
When the Tiny
Giant used to play?

293
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,110
[SAEKO]
Right... Back then, I think
there was

294
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:13,248
a really tall player with
the same last name on the
volleyball team.

295
00:16:13,348 --> 00:16:15,850
[ASAHI] Huh?
[DAICHI] Hm? Tsukishima's
brother maybe?

296
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,785
[RYUNOSUKE]
Oh, well I don't
know about that.

297
00:16:17,885 --> 00:16:21,389
I mean it could be a total
stranger that happened to
have the same last name.

298
00:16:21,489 --> 00:16:24,359
[KOSHI]
Hey! We're getting ready to
start up again!

299
00:16:24,459 --> 00:16:25,793
[DAICHI]
All right, let's go!

300
00:16:25,893 --> 00:16:29,163
[RYUNOSUKE]
Oh! Cool, let's do it! (eating)

301
00:16:32,334 --> 00:16:34,101
(long whistle)

302
00:16:34,201 --> 00:16:34,902
[DAICHI]
Go!

303
00:16:35,002 --> 00:16:38,239
(running uphill, grunting)

304
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:40,542
(KURASUNO out of breath)
[KOSHI] This is really tough...

305
00:16:40,642 --> 00:16:43,745
[YU]
This is nothing! I could do this
at least ten more times!

306
00:16:43,845 --> 00:16:45,447
[KOSHI]
How 'bout we just win one?

307
00:16:45,547 --> 00:16:47,982
(TADASHI & KEI out of breath)

308
00:16:51,953 --> 00:16:55,957
[ASAHI]
Hey Tadashi... your serves
are looking quite a bit better
these days.

309
00:16:56,057 --> 00:16:58,460
[TADASHI]
Oh. Thanks a lot Asahi.

310
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,195
[ASAHI]
Yeah. I still have some
work to do on mine.

311
00:17:01,296 --> 00:17:03,965
[KEI]
I bet you must really hate
what's going on, huh?

312
00:17:04,065 --> 00:17:05,700
[ASAHI]
Hate what?

313
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:09,203
[KEI]
The feeling you're about to be
eclipsed by someone else.

314
00:17:09,304 --> 00:17:13,441
[ASAHI]
(laugh) Well... I can't say it
doesn't bother me.

315
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:17,879
[KEI]
Hinata still wants to be the
ace... I dunno, if it were me,
I'd be uncomfortable.

316
00:17:17,979 --> 00:17:19,847
[ASAHI]
Yeah I guess so.

317
00:17:19,947 --> 00:17:23,318
[ASAHI]
But maybe that's why he
started saying that he
won't stop growing.

318
00:17:23,418 --> 00:17:27,154
[ASAHI]
Either way, it seems to have lit
a fire underneath all of us,
hasn't it?

319
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:29,857
[KEI]
I saw what happened before;
if you're not careful,

320
00:17:29,957 --> 00:17:31,893
he'll get too focused
and run you right off the court.

321
00:17:31,993 --> 00:17:34,562
[ASAHI]
Huh?

322
00:17:34,662 --> 00:17:38,766
[ASAHI]
Oh, you mean when I jumped
up to spike and we hit each
other.

323
00:17:38,866 --> 00:17:40,635
[ASAHI]
Let's face it, Tsukishima...

324
00:17:40,735 --> 00:17:44,539
given our positions, we
are the closest ones to
being his rivals.

325
00:17:44,639 --> 00:17:47,309
[ASAHI]
So y'know... we feel how
Hinata is growing up

326
00:17:47,409 --> 00:17:50,345
and stretching his wings a lot
more than anyone else does.

327
00:17:50,445 --> 00:17:55,016
[ASAHI]
But whatever man... I'm not
letting him beat me.

328
00:17:58,753 --> 00:18:00,688
[RYUNOSUKE]
Left, left!

329
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:01,623
(whistle)

330
00:18:01,723 --> 00:18:03,325
[RYUNOSUKE]
All right!

331
00:18:03,425 --> 00:18:06,461
[TOBIO]
Hey, stop slacking off!
Decoys still have to jump!

332
00:18:06,561 --> 00:18:09,063
[KEI]
So observant of you...
Sorry, all right?

333
00:18:09,163 --> 00:18:12,467
[DAICHI] Tsukishima,
you got next serve.
[KEI] Okay.
[KEISHIN] What do YOU think

334
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:15,837
[TAKEDA]
Huh? Well, I think he's working
diligently.

335
00:18:15,937 --> 00:18:20,074
[RYUNOSUKE] Let's go!
[KEISHIN]
He passes the test, but never
aims for a perfect score.

336
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:22,444
[KEISHIN]
That's the feeling
I get from him.

337
00:18:22,544 --> 00:18:24,812
[KOSHI] It's coming
from the left side!
[KEISHIN]
I don't need him

338
00:18:24,912 --> 00:18:28,750
[TADASHI] You better keep
an eye on that Number 4!
[KEISHIN]
But if other players keep

339
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:31,253
[TADASHI, KOSHI, & CHIKARA]
Nice going guys!
[SHOYO] Center!
[KEISHIN] The ones I keep on the

340
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:33,588
[KEISHIN]
the ones I think give us
the best chance to win.

341
00:18:33,688 --> 00:18:37,158
[KEISHIN]
But as the tallest player,
he is valuable.
(whistle) (KURASUNO celebrate)

342
00:18:37,259 --> 00:18:39,394
[KEISHIN]
If Tsukishima can be the key
point for the blocks...

343
00:18:39,494 --> 00:18:42,163
our defensive level will
go up significantly...

344
00:18:42,264 --> 00:18:43,831
[TAKEDA]
You're right about that.

345
00:18:43,931 --> 00:18:45,733
[RYUNOSUKE]
Cover! Cover!

346
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:46,901
[DAICHI] I got it!
[YU] I got it!

347
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,169
(DAICHI & YU collision)

348
00:18:48,270 --> 00:18:50,338
(HITOKA & KIYOKO gasp)
[DAICHI & YU] Sorry!

349
00:18:50,438 --> 00:18:52,940
[HITOKA]
They're all really into this,
aren't they?

350
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:56,744
[KIYOKO]
Yeah all the guys have been into
the game like they've never been
before...

351
00:18:56,844 --> 00:18:59,781
[KIYOKO] And it can make it
a little scary sometimes.
(HITOKA concerned)

352
00:18:59,881 --> 00:19:04,786
[KIYOKO]
Contact like last time can lead
to huge injuries.

353
00:19:04,886 --> 00:19:06,888
[ASAHI]
Watch the left! Number 1!

354
00:19:08,756 --> 00:19:10,725
[RYUNOSUKE]
Asahi! It's all you!

355
00:19:10,825 --> 00:19:11,759
(KIYOKO & KEISHIN gasp)

356
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:13,495
[KIYOKO]
It's a bit short...!

357
00:19:14,696 --> 00:19:16,163
(SHOYO stunned)

358
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,535
[ASAHI, internal]
This ball is mine!

359
00:19:27,141 --> 00:19:28,810
(whistle)
(ALL amazed)

360
00:19:28,910 --> 00:19:30,912
(UBUGAWA shocked)

361
00:19:32,113 --> 00:19:33,781
[NEKOMATA, internal]
It's working well.

362
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:36,584
[NEKOMATA]
Even within one's own team,
the tension from acknowledging

363
00:19:36,684 --> 00:19:40,154
[RYUNOSUKE] Now that's a kill,
Asahi! You crushed that thing!
[NEKOMATA]
you are rivals with one another

364
00:19:40,255 --> 00:19:45,092
[ASAHI] Thanks.
[NEKOMATA]
However, if the team turns into
a group with no laws, they'll

365
00:19:45,192 --> 00:19:50,332
[NEKOMATA]
Now this kid tightened things up
with just a single shot...
that's the ace for you!

366
00:19:50,432 --> 00:19:54,201
[KIYOKO]
Hmm... Looks like I didn't need
to worry after all.

367
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:56,938
(ASAHI clench fist)

368
00:19:57,038 --> 00:20:00,275
(KURASUNO uphill running)

369
00:20:00,775 --> 00:20:02,444
(KEI panting)

370
00:20:04,746 --> 00:20:06,348
[TADASHI]
You okay, Tsukki?

371
00:20:07,882 --> 00:20:11,519
[KEI]
I'll be all right...
Go without me. (out of breath)

372
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,058
[TADASHI]
Uh okay... I...
I'll see ya then.

373
00:20:27,835 --> 00:20:30,572
[SHOYO]
Practice time!

374
00:20:30,672 --> 00:20:33,174
[KOSHI] Another day of
humiliating losses...
(RYUNOSUKE exhausted)

375
00:20:36,444 --> 00:20:38,646
[ASAHI]
He's still the same as he's
always been.

376
00:20:38,746 --> 00:20:41,283
[RYUNOSUKE] You mean Tsukishima?
[ASAHI] Yeah.

377
00:20:41,383 --> 00:20:44,018
[RYUNOSUKE]
That guy... How do I
explain it... Ugh...

378
00:20:44,118 --> 00:20:47,789
I feel like he could do
anything he wants to if
he'd just freakin' try.

379
00:20:47,889 --> 00:20:49,190
[ASAHI]
What kind of things?

380
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,593
[RYUNOSUKE]
Like... Uh I don't know...

381
00:20:51,693 --> 00:20:54,796
[RYUNOSUKE]
Like uh.... Agh, what
a waste of height!

382
00:20:54,896 --> 00:20:57,265
[BOKUTO]
Hey, Skinny!

383
00:20:57,365 --> 00:20:59,200
You wanna help us out with
our spikes again today?

384
00:20:59,301 --> 00:21:02,203
[KEI]
I'm sorry... but I'm gonna pass.

385
00:21:02,304 --> 00:21:05,307
[BOKUTO] What, really?
Hey Kuroo!
[KUROO] Shut up.

386
00:21:05,407 --> 00:21:07,375
[BOKUTO]
I haven't said anything yet!

387
00:21:07,475 --> 00:21:09,043
[SHOYO]
What?

388
00:21:09,143 --> 00:21:11,979
So do you like have something
against the ace of Fukurodani?

389
00:21:12,079 --> 00:21:15,082
[KEI] Course not.
[SHOYO] Then why say no?!
That seems like such a waste!

390
00:21:15,182 --> 00:21:19,421
[KEI]
Would you please shut up?
Unlike you, I'm not a stupid
ball of energy.

391
00:21:20,054 --> 00:21:21,523
[SHOYO]
Hey, not cool!

392
00:21:22,290 --> 00:21:23,858
[SHOYO]
What's his problem?!

393
00:21:23,958 --> 00:21:26,328
[SHOYO]
Fukurodani's ace player makes
the effort to invite him

394
00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:30,064
to practice and he just says
no?! He is such a jerk!

395
00:21:30,164 --> 00:21:32,734
[TADASHI] Hinata... listen...
[SHOYO] Hmm?

396
00:21:32,834 --> 00:21:36,504
[TADASHI] Um what would you
say to Tsukki right now if
you could?
[SHOYO] Huh?

397
00:21:36,604 --> 00:21:42,043
[TADASHI]
You know, like before... when
you talked to Kageyama and
Yachi.

398
00:21:43,845 --> 00:21:46,481
[SHOYO] I wouldn't say anything.
(TADASHI startled)

399
00:21:46,581 --> 00:21:49,917
[SHOYO]
How could I, when I don't even
know if Tsukishima likes
volleyball?

400
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:54,556
[SHOYO]
What's the point of saying
"Let's play" to somebody who
doesn't even want to?!

401
00:21:54,656 --> 00:21:58,059
[SHOYO]
Argh! He doesn't know how lucky
he is to be that tall!

402
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:02,364
[SHOYO]
I mean if I had that kind of
ridiculous height.. I would be
unstoppable! It's not fair!

403
00:22:02,464 --> 00:22:04,299
[TADASHI] Well...
(SHOYO surprised)

404
00:22:05,467 --> 00:22:08,102
Look Tsukki doesn't hate
volleyball, Hinata...

405
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:12,274
Or else, he never
would've joined the club.

406
00:22:12,374 --> 00:22:14,676
[SHOYO] What about you?
[TADASHI] Huh?

407
00:22:14,776 --> 00:22:18,079
[SHOYO]
What would you say?
What would you tell him?

408
00:23:55,076 --> 00:23:58,012
[SHOYO]
Lev! Teach me how to spit
watermelon seeds really far!

409
00:23:58,112 --> 00:24:00,915
[HAIBA] First, curl your mouth
like a blowpipe!
[SHOYO] Okay!

410
00:24:01,015 --> 00:24:03,251
[HAIBA] Spit at a
45 degree angle!
[SHOYO] Yeah?

411
00:24:03,351 --> 00:24:04,586
[HAIBA]
Now bend your body
back like a whip...

412
00:24:04,686 --> 00:24:06,588
[SHOYO]
(swallows) I swallowed 'em...

413
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:09,357
[SHOYO]
Next Haikyu!!
"Illusionary Hero".
