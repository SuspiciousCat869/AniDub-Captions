1
00:00:02,579 --> 00:00:04,313
[TAKEDA]
It'll be tricky.

2
00:00:04,413 --> 00:00:08,417
[TAKEDA]
Exams are also next month...
You do know that, don't you?

3
00:00:08,518 --> 00:00:09,385
(KEISHIN shocked)

4
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:12,354
[TAKEDA]
Don't you?

5
00:00:12,454 --> 00:00:14,957
[TAKEDA]
I'm sure you can guess what I'm
about to say.

6
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:16,526
(YU & RYUNOSUKE quivering)

7
00:00:16,626 --> 00:00:19,261
(TOBIO quivering)
[TAKEDA] If you fail
even one subject...

8
00:00:19,361 --> 00:00:20,462
(SHOYO quivering)

9
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:23,199
[VICE PRINCIPAL]
Extra lessons on weekends.

10
00:00:23,299 --> 00:00:26,068
And possibly during
the summer as well...

11
00:00:26,168 --> 00:00:29,171
So wouldn't that make your
little field trip impossible?

12
00:00:29,271 --> 00:00:30,673
(ALL shouting)

13
00:00:30,773 --> 00:00:33,242
[DAICHI]
Hey! This isn't something you
can just run away from!

14
00:00:33,342 --> 00:00:34,744
Ennoshita, go get them!

15
00:00:34,844 --> 00:00:35,912
[CHIKARA]
Hmhm.

16
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:37,714
Okay... So what's failing?

17
00:00:37,814 --> 00:00:38,815
How bad can I do?

18
00:00:38,915 --> 00:00:41,183
[KOSHI]
Are you serious?!

19
00:00:41,283 --> 00:00:42,985
You guys, I think
Kageyama's dead!

20
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:44,687
[KOSHI]
Well, the pressure's
already high for us

21
00:00:44,787 --> 00:00:46,222
third‐years to make good grades,

22
00:00:46,322 --> 00:00:48,157
[KOSHI]
since we decided to
stay with the club.

23
00:00:48,257 --> 00:00:50,527
[KEI] Yeah NONE of us
can afford to fail.
[CHIKARA] No kidding.

24
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:54,263
[SHOYO]
Wait! Maybe if we ask the vice
principal nicely, we can still
have a chance to...

25
00:00:54,363 --> 00:00:58,167
[KEI]
Why don't you just focus all
that energy on actually passing
your classes?

26
00:00:58,267 --> 00:01:00,436
Even if the school didn't
make you forgo the trip...

27
00:01:00,537 --> 00:01:03,940
the tutoring sessions
could still cause a
scheduling conflict.

28
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:08,077
[SHOYO]
(devastated) Coach, help!

29
00:01:08,177 --> 00:01:12,114
[KEISHIN]
Gah... Well, this is just a part
of being a high school student,
you know‐

30
00:01:12,214 --> 00:01:14,851
[SHOYO] Yeah, but‐!
[KEISHIN] Chin up, Red!
Just try to stay positive!

31
00:01:14,951 --> 00:01:20,022
[SHOYO]
Stay positive?! Fine... If
you say so, I'll do my best...
Could you tutor me?

32
00:01:20,122 --> 00:01:25,427
[KEISHIN] Hinata...
You're not gonna like
what I'm about to say.
(SHOYO gasps)

33
00:01:25,528 --> 00:01:28,831
[KEISHIN]
Do I really look to you like the
kind of guy who got good grades?

34
00:01:28,931 --> 00:01:31,668
[SHOYO]
(mind blown gasp) No.

35
00:01:31,768 --> 00:01:36,205
[KOSHI]
Hinata... You're overreacting;
I'm sure everything's gonna work
out just fine.

36
00:01:36,305 --> 00:01:38,941
[SHOYO]
No... You don't get it; on a
hundred‐point scale,

37
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:40,777
I don't even score in
the double digits...

38
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:42,111
How am I ever gonna pass?

39
00:01:42,211 --> 00:01:45,247
[KOSHI] Huh?
[SHOYO] What?

40
00:01:45,347 --> 00:01:47,650
[KOSHI]
You're already saying your
prayers?! How bad IS this?!

41
00:01:47,750 --> 00:01:49,686
(SHOYO, RYUNOSUKE, TOBIO, & YU
screaming, various as of
distress and sobbing)

42
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:51,187
[KEISHIN]
Takeda, get a grip!

43
00:01:51,287 --> 00:01:53,956
[KEI]
Ha ha! They're so dead!

44
00:01:54,757 --> 00:01:56,358
[DAICHI] Calm down!
[ALL] Huh?

45
00:01:56,458 --> 00:01:58,661
[DAICHI]
You still have
time before exams.

46
00:01:58,761 --> 00:02:02,932
You might be numbskulls...
but can Karasuno win games
without you?

47
00:02:03,032 --> 00:02:04,233
[DAICHI]
I don't think so!

48
00:02:04,333 --> 00:02:05,602
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uh, yeah thanks for the...

49
00:02:05,702 --> 00:02:07,837
compliment, I guess?

50
00:02:08,638 --> 00:02:10,139
[DAICHI]
We are doing this...

51
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,375
ALL of us...
Now let's go to Tokyo!

52
00:03:50,039 --> 00:03:56,078
Listen, you four... From now on,
you have one rule. And it's very
simple.

53
00:03:56,178 --> 00:03:58,380
[DAICHI] Never fall
asleep in class!
(ALL startled)

54
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,982
[ASAHI]
They have to be TOLD that?

55
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:02,151
[DAICHI]
Don't pull any all‐nighters...

56
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:04,453
[DAICHI]
They'll make you slow in class
AND on the court...

57
00:04:04,554 --> 00:04:06,923
[DAICHI]
Get 8 hours of
sleep every night!

58
00:04:07,023 --> 00:04:08,925
[YU & SHOYO]
(wounded) Okay...

59
00:04:09,025 --> 00:04:11,060
[KEI]
See you guys later.

60
00:04:11,794 --> 00:04:13,429
[ASAHI]
Cool. See ya.

61
00:04:14,931 --> 00:04:16,498
It's gonna be all right...

62
00:04:16,599 --> 00:04:19,035
I mean you passed your
entrance exams to get
in here, didn't you?

63
00:04:19,135 --> 00:04:20,837
[RYUNOSUKE]
(whimper) Thanks, Suga!

64
00:04:20,937 --> 00:04:22,071
But if you do fall asleep,

65
00:04:22,171 --> 00:04:24,406
I'll make sure you
face the consequences.

66
00:04:26,242 --> 00:04:28,578
[SHOYO]
(exertion) Kageyama...

67
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:31,814
[TOBIO] Hmm?
(SHOYO conspicuous
inaudible whispering)

68
00:04:31,914 --> 00:04:33,315
[TOBIO]
What?! No!

69
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:35,117
[SHOYO]
Hey, don't be so selfish!

70
00:04:35,217 --> 00:04:37,286
[SHOYO]
If we fail the test, we
don't get to go to Tokyo!

71
00:04:37,386 --> 00:04:40,089
[SHOYO]
It's Nekoma! And some
other good Tokyo teams too!

72
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:45,027
[SHOYO]
You can't pass that up! Plus I
thought you told Ushiwaka you
were gonna be the best setter!

73
00:04:45,127 --> 00:04:50,132
(TOBIO annoyed) (grunt)

74
00:04:50,232 --> 00:04:52,835
[TADASHI]
So it turns out Kageyama gets
bad grades too...

75
00:04:52,935 --> 00:04:55,437
[TADASHI]
You'd think he'd be a little
smarter than the rest of 'em...

76
00:04:55,538 --> 00:04:57,907
Hinata doesn't really
surprise me though.

77
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:02,178
[KEI]
Yeah, his brain's just like a
volleyball; nothing but empty
space inside.

78
00:05:02,278 --> 00:05:03,646
[SHOYO]
TSUKISHIMAAA!

79
00:05:03,746 --> 00:05:04,881
[TADASHI & KEI]
Huh?

80
00:05:04,981 --> 00:05:06,182
[SHOYO]
Sorry...

81
00:05:06,282 --> 00:05:09,586
Can you help us
study?! Please?!

82
00:05:09,686 --> 00:05:11,387
[KEI]
Me? No thank you.

83
00:05:11,487 --> 00:05:14,223
[SHOYO]
(shattered) Just a couple
minutes a day!

84
00:05:14,323 --> 00:05:17,994
Or at least maybe give me a
few pointers here and there!

85
00:05:18,094 --> 00:05:21,664
[TADASHI]
Couldn't you maybe spare some
time before or after practice?

86
00:05:23,299 --> 00:05:24,801
[KEI]
Don't you think it's kind of
unfair of you

87
00:05:24,901 --> 00:05:27,704
to make the little guy do
all the groveling, Kageyama?

88
00:05:27,804 --> 00:05:29,105
[KEI]
I want to hear it from you.

89
00:05:29,205 --> 00:05:30,272
(TOBIO angry)

90
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:32,675
[SHOYO]
Let it go! You have to!

91
00:05:34,877 --> 00:05:36,713
[TOBIO]
Please help us.

92
00:05:36,813 --> 00:05:38,380
[KEI]
What's that?

93
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,517
[TOBIO]
Could you please help us study?

94
00:05:40,617 --> 00:05:42,885
[KEI]
Sorry, could you
please speak up?

95
00:05:42,985 --> 00:05:46,488
[TOBIO]
I'M ASKING YOU... WOULD YOU
PLEASE HELP US STUDY!

96
00:05:46,589 --> 00:05:47,724
(ALL startled)

97
00:05:47,824 --> 00:05:50,192
[KEISHIN]
What's all that racket?!
Keep it down!

98
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:52,161
[SHOYO, TOBIO, & TADASHI]
S‐Sorry, Coach...

99
00:05:52,261 --> 00:05:54,230
[KEI]
I didn't do anything.

100
00:06:04,073 --> 00:06:05,074
[STUDENTS]
Sorry.

101
00:06:05,174 --> 00:06:06,408
[KIYOKO]
Oh no, that's alright.

102
00:06:06,509 --> 00:06:08,177
[SHOYO] Kiyoko!
[KIYOKO] Huh?

103
00:06:08,277 --> 00:06:09,712
[SHOYO]
I looked for people
in other classes

104
00:06:09,812 --> 00:06:12,081
that haven't joined a club...
Here's what I found out.

105
00:06:12,181 --> 00:06:13,916
[KIYOKO]
Hm? Oh thanks a lot.

106
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:16,152
[SHOYO]
Oh, it's uh...

107
00:06:16,886 --> 00:06:18,521
[KIYOKO]
Hm? (soft laugh)

108
00:06:18,621 --> 00:06:20,757
[SHOYO, internal]
What's so funny?
(shakes it off)

109
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:24,193
Uh, listen... it's gotta be
really hard for you

110
00:06:24,293 --> 00:06:26,295
doing all the manager's work
by yourself, isn't it?

111
00:06:26,395 --> 00:06:29,165
[SHOYO]
Let me know if I can do
anything.

112
00:06:29,766 --> 00:06:30,833
(KIYOKO acknowledges)

113
00:06:32,034 --> 00:06:33,269
[KIYOKO]
After the next tournament,

114
00:06:33,369 --> 00:06:36,072
we third‐years will
be gone, y'know.

115
00:06:36,172 --> 00:06:38,240
[KIYOKO]
And well, you've
all improved so much,

116
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,811
[KIYOKO]
I've been wondering what our
team's going to look like after
this year's over.

117
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:45,414
But of course, I'm
determined to do my share
of the work until then.

118
00:06:45,515 --> 00:06:47,183
[SHOYO]
Uh... let me help you!

119
00:06:47,283 --> 00:06:48,518
[KIYOKO]
(surprised) Thank you...

120
00:06:48,618 --> 00:06:50,452
But final exams
should come first.

121
00:06:50,553 --> 00:06:52,822
(SHOYO speechless)
[KIYOKO] And then
practice, of course.

122
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:57,126
(SHOYO surprised)
[KIYOKO] I mean, you
are the Greatest Decoy...
We're gonna need you.

123
00:06:57,226 --> 00:06:58,194
[SHOYO]
Right!

124
00:06:58,294 --> 00:07:00,429
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

125
00:07:01,297 --> 00:07:03,199
[KEI]
Okay, let's try the next one.

126
00:07:03,299 --> 00:07:06,869
[KEI] Hinata, take
a look at number 6.
[KOSHI] That one
works out like this.

127
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:08,004
[YU]
Oh!

128
00:07:08,104 --> 00:07:09,772
[PROBLEM GUY]
Problem Number 6.

129
00:07:09,872 --> 00:07:14,243
Enter the appropriate
phrase in parentheses to
complete the proverb.

130
00:07:14,343 --> 00:07:15,745
(SHOYO anxious)

131
00:07:15,845 --> 00:07:19,181
[PROBLEM GUY]
The meaning is, "Even the
heartless can

132
00:07:19,281 --> 00:07:22,552
sometimes shed tears of
compassion." Fill in the blank:

133
00:07:22,652 --> 00:07:24,821
[PROBLEM GUY]
Even a demon can...

134
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:26,355
[SHOYO]
Die?!

135
00:07:26,455 --> 00:07:27,624
Uarghhh!

136
00:07:27,724 --> 00:07:29,391
[TADASHI]
Ah jeez! Poor demon!
(SHOYO confused)

137
00:07:29,491 --> 00:07:31,260
[TOBIO]
What did that demon
ever do to you Hinata?

138
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,329
[KEI]
Demons are usually
seen swinging clubs...

139
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:35,431
I can see how you
might've gotten confused.

140
00:07:35,532 --> 00:07:37,499
[SHOYO]
Gah, would you please
shut up! (seething under)

141
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,135
[KEI]
You just saw the word "demon"

142
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:40,970
and wrote down the first
thing you could think of.

143
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:42,471
You really are stupid.

144
00:07:42,572 --> 00:07:44,974
[TOBIO]
Exactly. Why don't you
use your brain for once?

145
00:07:45,074 --> 00:07:46,509
This is important.

146
00:07:46,609 --> 00:07:48,578
[SHOYO]
Why do you guys always
have to pick on me, huh!?

147
00:07:48,678 --> 00:07:51,681
[KEI]
You don't have any room
to talk though, Kageyama...

148
00:07:51,781 --> 00:07:54,183
[KEI]
I mean aren't you doing even
worse than Hinata is?

149
00:07:54,283 --> 00:07:57,620
[KEI]
You should at least start
practicing your English
vocabulary words.

150
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,622
[TOBIO]
I don't need to know no English!

151
00:07:59,722 --> 00:08:02,191
[KEI]
Oh my God you guys are
completely hopeless

152
00:08:02,291 --> 00:08:03,660
(TOBIO stunned)
[DAICHI] Kageyama.

153
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:04,627
[ALL]
Huh?

154
00:08:05,795 --> 00:08:06,663
[TOBIO]
A B‐Quick.

155
00:08:06,763 --> 00:08:08,130
(SHOYO surprised)

156
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:11,634
[TOBIO]
A... C... Time lag in front of
setter...

157
00:08:11,734 --> 00:08:17,073
Left side back row attack. D,
Parallel, Semi, Time lag behind.

158
00:08:17,173 --> 00:08:18,708
[TADASHI]
(nervous laugh) Of course.

159
00:08:18,808 --> 00:08:21,443
Perfect... When'd
you learn those?

160
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,781
[TOBIO]
Hm? The first time
I saw them... I guess.

161
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:28,317
[DAICHI]
Then I don't want to hear
you say that memorizing
words is too hard.

162
00:08:28,417 --> 00:08:29,586
(SHOYO, TADASHI, & TOBIO
dumbfounded)

163
00:08:29,686 --> 00:08:30,920
[SHOYO]
Yikes...

164
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,555
I am gonna beat you!

165
00:08:32,655 --> 00:08:35,324
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey... let's meet at
my place on Saturday.

166
00:08:35,424 --> 00:08:36,926
[YU] I'll be there!
(SHOYO eavesdropping)

167
00:08:37,026 --> 00:08:40,429
[SHOYO]
(power‐up yell) You guys
won't beat me either!

168
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,800
[KEI]
Could you please calm down and
focus on studying then?

169
00:08:45,968 --> 00:08:49,171
[CHIKARA]
Nishinoya... Can I see
that quiz from yesterday?

170
00:08:49,271 --> 00:08:51,240
[RYUNOSUKE]
Snacky time!

171
00:08:51,340 --> 00:08:54,811
[CHIKARA]
With literature, you can
usually find the answer
somewhere in the passage.

172
00:08:54,911 --> 00:08:56,813
[CHIKARA]
You just have to read carefully.

173
00:08:56,913 --> 00:08:59,782
[PROBLEM GUY]
Problem Number 3. Copy the
sentence from the passage

174
00:08:59,882 --> 00:09:04,921
[PROBLEM GUY]
that most exemplifies the two
contradictory feelings Norio
has.

175
00:09:06,422 --> 00:09:09,125
[YU]
You just have to step up
and be a man, Norio!

176
00:09:09,225 --> 00:09:12,094
[CHIKARA]
How? It says you have to choose
a sentence from the passage!

177
00:09:12,194 --> 00:09:14,463
You can't just tell Norio
whatever you want!

178
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:16,132
[RYUNOSUKE]
Norio was kinda bein' a wuss.

179
00:09:16,232 --> 00:09:19,435
I thought you said you were good
at memorizing quotes and stuff.

180
00:09:19,536 --> 00:09:21,103
[YU]
You bet I am! Like this!

181
00:09:21,203 --> 00:09:23,372
[CHIKARA]
Uh I don't think your shirt's
gonna be on the test!

182
00:09:23,472 --> 00:09:25,174
[YU] Damn...
[SAEKO] Are you
actually studying?

183
00:09:25,274 --> 00:09:27,877
(YU excited)
(ALL curious)

184
00:09:27,977 --> 00:09:29,245
[SAEKO]
Y'sick or somethin'?

185
00:09:29,345 --> 00:09:30,947
[RYUNOSUKE]
What do you mean, "are we sick?"

186
00:09:31,047 --> 00:09:32,782
[YU]
Saeko! Hey there!

187
00:09:32,882 --> 00:09:35,752
[SAEKO]
What's up, Yu? Looks
like you're stayin' cool!

188
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,053
[YU]
Thanks, I try!

189
00:09:37,153 --> 00:09:38,588
[HISASHI]
Sorry if we're uh...intruding.

190
00:09:38,688 --> 00:09:40,489
[SAEKO]
Oh no you're fine.

191
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:42,258
[SAEKO]
So why didn't you think to ask
your big sister

192
00:09:42,358 --> 00:09:44,193
to teach you, ya little punk?

193
00:09:44,293 --> 00:09:45,628
[RYUNOSUKE]
Just forget it, sis...

194
00:09:45,728 --> 00:09:47,997
You're just as stupid as
I am and we both know it.

195
00:09:48,097 --> 00:09:51,834
[SAEKO]
Obviously not, since one of us
is a college student, jerkwad.

196
00:09:51,934 --> 00:09:54,370
[RYUNOSUKE]
All you do is work and practice!

197
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,306
[SAEKO] Shut up! You don't
know what I do with my time!
[HISASHI] So that's his
sister... Makes sense.

198
00:09:57,406 --> 00:09:58,741
[KAZUHITO]
Um yeah...

199
00:09:58,841 --> 00:10:01,377
[SAEKO]
Don't come crying
to me when you fail!

200
00:10:05,014 --> 00:10:07,016
[KAZUHITO]
What does your sister
practice, exactly?

201
00:10:07,116 --> 00:10:09,318
[RYUNOSUKE]
Taiko drums. She's putting
a group together...

202
00:10:09,418 --> 00:10:11,988
[RYUNOSUKE] There's a festival
coming up pretty soon.
[SAEKO] Put your backs into it!

203
00:10:12,088 --> 00:10:13,856
[HISASHI]
Whoa, that's cool.

204
00:10:13,956 --> 00:10:15,124
[YU]
Nice outfit!

205
00:10:15,224 --> 00:10:16,793
[CHIKARA]
Okay, let's get back to work.

206
00:10:16,893 --> 00:10:17,994
We gotta get to Tokyo!

207
00:10:18,094 --> 00:10:20,296
[YU & RYUNOSUKE]
Yes sir, Professor Ennoshita
sir!

208
00:10:20,396 --> 00:10:23,666
(phone vibrating)

209
00:10:26,869 --> 00:10:30,673
[SHOYO]
Your Inter‐High prelims start
tomorrow, right? Good luck!

210
00:10:34,276 --> 00:10:37,580
(phone ringing and vibrating)

211
00:10:39,181 --> 00:10:40,750
[KENMA]
I guess it'll be all right...

212
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:44,420
You're coming here
too, aren't you?

213
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:46,589
[NATSU]
Let's go play jumpy rope!

214
00:10:46,689 --> 00:10:49,158
[SHOYO'S MOM]
Not now, Natsu, your
brother has to study!

215
00:10:49,258 --> 00:10:50,893
[NATSU]
Hmm? Aww...

216
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,567
[SHOYO]
Yeah! Tokyo, here I come!
(power yell)

217
00:10:57,667 --> 00:10:59,669
[SHOYO'S MOM]
Keep it down, Shoyo!

218
00:11:03,172 --> 00:11:05,474
[TEACHER A]
Tanaka from class 1's doing a
lot better now;

219
00:11:05,575 --> 00:11:09,512
[TEACHER A]
not only does he stay awake in
class but he actually wants to
ask questions!

220
00:11:09,612 --> 00:11:14,917
[TEACHER B]
Same goes for Nishinoya
from class 3! They can
do this if they try!

221
00:11:15,017 --> 00:11:18,420
[TAKEDA, internal]
Maybe we really CAN make that
trip to Tokyo!

222
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:20,757
[TAKEDA, internal]
That just leaves Kiyoko's part.

223
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:23,860
[TAKEDA]
I wonder if she was
able to do it?

224
00:11:25,562 --> 00:11:27,864
[KIYOKO]
Excuse me... Could I speak with
you, please?

225
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:33,069
[TAKEDA]
I wonder if she found
a new manager?

226
00:11:53,723 --> 00:11:55,925
[HITOKA, internal]
(flustered) She's cute...

227
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:58,895
[KIYOKO] During Inter‐High
preliminaries last year...
[HITOKA, internal] A gorgeous
third‐year girl.

228
00:11:58,995 --> 00:12:02,832
[KIYOKO] we were neck‐and‐neck
for a while with Aoba Johsai...
[HITOKA, internal]
That beauty mark near her lip

229
00:12:02,932 --> 00:12:06,335
[KIYOKO] They can be a bunch of
troublemakers sometimes...
[HITOKA, internal]
Oh wow, and her hair is

230
00:12:06,435 --> 00:12:09,506
[KIYOKO] But I think we're the
kind of team people want to root
for y'know.
[HITOKA, internal] (gasp)

231
00:12:09,606 --> 00:12:13,042
[KIYOKO]
Whaddya say... why don't you
just try it out for a little
while?

232
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:14,310
[HITOKA]
(startled) Okay!

233
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:16,713
[KIYOKO]
(gasp) Really? Thank you!

234
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:19,081
[KIYOKO]
I'll come get you
right after school!

235
00:12:22,118 --> 00:12:23,720
(HITOKA stunned)

236
00:12:25,154 --> 00:12:27,624
[SHOYO]
You found a new person?
That's so awesome!

237
00:12:27,724 --> 00:12:29,859
(HITOKA startled) (nervous)

238
00:12:29,959 --> 00:12:32,094
[RYUNOSUKE] Hey beautiful.
[YU] Who's that?

239
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:33,229
(HITOKA distressed)

240
00:12:33,329 --> 00:12:34,631
[KIYOKO]
Well, team...

241
00:12:34,731 --> 00:12:36,899
I'd like you to meet your
potential new manager.

242
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:41,538
[HITOKA]
Um... my name is Yachi!

243
00:12:42,271 --> 00:12:43,305
(DAICHI excited)

244
00:12:43,405 --> 00:12:44,707
[KOSHI]
It's so great to meet you!

245
00:12:44,807 --> 00:12:46,408
[SHOYO]
Nice job, Kiyoko!

246
00:12:46,509 --> 00:12:47,476
[TADASHI, internal]
She's pretty.

247
00:12:47,577 --> 00:12:49,011
[ASAHI]
You a first‐year?

248
00:12:49,111 --> 00:12:52,014
[HITOKA]
(shriek) Uh yes.. Yes, I'm in
class 1‐5, sir!

249
00:12:52,114 --> 00:12:54,450
[TOBIO & KEI] Sir?
[DAICHI] Give her
some space, Asahi!

250
00:12:54,551 --> 00:12:56,018
[ASAHI]
Huh?

251
00:12:56,118 --> 00:12:57,654
(HITOKA distressed)

252
00:12:57,754 --> 00:13:00,422
[KOSHI]
Huh? uh... Stop it. You're
staring at her, it's creepy!

253
00:13:00,523 --> 00:13:03,660
[ASAHI]
This is really great news! Now
you've got a manager for next
year.

254
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:05,628
[SHOYO] Yeah!
(HITOKA fumbling, quivering)

255
00:13:05,728 --> 00:13:07,196
[KIYOKO]
Well, it's not set in stone...

256
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,431
[KIYOKO]
I asked her today at the very
last minute,

257
00:13:09,532 --> 00:13:12,434
[KIYOKO]
so she's just dropping by on her
way to do some of her committee
work.

258
00:13:12,535 --> 00:13:16,372
[KIYOKO] But she wanted
to come meet you all.
[HITOKA] Y‐Yeah, it's
very nice to meet you!

259
00:13:16,472 --> 00:13:18,140
[ALL] Hello!
(HITOKA panicked)

260
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:21,243
[KIYOKO]
Easy, don't crowd her; she's not
used to you guys yet.

261
00:13:21,343 --> 00:13:22,478
[ALL]
Hm?

262
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:25,347
[HITOKA]
Um... Sorry for bothering you!

263
00:13:25,447 --> 00:13:30,252
[DAICHI]
Kiyoko... I had no idea that you
were out looking for a manager
for next year.

264
00:13:30,352 --> 00:13:35,257
[KIYOKO]
Yeah well. I didn't feel like
all the searching I did back in
the spring was enough.

265
00:13:35,357 --> 00:13:38,360
[KIYOKO]
In order for Karasuno's team
to continue to grow stronger...

266
00:13:38,460 --> 00:13:42,732
[KIYOKO]
it's very important that I pass
on my responsibilities after I
graduate.

267
00:13:42,832 --> 00:13:46,503
(RYUNOSUKE, KOSHI, & YU sobbing)
[DAICHI] Oh, Kiyoko!

268
00:13:46,603 --> 00:13:48,571
[RYUNOSUKE & YU]
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH, KIYOKOOOO!

269
00:13:48,671 --> 00:13:52,274
[HITOKA, internal]
(terrified) Who knew those guys
were so tall and intimidating?

270
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,343
I don't think I can come back!

271
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:57,947
Oh God! I stood next to that hot
girl for almost 2 whole minutes!

272
00:13:58,047 --> 00:14:00,817
[HITOKA] What if I get killed
by one of her admirers?!
[FANGIRL] Die!

273
00:14:00,917 --> 00:14:06,823
(HITOKA nervous flitting)

274
00:14:06,923 --> 00:14:08,991
[KEISHIN]
(confused) You all right?

275
00:14:09,091 --> 00:14:10,827
(HITOKA terrified)

276
00:14:12,061 --> 00:14:13,229
(HITOKA scared)

277
00:14:13,329 --> 00:14:17,066
[HITOKA]
Who's this tough guy?!
Is he a fan of hers?!

278
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,268
[HITOKA]
(scared) PLEASE DON'T KILL
MEEEEE!

279
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:23,005
[KEISHIN]
(shocked) Um... kill you?

280
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:25,708
(bell ringing)
[STUDENT C] Man, I'm starved!

281
00:14:25,808 --> 00:14:27,510
[STUDENT D]
Let's go to Sakanoshita.

282
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,381
[KEI]
Tutoring sessions are
only before and after
practice. Beat it.

283
00:14:32,481 --> 00:14:35,618
[SHOYO]
(grunt) Come on! Mr. Yoshida's
not here and I need to‐

284
00:14:35,718 --> 00:14:39,455
[KEI]
Terribly sorry, but you'll have
to come back during my regular
business hours.

285
00:14:39,556 --> 00:14:40,623
(SHOYO frustrated)

286
00:14:40,723 --> 00:14:42,759
[SHOYO]
Psh, Tsukishima,

287
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,894
more like Sucky‐shima!

288
00:14:44,994 --> 00:14:46,963
[SHOYO]
What're we gonna do?

289
00:14:47,063 --> 00:14:48,931
[TADASHI] Hinata!
[SHOYO] Hm?

290
00:14:49,031 --> 00:14:51,167
Hey, can you please
help me with English?

291
00:14:51,267 --> 00:14:54,103
Oh sorry... I'm
kinda terrible
at English.
(disheartened)

292
00:14:54,203 --> 00:14:57,173
Oh but hey... That
new first‐year manager
girl we just met.

293
00:14:57,273 --> 00:15:00,409
[TADASHI]
She's in class 5, so I bet her
grades are pretty good.

294
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:03,713
Oh, that's right! Classes 4
and 5 are for college prep!

295
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:09,351
[HITOKA, internal]
(sipping juice box) What should
I do after school? Guess I could
go back...

296
00:15:09,451 --> 00:15:11,621
[SHOYO]
Hey, Yachi!

297
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,122
[SHOYO]
Sorry to bug you.

298
00:15:13,222 --> 00:15:15,758
[HITOKA]
Huh?! It's the volleyball guys!

299
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:18,494
[HITOKA, internal]
What do they want?! Oh god,
I don't remember their names!

300
00:15:18,595 --> 00:15:21,097
[HITOKA]
Did they TELL me their names?!
Ahhh, what do I do?!

301
00:15:21,197 --> 00:15:26,035
[HITOKA]
What kind of future can
I have if I can't remember
people's names?!

302
00:15:26,135 --> 00:15:28,270
[SUPERVISOR] You're
terrible with names!
[HITOKA] Argh!

303
00:15:28,370 --> 00:15:31,107
[HITOKA]
I'll lose my job and end
up homeless...

304
00:15:31,207 --> 00:15:35,177
eating garbage...
Selling my organs!
(CAT snarls and hisses)

305
00:15:35,277 --> 00:15:37,714
[SHOYO]
Anyway, my name's Shoyo Hinata.

306
00:15:37,814 --> 00:15:39,682
[HITOKA] Huh?
[SHOYO] And this is Kageyama.

307
00:15:39,782 --> 00:15:41,818
[TOBIO] Hello there.
[HITOKA] Uh, hi.

308
00:15:41,918 --> 00:15:43,753
[SHOYO]
Do you enjoy studying, Yachi?

309
00:15:43,853 --> 00:15:46,288
[HITOKA]
Uh... Well, I don't hate it,
but...

310
00:15:46,388 --> 00:15:50,960
[SHOYO]
It'd be great if you could help
us with English... Wouldn't it,
Kageyama?

311
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:52,428
[TOBIO]
If you don't mind.

312
00:15:52,529 --> 00:15:54,363
[SHOYO]
If we fail our exams next month,

313
00:15:54,463 --> 00:15:56,398
we can't take the trip to Tokyo!

314
00:15:56,498 --> 00:16:00,402
[SHOYO]
So we've had that four‐eyed
bully jerk‐face Tsukishima
tutoring us 'til now.

315
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:02,071
[KEI]
Why is this so hard for you?

316
00:16:02,171 --> 00:16:03,906
[SHOYO]
But now he's getting really
irritated with us

317
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:05,307
because we're too stupid, so...!

318
00:16:05,407 --> 00:16:07,176
[TOBIO]
Jeez, Hinata, he's
not THAT bad is he.

319
00:16:07,276 --> 00:16:09,478
[SHOYO]
Fine, but wouldn't you rather
have a NICE teacher?!

320
00:16:09,579 --> 00:16:12,849
[HITOKA] I... can if you
want me to... (startled)
[SHOYO] Really?!

321
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:18,855
[HITOKA]
Sure! But I'm sorry if I'm not
any nicer to you than the
Four‐Eyed Bully jerk‐face guy...

322
00:16:18,955 --> 00:16:21,057
[SHOYO]
I wouldn't worry about that.

323
00:16:21,157 --> 00:16:24,594
[SHOYO]
Wow, I get it now! You're
awesome at this!

324
00:16:24,694 --> 00:16:26,629
[HITOKA]
Oh no, it's nothing...
(nervous laugh)

325
00:16:26,729 --> 00:16:30,567
[SHOYO]
Your notes are so easy to read!
And I like your drawings too.

326
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:35,004
Yeah, my mother runs a design
company, so she's really picky
about details like that.

327
00:16:35,104 --> 00:16:38,908
[HITOKA]
Oh, it's better if you leave a
blank space right here so you
can write in it later...

328
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:43,012
[HITOKA]
And it's easier to keep track if
you only use a few colors... and
then you‐

329
00:16:43,112 --> 00:16:45,748
[HITOKA]
(gasp) I'm sorry! I drew all
over your stuff!

330
00:16:45,848 --> 00:16:48,184
[SHOYO]
Wow, this is making perfect
sense to me now.

331
00:16:48,284 --> 00:16:52,388
[HITOKA]
Oh... I‐I'm glad I could help
you out.. heh...

332
00:16:52,488 --> 00:16:53,690
[HITOKA]
So, uh Hyena...

333
00:16:53,790 --> 00:16:54,924
[SHOYO]
It's Hinata!

334
00:16:55,024 --> 00:16:57,093
[HITOKA]
Hinata. Do you like to study?

335
00:16:57,193 --> 00:17:01,030
[SHOYO]
Yeah no... I can't stand sitting
still for that long.

336
00:17:01,130 --> 00:17:04,734
[HITOKA]
So you're just working hard
because you really want to go on
that Tokyo trip?

337
00:17:04,834 --> 00:17:08,671
[SHOYO]
Uh‐huh! Because we get to play
practice matches with a buncha
good teams there!

338
00:17:08,771 --> 00:17:10,807
[HITOKA]
That's really cool...

339
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:14,577
I don't think I've ever put
everything I had into something
like that before.

340
00:17:14,677 --> 00:17:18,480
[SHOYO]
There's this school called
Nekoma High and their setter
is some kind of genius!

341
00:17:18,581 --> 00:17:21,450
[SHOYO]
Plus they've got this
evil‐looking captain; with a
rooster head!

342
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:25,021
[SHOYO]
He's a crazy evil good receiver,
so no matter what kind of combos
we throw at him,

343
00:17:25,121 --> 00:17:27,323
[SHOYO]
he goes like "bwaaah,
I don't think so!"

344
00:17:27,423 --> 00:17:29,859
[TOBIO]
And they've got an impressive
libero too... He's a good match
for Nishinoya.

345
00:17:29,959 --> 00:17:35,297
[SHOYO] Yeah, there's a lot of
good players! And not just in
Tokyo.
[HITOKA, internal] Setter?

346
00:17:35,397 --> 00:17:40,603
[SHOYO]
Our prefecture has the Great
King from Aoba‐Johsai, as well
as the absolute champ Ushiwaka..

347
00:17:40,703 --> 00:17:43,773
[SHOYO]
and then there's Date Tech's
Iron Wall who stand at 6 foot 3!

348
00:17:43,873 --> 00:17:49,311
[HITOKA] Oh wow, that is super
tall! Does that... mean you're
like the manager?
[SHOYO] Huh? Why?

349
00:17:49,411 --> 00:17:53,215
[HITOKA]
It's just, I thought only tall
people played volleyball.

350
00:17:53,315 --> 00:17:55,885
And most of the guys on our
team are pretty tall...

351
00:17:55,985 --> 00:18:00,489
[SHOYO]
(stunned) Oh no! I AM short...
but I'm still a starter, at
least for now!

352
00:18:00,590 --> 00:18:04,293
[HITOKA, internal]
Oh my gosh! I can't believe
I judged him by his appearance!

353
00:18:04,393 --> 00:18:05,762
[HITOKA]
I'm sorry!

354
00:18:05,862 --> 00:18:07,864
[SHOYO]
It's cool, I'm used to it.

355
00:18:07,964 --> 00:18:09,365
[SHOYO]
I may not be tall...

356
00:18:09,465 --> 00:18:10,800
(HITOKA question)

357
00:18:11,534 --> 00:18:13,035
[SHOYO]
... but I can fly!

358
00:18:14,236 --> 00:18:15,538
(HITOKA touched)

359
00:18:15,638 --> 00:18:18,975
[TOBIO]
Hinata... Don't forget to copy
this part down.

360
00:18:19,075 --> 00:18:20,910
[SHOYO]
Oh, okay.

361
00:18:22,411 --> 00:18:24,747
[SHOYO]
Those guys are all
bigger than me...

362
00:18:24,847 --> 00:18:27,449
But... When I'm in a game...

363
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,620
it's like I'm a hero fighting
against my enemies...

364
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,790
I get so pumped...
I feel invincible.

365
00:18:33,890 --> 00:18:37,459
[HITOKA]
That's impressive... You really
have a lot of passion don't you.

366
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:41,063
[HITOKA]
So I guess that makes you some
kind of tiny giant.

367
00:18:41,163 --> 00:18:42,799
(SHOYO shocked)
(HITOKA startled)

368
00:18:42,899 --> 00:18:44,701
[SHOYO]
Wait.. You know about
the Tiny Giant?

369
00:18:44,801 --> 00:18:47,537
[HITOKA]
Um... well it's just that uh...

370
00:18:47,637 --> 00:18:50,507
[HITOKA]
when they play sports on TV, if
there's a Japanese guy

371
00:18:50,607 --> 00:18:53,175
[HITOKA]
who's really talented but
smaller than all the other
athletes,

372
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:55,745
they call him the tiny
giant... or something.

373
00:18:55,845 --> 00:19:01,483
[SHOYO]
Oh... okay... Yeah! Then I am
gonna be the next Tiny Giant!

374
00:19:01,584 --> 00:19:06,723
[TOBIO]
Hey... If you want to do that,
you have to get to Tokyo... Get
your ass to work.

375
00:19:06,823 --> 00:19:08,090
(SHOYO shocked)

376
00:19:09,091 --> 00:19:10,660
[SHOYO]
Can we do this again sometime?

377
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,830
[HITOKA]
Mhmm... The best way to learn is
by teaching, right?

378
00:19:13,930 --> 00:19:17,800
[SHOYO] Wow, Yachi... Thanks so
much! You're the greatest!
(HITOKA shaken about)

379
00:19:17,900 --> 00:19:20,737
[SHOYO]
Bye! See you at practice,
okaaaay?

380
00:19:20,837 --> 00:19:29,145
[HITOKA]
(nervous giggle) What is my
problem? Feels like I've been in
direct sunlight for too long.

381
00:19:32,048 --> 00:19:35,384
(school bell rings)

382
00:19:38,888 --> 00:19:40,156
(HITOKA shy)

383
00:19:40,256 --> 00:19:41,858
[SHOYO] Yachi!
(HITOKA startled)

384
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:43,292
[SHOYO]
We had a quiz in English today,

385
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,094
and there were questions from
what you taught me!

386
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:47,263
[SHOYO]
I got almost whole
third of them right!

387
00:19:47,363 --> 00:19:48,464
(HITOKA excited)

388
00:19:48,565 --> 00:19:51,233
[HITOKA & SHOYO] Woohoo!
[HITOKA] Nice job, Hyena!

389
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:53,670
[KOSHI] Goodness, that
Hinata sure does have
a way with people.
[SHOYO] I told you, it's Hinata!

390
00:19:53,770 --> 00:19:56,372
[KOSHI] Doesn't he? I mean he's
already friends with her.
[HITOKA] Just Hinata!

391
00:19:56,472 --> 00:20:00,743
[KIYOKO] You can just observe
for today... There's no reason
for you to be nervous.
(DAICHI leading stretches)

392
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:03,680
[HITOKA] Right!
[KIYOKO] Hmph.

393
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,315
[KIYOKO]
Oh! Anyway, be sure to watch out
for the strays, okay?

394
00:20:06,415 --> 00:20:08,985
[HITOKA]
Okay! (internal) Strays?

395
00:20:09,085 --> 00:20:11,754
[HITOKA, internal]
Stray what?! Bullets?!

396
00:20:11,854 --> 00:20:12,755
[KEISHIN]
You okay, kid?

397
00:20:12,855 --> 00:20:14,056
(HITOKA startled)

398
00:20:14,156 --> 00:20:17,459
(nervous) (mortified)

399
00:20:17,560 --> 00:20:21,197
[HITOKA]
You're the bad guy from
yesterday! Are you gonna
kill me?! (whimpering)

400
00:20:21,297 --> 00:20:24,867
[KEISHIN]
Uhh... listen, I...
I'm just the coach...

401
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:29,105
[HITOKA, internal]
Oh god! I judged someone based
on their appearance again!

402
00:20:29,205 --> 00:20:31,407
[HITOKA]
I'M SORRY! I'm so sorry...

403
00:20:31,508 --> 00:20:32,942
(KEISHIN shocked)

404
00:20:33,042 --> 00:20:34,476
[RYUNOSUKE]
Left!

405
00:20:36,513 --> 00:20:37,514
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah!

406
00:20:37,614 --> 00:20:38,815
[ASAHI]
Nice, Tanaka!

407
00:20:38,915 --> 00:20:40,282
[KEISHIN]
Don't leave any room, blockers!

408
00:20:40,382 --> 00:20:42,151
[TADASHI] Sir!
[KEISHIN] Heads up!

409
00:20:42,251 --> 00:20:43,820
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huah! Sorry, bro!

410
00:20:43,920 --> 00:20:45,522
[KEISHIN] Talk to each other!
[ASAHI] Left!

411
00:20:45,622 --> 00:20:47,023
[YU]
Double block!

412
00:20:48,024 --> 00:20:52,028
(HITOKA gasp) (confounded)

413
00:20:52,128 --> 00:20:53,395
[KOSHI]
Good one, Hinata!

414
00:20:53,495 --> 00:20:55,698
[TADASHI] My bad!
[KIYOKO] Are you all right?

415
00:20:55,798 --> 00:20:57,634
[HITOKA]
(snaps out of it) Yes ma'am!

416
00:20:57,734 --> 00:21:00,837
It's just that I've never
watched a volleyball game this
close to the court...

417
00:21:00,937 --> 00:21:02,304
[HITOKA]
It's so powerful!

418
00:21:02,404 --> 00:21:03,940
[KIYOKO]
Well, when it comes
to offense...

419
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:06,042
I think we're probably
the best team around.

420
00:21:06,142 --> 00:21:07,744
[HITOKA] (gasp) Whoa...
[SHOYO] Sorry!

421
00:21:07,844 --> 00:21:09,846
[RYUNOSUKE]
Ahhh... Kiyoko's talking...

422
00:21:09,946 --> 00:21:12,281
Her mouth is moving...
And she's smiling, too!

423
00:21:12,381 --> 00:21:14,817
[YU]
They're having some girl talk!
That's so cute...

424
00:21:14,917 --> 00:21:17,319
[KEISHIN]
WE'RE gonna have a talk if you
don't stop acting like that!

425
00:21:17,419 --> 00:21:19,589
(YU & RYUNOSUKE shout in pain)
(KIYOKO soft laugh)

426
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,891
[KIYOKO] We used to be
strong... Years ago,
[KEISHIN] Now get ready
for the next play!

427
00:21:21,991 --> 00:21:23,926
[KIYOKO] we made it into
the national championships.
[YU & RYUNOSUKE] Yes sir!

428
00:21:24,026 --> 00:21:27,229
[HITOKA] Really?
[KIYOKO] Yeah, but these days
it's a little different.

429
00:21:27,329 --> 00:21:31,033
In fact, now people have been
calling us the Wingless Crows.

430
00:21:36,305 --> 00:21:39,709
[KIYOKO]
But this year.... We're
going to make it back.

431
00:21:41,544 --> 00:21:46,683
I see... Amazing...
These guys are so talented!

432
00:21:46,783 --> 00:21:48,084
[KIYOKO]
Huh?

433
00:21:48,651 --> 00:21:50,352
[DAICHI]
Time out!

434
00:21:50,452 --> 00:21:53,623
[TAKEDA]
So... you'll be glad to know we
just got a last‐minute request

435
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:56,693
[TAKEDA]
for a practice match tomorrow
against Ougi West High School.

436
00:21:56,793 --> 00:22:01,564
[TAKEDA]
I said yes. They were impressed
with our performance at the
Inter‐High prelims.

437
00:22:01,664 --> 00:22:03,265
(TADASHI, DAICHI, KOSHI,
& SHOYO excited)

438
00:22:03,365 --> 00:22:05,067
It's important for us to
remember the disappointment

439
00:22:05,167 --> 00:22:07,904
of losing to Seijoh...
But still...

440
00:22:08,004 --> 00:22:12,542
[KEISHIN]
There's no need to dwell on that
feeling right now. Just focus on
winning!

441
00:22:12,642 --> 00:22:15,211
(KURASUNO rejoicing)
[KEISHIN] Settle down!

442
00:22:15,311 --> 00:22:17,146
[SHOYO]
Does Ougi West have a good
volleyball team?

443
00:22:17,246 --> 00:22:18,581
[TOBIO]
Doesn't matter,
we'll bring 'em down.

444
00:22:18,681 --> 00:22:20,850
[RYUNOSUKE]
They won't even know
what hit 'em!

445
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:24,053
(HITOKA anxious breathing)

446
00:23:55,277 --> 00:23:58,347
[RYUNOSUKE]
Ever since that new girl
got here, Kiyoko's been
way different.

447
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,917
[YU]
Maybe she's quiet with us
because we're all guys!

448
00:24:01,017 --> 00:24:04,386
[RYUNOSUKE]
Omigod, Noya, like, let's work
on our feminine sides!

449
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:06,188
[YU]
Like, okay girlfriend!

450
00:24:06,288 --> 00:24:09,726
[KIYOKO]
(groaning) Next Haikyu!!
