1
00:00:04,438 --> 00:00:08,543
(pre‐game chatter)

2
00:00:09,944 --> 00:00:12,113
[MAN] Can I have a program?
[GIRL] Sure.

3
00:00:12,213 --> 00:00:17,318
[CHANTS]
Go, go, Dewa First! Push, push,
Dewa First! Go, go, Dewa First!
Push, push, Dewa First!

4
00:00:17,418 --> 00:00:19,053
[PLAYER]
Serve it up!

5
00:00:19,153 --> 00:00:21,756
[STUDENT A] That's them.
You know, Karasuno.
[STUDENT B] Karasuno?

6
00:00:21,856 --> 00:00:26,728
[STUDENT A]
Back at the Inter‐High
prelims... That team went full
sets with Aoba‐Johsai...

7
00:00:26,828 --> 00:00:30,264
[STUDENT A] These guys had
them down to the wire.
[STUDENT B] Oh, no joke?!

8
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,601
[STUDENT A]
Supposedly, they have that
guy from Kitagawa First,

9
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:34,969
[STUDENT A] "The King
of the Court".
[TOBIO] So do you know which ref
we'll have?

10
00:00:35,069 --> 00:00:37,672
[STUDENT C] I hear they also
have Nishinoya from Chidori‐yama
Middle School.
[STUDENT B]

11
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:40,008
[STUDENT A]
Right. And other than him,
there was another guy

12
00:00:40,108 --> 00:00:44,345
who received almost all the
serves directly from Oikawa.
I think he was their captain.

13
00:00:44,445 --> 00:00:49,651
[STUDENT B]
Weird. Karasuno doesn't really
look all that big to me. I mean,
They're pretty small, right.

14
00:00:49,751 --> 00:00:52,486
[STUDENT A]
I think there's a guy close to
6'3" on the team.

15
00:00:52,587 --> 00:00:55,557
Though I don't think he did
all that much during the
preliminaries.

16
00:00:55,657 --> 00:00:58,627
[STUDENT A]
Well, I know the two guys on
their left side are scary.

17
00:00:58,727 --> 00:01:01,329
[STUDENT A]
They look like they could be
some power spikers.

18
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:03,932
But, the most important
thing about Karasuno...

19
00:01:04,032 --> 00:01:06,467
[STUDENT A]
...their team manager
is a total fox!

20
00:01:06,568 --> 00:01:11,139
[KIYOKO] Yachi, I'm sorry that
you have to cheer from all the
way up here.
[STUDENT B]

21
00:01:11,239 --> 00:01:13,141
[STUDENT A]
And, of course, you know,
there's him.

22
00:01:13,241 --> 00:01:14,876
[STUDENT A]
The little middle blocker who

23
00:01:14,976 --> 00:01:17,679
lands all those ridiculous
quick‐attacks.

24
00:01:17,779 --> 00:01:20,549
[STUDENT A]
Karasuno's No.10.

25
00:01:20,649 --> 00:01:23,417
[STUDENT A]
Ugh. Looks like he's
sick or something.

26
00:01:23,518 --> 00:01:26,020
[HITOKA]
Uh... Hinata, are you
feeling alright?

27
00:01:26,120 --> 00:01:30,725
[SHOYO]
Yeah I'm fine, I'm okay. I puked
on the way here, so I'm feeling
a little better now.

28
00:01:30,825 --> 00:01:34,529
[KEI]
Eating tons of katsu bowls so
early in the morning is bound to
make you sick.

29
00:01:34,629 --> 00:01:37,198
[SHOYO]
On match days, it's good luck
to eat katsu isn't it?

30
00:01:37,298 --> 00:01:39,000
[KEI]
What the hell are you
talking about...?

31
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,302
[TOBIO]
You moron! Hinata,
you're a moron!

32
00:01:41,402 --> 00:01:44,438
[DAICHI]
Kageyama. Your library of
insults could use some variety.

33
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:48,009
[TOBIO] (flustered) I‐I'll do my
best to increase my vocabulary!
[HITOKA] I have something that
might help your tummy!

34
00:01:48,109 --> 00:01:51,245
[TADASHI] (queasy) Just thinking
about Hinata's puke makes me
want to puke myself...
[SHOYO] Oh, thanks!

35
00:01:51,345 --> 00:01:53,515
[KEI]
Huh? Then go to
the bathroom then!

36
00:01:53,615 --> 00:01:57,451
[ASAHI]
Me too, I've got a lot of
anxiety right now... (heaves)

37
00:01:57,552 --> 00:01:59,120
[KOSHI]
I thought you were
concentrating,

38
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,955
but all you were doing was
holding back your puke?!

39
00:02:01,055 --> 00:02:04,125
[YU]
Hinata. Is this really the
second time you've thrown up
on the bus?

40
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,827
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah but I'd like
to make the point

41
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:08,462
that this time around you didn't
blow chunks on anyone's crotch.

42
00:02:08,563 --> 00:02:10,932
[RYUNOSUKE]
My little boy's
growing up so fast!

43
00:02:11,032 --> 00:02:12,734
(YU & RYUNOSUKE cracking up)

44
00:02:12,834 --> 00:02:14,202
[STUDENT B]
I don't know, I'm not sure.

45
00:02:14,302 --> 00:02:17,639
Did these guys really
force Seijoh into a corner?

46
00:03:52,266 --> 00:03:56,070
[SHOYO, singing]
Bath‐room, bath‐room,
I gotsta pee.

47
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:59,140
I'm gonna sprinkle all my
tinkle in the hoity‐

48
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,942
[SHOYO]
Oh, sorry about that‐

49
00:04:01,042 --> 00:04:02,310
[TOWADA]
Watch where you're going,
pipsqueak?!

50
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:04,979
[SHOYO]
(frightened) I'm sorry,
I'm sorry!

51
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:08,016
[SHOYO]
Oh? Wait a second...
Ohgi Minami?

52
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:11,853
That's the team we're going up
against in our first match!
They won their first round!

53
00:04:11,953 --> 00:04:15,289
[TOWADA] Wait? You must
be in middle school.
[SHOYO] Oh?

54
00:04:15,389 --> 00:04:17,325
[TOWADA]
Ah, sorry if I scared you
there, little man.

55
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:19,493
[TOWADA]
Are you here to cheer for your
big brother or something?

56
00:04:19,594 --> 00:04:22,296
[TOWADA]
Hm? My little brother's got a
t‐shirt just like that,

57
00:04:22,396 --> 00:04:24,198
it's like his favorite shirt
in the whole world.

58
00:04:24,298 --> 00:04:28,169
[SHOYO]
Gah! I‐I'm a first year at
Karasuno High School! I'm Shoyo
Hinata!

59
00:04:28,269 --> 00:04:34,543
[SHOYO]
We're winning this tournament
and go to nationals! (heavy
panting)

60
00:04:34,643 --> 00:04:38,146
[TOWADA] Huh? Karasuno?
(SHOYO scared)

61
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:41,349
[TOWADA]
Don't talk like getting to
nationals is so easy.

62
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:43,618
[SHOYO]
Huh? But I'm telling
you the truth.

63
00:04:43,718 --> 00:04:45,687
[TOWADA]
Oh shut up, you little‐ (shock)

64
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:51,225
[SHOYO]
We're gonna beat everyone...
and go to Tokyo.

65
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,829
[TOWADA]
Heh! Look even if that were to
miraculously happen...

66
00:04:54,929 --> 00:04:59,333
[TOWADA] You would only
end up being crushed by
Shiratorizawa anyway.
[SHOYO] Huh?

67
00:04:59,433 --> 00:05:02,303
[TOWADA]
But we can at least have fun
until then, right?

68
00:05:02,837 --> 00:05:04,372
(SHOYO question)

69
00:05:05,106 --> 00:05:07,308
(long whistle)

70
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,111
[DAICHI]
The game before us is over.
Ready guys?!

71
00:05:10,211 --> 00:05:12,681
[KURASUNO]
Let's goooo!

72
00:05:12,781 --> 00:05:13,915
[TAZAWA]
Whatever, idiot.

73
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:15,249
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh?

74
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:18,086
(RYUNOSUKE & SHOYO frightened)

75
00:05:18,186 --> 00:05:20,154
[RYUNOSUKE]
Dude. Just look at these guys.

76
00:05:20,254 --> 00:05:22,356
They must do their recruiting
at the local jail.

77
00:05:22,456 --> 00:05:25,694
[KOSHI]
You of all people would say
that? And stop with that face.

78
00:05:25,794 --> 00:05:28,096
(long whistle)

79
00:05:29,097 --> 00:05:30,264
[TOBIO]
Nice kill!

80
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:32,300
[OYASU]
Shaved heads are seriously lame.

81
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,803
Dude, do you have
lice or something

82
00:05:34,903 --> 00:05:39,541
[RYUNOSUKE]
I shall proceed. I offer
you my best regards.

83
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:43,545
[RYUNOSUKE]
Take that, goddammit!

84
00:05:44,345 --> 00:05:46,214
[TOBIO]
Nice kill!

85
00:05:46,314 --> 00:05:47,949
[RYUNOSUKE]
I apologize for that outburst.

86
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,851
[TOBIO]
Huh... Mmm...

87
00:05:51,119 --> 00:05:53,855
(KURASUNO compliments
towards Hinata)

88
00:05:53,955 --> 00:05:57,125
[STUDENT D]
Looks like everyone on Karasuno
has amazing attack power.

89
00:05:57,225 --> 00:05:58,760
(TOWADA concerned)

90
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,195
(long whistle)

91
00:06:08,102 --> 00:06:13,708
[HITOKA]
Spring Nationals volleyball.
For Karasuno High School, this
is just the beginning...

92
00:06:13,808 --> 00:06:14,876
(whistle)

93
00:06:14,976 --> 00:06:16,144
[EVERYONE]
Thank you for the game!

94
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:17,546
[HITOKA]
The beginning of their battles!

95
00:06:17,646 --> 00:06:19,681
[CHANTS]
Go, go, let's go,
let's go, Kaji High!

96
00:06:19,781 --> 00:06:21,916
[KEISHIN]
All right. I know their
third‐years have already
left the team,

97
00:06:22,016 --> 00:06:24,285
but their backbone's always
been their second‐years.

98
00:06:24,385 --> 00:06:28,623
They won the first round of this
tournament in straight sets as
well. So play smart.

99
00:06:28,723 --> 00:06:31,793
[KEISHIN] And be careful
of No.1 on their left!
[KURASUNO] Yessir!

100
00:06:31,893 --> 00:06:34,495
From the end of the
Inter‐High prelims until now,

101
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:37,098
you have tried things
you were not used to.

102
00:06:37,198 --> 00:06:40,669
[TAKEDA]
They didn't always mesh,
and you lost roughly 70
of your matches

103
00:06:40,769 --> 00:06:43,471
[TAKEDA] against the
Kanto powerhouses.
(ALL shamed)

104
00:06:43,572 --> 00:06:49,277
[TAKEDA]
But, the new weapons that were
nothing but failures at first,
are now starting to take shape.

105
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:54,783
Now go out there and get a
victory... Balance out all
of those frustrations.

106
00:06:54,883 --> 00:06:56,585
[KURASUNO]
Yessir!

107
00:06:56,685 --> 00:06:59,453
[DAICHI] Karasuno, fight!
[KURASUNO] Fiiight!
[HITOKA] Fiiight!

108
00:06:59,554 --> 00:07:02,724
[OHNO]
Oh, well well, look who's here.
Good to see you, Coach.

109
00:07:02,824 --> 00:07:06,127
[UKAI] Yeah.
[OHNO] I suppose you're
here to see your grandson.

110
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:07,529
[UKAI]
No, that's not the only reason!

111
00:07:07,629 --> 00:07:09,463
[HITOKA]
Uh wait? Grandson?

112
00:07:09,564 --> 00:07:11,432
[OGASAWARA]
Hey uh, you're from
Karasuno, right?

113
00:07:11,533 --> 00:07:12,967
Why aren't you down
by the court?

114
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:15,203
[HITOKA]
(annoyed) Only one team
manager is allowed

115
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:19,140
[HITOKA] to be on the bench!
So I'm watching here.
[AYA] Oh... Look, there's Sho!

116
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,976
[OGASAWARA] What? Where?
Oh yeah! I see him!
[OHNO]
This is the first time

117
00:07:22,076 --> 00:07:24,412
[HITOKA] Sho? Oh, they're
talking about Hinata...
[OHNO]
They've got an amazing couple

118
00:07:24,513 --> 00:07:26,948
[OHNO]
Karasuno might actually go
pretty far this year.

119
00:07:27,048 --> 00:07:29,718
[UKAI]
There is never a match that you
are destined to lose,

120
00:07:29,818 --> 00:07:32,521
nor is there a match you
are certain to win either.

121
00:07:32,621 --> 00:07:36,024
[UKAI]
The slightest difference
in condition, anxiety,
impatience...

122
00:07:36,124 --> 00:07:39,393
[UKAI]
Even with the most powerful
team, the players are still
human.

123
00:07:39,493 --> 00:07:44,733
[UKAI]
It doesn't take much. The most
trivial of disturbances can trip
anyone up.

124
00:07:45,934 --> 00:07:48,637
I wonder... Will Karasuno
get tripped up today?

125
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:50,872
[YU]
Make it a good one, Asahi!

126
00:07:50,972 --> 00:07:53,508
(ASAHI exhales) (whistle)

127
00:08:00,114 --> 00:08:01,783
(whistle)
(YOKOTE & KARAMATSU stunned)

128
00:08:01,883 --> 00:08:03,952
(TOWADA stunned)
(ball bouncing to a standstill)

129
00:08:04,052 --> 00:08:07,021
(ALL amazed)
(KURASUNO celebrates)

130
00:08:07,121 --> 00:08:10,458
[HITOKA] They did it!
That was incredible!
[OHNO] They're starting
off with a service ace!

131
00:08:10,559 --> 00:08:12,060
[UKAI]
They're not too bad.

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:16,130
[KEISHIN]
All right... let's go!

133
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:18,600
(RYUNOSUKE battle cry)

134
00:08:19,167 --> 00:08:20,268
(whistle)

135
00:08:27,876 --> 00:08:30,278
[DAICHI, internal]
Wait. He switched over
to a feint...!

136
00:08:31,012 --> 00:08:32,514
(TAZAWA shock)

137
00:08:32,614 --> 00:08:35,283
[HITOKA] So fast! He
waited for it!
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice, Daichi!

138
00:08:35,383 --> 00:08:39,621
[DAICHI, internal]
The motions of the spikers...
I feel like I can see them
better than before.

139
00:08:39,721 --> 00:08:40,822
[YU]
Asahi!

140
00:08:42,223 --> 00:08:44,559
[KEI, internal]
If their receives were
even the slightest bit off,

141
00:08:44,659 --> 00:08:47,662
Ohgi never used fast‐attacks.
Not even in the first round.

142
00:08:47,762 --> 00:08:48,797
[KEI, internal]
This'll go left.

143
00:08:48,897 --> 00:08:49,998
[NATSUSE]
Tazawa!

144
00:08:53,702 --> 00:08:55,904
(whistle) (KURASUNO celebrates)

145
00:08:56,004 --> 00:08:58,072
[TAKEDA] So how do I put this...
[DAICHI] It's all you,
Tsukishima!

146
00:08:58,172 --> 00:09:01,275
Everyone seems to have less
hesitation in their movements
compared to before.

147
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:06,147
[KEISHIN]
Yeah well it's not like we only
practiced nothing but new moves
during training camp.

148
00:09:06,247 --> 00:09:11,452
[RYUNOSUKE] Coming your way!
[KEISHIN]
We crammed in consecutive
matches with powerhouses of a

149
00:09:11,553 --> 00:09:16,825
[KEISHIN]
Serve strength, spike strength,
attack diversity, defense, all
sorts of stuff...

150
00:09:16,925 --> 00:09:20,261
[KEISHIN]
compared to before, we saw
a much higher level in all of
it.

151
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:22,496
[KEISHIN]
And we've gotten used to it.

152
00:09:22,597 --> 00:09:23,497
(KURASUNO celebrates)

153
00:09:23,598 --> 00:09:24,666
[TOWADA]
Dammit!

154
00:09:24,766 --> 00:09:26,067
(whistle)

155
00:09:30,438 --> 00:09:32,440
(whistle)
[TOBIO] All right!

156
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:34,008
[HITOKA] Another service ace!
[YU] Nice, Kageyama!

157
00:09:34,108 --> 00:09:38,179
[HITOKA] That makes...
set point!
[TOBIO] Thanks!

158
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:40,214
[TOWADA]
(sigh) You gotta be kidding.

159
00:09:40,314 --> 00:09:43,451
We're up against another
strong team like this in
the first round.

160
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:45,754
(CROWD roaring cheer)

161
00:09:45,854 --> 00:09:49,791
[CHANTING]
Shiratorizawa! (clapping)

162
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:58,232
(whistle)
[CHANTING]
Ushijima! Ushijima! (clapping)

163
00:09:58,332 --> 00:09:59,801
(TOWADA, TAZAWA,
& YOKOTE run down)

164
00:09:59,901 --> 00:10:02,470
[AKIMIYA]
Come on! We still got a lot of
chances left!

165
00:10:02,571 --> 00:10:06,074
[AKIMIYA]
Let's go! Pick it up guys,
what happened to your usual
groove?

166
00:10:06,174 --> 00:10:08,042
[TOWADA]
What!? Grrr...

167
00:10:08,142 --> 00:10:10,278
[AKIMIYA] There ya go!
That's it!
[TOWADA]
I remember the Captain had

168
00:10:10,378 --> 00:10:14,015
[AKIMIYA] That's the spirit,
let's get a point!
[TOWADA]
from trying to yell over

169
00:10:17,251 --> 00:10:19,420
[AKIMIYA]
It's up! Towada!

170
00:10:20,755 --> 00:10:23,324
[TOWADA]
Even if I chased it, I wouldn't
reach it.

171
00:10:23,424 --> 00:10:26,528
[TOWADA]
Even if I reached it,
it wouldn't necessarily lead to
a score.

172
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:32,400
[TOWADA]
And even if it leads to a
score, it's still just a
small, meaningless point.

173
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,869
[TOWADA]
All it's doing is
delaying the inevitable.

174
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,404
(AKIMIYA sprint)

175
00:10:36,505 --> 00:10:39,007
(AKIMIYA heavy breathing)

176
00:10:42,611 --> 00:10:46,648
(whistle) (long whistle)

177
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:58,627
[AKIMIYA]
Hey guys come on, don't look so
depressed. It makes you look
even scarier.

178
00:10:58,727 --> 00:11:01,095
I know people think
you're trouble.

179
00:11:01,195 --> 00:11:06,535
But, if you guys weren't around,
there's no way we would have
been able to enter the
tournament. So thank you.

180
00:11:06,635 --> 00:11:12,974
[AKIMIYA]
Remember, you guys have the
physique and an innate sense for
volleyball, so do your best.

181
00:11:13,074 --> 00:11:16,144
(AKIMIYA quietly sobbing)

182
00:11:16,244 --> 00:11:17,712
(TOWADA surprised)

183
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:29,624
(TOWADA frustrated)

184
00:11:36,831 --> 00:11:37,431
(whistle)

185
00:11:37,532 --> 00:11:39,400
(KURASUNO celebrates)

186
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,835
[HITOKA]
He did it!

187
00:11:40,935 --> 00:11:43,672
[OGASAWARA]
Oh he's so cool!
He jumped sideways!

188
00:11:44,205 --> 00:11:45,740
Incredible...

189
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,544
[SHOYO]
We're going to beat everyone,
and go to Tokyo.

190
00:11:49,644 --> 00:11:54,482
[TOWADA, internal]
He wasn't bluffing. He really
intends to win this thing.

191
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:59,921
[SHOYO] Yeeeaahh!!
[TOWADA, internal]
With that tiny little body of
his, he's actually planning to

192
00:12:00,021 --> 00:12:01,890
(long whistle)

193
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:04,826
[OHGI GM]
L‐let's just keep at it, guys!

194
00:12:04,926 --> 00:12:06,895
[OHGI GM]
It doesn't matter whether
you win or lose,

195
00:12:06,995 --> 00:12:10,131
the most important this is
that you do the best you can.

196
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:14,636
[AKIMIYA]
Hey you dirty punks, don't get
all quiet on me now!

197
00:12:14,736 --> 00:12:18,873
[TOWADA]
(gasp) Uh... Captain?!

198
00:12:18,973 --> 00:12:21,009
[AKIMIYA]
Why is it that you
guys can pick fights,

199
00:12:21,109 --> 00:12:23,244
but chicken out when
it comes to volleyball?

200
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:24,946
(MORITAKE & TAZAWA annoyed)
[TOWADA] We're not chickening
out!

201
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:27,448
[AKIMIYA]
(scared) Aww. Glare at me all
you want,

202
00:12:27,549 --> 00:12:31,720
but I'm up on the second
floor so I'm not afraid of you!
(laughs)

203
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:34,255
[MORITAKE]
What the hell did he come here
anyway?

204
00:12:34,355 --> 00:12:38,893
When your opponent gets going,
you just give up. That's what
I'm calling chickening out.

205
00:12:38,993 --> 00:12:45,767
[AKIMIYA] This is your match, so
what you do is up to you. But,
I'll say one thing!
[TOWADA] Huh?

206
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:51,540
[AKIMIYA]
Being serious... being
desperate... and doing one's
best... Those are all okay.

207
00:12:51,640 --> 00:12:52,707
(TOWADA shocked)

208
00:12:52,807 --> 00:12:54,609
(SHOYO surprised)

209
00:12:55,343 --> 00:12:58,780
(TOWADA starts cracking up)

210
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,281
[MORITAKE]
Dude? What's your deal?

211
00:13:00,381 --> 00:13:02,617
[NATSUSE]
So uh are you like
losing it or something?

212
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:04,653
[TOWADA] Coach.
[OHGI GM] Yeah?

213
00:13:04,753 --> 00:13:06,921
[TOWADA]
We are here on this court.

214
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:09,190
And we're here to
challenge these guys...

215
00:13:09,290 --> 00:13:12,527
[TOWADA] We have no other
objective than to win and
move on.
(OHGI GM surprised)

216
00:13:12,627 --> 00:13:17,365
[TOWADA]
Being content to settle for
our weaknesses and worrying
about how we look...

217
00:13:17,465 --> 00:13:21,335
[TOWADA] It does nothing. It
just makes us look weak.
[MORITAKE] Uh, Towada...

218
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:24,673
[TOWADA] All right,
I'm gonna say it.
[MORITAKE] Say what?

219
00:13:24,773 --> 00:13:26,941
(TOWADA inhales)

220
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:30,344
[TOWADA]
We are going to defeat Karasuno!
Qualify through the first round!

221
00:13:30,444 --> 00:13:32,981
And defeat Shiratorizawa!

222
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:34,716
Alright!

223
00:13:34,816 --> 00:13:37,418
[OYASU]
(laugh) You serious?
You actually said that!

224
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,287
[TAZAWA]
Heck yeah! Bring it on!

225
00:13:39,387 --> 00:13:41,690
[KARAMATSU]
We're gonna defeat
Shiratorizawa, huh? Okay...

226
00:13:41,790 --> 00:13:43,825
[YOKOTE]
Let's give it a go!

227
00:13:43,925 --> 00:13:46,394
[TOWADA]
We are seriously going to win
this one, okay you guys!

228
00:13:46,494 --> 00:13:48,563
[OHGI MINAMI]
Yeah!

229
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:51,365
[RYUNOSUKE]
We're going to end you!

230
00:13:51,465 --> 00:13:53,434
(TOWADA, TAZAWA, & OYASU
annoyed)

231
00:13:53,535 --> 00:13:54,903
(TOWADA grin)

232
00:14:08,883 --> 00:14:11,986
(game in progress)

233
00:14:12,654 --> 00:14:14,723
(KURASUNO celebrate)

234
00:14:14,823 --> 00:14:16,791
[HITOKA] Wooohooo!!
[KOSHI] Nice, Hinata!

235
00:14:16,891 --> 00:14:19,961
[OGASAWARA] You can't stop that!
[OHNO] That first‐year combo
is really something else.

236
00:14:20,061 --> 00:14:25,466
[UKAI]
Yes. But I've noticed... the
second and third‐years have been
better than expected.

237
00:14:25,567 --> 00:14:29,137
[UKAI]
At the moment, Karasuno is
showing signs of a return to
greatness.

238
00:14:29,237 --> 00:14:31,005
[UKAI]
They have a passionate
counselor,

239
00:14:31,105 --> 00:14:33,407
and their new players
are interested in leaving
their mark.

240
00:14:33,508 --> 00:14:38,346
And well, the team is finally
able to do so because they
possess a rock solid foundation.

241
00:14:38,446 --> 00:14:40,048
[OHNO]
What?

242
00:14:40,148 --> 00:14:42,651
[UKAI]
Last year, just
for a short while,

243
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,854
I oversaw practices at Karasuno.

244
00:14:45,954 --> 00:14:49,991
[UKAI]
Back then, they had the skill,
and they had the strength.

245
00:14:50,091 --> 00:14:53,528
[UKAI]
But for some reason, I felt they
had a lack of confidence.

246
00:14:53,628 --> 00:14:57,732
[UKAI]
It was as if they had
subconsciously become
accustomed to losing.

247
00:14:57,832 --> 00:15:00,535
[OHNO]
Well they don't look
like that anymore?

248
00:15:00,635 --> 00:15:04,739
[UKAI]
When the current third‐years
first came to play for the
Karasuno team...

249
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,878
[UKAI]
Karasuno was no longer
considered a powerhouse.
Their reputation was gone.

250
00:15:09,978 --> 00:15:15,016
[UKAI]
The gap between what they had
once admired and what they saw
in reality was very apparent.

251
00:15:15,116 --> 00:15:18,352
[UKAI]
Those players have been there
since the school was nothing.

252
00:15:18,452 --> 00:15:22,957
[UKAI]
But, that may have made
all the difference.

253
00:15:23,057 --> 00:15:25,760
Since they have been able
to come this far without
losing hope,

254
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:29,463
they have developed a resilience
that won't easily waver.

255
00:15:29,564 --> 00:15:31,265
[YU]
Nice one, Daichi!

256
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:34,736
(whistle)

257
00:15:34,836 --> 00:15:36,705
[HITOKA] Amazing! Amazing!
(KURASUNO celebrates)

258
00:15:36,805 --> 00:15:39,040
[STUDENT A]
Man, they got a 10‐point lead.

259
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:41,342
[DAICHI] Let's keep
going! Don't stop!
[KURASUNO] Yessir!

260
00:15:41,442 --> 00:15:44,078
[OHGI GM] Don't worry,
it's gonna be all right!
Just do your best!

261
00:15:44,178 --> 00:15:47,716
(whistle)
[KOSHI] Kageyama, one more!

262
00:15:52,887 --> 00:15:54,188
[KOSHI & CHIKARA] Alright! Yeah!
(KURASUNO celebrates)

263
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,658
[CHIKARA]
Kageyama's serves are spot on!

264
00:15:56,758 --> 00:15:59,227
[KOSHI]
Right. Now it's match point!

265
00:15:59,327 --> 00:16:04,065
[TOWADA, internal]
(out of breath) Every time,
after we're cornered in a
do‐or‐die situation,

266
00:16:04,165 --> 00:16:06,635
we regret the lack
of practice...

267
00:16:06,735 --> 00:16:10,171
[DAICHI]
Kageyama, one more!
Take it to 'em!

268
00:16:10,271 --> 00:16:12,473
[STUDENT A]
The Karasuno and Ohgi
match is about to end.

269
00:16:12,574 --> 00:16:15,844
This is probably a good chance
for us to find some pretty good
seats for the next one.

270
00:16:15,944 --> 00:16:19,981
[STUDENT B]
Yeah. When there's a clear
difference in skill, the
games really are fast.

271
00:16:20,081 --> 00:16:22,416
[AKIMIYA]
(concerned) It's not
over yet! Don't give up!

272
00:16:22,517 --> 00:16:24,185
(whistle)

273
00:16:35,196 --> 00:16:38,166
[TOWADA, internal]
Will I be able to reach it?
I seriously doubt it.

274
00:16:38,266 --> 00:16:44,939
[TOWADA, internal]
Well, we're still second‐years,
so we'll still have another
chance next year... No big deal.

275
00:16:49,410 --> 00:16:53,815
[TOWADA, internal]
That's exactly why we
stay weak! (panting)

276
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,618
(CROWD concerned gasps)

277
00:16:56,718 --> 00:16:59,420
[TOWADA]
Last hit, send it ovaaaah!

278
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:00,589
(OHGI MINAMI shocked)

279
00:17:00,689 --> 00:17:03,291
(YOKOTE battle charge)

280
00:17:05,927 --> 00:17:07,461
[SHOYO]
Tanaka, your way!

281
00:17:09,497 --> 00:17:10,732
[YOKOTE]
It's not over yet!

282
00:17:10,832 --> 00:17:13,401
I'm open over here,
gimme the last hit!

283
00:17:14,603 --> 00:17:15,804
(AKIMIYA hard swallow)

284
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:24,679
[TOWADA, internal]
(awed) At first, I looked
down on this kid...

285
00:17:24,779 --> 00:17:32,020
[TOWADA]
I thought he was an idiot to
say he was going to Nationals.
I guess...

286
00:17:32,954 --> 00:17:34,889
[TOWADA, internal]
...I was the idiot.

287
00:17:40,729 --> 00:17:42,797
(whistle) (long whistle)

288
00:17:42,897 --> 00:17:45,066
(KURASUNO cheering)

289
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:48,036
(CROWD clapping/cheering)
[HITOKA] Oh wow!
We did it! We won!
[OHNO] All right!

290
00:17:48,136 --> 00:17:49,303
(AYA impressed)
[OGASAWARA] I don't believe it!

291
00:17:49,403 --> 00:17:50,438
[KEISHIN]
All right!

292
00:17:50,539 --> 00:17:52,306
[TAKEDA]
We got past the
first match Coach!

293
00:17:52,406 --> 00:17:54,242
(long whistle)

294
00:17:54,342 --> 00:17:56,978
[EVERYONE]
Thank you for the game!

295
00:18:11,092 --> 00:18:14,328
[AKIMIYA]
Nice game! You held
that for a while there.

296
00:18:17,065 --> 00:18:18,366
[TOWADA]
Hey.

297
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,636
[AKIMIYA]
It's natural to feel regret
right now.

298
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,337
(OHGI MINAMI surprised)

299
00:18:23,437 --> 00:18:27,542
No matter how you played...
of course losing feels bad.

300
00:18:27,642 --> 00:18:31,412
It's just part of it.
And it is the same for
everybody who plays.

301
00:18:31,513 --> 00:18:33,915
Even for those who
don't even practice.

302
00:18:34,015 --> 00:18:40,522
[AKIMIYA]
The feeling of "regret" is
natural. And it's a real
thing for anyone. But....

303
00:18:40,622 --> 00:18:45,694
Those who do forget.
Those who lose their regret
are going to stay weak!

304
00:18:45,794 --> 00:18:50,464
[AKIMIYA]
Three years of high school will
be gone in an instant if you're
not paying attention!

305
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:54,903
[AKIMIYA]
So hold on to that regret And
never forget it.

306
00:18:57,105 --> 00:19:02,544
[AKIMIYA]
(surprised) Okay. I'll see ya
later guys. I'll come watch you
again next year.

307
00:19:08,149 --> 00:19:08,983
[TOWADA]
Captain!

308
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:10,384
[AKIMIYA]
Oh?

309
00:19:12,453 --> 00:19:15,657
[TOWADA]
Thank you. Thank you for all
you've done for us.

310
00:19:15,757 --> 00:19:17,926
[OHGI MINAMI]
Thanks!

311
00:19:21,630 --> 00:19:23,164
(AKIMIYA chuckles)

312
00:19:27,536 --> 00:19:29,771
(game in progress)

313
00:19:29,871 --> 00:19:31,606
(SHOYO & HITOKA nervous)

314
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:33,508
(RYUNOSUKE aggressively
eating a banana)
[KOMAKI] No.4, No.4!

315
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:34,943
[MINAMIDA]
Nice receive!

316
00:19:35,043 --> 00:19:38,479
That dude, he gets my depth
perception screwed...

317
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,650
I tried standing next to
him in the hallway earlier.
I felt so tiny.

318
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:45,720
Well hell yeah he's huge!
He's like almost 6'7"!

319
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:51,092
(HITOKA & SHOYO panic)

320
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,461
[RYUNOSUKE, mouthful]
That's playing dirty!

321
00:19:53,562 --> 00:19:56,998
[ASAHI]
It's a weapon... the
height is a weapon...

322
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,534
[KIYOKO, internal]
Tanaka, that banana suits you.

323
00:20:03,137 --> 00:20:05,306
(whistle) (long whistle)

324
00:20:05,406 --> 00:20:07,075
[EVERYONE]
Thank you very much!

325
00:20:07,175 --> 00:20:09,110
[TOBIO, mouthful]
Looks like our next
opponent is set.

326
00:20:09,210 --> 00:20:10,645
(SHOYO nervous)

327
00:20:14,282 --> 00:20:18,286
[DAICHI]
If we win the next match,
we get past the first round
of the preliminaries

328
00:20:18,386 --> 00:20:20,889
[DAICHI]
and advance to the deciding
tournament in October.

329
00:20:20,989 --> 00:20:24,726
[DAICHI] Let's take
care of business guys!
[KURASUNO] Yessir!

330
00:20:24,826 --> 00:20:27,128
[HITOKA, internal]
You lose just once
and you're out.

331
00:20:27,228 --> 00:20:32,767
[HITOKA, internal]
And now... they're facing
someone over six and
a half feet tall...!

332
00:20:32,867 --> 00:20:41,576
(SHOYO panicking)
[SHOYO] (jittery) Man...
6'7"... is freakin' huge...

333
00:20:41,676 --> 00:20:44,312
[TADASHI]
So 6 foot 7" versus
5 foot 3", huh...

334
00:20:44,412 --> 00:20:46,815
[SHOYO]
(annoyed) Hey I'm almost
5‐foot‐four, thank you very
much.

335
00:20:46,915 --> 00:20:51,085
[KEI] That would be 6'7" versus
5'3"... a 16‐inch difference.
[SHOYO] Leave me alone!

336
00:20:51,185 --> 00:20:57,091
[HITOKA]
Sixteen inches, well that's like
the same size as Hello Katey! So
that's not all that much!

337
00:20:57,191 --> 00:20:58,693
[KEI]
Are you trying to
make him feel better?

338
00:20:58,793 --> 00:21:01,530
[TADASHI]
Tekachu is 16 inches
tall too, I think.

339
00:21:01,630 --> 00:21:05,166
[KEI] And the
black‐belly lantern.
[HITOKA] A black‐belly lantern?

340
00:21:05,266 --> 00:21:06,434
[TADASHI]
What's that?

341
00:21:06,535 --> 00:21:08,269
[KEI] It's a kind of shark.
[HITOKA] Oh.

342
00:21:08,369 --> 00:21:11,039
[TADASHI]
Tsukki, you sure are smart!

343
00:21:11,139 --> 00:21:15,243
[SHOYO] Wait... If I could stand
on a black‐belly lantern...
[TOBIO] Huh?

344
00:21:15,343 --> 00:21:18,913
[SHOYO]
Then I could be up to
6 foot 7 inches tall, too.

345
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,849
[TOBIO]
Hey... are you wiggin'?

346
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,818
You're not...
gonna wuss out on us.

347
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,253
[SHOYO] Huh?
(whistle) (long whistle)

348
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,155
[DAICHI] Let's go!
[TOBIO] Hmm?
[SHOYO] Oh?

349
00:21:27,255 --> 00:21:28,990
(KURASUNO hyping up)

350
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,093
[HITOKA]
Hinata has been talking about
a lot of crazy nonsense...

351
00:21:32,193 --> 00:21:34,062
Do you think he's gonna
be alright, Kiyoko?

352
00:21:34,162 --> 00:21:38,232
[KIYOKO]
Uh. Yeah... that doesn't seem to
be anything out of the ordinary.

353
00:21:38,332 --> 00:21:40,134
[HITOKA]
Um okay I hope so.

354
00:21:40,234 --> 00:21:46,040
[OHNO]
Well, kay, this is it!
Now they have to play this
enormous kid...

355
00:21:46,140 --> 00:21:51,045
[OHNO]
No, no! The way they're playing
now, that won't matter! Isn't
that right, Coach Ukai?

356
00:21:51,145 --> 00:21:53,982
[UKAI] Well... who really knows?
[OHNO] Wha‐

357
00:21:54,082 --> 00:21:59,420
[UKAI]
High school boys aren't fully
grown, and how they play is
still a bit raw.

358
00:21:59,521 --> 00:22:02,524
[UKAI]
So having a great ace, or
someone unconventionally tall,

359
00:22:02,624 --> 00:22:04,859
can be the difference between
victory and defeat.

360
00:22:04,959 --> 00:22:08,429
[KEISHIN] Ginger, get your
little red ass over here!
[OHNO] What, you don't mean
that...!

361
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:11,933
Pure height all by itself...
can be a huge advantage.

362
00:22:12,033 --> 00:22:16,771
[UKAI]
How will Karasuno choose to
fight against it? That's the
real question.

363
00:22:16,871 --> 00:22:17,806
[DAICHI]
Let's do it!

364
00:22:17,906 --> 00:22:19,273
[KURASUNO]
Yeah!

365
00:22:21,976 --> 00:22:24,278
[UKAI]
This will be something to see.

366
00:23:55,403 --> 00:23:58,472
[TADASHI]
So a black‐belly lantern is
a type of shark and not a whale!

367
00:23:58,573 --> 00:24:02,544
[KEI]
Lots of fish have misleading
names. The red bream isn't
technically a bream at all.

368
00:24:02,644 --> 00:24:04,078
[TADASHI]
Tsukki, you really know
a lot about fish.

369
00:24:04,178 --> 00:24:05,880
[KEI] Shut up.
[TADASHI] I'm sorry, Tsukki!

370
00:24:05,980 --> 00:24:09,450
[TADASHI]
