1
00:00:01,668 --> 00:00:05,338
[Seijoh Cheer Leader]:
Oh, oh, oh, Seijoh!

2
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:07,173
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Seijoh!

3
00:00:07,273 --> 00:00:10,877
[Date Tech Crowd]:
Go, go, Date Tech,
Date Tech, here we go!

4
00:00:10,977 --> 00:00:13,246
[Toru]:
Let's have a good game!

5
00:00:13,346 --> 00:00:14,881
Yeah, sure...

6
00:00:14,981 --> 00:00:17,216
But try not to strain
yourselves too much.

7
00:00:17,316 --> 00:00:20,219
Remember you guys still
have next year, okay?

8
00:00:20,319 --> 00:00:23,422
I don't think so Oikawa.
Next year means nothing to me.

9
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:26,392
All that matters is
what happens right now.

10
00:00:26,492 --> 00:00:29,729
Whatever makes
you feel better.

11
00:00:29,829 --> 00:00:32,966
[Toru]:
It doesn't matter if you're
a third‐year or a first‐year.

12
00:00:33,066 --> 00:00:34,668
Whoever's stronger is stronger.

13
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:39,172
And whoever lets the ball hit
the floor... is the loser.

14
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:46,479
[Toru]:
It's as simple as that.

15
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,515
Let it go!

16
00:02:30,617 --> 00:02:32,085
Don't worry!
Shake it off!

17
00:02:32,185 --> 00:02:34,788
Ah... Sorry
about that!

18
00:02:34,888 --> 00:02:36,990
I haven't had that
many opportunities,

19
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,426
that was the third missed spike
I've made this set...

20
00:02:40,527 --> 00:02:42,428
[Saeko]:
Man, what's going on with him?

21
00:02:42,529 --> 00:02:44,197
It might have something
to do with him being

22
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:46,465
on the right side,
he's not used to that.

23
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,603
Get this one!
[Shimada]:
And then of course
there's the pressure.

24
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:51,370
It's not easy to handle.

25
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:57,611
[Naruko]:
One‐touch! Yours!

26
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:58,645
[Akiu]:
Got it!

27
00:03:03,049 --> 00:03:06,119
Dammit! These guys are
better than I though.

28
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:10,289
All right!

29
00:03:10,389 --> 00:03:13,359
WakuNan's Nakashima seems
to have found his groove.

30
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:14,994
[Spectator 2]:
And at the same time,

31
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:18,297
Karasuno just can't seem
to get it together.

32
00:03:18,397 --> 00:03:19,833
[Hisashi]:
Hey!

33
00:03:19,933 --> 00:03:21,167
Quit moping around
looking like

34
00:03:21,267 --> 00:03:22,536
it's the end of
the world or something.

35
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,170
It's too early to give
up now, knucklehead!

36
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:26,640
Planet Earth
Defense Force!

37
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,508
Shut up! I'm doing fine!

38
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:33,747
[Yu]:
Yeah! That's what I'm
talking about. Welcome back!

39
00:03:33,847 --> 00:03:36,616
[Chikara]:
Take it easy, don't
make matters worse.

40
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,118
You're just going to drag
everyone else down.

41
00:03:39,218 --> 00:03:41,755
I have to do it!
Just like Daichi...!

42
00:03:41,855 --> 00:03:42,856
Right!

43
00:03:42,956 --> 00:03:44,691
Cooooach!

44
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,325
Huh?

45
00:03:46,425 --> 00:03:48,862
[Shoyo]:
The Tiny Giant...
Was he like that guy!

46
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:50,930
Like WakuNan's Number 1?

47
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:52,231
Yeah, well, kinda...

48
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:53,700
I'd say that in
this prefecture,

49
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,702
his playing style's
probably the closest.

50
00:03:55,802 --> 00:03:58,071
Ohhh!

51
00:03:58,171 --> 00:04:00,273
Hey. Don't you try
to compete against him.

52
00:04:00,373 --> 00:04:02,576
When he's in the air, his
technique's 1,000 times

53
00:04:02,676 --> 00:04:04,811
better than yours.
Just play your own game!

54
00:04:04,911 --> 00:04:07,313
Why is it that every
single time you talk to me

55
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,915
it feels like you're
crushing my soul?!

56
00:04:09,015 --> 00:04:11,084
It was just some
friendly advice, dumbass!

57
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:13,152
What was
"friendly"?!

58
00:04:13,252 --> 00:04:15,121
Uh... Please, guys...
take it easy...
Well, yeah, it's obvious
the other guy is good!

59
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,290
But I want someone to tell me
what I can do about it!

60
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:18,992
[Tobio]:
Please stop trying
to use your brain,

61
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:20,694
you know it never
works out well.

62
00:04:20,794 --> 00:04:21,995
[Shoyo]:
What'd you say?!

63
00:04:23,797 --> 00:04:26,099
[Hanayama]:
Takeru!

64
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,401
Man, did you see that
freakin' line shot?!

65
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:29,503
He's good!

66
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:32,005
Nice kill!

67
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,308
[Nakashima]:
This guy is shorter than 5'7"...

68
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:39,579
You may be amazing,
but I'm not losing.

69
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:44,217
I am going to be the next
Tiny Giant! No. Even better.

70
00:04:45,719 --> 00:04:47,420
[Akiu]:
Let'r rip!

71
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:49,789
Aw, crap!

72
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:51,558
[Ryunosuke]:
You!

73
00:04:51,658 --> 00:04:52,726
Last hit, Hinata!

74
00:04:52,826 --> 00:04:54,493
Yeah!

75
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:57,597
[Shoyo]:
I can... glance it off!

76
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:03,803
[Nakashima]:
Alright! Nice homerun!

77
00:05:03,903 --> 00:05:05,338
It's just like
Kageyama said.

78
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,240
Between the two of
them head‐to‐head,

79
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,076
Takeru has much
better technique.

80
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:14,347
[Nakashima]:
Tabi, one more! Get another one!

81
00:05:15,782 --> 00:05:17,083
Got it!

82
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,156
Agh, that was right
in front of him...

83
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:25,792
All right, this is ours!

84
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:27,527
[Aiku]:
Double block!

85
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,329
Agh, not again!

86
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,801
He's fast!

87
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:44,844
Counterattack!

88
00:05:44,944 --> 00:05:48,181
Right now Hinata, you still lack
the skills compared to Takeru

89
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:52,686
or that of the Tiny Giant...
but c'mon, kid...

90
00:05:52,786 --> 00:05:56,389
[Keishin]:
...you can still fight using
everything you've learned!

91
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:01,628
Yeah!

92
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:04,130
Are you
all right?!

93
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,832
I got a little
bit too excited.

94
00:06:05,932 --> 00:06:07,200
Just be careful, guys!

95
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,668
Could you maybe
do that for me?!

96
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:11,838
Please, this little pissant,
I didn't even feel it.

97
00:06:11,938 --> 00:06:14,841
So?! I'll make you feel it next
time! You're gonna be bleeding!

98
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,976
That was great!
Nice kill!

99
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,678
It's our secret weapon.

100
00:06:18,778 --> 00:06:20,880
Even if we're out‐matched,
we know we have the firepower

101
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:22,348
to bounce back.

102
00:06:22,448 --> 00:06:24,951
Kageyama just said
something that made sense.

103
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:26,385
But you already
know that.

104
00:06:26,485 --> 00:06:27,954
I mean you're the one
who told me that

105
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:29,488
in the first
place, right?

106
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:34,594
Yeah, you're right.

107
00:06:34,694 --> 00:06:37,330
Sorry about that, Specs.
You all right?

108
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,365
I think my life flashed
before my eyes!

109
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,334
[Takeda]:
Hinata got the worst of it.

110
00:06:41,434 --> 00:06:43,402
He's been practicing
some flying receives...

111
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:45,204
even the part where
he lands on his face.

112
00:06:45,304 --> 00:06:47,774
All right,
serve up an ace!

113
00:06:47,874 --> 00:06:49,275
That Number 10 is strong...

114
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,811
He has great
reflexes and mobility!

115
00:06:52,546 --> 00:06:54,280
[Nakashima]:
Shiro!

116
00:06:56,716 --> 00:06:58,151
It's a dump!

117
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,320
Nice Ennoshita!

118
00:07:02,789 --> 00:07:05,224
It's out, leave it!

119
00:07:05,324 --> 00:07:08,762
Gahhhhh! Sorry, man,
that set was low!

120
00:07:08,862 --> 00:07:11,965
I saw the signs for that feint,
but I reacted late.

121
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:15,134
If it was Daichi, he would've
made sure to return that ball

122
00:07:15,234 --> 00:07:16,936
straight back
to the setter.

123
00:07:17,637 --> 00:07:19,238
That's my fault.

124
00:07:19,338 --> 00:07:24,711
[Ryunosuke]:
Uhhhh... heh, heh, heh, heh...
What are you apologizing for?

125
00:07:26,045 --> 00:07:28,715
Eh? EHHHH?

126
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,550
Don't waste your
time trying to do

127
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,351
exactly what Daichi does, moron.

128
00:07:32,451 --> 00:07:35,221
No, no, no... That was
a little bit too harsh...

129
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,357
Uhhh... Look just
do what you do!

130
00:07:38,457 --> 00:07:39,659
[Ryunosuke]:
That was a good receive!

131
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:42,028
You can figure out
all the rest next year.

132
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,730
Uh...

133
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:50,570
A year huh? I think
you underestimate me.

134
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:56,109
[Nakashima]:
Cover, cover!

135
00:07:56,209 --> 00:07:57,544
[Kawatabi]:
Takeru!

136
00:08:03,016 --> 00:08:04,283
Damn!

137
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:05,819
They have to do a bit more
against those blocks.

138
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,522
Or they're gonna find themselves
in one heck of a bind.

139
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:13,492
I don't have the luxury
nor the time to worry about

140
00:08:13,593 --> 00:08:15,529
every little thing
that goes wrong...

141
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:18,431
I can't fix everything
right here and now.

142
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:20,734
Well, yeah, it's obvious the
other guy is good!

143
00:08:20,834 --> 00:08:23,703
But I want someone to tell me
what I can do about it!

144
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,908
Um, can I have a minute, guys?

145
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:31,377
The next time that Number 1
tries to bounce one off

146
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,147
the block, I will
pick up the ball.

147
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:37,383
[Chikara]:
Tanaka, Asahi... you two are
both better than I am

148
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,018
at receiving the
more powerful hits.

149
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,855
So I want you two to defend
against the line shots.

150
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:44,323
I'll set up deep in the
middle to pick up any balls

151
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:45,792
that get tipped back.

152
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:48,628
Now, I can't promise...
that it'll work...

153
00:08:48,728 --> 00:08:50,797
[Asahi]:
Yeah. That sounds great.

154
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:53,499
Yeah...!

155
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,669
Uh, thank you so much!
We can do this!

156
00:08:55,769 --> 00:08:58,972
He really thinks I can pick up
the bigger hits than he can?

157
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:02,576
[Yu]:
Got it!

158
00:09:06,212 --> 00:09:07,814
Yeah!

159
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,383
Takeru!

160
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,485
[Naruko]:
Double block!
I'm on it!

161
00:09:17,757 --> 00:09:19,559
Now, I can't promise...
that it'll work...

162
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:21,661
Yeah. That sounds great.

163
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:26,766
[Chikara]:
If I can't pick this one up...

164
00:09:26,866 --> 00:09:29,636
...then I have no right
to be on this court!

165
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:34,808
Ennoshitaaaaa!
Whooooah!

166
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:36,409
Argh, damn...!

167
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:38,077
Get there!

168
00:10:01,768 --> 00:10:04,203
Ennoshitaaa!
Whoooaaa!

169
00:10:04,303 --> 00:10:05,639
Argh, damn...!

170
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,341
[Ryunosuke]:
Hinata, last hit!

171
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,043
[Asahi]:
Triple block!

172
00:10:14,047 --> 00:10:16,683
[Shoyo]:
If I hit it, they'll stop it...

173
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:18,752
Let's switch things up...

174
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,190
What? No way...!

175
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:26,059
[Yu]:
All right...! I got it!

176
00:10:26,159 --> 00:10:29,328
Uh... Y'see that? I think he
just hit the block on purpose.

177
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:31,097
I think that
was intentional.

178
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:32,899
Uh?! Where did
he learn that?

179
00:10:32,999 --> 00:10:35,902
[Kei]:
It must've been back during
the summer training camp...

180
00:10:36,002 --> 00:10:39,138
That said... I'm sure
that one was a fluke.

181
00:10:39,238 --> 00:10:40,807
One more time!

182
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:43,543
With Daichi out...

183
00:10:43,643 --> 00:10:46,045
and a defense slightly more
unstable than usual...

184
00:10:46,145 --> 00:10:49,148
whether it's intentional or not,
Hinata is really out there

185
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,018
[Koshi]:
trying to make the best
of this situation.

186
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:58,525
Oh, yeahhh!

187
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,359
Oh, yeahhh!
Yeaaaahhhh!

188
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:02,996
That was some pretty
badass stuff, Hinata!

189
00:11:03,096 --> 00:11:05,331
Oh! Ohhh! I just got
a feeling like someone

190
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,566
was praising me just now!

191
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,768
Yeah, well,
it wasn't me.

192
00:11:08,868 --> 00:11:11,805
[Tobio]:
Where the hell
did you learn that?!

193
00:11:11,905 --> 00:11:14,741
I knew that there was supposed
to be an amazing short guy

194
00:11:14,841 --> 00:11:17,110
playing middle blocker
on the Karasuno team...

195
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,246
But I figured he was only good
because of their setter...

196
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:22,582
I guess time
will tell.

197
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:25,484
All right. Hinata,
Tanaka, nicely done!

198
00:11:25,585 --> 00:11:26,820
[Yu]:
Ennoshita!

199
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,123
Nice receive, man.

200
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:39,999
Well that's not cool.
He never talks to me that way.

201
00:11:40,099 --> 00:11:42,301
Yeah, well, maybe if you
were better at your receives

202
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:44,370
then you'd get a few
more compliments.

203
00:11:44,470 --> 00:11:47,173
He is in the game.
What?

204
00:11:47,273 --> 00:11:49,876
[Keishin]:
Ennoshita wasn't feeling
like part of the action.

205
00:11:49,976 --> 00:11:52,278
He felt like an outsider and
wasn't sure he could meet

206
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,614
the intensity of the match.

207
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,283
And that's only natural
coming in off the bench.

208
00:11:57,383 --> 00:12:01,154
But, after that play just now,
he knows exactly where

209
00:12:01,254 --> 00:12:02,455
he fits in.

210
00:12:02,556 --> 00:12:04,490
[Takeda]:
"Where he fits in"?

211
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:06,960
[Keishin]:
He thought for himself,
he relayed it to his teammates,

212
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:08,394
and then he executed it.

213
00:12:08,494 --> 00:12:11,598
Results like that give a player
the confidence they need.

214
00:12:11,698 --> 00:12:13,600
He's feeling it now.

215
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:25,679
It's not easy, is it?

216
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:30,283
[Team WakuNan]:
(cheering)

217
00:12:30,383 --> 00:12:32,886
[Nakashima]:
You believe this?
For the past several years,

218
00:12:32,986 --> 00:12:35,088
these guys weren't
anything special.

219
00:12:35,188 --> 00:12:39,392
They were just there.
Middle of the pack.

220
00:12:39,492 --> 00:12:41,427
[TV Announcer]:
Truly a Tiny Giant!

221
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:44,598
[Nakashima]:
It's like when I first started
to worry about my height.

222
00:12:44,698 --> 00:12:46,900
That game taught me that there
was a different path

223
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,367
I could take.

224
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:51,738
Now, Karasuno's Number 10.
Another little powerhouse

225
00:12:51,838 --> 00:12:54,107
wearing the same number
as the Tiny Giant...

226
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,609
[Hanayama]:
Takeru!

227
00:12:55,709 --> 00:12:57,010
[Nakashima]:
Well guess what.
I'm on this court, too.

228
00:12:57,110 --> 00:12:59,779
And our paths
are not the same!

229
00:13:01,414 --> 00:13:02,448
Whoa!

230
00:13:02,549 --> 00:13:05,484
[Koshi]:
We've caught up!

231
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,486
Agh. Sorry that
set was too low.

232
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,188
[Koshi]:
Make it a good one!

233
00:13:10,389 --> 00:13:11,525
Got it!

234
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:16,395
Aw yeah!
Thank God.
Very nice!

235
00:13:16,495 --> 00:13:18,297
I'm not so sure about
you and your brother.

236
00:13:18,397 --> 00:13:20,667
Sometimes it's like you're
actually the younger of the two.

237
00:13:20,767 --> 00:13:22,769
Don't make me
cry on you!

238
00:13:22,869 --> 00:13:24,904
[Ryunosuke]:
Go for it, Asahi!

239
00:13:30,644 --> 00:13:31,778
Sorry guys,
that one's long!

240
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:33,813
[Yu]:
Overpass! Get under it!

241
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:35,915
[Matsushima]:
Takeru!
[Ryunosuke]:
Kageyama, it's yours!

242
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:41,688
[Nakashima]:
It's times like this, when my
height truly becomes an issue.

243
00:13:41,788 --> 00:13:43,256
I hate it.

244
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,224
MINE!

245
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,595
Nice one Tabi!
I'm on it!

246
00:13:48,695 --> 00:13:50,296
[Shiroshi]:
Connect it!

247
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,731
[Nakashima]:
Mark my words, Number 10,
I'm not losing to you!

248
00:13:51,831 --> 00:13:53,600
[Hanayama]:
Takeru!

249
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:56,836
[Nakashima]:
Not me. And not my teammates.

250
00:13:57,904 --> 00:13:59,639
[Team WakuNan]:
(cheering)

251
00:13:59,739 --> 00:14:01,741
(whistle)

252
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:07,681
Hang in there, boys.
Keep up the intensity,

253
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:09,348
they are sure to make mistakes.

254
00:14:09,448 --> 00:14:11,551
And remember they're
without their team captain.

255
00:14:11,651 --> 00:14:14,420
It's only a matter of time
before they begin to break down.

256
00:14:14,521 --> 00:14:15,388
[Team WakuNan]:
Yessir!

257
00:14:15,488 --> 00:14:17,056
One more thing...

258
00:14:17,156 --> 00:14:20,226
Be sure to show them who the
real Tiny Giant on the court is.

259
00:14:20,326 --> 00:14:21,595
So don't let up, okay?

260
00:14:21,695 --> 00:14:24,397
Uh...! Hm...
Yessir!

261
00:14:24,497 --> 00:14:26,365
(whistle)

262
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:29,168
[Ryunosuke]:
Your serve, Hinata!

263
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:30,704
[Shoyo]:
Yeah!

264
00:14:30,804 --> 00:14:32,271
[Kei]:
Coach told me to
tell you something.

265
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:33,573
What?

266
00:14:33,673 --> 00:14:35,174
Since it's the end...
it might be good

267
00:14:35,274 --> 00:14:38,444
to consolidate sets to Asahi.
If you're smart.

268
00:14:38,545 --> 00:14:39,813
Yeah.

269
00:14:42,015 --> 00:14:44,684
[Ryunosuke]:
It's a fast attack! Look out!

270
00:14:44,784 --> 00:14:46,152
[Tobio]:
Nice receive!

271
00:14:46,586 --> 00:14:47,621
Huh?!

272
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:50,990
[Tobio]:
With Hinata in the back row,

273
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,927
they'll be focusing
on Asahi the most.

274
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:57,597
So for now...
we won't be so obvious.

275
00:14:57,697 --> 00:14:59,265
I'll go over here!

276
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:04,938
That went in! Holy crap!

277
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:07,941
A play at the end of the game
and he sets it to Number 6,

278
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:09,709
who's barely even
touched the ball?

279
00:15:09,809 --> 00:15:12,546
This first‐year setter's
really got some cojones.

280
00:15:12,646 --> 00:15:14,047
Son of bitch...

281
00:15:14,147 --> 00:15:16,315
I don't know if I should
be happy about this or not.

282
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,686
[Ryunosuke]:
Crush it, Asahi!

283
00:15:19,786 --> 00:15:21,420
Kill them in the face!

284
00:15:21,521 --> 00:15:23,823
This is it, take
the lead guys!

285
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:27,994
Let it go!

286
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:33,066
Sorry!

287
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,769
Don't worry, get it back!

288
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:39,438
Don't look at the score!
Just stay calm...

289
00:15:39,539 --> 00:15:41,675
And focus on what
you're doing...!

290
00:15:42,909 --> 00:15:43,877
Uh! Not good!

291
00:15:43,977 --> 00:15:45,545
[Yu]:
It's out!

292
00:15:45,645 --> 00:15:46,680
[Koshi]:
Nice call!

293
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:49,448
Man... I'm really
sorry! Crap!

294
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:50,884
Don't worry about that one,

295
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:53,152
let's just get the
next one, alright?

296
00:15:53,252 --> 00:15:55,288
[Kawatabi]:
Hey, Matsushima! If you're
still actin' like a little wuss

297
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:57,691
when you get back up front,
you're buying me ice cream!

298
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:58,658
A big one!

299
00:15:58,758 --> 00:16:00,694
Alright... let's go!

300
00:16:00,794 --> 00:16:03,196
Well Karasuno's made
it to match point.

301
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:04,598
Yeah right?

302
00:16:04,698 --> 00:16:06,065
[Scorekeeper 2]:
And their Number 10
is back in the game.

303
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:08,467
I think WakuNan
is in trouble.

304
00:16:10,336 --> 00:16:11,470
I got this one!

305
00:16:17,376 --> 00:16:20,213
Those pukes went after
the hole Nishi left behind.

306
00:16:20,313 --> 00:16:21,214
They seem so calm...

307
00:16:21,314 --> 00:16:22,949
[Matsushima]:
You got this, Kawatabi!

308
00:16:23,049 --> 00:16:26,019
[Kawatabi]:
If I miss this one...
it's all over.

309
00:16:26,119 --> 00:16:29,488
If you hit it really hard,
you will look SO cool!

310
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,468
Nice one
Nishinoya, it's up!

311
00:16:42,569 --> 00:16:44,003
[Shoyo]:
It's off target.

312
00:16:44,103 --> 00:16:45,939
But I can still make it
quick‐attack if I want to.

313
00:16:46,039 --> 00:16:47,707
Or, should I leave
it up to Tanaka?

314
00:16:47,807 --> 00:16:48,775
No...

315
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:50,409
I can make it!

316
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:54,748
Agh... Too high.

317
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:57,917
They rushed it!

318
00:16:58,017 --> 00:17:00,520
It's only a matter of time
before they begin to break down.

319
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,688
It's a chance ball!

320
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,222
Hinata!

321
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,423
Uhh...?

322
00:17:04,524 --> 00:17:08,094
Stay in control! Tell me
what makes a good jump!

323
00:17:09,563 --> 00:17:11,464
One with a solid approach!

324
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,333
Things have changed.
At this point,

325
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:16,703
we no longer have an
advantage from their captain

326
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:17,771
being out of the game.

327
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,105
Keep your eye on the ball!

328
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,406
Right!

329
00:17:25,545 --> 00:17:27,013
You're too late!

330
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:02,849
(final whistle)

331
00:18:03,717 --> 00:18:06,485
YEAH!

332
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:13,259
[Team Karasuno/Team WakuNan]:
Thank you for the game!

333
00:18:13,359 --> 00:18:15,829
(applause)

334
00:18:16,696 --> 00:18:18,497
What's up?

335
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:21,400
In a straight‐up fight
against their Number 1...

336
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:26,372
I couldn't beat him. He was more
like the Tiny Giant than I am.

337
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,542
Well yeah, you're like
1,000 years behind him

338
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,977
in experience,
you moron!

339
00:18:32,178 --> 00:18:35,048
Would you two monkeys
quit screwing around?

340
00:18:35,148 --> 00:18:38,384
Come on man,
let's just go line up.

341
00:18:38,484 --> 00:18:41,788
[Nakashima]:
Okay, guys!
Thank you for coming!

342
00:18:41,888 --> 00:18:43,523
[Team WakuNan]:
Thank you!

343
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:50,229
[Makoto]:
Good job, Takeru!
You did your best!

344
00:18:51,598 --> 00:18:53,533
We still have
another game to go...

345
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,168
and the next opponent
is even tougher...

346
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:57,136
Hey, look, guys,
it's Daichi!

347
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:09,215
Um... Hey, uh... I'm sorry.

348
00:19:12,485 --> 00:19:13,587
DAICHI!

349
00:19:13,687 --> 00:19:14,988
Good. To have.
You. Back!

350
00:19:15,088 --> 00:19:17,490
Uhh, Daichi,
are you‐? Umm...

351
00:19:17,591 --> 00:19:18,892
It's fine. No, seriously.

352
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:21,194
I managed to get quite
a bit of rest, actually.

353
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:23,530
I'm better than
you might think.

354
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:26,533
And I'll work harder than
any of you next time.

355
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,538
You guys must be exhausted
from playing some full sets.

356
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:33,807
Now come on. You really
need to rest up.

357
00:19:33,907 --> 00:19:37,443
[Shoyo]:
Oh, I think our next opponent is
playing right now, aren't they?

358
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:41,314
[Daichi]:
I was able to start watching
from about the 20‐point mark.

359
00:19:43,149 --> 00:19:46,586
At first, I thought I needed
to get back as soon as possible.

360
00:19:46,686 --> 00:19:49,656
[Daichi]:
But once I actually
saw you guys playing,

361
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:51,725
I knew you would
be alright.

362
00:19:51,825 --> 00:19:54,794
I actually felt like I'd
probably just ruin the rhythm

363
00:19:54,894 --> 00:19:56,763
you guys had gotten into.

364
00:19:56,863 --> 00:19:58,031
And there at the end...

365
00:19:58,131 --> 00:20:00,534
That was nice receive,
Ennoshita!

366
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:03,970
Yeah...

367
00:20:06,906 --> 00:20:09,843
Uh... guys.

368
00:20:09,943 --> 00:20:12,111
You can go ahead
without me.

369
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:15,582
Um... Ennoshita does
realize that we won, right?

370
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,683
He seems kinda down.

371
00:20:16,783 --> 00:20:17,617
Yeah.

372
00:20:21,154 --> 00:20:23,757
I was able to hit some spikes,
but half of them missed.

373
00:20:23,857 --> 00:20:26,359
And I'd say I was only moving
decently for receives

374
00:20:26,459 --> 00:20:28,695
in the last half.
But, for the first time,

375
00:20:28,795 --> 00:20:30,964
I fought my way to the very end.

376
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:32,599
That said I...

377
00:20:32,699 --> 00:20:34,934
I can't help but feel a sense
of relief that it's over

378
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:36,536
and I know why!

379
00:20:36,636 --> 00:20:39,305
By now, I should be ready to
fight, no matter wins their way

380
00:20:39,405 --> 00:20:42,075
up the bracket!
So what's wrong with me?

381
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:44,711
Quit being such an idiot.

382
00:20:44,811 --> 00:20:47,046
Quit being such a damn coward!

383
00:20:48,414 --> 00:20:50,249
[Hitoka]:
You were amazing!

384
00:20:50,349 --> 00:20:52,351
At the end, I was watching
the game with Daichi!

385
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,021
And we're gonna win
the next one, too!

386
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,926
So, uh why is Tadashi
looking so upset?

387
00:21:00,026 --> 00:21:01,494
I don't know.

388
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:05,665
Excuse me, guys. I need
to go to the bathroom.

389
00:21:05,765 --> 00:21:08,702
So go on without me.

390
00:21:08,802 --> 00:21:11,771
He sure takes going to the
bathroom pretty seriously.

391
00:21:11,871 --> 00:21:13,239
Must have to
take a shit.

392
00:21:13,339 --> 00:21:15,341
C'mon, man, you don't have
to say it like that!

393
00:21:15,441 --> 00:21:18,477
I don't think he really
went to the bathroom.

394
00:21:21,748 --> 00:21:25,018
Hey, Takeru, it's time
for our team meeting.

395
00:21:25,118 --> 00:21:26,620
I can still see it.

396
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,555
Huh? See what?

397
00:21:28,655 --> 00:21:31,558
[Nakashima]:
That very last part of the game
was like it was in slow motion.

398
00:21:31,658 --> 00:21:34,928
It was in that moment,
I was looking eye‐to‐eye

399
00:21:35,028 --> 00:21:36,395
with Number 10.

400
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:38,965
And I saw the spot
I was aiming to hit...

401
00:21:39,065 --> 00:21:41,635
And then I saw
that he saw it, too.

402
00:21:41,735 --> 00:21:45,004
It was the first time I've seen
something like that so clearly.

403
00:21:45,104 --> 00:21:47,440
It sent a shiver
up my spine.

404
00:21:49,175 --> 00:21:55,214
Once more... One more time...
I just want to play!

405
00:22:02,522 --> 00:22:05,458
[Date Tech Crowd]:
Go, go, Date Tech!
Date Tech! Here we go!

406
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,695
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Go, go, go, go, go, Seijoh!

407
00:22:08,795 --> 00:22:13,132
[Seijoh/Date Tech Crowd]
(back and forth cheering)

408
00:22:14,433 --> 00:22:16,703
Hey! Don't
eat too much!

409
00:22:17,937 --> 00:22:19,706
Okay guys...

410
00:22:19,806 --> 00:22:22,642
[Daichi]:
Who will we take on next?

411
00:23:55,802 --> 00:23:57,771
[Keishin]:
Lately everyone has
been pretty reliable.

412
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,339
And as your coach, it gives me
some complicated feelings.

413
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:02,542
[Asahi]:
Nishinoya keeps telling me
all my faults.

414
00:24:02,642 --> 00:24:04,177
[Keishin]:
Aw... Sorry.
You want a drink?

415
00:24:04,277 --> 00:24:05,879
[Asahi]:
Oh no, I'm still
underage, Coach.

416
00:24:05,979 --> 00:24:07,413
