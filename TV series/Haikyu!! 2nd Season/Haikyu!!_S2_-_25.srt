1
00:00:04,253 --> 00:00:07,490
Leave this one to MEEEEE!

2
00:00:50,667 --> 00:00:51,434
All....

3
00:00:51,534 --> 00:00:54,704
...RIGHT!

4
00:00:54,804 --> 00:00:58,407
(loud cheering)

5
00:01:04,914 --> 00:01:07,484
They WOOOOON!

6
00:01:07,584 --> 00:01:11,220
Whoa. I don't think I've
ever seen a play like that.

7
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,023
Incredible. I got
goosebumps...

8
00:01:14,123 --> 00:01:16,258
Well done!
Let's line up!

9
00:01:16,358 --> 00:01:17,293
Right!

10
00:01:24,867 --> 00:01:29,405
This puts us even at 1 and 1.
So don't go getting too cocky.

11
00:01:30,573 --> 00:01:32,308
You should talk.

12
00:03:14,043 --> 00:03:15,144
(whistle)

13
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:17,379
Thank you for
the game!

14
00:03:19,348 --> 00:03:21,317
Their hard work paid off.

15
00:03:21,418 --> 00:03:22,552
Yeah!

16
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:34,964
[Daichi]:
That guy... It seemed like
he could predict exactly

17
00:03:35,064 --> 00:03:36,633
where Hinata was aiming.

18
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,268
If the blockers hadn't changed
the ball's trajectory...

19
00:03:39,368 --> 00:03:41,403
he might have been
able to recover it.

20
00:03:41,504 --> 00:03:44,807
Great game, guys! Both squads
have a lot to be proud of!

21
00:03:48,745 --> 00:03:52,715
Gentlemen, no matter what I say,
it will not change the outcome.

22
00:03:52,815 --> 00:03:56,185
[Irihata]:
And the sting of defeat
is not quickly healed.

23
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:58,988
You are sure to regret
some choices you made.

24
00:03:59,088 --> 00:04:03,426
But still, let me say this;
And never forget it.

25
00:04:04,861 --> 00:04:07,196
All of you fought well.

26
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:17,607
[Toru]:
Let's go thank everyone
who came to support us.

27
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:28,250
[Hajime]:
I couldn't do it...
I couldn't land the last shot.

28
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:31,253
How can I call
myself the ace?!

29
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,542
Thank you all
for coming!

30
00:04:52,642 --> 00:04:56,278
(applause)
Thank you all for coming!

31
00:05:04,621 --> 00:05:07,089
Hey, get over
here, guys!

32
00:05:07,189 --> 00:05:10,292
All right!

33
00:05:12,094 --> 00:05:14,263
[Ryunosuke]:
Get off! Geez...

34
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:16,533
Our bad!

35
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:18,400
What's that, you
stupid little freaks!

36
00:05:18,501 --> 00:05:21,671
[Tobio]:
Hinata! You dumbass!
Nothing about this is funny!

37
00:05:21,771 --> 00:05:26,443
We can never forget this moment,
boys. Just look at them.

38
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,478
We'll pay them back for this.

39
00:05:28,578 --> 00:05:29,679
Yeah!

40
00:05:40,222 --> 00:05:44,561
Oh! They said
our bus is here.

41
00:05:49,799 --> 00:05:50,800
Fine...

42
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:12,388
[Hajime]:
Kageyama!

43
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,761
It's not going to be
the same next time.

44
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:21,731
You got that?

45
00:06:21,831 --> 00:06:23,433
Right....

46
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:32,442
[Ryunosuke]:
I still can't get over
how close it was!

47
00:06:32,542 --> 00:06:34,310
[Saeko]:
HEEEEY!

48
00:06:34,410 --> 00:06:37,279
You guys are
total badasses!
So cool!

49
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:38,948
Big Sis!

50
00:06:39,048 --> 00:06:42,151
Ryu! I can't believe you dug
that out! You looked so awesome!

51
00:06:42,251 --> 00:06:46,155
Thanks... but can ya maybe
dial it back a bit for me?

52
00:06:46,255 --> 00:06:49,125
It's embarrassing to have
you as my biggest fan.

53
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:51,628
Don't get all
bashful ya dummy!

54
00:06:52,662 --> 00:06:54,096
[Ryunosuke]:
Seriously,
stop that Saeko!

55
00:06:54,196 --> 00:06:57,133
Those were great
serves, Tadashi!

56
00:06:57,233 --> 00:06:58,435
Thank you very much!

57
00:06:58,535 --> 00:06:59,802
That last shot!

58
00:06:59,902 --> 00:07:01,370
OhmyGod that last spike
was so freakin' awesome!

59
00:07:01,471 --> 00:07:03,205
Thank you!
Thank you.

60
00:07:03,305 --> 00:07:06,175
The last play, when I saw
Seijoh's triple block coming...

61
00:07:06,275 --> 00:07:08,445
I started to remember
how it went last time....

62
00:07:08,545 --> 00:07:11,013
I gotta say, Coach,
it gave me the chills.

63
00:07:11,113 --> 00:07:15,251
[Keishin]:
He was in a predicament like
Asahi versus the Iron Wall.

64
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,087
Kageyama probably thought about
all the possible outcomes,

65
00:07:18,187 --> 00:07:22,258
and felt that Hinata had the
best chance to get it done.

66
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,963
Or maybe... it might have
just been his pure instinct.

67
00:07:27,063 --> 00:07:31,400
I cannot believe you got around
such a high block Hinata!

68
00:07:33,636 --> 00:07:37,339
It's just... the Great King
reacted to the shot.

69
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,108
I was worried
he might dig it up.

70
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:42,779
[Shoyo]:
I mean, Oikawa was really
amazing out there...

71
00:07:46,148 --> 00:07:49,452
When the bus comes,
can you load it up for me?

72
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,088
I'll go and fetch the guys
who haven't made it yet.

73
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:53,389
Yep!

74
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:06,536
I've got words
for you, Oikawa.

75
00:08:06,636 --> 00:08:08,471
In the heat of the moment,
you get lost.

76
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:11,107
The outcome of your
performance reflected that.

77
00:08:11,207 --> 00:08:13,743
There were places where you
could have utilized your skills

78
00:08:13,843 --> 00:08:14,777
a lot more.

79
00:08:14,877 --> 00:08:16,613
[Ushiwaka]:
It's a real shame...

80
00:08:16,713 --> 00:08:20,850
but you have only your
worthless pride to blame.

81
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,085
Guess you think I should
have chosen differently...

82
00:08:23,185 --> 00:08:27,256
and gone to Shiratorizawa
instead of going to Aoba‐Johsai.

83
00:08:27,356 --> 00:08:28,725
I'm sorry, but there
aren't any teams

84
00:08:28,825 --> 00:08:31,293
that are
guaranteed success.

85
00:08:31,393 --> 00:08:34,431
Perhaps, but you
would have to agree...

86
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:36,633
we have a clear advantage...

87
00:08:36,733 --> 00:08:39,502
in strength, skill,
and experience.

88
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,906
Well, well, still have an
amusing amount of confidence,

89
00:08:44,006 --> 00:08:44,974
don't you?

90
00:08:46,909 --> 00:08:49,979
What was it you said
about "worthless pride"?

91
00:08:50,079 --> 00:08:52,014
I can't recall.

92
00:08:52,749 --> 00:08:55,117
Listen up, Ushiwaka...

93
00:08:55,217 --> 00:08:58,120
I've never thought that
my choice was a mistake.

94
00:08:58,220 --> 00:09:01,824
And, my volleyball career
is just getting started.

95
00:09:01,924 --> 00:09:05,094
[Toru]:
This "worthless pride"
you speak of...

96
00:09:05,862 --> 00:09:08,498
Make sure you never forget it.

97
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:12,301
Oh, and one more thing...

98
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:14,937
[Toru]:
If you spend too much time
worrying about me,

99
00:09:15,037 --> 00:09:16,773
then you're going to get
taken from a direction

100
00:09:16,873 --> 00:09:18,307
you weren't
expecting.

101
00:09:18,407 --> 00:09:19,576
What do you mean by that?

102
00:09:19,676 --> 00:09:23,513
My old friend may be
a bit of an oaf...

103
00:09:23,613 --> 00:09:25,482
[Toru]:
but he's still
totally no comparison

104
00:09:25,582 --> 00:09:28,017
to me or my
skill level...

105
00:09:30,119 --> 00:09:32,855
But now that he's
no longer alone,

106
00:09:32,955 --> 00:09:35,758
he's a much stronger player.

107
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:46,503
Even a great white eagle can
be bested by a murder of crows.

108
00:09:46,603 --> 00:09:48,905
[Ryunosuke]:
Hey! What are
you dorks doin'?

109
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,574
Hurry up and load up
all our gear onto the bus!

110
00:09:51,674 --> 00:09:54,176
Uhh guys, what's goin' on?

111
00:09:55,411 --> 00:10:00,382
If the soil is barren,
it'll never bear any fruit.

112
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,184
I'll show him what
we're made of...

113
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:04,854
[Shoyo]:
from our little
concrete parking lot!

114
00:10:06,556 --> 00:10:08,157
Oh, wait up!

115
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:40,222
They're knocked out.
Just like you'd expect.

116
00:10:40,322 --> 00:10:42,892
[Keishin]:
Can't blame 'em.
They had two matches

117
00:10:42,992 --> 00:10:45,127
against formidable opponents.

118
00:10:47,329 --> 00:10:49,632
Gonna have to thank you
properly, y'know.

119
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,435
Wha‐what's this
all of a sudden?

120
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:53,836
The team would
have been lost

121
00:10:53,936 --> 00:10:56,138
without your persistence
and drive.

122
00:10:56,238 --> 00:10:58,841
[Keishin]:
Because of your commitment
to rebuilding our affiliation

123
00:10:58,941 --> 00:11:00,810
with our old rivals,
we were able to have

124
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:02,679
some great practice matches.

125
00:11:02,779 --> 00:11:05,848
And against some real
powerhouse schools at that.

126
00:11:07,016 --> 00:11:09,786
They only get so far
doing drills and laps.

127
00:11:09,886 --> 00:11:11,387
You need a real opponent.

128
00:11:11,488 --> 00:11:13,856
The fact that we renewed
our relationship with Nekoma

129
00:11:13,956 --> 00:11:16,058
is invaluable. I don't
even think these guys

130
00:11:16,158 --> 00:11:20,196
realize it yet...
or you for that matter.

131
00:11:20,296 --> 00:11:23,199
You've accomplished something
truly amazing, Specs.

132
00:11:23,299 --> 00:11:26,636
No way! Negatory!
Nu‐uh! No!

133
00:11:29,472 --> 00:11:31,040
After we win tomorrow,

134
00:11:31,140 --> 00:11:34,010
then you can shower me
in praise all you want.

135
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:35,812
That's a deal.

136
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,723
Now grab your stuff
and head to the gym!

137
00:11:46,823 --> 00:11:48,491
Meeting started 2 minutes ago.

138
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,092
Yessir.

139
00:11:50,192 --> 00:11:52,662
So gross. You were
drooling all over yourself.

140
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:53,896
You are disgusting.

141
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,032
Hey, my drool
isn't disgusting!

142
00:11:56,132 --> 00:11:58,067
[Yui]:
Oh! They're back!

143
00:11:58,167 --> 00:12:01,103
Congrats on making
it to the finals!

144
00:12:01,203 --> 00:12:03,973
Hey, Michimiya!
How did you find out?

145
00:12:04,073 --> 00:12:06,175
There was a schoolwide
broadcast earlier.

146
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,710
That's so amazing!

147
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:10,547
You guys beat Seijoh to go
all the way to the finals!

148
00:12:10,647 --> 00:12:12,882
That's so... that's
just so amazing!

149
00:12:12,982 --> 00:12:15,017
Almost as amazing
as Yui's vocabulary...

150
00:12:15,117 --> 00:12:17,587
[Yui]:
Wait! Your face! That bruise!

151
00:12:17,687 --> 00:12:19,989
Right.... it happened
earlier today.

152
00:12:20,089 --> 00:12:22,859
[Daichi]:
It looks worse
than it is. I'm fine.

153
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:24,961
Um... Good to hear.

154
00:12:25,061 --> 00:12:28,631
[Male Student]:
Alright! Way to bring
it home, Karasuno Crows!

155
00:12:28,731 --> 00:12:30,500
You guys're badass!

156
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,734
Congratulations!

157
00:12:31,834 --> 00:12:34,971
Hinata, Kageyama!
Well done, guys!

158
00:12:35,071 --> 00:12:36,739
Thanks Miss Ono!
Thank you ma'am!

159
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,708
We got your back
all the way to the end!

160
00:12:38,808 --> 00:12:41,210
You guys better win, okay?!

161
00:12:41,310 --> 00:12:43,746
[Female Student]:
Do your best!

162
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:48,284
Oh man... did they all
stay after school for us?

163
00:12:50,352 --> 00:12:54,424
Oh! The news report
should be starting soon!

164
00:13:05,435 --> 00:13:06,736
Hello and Good evening.

165
00:13:06,836 --> 00:13:08,671
[All]:
Good evening!

166
00:13:08,771 --> 00:13:12,108
[Female Anchor]:
Today, at the Sendai City
Gymnasium in Tomizawa,

167
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,611
the quarterfinal and
semifinal matches were held

168
00:13:14,711 --> 00:13:16,378
for the Miyagi Prefecture.

169
00:13:16,479 --> 00:13:19,315
This tournament decides who will
represent each prefecture

170
00:13:19,415 --> 00:13:21,851
in the Spring High School
Volleyball Championship

171
00:13:21,951 --> 00:13:23,953
or the Spring Nations.

172
00:13:24,053 --> 00:13:27,056
In the first match, underdog
Karasuno High School defeated

173
00:13:27,156 --> 00:13:31,060
the powerhouse Aoba‐Johsai
to advance to the finals.

174
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:35,364
This upset shook things up!
As Seijoh was heavily coming in

175
00:13:35,465 --> 00:13:37,033
to the tournament.

176
00:13:37,133 --> 00:13:38,801
[Male Anchor]:
Indeed. It was
a very balanced team

177
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,037
headed by Captain Toru Oikawa.

178
00:13:41,137 --> 00:13:43,773
I must say it's a real shame
that we won't see them

179
00:13:43,873 --> 00:13:45,442
in the finals.

180
00:13:45,542 --> 00:13:47,444
Geez, they could show us a bit
more! We were won, after all!

181
00:13:47,544 --> 00:13:50,813
No kidding!
No fair. Why are they
only showing Seijoh?!

182
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:53,049
Isn't that how
it always is...?

183
00:13:53,149 --> 00:13:55,818
Sorry, guys, we gotta win a few
more to get the headlines.

184
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,455
Now on to the second
semifinal match.

185
00:13:58,555 --> 00:14:01,223
The squad everyone has their
eye on, took care of business

186
00:14:01,323 --> 00:14:03,693
and also advanced
to the finals.

187
00:14:03,793 --> 00:14:06,496
[Female Anchor]:
Of course, that's
Shiratorizawa Academy.
Okay, now here comes

188
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,832
They are undefeated and hold
three consecutive wins

189
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:11,300
so far in this tournament.

190
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:14,370
They were lead by their Ace,
Ushijima Wakatoshi

191
00:14:14,471 --> 00:14:18,875
who was recently chosen to be on
the national 19‐and‐under team.

192
00:14:18,975 --> 00:14:20,810
They cruise to
a pretty safe win,

193
00:14:20,910 --> 00:14:23,145
taking the match
in straight sets.

194
00:14:23,245 --> 00:14:25,682
[Male Anchor]:
Yes. They finally have
a roster where they can aim

195
00:14:25,782 --> 00:14:29,018
for the long‐cherished desire
for a national championship.

196
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:31,588
In fact, it may be safe to
assume that we could see

197
00:14:31,688 --> 00:14:33,590
a sweep this year.

198
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:35,357
[Female Anchor]:
How long will Karasuno stay
competitive against

199
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,193
Shiratorizawa
overwhelming talent?

200
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,328
Definitely something
to watch out for.

201
00:14:39,429 --> 00:14:42,031
The finals will be broadcast
live on this channel

202
00:14:42,131 --> 00:14:44,333
starting tomorrow
morning at 11:00 AM.

203
00:14:44,434 --> 00:14:47,504
This will decide the winner
of the Miyagi Prefecture,

204
00:14:47,604 --> 00:14:49,872
you do NOT want to miss it!

205
00:14:53,075 --> 00:14:57,647
Alright guys. Tomorrow we face
Shiratorizawa Academy.

206
00:14:57,747 --> 00:15:01,117
[Keishin]:
Not to freak you out, but in the
three years since Oikawa joined

207
00:15:01,217 --> 00:15:05,588
Aoba‐Johsai they have never been
able to beat Shiratorizawa.

208
00:15:05,688 --> 00:15:07,457
That's right. Not a single win.

209
00:15:07,557 --> 00:15:11,661
That's why they're called...
"The Absolute Champions."

210
00:15:11,761 --> 00:15:15,131
Their team consists of top‐tier
guys from our prefecture,

211
00:15:15,231 --> 00:15:17,266
and Ushijima is just the start.

212
00:15:17,366 --> 00:15:20,503
They're known as the best around
for a reason.

213
00:15:20,603 --> 00:15:24,373
Shiratorizawa is even stronger
than you might think.

214
00:15:24,474 --> 00:15:28,144
And I'm sure you realize nobody
believes we can win this.

215
00:15:28,244 --> 00:15:31,481
[Keishin]:
Huh? Let it out, Ginger.

216
00:15:31,581 --> 00:15:33,783
None of that matters, Coach!

217
00:15:33,883 --> 00:15:35,384
That's what
I think anyway!

218
00:15:35,485 --> 00:15:37,353
Hey! Don't mouth off
to him like that!

219
00:15:37,454 --> 00:15:40,590
Oh, woah! No! That's
not how I meant it.

220
00:15:40,690 --> 00:15:43,192
It's cool. Floor
is yours, kid

221
00:15:43,292 --> 00:15:44,527
S‐sure!

222
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:47,196
I'm talking about the fact that
no one thinks we can win!

223
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:49,632
That didn't
matter last match!

224
00:15:49,732 --> 00:15:51,634
So what others
expect of us,

225
00:15:51,734 --> 00:15:54,070
doesn't mean
anything in the end!

226
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:58,374
So, once again we will
be the underdogs.

227
00:15:58,475 --> 00:16:00,810
Let's show 'em all
one stunning upset!

228
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:02,344
Yeah!

229
00:16:02,445 --> 00:16:05,414
You guys have been called...
"The Wingless Crows."

230
00:16:05,515 --> 00:16:07,349
You should all be proud
that not a single person

231
00:16:07,450 --> 00:16:09,586
can call you guys
that anymore.

232
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:12,054
[Takeda]:
Now the crows are
flying the high skies

233
00:16:12,154 --> 00:16:14,491
proudly with the wind
beneath their wings.

234
00:16:14,591 --> 00:16:17,427
And I'm sure that
you guys can go anywhere!

235
00:16:17,527 --> 00:16:20,663
Higher than anyone,
and farther than anyone!

236
00:16:20,763 --> 00:16:24,534
All right, everybody,
the time has finally come!

237
00:16:24,634 --> 00:16:25,868
Let's win again tomorrow

238
00:16:25,968 --> 00:16:28,438
and head to the
national championships!

239
00:16:28,538 --> 00:16:30,807
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

240
00:16:30,907 --> 00:16:33,443
[Keishin]:
All right! Hurry up
and get your butts home!

241
00:16:33,543 --> 00:16:35,745
Hit those pillows
hard and rest up!

242
00:16:35,845 --> 00:16:37,146
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

243
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,581
[Keishin]:
All right,
get outta here!

244
00:16:38,681 --> 00:16:39,949
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir...!

245
00:16:42,885 --> 00:16:44,286
[Shoyo]:
Kageyama.

246
00:16:46,355 --> 00:16:49,225
Wait. Will you
set for me?

247
00:16:57,434 --> 00:17:00,870
Huh? Th‐they can't
be... They are!

248
00:17:00,970 --> 00:17:03,473
Oh, hey, Yachi!
Can throw us a few?

249
00:17:03,573 --> 00:17:05,542
But You already played
two matches today.

250
00:17:05,642 --> 00:17:07,577
You should really
go get some rest!

251
00:17:07,677 --> 00:17:09,078
But if I
went home now,

252
00:17:09,178 --> 00:17:11,914
I'd still be super wired!
Pretty Please!

253
00:17:12,014 --> 00:17:12,682
Please help us!

254
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,350
Uh...

255
00:17:18,154 --> 00:17:19,989
I'm ready!

256
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:21,491
Here!

257
00:17:31,501 --> 00:17:32,469
Yes!

258
00:17:32,569 --> 00:17:33,703
Let's do it again!

259
00:17:33,803 --> 00:17:35,004
Sure.

260
00:17:42,979 --> 00:17:47,984
(Shoyo spiking)

261
00:17:48,885 --> 00:17:49,819
Again, Kageyama!

262
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,287
[Tobio]:
Sure.

263
00:17:52,388 --> 00:17:53,790
[Shoyo]:
What's wrong, Yachi?

264
00:17:53,890 --> 00:17:57,259
Ah, I'm sorry!

265
00:17:57,359 --> 00:18:00,430
It's just... I
remembered something...

266
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:01,864
What's that?

267
00:18:01,964 --> 00:18:04,901
The last time I was helping you
guys with practice like this,

268
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:08,137
you two ended up
in that huge fight.

269
00:18:08,237 --> 00:18:09,305
Wait, did she?

270
00:18:09,405 --> 00:18:11,073
What?! You don't remember?!

271
00:18:11,173 --> 00:18:13,510
Hinata you charged in
grabbed onto Kagayama!

272
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:16,345
And then he shoved you on the
ground! I was really worried!

273
00:18:16,446 --> 00:18:19,682
And I was scared to would
kill each other, you know?!

274
00:18:19,782 --> 00:18:21,651
Uh...

275
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,553
Yeah, uh...

276
00:18:23,653 --> 00:18:24,787
We're sorry...

277
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:27,857
Oh, no, no! I didn't
mean it that way.

278
00:18:27,957 --> 00:18:30,927
When I was watching the matches
today, I got to thinking...

279
00:18:31,027 --> 00:18:34,330
[Yachi]:
If I hadn't become the manager,
then I would've missed out

280
00:18:34,431 --> 00:18:38,367
on so much! I had no idea
what I was getting into!

281
00:18:38,468 --> 00:18:41,671
There's so much passion, and
joy, and panic, and everything!

282
00:18:41,771 --> 00:18:47,143
And when you came out on top,
it was just overwhelming!

283
00:18:47,243 --> 00:18:49,345
I got the chance to see
how hard everyone worked

284
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:51,247
to grow and master
their position.

285
00:18:51,347 --> 00:18:54,283
And then see it all
come together.

286
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,053
I never would have gotten to
experience something like that

287
00:18:57,153 --> 00:18:58,821
without you guys!

288
00:18:58,921 --> 00:19:02,224
And so, thank you!

289
00:19:02,324 --> 00:19:03,793
No! We should
thank you!

290
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:05,361
You actually helped
us out ton!

291
00:19:05,462 --> 00:19:07,497
You were at all
of our practices.

292
00:19:07,597 --> 00:19:09,666
I mean, without her there,
we might not have been able

293
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:12,201
to master the new
fast attack, right?

294
00:19:12,301 --> 00:19:15,538
Really? Even me, Villager B,
was of use to you?

295
00:19:15,638 --> 00:19:19,041
Yes! Of course! We had the
best Villager B in the world!

296
00:19:19,141 --> 00:19:21,277
Wait, was uh...
that a compliment?

297
00:19:21,377 --> 00:19:24,013
Of course it was! And if
you're thankful for her help,

298
00:19:24,113 --> 00:19:26,883
you should make
sure she knows!

299
00:19:26,983 --> 00:19:29,452
Right... Thanks.

300
00:19:29,552 --> 00:19:31,488
What?! Is that really
all you have to say?

301
00:19:31,588 --> 00:19:33,289
Even after everything
she's done for us?

302
00:19:33,389 --> 00:19:36,959
Shut up, Hinata, you moron!
I do appreciate her, okay?!

303
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:39,962
Now, now, i‐it's okay...

304
00:19:40,062 --> 00:19:42,231
What's this about?

305
00:19:42,331 --> 00:19:44,534
[Yachi]:
Uh... Kiyoko!

306
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,639
You know, getting proper
rest is very important...

307
00:19:49,739 --> 00:19:52,241
It is essential to preparing
for your next match.

308
00:19:52,341 --> 00:19:57,146
I‐I'm sorry! Come on,
we're done now! Let's clean up!

309
00:19:57,847 --> 00:19:59,115
Hurry, hurry!

310
00:19:59,215 --> 00:20:00,750
Fiiiine...

311
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:03,119
[Tobio]:
It's your fault that
we got into trouble, you know.

312
00:20:03,219 --> 00:20:05,422
[Shoyo]:
Uh, excuse ME, you
wanted to practice, too!

313
00:20:05,522 --> 00:20:09,358
Sorry, they wanted to practice
so I was keeping them company.

314
00:20:11,093 --> 00:20:14,531
No it's fine, you practiced
with them... thank you for that.

315
00:20:15,932 --> 00:20:17,366
Sure!

316
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,436
[Kiyoko]:
Yachi, it's
already dark out,

317
00:20:19,536 --> 00:20:21,471
would you like to walk
to the bus stop together?

318
00:20:21,571 --> 00:20:23,873
[Yachi]:
Yes, please!
[Kiyoko]:
And you two... make sure

319
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:25,174
after you're done
cleaning up.

320
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:27,143
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
Yes ma'am!

321
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:42,391
[Shoyo]:
Y'know what, Kageyama?

322
00:20:42,492 --> 00:20:44,494
I wonder if the Tiny Giant
felt this way...

323
00:20:44,594 --> 00:20:46,963
on the night
before the finals?

324
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:50,399
I am pretty nervous, but...

325
00:20:53,002 --> 00:20:55,438
I'm super excited, too!

326
00:20:59,241 --> 00:21:02,311
Tomorrow... we win.

327
00:21:02,745 --> 00:21:03,946
Yeah!

328
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:30,132
But man, who'd guess that
Karasuno would make it

329
00:22:30,232 --> 00:22:31,534
all the way to the finals?

330
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:33,135
And defeat Seijoh, too?

331
00:22:33,235 --> 00:22:35,538
It's like a revival of
their old veteran team...

332
00:22:35,638 --> 00:22:37,874
Well, speak
of the devil...

333
00:22:52,121 --> 00:22:53,690
Ushiwaka.

334
00:22:55,825 --> 00:22:57,293
H‐hey!

335
00:22:59,996 --> 00:23:05,201
Tobio Kageyama...
and Shoyo Hinata .

336
00:23:05,301 --> 00:23:06,969
We made it
to the finals.

337
00:23:07,069 --> 00:23:11,974
No matter what you think of us,
we are going to defeat you...

338
00:23:12,074 --> 00:23:14,343
and go to
the nationals!

339
00:23:21,618 --> 00:23:23,986
I'm looking forward to it.

340
00:23:24,086 --> 00:23:25,955
See you on the court.

341
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,898
I wanna play him right now!

342
00:23:38,801 --> 00:23:42,004
All right! Next stop,
Spring Nationals!

343
00:23:42,104 --> 00:23:44,607
Yeah!
