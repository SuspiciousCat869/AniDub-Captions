1
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,970
[KIYOKO]
Oh hello there, Yachi...
Are you done changing?

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:09,807
(HITOKA startled)
[KIYOKO] If you wait a second, I
can walk you home... I need to
change too.

3
00:00:09,907 --> 00:00:12,944
[HITOKA]
Oh no, I'm fine! Actually,
I'm glad to walk YOU home

4
00:00:13,044 --> 00:00:14,846
if that would be more
convenient for you!

5
00:00:14,946 --> 00:00:16,080
[KIYOKO]
Oh don't be silly.

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,782
[HITOKA]
(speechless) Huh?

7
00:00:17,882 --> 00:00:20,885
[KEISHIN]
Alright Specs, I give up.
What is with the face?

8
00:00:20,985 --> 00:00:23,488
[TAKEDA]
Oh, it's nothing
that serious, really.

9
00:00:23,588 --> 00:00:27,625
It's just that the bus we
were going to borrow for
the Tokyo trip has been
claimed by another club...

10
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:31,596
So it looks like we'll have to
come up with an alternate here
at the last minute.

11
00:00:31,696 --> 00:00:35,733
This trip keeps getting
more expensive... I'm not
sure what we should do.

12
00:00:35,833 --> 00:00:39,771
[KEISHIN]
Well... I could try asking
for donations from some of
the alumni...

13
00:00:39,871 --> 00:00:42,106
[KEISHIN]
But budgeting issues are just
gonna keep popping up.

14
00:00:42,206 --> 00:00:45,777
[TAKEDA]
(sigh) I know I'm asking
a lot; I'll check with
some other people.

15
00:00:45,877 --> 00:00:49,681
Plus... if worse comes to
worst... I've got some savings.

16
00:00:49,781 --> 00:00:54,318
[KEISHIN]
Nononono, I can't let you do
that! You gotta send your future
kids to college!

17
00:00:54,418 --> 00:00:56,387
[SHOYO] YACHIIIIIIIII!
(HITOKA startled)

18
00:00:56,488 --> 00:00:58,723
[SHOYO]
Are you gonna be our
new team manager?

19
00:00:58,823 --> 00:00:59,891
[HITOKA]
Oh, um...

20
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:01,593
[SHOYO] Are ya?!
(HITOKA nervous)

21
00:01:01,693 --> 00:01:04,061
[RYUNOSUKE & YU]
Hey, first‐year chick!
Listen up!

22
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:07,799
Here's the thing... You
have no choice but to
join the Volleyball Club.

23
00:01:07,899 --> 00:01:12,036
[HITOKA] Huh?
[RYUNOSUKE] Cause now that
you're around, Kiyoko's
talking to us a lot more.

24
00:01:12,136 --> 00:01:14,171
[DAICHI]
That's not how you
recruit her, idiots!

25
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:16,674
[KOSHI]
I'm so sorry, they can't help
how stupid they are.

26
00:01:16,774 --> 00:01:21,312
[HITOKA] O‐Oh no, they're fine!
Actually... I'm really happy...
[SHOYO] Huh?

27
00:01:21,412 --> 00:01:25,182
[HITOKA]
You see, this is the first time
that anybody's wanted me
specifically...

28
00:01:25,282 --> 00:01:29,721
Up until now, I've just sort of
fallen into whatever group I was
a part of...

29
00:01:29,821 --> 00:01:32,890
[HITOKA]
Even in school plays I'm usually
just a face in the crowd.

30
00:01:32,990 --> 00:01:35,893
Like, "Villager B" or
a tree or something.

31
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:37,595
[BOTH]
A tree?

32
00:01:37,695 --> 00:01:40,532
[HITOKA]
And now... even though I'm
nothing but some random girl

33
00:01:40,632 --> 00:01:42,900
and I don't know the first
thing about volleyball

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,939
or managing a team, somehow I
was lucky enough for Kiyoko to
ask me to join the club anyway.

35
00:01:48,039 --> 00:01:50,475
[HITOKA]
But still, I doubt I can be of
any help to you‐ Huh?

36
00:01:50,575 --> 00:01:52,477
[RYUNOSUKE]
I know just how you feel.

37
00:01:52,577 --> 00:01:54,512
[RYUNOSUKE]
If Kiyoko said to me:

38
00:01:54,612 --> 00:01:57,482
[KIYOKO]
"Why don't you come over here so
I can take all of your money."

39
00:01:57,582 --> 00:01:59,751
[RYUNOSUKE]
You bet your sweet ass
I would go with her.

40
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,219
[YU] Yeah, that's what
I'm talkin' about!
[HITOKA] That's...
not what I meant...

41
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:04,221
[SHOYO]
What a cool thing to say!

42
00:02:04,321 --> 00:02:06,357
[ASAHI]
I bet I know what that
conversation's about.

43
00:02:06,458 --> 00:02:09,594
[SHOYO] Huh? That's
right, I forgot!
[HITOKA] Oh?

44
00:02:09,694 --> 00:02:12,597
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh? (gawk)

45
00:02:14,632 --> 00:02:16,734
[YU]
Sweet! We'll see ya in Tokyo,
Nekomaaaa! (excited yelling)

46
00:02:16,834 --> 00:02:19,837
[RYUNOSUKE]
(riled up laughing) You punks
are goin' down!

47
00:02:19,937 --> 00:02:22,406
(SHOYO excited yelling)

48
00:03:56,367 --> 00:04:00,404
[MADOKA]
Honey? Mommy's got another work
meeting to attend this evening,

49
00:04:00,505 --> 00:04:02,607
so expect me to be home
a little late tonight.

50
00:04:02,707 --> 00:04:05,009
[HITOKA]
'Kay... Be careful out there,
Mom.

51
00:04:05,109 --> 00:04:07,979
[MADOKA]
Please have the house cleaned
up before I get back.

52
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:09,346
[HITOKA]
Uh‐huh!

53
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:11,282
[MADOKA]
Oh? What's this?

54
00:04:11,783 --> 00:04:12,850
[HITOKA]
Hmm?

55
00:04:13,685 --> 00:04:15,620
[HITOKA]
Oh! I meant to tell you...

56
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:19,691
I've been invited to be
a manager of the boys'
volleyball team at school.

57
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:20,858
[MADOKA]
Really?

58
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,661
(doorbell ringing)

59
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:26,631
[MADOKA] Just a second,
I'll be right down.
[EMPLOYEE] All right.

60
00:04:26,731 --> 00:04:29,366
[MADOKA]
Karasuno's volleyball team's
been to nationals before,

61
00:04:29,467 --> 00:04:31,903
haven't they?
They must be pretty good.

62
00:04:32,003 --> 00:04:33,471
[HITOKA]
Yeah!

63
00:04:33,571 --> 00:04:35,840
[HITOKA]
They've really been
making a comeback recently!

64
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:37,909
[EMPLOYEE]
The taxi just
pulled up outside.

65
00:04:38,009 --> 00:04:40,144
[MADOKA] What do you
know about volleyball?
(EMPLOYEE & HITOKA surprised)

66
00:04:40,244 --> 00:04:42,580
[HITOKA]
N‐not much, but I'm
gonna study up so‐

67
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,816
[MADOKA]
(sigh) That's all
well and good...

68
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:48,219
but just make sure you
do your best, I know that
everyone on the team will.

69
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:50,922
[MADOKA]
You don't want to be the lazy
one do you?

70
00:04:51,022 --> 00:04:52,990
(HITOKA surprised,
into sad sigh)

71
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:55,392
(EMPLOYEE frustrated sigh)
[MADOKA] You'll have to make
breakfast tomorrow, okay?

72
00:04:55,493 --> 00:04:57,562
[HITOKA]
Uh, yes ma'am.

73
00:04:59,396 --> 00:05:03,100
[EMPLOYEE]
Um hey... Don't you think you
were a little harsh with her?

74
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:04,736
I mean, she IS your daughter.

75
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:07,304
[MADOKA]
What? I wasn't 'harsh' with her!

76
00:05:07,404 --> 00:05:11,976
[EMPLOYEE]
I've seen how pessimistic she
can be, and honestly I think
you're the main reason why.

77
00:05:12,076 --> 00:05:15,513
[MADOKA]
Well, excuse me for wanting my
child to be a strong person!

78
00:05:15,613 --> 00:05:18,750
[MADOKA]
If she loses it over one small
criticism like that...

79
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,386
[MADOKA]
...then I can only imagine what
the real world will do to her.

80
00:05:22,487 --> 00:05:24,489
(HITOKA moping)

81
00:05:27,124 --> 00:05:35,099
(school bell ringing)

82
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:37,569
[KIYOKO] Is something
bothering you?
(HITOKA startled)

83
00:05:37,669 --> 00:05:40,137
[KIYOKO]
For what it's worth...
I used to play sports,

84
00:05:40,237 --> 00:05:44,308
but I never knew anything about
volleyball or what it takes to
be the manager of a whole team.

85
00:05:44,408 --> 00:05:45,443
[HITOKA]
Huh?

86
00:05:45,543 --> 00:05:46,978
[KIYOKO]
But the thing is...

87
00:05:47,078 --> 00:05:48,980
you don't always know you have
a passion for something

88
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,582
before you start doing it.

89
00:05:50,682 --> 00:05:52,484
[KIYOKO]
You don't need to have strong
feelings about it

90
00:05:52,584 --> 00:05:55,419
or be on some kind of
mission from day one.

91
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:02,860
[KIYOKO]
Sometimes, the things you fall
into by chance turn out to be
the most important ones of all.

92
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,100
[KIYOKO]
As long as you go into it with
a tiny bit of wonder... you're
all set.

93
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,402
[KEISHIN] Hinata, Tsukishima!
[SHOYO] Sir!
[KEI] Yeah?

94
00:06:11,503 --> 00:06:13,404
[KEISHIN] Since both of
you are middle blockers,
[KOSHI] The floor's gotten all
wet...

95
00:06:13,505 --> 00:06:14,739
[KEISHIN]
I want you to get to the point

96
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,641
where you can use
your block as a weapon.

97
00:06:16,741 --> 00:06:18,242
[KEISHIN]
When I'm through with you two,

98
00:06:18,342 --> 00:06:20,311
you'll even be able to
block Ushiwaka.

99
00:06:20,411 --> 00:06:23,548
[KEISHIN]
Be sure to keep that in mind
during the practice match today,
you got that?

100
00:06:23,648 --> 00:06:25,783
[SHOYO] Right!
[KEI] Sure.

101
00:06:25,883 --> 00:06:28,152
[KEI]
(internal) Yeah right,
we'll never block that guy.

102
00:06:28,252 --> 00:06:30,187
[KEISHIN]
Okay then... back to work!

103
00:06:30,287 --> 00:06:31,556
[SHOYO]
Okay!

104
00:06:31,656 --> 00:06:34,692
[KEISHIN]
(pensive) Okay
seriously, dude...

105
00:06:34,792 --> 00:06:36,928
Are they gonna pass
these exams or what?

106
00:06:37,028 --> 00:06:38,763
[TAKEDA]
Uhh... Well...

107
00:06:38,863 --> 00:06:41,265
[KEISHIN] I'm worried
about these Stooges.
[TAKEDA] Yeah...

108
00:06:41,365 --> 00:06:44,769
[KIYOKO]
The Ougi West High School team
will be arriving at 4:30!

109
00:06:44,869 --> 00:06:46,170
(ALL acknowledges)

110
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:47,672
[KIYOKO]
Hey, Yachi...
Could you line up

111
00:06:47,772 --> 00:06:49,273
a few folding chairs along
the side of the court?

112
00:06:49,373 --> 00:06:51,609
Maybe... about eight?

113
00:06:51,709 --> 00:06:54,011
[HITOKA]
Uh... okay! I can handle it!

114
00:06:54,111 --> 00:06:55,680
[KIYOKO] Take one at a
time if you need to!
[RYUNOSUKE] Kiyoko's
smiling and I like it.

115
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,049
[YU]
This world of ours is
a beautiful place.

116
00:06:58,149 --> 00:06:59,116
[SHOYO]
Need help?

117
00:06:59,216 --> 00:07:00,384
[HITOKA]
Oh no, I'm fine!

118
00:07:00,485 --> 00:07:01,619
You just go do your thing!

119
00:07:01,719 --> 00:07:04,589
[SHOYO]
Okay! (slap self)

120
00:07:04,689 --> 00:07:06,891
I am not gonna lose this!

121
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:11,729
[HITOKA]
Hinata... Today's game is just a
practice match, isn't it? It's
not real?

122
00:07:11,829 --> 00:07:13,197
[SHOYO]
Yeah.

123
00:07:13,297 --> 00:07:15,132
[HITOKA]
And uh... you're studying hard

124
00:07:15,232 --> 00:07:16,501
so you can take a trip...

125
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:18,636
for ANOTHER game
that's not real...

126
00:07:18,736 --> 00:07:21,606
Why sacrifice so much
just for something like that?

127
00:07:21,706 --> 00:07:25,843
Huh? I want to be strong...
so that I can win.

128
00:07:25,943 --> 00:07:28,179
[HITOKA] Oh... That makes sense.
[SHOYO] Hmm?

129
00:07:28,279 --> 00:07:31,215
[HITOKA]
I'm sure you must have a whole
bunch of reasons, huh?

130
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:34,586
[SHOYO]
Huh? What? Reasons for winning?

131
00:07:34,686 --> 00:07:36,220
[HITOKA]
Uh, I guess so.

132
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:39,591
[SHOYO]
Does anyone really need a reason
for wanting to win?

133
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,358
(HITOKA nervous gulp)
(practicing drills)

134
00:07:41,459 --> 00:07:44,729
[SHOYO]
Kageyama! Do you think you need
a reason for wanting to win?

135
00:07:44,829 --> 00:07:47,098
[TOBIO]
A reason? That's a pretty dumb
question...

136
00:07:47,198 --> 00:07:50,702
I mean, do you think you need
some kinda reason for eating
food when you're hungry?

137
00:07:50,802 --> 00:07:53,771
[SHOYO]
I dunno... let's see...
(forceful pondering)

138
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:56,441
[HITOKA, internal]
Oh... so it's the same
as hunger for them.

139
00:07:56,541 --> 00:08:00,478
[HITOKA] Forget it...
That was rhetorical.
[SHOYO & TOBIO] Rhe... tortical?

140
00:08:00,578 --> 00:08:05,650
[KEI]
She said it's rhetorical! A
question that doesn't require an
answer! We just studied that!

141
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,218
(TOBIO & SHOYO stunned)
(speechless)

142
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,486
[OUGI WEST]
Hey, we made it!

143
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:10,021
[DAICHI]
Huh? Get ready!

144
00:08:10,121 --> 00:08:11,756
[KURASUNO]
Yes sir!

145
00:08:13,157 --> 00:08:15,993
[KIYOKO]
We should probably go line up
with them too.

146
00:08:16,093 --> 00:08:17,495
[HITOKA]
Okay!

147
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:23,901
[HITOKA]
Wow... All of those guys are so
tall! (notice)

148
00:08:25,803 --> 00:08:29,140
[SHOYO]
Do you really need a reason for
wanting to win?

149
00:08:31,075 --> 00:08:33,511
[KIYOKO]
You don't need to have strong
feelings about it

150
00:08:33,611 --> 00:08:36,614
or be on some kind of
mission from day one.

151
00:08:36,714 --> 00:08:38,349
[KOSHI]
Step back a bit, Hinata.

152
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:39,651
[SHOYO]
Oh, okay!

153
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:40,818
[DAICHI]
Alright guys!

154
00:08:40,918 --> 00:08:43,054
[EVERYONE]
Thank you for the game!

155
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:06,778
[OUGI WEST ALUM]
So today's game is with
Karasuno, huh? I know them.

156
00:09:06,878 --> 00:09:09,280
[OUGI WEST ALUM]
That's the team they call the
Wingless Crows.

157
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:13,384
[OUGI WEST GM]
(hearty laugh) From what I
understand, that nickname
doesn't apply to them anymore.

158
00:09:13,485 --> 00:09:17,755
(OUGI WEST ALUM confused)
[OUGI WEST GM] At Inter High
prelims, they went a full set
against Seijoh.

159
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:22,527
[OUGI WEST GM] The game went to
a deuce and the score climbed
into the 30s.
[OUGI WEST ALUM] Really?!

160
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:28,833
[OUGI WEST ALUM]
Well, I guess they do have
Nishinoya from Chidori‐yama and
Kageyama from Kitagawa First.

161
00:09:28,933 --> 00:09:31,302
[OUGI WEST GM]
Yeah well. That's not all
they've got.

162
00:09:31,402 --> 00:09:33,270
[OUGI WEST ALUM]
Hm? So there's more?

163
00:09:33,370 --> 00:09:36,273
[OUGI WEST GM]
Number 10... He's a
little spark plug.

164
00:09:36,373 --> 00:09:40,311
Karasuno's lucky to have such
a strong first‐year on their
center line.

165
00:09:40,411 --> 00:09:43,848
[OUGI WEST GM]
Sometimes I get chills just
watching that kid play.

166
00:09:45,483 --> 00:09:47,585
[OUGI WEST GM] They're moving
up. Keep an eye on those guys.

167
00:09:47,685 --> 00:09:52,457
[TAKEDA]
Oh! Thank you so much for
traveling all this way,
gentlemen.

168
00:09:52,557 --> 00:09:53,458
[YU]
Nice rip!

169
00:09:53,558 --> 00:09:54,926
[OUGI WEST 1]
Nice kill!

170
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,994
[KOSHI]
Nice kill!

171
00:09:57,995 --> 00:10:00,498
[DAICHI]
It's almost time
to start! Suit up!

172
00:10:00,598 --> 00:10:01,899
[KURASUNO]
Sir!

173
00:10:03,267 --> 00:10:04,769
(HITOKA flustered)

174
00:10:05,437 --> 00:10:06,671
[KOSHI]
Hm?

175
00:10:06,771 --> 00:10:09,406
[KOSHI]
(laughter) You put it on
backwards!

176
00:10:09,507 --> 00:10:10,842
(HITOKA trembling)
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice one.

177
00:10:10,942 --> 00:10:12,610
[KIYOKO]
Calm down... They're just boys.

178
00:10:12,710 --> 00:10:14,011
[YU]
Hey Asahi!

179
00:10:14,111 --> 00:10:15,613
What's that weird string
you have in your hair?

180
00:10:15,713 --> 00:10:16,413
A shoelace?!

181
00:10:16,514 --> 00:10:17,782
(ASAHI chuckles)

182
00:10:17,882 --> 00:10:20,184
You mean my headband?
Thank you...

183
00:10:20,284 --> 00:10:22,520
Coming from you, that's
a real confidence boost.

184
00:10:22,620 --> 00:10:25,523
[DAICHI] Don't slouch.
[RYUNOSUKE] you changing
up your look, Asahi?

185
00:10:25,623 --> 00:10:27,625
[ASAHI]
Yeah well sorta...

186
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:30,962
[ASAHI]
Hmm? Hey uh what's up, Kiyoko?

187
00:10:31,062 --> 00:10:34,165
[KIYOKO]
If you keep tying your hair so
tight, you'll go bald one day.

188
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:35,533
(ASAHI shocked)

189
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:36,434
[ASAHI]
So I did this.

190
00:10:36,534 --> 00:10:37,669
(YU laughing)

191
00:10:37,769 --> 00:10:39,170
Guess I better be careful too.

192
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:41,238
[TADASHI]
Y'know a lot of girls
like bald guys.

193
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:43,541
[RYUNOSUKE] I'm not
bald, pipsqueak!
[YU] It's awful.

194
00:10:43,641 --> 00:10:46,911
(SHOYO battle cry)
[KEI] Don't you think you should
maybe put your uniform on,
Tanaka?

195
00:10:47,011 --> 00:10:48,446
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey, you're not the boss of me!

196
00:10:48,546 --> 00:10:50,147
[HITOKA]
They're so scrappy...

197
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:53,350
[KIYOKO]
Well of course... They're
crows... So they pick fights.

198
00:10:53,451 --> 00:10:58,389
[RYUNOSUKE] I already
told you, I'm not bald!
[KIYOKO]
But when it's game time, they

199
00:10:58,490 --> 00:11:01,493
(long whistle)
[DAICHI] Over here!

200
00:11:01,593 --> 00:11:05,497
[KEISHIN]
This is the first time we've
played against another team
since the Inter Highs.

201
00:11:05,597 --> 00:11:10,367
[KEISHIN] Remember how that
felt... It was rough, right?
[KURASUNO] Yes sir!

202
00:11:10,468 --> 00:11:13,605
[KEISHIN]
Heh. So make sure it doesn't
happen again today!

203
00:11:13,705 --> 00:11:14,706
[KURASUNO]
Right!

204
00:11:14,806 --> 00:11:17,274
[DAICHI]
Karasunooo... fight!

205
00:11:17,374 --> 00:11:18,576
[KURASUNO]
Fiiight!

206
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:20,812
[OUGI WEST 1] Let's go!
[OUGI WEST] Yeah!

207
00:11:20,912 --> 00:11:23,080
[TAKEDA]
Has our team played
Ougi West before?

208
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,749
[KIYOKO]
No, this is the first time.

209
00:11:24,849 --> 00:11:25,950
(HITOKA soft gasp)

210
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:31,355
(long whistle)
(HITOKA gasps)

211
00:11:32,557 --> 00:11:35,927
(pre‐serve hype)

212
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,300
(whistle)

213
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,869
(ALL celebrate)

214
00:11:44,969 --> 00:11:46,471
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice, Kageyama!

215
00:11:46,571 --> 00:11:48,405
[TOBIO] Thanks!
[HITOKA] Wait, does
that count as a point?

216
00:11:48,506 --> 00:11:50,442
[DAICHI] Again!
[KIYOKO] Hey Yachi...
that's one for your side.

217
00:11:50,542 --> 00:11:52,209
[HITOKA]
Ah! Right, sorry!

218
00:11:52,309 --> 00:11:54,145
[OUGI WEST 1] Cover, cover!
[YU] Watch Number 8!

219
00:11:54,245 --> 00:11:56,080
[8, internal]
It's just a single block...

220
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:00,084
[DAICHI]
Good save!

221
00:12:00,184 --> 00:12:01,619
[HITOKA]
He's got great reflexes!

222
00:12:01,719 --> 00:12:03,354
[YU] Kageyama!
[TOBIO] Here!

223
00:12:05,623 --> 00:12:06,357
(whistle)

224
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,759
(KURASUNO cheers)

225
00:12:07,859 --> 00:12:10,394
My arm would rip right
off if I tried that...

226
00:12:12,363 --> 00:12:15,266
[YU] Good one, Captain!
[OUGI WEST ALUM, internal]
They've got excellent control...

227
00:12:15,366 --> 00:12:16,333
[RYUNOSUKE]
Left!

228
00:12:17,769 --> 00:12:20,438
[HITOKA]
Oh wow... You can
hear the impact!

229
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:25,342
(soft laugh)
Crazy, right? But... if
you get yourself distracted by
those two power attackers...

230
00:12:25,443 --> 00:12:27,078
[HITOKA]
Oh? (surprised)

231
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:30,147
[KIYOKO]
...you'll lose sight
of our secret weapon.

232
00:12:36,287 --> 00:12:39,423
[SHOYO] I may not be tall.
But I can fly!
(whistle)

233
00:12:39,524 --> 00:12:43,227
[KIYOKO]
If anyone's one step behind...
they'll never catch him.

234
00:12:44,161 --> 00:12:46,731
Okay... Higher!
I can get it higher!

235
00:12:46,831 --> 00:12:48,399
[TOBIO]
You got it!

236
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:51,869
[HITOKA, internal]
He's not even satisfied
with that?

237
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:57,208
(whistle)
(KURASUNO celebrates)

238
00:12:59,544 --> 00:13:01,378
[EVERYONE]
Thanks for the game!

239
00:13:03,648 --> 00:13:08,385
[HITOKA]
That was incredible! How do I
describe it uh... like... uh...

240
00:13:08,486 --> 00:13:11,322
[SHOYO] Like FWAAAAH right?!
[HITOKA] Mmhmm! FWAAAAH!

241
00:13:11,422 --> 00:13:13,925
[SHOYO] Then you should join!
[HITOKA] (shock) W‐Well, I'm not
so sure...

242
00:13:14,025 --> 00:13:17,394
[SHOYO] You know
you want to, Yachi!
[KEI] She can't use words
either... She's gonna fit right

243
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:21,866
[MADOKA]
Just make sure you do your
best. I know that everyone
on the team will.

244
00:13:21,966 --> 00:13:24,201
[MADOKA]
You don't want to be
the lazy one, do you?

245
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:27,705
[HITOKA]
But... you have such a great
team and I'm just Villager B

246
00:13:27,805 --> 00:13:29,607
who doesn't know
anything about sports...

247
00:13:29,707 --> 00:13:31,342
[HITOKA]
I think I'd just
get in your way‐

248
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:33,745
[SHOYO]
I played Villager B one time!
But people didn't like it.

249
00:13:33,845 --> 00:13:37,615
(HITOKA question)
[SHOYO] Yeah, 'cause
I tried to stand out more
than the main character.

250
00:13:37,715 --> 00:13:39,851
[TOBIO]
Oh Villager B, huh? Wow. (smirk)

251
00:13:39,951 --> 00:13:42,119
[SHOYO]
Huh?! Are you makin' fun
of me, butthole?!

252
00:13:42,219 --> 00:13:45,923
[SHOYO]
Villager B is cool...
Cooler than anybody on
the whole planet.

253
00:13:46,023 --> 00:13:48,125
(HITOKA concerned)
[TOBIO] Pff, yeah, okay.
Whatever you say.

254
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:49,961
[SHOYO]
Well, what kind of
roles have YOU played?

255
00:13:50,061 --> 00:13:52,163
[TOBIO]
Uh. Let's see.
The freakin' moon!

256
00:13:52,263 --> 00:13:54,098
[KEI] Wow, so important...
[SHOYO] Oh dude, that's
pretty awesome!

257
00:13:54,198 --> 00:13:56,033
[HITOKA] Villager B is cool...
[TOBIO] Yeah I know.

258
00:13:56,133 --> 00:13:59,571
[HITOKA]
Cooler than anybody
on the whole planet.

259
00:13:59,671 --> 00:14:01,205
(HITOKA determined)

260
00:14:24,596 --> 00:14:26,263
[SHOYO]
You're a lifesaver, Yachi!

261
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:29,434
[SHOYO]
Thank you so much for tutoring
us on a Saturday!

262
00:14:29,534 --> 00:14:30,768
[TOBIO]
Yeah, thanks.

263
00:14:30,868 --> 00:14:32,870
[HITOKA]
Sure thing...
Hope you both pass!

264
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,639
[SHOYO]
Sorry for any trouble ma'am!

265
00:14:34,739 --> 00:14:38,209
[MADOKA]
Not at all... I hope my sweetie
did a good job tutoring you.

266
00:14:38,309 --> 00:14:41,178
[SHOYO]
Yeah! Now I KNOW
we'll pass! Maybe!

267
00:14:41,278 --> 00:14:42,814
[HITOKA, internal]
Maybe?

268
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:44,549
We will not let your
help go to waste!

269
00:14:44,649 --> 00:14:46,117
You're like our muse!

270
00:14:46,217 --> 00:14:47,452
(HITOKA & MADOKA embarrassed)

271
00:14:47,552 --> 00:14:50,287
M'Kay let's see. Muse
is a noun that means...

272
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:53,925
"an entity that inspires
excellence and achievement in
music or art."

273
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:57,529
[HITOKA, internal]
Not exactly fitting, but
I'm glad they've been paying
attention...

274
00:14:57,629 --> 00:14:59,797
[MADOKA]
That's great... Best
of luck to you then.

275
00:14:59,897 --> 00:15:04,301
[SHOYO]
Thank you! Heh, I can't wait
for all of us to go to Tokyo
together!

276
00:15:04,401 --> 00:15:10,174
[HITOKA]
Ah! M‐me too uh! (internal) Oh
great... I hadn't mentioned that
part to my mom yet...

277
00:15:10,274 --> 00:15:11,743
[SHOYO]
See ya next week, Yachi!

278
00:15:11,843 --> 00:15:13,611
[HITOKA]
Uh, see ya!

279
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,150
[MADOKA]
What's this about Tokyo?

280
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,654
[HITOKA]
(startled) Oh... W‐Well I was
gonna tell you...

281
00:15:22,754 --> 00:15:26,057
[EMPLOYEE]
I'm really sorry about being
late. I got hung up. Are you
ready to go?

282
00:15:26,157 --> 00:15:31,395
[MADOKA]
Sorry, dear, I've got to get to
my meeting now... Looks like
I'll be home late again tonight.

283
00:15:31,496 --> 00:15:32,764
[HITOKA]
Mm‐hm

284
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,799
(EMPLOYEE staring)
[MADOKA] Now then, shall we?

285
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:36,934
[EMPLOYEE]
(shocked) Now wait,
hang on a sec!

286
00:15:37,034 --> 00:15:40,438
[EMPLOYEE]
Your daughter's trying to tell
you something over here! What is
it, sweetie?

287
00:15:40,538 --> 00:15:44,175
[HITOKA]
Oh I'm fine, don't worry about
me! You have a good day!

288
00:15:44,275 --> 00:15:46,644
[EMPLOYEE]
Ah... Well, if you're sure...

289
00:15:46,744 --> 00:15:47,779
(HITOKA nod)

290
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:50,081
[EMPLOYEE]
(annoyed) Workaholic...

291
00:15:52,584 --> 00:15:56,488
[SHOYO]
Yachi's notes are perfect!
She should like major in
note‐taking!

292
00:15:56,588 --> 00:15:59,390
And after she joins the club,
we'll have TWO managers!

293
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,693
We'll be like one of
those big fancy schools!

294
00:16:01,793 --> 00:16:05,129
[TOBIO] Uh‐huh.
[SHOYO] What's with you?
Do you not want her to join?

295
00:16:05,229 --> 00:16:07,298
[TOBIO]
That would be Yachi's decision,
wouldn't it?

296
00:16:07,398 --> 00:16:12,036
[SHOYO]
(grunt) Man, no wonder you don't
have a girlfriend.

297
00:16:12,136 --> 00:16:14,305
[TOBIO]
(pissed) No one asked you!
(seething)

298
00:16:14,405 --> 00:16:17,809
[SHOYO]
Oh! Crap, I must've left my
textbook at Yachi's place...

299
00:16:17,909 --> 00:16:20,978
I better run back and grab it!
Later, Kageyama!

300
00:16:21,078 --> 00:16:26,183
(TOBIO annoyed) (yawn)

301
00:16:26,283 --> 00:16:28,986
[HITOKA] Here.
[SHOYO] Thanks, I really
appreciate it...

302
00:16:29,086 --> 00:16:31,322
That was close; I'm
so glad I remembered!

303
00:16:31,422 --> 00:16:35,693
[HITOKA]
Um... do you have a quick
second? I uh have a question.

304
00:16:35,793 --> 00:16:38,763
[SHOYO]
Huh? Yeah, sure.

305
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:42,033
[SHOYO]
Huh? You're afraid to join
for a dumb reason like that?

306
00:16:42,133 --> 00:16:44,035
(HITOKA wounded)

307
00:16:44,135 --> 00:16:48,139
[SHOYO]
I've messed up lots of times!
I hit Kageyama in the head with
the ball...

308
00:16:48,239 --> 00:16:50,374
[SHOYO]
I threw up in Tanaka's lap...

309
00:16:50,475 --> 00:16:52,744
[SHOYO]
...and knocked the
VP's toupee off!

310
00:16:52,844 --> 00:16:55,046
[SHOYO]
But that doesn't make
me bad at volleyball!

311
00:16:55,146 --> 00:16:57,615
[HITOKA]
Yeah I'm not sure if
that's the same thing.

312
00:16:57,715 --> 00:17:00,518
[SHOYO]
You do WANT to be our manager,
don't you?

313
00:17:00,618 --> 00:17:03,220
(HITOKA startled) (nod)

314
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,289
[SHOYO]
Then that's enough
reason to do it!

315
00:17:05,389 --> 00:17:08,860
[HITOKA]
Hmm... Maybe I... Mmm..

316
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:12,930
[SHOYO]
Hmm? I know, it's because of
something your mom said to you,
isn't it?

317
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:17,134
[HITOKA]
Uh, w‐well... How
should I put this...?

318
00:17:17,234 --> 00:17:19,036
[SHOYO]
I get it. We'll just ask her!

319
00:17:19,136 --> 00:17:20,572
(HITOKA startled)

320
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:27,779
[SHOYO]
She's at the train
station, right?

321
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,514
(HITOKA nervous affirmative)

322
00:17:29,614 --> 00:17:31,683
[HITOKA, internal]
This is just like something out
of a girls' manga!

323
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:35,019
Except the guy doesn't
usually run so fast!
(panicked running)

324
00:17:35,753 --> 00:17:38,790
(HITOKA stumbles, pant)

325
00:17:38,890 --> 00:17:40,458
Wait a second.

326
00:17:43,027 --> 00:17:45,362
Look, Yachi... you should
make your own choices.

327
00:17:45,463 --> 00:17:47,532
[SHOYO]
If you want to join then join!

328
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:54,305
[HITOKA]
Whether I join the
volleyball team or not,

329
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:58,510
if I keep thinking this
way, then nothing will
ever change for me!

330
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,046
[HITOKA]
I have to speak up for myself!

331
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:07,519
[HITOKA]
You're right. I'll talk to her.

332
00:18:08,753 --> 00:18:10,488
[HITOKA]
Thanks a lot, Hinata.

333
00:18:14,291 --> 00:18:18,029
[EMPLOYEE]
I'm guessing you didn't figure
out who you are right away
either, did you?

334
00:18:18,129 --> 00:18:21,232
[EMPLOYEE]
Well that's why I think it's
unfair of you to expect that
from your daughter.

335
00:18:21,332 --> 00:18:24,669
[EMPLOYEE]
Why don't you just let the girl
find herself in her own good
time?

336
00:18:24,769 --> 00:18:25,770
(MADOKA annoyed sigh)

337
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:28,806
[HITOKA]
MOOOOM! (heavy panting)

338
00:18:28,906 --> 00:18:29,841
[MADOKA]
Honey?!

339
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:30,975
(HITOKA heavy pant)

340
00:18:31,075 --> 00:18:32,510
(exhale) (inhale)

341
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,146
[HITOKA]
DON'T UNDERESTIMATE VILLAGER B!

342
00:18:35,246 --> 00:18:37,114
[MADOKA] Huh?
[EMPLOYEE] Who's Villager B?

343
00:18:37,214 --> 00:18:43,287
[HITOKA]
I'm sure now! I'm gonna be the
volleyball club's team manager!

344
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:47,725
(PEOPLE gawking)
[MADOKA] Ah... oh...
Good luck, dear.

345
00:18:47,825 --> 00:18:49,861
[HITOKA]
So... home for dinner?

346
00:18:49,961 --> 00:18:52,263
[MADOKA]
Uh. Yeah sure.

347
00:18:52,363 --> 00:18:53,965
[HITOKA] I'll have it ready!
(EMPLOYEE grins)

348
00:18:54,065 --> 00:18:55,733
(HITOKA shocked)

349
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:57,935
(SHOYO grin)

350
00:18:58,035 --> 00:18:59,571
(HITOKA giggle)

351
00:18:59,671 --> 00:19:03,074
[SHOYO]
All right! Two managers;
now we're in the big leagues!

352
00:19:03,174 --> 00:19:08,279
[HITOKA]
Um... Hinata? There's something
I need you and Kageyama to help
me with...

353
00:19:08,379 --> 00:19:09,814
[SHOYO]
What's up?

354
00:19:10,648 --> 00:19:12,149
[EMPLOYEE]
(shock) Are you crying?!

355
00:19:12,249 --> 00:19:14,318
[MADOKA]
No! Shut up. Get me a tissue.

356
00:19:14,418 --> 00:19:18,289
[HITOKA]
Excuse me! I have a thought.

357
00:19:18,389 --> 00:19:19,957
[TAKEDA]
Whatcha need?

358
00:19:20,057 --> 00:19:21,693
[HITOKA]
Um, I heard we were short

359
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:24,261
[HITOKA] on funding
for the Tokyo trip.
(TAKEDA surprised)

360
00:19:24,361 --> 00:19:28,165
[HITOKA]
I think I might have a solution.

361
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:31,235
[YU]
"Harold, he lies below but
can not open fire"...

362
00:19:31,335 --> 00:19:34,439
[YU] "Use this phrase to
memorize the elements"...
[RYUNOSUKE] "Savoir‐faire...
noun... tact in any situation."

363
00:19:34,539 --> 00:19:36,240
[YU]
Well, if you say so...

364
00:19:38,710 --> 00:19:40,778
[MADOKA]
You know that's completely
useless, right?

365
00:19:40,878 --> 00:19:42,313
[HITOKA]
Uh, whaddya mean?

366
00:19:42,413 --> 00:19:45,316
I wouldn't even give that
thing a second glance.

367
00:19:48,319 --> 00:19:51,589
[MADOKA]
So, what are you saying here?
Try to consider who your
audience is.

368
00:19:51,689 --> 00:19:56,193
[MADOKA]
What do you think will make
people stop in their tracks and
read what it has to say?

369
00:19:56,293 --> 00:19:57,762
(HITOKA thinking)

370
00:20:14,979 --> 00:20:17,715
(streetside chatter)

371
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:22,019
[ANNOUNCER]
He might be surrounded by
players as tall as 6'‐

372
00:20:22,119 --> 00:20:23,621
(SHOYO gasp)

373
00:20:25,557 --> 00:20:29,861
[HITOKA]
Um... Hinata? There's something
I need you and Kageyama to help
me with...

374
00:20:29,961 --> 00:20:33,565
[HITOKA]
What do you call that cool thing
when you jump and hit the
ball... a spike, right?

375
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:37,635
[HITOKA]
Could I maybe take a photo
of you guys doing that for
a poster?

376
00:20:39,437 --> 00:20:41,238
[HITOKA]
I'll take the picture
when you jump.

377
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,941
[SHOYO]
Okay! Ready, Kageyama?

378
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,276
[TOBIO]
Ready.

379
00:21:01,425 --> 00:21:03,728
[SHOYO]
Wow that's me.

380
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,037
(school bell ringing)

381
00:21:13,137 --> 00:21:14,939
(after test chatter)

382
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,207
[STUDENT A]
Sweet, it's over!

383
00:21:16,307 --> 00:21:17,742
[STUDENT B]
So how do you think you did?

384
00:21:17,842 --> 00:21:21,312
[TAKEDA] M'kay... please pass
your exam papers forward.

385
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,982
[TEACHER] Um, Mr. Takeda?
[TAKEDA] Oh?

386
00:21:25,082 --> 00:21:27,084
[TEACHER]
You've got a call...
Somebody saw a poster.

387
00:21:27,184 --> 00:21:30,955
They wanted to know the best
way to make a donation to the
volleyball club.

388
00:21:31,055 --> 00:21:33,124
(TAKEDA listening) (amazed)

389
00:21:33,224 --> 00:21:35,392
[SHOYO]
Ugh, it's hot...

390
00:21:35,493 --> 00:21:41,165
[KOSHI]
It's just for a second. You too,
Tsukishima... Let's all line up!
This way!

391
00:21:41,265 --> 00:21:43,801
[DAICHI]
Listen... Exams are over...

392
00:21:43,901 --> 00:21:48,706
Which means that Yachi's
officially coming on as a
team manager as of today.

393
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:50,174
[KIYOKO]
Here y'go.

394
00:21:50,274 --> 00:21:51,375
(HITOKA surprised)

395
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,845
(HITOKA gasps, tremoring)

396
00:21:53,945 --> 00:21:56,881
[DAICHI] Ahem, Readyyyy, go!
[HITOKA] Huh?

397
00:21:56,981 --> 00:22:00,552
[ALL]
Welcome to the Karasuno Boys'
Volleyball Club, Miss Manager!

398
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:05,189
[HITOKA]
(touched) I promise
I'll do my best!

399
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:11,663
[DAICHI]
Congrats... Next order of
business is Tokyo! Oh yeah,
but first...

400
00:22:11,763 --> 00:22:14,699
[TEACHER]
Okay... It's time to
hand back the exams guys.

401
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,867
(dramatic groaning)

402
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:17,735
[TEACHER]
Boo hoo whatever.

403
00:22:17,835 --> 00:22:19,136
First up is, Andoh.

404
00:22:19,236 --> 00:22:21,072
[ANDOH]
Here...

405
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:22,039
[TEACHER]
Enokida?

406
00:22:22,139 --> 00:22:23,040
[ENOKIDA]
Here.

407
00:22:23,140 --> 00:22:24,375
[TEACHER]
Ohyama?

408
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:57,268
[HITOKA]
Exam scores are coming in!

409
00:23:57,368 --> 00:23:58,636
[SHOYO]
Oh man...

410
00:23:58,736 --> 00:24:00,505
[HITOKA]
Don't worry! You
worked really hard!

411
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:02,540
[SHOYO]
Uh‐oh, I don't remember
writing my name...

412
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,477
[HITOKA]
What?! But that's the easiest
part of the test...

413
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,780
[HITOKA]
Next Haikyu!!
"Center Ace".
