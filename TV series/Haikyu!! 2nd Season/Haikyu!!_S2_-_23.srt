1
00:00:03,622 --> 00:00:05,624
[Irihata]:
I'm sure you're tired
of hearing this,

2
00:00:05,724 --> 00:00:07,992
but you need to be more
aggressive with those serves.

3
00:00:08,092 --> 00:00:11,963
I know their Number 10 is giving
us a lot of problems so...

4
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,732
narrow his options.

5
00:00:13,832 --> 00:00:14,866
Right!

6
00:00:16,835 --> 00:00:20,539
Be on your toes.
You guys can do this.

7
00:00:20,639 --> 00:00:21,940
Yessir!

8
00:00:26,244 --> 00:00:30,515
[Keishin]:
Be alert, and don't let Oikawa's
serves intimidate you.

9
00:00:30,615 --> 00:00:36,020
However high or hard he hits,
get under it, and dig it up!

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,421
Right!

11
00:00:37,522 --> 00:00:39,891
Some of you consider this
long‐standing rivalry

12
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:41,492
a mighty burden to carry...

13
00:00:41,593 --> 00:00:44,796
[Takeda]:
But in reality, it's
actually beneficial for us.

14
00:00:44,896 --> 00:00:48,166
Honestly, we have
Aoba Johsai to thank.

15
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:50,401
They've motivated us
to sharpen our skills.

16
00:00:50,502 --> 00:00:52,270
So let's show off
what we've learned!

17
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:54,472
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

18
00:00:54,573 --> 00:00:59,811
It's the final set! Just one big
push and we can overtake them!

19
00:00:59,911 --> 00:01:03,447
With this team,
anything is possible!

20
00:01:04,282 --> 00:01:07,218
[Daichi]:
Karasuno, fight!

21
00:01:07,318 --> 00:01:09,854
Fiiight!

22
00:02:44,883 --> 00:02:46,951
[Takinoue]:
Okay, here we go...

23
00:02:47,051 --> 00:02:51,122
[Shimada]:
Yeah. This will decide exactly
where we stand against Seijoh.

24
00:02:52,891 --> 00:02:54,125
You can do it!

25
00:02:54,225 --> 00:02:55,994
You got this, Asahi!

26
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:10,174
[Yahaba]:
Oikawa, get us a point!

27
00:03:10,274 --> 00:03:13,578
No matter what,
just get the ball up.

28
00:03:13,678 --> 00:03:15,747
We've been trailing
behind them the whole game.

29
00:03:15,847 --> 00:03:19,751
[Koshi]:
Come on, guys... we gotta
turn it around right here!

30
00:03:22,687 --> 00:03:26,858
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

31
00:03:28,059 --> 00:03:29,093
His serves are so fast...!

32
00:03:29,193 --> 00:03:31,530
I see 'em coming, but I
feel like I'm reacting

33
00:03:31,630 --> 00:03:32,764
in slow‐motion.

34
00:03:32,864 --> 00:03:34,766
[Hajime]:
Mad Dog, take it!

35
00:03:40,772 --> 00:03:44,909
All right, Mad Dog's engine
is still revved up.

36
00:03:45,009 --> 00:03:48,847
Man, can you believe the arm
this guy? He just won't let up.

37
00:03:48,947 --> 00:03:51,182
Come on... hang
in there guys!

38
00:03:51,282 --> 00:03:52,551
Karasuno, let's fight!

39
00:03:52,651 --> 00:03:55,186
[Hajime]:
Oikawa, get us one more!

40
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:01,459
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

41
00:04:03,027 --> 00:04:04,095
All right!

42
00:04:04,195 --> 00:04:06,297
Oh, it's up!

43
00:04:06,397 --> 00:04:07,699
[Asahi]:
Cover!

44
00:04:12,370 --> 00:04:15,473
YEEEAAAAAAH!

45
00:04:16,307 --> 00:04:17,576
Finally stopped
their flow!

46
00:04:17,676 --> 00:04:20,378
Nice one!
Good one, Bro!

47
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,046
[Ryunosuke]:
Would you calm down?!

48
00:04:23,915 --> 00:04:25,316
All right, good
work, you guys!

49
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:27,451
[Daichi]:
Tsukishima! You're up!

50
00:04:27,552 --> 00:04:29,253
Oh, right.

51
00:04:30,388 --> 00:04:32,657
[Koshi]:
Go for it, Tsukishima!

52
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,161
Got it!

53
00:04:37,261 --> 00:04:38,963
Mad Dog, yours!

54
00:04:45,269 --> 00:04:49,040
Nice kill!
As always, when Mad Dog is
playing up on the front line,

55
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,075
you can just feel the energy
coming off of him.

56
00:04:51,175 --> 00:04:53,344
[Matsukawa]:
Sure would be nice if
he could play like this

57
00:04:53,444 --> 00:04:54,813
for the entire game.

58
00:04:57,448 --> 00:05:00,952
[Keishin]:
Their ace has both
power and technique.

59
00:05:01,052 --> 00:05:04,022
And Number 16 is both a
powerhouse and a decoy.

60
00:05:04,122 --> 00:05:06,324
He's hard for us
to get a good read on...

61
00:05:06,424 --> 00:05:07,826
Then of course there's Oikawa.

62
00:05:07,926 --> 00:05:10,695
His serves are what
can really do us in.

63
00:05:10,795 --> 00:05:12,631
We have to break
them down somewhere,

64
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:14,465
or they will break us!

65
00:05:14,566 --> 00:05:16,901
[Irihata]:
It's clear both sides
are pretty equally matched.

66
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:19,037
When playing at this
high of a skill level,

67
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:22,040
it doesn't take much...
even the smallest misstep...

68
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:25,343
...Can turn into
a fatal blow.
...can turn into
a fatal blow.

69
00:05:25,443 --> 00:05:28,580
[Keishin/Irihata]:
Sink your teeth in and hold on!

70
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:34,185
This final set is turning out
to be a nail‐biter, too.

71
00:05:34,285 --> 00:05:37,522
Man, Karasuno hasn't been able
to take the lead once.

72
00:05:37,622 --> 00:05:41,693
They have to be tenacious and
not fall even further behind.

73
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,863
[Koshi]:
Asahi! Serve
us up a point!

74
00:05:53,437 --> 00:05:54,539
Yeah!

75
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,540
Whoa!

76
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,810
Wow! Nice shot!

77
00:05:58,910 --> 00:06:02,547
We can't let that bother us
now, we'll get next one.

78
00:06:02,647 --> 00:06:05,183
[Koshi]:
Asahi, get us another one!

79
00:06:10,154 --> 00:06:11,022
It's up!

80
00:06:11,122 --> 00:06:12,724
[Hajime]:
Nice receive!

81
00:06:17,962 --> 00:06:18,897
Dammit.

82
00:06:18,997 --> 00:06:21,132
[Keishin]:
There he goes again.

83
00:06:29,007 --> 00:06:33,177
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

84
00:06:34,813 --> 00:06:38,249
Yes! This is their chance
to shut down his serves!

85
00:06:38,349 --> 00:06:39,684
Comin' your way!

86
00:06:39,784 --> 00:06:41,753
[Toru]:
They're comin' with
a fast attack!

87
00:06:41,853 --> 00:06:43,988
[Watari]:
Nice receive, Oikawa!

88
00:06:44,088 --> 00:06:45,824
[Hanamaki]:
Take it Kyotani!

89
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:47,626
[Ryunosuke]:
Right, right!

90
00:06:47,726 --> 00:06:48,927
Tanaka.

91
00:06:49,027 --> 00:06:50,061
Huh?

92
00:06:56,234 --> 00:06:57,869
Great stuff, you guys!

93
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:00,038
They did it!
Yes! They ended it!

94
00:07:00,138 --> 00:07:03,808
Woah, did Tsukishima and Tanaka
switch places on that block?
Nice block, you guys!

95
00:07:03,908 --> 00:07:05,877
Yeah! I wonder
if he predicted

96
00:07:05,977 --> 00:07:07,679
[Shimada]:
that a line shot
would be coming?

97
00:07:07,779 --> 00:07:10,381
I thought so...
Nice going, Tsukki!

98
00:07:11,415 --> 00:07:12,851
Y'see that?

99
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:15,019
Tanaka has been going after
Number 16 pretty hard.

100
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:17,822
Hm? Y'mean like picking
a fight with the guy?

101
00:07:17,922 --> 00:07:19,457
[Chikara]:
I noticed during the second set,

102
00:07:19,558 --> 00:07:22,493
he had aimed for him and
forced them into a ricochet.

103
00:07:22,594 --> 00:07:26,097
He also blatantly nailed a
narrow shot right next to him.

104
00:07:26,197 --> 00:07:28,733
Even though there weren't any
blockers for a cross‐court shot.

105
00:07:28,833 --> 00:07:30,835
[Yu]:
Seriously? I didn't
pick up on it!

106
00:07:30,935 --> 00:07:33,004
[Chikara]:
You could tell Number 16 was
getting pissed and started

107
00:07:33,104 --> 00:07:35,774
making more line shots
right back at Tanaka.

108
00:07:35,874 --> 00:07:38,910
It seems Tsukishima
caught onto that as well.

109
00:07:40,745 --> 00:07:42,681
[Ryunosuke]:
(hearty laughter)

110
00:07:42,781 --> 00:07:45,316
Read that like
a book, Tsukishima!

111
00:07:45,416 --> 00:07:46,518
I'm proud of ya!

112
00:07:46,618 --> 00:07:49,353
[Kei]:
Uh... right.

113
00:07:49,453 --> 00:07:54,158
[Keishin]:
All right, now we can get back
the momentum. Don't lose it!

114
00:07:55,193 --> 00:07:56,795
I've got it!

115
00:07:56,895 --> 00:07:58,329
Yeah, alright!

116
00:07:58,429 --> 00:08:01,199
[Daichi]:
Number 16! 16!

117
00:08:01,299 --> 00:08:04,302
[Toru]:
You're going to have to get
the point back yourself!

118
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:07,138
It's out.

119
00:08:10,775 --> 00:08:12,511
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

120
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:14,078
[Keishin]:
Okay, here it is!

121
00:08:14,178 --> 00:08:15,880
[Takeda]:
Yes! We flipped the lead!

122
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:18,416
Kill it, boys,
let's goooo!
Yeahhh!

123
00:08:18,517 --> 00:08:23,321
Number 16 is pretty worked
up now. Just look at him.

124
00:08:25,023 --> 00:08:27,892
Can it be... that Tanaka was
tilting him intentionally?

125
00:08:27,992 --> 00:08:31,495
Not quite. While I have
no doubt he was provoking him...

126
00:08:31,596 --> 00:08:33,297
I don't think
it was deliberate.

127
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:36,968
That's just how...
Tanaka normally is.

128
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:43,875
[Chikara]:
And I guess Tsukishima
used Tanaka's personality

129
00:08:43,975 --> 00:08:45,744
to our advantage.

130
00:08:45,844 --> 00:08:48,146
[Keishin]:
Seijoh seemed
solid as a rock,

131
00:08:48,246 --> 00:08:50,214
but now we are starting
to see a crack!

132
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:53,685
This is our chance
to bring them down!

133
00:08:53,785 --> 00:08:55,353
Let's keep the lead up!

134
00:08:55,453 --> 00:08:57,421
All right!

135
00:08:57,522 --> 00:08:59,423
(whistle)

136
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,280
[Gossiping Girl 1]:
Who's that? He
looks kinda, ugh.

137
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,483
[Gossiping Guy 1]:
I'm not sure. He said he
just wants to practice with us.

138
00:09:25,584 --> 00:09:27,719
[Gossiping Guy 2]:
I saw him with a
different club on Saturday.

139
00:09:27,819 --> 00:09:30,589
[Gossiping Girl 1]:
Well, if he's in high school,
what about his own team?

140
00:09:30,689 --> 00:09:33,892
Uh long story short, he doesn't
really get along with them.

141
00:09:33,992 --> 00:09:35,894
So... A
rebellious stage!

142
00:09:35,994 --> 00:09:38,396
I'm surprised he's
playing a team sport.

143
00:09:38,496 --> 00:09:42,366
Well, I assume... there must be
some kind of allure for him.

144
00:09:42,466 --> 00:09:44,969
Oh... uh Kiyoshi... Hey.

145
00:09:45,069 --> 00:09:46,404
Must be a big deal for him

146
00:09:46,505 --> 00:09:49,073
to come all the way
here to practice.

147
00:09:53,144 --> 00:09:57,916
Japan! Japan! Japan...!

148
00:10:18,036 --> 00:10:21,606
Well... we're always short on
having enough guys to play...

149
00:10:21,706 --> 00:10:22,907
Should be fine.

150
00:10:23,007 --> 00:10:25,009
And he's better
than us, anyway.

151
00:10:25,109 --> 00:10:27,345
[Gossiping Guy 1]:
Huh?! We are not
gonna lose, okay!

152
00:10:27,445 --> 00:10:30,048
[Gossiping Girl 1]:
Aww, does that hurt
your little boy feelings?

153
00:10:30,148 --> 00:10:31,616
[Gossiping Guy 1]:
Shut up!

154
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:37,856
[Daichi]:
Give it to 'em, Tsukishima!

155
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:41,459
Got it!

156
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:43,261
It's yours, Mad Dog!

[Team Karasuno]
(cheering)

158
00:10:47,632 --> 00:10:49,634
[Spectator 1]:
Even with th time‐out,
he's no good.

159
00:10:49,734 --> 00:10:52,203
[Spectator 2]:
Maybe it's impossible
for him to do more...

160
00:10:52,303 --> 00:10:54,305
Since Seijoh's has
plenty of substitutes.

161
00:10:54,405 --> 00:10:57,108
Maybe it's time they
pulled him back out.

162
00:10:57,876 --> 00:10:59,511
It's fine. Relax.

163
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,515
Go scold Mad Dog!

164
00:11:04,348 --> 00:11:06,585
(whistle)

165
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,329
If you want to get
back on the court, son...

166
00:11:18,429 --> 00:11:21,132
you'll need to
check your attitude.

167
00:11:27,939 --> 00:11:30,041
Get yourself
together already...

168
00:11:30,141 --> 00:11:32,276
We've got our backs
to the wall now.

169
00:11:33,211 --> 00:11:37,248
Yeah, whatever...
Who cares?

170
00:11:37,348 --> 00:11:40,985
Yahaba, please... could you
just go a little easy on him.

171
00:11:43,087 --> 00:11:47,291
Rather not... Sorry.

172
00:11:47,391 --> 00:11:50,261
[Yahaba]:
Falling for the opponent's
taunt, getting worked up,

173
00:11:50,361 --> 00:11:52,831
and self‐destructing?
That's lame.

174
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:55,466
What did you say?

175
00:11:55,567 --> 00:11:57,736
The way you saunter
back onto the court...

176
00:11:57,836 --> 00:12:01,372
with no regard to the kind
of crap you may have pulled...

177
00:12:01,472 --> 00:12:03,274
Well, y'know not
everybody's gonna stand

178
00:12:03,374 --> 00:12:06,578
for that kind of garbage...
I know I won't.

179
00:12:08,046 --> 00:12:11,149
That said...

180
00:12:11,249 --> 00:12:13,317
[Matsukawa]:
It's not like he
caused any real problems...

181
00:12:13,417 --> 00:12:15,253
so if we're able to
use him during a game,

182
00:12:15,353 --> 00:12:16,788
it should be
okay, right?

183
00:12:16,888 --> 00:12:19,791
You sure he can keep up
with our practice though?

184
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:21,392
He's been on break.

185
00:12:21,492 --> 00:12:24,395
Well, he's never on break
from being an asshole.

186
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:26,698
Well...

187
00:12:28,366 --> 00:12:32,436
Those are not the moves of a guy
who hasn't been practicing.

188
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:38,042
I thought it was
a cold‐hearted move,

189
00:12:38,142 --> 00:12:40,545
both against us
and against you.

190
00:12:40,645 --> 00:12:43,447
[Yahaba]:
But that's not
the problem at all.

191
00:12:43,548 --> 00:12:46,985
People we need most
become the regular members.

192
00:12:48,119 --> 00:12:50,288
And you were chosen.

193
00:12:52,156 --> 00:12:54,826
So I suggest you
earn your keep.

194
00:12:54,926 --> 00:12:58,730
Man, he's gonna freak out and
pound Yahaba into a bloody pulp!

195
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,031
Could get ugly.

196
00:13:00,131 --> 00:13:01,432
You should go try
and stop him..

197
00:13:01,533 --> 00:13:02,634
Hell no!

198
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:06,771
But then, that's
all superficial.

199
00:13:06,871 --> 00:13:08,206
Huh?

200
00:13:11,676 --> 00:13:15,046
If you sling mud onto our
upperclassmen's big game...

201
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,582
then I will never,
ever forgive you!

202
00:13:23,487 --> 00:13:27,526
Well now... Turns out you
actually do give a damn.

203
00:13:27,626 --> 00:13:30,194
Well you at least
got that much right...

204
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:33,732
Each and every one of us should
respect their upperclassmen.

lose goes for the whole team.

He's kind of off today.
What should we do?

223
00:14:38,697 --> 00:14:42,133
We don't have anyone else with
that much attack power, y'know?

224
00:14:42,233 --> 00:14:44,168
Yeah but if his condition
gets any worse,

Oikawa's so sadistic.

00:15:07,759 --> 00:15:11,563
They relentlessly depend
on him without question...

234
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:20,705
It's been a while since you came
here, lone wolf high school kid.

So uh... I heard you're
going to Aoba‐Johsai...

237

They're a real powerhouse.
I couldn't get in there.

238
00:15:31,783 --> 00:15:34,519
You're running away from your
team and practicing here

239
00:15:34,619 --> 00:15:37,088
and there with no set home.

240
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:39,758
You sure picked
the easy way.

241

Huh?!

242
00:15:41,292 --> 00:15:43,828
A team is reliable...
They're allies...

243
00:15:43,928 --> 00:15:48,232
but then at the same time, they
can be a real pain in the ass...

244
00:15:48,332 --> 00:15:49,768
That's for sure.

245
00:15:49,868 --> 00:15:51,903
Until you learn how to
deal with that head‐on...

246
00:15:52,003 --> 00:15:55,206
you can't really play
the game, y'know?

00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:08,553
[Kiyoshi]:
You need to face the team,
and the team needs to face you.

248
00:16:08,653 --> 00:16:11,222
If you can do that,
you can butt heads

249
00:16:11,322 --> 00:16:13,057
and become stronger as a result.

250
00:16:13,157 --> 00:16:15,126
Yeah!

251
00:16:15,226 --> 00:16:19,598

And, if you can do that,
remember that you're lucky.

252
00:16:21,633 --> 00:16:24,769
Teams like that aren't
lying around everywhere.

Thanks.

261

Y'know if that Number 16
was a part of our team...

262
00:17:01,239 --> 00:17:02,607
I can't help but wonder...

263
00:17:02,707 --> 00:17:05,043
how we would all handle
the same situation.

Gotta admit... Oikawa really is
good at what he does, huh?

[Team Seijoh]:
Yeah!

267
00:17:13,117 --> 00:17:16,387
Up to this point... that 16
looked like an outlier...

268
00:17:16,487 --> 00:17:18,489
but during that
last play we saw,

269
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:21,292
it's like the guy
is a perfect fit.

270
00:17:21,392 --> 00:17:22,661
I don't like it...

271
00:17:22,761 --> 00:17:24,729
In terms of total
team power...

272
00:17:24,829 --> 00:17:28,867
we're not out of this thing yet,
Coach. Keep watching.

273
00:17:31,836 --> 00:17:33,271

If the window is narrowed
down or read correctly,

294

Yeah.

Dammit! They're going
for the quick!

312
00:19:24,015 --> 00:19:25,617
Kindaichi!

313
00:19:27,418 --> 00:19:28,252
Dammit.

314
00:19:28,352 --> 00:19:29,654
Shake it off!

315
00:19:29,754 --> 00:19:32,323
If you have a request
for me, just say it!

316
00:19:32,423 --> 00:19:36,861
Oikawa will fix things if I just
tell him. I gotta let him know.

317
00:19:37,829 --> 00:19:40,565
Um... Oikawa...
I don't know what it was,

318
00:19:40,665 --> 00:19:42,767
but the last one felt like
it was a little tough

319
00:19:42,867 --> 00:19:44,402
to connect with.

320
00:19:44,503 --> 00:19:46,971
Huh... okay, then.

321
00:19:47,071 --> 00:19:50,441
[Toru]:
But, let's try it for
a little longer, okay?

322
00:19:51,676 --> 00:19:54,045
Your point of impact is going
to be further out!

323
00:19:54,145 --> 00:19:57,749
About one ball width.
Try it like that.

324
00:20:00,151 --> 00:20:02,554
Yeah!
All Right!

325
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,055
A snappy broad jump.

326
00:20:04,155 --> 00:20:06,525
Kindaichi's moving
differently than he did during

327
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,959
the Inter‐High prelims.

328
00:20:08,059 --> 00:20:09,961
Shake it off!
You can end it right here!

329
00:20:10,061 --> 00:20:11,395
C'mon! Concentrate!

330
00:20:11,495 --> 00:20:13,131
It's a side‐out!

331
00:20:13,231 --> 00:20:15,600
At the last second Seijoh was
able to turn this thing around!

332
00:20:16,334 --> 00:20:17,836
This is rough...

333
00:20:17,936 --> 00:20:20,204
It's becoming a tug‐o‐war
between the two teams now.

334
00:20:20,304 --> 00:20:25,143
True... I guess... Oikawa raises
the standard of the entire team

335
00:20:25,243 --> 00:20:26,611
by his own merit.

336
00:20:26,711 --> 00:20:28,780
[Takeda]:
He really is something else.

337
00:20:31,215 --> 00:20:33,985
I get why you'd say that.

338
00:20:34,085 --> 00:20:38,322
[Keishin]:
But it's not even close to
the total strength of our team!

339
00:20:38,422 --> 00:20:43,962
[Watari]:
Give 'em hell, Oikawa!
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

340
00:20:44,062 --> 00:20:45,797
My bad! Tsukishima!

341
00:20:45,897 --> 00:20:48,032
[Hajime]:
This one's yours,
Kindaichi!

342
00:20:53,371 --> 00:20:55,239
Thanks a lot, pal!

343
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:58,076
It's all you, Hinata!

344
00:20:58,176 --> 00:20:59,477
Okay!

345
00:20:59,578 --> 00:21:01,145
[Hajime]:
Let's shut this down!

346
00:21:01,245 --> 00:21:03,047
[Team Seijoh]:
Yeah!

347
00:21:03,147 --> 00:21:05,449
The Great King really
is a special guy.

348
00:21:05,550 --> 00:21:07,619
And how would
you know?

349
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,754
[Shoyo]:
I can just tell.

350
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:15,594
But still...!

351
00:21:15,694 --> 00:21:18,963
With me around...
you can beat anyone!

352
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:24,636
Huh... Y'know, that
was kinda cool.

353
00:21:25,269 --> 00:21:27,005
If you say so...

354
00:21:28,172 --> 00:21:31,242
You're getting dug up
all over the place.

355
00:21:31,342 --> 00:21:32,744
Yeah, well...!

356
00:21:32,844 --> 00:21:35,780
Gettin' all ballsy
for no reason... Yeah, man!

357
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,616
[Shoyo]:
I‐I have a ballsy reason!

358
00:21:37,716 --> 00:21:40,552
[Ryunosuke]:
I bet you do!
(laughs)

359
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:44,422
I got it!

360
00:21:44,523 --> 00:21:46,925
Nice receive. Mad Dog!

361
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:51,129
Nice one‐touch!

362
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:53,765
I got it!

363
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,536
Bring it to me!

364
00:22:00,639 --> 00:22:03,808
I jumped too far!
The net's too close!

365
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,550
The ball's too
close to the net!

366
00:22:11,650 --> 00:22:13,351
[Koshi]:
It's right on top of it!

367
00:22:13,451 --> 00:22:15,453
[Tobio]:
No one's there!

368
00:22:15,554 --> 00:22:17,722
Slam it down!
To the front!

369
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:59,390
[Shoyo]:
It's the final set,
and the score is 17‐16.

370
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:00,759
We're coming to the end!

371
00:24:00,859 --> 00:24:02,460
[Tobio]:
Yeah.
[Shoyo]:
We're gonna win!

372
00:24:02,561 --> 00:24:04,228
Yeah.
Bring all the sets to me!

373
00:24:04,328 --> 00:24:06,998
[Tobio]:
Next Haikyu!! ‐
"Switch for the Utmost Limit"

374
00:24:07,098 --> 00:24:09,500
[Shoyo]:
You did hear that
last part, right?!

375
00:24:09,601 --> 00:24:10,702
[Tobio]:
Huh?
