1
00:00:11,353 --> 00:00:15,390
[BULLY A]
What's up, Tadashi?
You want some anchovies
for that Pizza face!

2
00:00:15,490 --> 00:00:18,127
[BULLY B]
Man, you're such a
wimpy little dork!

3
00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:23,198
[BULLY B]
If you don't like it, then you
better toughen up... Why don't
you carry our stuff?

4
00:00:25,635 --> 00:00:28,003
(YOUNG TADASHI tearing
up into whimpering)
[BULLY B] Dude, he's crying!

5
00:00:28,103 --> 00:00:30,139
[BULLY A]
This guy cries over everything!

6
00:00:30,239 --> 00:00:33,475
[BULLY B]
(laughing) Cry baby!

7
00:00:33,576 --> 00:00:35,511
(TADASHI sniffles) (surprised)

8
00:00:36,045 --> 00:00:37,913
[BULLIES]
Huh?

9
00:00:38,013 --> 00:00:39,515
[BULLY B]
What are you lookin' at?!

10
00:00:39,615 --> 00:00:41,551
[BULLY A]
(nervous) I think he's
older than us!

11
00:00:41,651 --> 00:00:45,187
[BULLY B]
Nah, he's in Class 3.

12
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:47,523
[YOUNG KEI]
(smirk) That's so lame.

13
00:00:47,623 --> 00:00:49,458
[BULLIES & YOUNG TADASHI]
Uh?

14
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:52,595
[BULLY B]
What's so lame?!

15
00:00:52,695 --> 00:00:55,097
[BULLY B]
Wait! I'm talkin' to you!

16
00:00:55,665 --> 00:00:56,966
[KEI]
What?

17
00:00:57,066 --> 00:00:59,769
[BULLY B]
(startled) (catches breath)
Well...

18
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:03,205
[BULLY B]
Your glasses are stupid! Get
outta here, Four Eyes!

19
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,607
(KEI cracks up)

20
00:01:04,707 --> 00:01:06,876
[BULLY A]
H‐hey, wait for me! (scared)

21
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:14,850
[TADASHI]
To this day, I'm not exactly
sure if Tsukishima was calling
me lame too. Hmm. Anyway...

22
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,586
[TADASHI]
But what stood out to me was
that,

23
00:01:16,686 --> 00:01:18,020
even though he was outnumbered,

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,890
he had the guts to say
that all by himself.

25
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:24,827
Seeing that really made
me envy him in a way.

26
00:01:24,927 --> 00:01:27,530
[TADASHI]
I wanted to be brave
like that too.

27
00:01:28,864 --> 00:01:33,235
What about you... what would you
say... What would you tell him?

28
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:17,907
[KEI]
Hey... I'm leaving.

29
00:03:18,007 --> 00:03:19,909
[DAICHI] Alright.
[KOSHI] Good work!

30
00:03:20,009 --> 00:03:21,677
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey, Tsukishima!

31
00:03:21,777 --> 00:03:25,214
We're gonna work on that
synced attack now...
You're not leaving yet.

32
00:03:25,314 --> 00:03:28,217
(KEI slight annoyed)
[CHIKARA] I can stay
a while, too.

33
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:31,587
As long as you don't mind having
three wing spikers at once.

34
00:03:31,687 --> 00:03:34,089
[CHIKARA]
I want to get that
timing locked in.

35
00:03:34,189 --> 00:03:38,027
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh?! Oh, I see!
You're after my spot!

36
00:03:38,127 --> 00:03:41,564
Oh come on, you can't expect me
to be a benchwarmer forever.

37
00:03:41,664 --> 00:03:46,035
[RYUNOSUKE]
(taken aback) All right,
that's it! You're goin'
down! Let's go, Daichi!

38
00:03:46,135 --> 00:03:48,370
[DAICHI] Let me rest a
little first, would ya?
[KOSHI] See ya later!

39
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:53,042
[RYUNOSUKE]
But Captain! Some of us can't
afford to sit back and watch
like you can!

40
00:03:58,614 --> 00:04:00,182
[KEI]
It's just a game.

41
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:05,688
[IZUMIDATE A]
Left, left!

42
00:04:05,788 --> 00:04:08,457
[IZUMIDATE B]
Number 4!

43
00:04:08,558 --> 00:04:10,960
(CROWD cheers)
[MOTHER A] My, that
Tsukishima's good!

44
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,895
[MOTHER B]
Well, he is the ace!

45
00:04:12,995 --> 00:04:14,263
[AMEMARU 6]
Nice kill, bro!

46
00:04:14,363 --> 00:04:15,865
[AMEMARU 5]
Good one!

47
00:04:17,567 --> 00:04:19,669
(KEI proud grin)

48
00:04:23,906 --> 00:04:25,775
[KEI]
Which high school
are you going to?

49
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,442
[AKITERU]
Karasuno... These days,

50
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:30,713
I think they'll even give
Shiratorizawa a run for their
money!

51
00:04:30,813 --> 00:04:33,783
[AKITERU]
And I'll make sure we
go to nationals too!

52
00:04:34,216 --> 00:04:35,685
(KEI proud)

53
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:47,062
[AKITERU]
(exhausted sigh) I'm back!

54
00:04:47,963 --> 00:04:49,532
[KEI]
Hey, welcome home!

55
00:04:49,632 --> 00:04:51,100
[KEI]
You stayed late again?

56
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:54,069
Everyone's so good, I have
to work really hard to catch up.

57
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:57,907
And Coach Ukai's a drill
sergeant... But still!

58
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,009
[AKITERU]
I gotta do whatever it
takes to make it happen.

59
00:05:00,109 --> 00:05:03,946
[KEI]
There's a whole lot of guys on
the team... It'd be so cool if
you could do that!

60
00:05:04,046 --> 00:05:06,148
[AKITERU]
I know, right?

61
00:05:06,248 --> 00:05:07,950
[AKITERU] Hey mom!
[MOM] Welcome home!

62
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:09,785
[AKITERU]
Can I have three lunches
again tomorrow?

63
00:05:09,885 --> 00:05:12,154
One for morning drills,
lunchtime, and team practice?

64
00:05:12,254 --> 00:05:15,090
[KEI'S MOM]
Sure thing! High in protein and
low in fat, right, son?

65
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,426
[AKITERU]
Perfect! Thanks a lot!

66
00:05:22,898 --> 00:05:24,600
[KEI]
Today, the lady at the
butcher shop said

67
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:28,270
"You're the little brother
of that great Karasuno
player, aren't you?"

68
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:30,239
[AKITERU]
Oh yeah?

69
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:33,375
[KEI]
You have a game tomorrow, right?
Can I come watch you?

70
00:05:33,475 --> 00:05:36,779
[AKITERU]
(mulling it over) Sorry, I think
you'd throw me off.

71
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:44,019
[KEI]
(disappointed) Hey, what
position do you play now?
The same as in middle school?

72
00:05:44,119 --> 00:05:45,087
[AKITERU]
Yeah, that's right.

73
00:05:45,187 --> 00:05:47,122
[KEI]
Then, you're the ace!

74
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,494
[AKITERU]
Kinda.

75
00:05:52,595 --> 00:05:54,463
(KEI grins, caught off guard)

76
00:05:54,564 --> 00:05:57,733
[AKITERU]
You joined the boy scouts' team
the other day, right? What do
you do?

77
00:05:57,833 --> 00:05:59,669
[KEI]
Receiving... It sucks.

78
00:05:59,769 --> 00:06:01,070
[AKITERU]
In the beginning,
they don't quite

79
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,072
go the way you want
them to, right?

80
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:04,774
[AKITERU]
Stand over there for me.

81
00:06:04,874 --> 00:06:05,941
[KEI]
Huh?

82
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,376
[AKITERU]
Ready?

83
00:06:09,645 --> 00:06:11,313
(KEI sighs)

84
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:12,582
[AKITERU]
Look...

85
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:14,850
Don't try to push it up
with your arms.

86
00:06:14,950 --> 00:06:16,619
[AKITERU]
First you gotta drop your waist
a little...

87
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:20,389
Then use your whole body to send
it out... Try tossing it to me.

88
00:06:26,428 --> 00:06:27,697
[KEI]
Whoa!

89
00:06:27,797 --> 00:06:29,331
[AKITERU]
It all starts with the receive.

90
00:06:29,431 --> 00:06:31,166
[AKITERU]
And communication is
everything...

91
00:06:31,266 --> 00:06:33,836
Are you friends with the other
kids on the team? At all?

92
00:06:33,936 --> 00:06:35,671
[KEI]
(awkward) Yeah, duh.

93
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:37,006
[AKITERU]
Nice try!

94
00:06:37,106 --> 00:06:38,808
[AKITERU]
You're not a very good
liar, kid.

95
00:06:38,908 --> 00:06:40,475
[KEI]
Man...

96
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:45,615
(practice)

97
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:47,149
[KEI]
Hm?

98
00:06:49,318 --> 00:06:50,185
[KEI]
Excuse me.

99
00:06:50,285 --> 00:06:53,088
[TADASHI]
(shocked) Uhhh... wait!

100
00:06:53,188 --> 00:06:55,591
Thank you for
the other day!

101
00:06:55,691 --> 00:06:59,028
[KEI]
Hmm? (startled) Do I know you?

102
00:06:59,128 --> 00:07:01,931
[TADASHI]
(shocked) Y‐Yeah...

103
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:05,167
Well, not really...
W‐we met at the park...!

104
00:07:05,267 --> 00:07:07,336
[KEI]
Oh... Okay, what
are you doing here?

105
00:07:07,436 --> 00:07:11,674
Uh... Well... I wanted to
play a sport too...

106
00:07:11,774 --> 00:07:15,911
But baseball and soccer had
a lot of big scary guys so...

107
00:07:16,011 --> 00:07:18,380
[TADASHI]
So I thought I'd be okay here.

108
00:07:19,515 --> 00:07:22,985
[TADASHI]
Hey! Your shoes are really cool!

109
00:07:23,085 --> 00:07:25,588
I always just use the ones
they give you in gym class.

110
00:07:25,688 --> 00:07:30,059
[KEI]
They're my big brother's...
I'm just wearing them until I
get some new ones next week.

111
00:07:30,159 --> 00:07:32,762
[TADASHI]
Oh your brother plays
volleyball?

112
00:07:32,862 --> 00:07:39,134
[KEI]
He's playing at a powerhouse
called Karasuno High School...
And uh... he's... the ace.

113
00:07:39,234 --> 00:07:41,704
[TADASHI]
(impressed) At a school like
that?!

114
00:07:41,804 --> 00:07:44,006
Dude.. that's awesome!
(fascinated)

115
00:07:44,106 --> 00:07:45,541
[KEI]
It... it's nothing...

116
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:48,010
It's not a big deal...
He's always been like that!

117
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,279
[TADASHI]
No way!

118
00:07:50,379 --> 00:07:53,115
[TADASHI]
So he played in middle school?
Was he on this team?

119
00:07:53,215 --> 00:07:55,518
Wow, I can't believe it!

120
00:07:56,185 --> 00:07:57,553
(door sliding open)

121
00:07:57,653 --> 00:07:58,788
[AKITERU]
I'm home.

122
00:07:58,888 --> 00:08:00,122
(door closing)

123
00:08:00,222 --> 00:08:02,257
So how was the
practice match today?

124
00:08:02,357 --> 00:08:05,661
[AKITERU]
Oh yeah it was pretty great!
I landed a ton of spikes!

125
00:08:05,761 --> 00:08:08,097
[KEI]
That's awesome!

126
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,967
[KEI]
Let's practice!

127
00:08:12,067 --> 00:08:14,504
[AKITERU]
Um... uh after we eat.

128
00:08:17,006 --> 00:08:18,473
[KEI]
Tadashi.

129
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:20,409
[BOY A] What was the
next class again?
[BOY B] Japanese.

130
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:23,478
[KEI]
Let's go watch Karasuno play
tomorrow... Cool?

131
00:08:23,579 --> 00:08:26,816
[BOY A] Huh?
[KEI] My brother keeps saying
he'll get nervous if I go.

132
00:08:26,916 --> 00:08:30,085
[KEI]
But he's a third‐year, so
this'll be the last chance
for me to see him play.

133
00:08:30,185 --> 00:08:34,256
[TADASHI]
(excited) Sure! I still
haven't actually seen
one of the games yet!

134
00:08:34,356 --> 00:08:39,061
[BOY A]
Your brother plays volleyball
for Karasuno High School? My
brother does too!

135
00:08:39,161 --> 00:08:41,697
[BOY A]
What position is he?

136
00:08:41,797 --> 00:08:42,965
[KEI]
He's a wing spiker.

137
00:08:43,065 --> 00:08:44,499
[BOY A]
Yeah?! Same here!

138
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,169
But they've got way too many
people on the roster though.

139
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:51,507
[BOY A]
It would suck to go to a school
like that and never get to play,
don't you think?

140
00:08:51,607 --> 00:08:55,144
[TADASHI]
(confused) Yeah but Tsukki's
brother DOES play.

141
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:59,214
[BOY A]
Wait... nuh‐uh! I just went to a
Karasuno game

142
00:08:59,314 --> 00:09:02,051
and I didn't see a guy named
Tsukishima on the roster.

143
00:09:02,151 --> 00:09:04,153
(KEI quiet shock)

144
00:09:04,253 --> 00:09:07,056
[KEI]
You don't know what you're
talking about...

145
00:09:07,156 --> 00:09:10,793
[KEI]
He's always telling me
about the games... You
don't know anything.

146
00:09:10,893 --> 00:09:12,161
(BOY A caught off guard)

147
00:09:12,261 --> 00:09:14,229
[BOY A]
Well, let's go to a game then
and see!

148
00:09:14,329 --> 00:09:16,632
[KEI]
Yeah, we'll see alright.

149
00:09:18,467 --> 00:09:21,470
(CROWD cheering)

150
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:27,009
(KEI panicked breathing)

151
00:09:32,414 --> 00:09:34,216
[TEAMMATES A]
One more! Nice receive!

152
00:09:34,316 --> 00:09:37,186
[TEAMMATES B]
Coming Left! Left!

153
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,489
(CROWD cheers)
(KEI snaps out of it)

154
00:09:43,526 --> 00:09:44,694
[ALL]
Yeah!

155
00:09:44,794 --> 00:09:47,362
[CLASSMATE A]
Wow! Check out the
ups on Number 10!

156
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,799
It's hard to believe
that guy's only 5'7"!

157
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:51,934
[CLASSMATE B]
Yeah, and he's only a
second‐year, too...

158
00:09:52,034 --> 00:09:55,805
[BOY A]
You see?! That guy on the
left side is a third‐year
named Kawata,

159
00:09:55,905 --> 00:09:59,308
and the ace player is a
second‐year that everybody
calls the Tiny Giant!

160
00:09:59,408 --> 00:10:00,976
It's been that way
for over a year!

161
00:10:01,076 --> 00:10:03,245
[TADASHI]
We get it already, okay!

162
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,516
[TADASHI]
Please just leave him alone.

163
00:10:06,616 --> 00:10:09,585
[BOY A]
Yeah, well... My big
brother's a third year

164
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:12,487
and he hasn't gotten to
play a single game either.

165
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:19,094
[KEI, internal]
What is this?

166
00:10:19,194 --> 00:10:23,432
[KEI]
It's like the feeling you get
when your favorite character in
a movie gets killed...

167
00:10:23,533 --> 00:10:28,170
[KRI]
but for some reason, this...
this is even worse.

168
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:30,139
[KEI]
I don't see my big
brother anywhere.

169
00:10:30,239 --> 00:10:31,907
[TEAMMATES]
One more! One more!

170
00:10:32,007 --> 00:10:33,643
[AKITERU]
Go for it, guys!!

171
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:48,123
[KEI]
That's so lame.

172
00:11:01,303 --> 00:11:03,939
[KEI]
It was nothing
but a stupid game.

173
00:11:04,039 --> 00:11:07,643
[KEI]
But it seemed like it was
everything my brother stood for.

174
00:11:08,978 --> 00:11:10,746
[KEI]
Enough for him to lie to me.

175
00:11:10,846 --> 00:11:13,583
[KEI]
Then, you're the ace!

176
00:11:13,683 --> 00:11:15,484
[AKITERU]
Kinda.

177
00:11:15,585 --> 00:11:17,853
[KEI]
Maybe he was trying
to make himself

178
00:11:17,953 --> 00:11:21,256
believe he could be the
ace if he tried hard enough.

179
00:11:23,192 --> 00:11:24,493
[KEI]
But even if he could...

180
00:11:24,594 --> 00:11:28,297
[KEI]
Was it really worth all that
desperation?

181
00:11:31,534 --> 00:11:36,839
[TADASHI]
Tzukkiiiii! (catches breath)

182
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:41,043
[KEI]
What?

183
00:11:41,143 --> 00:11:43,278
[TADASHI]
Tsukki, you've
always done everything

184
00:11:43,378 --> 00:11:45,648
in a cool, smart way.

185
00:11:46,616 --> 00:11:49,785
[TADASHI]
And... I was always jealous.

186
00:11:50,686 --> 00:11:51,587
[KEI]
Yeah, and?

187
00:11:51,687 --> 00:11:54,890
(TADASHI catches breath)
(determined)

188
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,693
[TADASHI]
But you've been acting really
lame lately okay!

189
00:11:57,793 --> 00:11:59,228
(KEI caught off guard)

190
00:11:59,328 --> 00:12:02,131
Hinata may very well become
the next Tiny Giant someday!

191
00:12:02,231 --> 00:12:05,267
[TADASHI]
And if that's true, then
you just need to buck up
and beat him!

192
00:12:05,367 --> 00:12:11,340
(KEI stunned)
[TADASHI] You have plenty of
skill! Use it to prove you're
a better player than he is!

193
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:14,577
[TADASHI]
You have the height, the brains,
and the reflexes,

194
00:12:14,677 --> 00:12:18,848
so why do you always set
limits for yourself?! Why?

195
00:12:18,948 --> 00:12:21,283
(TADASHI breathing heavily)

196
00:12:23,485 --> 00:12:26,388
[KEI]
Fine... let's say I
tried really hard

197
00:12:26,488 --> 00:12:30,092
and became the best player at
Karasuno. What comes after that?

198
00:12:30,192 --> 00:12:34,797
[KEI]
On the off chance that we
get to go to the national
championships, what comes next?

199
00:12:34,897 --> 00:12:37,466
[KEI]
There's always another
level to get to.

200
00:12:37,567 --> 00:12:40,770
No matter how good you get,
you can never be number one.

201
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:44,840
[KEI]
Which means you'll eventually
lose! Everyone knows that!

202
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:49,979
[KEI]
What's the point?! What makes
you guys keep pushing?! Why does
it even matter?

203
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,347
(TADASHI seething)

204
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:02,357
[TADASHI]
(seething) Don't be an idiot...

205
00:13:02,457 --> 00:13:05,795
It's our sense of pride! What
more do you need?! (panting)

206
00:13:09,732 --> 00:13:13,703
(TADASHI heavy
frustrated breathing)

207
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:22,778
[KEI]
How 'bout that?
The day finally came.

208
00:13:22,878 --> 00:13:24,680
(TADASHI confused)

209
00:13:27,482 --> 00:13:29,118
(KEI laughs to himself)

210
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:31,621
(TADASHI baffled)

211
00:13:31,721 --> 00:13:33,789
[KEI]
When the hell did you become
such a badass?

212
00:13:33,889 --> 00:13:36,559
(TADASHI confused)
[KEI] Really... You're cool now.

213
00:13:36,659 --> 00:13:39,829
[TADASHI]
(startled) T‐Tsukki? What's
wrong with you?

214
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:43,432
[KEI, internal]
At least, cooler than me
obsessing over it all...

215
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,968
[KEI]
But still...
I'm not convinced yet.

216
00:13:46,068 --> 00:13:47,837
[TADASHI]
Huh?

217
00:13:47,937 --> 00:13:49,038
[KEI]
I'll go ask them.

218
00:13:49,138 --> 00:13:51,306
[TADASHI]
(confused) Tsukki?

219
00:13:54,309 --> 00:13:56,679
[KOSHI] Uh hey, Daichi.
[DAICHI] Huh?

220
00:13:56,779 --> 00:13:58,714
[KOSHI]
Shouldn't we maybe go
talk to Tsukishima?

221
00:13:58,814 --> 00:14:02,484
[DAICHI]
If we force him to work on it,
it won't be personal training.

222
00:14:02,585 --> 00:14:04,787
[KOSHI]
I guess you do have
a point there.

223
00:14:06,021 --> 00:14:07,456
[DAICHI]
He's fine.

224
00:14:07,557 --> 00:14:10,926
I've known that ever since
we had that very first 3‐on‐3.

225
00:14:13,128 --> 00:14:15,731
[DAICHI]
Though, if Tsukishima starts
saying that he wants to quit...

226
00:14:15,831 --> 00:14:20,169
I'll beg him to stay...
and I expect you to help me.

227
00:14:20,269 --> 00:14:23,005
[DAICHI]
Look, I don't know what's going
on inside his head.

228
00:14:23,105 --> 00:14:25,875
But we're all still going down
the path of development...

229
00:14:25,975 --> 00:14:29,645
and none of us know the limits
of our own talents yet.

230
00:14:29,745 --> 00:14:32,982
[DAICHI]
We still have a lot of
potential. And that
includes him.

231
00:14:33,082 --> 00:14:36,151
[DAICHI]
And we all have to keep moving
forward to reach that potential.

232
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:38,921
[DAICHI]
Even if we don't understand why.

233
00:14:39,021 --> 00:14:40,523
[KOSHI]
That's true.

234
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:08,984
[HITOKA]
Say uh, is Tadashi okay? I just
saw him run away making a really
weird noise...

235
00:15:09,084 --> 00:15:10,152
[SHOYO]
Like what?

236
00:15:10,252 --> 00:15:13,022
[HITOKA]
"TZUKIIIII!" yeah.

237
00:15:13,122 --> 00:15:15,390
[SHOYO]
Oh... He's going to talk to
Tsukishima.

238
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,959
[HITOKA]
Did something happen?

239
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,329
[SHOYO]
Yeah. He seemed kinda worried
about him earlier.

240
00:15:20,429 --> 00:15:21,564
[HITOKA]
Oh really?

241
00:15:21,664 --> 00:15:22,998
You know how
Tsukishima never does

242
00:15:23,098 --> 00:15:24,767
anything that isn't cool, right?

243
00:15:24,867 --> 00:15:26,802
[SHOYO]
He always gets good grades,

244
00:15:26,902 --> 00:15:30,706
and he does everything with like
a "SHIIIIING" or a "FWOOOOSH",
you know?

245
00:15:30,806 --> 00:15:34,544
[HITOKA]
Umm... (internal)
I GUESS that makes sense...

246
00:15:34,644 --> 00:15:36,812
[SHOYO]
Anyway, I think
he'll be alright.

247
00:15:36,912 --> 00:15:39,114
[SHOYO]
Cause if he always does what's
coolest...

248
00:15:39,214 --> 00:15:42,151
Then obviously he'll do what it
takes to be good at volleyball!

249
00:15:42,251 --> 00:15:44,920
Cause volleyball's cool.

250
00:15:45,020 --> 00:15:46,255
[AKAASHI]
Oya?

251
00:15:46,355 --> 00:15:48,057
[BOKUTO]
Oya‐oya?

252
00:15:48,157 --> 00:15:49,725
[KUROO]
Oya‐oya‐oya?

253
00:15:49,825 --> 00:15:53,295
[KEI]
There's something I would like
to ask you... Do you mind?

254
00:15:53,395 --> 00:15:54,964
[BOKUTO & KUROO]
Oh no!

255
00:15:55,064 --> 00:15:58,868
[KEI]
(surprised) Okay then...
So uh here goes..

256
00:15:58,968 --> 00:16:02,437
[KEI]
You're on a team that's known
for being pretty good, right?

257
00:16:02,538 --> 00:16:04,406
(BOKUTO annoyed)
[KUROO] (annoyed) Well, yeah!

258
00:16:04,507 --> 00:16:07,877
[KEI]
Even if you could get to
nationals, it's difficult
to win it all, right?

259
00:16:07,977 --> 00:16:10,045
(KUROO annoyed)
[BOKUTO] It's not
impossible, jackass! (snarl)

260
00:16:10,145 --> 00:16:13,916
[AKAASHI]
Oh don't get all bent out
of shape... Let's just
hear him out okay.

261
00:16:14,016 --> 00:16:19,188
[KEI]
I'm asking a sincere question
here... What drives you guys
to work so hard?

262
00:16:19,288 --> 00:16:23,025
[KEI]
Volleyball's only an
extracurricular activity.

263
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,628
[KEI]
Is there any benefit to it other
than being able to put it

264
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:28,397
on your college application
or something like that?

265
00:16:28,497 --> 00:16:31,667
[BOKUTO]
Just an extracurricular?
(KEI startled)

266
00:16:31,767 --> 00:16:33,869
[BOKUTO]
I have a mind to punch
you in the face.

267
00:16:33,969 --> 00:16:37,039
[KUROO]
Dude. Maybe he's more
interested in his grades.

268
00:16:37,139 --> 00:16:39,509
[KUROO]
Not that you would
know anything about that.

269
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,977
[BOKUTO]
What did you say? I've been
getting better.

270
00:16:42,077 --> 00:16:43,979
I got a forty seven
on my Trig test. (whining)

271
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,415
[KUROO] Um. Congratulations?
[KEI] Should I say something,
or...?

272
00:16:46,516 --> 00:16:48,651
[BOKUTO] Damn right. I'm
like a super genius over here!
[AKAASHI] Nah, this'll take a
minute.

273
00:16:48,751 --> 00:16:50,986
[BOKUTO]
Hey! Tall dude with the glasses!

274
00:16:51,086 --> 00:16:52,287
[KEI]
It's Tsukishima.

275
00:16:52,387 --> 00:16:53,989
[BOKUTO]
Fine then, Tsuki‐blahala!

276
00:16:54,089 --> 00:16:56,391
Is this game... fun to you?

277
00:16:56,491 --> 00:16:59,862
[KEI]
(thinking) No... not really...

278
00:16:59,962 --> 00:17:03,899
[BOKUTO] You think maybe
that's because you suck at it?
(KEI stunned)

279
00:17:03,999 --> 00:17:09,605
[BOKUTO]
I'm a third‐year, and I've gone
to nationals, so I'm way better
than you... I'm like TWO of you!

280
00:17:09,705 --> 00:17:11,774
[KEI]
I already know that.

281
00:17:11,874 --> 00:17:16,345
[BOKUTO] But it wasn't until
only recently I felt like
volleyball was fun.
(KEI surprised)

282
00:17:16,445 --> 00:17:21,450
[BOKUTO]
It started when line shots
became a viable option for me
during games.

283
00:17:21,551 --> 00:17:25,988
[BOKUTO]
Blockers were starting to catch
onto my cross‐court shots and
making things difficult.

284
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:29,892
So I got ticked, and practiced
my line shots super hard.

285
00:17:29,992 --> 00:17:33,729
[BOKUTO]
Then... at the next tournament,
against the same blockers,

286
00:17:33,829 --> 00:17:40,035
[BOKUTO]
I shot right through and didn't
even let 'em touch the ball.
Made complete fools of 'em.

287
00:17:40,135 --> 00:17:47,777
[BOKUTO]
That one shot alone felt like
YEAH, "My time has come!", know
what I'm sayin'? (laughs)

288
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,948
(KEI caught off guard)

289
00:17:53,048 --> 00:17:56,786
[BOKUTO]
It's all about having a special,
badass personal moment like
that.

290
00:17:56,886 --> 00:18:01,791
[BOKUTO]
Who cares about the future?
As long as you have a chance
at winning the next game...

291
00:18:01,891 --> 00:18:03,793
Nothing else really
matters, does it?

292
00:18:03,893 --> 00:18:06,729
You get hooked on the rush
of beating the guy in front
of you...

293
00:18:06,829 --> 00:18:12,267
[BOKUTO]
and playing with a hundred and
twenty percent of your skill!
There's nothing better!

294
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:15,270
(KEI shocked)

295
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:18,407
[BOKUTO]
Well anyway, that's my story
and I'm sticking to it....

296
00:18:18,508 --> 00:18:21,644
[BOKUTO]
Even though yeah I know it might
not really apply to everybody.

297
00:18:21,744 --> 00:18:25,080
[BOKUTO]
So when you say volleyball's
only an extracurricular
activity,

298
00:18:25,180 --> 00:18:28,984
[BOKUTO]
I literally do not understand
what you mean. That said...

299
00:18:29,084 --> 00:18:32,421
I don't necessarily think
you're wrong either, pal.

300
00:18:32,522 --> 00:18:37,026
[BOKUTO]
However... if that moment ever
does come to you...

301
00:18:37,126 --> 00:18:41,030
that's the moment you'll fall
in love with volleyball.

302
00:18:41,130 --> 00:18:44,366
[BOKUTO]
Okay! I answered your question,
so you owe me a few blocks.

303
00:18:44,466 --> 00:18:48,037
[KEI] (startled) Wait, um...!
[KUROO] Yup, fair is fair after
all.

304
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:53,308
[HITOKA]
(surprised) Tadashi's back now.

305
00:18:53,408 --> 00:18:55,711
[SHOYO] Tadashi! Where is he?
[DAICHI] One more!
[CHIKARA] Let's go!

306
00:18:55,811 --> 00:18:59,715
[TADASHI]
It looks like he's practicing
with the two captains from
Nekoma and Fukurodani.

307
00:18:59,815 --> 00:19:01,917
[SHOYO]
What? are you serious!

308
00:19:02,017 --> 00:19:04,720
[SHOYO]
Maybe I should go over there...

309
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:08,691
[TADASHI]
Listen Hinata... Do you see
Tsukki as a rival?

310
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:11,193
[SHOYO]
Huh? Of course I do!

311
00:19:11,293 --> 00:19:15,330
[SHOYO]
We both play the same position,
and he has everything that I
don't!

312
00:19:15,430 --> 00:19:17,900
[SHOYO]
I've a lot to make up for.

313
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:21,837
[SHOYO]
Practice time! (pumped up yell)
Captain! I'm coming in!

314
00:19:21,937 --> 00:19:26,475
[DAICHI] Sure.
[HITOKA] Hey, if Hinata and
Tsukishima are rivals... then
it's the Sun versus the Moon!

315
00:19:26,576 --> 00:19:30,813
[TADASHI] Huh?
[HITOKA] Their names mean
"SUN shine" and "MOON island"!

316
00:19:30,913 --> 00:19:34,016
[TADASHI]
(surprised) Oh yeah...
You're right!

317
00:19:36,519 --> 00:19:37,653
[SHOYO]
Let's go!

318
00:19:37,753 --> 00:19:39,354
[TADASHI]
I just hope it works out...

319
00:19:39,454 --> 00:19:40,923
[HITOKA]
Oh?

320
00:19:48,363 --> 00:19:49,765
(practice game)

321
00:19:49,865 --> 00:19:51,300
[RYUNOSUKE]
Number 4!

322
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,768
(whistle)
(FUKURODANI cheers)

323
00:19:52,868 --> 00:19:55,971
[HITOKA]
Oh wow. No.4 is really
intense again today.

324
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:57,940
[KEISHIN] Hey Specs.
[TAKEDA] Huh...

325
00:19:58,040 --> 00:20:00,275
(long whistle)
(FUKURODANI celebrates)

326
00:20:00,375 --> 00:20:02,812
[KEISHIN]
The spikes from No.4
don't need to be stopped.

327
00:20:02,912 --> 00:20:04,580
Just make sure
they hit your hands!

328
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:05,681
[KURASUNO]
Right!

329
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:07,249
[HITOKA]
Oh, right...

330
00:20:07,349 --> 00:20:09,484
Even if they can't stop it,
if it hits their hands,

331
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,587
the momentum becomes
a bit weaker.

332
00:20:11,687 --> 00:20:15,658
[KIYOKO]
Yeah... Basically, there are
two different strategies when it
comes to blocking.

333
00:20:15,758 --> 00:20:21,030
[KIYOKO]
The soft‐block makes it easier
to receive the ball by having it
hit the blocker's hand first.

334
00:20:21,130 --> 00:20:24,834
[KIYOKO]
And the kill‐block completely
shuts the offense out.

335
00:20:24,934 --> 00:20:27,937
Kill block... you mean,
kill as in murder?

336
00:20:28,037 --> 00:20:29,071
Maybe...

337
00:20:29,171 --> 00:20:30,606
(HITOKA panicked)

338
00:20:30,706 --> 00:20:32,508
[KEI]
We don't have to stop him.

339
00:20:32,608 --> 00:20:34,376
(KURASUNO shocked)

340
00:20:37,446 --> 00:20:42,284
[KEISHIN]
That's right... if you guys can
slow him down, I won't ask for
anything else.

341
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:43,418
(TADASHI surprised)

342
00:20:43,519 --> 00:20:45,020
(long whistle)

343
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:48,824
(whistle)
(FUKURODANI cheers)

344
00:20:48,924 --> 00:20:51,661
[BOKUTO]
Nice receive! Send it over here!

345
00:20:51,761 --> 00:20:54,730
[DAICHI]
Left! Get number 4!

346
00:20:54,830 --> 00:20:56,832
[KUROO]
First, become conscious.

347
00:20:56,932 --> 00:21:01,336
Insert power all the way up to
your fingertips, so that they'll
never get blown back.

348
00:21:01,436 --> 00:21:05,908
[KUROO]
Oh yeah, and don't put your
hands straight up either...
Stretch 'em out...

349
00:21:06,008 --> 00:21:08,944
[KUROO]
So you can teach this owl
with frosted tips a lesson.

350
00:21:09,044 --> 00:21:11,080
[BOKUTO]
You wanna talk hair?! Huh?

351
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:17,620
[HITOKA, internal]
Let's see... a soft block
touches the ball to weaken
its momentum...

352
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:21,924
[HITOKA]
and to completely kill the
spike, it's a kill block.

353
00:21:29,364 --> 00:21:30,600
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's a lob!

354
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:31,767
[YU]
Ggh, dammit!

355
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:33,368
(whistle)
[TAKEDA] Aagh! No way,

356
00:21:33,468 --> 00:21:35,771
I totally thought he was about
to come in with a hard hit!

357
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:38,273
[TAKEDA]
Never expected that to
be some sorta feint.

358
00:21:38,373 --> 00:21:40,943
[TAKEDA]
That's a national‐level
ace for ya.

359
00:21:41,611 --> 00:21:43,112
[KEISHIN]
(amazed) Heh.

360
00:21:43,212 --> 00:21:46,481
[RYUNOSUKE] Do you... think...?
[DAICHI] Mm‐hm.

361
00:21:46,582 --> 00:21:48,651
[AKAASHI]
You're not supposed to run away
from it, you know?

362
00:21:48,751 --> 00:21:55,190
[BOKUTO]
(stunned) I didn't run away!
I dodged it! Gracefully!
Big difference!

363
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:59,128
[WASHIO] You're a liar.
[BOKUTO] Washio! Alright,
fine, I'm sorry!

364
00:21:59,228 --> 00:22:00,395
(KUROO snickers)

365
00:22:02,965 --> 00:22:03,999
(BOKUTO sneers)

366
00:22:04,099 --> 00:22:07,069
[NEKOMATA]
Hey... That's familiar.

367
00:22:09,438 --> 00:22:10,940
(TADASHI gasp)

368
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,808
[NEKOMATA]
Looks like that grumpy
little fledgling's

369
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:15,177
about to come out of his shell.

370
00:22:17,913 --> 00:22:20,349
(TADASHI relieved)

371
00:22:20,449 --> 00:22:24,854
[HITOKA]
(surprised) The Sun
versus the Moon...

372
00:23:56,011 --> 00:23:57,379
[BOKUTO]
Tsukki, jump me a few blocks!

373
00:23:57,479 --> 00:23:59,982
[KEI]
For the last time,
stop calling me that.

374
00:24:00,082 --> 00:24:01,651
[BOKUTO]
Okay... then how 'bout Skinny?

375
00:24:01,751 --> 00:24:04,053
[KEI] Ugh!
[BOKUTO] All right! You ready to
get started, A‐Dog?!

376
00:24:04,153 --> 00:24:05,454
[AKAASHI]
Is that supposed to be me?

377
00:24:05,555 --> 00:24:07,289
[BOKUTO]
Well who else is it
supposed to be?

378
00:24:07,389 --> 00:24:10,025
[AKAASHI]
Next Haikyu!!
"Versus Umbrella".
