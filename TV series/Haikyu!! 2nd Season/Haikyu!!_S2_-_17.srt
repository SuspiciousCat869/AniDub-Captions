1
00:00:03,427 --> 00:00:05,530
[Terushima]:
Aw, man!

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:06,964
If we had just won yesterday,

3
00:00:07,064 --> 00:00:09,066
we'd be playing
in a game right now!

4
00:00:09,166 --> 00:00:12,336
Well if Karasuno were to
win against Shiratorizawa...

5
00:00:12,436 --> 00:00:15,372
we'd at least come out
looking a little cooler.

6
00:00:15,472 --> 00:00:16,974
Nah.

7
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:19,910
We would've won if that stupid
Number 10 wasn't around.

8
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,380
Nah, it was the setter... That
guy caused a lot of trouble.

9
00:00:24,481 --> 00:00:26,150
Not the captain?

10
00:00:27,384 --> 00:00:31,756
Although Number 10 was pretty
fun to watch, wasn't he?

11
00:00:31,856 --> 00:00:33,558
The captain, huh?

12
00:00:33,658 --> 00:00:37,562
[Futamata]:
Well, maybe you're right...
He's their foundation

13
00:00:37,662 --> 00:00:40,130
and that can
sometimes be overlooked.

14
00:02:15,793 --> 00:02:16,894
[Tobio]:
Captain!

15
00:02:16,994 --> 00:02:18,362
Hey, Daichi!

16
00:02:18,462 --> 00:02:19,930
You okay?!

17
00:02:22,933 --> 00:02:23,934
[Guy 1]:
Oh, my God.

18
00:02:24,034 --> 00:02:24,902
[Guy 2]:
Something wrong?

19
00:02:25,002 --> 00:02:26,470
[Guy 3]:
He collapsed!

20
00:02:26,571 --> 00:02:28,072
Hm? What happened?

21
00:02:28,172 --> 00:02:30,340
That... was a collision.

22
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:33,143
[Toru]:
On the last hit, right after
he returned the ball...

23
00:02:33,243 --> 00:02:36,146
the captain collided with
that kid with the buzzcut.

24
00:02:36,246 --> 00:02:39,116
It looked like he hit
his face pretty hard.

25
00:02:39,216 --> 00:02:40,885
[Hajime]:
Whoa...

26
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:43,554
(groans)

27
00:02:44,488 --> 00:02:45,823
Alright, what hurts?

28
00:02:45,923 --> 00:02:48,726
M‐my face...

29
00:02:48,826 --> 00:02:51,529
Daichi, where
are you right now?

30
00:02:51,629 --> 00:02:54,064
Sendai City Gymnasium.

31
00:02:54,164 --> 00:02:56,066
And what team are
we playing against?

32
00:02:56,166 --> 00:03:00,370
W..Waku South, right?
I'm fine, I swear!

33
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,007
[Takeda]:
Look, you hit your
head pretty hard.

34
00:03:03,107 --> 00:03:05,543
so for now, go to
the medical office.

35
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,111
[Keishin]:
He's right.

36
00:03:07,211 --> 00:03:08,579
[Takeda]:
Please...

37
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:11,916
you need to confirm that
everything's alright, okay?

38
00:03:12,016 --> 00:03:13,383
Now, do it!

39
00:03:13,483 --> 00:03:15,520
That's the quickest way to
get you back into the game.

40
00:03:16,453 --> 00:03:17,655
Okay...

41
00:03:19,456 --> 00:03:20,324
You're bleeding

42
00:03:20,424 --> 00:03:22,159
What?

43
00:03:22,259 --> 00:03:23,794
You okay? You
feelin' nauseous?

44
00:03:23,894 --> 00:03:25,129
I hope this isn't
a concussion...

45
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:27,297
Ah, I feel f‐

46
00:03:30,535 --> 00:03:31,736
Too bad for him...

47
00:03:31,836 --> 00:03:34,972
I guess that might be it for
Mr. Captain for this game...

48
00:03:35,072 --> 00:03:36,907
But it's the coach's
decision, though.

49
00:03:37,007 --> 00:03:41,512
[Hajime]:
A hit like that could
give you a serious concussion.

50
00:03:41,612 --> 00:03:44,615
Hey Specs... you mind
if I leave this to you?

51
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,151
Um, Daichi...?

52
00:03:49,654 --> 00:03:50,755
I'm really sorry!

53
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,557
[Daichi]:
No, I'm sorry, Tanaka.

54
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:55,225
I saw you coming in
to cover the loose ball...

55
00:03:55,325 --> 00:03:58,095
but my body had a will of
its own and went for it.

56
00:03:58,195 --> 00:04:00,397
But, hey,
look at that...

57
00:04:00,497 --> 00:04:03,000
[Daichi]:
You got us a point back,
and now...

58
00:04:03,100 --> 00:04:06,036
we're on our way
to TAKING this.

59
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:10,675
Karasuno's Number 5...

60
00:04:10,775 --> 00:04:14,044
[Toru]:
He's pretty damn strong
mentally during a match...

61
00:04:14,144 --> 00:04:16,547
But that's only when
he finds himself cornered

62
00:04:16,647 --> 00:04:19,416
and has to make a play.

63
00:04:19,517 --> 00:04:22,186
I wonder how he will hold up
now that he's the reason

64
00:04:22,286 --> 00:04:24,822
the team's backbone has snapped?

65
00:04:24,922 --> 00:04:26,490
If they lose this match now...

66
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:29,459
this will be the last game
the Captain'll ever play.

67
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:32,763
I'm sorry, Asahi.
I'll be right back.

68
00:04:32,863 --> 00:04:34,999
But until I get here...

69
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:38,102
It's up to you.

70
00:04:38,202 --> 00:04:41,271
Don't you worry...
We'll be fine.

71
00:04:47,177 --> 00:04:52,416
[Hajime]:
His footing seems to be steady,
so he's probably okay, right?

72
00:04:52,517 --> 00:04:54,785
[Toru]:
Yeah, but the problem
is this match.

73
00:04:54,885 --> 00:04:57,922
Who can serve as a substitute
for their backbone?

74
00:04:58,022 --> 00:05:00,157
It's a big role to fill.

75
00:05:00,257 --> 00:05:02,126
Maybe they'll
use two setters?

76
00:05:02,226 --> 00:05:04,228
Yeah I dunno, unless
they regularly practice

77
00:05:04,328 --> 00:05:07,331
a double setup... or unless
they have a setter who happens

78
00:05:07,431 --> 00:05:10,200
to be better at attacking and
defending, than a wing spiker

79
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:13,170
would be... doing that
on the fly is too risky.

80
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,540
A wing spiker who can
replace their captain...

81
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:18,943
I'm not sure if they have a
player like that or not.

82
00:05:19,043 --> 00:05:21,746
We're counting on you!
Make it count!

83
00:05:21,846 --> 00:05:23,013
Huh?

84
00:05:23,113 --> 00:05:26,050
Ennoshita! You got this!

85
00:05:29,554 --> 00:05:32,790
Hm... He's one of the ones who
played in the practice match.

86
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,191
What kind of kid was he?

87
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:36,193
I don't remember
too much...

88
00:05:36,293 --> 00:05:40,064
[Hajime]:
But I think he was pretty steady
and accurate in his deliveries.

89
00:05:40,164 --> 00:05:42,266
[Toru]:
Karasuno doesn't
have a very big squad.

90
00:05:42,366 --> 00:05:45,503
Maybe they don't
have anyone else.

91
00:05:45,603 --> 00:05:48,873
Just like the
practice matches...

92
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:51,041
Just like in practice...

93
00:05:51,141 --> 00:05:54,211
Just like... practice...

94
00:05:55,646 --> 00:05:59,083
Anyway... go play to
your heart's content.

95
00:05:59,717 --> 00:06:01,318
It's not the same!

96
00:06:01,418 --> 00:06:03,654
Watching form the sidelines,
and being on the court

97
00:06:03,754 --> 00:06:07,625
are two completely
different things!

98
00:06:07,725 --> 00:06:11,028
Oh... so I guess it is
you after all, Ennoshita.

99
00:06:11,128 --> 00:06:12,229
Oh...!

100
00:06:12,329 --> 00:06:13,898
Hey, Ennoshita,

101
00:06:13,998 --> 00:06:16,634
you think I can send up some
quick attacks from the get‐go?

102
00:06:16,734 --> 00:06:18,168
Uh... Mhm.

103
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:21,471
Ennoshita! Their Number 1
blows balls outta the court,

104
00:06:21,572 --> 00:06:23,741
so keep that in mind!
You got that?!

105
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:25,009
Uh... yeah.

106
00:06:25,109 --> 00:06:27,111
Ennoshita, be cool,
it's all you!

107
00:06:27,211 --> 00:06:28,613
Make it happen,
you got this!

108
00:06:28,713 --> 00:06:30,915
It's understandable that
Ennoshita would be uneasy.

109
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:33,050
But I have to say,
if anyone was ever needed

110
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:35,686
to take Daichi's place,
it'd be him.

111
00:06:37,655 --> 00:06:41,526
Hey, Ennoshita... Sorry,
but... but we need you.

112
00:06:44,194 --> 00:06:46,363
Why are you "sorry"
about that?

113
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,932
Or are you just
feeling bad

114
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,600
that you knocked Daichi
out of the game.

115
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:51,301
[Chikara]:
Either one of you
could have been the one

116
00:06:51,401 --> 00:06:52,603
hurt by that impact.

117
00:06:52,703 --> 00:06:54,204
Just so happens
that it was Daichi.

118
00:06:54,304 --> 00:06:55,840
It could've
been you, instead.

119
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,708
You understand that, right?

120
00:06:57,808 --> 00:06:59,343
But you know,

121
00:06:59,443 --> 00:07:01,879
there's only one thing we're
all thinking about right now.

122
00:07:01,979 --> 00:07:04,348
Alright, go ahead, Asahi.

123
00:07:04,448 --> 00:07:07,585
We're just glad you didn't
get hurt too, Tanaka!

124
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:13,023
[Chikara]:
So c'mon! Buck up!
We need you to be focused!

125
00:07:13,123 --> 00:07:16,160
Our ability's already down with
Daichi being out of commission.

126
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:19,096
Can't have you all mopey
on top of that.

127
00:07:19,196 --> 00:07:21,331
Oh, I hope this all works out.

128
00:07:21,431 --> 00:07:24,802
I mean Ennoshita can be a little
bit on the timid side, y'know.

129
00:07:24,902 --> 00:07:25,703
He's a shy one.

130
00:07:25,803 --> 00:07:27,538
Oh hell no!

131
00:07:27,638 --> 00:07:30,374
[Saeko]:
Whenever they're at our place,
no matter how you look at it,

132
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:34,278
Ennoshita is totally the head
hancho of the second‐years.

133
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:38,182
Of the wing spikers,
Ennoshita is a good fit at this.

134
00:07:38,282 --> 00:07:40,250
He works pretty
well with others.

135
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,587
And has a knack of keeping
our crazy second‐years

136
00:07:42,687 --> 00:07:43,954
under control.

137
00:07:44,054 --> 00:07:45,790
And plus, lately, he's been
spreading his influence

138
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:49,026
over to those knucklehead
first‐years, too...

139
00:07:49,126 --> 00:07:50,728
Yeah, you're right...

140
00:07:52,296 --> 00:07:54,264
[Koshi]:
All yours, Ennoshita

141
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,002
[Nakashima]:
Nail it!

142
00:07:58,102 --> 00:07:59,303
[Naruko]:
Center!

143
00:08:00,671 --> 00:08:03,407
[Team WakuNan]:
(cheering)

144
00:08:05,242 --> 00:08:07,344
[Nakashima]:
Okay...

145
00:08:07,444 --> 00:08:10,247
Time to get those points back!

146
00:08:16,186 --> 00:08:17,588
Gah! Sorry!

147
00:08:17,688 --> 00:08:20,090
I'll extend my defensive
range a bit more!

148
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:21,992
Sorry if I'm
making things harder.

149
00:08:22,092 --> 00:08:27,464
[Kazuhito]:
Don't sweat it!
[Chikara]:
I can't match Daichi when

150
00:08:27,565 --> 00:08:29,600
as I am the one
standing here,

151
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:32,369
making excuses and running
from responsibility

152
00:08:32,469 --> 00:08:34,238
won't do us any good.

153
00:08:34,338 --> 00:08:36,874
Besides...

154
00:08:36,974 --> 00:08:38,509
Avoiding the conflict now,

155
00:08:38,609 --> 00:08:40,911
will only make it worse
in the future.

156
00:08:41,011 --> 00:08:42,647
That... I know.

157
00:08:45,182 --> 00:08:49,754
Let's GOOOOO!

158
00:08:49,854 --> 00:08:51,556
COME ON!

159
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:55,860
Not bad... substitute captain!

160
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:25,623
Until the Spring Nationals,
the third‐years will continue

161
00:09:25,723 --> 00:09:27,958
to lead the team.
But make sure you second‐years

162
00:09:28,058 --> 00:09:30,460
start thinking about
the next captain.

163
00:09:30,561 --> 00:09:32,496
It's important, you guys.

164
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:34,131
[Chikara]:
That's what Coach said.

165
00:09:34,231 --> 00:09:36,767
[Ryunosuke]:
The next captain, huh?

166
00:09:36,867 --> 00:09:39,637
Wouldn't it be all right
for Ennoshita to do it?

167
00:09:39,737 --> 00:09:41,238
Wh‐wh‐why me?!

168
00:09:41,338 --> 00:09:42,973
Just a hunch,
that's why!

169
00:09:43,073 --> 00:09:46,944
And you just ate that popsicle
in like two bites, didn't you?

170
00:09:47,044 --> 00:09:48,513
According to the rules,

171
00:09:48,613 --> 00:09:50,180
the libero can't become
the team captain, can he?

172
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,582
Yeah!

173
00:09:51,682 --> 00:09:53,784
I think Tanaka would
be fit for it, too...

174
00:09:53,884 --> 00:09:58,055
but looking at our line‐up
of all our first‐years...

175
00:09:58,155 --> 00:10:01,158
[Hisashi]:
We'll have to deal with a
couple of idiots...

176
00:10:01,258 --> 00:10:02,860
[Kazuhito]:
And a jerk.

177
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,930
Yeah... I do think we probably
need someone really calm

178
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:07,497
in the
captain spot...

179
00:10:07,598 --> 00:10:09,166
I do agree that Ennoshita
would make a good captain,

180
00:10:09,266 --> 00:10:11,468
but I'd like some more options.
In other words, you guys should

181
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,370
consider yourselves
as candidates!

182
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:14,672
No, no, no, no...

183
00:10:14,772 --> 00:10:16,440
That would be
a terrible idea.

184
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,375
[Ryunosuke]:
Whatever...
don't be wussies.

185
00:10:18,475 --> 00:10:21,912
Yeah, but... I ran away, so...

186
00:10:22,012 --> 00:10:26,617
[Chikara]:
I could... I could never be
the leader of the team.

187
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,260
[Chikara]:
Don't you remember
last summer...

188
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:38,863
Not yet! Dig that ball up!

189
00:10:41,365 --> 00:10:45,269
[Chikara]:
That next day, two of the
first‐years stopped showing up.

190
00:10:45,369 --> 00:10:48,038
And several days later,
I ditched practice

191
00:10:48,138 --> 00:10:51,609
for the first time since
starting in middle school.

192
00:10:51,709 --> 00:10:54,244
I just... went home.

193
00:10:54,344 --> 00:10:56,714
I faked an illness.

194
00:10:56,814 --> 00:11:00,851
I did feel... a little guilty
about abandoning the guys.

195
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,488
But at least I wasn't
getting yelled at in practice.

196
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:12,863
Whew, air conditioning!

197
00:11:12,963 --> 00:11:17,768
So I skipped the next day...
and the day after that, too.

198
00:11:17,868 --> 00:11:20,437
I didn't have to run
in the blazing heat.

199
00:11:20,538 --> 00:11:24,108
I didn't have anyone
screaming at me to "Do better."

200
00:12:23,568 --> 00:12:26,971
Okay. Here goes nothing...

201
00:12:33,578 --> 00:12:35,479
I'm... sorry for ditching!

202
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:37,615
Please let me join
practice again!

203
00:12:37,715 --> 00:12:39,850
Ennoshita, I'm glad
that you came bac‐

204
00:12:39,950 --> 00:12:43,087
Then don't show up in
your school uniform!

205
00:12:43,187 --> 00:12:44,421
Captain...

206
00:12:44,522 --> 00:12:47,625
I‐I'm sorry! I'll
change right away!

207
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,996
Relationships between
teammates are difficult...

208
00:12:52,096 --> 00:12:54,298
but only being
nice does you no good.

209
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,933
Yessir.

210
00:12:58,869 --> 00:13:03,841
Hey! If you're heading over,
yous hould probably change!

211
00:13:07,311 --> 00:13:09,246
[Kiroki]:
All right, let's get started!

212
00:13:09,346 --> 00:13:10,615
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

213
00:13:12,517 --> 00:13:14,084
[Kiroki]:
Let's get some laps!

214
00:13:14,184 --> 00:13:15,152
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

215
00:13:15,252 --> 00:13:16,521
Uh, yeah...

216
00:13:16,621 --> 00:13:18,055
[Kiroki]:
Karasuno, fight!

217
00:13:18,155 --> 00:13:20,357
Fight! Fight! Fight!
Fight! Fight! Fight!

218
00:13:20,457 --> 00:13:23,761
[Chikara]:
There were five first‐years that
boycotted practice back then.

219
00:13:23,861 --> 00:13:27,097
Of which, two resigned
from the volleyball team.

220
00:13:27,197 --> 00:13:30,535
I saw them later...
they seemed happy enough.

221
00:13:30,635 --> 00:13:32,069
Which is the better choice?

222
00:13:32,169 --> 00:13:34,204
Well that probably
depends on the person.

223
00:13:34,304 --> 00:13:37,107
For me, the time I spent
not playing volleyball

224
00:13:37,207 --> 00:13:39,777
was the most painful,
so I went back.

225
00:13:39,877 --> 00:13:42,947
But, all the doubt and
guilt from my leaving...

226
00:13:43,047 --> 00:13:45,616
that'll probably
never go away.

227
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:49,386
[Ryunosuke]:
That may just be why.

228
00:13:49,486 --> 00:13:52,056
It's all right because
you're back here with us, now!

229
00:13:52,156 --> 00:13:55,793
Oh, my popsicle was a winner...!
I'm gonna go redeem it!

230
00:13:55,893 --> 00:13:58,462
Okay, so not everyone on a
team's the same type of person,

231
00:13:58,563 --> 00:14:01,465
y'know? Y'see, I like to jump
right into things while other

232
00:14:01,566 --> 00:14:03,668
people out there are
pathetic little wimps!

233
00:14:03,768 --> 00:14:05,069
But then, you!

234
00:14:05,169 --> 00:14:07,705
You're the type of guy
who can work with everybody!

235
00:14:10,107 --> 00:14:13,410
All I know is that I came back
and I'm glad I did.

236
00:14:13,511 --> 00:14:15,145
Uh‐huh, of course
you are!

237
00:14:15,245 --> 00:14:16,346
Me, too!

238
00:14:17,381 --> 00:14:18,783
But either way,

239
00:14:18,883 --> 00:14:21,986
someone who quits isn't
fit to lead the team.

240
00:14:24,622 --> 00:14:28,793
Let's GOOOOO!

241
00:14:36,066 --> 00:14:39,203
[Yu]:
It's up!
[Ryunosuke]:
Ennoshita, nice one!

242
00:14:39,303 --> 00:14:40,571
Give it to me!

243
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,139
Asahi!

244
00:14:44,074 --> 00:14:45,876
(cheering)

245
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:48,278
Ennoshita! Good job
getting that up!

246
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,147
Y‐yeah!

247
00:14:50,247 --> 00:14:51,448
Even if did run away...

248
00:14:51,549 --> 00:14:55,553
even if I'm no match for Daichi,
I am going to fight!

249
00:14:55,653 --> 00:14:59,323
That's why I'm here!
That's why I came back!

250
00:15:00,224 --> 00:15:03,093
[Hisashi]:
Asahi, serve it up!

251
00:15:08,432 --> 00:15:09,600
Sorry about that.

252
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:12,269
Okay, okay,
next one!

253
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,239
[Shoyo]:
Serve it up!

254
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:25,683
We're not gonna let you keep
getting points, you know!

255
00:15:25,783 --> 00:15:28,285
We're sending this one down!

256
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:34,091
Waku South is staying
pretty poised.

257
00:15:34,191 --> 00:15:36,727
Shake it off, shake it off!
We can get 'em!

258
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:38,629
Uh... Tadashi...

259
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,164
Nice receive!

260
00:15:40,264 --> 00:15:41,465
[Hisashi]:
It looks like Kiyoko's
calling for you.

261
00:15:41,566 --> 00:15:42,833
[Tadashi]:
Oh!

262
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:46,937
Oooooh, yeah!

263
00:15:47,037 --> 00:15:49,173
[Koshi]:
Nice kill, Tanaka !

264
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:50,841
(whistle)

265
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,710
Huh?

266
00:15:56,346 --> 00:15:59,449
When Tsukki is up to serve,
you need to put in Tadashi

267
00:15:59,550 --> 00:16:00,785
as the pinch server.

268
00:16:00,885 --> 00:16:02,286
Under these conditions,
I want to avoid them

269
00:16:02,386 --> 00:16:04,154
flipping the game
and winning the set.

270
00:16:04,254 --> 00:16:07,825
We'll push it hard
and shake 'em off.

271
00:16:07,925 --> 00:16:10,427
[Referee]:
Okay. You can go.

272
00:16:10,528 --> 00:16:12,062
You're way too stiff.

273
00:16:12,162 --> 00:16:15,199
It's not like last time when
the opponent was in the lead.

274
00:16:15,299 --> 00:16:17,702
We're all just thinking
about how lucky we'll be

275
00:16:17,802 --> 00:16:19,369
if we can get this.

276
00:16:21,371 --> 00:16:22,507
Thanks, Tsukki!

277
00:16:22,607 --> 00:16:24,542
Was he... trying
to encourage you?

278
00:16:24,642 --> 00:16:27,978
Tsukishima sure has a crappy way
of saying nice things.

279
00:16:28,078 --> 00:16:29,880
[Chikara]:
Tadashi...
are you gonna puke?

280
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:32,683
Uhh... N‐no, I
think I'll be okay.

281
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,919
Good, glad to hear it.

282
00:16:35,019 --> 00:16:36,921
But I... think I might.

283
00:16:37,021 --> 00:16:39,757
A‐are you
all right, man?

284
00:16:39,857 --> 00:16:41,325
Yeah, that's an Ennoshita...

285
00:16:41,425 --> 00:16:43,861
He know good and well that
seeing someone more nervous

286
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,564
than you can help you
calm yourself down.

287
00:16:46,664 --> 00:16:48,566
Work your sorcery, my man.

288
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,935
I'm going to puke.

289
00:16:51,035 --> 00:16:55,172
It's fine, it's just fine...
Just like Tsukki said,

290
00:16:55,272 --> 00:16:58,075
we're in the lead...
I need to loosen up.

291
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,244
And I practiced
a lot for this.

292
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:01,746
(whistle)

293
00:17:08,953 --> 00:17:11,822
[Tadashi]:
Crap! The serve toss
was a bit low!

294
00:17:25,736 --> 00:17:27,304
[Ryunosuke]:
YEAAAH BUDDY!

295
00:17:27,404 --> 00:17:28,573
It made
it over!

296
00:17:28,673 --> 00:17:29,874
Yeah!

297
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:31,408
[Koshi]:
One more point!

298
00:17:31,509 --> 00:17:33,911
Oh, my God...
Whoaaaahh!

299
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:35,646
Do it again,
Tadashi!

300
00:17:35,746 --> 00:17:37,147
You got it!

301
00:17:37,247 --> 00:17:38,849
Uh... 'kay.

302
00:17:38,949 --> 00:17:40,918
You can do it,
Tadashi!

303
00:17:45,222 --> 00:17:48,959
Alright, so... I got lucky
that last one went in.

304
00:17:49,059 --> 00:17:50,327
But if I miss the next one,

305
00:17:50,427 --> 00:17:52,963
then it'll...
just cancel it out.

306
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:57,835
So... remember what
you did in practice.

307
00:17:57,935 --> 00:18:01,438
You can do it, land
the ball in the court!

308
00:18:01,539 --> 00:18:05,175
What's up? He's not going to
hit it while jumping this time?

309
00:18:06,777 --> 00:18:07,878
Got it!

310
00:18:09,113 --> 00:18:11,682
Is it some tactic to stop
using the jump float?

311
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:15,185
It's just a hunch, but that
Number 12 really screwed up

312
00:18:15,285 --> 00:18:17,254
the pinch serve back
in the Seijoh game.

313
00:18:17,354 --> 00:18:20,124
And since that last serve
was pretty sketchy...

314
00:18:20,224 --> 00:18:23,160
[Spectator 2]:
...maybe he chickened out?

315
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:28,265
Crap! The attack is coming!
Move it, Tadashi!

316
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:31,969
[Koshi]:
It's dropping! Go front,
the front, front, Tadashi!

317
00:18:32,069 --> 00:18:33,971
[Tadashi]:
Please legs... move...!

318
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:37,107
It's up!

319
00:18:37,207 --> 00:18:38,609
Nice one,
Ennoshita!

320
00:18:38,709 --> 00:18:40,144
Asahi!

321
00:18:44,381 --> 00:18:46,050
All right!

322
00:18:56,861 --> 00:18:58,128
All right!

323
00:18:58,228 --> 00:19:00,865
Asahi, that last
back‐row attack was nice!

324
00:19:00,965 --> 00:19:02,232
Heh... thanks.

325
00:19:02,332 --> 00:19:04,535
Um... Coach looks
a little upset...

326
00:19:06,904 --> 00:19:09,907
Oh no, he looks
really pissed.

327
00:19:10,007 --> 00:19:13,010
[Keishin]:
TA‐DA‐SHI...!

328
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:17,281
H‐he knows, Coach.

329
00:19:17,381 --> 00:19:21,385
Probably... he probably
knows better than any of us.

330
00:19:25,122 --> 00:19:28,125
What tha? Was there
a problem or something?

331
00:19:28,225 --> 00:19:29,794
Even without a jump serve,

332
00:19:29,894 --> 00:19:32,563
[Shimada]:
you can hit a ball
that doesn't spin.

333
00:19:32,663 --> 00:19:34,899
But when you jump up and make
contact from a higher point

334
00:19:34,999 --> 00:19:38,402
of impact, the ball can
travel with more force

335
00:19:38,503 --> 00:19:39,637
and is more effective.

336
00:19:39,737 --> 00:19:41,371
[Saeko]:
Okay, I see.

337
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:42,439
Don't get me wrong,

338
00:19:42,540 --> 00:19:44,441
taking a defensive
approach during a match,

339
00:19:44,542 --> 00:19:46,043
isn't always
a bad thing.

340
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,845
[Shimada]:
Now that said, in the end,

341
00:19:47,945 --> 00:19:50,480
it ended up being
a point for Karasuno.

342
00:19:50,581 --> 00:19:51,882
But...

343
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,251
for Tadashi and his level of
skill right now,

344
00:19:54,351 --> 00:19:57,822
the only weapon he really has,
is his serve.

345
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,525
So if he moves away from that...

346
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:05,863
If he abandons his strength...

347
00:20:05,963 --> 00:20:07,698
...he has nothing left.

348
00:20:15,472 --> 00:20:18,308
Don't be an idiot...!
It's OUR sense of pride!

349
00:20:18,408 --> 00:20:21,078
What more
do you need?!

350
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:24,181
[Tadashi]:
I'm not a very
confrontational guy...

351
00:20:24,281 --> 00:20:27,217
but I still went off
on Tsukki the other day.

352
00:20:30,454 --> 00:20:33,157
I don't even know
what I'm doing...

353
00:20:33,257 --> 00:20:35,593
Uh, hey Coach,
how's Daichi doin'?

354
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:39,429
He'll be fine, there aren't
any signs of a concussion.

355
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:40,765
However...

356
00:20:40,865 --> 00:20:44,368
The bleeding and pain in
his mouth are a bit severe.

357
00:20:44,468 --> 00:20:47,337
[Keishin]:
I'm gonna to let him
rest a bit, just in case.

358
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,909
Okay, thanks, Coach!

359
00:20:52,009 --> 00:20:54,579
Mm‐hm. Your job
is to win the game,

360
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:56,514
and prepare the next
stage for Daichi!

361
00:20:56,614 --> 00:20:58,816
You guys don't need to think
about anything other than that!

362
00:20:58,916 --> 00:21:00,050
You understand?

363
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,752
[Team Karasuno]:
Yessir!

364
00:21:03,387 --> 00:21:06,924
[Chikara]:
Hands in, guys.
All right! Let's go!

365
00:21:07,024 --> 00:21:09,126
Karasuno... fight!

366
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,695
[Team Karasuno]:
Fiiight!

367
00:21:10,795 --> 00:21:12,530
(whistle blows)

368
00:21:33,751 --> 00:21:37,121
Nice kill, Ushijima!

369
00:21:37,221 --> 00:21:44,161
Ushijima! Ushijima!
Ushijima! Ushijima!

370
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,531
Hey, Shiratorizawa
is five points

371
00:21:46,631 --> 00:21:48,766
from winning the match
before us.

372
00:21:48,866 --> 00:21:50,668
Time to head over.
Yeah.

373
00:21:50,768 --> 00:21:53,137
[Seijoh Guy]:
And the Karasuno ‐
Waku South match

374
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:55,840
seems like it will
drag on a bit.

375
00:21:55,940 --> 00:21:57,274
Oh, is that so?

376
00:21:57,374 --> 00:21:59,810
How is Karasuno doing
without their team captain?

377
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:02,479
His impressive receives that
have always stood out...

378
00:22:02,580 --> 00:22:05,215
Well they aren't the only
good ones that they have.

379
00:22:05,315 --> 00:22:07,885
But it can't last. If the
balls that they're used

380
00:22:07,985 --> 00:22:12,122
to going up stop doing so...
Their game will start to change.

381
00:22:12,222 --> 00:22:16,694
[Toru]:
Things like that start working
on you slowly and quietly.

382
00:22:18,162 --> 00:22:20,464
Maybe it's right about now...

383
00:22:21,331 --> 00:22:23,801
that they really
start feeling it

384
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:58,696
[Tobio]:
Ennoshita would be the type
to make a good team captain.

385
00:23:58,796 --> 00:24:00,497
[Shoyo]:
Then, who do you think
would be vice‐captain?

386
00:24:00,598 --> 00:24:02,767
I doubt Tanaka and Noya
are up for it.

387
00:24:02,867 --> 00:24:04,201
[Tobio]:
Why's that?

388
00:24:04,301 --> 00:24:05,402
[Shoyo]:
Because they have
mental problems.

389
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:06,671
[Tobio]:
You're one to talk!

390
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:09,507
