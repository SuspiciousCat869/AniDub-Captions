1
00:00:03,213 --> 00:00:05,283
[Daichi]:
It looks like
they chose to receive.

2
00:00:05,383 --> 00:00:06,817
We'll be serving first.

3
00:00:06,917 --> 00:00:08,386
Okay.

4
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:11,855
Time for the
deciding tournament.

5
00:00:11,955 --> 00:00:13,223
They seem nervous...

6
00:00:13,324 --> 00:00:15,225
A lot more nervous than
they usually are...

7
00:00:15,326 --> 00:00:17,961
[Takeda]:
especially the
third‐years.

8
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:20,531
[Shoyo]:
Aw, yeah!

9
00:00:20,631 --> 00:00:24,602
Tsukishima! Your new
glasses look so cool!

10
00:00:24,702 --> 00:00:27,771
Uh, you know you've been
saying that every day lately.

11
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,673
When YOU say something
of mine is cool,

12
00:00:29,773 --> 00:00:31,375
it makes me feel
a lot LESS cool.

13
00:00:31,475 --> 00:00:32,776
That's not cool!

14
00:00:33,911 --> 00:00:36,580
[Akiteru]:
Here ya go, Little Bro!

15
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,481
Huh?

16
00:00:37,581 --> 00:00:39,016
It's a pair of
sports glasses...

17
00:00:39,116 --> 00:00:41,652
I found some that are functional
AND pretty cool‐looking.

18
00:00:41,752 --> 00:00:43,321
When you're wear
these, face‐blocking

19
00:00:43,421 --> 00:00:44,855
won't be scary at all.

20
00:00:44,955 --> 00:00:47,625
Uh, yeah, it will.

21
00:00:47,725 --> 00:00:51,094
Ushiwaka's only human, you
know... You can beat him.

22
00:00:54,632 --> 00:00:57,167
What's up with the first‐years
looking more confident

23
00:00:57,268 --> 00:00:58,469
and reliable than us?

24
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,871
We don't have TIME
to be scared!

25
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:01,872
Yeah!

26
00:01:01,972 --> 00:01:03,574
(whistle blows)

27
00:01:03,674 --> 00:01:06,710
[Terushima]:
If we do end up going against
each other in the tournament.

28
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,713
I'm sure it's gonna
be a real good time.

29
00:01:11,315 --> 00:01:13,517
(whistle blows)

30
00:01:13,617 --> 00:01:16,053
[Team Karasuno/ Team Johzenji]:
Thank you for the game!

31
00:02:53,183 --> 00:02:55,853
Johzenji! Johzenji!

32
00:02:55,953 --> 00:02:58,188
This is it! The big
tournament starts today!

33
00:02:58,289 --> 00:03:01,559
These guys are one of the best
four from Inter‐High prelims...

34
00:03:01,659 --> 00:03:03,294
This should prove to be
a pretty interesting match.

35
00:03:03,394 --> 00:03:07,197
Alright, Man‐bun. You give
that first shot all you got!

36
00:03:07,298 --> 00:03:09,600
[Daichi]:
Karasuno, fight!

37
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,768
[Team Karasuno]:
Fight!

38
00:03:10,868 --> 00:03:12,235
Woo!

39
00:03:12,336 --> 00:03:13,771
[Ryunosuke]:
You got this, Asahi!

40
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:16,507
Get a nice,
solid receive!

41
00:03:22,513 --> 00:03:24,615
Man... that's intense!

42
00:03:25,516 --> 00:03:26,284
Nice cover!

43
00:03:26,384 --> 00:03:27,285
Terushima, last hit!

44
00:03:27,385 --> 00:03:28,786
Chance ball!

45
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,763
Woo... yes!

46
00:03:39,863 --> 00:03:41,299
Way to fight
you guys!

47
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:43,834
You gotta hit that strong all
the way from the end line?

48
00:03:43,934 --> 00:03:45,669
And he was hitting
it off‐balance, too!

49
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:49,540
Normally, you'd return
it with an underhand pass.

50
00:03:51,475 --> 00:03:52,943
[Futamata]:
Serve's up!

51
00:03:53,411 --> 00:03:54,578
Got it!

52
00:03:54,678 --> 00:03:56,213
[Ryunosuke]:
Left side!

53
00:04:09,427 --> 00:04:13,096
Let's go!

54
00:04:13,196 --> 00:04:16,900
This is no good... It's like
being up against a superstar

55
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,570
baseball team during
gym class, or something...

56
00:04:19,670 --> 00:04:20,904
Yeah, exactly...

57
00:04:21,004 --> 00:04:22,840
They don't really fit
any sort of pattern,

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,343
and you don't have any idea
what they're gonna do next.

59
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:30,213
[Koshi]:
Yeah... and the worst part is,
none of that is a coincidence.

60
00:04:31,582 --> 00:04:33,884
Uncertainties are
normal for Johzenji,

61
00:04:33,984 --> 00:04:36,954
and that in itself
is their weapon...

62
00:04:37,054 --> 00:04:39,257
[Terushima]:
Let's do it again!

63
00:04:41,892 --> 00:04:42,626
Come on!

64
00:04:42,726 --> 00:04:44,462
Hey!
Dork.
Sorry, guys!

65
00:04:44,562 --> 00:04:46,997
[Johzenji Cheer Leader]:
Shake it off, shake it off!

66
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:49,467
Come on! Grab the
ball and give it back!

67
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:50,734
[Numajiri]:
Yeah!

68
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:53,003
You guys get carried
away too easily.

69
00:04:53,103 --> 00:04:56,707
I hate to tell ya, but you're
the only third‐year left...

70
00:04:56,807 --> 00:04:58,742
Having to deal with
all those lunatic kids,

71
00:04:58,842 --> 00:05:01,178
you never
get a break.

72
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,847
[Daichi]:
Make it a good one, Tsukishima!

73
00:05:07,951 --> 00:05:12,956
It's a quick!
Well, in case you didn't know,
they can attack normally, too.

74
00:05:17,661 --> 00:05:19,663
Aw, sweet! A net‐ball!

75
00:05:19,763 --> 00:05:20,998
I'm on it!

76
00:05:21,098 --> 00:05:22,833
[Spectator 1]:
Nice reflexes!

77
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,002
[Spectator 2]:
But it might
not connect!

78
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:28,005
Nice Hinata!

79
00:05:28,105 --> 00:05:29,540
Whoa, he's flying!

80
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:31,375
[Hitoka]:
Look out!

81
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,678
[Spectator 3]:
He's like a dang spider!

82
00:05:39,983 --> 00:05:41,018
Back side!

83
00:05:41,985 --> 00:05:44,855
Holy crap!
They returned it!

84
00:05:44,955 --> 00:05:48,392
Guys who are super athletic
AND unpredictable.

85
00:05:48,492 --> 00:05:50,227
Sounds familiar,
doesn't it?

86
00:05:51,662 --> 00:05:53,264
BOO‐YAH!

87
00:05:53,364 --> 00:05:56,500
Well... that was actually
rather surprising, wasn't it?

88
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,903
But... It should be noted that
Karasuno's ridiculous attack

89
00:06:00,003 --> 00:06:01,405
hasn't been used yet.

90
00:06:01,505 --> 00:06:03,707
Take it to 'em, Kageyama!

91
00:06:07,545 --> 00:06:09,112
Aw, crap...

92
00:06:09,212 --> 00:06:12,149
No matter how pretty the receive
is, as long as the ball gets up,

93
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,418
they can do
something with it.

94
00:06:14,518 --> 00:06:18,121
[Anabara]:
All the boys know that, and they
have the skills to back it up.

95
00:06:19,390 --> 00:06:20,658
Dammit!

96
00:06:20,758 --> 00:06:22,125
[Terushima]:
One more shot!
Jiri, go direct!

97
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:25,429
Brutal... They're doing
nothing but defending.

98
00:06:26,864 --> 00:06:28,899
[Ryunosuke]:
Daichi, nice receive!

99
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,040
There it is!

100
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,942
No.10's
super‐quick attack!

101
00:06:39,042 --> 00:06:42,480
Hey, Kageyama! There's no way
we can lose to these guys!

102
00:06:42,580 --> 00:06:44,282
(intense high‐five)
So that was the quick‐attack
we heard about.

103
00:06:44,382 --> 00:06:46,016
[Shoyo]:
OUUUUCH!
[Tobio]:
Sorry, wuss.

104
00:06:46,116 --> 00:06:48,586
It's hard to predict
the opponent's movements,

105
00:06:48,686 --> 00:06:50,554
but the ball
isn't disappearing.

106
00:06:50,654 --> 00:06:51,855
Let's calm down
and go at 'em.

107
00:06:51,955 --> 00:06:53,090
[Shoyo]:
Right!

108
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,458
Nice, Captain...

109
00:06:57,428 --> 00:06:58,996
[Futamata]:
Number 10!

110
00:07:01,765 --> 00:07:05,536
Johzenji can be inaccurate in
all sorts of ways, can't they?

111
00:07:05,636 --> 00:07:07,004
I mean... look at them,

112
00:07:07,104 --> 00:07:08,706
their blockers are jumping
all over the place.

113
00:07:08,806 --> 00:07:10,608
And they're quick to
fall for decoys, too.

114
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,109
But they're nothing
if not persistant.

115
00:07:12,209 --> 00:07:13,577
And no matter how
you look at it,

116
00:07:13,677 --> 00:07:15,145
they're pretty tough
to deal with.

117
00:07:15,246 --> 00:07:17,348
Check this out, I have
a friend who plays on the

118
00:07:17,448 --> 00:07:18,949
Johzenji basketball team...

119
00:07:19,049 --> 00:07:20,284
Oh yeah?

120
00:07:20,384 --> 00:07:22,253
I heard that their
volleyball team plays nothing

121
00:07:22,353 --> 00:07:25,756
but 2‐on‐2 games for over
half of their practice time.

122
00:07:25,856 --> 00:07:27,558
[Obara]:
Really? Just 2‐on‐2?

123
00:07:27,658 --> 00:07:29,059
Well, that's dumb.

124
00:07:29,159 --> 00:07:30,928
Well, if that's all they're
used to, then they play

125
00:07:31,028 --> 00:07:33,297
without expecting anyone
to do anything for them.

126
00:07:33,397 --> 00:07:35,833
And so, every single one of
their players is looking to

127
00:07:35,933 --> 00:07:37,968
set up some attack
at all times.

128
00:07:39,603 --> 00:07:42,806
[Anabara]:
You idiots!
Talk to each other!

129
00:07:42,906 --> 00:07:44,408
And that's how things
like that happen.

130
00:07:44,508 --> 00:07:47,110
Each and every one of them
is really annoying...

131
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:48,779
Yeah, well, all the
other schools in town

132
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:50,581
think we're pretty annoying
too, y'know...

133
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:51,749
What?!

134
00:07:52,350 --> 00:07:53,451
Tanaka!

135
00:07:54,718 --> 00:07:56,387
[Terushima]:
Nice one, Jiri, yeah!

136
00:07:56,487 --> 00:07:58,989
[Kei]:
There are two attackers
in Johzenji's front line,

137
00:07:59,089 --> 00:08:00,591
excluding their setter.

138
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:03,994
A back row attack, maybe?

139
00:08:04,094 --> 00:08:06,930
That guy's the setter.
Who's gonna set it?

140
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,802
Someone from the back row?

141
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,304
Huh?

142
00:08:13,704 --> 00:08:15,072
WHAAA!

143
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:21,812
Let's go! Let's go!

144
00:08:21,912 --> 00:08:23,581
I gotta say...
they're tricky,

145
00:08:23,681 --> 00:08:26,317
but they're pretty entertaining
team to watch in action,

146
00:08:26,417 --> 00:08:27,084
aren't they?

147
00:08:27,184 --> 00:08:28,419
Can't argue with that.

148
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:30,087
But...

149
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,689
[Takeda]:
when it comes to such
a freewheeling attack,

150
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:33,791
we can keep up with them.

151
00:08:33,891 --> 00:08:37,227
So are you havin'
a good time yet?

152
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,930
They play hard...
and they're good...

153
00:08:40,030 --> 00:08:42,366
Old coach Ukai
used to say...

154
00:08:42,466 --> 00:08:45,436
"That to truly have fun, you
need to have strength as well."

155
00:08:45,536 --> 00:08:49,440
That one is not necessarily
complete without the other.

156
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,742
I didn't understand what
he meant... when he said

157
00:08:51,842 --> 00:08:53,076
fun was so
important...

158
00:08:53,176 --> 00:08:55,279
[Terushima]:
All right!

159
00:08:55,379 --> 00:08:59,483
[Tadashi]:
But now watching Johzenji,
I think I'm starting to see it.

160
00:09:00,418 --> 00:09:02,720
So having fun...
IS their strength.

161
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,256
Maybe they're just trying
to build each other up...

162
00:09:05,356 --> 00:09:07,958
but they sure do a lot
of clowning around.

163
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,727
Well, when they're
in the groove,

164
00:09:09,827 --> 00:09:11,362
they do play
good volleyball.

165
00:09:12,796 --> 00:09:14,097
[Futamata]:
Sorry, sorry!

166
00:09:14,197 --> 00:09:16,166
But this happens whenever
you compliment them...

167
00:09:18,469 --> 00:09:22,072
He's really tiny,
but he sure can jump!

168
00:09:26,777 --> 00:09:28,612
[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

169
00:09:28,712 --> 00:09:31,449
The setter looks like he's
kinda set in his ways...

170
00:09:31,549 --> 00:09:34,718
But he still manages to come up
with some really crazy attacks,

171
00:09:34,818 --> 00:09:35,853
doesn't he?

172
00:09:35,953 --> 00:09:37,488
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive!

173
00:09:37,588 --> 00:09:39,089
[Daichi]:
Asahi!

174
00:09:42,393 --> 00:09:44,562
Who's it gonna be?

175
00:09:44,662 --> 00:09:46,930
I see it! I don't think so!

176
00:09:52,169 --> 00:09:54,104
Nice block, Kageyama!

177
00:09:54,204 --> 00:09:57,908
Uh... that block
just now...

178
00:09:58,008 --> 00:10:00,344
[Takinoue]:
...he took it with his face.

179
00:10:20,464 --> 00:10:22,566
[Takeda]:
Time out!

180
00:10:22,666 --> 00:10:24,134
Gah! Kageyama,
are you okay?!

181
00:10:24,234 --> 00:10:25,903
He'll be fine,
little man.
Please, don't die!

182
00:10:26,003 --> 00:10:27,971
Until you stop bleeding,
you have to sit.

183
00:10:28,071 --> 00:10:30,007
Whatever, man!
I'm just fine!

184
00:10:30,107 --> 00:10:32,943
[Daichi]:
No, you're not...
What's wrong with you?!

185
00:10:33,043 --> 00:10:34,011
[Kiyoko]:
How are your eyes?

186
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:35,246
[Tobio]:
They're fine.

187
00:10:35,346 --> 00:10:37,648
Did their enthusiasm
lure him in?

188
00:10:37,748 --> 00:10:39,517
They can be
a bit infectious...

189
00:10:39,617 --> 00:10:42,386
Well, this is a good opportunity
to cool your head off.

190
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:44,355
[Keishin]:
You not getin' back out
there out until

191
00:10:44,455 --> 00:10:46,857
you stop bleeding anyway,
so go get yourself checked out.

192
00:10:46,957 --> 00:10:48,659
[Takeda]:
I‐it's just in case!

193
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:50,027
Come on, let's go.

194
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:51,629
[Shoyo]:
Hey, Kageyama!

195
00:10:51,729 --> 00:10:53,331
Don't worry!
I got this!

196
00:10:53,431 --> 00:10:57,067
How about... You just leave it
up to your upperclassman.

197
00:10:58,736 --> 00:11:02,240
[Koshi]:
Tsukishima, make it
a nice serve!

198
00:11:06,109 --> 00:11:08,446
Wait, what are they doing?

199
00:11:08,546 --> 00:11:10,614
[Obara]:
Why are they
taking out Number 10?

200
00:11:10,714 --> 00:11:11,882
I mean, he doesn't seem like

201
00:11:11,982 --> 00:11:13,751
he's doing all
that bad or anything.

202
00:11:13,851 --> 00:11:15,986
[Futakuchi]:
Maybe they're going
to use this opportunity

203
00:11:16,086 --> 00:11:17,688
to try something else out.

204
00:11:17,788 --> 00:11:20,858
Besides... the other guys
seem to be a little better

205
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:22,660
at basic playing skills.

206
00:11:24,161 --> 00:11:27,665
Oh, come on, man...
I'm telling the truth, right?
So tell us,

207
00:11:27,765 --> 00:11:29,500
what do you think about your
little friend there, Aone?

208
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,802
[Obara]:
You seem to know
his game pretty well.

209
00:11:31,902 --> 00:11:33,937
Is this all he's got or what?

210
00:11:34,037 --> 00:11:36,640
[Aone]:
It may be like that for now.

211
00:11:36,740 --> 00:11:38,576
Oh, my God... he...

212
00:11:38,676 --> 00:11:40,143
...Spoke!

213
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:43,581
And Player 10 standing over
there... understands that.

214
00:11:44,047 --> 00:11:45,383
Hey, Ginger.

215
00:11:48,452 --> 00:11:50,020
You should
watch Kazuhito...

216
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,889
He's been practicing
combination plays

217
00:11:51,989 --> 00:11:54,224
with Sugawara setting
for him, yeah?

218
00:11:54,325 --> 00:11:57,561
So, I want you to just watch and
learn from your upperclassmen.

219
00:11:57,661 --> 00:11:58,996
Yessir.

220
00:11:59,096 --> 00:12:00,731
We're gonna cut 'em
short with one serve!

221
00:12:00,831 --> 00:12:02,633
Kazuhito,
get a grip!

222
00:12:02,733 --> 00:12:05,536
Could you please just calm down.
We know you wanna be in there.

223
00:12:05,636 --> 00:12:09,407
I want to be in the game,
and practice, too.

224
00:12:09,507 --> 00:12:12,510
There is still...
a lot to do!

225
00:12:15,012 --> 00:12:15,646
[Tadashi]:
Nice kill!

226
00:12:15,746 --> 00:12:16,747
Nice kill!

227
00:12:16,847 --> 00:12:17,815
Whew...

228
00:12:17,915 --> 00:12:19,550
Keep at it,
keep at it!

229
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,885
Okay!

230
00:12:21,985 --> 00:12:24,187
[Numajiri]:
Terushima,
serve it up!

231
00:12:29,059 --> 00:12:32,229
Woo‐hoo‐hoo! That's what
I'm talkin' about baby!

232
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:34,932
That look as though he's just
scored three points in one shot

233
00:12:35,032 --> 00:12:36,567
is really
pissin' me off!

234
00:12:36,667 --> 00:12:39,102
Yeah, well, uh...
look who's talking, Tanaka.

235
00:12:39,202 --> 00:12:41,138
What'd you
just say to me?!

236
00:12:42,139 --> 00:12:43,941
Don't get distracted
by their excitement.

237
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,577
Just go after them,
and TAKE the set!

238
00:12:46,677 --> 00:12:48,312
Shake it off,
shake it off!

239
00:12:48,412 --> 00:12:51,282
C'mon guys,
let's do this!

240
00:12:51,382 --> 00:12:53,251
[Tadashi]:
Oh, look at that...

241
00:12:53,351 --> 00:12:55,486
Kageyama is going
to be just fine!

242
00:12:55,586 --> 00:12:58,922
Yeah, it looks like it.
Nicely done.

243
00:12:59,022 --> 00:13:01,692
[Takinoue]:
But I guess they're not
gonna swap guys in yet.

244
00:13:01,792 --> 00:13:02,693
[Daichi]:
Nishinoya!

245
00:13:02,793 --> 00:13:03,761
[Yu]:
Got it!

246
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:05,429
[Asahi]:
Nice receive!

247
00:13:05,529 --> 00:13:08,599
So I seem to recall you saying
you've "got this"...

248
00:13:08,699 --> 00:13:10,033
Oh, shut your face!

249
00:13:10,133 --> 00:13:14,137
I'll be able to do so
real soon! You'll see!

250
00:13:17,475 --> 00:13:18,509
Brutal!

251
00:13:18,609 --> 00:13:20,244
Nice kill!

252
00:13:21,178 --> 00:13:22,713
We won't lose...!

253
00:13:25,048 --> 00:13:26,650
Ah, Chance ball!

254
00:13:27,651 --> 00:13:29,820
Got it!

255
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,123
[Team Karasuno]:
Synchronized attack,
Sugawara version!

256
00:13:36,159 --> 00:13:37,528
All right!

257
00:13:37,628 --> 00:13:39,797
[Kiyoko]:
This is it.
Set point.

258
00:13:39,897 --> 00:13:42,733
That thing where everyone
starts moving all at once...

259
00:13:42,833 --> 00:13:44,735
That looks
pretty awesome!

260
00:13:44,835 --> 00:13:46,537
Hey... listen up...

261
00:13:48,205 --> 00:13:50,841
Oh my God...
please you guys...!

262
00:13:50,941 --> 00:13:53,611
[Daichi]:
C'mon, Kazuhito! One more!

263
00:13:56,547 --> 00:13:59,717
Johzenji is also doing
a synchronized attack?!

264
00:14:00,518 --> 00:14:02,320
[Terushima]:
Oh, NOW it's on!

265
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:06,156
HUAAAAAAA... aaaaah...

266
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:14,698
All right, guys! That's what
I'm talkin' about! Good stuff!

267
00:14:14,798 --> 00:14:16,934
Yeah, we used to do
that ALL the time.

268
00:14:17,034 --> 00:14:20,237
That synchronized attack
from Johzenji just now...

269
00:14:20,338 --> 00:14:22,172
They're playin' us
at our own game.

270
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:23,841
Copyin' what
they saw us do.

271
00:14:23,941 --> 00:14:28,512
What? When they're behind? And
even trying it out on set point?

272
00:14:28,612 --> 00:14:31,214
[Keishin]:
Could be, because we're still
in the first set.

273
00:14:31,315 --> 00:14:34,552
It's absolutely frightening
how reckless they are.

274
00:14:35,553 --> 00:14:37,321
Check out
their banner...

275
00:14:37,421 --> 00:14:39,490
"Simple and Strong" doesn't
seem to mesh very well

276
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:41,459
[Takeda]:
with how the team
acts, does it?

277
00:14:41,559 --> 00:14:44,628
They're pretty wild
and sporatic.

278
00:14:44,728 --> 00:14:46,430
They should probably go
with something like:

279
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:48,399
"Crazy and a Little Confused."

280
00:14:48,499 --> 00:14:52,102
I'm not so sure... up until
very recently, Johzenji has been

281
00:14:52,202 --> 00:14:54,805
known as a pretty
simple yet strong team.

282
00:14:54,905 --> 00:14:56,039
At least they were...

283
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,441
You guys should
really think about

284
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,343
when to try
something like that.

285
00:14:59,443 --> 00:15:01,612
But I really thought we
could pull it off, coach.

286
00:15:01,712 --> 00:15:03,714
They took a set
from you guys!

287
00:15:03,814 --> 00:15:06,584
Just like all of you,
they can cause a lot of trouble

288
00:15:06,684 --> 00:15:08,619
if you let 'em get going!

289
00:15:08,719 --> 00:15:11,489
That Number 10 sure
jumps around a lot.

290
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:14,392
That is what
their banner says.

291
00:15:14,492 --> 00:15:16,226
Yeah, and then
there's ours...

292
00:15:16,327 --> 00:15:18,262
[Bobata]:
Our banner seems so cheesy.

293
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:21,064
We should probably
get ourselves a new one, huh?

294
00:15:21,164 --> 00:15:22,600
Come on it's not that bad.

295
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,735
"Simple and Strong"
is timeless, right?

296
00:15:24,835 --> 00:15:26,937
[Terushima]:
That's more a matter
of taste, but, uh...

297
00:15:27,037 --> 00:15:28,939
it's not a good match
for our team.

298
00:15:29,039 --> 00:15:33,010
At least not for our generation.
Or rather... the generation

299
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,712
that's coming after us.

300
00:15:34,812 --> 00:15:36,447
I'll say...

301
00:15:40,251 --> 00:15:43,621
[Anabara]:
My name is Anabara, and I'll be
your coach starting this year.

302
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:46,490
I will be recreating the team
from the foundation up.

303
00:15:46,590 --> 00:15:49,893
First off, make 2‐on‐2
games actually happen.

304
00:15:49,993 --> 00:15:52,530
[Student 1]:
I heard they have five
second‐years on their squad.

305
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:55,132
[Student 2]:
Seriously? Making it
to the semifinals

306
00:15:55,232 --> 00:15:57,601
with a team
like that is amazing.

307
00:15:57,701 --> 00:15:58,969
[Okudake]:
Hey, man.

308
00:15:59,069 --> 00:15:59,903
Hmm?

309
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:01,339
They'll be a time...

310
00:16:01,439 --> 00:16:03,474
when things aren't all
fun and games anymore.

311
00:16:03,574 --> 00:16:06,477
What're you going to do
with yourself, then?

312
00:16:07,778 --> 00:16:10,881
I dunno. I'll probably
have fun anyway.

313
00:16:12,516 --> 00:16:14,985
[Terushima]:
Alright guys are you
ready to do this?!

314
00:16:15,085 --> 00:16:17,555
[Team Johzenji]:
(cheering)

315
00:16:19,222 --> 00:16:20,758
Aw man...

316
00:16:20,858 --> 00:16:23,126
[Futamata]:
I'm guessing we're gonna
see that weird combo

317
00:16:23,226 --> 00:16:24,528
of theirs again.

318
00:16:24,628 --> 00:16:26,797
Hinata, Kageyama,
make sure to calm down!

319
00:16:26,897 --> 00:16:28,266
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
(psyched yelling)

320
00:16:28,366 --> 00:16:30,133
Dear God,
shut up!

321
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:32,703
[Terushima]:
I see you're back!
You're like a spider monkey!

322
00:16:32,803 --> 00:16:36,540
It's boring out here without
you y'know. And your huge jumps!

323
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,508
"Boring"?

324
00:16:37,608 --> 00:16:39,109
Yeah boring like
your captain!

325
00:16:39,209 --> 00:16:41,545
He's good and all,
but he's kinda dull!

326
00:16:41,645 --> 00:16:43,981
Huh? I have no idea
what you mean...

327
00:16:44,081 --> 00:16:48,118
Well in any case... next set,
we're playing to win!

328
00:16:48,218 --> 00:16:51,522
Y'know, one‐on‐one, I can't
really win against you, Dye‐job.

329
00:16:51,622 --> 00:16:53,957
Hey! Don't give me
a nickname, Coppertop!

330
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,760
But with the rest of
my team, you can't win!

331
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:04,268
[Futamata]:
All right, send it up!

332
00:17:04,368 --> 00:17:06,370
[Daichi]:
Nishinoya!
All right!

333
00:17:11,775 --> 00:17:13,711
I TOLD YOU GUYS!

334
00:17:18,081 --> 00:17:19,483
Amazing reflexes!

335
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:22,253
No... more like he knew
that it was coming.

336
00:17:22,353 --> 00:17:24,187
Daichi, nice
ass‐wiping!

337
00:17:24,288 --> 00:17:26,524
You REALLY need a
new way to say that...

338
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:28,426
Here!

339
00:17:29,593 --> 00:17:32,062
Do these guys
even HAVE a plan?!

340
00:17:38,336 --> 00:17:39,470
All right!

341
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:41,739
This time, we
finally nailed it!

342
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:43,841
Thanks!
Sorry about that!
Nice cover!

343
00:17:43,941 --> 00:17:46,143
No matter how much we
told you to calm down,

344
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:49,713
I had a feeling you guys would
still botch the first shot.

345
00:17:49,813 --> 00:17:51,615
[Daichi]:
You're too wound up!

346
00:17:52,983 --> 00:17:56,354
I'm no good at super‐flashy
moves, but at the very least,

347
00:17:56,454 --> 00:17:58,722
I can create a foundation.

348
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:07,230
Anyway, go play to
your heart's content.

349
00:18:07,331 --> 00:18:09,199
[Shoyo/Tobio]:
Thank you!

350
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:12,403
[Keishin]:
Even if these guys ARE a bit
wild and undisciplined...

351
00:18:12,503 --> 00:18:15,005
they aren't any better
or worse than we are.

352
00:18:15,105 --> 00:18:16,707
Although...

353
00:18:16,807 --> 00:18:19,543
[Keishin]:
We have somethin'
else goin' for us.

354
00:18:25,516 --> 00:18:27,285
The lead just keeps
getting bigger.

355
00:18:27,385 --> 00:18:29,420
[Terushima]:
Come on guys,
get into it!

356
00:18:34,992 --> 00:18:36,494
[Bobata]:
It's up! Last hit!

357
00:18:36,594 --> 00:18:38,161
Get back!

358
00:18:40,898 --> 00:18:41,532
Yeah!

359
00:18:41,632 --> 00:18:43,166
Tanaka, nice one!

360
00:18:46,203 --> 00:18:47,338
All right!

361
00:18:47,438 --> 00:18:48,339
A counterattack!

362
00:18:48,439 --> 00:18:50,007
Yeah!

363
00:18:50,107 --> 00:18:53,311
Dammit! There's no way we can
keep up with that Number 10!

364
00:18:53,411 --> 00:18:55,178
Hinata, nice kill!

365
00:18:55,279 --> 00:18:56,614
[Shoyo]:
Anytime!

366
00:19:00,584 --> 00:19:03,086
[Daichi]:
Shake it off, shake it off!
[Shoyo]:
Sorry!

367
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:05,122
This set's all ours!

368
00:19:07,658 --> 00:19:09,493
[Yu]:
It's out!

369
00:19:11,228 --> 00:19:13,564
[Futamata]:
Shake it off, shake it off!

370
00:19:13,664 --> 00:19:15,098
[Ryunosuke]:
Get some, Daichi!

371
00:19:17,935 --> 00:19:18,702
Got it!

372
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:20,538
Sorry!

373
00:19:20,638 --> 00:19:22,340
I got this!

374
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:23,674
He's just going
to send it over!

375
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,743
Oh, yeah,
take it to 'em!

376
00:19:28,446 --> 00:19:30,948
Uh, sorry...

377
00:19:31,048 --> 00:19:33,150
Look at that!
They're taking a time out!

378
00:19:33,251 --> 00:19:34,752
It's good to be
on the offensive,

379
00:19:34,852 --> 00:19:36,587
but Johzenji is
rushing themselves.

380
00:19:36,687 --> 00:19:39,590
Come on guys we're so close!

381
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,791
We got this,
we can do it!

382
00:19:40,891 --> 00:19:42,793
We can make
something of this!

383
00:19:42,893 --> 00:19:45,663
Then, what do we do with that
quick attack from Number 10?

384
00:19:45,763 --> 00:19:46,564
What should we do?

385
00:19:46,664 --> 00:19:48,366
What should we do?

386
00:19:48,466 --> 00:19:50,268
Uh... what
SHOULD we do?

387
00:19:50,368 --> 00:19:53,604
[Terushima]:
Don't think too hard!
Just rush in and attack!

388
00:19:53,704 --> 00:19:56,374
Just go for it! Do it!

389
00:19:56,474 --> 00:20:00,110
[Okudake]:
So, Misaki, what are you
going to do from now on?

390
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,380
[Misaki]:
I still haven't
found a successor

391
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,748
to take my place on
the sidelines yet...

392
00:20:04,848 --> 00:20:07,385
so I'll stick around
until Nationals.

393
00:20:07,485 --> 00:20:09,553
I can't say I'm
disappointed about that.

394
00:20:09,653 --> 00:20:11,221
Y'know, those guys are
actually really good

395
00:20:11,322 --> 00:20:12,623
whenever they're
doing well,

396
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:15,192
but when they break down,
it goes downhill fast.

397
00:20:15,293 --> 00:20:16,760
You gotta whip 'em
into shape.

398
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:19,863
I don't think they'd listen
to anything I have to say...

399
00:20:19,963 --> 00:20:22,232
Aw, come on, now.
That's not true.

400
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:27,371
[Bobata]:
You're right! Let's just do it!
Just rush in!

401
00:20:27,471 --> 00:20:28,539
[Futamata]:
Totally!

402
00:20:28,639 --> 00:20:30,241
[Numajiri]:
Just rush in, guys!

403
00:20:32,042 --> 00:20:34,912
[Misaki]:
What is the big, stupid hurry?!

404
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:41,151
You guys are always trying
to make it happen

405
00:20:41,252 --> 00:20:42,953
with just enthusiasm.

406
00:20:43,053 --> 00:20:47,258
But listen. There are times that
won't always be fun and games.

407
00:20:48,526 --> 00:20:50,694
What're you gonna
do with yourself then?

408
00:20:50,794 --> 00:20:53,897
I dunno, I'll probably
have fun anyway!

409
00:20:53,997 --> 00:20:57,034
You seriously having fun
when you're getting crushed?

410
00:20:57,134 --> 00:20:58,769
I don't know what kind
of player that is,

411
00:20:58,869 --> 00:21:00,938
but he's certainly
not going to win.

412
00:21:02,373 --> 00:21:05,108
Um... Misaki? Is
something wrong?

413
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,177
I'm fine but
they're not.

414
00:21:07,278 --> 00:21:09,447
[Misaki]:
I don't think these goofballs
can face their weaknesses

415
00:21:09,547 --> 00:21:12,783
unless somebody just comes out
and tells it to them straight.

416
00:21:12,883 --> 00:21:14,352
Which brings me to this:

417
00:21:14,452 --> 00:21:16,620
Uh, yeah?

418
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,988
Just so you know...

419
00:21:18,088 --> 00:21:21,124
Okudake asked me to smack
their asses into gear.

420
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:22,159
"Asses"?

421
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,327
Wow, how lewd...

422
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:25,296
She just said "asses"!

423
00:21:25,896 --> 00:21:27,298
Kay...

424
00:21:27,398 --> 00:21:29,600
it's true that the current
situation isn't much fun.

425
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,069
[Terushima]:
And well, I hate to say it,
but those guys are playing

426
00:21:32,169 --> 00:21:35,473
a lot more freely
than we are.

427
00:21:35,573 --> 00:21:37,808
You know what Okudake
liked to say...

428
00:21:37,908 --> 00:21:41,078
"To play, you first
need a playground."

429
00:21:41,178 --> 00:21:43,914
Bear with the times
that are "not fun"...

430
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:47,351
and then you can keep playing
till the very end.

431
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:53,123
Did I just hear them all
over there talking about asses?

432
00:21:53,223 --> 00:21:54,458
What's the matter?

433
00:21:54,558 --> 00:21:55,893
[Ryunosuke]:
Kiyoko...

434
00:21:57,361 --> 00:21:58,796
I don't really get it...

435
00:21:58,896 --> 00:22:01,098
but I think it's a good idea
for us to be scolded, too.

436
00:22:01,198 --> 00:22:03,267
We are prepared to
take your punishment.

437
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,201
No.

438
00:22:04,302 --> 00:22:05,303
Here...

439
00:22:05,403 --> 00:22:07,104
I'm not smacking
your butts.

440
00:22:07,204 --> 00:22:11,074
Kiyoko sounds so sexy
when she talks like that!

441
00:22:15,946 --> 00:22:19,082
We're halfway through
the second set...

442
00:22:19,182 --> 00:22:22,653
[Keishin]:
This is where the fun
REALLY begins...

443
00:23:56,213 --> 00:23:59,450
[Daichi]:
Those guys from Johzenji sure
play some magic volleyball.

444
00:23:59,550 --> 00:24:01,051
[Shoyo]:
We gotta keep up!

445
00:24:01,151 --> 00:24:03,554
[Yu]:
Rolling... Head‐butt!

446
00:24:03,654 --> 00:24:05,423
[Shoyo]:
Noya, that's awesome!

447
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,924
[Daichi]:
That's NOT volleyball...

448
00:24:07,024 --> 00:24:09,993
[Asahi]:
Next Haikyu!! "To the Next"
