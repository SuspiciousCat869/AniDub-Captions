1
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:08,117
(BOKUTO heavy breathing)

2
00:00:08,752 --> 00:00:10,186
[BOKUTO]
Akaashi...

3
00:00:10,286 --> 00:00:13,723
[BOKUTO] Don't send it
to me anymore today!
(ALL sigh)

4
00:00:13,823 --> 00:00:15,358
[AKAASHI] All right.
[BOKUTO] Huh?

5
00:00:15,458 --> 00:00:17,426
[AKAASHI]
But while I'm not
sending any sets to you,

6
00:00:17,527 --> 00:00:19,395
please try and chill out.

7
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:26,670
[DAICHI]
This is our chance, guys. It
looks like their ace is off his
game! Let's keep after 'em!

8
00:00:26,770 --> 00:00:28,204
[KURASUNO]
Yeah!

9
00:02:08,304 --> 00:02:09,906
[SARUKUI] All right!
(whistle)

10
00:02:10,006 --> 00:02:11,508
[AKAASHI]
Well done, man. Nice.

11
00:02:11,608 --> 00:02:13,276
[SARUKUI]
Yeah!

12
00:02:14,844 --> 00:02:16,045
[BOKUTO]
Oh.

13
00:02:18,047 --> 00:02:20,517
(FUKURODANI cheers)

14
00:02:20,617 --> 00:02:26,289
[TAKEDA]
It might just be me...
But Fukurodani's really...
got it together?

15
00:02:26,389 --> 00:02:27,624
[KEISHIN]
Yeah.

16
00:02:28,792 --> 00:02:29,492
[AKAASHI]
Chance ball!

17
00:02:29,593 --> 00:02:30,594
[KOMI]
Here!

18
00:02:31,695 --> 00:02:33,062
(internal) Right now,
Fukurodani's

19
00:02:33,162 --> 00:02:34,731
front line attack
is two people.

20
00:02:34,831 --> 00:02:37,400
[TOBIO]
Are they going for a quick
attack from the center,

21
00:02:37,501 --> 00:02:41,505
or a back row attack, or will
No.4 finally make his move?

22
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:45,875
(TOBIO shock)
(whistle)

23
00:02:45,975 --> 00:02:48,878
[UBUGAWA A]
A setter dump! Fukurodani turned
the game back around again!

24
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:50,980
[UBUGAWA B]
And their ace player hasn't
made a single shot yet!

25
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,518
[ERI]
Bokuto's such a goof.
He thinks he's the big
brother of the group,

26
00:02:54,618 --> 00:02:57,186
[ERI] but in reality he's more
like the baby of the family.
[SARUKUI] Nice one, Akaashi.

27
00:02:57,286 --> 00:03:00,456
[AKAASHI] Thank you very much.
[ERI] That being said, he is the
strongest player, though.

28
00:03:01,958 --> 00:03:03,326
[AKAASHI]
Nice receive!

29
00:03:03,426 --> 00:03:05,562
[KOMI, internal]
We're all used to
Bokuto's slumps.

30
00:03:05,662 --> 00:03:08,732
[KONOHA, internal]
The most trivial things lift him
up or bring him down so easily.

31
00:03:08,832 --> 00:03:10,033
[SARUKUI]
Left!

32
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:12,101
[SARUKUI, internal]
He's hopeless, really.

33
00:03:13,436 --> 00:03:15,171
(whistle)
(FUKURODANI cheers)

34
00:03:15,271 --> 00:03:17,073
[UBUGAWA A]
Match point for Fukurodani!

35
00:03:17,173 --> 00:03:20,176
[YUKIE & KAORI]
Let's go! Whoo!

36
00:03:20,276 --> 00:03:23,012
Fukurodani isn't a team
in which Bokuto leads...

37
00:03:23,112 --> 00:03:28,084
[KEISHIN]
but rather they are a team...
where everyone else leads the
way for Bokuto.

38
00:03:28,752 --> 00:03:30,319
[AKAASHI]
One touch!

39
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:32,388
[KEI, internal]
I understand now
that Fukurodani isn't

40
00:03:32,488 --> 00:03:36,826
a one‐man team run by
Bokuto. Even so...

41
00:03:36,926 --> 00:03:38,795
(whistle)
[KONOHA]
Oh man...

42
00:03:38,895 --> 00:03:42,031
[KEI, internal]
Individually, there is nobody
scarier than him on their team.

43
00:03:42,131 --> 00:03:43,533
[KOSHI, SHOYO, & TADASHI]
Good stuff guys!

44
00:03:43,633 --> 00:03:46,770
[KOSHI]
Alright, one more point
and it's a deuce!

45
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:50,206
[KUROO]
Oh, good job there.

46
00:03:51,741 --> 00:03:54,944
[ASAHI]
If I miss this serve,
then the game is over.

47
00:03:55,044 --> 00:03:58,214
I have to make sure
to get it in!

48
00:03:58,815 --> 00:03:59,849
(KEISHIN concerned)

49
00:03:59,949 --> 00:04:02,218
[SARUKUI] Komi!
[KOMI] Hmph, yeah!

50
00:04:02,318 --> 00:04:04,621
[AKAASHI]
Nice receive!

51
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,222
[AKAASHI, internal]
Karasuno should have realized

52
00:04:06,322 --> 00:04:08,224
what kind of team we are by now.

53
00:04:08,324 --> 00:04:11,327
In other words, they're not
paying attention to the ace.

54
00:04:11,427 --> 00:04:16,600
[AKAASHI, internal]
And, this is about the time
when Bokuto starts getting all
fidgety, wanting the ball again!

55
00:04:17,667 --> 00:04:20,069
(KEI alarmed)

56
00:04:20,169 --> 00:04:22,271
[KOMI, WASHIO, & SARUKUI,
internal] We'll give all the
good sets to you!

57
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:23,940
[KONOHA, ONAGA, AKAASHI]
Sooo...

58
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:27,243
[FUKURODANI]
It's time to get back up, Ace!

59
00:04:37,721 --> 00:04:38,788
(AKAASHI smirk)

60
00:04:38,888 --> 00:04:40,757
(KEI annoyed)

61
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:43,326
(whistle) (long whistle)

62
00:04:43,426 --> 00:04:45,294
(SHOYO, TADASHI, & KOSHI gawk)

63
00:04:45,394 --> 00:04:47,063
(KEISHIN, TAKEDA, & HITOKA gawk)

64
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,032
(RYUNOSUKE frustrated)

65
00:04:49,132 --> 00:04:51,234
(AKAASHI catching breath)

66
00:04:55,639 --> 00:04:57,541
[AKAASHI, internal]
Help me out guys.

67
00:04:57,641 --> 00:04:58,875
[KOMI, SARUKUI, & KONOHA,
internal] Leave it to us.

68
00:04:58,975 --> 00:05:00,744
[SARUKUI]
Yo, Ace!

69
00:05:00,844 --> 00:05:02,111
[KONOHA]
That was super awesome!

70
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:04,914
[KOMI]
In the end, it just
has to be the ace!

71
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,016
[YUKIE]
You look like your
hair exploded!

72
00:05:07,116 --> 00:05:08,251
[KAORI]
Horned owl head!

73
00:05:08,351 --> 00:05:12,922
(BOKUTO slowly cracking up)

74
00:05:13,022 --> 00:05:20,496
[BOKUTO]
I am the best volleyball player
ever! Whoooo! Hey, hey, hey!

75
00:05:20,597 --> 00:05:22,465
[KOMI, KONOHA, SARUKUI]
Hey, hey, hey!

76
00:05:22,566 --> 00:05:25,869
[YUKIE]
As always, he sure manages to
recover quick.

77
00:05:25,969 --> 00:05:28,204
[KAORI]
That's what happens when you
have a tiny brain.

78
00:05:28,304 --> 00:05:32,075
[KEISHIN]
The weakness of their ace draws
out the strengths of the other
members.

79
00:05:32,175 --> 00:05:36,746
[KEISHIN]
And at the same time, it becomes
the foundation that prevents
them from crumbling apart.

80
00:05:36,846 --> 00:05:39,549
[KEISHIN]
Well well well. Strength comes
in many forms. Hmm?

81
00:05:39,649 --> 00:05:42,686
[TAKEDA]
Honestly, I had thought that if
we could just stop Bokuto,

82
00:05:42,786 --> 00:05:45,221
that would be enough
to care of these guys.

83
00:05:45,321 --> 00:05:46,856
[TAKEDA]
But that was too simple, huh.

84
00:05:46,956 --> 00:05:49,492
[KEISHIN]
For a team to allow a player to
be so arrogant...

85
00:05:49,593 --> 00:05:51,795
and move around
wherever he wants...

86
00:05:51,895 --> 00:05:54,531
[BOKUTO] I really am pretty
amazing aren't I?
[KEISHIN]
...it really all comes down to

87
00:05:54,631 --> 00:05:56,232
[AKAASHI]
Yes yes of course you are,
Bokuto.

88
00:05:56,332 --> 00:05:58,201
Right now, we've got
plenty of egos

89
00:05:58,301 --> 00:06:00,737
to go around but not
enough of the trust.

90
00:06:00,837 --> 00:06:03,072
[ASAHI]
(wailing) Sorry!

91
00:06:03,172 --> 00:06:07,844
[ASAHI]
I'm sorry Coach, I chickened out
and hit a serve that was just
asking them to attack us!

92
00:06:07,944 --> 00:06:12,115
[KEISHIN]
(surprised) Well, Man‐Bun has a
catharsis, now we're moving in
the right direction.

93
00:06:12,215 --> 00:06:16,485
[ALL] Huh?
[KEISHIN] It's taking care of
the ball and doing what it takes
to stay on offense

94
00:06:16,586 --> 00:06:18,688
[KEISHIN]
that determines whether or not
you finish on top.

95
00:06:18,788 --> 00:06:22,358
[KEISHIN]
Nobody wants to end the game on
their own mistake.

96
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:24,928
[TOBIO] He's talking about you.
[SHOYO] Shut your face!

97
00:06:25,028 --> 00:06:28,331
[KEISHIN]
But... nobody on the team is
ever going to blame you...

98
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,867
for hitting a serve that's
meant to take the win.

99
00:06:30,967 --> 00:06:32,702
(TADASHI gasps)
[ASAHI] Yessir.

100
00:06:32,802 --> 00:06:35,672
[KEISHIN]
Now that said. It's been a long,
hard, embarrassing,

101
00:06:35,772 --> 00:06:39,743
humiliating losing streak.
But one thing is for certain:

102
00:06:39,843 --> 00:06:42,045
(KEISHIN smirking)

103
00:06:42,145 --> 00:06:43,747
[KEISHIN]
This offense will work.

104
00:06:43,847 --> 00:06:47,483
And I'd take it against any of
the top teams in the country!

105
00:06:56,059 --> 00:06:59,228
[TAKEDA]
At the moment, neither your
serves nor your combination
plays

106
00:06:59,328 --> 00:07:01,330
are matching up against
other teams.

107
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:04,167
That is to be expected, because
you started way after them.

108
00:07:04,267 --> 00:07:09,238
[TAKEDA]
But, you shouldn't stop there.
Don't think that your abilities
will only take you this far.

109
00:07:09,338 --> 00:07:14,711
[TAKEDA]
Think of it this way; when you
mix colors, they get muddled and
lose what they once were.

110
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:20,550
[TAKEDA]
But, when they're all mixed
together, it turns to black. A
color that cannot be changed.

111
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:25,054
[TAKEDA]
And that's us. Black.
Like the crows we are!

112
00:07:25,154 --> 00:07:26,556
(TOBIO & SHOYO confused)

113
00:07:26,656 --> 00:07:29,192
[TAKEDA]
I'm sorry that metaphor
was a bit of a reach.

114
00:07:29,292 --> 00:07:31,394
[DAICHI]
No! I think it was perfect!

115
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,630
[KURASUNO]
Thank you very much!

116
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,533
[DAICHI]
All right, our last penalty lap
of training camp!

117
00:07:36,633 --> 00:07:38,635
[DAICHI]
One lap, floor flies!

118
00:07:38,735 --> 00:07:40,436
[KURASUNO]
Right!

119
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:44,774
[YU] Asahi!
[ASAHI] Oh?

120
00:07:44,874 --> 00:07:46,910
[YU]
We still have some time
before we get started.

121
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,344
Could you hit a few sets?

122
00:07:48,444 --> 00:07:49,813
[ASAHI]
Oh sure.

123
00:07:49,913 --> 00:07:52,181
[RYUNOSUKE]
Noya! Let me hit a few
of those, too!

124
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,817
[YU]
Yeah! Sure thing, Tanaka!

125
00:07:53,917 --> 00:07:55,519
[KOSHI] Oh, me, too!
[YU, RYUNOSUKE, & ASAHI] Hm?

126
00:07:55,619 --> 00:07:57,854
[RYUNOSUKE]
Oh, so you'll toss them
up for us, Suga?

127
00:07:57,954 --> 00:07:59,022
Thanks, man!

128
00:07:59,122 --> 00:08:00,624
Oh no, that's not it.

129
00:08:00,724 --> 00:08:03,359
[YU, RYUNOSUKE, & ASAHI] Huh?
[KOSHI] I'm a hitter.

130
00:08:05,995 --> 00:08:09,398
[TOBIO]
Ah, crap. If we could've nailed
more quick attacks,

131
00:08:09,498 --> 00:08:12,268
we might have been able to
take a set from Fukurodani!

132
00:08:12,368 --> 00:08:15,605
[SHOYO] But, with this,
we can fight.
[TOBIO] Hm?

133
00:08:15,705 --> 00:08:23,780
[SHOYO]
Even if they predict our
strategies, or catch up to
us... we can fight! (giggle)

134
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:25,682
[TOBIO]
That depends on my set,
though...

135
00:08:25,782 --> 00:08:28,351
[SHOYO]
Yeah well you're gonna get it
right, so it'll be okay.

136
00:08:28,451 --> 00:08:30,353
[TOBIO]
Don't just assume stuff
about me on your own!

137
00:08:30,453 --> 00:08:32,221
[SHOYO]
Then what, so you won't
be able to do it?

138
00:08:32,321 --> 00:08:34,190
[TOBIO]
Of course I'll be able
to do it, moron!

139
00:08:34,290 --> 00:08:36,025
[SHOYO]
See, that's what
I'm talking about!

140
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,528
[TOBIO]
We're gonna practice the
quick‐attack for a little bit!
[KEI]

141
00:08:38,628 --> 00:08:40,564
[SHOYO]
All right!
(TADASHI cracking up)

142
00:08:40,664 --> 00:08:42,198
[KOSHI]
(sigh) When we get back,

143
00:08:42,298 --> 00:08:44,768
we're having the Spring
Nationals preliminaries
right away.

144
00:08:44,868 --> 00:08:46,736
[DAICHI]
Yeah. Y'know I guess you're
right,

145
00:08:46,836 --> 00:08:48,805
it will be just about
that time won't it?

146
00:08:48,905 --> 00:08:51,074
Hopefully it'll be a
bit cooler by then.

147
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:53,276
(ASAHI jittery)
[KOSHI] But there will be some
lingering summer heat.

148
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:55,144
[DAICHI]
Why'd you say that, Suga?

149
00:08:55,244 --> 00:08:57,881
[ASAHI]
If we can't get past the
prelims, we won't come
here ever again...

150
00:08:57,981 --> 00:09:01,284
[KOSHI] What was that?!
Why are you being so negative.
[ASAHI] No wait...

151
00:09:01,384 --> 00:09:04,287
[DAICHI]
Of course we're all going to be
coming back here, don't worry.

152
00:09:04,387 --> 00:09:06,856
[ASAHI] Yeah you're
right. I'm sorry.
[KOSHI] Negativity, be gone!

153
00:09:06,956 --> 00:09:12,461
[ASAHI]
(gut punch) Y'know... you uh,
you sounded kinda like Kageyama
just now.

154
00:09:12,562 --> 00:09:14,430
[DAICHI]
Come on, Hinata, you dumbass!

155
00:09:14,531 --> 00:09:16,165
[KOSHI] You're just like him!
[ASAHI] There it is again!

156
00:09:16,265 --> 00:09:17,867
[SHOYO]
(shivers) S‐somehow I feel like

157
00:09:17,967 --> 00:09:20,136
I'm being yelled at a
little more than usual.

158
00:09:20,236 --> 00:09:21,671
(TOBIO confused)

159
00:09:29,045 --> 00:09:30,379
[BOKUTO]
All right! Meat!

160
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,315
[YU]
I am going to eat everything!

161
00:09:32,415 --> 00:09:35,451
[KIYOKO] Hey Yachi... Could
you take the plates over to
Miyanoshita please?

162
00:09:35,552 --> 00:09:36,319
[HITOKA]
Sure!

163
00:09:36,419 --> 00:09:37,621
[KAORI]
Peppers.

164
00:09:37,721 --> 00:09:39,055
(ERI crying)

165
00:09:39,155 --> 00:09:42,626
[KEI]
So I guess even Bokuto has
times where he's in a slump.

166
00:09:42,726 --> 00:09:47,664
[AKAASHI]
Yeah... Well, he self‐destructs
whenever we're doing things we
don't quite understand.

167
00:09:47,764 --> 00:09:51,434
[BOKUTO] Ribs, skirt steak,
tongue with salt, entrails...
[AKAASHI]
But even if our enemy is strong,

168
00:09:51,535 --> 00:09:55,071
[BOKUTO] liver... sirloin...
tripe... intestines... so juicy.
[AKAASHI]
And if our guys are getting

169
00:09:55,171 --> 00:09:58,341
[AKAASHI]
In many ways, he's the most
reliable player on the team.

170
00:09:58,441 --> 00:09:59,843
[SHOYO] Bokuto!
[BOKUTO] Huh?

171
00:09:59,943 --> 00:10:01,878
Um. In an actual game,
we not gonna lose to you!

172
00:10:01,978 --> 00:10:05,248
[BOKUTO]
Sure! (boastful laughing)
We'll take you on!

173
00:10:05,348 --> 00:10:08,785
(BOKUTO's
stomach growling)

174
00:10:08,885 --> 00:10:12,856
[BOKUTO]
(chuckle) Before the Spring
Nationals, first we have...

175
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:16,593
a competition for
the meat, Hinata!

176
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:21,130
[NEKOMATA]
(clears throat) Thank you all
for your hard work. It's been
a great training camp!

177
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:25,535
(stomachs growling)
[NEKOMATA] And now you can
fill your bellies as much
as you want.

178
00:10:25,635 --> 00:10:28,972
Let your muscles repair
themselves to your heart's
content.

179
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:30,907
(SHOYO & TOBIO food lust)

180
00:10:31,007 --> 00:10:33,943
[ALL]
"Time to eeeeat!"

181
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:42,351
(TOBIO choking)

182
00:10:42,451 --> 00:10:44,453
[KUROO]
And then, poor Kenma
was all like...

183
00:10:44,554 --> 00:10:46,723
[KUROO]
Ah! Hey! Oh hell no Bokuto!

184
00:10:46,823 --> 00:10:49,225
[KUROO]
You are not getting all the
meat you son of a bitch!

185
00:10:49,325 --> 00:10:50,660
[KAORI]
Here have some rice balls!

186
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:52,295
[ASAHI]
Sure, I'll have a‐ Huh?

187
00:10:52,395 --> 00:10:53,429
[YUKIE]
Don't mind if I do! (swallows)

188
00:10:53,530 --> 00:10:55,131
(ALL disgusted)

189
00:10:58,668 --> 00:11:00,804
[YU]
Do you understand? Tanaka?

190
00:11:00,904 --> 00:11:04,073
[RYUNOSUKE] Yes
of course. Tiger head?
[YAMAMOTO] Yes, Master.

191
00:11:04,173 --> 00:11:05,942
[YU]
There shall be no dudes...

192
00:11:06,042 --> 00:11:10,079
Allowed to use this event
to hit on Kiyoko! Or there
will be hell!

193
00:11:10,179 --> 00:11:12,115
[RYUNOSUKE & YAMAMOTO]
Your wish is our command!

194
00:11:13,382 --> 00:11:15,952
(KONOHA & KOMI ogling trance)

195
00:11:16,052 --> 00:11:18,555
[KONOHA] Go talk to her!
C'mon don't be a wuss.
[KOMI] No, you go!

196
00:11:18,655 --> 00:11:19,889
(KOMI & KONOHA startled)

197
00:11:20,456 --> 00:11:21,958
(YU intense growl)

198
00:11:22,058 --> 00:11:23,326
(RYUNOSUKE intense growl)

199
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:24,561
(YAMAMOTO intense growl)

200
00:11:24,661 --> 00:11:28,331
(KOMI & KONOHA fear
of god instilled)

201
00:11:28,431 --> 00:11:30,700
[TADASHI]
So uh why is Nishinoya
the master?

202
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,603
[KEI]
Well apparently it's because he
is the chosen one,

203
00:11:33,703 --> 00:11:36,172
the only person to have been
slapped in the face by Kiyoko.

204
00:11:36,272 --> 00:11:38,908
[TADASHI] Aaah... (chuckles)
[DAICHI] Tsukishima!
[TADASHI & KEI] Hmm?

205
00:11:39,008 --> 00:11:41,310
[DAICHI, mouthful]
You need to eat more food!

206
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,613
[KEI]
No... I've had enough thank you.

207
00:11:43,713 --> 00:11:45,248
[KUROO] Come on,
eat vegetables, too!
(KENMA startled)

208
00:11:45,348 --> 00:11:47,416
(TADASHI & KEI confused)
[KUROO] You too, Kenma,
I see you!

209
00:11:47,517 --> 00:11:49,118
[DAICHI]
Here y'go have some rice!

210
00:11:49,218 --> 00:11:51,420
(KENMA refusing)
[BOKUTO] Meat! You gotta eat
meat, Tsukki‐dude!

211
00:11:51,521 --> 00:11:54,558
[BOKUTO] Or you won't be able
to grow up and be all big and
strong.
[KOSHI]

212
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:57,193
[BOKUTO] Don't you wanna be
big and strong like me?!
[YAKU]
Well he must think his relatives

213
00:11:57,293 --> 00:11:59,529
[BOKUTO] I'm telling you.
It's no secret.
[KAI]
I'd say if they're

214
00:11:59,629 --> 00:12:01,665
[BOKUTO] You gotta eat meat!
[KAI]
makes perfect sense.

215
00:12:01,765 --> 00:12:04,033
[YAKU] Oh? You know, Suga?
[KOSHI] Huh?

216
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:07,571
[YAKU]
Blonde girl from your school...
she's acting suspicious. Is she
okay?

217
00:12:07,671 --> 00:12:10,907
(KOSHI shocked)
(HITOKA spazzing out)
[HITOKA, internal]
Th‐this is just like...

218
00:12:13,242 --> 00:12:15,144
[HITOKA]
a jungle of giants!

219
00:12:15,244 --> 00:12:19,549
[HITOKA, internal]
(nervous) Oh man that smells
good... I gotta have some!

220
00:12:19,649 --> 00:12:22,118
[WASHIO]
Oh, this one looks good.
[HITOKA, internal]
But if I plunge into that mess,

221
00:12:22,218 --> 00:12:25,088
[ISAHARA] Hey, that's
the one I was about to eat!
[WASHIO] You snooze
you lose, nerd.

222
00:12:25,188 --> 00:12:27,991
[GOURA]
Hm? Can you reach it?
Do you want one?

223
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,660
[HITOKA]
(startled) No!
I wouldn't taste good!

224
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,563
(GOURA confused)
[HITOKA]
Oh no, wait... I... I'm fine!

225
00:12:33,663 --> 00:12:38,367
[HITOKA]
I'm not a crazy person. I think
I'll just go with this one right
here. (chokes it down)

226
00:12:38,467 --> 00:12:40,136
(CHIGAYA & ASAHI mortified)

227
00:12:40,236 --> 00:12:41,738
[HITOKA]
I‐it's delicious!

228
00:12:41,838 --> 00:12:44,073
It tastes like meaty heaven...
(miserable)

229
00:12:44,173 --> 00:12:45,575
[ASAHI]
Uuuh Yachi?

230
00:12:45,675 --> 00:12:47,343
The one you just ate looked
like it was really burnt,

231
00:12:47,443 --> 00:12:48,578
are you all right?

232
00:12:48,678 --> 00:12:49,879
[WASHIO]
You need some tea?

233
00:12:49,979 --> 00:12:51,414
[ONAGA]
We have some water too?

234
00:12:51,515 --> 00:12:52,916
[OGANO]
Hey man...

235
00:12:53,016 --> 00:12:54,884
are you like checking
out the scene over there?

236
00:12:54,984 --> 00:12:57,286
[CHIGAYA]
Hmm? Yeah, if it was in the
middle of town,

237
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:59,122
someone might call the cops.

238
00:12:59,222 --> 00:13:01,124
[CHIGAYA]
I wouldn't want to
be her right now.

239
00:13:01,224 --> 00:13:04,393
[OGANO]
Oh! (dreamy sigh)

240
00:13:04,493 --> 00:13:06,530
(ERI & KIYOKO soft giggling)

241
00:13:06,630 --> 00:13:08,431
[KAORI] Ha!
(YUKIE munching)

242
00:13:08,532 --> 00:13:11,835
[KAORI]
Where do you put all that?
[OGANO]
I think I'd like to be

243
00:13:11,935 --> 00:13:16,439
[MAKO]
Y'know those third‐years from
Karasuno... They seem like they
have their act together.

244
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:19,543
[OGANO]
The managers of the
Fukurodani Group are at
a high aesthetic level.

245
00:13:19,643 --> 00:13:21,511
But with Karasuno joining us...

246
00:13:21,611 --> 00:13:22,979
Overall hotness levels
in the vicinity

247
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:25,649
have substantially increased.
What say you, sir?

248
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:27,016
[CHIGAYA]
I have no objections.

249
00:13:27,116 --> 00:13:29,352
[KIYOKO]
Our ace is really
a big old softy.

250
00:13:29,452 --> 00:13:32,756
[ERI]
Huh? Are you serious? But he
looks so big and scary.

251
00:13:32,856 --> 00:13:35,659
[KAORI]
Though, I think that's
better than having such
a simple‐minded ace...

252
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:39,996
[SHOYO]
(amazed) The top five in the
entire nation...? That's so
cool!

253
00:13:40,096 --> 00:13:43,166
[BOKUTO]
Isn't it? Isn't it though?!
(boastful laugh)

254
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,669
[KUROO]
Yeah well someone from your
region is up there, y'know.

255
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:48,204
That big fella Ushiwaka's
in the top three.

256
00:13:48,304 --> 00:13:52,108
[SHOYO] Three?!
[BOKUTO] Hey! Hello I'm
right over here you know!

257
00:13:52,208 --> 00:13:55,779
[HAIBA]
Okay so three means that...
there's like two more left
right?

258
00:13:55,879 --> 00:14:00,684
[KUROO]
Hmm? Ushiwaka from
the Tohoku region,

259
00:14:00,784 --> 00:14:04,821
[KUROO]
Kiryu from the Kyushu
region, and Sakusa from
the Kanto region.

260
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:09,025
[KUROO]
Those are the three strongest
aces at the national high
school level this year.

261
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:11,427
(SHOYO & HAIBA amazed)
(BOKUTO unimpressed)

262
00:14:11,528 --> 00:14:15,064
[KEI]
Believe it or not, one of those
three aces is in Miyagi, of all
places...

263
00:14:15,164 --> 00:14:18,735
[BOKUTO]
Hey, Tsukki‐poo! You practiced
a ton against my spikes!

264
00:14:18,835 --> 00:14:21,337
I will not allow you to
be intimidated by Ushiwaka!

265
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:23,940
[KEI]
For the love of God can you
stop calling me that.

266
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,543
[KUROO]
Besides, just 'cause they're
called the "top three aces" ...

267
00:14:26,643 --> 00:14:29,613
[KUROO]
doesn't mean their teams are
necessarily the top three teams.

268
00:14:29,713 --> 00:14:32,248
[BOKUTO] Right on, right on!
[KUROO] Though, Sakusa's
team, Itachiyama,

269
00:14:32,348 --> 00:14:35,785
is the heavy favorite to win
the nationals. Of course.

270
00:14:35,885 --> 00:14:39,422
[SHOYO] Then...
[SHOYO & HAIBA] So if we
defeat them, will we be
the best in Japan?

271
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:44,661
[KUROO] Hm? Yeah, you bet!
But you guys suck.
(SHOYO & HAIBA shocked)

272
00:14:44,761 --> 00:14:46,563
[HAIBA]
So what if Hinata is number one?

273
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:49,566
[SHOYO]
Well Kenma did say I was
better than you at serving
and receiving!

274
00:14:49,666 --> 00:14:51,668
[HAIBA]
What? No way!

275
00:14:54,671 --> 00:14:56,973
[TAKEDA] Coach Nekomata.
[NEKOMATA] Hmmm?

276
00:14:57,073 --> 00:14:59,408
[TAKEDA]
I wanted to thank you again...
for inviting us down here.

277
00:14:59,509 --> 00:15:03,379
[BOKUTO] But of course, you
weren't able stop my spikes,
were ya?!
[TAKEDA]

278
00:15:03,479 --> 00:15:06,282
[SHOYO] So Lev, is it true you
caught that cat?
[NEKOMATA]
Oh no, it seems we've gotten

279
00:15:06,382 --> 00:15:09,285
[HAIBA] Yeah well Kenma's arms
were too short, so he couldn't
reach it.
[NEKOMATA]

280
00:15:10,787 --> 00:15:12,255
[NEKOMATA]
In six months time...

281
00:15:12,355 --> 00:15:13,757
Not one team in the
tournament will be

282
00:15:13,857 --> 00:15:15,992
the same as they are now.
Huh?

283
00:15:16,092 --> 00:15:20,496
They will be new teams,
with completely different
playing styles.

284
00:15:20,597 --> 00:15:24,668
[DAICHI] Oh I see. So Tokyo's
preliminaries are scheduled a
bit later then.
[NEKOMATA]

285
00:15:24,768 --> 00:15:30,239
[KUROO] Well, we do have
a lot of schools.
[NEKOMATA]
But it is still my wish for

286
00:15:30,339 --> 00:15:34,778
[NEKOMATA]
And the only way to do that is
to offer nothing but our very
best effort.

287
00:15:35,745 --> 00:15:37,080
[TAKEDA]
Right.

288
00:15:45,154 --> 00:15:46,556
(TOBIO yawning)

289
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,458
[SHOYO] I hate being the weakest
one on the team, but..
[TOBIO] Huh?

290
00:15:49,559 --> 00:15:54,297
[SHOYO]
The fact that there are so many
people up above me...

291
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:57,466
[SHOYO]
is something that drives
me to get better!

292
00:15:58,768 --> 00:16:00,737
[KEI, TADASHI, & TOBIO]
Huh?

293
00:16:01,905 --> 00:16:03,940
[KUROO]
Well, see you again.

294
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:06,375
[DAICHI]
Yeah. Look forward to it.

295
00:16:08,344 --> 00:16:10,880
[TAKEDA]
The summer break
training camp...

296
00:16:13,683 --> 00:16:15,919
[TAKEDA]
It's finally come to an end.

297
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:39,709
[TAKEDA]
If we win twice in
tomorrow's preliminaries,

298
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,612
[TAKEDA]
we will be able to advance to
the tournament in October,

299
00:16:42,712 --> 00:16:44,614
which decides all the
area representatives.

300
00:16:44,714 --> 00:16:47,751
[TAKEDA]
On top of the eight schools
that win the first round of
preliminaries,

301
00:16:47,851 --> 00:16:51,788
[TAKEDA]
...eight more powerhouse schools
will join for the rest of the
tournament.

302
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,991
[SHOYO]
So we can only play two games
max in the first round of the
prelims.

303
00:16:55,091 --> 00:16:59,095
[KOSHI]
Well since we made it into the
top 16 in the Inter High
preliminaries,

304
00:16:59,195 --> 00:17:01,531
that means we us got a bye
for the first round.

305
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,133
[SHOYO]
(amazed) Yeah. We rock!

306
00:17:05,969 --> 00:17:08,304
[DAICHI] All right,
let's start with stretches!
[HITOKA]
Finally, finally...

307
00:17:08,404 --> 00:17:10,907
[KURASUNO] Yessir!
[HITOKA]
I‐I‐I'm starting to
get really nervous.

308
00:17:11,007 --> 00:17:14,043
(KURASUNO stretch counting)
[KIYOKO]
Oh yeah, Yachi, this'll be your
first tournament won't it.

309
00:17:14,143 --> 00:17:15,411
[HITOKA]
That's right...

310
00:17:15,512 --> 00:17:17,113
[DAICHI]
1, 2, 3, 4!

311
00:17:17,213 --> 00:17:19,716
[KIYOKO] For us..
This will be the last one.
[ALL] 5, 6, 7, 8!

312
00:17:19,816 --> 00:17:23,052
[DAICHI] 1, 2, 3, 4!
(HITOKA tearing up)

313
00:17:23,152 --> 00:17:26,055
[KIYOKO]
Oh! Sorry, sorry! I didn't
mean to make you cry!

314
00:17:26,155 --> 00:17:28,892
[HITOKA]
I... I'm not! It's just that a
mosquito got into my eye...!

315
00:17:28,992 --> 00:17:30,326
[KIYOKO]
A mosquito?

316
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:31,561
[YU]
Here goes!

317
00:17:31,661 --> 00:17:33,429
(practice chatter)

318
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:35,131
[KOSHI]
Let's go!

319
00:17:37,767 --> 00:17:39,068
[YU]
Bring it on!

320
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:40,937
[TADASHI, internal]
I won't serve to the libero.

321
00:17:41,037 --> 00:17:44,974
I won't serve to the libero.
I won't serve to the libero...

322
00:17:47,343 --> 00:17:49,679
[TADASHI]
Why does it always go exactly
where I don't want it to?

323
00:17:49,779 --> 00:17:53,550
[YU]
That was a nice serve Tadashi!
It was pretty tough for me to
reach!

324
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:55,151
[TADASHI]
Oh, okay...

325
00:17:55,251 --> 00:17:58,487
[TADASHI, internal]
Well, he sure made it look
easy...

326
00:17:58,588 --> 00:17:59,689
[TADASHI, internal]
One more!

327
00:17:59,789 --> 00:18:00,957
[KEISHIN]
What are you reading

328
00:18:01,057 --> 00:18:02,091
that's so interesting, Specs?

329
00:18:02,191 --> 00:18:04,260
[TAKEDA]
Oh uh hey Coach...

330
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,396
[TAKEDA]
Well, we know our
first‐years are amazing,

331
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:10,700
but I was thinking about the
other amazing first‐years out
there too...

332
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:15,004
[KEISHIN]
Oh... that guy. Yeah...

333
00:18:15,438 --> 00:18:16,873
[YU]
Hey!

334
00:18:19,408 --> 00:18:20,610
[KEI]
I'm home.

335
00:18:22,512 --> 00:18:24,914
[AKITERU]
Man, just look how
much you've grown!

336
00:18:25,014 --> 00:18:27,450
[AKITERU]
Of course, I guess you've been
taller than me for a while now.

337
00:18:27,551 --> 00:18:30,587
[KEI]
(surprised) Hey bro.

338
00:18:30,687 --> 00:18:33,022
[AKITERU]
S'been... a long time.

339
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:37,894
[AKITERU]
I don't even remember the last
time I've gotten to really talk
to you.

340
00:18:37,994 --> 00:18:39,529
[KEI]
Oh really is that so?

341
00:18:39,629 --> 00:18:41,831
[AKITERU]
Even whenever I come
back home to visit,

342
00:18:41,931 --> 00:18:44,367
you're usually cooped
up in your room or whatever.

343
00:18:44,467 --> 00:18:46,435
[KEI]
Is that so?

344
00:18:46,536 --> 00:18:49,205
[AKITERU]
So uh... You seem a bit
different than before.

345
00:18:49,305 --> 00:18:51,841
You went to that training
camp, right? How did it go?

346
00:18:51,941 --> 00:18:53,843
[KEI]
Uh... it was normal...

347
00:18:53,943 --> 00:18:57,046
[AKITERU]
I dunno, your face tells me
that it was pretty rough!

348
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:03,252
[KEI]
You still play volleyball
sometimes right?

349
00:19:03,352 --> 00:19:05,655
[AKITERU]
Yeah, I'm on a team.

350
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,591
[KEI]
You have tournaments and stuff?

351
00:19:07,691 --> 00:19:10,026
[AKITERU]
Yeah. Of course.

352
00:19:10,126 --> 00:19:11,427
[AKITERU]
I guess you're probably
wondering

353
00:19:11,528 --> 00:19:13,630
why I even bother
still playing, right?

354
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,231
(KEI uneasy)

355
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:24,741
[AKITERU] Well y'know... I just
never really wanted to stop.
(KEI surprised)

356
00:19:24,841 --> 00:19:28,812
[AKITERU]
Listen, when I look back at how
everything went, I still get
frustrated.

357
00:19:28,912 --> 00:19:31,214
It was never anything I wanted.

358
00:19:31,314 --> 00:19:34,383
[AKITERU]
I mean, what you saw was such
a disgrace for me, too.

359
00:19:34,483 --> 00:19:35,919
(KEI apathetic exhale)

360
00:19:36,019 --> 00:19:40,123
High school wasn't what
I'd hoped. Didn't turn out
like I wanted.

361
00:19:40,223 --> 00:19:43,627
I didn't get the uh... parts of
volleyball I love most.

362
00:19:43,727 --> 00:19:46,596
But... I had already felt it...

363
00:19:47,797 --> 00:19:50,366
[AKITERU]
I had felt how good it
feels to land a spike,

364
00:19:50,466 --> 00:19:53,737
[AKITERU] and to hear the
crowd cheering you on.
(CROWD roaring cheer)

365
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:58,474
[BOKUTO]
It's all about having a badass
personal moment like that.

366
00:19:58,575 --> 00:20:03,713
[AKITERU]
So I will keep playing...
Because I know it drives me to
be my best.

367
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:08,518
[KEI]
I see... So that's it...

368
00:20:16,459 --> 00:20:21,531
[UKAI]
You boys have games starting
tomorrow, right? You should
probably wrap it up soon!

369
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:23,533
[SHOYO]
One more please! Just one more!

370
00:20:23,633 --> 00:20:25,702
[TOBIO]
The next one is our
last, I promise!

371
00:20:25,802 --> 00:20:28,672
[SHOYO & TOBIO]
One more! Pleeease!
[MACHIKO]
You know... I think this is

372
00:20:28,772 --> 00:20:31,374
[UKAI] Okay. Just one.
[SHOYO & TOBIO] Thank you!
[COLLEGE GIRL]
They asked to borrow

373
00:20:31,474 --> 00:20:34,477
[TOBIO] All right, Hinata!
Let's make sure to nail this!
[COLLEGE GIRL]
we start up because they

374
00:20:34,578 --> 00:20:37,581
[SHOYO] Right on!
[COLLEGE GIRL] Apparently
he's the setter on Sho's team.

375
00:20:37,681 --> 00:20:38,615
[MACHIKO]
Heh...

376
00:20:38,715 --> 00:20:40,349
[OGASAWARA]
Here we go!

377
00:20:40,449 --> 00:20:42,418
[COLLEGE GIRL]
I've been watching them play
since I got back,

378
00:20:42,519 --> 00:20:45,488
and I gotta say, they're
really not very good.

379
00:20:50,594 --> 00:20:51,761
(UKAI stunned)

380
00:20:51,861 --> 00:20:52,996
(MACHIKO & COLLEGE GIRL stunned)

381
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:54,230
(OGASAWARA stunned)

382
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:57,433
(TOBIO & SHOYO impressed grins)

383
00:21:01,771 --> 00:21:03,873
[FUTAKUCHI]
Oh man, Kamasaki, I see you
dropped by again?

384
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:06,510
[FUTAKUCHI]
You bored or something? Is your
job search going all right?

385
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:08,344
[FUTAKUCHI]
Maybe it's because your sleeves
are rolled up too tight.

386
00:21:08,444 --> 00:21:10,379
[KAMASAKI]
Futakuchi you chode! Respect
your upperclassmen!

387
00:21:10,479 --> 00:21:13,617
(KAMASAKI & FUTAKUCHI forcefully
separated)

388
00:21:13,717 --> 00:21:17,420
[YUTARO]
Hey uh.... So... Was that story
that Oikawa told for real?

389
00:21:17,521 --> 00:21:22,559
[AKIRA]
It's probably real, right?
I mean, he does pretty crazy
things...

390
00:21:25,028 --> 00:21:27,063
(TORU frustrated)

391
00:21:27,163 --> 00:21:28,698
[TERUSHIMA]
Huh? Karasa‐what?

392
00:21:28,798 --> 00:21:30,033
[MISAKI]
It's "Karasuno."

393
00:21:30,133 --> 00:21:32,468
[TERUSHIMA]
Where's that? Never heard of it.

394
00:21:32,569 --> 00:21:35,338
[TERUSHIMA]
If we're strong enough to defeat
Shiratorizawa...

395
00:21:35,438 --> 00:21:37,907
We can win against any
team in the prefecture.

396
00:21:38,007 --> 00:21:40,176
Heh... It's that simple.

397
00:21:53,723 --> 00:21:56,860
[SHOYO]
I'm Shoyo Hinata, from the
Karasuno parking lot.

398
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:02,331
[SHOYO]
And I'm going to nationals.
After I kick your ass.

399
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,569
[USHIWAKA]
Gimme another one.

400
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:09,939
[TAKEDA]
August 11...

401
00:22:10,039 --> 00:22:13,777
[TAKEDA]
The Japanese National High
School Volleyball Championship
Tournament,

402
00:22:13,877 --> 00:22:17,346
[TAKEDA]
Also known as the Spring High
School Volleyball Championships.

403
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:22,118
[TAKEDA]
The first round of the Miyagi
prefectural representative
deciding tournament...

404
00:22:22,218 --> 00:22:24,153
starts today!

405
00:23:55,411 --> 00:23:58,381
[AKITERU]
Having a super huge guy can be
the difference between victory
and defeat!

406
00:23:58,481 --> 00:24:00,617
[KEI]
I'm not huge enough to be
called "super" huge.

407
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,886
[AKITERU]
Aw. You're so cute
when you a humble.

408
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:06,489
[KEI]
Don't expect a guy that is
almost 6'3" to be acting cute.

409
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:09,492
[KEI]
Next Haikyu!! "Match Begins!"
