1
00:00:05,529 --> 00:00:07,865
[SHOYO]
So where are we going, Coach?

2
00:00:07,965 --> 00:00:10,033
[KEISHIN]
You'll see when we get there.

3
00:00:14,104 --> 00:00:15,773
[BOY A]
Let's play some more at home!

4
00:00:15,873 --> 00:00:17,775
[BOY B]
Yeah. That was fun!

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:21,812
(TOBIO glare)

6
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:25,749
(BOY A whimpering into bawling)

7
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:26,884
[BOY B]
(concerned) Oh man, don't cry!

8
00:00:26,984 --> 00:00:28,519
[TOBIO]
Hm? Oh sorry...

9
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:30,254
[BOY C]
You made him cry!

10
00:00:30,354 --> 00:00:33,257
[TOBIO, internal]
What was I planning on doing
whenever I got here?

11
00:00:33,357 --> 00:00:35,226
[TOBIO, internal]
Whatever. It doesn't matter.

12
00:00:35,326 --> 00:00:37,795
[TAKERU]
Toru! I wanna learn how to
serve!

13
00:00:37,895 --> 00:00:40,631
[TORU]
Shhh... Not so loud. It's rude.

14
00:00:40,731 --> 00:00:43,867
[TOBIO]
(disbelief) O‐Oikawa!

15
00:00:47,037 --> 00:00:50,641
[UKAI]
Come on! Move those legs, kid!

16
00:00:50,741 --> 00:00:53,177
[OGASAWARA] Hey, nice receive!
[UKAI] One more!

17
00:00:53,277 --> 00:00:55,813
[KEISHIN] You just got
discharged from the hospital;
[BOY D] Aagh! That's impossible!
[OGASAWARA] You can get it!

18
00:00:55,913 --> 00:00:57,881
[KEISHIN]
shouldn't you be in
bed eating pudding?

19
00:00:57,981 --> 00:01:00,784
[UKAI]
Huh? Being discharged means
I'm all better.

20
00:01:00,884 --> 00:01:03,687
So I could go run a
marathon if I wanted to!

21
00:01:03,787 --> 00:01:06,557
[KEISHIN]
(not amused) Meet my grandpa.

22
00:01:06,657 --> 00:01:10,494
[SHOYO]
Huh? (shocked) You're...

23
00:01:10,594 --> 00:01:12,263
[SHOYO]
The old Coach Ukai!

24
00:01:12,363 --> 00:01:13,897
[UKAI]
Hmm?

25
00:02:49,593 --> 00:02:53,197
[UKAI]
So... you've chosen to
come to me with your tail
between your legs

26
00:02:53,297 --> 00:02:55,899
because you didn't know
what to do with that
insane quick attack...

27
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:58,402
Does that sound
about right, Coach?

28
00:03:00,003 --> 00:03:01,272
[UKAI] It's your team!
(KEISHIN screaming)

29
00:03:01,372 --> 00:03:03,073
[UKAI]
Are you spineless
or something, boy?!

30
00:03:03,174 --> 00:03:05,476
[SHOYO]
What the heck?! (trembling)

31
00:03:05,576 --> 00:03:07,144
Best coach we've ever had,

32
00:03:07,245 --> 00:03:10,248
made a name for Karasuno
getting to Spring Nationals.

33
00:03:10,348 --> 00:03:16,187
[RYUNOSUKE]
And because of that, the name
Ukai is pretty famous in the
volleyball world.

34
00:03:16,287 --> 00:03:18,956
[RYUNOSUKE]
Some people even call him
the Crazy Crow Coach.

35
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:20,724
(SHOYO nervous)

36
00:03:20,824 --> 00:03:23,093
[SHOYO]
I‐I'm ready, sir!

37
00:03:23,194 --> 00:03:29,400
[UKAI]
For what, kid? I don't normally
throw everybody I see across the
yard... just cowards like him.

38
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:31,635
[KEISHIN]
(struggling) Stupid
old fart... (grunt)

39
00:03:31,735 --> 00:03:38,141
I... I uh... I came here
because I want to learn
to fight on my own!

40
00:03:38,242 --> 00:03:41,779
Do you think you can
handle midair combat
as short as you are?

41
00:03:41,879 --> 00:03:43,681
[SHOYO]
That's exactly why I want to!

42
00:03:43,781 --> 00:03:45,283
[UKAI]
Huh?

43
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:51,121
[SHOYO]
I know... that's probably a
weird thing to say isn't it...

44
00:03:51,889 --> 00:03:53,023
[UKAI]
What's weird about it?

45
00:03:53,123 --> 00:03:55,193
(SHOYO surprised)

46
00:03:55,293 --> 00:03:58,028
[UKAI]
No matter what level of setter
you're dealing with...

47
00:03:58,128 --> 00:04:03,066
[UKAI]
Whenever you're using a quick
attack... the person who's
calling the shots...

48
00:04:03,167 --> 00:04:04,502
[UKAI]
...is you.

49
00:04:04,602 --> 00:04:05,636
(SHOYO gasps)

50
00:04:05,736 --> 00:04:07,571
(KEISHIN confused)
(long yell)

51
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:11,909
[UKAI]
Don't just stand there looking
stupid! You're supposed to be
the coach!

52
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:15,513
[TORU]
(annoyed) Hmph.

53
00:04:15,613 --> 00:04:18,148
[TOBIO]
O‐Oikawa, what are
you doing here?

54
00:04:18,249 --> 00:04:19,717
[TORU]
I'm here with my nephew.

55
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:20,751
[TAKERU]
'Sup!

56
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:21,952
[TOBIO]
Uh... Hey...

57
00:04:22,052 --> 00:04:23,221
What about practice?

58
00:04:23,321 --> 00:04:25,523
[TORU]
We almost always
take Mondays off.

59
00:04:25,623 --> 00:04:28,492
[TOBIO]
A day off every week?
Who does that?

60
00:04:28,592 --> 00:04:32,896
[TORU]
I'm not ditching. Just...
taking a break... Bye.

61
00:04:32,996 --> 00:04:34,665
[TOBIO]
O‐Oikawa, wait uh!

62
00:04:34,765 --> 00:04:38,202
You seeing this little man!
What do you think of this,
loser?!

63
00:04:38,302 --> 00:04:40,371
[TOBIO]
I haven't even said anything!

64
00:04:40,471 --> 00:04:44,208
[TOBIO] Oikawa‐
[TORU] Sorry pal,
I don't speak stupid!

65
00:04:46,244 --> 00:04:48,979
[TOBIO]
Oikawa please... listen
to what I have to say.

66
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:54,185
[TORU]
Why should I listen to you,
Mr. Prodigy? We're enemies,
remember?

67
00:04:54,285 --> 00:04:58,389
[TOBIO]
Please, Oikawa... It's
important! Come back!

68
00:04:58,489 --> 00:05:00,224
(TOBIO quivering)

69
00:05:01,925 --> 00:05:03,694
[TOBIO]
LISTEN TO ME, NOW!

70
00:05:03,794 --> 00:05:05,095
(TORU screaming)

71
00:05:05,196 --> 00:05:06,664
(stunned)

72
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,966
(annoyed)

73
00:05:09,066 --> 00:05:10,568
[TORU] Takeru.
[TAKERU] What?

74
00:05:10,668 --> 00:05:13,637
[TORU]
Take a picture. Hold my phone
and push this button.

75
00:05:13,737 --> 00:05:15,306
[TORU]
Tobio, don't move.

76
00:05:15,406 --> 00:05:17,341
[TORU]
Perfect... Now I've got a photo

77
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:20,278
of Tobio asking me for a favor.

78
00:05:21,245 --> 00:05:22,980
[TAKERU]
I gotta tell you, Uncle Toru,

79
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:24,648
this is a totally lame picture.

80
00:05:24,748 --> 00:05:26,550
(TORU startled into annoyed)

81
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:29,753
[TORU]
So, what is it?
I'm kinda busy here.

82
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:32,390
[TAKERU]
You said you were bored because
your girlfriend dumped you!

83
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,125
[TORU]
Hey Takeru, why don't
we play the quiet game?!

84
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:37,195
[TAKERU]
You were about to cry
about it earlier...

85
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,431
[TORU] I said let's
play the quiet game!
[TAKERU] Whatever...

86
00:05:40,531 --> 00:05:44,468
[TOBIO]
Ah... so uh... if you had a
tournament coming up...

87
00:05:44,568 --> 00:05:50,608
and if uhh... if Iwaizumi was
like insisting on pulling off
some risky kind of attack uh...

88
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,776
[TORU]
You know, if you're going
to ask me for advice,

89
00:05:52,876 --> 00:05:55,713
don't give me a bad metaphor,
just be up‐front about it.

90
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,581
[TOBIO]
Hmmm? (annoyed)

91
00:05:59,417 --> 00:06:02,286
[TOBIO]
Hinata used to do the quick
with his eyes closed...

92
00:06:02,386 --> 00:06:05,756
and well now he wants to
open his eyes instead.

93
00:06:05,856 --> 00:06:08,259
[TORU]
Hey, that would be great,
Why don't you let him try?

94
00:06:08,359 --> 00:06:13,597
[TOBIO]
Don't try'n make it sound like
it's so easy! Hinata has no
concept of technique!

95
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:17,301
Let me guess, you said
"just do what I tell
you to do", didn't you?

96
00:06:17,401 --> 00:06:19,370
Just like the dictator you are.

97
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,905
(TOBIO dumbfounded)
[TORU] Have you considered why

98
00:06:22,005 --> 00:06:25,409
[TORU]
you're having trouble responding
to Small Fry's request?

99
00:06:25,509 --> 00:06:29,680
[TORU]
Or whether or not you even want
to put in the effort at all?

100
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:30,814
[SHOYO]
Kageyama.

101
00:06:32,483 --> 00:06:34,718
[SHOYO]
Hey. Come set for me.

102
00:06:34,818 --> 00:06:40,591
[TORU]
You just want to stick to the
status quo and play it safe...
You're such a coward.

103
00:06:41,792 --> 00:06:43,561
But don't get it twisted...

104
00:06:43,661 --> 00:06:46,330
That quick‐attack isn't really
yours to control...

105
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,200
[TORU]
It's the Shorty's call.

106
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:57,007
[TORU]
And if you can't understand that
fact... you're every bit the
despot King you used to be.

107
00:06:57,107 --> 00:06:59,076
[TORU]
Let's go, Takeru.

108
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:02,246
(TOBIO brooding)

109
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:07,418
(TORU humming to self)

110
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,520
[TAKERU]
You're sure in a good mood.

111
00:07:09,620 --> 00:07:12,590
[TORU]
Kageyama is a lot more useless
than I thought...

112
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:15,893
And that makes me happy!
(gasp of disbelief)

113
00:07:15,993 --> 00:07:18,462
[TORU]
Dude! I'm totally out of focus!

114
00:07:19,330 --> 00:07:20,998
[UKAI]
It's not even about technique.

115
00:07:21,098 --> 00:07:22,700
[UKAI]
It's a problem with
your mindset.

116
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,102
(KEISHIN groans)
[UKAI] What do you personally
think about

117
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:27,405
that so‐called
deviant quick attack?

118
00:07:27,505 --> 00:07:32,310
[SHOYO]
Let's see... First I go "fwoosh"
like that... and then I jump
like buh‐BAM!

119
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:35,746
[SHOYO]
And that's when the ball goes
like SHWOOM... so I swing with a
whoosh,

120
00:07:35,846 --> 00:07:38,949
[SHOYO]
and it perfectly hits my hand,
and slash! We nail it.

121
00:07:39,049 --> 00:07:41,685
[KEISHIN]
Well... in other words, when he
closes his eyes and jumps,

122
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:45,256
[KEISHIN]
the setter‐ Kageyama‐ sets the
ball with pinpoint accuracy and
uh...

123
00:07:45,356 --> 00:07:47,591
[UKAI]
I think I understand well
enough.

124
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:50,428
[UKAI]
But you've got it all wrong,
little fella.

125
00:07:50,528 --> 00:07:53,130
[UKAI]
As long as it's a type of quick
attack...

126
00:07:53,231 --> 00:07:57,401
even for that deviant quick
attack, you have a weapon in
your arsenal.

127
00:07:57,501 --> 00:07:59,937
[UKAI]
Remember that. And make sure you
understand it.

128
00:08:00,037 --> 00:08:05,075
[UKAI]
The most effective weapon
is one in which you are
fluent and familiar.

129
00:08:05,176 --> 00:08:07,878
[UKAI]
Well... it's faster
to learn by doing.

130
00:08:07,978 --> 00:08:10,914
[UKAI]
Okay Shorty... why don't
you try blocking for a bit.

131
00:08:11,014 --> 00:08:14,952
You call yourself a middle
blocker, right? Let's see
whatcha got.

132
00:08:15,052 --> 00:08:16,119
(SHOYO surprised)

133
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,221
[OGASAWARA]
You go to middle school?

134
00:08:17,321 --> 00:08:18,289
[BOY D]
Which one?

135
00:08:18,389 --> 00:08:19,990
[SHOYO]
I am in high school!

136
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:22,726
[UKAI] All right, let's go!
[BOYS] Okay!

137
00:08:22,826 --> 00:08:25,062
[SHOYO, internal]
So this is set up for grade
school kids?

138
00:08:25,163 --> 00:08:27,398
I thought I had gotten
a little taller!

139
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,867
[UKAI]
Try Third Tempo!

140
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,635
[SHOYO, internal]
Third Tempo?

141
00:08:38,108 --> 00:08:41,279
[BOY D]
That's some jump you got!
Your face was above the net!

142
00:08:41,379 --> 00:08:42,780
[SHOYO]
(whimpering) Yeah. Thanks!

143
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,348
This kid certainly can jump.

144
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:47,084
He's on a spring.
All right, next!

145
00:08:47,185 --> 00:08:49,320
Second Tempo!

146
00:08:52,223 --> 00:08:54,192
[SHOYO, internal]
It's faster than before...

147
00:08:55,493 --> 00:08:58,996
[UKAI]
(impressed) Okay, next!

148
00:08:59,096 --> 00:09:01,265
First Tempo!

149
00:09:08,772 --> 00:09:10,208
(SHOYO surprised)

150
00:09:10,308 --> 00:09:11,942
[UKAI] You like that, huh.
[SHOYO] So fast!

151
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:13,444
[UKAI]
Think you can block it?

152
00:09:13,544 --> 00:09:15,579
[SHOYO]
I bet I could block
it with some help!

153
00:09:15,679 --> 00:09:16,747
Well probably.

154
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,183
[UKAI]
Of the three tempos
you just saw.

155
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:22,119
Was there a big difference
in how the spiker was
hitting the ball?

156
00:09:22,220 --> 00:09:24,021
[SHOYO]
Um. I don't think so!

157
00:09:24,121 --> 00:09:25,889
[UKAI]
Then, what was the difference?

158
00:09:25,989 --> 00:09:27,258
(SHOYO surprised)

159
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:37,535
[SHOYO]
Something about the approach...
Was it the timing?

160
00:09:37,635 --> 00:09:40,804
[UKAI]
Exactly right! That's what's
called tempo.

161
00:09:40,904 --> 00:09:45,276
[UKAI]
Listen up. The "speed" of an
attack is all controlled by
tempo.

162
00:09:45,376 --> 00:09:47,511
[UKAI]
But it's not about the speed of
the set.

163
00:09:47,611 --> 00:09:52,583
[UKAI]
Rather, it's all about the
timing of when the spiker starts
making his approach.

164
00:09:52,683 --> 00:09:55,819
[UKAI]
So First Tempo is whenever that
timing is the earliest...

165
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:58,889
It will be most effective in
trying to evade enemy blockers.

166
00:09:58,989 --> 00:10:02,660
[UKAI]
You were probably doing that
attack without even thinking
about it.

167
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,964
[UKAI]
But... make sure you fully
understand it.

168
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:10,834
[UKAI]
You make the approach before the
setter even sends the ball...

169
00:10:10,934 --> 00:10:15,005
[UKAI]
and it's the setter's job to
deliver the ball to match the
spiker's position.

170
00:10:15,105 --> 00:10:19,977
[UKAI]
In other words... it's still
an attack in which the spiker
directs the action.

171
00:10:21,144 --> 00:10:23,881
[SHOYO]
That's First... Tempo...

172
00:10:25,316 --> 00:10:26,784
[UKAI]
The point is...

173
00:10:26,884 --> 00:10:29,086
I don't really know
what kind of attack

174
00:10:29,187 --> 00:10:31,021
your deviant quick
attack really is...

175
00:10:31,121 --> 00:10:33,191
[UKAI]
but one thing is for certain:

176
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:38,462
There is no better set in
volleyball than one that is easy
for the spiker to make contact.

177
00:10:45,303 --> 00:10:46,870
(mind‐blown)

178
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:49,773
[KEISHIN] He can't
train just Hinata!
[SHOYO] Huh?

179
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:51,709
[KEISHIN]
Go ahead and practice I'll be
right back!

180
00:10:51,809 --> 00:10:53,076
(ALL confused)

181
00:10:53,177 --> 00:10:55,045
[BOY D]
That guy is a weirdo!

182
00:10:55,145 --> 00:10:57,047
(car starting and peeling away)

183
00:10:57,147 --> 00:11:02,152
[SHOYO]
The timing of when the spikers
start making their approach is
everything...

184
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:09,360
[SHOYO]
One centimeter... one second...
one instant.. to the top.

185
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:12,563
[SHOYO]
But... it takes more than that.

186
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,365
[SHOYO]
See, before this moment,

187
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:17,034
I only had the will to
get up to the summit.

188
00:11:18,101 --> 00:11:19,637
[UKAI]
And from now on...

189
00:11:19,737 --> 00:11:24,575
you wish to keep fighting even
after you've gotten there. Hmmm?

190
00:11:24,675 --> 00:11:27,044
[UKAI]
Well, to do that...
you will need your partner

191
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:29,413
[UKAI] to make some
improvements of his own.
(SHOYO confused)

192
00:11:29,513 --> 00:11:33,217
(KEISHIN revved up yelling)
[UKAI] But I'm sure your coach
will do something about that.

193
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:37,988
[SHOYO]
Kageyama's an amazing player,
so I'm sure he'll make it work.

194
00:11:38,088 --> 00:11:41,859
[UKAI] Hmmm?
[SHOYO] That's why I want to
learn to fight at the summit...

195
00:11:41,959 --> 00:11:46,364
so I won't get left behind...
Can you please teach me?

196
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:51,969
[TORU]
Don't get it twisted...

197
00:11:52,069 --> 00:11:55,606
That quick attack isn't really
yours to control...

198
00:11:55,706 --> 00:11:57,675
It's the Shorty's call.

199
00:11:57,775 --> 00:12:00,344
[TORU]
And if you can't
understand that fact...

200
00:12:00,444 --> 00:12:03,181
you're every bit the despot
King you used to be.

201
00:12:03,281 --> 00:12:04,482
(phone vibrating)

202
00:12:04,582 --> 00:12:07,651
[TOBIO]
Hmm? Uh... hello‐

203
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:09,487
[KEISHIN]
Kageyama! Where are you?!

204
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:11,589
[TOBIO]
(startled) Oh hey Coach...

205
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,424
I was just about to head
to school right now‐

206
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:14,792
[KEISHIN]
What?!

207
00:12:14,892 --> 00:12:16,460
[TOBIO]
I was you know wondering if

208
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:18,529
they were finished inspecting
the gym... (confused)

209
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:20,364
[KEISHIN]
(shock) Kageyama!

210
00:12:20,464 --> 00:12:21,765
[TOBIO]
Whoa!

211
00:12:21,865 --> 00:12:24,902
[KEISHIN]
Don't overshoot!
Just let it drop!

212
00:12:25,002 --> 00:12:26,036
[TOBIO]
What?

213
00:12:26,136 --> 00:12:27,971
[KEISHIN]
(out of breath) A set that
stops!

214
00:12:28,071 --> 00:12:29,573
[TOBIO]
Huh?

215
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:52,396
[UKAI]
Shorty... if you're going to be
able to fight when you make it
to the summit...

216
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:55,966
[UKAI]
then you will need to start
with the basics and build up
from there.

217
00:12:56,066 --> 00:13:00,704
[UKAI]
So, from now on, I want you to
keep doing quick attacks.

218
00:13:00,804 --> 00:13:03,174
[UKAI]
You need to make up for the
technique you're lacking.

219
00:13:03,274 --> 00:13:04,608
[MACHIKO] Hello!
[HIROKI] Hey!

220
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,109
[UKAI]
Oh, you're here.

221
00:13:06,210 --> 00:13:07,711
[SHOYO]
Hello!

222
00:13:07,811 --> 00:13:10,481
[UKAI]
You must Master First Tempo
with everyone.

223
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:13,417
[UKAI] That's your
only task for now.
[SHOYO] Yessir!

224
00:13:13,517 --> 00:13:16,420
[HIROKI] A new guy?
[OGASAWARA] He's in middle‐
[UKAI]
The sets aren't coming

225
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,089
[OGASAWARA] no, wait
he's in high school.
[MACHIKO] Oh yeah?
[UKAI]

226
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,258
[SHOYO]
Okay!

227
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:21,625
[UKAI]
Another thing.

228
00:13:21,725 --> 00:13:23,394
From now on, you
should make it a habit

229
00:13:23,494 --> 00:13:26,364
to touch the ball constantly...
Y'got it, kid?

230
00:13:26,464 --> 00:13:29,600
[SHOYO] Uh‐huh.
[UKAI] With your hand or
your foot, whatever.

231
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,336
[UKAI]
Volleyball is a sport where you
can't hold the ball.

232
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:36,774
[UKAI]
You only touch it for split
seconds. Just for a brief
moment.

233
00:13:36,874 --> 00:13:39,310
[UKAI]
But you must be able to control
that moment...

234
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:42,713
as if the ball was actually
an extension of your own body.

235
00:13:42,813 --> 00:13:47,285
[UKAI]
And your body is small, so
you'll have to make up
for it in other ways.

236
00:13:47,385 --> 00:13:49,019
[SHOYO]
Yessir.

237
00:13:50,388 --> 00:13:53,657
[TOBIO]
Tempo, huh?

238
00:13:53,757 --> 00:13:55,993
[KEISHIN'S MOM]
How can I help you?
[KEISHIN] Well, the whole thing
started out as only a theory,

239
00:13:56,093 --> 00:13:59,463
[KEISHIN]
so I never got a chance to
actually put the idea into
practice.

240
00:13:59,563 --> 00:14:03,334
[KEISHIN]
I was so focused on how special
that quick attack of yours is

241
00:14:03,434 --> 00:14:05,703
that I forgot something
really important.

242
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:10,741
[TOBIO]
I think I understand what
tempo is now... but what's
a set that stops mean?

243
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:14,812
[KEISHIN]
First of all... the way you've
been doing your sets,

244
00:14:14,912 --> 00:14:19,383
[KEISHIN]
they always pass right through
the point of impact in front of
the spiker, see what I mean?

245
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,618
[TOBIO]
Yes.

246
00:14:20,718 --> 00:14:22,686
But I want you to
STOP it right there!

247
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:24,455
You think you can you do that?

248
00:14:24,555 --> 00:14:26,224
(TOBIO very confused)

249
00:14:26,324 --> 00:14:28,859
[KEISHIN]
Okay, basically, what I'm saying
is I want you to make it so

250
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,364
[KEISHIN]
that the spiker's highest impact
point equals the peak of the
ball's trajectory.

251
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:34,865
(TOBIO surprised)

252
00:14:34,965 --> 00:14:36,567
[KEISHIN]
The way it's been going,

253
00:14:36,667 --> 00:14:38,902
the momentum makes it pass
right through that point.

254
00:14:39,002 --> 00:14:40,804
[KEISHIN]
But once it reaches the spiker,

255
00:14:40,904 --> 00:14:43,006
[KEISHIN] I want it to
just hang there.
[TOBIO] ...hang there.

256
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:47,044
[KEISHIN]
(grin) Power control and
reverse spin difficulty

257
00:14:47,144 --> 00:14:49,313
will be nothing like what
you've done until now.

258
00:14:49,413 --> 00:14:52,350
[KEISHIN]
Plus Quick Set B, Quick Set D,
broad jumps...

259
00:14:52,450 --> 00:14:55,986
[KEISHIN]
Ugh... And the difficulty will
increase with distance.

260
00:14:56,086 --> 00:14:58,322
[KEISHIN]
But I bet you can do it, kid.
Whaddya think?

261
00:14:58,422 --> 00:15:02,926
[TORU]
Have you considered why you're
having trouble responding to
Small Fry's requests?

262
00:15:03,026 --> 00:15:05,596
[TOBIO]
Or whether or not you even want
to put in the effort at all?

263
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:09,132
[TOBIO]
I'll give it a shot, Coach.

264
00:15:09,233 --> 00:15:10,701
(KEISHIN satisfied)

265
00:15:13,337 --> 00:15:15,038
[SHOYO] Tanaka!
[RYUNOSUKE] Huh?

266
00:15:15,138 --> 00:15:17,775
[SHOYO]
I‐I'm sorry about
the other night!

267
00:15:17,875 --> 00:15:22,513
[RYUNOSUKE]
Oh yeah... Kageyama groveled to
me earlier... Sorry I decked you
nerds in the face.

268
00:15:22,613 --> 00:15:24,315
[RYUNOSUKE]
Cut it out!

269
00:15:24,415 --> 00:15:26,350
[RYUNOSUKE]
I was so excited to
break up a rumble,

270
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,751
I got kinda carried away!

271
00:15:27,851 --> 00:15:29,953
[SHOYO]
Yeah you have a
nasty punch, Tanaka!

272
00:15:30,053 --> 00:15:32,723
(RYUNOSUKE whistling)
[RYUNOSUKE] True, but you
shouldn't be fighting in front
of girls!

273
00:15:32,823 --> 00:15:34,725
Poor Yachi was scared to death!

274
00:15:34,825 --> 00:15:37,628
[HITOKA]
(distressed sobbing) Ah. Tanaka!
They're gonna kill each other,
hurry hurry!

275
00:15:37,728 --> 00:15:39,263
[RYUNOSUKE]
(confused) Wait who's gonna die?

276
00:15:39,363 --> 00:15:42,032
And you shouldn't fight in front
of the vice principal, either!

277
00:15:42,132 --> 00:15:43,401
Be more careful!

278
00:15:43,501 --> 00:15:44,568
[SHOYO]
Right!

279
00:15:44,668 --> 00:15:46,770
[KEISHIN]
Hey Ginger... Over here.

280
00:15:48,306 --> 00:15:49,573
[KEISHIN]
All right.

281
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:51,375
I want you to be on the
B‐team for a while

282
00:15:51,475 --> 00:15:52,776
when we have mock matches.

283
00:15:52,876 --> 00:15:54,512
[KEISHIN]
Sugawara. He's with you.

284
00:15:54,612 --> 00:15:55,979
[KOSHI]
Uh.. Sure!

285
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,615
[KEISHIN]
Let's get started then.

286
00:15:57,715 --> 00:15:59,116
Make sure to get hydrated!

287
00:15:59,217 --> 00:16:00,651
[ALL]
Yessir.

288
00:16:06,457 --> 00:16:08,125
[HITOKA] Um, Hinata...
[SHOYO] Hmm?

289
00:16:08,226 --> 00:16:11,795
[HITOKA]
I‐I uh... I just wanted
to know if, um...

290
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:15,266
i‐if you and uh...
Kageyama were still...

291
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:18,669
[SHOYO]
(relieved)
Everything's just fine.

292
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:23,841
(HITOKA surprised)
(relieved giggle)

293
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,611
(school bell ringing)

294
00:16:27,711 --> 00:16:31,014
[STUDENT A]
Hey, Yui... Daichi's here.

295
00:16:31,114 --> 00:16:32,350
(YUI startled with food
in her mouth)

296
00:16:32,450 --> 00:16:34,352
[YUI]
(happily leaps) What's up?

297
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,654
[DAICHI]
Hey, do you think we could use
your courts for a bit

298
00:16:36,754 --> 00:16:38,389
after the girls are
done practicing?

299
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:41,359
[DAICHI]
Even uh, maybe if it's right
before the gym closes.

300
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:44,262
[YUI]
Oh.. sure! I'll run
that by the team.

301
00:16:44,362 --> 00:16:46,597
[YUI]
Something wrong
with the second gym?

302
00:16:46,697 --> 00:16:48,166
[DAICHI]
Well, not exactly...

303
00:16:48,266 --> 00:16:50,000
[DAICHI]
We have a couple guys
who need to do

304
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:51,635
a different kind of training,

305
00:16:51,735 --> 00:16:53,737
[DAICHI]
so there's not enough space.

306
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,807
(ASAHI disappointed)

307
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:01,279
[ASAHI]
Serving is the ultimate attack.

308
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,947
[ASAHI]
On the current team,

309
00:17:04,047 --> 00:17:07,017
Kageyama is the only one
whose jump‐serve is stable.

310
00:17:07,117 --> 00:17:10,053
[ASAHI, internal]
Mine's too shaky to use
it when it counts.

311
00:17:10,153 --> 00:17:14,057
[ASAHI]
That means I can't
call it a weapon!

312
00:17:15,426 --> 00:17:17,261
[YU]
Asahiii!

313
00:17:17,361 --> 00:17:18,396
(ASAHI shocked)

314
00:17:21,232 --> 00:17:22,099
[YU]
You got a sec?

315
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:24,235
[ASAHI]
Uh, yeah... of course.

316
00:17:24,335 --> 00:17:27,838
[ASAHI]
He just jumped in and picked up
that serve out of nowhere!

317
00:17:27,938 --> 00:17:30,874
[YU]
I'll send you some... do you
mind hitting a few for me?

318
00:17:30,974 --> 00:17:33,143
[ASAHI]
Uh... okay...

319
00:17:33,244 --> 00:17:37,748
[ASAHI]
Huh? Wait a second...
You're gonna do sets?

320
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:42,786
[ASAHI, internal]
Is he gonna try to do what
that libero on Seijoh did?

321
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:45,889
[YU]
I'll help you with your serving
too, all right?

322
00:17:45,989 --> 00:17:48,592
[ASAHI, internal]
I cannot be left behind...

323
00:17:48,692 --> 00:17:50,194
[ASAHI]
I'm ready when you are.

324
00:17:50,294 --> 00:17:51,762
[YU]
Sweet!

325
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:54,365
[YUI]
Okay boys, it's all yours!

326
00:17:54,465 --> 00:17:56,066
[DAICHI, RYUNOSUKE,
KOSHI, & TOBIO] Thank you!

327
00:17:56,167 --> 00:17:59,303
[KEISHIN]
Yeah, this is the one.

328
00:17:59,403 --> 00:18:01,505
[KOSHI]
So that's the Brazilian national
team's attack?

329
00:18:01,605 --> 00:18:04,041
(RYUNOSUKE amazed)
[KOSHI] They all move
at the same time!

330
00:18:04,141 --> 00:18:07,945
[DAICHI]
Oh yeah, Shinzen also had an
attack like that.

331
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:09,180
[KOSHI]
So it's...

332
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,982
[DAICHI]
It's a synchronized attack...

333
00:18:18,456 --> 00:18:19,623
(HITOKA startled)

334
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:22,860
[TOBIO]
(sigh) Next one, please.

335
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,262
[HITOKA]
Okay!

336
00:18:25,296 --> 00:18:26,364
[SHOYO]
Hey guys!

337
00:18:26,464 --> 00:18:27,565
[OGASAWARA]
Hey, Sho!

338
00:18:27,665 --> 00:18:29,132
[UKAI]
Oh good, you're here, Shorty.

339
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,269
[SHOYO]
Uh listen... Coach Ukai?

340
00:18:31,369 --> 00:18:34,071
I've been meaning to tell
you, my name's not really
Shorty okay...

341
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,839
Not to be rude, but uh...

342
00:18:35,939 --> 00:18:38,376
I'll learn your name when
you earn it with your play.

343
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:39,777
(SHOYO dejected)

344
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,381
[UKAI]
Let's go, Shorty!

345
00:18:43,481 --> 00:18:45,216
[SHOYO]
I'm ready, sir!

346
00:18:48,386 --> 00:18:51,822
[UKAI]
Turn all your attention to
jumping at full strength!

347
00:18:57,928 --> 00:18:59,363
[UKAI]
See, you can do it!

348
00:18:59,463 --> 00:19:01,064
I want you to be able
to handle the ball

349
00:19:01,165 --> 00:19:04,402
regardless of the timing
or who the setter is!

350
00:19:04,502 --> 00:19:05,803
[SHOYO]
Yessir!

351
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,576
[UKAI]
Don't try to match the ball!
Jump at your own timing!

352
00:19:12,676 --> 00:19:16,947
[UKAI]
Fight with your own will, and
not with anyone else's!

353
00:19:18,015 --> 00:19:19,583
[SHOYO]
I'm ready, sir!

354
00:19:24,988 --> 00:19:26,457
[TADASHI]
Hey, Tsukki...

355
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,126
[TADASHI]
I'm gonna going this way...

356
00:19:29,227 --> 00:19:31,929
I'm supposed to practice
my serving with Mr. Shimada.

357
00:19:32,029 --> 00:19:35,065
[KEI]
Oh.. cool... Bye.

358
00:19:38,236 --> 00:19:41,872
♪♪

359
00:20:41,199 --> 00:20:43,934
[MACHIKO]
Oh, sorry! That's too short!

360
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:50,774
[MACHIKO] Wow, that was a
really good cover, Sho!
(SHOYO bashful laugh)

361
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:54,612
[OGASAWARA]
She's right, you used to freak
out if the timing wasn't
perfect!

362
00:20:54,712 --> 00:20:55,779
[SHOYO]
I did not!

363
00:20:55,879 --> 00:20:57,281
Before...

364
00:20:57,381 --> 00:20:59,183
I would always make the shots
without thinking about it,

365
00:20:59,283 --> 00:21:01,219
because I had such
a good setter.

366
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:03,887
But now, since I'm dealing with
a lot of different people's
quirks,

367
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,290
I have to decide in midair.

368
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,461
[SHOYO]
I can see the ball a little
better than I did before.

369
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:13,831
[UKAI] Munchkin... come
give me a hand would ya.
(SHOYO baffled)

370
00:21:13,931 --> 00:21:17,301
[HIROKI]
He moved up from Shorty to
Munchkin! He's promoted!

371
00:21:17,401 --> 00:21:19,303
[OGASAWARA]
That's a promotion?

372
00:21:21,505 --> 00:21:23,040
[UKAI]
You're going back in two days.

373
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,142
(SHOYO surprised)
[UKAI] Along with Nekoma right?

374
00:21:25,243 --> 00:21:29,112
[SHOYO]
Yeah. Our team manager said
Coach Nekomata invited us.

375
00:21:29,213 --> 00:21:33,917
[UKAI]
Agh, well he's a pain in the
ass, but he's got an good eye
for volleyball.

376
00:21:34,017 --> 00:21:40,123
[UKAI]
And the players that he
coaches... cannot be defeated
by any ordinary means, either.

377
00:21:40,224 --> 00:21:43,661
[UKAI]
Now go play until
you're sick of it.

378
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,263
[SHOYO]
Right.

379
00:21:48,966 --> 00:21:49,833
(TAKEDA ecstatic)

380
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:52,069
[TOBIO]
All right!

381
00:21:52,170 --> 00:21:53,136
[TOBIO]
Let's keep going!

382
00:21:53,237 --> 00:21:55,038
[TAKEDA]
(laugh) Sure thing!

383
00:21:58,209 --> 00:22:00,244
[TAKEDA]
Okay! Now that we've started
summer break,

384
00:22:00,344 --> 00:22:02,746
you guys are free to practice
from morning to night!

385
00:22:02,846 --> 00:22:07,218
Tomorrow. we will be going to
another training camp in Tokyo!

386
00:22:09,587 --> 00:22:11,922
[TAKEDA]
This time, we're going
for an entire week!

387
00:22:12,022 --> 00:22:16,327
[TAKEDA]
This will be the first and last
long‐term training camp before
the preliminaries.

388
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,829
[TAKEDA]
The Spring Nationals are just
around the corner!

389
00:22:18,929 --> 00:22:23,133
[TAKEDA]
Use this opportunity to learn
everything you can!

390
00:23:55,393 --> 00:23:57,461
[RYUNOSUKE]
I heard you've been practicing
some sets, Noya.

391
00:23:57,561 --> 00:24:00,231
[YU]
Yeah! So I'm gonna make my
approach from about here...

392
00:24:00,331 --> 00:24:03,667
[YU]
Jumping Thunder Set!
Wait, where's the ball?

393
00:24:03,767 --> 00:24:06,437
[RYUNOSUKE]
Maybe we should start by
practicing a normal one.

394
00:24:06,537 --> 00:24:09,307
[RYUNOSUKE]
Next Haikyu!!
"Moonrise".
