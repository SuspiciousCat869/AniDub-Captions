1
00:00:04,221 --> 00:00:05,389
(SHOYO gasps)

2
00:00:25,409 --> 00:00:26,510
(whistle)

3
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:29,313
(long whistle)

4
00:00:29,413 --> 00:00:33,784
[SHOYO]
There is an enormous wall in
front of me, blocking my way.

5
00:00:39,055 --> 00:00:42,226
[SHOYO]
I can only wonder what's
on the other side?

6
00:00:43,527 --> 00:00:47,030
[SHOYO]
What does it look like...
from the summit?

7
00:00:50,301 --> 00:00:54,838
[SHOYO]
I'll never be able to see over
that wall. Not on my own...

8
00:00:56,173 --> 00:00:57,341
[SHOYO]
But...

9
00:00:59,443 --> 00:01:02,413
[SHOYO]
If I have my teammates
by my side...

10
00:01:05,749 --> 00:01:08,419
[SHOYO]
I just might catch
a glimpse of it.

11
00:02:45,249 --> 00:02:47,551
(call‐outs/
practice drills)

12
00:02:47,651 --> 00:02:49,786
(whistle)
(more call‐outs)

13
00:02:49,886 --> 00:02:50,921
(HISASHI grunt)

14
00:02:51,021 --> 00:02:52,456
[DAICHI & RYUNOSUKE]
Nice receive!

15
00:02:55,692 --> 00:02:56,860
[ASAHI]
Here we go...

16
00:02:59,663 --> 00:03:01,865
[RYUNOSUKE]
I don't think so, buddy!

17
00:03:02,899 --> 00:03:03,900
(CHIKARA dejected)

18
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,002
[RYUNOSUKE]
YEAH!

19
00:03:06,102 --> 00:03:08,739
[SHOYO & RYUNOSUKE]
Booyah! (laughter)

20
00:03:08,839 --> 00:03:09,606
(smug grin)

21
00:03:09,706 --> 00:03:10,541
(TOBIO startled)

22
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:13,444
Uh... booyaaahhh...

23
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,212
[RYUNOSUKE] You'll get there.
(TOBIO startled)

24
00:03:15,312 --> 00:03:17,681
(whistle)
[RYUNOSUKE]
Serve's up, Cap'n!

25
00:03:17,781 --> 00:03:19,115
[YU]
Right here!

26
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,453
[ASAHI]
Bring it left side!

27
00:03:22,553 --> 00:03:26,890
[KOSHI, internal]
Okay. I'll do the high set
that Asahi likes. Here!

28
00:03:36,667 --> 00:03:39,069
[KEISHIN] (impressed) Yeah...
[YU] Chance ball!

29
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:41,272
[CHIKARA]
Leave it to me!

30
00:03:42,873 --> 00:03:44,475
[TOBIO]
Here comes another one!

31
00:03:54,418 --> 00:03:57,354
(whistle)
[KEI] You guys will fall
for anything, won't you?

32
00:03:57,454 --> 00:03:59,556
[TOBIO]
Shut your tall four‐eyed mouth!

33
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,724
[KOSHI]
Whoa, easy!

34
00:04:00,824 --> 00:04:02,025
[KIYOKO]
Hm?

35
00:04:05,629 --> 00:04:06,730
(TADASHI exhales)

36
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:07,698
(whistle)

37
00:04:07,798 --> 00:04:09,132
[KOSHI]
Go for it!

38
00:04:13,136 --> 00:04:15,772
[TADASHI, internal]
(sigh) That could've been
better.

39
00:04:15,872 --> 00:04:17,574
(internal) What's the next move?

40
00:04:20,811 --> 00:04:22,012
(shocked)

41
00:04:22,513 --> 00:04:23,680
(grins)

42
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:28,051
[SHOYO]
Hey, it's that
awesome move of yours!

43
00:04:28,152 --> 00:04:35,292
Uh‐huh! It's Rolling
Thunder... YEAHHH!

44
00:04:35,392 --> 00:04:38,128
(SHOYO & YU pumped‐up)
[RYUNOSUKE] My bad, I was
totally open that time!

45
00:04:38,229 --> 00:04:40,731
[KEI]
There they go.

46
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,467
Okay! Let's start from the top!

47
00:04:43,567 --> 00:04:45,736
[ALL]
Yeah!

48
00:04:45,836 --> 00:04:47,538
Serve it up, Tadashi!

49
00:04:47,638 --> 00:04:48,972
(whistle)

50
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:54,845
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hinata!

51
00:04:54,945 --> 00:04:56,247
[ASAHI, internal]
We gotta block this.

52
00:04:58,749 --> 00:05:00,050
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice cover!

53
00:05:01,117 --> 00:05:02,453
(surprised)

54
00:05:10,194 --> 00:05:13,830
(long whistle)
(TOBIO, SHOYO, RYUNOSUKE,
KAZUHITO, & HISASHI celebrates)

55
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:15,932
[KEISHIN]
Good! Let's call it a day!

56
00:05:16,032 --> 00:05:18,169
Come on, Coach,
just one more set!

57
00:05:18,269 --> 00:05:20,771
[KEISHIN] Huh?
[TOBIO] Yeah, just one!

58
00:05:20,871 --> 00:05:23,174
(sigh) Look, fellas...

59
00:05:23,274 --> 00:05:26,109
constant practice can only
get you so far...

60
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:28,745
Captain, can you talk
some sense into these‐

61
00:05:28,845 --> 00:05:30,281
(RYUNOSUKE grins)

62
00:05:31,348 --> 00:05:33,149
[KEISHIN]
...knuckleheads.

63
00:05:39,323 --> 00:05:41,558
[SHOYO, internal]
I want to play more. More!

64
00:05:41,658 --> 00:05:45,128
[SHOYO]
Hey... You're not tired, right?
Toss me some sets!

65
00:05:45,229 --> 00:05:46,697
[TOBIO] Huh? Sure thing!
[DAICHI] Hm?
(RYUNOSUKE confused)

66
00:05:46,797 --> 00:05:49,099
[RYUNOSUKE]
How the hell do you
have so much energy!?

67
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:51,635
[KEISHIN, internal] They're
getting better every day...
[DAICHI] We gotta wrap it up
guys!

68
00:05:51,735 --> 00:05:53,504
[KEISHIN, internal] but
what we really need
[DAICHI] We still
have to clean the gym!

69
00:05:53,604 --> 00:05:55,439
[KEISHIN] is in‐game experience.
[SHOYO & TOBIO] Yes sir...

70
00:05:55,539 --> 00:05:57,774
[KOSHI] Don't forget you also
need to cool down, okay, guys?

71
00:05:57,874 --> 00:06:00,177
[KEISHIN] We have got to set up
some practice games soon.
[ASAHI] Not so hard! Ah jeez...

72
00:06:00,277 --> 00:06:03,280
[KEISHIN, internal]
But I can't ever get the
Neighborhood Association
together...

73
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:05,081
[TAKEDA]
Hey! Argh! (pain)

74
00:06:05,182 --> 00:06:06,450
(KEISHIN startled)

75
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:07,451
(TAKEDA pained)

76
00:06:07,551 --> 00:06:09,019
[SHOYO] What the‐?!
[RYUNOSUKE] Take?!

77
00:06:09,119 --> 00:06:10,221
[KEISHIN]
Are you alright?

78
00:06:10,321 --> 00:06:11,955
[TAKEDA] We're going!
(ALL startled)

79
00:06:12,055 --> 00:06:13,190
[SHOYO]
Going where?

80
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,991
[TOBIO]
Uhh... You've got a nosebleed!

81
00:06:15,091 --> 00:06:17,394
[TAKEDA]
(determined) Tokyo!

82
00:06:17,494 --> 00:06:18,162
(ALL shock)

83
00:06:18,262 --> 00:06:19,563
[SHOYO]
Tokyo, Tokyo?

84
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:20,731
[TAKEDA]
Mm‐hm!

85
00:06:20,831 --> 00:06:22,399
So that means we...

86
00:06:22,499 --> 00:06:24,501
we get to...?!

87
00:06:24,601 --> 00:06:27,804
(baseball practice)

88
00:06:29,072 --> 00:06:31,208
[SHOYO] We get to play Nekoma?!
(KENMA sneezes)

89
00:06:31,308 --> 00:06:32,709
[KUROO] Hm? (surprised)
[YAMAMOTO] Gross, dude!

90
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:34,378
[YAKU]
Use a tissue!

91
00:06:34,478 --> 00:06:36,513
(SHOYO excited gasp)
[TOBIO] We've got
a practice match?

92
00:06:36,613 --> 00:06:40,551
[TAKEDA]
Mhm. But this time around
we won't just be playing
against Nekoma.

93
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,919
(SHOYO & TOBIO question)

94
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:45,922
[TAKEDA]
Nekoma is part of the
Fukurodani Academy Group.

95
00:06:46,022 --> 00:06:49,226
They're an association of
schools from around the
Kanto region,

96
00:06:49,326 --> 00:06:52,062
who hold practice games with
each other all the time.

97
00:06:52,163 --> 00:06:56,733
[TAKEDA]
So, get this... Thanks to
Coach Nekomata... we get
to participate too!

98
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:59,836
[TAKEDA]
Now we've got some other people
to practice with!

99
00:06:59,936 --> 00:07:01,137
(RYUNOSUKE & YU excited)

100
00:07:01,238 --> 00:07:02,639
Most of the time,
groups like that

101
00:07:02,739 --> 00:07:04,775
are built on long‐standing
relationships

102
00:07:04,875 --> 00:07:06,577
that take years to establish...

103
00:07:06,677 --> 00:07:10,113
So it's hard to get in without
having some kind of special
connection...

104
00:07:10,214 --> 00:07:12,383
We should thank Coach Nekomata
for the favor.

105
00:07:12,483 --> 00:07:16,620
[KEISHIN]
You boys should say thanks to
Takeda too; I'm sure he had to
ask him a million times.

106
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,991
[TAKEDA]
Ah! It was nothing! It helped to
mention the old Coach Ukai‐

107
00:07:21,091 --> 00:07:22,693
[ALL] Thank you!
(TAKEDA startled)

108
00:07:24,195 --> 00:07:25,762
(TAKEDA happy sigh)

109
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,332
[TAKEDA]
In the past few years...

110
00:07:28,432 --> 00:07:29,833
we've sort of drifted apart from

111
00:07:29,933 --> 00:07:33,537
many of the schools we used
to have a good rapport with.

112
00:07:33,637 --> 00:07:36,573
[TAKEDA]
And a lot of the coaches old
Coach Ukai was friends with...

113
00:07:36,673 --> 00:07:40,244
well they've mostly
transferred... or just retired.

114
00:07:40,344 --> 00:07:43,547
So this is our chance!
Now let's make the most of it!

115
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:45,282
[ALL]
Yeah!

116
00:07:47,784 --> 00:07:50,821
[TOBIO]
And that set of theirs... I will
figure it out this time!

117
00:07:50,921 --> 00:07:52,223
(SHOYO shocked)

118
00:07:52,323 --> 00:07:54,124
[KENMA]
(shiver) Ah..

119
00:07:54,225 --> 00:07:56,026
I think I'm starting
to catch cold...

120
00:07:56,126 --> 00:07:59,563
[KENMA] I feel a chill.
[YAMAMOTO] Huh? Oh no!
Not 'til AFTER the tournament!

121
00:07:59,663 --> 00:08:02,933
[YU]
Let's go make Karasuno
High proud okay!

122
00:08:03,033 --> 00:08:06,370
[YAKU]
(shivering) That's weird; it's
kinda cold out today, huh?

123
00:08:06,470 --> 00:08:08,004
[YAMAMOTO]
Not Yaku too?!

124
00:08:08,104 --> 00:08:09,540
[RYUNOSUKE]
(excited yell)

125
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:12,276
Hope you're ready, city boys;
you've got it comin' now!

126
00:08:12,376 --> 00:08:13,610
[KEI]
God, you are so stupid.

127
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,078
[TADASHI]
Please stop saying that...

128
00:08:15,179 --> 00:08:16,880
Man, I can't wait to kick
some ass!

129
00:08:16,980 --> 00:08:18,148
I'm on fire!

130
00:08:18,249 --> 00:08:20,617
[KUROO]
Alright settle down, Yamamoto.

131
00:08:25,989 --> 00:08:29,693
[SHOYO]
I'll get through their wall...
I know I will!

132
00:08:30,361 --> 00:08:31,628
(TOBIO determined)

133
00:08:31,728 --> 00:08:33,597
[TAKEDA]
Starting this weekend,
they'll be busy

134
00:08:33,697 --> 00:08:36,300
playing in preliminary matches
for their Inter‐High tournament,

135
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,302
so it won't be
happening right away.

136
00:08:38,402 --> 00:08:40,537
We're invited, but we still have
to get school permission

137
00:08:40,637 --> 00:08:42,939
and the finer details
to work through...

138
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:47,811
[TAKEDA]
There is a good amount of
red tape to be dealt with. But
we'll talk about that later.

139
00:08:47,911 --> 00:08:50,214
[TAKEDA]
I just wanted to confirm
that you wanted to go.

140
00:08:50,314 --> 00:08:51,215
[DAICHI]
'Course we do!

141
00:08:51,315 --> 00:08:52,949
[ALL]
Let's do this!

142
00:08:53,049 --> 00:08:55,919
(smile) Ah! Oh, yeah!

143
00:08:56,019 --> 00:08:59,656
[TAKEDA]
I've a faculty meeting
to go to, so I'll leave
it to you for now...

144
00:08:59,756 --> 00:09:01,992
You can take care of all
the volleyball stuff, Coach.

145
00:09:02,092 --> 00:09:03,927
[KEISHIN] Sure thing.
[ALL] Thank you!
(TAKEDA startled)

146
00:09:04,027 --> 00:09:06,830
[ASAHI] We're about to
be pretty busy guys.
[DAICHI] Uh‐huh.

147
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:11,268
[KOSHI]
An away game, huh... It's your
first one, isn't it?

148
00:09:11,368 --> 00:09:14,771
[KIYOKO]
Mm‐hm. So I'll do my best too.

149
00:09:14,871 --> 00:09:16,773
(confused)
(eager)

150
00:09:18,008 --> 00:09:20,277
[KEISHIN]
Let's get this place
cleaned up and go home!

151
00:09:20,377 --> 00:09:22,213
[ALL]
Yes sir!

152
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:30,187
[SHOYO]
Now that really hit
the spot! (burp)

153
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,455
[STUDENT A]
Dude, who's that girl?

154
00:09:31,555 --> 00:09:33,123
[STUDENT B]
She must be a third‐year.

155
00:09:33,224 --> 00:09:35,292
[GIRL A]
Pretty!

156
00:09:35,392 --> 00:09:37,394
[SHOYO]
What's going on over here?

157
00:09:42,933 --> 00:09:45,169
[SHOYO]
(shock) It's Kiyoko!

158
00:09:45,269 --> 00:09:46,570
[KIYOKO]
Huh?

159
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:48,205
[STUDENT A]
Huh?! Hinata,

160
00:09:48,305 --> 00:09:49,740
do you really know
this hottie?!

161
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:52,676
Wh‐wh‐what are you
doing... uh.. here?

162
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:55,045
[KIYOKO] Hinata... Hey there.
[SHOYO] Gah!

163
00:09:55,145 --> 00:09:59,650
[KIYOKO]
I was wondering if you happen to
know any first‐years who haven't
joined a club yet.

164
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:01,585
(confused)

165
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:06,223
(RYUNOSUKE angry yelling)

166
00:10:06,323 --> 00:10:08,159
(RYUNOSUKE annoyed breath)

167
00:10:08,259 --> 00:10:12,263
[RYUNOSUKE]
"Monthly Volleyball" did an
article about that butt‐weasel
Oikawa!

168
00:10:12,363 --> 00:10:14,265
[SHOYO] Woah!
(TOBIO annoyed sigh)

169
00:10:14,365 --> 00:10:16,267
[KOSHI]
I'm not surprised;

170
00:10:16,367 --> 00:10:19,770
he's really talented...
Well, what does it say?

171
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:21,872
[RYUNOSUKE]
Uhhh... Let's see here...

172
00:10:21,972 --> 00:10:24,908
[RYUNOSUKE]
"Toru Oikawa's favorite food is
milk bread...

173
00:10:25,008 --> 00:10:29,346
His personal motto is,
'if you're going to hit it,
then hit it 'til it breaks'"?!

174
00:10:29,446 --> 00:10:30,747
(RYUNOSUKE annoyed)

175
00:10:30,847 --> 00:10:32,649
[KOSHI]
That's what the story's about?
(startled)

176
00:10:32,749 --> 00:10:35,219
[YU]
Yeah, yeah, who gives a crap
about corny stuff like that?!

177
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:38,389
[RYUNOSUKE]
Huh? Listen to this... Even
though they're about to
graduate,

178
00:10:38,489 --> 00:10:41,758
[RYUNOSUKE]
looks like almost all of
Seijoh's third‐years are
staying on the team...

179
00:10:41,858 --> 00:10:43,894
to try and get revenge
on Shiratorizawa.

180
00:10:43,994 --> 00:10:46,397
[RYUNOSUKE]
That's cute and all, but it's
not enough to beat me!

181
00:10:46,497 --> 00:10:48,365
[SHOYO]
OR MEEEE!

182
00:10:48,465 --> 00:10:50,667
[KOSHI]
Stop! You're gonna tear it up!

183
00:10:51,202 --> 00:10:52,736
Good grief...

184
00:10:52,836 --> 00:10:55,372
Hm? Ushiwaka?

185
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,242
[SHOYO]
(surprised) Japan!?

186
00:10:58,342 --> 00:11:01,645
[DAICHI]
Hey! Come on outside guys;
it's time to run some laps.

187
00:11:01,745 --> 00:11:04,781
[KOSHI]
Daichi... Ushiwaka made
the World Youth Team!

188
00:11:04,881 --> 00:11:07,384
(ASAHI gasp)
[DAICHI] Huh?!
[TADASHI] World Youth Team?

189
00:11:07,484 --> 00:11:10,887
[KEI]
He represents Japan on a team of
the world's best young players.

190
00:11:10,987 --> 00:11:15,192
Only one school can represent
Miyagi Prefecture at the Spring
Nationals...

191
00:11:15,292 --> 00:11:17,461
and if we want that
school to be us...

192
00:11:17,561 --> 00:11:22,266
[DAICHI]
We have to take down
Oikawa and Ushiwaka.

193
00:11:22,366 --> 00:11:26,537
(determined)

194
00:11:26,637 --> 00:11:28,705
(aggressive exhale)

195
00:11:28,805 --> 00:11:31,408
[DAICHI]
Alright then...
Let's get to wooork!

196
00:11:31,508 --> 00:11:33,410
[ALL]
Yeah!

197
00:11:39,115 --> 00:11:40,951
(TAKEDA nervous breathing)

198
00:11:46,223 --> 00:11:47,824
(TAKEDA sighs)

199
00:11:47,924 --> 00:11:50,327
[TAKEDA, internal]
This is reality, Takeda.

200
00:11:50,427 --> 00:11:52,829
Just accept it and
don't lose your head.

201
00:11:52,929 --> 00:11:59,002
[TAKEDA, internal]
These kids have spirit; they'll
be just fine. They can do it if
they try, right?

202
00:11:59,102 --> 00:12:01,805
(TAKEDA uncertain whimper)

203
00:12:01,905 --> 00:12:04,575
[TAKEDA, incoherent mutterings]
They can do it they can do it
they can do it they can do it
they can do it...

204
00:12:04,675 --> 00:12:07,578
[TEACHER]
Huh? Oh my gosh. Are you okay?

205
00:12:15,286 --> 00:12:18,622
[RYUNOSUKE]
Here we are... at Karasuno's
infamous Heartbreak Hill.

206
00:12:18,722 --> 00:12:24,595
Now! I want 10 uphill dashes to
the midpoint! We're going up in
pairs! Ready...

207
00:12:30,033 --> 00:12:31,468
[DAICHI]
Ready...

208
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:36,507
[DAICHI]
Hey give it your best,
Tsukishima! Ready...

209
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:38,509
(clap) (KOSHI & ASAHI running)

210
00:12:41,312 --> 00:12:42,379
[DAICHI]
Ready...

211
00:12:42,479 --> 00:12:44,481
(clap)
(HISASHI & KAZUHITO grunt)

212
00:12:45,616 --> 00:12:46,450
[DAICHI]
Ready...

213
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:49,286
(determined)

214
00:12:49,386 --> 00:12:56,327
(power yell, into panting)

215
00:12:56,427 --> 00:12:58,595
(stunned)

216
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,832
(RYUNOSUKE, CHIKARA, & TADASHI
exhausted panting)

217
00:13:03,334 --> 00:13:04,601
[CHIKARA]
(pant) You did it, Tsukishima.

218
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:06,770
(TOBIO & SHOYO power‐yelling)
[CHIKARA] Huh?

219
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,244
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hey birdbrains, you do know
that's the wrong way, don'tcha?!

220
00:13:13,344 --> 00:13:16,112
[KEI]
I'd say probably not... Oh well.

221
00:13:16,213 --> 00:13:18,081
(TOBIO & SHOYO yelling)

222
00:13:32,796 --> 00:13:34,931
[SHOYO] Huh?
[TOBIO] Hm?

223
00:13:36,099 --> 00:13:38,635
[CROW]
Birdbrains, birdbrains,
birdbrains...

224
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:42,839
(TOBIO panting)
[SHOYO] Hey wait... what
happened to the rest of the
team, huh? (panting)

225
00:13:42,939 --> 00:13:45,209
[SHOYO]
Aw, you got us lost out here
didn't you, Kageyama?

226
00:13:45,309 --> 00:13:47,043
[TOBIO]
(annoyed) You mean you did!

227
00:13:47,143 --> 00:13:48,312
(SHOYO & TOBIO growling)

228
00:13:48,412 --> 00:13:51,548
[SHOYO]
Huh? Where are we?

229
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,017
[SHOYO]
Wakano District 3?

230
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:57,721
[TOBIO]
So we're in Wakano, huh?
Shiratorizawa's not too far.

231
00:13:57,821 --> 00:14:00,224
[SHOYO]
Hey, isn't that the school
where Ushiwaka goes?

232
00:14:00,324 --> 00:14:02,226
[USHIWAKA]
Someone say my name?

233
00:14:11,768 --> 00:14:13,837
[SHOYO]
Whoa, it's you!

234
00:14:29,486 --> 00:14:31,488
[SHOYO]
You're... that guy!

235
00:14:31,588 --> 00:14:33,990
(TOBIO & SHOYO gawking)

236
00:14:37,428 --> 00:14:39,029
[USHIWAKA]
Yeah, I'd better go. See ya.

237
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:42,098
[TOBIO]
(gasp) We're from the
Karasuno volleyball team!

238
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:45,336
And we want to go to your
school and spy on you!

239
00:14:45,436 --> 00:14:47,204
[SHOYO, internal]
Gah! Is he crazy?!

240
00:14:47,304 --> 00:14:50,574
You can't TELL people
you're gonna spy on 'em!

241
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:52,709
[USHIWAKA]
Karasuno...

242
00:14:52,809 --> 00:14:55,412
You're the team with that
lightning‐fast quick attack.

243
00:14:55,512 --> 00:14:58,148
(TOBIO & SHOYO startled)

244
00:14:58,249 --> 00:15:01,852
[USHIWAKA]
Do what you want. Letting you
watch won't change anything.

245
00:15:01,952 --> 00:15:06,223
[USHIWAKA]
It won't make you any better
and it certainly won't make
our team worse.

246
00:15:08,492 --> 00:15:12,863
[USHIWAKA]
Feel free to come take
a look. I'll even let you
follow me back.

247
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,831
If you can keep up that is.

248
00:15:14,931 --> 00:15:16,533
(TOBIO & SHOYO startled)

249
00:15:16,633 --> 00:15:18,134
[TOBIO]
Yeah, let's go...

250
00:15:18,235 --> 00:15:20,271
I'd like a peek at the team
we'll be defeating at Nationals.

251
00:15:20,371 --> 00:15:24,508
[SHOYO]
Mhmm. Are you out here
running by yourself?

252
00:15:24,608 --> 00:15:28,612
[USHIWAKA]
The rest of the team is out too.
They're just lagging behind.

253
00:15:28,712 --> 00:15:30,481
[SHOYO]
Huh?

254
00:15:30,581 --> 00:15:33,584
[SHOYO]
Ah! Kageyama!
You got a head start!

255
00:15:33,684 --> 00:15:35,919
[TOBIO]
Yeah, not my fault you're slow!

256
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:44,195
[TOBIO, internal]
I knew he'd be a fast runner.
(surprised)

257
00:15:44,295 --> 00:15:46,963
[SHOYO]
Oh boy, I can't wait to see
Shiratorizawa!

258
00:15:47,063 --> 00:15:51,001
[TOBIO]
Ahh! Would you please shut up?!
You're like a little puppy out
for his first walk!

259
00:15:51,101 --> 00:15:54,205
[TOBIO] Shut up! Shut up!
(SHOYO laughing merrily)

260
00:15:58,542 --> 00:16:02,078
[SHOYO]
Whoaaa... It's huge!

261
00:16:03,079 --> 00:16:04,681
[SHOYO]
Check out the main building!

262
00:16:04,781 --> 00:16:06,283
It looks like a fancy hotel!

263
00:16:06,383 --> 00:16:08,919
[SHOYO]
And look how gigantic this
athletic field is!

264
00:16:09,019 --> 00:16:15,091
[SHOYO]
Wow! There's so much stuff, they
need sign‐posts! Kageyama,
horses! There's horses!

265
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,228
[SHOYO]
Huh! They have a bus just for
volleyball!

266
00:16:17,328 --> 00:16:19,563
[TOBIO]
You better not get us lost in
here too, Hinata.

267
00:16:19,663 --> 00:16:20,697
[SHOYO]
Whatever Dad!

268
00:16:20,797 --> 00:16:21,965
[TOBIO]
Wait, where's Ushiwaka?!

269
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:24,701
[SHOYO]
Omigod, I think we are lost!

270
00:16:24,801 --> 00:16:29,005
(SHOYO & TOBIO heavy breathing)

271
00:16:29,105 --> 00:16:32,509
[SHOYO]
I think this is the gym for
volleyball club.

272
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,944
[TOBIO]
Yeah.

273
00:16:42,018 --> 00:16:44,955
[SHOYO]
Hey! Is he in there? Move over!
Lemme see! Let me see!

274
00:16:45,055 --> 00:16:47,258
[TOBIO]
Ugh! Don't push me!

275
00:16:48,359 --> 00:16:49,760
(game chatter)

276
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:52,263
[SHOYO]
Hey look. There's another
high school here...

277
00:16:52,363 --> 00:16:55,098
Are they in the middle
of a practice match?

278
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:57,601
[TOBIO]
That's a... college team.

279
00:16:57,701 --> 00:16:58,869
[SHOYO]
College team?!

280
00:16:58,969 --> 00:17:00,437
[TOBIO]
Yeah, they are THAT good...

281
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,772
None of the high
schools in the area

282
00:17:01,872 --> 00:17:03,707
are good enough to
challenge them...

283
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:05,376
To get their practice...

284
00:17:05,476 --> 00:17:08,412
they have to travel or
play college teams, dummy.

285
00:17:08,512 --> 00:17:11,114
[SHOYO]
Well excuse me...

286
00:17:11,215 --> 00:17:12,949
[USHIWAKA] Took you a while.
(TOBIO & SHOYO startled)

287
00:17:13,049 --> 00:17:15,219
[TOBIO]
My name is Tobio Kageyama
from Karasuno...

288
00:17:15,319 --> 00:17:17,288
Would you mind if we
watch you guys play?

289
00:17:17,388 --> 00:17:21,024
[USHIWAKA]
Kageyama huh...
From Kitagawa First?

290
00:17:21,124 --> 00:17:24,728
[TOBIO]
(surprised) Yeah...
I applied here but...

291
00:17:24,828 --> 00:17:27,264
[USHIWAKA] No surprise.
(TOBIO & SHOYO startled)

292
00:17:27,364 --> 00:17:31,134
[USHIWAKA]
I saw you play once when you
were in middle school...

293
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:34,838
What good is a setter who
won't devote himself to
his team's ace?

294
00:17:34,938 --> 00:17:36,973
(TOBIO serious) (question)
(SHOYO cracking up)

295
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:40,711
[SHOYO] He's right; you're
not really the "devoted"
type, Kageyama!
[TOBIO] Hey!

296
00:17:40,811 --> 00:17:44,215
[SHOYO]
But the "Great King" is like the
best setter in the whole
prefecture...

297
00:17:44,315 --> 00:17:46,250
and HE'S not a devoted
type of guy either.

298
00:17:46,350 --> 00:17:48,919
[TOBIO]
Nngh! What does this have to do
with Oikawa, you turd licker?!

299
00:17:49,019 --> 00:17:55,759
Oikawa... I wish he would have
come here with us... He is an
excellent player.

300
00:17:55,859 --> 00:17:57,494
(SHOYO gasp)

301
00:17:57,594 --> 00:17:58,795
Well you're the ace here...

302
00:17:58,895 --> 00:18:00,464
so that means he'd
be devoted to YOU.

303
00:18:00,564 --> 00:18:04,067
[USHIWAKA]
Regardless of where he is
or who he's playing with,

304
00:18:04,168 --> 00:18:06,770
Oikawa can bring out the
best in his entire team...

305
00:18:06,870 --> 00:18:13,143
[USHIWAKA]
A weak team will become a
powerful one... And a stronger
team will become unstoppable.

306
00:18:13,244 --> 00:18:15,379
[USHIWAKA]
That's Oikawa's talent.

307
00:18:15,479 --> 00:18:20,784
Even the most healthy sapling is
only as strong as the soil in
which it grows...

308
00:18:20,884 --> 00:18:24,888
If the soil is barren,
it will never bear any fruit.

309
00:18:24,988 --> 00:18:28,259
[SHOYO]
Barren soil?
What does that mean?

310
00:18:29,693 --> 00:18:31,195
Outside of Oikawa...

311
00:18:31,295 --> 00:18:35,031
Aoba‐Johsai's weak...
That's all there is to it.

312
00:18:35,866 --> 00:18:37,501
[SHOYO]
Think so, huh?

313
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:47,110
[SHOYO]
Well, if you think Seijoh is
barren soil...

314
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:50,814
then I guess that makes us a
concrete parking lot doesn't it?

315
00:18:50,914 --> 00:18:52,283
(USHIWAKA surprised)

316
00:18:58,489 --> 00:19:04,761
[TOBIO, internal]
What's with him? Normally he'd
be shaking in his shoes in front
of a guy like that.

317
00:19:04,861 --> 00:19:06,930
[USHIWAKA]
Sorry if this offends you...

318
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:11,468
[USHIWAKA]
But I don't have time for a team
that couldn't beat Aoba‐Johsai
in the prelims...

319
00:19:11,568 --> 00:19:15,005
[USHIWAKA]
You can talk all you want,
but I'm not listening.

320
00:19:25,316 --> 00:19:26,883
(USHIWAKA shocked)

321
00:19:38,595 --> 00:19:42,499
[SHOYO]
I'm Shoyo Hinata, from the
Kurasuno parking lot.

322
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:51,242
[SHOYO]
And I'm going to nationals.
After I kick your ass.

323
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:20,637
[JANITOR]
Hey you two... What do you think
you're doing here, you can't be
here without permission!

324
00:20:20,737 --> 00:20:26,943
[SHOYO]
Anyway... Thank you for showing
us around the school... See ya.

325
00:20:27,043 --> 00:20:32,249
[TOBIO]
Look. If Oikawa is supposedly
the best setter in the
prefecture...

326
00:20:32,349 --> 00:20:36,052
I will be even better...
Just watch me.

327
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:39,956
(TOBIO grunts)

328
00:20:45,296 --> 00:20:52,068
[USHIWAKA]
Stamina, speed, swiftness,
Jumping‐power, AND spirit...

329
00:20:53,270 --> 00:20:59,543
[USHIWAKA]
Shoyo Hinata...
And Tobio Kageyama.

330
00:20:59,643 --> 00:21:01,111
(snickers)

331
00:21:08,018 --> 00:21:10,020
[TOBIO]
That was some big talk.

332
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,289
We're not even good enough to
defeat Aoba‐Johsai yet,

333
00:21:12,389 --> 00:21:14,791
and much less
Shiratorizawa y'know.

334
00:21:14,891 --> 00:21:17,361
[SHOYO]
We just need to beat ONE team.

335
00:21:17,461 --> 00:21:19,163
[TOBIO]
Well, for starters, yeah.

336
00:21:19,263 --> 00:21:21,165
[SHOYO]
That's why we're
going to Tokyo...

337
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:26,270
If we want to get stronger,
then we need to play as many
tough teams as we can!

338
00:21:35,812 --> 00:21:40,784
[TAKEDA]
(awkward throat clear)
So, about that trip to Tokyo...

339
00:21:40,884 --> 00:21:45,222
[TAKEDA]
We're planning to do it next
month. It'll be here before you
know it.

340
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:47,658
[TAKEDA]
We need your parents' permission
for this kind of thing,

341
00:21:47,758 --> 00:21:50,427
so I'll be sending you all
home with the paperwork...

342
00:21:50,527 --> 00:21:54,665
[TAKEDA]
Luckily, the school's already
given the go‐ahead to make the
trip during the school week.

343
00:21:54,765 --> 00:21:58,034
(ALL happy)
[TAKEDA] Although...
It'll be tricky.

344
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:02,773
(SHOYO serious)
[TAKEDA] Final exams are
also next month... You do
know that, don't you?

345
00:22:02,873 --> 00:22:03,607
(KEISHIN shocked)

346
00:22:03,707 --> 00:22:05,309
(silence)

347
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,444
[TAKEDA]
Don't you?

348
00:22:08,612 --> 00:22:11,848
[TAKEDA]
I'm sure you can guess
what I'm about to say.

349
00:22:11,948 --> 00:22:14,618
[TAKEDA] If you fail
in even one subject...
(YU & RYUNOSUKE quivering)

350
00:22:14,718 --> 00:22:17,087
[TAKEDA]
You'll have extra
lessons on weekends.
(TOBIO nervous quivering)

351
00:22:17,188 --> 00:22:19,390
(SHOYO quivering)

352
00:22:19,490 --> 00:22:23,394
[TAKEDA]
And of course Tokyo...
You'll be out.

353
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:57,654
[SHOYO] What happens if
we miss the exam?
[TADASHI] Makeup exam?

354
00:23:57,754 --> 00:23:59,723
[SHOYO] But what if
you miss the makeup?
[TADASHI] Makeup‐makeup?

355
00:23:59,823 --> 00:24:01,958
[SHOYO]
Then let's just keep pretending
we're sick until after the trip!

356
00:24:02,058 --> 00:24:04,695
[KEI]
If you fake being sick, you
can't go on the trip either.

357
00:24:04,795 --> 00:24:06,062
(SHOYO horrified)

358
00:24:06,163 --> 00:24:09,433
[KEI]
Sorry... Next Haikyu!!
"Direct Sunlight."
