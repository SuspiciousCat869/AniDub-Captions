1
00:00:07,146 --> 00:00:08,848
Hey, are we winning?!

2
00:00:08,948 --> 00:00:10,349
Don't push me!

3
00:00:10,449 --> 00:00:12,852
[Sasaya]:
Look at that...
We're behind.

4
00:00:12,952 --> 00:00:16,188
Ugh... Well, it is only
two points, right?

5
00:00:16,288 --> 00:00:20,492
It's the second set. Who knows?
Maybe we took the first one.

6
00:00:20,593 --> 00:00:22,695
[Daichi]:
Uh...

7
00:00:22,795 --> 00:00:25,464
Aoba‐Johsai won the
first set, actually.

8
00:00:25,565 --> 00:00:26,666
Huh?! You guys!

9
00:00:26,766 --> 00:00:30,136
Uh... hey,
there... hey...

10
00:00:30,236 --> 00:00:31,203
How're you doin'?

11
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:32,905
Been a while.

12
00:00:33,472 --> 00:00:34,774
Hey guys!

13
00:00:34,874 --> 00:00:35,407
Hey!

14
00:00:35,508 --> 00:00:37,476
Hey!

15
00:00:37,577 --> 00:00:40,146
Karasuno's third‐years
are still here, huh?

16
00:00:40,246 --> 00:00:41,514
Yeah.

17
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,717
Well.. let's see how OUR
new lineup's holding up.

18
00:00:45,952 --> 00:00:47,019
Makki!

19
00:00:49,789 --> 00:00:51,457
[Ryunosuke]:
Sweet!

20
00:00:51,558 --> 00:00:53,693
Damn, that guy's got
a pretty good eye.

21
00:00:53,793 --> 00:00:56,963
Way to go, Takahiro!
Keep it up Takahiro!

22
00:00:57,063 --> 00:00:59,699
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Let's go, get another point!

23
00:01:00,533 --> 00:01:04,604
Oooooooolé

24
00:01:05,204 --> 00:01:06,438
[Obara]:
Sorry!

25
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:08,074
Got it!

26
00:01:08,174 --> 00:01:10,877
Looks like Date Tech's
setter is some new guy.

27
00:01:10,977 --> 00:01:12,278
Yeah...

28
00:01:12,378 --> 00:01:13,713
[Tobio]:
I wonder what‐

29
00:01:14,346 --> 00:01:15,414
Whoa!

30
00:01:15,515 --> 00:01:17,483
Did you see what
he just did?!

31
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,514
[Futakuchi]:
Coming your way!

32
00:02:54,614 --> 00:02:56,215
Got it!

33
00:02:56,315 --> 00:02:57,884
Yeah, let's go!

34
00:02:57,984 --> 00:03:00,553
Kogane still moves around
the court like an amateur.

35
00:03:00,653 --> 00:03:02,955
Eh... as long as
the ball goes up, right?

36
00:03:03,055 --> 00:03:03,990
Left side!

37
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:04,991
Right!

38
00:03:07,026 --> 00:03:07,727
Whoa!

39
00:03:07,827 --> 00:03:09,095
What's with that set?!

40
00:03:09,195 --> 00:03:10,797
[Koganegawa]:
It's up to you, Futakuchi!

41
00:03:10,897 --> 00:03:12,464
[Obara]:
C'mon, man! You got this!

42
00:03:12,565 --> 00:03:13,933
[Futakuchi]:
That's too far up there!

43
00:03:14,033 --> 00:03:16,268
I'm not good with ones
that are up too high!

44
00:03:18,571 --> 00:03:20,673
[Team Seijoh]:
(cheering)

45
00:03:23,342 --> 00:03:24,511
Agh... sorry!

46
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,046
Don't worry
about it, Futakuchi!

47
00:03:27,146 --> 00:03:29,849
Hey... Send it a
little lower next time!

48
00:03:29,949 --> 00:03:32,284
Sure! As low
as you want!

49
00:03:32,384 --> 00:03:33,586
But not too
low, okay?!

50
00:03:33,686 --> 00:03:35,354
Like somewhere in the
middle or something!

51
00:03:35,454 --> 00:03:36,823
Yeah! Cool!

52
00:03:36,923 --> 00:03:38,658
[Futakuchi]:
Are you sure
you understand?

53
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,860
[Koganegawa]:
Uhh... yep!

54
00:03:42,494 --> 00:03:46,165
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

55
00:03:46,265 --> 00:03:47,399
Well, that
sucked.

56
00:03:47,499 --> 00:03:49,235
It's okay! Just
shake it off.

57
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:52,238
I think Date Tech's setter's
a first‐year, isn't he?

58
00:03:52,338 --> 00:03:53,540
Their Number 7.

59
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,807
Yeah...

60
00:03:58,344 --> 00:04:00,179
[Asahi]:
He's big, huh?

61
00:04:00,279 --> 00:04:02,048
Yeah, he's huge.

62
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,717
Take a look at
our new weapon.

63
00:04:06,853 --> 00:04:11,123
[Moniwa]:
The big‐boned
setter, Koganegawa.

64
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:12,258
Big‐boned...?

65
00:04:12,358 --> 00:04:13,693
Setter...?

66
00:04:27,239 --> 00:04:28,440
Uh, nice catch, sir!

67
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:32,444
I'm so very sorry!
I'll do 100 laps right now!

68
00:04:32,545 --> 00:04:34,881
No, just work
on your stupid sets!

69
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:37,016
H‐he's still in the
process of developing!

70
00:04:37,116 --> 00:04:38,618
He hasn't been a
setter very long!

71
00:04:38,718 --> 00:04:40,486
But he's gonna be a
big name before you know it!

72
00:04:40,587 --> 00:04:44,123
Th‐those kind of mistakes
happen to everybody...

73
00:04:44,223 --> 00:04:47,359
[Kamasaki]:
Why is he trying to
justify it with Karasuno?

74
00:04:49,762 --> 00:04:51,598
[Hajime]:
Serve's up!

75
00:04:51,698 --> 00:04:53,800
I used to be kind
of a clown once,

76
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:55,735
so I bet I was probably
a lot of trouble

77
00:04:55,835 --> 00:04:57,637
for my
upperclassmen, too.

78
00:04:57,737 --> 00:04:59,071
C'mon, let's go!

79
00:04:59,171 --> 00:05:01,307
[Futakuchi]:
But you can't be
too serious, either...

80
00:05:01,407 --> 00:05:05,244
What we got here, is a
failure to communicate.

81
00:05:05,344 --> 00:05:07,614
You got that right!

82
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:09,716
[Hajime]:
Matsukawa's up!

83
00:05:09,816 --> 00:05:12,652
We can't let them
get any more of a lead!

84
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,854
Come on guys, cut it off!

85
00:05:14,954 --> 00:05:16,556
[Futakuchi]:
Left!

86
00:05:16,656 --> 00:05:17,990
A setter dump...

87
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:20,159
It's above the block,
but... it's too obvious!

88
00:05:23,429 --> 00:05:24,531
What?!

89
00:05:24,631 --> 00:05:25,932
Dammit!

90
00:05:26,032 --> 00:05:27,433
[Yutaro]:
There's our chance!
Iwa!

91
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,002
Good one, Sakunami!

92
00:05:30,102 --> 00:05:31,971
All right, it's
comin' your way!

93
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:35,742
Got it! Makki!

94
00:05:35,842 --> 00:05:37,243
I'm on it!

95
00:05:37,343 --> 00:05:40,179
Is the wing spiker
really about to do a set?!

96
00:05:44,316 --> 00:05:45,552
Oikawa!

97
00:05:45,652 --> 00:05:47,119
[Yutaro]:
Oikawa!

98
00:06:14,847 --> 00:06:15,882
It's fine.

99
00:06:15,982 --> 00:06:17,884
[Onagawa]:
Kogane, nice block!

100
00:06:19,552 --> 00:06:21,888
Dude, I said the
middle alright!

101
00:06:21,988 --> 00:06:23,189
Okay, I'm sorry!

102
00:06:23,289 --> 00:06:25,124
I really am! Are you
going to be okay?

103
00:06:25,224 --> 00:06:28,260
Of course I'm not, that's why
I'm telling you to fix it!

104
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:31,263
It's my fault for
letting you guys down.

105
00:06:31,831 --> 00:06:32,799
Don't blame him.

106
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:34,066
[Koganegawa]:
Thanks!

107
00:06:35,802 --> 00:06:38,304
Our new Iron Wall.

108
00:06:39,972 --> 00:06:43,510
[Moniwa]:
First‐year phenom, Koganegawa.

109
00:06:45,477 --> 00:06:46,378
A new...

110
00:06:46,478 --> 00:06:49,481
...Iron Wall!

111
00:06:49,582 --> 00:06:53,285
[Sasaya]:
Well, it sounds cooler than
"big‐boned setter," I guess.

112
00:06:53,385 --> 00:06:56,088
So they're going to be
a thorn in our side as well.

113
00:06:56,188 --> 00:06:58,357
Kinda refreshing,
actually.

114
00:06:58,457 --> 00:06:59,291
It's true.

115
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:01,127
Nobody asked you.

116
00:07:01,861 --> 00:07:05,064
Now... what to do...?

117
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:07,433
[Obara]:
Nice receive!

118
00:07:07,534 --> 00:07:10,236
Leave it to me!

119
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,838
Got it!

120
00:07:12,739 --> 00:07:14,106
Kindaichi!

121
00:07:15,742 --> 00:07:16,776
A counter!

122
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,878
Nothing less
from them.

123
00:07:18,978 --> 00:07:20,613
There you go again;
that was way too obvious!

124
00:07:20,713 --> 00:07:24,817
I'm sorry! I just think setter
dumps look really awesome!

125
00:07:24,917 --> 00:07:27,554
I guess that's
a good reason...

126
00:07:29,522 --> 00:07:31,758
You do know you don't
have to do a fakeout

127
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,359
every single
time though, right?

128
00:07:33,459 --> 00:07:36,763
Hm? Uh...

129
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:38,931
[Hajime]:
Get it over!

130
00:07:39,031 --> 00:07:41,133
[Yutaro]:
Let's go, Oikawa!

131
00:07:44,136 --> 00:07:48,007
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

132
00:07:49,075 --> 00:07:52,879
[Team Seijoh/Seijoh Crowd]:
(cheering)

133
00:07:52,979 --> 00:07:54,881
Not a surprise, but
it seems like Seijoh

134
00:07:54,981 --> 00:07:56,849
kinda has the upper
hand, here.

135
00:07:56,949 --> 00:07:58,818
Yeah, but Date Tech's
putting up the best fight

136
00:07:58,918 --> 00:08:00,720
they can manage,
though.

137
00:08:00,820 --> 00:08:03,656
[Koshi]:
That big‐boned setter of theirs
is a good weapon in some ways,

138
00:08:03,756 --> 00:08:05,992
but he has his weaknesses.

139
00:08:06,092 --> 00:08:10,062
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

140
00:08:12,932 --> 00:08:14,100
Crap!

141
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,401
[Hajime]:
It's an overpass!

142
00:08:15,502 --> 00:08:16,536
Chance ball! Got it!

143
00:08:16,636 --> 00:08:17,970
[Obara]:
Here comes another quick!

144
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:18,971
[Yutaro]:
Center!

145
00:08:19,071 --> 00:08:20,206
[Hajime]:
Left!

146
00:08:20,306 --> 00:08:22,241
[Onagawa]:
Number 12! Number 12!

147
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:24,977
[Oiwake]:
Listen. As a setter,
Koganegawa's has absolutely

148
00:08:25,077 --> 00:08:27,179
no real game experience.

149
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:31,017
So what I need you to do,
Sakunami, is to guide him along.

150
00:08:31,117 --> 00:08:32,619
Can you do that?

151
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:36,288
To help Koganegawa become
a great player...

152
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,660
...I should receive!

153
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:42,562
Yeah!

154
00:08:42,662 --> 00:08:44,463
[Oiwake]:
Try this... I need you to get
the receives high enough

155
00:08:44,564 --> 00:08:46,766
for Koganegawa
to do a jumping set...

156
00:08:46,866 --> 00:08:49,669
And it's fine if it's
near the net...

157
00:08:49,769 --> 00:08:54,741
I mean, after all... he's got
the reach. He'll get there.

158
00:08:54,841 --> 00:08:56,475
So don't worry...

159
00:08:56,576 --> 00:08:58,310
you don't have to try doing
anything all that difficult yet.

160
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,380
Start the ball high,
and keep it there.

161
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:04,050
[Sakunami]:
Just leave it in the air!

162
00:09:09,188 --> 00:09:13,526
Whoaaah! So fast! And high!

163
00:09:13,626 --> 00:09:17,029
He really did just leave the
ball at the point of impact.

164
00:09:17,129 --> 00:09:19,699
A combo like that's only
possible with a setter

165
00:09:19,799 --> 00:09:21,267
who can get that far up.

166
00:09:25,237 --> 00:09:28,307
We've got a setter using
his height as a weapon.

167
00:09:28,407 --> 00:09:32,278
A big‐boned setter...
Well that's interesting.

168
00:09:51,263 --> 00:09:55,868
[Moniwa]:
We can catch up! This is where
you guys need to get a block!

169
00:09:55,968 --> 00:09:57,604
[Koganegawa]:
You're up, Jingo!

170
00:09:58,605 --> 00:09:59,806
I got it!

171
00:09:59,906 --> 00:10:01,240
Nice receive!

172
00:10:06,478 --> 00:10:09,816
[Team Seijoh]:
(cheering)

173
00:10:09,916 --> 00:10:11,584
A setter dump!
And here I thought

174
00:10:11,684 --> 00:10:14,320
Oikawa was keeping
a low profile today...

175
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:16,455
He's a pretty
cool cat, isn't he?

176
00:10:16,556 --> 00:10:17,624
Pain in the ass.

177
00:10:17,724 --> 00:10:20,492
[Daichi]:
Seijoh's at match point, now.

178
00:10:20,593 --> 00:10:29,168
[Seijoh crowd]:
One more point! One more point!

179
00:10:29,268 --> 00:10:32,939
Now, calm down!
Let's just get a point, okay!

180
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:34,473
Yeah!

181
00:10:35,675 --> 00:10:37,409
[Hajime]:
It's you, Hanamaki!

182
00:10:37,510 --> 00:10:41,681
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé

183
00:10:41,781 --> 00:10:45,685
Asahi... Is it me, or did these
guys up their serving game?

184
00:10:45,785 --> 00:10:47,019
Yeah...

185
00:10:47,119 --> 00:10:47,987
Over here!

186
00:10:48,087 --> 00:10:48,921
Futakuchi!

187
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:50,022
Got it!

188
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:51,423
[Obara]:
It's all you!

189
00:10:54,026 --> 00:10:55,895
Aw... yeaaaah!

190
00:10:55,995 --> 00:10:57,329
All right!

191
00:10:57,429 --> 00:10:59,331
Yeah! Those are our
underclassmen, punks!

192
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:02,569
And don't you forget it!

193
00:11:02,669 --> 00:11:06,405
That was killer!
[Toru]:
And now that first‐year
setter is in the front row...

194
00:11:06,506 --> 00:11:10,176
Hey Onagawa!
Serve's up!

195
00:11:10,276 --> 00:11:12,679
Futakuchi's an ace
who's good at blocking.

196
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:15,882
Aone is the core of the
Iron Wall, of course.

197
00:11:15,982 --> 00:11:19,085
And then there's
Koganegawa...

198
00:11:19,185 --> 00:11:23,255
[Moniwa]:
Right now, this "Triple Wall"
of ours is the strongest

199
00:11:23,355 --> 00:11:25,324
in the whole prefecture!

200
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,459
[Futakuchi]:
Let's go!

201
00:11:30,196 --> 00:11:31,764
Sorry, that's short!

202
00:11:33,966 --> 00:11:34,901
Iwa!

203
00:11:35,001 --> 00:11:36,168
Yeah!

204
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,939
[Futakuchi]:
It's yours!
[Aone]:
One‐touch!

205
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,874
Got it! Kogane!

206
00:11:41,974 --> 00:11:44,410
Okay!

207
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,312
[Futakuchi]:
You do know you don't
have to do a fakeout

208
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:48,781
every single time,
though, right?

209
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:50,583
I... don't?

210
00:11:52,418 --> 00:11:54,486
Let's just slam it down.

211
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,561
Whoa... the dude went after
a strong shot this time!

212
00:12:01,661 --> 00:12:04,130
Nobody could've
picked that one up.

213
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:06,232
All right,
it's a break!

214
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:08,434
Yeahhh! Let's
get another one!

215
00:12:09,636 --> 00:12:10,436
Okay, guys.

216
00:12:10,537 --> 00:12:12,338
Hey.

217
00:12:12,438 --> 00:12:16,776
Do what you always do...
Let me handle this guy.

218
00:12:19,646 --> 00:12:20,947
Roger...

219
00:12:21,047 --> 00:12:23,816
It looks like Oikawa sent the
ball further away from the net

220
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,819
so it wouldn't be so easily
caught by the blockers.

221
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,022
Yeah, and it looks like Iwaizumi
didn't take too kindly to that.

222
00:12:30,122 --> 00:12:31,390
Did he?

223
00:12:31,490 --> 00:12:33,626
Well, that does make
it more difficult to hit.

224
00:12:34,861 --> 00:12:36,228
One more point...

225
00:12:37,196 --> 00:12:38,497
[Futakuchi]:
You're up!

226
00:12:39,632 --> 00:12:40,667
Got it!

227
00:12:42,869 --> 00:12:48,474
[Nametsu]:
Incredible receive, Saku!
But is it gonna clear the net?!

228
00:12:56,783 --> 00:12:57,884
Stop it!

229
00:12:57,984 --> 00:12:59,385
Come on!

230
00:13:04,924 --> 00:13:06,092
Iwa!

231
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:08,628
I got it!

232
00:13:08,728 --> 00:13:13,032
[Koganegawa]:
I am "basically a baby"
as a setter.

233
00:13:13,132 --> 00:13:16,235
If there's anything I have just
as much of as my upperclassmen

234
00:13:16,335 --> 00:13:17,904
right now...

235
00:13:19,438 --> 00:13:21,240
it's my height!

236
00:13:24,544 --> 00:13:26,713
[Iron Wall]:
It will not end here!

237
00:13:32,018 --> 00:13:34,754
We won't let it!

238
00:13:34,854 --> 00:13:39,325
You can't fake
experience... first‐year!

239
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:57,276
[Shoyo]:
He... He shot right
between his arms!

240
00:13:57,376 --> 00:14:00,580
(final whistle)
(cheering)

241
00:14:02,114 --> 00:14:04,283
Hey, man! That
was so badass!

242
00:14:04,383 --> 00:14:06,252
Great job,
Iwaizumi! Yeah!

243
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:08,387
Nice kill!

244
00:14:08,487 --> 00:14:11,490
Well I guess that
takes care of that.

245
00:14:11,591 --> 00:14:15,361
Oh, man, he just went head‐on
with that triple block.

246
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:18,030
Smooth move, I'll
give him that much.

247
00:14:29,241 --> 00:14:31,811
(whistle)

248
00:14:31,911 --> 00:14:34,380
[Team Date Tech/Team Seijoh]:
Thank you for the game!

249
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:36,115
(applause)

250
00:14:36,215 --> 00:14:38,117
Well, there you have it...

251
00:14:38,217 --> 00:14:40,587
[Daichi]:
Our next opponent.

252
00:14:45,925 --> 00:14:47,393
Let's line up.

253
00:14:47,493 --> 00:14:50,630
What was that Futakuchi!
What the hell, man?!

254
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:58,671
[Kamasaki]:
You still suck at
volleyball, Kogane!

255
00:14:58,771 --> 00:15:00,006
I'm sorry!

256
00:15:00,106 --> 00:15:02,575
The new captain really had
his back to the wall, too...

257
00:15:02,675 --> 00:15:04,577
You owe Moniwa
a thank‐you.

258
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,846
Yeah, yeah, tell me
something I don't know.

259
00:15:06,946 --> 00:15:11,584
Alright, fine... There's
plenty of room to grow!

260
00:15:11,684 --> 00:15:14,887
Yeah, but with emphasis
on the word "plenty."

261
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:21,994
Listen up... you just gotta
do your best. I mean it, guys.

262
00:15:22,094 --> 00:15:25,798
[Moniwa]:
You can be the best
Iron Wall we've ever had.

263
00:15:27,299 --> 00:15:29,869
[Futakuchi]:
Well okay... let's go then.

264
00:15:30,236 --> 00:15:31,838
Hm?

265
00:15:31,938 --> 00:15:33,840
If you guys had anything going
on in your pathetic lives,

266
00:15:33,940 --> 00:15:36,543
you wouldn't have come all
the way out here, would you?

267
00:15:36,643 --> 00:15:38,811
[Futakuchi]:
Come practice with us.

268
00:15:38,911 --> 00:15:39,979
Huh?

269
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:42,515
Well, then, twist my arm!

270
00:15:42,615 --> 00:15:43,950
Please don't take
off your clothes.

271
00:15:44,050 --> 00:15:45,618
[Futakuchi]:
Kamasaki... You
haven't gained

272
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:47,720
too much muscle
to jump, have you?

273
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,789
[Kamasaki]:
Huh? Why?

274
00:15:49,889 --> 00:15:51,423
[Futakuchi]:
Muscle's heavy, dude.

275
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:52,992
[Kamasaki]:
Oh yeah, guess so.

276
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:54,561
I...

277
00:15:54,661 --> 00:15:57,496
I swear, I'll be able
to toss any ball one day!

278
00:15:57,597 --> 00:15:59,165
And I'll block too!

279
00:15:59,265 --> 00:16:01,467
I'll do the Iron Wall
name proud!

280
00:16:01,568 --> 00:16:04,604
I will stop anybody!
No matter how strong!

281
00:16:04,704 --> 00:16:06,906
[Koganegawa]:
No matter how tall they are!

282
00:16:11,611 --> 00:16:13,580
[Aone]:
The opponent who's
difficult to beat

283
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,016
won't necessarily be someone
who's big and strong.

284
00:16:26,125 --> 00:16:30,262
Shoyo Hinata. I won't
forget this day.

285
00:16:30,362 --> 00:16:32,799
[Aone]:
I'll stop you next time.

286
00:17:41,668 --> 00:17:46,205
(final whistle)
(applause)

287
00:17:58,851 --> 00:18:01,688
Uh... seems like
they're on edge...

288
00:18:01,788 --> 00:18:03,656
So wrong with them?

289
00:18:03,756 --> 00:18:06,358
Last time... they gave
everything they had

290
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:08,027
when they played Aoba‐Johsai.

291
00:18:08,127 --> 00:18:10,730
[Kiyoko]:
But... they still lost.

292
00:18:10,830 --> 00:18:12,464
[Hitoka]:
Oh...

293
00:18:12,565 --> 00:18:13,900
Uh... Yachi?

294
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,034
Yes?

295
00:18:16,035 --> 00:18:17,770
Do you maybe
have some antacids?

296
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:20,540
Are you okay, Tadashi?!

297
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:23,409
Sorry. I'm getting
a bit nervous...

298
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,979
Well, if there's one thing in
this world I'm confident about,

299
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,180
it's being nervous!

300
00:18:28,280 --> 00:18:30,382
Huh? How does... that work?

301
00:18:30,482 --> 00:18:33,653
Well, it's always better to put
how nervous you are into words.

302
00:18:33,753 --> 00:18:35,221
Instead of holding it in,
you should freak out

303
00:18:35,321 --> 00:18:37,256
like "Oh my gosh,
what am I gonna do?!"

304
00:18:37,356 --> 00:18:39,225
I know it sounds weird,
but it really helps you

305
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:40,793
get the
jitters out!

306
00:18:40,893 --> 00:18:43,129
I feel like my nerves put my
life in danger all the time,

307
00:18:43,229 --> 00:18:46,065
so I looked up a bunch of tricks
and stuff to help with it!

308
00:18:46,165 --> 00:18:47,266
Did you
say "danger"?

309
00:18:47,366 --> 00:18:49,301
Yeah like exams
and gym class.

310
00:18:49,401 --> 00:18:51,070
Um... exams...?

311
00:18:53,105 --> 00:18:53,940
I, uh...

312
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,375
Mm‐Hm...?

313
00:18:56,475 --> 00:19:00,747
Back at the Inter‐High prelims,
during the Seijoh match...

314
00:19:00,847 --> 00:19:05,084
[Tadashi]:
they subbed me in for the
first time, as a pinch server.

315
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:09,455
It was a close game.

316
00:19:09,556 --> 00:19:11,991
If I'd landed it,
we might've won.

317
00:19:19,265 --> 00:19:21,033
But I wasted
that serve...

318
00:19:21,133 --> 00:19:25,371
And when I get to thinking about
how that could happen again...

319
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:28,107
[Hitoka]:
What...?

320
00:19:28,207 --> 00:19:31,944
They made you take on
all that responsibility?!

321
00:19:32,545 --> 00:19:34,013
Yachi?!

322
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:37,784
I'm so nervous! My heart's
gonna jump out of my mouth!

323
00:19:37,884 --> 00:19:40,553
No, it's okay! Maybe
YOU need the antacids!

324
00:19:40,653 --> 00:19:43,189
Or a defibrillator!
I‐I dunno!

325
00:19:43,289 --> 00:19:44,557
What's wrong?

326
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:46,526
Yachi's gonna die!
And it's my fault!

327
00:19:46,626 --> 00:19:47,660
Easy, buddy!

328
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:48,828
Call the cops!

329
00:19:48,928 --> 00:19:51,363
Uh don't you
mean an ambulance?

330
00:19:51,463 --> 00:19:52,999
He was really
nervous...

331
00:19:53,099 --> 00:19:55,802
and then he transferred all that
nervous energy on to Yachi...

332
00:19:55,902 --> 00:19:58,270
Just like passing
on a virus.

333
00:19:58,370 --> 00:20:01,140
Yeah, I guess it's sort of
somethin' like that!

334
00:20:03,910 --> 00:20:07,179
Oh, looks like somebody's
in super panic mode.

335
00:20:09,215 --> 00:20:10,650
Yeah.

336
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:13,586
[Tobio]:
Oikawa's really strong.

337
00:20:13,686 --> 00:20:16,656
So it's all about the
Great King again, isn't it?

338
00:20:16,756 --> 00:20:18,090
Yeah, I understand...

339
00:20:18,190 --> 00:20:20,627
But I thought you were
excited about playing him.

340
00:20:20,727 --> 00:20:23,229
[Tobio]:
When you're scared,
you're scared.

341
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:27,767
"A team of six
is stronger than one."

342
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:29,468
[Hinata]:
Huh?

343
00:20:29,569 --> 00:20:34,240
[Tobio]:
A while back, I heard
Iwaizumi say that to Oikawa.

344
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:38,177
[Hajime]:
At the end of the day, the best
team of six WINS, dumbass!

345
00:20:38,277 --> 00:20:43,449
[Tobio]:
At the time, I thought "Why is
he saying something so obvious?"

346
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:46,018
Like, if there are six strong
members make on a team,

347
00:20:46,118 --> 00:20:49,722
of course that team
would be strong, right?

348
00:20:49,822 --> 00:20:53,459
[Tobio]:
But now, I finally understand
what he was really saying.

349
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:56,596
It's not about just having
a team of strong members.

350
00:20:56,696 --> 00:20:58,598
It's when they
all work together,

351
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,700
their strengths
multiply.

352
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:02,869
And no matter
what team he joins,

353
00:21:02,969 --> 00:21:06,906
Oikawa always seems to draw out
the best in each spiker...

354
00:21:08,007 --> 00:21:09,909
...better than I can.

355
00:21:11,978 --> 00:21:16,215
You think so, huh?
Well, even if he can...

356
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:21,087
Then we'll just have
to be... the exception!

357
00:21:24,957 --> 00:21:27,827
[Daichi]:
Okay! Is everybody here?

358
00:21:28,795 --> 00:21:30,863
It's almost time.

359
00:21:40,840 --> 00:21:43,009
Okay, let's go!

360
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:45,411
Yeah!

361
00:23:49,936 --> 00:23:51,871
Now we'll get
our revenge.

362
00:23:51,971 --> 00:23:55,007
Yes we will.

363
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,109
[Koganegawa]:
One more cutlet
bowl, please!

364
00:23:57,209 --> 00:23:58,878
[Futakuchi]:
You're eating too much.
That's your fourth one!

365
00:23:58,978 --> 00:24:00,847
[Koganegawa]:
If I'm gonna be the
best Iron Wall I can be,

366
00:24:00,947 --> 00:24:03,082
I need to bulk up!
I'm aiming for 6 foot!

367
00:24:03,182 --> 00:24:06,018
[Futakuchi]:
Uh why don't you bulk
up your skills first!

368
00:24:06,118 --> 00:24:09,188
Next Haikyu!!
"Wiping Away"
