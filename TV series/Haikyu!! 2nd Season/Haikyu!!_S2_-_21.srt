1
00:00:21,252 --> 00:00:23,154
It's out...?

2
00:00:23,254 --> 00:00:28,259
We did it... We took
the first set from Seijoh!

3
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:30,061
We took the first set!

4
00:00:30,161 --> 00:00:31,428
Yeah!

5
00:00:31,528 --> 00:00:34,131
C'mon, guys!
Take the second one too!

6
00:00:34,231 --> 00:00:35,499
Sorry about that.

7
00:00:35,599 --> 00:00:37,834
That was clearly
a ball for Kindaichi!

8
00:00:37,935 --> 00:00:39,603
Not only did he rob
him of the ball,

9
00:00:39,703 --> 00:00:41,305
but he knocked
it out of bounds?!

10
00:00:41,405 --> 00:00:43,307
On top of that,
we were at set point!

11
00:00:43,407 --> 00:00:46,710
Where do I even start
discussing this with him?!

12
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:49,913
That was
really dangerous!

13
00:00:50,014 --> 00:00:51,248
Iwaizumi!

14
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:54,051
Right, right! That! Yes!
That needs to be said first!

15
00:00:54,151 --> 00:00:56,787
Uh... I'm okay,
don't worry about me...

16
00:00:56,887 --> 00:00:58,755
It's been a while since
I've been in a game,

17
00:00:58,855 --> 00:01:00,824
so I wanted to
get involved early.

18
00:01:00,924 --> 00:01:02,593
That's still no reason
to do that, y'know!

19
00:01:02,693 --> 00:01:04,328
What's up
with that guy?

20
00:01:04,428 --> 00:01:07,664
Subbing in someone like that...
What's wrong with Seijoh?

21
00:01:12,436 --> 00:01:17,408
Hey, that guy from before...
He's in the starting lineup now!

22
00:01:17,508 --> 00:01:19,410
If they're subbing him
in for Kunimi...

23
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:22,846
then I bet he's gonna be pretty
quick on his feet... Watch out.

24
00:01:22,947 --> 00:01:24,348
Look, you can do
what you want...

25
00:01:24,448 --> 00:01:26,250
but if I find you're
dragging us down,

26
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:28,885
then I'm gonna
have you subbed out.

27
00:01:28,986 --> 00:01:32,456
Just don't start screwing things
up, or you're back on the bench.

28
00:01:32,556 --> 00:01:33,724
Yessir.

29
00:01:33,824 --> 00:01:35,426
Hey, I just told you
the exact same thing!

30
00:01:35,526 --> 00:01:39,130
That guy... He challenged
Iwaizumi every chance he could.

31
00:01:39,230 --> 00:01:41,198
and lost each and every
time he fought him.

32
00:01:41,298 --> 00:01:43,935
Iwaizumi's the only one
he always listens to.

33
00:01:44,035 --> 00:01:46,170
Like he's
the alpha dog.

34
00:01:46,270 --> 00:01:49,073
[Yahaba]:
Yeah. It'd be better if
he'd answer to Oikawa though.

35
00:01:49,173 --> 00:01:51,375
[Kentaro]:
True. He is the team
leader, after all.

36
00:01:51,475 --> 00:01:54,378
Listen, guys, if we keep
this good energy going...

37
00:01:54,478 --> 00:01:56,480
the second set's all ours!

38
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:58,215
Yeah!

39
00:03:34,946 --> 00:03:37,848
[Yu]:
Serve us up
a good one, Asahi!

40
00:03:41,918 --> 00:03:43,054
[Watari]:
It's out!

41
00:03:43,955 --> 00:03:45,856
Ah! Dammit! I'm sorry!

42
00:03:45,957 --> 00:03:47,458
[Koshi]:
We'll get the next one!

43
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:49,293
[Chikara]:
Shake it off!
[Daichi]:
Don't cry!

44
00:03:49,393 --> 00:03:50,461
What'd you say?!

45
00:03:50,561 --> 00:03:52,363
[Matsukawa]:
Go for it, Oikawa!

46
00:03:54,665 --> 00:03:56,100
It's out!

47
00:03:58,035 --> 00:03:59,236
Sorry!

48
00:03:59,336 --> 00:04:00,571
[Hajime]:
Let it go!

49
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:02,773
What is wrong
with Oikawa today?

50
00:04:02,873 --> 00:04:04,508
He just missed
another one.

51
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:06,177
Did you see how
fast that was?

52
00:04:06,277 --> 00:04:09,981
If that hit me,
I would have lost a limb!

53
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,916
I think his aim is
slowly getting better.

54
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:17,721
[Ryunosuke]:
Kill it, Tsukishima!

55
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:22,159
[Toru]:
Nice cover, Iwa!

56
00:04:22,259 --> 00:04:24,728
All right, which of these
three is it gonna be?

57
00:04:24,828 --> 00:04:25,829
Mad Dog, it's yours!

58
00:04:25,929 --> 00:04:27,965
An open set to the right?!

59
00:04:28,065 --> 00:04:33,270
"Mad Dog"? Is that really his
nickname? That's so awesome!

60
00:04:33,370 --> 00:04:35,572
C'mon, guys!
Hang on...
What's he doing?

61
00:04:35,672 --> 00:04:38,842
[Shimada]:
Look where he's
approaching the net.

62
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,012
[Hajime]:
Triple block!

63
00:04:47,952 --> 00:04:50,654
[Takinoue]:
Whoa, that was a crazy cut shot!

64
00:04:50,754 --> 00:04:51,755
[Matsukawa]:
Nice kill!

65
00:04:51,855 --> 00:04:53,557
That's why he did
it that way!

66
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:55,092
Huh?

67
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,927
[Shimada]:
When you end up
facing the blockers...

68
00:04:57,028 --> 00:04:58,862
you have a few options
for which course to hit.

69
00:04:58,963 --> 00:05:00,431
Of course, it makes
it easier for you

70
00:05:00,531 --> 00:05:03,267
to land square against
the block, right?

71
00:05:03,367 --> 00:05:05,902
But he hit that ball
as if he was slicing it

72
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:07,538
from the side of the blockers.

73
00:05:07,638 --> 00:05:09,974
Hitting with his right hand
from the right side allows

74
00:05:10,074 --> 00:05:12,076
for a crazy‐strong cut shot.

75
00:05:12,176 --> 00:05:14,245
[Saeko]:
How cool!

76
00:05:14,345 --> 00:05:16,213
Mad Dog is so rad!

77
00:05:18,315 --> 00:05:20,484
[Hanamaki]:
Iwaizumi's serve!

78
00:05:23,754 --> 00:05:25,656
It's coming back!
Chance ball!

79
00:05:25,756 --> 00:05:27,591
Damn, that's my fault!

80
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:29,026
Those two serving back‐to‐back

81
00:05:29,126 --> 00:05:31,295
is putting a lot of
pressure on us...

82
00:05:31,395 --> 00:05:34,765
And on top of that,
this "Mad Dog" kid...

83
00:05:35,499 --> 00:05:38,069
Oh... a double
quick‐attack?

84
00:05:45,242 --> 00:05:48,812
Don't disappear on me, even Mad
Dog won't bite too many times.

85
00:05:48,912 --> 00:05:51,215
Keep on coming
after it, 'kay?

86
00:05:51,315 --> 00:05:53,550
Shorty caught on that
you weren't the one

87
00:05:53,650 --> 00:05:54,918
hitting, Kendaichi.

88
00:05:55,019 --> 00:05:58,055
A‐ah, yeah sorry!
Guess I sorta chickened out!

89
00:05:58,155 --> 00:05:59,523
[Toru]:
Iwa, let's get
another one!

90
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:01,725
[Hajime]:
You got this!

91
00:06:01,825 --> 00:06:03,160
Kageyama!

92
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:06,297
Yeah!

93
00:06:06,397 --> 00:06:07,664
Well done, nice receive!

94
00:06:07,764 --> 00:06:09,333
A C‐Quick!

95
00:06:14,905 --> 00:06:16,373
A‐are you all right?

96
00:06:16,473 --> 00:06:17,874
Y‐yeah... I'm good.

97
00:06:17,975 --> 00:06:23,214
It's that Number 16 again!
That's three points in a row!

98
00:06:24,615 --> 00:06:28,785
They're landing them, but the
combo plays look a bit sporadic.

99
00:06:28,885 --> 00:06:30,454
Ever since 16 subbed in,

100
00:06:30,554 --> 00:06:33,490
the rhythm of their
attacks has changed.

101
00:06:33,590 --> 00:06:35,792
[Hanamaki]:
Kyotani, nice kill.

102
00:06:35,892 --> 00:06:38,162
Serve up a point,
Iwaizumi!

103
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,100
Sorry!

104
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,569
We finally got
a point back.

105
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,943
[Toru]:
Makki, nice!

106
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:54,345
Not so fast!

107
00:06:54,445 --> 00:06:55,980
And now...!

108
00:06:58,182 --> 00:07:01,318
After some flashy
moves from 16...

109
00:07:01,418 --> 00:07:03,988
[Tobio]:
a broad jump
from Kindaichi!

110
00:07:06,257 --> 00:07:08,459
Yeah!

111
00:07:08,559 --> 00:07:10,394
Hmm? Look at him,

112
00:07:10,494 --> 00:07:13,664
he's ticked off that he's
being used as a decoy.

113
00:07:13,764 --> 00:07:15,799
Although that
obsession to attacking

114
00:07:15,899 --> 00:07:18,802
is raising his
effectiveness as a decoy.

115
00:07:18,902 --> 00:07:23,040
How 'bout we make those fangs
of yours even sharper.

116
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:25,609
Let's lock this down...

117
00:07:25,709 --> 00:07:29,580
This team now... is not
the same Seijoh we know.

118
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,348
[Watari]:
Kindaichi's up!

119
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:34,118
Got it!

120
00:07:34,218 --> 00:07:35,319
[Ryunosuke]:
Left!

121
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:37,854
[Shoyo]:
Center!

122
00:07:37,955 --> 00:07:40,958
So they decided to always
have one mid‐blocker glued

123
00:07:41,058 --> 00:07:42,126
to Hinata.

124
00:07:42,226 --> 00:07:43,727
[Toru]:
It's up! Cover it!

125
00:07:43,827 --> 00:07:46,063
Got it! Kyotani, to you!
Sorry, it's close to the net!

126
00:07:46,163 --> 00:07:47,764
[Toru]:
Triple block!

127
00:07:47,864 --> 00:07:49,500
If he hits, he'll be stuffed!

128
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,135
Mad Dog, bring it back!

129
00:07:55,106 --> 00:07:57,141
That was a great block!

130
00:07:57,241 --> 00:08:01,912
Gotta say, that was a pretty
brave full swing he did there...

131
00:08:02,013 --> 00:08:04,115
What're you doing?!
Why didn't you try a fakeout

132
00:08:04,215 --> 00:08:05,649
or a lob or something?!

133
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:08,185
A spike doesn't feel as good
if it doesn't crush somebody

134
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:10,054
and land for the kill!

135
00:08:13,057 --> 00:08:14,091
Get it together!

136
00:08:14,191 --> 00:08:15,726
[Irihata]:
Now, now, Mizoguchi.

137
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:19,363
Everything will work itself out
when the time comes, okay?

138
00:08:19,463 --> 00:08:20,631
Uhh... right.

139
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:23,600
So, uh... who's quick
on their feet again?

140
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:25,302
I just said he might be!

141
00:08:25,402 --> 00:08:27,939
Oh, so he doesn't like
doing fakeouts, does he?

142
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:30,074
Well that guy's
missing out!

143
00:08:30,975 --> 00:08:32,243
[Toru]:
Makki!

144
00:08:33,477 --> 00:08:35,379
[Daichi]:
Nice, Nishinoya!

145
00:08:38,782 --> 00:08:41,652
Nicely done,
Makki! Mad Dog!

146
00:08:41,752 --> 00:08:44,321
[Saeko]:
It's that shot he hits
from the side again!

147
00:08:44,421 --> 00:08:46,690
This time I'll
stop him for sure!

148
00:08:51,695 --> 00:08:52,929
We've been saved...

149
00:08:53,030 --> 00:08:55,032
They were going up
against a triple block...

150
00:08:55,132 --> 00:08:57,468
and they decided to go
at it with a hard hit...

151
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,437
A move like that doesn't
come without its risks.

152
00:09:00,537 --> 00:09:04,208
That kid's unpredictable
and marches to his own drum.

153
00:09:04,308 --> 00:09:07,044
Seeing as how he hasn't been
in any other match before...

154
00:09:07,144 --> 00:09:11,115
[Keishin]:
Number 16 must be a
double‐edged sword for them.

155
00:09:11,815 --> 00:09:14,251
That spike from Number 16...

156
00:09:14,351 --> 00:09:17,989
It's like "WHOOSH" and "ZOOM,"
and it looks totally awesome!

157
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:20,757
I know, right? Doesn't it?

158
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:24,128
[Toru]:
What Mad Dog has, on top of
the obvious jumping skills,

159
00:09:24,228 --> 00:09:27,364
is extraordinary back
and abdominal strength.

160
00:09:27,464 --> 00:09:29,967
He arches back well
to build up his power,

161
00:09:30,067 --> 00:09:32,569
and snaps it out
with incredible force!

162
00:09:33,971 --> 00:09:35,506
It releases so strong,

163
00:09:35,606 --> 00:09:38,709
if it gets past the blockers,
it's not easily picked up.

164
00:09:38,809 --> 00:09:40,544
So he finally
nailed it...

165
00:09:40,644 --> 00:09:42,779
Nice job. You're using
him well, Oikawa...

166
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:46,083
If it were me, I'd have
already sent it to someone else.

167
00:09:46,183 --> 00:09:49,586
Ah, yes, tenacious and daring
at the same time...

168
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:53,357
To make use of Mad Dog...
you can't be skittish about it.

169
00:09:53,457 --> 00:09:55,492
[Hajime]:
Do it, Mad Dog!

170
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:58,329
[Ryunosuke]:
It's out!

171
00:09:59,997 --> 00:10:03,900
His serves are
extremely dynamic!

172
00:10:04,001 --> 00:10:05,836
[Takinoue]:
We're deadlocked...

173
00:10:05,937 --> 00:10:07,171
It's anybody's game.

174
00:10:07,271 --> 00:10:09,506
Yeah... He lands
a lot of shots...

175
00:10:09,606 --> 00:10:12,543
but then he also makes
a lot of mistakes.

176
00:10:14,378 --> 00:10:16,813
It's your serve,
Iwaizumi!

177
00:10:27,124 --> 00:10:27,992
[Watari]:
Cover, cover!

178
00:10:28,092 --> 00:10:29,593
Makki, last shot!

179
00:10:30,661 --> 00:10:31,428
Got it!

180
00:10:31,528 --> 00:10:32,563
[Toru]:
One more, one more!

181
00:10:34,265 --> 00:10:36,000
[Shoyo]:
He spatched
the receive!

182
00:10:36,100 --> 00:10:37,801
[Yu]:
Watch the left!

183
00:10:37,901 --> 00:10:39,603
Oh, you think so, huh?

184
00:10:41,338 --> 00:10:44,908
Mad Dog! The timing is
earlier now! Second tempo!

185
00:10:45,009 --> 00:10:47,678
I'm fully aware that he's
a double‐edged sword.

186
00:10:47,778 --> 00:10:51,148
All the more reason to
make the best use of him!

187
00:10:54,952 --> 00:10:57,154
Right on!

188
00:10:57,254 --> 00:10:58,789
That's a really
nasty angle...

189
00:10:58,889 --> 00:11:01,325
The ability to peel the
blockers off the ball...

190
00:11:01,425 --> 00:11:04,228
Only a setter knows
how good that feels.

191
00:11:06,263 --> 00:11:08,132
Keep hanging in there!

192
00:11:08,232 --> 00:11:09,800
Nice receive!

193
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,435
Center!

194
00:11:17,808 --> 00:11:19,843
You can do it!
[Ryunosuke]:
You got this, Hinata!

195
00:11:19,944 --> 00:11:23,647
Back row again without
getting the chance to spike...

196
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:30,254
This one's mine!

197
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,759
[Tobio]:
Nice receive!

198
00:11:35,859 --> 00:11:38,329
All right, let's go!

199
00:11:44,368 --> 00:11:46,670
[Hitoka]:
Hinata's going for it!

200
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,206
My first back‐row attack!

201
00:11:53,844 --> 00:11:57,548
Did you think now was really
the best time to use that?

202
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:59,916
Oh, yeah, I
thought so, too.

203
00:12:01,218 --> 00:12:02,954
Keep calm... keep calm...
keep calm...

204
00:12:03,054 --> 00:12:05,356
Thanks for messing
up my debut...
Do not punch
him in the face...

205
00:12:05,456 --> 00:12:08,292
I thought they'd
get that side‐out...

206
00:12:08,392 --> 00:12:11,162
They'd better cut
this lead down quick.

207
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:16,333
[Shimada]:
Sugawara's being
called to the bench?

208
00:12:16,433 --> 00:12:18,402
Are they changing up
their setters again?

209
00:12:18,502 --> 00:12:21,272
I thought Kageyama wasn't
doing all that badly...

210
00:12:21,372 --> 00:12:24,375
It's just that Oikawa's
doing that much better.

211
00:12:24,475 --> 00:12:27,111
It looks... like they're
switching him in...

212
00:12:27,211 --> 00:12:28,645
but not for Kageyama.

213
00:12:28,745 --> 00:12:31,215
I cannot let them
run away with this one...

214
00:12:31,315 --> 00:12:33,817
[Keishin]:
I'll do whatever it takes.

215
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:57,308
[Hitoka]:
So Sugawara's subbing
in for somebody?

216
00:12:57,408 --> 00:12:59,543
This is a very tactical
player substitution.

217
00:12:59,643 --> 00:13:02,013
Don't use big, stupid
words like that...

218
00:13:02,113 --> 00:13:04,181
Uh, aren't you
in college?

219
00:13:04,281 --> 00:13:07,084
So, look... some subs
are for when get injured,

220
00:13:07,184 --> 00:13:10,021
and some are for when you want
to bring in pinch servers

221
00:13:10,121 --> 00:13:11,422
or one‐point blockers.

222
00:13:11,522 --> 00:13:14,992
This is a very tactical
player substitution.

223
00:13:19,997 --> 00:13:22,133
In the last match
against Seijoh...

224
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,269
they only subbed this guy
in as kind of last resort

225
00:13:25,369 --> 00:13:27,038
after being cornered.

226
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:29,806
[Shimada]:
But this time, they're
probably subbing him

227
00:13:29,906 --> 00:13:31,875
to try and snag the win.

228
00:13:31,976 --> 00:13:34,045
It's gonna be hard to
make a countermeasure

229
00:13:34,145 --> 00:13:37,281
now that that wildcard Number 16
is runnin' around in there.

230
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:40,317
But still... we're not
gonna let them off the hook.

231
00:13:40,417 --> 00:13:43,320
Right... and there's
still this guy.

232
00:13:44,121 --> 00:13:45,922
[Hajima]:
Your serve, Cap!

233
00:13:52,929 --> 00:13:54,898
All right, here it is.

234
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,569
The serve toss feels good...

235
00:14:09,746 --> 00:14:13,184
The reality of this rivalry
is starting to take shape...

236
00:14:13,284 --> 00:14:17,388
It's gotten more intense with
each time we see each other.

237
00:14:17,488 --> 00:14:20,124
Neither side can surrender
victory to the other,

238
00:14:20,224 --> 00:14:23,427
and both teams have undergone
training as a result.

239
00:14:23,527 --> 00:14:26,263
We keep getting better,
but at the same time...

240
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:27,664
...so have they.

241
00:14:27,764 --> 00:14:31,368
At some point, something
will have to give.

242
00:14:33,404 --> 00:14:35,606
[Hajime]:
Let's get that point!

243
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:44,815
Up front!

244
00:14:45,649 --> 00:14:47,884
[Daichi]:
Nice receive, Nishinoya!

245
00:14:47,985 --> 00:14:48,785
Over here!

246
00:14:48,885 --> 00:14:49,586
Tanaka!

247
00:14:49,686 --> 00:14:51,388
[Daichi]:
Triple block!

248
00:14:57,861 --> 00:14:59,763
Yeah, nice one, Bro!

249
00:14:59,863 --> 00:15:00,931
Thank... God...

250
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:05,336
[Takinoue]:
Oh, here he comes. Interesting.

251
00:15:05,436 --> 00:15:07,271
[Koshi]:
All right, we're gonna catch up!

252
00:15:07,371 --> 00:15:09,640
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeah!

253
00:15:09,740 --> 00:15:11,908
[Asahi]:
All right, it's all you, Suga!

254
00:15:12,009 --> 00:15:13,978
Yeah.

255
00:15:14,078 --> 00:15:14,946
[Watari/Yutaro]:
Bring it on!

256
00:15:15,046 --> 00:15:16,380
[Asahi]:
Come on, Suga!

257
00:15:17,814 --> 00:15:21,652
Serving right after you get
subbed in is nerve‐wracking.

258
00:15:21,752 --> 00:15:24,488
But there's only
one place to aim.

259
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:28,525
[Hanamaki]:
Kyotani!

260
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,761
Y'see that?!

261
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:34,098
[Shimada]:
At this rate... Number 16'll
be late to attack!

262
00:15:41,838 --> 00:15:43,640
Yeah!

263
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:46,510
[Shimada]:
A side‐out!

264
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:49,446
[Chikara]:
One more of those, Suga!

265
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:57,321
[Toru]:
Again...!
Mad Dog is a natural wing
spiker, but he's the type who

266
00:15:57,421 --> 00:15:59,156
aggressively to
do quick‐attacks.

267
00:15:59,256 --> 00:16:02,259
Moving him around through
serves keeps him from starting

268
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:04,228
his approach for a spike.

269
00:16:04,328 --> 00:16:07,965
[Mizoguchi]:
Karasuno's Number 2
really puts us in a bad spot.

270
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:11,768
[Ryunosuke]:
Nice receive, Cap'n!

271
00:16:11,868 --> 00:16:13,137
Sugaaaa!

272
00:16:13,237 --> 00:16:14,705
Okay!

273
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:18,775
Kageyama moved to offense?

274
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,645
[Yutaro]:
They've got FIVE spikers?!

275
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,218
YEAAAAAAH!

276
00:16:27,318 --> 00:16:28,785
WOOOO!

277
00:16:28,885 --> 00:16:31,888
That... was a nice kill...
Ah, dang it...

278
00:16:31,989 --> 00:16:34,091
His line shots are
so freakin' good!

279
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:37,894
Oh, wow! That thing they just
did, was called a two‐setter!

280
00:16:37,995 --> 00:16:42,599
Agh... more of your crazy
technical terms... so then...

281
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:46,070
[Saeko]:
That makes it a tactical
one‐point two‐setter!

282
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,138
That right?

283
00:16:47,238 --> 00:16:48,205
Kinda long...

284
00:16:48,305 --> 00:16:49,506
All right.

285
00:16:49,606 --> 00:16:51,642
[Chikara]:
Keep it goin', guys.

286
00:16:53,744 --> 00:16:58,249
This is a well‐timed
substitution. Just might work.

287
00:16:58,349 --> 00:17:02,153
I guess a third‐year WOULD be
really good at receiving, huh?

288
00:17:02,253 --> 00:17:03,787
Oh, I get it.

289
00:17:03,887 --> 00:17:07,158
In volleyball, each player's
constantly being rotated

290
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:09,093
to new positions on the court.

291
00:17:09,193 --> 00:17:10,427
The front row and back row

292
00:17:10,527 --> 00:17:12,063
both have different
jobs to do...

293
00:17:12,163 --> 00:17:15,032
Each spot in the
rotation's different.

294
00:17:15,132 --> 00:17:17,334
And I would say our most
vulnerable formation

295
00:17:17,434 --> 00:17:20,972
for offense and defense is when
Tsukishima's up to serve.

296
00:17:21,072 --> 00:17:22,906
[Shimada]:
It leaves us open.

297
00:17:23,007 --> 00:17:25,776
We only have two
spikers up front.

298
00:17:25,876 --> 00:17:29,646
And Tsukishima can't
block from the back row.

299
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:32,583
The fact that they can
aggressively score points

300
00:17:32,683 --> 00:17:34,618
even in the trickiest part
of their rotation...

301
00:17:34,718 --> 00:17:36,887
[Shimada]:
that's saying something.

302
00:17:37,854 --> 00:17:39,723
So what do ya think, guys?

303
00:17:39,823 --> 00:17:42,159
Eh... let's pull
him out now.

304
00:17:42,259 --> 00:17:43,694
Good thinking.

305
00:17:46,863 --> 00:17:49,833
[Yu]:
All right, Suga!
Your turn to serve!

306
00:17:51,335 --> 00:17:53,504
Yup. He's aiming
for Mad Dog!

307
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:55,472
Got it!

308
00:17:55,572 --> 00:17:57,241
[Toru]:
Makki, nice!

309
00:17:57,341 --> 00:17:59,843
As always, they're
quick to adapt!

310
00:18:09,353 --> 00:18:10,821
Good job out there, Suga!

311
00:18:10,921 --> 00:18:12,123
Thanks.

312
00:18:12,223 --> 00:18:15,759
Man... I wanted to at
least get us to a tie.

313
00:18:18,795 --> 00:18:20,031
[Tobio]:
Tanaka!

314
00:18:22,266 --> 00:18:24,368
YEAH!

315
00:18:24,468 --> 00:18:26,237
[Koshi]:
Nail it, Kageyama!

316
00:18:28,339 --> 00:18:29,606
[Toru]:
Iwa!

317
00:18:36,913 --> 00:18:38,415
They were able
to get it up!

318
00:18:38,515 --> 00:18:39,951
Coming your way!

319
00:18:40,551 --> 00:18:41,885
Here!

320
00:18:46,823 --> 00:18:50,327
Number 16... You see how
they're so focused on him?

321
00:18:50,427 --> 00:18:54,065
It's obviously a big part
of their offensive strategy.

322
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,666
Yeah... I think so.

323
00:18:55,766 --> 00:18:58,535
[Takinoue]:
Maybe they're trying to draw
attention to Number 16

324
00:18:58,635 --> 00:19:00,804
and then send it over
to someone else.

325
00:19:00,904 --> 00:19:03,740
No matter how much the
ball goes to Mad Dog,

326
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,842
I won't be fooled again!

327
00:19:07,278 --> 00:19:08,212
[Tobio]:
Tanaka!

328
00:19:08,312 --> 00:19:09,313
Got it!

329
00:19:12,016 --> 00:19:16,954
[Toru]:
Nice one!
[Hanamaki]:
I know the reason

330
00:19:17,054 --> 00:19:22,126
It was the one extra punch that
we needed. He came in to attack.

331
00:19:22,926 --> 00:19:24,996
Mad Dog!

332
00:19:25,096 --> 00:19:28,365
If he can't do that,
we're in trouble.

333
00:19:31,302 --> 00:19:32,769
Damn!

334
00:19:35,439 --> 00:19:37,674
It's Getting there,
it's getting there...

335
00:19:37,774 --> 00:19:39,376
(whistle)

336
00:19:39,476 --> 00:19:41,312
Just when it was
getting good!

337
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,118
Well, Seijoh got to
20‐points first, I guess.

338
00:19:47,218 --> 00:19:49,020
But even if we were
to drop this set...

339
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:51,655
we already took the first ,
so we just need the last,

340
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,225
and everything'll
be easy‐breezy!

341
00:19:54,325 --> 00:19:56,060
No...

342
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:58,862
[Shimada]:
It's better to take this set
by any means necessary.

343
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:01,999
If we fail now...
we could lose it all.

344
00:20:03,367 --> 00:20:06,537
[Hajime]:
Kindaichi, one more point!

345
00:20:06,637 --> 00:20:08,005
[Daichi]:
Up front!

346
00:20:09,473 --> 00:20:10,741
Sorry!

347
00:20:10,841 --> 00:20:12,743
Don't aim so hard!

348
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,147
[Daichi]:
Go, Tanaka!
Let's go!

349
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,984
Very nice receive!

350
00:20:32,363 --> 00:20:37,134
Acting as if you're not aware is
actually a form of being aware.

351
00:20:37,234 --> 00:20:39,736
[Hajime]:
Here goes Mad Dog!

352
00:20:43,774 --> 00:20:46,010
COME ON!

353
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:01,158
That kid's gettin'
on my nerves...

354
00:21:01,258 --> 00:21:03,760
[Keishin]:
Subbing in Number 16
was a gamble...

355
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:06,730
Must have been a risk
Seijoh was willing to take.

356
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:08,532
And it's already paid off.

357
00:21:08,632 --> 00:21:12,103
Which is exactly what
I was afraid would happen.

358
00:21:12,203 --> 00:21:13,137
Now, Specs!

359
00:21:13,237 --> 00:21:14,171
Right!

360
00:21:15,772 --> 00:21:17,074
Again? So quick!

361
00:21:17,174 --> 00:21:19,910
Looks like Karasuno used up
all their time‐outs.

362
00:21:21,578 --> 00:21:23,547
With their new weapon Number 16,

363
00:21:23,647 --> 00:21:25,349
they racked up
points wicked fast.

364
00:21:25,449 --> 00:21:29,020
But unfortunately, I think
that what they were really doing

365
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,456
for most of this set
was getting him revved up.

366
00:21:32,556 --> 00:21:37,394
[Irihata]:
Mad Dog may be problematic when
he first steps onto the court...

367
00:21:37,494 --> 00:21:39,796
but then, the fireworks begin!

368
00:21:39,896 --> 00:21:42,066
This is not good...
You see...

369
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,868
When the momentum swings this
wildly, at the beginning...

370
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:48,172
it can set a tone that drives
the rest of the match.

371
00:21:48,272 --> 00:21:51,475
[Shimada]:
At this rate, Seijoh
definitely has the upper hand.

372
00:21:51,575 --> 00:21:55,779
Somehow, we've gotta take this
set or we might not come back.

373
00:21:58,349 --> 00:22:01,318
[Hajime]:
This is your chance, Mad Dog!

374
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:05,322
[Daichi]:
Let's get this point!

375
00:22:05,422 --> 00:22:07,124
[Team Karasuno:
Yeah!

376
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:12,496
I know, Tadashi.
Just be patient.

377
00:22:21,638 --> 00:22:24,208
Please... put me in!

378
00:23:55,199 --> 00:23:57,701
[Toru]:
Looks like your engine's
warming up, Mad Dog.

379
00:23:57,801 --> 00:23:59,336
Let's keep going and
end this, shall we?

380
00:23:59,436 --> 00:24:01,305
[Hajime]:
Let's end this with
one shot, Mad Dog!

381
00:24:01,405 --> 00:24:03,107
[Mad Dog]:
Yessir.
[Toru]:
Why do you only

382
00:24:03,207 --> 00:24:05,676
[Toru]:
I'm not sending any sets
to you anymore!

383
00:24:05,776 --> 00:24:07,044
Next Episode of Haikyu!!
