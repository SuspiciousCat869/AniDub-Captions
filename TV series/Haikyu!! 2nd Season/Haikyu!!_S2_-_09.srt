1
00:00:04,948 --> 00:00:07,718
(HITOKA sighs)
[HITOKA, internal] Dear Mom,

2
00:00:07,818 --> 00:00:12,756
[HITOKA]
They say Tokyo is a cool place,
but it still seems a lot hotter
than Tohoku.

3
00:00:12,856 --> 00:00:17,227
[HITOKA]
We're on the third day of
training camp, which will last
the entire week.

4
00:00:17,327 --> 00:00:19,462
[HITOKA]
So we're almost halfway there.

5
00:00:19,563 --> 00:00:20,363
[DAICHI]
Go! (clap)

6
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:24,467
(uphill running)

7
00:00:24,568 --> 00:00:27,203
[HITOKA, internal]
Everyone's getting pretty
exhausted.

8
00:00:27,303 --> 00:00:32,442
[HITOKA]
Also, it's been roughly three
weeks since Hinata and Kageyama
got into their fight.

9
00:00:32,543 --> 00:00:33,977
[KIYOKO] Good work.
[HITOKA] Here. It's all yours.

10
00:00:34,077 --> 00:00:35,879
[KEI] Thanks.
[ASAHI] Oh, thank you. Aahh..

11
00:00:35,979 --> 00:00:41,184
[HITOKA]
They're back to practicing
together now, but they still
won't talk.

12
00:00:43,954 --> 00:00:45,188
(whistle)

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,962
[HITOKA] Woohoo!
Nice service‐ace!
(KURASUNO celebrates)

14
00:00:52,062 --> 00:00:55,799
[KIYOKO]
As we've been going along...
everybody is making fewer
mistakes.

15
00:00:55,899 --> 00:00:58,802
[KIYOKO]
And the point spread is
decreasing with each set, too.

16
00:00:58,902 --> 00:01:02,472
[HITOKA, internal]
I am so impressed with how
much progress everyone's made.

17
00:01:02,573 --> 00:01:06,142
I was a bit worried about how
down Tsukishima seems to be.

18
00:01:06,242 --> 00:01:08,545
[HITOKA, internal] But maybe
that's just how he always is.
[RYUNOSUKE] One more Asahi,
Let's do it!

19
00:01:08,645 --> 00:01:10,814
[HITOKA, internal] I mean,
he's certainly fatigued,
[KEI] So loud! (whistle)

20
00:01:10,914 --> 00:01:15,051
[HITOKA, internal]
but still manages to be aloof
like usual. So, I guess he's
fine.

21
00:01:19,355 --> 00:01:21,457
[TOBIO, internal]
Dammit! That was short again!

22
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:23,627
(whistle) (FUKURODANI cheers)
[DAICHI] Just shake it off!
We'll get the next one!

23
00:01:23,727 --> 00:01:25,729
[SHOYO & TOBIO]
Sorry!
(whistle)

24
00:01:25,829 --> 00:01:30,233
[HITOKA, internal]
Hinata and Kageyama's new
quick attack isn't going
very well.

25
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:33,704
[HITOKA]
During this training camp‐
(shriek) (jittery)

26
00:01:33,804 --> 00:01:35,338
[BOKUTO]
Sorry about that!

27
00:01:38,008 --> 00:01:42,412
[HITOKA, internal]
During this training camp,
I'd like to see it succeed,
even if only once.

28
00:01:42,513 --> 00:01:43,914
[AKAASHI]
Thanks!

29
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:22,212
(practice game)

30
00:03:22,312 --> 00:03:24,615
(ASAHI breath catch after
chugging)

31
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:26,550
(RYUNOSUKE & YU out of breath)

32
00:03:26,650 --> 00:03:29,419
[KEISHIN, internal]
They're not used to a long
stretch of away games.

33
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,755
The temperature is
only getting hotter...

34
00:03:31,855 --> 00:03:34,591
[KEISHIN, internal]
I'm guessing they'll eventually
start struggling.

35
00:03:34,691 --> 00:03:35,792
(whistle)

36
00:03:38,128 --> 00:03:40,030
[SHOYO]
Center!

37
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,065
[RYUNOSUKE]
Hinata, get the last one!

38
00:03:42,165 --> 00:03:43,800
[RYUNOSUKE]
(gasp) Sorry! Too close!

39
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,369
(SHOYO surprised)

40
00:03:47,938 --> 00:03:50,273
[SHOYO] Ah.. Aaagh!
(NEKOMA celebrates)

41
00:03:52,408 --> 00:03:54,611
[SHOYO, internal]
Everyone else is getting better.

42
00:03:55,546 --> 00:03:57,480
[SHOYO]
Earlier, for just a moment,

43
00:03:57,581 --> 00:04:00,316
there was even something
different about Tsukishima.

44
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:04,454
[SHOYO, internal]
(frustrated) I'm the
only one that's done
absolutely nothing...!

45
00:04:05,656 --> 00:04:07,858
[KOSHI]
I've never seen Hinata
like this before...

46
00:04:07,958 --> 00:04:09,726
He seems kinda agitated, y'know.

47
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:11,094
[TADASHI]
Yeah...

48
00:04:14,397 --> 00:04:15,498
[RYUNOSUKE]
Chance ball!

49
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,333
[YU]
Got it!

50
00:04:17,433 --> 00:04:20,604
[SHOYO, internal]
A chance for a quick‐attack!
It's mine!

51
00:04:25,175 --> 00:04:26,242
(whistle)

52
00:04:26,342 --> 00:04:28,011
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice cover! Nice cover!

53
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:29,279
[ASAHI]
Hinata is pretty clever‐

54
00:04:29,379 --> 00:04:32,015
[SHOYO]
Hey! You just went easy on me!

55
00:04:32,115 --> 00:04:33,183
(HITOKA & KIYOKO surprised)

56
00:04:33,283 --> 00:04:34,317
(TAKEDA & KEISHIN confused)

57
00:04:34,417 --> 00:04:38,488
[TOBIO]
Huh? Went easy? Me?

58
00:04:39,222 --> 00:04:42,125
Really? You think so?

59
00:04:42,993 --> 00:04:44,695
[TOBIO]
Try saying that again.

60
00:04:44,795 --> 00:04:45,829
[DAICHI]
Take it easy, guys!

61
00:04:45,929 --> 00:04:46,997
[TAKEDA]
I'm sorry,

62
00:04:47,097 --> 00:04:48,732
we're gonna need a
time out please!

63
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,300
(long whistle)

64
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:52,703
[SHOYO]
That wasn't the falling
set just now!

65
00:04:52,803 --> 00:04:55,038
(TOBIO shocked)
[TADASHI] (surprised)
What does he mean?

66
00:04:55,138 --> 00:04:59,175
[KEI]
How should I know? It must be
an animal instinct or something.

67
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,111
[TAKEDA] Is he right, Coach?
[KEISHIN] Yeah, well...

68
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,748
If I had to call it one way
or the other, I'd say he's
absolutely right.

69
00:05:04,848 --> 00:05:08,919
Up until this point...
His sets were falling down.

70
00:05:09,019 --> 00:05:12,823
But, the last one looked like it
had more distinctive parabolic
curve on it...

71
00:05:12,923 --> 00:05:15,025
[DAICHI] Kageyama please...
[KEISHIN] (gasp) In other words,

72
00:05:15,125 --> 00:05:19,029
[DAICHI] you need to
calm down alright!
[KEISHIN]
it was like Kageyama wanted to

73
00:05:19,129 --> 00:05:24,034
[KEISHIN]
Recently, the Ginger....
hasn't landed any powerful
spikes.

74
00:05:24,134 --> 00:05:28,505
[KEISHIN]
Which is a tremendous amount of
stress for a spiker.

75
00:05:28,605 --> 00:05:33,043
[KEISHIN]
Kageyama may have unconsciously
been worried that Hinata would
start losing his rhythm.

76
00:05:33,143 --> 00:05:34,878
[KEISHIN]
And he made an adjustment.

77
00:05:34,978 --> 00:05:36,412
(TAKEDA impressed gasp)

78
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,417
[RYUNOSUKE] Calm your ass down!
[KEISHIN]
But Hinata... It's amazing that
you noticed,

79
00:05:41,518 --> 00:05:44,320
[RYUNOSUKE] This isn't the place
for one of your little tickle
fights!
[KEISHIN]

80
00:05:44,420 --> 00:05:46,322
[KEISHIN]
At least you didn't screw up
again...

81
00:05:46,422 --> 00:05:54,030
[TOBIO, internal]
Did I... just make a compromise
without realizing it? (exhale)

82
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,632
[SHOYO]
Keep trying, Kageyama!

83
00:05:55,732 --> 00:05:59,570
[RYUNOSUKE]
I thought I told your scrawny
ass to chill!

84
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:03,940
[TORU]
Have you considered why're
you're having trouble responding
to Small Fry's request?

85
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:07,077
[TORU]
Or whether or not you even want
to put in the effort at all?

86
00:06:07,177 --> 00:06:08,879
(SHOYO seething)

87
00:06:21,257 --> 00:06:23,159
[SHOYO]
What are you doing, Kageyama?

88
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:27,097
[TOBIO] Okay starting tonight...
I'm not practicing with you.
(SHOYO & HITOKA shock)

89
00:06:27,197 --> 00:06:31,568
[TOBIO] And I won't be using
our new quick‐attack during
games either.
[SHOYO] And why not?

90
00:06:31,668 --> 00:06:34,905
[HITOKA, internal]
What? Their relationship's
gotten even worse?

91
00:06:35,005 --> 00:06:38,875
[TOBIO]
"I have to keep trying"...
YOU told me that.

92
00:06:38,975 --> 00:06:40,310
(SHOYO & HITOKA surprised)

93
00:06:41,712 --> 00:06:45,381
[TOBIO]
As it stands now, it's useless
for us to practice together.

94
00:06:45,481 --> 00:06:47,584
[HITOKA]
Um.. uh.. (shock)

95
00:06:47,684 --> 00:06:52,756
[SHOYO]
Okay fine! Kenma!
Send me up a few!

96
00:06:52,856 --> 00:06:53,690
[KENMA]
Eh.

97
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,858
[HITOKA]
Uh what?

98
00:06:58,829 --> 00:07:01,031
[SHOYO, internal]
Kageyama started training
on his own again.

99
00:07:01,131 --> 00:07:03,299
I cannot let him
get ahead of me.

100
00:07:03,399 --> 00:07:05,401
There's one thing I need
to focus on right now!

101
00:07:05,502 --> 00:07:08,539
[SHOYO]
I need to be able to battle
in the air by myself!

102
00:07:13,309 --> 00:07:16,179
[BOKUTO]
Oh, Tsukki, you brought
a friend today?

103
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,080
[KEI]
What?

104
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,182
(SHOYO shock)

105
00:07:19,282 --> 00:07:20,884
[KEI]
What happened to your favorite
partner?

106
00:07:20,984 --> 00:07:23,787
[SHOYO]
Uh Kageyama is working
out by himself.

107
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:27,057
I got Kenma to serve for me, but
he crapped out after 5 balls.

108
00:07:27,157 --> 00:07:30,694
[KUROO]
It's already amazing enough
that Kenma even stuck around
for that long.

109
00:07:30,794 --> 00:07:31,828
[SHOYO]
Anyway...

110
00:07:31,928 --> 00:07:34,330
[SHOYO & HAIBA]
Please let me join you! Hm?

111
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:36,299
[SHOYO] What? Lev?
[HAIBA] Oh, Hinata.

112
00:07:36,399 --> 00:07:40,436
[KUROO]
Hey Lev... uh weren't you
practicing your receives
earlier with Yaku?

113
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:45,275
[HAIBA]
(shock) Yeah, I was doing really
well on my drills today so he
decided to let me go early!

114
00:07:45,375 --> 00:07:47,711
[YAKU] Hey, have you guys seen
Lev anywhere?
[KUROO]
Really? You didn't run away from

115
00:07:47,811 --> 00:07:49,713
[YAMAMOTO]
Probably squirtin' in the can.
[HAIBA]
No. Of course not!

116
00:07:49,813 --> 00:07:52,282
[SHIBAYAMA]
Well he did just run saying that
he got the okay to go.

117
00:07:52,382 --> 00:07:54,518
[YAKU]
(shock) But I never
told him he could go!

118
00:07:54,618 --> 00:07:57,253
[KUROO]
Well, all right.... Okay...

119
00:07:57,353 --> 00:08:01,057
Since we have the right
number of people...
Let's play a 3‐on‐3.

120
00:08:01,157 --> 00:08:04,761
[HAIBA] Oh alright. Cool!
[SHOYO] (excited) Al‐right!

121
00:08:07,931 --> 00:08:12,569
[AKAASHI]
Okay... I'm not so sure this
is a very balanced matchup.

122
00:08:12,669 --> 00:08:19,275
[SHOYO, internal]
(amazed) I'm practicing with the
ace and setter of one of Tokyo's
powerhouse schools!

123
00:08:19,375 --> 00:08:21,411
[SHOYO]
And, I'm playing against
Tsukishima!

124
00:08:21,512 --> 00:08:25,281
[KUROO]
Nah, it's okay; might as
well do it while we can
get away with it.

125
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:29,986
(SHOYO & BOKUTO pumped yelling)

126
00:08:30,086 --> 00:08:32,923
[KAORI]
And when I looked over, there
was a super huge rhino beetle,

127
00:08:33,023 --> 00:08:35,191
and it like totally scared
the crap out of me!

128
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:39,730
[YUKIE] Oh yeah, come to think
of it, I think I like saw a
beetle too.
[KUROO] Lev!

129
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:43,333
[KUROO]
I told you to jump after seeing
the set! It's a read‐block!

130
00:08:43,433 --> 00:08:45,536
[HAIBA]
Oh. Right.

131
00:08:47,403 --> 00:08:49,906
[KUROO] Blockers...
try to avoid sideways jumps!
[SHOYO] Oh man! He picked
that one up!!

132
00:08:50,006 --> 00:08:52,342
[KUROO]
If you can, make sure you stop
and jump straight up!

133
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,276
[KEI]
Okay!

134
00:08:53,376 --> 00:08:54,845
[SHOYO]
Chance ball!

135
00:08:56,680 --> 00:08:59,349
[KEI, internal]
Make sure you stop, and jump
straight up...

136
00:09:01,652 --> 00:09:05,556
[SHOYO]
Awww! Man! Let's try it again!

137
00:09:05,656 --> 00:09:07,958
[YUKIE] Um hey guys!
[ALL] Huh?

138
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:10,694
[YUKIE]
The cafeteria's gonna
be closing up soon...

139
00:09:10,794 --> 00:09:15,265
So if you don't hurry up and
finish your practice you won't
be able to get any dinner.

140
00:09:15,365 --> 00:09:16,833
(BOKUTO, SHOYO, & HAIBA panic)

141
00:09:16,933 --> 00:09:19,936
[KUROO]
An army marches on its
stomach, gentlemen.

142
00:09:20,036 --> 00:09:21,505
[BOKUTO]
Food!

143
00:09:22,372 --> 00:09:24,007
(SHOYO conflicted)

144
00:09:24,107 --> 00:09:25,475
[KUROO] Shorty.
[SHOYO] Oh?

145
00:09:25,576 --> 00:09:28,444
[KUROO]
We'll pick this back up
tomorrow... 'kay?

146
00:09:29,245 --> 00:09:32,616
[SHOYO]
(excited) Yessir!

147
00:09:54,705 --> 00:09:56,740
(ASAHI snoring)
[YU] Hey... Wakey wakey!

148
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,909
[ASAHI]
Yeah. Get out of my face...

149
00:09:59,009 --> 00:10:01,578
(KOSHI sleepy grumbling)
(RYUNOSUKE snoring)

150
00:10:01,678 --> 00:10:03,747
(ASAHI & KOSHI
startled awake by sun)

151
00:10:04,815 --> 00:10:06,517
[SHOYO, TOBIO, & HAIBA]
Time to eat!

152
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:15,458
[KEI]
You eat that much, but all that
nutrition isn't being used to
help you grow any taller.

153
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:22,098
[SHOYO, stuffing face]
Because I use it all for
volleyball, duh!

154
00:10:22,198 --> 00:10:26,102
[KEI]
Nope... I didn't understand a
word of what you just said.

155
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,607
[ASHIYA]
You're up, Goura!

156
00:10:34,978 --> 00:10:37,280
[KOSHI]
It wasn't clean! Kageyama,
follow that up!

157
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,649
[TOBIO]
Hinata!

158
00:10:39,750 --> 00:10:40,717
[DAICHI]
Tanaka, you're open!

159
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:43,520
[RYUNOSUKE]
All right!

160
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:48,358
(whistle)
[RYUNOSUKE]
Sorry bro! I think I might've
been aiming too hard!

161
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:49,793
(long whistle)

162
00:10:49,893 --> 00:10:51,528
[EVERYONE]
Thank you very much!

163
00:10:51,628 --> 00:10:54,230
[DAICHI] Let's go,
time for the hill!
[KURASUNO] Yessir!

164
00:10:54,330 --> 00:10:55,799
[DAICHI]
Tanaka, you run double!

165
00:10:55,899 --> 00:10:57,267
[RYUNOSUKE]
Aw, come on, man!

166
00:10:57,367 --> 00:10:59,169
[ASHIYA]
Wow, that was really close...

167
00:10:59,269 --> 00:11:00,236
[GOURA]
You know what...

168
00:11:00,336 --> 00:11:01,237
[DAICHI]
Go!

169
00:11:01,337 --> 00:11:03,039
(ALL running uphill)

170
00:11:03,139 --> 00:11:05,609
[GOURA]
...I think they're
starting to get better.

171
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:10,781
[RYUNOSUKE] So hungry!
[KOSHI] I know!

172
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:13,517
[ASAHI]
I'm so hungry my stomach's
starting to eat itself.

173
00:11:13,617 --> 00:11:15,185
[YU]
Yeah me, too.

174
00:11:15,285 --> 00:11:19,155
[TADASHI]
This is crazy... How long is
he going to keep at it?

175
00:11:21,124 --> 00:11:22,492
(HITOKA tossing ball up)

176
00:11:25,829 --> 00:11:29,600
[TOBIO]
Agh. Dammit.
Send me up another one!

177
00:11:39,676 --> 00:11:41,377
(TOBIO angry)

178
00:11:41,477 --> 00:11:43,346
(HITOKA concerned)

179
00:11:43,446 --> 00:11:47,183
[KEISHIN]
Kageyama... don't just think of
the plastic bottles as merely
targets.

180
00:11:47,283 --> 00:11:51,622
[KEISHIN]
Now concentrate... Try to
imagine the bottle is the
spiker.

181
00:11:51,722 --> 00:11:55,659
[TOBIO]
Huh... Imagine the... spiker...

182
00:12:00,797 --> 00:12:05,235
[KUROO]
Oh, by the way... When
you're going one‐on‐one
against a spiker,

183
00:12:05,335 --> 00:12:07,370
you don't want to stand
square in front of them...

184
00:12:07,470 --> 00:12:09,873
Better to be standing right in
front of their dominant arm.

185
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,342
(HAIBA amazed)
[KEI] Hm? Okay ...

186
00:12:12,442 --> 00:12:16,947
in the end... we're going
to be adversaries come
game time, aren't we?

187
00:12:17,047 --> 00:12:19,482
So why are you giving
us so much advice?

188
00:12:19,583 --> 00:12:24,187
[KUROO]
What's so weird about me being
nice? And helping my volleyball
brethren.

189
00:12:24,287 --> 00:12:26,222
(KEI & SHOYO confused)

190
00:12:26,322 --> 00:12:28,959
[KUROO]
You don't have to look
at me like that.

191
00:12:30,093 --> 00:12:33,764
[KUROO]
(clears throat) The
"Trashcan Showdown"...

192
00:12:33,864 --> 00:12:36,933
I want to make sure
it happens again.
(surprised)

193
00:12:37,033 --> 00:12:39,235
[NEKOMATA]
All right, let's drink!
[TAKEDA] Sure!
[KUROO]

194
00:12:39,335 --> 00:12:41,605
[NEKOMATA] Huh? Where
the hell is Keishin?
[KUROO]
And I think they deserve it.

195
00:12:41,705 --> 00:12:44,508
[NAOI] Looks like he's
participating in some of the
students' personal training.
[KUROO]

196
00:12:44,608 --> 00:12:48,979
[NEKOMATA] (growl) What tha?
Call his ass out here.[TAKEDA] Yes sir!
[KUROO]

197
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:52,248
Plus.. this ends up being some
good practice for me, too...

198
00:12:52,348 --> 00:12:55,351
So don't get caught up
in the details too much.

199
00:12:55,451 --> 00:12:57,788
[KUROO]
Come on, let's get to work.

200
00:13:01,457 --> 00:13:03,093
[BOKUTO]
Akaashi, cover!

201
00:13:03,193 --> 00:13:05,028
[AKAASHI]
Sorry about that, it was low!

202
00:13:05,128 --> 00:13:08,498
Try to surround him and
spread out the surface
area of the block!

203
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:10,000
(KEI & HAIBA bracing themselves)

204
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,268
[BOKUTO]
Dammit, you're supposed
to be a first‐year!

205
00:13:12,368 --> 00:13:15,639
Why are you so freakin' tall?!

206
00:13:15,739 --> 00:13:17,908
[SHOYO, internal]
(gasp) He hit the block on
purpose?

207
00:13:18,008 --> 00:13:22,245
[BOKUTO]
One more time! Akaashi, give me
a good one!

208
00:13:27,017 --> 00:13:29,319
[BOKUTO]
Yeah! Hey, hey, hey!

209
00:13:29,419 --> 00:13:32,222
[BOKUTO] Whoo! (snickering) Hmm?
[SHOYO] Holy crap Bokuto!
Uh‐that hit you just did..!

210
00:13:32,322 --> 00:13:34,725
[SHOYO]
Did you glance it off the
blocker's hand on purpose?

211
00:13:34,825 --> 00:13:36,459
[BOKUTO]
Yeah! It's a rebound!

212
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,830
[SHOYO]
(gasp) A rebound! Cool!

213
00:13:39,930 --> 00:13:42,198
[BOKUTO]
(flattered) Oh yeah. It is,
isn't it?

214
00:13:42,298 --> 00:13:45,836
(SHOYO enthusiastically nodding)
[KUROO, internal]
Shorty has a natural gift for
flattering people...

215
00:13:45,936 --> 00:13:50,707
[BOKUTO]
Like, if your balance is off and
you feel like you're sure to be
blocked if you take the shot,

216
00:13:50,807 --> 00:13:55,712
you hit the ball against the
blockers on purpose and have it
rebound back so you can set it
up again.

217
00:13:55,812 --> 00:13:57,147
[BOKUTO]
Make sense?

218
00:13:57,247 --> 00:13:58,749
(SHOYO amazed)

219
00:13:58,849 --> 00:14:00,751
[BOKUTO]
But a lot of times
it doesn't work

220
00:14:00,851 --> 00:14:02,819
and the ball ends up getting
slammed back in your face.

221
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:04,821
[AKAASHI]
Yeah that happens to
you a lot, Bokuto.

222
00:14:04,921 --> 00:14:07,991
[BOKUTO]
That was your cue to say it
hasn't been happening to me as
much lately!

223
00:14:08,091 --> 00:14:11,461
Spiking isn't all about slamming
it onto the floor y'know.

224
00:14:11,562 --> 00:14:14,297
[BOKUTO]
If you just stay calm, you'll
have a clear head at the moment
of truth!

225
00:14:14,397 --> 00:14:16,900
(SHOYO gasp)
[AKAASHI] Yeah, that has not
been happening to you a lot
lately.

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,869
[BOKUTO]
Watch it, Akaashi!

227
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,405
[HAIBA]
All right!

228
00:14:24,975 --> 00:14:28,344
[BOKUTO]
Yeah nice one! Short‐stuff, get
the last hit!

229
00:14:28,444 --> 00:14:30,146
[SHOYO] Sure!
(KUROO grins)

230
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:35,251
[BOKUTO]
Aw come on you guys! You don't
have to crowd the guy like that!

231
00:14:35,351 --> 00:14:37,420
[AKAASHI]
This is more of
an umbrella than a wall.

232
00:14:37,521 --> 00:14:41,357
There's no place to go. There's
nowhere to make a shot...

233
00:14:42,526 --> 00:14:44,427
[BOKUTO]
If you stay calm...

234
00:14:46,697 --> 00:14:49,365
[BOKUTO]
...you'll have a clear head at
the moment of truth!

235
00:14:54,871 --> 00:14:57,941
[AKAASHI & BOKUTO, internal]
He shot the ball upwards?!

236
00:14:58,041 --> 00:15:00,343
[SHOYO]
Ouch! (groaning)

237
00:15:03,446 --> 00:15:07,751
[KUROO]
Did you... aim that one?
That was an amazing block‐out.

238
00:15:07,851 --> 00:15:13,323
[SHOYO] (surprised) Well I
guess I did aim at the tip
of Lev's hand...
[HAIBA] What?

239
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:17,794
But it was just coincidence that
it hit him. I can't really shoot
that accurately‐

240
00:15:17,894 --> 00:15:21,297
[BOKUTO]
Oh... That was a triple‐block
with some giant 6'3" blockers,
you know?

241
00:15:21,397 --> 00:15:23,499
And that was a really
nasty ball to hit!

242
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,003
Well done, shorty pants!
Gotta say I'm impressed!
(laughs)

243
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:30,874
[BOKUTO]
To the wee little fighter going
up against the 2‐meter wall, I
have something for you.

244
00:15:30,974 --> 00:15:35,445
[AKAASHI] You're
over‐doing it again.
[KUROO] I think 6 foot 3 just
turned into 6 foot 7...

245
00:15:35,546 --> 00:15:39,616
[BOKUTO]
I... am gonna teach you a
special attack, my man!

246
00:15:39,716 --> 00:15:41,417
[SHOYO]
Really, a special attack?

247
00:15:41,518 --> 00:15:42,485
[BOKUTO]
Yup!

248
00:15:43,887 --> 00:15:45,822
[HITOKA]
Okay here comes the next one!

249
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:56,132
[TOBIO]
Slot 5...

250
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:06,777
(HITOKA impressed)

251
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,848
[TOBIO]
Let's do it again.

252
00:16:14,317 --> 00:16:16,286
(HITOKA yawns)

253
00:16:16,386 --> 00:16:20,090
[KIYOKO]
Yachi, I'm sure you must be
tired after all this... You
gonna make it?

254
00:16:20,190 --> 00:16:21,625
[HITOKA]
Yes! I'll be okay.

255
00:16:21,725 --> 00:16:24,561
[KIYOKO]
Today's the last day. Let's
finish it strong.

256
00:16:24,661 --> 00:16:25,862
[HITOKA]
Yeah!

257
00:16:29,165 --> 00:16:31,301
[HITOKA]
(surprised) Morning, Hinata.

258
00:16:31,401 --> 00:16:34,337
[SHOYO]
Hey! Good morning, Yachi! I'm
pretty hungry, are you?

259
00:16:34,437 --> 00:16:40,577
[HITOKA]
Yeah... I am. You practiced late
last night. Yet somehow you're
so full of energy this morning.

260
00:16:40,677 --> 00:16:43,213
[SHOYO]
Mm‐hm, Yeah well I
just woke up so...

261
00:16:43,313 --> 00:16:45,816
[HITOKA]
(acknowledgement) How's the
training coming along?

262
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:50,186
[SHOYO]
(grin) I'm working on something
really cool, can't wait for you
to see it!

263
00:16:50,286 --> 00:16:51,955
[KEI]
(snicker) What a dork...

264
00:16:52,055 --> 00:16:53,757
(TADASHI snoring)
[SHOYO] What's so funny?

265
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,025
[KEI]
Oh, nothing.

266
00:16:55,125 --> 00:16:57,594
[RYUNOSUKE]
Somebody wake Tadashi up!

267
00:17:02,298 --> 00:17:04,701
[NEKOMATA] And about
what I mentioned...
[DAICHI] Hmm?

268
00:17:04,801 --> 00:17:10,373
[SHINZEN GM]
Yes, it's already been taken
care of as we planned. It should
be arriving around noon.

269
00:17:10,473 --> 00:17:11,608
[NEKOMATA]
I see....

270
00:17:18,682 --> 00:17:20,350
[DAICHI]
Oh my God...

271
00:17:20,450 --> 00:17:22,686
(practice games)

272
00:17:22,786 --> 00:17:25,989
(long whistle)
(YAKU sighs)

273
00:17:26,089 --> 00:17:29,025
[YAKU] It's really hard
for anyone to win against
Fukurodani, isn't it?
[SENGOKU] It's all you, Goura!

274
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:32,763
[SHIBAYAMA] Hey Kuroo!
I did a quick summary
of the current scores!
[YU] Got it!

275
00:17:32,863 --> 00:17:35,498
[KUROO] Thanks a lot!
[KAI] Amazing as always.
[RYUNOSUKE] Right!
[DAICHI] Left!

276
00:17:35,599 --> 00:17:39,703
[YAKU] Just as I thought,
the strongest here is
Fukurodani...
[KOSHI] (groan) Sorry!

277
00:17:39,803 --> 00:17:40,837
(UBUGAWA cheers)

278
00:17:40,937 --> 00:17:43,306
(long whistle)
[ALL] Huh?

279
00:17:43,406 --> 00:17:45,576
[YAKU]
Oh, the Ubugawa‐Karasuno
game ended.

280
00:17:45,676 --> 00:17:47,644
[DAICHI]
Flying laps! Let's go!

281
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:49,513
[ALL]
You got it, Cap'n!

282
00:17:49,613 --> 00:17:53,584
There's a strange dignity
about the way they go for
those penalty laps...

283
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:56,119
[KENMA]
If you include the previous
training camp...

284
00:17:56,219 --> 00:17:58,388
they've done way more
penalty laps than anyone.

285
00:17:58,488 --> 00:18:01,424
[KENMA] I could never do that.
[DAICHI] Well, time
for a flying lap!

286
00:18:04,995 --> 00:18:09,399
[YAKU]
Whoa, Karasuno's Shorty
takes that pretty seriously
doesn't he?

287
00:18:09,499 --> 00:18:12,268
[HAIBA]
Shorty, really? You're one to
talk, Yaku;

288
00:18:12,368 --> 00:18:15,071
I'm mean c'mon you're not any
taller than Hinata, are you?

289
00:18:15,171 --> 00:18:19,075
[YAKU] (anger) Lev! You sit
yourself down right over there!
[KUROO] I can't defend him
against that one.

290
00:18:19,175 --> 00:18:21,978
[HAIBA] Hey. I'm not a dog.
What's the matter?
[YAMAMOTO] I told him not to
mention anything about Yaku's

291
00:18:22,078 --> 00:18:24,447
[HAIBA] Can't you take a joke.
[YAMAMOTO]
no matter what... Dumbass...

292
00:18:25,481 --> 00:18:26,983
[RYUNOSUKE]
(out of breath) Dammit!

293
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,785
We gonna keep losing
'til the very end?

294
00:18:28,885 --> 00:18:31,321
(ALL catching breath)

295
00:18:32,488 --> 00:18:34,991
[DAICHI]
Hang in there! We
have to survive this.

296
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:37,260
[ALL] Huh?
[RYUNOSUKE] Whaddya mean Daichi?

297
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,064
[DAICHI]
Listen guys... I accidentally
overheard something...

298
00:18:41,164 --> 00:18:43,266
At first I thought I should
keep quiet, but...

299
00:18:43,366 --> 00:18:45,536
[RYUNOSUKE]
Wh‐what is it?

300
00:18:48,171 --> 00:18:51,374
[DAICHI]
When all of these practice
matches are over with...

301
00:18:52,976 --> 00:18:57,380
[DAICHI]
...apparently the coaches
are treating us all to some
barbecue!

302
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,549
[RYUNOSUKE]
Bar...

303
00:18:58,649 --> 00:18:59,482
[YU]
...be...

304
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,952
[SHOYO]
...cue?!

305
00:19:02,052 --> 00:19:04,120
[BOKUTO]
Akaashi... who we got up next?

306
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,355
[AKAASHI]
Karasuno.

307
00:19:05,455 --> 00:19:07,090
[KONOHA, SARUKUI, & KOMI]
Karasuno...

308
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,592
[BOKUTO]
What's wrong?

309
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,927
Ah nothing, they're just
kinduv a pain in the butt.

310
00:19:11,027 --> 00:19:14,798
Yeah that's the truth, you can
never predict what kinda crazy
trick they'll try next.

311
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:17,634
But, it looks like
they are getting
pretty tired now...

312
00:19:17,734 --> 00:19:20,470
[RYUNOSUKE]
Meat meat dinner, meaty‐meat
dinner!

313
00:19:20,571 --> 00:19:22,272
[SHOYO]
Meat meat meat with
a side of meat!

314
00:19:22,372 --> 00:19:23,807
[YU]
And meat for dessert!

315
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:26,743
[RYUNOSUKE, SHOYO, & YU]
M‐E‐A‐T! Now we got some energy!

316
00:19:26,843 --> 00:19:28,211
[KONOHA]
Dude. They're freaks.

317
00:19:28,311 --> 00:19:30,113
RYUNOSUKE, SHOYO, & YU]
You and me can eat the meat!

318
00:19:30,213 --> 00:19:31,648
Eat the meat that can't be beat.

319
00:19:31,748 --> 00:19:33,216
Hey Specs... You
didn't tell these guys

320
00:19:33,316 --> 00:19:34,785
anything about the
barbecue, did you?

321
00:19:34,885 --> 00:19:37,353
The only thing the schedule
said is we're having a meal...

322
00:19:37,453 --> 00:19:40,023
Well, good thing
meat's on the menu.

323
00:19:40,123 --> 00:19:42,693
[HITOKA]
Hinata, do your
best in the game.

324
00:19:42,793 --> 00:19:44,127
[SHOYO]
Thank you!

325
00:19:44,227 --> 00:19:46,062
[KEI]
Looking forward to your big
secret attack.

326
00:19:46,162 --> 00:19:48,031
[SHOYO]
Just wait, you four‐eyed
butt‐wad!

327
00:19:48,131 --> 00:19:53,737
[HITOKA]
And... I think I'd really like
to see the new quick‐attack
soon...

328
00:19:53,837 --> 00:19:57,874
[SHOYO]
Mmm.... Well... Uh. yeah!

329
00:19:57,974 --> 00:19:59,309
[HITOKA]
Huh!?

330
00:20:00,243 --> 00:20:02,378
[SHOYO] Kageyama!
[TOBIO] Hm? Huh?

331
00:20:02,478 --> 00:20:05,448
[SHOYO]
I really wanna try and hit that
set that drops down.

332
00:20:08,218 --> 00:20:12,155
[HITOKA, internal]
He told you yesterday that
we won't be doing that
quick‐attack!

333
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,192
[TOBIO]
Don't get so anxious alright...

334
00:20:16,292 --> 00:20:18,161
It's not gonna be
good practice for you

335
00:20:18,261 --> 00:20:20,063
if I'm still messing
up the sets.

336
00:20:20,163 --> 00:20:23,133
(HITOKA shocked)

337
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:27,704
[TOBIO]
I already told you, Hinata, this
isn't about how badly you want
to do it!

338
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:30,741
[TOBIO]
I'll set a ball that WON'T get
stopped by their blockers!

339
00:20:30,841 --> 00:20:33,910
[HITOKA, internal]
That's how he used to sound, but
he's come quite a long way.

340
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:36,212
He actually showed
Hinata some respect.

341
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:38,414
[SHOYO]
I appreciate you being
thoughtful and all,

342
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:41,017
and you being considerate
is kinda freaking me
out a little...

343
00:20:41,117 --> 00:20:43,486
[SHOYO]
But I really want us to try it
soon okay!

344
00:20:43,587 --> 00:20:47,157
[TOBIO]
(annoyed) That's why I'm
practicing so hard, you moron!

345
00:20:47,257 --> 00:20:49,926
(SHOYO shouting)

346
00:20:50,026 --> 00:20:54,665
[HITOKA, internal]
And Hinata firmly believes that
Kageyama will definitely perfect
his sets...

347
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:58,835
[HITOKA, internal]
Oh! So that's why he got so mad
at him before!

348
00:20:58,935 --> 00:21:03,306
(TOBIO heavy breathing)
[HITOKA, internal] Hinata
thought that it was something
that Kageyama could surely do,

349
00:21:03,406 --> 00:21:06,610
but he showed a moment of doubt!

350
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:12,482
[SHOYO] Just how long are
you gonna make me wait?
[HITOKA, internal]
Hinata and Tsukishima always

351
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:16,520
[HITOKA]
But today, I think the crown is
on Hinata's head.

352
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:20,323
[SHOYO]
Thou shalt give me thy best set!
(laughter)

353
00:21:21,758 --> 00:21:23,660
(RYUNOSUKE & DAICHI chuckle)

354
00:21:26,429 --> 00:21:30,534
[KEISHIN]
Okay listen, I know you guys
have been working on some fancy
new tricks...

355
00:21:30,634 --> 00:21:33,737
[KEISHIN] now go out there
and make one of 'em happen.
[ALL] Yessir!

356
00:21:33,837 --> 00:21:39,142
[KEISHIN]
But just promise me one thing;
do not let Fukurodani's No.4
have a field day.

357
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:40,644
[ALL]
Right!

358
00:21:40,744 --> 00:21:43,880
In the end... we spent most
of this camp running laps.

359
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:46,316
But I don't want you to think
it was all for nothing...

360
00:21:46,416 --> 00:21:49,452
every single one of you
has improved along the way.

361
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,351
So you can chalk this one up
as a victory... and let's go
get some grub!

362
00:22:21,451 --> 00:22:23,654
[KURASUNO]
All riiiight!

363
00:23:56,079 --> 00:23:57,313
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's gotta be meat!

364
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:59,182
[YU]
And you can't have
meat without rice!

365
00:23:59,282 --> 00:24:00,617
[SHOYO]
Mm, the perfect combo!

366
00:24:00,717 --> 00:24:02,886
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah, and a meat‐salad
to top it off!

367
00:24:02,986 --> 00:24:05,321
[DAICHI]
We're gonna win this
one and chow down!

368
00:24:05,421 --> 00:24:06,557
[RYUNOSUKE, SHOYO, & YU]
Yeah!

369
00:24:06,657 --> 00:24:09,425
[DAICHI]
Next Haikyu!!
"Gears".
