1
00:00:01,787 --> 00:00:04,456
(final whistle)

2
00:00:09,294 --> 00:00:14,333
Excuse me, guys...
I need to go to the bathroom.

3
00:00:14,433 --> 00:00:16,969
So... go on without me!

4
00:00:17,069 --> 00:00:20,005
He sure takes going to the
bathroom pretty seriously.

5
00:00:20,105 --> 00:00:21,707
Must have
to take a shit.

6
00:00:21,807 --> 00:00:23,809
Oh, come on, man! You don't
have to say it like that!

7
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:26,145
I don't think he went
to the bathroom...
Shit.
Say "Poop."

8
00:00:26,245 --> 00:00:27,446
Shit.
It's "Poop."

9
00:00:27,547 --> 00:00:29,381
Shit.
Say "Poopy."

10
00:00:30,249 --> 00:00:31,851
[Tadashi]:
Um, Coach.

11
00:00:31,951 --> 00:00:33,318
Hmm?

12
00:00:33,418 --> 00:00:36,121
I apologize for wasting
the chance I had!

13
00:00:36,221 --> 00:00:38,490
Taking care of the ball
and staying on offense...

14
00:00:38,591 --> 00:00:41,627
determines whether or not
you're gonna finish on top.

15
00:00:41,727 --> 00:00:44,597
I heard you point that out
at the Fukurodani match.

16
00:00:44,697 --> 00:00:48,668
And Coach, I understand
why I was being put in.

17
00:00:48,768 --> 00:00:54,073
[Tadashi]:
And I wanted to go in and do
my job. To keep us on offense.

18
00:00:54,173 --> 00:00:58,210
But well... I wasn't able
to get it done.

19
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:06,385
Please Coach... Please give
me one more chance!

20
00:01:07,853 --> 00:01:11,190
I know, Tadashi.
Just be patient.

21
00:01:20,533 --> 00:01:23,135
Please... put me in!

22
00:02:57,462 --> 00:03:00,600
[Hajime]:
Come on, Mad Dog!
Show 'em what you got!

23
00:03:07,139 --> 00:03:08,107
Sorry! It's long!

24
00:03:08,207 --> 00:03:09,441
[Toru]:
Mattsun!

25
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:13,579
Dammit, sorry guys!

26
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:16,649
[Takinoue]:
Oh man, this isn't good.

27
00:03:16,749 --> 00:03:18,584
Number 16's in the game.

28
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:19,852
It's a five‐point gap.

29
00:03:19,952 --> 00:03:22,121
You can do it Karasuno!

30
00:03:22,221 --> 00:03:23,756
Let's step back, guys...

31
00:03:23,856 --> 00:03:26,626
I don't think they'll
try to drop one up front.

32
00:03:26,726 --> 00:03:27,459
Yeah.

33
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:28,327
Sounds good.

34
00:03:28,427 --> 00:03:30,362
[Hajime]:
Go for it!

35
00:03:30,462 --> 00:03:32,431
Bring it, bring it, bring it,
bring it, bring it, bring it...

36
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:34,700
Tanaka!

37
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,301
Y'like that?!

38
00:03:39,772 --> 00:03:41,373
Aw, yeah!

39
00:03:41,473 --> 00:03:44,376
[Saeko]:
Alright we're just
getting started baby!

40
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:47,479
[Yu]:
Send it over, Hinata!

41
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,415
Uh, Hey, look,
it's him!

42
00:03:50,516 --> 00:03:51,450
Huh?

43
00:03:53,018 --> 00:03:55,655
Excuse me, we're
making a substitution.

44
00:03:55,755 --> 00:03:58,624
(whistle)

45
00:03:58,724 --> 00:04:01,761
Oh... hey look! It's that
pinch‐server guy!

46
00:04:01,861 --> 00:04:05,698
Ah, the guy that screwed up in
the WakuNan match earlier.

47
00:04:05,798 --> 00:04:07,667
[Spectator 1]:
Of course, I can't blame him.

48
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:10,836
There's no way I'd want to serve
in the situation he was in.

49
00:04:10,936 --> 00:04:13,839
He's the one who came in and
botched the serve before, right?

50
00:04:13,939 --> 00:04:15,775
You think he's
gonna be okay?

51
00:04:15,875 --> 00:04:16,942
Mm‐hmm...

52
00:04:17,042 --> 00:04:18,644
Tadashi, go get
us ten points!

53
00:04:18,744 --> 00:04:22,014
ERK! Yeah, well, that
would end the game...

54
00:04:22,114 --> 00:04:23,448
It sure would.

55
00:04:24,950 --> 00:04:26,285
(chuckles)

56
00:04:26,385 --> 00:04:28,954
Now go ram the ball
up their fat noses!

57
00:04:29,054 --> 00:04:31,957
Yeah. And uh...
Try to keep your cool.

58
00:04:32,057 --> 00:04:32,992
Just get it over.

59
00:04:33,092 --> 00:04:34,393
Over the net.

60
00:04:34,493 --> 00:04:36,028
We all know
you can do it!

61
00:04:36,128 --> 00:04:37,797
Right!

62
00:04:37,897 --> 00:04:44,336
Ready... Now go out there
and get it dooone! Woo!

63
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:50,109
[Shimada]:
Eight seconds.

64
00:04:50,209 --> 00:04:52,344
That's much time
you have to serve

65
00:04:52,444 --> 00:04:54,814
after they blow the whistle,
you understand that, right?

66
00:04:54,914 --> 00:04:58,518
Right.
From what I've seen before,
it's like the whistle

67
00:04:58,618 --> 00:05:01,854
almost surprised you and you
just threw it up and served.

68
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:06,191
Don't get so flustered.

69
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,660
Okay.

70
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,695
So, then... did you
go talk to Coach?

71
00:05:09,795 --> 00:05:12,064
And tell him what
you were thinking?

72
00:05:12,164 --> 00:05:14,166
Uh... Yeah.

73
00:05:14,266 --> 00:05:17,069
[Shimada]:
Well that's
a huge step.

74
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,839
And... you see there...
You're already

75
00:05:19,939 --> 00:05:23,509
a completely different
player than you were before.

76
00:05:23,609 --> 00:05:26,378
Now go out there and do
what you know how to do.

77
00:05:26,478 --> 00:05:28,914
[Shimada]:
Just put the ball in play.

78
00:05:36,722 --> 00:05:38,558
There's some
tension in the air.

79
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:41,260
I can't blame them after
what happened last time.

80
00:05:42,795 --> 00:05:48,233
(heart pounding)

81
00:06:07,853 --> 00:06:09,221
It's out!

82
00:06:24,269 --> 00:06:26,939
(triumphant scream)

83
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,110
YEAHHHHHH!

84
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:32,578
He did it!

85
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:33,412
Kick ass!

86
00:06:33,513 --> 00:06:34,580
Nice freakin' serve!

87
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,682
It's in!

88
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:39,118
Oh yeah, wait...

89
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,920
We were uh...

90
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,387
Cheering for Seijoh...

91
00:06:42,487 --> 00:06:45,024
Yeah, I dunno... I think
they're overdoing it a bit.

92
00:06:45,124 --> 00:06:46,391
It's still only
one point, right?

93
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:49,529
That's it! Get
another one!

94
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:57,537
Did my boy T‐bone just
get a service ace?!

95
00:06:57,637 --> 00:07:00,840
Keep it going!
Catch up!

96
00:07:00,940 --> 00:07:02,207
Sorry about that!

97
00:07:02,307 --> 00:07:04,043
Shake it off!
Don't worry about it!

98
00:07:04,143 --> 00:07:06,211
That was a really
nice serve, man.

99
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:07,947
Honestly, I thought
it was gonna go out.

100
00:07:08,047 --> 00:07:11,450
This is exactly why I
can't stand jump floats.

101
00:07:11,551 --> 00:07:14,620
Damn you, Tadashi you
really nailed that one!

102
00:07:15,054 --> 00:07:16,488
Thanks.

103
00:07:16,589 --> 00:07:18,758
It's really not something
to be all that surprised about.

104
00:07:18,858 --> 00:07:19,859
Huh?

105
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:21,794
Now don't start being
a jerk about it!

106
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,495
[Kei]:
For the past five months he has
practiced serving more

107
00:07:23,596 --> 00:07:25,565
than anyone else on the team.

108
00:07:29,735 --> 00:07:32,404
You seaky little
supportive son of a bitch!

109
00:07:32,505 --> 00:07:34,607
[Shoyo]:
Get another one Tadashi!

110
00:07:34,707 --> 00:07:39,011
Give it all you got. Put the
ball right where you want it!

111
00:07:39,111 --> 00:07:41,080
He's gonna be just fine.

112
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,682
When you run
from something...

113
00:07:42,782 --> 00:07:46,451
It only tends to get
a lot harder.

114
00:07:46,552 --> 00:07:49,121
I'm pretty sure Tadashi
understands that.

115
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,023
More than any
of us do.

116
00:07:51,123 --> 00:07:52,625
Mm‐hm.

117
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,895
It only takes one great
ball... to break through.

118
00:07:55,995 --> 00:07:58,531
Yeah. That's right.

119
00:07:58,631 --> 00:08:01,867
[Keishin]:
And then we can start
our counter‐attack.

120
00:08:01,967 --> 00:08:03,302
Let's cut it off!

121
00:08:03,402 --> 00:08:04,537
You got it!

122
00:08:05,905 --> 00:08:08,107
In this game, it's of the
utmost importance to connect

123
00:08:08,207 --> 00:08:11,176
with your team... but the
serve is when you're out there

124
00:08:11,276 --> 00:08:13,212
all alone.
Yeah...

125
00:08:13,312 --> 00:08:16,081
[Keishin]:
And you could also say that
it's the only play in the game

126
00:08:16,181 --> 00:08:19,318
where you can score with
nothing but your own skills.

127
00:08:20,185 --> 00:08:22,354
Since volleyball first began,

128
00:08:22,454 --> 00:08:24,456
I'd say that serves
have evolved the most

129
00:08:24,557 --> 00:08:25,991
of any part of the sport.

130
00:08:26,091 --> 00:08:29,829
And now, in modern‐day
volleyball, the serve

131
00:08:29,929 --> 00:08:30,996
is the ultimate attack.

132
00:08:31,096 --> 00:08:33,332
It can be used in
any number of tactics.

133
00:08:33,432 --> 00:08:36,201
And is unaffected
by the block.

134
00:08:36,301 --> 00:08:37,937
Yours, Mad Dog!

135
00:08:44,877 --> 00:08:46,679
Son of a bitch!

136
00:08:48,380 --> 00:08:51,183
You did it again
you beautiful bastaaard!

137
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:52,785
All right!

138
00:08:52,885 --> 00:08:55,187
RIGHT OOOON!

139
00:08:55,287 --> 00:08:57,557
Nice serve, man.
(cheering)

140
00:08:57,657 --> 00:09:00,760
Way to goooo!
You freaking see that?!
That was so cool!

141
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:01,961
One more time!

142
00:09:02,061 --> 00:09:04,997
Now, do it again!

143
00:09:05,097 --> 00:09:07,432
Okay, guys, let's go!
All right, bring it on!

144
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:11,904
I got it!

145
00:09:12,004 --> 00:09:15,541
Jump float... means
overhand receives!

146
00:09:15,641 --> 00:09:17,076
[Toru]:
Nice Makki!

147
00:09:18,544 --> 00:09:21,246
They got it! They're
going to attack!

148
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:25,951
[Tadashi]:
Oh, man. Now we've suddenly
gone from predator to prey...

149
00:09:27,219 --> 00:09:29,054
[Hanamaki]:
Iwaizumi!

150
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:32,992
He received it with his body!

151
00:09:33,092 --> 00:09:39,665
Ahh! Not yet, not yet! They're
not taking back the serve yet!

152
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,468
Cover iiiiit!

153
00:09:44,604 --> 00:09:46,171
Thank you, Kageyama!

154
00:09:46,271 --> 00:09:48,140
[Daichi]:
Tsukishima, last hit!

155
00:09:52,745 --> 00:09:55,715
[Team Karasuno]:
Yeaaah! Tsukkiiii!

156
00:09:55,815 --> 00:09:57,082
Did you just see that?!

157
00:09:57,182 --> 00:09:59,852
He did a nice job
deflecting it off the block.

158
00:09:59,952 --> 00:10:02,788
[Takinoue]:
They've gotten the last
three points in a row!

159
00:10:07,326 --> 00:10:08,894
Do it again.

160
00:10:14,534 --> 00:10:16,068
(whistle)

161
00:10:16,168 --> 00:10:18,070
[Shimada]:
Oh... Seijoh's
taking a time‐out.

162
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:20,272
They're trying whatever they
can to stop our momentum.

163
00:10:20,372 --> 00:10:21,507
All right!

164
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,775
Well done guys!

165
00:10:22,875 --> 00:10:24,744
Way to go Tadashi,
you just made Seijoh

166
00:10:24,844 --> 00:10:26,411
have to use one
of their time‐outs!

167
00:10:26,512 --> 00:10:28,514
You rock Tadashi!
Thanks a lot, Suga!

168
00:10:28,614 --> 00:10:30,015
That Number 12 is nuts.

169
00:10:30,115 --> 00:10:32,618
You see that insane
receive he pulled off?

170
00:10:32,718 --> 00:10:35,220
I'm pretty sure that was
nothing more than dumb luck!

171
00:10:38,257 --> 00:10:42,461
Ow... That really hurt...!

172
00:10:42,562 --> 00:10:44,797
[Saeko]:
That's it guys!
Kick their butts!

173
00:10:44,897 --> 00:10:47,800
You've got this,
now keep it up, guys!

174
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:49,935
I can't do what
those other guys do.

175
00:10:50,035 --> 00:10:53,673
I want to control my body...
I want to control the ball.

176
00:10:53,773 --> 00:10:57,109
I want what it takes to
stand up to my opponents!

177
00:10:58,310 --> 00:11:00,646
(whistle)

178
00:11:01,647 --> 00:11:04,750
Tadashi! Get another one!

179
00:11:04,850 --> 00:11:06,886
Watch the ball
all the way in!

180
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:07,953
Right!

181
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:15,160
[Shimada]:
Listen to me, Tadashi.

182
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:18,564
Don't give them the luxury of
being able to control the ball.

183
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:20,299
Use a direct trajectory...

184
00:11:20,399 --> 00:11:23,503
Aim to go just barely over
the white belt of the net...

185
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:25,805
[Tadashi]:
...And let it fly!

186
00:11:31,243 --> 00:11:33,813
I only have one weapon...

187
00:11:35,014 --> 00:11:37,449
...my serve.

188
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:39,585
I get put into the game
for one reason.

189
00:11:39,685 --> 00:11:42,021
And that's my one chance.

190
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:46,859
For one point at a time, it's
all on me. Everything is on me.

191
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:49,795
I have the power to change
the game's momentum.

192
00:11:49,895 --> 00:11:51,764
Because that's my job.

193
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:58,403
(crowd cheering)

194
00:11:58,504 --> 00:12:00,540
I'm the pinch server.

195
00:12:02,107 --> 00:12:04,309
Nice net!

196
00:12:04,409 --> 00:12:05,911
A little luck
never hurts!

197
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:09,649
No. It's more
than luck, Specs.

198
00:12:09,749 --> 00:12:14,587
[Hitoka]:
OhmyGod... we're tied!

199
00:12:33,806 --> 00:12:35,708
[Spectator 1]:
Karasuno totally caught 'em!

200
00:12:35,808 --> 00:12:37,777
[Spectator 2]:
Now they're all tied up!

201
00:12:38,678 --> 00:12:40,012
I... don't believe it...

202
00:12:40,112 --> 00:12:42,515
Tadashi had a net ball
in the other match, too!

203
00:12:42,615 --> 00:12:44,684
He is one lucky
little devil!

204
00:12:44,784 --> 00:12:45,918
Mm‐hm! Mm‐hm!

205
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,720
They both may have
been net balls.

206
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,389
But the one during the WakuNan
match and the one just now

207
00:12:50,489 --> 00:12:52,124
are different.

208
00:12:52,224 --> 00:12:54,560
[Shimada]:
During the WakuNan match,
Tadashi was probably

209
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,428
more concerned about
whether or not the serve

210
00:12:56,529 --> 00:12:58,698
would stay in bounds.

211
00:12:58,798 --> 00:13:00,199
But right now...

212
00:13:00,299 --> 00:13:02,935
he's thinking about exactly
where to land the ball.

213
00:13:03,035 --> 00:13:08,641
The difference is... Now Tadashi
is serving on the offensive.

214
00:13:08,741 --> 00:13:14,146
[Saeko]:
Tadashi is turning
into a stud!
Although I'm not sure it was

215
00:13:14,246 --> 00:13:17,282
No matter what I do,
I keep throwing my serve tosses

216
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:18,551
really low...

217
00:13:18,651 --> 00:13:21,954
Alrighty! Everybody calm down!

218
00:13:22,054 --> 00:13:23,823
We're all calm, dude.

219
00:13:23,923 --> 00:13:25,991
There's nothing we could
have done with that last one.

220
00:13:26,091 --> 00:13:27,793
We'll get the
next one, okay?

221
00:13:27,893 --> 00:13:30,329
Aw look at you guys! You're
all so poised and put‐together

222
00:13:30,429 --> 00:13:32,297
it's making me kinda sad.

223
00:13:32,397 --> 00:13:33,866
Heh!

224
00:13:38,037 --> 00:13:39,104
Hmph.

225
00:13:46,979 --> 00:13:50,583
There's a slow spin on it.
It won't shift around as much!

226
00:13:50,683 --> 00:13:52,384
I got it!

227
00:13:52,484 --> 00:13:54,153
Nice receive!

228
00:13:58,758 --> 00:13:59,592
Coming back!

229
00:13:59,692 --> 00:14:01,160
Great one‐touch!

230
00:14:03,195 --> 00:14:04,564
Asahi!

231
00:14:04,664 --> 00:14:05,831
Nice, Kageyama!

232
00:14:05,931 --> 00:14:07,533
[Daichi]:
Triple block!

233
00:14:07,633 --> 00:14:10,002
That's a pretty
high wall they've set up!

234
00:14:13,272 --> 00:14:14,774
To the baaaack!

235
00:14:14,874 --> 00:14:17,009
Aaaahh...

236
00:14:19,244 --> 00:14:20,613
Yeaaaaah!

237
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:25,718
Whoa. Oh man Are you freakin'
serious? Is this happening?

238
00:14:25,818 --> 00:14:28,654
[Spectator 1]:
Karasuno's at
match point!

239
00:14:28,754 --> 00:14:30,556
One more point, guys!
Keep on it!

240
00:14:30,656 --> 00:14:34,894
[Takeda]:
Good job Tadashi...
You're the hero of this match.

241
00:14:35,628 --> 00:14:37,196
One more point.

242
00:14:37,296 --> 00:14:39,665
Please boys, please
don't jack this up...!

243
00:14:39,765 --> 00:14:42,267
Come on! Land this sucker!

244
00:14:42,367 --> 00:14:43,603
Finish it off...!

245
00:14:43,703 --> 00:14:47,339
Tadashi! Get us one more point!

246
00:14:47,439 --> 00:14:49,341
[Shoyo]:
Bring it home!

247
00:14:58,818 --> 00:15:00,352
That felt good.

248
00:15:03,388 --> 00:15:04,990
This one's mine!

249
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:08,360
Damn, that guy's good.

250
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:16,335
Get the block!
Stop it, please!

251
00:15:20,372 --> 00:15:22,407
Yeaaaah!

252
00:15:22,508 --> 00:15:23,475
Nice job!

253
00:15:23,576 --> 00:15:24,977
We finally stopped the bleeding.

254
00:15:25,077 --> 00:15:27,179
But how many points did
he manage to take from us?

255
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,750
(whistle)

256
00:15:34,253 --> 00:15:36,288
That was a fantastic
performance!

257
00:15:36,388 --> 00:15:37,422
Good job!

258
00:15:37,523 --> 00:15:39,258
Thanks you very
much, Coach.

259
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:41,293
All right!

260
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:45,230
Stay focused you guys!

261
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:50,235
Next time... I'll
get the ten points.

262
00:15:52,137 --> 00:15:54,473
We are gonna win!

263
00:15:54,574 --> 00:15:58,511
Tadashi has given us
new life. We have a chance!

264
00:16:00,445 --> 00:16:01,581
Way to go!

265
00:16:01,681 --> 00:16:03,182
[Daichi]:
We can't let it
go to waste!

266
00:16:05,785 --> 00:16:07,653
YEAH!

267
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:09,622
Nice one, Man‐bun!

268
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:11,056
Here we go again!

269
00:16:11,156 --> 00:16:12,658
We're back at
match point!

270
00:16:12,758 --> 00:16:15,327
Do iiiit!

271
00:16:20,265 --> 00:16:22,334
They got back in
the game so easily.

272
00:16:22,434 --> 00:16:24,537
Even though they're cornered
they still managed to get off

273
00:16:24,637 --> 00:16:28,407
a quick attack. And on top
of that it was right up front.

274
00:16:28,508 --> 00:16:32,512
[Keishin]:
If it was up to me, I'd totally
be relying on the ace right now.

275
00:16:34,914 --> 00:16:35,915
[Daichi]:
Nice receive!

276
00:16:36,015 --> 00:16:37,416
[Hajime]:
It's a dump!

277
00:16:41,821 --> 00:16:44,489
Hey, loosen up. You're
playing too stiff.

278
00:16:44,590 --> 00:16:45,625
Yeah! Okay!

279
00:16:45,725 --> 00:16:47,292
You got this.

280
00:16:47,392 --> 00:16:49,361
We're right on the edge here.

281
00:16:49,461 --> 00:16:53,198
I cannot let this be the last
match ever for our third‐years.

282
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:56,802
[Hajime]:
Get out of your head Kindaichi,
we need you in the game.

283
00:16:56,902 --> 00:16:59,739
No matter what the situation...
we can handle it.

284
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:01,406
It's just us
and the ball.

285
00:17:01,507 --> 00:17:03,576
Uh... Right!

286
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:05,477
Asahi! Crush it!

287
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,179
Make it count!

288
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:15,621
It's long! Get to it!

289
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:21,861
Aw... Yeah!

290
00:17:21,961 --> 00:17:24,196
Nice kill!
Heck yeah!

291
00:17:24,296 --> 00:17:26,165
Everything you'd
expect from Seijoh.

292
00:17:26,265 --> 00:17:30,402
This next point.
It's huge. Here we go.

293
00:17:32,437 --> 00:17:36,075
[Irihata]:
Now, in modern‐day volleyball,
the serve is one of the

294
00:17:36,175 --> 00:17:38,177
most effective attacks.

295
00:17:38,277 --> 00:17:41,581
It can be used in
any number of tactics.

296
00:17:41,681 --> 00:17:44,016
And is unaffected by the block.

297
00:17:48,788 --> 00:17:51,423
It is the ultimate attack.

298
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:11,944
That was basically a spike!

299
00:18:13,278 --> 00:18:15,681
Yeah!

300
00:18:15,781 --> 00:18:17,517
Nice oooone!

301
00:18:17,617 --> 00:18:19,018
Well done!

302
00:18:19,118 --> 00:18:21,353
Here we go Oikawa,
let's go get another point!

303
00:18:21,453 --> 00:18:24,089
Now all of a sudden
Seijoh has set point!

304
00:18:24,189 --> 00:18:26,025
Think they'll be able
to finish it off?

305
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:29,061
Damn it Noya!

306
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,997
Okay. We can't
do this alone.

307
00:18:33,065 --> 00:18:35,735
Asahi. Listen up.
I'm counting on you!

308
00:18:35,835 --> 00:18:37,369
Sure.

309
00:18:37,469 --> 00:18:39,772
[Takeda]:
Asahi is going to help
with the serve‐receive?

310
00:18:39,872 --> 00:18:41,707
If that's the call
from Daichi and Noya...

311
00:18:41,807 --> 00:18:45,244
then it's probably for the best.
When Oikawa serves...

312
00:18:45,344 --> 00:18:49,281
it's power... more so than
it's about his control.

313
00:18:49,381 --> 00:18:51,083
We can't let his
serve go untouched.

314
00:18:51,183 --> 00:18:52,652
We need to get
a hand on it.

315
00:18:52,752 --> 00:18:55,555
[Keishin]:
We have to get
the ball into the air.

316
00:18:56,622 --> 00:18:58,190
We've done it before.

317
00:18:58,290 --> 00:19:01,260
We dug up a ton of serves
from Ubugawa and Fukurodani.

318
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:04,930
It'll be okay.
We can do this.

319
00:19:05,030 --> 00:19:06,966
Bring it on!

320
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,569
Let's gooo!

321
00:19:17,710 --> 00:19:19,078
[Yu]:
Daichi!

322
00:19:19,879 --> 00:19:21,681
All right! Huh?

323
00:19:25,618 --> 00:19:26,652
[Daichi]:
Nice Tanaka!

324
00:19:26,752 --> 00:19:27,953
[Ryunosuke]:
Kageyama!

325
00:19:28,053 --> 00:19:30,355
[Daichi/Yu]:
Asahi!

326
00:19:32,324 --> 00:19:34,393
Way to go, nice receive!

327
00:19:49,108 --> 00:19:51,310
(whistle)

328
00:19:53,613 --> 00:19:56,616
Dude, they totally
took back the set!

329
00:19:56,716 --> 00:19:59,218
I thought it really might
be Karasuno in straight sets.

330
00:19:59,318 --> 00:20:01,687
Man! We had them
on the ropes!

331
00:20:01,787 --> 00:20:02,855
Don't give up!

332
00:20:02,955 --> 00:20:04,223
You can still
do it, guys!

333
00:20:04,323 --> 00:20:07,126
Damn... this third set
is gonna be rough.

334
00:20:07,226 --> 00:20:08,928
Just leave that behind us!

335
00:20:09,028 --> 00:20:10,162
Yeah!

336
00:20:10,262 --> 00:20:12,598
That serve really
is amazing. Isn't it?

337
00:20:12,698 --> 00:20:14,767
Well yours is pretty
awesome, too!

338
00:20:14,867 --> 00:20:17,570
You can tell he has a lot
more experience than I do.

339
00:20:17,670 --> 00:20:20,873
[Tadashi]:
And I don't mean just because
he's a third‐year.

340
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:22,542
There's more to it than that.

341
00:20:22,642 --> 00:20:24,944
[Shoyo]:
What do you mean?

342
00:20:25,044 --> 00:20:28,347
[Tadashi]:
Jump serves have a lot of power
but they carry a lot of risk

343
00:20:28,447 --> 00:20:31,450
in return. To put that
much power into it...

344
00:20:31,551 --> 00:20:34,687
right in the middle of
pressure situation like that,

345
00:20:34,787 --> 00:20:37,056
a lot of things can go wrong.

346
00:20:39,825 --> 00:20:41,594
It's not even fair.

347
00:20:43,095 --> 00:20:44,697
[Ryunosuke]:
Tadashi!

348
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:46,298
Some nasty
serves, my man.

349
00:20:46,398 --> 00:20:50,870
Thank you. But, I still
have a ways to go.

350
00:20:50,970 --> 00:20:54,807
Only about half of them...
are acutally any good.

351
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:57,610
[Ryunosuke]:
Well... then we'll have
to totally celebrate

352
00:20:57,710 --> 00:20:59,679
the half that were good!

353
00:20:59,779 --> 00:21:01,881
You'll have plenty of time
to pout and regret

354
00:21:01,981 --> 00:21:03,448
the crappy
ones later.

355
00:21:03,549 --> 00:21:06,285
So right now, grab ahold of
the good stuff by jumblies...

356
00:21:06,385 --> 00:21:08,053
and make sure you
never forget 'em!

357
00:21:08,153 --> 00:21:09,488
You killed it man!

358
00:21:09,589 --> 00:21:12,792
And then, m'dude...
you can do again next time!

359
00:21:15,595 --> 00:21:17,096
Yeah!

360
00:21:18,598 --> 00:21:22,502
So it looks like we're
going into full sets. Hmph.

361
00:21:24,504 --> 00:21:28,373
[Daichi]:
From the very first
practice match...

362
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:37,750
...and then the
Inter‐High prelims...

363
00:21:44,156 --> 00:21:47,593
...until right now,
the semi‐finals...

364
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:57,436
We've always had the most
intense matches with these guys.

365
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:02,341
They're a challenging opponent.

366
00:22:02,441 --> 00:22:04,043
[Toru]:
An aggravating opponent.

367
00:22:04,143 --> 00:22:07,112
[Daichi]:
Until last year,
we didn't really know much

368
00:22:07,212 --> 00:22:08,914
about each other.

369
00:22:09,014 --> 00:22:13,285
[Toru]:
They were supposed
to be nothing to us.

370
00:22:13,385 --> 00:22:16,789
[Toru/Daichi]:
But this is exactly how
it's supposed to play out.

371
00:22:18,858 --> 00:22:21,026
[Toru]:
The final set...

372
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:23,696
[Daichi]:
...Our final battle.

373
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:57,156
[Hitoka]:
That was amazing,
Tadashi!

374
00:23:57,256 --> 00:23:58,991
[Tadashi]:
Uh, thanks, Yachi.

375
00:23:59,091 --> 00:24:01,493
[Hitoka]:
Just in case, I had an AED,
a stretcher, and a coffin

376
00:24:01,594 --> 00:24:04,296
all at the ready. But we didn't
need any of it, did we?

377
00:24:04,396 --> 00:24:06,465
[Tadashi]:
Did you just say
you broght a coffin?

378
00:24:06,566 --> 00:24:09,669
