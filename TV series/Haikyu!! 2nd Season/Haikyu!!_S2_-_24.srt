1
00:00:02,752 --> 00:00:04,920
Slam it down!
Up front!

2
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,594
[Team Karasuno]:
All right!

3
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:14,764
Yeah! A side‐out!
Woo! How d'you
like that?!

4
00:00:14,864 --> 00:00:16,331
We turned this
sucker back around!

5
00:00:16,431 --> 00:00:19,902
Amazing! He hit it in front
of their attack line!

6
00:00:20,002 --> 00:00:22,304
[Shimada]:
He's hitting with the
snap from his wrist,

7
00:00:22,404 --> 00:00:24,039
so it's a pretty weak shot.

8
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,975
But as long as you can
shake the blockers off,

9
00:00:26,075 --> 00:00:28,443
they can't dig it up
from there...

10
00:00:28,544 --> 00:00:30,279
[Takinoue]:
So uh...

11
00:00:30,379 --> 00:00:33,148
do you think Kageyama adjusted
it to Hinata intentionally?

12
00:00:33,248 --> 00:00:36,185
Or did he just kinda mess up
in a good way?

13
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,421
That was so badass! It was like
you hit it straight down!

14
00:00:39,522 --> 00:00:41,390
[Ryunosuke]:
Did you aim for that?!

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,425
Hinata was really close
to the net...

16
00:00:43,526 --> 00:00:45,294
so I made the ball
close to him...

17
00:00:45,394 --> 00:00:47,362
I'm just glad
it played out well.

18
00:00:47,462 --> 00:00:51,033
[Toru]:
Ironically, the most
ingenius part of Kageyama...

19
00:00:51,133 --> 00:00:54,236
...is not his technique,
but probably his stupidity.

20
00:00:54,336 --> 00:00:56,906
[Toru]:
He plunges forward
without hesitation

21
00:00:57,006 --> 00:00:59,341
when a normal person
would hesitate.

22
00:00:59,441 --> 00:01:05,715
And he's going to keep doing it
for better or for worse.

23
00:01:05,815 --> 00:01:08,283
When he's in the moment,
he can't see anything around him

24
00:01:08,383 --> 00:01:12,087
and has no idea that nobody else
is keeping up with him.

25
00:01:14,056 --> 00:01:15,290
But...

26
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,826
now a tiny little idiot

27
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:18,994
that goes even further
than him has appeared.

28
00:01:19,094 --> 00:01:22,431
I only jumped up to where there
weren't any blockers around!

29
00:01:22,532 --> 00:01:24,634
We gotta watch
Numbers 9 and 10.

30
00:01:24,734 --> 00:01:29,238
Yeah. Those two morons
surprise me each and every time.

31
00:01:30,305 --> 00:01:32,341
[Toru]:
However...

32
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:36,278
a cohesive team of six is
stronger than just two.

33
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:37,713
[Yutaro]:
Bring it on!

34
00:01:37,813 --> 00:01:39,615
[Watari]:
Let's do it!
[Hanamaki]:
We're gonna

35
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:43,118
Glad you see it that way.

36
00:01:48,558 --> 00:01:51,561
We are the ones
who are gonna win!

37
00:03:29,424 --> 00:03:31,160
[Daichi]:
Do it, Tsukishima!

38
00:03:32,194 --> 00:03:33,428
I got it!

39
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:37,099
That most recent attack...
it had to be a fluke.

40
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:41,170
Before they can figure it out,
I will crush them!

41
00:03:43,472 --> 00:03:44,874
Oh yeah!

42
00:03:44,974 --> 00:03:48,277
(excited cheering)

43
00:03:50,613 --> 00:03:52,181
Yeah!

44
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,850
(excited cheering)

45
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,888
Yeah!

46
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:01,223
You can do it, Matsukawa!

47
00:04:03,859 --> 00:04:05,360
You got this.

48
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,428
Yeah!

49
00:04:06,529 --> 00:04:07,963
A pinch server, huh?

50
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:10,733
Guess they're trying
to bolster their defenses.

51
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:13,569
[Hajime]:
You're up, Yahaba!

52
00:04:13,669 --> 00:04:14,870
At full strength...!

53
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:17,039
[Daichi]:
Asahi!

54
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:17,773
Sorry!

55
00:04:17,873 --> 00:04:18,708
Cover, cover!

56
00:04:18,808 --> 00:04:19,809
Tanaka!

57
00:04:19,909 --> 00:04:21,310
[Yu]:
Double block!

58
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,245
[Toru]:
Yahaba!

59
00:04:23,345 --> 00:04:25,080
Sure! Kyotani!

60
00:04:25,180 --> 00:04:26,148
Damn!

61
00:04:28,117 --> 00:04:30,185
Yeah, that way!
Yeah!

62
00:04:30,285 --> 00:04:32,054
Did he hit with
his left hand?!

63
00:04:32,154 --> 00:04:34,423
I thought that guy
was right‐handed!

64
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,425
Did he synchronize
on the fly?

65
00:04:36,526 --> 00:04:40,763
Ambidextrous and able to
reposition himself in midair...

66
00:04:46,035 --> 00:04:49,404
[Takinoue]:
A side‐out... If they
get to 20 points first,

67
00:04:49,505 --> 00:04:50,706
it's gonna be tricky.

68
00:04:50,806 --> 00:04:53,342
Please... please,
Don't let them pull away!

69
00:04:55,344 --> 00:04:56,311
Right on!

70
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,813
Nice receive!

71

[Team Karasuno]:
(cheering)

72
00:05:13,763 --> 00:05:15,197
That little brat!

73
00:05:15,297 --> 00:05:17,232
(whistle)

00:05:21,303 --> 00:05:23,138
It's all you!

76
00:05:23,573 --> 00:05:24,774
Yeah!

77
00:05:27,943 --> 00:05:29,679
Excellent! We've caught up!

78
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,014
Yeah, what concentration.

79
00:05:32,114 --> 00:05:35,484
[Keishin]:
These guys really
surprise me sometimes.

80
00:05:38,854 --> 00:05:40,590
[Watari]:
Got it!

81
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,824
Watch out for
the right side!

82
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,492
Number 16!
Defend it!

83
00:05:43,593 --> 00:05:44,760
Nice one‐touch!

00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:45,961
Now you gotta
connect it!

85
00:05:46,061 --> 00:05:47,697
Watch the left,
it's a spatch!

86
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:49,164
Pull back!

87
00:05:51,601 --> 00:05:54,069
Whoa... Amazing...

All right!

93
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,055
[Toru]:
Okay, we don't
have far to go now!

94
00:06:14,023 --> 00:06:16,592
Well, it looks like
they got there first.

95
00:06:19,094 --> 00:06:23,265
[Daichi]:
Let's not panic!
It's just one point.

(whistle)

97
00:06:49,925 --> 00:06:52,294
[Spectator 2]:
There he is! It's
that pinch server

98
00:06:52,394 --> 00:06:55,598
who racked up five points
in a row during the second set!

99
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:00,002
Do it!

100
00:07:00,102 --> 00:07:01,871
Here's your
shot, Tadashi!

101
00:07:01,971 --> 00:07:03,272
Remember to
stay calm!

102
00:07:03,372 --> 00:07:05,140
Give them
everything you got!

103
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,041
Right!

104
00:07:06,141 --> 00:07:07,442
Come on!
Tadashi!

105
00:07:07,543 --> 00:07:08,711
You can do it!
Tadashi!

106
00:07:08,811 --> 00:07:11,046
[Hitoka]:
Do it just like before!

107
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,916
Tadashi.

108
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:17,219
Now get us a point.

109
00:07:24,727 --> 00:07:27,129
[Shimada]:
You can do it!

110
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:34,970
It's out.

111
00:07:37,072 --> 00:07:38,340
No, wait...

112
00:07:41,977 --> 00:07:44,113
The trajectory
changed this time.

113
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,148
All right!
Let's goooo!

114
00:07:49,251 --> 00:07:51,621
Argh! You freakin'
kidding me?!

115
00:07:51,721 --> 00:07:52,855
Last hit, it's you!

116
00:07:52,955 --> 00:07:54,456
Mine!

117
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:56,191
[Ryunosuke]:
Chance ball!

118
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,062
[Team Karasuno]:
Synchronized attack!

119
00:08:04,834 --> 00:08:06,168
Yeah!

120
00:08:06,268 --> 00:08:09,038
Whoa! He is really
in the zone now!

121
00:08:09,138 --> 00:08:11,340
Really nice one,
Iwaizumi!

122
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,008
Wow...

123
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:15,377
[Toru]:
Makki!

124
00:08:17,412 --> 00:08:19,181
It's a feint!

125
00:08:19,281 --> 00:08:20,382
Damn it!

126
00:08:20,482 --> 00:08:23,686
All right! We cut Number 12
off at just one serve!

127
00:08:23,786 --> 00:08:24,654
Nice kill!

128
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:26,421
Yeah!

129
00:08:26,522 --> 00:08:28,658
When I first started
playing volleyball,

130
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:31,661
spikes were the only part
of the game that I liked.

131
00:08:31,761 --> 00:08:33,295
But now...

132
00:08:33,395 --> 00:08:35,164
I've learned the pleasure
of taking something my opponents

133
00:08:35,264 --> 00:08:38,668
thought was a perfect shot
and sending it right back.

134
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:40,536
(whistle)

135
00:08:42,004 --> 00:08:43,506
It's okay, dude!

136
00:08:44,907 --> 00:08:47,009
But still,
I've gotta say...

137
00:08:47,109 --> 00:08:48,978
he is hardly the
same guy I remember

138
00:08:49,078 --> 00:08:51,480
from the Inter‐High
prelims...

139
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:54,684
That wasn't your fault...
They just made a play.

140
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,751
Just shake it off.

141
00:08:55,851 --> 00:08:56,586
[Ryunosuke]:
All right!

142
00:08:56,686 --> 00:08:58,521
Okay.

[Keishin]:
Tadashi.

144
00:09:00,489 --> 00:09:02,992
It was a very
good serve, kid.

145
00:09:09,464 --> 00:09:12,735
Every single point counts...
we can't let up!

146
00:09:12,835 --> 00:09:14,604
Right...

147
00:09:14,704 --> 00:09:17,106
[Keishin]:
The only way to win this
is to go after every ball

148
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,475
as if it's the most
important one in the game.

149
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:32,888
Neither side is
letting up at all...

150
00:09:32,988 --> 00:09:34,389
So uh... If it's a deuce again,
do they playing until it's ,/
a two‐point ga‐

No... We can't settle,

Whoa, what was that...?

156
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:10,359
A serve like that
at this point...

He must be some kind of monster!

You know what to do.

00:10:34,717 --> 00:10:38,954
Just make contact.
We're not gonna lose this one.

165
00:10:39,054 --> 00:10:39,989
That's right!

166
00:10:40,089 --> 00:10:42,224
(whistle)

167
00:10:44,393 --> 00:10:45,861
Give it all you got!

168
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:48,463
Of course.

169
00:10:48,564 --> 00:10:53,402
Okay... it's finally time, guys.
It's now or never!

170
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:04,614
[Seijoh Crowd]:
Oooooooolé!

171
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:19,194
Yeah!

172
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:31,440
Yeah!

173
00:11:31,541 --> 00:11:33,308
Finally! Get him
outta there!

174
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:37,279
But even so... It's still
match point for Seijoh.

175
00:11:37,379 --> 00:11:39,414
[Shimada]:
We've gotta be very careful.

176
00:11:39,515 --> 00:11:42,384
Holy crap. It's
over for Karasuno

177
00:11:42,484 --> 00:11:44,520
if they miss even
one more point.

178
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:46,889
[Scorekeeper 2]:
And they're about
to lose their libero.

179
00:11:47,623 --> 00:11:48,758
Hey, Specs.

180
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:50,192
Got it.

181
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:51,293
Here goes!

182
00:11:51,393 --> 00:11:53,996
(whistle)

183
00:11:54,096 --> 00:11:56,365
[Keishin]:
It's the final battle.

184
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:16,852
Here goes.

185
00:12:16,952 --> 00:12:19,321
(whistle)

186
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:21,757
[Keishin]:
It's the final battle.

187
00:12:23,425 --> 00:12:25,661
Whoa! I bet they're totally
gonna use the tactical

188
00:12:25,761 --> 00:12:27,763
one‐point two‐setter
now, guys!

189
00:12:27,863 --> 00:12:31,100
If we can't get a side‐out
here, they're toast...

190
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,167
Good luck, guys.

191
00:12:32,267 --> 00:12:34,136
Yeah!

192
00:12:34,236 --> 00:12:36,171
[Takinoue]:
Oh man, all we can do it hope
for the best at this point.

193
00:12:36,271 --> 00:12:39,041
Okay, Kageyama,
I've got an idea.

194
00:12:39,141 --> 00:12:41,811
Let's go, Suga!
It's all you, man!

195
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:51,220
He always gets extremely focused
at the tail end of a game.

196
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,255
Where does that come from?

197
00:12:53,355 --> 00:12:54,890
Dude! What're you doin'?!

198
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:57,459
Why are you picking a fight
with Hinata right now?

199
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:59,662
This is where
we're gonna end it!

200
00:12:59,762 --> 00:13:00,696
Yeah!

201
00:13:00,796 --> 00:13:02,598
Come on, Suga!
Eyes on the prize, dude!

202
00:13:02,698 --> 00:13:04,667
If I make a mistake,
it's all over.

203
00:13:04,767 --> 00:13:08,137
And if we can't survive
their attack, it's all over.

204
00:13:08,237 --> 00:13:09,672
Okay!

205
00:13:13,475 --> 00:13:16,912
In or out? Me or Iwaizumi?

206
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:22,484
They dug it up! But it
kept their ace in check!

207
00:13:22,585 --> 00:13:23,753
Center!

208
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:49,078
YEAAAAH!
We stopped it!

209
00:13:49,178 --> 00:13:51,847
Hinata!

210
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:54,449
Come on, I don't see
what the big deal is...

211
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,352
That is what the
middle blocker DOES.

212
00:13:59,188 --> 00:14:00,590
Dude I'm SO sorry!

213
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:03,893
I'm surprised you lived
through that, Kageyama!

214
00:14:03,993 --> 00:14:05,394
Karasuno caught up!

215
00:14:05,494 --> 00:14:06,762
It's deuce...!

216
00:14:06,862 --> 00:14:07,897
Sorry.

217
00:14:07,997 --> 00:14:08,831
It's fine!

218
00:14:08,931 --> 00:14:10,265
Just keep moving!

219
00:14:10,365 --> 00:14:12,067
It wasn't like he went
in to shut them out,

220
00:14:12,167 --> 00:14:15,771
but more like he just
sprung up to where the ball was.

221
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:21,210
Every single time, Shorty's
reaction speed astonishes me.

222
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:23,646
[Ryunosuke]:
Suga, serve up a winner!

223
00:14:23,746 --> 00:14:24,980
Here!

224
00:14:26,281 --> 00:14:28,017
[Toru]:
Front! Up front!

225
00:14:28,117 --> 00:14:31,386
Whoa! That barely went
into their front side!

226
00:14:31,486 --> 00:14:32,555
It broke 'em!

227
00:14:32,655 --> 00:14:34,690
Now he's trying
to set Iwaizumi off?

228
00:14:34,790 --> 00:14:36,559
He seems all
nice and pleasant,

229
00:14:36,659 --> 00:14:39,595
but his serves aren't
pleasant at all!

230
00:14:41,697 --> 00:14:44,133
[Asahi]:
Front, front!

231
00:14:44,233 --> 00:14:45,968
Drop down!

232
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:48,638
I got it!

233
00:14:49,071 --> 00:14:50,640
Yes, Suga!

234
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:53,208
There we go,
got the first touch.

235
00:14:53,308 --> 00:14:56,912
[Toru]:
Now we won't see that same
attack pattern from last time!

236
00:14:57,847 --> 00:14:59,348
Come on!

237
00:15:01,751 --> 00:15:04,253
We just need to get
a finger on it!

238
00:15:04,353 --> 00:15:06,922
Bring it to me!

239
00:15:16,031 --> 00:15:18,534
No, no, no, no, no!

240
00:15:43,793 --> 00:15:44,293
Yeah...

241
00:15:44,393 --> 00:15:46,896
KAGEYAMA!

242
00:15:53,135 --> 00:15:54,970
I won't do it.

243
00:15:55,638 --> 00:15:57,773
I won't lose...

244
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:02,545
[Hitoka]:
Only one more point!

245
00:16:02,645 --> 00:16:05,615
Man... even I thought
Kageyama wouldn't attack

246
00:16:05,715 --> 00:16:07,049
after that last touch.

247
00:16:07,149 --> 00:16:09,151
Gotta hand it to them, they're
really starting to get

248
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:10,620
into Seijoh's heads.

249
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,555
Yeah. That, and there's
the impression

250
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:15,558
[Shimada]:
that when Sugawara comes in,
he's up to something.

251
00:16:15,658 --> 00:16:16,826
So even if just a little bit,

252
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:19,494
their attention
gets drawn to him.

253
00:16:21,196 --> 00:16:23,232
That really pisses me off!

254
00:16:23,332 --> 00:16:25,701
Nothing less from
Oikawa's protégé.

255
00:16:25,801 --> 00:16:28,070
That confidence he has
when the chips are down...

256
00:16:28,170 --> 00:16:31,607
that's all part of being
an amazing setter.

257
00:16:31,707 --> 00:16:33,709
Yeah, you do
have a point.

258
00:16:33,809 --> 00:16:35,945
[Yahaba]:
I want some
of that, too.

259
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:46,155
Are you saying you already know
the limitations of your power?

260
00:16:46,255 --> 00:16:48,858
You think you know
all about your technique,

261
00:16:48,958 --> 00:16:52,161
your body, your mind...
even though none of those

262
00:16:52,261 --> 00:16:53,763
have been perfected?

263
00:16:53,863 --> 00:16:57,533
If you believe that a person
was simply born with something

264
00:16:57,633 --> 00:17:01,804
superior to you. That they
just possess a God‐given gift?

265
00:17:01,904 --> 00:17:05,508
Then it is impossible
to overcome.

266
00:17:05,608 --> 00:17:08,578
No matter your effort,
your creativity,

267
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:10,713
nor even
your teammates.

268
00:17:10,813 --> 00:17:13,015
In fact, it's not
even really a problem.

269
00:17:13,115 --> 00:17:15,250
It's not worth lamenting
because you see it

270
00:17:15,350 --> 00:17:17,953
as a foregone conclusion.

271
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:21,991
[Ukai]:
It's a trap. You will only lock
yourself in a spiral of failure

272
00:17:22,091 --> 00:17:25,394
and ineptitude. Don't
bother comparing your skills

273
00:17:25,494 --> 00:17:26,929
to that of another.

274
00:17:27,029 --> 00:17:31,033
Instead, you have only
yourself to improve upon.

275
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,069
Your path is yours
and yours alone.

276
00:17:36,271 --> 00:17:39,308
"Today may be the day
you sieze the opportunity

277
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,611
to make your talent bloom.

278
00:17:43,345 --> 00:17:48,584
Or maybe tomorrow, the day after
that, or even next year...

279
00:17:48,684 --> 00:17:51,854
...or even maybe after
you turn 30.

280
00:17:51,954 --> 00:17:55,725
[Toru]:
The time you choose to make
it happen is up to you.

281
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,392
But if you think
you don't have it,

282
00:17:57,492 --> 00:18:00,863
then you probably won't have
it for your entire life."

283
00:18:00,963 --> 00:18:05,668
Is it just me or... has
Oikawa changed recently?

284
00:18:05,768 --> 00:18:10,439
Go, Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐Sei‐Seijoh!

285
00:18:10,540 --> 00:18:14,677
Go, go, let's go, Karasuno!
Hey! Get with the program, man!

286
00:18:14,777 --> 00:18:16,946
If they drop it as far forward
as they did earlier,

287
00:18:17,046 --> 00:18:19,782
I'll get it...
You take the back.

288
00:18:19,882 --> 00:18:20,516
Right!

289
00:18:20,616 --> 00:18:21,884
Stay on your guard...

290
00:18:21,984 --> 00:18:25,420
there's a chance they could
drop it on us again.

291
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,289
It's ours, we just
gotta take it.

292
00:18:27,389 --> 00:18:28,591
Yeah!

293
00:18:28,691 --> 00:18:30,125
Keep it near the
edge of the court!

294
00:18:30,225 --> 00:18:31,360
Yeah, I know...

295
00:18:31,460 --> 00:18:32,828
If I send up a weak serve,

296
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,664
they'll make us pay
for it immediately.

297
00:18:34,764 --> 00:18:37,066
Okay, guys! We just gotta
get a hand on it!

298
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,333
Right!

299
00:18:40,202 --> 00:18:41,403
We'll take it back!

300
00:18:41,504 --> 00:18:43,238
Let's take this one!

301
00:18:46,341 --> 00:18:48,778
Yeeeah!

302
00:18:51,847 --> 00:18:54,149
[Ryunosuke]:
Make it count, Suga!

303
00:18:59,722 --> 00:19:00,923
[Hanamaki]:
Up front!

304
00:19:01,023 --> 00:19:02,257
[Yutaro]:
Iwaizumi!

305
00:19:02,357 --> 00:19:03,859
Keep him in check!

306
00:19:09,298 --> 00:19:10,633
TANAKAAAA!

307
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:12,067
Let's go!

308
00:19:12,167 --> 00:19:14,103
[Koshi]:
Let's finish it off right here!

309
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,312
Argh! They got to it!

310
00:19:23,412 --> 00:19:24,847
But look! A spatch!

311
00:19:24,947 --> 00:19:26,682
[Hanamaki]:
Oikawa!

312
00:19:27,382 --> 00:19:29,685
It's a chance ball!

313
00:19:41,564 --> 00:19:43,398
He was outside the court!

314
00:19:43,498 --> 00:19:47,069
[Keishin]:
How the hell did
he make that play?!

315
00:19:47,169 --> 00:19:49,672
[Keishin]:
It's goin' to Number 4!

316
00:19:52,074 --> 00:19:54,677
[Toru]:
Talent is something to nurture.

317
00:19:54,777 --> 00:19:57,847
And wisdome is
something to hone!

318
00:20:00,349 --> 00:20:01,751
This is it!

319
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,222
No! No!

320
00:20:07,322 --> 00:20:08,758
Yeah!

321
00:20:14,296 --> 00:20:16,265
The last hit!

322
00:20:16,365 --> 00:20:19,735
A cohesive team of six is
stronger than just two.

323
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:22,171
Get to it!

324
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:24,306
Chance ball!

325
00:20:24,406 --> 00:20:26,341
I don't think so...

326
00:20:26,441 --> 00:20:28,377
He can't hit it from there!

327
00:20:28,477 --> 00:20:30,112
Not on my watch!

328
00:20:39,454 --> 00:20:41,456
Nice one, Mad Dog!

329
00:20:41,557 --> 00:20:43,926
Slam it, Kageyama!

330
00:20:48,430 --> 00:20:49,932
You kidding me...?!

331
00:20:52,502 --> 00:20:55,337
Leave this one to MEEEEE!

332
00:20:55,437 --> 00:20:58,073
Come at me, Tobio Kageyama.

333
00:20:58,173 --> 00:21:01,443
Come at me with your
strongest weapon...

334
00:21:01,544 --> 00:21:03,245
[Toru]:
Give it to me...!

335
00:21:10,319 --> 00:21:13,188
No! Did they read in
to the switch...?!

336
00:22:00,703 --> 00:22:01,637
All...

337
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:05,374
...RIIIIIGHT!

338
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:57,186
[Takinoue]:
We won! We won!
We woooonnnn!

339
00:23:57,286 --> 00:23:59,454
[Takinoue]:
(howling in victory)
[Shimada]:
(sobbing)

340
00:23:59,555 --> 00:24:02,191
Wha‐ Shimada...?! Don't
tell me you're crying!

341
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:04,159
[Shimada]:
N‐No, my contact
just fell out...

342
00:24:04,259 --> 00:24:06,061
[Takinoue]:
Dude, you
wear glasses.

343
00:24:06,161 --> 00:24:09,899
[Takinoue]:
Next Haikyu!!
