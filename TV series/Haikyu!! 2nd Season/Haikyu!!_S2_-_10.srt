1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:08,875
[TAKEDA]
Wow Coach... to think we've
played more than 60 sets but
only won three of them so far...

2
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,444
[NEKOMATA] Come on, you need
another drink. Pronto!
[TAKEDA]
We've been walking on a thorny

3
00:00:11,545 --> 00:00:13,947
[NAOI] No, if I drink any more
my liver might fall out.
[KEISHIN]
(laugh) Got that right.

4
00:00:14,047 --> 00:00:16,149
[NEKOMATA] Oh you'll be fine.
Trust me!
[KEISHIN]
But, well, if we

5
00:00:16,249 --> 00:00:18,384
[NAOI] I dunno. I've never
trusted you before.
[KEISHIN]
we were back during

6
00:00:18,484 --> 00:00:20,654
[NAOI] And I'm not
about to start now.
[KEISHIN]
we might have won

7
00:00:20,754 --> 00:00:22,956
[NEKOMATA] Now let me get
this straight mister,
[KEISHIN]
By centering on Hinata

8
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:25,291
[NEKOMATA] are you trying to
tell me that you're not gonna
drink my sake?
[KEISHIN]

9
00:00:25,391 --> 00:00:28,094
[NAOI] Yeah... no....
[KEISHIN]
Karasuno's attack style was
complete in its own way.

10
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:29,930
[NEKOMATA]
It's a joke, lighten up already!

11
00:00:30,030 --> 00:00:31,364
[KEISHIN]
But using that strategy,

12
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,399
the limits became
quickly apparent.

13
00:00:33,499 --> 00:00:35,201
And, Seijoh capitalized on it.

14
00:00:35,301 --> 00:00:37,604
[KEISHIN]
So that's why we had to start
trying new things.

15
00:00:37,704 --> 00:00:40,040
[TAKEDA] Yeah.
Understandably so.
[KEISHIN] Huh?

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:43,376
[TAKEDA]
The way I look at it, everybody
is their own cog in the machine.

17
00:00:43,476 --> 00:00:45,779
[TAKEDA]
Every gear is its own piece.

18
00:00:45,879 --> 00:00:49,983
[TAKEDA]
And alone, there's no way we can
win against a powerhouse team
from the Kanto region.

19
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,485
[TAKEDA]
But, if all the cogs
fall into place...

20
00:00:55,088 --> 00:00:56,590
(KEISHIN grin)

21
00:00:56,690 --> 00:01:00,594
Hey! Don't think you can win
against Nekoma that easily!

22
00:01:00,694 --> 00:01:03,263
[TAKEDA]
Easily? I never said
anything like that!

23
00:01:03,363 --> 00:01:05,265
[TAKEDA]
But we still plan on winning.

24
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:07,433
[NEKOMATA]
Oh, you will huh?

25
00:01:07,534 --> 00:01:10,003
Well look who's decided to
talk a little smack?! (laugh)

26
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:11,672
(TAKEDA laughs)

27
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,212
[DAICHI]
Okay, this is our final set. And
we've gotten our butts handed to
us the entire camp.

28
00:01:19,312 --> 00:01:23,116
[DAICHI]
The least we can do before we go
home is take one from these
guys...

29
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:25,719
So let's show
Fukurodani who's boss!

30
00:01:25,819 --> 00:01:29,489
[ALL]
Yeah!

31
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:33,093
[SHOYO]
I will prove that I learned
something from this trip!

32
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:16,897
(practice game)

33
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,032
[EVERYONE]
Thanks for the game!

34
00:03:19,132 --> 00:03:21,802
[DAICHI] Yeah! Let's land one!
[YU, KEI, TOBIO, &
RYUNOSUKE] Yeah!

35
00:03:21,902 --> 00:03:24,838
[BOKUTO]
All right! Bring
it on, Karasuno!

36
00:03:24,938 --> 00:03:26,439
(whistle)

37
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,141
[YU]
Go for it, Asahi!

38
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:29,910
(ASAHI focused exhale)

39
00:03:35,315 --> 00:03:37,083
[HITOKA]
Ah! There it goes!

40
00:03:37,183 --> 00:03:38,785
[AKAASHI] Bokuto!
[BOKUTO] Yeah!

41
00:03:38,885 --> 00:03:40,020
[DAICHI]
Left, No.4!

42
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:41,421
[KEI]
Tighten up for line shots...

43
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:44,224
He'll get through even
the smallest gap.

44
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,227
[BOKUTO]
Oh?

45
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:48,494
[KOMI]
It's out!

46
00:03:48,595 --> 00:03:49,996
(whistle)
(FUKURODANI celebrates)

47
00:03:50,096 --> 00:03:52,165
[KEISHIN] Blocked out, huh...
[TAKEDA] That was close!

48
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,968
[DAICHI] Shake it off,
Tsukishima! You almost got it!
[BOKUTO]
Maybe it's not the

49
00:03:55,068 --> 00:03:55,936
[KEI]
Quiet.

50
00:03:56,036 --> 00:03:57,638
[KONOHA]
Left, left!

51
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,007
[SHOYO]
Oh man, he picked that up!

52
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:02,576
[KOSHI]
But it's out of control!

53
00:04:06,112 --> 00:04:08,481
(whistle)
[TAKEDA] From that situation to
a quick‐attack?!

54
00:04:08,582 --> 00:04:10,584
(annoyed) Even if the
receive is out of control..

55
00:04:10,684 --> 00:04:12,719
they can still do quick
attacks with confidence.

56
00:04:12,819 --> 00:04:15,722
[KEISHIN] And their setter is
pretty damn good himself.
[AKAASHI] Nice serve!

57
00:04:15,822 --> 00:04:17,524
[HISASHI]
Break it off at one point!

58
00:04:17,624 --> 00:04:19,660
[CHIKARA]
(surprised) No.4 has moved
up to the front line!

59
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:21,261
[BOKUTO]
I can finally hit up front!

60
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:23,296
(whistle)
[KOMI] Serve's up!

61
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:25,031
[DAICHI]
Yours, Nishinoya!

62
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:26,567
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice receive!

63
00:04:27,701 --> 00:04:30,303
[BOKUTO]
Nice one, Saru!
Gimme the last one!

64
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:34,407
[KEISHIN]
Right now, we're at the point
where our wall is the highest on
the court.

65
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:37,043
[KEISHIN]
Go show them what you can do!

66
00:04:39,212 --> 00:04:43,383
(whistle)
[KOSHI] Just how sharp of an
angle can that guy land those
cut shots?

67
00:04:43,483 --> 00:04:46,419
[HITOKA] Oh?
[KIYOKO] A powerful hit that
cuts right in front of three
blockers...

68
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,088
It can be hard
to pull off.

69
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,355
And causes some physical strain

70
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:51,091
if you don't keep your
shoulders relaxed.

71
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,458
(HITOKA gasp)

72
00:04:52,559 --> 00:04:54,561
[BOKUTO]
All right!

73
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:56,630
(boastful laugh) Did
you see that, Akaashi?!

74
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:59,600
I mean did you frickin'
see my super cut‐shot I
just did?! Huh?

75
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:01,602
[AKAASHI]
Yeah I saw it, it
was pretty incredible.

76
00:05:01,702 --> 00:05:03,203
[BOKUTO]
Eh, it was a fluke! (laughing)

77
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:05,506
[KUROO]
Bokuto really needs
to shut up...
(KENMA yawns)

78
00:05:05,606 --> 00:05:08,108
[RYUNOSUKE]
Cool... but a... fluke right?!

79
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:09,776
[ASAHI]
I wish I could do that.

80
00:05:09,876 --> 00:05:13,246
You know that Bokuto from
Fukurodani. He's a different
player.

81
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:17,350
[BOKUTO] Hey, can I maybe try
making that shot one more time?
I wanna land another one!
[TAKEDA] I can't quite put my

82
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:19,720
[AKAASHI]
I think the other team will
completely see it coming,
Bokuto.

83
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:23,023
[BOKUTO] Oh! Yeah, I bet you're
right! Then, I guess I'll aim
for a line shot.
[TAKEDA]

84
00:05:23,123 --> 00:05:25,058
Exactly...

85
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:27,360
[KEISHIN]
He might be the type of player
who boosts the morale

86
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:29,730
of his friends
and enemies alike.

87
00:05:32,098 --> 00:05:33,366
[SHOYO & YU]
Boo‐yah!

88
00:05:33,466 --> 00:05:34,935
[RYUNOSUKE]
Serve it up Tsukishima!

89
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,403
[SHOYO] A special attack?
[BOKUTO] You know it!

90
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,840
Okay.. About this attack...

91
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:43,343
What it does... is fool
the enemy with static and
dynamic movements.

92
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:45,579
(SHOYO interested)
[BOKUTO] Yeah

93
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:47,514
[AKAASHI]
There he goes exaggerating
again...

94
00:05:47,614 --> 00:05:49,616
[KUROO]
So do you actually know what
he's talking about?

95
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:51,317
[AKAASHI]
Um I can only guess.

96
00:05:51,417 --> 00:05:55,589
Now this attack isn't
something you use to
escape from the enemy.

97
00:05:55,689 --> 00:06:00,927
[BOKUTO]
It's about perfect timing, a
perfect set, and a perfect
stance for spiking.

98
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:04,698
[BOKUTO]
You want everyone to think a
powerful spike is coming.

99
00:06:04,798 --> 00:06:07,433
[BOKUTO]
Above all else... You even want
yourself to think you have

100
00:06:07,534 --> 00:06:10,537
the perfect chance
to land the perfect kill!

101
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,906
[YU]
Leave it to me!

102
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:14,107
[SHOYO]
Nice receive!

103
00:06:15,776 --> 00:06:19,012
[BOKUTO]
Make it look like you're gonna
smash 'em right in the nose!

104
00:06:19,913 --> 00:06:21,181
(AKAASHI, RYUNOSUKE, & TOBIO
surprised)

105
00:06:21,281 --> 00:06:22,382
(BOKUTO & TAKEDA shocked)

106
00:06:22,482 --> 00:06:23,917
[KEISHIN]
Wait. D'you see that?!

107
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:27,487
[KEISHIN]
Little Ginger tricked 'em!

108
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:31,224
[BOKUTO]
When the feint succeeds...

109
00:06:31,324 --> 00:06:32,593
there's this glorious feeling

110
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:34,695
that's different from when
you land a spike.

111
00:06:34,795 --> 00:06:36,663
[BOKUTO]
You know how several receivers
all jump in

112
00:06:36,763 --> 00:06:38,999
trying to dig the ball and
it hits the floor right in
front of them?

113
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:43,336
[SHOYO] Yes.
[BOKUTO] You can look right into
their eyes the second they just
barely miss the ball,

114
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:46,840
[BOKUTO]
and then they land and look up
at you like little confused
puppy dog.

115
00:06:47,674 --> 00:06:49,543
(KOMI, SARUKUI, & KONOHA
surprised)

116
00:06:50,677 --> 00:06:52,979
[BOKUTO]
Oh man that is just the best.

117
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,148
(SHOYO astonished)

118
00:06:56,883 --> 00:07:00,286
[BOKUTO]
He just faked us out!

119
00:07:00,386 --> 00:07:03,056
[AKAASHI]
Bokuto, you were the one who
taught him that move.

120
00:07:03,156 --> 00:07:05,225
(BOKUTO shocked)
(discouraged)

121
00:07:05,325 --> 00:07:06,527
(KOMI, SARUKUI, & KONOHA angry)

122
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,562
Did you seriously just
use your stupid head?

123
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:10,163
Are you feeling okay!

124
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,800
[SHOYO]
Oh shut up, I use my
stupid head all the time!

125
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,303
Hmph! I say we don't let them
get another point the rest of
the way!

126
00:07:17,403 --> 00:07:19,740
[AKAASHI]
I think it'll be impossible to
completely shut them out‐

127
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,975
[BOKUTO]
Can you just play along with me
once in a while?

128
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:26,713
[BOKUTO]
Damn that little Pipsquek!
I am not going to lose to him!

129
00:07:27,914 --> 00:07:29,215
[ASAHI]
No.2!

130
00:07:30,617 --> 00:07:31,618
[RYUNOSUKE]
Eat it!

131
00:07:31,718 --> 00:07:33,153
[SHOYO]
Okay...!

132
00:07:33,253 --> 00:07:35,088
[TAKEDA] Well one
thing is for sure.
[SHOYO] One‐touch!

133
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:37,390
[TAKEDA] Everyone seems
to be playing well.
[DAICHI] Got it!

134
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,561
Maybe that just some of
Bokuto's good influence.

135
00:07:42,863 --> 00:07:45,131
[TAKEDA]
Oh, a setter dump, Coach!
(KURASUNO celebrates)

136
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:50,170
Kageyama's doing well, too!
I don't think I've seen him miss
a single jump‐serve today.

137
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,973
[KEISHIN]
Yeah... he's looking pretty
relaxed isn't he?

138
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:55,942
[KEISHIN]
Like the calm before a storm.

139
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:59,680
[KEISHIN]
Or a leopard ready to pounce.
Kinda dangerous.

140
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,982
[DAICHI]
Tsukishima, let's get one more!
You can do it!

141
00:08:02,082 --> 00:08:09,189
[TOBIO, internal]
I feel good. It's like my
stomach is completely empty.
But, I'm not hungry yet.

142
00:08:09,289 --> 00:08:14,460
[TOBIO, internal]
I'm moving better than usual,
and I can see everyone else's
movements.

143
00:08:14,561 --> 00:08:17,731
[TOBIO, internal]
My conditioning. It feels great.

144
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,203
[DAICHI] It's up!
[RYUNOSUKE] Nice, Daichi!
[TOBIO, internal]
And it looks like everyone

145
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:25,539
[TOBIO, internal]
Does it have something to do
with the barbecue?

146
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,611
[TOBIO, internal]
Hinata's playing well,
too. He's not making any
unnecessary movements.

147
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:37,150
[TOBIO, internal]
Maybe now... we can use the new
quick‐attack. But I don't
know...

148
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:40,954
[RYUNOSUKE]
Asahi, nice receive!

149
00:08:41,054 --> 00:08:43,056
(TOBIO gasps)

150
00:08:43,156 --> 00:08:46,893
[TOBIO]
I know he wants to do it. But if
we miss now,

151
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:49,796
we might break the momentum
that the team has going.

152
00:08:49,896 --> 00:08:54,200
[TOBIO]
The new quick‐attack can be
saved for when we have a higher
success rate‐

153
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,602
[SHOYO]
We doing this?

154
00:08:55,702 --> 00:08:57,237
(TOBIO focused exhale)

155
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,153
[SHOYO]
The ball comes...

156
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:18,124
[SHOYO]
...and then... it stops.

157
00:09:21,528 --> 00:09:23,163
(BOKUTO, WASHIO, & AKAASHI gawk)

158
00:09:23,263 --> 00:09:24,631
(HITOKA & KIYOKO gawk)

159
00:09:24,731 --> 00:09:26,332
(TAKEDA & KEISHIN gawk)

160
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:27,868
(whistle)

161
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,173
(SHOYO & TOBIO excited yelling)

162
00:09:33,273 --> 00:09:35,609
[TOBIO]
Wait! What the hell was that?
You're supposed to give me a
heads up!

163
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:38,645
[SHOYO]
But you felt like we had it just
now, right? I mean didn't you
feel it?!

164
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:41,481
[TOBIO] I did, but this
is way too sudden!
[BOKUTO] What the hey? That
weird quick‐attack is back?

165
00:09:41,582 --> 00:09:43,950
[TOBIO] I gotta get mentally
prepared and stuff!
[AKAASHI] No. That wasn't it...
[BOKUTO] Hmm?

166
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:46,419
[SHOYO] It's fine, we
were able to nail it!
[AKAASHI] Bokuto... What they
did was different

167
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,789
[TOBIO] It's not
all right! It's not!
[AKAASHI]
from what they've been

168
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:54,995
[SHOYO] Hey, let's do it again!
[TOBIO] Oh you think so, huh?
[TAKEDA]
Yes that's it...

169
00:10:15,616 --> 00:10:17,283
[SHOYO]
The ball comes...

170
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:20,787
[SHOYO]
...and then... it stops.

171
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:29,530
(SHOYO & TOBIO power yelling)

172
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:32,265
[KEISHIN]
Oh yeah!

173
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:35,368
[TADASHI] Yeah!
[YU] What was that set you did
just now?! That was amazing!

174
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,203
[KOSHI]
Nice, Hinata, Kageyama!

175
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:41,474
[BOKUTO]
Hey Akaashi... was that freakin
awesome or what? Can we do that?

176
00:10:41,575 --> 00:10:45,411
[AKAASHI]
I dunno... I think it's probably
more complicated than it looks.

177
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,014
[BOKUTO] Ohh...
[AKAASHI] Hinata is hitting it
naturally. Like it's nothing.

178
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:53,086
[AKAASHI]
But, that set looks like it's
really hard to hit unless you're
used to it. And besides...

179
00:10:53,186 --> 00:10:55,088
[AKAASHI]
It would take a miracle
for me to just float

180
00:10:55,188 --> 00:10:58,491
and stop the ball at the
point‐of‐impact like that.

181
00:10:58,592 --> 00:11:00,527
[SHOYO]
We doing this?

182
00:11:00,627 --> 00:11:03,997
[SHOYO] What? Why're you
looking at me like that?
You wanna fight?
[TOBIO, internal]

183
00:11:04,097 --> 00:11:08,168
[SHOYO]
But that was incredible! It was
awesome! It totally stopped
right in front of my eyes!

184
00:11:08,268 --> 00:11:11,337
Like, schwing! This time I felt
like it was totally gonna work
and stuff!

185
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:14,440
But to be honest, when it just
stops in front of me, it kinda
freaks me out!

186
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,277
You really are amazing,
Kageyama!

187
00:11:17,377 --> 00:11:20,914
[TOBIO]
(disgust) You...
You're an idiot...

188
00:11:21,014 --> 00:11:22,749
[SHOYO]
Amazing! Stupendous! (laughing)

189
00:11:22,849 --> 00:11:26,486
[DAICHI]
You seeing this? Not
sure what to make of
Kageyama's expression.

190
00:11:26,587 --> 00:11:28,722
[RYUNOSUKE] What's going on
with his face muscles?
[TOBIO] Shut up!

191
00:11:28,822 --> 00:11:33,393
[ASAHI]
It's not very often that Hinata
gives Kageyama some straight‐up
praise.

192
00:11:33,493 --> 00:11:36,129
[ASAHI] Good thing we had
faith and waited for them.
[DAICHI] Yeah.

193
00:11:36,229 --> 00:11:38,865
[TOBIO] In any case,
next time, we need to‐
[HITOKA] You did it!

194
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:45,839
[HITOKA]
You did it! You did it! Nice
kill, you guys! That was
absolutely great! (happiness)

195
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:48,408
[HITOKA, internal]
Finally. It's been
a long three weeks.

196
00:11:48,509 --> 00:11:52,579
[HITOKA]
Ever since their fight, Hinata
and Kageyama weren't on speaking
terms.

197
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:55,649
[HITOKA]
Nonetheless, the two of them
earnestly tackled the tasks

198
00:11:55,749 --> 00:11:58,685
they each were assigned
to do. And now...

199
00:11:58,785 --> 00:12:01,922
[HITOKA]
...the two of them
are back in business!

200
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:05,992
(HITOKA overwhelmed with
happiness, giggling)

201
00:12:06,092 --> 00:12:11,331
[SHOYO]
(shaken breathing) One more
time!

202
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:13,667
[RYUNOSUKE]
I'm getting jealous!

203
00:12:13,767 --> 00:12:15,068
Let me land something too!

204
00:12:15,168 --> 00:12:16,469
[DAICHI]
We are not gonna lose.

205
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:17,671
[ASAHI]
No that'll be them.

206
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:19,573
Hey, hey, hey!

207
00:12:19,673 --> 00:12:21,474
Don't get swallowed
up by them, guys!

208
00:12:21,575 --> 00:12:23,810
[BOKUTO] Hey, hey, hey!
[SHOYO] All right! Let's keep
going!

209
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:26,112
[KENMA] That Shoyo...
[KUROO] Hmm?

210
00:12:26,212 --> 00:12:28,481
[KENMA]
He's so full of surprises.

211
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,786
[KUROO]
Hm? I bet if the Shorty were
playing on our team...

212
00:12:32,886 --> 00:12:35,021
Then perhaps you would
be a lot more motivated.

213
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:37,423
[KENMA]
I couldn't be on a team
with a guy like that.

214
00:12:37,524 --> 00:12:39,459
[KUROO]
Huh? How come?

215
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,630
[KENMA]
I wouldn't be able to keep up
with him unless I was constantly
improving.

216
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:46,366
[KENMA]
No matter how smart I was about
ditching practice,

217
00:12:46,466 --> 00:12:48,268
he'd notice the difference.

218
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:51,872
[KENMA]
Even that genius first‐year hit
a plateau for a second,

219
00:12:51,972 --> 00:12:53,640
and Shoyo called him on it.

220
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:55,509
[KENMA]
That'd be exhausting.

221
00:12:55,609 --> 00:12:58,712
[KUROO]
Hmmm.

222
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:02,248
[KUROO]
Okay well, if Shorty was there
as a practice partner or
something...

223
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:04,751
THEN you think you'd
be more motivated?

224
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:06,219
[KENMA]
(refreshed) Wait, what?

225
00:13:06,319 --> 00:13:08,421
[KUROO]
I'm just saying, when you watch
him play,

226
00:13:08,522 --> 00:13:10,390
[KUROO]
you make a face like you just
bought a new game

227
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,458
and you're about to start
playing it, you know?

228
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:14,795
(KENMA shocked)
(long whistle)

229
00:13:14,895 --> 00:13:18,498
[KENMA]
You're crazy. I'm not making a
face. What kinda face are you
talking about?

230
00:13:18,599 --> 00:13:19,933
[KUROO]
A face of anticipation.

231
00:13:20,033 --> 00:13:22,002
[KENMA]
Oh whatever. I don't
get you at all.

232
00:13:22,102 --> 00:13:23,103
I don't look like that.

233
00:13:23,203 --> 00:13:24,470
[KUROO] Do too.
[KENMA] Do not.

234
00:13:24,571 --> 00:13:27,273
[KUROO] ...Do too. ...Do too.
[KENMA] Do not.

235
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:31,745
[TAKEDA] Um...
lemme ask you coach.
[KEISHIN] Hmm?

236
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:33,680
[TAKEDA]
I have to admit, at first
glance...

237
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,217
I can't tell the difference
between this attack and the
old one from before.

238
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:40,253
[KEISHIN]
Ahh. The previous
quick attack used a set

239
00:13:40,353 --> 00:13:43,724
that passed through Hinata's
impact point with a lot of
velocity.

240
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:46,359
[KEISHIN]
Meanwhile, the new quick attack
is lofted in order make it

241
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:51,665
[KEISHIN]
so that the spiker's highest
impact point equals the highest
point of the ball's trajectory.

242
00:13:51,765 --> 00:13:56,102
[KEISHIN]
At the moment where the ball
begins to slow and starts to
fall downward,

243
00:13:56,202 --> 00:14:01,274
[KEISHIN]
there is a brief moment to where
the ball just sits there instead
of blazing through.

244
00:14:01,374 --> 00:14:04,277
[KEISHIN]
And that brief moment makes all
the difference.

245
00:14:04,377 --> 00:14:07,013
It gives Hinata more
options before the hit.

246
00:14:07,113 --> 00:14:10,150
(TAKEDA amazed)
(KEISHIN snickering)

247
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:14,254
I gotta bring the old man to the
Spring National preliminaries.

248
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:17,624
And show him our new trick...
live and in person!

249
00:14:19,526 --> 00:14:21,027
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice receive!

250
00:14:21,127 --> 00:14:25,031
[TOBIO]
Kill the momentum of
the ball... Kill it...

251
00:14:32,405 --> 00:14:35,609
[TOBIO, internal]
AAgh! It looked like it was the
same as earlier!

252
00:14:35,709 --> 00:14:38,344
(KEISHIN & TAKEDA speechless)
(whistle)
(FUKURODANI celebration)

253
00:14:38,444 --> 00:14:42,082
[TAKEDA]
That's too bad... I guess he
lost whatever

254
00:14:42,182 --> 00:14:44,818
intense concentration
he had built up before.

255
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:46,920
[SHOYO]
Shake it off. Take it easy!

256
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,522
[TOBIO]
That pisses me off! (angry)

257
00:14:48,622 --> 00:14:51,291
[SHOYO]
Oh chill out! What else
can you do at this point?

258
00:14:51,391 --> 00:14:55,195
[ASAHI]
Well, it's not something that
will go all that perfectly in
the first place...

259
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:57,197
[DAICHI]
You know what time it is.

260
00:14:57,297 --> 00:14:59,432
[RYUNOSUKE]
It's time for the upperclassmen!

261
00:15:00,867 --> 00:15:02,636
[KONOHA]
Single block!

262
00:15:02,736 --> 00:15:04,137
[SHOYO]
One‐touch!

263
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:06,907
[YU]
Got it!

264
00:15:07,007 --> 00:15:08,208
(WASHIO & BOKUTO surprised)

265
00:15:11,411 --> 00:15:13,780
(KOMI shock)
[KOSHI] It came off
the deflection!

266
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:18,084
And Nishinoya came from behind
the line! Which means, from the
libero's set...

267
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:22,455
[KOSHI]
The ace's attack is coming from
the back row!

268
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:27,728
[TAKEDA]
Gear number two. Nice job, guys!

269
00:15:27,828 --> 00:15:29,530
(KOMI gasp)
(whistle)

270
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:32,198
[KOSHI] No it was out! Close!
(growl) (TADASHI disappointed)

271
00:15:32,298 --> 00:15:35,636
[YU]
I'm sorry, the ball was too
freakin' low, dammit!

272
00:15:35,736 --> 00:15:39,973
[ASAHI]
No no... I‐it was great! I think
that was more my mistake there.

273
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:44,745
[YU] Look if it's not good,
you gotta say that it's not
good, Asahi!
[ASAHI] Oh, sure...

274
00:15:44,845 --> 00:15:49,182
[ASAHI] Uh it'd make me really
happy if it was a bit higher
next time.
[KOMI]

275
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:50,684
[YU]
Yes! I know! Thank you!

276
00:15:50,784 --> 00:15:53,053
[KEISHIN]
That's great you guys!
Now don't let up!

277
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:54,855
(DAICHI agreeing nod)

278
00:15:54,955 --> 00:15:58,559
[DAICHI, internal]
If we're too cautious, we won't
have the raw strength

279
00:15:58,659 --> 00:16:02,228
to go toe‐to‐toe with
the powerhouse schools.

280
00:16:02,328 --> 00:16:04,164
[KOMI] Got it!
[RYUNOSUKE] Left, left!

281
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,567
[DAICHI, internal]
In order for our team
to be successful...

282
00:16:06,667 --> 00:16:08,935
[TADASHI] Chance ball!
[SHOYO] It's a free ball!
[DAICHI]
Even if we don't stack up

283
00:16:09,035 --> 00:16:10,537
[YU]
It's mine!

284
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:13,774
[DAICHI]
We will need to hone and
perfect our new weapons!

285
00:16:13,874 --> 00:16:15,709
[DAICHI]
This is it!

286
00:16:15,809 --> 00:16:18,378
[DAICHI, internal]
Multiple spikers from
multiple directions

287
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:21,147
need to simultaneously
start their approach!

288
00:16:21,247 --> 00:16:23,750
[DAICHI, internal]
A synchronized attack
at First Tempo!

289
00:16:23,850 --> 00:16:27,020
[DAICHI, internal]
Do not allow their blockers
to narrow in on a target!

290
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,157
[DAICHI]
Everyone has to plunge‐in
believing that the ball will
come to them!

291
00:16:31,257 --> 00:16:34,327
(RYUNOSUKE winding up)

292
00:16:35,261 --> 00:16:36,262
(HITOKA & KIYOKO gasp)

293
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:37,564
(KEISHIN & TAKEDA gawk)

294
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:39,099
(BOKUTO shocked)

295
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:40,500
(whistle)

296
00:16:40,934 --> 00:16:42,536
Right on!

297
00:16:42,636 --> 00:16:45,706
[RYUNOSUKE]
Me do a good spike...
Me so happy feels...

298
00:16:45,806 --> 00:16:48,842
[YU] All right! (laughing)
[KEI] He's crying...
[ASAHI] I think he
forgot how to talk...

299
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:51,912
[RYUNOSUKE]
I dunno, it's just been a while
since it felt this good to nail
one.

300
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:56,316
What the Hell, these guys're
attacking from all over the
place.

301
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:57,851
[DAICHI]
Well done Kageyama!

302
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,185
[TOBIO]
Thanks!

303
00:16:59,285 --> 00:17:00,286
[TAKEDA]
Nice kill, Tanaka!

304
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,923
[RYUNOSUKE]
Thank you!

305
00:17:03,023 --> 00:17:04,958
Always full of surprises...
Aren'tcha...

306
00:17:05,058 --> 00:17:06,192
[YAKU]
Don't look away!

307
00:17:06,292 --> 00:17:07,661
[TAKEDA]
Gear number three!

308
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:09,696
[TADASHI]
There was the synchronized
attack.

309
00:17:09,796 --> 00:17:12,899
They were able to execute the
set and spike from First Tempo.

310
00:17:12,999 --> 00:17:15,235
They totally nailed
it didn't they?!

311
00:17:15,335 --> 00:17:17,538
[KOSHI]
As opposed to their
triple‐block,

312
00:17:17,638 --> 00:17:19,940
our attack had four
people, including the
attack from the back.

313
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,409
[KOSHI]
They can't possibly keep their
eyes on everyone. Hmm...

314
00:17:25,512 --> 00:17:27,180
[TADASHI]
Hm? Is there
something wrong, Suga?

315
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:28,715
[KOSHI]
Well...

316
00:17:28,815 --> 00:17:31,518
I think there's something I
want us to try out now.

317
00:17:31,618 --> 00:17:32,786
(whistle)

318
00:17:42,996 --> 00:17:44,397
[BOKUTO]
Dammit!

319
00:17:49,102 --> 00:17:50,904
(KURASUNO celebrates)

320
00:17:51,004 --> 00:17:53,106
[ASHIYA]
Oh man, Karasuno is on a roll.

321
00:17:53,206 --> 00:17:54,608
[YUKAWA]
Now they're starting
to land the attacks

322
00:17:54,708 --> 00:17:57,110
that were sluggish during
the first day of training.

323
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,545
(long whistle)

324
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,313
(KURASUNO celebrates)

325
00:18:01,281 --> 00:18:03,116
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

326
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,986
Finished off a set against
Fukurodani all tied up!

327
00:18:06,086 --> 00:18:07,120
[YU]
Yeah!

328
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:08,755
But don't celebrate just yet.

329
00:18:08,855 --> 00:18:09,956
Tough part's comin'.

330
00:18:10,056 --> 00:18:11,224
[ALL]
Yessir!

331
00:18:11,324 --> 00:18:13,293
Now you should never
let your guard down.

332
00:18:13,393 --> 00:18:16,229
But... be aware that everything
you've been working on...

333
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:18,231
is starting to come together!

334
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,534
[TAKEDA]
So in the course of
battling out this set,

335
00:18:20,634 --> 00:18:22,803
remember what you've got
and keep it going!

336
00:18:22,903 --> 00:18:24,404
[ALL]
Yessir!

337
00:18:24,505 --> 00:18:26,807
[KEISHIN]
And this time, just like we
planned,

338
00:18:26,907 --> 00:18:30,777
[KEISHIN]
we haven't been letting their
ace player land spikes and boost
their morale.

339
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:35,549
[KEISHIN]
Well, aside from that one
ridiculous cut shot.

340
00:18:35,649 --> 00:18:38,251
[KEISHIN]
That is all thanks to you
getting the one‐touches!

341
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:40,220
[KEI]
Oh... thanks.

342
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,123
If we keep No.4 under control,
we can take it home...

343
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,090
Now let's do this!

344
00:18:44,190 --> 00:18:46,126
[ALL]
Yeah!

345
00:18:46,226 --> 00:18:47,628
[AKAASHI]
I know things are looking
rough...

346
00:18:47,728 --> 00:18:49,863
but look we need to stay calm
and not get distracted

347
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:52,332
by the wide variety of
Karasuno's offensive tactics.

348
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,268
[KOMI] Yeah!
[ONAGA] Yessir!

349
00:18:55,368 --> 00:18:57,504
[AKAASHI]
Bokuto? Are you listening
to this or what?

350
00:18:57,604 --> 00:18:59,472
[BOKUTO]
Yeah! Course I'm listening!

351
00:18:59,573 --> 00:19:02,876
[BOKUTO]
Come on, let's get this thing
started! I'm pissed

352
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:06,246
[YUKIE]
Something's going on there.

353
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:07,814
(AKAASHI sigh)

354
00:19:10,751 --> 00:19:13,787
(practice games)

355
00:19:15,455 --> 00:19:17,891
(whistle)
(FUKURODANI celebrates)

356
00:19:17,991 --> 00:19:21,928
[YU]
Dammit, sorry about that!
That was our chance to turn
the tables!

357
00:19:22,028 --> 00:19:23,263
[DAICHI]
Nah, don't sweat it!

358
00:19:23,363 --> 00:19:24,631
[RYUNOSUKE]
Nice fightin', Noya!

359
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:27,834
All right, this serve is
gonna finish 'em off!

360
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:30,771
[SARUKUI]
You got this, Bokuto!

361
00:19:30,871 --> 00:19:33,073
[AKAASHI]
Come on Bokuto... we need to
stay calm here.

362
00:19:33,173 --> 00:19:34,374
[BOKUTO]
I AM calm!

363
00:19:34,474 --> 00:19:37,210
Crap, Bokuto's starting
to get fired up...

364
00:19:38,144 --> 00:19:40,581
All right, punks! Here ya go!

365
00:19:42,649 --> 00:19:44,150
(KONOHA startled)
(whistle)

366
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:46,319
[BOKUTO]
Aw crap, that was so stupid!

367
00:19:46,419 --> 00:19:49,122
[BOKUTO]
Sorry guys I don't know what the
hell is wrong with me! (wailing)
[KOMI] Why don't

368
00:19:49,222 --> 00:19:52,025
[UBUGAWA A]
Hey look at that now Karasuno's
caught back up again.

369
00:19:52,125 --> 00:19:56,096
[UBUGAWA B]
Yeah... will there be a huge
upset at the very end here?

370
00:19:56,196 --> 00:19:58,498
[DAICHI]
Their No.4 makes shots
from anywhere.

371
00:19:58,599 --> 00:20:01,434
[DAICHI]
Let's aim for him and put him in
check for a little bit.

372
00:20:01,535 --> 00:20:02,936
[RYUNOSUKE]
Yessir!

373
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:05,806
(whistle)

374
00:20:05,906 --> 00:20:07,974
[RYUNOSUKE, internal]
Crap! I aimed for the corner a
bit too much!

375
00:20:08,074 --> 00:20:09,510
[BOKUTO]
I got it.

376
00:20:09,610 --> 00:20:11,912
[RYUNOSUKE]
Whoa, that was lucky! Heh.

377
00:20:12,012 --> 00:20:16,550
[BOKUTO]
Give the ball to me! I'll stop
their run right here and now!

378
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:21,221
[AKAASHI, internal]
When I send the ball to
Bokuto... and he's a bit too
overzealous...

379
00:20:21,321 --> 00:20:24,457
[AKAASHI, internal]
A: He lands it like normal.
[BOKUTO] All right!

380
00:20:24,558 --> 00:20:26,727
[AKAASHI, internal]
Or B: He misses or gets stuffed.

381
00:20:26,827 --> 00:20:30,196
[AKAASHI, internal]
And that increases the chance
for his spirits to get
completely crushed.

382
00:20:30,296 --> 00:20:32,198
Then he's no good to us.

383
00:20:32,298 --> 00:20:35,636
[AKAASHI, internal] Or C: He
doesn't get a set at all.
[BOKUTO] I don't care anymore!

384
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:37,403
[AKAASHI, internal]
Which means he'll get all pouty.

385
00:20:37,504 --> 00:20:39,706
[AKAASHI, internal]
And that's pretty annoying.

386
00:20:40,373 --> 00:20:42,075
[AKAASHI]
Here, Bokuto!

387
00:20:42,175 --> 00:20:43,109
[SARUKUI]
Triple block!

388
00:20:43,209 --> 00:20:44,711
[BOKUTO]
Bring it!

389
00:20:46,146 --> 00:20:47,648
[KOMI]
Got it!

390
00:20:47,748 --> 00:20:49,015
[BOKUTO]
One more time, Akaashi!

391
00:20:49,115 --> 00:20:50,984
(annoyed) This one's all you!

392
00:20:51,084 --> 00:20:52,318
[BOKUTO]
This one's is it!

393
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:53,987
This time, we'll make
sure to stop him guys!

394
00:20:54,087 --> 00:20:55,556
[ASAHI] Now!
[DAICHI] Now...!

395
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:57,257
[SHOYO]
Oh?

396
00:20:57,357 --> 00:20:58,892
(AKAASHI speechless)

397
00:21:01,394 --> 00:21:03,296
(whistle)
[KURASUNO]
All right! Yeah!

398
00:21:03,396 --> 00:21:05,365
[UBUGAWA A]
Now Karasuno's flipped
the game around!

399
00:21:05,465 --> 00:21:09,202
And I'm pretty sure this the
first time Karasuno has been in
the lead all week long.

400
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,537
[UBUGAWA B]
Yeah, maybe so!

401
00:21:10,637 --> 00:21:13,273
Um was that a block they
just did over there?

402
00:21:13,373 --> 00:21:15,676
[KIYOKO]
Not quite...
It didn't clear the net...

403
00:21:15,776 --> 00:21:20,446
Whenever that happens...
it's just called a missed spike.

404
00:21:20,547 --> 00:21:22,783
(BOKUTO heavy breathing)

405
00:21:26,086 --> 00:21:27,788
[KONOHA, internal]
Ugh... Oh no...

406
00:21:27,888 --> 00:21:29,523
[SARUKUI, internal]
Oh, it's time for that?

407
00:21:29,623 --> 00:21:31,692
[KOMI, internal]
You're kidding me, isn't it
early?

408
00:21:31,792 --> 00:21:33,193
[ONAGA, internal]
Really, already?

409
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:34,595
[WASHIO, internal]
That was fast...

410
00:21:34,695 --> 00:21:36,897
[AKAASHI, internal]
Oh, here it comes...

411
00:21:36,997 --> 00:21:38,765
[BOKUTO]
Akaashi....

412
00:21:41,034 --> 00:21:43,203
[BOKUTO]
Don't send it to me anymore
today!

413
00:21:43,303 --> 00:21:46,507
[SARUKUI, KOMI, WASHIO, &
KONOHA, internal] (sigh) Now
he's in sad mode...

414
00:21:46,607 --> 00:21:47,908
[DAICHI]
Hmm? What's this?

415
00:21:48,008 --> 00:21:52,045
[AKAASHI] (sigh) All right.
(BOKUTO whimper)

416
00:21:52,145 --> 00:21:56,416
[AKAASHI]
But while I'm not sending any
sets to you... please try to
chill out.

417
00:21:58,051 --> 00:21:59,786
[TAKEDA]
You think this could be
our chance, Coach?

418
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:02,122
[KEISHIN]
Yeah, we can take this set!

419
00:22:02,222 --> 00:22:03,757
[DAICHI]
This is our chance guys.

420
00:22:03,857 --> 00:22:06,793
It looks like their ace is off
his game, let's keep after 'em!

421
00:22:06,893 --> 00:22:07,994
[KURASUNO]
Yeah!

422
00:22:08,094 --> 00:22:09,429
[TOBIO]
Hinata...

423
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,364
we're gonna use that
quick‐attack again.

424
00:22:11,464 --> 00:22:15,869
I'll give you the set you
want, so trust me. And fly!

425
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:17,938
[SHOYO]
Yeah! Heh.

426
00:22:18,038 --> 00:22:19,873
[SHOYO, internal]
With this new weapon...

427
00:22:19,973 --> 00:22:23,944
[SHOYO]
We can do it. We will win
against Fukurodani!

428
00:23:55,636 --> 00:23:57,904
[SHOYO]
It looks like we can
finally beat Fukurodani!

429
00:23:58,004 --> 00:24:00,741
[TOBIO]
Their ace was telling them
not to set for him anymore.

430
00:24:00,841 --> 00:24:02,676
[SHOYO]
Wait, does the winner
get to eat more meat?

431
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:05,311
[SHOYO]
And if so, does the loser get
stuck with vegetables?!

432
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,581
[TOBIO]
We absolutely MUST
win this game!

433
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,816
[SHOYO]
Next Haikyu!! "Above".
