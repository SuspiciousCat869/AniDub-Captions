I think you should
keep it up here.

She's the only person I know
who could learn by cleaning.

162
00:09:06,583 --> 00:09:08,666
She is learning a lot that way.

163
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,541
Do you think that because
of what she told you

164
00:09:10,625 --> 00:09:11,583
about the enel stuff?

165
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:12,708
[RYU]
Yes.

166
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:13,958
[OBI]
Mm...

167
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:17,125
Well, see ya.

168
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:19,375
Oh. Hold on a sec.

169
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:23,875
[RYU]
Oh!

[OBI chuckles]

171
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,750
[OBI]
Hm?

172
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,708
These are seeds of
the orbia flower.

173
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,083
From my personal supply.
They're for you.

174
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,250
Are you serious?

175
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:41,083
Yes, for helping me
get the paper.

176
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,541
[ZEN]
Excuse me, Chief.

177
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:50,666
Prince Zen.

178
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:53,083
How may I help you?
Are you all right?

179
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,750
I'm fine. I've just got
a measly paper cut.

180
00:09:55,833 --> 00:09:57,041
[HIGATA]
Uh!

181
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,666
You've caught us in the middle
of our semi-annual cleaning.

182
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,333
[ZEN]
I see.

183
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:05,750
If you're looking for Shirayuki,

184
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:07,166
she's in the storage area.

185
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:08,708
[ZEN grunts]

186
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,333
I can take a look at it, though.
Paper cuts are dangerous.

187
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:13,583
You wouldn't want to turn into
a paper person, would you?

188
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,375
Did Mitsuhide tell you
to say that?!

189
00:10:15,458 --> 00:10:17,208
[GARAK]
Wouldn't you like to know?

190
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,541
Here, let's clean that up,

191
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,541
and then if you want you
can wait in the bunk room.

192
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:23,750
Thanks. I really appreciate it.

193
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,750
Next!

194
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:44,375
[YATSUFUSA] Chief Garak. We're
finally finished cleaning.

195
00:10:44,458 --> 00:10:47,250
Oh, that's good
to hear. Nice job!

196
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:49,041
And thank you for
working so hard.

197
00:10:49,125 --> 00:10:50,625
You're all done
for the day, guys.

198
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:53,000
Oh! Shirayuki, there's a
visitor waiting for you

199
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:53,958
in the bunk room.

200
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,875
What? A visitor?

201
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,791
Um, Zen...?

202
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,500
Must be tired.

203
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:07,833
[ZEN] Together, we can
weather the storms.

You give me that faith.

00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:13,666
I swear I will protect you and
what we have with my life.

[SHIRAYUKI gasping]

I've been wanting
to talk with you

00:11:34,833 --> 00:11:37,583
about what the future
holds for us.

Shirayuki, it's me, Mitsuhide.

215
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,541
May I come in?

216
00:11:43,625 --> 00:11:44,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh, yes!

217
00:11:44,958 --> 00:11:46,750
[yawns]

218
00:11:46,833 --> 00:11:48,208
[MITSUHIDE]
I suppose I should have known

219
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,791
why you didn't return sooner.

220
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:52,375
[ZEN] Sorry, I didn't realize
how exhausted I was.

221
00:11:52,458 --> 00:11:53,916
Don't worry about it.

222
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,125
If you need to sleep a little
longer, I think you should.

223
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:58,833
[ZEN]
Right. Good idea.

224
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,666
Did you forget something?

225
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,583
Just wanted to see
your face again.

[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

227
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:11,333
[ZEN]
See ya.

228
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
My heart...

229
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:21,375
I feel like it could beat
right out of my chest.

230
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
What the future holds for us.

231
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:54,000
[bell tolls]

232
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,666

[ZEN gasps]

234
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,041
Obi!

235
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,625
You shouldn't lounge around
in someone else's room!

236
00:13:02,708 --> 00:13:03,583
As I recall,

237
00:13:03,666 --> 00:13:05,041
my position here is messenger

238
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,666
to the second prince
of Clarines.

239
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,625
If the prince doesn't
give me any work,

240
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:11,708
it means I can do
what I want, right?

241
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,875
[OBI]
Uh?

242
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:15,875
Pretty. Did you get
this from Shirayuki?

243
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,083
[OBI]
Uh. No, it was a gift from Ryu.

244
00:13:18,166 --> 00:13:21,166
You don't have any trouble
making friends with people, huh?

245
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,333
Except Kiki.

246
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:24,458
[laughs]

247
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:25,791
Uh.

248
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:27,000
[ZEN] I heard Shirayuki's
trying to collect those

249
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,541
in all the different
flowering colors.

250
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,625
The seeds don't indicate the
color of the petals, though,

251
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:31,625
so it's hard.

252
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,166
She wants as many
as she can get.

253
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,833
[OBI]
Huh.

254
00:13:34,916 --> 00:13:36,333
[AIDE A]
Excuse me.

255
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,166
[door opens]

256
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,166
[AIDE A] Prince Izana,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

257
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,875
but we've just received
correspondence from Tanbarun.

258
00:13:52,083 --> 00:13:55,416
Oh? Interesting.

259
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,791
[OBI]
Half-Pint.

260
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,333
[RYU]
Mm?

261
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,041
These seeds. Take 'em back.

262
00:14:07,125 --> 00:14:08,375
What for?

263
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:10,750
I've never grown flowers
from seed like this,

264
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,625
and I don't know how much longer
I'm gonna be in the castle.

265
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:17,208
So I think you should take them
and grow them for yourself.

266
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,625
Well, I think all that means

267
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,583
it's better for you
to have them.

268
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,416
Uh. What do you mean?

269
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:24,541
Nothing.

270
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,208
The seeds are pretty
just as they are,

271
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:28,625
and when you plant them,
they grow without much effort.

272
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,041
So when you leave here and
get where you might stay,

273
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,750
you can just plant them there.

274
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ryu!

275
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:39,791
Oh, good, I was hoping that
I would find you here!

276
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,583
I didn't expect
to see you, Obi.

277
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,083
Surprise.

278
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,958
[SHIRAYUKI] Cleaning the lab
took longer than I thought,

279
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,708
and I couldn't find
you when I was done,

280
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,500
so I started to get worried.

281
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:50,833
But since you're with Obi,
there's no cause for concern.

282
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:53,958
[OBI gasps]
The flowers.

283
00:14:54,041 --> 00:14:55,625
Did they all fall
off or something?

284
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:58,416
No. I finished collecting
all the seeds I needed,

285
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,125
so I pruned them.
That's removing the blooms.

286
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:03,666
It'll help the plant
live a lot longer.

287
00:15:03,750 --> 00:15:05,041
I heard about your quest.

288
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,041
Have you found all the
different colors, yet?

289
00:15:07,125 --> 00:15:08,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Almost. I'm just missing blue.

290
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,083
[OBI]
Uh.

291
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,166
Oh, well.

292
00:15:11,250 --> 00:15:14,000
I'll just have to wait
until next year.

293
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,041
I'd like to see them
when you've got them all.

294
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

295
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,166
Uh.

296
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,958
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki!

297
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?! Mihaya?

298
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:32,333
[ZEN]
Yes. He wants to speak with us.

299
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,125
That is, you and
me, specifically.

300
00:15:35,208 --> 00:15:38,166
But I'm sure you'd
rather not see him.

301
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:41,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
I can't disagree.

302
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,750
Wait. Is that the
former noble guy

303
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:45,083
who kidnapped Shirayuki
a while back?

304
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,916
He's a good-for-nothing
scoundrel!

305
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,958
[OBI] I've never seen Zen
react like this before.

306
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,041
Mihaya is an enemy.

307
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:54,166
What could he possibly
want with us?

308
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:55,833
And I thought he was in jail.

309
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,166
[ZEN]
From what I know,

310
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,041
he wants to discuss something
that involves you.

311
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,916
Well, that's odd.

312
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,125
What do you say?

313
00:16:05,500 --> 00:16:06,666
I'll see him.

314
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:07,833
Hello.

315
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,875
It's been a while,
hasn't it, Rosylocks?

316
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,875
[yelps]

317
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:13,291
Dispense with the small talk

318
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,708
and tell us why the
hell you're here!

319
00:16:15,791 --> 00:16:18,625
Well, this might seem
a little strange, Red.

Yes, Majesty.

You gave him information

I'm not exactly asking for
anything for telling you this,
