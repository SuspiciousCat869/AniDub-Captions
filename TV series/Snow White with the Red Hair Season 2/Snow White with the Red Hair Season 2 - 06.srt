1
00:00:07,875 --> 00:00:09,125
Shirayuki!

2
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:10,541
Found you!

3
00:00:11,666 --> 00:00:13,083
Let go of me!

4
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,250
[OBI groans]

5
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:15,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi!

6
00:00:15,208 --> 00:00:16,458
Obi!

7
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:20,125
[KAZUKI] I'm taking you to
where you truly belong.

8
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:22,750
Pops is gonna be so happy.

9
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,875
Good. So you're awake.

10
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,875
[KAZUKI]
What the...?!

11
00:00:26,958 --> 00:00:28,208
Umihebi?!

12
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,458
[rustling]

13
00:00:29,541 --> 00:00:31,083
[KAZUKI] After we took
you out of the castle,

14
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:33,375
you and I were attacked by
one of those evil woman's

15
00:00:33,458 --> 00:00:36,000
companions when we
were by ourselves.

16
00:00:36,083 --> 00:00:38,041
So in other words,
you're saying

17
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,625
I was kidnapped
from my kidnappers?

18
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:42,333
I'm so sorry,

19
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,500
but you won't be able
to go back home anymore.

20
00:00:45,583 --> 00:00:47,125
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

21
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:21,000
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

22
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Huh?

23
00:02:22,083 --> 00:02:24,083
Do you maybe wanna
sneak into town?

24
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:24,750
What?

25
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,083
Like right now?

26
00:02:26,166 --> 00:02:27,750
Well, that sounds fun, too.

27
00:02:27,833 --> 00:02:29,875
But you are leaving
for Tanbarun tomorrow.

28
00:02:29,958 --> 00:02:32,666
I think we might get in
trouble if we went tonight.

29
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,708
That's true.

30
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:39,750
We'll go when you get
back from your trip.

31
00:02:39,833 --> 00:02:41,000
Just us.

32
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:46,250
[SHIRAYUKI] That moment
feels like a lifetime ago.

33
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:50,416
I haven't heard Zen's voice in
what seems like an eternity.

34
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,125
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

35
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,416
[KAZUKI]
Now's our chance.

36
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,625
We have to get out
before things get worse.

37
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,833
Shirayuki. Can you do this?

38
00:02:57,916 --> 00:03:00,083
I know it's scary.

39
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:02,000
I can!

40
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,041
Whoa, what are you doing?!

41
00:03:07,125 --> 00:03:09,375
[SHIRAYUKI] Would you want to
wear this during an escape?

42
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,416
[KAZUKI]
Uh.

43
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:15,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
I have to be strong.

44
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,416
[SHIRAYUKI] Kazuki, let me
have a look at your face.

45
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:18,958
[gasps] Why?

46
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,541
It's nothing.

47
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,000
We need to treat it before the
swelling gets any worse, okay?

48
00:03:23,083 --> 00:03:24,666
[KAZUKI]
I, uh...

49
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:26,875
Nah, We'll do it later.

50
00:03:33,958 --> 00:03:35,958
[KAZUKI] Damn it!
We're already on the boat.

51
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:36,833
I was afraid of that.

52
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,041
Now what?

53
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:39,416
There's not a lot of movement,

54
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,875
so the ship must be anchored.

55
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,750
With any luck, we're
still close to the shore.

56
00:03:43,833 --> 00:03:47,041
[KAZUKI grunting]
She locked it,

57
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,208
so we're not going to be
able to sneak up on deck.

58
00:03:49,291 --> 00:03:51,416
Knowing her, there're
probably guards, anyway.

59
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,625
Got any ideas?

60
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:54,875
[gasps]

61
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:03,916
It's a Chitoka seed!

62
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think I've got a plan.

63
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,625
Why do we get stuck
guarding these two brats

64
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,875
when we could be ashore,
having some fun?

65
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,125
[yawns]

66
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,916
[PIRATE B]
Quit complaining.

67
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,083
If you want to go, go.

68
00:04:17,166 --> 00:04:19,166
You'll get beat senseless,
but who cares.

69
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,833
Uh?! Hey, look!

70
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,250
[PIRATE A gasping]

71
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:23,083
Come on!

72
00:04:23,166 --> 00:04:24,166
[PIRATE A yelps]

73
00:04:24,958 --> 00:04:29,375
[PIRATES coughing]

74
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:32,833
[PIRATE B]
Did those kids set a fire?!

75
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:34,333
[PIRATE A]
I can't see anything!

76
00:04:34,416 --> 00:04:35,666
Kazuki!

77
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,625
[PIRATE A]
Hey!

78
00:04:36,708 --> 00:04:38,500
[BOTH groan]

79
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:43,833
[KAZUKI]
I can't believe it,

80
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:45,541
your plan worked!

81
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,541
What are those things?

82
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,708
[SHIRAYUKI] Chitoka seeds.
They're a good food source,

83
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:52,750
and they also happen to smoke
a lot when you burn them.

84
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,875
I figured we could use
that to our advantage.

85
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:59,875
Just out of curiosity, what
did you do back in Clarines?

86
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:02,833
I'm an apprentice to the
chief court herbalist.

87
00:05:02,916 --> 00:05:04,500
Fascinating.

88
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,625
Is that what you wanted
to do with your life?

89
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,875
Yes, absolutely.

90
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,416
[KAZUKI]
All right.

91
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:20,041
It looks like the coast
is clear out there.

92
00:05:20,125 --> 00:05:23,125
Now, when you get up on deck,
break left and run.

93
00:05:23,208 --> 00:05:25,708
Then, jump off into the water.

94
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,833
[KAZUKI gasping]

95
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,458
[UMIHEBI] Where are you dears
off to in such a hurry?!

96
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,458
You look like little minnows.

97
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:44,750
Careful, this snake'll
swallow you head first.

98
00:05:51,375 --> 00:05:52,208
Hey!

99
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:54,625
We're almost there.

100
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:14,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen, look!

101
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:16,666
We found this.

102
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,208
[gasps] My watch.

103
00:06:20,291 --> 00:06:22,583
[MITSUHIDE] Apparently, Obi
picked it up at after the fight.

104
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,833
When he went in search of
Shirayuki he left it here.

105
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:30,041
[SHIRAYUKI] I will give it
back to you when I return.

106
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:31,750
[ZEN]
I see.

107
00:06:37,125 --> 00:06:38,125
[ZEN]
Huh?

108
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,458
[MIHAYA]
Uh!

109
00:06:42,541 --> 00:06:44,625
[ZEN]
Ah! What... was that for?

110
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:46,166
It's not that we
don't appreciate you

111
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:48,291
maintaining your composure
throughout all this.

112
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:50,916
But you need to vent some of
your frustration and anger.

113
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,916
If not, you'll
spontaneously combust.

114
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:56,625
Heh.

115
00:06:56,708 --> 00:07:00,333
So you're just helping me
burn off some of the steam?

116
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,791
That's oh, so kind of you.

117
00:07:02,875 --> 00:07:04,958
[MITSUHIDE]
Was it too hard?

118
00:07:05,041 --> 00:07:06,208
[ZEN]
I'll put it this way,

119
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:08,000
you're going straight to
the Punishment Chamber

120
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:09,250
when we get back Mitsuhide.

121
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:12,541
Ah! Why just me?
It was Kiki's idea!

122
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,291
Wise decision, Prince Zen.

123
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:16,500
There is one more thing, though.

124
00:07:16,583 --> 00:07:19,500
Obi left this message for you.

125
00:07:20,708 --> 00:07:21,791
[gasps]

126
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,875
[RAJ] Thank you for waiting.
Ready to go?

127
00:07:23,958 --> 00:07:26,875
The plan is to visit a
self-governing vigilante group.

128
00:07:26,958 --> 00:07:28,208
Although, they prefer
to be called

129
00:07:28,291 --> 00:07:29,458
the Lions of the Mountain,

130
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,125
they're mostly known
for fighting bandits,

131
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:33,208
but they've taken on the
Claw of the Sea before.

132
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,000
Interesting. Hopefully they'll
have useful information.

133
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:39,416
Also, you'll be happy
to hear this.

134
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,250
[RAJ]
What?

135
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,666
I have a promising lead.

136
00:07:45,041 --> 00:07:47,625
[whistle blows]

137
00:08:10,416 --> 00:08:12,708
[MUKAZE] According to Itoya's
account of the ordeal,

138
00:08:12,791 --> 00:08:15,541
the Claw left their mark at
the scene of the disappearance.

139
00:08:15,625 --> 00:08:17,458
They most likely
tracked down Kazuki

140
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,333
and took him back to the ship,
along with the girl.

141
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:23,750
Contact our men in the village!
And prepare the ship.

142
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:25,291
We're going after the Claw!

143
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,125
[MEN]
Yeah!

144
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,333
[MAN A]
Let's move out!

145
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:28,625
What about you?

146
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,875
There's something that
I want to look into.

147
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,833
I'll need your help.

148
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,041
[MUKAZE]
You, over there!

149
00:08:40,125 --> 00:08:41,500
[OBI grunts]

150
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,375
[MUKAZE] Itoya informed me
who you've been working for.

151
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:45,791
Do you intend to tell the
prince about our operations?

152
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:50,083
All you need to know is I'm not
gonna let you out of my sight.

153
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:51,083

[coughs]

157
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,916
I see you're still as cruel
as you've always been!

158
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,500
Those men are your comrades.

159
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,916
Sometimes bad boys
need to be hurt a little.

160
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,375
That way they'll
learn their lesson.

161
00:09:10,458 --> 00:09:13,041
I think they both have

I had Kihal show me
the ropes, first.

I thought we already established

229

that the Claw of the
Sea took Shirayuki.

230

Kazuki took her from the

she was taken again,
with Kazuki.

reason for refusing him.

248
00:12:56,291 --> 00:12:57,958
My understanding was this:

249
00:12:58,041 --> 00:12:59,666
The Lions formed
to fight bandits

violence against Obi?

Kazuki was a slave to the

Itoya!

257

[ITOYA]
After they'd had enough of him,

258
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,750
they sold him to some nobles
who only kept him around

259
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:21,916
because he was pretty.

260
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,875
They treated him
like a living doll.

261
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,250
That's why!

262
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,500
When Kazuki heard Shirayuki's
story, he identified

263
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,750
with an unfortunate girl
who was stolen by a prince

264
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,500
against her will just because
her red hair caught his eye!

265
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,208
He wanted to take her to a place

266
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:37,791
where such fools
couldn't find her.

267

when you told her?

Did she agree to go with you?

You didn't let her have a
say in the matter, did you?

I can tell you're close
with Shirayuki.

275
00:13:57,041 --> 00:13:57,875
That you care.

276
00:13:57,958 --> 00:14:00,333
Yes. I will save her.

[MUKAZE]
The Lions of the Mountain

tired of noble tyranny.

They've been driven from
their homes unjustly.

They're who we are

00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,541
We don't abide by

That's why our people trust us.

But we want to save those

So, since we share
a common goal,

285
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,583
we might as well work together.

Will you agree to let the
rest go and move forward?

287

Well, Raj? Agreed?

288
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:29,250
Uh! Oh, yeah, I guess. Sure.

289
00:14:33,625 --> 00:14:35,750
Then it's a deal.

290
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,625
[ZEN] An entire port town
working for the Claw?

291
00:14:42,708 --> 00:14:44,041
Yes.

292
00:14:44,125 --> 00:14:45,666
We've had our eye on that
place for quite some time.

293
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,750
There's a wharf there,
which is convenient.

294
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,416
I'd say it's definitely
worth checking out.

295
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:51,583

I see.

296
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,875
What's the matter, Mihaya?

297
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,791
I've never seen you so serious.

298
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:57,083
Oh, you know, just feeling
like more of an outsider

299
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:59,750
now than I ever have
before, that's all.

300
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:02,875
Even that stray cat
bastard is in the fold.

301
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,416
But it's fine.

302
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,458
I'll let you know if I have
anything that needs to be said.

303
00:15:06,541 --> 00:15:08,791
Oh, I can't wait!

304
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,583
I don't believe I was
addressing you, you--

305
00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,125
Stray cat bastard?

306
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,500
We'll be at the port town
once we clear this next hill.

307
00:15:16,583 --> 00:15:18,125
Hey, was that your real voice?

308
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:20,625
I think you forgot to use
the scary one this time.

309
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:21,750
[OBI]
Huh?

310
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:29,041
[MUKAZE] That's definitely
one of the Claw's boats.

311
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:31,125
See that ship anchored
at the wharf?

312
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,041
Yeah. I wonder if their
boss lady's on that one.

313
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,666
For the first time ever, I
actually hope that she is.

314
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:39,291
You mean the Claw of the
Sea's leader is a woman?

315
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:41,833
[MUKAZE] Yes, but she's more
like a snake than anything.

316
00:15:41,916 --> 00:15:44,291
Cold, dead eyes with
a heart to match.

317
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,875
She terrifies weak men into
doing whatever she says.

318
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,625
No matter how miserable it might
make them in the long run.

319
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,333
Obi. What'd you find?

320
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,916
Seems we hit the jackpot.

321
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,125
Some guys said they saw

322
00:15:57,208 --> 00:15:59,083
a pretty, blonde boy
around earlier.

323
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:01,083
He was being escorted
onto the Claw ship

324
00:16:01,166 --> 00:16:02,750
that's anchored at the wharf.

325
00:16:02,833 --> 00:16:04,208
Kazuki.

326
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:05,583
[ZEN]
And Shirayuki?

327
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,583
I couldn't find anyone
who had seen her.

328
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,708
Although, just because
they didn't see her

329
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,291
doesn't mean she isn't there.

330
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,041
[ITOYA] In a way, this is
like a hostage situation.

331
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,666
They have the upper hand
if we try to pick a fight.

332
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:18,458
Which makes things difficult.

333
00:16:18,541 --> 00:16:20,250
So then, how do we proceed?

334
00:16:20,333 --> 00:16:21,875
Wait until the crew
goes into town

335
00:16:21,958 --> 00:16:23,625
and sneak them off the ship?

336
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:25,666
[KIKI]
Prince Zen.

337
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,875
I have a proposal that
I think could work.

338
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,208
[PIRATE C]
Huh?

339
00:16:36,291 --> 00:16:41,375
[PIRATE C]
28, 29, 30!

340
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:42,833
You're going to kill him!

341
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:46,125
Please, stop! You don't
have to do this!

342
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:48,625
Fine, pull him up.

343
00:16:48,708 --> 00:16:50,291
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:56,041 --> 00:17:01,791
[KAZUKI coughs, pants]

345
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,833
[UMIHEBI]
Are you just dyin' to talk now?

346
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:05,958
Come on, why do
those silly Lions

347
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:08,708
want that precious Red so badly?

348
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:11,916
I told you. I don't
know anything.

349
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,041
They never let me in on it.

350
00:17:14,125 --> 00:17:16,458
All I overheard is that
it was some kind of job

351
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,958
they were doing.

352
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:20,375
Then, we still haven't convinced
you to stop playing dumb?

353
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,833
I suppose it doesn't matter.

354
00:17:22,916 --> 00:17:25,750
Oh, girlie, why don't we
figure out which master

355
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:27,750
I get to sell you off to?

356
00:17:27,833 --> 00:17:29,916
You stand out so much.

357
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,750
I think I should send you so
far away from your homeland

358
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:36,208
that no one will
ever recognize you.

359
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,583
You can't make me go.
I'm not scared of you.

360
00:17:39,666 --> 00:17:41,416
[PIRATE C]
Boss, you've got a visitor!

361
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:43,125
They wanna make a deal!

362
00:17:43,208 --> 00:17:44,750
Tell 'em she's busy!

363
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,958
[PIRATE C] Uh, looks like
pretty high quality goods!

364
00:17:47,041 --> 00:17:49,458
[UMIHEBI growls]
They had better be.

365
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:51,541
Throw these brats
back in their room.

366
00:17:51,625 --> 00:17:53,833
When I'm done with this,
we set sail.

367
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,625
[PIRATES]
Yes, ma'am!

368
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:59,458
[PIRATE C] I was looking
forward to more time ashore.

369
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,125
[PIRATE D] You can get just
as drunk at sea as on land.

370
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,916
[PIRATE C]
Yeah, that's true. Ha, ha!

371
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,250
Uh?

372
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:10,458
Try to relax. You need to
rest as much as you can.

373
00:18:10,541 --> 00:18:12,291
Don't you want the truth?

374
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,666
About what's going on.

375
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,125
Who I actually am.

376
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:19,500
And why I was trying to find
you in the first place.

377
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:21,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
It doesn't matter.

378
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:23,208
You hurt my friend Obi
at the castle that night,

379
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:27,041
so it's not like I can trust
everything you'd tell me anyway.

380
00:18:27,125 --> 00:18:29,833
However, just now, up on deck,

381
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,791
you endured a lot of pain,

382
00:18:31,875 --> 00:18:34,458
and kept your mouth
shut for your friends.

383
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,083
I can at least
trust that action.

384
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:38,291
Uh?

385
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,375
Besides, we can talk about
it when this is over.

386
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:44,833
As soon as we get out
of here and we're safe.

387
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:50,458
Let's do that.

388
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:52,458
[BOTH gasp]

389
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,208
[PIRATE C]
Set sail!

390
00:18:56,291 --> 00:18:58,291
Damn it! They've pulled
up the anchor.

391
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:01,250
We've started moving again!

[PIRATE D] You stay in here
and keep quiet, or else!

00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:18,458
[KAZUKI]
Uh?

397
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,208
What kind of girl gets
sold 'cause the jail

398
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,666
doesn't know what to do with
her, for cryin' out loud?

399
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:24,375
[KAZUKI]
Hey, wait!

400
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:28,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Um, Miss, are you all right?

401
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:35,083
[gasps] Kiki!

402
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:36,958
[MITSUHIDE] You want to
pretend to be a criminal

403
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,708
and get sold to the Claw?

404
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:41,208
They're less likely to be
suspicious of a woman.

405
00:19:41,291 --> 00:19:44,041
At the very least, if Shirayuki
is on the ship like we think,

406
00:19:44,125 --> 00:19:45,416
then she'll have a
friend to protect her.

407
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,375
Bad idea, don't let her!
That'd be way too dangerous!

408
00:19:48,458 --> 00:19:50,291
We have to save her somehow.

409
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:54,000
I'm willing to take this risk
if it gets us any closer.

Your Highness,

411
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,875
I have some information
that you might want.

412
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:58,958
What is it?

413
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,625
Their base would
be weak right now

414
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,666
with the boss and
her crew at sea.

415

[ZEN]
What do you mean?

416
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,000
[MIHAYA] You remember that
my father was a count,

417
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,625
and that he circulated
with all kinds of people?

418
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,000
[ZEN]
I do.

00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:13,875
The pirates, a female leader,
the back room deals.

420

Memories are flooding back
of my crooked father

00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:17,583
and ruined older brother.

422
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,083
I think they were in
business with the Claw.

423
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,458
[BOTH gasp]

424
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:23,750
[MIHAYA] In fact, my family
was in so deep with them

425
00:20:23,833 --> 00:20:25,000
that we were
once invited back

426
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,833
to the main base
of their operation.

00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,791
Are you saying you
remember how to find it?

429
00:20:30,875 --> 00:20:32,125
[MUKAZE]
Impressive.

430
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,666
We've been searching for years,

431
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:37,833
but I don't think we've come
close to locating their mansion.

432
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,916
Now, I probably wouldn't
be offering to help

433
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,000
if the situation
wasn't so desperate,

434
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:44,166
but this information
will cost you.

435
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,041
[ZEN growls]
Why am I surprised?

436
00:20:46,125 --> 00:20:47,125
Of course you'd say that.

437
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,750
Mihaya, will you
please tell us wh--

438
00:20:49,833 --> 00:20:53,000
This actually doesn't concern
Prince Zen or Clarines.

439
00:20:53,083 --> 00:20:56,875
The Claw of the Sea's base
is in Tanbarun territory.

440
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,250
That means it concerns
you, Prince Raj.

441
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:01,166
This is technically
your problem.

442
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:02,583
Are you willing to
give me what I want

443
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,333
in exchange for the information?

444
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:05,083
Very well.

445
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,250
[MIHAYA]
Seriously?!

446
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,000
You're certainly not
the first scoundrel

447
00:21:08,083 --> 00:21:10,250
to sell information to Tanbarun.

448
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,625
And I want to save Shirayuki.

449
00:21:12,708 --> 00:21:14,541
If, in the process,
you can help us root out

450
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,583
a festering scourge on our
kingdom, I'd be grateful.

451
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:20,166
Such a gift warrants
a handsome reward.

452
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,958
Right, Sakaki?

453
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,541
[SAKAKI]
Indeed.

454
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,833
Keep it safe.

455
00:21:32,083 --> 00:21:33,750
I will.

00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:36,833
[KIKI]
Your Highness.

457
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,708
Let's go over the plan.

458
00:21:51,791 --> 00:21:52,833
It's you!

459
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:53,791
Yes, I'm here.

00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:56,083
Uh! Wait, you know each other?

00:21:56,166 --> 00:21:57,583
You must be Kazuki.

462
00:21:57,666 --> 00:22:00,250
The chief has been
worried about you.

463

00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:05,333
Shirayuki. I'm so
relieved to see you.

465
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:07,875
We tricked them into throwing
me in here like this.

There's nothing to worry
about now, all right?
