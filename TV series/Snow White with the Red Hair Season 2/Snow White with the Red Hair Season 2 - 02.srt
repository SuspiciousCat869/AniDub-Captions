00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:11,416
[SERVANT A] She's right
through this door, sir.

2
00:00:13,875 --> 00:00:15,208
Why thank you.

3
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:16,583
Uh?!

4
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:19,750
[OBI]
I, uh... Hello, Miss?

5
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,500
Obi!

6
00:00:21,583 --> 00:00:23,916
Wow, dancing instead of
herbs. That's a shock.

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,625
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, good! All right, come on.

8
00:00:25,708 --> 00:00:27,625
I really need you
to practice with me!

9
00:00:27,708 --> 00:00:28,625
You what?

10
00:00:28,708 --> 00:00:30,708
[TEACHER A]
No, no, it's fine!

11
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,666
Shirayuki is, uh...

12
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,291
she seems to finally be
getting the hang of it.

13
00:00:35,375 --> 00:00:36,833
Is that the dance teacher?

14
00:00:36,916 --> 00:00:39,750
Yes, and I keep stepping
on his poor toes.

15
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:41,125
I feel bad for him.

16
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:42,708
So you wanna step on me?

17
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:44,291
Yes, if you don't mind!

18
00:00:44,375 --> 00:00:47,125
Well, I'd love to, but
I can't at the moment.

19
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:50,666
I'm on my way to guard Mihaya,
otherwise, I, y'know, would.

20
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:52,041
Oh, right.

21
00:00:52,125 --> 00:00:54,083
I was also wanting to
go down to the port

22
00:00:54,166 --> 00:00:57,208
to see if I could find anything
else out, but that's okay.

23
00:00:57,291 --> 00:00:58,583
You and the master.

24
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,625
You're both always
so dependable.

25
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,125
But don't you have
your hands kinda full

26
00:01:02,208 --> 00:01:04,708
with all that getting ready
to go to Tanbarun stuff?

27
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:07,416
From dancing lessons for
the ball to table etiquette

28
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,291
and appropriate
court... whatever.

29
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,666
You have a lot to do, don't you?

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,208
Leave it to me and the prince.

31
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:15,541
We can handle investigating
the pretty boy.

32
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,875
Here you go.

33
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,125
The Chief Herbalist asked
me to give this to you,

34
00:01:19,208 --> 00:01:20,625
and Ryu wanted you
to have these herbs

35
00:01:20,708 --> 00:01:22,916
that will help with sore feet.

36
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,333
Thank you.

37
00:01:24,416 --> 00:01:26,291
[OBI]
Well, get to it.

38
00:01:28,333 --> 00:01:29,958
[door closes]

39
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,916
[sighs] Obi. Has he left, yet?

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
He has. He doesn't
enjoy being the guard

41
00:03:11,083 --> 00:03:12,625
for that mountain
monkey, though.

42
00:03:12,708 --> 00:03:14,750
Well, at least not every day.

43
00:03:14,833 --> 00:03:17,625
We should hopefully find
out something soon.

44
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:19,458
[ZEN]
Indeed.

45
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,833
A mysterious kid
named Kazuki, huh?

46
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,416
[SOLDIER A] A pretty boy
with his hair tied up?

47
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:29,708
[OBI]
His name is Kazuki,

48
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:32,000
and we had high hopes
for him in our troupe,

49
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,875
but he claimed all he'd ever
wanted to be was a knight.

50
00:03:34,958 --> 00:03:37,000
Then, one day, he just
up and ran away

51
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,250
with all the troupe's money.

52
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:40,208
[SOLDIER A] Brat sounds
like quite a handful.

53
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:42,541
If a kid like that
shows up, y'know,

54
00:03:42,625 --> 00:03:45,083
sayin' he wants to join the
knights or work at the castle,

55
00:03:45,166 --> 00:03:47,750
do you guys think you could
hang on to him for me?

56
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,291
[SOLDIER A]
Sure. We can keep an eye out.

57
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:56,166
[OBI] All right, might as well
go through all the boats.

58
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:57,416
When you're talking to soldiers,

59
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,000
wouldn't it be easier
just to tell them

60
00:03:59,083 --> 00:04:00,416
you work for the prince?

61
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:03,000
[OBI] Maybe, but I'm not used
to working like that.

62
00:04:03,083 --> 00:04:05,875
[MIHAYA] Hm? What do you mean
you're not used to it?

63
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:07,250
That's your job, right?

64
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:09,791
Aren't you Prince
Zen's attendant?

65
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:10,625
Who knows.

66
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:12,166
[MIHAYA]
Who knows?!

67
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,958
Why don't you focus on
keeping an eye out, yeah?

68
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,208
You are the only one who knows
what this Kazuki boy looks like.

69
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,916
It's because no one believes
you work at the castle, right?

70
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,083
The way you speak and dress
isn't exactly court appropriate.

71
00:04:24,166 --> 00:04:26,041
Not to mention I'm
with a mountain monkey

72
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,916
who wears a lady's scarf.

73
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,083
A lady's scarf? Hey, shut
up, you've got one, too!

74
00:04:31,166 --> 00:04:32,833
And a stray-cat face!

75
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,250
Just to be clear, you and I
are not equals, got it?!

I have noble blood in my veins!

You're a peasant and
can't accomplish anything,

78
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,625
but I, on the other--

can't accomplish.

If you even try to meddle
with Shirayuki or my master,

82
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:49,208
I'll tie you up
with that neck scarf

83
00:04:49,291 --> 00:04:51,708
and send you back
to the mountains.

All right.

Is that normal for him?

You trusted me to be her guard,

Fighting with swords
is one thing,

couldn't beat you unarmed.

would send someone I trust.

Allowing you to be that someone

00:09:16,875 --> 00:09:18,333
[ZEN]
No, not here.

162
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:22,083
This is your room, so it would
be considered inappropriate.

163
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:23,833
[gasping]

164
00:09:23,916 --> 00:09:26,333
I know a place not far
away where we can talk.

165
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,458
Let's go there if possible.

166
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,875
Right, that sounds fine.

167
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,000
[ZEN]
Since you're leaving tomorrow,

168
00:09:33,083 --> 00:09:34,500
I thought you'd be
busy getting ready,

169
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,000
but it looked like you
were sleeping instead.

170
00:09:37,083 --> 00:09:40,208
No, I wasn't. I was
reading a book on herbs.

171
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,500
The chief herbalist
gave it to me earlier.

172
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:46,250
I was hoping it would help
me sleep a little better.

173
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:47,750
[ZEN]
A book on herbs?

174
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,333
Yep, I'll sleep like a log.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,833
I had a match with Obi,

176
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:56,125
and decided he should
be your attendant.

177
00:09:56,208 --> 00:09:57,125
What?!

178
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,791
He'll go with you to Tanbarun.

179
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,958
His entire job is
to look after you.

180
00:10:01,041 --> 00:10:02,291
Obi?

181
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:04,916
Now, about what people
will think in Tanbarun,

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,000
as well as the guys
who are looking for you.

183
00:10:08,083 --> 00:10:10,625
The truth is, there are a lot
of things I want to tell you,

184
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,458
but for some reason,
I can't manage to do it.

185
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:17,000
I wish I could explain why.

186
00:10:17,083 --> 00:10:18,958
Don't worry about that.

187
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,958
I wish I could explain
how talking to you

188
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:23,875
makes me feel better,
but I can't.

189
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,750
Besides,

190
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,000
I was able to get through
the last lesson today

191
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:28,958
without stepping on the
dance teacher's feet

192
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:32,166
or even tripping over
the hem of my dress.

193
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,458
At the very least,

194
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,208
I think I should be ready
for Tanbarun's ball.

195
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,416
[ZEN]
Now that you mention it,

196
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,375
is that scrape on your
arm a dance injury?

197
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:43,000
Uh. Yeah, it's my war wound.

198
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,666
I skinned my knees, too.
It wasn't pretty.

199
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,416
[ZEN]
Heh. Dancing is dangerous.

200
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:56,083
Well, good night,
and sweet dreams.

201
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,333
[ZEN]
Yeah.

202
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:04,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

203
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,250
[SHIRAYUKI gasping]

204
00:11:31,083 --> 00:11:32,625
I hope you have a good night.

205
00:11:32,708 --> 00:11:33,666
I will.

206
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,666
I'll see you tomorrow.

207
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,416
[BOTH laugh]

208
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:45,000
[SHILA, KAI]
Good work.

209
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,500
[KAI]
Uh. Hey, look.

210
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:49,541
There's a carriage down there
by the Starlight Gate.

211
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:51,083
No way! It's Shirayuki!

212
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:52,833
What? Seriously?

213
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
I can't imagine with
Shirayuki's rank

214
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,458
they'd actually open the gate
for her if she's alone.

215
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:00,416
[KAI] Do you think she's
going out with the prince?

216
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:01,583
[OBI sighs]

217
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,500
Nobody cares that
I'd rather travel light.

218
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:06,500
They made me bring about a
thousand changes of clothes.

219
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:08,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Will you be
in the carriage with me?

220
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:10,791
[OBI] Nope. I'll follow
behind you on horseback.

221
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,375
Well, okay, then.

222
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,625
I didn't even know you were the
one going with me to Tanbarun

223
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:16,708
as my attendant until
late last night.

224
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:19,750
Oh, what a surprise. I'm really
looking forward to it.

225
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,416
You know, I am too.

226
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:24,291
Thanks for coming
along with me, Obi.

227
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:26,958
So, uh...

228
00:12:27,041 --> 00:12:28,583
I have a question for you.

229
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,125
Yes?

230
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,500
Did anyone mention how I ended
up becoming your attendant?

231
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:34,583
What do you mean?

232
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,583
[OBI] Hmph. If the master
didn't say, then it's a secret.

233
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:40,291
[SHIRAYUKI] No fair! You're
the one who brought it up!

234
00:12:40,375 --> 00:12:41,833
[OBI laughs]

235
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:44,625
I guess I can at least tell you
that the master was the one

236
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,291
who wanted to go back with
you to Tanbarun the most.

237
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,708
I'd like it if we could,
at the very minimun,

238
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:58,583
find Kazuki while Shirayuki
is away from the castle.

239
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,166
As do I.

240
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,041
[ZEN] Counting travel time and
the days she'll be in Tabarun,

241
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,250
she'll be gone for a month.

242
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,750
Would you like me
to arrange a way

243
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:09,541
to go meet her somewhere
along the route back?

244
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:14,041
Yes, but I expect there will
be some quarreling first.

245
00:13:14,125 --> 00:13:14,708
[KIKI]
Mm?

246
00:13:14,791 --> 00:13:15,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh?

247
00:13:18,250 --> 00:13:20,750
[HARUKA] You look as if you have
something controversial to say

248
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:23,000
about my accompanying
you on this journey.

249
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,333
No. Sir, I don't think
anything of the sort!

250
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:28,666
[OBI] Miss. Are you all
right over he-- [whimpering]

251
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:30,166
[HARUKA]
Hm? Uh! Obi?

252
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:31,666
[OBI gasps]

253
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:34,750
Lord Haruka, please forgive
me, that was terribly rude.

254
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,250
Word has it that
you've been chosen

255
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:38,208
to be Prince Zen's
messenger, now.

256
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,375
Uh... You knew about that?

257
00:13:40,458 --> 00:13:41,958
[HARUKA]
I heard from the prince

258
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:44,500
that one of his attendants would
be going to Tanbarun, as well,

259
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:46,791
but I didn't think it'd be you.

260
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,125
[OBI]
I didn't either, sir.

261
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:51,375
[ZEN] Oh, you're all here!
I came to see you off.

262
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:52,583
Greeting, Highness.

263
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,625
Might I have a moment
of your time?

264
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:57,625
[ZEN]
Of course, Lord Haruka.

265
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,666
Apparently, the duke
will go along with us

266
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,500
until we get near the border.

267
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:02,791
What?!

268
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,958
[SERVANT B] Prince Zen, the
carriage is ready for travel.

269
00:14:08,041 --> 00:14:09,666
[GUARD A]
By your leave, highness.

270
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:12,750
I entrust this journey to
your hands, Lord Haruka.

271
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:13,583
Highness.

272
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,041
Don't let us down, Obi.

273
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,375
I won't.

274
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:18,041
Excuse me, Prince Zen.

275
00:14:18,125 --> 00:14:20,750
Do you have... like
an object with you,

276
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,625
something that I can borrow
while I'm in Tanbarun?

277
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:24,875
Something to borrow?

278
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:29,000
That's right, like a pin,
or a button maybe.

279
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,708
[ZEN]
Will a pocket watch work?

280
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,250
Uh! Yes.

281
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:36,625
I will give it back
to you when I return.

282
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:38,208
[gasps]

283
00:14:38,958 --> 00:14:40,333
Thank you.

284
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,083
Uh?

285
00:14:42,166 --> 00:14:43,875
[ZEN]
Lord Brother!

286
00:14:45,541 --> 00:14:49,750
Don't worry about me.
Just watching everyone leave.

287
00:15:01,208 --> 00:15:02,791
I'll be back, Prince Zen.

288
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:03,916
Bye, Kiki.

289
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,375
Bye, Mitsuhide.

290
00:15:05,458 --> 00:15:07,916
See you in about a month.

291
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,958
[ZEN]
Lord Brother!

292
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:26,750
I didn't think you'd
bother to show up.

293
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,250
I wanted to see you depressed,

294
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,583
but you didn't look all
that miserable to me.

295
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:33,208
Although, it was
still rewarding.

296
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,000
What's that supposed to mean?

297
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,041
Zen.

298
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:37,583
What?

299
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,791
Shall I tell you one
thing I learned from her,

300
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:42,333
that pretty little redheaded
peasant of yours?

301
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,583
What are you talking about?

302
00:15:43,666 --> 00:15:45,458
Uh?

303
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,958
It's in the eyes.

304
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,666
Eyes are windows to the soul.

305
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:57,000
I hope they aren't clouded
when she returns.

306
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,875
[KIKI] She's supposed to be
in Tanbarun for seven days.

307
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,250
I hope she'll choose to
come back afterwards.

308
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:08,916
[MITSUHIDE]
As do I.

309
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,291
But if things seem off at all,

310
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,625
it's not like we have
to just wait around.

311
00:16:12,708 --> 00:16:15,875
Besides, you know Zen. He's
scary when he gets angry.

312
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,958
Very true.

313
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:24,583
[MITSUHIDE] I have this feeling
I should've talked to Obi first.

314
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:28,333
Asked him what he thought
of Zen and Shirayuki.

315
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:30,250
[OBI] I'm assuming you
can't go with her?

316
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:33,541
Allow me to take your
place by her side.

317
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:35,541
[MITSUHIDE]
Is that too boorish?

318
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,791
Even if I asked him,

319
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:39,833
it's hard to know if
he'd tell me the truth.

320
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:47,416
Clarines and Tanbarun
are allies,

321
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,541
and they have benefited
from each other's growth

322
00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:51,125
and development.

323
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:54,041
Together, they've been acquiring
land, technology, and education.

324
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,625
However, we do not interfere

325
00:16:55,708 --> 00:16:58,000
with the goings-on in
the other's castle.

326
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,375
Observe Tanbarun's court first.

327
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:02,333
Only then will you
be able to determine

328
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:03,583
the appropriate action.

329
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,583
Yes, my lord.

330
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
How can I know what I should do

331
00:17:09,041 --> 00:17:11,666
when I don't know what I can do?

332
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:17,166
[bell tolls]

333
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,125
Hey, Shirayuki,

334
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:28,000
can you grab me a bundle
of tartsugi herb, please?

335
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:34,416
[GARAK] Preparing medicine
for a new prescription?

336
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,208
Yes.

337
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:41,375
I think she should be
arriving at Tanbarun around now.

338
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,916
Right.

339
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:47,500
[SHIRAYUKI] Lord Haruka,
thank you very much.

340
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:49,625
Please be careful
on your way back.

341
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,333
Try to keep this in mind, girl.

342
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:53,708
You were invited to
attend Tanbarun's ball

343
00:17:53,791 --> 00:17:56,291
and ordered by
Prince Izana to go.

344
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,458
Don't come back in disgrace.

345
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,833
The same to you!

346
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,041
Sir!

347
00:18:04,708 --> 00:18:06,375
Cranky old man.

348
00:18:06,458 --> 00:18:09,291
So, you ready to
finish this journey?

349
00:18:09,375 --> 00:18:10,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think so!

350
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:13,541
The question is,
is Tanbarun ready?

351
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:19,791
[OBI] Good, it looks like we
haven't been followed so far.

352
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:27,333
[gasps] Miss Shirayuki.

353
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:28,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm?

354
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:31,166
[gasps] I, uh...

355
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,333
Do ya... wanna ride my horse?

356
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:35,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. To the castle...?

357
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:37,708
[OBI]
Right! Never mind.

358
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:01,083
[OBI] She must be glad to
see her homeland again.

359
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:04,166
I hope it doesn't
disappoint her.

360
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,333
[RAJ] I appreciate you
traveling all this way.

361
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:23,875
It's very nice to see
you again, Shirayuki.

362
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,416
How was your journey?

363
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,125
It was fine, Your Highness.

364
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:29,291
Thank you so much for
the gracious invitation.

365
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:31,041
I'm honored.

366
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:38,625
[RAJ]
Well, then. Right this way.

367
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:47,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Something's different.

368
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Maybe what I've heard is right,

369
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:54,750
and he really has turned
over a new leaf.

370
00:19:58,708 --> 00:20:00,166
[RAJ sighs]

371
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,958
[RAJ]
Well, now, answer me something.

372
00:20:04,041 --> 00:20:05,916
Of course.

373
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:11,958
Why on earth did you come here?

374
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:13,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

375
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,875
She came here, Prince Raj,
because you invited her.

376
00:20:16,958 --> 00:20:18,875
Yes, I know that, but
I wasn't asking you!

377
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:22,166
I came here, Prince Raj,
because you invited me to come.

378
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,416
Yeah, I know.

379
00:20:23,500 --> 00:20:26,166
I asked you to the ball
as a gesture of thanks.

380
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:28,375
After our conversation
in Clarines,

381
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,833
I felt like I was in your
debt for some reason.

382
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:31,916
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

383
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,125
[RAJ]
I can't tell you why, though.

384
00:20:33,208 --> 00:20:34,500
I'm sure you've noticed.

385
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:37,000
Prince Raj tends to be
"wishy-washy," as they say

386
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:38,875
What do you mean
I'm wishy-washy?!

387
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,291
[SAKAKI]
I suggested he invite you

388
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,916
as a way of showing his
appreciation for your advice

389
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,250
as well as his
newfound humanity.

390
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,500
[RAJ]
What?!

391
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:50,166
I was already planning
to invite her! [growls]

392
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:53,666
Oh. By the way,
who's the guy with you?

393
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,125
I don't believe we've met.

394
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, yes, I'm sorry.

395
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:59,083
He accompanied me
here from Clarines.

396
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:01,916
It's a pleasure to make your
acquaintance, Highness.

397
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,875
I'm Shirayuki's guard.
My name's Obi.

398
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,875
I've been entrusted
to secure her safety

399
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:08,083
while she's in Tanbarun.

400
00:21:08,166 --> 00:21:11,458
I was sent under Prince
Zen's direct orders.

401
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,833
[RAJ] Shirayuki, I have
another question for you.

402
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,708
Did Prince Zen have an opinion
regarding this invitation?

403
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:20,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
No, not that I know of.

404
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,208
[RAJ]
Oh! I see.

405
00:21:22,291 --> 00:21:24,208
I have an idea, Prince Raj.

406
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:26,708
Why don't you stay with
Shirayuki as much as possible

407
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:28,000
while she's here with us?

408
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,250
[RAJ]
Uh!

409
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:30,625
Sakaki, why would you
say something like that?

410
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,416
[SAKAKI] I don't understand
why you're so surprised.

411
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:34,500
You're the one who
invited her to come,

412
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,666
so you must to make
her feel welcome.

413
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:40,750
[RAJ grunts]

414
00:21:40,833 --> 00:21:42,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Hm?

415
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:44,958
Why aren't you saying
very much, Shirayuki?

416
00:21:45,041 --> 00:21:47,166
I mean, there has to be
something in this for you,

417
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,416
doesn't there?

418
00:21:48,500 --> 00:21:49,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
I do not know.

419
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:52,208
I've never spent a
long period of time

420
00:21:52,291 --> 00:21:54,041
with you before now,
Your Highness.

421
00:21:54,125 --> 00:21:56,625
I do feel this is
a great opportunity

422
00:21:56,708 --> 00:21:57,750
for everyone, though.

423
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,666
Uh? Is that so?

424
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,791
Yes, I do think it's so.

425
00:22:05,875 --> 00:22:07,666
We might as well try, right?

426
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:09,083
[RAJ gasps]

427
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:21,333
[RAJ] If you insist, Shirayuki,
I suppose it cannot be helped.

428
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:27,833
[RAJ] Allow me to welcome
you back to Tanbarun.

429
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:05,541
[RONA] So someone managed
to change our big brother.

430
00:24:05,625 --> 00:24:06,791
[IZANA]
What is it?

431
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:07,833
[RONA] What if all those
rumors are true and she

432
00:24:07,916 --> 00:24:09,666
really is special?! Shirayuki.

433
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,000
[IZANA] Oh, come now.
Why do you look so surprised?

434
00:24:12,083 --> 00:24:14,375
[RONA] Tell the truth!
Are you in love with her?!

435
00:24:14,458 --> 00:24:17,083
[RAJ]
Uh...!
