01:09:25,583 --> 01:09:28,708
There's no way we can
take on that many ships!

162
01:09:28,791 --> 01:09:32,083
Retreat! Quickly!
Slip away to the west!

163
01:09:32,166 --> 01:09:34,166
[PIRATES]
Aye-aye!

164
01:09:36,000 --> 01:09:37,625
"Friend of the Crown"?

165
01:09:37,708 --> 01:09:40,000
That's the first I've
heard of such a title.

166
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:41,875
And when was this decided?

167
01:09:41,958 --> 01:09:43,333
Just now, in fact.

168
01:09:43,416 --> 01:09:45,958
I thought it would
make them nervous.

169
01:09:46,041 --> 01:09:47,291
[SAKAKI]
Hm...

170
01:09:47,375 --> 01:09:52,833
[RAJ]
Uh! I mean. It's true, though.

171
01:09:52,916 --> 01:09:55,916
Well, congratulations,
Your Highness.

172
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:03,125
Whaddaya think you're doing
showing your face! Huh?

173
01:10:03,208 --> 01:10:05,166
I see Prince Raj.

174
01:10:10,375 --> 01:10:14,333
[UMIHEBI] Might want to head
back below deck, dearie.

175
01:10:16,375 --> 01:10:18,291
Oh, no, what happened
to your face?

176
01:10:18,375 --> 01:10:20,958
Did Umihebi do that to you?

177
01:10:21,041 --> 01:10:23,666
She did. But I'll be fine.

178
01:10:23,750 --> 01:10:25,291
[KAZUKI]
Those bastards!

180
01:10:26,875 --> 01:10:29,041
[SHIRAYUKI] It's anyone's
guess what they'll do to us.

181
01:10:29,125 --> 01:10:31,958
I can't let my guard down.

182
01:10:32,041 --> 01:10:34,833
I heard her command them to
turn and escape to the west.

183
01:10:34,916 --> 01:10:36,958
Ships were approaching
from the bow?

184
01:10:37,041 --> 01:10:38,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

185
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:45,833
[PIRATE B] The royal vessels
are coming after us!

186
01:10:45,916 --> 01:10:48,416
Quit your bellyachin',
and man up!

187
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:50,833
We're almost to the
Blue Vortex, boys...

188
01:10:50,916 --> 01:10:54,333
They can't follow us there,
no matter how hard they try.

189
01:10:54,416 --> 01:10:57,708
We just have to stay
on top of 'em, now.

190
01:10:57,791 --> 01:10:59,458
But look at this...

191
01:10:59,541 --> 01:11:01,583
Hey! What's that?!

192
01:11:03,958 --> 01:11:05,416
A bad omen.

193
01:11:05,500 --> 01:11:08,375
Uh! It's too late!

194
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:19,458
[CITIZEN A]
All hands on deck!

195
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:21,041
We're too close
to the maelstrom!

196
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,291
Will someone cut the rudder?

197
01:11:22,375 --> 01:11:26,583
Now! As in right now!
We're getting sucked in!

198
01:11:33,541 --> 01:11:34,791
It's no use, Your Highness!

199
01:11:34,875 --> 01:11:36,291
We can't move in any closer!

200
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:38,458
We can't?! Tell me why!

201
01:11:38,541 --> 01:11:40,000
It's the Blue Vortex!

202
01:11:40,083 --> 01:11:41,208
Uh!

203
01:11:41,291 --> 01:11:42,708
[SAKAKI]
A cluster of maelstroms

204
01:11:42,791 --> 01:11:45,500
that randomly appears
in Tanbarun's seas.

205
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:47,708
Unless one knows the
currents inside and out,

206
01:11:47,791 --> 01:11:49,750
it's impossible to traverse.

207
01:11:49,833 --> 01:11:51,125
If we simply plunged in,

208
01:11:51,208 --> 01:11:53,958
the ship would be
smashed to splinters!

209
01:11:54,041 --> 01:11:55,666
[whimpering]

[KAZUKI groaning]

212
01:12:03,791 --> 01:12:07,833
[UMIHEBI] I bet that landlubber
prince isn't much for swimming.

213
01:12:10,791 --> 01:12:12,458
This'll shake him.

214
01:12:26,666 --> 01:12:28,708
I think this ought
to be far enough.

215
01:12:28,791 --> 01:12:30,250
It wasn't a part of my plan,

216
01:12:30,333 --> 01:12:33,125
but at least we can
hide out for a while.

217
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:43,958
[CREW groaning]

218
01:12:46,416 --> 01:12:48,166
So, uh, are we gonna make it?!

219
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,583
Because this ship sure
is rocking a lot!

220
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:52,750
Didn't I did say we
shouldn't just plunge in?

221
01:12:52,833 --> 01:12:55,500
Oh, shut up! I know
you saw it, too!

222
01:12:55,583 --> 01:12:58,333
That stupid pirate
lady sneered at me!

223
01:12:58,416 --> 01:13:00,041
How can a person
look that arrogant

224
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:01,541
while they're retreating?

225
01:13:01,625 --> 01:13:04,041
Are you even listening, Sakaki?

226
01:13:04,125 --> 01:13:07,291
Sire, I just remembered.
The Blue Vortex will shift.

227
01:13:07,375 --> 01:13:10,083
It changes direction
every ten seconds.

228
01:13:10,166 --> 01:13:12,875
If we go with the current
instead of against it,

229
01:13:12,958 --> 01:13:14,333
then maybe...

230
01:13:14,416 --> 01:13:16,750
Every ten seconds?

231
01:13:18,916 --> 01:13:20,666
[RAJ]
Hm...

232
01:13:22,958 --> 01:13:24,916
So, any idea when we
should start counting

233
01:13:25,000 --> 01:13:26,875
for the next shift change?

234
01:13:26,958 --> 01:13:28,416
[SAKAKI]
No.

235
01:13:28,500 --> 01:13:29,625
[RAJ whimpers]

236
01:13:33,833 --> 01:13:37,375
Listen up, men! Move the
rudder left and right!

237
01:13:37,458 --> 01:13:40,083
That should get us past
this vortex to calm waters!

it's sink or swim.

They what?

got to be kidding me!

We caught up with
them, Highness.

01:17:57,916 --> 01:18:00,333
I have to go back out there.
See you later, Shirayuki!

321
01:18:00,416 --> 01:18:01,875
Wait!

322
01:18:06,875 --> 01:18:08,958
[ZEN]
I wasn't ready for this.

323
01:18:09,041 --> 01:18:14,041
I just... I didn't think we'd
be alone together so soon.

Zen... Zen!

329
01:18:51,916 --> 01:18:55,791
[ZEN] I'm sorry it took me
so long to get to you.

330
01:18:58,666 --> 01:19:01,750
[ZEN] There are guards
stationed up above.

331
01:19:03,041 --> 01:19:05,458
You will be safe there.

332
01:19:05,541 --> 01:19:07,583
What about you?

333
01:19:07,666 --> 01:19:11,083
I've got some havoc to
wreak with everyone, so,

334
01:19:11,166 --> 01:19:13,250
wait for me.

No!

[MUKAZE]
Tell me.

340
01:19:46,041 --> 01:19:48,750
How does it feel to
be thoroughly tamed,

341
01:19:48,833 --> 01:19:51,000
Claw of the Sea?

342
01:19:51,083 --> 01:19:54,708
And you tell me, what abyss
did you crawl out of?!

343
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:58,083
[ZEN] A bit overconfident,
don't you think?

344
01:19:58,958 --> 01:20:03,958
You summoned us here. We came
a long way for you, too.

345
01:20:04,041 --> 01:20:05,458
Now, then.

346
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:09,958
I am the Second Prince of
Clarines, Prince Zen Wisteria.

Do you care to take
me on, filthy pirates?

Why don't you just
surrender, Umihebi?

Listen, handsome,

354
01:20:34,458 --> 01:20:36,166
I don't know if you're some
sort of royal guard or what,

355
01:20:36,250 --> 01:20:38,708
but you sure as hell keep
getting in my damn way!

Apologies.

359
01:20:42,708 --> 01:20:45,125
I have a tendency to let
you slip off the hook

360
01:20:45,208 --> 01:20:47,583
at the very last minute.

361

Not this time,

362
01:20:48,916 --> 01:20:51,958
the day has come to haul
this catch up on shore.

No.

to worry about them.

I've got good news.

It's over.

I can't believe it.

Thank you. Thank
you all so much.

372
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:38,875
Mihaya, wait out front
for Raj's soldiers.

373
01:21:38,958 --> 01:21:41,208
He should have ordered them
to meet up with us here.

374
01:21:41,291 --> 01:21:42,541
[MIHAYA]
Right.

Obi?

Where is he?

Obi's still down there...

The Claw is in custody.

380
01:21:52,458 --> 01:21:55,125
At this point, they'll
be escorted back.

381
01:21:55,208 --> 01:21:58,916
I imagine Tanbarun will
take care of it from here.

Hey, Kazuki!

01:22:00,583 --> 01:22:02,583
Quit pushing! Stop that!

You're, uh...

More than welcome to
rest at our village

389

before heading all the
way back to the castle.

390
01:22:13,291 --> 01:22:16,583
I... I'd like to make it
up to you for everything.

Heh.

You're my father!

[OBI] I'm sorry.
My job was to guard you.

01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:11,291
I'm ashamed of
what I let happen.

397
01:24:11,375 --> 01:24:13,333
[MITSUHIDE]
Got any idea where Obi went?

398
01:24:13,416 --> 01:24:15,250
[KAZUKI]
I was wondering,

399
01:24:15,333 --> 01:24:18,458
do you think maybe you would
want to live with us here?

400
01:24:18,541 --> 01:24:20,666
[OBI]
Forgive me.
