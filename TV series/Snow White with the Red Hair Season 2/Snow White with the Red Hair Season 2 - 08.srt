Looks like we'll be able to

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,416
reach the village by sundown.

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,583
[ZEN] Raj's party will
probably reach the castle

5
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,250
around the same time.

00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Right.

7
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,750
Although, it might
take them a bit longer

8
00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:21,833
since they've got the
Claw of the Sea members.

00:00:21,916 --> 00:00:25,041
Shirayuki, how are you feeling?

10
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:25,916
Shirayuki?

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,875
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. I'm sorry?

12
00:00:27,958 --> 00:00:29,791
Do we need to stop
so you can rest?

No. I'm feeling great!

How're you?

15
00:00:32,833 --> 00:00:34,875
Used to this, so I'm good.

16
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:36,125
All right.

17
00:00:36,208 --> 00:00:38,541
I still can't believe
he's Shirayuki's father,

18
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:40,916
let alone that he's
the chief of the Lions.

[SHIRAYUKI]
I didn't know it, myself.

21

But he really is my father.

22

You were just as
surprised, then?

23

[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm. I had no idea who he was.

24

Hey, after we get over
the mountain pass ahead,

25
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:57,875
we'll be there.

Hey. Is it true you
worked with the prince?

Will you tell us more about it?

By the way. Where's the chief?

And you know, I don't
see Kazuki, either.

44
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:19,625
They're taking care
of a separate matter.

45
00:03:19,708 --> 00:03:22,458
And don't need
interruptions right now.

46
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:25,875
[MUKAZE] I guess I should
introduce myself...

47
00:03:25,958 --> 00:03:28,875
I'm the chief of
the Lions. Mukaze.

48
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,041
I'm your father, Shirayuki.

Hard to believe.

50
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:36,625
It makes me happy that
you're doing well, Father.

51
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:37,625
[MUKAZE]
Mm...

00:03:37,708 --> 00:03:40,625
Uh! Go on, say
something to her.

00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:42,333
Oh. All right.

00:03:42,416 --> 00:03:43,666
Well, I'm not dead.

55
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,833
I know that's what
you'd been told.

56
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:48,916
At the time, I honestly thought
it was the best thing for you.

57
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Oh. No, I knew
you were actually alive.

58
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,791
Grandma and Grandpa told
me that much, at least.

59
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,958
[MUKAZE] Ah. I didn't realize
you knew the truth.

How did you recognize
me, though?

61
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:01,458
I've seen you.

62
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, they told me who you were

63
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:09,083
when you showed up at the bar
a long time ago. So I peeked.

64
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:12,916
Uh? You're kidding? I was
trying to be incognito.

65

Yeah, you're not
good at that.

66
00:04:14,375 --> 00:04:15,833
Well, I should've known.

67
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,750
Your grandparents weren't
exactly the best

68
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,291
at keeping things secret.

69
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,583
Although, I'm surprised
you remembered.

70
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:24,791
That trip to the bar
was a long time ago.

71
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,625
Well, it's hard to forget.
I was just in awe.

72
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,875
That was the first time
I'd ever seen my father.

What about you?

How did you know who I was?

Oh. My hair gave it away, I bet.

No, it was more than that.

[MITSUHIDE] They said
it was in the mountains,

84

so I wondered what we
were getting in to.

I'm pretty shocked;

Hm.

You know you have to warn me
if you're about to be honest.

Otherwise, I get too anxious.

just keep my thoughts to myself.

not what I want!

of something else.

You got any idea where Obi went?

a look at the surroundings

[MITSUHIDE]
Understood.

00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,208
How awful.

104
00:05:45,291 --> 00:05:47,500
So, you were basically driven
out of your homeland?

105
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:49,625
Yes. It was hard.

106
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,458
I was a part of the
family of landowners

00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,666
to the west of here...

108

My fiancée was, well,
she was your mother.

109
00:05:56,166 --> 00:05:59,208
But anyway, she was about to
be married off to my uncle.

110
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,291
I stole her back, though,
and so they banished us.

111
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:03,791
I had no idea!

112
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:05,333
Impressive! Truly.

117
00:06:13,625 --> 00:06:15,958
Mainly because of my
uncle searching for us.

118
00:06:16,041 --> 00:06:17,500
We didn't think we
could risk stopping

119
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:19,083
in one place for too long.

120
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,375
So we just kept
running until one day,

121
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:24,291
the Lions of the Mountain
from back then took us in.

We had you not long after that.

123

In this village.
I was born here?

That's right.

And that red hair of yours, wow.

I'd never seen your
mother so happy.

128
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,458
But then... we lost her.

129
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:42,791
I thought...

130
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,666
I thought maybe this
place wasn't the best

131

to raise a little girl.

I wanted to make sure
that you were safe.

133
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:52,666
I was terrified that I
would lose you, too.

134
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,083
That's why I took you
to your grandparents

135
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,000
in order to protect
you from this life.

Um. You know...

137

When Pops was informed that you
had moved out of the country,

138
00:07:03,125 --> 00:07:05,708
he searched all over!
He looked for you!

139
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,625
He was terribly worried.

140
00:07:07,708 --> 00:07:10,250
I thought we could be the
ones to protect you again.

141
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,541
I was hoping to move you
somewhere that the prince

142
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:15,583
couldn't get to, a place
where you'd finally be safe,

143
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,000
a place where you could
be with your father.

145

Pops saved me, and I
genuinely owe him my life.

00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:23,958
I just wanted to help.

But instead you were put in
more danger because of me.

321
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:40,500
[ZEN]
I do not believe you.

322
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:41,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's true!

323
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,208
[ZEN sighs] I wish I'd could've
been there to see that.

324
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:46,791
[SHIRAYUKI, ZEN laughing]

325
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,583
I should go. I've been
here for too long.

326
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,875
I forget about time
when I'm with you.

327
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:57,041
[gasps] Zen. That watch?

328
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:58,625
The one I borrowed from you...

329
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,833
Oh. This watch?

330
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,541
It broke.

331
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,958
I'm so sorry; I should have
held on to it tighter.

332
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:10,125
No. It's not your fault.

333
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:11,875
But still...

334
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,791
I've got the watch back.

335
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:18,291
But far more importantly,
you're with me, too.

336
00:16:18,375 --> 00:16:20,791
What else could I want?

337
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:26,458
[ZEN] Shirayuki, will you tell
me more about Tanbarun later?

338
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:27,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes.

339
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,125
There's still so much I
want to share with you.

340
00:16:31,208 --> 00:16:32,791
[ZEN]
And I want to hear it.

341
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,250
We'll have all the
time in the world

342
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:37,458
once we get back to Clarines.

343
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:39,583
There's something else, though.

344
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,833
Something important I've
been meaning to say to you.

345
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:44,625
Shirayuki?

346
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:28,875
[ZEN]
So, this is everything?

347
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes.

348
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:32,166
[MUKAZE]
Shirayuki.

349
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,583
Uh. Do you mind if I act
like a father for a second?

350
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:44,958
No. Go for it.

351
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,541
I'm glad you found a home.

352
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:49,750
And glad it makes you happy and
that you chose it for yourself.

353
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,958
Oh, I'm just so proud of you!

354
00:17:52,041 --> 00:17:55,208
And I won't cry... So I'm done.

355
00:17:56,666 --> 00:17:58,250
[KAZUKI]
Bye, Shirayuki!

356
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,541
And goodbye to you, Prince Zen!

357
00:18:00,625 --> 00:18:02,958
Goodbye, everyone!

358
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,083
Shirayuki's here?!

359
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:15,000
[RAJ]
Shirayuki!

360
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,541
Hello, Prince Raj!

361
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,250
[panting]

362
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,708
[MITSUHIDE] I realize this
was the original plan,

363
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,958
but I never imagined
they'd have another ball.

364
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,958
Neither did I, honestly.

365
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:38,875
I've been surprised at Raj's
behavior at every turn, though.

366
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:41,791
Don't sound so glad
about it there, Zen.

367
00:18:41,875 --> 00:18:43,333
I get it.

368
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,666
You feel like he's stealing
Shirayuki's smile, don't you?

369
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:46,958
[ZEN gasps]

370
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,208
[KIKI] In all fairness,
she did look pretty happy.

371
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,625
True. I hate admitting that.

372
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,416
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

373
00:19:01,625 --> 00:19:04,500
I'll accompany you,
Miss, if you'd like.

374
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,833
[OBI] The master said
he would hide his rank

375
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,875
so he could attend
the ball, as well.

376
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:13,000
[SHIRAYUKI] Wow, I can't
tell if that's reassuring

377
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:15,791
or if it makes me feel
even more nervous.

378
00:19:15,875 --> 00:19:17,416
C'mon. Let's follow 'em!

379
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,041
Or we could not do that?

380
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:19,958
Eugena!

381
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:22,041
[RAJ]
What's this? You two.

382
00:19:22,125 --> 00:19:23,541
It looks like you're
up to something again;

383
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:24,916
is that what's going on here?

384
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,291
No. We, uh...

385
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,125
Please don't start with us.

386
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,916
I know you feel the exact
same way that we do!

387
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,500
You think it'd be
great if Shirayuki

388
00:19:33,583 --> 00:19:35,458
stayed at this castle
forever, too!

389
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:36,625
I do not.

390
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:37,958
[BOTH]
Uh?!

391
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:40,750
[RAJ] A Shirayuki who stayed
with me on purpose?

392
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:41,750
Heh.

393
00:19:41,833 --> 00:19:43,583
Boring!

394
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,458
[BOTH]
Uh...

395
00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:52,291
[music plays]

396
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,166
It's the song.

397
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,666
[RAJ]
Yes, it is.

398
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,083
I had them play it.

399
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,666
You should have the opportunity
to dance to the song you chose.

400
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,458
Well then, Prince Raj.

401
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,416
Would you like to have a go?

402
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,541
You might not want
to say it like that.

403
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,583
From you, it sounds
like you want to fight.

404
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,041
Does it really?

405
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:24,208
Oh, we can settle
something now.

406
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:27,541
What do you think: were we
finally able to become friends?

407
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:30,166
[gasps] I believe so.

408
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:33,625
And I'm clearly the one
who got the better deal.

409
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,833
[EUGENA]
They're so strange, aren't they?

410
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:48,416
I can't believe they think
being apart is better.

411
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,166
I agree. It's a mystery.

412
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:54,250
One of those too young
to understand things.

413
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,208
[ZEN]
That Raj...

414
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,625
Look at him, acting
like a prince.

415
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,166
Just awful.

416
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:05,083
A prince acting like a prince.

417
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,541
Shirayuki, when your hair
finally grows out?

418
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,416
Yes?

419
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,875
Come and show it to me?

420
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,291
But without cutting it.

421
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,250
[gasps] How 'bout this.

422
00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,750
You come see me in Clarines,
and I'll visit you here.

423
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:29,583
Because we're friends!

424
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:31,541
[gasps]

425
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,541
That's a great plan.

426
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Let's see each other again soon.

427
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:37,333
Thank you, Prince Raj.

428
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,166
[bell tolls]

429
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:48,041
And just like that,
they're gone.

430
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,791
Yes.

431
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:58,041
[RAJ]
Sakaki, bow with me, already.

432
00:21:58,125 --> 00:22:01,583
Now, why would I do
that; I bowed earlier.

433
00:22:01,666 --> 00:22:04,625
[RAJ] Why can't you simply
do what I tell you?!

434
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:04,583
[OBI]
I heard Miss Kiki and Shirayuki

435
00:24:04,666 --> 00:24:06,500
are in the bath next
door to us right now.

436
00:24:06,583 --> 00:24:08,958
[SHIRAYUKI] We haven't
been like this for too long,

437
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,875
way too long! [laughs]

438
00:24:11,958 --> 00:24:13,375
She's too bright!

439
00:24:13,458 --> 00:24:16,750
[OBI] When I'm with you two,
it always ends up like this.
