who should be apologizing.

166
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,833
Please, forgive me.

167
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,041
She was my guest and
my responsibility.

168
00:10:19,125 --> 00:10:20,416
[gasps]

169
00:10:20,500 --> 00:10:22,208
[SAKAKI]
Uh.

170
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:25,500
[ZEN]
So tell me.

171
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:28,416
Did Shirayuki at least spend
her days here pleasantly?

172
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,125
[RAJ]
I think so. She seemed happy.

173
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,583
Most of her time was spent
doing what interested her.

174
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,458
[ZEN]
Did she smile?

175
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:37,791
[RAJ]
Mm.

176
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,500
That's wonderful.

177
00:10:40,583 --> 00:10:41,666
[gasps]

178
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,458
[ZEN] Raj, I would like
to act immediately.

179
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,375
May I see Obi if
at all possible?

180
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:48,250
He's the one who
accompanied Shirayuki.

181
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:48,958
[door creaks]

182
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,333
[MAID A]
Excuse me!

183
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:54,000
Apologies for the interruption,
but it's important!

184
00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:57,583
[RAJ]
Obi's disappeared?!

185
00:10:57,666 --> 00:11:00,416
[MAID A] Yes, he said he
wanted to rest until morning,

186
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,166
but when I went to
check on him earlier,

187
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,208
he was nowhere to be found.

188
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:06,583
Has Obi been made aware
of what's happened?

189
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:10,375
Yes, sir. I told him
when he first woke up.

190
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,708
I know where he went.

191
00:11:16,208 --> 00:11:18,333
[OBI] There's no doubt
they entered the forest.

192
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:21,875
Probably staying away from the
main paths to avoid detection.

193
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,208
[OBI]
Hoof prints.

194
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:36,250
[SAKAKI] They even went so far
as to break into the castle.

195
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,666
We're most likely up against
a large organization,

196
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:39,958
Your Highnesses.

197
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:43,041
Do you have any idea
who it could be?

198
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:44,708
[SAKAKI]
One of the major possibilities

199
00:11:44,791 --> 00:11:47,541
is a troublesome group that
has overrun the east sea.

200
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:50,166
The Claw of the Sea, correct?

201
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:52,458
Yes, exactly, Prince Raj.

202
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:54,125
Look at how well you're doing.

203
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,500
And you only studied
national affairs a few days.

204
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,958
[RAJ grunts] Are you being
sarcastic towards me?!

205
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:02,041
[KIKI]
The Claw of the Sea?

206
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,750
Prince Zen, I've actually
heard that name before.

207
00:12:04,833 --> 00:12:06,250
You have?

208
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:09,166
They're buccaneers who illegally
collect tolls out at sea.

209
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:12,458
They use any means necessary
to avoid all inspections.

210
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,333
Money isn't their only priority.

211
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:18,541
They also trade in people
with particular abilities

212
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:21,250
or especially unique
appearances.

213
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:25,083
Those who tend to stand
out act as tools, or bait,

214
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:27,875
for the type of fishing they do.

215
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,958
Yeah, sounds terrible
and everything,

216
00:12:31,041 --> 00:12:33,541
but Kazuki told me he wasn't
tracking Shirayuki down

217
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,583
for her red hair.

218
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:37,166
Not that we can
trust what he said.

219
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,541
At least we have a direction.

220
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:41,208
That's better than
searching randomly.

221
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,791
If you want to investigate
the Claw of the Sea,

222
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:45,583
I know where you
should go first.

223
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,416
The mountains. Correct?

224
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,583
Yes.

225
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:49,791
[RAJ]
Hmph!

226
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,541
The mountains?

227
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,375
[SERVANT A]
Excuse me.

228
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:55,625
Prince Raj, the king
has requested you

229
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:57,125
take Zen Wisteria to see him.

230
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:58,500
He said at once.

231
00:12:58,583 --> 00:12:59,375
[ALL gasping]

232
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,541
To see my father?

233
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,375
Whoa. Requested by the king.

234
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:05,125
I never got to meet him
when I was a noble!

235
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:09,000
[ZEN] Here it comes. What will
the king do about Shirayuki?

236
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,791
Will he even do anything?

237
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:18,875
[SHILA groans]

238
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:21,208
You'll be fine, but your
ankle is definitely swollen.

239
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:22,625
When did this happen, again?

240
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:26,708
Oh, the last time I had night
watch, I sorta tripped.

241
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:29,500
[RYU] Chief, I've brought you
the reports on the new herbs

242
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:31,250
that we've been testing.

243
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,708
What perfect timing.

244
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:35,333
Ryu, would you make a poultice
for this brave soldier?

245
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:39,416
Sure. Since he's in pain,
I can add some alisia herb.

246
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,041
Please do.

247
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,125
[KAI]
...as it happened, stupid.

248
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:46,166
That was the day Prince Zen
left for Tanbarun, wasn't it?

249
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,250
Although, I guess it was
in the middle of the night.

250
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:50,333
You were probably half-asleep.

251
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:51,791
No, I wasn't!

252
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:54,250
D'you say Prince Zen
went to Tanbarun?

253
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:55,583
[SHILA]
Mm, yes.

254
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,250
He left in the middle of
the night with no warning.

255
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,833
But, Shirayuki's there,
so he probably just wanted

256
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,416
to be with her. I think it's
so sweet that they decided

257
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,083
to go on holiday together.

258
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,583
Yeah.

259
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,208
Did the prince happen
to say anything

260
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:10,125
about Shirayuki before he left?

261
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,791
[SHILA]
No, not in particular.

262
00:14:11,875 --> 00:14:12,958
Right?

263
00:14:13,041 --> 00:14:15,458
[KAI] Right. He was
in a hurry, though.

264
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,500
Tanbarun? I've never been there.

265
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:21,000
We should take the day
off and go sometime!

266
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,916
[SHILA] All you ever think
about is having fun.

267
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:38,333
[ITOYA] How much longer will
the sleeping medication last?

268
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:41,250
Oh, I'm guessing about
a few more hours or so.

269
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,416
That sounds good.

270
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:43,625
We don't need her waking up

271
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:46,250
and making things
more difficult for us.

272
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:47,916
Why is this empty?

273
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,625
There's a spring not too
much farther ahead.

274
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,125
I'll get water. You should
rest here with her.

275
00:14:54,208 --> 00:14:56,916
[KAZUKI]
I will, thanks.

276
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,125
[exhales] We can
finally go home.

277
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:02,875
You just have to wait
a little longer.

278
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:07,875
I'm taking you to where
you truly belong.

279
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:12,541
Pops is gonna be so happy.

280
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:15,333
Hm? Already? That
wasn't very far--

281
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:18,083
[gasps] Why are you here?

282
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,125
Prince Zen Wisteria
of Clarines.

283
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,125
This situation we're in.
It's rather shameful.

284
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:29,333
I give my consent for you
and your attendants

285
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:34,416
to move freely in my kingdom.
That being said, keep in mind.

286
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,708
You may not conduct yourself as
if you are in your own kingdom.

287
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:40,833
However, you may act
with Raj's authority.

288
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:46,083
[ZEN] He's helping me on the
condition that I be discerning.

289
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:50,333
I'll take it.
Thank you, Your Majesty.

290
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:52,750
[ZEN]
I appreciate your consideration.

291
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,791
Our goal here is to rescue
the girl, Shirayuki.

292
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,416
I don't plan on
revealing my title.

293
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,500
At least not until I have
the villains on their knees.

294
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:11,000
I bet it's going
well in there. Yeah.

295
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,458
[ZEN]
Thanks for waiting!

296
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:14,166
Zen!

297
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,333
[KIKI]
How was it?

298
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:16,791
Good.

299
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:19,083
The king gave his permission
for us to do what we need.

300
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,083
We can move freely now,
so let's start the search.

301
00:16:22,166 --> 00:16:23,250
[KIKI]
That's great.

302
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:25,583
[MITSUHIDE]
We need to investigate fast.

303
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:28,833
Mihaya. Looks like you get
to come along with us again.

304
00:16:28,916 --> 00:16:30,416
Well, what a surprise.

305
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,000
I guess it's nice to be needed,
even if I am resented.

306
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:35,375
[RAJ]
Zen.

307
00:16:37,333 --> 00:16:41,875
I, uh, I would also
like to accompany you!

308
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,750
Are you sure?

309
00:16:43,833 --> 00:16:45,833
[RAJ]
I made a promise to her.

310
00:16:45,916 --> 00:16:48,041
To Shirayuki.

311
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:49,875
We'll see. Next time.

312
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,833
When I come back to visit again,

313
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:54,166
I can't wait to hear all of the
townspeople talking about

314
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:58,375
their prince with pride in their
voices. I know that they will!

315
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,375
As prince, it is shameful
for me to simply stay here.

316
00:17:01,458 --> 00:17:04,750
I think I can do more than
just pray for her safety.

317
00:17:04,833 --> 00:17:07,208
I'll do whatever it takes.

318
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:10,708
Now, let's go bring
Shirayuki back together!

319
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,916
I welcome your help.

320
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,541
[TANBARUN KING]
How about that.

321
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:18,250
I never would have guessed my
idiot son would be out there

322
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:20,250
and not hiding away
in his room right now.

323
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:22,750
Interesting fact,
he finds it important

324
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,583
for Shirayuki and Prince Zen
to take him seriously.

325
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:29,458
Ah. When I found out
she was coming,

326
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:31,125
I assumed it was on a whim,

327
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,125
but that does not
appear to be the case.

328
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,500
And now another prince
is here for her.

329
00:17:35,583 --> 00:17:37,250
You'd almost think
this Shirayuki girl

330
00:17:37,333 --> 00:17:40,291
specialized in bettering
immature royalty.

331
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:44,458
She must be brought
back safely. Understood?

332
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,041
[SAKAKI]
Sire.

333
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,583
[ITOYA gasping]

334
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:54,791
[ITOYA]
Kazuki?!

335
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,375
Kazuki!

336
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,083
Damn it.

[ITOYA groaning]

341
00:18:16,458 --> 00:18:18,458
So, how's your neck doing?

342
00:18:18,541 --> 00:18:20,666
You get to tell me where
Shirayuki is, now.

343
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:22,125
What?

344
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:23,833
Are you saying you're not
the one who just took them?

345
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:25,333
They both are gone.

346
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:27,791
Her and Kazuki.

347
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,541
[ITOYA]
It's a claw!

348
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:35,625
Let go of me.
We have to go help them.

349
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:37,125
[OBI]
What do you mean?

350
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:38,916
I don't have time to explain!

351
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,458
If I don't tell my crew
now, it'll be too late.

352
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,458
Please!

353
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:47,083
If this is an act,
it's pretty convincing.

354
00:18:50,625 --> 00:18:56,000
[OBI] But I will not let you go.
You're taking me with you.

355
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:02,958
[gasps]

356
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
Where am I? What happened?

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
It's that boy!

Ow!

[KAZUKI groaning]

00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,666
[KAZUKI]
Why are you here, too?!

362
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,375
No. Oh. God, no.

Quickly! Cover up your face!

00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:48,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ah!

366
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,416
What the--? Umihebi?

367
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,750
Good. So you're awake.

368
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,958
What are you trying to do?!
Where the hell are we?!

369
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:58,708
[UMIHEBI]
Oh, don't be so dramatic.

370
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,250
You were hiding from us.
What were we supposed to do?

371
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:02,875
Not come get you?

372
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:04,208
Who's that?

373
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,375
I told you. I'm not a part
of your crew anymore!

374
00:20:06,458 --> 00:20:08,958
You're adorable, but
that's not up to you.

375
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:10,666
Be grateful you got
to stretch your wings

376
00:20:10,750 --> 00:20:12,000
and have sweet dreams.

377
00:20:12,083 --> 00:20:13,166
And don't worry,

378
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:16,166
we have plenty of work
for you to do now.

379
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:20,000
Yoo, hoo? Girl with hair
as red as the rose.

380
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:22,291
You understand the
situation, my pet.

381
00:20:22,375 --> 00:20:23,250
[gasps]

382
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:25,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen's watch.

383
00:20:25,375 --> 00:20:26,541
That's right!

384
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,541
It fell off at the castle!

385
00:20:30,708 --> 00:20:33,000
Let her go! She has nothing
to do with you people!

386
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,666
You have no reason to keep her!

387
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,458
We've been following
you for a while,

388
00:20:36,541 --> 00:20:39,166
so we know that we have
every reason to keep her.

389
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,125
Oh, those mountain men.

390
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:44,000
It'll be fun to find out
how much they want her.

391
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,333
You should know.

392
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:48,000
After all, you're friends
with them, aren't you?

393
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,541
If we play our cards right,

394
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:53,416
that exhausting old man might
even shut his trap for good.

395
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:55,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
What are they talking about?

396
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,625
You should tread more
carefully, pirate.

397
00:20:57,708 --> 00:21:00,250
Remember on land,
you're nothing.

398
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:01,833
Uh!

399
00:21:01,916 --> 00:21:03,416
The fairest face.

400
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:07,250
Oh, how I wish you wouldn't
make me hit it so often.

401
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:10,208
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

402
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:14,083
I'm so sorry, but you won't be
able to go back home anymore.

403
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:15,208
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

404
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:20,041
[UMIHEBI laughs]

405
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,750
[KAZUKI]
Stop! Don't touch her!

406
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:33,166
[UMIHEBI] Well, you kids should
at least try to get along.

407
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:37,541
Oh, make sure you don't touch
anything above the neck.

408
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:45,916
Please, what's going
on? I'm so confused.

409
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,875
[KAZUKI] After we took
you out of the castle,

410
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,708
you and I were attacked by one
of those evil woman's companions

411
00:21:50,791 --> 00:21:53,083
when we were by ourselves.

412
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,958
[inaudible]

413
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,375
When I came to, we were
in here together.

414
00:22:01,458 --> 00:22:03,541
So in other words,
you're saying,

415
00:22:03,625 --> 00:22:07,083
I was kidnapped
from my kidnappers?

416
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:09,041
Basically, yes.

417
00:22:09,125 --> 00:22:10,500
[gasps]

418
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,583
Listen, I'm not quite
sure where we are yet,

419
00:22:14,666 --> 00:22:16,458
but these people are the
pirates that are known

420
00:22:16,541 --> 00:22:17,791
for ruling the sea.

421
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,416
No matter what, we can't
let them get us on a ship.

422
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:24,958
If we don't get away fast,
no one will hear from us again.

423
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:26,750
[UMIHEBI]
I'm so sorry,

424
00:22:26,833 --> 00:22:30,083
but you won't be able
to go back home anymore.

425
00:22:30,166 --> 00:22:32,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

426
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,666
[MUKAZE]
And prepare the ship!

427
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,875
[ZEN]
You dragged her out by force.

428
00:24:06,958 --> 00:24:08,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're going to kill him!

429
00:24:08,375 --> 00:24:09,541
Please, stop!

430
00:24:09,625 --> 00:24:11,625
[MUKAZE] We don't abide
by the rule of kings.

431
00:24:11,708 --> 00:24:13,250
That's why our people trust us.

432
00:24:13,333 --> 00:24:15,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
I haven't heard Zen's voice

433
00:24:15,083 --> 00:24:17,000
in what seems like an eternity.
