[ZEN] With Shirayuki out of
our sight in Tanbarun,

2
00:00:17,083 --> 00:00:19,916
we were desperate to catch
Kazuki and get some answers.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,791
But fate had other plans.

4
00:00:25,541 --> 00:00:27,583
You're earlier than I expected.

5
00:00:27,666 --> 00:00:29,500
Nice to see you.

6
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:31,083
Spare me.

7
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:34,541
There's nothing nice about the
wild-goose chase you took us on.

8
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,875
Although your audacity
is impressive.

9
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,625
Did you actually believe
we wouldn't be able

10
00:00:38,708 --> 00:00:40,125
to track you down again?

11
00:00:40,208 --> 00:00:42,416
Perhaps we should have
kept you on a leash.

12
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,541
Now that you mention it,

13
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:45,416
I could have used
a leash last night.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:47,208
If I'd had one, I might
have been able to bring

15
00:00:47,291 --> 00:00:50,291
that little brat Kazuki back
here and save you some work.

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,833
Another disappointment.

17

How did he escape your clutches?

I, uh...

19
00:00:55,208 --> 00:00:56,666
I almost had him, but
then one of his friends

showed up with some
new information.

He knew where she was.

00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:02,250
He said Shirayuki
was in Tanbarun,

that she was staying
at the castle?!

Isn't that standard
practice, though?

Kidnapping a princess
guarded by a knight?

You don't understand what kind
of girl you're dealing with.

You do.

Why not come with
us and help out?

I won't help you do anything.

No, I don't think so.

all of this back

when you asked him?

He dodged the question, but
that hardly means anything.

Why don't you persuade Shirayuki

162
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:02,375
to stay in Tanbarun instead?

163
00:08:02,458 --> 00:08:04,125
I'm sure you could.

164
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,291
[RAJ gasps]
Are you trying to kill me?

165
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,750
I'm retiring to bed now.
Goodnight!

166
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,583
[RAJ]
How could he say such a thing?

167
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,416
If he knew how terrifying
that Prince is,

168
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,583
he would never ask me that.

169
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:19,875
Big brother...

170
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:23,833
Keep her here. You
can't let her go away.

171
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,708
[SAKAKI] Oh, I guess
you can't sleep there.

172
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:29,166
Should I show you to
Shirayuki's quarters, instead?

173
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:32,250
We're simply friends.
You said so yourself earlier!

174
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,333
There are a million other
beds in this castle!

175
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,375
[door slams]

176
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:40,208
Wow. He's a rather
presumptuous fool.

177
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:50,583
[OBI]
Another library day?

178
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,583
[MAID A]
Here's your tea, Your Highness.

179
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you very much, Miss.

180
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:00,166
[RAJ coughs]

181
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:01,875
[gasps]

182
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,958
[RAJ]
Shirayuki?

183
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,166
Yes?

184
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,833
[RAJ]
Uh...

185
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
What's on your mind?

186
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,208
[RAJ] Well, you see. I've given
quite a bit of serious thought

187
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,916
to what you mentioned
the other day,

188
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,250
about the possibility of
changing our relationship.

189
00:09:19,333 --> 00:09:21,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
And?

190
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,416
I'm curious.

191
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,458
How would you classify our
relationship as it stands?

192
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh! Um.

193
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,583
I'm not sure I know
how to answer that.

194
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,166
Yes, I expected
that you wouldn't.

195
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:35,000
It's all right, I don't
know if I could, either.

196
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:36,541
I understand.

197
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:39,000
But I hope that you're glad I'm
prince of Tanbarun at least.

198
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,666
I've tried my best
to earn that much.

199
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,458
Are you? Be honest.

200
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:46,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh.

201
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,166
I, uh, well...

202
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,500
I mean... Uh, ah...

203
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,708
[RAJ sighs]
Well. It's fine.

204
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:58,875
I'm well aware I have a lot
more work to do in that arena.

205
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:02,875
Well, then. I have to
find out what I lack.

206
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,500
[OBI]
Mm?

207
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
We'll see, next time.

208
00:10:10,916 --> 00:10:13,041
[RAJ gasps]

209
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,666
When I come back to visit again.

210
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,500
I can't wait to hear
all of the townspeople

211
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,916
talking about their prince
with pride in their voices.

212
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,541
I know that they will!

213
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,541
[RAJ gasps]

214
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,625
Wait. How do people
talk about me now?

215
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:26,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. Prince Raj.

216
00:10:26,833 --> 00:10:29,000
You hear that?
She's good for him.

217
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:30,125
[EUGENA]
Yes.

218
00:10:30,208 --> 00:10:32,833
We cannot let her
go back to Clarines.

219
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:35,333
We have to make him want to
keep her here forever and ever!

220
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,250
[OBI]
I don't think so.

221
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:41,458
Shirayuki's place isn't here.
You can't have her.

222
00:10:41,541 --> 00:10:43,083
What?

223
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,041
[RAJ]
Is something wrong?

224
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,333
[RONA]
Why not?!

225
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:48,708
How could she ever want
to be anywhere else?!

226
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:52,125
Is there something in
Clarines that's better?

227
00:10:52,208 --> 00:10:53,333
Well, is there?!

228
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,541
[RAJ]
You two, again? What is this?

229
00:10:55,625 --> 00:10:57,750
What do you think
you're doing in here?!

230
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:59,750
Oh! Our brother's
in the library!

231
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:02,166
Have you developed a sudden
interest in books?

232
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,916
[RAJ] Uh?! Wh-Wh-What do
you mean by "sudden"?

233
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,250
You obviously don't
understand this,

234
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,166
but I had to bring the work
I usually do at night

235
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,125
in my bedroom out
in to the public!

236
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:13,375
I am entertaining a guest,
so I had to make an exception!

237
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,541
When did you find them?

238
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,958
Just about a minute ago.

239
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,833
They're so sneaky.

240
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:19,291
I'm surprised you were able to!

241
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,541
They're no match for me.

242
00:11:21,625 --> 00:11:22,916
[RONA]
It can't be!

243
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,666
I shall be unparalleled!

244
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:26,875
And I shall write books,
that are about, books!

245
00:11:26,958 --> 00:11:28,541
But I shall write
them in secret!

246
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,166
[RONA grunts]

247
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:30,208
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

248
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,041
[OBI gasping]

249
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:42,458
Oh! I'm so clumsy!

250
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,416
I'm always tripping
over my own feet!

251
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,125
No. It's fine.

252
00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:46,958
Ah!

253
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,500
Thanks for catching me, Obi.

254
00:11:48,583 --> 00:11:52,541
You're welcome. It's my job.

255
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,166
This might prove to be more
difficult than we thought.

256
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,625
Then why don't we just
not do anything instead?

257
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:59,625
No, this is only the beginning!

258
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,833
Now, pull yourself
together, Eugena!

259
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:02,833
[BOTH]
Uh?!

260
00:12:02,916 --> 00:12:06,250
I have had enough!

261
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,291
I don't know what kind of
scheme you're cooking up,

262
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:09,500
but I won't have it!

263
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:10,750
Go back to your rooms and...

264
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,416
[RONA] We would've gone
without you dragging us!

265
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,250
[RAJ] I don't care!
You deserve this!

266
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,291
Well, they are
certainly precocious.

267
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,166
They're somethin'.

268
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:26,375
[SAKAKI]
Good morning, Your Highness.

269
00:12:28,583 --> 00:12:30,541
[SAKAKI]
Prince Raj?

270
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:39,875
Thankfully, they're
spending some time

271
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,541
in the herb garden today.

272
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,208
Oh, is that what they're doing?

273
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:49,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Wow, you have the furagi herb!

274
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,250
It usually only grows this
well in the mountains.

275
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:53,666
Is that where it's found?

276
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,416
Yep. I used to love
going on long walks

277
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,291
to collect this herb
on my days off.

278
00:12:58,375 --> 00:13:00,833
You'd do that alone?

279
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:03,250
I've heard there's a group
of vigilantes up there.

280
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,416
Apparently, they defend the
people against bandit attacks.

281
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,000
Oh, are you talking about
the soldiers from the castle?

282
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,208
I'm not.

283
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,333
Ah-hem. They aren't
officially sanctioned

284
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:13,583
by the kingdom of Tanbarun.

285
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,625
I believe they organized
of their own free will.

286
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:18,375
But they do a good deed,
so we turn a blind eye.

287
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:21,500
They must have a keen sense
of justice to take on bandits.

288
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:24,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm amazed those people exist.

289
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,958
You're more knowledgeable
than you let on, Prince Raj.

290
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:28,333
Oh. Well.

291
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,291
I know a lot more. Wanna hear?

292
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,791
Yes! I'd love to!

293
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,416
The prince has been pampered
and sheltered his entire life.

294
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,333
Because of that he was
on a destructive path.

295
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:43,000
Shirayuki has certainly suffered
as a result of his mistakes.

296
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:47,541
That said, she apparently has a
profound impact on Prince Raj.

297
00:13:47,625 --> 00:13:49,791
He's different now.

298
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,041
I always hoped he'd get
the chance to meet someone

299
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:55,000
who'd have that sort
of effect on him.

300
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:58,541
There's a mysterious charisma
about that girl.

301
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:02,625
A kind intensity.
Her manner disarms people.

302
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:04,750
So what do you say about this?

303
00:14:04,833 --> 00:14:07,458
Think you two could extend
your stay a little longer?

304
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:12,666
[laughs] I think you'd
better ask her.

305
00:14:17,958 --> 00:14:19,375
Are you feeling tired, Miss?

306
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:22,458
No, all the things I saw
today were invigorating!

307
00:14:22,541 --> 00:14:26,333
[RAJ] Hm... So, Shirayuki.
Tomorrow, at the ball,

308
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:28,791
is there any particular type of
music you'd like to dance to?

309
00:14:28,875 --> 00:14:30,500
Uh. Oh.

310
00:14:30,583 --> 00:14:32,083
Well, actually.

311
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:34,875
I was barely able to finish my
dance training before I left.

312
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:36,125
[RAJ]
Training?

313
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:39,375
Yes. If there's a slow
song with a simple beat,

314
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,250
I think I can do that.

315
00:14:41,333 --> 00:14:42,958
You didn't know how to dance?

316
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,000
No. All I could seem to

A violin?

I'm glad.

You are leaving the morning
after the ball, right?

I am.

I'll try not to embarrass
myself dancing,

I'm so excited.

00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,541
I can't wait to tell
Prince Zen all about you.

335

You'll talk about me?

[SHIRAYUKI]
No. My mind's racing.

343
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:30,541
I was wondering what Zen
and the others are doing now.

344
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,458
I was actually thinking
about the same thing.

345

When I'm all alone,

346
00:16:34,916 --> 00:16:38,125
for some reason I start
missing the Master a little.

00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,583
He hasn't been yelling
at me as much lately.

I don't quite know how
to feel about that.

349
00:16:42,916 --> 00:16:45,250
I bet Zen's missing
you, too, Obi.

You've got it all wrong.

This is the part where you
tell me how much you miss Zen,

00:16:49,458 --> 00:16:50,791
not how he misses me.

00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:54,416
That's right.

While you gaze at the stars.

But it's late, so I
understand the error.

To do that,
