1
00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,791
[LADY A] It appears
Prince Raj and Shirayuki

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,916
will be spending the
whole day together.

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,208
And I heard it's to
deepen their friendship.

4
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,791
[LADY B] Sakaki was happy
about it, to say the least.

5
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,416
According to him, Prince Raj's
change for the better

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,333
didn't happen until after he
became friends with Shirayuki.

7
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,083
[LADY A] I caught a glimpse
of her when she arrived

8
00:00:26,166 --> 00:00:29,041
at the castle earlier,
and what they say is true.

9
00:00:29,125 --> 00:00:32,500
Her hair really is
as red as an apple!

10
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,208
So, someone managed to
change our big brother.

11
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:38,000
And how nice that
it was a woman, too!

12
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:38,875
--[RONA laughs]
--[LADY A gasps]

13
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:39,833
[LADY A]
Your Highness, wait!

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,208
[RONA]
Eugena, let's go!

15
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:43,291
What?! Go where exactly, Rona?

16
00:00:43,375 --> 00:00:46,500
Haven't you been listening?
We have to investigate her!

17
00:00:46,583 --> 00:00:49,583
Then, we can see for ourselves
what that Shirayuki is like!

18
00:00:49,666 --> 00:00:52,333
Come on, don't you
wanna check this out?

19
00:00:55,916 --> 00:00:57,291
[knocking]

20
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh?

21
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,500
[OBI]
Miss!

22
00:00:59,583 --> 00:01:01,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
Come in!

23
00:01:01,458 --> 00:01:03,750
[OBI]
Interesting. Connecting rooms.

24
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,708
Well, that's convenient.

25
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:08,958
Let me know if you need
anything. I'm right there.

26
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:10,208
And I'm here!

27
00:01:10,291 --> 00:01:13,916
[laughs] Understood.
Now, just to be sure.

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,958
You're not pushing yourself.
With Prince Raj, I mean.

29
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:18,208
Not at all.

30
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:21,208
Remember, I'm the one
who made this choice.

31
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:22,875
Great. Shall we go, then?

32
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm-hm.

33
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:04,375
[SHIRAYUKI] Um, this tea
is extremely delicious.

34
00:03:04,458 --> 00:03:05,375
Don't you agree?

35
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:07,125
[RAJ]
Yes. Of course it's good.

36
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,791
This particular blend is made
from the finest of tea leaves

37
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,958
to suit my elevated palate.

38
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh. How wonderful.

39
00:03:15,916 --> 00:03:16,916
[RAJ]
Hm...

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh...

41
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,458
Don't you find the flowers
in here beautiful?

42
00:03:20,541 --> 00:03:22,708
[RAJ] No, they're a
little plain today.

43
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:27,000
This grand room needs much more
extravagant bouquets, obviously.

44
00:03:27,083 --> 00:03:29,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes, of course, yes.

45
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,916
[RAJ]
Mm...

46
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
So, I um, uh, Prince Raj?

47
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:36,541
[RAJ]
Yes, what is it?

48
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:37,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
I think I'm going

49
00:03:37,833 --> 00:03:40,000
to head outside for
a bit to get some air.

50
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,791
[RAJ]
That's fine with me.

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,166
[door closes]

52
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,083
[RAJ sighs]

53
00:03:59,166 --> 00:04:02,000
How do you think it's
going? Good or no?

54
00:04:02,083 --> 00:04:04,458
I don't know why
you're asking me.

55
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,375
Yes, I do think it's so.

56
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:08,958
We might as well try, right?

57
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,541
I'm confounded by this.

58
00:04:10,625 --> 00:04:14,166
What can that girl gain
by spending time with me?

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:15,708
What is she thinking?

60
00:04:15,791 --> 00:04:17,291
If you asked me,

61
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:20,291
I'd say Shirayuki is trying to
meet you halfway, Your Highness.

62
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:23,416
In addition, perhaps you should
just focus on having fun.

63
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,500
I would if I knew
what to talk about!

64
00:04:25,583 --> 00:04:27,375
What more can you
expect me to do?!

65
00:04:27,458 --> 00:04:29,666
Just to figure it out for
yourself, Your Highness.

66
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,375
Ah...

67
00:04:34,166 --> 00:04:37,041
It's a tough battle
in there, isn't it?

68
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:39,541
Very much so.

69
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
This view takes me back.

70
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:46,000
[OBI] I'd like to go
down there to the town.

71
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:47,875
Check out the bars and such.

72
00:04:47,958 --> 00:04:51,083
[SHIRAYUKI] My home used to
be a bar. Did you know that?

73
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,541
[OBI]
Uh. For real?

74
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,875
[SHIRAYUKI] Yep, for real.
My late grandparents ran it.

75
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,958
I just thought they must have
been pharmacists or something.

76
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,458
I started raising medicinal
herbs while I lived there.

77
00:05:01,541 --> 00:05:03,041
Speaking of your childhood.

78
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
Didn't you tell me you were
born in the mountains?

79
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:07,291
Yes. I lived there as a baby,

80
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,958
so I don't really remember
too much about it.

81
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,708
My grandparents took me
in fairly early on.

82
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,541
Oh, I didn't realize that.

83
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,541
I would like to see the
people who looked after me,

84
00:05:17,625 --> 00:05:20,583
but I think I need to focus
on what I can accomplish here.

85
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:22,958
True. And great attitude.

86
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,291
This may seem a nuisance now,

87
00:05:25,375 --> 00:05:28,250
but you never know if it will
lead to something good.

88
00:05:28,333 --> 00:05:30,916
I actually learned
that from Zen.

89
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,625
Well, the next time
you come to this kingdom,

90
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:35,083
I'm pretty sure
you'll be able to go

91
00:05:35,166 --> 00:05:36,458
wherever you want to go.

92
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,000
Yeah!

93
00:05:41,125 --> 00:05:43,375
[RAJ]
Eh, Shirayuki.

94
00:05:43,458 --> 00:05:45,541
[clear throat]

95
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,583
Since you traveled all this way,

96
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,500
I thought I could show
you around the castle

97
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,375
instead of just one room.

98
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,500
You'll escort me?

99
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:56,458
All right, thank you!

100
00:05:56,541 --> 00:05:58,041
[KIKI] We've increased
the number of soldiers

101
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,875
and are continuing
the investigation.

102
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:02,500
However, we still haven't
received any helpful information

103
00:06:02,583 --> 00:06:04,041
regarding Kazuki.

104
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,375
[ZEN]
I wish we could at least

105
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:08,166
figure out why this kid
is after Shirayuki.

106
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,041
What's the news with Mihaya?

107
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,750
He's in town at the moment.

108
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:15,291
I sent him to help the
soldiers investigate.

109
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,875
Meanwhile in Tanbarun,

110
00:06:16,958 --> 00:06:19,583
Shirayuki's doing what
she can to help us out.

111
00:06:19,666 --> 00:06:22,875
So let's do what we can
here to help her out.

112
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,958
[BOTH]
Mm.

[RAJ]
Inside Schenazade Castle,

114
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,250
we have many walls
decorated with amber,

115
00:06:29,333 --> 00:06:31,208
many halls decorated
with wind chimes,

116
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:32,416
and a greenhouse featuring

117
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,625
some of the rarest
plants in the world.

118

What would you like to see?

119
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,166
I think the greenhouse
sounds nice.

120
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:39,875
The greenhouse?

121
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:40,916
Very well.

122
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,125
[OBI]
Excuse me.

123
00:06:42,208 --> 00:06:43,750
Going there should be fine,

124
00:06:43,833 --> 00:06:46,458
but you may wanna know you're
being watched from the shadows.

125
00:06:46,541 --> 00:06:47,041
I'm what?!

Now that you mention it,

129
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:54,625
there do seem to be more
soldiers than usual.

Uh? Yes, of course.

00:07:09,416 --> 00:07:10,833
[SHIRAYUKI]
What is this?

136
00:07:10,916 --> 00:07:13,958
[RAJ] The entrance to the
underground passages.

137
00:07:16,958 --> 00:07:18,458
They're not used a lot,

138
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:21,416
but we can get to the greenhouse
without being watched this way.

139
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,625
I bet it's easy to
get lost in here.

[RAJ] They were made to be used
in case of an emergency.

141
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:27,833
It can certainly be
difficult for someone

142
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,583
who isn't familiar
with the passages.

be safe for us, Prince Raj?

How rude!

I've been here enough times to
know exactly where we're going!

I apologize. No offense
was intended.

[SHIRAYUKI]
Is that the way?

149
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:53,000
No, it's still farther up ahead.

Mm...

00:08:05,375 --> 00:08:08,750
So, uh, how much longer do
you think this will take?

00:08:08,833 --> 00:08:11,541
We'll be there soon!
Just be quiet and follow me!

walk down this path earlier?

We're not! I know where we are!

Right this way!

Why is this a dead end, now?!

160
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,625
Yes, why, indeed.

161
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,375
You know, we're kind of
wondering the same thing.

162
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Well, maybe it's not a dead end

163
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:35,291
and there's a way
to open the gate.

164
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,541
[RAJ]
Oh! Look up there!

165
00:08:37,625 --> 00:08:39,583
If we pull those chains
at the same time,

166
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,875
we should be able to raise it.

167
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,375
[OBI]
If you say so.

168
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,250
I guess I'll take
the one on this side.

169
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,500
Ready when you are.

170
00:08:46,583 --> 00:08:47,833
[OBI]
I'm ready.

171
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:48,750
[RAJ]
Three.

172
00:08:48,833 --> 00:08:49,791
Two.

173
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,583
One!

174
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:52,833
[OBI gasps]

175
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:53,708
The wall!

176
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:54,583
[RAJ]
Huh?

177
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,875
[OBI]
Look out!

178
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,916
[SHIRAYUKI]
What? It's an arrow.

179
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,666
Your Highness, are you hurt?

180
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,333
No, I don't think so.

181
00:09:05,416 --> 00:09:07,958
[gasps] I just remembered!

182
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,833
There are traps all
over the place down here

183
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,083
in case we have
invaders or pursuers.

184
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:14,625
[SHIRAYUKI] Then, I think it
would be best to turn back.

185
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:17,458
[RAJ]
Oh, great. How inconvenient.

186
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:18,708
Huh?!

187
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:22,375
[gasping]

188
00:09:22,458 --> 00:09:24,166
[RAJ whimpers]

189
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:27,125
[OBI] So, looks like we'll
just keep moving forward.

190
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:28,666
What in the world
is going on here?!

191
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,083
Again, we're kind of
wondering the same thing.

192
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,416
Well, this is hardly my fault.

193
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,083
I'm not the one who put
the traps everywhere.

194
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,958
[SHIRAYUKI] No one's
blaming you, Prince Raj.

195
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,625
Why don't we stay put and
wait for help? All right?

196
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:42,250
[OBI]
Hm...

197
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:44,333
[RAJ]
I should probably mention that

198
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,125
no one comes down here.

199
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,500
Not unless there's
some emergency

200
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:49,833
or during patrol in the morning.

201
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:53,083
We're on our own until tomorrow.

202
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,041
[OBI]
We've walked a long way today.

203
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:03,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
True.

204
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:06,208
I hate it here. [groaning]

205
00:10:06,291 --> 00:10:08,291
[SHIRAYUKI] Oh, are you
all right, Your Highness?

206
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:11,875
[RAJ] Without a carriage, I
cannot continue any farther!

207
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,500
Go on, don't worry about me!

208
00:10:13,583 --> 00:10:14,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
We can't.

209
00:10:14,833 --> 00:10:16,916
We'll be completely lost
without you, Prince Raj.

210
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,291
[OBI] Our lives are also at
stake in case you forgot.

211
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,291
I just can't believe
this happened.

212
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:24,791
You know, it's starting to feel
like being together is bad luck.

213
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:27,375
I'm sure you agree, Shirayuki.

214
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:31,541
No, our relationship
is a different issue.

215
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:35,083
Prince Raj, let's go!
We can rely on your memory!

216
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:36,541
[gasps]

217
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,625
You... can rely?

218
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,583
Let's get out of here!

219
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:44,916
You don't have to tell me that!

220
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:00,708
[EUGENA]
I think we should go back.

221
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:03,375
[RONA] No, this is our chance
to see how things are going.

222
00:11:03,458 --> 00:11:06,166
Besides, did you see how she
motivated our brother just now?

223
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:08,208
That was amazing.

224
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:11,208
What if all those rumors are
true, and she really is special?

225
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,208
Shirayuki.

226
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,708
Where's Zen?

227
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,041
Outside.

228
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:22,416
He had an appointment with
the bird handler squad.

229
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:26,041
He knows Shirayuki is working
hard, so he's working hard, too.

230
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,000
I see.

231
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:29,083
I came to get his signature,

232
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,916
but I might as well
see how it's going.

233
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:40,208
[ZEN]
Excellent, as usual.

234
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:42,791
It's been a while since I heard
the sound of that whistle.

235
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:44,333
Hello, Kihal.

236
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:46,791
[KIHAL] Hello. It's good to
see you again, Your Highness.

237
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:49,916
Um. Do you know if Shirayuki's
working, right now?

238
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,208
Yes, She's actually away
from the castle on business.

239
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:55,041
Uh? That's a surprise.

240
00:11:55,125 --> 00:11:57,416
You had a souvenir
for her. Didn't you?

241
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,416
[ZEN]
Souvenir?

242
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,416
Yes. To thank her
for helping me.

243
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,958
I made her a bell accessory out
of walnut stone from the island.

244
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:07,041
Walnut stone, huh? I can
give it to her for you.

245
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:10,250
Please! Thank you,
Prince Zen.

246
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:11,958
I'm sure she'll love it.

247
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,791
Regarding the bird
handler squad. Tell me,

248
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,875
would it be better to have
soldiers go to the island,

249
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,833
after all, to simplify things?

250
00:12:18,916 --> 00:12:21,166
[KIHAL] Yes. I think
it'd be easier to start

251
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:25,375
with the same type of training
that we do on the island.

252
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,041
[gasps]

253
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,291
[ZEN] Very well. I will
make the arrangements.

254
00:12:30,375 --> 00:12:31,916
[KIHAL]
And we will do everything we can

255
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,333
to prepare to receive them.

256
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:36,333
Thank you. I don't
doubt you will.

257
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,416
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Izana.

258
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,500
I'm just seeing how
things are going.

259
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:43,375
Looks like he's doing
his job well.

260
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:45,416
He is.

261
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:48,500
What is it?

262
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,708
I wanted to ask you
something, Your Highness.

263
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,166
Are you testing them?

264
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:55,250
Is this all just a test for
Prince Zen and Shirayuki?

265
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,833
[IZANA]
Hm.

266
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:57,541
It is.

267
00:12:57,625 --> 00:12:58,833
[MITSUHIDE]
Mm!

268
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,333
Oh, come on, now, why do
you look so surprised?

269
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,958
[MITSUHIDE] I... didn't
expect you to answer me.

270
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,291
Why?

271
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:07,333
It's not something I have
need to hide from you.

272
00:13:07,416 --> 00:13:08,916
If those kids give this up,

273
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:13,291
I suppose I will just file it
away as a rather boring story.

274
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,083
Prince Zen has become stronger.

275
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:17,500
That's Shirayuki's influence.

276
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:21,208
And I believe he's made
her stronger as well.

277
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,750
I do wonder what the
future holds for them.

278
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:26,666
For now, it will be interesting
to watch their next move.

279
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,416
[MITSUHIDE gasps]

280
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,750
Mitsuhide, come over here.

281
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:34,166
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, Your Highness.

282
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:38,791
[MITSUHIDE gasping]

283
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,666
Whoops, looks like they
found out about our rendezvous.

284
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:43,875
Prince Izana!

285
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,416
[IZANA]
Go to your master, Mitsuhide.

286
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,958
[MITSUHIDE sighs]

287
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,500
[MITSUHIDE] That side of
him is exactly like Zen.

288
00:13:54,875 --> 00:13:56,416
Are you all right?

289
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,000
He's heavy.

290
00:13:58,083 --> 00:13:59,875
Surely, there's something around
here that will make the water

291
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,541
recede or create some
sort of path for us.

292
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,166
[SHIRAYUKI]
No. It's probably best

293
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:06,250
if we get through without
touching anything.

294
00:14:06,333 --> 00:14:07,916
[RAJ groans]

295
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,333
[SHIRAYUKI grunts]

296
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:12,875
[RAJ]
Good work there, Obi.

297
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,625
[OBI]
Yeah, thanks.

298
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:23,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
Obi?

299
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,125
Sorry, Miss,

300
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,875
do you think you could
wait here for just a minute?

301
00:14:27,958 --> 00:14:29,583
Wait, it's too dangerous!

302
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:32,458
Nah, I'll be right back.

303
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:34,625
What do you think he's
going back that way for?

304
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,791
Hope he'll be all right.

305
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:44,666
Uh?

306
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,333
[OBI]
There's a path now.

307
00:14:52,583 --> 00:14:56,291
I must've scared them
away from crossing it.

308
00:15:00,458 --> 00:15:01,625
[OBI grunts]

309
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,416
I think maybe that
was excessive.

310
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,041
Not even close, he's fine!

311
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:11,000
But, might as well
see for ourselves!

312
00:15:11,083 --> 00:15:12,541
[EUGENA]
Uh! Rona, wait!

313
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:16,291
[RONA] He probably can't move
and is trying to keep quiet.

314
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:20,416
[OBI] What a surprise.
I didn't expect children.

315
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,166
[RAJ]

[SHIRAYUKI]
I'll go take a look. Stay here.

[RAJ] Hold on! Can't you
just leave it to Obi?

What if something happened
to him, and he needs my help?

[RAJ]
And what if that happens to you?

This is about more
than just you!

would say if you got hurt?!

Yes? What is it?

[SHIRAYUKI] If you believe
my words and actions

are some sort of threat,

then I will return to

Your Highness,

329
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:58,750
it wouldn't benefit either
one of us if I were to stay.

All right, not what I meant,

00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,958
but now I wonder why you came.

332
00:16:03,041 --> 00:16:05,416
Was this all just
for appearances?

333

Get here, say you couldn't bear
it, and go back home to Zen?

Are you stupid?!

I'm here because I wanted to
try and be friends with you!

...whenever I meet people,

00:16:19,083 --> 00:16:22,791
I try to form a connection with
them in whatever way I can.

And I always learn so much,
whether here or in Clarines.

I don't want to allow our

go outside, Rona!

As a prince, if there

All right, but after you
saw Shirayuki in Clarines,

charisma about that girl.

473
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,291

Why don't you persuade Shirayuki

00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:10,458
to stay in Tanbarun isntead?

476
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,500
[OBI]
