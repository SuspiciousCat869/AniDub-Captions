1
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:10,666
[ZEN] There's a messenger
coming from Tanbarun?

2
00:00:10,750 --> 00:00:13,250
[IZANA] Arriving tomorrow.
From what I understand,

3
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:17,666
it's about what transpired
after Shirayuki's invitation.

4
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,083
Did she manage to make friends

5
00:00:19,166 --> 00:00:21,541
with that foolish
prince of theirs?

6
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:23,291
[ZEN]
Well, I'd say either way,

7
00:00:23,375 --> 00:00:26,166
Shirayuki does not think
of Raj as foolish.

8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,166
[IZANA]
That's good to hear.

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:31,083
The girl gets along well
with princes, doesn't she?

10
00:00:31,166 --> 00:00:32,500
[ZEN]
If that's how you feel,

11
00:00:32,583 --> 00:00:35,708
why not build a better
relationship with her yourself?

12
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:38,041
[IZANA] No. If I became
friends with her,

13
00:00:38,125 --> 00:00:40,791
you would just end
up being jealous.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:43,041
Your concern is needless.

15
00:00:43,125 --> 00:00:46,541
So you say, but I'll
hold back just in case.

16
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:47,708
Moving on.

17
00:00:47,791 --> 00:00:49,791
If Tanbarun still has
need of Shirayuki,

18
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:52,291
I can't wait to find out why.

19
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,708
[ZEN] I shall go out to meet
the messenger, if you like.

20
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:56,458
[IZANA]
Sure.

21
00:01:00,083 --> 00:01:02,166
[exhales]

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:38,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
That's the last of those.

23
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,375
[SHIRAYUKI]
All that's left

24
00:02:42,458 --> 00:02:44,458
is pulling out these
weeds here in the front.

25
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:47,625
Oh, I still have to see how
the akime herbs are sprouting!

26
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:49,708
[footsteps]

27
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,625
[MAN yelps]

28
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:54,291
[MAN]
Obi! Get off of me!

29
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:56,875
Well, well, so I guess
it was you after all.

30
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,541
Hey, what do you
mean "after all"?!

31
00:02:58,625 --> 00:02:59,583
Mihaya?

32
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,625
[MIHAYA]
Yes, that's right.

33
00:03:01,708 --> 00:03:03,500
Just perfect. [exhales]

34
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,416
I'm here as an official
messenger from Tanbarun.

35
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,875
You should know that I went
out of my way to come see you

36
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:11,083
right after greeting
Prince Zen and the others.

37
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,458
If that's the case, then why
were you sneaking around

38
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,125
and hiding in the
shadows like a rat?

39
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,708
Because someone I
didn't want to see

40
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:19,541
was probably with her,
stray cat face!

41
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,583
Official messenger?

42
00:03:21,666 --> 00:03:24,708
I didn't realize you
were in Tanbarun now.

43
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,458
That all happened when
you were kidnapped

44
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:27,875
by the Claw of the Sea.

45
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,125
Don't you remember I gave
them very important intel

46
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:31,916
so Tanbarun could
take them down?

47
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,458
Thanks to me, the thugs
associated with the Claw

48
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:35,791
were dragged out one by one,

49
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,250
and as a reward...

50
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,375
I was given a noble rank!

51
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:40,625
[BOTH]
Huh?

52
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,416
[MIHAYA] It's not like
I have any power, but...

53
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,208
I don't care, 'cause

54
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,041
I'm the head of the
Sisk viscount family.

55
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:50,708
Wow. Seems like you've
been pretty active there.

56
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:53,416
Is that why you're here
as Tanbarun's messenger?

57
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:54,833
[MIHAYA]
No, I lied a bit.

58
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:57,208
I was just allowed to come
along since I know you.

59
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,541
The real official messenger
is someone else.

60
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:02,083
He has business
with you, Miss Red.

61
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]
Why with me?

62
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:07,083
[footsteps]

63
00:04:07,166 --> 00:04:09,375
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki.

64
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:10,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
I'm so sorry I'm late!

65
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:14,375
Zen is inside. Prince Izana
is with him, as well.

66
00:04:14,458 --> 00:04:16,291
That makes sense.

67
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,458
What's with the
messenger from Tanbarun?

68
00:04:18,541 --> 00:04:20,583
Did something happen
to Prince Raj?

69
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:23,125
I don't think that's
the case, personally.

70
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:26,583
Well, I can't say I disagree.

71
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:30,875
Your Highnesses!
Miss Shirayuki has arrived.

72
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:34,958
Please, excuse me.

73
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:37,375
[SAKAKI]
Shirayuki, long time no see.

74
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,916
[gasps] Sakaki?!

75
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,916
[IZANA] Apparently, he
has something important

76
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,166
he wants to give you.

77
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:46,541
Prince Izana.

78
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:49,250
[IZANA] Zen and I thought it
would be best to have witnesses,

79
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,291
so we insisted upon
being present.

80
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,583
I come as a representative
of the prince of Tanbarun.

81
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,250
Shirayuki...

82
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,083
This is for you.

83
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:06,875
Prince Raj's message
is as follows:

84
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:10,583
"Tanbarun presents the title
'Friend of the Crown'

85
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,333
to Shirayuki of Clarines."

86
00:05:12,416 --> 00:05:13,083
[gasps]

87
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,500
[BOTH gasp]

88
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,333
The title?

89
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,541
The redheaded girl
you've taken is special!

90
00:05:20,625 --> 00:05:23,208
In Tanbarun, she is
held in high regard.

91
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,791
The only person to hold the
title "Friend of the Crown"!

92
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:29,416
Uh. No. That was a bluff.

93
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,875
I thought the title thing
was just part of the plan.

94
00:05:31,958 --> 00:05:35,625
Yes, and based on that,
Prince Raj proposed it.

95
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:39,166
The king approved without much
hesitation, so here we are.

96
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:40,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
What?

97
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:43,416
With this, you'll now
be a state guest.

98
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,750
Prince Raj's goal was to
ensure you were allowed

99
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:48,041
to come to our kingdom
whenever you wished.

100
00:05:48,125 --> 00:05:50,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. Uh...

101
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:58,916
Yes. Thank you very much.

102
00:06:02,958 --> 00:06:04,208
Shirayuki.

103
00:06:04,291 --> 00:06:05,250
Zen.

104
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:11,291
[IZANA laughs]

105
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:14,458
[ZEN, SHIRAYUKI]
He's laughing?!

106
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,208
Um. Are you all right?

107
00:06:16,291 --> 00:06:17,291
Prince Izana?

108
00:06:17,375 --> 00:06:19,541
[IZANA]
"Friend of the Crown", huh?

109
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:22,625
It's a bizarre title, for sure.

110
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,916
And yet... Nice.

111
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,583
Sorry, I'm not making fun.

112
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:29,125
This just caught me off guard.

113
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:30,750
[IZANA sighs]

114
00:06:34,375 --> 00:06:35,666
[IZANA]
Previously...

115
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:38,416
I told Shirayuki that
being by Zen's side

116
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:39,916
would make him
appear incompetent.

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,250
At the very least, he'd
be a negligent prince.

118
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:43,375
[gasps]

119
00:06:43,458 --> 00:06:44,750
[IZANA]
But now, with this title,

120
00:06:44,833 --> 00:06:48,666
you two can call each other
friend with no worry.

121
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,625
[IZANA]
Shirayuki,

122
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:04,416
how would you like things
to be between you and Zen?

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't believe I've ever
heard you speak of it before.

124
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,333
[gasps]

125
00:07:08,416 --> 00:07:12,458
Although, to be honest,
what could you really say?

126
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,458
Congratulations on
your title, dear.

127
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,833
[door closes]

128
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:24,083
[SHIRAYUKI]
What could I say...?

129
00:07:24,166 --> 00:07:25,125
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

130
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:25,833
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

131
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,166
Uh, oh sorry...

132
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,625
I'm all right.

133
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:31,916
I was just surprised.

134
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:34,833
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

135
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,875
You don't have to
answer him now.

136
00:07:36,958 --> 00:07:39,791
You don't even have
to think about it.

137
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,750
[RYU]
Just about done. You think so?

138
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:03,375
Yes.

139
00:08:03,458 --> 00:08:04,291
[knocking]

140
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:06,750
[GARAK]
Hello, I'm coming in.

141
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:10,916
Ah-ha! There you are.
Please, go ahead, Sir.

142
00:08:11,416 --> 00:08:12,791
Oh, Sakaki.

143
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,291
[GARAK] He said he wanted to
talk to you for a minute.

144
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,833
Well. Do you want to help
me with something, Ryu?

145
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,375
[RYU]
Right.

146
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:24,541
I apologize.
I interrupted your work.

147
00:08:24,625 --> 00:08:25,875
No, it's fine.

148
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:29,375
We actually just reached
a perfect stopping point.

149
00:08:31,833 --> 00:08:33,250
So...?

150
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:36,333
I still think of you as a
possible match for Prince Raj.

151
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:37,708
You're a good influence on him.

152
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,458
[gasps]

153
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,833
And I'd like to see
that continue.

154
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:44,291
Well, Prince Raj does not
seem to be interested,

155
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,541
but thank you nonetheless.

156
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,416
[SAKAKI]
That's a different story.

157
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,666
If I keep pushing,
the prince might break.

158
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,875
[SHIRAYUKI] It was my
understanding that Prince Raj

159
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:55,958
was motivated by
his own will, now.

160
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,458
Is he?

161
00:08:57,541 --> 00:08:58,750
Although, if I were to guess,

162
00:08:58,833 --> 00:09:01,708
he's probably sleeping
soundly right now.

[yawns]

166
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:22,250
[SHIRAYUKI] Sakaki, how long
have you been with the prince?

167
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,291
Since he was five.

168
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,041
I was only 16 when I
started serving him.

169
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:29,333
[SHIRAYUKI]
Longer than I thought.

170
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,375
Well, I've mainly just
stood behind him.

171
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,916
But, that's why I have
been in an ideal position

172
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:37,041
to see things from his view.

173
00:09:37,125 --> 00:09:39,375
The view with you
in it, by the way,

174
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,166
shone far brighter than most.

175
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,416
[gasps]

176
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,083
Not to mention how many
firsts that it involved.

177
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,000
I didn't realize.

178
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:50,666
The Prince entrusted me
with this. For you.

179
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:56,083
It's a personal letter.
To his very first friend.

180
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:04,958
[RAJ] "Shirayuki, I sincerely
hope you have been well.

181
00:10:05,041 --> 00:10:07,541
My days have been hectic
as I move forward.

182
00:10:07,625 --> 00:10:10,083
I sent Sakaki to Clarines
with your title,

183
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,083
and I am sure he has
been talking about

184
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:17,000
bringing you to me, but you
do not have to listen to him."

[RAJ]
"I feel like the current state

186
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,000
of our relationship
is perfectly fine.

187
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,458
The next comment might not
be any of my business,

188
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,875
but I shall write
it just in case.

189
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,416
About that title...

190
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,833
I realize it is not much

191
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:34,708
considering you already
have strong ties to royalty.

192
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:40,125
However, I am giving it to
you so it can be a shield.

193
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:41,916
You should hold onto
whatever you can

194
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,458
if there is nothing to
lose by having it...

195
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:46,458
I promise to do the same.

196
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:50,333
Yours, Raj Schenazade"

197
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,125

Hello, Miss!

203
00:11:28,833 --> 00:11:30,666
[gasps] Ah!

204
00:11:30,750 --> 00:11:32,958
Obi. What are you doing?

00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:36,083
Oh, you know me. Living
the nocturnal life.

206
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:38,541
I was wondering that
about you, Miss.

207
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:42,000
So what are you doing
out here before dawn?

208
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:43,500
I couldn't sleep...

209
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:45,500
I figured I'd go to
the herb garden.

210
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,541
[OBI] I've never seen
that expression before.

211
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:48,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mm!

[OBI laughs]

213
00:11:53,166 --> 00:11:56,166
[OBI] I heard you received
a title from your homeland.

214
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,750
I expected you to be happier
about it, though.

215
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:02,625
[SHIRAYUKI] I am happy;
I'm just still in shock.

216
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,541
Prince Raj seems well.

217
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:09,083
Does he? Good. I guess
that's good to hear.

218
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:10,791
So, yesterday--

219
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,708
[OBI]
Something happened?

220
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,916
Not really. Just a lot
of thinking, I guess.

221
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,541
I don't know about
where I am, now.

222
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:21,708
About where you are, now?

223
00:12:21,791 --> 00:12:23,541
I'm not sure if I get it.

224
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:25,541
Are you saying this
because you know about

225
00:12:25,625 --> 00:12:27,416
where you do want to be?

226
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,750
[SHIRAYUKI]
No. I don't know at all.

227
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,333
Well, before you start making
everything too complicated,

228
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:40,958
I'm thinking you should
go talk to the master.

229
00:12:41,041 --> 00:12:42,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're right.

230
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:45,333
Zen probably already thought it
through for me a long time ago.

231
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:46,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Really consider it.

232
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,916
And decide if the place
where Zen will take you...

233
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:52,541
...is also a place
where you wish to be.

234
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:55,041
[SHIRAYUKI]
About what lies ahead.

235
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:59,458
I can't... I don't know.

236
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,750
Going somewhere?

237
00:13:03,833 --> 00:13:07,458
Obi. Will you please
help me get to him?

238
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:10,833
[OBI] Heh. I'm pretty
sure I already told you

239
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,416
that I would take you
wherever you wanted to go.

Obi!

I'll bring him to you.

I still haven't been able
to figure out a response

to Prince Izana's
question yesterday.

I'm so sorry for not
saying anything.

256
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:10,208
It just... It made
me realize that...

257
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:13,166
since the day I told
you that I loved you,

258
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,416
I haven't really said
much else about it.

I want you to know,

every single thing I
said then is still true.

Good. I feel the same way.

Is this realistic, or
am I fooling myself?

I love you so much.

266
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:41,125
I want to be by
your side someday.

267
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,708
But can I stand
next to a prince?

Remember, you don't have
to think about this now.

Thank you.

Listen. I'm sorry.

00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,875
I should tell you
something now.

Well, hello there, Mitsuhide.

No, but I certainly would like
to know what you're doing.

I've memorized everyone's

know to sneak out!

Don't try to change me.

I got a report from the guards

Since it's still dark,
I thought I'd check on him.

[OBI] And apparently, he
was meeting with Shirayuki.

I assume you knew about this.

Of course, I knew about it, but
I didn't know what it was about.

00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,833
I'm sure he'll be back
before breakfast.

00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,041
Yes. I agree.

314

You're not going to talk to him?

[MITSUHIDE]
Sometimes, an attendant's job

Wow, the air is so fresh.

No one will bother
us in this place.

We're all alone.

Wait, I brought you here
because you couldn't stand!

324

And I didn't think you'd want

Oh! I can stand, now.

Thank you, though!

Shirayuki, you should know,

328
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:16,833
I already told my
brother that I...

329
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:18,958
That I have feelings for you.

And that's why...

332
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:26,791
No, not why, but it's about
what you said earlier.

333
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:30,333
[SHIRAYUKI] Is this realistic,
or am I fooling myself?

334
00:18:30,416 --> 00:18:33,125
I want to be by
your side someday.

335
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,583
But can I stand
next to a prince?

336
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:37,666
I love you so much.

337
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:41,041
[ZEN] The answer to your
question is simple.

00:18:41,125 --> 00:18:43,583
You can. Yes.

339
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:50,916
[ZEN]
It always has been yes.

340
00:18:54,833 --> 00:18:58,291
I realize I'm being
selfish by asking this,

341
00:18:58,375 --> 00:19:00,000
but please, wait.

342
00:19:00,083 --> 00:19:02,583
I will use the proper
words one day.

343
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,458
I promise you that.

344
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,458
[SHIRAYUKI]
All right.

345
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,250
A promise to promise
is silly, huh?

346
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,083
Doesn't make me feel too clever.

347
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:13,458
No, it's fine.

348
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:15,666
And you are clever.

349
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:18,708
You amaze me every day.

350
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,958
You amaze me, too.

Yes, what is it?

00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:53,208
I'll see the Tanbarun

They're leaving at two.

That was the first
time in his life

he did not avert
his eyes even once.

Raj appears to have become
very dependable, Sakaki.

I'm glad for him.

Thank you. He's coming along.

You're hard on poor Raj.

Yes, I know.

366
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:31,375
Until next time.

[gasps] Sakaki, wait!

00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:37,958
Yes?

369

[SHIRAYUKI] This is my reply
to the letter Price Raj sent.

370
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:44,041
Will you give it to him for me?

371
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:47,833
Of course I will. I'll also
try to win you over again.

Next time I have the chance.

[SHIRAYUKI gasping]

374

Goodbye, dear Friend
of the Tanbarun Crown.

375
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:56,083
I do hope you'll be
friends with me, as well.

376
00:20:56,166 --> 00:20:57,375
And if you need noble rank,

377
00:20:57,458 --> 00:20:59,541
I don't mind adopting
you into my family.

00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:01,125
Wha...?!

379

Next time he has
the chance. Really?

380
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,041
Oh, I'm sure he will.

381
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:08,291
Shirayuki has all sorts
of connections now.

382
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:13,875
Don't tell me,

383
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,250
he asked you to go back
to Tanbarun again?

384
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,791
Uh! Yes, you guessed correctly.

385
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,291
You know what, I don't
like the sound of that,

386
00:21:21,375 --> 00:21:22,125
at all.

[laughs]

388
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,250
Wow. I really didn't
expect you to laugh...

389
00:21:28,958 --> 00:21:31,708
All right. Shall we all
get back to work?

390
00:21:31,791 --> 00:21:34,291
--[MITSUHIDE, KIKI] Yes, Sir!
--[OBI] Why not?

need to look over before that.

[ZEN]
All right.

395
00:23:19,875 --> 00:23:21,416
So then... See you later?

00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:22,333
Of course.

397
00:23:22,416 --> 00:23:24,125
Yes.

398
00:23:25,208 --> 00:23:26,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
This is my own path.

00:23:26,791 --> 00:23:28,500
My own story...

400
00:23:28,583 --> 00:23:30,000
And I'm loving it.

401
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:32,083
Oh. So you're back with us?

402
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:33,958
I suppose you finished
seeing them off?

403
00:23:34,041 --> 00:23:36,208
[SHIRAYUKI] Yes. Are you headed
to the dispensary now?

404
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:38,125
[RYU]
Yes, I thought I'd go ahead

405
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,333
and grind the stored
montlet herb we have.

406
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:42,541
Needs to be done while
it's still good.

407
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,083
I can go with you!

408
00:23:44,166 --> 00:23:46,125
Appreciated.

409
00:23:48,416 --> 00:23:49,708
[SHIRAYUKI]
If I could,

410
00:23:49,791 --> 00:23:52,541
I would like to be able
to draw my own path

411
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,875
in whatever shape I want.

412
00:23:54,958 --> 00:23:56,416
And, then...

413
00:23:56,500 --> 00:24:00,583
I'd wish for that path to be
painted with the color of fate.

414
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,708
And that would be my story.
