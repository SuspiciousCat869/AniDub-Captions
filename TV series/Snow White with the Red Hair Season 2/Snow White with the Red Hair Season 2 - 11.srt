1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:15,750
[IZANA] If that's the case,
then you should make me an ally

2
00:00:15,833 --> 00:00:18,583
on the path you and
Shirayuki have chosen.

3
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,333
[ZEN]
I need her by my side.

4
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,375
She's the only one
I want to be with.

5
00:00:28,166 --> 00:00:30,250
When you're getting
the dust out, be gentle.

6
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,083
And it's heavy, so
take care with it.

7
00:00:32,166 --> 00:00:33,875
Right.

8
00:00:37,916 --> 00:00:39,666
[coughing]

9
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:41,166
Ah... Ah...

10
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:42,375
Ah-choo!

11
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:43,541
[gasps]

12
00:00:43,625 --> 00:00:44,666
[ZEN]
Uh?

13
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:25,208
Shirayuki. Good morning.

14
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:26,333
Hi, Mitsuhide.

15
00:02:26,416 --> 00:02:28,166
Good morning to you, too!

16
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,666
[MITSUHIDE]
Listen, Shirayuki.

17
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:32,208
Have you noticed that Zen's
been acting weird lately?

18
00:02:32,291 --> 00:02:33,458
Huh?

19
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:35,250
He just seems a bit
distracted and distant.

20
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:36,500
It's so unlike him.

21
00:02:36,583 --> 00:02:37,875
[MAID A]
Shirayuki!

22
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:38,541
[SHIRAYUKI, OBI]
Hm?

23
00:02:38,625 --> 00:02:39,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Mm?

24
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:39,958
[MAID A panting]

25
00:02:40,041 --> 00:02:41,666
Did something happen?

26
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:44,208
[MAID A] I'm terribly sorry,
but you're needed at once.

27
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:46,250
Prince Zen has been
injured quite badly.

28
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,833
[MITSUHIDE, SHIRAYUKI]
What?!

29
00:02:48,916 --> 00:02:51,083
[SHIRAYUKI] So then the
tapestry fell on top of you

30
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,500
from upstairs and
hurt your neck?

31
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:54,166
Yeah.

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,833
Is there pain when
you turn your head?

33
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,250
There is.

34
00:02:57,333 --> 00:02:59,666
[BOTH] We're... We're incredibly
sorry, Your Highness!

35
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:01,083
[ZEN]
It's all right.

36
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,166
I should have been paying
more attention, anyway.

37
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,000
Just try to be more careful.

38
00:03:05,083 --> 00:03:06,458
[MAIDS]
Yes, Your Highness.

39
00:03:06,541 --> 00:03:07,541
[ZEN]
You may return to work.

40
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:10,583
[MAIDS]
Thank you for understanding!

41
00:03:11,416 --> 00:03:13,708
I can't believe they were crying
when you were the one hurt.

42
00:03:13,791 --> 00:03:16,166
I was distracted instead
of being more alert.

43
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,916
I can't blame them for that.

44
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,916
Are you sure you're all right?

45
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,375
I mean, are you absolutely
certain this isn't serious?

46
00:03:22,458 --> 00:03:23,833
Yes, I'm fine.

47
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,416
Oh, I am so sad it hurts
to turn my head right now.

48
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,125
[MITSUHIDE] There you go
with that attitude again.

49
00:03:29,208 --> 00:03:33,333
[sighs] Shirayuki, can we talk?

50
00:03:33,416 --> 00:03:35,958
I'll go let the chief herbalist
know what happened to him.

51
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,666
In the meantime,
will you look after Zen?

52
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:39,000
Oh, sure!

53
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,458
He'll listen to you.
That I'm sure of.

54
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:43,250
His words might seem spiteful,

55
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:46,958
but I think he just wants
you to stop worrying.

56
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,000
Yes, you're right.

57
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:51,958
[knocking]

58
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:54,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Pardon me.

59
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:58,791
[MITSUHIDE]
Huh?

60
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:02,041
Excuse me. Chief,
are you in here?

61
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:10,791
[glass shatters]

62
00:04:10,875 --> 00:04:14,041
Uh? Well, that's just great.

63
00:04:15,166 --> 00:04:16,958
[MITSUHIDE] This has an
interesting fragrance.

64
00:04:17,041 --> 00:04:18,875
I wonder what it is.

65
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:20,250
[MITSUHIDE gasping]

66
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:23,500
[MITSUHIDE] I can't make
Zen wait in pain like this.

67
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:31,250
[OBI]
What's taking Mitsuhide so long?

68
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:33,250
Should I go find out
what happened?

69
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:36,541
I was enjoying the peace and
quiet, but I guess you should.

70
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,125
Oh, look, here he is!

71
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:39,541
[OBI]
Mm?

72
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:45,708
[MITSUHIDE]
Prince Zen!

73
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:48,666
I sincerely apologize
for my tardy return.

74
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:51,916
I've come back now, and
I'm here at your service.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,541
[ALL]
Hm?

76
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,916
The chief herbalist requests
you let her examine your injury.

77
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:00,666
I must accompany you to the
medical wing now, Prince Zen.

78
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:02,958
Why in the world are
you talking like that?

79
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,791
Um, Mitsuhide.
Did something happen to you?

80
00:05:05,875 --> 00:05:07,625
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki.

81
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,875
Were you concerned that
I was away so long?

82
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:13,000
You're so lovely.
I hate to make you worry.

83
00:05:13,083 --> 00:05:14,666
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ah...

84
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:16,625
Who is this guy again?

85
00:05:16,708 --> 00:05:18,291
[GARAK]
It looks as though Mitsuhide

86
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,333
accidentally inhaled
the fumes of a medicine

87
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:22,666
made from a flower with
hypnotic properties.

88
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,291
[ZEN]
He's hypnotized?

89
00:05:24,375 --> 00:05:26,291
Do you mean he thinks
he's someone else?

90
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:29,208
Not at all. Actually,
it's the opposite.

91
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,916
To put it in simple terms,

92
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:34,000
parts of his subconscious that
usually lie buried are free now.

93
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:36,583
He's just expressing them
without any inhibitions.

94
00:05:36,666 --> 00:05:39,208
All that said, he doesn't
seem to be injured.

95
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:41,166
Tell me something, Mitsuhide.

96
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:44,041
You smelled an odd fragrance
coming from the medicine.

97
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:46,166
Did you happen to entertain
any intense thoughts

98
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,541
at the moment you inhaled it?

99
00:05:47,625 --> 00:05:49,500
I did, as a matter of fact.

100
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:51,166
I was thinking about
how Prince Zen

101
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,166
has had a lot on his mind
and seemed distracted of late.

102
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:57,125
I felt guilty. I thought if
I had remained by his side,

103
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:58,333
this might not have happened.

104
00:05:58,416 --> 00:05:59,708
What does that mean--? [groans]

105
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:01,375
Prince Zen. Is there
anything I can do?

106
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:03,708
I'm fine, would you
just back off?!

107
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:05,125
[GARAK]
That makes sense.

108
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,625
I believe the potion's
hypnotic effect has manifested

109
00:06:07,708 --> 00:06:11,458
primarily by deepening
your loyalty to Prince Zen.

110
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,625
We prepared that stuff
for you, Shirayuki.

111
00:06:13,708 --> 00:06:16,416
I had intended for hypnosis to
be one of the primary subjects

112
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,958
of inquiry on your
upcoming exam.

113
00:06:18,041 --> 00:06:20,083
I'm having an exam?

114
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,208
I'm sorry about all
of the trouble.

115
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:24,916
But can you help him?
Get rid of his symptoms?

116
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,041
[GARAK]
We can make an antidote,

117
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:28,000
but it will take some
time to prepare.

118
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:30,708
[MITSUHIDE] Prince Zen,
please don't ask that of them.

119
00:06:30,791 --> 00:06:32,500
I cannot bear for my failure

120
00:06:32,583 --> 00:06:34,708
to create more work
for anyone else.

121
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,875
From what I understand,

122
00:06:35,958 --> 00:06:37,833
the symptoms will be
gone in a few days.

123
00:06:37,916 --> 00:06:39,625
It should cause me no pain.

124
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,208
[ZEN]
What?

125
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,833
[MITSUHIDE] Rather than concern
yourself with my medical issues,

126
00:06:42,916 --> 00:06:45,500
you should really focus
on your own recovery.

127
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:47,750
[ZEN grunts]
I would argue

128
00:06:47,833 --> 00:06:50,000
that you're actually the
one who needs serious help!

129
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,250
That may be.

130
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,791
However, I'm not sure
I understand my problem.

131
00:06:53,875 --> 00:06:56,291
And even if your injury
isn't serious,

132
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,166
if you avoid using your neck
like this, it could get worse.

133
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,416
You must treat it now.

134
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:02,541
If you insist on following
me like a shadow,

135
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,208
you're going to make
me injure it further.

136
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,458
I'll break it while trying
to get away from you!

137
00:07:06,541 --> 00:07:07,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Shirayuki,

138
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:09,250
will you treat Prince Zen
as soon as possible?

139
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:10,166
Uh, yes!

140
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:12,083
[ZEN]
Mitsuhide!

141
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:15,583
[exhales] I give up.
Go do whatever you want.

142
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:16,916
But, Zen.

143
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,875
[ZEN] You don't have to
treat him, either, Chief.

144
00:07:18,958 --> 00:07:20,458
If you say so, Your Highness.

145
00:07:20,541 --> 00:07:23,291
Now, Shirayuki. Please treat
the prince, as instructed.

146
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:24,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, right.

147
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,708
This way, Zen. Follow me.

148
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:29,708
I'm counting on you, Shirayuki.

149
00:07:29,791 --> 00:07:30,916
This is great.

150
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,958
[KIKI sighs]

151
00:07:35,291 --> 00:07:38,166
[ZEN] Sorry for taking you away
from your work, Shirayuki.

152
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,583
[SHIRAYUKI]
You're not. This is my work.

153
00:07:40,666 --> 00:07:41,666
Oh.

154
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,958
I'll need to put this
on your neck.

155
00:07:43,041 --> 00:07:44,916
You're going to have to
remove all your shirts.

156
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,333
Uh?! All of them?

157
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,083
[SHIRAYUKI] If it would hurt,
I can do it for you.

158
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:49,000
No, it's okay!

159
00:07:49,083 --> 00:07:50,625
I'll do it.

160
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:53,916
Right, here goes.

161
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,583
Okay.

162
00:07:58,291 --> 00:07:59,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, Zen?

163
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:01,750
Let me know if you want
something from behind you.

164
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,958
Behind me?

165
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,125
Yes.

166
00:08:04,208 --> 00:08:06,166
I know it hurts your
neck to turn around.

167
00:08:06,250 --> 00:08:07,791
So if you need anything
from back there,

168
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:09,125
you just let me know.

169
00:08:09,208 --> 00:08:11,000
[ZEN]
Thank you.

170
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:16,125
Hey, Master--

171
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:17,583
What's going on?!

172
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,875
Why are you naked?!
It's still light outside!

173
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,125
She's putting ointment on m--!

174
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:22,333
Ah!

175
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:35,375
[gasps] Found it!

176
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,000
Yoikagari, a plant with
hypnotic properties!

177
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:39,250
[OBI]
Really?

178
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:41,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yeah. An unusual plant.

179
00:08:41,375 --> 00:08:44,833
It's not a species we grow
in the castle's herb garden.

180
00:08:47,083 --> 00:08:50,041
I was wondering why you had that
stack of books on your desk.

181
00:08:50,125 --> 00:08:51,791
You were trying to find it.

182
00:08:51,875 --> 00:08:53,125
[SHIRAYUKI]
I had to!

183
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:54,833
I knew I wouldn't be
able to sleep tonight

184
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,500
unless I solved this.

185
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,458
But I still need to talk to
the chief herbalist about it.

186
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:01,208
Shirayuki.

187
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:02,458
Ryu?

188
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,708
[RYU] The chief wanted
me to give this to you.

189
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:06,291
[SHIRAYUKI]
Oh, wow.

190
00:09:06,375 --> 00:09:07,666
Yoikagari!

191
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:10,208
[RYU] That's right. She said
you needed to study it,

192
00:09:10,291 --> 00:09:13,708
since the prince wants an
antidote for his attendant.

193
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:17,833
And by the way, with that,
you've got your work cut out.

194
00:09:17,916 --> 00:09:20,041
I'm going to try and sleep.

195
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,458
Right!

196
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,875
[SOLDIER A] Miss Kiki,
good morning to you.

197
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:26,333
Good morning.

198
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,291
Excuse me, Prince Zen.

199
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:31,750
[MITSUHIDE]
Excuse me, Prince Zen!

200
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,250
Uh!

201
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:39,250
Oh, Kiki. I'm so
incredibly sorry.

202
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:43,166
Did I cause any injury to
your lovely, glorious hand?

203
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,333
Good morning.

204
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:47,125
[KIKI]
Uh.

205
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:47,666
Morning.

206
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:48,250
[yelps]

207
00:09:48,333 --> 00:09:49,791
[OBI laughing]

208
00:09:49,875 --> 00:09:51,791
[ZEN] He's not back to normal
after a good night's sleep?

209
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,791
Then I guess his condition
is more serious than mine.

210
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,041
[MITSUHIDE]
By that implication,

211
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:57,791
can I assume you mean
your tragic injury

212
00:09:57,875 --> 00:09:58,750
has finally healed?

213
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:00,500
Yeah, too bad yours hasn't.

214
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,958
Please do not concern
yourself with me.

215
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,833
These are the reports from the
areas under your jurisdiction.

216
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,458
Will you please look
over them now?

217
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:09,500
I'd like your feedback
by the end of the day.

218
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:10,875
[ZEN grunting]

219
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:14,583
He's the epitome of a young,
noble upstart to a tee.

220
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:17,625
[HARUKA]
I understand, Your Highness.

221
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,875
I will make the
arrangements at once.

222
00:10:19,958 --> 00:10:22,833
I'm counting on you.
On to the next issue--

223
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:23,916
Prince Zen.

224
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,375
It's time for your
next appointment.

225
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,541
[ZEN sighs] I'm not done
with this conversation!

226
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,458
Time is of the essence,
Your Highness.

227
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:30,958
If you're late for this meeting

228
00:10:31,041 --> 00:10:32,500
it will make you tardy
for the next one.

229
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:35,000
That will cause a chain
reaction, which will carry over.

230
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:36,791
Your lateness could bleed
into subsequent days,

231
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,083
for who knows how long?

232
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,333
This trend might continue
to get out of hand.

233
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,666
It could cause a horrible
situation for all of us,

234
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:47,041
but if you leave now,
that will all be prevented!

235
00:10:47,125 --> 00:10:48,791
[HARUKA]
Uh?!

236
00:10:48,875 --> 00:10:51,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Please wait, Prince Zen!

237
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:54,291
[ZEN]
Uh...?

238
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,083
[MITSUHIDE]
You mustn't take this path!

239
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:57,541
We will find a detour!

240
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:59,458
I cannot allow you
to dirty your feet!

241
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:01,750
[ZEN groans]

242
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,666
This is dumb.

243
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,250
It is my duty.

244
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:12,000
I am sworn to protect you, no
matter how benign the situation.

245
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,291
[MITSUHIDE gasping]

246
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:18,791
[ZEN] Sorry, Mitsuhide.
Would you hand that to me?

247
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:19,916
[MITSUHIDE]
Yes, sir.

248
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,083
[ZEN grunts]

249
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,000
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh?! Please come back here!

250
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:24,833
Prince Zen!

251
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:27,791
[ZEN sighs]
I'm free from my captor at last!

252
00:11:27,875 --> 00:11:29,416
[yelps]

253
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:34,875
I've been waiting right here
for you, your highness.

254
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,958
[ZEN]
It won't wear off!

255
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:40,500
Are you doing all
right there, Master?

256
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,958
[ZEN] I don't know, Obi.
It's just like the old days.

257
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,166
When Mitsuhide followed
me everywhere.

258
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:48,583
I felt so stifled, you know?

259
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:51,125
But now, I take our
dynamic for granted.

260
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,625
He's there, but he
gives me space.

261
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:57,000
When he gets weird like this,
it really messes with me.

262
00:11:57,083 --> 00:12:00,708
So that must be why you
two fight all the time.

263
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:04,291
Obi. Stay in here
with me for a while.

264
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:09,041
[OBI gasping]
Whatever you say, Master.

265
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,666
Well, why don't I
sing you a lullaby?

266
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,750
I've been told I have
a beautiful voice.

267
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,708
[ZEN]
Never mind, get out.

268
00:12:19,208 --> 00:12:21,541
[ZEN] Mitsuhide. Send
messengers to the areas

269
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:24,750
with issues in yesterday's
reports, two are marked urgent.

270
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,208
Who goes is up to you.

271
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,291
Right. I'll do it at
once, Your Highness.

272
00:12:28,375 --> 00:12:29,416
Mm?

273
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:31,166
Prince Zen, are you
feeling fatigued?

274
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:34,166
No, not really.

275
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,000
Mitsuhide.

276
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,333
Sir?

277
00:12:36,416 --> 00:12:39,458
[ZEN] What do you see
when you look at me?

278
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,083
I'd say you looked fatigued.

279
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:42,000
[ZEN]
Not like that.

280
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:43,833
I'm asking on a deeper level.

281
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:48,375
On a deeper level? Well, then.

282
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,208
I adore you.

283
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:51,416
[ZEN gasping]

284
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:53,958
[KIKI] Shall I make a
record of that statement?

285
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,791
No, of course not!

286
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,250
[MITSUHIDE]
Is something wrong?

287
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,333
Don't worry about it.

288
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,083
[RYU]
Mm?

289
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:12,166
Shirayuki. That girl
never stops.

290
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Hm... So the medicine

291
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:17,583
is extracted from the
blue flower petals, then?

292
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,291
But it doesn't
have blue petals,

293
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:23,000
and none that I tested
produced any real reaction.

294
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:26,875
[SHIRAYUKI] I hope Mitsuhide
and Zen are getting along.

295
00:13:26,958 --> 00:13:28,916
I hate it when they
fight too much.

296
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:33,875
[gasps] Is tonight
the full moon?

297
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:35,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Now that I think about it,

298
00:13:35,583 --> 00:13:39,916
I've read that the moon
can affect some plants.

299
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,416
Maybe that's it.

300
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,500
[ZEN]
Shirayuki.

301
00:13:49,583 --> 00:13:52,208
[SHIRAYUKI]
Ah! Zen!

302
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,541
Hi.

303
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,250
I'm sorry if I made you jump.

304
00:13:55,333 --> 00:13:58,958
I went to see you, and Ryu
told me you were here.

305
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:01,708
Incredible. Are all these
books about medicine?

306
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yeah, for the most part.

307
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:06,708
[ZEN] That's amazing.
I just wanted to see you.

308
00:14:06,791 --> 00:14:09,500
But by all means keep
doing what you were.

309
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:12,250
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen?

310
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,541
[ZEN]
Mm-hm?

311
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:14,958
[SHIRAYUKI]
The other day,

312
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:18,833
why did you tell Mitsuhide
to do whatever he wanted?

313
00:14:18,916 --> 00:14:20,541
Oh, that.

314
00:14:20,625 --> 00:14:24,458
Because he was treating me
like I was on a pedestal.

315
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:27,041
Most of the time people act
a certain way towards me.

316
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,416
They acquiesce
because I'm royalty.

317
00:14:29,500 --> 00:14:32,041
I'm always
hyper-aware of that.

318
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:34,666
But I know that some
people treat me well

319
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:38,083
for reasons beyond
my royal status.

320
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:45,125
[ZEN] Mitsuhide and the others
who serve me just treat me

321
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:49,041
like a person, and I love
and respect them for that.

322
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,500
Yesterday, he was
acting like someone

323
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:53,500
who doesn't see
me as a person.

324
00:14:53,583 --> 00:14:56,125
Plus, my pride got
the better of me.

325
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,416
[SHIRAYUKI] Sometimes when
you're around Mistuhide,

326
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,583
you turn into a child
again, don't you?

327
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,916
What?!

328
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,000
You should put your friendship
before your pride.

329
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:07,750
As prince and attendant,
for sure. But beyond that...

330
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:10,083
Mitsuhide is important to you.

331
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,958
[gasps]

332
00:15:14,083 --> 00:15:15,041
[BOTH gasp]

333
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,041
What happened?

334
00:15:18,125 --> 00:15:20,333
I think maybe the
ladder fell over.

335
00:15:20,416 --> 00:15:22,708
[exhales] You all right--?

336
00:15:22,791 --> 00:15:24,125
[gasps]

337
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:25,583
[SHIRAYUKI whimpers]

338
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,541
Zen!

339
00:15:30,625 --> 00:15:32,708
Keep your head down!

340
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,625
Are you okay? Zen, Shirayuki?

341
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:45,375
That was impressive.

342
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,750
You didn't get hurt, did you?
Both of you are well?

343
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:48,750
Yes.

344
00:15:48,833 --> 00:15:50,750
He seemed normal
for a second, huh?

345
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,958
[MITSUHIDE]
Uh?

346
00:15:52,041 --> 00:15:53,500
[SHIRAYUKI]
Thank you for shielding us.

347
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,833
I'm glad you were here.

348
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:57,833
[ZEN] What about you.
How's your back?

349
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:58,833
Fine.

350
00:15:58,916 --> 00:16:00,208
Why were you here?

351
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:01,708
[MITSUHIDE]
I couldn't find you anywhere,

352
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:03,416
and this is the last
place I looked.

353
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:06,958
I was worried about you because
I knew you've been tired.

354
00:16:07,041 --> 00:16:09,333
I see.

355
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,000
Shirayuki.

356
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:13,541
Uh...

357
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,583
It's just like you said before.

358
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,000
I have to forget my pride.

359
00:16:18,083 --> 00:16:21,000
I want you to heal Mitsuhide.

360
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,875
Then, I will do everything
in my power, Zen.

361
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,166
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

362
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,541
[BOTH]
Uh?

363
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,375
[ZEN]
What is it, Shirayuki?

364
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,750
[SHIRAYUKI] I thought I would
try exposing it to the moon.

365
00:16:35,833 --> 00:16:37,458
The properties of some
plants change when

366
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,208
they're under its light, so
I figured it was worth a try.

367
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:44,208
I didn't know this was one
of them, but I'm so glad!

368
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,041
I can make the
antidote from this!

369
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:50,416
And then, Mitsuhide can go
back to his normal self!

370
00:16:51,458 --> 00:16:52,708
Master.

371
00:16:52,791 --> 00:16:54,083
[KIKI]
Where's Mitsuhide?

372
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:56,083
[ZEN]
I left him with Shirayuki.

373
00:16:56,166 --> 00:16:58,458
She's finally found
a way to cure him.

374
00:16:58,541 --> 00:17:01,000
[KIKI] So you decided
to stop being stubborn?

375
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,708
[ZEN] I realized my pride
was just getting in the way.

376
00:17:03,791 --> 00:17:05,583
We're friends, after all.

377
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:09,041
That's why we always stick
by you, Zen. No matter what.

378
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,625
It's the truth, and it looks
like Shirayuki abides

379
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:15,416
by the same code as us,
through thick and thin.

380
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,250
[KIKI]
Your Highness.

381
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:25,500
You still have a lot
to learn, don't you?

382
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:29,041
Ha, ha!

383
00:17:29,125 --> 00:17:30,916
I do.

384
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:36,416
[SHIRAYUKI]
Mitsuhide!

385
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:39,458
The chief herbalist is
finished checking my work.

386
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:41,416
The antidote's ready for you.

387
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,791
It's going to make you sleepy,

388
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:45,000
but I'll check on your
progress through the night.

389
00:17:45,083 --> 00:17:47,791
When you wake up tomorrow,
you'll be back to normal.

390
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:49,583
I hope so.

391
00:17:53,333 --> 00:17:55,750
[MITSUHIDE] I know I've annoyed
Zen these past few days,

392
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:57,708
and I've been kind of at a loss.

393
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,416
It's been difficult
for me to navigate.

394
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:01,541
I can imagine.

395
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,583
[gasps]

396
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:04,916
[MITSUHIDE]
Your hands are so pretty.

397
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,166
Ah! Really?

398
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:10,708
Oh, sorry. I didn't mean
anything weird by that.

399
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:13,083
When I heard that Prince Zen
had offered you his hand,

400
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:14,625
and that you'd taken it,

401
00:18:14,708 --> 00:18:17,208
I realized that meant he
had finally found someone

402
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:18,291
that he could trust.

403
00:18:18,375 --> 00:18:21,083
I can't tell you
how happy I was.

404
00:18:24,875 --> 00:18:26,791
I'm grateful.

405
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:32,541
So you should know, I will
always be your ally.

406
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:34,208
The path ahead...

407
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:38,041
It will be difficult because of
the fact that Zen is a prince.

408
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,916
Shirayuki, I want you to
be sure of your decision.

409
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,791
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

410
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:52,375
[yawns]

411
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,375
Color has meaning.

412
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:06,250
And red is supposed
to represent fate.

413
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:11,083
My fate. Is this it?

414
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:16,833
[GARAK] Shirayuki is a really
hard worker, isn't she?

415
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,833
I can't believe she finished
the antidote so quickly.

416
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,083
[RYU]
Mm. She's quite dependable.

417
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,958
Looks like we finally found
someone you can trust.

418
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,708
[RYU]
Uh!

419
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,333
[ZEN]
What?! He doesn't remember?

420
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:33,291
Yeah, he's back to normal.

421
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:36,250
But he says the days he
was hypnotized are a blur.

422
00:19:36,333 --> 00:19:37,833
So, uh.

423
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,041
It sounds like I caused quite
a bit of trouble around here.

424
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,958
Dare I ask what I did?

425
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,208
[ZEN growls]

426
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,291
[MITSUHIDE] I'm sorry
for whatever it was! Uh.

427
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:46,958
How's your neck, by the way?

428
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:49,000
It healed a long time ago!

429
00:19:49,083 --> 00:19:51,166
[OBI]
Oh, don't you worry, Master.

430
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:53,125
I had a feeling
this might happen.

431
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:54,833
So I took it upon
myself to write down

432
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:57,291
pretty much everything he
said for the past few days.

433

[MITSUHIDE]
Uh.

434
00:19:58,208 --> 00:19:59,666
Here's an example:

435
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:02,333
when you bumped into Miss Kiki
while entering Zen's office,

436
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:03,708
you gently took her hand

437
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,708
and gazed lovingly into
her eyes and said,

438
00:20:06,791 --> 00:20:11,041
"Kiki. Did I cause any injury
to your lovely, glorious hand?

439
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:15,083
Good morning. You look more
beautiful than ever today."

440

[MITSUHIDE gasping]
Wait, what?!

441
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,583
Is that true, Kiki?!

442
00:20:20,666 --> 00:20:22,708
Why the hell do you look
so indifferent about it?!

443
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,458
Oh, this one's my favorite.

444
00:20:24,541 --> 00:20:26,166
[MITSUHIDE] No, that's enough,

Fine. Thanks to

Well, little genius. Are you
finished with your report?

[SHIRAYUKI]
Uh. I am! I have it right here!

00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,458
Huh.

Good, this is excellent.

[SHIRAYUKI]
Yes?

Huh?!

Now, with this report approved,

I announce the completion of
Shirayuki's apprenticeship!

From this day forward,

Thanks so much, Kiki!

Uh! Ryu!

Uh, I'm happy for you.

Thanks!

Honestly.

474
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:40,250
I had no idea you were
still an apprentice at all.

475
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:42,375
It just seems kind
of weird, doesn't it?

476
00:21:42,458 --> 00:21:43,875
You've been around a while.

477
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:45,541
[SHIRAYUKI]
Yeah, I guess so.

478
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:48,791
When I really stop to think of
my time here in those terms,

479
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:53,083
it has been a while since I came
to the castle and met you all.

480
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:58,541
Shirayuki. This is great.

481
00:21:58,625 --> 00:22:00,000
[SHIRAYUKI]
Zen.

482
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,791
You predicted it that day.

483
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:04,583
There was something
that you wanted to do.

484
00:22:04,666 --> 00:22:07,541
And you did it on your own,
just like you said.

485
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,666
You made your own
wish come true.

486
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,250
[SHIRAYUKI gasps]

487
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:15,958
[MITSUHIDE] Shirayuki, I want
you to be sure of your decision.

488
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,291
Really consider it.

489
00:22:17,375 --> 00:22:21,125
And decide if the place
where Zen will take you...

490
00:22:21,208 --> 00:22:24,708
...is also a place
where you wish to be.

491
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,083
[IZANA]
How would you like things to be

492
00:24:05,166 --> 00:24:07,041
between you and Zen?

493
00:24:07,125 --> 00:24:09,125
[OBI] I've never seen
that expression before.

494
00:24:09,208 --> 00:24:12,333
[RAJ] I feel like my current
relationship with you isn't bad.

495
00:24:12,416 --> 00:24:13,333
[OBI]
That's my job.

496
00:24:13,416 --> 00:24:15,083
Wait here, Miss.
