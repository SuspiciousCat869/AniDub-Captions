[LAWRENCE gasping]

2
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,958
Chroniclers?

3
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:33,375
Do you mean those people

4
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,583
who keep journals and
the town records and whatnot?

5
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,958
I'd rather think of
it as history than "whatnot."

6
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:41,083
Fine job that would be
to sit on your arse all day

7
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:44,333
scribbling words on parchment
for nobles and churchmen,

8
00:02:44,416 --> 00:02:46,333
then collecting money for it.

9
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:49,166
Chroniclers also write down
legends and old stories.

10
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,625
I'm more interested in those.

11
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,625
Really?

12
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,000
To be more specific,
I'm travelling north.

13
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:58,583
Learning the roads beforehand
would be beneficial.

14
00:02:58,666 --> 00:03:00,500
Setting new trade routes?

15
00:03:00,583 --> 00:03:02,583
If only I were.
No. I'm afraid this is simply

16
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,500
a personal obligation
of no particular profit.

17
00:03:05,583 --> 00:03:07,541
Sounds like you
found a new hobby.

18
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,375
It found me.

19
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:11,083
So what's your advice?

20
00:03:11,166 --> 00:03:13,375
You'd want a Lohen
guild member, no doubt.

21
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:15,125
Well, do you know anyone?

22
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,125
A merchant of my class will
know one of almost everything.

23
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:19,416
This one'll be on the house.

24
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:21,666
And then I shall be
in your debt, my friend.

25
00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:25,375
There is a certain trader
I know named Gee Batos

26
00:03:25,458 --> 00:03:27,875
who has been dealing in metals
around these parts for years.

27
00:03:27,958 --> 00:03:30,958
He is not someone
to go trifling with.

28
00:03:31,041 --> 00:03:35,000
It'd be a good idea not to get
mixed up with his associates.

29
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:42,041
Do you intend
simply to watch me eat?

30
00:03:42,125 --> 00:03:44,875
I do, because I ate
on the way back.

31
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:46,666
What are you reading?

32
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:48,291
They're letters...

33
00:03:48,375 --> 00:03:50,750
I received them when
I was buying your bread.

34
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:54,291
Marc's new apprentice
brought them to me.

35
00:03:54,375 --> 00:03:55,791
What is it they are saying?

36
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:56,875
See for yourself.

37
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,916
They're pretty funny.

38
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,541
I have not yet
learned to read.

39
00:04:07,625 --> 00:04:09,083
Surely you must be joking.

40
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,000
Those funny little
runes mean nothing at all

41
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,000
until you put them
in specific combinations

42
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,750
of which there
are far too many.

43
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,833
You must have tried
to learn at some point.

44
00:04:17,916 --> 00:04:19,708
Yes, but I decided to quit.

45
00:04:19,791 --> 00:04:22,708
I do not need your
letters to find my prey.

46
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:25,125
Well, tell me what
the foolish words say,

47
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:27,250
"Military expediation to
the north has been cancelled

48
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:33,166
so use caution in your trade
for weapons and armor."

49
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,166
A lot of good that does us.

50
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:36,958
Well, that's the truth...

51
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,500
Without the right information,

52
00:04:38,583 --> 00:04:41,000
a merchant is like a blind
soldier on the battlefield.

53
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,875
Do not forget.

54
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:46,083
The festival begins today.

55
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:52,500
I'm sorry, but there's
someplace else I have to go.

56
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:55,875
I know you don't mean it
so please stop doing that.

57
00:04:55,958 --> 00:04:58,333
You have such a weak heart
for little girls who cry.

58
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:00,125
I will keep that in mind.

59
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:02,083
Oh, good.

60
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:04,500
Would it be alright with you if
I went by myself?

61
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:07,833
Why even ask?
You're going anyway.

62
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:10,708
You could pretend with me.

63
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:13,916
Please spend it wisely.

64
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,166
You are truly a good man!

65
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,583
Now that isn't
a Trenni silver piece

66
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:19,250
so it's fine to use
on little things

67
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:21,583
because it's not worth
nearly as much as most.

68
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,916
I hope you have
a wonderful time.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,708
What's the matter?

70
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:27,291
On second thought,

71
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,791
it might not be any fun
to be there all alone.

72
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:32,500
If you let me come with
you I'll give your coin back.

73
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:34,208
What business is it anyway?

74
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,583
It's nothing.

75
00:05:35,666 --> 00:05:36,958
I just have to go meet

76
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:39,000
another member of
my guild, that's all.

77
00:05:39,083 --> 00:05:40,500
[BOY LAWRENCE]
And then?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,833
If you do not think
you should be seen with me

79
00:05:44,916 --> 00:05:47,625
I do not mind
staying out of sight.

80
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:51,083
There cannot be any harm
done if I am invisible.

81
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:54,208
I still can't
take you with me.

82
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:55,375
It's not just a meeting.

83
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,625
We may have to go
somewhere as well.

84
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,083
If I let you come along

85
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:01,875
you'd have to sit
outside the entire time.

86
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:03,416
I promise I'll spend
the day with you tomorrow

87
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:07,416
so I want you to do your best
to suffer through it today.

88
00:06:10,916 --> 00:06:12,208
Fine...

89
00:06:12,291 --> 00:06:14,291
I would never
desire our friendship

90
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,041
to become an
obstacle to your business.

91
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:19,083
I will find a way to
manage on my own somehow.

92
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,041
I'm sorry.

93
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:23,291
Lawrence?

94
00:06:23,375 --> 00:06:25,375
If I have someone in
the room when you get back

95
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:28,416
would you mind turning around
and taking a little walk?

96
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,041
The look on
your face right now

97
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:32,791
will keep me company
for the rest of the day.

98
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:35,000
Have a good meeting.

99
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,458
What look?

100
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:38,166
Do not worry.

101
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:40,125
I desire no more
than your presence.

102
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:42,250
So please hurry back home.

103
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,416
[BARTENDER]
He's not here yet,

104
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,958
but he'll arrive soon.

105
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,958
Look for a man the size
of a walking coffin.

106
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,958
I guess this guy's
rather large then?

107
00:06:51,041 --> 00:06:53,458
[BARTENDER] He is.

108
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:56,875
[LAWRENCE] Thanks
again for the room.

109
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,333
[AMARTY]
Don't mention it.

110
00:06:58,416 --> 00:06:59,958
You must have
really liked the fish

111
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,416
since you ordered so much.

112
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,250
My picky friend praised it,
which happens rarely.

113
00:07:03,333 --> 00:07:06,333
She tells me you know what
you're doing choosing fish.

114
00:07:06,416 --> 00:07:08,750
Then I'm certain to buy more
like those in the future.

115
00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:10,083
Be sure to
tell her how much

116
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,125
it pleased me that
it made her happy.

117
00:07:12,208 --> 00:07:14,500
She said it was the best
carp she's ever had.

118
00:07:14,583 --> 00:07:16,833
More carp it is then,
thank you very much.

119
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:20,125
Well now, what's
on your agenda next?

120
00:07:20,208 --> 00:07:22,500
I have a meeting
with a man named Batos.

121
00:07:22,583 --> 00:07:24,708
Oh, that's too bad.

122
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:26,708
And why is that?

123
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,500
I wanted to show you around.

124
00:07:28,583 --> 00:07:30,416
I'm sure we both have
useful information

125
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,541
we could share with
each other and who knows

126
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:34,333
we might even strike
a business deal.

127
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:37,000
I thought
Miss Holo might join us.

128
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,875
She has been
pestering me to take her

129
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:41,166
on the grand tour ever
since this morning.

130
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,833
I know...

131
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:47,541
If you'd like, I could
take Holo around with me.

132
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:50,458
To be honest, I have
nothing on the books today

133
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,916
so she'd be
a welcome distraction.

134
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,625
I would hate to
waste your time.

135
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,791
Not at all, the
truth is that if I don't go

136
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:58,791
I'll probably spend
all my money in here.

137
00:07:58,875 --> 00:08:00,166
Well alright then,

138
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:02,000
but she might have
left the inn already.

139
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,666
I'll stop by and see
if she's around.

140
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,125
Besides, I need to check up
on their inventory anyway.

141
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,875
I really appreciate it.

142
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,750
Of course.

143
00:08:12,875 --> 00:08:16,500
Promise you'll come
with us next time, okay?

144
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,791
[BATOS] You're Craft
Lawrence, aren't you?

145
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,666
I am.

146
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:27,625
[BATOS] It's a pleasure
to meet you.

147
00:08:27,708 --> 00:08:30,916
My name is Ghe Batos.

148
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,041
You want information
about the north, right?

149
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:34,125
I do.

150
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:37,375
That doesn't
happen too often.

151
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,083
So is it a lead on
some big business deal?

152
00:08:40,166 --> 00:08:45,250
Not quite... I'm afraid
it's for personal reasons.

153
00:08:48,166 --> 00:08:50,333
You surprise me
for such a young man.

154
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,333
My interest in legends only
came on as I began to age.

155
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,083
I've travelled for decades
into every region I believed

156
00:08:57,166 --> 00:08:59,500
could be profitable
for a merchant like me

157
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:01,750
and I thought
I knew them all.

158
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,500
But one day
I started to think

159
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,375
of the time before
all of this...

160
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:07,041
A time hundreds
of years ago

161
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,083
when people
exactly like you and me

162
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:10,625
were travelling this land.

163
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,458
I realized I knew
nothing about it.

164
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:14,375
I can't walk into the past

165
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,083
as I do from town to town,

166
00:09:16,166 --> 00:09:19,000
and at my age those distances
get longer every year.

167
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,166
However, even though
my legs might be getting older,

168
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,291
I can still travel
through stories in my mind

169
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:27,625
and that's where
the study of legends came in.

170
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,791
The people from the past
aren't here to teach us anymore,

171
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,875
but they did
leave behind stories.,,

172
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:34,666
and those stories
are as real

173
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:37,083
as the mouths
that first spoke them

174
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:38,458
and the hands that
wrote them down...

175
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,500
Yes, I believe I know
what you're saying.

176
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,375
The people who
live in this area

177
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,791
aren't highly regarded
by the rest of the town.

178
00:09:46,875 --> 00:09:48,541
They're the sort of
people that would be hanged

179
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:52,375
by the church if
they could find them,

180
00:09:52,458 --> 00:09:55,208
so they avoid towns
like Lubinheigen.

181
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,416
What's that smell?

182
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,083
That has got to be sulfur.

183
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,916
Quite a nose you've got.

184
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,333
You must be an
impressive merchant

185
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,583
if you can identify
mixtures by smell.

186
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:11,916
The primary
purpose of this wall

187
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,583
is to keep that
odor from wafting

188
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:16,625
into the rest of the town
and causing illness.

189
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,916
There are an awful
lot of birds here.

190
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,833
Yeah, people breed
them as warnings

191
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,166
because the toxic air
isn't always so pungent.

192
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,625
If the birds die,
it's time to go.

193
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:29,916
The air is like
the "hand of death"

194
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,541
they told us
about in church.

195
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:33,291
I can almost picture it

196
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,791
lurking around every
corner in this place.

197
00:10:35,875 --> 00:10:37,625
Do you have any idea
how many alchemists

198
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:39,416
are living in this section?

199
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,625
Let me see...

200
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,250
if you count all
of their apprentices

201
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,166
I think it's
somewhere around 20.

202
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,333
But it's hard to say
with any real certainty.

203
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,916
Accidents are pretty
commonplace around here.

204
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,083
What profit is there between
merchants and alchemists?

205
00:10:53,166 --> 00:10:54,750
You have to get
rid of the notion

206
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:56,666
that alchemists
are like magicians.

207
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:58,500
They simply study
the art of manipulating

208
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,291
metals with heat or acid.

209
00:11:00,375 --> 00:11:02,333
That said...

210
00:11:02,416 --> 00:11:04,583
I will not deny that there
are those in this district

211
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:08,291
who pursue the study
of darker arts.

212
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,375
Of course those are only
the rumors I've heard.

213
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:17,833
All the contacts I've ever
dealt with in this part of town

214
00:11:17,916 --> 00:11:20,333
have been good
and decent people.

215
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:22,125
I'm certainly
glad to hear that.

216
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,291
At any rate, they're
clients I'm working with.

217
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,250
It's not good for business

218
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,958
to go around passing
judgment on them.

219
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:32,791
There's no need for
you to be on edge.

220
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,000
My contact here
is very amiable.

221
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,333
Okay.

222
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,333
Is anyone here?

223
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,375
[birds cawing]

224
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,750
[door creaking open]

225
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,916
[DIANA] It's so good
to see you, Batos.

226
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,541
The feeling is mutual...

227
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,291
You look to be doing
quite well today.

228
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:01,541
And you appear
as healthy as an ox.

229
00:12:01,625 --> 00:12:03,541
Is this handsome
boy a gift for me?

230
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:04,791
From his quivering,

231
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,916
I'd say he's terribly
afraid I'm a witch.

232
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,833
I could always
introduce you

233
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,541
as the Queen of
the Underworld.

234
00:12:10,625 --> 00:12:11,958
Oh please don't.

235
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:14,833
There's enough darkness
around here without that.

236
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:17,708
Do you really think a witch
could be this beautiful?

237
00:12:17,791 --> 00:12:19,708
I have heard of many women
being called witches

238
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,916
because of their
unmatched beauty.

239
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,333
Ever the flatterer.

240
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,041
I'm sure it's gotten you

241
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,083
into a few beds
from time to time.

242
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:29,666
Anyway old friend,
this is a colleague of mine.

243
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,750
Hello.

244
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:32,291
My name is Craft Lawrence

245
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,458
and I'm a Lohen
Guild merchant.

246
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:36,000
Is there a chance
Dian Rubens is available?

247
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:38,291
Batos, you didn't tell him?

248
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:42,458
My name is Dian Rubens.

249
00:12:42,541 --> 00:12:44,666
A manly name,
don't you think?

250
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:47,000
I don't know...
but it suits you.

251
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:49,875
My friends call me
Diana, as should you.

252
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:57,666
[DIANA] So tell me of this
interest you have with me.

253
00:12:57,750 --> 00:12:59,375
I'm sorry for insisting

254
00:12:59,458 --> 00:13:00,958
to see you on
such short notice.

255
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:01,875
Mrs. Rubens, I've heard
you might ha--

256
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:05,083
Diana, please.

257
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,083
Of course,
please forgive me.

258
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:08,625
Not at all.

259
00:13:08,708 --> 00:13:10,666
To get right to it, I'm
here because I've been told

260
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:13,083
you have great knowledge
of the Northern Legends.

261
00:13:13,166 --> 00:13:14,291
Is that so?

262
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:15,500
Yes.

263
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:17,291
I thought this
was to be business.

264
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:19,625
No, it's a social call!

265
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:23,375
It's possible I know the story
for which you're searching.

266
00:13:23,458 --> 00:13:25,291
There is a village
name in the legend...

267
00:13:25,375 --> 00:13:28,416
I couldn't be
entirely certain

268
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,083
but I believe
it's called Yoitz.

269
00:13:30,166 --> 00:13:32,208
The Moon Hunting Bear,
it's told,

270
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,875
destroyed that village.

271
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:38,166
Let's see, I believe
I put that one over here.

272
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,791
Ahh yes, this is the one.

273
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,083
The Moon Hunting Bear

274
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:44,625
also called "Irawa
Wir Muheidehende."

275
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,958
Yes, this creature did
destroy a town called Yoitz.

276
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:50,125
These are some
old legends indeed...

277
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,458
but there are a few ones about
the Moon Hunting Bear in here...

278
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:55,708
Is that all?

279
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:58,583
Well... Well, I'm looking
for the location of Yoitz.

280
00:13:58,666 --> 00:14:00,125
Does it say in your story?

281
00:14:00,208 --> 00:14:02,291
Wait. You're trying
to find Yoitz?

282
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:05,625
Yes, I have my reasons
for wanting to know.

283
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,791
I can't think.

284
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:08,750
Where was it.

285
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:10,791
Where is it?

286
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,000
I...

287
00:14:18,250 --> 00:14:19,583
Yes, I remember now.

288
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,166
At the base of
the Rohm River

289
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:23,041
some ways
north of Proania

290
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:24,875
there is a town
called Laynos.

291
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:26,250
Do you know it?

292
00:14:26,333 --> 00:14:28,083
Yes, they trade in fur
and lumber mostly.

293
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,916
There is a strange
tale from those parts.

294
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,083
The legend tells of
a giant wolf that appeared

295
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:36,083
in the village one
day many, many years ago.

296
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:40,125
This wolf went by
the name Holo of Yoitz.

297
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,291
You had to stretch
your neck to look at her.

298
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:43,916
The villagers thought
she was a curse from God,

299
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,000
but Holo told them
she had only come

300
00:14:46,083 --> 00:14:47,708
from the forests in the east.

301
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,458
Her journey to the south

302
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:51,083
had brought her
through their town.

303
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:52,625
They tell of her taking
the form of a young woman,

304
00:14:52,708 --> 00:14:54,041
her love of drink,

305
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:56,458
and how she would dance
with the other girls.

306
00:14:56,541 --> 00:14:58,833
She looked in every
way like a beautiful maiden

307
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:00,541
with one exception,
her wolf's tail.

308
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:01,916
After she left,
the village

309
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,583
had abundant harvests
for many years.

310
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:07,375
They called her
Holo of the Wheaten Tail.

311
00:15:07,458 --> 00:15:10,375
That's all. I trust
that was helpful.

312
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,416
Yes, it was...

313
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:14,625
Between Laynos and
the forests of the east

314
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:17,750
it is almost all
a complete wilderness now.

315
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:19,916
But you've given me
a starting point.

316
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,875
I am very pleased
to hear it.

317
00:15:21,958 --> 00:15:22,916
I will repay the kindness
as soon as I can.

318
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:24,958
Well since you
feel so strongly,

319
00:15:25,041 --> 00:15:27,250
there is nothing
that could repay me more

320
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,416
than hearing a good
pagan story of your own.

321
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,500
I have had my run ins
with the church,

322
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,750
so I prefer those
firsthand accounts

323
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:35,333
that remain unspoiled
by her influence.

324
00:15:35,416 --> 00:15:37,458
You've obviously
travelled much.

325
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,875
I'm certain there's
at least one story

326
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:44,291
you can think of that
would settle your debt.

327
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:45,666
Perhaps you would be
willing to tell it to me?

328
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,875
As you wish.

329
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:50,083
I tell of a wheat farming
region in the south.

330
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,583
Where the harvests have
a wonderful festival subject

331
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,625
to the attention of
a certain large wolf.

332
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:57,708
It seems like
it's been forever

333
00:15:57,791 --> 00:15:59,166
since I've been this excited

334
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:01,583
about legends of old
regarding wolves or dragons.

335
00:16:01,666 --> 00:16:04,166
I think I spent the majority
of my afternoons as a kid

336
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:06,208
dreaming up tales like these,

337
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:08,291
which is
probably why I travel.

338
00:16:08,375 --> 00:16:10,958
I wonder why we ever
stop believing in them?

339
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,125
Hey, you're back finally.

340
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:32,083
There's a town called Laynos
upstream on the Rohm, right?

341
00:16:32,166 --> 00:16:33,625
That's way too much.

342
00:16:33,708 --> 00:16:34,708
Okay, sorry about that.

343
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:35,791
Darn straight.

344
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,083
I've got some
information for you

345
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,750
about that town Nyohila.

346
00:16:38,833 --> 00:16:41,208
Sorry, that may not
be important now.

347
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:44,750
So tell me,
is it true that you

348
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,333
got in a quarrel
with your companion then?

349
00:16:46,416 --> 00:16:48,041
No, I don't think so.

350
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,000
No need to play
coy with us, Lawrence.

351
00:16:50,083 --> 00:16:51,791
We all know you've got
a beautiful nun locked up

352
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,958
in that room of yours
for who knows what.

353
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,916
Well, I say good for you.

354
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,833
You don't even
fear God himself.

355
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:01,708
My travelling companion and I
have a unique relationship.

356
00:17:01,791 --> 00:17:03,583
What did you mean by quarrel?

357
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,041
I don't know.

358
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,958
I heard she was
roaming the town

359
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:08,791
with a boy from your guild.

360
00:17:08,875 --> 00:17:10,166
She wouldn't be doing that

361
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,750
if everything was fine
between the two of you.

362
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,333
They seemed to be having
a great time together, though.

363
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,083
Oh, Amarty... he's all right.

364
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:20,291
You're going to give
up just like that?

365
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:22,375
It's not what you think,
I had important business

366
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,250
that took me from her side
today, nothing scandalous.

367
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:27,208
His name's Amarty.

368
00:17:27,291 --> 00:17:29,458
He wanted to show her around,

369
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,541
so I went out and
did some business.

370
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:40,291
I wish I had a better story,
but that's all there is to it.

371
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:43,000
If I heard Adele was wandering
around town with Amarty

372
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,916
I'm not sure I could
be as calm as you.

373
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,708
In fact, I'd probably
be crawling out

374
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,291
of my skin right now.

375
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:50,708
[ADELE] If you'd worry,
you think me a whore.

376
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,750
I would never think
something like that.

377
00:17:52,833 --> 00:17:54,333
But you know
how hard it is for me

378
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
to keep up with all
these young merchants.

379
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:57,583
That is true.

380
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,625
He ran away from his home
at such a tender young age.

381
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:01,416
And already he's one of

382
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,125
the most successful
traders in town.

383
00:18:03,208 --> 00:18:05,041
Unlike someone I know.

384
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:07,458
Also, he is very kind-hearted.

385
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,791
Any woman I know could
fall in love with him.

386
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:11,333
You hear this?

387
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,291
I swear my heart is going to
burn up into a jealous fire.

388
00:18:14,375 --> 00:18:16,666
If it did I'd cook a nice
tasty pie for Amarty on it

389
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,875
and let him know
I was single again.

390
00:18:18,958 --> 00:18:20,333
Adele, stop!

391
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:25,416
[MARC] I'm only going
to tell you once

392
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,291
to watch your back with
a trader like Amarty

393
00:18:27,375 --> 00:18:29,166
When success comes
to them at such a young age

394
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:32,833
they think they're
entitled to anything.

395
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,416
I'm such a complete fool.

396
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,916
The Moon Hunting Bear

397
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,958
destroyed that
village, Lawrence.

398
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:52,583
It looks like you
had a good time...

399
00:18:52,666 --> 00:18:55,666
Where did Amarty run off to?

400
00:18:55,750 --> 00:18:58,500
I lost track of
him downstairs.

401
00:18:58,583 --> 00:19:01,166
You lost track of him,
that's great.

402
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:03,291
Did he buy that fur for you?

403
00:19:03,375 --> 00:19:05,458
Are you speaking?

404
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,666
I think I'm going to be sick.

405
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,208
Would you please at least
make yourself useful?

406
00:19:15,916 --> 00:19:18,625
Watch it. Hey.

407
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,166
Oh wrong way.

408
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,916
Wait!

409
00:19:31,708 --> 00:19:33,541
Festival.

410
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,958
Did your prince buy
anything else for you?

411
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,708
This truly is
a superior fur.

412
00:19:45,791 --> 00:19:48,083
Though it pales
in comparison to mine.

413
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,916
You do realize I'm now
indebted to that boy

414
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,958
because you accepted
his gift, don't you?

415
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,833
I was stupid
to think a night out

416
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:55,583
on your own would only
cost me one little coin.

417
00:19:55,666 --> 00:19:57,166
I knew you were just
trying to get rid of me.

418
00:19:57,250 --> 00:20:00,875
I had spending
money for you,

419
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,000
but now I suppose
I'll have to use that

420
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:07,083
to pay Amarty
back for the fur.

421
00:20:07,166 --> 00:20:09,250
Did he ask what
our story was?

422
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,458
Why would you
want to know that?

423
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,166
I don't want people
to get suspicious of us.

424
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,666
I told him I was
a wandering nun

425
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,208
who was kidnapped
by illegal slave traders,

426
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,000
and you had rescued me only
moments before I was sold.

427
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:25,166
That's perfect.

428
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,458
I further explained
since I had no way to repay

429
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,666
such a large debt
to my gallant hero

430
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:32,500
that I was praying for your
safe journey in lieu of money

431
00:20:32,583 --> 00:20:34,750
since prayers are
the only possessions

432
00:20:34,833 --> 00:20:36,750
I have in the world.
Boo hoo hoo.

433
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,875
Must you always
be so dramatic?

434
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,333
It was after I told
him the woeful tale

435
00:20:40,416 --> 00:20:42,583
of Holo the Nun that
he bought me this wrap.

436
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:45,791
Well, that's okay I guess.

437
00:20:45,875 --> 00:20:47,166
Tell me, what is this?

438
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,208
It is a magic
fortune telling cube.

439
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:51,666
The shape is expertly
crafted, is it not?

440
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:53,250
I am sure it will
fetch a good price

441
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,000
if we sell it on our way.

442
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,541
Fool.

443
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,791
What makes you
think this will sell?

444
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:01,291
It's only a naturally
occurring rock.

445
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:03,875
There's not anything
man-made about it.

446
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:08,250
It's not used for very much
except being sold as a toy.

447
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:12,125
Can your little ears
tell that I'm not lying?

448
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,083
It looks like gold so
it's popular with fools.

449
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:16,583
You didn't happen to see

450
00:21:16,666 --> 00:21:18,041
anyone else
buying these, did you?

451
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:20,375
A whole crowd of people
as a matter of fact.

452
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:21,666
Tell me.

453
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:23,333
A fortune teller
was using these

454
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:25,708
to divine and she
was eerily accurate.

455
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:27,666
Her skills impressed even me,
which is no small feat.

456
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,083
These can be used

457
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,875
for all sorts
of things according to her.

458
00:21:30,958 --> 00:21:32,041
This cheap little rock?

459
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,333
Yes.

460
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:34,583
She said it drives away demons,
heals any ailment,

461
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:38,166
and can awaken
a lover's heart.

462
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:39,958
It's smart
moving people to buy

463
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,750
when they're in good
spirits at the festival.

464
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,416
A trading frenzy,
I've seen it happen before.

465
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,375
Amarty won that
for me at the auction.

466
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,958
There was an auction?

467
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:50,916
I had never seen
one of those before.

468
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,416
The yelling and screaming
was a little frightening.

469
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:56,833
So strange, humans.

470
00:21:56,916 --> 00:22:00,166
All for iron pyrite.

471
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:02,083
I'll bet Batos has
some connections

472
00:22:02,166 --> 00:22:04,458
that could make
this trend profitable.

473
00:22:05,041 --> 00:22:08,625
[knocking]

474
00:22:08,708 --> 00:22:10,541
I'm sorry to come
so early in the morning,

475
00:22:10,625 --> 00:22:12,041
