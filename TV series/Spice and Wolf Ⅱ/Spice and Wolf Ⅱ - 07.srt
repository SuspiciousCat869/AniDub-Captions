1
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,583
You know, this is not bad.

2
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,083
So you are awake.

3
00:02:56,166 --> 00:02:59,125
This is not bad at all.

4
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:10,166
Luckily in here I will
not be as cold as you.

5
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:13,791
Wow, that's great;
I'm really happy for you.

6
00:03:18,083 --> 00:03:21,000
It may help to
know I am still cold.

7
00:03:21,083 --> 00:03:23,583
Remember, I am more
delicate than you.

8
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,458
Geez.

9
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:29,250
Look, stew!

10
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,500
What?

11
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,625
It looks just like
the burnt part of a stew!

12
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,708
[stomach grumbling]

13
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,583
You say there is a variety

14
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:53,583
of high-proof alcohol
to be found in Laynos?

15
00:03:53,666 --> 00:03:54,791
That's right.

16
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:56,166
And they should
have plenty on hand,

17
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:58,250
in case we get
stranded by the snow.

18
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:01,250
Then I hope it
starts snowing harder.

19
00:04:01,333 --> 00:04:02,958
Of course you do.

20
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:10,375
There's just one thing...

21
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:13,458
Laynos is widely
known for its fur trade.

22
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,583
They might sell wolf fur.

23
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:18,916
Promise me you won't get upset.

24
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,958
Do you know that I am
often hunted by wolves?

25
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:28,833
And I am known to
sometimes hunt rats.

26
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:34,250
What I mean is that
hunting and being hunted

27
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:38,541
is quite normal to me,
why would I become upset?

28
00:04:38,625 --> 00:04:39,833
If you think about it, though,

29
00:04:39,916 --> 00:04:42,208
humans are the
incomprehensible ones.

30
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:46,583
After all, you trade
your own people, do you not?

31
00:04:46,666 --> 00:04:48,708
Are you talking
about slave traders?

32
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,791
It's a profitable
and very necessary trade.

33
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,416
Do you see how
you do not hesitate

34
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,291
to speak of this slavery?

35
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:59,041
Well, I share a similar
indifference to hunters.

36
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:03,083
However, you get anxious
around male hunters, do you not?

37
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:06,625
Especially when
they are hunting me.

38
00:05:06,708 --> 00:05:08,750
Yeah, I suppose I do...

39
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,166
I get kind of panicky.

40
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,583
With more feeling.

41
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,958
I get panicky.

42
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:16,833
And why do you?

43
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,000
I'd rather not say.

44
00:05:23,916 --> 00:05:25,541
Because you are embarrassed?!

45
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,583
What do you think?

46
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:47,625
Looks like they're in
the same line of work.

47
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:49,625
I think we still
have a little while to go

48
00:05:49,708 --> 00:05:51,541
before we get into town though.

49
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:52,916
All of these people...

50
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
Are they what you would
call a market for believers?

51
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,458
They would be gathered outside
a church if that were the case.

52
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,375
But it does seem
odd to be setting up

53
00:05:59,458 --> 00:06:01,583
shop right outside
of the town's walls.

54
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:04,458
I most certainly do not
believe they are doing business.

55
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:06,708
The good news is
the gates are still open.

56
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:11,041
That means whatever this
is isn't a political thing.

57
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,208
Apparently excitement
always follows us.

58
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:17,708
Which isn't exactly,
a good thing.

59
00:06:17,791 --> 00:06:19,666
Why are you making that face?

60
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,375
For your information,
I am quite aware

61
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,375
that you have been put
through extraordinary distress

62
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:25,333
after extraordinary distress

63
00:06:25,416 --> 00:06:26,791
since we began
travelling together.

64
00:06:26,875 --> 00:06:29,125
However, I do
hope you will remember

65
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:32,291
none of the trouble
we experienced was my fault.

66
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,166
For example...

67
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:37,250
Well, yes, I do suppose
that was partially my fault...

68
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:39,166
But if you were not so greedy,

69
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:41,041
it never would
have been an issue...

70
00:06:41,125 --> 00:06:42,875
The following disaster was due

71
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,291
solely to your
extensive greed...

72
00:06:44,375 --> 00:06:45,916
After that, you panicked

73
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,541
and can only blame
your failure on yourself...

74
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:48,875
Am I wrong?

75
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,166
The words you are speaking
make sense, but still...

76
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:53,291
Still what?

77
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,208
I'm just not entirely
convinced...

78
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,666
You may not be the direct cause

79
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,708
but you're most definitely a
common denominator.

80
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:00,916
It is far too easy for you to
avoid the obvious conclusion.

81
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,291
What does that mean?

82
00:07:03,375 --> 00:07:05,666
You only ever consider the way

83
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:08,083
in which you make a decision
when contemplating my choices.

84
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,083
That is why you are
always convinced

85
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:12,750
you are being fooled by me.

86
00:07:12,833 --> 00:07:14,333
That is not true.

87
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:18,625
Of course...
You must save face.

88
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:25,291
Shut up!

89
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:27,333
I think this means
you admit it!

90
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:34,666
I'm not admitting anything.

91
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,000
Well no.

92
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:39,958
Of course not.

93
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,791
I would like stew.

94
00:07:41,875 --> 00:07:45,458
That does sound good.
It is pretty cold.

95
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:47,416
We'll have to check
the price, then.

00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,583
When it comes to the
cream used to make it,

97
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:51,666
I would rather have
the really thick kind,

98
00:07:51,750 --> 00:07:54,666
you know, like what 
they use to make butter.

99
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:55,916
Yes! That sounds perfect!

Do you know, the
scent of milk to me

101
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,125
quite frequently
surpasses that of

102
00:07:59,208 --> 00:08:01,500
alcohol. Oh yeah? Well,
in that case you should try

103
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,958
putting it onto some
seasonal vegetables, then.

104
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,541
Cream mixed with vegetables?

105
00:08:04,625 --> 00:08:06,375
Why waste space with vegetables

106
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:09,541
when there could be so much meat
mixed with that tasty cream?

107
00:08:09,625 --> 00:08:11,125
Oh, my mouth is watering!

108
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,500
True.

109
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,291
Although some people
can't stand the thought of it.

110
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,666
Well, I haven't eaten it
in several hundred years,

111
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:19,375
so what do I know?

112
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:22,416
I'll have to discuss it
with my wallet first.

113
00:08:36,333 --> 00:08:38,666
This is your foreign merchant

We hand them out to

that pass through our town.

116
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,541
In order to conduct business,

117
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:44,333
it's imperative
that you have one.

118
00:08:44,416 --> 00:08:47,583
You only get one,
so don't lose it.

What is this?

Everyone has cheap

121

I do not assume I am better
than or superior to anyone else.

122
00:09:09,041 --> 00:09:10,000
Although, I would
imagine that trait

123

is common among every species,

124
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,000
even though it means
nothing in particular.

125
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,875
Right. Okay.

Between a weak member

the latter will always
be respected more.

129
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:26,125
Okay.

130
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,708
That's true...

131
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,000
If you think about a noble
without fame or fortune,

132

he's really only

133

On the other hand, a commoner
who does have fame and fortune

is going to be

Yes, there's two of us.

Would you rather stay with

I am cold so I would prefer

All right, suit yourself.

Then I'll go ahead and

You go in and deal
with the room.

You should ask the owner for a

00:13:16,166 --> 00:13:19,708
In fact, I doubt you
will ever find a buyer.

164
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:24,875
No one has purchased it
from you yet, have they?

165
00:13:24,958 --> 00:13:26,750
Not yet.

166
00:13:35,166 --> 00:13:39,333
Oh, please excuse me.

167
00:13:45,333 --> 00:13:47,416
So? What are you off to do now?

168
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:48,875
Well, my priority
is to find out

169
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,500
more information
about your hometown.

170
00:13:50,583 --> 00:13:54,583
The legends about me,
Yoitz, and what not?

171
00:13:54,666 --> 00:13:57,166
All of that,
especially the what not part.

172
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,708
So... we'll look for
chronicle writers.

173
00:13:59,791 --> 00:14:01,250
You can be in charge of that.

174
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:04,000
You seem to know more
about my stories than I do.

175
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:06,958
Is something the matter?

176
00:14:07,041 --> 00:14:08,291
No...

177
00:14:08,375 --> 00:14:09,708
I'm just well aware
of how you work.

178
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:13,208
Come on, tell me
what you know.

179
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,833
So there's this old saying...

180
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:17,500
Those who know how
things work will find work

181
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,291
and their employer
will never forget

182
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:22,250
why they were chosen for work.

183
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:23,625
That does make sense.

184
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:25,291
I imagine this saying is why
you always work so hard,

185
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:28,125
am I right about that?

186
00:14:28,208 --> 00:14:29,125
There is truth in everything,
especially old sayings.

187
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,666
If I were your
employer, Lawrence

188
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,416
I would give you a reward.

189
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,875
Is that so?

190
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,541
Take the hint...

191
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:41,166
Well, is there anything
specific that you desire?

192
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:46,083
Not especially.

193
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,041
Does it count if all I want
is for you to be happy?

194
00:14:50,125 --> 00:14:53,541
I do not appreciate being
treated like a child!

195
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:56,791
Children will behave if
you scold them, so...

196
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,500
You're worse than a child.

197
00:15:00,583 --> 00:15:01,958
Ready?

198
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:03,875
Let's go talk to that
old innkeeper first.

199
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:06,958
Somehow those guys
know everything.

200
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,708
Are you coming or not?

201
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,208
Yes.

202
00:15:10,291 --> 00:15:14,291
You should be more careful or
you'll end up in trouble!

203
00:15:14,875 --> 00:15:16,458
If I decided to clap now...

204
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:20,875
do you think the spell I cast
on you would be dispelled?

205
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,000
Hark! What am I doing here?

206
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:26,500
Oh, I remember now...

207
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,250
I am in a town called Laynos
which is famous for its fur.

208
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,375
I shall purchase
some of this fur

209
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,416
and move on to
the next town!

210
00:15:36,083 --> 00:15:37,375
I have wonderful news for you

211
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:38,750
o' travelling
merchant from afar...

212
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:40,000
I am blessed with a rare
and exceptional ability

213
00:15:40,083 --> 00:15:44,583
to determine a fur's quality!

214
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,166
Well you must certainly
have good eyes then...

215
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,208
however, how do your eyes fare

216
00:15:48,291 --> 00:15:50,250
when you're dealing with people?

217
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:53,750
I do not know...

218
00:15:53,833 --> 00:15:56,000
Unfortunately I have been
cursed with the dark magic.

219
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:59,666
In that case, I should
probably not clap my hands

220
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,166
to make sure the magic
remains effective.

221
00:16:02,250 --> 00:16:04,083
I already clapped once.

222
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,000
Does that mean this magic
of yours is wearing off?

223
00:16:06,083 --> 00:16:07,416
Yes.

224
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:10,416
If you could cast
another one on me,

225
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:12,875
I would be very
much appreciative.

226
00:16:17,041 --> 00:16:20,166
Consider yourself
under my spell.

227
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,666
C'mon. Let's go.

228
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:27,833
Ouch!

229
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:31,541
You see? My magic has
clearly overpowered you.

230
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:36,958
I think you are too powerful.
Very foolish.

231
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:48,666
What must I do to get you to
lose your composure again?

232
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,250
Eh, we'll see...

233
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:51,958
If you'd stop teasing me, maybe
I'd have the chance, you think?

234
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:57,750
I am probably wrong, but I think
your quips are getting faster.

235
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,333
Oh? Thanks.

236
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:01,875
You do know I was not at
all trying to compliment  you...

237
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:04,791
Have you been taking
remedial wit lessons?

238
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,041
No, actually it just
kind of came to me.

239
00:17:07,125 --> 00:17:11,541
Well... then there is
hope for you after all!

240
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:12,750
What?

241
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:15,166
I was trying to stop
teasing you... you like?

242
00:17:21,875 --> 00:17:23,583
Now what could be wrong?

243
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,208
See how you lie?

244
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:27,791
You, sir, are desperate for
me to tease you.

245
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:34,833
I still believe you
to be adorable.

246
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,375
Chronicle writers you say?

247
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,666
Yes.

248
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,125
Anyone who knows
legends from various towns

249
00:17:39,208 --> 00:17:41,041
would be fine though.

250
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,666
I happen to know
a man called Rigoro

251
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,750
and he happens to be
a chronicle writer too.

252
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,833
Unfortunately, he's involved
in the 50 man meeting.

253
00:17:49,916 --> 00:17:52,166
I don't think
he'll have time for you.

254
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,083
What's the 50 man meeting?

255
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:56,500
Didn't you see it when you
were entering the town?

256
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,000
I think I did.

257
00:17:58,083 --> 00:17:59,500
There were a group of people

258
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,166
who looked like merchants
gathered together.

259
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:04,000
Was that the meeting
you're talking about?

260
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,333
So... obviously...

261
00:18:07,416 --> 00:18:09,541
there's some kind of
complaint in this town?

262
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:12,500
Yeah, it's about the... fur.

263
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:15,583
About fur?

264
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,083
Rigoro is the secretary
of that meeting.

265
00:18:19,166 --> 00:18:20,166
However, there is someone else

266
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:22,875
who knows legends
and old stories...

267
00:18:22,958 --> 00:18:24,166
Volta, the old fur tanner,

268
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:27,000
knew a lot about that
kind of thing, but...

269
00:18:27,083 --> 00:18:28,416
Is there anyone else?

270
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:29,958
Anyone else uh...?

271
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,375
Oh yeah, that's right...

272
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:34,250
Well there is the old
man of the Ratton firm.

273
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:39,958
Wait-- 2 years ago we had a
really hot summer, and he died.

274
00:18:40,041 --> 00:18:43,583
How sad? Don't you think?

275
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:44,625
It's a shame when
our storytellers go

276
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:47,791
because the memories
die with them.

277
00:18:47,875 --> 00:18:50,750
All we have left are
what's written down.

278
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:57,041
So in other words,

279
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,708
we should probably meet
with Rigoro himself

280
00:18:59,791 --> 00:19:02,083
so we can see the
written records.

281
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:03,791
Probably, yeah.

282
00:19:03,875 --> 00:19:07,375
Time can turn even stone
buildings into dust.

283
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:10,000
Our memories don't
stand a chance.

284
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:13,958
It's frightening if
you think about it.

285
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:34,416
Hey, let's go get some food.

286
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:37,291
You do know the way to
my heart, don't you?

287
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,666
[EVE] Excuse me.

288
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:01,541
We are not as surprising
as all that, are we?

289
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:04,833
Do you think he knows
you're not human? Uh oh.

290
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:06,875
I did not get that
impression at all...

291
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,625
I think 'tis more
likely that girl

292
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:11,291
was simply overcome
by my stunning beauty.

293
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,625
'twould not
be the first time.

294
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:16,458
Doubtful. That girl?

295
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,708
She's a woman?

296
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:23,375
You dare to gawk at another
woman while you are with me?

297
00:20:23,458 --> 00:20:25,458
What are you planning?

298
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:28,000
I don't think I like it
when you're that direct...

299
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,666
You're much more attractive

300
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,708
when you show how you
feel with your attitude.

301
00:20:34,041 --> 00:20:35,666
I have found that
type of subtlety

302
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,916
does not quite get
through your thick skull.

303
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,416
So, what is it you want to do?

304
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,958
Do you think it
will it be too difficult

305
00:20:53,041 --> 00:20:55,541
for us to speak with that
person in the meeting?

306
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:58,083
Huh... His name is Rigoro.

307
00:20:58,166 --> 00:21:00,916
If he really is the secretary,
we might not be able to...

308
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:05,041
but... I guess it depends on
what the meeting's about.

309
00:21:05,125 --> 00:21:06,916
I can tell by your expression
you are dying to know

310
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:09,083
the answer to
that little question.

311
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:10,916
You're wrong... I'm not at all.

312
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:13,416
So now... you will
play a pretend game...

313
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:15,333
While acting as
if you do not care,

314
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:17,166
you will tinker
around until it ends.

315
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:21,708
Ah, I cannot escape
the wolf girl's wisdom...

316
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:23,708
If you must know,
I really am curious

317
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,000
about what's
going on in this town...

318
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,541
Not only that but--

319
00:21:27,625 --> 00:21:29,583
You would not mind
making a profit.

320
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:42,791
They gave me
this wooden tablet.

321
00:21:42,875 --> 00:21:45,416
It kinda makes me
suspicious of this place.

322
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,750
Be careful, though.

323
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:52,250
You do not want
to get in too deep.

324
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,000
What ever do you mean?

325
00:21:54,083 --> 00:21:56,666
You never listen.

326
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,500
Before we do anything else,
why don't we tour the town?

327
00:21:59,583 --> 00:22:02,041
All right, my princess?

328
00:22:02,125 --> 00:22:04,041
Yes... I suppose so.

329
00:22:04,125 --> 00:22:07,333
Consider your prince delighted.

330
00:22:07,416 --> 00:22:09,375
What will I do with you?

331
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:12,250
Do you know, I cannot remember
if I have been here before.

332
00:22:12,333 --> 00:22:15,958
Perhaps the town has changed
too much for me to recognize.

333
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:17,708
We should go to the port.

334
00:22:17,791 --> 00:22:19,083
The port?

335
00:22:19,166 --> 00:22:21,750
I heard shipments by
boats are mainstream now.

336
00:22:21,833 --> 00:22:24,000
Which could spell adventure.

337
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:25,541
Oh? Did you say boats?

338
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:27,583
Yep. Boats.

339
00:24:09,375 --> 00:24:11,875
Next Episode: Wolf and an
Enchanting Traveler.
