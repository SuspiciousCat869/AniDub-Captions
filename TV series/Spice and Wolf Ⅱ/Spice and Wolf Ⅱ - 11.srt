1
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:02,250
[ELINGIN] I am here representing
the Derink company.

2
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:04,916
I'm Ruzz Elingin.

3
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:08,333
My name is Craft Lawrence.

4
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:22,500
If my information is correct,

5
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,750
you're from the Lohen
Merchant Guild yes?

6
00:02:24,833 --> 00:02:26,625
Yes.

7
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,916
Lord Goldens from
your guild has ensured

8
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,916
that we have been treated most
favorably since arriving here.

9
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,583
I know the name,
but I'm only a simple merchant.

10
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,666
From the way you
dress and carry yourself

11
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,958
I can tell you're
just being modest.

12
00:02:41,041 --> 00:02:43,458
Especially when accompanied by

13
00:02:43,541 --> 00:02:45,250
such a noble young lady as
your companion over there.

14
00:02:45,333 --> 00:02:47,458
Now I'd like to tell you
the decision we came to

15
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,916
after discussing the
proposal you presented to us.

16
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,500
We can offer you
2,000 Trenni silver coins.

17
00:02:55,583 --> 00:02:56,875
Mr. Boland's representative

18
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,666
suggested a starting
price of 2,500.

19
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:03,333
But we know your intention is
to use it in the fur market

20
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,875
so we felt it was
a tad extravagant

21
00:03:04,958 --> 00:03:08,708
for some independent merchants
trading by themselves.

22
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,708
However we will
wave our handling fee.

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:14,458
The full 2,000
will be yours to use.

24
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:17,375
Of course, that quantity
of silver would be cumbersome.

25
00:03:17,458 --> 00:03:18,583
As such it will be our pleasure

26
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:22,750
to offer you 60 Lumione
gold coins instead.

27
00:03:26,958 --> 00:03:28,958
That is most generous.

28
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,833
Well not really.

29
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:33,125
It's an investment.

30
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,208
It takes great skill for one

31
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,625
to come up with
a manner of profiting

32
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,000
from the confused state
of the market in this city.

33
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,375
I believe that this will be the
first of many triumphs for you.

34
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:44,041
We merely wish to share
with you in your good fortune...

35
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:46,291
It seems that fortune
also shines on you.

36
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,916
In her infinite wisdom
she has chosen

37
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,375
to have you two
meet in this city.

38
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:52,916
Judging by how calm you are

39
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,791
in the face of such
an enormous deal,

40
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,083
I'd say you're a man who
is used to good fortune.

41
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:01,041
And that good sir pleases me.

42
00:04:01,125 --> 00:04:03,291
Every deal takes a certain
amount of luck to succeed.

43
00:04:03,375 --> 00:04:06,750
Those without it do not stay in
the merchant trade for long.

44
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:09,333
So our trust in you
is not frivolous.

45
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,625
That's very kind of you.

46
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,958
And how shall we
transfer the funds?

47
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,916
You're buying
your supply of furs

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,166
from the Arkie company, yes?

49
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:19,958
Your instincts for
trade are remarkable.

50
00:04:20,041 --> 00:04:21,958
I would love to
hear the method

51
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:23,375
you use for picking
your prospects.

52
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,083
I'm afraid my throat's sore.

53
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,833
Talking is rather
uncomfortable right now.

54
00:04:38,208 --> 00:04:40,625
Well, Lawrence?

55
00:04:40,708 --> 00:04:45,541
Let me think.

56
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,166
I'm not sure I could sleep

57
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,416
with such a big pile of
gold staring at me all night.

58
00:04:57,833 --> 00:04:59,000
Large sums of money

59
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,708
tend to inflate people's
sense of importance.

60
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,000
It may even make
them more demanding

61
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:06,916
while continuing to
give off an air of calm.

62
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,541
Truly amazing.

63
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,375
You said that as if you
were being modest,

64
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:12,916
but your eyes were sharp
and told the truth.

65
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,583
And that is quite wonderful.

66
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,000
Would it be agreeable to all

67
00:05:20,083 --> 00:05:21,625
if we had the transfer
of money occur

68
00:05:21,708 --> 00:05:23,916
just prior to your purchase?

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,583
What do you think?

70
00:05:25,666 --> 00:05:29,000
That will work fine.

71
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,583
Let's pray that everything
goes according to plan.

72
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,583
That man is intolerable.

73
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:48,666
I've never dealt with
someone like him before...

74
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:53,166
He makes me feel like a pathetic
little trader in comparison.

75
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,416
Do you really believe that?

76
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:55,708
I do...

77
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:57,458
If there're even a couple
hundred silver coins

78
00:05:57,541 --> 00:05:59,291
on the line, for me
I can't fall asleep,

79
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:01,916
but traders in his
league don't even worry.

80
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,291
That didn't stop you from
holding your own with him.

81
00:06:04,375 --> 00:06:08,250
I'm not used to men of his class
being spoken to like that...

82
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,375
I'm sure he wasn't either...

83
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:12,041
but now he knows
not to underestimate

84
00:06:12,125 --> 00:06:14,125
a simple travelling merchant.

85
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,791
You flatter me too much.

86
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,041
Are you certain
you're not the heir

87
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:19,916
to some rich company
owned by nobles?

88
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,500
Only sometimes in my dreams.

89
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:24,958
You are too much.

90
00:06:25,958 --> 00:06:29,416
So, how did the two
of you first meet?

91
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:32,291
You had to know
I was curious.

92
00:06:32,375 --> 00:06:34,375
I said I wouldn't
ask but too bad.

93
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:37,250
I just can't help it.

94
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,458
People ask me
that all the time.

95
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,708
It wouldn't surprise me if
she came from a noble family

96
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:45,791
that had fallen
on hard times.

97
00:06:45,875 --> 00:06:49,083
Well, I'm pretty sure she
was born in the north...

98
00:06:49,166 --> 00:06:52,083
When we met she'd
been living in a village

99
00:06:52,166 --> 00:06:53,750
of wheat farmers from
the south for some time.

100
00:06:53,833 --> 00:06:56,291
I came through that way
on business awhile back

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:59,000
and I found her hiding
in my cart one night.

102
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,000
She asked if I would help her
return to the north.

103
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:02,708
For some reason I said 'yes'

104
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:06,500
and everything after
has been complicated.

105
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:08,125
Well that sounds like

106
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,416
the sweetest most
adorable story ever.

107
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,000
Don't rub it in.

108
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,541
If you start where

109
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,125
it gets 'complicated'
maybe then I'll listen.

110
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:16,541
I bet that it's something

111
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:17,916
you couldn't even
confess to a priest.

112
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,750
Our troubles would only
scandalize a priest.

113
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:23,125
That must have been
some first meeting,

114
00:07:23,208 --> 00:07:25,583
judging by the clothes
you bought her.

115
00:07:25,666 --> 00:07:28,375
Trust me, she would
have bought them herself.

116
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,625
Not that she really
needs nice clothes

117
00:07:30,708 --> 00:07:32,125
since from the looks
of it she'd do just fine

118
00:07:32,208 --> 00:07:34,500
without any of her
clothes on at all.

119
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,750
Take my advice
and try to keep it down

120
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,791
when you two are at the inn.

121
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:43,958
Even when you pay to
meet with someone

122
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:47,791
there's never any real
guarantee it will be worth it.

123
00:07:47,875 --> 00:07:50,500
Give thanks for
the day you met.

124
00:07:51,875 --> 00:07:54,000
The man who bought me was...

125
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:56,041
the only word that I can
think of is 'pathetic.'

126
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:58,666
Well, now it's your turn.

127
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,291
In the country I'm from the
wool trade is everything.

128
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,500
He thought he could corner
the "wool futures" market

129
00:08:04,583 --> 00:08:06,875
so he dumped everything
he had into it.

130
00:08:06,958 --> 00:08:08,916
Of course, he couldn't have
guessed a royal decree

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,250
would change the policy
and clean him out.

132
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:14,333
Then on the same day that his
bankruptcy was finalized

133
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:17,291
because he had more pride
than any noble I'd met.

134
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,916
He cut his own throat,
killing himself.

135
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,791
Well, at least he died with
a little bit of honor.

136
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,166
I absolutely hated
my wedding day.

137
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:33,208
My grandfather kept
saying it would be

138
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:36,125
the greatest wedding the
Boland family had ever seen.

139
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:37,916
It felt more like my funeral.

140
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,666
But it wasn't all bad.

141
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:43,083
I never had to worry where my
next meal was coming from.

142
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:46,250
And thankfully I didn't
have to bear his children.

143
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,208
With the access I had,
it was easy to skim money

144
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:51,083
from his purse
without anyone noticing.

145
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:54,458
He lost everything
in the bankruptcy.

146
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:55,875
The house, his assets.

147
00:08:55,958 --> 00:08:59,750
But I had plenty of money
saved to start a business

148
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,208
Now there's nothing
that will stop me

149
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:06,541
from becoming more
successful than he ever was.

150
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:08,208
Then everyone will see

151
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:09,916
that he had no right
to buy his equal.

152
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,791
Not for that cheap...

153
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,250
I'm worth more than
a man could possibly

154
00:09:13,333 --> 00:09:15,125
dream of earning in a lifetime.

155
00:09:17,708 --> 00:09:20,750
I'm just being stupid,
forget I said anything.

156
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,250
I like to remind myself
where I came from...

157
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:26,166
That way I can see where to go.

158
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:36,208
Would you believe
I was jealous of you two?

159
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:40,500
That's enough nonsense.

160
00:09:40,583 --> 00:09:43,000
Now, we should only be
worried about making a profit.

161
00:09:43,083 --> 00:09:45,666
Am I right?

162
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,666
I couldn't agree with you more.

163
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,875
Once they've made their choice
about the fur trade public

164
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,541
we'll go into negotiations.

165
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:55,000
Just make sure to let the old
man know where we can find you.

166
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:59,750
Here's to the deal
going our way.

167
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,750
I'll second that.

168
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:09,125
Please do not waste my time
with such dithering ever again.

169
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,458
You sat there quiet as mouse.

170
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,541
There was nothing else
I could do but sit.

171
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,833
Well, I was glad
you were there.

172
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:19,833
It helped me.

173
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:25,250
Are you not going to ask me if
her story was a fabrication?

174
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,416
Not now.

175
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,833
I understand why you feel

176
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,083
the need to make all of
the decisions by yourself.

177
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,416
But that matters
very little to me.

178
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:36,333
It would be wise to rely
on your partner a bit more.

179
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,666
The thought of selling me off

180
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:41,041
is becoming burdensome
to you, is it not?

181
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,750
I can only keep track
one thing at a time.

182
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,333
All it takes is
a little practice

183
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,250
and you can do anything.

184
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,375
You should practice
with me, yes?

185
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,750
Putting my trust in you?

186
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,375
Did you really think
I'd fall for that one?

187
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,333
What is your problem?

188
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,083
Your tricks won't work on me.

189
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:10,333
Maybe, but you will always have
the heart of an innocent child.

190
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:11,833
That's right, but after this

191
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,625
I am going to have
to learn to let go.

192
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,666
We only have a little longer.

193
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,375
There is no denying it.

194
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,083
You are speaking the truth.

195
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:24,916
Yes, a little longer.

196
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:31,625
It is wonderful how time
can bring such changes.

197
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:34,041
Not long ago you
would be trembling

198
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:37,583
if I were leaning
against you like this.

199
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:45,000
You cannot just grab it!

200
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:48,208
Simpleton.

201
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:50,625
Are you not going panic now?

202
00:11:50,708 --> 00:11:53,375
If you ever try saying
what you really think...

203
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,625
then I might start panicking.

204
00:11:55,708 --> 00:11:56,958
You know...

205
00:11:57,041 --> 00:11:58,250
What's that?

206
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:01,208
I hoped that you
would panic some.

207
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:04,500
Of course you would.

208
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:17,041
Our journey should end here.

209
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,041
You think I jest do you not?

210
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:25,125
Of course I do.

211
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:30,833
Well This is far from a joke.

212
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,333
I can't...

213
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,875
I swore I would take
you back to your hometown,

214
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:39,750
that's the promise
I made to you.

215
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:44,666
You have taken me far
enough along the way.

216
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,583
But to end it, why?

217
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,291
What happened?

218
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:50,208
It is like your
little fox said...

219
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,875
"Give thanks for
the day you met."

220
00:12:52,958 --> 00:12:56,583
Very wise
for a human female.

221
00:12:56,666 --> 00:13:01,333
I never want to stop giving
thanks for the day we met.

222
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,625
That is why parting here
is the right thing to do.

223
00:13:05,708 --> 00:13:08,208
I don't ever want to stop
being thankful for you.

224
00:13:08,291 --> 00:13:10,750
But I just can't let
you leave like this.

225
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:13,458
This journey with
you has been a joy.

226
00:13:13,541 --> 00:13:15,125
Laughter and tears...

227
00:13:15,208 --> 00:13:17,875
You have learned to
tolerate my sneaky ways

228
00:13:17,958 --> 00:13:21,666
and even my childish temper
when we have quarreled.

229
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,833
I never imagined I could have
had such a rich experience

230
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:28,791
after having been alone
for so many years.

231
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:33,416
My heart's wish is for us to
continue like this forever.

232
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,000
Then why?

233
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:38,083
I have no fear of watching you
grow old while I remain young.

234
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:40,250
I'll even watch you
on your deathbed.

235
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,500
I am no stranger to death.

236
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,291
But your heart is like
that of an innocent child.

237
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,958
It has always accepted
everything about me...

238
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,500
without hesitation.

239
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:04,125
Because of that,
I am very afraid.

240
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:07,750
You are scared.

241
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,750
I'm scared.

242
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,583
And this is precisely
what I am afraid of.

243
00:14:13,666 --> 00:14:15,458
You have to know

244
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,083
It is so much fun
arguing with you.

245
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:21,208
So much so that
I want to eat you all up.

246
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,875
But if all you ever eat

247
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:25,000
are the delicious things,
then where does it end?

248
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,916
If tomorrow is
better than today ...

249
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,291
and the day after that
surpasses them both ...

250
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:33,208
time flies because you expect
it to be like that forever.

251
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,583
What happens when we reach the
end of that perpetual journey?

252
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:39,291
It will begin with a sense of
dissatisfaction...

253
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:42,416
our playful fights will
become tedious chores,

254
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:46,208
then all we will have left is
the memory of who we once were.

255
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,625
That is why I am scared.

256
00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,916
I do not wish for
the joy we share

257
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,666
to be hastened
forward relentlessly

258
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:56,708
because of your kindness.

259
00:15:01,750 --> 00:15:03,708
There must be some
story you've heard...

260
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,166
one where everybody lived
happily ever after?

261
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,208
It exists not in this world.

262
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:12,583
But you are so close now
to fulfilling your dream.

263
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,666
There is no better time

264
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:17,458
to part than when we
wish for it never to end.

265
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:21,583
You may be right.

266
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:31,083
Did you finish reading it?

267
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:32,416
Yes.

268
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:37,041
It is mostly the same as
the memories I have of it.

269
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,458
Do you think we
should return it

270
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:42,916
before I get drunk and spill
wine all over the pages?

271
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,041
I suppose so.

272
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:47,291
There's also the chance that
you'd fall asleep reading it

273
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,875
and the pages would end up stuck
together with your drool.

274
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:52,208
I never drool when I sleep.

275
00:15:52,291 --> 00:15:54,458
Of course not, just like
you never snore either.

276
00:15:54,541 --> 00:15:56,666
Would you like to know

277
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,625
the things you say
when you are sleeping?

278
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,500
I already know what I say...

279
00:16:00,583 --> 00:16:03,041
Please don't order more
food, I can't afford it.

280
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,791
I have more than earned my bread
on this trip I should think.

281
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:07,750
You can say that now,

282
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,708
but if we hadn't turned
a profit in Kumersun

283
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,750
we'd probably
have starved to death...

284
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,083
or you would have ended up
having to eat my horse.

285
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:18,625
Once you taste poison you might
as well finish the meal.

286
00:16:18,708 --> 00:16:21,625
If it comes to that, you would
make as fine a dish as any.

287
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:24,416
Well... do you know
what you would like to eat

288
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:27,541
once the books are returned?

289
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:29,833
I am going to wait
to choose that.

290
00:16:36,875 --> 00:16:38,916
Be sure to find us
if anything changes.

291
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:43,166
We have to stop by
Rigoro's place for a bit.

292
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:48,958
That inn is going to
become your shop, will it not?

293
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:52,166
Yeah.

294
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,041
I thought you
would be happier...

295
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,375
Is this not a joyous occasion?

296
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,625
You're right... I suppose so.

297
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,500
It seems there are
many people upset

298
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,833
by the decision from
the 50 man meeting.

299
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,541
They're probably
too busy figuring out

300
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,708
how to make
money to be upset.

301
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,250
But you and 'your fox'
partnered up all right.

302
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,458
She's not my partner.

303
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:14,750
With her, it's
strictly temporary.

304
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,875
That is probably for the best.

305
00:17:16,958 --> 00:17:18,541
It seemed like that
wretched store owner

306
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,708
was wary of her as well.

307
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,875
If the money comes as planned
then all will be well.

308
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:27,500
That's the truth.

309
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:29,416
Everything is going perfectly.

310
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,958
I know... that's kinda
what's bothering me.

311
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:35,750
You should not concern
yourself with past failures.

312
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:46,083
Be more careful, I am worth
2,000 silver coins you know.

313
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,416
Of course.

314
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:51,333
I wonder how much wine you
could buy with all that?

315
00:17:51,416 --> 00:17:52,583
Not just wine but all sorts of
the best food there is.

316
00:17:52,666 --> 00:17:55,708
When all this is over,
you can eat your fill.

317
00:17:55,791 --> 00:17:58,333
We should-- no.

318
00:17:58,416 --> 00:18:00,750
I am going to drink so much

319
00:18:00,833 --> 00:18:04,500
that I vomit before
I even start to feel drunk.

320
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,000
But that wouldn't stop you.

321
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:07,708
You'd just drink more
and do it all over again.

322
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,250
Yes I would.

323
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,125
I am terribly sorry...

324
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,375
Rigoro is not here
at the moment.

325
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,541
Did you find something
you wanted to read?

326
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,416
Let's see...

327
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:28,708
Please feel free to take
out anything you like.

328
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:31,541
They may be very valuable
but they're only books.

329
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:32,791
It makes me quite happy
to see someone

330
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,708
get some use out of them.

331
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,291
Just try not to drool on
any of the pages okay?

332
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,583
I do not drool.

333
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,833
I still can't get used to it...

334
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:50,791
Here It is the middle of winter

335
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,833
but I'm staring at
fruit and green leaves.

336
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:54,208
It's wonderful.

337
00:18:54,291 --> 00:18:56,166
Rigoro told me that he can
keep the trees like this

338
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:59,000
all year long if he puts
enough work into it.

339
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,250
Well that was
prideful of him...

340
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:02,833
I am so sorry.

341
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,750
Don't be.

342
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:14,041
Why don't I go and get
you something to drink?

343
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:16,666
Oh you don't have to do that.

344
00:19:36,666 --> 00:19:38,000
It's salty...

345
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
Is there something wrong?

346
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,291
Not at all...

347
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,000
That statue of
Our Holy Mother you have

348
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,625
just looked so peaceful...

349
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,791
I thought I'd stress her
out with my problems.

350
00:19:45,875 --> 00:19:47,291
As you should.

351
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,541
Is Rigoro at a meeting
or something?

352
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:50,666
Yes...

353
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:53,000
They called him away
quite suddenly...

354
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:54,416
I'm sorry.

355
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,791
I wasn't supposed
to mention that.

356
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,041
I'll pretend I didn't hear it.

357
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,375
It's my fault...

358
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,333
I really shouldn't
even have asked you.

359
00:20:02,416 --> 00:20:04,041
Why don't you tell me about

360
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:05,958
the construction of this
glass house?

361
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:07,958
It took over 3 years to build.

362
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:09,916
Each piece had to
be patiently shaped

363
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,708
to fit the design
he had laid out.

364
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,458
Wow... 3 years?

365
00:20:14,541 --> 00:20:16,958
They would call him for work and
he'd always risk being late

366
00:20:17,041 --> 00:20:20,208
because he couldn't tear
himself from his garden.

367
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:21,916
He'd probably rather
just be a gardener,

368
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,666
but isn't being a scribe a

369
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,708
pretty important
job to the church?

370
00:20:25,791 --> 00:20:27,416
God calls us each
to the work that

371
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:29,541
will be most beneficial
to our souls...

372
00:20:29,625 --> 00:20:30,875
on the other hand...

373
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,625
If he chose to give
up being a scribe

374
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:34,958
and stay here tending
his garden all day...

375
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:36,958
which I'm certain
he would love...

376
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:39,291
God would be pleased.

377
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:41,916
I like to imagine
that sometimes.

378
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,916
I think our
humblest dreams can

379
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,583
be the hardest
to make come true.

380
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:49,083
Yes, that seems
to be the case...

381
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,625
Sometimes when
I'm watching him...

382
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,791
It feels as if I could
stay that way forever.

383
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,458
Truly it's when I
feel most at peace.

384
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,541
I'm sorry, is
everything all right?

385
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,208
It's, just what you said...

386
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,958
It was so beautiful.

387
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,833
You embarrass me.

388
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,708
I can't think of
anything more blessed

389
00:21:19,791 --> 00:21:22,583
than to follow a humble
dream all of your life.

390
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,625
It's all I want to do.

391
00:21:31,250 --> 00:21:32,708
Did you destroy any books?

392
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,333
They're fine... and you?

393
00:21:34,416 --> 00:21:35,541
I think I managed.

394
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:38,500
We had a really
good talk actually.

395
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,583
[banging on door]

396
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,166
Who do you think that is?

397
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,708
Yes, may I help you?

398
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:57,708
It's me. Is Lawrence in there?

399
00:22:00,458 --> 00:22:01,750
Eve!

400
00:22:01,833 --> 00:22:03,208
It's bad. We have
to get out of here.

401
00:22:03,291 --> 00:22:05,000
Tell me what's wrong.

402
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,916
The town's rioting.

403
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,000
What do you mean?

404
00:24:09,458 --> 00:24:12,833
Next Episode:
Wolf and Endless Tears.
