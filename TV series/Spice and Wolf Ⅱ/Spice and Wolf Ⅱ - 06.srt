1
00:01:59,208 --> 00:02:01,416
How is Lawrence going
to make it through?

2
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,208
To be honest,
I really don't know...

3
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:05,541
I'm afraid he doesn't have

4
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,416
enough pyrite to
make a difference.

5
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:12,291
We'll just have to pray that
Diana's assistant comes in time.

6
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:14,000
If he sells too little
it could just get

7
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,583
people's hopes up that
there'll be more to buy.

8
00:02:16,666 --> 00:02:20,125
If that happens he could end up
pushing the price even higher,

9
00:02:20,208 --> 00:02:23,958
which is exactly the opposite
of what he's trying to do.

10
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:27,000
Can't Amarty just
act like he's going

11
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:29,708
to make his sale in
order to trick Lawrence?

12
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:31,666
That's what I'd do.

13
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,583
He sure can.
You're a smart one.

14
00:02:43,708 --> 00:02:46,416
Where could Holo be?

15
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:59,083
It is only the foolish
who frustrate at every turn.

16
00:02:59,166 --> 00:03:02,500
Your calmness is a sure
sign of your control Amarty.

17
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,833
Holo.

18
00:03:03,916 --> 00:03:06,750
My love.

19
00:03:06,833 --> 00:03:08,375
Just shut up.

20
00:03:08,458 --> 00:03:10,291
[MARKET CALLER]
We have a buy!

21
00:03:10,375 --> 00:03:12,333
How much is it going to go up?

22
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:21,041
Really? I can't believe
it's gone up that much.

23
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:23,041
Yeah, if it keeps
going like this,

24
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,458
it could move another
20 percent by this afternoon.

25
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,125
I cashed out too early.

26
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,958
I should have held on.

27
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,875
The price keeps
creeping up, doesn't it?

28
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:35,666
Amarty is holding on to
800 silver-worth of pyrite ...

29
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,958
that is, if I remember
correctly, of course...

30
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,958
And 20 percent more?

31
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:41,916
That would be 960 for him.

32
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,416
He'd sell what he's holding
for sure if it got that high.

33
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:48,250
Another 40 would be pretty
easy for him to scare up.

34
00:03:48,333 --> 00:03:50,375
Amarty's contract with Lawrence

35
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,958
would have to
be sealed after that.

36
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:53,625
And all that could happen

37
00:03:53,708 --> 00:03:55,625
before the poisoned
credit can take effect.

38
00:03:55,708 --> 00:03:57,125
The poisoned credit?

39
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,291
Huh...

40
00:03:58,375 --> 00:03:59,291
Still no word.

41
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,458
Where is Diana's assistant?

42
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,833
If Holo's been with
Amarty all this time...

43
00:04:04,916 --> 00:04:08,791
then she could have picked
up quite a lot from him.

44
00:04:08,875 --> 00:04:10,708
Stop it.

45
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:15,833
[MAN A] Here it goes.

46
00:04:15,916 --> 00:04:17,791
[MAN B] I never
thought it'd get this high.

47
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,791
[MAN C] I still
think I can do better.

48
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:22,833
Not good.

49
00:04:22,916 --> 00:04:25,333
It must have been Amarty
who made the deal with Diana.

50
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:26,791
I don't get it.

51
00:04:26,875 --> 00:04:28,458
Doesn't Lawrence get paid

52
00:04:28,541 --> 00:04:30,958
even if he loses to Amarty
in the pyrite market?

53
00:04:31,041 --> 00:04:32,500
That's correct.

54
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:34,208
I thought merchants
liked making money.

55
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:35,791
What's his problem?

56
00:04:35,875 --> 00:04:37,875
Because he would
also suffer a huge loss.

57
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:39,708
And this is the type of thing

58
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:42,125
that can't be bought
back with gold coins.

59
00:04:42,208 --> 00:04:44,333
Pyrite?

60
00:04:44,416 --> 00:04:46,500
I'm assuming
this has to do with

61
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:49,333
getting your hands on
the alchemists stockpile.

62

Please don't
tell me you found

63

the buyer before you
found the iron pyrite.

I've been busy.
I didn't have the time.

Someone else has
already bought some.

Please allow me to
handle the negotiations.

67
00:05:01,833 --> 00:05:04,208
I'm sure I'll know
something by tomorrow

68
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,583
but I'm afraid I don't
know where to look for you.

69

Oh, in front of
the mineral merchant's stand

70
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:12,416
at the marketplace
should be fine.

Holo! Oh, it's you.

I didn't mean to startle you,
but one of our customers

00:06:33,083 --> 00:06:35,458
wants to purchase his
barley using the iron pyrite.

90
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,375
How much of it?

91
00:06:37,458 --> 00:06:40,166
He wants 250 Trenni.

Get back here as
fast as you can.

93
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,666
Right.

94
00:06:47,458 --> 00:06:49,000
[BEARD GUY] It's a sale.

95
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,750
[MOUSTACHE GUY]
I'm holding out.

96
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:54,125
It's got to go up more.

97
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,250
So you know Amarty
bought 500 silver-worth

98
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:08,166
of pyrite from Lawrence,

99
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,083
but he only bought it
on paper-- on credit.

100
00:07:10,166 --> 00:07:13,583
The actual exchange happens
when the market closes tonight.

101
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:15,833
What does that mean to you?

102
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,583
It means that if
the price goes up,

103
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,666
his paper is worth something

104
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,416
but if it drops he'll never
be able to sell it... right?

105
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:34,041
That's exactly right...

106
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,583
Who would want something
that might be worthless?

107
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,541
If the iron pyrite
happens to return

108
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:40,416
to its original value as a rock,

109
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,666
the 500 silver they have on
paper becomes worthless junk.

110
00:07:43,750 --> 00:07:46,375
So then whoever has the
certificate at the end loses.

111
00:07:46,458 --> 00:07:48,458
That's right.

112
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:52,416
And that's why it's dangerous
to deal in poisoned credit.

113
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:04,416
Holo? Where are you?

114
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,666
You better hurry up kid.

Fewer and fewer
buyers on the board.

119
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:24,375

everything I have now.

of pyrite from Diana,

Oh, nothing...
Thank you, Lunt.

129
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,083

162
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:19,208
Oh, sorry, Lunt...
I'm jus-- sorry...

163
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:22,583
This has all been a lot
of work for nothing.

164
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:25,166
Would you take
a message to Marc for me?

165
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:28,833
Tell him it's over,
and that the plan didn't work.

166
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,416
I'm happy though.

167
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:32,583
At least I still get
1,000 silver from Amarty.

168
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,416
That's a huge day's
haul for any merchant.

169
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,041
Well...
Here's your share anyway.

170
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,625
Stop it!

171
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:41,875
It can't be true... You can't
just give up like that!

172
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:44,666
My master taught me that
a real merchant never gives up.

173
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,291
He keeps on fighting.

174
00:11:46,375 --> 00:11:48,750
Fortune and gold
don't favor those

175
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:51,208
who sit around praying for
it to fall from the sky.

176
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,833
They come to those who don't
have any idea when to quit.

177
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,125
I should shut up.

178
00:11:57,208 --> 00:12:00,583
Marc told me you'd beat me
to a pulp if I told you this...

179
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,958
but I just can't hold it in!

180
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:05,416
I fell for her
the first time I saw her.

181
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:10,333
I am madly in love with
your woman friend Holo!

182
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,541
You can hit me now.

183
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,166
You're right...

184
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:19,333
I do feel like
beating someone...

185
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:25,875
Fortunately for you,
it's myself.

186
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,625
I almost forgot...

187
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,625
People who don't
know when to quit

188
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,458
are also the ones who end up

189
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:32,791
achieving their
wildest dreams in life.

190
00:12:32,875 --> 00:12:35,208
And you're looking at someone
who does not quit.

191
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:38,583
Merchants are constantly
making plans, guessing profits,

192
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:41,000
and doing the math
once reality sets in.

193
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:43,291
If I trade in 'this'
I can make 'that' ...

194
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,458
If I sell now, I'll "win."

195
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:48,625
It's important
to think that way.

196
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,000
Honestly, I don't
think there's an end

197
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,083
to the number of outcomes
that you can dream up.

198
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,333
Too much
thinking as a merchant

199
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,875
can drive you crazy, though.

200
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,208
Soon, it starts to look like
every trade has too much risk.

201
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:03,083
The only way not to
get lost in all of it

202
00:13:03,166 --> 00:13:05,291
is to have
something that guides you.

203
00:13:05,375 --> 00:13:08,500
Whatever that is, as a
merchant you have to find it.

204
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,958
And once you do,
and you know its worth...

205
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:14,666
even the craziest ideas
don't seem too risky.

206
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:21,000
You just believe them.
Because they're true.

207
00:13:23,125 --> 00:13:24,958
Once I sell these stones,

208
00:13:25,041 --> 00:13:27,500
it'll be time for you to
spread the rumor I taught you.

209
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:29,291
Okay?

210
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,708
Yes! Right

211
00:13:33,791 --> 00:13:36,500
Tell me, Lunt,
do you still believe in God?

212
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:38,625
Oh, never mind.

213
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,166
[MARKET CALLER]
You're back again, huh?

214
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:51,208
Selling...

215
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:57,708
I am selling too.

216
00:13:57,791 --> 00:13:59,416
You fool.

217
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,916
Hey, don't look at me.

218
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Unlike someone I know,
at least Diana has class.

219
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:29,750
When it was over,

220
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,666
Amarty didn't take
that much of a loss.

221
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,333
I'd say the blow to
his ego was far greater.

222
00:14:34,416 --> 00:14:35,666
[BARTENDER] That's
your payment when you

223
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,500
mess with someone's woman.

224
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,000
That's all you really missed.

225
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,666
I was rather hoping
we would have completely

226
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:42,958
drained him
of all his resources.

227
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:46,250
I can never forgive him
for what he said to me.

228
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,125
I will never tell you.

229
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:50,791
Please don't.

230
00:14:50,875 --> 00:14:51,958
I actually think
it's better that way.

231
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,708
However, that hardly means

232
00:14:53,791 --> 00:14:56,333
this unfortunate
matter is settled between us.

233
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,125
My apologies.

234
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,375
Do you even know the place

235
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,375
where you went
astray with me?

236
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:02,583
Yeah.

237
00:15:02,666 --> 00:15:04,833
Believe me
I know all too well.

238
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,875
Well, sort of...

239
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:11,500
When I saw that contract
between you and Amarty,

240
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:16,000
it was just plain stupid of
me to go it alone, wasn't it?

241
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:18,708
The only real mistake I made
was not believing in you...

242
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,541
I should have realized
you were trying to tell me

243
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,541
you were Diana's other buyer

244
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,041
when I saw those
white feathers in your cloak.

245
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,458
I panicked.

246
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,958
When Amarty went
up to the vendor

247
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:31,291
I became convinced
I was in a trap you'd set.

248
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:35,541
What?! What do you mean?

249
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,000
Nothing...

250
00:15:37,083 --> 00:15:38,791
I thought maybe
you were tricking me

251
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:40,541
into selling
before it was time.

252
00:15:40,625 --> 00:15:42,125
You have to understand,

253
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:44,041
I really believed
you were with Amarty then.

254
00:15:44,125 --> 00:15:46,250
Lucky me...

255
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:49,000
It turns out
I was wrong about that.

256
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,916
You were really trying
to signal me that Amarty

257
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,583
already had enough and
it was time for me to sell.

258
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,416
But I was stuck in my head

259
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,916
and couldn't stop
second-guessing.

260
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,916
And the marriage
certificate...

261
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,666
You actually signed it...

262
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,041
but I thought
about it... a lot.

263
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:05,875
And I figure
that was just to get me

264
00:16:05,958 --> 00:16:08,541
angry enough to
confront you, am I right?

265
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:11,000
Idiot, I was
waiting for you up...

266
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:16,916
Never mind. Go on.

267
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,958
When we were in
Lubinheigen you told me

268
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,625
that things would be easier if
we didn't beat around the bush.

269
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,375
Do you remember?

270
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,291
You said you would rather

271
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:29,125
we just got things out in the
open, even if it meant fighting.

272
00:16:29,208 --> 00:16:31,416
I misjudged you
from the very beginning.

273
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,625
The other night,
when you got upset over Yoitz...

274
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:37,416
the last thing you said was...

275
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,666
I'm sorry.

276
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,583
I really thought
you were through with me.

277
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:46,166
But it wasn't like that.
You were coming to your senses.

278
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:49,250
Right?

279
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:50,875
How can one man
be so clueless?

280
00:16:50,958 --> 00:16:53,083
Honestly, I have seen
clearer thinking

281
00:16:53,166 --> 00:16:54,291
from beasts of the forest

282
00:16:54,375 --> 00:16:55,583
than I have from you
in the past two days.

283
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:56,875
You nearly ruined my plans.

284
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,625
You actually
thought I was plotting

285
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,291
against you for
your destruction?

286
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:01,750
And on top of that
you could not just back off

287
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:06,250
and let me handle it!

288
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:08,000
It is true that we
have only known each other

289
00:17:08,083 --> 00:17:10,666
a short time... but I did
not think the connection

290
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,250
we shared was so
completely ephemeral.

291
00:17:12,333 --> 00:17:16,291
I guess I am
eternally optimistic.

292
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:22,250
Or would you
really cast me off.

293
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:28,333
You're the only travelling
partner I want.

294
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,833
There's only one thing
I've ever been any good at,

295
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:38,666
and that's trading... and
it takes time to change...

296
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:41,583
So whenever it comes to anything
outside the world of a merchant

297
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,166
you would do well to
think of me as a child.

298
00:17:46,041 --> 00:17:49,750
Even still, I do want to
continue travelling with you.

299
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,208
Okay then...

300
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:54,583
Tell me who I am to you, first.

301
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:57,750
It's impossible for me to put
into words.

302
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:58,833
Is that so?

303
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:00,333
Perhaps when your
brain has matured.

304
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:02,458
Believe me, a couple more
weeks like this and I'll be old.

305
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:05,500
Pain makes one wise.

306
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,708
Do you mind if
I ask you a question?

307
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:10,958
It's just...

308
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,250
I was wondering...

309
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:13,541
What exactly did
you say to Diana

310
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:16,791
to convince her
to sell you the pyrite?

311
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:21,791
It was easy enough to
figure out your entire plan

312
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:24,166
from the half
Amarty told me about

313
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:26,458
though I must say
that I was impressed

314
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:28,041
with what you had devised...

315
00:18:28,125 --> 00:18:29,833
You can be quite the merchant

316
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:31,541
when you put your
mind to it Lawrence.

317
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,875
You called her Diana, yes?

318
00:18:33,958 --> 00:18:37,916
My visit had nothing
at all to do with your plan.

319
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,083
So? Why did you go see her?

320
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,083
I sought her help on
a matter very dear to me.

321
00:18:43,166 --> 00:18:45,958
I found her from
the scent on the letter.

322
00:18:46,041 --> 00:18:47,541
Which was no mean feat

323
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:51,291
considering the smells
which surrounded her.

324
00:18:51,375 --> 00:18:53,791
Well, that must
have been fun for you.

325
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:56,458
I asked her to make up
a new story about Yoitz

326
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:59,083
and how it still
existed in the north.

327
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:02,958
I also asked her to help me make
sure it got back to you somehow.

328
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:06,416
But all she did was convince me
to tell her loads of my stories,

329
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,791
which I did,
and then she refused

330
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:10,458
to do what I asked of her.

331
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:12,208
Really?

332
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:15,750
The very moment I concluded

333
00:19:15,833 --> 00:19:17,791
my humiliating tale
of our situation

334
00:19:17,875 --> 00:19:21,500
your boorish hand was
pounding at the front door.

335
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:24,083
Is anyone there?

336
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:27,041
Afterwards, that heinous
woman thought better

337
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,458
of the plan that she
herself had formulated...

338
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:32,125
She concluded that
the best way to divine

339
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:33,916
your true worth was
to test your resolve.

340
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,833
That would explain
what she said when I left...

341
00:19:36,916 --> 00:19:39,333
Do your best.

342
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,291
I was also privileged
to hear that final

343
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:43,458
inane question
you asked of her.

344
00:19:43,541 --> 00:19:46,041
Have you by chance
heard any legends

345
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,166
about pagan gods
mating with humans?

346
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,500
Yes, there are many like that.

347
00:19:50,583 --> 00:19:56,500
Apparently there are all
sorts of scintillating tales

348
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:59,041
of gods and humans mating...

349
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:00,875
If that is your desire...

350
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,000
I could grant it.

351
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:06,041
Will you be gentle to me?

352
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:07,666
But not now...

353
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,416
I have completely
lost my appetite

354
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:13,416
after talking to that woman.

355
00:20:13,500 --> 00:20:17,000
You are aware she is
not human, are you not?

356
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,541
Not a human?

357
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,750
Those feathers you saw that
were scattered about the room?

358
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:24,250
Those were hers.

359
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:28,166
She is actually a giant bird,
much larger than you.

360
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:30,125
She fell in love
with a travelling priest

361
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:33,208
and spent a life with
him building a church.

362
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,541
Eventually the priest
became suspicious of her

363
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,291
since no matter how much
time passed she never aged...

364
00:20:38,375 --> 00:20:41,916
The end of the story is
too sad to tell again.

365
00:20:49,333 --> 00:20:52,375
I want to see
my home again, Lawrence.

366
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:56,708
Even if it is no longer there.

367
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:04,833
What will you do
when we get to Yoitz?

368
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:48,958
Humans are capable
of amazing things.

369
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,000
That we are.

370
00:21:51,083 --> 00:21:53,833
If only you were on
fire for me that way.

371
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:58,250
Well, if I was drunk enough,

372
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,708
I guess I might
be able to get close.

373
00:22:00,791 --> 00:22:03,583
If you get drunk
who will carry me to bed,

374
00:22:03,666 --> 00:22:05,000
did you think of that?

375
00:22:05,083 --> 00:22:06,541
You are an idiot.

376
00:24:08,833 --> 00:24:11,625
