[RIOTERS yelling]

2
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:02,375
[EVE] Everyone revolted
at the same time.

3
00:02:02,458 --> 00:02:05,541
Fur traders,
fur processers... everyone.

4
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,166
[LAWRENCE]
What happened? Why?

5
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:08,625
They made the
mistake of deciding

6
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:10,458
to meet the public too soon.

7
00:02:10,541 --> 00:02:11,875
When they were
putting up a sign

8
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,250
in the middle of town
to make the announcement

9
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,000
a mob of merchants,

10
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:16,916
with their fur tools
in hand as weapons,

11
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,333
rushed them and demanded
for the decision

12
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:21,000
to be withdrawn immediately.

13
00:02:21,083 --> 00:02:22,333
They did?

14
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,041
There's no need to worry...

15
00:02:24,125 --> 00:02:25,791
They may not be happy
with the meeting,

16
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:28,250
but they have no reason to
attack a simple scribe's house.

17
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:30,541
Thank you.

18
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,208
It's too late for them to
change the outcome, isn't it?

19
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:41,416
Yes, it is.

20
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,875
The authority of
the meeting means nothing

21
00:02:42,958 --> 00:02:45,000
if they go back
on their decision now.

22
00:02:45,083 --> 00:02:47,833
Unfortunately, merchants
from outside the city

23
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,958
have already
found their way in.

24
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,750
At this point, they're
resorting to violence

25
00:02:51,833 --> 00:02:53,541
to try and stop the uprising,

26
00:02:53,625 --> 00:02:55,458
but it won't
make a difference.

27
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:56,875
What about our arrangement?

28
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,291
We're fine.

29
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,166
It turns out my sources
were right about the decision.

30
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:02,083
If that outcome gets sanctioned,

31
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,458
we won't have a problem
making the trade.

32
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,541
So what now?

33
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,583
Do we go ahead
and get the furs

34
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:10,916
and just worry
about the cash later?

35
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,791
No; I think that would
give them an easy way out.

36
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:17,333
We can't negotiate if
we don't have the cash with us.

37
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:21,083
You two go ahead and get the
money from the Derink Company.

38
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:23,375
I'll go find a boat for us.

39
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,166
We have to find
a way to operate

40
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,458
around all of these people.

41
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:33,250
It's not like we'll be able
to fight our way out of here.

42
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:35,791
Let's separate and
meet back at the inn.

43
00:03:35,875 --> 00:03:37,291
Unless we're
100 percent ready,

44
00:03:37,375 --> 00:03:39,750
there's no point
in even trying.

45
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:41,166
That makes sense.

46
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,500
Come on we should go.

47
00:03:48,458 --> 00:03:50,458
I can tell you are
concealing something from me.

48
00:03:50,541 --> 00:03:52,416
I assume you have
realized how terribly

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,083
dangerous this plan is...

50
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,791
Am I correct?

51
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:57,333
Yes, you are.

52
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,041
Look... I know
the risks involved,

53
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:01,000
but trust me,
this really is worth it.

54
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:03,791
Good. Then tell me
what you are concealing.

55
00:04:03,875 --> 00:04:05,583
I... can't say.

56
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:07,375
You cannot or will not?

57
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,416
You'll stop me
if I tell you.

58
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,083
Try me.

59
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,375
If the deal goes
through as planned,

60
00:04:16,458 --> 00:04:18,708
and I get to own that
shop I've dreamed of,

61
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,125
I know you'll be happy for me,

62
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,500
but you will
leave all the same.

63
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:24,416
On the other hand,
if something goes wrong,

64
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,875
you won't allow
yourself to be sold.

65
00:04:26,958 --> 00:04:28,333
You would be forced to change

66
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:30,083
into your wolf form
so you could escape,

67
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:32,000
returning home and leaving

68
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:34,250
your failure of
a companion behind.

69
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,250
Basically, the only way
I can keep you in my life

70
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,625
is to ignore this
opportunity all together.

71
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:42,375
And I know... I know
what you'll tell me

72
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:43,958
"Don't throw it all away.

73
00:04:44,041 --> 00:04:46,875
'Tis not worth it to miss
a chance due to fear."

74
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:50,125
That's why
I couldn't tell you.

75
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:52,958
Do you honestly
believe this Lawrence?

76
00:04:53,041 --> 00:04:54,375
Yes.

77
00:04:54,458 --> 00:04:56,750
You think that that
would make me happy?

78
00:04:56,833 --> 00:05:00,708
I do.

79
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:03,625
I will not say you are wrong.

80
00:05:03,708 --> 00:05:07,041
But you are not
entirely correct, either.

81
00:05:07,125 --> 00:05:09,000
If we do this,
there won't be any chance

82
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:12,625
for us to travel together again.

83
00:05:12,708 --> 00:05:17,041
Is that really
what you want, Holo?

84
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,333
When I think of you,

85
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:31,666
I will remember you
as a talented merchant.

86
00:05:31,750 --> 00:05:35,000
Shall we?

87
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,166
'Tis impossible for
there to be a God.

88
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,708
Yeah.

89
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,000
If what they say is true,

90
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,916
and there is
an omnipotent One...

91
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,625
Then why would He
allow for there to be

92
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,375
such incredible
suffering, he created?

93
00:05:58,458 --> 00:06:02,625
I have no idea.

94
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,708
[ELINGIN] And I assume
you've confirmed the total yes?

95
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,625
Yes I have.

96
00:06:13,208 --> 00:06:15,125
You know if you end
up profiting from this,

97
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,708
I expect some wine.

98
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:18,458
Well yes, naturally...

99
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,916
The next time you lay eyes
on me, I'll be a success.

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,541
Of course you will;

101
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,708
no companion of mine
would be anything less.

102
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,666
What am I doing?

103
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:57,958
God, I hope I didn't
make a mistake.

104
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:00,000
What other choice
do I have though?

105
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,666
As a merchant
what else can I do?

106
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:04,250
The amount of money I can make

107
00:07:04,333 --> 00:07:06,250
will afford me
everything I've always wanted.

108
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,125
So why do I feel this way?

109
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,416
Why am I so damn miserable?!

110
00:07:34,791 --> 00:07:36,625
Eve.

111
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:38,958
I got the capital
without any problems...

112
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:40,541
You may count it.

113
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,000
I don't need to.

114
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,833
I trust you, don't I?

115
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,250
We need to hurry.

116
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:47,875
Come on lets go.

117
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,416
I was able to find a boatman

118
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:50,916
who knocked
down his cargo fee

119
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,291
due to all the
commotion over the fur.

120
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,416
The captain told me as long
as we paid him enough,

121
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,250
he'd ship out even if it was

122
00:07:57,333 --> 00:07:59,416
against a full
military blockade.

123
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,875
All we have to do now

124
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,333
is just throw a few
gold coins at him,

125
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:04,166
and he won't be able
to turn us down.

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,916
His eyes would be
glued to that money,

127
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,333
and he'll say yes whether
he likes it or not.

128
00:08:09,416 --> 00:08:11,625
I can almost see it, too.

129
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,291
Then let's go.

130
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:17,583
This deal is so good;
it's ridiculous...

131
00:08:17,666 --> 00:08:19,458
You okay?

132
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,416
The fur we purchase
using this gold...

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,416
We've calculated
a profit margin

134
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:25,750
of 4,000 silver
coins, correct?

135
00:08:25,833 --> 00:08:27,083
That's right.

136
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,208
The boat is waiting for us,

137
00:08:29,291 --> 00:08:30,958
so all we have to do
now is buy the furs?

138
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,291
That's right.

139
00:08:32,375 --> 00:08:33,875
And you know exactly
where to sell them

140
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,333
in order to make
the return we expect?

141
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,083
That's right.

142
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:40,708
I'm getting the impression
that you don't trust me.

143
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,125
I do.

144
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,791
Then what's wrong with you?

145
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,000
Don't tell me you're scared?

146
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:49,041
I think you should
ask yourself that.

147
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:56,041
I already have.

148
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:59,291
Of course I'm afraid.

149
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:03,083
Compared to this kind of money,
killing a person means nothing.

150
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,458
How can I be confident?

151
00:09:04,541 --> 00:09:07,750
I'm risking everything right
now including my life.

152
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,875
And you can't guarantee
I won't change my mind

153
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,333
and attack you either.

154
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:16,250
No...

155
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,791
And you really can't be
sure I won't do the same.

156
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:20,875
I've gotta tell you
I find it comforting to know

157
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:23,333
we're both so
unbelievably paranoid.

158
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,083
It doesn't
really matter though.

159
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:30,291
That bridge is far too
dangerous for us to cross.

160
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:34,500
You look like you're about
to ask me something stupid.

161
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:37,458
Well, you don't have to, I
already know what it is.

162
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:42,625
"Why am I risking so
much just for money?"

163
00:09:42,708 --> 00:09:44,125
Unfortunately for you,

164
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,041
I don't have time for
those kinds of questions.

165
00:09:47,125 --> 00:09:49,416
I honestly didn't want
it to come to this...

166
00:09:49,500 --> 00:09:51,875
But I've come too far.

167
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:55,666
I can't have you running
away at the last second.

168
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,708
You understand.

169
00:09:57,791 --> 00:09:59,625
Compared to 60 gold coins...

170
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,791
killing a person
means nothing, right?

171
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:04,416
See, you do understand...

172
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:07,458
You don't have to actually
experience it, though.

173
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,375
When pride comes,
then comes disgrace.

174
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:19,625
But with humility comes wisdom.

175
00:10:26,041 --> 00:10:29,500
Allowing my cover to be blown
was a mistake on my part.

176
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,166
You may have been right ...

177
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,750
but I'll worry about
being afraid later.

178
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:38,333
You were only pretending
to trade in statues...

179
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:40,125
The truth is...

180
00:10:40,208 --> 00:10:43,041
You were smuggling
rock salt the whole time.

181
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:47,083
And you did it by molding
the salt into those statues.

182
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,541
You even had an arrangement

183
00:10:48,625 --> 00:10:50,541
with the church for
a while, didn't you?

184
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,416
But, it was
too good for them.

185
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,791
People started to wonder how
they were making so much money.

186
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,541
The church couldn't
afford the risk anymore.

187
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,916
Then, tragedy really struck.

188
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:03,166
I don't think I'm wrong
to assume the cancellation

189
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:05,833
of the Northern
Expedition was to blame.

190
00:11:05,916 --> 00:11:07,875
What's your point?

191
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,541
It seems to me the church

192
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:12,625
must have been
desperate for money.

193
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,500
That's why they
got into smuggling

194
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:15,750
and investing
in the first place.

195
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,041
But then, they ended up
growing more powerful.

196
00:11:18,125 --> 00:11:20,958
And you showed up to
offer them even more.

197
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:24,875
You laid out a plan to prey
on the foreign traders

198
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:27,083
who wanted to purchase
fur in this town.

199
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,333
You told them to create
a monopoly and buy it first.

200
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:32,583
What would make you think that?

201
00:11:32,666 --> 00:11:35,666
Your skills as a merchant
are extraordinary.

202
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,416
Although you did tell me

203
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,250
you had connections
within the church...

204
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,833
your plan would have taken
longer to put into action.

205
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,916
Once I knew that...

206
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,958
I assumed there
was another plan...

207
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,583
A plan you must have set into
motion before you met me.

208
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,875
I asked myself,
"who would profit the most

209
00:11:50,958 --> 00:11:53,125
from restricting
fur trade to cash only?"

210
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,000
Let's see...

211
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,625
It would have to be someone

212
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,791
who already has cash
readily available.

213
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:00,875
And I can't think of
a soul with more cash

214
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,416
on hand than the church.

215
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:05,791
On top of that,
you seemed anxious.

216
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:07,333
I think by then
you had realized

217
00:12:07,416 --> 00:12:10,083
the church had
embraced new partners

218
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,083
and was going to shut you
out of your own plan.

219
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,833
They had utterly betrayed you,

220
00:12:15,916 --> 00:12:17,458
joining forces with a company
who was intent on the furs.

221
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,333
When you initially
proposed the deal,

222
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,083
you weren't
exactly lying to me...

223
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:23,166
But you were
conveniently leaving out

224
00:12:23,250 --> 00:12:26,250
a large portion of the truth.

225
00:12:26,333 --> 00:12:29,333
Tell me that I'm wrong.

226
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:34,625
Then I'm sure you figured out

227
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:36,875
why I wanted your
help specifically.

228
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:42,500
Because I could be
a shield to protect you.

229
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:45,583
I am certainly aware of
the sins of the church...

230
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,041
Of course...

231
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:48,625
I was under their guardianship

232
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:51,083
before they
decided to abandon me.

233
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,458
At the time,
they wanted insurance

234
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:56,458
that I would be readily
available to them.

235
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:58,750
I knew you would
feel the same way.

236
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,291
I could offer salvation
and, at the same time,

237
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:05,750
give you the chance to make
money off your original plan.

238
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:07,041
Yeah.

239
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:09,000
It would certainly
undermine the church...

240
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,458
but I couldn't sit there

241
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:12,958
and let an opportunity
just pass me by.

242
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,291
After all, it would be easy

243
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,375
for them to take you
down without question.

244
00:13:16,458 --> 00:13:18,416
But if you had a partner,
it could be bad for them.

245
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:21,583
Taking out a well-known
traveling merchant

246
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:23,708
like me would
be too controversial.

247
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:26,458
So, what will you do now?

248
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,958
You'll see.

249
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:38,250
Are you really that
desperate for money?

250
00:13:38,333 --> 00:13:41,125
And you're not?

251
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:42,541
I am...

252
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,166
No...

253
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:46,333
I can only say I want it.

254
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:47,791
You have to be kidding me.

255
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:54,041
Let's say you killed
me and hid my body.

256
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,500
No one would have
been the wiser...

257
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:56,791
at least not until
the deal was over.

258
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:58,250
And by then, we would
no longer be connected

259
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,750
making it appear
to be random.

260
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:01,666
Or maybe, you had just decided
to take the money and run.

261
00:14:01,750 --> 00:14:05,958
No, that would've been
too cowardly for you...

262
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:08,958
You needed to kill me if
you wanted to use the money

263
00:14:09,041 --> 00:14:10,625
you stuffed into your pouch
when I walked in here.

264
00:14:10,708 --> 00:14:14,333
That was the plan, wasn't it?

265
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:18,666
I assume it's the money you
made from smuggling the salt.

266
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,500
I figure the amount you
were taking from the church

267
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,875
was as much or
more than the amount

268
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,500
I was bringing to the table.

269
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:25,875
Regardless, you
were planning to use

270
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:28,166
all of it to buy out
the fur without involving me.

271
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,041
Then you would continue
to raise the stakes

272
00:14:31,125 --> 00:14:33,083
until the church couldn't help

273
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,958
but do whatever was
necessary to take us out.

274
00:14:36,041 --> 00:14:37,625
You didn't care
about your own life,

275
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,375
much less anyone else's.

276
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,500
The only thing you were
thinking about was money.

277
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:44,500
The love of money
is the root of all evil.

278
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,875
What kind of hell do
you think awaits you?

279
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:48,916
A fiery one.

280
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
What kind of hell awaits me...?

281
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,625
You actually believe in
that stuff, don't you?

282
00:15:03,291 --> 00:15:05,000
I used to watch that
nobleman who bought me...

283
00:15:05,083 --> 00:15:06,833
and I thought to myself...

284
00:15:06,916 --> 00:15:10,708
What is the point of working
so hard just to make money?

285
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:13,541
It doesn't matter how hard
you work or how much you make,

286
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:16,375
you still have to go back
and make more the next day.

287
00:15:16,458 --> 00:15:20,458
It made me think rich
people were pathetic.

288
00:15:24,541 --> 00:15:26,625
Although I imagine right now...

289
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,208
I must look incredibly
pathetic in your eyes.

290
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:31,125
It's easy to sit there
and judge me

291
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:34,000
for following a path
I hated, isn't it?

292
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,291
I watched him
suffer like a fool...

293
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,916
I saw his choice kill him.

294
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:45,750
And still, this is
the life I've chosen...

295
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:47,791
If you really want to know why

296
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:49,833
I don't mind telling you.

297
00:16:11,541 --> 00:16:13,500
Are you all right?

298
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:23,375
Kolka Koos.

299
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,708
I've failed again.

300
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,291
Were you robbed?

301
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:29,916
Not exactly.

302
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,458
Negotiations fall through?

303
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:34,625
Yeah, something like that.

304
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:38,708
Is that yours?

305
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,500
Well man, what is it?

306
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:55,708
Obsession...
Desire... can't be...

307
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,750
Because I still have hope.

308
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:07,375
You're welcome?

309
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:33,375
I told you to leave me!

310
00:17:39,708 --> 00:17:43,791
It... It's you.

311
00:17:43,875 --> 00:17:46,250
Why are you such a idiot?!

312
00:17:46,333 --> 00:17:49,666
Please tell me you did not
go back on the contract!

313
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:53,458
No... I didn't go back on it.

314
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:56,958
I just managed to lose it all.

315
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:58,583
What are you talking about?

316
00:17:58,666 --> 00:17:59,916
That was your dream!

317
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:01,375
It was my dream...

318
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,083
You're right.

319
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:04,083
It still is my dream.

320
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:06,291
I do not understand you.

321
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,208
I suppose I am a bit calm.

322
00:18:08,291 --> 00:18:10,083
Let's just say there were some

323
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:12,083
interesting trade
developments that unexpectedly

324
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,083
left me with a gift
that could buy you back.

325
00:18:15,166 --> 00:18:17,208
The owner has signed
over the inn to me;

326
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:19,250
and this document proves it.

327
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,125
Do you remember
when I told you

328
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,291
what it was
that frightened me?

329
00:18:29,375 --> 00:18:31,291
It's embarrassing,
so I don't want to answer.

330
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:36,333
You know exactly what
I meant and yet you did this!

331
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,750
How will you explain yourself

332
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:40,250
in front of
the wise wolf Holo?!

333
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,416
What do you want?!

334
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,125
Tell me what you want!

335
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:53,000
I want you.

336
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:56,666
I want you to get
into your wolf form.

337
00:18:56,750 --> 00:18:58,000
That is not a problem...

338
00:18:58,083 --> 00:18:59,916
I shall make you into
the prosperous merchant

339
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,416
you have always wanted to be!

340
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,000
This fairy tale
will end happily!

341
00:19:04,083 --> 00:19:07,583
I will make sure of it.

342
00:19:08,458 --> 00:19:10,875
"Please turn into your wolf
form and get it back."

343
00:19:10,958 --> 00:19:12,916
Is that what
you thought I'd say?

344
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:23,416
It turns out Eve is
on a suicidal mission.

345
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:25,208
When the church
catches wind of it,

346
00:19:25,291 --> 00:19:27,041
we'll be in serious danger.

347
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,083
I wanted you to change
into your wolf form,

348
00:19:29,166 --> 00:19:31,041
so you could get us out of here

349
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,791
while the town
is still in chaos.

350
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:34,875
You did...?

351
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,416
Idiot!

352
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:39,291
I love you, Holo.

353
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:49,166
You do not know
anything about anything.

354
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,583
You're right;
I don't know much...

355
00:19:51,666 --> 00:19:54,750
Although, something
does come to mind.

356
00:19:54,833 --> 00:19:57,041
It's possible
my wish won't come true.

357
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,500
But if I never make that wish...

358
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:04,333
Then how expect
to know the truth?

359
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:07,791
Eve is risking
her life for profit.

360
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:11,125
And she knows
where that will lead her,

361
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:13,500
no amount she
attains will be enough.

362
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:18,916
I thought I could be a better
merchant if I had that quality.

363
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,958
So, I was trying
to force it out of me.

364
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:33,875
You are stupid.

365
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,125
Promise me...

366
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,708
That you will be careful?

367
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,291
I know this journey
can't go on forever Holo...

368
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:55,416
...but it's not over yet.

369
00:20:55,500 --> 00:21:00,041
You do realize
how dramatic you are, right?

370
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:02,041
But I thought you liked
your women like this...

371
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,958
I am weak and vulnerable.

372
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:15,666
You do know you have
ruined all of my plans?

373
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:19,250
You must take responsibility
now; I wash my hands of this.

374
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:21,333
Of course.

375
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:22,958
You have defied my foolishness

376
00:21:23,041 --> 00:21:25,125
with every fiber
of your being...

377
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:31,791
Which is why... Why I...

378
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:33,375
Why I shall be more gracious

379
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,000
than you and
go along with yours.

380
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:39,500
However!

381
00:21:39,583 --> 00:21:40,958
I do not wish
to spend my time

382
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:43,208
with a worthless
merchant, so...

383
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,375
Running away with
your tail between your legs

384
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:48,208
simply because you were
robbed is unacceptable.

385
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:53,166
Your kindness
continually terrifies me.

386
00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:00,541
Well? How are we
going to get it back?

387
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,791
I honestly don't
care about the money...

388
00:22:02,875 --> 00:22:05,333
I'm more concerned
with having you back.

389
00:22:05,416 --> 00:22:06,958
Idiot.

390
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,208
Do you think I would
allow you to be betrayed?

391
00:22:09,291 --> 00:22:13,333
This will be troublesome.

392
00:22:13,416 --> 00:22:20,916
That is, if I were
to fall in love with you.

393
00:22:23,291 --> 00:22:25,208
For once I agree.

394
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:28,416
Well then...

395
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,458
Shall we go... princess?

396
00:22:31,541 --> 00:22:32,833
Yes.
