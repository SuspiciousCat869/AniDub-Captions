1
00:02:43,041 --> 00:02:44,208
Let me guess,
you were just dreaming

2
00:02:44,291 --> 00:02:45,833
about something to eat,

3
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,041
and now you're hungry,
aren't you?

4
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,083
I was dreaming of Yoitz...
Of my home.

5
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:59,500
However, you were
not entirely wrong.

6
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,916
Oh?

7
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,583
I am getting hungry.

8
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:14,583
What is the matter?

9
00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:18,291
Will you please put
your tail back under here?

10
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,541
You do realize that my tail

11
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,041
was not designed
to keep you warm.

12
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:24,041
Hey, it isn't my fault that
your tail has such nice fur.

13
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,583
I'd use something
else if I had it,

14
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:29,333
but fine, I guess
I'll just freeze.

15
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,583
Thank you, I think I'll
give you a gift for that.

16
00:03:43,041 --> 00:03:44,708
Be careful once
we get to Kumersun.

17
00:03:44,791 --> 00:03:46,208
It's owned by
the Proanian nobles

18
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,958
but is pretty
much run by heathens.

19
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,291
They have an unspoken rule

20
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,416
that bans the display
of all religious symbols.

21
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,083
It's not a legal
mandate or anything,

22
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,666
but even priests and nuns
treat the ban like it was law.

23
00:03:55,750 --> 00:04:00,083
But that's just the way
they want it, I guess.

24
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:02,333
What, are you mad at me because
I was joking about the present?

25
00:04:02,416 --> 00:04:04,375
My ears could
tell you were lying.

26
00:04:04,458 --> 00:04:10,333
But at the very least I was
expecting some sort of surprise.

27
00:04:10,416 --> 00:04:11,708
What are you doing?!

28
00:04:11,791 --> 00:04:14,041
I am joking now.

29
00:04:14,125 --> 00:04:15,458
Stop it!

30
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,458
I can jest too.

31
00:04:17,541 --> 00:04:19,291
[HOLO yawning]

32
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,666
How are we not there yet?

33
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,166
Please tell me we will
arrive sometime today.

34
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,916
Yeah, we're almost there.

35
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,458
We are almost there?!

36
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,166
Then, the next meal
I eat will not be

37
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,875
terribly bitter
rye wheat bread?

38
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,583
Or the frightening
gruel creation

39
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,291
you insist upon making?

40
00:04:38,375 --> 00:04:39,708
Yes, and on top of that,

41
00:04:39,791 --> 00:04:41,708
they have a huge festival
this time of year.

42
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,500
I promise there will be
a ton of different foods

43
00:04:43,583 --> 00:04:45,333
that you can make
yourself sick off of.

44
00:04:45,416 --> 00:04:48,250
Really... This pleases me.

45
00:04:48,333 --> 00:04:50,291
However, will you
be able to afford it?

46
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:56,916
Yes, I do have enough
money to buy you food.

47
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,708
So please don't worry.

48
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,000
But I do not wish to stay
at a ratty inn because of it.

49
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:05,083
Trust me, we aren't going
to stay anywhere "ratty."

50
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:07,166
As long as you don't insist

51
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:09,125
we each have to have
our own fireplace,

52
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,375
I'm sure we'll be just fine.

53
00:05:11,458 --> 00:05:14,000
I am not as picky
as you imply. No...

54
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,500
I simply wanted to verify

55
00:05:15,583 --> 00:05:17,875
that you were not
using food as an excuse.

56
00:05:17,958 --> 00:05:18,958
Excuse?

57
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,791
"Oh, we do not
have enough money,

58
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:23,375
looks like we shall
have to share a bed."

59
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,583
What are you talking about?!

60
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:30,083
Why would I want
to share the bed

61
00:05:30,166 --> 00:05:32,500
with someone who
snores all the time?

62
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,875
Oh I know I do not snore.

63
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:39,500
Besides, you're
not even my type.

64
00:05:39,583 --> 00:05:41,458
If you don't believe me,
ask your ears,

65
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:46,041
they can tell you if
I'm lying, can't they?

66
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:52,625
So basically...

67
00:05:52,708 --> 00:05:55,208
Basically you prefer me
just the way I am, do you not?

68
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,083
Only foolish men like
their women to be weaklings.

69
00:05:58,166 --> 00:06:00,125
If I were a milky little
princess of a girl

70
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,791
Then you would have to
be my knight and rescue me!

71
00:06:03,875 --> 00:06:08,791
Which is not what
you like to do.

72
00:06:08,875 --> 00:06:10,750
Wait, you did pretend
to be my knight once.

73
00:06:10,833 --> 00:06:11,958
I did?

74
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:13,083
Oh, you disappoint me.

75
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,625
Do you not remember?

76
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:17,208
It was in the sewers during
that awful silver coin debacle.

77
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:19,041
I did not forget.

78
00:06:19,125 --> 00:06:20,916
I remember now.

79
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
It was not just about
physical power, you know.

80
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,666
In that moment, you
became the first person

81
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:32,750
who ever tried to protect me.

82
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,750
Hey, seriously, stop it!

83
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,791
I will stop, if you
will just be nice to me.

84
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,166
Okay, fine.

85
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:49,583
I'm sorry I told you
I'd get you a present.

86
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:51,875
I like you ever so
much better now, Lawrence.

87
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:54,458
Gee, thanks a lot.

88
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:56,416
If there is only one bed,
that will be acceptable.

89
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,875
Although to make up for it
I will require another meal.

90
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,583
Of course you will.

91
00:07:17,166 --> 00:07:18,791
I can smell rather
high quality fish

92
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,666
coming from somewhere
in that crowded area.

93
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:25,750
Can we not buy some of the fish
and have it cooked for us?

94
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,291
You want fish.

95
00:07:27,375 --> 00:07:29,208
Yes, I was just hoping
that you would be able

96
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:30,708
to sell us at least
a few of them.

97
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:32,375
I sincerely apologize,

98
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:35,041
but I'm afraid all of my fish
have already been purchased.

99
00:07:35,125 --> 00:07:36,750
I've had an above average day.

100
00:07:36,833 --> 00:07:38,291
Excuse me for asking,

101
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:40,541
but are you
a travelling merchant?

102
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,041
Yes, I am; I just
came from Lubinheigen.

103
00:07:43,125 --> 00:07:44,666
Well, in that case,
if you follow that path

104
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,708
for about half a day,
you'll reach a lake.

105
00:07:47,791 --> 00:07:49,083
You'll see...

106
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:51,041
The carp there
are exceptional.

107
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:52,583
You should be able
to gather a lot

108
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,625
of fish and sell them
at a reasonable rate.

109
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:56,625
No, thank you though.

110
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,500
We're just looking
for something to eat.

111
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:03,791
I know that look.

112
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:07,416
You're plotting a new
business strategy, right?

113
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,750
No, I'm just a bit
embarrassed...

114
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:11,583
If you're looking for some
fish you can eat right now,

115
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:14,791
does that then mean you'll be
staying in Kumersun tonight?

116
00:08:14,875 --> 00:08:16,333
Yes.

117
00:08:16,416 --> 00:08:17,666
We came for the winter
market and the festival.

118
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:19,208
The Ladra festival
is very popular.

119
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,375
You have booked an inn,
haven't you?

120
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,500
The festival doesn't
start until tomorrow.

121
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,458
Wait. Don't tell me the inns
have filled up already.

122
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,666
Oh, absolutely.

123
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,166
I guess we should go to
the trading guild then.

124
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,000
Oh, you belong
to a trading guild?

125
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,166
I do as well, which one?

126
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:37,833
Oh, well
I'm actually a member

127
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,166
of the Lohen
Merchant's Association.

128
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:40,833
Well, what a small world!

129
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:43,458
I am a member
of the same guild.

130
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:45,000
Wow!

131
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:46,583
I suppose this
is God's doing.

132
00:08:46,666 --> 00:08:48,916
I forgot I'm not supposed
to say things like that here.

133
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,208
Don't worry about it.

134
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,041
I'm actually a believer
from the south.

135
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:55,541
Fermi Amarty, but for business
people call me Amarty.

136
00:08:55,625 --> 00:09:00,375
It's more informal.

137
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,708
And I'm Craft Lawrence,

138
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,041
but if we're being
informal, call me Lawrence.

139
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,291
This is Holo,
she travels with me.

140
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:06,583
We're not married or anything.

141
00:09:06,666 --> 00:09:09,500
We're simply on
a journey together.

142
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:17,916
Why are you staring?

143
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,541
Is there
something on my face?

144
00:09:19,625 --> 00:09:21,583
No, sorry.

145
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:24,291
Are you a nun?

146
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:28,250
Yes, she's on a
pilgrimage... more or less.

147
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:30,833
Well, it seems to me
that God will always find

148
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:33,166
a way of testing
us no matter what.

149
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:36,958
I mean, because finding
2 rooms for you won't be easy.

150
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:39,458
You can find us
a place to say?

151
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,500
If I ask my business
acquaintances for help,

152
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm sure they can
spare at least one room.

153
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,333
Thank you, Amarty.

154
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,708
Of course.

155
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,458
And I'll see if
I can convince one of them

156
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,208
to cook some of that fish
you were looking for, as well.

157
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,750
For someone so young you sure
have a good sense for business.

158
00:09:52,833 --> 00:09:54,500
We'll leave you to it, then.

159
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,541
I'll make the arrangements.

160
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,791
Sorry for making you wait!

161
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,208
The room is perfect.

162
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:19,541
I can't thank you
enough for helping us.

163
00:10:19,625 --> 00:10:21,666
Right!
You're quite welcome.

164
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,958
Do you like it?

165
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,166
He said we did.

166
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,250
And I like it as well;

167
00:10:27,333 --> 00:10:29,500
we are so lucky
to have met you.

168
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:31,208
Yes!

169
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,625
Well, I'm glad too.

170
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:37,333
You're really pretty and seem
to be a wonderful person.

171
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:42,208
Why were you acting
so weird with him?

172
00:10:42,291 --> 00:10:44,333
Because the situation
demanded it of me.

173
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:46,083
This food is amazing,
is it not?

174
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,666
I believe that child
has very good instincts.

175
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:52,416
Especially for his age.

176
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,791
The amount he was dealing
in was well above average.

177
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,666
Especially compared to
what you are hauling around.

178
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,458
What are they?

179
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,708
Oh... Iron nails.

180
00:11:00,791 --> 00:11:02,583
Yes, I know
they are nails.

181
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,166
I meant "what are they"

182
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,625
as in why do you carry
such boring merchandise?

183
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:08,375
Did your failure
in Lubinheigen

184
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,083
take all the fun
out of you?

185
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:11,375
I know it's plain,

186
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:13,000
but we should get
a decent profit from it.

187
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,666
And for your information,
not everything

188
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:17,166
that I'm carrying
on the wagon is boring.

189
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:22,166
That was a compliment.
You're on the wagon, too.

190
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:32,333
Have you already forgotten
you just ordered another?

191
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:34,166
Perhaps, you cannot
handle one more.

192
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,041
You know what?

193
00:11:36,125 --> 00:11:37,416
I'm not the only
one at this table

194
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,041
who could stand
to be a little bit nicer.

195
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,583
If you are nice to a man,

196
00:11:40,666 --> 00:11:42,125
he will more than likely
get carried away.

197
00:11:42,208 --> 00:11:44,041
I cannot allow
you to think I shall

198
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:45,916
fall for the same
flattery over and over.

199
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,625
Of course not.
Why would you?

200
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,291
Shut up.

201
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,500
Men are the ones
who should be kind.

202
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:55,083
And if for any reason
I appear to be upset

203
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:59,583
Then you should
be even kinder to me.

204
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:04,541
I think that this wine
does not look dark enough.

205
00:12:04,625 --> 00:12:08,666
It's supposed to be light.
This is "Burning Wine."

206
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,291
Whoa! Not so fast!

207
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:13,000
See? I told you.

208
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,416
That was wonderful!

209
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:21,125
It reminds me a lot of
the wine we had in Yoitz.

210
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,125
What a nostalgic flavor.

211
00:12:23,208 --> 00:12:24,916
I hope all those
with whom I drank

212
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:27,291
back home
are still doing well.

213
00:12:27,375 --> 00:12:30,166
I cannot wait
until we arrive there!

214
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:38,583
But I want more!

215
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:43,833
Good grief.

216
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:45,625
I think you
should know that

217
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,666
Yoitz has the best
wine in the world.

218
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,416
[BOY LAWRENCE] 
Mother...

219
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:57,083
Whatever happened
to the town of Yoitz?

220
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:20,416
Why am I not surprised?

221
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:22,708
I brought you a bucket
and some water

222
00:13:22,791 --> 00:13:24,666
just in case you need it.

223
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:31,291
And from the looks of it
you're probably going to.

224
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:32,500
Oh, and by the way,

225
00:13:32,583 --> 00:13:34,625
the festival doesn't
start until tomorrow.

226
00:13:34,708 --> 00:13:38,416
Right, well, try and
get a little rest, okay?

227
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:43,541
I'm off to go see an old
business friend of mine,

228
00:13:43,625 --> 00:13:46,375
but I'll be back.

229
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,916
[LAWRENCE]
Marc!

230
00:14:13,291 --> 00:14:14,625
[FOREIGN CUSTOMER]
Merci de votre attention.

231
00:14:14,708 --> 00:14:18,125
Je vais maintenant.

232
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,291
Bien.

233
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,291
[FOREIGN CUSTOMER]
Au revoir.

234
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:24,625
Au revoir.

235
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:27,541
[FOREIGN CUSTOMER]
Merci.

236
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,375
I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to interrupt you.

237
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,666
No. He was going
on and on about

238
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,666
some mountain
from when he was a child.

239
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:36,000
You saved me.

240
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:37,291
I always thought
it would be helpful

241
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:38,750
if I'd learned
other languages.

242
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,750
Yeah, it's been
very helpful for me

243
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,375
and has kept Adele happy.

244
00:14:42,458 --> 00:14:43,916
She enjoys money.

245
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,500
Now, I'm assuming
you came here

246
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:47,000
to do some
business with me,

247
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,375
would I be right about that?

248
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,541
Well yes, of course.

249
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:51,500
I brought you some
nails from Lubinheigen.

250
00:14:51,583 --> 00:14:52,791
Nails?

251
00:14:52,875 --> 00:14:54,958
Why would you bring
those to a wheat shop?

252
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:57,750
Well, you do get a lot
of customers from the north.

253
00:14:57,833 --> 00:14:59,958
It stands to reason they're
going to want a lot of nails.

254
00:15:00,041 --> 00:15:02,458
They'll need them for winter.

255
00:15:02,541 --> 00:15:05,083
Yeah there
might be some demand.

256
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,541
How many?

257
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,666
I've got 123 Pates...
204 Pates... and 205.

258
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:13,000
I also have a letter
of guaranteed quality

259
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,458
from the Lubinheigen
Blacksmith's guild.

260
00:15:15,541 --> 00:15:19,083
Then I'll give you
10 and 1/2 Lumiones for them.

261
00:15:19,166 --> 00:15:21,000
That isn't enough.

262
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:23,791
Haven't you heard about
the crash in battle equipment?

263
00:15:23,875 --> 00:15:26,500
They cancelled the Northern
military expedition this year.

264
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,666
Swords, armor,
you name it...

265
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,958
They're all being sold
for practically nothing.

266
00:15:31,041 --> 00:15:33,791
The market for nails
has fallen too because of it.

267
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:36,458
I think even 10 Lumiones
might be too much.

268
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:38,208
But I thought
that was only true

269
00:15:38,291 --> 00:15:39,791
for the Southern regions.

270
00:15:39,875 --> 00:15:41,958
I agree that material
is more readily available,

271
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:44,500
but being forced to melt
cheap metal into nails

272
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,541
that are necessary
during winter

273
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,125
would drive up
the price of firewood

274
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,666
which would cost
more in the long run.

275
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:51,083
I don't think
anyone would want

276
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:52,500
to anger townsfolk
doing something like that,

277
00:15:52,583 --> 00:15:56,416
so the price of nails
shouldn't really be affected.

278
00:15:58,291 --> 00:16:00,125
Fine... Good grief.

279
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:01,666
Couldn't you have
gone somewhere else

280
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,208
to sell your nails?

281
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,750
If it was wheat, I would
know how to bargain with you,

282
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,000
but I know next to
nothing about nails.

283
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:08,375
Good.

284
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:09,958
How about 16 Lumiones, then?

285
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,125
Too much...
Best I can do is 13.

286
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:12,458
15.

287
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:18,500
How about 14 and 3/4.

288
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,208
Okay, you've got a deal.

289
00:16:20,291 --> 00:16:22,291
Excellent! Thanks, friend.

290
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,083
Now, would you
like for that to be

291
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,750
in cash or is credit okay?

292
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,125
Credit.

293
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:29,708
Thanks again.

294
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:31,333
Almost everyone's asking
for cash this time of year.

295
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,083
Just makes things
that much more complicated.

296
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:34,250
Hey Lunt!

297
00:16:34,333 --> 00:16:35,791
I'm here!

298
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,083
What do you need, Marc?

299
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:38,458
Wait, when did you
get an apprentice?

300
00:16:38,541 --> 00:16:40,458
I needed some help
once I opened the store.

301
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
I want you
to go and load

302
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:43,375
all those boxes
onto my cart, okay?

303
00:16:43,458 --> 00:16:45,541
I'll be selling them
over at Hans' later on.

304
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,000
What?

305
00:16:47,083 --> 00:16:48,583
Wait, I don't understand,
isn't that guy an ironsmith?

306
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,791
Just move the boxes.

307
00:16:50,875 --> 00:16:52,791
Right!

308
00:16:52,875 --> 00:16:54,541
I'm sure you're
planning to stay

309
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,500
through the end
of the festival.

310
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,333
So, you better come
over for at least one drink.

311
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,541
I'd love to finally
introduce you to Adele.

312
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,875
That sounds fine.

313
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,500
Hey, what's the matter?

314
00:17:04,583 --> 00:17:06,500
My store must
be overwhelming you.

315
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:10,083
Yeah it is nice.

316
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,583
Don't lie to me.

317
00:17:11,666 --> 00:17:14,291
You young guys are way ahead
of where I was at your age.

318
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,083
I wouldn't be surprised
if you were close

319
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,875
to opening up a much
bigger store than this.

320
00:17:21,833 --> 00:17:23,625
Cheers!

321
00:17:26,291 --> 00:17:29,666
So the festival
starts tomorrow,

322
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:32,000
which means that we
have to celebrate tonight!

323
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:34,333
You will use any excuse
to get drunk, won't you?

324
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:35,708
You know,

325
00:17:35,791 --> 00:17:37,833
I am quite glad to
have met you Lawrence.

326
00:17:37,916 --> 00:17:40,166
If it had been anyone else

327
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:41,625
with fewer brains
who was more serious,

328
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,833
they never would
have put up with me!

329
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,500
Thank you?

330
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,500
It almost feels as though

331
00:17:47,583 --> 00:17:51,875
you and I met
a very long time ago?

332
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,041
It does, does it not?

333
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,250
It sure does.

334
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,458
Back then, you were
terribly embarrassed

335
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,041
by my many temptations.

336
00:17:58,125 --> 00:17:59,541
It was rather adorable.

337
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,833
Well, back then
you only drank

338
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,500
about as half as much
as you do now.

339
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,208
And you would not have spoken
to me in such a manner.

340
00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:08,958
Yes, it is bizarre.

341
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:12,583
Bizarre is a good word for it.

342
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,833
Normally, it is much
more enjoyable for me

343
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:17,333
to travel and move
around in my wolf form.

344
00:18:17,416 --> 00:18:20,125
'Tis easier to chew meat,
as well.

345
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,583
See.

346
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:23,666
I am not yet
used to these cheeks.

347
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:26,041
These are tiny things.

348
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:31,708
However, I believe
I shall be able to find a way

349
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:34,833
to dwell inside this
form a while longer.

350
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,750
When you're in that
form you get drunk faster.

351
00:18:37,833 --> 00:18:42,333
You are an ass.
You are an ass.

352
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:43,708
Where?

353
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:50,333
He is there.
There is the ass!

354
00:18:50,416 --> 00:18:51,750
You should
have more to drink.

355
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,083
You are forgiven.

356
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,541
Holo, before you pass out,

357
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:57,541
there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

358
00:18:57,625 --> 00:18:59,083
Ask it, then.

359
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:00,875
I was wondering
if you had any clues

360
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:03,041
that could help
us find where Yoitz is.

361
00:19:03,125 --> 00:19:04,833
In the north... Why?

362
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,375
Yes, I know that.

363
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:08,458
But we need a more specific
direction at this point.

364
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:10,041
And depending
on where it is,

365
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,625
we may have to find
a creative way to get there.

366
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:14,791
I don't know.

367
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:15,875
I was hoping
you could at least

368
00:19:15,958 --> 00:19:18,916
remember the name
of a town nearby.

369
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,208
Oh yes! Nyohila!

370
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,541
Nyohila?

371
00:19:30,625 --> 00:19:32,041
Have you heard of it?

372
00:19:32,125 --> 00:19:34,250
Oh, sure. It's world-famous
for its hot springs.

373
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,291
They have a lot
of heathens there, too.

374
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:37,625
But I've heard
they've also got

375
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:40,125
several archbishops
and even some royalty.

376
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,458
Royalty?
How very exciting!

377
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,458
We used to go to those
hot springs all the time.

378
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,583
They healed our injuries
quite wonderfully.

379
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,750
Okay, so if this
direction was North...

380
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,208
and Nyohila was here...

381
00:19:51,291 --> 00:19:53,833
Where would Yoitz be?

382
00:19:53,916 --> 00:19:56,166
That way!

383
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,250
Southwest?

384
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,333
Do you know how far?

385
00:20:00,416 --> 00:20:02,083
It would take me two days.

386
00:20:02,166 --> 00:20:03,333
Less!

387
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:04,750
For humans?

388
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:07,250
Not sure.

389
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:09,333
Two days.

390
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:13,250
I can't imagine how far 2 days
at that speed would be.

391
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,708
It could take
me over a month.

392
00:20:14,791 --> 00:20:16,208
Do not worry yourself.

393
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,875
I shall be fine as long as
I have good food and drink.

394
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:28,000
There's just so much land.

395
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:31,000
And we can't assume you took
the roads in your wolf form.

396
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:33,416
We're looking at the possibility
of it taking a year.

397
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,375
Maybe even two.

398
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,875
What delicious wine...

399
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,666
Are you not having any?

400
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:42,000
If we got to Nyohila,

401
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,041
could you go the rest
of the way yourself?

402
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,083
Of course...

403
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:52,000
I suppose I could do that...

404
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,333
I am sure I would be able

405
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:56,708
to find my way
from Nyohila alone.

406
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,041
Loneliness is
a fatal disease.

407
00:21:00,125 --> 00:21:01,125
No!

408
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:02,458
I was just curious
there's no reason

409
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,166
for you to go all alone.

410
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:06,833
I should be fine.

411
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,375
You only have to take
me as far as Nyohila...

412
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:13,208
Then I can stop as much as
I want if only to look around.

413
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,333
You misunderstood me,

414
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,083
I want to go
the rest of the way.

415
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:19,125
I... I was just
thinking out loud.

416
00:21:19,208 --> 00:21:23,000
Remember when I spoke
of men being kind to women?

417
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:27,625
Men should be measured
by their kindness, however...

418
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:29,625
I am not your charity.

419
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,541
And I have a tendency
to consider

420
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,541
things only from
my perspective.

421
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,166
A blink of the eye

422
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,666
in my world is
a lifetime in yours.

423
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:39,375
A year or two
is understandably

424
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,875
precious to you.

425
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,625
I forgot...

426
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:46,708
I do not wish
to waste your time.

427
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:48,916
I understand your point.

428
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,458
But I didn't mean--

429
00:21:51,541 --> 00:21:54,875
When you make faces like that,
it makes me feel sad.

430
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:57,833
Sorry.

431
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,666
I did not consider
the obvious consequences.

432
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:03,708
I enjoyed travelling
with you too much.

433
00:22:03,791 --> 00:22:05,625
Now...

434
00:22:05,708 --> 00:22:07,666
I depend on you.

435
00:22:09,916 --> 00:22:12,708
I believe I am drunk.

436
00:22:12,791 --> 00:22:14,541
I shall put myself to bed

437
00:22:14,625 --> 00:22:17,000
before I say anything
else I might regret.

438
00:24:10,541 --> 00:24:12,625

the Calm Before the Storm.
