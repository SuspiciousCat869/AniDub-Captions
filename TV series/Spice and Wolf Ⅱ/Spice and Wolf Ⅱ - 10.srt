1
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,750
[HOLO] Lawrence...

2
00:02:01,833 --> 00:02:06,333
Lawrence... Lawrence...

3
00:02:06,416 --> 00:02:10,291
Lawrence...

4
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:14,041
Lawrence!

5
00:02:15,208 --> 00:02:17,250
Wash with this.

6
00:02:17,333 --> 00:02:20,916
Sorry... what's this...?

7
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,583
It is a wise choice
to have my scent on you.

8
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,833
You are beginning
to concern me.

9
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:37,000
She wants me to help her
with an ambitious plan.

10
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,708
You mean that fox?

11
00:02:38,791 --> 00:02:41,041
Her name is Eve.

12
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,333
And she's working with

13
00:02:42,416 --> 00:02:44,833
the landlord of this
establishment, Aroldo.

14
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:46,708
I still have to check it out...

15
00:02:46,791 --> 00:02:48,875
And 'no' I haven't
agreed to it...

16
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:50,125
Not yet...

17
00:02:50,208 --> 00:02:51,666
Is that so?

18
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:52,958
It could be worth...

19
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:56,041
...enough to alienate me?

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,041
And more...

21
00:03:01,125 --> 00:03:03,083
The 50 man meeting
has decided to allow

22
00:03:03,166 --> 00:03:04,791
foreign merchants
to purchase furs

23
00:03:04,875 --> 00:03:06,875
with one conspicuous condition.

24
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,875
Who said this?

25
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:10,708
The church did.

26
00:03:10,791 --> 00:03:12,250
Even though they
kicked you out?

27
00:03:12,333 --> 00:03:14,166
Just because things ended badly

28
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:17,083
doesn't mean I can't keep
my contacts on the inside.

29
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,125
So what are the conditions?

30
00:03:19,208 --> 00:03:21,875
If the foreign merchants
wish to purchase fur,

31
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,458
they'll only be allowed
to buy with cash.

32
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,916
They know that nobody
brings that much cash

33
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,958
with them when
travelling from so far.

34
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:30,750
Exactly.

35
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:32,791
So if some enterprising
merchant can find a way

36
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:36,041
to come up with enough cash
to buy a huge load of furs

37
00:03:36,125 --> 00:03:39,083
all he'd have to do is sail
them down the Rohm River

38
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:43,375
before anyone else gets there
and the market would be his.

39
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,791
You could sell it
for triple your cost.

40
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:48,708
So the profit is
twice the capital?

41
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:53,125
I see...

42
00:03:53,208 --> 00:03:55,291
You didn't even
know there was a man

43
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:58,208
named Rigaro until
I mentioned him, did you?

44
00:03:58,291 --> 00:04:01,291
Do you have any way of
getting that kind of money?

45
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:02,625
Not here, but back
in another town.

46
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:04,416
If I travel there
I'm certain I can get it.

47
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:07,583
I'm afraid time is not one
of our luxuries right now.

48
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,416
The fur in this town
would be bought up

49
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,041
long before you got back.

50
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:12,791
But nobody'll be able
to buy...

51
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,541
I thought that was the
purpose of the meeting.

52
00:04:14,625 --> 00:04:17,291
Initially, it was.

53
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,291
But only to set up the complete
collapse of the fur trade.

54
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:21,458
There are wealthy people in town

55
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,916
who are eager to
buy up the stock.

56
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,333
One last trade to
finance their exodus.

57
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,750
That's why I want as much up
front capital as possible.

58
00:04:31,833 --> 00:04:34,708
Expect trade to go
down very quickly...

59
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:37,291
This is going to be a
brawl between merchants.

60
00:04:37,375 --> 00:04:39,791
An all-out trade war.

61
00:04:39,875 --> 00:04:41,791
You're serious.

62
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,833
The people behind this have
been preparing for some time.

63
00:04:44,916 --> 00:04:46,166
Naturally.

64
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:48,458
That's why your companion
is our only option.

65
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:50,375
We need collateral...

66
00:04:50,458 --> 00:04:54,000
and all we have to do is
claim she is a noble.

67
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,041
You don't think we can do it?

68
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,625
Watch and learn.

69
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:04,083
My name is Fleur Fon
Eaterzentel Bolan.

70
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:07,750
I am eleventh in succession to
the head of the Bolan Household

71
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:10,750
whose fealty is owed to
the King of Winfiel.

72
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:14,083
My family is truly
born of noble blood.

73
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:14,958
Of course, that couldn't keep us

74
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:17,333
from hard times and poverty...

75
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:20,750
but the name is
impressive, isn't it?

76
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,916
Our family became
so desperately in debt

77
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,500
that their only choice

78
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,750
was to sell me off to
an upper class merchant.

79
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:31,208
I maintain my name...

80
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:34,250
and that means I have the right
to sell off a daughter of my own

81
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,166
if I should ever
choose to do so.

82
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:40,833
Smart, yes...?

83
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,958
With your companion's
looks and demeanor,

84
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:45,458
no one would question
her noble roots...

85
00:05:45,541 --> 00:05:48,125
of that I can assure you.

86
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:49,458
Of course...

87
00:05:49,541 --> 00:05:51,541
I know you would never
actually want to sell her,

88
00:05:51,625 --> 00:05:54,125
but I do know a trading company
that will lend us the funds

89
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,791
so long as they get a
share in the profits.

90
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,875
They will expect there to be

91
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,458
sufficient collateral
to cover the loan...

92
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,666
but we'll only use her as the
security to back the venture...

93
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:06,375
A noble's daughter should be
worth more than enough...

94
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:11,625
As long as I give my word
as the head of the family.

95
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:15,416
It's not like I'm asking you to
actually sell your companion

96
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,083
in order for us to
pull this deal off.

97
00:06:18,166 --> 00:06:23,000
This will be my last chance to
go on a pilgrimage, I suppose.

98
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:26,958
I have had plenty of chances
to go in the past...

99
00:06:27,041 --> 00:06:31,333
but I always let them slip by.

100
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:34,708
I can offer you my inn as well.

101
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,833
In truth this is exactly

102
00:06:35,916 --> 00:06:38,458
what you have always
wanted, is it not?

103
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:40,041
You're right.

104
00:06:40,125 --> 00:06:41,875
Then why are you hesitating?

105
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:43,500
For as long as I have known you,

106
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,541
it has been your dream
to own your own shop.

107
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,833
What right do I have to
place myself before that?

108
00:06:48,916 --> 00:06:50,458
I can't ask you to do this.

109
00:06:50,541 --> 00:06:52,041
You fool.

110
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:57,375
How so?

111
00:06:57,458 --> 00:07:00,625
As I recall, you didn't even
want me to trade in this town.

112
00:07:00,708 --> 00:07:05,375
Oh Lawrence...

113
00:07:05,458 --> 00:07:08,250
I am loath to admit
this to you, but-

114
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,750
'Tis true...

115
00:07:11,833 --> 00:07:15,125
I am always most at peace when
I am traveling by your side.

116
00:07:15,208 --> 00:07:17,250
Being your partner
on this journey

117
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:18,958
has been my greatest reward.

118
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,708
I always gain more from
you than I ever give.

119
00:07:22,791 --> 00:07:26,833
And if I lost that...
my heart would break.

120
00:07:26,916 --> 00:07:29,541
It is your business to
examine profit and risk,

121
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,458
make the choice you think is
going to be best in the end.

122
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:34,333
When a deal shows promise,

123
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:36,458
I never see you hesitate for
some other reason.

124
00:07:36,541 --> 00:07:38,250
Even if you think
your new associate

125
00:07:38,333 --> 00:07:39,791
is trying to deceive you,

126
00:07:39,875 --> 00:07:42,208
you are always a step ahead of
them and profit nonetheless.

127
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,083
You are a man who makes trades
without fear or apprehension.

128
00:07:45,166 --> 00:07:47,958
What happened to your courage?

129
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,833
What is this sudden need
for caution?

130
00:07:50,916 --> 00:07:55,500
I have been nothing but
selfish up till now.

131
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:59,541
I believe it is your
turn to be selfish.

132
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,333
Even so that still that doesn't
give me the right to pawn you.

133
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:05,666
Is this business
deal the reason you

134
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,875
were crying out in your sleep?

135
00:08:07,958 --> 00:08:09,750
Won't you get mad?

136
00:08:09,833 --> 00:08:12,958
I would only be mad because you
would think me so shallow.

137
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,000
Are you saying you
do not understand?

138
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:19,750
Yes,

139
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,541
You creatures never
cease to baffle me.

140
00:08:21,625 --> 00:08:23,458
Am I your equal
partner or am I not?

141
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:27,791
Perhaps I am just a little
girl who amuses you?

142
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:30,250
This would not be the first
time

143
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:32,416
I offered myself as
a sacrifice for you.

144
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,291
Before it was in gratitude.

145
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,791
But the circumstances
have changed greatly.

146
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,291
Holo...

147
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:42,708
Now, is there any other way
to put your mind at ease?

148
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:45,958
You could help me figure out if
this is really a double cross.

149
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:48,458
As if a double cross
would matter to you...

150
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,333
just plan ahead for it...

151
00:08:50,416 --> 00:08:53,333
"The more intricate the plot
ends up being."

152
00:08:53,416 --> 00:08:57,000
Then the bigger the score
is when you uncover it...

153
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,791
You actually listen to me...

154
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:00,333
I'm surprised.

155
00:09:00,416 --> 00:09:02,500
Well, I am still
Holo the Wise Wolf.

156
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:06,208
I could not have some
dullard merchant

157
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:09,625
for a partner, now could I?

158
00:09:09,708 --> 00:09:11,666
Shall we go?

159
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,708
Sure. How 'bout breakfast?

160
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:26,041
It looks more like
a fort than a church.

161
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:38,125
I pray God keep you safe today.

162
00:09:38,208 --> 00:09:42,125
[BEGGAR] You're a little
scruffy for a nun.

163
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:45,958
No, I'm definitely
not with the church.

164
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,125
I just have something
I'd like to ask you

165
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:54,916
So... ask me your question.

166
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,333
It has to do
with the church.

167
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,291
Guys like you used to be
everywhere back in the day.

168
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,625
You want their
business connections.

169
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,916
You sure are a perceptive man.

170
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,333
This is the biggest
church around for miles.

171
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,375
They pride themselves
on their charity.

172
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:14,000
Beans, bread... anything
for the poor... it's just...

173
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:18,541
Just what?

174
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,500
The Bishop hasn't
limited himself

175
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,875
to just passing out food;
he also deals in money.

176
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,208
And how do you know this?

177
00:10:25,291 --> 00:10:26,791
Why wouldn't I know?

178
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:30,083
All the fancy carriages that get
lined up here week after week.

179
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:32,291
All those finely
dressed people

180
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,916
from the city
climbing out of them.

181
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,375
The stuff they
throw out from dinner

182
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:38,625
tells me it's not just beans
and bread they're getting.

183
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,750
I know.

184
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,458
Couldn't you leverage
that information

185
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:45,125
to climb up out of
where you are now?

186
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,500
Haven't you ever heard it

187
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:49,000
said "Blessed are the
poor in spirit."

188
00:10:49,083 --> 00:10:51,000
I'll bet you have no idea
what it's like to rejoice

189
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:52,833
over brown bread
and two bronze coins

190
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:57,250
the way I do,
and you never will.

191
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:01,500
I rejoice like that daily.

192
00:11:01,583 --> 00:11:03,916
I don't know what it is
you think you're doing...

193
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,916
but their good graces will
leave you robbed blind.

194
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,833
That's a bit of wisdom I can
give you from experience.

195
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,750
There's only one
person I've ever seen

196
00:11:11,833 --> 00:11:13,041
who was able to stay
in their graces

197
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,583
for an extended
period of time.

198
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,875
And even that ended with him
screaming himself hoarse

199
00:11:16,958 --> 00:11:19,541
at the front of their gate.

200
00:11:19,625 --> 00:11:21,833
Was it a man trading
stone statues?

201
00:11:21,916 --> 00:11:23,291
Statues?

202
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:25,791
Yeah, I think he dealt in
those among other stuff...

203
00:11:25,875 --> 00:11:27,833
So was this a friend of yours?

204
00:11:27,916 --> 00:11:29,750
In a manner of speaking.

205
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,791
I always assumed that his
primary trade was in salt.

206
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,166
In salt?

207
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,291
What is it makes you say that?

208
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:39,250
Sometimes I used
to see salt spill

209
00:11:39,333 --> 00:11:41,500
from the loads he was
bringing up to the church.

210
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:42,875
I can tell the quality of
the salt from the smell,

211
00:11:42,958 --> 00:11:48,250
and this stuff
was not high grade.

212
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:51,916
The farther from the
sea a merchant travels...

213
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,333
the more valuable any
salt traded becomes.

214
00:11:54,416 --> 00:11:58,583
Interesting...
a salt merchant?

215
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,208
[HELENA] Coming to see
me early again, huh?

216
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,041
You're not the
only smart one...

217
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:07,625
Plenty of other merchants
come to see me too.

218
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:10,500
I'd say most just want to get a
look at those beautiful eyes.

219
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:11,916
People think a few bronze
coins give them the right

220
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:15,125
to lose all their manners.

221
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:18,000
I'm afraid that I've come
to be impolite as well.

222
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,458
You don't think I know that?

223
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:22,625
Well, go ahead and ask...

224
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:23,958
About the 50 man meeting.

225
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,875
I guess they've
wrapped it up already.

226
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,916
Everyone's saying
they're going

227
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,333
to make it okay to
sell furs for now.

228
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,166
But they won't let any foreign
merchants buy on credit.

229
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,583
Foreign merchants can
only buy fur with cash.

230
00:12:34,666 --> 00:12:36,666
Like she said.

231
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,791
Oh... Nothing...

232
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:41,541
I also wanted to ask you about
the church in this town.

233
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:48,041
Okay.

234
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:53,083
I won't speak ill of them...

235
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:55,291
but you shouldn't get
involved with the church.

236
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:58,416
So they really are in the
middle of some power struggle.

237
00:12:58,500 --> 00:13:00,958
I don't know the details
of what's going on...

238
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:02,958
but I know powerful people

239
00:13:03,041 --> 00:13:04,625
keep coming to dinners
at the Chancery.

240
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,000
They hired me on for two
full days and nights,

241
00:13:07,083 --> 00:13:08,958
and I found out
it was because

242
00:13:09,041 --> 00:13:11,458
they were hosting some important
visitor from the church.

243
00:13:11,541 --> 00:13:14,583
It looks like they're gathering
their strength about them.

244
00:13:14,666 --> 00:13:15,958
And they seem very concerned

245
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:17,500
about their standing
with the people.

246
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:20,166
They've become really generous
with their charity...

247
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:21,625
but if you wonder aloud

248
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,333
where all the money is
coming from to fund it...

249
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:24,458
Well, I'm not sure
what would happen,

250
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:26,541
but I can't imagine
it would end well.

251
00:13:26,625 --> 00:13:31,000
Once the church has
turned their eye on you,

252
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,791
being forced out of town
won't be far behind.

253
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,541
At least that's what
everyone thinks.

254
00:13:36,125 --> 00:13:39,166
You're taking a big risk
telling me all this.

255
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,291
I like talking to you,
that's all...

256
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:44,083
It makes me feel
like I'm special.

257
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:45,750
I don't understand...

258
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:48,416
What about that would
make you feel special?

259
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:50,625
If I narrowed it
down to one thing...

260
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:54,916
It would have to be that other
woman I can smell all over you.

261
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Be honest.

262
00:13:56,083 --> 00:13:57,166
I'm not the first girl
with half a mind

263
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:59,625
who's tried to flirt
with you like this.

264
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,166
But I'm the prettiest.

265
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,541
I hate to say it, but
this has never happened.

266
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:07,750
What that tells me is that
you and your girlfriend

267
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:09,625
haven't been
together for long...

268
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:12,000
no, not very long at all.

269
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:14,958
I can tell by your eyes
that you're very kind.

270
00:14:15,041 --> 00:14:17,416
When you travelled
around by yourself...

271
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:20,291
I'm sure women hardly took
any notice of you at all...

272
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:22,791
But put a beautiful
girl by your side...

273
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,041
and they just can't
help but wonder

274
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:27,041
what it is they're
missing with you.

275
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:29,791
Stick a sheep out in the middle
of a field all by itself

276
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:32,000
and nobody really
cares to hunt it,

277
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,208
but as soon as another
wolf draws near

278
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:38,125
suddenly everyone else
wants to have it, too.

279
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:39,875
And because I know that

280
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:42,750
I'd like invite the two of
you here so I could meet her.

281
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,416
Why thank you, glad to accept.

282
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,833
I can never tell...

283
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:47,666
Are you serious or not?

284
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,166
And you are certain that is

285
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:52,875
everything that
happened with her?

286
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,833
I don't have anything to hide.

287
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,791
I should give this girl a lesson

288
00:14:56,875 --> 00:15:00,208
in the dangers of crossing
into a wolf's territory.

289
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,250
But I have to say that
I am very impressed

290
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,875
with how well you have
handled the situation.

291
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:06,625
Well, if you want a horse to run
quickly

292
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,000
sometimes it's best just to let
go of the reigns for a while.

293
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:14,291
Alright then, what do your
horse instincts tell you?

294
00:15:14,375 --> 00:15:17,375
The clergy are trying to
have a cathedra installed

295
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,291
in their church so they can
increase its influence.

296
00:15:19,375 --> 00:15:20,625
A cathedra?

297
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,583
It's Latin for 'chair' but
it represents the seat

298
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,125
of a new diocese and

299
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,875
requires that a Bishop be
elevated and seated upon it.

300
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:29,125
Then the church's
influence extends

301
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,041
to all the towns in
its diocese as well.

302
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,333
I can understand why that fox
of yours would be so eager

303
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,125
to leave since
she's no longer

304
00:15:36,208 --> 00:15:37,416
going to be part of the
growing power structure.

305
00:15:37,500 --> 00:15:38,708
I'm still curious as to why

306
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,750
she's no longer in
their good graces.

307
00:15:41,833 --> 00:15:45,125
If I were in her place
I think I'd put up with it.

308
00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:46,708
The power the church wields

309
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:49,416
would make it
worth it in the end.

310
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:52,291
What's your take on it?

311
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:53,708
That almost sounds like

312
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:55,041
you would like to
know what I think.

313
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:57,666
Not really...

314
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:01,625
It just helps me think
to hear someone's voice.

315
00:16:01,708 --> 00:16:03,708
Particularly when I'm faced

316
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,166
with a conundrum
like this one.

317
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,750
You would not change your mind

318
00:16:06,833 --> 00:16:08,458
if I cried and
begged, would you?

319
00:16:08,541 --> 00:16:10,875
I'd have to ignore you.

320
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:13,291
And you'd be waiting
for me at the inn.

321
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,083
We would make up after
I came back successful.

322
00:16:16,166 --> 00:16:19,666
This one isn't up to you.

323
00:16:19,750 --> 00:16:21,083
That will be more convincing...

324
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:23,916
when your face does not redden.

325
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,125
I'll work on it.

326
00:16:27,875 --> 00:16:29,166
You are so energetic today.

327
00:16:29,250 --> 00:16:30,791
Men come into their own when

328
00:16:30,875 --> 00:16:32,375
they are on the heels
of their prey only...

329
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,708
You'd like it more if
you were being hunted.

330
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,750
Perfect marks, however,
have you stopped to consider

331
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:43,208
my fate should your deal
not go exactly as planned?

332
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:44,666
You are acting
as the collateral.

333
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:47,500
If we fail they will sell
you off to satisfy our debt.

334
00:16:47,583 --> 00:16:51,625
And this is why your sleep has
been so troubled as of late.

335
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,958
That's part of it.

336
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,666
If that happens...

337
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,625
I hope they sell me off to
someone who is not quite so dim.

338
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:01,750
Yes, those who cannot repay

339
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:03,333
the money they've
borrowed are idiots.

340
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:06,333
They deserve all
the hardships that come.

341
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,250
Such boldness
from the little boy

342
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:13,041
who desperately begged
me when I was trying to leave.

343
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:24,000
I am helping you because I

344
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,750
believe in you
with all my heart.

345
00:17:25,833 --> 00:17:28,583
Of course you do.

346
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,833
Okay... It's time for us to go.

347
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,250
Really...

348
00:17:41,333 --> 00:17:43,583
You so enjoy letting your nerves
have their way with you.

349
00:17:43,666 --> 00:17:46,083
Well if not in the privacy
of my own room,

350
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,625
when do I ever get to be myself?

351
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:52,375
When we first met,
even up until recently...

352
00:17:52,458 --> 00:17:54,833
it always seemed to me
like you were attempting

353
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,875
to put on some kind
of a show for me.

354
00:17:56,958 --> 00:17:59,750
You know I'd never travelled
with a woman before...

355
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:01,875
You take some getting used to.

356
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,500
In the early days
of our travels,

357
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,416
even the thought of
taking me in public

358
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:09,166
would quicken your breath and
make you nervous.

359
00:18:09,250 --> 00:18:12,000
And if I started keeping the
company of other women now,

360
00:18:12,083 --> 00:18:14,708
would it still make your tail
bristle like before?

361
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,666
Men are onions.

362
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:20,000
Many layers and all
of them make you cry.

363
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:21,708
In the end, you just
end up exclaiming

364
00:18:21,791 --> 00:18:24,208
how it should not have
turned out this way.

365
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,291
But isn't that the
case with whomever

366
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,250
once you allow them
into your heart?

367
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:32,500
You are wasting your bait on a
fish you have already caught.

368
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,833
Now why would you
bother doing that?

369
00:18:34,916 --> 00:18:37,333
I think 'caught' belies the fact
that this 'fish' fought its way

370
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,500
on to my boat despite my
best efforts against it.

371
00:18:40,583 --> 00:18:42,500
It's not bait I
should be giving you

372
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:47,833
but a bill for your
enormous boarding fee.

373
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,625
What's wrong?

374
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:56,583
Remember, you felt much
differently when we first met.

375
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:58,791
Come on, time to go.

376
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:01,750
Um... right.

377
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:08,041
I only dare to hold
your hand like this

378
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,125
because we have been through so
much together on this journey.

379
00:19:11,208 --> 00:19:13,875
It is curious...

380
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,958
Poets sing of changing things
back to how they once were,

381
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,041
but I am not sure
it would suit me.

382
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,916
A woman like you
might actually like it.

383
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,083
But if things
stayed that way for me.

384
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,958
I'd end up collapsed
dead from anxiety.

385
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,083
You worry too much.

386
00:19:28,166 --> 00:19:31,125
You will have me for your nurse
when your end finally comes.

387
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:40,583
So, have you made up your
mind about the plan yet?

388
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,833
I've done my share of
due diligence...

389
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:46,416
and my instincts tell me
what you say is true.

390
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,416
And?

391
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:51,625
However, one thing
still concerns me.

392
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,208
What's that?

393
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:56,000
I don't know the conflict

394
00:19:56,083 --> 00:19:59,458
that caused you to
part with the church.

395
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,916
Well... I guess that's
reasonable enough.

396
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,166
The Chancellor for
the church is in love

397
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,500
with the idea of power.

398
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:06,958
Not only is he
trying to establish

399
00:20:07,041 --> 00:20:08,291
a Cathedra out
of this diocese,

400
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:09,875
but he'd like it to be

401
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,666
the Metropolitan over
the whole region.

402
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:12,791
An Archbishop?

403
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:14,208
Exactly.

404
00:20:14,291 --> 00:20:15,875
While sniffing around for
a lucrative business deal,

405
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,750
I happened upon his network of
backroom money transactions.

406
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,416
He was siphoning off donations
for use in his fur trade

407
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,291
through a shell company

408
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:25,250
he'd established
before he was ordained.

409
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:27,833
But he had gotten himself
into financial trouble.

410
00:20:27,916 --> 00:20:29,625
So, I came along with a way

411
00:20:29,708 --> 00:20:32,041
to kill two birds
with one stone.

412
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:34,041
Your trade in stone statues.

413
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,250
Correct.

414
00:20:35,333 --> 00:20:37,416
But we weren't just selling
stone statues...

415
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:39,000
I'm not just some merchant.

416
00:20:39,083 --> 00:20:41,291
I am Winfiel
nobility after all.

417
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,166
Through my family I
have a connection

418
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,708
with the Cardinal who
oversees political assignments.

419
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,875
So in return for using your
connection with the Cardinal,

420
00:20:47,958 --> 00:20:51,333
the Bishop agreed to
sponsor your statue trade.

421
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,083
You had a captive
market in the church

422
00:20:53,166 --> 00:20:55,208
and all the support
you could ask for.

423
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:57,166
The idea of the bishop
moving up in the ranks

424
00:20:57,250 --> 00:20:59,916
made the low profit
margins easier to cope with.

425
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,916
But as his path to
ascension became more secure

426
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,708
he began to sift the wheat
from the chaff as it were,

427
00:21:04,791 --> 00:21:08,333
cutting me off without
so much as a farewell.

428
00:21:08,416 --> 00:21:09,875
He came to his senses then.

429
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:12,166
He realized you'd be
a costly ally to keep.

430
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,375
I would have troubled him,
to be sure.

431
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:15,916
But no.

432
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,333
Rather than train his own
trader from within his circle...

433
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:20,791
He chose to seek
out an established company

434
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,750
instead and so
I became obsolete.

435
00:21:22,833 --> 00:21:24,833
Just because I
understand why he did

436
00:21:24,916 --> 00:21:26,625
it doesn't mean
I have to like it.

437
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,375
I get it.

438
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:30,291
So your stock of statues

439
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:32,208
had become harder
to sell over night.

440
00:21:32,291 --> 00:21:34,875
And waiting around for
another expedition

441
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:37,541
to the north is just
not an option.

442
00:21:44,125 --> 00:21:45,708
I see it clearly...

443
00:21:45,791 --> 00:21:48,291
Let's set a meeting to discuss
the details of the plan.

444
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:51,625
It'll be my pleasure.

445
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,500
Your fox's hands were
shaking, were they not?

446
00:22:01,583 --> 00:22:05,041
Nerves can get even the best
of merchants, I suppose.

447
00:22:05,125 --> 00:22:08,666
Let us hope that
is all it was...

448
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:14,333
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Let's go.

449
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,916
We should get about
1,500 silver coins for you.

450
00:24:09,583 --> 00:24:12,458

Wolf and the Decision to Part
