1
00:01:58,791 --> 00:01:59,583
[MERCHANT A]
Hey!

2
00:01:59,666 --> 00:02:01,333
Looks who's
headed this way!

3
00:02:01,416 --> 00:02:02,333
[MERCHANT B]
A round of applause

4
00:02:02,416 --> 00:02:03,583
for this brave merchant!

5
00:02:08,916 --> 00:02:11,083
[AMARTY] Let me repeat
my vow for our new arrival!

6
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,125
I shall pay off all debts
owed by the travelling nun,

7
00:02:14,208 --> 00:02:17,083
and when she has been
released from her contract.

8
00:02:17,166 --> 00:02:19,333
In the name
of Saint Francis,

9
00:02:19,416 --> 00:02:22,125
saint of merchants and
this Lohen Merchants Association

10
00:02:22,208 --> 00:02:24,625
I swear I shall
do the following:

11
00:02:24,708 --> 00:02:27,541
I will profess
my undying love!

12
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,583
Holo told me about
her unfortunate debt

13
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:31,791
as well as the way
you've been treating her.

14
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:34,958
I will use my fortune and
social standing to release her

15
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,041
from you and
restore her freedom.

16
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,416
And then I will ask
for her hand in marriage!

17
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,208
[LAWRENCE]
You've sealed it with blood?

18
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:43,250
You can pay off her debts,

19
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:45,125
but that doesn't
necessarily mean

20
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:46,625
she'll choose to stop
travelling with me,

21
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:48,000
you know that, right?

22
00:02:48,083 --> 00:02:49,708
Yes, but I am confident
that she will.

23
00:02:49,791 --> 00:02:51,625
And don't forget,
Holo is still a nun.

24
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:53,583
You cannot marry her.

25
00:02:53,666 --> 00:02:55,250
Yes, so you say,
but she does not

26
00:02:55,333 --> 00:02:57,916
belong to any
convent, does she?

27
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,125
Because she
isn't really a nun.

28
00:03:00,208 --> 00:03:02,541
It's just convenient
to say while travelling.

29
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:04,958
She isn't bound by any
oaths forbidding marriage.

30
00:03:05,041 --> 00:03:07,333
I see you've done
your research.

31
00:03:07,416 --> 00:03:09,125
According to Kumersun city law,

32
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:10,750
when a woman is in debt,

33
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:14,000
her creditor holds all rights
to her, including guardianship.

34
00:03:14,083 --> 00:03:15,791
So, if you were to decide

35
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:18,125
to accept my marriage
proposal on her behalf

36
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,083
we would not have to worry
about this contract at all.

37
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,500
Well, then?

38
00:03:22,583 --> 00:03:25,125
Will you accept
the contractual knife?

39
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,750
[MERCHANT C] Don't let
him scare you off!

40
00:03:26,833 --> 00:03:28,958
[MERCHANT D] Be a man!
Take the knife!

41
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,916
I'd like to read
the contract, may I?

42
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:37,666
1,000 Trenni silver coins?

43
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:40,375
I agree to repay the entire
sum that Holo owes to you

44
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,916
before the end of
business tomorrow.

45
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,041
It appears there's no release
clause for the expiry period.

46
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,625
No.

47
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,500
You will receive all the money
you're owed tomorrow evening.

48
00:03:49,583 --> 00:03:50,958
Cash only...

49
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,375
I won't accept loans
or any kind of bargaining.

50
00:03:53,458 --> 00:03:57,333
Are we in agreement, then?

51
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,291
I accept your terms.

52
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:02,291
Then the contract
is established.

53
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,541
I will see you
tomorrow, Lawrence.

54
00:04:08,833 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't get ahead of yourselves.

55
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:13,750
Holo wouldn't mind having
her debts paid in full.

56
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,458
But know this...

57
00:04:15,541 --> 00:04:17,333
She won't leave me.

58
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:18,666
[MERCHANT A]
All right...

59
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:20,291
My money's on Lawrence.

60
00:04:20,375 --> 00:04:21,833
[MERCHANT B]
I'll take double for Amarty!

61
00:04:21,916 --> 00:04:25,083
[MERCHANT C] Triple!

62
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,833
[MERCHANT D] Give me
12 Irades on Lawrence!

63
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,166
You surprised me.

64
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,041
[BATOS] Looks like
you've gotten yourself

65
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:31,583
involved in some excitement.

66
00:04:31,666 --> 00:04:32,958
Yeah, you're telling me.

67
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:33,958
[BATOS]
You should know,

68
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:35,333
I think Amarty
has discovered

69
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:36,916
a way to make
good on your money.

70
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,375
And most likely...

71
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:42,541
It's not going to be
in a particularly honorable way.

72
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:45,416
Amarty would be devastated
if he knew I was helping you,

73
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,791
so I won't go into
details... but, well...

74
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:51,083
I did want to make
sure you knew about it.

75
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:52,833
Right, why?

76
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,291
Let me put it
to you this way.

77
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:56,625
I can fully understand
why having a companion

78
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,416
to travel with
would be important.

79
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,750
And I would never take
that away from someone.

80
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,750
Interesting...

81
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,583
And what is it
you plan to do

82
00:05:04,666 --> 00:05:06,875
if the boy actually
gives you the money?

83
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:08,500
I'll take what you owe me

84
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:10,166
and give you back
whatever's left.

85
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,958
It's the only
fair thing to do.

86
00:05:12,041 --> 00:05:14,083
I do not like it
when you tease me.

87
00:05:14,166 --> 00:05:15,791
I'm not teasing you,

88
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,333
if he holds up his end
of the deal with me,

89
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:19,041
I'll hold up mine with you.

90
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:20,708
You seem terribly confident.

91
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:22,250
It's not confidence.

92
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,791
I just have absolute
faith in you, Holo.

93
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,916
Good grief...

94
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,500
I believe you to be much
cuter when you are panicking.

95
00:05:29,583 --> 00:05:30,833
Thank you.

96
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,375
I guess that means
I must be growing as a person.

97
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:33,708
Ha...

98
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,708
Staying calm does not
mean that you are growing.

99
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:36,916
It doesn't?

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,500
Your composure
came from evaluating odds...

101
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,416
and from
believing that you had

102
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:41,916
an advantage in the gamble.

103
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,958
That is not growing;
that is only being cunning.

104
00:05:44,041 --> 00:05:46,375
I prefer to think it's
being a skilled merchant.

105
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,208
Refusing the contract entirely

106
00:05:48,291 --> 00:05:50,875
would have been the simplest
way out of the situation.

107
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:52,333
Perhaps...

108
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:53,625
You waited to decide

109
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:55,833
until you judged
the spectator's reactions?

110
00:05:55,916 --> 00:05:58,875
It would have
ended differently

111
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:00,916
had our roles
been reversed, yes?

112
00:06:05,125 --> 00:06:06,208
Hear me, all!

113
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,291
I wish to stay
with Lawrence forever!

114
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,791
I may be indebted to him,

115
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:11,625
but I believe that my debt

116
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:13,916
is simply a bond
that connects us.

117
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,666
If you were to
sever that link...

118
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,666
Then you would
destroy us both...

119
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:19,708
So yes, you may
shame me, nay stone me,

120
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,416
but I shall never
ever accept that contract!

121
00:06:24,875 --> 00:06:26,333
End of scene.

122
00:06:26,416 --> 00:06:28,041
Yeah, that would
definitely be the most

123
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,541
masculine way
to handle things,

124
00:06:29,625 --> 00:06:31,750
but you're not selling
me on it being more mature.

125
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:33,916
Yes, well...

126
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,708
It may be what I would prefer

127
00:06:35,791 --> 00:06:38,458
but I never said anything
about it being more mature.

128
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,916
'Tis overdoing it, really.

129
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,375
Blech.

130
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,208
No, I do not believe it
possible for your masculine way

131
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,375
to be combined
with the mature way.

132
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:47,125
Proper masculinity
seems childish

133
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,000
while proper
maturity seems cowardly.

134
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,541
Well, in that case,

135
00:06:51,625 --> 00:06:53,583
if I were a feminine
and mature wolf,

136
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,541
how would I handle
that situation?

137
00:06:55,625 --> 00:06:58,625
You would smile
and take it, naturally.

138
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:00,666
After accepting the contract
and returning to the inn,

139
00:07:00,750 --> 00:07:03,541
you would kneel, like so.

140
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,541
I know you
accepted the contract

141
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:10,875
because you honestly
thought it a good deal.

142
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:13,208
And I am positive
that you will make

143
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,583
additional arrangements
to secure the outcome.

144
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,083
Misinformation in
the shadows, perhaps?

145
00:07:18,166 --> 00:07:20,875
So you want me to take
you to the festival.

146
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:23,750
You should bribe
me if you truly

147
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
desire this
contract to go your way.

148
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:28,625
[MARC] Are you
sure it's a good idea

149
00:07:28,708 --> 00:07:30,416
for you two to be seen
together right now?

150
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,750
If I kept her
locked in the hotel,

151
00:07:31,833 --> 00:07:33,875
people would think
I really was using her debt

152
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:35,708
as an excuse to take
away her freedom.

153
00:07:35,791 --> 00:07:37,375
Yes, well that's
what you're telling me,

154
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,583
but I have to wonder,
what does the lady say?

155
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:41,125
'Tis the truth, good sir!

156
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:44,041
I am bound by the painful
chains of an enormous debt!

157
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,125
They are far too
heavy for me to bear.

158
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,750
I shall never escape
them in my lifetime.

159
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:51,541
If you could only find it
in your heart to unlock them,

160
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:54,750
I would joyously douse
myself with buckets of flour.

161
00:07:54,833 --> 00:07:58,458
No wonder Amarty fell for her.

162
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,000
I can tell who the real
one being tied down is.

163
00:08:01,083 --> 00:08:02,916
Master!

164
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,916
Nice job.

165
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,958
So, what happened?

166
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:12,083
Okay, well, there were
at least 200 Irades-worth

167
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:14,875
of taxes recorded
in the tax ledger.

168
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,375
Which, as far as the city
council is concerned,

169
00:08:16,458 --> 00:08:18,208
tells us quite a lot
about his finances.

170
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,041
That's about 800 Trenni
silver coins in assets.

171
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,833
What kind of gambling
is there here?

172
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:24,583
The usual: cards, dice.

173
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:26,958
Hare and Hounds
is fairly popular.

174
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:29,083
There is a limit
on the stakes, though.

175
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:32,708
Speaking of gambling...

176
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:34,916
Rumor has it that there
are more than a few bets

177
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,041
on who she'll end up with

178
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:38,333
if Amarty actually
comes up with that money.

179
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:39,541
Oh, really?

180
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,166
Yeah, really.

181
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,333
You've got nearly one
to one odds right now.

182
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:44,708
It's pretty close.

183
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:46,291
I should really find
a way to get in on that.

184
00:08:46,375 --> 00:08:47,750
Do you think they'd let me?

185
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,791
What's the real story
between you two anyway?

186
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:51,125
Even if you have answers,

187
00:08:51,208 --> 00:08:52,958
you cannot always
tell them to others;

188
00:08:53,041 --> 00:08:55,291
it is the way of the world.

189
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:59,250
Example, What is the
purity of your flour?

190
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:00,875
The purity?

191
00:09:00,958 --> 00:09:02,666
Well, you see that's...
it's hard to...

192
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,375
But I am positive you
would still like to know

193
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,041
exactly what I would do
if my debt was cleared.

194
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,750
You are dying to know.

195
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:10,000
No, where did you get
an idea like that?

196
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:12,458
There's only
one thing to do,

197
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,833
we have to find
a way to observe

198
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,708
our competitor's
actions directly.

199
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,041
Sounds sneaky.

200
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:19,125
It's not sneaky;
it's called being prudent.

201
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,000
I mean, think about it,
if he really wants to win,

202
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,333
there's no way
he won't be trying

203
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:24,916
to do the same thing to us.

204
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,375
I wouldn't be so sure.

205
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,000
See, from what I heard,

206
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,791
Amarty was the heir
to a very rich family.

207
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,125
He left home and came
all the way out here

208
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:34,666
with this idea of
making it on his own.

209
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,708
He looks down on
the way the rest of us

210
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,875
make connections with
other merchants in town.

211
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,416
No one helped him;

212
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,416
that kid made a fortune
on his own strength.

213
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,666
He is just like
a heroic prince!

214
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:48,416
Exactly.

215
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:52,333
Maybe that's why he fell
for a pretty little nun.

216
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,458
That's a very heroic
prince thing to do.

217
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,166
Although it probably helps
a lot that the women

218
00:09:56,250 --> 00:09:58,333
in this town
are not very friendly

219
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:00,375
and they don't take
too well to outsiders

220
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,875
if you know what I mean.

221
00:10:02,958 --> 00:10:04,000
It doesn't make
them very desirable.

222
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,041
That's admirable.

223
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:06,541
But I'm a merchant
not a prince...

224
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,041
and unlike him,
I have no problem

225
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:09,541
making use of my connections.

226
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,875
So it might be sneaky
for a little prince,

227
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:14,208
but between merchants

228
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,000
there should be
no complaining.

229
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,166
In the meantime,

230
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,083
do you think
you could find out

231
00:10:21,166 --> 00:10:22,375
some more
information for me?

232
00:10:22,458 --> 00:10:23,583
Batos seems fairly confidant

233
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,791
Amarty will be able
to collect the money.

234
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,458
If he doesn't
collect the funds,

235
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,500
you won't have anything
to worry about, though.

236
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,041
Yes, I suppose that's true.

237
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,666
But I think I just
might be able to turn

238
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,583
a profit from
Amarty's little scheme.

239
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:44,875
Is that a shepherd's
horn I am hearing?

240
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,083
It is.

241
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:47,958
Strange, they're not
normally blown in town.

242
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,208
What would you do

243
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:50,791
if that little shepherd
girl followed us here?

244
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,000
Uhh...

245
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:53,958
I'd probably say
"Hi, how are you?"

246
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,666
Well, that was not fun.

247
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,083
I thought you
would get flustered,

248
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:58,875
but now I just seem jealous.

249
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,041
I don't know what
you're talking about.

250
00:11:00,125 --> 00:11:01,833
That was
extremely fun for me.

251
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,500
Oh, great!

252
00:11:03,583 --> 00:11:05,250
Looks like
the festival's started.

253
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:08,958
I am bored with eating.

254
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:10,833
Perhaps it is time
to join the throng.

255
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,625
I cannot see.

256
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:26,083
Come on!

257
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:36,583
'Tis as if we
have balcony seats!

258
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,625
I'll remember to
thank Amarty for this.

259
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:47,208
What a wonderful performance!

260
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:50,000
The costumes are very admirable.

261
00:12:07,583 --> 00:12:09,541
[music playing]

262
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:39,000
We should go dancing.

263
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,500
Why not?

264
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:46,666
I am delicate.

265
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,708
Do not step on my feet.

266
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,875
I promise nothing.

267
00:12:58,458 --> 00:13:00,166
What are we
going to do next?

268
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,208
We are going to bed next.

269
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,125
Hold on, we're almost there.

270
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,041
Bed? You must
promise to be gentle.

271
00:13:07,125 --> 00:13:08,916
Oh, please.

272
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:29,083
Excuse me.

273
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,458
But this came
while you were out.

274
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:31,875
Marc asked me to
make sure you got it

275
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,375
just as soon as you returned.

276
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,041
Oh, really?

277
00:13:38,166 --> 00:13:41,208
It can wait 'till tomorrow.

278
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,333
No, on second thought...

279
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,791
Sorry, did I wake you?

280
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,458
I have to go meet
Marc again for a bit.

281
00:13:49,541 --> 00:13:51,958
With a letter that smells
like a woman in your pocket?

282
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,375
What woman?

283
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:55,000
I don't know what
you're talking about.

284
00:13:55,083 --> 00:13:56,833
Is there anything
you would like to tell me?

285
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,416
Actually, yesterday
I went to meet with someone

286
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:02,500
who knows a lot of the
legends and stories about Yoitz.

287
00:14:02,583 --> 00:14:05,041
Yes, she happened
to be a woman.

288
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,458
And then?

289
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:08,416
I got some helpful
information from her

290
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:10,125
and I heard
a story about you.

291
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,541
You did?

292
00:14:11,625 --> 00:14:13,041
That's what I said.

293
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,916
There was a legend
about you in Laynos.

294
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,333
[DIANA] They called her
Holo of the Wheaten Tail.

295
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:18,708
That's you, right?

296
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,500
Oh, I cannot be sure.

297
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:21,666
Guess what...

298
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:22,958
The story did talk about

299
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,250
the direction you
came from, that's good.

300
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:27,541
Are you being
sincere with me?

301
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,125
Yes, I am...

302
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:30,875
Apparently you came
from a little forest

303
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,875
just to the east of Laynos.

304
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:34,375
According to the story,
that's where Yoitz is located,

305
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:40,291
in the mountains east of Laynos
and southwest of Nyohila.

306
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,000
Did you choose to
keep this from me

307
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:46,250
in order to surprise
me with it later?

308
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,208
I only wish you
had told me sooner.

309
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:51,791
I'm sorry.

310
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,375
We had to worry
about travelling

311
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:55,083
over so much land before.

312
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:56,708
Now it's not so much.

313
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,666
This letter might
narrow it down even more.

314
00:14:58,750 --> 00:15:02,541
I'm hoping we'll be able
to get there earlier.

315
00:15:02,625 --> 00:15:03,875
Oh.

316
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:12,791
If we got to Nyohila,

317
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:14,791
could you go the rest
of the way yourself?

318
00:15:17,750 --> 00:15:19,583
I don't care if it
takes us half a year,

319
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:21,666
we should find
your home together.

320
00:15:28,291 --> 00:15:29,458
I'm off to go see Marc now,

321
00:15:29,541 --> 00:15:31,291
but I'll be back
before too long.

322
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,541
With a letter that smells

323
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:35,750
like a woman in
your pocket, of course.

324
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,791
You seem pretty
relaxed for someone

325
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,958
who's relying so
heavily on others.

326
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,458
Don't you think?

327
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,541
But I have free time...

328
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,625
Not to mention, I'm making
a ton of money off of you.

329
00:15:54,708 --> 00:15:56,916
What are you talking about?

330
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,791
What did you do now?

331
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:01,250
It was easy money,
I cleaned up.

332
00:16:01,333 --> 00:16:03,333
I knew what the deal
was as soon as you told me

333
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:05,500
Batos thought
there was a scheme.

334
00:16:05,583 --> 00:16:07,541
So you believe
they're precious stones?

335
00:16:07,625 --> 00:16:09,500
Not exactly, but close.

336
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:11,000
Let me put it another way,

337
00:16:11,083 --> 00:16:12,416
they're not precious,

338
00:16:12,500 --> 00:16:14,166
but they are
definitely stones.

339
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,625
It's pyrite?

340
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,833
So why are you asking
me if you already know?

341
00:16:17,916 --> 00:16:19,708
I'm assuming this came
from the fortune teller.

342
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:21,208
Yeah.

343
00:16:21,291 --> 00:16:22,833
They say she attracted the
attention of the inquisition.

344
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,416
So she did the smart thing

345
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,875
and got out of
town immediately.

346
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:27,500
I see...

347
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:29,250
If the church had come here,

348
00:16:29,333 --> 00:16:30,708
the town would
have been in chaos.

349
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,125
You got that right.

350
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,916
Now there's too much
pyrite going around.

351
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,708
She probably bought
it in bulk somewhere

352
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:37,333
and disappeared
as soon as it sold out.

353
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:38,958
And, thanks to her sales pitch,

354
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,500
the church is after them, too,
so its value is escalating.

355
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:45,916
What do you think
it's worth right now?

356
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:49,000
I'm not sure,
but I would guess about 100?

357
00:16:49,083 --> 00:16:50,541
270.

358
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:51,750
What?

359
00:16:51,833 --> 00:16:52,958
I know.

360
00:16:53,041 --> 00:16:54,375
But when the market
opens tomorrow,

361
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,708
the price'll be even higher.

362
00:16:55,791 --> 00:16:58,083
That cheap stone
brings in 270?

363
00:16:58,166 --> 00:16:59,666
As long as
there's a good story

364
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,000
that will make people buy,

365
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:03,250
even worthless junk
can go for a high price.

366
00:17:03,333 --> 00:17:06,208
And now, the women
around here can't

367
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:08,291
get enough of
these things either.

368
00:17:08,375 --> 00:17:10,000
You know how
competitive they are.

369
00:17:10,083 --> 00:17:11,708
Some are making a game
out of how much they can get

370
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,666
wealthier men to pay for
the "mystical miracle stones."

371
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,375
That's making the
price go up even more.

372
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:20,000
Who would have
imagined pyrite

373
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:22,166
would be such
a huge business?

374
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,291
And we aren't just talking

375
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,791
profit in terms of mere
percentage points here,

376
00:17:27,875 --> 00:17:31,625
this could bring
in 10 times the return.

377
00:17:31,708 --> 00:17:33,083
Amarty is most likely making
money faster than lightning.

378
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,958
You're kidding me.

379
00:17:35,041 --> 00:17:37,625
I only got into
the trade a little while ago

380
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:40,708
and I've already
made 300 Irades.

381
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:43,375
Nobody wants to let this
opportunity pass them by.

382
00:17:43,458 --> 00:17:45,750
Okay, so who all
knows about this now?

383
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,666
It was all over
the marketplace this morning.

384
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:49,416
While you and the princess
were busy dancing,

385
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,875
there was a huge scene in front

386
00:17:51,958 --> 00:17:53,333
of the ore merchant stands.

387
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,750
I've failed...

388
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:56,166
I'm a failure as a merchant.

389
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:57,291
No, you'll be all right.

390
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,666
With all the
merchants running

391
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:00,000
around like
crazy over these,

392
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,750
the prices just
keep getting higher.

393
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:03,541
And besides,
if you did fail,

394
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,166
you'd still
have enough cash

395
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,583
to purchase a new
princess, right?

396
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:09,416
Well, in the meantime
I guess I can go ahead

397
00:18:09,500 --> 00:18:11,833
and buy some of these from
you with the credit I have.

398
00:18:11,916 --> 00:18:14,791
Tell me the truth,

399
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:18,000
How are things between
you and your princess?

400
00:18:18,083 --> 00:18:19,333
You have to know by now,

401
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:21,958
Amarty might actually be
able to pay off her debt.

402
00:18:22,041 --> 00:18:23,666
There's no need to worry.

403
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,125
With the money
from this deal,

404
00:18:25,208 --> 00:18:26,625
I'll make more profit.

405
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:28,291
And afterwards, the newly
freed princess will choose me,

406
00:18:28,375 --> 00:18:31,416
and we'll continue
our journey together.

407
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:32,916
You are disgustingly confident.

408
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,250
What else would I be?

409
00:18:45,375 --> 00:18:46,875
Holo, you can read?

410
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:49,291
Hello.

411
00:18:49,958 --> 00:18:52,166
Please tell me,
what do I do when I have

412
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:56,291
no home to go back to?

413
00:18:56,375 --> 00:19:00,000
Tell me what to do.

414
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:02,208
It's only a story.

415
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,458
A lot of those old legends
are far from accurate.

416
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,250
Far from accurate?

417
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:08,041
That's right.

418
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:11,166
You know, sometimes,
when a town changes leadership,

419
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,291
they spread
stories like that.

420
00:19:13,375 --> 00:19:15,291
If so, then
why did you not

421
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:17,458
say anything
to me about it?

422
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:19,583
Because I...

423
00:19:19,666 --> 00:19:21,875
I just didn't
want you to get upset.

424
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:24,041
I really wanted to
tell you, believe me,

425
00:19:24,125 --> 00:19:26,208
but I didn't know how.

426
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:29,208
To think, I have
been talking about

427
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:32,666
going home this whole time.

428
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,208
I am sure that was fun
for you to watch, was it not?

429
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:39,583
Did you have a big laugh?

430
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:40,291
Holo!

431
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:41,000
What?!

432
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:41,875
I... calm down, please.

433
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:42,916
I am calm!

434
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,625
I cannot stop
my mind from racing!

435
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:48,125
You knew about Yoitz
this whole time, did you not?

436
00:19:48,208 --> 00:19:51,541
Admit it!
You knew it all along!

437
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,958
You knew it the very
first day we met!

438
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:57,041
Yes. That certainly
explains a lot.

439
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:58,583
Holo...

440
00:19:58,666 --> 00:20:01,333
You...

441
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,458
You do like your lambs weak
and pitiable after all.

442
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:07,000
Oh, how wonderful it must
have been for you to hear me

443
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:11,541
talk about returning home,
ignorant that it was no more.

444
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:12,875
How delighted
you must have been!

445
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:14,375
That must be why
you were always

446
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:16,333
so kind to me for no reason!

447
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:20,083
You want me to return
alone after Nyohila

448
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:23,208
because you have
already grown tired of me.

449
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:23,916
Admit it!

450
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,958
That's not true.

451
00:20:29,750 --> 00:20:31,875
And now I am alone again...

452
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:34,666
I have no one
waiting for me anymore.

453
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:40,250
I will be alone forever, now.

454
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,916
I'm here, aren't I?

455
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,291
And who are you to me?

456
00:20:46,375 --> 00:20:51,625
No. Who am I to you?

457
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:58,916
No, I do not
wish to be alone.

458
00:20:59,000 --> 00:20:59,916
Holo, please.

459
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,208
Wait, I know...

460
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,458
You will have to mate
with me, Lawrence.

461
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,625
Holo.

462
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:06,000
I am alone now.

463
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,500
But I would not
be if I had a child.

464
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,791
I am in my human form,

465
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:11,791
it would be so simple
to do, really.

466
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:14,041
Please!

467
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,541
Stop it!

468
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:25,291
How could I forget?

469
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:26,958
You are a gentleman, right?

470
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:28,708
You would never
take advantage!

471
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:33,208
Oh, wait, I remember.

472
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:35,625
There is another
who loves me.

473
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,125
And you are not
panicking right now

474
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,208
because you have
already traded me

475
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,000
for 1,000 of your
precious coins, correct?

476
00:21:43,083 --> 00:21:44,458
Well?!

477
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:47,208
Say something!

478
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,833
I'm sorry.

479
00:24:09,541 --> 00:24:18,083

the End of Shallow Thinking.
