1
00:02:27,458 --> 00:02:29,000
No, I can see your point.

2
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:31,250
I just wouldn't buy it.

3
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,166
The truth is I'm looking for
someone with a stock of pyrite.

4
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:43,125
Pyrite?

5
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,375
Yes.

6
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:45,833
Do you remember what I said

7
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:47,791
about Amarty and his method
of bringing in money,

8
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,166
in particular the money
he'd be giving you?

9
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,291
Yes...

10
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,333
Of course I do.

11
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,666
Amarty would be devastated
if he knew I was helping you,

12
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,083
so I won't go into details.

13
00:02:58,166 --> 00:02:59,583
I not only remember that.

14
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:02,708
I also recall that
Diana would rather not

15
00:03:02,791 --> 00:03:05,125
be involved in
business discussions.

16
00:03:05,208 --> 00:03:08,083
I thought this
was to be business.

17
00:03:08,166 --> 00:03:09,708
No, it's a social call.

18
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:12,458
I know this is a huge favor
to ask of you Batos...

19
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:15,541
but I need to know how
I can get Diana to help me.

20
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,416
I'm assuming this has to do

21
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,750
with getting your hands
on the alchemists' stockpile.

22
00:03:19,833 --> 00:03:21,500
That's right. It does.

23
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,291
Of course, it is very
profitable right now.

24
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:26,291
That's not why I want it.

25
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,375
Well, why even
have the stone, then?

26
00:03:28,458 --> 00:03:30,125
Unless you want
to tell the future.

27
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,958
Well, you could certainly
call it a personal gain.

28
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:35,125
I won't deny that's a factor.

29
00:03:35,208 --> 00:03:39,666
However, you should know
the profit I'm looking for

30
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,208
is in no way related to
the current value of pyrite.

31
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:44,875
I guess it's...

32
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:48,666
I guess it's more of
a basic need you could say.

33
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,291
When our cart
sinks into the mud

34
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,083
and ends up getting stuck

35
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:53,458
we use a sort of scale

36
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:54,875
to determine the best
course of action.

37
00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:56,291
Do we leave it behind

38
00:03:56,375 --> 00:03:58,083
or do whatever is
necessary to save it?

39
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:00,583
We weigh the value of the goods
we are carrying, the profit,

40
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:02,708
the amount of cash
on hand, our travel route,

41
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:05,125
not to mention the cost
of paying for assistance.

42
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,625
And we have to consider
if it is worth it to risk

43
00:04:07,708 --> 00:04:09,916
the danger of being discovered
by pillagers and criminals

44
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,291
while we're in such
a weakened position.

45
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:13,875
We measure both
sides of this scale

46
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,416
when deciding whether
or not to abandon our cargo.

47
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,083
Is that the situation
you find yourself in now?

48
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:20,791
Yes.

49
00:04:20,875 --> 00:04:23,416
And I do not want
to abandon my cargo.

50
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:26,375
I will do whatever it takes
to get those goods in my cart...

51
00:04:26,458 --> 00:04:30,750
I don't intend to
leave here without them.

52
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:20,750
That's what I was
waiting to hear.

53
00:05:20,833 --> 00:05:22,875
Any merchant worth his
spices will wait patiently

54
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:25,750
no matter how small or out of
reach an opportunity may appear.

55
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:28,000
Then... You mean...

56
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,416
When you talk to Diana,
say the following:

57
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:32,166
I have come here today

58
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:34,416
to purchase a crate
of white feathers.

59
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:38,083
Thank you so much,
Batos... I will repay you.

60
00:05:38,166 --> 00:05:42,833
All you need to do
to call this even

61
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:46,000
is to share another
ancient legend with me.

62
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,666
What do you think?

63
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:51,208
I sounded just as dignified
as Diana, didn't I?

64
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,875
Is anyone there?

65
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:27,375
Who is it?

66
00:06:27,458 --> 00:06:30,041
Please forgive me for calling
at such a late hour...

67
00:06:30,125 --> 00:06:34,625
My name is Craft Lawrence;
we met the other day.

68
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:42,083
I know this is rude,
and I'm very sorry.

69
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:44,083
I've come here tonight

70
00:06:44,166 --> 00:06:48,333
to purchase a crate
of white feathers.

71
00:06:57,291 --> 00:07:00,750
It appears festivals
really do attract people.

72
00:07:00,833 --> 00:07:02,625
I've had several
visitors today.

73
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:04,916
Having more than
one of you is a rarity.

74
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:11,041
You said you
wanted to purchase

75
00:07:11,125 --> 00:07:13,291
a crate of
white feathers, correct?

76
00:07:13,375 --> 00:07:15,708
Did Batos tell
you to say that?

77
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,708
He did... He was
extremely patient with me.

78
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:21,666
Well isn't that wonderful...

79
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:23,833
Although I find it difficult

80
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:26,166
to believe he would give
in to mere persistence...

81
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:28,875
What kind of business
proposal did you have for me?

82
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:32,208
I'm curious as to what would
sway that stubborn old mule.

83
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,083
My plan was to
ask your permission

84
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,250
to buy some of your pyrite.

85
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:40,416
Oh, not the escalating
pyrite everyone speaks of?

86
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,791
It is... but it's not just--

87
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,625
You have a special reason
for wanting it, right?

88
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,916
I know Batos well enough
to know he would not

89
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,791
have sent you to me if
you were a simple profiteer.

90
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:53,375
You are right
about that much...

91
00:07:53,458 --> 00:07:56,291
Mere profit is not
what brings me to you;

92
00:07:56,375 --> 00:07:58,000
I am here to settle a duel.

93
00:07:58,083 --> 00:07:58,500
Of course you are-- With whom?

94
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,750
With whom...

95
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,291
That's wrong.

96
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:10,833
It's with my cargo.

97
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,208
Your cargo?

98
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,625
A good merchant is always
at odds with his cargo.

99
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,958
Always weighing its value,

100
00:08:17,041 --> 00:08:19,250
considering how
best to handle it.

101
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,250
Researching where
it should go...

102
00:08:21,333 --> 00:08:22,958
If he misjudges
any of these factors,

103
00:08:23,041 --> 00:08:25,250
a merchant will lose every time.

104
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:29,000
Right now, I'm attempting
to steady a piece of cargo.

105
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,541
A piece that's about
to fall out of my cart.

106
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,541
I've thought about it...

107
00:08:33,625 --> 00:08:36,416
I've reconsidered its value,
delivery, and destination...

108
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:38,208
And I've come
to the conclusion

109
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:41,750
that I cannot allow
this piece of cargo to go.

110
00:08:41,833 --> 00:08:43,166
Yes.

111
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:46,041
I would like to purchase
a crate of white feathers today.

112
00:08:46,125 --> 00:08:49,333
It is such an
overly dramatic password.

113
00:08:49,416 --> 00:08:52,041
Would you like to
know to what it alludes?

114
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:56,250
It means you have to
entertain me for a little while.

115
00:08:56,833 --> 00:08:59,000
After all, a happy
bird will drop its feathers

116
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,083
when it flaps its wings.

117
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,041
Those who know the password

118
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,791
determine who
is allowed to see me.

119
00:09:04,875 --> 00:09:07,333
I simply get to enjoy
the stories told by my guests.

120
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:09,875
I don't mind.

121
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:14,875
If pyrite is what you desire,
I will allow you to buy it.

122
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:16,583
Thank you so much.

123
00:09:16,666 --> 00:09:20,916
However, someone else
has already bought some.

124
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,333
How much? And at what price?

125
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,791
Calm yourself, please.

126
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:28,125
The customer bought
on credit alone...

127
00:09:28,208 --> 00:09:31,083
They did not actually
take any goods with them...

128
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,708
The order has been
placed but not yet filled.

129
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,333
On credit?

130
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:39,291
Personally, I would not mind
handing it over to you instead.

131
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:42,208
It was approximately
1,600 Irades-worth

132
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,333
according to
the market value today.

133
00:09:44,416 --> 00:09:46,958
That's the same as
400 Trenni silver coins.

134
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:48,666
I can do that...
What is your customer's name?

135
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:52,000
Please allow me
to handle negotiations.

136
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,500
Why?

137
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:55,458
For obvious safety reasons,
we do not divulge the names

138
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,958
of those who contract
business with alchemists...

139
00:09:58,041 --> 00:09:59,583
I am sure you would not wish

140
00:09:59,666 --> 00:10:01,000
for your name
to be shared either.

141
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:02,500
No, but still...

142
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,166
Do you object?

143
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,833
No.

144
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,583
This is clearly not
an everyday transaction

145
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:09,291
considering there
is a duel involved,

146
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,916
so I will do my best...

147
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:14,208
I shall let you know
the results as soon as possible.

148
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:18,333
I'm sure I will know
something by tomorrow

149
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,541
but I'm afraid I don't
know where to find you.

150
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,708
Oh...

151
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:23,416
In front of
the mineral merchant's stand

152
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:26,041
at the marketplace
should be fine.

153
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,375
I will stay in that area
throughout the day's trading

154
00:10:28,458 --> 00:10:30,458
and wait until
I get word from you.

155
00:10:30,541 --> 00:10:32,125
Money is no object...

156
00:10:32,208 --> 00:10:33,875
well, so long
as they don't ask

157
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,458
for double or
something outlandish.

158
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,916
You can let
your customer know

159
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,083
I am more than willing
to pay quite generously.

160
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:41,208
Again...

161
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,666
I apologize for
coming here so late.

162
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,208
I would not
have minded if you

163
00:10:45,291 --> 00:10:46,916
stayed for the entire evening.

164
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,625
Provided that you had told me
some more old stories of course.

165
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,583
Are you all right?

166
00:10:54,666 --> 00:10:56,208
I'm fine...

167
00:10:56,291 --> 00:10:57,583
It's just...

168
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,125
Can I ask you something?

169
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,541
Yes, please do. Go ahead.

170
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:02,416
Okay...

171
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:03,875
Well...

172
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,000
Have you by chance
heard any legends

173
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:11,375
about pagan gods
becoming mates with humans?

174
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,958
Yes. There are many like that.

175
00:11:15,041 --> 00:11:18,375
Many of them?

176
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:23,166
Unfortunately you
were just leaving.

177
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,291
We will have to discuss
those stories at another time.

178
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:27,583
Enjoy your evening.

179
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,166
Yes... You too...

180
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:33,791
I look forward to hearing
from you tomorrow.

181
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,833
Do your best.

182
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:51,958
So, how did it go?

183
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:54,000
Well, Diana wanted
to work with me...

184
00:11:54,083 --> 00:11:55,583
But someone else
got to her first,

185
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:57,083
so we'll just have
to wait and see.

186
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:58,833
Got to her first?

187
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,291
Yeah...

188
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,416
at this point, I'm relying
solely on what you told me.

189
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,875
Yeah... about
what I told you...

190
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,916
Go ahead...
Tell him what you found out.

191
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,750
Right.

192
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,458
If you pay in Trenni silver,

193
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:15,625
they'll sell
370 coins worth of py--

194
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:16,708
Hey now!

195
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,166
We don't want
everyone to hear!

196
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,583
Well, that's what
it's going for right now.

197
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:22,083
You're kidding me,
370 silver coins...

198
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:23,583
That's unbelievable.

199
00:12:23,666 --> 00:12:25,000
It's not that much...

200
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,833
I gave it some
thought after you left.

201
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:29,625
And I came up with
a very interesting notion...

202
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,666
Take a person like me
who isn't exactly rich,

203
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:33,708
I'm buying,
but I'm just spending

204
00:12:33,791 --> 00:12:35,125
a little extra pocket cash.

205
00:12:35,208 --> 00:12:37,250
Now what do you think
I would do if I was rich?

206
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:40,500
Would I be able to hold back
in the middle of this racket?

207
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:43,083
Well.

208
00:12:43,166 --> 00:12:45,166
I'd be willing to bet there
are quite a lot of people

209
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,166
who stocked up
on it on the side.

210
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,875
Those would be local
merchants who have

211
00:12:48,958 --> 00:12:50,375
their reputations on the line.

212
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,875
They are not like
you travelling merchants

213
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:54,000
who really don't
have anything to lose.

214
00:12:54,083 --> 00:12:55,208
Buying wasn't a problem,

215
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:56,666
but the price
has gone up so much,

216
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,666
they're afraid they
won't be able to sell.

217
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,958
Even if they only
sell a small amount,

218
00:13:02,041 --> 00:13:03,208
their profit would be huge.

219
00:13:03,291 --> 00:13:04,625
So it's still worth
it to them for now.

220
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,083
But if for any reason
people started to get nervous,

221
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:08,333
they would end up desperate
to get rid of their stock.

222
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,750
So I just--

223
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,625
You just sent out your
apprentice to spread the word.

224
00:13:12,708 --> 00:13:15,750
"I met a travelling merchant
blinded by greed.

225
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:18,875
He told me he'd be willing
to buy pyrite with cash."

226
00:13:18,958 --> 00:13:20,041
Is that about it?

227
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:21,458
Yep, you guessed it...

228
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,083
So, what do you want to do?

229
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,375
If you're okay with it,

230
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,666
I could start negotiating
for you immediately.

231
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:28,000
That's perfect...

232
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:29,750
Let's get this.

233
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:32,333
What is it?

234
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,500
It's nothing.

235
00:13:34,583 --> 00:13:38,208
I'm sorry for
everything that's happened.

236
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,708
You idiot.

237
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,333
This is the part where

238
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,250
you're just supposed
to say "thank you."

239
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:45,708
You're right,
I'm sorry, I didn't.

240
00:13:45,791 --> 00:13:47,833
Okay then.

241
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:50,166
Thank you very much.

242
00:13:50,250 --> 00:13:53,666
My friend,
you are a changed man.

243
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:56,125
Up until recently,
you were the epitome

244
00:13:56,208 --> 00:13:58,250
of what a travelling
merchant should be,

245
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,958
and I've seen enough
travelling merchants to know.

246
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:02,208
Just take me...

247
00:14:02,291 --> 00:14:03,625
It never once occurred to you

248
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,000
that I might actually be
a good friend, now did it?

249
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:09,208
What? Of course.

250
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:12,875
Well, I bet it's occurred
to you now. Or has it?

251
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:14,208
Am I still just another

252
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,750
convenient contact
to trade with?

253
00:14:15,833 --> 00:14:17,416
A business associate?

254
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,541
You're not.

255
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:21,291
That's why merchants
who've become

256
00:14:21,375 --> 00:14:23,541
local business owners
have a tendency to fail

257
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,583
after spending so
much time travelling.

258
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,083
But would you like to know
something even more fascinating?

259
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,250
Let me ask you this,

260
00:14:30,333 --> 00:14:32,375
if you were faced
with the possibility

261
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,458
of never seeing me again

262
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,583
would you be running
around town in a panic,

263
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,333
looking for me everywhere?

264
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,375
No... I wouldn't.

265
00:14:40,458 --> 00:14:43,666
Do you realize...
You're doing that right now.

266
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,416
You're going through hell
to save your companion.

267
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,916
When you started
travelling with that girl,

268
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,666
even the way you met,

269
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:52,458
it was simple
coincidence, wasn't it?

270
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:54,333
It was... I didn't think
about it too much,

271
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,333
I just accepted that
she was there.

272
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,958
I feel like I'm watching
myself when I first met Adele.

273
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:04,416
Poets are famous for saying

274
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,541
you can't buy love with money.

275
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:08,916
And preachers tell us
you cannot use money

276
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,750
to get into heaven either.

277
00:15:10,833 --> 00:15:12,875
So even though we all
work as hard as we can

278
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,583
just to get as
much money as possible

279
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,458
we should achieve
something far more important...

280
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:21,958
something that doesn't
cost you any money at all.

[MALE VILLAGER]
Tell that to my wife!

If something ended up taking
us a lot of effort to obtain

283
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:31,000
we would naturally
consider it precious, right?

284
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,416
But, there are also
times when precious things

285
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,583
enter our
lives unexpectedly.

You've been
saving your princess.

It was not just about
physical power, you know.

290
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:48,791
Maybe it's because Amarty
is the one from a good family...

291
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:52,791
but you've been thinking
of him as the prince

Good morning.

Do you want me to
go buy something?

321
00:17:38,958 --> 00:17:41,041
Um, sir...

322
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,458
Just one coin
is more than enough.

323
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:47,000
The other is for you.
Consider it a tip.

324
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:49,083
Perhaps that will tide you
over until I'm finally able

325
00:17:49,166 --> 00:17:51,625
to pay you that
handsome reward later on.

326
00:17:51,708 --> 00:17:54,125
Wait... Do you mean?

327
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,875
You should get going
before your master gets back.

328
00:17:56,958 --> 00:18:00,458
He probably thinks breakfast
is a luxury, doesn't he?

329
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:02,833
Yeah... Thanks,
I'll be right back!

330
00:18:09,125 --> 00:18:11,166
Please don't
go spoiling him.

331
00:18:11,250 --> 00:18:12,833
You had the power to stop me.

332
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:15,000
I do need to have him here.

333
00:18:15,083 --> 00:18:18,083
He'd probably have to stay home
if he ended up malnourished.

334
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:20,125
Well, it was a win-win then.

335
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:21,500
True...

336
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:23,166
And I suppose you need
him to be healthy as well,

337
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:24,625
if you want him
to help you today.

338
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:26,041
That's correct...

339
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,666
In the meantime I'll watch
the market like a hawk...

340
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,583
until around noon
or so, I think...

341
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,208
If it looks like
it's rising too much,

342
00:18:31,291 --> 00:18:33,541
I'll sell enough pyrite
to drop it back down again...

343
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,625
There's no telling how
all of this will turn out.

344
00:18:35,708 --> 00:18:41,208
It's possible my fate lies
on Lunt's narrow shoulders.

345
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,416
Look at how many
prospective buyers there are!

346
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:48,958
But no sellers at all.

347
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,833
This could keep
going on forever.

348
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:53,166
I know, it's averaging
800 Irades now!

349
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:55,375
That's 80 times
the starting value.

350
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,166
I'm glad I held out, then.

351
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,541
Sir...? Can I ask a question?

352
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:00,791
Of course.

353
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,291
I don't think I get it.

354
00:19:02,375 --> 00:19:04,375
How can Lawrence win this thing?

355
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,916
Well, let's think
about it for a second,

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,125
how does an item's value rise?

357
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,791
Well, if there's a big
demand for people to buy it...

358
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:15,208
like if there's not
enough of it to go around.

359
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:17,958
And how does it drop?

360
00:19:18,041 --> 00:19:19,666
I guess the price would drop

361
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,291
if there were
a lot of that item.

362
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,041
Yep, you've pretty much got it.

363
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:24,625
But if you want to
overheat the market,

364
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:27,583
you'd need to make sure some of
the item is sold.

365
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,500
If no one is selling, the only
ones who benefit

366
00:19:29,583 --> 00:19:31,875
are those who already have the
product in stock...

367
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,375
Does that make sense?

368
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:35,333
I think it does, because if some
are still selling

369
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:38,291
it means there are new people
who are obtaining the product,

370
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:40,375
which is why the price
gets higher and higher.

371
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:42,833
You got it.

372
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,708
There's something
important to consider here;

373
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:47,458
he's not trying
to make a profit...

374
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,208
Lawrence's goal is to
keep Amarty from profiting...

375
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:50,791
Which means that
he needs to sell

376
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,750
a large quantity of pyrite
at exactly the right time.

377
00:19:52,833 --> 00:19:56,541
And that in turn will force the
price to drop.

378
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,125
But if Amarty sells even
a second before Lawrence

379
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:01,500
and gets those
1,000 silver coins,

380
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,625
Lawrence would be
completely out of luck.

381
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,416
He has to have
the wherewithal to hold back,

382
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:08,458
then make a big move all
while timing it perfectly.

383
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,916
At this rate,
it'll never stop!

384
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:26,583
The buyers just keep coming.

385
00:20:26,666 --> 00:20:28,041
How many are there now?

386
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,375
Hold on, let me check...

387
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:01,666
Hello!

388
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,333
I hope your morning is going
well, Lawrence.

389
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:05,291
Good morning to you, Amarty.

390
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:07,500
Once the market bell rings...

391
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,333
even more people will
be gathering in the square,

392
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:12,250
so I just figured
I should give this to you now.

393
00:21:12,333 --> 00:21:14,041
What is it?

394
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,166
The payment I promised
you, of course.

395
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,375
These are Lima gold coins!

396
00:21:25,458 --> 00:21:27,250
Yes, I prepared 14 coins for you

397
00:21:27,333 --> 00:21:29,208
at this morning's
opening market rate.

398
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,375
I do apologize if it seems
presumptuous...

399
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:32,916
I was just thinking it might

400
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:34,500
be a little
inconvenient for you...

401
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:38,333
Carrying around
500 silver coins and all.

402
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,958
The exchange rate for this must
have cost you quite a bit.

403
00:21:41,041 --> 00:21:42,625
Well... I won't say.

404
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:45,875
But you can't put
a value on good manners.

405
00:21:46,750 --> 00:21:47,958
Oh I understand...

406
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:50,166
I'm just glad you made
the payment on time.

407
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:54,875
And please go ahead and count
them; I will not be offended.

408
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,125
Now that that's
all taken care of,

409
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:02,250
I'd like to take the
contract for the 500 silver.

410
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:06,041
Yes, of course
you would. Well?

411
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,750
This is perfect.

412
00:24:09,958 --> 00:24:12,708
Next Episode:
Wolf and Trustworthy God.
