1
00:02:33,666 --> 00:02:36,208
No. I do not wish to be alone.  

2
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:37,750
Holo, please.

3
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,333
Oh, wait, I remember. 

4
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:42,250
There is another who loves me. 

5
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,041
And who are you to me?

6
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:51,500
No... Who am I to you?
Please tell me!

7
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:15,958
[HOLO] I do not know
what I saw in him.

8
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:20,416
In the end.. he was really just
an ignorant merchant, no more.

9
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,750
Yes he was. If he
couldn't find a way

10
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:25,041
to maintain the affections
of someone as beautiful as you

11
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,541
I would have to conclude
that he was a failure as a man.

12
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:30,750
Unlike Lawrence,
you will stand by my side

13
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,541
and protect me no matter
what happens, will you not?

14
00:03:33,625 --> 00:03:35,250
I will.

15
00:03:35,333 --> 00:03:37,166
This world could take from me

16
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,750
all the riches I've acquired 

17
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,916
but I would still
have you to love me.

18
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,500
Craft Lawrence is nothing
but a spineless coward.

19
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:51,041
[LAWRENCE]
Shut up!

20
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:55,125
You can't say
I didn't warn you.

21
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:56,541
You were so cock
sure of yourself

22
00:03:56,625 --> 00:03:59,125
when all this
started but now...

23
00:03:59,208 --> 00:04:01,000
I never even saw it coming.

24
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,833
How could I let this happen?

25
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:05,458
You let down your guard.

26
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,291
Tell me I'm wrong.

27
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:11,458
No, you're right.

28
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:13,875
Anyway, what did
you want to ask me?

29
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:15,291
If you're looking for a loan, 

30
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:17,125
I'm afraid I can't
help you out right now.

31
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:19,250
I'm trying to see
which way the wind blows.

32
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:21,208
I feel like a navigator.

33
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:22,291
Like I'm in
the middle of a storm

34
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,000
plotting a course to dry land.

35
00:04:24,083 --> 00:04:25,708
The market is just
so hard to predict.

36
00:04:25,791 --> 00:04:26,958
Don't bother trying.

37
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,125
You can't keep pyrite's
value from rising

38
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,458
anymore than you could
control a rising tide.

39
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:33,541
The more people who
want to buy the pyrite,

40
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:36,000
the longer those holding out
are willing to wait to sell.

41
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:38,000
I don't see the signs

42
00:04:38,083 --> 00:04:40,250
that the prices will
drop off any time soon.

43
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,250
Unless you can
convince our Almighty God

44
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:44,000
to tell you what's
going to happen tomorrow.

45
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:46,666
I'll just have
to turn myself into a god.

46
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,958
Amarty won't let
himself be snared

47
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,958
by any typical drop in prices.

48
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:56,166
Wait, are you planning
on crashing it?

49
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:59,583
Can you think of a better way?

50
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:02,083
No choice, be it
one way or the other,

51
00:05:02,166 --> 00:05:03,875
I've got to make sure
all his precious rocks

52
00:05:03,958 --> 00:05:07,125
are worthless by the time
the sun sets tomorrow.

53
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:16,791
It's got to be a plan
Amarty will never see coming.

54
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:21,208
One that will crash the market,
is that even possible?

55
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,291
Now feast your eyes.

56
00:05:31,458 --> 00:05:33,708
You've got a lot
of faith in rocks.

57
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,000
You can't drop
the wheat trade for mining.

58
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:39,416
My sources say it'll
double in value tomorrow.

59
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,875
You sure about that?

60
00:05:40,958 --> 00:05:42,625
Practically certain.

61
00:05:42,708 --> 00:05:44,500
If you don't keep your
shops open for the festival

62
00:05:44,583 --> 00:05:47,333
you'll miss out on
a golden opportunity.

63
00:05:47,416 --> 00:05:48,583
So you're telling us 

64
00:05:48,666 --> 00:05:51,083
we shouldn't be buying
wheat now, is that it?

65
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,583
Ah, Master Lawrence.

66
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:09,833
A letter?

67
00:07:09,916 --> 00:07:12,000
Yes sir, your friend asked
me to write it down for her.

68
00:07:12,083 --> 00:07:15,083
She only left
a few minutes ago.

69
00:07:15,583 --> 00:07:18,208
But don't worry,
I was very happy to help sir.

70
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:20,666
What?

71
00:07:20,750 --> 00:07:22,875
200 silver in cash.

72
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,666
300 silver-worth
of iron pyrite

73
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:29,458
and properties totalling
another 200 silver.

74
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:31,166
This is Amarty's net worth.

75
00:07:39,583 --> 00:07:43,875
Yes.

76
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:47,041
This looks like
Amarty's handwriting.

77
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:51,000
Holo... I'll bet
she was able to talk

78
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,875
him into signing another bond.

79
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:16,041
Give me all the cash I have
stored with you immediately!

80
00:08:16,125 --> 00:08:18,166
I said now!

81
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:29,333
What's wrong with him?

82
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,375
He's that merchant.

83
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,083
Hey!

84
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:39,791
Watch where you're going!

85
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,166
Excuse me.

86
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:45,291
Sure.

87
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:52,541
Good evening.

88
00:08:55,083 --> 00:08:57,375
There's nothing for you
to look so nervous about.

89
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:01,708
I'm only here to talk business.

90
00:09:02,458 --> 00:09:05,166
Which is all the more reason
for me to be concerned.

91
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:10,083
May I bend your
ear for a moment?

92
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:11,500
Why not...

93
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,625
I presume this has
to do with the contract.

94
00:09:15,708 --> 00:09:16,958
It does.

95
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,750
Well? What exactly
did you have in mind?

96
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,458
Let's get straight
to the point then,

97
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,916
I would like to sell you
a certain amount of iron pyrite.

98
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:30,500
500 Trenni silver-worth of
Iron Pyrite, to be more precise

99
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:33,458
and to be fair, I'll accept
its current market value.

100
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,375
You're joking.

101
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,625
I'm completely serious.

102
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:41,625
You must be aware
by now of the profits

103
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,083
I'm making off
the sale of iron pyrite.

104
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,041
What could you
possibly hope to gain

105
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:48,000
by increasing
my wholesale stock?

106
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:49,875
Are you saying
the rumors are true?

107
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,500
Do you care more
for your precious silver

108
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:52,791
than you do for Holo?

109
00:09:52,875 --> 00:09:54,500
Are you really that cold?

110
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,208
In the name of Saint Francis,

111
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:58,750
saint of merchants and this
Lohen Merchants Association,

112
00:09:58,833 --> 00:10:01,416
I swear I shall
do the following:

113
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,583
I will profess
my undying love!

114
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,375
He is just like
a heroic prince!

115
00:10:06,458 --> 00:10:08,708
There's only one thing
to do, we have to find

116
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:11,208
a way to observe our
competitor's actions directly.

117
00:10:11,291 --> 00:10:12,958
Sounds sneaky.

118
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:17,500
You are a heroic prince, Amarty.

119
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:19,083
Oh, don't mind me.

120
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,250
You can be sure, I do
still care about the girl.

121
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:25,375
Holo has already woven herself
into the fabric of my life.

122
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:27,083
Then why?

123
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:28,875
I'm not giving you the pyrite

124
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:30,916
in what would be considered
a traditional sale.

125
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,791
I'd like to sell
it to you on credit.

126
00:10:33,875 --> 00:10:36,333
It's like this, I
want to give you

127
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:38,833
500 Trenni silver
coins-worth of pyrite

128
00:10:38,916 --> 00:10:43,708
tomorrow evening, but at
its current market price today.

129
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:45,458
Well, then shouldn't
we wait and discuss

130
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:47,500
this transaction
tomorrow evening?

131
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:48,916
No.

132
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:51,250
Not for this deal,
you pay me right now.

133
00:10:51,333 --> 00:10:56,875
I will take 500 Trenni
silver from you tonight,

134
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:59,125
and tomorrow evening,
I will give you the amount

135
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,208
of iron pyrite
that 500 Trenni buys

136
00:11:01,291 --> 00:11:04,708
at today's closing price.
Understand?

137
00:11:04,791 --> 00:11:08,791
So if the price for iron pyrite
happens to go up tomorrow,

138
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:11,250
you're still agreeing
to sell it back to me

139
00:11:11,333 --> 00:11:13,833
at the lower price
the pyrite's fetching today.

140
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:17,500
You are a really smart kid,
exactly right.

141
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:20,333
However, if the value of
iron pyrite goes down tomorrow,

142
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,541
I'm agreeing to buy it from
you at today's higher price.

143
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,375
Right.

144
00:11:25,458 --> 00:11:27,375
So it's really no different
from any standard exchange.

145
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,291
When you sell
something before

146
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,166
the price jumps,
you're angry.

147
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:34,208
But if you sell before
the price drops you're happy.

148
00:11:34,291 --> 00:11:39,333
There's nothing
different about that...

149
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,416
Hold on, that's wrong.

150
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,250
That's correct, but why?

151
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,916
Because you don't need cash.

152
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,583
You just buy the pyrite today

153
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:48,166
with the promise
of tomorrow's sale.

154
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:51,000
Once you had it, regardless
of how its worth fluctuated,

155
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,958
you simply had to pay
back the original price.

156
00:11:54,041 --> 00:11:57,583
If pyrite becomes more
valuable you make a profit.

157
00:11:57,666 --> 00:11:59,291
That's how credit works. 

158
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:00,875
So when tomorrow comes,

159
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,875
if the price of pyrite
has dropped by any amount,

160
00:12:02,958 --> 00:12:04,625
I'll make a profit
on the exchange

161
00:12:04,708 --> 00:12:07,083
because I already sold
it to you at today's price.

162
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:10,875
Wow, there's no end
to ways we can make money.

163
00:12:10,958 --> 00:12:14,250
Well, do you think
you understand it now?

164
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,875
I guess so, but let
me just say it again

165
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,500
to make sure we're clear,

166
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:21,375
I'll buy 500 silver-worth
of pyrite from you now

167
00:12:21,458 --> 00:12:24,291
and if its value goes up
tomorrow then so do my profits.

168
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,166
But if the bottom
should fall out tomorrow,

169
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:30,458
then it's too bad for me...
I could lose everything.

170
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,708
It's sort of like--

171
00:12:31,791 --> 00:12:33,208
No.

172
00:12:33,291 --> 00:12:36,125
This is exactly like
I'm challenging you to duel,

173
00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:40,416
winner take all.

174
00:12:44,375 --> 00:12:45,833
The deal's
still in my favor,

175
00:12:45,916 --> 00:12:48,625
even if we assume
the price of pyrite drops.

176
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,708
I simply gauge
the heat of the market

177
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:53,041
and sell my stock
before it goes down again.

178
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:58,833
I can bail out at any time

179
00:12:58,916 --> 00:13:01,125
but you have to
stay until the end.

180
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:02,500
It doesn't seem
fair that my side

181
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:03,833
of the trade is
protected with

182
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,583
a moderate increase in value

183
00:13:05,666 --> 00:13:08,125
while yours
offers you no way out.

184
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:10,166
A contract like
this is dishonorable.

185
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:12,166
I have to sign
my name in a bet

186
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:13,916
where I can only
gain if you lose.

187
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,583
I disagree.

188
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:18,416
It seems to me the risks
weigh evenly on both of us.

189
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,541
You're still forgetting

190
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:22,625
one of the most
important variables here.

191
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:25,291
Holo could shred that
contract she signed with you.

192
00:13:30,250 --> 00:13:32,583
Even if you manage

193
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:37,291
to pay off Holo's debt
of 1,000 silver coins...

194
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:39,166
for you, everything
hinges on whether or not

195
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,250
she'll accept your proposal.

196
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:42,666
The risk which I am facing

197
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,000
is vastly inferior to the one
you've chosen to bear.

198
00:13:44,083 --> 00:13:46,000
The two of you have
had a serious falling out,

199
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:48,625
or so I've heard.

200
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:50,041
Since we've been together,

201
00:13:50,125 --> 00:13:53,250
Holo has cried in
my arms only 3 times.

202
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:57,000
She is irresistible
when she's like that.

203
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,125
But she's also
as stubborn as a mule.

204
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,500
She ends up saying
things she regrets later.

205
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,625
So I wouldn't rely on rumors.

206
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:06,458
I'll take your bet.

207
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:10,708
Because... Because...

208
00:14:10,791 --> 00:14:14,000
At first I was certain
I would turn down

209
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,000
your challenge because

210
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,541
I thought it would
appear spiteful.

211
00:14:16,625 --> 00:14:18,791
I knew I'd take
everything of yours,

212
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:21,833
but now I see
you leave me no choice.

213
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,375
So, if that's the way you want
it to play out, so be it.

214
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:24,833
By the time
I'm finished with you,

215
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:28,500
there'll be nothing left
of you except your shame.

216
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:33,000
Fine. Then let's make
this official with a handshake.

217
00:14:36,416 --> 00:14:39,208
May the best man win.

218
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,083
Cheers.

219
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:48,666
That's good beer.

220
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,625
Any bright ideas?

221
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:51,958
Wheat sales usually pick up

222
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:53,458
at the end of
the festival, don't they?

223
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:54,875
They do.

224
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:59,000
At that time, there's a rumor
I'd like you to spread.

225
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,333
If it's risky,
you can count me out.

226
00:15:01,416 --> 00:15:03,833
There's a risk if you
go spreading it yourself,

227
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:09,500
but there's no harm if it
comes from the boy, right?

228
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:11,416
When the time's right,
do me a favor...

229
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:13,708
I need him to
say this loudly.

230
00:15:13,791 --> 00:15:18,333
"Looks like the price of
wheat's gonna keep going up."

231
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,208
Hold on, that's your big plan? 

232
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:27,583
You want to lower the price
of pyrite with a rumor?

233
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,125
Yes.

234
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:30,916
Most of the people
buying pyrite

235
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,208
came to the festival
to sell their goods.

236
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:35,750
Normally they purchase wheat
with the profits they've made,

237
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,791
in order to stock up
for the winter.

238
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,833
If they hear that the price
of wheat is going up,

239
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,375
everyone will panic and sell off
their remaining pyrite

240
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,666
and purchase
what they came here

241
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,458
for in the first
place, the wheat.

242
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,083
I'm hoping that the rumor
of increasing wheat prices

243
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,291
will cause a run
on the market

244
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:52,916
and the price of pyrite
will inevitably fall.

245
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:56,083
And when the run
reaches a certain point,

246
00:15:56,166 --> 00:16:00,750
the pyrite will plummet down
to practically nothing.

247
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,416
I'm sorry to
hear that, Lawrence.

248
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:04,875
I had you pegged as a much
smarter merchant than that.

249
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,000
What if I told you
I could start the run

250
00:16:07,083 --> 00:16:09,958
by selling off
a huge stock of pyrite?

251
00:16:10,041 --> 00:16:11,250
How much?

252
00:16:11,333 --> 00:16:13,458
Well, 1,000 Trenni.

253
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:17,250
1,000? No, think of the risk
you're taking! If it drops--

254
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:19,833
I don't care how much
its value drops.

255
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,291
Have you lost your mind or
are you really that stupid?

256
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:25,458
No, I just need
500 silver-worth

257
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,416
of pyrite by
the time the dust settles.

258
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,416
And if I can
manage to do that,

259
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:34,000
how far it falls
won't matter to me.

260
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,166
I see!
You're selling on credit!

261
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:37,875
Precisely.

262
00:16:37,958 --> 00:16:39,750
So, I guess
that's my only part

263
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:41,208
in your little scheme, huh?

264
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:42,750
There's just one more thing.

265
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:45,541
I need you to buy up
pyrite for me.

266
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,541
Wait, please don't tell
me you found the buyer

267
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,416
before you found
the iron pyrite.

268
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,000
I've been so busy lately,
I didn't have the time.

269
00:16:53,083 --> 00:16:54,708
You're dead.

270
00:16:54,791 --> 00:16:56,791
I have to buy in a way
that can be kept secret

271
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,958
so I don't spook the market.

272
00:16:59,041 --> 00:17:00,500
Lawrence...

273
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:02,083
You know all
the local merchants.

274
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,625
How hard would
it be to get each of them

275
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:04,958
to buy a little
extra iron pyrite?

276
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:06,250
You may have to pay a premium

277
00:17:06,333 --> 00:17:07,625
to get them to do it
and that's okay.

278
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:09,250
You can tell them if
they buy a larger amount,

279
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:12,875
I'll pay them in
Lumione gold coins.

280
00:17:12,958 --> 00:17:16,041
Of course, I would
pay you for your efforts,

281
00:17:16,125 --> 00:17:17,791
which would make
it worth your while.

282
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:18,958
I can't do it.

283
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,375
Perfect, we can-- 

284
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:24,583
Marc, you do realize
I'm paying you, right?

285
00:17:24,666 --> 00:17:27,250
It'll be much more
than you're used to making.

286
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:30,291
How can you turn down
such an easy score?

287
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,875
Easy score.

288
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,708
You know I'm right. 

289
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:35,583
I'm not asking for
an investment from you.

290
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:37,375
You'll get paid in cash.

291
00:17:37,458 --> 00:17:40,125
What could you
possibly have to lose?

292
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:44,166
My guess is you could pay me
10 Lumione gold coins at most.

293
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:47,708
That's an unbelievable price
for simply acting as my buyer.

294
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,500
What's the problem?

295
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,166
It's not like I'm asking
you to go climb a mountain,

296
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:54,250
dig a new mine, and bring
the stuff back yourself.

297
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:56,083
You want me to go around

298
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,875
my market and buy up
a lot of pyrite.

299
00:17:57,958 --> 00:17:59,458
That's much worse.

300
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:00,916
What's worse about that?
You have no risk in this deal.

301
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,500
You're buying pyrite
through your connections.

302
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,833
Is that really
so much to ask?

303
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:08,791
Okay, I could see
why you'd think that,

304
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:12,083
but that's because
you're a travelling merchant.

305
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,583
But I'm a town merchant

306
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:17,458
so this marketplace is
the whole world to me.

307
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:19,750
Town merchants who
try to make quick money

308
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:22,666
at the expense of others suffer
for it in their daily business.

309
00:18:22,750 --> 00:18:25,708
This store is my life,

310
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,083
but it's not just my good
name at stake here.

311
00:18:29,166 --> 00:18:30,750
There's the question
of my honor.

312
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:35,333
Not to mention the honor
of my wife, our families,

313
00:18:35,416 --> 00:18:38,708
even my regular
customers would suffer.

314
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:41,958
Everything's on the line.

315
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:43,666
You have to
understand, Lawrence.

316
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,416
I've built a life here

317
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,041
and nobody will
trust a town merchant

318
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:50,125
who jumps at every chance
to make money the easy way.

319
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:52,833
Sure, it's no big fault
if we make a little money

320
00:18:52,916 --> 00:18:56,166
on side deals from time
to time. Everybody does that.

321
00:18:56,250 --> 00:18:58,708
But buying up pyrite
to help you crash the market

322
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:01,750
for a mere 10 gold coins
is totally different.

323
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:04,666
How do you think people here
would treat me after that?

324
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:06,416
To them I'd be
nothing more than a leech

325
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,541
that destroyed his business

326
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,625
because he wanted
to take a stupid gamble.

327
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:14,166
What can you possibly offer
me that would match that loss?

328
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:17,375
I know I'm just a small shop

329
00:19:17,458 --> 00:19:20,291
but that makes my name
that much more important.

330
00:19:20,375 --> 00:19:21,833
If I lost my reputation

331
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:25,500
I don't think there's
any amount of gold

332
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:29,041
that would be enough
for me to buy it back.

333
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:32,166
I can't risk that...
I'm sorry.

334
00:19:34,958 --> 00:19:36,958
Forgive me.

335
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,333
After meeting your companion,
I understand.

336
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:41,500
A girl like that is only
going to have her heart

337
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,291
changed by
the grandest of gestures

338
00:19:43,375 --> 00:19:44,708
and even that may not work.

339
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,041
I only saw you together once 

340
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:48,166
but I could already tell
how much trouble she was.

341
00:19:48,250 --> 00:19:50,416
Just show a little backbone.

342
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:55,208
The innkeeper showed me
a signed marriage certificate.

343
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,333
As her guardian, all I have
to do is add my signature

344
00:19:58,416 --> 00:20:00,958
and their marriage
will be complete.

345
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:04,541
If I hadn't seen that 

346
00:20:04,625 --> 00:20:08,041
I might feel a little bit
more certain about all this.

347
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:09,750
In life, the only
certain thing is death.

348
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:14,791
But you would have
already quit by now

349
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:16,916
if you didn't
still have some hope.

350
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,541
Yeah.

351
00:20:18,625 --> 00:20:20,291
You're a complete ass.

352
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,708
Is there anyone else
who can help?

353
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:24,625
I guess I can try asking
Batos to see if he has any.

354
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,041
You know,
why don't you ask him

355
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,083
if he'll go and talk
to that woman for you.

356
00:20:30,166 --> 00:20:31,791
Wait, what woman?

357
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:34,291
Diana, she's the
chronicler you met.

358
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,708
You didn't forget her?

359
00:20:36,791 --> 00:20:39,416
She's the de facto
governess over that district.

360
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,916
For as long as I can remember, 

361
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,541
anyone who wants
to get to the alchemists

362
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:44,916
has to do it through her.

363
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,041
As a group, they make
easy targets for the church.

364
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:50,958
You wouldn't believe
what they do to maintain

365
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,875
some amount of privacy.

366
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,666
There wouldn't be
nearly as many of them

367
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:56,333
around here if she didn't
watch over them like she does.

368
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,750
And?

369
00:20:57,833 --> 00:20:58,791
And don't you think
alchemists might have pyrite?

370
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:00,083
It's the perfect way
to make a trade

371
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:01,541
without affecting the market.

372
00:21:01,625 --> 00:21:03,041
You simply get it from people

373
00:21:03,125 --> 00:21:04,458
who couldn't care
less about the market.

374
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:07,083
Yes, I'm a genius, I know.

375
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:09,041
Of course,
the alchemists' pyrite

376
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,958
will have been
completely untouched.

377
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:13,708
I'm sorry, I wish
I could do more for you.

378
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:14,708
I can't be seen
as a part of this plan

379
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:17,708
but you know
I'm pulling for you.

380
00:21:17,791 --> 00:21:20,708
Please, you've helped me
quite enough, thank you!

381
00:21:20,791 --> 00:21:24,958
Your idea is
money in the bank.

382
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,875
Now that I think of it...

383
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:31,000
It'd require some
finesse on my part...

384
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,125
but I can probably
crank up the old rumor mill

385
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,583
without it coming back on me.

386
00:21:34,666 --> 00:21:36,375
Really?

387
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:38,541
Check back,
I'll do my best to see

388
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,666
if I can find some
interested buyers for you.

389
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,125
The wind will blow your way.

390
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:46,041
Knock 'em dead.

391
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:47,875
Sure.

392
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,541
Yeah!

393
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:55,666
Oh, Lawrence, you're
so cute when you're excited.

394
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:58,125
If she could see the look
on your face right now,

395
00:21:58,208 --> 00:22:01,541
your little princess
would be yours for sure.

396
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:04,250
What does that mean?

397
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:12,416
