1
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,416
There are so many people.

2
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,041
I could stay here
and watch this all day.

3
00:02:23,541 --> 00:02:27,416
Somehow it all comes
back to food and drink.

4
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,791
At least this town looks
pretty normal for a change.

5
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,166
I mean, everything appears
to be running smoothly.

6
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:34,875
Even as the wolf
packs battle fiercely

7
00:02:34,958 --> 00:02:37,375
among the trees for
the land they claim...

8
00:02:37,458 --> 00:02:39,291
From far away
the forest may appear

9
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:41,333
surprisingly peaceful
depending how you see it.

10
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:45,666
If someone had
exceptional hearing

11
00:02:45,750 --> 00:02:48,416
couldn't they tell what
was going on from afar?

12
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,708
Do you see that
ship over there?

13
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,875
It seems the tax
they are levying

14
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:54,416
on its goods is too high

15
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,583
and so the ship's owner
doesn't want to sell.

16
00:02:56,666 --> 00:02:59,625
"I already told you the price
for these nails is set."

17
00:02:59,708 --> 00:03:02,208
They call that a hostage tax.

18
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,875
They can see from his fur

19
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,666
that he's got money so they
try to slip in extra taxes.

20
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:08,916
The skinny man
is saying something

21
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,541
in response
about the expedition

22
00:03:10,625 --> 00:03:11,708
to the north being cancelled

23
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,208
and how that has
thrown off the markets

24
00:03:13,291 --> 00:03:16,000
in the whole city.

25
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:19,250
He's telling the man he should
be happy to get anything at all.

26
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:21,875
That cancelled expedition
is causing trouble everywhere.

27
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:23,625
He is threatening
to take the man

28
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,791
and his fur to
the courts to settle it.

29
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:28,875
There are four other groups

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,208
all having a similar
conversation.

31
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,875
The tax is too high.

32
00:03:32,958 --> 00:03:34,750
The cancelled expedition.

33
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,041
The status of
entering the town.

34
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,958
You did not really order
those for my benefit, did you?

35
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:50,166
My drinking serves
you in some way.

36
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,500
If I am drunk on
alcohol then you are free

37
00:03:52,583 --> 00:03:55,541
to get drunk on
the prospect of future profits.

38
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,875
Thinking about business
is cheaper than alcohol

39
00:03:57,958 --> 00:04:00,583
and to be sure it has
less of a hangover.

40
00:04:00,666 --> 00:04:04,125
When I am drunk
I am less likely

41
00:04:04,208 --> 00:04:05,666
to interrupt your planning

42
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,583
with my obstinate
chattering,

43
00:04:07,666 --> 00:04:09,333
and more compliant
to your whims.

44
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:13,041
It is a relatively
inexpensive investment.

45
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,000
You are a wise wolf.

46
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,208
Well, your face always
appears so much less

47
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:19,916
of a frowning mask when you
are thinking about business...

48
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,458
and that makes my
drinking all the more fun.

49
00:04:22,541 --> 00:04:27,416
No!

50
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,250
How could this
great wolf be undone

51
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:32,291
by as few as 7 drinks
of such a watery stash?

52
00:04:32,375 --> 00:04:35,583
You're worn out from
travelling too, remember...

53
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:37,958
Try to get some rest.

54
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:42,416
Don't you worry...

55
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:46,666
I won't do anything too
ridiculous while you're asleep.

56
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:50,125
Oh, I very much doubt that.

57
00:04:50,208 --> 00:04:53,875
Time for her highness
to close her eyes.

58
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:07,416
Open for business?

59
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:09,458
[HELENA] Yes, sir! Come in.

60
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:12,291
I just finished
patching my apron.

61
00:05:12,375 --> 00:05:14,583
Like it?

62
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,041
It's so nice I can't
take my eyes off of it.

63
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,583
That's why.

64
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,125
I always wondered why people

65
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,250
had so much trouble
looking at me in the eyes.

66
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:24,375
It's because my apron
is too pretty...

67
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,916
Or, they could be
afraid of your eyes...

68
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,791
After all people
do tend to get

69
00:05:28,875 --> 00:05:31,083
a bit intimidated
around beautiful things.

70
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:33,791
Too bad because I can tell
instantly if I trust someone

71
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:35,291
by looking in their eyes

72
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:38,333
but if they never look,
I'll never know.

73
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,291
And do you trust me?

74
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:45,916
Travelling merchants
are much better flirts

75
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,125
than regular townspeople.

76
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,625
So, will you be
eating or drinking?

77
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:52,875
I'd like two orders
of roasted tail

78
00:05:52,958 --> 00:05:56,250
packaged to take with me.

79
00:05:57,375 --> 00:06:00,083
The cook just left to purchase

80
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:01,791
supplies at the port.

81
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:03,458
I don't have
anywhere else to go.

82
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:04,833
There's really no rush

83
00:06:04,916 --> 00:06:06,541
In that case...

84
00:06:06,625 --> 00:06:08,083
There's no better
way to pass the time

85
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,625
than with something
to drink in your hand.

86
00:06:09,708 --> 00:06:12,041
Okay, might as well.

87
00:06:13,666 --> 00:06:15,666
It's unusual that a travelling

88
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,458
merchant actually
stops in for food,

89
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:19,708
normally they come by
looking for information.

90
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:24,125
I usually pay for both.

91
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,041
I was curious about
one thing in particular.

92
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:29,750
What's with all the merchants

93
00:06:29,833 --> 00:06:31,333
camped out in front
of the town entrance?

94
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:32,833
Oh, those are all the merchants

95
00:06:32,916 --> 00:06:34,833
who are involved in trading
furs this time of year.

96
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:37,958
Is that so?

97
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,500
Yeah, it's about the fur.

98
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,291
Most of them are
the foreign merchants

99
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:44,791
who come from
all over to buy fur,

100
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,000
and the rest of them
are craftsmen who sell tools

101
00:06:47,083 --> 00:06:50,375
to make the fur into
pretty things to wear.

102
00:06:50,458 --> 00:06:52,333
The reason they're
all waiting so patiently

103
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,250
is because the town council

104
00:06:54,333 --> 00:06:56,666
is having its big
meeting right now

105
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,250
to decide whether or
not even to sell the fur.

106
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,541
You mean the 50 man
meeting, right?

107
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:00,833
That's right.

108
00:07:00,916 --> 00:07:02,541
Trading fur is
forbidden until its over.

109
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:05,125
The ban on fur trading
means those craftsmen

110
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,833
will sit on the money

111
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:08,666
they've saved to
buy processing tools

112
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:10,458
until they're
sure it'll be lifted.

113
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:12,041
I don't understand why people

114
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,750
are so hesitant
to sell the fur.

115
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:15,416
I've heard it has to
do with the expedition

116
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,958
to the north being cancelled.

117
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:19,333
So nobody wants to be first

118
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:21,083
in the market
with a large amount.

119
00:07:21,166 --> 00:07:22,750
That's business. Like me.

120
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,875
My place is usually
packed with people

121
00:07:24,958 --> 00:07:26,666
at this time of year.

122
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,458
I wonder if it'd
be okay to sell furs

123
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:33,708
to the merchants
gathered outside the town.

124
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,000
Those merchants only
buy for a good price...

125
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:40,041
unlike the knights and
mercenaries going on expedition.

126
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:44,666
Sometimes they even pay me
with beautiful fur clothing

127
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:48,500
that's really only fit
for a princess to wear.

128
00:07:48,583 --> 00:07:50,875
I make double when
they pay me like that.

129
00:07:50,958 --> 00:07:52,333
But before the fur
becomes clothing

130
00:07:52,416 --> 00:07:54,208
it is relatively inexpensive.

131
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:56,250
If it gets sold
before being processed

132
00:07:56,333 --> 00:07:59,291
the towns people miss out
on most of their profits.

133
00:07:59,375 --> 00:08:01,750
You're a really smart guy.

134
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:04,666
But I haven't told you anything
you couldn't have learned

135
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:08,250
from any other hostess in town.

136
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,000
If you repeat to anyone
what I'm about to tell you...

137
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:13,000
I'll deny it.

138
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,833
Deal.

139
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:23,916
There are about
40 men in that meeting

140
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,083
who are thinking
about barring

141
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,583
the merchants outside
town from buying any fur,

142
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,291
even though they know it might

143
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,500
enrage the rest of
the people in the fur trade.

144
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,208
Who gave you this information?

145
00:08:34,291 --> 00:08:35,916
Who knows?

146
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,541
Men usually show
their appreciation

147
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:41,250
of a bar by leaving
good and drunk.

148
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,875
Are you sure you
don't want another drink?

149
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:46,458
You're definitely putting me
in the mood to lose myself.

150
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,833
[COOK] Two
roasted tails ready!

151
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:52,375
Okay! Now I have
a question for you.

152
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:54,750
Do you have a wife?

153
00:08:54,833 --> 00:09:01,041
I'm free to do what I want
when it comes to trade.

154
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:06,625
However, she does keep me
on a pretty short leash.

155
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:10,416
Well, whoever she is,
she's the luckiest girl I know.

156
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,291
Darn the luck.

157
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,875
Those are loaded with furs...

158
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,750
and those... and
those... and those too.

159
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:30,333
And that's good news...

160
00:09:30,416 --> 00:09:32,250
There's lots of money.

161
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,083
I will not allow it.

162
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:40,875
You may never sell my tail.

163
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,791
You'd be too tough to skin.

164
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:47,333
But I can see in your eyes you
are willing to sell anything.

165
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,666
Come on that's only
half the story.

166
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:51,000
Think about the strawberries

167
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:52,666
you've seen me pick
from town to town

168
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:55,041
while we travel have you
ever seen me sell one of them?

169
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:58,250
I only ever resell what
I first have purchased,

170
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:01,541
It's one of the few hard
and fast rules I live by.

171
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:03,375
So I trust your
information expedition

172
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:04,916
was fruitful as always.

173
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,500
Yes, it seems as if things

174
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,333
are about to get quite
interesting around here.

175
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,166
Oh yeah. Care to make a wager?

176
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:12,916
A bet?

177
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,500
I have some meat
in this package.

178
00:10:14,583 --> 00:10:16,125
Tell me which animal and
what part without opening it

179
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:19,375
and you can eat
anything you want tonight.

180
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:26,791
You saw all those
travelling merchants

181
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,916
camped out
in front of town, right?

182
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,625
There has to be
something going on with them

183
00:10:30,708 --> 00:10:33,416
or they'd never waste so
much time just waiting there.

184
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,583
They must have
already gotten wind

185
00:10:37,666 --> 00:10:39,875
about the 50 man
meeting's decision

186
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:43,583
not to let foreign merchants
in on the fur trade this year.

187
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,333
My ears aren't
great but I will hear

188
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:48,208
if you try to
open that package.

189
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,125
I know that.

190
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,416
Have you got it?

191
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,041
Give me time.

192
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:56,125
Well, then I'll talk
this out some more.

193
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,000
To orchestrate
something on this scale

194
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,583
would take a large
and powerful group.

195
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,208
The Western
Merchants Association

196
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:03,916
is known for their fur craft.

197
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,500
Or it could be
some large company

198
00:11:05,583 --> 00:11:09,041
looking to monopolize
the entire fur trade business.

199
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,291
Regardless of that...

200
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,666
You...

201
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,250
Have you figured it out?

202
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,750
I think the preconditions
of this bet we made

203
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:21,458
were unfairly tilted
before we made it, Lawrence.

204
00:11:21,541 --> 00:11:23,208
Well it's a little too late

205
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,708
to be mentioning
that now don't ya think?

206
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:26,958
I suppose so, but...

207
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,500
What's your guess?

208
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:31,833
I don't know the name
you have for it...

209
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:35,375
but it is from those river
rats with the big flat tails.

210
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:39,291
Yeah.

211
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,833
I told you the wager
was unfair from the outset.

212
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:42,833
You already knew?

213
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:45,041
When we first
came to this town

214
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:47,625
it puzzled me because
I had no memory of it.

215
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:49,333
But that has changed now.

216
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:56,291
All of my memories came
flooding back to me.

217
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:58,750
When I smelled it,

218
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,416
the memory brought back
tears to my eyes

219
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,875
and I knew in an instant
what was in your package.

220
00:12:05,833 --> 00:12:08,041
You did that on purpose.

221
00:12:08,125 --> 00:12:10,375
Do you think
I would take advantage

222
00:12:10,458 --> 00:12:13,166
of your kindness
with a deception?

223
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,875
Yes, You always
manage to do this to me.

224
00:12:27,875 --> 00:12:32,000
I know I will never
be able to forget your scent.

225
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:35,625
Nor I yours.

226
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:39,500
You sound foolish
when you are serious.

227
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,166
Well excuse me for trying.

228
00:12:42,250 --> 00:12:46,083
Does it truly
bother you that much?

229
00:12:46,166 --> 00:12:48,708
You made more than enough
money when we were in Kumersun

230
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:51,416
to open up a shop
of your own, did you not?

231
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:55,916
Yeah... plenty in fact...

232
00:12:57,125 --> 00:13:01,083
I do not have any right to keep
you from opening up your shop.

233
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:05,000
You should be free from trouble
so that you can settle down.

234
00:13:05,083 --> 00:13:09,791
That is all
that I want for you.

235
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:15,708
Settle down, you've
got a point there.

236
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,125
[AROLDO] A road to the north?

237
00:13:27,208 --> 00:13:28,541
Yes.

238
00:13:28,625 --> 00:13:30,875
Well there hasn't been
all that much snow this year...

239
00:13:30,958 --> 00:13:33,583
so the journey
shouldn't be too bad.

240
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:36,875
My plan right now
is to go to Nyohila.

241
00:13:36,958 --> 00:13:40,208
So, you're going into
lands that are pagan.

242
00:13:40,291 --> 00:13:46,791
Well, I suppose that is
the life of a merchant.

243
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:51,583
You carry a bag of money around
to wherever the profit leads.

244
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,583
No matter how big
that bag of money gets

245
00:13:53,666 --> 00:13:56,625
none of us can take
it with us when we die.

246
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:59,625
Then why even bother
making money at all?

247
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:02,666
It's a waste of time
if you ask me.

248
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:05,375
Why bother having any job
at all for that matter,

249
00:14:05,458 --> 00:14:09,375
like running
an inn for example?

250
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,541
Well, that is true.

251
00:14:13,208 --> 00:14:14,541
Will you be
leaving us soon, then?

252
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:15,875
Not yet...

253
00:14:15,958 --> 00:14:19,708
I want to wait till
the 50 man meeting is over.

254
00:14:19,791 --> 00:14:21,833
You'll only be able
to make half the journey

255
00:14:21,916 --> 00:14:23,833
with the horse
you have right now.

256
00:14:23,916 --> 00:14:25,333
After that
you'll have to trade

257
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:27,416
it in for
a longer haired breed.

258
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,375
I think I saw one in the stable.

259
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,791
The man who owns that
horse is a northerner.

260
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:34,083
He probably knows more details

261
00:14:34,166 --> 00:14:36,083
about the road
you'll be travelling too.

262
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:37,416
What's his name?

263
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,791
His name?

264
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,541
The man's lived here for years

265
00:14:40,625 --> 00:14:43,083
and I can't believe I've
never bothered to get his name.

266
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:44,750
The only thing
I really know about him

267
00:14:44,833 --> 00:14:49,291
is that he gets
fatter with each passing year.

268
00:14:49,375 --> 00:14:55,750
I'm sorry... but getting
old is not for the weak.

269
00:14:57,125 --> 00:15:00,291
If I run into him I'll mention
you'd like to talk with him.

270
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,750
I'd appreciate it.

271
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,500
Of course, if you're
determined to wait

272
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:08,708
'till the 50 man meeting is over
you might be here 'till spring.

273
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:12,083
Their meetings can go
on for that long huh?

274
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:19,833
A town's fate is directly
tied to the men who run it.

275
00:15:19,916 --> 00:15:21,500
Some years these
meetings are easy

276
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,666
and other times it
can turn out to be

277
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,875
bad for the whole town.

278
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,375
But we all have free will...

279
00:15:28,458 --> 00:15:31,291
We can act against fate.

280
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:32,791
We're all accountable
for our mistakes

281
00:15:32,875 --> 00:15:35,041
but we make up for
them as best we can.

282
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,375
I can't disagree
with you on that.

283
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,875
You've been here for
three nights, right?

284
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,083
What's your name?

285
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:51,083
The name's
Craft Lawrence, sir.

286
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,791
My name is Aroldo Ecklund...

287
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,000
In my younger days I could
have made you a belt

288
00:15:56,083 --> 00:15:58,125
that you'd have
been proud to wear...

289
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:02,375
Now all I can offer is a warm
room and a good night's sleep.

290
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,833
Well that's better than a belt.

291
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:05,791
He took 5 days to ask me.

292
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,750
Why did it only take you
3 days to ask his name, Aroldo?

293
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:11,916
If you remember,
your fifth day here

294
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,125
was also the first
time we spoke.

295
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:16,041
You are not what
I would consider

296
00:16:16,125 --> 00:16:18,083
an excellent
conversationalist.

297
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,500
[EVE] ...and you?

298
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:21,833
I talk...

299
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:23,958
Then how about
we have a chat.

300
00:16:24,041 --> 00:16:26,208
Don't you have
business with Rigoro?

301
00:16:26,291 --> 00:16:29,208
Yeah.

302
00:16:29,291 --> 00:16:31,375
Something to drink.

303
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,166
Excuse us.

304
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,041
I don't know why
that man insists

305
00:16:40,125 --> 00:16:42,416
upon heating up his wine.

306
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,250
You appear hesitant with me.

307
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:46,708
Would you mind telling me why?

308
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:50,583
It's not every day that I get
to talk with a female merchant.

309
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,583
I'm always more cautious

310
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,541
when I am dealing with
things that are unknown.

311
00:16:55,625 --> 00:16:58,125
You're the first to
see through my disguise

312
00:16:58,208 --> 00:17:00,125
in the past couple of years.

313
00:17:00,208 --> 00:17:03,333
Well, we passed each other in
front of the inn this morning.

314
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:07,125
My companion has good
instincts about these things.

315
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:10,416
One should never underestimate
a woman's intuition...

316
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:13,333
Though I'd normally never
say that dressed like this.

317
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:17,208
I've come to trust
the instincts of--

318
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,916
My name is Fleur Bolan.

319
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:22,208
Though the name Fleur isn't
really suitable for business,

320
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,333
so around here I'm known
mostly as Eve Bolan.

321
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,375
My name is Craft Lawrence.

322
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:27,875
Well, which is it?
Craft or Lawrence?

323
00:17:27,958 --> 00:17:30,791
For business I go by Lawrence.

324
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:32,416
And I just go by Eve...

325
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,666
I don't like the way Bolan
sounds... And trust me...

326
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,500
I know exactly how much
respect I'd get as a merchant

327
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:42,000
if I went to work a frilly
pink dress and some make up.

328
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:45,333
So don't even bother trying
to compliment my looks.

329
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:47,833
Sure I understand.

330
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,625
I'd prefer not to be
seen as a woman at all

331
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,833
but unfortunately
I'm rather gregarious

332
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,625
so I'm usually the one
who blows my own cover.

333
00:17:56,208 --> 00:17:58,625
I'm quite charming
and I like to talk.

334
00:17:58,708 --> 00:18:00,500
Well I'll let you
know whether or not

335
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,583
you're charming
a little later on.

336
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:06,791
However, we're only really
meeting each other tonight

337
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:10,333
and I still don't know why
you'd have any interest in me.

338
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:13,666
It starts with the fact
that for whatever reason,

339
00:18:13,750 --> 00:18:15,541
Aroldo really
seems to like you...

340
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:16,916
He's a stubborn old fool

341
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:18,833
but he has
a good eye for people.

342
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,333
Though he isn't
very likeable himself.

343
00:18:21,416 --> 00:18:24,416
What's that thing
he's always saying?

344
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:30,833
I'm going on
a pilgrimage next year.

345
00:18:30,916 --> 00:18:32,041
So this girl with you...

346
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,250
Girl?

347
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,583
You know, your companion.

348
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:35,833
She's a woman.

349
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,500
It's odd for
a merchant to bring

350
00:18:37,583 --> 00:18:39,416
a woman along
with him isn't it?

351
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,000
We just travel together.

352
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:43,583
I don't think I could explain
it to you even if we were drunk.

353
00:18:43,666 --> 00:18:45,541
I'm not trying to pry.

354
00:18:45,625 --> 00:18:48,250
It appears that you two are
very comfortable with each other

355
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,166
and I can tell it isn't
money that keeps you together,

356
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,125
so she should be fine
with our conversation.

357
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,708
At least I hope so.

358
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,083
Business can
be complicated around here.

359
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,500
I couldn't
just walk up to you

360
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,791
on the street
and say 'let's talk.'

361
00:19:00,875 --> 00:19:02,666
That wouldn't
have worked at all.

362
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,166
It's why I mentioned
Rigoro first.

363
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,000
But the only reason I said
that was to get your attention.

364
00:19:10,083 --> 00:19:11,666
You do want to meet
with Rigoro, don't you?

365
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,166
Yes.

366
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:14,833
Do you mind if I ask
what interest he is to you?

367
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:18,375
Rigoro is this
town's chronicler.

368
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:19,958
I was hoping he'd
be able to tell me

369
00:19:20,041 --> 00:19:23,166
about the old stories
and legends from this area.

370
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:28,750
That is definitely
a new one to me.

371
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:31,500
Not an angle
on the fur trade?

372
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,791
Of course, I am
a merchant after all.

373
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:35,375
I would never turn down

374
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:37,125
any insights that could
lead to a greater profit...

375
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:40,166
But one should be cautious.

376
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:43,000
My companion
would prefer I... not.

377
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:45,625
To be sure, his library
is filled with stacks of books

378
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:48,041
that date back many generations,
past anyone's recollection.

379
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:50,833
He's a gloomy
bearded sot who'd love

380
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,666
to lose himself
in his books all day.

381
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:55,166
But first
he'd resign as secretary

382
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,666
of that meeting if he could.

383
00:19:56,750 --> 00:19:58,041
He hates it.

384
00:19:58,125 --> 00:19:59,375
Is that so?

385
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:01,500
All the townspeople
who'd like to sit down

386
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:04,125
and talk with him would
make a long list indeed.

387
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,166
If you were just to
approach him out of the blue

388
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,291
you'd be greeted
with blank stares

389
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:09,625
and get thrown
out for sure.

390
00:20:09,708 --> 00:20:12,416
I have a business relationship
with the church in town here.

391
00:20:12,500 --> 00:20:15,625
It's been ongoing and
we've remained on good terms.

392
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:17,416
In addition to
his other duties,

393
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,916
Rigoro has a regular
job as a scribe

394
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,958
for some of their
administrative needs...

395
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:25,333
so we've known each
other for some time now.

396
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:28,291
I know I've only recently
made your acquaintance

397
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:31,083
Mr. Craft Lawrence
but if I may be so bold,

398
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:32,875
you seem to operate
on a different level

399
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:35,083
from your average
merchant in the square.

400
00:20:35,166 --> 00:20:37,125
You're giving me
too much credit.

401
00:20:37,208 --> 00:20:40,791
It's premature to
shake on it just yet.

402
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,208
You don't strike me as someone

403
00:20:43,291 --> 00:20:45,250
who'd get sweaty palms
over a business deal.

404
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:46,708
I haven't been able to
read anything off you

405
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:49,375
throughout this
entire conversation.

406
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:50,791
Let's try this.

407
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,208
I don't really
need to know what type

408
00:20:52,291 --> 00:20:54,875
of business you're in,
but I do have another question.

409
00:20:54,958 --> 00:20:56,583
Go ahead.

410
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:59,583
What do you charge
for introductions?

411
00:21:01,541 --> 00:21:04,458
I'm not after money if
that's what you're saying...

412
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:12,291
but I would like someone
to talk to every now and again.

413
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,750
I'm absolutely serious.

414
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,750
I know... it sounds
a little strange...

415
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,416
But you wouldn't
believe what comfort

416
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,166
it is to me to
have a fellow merchant

417
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:24,666
I can talk to without having

418
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:26,666
to keep up this
troublesome disguise.

419
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,541
It's worth more to me than
any of your Lima Gold coins.

420
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,625
I notice you didn't
say Lumione gold,

421
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:33,541
so it must have its price.

422
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,666
A girl's got to make a living.

423
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:38,500
In the end it all comes
down to money, doesn't it?

424
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:41,500
Of course...

425
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:44,541
I've never met this companion
of yours so this is just us...

426
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:46,458
I hope she's fine with that...

427
00:21:46,541 --> 00:21:49,250
I've heard a jealous woman
can ruin even the best wine.

428
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:51,666
Oh I don't think
she'll get jealous.

429
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:53,291
Are you sure...?

430
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,875
I've never known any man

431
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,875
who could predict
the thoughts of a woman.

432
00:21:56,958 --> 00:21:59,250
Or one who understood
what she really meant.

433
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:05,166
It's not like there's anything
salacious going on between us.

434
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,958
I just wouldn't
mind having someone

435
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:08,833
to talk to every so often.

436
00:22:08,916 --> 00:22:10,125
I may look rough--

437
00:22:10,208 --> 00:22:14,541
but you're charming
and like to talk.

438
00:22:16,083 --> 00:22:18,416
I'm guilty on both counts.

439
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,916
As long as my companion
doesn't get angry about it.

440
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:24,375
Of course, we wouldn't
want that, now would we?

441
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,625
