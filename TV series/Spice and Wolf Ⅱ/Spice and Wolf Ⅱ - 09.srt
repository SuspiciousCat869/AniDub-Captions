1
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:07,916
Holo...

2
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,250
I said I was sorry...

3
00:02:09,333 --> 00:02:10,750
Geez...

4
00:02:10,833 --> 00:02:12,666
C'mon don't be like this...

5
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:14,625
I know I was gone too
long and I apologize.

6
00:02:14,708 --> 00:02:17,416
I guess I was hoping
you'd understand.

7
00:02:31,875 --> 00:02:33,916
'Tis narrow here.
Far too narrow.

8
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,458
You're right.

9
00:02:35,541 --> 00:02:37,041
It is a little inconvenient...

10
00:02:37,125 --> 00:02:39,791
But I have to admit, I actually
like old places like this.

11
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,291
Why is that?

12
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,041
It has character from the wear

13
00:02:43,125 --> 00:02:45,833
and tear it's experienced
over the years.

14
00:02:45,916 --> 00:02:49,166
Think of how a tool
slowly changes as you use it.

15
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,666
Gradually, it gets worn down,

16
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:53,333
but it ends up being
the only one you want to use.

17
00:02:53,416 --> 00:02:55,083
It sounds similar to the way

18
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:56,916
a river changes shape
throughout time.

19
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,458
No, that's not quite the same.

20
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,041
Sorry but I'm going to have
to disagree with your analogy.

21
00:03:03,125 --> 00:03:04,458
Oh...

22
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:07,125
Well what about
a person's heart, then?

23
00:03:07,208 --> 00:03:09,791
You refer to it
as a soul, right?

24
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,916
Huh? A soul?

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,541
Possibly...

26
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:17,416
Although, I guess you'd
have to look at it somehow.

27
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,291
One would need
to see all the places

28
00:03:19,375 --> 00:03:22,583
where it's been chipped
away, injured, and repaired.

29
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,041
Then, you could
recognize it as your own.

30
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:28,083
You could say, "this is mine."

31
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:36,208
May I help you, princess?

32
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,208
Very well.

33
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:44,250
If we could find a way to pull
out your soul and look at it.

34
00:03:44,333 --> 00:03:47,000
I believe I can
say with all certainty

35
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:49,916
that it would be
the same color as me.

36
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,916
I could see that.

37
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,250
I think it's reasonable to say

38
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:56,833
you've worked your way
into my soul somehow;

39
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,458
kind of like a poison.

40
00:03:58,541 --> 00:04:00,083
Yes, of course!

41
00:04:00,166 --> 00:04:01,458
I am the poison.

42
00:04:01,541 --> 00:04:04,875
You did fall for
my smile, did you not?

43
00:04:04,958 --> 00:04:07,500
That makes me wonder what
the color of your soul must be.

44
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,375
Let me think...

45
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:16,208
It is multi-colored.

46
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,458
It sounds as
if you are feeling

47
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,250
a pang of possessiveness,
is that it?

48
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:25,791
If I were in your shoes,

49
00:04:25,875 --> 00:04:27,750
I would probably
feel the same way.

50
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:32,875
It's right.

51
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:35,083
No, but it is
a fork in the road.

52
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:36,958
You should tell me how you will

53
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:39,875
manage to subjugate
your egotistical passions.

54
00:04:48,208 --> 00:04:49,916
Ok well, let's see...

55
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,250
This is indeed
a very sensitive issue.

56
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,250
I'm sure most people
suffer from their passions

57
00:04:54,333 --> 00:04:56,958
in one way or another.

58
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:59,250
But might it be you
are only asking me this

59
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:02,708
because you are by nature a
jealous and dominant creature?

60
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,750
It seems to me,
you madam, are projecting.

61
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:07,750
And if that was the truth?

62
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,750
Well, first I'd have to consider

63
00:05:09,833 --> 00:05:11,666
the situation from
your point of view...

64
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:14,500
Then I could come up with
the most accurate solution.

65
00:05:14,583 --> 00:05:16,125
I got it...

66
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:20,291
You cannot
control your emotions.

67
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,875
Even if you know you'll
hate yourself later for it.

68
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,833
So, you think it's right, then?

69
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,291
Yes.

70
00:05:32,375 --> 00:05:34,541
However...

71
00:05:34,625 --> 00:05:36,833
Possessiveness
and self-hatred...

72
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:38,750
What a shame.

73
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,166
I do appreciate
your noble attempt

74
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:43,125
at stepping into my shoes

75
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:45,083
to determine
my innermost desires...

76
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,750
But unfortunately...

77
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:51,916
The only thing you figured
out is what you want me to be.

78
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,750
I will never
understand why males

79
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,208
are attracted to jealousy
and weakness in females...

80
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,666
Oh, I am a mere
woman who is so distressed

81
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,375
by wanting you
that I hate myself!

82
00:06:02,458 --> 00:06:04,708
You wish for them
to desperately cling

83
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,833
to your terribly generous hand.

84
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,541
'Tis pathetic.

85
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,500
Well, shall we go?

86
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,416
I wonder...

87
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,916
What?

88
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,375
Now, I am only asking
this to tease you, but...

89
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:23,583
Would you like to
know how many I've had?

90
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,583
My heart is far too delicate

91
00:06:32,666 --> 00:06:34,416
to suffer that specific
bit of information.

92
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,416
Okay...

93
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:41,958
I heard he can
be pretty difficult,

94
00:06:42,041 --> 00:06:43,833
so let's try to behave.

95
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,833
I do not know what
you could possibly mean;

96
00:06:45,916 --> 00:06:47,458
I always behave...

97
00:06:47,541 --> 00:06:49,583
But I shall
certainly watch over you.

98
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,750
Maybe you should just go back
to the inn and take a nap.

99
00:06:52,833 --> 00:06:55,416
That is not a bad idea...

100
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,916
Of course...

101
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,416
I would not be counting sheep

102
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,916
on top of the bed,
if you know what I mean.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,625
Fine.

104
00:07:02,708 --> 00:07:05,708
So just how many is it?

105
00:07:07,416 --> 00:07:08,916
You're right...

106
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,750
And evidently it
seems that I am even

107
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:13,041
an idiot amongst my own kind.

108
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:26,958
[MERTA] Hello there.

109
00:07:27,041 --> 00:07:28,583
Who might you be?

110
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:30,041
I'm Craft Lawrence.

111
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:32,083
Miss Eve Bolan
said I was coming?

112
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,333
Yes...

113
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:34,833
We've actually
been expecting you.

114
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,875
Please come in.

115
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:53,541
I'm sorry about the wait.

116
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:25,125
[RIGORO] You know, I can't
get enough of that reaction.

117
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:28,125
I agree, Rigoro.
It's quite nice.

118
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,458
It amazing isn't it?

119
00:08:30,541 --> 00:08:33,000
All you need to do is give
it a little bit of effort,

120
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,583
and you can keep the plants
green for the entire year!

121
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,291
Yes, Fleur did
tell me about you.

122
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:40,166
Something about
a strange request

123
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,791
that only I could help you with.

124
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,666
Yes, it's very
nice to meet you.

125
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:46,416
My name is Craft Lawrence,
but everyone calls me Lawrence.

126
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:50,000
And I'm Rigoro, Rigoro Dedri.
Nice to meet you.

127
00:08:50,083 --> 00:08:52,500
This is my travelling companion.

128
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,500
My name is Holo.

129
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:59,333
I love it! That was hilarious!

130
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,375
It is wonderful to meet you.

131
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,208
Likewise.

132
00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,583
I have to admit it...

133
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:07,958
Your reaction to my prized
garden made me very happy.

134
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:10,250
What can I do for you
to show my gratitude?

135
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:14,333
Well actually,
what Eve told you was right.

136
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:16,833
She said you would be able
to help me find books

137
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:19,875
that tell the old stories
and legends from this town.

138
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,458
Is that true?

139
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,125
Yes, that is true.

140
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,708
But I can't believe that's
really what you came here for.

141
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,625
Fleur told me...

142
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,083
I guess it's Eve?

143
00:09:29,166 --> 00:09:31,708
She may act tough but
she can be quite mischievous.

144
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:33,291
Which make sense...

145
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:35,458
After all, you're not
frowning with a long beard.

146
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,708
You're quite a bit
friendlier than expected.

147
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,958
Looks like she got us both.

148
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,791
Who knows what
she'll say about me next?!

149
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:45,625
Although, I suppose
some people don't find me

150
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,666
to be very friendly at all.

151
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:49,583
I guess that's
because recently

152
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:51,875
I've been refusing meetings
as much as possible.

153
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,791
I should tell
you I am a merchant

154
00:09:53,875 --> 00:09:55,250
from outside the city.

155
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:56,958
Are you sure it's
okay for the two of us

156
00:09:57,041 --> 00:09:58,291
to be talking like this?

157
00:09:58,375 --> 00:10:00,250
Yes. You came
at the perfect time.

158
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:02,291
Maybe this is what
they call God's providence.

159
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:07,875
I actually just
returned from the meeting...

160
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,000
It concluded and finally
adjourned not long ago.

161
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,458
Well...

162
00:10:13,541 --> 00:10:15,958
As one would expect of
a merchant who is travelling

163
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:17,916
with such
a beautiful companion.

164
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,291
You don't let your guard down.

165
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:22,916
I imagine constantly
protecting yourself

166
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,041
with wit and finesse
can get exhausting.

167
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:29,208
The back of the back
is the front, am I right?

168
00:10:29,291 --> 00:10:31,791
I could see you were
surprised that the meeting

169
00:10:31,875 --> 00:10:34,583
ended early,
it flashed across your face.

170
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:37,166
Don't forget I'm the scribe

171
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,041
for the 50 man
meeting for a reason.

172
00:10:39,125 --> 00:10:41,000
I can understand
what is behind

173
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,708
a person's
changing expression.

174
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,041
Now, your expressions
are more difficult to read,

175
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:47,000
but when I combine them

176
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:48,833
with the movements of
your lovely companion,

177
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:53,000
everything starts
to become clearer to me.

178
00:10:57,750 --> 00:10:59,000
That was impressive.

179
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,666
It's really not.

180
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,375
That's just
a little trick of sorts.

181
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:04,250
And if I'd had ill intentions,

182
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,458
I wouldn't have told
you the truth, right?

183
00:11:06,541 --> 00:11:08,416
Besides, even if
I did know what people

184
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,333
were thinking,
what good would it do me?

185
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,833
I'm a terrible communicator!

186
00:11:12,916 --> 00:11:15,250
So does that make me
a failure as a merchant?

187
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:18,166
Yeah. I'm sorry but it does.

188
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:21,166
It's also why I'm not
too popular with women.

189
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:27,250
All the books that you're
wanting are in the basement.

190
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:31,375
Looks like the back
of the back is the front.

191
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:34,583
I do like that he
was looking at my face.

192
00:11:34,666 --> 00:11:37,833
I've never seen anyone
do a trick like that before.

193
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,833
I believe he was telling the
truth about no ill intentions.

194
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:42,541
He is almost like a child.

195
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:46,041
But, for someone with
such a skill by your side,

196
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:48,750
I am certain that you would

197
00:11:48,833 --> 00:11:52,500
lead a worry free
and relaxing life indeed.

198
00:11:52,583 --> 00:11:56,500
Do you ever not
have ill intentions?

199
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:01,083
By the way...

200
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,875
I'm dying from curiosity.

201
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:06,958
So I'm sorry,
but I have to ask you...

202
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:11,583
Why do you want to know about
the legends from this town?

203
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:19,041
She's searching for her legend.

204
00:12:19,125 --> 00:12:20,958
Her legend?

205
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,916
She's tracing back her lineage,

206
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,375
and I'm helping guide
her back to where she's from.

207
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,583
That's the reason
why we're here.

208
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:30,416
I understand.
You must be headed north then.

209
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,000
We are...

210
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:34,291
But we don't know
the exact location yet.

211
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:36,166
Right now we're
just using a legend

212
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:38,666
she remembers to try
and find our way there.

213
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,541
How very fascinating...

214
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,541
I'm not sure why,
but I'm sure you have a reason.

215
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:46,250
Such is the way of
the world, I suppose.

216
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,583
Did anyone tell
you that children

217
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,041
who are brought from the north

218
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,666
sometimes end up
staying in this city?

219
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:56,041
It's hard to
imagine anything better

220
00:12:56,125 --> 00:13:00,083
than returning
safely to one's home.

221
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,083
Now this is all of them...

222
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:07,750
I thought it would be easier

223
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,458
if you went ahead
and took everything with you.

224
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:12,083
I won't feed you for
3 days if you drop those.

225
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,750
Why don't you
hand a few over to me?

226
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,875
That is why I normally
would have you read them here.

227
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:23,500
However, I trust
Fleur implicitly...

228
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,208
And if she can
trust you, Lawrence,

229
00:13:25,291 --> 00:13:27,333
then I will trust you as well.

230
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:29,958
I think It would be nice
if we all thought that way.

231
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:31,500
True...

232
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,500
I promise to
be careful with them.

233
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,500
It must be easy
to wave your hand

234
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,916
like that when you're
not holding anything.

235
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,208
And it must be easy to babble

236
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:48,416
like that when
you're being a big baby.

237
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:53,041
I hope you do not
expect flattery.

238
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,208
It would only overexcite you.

239
00:13:55,291 --> 00:13:56,666
I have no idea what you mean.

240
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,125
Flattery annoys me.

241
00:14:41,541 --> 00:14:42,916
Good grief.

242
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,958
You do know even gluttony
has its limits, don't you?

243
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:47,833
What a nice evening.

244
00:14:49,041 --> 00:14:51,333
Yes. What a nice evening.

245
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,583
True, but if every
night was like this one...

246
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:57,875
I'd get way too spoiled.

247
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:02,125
It is truly bittersweet
sometimes, is it not?

248
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:04,708
Yes, it is quite bittersweet.

249
00:15:09,458 --> 00:15:10,875
[EVE] Are you sure...?

250
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,041
The master will not be happy
if you go to another inn.

251
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,833
It will only be for one day.

252
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:17,333
We would never be so rude
as to change our lodgings.

253
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:20,166
Good...

254
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:21,708
Do you drink a lot?

255
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:25,708
Look at the two of us
and take a wild guess.

256
00:15:25,791 --> 00:15:27,958
[AROLDO] I talked with a fur
trader from the north earlier.

257
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,250
He said there wasn't
much snow on the ground...

258
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,708
So travelling up there should
be fairly convenient for you.

259
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:37,250
Thank you for finding
that out for us.

260
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:41,458
If you want to know more
details, his name was, uh...

261
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,791
Kolka Koose.

262
00:15:44,875 --> 00:15:47,166
Oh was that what his name was?

263
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,208
It doesn't
really matter, does it?

264
00:15:49,291 --> 00:15:51,291
He's staying on
the fourth floor...

265
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:53,000
He might have
mentioned that

266
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:55,083
he's normally
free in the evenings.

267
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:58,083
If you need to know more,
you should go ask him.

268
00:15:58,166 --> 00:16:05,041
Thank you both...

269
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:08,250
I wish the two of
you a good night.

270
00:16:31,958 --> 00:16:40,541
You are such a mess.

271
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:45,333
I'm scared.

272
00:16:45,958 --> 00:16:48,916
Of what... I'm right here.

273
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:52,333
Yes, I know.

274
00:16:59,416 --> 00:17:03,166
Ya know I didn't think
anything could scare you.

275
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:05,875
Everything is going
fine now, isn't it.

276
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:07,958
We haven't gotten into
any trouble to speak of...

277
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,125
And the road north
should be easy...

278
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,791
Did you notice?

279
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:17,208
The two of us haven't
been fighting at all.

280
00:17:26,541 --> 00:17:31,208
I am still afraid, though.

281
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:35,083
And this is precisely
what I am afraid of.

282
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:38,333
You have to know.

283
00:17:38,416 --> 00:17:41,458
It's the end of
our journey isn't it?

284
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:44,583
Well, yes, that is scary.

285
00:17:44,666 --> 00:17:46,208
However...

286
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,875
There is something
that is much worse.

287
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:54,333
'Tis all right if
you do not understand.

288
00:17:54,416 --> 00:17:56,125
Because it would
disturb me greatly

289
00:17:56,208 --> 00:18:00,541
if you knew what I was
thinking all of a sudden.

290
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:04,291
I do not mind if
you go downstairs.

291
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:09,666
Just please do not
try to make me jealous.

292
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:11,458
It's a lucky thing
for you I like selfish,

293
00:18:11,541 --> 00:18:13,916
possessive girls
who hate themselves.

294
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:22,458
Did you two have
a big fight or something?

295
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:25,041
Does it seem as though
we don't get along?

296
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:26,666
Absolutely.

297
00:18:26,750 --> 00:18:28,708
Well, I'm a merchant, you see.

298
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:30,916
The old man isn't...

299
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,208
We don't have
much to talk about.

300
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:35,208
Oh, yeah, I met with
Rigoro today, by the way.

301
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:36,625
You were right...

302
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:38,708
His beard was quite gloomy...

303
00:18:38,791 --> 00:18:40,083
I'm sure...

304
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:43,000
I don't know how you
handled someone so depressing.

305
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:45,375
That skill of his
was pretty impressive.

306
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:46,791
Well...

307
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,166
He must have really liked you.

308
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:50,958
You realize if you
partnered up with him,

309
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:52,916
the other merchants
wouldn't stand a chance

310
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,625
against the two you.

311
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,708
Possibly, but that wasn't
what our visit was about.

312
00:18:57,791 --> 00:18:59,500
I see.

313
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:01,458
That makes sense.

314
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,375
He is far too committed to
that dilapidated mansion of his.

315
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:07,291
I assume you saw the garden.

316
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:10,250
I did, and it
was equally impressive.

317
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:12,416
Those glass windows were huge...

318
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:14,625
I've never seen
panes that big before.

319
00:19:14,708 --> 00:19:16,750
I don't know how he stands them.

320
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:20,958
They would drive me crazy.

321
00:19:21,041 --> 00:19:23,916
Well?

322
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,666
Well apparently
they came to some sort

323
00:19:25,750 --> 00:19:27,291
of conclusion
at the meeting.

324
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:28,916
What did they conclude?

325
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,166
Actually, I didn't even ask.

326
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,875
And you did you
manage to find out?

327
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,625
Did I?

328
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,833
That guy doesn't
tell me anything...

329
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:49,083
But it would certainly
be nice to know what happened.

330
00:19:49,166 --> 00:19:52,500
Especially if we were able
hear it directly from him.

331
00:19:52,583 --> 00:19:55,333
I can appreciate why
you would feel that way.

332
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:58,166
I'm afraid I'm interested
in something else, though.

333
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,708
What do you really want?

334
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,458
I'm sure you have
some other motive

335
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:06,250
beyond using me to find out
what happened at a meeting.

336
00:20:06,333 --> 00:20:08,958
You get right to
the point, don't you?

337
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,750
Didn't you come here to
do a little bargaining...

338
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,250
Take care of some
business, something like that?

339
00:20:15,333 --> 00:20:17,416
I'm just like everyone else.

340
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:19,541
I'm trying to make
as big of a profit

341
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,708
as possible off this thing.

342
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:24,166
What else would
I want besides that?

343
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,625
Perhaps avoid
a devastating loss?

344
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:32,625
I wish people
had only one eye...

345
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:35,208
It's hard to watch
2 at the same time.

346
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:36,666
You're right.

347
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,666
I'm trying to keep a loss
from happening as well.

348
00:20:38,750 --> 00:20:42,125
Meaning what?

349
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:47,625
I've been doing some
trading with stone statues.

350
00:20:47,708 --> 00:20:49,375
You mean the Holy Mother.

351
00:20:49,458 --> 00:20:51,000
You saw one.

352
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:53,208
Unfortunately,
I'm just dragging stone.

353
00:20:53,291 --> 00:20:55,958
The profit margins aren't all
they could be at the moment.

354
00:20:56,041 --> 00:20:58,208
That won't change
unless the church approves

355
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:00,333
an indulgence for
praying with the statue.

356
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,750
A considerable number
of people buy them already

357
00:21:02,833 --> 00:21:05,083
thanks to the Northern
Expedition every year.

358
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:07,875
Another reason religious
belief is a blessing.

359
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:09,208
True.

360
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:10,916
Although I can't
exactly make a profit

361
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,500
from a blessing, now can I?

362
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,250
At least for
a time I was selling

363
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:16,000
a decent amount of statues.

364
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,708
And then they suddenly
decided to cut me off.

365
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,958
Now I realize
no one will turn their back

366
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,625
on you faster
than the church.

367
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,916
I heard their
authority in the south

368
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,541
has been rapidly deteriorating
over the past months.

369
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:34,708
I saw that I and
my goods were going

370
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,625
down with a sinking ship...

371
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,666
and I knew I couldn't
let that happen.

372
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,125
So I thought
I could make a decent

373
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:42,875
profit and move
somewhere else.

374
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,541
Naturally.

375
00:21:44,625 --> 00:21:47,166
If I can make enough coin
off of what's going on here,

376
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,041
I'll be able to head south
and forget about the church.

377
00:21:55,083 --> 00:21:58,041
Might be time for me to go
on a pilgrimage myself.

378
00:22:01,875 --> 00:22:03,875
With that being said...

379
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:08,041
I don't suppose you
would lend me some money.

380
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:11,333
You see, I get to
the point quickly as well.

381
00:22:11,416 --> 00:22:14,166
Would you consider
selling your companion?

382
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:11,708
