AND IF SOMEONE WERE TO DESTROY

321
00:10:44,907 --> 00:10:46,943

343
00:11:22,413 --> 00:11:26,317
>> YEAH, YOU’RE RIGHT.

344
00:11:26,317 --> 00:11:27,218
HEY, SHINRA...

345
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:31,489
>> WHAT IS IT?

346
00:11:31,489 --> 00:11:33,324
>> I NEED TO HIT YOU.

347
00:11:33,324 --> 00:11:38,397
>> DO IT!

348
00:11:38,397 --> 00:11:39,931
ALL RIGHT, NOW I GET TO HIT

349
00:11:39,931 --> 00:11:42,201

350
00:11:52,277 --> 00:11:52,978
>> UH.

351
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:53,846
>> PERFECT.

352
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,847
YOU’RE PRETTIEST WHEN YOU’RE

353
00:11:54,847 --> 00:11:58,517
NOT HIDING YOUR FACE, YOU KNOW.

354
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:00,185
THAT PUNCH WAS A KISS...TO

355
00:12:00,185 --> 00:12:01,521
CELEBRATE OUR MARRIAGE.

356
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:03,456
OKAY?

357
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,857
OW.

358
00:12:04,857 --> 00:12:07,159
[groans]

359
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,568
ARE YOU CRYING?

360
00:12:29,315 --> 00:12:31,552
>> THAT WAS QUITE ASTOUNDING.

361
00:12:31,552 --> 00:12:33,219
MM?

362
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,557
>> [mutters]

363
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,124
>> YO, IZAYA.

364
00:12:38,124 --> 00:12:40,127
>> DOTACHIN. BEEN AWHILE.

365
00:12:40,127 --> 00:12:41,528
>> WILL YA STOP CALLIN’ ME THAT?

366
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,596
>> YEAH, ANYWAYS DO YOU KNOW

367
00:12:42,596 --> 00:12:43,897
WHERE THE NAME THE DOLLARS COMES

368
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,299
FROM?

369
00:12:45,299 --> 00:12:46,300
>> ISN’T IT SOMETHIN’ LIKE,

370
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:47,668
"GIMME ALL YOUR DOLLARS"?

371
00:12:47,668 --> 00:12:49,904
>> NO, NOT EVEN CLOSE.

372
00:12:49,904 --> 00:12:50,571
IT COMES FROM THE FACT THAT

373
00:12:50,571 --> 00:12:51,906
THEY DON’T DO ANYTHING.

374
00:12:51,906 --> 00:12:54,141
THEY JUST DAWDLE AROUND ALL DAY.

375
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,010
BUT "DOLLARS" SOUNDS COOLER.

376
00:12:56,010 --> 00:12:57,612
>> DOTACHIN, TELL ME YOU SAW IT

377
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:58,279
TOO!

378
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,346
THE BLACK RIDER!

379
00:12:59,346 --> 00:13:00,347
>> I TOTALLY CAN’T BELIEVE THAT

380
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:01,416
JUST HAPPENED.

381
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:02,417
I DIDN’T HALLUCINATE ALL THAT

382
00:13:02,417 --> 00:13:03,551
CRAZINESS, DID I?

383
00:13:03,551 --> 00:13:05,387
IT WAS LIKE A CG CHARACTER OR

384
00:13:05,387 --> 00:13:06,120
SOMETHING.

385
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:07,455
>> THAT CG CHARACTER IS ALSO

386
00:13:07,455 --> 00:13:08,923
PART OF THE DOLLARS.

387
00:13:08,923 --> 00:13:10,392
>> both: WHAT? WOW!

388
00:13:10,392 --> 00:13:11,193
>> IS THAT TRUE?

389
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:12,027
>> both: THAT IS SO COOL!

390
00:13:12,027 --> 00:13:14,589
SO COOL. SO COOL.

391
00:13:18,033 --> 00:13:19,334
>> I’M A LITTLE SHOCKED BY ALL

392
00:13:19,334 --> 00:13:20,502
THIS.

393
00:13:20,502 --> 00:13:21,436
I KNEW THERE WERE A LOT OF

394
00:13:21,436 --> 00:13:22,570
PEOPLE ONLINE CLAIMING THAT

395
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:23,572
THEY WERE MEMBERS OF THE

396
00:13:23,572 --> 00:13:24,707
DOLLARS.

397
00:13:24,707 --> 00:13:26,374
HOWEVER, I HAD NO IDEA SO MANY

398
00:13:26,374 --> 00:13:27,943
OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE AN

399
00:13:27,943 --> 00:13:28,644
EFFORT TO TURN UP WHEN A

400
00:13:28,644 --> 00:13:30,579
MEETING WAS FINALLY CALLED.

401
00:13:30,579 --> 00:13:31,580
[laughs]

402
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:33,949
HUMAN BEINGS DEFY IMAGINATION.

403
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:35,584
REMEMBER, I KNOW YOU CAME HERE

404
00:13:35,584 --> 00:13:37,420
TO TOKYO HOPING TO ESCAPE THE

405
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,455
HUMDRUM, BUT IN ABOUT SIX

406
00:13:39,455 --> 00:13:41,024
MONTHS, THIS’LL ALL SEEM

407
00:13:41,024 --> 00:13:42,591
PRETTY ORDINARY TO YOU.

408
00:13:42,591 --> 00:13:44,293
AT THAT RATE, YOU’LL HAVE TO

409
00:13:44,293 --> 00:13:45,561
MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTRY TO KEEP

410
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:46,730
THINGS EXCITING OR START

411
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:47,663
LOOKING FOR THINGS THAT ARE A

412
00:13:47,663 --> 00:13:50,466
LITTLE MORE UNDERGROUND.

413
00:13:50,466 --> 00:13:51,635
BUT I’D BE WILLING TO BET THAT

414
00:13:51,635 --> 00:13:54,203
YOU WOULD GET BORED OF THAT IN

415
00:13:54,203 --> 00:13:55,705
JUST A FEW DAYS AS WELL.

416

CONSTANTLY BE EVOLVING.

OR AIM LOW...

422
00:14:06,616 --> 00:14:08,752
ENJOY EACH DAY FOR WHAT IT IS.

423
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:12,189
NOW, AS A SIGN OF RESPECT, I’VE

424
00:14:12,189 --> 00:14:13,758
DECIDED NOT TO CHARGE YOU FOR

YESTERDAY!

452
00:15:08,114 --> 00:15:09,181
THEY’RE SAYING IT WAS OFF THE

00:15:13,319 --> 00:15:14,787
AND IT IS HEADLESS.

457
00:15:14,787 --> 00:15:16,155
IT, LIKE, RODE DOWN WALLS.

458
00:15:16,155 --> 00:15:17,289
AND IT HAS THIS SCYTHE, WHICH

459
00:15:17,289 --> 00:15:18,825
IT WAS TOTALLY SWINGING AROUND

460

ALL CRAZY LIKE!

461

>> AND EVEN FOR THOSE TWO.

464
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:25,798
>> I DON’T HAVE ANY LOVE FOR

465
00:15:25,798 --> 00:15:27,767
YOU AT ALL.

466
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,769
BUT WHENEVER I SEE YOUR FACE,

467
00:15:29,769 --> 00:15:31,838
I’M REMINDED OF THE PASSION

468
00:15:31,838 --> 00:15:33,773
AND LOVE I HAVE FOR HER.

469
00:15:33,773 --> 00:15:34,741
SO WITH THAT IN MIND, I’LL

THEY SAID IT’S KINDA URGENT.

493
00:16:19,888 --> 00:16:21,223
>> THAT’S FINE.

494
00:16:21,223 --> 00:16:23,358
MY LIFE, IT WENT BACK TO

495
00:16:23,358 --> 00:16:25,394
NORMAL AS WELL.

496
00:16:25,394 --> 00:16:26,561
RUNNING ACROSS PEOPLE I’D

497
00:16:26,561 --> 00:16:28,730
RATHER NOT MEET, JUST LIKE IT

498
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:30,833
WAS ANY OTHER DAY.

499
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:31,801
>> IT LOOKS LIKE YOU’VE MOVED

500
00:16:31,801 --> 00:16:32,902
ON.

501
00:16:32,902 --> 00:16:34,136
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF

502
00:16:34,136 --> 00:16:35,337
SPOOKY THINGS ’CAUSE THEY TEND

503
00:16:35,337 --> 00:16:36,205
TO LURK IN THE DARK AND THEN

504
00:16:36,205 --> 00:16:37,773
JUMP OUT AT YOU.

505
00:16:37,773 --> 00:16:39,441
AFTER THAT LITTLE ENTRANCE YOU

506
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:41,677
MADE, I DOUBT ANYONE’S GONNA

507
00:16:41,677 --> 00:16:43,345
BE SCARED OF YOU ANYMORE.

508
00:16:43,345 --> 00:16:44,614

512
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:49,185
I’M GUESSING YOU’RE GONNA GO

513
00:16:49,185 --> 00:16:50,686
AFTER THAT WOMAN NOW.

514
00:16:50,686 --> 00:16:51,721
I WOULD BE GLAD TO HELP YOU OUT

515
00:16:51,721 --> 00:16:53,156
WITH THAT.

516
00:16:53,156 --> 00:16:56,626
JUST CALL ME.

517
00:16:56,626 --> 00:16:58,261
BYE NOW.

518
00:16:58,261 --> 00:16:59,262
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHERE

519
00:16:59,262 --> 00:17:01,231
NAMIE YAGIRI WENT.

520
00:17:01,231 --> 00:17:03,767
BUT I DON’T CARE. I’M ME...

521
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,602
AND THAT’S ENOUGH.

522
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:06,637
MY DAYS WERE ALWAYS PRETTY

523
00:17:06,637 --> 00:17:08,705
UNCOMPLICATED, NOT TOO FULL OF

524
00:17:08,705 --> 00:17:10,206
HOPE OR DESPAIR.

525
00:17:10,206 --> 00:17:11,842
AND THEY’RE STILL LIKE THAT.

526
00:17:11,842 --> 00:17:14,177
IT’S JUST THAT NOW I FIND THEM

527
00:17:14,177 --> 00:17:16,713
INCREDIBLY SATISFYING.

528
00:17:16,713 --> 00:17:20,217
HERE I AM, AND THERE YOU ARE.

529
00:17:20,217 --> 00:17:21,218
IF YOU CAN FIND REDEMPTION IN

530
00:17:21,218 --> 00:17:22,853
ME, THEN I CAN DO THE SAME

531
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:28,592
WITH YOU.

532
00:17:28,592 --> 00:17:29,727
AND THE YOUNG BOY IS STILL

533
00:17:29,727 --> 00:17:31,428
PONDERING HIS CONVERSATION WITH

534
00:17:31,428 --> 00:17:33,798
IZAYA ORIHARA.

535
00:17:33,798 --> 00:17:34,899
CAN A PERSON TRULY HAVE A LIFE

536
00:17:34,899 --> 00:17:37,301
THAT’S ALWAYS NEW, ALWAYS FULL

537
00:17:37,301 --> 00:17:39,904
OF EXCITEMENT AND POSSIBILITY?

538
00:17:39,904 --> 00:17:40,905
OR IS IT JUST A MATTER OF TIME

539
00:17:40,905 --> 00:17:43,608
BEFORE THAT TOO BECOMES PART OF

540
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,643
THE EVERYDAY?

541
00:17:45,643 --> 00:17:46,711
>> HEY, I’M SORRY FOR

542
00:17:46,711 --> 00:17:47,445
EVERYTHING.

543
00:17:47,445 --> 00:17:48,446
>> AND THANK YOU.

544
00:17:48,446 --> 00:17:50,916
>> [mutters]

545
00:17:55,487 --> 00:17:55,954
>> WAIT A SEC.

546
00:17:55,954 --> 00:17:57,690
THAT’S MY SEAT!

547
00:17:57,690 --> 00:17:58,724
>> WELL, THERE’S A SPOT OPEN

548
00:17:58,724 --> 00:18:00,392
BEHIND THE CLASS REP.

549
00:18:00,392 --> 00:18:01,293
>> HUH?

550
00:18:01,293 --> 00:18:02,928
WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

551
00:18:02,928 --> 00:18:04,530
YOU CAN’T JUST SHOW UP AND TAKE

552
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:09,902
SOMEBODY’S SEAT.

553
00:18:09,902 --> 00:18:11,870
>> AS FOR HER, CHANCES ARE SHE

554
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:12,971
WON’T BE SPENDING MUCH TIME

555
00:18:12,971 --> 00:18:15,241
WITH MIKA HARIMA ANYMORE.

556
00:18:15,241 --> 00:18:17,243
AND IN THE END, ONLY SHE WILL

557
00:18:17,243 --> 00:18:18,011
KNOW IF THAT’S THE RIGHT

558
00:18:18,011 --> 00:18:19,745
DECISION.

559
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:21,981
BUT THEN, MAYBE SHE WON’T.

560
00:18:21,981 --> 00:18:23,316
IT’S RARE FOR A PERSON TO TRULY

561
00:18:23,316 --> 00:18:25,852
UNDERSTAND THEIR OWN HEART.

562
00:18:25,852 --> 00:18:27,520
AS SOMEONE ONCE SAID, THE

563
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:29,789
BEST THING YOU CAN DO IS KEEP

564
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:32,025
EVOLVING.

565
00:18:32,025 --> 00:18:33,326
HE WAS EMPOWERED BY HIS

566
00:18:33,326 --> 00:18:35,529
PREVIOUS ACTIONS, SO HE THOUGHT

567
00:18:35,529 --> 00:18:36,996
HE COULD DO ANYTHING NOW.

568
00:18:36,996 --> 00:18:38,765
BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, WHAT THE

569
00:18:38,765 --> 00:18:39,933
YOUNG BOY HAD FAILED TO ACCOUNT

570
00:18:39,933 --> 00:18:42,336
FOR WAS THE SHEER AMOUNT OF

571
00:18:42,336 --> 00:18:43,937
COURAGE IT WOULD TAKE IN ORDER

572
00:18:43,937 --> 00:18:45,272
FOR HIM TO ASK OUT HIS

573
00:18:45,272 --> 00:18:47,007
CLASSMATE.

574
00:18:47,007 --> 00:18:50,945
[breathes deeply]

575
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,813
IN 30 SECONDS, THE BOY WILL

576
00:18:52,813 --> 00:18:54,448
FIND THE GIRL.

577
00:18:54,448 --> 00:18:56,651
IN 35 SECONDS, THE BOY WILL

578
00:18:56,651 --> 00:18:57,785
DISCOVER HIS BEST FRIEND

579
00:18:57,785 --> 00:18:59,820
HITTING ON THE GIRL.

580
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,489
IN 45 SECONDS, THE BOY WILL

581
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:04,292
KICK THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

582
00:19:04,292 --> 00:19:05,993
IN 74 SECONDS, THE GIRL WILL

583
00:19:05,993 --> 00:19:07,528
REJECT THE BOY’S OFFER TO GET

584
00:19:07,528 --> 00:19:08,363
COFFEE.

585
00:19:08,363 --> 00:19:10,631
AND, IN 78 SECONDS, THAT GIRL

586
00:19:10,631 --> 00:19:11,832
WILL ASK THE BOY TO HAVE LUNCH

587
00:19:11,832 --> 00:19:14,069
WITH HER ON THE ROOF.

588
00:19:14,069 --> 00:19:15,503
HOW LONG WILL IT TAKE FOR HIM

589
00:19:15,503 --> 00:19:17,538
TO FALL IN LOVE WITH HER?

590
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:19,074
AND HOW LONG BEFORE HE WORKS UP

591
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:21,910
THE NERVE TO TELL HER?

592
00:19:21,910 --> 00:19:23,612
>> [laughs]

593
00:19:27,415 --> 00:19:28,784
>> I GOTTA SAY...

594
00:19:28,784 --> 00:19:32,988
THAT WAS VERY FOOLISH OF YOU.

595
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,790
YOU THREW AWAY EVERYTHING FOR

596
00:19:34,790 --> 00:19:35,924
YOUR BROTHER’S TWISTED

597
00:19:35,924 --> 00:19:38,394
VERSION OF LOVE.

598
00:19:42,999 --> 00:19:46,668
[splash]

599
00:19:46,668 --> 00:19:48,838
OR MAYBE IT WAS YOUR TWISTED

600
00:19:48,838 --> 00:19:50,539
LOVE FOR YOUR BROTHER.

601
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:52,742
SO THIS CAN’T LOOK GOOD, CAN IT?

602
00:19:52,742 --> 00:19:53,910
YOU’RE ABOUT TO MERGE WITH THE

603
00:19:53,910 --> 00:19:54,911
NEBRA PEOPLE.

604
00:19:54,911 --> 00:19:56,045
LET THEM CATCH WIND OF

605
00:19:56,045 --> 00:19:57,647
SOMETHING LIKE THIS, AND, THE

606
00:19:57,647 --> 00:19:58,948
NEXT THING YOU KNOW, YOU’VE GOT

607
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:01,518
SOME MAFIA HIT-MAN ON YOUR TAIL.

608
00:20:01,518 --> 00:20:03,019
THEN AFTER THAT, POW!

609
00:20:03,019 --> 00:20:04,854
AND CHECKMATE.

610
00:20:04,854 --> 00:20:06,556
CLEANING CREW?

611
00:20:06,556 --> 00:20:07,124
>> THAT’S THEM.

612
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:09,026
THAT’S THE NORMAL CREW THEY USE.

613
00:20:09,026 --> 00:20:11,428
>> GOT IT.

614
00:20:11,428 --> 00:20:13,797
[ringing]

615
00:20:13,797 --> 00:20:14,531
HELLO.

616
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:15,398
THINGS ARE GETTING A LITTLE

617
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,967
BIT HEATED IN YOUR NECK OF THE

618
00:20:16,967 --> 00:20:17,735
WOODS.

619
00:20:17,735 --> 00:20:18,702
YOU SHOULD GET OUT OF THERE

620
00:20:18,702 --> 00:20:22,372
SOON.

621
00:20:22,372 --> 00:20:23,807
I WISH THE KING PIECES COULD

622
00:20:23,807 --> 00:20:25,409
FIGHT EACH OTHER.

623
00:20:25,409 --> 00:20:27,911
THEY SHOULD CHANGE THAT RULE.

624
00:20:27,911 --> 00:20:28,879
I’VE GOTTA THINK THAT YOUR

625
00:20:28,879 --> 00:20:31,081
UNCLE WAS A LOT LIKE ME.

626
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:32,783
HE QUESTIONED THE AFTERLIFE

627
00:20:32,783 --> 00:20:34,017
MORE THAN ANYONE...

628
00:20:34,017 --> 00:20:36,120
FEARED DEATH MORE THAN ANYONE...

629
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,155
AND LONGED FOR HEAVEN MORE THAN

630
00:20:37,155 --> 00:20:38,756
ANYONE.

631
00:20:38,756 --> 00:20:40,758
BUT THE AFTERLIFE, WELL, THAT I

632
00:20:40,758 --> 00:20:42,126
BELIEVE IN

633
00:20:42,126 --> 00:20:44,863
WE’LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.

634
00:20:44,863 --> 00:20:46,497
FOR WHATEVER REASON, DULLAHANS

635
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:47,899
ARE ALWAYS DEPICTED AS WOMEN IN

636
00:20:47,899 --> 00:20:49,133
THE LEGENDS.

637
00:20:49,133 --> 00:20:51,002
DO YOU KNOW WHY THAT IS?

638
00:20:51,002 --> 00:20:52,003
>> NO, I DON’T.

639
00:20:52,003 --> 00:20:53,472
MY MEN DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON

640
00:20:53,472 --> 00:20:54,839
THE MYTH, BUT, IN THE END, I

641
00:20:54,839 --> 00:20:56,841
THOUGHT IT WAS A WASTE OF TIME.

642
00:20:56,841 --> 00:20:58,009
>> YOU’RE ALWAYS THE PRAGMATIC

643
00:20:58,009 --> 00:20:58,910
ONE.

644
00:20:58,910 --> 00:21:00,979
WELL, SUIT YOURSELF.

645
00:21:00,979 --> 00:21:02,847
THERE’S A PLACE CALLED VALHALLA.

646
00:21:02,847 --> 00:21:04,950
IT’S SORT LIKE A HEAVEN.

647
00:21:04,950 --> 00:21:05,750
AND, ACCORDING TO NORDIC

648
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,853
MYTHOLOGY, THE SOUL OF A FALLEN

649
00:21:07,853 --> 00:21:09,121
WARRIOR IS GUIDED TO VALHALLA

650
00:21:09,121 --> 00:21:10,589
BY AN ARMORED, FEMALE ANGEL

651
00:21:10,589 --> 00:21:12,892
KNOWN AS A VALKYRIE.

652
00:21:12,892 --> 00:21:14,594
A WOMAN WHO COMES TO GREET THE

653
00:21:14,594 --> 00:21:15,160
DEAD.

654
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:18,030
DOESN’T THAT SOUND FAMILIAR?

655
00:21:18,030 --> 00:21:19,599
SOME THEORIZE THAT A DULLAHAN

656
00:21:19,599 --> 00:21:20,933
IS ACTUALLY A VALKYRIE WHO IS

657
00:21:20,933 --> 00:21:22,902
WANDERING AROUND ON EARTH.

658
00:21:22,902 --> 00:21:25,505
AND, IF THAT’S TRUE, THEN THIS

659
00:21:25,505 --> 00:21:27,573
HEAD IS PROBABLY WAITING...

660
00:21:27,573 --> 00:21:29,775
WAITING TO WAKE UP FOR WAR.

661
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:31,044
THEN SHE CAN FIND HER WARRIOR

662
00:21:31,044 --> 00:21:33,179
AND TAKE HIM TO VALHALLA.

663
00:21:33,179 --> 00:21:34,948
THAT’S WHY SHE’S ALIVE, BUT WITH

664
00:21:34,948 --> 00:21:36,116
HER EYES CLOSED, BECAUSE WE

665
00:21:36,116 --> 00:21:37,984
AREN’T ON A BATTLEFIELD.

666
00:21:37,984 --> 00:21:40,020
IT’S MY WISH THAT SHE WOULD

667
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:42,155
CHOOSE ME AS HER WARRIOR.

668
00:21:42,155 --> 00:21:43,690
IF THERE TRULY IS A VALHALLA

669
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,091
AWAITING ME AFTER DEATH, HOW

670
00:21:45,091 --> 00:21:47,027
DO I EVEN PREPARE FOR THIS?

671
00:21:47,027 --> 00:21:48,094
I MEAN, I KNOW I’M NOT REALLY

672
00:21:48,094 --> 00:21:50,230
CUT OUT FOR BATTLEFIELD HEROICS.

673
00:21:50,230 --> 00:21:51,865
SO THEN I’LL HAVE TO START A

674
00:21:51,865 --> 00:21:54,968
WAR THAT ONLY I CAN WIN, RIGHT?

675
00:21:54,968 --> 00:21:55,969
[laughs]

676
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,638
AREN’T I THE LUCKY ONE?

677
00:21:57,638 --> 00:21:58,972
IMAGINE ME, WHO DOESN’T BELIEVE

678
00:21:58,972 --> 00:22:00,074
IN A HEAVEN, MUCH LESS A

679
00:22:00,074 --> 00:22:01,842
VIRTUOUS LIFE.

680
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,510
AND YET I STILL MEET AN ANGEL

681
00:22:03,510 --> 00:22:05,012
OF DEATH WHO’S FALLEN TO EARTH.

682
00:22:05,012 --> 00:22:06,213
>> WHATEVER.

683
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:08,215
THAT’S SIMPLY A THEORY OF YOURS.

684

>> WHOSOEVER BELIEVETH WILL BE

685
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:10,618
SAVED.

686
00:22:10,618 --> 00:22:13,087
THIS IS JUST INSURANCE REALLY.

687
00:22:13,087 --> 00:22:14,656
EVEN IF I DO END UP IN A HELL

688
00:22:14,656 --> 00:22:16,858
SURROUNDED BY PAIN, AS LONG AS

689
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,594
I COULD EXIST, I WOULDN’T CARE.

690
00:22:19,594 --> 00:22:21,963
BUT, THAT SAID, IF IT IS AT ALL

691
00:22:21,963 --> 00:22:23,498
POSSIBLE, I WOULD STILL PREFER

692
00:22:23,498 --> 00:22:24,499
HEAVEN.

693
00:22:24,499 --> 00:22:25,833
HEY, NAMIE.

694
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:28,937
WHY DON’T WE ALL GO TO HEAVEN?

695
00:22:28,937 --> 00:22:30,572
AS A MEMBER OF THE DOLLARS, I’M

696
00:22:30,572 --> 00:22:32,540
GONNA KEEP THIS HIDING IN PLAIN

697
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,776
SIGHT.

698
00:22:33,776 --> 00:22:35,010
THE LAST PLACE CELTY IS GOING

699
00:22:35,010 --> 00:22:36,278
TO LOOK FOR HER HEAD IS WITHIN

700
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:37,980
THE SAME GANG THAT SHE BELONGS

701
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:39,147
TO.

702
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:40,048
I KNOW!

703
00:22:40,048 --> 00:22:41,249
YOU SHOULD BECOME PART OF THE

704
00:22:41,249 --> 00:22:42,551
DOLLARS TOO.

705
00:22:42,551 --> 00:22:44,019
IT’S A LITTLE KNOWN FACT THAT

706
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,120
OUR BOSS DOESN’T TURN DOWN

707
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,221
ANYONE.

708
00:22:46,221 --> 00:22:48,624
OF COURSE, AFTER A WHILE, I WAS

709
00:22:48,624 --> 00:22:50,025
THE ONE WHO WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN

710
00:22:50,025 --> 00:22:51,960
GATHERING PEOPLE.

711
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,130
I SAY WE GIVE THIS FALLEN ANGEL

712
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,133
A PAIR OF WINGS AGAIN.

713
