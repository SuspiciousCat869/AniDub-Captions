00:15:06,758 --> 00:15:07,925
GUY FRIENDS.

411
00:15:07,925 --> 00:15:10,194
ACTUALLY, THIS IS PROBABLY

412
00:15:10,194 --> 00:15:11,762
THE FIRST TIME THAT SHE’S TRULY

413
00:15:11,762 --> 00:15:13,229
BEEN FRIENDS WITH ANYONE.

414

ATTRACTIVE ONE IN THE GROUP.

422
00:15:22,737 --> 00:15:24,773
AND SHE WAS FINE WITH THAT.

423
00:15:24,773 --> 00:15:26,608
SHE KNEW WHAT ROLE TO PLAY

424
00:15:26,608 --> 00:15:27,709
WITH HER.

425
00:15:27,709 --> 00:15:30,878
BUT NOW, AFTER LOSING THAT, SHE

426
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:32,946
ISN’T EXACTLY SURE WHAT ROLE

427
00:15:32,946 --> 00:15:34,815
SHE SHOULD PLAY.

428
00:15:34,815 --> 00:15:36,383
>> OKAY!

I JUST WANNA USE YOU AS BAIT

436
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:47,559
SO WHEN OTHER CHICKS SEE US,

437
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,794
THEY THINK, "WELL IF THAT GIRL’S

438

00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,728
HE NEEDS A SERIOUS HANDICAP.
