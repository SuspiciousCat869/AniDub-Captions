SEE, I TOO DEEPLY LOVE PEOPLE.

343
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:15,107
AND I WILL NOT LET THEM BE

344
00:13:15,107 --> 00:13:17,175
TAKEN BY A STUPID SWORD.

345
00:13:17,175 --> 00:13:19,877
HUMANS ARE MINE, AND I REALLY

346
00:13:19,877 --> 00:13:22,512
DON’T LIKE TO SHARE.

347
00:13:22,512 --> 00:13:24,113
OH, BUT THAT SAID, I DON’T

348
00:13:24,113 --> 00:13:25,314
NEED SHIZU-CHAN.

349
00:13:25,314 --> 00:13:26,382
HE’S ALL YOURS.

350
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:28,116
I HOPE YOU SLICE HIM TO PIECES

351
00:13:28,116 --> 00:13:29,251
IMMEDIATELY.

352
00:13:29,251 --> 00:13:31,353
I MEAN, WHY WAIT?

353
00:13:31,353 --> 00:13:32,353
BEST OF LUCK!

354
00:13:32,353 --> 00:13:35,489
SEE YA!

355
00:13:44,362 --> 00:13:46,330
>> YOU’RE BACK LATE.

356
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:48,131
LOOK AT YOUR FACE!

357
00:13:48,131 --> 00:13:50,633
WHAT HAPPENED?

358
00:13:50,633 --> 00:13:52,001
>> I WAS HIT WITH A RATHER

359
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,202
HARD PUNCH.

360
00:13:53,202 --> 00:13:55,203
[hums]

361
00:13:55,203 --> 00:13:56,304
>> HEY.

362
00:13:56,304 --> 00:13:58,606
>> HUH?

363
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:00,007
SIMON?

364
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,441
>> HMM.

365
00:14:01,441 --> 00:14:05,378
>> [shouts, grunts]

366
00:14:10,147 --> 00:14:12,183
>> [speaking Russian]

367
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:17,186
[laughs]

368
00:14:17,186 --> 00:14:19,221
>> [speaking Russian]

369
00:15:04,988 --> 00:15:06,122
[laughs]

370
00:15:14,261 --> 00:15:16,530
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU’RE SPEAKING

371
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,731
IN RUSSIAN, YOU ARE SO NOT THE

372
00:15:17,731 --> 00:15:19,165
SAME GUY.

373
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:22,367
OH, HEY, I’VE GOT A QUESTION.

374
00:15:22,367 --> 00:15:23,401
>> WHAT?

375
00:15:23,401 --> 00:15:24,969
>> IT SEEMS THAT SOMEONE TOLD

376
00:15:24,969 --> 00:15:26,337
HORADA ABOUT MIKADO.

377
00:15:26,337 --> 00:15:28,039
WAS IT YOU?

378
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:29,172
>> DON’T KNOW, MAYBE.

379
00:15:29,172 --> 00:15:31,241
>> OOH, SCARY.

380
00:15:31,241 --> 00:15:33,342
SO, YOU’RE STILL UPSET.

381
00:15:33,342 --> 00:15:35,244
HONESTLY, SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST

382
00:15:35,244 --> 00:15:37,311
SO INCREDIBLY PREDICTABLE.

383
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,312
AND THEN THERE’S SIMON AND

384
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:40,180
SHIZU-CHAN, WHO NEVER DO WHAT

385
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:41,481
YOU EXPECT.

386
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,150
AND THAT RIGHT THERE IS EXACTLY

387
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,017
WHY I LOVE THE HUMAN RACE SO

388
00:15:45,017 --> 00:15:45,985
MUCH.

389
00:15:45,985 --> 00:15:47,319
THERE YOU HAVE IT.

390
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:48,987
IT’S ALSO THE VERY REASON WHY

391
00:15:48,987 --> 00:15:50,188
I CAN KEEP DOING THIS FREAKIN’

392
00:15:50,188 --> 00:15:51,989
JOB FOREVER.

393
00:15:51,989 --> 00:15:53,690
IT’S SO FUN, IT MAKES ME WANT

394
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:54,658
TO PUKE.

395
00:15:54,658 --> 00:15:55,592
>> I KNOW I’VE SAID THIS

396
00:15:55,592 --> 00:15:57,593
BEFORE, BUT I THINK THAT THE

397
00:15:57,593 --> 00:15:59,161
ENTIRE HUMAN RACE PRETTY MUCH

398
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:00,663
HATES YOUR GUTS.

399
00:16:00,663 --> 00:16:02,597
>> MAYBE YOU’RE RIGHT.

400
00:16:02,597 --> 00:16:06,600
[laughing]

401
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:11,704
>> SAKI.

402
00:16:11,704 --> 00:16:13,238
>> I KNEW IT.

403
00:16:13,238 --> 00:16:15,139
TRUTH IS, YOU NEVER EVEN

404
00:16:15,139 --> 00:16:17,075
SHOWED UP THAT DAY.

405
00:16:17,075 --> 00:16:17,608
>> OH!

406
00:16:17,608 --> 00:16:19,142
>> INSTEAD, YOU SPENT THE WHOLE

407
00:16:19,142 --> 00:16:20,310
TIME TRYING TO GET A HOLD OF

408
00:16:20,310 --> 00:16:21,744
IZAYA.

409
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:24,113
YOU CALLED HIM AGAIN AND AGAIN.

410
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:25,414
WHEN I SAW HIM, HE SHOWED ME

411
00:16:25,414 --> 00:16:27,148
HIS CALL HISTORY AND HE JUST

412
00:16:27,148 --> 00:16:27,615
LAUGHED.

413
00:16:27,615 --> 00:16:28,516
>> [sighs]

414
00:16:28,516 --> 00:16:29,750
>> BUT YOU SHOULDN’T WORRY ABOUT

415
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,585
IT.

416
00:16:30,585 --> 00:16:32,252
EVEN IF YOU GOT THERE LATE...

417
00:16:32,252 --> 00:16:33,553
IT REALLY WOULDN’T HAVE MADE A

418
00:16:33,553 --> 00:16:34,688
BIG DIFFERENCE TO ME.

419
00:16:34,688 --> 00:16:35,754
>> DON’T SAY THAT.

420
00:16:35,754 --> 00:16:36,555
>> IT’S TRUE.

421
00:16:36,555 --> 00:16:37,523
IN FACT I THINK IT’S FOR THE

422
00:16:37,523 --> 00:16:38,423
BEST.

423
00:16:38,423 --> 00:16:39,591
YOU DIDN’T SHOW UP AND GET HURT

424
00:16:39,591 --> 00:16:40,258
THAT--

425
00:16:40,258 --> 00:16:43,194
>> LET’S SPLIT UP!

426
00:16:43,194 --> 00:16:44,195
END THIS THING.

427
00:16:46,262 --> 00:16:48,598
[gasps]

428
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:51,366
I AM SUCH A LOSER.

429
00:16:51,366 --> 00:16:53,702
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY SAKI WANTED

430
00:16:53,702 --> 00:16:54,702
TO BE WITH ME IN THE FIRST

431
00:16:54,702 --> 00:16:55,469
PLACE.

432
00:16:55,469 --> 00:16:56,604
>> IT’S ’CAUSE YOU’RE STRANGELY

433
00:16:56,604 --> 00:16:58,471
HONEST LIKE THAT.

434
00:16:58,471 --> 00:17:00,306
>> HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN HERE?

435
00:17:00,306 --> 00:17:01,240
>> A BIT.

436
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:02,541
ERIKA AND THE OTHERS TOLD ME

437
00:17:02,541 --> 00:17:03,609
WHAT HAPPENED.

438
00:17:03,609 --> 00:17:04,776
ALL OF IT.

439
00:17:04,776 --> 00:17:06,244
GUESS WHAT?

440
00:17:06,244 --> 00:17:08,078
YOU’RE A REALLY BIG IDIOT, YOU

441
00:17:08,078 --> 00:17:09,246
KNOW?

442
00:17:09,246 --> 00:17:10,280
>> YOU’RE JUST NOW NOTICING

443
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:11,247
THAT?

444
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:13,549
>> LOOK, I NEED TO APOLOGIZE TO

445
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:14,583
YOU FOR SOMETHING.

446
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,484
>> WHA?

447
00:17:15,484 --> 00:17:17,319
>> THEY REALLY DIDN’T KIDNAP ME.

448
00:17:17,319 --> 00:17:19,353
I KINDA LET THEM CATCH ME.

449
00:17:19,353 --> 00:17:21,222
IZAYA TOLD ME IF I DID THAT,

450
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:24,157
THEN EVERYTHING WOULD END.

451
00:17:24,157 --> 00:17:25,358
SO THAT’S WHAT I DID.

452
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:28,060
THAT NIGHT, I WENT THERE ALONE

453
00:17:28,060 --> 00:17:31,262
ON MY OWN FREE WILL.

454
00:17:31,262 --> 00:17:33,631
AND THEN IZAYA TOLD THEM WHERE

455
00:17:33,631 --> 00:17:35,232
I WOULD BE, SO...

456
00:17:35,232 --> 00:17:35,698
>> I KNEW.

457
00:17:35,698 --> 00:17:36,366
>> WHA?

458
00:17:36,366 --> 00:17:37,534
>> IZAYA KEPT TELLING YOU MORE

459
00:17:37,534 --> 00:17:38,434
STUFF, RIGHT?

460
00:17:38,434 --> 00:17:39,435
LIKE TO PRETEND YOU COULDN’T

461
00:17:39,435 --> 00:17:41,102
WALK SO I’D FEEL GUILTY AND

462
00:17:41,102 --> 00:17:42,738
NEVER LEAVE YOU.

463
00:17:42,738 --> 00:17:44,539
HE PLAYED ME LIKE A PAWN THE

464
00:17:44,539 --> 00:17:46,306
WHOLE TIME.

465
00:17:46,306 --> 00:17:47,274
>> HOW DID YOU...

466
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:50,844
>> HEY, I’M PSYCHIC REMEMBER?

467
00:17:50,844 --> 00:17:52,811
>> FINALLY, I’VE GONE AGAINST

468

IZAYA FOR THE FIRST TIME.

469
00:17:54,679 --> 00:17:57,114
>> I’M NOW ABLE TO SAY THIS...

470
00:17:57,114 --> 00:17:58,782
I COULDN’T SAVE YOU.

471
00:17:58,782 --> 00:17:59,516
I’M SORRY.

472
00:17:59,516 --> 00:18:00,651
>> OH.

473
00:18:00,651 --> 00:18:02,352
>> BUT STILL THAT DOESN’T

474
00:18:02,352 --> 00:18:04,354
MEAN THAT I DON’T LOVE YOU.

475
00:18:04,354 --> 00:18:05,587
BECAUSE I DO.

476
00:18:05,587 --> 00:18:07,648
SO DON’T LEAVE ME.

477
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:13,293
HEY!

478
00:18:13,293 --> 00:18:15,395
>> YOU ARE SUCH AN IDIOT.

479
00:18:15,395 --> 00:18:17,096
IT’S UNBELIEVABLE.

480
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,397
>> OKAY, YOU’VE MENTIONED THAT.

481
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:19,665
BUT CAN’T YOU AT LEAST LET ME

482
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,499
HAVE ONE FLAW?

483
00:18:21,499 --> 00:18:22,733
>> IF YOU REALIZE IT’S A FLAW,

484
00:18:22,733 --> 00:18:25,335
FIX IT.

485
00:18:25,335 --> 00:18:27,236
YOU KNOW WHAT?

486
00:18:27,236 --> 00:18:31,273
WE’LL FIX IT TOGETHER.

487
00:18:31,273 --> 00:18:33,175
>> SEVERAL DAYS LATER, MASAOMI

488
00:18:33,175 --> 00:18:34,876
AND SAKI MIKAJIMA DISAPPEARED

TOGETHER.

490
00:18:38,111 --> 00:18:39,312
HE TURNED IN A LETTER TO THE

AND THEN HE VANISHED.

THE NORMAL EVERYDAY LIFE THE

494
00:18:45,684 --> 00:18:48,419
THREE OF US HAD WAS GONE.

495

BUT THE CITY, IT STAYED THE

PROBLEMS.

512
