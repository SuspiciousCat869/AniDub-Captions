ANYTHING, BUT I WOULDN’T REALLY

OTHERS?

28
00:02:12,985 --> 00:02:14,119
CAN YOU TELL, WHEN EVERYTHING

29
00:02:14,119 --> 00:02:18,055
LOOKS THE SAME AS ALWAYS?

30
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,223

31
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:20,758
CONGRATULATE EVERYONE--

WELCOME YOU TO OUR SCHOOL.

33
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,294
THESE ARE CHALLENGING TIMES FOR

34
00:02:23,294 --> 00:02:24,295
JAPAN.

35
00:02:24,295 --> 00:02:25,228
WE’RE SEEING THE BIRTH RATE

36
00:02:25,228 --> 00:02:26,663
DECLINE, AND OUR MIDDLE CLASS

37
00:02:26,663 --> 00:02:28,131
IS DISAPPEARING.

38
00:02:28,131 --> 00:02:28,998
BUT WHEN I LOOK OUT AT YOUR

39
00:02:28,998 --> 00:02:31,033
FACES, I KNOW THE FUTURE OF OUR

40
00:02:31,033 --> 00:02:33,102
COUNTRY IS NOT IN ANY DANGER.

41
00:02:33,102 --> 00:02:35,137
IN FACT, I SEE IN EVERY STUDENT

42
00:02:35,137 --> 00:02:37,038
HERE A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR US

43

47
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:44,578

48
00:02:44,578 --> 00:02:46,546
>> LOOK AROUND. WHAT DO YOU SEE?

49
00:02:46,546 --> 00:02:47,914
YOU FIND YOURSELF THINKING,

50
00:02:47,914 --> 00:02:49,716
"I’VE SEEN THIS BEFORE.

51
00:02:49,716 --> 00:02:54,720

EXPERIENCED BEFORE.

81
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,667

TARDY.

83
00:03:52,101 --> 00:03:53,069

IT’S NICE TO MEET ALL OF YOU.

88
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:02,844
>> SOMETIMES, THOUGH, WHEN YOU

00:04:02,844 --> 00:04:05,212
LEAST EXPECT IT, YOU’LL GET A

90
00:04:05,212 --> 00:04:07,014
TINY GLIMPSE OF ANOTHER REALITY

91
00:04:07,014 --> 00:04:09,249
SEEPING INTO YOURS.

92
00:04:09,249 --> 00:04:11,285

93
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,285
PLEASE TAKE YOUR SEAT, AND WE’LL

94

MOVE ON.

95
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,721
>> NO, SIR.

96
00:04:14,721 --> 00:04:15,754
>> HUH?

97
00:04:15,754 --> 00:04:17,723
>> LISTEN, I JUST WANT TO SAY I

98
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,291
WON’T BE AT SCHOOL FOR A WHILE.

99
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:21,326
WELL, ACTUALLY, I’LL NEVER BE

100
00:04:21,326 --> 00:04:22,294
BACK.

101
00:04:22,294 --> 00:04:23,095
>> HUH?

102
00:04:23,095 --> 00:04:25,296
>> I JUST CAME TO LET YOU KNOW.

103
00:04:25,296 --> 00:04:26,931
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

104
00:04:26,931 --> 00:04:29,266
>> HOLD ON A SECOND, SEIJI.

105
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:30,967
YOU CAN’T MEAN IT.

106
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:33,236
>> I’M NOT JOKING, SIR.

107
00:04:33,236 --> 00:04:35,105
I HAVE MY REASONS.

108
00:04:35,105 --> 00:04:36,071
THIS IS SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT

109
00:04:36,071 --> 00:04:37,206
TO ME.

110
00:04:37,206 --> 00:04:38,808
I GOTTA GO.

111
00:04:38,808 --> 00:04:39,842
I CAN’T WASTE ANY MORE TIME WITH

112
00:04:39,842 --> 00:04:40,742
YOU PEOPLE.

113
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:42,844
GOOD-BYE, SIR.

114
00:04:42,844 --> 00:04:45,079
>> UH, SEIJI, WAIT, PLEASE.

115
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,414
JUST HOLD ON A SECOND.

116
00:04:46,414 --> 00:04:47,881
>> A CRACK APPEARS IN YOUR

117
00:04:47,881 --> 00:04:49,217
PEACEFUL LIFE.

118
00:04:49,217 --> 00:04:50,283
IT THROWS YOU OFF GUARD.

119
00:04:50,283 --> 00:04:52,385
MAKES YOU RETHINK THINGS.

120
00:04:52,385 --> 00:04:54,121
THERE’S A GIRL SITTING IN THIS

121
00:04:54,121 --> 00:04:55,722
CLASSROOM WHO CAUGHT A GLIMPSE

122
00:04:55,722 --> 00:04:57,256
OF JUST SUCH A THING.

123
00:04:57,256 --> 00:04:59,425
SHE EXPERIENCED IT TWO DAYS AGO,

124
00:04:59,425 --> 00:05:01,760
WHEN SHE SHOULD HAVE DIED.

125
00:05:05,230 --> 00:05:07,198
SHE WAS BORN IN A NORMAL HOME,

126
00:05:07,198 --> 00:05:09,266
THE KIND YOU CAN FIND ANYWHERE.

127
00:05:09,266 --> 00:05:11,335
IT WAS A TYPICAL LIFE, WITH NO

128
00:05:11,335 --> 00:05:16,372
REAL BUMPS OR BRUISES.

129
00:05:16,372 --> 00:05:18,174
IT ARRIVED IN HER MAILBOX AROUND

130
00:05:18,174 --> 00:05:19,142
THE TIME SHE STARTED JUNIOR

131
00:05:19,142 --> 00:05:20,709
HIGH.

132
00:05:20,709 --> 00:05:21,677
IT CAME WITHOUT WARNING OR

133
00:05:21,677 --> 00:05:24,212
PROVOCATION.

134
00:05:29,784 --> 00:05:31,919
>> WHAT WAS IN THE ENVELOPE?

135
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:33,187
>> PHOTOS.

136
00:05:33,187 --> 00:05:34,120
I THINK MY DAD’S HAVING AN

137
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,221
AFFAIR.

138
00:05:35,221 --> 00:05:36,422
THE PICTURE SHOWED HIM WITH

139
00:05:36,422 --> 00:05:38,058
ANOTHER WOMAN.

140
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:38,991
AND THERE WAS A LETTER THAT

141
00:05:38,991 --> 00:05:40,760
SAID, "ARE YOU GOING TO LET HIM

142
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:42,327
GET AWAY WITH THIS?"

143
00:05:42,327 --> 00:05:43,462
I THINK THEY WERE SENT BY

144
00:05:43,462 --> 00:05:44,997
SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE WOMAN IN

145
00:05:44,997 --> 00:05:46,298
THE PHOTOS.

146
00:05:46,298 --> 00:05:48,199
>> YOUR DAD’S A JERK, BUT THE

147
00:05:48,199 --> 00:05:49,768
GUY SENDING THE PHOTOS IS EVEN

148
00:05:49,768 --> 00:05:52,736
WORSE.

149
00:05:52,736 --> 00:05:54,071
>> I WAS SO SHOCKED.

150
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,372
I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

151
00:05:55,372 --> 00:05:56,940
I FIGURED THE BEST THING WOULD

152
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:00,209
BE JUST TO HIDE THEM, SO I DID.

153
00:06:00,209 --> 00:06:01,911
BUT EVER SINCE THEN, ALL THE

154
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:03,412
NORMAL STUFF WE DO AS A FAMILY

155
00:06:03,412 --> 00:06:05,747
STARTED TO FEEL KIND OF FAKE AND

156
00:06:05,747 --> 00:06:07,348
WEIRD TO ME.

157
00:06:07,348 --> 00:06:08,483
>> MUST HAVE BEEN HARD.

158
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:10,885
>> ARE YOU OKAY OVER THERE, RIO?

159
00:06:10,885 --> 00:06:12,219
>> I COULD ONLY TAKE IT FOR SIX

160
00:06:12,219 --> 00:06:14,354
MONTHS.

161
00:06:14,354 --> 00:06:15,890
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE BETTER FOR

162
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,358
EVERYONE IF MY MOM FOUND OUT.

163
00:06:22,195 --> 00:06:23,229
>> IF IT’S TOO HARD TO TALK

164
00:06:23,229 --> 00:06:26,064
ABOUT, YOU DON’T HAVE TO.

165
00:06:26,064 --> 00:06:27,232
I’VE GOT A LOT OF THINGS I DON’T

166
00:06:27,232 --> 00:06:29,301
LIKE TALKING ABOUT.

167
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:30,402
>> NO, NO, NO.

168
00:06:30,402 --> 00:06:34,972
I WANT TO TELL YOU.

169
00:06:34,972 --> 00:06:36,006
>> HOW COULD YOU MISTAKE A CELL

170
00:06:36,006 --> 00:06:37,073
PHONE FOR A REMOTE CONTROL?

171
00:06:37,073 --> 00:06:37,908
>> NOTHING REALLY CHANGED,

172
00:06:37,908 --> 00:06:38,942
THOUGH.

173
00:06:38,942 --> 00:06:39,976
I DON’T KNOW IF MOM WAS JUST

174
00:06:39,976 --> 00:06:41,811
IGNORING THE WHOLE THING, OR IF

175
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:43,379
SOMEHOW OR ANOTHER THEY’D WORKED

176
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:44,347
IT OUT WHEN I WASN’T AROUND.

177
00:06:44,347 --> 00:06:45,347
>> HASN’T THAT EVER HAPPENED TO

>> EVERYTHING STAYED THE SAME.

180
00:06:47,749 --> 00:06:49,384
MY DAD KEPT TELLING THE SAME

181
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:51,953
DUMB JOKES, AND MOM KEPT MAKING

182
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:57,224
HER STEW TOO SWEET.

183
00:06:57,224 --> 00:06:58,792
SO I FIGURED MAYBE IT WOULD BE

184
00:06:58,792 --> 00:07:04,396
BETTER IF I JUST DISAPPEARED.

185
00:07:04,396 --> 00:07:05,832
I GUESS THAT’S ALL I’VE BEEN

186
00:07:05,832 --> 00:07:09,401
THINKING ABOUT LATELY.

187
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:11,302
>> THAT’S A LOT LIKE HOW I FEEL,

188

>> TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

192
00:07:18,175 --> 00:07:21,077
>> I WAS DATING THIS GIRL AND,

193
00:07:21,077 --> 00:07:23,012
WELL, SHE HOOKED UP WITH MY DAD.

194
00:07:23,012 --> 00:07:24,347
>> THAT’S AWFUL.

195
00:07:24,347 --> 00:07:26,315
>> YEAH, BUT MY MOM WAS THE ONE

196
00:07:26,315 --> 00:07:27,883
I WAS ANGRY WITH.

197
00:07:27,883 --> 00:07:29,852
>> WHAT DID SHE SAY?

198
00:07:29,852 --> 00:07:31,453
>> SHE SAID STUFF LIKE THAT

199
00:07:31,453 --> 00:07:33,020
HAPPENS, AND IT WAS MORE

200
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,055
IMPORTANT THAT THE NEIGHBORS

201
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:35,322
DIDN’T FIND OUT.

202
00:07:35,322 --> 00:07:36,490
SHE DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING ABOUT

203
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:38,459
HOW SHE FELT.

204
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:40,861
SO I THOUGHT MAYBE SHE THINKS

205
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,362
THE FAMILY’S REPUTATION IS MORE

206
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,430
IMPORTANT THAN ME.

207
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,466
OR, I DON’T KNOW, MAYBE SHE WAS

208

THINKING ABOUT MY FUTURE AND

209
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,534

210
00:07:49,534 --> 00:07:51,070
>> I DOUBT IT.

211
00:07:51,070 --> 00:07:52,337
>> MAYBE YOU’RE RIGHT.

212

>> I AM.

213
00:07:53,204 --> 00:07:54,172
SHE DOESN’T CARE ABOUT YOU OR

HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT WHAT’S GOING

215

ON.

216
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,375
THE ONLY THING SHE CARES ABOUT

217
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,076
IS--

218

>> MISS MAZENDA, WOULD YOU LIKE

222
00:08:08,584 --> 00:08:11,087
TO DISAPPEAR WITH ME?

223
00:08:11,087 --> 00:08:12,921
MAYBE IF WE DIE TOGETHER,

224
00:08:12,921 --> 00:08:14,289
THEY’LL UNDERSTAND HOW WE FEEL

225
00:08:14,289 --> 00:08:15,390
ABOUT THE WAY THEY’RE TREATING

226
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,457
US.

227
00:08:16,457 --> 00:08:18,593
MAYBE THEN THEY’LL REALIZE WHAT

228
00:08:18,593 --> 00:08:24,030
THEY SHOULD HAVE CARED ABOUT.

229
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:26,265
>> IT SEEMS STUPID TO HER NOW,

230
00:08:26,265 --> 00:08:28,101
BUT WHEN SHE LEFT HOME THAT DAY,

231
00:08:28,101 --> 00:08:29,035
SHE WAS READY TO GO THROUGH WITH

232
00:08:29,035 --> 00:08:30,269
IT.

233
00:08:30,269 --> 00:08:31,970
NAKURA’S WORDS GAVE HER THE

00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:33,538
CONFIDENCE SHE NEEDED.

235
00:08:33,538 --> 00:08:35,940
KNOWING THAT HE SHARED HER PAIN,

236
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,376
SHE FELT COMPELLED TO SEE HIM.

237
00:08:39,376 --> 00:08:40,577
AT THIS POINT, EVEN IF HE WAS

238
00:08:40,577 --> 00:08:44,448
LYING, SHE HAD NOTHING TO LOSE.

239
00:08:44,448 --> 00:08:47,083
OR SO SHE THOUGHT.

240
00:08:50,453 --> 00:08:51,621
>> YES?

241
00:08:51,621 --> 00:08:53,989

242
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:56,057
>> YES, I AM.

243
00:08:56,057 --> 00:08:57,392
ARE YOU MR. NAKURA?

244
00:08:57,392 --> 00:08:58,426
>> WONDERFUL!

245

>> THE SECOND SHE SAW HIS FACE,

246
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,295
SHE BEGAN TO WONDER IF THAT

247
00:09:01,295 --> 00:09:04,197
REALLY WAS NAKURA.

248
00:09:04,197 --> 00:09:05,365
BUT SHE WASN’T ABOUT TO TURN

249
00:09:05,365 --> 00:09:06,433
BACK NOW...

00:09:06,433 --> 00:09:07,434
>> LET’S GET GOING, SHALL WE?

251
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,335
>> SO SHE IGNORED HER

252
00:09:08,335 --> 00:09:09,569
SUSPICIONS AND WENT WITH HIM

253
00:09:09,569 --> 00:09:12,004

266
00:09:39,094 --> 00:09:40,061
HER.

267
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:41,563
BUT JUST BEFORE SHE PASSED OUT,

268
00:09:41,563 --> 00:09:42,930
SHE THOUGHT TO HERSELF,

269
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,465
"THIS IS MY FATE."

270
00:09:44,465 --> 00:09:46,133

272
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:49,269
THIS WAS THE END.

273
00:09:49,269 --> 00:09:50,370
SHE WOULD DISAPPEAR WITHOUT

HAPPENED TO HER, AS IF SHE WAS

NEVER HERE TO BEGIN WITH.

343
00:13:34,725 --> 00:13:36,827
THE PERSON EMITTING THIS WARMTH.

344
00:13:36,827 --> 00:13:38,595
WHAT WERE THEY THINKING, WHAT

345
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:40,264
DID THEY KNOW?

346
00:13:40,264 --> 00:13:42,098
HOW DID THEY LIVE?

347
00:13:42,098 --> 00:13:44,333
WHEN THIS PERSON LOOKED AT HER,

348
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,469
WHAT DID THEY SEE?

349
00:13:51,606 --> 00:13:54,175
>> I UNDERSTAND.

350
00:14:19,697 --> 00:14:21,732
[door squeaks]

351
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:46,486
>> MISS MAZENDA.

352
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,625
IT’S NICE TO MEET YOU.

353
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:54,692
I’M NAKURA.

354
00:14:54,692 --> 00:14:56,794
>> HOW DO I KNOW THAT FOR SURE?

355
00:14:56,794 --> 00:14:57,762
>> BECAUSE I’M THE NAKURA WHO

356
00:14:57,762 --> 00:15:00,197
WANTS TO DISAPPEAR WITH YOU.

357
00:15:00,197 --> 00:15:02,599
>> IT <i>IS</i> YOU.

358
00:15:02,599 --> 00:15:04,801
SO THEN, I GUESS YOU’RE THE ONE

359
00:15:04,801 --> 00:15:06,569
WHO SAVED ME BACK THERE?

360
00:15:06,569 --> 00:15:08,704
>> RIGHT, THAT’S ME.

361
00:15:08,704 --> 00:15:09,739
>> I DON’T KNOW HOW TO THANK

362
00:15:09,739 --> 00:15:10,673
YOU.

363
00:15:10,673 --> 00:15:12,608
>> WERE YOU REALLY SCARED?

364
00:15:12,608 --> 00:15:14,243
>> YES.

365
00:15:14,243 --> 00:15:15,877
>> THAT MUST HAVE BEEN ROUGH.

366
00:15:15,877 --> 00:15:17,512
>> IT WAS.

367
00:15:17,512 --> 00:15:18,680
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT THE

368
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,481
KIDNAPPING, THOUGH?

369
00:15:20,481 --> 00:15:21,815
>> EASY. I’M THE ONE WHO HAD

370
00:15:21,815 --> 00:15:23,917
THOSE THREE LOSERS KIDNAP YOU.

371
00:15:23,917 --> 00:15:26,386
CLEVER, HUH?

372
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:28,388
OH, AND THAT RESCUE WAS ARRANGED

373
00:15:28,388 --> 00:15:29,922
BY YOUR TRULY AS WELL.

374
00:15:29,922 --> 00:15:32,524
>> YOU ARRANGED IT?

375
00:15:32,524 --> 00:15:33,525
>> LET’S RECAP THE LAST FEW

376
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:35,627
MOMENTS OF YOUR LIFE, SHALL WE?

377
00:15:35,627 --> 00:15:36,562
YOU WERE SCARED WHEN YOU WERE

378
00:15:36,562 --> 00:15:37,763
KIDNAPPED, DESPITE THE FACT THAT

379
00:15:37,763 --> 00:15:39,230
YOU WANTED TO DIE IN THE FIRST

380
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:40,365
PLACE, AND THAT MADE YOU MAD.

381
00:15:40,365 --> 00:15:41,799
NOW, IF YOU FOUGHT BACK AGAINST

382
00:15:41,799 --> 00:15:42,967
YOUR KIDNAPPERS, YOU’D BE

383
00:15:42,967 --> 00:15:44,301
DENYING THE PART OF YOU THAT

384
00:15:44,301 --> 00:15:45,469
WANTED TO DIE.

385
00:15:45,469 --> 00:15:46,770
SO YOU DECIDED TO GIVE UP, AND

386
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:48,272
ACCEPTED YOUR FATE.

387
00:15:48,272 --> 00:15:49,673
BUT NOW THAT YOU’RE SAFE AND

388
00:15:49,673 --> 00:15:50,740
SOUND, YOU’RE THRILLED YOU

389
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,775
DIDN’T DIE.

390
00:15:51,775 --> 00:15:53,809
I WANTED TO SEE THE LOOK ON YOUR

391
00:15:53,809 --> 00:15:56,679
FACE WHEN I TOLD YOU THAT.

392
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:57,846
I WANTED TO SEE WHAT YOU LOOKED

393
00:15:57,846 --> 00:15:59,647
LIKE WHEN YOU CAME FACE TO FACE

394
00:15:59,647 --> 00:16:00,815
WITH SOMEONE WHO COULD SEE RIGHT

395
00:16:00,815 --> 00:16:01,849
THROUGH YOUR PATHETIC

396
00:16:01,849 --> 00:16:04,751
INTENTIONS.

397
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,353
>> WHY WOULD YOU--

398
00:16:06,353 --> 00:16:08,622
>> WHY WOULD I? LET’S SEE.

399
00:16:08,622 --> 00:16:10,323
IT MIGHT SOUND PHILOSOPHICAL,

400
00:16:10,323 --> 00:16:11,691
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE A SMART GIRL,

401
00:16:11,691 --> 00:16:12,692
SO I THINK YOU’LL BE ABLE TO

402
00:16:12,692 --> 00:16:13,759
UNDERSTAND.

403
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:14,860
ANYWAY, I’LL TRY TO EXPLAIN IT

404
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:15,795
TO YOU.

405
00:16:15,795 --> 00:16:17,829
SIMPLY PUT, I LOVE HUMANS.

406
00:16:17,829 --> 00:16:18,963
THINK ABOUT IT--

407
00:16:18,963 --> 00:16:19,998
HUMAN BEINGS ARE THE MOST

408
00:16:19,998 --> 00:16:21,365
INTERESTING CREATURES YOU COULD

409
00:16:21,365 --> 00:16:22,734
EVER HOPE TO FIND.

410
00:16:22,734 --> 00:16:23,701
OH, AND WHEN I SAID I LOVE

411
00:16:23,701 --> 00:16:25,769
HUMANS, I MEANT <i>ALL</i> HUMANS,

412
00:16:25,769 --> 00:16:27,638
NOT YOU SPECIFICALLY.

413
00:16:27,638 --> 00:16:31,874
IMPORTANT DETAIL.

414
00:16:31,874 --> 00:16:34,010
>> SO THEN, YOU LIED?

415
00:16:34,010 --> 00:16:35,745
>> YOU’RE GETTING THE PICTURE.

416
00:16:35,745 --> 00:16:37,346
HOW WONDERFUL.

417
00:16:37,346 --> 00:16:38,847
COME HERE.

418
00:16:46,921 --> 00:16:48,388
MANY PEOPLE HAVE JUMPED TO THEIR

419
00:16:48,388 --> 00:16:49,656
DEATHS FROM THE VERY SPOT YOU’RE

420
00:16:49,656 --> 00:16:51,425
STANDING ON.

421
00:16:51,425 --> 00:16:52,492
IT’S NOT REALLY FAMOUS FOR IT OR

422
00:16:52,492 --> 00:16:53,893
ANYTHING, BUT IT’S HIGH ENOUGH

423
00:16:53,893 --> 00:16:55,528
THAT IF YOU JUMP, THE FALL <i>WILL</i>

424
00:16:55,528 --> 00:16:56,662
KILL YOU.

425
00:16:56,662 --> 00:16:59,532
LOOK. SEE THAT STAIN DOWN THERE?

426
00:17:06,704 --> 00:17:08,405
TELL ME SOMETHING.

427
00:17:08,405 --> 00:17:10,741
YOU THINK YOU’RE SPECIAL?

428
00:17:10,741 --> 00:17:11,875
YOU’RE NOT.

429
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,476
EVERYONE’S THE SAME.

430
00:17:13,476 --> 00:17:16,446
EVERYONE LIES, EVERYONE HIDES

431
00:17:16,446 --> 00:17:17,447
THINGS.

432
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:18,313
NO ONE MAKES IT THROUGH THIS

433
00:17:18,313 --> 00:17:20,515
LIFE BEING <i>COMPLETELY</i> HONEST.

434
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:22,517
I BET YOU’VE GOT A COUPLE OF

435
00:17:22,517 --> 00:17:23,785
JUICY SECRETS YOU WOULDN’T TELL

436
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:25,519
YOUR BEST FRIEND.

437
00:17:25,519 --> 00:17:27,055
SO EXPLAIN THIS.

438
00:17:27,055 --> 00:17:28,056
HOW COME IT’S OKAY FOR YOU TO

439
00:17:28,056 --> 00:17:29,557
HAVE SECRETS, BUT NOT YOUR

440
00:17:29,557 --> 00:17:30,558
PARENTS?

441
00:17:30,558 --> 00:17:32,559
>> WELL, I--

00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:33,860
>> YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT MY

00:17:33,860 --> 00:17:35,462
THOUGHTS ARE ON THIS?

444
00:17:35,462 --> 00:17:36,563
I THINK IF YOU’RE HAVING AN

445
00:17:36,563 --> 00:17:37,530
AFFAIR, OR IF YOUR SPOUSE KNOWS,

446
00:17:37,530 --> 00:17:38,698
AT TIMES YOU STILL LAUGH AT THE

447
00:17:38,698 --> 00:17:40,499
SAME DUMB JOKES.

448
00:17:40,499 --> 00:17:41,533
YOU KEEP EATING THE SAME SWEET

449
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:42,501
STEW.

450
00:17:42,501 --> 00:17:44,770
YOU JUST KEEP GOING.

>> [gasps]

452
00:17:47,438 --> 00:17:48,573
>> YOU SEE?

453
00:17:48,573 --> 00:17:50,040
WHATEVER PROBLEMS THEY HAD,

454
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,608
THEY’RE JUST A BIG OLD STAIN ON

455
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:52,776
THE PAVEMENT NOW.

456
00:17:52,776 --> 00:17:53,843
EVERYONE’S THE SAME, NO

457
00:17:53,843 --> 00:17:55,445
EXCEPTIONS.

458
00:17:55,445 --> 00:17:59,548
ALL OF THEM EQUAL BEFORE GOD.

459
00:17:59,548 --> 00:18:01,384
WANT ME TO LET GO?

460
00:18:01,384 --> 00:18:04,619
>> [breathing uneasily]

461
00:18:07,589 --> 00:18:11,592
>> YOU GET IT NOW?

462
00:18:11,592 --> 00:18:14,995
WELL, I GOTTA BOUNCE.

463
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,362
THANKS A LOT FOR PROVING JUST

464
00:18:16,362 --> 00:18:18,031
HOW UGLY AND IMMATURE YOU ARE.

465
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:19,599
IT’S BEEN REAL.

466
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,900
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, I DON’T

467
00:18:20,900 --> 00:18:22,534
REALLY CARE ABOUT YOUR PROBLEMS.

468
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,936
I JUST WANTED TO SEE HOW YOU

469
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:25,404
HANDLED YOURSELF.

470
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,805
YOU DIDN’T LET ME DOWN, THOUGH.

471
00:18:26,805 --> 00:18:28,072
YOU’RE JUST AS BORING AS I

472
00:18:28,072 --> 00:18:29,507
IMAGINED YOU TO BE.

473
00:18:29,507 --> 00:18:30,774
I KNEW YOU NEVER REALLY WANTED

474
00:18:30,774 --> 00:18:32,710
TO KILL YOURSELF.

475
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,077
THANKS AGAIN.

476
00:18:34,077 --> 00:18:35,345
I HAD AN EXCELLENT TIME, MISS

477
00:18:35,345 --> 00:18:37,580
MAZENDA.

478
00:18:50,525 --> 00:18:52,693
>> SHE HESITATED FOR A MOMENT.

479
00:18:52,693 --> 00:18:54,128
SHE THOUGHT MAYBE SHE COULD GET

480
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:57,064
BACK AT HIM BY ACTUALLY JUMPING.

481
00:18:57,064 --> 00:18:58,832
BUT THEN SHE BEGAN TO WONDER IF

482
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:00,634
THIS WAS THE EXACT OPPORTUNITY

483
00:19:00,634 --> 00:19:02,401
SHE HAD BEEN WAITING FOR.

484
00:19:02,401 --> 00:19:03,669
MAYBE THE HORRIBLE THINGS HE

485
00:19:03,669 --> 00:19:05,371
SAID WERE WHAT SHE NEEDED TO

486
00:19:05,371 --> 00:19:07,639
HEAR.

487
00:19:11,809 --> 00:19:14,411
BUT THEN, SOMETHING UNEXPECTED

488
00:19:14,411 --> 00:19:16,480
HAPPENED.

489
00:19:46,438 --> 00:19:49,675
>> WAIT.

490
00:19:49,675 --> 00:19:52,710
TELL ME WHY.

491
00:20:07,923 --> 00:20:10,058
>> AND AGAIN SHE GOES ABOVE AND

492
00:20:10,058 --> 00:20:15,530
BEYOND.

493
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:16,698
>> THE GIRL THOUGHT ABOUT HER

494
00:20:16,698 --> 00:20:19,733
MOTHER AND FATHER...

495
00:20:19,733 --> 00:20:21,568
ABOUT HER FATHER’S LOVER.

496
00:20:21,568 --> 00:20:22,435
AND THEN AGAIN ABOUT HER

497
00:20:22,435 --> 00:20:23,636
PARENTS.

498
00:20:23,636 --> 00:20:24,704
THEY ALL HAD SECRETS SHE’D NEVER

499
00:20:24,704 --> 00:20:26,706
KNOW ABOUT.

500
00:20:26,706 --> 00:20:29,574
AND WAS THAT SO TERRIBLE?

501
00:20:29,574 --> 00:20:30,609
MAYBE THEY WEREN’T AS SELFISH OR

502
00:20:30,609 --> 00:20:32,111
EVIL OR CORRUPT AS SHE’D

503
00:20:32,111 --> 00:20:33,845
ORIGINALLY THOUGHT.

504
00:20:33,845 --> 00:20:35,714
MAYBE THEIR BEHAVIOR WASN’T A

505
00:20:35,714 --> 00:20:37,748
SIGN OF WEAKNESS, OR SOME KIND

506
00:20:37,748 --> 00:20:39,517
OF COMPROMISE.

507
00:20:39,517 --> 00:20:41,585
AS SHE LOOKED FOR THE WAY HOME,

508
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:42,685
SHE THOUGHT ABOUT FORGIVING

509
00:20:42,685 --> 00:20:47,924
THEM, AND KEEPING IT A SECRET.

510
00:20:47,924 --> 00:20:49,658
EVER SINCE THEN, THE WORLD HAS

511
00:20:49,658 --> 00:20:51,227
LOOKED DIFFERENT.

512
00:20:51,227 --> 00:20:52,661
EVERYONE SHE SAW HAD THEIR OWN

513
00:20:52,661 --> 00:20:54,596
LIVES TO LIVE, WITH THEIR OWN

514
00:20:54,596 --> 00:20:56,097
LITTLE SECRETS.

515
00:20:56,097 --> 00:20:57,565
AND SHE REALIZED THAT WAS

516
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,666
NORMAL.

517
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,067
>> WHERE DO YOU WANT TO GO?

518
00:21:00,067 --> 00:21:01,135
I’LL TAKE YOU WHEREVER.

519
00:21:01,135 --> 00:21:02,769
JUST BUY ME FOOD.

520
00:21:02,769 --> 00:21:04,071
>> OKAY.

521
00:21:04,071 --> 00:21:05,639
HOW ABOUT A BOOKSTORE?

522
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,006
>> UH, YEAH...

523
00:21:07,006 --> 00:21:07,941
THERE’S, LIKE, A TON OF

524
00:21:07,941 --> 00:21:08,875
BOOKSTORES AROUND HERE.

525
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,143
>> EVEN THESE TWO, AS NORMAL AS

526
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:12,010
THEY SEEM, PROBABLY HAVE SECRETS

527
00:21:12,010 --> 00:21:12,745
OF THEIR OWN.

528
00:21:12,745 --> 00:21:13,746
>> JUST THOUGHT I’D LOOK FOR

529
00:21:13,746 --> 00:21:14,479
SOME MANGA.

530
00:21:14,479 --> 00:21:15,180
>> FEELINGS THEY COULD NEVER

531
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:16,248
TELL ANYONE.

532
00:21:16,248 --> 00:21:18,583
>> PLEASE, WAIT!

533
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,118
SEIJI, ARE YOU SURE YOU DON’T

534
00:21:21,118 --> 00:21:22,153
KNOW ANYTHING?

535
00:21:22,153 --> 00:21:23,087
>> LEAVE ME ALONE.

536
00:21:23,087 --> 00:21:25,188
>> BUT LISTEN, SHE EVEN MISSED

537
00:21:25,188 --> 00:21:26,757
THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.

538
00:21:26,757 --> 00:21:28,191
>> I SAID I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING!

539
00:21:28,191 --> 00:21:29,659
>> WAIT. HOLD ON.

540
00:21:29,659 --> 00:21:30,626
>> HELLO!

541
00:21:30,626 --> 00:21:33,562
HEY, YOU GOOD DOWN THERE?

542
00:21:36,731 --> 00:21:38,600
>> I WONDER WHAT THAT’S ABOUT.

543
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:39,167
>> HEH HEH.

544
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:40,834
SHE TOTALLY WANTS ME.

545
00:21:40,834 --> 00:21:41,835
>> HUH?

546
00:21:41,835 --> 00:21:43,003
>> THAT CHICK WITH THE GLASSES

547
00:21:43,003 --> 00:21:44,271
HAS A CRUSH ON ME.

548
00:21:44,271 --> 00:21:45,673
BUT SHE’S AFRAID OF ALL THE

549
00:21:45,673 --> 00:21:47,140
DANGER AND RISK A GUY LIKE ME

550
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,541
BRINGS TO THE TABLE.

551
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:49,709
OH, YEAH, I’M RAD.

552
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:50,810
>> CAN YOU SPEAK A LANGUAGE THAT

553
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:51,778
I KNOW TOO?

554
00:21:51,778 --> 00:21:54,546
>> FOR THAT BOY, AND FOR THIS

555
00:21:54,546 --> 00:21:56,915
GIRL, THE WORLD THEY SEE RIGHT

556
00:21:56,915 --> 00:21:59,750
NOW IS NOT NECESSARILY REALITY.

557
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:01,086
AND SHE FOUND HERSELF THINKING

558
00:22:01,086 --> 00:22:03,020
HOW WONDERFUL IT WOULD BE IF SHE

559
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:04,621
COULD TELL SOMEONE WHAT SHE’D

560
00:22:04,621 --> 00:22:05,789
LEARNED.

561
00:22:05,789 --> 00:22:07,757
THAT NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

562
00:22:07,757 --> 00:22:09,158
THE WORLD REALLY ISN’T AS BAD AS

563
00:22:09,158 --> 00:22:11,594
YOU THINK.

564
00:22:13,929 --> 00:22:16,031
>> SO NOBODY TOLD ME YOU

565
00:22:16,031 --> 00:22:17,632
SWITCHED PROFESSIONS AND BECAME

566
00:22:17,632 --> 00:22:21,569
A DEFENDER OF THE INNOCENT.

567
00:22:21,569 --> 00:22:22,937
I DIDN’T EXPECT THAT.

568
00:22:22,937 --> 00:22:24,105
SEE, I THOUGHT I HIRED YOU FOR

569
00:22:24,105 --> 00:22:26,873
YOUR SKILLS AS A COURIER.

570
00:22:30,076 --> 00:22:31,311
NO WAY!

571
00:22:31,311 --> 00:22:32,978
I’M JUST IZAYA ORIHARA, THE INFO

572
00:22:32,978 --> 00:22:37,282
BROKER, NOT SOME EVIL VILLAIN.

573
00:22:37,282 --> 00:22:38,850
BUT IF SOMEONE WANTS TO GO OUT

574
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,852
LIKE THAT, WHO AM I TO TELL THEM

575
00:22:40,852 --> 00:22:42,921
THEY CAN’T, YOU KNOW?

576
00:22:45,756 --> 00:22:47,190
IT WAS A LOT OF FUN,

577
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,160
MY TALENTED COURIER.

578
00:22:59,701 --> 00:23:02,703

00:24:31,278 --> 00:24:33,377
AND YOU, WE COME TO THIS TOWN

582
00:24:33,377 --> 00:24:36,044

583
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:37,144
CHANGE SOMETHING.

584
00:24:37,144 --> 00:24:39,244
NEXT TIME, RAMPANT EVIL.

585
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:40,444
WANT SUSHI?

586
00:24:40,444 --> 00:24:41,311
IT GOOD.

587

LONG TIME, NO SEE.
