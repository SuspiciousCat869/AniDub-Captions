00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,127
IT BACK.

342
00:12:38,127 --> 00:12:39,962
I’M TIRED OF LIVING WITH JUST

343
00:12:39,962 --> 00:12:43,966
FRAGMENTS OF MY MEMORIES.

344
00:12:43,966 --> 00:12:45,034
>> SHE FOLLOWED THE TRAIL AS

345
00:12:45,034 --> 00:12:47,236
FAR AS SHE POSSIBLY COULD...

346
00:12:47,236 --> 00:12:48,638
UNTIL IT BECAME APPARENT THAT

347
00:12:48,638 --> 00:12:50,206
HER HEAD WAS NO LONGER ON THE

348
00:12:50,206 --> 00:12:52,575
SAME CONTINENT.

349
00:12:52,575 --> 00:12:54,311
IT WAS ON A SHIP BOUND FOR

350
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:55,578
JAPAN.

351
00:12:55,578 --> 00:12:57,314
STOWING AWAY ON THE SHIP AND

352
00:12:57,314 --> 00:12:58,715
FOLLOWING IT WASN’T A PROBLEM.

353
00:12:58,715 --> 00:13:01,451
THE PROBLEM WAS THE HORSE.

354
00:13:01,451 --> 00:13:03,020
IT WAS THE DULLAHAN’S LOYAL

355
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,221
SERVANT.

356
00:13:04,221 --> 00:13:05,288
THE HORSE WAS SIMPLY THE SHAPE

357
00:13:05,288 --> 00:13:06,957
HER FAMILIAR HAD CHOSEN.

358
00:13:06,957 --> 00:13:08,258
IF SHE WANTED TO DISMISS IT, SHE

359
00:13:08,258 --> 00:13:09,392
COULD.

360
00:13:09,392 --> 00:13:11,094
BUT SHE HAD NO IDEA WHAT WOULD

361
00:13:11,094 --> 00:13:13,430
BECOME OF IT AFTER THAT.

362
00:13:13,430 --> 00:13:14,364
THAT BIT OF KNOWLEDGE WAS

363
00:13:14,364 --> 00:13:15,666
PROBABLY IN HER HEAD.

364
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,435
SO EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW THEY

365
00:13:17,435 --> 00:13:18,569
COULD BE SEPARATED, SHE COULDN’T

366
00:13:18,569 --> 00:13:24,375
BRING HERSELF TO DO IT.

367
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:29,447
[horse whinnies]

368
00:13:29,447 --> 00:13:34,986
AND THEN...

369
00:13:34,986 --> 00:13:38,089
ALL OF A SUDDEN...

370
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:43,061
THEY FOUND EACH OTHER.

371
00:13:43,061 --> 00:13:45,296
>> AFTER ALL THAT, I NEVER DID

372
00:13:45,296 --> 00:13:46,465
FIND IT.

373
00:13:46,465 --> 00:13:48,367
ALTHOUGH...

374
00:13:48,367 --> 00:13:49,434
>> YEAH.

375
00:13:49,434 --> 00:13:50,402
I’VE SEEN THAT OLD PAINTER GUY

376
00:13:50,402 --> 00:13:51,403
AROUND BEFORE.

377
00:13:51,403 --> 00:13:53,104
>> HUH?

378
00:13:53,104 --> 00:13:54,439
HE WAS IN SOUTH IKEBUKURO PARK

379
00:13:54,439 --> 00:13:55,674
FOR A FEW DAYS.

380
00:13:55,674 --> 00:13:56,775
>> RIGHT. THAT’S HIM.

381
00:13:56,775 --> 00:14:01,413
YOU WANT ME TO TAKE YOU TO HIM?

382
00:14:01,413 --> 00:14:02,681
I GOT TO THINK IT’S A BIT

383
00:14:02,681 --> 00:14:04,083
AWKWARD FOR YOU.

384
00:14:04,083 --> 00:14:10,022
RIGHT?

385
00:14:10,022 --> 00:14:11,323
>> ALL RIGHT.

386
00:14:11,323 --> 00:14:13,125
IT’S DONE.

387
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:14,427
>> WOW.

388
00:14:14,427 --> 00:14:15,461
THAT’S COOL.

389
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:16,462
>> YOU LOOK WAY CUTER HERE THAN

390
00:14:16,462 --> 00:14:17,630
YOU NORMALLY DO.

391
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,299
>> HEY.

392
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:21,434
YOU SURE ARE GOOD, MISTER.

393
00:14:21,434 --> 00:14:23,336
>> NO. NOT REALLY.

394
00:14:23,336 --> 00:14:24,604
THE THINGS I REALLY WANT TO

395
00:14:24,604 --> 00:14:27,740
DRAW STILL ESCAPE ME.

396
00:14:27,740 --> 00:14:29,375
>> THANK YOU SO MUCH.

397
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:30,776
>> THE PLEASURE’S ALL MINE.

398
00:14:30,776 --> 00:14:32,045
COME AGAIN.

399
00:14:32,045 --> 00:14:32,545
[giggling]

400
00:14:32,545 --> 00:14:33,413
>> OKAY.

401
00:14:33,413 --> 00:14:36,182
>> LATER.

402
00:14:36,182 --> 00:14:38,418
>> UH, SORRY, BUT IT’S GETTING

403
00:14:38,418 --> 00:14:39,520
A BIT DARK.

404
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,421
AFRAID I’M DONE FOR TODAY.

405
00:14:41,421 --> 00:14:43,457
>> YOU SAW A DULLAHAN ONCE.

406
00:14:43,457 --> 00:14:44,257
THAT TRUE?

407
00:14:44,257 --> 00:14:45,158
>> HUH?

408
00:14:45,158 --> 00:14:47,060
[sighs]

409
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:48,395
YEAH, I DID.

410
00:14:48,395 --> 00:14:50,130
A LONG TIME AGO.

411
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:52,199
I WAS A MUCH YOUNGER MAN AND

412
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,201
TRAVELLING THROUGH IRELAND.

413
00:14:54,201 --> 00:14:58,172
SAW IT WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.

414
00:14:58,172 --> 00:14:59,173
>> SOMEONE OVERHEARD YOU SAYING

415
00:14:59,173 --> 00:15:00,274
IT LOST ITS HEAD.

416
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,543
>> THAT IT HAD LOST ITS HEAD?

417
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:03,444
[laughs]

418
00:15:03,444 --> 00:15:04,779
NO, NO.

419
00:15:04,779 --> 00:15:07,114
ITS HEAD WAS NOT ATTACHED.

420
00:15:07,114 --> 00:15:08,616
AND I CAN’T DECIDE HOW THE HEAD

421
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,617
SHOULD LOOK.

422
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,219
>> both: [grunt]

423
00:15:12,219 --> 00:15:14,121
>> GO ON.

424
00:15:21,729 --> 00:15:23,265
IT WAS A WOMAN.

425
00:15:23,265 --> 00:15:26,468
AND A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN AT THAT.

426
00:15:26,468 --> 00:15:28,336
IT WAS A FOGGY NIGHT ON AN OLD

427
00:15:28,336 --> 00:15:29,571
MOUNTAIN ROAD WHEN SHE PASSED

428
00:15:29,571 --> 00:15:31,506
ME.

429
00:15:31,506 --> 00:15:32,775
SHE FLEW BY AT AN INCREDIBLE

430
00:15:32,775 --> 00:15:34,176
SPEED.

431
00:15:34,176 --> 00:15:35,477
SHE WAS A TERRIFYING BUT

432
00:15:35,477 --> 00:15:38,313
BEAUTIFUL SIGHT.

433
00:15:38,313 --> 00:15:39,582
IT WAS QUITE OBVIOUS THAT SHE

434
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:43,519
WAS NOT OF THIS WORLD.

435
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,687
WHEN I GOT BACK TO MY INN AND

436
00:15:44,687 --> 00:15:46,455
RELAYED WHAT I HAD SEEN, I WAS

437
00:15:46,455 --> 00:15:49,292
TOLD THAT IT WAS A DULLAHAN.

438
00:15:49,292 --> 00:15:50,393
AND THAT IT HAD BEEN IN THE AREA

439
00:15:50,393 --> 00:15:51,760
FOR AGES.

440
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,129
>> SO WHY DOESN’T THE DULLAHAN

441
00:15:53,129 --> 00:15:55,431
IN YOUR SKETCHBOOKS HAVE A HEAD?

442
00:15:55,431 --> 00:15:57,266
>> BECAUSE I CAN’T DRAW IT.

443
00:15:57,266 --> 00:15:58,735
THE MORE I TRY, THE MORE OUT OF

444
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:01,370
PLACE IT LOOKS.

445
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:02,471
I REMEMBER WHAT I SAW SO

446
00:16:02,471 --> 00:16:04,908
CLEARLY, BUT SOME REASON I CAN’T

447
00:16:04,908 --> 00:16:07,811
EXPRESS THAT ON PAPER.

448
00:16:07,811 --> 00:16:09,245
>> DID YOU SEE WHAT COLOR HER

449
00:16:09,245 --> 00:16:10,847
HAIR WAS OR HER EYES?

450
00:16:10,847 --> 00:16:12,249
WHAT WAS THE EXPRESSION ON HER

451
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:13,182
FACE?

452
00:16:13,182 --> 00:16:15,652
>> HEH, IF I KNEW ALL THAT, I

453
00:16:15,652 --> 00:16:17,387
WOULDN’T HAVE A PROBLEM DRAWING

454
00:16:17,387 --> 00:16:18,855
IT.

455
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,257
YOU KNOW, I WAS TALKING TO

456
00:16:20,257 --> 00:16:21,625
SOMEONE ABOUT THIS THE OTHER

457
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:22,559
DAY.

458
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,861
HE WAS AN ODD GUY.

459
00:16:23,861 --> 00:16:25,329
BUT HE SAID THE DRAWING WAS

460
00:16:25,329 --> 00:16:26,563
PERFECT AS IT WAS.

461
00:16:26,563 --> 00:16:27,832
ACCORDING TO HIM, SHE DIDN’T

462
00:16:27,832 --> 00:16:30,668
NEED A HEAD.

463
00:16:30,668 --> 00:16:33,470
HE WAS PRETTY STRANGE, THOUGH.

464
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,505
>> SO WHY ARE YOU SO OBSESSED

465
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:35,840
WITH DRAWING THIS THING?

466
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:37,442
>> BECAUSE IT WAS THE MOST

467
00:16:37,442 --> 00:16:39,610
MAGICAL THING I HAVE EVER SEEN.

468
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:41,579
IT WAS THE GREATEST EXPERIENCE

469
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:42,913
OF MY LIFE.

470
00:16:42,913 --> 00:16:44,315
AND I WANT TO GET THE MEMORY

471
00:16:44,315 --> 00:16:45,350
BACK.

472
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:47,752
I DON’T EVER WANT TO LOSE IT.

473
00:16:53,758 --> 00:16:55,193
>> ALL RIGHT, GRAMPS.

474
00:16:55,193 --> 00:16:56,561
THANKS.

475
00:16:56,561 --> 00:17:00,465
>> I SEE.

476
00:17:00,465 --> 00:17:01,767
YOU DON’T REMEMBER, DO YOU?

477
00:17:01,767 --> 00:17:04,202
RIDING PAST SOME GUY HIDING IN

478
00:17:04,202 --> 00:17:07,473
THE BUSHES.

479
00:17:07,473 --> 00:17:08,407
>> I DON’T.

480
00:17:08,407 --> 00:17:09,608
>> WELL, YOU DON’T KNOW FOR SURE

481
00:17:09,608 --> 00:17:10,842
IF THAT DULLAHAN WAS ACTUALLY

482
00:17:10,842 --> 00:17:11,777
YOU.

483
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:13,245
FOR ALL WE KNOW, HE COULD HAVE

484
00:17:13,245 --> 00:17:15,281
MADE THAT WHOLE THING UP.

485
00:17:15,281 --> 00:17:16,748
>> IT WAS REAL, AND IT WAS ME.

486
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:18,350
I KNOW IT.

487
00:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,221
>> OKAY.

488
00:17:22,221 --> 00:17:24,423
>> WHAT WAS I DOING THAT NIGHT?

489
00:17:24,423 --> 00:17:25,992
WHERE WAS I GOING AND WHY WAS

490
00:17:25,992 --> 00:17:28,227
I GOING THERE?

491
00:17:28,227 --> 00:17:29,428
>> ARE YOU SURE THAT’S REALLY

492
00:17:29,428 --> 00:17:30,763
IMPORTANT?

493
00:17:30,763 --> 00:17:32,699
>> HUH?

494
00:17:32,699 --> 00:17:34,333
>> LISTEN, YOU ARE AMAZINGLY

495
00:17:34,333 --> 00:17:35,802
AMBIGUOUS AND UNQUESTIONABLY

496
00:17:35,802 --> 00:17:37,670
UNIQUE.

497
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,306
BUT AS THINGS ARE, YOU ARE STILL

498
00:17:39,306 --> 00:17:40,740
MILES AWAY FROM ACHIEVING YOUR

499
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,642
GOAL.

500
00:17:42,642 --> 00:17:43,843
>> WHAT’S YOUR POINT?

501
00:17:43,843 --> 00:17:45,645
>> I’LL BE BLUNT.

502
00:17:45,645 --> 00:17:49,349
>> LET IT GO.

503
00:17:49,349 --> 00:17:50,517
THAT STRANGE GUY IN THE

504
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:51,919
PAINTER’S STORY, MAYBE WHAT HE

505
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,653
SAID WAS RIGHT.

506
00:17:53,653 --> 00:17:55,488
I MEAN, MAYBE YOU ARE COMPLETE

507
00:17:55,488 --> 00:17:59,660
WITHOUT YOUR HEAD.

508
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,462
PERHAPS THE TIME HAS COME TO

509
00:18:01,462 --> 00:18:03,030
MOVE ON.

510
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:04,264
YOU KNOW WHAT, LET’S GO

511
00:18:04,264 --> 00:18:05,599
SOMEWHERE.

512
00:18:05,599 --> 00:18:08,402

IF HE WERE A NORMAL PARENT, HE

BEFORE.

584
00:20:12,530 --> 00:20:13,598
