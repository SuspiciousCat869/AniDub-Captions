178
00:06:39,641 --> 00:06:41,576

179
00:06:41,576 --> 00:06:42,076

00:06:46,247 --> 00:06:48,016
>> THANK YOU FOR NOTICING.

183
00:06:48,016 --> 00:06:49,083
THAT’S RIGHT.

184
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:50,118
ONE VOTE...

185
00:06:50,118 --> 00:06:51,052

186
00:06:51,052 --> 00:06:52,620
TRULY.

00:06:59,026 --> 00:07:00,661
>> WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THAT?

192
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,163

202
00:07:16,209 --> 00:07:17,877
>> BET HE’S UP ON THE ROOF.

203
00:07:17,877 --> 00:07:18,911
THAT’S WHERE HE USUALLY HANGS

204
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,280
OUT ON LUNCH BREAK.

205
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,982
>> I BET HE WENT UP THERE TO

206
00:07:22,982 --> 00:07:24,183

00:07:24,183 --> 00:07:25,351
>> ARE YOU REALLY SURE WE

208
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:26,619
SHOULD GO UP HERE?

209
00:07:26,619 --> 00:07:27,619
WE MIGHT BE HEADING INTO A

210
00:07:27,619 --> 00:07:28,654
ROUGH CROWD.

211
00:07:28,654 --> 00:07:30,189
>> DUDE, I’M JOKING.

212
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:31,057
THE ONLY KIDS WHO SMOKE CIGS

213
00:07:31,057 --> 00:07:33,025
ON ROOFTOPS ARE THE ONES IN SOME

218
00:07:38,230 --> 00:07:39,164
HE’S NOT GONNA TELL US THE

219
00:07:39,164 --> 00:07:41,032
TRUTH ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

220
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:42,668
>> YOU JUST LEAVE THAT TO ME.

221
00:07:42,668 --> 00:07:46,204
I’VE GOT A PLAN.

00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:48,239
LET’S SEE...

223
00:07:48,239 --> 00:07:49,875

OH, COOL, YOU’RE WRITING A SONG.

231
00:08:00,317 --> 00:08:02,853
>> UH, YEAH, I AM.

232
00:08:02,853 --> 00:08:04,121
SO WHAT’S GOIN’ ON?

233
00:08:04,121 --> 00:08:05,222
YOU GUYS NEED SOMETHING?

234
00:08:05,222 --> 00:08:07,057
>> I GOT A QUESTION.

235
00:08:07,057 --> 00:08:08,258
>> GO FOR IT.

236
00:08:08,258 --> 00:08:09,693

00:08:11,128 --> 00:08:11,795

239
00:08:11,795 --> 00:08:13,397
>> MASAOMI, WHAT ARE YOU--

240
00:08:13,397 --> 00:08:14,331
>> YEAH, I’M IN WITH THEM.

241
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,199
>> AAHH!

242
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,234
>> THOUGHT SO.

243
00:08:17,234 --> 00:08:19,168
IN FACT, I HAD NO DOUBT AT ALL.

244
00:08:19,168 --> 00:08:23,039
SEE? MY INSTINCTS: PERFECT.

245
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,941
OH, THIS GUY HERE’S AN OLD

246
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:26,743
FRIEND OF MINE.

247

>> YEAH, I’M MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

248
00:08:28,777 --> 00:08:30,146
>> OH, YOU’RE THAT GUY.

249
00:08:30,146 --> 00:08:31,080
YOU’RE FAMOUS.

250
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,748
>> HUH? I AM?

251
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:33,949
>> JUST YOUR NAME.

252
00:08:33,949 --> 00:08:35,384
>> OH.

253
00:08:35,384 --> 00:08:36,419
>> WANT SOME?

254
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,286
>> SURE, THANK YOU.

255
00:08:38,286 --> 00:08:39,221
>> HMM?

256
00:08:39,221 --> 00:08:43,291
>> THANKS, MAN.

257
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,827
>> SO, TAKIGUCHI, I GOT A

258
00:08:44,827 --> 00:08:45,293
QUESTION.

259
00:08:45,293 --> 00:08:46,128
>> HMM?

260
00:08:46,128 --> 00:08:47,863
>> WHAT MADE YOU JOIN THE

261
00:08:47,863 --> 00:08:48,763
DOLLARS?

262
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:50,265
>> HUH?

263
00:08:50,265 --> 00:08:51,966
HMM.

264
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,000
I’M NOT REALLY SURE EXACTLY

265
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,070
WHY I DECIDED TO DO IT.

266
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:58,039
I THINK IT WAS SIX MONTHS AGO.

267
00:08:58,039 --> 00:08:59,674
I GOT AN EMAIL FROM SOME GUY I

268
00:08:59,674 --> 00:09:00,808
DIDN’T EVEN KNOW.

269
00:09:00,808 --> 00:09:02,209
HE MENTIONED THE DOLLARS AND

270
00:09:02,209 --> 00:09:03,244
SAID THEY DIDN’T HAVE ANY KIND

271
00:09:03,244 --> 00:09:05,446
OF RULES OR CONDITIONS.

272
00:09:05,446 --> 00:09:06,814
MY FIRST THOUGHT WAS, YEAH,

273
00:09:06,814 --> 00:09:07,915
RIGHT.

274
00:09:07,915 --> 00:09:08,882
BUT THEN I THOUGHT, IF THERE

275
00:09:08,882 --> 00:09:10,117
WAS A GROUP LIKE THAT, I’D

276
00:09:10,117 --> 00:09:13,287
WANT TO BE A PART OF IT.

277
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,456
TRUTH IS, LAST THING I WANT IS

278
00:09:15,456 --> 00:09:17,157
TO BE BOSSED AROUND OR VICE

279
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:18,992
VERSA.

280
00:09:18,992 --> 00:09:20,293
>> SO, WHAT ARE THE DOLLARS

281
00:09:20,293 --> 00:09:20,961
LIKE?

282
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:22,128
FILL US IN.

283
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:23,697
>> WELL, GUESS I’D SAY

284
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,066
TRANSPARENT, AS IN NO COLOR.

285
00:09:26,066 --> 00:09:27,233
>> TRANSPARENT?

286
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:28,801
>> YEAH.

287
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,270
THEY’RE NOT LIKE THE OTHER GUYS.

288
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,304
THE YELLOW SCARVES AND BLUE

289
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:32,272
SQUARES WERE ALL ABOUT SHOWIN’

290
00:09:32,272 --> 00:09:33,339
YOUR COLORS AND GETTIN’ INTO

291
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:34,707
TURF WARS, BUT THE DOLLARS

292
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,841
AREN’T INTO THAT.

293
00:09:35,841 --> 00:09:37,276
>> WHO WERE THE BLUE SQUARES?

294
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:38,978
>> THEY WERE A COLOR GANG THAT

295
00:09:38,978 --> 00:09:39,945
WAS A BIG DEAL WHEN I WAS IN

296
00:09:39,945 --> 00:09:41,346
MIDDLE SCHOOL.

297
00:09:41,346 --> 00:09:42,748
I DON’T KNOW THE DETAILS, BUT

298
00:09:42,748 --> 00:09:44,249
THEY GOT INTO SOME TROUBLE AND

299
00:09:44,249 --> 00:09:46,818
THEN FELL APART.

300
00:09:46,818 --> 00:09:48,153
>> MASAOMI?

301
00:09:48,153 --> 00:09:49,754
>> SO THEN, YOU’RE TELLING US

302
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:51,356
THAT YOU LIKE THE DOLLARS?

303
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:52,291
>> YEAH.

304
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:53,392
>> YOU EVER GET TOGETHER WITH

305
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,393
THE OTHER MEMBERS?

306
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,094
>> WELL, MEMBERS ONLY KNOW EACH

307
00:09:56,094 --> 00:09:57,862
OTHER BY THEIR USERNAMES.

308
00:09:57,862 --> 00:09:59,097
BUT, YEAH, I’VE MET A BUNCH OF

309
00:09:59,097 --> 00:09:59,798
’EM.

310
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,800
EITHER AT WORK OR IN TOWN.

311
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,301
JUST BY ACCIDENT.

312
00:10:03,301 --> 00:10:04,402
IF YOU THINK, "I BET HE’S WITH

313
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:05,904
THE DOLLARS," TURNS OUT THEY

314
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:07,005
USUALLY ARE.

315
00:10:07,005 --> 00:10:08,139
>> HOW CAN YOU TELL BY LOOKING

316
00:10:08,139 --> 00:10:08,906
AT THEM?

317
00:10:08,906 --> 00:10:09,473
>> I DON’T KNOW.

318
00:10:09,473 --> 00:10:10,408
IT’S HARD TO EXPLAIN.

319
00:10:10,408 --> 00:10:11,475
JUST ASK ’EM.

320
00:10:11,475 --> 00:10:12,876
I THINK MOST GUYS YOU ASK

321
00:10:12,876 --> 00:10:17,147
WOULD ADMIT IT STRAIGHT UP.

322
00:10:17,147 --> 00:10:18,315
[alarm rings]

323
00:10:18,315 --> 00:10:19,316
WELL, THAT BLOWS.

324
00:10:19,316 --> 00:10:22,419
>> SEE YA, SUCKERS!

325
00:10:22,419 --> 00:10:23,787
>> ONCE I FOUND OUT THAT

326
00:10:23,787 --> 00:10:25,022
TAKIGUCHI WAS PART OF THE

00:10:25,022 --> 00:10:27,090
DOLLARS, I SWORE I’D KEEP IT A

328
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:29,892
SECRET AND NEVER TELL ANYONE.

329
00:10:29,892 --> 00:10:31,027
I DON’T KNOW HIM, BUT I’M

330
00:10:31,027 --> 00:10:32,329
GUESSING HE WOULDN’T WANT

331
00:10:32,329 --> 00:10:33,430
PEOPLE TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT

332
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:34,230
OF IT.

333
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,197
>> ALL RIGHT, CLASS.

334
00:10:35,197 --> 00:10:36,098
>> I FIGURE IF ANYONE WANTS

335
00:10:36,098 --> 00:10:38,167
TO KNOW, THEY CAN ASK HIM.

336
00:10:38,167 --> 00:10:40,202
STAND.

337
00:10:40,202 --> 00:10:42,004

338
00:10:47,243 --> 00:10:48,410
>> OKAY, THAT’S IT FOR THE CLASS

00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:50,312
REPS MEETING.

340
00:10:50,312 --> 00:10:51,880

MONITOR MEETING IS OVER.

342
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:54,816
>> HMM.

343
00:10:54,816 --> 00:10:55,851
WELL, IF IT ISN’T, IT SHOULD

344
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:57,252

348
00:11:05,526 --> 00:11:07,062
BEEN MISSING EVEN BEFORE SCHOOL

349
00:11:07,062 --> 00:11:08,028

00:11:08,028 --> 00:11:09,964
SO HAVE YOU HEARD ANYTHING NEW

00:11:13,901 --> 00:11:16,804
>> HEY, MIKADO!

354
00:11:16,804 --> 00:11:18,138
MASAOMI SAID FOR YOU TO GO

355
00:11:18,138 --> 00:11:19,539
HOME WITHOUT HIM.

356
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:20,808
>> HUH? WHY?

357
00:11:20,808 --> 00:11:21,909
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

358
00:11:21,909 --> 00:11:23,911
>> YEAH, YEAH, THE HALL MONITORS

359
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:25,345
ARE JUST HAVING A HUGE ARGUMENT

360
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:26,213
RIGHT NOW.

361
00:11:26,213 --> 00:11:27,414
IT’S ALL GOOD.

362
00:11:27,414 --> 00:11:30,484
SEE YA!

363
00:11:30,484 --> 00:11:32,852
>> WELL, THEN, ARE YOU READY

364
00:11:32,852 --> 00:11:33,887

365
00:11:33,887 --> 00:11:39,058
>> SURE.

366
00:11:39,058 --> 00:11:40,359
>> I WONDER WHAT’S SO

367
00:11:40,359 --> 00:11:41,594
IMPORTANT THAT MASAOMI WOULD

368
00:11:41,594 --> 00:11:43,229
STAY LATE TO ARGUE ABOUT IT.

369
00:11:43,229 --> 00:11:44,230
YOU KNOW, IT’S PROBABLY JUST

370
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:44,963
LIKE CLOTHES AND...

371
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:47,133
>> MIKADO!

372
00:11:47,133 --> 00:11:48,133
DON’T SCREW IT UP WITH THAT

373
00:11:48,133 --> 00:11:49,935
FINE CHICA.

374
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:51,036
AND NEXT TIME YOU HAVE TO

375
00:11:51,036 --> 00:11:52,905
INTRODUCE ME.

376
00:11:52,905 --> 00:11:55,541
PEACE OUT. LATER!

377
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:58,276

UH, HE MEANT MISS FINECHICA.

379
00:12:00,212 --> 00:12:01,613
IT’S THIS FRENCH GIRL WE MET

380
00:12:01,613 --> 00:12:03,248
AT THAT RUSSIA SUSHI PLACE.

381
00:12:03,248 --> 00:12:05,517
AND UH, SH-SH-SHE’S GOT--GOT

382
00:12:05,517 --> 00:12:07,084
A NOSE RING!

383
00:12:07,084 --> 00:12:08,186
I’M SURE THAT’S WHAT HE’S BEEN

384
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,587
ARGUING ABOUT, WHETHER OR NOT

385
00:12:09,587 --> 00:12:10,988
THEY SHOULD ALLOW NOSE RINGS AT

386
00:12:10,988 --> 00:12:11,556
SCHOOL.

387
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:14,158
[laughs]

388
00:12:14,158 --> 00:12:15,927
>> YOU KNOW, I’VE KINDA KNOWN

389
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:17,094
WHO YOU WERE LONG BEFORE YOU

390
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:19,130
AND I EVEN MET IN CLASS.

391
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:19,997
>> HUH?

392
00:12:19,997 --> 00:12:21,132
>> WHEN I CAME TO THE SCHOOL TO

393
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:23,100
REGISTER, I SAW A LIST OF

394
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,035
NAMES ON A DESK AS I WAS

395
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,103
HANDING IN MY PAPERWORK.

396
00:12:26,103 --> 00:12:26,937
I NOTICED ONE OF THE NAMES

397
00:12:26,937 --> 00:12:27,971
RIGHT AWAY.

398
00:12:27,971 --> 00:12:28,905
I THOUGHT IT WAS COOL.

399
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:29,973
THE GUY WITH THAT NAME WAS

400
00:12:29,973 --> 00:12:31,575
RIGHT NEXT TO ME.

401
00:12:31,575 --> 00:12:33,510
AND THEN NEXT THING I KNOW, HE

402
00:12:33,510 --> 00:12:35,111
AND I ENDED UP BEING CLASS REPS

403
00:12:35,111 --> 00:12:35,545
TOGETHER.

404
00:12:35,545 --> 00:12:36,246
>> WAIT A SECOND!

405
00:12:36,246 --> 00:12:37,247
ISN’T THIS SORT OF LIKE WHAT

406
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,414
HER FRIEND MIKA DID TO THAT

407
00:12:38,414 --> 00:12:39,549
SEIJI GUY?

408
00:12:39,549 --> 00:12:41,884
OH, MAN. IS SHE A STALKER?

409
00:12:41,884 --> 00:12:43,353
HOLD ON, IF SHE’S CUTE, MAYBE

410
00:12:43,353 --> 00:12:44,920
IT’S OKAY.

411
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,055
NO, NO, NO.

412
00:12:46,055 --> 00:12:47,122
THIS IS STILL BAD.

413
00:12:47,122 --> 00:12:51,527
IF SOMETHING HAPPENS...

414
00:12:51,527 --> 00:12:52,394
>> I WANT YOU NOW!

415
00:12:52,394 --> 00:12:54,597
>> SHE COULD TOTALLY STAB ME!

416
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:55,898
OR SHE MIGHT EVEN SET MY PLACE

417
00:12:55,898 --> 00:12:57,266
ON FIRE!

418
00:12:57,266 --> 00:12:59,134
HOLD ON, WHAT IF SHE TAKES MY

419
00:12:59,134 --> 00:13:00,970
PARENTS HOSTAGE?

420
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:01,971
BUT IF SHE’S A GOOD PERSON,

421
00:13:01,971 --> 00:13:03,905
MAYBE I DON’T MIND HER STALKING

422
00:13:03,905 --> 00:13:04,939
ME.

423
00:13:04,939 --> 00:13:06,140
WHAT AM I SAYING?

424
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:07,309
IF SHE’S STALKING ME, THEN SHE

425
00:13:07,309 --> 00:13:08,943
CAN’T BE A GOOD PERSON!

426
00:13:08,943 --> 00:13:10,612
>> I WAS JUST KIDDING.

427
00:13:10,612 --> 00:13:12,013
BESIDES, YOU WOULDN’T WANT

428
00:13:12,013 --> 00:13:13,281
SOMEONE LIKE ME HANGING AROUND

429
00:13:13,281 --> 00:13:14,683
ALL THE TIME.

430
00:13:14,683 --> 00:13:15,984
>> NO, I...

431
00:13:15,984 --> 00:13:17,551
>> I KNOW THAT SOUNDED WEIRD.

432
00:13:17,551 --> 00:13:18,586
BUT DON’T WORRY, I’M NOT A

433
00:13:18,586 --> 00:13:19,988
STALKER OR ANYTHING.

434
00:13:19,988 --> 00:13:21,555
>> NO, I DIDN’T--

435
00:13:21,555 --> 00:13:23,291
WELL, I...

436
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:24,358
I’M SORRY.

437
00:13:24,358 --> 00:13:26,159
>> HUH. NO, IT’S FINE.

438
00:13:26,159 --> 00:13:27,461
I WAS THE ONE WHO STARTED IT BY

439
00:13:27,461 --> 00:13:28,429
TEASING YOU.

440
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:32,132
THERE’S NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE.

441
00:13:32,132 --> 00:13:34,067
>> ALL RIGHT.

442
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:36,569
WELL, LISTEN, I’M--I’M GLAD

443
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:38,038
WE BECAME FRIENDS.

444
00:13:38,038 --> 00:13:39,506
>> I’M GLAD WE BECAME FRIENDS

445
00:13:39,506 --> 00:13:41,341
TOO.

446
00:13:47,213 --> 00:13:48,114
>> HUH?

447
00:13:48,114 --> 00:13:49,115
>> YEAH, IT’S BEEN A LOT OF FUN.

448
00:13:49,115 --> 00:13:50,049

00:13:55,487 --> 00:13:57,957
>> HUH?

452
00:13:57,957 --> 00:14:00,092
>> I WONDER WHO THE LOSER IS.

453
00:14:00,092 --> 00:14:02,294
IT’S NOT ME, RIGHT?

454
00:14:07,065 --> 00:14:08,299

THAT WAS PRETTY SHOCKING,

556
00:17:47,507 --> 00:17:48,308
EVEN FOR ME.

557
00:17:48,308 --> 00:17:49,309

FELT LIKE I’D BEEN WAITING FOR

00:17:56,216 --> 00:17:57,517
A MOMENT LIKE THIS TO OCCUR

564
00:17:57,517 --> 00:18:02,288
FOR YEARS.

565
00:18:02,288 --> 00:18:03,590
I STILL CAN’T DESCRIBE HOW I

566
00:18:03,590 --> 00:18:06,259
FELT AT THAT EXACT MOMENT.

567
00:18:06,259 --> 00:18:07,526
I JUST FOUND MYSELF THINKING,

568

"I KNEW IT! I KNEW IT!", OVER

AND OVER AGAIN.

570
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:15,334
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

571
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:20,906
AFTER THAT, THE BLACK RIDER

572
00:18:20,906 --> 00:18:22,575
TOLD ME EVERYTHING--LIKE THE

573
00:18:22,575 --> 00:18:23,976
REAL REASON IT WAS LOOKING FOR

574
00:18:23,976 --> 00:18:26,311
THAT GIRL YESTERDAY.

575
00:18:26,311 --> 00:18:27,412
IT TOLD ME IT WAS A DULLAHAN

576
00:18:27,412 --> 00:18:28,914
NAMED CELTY.

577
00:18:28,914 --> 00:18:29,948
THAT SHE’D COME TO JAPAN IN

578
00:18:29,948 --> 00:18:30,983

579
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,217
STOLEN.

580
00:18:32,217 --> 00:18:33,685
AND WHEN CELTY SAW THE GIRL WITH

581
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:35,487
STITCHES ON HER NECK, HER FACE

582
00:18:35,487 --> 00:18:37,955
LOOKED JUST LIKE HER OWN.

583
00:18:37,955 --> 00:18:38,890
NORMALLY, I WOULD NEVER BELIEVE

584
00:18:38,890 --> 00:18:40,892
A STORY LIKE THAT, BUT FOR

585
00:18:40,892 --> 00:18:42,827
SOME REASON, SITTING THERE WITH

586
00:18:42,827 --> 00:18:45,396
HER, I FELT LIKE I COULD.

587
00:18:45,396 --> 00:18:46,697
>> SO, ARE YOU FRIENDS WITH THIS

588
00:18:46,697 --> 00:18:47,631

589
00:18:47,631 --> 00:18:48,465
>> NO.

590

ACTUALLY, YESTERDAY WAS THE

591
00:18:49,666 --> 00:18:51,001
FIRST TIME THAT I EVER MET HER.

592
00:18:51,001 --> 00:18:52,002
I ASKED HER A LOT OF

593
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:53,704
QUESTIONS, BUT SHE TOLD ME

594
00:18:53,704 --> 00:18:54,905
THAT SHE’D LOST ALL HER

595
00:18:54,905 --> 00:18:57,007
