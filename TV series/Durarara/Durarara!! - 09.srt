AS A CHILD.

93
00:04:58,584 --> 00:05:00,019
THE ONES HE LIKED AND SENT THEM

94
00:05:00,019 --> 00:05:01,020

WHAT I WOULD LIKE.

THAT HOUSE WAS SO BIG AND EMPTY.

104
00:05:25,981 --> 00:05:28,017
AND SO OFTEN, SEIJI AND I WERE

105
00:05:28,017 --> 00:05:29,985
THE ONLY ONES THERE.

106
00:05:29,985 --> 00:05:30,986
MY PARENTS FREQUENTLY SENT ME TO

107
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:32,988
MY UNCLE’S PLACE, EVEN BEFORE MY

108
00:05:32,988 --> 00:05:34,090
BROTHER WAS BORN.

109
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:36,059
I LOVED HAVING FREE REIGN OF HIS

110
00:05:36,059 --> 00:05:41,098
STUDY.

111
00:05:41,098 --> 00:05:45,870
AND THAT’S WHERE I FOUND IT.

112
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:46,804
I’D BEEN TOLD THAT IT WAS

113
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:47,939
SMUGGLED IN FROM SOME FOREIGN

114

00:05:49,674 --> 00:05:51,844
MY UNCLE SEEMED POSSESSED BY IT.

116
00:05:51,844 --> 00:05:53,145
SOMETIMES HE WOULD EVEN SPEAK TO

117
00:05:53,145 --> 00:05:56,048
IT.

118
00:05:56,048 --> 00:05:58,084
IT WAS INDEED BEAUTIFUL.

119
00:05:58,084 --> 00:05:59,785
FAR MORE THAN ANY DOLL MY UNCLE

120
00:05:59,785 --> 00:06:01,788
HAD GIVEN ME.

121
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:03,056
ODDLY ENOUGH, THERE WAS NO SENSE

122
00:06:03,056 --> 00:06:04,791
OF BRUTALITY TO IT.

123
00:06:04,791 --> 00:06:06,160
AS IF THE HEAD WAS COMPLETE,

124
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,764
JUST AS IT WAS.

125
00:06:09,764 --> 00:06:10,865
BUT IT WAS NEVER ANYTHING MORE

126
00:06:10,865 --> 00:06:14,669
TO ME.

127
00:06:14,669 --> 00:06:15,803
THAT’S WHY I DIDN’T THINK TWICE

128
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:17,038
ABOUT ALLOWING SEIJI INTO THE

129

130
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,141
IT WAS HARMLESS, JUST PART OF

OUR USUAL PLAY.

132
00:06:21,843 --> 00:06:23,945
OR MAYBE, I JUST WANTED TO SHARE

133
00:06:23,945 --> 00:06:26,448
THE SECRET.

134
00:06:26,448 --> 00:06:28,084

MY HEART BURNS WITH JEALOUSY,

>> SISTER, THERE’S A GIRL THAT I

REALLY LIKE.

249
00:09:51,645 --> 00:09:52,846

GROWING ODDER AND ODDER BY THE

DAY.

252
00:09:55,216 --> 00:09:56,751
HE KEPT TRYING TO SNEAK INTO MY

253
00:09:56,751 --> 00:09:58,953
UNCLE’S STUDY, AND ONCE HE WAS

254
00:09:58,953 --> 00:10:00,855
IN, HE WOULD STARE AT IT FOR

255
00:10:00,855 --> 00:10:02,757
HOURS.

256
00:10:02,757 --> 00:10:05,193
WHAT HE LOVED WAS NOT A PERSON.

257
00:10:05,193 --> 00:10:06,962
IT HAD NO HEART, NOT EVEN A

258
00:10:06,962 --> 00:10:09,298
BODY.

HIM.

262
00:10:17,006 --> 00:10:18,107
SO AS SOON AS I JOINED THE

263
00:10:18,107 --> 00:10:20,277
COMPANY, I ASKED MY UNCLE TO

264
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:21,946
RELOCATE IT THERE FOR RESEARCH

265

266
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:29,420
AND THEN IT HAPPENED.

267
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,122
NEBRA HAD BEGUN TALKS WITH OUR

FROM LEAKS.

00:10:35,194 --> 00:10:36,395
BUT THEN A SECURITY CARD WAS

STOLEN.

273
00:10:38,730 --> 00:10:40,099
IT WAS A CARD THAT ONLY I HAD

00:18:47,945 --> 00:18:49,379
>> I HAVE TO GO.

518
00:18:49,379 --> 00:18:50,314
>> YOU MUST HAVE BEEN SO SCARED.

519
00:18:50,314 --> 00:18:51,015
>> I HAVE TO GO.

520
00:18:51,015 --> 00:18:52,250
>> BUT AS YOU CAN SEE, NOTHING

521
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:53,251
HAPPENED TO YOU.

522
00:18:53,251 --> 00:18:54,018
EVEN AFTER SHE ESCAPED FROM HERE

523
00:18:54,018 --> 00:18:55,887
AND FOUND SEIJI AGAIN, MY LOVE

524
00:18:55,887 --> 00:18:58,624
FOR HIM NEVER WAIVERED.

525
00:18:58,624 --> 00:19:00,392
NOT ONCE.

526
00:19:00,392 --> 00:19:01,860
IT IS ONLY BECAUSE OF MY LOVE

527
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,029
FOR SEIJI THAT HE HAS ANY LOVE

528
00:19:03,029 --> 00:19:04,964
FOR THAT GIRL.

529
00:19:04,964 --> 00:19:06,365
SEIJI KNOWS THIS TO BE TRUE, AND

530
00:19:06,365 --> 00:19:08,335
SO DO I.

531
00:19:08,335 --> 00:19:09,269
EVERYTHING MAY HAVE GOTTEN A BIT

532
00:19:09,269 --> 00:19:10,937
TWISTED, BUT IT WILL STILL WORK

533
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:11,972
OUT.

534
00:19:11,972 --> 00:19:13,273
>> DAMN IT.

535
00:19:13,273 --> 00:19:16,009
HE WAS WEARING A RAIRA UNIFORM.

536
00:19:16,009 --> 00:19:17,911
SO THEN, WHO IS HE?

537
00:19:17,911 --> 00:19:19,813
>> JUST LEAVE IT TO ME.

538
00:19:19,813 --> 00:19:21,415
I’LL FIND HIM.

539
00:19:21,415 --> 00:19:23,017
>> WHAT I HAVE TO DO NOW IS FIND

540
00:19:23,017 --> 00:19:24,352
THAT KID FROM RAIRA.

541
00:19:24,352 --> 00:19:25,754
THEN I NEED TO BE ABLE TO TALK

542
00:19:25,754 --> 00:19:26,821
TO MY HEAD.

543
00:19:26,821 --> 00:19:27,922
>> DO YOU MEAN THE HEAD THAT

544
00:19:27,922 --> 00:19:32,294
SHRIEKED WHEN IT FIRST SAW YOU?

545
00:19:32,294 --> 00:19:32,995
HOW DO YOU INTEND TO GET YOUR

546
00:19:32,995 --> 00:19:34,664
HEAD BACK ANYWAY?

547
00:19:34,664 --> 00:19:36,732
IT’S ATTACHED TO ANOTHER BODY.

548
00:19:36,732 --> 00:19:37,968
WHAT’S YOUR PLAN?

549
00:19:37,968 --> 00:19:39,035
DO YOU THINK SHE’LL JUST SNAP

550
00:19:39,035 --> 00:19:42,373
OFF HER HEAD AND GIVE IT TO YOU?

551
00:19:42,373 --> 00:19:44,308
>> [sighs]

552
00:19:44,308 --> 00:19:47,411
>> CELTY...

553
00:19:47,411 --> 00:19:48,946
>> I JUST DON’T WANT TO ACCEPT

554
00:19:48,946 --> 00:19:50,347
THAT MY HEAD AND MY MEMORIES ARE

555
00:19:50,347 --> 00:19:51,583
GONE FOR GOOD.

556
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:52,584
THAT MEANS EVERYTHING I’VE DONE

557
00:19:52,584 --> 00:19:54,552
FOR THE PAST 20 YEARS HAS BEEN

558
00:19:54,552 --> 00:19:59,525
A COMPLETE WASTE OF TIME.

559
00:19:59,525 --> 00:20:01,594
>> IT WASN’T A WASTE OF TIME.

560
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:02,929
>> ALL RIGHT, I’M GOING TO GO

561
00:20:02,929 --> 00:20:04,030
GET HER NOW AND BRING HER BACK

562
00:20:04,030 --> 00:20:05,364
FOR YOU.

563
00:20:05,364 --> 00:20:06,032
YOU JUST STAY HERE UNTIL I

564
00:20:06,032 --> 00:20:11,071
RETURN.

565
00:20:11,071 --> 00:20:12,539
BY THE WAY.

566
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,377
YOUR CELL PHONE--WHERE IS IT?

567
00:20:16,377 --> 00:20:17,478
>> I DON’T KNOW.

568
00:20:17,478 --> 00:20:18,879
I REMEMBER PUTTING IT IN MY BAG,

569
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,982
BUT IT’S GONE NOW.

570
00:20:20,982 --> 00:20:22,117
>> HUH?

571
00:20:22,117 --> 00:20:23,418
>> SHE NEEDS ME.

572
00:20:23,418 --> 00:20:25,053
I HAVE TO FIND HER!

573
00:20:25,053 --> 00:20:27,356
WE ARE MEANT TO BE TOGETHER.

574
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:29,992
>> AH...I HEAR YOU.

575
00:20:29,992 --> 00:20:31,694
DON’T WORRY, NOW.

576
00:20:31,694 --> 00:20:36,433
YOU JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME.

577
00:20:36,433 --> 00:20:38,636
[sighs]

578
00:20:38,636 --> 00:20:43,006
THAT GIRL’S GOT NERVE.

579
00:20:43,006 --> 00:20:44,375
A DOLL SHOULD BEHAVE LIKE A DOLL

580
00:20:44,375 --> 00:20:46,077
AND STAY PUT.

581
00:20:46,077 --> 00:20:47,111
THE LAST THING IT SHOULD DO IS

582
00:20:47,111 --> 00:20:48,713
INTERFERE WITH MY LOVE FOR

583
00:20:48,713 --> 00:20:51,150
SEIJI.

584
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,952
I’VE MADE UP MY MIND.

585
00:20:52,952 --> 00:20:54,619
I DON’T WANT ANY MORE REGRETS.

586
00:20:54,619 --> 00:20:57,757
I’M THROUGH WITH THAT.

587
00:20:57,757 --> 00:20:58,758
OKAY, LISTEN.

588
00:20:58,758 --> 00:20:59,725
I WANT YOU TO ROUND UP EVERY

589
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:01,494
PERSON WE HAVE FOR THIS.

590
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:04,064
I WANT HER DEAD OR ALIVE.

591
00:21:04,064 --> 00:21:05,431
IF YOU HAVE ANY TROUBLE BRINGING

592
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:07,033
HER BACK, THEN DISPOSE OF HER.

593
00:21:13,107 --> 00:21:16,444
>> [sighs]

594
00:21:28,124 --> 00:21:33,163
>> [laughs]

595
00:21:33,163 --> 00:21:34,698
I SEE.

596
00:21:34,698 --> 00:21:36,166
EVERYONE IS BUSY.

597
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:37,835
THIS’LL BE FUN.

598
00:21:37,835 --> 00:21:39,704
THIS’LL BE FUN, THIS’LL BE FUN.

599
00:21:39,704 --> 00:21:40,705
THERE’S JUST SO MUCH GOING ON IN

600
00:21:40,705 --> 00:21:41,706
THIS TOWN THAT EVEN I DON’T KNOW

601
00:21:41,706 --> 00:21:43,909
ANYTHING ABOUT.

602
00:21:43,909 --> 00:21:44,810
IT’S AN ENDLESS SEA OF

603
00:21:44,810 --> 00:21:46,144
ENTERTAINMENT.

604
00:21:46,144 --> 00:21:47,813
THIS IS WHY I LOVE THIS BUSTLING

605
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:49,448
HOTBED OF HUMANS.

606
00:21:49,448 --> 00:21:50,616
I LOVE THEM.

607
00:21:50,616 --> 00:21:52,084
I LOVE THEM ALL.

608
00:21:52,084 --> 00:21:54,186
I LOVE THEM ALL SO MUCH!

609
00:21:54,186 --> 00:21:58,525
AND THAT IS WHY MY LOVELY LITTLE

610
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,028
HUMANS SHOULD LOVE AND ADORE ME

611
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:04,064
TOO.

612
00:22:09,737 --> 00:22:10,872
>> THANKS A LOT.

613
00:22:10,872 --> 00:22:12,240
>> ARE YOU OKAY NOW?

614
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,476
CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTIONS?

615
00:22:14,476 --> 00:22:15,644
>> MM...

616
00:22:15,644 --> 00:22:17,179
>> YOU SAID YOU DON’T REMEMBER

617
00:22:17,179 --> 00:22:19,915
ANYTHING.

618
00:22:19,915 --> 00:22:21,617
SO THEN, DO YOU THINK MAYBE YOU

619
00:22:21,617 --> 00:22:25,922
HAVE AMNESIA?

620
00:22:25,922 --> 00:22:27,557
WELL, I’M GONNA SUGGEST IT

621
00:22:27,557 --> 00:22:28,524
AGAIN.

622
00:22:28,524 --> 00:22:29,726
I THINK WE SHOULD GO TO THE

623
00:22:29,726 --> 00:22:32,496
POLICE, OR TO A HOSPITAL.

624
00:22:32,496 --> 00:22:36,100
