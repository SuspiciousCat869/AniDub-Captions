00:06:58,660 --> 00:06:59,761
THAT TOTALLY EXPLAINS WHY YOU

175
00:06:59,761 --> 00:07:02,297
WERE ACTING THAT WAY, RIGHT?

176
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:04,099
YOU JUST COULDN’T HELP IT.

177
00:07:04,099 --> 00:07:06,201
>> I’M SORRY, I’M SO SORRY.

179
00:07:08,336 --> 00:07:10,204
YOU APOLOGIZE TOO MUCH.

180

>> BY THE WAY, SAIKA, HAVE YOU

181
00:07:11,271 --> 00:07:12,740
EVER HEARD OF A GANG CALLED THE

182
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:15,075
YELLOW SCARVES?

183
00:07:15,075 --> 00:07:16,343
>> YOU MEAN THOSE GUYS I SEE

184
00:07:16,343 --> 00:07:18,312
WEARING YELLOW BANDANAS?

185
00:07:18,312 --> 00:07:20,213
>> THAT’S THEM EXACTLY.

186
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:21,280
THERE’S ANOTHER GROUP OUT THERE

187
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,381
THAT’S KINDA SIMILAR TO THEM

188
00:07:22,381 --> 00:07:24,383
CALLED THE DOLLARS.

189
00:07:24,383 --> 00:07:25,651
AND NOW BECAUSE OF THAT WHOLE

190
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:26,719
SLASHER THING THAT WAS

191
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,421
TERRIFYING EVERYONE,

192
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:29,722
THOSE TWO GANGS ARE FEELING SOME

193
00:07:29,722 --> 00:07:31,857
SERIOUS TENSIONS.

194
00:07:31,857 --> 00:07:33,259
>> UM...

195
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:37,029
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

196
00:07:37,029 --> 00:07:38,096
>> LET’S CHANGE THE SUBJECT,

197
00:07:38,096 --> 00:07:38,997
KANRA.

198
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,098
THAT MAYBE ISN’T THE BEST TOPIC

199
00:07:40,098 --> 00:07:42,200
FOR SOMEONE WHO’S A NEWBIE.

200
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,235
>> I DISAGREE.

201
00:07:43,235 --> 00:07:44,702
IF YOU LIVE IN IKEBUKURO, YOU

202
00:07:44,702 --> 00:07:46,237
SHOULD KNOW THIS.

203
00:07:46,237 --> 00:07:47,705
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT. THE

204
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:49,774
SLASHER’S STILL OUT THERE.

205
00:07:49,774 --> 00:07:51,876
THEY NEVER CAUGHT HIM, RIGHT?

206
00:07:51,876 --> 00:07:52,977
BOTH THE DOLLARS AND THE YELLOW

207
00:07:52,977 --> 00:07:54,078
SCARVES HAVE PEOPLE IN THEIR

208
00:07:54,078 --> 00:07:56,313
GANG WHO GOT HIT.

209
00:07:56,313 --> 00:07:57,681
AND EACH SIDE IS ABSOLUTELY

210
00:07:57,681 --> 00:07:58,782
CONVINCED THAT THE OTHER GROUP

211
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,251
IS BEHIND IT ALL.

00:08:05,088 --> 00:08:06,356
MAKING THAT BIG OF A DEAL ABOUT

00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:07,990
IT.

216
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:09,092
NEITHER SIDE REALLY KNOWS EACH

217
00:08:09,092 --> 00:08:10,159
OTHER, SO THAT’S CREATING

218
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,294
CONFUSION.

219
00:08:12,294 --> 00:08:13,328
>> DOESN’T MATTER.

220
00:08:13,328 --> 00:08:14,764
IF THE TWO OF THEM DON’T TAKE

221
00:08:14,764 --> 00:08:15,865
MATTERS INTO THEIR OWN HANDS AND

222
00:08:15,865 --> 00:08:16,966
FIND OUT WHO THE SLASHER REALLY

223
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:18,067
IS, THEN ALL HELL’S GONNA BREAK

224
00:08:18,067 --> 00:08:20,969
LOOSE IN IKEBUKURO.

225
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,171
>> SCARY STUFF.

226
00:08:22,171 --> 00:08:24,172
THIS COULD BE A REAL GANG WAR.

227
00:08:30,078 --> 00:08:32,280
>> DON’T WORRY, ANRI, IT’S OKAY.

228
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:33,381
IT’S NOT YOUR FAULT THOSE GANGS

229
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:35,849
ARE OUT OF CONTROL.

230
00:08:35,849 --> 00:08:36,850
YOU WEREN’T THE ONE WHO DID ALL

231
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:37,785
THOSE ATTACKS.

232
00:08:37,785 --> 00:08:38,752
THERE’S NO REASON TO TURN

233
00:08:38,752 --> 00:08:40,020
YOURSELF IN.

234
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:41,889
DON’T DO ANYTHING RASH.

235
00:08:41,889 --> 00:08:42,990
THE COPS HAVE BEEN PRETTY SCARY

236
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:44,992
LATELY.

237
00:08:44,992 --> 00:08:46,859
I MEAN, REALLY SCARY.

238
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:48,195
THEY’RE JUST PLAIN FRIGHTENING!

239
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:52,031
LIKE THOSE BIKE COPS.

240
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:55,067
>> OH, OKAY, THANKS FOR THE TIP.

241
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,203
>> HUH?

242
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:58,304

OH, RIGHT.

244
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,873
NEXT TIME, I’LL TEACH YOU HOW TO

245
00:09:01,873 --> 00:09:05,110
USE THE PRIVATE MESSAGE MODE.

246
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,377
>> SORRY, BUT I REALLY HAVE TO

247
00:09:06,377 --> 00:09:08,146
GET GOING NOW.

248
00:09:08,146 --> 00:09:09,114

516
00:17:57,300 --> 00:18:01,971
SOME OF THEM MIGHT DIE.

517
00:18:01,971 --> 00:18:03,272
WHY IS THAT?

518
00:18:03,272 --> 00:18:04,573
WHY DO TIMES LIKE THIS MAKE ME

519
00:18:04,573 --> 00:18:10,345
WANT TO SEE SAKI?

520
00:18:10,345 --> 00:18:11,446
>> "THE BLUE SKY IS DEAD,

521
00:18:11,446 --> 00:18:14,349
MEANING EVERYTHING IS FALLING"

522
00:18:14,349 --> 00:18:15,783
READ THE BANNER WHEN THE ARMY OF

523
00:18:15,783 --> 00:18:17,252
THE YELLOW SCARVES ROSE IN THE

524
00:18:17,252 --> 00:18:19,294
STORY OF THE THREE KINGDOMS.

525
00:18:23,257 --> 00:18:25,927
>> THE SKY AIN’T BLUE YET.

526
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:27,028
THEN AGAIN, IT ISN’T YELLOW

527
00:18:27,028 --> 00:18:28,495
EITHER.

528
00:18:31,031 --> 00:18:32,733
>> GOOD EVENING.

529
00:18:32,733 --> 00:18:34,768
OH, JUST YOU, TARO?

530
00:18:34,768 --> 00:18:35,802
>> HEY, THERE.

531
00:18:35,802 --> 00:18:36,903
YEAH, I GUESS.

532
00:18:36,903 --> 00:18:37,971
>> STRAIGHT TO PRIVATE MESSAGE,

533
00:18:37,971 --> 00:18:39,605
HUH?

534
00:18:39,605 --> 00:18:40,706
>> THERE’S SOMETHING I NEED TO

535
00:18:40,706 --> 00:18:41,707
ASK YOU.

536
00:18:41,707 --> 00:18:42,808
UM, HAVE THE YELLOW SCARVES BEEN

537
00:18:42,808 --> 00:18:46,011
IN IKEBUKURO FOR A WHILE NOW?

538
00:18:46,011 --> 00:18:47,312
>> WELL, FOR ABOUT THREE YEARS

539
00:18:47,312 --> 00:18:48,614
OR SO.

540
00:18:48,614 --> 00:18:49,882
AT FIRST, THEY WERE A QUIET

541
00:18:49,882 --> 00:18:53,818
LITTLE GROUP.

542
00:18:53,818 --> 00:18:54,886
>> THE BOY WHO LED THE DOLLARS

543
00:18:54,886 --> 00:18:55,987
LEARNED OF THE HORRIBLE FIGHT

544
00:18:55,987 --> 00:18:57,289
BETWEEN THE YELLOW SCARVES AND

545
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,991
THE BLUE SQUARES,

546
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:01,059
NEVER KNOWING THE GIRL

547
00:19:01,059 --> 00:19:02,393
SACRIFICED WAS THE FORMER

548
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:05,964
GIRLFRIEND OF HIS BEST FRIEND.

549
00:19:05,964 --> 00:19:07,065
AND UNAWARE THAT THE PERSON

550
00:19:07,065 --> 00:19:08,332
TELLING HIM THIS WAS THE SAME

551
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:09,433
MAN WHO CONTROLLED THAT GIRL’S

552
00:19:09,433 --> 00:19:10,501
MIND, AND HAD PERMANENTLY

553
00:19:10,501 --> 00:19:14,905
SCARRED HIS BEST FRIEND.

554
00:19:14,905 --> 00:19:15,973
>> SO THE ONLY ONES LEFT WERE

555
00:19:15,973 --> 00:19:17,340
THE YELLOW SCARVES.

556
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,075
>> NOT REALLY.

557
00:19:18,075 --> 00:19:19,076
THE BLUE SQUARES DIDN’T ACTUALLY

558
00:19:19,076 --> 00:19:21,811
GO AWAY.

559
00:19:21,811 --> 00:19:23,079
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

560
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,381
>> THE LEADER OF THE YELLOW

561
00:19:24,381 --> 00:19:25,482
SCARVES GOT SICK OF FIGHTING AND

562
00:19:25,482 --> 00:19:26,015
LEFT.

563
00:19:26,015 --> 00:19:27,917
AND THEN AFTER HE WAS GONE,

564
00:19:27,917 --> 00:19:29,018
MOST OF THE BLUE SQUARES JOINED

565
00:19:29,018 --> 00:19:30,619
THE YELLOW SCARVES.

566
00:19:30,619 --> 00:19:31,687
>> SO BASICALLY THEY JUST

567
00:19:31,687 --> 00:19:32,988
MERGED?

568
00:19:32,988 --> 00:19:34,990
>> YEAH, BASICALLY.

569
00:19:34,990 --> 00:19:36,057
WITH THE LEADER GONE, NO ONE WAS

570
00:19:36,057 --> 00:19:37,325
REALLY CHECKING WHERE PEOPLE

571
00:19:37,325 --> 00:19:38,827
CAME FROM ANYMORE.

572
00:19:38,827 --> 00:19:40,095
SO NOBODY KNEW IF YOU WERE

573
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:40,996
PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE OTHER

574
00:19:40,996 --> 00:19:42,563
GROUP.

575
00:19:42,563 --> 00:19:43,831
ALL SOMEONE HAD TO DO WAS REMOVE

576
00:19:43,831 --> 00:19:45,100
THEIR BLUE AND SAY THAT THEY

577
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,034
WANTED TO JOIN.

578
00:19:47,034 --> 00:19:49,570
THAT WAS IT.

579
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:51,105
>> AND SO THE GUY WHO QUIT,

580
00:19:51,105 --> 00:19:51,839
THE LEADER...

581
00:19:51,839 --> 00:19:53,107
>> I WOULD IMAGINE HE HAS NO

582
00:19:53,107 --> 00:19:54,008
IDEA THAT THE GUYS RESPONSIBLE

583
00:19:54,008 --> 00:19:55,109
FOR SENDING HIS OLD GIRLFRIEND

584
00:19:55,109 --> 00:19:56,743
TO THE HOSPITAL ARE NOW IN HIS

585
00:19:56,743 --> 00:19:59,579
OWN GANG.

586
00:19:59,579 --> 00:20:01,080
>> [gasps]

587
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,649
>> YOU SHOULD BE CAREFUL, TOO.

588
00:20:02,649 --> 00:20:03,917
IT SEEMS THE DOLLARS HAVE A FEW

589
00:20:03,917 --> 00:20:05,018
YELLOW SCARVES AMONGST THEM AS

590
00:20:05,018 --> 00:20:06,920
WELL.

591
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:08,021
>> YEAH, BUT THAT MIGHT WORK IN

592
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:08,854
MY FAVOR.

593
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:10,089
IF I SPREAD WORD THAT THE

594
00:20:10,089 --> 00:20:11,023
DOLLARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH

595
00:20:11,023 --> 00:20:12,125
THE SLASHER, THEN THAT MIGHT GET

596
00:20:12,125 --> 00:20:15,127
PASSED ON TO THE YELLOW SCARVES.

597
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:16,061
>> PROVIDING THE DOLLARS REALLY

598
00:20:16,061 --> 00:20:19,131
WEREN’T INVOLVED.

599
00:20:19,131 --> 00:20:20,432
THE DOLLARS DON’T HAVE ANY

600
00:20:20,432 --> 00:20:21,699
RULES, AND YOU DON’T KEEP ANY

601
00:20:21,699 --> 00:20:25,002
EYE ON EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

602
00:20:25,002 --> 00:20:27,004
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT...

603
00:20:27,004 --> 00:20:28,072
SOME GUYS IN THE DOLLARS COULD

604
00:20:28,072 --> 00:20:29,373
BE WORKING WITH THE SLASHER

605
00:20:29,373 --> 00:20:32,910
WITHOUT YOU KNOWING.

606
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:34,011
AFTER ALL, THAT’S HOW THE

607
00:20:34,011 --> 00:20:35,679
DOLLARS WORK.

608
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:36,780
IF YOU’RE GOING TO GET YOURSELF

REALLY GIVE ME A REASON WHY.

THAT HE WAS ACTUALLY JUST A

656
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:59,690
STRANGER IN HIS OWN SKIN.

657
00:21:59,690 --> 00:22:01,158
