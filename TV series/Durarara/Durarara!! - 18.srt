133
00:05:29,768 --> 00:05:31,435
IF SHE WERE TO DIE?

134
00:05:31,435 --> 00:05:32,802

IF SHE LIVES OR DIES,

140

I PERSONALLY DON’T BELIEVE

IN GOD.

156
00:06:02,944 --> 00:06:03,911
THERE’S NO REAL PROOF THAT HE

AND DELUSIONS.

164
00:06:14,747 --> 00:06:15,914
BUT IF A PERSON BELIEVES IT

165
00:06:15,914 --> 00:06:17,881
TO BE TRUE, THEN THE TRUTH

166
00:06:17,881 --> 00:06:19,881
IS WHAT IT BECOMES.

167
00:06:19,881 --> 00:06:21,149
NOW IF YOU SUCCUMB TO THIS POINT

168
00:06:21,149 --> 00:06:22,216
OF VIEW AND MODEL YOUR ACTIONS

169
00:06:22,216 --> 00:06:24,850
BASED ON YOUR OWN PAST,

170
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,950
WELL, THEN YOUR PAST ITSELF

171
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,017
BECOMES SORT OF GOD-LIKE,

DOESN’T IT?

173
00:06:28,551 --> 00:06:29,818
>> I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU’RE

174
00:06:29,818 --> 00:06:31,019
TRYING TO SAY.

175
00:06:31,019 --> 00:06:32,752
>> OH, I THINK YOU DO.

176
00:06:32,752 --> 00:06:34,019
YOU’LL NEVER BE ABLE TO ESCAPE

177
00:06:34,019 --> 00:06:35,153
THIS GIRL.

178
00:06:35,153 --> 00:06:36,453
YOUR GUILT WILL BECOME YOUR PAST

179
00:06:36,453 --> 00:06:40,654
AND SHE WILL BECOME YOUR GOD.

180
00:06:40,654 --> 00:06:42,722
BUT WHAT’S SO WRONG WITH THAT?

181
00:06:42,722 --> 00:06:44,122
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, YOU DO LOVE

182
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:49,657
HER.

183

THE SEXINESS PART!

197
00:07:09,062 --> 00:07:09,995
>> YEAH, I AGREE, EXCEPT FOR THE

198
00:07:09,995 --> 00:07:11,163
SEXY PART.

201
00:07:15,131 --> 00:07:16,064
GOTCHA, OKAY, I’LL BE RIGHT

202
00:07:16,064 --> 00:07:17,131
THERE.

203
00:07:17,131 --> 00:07:18,698
HANG TIGHT.

204
00:07:18,698 --> 00:07:20,132
SORRY, HAVE TO SPLIT.

205
00:07:20,132 --> 00:07:21,799
I GOT A FRIEND IN NEED.

206
00:07:21,799 --> 00:07:23,166
>> WHAT, YOU’RE LEAVING?

207
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,233
>> HEY, IF YOU NEED TO BLAME

208
00:07:24,233 --> 00:07:25,534
SOMEONE, BLAME MY FRIEND ALL YOU

209
00:07:25,534 --> 00:07:26,800
WANT. BLAMING A PERSON IS FREE

210
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,601
AND IT CAUSES ME NO HARM.

211
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:30,868
IT’S JUST LIKE TWO WIVES FOR ONE

>> DON’T YOU THINK MASAOMI’S

219
00:07:42,471 --> 00:07:43,572
BEEN ACTING KIND OF WEIRD

220
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,005
LATELY?

221
00:07:45,005 --> 00:07:46,239
>> HUH, REALLY?

222
00:07:46,239 --> 00:07:50,006
MAYBE YOU’RE OVERTHINKING IT.

223
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:51,107
>> I NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THE

224
00:07:51,107 --> 00:07:53,908
YELLOW SCARVES TO MIKADO.

225
00:07:53,908 --> 00:07:55,142
MY LIFE WITH THESE GUYS AND MY

226
00:07:55,142 --> 00:07:56,608
LIFE WITH MIKADO ARE BOTH VERY

227
00:07:56,608 --> 00:07:58,543
REAL TO ME.

228
00:07:58,543 --> 00:07:59,809
BUT IN MY MIND, IT’S LIKE

229
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,210
THEY’RE WORLDS APART.

230
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:04,678
WE WOULD SPEND OUR WHOLE DAY

231
00:08:04,678 --> 00:08:06,111
FIGHTING.

232
00:08:06,111 --> 00:08:07,045
THAT WAS THE ONLY CONNECTION WE

233
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:09,512
HAD WITH EACH OTHER.

234
00:08:09,512 --> 00:08:10,779
ALL I REALLY WANTED WAS FOR

235
00:08:10,779 --> 00:08:13,047
SOMEONE TO ACCEPT ME.

236
00:08:13,047 --> 00:08:14,513
AND THAT’S WHEN I FIRST MET

237
00:08:14,513 --> 00:08:16,948
SAKI.

238
00:08:16,948 --> 00:08:18,014
>> THAT YELLOW SCARF LOOKS GOOD

239
00:08:18,014 --> 00:08:19,782
ON YOU.

240
00:08:19,782 --> 00:08:20,582
>> HUH?

241
00:08:20,582 --> 00:08:21,682
>> YOU’RE MUCH COOLER THAN THE

242
00:08:21,682 --> 00:08:22,950
RUMORS MAKE YOU OUT TO BE,

243
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,950
MASAOMI KIDA.

244
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:27,017
>> WELL, NOW, HOW DID YOU KNOW

245
00:08:27,017 --> 00:08:28,817
WHAT MY NAME IS?

246
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,085
WHAT ARE YA, SOME KIND OF

247
00:08:30,085 --> 00:08:31,552
CLAIRVOYANT?

248
00:08:31,552 --> 00:08:32,652
IF YOU CAN REALLY READ PEOPLES’

249
00:08:32,652 --> 00:08:33,919
MINDS, THEN I’M GONNA PUT YOU IN

250
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:36,253
A BAG AND TAKE YOU HOME WITH ME.

251
00:08:36,253 --> 00:08:37,520
>> [giggling] OH, MY GOD, YOU’RE

252
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,187
SO SILLY.

253
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:40,487
SORRY, BUT IT WASN’T ME.

254
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:44,088
SOMEBODY ELSE HAS E.S.P.

255
00:08:44,088 --> 00:08:45,656
>> OH, YEAH, WHO IS IT?

256
00:08:45,656 --> 00:08:46,922
ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS HAVE A SIXTH

257
00:08:46,922 --> 00:08:47,622
SENSE?

258
00:08:47,622 --> 00:08:48,890
>> NO, BUT THIS PERSON IS JUST

259
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:50,123
AMAZING.

260
00:08:50,123 --> 00:08:51,023
IT SEEMS LIKE HE KNOWS

261
00:08:51,023 --> 00:08:51,891
EVERYTHING.

262
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:52,558
>> HUH?

263
00:08:52,558 --> 00:08:53,824
THAT’S WHEN I FIRST MET THIS

264
00:08:53,824 --> 00:08:54,691
GUY.

265
00:08:54,691 --> 00:08:56,092
AND I SO WISH I HADN’T.

266
00:08:56,092 --> 00:08:57,192
>> WELL, HELLO THERE, HOW DO YOU

267
00:08:57,192 --> 00:08:58,192
DO?

268
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:00,760
YOUR NAME IS MASAOMI KIDA, ISN’T

269
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:01,793
IT?

270
00:09:01,793 --> 00:09:03,527
>> THAT’S RIGHT. WHO ARE YOU?

271
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:04,594
>> IZAYA ORIHARA.

272
00:09:04,594 --> 00:09:06,595
I’M AN INFORMATION BROKER.

273
00:09:06,595 --> 00:09:07,862
I’M SORT OF LIKE THIS GIRL’S

274

I JUST WANT YOU TO USE MY NAME,

283
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:25,967
MASAOMI, OKAY?

284
00:09:25,967 --> 00:09:27,033
>> Y-YEAH, SURE, BUT THAT SEEMS

285
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:29,201
KINDA WRONG.

286
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:30,834
WE CAN’T FIND OUT SQUAT ON THE

DOLLARS.

288
00:09:32,035 --> 00:09:33,669
SOME OF OUR GUYS USED TO BE

289
00:09:33,669 --> 00:09:34,936
MEMBERS, BUT EVEN THEY HAVE NO

290
00:09:34,936 --> 00:09:37,503
IDEA WHO THEIR LEADER IS.

291
00:09:37,503 --> 00:09:38,604

REVEAL HIMSELF WHEN THEY MET SIX

>> ARE THEY PLANNING ANYTHING?

295
00:09:44,205 --> 00:09:45,505
>> WELL, THE LEADER HAS SENT OUT

296
00:09:45,505 --> 00:09:46,573
A REQUEST ASKING FOR INFORMATION

297
00:09:46,573 --> 00:09:49,073
ON THE SLASHER.

298
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:50,140
MAYBE THEY AREN’T BEHIND

299
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,674
THE SLASHER ATTACKS.

300

SO, YOU KNOW...

318
00:10:17,847 --> 00:10:18,948
>> I WONDER WHO THIS BLACK RIDER

319
00:10:18,948 --> 00:10:20,882
PERSON REALLY IS.

ARE OLDER THAN ME, RIGHT?

325
00:10:27,584 --> 00:10:30,051
>> UH, YEAH.

00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,698
WORKED OUT OKAY.

354

BUT I DIDN’T TRUST HIM.

355
00:11:18,531 --> 00:11:19,965

IF YOU FEEL GUILTY ABOUT RUNNING

THAT’S THE LEAST YOU CAN DO TO

687
00:20:21,449 --> 00:20:23,249
MAKE IT UP TO THIS GIRL.

688
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:24,683
AND IF YOU DON’T WANNA LIE TO

689
00:20:24,683 --> 00:20:27,084
HER, THEN STOP RUNNING.

690
00:20:27,084 --> 00:20:28,351
IT’S TIME YOU FACE WHAT YOU’RE

691

AFRAID OF AND TELL HER THE

692

TRUTH.

693
00:20:31,318 --> 00:20:32,785
IF YOU WANNA RUN FROM YOUR PAST,

FINE.

695
00:20:34,753 --> 00:20:36,453
BUT WHATEVER YOU DO,

696
00:20:36,453 --> 00:20:37,719
DON’T RUN FROM THE PRESENT OR,

697

WE SHOULD BREAK UP.

709

I WAS LONELY.

717

AND WHEN I WAS TALKING WITH

718
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,297
MIKADO, I FELT BETTER.

TIGHT AGAIN.

722
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:20,831
I ALSO MET ANRI.
