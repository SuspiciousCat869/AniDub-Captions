00:05:45,253 --> 00:05:46,254
BUT REMEMBER, YOU’RE THE ONE

176
00:05:46,254 --> 00:05:47,255
WHO RAN AWAY

177
00:05:47,255 --> 00:05:48,290
FROM YOUR GIRLFRIEND.

178
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:50,058
UNLIKE DOTACHIN WHO ACTUALLY DID

179
00:05:50,058 --> 00:05:51,927
SOMETHING AND SAVED THE GIRL.

180
00:05:51,927 --> 00:05:53,129
SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO BRING UP

181
00:05:53,129 --> 00:05:54,130
THIS TOPIC AGAIN,

182
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:55,331
WE’LL HAVE NO CHOICE.

183
00:05:55,331 --> 00:05:57,100
WE’LL TREAT IT AS A DELUSION.

184
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:58,167
IF YOU MAKE FICTION

185
00:05:58,167 --> 00:05:59,969
JUST AS VALUABLE AS REALITY,

186
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:01,805
THEN ANY REALITY YOU DON’T NEED

187
00:06:01,805 --> 00:06:02,906
CAN BE A DELUSION.

188
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,942
THAT’S HOW WE DO IT.

189
00:06:04,942 --> 00:06:05,943
>> ACTUALLY, YOU’RE WRONG,

190
00:06:05,943 --> 00:06:06,944
ERIKA.

191
00:06:06,944 --> 00:06:07,945
>> WHAT? I AM?

192
00:06:07,945 --> 00:06:08,946
>> EVEN IF THERE REALLY

193
00:06:08,946 --> 00:06:09,947
WAS SOMETHING CALLED

194
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:11,382
"THE BLUE SQUARES"...

195
00:06:11,382 --> 00:06:12,750
IN OTHER EPISODES,

196
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,751
THE BLUE SQUARES WERE

197
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:14,986
THE FIRST ONES TO GET THE CRAP

198
00:06:14,986 --> 00:06:16,888
KICKED OUT OF THEM.

199
00:06:16,888 --> 00:06:18,056
BUT FOR SOME REASON,

200
00:06:18,056 --> 00:06:19,057
THEY’RE BEING PAINTED AS

201
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:20,058
THE ONLY BAD GUYS.

202
00:06:20,058 --> 00:06:21,360
THAT’S WHAT UPSET ME.

203
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,262
>> OH, NOW I GET IT!

204
00:06:23,262 --> 00:06:25,764
[whines] I’M SO EMBARRASSED.

205
00:06:25,764 --> 00:06:27,834
I TOTALLY SHOULD’VE SEEN THAT!

206
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,301
>> I APOLOGIZE.

207
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,037
YOU HAVE A POINT.

208
00:06:31,037 --> 00:06:32,104
>> NO, IT’S ALL GOOD.

209
00:06:32,104 --> 00:06:33,005
WE’RE THE ONES WHO SHOULD

210
00:06:33,005 --> 00:06:33,906
APOLOGIZE.

211
00:06:33,906 --> 00:06:35,442
WE DO HONESTLY FEEL BAD ABOUT

212
00:06:35,442 --> 00:06:36,443
WHAT HAPPENED TO SAKI.

213
00:06:36,443 --> 00:06:37,811
THAT WASN’T RIGHT.

214
00:06:37,811 --> 00:06:39,847
>> NO. WHAT I REALLY SHOULD DO

215
00:06:39,847 --> 00:06:41,214
IS THANK YOU GUYS FOR WHAT YOU

216
00:06:41,214 --> 00:06:42,850
DID.

217
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:44,185
>> LISTEN, YOU’VE GOT EVERY

218
00:06:44,185 --> 00:06:45,919
RIGHT TO HATE US.

219
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:47,956
WHAT OUR GUYS DID TO HER...

220
00:06:47,956 --> 00:06:48,923
IT WAS OUT OF CONTROL.

221
00:06:48,923 --> 00:06:49,924
SHE WAS JUST SOME MIDDLE-SCHOOL

222
00:06:49,924 --> 00:06:50,391
KID.

223
00:06:50,391 --> 00:06:51,926
>> BUT KYOHEI, IT WASN’T YOU

224
00:06:51,926 --> 00:06:52,427
WHO DID IT.

225
00:06:52,427 --> 00:06:53,227
IT WAS JUST--

226
00:06:53,227 --> 00:06:55,096
>> BUT I WAS STILL A PART OF IT.

227
00:06:55,096 --> 00:06:56,131
AND NO MATTER WHAT,

228
00:06:56,131 --> 00:06:57,832
YOU CAN NEVER ESCAPE THAT.

229
00:06:57,832 --> 00:06:58,901
>> [sighs]

230
00:06:58,901 --> 00:06:59,969
>> LET ME BE PERFECTLY CLEAR

231
00:06:59,969 --> 00:07:01,036
ABOUT THIS.

232
00:07:01,036 --> 00:07:02,705
SEE, I HAVE NO IDEA WHO

233
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:03,706
OUR BOSS IS, AND I HAVE

234
00:07:03,706 --> 00:07:05,841
NO DESIRE TO FIND OUT.

235
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:07,877
AND FOR THE VERY LAST TIME,

236
00:07:07,877 --> 00:07:08,979
THE DOLLARS HAVE NOTHING TO DO

237
00:07:08,979 --> 00:07:10,146
WITH THE SLASHER,

238
00:07:10,146 --> 00:07:11,181
AND NO REASON TO FIGHT

239
00:07:11,181 --> 00:07:12,348
THE YELLOW SCARVES.

240
00:07:12,348 --> 00:07:13,950
>> I HEAR YA.

241
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:15,252
>> YOU KNOW, THERE IS THIS GUY

242
00:07:15,252 --> 00:07:16,353
OUT THERE, AND HE SAYS

243
00:07:16,353 --> 00:07:17,354
HE KNOWS WHO THE LEADER

244
00:07:17,354 --> 00:07:18,389
OF THE DOLLARS IS.

245
00:07:18,389 --> 00:07:20,291
>> [gasps] WELL, WHO IS IT?

246
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,292
>> HOLD ON A SEC.

247
00:07:21,292 --> 00:07:22,459
JUST WHAT ARE YOU PLANNING TO DO

248
00:07:22,459 --> 00:07:24,361
ONCE YOU FIND OUT?

249
00:07:24,361 --> 00:07:25,763
LET’S SAY YOU DO LEARN WHO

250
00:07:25,763 --> 00:07:26,998
THE HEAD OF THE DOLLARS IS.

251
00:07:26,998 --> 00:07:28,033
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO

252
00:07:28,033 --> 00:07:29,034
AFTER THAT, SIT DOWN

253
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,068
AND HAVE A CUP OF TEA WITH HIM?

254
00:07:30,068 --> 00:07:31,069
OR ARE YOU GONNA GET

255
00:07:31,069 --> 00:07:32,404
THE YELLOW SCARVES TOGETHER

256
00:07:32,404 --> 00:07:33,839
AND AMBUSH HIM?

257
00:07:33,839 --> 00:07:35,307
>> ALL I WANT IS TO KNOW

258
00:07:35,307 --> 00:07:36,875
WHO THE SLASHER IS.

259
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,077
>> AND THE REST OF YOUR GUYS?

260
00:07:38,077 --> 00:07:39,979
THEY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT?

261
00:07:39,979 --> 00:07:40,914
>> [gasps]

262
00:07:40,914 --> 00:07:41,915
>> IF YOU HAD A FIRM HAND ON ’EM

263
00:07:41,915 --> 00:07:42,916
LIKE YOU ONCE DID,

264
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:43,983
THEN MAYBE I’D FEEL LIKE

265
00:07:43,983 --> 00:07:44,984
I COULD HELP YOU OUT

266
00:07:44,984 --> 00:07:46,886
AND TRUST YOU A BIT.

267
00:07:46,886 --> 00:07:47,987
BUT SINCE YOU’VE LEFT,

268
00:07:47,987 --> 00:07:48,988
THINGS HAVE CHANGED.

269
00:07:48,988 --> 00:07:50,290
YOUR GUYS DON’T ACT THE SAME WAY

270
00:07:50,290 --> 00:07:51,926
THEY ONCE DID.

271
00:07:51,926 --> 00:07:52,927
DON’T TELL ME YOU HAVEN’T

272
00:07:52,927 --> 00:07:54,895
NOTICED THIS.

273
00:07:54,895 --> 00:07:56,130
>> THEY’RE FINE.

274
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:57,332
I KNOW THOSE GUYS WELL.

275
00:07:57,332 --> 00:07:58,399
AND NO MATTER WHAT,

276
00:07:58,399 --> 00:07:59,400
I STILL THINK OF THEM

277
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,870
AS MY FRIENDS.

278
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:03,238
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO

279
00:08:03,238 --> 00:08:04,906
GO ABOUT THIS, DO YOU?

280
00:08:06,975 --> 00:08:08,244
LET’S SAY FOR A SECOND THAT

281
00:08:08,244 --> 00:08:09,778
THE DOLLARS ARE INVOLVED.

282
00:08:09,778 --> 00:08:11,080
WHAT’S THAT GOT TO DO WITH YOU?

283
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,148
ARE YOU EVEN A PART OF THIS

284
00:08:12,148 --> 00:08:13,215
ANYMORE?

285
00:08:13,215 --> 00:08:15,317
YOU ALWAYS HATED GANG WARS.

286
00:08:15,317 --> 00:08:16,819
THAT’S WHY YOU RAN AWAY BEFORE.

287
00:08:16,819 --> 00:08:17,820
>> I KNOW.

288
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,888
>> BUT SOMETIMES,

289
00:08:18,888 --> 00:08:20,056
THE REALITY YOU THOUGHT YOU’D

290
00:08:20,056 --> 00:08:21,558
GOTTEN RID OF COMES BACK

291
00:08:21,558 --> 00:08:23,126
IN A VERY TWISTED WAY.

292
00:08:23,126 --> 00:08:24,361
>> BUT THIS TIME, IT DOESN’T

293
00:08:24,361 --> 00:08:25,362
JUST INVOLVE MY FRIENDS

294
00:08:25,362 --> 00:08:26,897
IN THE YELLOW SCARVES.

295
00:08:26,897 --> 00:08:27,898
>> HUH?

296
00:08:27,898 --> 00:08:29,099
>> SOMEONE VERY IMPORTANT TO ME,

297
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:30,100
WHO HAS NOTHING TO DO

298
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,102
WITH MY PAST

299
00:08:31,102 --> 00:08:32,103
OR THE YELLOW SCARVES,

300
00:08:32,103 --> 00:08:33,104
WAS ATTACKED.

301
00:08:33,104 --> 00:08:34,105
AND I WON’T FORGIVE THAT.

302
00:08:34,105 --> 00:08:35,106
>> WELL, IT SOUNDS TO ME

303
00:08:35,106 --> 00:08:36,107
LIKE THAT’S YOUR--

304
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,476
>> YEAH, I KNOW.

305
00:08:37,476 --> 00:08:39,811
THAT’S MY PROBLEM.

306
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,380
JUST USING THE YELLOW SCARVES

307
00:08:41,380 --> 00:08:42,881
AS AN EXCUSE.

308
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:43,883
A WAY TO WORK THROUGH

309
00:08:43,883 --> 00:08:46,986
MY OWN ISSUES.

310
00:08:46,986 --> 00:08:48,521
>> WELL, IF YOU FIGURED THAT

311
00:08:48,521 --> 00:08:50,590
OUT, THEN I’LL LEAVE YOU ALONE.

312
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:51,991
GUESS THE REMAINING DECISIONS

313
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:52,993
WILL BE MADE BY THE GUY

314
00:08:52,993 --> 00:08:53,994
WHO KNOWS THE LEADER

315
00:08:53,994 --> 00:08:55,161
AND THE LEADER HIMSELF.

316
00:08:55,161 --> 00:08:56,162
>> [gasps]

317
00:08:56,162 --> 00:08:58,364
>> HOWEVER...

318
00:08:58,364 --> 00:08:59,866
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND

319
00:08:59,866 --> 00:09:00,934
AND DECIDE THAT THE DOLLARS

320
00:09:00,934 --> 00:09:03,370
ACTUALLY ARE YOUR ENEMY--

321
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:04,906
>> IF I WERE TO DO THAT,

322
00:09:04,906 --> 00:09:06,107
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN?

323
00:09:06,107 --> 00:09:07,308
>> IF YOU GUYS WANT A FIGHT,

324
00:09:07,308 --> 00:09:09,243
YOU’LL GET ONE.

325
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:11,579
YOU’RE PREPARED FOR THAT, RIGHT?

326
00:09:11,579 --> 00:09:12,847
’CAUSE IF YOU KEEP ON WAVING

327
00:09:12,847 --> 00:09:14,316
THIS FLAG OF VENGEANCE,

328
00:09:14,316 --> 00:09:15,617
JUST KNOW THAT THE BATTLES

329
00:09:15,617 --> 00:09:16,952
YOU’RE GONNA ENCOUNTER WILL BE

330
00:09:16,952 --> 00:09:18,353
WAY WORSE THAN THE LITTLE KIDDY

331
00:09:18,353 --> 00:09:22,558
FIGHTS YOU’VE SEEN BEFORE.

332

FIVE KREMLIN NIGIRI

339
00:09:37,975 --> 00:09:39,343
FOR MR. BOSS MAN.

340
00:09:39,343 --> 00:09:41,912
YOU FIGHT BECAUSE YOU’RE HUNGRY.

FULL OF DREAMS!

344
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:46,551
A MAN’S STOMACH IS

345
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:49,888
THE DREAM-MAKER.

346
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:50,889
MM.

347
00:09:50,889 --> 00:09:52,658
>> UH, TH-THANKS.

348
00:09:52,658 --> 00:09:54,193
THE FOOD LOOKS GREAT, SIMON.

349
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,963
>> Y-YEAH, IT LOOKS AWESOME.

350
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:57,964
>> HE’S WHACKED!

351
00:09:57,964 --> 00:09:59,999
THE OWNER’S WHACKED!

352
00:09:59,999 --> 00:10:01,467
>> HEY, ISN’T THIS WHAT PEOPLE

353
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,502
WOULD NORMALLY CALL

354
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:03,903
"ATTEMPTED MURDER"?

355
00:10:03,903 --> 00:10:05,938
>> [chuckles] I HAD NO IDEA

356
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:07,040
A KNIFE COULD GAUGE A WALL

357
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,575
LIKE THAT.

358
00:10:08,575 --> 00:10:11,044
[all chewing]

359
00:10:11,044 --> 00:10:13,581
[all yell]

360
00:10:13,581 --> 00:10:14,915
>> LATER, KIDA.

361
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,484
AND LISTEN, DON’T DO ANYTHING

362
00:10:16,484 --> 00:10:17,685
YOU’RE GONNA REGRET.

363
00:10:17,685 --> 00:10:18,920
>> MAN, THAT CHEF’S ONE SCARY

364
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,421
MOTHER.

365
00:10:20,421 --> 00:10:21,522
A FEW INCHES EITHER WAY,

366
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:22,991
AND ONE OF US WASN’T COMING OUT

367
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,025
OF THERE ALIVE.

368
00:10:24,025 --> 00:10:25,093
REALLY?

369
00:10:25,093 --> 00:10:25,994
I THOUGHT THAT GUY WAS PRETTY

370
00:10:25,994 --> 00:10:27,062
COOL.

371
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,130
>> ME, TOO!

372
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:29,431
I COULD SEE HIM THROWING DOWN

373
00:10:29,431 --> 00:10:31,000
COMBAT SAMBO STYLE WITH THE LEAD

374
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,602
OF SOME MANGA WHO’S LIKE A CHEF

375
00:10:32,602 --> 00:10:33,936
AND IS ALWAYS SAYIN’ PEOPLE

376
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:35,338
SHOULDN’T PLAY WITH KNIVES.

377
00:10:35,338 --> 00:10:36,972
SO IN OUR MINDS,

378
00:10:36,972 --> 00:10:38,208
THE CHEF BECAME A FORMER

379
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,275
MARTIAL ARTS INSTRUCTOR

380
00:10:39,275 --> 00:10:40,643
FOR THE RUSSIAN MILITARY WHO

381
00:10:40,643 --> 00:10:42,078
ONCE FOUGHT AGAINST THE MAFIA.

382
00:10:42,078 --> 00:10:43,079
AND NOW...

383
00:10:43,079 --> 00:10:44,080
THAT EXPLAINS WHY HE’S

384
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,081
PRETENDING TO BE A SUSHI CHEF!

385
00:10:45,081 --> 00:10:46,483
IT’S GENIUS!

386
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,484
>> DUDE, IF HE WERE,

387
00:10:47,484 --> 00:10:48,485
HE WOULDN’T OPEN A RESTAURANT

388
00:10:48,485 --> 00:10:51,355
AS OBVIOUS AS RUSSIA SUSHI.

389
00:10:51,355 --> 00:10:53,324
>> HORADA...HORADA...

390
00:10:53,324 --> 00:10:54,459
>> HEY, KYOHEI.

391
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:55,593
IS THAT SOME KIND OF SPELL

392
00:10:55,593 --> 00:10:56,594
YOU’RE CASTING?

393
00:10:56,594 --> 00:10:57,995
>> AND SO DOTACHIN BEGAN

394
00:10:57,995 --> 00:10:59,731
TO CHANT, "HO RADA RADA!"

395
00:10:59,731 --> 00:11:00,665
>> IS THAT THE CONTROLLING

396
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:01,733
OR THE SERVANT TYPE?

397
00:11:01,733 --> 00:11:03,736
>> OR MAYBE ELECTRIC-SHOCK TYPE!

398
00:11:03,736 --> 00:11:05,704
>> [sighs] REMEMBER WHAT

399
00:11:05,704 --> 00:11:07,205
MASAOMI SAID?

400
00:11:07,205 --> 00:11:08,407
I ALREADY TOLD YOU.

401
00:11:08,407 --> 00:11:09,408
LOOK INTO THE DOLLARS

402
00:11:09,408 --> 00:11:10,509
ALL YOU WANT, BUT YOU WON’T

403
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:12,478
FIND THE SLASHER AMONG US.

404
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:13,713
>> I’M SORRY...

405
00:11:13,713 --> 00:11:16,215
BUT I DISAGREE WITH YOU ON THIS.

406
00:11:16,215 --> 00:11:17,984
>> HOW COME?

407
00:11:17,984 --> 00:11:19,018
>> THERE’S A RUMOR THAT THE

408
00:11:19,018 --> 00:11:21,088
BLACK RIDER’S IN THE DOLLARS.

409
00:11:21,088 --> 00:11:22,456
>> HUH? WHY ARE WE TALKIN’

410
00:11:22,456 --> 00:11:24,124
ABOUT THE BLACK RIDER?

411
00:11:24,124 --> 00:11:25,560
>> BECAUSE LAST NIGHT,

412
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,663
WE SAW SOMETHING PRETTY UNREAL.

413
00:11:28,663 --> 00:11:29,597
>> I SEE.

414
00:11:29,597 --> 00:11:31,099
SO BECAUSE THE BLACK RIDER

415
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:32,100
HELPED SOMEONE WITH

416
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:33,501
A KATANA ESCAPE, THEY’RE WORKIN’

417
00:11:33,501 --> 00:11:35,036
WITH THE SLASHER?

418
00:11:35,036 --> 00:11:37,172
>> AND THIS GUY HORADA SAID

419
00:11:37,172 --> 00:11:38,173
HE WAS ATTACKED BY THE BLACK

420
00:11:38,173 --> 00:11:39,174
BLACK RIDER.

421
00:11:39,174 --> 00:11:41,643
>> HORADA?

422
00:11:41,643 --> 00:11:43,612
HORADA.

423
00:11:43,612 --> 00:11:44,613
>> SO THAT’S WHY YOU’RE

424
00:11:44,613 --> 00:11:46,182
MUMBLING THAT NAME.

425
00:11:46,182 --> 00:11:47,183
>> WHAT’S THE BIG DEAL

426
00:11:47,183 --> 00:11:49,519
ABOUT THIS HORADA GUY, ANYWAY?

427
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:50,287
>> I DON’T KNOW.

428
00:11:50,287 --> 00:11:51,554
IT MIGHT BE NOTHING.

429
00:11:51,554 --> 00:11:53,256
BUT IF I’M RIGHT, IT MIGHT BE

430
00:11:53,256 --> 00:11:55,058
SOMETHING.

431
00:11:55,058 --> 00:11:56,559
>> RIGHT ABOUT WHAT?

432
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,496
>> WELL, I’M NOT ENTIRELY

433
00:11:58,496 --> 00:12:00,498
POSITIVE, BUT I MIGHT HAVE KNOWN

434
00:12:00,498 --> 00:12:02,233
A GUY WITH THAT NAME ONCE.

435
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:06,170
>> IF YOU PUT IT TOGETHER...

436
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:07,171
THAT THERE’S A GROUP WITHIN

437
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:08,072
THE DOLLARS WORKING WITH

438
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,207
THE BLACK RIDER TO TARGET

439
00:12:09,207 --> 00:12:10,442
THE YELLOW SCARVES,

440
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:11,810
THEN IT ALL ADDS UP.

441
00:12:11,810 --> 00:12:12,811
>> HEY, YUMATCH.

442
00:12:12,811 --> 00:12:13,812
ISN’T THERE SOMETHING WRONG

443
00:12:13,812 --> 00:12:14,813
WITH THIS THEORY?

444
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,281
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

445
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:17,482
>> THE BLACK RIDER TOOK OUT

446
00:12:17,482 --> 00:12:18,150
THE SLASHER.

447
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,819
WE SAW IT WITH OUR OWN EYES.

448
00:12:19,819 --> 00:12:20,820
>> YEAH, SABURO EVEN SMASHED

449
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,821
INTO HIM.

450
00:12:21,821 --> 00:12:23,323
>> AND THEN SHIZU-CHAN PUMMELED

451
00:12:23,323 --> 00:12:24,357
HIM WITH THE DOOR.

452
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:25,558
>> THEN AGAIN, THAT WAS

453
00:12:25,558 --> 00:12:27,160
THE NIGHT 50 OTHER PEOPLE

454
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,562
GOT SLASHED.

455
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:29,830
MAYBE IT’S ONE OF THEM!

456
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,131
>> Kyohei: EITHER WAY, WE’VE

457
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,566
SEEN THE LAST OF THE SLASHER.

458
00:12:32,566 --> 00:12:33,567
>> OH?

459
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:34,635
>> I HEARD THOSE GUYS PICKED

460
00:12:34,635 --> 00:12:37,204
A FIGHT WITH SHIZUO HEIWAJIMA.

461
00:12:37,204 --> 00:12:39,073
AND YOU KNOW HOW THAT GOES.

462
00:12:39,073 --> 00:12:40,374
>> [sighs] YEAH, BUT--

463
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:41,376
>> I’M GIVING YOU

464
00:12:41,376 --> 00:12:42,377
THE PHONE NUMBER FOR THE GUY

465
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:43,378
WHO CAN TELL YOU

466
00:12:43,378 --> 00:12:44,379
WHO OUR BOSS IS.

467
00:12:44,379 --> 00:12:45,380
>> [gasps]

468
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,585
>> DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT.

469
00:12:49,585 --> 00:12:50,619

CUSTOMERS.

472
00:12:58,828 --> 00:13:00,196
I WANT YOU TO EAT THAT,

473
00:13:00,196 --> 00:13:01,197
AND THEN WALK OUTTA HERE

474
00:13:01,197 --> 00:13:02,198

>> [gasps] THIS IS GREAT.

476
00:13:03,667 --> 00:13:04,668
THANKS.

477
00:13:04,668 --> 00:13:06,503

OTHER PEOPLE’S HAPPINESS.

482
00:13:12,209 --> 00:13:14,345
SHARE THE HAPPINESS.

483
00:13:14,345 --> 00:13:16,147
LISTEN, THIS I LEARN.

484
00:13:16,147 --> 00:13:17,582
"THE MERCILESS ARE NOTHING MORE

485
00:13:17,582 --> 00:13:19,217
THAN FAILED CATFISH."

486
00:13:19,217 --> 00:13:20,218
YOU TELL ME WHAT IT MEANS?

487
00:13:20,218 --> 00:13:21,753
>> "MERCY BENEFITS ALL,"

488
00:13:21,753 --> 00:13:22,788
YOU MEAN.

489
00:13:22,788 --> 00:13:24,656
>> YOU A CATFISH, YOUNG KIDA?

490
00:13:24,656 --> 00:13:26,225
THAT IT? ARE YOU?

491
00:13:26,225 --> 00:13:29,261
>> THIS IS GOOD, THANK YOU.

492
00:13:29,261 --> 00:13:30,763
>> SO BORED.

493
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,264
WHO KNEW HAVING NOTHING TO DO

494
00:13:32,264 --> 00:13:35,167
WOULD BE SO INCREDIBLY TEDIOUS?

495
00:13:35,167 --> 00:13:36,569
>> CAN I HIT YOU?

496
00:13:36,569 --> 00:13:37,870
>> OH, RELAX.

497
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,640
I <i>AM</i> PAYING YOU, AFTER ALL.

498
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:41,842
>> WHAT IS THIS CHOCOLATE THING

499
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,911
THAT YOU SENT TO THE AWAKUSU?

500
00:13:43,911 --> 00:13:45,679
>> IT WAS A HANDGUN, WHY?

501
00:13:45,679 --> 00:13:47,681
>> HUH?

502
00:13:47,681 --> 00:13:48,682
>> I’M SURE YOU HEARD

503
00:13:48,682 --> 00:13:49,683
ABOUT THIS.

504
00:13:49,683 --> 00:13:51,686
SIX MONTHS AGO, SOMEONE RAN OFF

505
00:13:51,686 --> 00:13:52,687
WITH A BUNCH OF HANDGUNS

506
00:13:52,687 --> 00:13:54,322
FROM THE AWAKUSU GROUP.

507
00:13:54,322 --> 00:13:55,324
>> OH, RIGHT.

508
00:13:55,324 --> 00:13:56,825
THE GUY THAT NASTY DULLAHAN

509
00:13:56,825 --> 00:13:58,360
WAS CHASING.

510
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,428
>> THAT’S RIGHT.

511
00:13:59,428 --> 00:14:00,863
CELTY WAS ABLE TO TRACK DOWN

512
00:14:00,863 --> 00:14:02,264
MOST OF THEM BEFORE THEY COULD

513
00:14:02,264 --> 00:14:03,766
CAUSE ANY KIND OF PROBLEM.

514
00:14:03,766 --> 00:14:04,767
BUT THERE’S STILL ONE

515
00:14:04,767 --> 00:14:06,436
UNACCOUNTED FOR.

516
00:14:06,436 --> 00:14:07,937
THAT’S WHY--

517
00:14:07,937 --> 00:14:11,307
[cell phone ringing]

518
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:13,176
WELL, I THOUGHT YOU MIGHT BE

519
00:14:13,176 --> 00:14:14,878
CALLING ME SOON.

520
00:14:14,878 --> 00:14:15,779
>> THAT’S BULLSHIT.

521
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,548
>> YES, OF COURSE.

522
00:14:17,548 --> 00:14:18,615
>> OKAY.

523
00:14:18,615 --> 00:14:20,484
I’LL BE RIGHT THERE.

524
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,552
>> IN THE END, HE WAS THE ONLY

525
00:14:21,552 --> 00:14:23,254
ONE WHO COULDN’T RUN FROM HIS

526
00:14:23,254 --> 00:14:23,688
PAST.

527
00:14:29,494 --> 00:14:31,263
>> A GREAT MAN ONCE SAID,

528
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:32,831
"THE WORLD IS SYMBOLIC."

529
00:14:32,831 --> 00:14:34,466
AT LEAST, I THINK HE SAID IT.

530
00:14:34,466 --> 00:14:35,734
EVEN IF HE DIDN’T, I’M SURE

531
00:14:35,734 --> 00:14:36,835
SOMEONE ELSE SAID SOMETHING

532
00:14:36,835 --> 00:14:38,671
PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT.

533
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,273
>> IT’S BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE

534
00:14:40,273 --> 00:14:41,807
I’VE SEEN YOU MAKE THAT FACE.

535
00:14:41,807 --> 00:14:42,809
YOU WERE JUST

536
00:14:42,809 --> 00:14:44,277
A MIDDLE-SCHOOL KID,

537
00:14:44,277 --> 00:14:45,278
BUT YOUR EXPRESSION WAS

538
00:14:45,278 --> 00:14:46,680
ALL ADULT.

539
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:47,681
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH WITH

540
00:14:47,681 --> 00:14:48,782
THE REMINISCING.

541
00:14:48,782 --> 00:14:49,816
IT’S TIME THAT I GAVE YOU

542
00:14:49,816 --> 00:14:52,552
A PROPER GREETING.

543
00:14:52,552 --> 00:14:53,620
WELCOME BACK.

544
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:54,722
>> [clicks tongue angrily]

545
00:14:54,722 --> 00:14:55,723
>> I THINK I KNOW WHAT

546
00:14:55,723 --> 00:14:57,357
YOU WANNA ASK.

547
00:14:57,357 --> 00:14:58,459
I SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE ANSWERED

548
00:14:58,459 --> 00:14:59,894
YOUR QUESTION OVER THE PHONE,

549
00:14:59,894 --> 00:15:02,263
BUT THAT SEEMED INAPPROPRIATE

550
00:15:02,263 --> 00:15:04,800
DUE TO HOW SERIOUS THIS IS.

551
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,234
I HEARD A FRIEND OF YOURS

552
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:07,435
GOT SLASHED.

553
00:15:07,435 --> 00:15:08,470
I BELIEVE HER NAME IS

554
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:11,473
ANRI SONOHARA, ISN’T THAT RIGHT?

555
00:15:11,473 --> 00:15:13,375
AND FROM THE LOOKS OF IT, I’D

556
00:15:13,375 --> 00:15:14,610
SAY THAT SHE’S MORE IMPORTANT

557
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:15,611
TO YOU THAN THOSE KIDS

558
00:15:15,611 --> 00:15:16,979
IN THE YELLOW SCARVES ARE.

559
00:15:16,979 --> 00:15:17,980
>> ONCE UPON A TIME, A YOUNG

560
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:20,550
BOY, HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY MANGA

561
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:21,551
AND TV SHOWS, CREATED A GANG

562
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,753
CALLED THE YELLOW SCARVES.

563
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:24,821
>> THE YELLOW SCARVES FOUGHT

564
00:15:24,821 --> 00:15:25,889
ANOTHER GANG WHO USED BLUE AS

565
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:28,659
THEIR DISTINGUISHING COLOR.

566
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:29,660
AND SOON BOTH SIDES WERE

567
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:31,662
IN GRAVE PERIL.

568
00:15:31,662 --> 00:15:32,663
>> THEN, A BRILLIANT STRATEGIST

569
00:15:32,663 --> 00:15:33,664
CAME ON THE SCENE.

570
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,665
>> WHY ARE YOUR CHARACTERS

571
00:15:34,665 --> 00:15:35,900
ALWAYS CUTE GIRLS?

572
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:36,901
>> BUT HE WASN’T REALLY

573
00:15:36,901 --> 00:15:38,302
A BRILLIANT STRATEGIST--

574
00:15:38,302 --> 00:15:39,671
MORE LIKE A CUNNING DICTATOR.

575
00:15:39,671 --> 00:15:40,672
>> AND THEN THE OTHER GROUP,

576
00:15:40,672 --> 00:15:41,673
NOW IN DANGER ITSELF,

577
00:15:41,673 --> 00:15:42,674
KIDNAPPED THE YOUNG BOY’S

578
00:15:42,674 --> 00:15:43,675
PRINCESS.

579
00:15:43,675 --> 00:15:44,676
THE BOY TRIED TO SAVE HER,

580
00:15:44,676 --> 00:15:45,677
BUT BEFORE HE COULD

581
00:15:45,677 --> 00:15:47,579
SAVE THE DAY, HE WAS OVERWHELMED

582
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,615
BY FEAR AND--

583
00:15:49,615 --> 00:15:50,650
>> NOW, LET’S SUPPOSE THIS GIRL

584
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:51,651
YOU LIKE WAS CAUGHT IN A

585
00:15:51,651 --> 00:15:53,386
YELLOW SCARVES GANG WAR,

586
00:15:53,386 --> 00:15:55,621
AND, AS A RESULT, BADLY HURT.

587
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:57,523
YES, YES, THAT WOULD BE BAD.

588
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:58,524
IT WOULD BE LIKE THAT INCIDENT

589
00:15:58,524 --> 00:16:00,694
WITH SAKI ALL OVER AGAIN.

590
00:16:00,694 --> 00:16:01,762
LET ME GUESS WHAT

591
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:03,964
YOU’RE THINKING RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

592
00:16:03,964 --> 00:16:04,998
I BET IT’S SOMETHING LIKE,

593
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,334
"I THOUGHT I TRULY LOVED SAKI.

594
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:08,402
BUT IN THE END, I WAS MORE

595
00:16:08,402 --> 00:16:09,536
AFRAID FOR MY OWN LIFE

596
00:16:09,536 --> 00:16:10,538
THAN FOR HERS."

597
00:16:10,538 --> 00:16:12,039
SO MAYBE IT WASN’T TRUE LOVE

598
00:16:12,039 --> 00:16:13,040
AFTER ALL.

599
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,041
MAYBE YOU WERE JUST

600
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,643
AFTER HER BODY.

601
00:16:15,643 --> 00:16:17,312
WHICH, IN RETURN, MEANS,

602
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:18,546
MAYBE YOU DIDN’T LOVE HER NEARLY

603
00:16:18,546 --> 00:16:20,549
AS MUCH AS YOU THOUGHT YOU DID.

604
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:21,617
IS THAT IT?

605
00:16:21,617 --> 00:16:22,618
>> GOOD LORD.

606
00:16:22,618 --> 00:16:23,886
DOES HE EVER STOP?

607
00:16:23,886 --> 00:16:25,488
>> SO NOW YOU’VE BEGUN TO HOPE

608
00:16:25,488 --> 00:16:26,822
NOT TRULY LOVING HER IS INDEED

609
00:16:26,822 --> 00:16:28,657
WHAT CAUSED YOUR INACTION.

610
00:16:28,657 --> 00:16:30,694
BECAUSE IF YOU DID LOVE A GIRL,

611
00:16:30,694 --> 00:16:31,961
YOU’D HAVE NO PROBLEM RISKING

612
00:16:31,961 --> 00:16:33,730
YOUR LIFE TO SAVE HER.

613
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:35,699
AND IF THAT’S TRUE,

614
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,968
ANRI WILL BE YOUR LITMUS TEST.

615
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:39,003
>> IF THAT’S WHY YOU THINK

616
00:16:39,003 --> 00:16:40,838
I’M DOING THIS, FINE.

617
00:16:40,838 --> 00:16:41,906
>> [sighs]

618
00:16:41,906 --> 00:16:43,674
>> I JUST WANNA SETTLE THIS

619
00:16:43,674 --> 00:16:44,809
SCORE PERSONALLY.

620
00:16:44,809 --> 00:16:46,611
>> WHAT ARE YOU REFERRING TO?

621
00:16:46,611 --> 00:16:48,013
TAKING OUT THE SLASHER?

622
00:16:48,013 --> 00:16:49,747
OR DESTROYING THE DOLLARS?

623
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:50,749
>> DEPENDING ON WHAT

624
00:16:50,749 --> 00:16:52,751
YOU TELL ME, IT MIGHT BE BOTH.

625
00:16:52,751 --> 00:16:54,786
>> NOW, THAT’S THE SPIRIT!

626
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,522
ALL RIGHT, THEN.

627
00:16:56,522 --> 00:16:57,523
LET’S GIVE YOU SOMETHING

628
00:16:57,523 --> 00:16:58,590
TO MOVE ON.

629
00:16:58,590 --> 00:17:00,059
I’LL TELL YOU THE TRUTH.

630
00:17:00,059 --> 00:17:01,894
THE SIMPLE, COLD, HARD FACTS.

631
00:17:01,894 --> 00:17:03,496
THE REALITY, ALL LAID OUT,

632
00:17:03,496 --> 00:17:04,497
STRAIGHTFORWARD AND PLAIN AS

633
00:17:04,497 --> 00:17:06,032
DAY.

634
00:17:06,032 --> 00:17:07,033
THE THREE ARE USUALLY

635
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:08,501
QUITE DIFFERENT,

636
00:17:08,501 --> 00:17:09,536
BUT IN THIS CASE,

637
00:17:09,536 --> 00:17:10,938
THEY ALL FOLD INTO ONE.

638
00:17:10,938 --> 00:17:11,939
>> [gasps]

639
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:12,940
>> BY THE WAY,

640
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:14,041
HOW’S YOUR FRIEND MIKADO?

641
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:15,042
>> WHA--?

642
00:17:15,042 --> 00:17:16,143
>> [chuckles] REMEMBER?

643
00:17:16,143 --> 00:17:17,378
WE BUMPED INTO EACH OTHER,

644
00:17:17,378 --> 00:17:18,746
AND YOU INTRODUCED US.

645
00:17:18,746 --> 00:17:20,581
IT WAS EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

646
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:22,784
MIKADO RYUGAMINE, RIGHT?

647
00:17:22,784 --> 00:17:23,985
>> I REMEMBER, BUT WHY ARE YOU

648
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:25,854
MENTIONING HIM NOW?

649
00:17:25,854 --> 00:17:26,888
>> I FIGURED, WITH HIM BEING

650
00:17:26,888 --> 00:17:28,423
SUCH A GOOD FRIEND OF YOURS,

651
00:17:28,423 --> 00:17:29,424
HE’D BE CONCERNED ABOUT

652
00:17:29,424 --> 00:17:30,725
YOUR SITUATION.

653
00:17:30,725 --> 00:17:31,726
>> HE HAS NOTHING TO DO

654
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:33,062
WITH THIS!

655
00:17:33,062 --> 00:17:34,063
I HAVEN’T TOLD HIM

656
00:17:34,063 --> 00:17:35,097
ABOUT THE YELLOW SCARVES,

657
00:17:35,097 --> 00:17:36,098
AND I WON’T.

658
00:17:36,098 --> 00:17:37,099
HE’S STILL THE SAME.

659
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:39,569
A LITTLE NA VE BUT DOING OKAY.

660
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:40,770
LIVING EVERY DAY LIKE

661
00:17:40,770 --> 00:17:42,638
IT’S THE BEST DAY EVER.

662
00:17:42,638 --> 00:17:44,174
>> AH, DO I DETECT A LITTLE BIT

663
00:17:44,174 --> 00:17:45,642
OF JEALOUSY IN YOUR VOICE?

664
00:17:45,642 --> 00:17:46,743
THAT THE LIFE YOU WANT?

665
00:17:46,743 --> 00:17:47,744
>> I TOLD YOU THIS HAS NOTHING

666
00:17:47,744 --> 00:17:48,979
TO DO WITH HIM!

667
00:17:48,979 --> 00:17:50,614
>> AH, BUT WHAT IF IT DID?

668
00:17:50,614 --> 00:17:52,049
>> [gasps] HUH?

669
00:17:52,049 --> 00:17:53,751
>> ISN’T THAT PERFECT?

670
00:17:53,751 --> 00:17:55,720
MIKADO IS DOING SO WELL.

671
00:17:55,720 --> 00:17:56,721
YOU’RE HERE,

672
00:17:56,721 --> 00:17:57,722
COMPLETELY MISERABLE,

673
00:17:57,722 --> 00:17:58,723
AND HE’S ENJOYING EVERY SINGLE

674
00:17:58,723 --> 00:17:59,824
DAY.

675
00:17:59,824 --> 00:18:00,892
AND YET HE’S THE ONE WHO’S

676
00:18:00,892 --> 00:18:02,660
CAUSING YOU MISERY.

677
00:18:02,660 --> 00:18:03,762
>> WAIT A SEC!

678
00:18:03,762 --> 00:18:05,163
JUST WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY

679
00:18:05,163 --> 00:18:06,765
"HE’S THE CAUSE"?

680
00:18:06,765 --> 00:18:08,667
>> DO I NEED TO SPELL IT OUT?

681
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,735
THE HEAD OF THE DOLLARS IS

682
00:18:09,735 --> 00:18:11,570
YOUR OLDEST AND DEAREST FRIEND,

683
00:18:11,570 --> 00:18:13,672
MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

684
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:14,908
ALTHOUGH YOU MIGHT BE

685
00:18:14,908 --> 00:18:16,042
THE ONLY ONE WHO CONSIDERS

686
00:18:16,042 --> 00:18:16,876
YOURSELF FRIENDS IN THAT--

687
00:18:16,876 --> 00:18:18,712
>> REALITY IS SUCH A PAIN.

688
00:18:18,712 --> 00:18:20,447
AND FOR THOSE OF US WHO GET FED

689
00:18:20,447 --> 00:18:21,848
UP WITH THAT KIND OF REALITY,

690
00:18:21,848 --> 00:18:22,882
WE SIMPLY CHOOSE TO MAKE A NEW

691
00:18:22,882 --> 00:18:24,051
ONE.

692
00:18:24,051 --> 00:18:25,185
WE CREATE LITTLE WALLS

693
00:18:25,185 --> 00:18:26,486
AND SEPARATE THE TRASH

694
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:27,722
FROM THE STUFF WE LIKE.

695
00:18:27,722 --> 00:18:28,756
AND WHEN THAT’S ALL DONE,

696
00:18:28,756 --> 00:18:30,658
WE KEEP THE THINGS WE CARE ABOUT

697
00:18:30,658 --> 00:18:32,093
AND KICK THE REST TO THE CURB.

698
00:18:32,093 --> 00:18:33,761
YOU’D BE AMAZED HOW WELL IT

699
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:34,863
WORKS!

700
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:36,564
A WHOLE WORLD MADE OUT OF JUST

701
00:18:36,564 --> 00:18:37,966
MO-EH, TSOON-DEH-REH, AND BL!

702
00:18:37,966 --> 00:18:38,967
IT’S THE BEST DISCOVERY EVER!

703
00:18:38,967 --> 00:18:40,569
OH, COOL.

704
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:41,637
IF YOU ASK ME,

705
00:18:41,637 --> 00:18:42,771
THAT REALLY IS THE BEST WAY

706
00:18:42,771 --> 00:18:43,939
TO SEPARATE REALITY FROM

707
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:45,875
FICTION.

708
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,143

709
00:18:47,143 --> 00:18:48,811

714
00:18:53,583 --> 00:18:54,051
RIGHT?

715
00:18:54,051 --> 00:18:55,052
>> ACTUALLY, THIS TIME THE

716
00:18:55,052 --> 00:18:56,754
DOLLARS HIT THE YELLOW SCARVES

717
00:18:56,754 --> 00:18:58,221
AT THEIR OWN HQ.

719
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:00,858

THIS SECRET HIDEOUT THEY HAVE.

725

726
00:19:08,933 --> 00:19:10,569
>> HEY, SETTON, IS SOMETHING

727
00:19:10,569 --> 00:19:11,035
WRONG?

728
00:19:11,035 --> 00:19:12,771
>> THAT CAN’T BE TRUE.

729
00:19:12,771 --> 00:19:13,772
I DON’T BELIEVE THAT.

730
00:19:13,772 --> 00:19:15,207
EVEN FROM YOU, KANRA.

731
00:19:15,207 --> 00:19:17,076
THAT’S WAY TOO ABSURD.
