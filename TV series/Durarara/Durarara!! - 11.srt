OF ’EM IN TOKYO RIGHT NOW.

346
00:14:22,906 --> 00:14:23,874
>> ARE YOU SAYING YOU WANT TO

347
00:14:23,874 --> 00:14:25,408
MAKE AN ONLINE GANG?

348
00:14:25,408 --> 00:14:27,309
>> NO, THAT’S NOT WHAT I MEAN.

349
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:28,477
I WANT PEOPLE TO THINK THIS ONE

350
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:29,511
IS REAL.

351
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,246
WE’LL JUST SAY THE GANG IS IN

352
00:14:31,246 --> 00:14:32,980
IKEBUKURO, AND WE’LL SPREAD THE

353
00:14:32,980 --> 00:14:34,915
RUMOR ALL OVER THE INTERNET.

354
00:14:34,915 --> 00:14:37,016
NONE OF US EVER REVEALED THAT WE

355
00:14:37,016 --> 00:14:38,551
WERE PART OF THE DOLLARS.

356
00:14:38,551 --> 00:14:40,252
WE TOLD PEOPLE THAT WE’D HEARD

357
00:14:40,252 --> 00:14:41,954
THE RUMOR FROM SOMEWHERE ELSE,

358
00:14:41,954 --> 00:14:42,987
AND PRETTY SOON IT WAS

359
00:14:42,987 --> 00:14:45,122
EVERYWHERE.

360
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:46,923
WE MADE A WEB SITE FOR THE GANG,

361
00:14:46,923 --> 00:14:48,191
ONE YOU CAN ONLY ACCESS WITH A

362
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:49,892
PASSWORD.

363
00:14:49,892 --> 00:14:50,993
THEN WE RANDOMLY LEAKED THE

364
00:14:50,993 --> 00:14:54,529
PASSWORD IN EMAILS AND FORUMS.

365
00:14:54,529 --> 00:14:56,364
I EVEN CREATED A BUNCH OF POSTS

366
00:14:56,364 --> 00:14:57,498
ON OUR MESSAGE BOARD AS OTHER

367
00:14:57,498 --> 00:14:58,632
MEMBERS.

368
00:14:58,632 --> 00:15:00,433
OF COURSE, A LOT OF PEOPLE

369
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,001
DIDN’T BELIEVE US.

370
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,302
BUT AFTER A WHILE, PEOPLE

371
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,036
STARTED TO STICK UP FOR US.

372
00:15:05,036 --> 00:15:07,338
EVERYONE WAS HAPPY.

373
00:15:07,338 --> 00:15:08,373
>> DUDE, EVERYONE’S BUYING IT.

374
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:09,506
>> I KNOW. THEY’RE ALL IDIOTS.

375
00:15:09,506 --> 00:15:12,308
>> BUT I HAD A BAD FEELING.

376
00:15:20,081 --> 00:15:21,115
PEOPLE STARTED APPEARING IN THE

377
00:15:21,115 --> 00:15:22,416
REAL WORLD SAYING THEY WERE IN

378
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,050
THE DOLLARS.

379
00:15:24,050 --> 00:15:27,419
THAT’S NOT ALL.

380
00:15:27,419 --> 00:15:28,687
OUR MEMBER COUNT WAS REALLY

381
00:15:28,687 --> 00:15:31,055
SKYROCKETING...

382
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,256
EVEN THOUGH WE’D LONG STOPPED

383
00:15:32,256 --> 00:15:34,457
GIVING OUT THE PASSWORD.

384
00:15:34,457 --> 00:15:37,093
IT WAS LIKE SOMEONE ELSE WAS

385
00:15:37,093 --> 00:15:39,428
LEAKING IT FOR US.

386
00:15:39,428 --> 00:15:42,297
HEY, GUYS, ARE YOU THERE?

387
00:15:42,297 --> 00:15:43,931
HELLO?

388
00:15:43,931 --> 00:15:45,065
MAYBE THEY GOT SCARED, BUT THE

389
00:15:45,065 --> 00:15:46,700
GUYS WHO HELPED ME START THE

390
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:49,235
DOLLARS HAD VANISHED.

391
00:15:52,937 --> 00:15:54,338
EVEN THOUGH THEY LEFT, I KEPT

392
00:15:54,338 --> 00:15:55,506
WITH IT.

393
00:15:55,506 --> 00:15:57,608
TRUTH IS, I COULDN’T STOP.

394
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,075
MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE WALKED AWAY

395
00:15:59,075 --> 00:16:03,112
THEN, BUT I DIDN’T.

396
00:16:03,112 --> 00:16:05,013
NO, THAT ISN’T TRUE.

397
00:16:05,013 --> 00:16:06,014
I KNOW THERE’S BEEN SOME BAD

398
00:16:06,014 --> 00:16:07,515
PEOPLE, BUT MOST OF THE PEOPLE

399
00:16:07,515 --> 00:16:09,216
IN THE GROUP ARE GOOD.

400
00:16:09,216 --> 00:16:10,250
I KNOW IT.

401
00:16:10,250 --> 00:16:12,018
WHY DON’T WE MAKE THE DOLLARS

402
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,619
DIFFERENT FROM THE OTHER GANGS?

403
00:16:13,619 --> 00:16:15,086
LET’S MAKE IT A GOOD ONE.

404
00:16:15,086 --> 00:16:16,154
LET’S ALWAYS DO WHAT’S RIGHT SO

405
00:16:16,154 --> 00:16:17,655
WE NEGATE ALL THE BAD

406
00:16:17,655 --> 00:16:18,989
IMPRESSIONS ALL THE OTHER GANGS

407
00:16:18,989 --> 00:16:20,057
HAVE LEFT BEHIND.

408
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:24,160
UH...EHH...

409
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:25,561
LIKE PICKING UP GARBAGE OR

410
00:16:25,561 --> 00:16:27,062
ERASING GRAFFITI.

411
00:16:27,062 --> 00:16:32,033

415
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:39,104
MYSTIFIED.

SOMETIME DURING THE COURSE OF

417
00:16:40,405 --> 00:16:42,340
LAST NIGHT, THE LARGE AMOUNT OF

418
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,607
GRAFFITI THAT HAD STAINED THIS

419

NEIGHBORHOOD’S WALL SUDDENLY

420
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:47,377
DISAPPEARED BY THIS MORNING.

421
00:16:47,377 --> 00:16:48,644
IT’S HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ONE

422
00:16:48,644 --> 00:16:50,246
PERSON COULD HAVE REMOVED SO

423
00:16:50,246 --> 00:16:51,379
MUCH GRAFFITI.

424
00:16:51,379 --> 00:16:52,580
AT THIS JUNCTURE, NO ONE...

>> [nervous chuckle]

NO, THIS CAN’T BE.

427
00:16:55,049 --> 00:16:57,417
MASAOMI INVITED ME TO TOKYO, AND

428
00:16:57,417 --> 00:16:58,451
I CAME.

429
00:16:58,451 --> 00:16:59,152
AND THEN...

430
00:16:59,152 --> 00:17:00,086
THE DOLLARS?

435
00:17:04,256 --> 00:17:05,256
CRAZY.

436
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:07,091
I WOULD JUST STAY AWAY FROM THEM

IF I WAS YOU.

438
00:17:08,058 --> 00:17:09,225
THEY’RE SORT OF LIKE A COLOR

440
