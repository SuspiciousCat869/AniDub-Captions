00:06:42,779 --> 00:06:44,281
FELL IN LOVE.

174
00:06:44,281 --> 00:06:46,016
CUTE LITTLE SMILE, BITCHIN’

175
00:06:46,016 --> 00:06:47,951
BOOBS--I GUESS SHE WASN’T

176
00:06:47,951 --> 00:06:49,052
SMILING, WHATEVER.

177
00:06:49,052 --> 00:06:50,854
>> I SAID I DON’T KNOW ANYTHING!

178
00:06:50,854 --> 00:06:51,855
>> WAIT, HOLD ON!

179
00:06:51,855 --> 00:06:53,023
>> HELLO!

180
00:06:53,023 --> 00:06:58,962
HEY, YOU GOOD DOWN THERE?

181
00:06:58,962 --> 00:07:00,330
WELL, THAT’S THE SHORT OF HOW

182
00:07:00,330 --> 00:07:01,664
SHE FOUND HERSELF AT THE VERY

183
00:07:01,664 --> 00:07:02,898
TOP OF MY POTENTIAL GIRLFRIEND

184
00:07:02,898 --> 00:07:04,400
LIST.

185
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:10,005
AND THEN...

186
00:07:10,005 --> 00:07:13,342
>> HEY, ANRI.

187
00:07:13,342 --> 00:07:15,077
YOU HEADING HOME NOW?

188
00:07:15,077 --> 00:07:18,013
>> YEAH.

189
00:07:18,013 --> 00:07:19,381
>> EVERYTHING OKAY, ANRI?

190
00:07:19,381 --> 00:07:20,816
IF SOMETHING IS BOTHERING YOU,

191
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,384
YOU CAN TELL ME.

192
00:07:22,384 --> 00:07:23,885
I’M CONCERNED.

193
00:07:23,885 --> 00:07:24,987
IF THERE’S A BULLY OR YOU’RE IN

194
00:07:24,987 --> 00:07:27,021
TROUBLE, LET ME KNOW.

195
00:07:27,021 --> 00:07:28,022
>> I’M FINE.

196
00:07:28,022 --> 00:07:29,023
>> YOU’RE SURE THERE ISN’T

197
00:07:29,023 --> 00:07:31,960
SOMETHING YOU WANNA TALK ABOUT?

198
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:33,862
>> NO, I’M FINE.

199
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:35,730
>> OKAY, YOU KNOW, I HAVEN’T

200
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,999
SEEN HARIMA COME TO SCHOOL YET.

201
00:07:37,999 --> 00:07:39,033
EVEN THOUGH YOU’RE BOTH IN THE

202
00:07:39,033 --> 00:07:40,869
SAME CLASS NOW.

203
00:07:40,869 --> 00:07:42,170
I WANT YOU TO KNOW IT WASN’T

204
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:43,938
EASY MAKING THAT HAPPEN.

205
00:07:43,938 --> 00:07:45,940
I TALKED TO MR. SAITOU FROM YOUR

206
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:46,874
JUNIOR HIGH.

207
00:07:46,874 --> 00:07:48,042
HE TOLD ME TO MAKE SURE THAT

208
00:07:48,042 --> 00:07:49,810
I TAKE EXTRA SPECIAL CARE

209
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:51,212
OF YOU, SO YOU CAN TELL ME

210
00:07:51,212 --> 00:07:53,247
ANYTHING YOU WANT, OKAY?

211
00:07:53,247 --> 00:07:55,082
I KNOW--WHY DON’T I TAKE YOU

212
00:07:55,082 --> 00:07:56,917
HOME TODAY?

213
00:07:56,917 --> 00:07:57,951
DID YOU HEAR?

214
00:07:57,951 --> 00:07:59,720
THE SLASHER WAS IN IKEBUKURO

215
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,888
AGAIN.

216
00:08:00,888 --> 00:08:01,955
>> MM.

217
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:03,290
>> MR. NASUJIMA, ARE YOU

218
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:04,992
SEXUALLY HARASSING HER?

219
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:05,793
>> UH...

220
00:08:05,793 --> 00:08:07,060
>> UNH!

221
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:08,428
>> WOW, YOU SURE WERE GETTING

222
00:08:08,428 --> 00:08:09,862
PRETTY HANDSY THERE WITH OUR

223
00:08:09,862 --> 00:08:11,064
CLASS REP, TEACH.

224
00:08:11,064 --> 00:08:12,332
I MEAN, IF THAT WASN’T SEXUAL

225
00:08:12,332 --> 00:08:13,900
HARASSMENT, THEN I SURE DON’T

226
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,067
KNOW WHAT IS.

227
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,403
SO YOU LIKE THE SEXY HOROSHO

228
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:17,937
TYPES.

229
00:08:17,937 --> 00:08:18,871
>> KIDA, ENOUGH WITH THE

230
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:20,139
CLOWNING.

231
00:08:20,139 --> 00:08:21,774
ANRI, I WOULDN’T WANT YOU TO GET

232
00:08:21,774 --> 00:08:22,809
THE WRONG IDEA AND START

233
00:08:22,809 --> 00:08:23,976
SPREADING RUMORS.

234
00:08:23,976 --> 00:08:25,144
>> DOES SHE REALLY SEEM LIKE THE

235
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,879
GOSSIPY TYPE TO YOU?

236
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,147
>> NO, YOU’VE GOT A POINT.

237
00:08:28,147 --> 00:08:29,115
YOU KIDS TAKE CARE.

238
00:08:29,115 --> 00:08:30,516
[chuckles]

239
00:08:30,516 --> 00:08:31,450
>> AND YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY

240
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,118
ABOUT.

241
00:08:32,118 --> 00:08:33,419
THE ONLY ONE SPREADING RUMORS

242
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:34,086
WILL BE ME.

243
00:08:34,086 --> 00:08:37,456
>> OH! AAH!

244
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:38,924
>> [chuckles] TOTALLY HEROIC,

245
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:40,025
RIGHT?

246
00:08:40,025 --> 00:08:41,126
CAN YOU GET MORE AWESOME THAN

247
00:08:41,126 --> 00:08:42,193
ME?

248
00:08:42,193 --> 00:08:43,395
HOW CAN SHE NOT BE IN LOVE RIGHT

249
00:08:43,395 --> 00:08:44,129
NOW?

250
00:08:44,129 --> 00:08:46,464
>> MASAOMI, ANRI.

251
00:08:46,464 --> 00:08:47,966
>> OF COURSE THIS IS WHEN YOU

252
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,267
WOULD SHOW UP.

253
00:08:54,105 --> 00:08:56,974
HERE YOU GO, ALL YOURS.

254
00:08:56,974 --> 00:09:00,511
>> THANK YOU.

255
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:02,213
>> HEY, SERIOUSLY, WATCH OUT FOR

256
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:03,981
THAT GUY.

257
00:09:03,981 --> 00:09:05,350
HE’S BAD NEWS.

258
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,951
MOST OF IT IS JUST RUMORS, BUT

259
00:09:06,951 --> 00:09:09,053
NASUJIMA REALLY DID GO AFTER A

260
00:09:09,053 --> 00:09:10,087
STUDENT ONCE.

261
00:09:10,087 --> 00:09:10,855
>> HE DID WHAT?

262
00:09:10,855 --> 00:09:11,822
>> YEAH, AN OLDER STUDENT NAMED

263
00:09:11,822 --> 00:09:13,257
HARUNA NIEKAWA.

264
00:09:13,257 --> 00:09:14,291
SHE TRANSFERRED OUT SECOND

265
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:16,060
SEMESTER OF LAST YEAR.

266
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:16,961
WORD ABOUT THEM DATING SPREAD

267
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:18,462
QUICKLY, THEN THEY BROKE THINGS

268
00:09:18,462 --> 00:09:20,197
OFF SO HE WOULDN’T GET BUSTED.

269
00:09:20,197 --> 00:09:21,298
>> REALLY?

270
00:09:21,298 --> 00:09:22,799
>> MAYBE NASUJIMA OR THE SCHOOL

271
00:09:22,799 --> 00:09:23,967
MADE HER LEAVE, OR SHE LEFT ON

272
00:09:23,967 --> 00:09:25,034
HER OWN.

273
00:09:25,034 --> 00:09:26,102
EITHER WAY, SHE’S NOT HERE THIS

274
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:27,270
YEAR.

275
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:29,138
HEY, IF HE MESSES WITH YOU,

276
00:09:29,138 --> 00:09:30,339
MIKADO AND I WILL TAKE HIM OUT.

277
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,407
WON’T WE, BUDDY?

278
00:09:31,407 --> 00:09:33,142
>> UH, YEAH.

279
00:09:33,142 --> 00:09:34,310
I’M NOT REALLY SURE WHAT I’M

280
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:36,279
SUPPOSED TO DO, BUT IF YOU NEED

281
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:37,981
MY HELP, I’M GLAD TO DO IT.

282
00:09:37,981 --> 00:09:39,182
>> DUDE, WRONG LINE.

283
00:09:39,182 --> 00:09:40,083
YOU’RE SUPPOSED TO BE ALL,

284
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:41,250
"I DON’T KNOW WHAT I’M DOING,

285
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:42,551
BUT LOVE IS THE WIND BENEATH MY

286
00:09:42,551 --> 00:09:43,352
WINGS."

287
00:09:43,352 --> 00:09:44,053
[eats ice cream]

288
00:09:44,053 --> 00:09:45,388
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT,

289
00:09:45,388 --> 00:09:46,255
OTHERWISE YOU’RE A PUSS.

290
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:47,990
>> HEY, HAVE SOME MANNERS.

291
00:09:47,990 --> 00:09:49,292
>> IT’S JUST THE TRUTH.

292
00:09:49,292 --> 00:09:50,993
>> ANYWAY, ABOUT THOSE GIRLS.

293
00:09:50,993 --> 00:09:51,460
>> HMM?

294
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,360
>> THE ONES THAT WERE BULLYING

295
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,028
YOU.

296
00:09:53,028 --> 00:09:54,029
THEY’RE FROM YOUR JUNIOR HIGH,

297
00:09:54,029 --> 00:09:54,530
RIGHT?

298
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,031
>> HOW--HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

299
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:57,332
>> WELL, IT WAS JUST SOME OF THE

300
00:09:57,332 --> 00:09:59,067
THINGS THEY SAID TO YOU.

301
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,135
IT SEEMED LIKE THERE MIGHT HAVE

302
00:10:00,135 --> 00:10:01,269
BEEN SOME OTHER GIRL AROUND WHO

303
00:10:01,269 --> 00:10:02,604
USED TO STICK UP FOR YOU.

304
00:10:02,604 --> 00:10:04,006
BUT I GUESS THAT GIRL’S GONE NOW

305
00:10:04,006 --> 00:10:05,573
AND SO THOSE GIRLS CAME BACK TO

306
00:10:05,573 --> 00:10:06,908
HARASS YOU AGAIN.

307
00:10:06,908 --> 00:10:07,909
>> YEAH, THAT’S RIGHT.

308
00:10:07,909 --> 00:10:08,843
A FRIEND OF YOURS WHO’S

309
00:10:08,843 --> 00:10:10,312
DISAPPEARED--STILL NO SIGN OF

310
00:10:10,312 --> 00:10:11,413
HER YET?

311
00:10:11,413 --> 00:10:12,514
>> IT’S MIKA HARIMA FROM OUR

312
00:10:12,514 --> 00:10:16,884
CLASS, RIGHT?

313
00:10:16,884 --> 00:10:17,919
>> THEY’RE SAYING THAT SHE’S

314
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,286
JUST ABSENT FROM SCHOOL RIGHT

315
00:10:19,286 --> 00:10:21,055
NOW, BUT SHE’S BEEN MISSING

316
00:10:21,055 --> 00:10:22,156
SINCE BEFORE SCHOOL EVEN

317
00:10:22,156 --> 00:10:24,391
STARTED.

318
00:10:24,391 --> 00:10:25,359
>> SHOULDN’T WE TELL THE COPS

319
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,928
ABOUT THIS?

320
00:10:26,928 --> 00:10:28,129
THE LAST I HEARD FROM HER, SHE

321
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,430
HAD SENT A TEXT TO ME AND HER

322
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:30,464
FAMILY.

323
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,965
SHE SAID HER HEART WAS BROKEN

324
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,133
AND SO SHE WAS TAKING A QUICK

325
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,168
TRIP AND NOT TO WORRY.

326
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:36,202
>> HER HEART WAS BROKEN?

327
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:37,504
WHAT HAPPENED?

328
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:40,541
>> WELL, SHE--LISTEN, THIS MIGHT

329
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:42,242
COME AS A BIT OF A SHOCK TO

330
00:10:42,242 --> 00:10:42,909
YOU--

331
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:43,877
>> AFTER ALL I’VE SEEN THESE

332
00:10:43,877 --> 00:10:45,178
PAST FEW DAYS, I DOUBT ANYTHING

333
00:10:45,178 --> 00:10:47,047
CAN SHOCK ME.

334
00:10:47,047 --> 00:10:49,282
>> MY FRIEND MIKA...

335
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:50,616
IS A STALKER.

336
00:10:50,616 --> 00:10:51,517
>> [coughs]

337
00:10:51,517 --> 00:10:52,885
BLAGH!

338
00:10:52,885 --> 00:10:54,487
>> GOTCHA, SO THAT GUY WE

339
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:55,621
OVERHEARD YOU TALKING TO

340
00:10:55,621 --> 00:10:58,624
EARLIER--MIKA WAS STALKING HIM.

341
00:10:58,624 --> 00:11:00,560
NO, SORRY, SHE WAS DEEPLY IN

342
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,094
LOVE WITH HIM AND HAD TO GO ON A

343
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,295
TRIP BECAUSE HE REJECTED HER.

344
00:11:03,295 --> 00:11:04,429
>> MM-HMM.

345
00:11:04,429 --> 00:11:05,330
>> THAT’S AN ISSUE FOR HER

346
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,132
FAMILY, THEN, NOT YOU.

347
00:11:07,132 --> 00:11:08,400
IF SHE DOESN’T COME BACK SOON,

348
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,035
THEY’LL CALL THE COPS.

349
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:11,470
>> MM.

350
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,038
>> WERE THE TWO OF YOU CLOSE?

351
00:11:13,038 --> 00:11:14,139
WERE YOU GOOD FRIENDS?

352
00:11:14,139 --> 00:11:17,142
>> WHY IS HE ASKING HER THAT?

353
00:11:17,142 --> 00:11:18,677
>> WELL, WE WERE TOGETHER ALL

354
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,078
THE TIME.

355
00:11:20,078 --> 00:11:22,080
>> WHOA, HIS INTUITION IS ODDLY

356
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,114
GOOD.

357
00:11:23,114 --> 00:11:24,148
>> I’M NOT NATURALLY VERY

358
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:26,217
SOCIAL, BUT SHE DRAGGED ME ALONG

359
00:11:26,217 --> 00:11:28,052
WHEREVER SHE WENT.

360
00:11:28,052 --> 00:11:29,187
AND IT WAS ONLY BECAUSE OF HER

361
00:11:29,187 --> 00:11:31,122
I ACTUALLY MET PEOPLE.

362
00:11:31,122 --> 00:11:32,924
THEN WHEN I FOUND OUT SHE CHOSE

363
00:11:32,924 --> 00:11:35,193
THE SAME HIGH SCHOOL I DID,

364
00:11:35,193 --> 00:11:36,127
I ACTUALLY FELT KINDA GUILTY

365
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:37,195
ABOUT IT.

366
00:11:37,195 --> 00:11:38,429
>> SO THEN--

367
00:11:38,429 --> 00:11:39,697
>> MIKADO, I KNOW WHAT YOU’RE

368
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:41,465
THINKING--THAT MIKA ONLY KEPT

369
00:11:41,465 --> 00:11:43,166
ANRI AROUND TO MAKE HERSELF LOOK

370
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,067
BETTER.

371
00:11:44,067 --> 00:11:45,636
BUT DUDE, DON’T SAY THAT.

372
00:11:45,636 --> 00:11:46,670
>> I KNOW.

373
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:47,337
>> both: HUH?

374
00:11:47,337 --> 00:11:48,438
>> KNOW WHAT?

375
00:11:48,438 --> 00:11:50,073
>> THAT MIKA WAS ONLY USING ME

376
00:11:50,073 --> 00:11:51,474
TO MAKE HERSELF LOOK BETTER.

377
00:11:51,474 --> 00:11:53,210
BUT TO BE COMPLETELY HONEST,

378
00:11:53,210 --> 00:11:54,677
I WAS USING HER TOO.

379
00:11:54,677 --> 00:11:56,413
DEPENDING ON HER MADE MY LIFE

380
00:11:56,413 --> 00:11:57,614
EASIER.

381
00:11:57,614 --> 00:11:58,715
PRETTY SOON I COULDN’T IMAGINE

382
00:11:58,715 --> 00:12:00,283
LIVING ANY OTHER WAY.

383
00:12:00,283 --> 00:12:01,118
>> UM...

384
00:12:01,118 --> 00:12:03,153
>> BUT NOW I THINK I’M OKAY.

385
00:12:03,153 --> 00:12:04,387
I’VE REALIZED THAT I DON’T

386
00:12:04,387 --> 00:12:06,122
REALLY NEED HER.

387
00:12:06,122 --> 00:12:07,557
I’M USED TO IT NOW.

388
00:12:07,557 --> 00:12:10,192
I’M DOING FINE WITHOUT HER.

389
00:12:10,192 --> 00:12:12,094
TO TELL YOU GUYS THE TRUTH,

390
00:12:12,094 --> 00:12:13,329
I ONLY ASKED TO BE CLASS REP

391
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:14,697
BECAUSE THAT’S THE JOB SHE

392
00:12:14,697 --> 00:12:15,732
WANTED.

393
00:12:15,732 --> 00:12:17,399
I FIGURED I SHOULD JUST DO IT IN

394
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:20,036
HER PLACE.

395
00:12:20,036 --> 00:12:21,403
I WANTED TO PROVE TO MYSELF THAT

396
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:24,005
I CAN BE BETTER THAN SHE IS.

397
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:25,341
YOU THINK I’M DEVIOUS, DON’T

398
00:12:25,341 --> 00:12:27,343
YOU?

399
00:12:27,343 --> 00:12:28,744
>> ACTUALLY I THINK IT’S DEVIOUS

400
00:12:28,744 --> 00:12:30,579
THAT YOU’RE TELLING US THIS.

401
00:12:30,579 --> 00:12:31,980
>> OH.

402
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,214
>> IT KINDA SEEMS LIKE YOU’RE

ASKING FOR OUR FORGIVENESS OR

404
00:12:34,415 --> 00:12:35,984
SOMETHING.

405
00:12:35,984 --> 00:12:36,752
THE FACT THAT YOU WANNA BE

406
00:12:36,752 --> 00:12:38,286
BETTER THAN HER IS NOT SOMETHING

407
00:12:38,286 --> 00:12:39,187
YOU SHOULD FEEL THE NEED TO

408
00:12:39,187 --> 00:12:40,155
DEFEND.

409
00:12:40,155 --> 00:12:41,222
IF YOU ASK ME, THAT’S SOMETHING

410
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:42,290
YOU SHOULD REALLY OWN AND BE

411
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:44,292
PROUD OF.
