IT.

7
00:01:45,425 --> 00:01:48,660
BUT IN A WEIRD WAY...I DUNNO...

8
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,128
I GUESS I SORT OF DO.

9
00:01:52,128 --> 00:01:54,330
ANYWAY, ONE THING’S FOR SURE.

10
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:55,096
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT

11
00:01:55,096 --> 00:01:58,132
CHANGED MY LIFE.

12
00:01:58,132 --> 00:02:00,733
BUT THEN AGAIN, NOTHING REALLY

13
00:02:00,733 --> 00:02:03,334
CHANGED AT ALL.

14
00:02:03,334 --> 00:02:05,802
YEAH, IT WAS REALLY WEIRD,

15
00:02:05,802 --> 00:02:07,237
THE KIND OF WEIRD THAT COULD

16
00:02:07,237 --> 00:02:08,870
HAPPEN TO ANYONE WHEN YOU THINK

17
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:10,738
ABOUT IT.

18
00:02:10,738 --> 00:02:12,372
AND IT HAPPENED HERE

19
00:02:12,372 --> 00:02:17,808
IN IKEBUKURO.

20
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:22,211
OHH. HMM.

21
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:23,778
AH! I’M SO SORRY!

22
00:02:23,778 --> 00:02:25,421
I DIDN’T MEAN...TO...

23

I WANNA GO HOME.

24
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,351
DON’T LAUGH, BUT I NEVER DID

25
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,818
THE FIELD TRIP THING DURING

26
00:02:35,818 --> 00:02:36,785
ELEMENTARY AND MIDDLE SCHOOL.

27
00:02:36,785 --> 00:02:37,853

>> I’VE NEVER LEFT MY HOMETOWN.

I’M 15, AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

30
00:02:41,421 --> 00:02:43,322
THIS IS MY FIRST TRIP TO TOKYO.

31
00:02:43,322 --> 00:02:46,391
THAT’S ME, MIKADO RYUGAMINE.

33

SO WHY AM I STANDING HERE

34
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:50,926
IN FRONT OF THE TOBU-TOJO LINE,

35
00:02:50,926 --> 00:02:51,994
LOOKING ALL CONFUSED AND

36
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:53,061
EVERYTHING?

37
00:02:53,061 --> 00:02:53,928
SIMPLE.

38
00:02:53,928 --> 00:02:55,429
IN APRIL, I START MY FIRST

39
00:02:55,429 --> 00:02:57,029
SEMESTER AT RAIRA ACADEMY

40
00:02:57,029 --> 00:02:58,997
IN EAST IKEBUKURO.

41
00:02:58,997 --> 00:03:00,398
IT’S A GOOD SCHOOL WITH GREAT

42
00:03:00,398 --> 00:03:01,832
FACILITIES.

43
00:03:01,832 --> 00:03:03,800
THE CAMPUS IS PRETTY SWEET, TOO.

44
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:05,468
BUT THE REAL REASON I’M HERE IS

45
00:03:05,468 --> 00:03:06,268
BECAUSE A FRIEND FROM

46
00:03:06,268 --> 00:03:07,869
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WANTED ME TO

47
00:03:07,869 --> 00:03:08,836
COME.

48
00:03:08,836 --> 00:03:09,836
MY PARENTS WANTED ME TO STAY

49
00:03:09,836 --> 00:03:11,237
HOME AND GO TO SCHOOL THERE.

50
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,205
BUT I’VE ALWAYS WANTED TO SEE

51
00:03:12,205 --> 00:03:13,105
TOKYO.

52
00:03:13,105 --> 00:03:14,373
>> MIKADO!

53
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,140
>> OH!

54
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,175
HOW’D YOU...MASAOMI?

55
00:03:19,175 --> 00:03:20,876
>> WAS THAT A QUESTION?

56
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,143
SOUNDED LIKE ONE.

57
00:03:22,143 --> 00:03:23,411
SO NOW YOU GET THREE ANSWERS

58
00:03:23,411 --> 00:03:24,711
TO CHOOSE FROM.

59
00:03:24,711 --> 00:03:27,013
ONE...MASAOMI KIDA!

60
00:03:27,013 --> 00:03:28,947
TWO...MASAOMI KIDA!

THREE...MASAOMI KIDA!

00:03:31,115 --> 00:03:33,283
>> WOW, MASAOMI, NO WAY!

63
00:03:33,283 --> 00:03:34,450
IT’S REALLY YOU?

00:03:37,018 --> 00:03:39,019
AND HE TOTALLY IGNORES IT.

67
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,953

IT LOOKS COOL.

71
00:03:43,855 --> 00:03:44,789
YOU LOOK SO DIFFERENT,

72
00:03:44,789 --> 00:03:46,423
I DIDN’T RECOGNIZE YOU.

73
00:03:46,423 --> 00:03:48,224
ALTHOUGH YOUR JOKES STILL SUCK.

74
00:03:48,224 --> 00:03:49,292
>> WHAT DO YOU EXPECT?

75
00:03:49,292 --> 00:03:50,825
IT’S BEEN FOUR YEARS.

76
00:03:50,825 --> 00:03:51,893
LOOK AT YOU.

77
00:03:51,893 --> 00:03:52,859
YOU HAVEN’T CHANGED.

78
00:03:52,859 --> 00:03:53,894
YOU LOOK THE SAME AS YOU DID

79
00:03:53,894 --> 00:03:55,095
IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

80
00:03:55,095 --> 00:03:56,862
AND, BUDDY, MY JOKES DON’T SUCK.

81
00:03:56,862 --> 00:03:58,096
THEY RULE.

82

MASAOMI KIDA, MY BEST FRIEND.

84
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:02,932
I HAVEN’T SEEN HIM SINCE HE

85
00:04:02,932 --> 00:04:03,899
TRANSFERRED OUT OF OUR

86
00:04:03,899 --> 00:04:05,233
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.

87
00:04:05,233 --> 00:04:06,834
AND BESIDES THE HAIR, HE HASN’T

88
00:04:06,834 --> 00:04:07,801
CHANGED AT ALL.

89

WE’D BEEN CHATTING ONLINE EVERY

99

100
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:24,744
THE DISTANCE BETWEEN US

101
00:04:24,744 --> 00:04:25,411

104
00:04:28,913 --> 00:04:30,280
YEARS LATER, YOU COULD TELL ME

105
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:31,947
AND HIM GREW UP IN TOTALLY

106
00:04:31,947 --> 00:04:32,948
DIFFERENT PLACES.

107
00:04:32,948 --> 00:04:33,949

LAME, I WOULDN’T HAVE TO

109
00:04:35,016 --> 00:04:36,250
EXPLAIN ’EM ALL THE TIME...

172
00:06:13,235 --> 00:06:14,403
GANGS ANYMORE.

173
00:06:14,403 --> 00:06:15,803
BUNCH OF FLASHY ONES WERE

174
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:17,037
HANGING AROUND LAST YEAR,

175
00:06:17,037 --> 00:06:18,205
BUT THEY CLASHED WITH THE GANGS

176
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:19,572
IN SAITAMA, AND MOST OF ’EM GOT

177
00:06:19,572 --> 00:06:20,806
BUSTED.

178
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:21,974
EVER SINCE THEN, YOU DON’T SEE

179
00:06:21,974 --> 00:06:23,408
PEOPLE STANDING AROUND WEARING

180
00:06:23,408 --> 00:06:25,476
THE SAME COLOR CLOTHES ANYMORE.

181
00:06:25,476 --> 00:06:27,042
I GUESS EVERYONE KNOWS THAT IF

182
00:06:27,042 --> 00:06:27,977
THEY DO THAT, THE COPS WOULD BE

183
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,511
AFTER THEM IN A SEC.

184
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:30,879
>> DOES THAT MEAN IKEBUKURO’S

185
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:32,112
A SAFE CITY NOW?

186
00:06:32,112 --> 00:06:33,180
>> UH, YEAH, RIGHT!

187
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,313
I MEAN, I’M NO EXPERT OR

188
00:06:34,313 --> 00:06:35,981
ANYTHING, BUT I WOULDN’T REALLY

189
00:06:35,981 --> 00:06:37,882
CONSIDER THIS PLACE SAFE.

190
00:06:37,882 --> 00:06:39,049
THERE’S WORSE THINGS HERE

191
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:40,584
THAN GANGS, YOU KNOW?

192
00:06:40,584 --> 00:06:41,517
BE CAREFUL.

193

197
00:06:49,021 --> 00:06:50,055

198
00:06:50,055 --> 00:06:51,923

199
00:06:51,923 --> 00:06:53,224
UH! SORRY!

200
00:06:53,224 --> 00:06:59,060

00:07:44,918 --> 00:07:46,052
HAVE A PEN NAME?

232
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,220
WAIT!
