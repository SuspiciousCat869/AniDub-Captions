00:13:31,449 --> 00:13:32,450
IT."

343
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:33,451
AND THAT’S WHEN MY MOM WOULD

344
00:13:33,451 --> 00:13:35,420
SHOW UP AND HELP LOOK FOR IT.

345
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:36,387
>> YOUR MOM SOUNDS LIKE SHE’S

346
00:13:36,387 --> 00:13:37,688
PRETTY NICE.

347
00:13:37,688 --> 00:13:40,225
>> YEAH, BOTH MY MOM AND DAD ARE

348
00:13:40,225 --> 00:13:42,693
REALLY NICE.

349
00:13:42,693 --> 00:13:45,095
OH.

350
00:13:45,095 --> 00:13:46,463
>> OH.

351
00:13:46,463 --> 00:13:48,666
>> WE CAN STOP, IT’S FINE.

352
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,801
I’LL JUST WEAR THESE HOME.

353
00:13:50,801 --> 00:13:52,136
THANKS FOR HELPING ME LOOK,

354
00:13:52,136 --> 00:13:53,837
MIKADO, I APPRECIATE YOU TRYING

355
00:13:53,837 --> 00:13:54,771
TO HELP.

356
00:13:54,771 --> 00:14:00,710
>> UH, BUT...

357
00:14:00,710 --> 00:14:02,646
YOU CAN STOP LOOKING, MASAOMI.

358
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:04,814
DON’T WORRY ABOUT WHO DID IT.

359
00:14:04,814 --> 00:14:07,083
NOT EXACTLY, SHE JUST DECIDED

360
00:14:07,083 --> 00:14:09,352
TO GO ON HOME.

361
00:14:09,352 --> 00:14:12,355
HUH? NO, I HAVE NO IDEA.

362
00:14:12,355 --> 00:14:14,390
ME? WELL, I’M STILL LOOKING OF

363
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:16,392
COURSE.

364
00:14:16,392 --> 00:14:19,227
ALL RIGHT, SEE YOU TOMORROW.

365
00:14:26,101 --> 00:14:28,670
THERE THEY ARE!

366
00:14:35,343 --> 00:14:37,165
>> WHAT AM I DOING?

367
00:14:41,348 --> 00:14:45,386
>> SEE? THAT’S WEIRD, ISN’T IT?

368
00:14:45,386 --> 00:14:46,387
I DON’T REMEMBER WHAT WAS HERE

369
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,654
AT ALL.

370
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:50,391
EMPTY LOTS KIND OF TRIP ME OUT.

371
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:51,758
ONCE THEY TEAR IT ALL DOWN IT’S

372
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:54,428
HARD TO REMEMBER WHAT WAS THERE.

373
00:14:54,428 --> 00:14:55,529
SOMETHING USED TO BE HERE,

374
00:14:55,529 --> 00:14:57,197
RIGHT?

375
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:00,400
I MEAN, LIKE SOMETHING BIG.

376
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,568
HM.

377
00:15:02,568 --> 00:15:05,238
>> WHAT AM I THINKING?

378
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,739
I GET ANNOYED WHEN SHINRA TELLS

379
00:15:06,739 --> 00:15:08,441
ME TO LET IT GO AND STOP LOOKING

380
00:15:08,441 --> 00:15:10,543
FOR MY HEAD.

381
00:15:10,543 --> 00:15:11,677
BUT LOOK AT ME.

382
00:15:11,677 --> 00:15:13,413
HERE I AM WITH A JOB AND MAKING

383
00:15:13,413 --> 00:15:15,615
FRIENDS.

384
00:15:15,615 --> 00:15:16,716
IT’S LIKE I’VE STARTED THINKING

385
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,519
I’M A HUMAN.

386
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:20,786
>> ANYWAY, YOU SAID YOU HAD

387
00:15:20,786 --> 00:15:21,821
SOMETHING YOU WANTED TO TALK TO

388
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:22,621
ME ABOUT.

389
00:15:22,621 --> 00:15:23,388
WHAT WAS IT?

390
00:15:29,461 --> 00:15:30,762
>> I REMEMBER!

391
00:15:30,762 --> 00:15:32,264
IT WAS A LONG, SKINNY BLUE

392
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:35,834
BUILDING, RIGHT?

393
00:15:35,834 --> 00:15:38,402
OH, YEAH, THAT OLD CRAPPY ONE.

394
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:39,470
THERE WAS AN OLD LADY ON THE

395
00:15:39,470 --> 00:15:41,539
FIRST FLOOR WHO SOLD CIGARETTES.

396
00:15:41,539 --> 00:15:45,476
WAY TO GO, TRANSPORTER.

397
00:15:45,476 --> 00:15:46,477
>> I KNOW MY HEAD IS IN THIS

398
00:15:46,477 --> 00:15:48,479
TOWN, I CAN FEEL IT.

399
00:15:48,479 --> 00:15:50,781
BUT...

400
00:16:00,858 --> 00:16:02,459
>> HUH?

401
00:16:02,459 --> 00:16:04,327
>> <i>BONGIORNO,</i> HOW ARE YOU?

402
00:16:04,327 --> 00:16:05,795
>> UH, ME?

403
00:16:05,795 --> 00:16:06,796
>> I LOOKED FOR SOMETHING

404
00:16:06,796 --> 00:16:08,431
BEAUTIFUL AND HOPING IN

405
00:16:08,431 --> 00:16:09,699
JAPANESE.

406
00:16:09,699 --> 00:16:11,568
GO ON, WHY YOU NOT WRITE DOWN

407
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,370
WHAT YOU LOOKING FOR DEEP DOWN

408
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:14,537
IN YOUR HEART?

409
00:16:14,537 --> 00:16:17,473
>> OH, WELL, I, UH...

410
00:16:17,473 --> 00:16:19,241
YOU KNOW, WOULD YOU MIND IF I

411
00:16:19,241 --> 00:16:20,476
TOOK A LOOK AT THAT?

412
00:16:20,476 --> 00:16:21,811
>> OKAY.

413
00:16:30,886 --> 00:16:33,689
>> OH.

414
00:16:33,689 --> 00:16:35,591
WONDER IF SHE FOUND HIM?

415
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:42,330
TODAY I ENDED UP LOOKING FOR ALL

416
00:16:42,330 --> 00:16:43,931
KINDS OF STUFF.

417
00:16:43,931 --> 00:16:46,434
BUT I FOUND SOME STUFF AND

418
00:16:46,434 --> 00:16:49,670
DIDN’T FIND SOME STUFF.

419
00:17:07,354 --> 00:17:09,723
[knock on door]

420
00:17:09,723 --> 00:17:11,625
>> HIS BAG WAS GONE SO I ASSUMED

421
00:17:11,625 --> 00:17:13,693
HE WAS ON A JOB.

422
00:17:13,693 --> 00:17:17,330
BUT SOMETHING JUST DIDN’T FEEL

423
00:17:17,330 --> 00:17:19,232
RIGHT.

424
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:28,006
>> FIREWORKS?

425
00:17:28,006 --> 00:17:29,007
>> YEAH, HE WENT ON QUITE A

426
00:17:29,007 --> 00:17:30,543
RAMPAGE.

427
00:17:30,543 --> 00:17:31,710
IT TOOK SEVERAL OF OUR GUYS TO

428
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:33,411
TAKE HIM DOWN.

429
00:17:33,411 --> 00:17:35,547
>> ALL FOR FIREWORKS?

430
00:17:35,547 --> 00:17:37,015
>> SEEMS TO ME LIKE YOUR STAFF

431
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:39,517
GOT A LITTLE OUT OF HAND.

432
00:17:39,517 --> 00:17:40,552
>> WELL, HE CAUSED QUITE A

433
00:17:40,552 --> 00:17:41,853
SCENE.

434
00:17:41,853 --> 00:17:43,688
KEPT SPOUTING SOME GIBBERISH

435
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,756
ABOUT HOW HIS GIRLFRIEND WAS

436
00:17:44,756 --> 00:17:46,591
KIDNAPPED AND THE ONLY THING

437
00:17:46,591 --> 00:17:47,625
SHE REMEMBERS FROM THAT NIGHT

438
00:17:47,625 --> 00:17:49,326
WAS THIS PLACE.

439
00:17:49,326 --> 00:17:50,461
THEN HE DEMANDED WE TELL HIM

440
00:17:50,461 --> 00:17:51,528
WHAT WE DID TO HER.

441
00:17:51,528 --> 00:17:52,730
>> HE WASN’T SPOUTING GIBBERISH,

442
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:54,966
HE WAS TELLING THE TRUTH.

443
00:17:54,966 --> 00:17:56,533
>> ANYWAY, DOC, THINK YOU CAN

444
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,302
FIX IT? MAKE IT SO THAT HE

445
00:17:58,302 --> 00:17:59,703
DOESN’T REMEMBER THIS PLACE WHEN

446
00:17:59,703 --> 00:18:01,004
HE WAKES UP?

447
00:18:01,004 --> 00:18:02,339
THAT’S ALL THAT WE’RE ASKING OF

448
00:18:02,339 --> 00:18:03,674
YOU, OKAY?

449
00:18:03,674 --> 00:18:04,841
>> THERE’S NO EASY WAY TO DO

450
00:18:04,841 --> 00:18:06,710
THAT, MEMORIES ARE A TRICKY

451
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,944
THING TO GET RID OF.

452
00:18:07,944 --> 00:18:10,681
AND PLUS, I’LL REMEMBER THIS

453
00:18:10,681 --> 00:18:11,715
KID.

454
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:12,749
>> LISTEN, WE ARE GONNA RELEASE

455
00:18:12,749 --> 00:18:15,685
HIM, BUT WHETHER HE WILL GO HOME

456
00:18:15,685 --> 00:18:17,653
OR NOT I’M NOT SO SURE.

457
00:18:22,725 --> 00:18:24,694
ALL RIGHT, LET’S BE CLEAR,

458
00:18:24,694 --> 00:18:25,861
DOCTOR.

459
00:18:25,861 --> 00:18:27,062
THE CHIEF AND I BOTH TRUST YOU

460
00:18:27,062 --> 00:18:29,098
COMPLETELY.

461
00:18:29,098 --> 00:18:30,565
AFTER ALL, YOU ARE KEEPING THAT

462
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:32,001
THING A SECRET.

463
00:18:32,001 --> 00:18:34,069
OH, AND BY THE WAY, THAT

464
00:18:34,069 --> 00:18:36,438
ROOMMATE YOU HAVE, SHE IS MORE

465
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:37,539
THAN JUST YOUR AVERAGE

466
00:18:37,539 --> 00:18:41,410
HOUSEGUEST, ISN’T SHE?

467
00:18:41,410 --> 00:18:42,411
>> AT THAT MOMENT MY FOCUS

468
00:18:42,411 --> 00:18:45,079
SHIFTED.

469
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:47,515
I WASN’T THINKING ABOUT MY HEAD,

470
00:18:47,515 --> 00:18:48,482
NOR THE CENTURY WORTH OF

471
00:18:48,482 --> 00:18:49,650
DULLAHAN MEMORIES THAT LIVE

472
00:18:49,650 --> 00:18:52,753
INSIDE IT.

473
00:18:52,753 --> 00:18:54,922
I WASN’T THINKING OF ANYTHING...

474
00:18:54,922 --> 00:18:57,958
EXCEPT THAT.

475
00:19:14,607 --> 00:19:16,643
>> HEY, WILL YOU COME EAT WITH

476
00:19:16,643 --> 00:19:18,144
ME?

477
00:19:18,144 --> 00:19:19,912
THE RESTAURANT WON’T COMPLAIN

478
00:19:19,912 --> 00:19:22,381
IF I ORDER DINNER FOR TWO.

479
00:19:22,381 --> 00:19:24,516
I KNOW A REALLY GREAT PLACE.

480
00:19:24,516 --> 00:19:26,552
PLEASE, CELTY.

481
00:19:26,552 --> 00:19:27,887
TO BE HONEST, I HATE EATING BY

482
00:19:27,887 --> 00:19:31,723
MYSELF.

483
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:32,858
WHAT IS THIS CONVOLUTED

484
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,793
MYSTERY FOOD IN FRONT OF ME?

485
00:19:38,964 --> 00:19:41,432
>> FRIED CHICKEN SUSHI, CHEESE

486
00:19:41,432 --> 00:19:44,435
SUSHI, MABO SUSHI, PROSCIUTTO

487
00:19:44,435 --> 00:19:46,004
SUSHI, AND THIS...

488
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:47,538
THIS SOUR CREAM SUSHI.

489
00:19:47,538 --> 00:19:48,506
>> NONE OF THIS SHOULD EVER BE

490
00:19:48,506 --> 00:19:49,607
SUSHI!

491
00:19:49,607 --> 00:19:51,109
>> WHY IT WRONG? IT IS SPECIAL

492
00:19:51,109 --> 00:19:55,880
PLATE, AND IT GOOD PRICE!

493
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:57,147
>> THEY’RE SERVING FORTUNE

494
00:19:57,147 --> 00:19:58,549
COOKIES FOR DESSERT?

495
00:19:58,549 --> 00:20:01,118
COME ON, YOU GOTTA BE KIDDING.

496
00:20:01,118 --> 00:20:02,787
YOU’VE SEEN THESE BEFORE, RIGHT?

497
00:20:02,787 --> 00:20:04,054
THERE’S A PIECE OF PAPER INSIDE

498
00:20:04,054 --> 00:20:06,456
THAT TELLS YOU A FORTUNE.

499
00:20:06,456 --> 00:20:07,191
LET’S SEE WHAT IT SAYS.

500
00:20:07,191 --> 00:20:09,526
THIS ONE’S YOURS.

501
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,634
LET ME SEE.

502
00:20:17,634 --> 00:20:18,568
HM.

503
00:20:18,568 --> 00:20:20,604
WELL, ACCORDING TO YOUR FORTUNE,

504
00:20:20,604 --> 00:20:21,671
YOU’RE GOING TO FIND WHAT YOU’RE

505
00:20:21,671 --> 00:20:22,706
LOOKING FOR.

506
00:20:22,706 --> 00:20:24,974
MM, EASY.

507
00:20:24,974 --> 00:20:26,175
I’M NOT USED TO YOU BEING SO

508
00:20:26,175 --> 00:20:28,544
HAPPY.

509
00:20:39,588 --> 00:20:41,089
>> I’M VERY HAPPY, SHINRA.

510
00:20:41,089 --> 00:20:42,024
>> OH.

511
00:20:42,024 --> 00:20:44,026
