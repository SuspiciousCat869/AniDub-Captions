>> FROM THE SECOND I SAW HIM,

355
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,334
I HATED HIM.

356
00:13:21,334 --> 00:13:22,334
>> TO BE HONEST, HE’S NOT REALLY

357
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:23,369
GOOD AT ALL.

358
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:25,004
>> THAT ISN’T NICE, SHINRA.

359
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:26,205
>> NO, NO.

360
00:13:26,205 --> 00:13:28,006
I MEANT THAT IN A GOOD WAY.

361

>> OH, YEAH?

364
00:13:34,845 --> 00:13:35,913
TOO BAD.

365
00:13:35,913 --> 00:13:37,147
I WAS THINKING YOU AND I COULD

366
00:13:37,147 --> 00:13:39,283
HAVE SOME REAL FUN TOGETHER.

367
00:13:39,283 --> 00:13:40,450

ISN’T THIS A BLAST?

373
00:14:00,402 --> 00:14:01,336
>> HMM.

374
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:02,904
>> AND THAT WAS IT.

375
00:14:02,904 --> 00:14:03,938
WE’VE BEEN TRYING TO KILL EACH

00:14:03,938 --> 00:14:05,072
OTHER FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY

377
00:14:05,072 --> 00:14:06,207
WE MET.

378
00:14:06,207 --> 00:14:07,975
THERE’S NO GOOD REASON.

379
00:14:07,975 --> 00:14:10,411
I JUST DON’T LIKE HIM, BUT...

380
00:14:10,411 --> 00:14:12,979
[tires screeching, crash]

381

00:14:17,917 --> 00:14:18,518
>> IT’S ALL RIGHT.

383
00:14:18,518 --> 00:14:19,552
DON’T WORRY.

384
00:14:19,552 --> 00:14:21,053
HE’S QUITE VIRILE.

385
00:14:21,053 --> 00:14:22,922
>> UH, ARE YOU SURE WE SHOULDN’T

386
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,123
TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL?

387
00:14:24,123 --> 00:14:26,058
>> NO, NO, HE’LL BE FINE.

388
00:14:26,058 --> 00:14:26,958
THAT’LL BE ALL.

389

391
00:14:31,262 --> 00:14:33,998
I SCREWED UP.

395
00:14:43,106 --> 00:14:44,941
IZAYA’S HERE AS WELL.

396
00:14:44,941 --> 00:14:46,142
>> INTERESTING.

397
00:14:46,142 --> 00:14:48,010
HOW ARE YOU STILL STANDING?

398
00:14:48,010 --> 00:14:48,911
>> [groans]

399
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:49,979
YOU’RE DEAD. YOU’RE DEAD.

400
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:51,280
THAT STARTED A WHOLE CHAIN OF

401
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,314
EVENTS.

402
00:14:52,314 --> 00:14:55,550
YOU ARE SO FREAKIN’ DEAD!

403
00:14:55,550 --> 00:14:56,251

AND SOON EVERY GANG OF REJECTS

406
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:01,422
IN THE CITY TRIED TO JUMP ME.

407
00:15:01,422 --> 00:15:03,057
I HADN’T DONE ANYTHING.

408
00:15:03,057 --> 00:15:04,024
ALL I WAS TRYING TO DO WAS LIVE

409
00:15:04,024 --> 00:15:07,494
A NICE, PEACEFUL LIFE.

410
00:15:07,494 --> 00:15:09,629
DAMN IT, DAMN IT, DAMN IT...

411
00:15:09,629 --> 00:15:11,998
I’M SO PISSED OFF.

HE WAS THE ONE SICCING THESE

419
00:15:55,536 --> 00:15:57,338
BASTARDS ON ME.

420
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:58,706
WHEN I REALIZED THAT...

421
00:15:58,706 --> 00:16:00,608
IZAYA!

00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:03,343
[explosion]

423
00:16:03,343 --> 00:16:05,012

RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

425
00:16:06,179 --> 00:16:09,682
DAMN IT!

426
00:16:09,682 --> 00:16:12,618
AFTER WE GRADUATED FROM RAIRA...

427
00:16:12,618 --> 00:16:15,387
>> SO WHAT YOU THINK?

428
00:16:15,387 --> 00:16:16,722

SOMETHING WITH THE YAKUZA.

432
00:16:21,226 --> 00:16:22,493
BUT FOR A WHILE THERE, THINGS

433
00:16:22,493 --> 00:16:24,429
WERE QUIET.

434
00:16:24,429 --> 00:16:25,663
SO WHAT DID I DO?

435
00:16:25,663 --> 00:16:30,100
[growls angrily]

YEAH, NONE OF THAT WORKED OUT

439
00:16:41,710 --> 00:16:43,612
TOO WELL.

440
00:16:45,613 --> 00:16:46,581

SORRY...

469
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:00,146
I DIDN’T MEAN TO BREAK MY

JUNIOR HIGH.

475
00:18:11,456 --> 00:18:12,290

DEBT-COLLECTION AGENCY AND

477
00:18:13,458 --> 00:18:15,092
WANTED MY HELP.

478
00:18:15,092 --> 00:18:17,829
BASICALLY, I BECAME THE MUSCLE.

479
00:18:17,829 --> 00:18:19,596
I WASN’T INTO IT AT FIRST.

480
00:18:19,596 --> 00:18:21,232

00:18:32,307 --> 00:18:33,575
THAT WAS ALSO AROUND THE SAME

489
00:18:33,575 --> 00:18:35,144

DUDE, WE WENT TO PUBLIC SCHOOL.

507
00:19:25,854 --> 00:19:27,190
I DON’T KNOW ANY OF THAT CRAP.

508
