EVER COME TO FRUITION.

176
00:06:30,852 --> 00:06:31,820
IT’S FANTASTIC!

177
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:33,021
A SITUATION THAT STARTED OUT SO

178
00:06:33,021 --> 00:06:34,555
LONG AGO AS UNREQUITED LOVE HAS

179
00:06:34,555 --> 00:06:35,623
BLOSSOMED INTO A HEALTHY

180

MY HEART IS BURSTING WITH JOY

RIGHT NOW!

184
00:06:40,328 --> 00:06:41,329

185
00:06:41,329 --> 00:06:42,663
YOU’RE EMBARRASSING ME.

00:06:48,902 --> 00:06:51,638
ALLOW THIS RELATIONSHIP?

192

SOCIETY.

196
00:06:56,142 --> 00:06:57,744
ARE YOU AWARE OF THE FACT THAT

197
00:06:57,744 --> 00:06:59,278
YOU ARE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS

198
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:00,279
A MONSTER?

199
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,713
>> OF COURSE.

200
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:03,649
>> "OF COURSE," SHE SAYS.

201
00:07:03,649 --> 00:07:04,616
>> SO WHAT?

202
00:07:04,616 --> 00:07:07,185
I FAIL TO SEE THE PROBLEM.

THAT SHE’S A SOCIAL MISFIT HAS

206

MORE IMPORTANTLY...

I’LL ALLOW IT.

215

HOWEVER, IT IS ONLY ON ONE

216

HAVE ALREADY FORGOTTEN IT.

251
00:08:26,225 --> 00:08:27,692
IT WAS THAT KIND OF NEGLIGENT

252
00:08:27,692 --> 00:08:28,860
BEHAVIOR, CELTY, THAT ALLOWED ME

00:11:25,122 --> 00:11:28,892
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING.

347
00:11:30,594 --> 00:11:32,561
>> THE SLASHER?

348
00:11:32,561 --> 00:11:35,298
SORRY, NO CLUE.

349
00:11:35,298 --> 00:11:36,365
>> I SEE.

350
00:11:36,365 --> 00:11:37,833
>> LISTEN...

351
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:38,534
WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?

352
00:11:38,534 --> 00:11:39,835
YOU SHOULDN’T BE BUSTIN’ YOUR

353
00:11:39,835 --> 00:11:41,837
ASS SO HARD FOR THE DOLLARS.

354
00:11:41,837 --> 00:11:42,905
>> WELL, I’M NOT DOING THIS JUST

355
00:11:42,905 --> 00:11:44,206
FOR THE DOLLARS.

356
00:11:44,206 --> 00:11:45,440
>> I’VE GOT A SCORE TO SETTLE

357
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,075
WITH WHOEVER’S BEHIND ALL THIS.

358
00:11:47,075 --> 00:11:50,011
[metallic whoosh]

359
00:11:50,011 --> 00:11:51,045
>> HM.

360
00:11:51,045 --> 00:11:53,180
IF I ACTUALLY HAD A HEAD, I’D BE

361
00:11:53,180 --> 00:11:54,548
DEAD NOW.

362
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:55,616
>> DUMBASS...

363
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:56,483
>> HUH?

364
00:11:56,483 --> 00:11:57,384
>> ANYONE WHO CALLS YOU A

365
00:11:57,384 --> 00:11:59,120
DUMBASS IS A BIGGER DUMBASS,

366
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,121
AND SINCE I KNOW I’M A DUMBASS,

367
00:12:00,121 --> 00:12:01,322
I’LL SAY IT!

368
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,022
DUMBASS!

369
00:12:02,022 --> 00:12:03,957
>> WHY DIDN’T YOU TELL ME THIS?

370
00:12:03,957 --> 00:12:05,158
I’LL KILL ’EM.

371
00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,426
WHOEVER IT IS, I’LL KILL ’EM

372
00:12:06,426 --> 00:12:07,928
DEAD!

373
00:12:07,928 --> 00:12:09,029
I’LL KILL ’EM DEADER THAN DEAD!

374
00:12:09,029 --> 00:12:10,596
>> WAIT, CALM DOWN.

375
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,265
I’M THE HEADLESS RIDER.

376
00:12:12,265 --> 00:12:13,966
NOTHING HAPPENED TO ME.

377
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:15,034
>> NO, NO, NO!

378
00:12:15,034 --> 00:12:16,335
THAT’S NOT THE POINT.

379
00:12:16,335 --> 00:12:17,603
IF SOMEONE PULLS A KNIFE ON YOU,

380
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:18,871
THEN YOU HAVE TO KILL THE

381
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,906
BASTARD!

382
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:22,607
KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL...

383
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:23,542
>> WHAT ABOUT YOUR JOB?

384
00:12:23,542 --> 00:12:24,476
YOU’RE JUST ON A BREAK RIGHT

385
00:12:24,476 --> 00:12:25,076
NOW.

386
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:26,645
>> WHO THE HELL CARES?

387
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:28,413
>> LISTEN, IT’S ALL RIGHT.

388
00:12:28,413 --> 00:12:29,648
I’M NOT GONNA LET YOU GET FIRED

389
00:12:29,648 --> 00:12:30,581
BECAUSE OF ME.

390
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,615
BESIDES IF I’M GOING TO GO AFTER

391
00:12:31,615 --> 00:12:32,984
THE SLASHER, I NEED TO GET SOME

392
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:34,652
INFORMATION FIRST.

393
00:12:34,652 --> 00:12:35,919
SO BEFORE YOU DO ANYTHING RASH,

394
00:12:35,919 --> 00:12:41,224
LET ME GET ALL THAT IN ORDER.

395
00:12:41,224 --> 00:12:42,960
>> ALL RIGHT, THEN.

396
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,663
FINE, BUT DO IT QUICK, OKAY?

397
00:12:46,663 --> 00:12:50,433
KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL, KILL...

398
00:12:50,433 --> 00:12:51,901
>> THERE WAS A REASON I LEFT

399
00:12:51,901 --> 00:12:54,871
SHIZUO ALONE FOR A WHILE.

400
00:13:01,477 --> 00:13:03,111
>> WELL, NOW...

401
00:13:03,111 --> 00:13:04,513
I’M GLAD THAT YOU DECIDED TO

402
00:13:04,513 --> 00:13:06,114
COME AND SEE ME.

403
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:07,348
SO TELL ME, DID YOU EVER FIND

404
00:13:07,348 --> 00:13:09,684
YOUR HEAD?

405
00:13:09,684 --> 00:13:12,320
>> THAT’S NOT WHY I’M HERE.

406
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:13,554
I’LL MAKE THIS QUICK.

407
00:13:13,554 --> 00:13:14,455
I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT THE

408
00:13:14,455 --> 00:13:15,490
SLASHER.

409
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,491
>> I’LL ONLY CHARGE YOU THREE

410
00:13:16,491 --> 00:13:21,528
BILLS FOR THAT.

411
00:13:23,263 --> 00:13:24,564
I’M GUESSIN’ YOUR CLOTHES AND

412
00:13:24,564 --> 00:13:25,632
WALLET ARE MADE OF THAT SHADOWY

413
00:13:25,632 --> 00:13:27,233
STUFF TOO.

414
00:13:27,233 --> 00:13:28,468
SO IF THAT’S THE CASE, IF I WERE

415
00:13:28,468 --> 00:13:29,569
TO SHINE A REALLY BRIGHT

416
00:13:29,569 --> 00:13:31,037
SPOTLIGHT ON YOU, WOULD I BE

417
00:13:31,037 --> 00:13:32,371
ABLE TO SEE YOU NAKED?

418
00:13:32,371 --> 00:13:34,073
>> WANNA TRY IT?

419
00:13:34,073 --> 00:13:35,474
>> NO, NOT REALLY.

420
00:13:35,474 --> 00:13:37,042
SEE, UNLIKE A CERTAIN

421
00:13:37,042 --> 00:13:38,411
UNDERGROUND DOCTOR WE BOTH KNOW,

422
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:40,345
I’M NO PERVERT.

423
00:13:40,345 --> 00:13:41,513
I CAN’T GET IT UP FOR A CHICK

424
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:42,547
WITHOUT A HEAD OR EVEN A CHICK

425
00:13:42,547 --> 00:13:45,984
WITHOUT A BODY.

426
00:13:45,984 --> 00:13:47,619
>> SAY WHAT YOU WANT ABOUT ME.

427
00:13:47,619 --> 00:13:49,086
BUT INSULT SHINRA AGAIN AND IT

428
00:13:49,086 --> 00:13:50,688
WON’T GO WELL.

429
00:13:50,688 --> 00:13:52,023
>> [laughs]

430
00:13:52,023 --> 00:13:56,027
SO YOU TWO ARE IN LOVE.

431
00:13:56,027 --> 00:13:57,294
YOU KNOW I WONDER...

432
00:13:57,294 --> 00:13:58,595
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF ANOTHER

433
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:00,664
DULLAHAN WERE TO COME ALONG?

434
00:14:00,664 --> 00:14:02,098
SHINRA MIGHT FALL FOR HER IN A

435
00:14:02,098 --> 00:14:04,100
SECOND.

436
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,335
>> I’D LIKE TO THINK THAT’S NOT

437
00:14:05,335 --> 00:14:06,569
POSSIBLE.

438
00:14:06,569 --> 00:14:07,603
HOWEVER, IF IT DID HAPPEN...

439
00:14:07,603 --> 00:14:09,072
>> YOU’D KILL SHINRA AND THEN

440
00:14:09,072 --> 00:14:09,672
YOURSELF?

441
00:14:09,672 --> 00:14:11,141
>> NO, I JUST WOULDN’T LET

442
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:12,508
ANOTHER HEADLESS WOMAN GET CLOSE

443
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:15,678
TO HIM.

444
00:14:15,678 --> 00:14:20,549
I MEAN, I REALLY DO LOVE HIM.

445
00:14:20,549 --> 00:14:22,651
>> [laughs]

446
00:14:22,651 --> 00:14:25,420
SURE DIDN’T SEE THAT COMING.

447
00:14:25,420 --> 00:14:26,588
YOU’RE BECOMING MORE AND

448
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:28,089
MORE HUMAN EVERY DAY.

449
00:14:28,089 --> 00:14:29,523
JUST BE CAREFUL, THOUGH.

450
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:30,759
I’D HATE FOR YOU TO REALIZE ALL

451
00:14:30,759 --> 00:14:32,326
THIS ATTENTION YOU’VE PUT TOWARD

452
00:14:32,326 --> 00:14:33,627
BECOMING MORE HUMAN HAS CREATED

453
00:14:33,627 --> 00:14:34,695
A MUCH BIGGER GAP BETWEEN YOUR

454
00:14:34,695 --> 00:14:38,065
HEAD AND YOUR NECK.

455
00:14:38,065 --> 00:14:39,299
>> I’LL WORRY ABOUT THAT ONCE I

456
00:14:39,299 --> 00:14:41,534
GET MY HEAD BACK.

457
00:14:41,534 --> 00:14:42,635
TO BE HONEST, I’VE BEEN THINKING

458
00:14:42,635 --> 00:14:46,639
I DON’T REALLY NEED IT ANYMORE.

459
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,308
ALL RIGHT, ENOUGH ABOUT THIS.

460
00:14:48,308 --> 00:14:49,276
TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THE

461
00:14:49,276 --> 00:14:50,343
SLASHER.

462
00:14:50,343 --> 00:14:51,611
DON’T TAKE MY MONEY AND THEN

463
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:54,013
TELL ME YOU DON’T KNOW ANYTHING.

464
00:14:54,013 --> 00:14:55,581
>> DON’T WORRY, IT’S ALL GOOD.

465
00:14:55,581 --> 00:14:56,715
I’VE GOT SOME INFO THAT NEITHER

466
00:14:56,715 --> 00:14:58,184
THE COPS, THE MEDIA OR EVEN THE

467
00:14:58,184 --> 00:14:59,618
NET KNOWS OF.

468
00:14:59,618 --> 00:15:01,119
ACTUALLY, I’VE BEEN WAITING TO

469
00:15:01,119 --> 00:15:02,421
SHARE IT WITH YOU.

470
00:15:02,421 --> 00:15:04,055
>> WHY ME?

471
00:15:04,055 --> 00:15:05,423
>> HM.

472
00:15:05,423 --> 00:15:06,591
BECAUSE THERE’S A PRETERNATURAL

473
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:08,626
ELEMENT TO THE SLASHER.

474
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:10,395
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD OF A

475
00:15:10,395 --> 00:15:11,796
SWORD CALLED SAIKA?

476
00:15:11,796 --> 00:15:13,063
>> SAIKA?

477
00:15:13,063 --> 00:15:14,298
>> I KNOW THAT IT SOUNDS A

478
00:15:14,298 --> 00:15:15,566
LITTLE ODD, BUT SAIKA IS A

479
00:15:15,566 --> 00:15:16,667
DEMONIC BLADE THAT USED TO

480
00:15:16,667 --> 00:15:18,736
EXIST HERE IN SHINJUKU.

481
00:15:18,736 --> 00:15:20,204
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN "DEMONIC

482
00:15:20,204 --> 00:15:21,105
BLADE?"

483
00:15:21,105 --> 00:15:22,406
LIKE THE MURAMASA?

484
00:15:22,406 --> 00:15:23,607
>> YES.

485
00:15:23,607 --> 00:15:24,674
IT’S A SWORD IMBUED WITH DARK

486
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:28,344
MAGIC.

487
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,179
>> HEY, WHAT’S GOING ON?

488
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:31,447
>> IZAYA TOLD ME ABOUT THIS

489
00:15:31,447 --> 00:15:33,649
DEMONIC BLADE CALLED SAIKA.

490
00:15:33,649 --> 00:15:35,418
ACCORDING TO LEGEND IT HAS A

491
00:15:35,418 --> 00:15:36,785
MIND OF ITS OWN.

492
00:15:36,785 --> 00:15:38,253
AND USES ITS POWER TO POSSES

493
00:15:38,253 --> 00:15:40,589
HUMANS.

494
00:15:40,589 --> 00:15:41,657
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT EVERY

495
00:15:41,657 --> 00:15:43,091
VICTIM HAS MADE MENTION OF WAS

496
00:15:43,091 --> 00:15:44,792
THAT THE SLASHER’S EYES WERE

497
00:15:44,792 --> 00:15:46,461
RED.

498
00:15:46,461 --> 00:15:48,195
>> SO, DO YOU THINK THAT

499
00:15:48,195 --> 00:15:49,196
SAIKA DID THIS?

500
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:51,198
>> YEAH.

501
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,499
EVERY TIME THERE’S BEEN A

502
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,668
SLASHER ATTACK, SOMEONE WITH THE

503
00:15:53,668 --> 00:15:55,102
USER NAME SAIKA SHOWS UP ON THE

504
00:15:55,102 --> 00:15:57,338
NET.

505
00:15:57,338 --> 00:15:59,140
>> HUM.

506
00:15:59,140 --> 00:15:59,806
>> WHAT BOTHERS ME THOUGH IS

507
00:15:59,806 --> 00:16:01,775
THAT WHEN I WAS ATTACKED, I

508
00:16:01,775 --> 00:16:03,076
DIDN’T SENSE IT APPROACHING AT

509
00:16:03,076 --> 00:16:04,077
ALL.

510
00:16:04,077 --> 00:16:05,378
IF SAIKA TRULY ISN’T HUMAN, THEN

511
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:06,646
I SHOULD HAVE FELT A PRESENCE OR

512
00:16:06,646 --> 00:16:09,382
SOMETHING.

513
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:10,650
>> YES, BUT SAIKA IS JUST TAKING

514
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:11,751
OVER THEIR MINDS, THEREFORE THE

515
00:16:11,751 --> 00:16:13,319
BEING THAT APPROACHED WAS MAINLY

516
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:15,254
HUMAN.

517
00:16:15,254 --> 00:16:16,555
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU

518
00:16:16,555 --> 00:16:17,723
DIDN’T SENSE A SUPERNATURAL

519
00:16:17,723 --> 00:16:19,558
PRESENCE AT THE TIME.

520
00:16:19,558 --> 00:16:20,792
>> SHINRA, YOU SEEM TO KNOW A

521
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:23,595
LOT ABOUT SAIKA.

522
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:24,629
>> I DO?

523
00:16:24,629 --> 00:16:25,664
WELL, YOU TOLD ME TO LOOK INTO

524
00:16:25,664 --> 00:16:26,765
IT, SO I DID.

525
00:16:26,765 --> 00:16:28,532
ALL RIGHT, HURRY UP AND COME TO

526
00:16:28,532 --> 00:16:33,437
BED.

527
00:16:33,437 --> 00:16:35,339
>> I COULDN’T HELP BUT THINK

528
00:16:35,339 --> 00:16:37,375
SHINRA WAS HIDING SOMETHING.

529
00:16:43,746 --> 00:16:44,481
[gun cocks]

530
00:16:44,481 --> 00:16:47,317
>> [gasps]

531
00:16:47,317 --> 00:16:49,519
>> HELLO, WELCOME BACK.

532
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:50,687
WHEN MS. NAMNIA HERE DISAPPEARED

533
00:16:50,687 --> 00:16:53,389
AFTER THE MERGER WITH NEBRACORE

534
00:16:53,389 --> 00:16:54,656
I DECIDED TO DO A LITTLE

535
00:16:54,656 --> 00:16:56,325
INVESTIGATING.

536
00:16:56,325 --> 00:16:57,626
AND IN MY RESEARCH, I DISCOVERED

537
00:16:57,626 --> 00:16:58,494
THAT SHE VISITS YOU NOW ON A

538
00:16:58,494 --> 00:16:59,695
REGULAR BASIS.

539
00:16:59,695 --> 00:17:01,196
SO WITH A LITTLE ENCOURAGEMENT

540
00:17:01,196 --> 00:17:02,430
FROM MY TOY GUN, SHE WAS KIND

541
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:04,365
ENOUGH TO ESCORT ME IN.

542
00:17:04,365 --> 00:17:05,734
>> YOUR TOY GUN?

543
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:07,802
>> OH, DID I NOT MENTION THAT?

544
00:17:07,802 --> 00:17:08,669
[gunshot]

545
00:17:08,669 --> 00:17:09,737
>> I WANT TO REPORT THIS BASTARD

546
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,772
TO THE POLICE.

547
00:17:11,772 --> 00:17:12,707
>> REALLY?

548
00:17:12,707 --> 00:17:13,741
WOULDN’T YOU BE THE ONES IN HOT

549
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,843
WATER IF THAT HAPPENS?

550
00:17:15,843 --> 00:17:17,144
MY TESTIMONY MAY LEAD THE POLICE

551
00:17:17,144 --> 00:17:18,445
TO SEARCH THIS ROOM, WHERE

552
00:17:18,445 --> 00:17:19,713
THEY’LL FIND THE BLOODY HEAD OF

553
00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:21,781
A POOR YOUNG WOMAN.

554
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:23,250
WHO KNOWS, MAYBE THAT WILL BE

555
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,551
EVEN BIGGER NEWS THAN THE

556
00:17:24,551 --> 00:17:26,786
SLASHER CURRENTLY IS.

557
00:17:26,786 --> 00:17:27,854
>> SO...

558
00:17:27,854 --> 00:17:29,522
NOW I SEE WHERE SHINRA GETS HIS

559
00:17:29,522 --> 00:17:31,890
LOVELY TWISTED DISPOSITION.

560
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:32,791
>> FLATTERY WILL GET YOU

561
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,193
NOWHERE.

562
00:17:34,193 --> 00:17:35,361
TO BE HONEST, I’M IN NO RUSH TO

563
00:17:35,361 --> 00:17:39,264
RECOVER THE HEAD JUST YET.

564
00:17:39,264 --> 00:17:40,565
>> HUH?

565
00:17:40,565 --> 00:17:41,834
>> THE EXECUTIVES AT MY COMPANY

566
00:17:41,834 --> 00:17:42,935
WERE QUITE TAKEN ABACK BY

567
00:17:42,935 --> 00:17:46,804
CELTY’S LITTLE TELEVISION DEBUT.

568
00:17:46,804 --> 00:17:47,905
AND, NOW THEY’RE FAR MORE

569
00:17:47,905 --> 00:17:49,407
INTERESTED IN STUDDING THE BODY

570
00:17:49,407 --> 00:17:51,843
AT THIS POINT THAN THE HEAD.

571
00:17:51,843 --> 00:17:52,744
>> WHAT?

572
00:17:52,744 --> 00:17:53,744
>> SO THAT’S WHY I TOLD THE

573
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:54,912
COMPANY THAT I WOULD INVESTIGATE

574
00:17:54,912 --> 00:17:57,214
THE HEAD ON MY OWN.

575
00:17:59,283 --> 00:18:00,617
AFTER ALL, I THINK THE APPROACH

576
00:18:00,617 --> 00:18:01,885
YOU HAVE TAKEN TO THIS UNIQUE

577
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:05,355
MATTER IS VERY INTERESTING.

578
00:18:05,355 --> 00:18:06,456
IN YOUR THEORY, DULLAHANS ARE

579
00:18:06,456 --> 00:18:08,758
ACTUALLY A TYPE OF VALKYRIE.

580
00:18:08,758 --> 00:18:10,426
YOU’RE HOPING TO INVOLVE THE

581
00:18:10,426 --> 00:18:11,694
HEAD IN SOME SORT OF STRUGGLE OR

582
00:18:11,694 --> 00:18:13,395
CONFLICT...

583
00:18:13,395 --> 00:18:14,429
SO YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO ROUSE IT

584
00:18:14,429 --> 00:18:16,398
INTO CONSCIOUSNESS, HM?

585
00:18:16,398 --> 00:18:17,699
>> WELL, I’VE TRIED MANY

586
00:18:17,699 --> 00:18:19,234
APPROACHES.

587
00:18:19,234 --> 00:18:20,269
BUT IF ALL ELSE FAILS I MAY HAVE

588
00:18:20,269 --> 00:18:21,536
NO CHOICE BUT TO BRING THAT HEAD

589
00:18:21,536 --> 00:18:23,505
INTO A WARZONE.

590
00:18:23,505 --> 00:18:24,806
REGARDLESS THOUGH, I WOULD BE

591
00:18:24,806 --> 00:18:26,240
HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS

592
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,275
IF THAT IS INDEED WHY YOU CAME

593
00:18:27,275 --> 00:18:29,243
HERE.

594
00:18:29,243 --> 00:18:30,344
>> EXCELLENT.

595
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,579
I’VE HAD MY EYE ON YOU FOR QUITE

596
00:18:31,579 --> 00:18:33,281
SOME TIME.

597
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:34,348
NOBODY ELSE THOUGHT TO LOOK AT

598
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,716
THIS FROM A MYTHOLOGICAL

599
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,418
STANDPOINT, NOT EVEN MYSELF.

600
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:39,486
I’M VERY IMPRESSED.

601
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:42,855
>> WHY, THANK YOU.

602
00:18:42,855 --> 00:18:44,224
>> BEFORE I GO, LET ME GIVE YOU

603
00:18:44,224 --> 00:18:45,858
ONE PIECE OF ADVICE.

604
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:47,294
>> IF YOU DO CREATE SOME SORT OF

605
00:18:47,294 --> 00:18:48,361
CONFLICT HERE IN TOKYO IN AN

606
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,930
EFFORT TO ROUSE CELTY’S HEAD, OR

607
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,464
HER SOUL, I WILL MAKE ONE

608
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:53,833
SUGGESTION.

609
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:55,334
INSTEAD OF PULLING CELTY INTO

610
00:18:55,334 --> 00:18:56,502
SOMEONE ELSE’S WAR, INSTEAD

611
00:18:56,502 --> 00:19:00,972
CREATE THE CONFLICT AROUND HER.

612
00:19:00,972 --> 00:19:02,674
AND WHOEVER SHOWS UP FOR THE

613
00:19:02,674 --> 00:19:06,945
FIGHT, THROW THEM INTO THE FIRE.

614
00:19:06,945 --> 00:19:10,348
>> THAT’S MY INTENTION.

615
00:19:10,348 --> 00:19:11,449
IN FACT, THINGS ARE PROGRESSING

616
00:19:11,449 --> 00:19:12,717
IN THAT DIRECTION FASTER THAN I

617
00:19:12,717 --> 00:19:15,285
THOUGHT.

618
00:19:16,821 --> 00:19:18,822
>> ANRI...

619
00:19:18,822 --> 00:19:20,257
>> I KNOW IT’S TIME FOR GYM

620
00:19:20,257 --> 00:19:23,293
CLASS NOW, BUT ARE YOU OKAY?

621
00:19:23,293 --> 00:19:23,793
>> I’M FINE.

622
00:19:23,793 --> 00:19:25,294
>> I’VE BEEN WORRIED.

623
00:19:25,294 --> 00:19:26,362
WHAT WERE YOU DOING WITH THOSE

624
00:19:26,362 --> 00:19:27,731
STUDENTS WHO WERE ATTACKED THE

625
00:19:27,731 --> 00:19:28,631
OTHER DAY?

626
00:19:28,631 --> 00:19:29,899
DON’T TELL ME THOSE GIRLS HAVE

627
00:19:29,899 --> 00:19:31,834
BEEN BULLYING YOU AGAIN.

628
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:33,402
I’M WORRIED, ANRI, REALLY

629
00:19:33,402 --> 00:19:35,003
WORRIED.

630
00:19:35,003 --> 00:19:36,472
WHO’S TO SAY THE SLASHER WON’T

631
00:19:36,472 --> 00:19:38,674
COME AFTER YOU AGAIN?

632
00:19:38,674 --> 00:19:39,842
YOU SHOULDN’T BE ALONE.

633
00:19:39,842 --> 00:19:40,675
>> SEXUALLY HARASSING HER

634
00:19:40,675 --> 00:19:42,344
AGAIN?

635
00:19:42,344 --> 00:19:43,345
NOW THAT’S JUST PLAIN NAUGHTY,

636
00:19:43,345 --> 00:19:43,811
TEACH.

637
00:19:43,811 --> 00:19:45,280
>> I’M SIMPLY CONCERNED FOR

638
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,381
ANRI’S SAFETY, THAT’S ALL.

639
00:19:46,381 --> 00:19:47,048
>> WHOA!

640
00:19:47,048 --> 00:19:48,349
SO YOU GUYS ARE TIGHT!

641
00:19:48,349 --> 00:19:50,818
THAT’S CRAZY DANGEROUS!

642
00:19:50,818 --> 00:19:52,319
DON’T GET TOO CONCERNED FOR HER,

643
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:53,420
OR SHE JUST MIGHT TRANSFER, LIKE

644
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:57,023
MISS NIEKAWA DID.

645
00:19:57,023 --> 00:19:58,525
DIDN’T THAT GIRL HAVE CLASSES

646
00:19:58,525 --> 00:19:59,493
WITH YOU LAST YEAR?

647
00:19:59,493 --> 00:20:01,494

SO THEN YOU KNOW NIEKAWA.

>> OH, JUST HER NAME.

651
00:20:08,368 --> 00:20:09,635
WELL, IT’S TIME FOR US STUDENTS

652
00:20:09,635 --> 00:20:13,706
TO BE HEADING HOME NOW.

653

00:20:15,941 --> 00:20:18,943
>> HEY, ANRI...

YOU, RIGHT?

661
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:30,488
>> I THINK MIKADO IS A NICE GUY

662
00:20:30,488 --> 00:20:33,457
AND A GOOD FRIEND.

663

I’M JUST GONNA BOW OUT OF THE

666

PICTURE FOR NOW, OKAY?

667
00:20:39,662 --> 00:20:40,964
PLUS, THERE’S CHICKS ALL OVER

668
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,432
THE WORLD WHO DESERVE A LITTLE

669
00:20:42,432 --> 00:20:44,434
TASTE OF MY LOVE, HEE-HEE.

679
00:20:58,714 --> 00:20:59,881
YOU GOT TO BAG ON ME WITH TERMS

>> SEE YOU TOMORROW!

684
00:21:09,557 --> 00:21:10,558
>> IT’S THE BOMB, BRO.

685
00:21:10,558 --> 00:21:11,859
>> JUST KEEP TELLING YOURSELF

686

689

>> HMH?

690
00:21:41,653 --> 00:21:42,920
>> ABOUT SAIKA, YOU SHOULD KNOW

691
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:47,825
THAT MY DAD HAD IT FOR A WHILE.

692
00:21:47,825 --> 00:21:49,060
BUT HE SOLD IT TO AN ANTIQUES

693
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:51,062
DEALER A FEW YEARS AGO.

694
00:21:51,062 --> 00:21:52,930
>> SHINGEN HAD IT?

695
00:21:52,930 --> 00:21:54,031
WHY?

696
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:56,400
>> BECAUSE, IT SAID THAT SAIKA’S

697
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,868
ABLE TO CUT SOULS.

698
00:21:57,868 --> 00:21:59,402
>> HUH?

699
00:21:59,402 --> 00:22:00,403
>> DID HE?

700
00:22:00,403 --> 00:22:01,872
>> YES.

701
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,539
HE’S THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

702
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:04,574
HE USED THE SAIKA TO STEAL YOUR

703
00:22:04,574 --> 00:22:05,675
HEAD.

704
00:22:05,675 --> 00:22:06,909
THAT’S HOW HE CUT THE SOUL THAT

705
00:22:06,909 --> 00:22:08,411
HELD YOUR HEAD AND BODY

706
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,479
TOGETHER.

709
00:22:12,815 --> 00:22:14,516
ALONG?

710
00:22:14,516 --> 00:22:15,517
>> SORT OF.

711
00:22:15,517 --> 00:22:16,551
BUT ONLY FOUND OUT HE USED IT TO

712
00:22:16,551 --> 00:22:17,786
TAKE YOUR HEAD WHEN I DID MY OWN

713
00:22:17,786 --> 00:22:19,788
RESEARCH LATER.

714
00:22:19,788 --> 00:22:20,922
I DIDN’T SAY ANYTHING AT

715
00:22:20,922 --> 00:22:22,491
FIRST BECAUSE IT SEEMED LIKE YOU

716
00:22:22,491 --> 00:22:23,625
WERE TRYING TO MOVE ON AND

717
00:22:23,625 --> 00:22:25,627
FORGET ABOUT YOUR HEAD.

718
00:22:25,627 --> 00:22:26,828
BUT...

719
00:22:26,828 --> 00:22:28,629
>> LISTEN...

720
00:22:28,629 --> 00:22:32,700
I NEED TO BE ALONE FOR A WHILE.

721
00:22:35,903 --> 00:22:38,671
>> OF COURSE YOU DO.

722
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,873
>> LOVE JUST CONFUSES THINGS.

723
00:22:40,873 --> 00:22:42,142
IT TURNS OUT THAT SAME NIGHT

724
00:22:42,142 --> 00:22:43,610
THERE WAS A CERTAIN GIRL SAIKA

725
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:45,845
