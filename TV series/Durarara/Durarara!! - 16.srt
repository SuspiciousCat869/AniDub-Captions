WANT TO PROVE YOUR LOVE, THEN

00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,637
AND NEITHER THAT MONSTER OR THE

514
00:17:09,637 --> 00:17:11,138
COPS HAS ANY CHANCE OF STOPPING

515
00:17:11,138 --> 00:17:11,738
US.

516
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,139
THEY’RE GONNA BE WAY TOO BUSY

517
00:17:13,139 --> 00:17:13,774
FOR THAT.

518
00:17:13,774 --> 00:17:14,740
YOU SEE, THIS KNIFE IS JUST

519
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:16,742
GETTING STARTED, BECAUSE NOT TOO

520
00:17:16,742 --> 00:17:18,310
FAR FROM HERE, MY SISTERS ARE

521
00:17:18,310 --> 00:17:20,145
OUT MAKING MORE SISTERS, NOW,

522
00:17:20,145 --> 00:17:22,446
HOW MUCH FUN IS THAT?

523
00:17:25,416 --> 00:17:29,552
[eerie warbling]

524
00:17:32,454 --> 00:17:34,423
>> CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

525
00:17:34,423 --> 00:17:36,391
>> WHATEVER YOU’D LIKE.

526
00:17:36,391 --> 00:17:37,725
>> WHY ME?

527
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:40,427
WHY DO YOU LIKE ME SO MUCH?

528
00:17:40,427 --> 00:17:42,362
>> ’CAUSE YOU’RE SO STRONG.

529
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:44,297
YOUR STRENGTH LITERALLY HAS NO

530
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,764
BOUNDARIES, AND WE WOULD LIKE IT

531
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,433
FOR OURSELVES.

532
00:17:47,433 --> 00:17:49,334
ALL THE BETTER TO LOVE HUMANITY

533
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:50,402
WITH.

534
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,769
WE LIKE SOMEONE WITH GOOD GENES

535
00:17:51,769 --> 00:17:54,138
THE SAME WAY THAT YOU HUMANS DO.

536
00:17:54,138 --> 00:17:56,473
COME ON, NOW, LET’S JUST BE

537
00:17:56,473 --> 00:17:57,641
HONEST HERE.

538
00:17:57,641 --> 00:17:58,641
ODDS ARE, A GUY LIKE YOU WILL

539
00:17:58,641 --> 00:18:00,810
NEVER FIND SOMEONE TO LOVE HIM.

540
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,378
EXCEPT US, WE WANT TO LOVE YOU,

541
00:18:03,378 --> 00:18:06,815
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US.

542
00:18:06,815 --> 00:18:12,252
>> [laughs]

543
00:18:14,253 --> 00:18:16,555
>> SHIZUO, SNAP OUT OF IT!

544
00:18:16,555 --> 00:18:17,823
IF THINGS GET OUT OF CONTROL,

545
00:18:17,823 --> 00:18:19,725
I’LL TAKE CARE OF IT, OKAY?

546
00:18:19,725 --> 00:18:21,392
>> NO, CELTY, THAT LAUGH WAS

547
00:18:21,392 --> 00:18:22,393
REAL.

548
00:18:22,393 --> 00:18:23,528
I’M KINDA GLAD ABOUT THIS.

549
00:18:23,528 --> 00:18:25,795
>> HUH?

550
00:18:25,795 --> 00:18:27,364
>> YOU DON’T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW

551
00:18:27,364 --> 00:18:28,531
MUCH I’VE HATED HAVING THIS

552
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:29,465
POWER.

553
00:18:29,465 --> 00:18:30,499
I’VE ALWAYS BEEN AFRAID THAT

554
00:18:30,499 --> 00:18:32,735
BECAUSE OF THIS, NOBODY WOULD

555
00:18:32,735 --> 00:18:35,170
EVER WANT ME.

556
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:37,304
BUT I WAS WRONG.

557
00:18:37,304 --> 00:18:39,173
ALL RIGHT, THEN, HOW MANY WE

558
00:18:39,173 --> 00:18:40,240
GOT?

559
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,208
LET’S JUST CALL IT A LOT.

560
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,310
SO NOW, THIS SHOULD DO IT.

561
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:47,346
YOU KNOW, I THINK I CAN FULLY

562
00:18:47,346 --> 00:18:50,214
EMBRACE WHO I AM NOW.

563
00:18:50,214 --> 00:18:52,883
FINALLY START LIKING MYSELF.

564
00:18:52,883 --> 00:18:54,652
I’VE HATED THIS POWER SO MUCH,

565
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:55,718
I’VE WANTED NOTHING MORE THAN TO

566
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:58,421
BE RID OF IT.

567
00:18:58,421 --> 00:19:01,657
NOW I CAN FINALLY GO ALL OUT.

568
00:19:01,657 --> 00:19:05,193
HEY, BY THE WAY, I JUST WANT TO

569
00:19:05,193 --> 00:19:07,227
MAKE ONE THING CLEAR.

570
00:19:07,227 --> 00:19:09,229
NONE OF YOU ARE MY TYPE.

571
00:19:09,229 --> 00:19:11,398
NEVER HAVE BEEN, AND NEVER WILL

572
00:19:11,398 --> 00:19:12,331
BE.

573
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:15,668
I HATE YOU GUYS, ALMOST AS MUCH

574
00:19:15,668 --> 00:19:16,969
AS IZAYA.

575
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,370
[charging yell]

576
00:19:19,671 --> 00:19:21,472
>> SHINRA, SOMETHING ELSE STILL

577
00:19:21,472 --> 00:19:22,806
BOTHERS ME.

578
00:19:22,806 --> 00:19:24,808
YOU SAID SAIKA DISAPPEARED FIVE

579
00:19:24,808 --> 00:19:26,943
YEARS AGO, RIGHT?

580
00:19:26,943 --> 00:19:28,578
WHY IS THAT?

581
00:19:28,578 --> 00:19:31,880
WHAT HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO?

582
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:33,715
>> WELL, I HIGHLY DOUBT IT CHOSE

583
00:19:33,715 --> 00:19:35,483
TO TAKE A VACATION.

584
00:19:35,483 --> 00:19:37,250
IT’S POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE VERY

585
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:39,352
STRONG CAME IN CONTACT WITH IT

586
00:19:39,352 --> 00:19:40,453
AND HAS SOMEHOW MANAGED TO

587
00:19:40,453 --> 00:19:41,454
SUPPRESS IT.

588
00:19:41,454 --> 00:19:42,388
[pants in fear]

589
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:43,755
>> WHO WOULD THAT BE?

590
00:19:43,755 --> 00:19:45,624
>> I’VE THOUGHT ABOUT YOU FOR SO

591
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:46,492
LONG.

592
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:48,359
I KNOW YOU LOVED ME AS MUCH AS I

593
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:49,360
LOVED YOU.

594
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:50,795
YOU SHOWED THAT IN THE WAY YOU

595
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,629
TRIED TO EXTORT MONEY FROM ME,

596
00:19:52,629 --> 00:19:54,464
AND HOW YOU TRIED TO ABANDON ME,

597
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:55,665
ONCE YOU GOT BORED.

598
00:19:55,665 --> 00:19:57,433
AND NO MATTER WHAT, I ACCEPTED

599
00:19:57,433 --> 00:19:59,301
YOU, I LOVED AND FORGAVE YOU.

600
00:19:59,301 --> 00:20:01,369
>> [whimpers]

601
00:20:01,369 --> 00:20:03,505
>> BUT STILL, THAT JUST WASN’T

602
00:20:03,505 --> 00:20:04,305
ENOUGH.

603
00:20:04,305 --> 00:20:05,940
NO, THAT WASN’T EVEN CLOSE TO

604
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:07,774
ENOUGH.

605
00:20:07,774 --> 00:20:10,376
ENTER SAIKA.

606
00:20:10,376 --> 00:20:11,877
SHE STARTED SPEAKING TO ME AND

607
00:20:11,877 --> 00:20:13,412
TELLING ME THINGS.

608
00:20:13,412 --> 00:20:14,446
>> [pants in fear]

>> THINGS LIKE THIS.

610
00:20:17,015 --> 00:20:19,383
AND THAT’S HOW SHE SPEAKS, WITH

611
00:20:19,383 --> 00:20:21,452
ME GIVING HER MORE BLOOD.

612
00:20:21,452 --> 00:20:22,820
SEE?

613
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,920
>> [whimpers]

614
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:27,823
>> SO WILL YOU TAKE MY LOVE?

615
00:20:27,823 --> 00:20:29,425
I REALLY DO WANT TO GIVE IT TO

616
00:20:29,425 --> 00:20:31,760
YOU.

>> [panting] HARUNA...

624
00:20:40,733 --> 00:20:43,702
PLEASE, YOU HAVE TO STOP THIS.

625
00:20:43,702 --> 00:20:45,403
STOP HURTING PEOPLE WITH THAT

626
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:46,504
KNIFE!

627
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:47,772

628
00:20:47,772 --> 00:20:49,473
ALIVE?

>> PLEASE STOP.

00:20:52,743 --> 00:20:54,944
>> FINE, WHATEVER.

631
00:20:54,944 --> 00:20:56,412
I’M GUESSING THAT SOMEONE CAME

632
00:20:56,412 --> 00:20:57,780
IN AND SAVED YOU AGAIN.

633
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,914
NOW, LISTEN, I REALLY DON’T LIKE

634
00:20:59,914 --> 00:21:01,449
YOU COMING HERE, AND TELLING ME

635
00:21:01,449 --> 00:21:03,284
WHAT I SHOULD DO.

636
00:21:03,284 --> 00:21:04,918
I DON’T NEED ADVICE FROM SOMEONE

637
00:21:04,918 --> 00:21:06,419
SO WEAK, THAT THEY LEECH OFF OF

638
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:07,420
OTHERS.

639
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,388
>> YOU HAVE IT WRONG.

640
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:09,422
I DIDN’T DO IT BECAUSE I WAS

641
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:11,423
WEAK, I HAD OTHER OPTIONS.

642
00:21:11,423 --> 00:21:13,492
I CHOSE THIS LIFE FOR A REASON,

643
00:21:13,492 --> 00:21:14,926
NOT BECAUSE I HAD TO.

644
00:21:14,926 --> 00:21:16,727
>> HUH, SAME THING.

645
00:21:16,727 --> 00:21:18,463
>> YOU CAN’T JUDGE PEOPLE BY HOW

646
00:21:18,463 --> 00:21:20,497
THEY LIVE AND JUST DECIDE IF

647
00:21:20,497 --> 00:21:21,698
THEY’RE WEAK OR STRONG.

648
00:21:21,698 --> 00:21:24,567
>> SO TELL ME SOMETHING--HAVE

649
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,968
YOU EVER ACTUALLY LOVED SOMEONE

650
00:21:25,968 --> 00:21:26,769
BEFORE?

651
00:21:26,769 --> 00:21:27,770
>> [cries]

652
00:21:27,770 --> 00:21:29,904
>> NO, I DON’T THINK YOU HAVE.

653
00:21:29,904 --> 00:21:31,939
SO IT GOES TO SAY, YOU CAN’T

654
00:21:31,939 --> 00:21:33,540
UNDERSTAND ME.

655
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,909
LISTEN CLOSE, I WAS ABLE TO TAKE

656
00:21:35,909 --> 00:21:37,677
OVER SAIKA WITH THE POWER OF MY

657
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:39,011
LOVE.

658
00:21:39,011 --> 00:21:40,613
THE FIRST TIME SAIKA TOLD ME TO

659
00:21:40,613 --> 00:21:41,881
CUT TAKASHI, I RESISTED WITH

660
00:21:41,881 --> 00:21:43,015
EVERYTHING I HAD.

661
00:21:43,015 --> 00:21:45,449
BUT THEN, AS I LISTENED TO HER

662
00:21:45,449 --> 00:21:48,619
VOICE, I UNDERSTOOD...

663
00:21:48,619 --> 00:21:50,587
AND THAT’S WHY SAIKA AND I HAVE

664
00:21:50,587 --> 00:21:51,621
BECOME THE MOTHER.

665
00:21:51,621 --> 00:21:53,590
WE’RE MAKING AS MANY CHILDREN AS

666
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:54,991
WE POSSIBLY CAN IN AN EFFORT

667
00:21:54,991 --> 00:21:56,558
TO SPREAD OUR LOVE.

668
00:21:56,558 --> 00:21:57,659
THAT’S RIGHT, LOVE!

669
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:58,960
SOMEDAY WE WILL LOVE AND

670
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:02,563
CONTROL THE ENTIRE HUMAN RACE!

IT’S LIKE YOU SAID.

678
00:22:14,572 --> 00:22:16,607
I CAN’T LOVE ANYONE.

679
00:22:16,607 --> 00:22:17,874
I’VE BEEN TOO SCARED...

680
00:22:17,874 --> 00:22:20,043
EVER SINCE THAT DAY FIVE YEARS

681
00:22:20,043 --> 00:22:21,744
AGO.

682
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:24,647
