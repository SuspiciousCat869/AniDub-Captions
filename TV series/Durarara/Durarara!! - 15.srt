THAT’S NOT POSSIBLE.

348

THERE’S NO WAY.

349
00:10:58,477 --> 00:10:59,946
CELTY MUST BE SOME KIND OF

350
00:10:59,946 --> 00:11:01,381
AN ILLUSIONIST.

351
00:11:01,381 --> 00:11:02,482
I PULLED MYSELF TOGETHER AND

352
00:11:02,482 --> 00:11:04,952
WENT BACK TO MY QUESTIONS.

353
00:11:04,952 --> 00:11:06,220
I HEARD ALL ABOUT THE DOLLARS

354
00:11:06,220 --> 00:11:07,922
AND THE YELLOW SCARVES.

355
00:11:07,922 --> 00:11:09,224
THERE’S RUMORS OUT THERE THAT

356
00:11:09,224 --> 00:11:10,125
THE DOLLARS DON’T SEEM TO

357
00:11:10,125 --> 00:11:10,826
ACKNOWLEDGE.

358
00:11:10,826 --> 00:11:12,094
SO BECAUSE OF THIS, THEY SAY

359
00:11:12,094 --> 00:11:13,363
THAT THE HEAD OF THE YELLOW

360
00:11:13,363 --> 00:11:15,098
SCARVES IS ABOUT TO MAKE A MOVE.

361
00:11:15,098 --> 00:11:16,432
>> SO WHO IS THIS HEAD GUY?

362
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:18,134
>> WE DON’T HAVE ANY IDEA.

363
00:11:18,134 --> 00:11:19,236
I DOUBT EVEN THE YOUNGER GUYS

364
00:11:19,236 --> 00:11:20,471
IN THE YELLOW SCARVES KNOW

365
00:11:20,471 --> 00:11:22,039
WHO HE IS.

366
00:11:22,039 --> 00:11:23,976
>> WHOEVER THIS HEAD GUY IS, HE

367
00:11:23,976 --> 00:11:25,310
GAVE THE YELLOW SCARVES STRICT

368
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:26,912
ORDERS TO DO ONE THING.

369
00:11:26,912 --> 00:11:30,049
STAY AWAY FROM IZAYA ORIHARA.

370
00:11:30,049 --> 00:11:31,351
I WONDER...

371
00:11:31,351 --> 00:11:37,192
COULD THIS BE THE TOUGHEST GUY?

372
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:38,359
ACCORDING TO THE YELLOW SCARVES,

373
00:11:38,359 --> 00:11:39,861
THE DOLLARS WERE THE ONES

A FEW DAYS AGO, THESE HIGH

377
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,268
SCHOOL GIRLS WERE ATTACKED BY

378
00:11:45,268 --> 00:11:47,137
THE SLASHER.

379
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:50,274
BUT ONE WALKED AWAY UNHARMED.

380
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:51,509
WHEN I HEARD THAT, IT MADE ME

381
00:11:51,509 --> 00:11:53,011
START THINKING ABOUT MY OWN

382
00:11:53,011 --> 00:11:55,114

383
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:56,381
THE KIND OF THINGS A FATHER

WOULD DO TO PROTECT HIS DAUGHTER

385
00:11:57,483 --> 00:12:00,153
FROM THE SLASHER.

386
00:12:00,153 --> 00:12:01,421
BUT RIGHT NOW MY DAUGHTER IS

387
00:12:01,421 --> 00:12:02,389
LIKE AN ALIEN I HAVE NO HOPE OF
