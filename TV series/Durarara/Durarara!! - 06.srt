682
00:22:32,025 --> 00:22:33,026
ALL THE MONEY YOU WANT.

683
00:22:33,026 --> 00:22:34,527
IT’S NO PROBLEM.

684
00:22:34,527 --> 00:22:36,563
>> THANKS A LOT, SIS.

685
00:22:36,563 --> 00:22:39,865
>> BYE, SEIJI.

686
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,868
>> LET’S GO.

687
00:22:49,171 --> 00:22:50,873
>> AND THAT’S THE LEGENDARY

688
00:22:50,873 --> 00:22:52,874
KAZUTANO INCIDENT.

689
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:54,875
FOR US, WE’RE JUST GLAD WE GOT

690
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:57,043
OUR FRIEND BACK SAFE AND SOUND.

691
00:22:57,043 --> 00:22:59,679
IT’S AS SIMPLE AS THAT.

692
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:02,681
>> ♪ [singing in Japanese] ♪

693
00:23:02,681 --> 00:23:10,720
♪ ♪

694
00:24:29,108 --> 00:24:31,076
>> NOISY, ANNOYING, AND PISSING

695
00:24:31,076 --> 00:24:31,896
ME OFF.

696
00:24:31,896 --> 00:24:33,696
WHEN MY ANGER BOILS OVER, MY

697
00:24:33,696 --> 00:24:35,596
BODY STARTS TO ACT ON ITS OWN.

698
00:24:35,596 --> 00:24:36,829
THERE’S NO REGARD FOR MY OWN

699
00:24:36,829 --> 00:24:38,129
WELL-BEING.

700
00:24:38,129 --> 00:24:40,462
NEXT TIME, BAD-ASS DUDE.

701
00:24:40,462 --> 00:24:43,562
BUT I ABSOLUTELY HATE VIOLENCE!
