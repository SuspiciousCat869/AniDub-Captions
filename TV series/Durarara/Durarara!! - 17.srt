00:13:37,061 --> 00:13:37,728
>> MAN, WHAT COULD BE SO

346
00:13:37,728 --> 00:13:39,463
IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW?

347
00:13:39,463 --> 00:13:40,329
>> I’M FINE.

348
00:13:40,329 --> 00:13:41,330
HE DIDN’T NEED TO STAY.

349
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,365
>> SO HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE

350
00:13:42,365 --> 00:13:43,231
POLICE YET?

351
00:13:43,231 --> 00:13:44,299
FROM WHAT I HEARD, THERE WERE A

352
00:13:44,299 --> 00:13:45,300
WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ENDED

353
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,434
UP GETTING HURT AND...

354
00:13:46,434 --> 00:13:47,534
>> NO, IT’S OKAY.

355
00:13:47,534 --> 00:13:49,202
>> IT’S NOT OKAY!

356
00:13:49,202 --> 00:13:50,403
>> I THINK THE ATTACKS ARE OVER

357
00:13:50,403 --> 00:13:52,104
NOW.

358
00:13:52,104 --> 00:13:53,639
I JUST HAVE THAT FEELING.

359
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,174
>> AND WHY’S THAT?

360
00:13:55,174 --> 00:13:55,774
>> [laughs]

361
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:57,708
OH, I SHOULDN’T LAUGH.

362
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,309
THE TRUTH IS, SEVERAL HOURS

363
00:13:59,309 --> 00:14:01,378
BEFORE I GOT HURT, I HAD

364
00:14:01,378 --> 00:14:02,245
ANOTHER RUN-IN WITH THE

365
00:14:02,245 --> 00:14:03,345
SLASHER TOO.

366
00:14:03,345 --> 00:14:05,247
IT’S KINDA CRAZY, BUT I WAS

367
00:14:05,247 --> 00:14:07,115
SAVED BY ALL THESE PEOPLE.

368
00:14:07,115 --> 00:14:08,283
AND SOME OF THEM WERE JUST SO

369
00:14:08,283 --> 00:14:09,484
SUPER COOL.

370
00:14:09,484 --> 00:14:11,318
>> SO...SO SUPER COOL?

371
00:14:11,318 --> 00:14:12,586
WHAT’S GOIN’ ON?

372
00:14:12,586 --> 00:14:14,020
>> THERE WAS THIS BARTENDER

373
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:15,621
GUY WITH SUNGLASSES...

374
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:16,722
>> WHAT?

375
00:14:16,722 --> 00:14:18,490
IS SHE TALKING ABOUT SHIZUO?

376
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:19,523
>> AND THERE WAS THIS OTHER

377
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:22,158
REALLY AWESOME PERSON.

378
00:14:22,158 --> 00:14:23,126
YOU WON’T BELIEVE IT WHEN I

379
00:14:23,126 --> 00:14:24,394
TELL YOU...

380
00:14:24,394 --> 00:14:27,296
I MET THE HEADLESS RIDER!

381
00:14:27,296 --> 00:14:30,431
>> WH--SO...

382
00:14:30,431 --> 00:14:31,432
WAIT A SECOND!

383
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,533
>> I GOT TO TALK TO IT FOR A FEW

384
00:14:32,533 --> 00:14:33,800
MINUTES.

385
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,267
IT WAS SO AMAZING.

386
00:14:35,267 --> 00:14:36,402
YOU COULD TELL IT REALLY CARED

387
00:14:36,402 --> 00:14:37,536
ABOUT PEOPLE.

388
00:14:37,536 --> 00:14:38,637
IT IS ODD.

389
00:14:38,637 --> 00:14:39,637
YOU PROBABLY DON’T BELIEVE ME,

390
00:14:39,637 --> 00:14:40,738
DO YOU?

391
00:14:40,738 --> 00:14:42,439
>> NO, I MEAN, IF YOU’RE SAYING

392
00:14:42,439 --> 00:14:43,140
IT’S TRUE...

393
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:44,474
BUT CELTY’S A WOMAN!

394
00:14:44,474 --> 00:14:45,408
>> AND THEN WHEN I WAS ATTACKED

395
00:14:45,408 --> 00:14:47,276
A SECOND TIME, THE HEADLESS

396
00:14:47,276 --> 00:14:48,376
RIDER APPEARED OUT OF NOWHERE

397
00:14:48,376 --> 00:14:50,412
AND SAVED ME AGAIN.

398
00:14:50,412 --> 00:14:51,446
I GUESS THAT’S WHY I FEEL LIKE

399
00:14:51,446 --> 00:14:52,814
I’LL BE OKAY.

400
00:14:52,814 --> 00:14:53,780
>> YEAH, BUT THE HEADLESS RIDER

401
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,448
IS...

402
00:14:54,448 --> 00:14:55,749
>> HUH?

403
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:57,317
>> I CAN’T TELL HER, BECAUSE

404
00:14:57,317 --> 00:14:59,451
IF I DO...

405
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:01,420
WELL, YOU SEE, IT’S JUST THAT

406
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:03,187
THOSE PEOPLE, THE WORLD THOSE

407
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:04,388
GUYS LIVE IN IS JUST SO

408
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:06,423
ENTIRELY DIFFERENT FROM OURS...

409
00:15:06,423 --> 00:15:07,357
YOU MIGHT WANT TO KEEP YOUR

410
00:15:07,357 --> 00:15:08,590
DISTANCE FROM THEM.

411
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,326
>> TELL ME, MIKADO, WHAT DO

412
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,560
YOU THINK A TRULY UNUSUAL LIFE

413
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:12,727
WOULD BE LIKE?

414
00:15:12,727 --> 00:15:14,294
SOMETHING REALLY UNIQUE.

415
00:15:14,294 --> 00:15:14,736
>> HUH?

416
00:15:14,736 --> 00:15:15,629
>> IT’D BE THE KIND OF LIFE

417
00:15:15,629 --> 00:15:17,297
WHERE, EVERY SINGLE DAY,

418
00:15:17,297 --> 00:15:19,365
NOTHING NEW EVER HAPPENED.

419
00:15:19,365 --> 00:15:20,833
NOTHING CHANGED.

420
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:23,468
THAT KIND OF A LIFE IS TRULY

421
00:15:23,468 --> 00:15:29,405
UNUSUAL.

422
00:15:29,405 --> 00:15:30,506
>> I’LL HAVE A DOCTOR I KNOW

423
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:31,340
TAKE A LOOK AT HER.

424
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:34,508
DON’T WORRY.

425
00:15:34,508 --> 00:15:37,410
>> CELTY, I--LISTEN, I REALLY...

426
00:15:37,410 --> 00:15:39,112
>> DON’T APOLOGIZE.

427
00:15:39,112 --> 00:15:40,279
YOU DID WHAT YOU THOUGHT WAS

428
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,480
BEST, DIDN’T YOU?

429
00:15:41,480 --> 00:15:42,448
AND IF IT MAKES YOU FEEL

430
00:15:42,448 --> 00:15:43,749
BETTER, I THINK IT WAS RIGHT

431
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:44,615
TOO.

432
00:15:44,615 --> 00:15:46,417
I DO THINK KNOCKING MY HEAD OFF

433
00:15:46,417 --> 00:15:48,185
TOOK THINGS A BIT TOO FAR, BUT

434
00:15:48,185 --> 00:15:51,554
I’LL TAKE THAT UP WITH SAIKA.

435
00:15:51,554 --> 00:15:52,721
I’M NOT ENDORSING EVERYTHING

436
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:55,723
YOU DID.

437
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:57,324
I JUST THINK IF WE WERE TO

438
00:15:57,324 --> 00:15:59,626
FIGHT, YOU’D WIN.

439
00:16:05,230 --> 00:16:06,164
IF YOU STILL HAVE YOUR DOUBTS,

440
00:16:06,164 --> 00:16:07,331
THEN I SUGGEST YOU STOP

441
00:16:07,331 --> 00:16:08,699
QUESTIONING YOURSELF AND

442
00:16:08,699 --> 00:16:10,433
INSTEAD USE THAT POWER YOU HAVE

443
00:16:10,433 --> 00:16:13,836
TO BETTER THIS TOWN.

444
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:15,604
>> SHE HAD OBTAINED A POWER.

445
00:16:15,604 --> 00:16:17,105
A POWER THAT ALLOWED HER TO

446
00:16:17,105 --> 00:16:18,606
CONTROL A HUNDRED SAIKAS AND

447
00:16:18,606 --> 00:16:21,508
BEND THEM TO HER WILL.

448
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:22,509
IT WAS NO SMALL BURDEN FOR

449
00:16:22,509 --> 00:16:23,609
HER TO BEAR.

450
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:25,211
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, IT

451
00:16:25,211 --> 00:16:26,378
WAS A LOAD SHE WAS GLAD TO

452
00:16:26,378 --> 00:16:28,646
CARRY.

453
00:16:28,646 --> 00:16:30,181
SHE’D ALWAYS FELT SOMEWHAT

454
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:31,448
ADRIFT BEFORE.

455
00:16:31,448 --> 00:16:32,649
BUT NOW, WITH THE FATE OF

456
00:16:32,649 --> 00:16:34,184
OTHERS WEIGHING IN HER HANDS,

457
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:36,385
SHE FINALLY FELT GROUNDED IN

458
00:16:36,385 --> 00:16:37,586
REALITY.

459
00:16:37,586 --> 00:16:39,387
[buzzing sound]

460
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,421
>> [gasps]

461
00:16:40,421 --> 00:16:41,722
>> JUST THEN, SHE HEARD A

462
00:16:41,722 --> 00:16:43,356
VOICE.

463
00:16:43,356 --> 00:16:44,757
IT SAID, "I MAY NOT LOVE YOU,

464
00:16:44,757 --> 00:16:46,525
BUT I DON’T HATE YOU."

465
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:47,559
PERHAPS IT WAS JUST HER

466
00:16:47,559 --> 00:16:49,527
IMAGINATION.

467
00:16:49,527 --> 00:16:50,528
SO SHE CALLED OUT TO THE

468
00:16:50,528 --> 00:16:52,663
VOICE, BUT NO ONE ANSWERED.

469
00:16:52,663 --> 00:16:54,664
WHICH, IN THE END, WAS FINE BY

470
00:16:54,664 --> 00:16:56,165
HER.

471
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:56,765
ACTUALLY, IT MADE HER A

472
00:16:56,765 --> 00:17:01,336
LITTLE HAPPY.

473
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:06,306
>> [gasps]

474
00:17:06,306 --> 00:17:07,740
>> IT SEEMED THAT FINALLY HER

475
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:13,177
LIFE HAD GONE BACK TO NORMAL.

476
00:17:13,177 --> 00:17:14,578
HOWEVER, SHE COULDN’T TELL

477
00:17:14,578 --> 00:17:16,146
THEM THE TRUTH.

478
00:17:16,146 --> 00:17:17,447
NOT ABOUT SAIKA OR THE

479
00:17:17,447 --> 00:17:20,616
PERSON PULLING THE STRINGS.

480
00:17:20,616 --> 00:17:21,783
WHEN SHE TOOK CONTROL OF

481
00:17:21,783 --> 00:17:23,384
ALL THE SAIKAS, SHE ABSORBED

482
00:17:23,384 --> 00:17:24,685
THE MEMORIES HARUNA NIEKAWA

483
00:17:24,685 --> 00:17:26,686
HAD WITH THOSE BLADES.

484
00:17:26,686 --> 00:17:27,787
THAT’S HOW SHE DISCOVERED WHO

485
00:17:27,787 --> 00:17:30,423
WAS BEHIND THIS.

486
00:17:30,423 --> 00:17:31,557
SHE DIDN’T KNOW WHAT HE WAS

487
00:17:31,557 --> 00:17:32,590
AFTER.

488
00:17:32,590 --> 00:17:33,425
BUT IF THAT PERSON HURT

489
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:35,559
MIKADO OR MASAOMI OR DISTURBED

490
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:37,394
THEIR PEACE, SHE KNEW SHE’D

491
00:17:37,394 --> 00:17:39,362
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

492
00:17:39,362 --> 00:17:40,596
RELIVING IT AGAIN WAS

493
00:17:40,596 --> 00:17:42,231
HORRIBLE, BUT SHE WAS

494
00:17:42,231 --> 00:17:43,298
DETERMINED TO REMEMBER HIS

495
00:17:43,298 --> 00:17:44,866
NAME.

496
00:17:44,866 --> 00:17:47,367
THEN IT CAME TO HER.

497
00:17:47,367 --> 00:17:49,536
>> IZAYA ORIHARA IS STRANGE.

498
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:50,603
I CAN’T BELIEVE YOUR PARENTS

499
00:17:50,603 --> 00:17:51,804
NAMED YOU THAT.

500
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,439
>> IT MAY BE A COINCIDENCE THAT

501
00:17:53,439 --> 00:17:54,439
I’VE TURNED OUT THE WAY THAT I

502
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:55,473
HAVE.

503
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:56,741
BUT THE NAME DOES FIT ME

504
00:17:56,741 --> 00:17:58,342
PERFECTLY.

505
00:17:58,342 --> 00:17:59,443
DO YOU BELIEVE IN COINCIDENCE,

506
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:01,310
NAMIE?

507
00:18:01,310 --> 00:18:03,178
>> WHY DO YOU ASK?

508
00:18:03,178 --> 00:18:04,512
>> I THINK MOST PEOPLE WILL

509
00:18:04,512 --> 00:18:05,513
ATTRIBUTE THESE RECENT EVENTS

510
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:06,614
TO NOTHING MORE THAN

511
00:18:06,614 --> 00:18:08,249
COINCIDENCE.

512
00:18:08,249 --> 00:18:10,450
BUT YOU SEE, I SENT NASUJIMA TO

513
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,584
THE GIRL’S HOUSE AT THAT HOUR

514
00:18:11,584 --> 00:18:13,586
OF THE NIGHT.

515
00:18:13,586 --> 00:18:15,254
THAT POOR SUCKER WAS TRULY AN

516
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:16,588
IDIOT.

517
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:17,455
HE COULD HAVE FOUND

518
00:18:17,455 --> 00:18:19,190
ANRI SONOHARA’S ADDRESS JUST BY

519
00:18:19,190 --> 00:18:21,358
PEEKING AT HIS CLASS ROSTER.

520
00:18:21,358 --> 00:18:23,459
YOU SEE, ONCE YOU ACCEPT THEY

521
00:18:23,459 --> 00:18:25,394
EXIST, THE HARD PART IS OVER.

522
00:18:25,394 --> 00:18:26,762
THEY’RE SUDDENLY EVERYWHERE.

523
00:18:26,762 --> 00:18:28,363
DEMONIC BLADES, FAERIES,

524
00:18:28,363 --> 00:18:29,264
THERE’S NO END.

525
00:18:29,264 --> 00:18:29,797
>> HMM?

526
00:18:29,797 --> 00:18:31,565
>> ACTUALLY, THE ONLY REAL

527
00:18:31,565 --> 00:18:33,466
COINCIDENCE, WAS WHEN

528
00:18:33,466 --> 00:18:36,434
NASUJIMA RAN OFF WITH MY CASH.

529
00:18:36,434 --> 00:18:37,635
HE OWED SOME SERIOUS DEBTS.

530
00:18:37,635 --> 00:18:39,203
SO HE TRIED TO GET THE CASH BY

531
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,204
THREATENING THE PARENTS OF

532
00:18:40,204 --> 00:18:41,938
HARUNA NIEKAWA, THE GIRL WHO’D

533
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,674
BEEN STALKING HIM AT SCHOOL.

534
00:18:44,674 --> 00:18:45,908
THE LOAN SHARKS HE OWED MONEY

535
00:18:45,908 --> 00:18:47,442
TO WERE THE AWAKUSU.

536
00:18:47,442 --> 00:18:48,677
SO THEY SENT HIM TO ME SO I

537
00:18:48,677 --> 00:18:49,844
COULD DIG UP A LITTLE DIRT ON

538
00:18:49,844 --> 00:18:51,212
THE GIRL’S FAMILY.

539
00:18:51,212 --> 00:18:52,846
OH! HI, THERE.

540
00:18:58,650 --> 00:18:59,718
HE TOOK THE BAIT, HOOK, LINE,

541
00:18:59,718 --> 00:19:01,586
AND SINKER.

542
00:19:01,586 --> 00:19:03,553
I KNEW HARUNA WAS SAIKA, OR AT

543
00:19:03,553 --> 00:19:05,589
LEAST A VARIATION.

544
00:19:05,589 --> 00:19:07,223
I HAD PLANNED TO CORNER HIM AND

545
00:19:07,223 --> 00:19:08,657
SAY SOMETHING LIKE, "HOW DARE

546
00:19:08,657 --> 00:19:09,992
YOU STEAL MY MONEY?"

547
00:19:09,992 --> 00:19:11,593
THEN I WAS GOING TO THREATEN HIM

548
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:14,595
AND USE HARUNA, BUT THAT’S WHEN

549
00:19:14,595 --> 00:19:15,929
THE REAL SAIKA, THE ORIGINAL,

550
00:19:15,929 --> 00:19:18,498
CAME ONTO THE SCENE.

551
00:19:18,498 --> 00:19:20,332
SO THEN, WHAT BECAME OF

552
00:19:20,332 --> 00:19:20,865
NASUJIMA?

553
00:19:27,570 --> 00:19:31,573
>> STOP! GIVE ME YOUR MONEY!

554
00:19:31,573 --> 00:19:33,508
>> HUH?

555
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:34,975
>> [howls]

556
00:19:34,975 --> 00:19:35,976

557
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,544
WOULD’VE BEEN FOR SHIZU-CHAN TO

558
00:19:37,544 --> 00:19:39,345
HAVE DIED THAT NIGHT.

559
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:41,514
BUT WHATEVER.

560
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:42,915
EVERYTHING STILL WORKED OUT THE

561
00:19:42,915 --> 00:19:44,816
WAY I WANTED THEM TO.

562
00:19:44,816 --> 00:19:46,417
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

563
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:47,284

564

>> SO MANY COPS.

566
00:19:49,585 --> 00:19:52,988
WHAT’S UP WITH ALL THAT?

567

IN SOUTH IKEBUKURO PARK TOO.

KIND OF TURF FIGHT.

573
00:20:00,627 --> 00:20:02,528

574
00:20:02,528 --> 00:20:03,795
>> WHAT CAUSED ALL THAT, ANYWAY?

575
00:20:03,795 --> 00:20:05,296

00:20:10,534 --> 00:20:16,271
IT’S LIKE HE’D BEEN HYPNOTIZED.

580
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:17,038
>> THE COPS STILL THINK IT WAS

581
00:20:17,038 --> 00:20:18,405
JUST ANOTHER FIGHT BETWEEN THE

582
00:20:18,405 --> 00:20:19,673
COLOR GANGS.

DOWN INTO THREE FACTIONS--THE

595
00:20:51,362 --> 00:20:52,729
DOLLARS, THE YELLOW SCARVES, AND

596
00:20:52,729 --> 00:20:54,897
THE ARMY OF THAT DEMONIC BLADE.

597

BRINGING SPIES TO BOTH CAMPS.

600
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:02,370
TO BE HONEST, I’D HAVE BEEN

601
00:21:02,370 --> 00:21:03,971
FINE WITH HARUNA NIEKAWA, JUST

602
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:05,738
SO LONG AS THAT ARMY OF THE

603
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:07,706
DAMNED CAME WITH HER.

604
00:21:07,706 --> 00:21:09,608
BUT THAT ANRI SONOHARA IS MORE

605
00:21:09,608 --> 00:21:10,675
INTERESTING.

606
00:21:10,675 --> 00:21:11,742

AND THAT’S FINE, ’CAUSE FROM

00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,713
HERE THINGS WILL BEGIN TO

OWN.

613
00:21:19,715 --> 00:21:21,716
THE SUSPENSE IS KILLING ME!

614
00:21:21,716 --> 00:21:23,317

615
00:21:23,317 --> 00:21:24,785
WERE STARTED BY A MIDDLE SCHOOL

616
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:26,619
BRAT, WEREN’T THEY?

617
00:21:26,619 --> 00:21:28,688
HOW TOUGH CAN THEY REALLY BE?

618
00:21:28,688 --> 00:21:29,889
>> THE FACT THAT A KID LIKE HIM

619
00:21:29,889 --> 00:21:31,356
CAN PUT TOGETHER A POSSE OF

HE’S A SERIOUS THREAT.

622

00:21:37,927 --> 00:21:40,396
YELLOW SCARVES IS SORT OF AN

624

JUST YOUR AVERAGE HIGH-SCHOOLER.

00:22:09,549 --> 00:22:10,983
ALL THAT I WANTED.

642
00:22:10,983 --> 00:22:12,551

PEACE TO IT.

644
00:22:13,652 --> 00:22:14,653
THE PEOPLE I’M TIGHT WITH WERE

CLOSE TO ME, AND THINGS ONLY GOT

649
00:22:22,625 --> 00:22:24,527
ANRI, THEY’RE GONNA HAVE TO

650

CRUSH ’EM.

654

ARE MIXED UP IN ANY OF THIS,
