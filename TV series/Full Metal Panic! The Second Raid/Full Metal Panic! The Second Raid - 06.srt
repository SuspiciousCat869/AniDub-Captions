1
00:02:02,983 --> 00:02:04,275
Ancient Greece.

2
00:02:04,358 --> 00:02:06,358
Mediterranean Sea.

3
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,733
Wei, Wu, Shu.

4
00:02:08,817 --> 00:02:12,192
Jin dynasty unified the Northern
and Southern dynasties.

5
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:18,692
I swear he's
gonna get held back!

6
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:21,108
I'm sorry...

7
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:22,108
I'm late...

8
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,567
Oh, Sagara!

9
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,275
So you finally decided to
grace us with your presence.

10
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:27,567
That nonchalant attitude

11
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:29,108
is gonna get you in
a heap of trouble, mister!

12
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:30,358
Yes, sir!

13
00:02:30,442 --> 00:02:31,983
Unfortunately,
circumstances kept me from...

14
00:02:32,067 --> 00:02:33,025
Uh--huh, that's enough!

15
00:02:33,108 --> 00:02:34,233
Just take your seat
and get started!

16
00:02:34,317 --> 00:02:35,692
Right away, sir.

17
00:02:48,608 --> 00:02:50,358
Vincent Bruno.

18
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,817
At the Cross--Yangtze
River Tunnel operation,

19
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:55,692
you were charged with
communications security,

20
00:02:55,775 --> 00:02:57,442
but you decided to
feed that information

21
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:59,317
to another organization.

22
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:02,275
Am I correct?

23
00:03:02,358 --> 00:03:03,483
Answer him!

24
00:03:05,192 --> 00:03:06,275
You know?

25
00:03:06,358 --> 00:03:07,942
The last couple of days
are kinda blurry.

26
00:03:08,025 --> 00:03:08,692
Do it.

27
00:03:08,775 --> 00:03:09,817
Yes, sir!

28
00:03:18,817 --> 00:03:19,525
Don't worry.

29
00:03:19,608 --> 00:03:21,483
This will be over soon.

30
00:03:21,567 --> 00:03:24,483
If you ask me, breaking
his fingers isn't enough.

31
00:03:24,567 --> 00:03:25,275
Oh GOD!

32
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:26,775
Please don't do any more!

33
00:03:26,858 --> 00:03:29,400
Okay, okay, I understand,
I'll tell you anything you want!

34
00:03:29,483 --> 00:03:30,775
Just don't do any more!

35
00:03:30,858 --> 00:03:31,567
Fine!

36
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,067
Then you WERE responsible

37
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,692
for compromising our security
on that operation? Right?

38
00:03:35,775 --> 00:03:37,650
Yeah! Yeah!
That was me! I did it, OK?!

39
00:03:37,733 --> 00:03:38,775
And who hired you?

40
00:03:38,858 --> 00:03:39,650
I don't know!

41
00:03:39,733 --> 00:03:40,608
Stop lying!

42
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:41,983
No, it's the truth, dammit!

43
00:03:42,067 --> 00:03:44,567
I swear to God they
wouldn't tell me their names!

44
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:46,108
All they said is that
they were from...

45
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:46,817
umm...

46
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,275
Amalgam, yeah, Amalgam!

47
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:50,525
Amalgam?

48
00:03:50,608 --> 00:03:51,692
They didn't let me
in on any more than THAT.

49
00:03:51,775 --> 00:03:53,025
It's the truth!

50
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:55,108
I thought maybe those
jokers were from the KGB,

51
00:03:55,192 --> 00:03:56,358
the GRU or something.

52
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,733
I-- I, just didn't
take it too seriously!

53
00:03:58,817 --> 00:04:01,442
But then they paid me
200,000 dollars in advance...

54
00:04:01,525 --> 00:04:03,817
An easy 200, 000
right up front!

55
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:05,483
I just couldn't refuse it!

56
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,150
I'm sorry!

57
00:04:06,233 --> 00:04:07,483
We've seen enough.

58
00:04:07,567 --> 00:04:09,025
A mercury alloy...

59
00:04:09,108 --> 00:04:11,483
Interesting choice,
wouldn't you say so?

60
00:04:11,567 --> 00:04:14,108
Does the name "Amalgam"
mean anything to you?

61
00:04:14,192 --> 00:04:15,650
A threat that
their caustic properties

62
00:04:15,733 --> 00:04:18,108
could destroy even
fictional metals?

63
00:04:18,192 --> 00:04:19,275
Like Mithril.

64
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,983
But still...

65
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,608
...was all of that necessary?

66
00:04:22,692 --> 00:04:24,025
The interrogation?

67
00:04:24,108 --> 00:04:26,108
It's definitely
unpleasant and painful,

68
00:04:26,192 --> 00:04:27,817
but they weren't
going to kill him.

69
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:30,067
Yes, it IS unpleasant.

70
00:04:31,233 --> 00:04:34,483
Besides, if it were me, I would
have cut his fingers off.

71
00:04:35,608 --> 00:04:37,567
The admiral's taking
a phone call at the moment,

72
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:40,150
but you're still welcome
to go inside, Captain.

73
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,858
Mister Jackson, you don't have
to call me "Captain" here.

74
00:04:42,942 --> 00:04:44,400
With all the brass around here,

75
00:04:44,483 --> 00:04:47,858
I'm sure not going to call you
"young lady" like I used to.

76
00:04:47,942 --> 00:04:49,025
Yeah, I know.

77
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:50,567
It's our mess and
we're gonna clean it up.

78
00:04:51,775 --> 00:04:52,942
Well, of course!

79
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,775
We're keeping a record
of the interrogation.

80
00:04:55,858 --> 00:04:57,233
What's that?

81
00:04:57,317 --> 00:04:58,858
Yeah, well, we'll have to
talk about that issue again

82
00:04:58,942 --> 00:05:02,025
some other time because I have
a meeting that just walked in.

83
00:05:04,483 --> 00:05:06,442
Now then, can I offer
the two of you a drink?

84
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:07,317
Thank you.

85
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,692
A bottled water will be fine.

86
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:09,442
And you?

87
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:10,650
The same, please.

88
00:05:10,733 --> 00:05:13,150
Come on now,
you're gettin' soft on me.

89
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:17,733
That call was from
my friend, General Amit.

90
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,067
Does Intelligence want us
to hand over Bruno, sir?

91
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:23,358
I refused, of course.

92
00:05:23,442 --> 00:05:25,442
But it seems like they're
bent out of shape that we went

93
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,108
and got him without
their say--so.

94
00:05:28,192 --> 00:05:31,567
By the way, did you come
to see the interrogation?

95
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:33,108
Yes.

96
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:36,025
Being Mithril's fleet
captain isn't an easy task.

97
00:05:36,108 --> 00:05:38,983
You need to see the uglier side
of how our business gets done

98
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,025
and learn something from it.

99
00:05:41,108 --> 00:05:43,233
That's just the
kind of path you're on.

100
00:05:46,525 --> 00:05:48,233
Don't let it get you down.

101
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:49,983
You'll understand.

102
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,192
We're taking his
statement right now.

103
00:05:52,275 --> 00:05:53,275
Who is it?

104
00:05:53,358 --> 00:05:56,108
"Amalgam." Another
independent group.

105
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,442
Did you say Amalgam?

106
00:05:57,525 --> 00:05:59,233
Have you heard of it before?

107
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:01,275
No, but it makes sense...

108
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:04,275
Some sort of shadow organization
that's flown under our radar

109
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:07,067
ends up being behind
the Perio Islands incident.

110
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:08,567
And then, months later,

111
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:11,650
rears its ugly head
to pester us in Nanking.

112
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:12,817
We're probably going to have to

113
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,192
re--think how we do
things around here.

114
00:06:16,692 --> 00:06:18,775
Sir, what exactly do you mean?

115
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,733
First off, Kaname Chidori.

116
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,275
The girl Intelligence
mentioned the other day.

117
00:06:25,525 --> 00:06:27,525
We just can't do it anymore.

118
00:06:27,608 --> 00:06:30,192
The "Whispered" incident has
demonstrated to us quite clearly

119
00:06:30,275 --> 00:06:33,817
that she's well beyond the
"matter of concern" stage.

120
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,942
And that's the
problem with Wraith.

121
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:38,192
It comes down to the fact

122
00:06:38,275 --> 00:06:40,817
that we're not using
our resources correctly.

123
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:42,983
I couldn't agree
with you more, but...

124
00:06:43,067 --> 00:06:44,567
But what?

125
00:06:44,650 --> 00:06:46,525
Well, Sergeant Sagara, sir...

126
00:06:46,608 --> 00:06:48,025
I think Sagara's talents

127
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:51,567
would be better served looking
after the ARX--7, Captain.

128
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,025
And right now is the time
to make it happen.

129
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,775
Do you have any objections?

130
00:06:59,358 --> 00:07:01,025
No, I agree.

131
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:05,358
Did you apologize
to Ms. Kagurazaka?

132
00:07:05,442 --> 00:07:06,525
Yes.

133
00:07:06,608 --> 00:07:08,817
I promised I would
reassemble her car.

134
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:11,233
Ya know -- even if
you pass, you might end up

135
00:07:11,317 --> 00:07:13,942
getting expelled for pulling
stunts like that, Sousuke!

136
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:14,567
Understood.

137
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,275
Understood?

138
00:07:15,358 --> 00:07:16,608
I don't think so!!!

139
00:07:16,692 --> 00:07:18,317
So where did you have
to go when the rest of us

140
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,150
were in the middle of taking
our mid--terms, Sousuke?

141
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,817
Something work--related.

142
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:26,275
It sounded like
a pretty rough deal.

143
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,275
Did everything go
all right out there?

144
00:07:28,358 --> 00:07:29,442
Not a problem.

145
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:31,608
Okay, then...

146
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:40,858
By the way...

147
00:07:40,942 --> 00:07:44,400
it looks like someone hasn't
had a haircut in a while.

148
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:46,858
I'd say she's RIGHT
about that one.

149
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:47,900
Is it strange?

150
00:07:47,983 --> 00:07:50,025
No, it's not really
too strange...

151
00:07:50,108 --> 00:07:51,400
But don't you normally

152
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:53,400
take yourself to a hair
salon to get your hair cut?

153
00:07:53,483 --> 00:07:54,608
What is a hair salon?

154
00:07:54,692 --> 00:07:56,067
A barber.

155
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:58,317
No, I always cut my hair myself.

156
00:08:00,108 --> 00:08:02,275
That explains a lot, actually.

157
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:04,317
Wait a minute, I just
thought of something!

158
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,983
Why don't we take Sousuke over
to one of those super--fancy,

159
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:08,858
metro--licious beauty shops?

160
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:11,067
And we can get him a
complete makeover, Kaname!

161
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:12,233
A beauty shop?!

162
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,942
Why don't we just
take him to a barber?

163
00:08:14,025 --> 00:08:16,650
Well, if Sousuke were a little
more fashion--conscious like the

164
00:08:16,733 --> 00:08:20,067
rest of us, he might look pretty
handsome, don't you think?

165
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:20,858
Uhhh...

166
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,525
I'm not so sure...

167
00:08:22,608 --> 00:08:24,567
You have to get him to agree
to it first, you know!

168
00:08:24,650 --> 00:08:26,775
Right, then let's try it.

169
00:08:26,858 --> 00:08:28,733
You just said that's where
normal high school students

170
00:08:28,817 --> 00:08:30,608
get their hair cut, didn't you?

171
00:08:32,067 --> 00:08:34,108
Well, looks like
somebody needs a makeover.

172
00:08:34,192 --> 00:08:35,775
Haircut, please.

173
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,150
Follow me this way.

174
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:41,900
Gosh, it's strange seeing
Sousuke actually take the time

175
00:08:41,983 --> 00:08:44,483
to do something about
his appearance, isn't it?

176
00:08:49,858 --> 00:08:52,358
I'm trying to talk to you
about your life and your FUTURE!

177
00:08:52,442 --> 00:08:53,983
You're only seventeen!

178
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:55,650
Haven't you even given
a little bit of thought

179
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,483
to the rest of your life?

180
00:08:58,983 --> 00:09:00,650
All right, let's lather you up!

181
00:09:08,025 --> 00:09:10,317
W--Wait!

182
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:11,358
Never mind.

183
00:09:11,442 --> 00:09:12,775
Go ahead...

184
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:14,317
Kaname!

185
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,317
Look!

186
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,650
I found an article
on Daikitsuba!

187
00:09:16,733 --> 00:09:18,358
Wow, well look at that...

188
00:09:18,442 --> 00:09:20,192
You all comfy--cozy, sweetie?

189
00:09:20,275 --> 00:09:21,400
No I'm not.

190
00:09:22,775 --> 00:09:25,983
I'm completely vulnerable.

191
00:09:26,067 --> 00:09:27,442
No, it's not a problem.

192
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,317
The soap isn't poisoned.

193
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,858
He's an ordinary civilian.

194
00:09:31,858 --> 00:09:34,483
Well, ordinary for THIS
profession, anyway.

195
00:09:34,567 --> 00:09:36,150
I'll remain calm...

196
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:37,442
Okay, it's just a towel.

197
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:37,817
Towel.

198
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:38,358
Towel.

199
00:09:38,442 --> 00:09:38,900
Regular towel.

200
00:09:38,983 --> 00:09:39,442
Calm down.

201
00:09:39,525 --> 00:09:40,442
Just a towel.

202
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:41,317
I'm not gonna be
strangled with it.

203
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,442
Just a towel.

204
00:09:42,525 --> 00:09:44,192
Okay, now let's make
some magic, honey!

205
00:09:44,275 --> 00:09:46,067
He tied this cloth around me
to keep the hair clippings

206
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:47,442
off my clothes,

207
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:49,483
NOT as a tactic to restrict
my freedom of movement.

208
00:09:49,567 --> 00:09:51,400
That's all there is to it,
nothing more.

209
00:09:51,483 --> 00:09:54,150
And I'm sure these are just
ordinary, everyday scisso...

210
00:09:56,233 --> 00:09:57,358
Don't even twitch!

211
00:09:58,733 --> 00:09:59,358
Jesus!

212
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:00,817
You're manhandling me!

213
00:10:04,775 --> 00:10:06,067
I did it again...

214
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,775
SOUSUKE!

215
00:10:23,150 --> 00:10:24,483
Don't worry,

216
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:27,150
getting him back on the
Arbalest will be good for him.

217
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:29,233
It's all my fault.

218
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:36,525
You asked me to take you
in the first place

219
00:10:36,608 --> 00:10:39,067
so why did you flip out
like that, Sousuke?

220
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,400
I'm sorry.

221
00:10:40,483 --> 00:10:42,483
They kicked us out of
the beauty parlor...

222
00:10:42,567 --> 00:10:45,317
and they even treated ME
like I was a crazy delinquent!

223
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,858
I understand, Kaname, but it's
too dangerous for me to let

224
00:10:47,942 --> 00:10:50,317
my guard down in front of
someone holding a blade.

225
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,692
Oh, well fine!

226
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:53,733
Then don't go to the beauty
shop in the first place!

227
00:10:53,817 --> 00:10:55,442
You use a knife on your own
hair but you didn't think

228
00:10:55,525 --> 00:10:57,525
you'd freak out when someone
else was cutting it?

229
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:59,525
One wrong move and you
easily could have KILLED

230
00:10:59,608 --> 00:11:01,900
a completely innocent
hairdresser!

231
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,275
COME ON!

232
00:11:03,358 --> 00:11:04,900
Why don't you stop thinking
everyone's an "assassin"

233
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:06,692
or an "enemy" once in a while?!

234
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,775
I can't do that because
Mithril's enemies are still

235
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,358
out there in force.

236
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:13,192
It wouldn't surprise me if
they attacked you at any time.

237
00:11:13,275 --> 00:11:14,400
They'd attack me?

238
00:11:14,483 --> 00:11:16,775
And that's why
you're my top priority.

239
00:11:16,858 --> 00:11:19,192
I'll always be here
to protect you.

240
00:11:21,942 --> 00:11:24,067
However...

241
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,150
I've been here six months...

242
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:29,817
and even still my
instincts often fail me.

243
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,150
In all this time,

244
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,275
I really don't think
I've adapted to this place.

245
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:35,442
All I do is cause
a lot of trouble.

246
00:11:36,817 --> 00:11:39,358
For you, and everyone else.

247
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,192
So...

248
00:11:45,275 --> 00:11:47,067
it's been 6 months, has it?

249
00:11:52,692 --> 00:11:55,733
Well, Sousuke, you haven't
made any progress at all,

250
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,150
that's for sure.

251
00:11:58,400 --> 00:11:59,442
Is that true?

252
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:01,900
Yeah, it is!

253
00:12:08,692 --> 00:12:10,192
Hey, Sousuke...

254
00:12:10,275 --> 00:12:12,192
Why don't you just
come over to my place?

255
00:12:12,275 --> 00:12:14,858
I bet I can take care of that
crazy "bird's nest" of yours

256
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:17,775
in no time flat!

257
00:12:17,858 --> 00:12:18,733
How 'bout it?

258
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,150
I don't know...

259
00:12:20,233 --> 00:12:22,275
You're not afraid
of me, are you?

260
00:12:23,442 --> 00:12:24,275
No, not at all.

261
00:12:24,358 --> 00:12:25,733
You're in no way
a threat to me.

262
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,733
All righty, sir!

263
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:37,233
How are we getting it
cut today?

264
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:40,400
Is this too tight?

265
00:12:40,483 --> 00:12:42,025
No, not a problem.

266
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,358
All right, let's do this!

267
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:51,858
Kaname?

268
00:12:51,942 --> 00:12:53,025
What?

269
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:54,400
Do you have any experience
giving haircuts?

270
00:12:54,483 --> 00:12:55,650
Of course I don't!

271
00:12:58,858 --> 00:13:01,150
Well, I've played around
with Kyoko's hair,

272
00:13:01,233 --> 00:13:03,775
but this'll be my first
time actually cutting.

273
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,108
Relax...

274
00:13:06,192 --> 00:13:09,233
This has to be better
than cutting it yourself.

275
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:11,317
Please be sure not
to cut off my ears.

276
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,192
I'll see what I can do...

277
00:13:26,525 --> 00:13:27,775
So, Sousuke...

278
00:13:27,858 --> 00:13:29,442
What is it?

279
00:13:29,525 --> 00:13:31,858
You kept on missing the
mid-terms because of your work,

280
00:13:31,942 --> 00:13:33,317
right?

281
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,650
Yes.

282
00:13:34,733 --> 00:13:37,067
And did you wind up
in combat again?

283
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:37,942
Is...

284
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,192
that a problem?

285
00:13:39,275 --> 00:13:40,983
Not really.

286
00:13:41,067 --> 00:13:43,233
You didn't get hurt
out there, did you?

287
00:13:43,317 --> 00:13:44,483
Just some minor injuries.

288
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:46,067
They should heal quickly.

289
00:13:47,608 --> 00:13:48,900
Oh...

290
00:14:26,025 --> 00:14:27,733
So, Mr. Sousuke,

291
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:30,400
anyone seem a little
"on edge" to you lately?

292
00:14:30,483 --> 00:14:31,358
Who would that be?

293
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:32,692
I meant YOU.

294
00:14:32,775 --> 00:14:33,650
Who, me?

295
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:34,733
Yes, you.

296
00:14:34,817 --> 00:14:36,067
You were doing it again today.

297
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,567
No, you're imagining things...

298
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:40,483
Oh, well...

299
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,108
You're probably being cautious
because of all the fuss about

300
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:44,942
that stalker the other day...

301
00:14:48,317 --> 00:14:52,483
Or, am I still an enemy target?

302
00:14:52,567 --> 00:14:55,150
Why do you ask that?

303
00:14:55,233 --> 00:14:56,858
No particular reason...

304
00:14:56,942 --> 00:15:00,400
It's just that a lot of strange
stuff has happened lately.

305
00:15:03,483 --> 00:15:05,567
Well, the problem isn't
a stalker, Chidori.

306
00:15:05,650 --> 00:15:07,483
There's another Mithril
operative out there assigned

307
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,317
to you as a backup unit.

308
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,900
Is it someone I know?

309
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,150
Like Kurz?

310
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:14,608
No, it's not anyone you know.

311
00:15:14,692 --> 00:15:16,275
We've never met.

312
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,942
Oh, I see...

313
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:20,233
His true identity
remains unknown...

314
00:15:20,317 --> 00:15:23,483
That's because he
never shows himself.

315
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:27,733
Does that mean I'd just be on
my own if I got attacked again?

316
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:37,442
The truth is...

317
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:39,692
when I really think about it...

318
00:15:39,775 --> 00:15:41,942
I feel safest with you.

319
00:15:45,692 --> 00:15:48,025
Thank you.

320
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:49,525
You're welcome.

321
00:15:52,358 --> 00:15:54,317
Would you turn your head a
little to the right for me?

322
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:54,858
Hm?

323
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:55,567
Sure.

324
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:56,567
NO, no! Not THAT way!

325
00:15:56,650 --> 00:15:58,150
I said turn RIGHT!

326
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:11,983
Hmm, I think I'm actually
getting the hang of this.

327
00:16:19,692 --> 00:16:21,317
Okay, we're all done!

328
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:48,608
Oh, wait a second,
I forgot to RINSE, didn't I?

329
00:16:58,775 --> 00:17:01,942
Hey, you two aren't scheduled
to sortie today, are you?

330
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,275
Whoa, wait a minute...

331
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:07,025
whaddya think you're...

332
00:17:07,108 --> 00:17:08,108
What's goin' on?

333
00:17:08,192 --> 00:17:09,983
You're getting all frisky on me!

334
00:17:12,483 --> 00:17:13,400
Sure!

335
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:14,817
I'll meet you
there in a minute.

336
00:17:29,942 --> 00:17:30,692
Whaa?

337
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:32,817
My little kittens left me?

338
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,525
What in the hell kind of problem
did they ever have with me?

339
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:36,900
Sure, they're half my age,

340
00:17:36,983 --> 00:17:39,442
but I never slacked off
and I always satisfied them!

341
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,442
I'd rather not know
about THAT, sir!

342
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:43,775
But they've taken a model
M Codarl and I think they're...

343
00:17:43,858 --> 00:17:44,317
Huh?

344
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,525
What was that?

345
00:17:45,608 --> 00:17:47,483
Oh, what the hell am I
talking to you for?

346
00:17:47,567 --> 00:17:49,108
Put them on the damn line!

347
00:17:49,192 --> 00:17:49,983
Y--Yes sir!

348
00:17:50,067 --> 00:17:51,233
I'll switch you over.

349
00:17:56,525 --> 00:18:00,192
You two little darlings,
can hear me, can't you?

350
00:18:00,275 --> 00:18:02,483
Just what do you
think you're doing?

351
00:18:02,567 --> 00:18:03,567
What do you want?

352
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:06,067
That's an expensive toy,
sweetie!

353
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:08,817
You can't just trot off
and "frolic around" in it!

354
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:11,150
It's not your business anymore.

355
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:15,192
From now on, the two of us
will do as we please.

356
00:18:15,275 --> 00:18:17,525
Well, not without
orders, kitten.

357
00:18:17,608 --> 00:18:19,817
You're not taking that
thing to drop in for tea

358
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:22,567
with our friends from
Mithril, now, are you?

359
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,483
Of course we are.

360
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:28,858
They're all going to die,
for what they did to Sensei.

361
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:33,650
Arrgghhh!

362
00:18:36,983 --> 00:18:39,358
Hey, I'm sorry
I only had leftovers.

363
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:40,525
No, I like it.

364
00:18:40,608 --> 00:18:41,775
Thank you.

365
00:18:45,483 --> 00:18:46,192
Is something wrong?

366
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:46,900
What?

367
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,108
No...

368
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:51,192
Well, you know...

369
00:18:51,275 --> 00:18:52,567
how you're always walking around

370
00:18:52,650 --> 00:18:55,317
with a bunch of scary
weapons hidden all over you?

371
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,608
Yeah.

372
00:18:56,692 --> 00:18:57,942
Do you have anything

373
00:18:58,025 --> 00:19:00,400
in that collection that's
not made to kill people?

374
00:19:00,483 --> 00:19:03,692
You see, I was kind of
thinking of getting a weapon.

375
00:19:03,775 --> 00:19:06,067
I believe I may have exactly
what you're looking for.

376
00:19:07,358 --> 00:19:09,400
Now, keep the tear gas,
handcuffs, flashlight,

377
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:11,608
mini-baton, taser, brass
knuckles and the disposable

378
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:14,650
stun gun with you at all times,
and that should be a good start.

379
00:19:14,733 --> 00:19:17,400
I have no idea where you
keep all that stuff...

380
00:19:17,483 --> 00:19:19,650
But even something like
this looks so dangerous that

381
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:21,817
I think I'd end up
killing somebody.

382
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,108
It sends a high-powered electric
shock through the wires,

383
00:19:24,192 --> 00:19:26,942
but it lasts only for
a small fraction of a second.

384
00:19:27,025 --> 00:19:28,817
It won't kill a healthy man.

385
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,608
Okay, that's a normal man,
but what about women,

386
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,150
children or old people, Sousuke?

387
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,275
Chidori, you cannot afford

388
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:37,608
to have mercy in
a situation like that.

389
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:41,608
Remaining idle in front of your
attacker is not a wise decision.

390
00:19:41,692 --> 00:19:43,108
You must always
put yourself first

391
00:19:43,192 --> 00:19:45,608
in a life or death situation.

392
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,108
I'm very grateful
for everything today.

393
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:53,692
I'd be glad to pay you back
by cutting your hair sometime.

394
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:55,358
Absolutely not!

395
00:19:59,692 --> 00:20:02,650
You should surprise Kyoko with
your new--and--improved look.

396
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:03,900
I think you're right.

397
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,025
And please don't forget
to return my notebook, okay?

398
00:20:08,108 --> 00:20:09,025
Yes, of course.

399
00:20:09,108 --> 00:20:10,817
And thanks again for everything.

400
00:20:10,900 --> 00:20:13,233
I'm serious, if you forget it
like you've done before,

401
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,275
you have to go back
and get it, Sousuke.

402
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:17,900
No, I promise I won't
forget it this time.

403
00:20:25,317 --> 00:20:27,317
I should probably be going.

404
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,108
Mm--hmm.

405
00:20:28,192 --> 00:20:29,400
Talk to ya later.

406
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:30,983
See you tomorrow.

407
00:20:42,858 --> 00:20:45,817
Maybe I should pick out some
clothes for him next time.

408
00:21:01,067 --> 00:21:05,067
The truth is I feel
safest with you.

409
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,608
All right.

410
00:23:47,983 --> 00:23:49,442
I didn't want to leave.

411
00:23:49,525 --> 00:23:51,983
And I didn't mean
to abandon you either.

412
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:53,233
An ominous order.

413
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:56,150
Plus a bitter exchange
of words with a ghost.

414
00:23:56,233 --> 00:24:00,942
Next time: "Left Behind." I
can't dispute this direct order.

415
00:24:01,025 --> 00:24:02,567
I just feel...

416
00:24:02,650 --> 00:24:03,775
powerless.
