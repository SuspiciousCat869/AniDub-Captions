1
00:01:59,317 --> 00:02:00,483
Sousuke!

2
00:02:01,817 --> 00:02:02,858
That hurt, you know.

3
00:02:04,108 --> 00:02:05,567
Do you know whose car
you're vandalizing?

4
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:07,608
Unknown, and that's
why I'm investigating

5
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:09,442
this suspicious vehicle.

6
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:11,275
Suspicious vehicle?

7
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:12,817
Exactly.

8
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,067
Vehicles loaded with hidden
plastic explosives can be used

9
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,483
as deadly weapons.

10
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:19,483
The Middle East, 1993:
terrorists used such a vehicle

11
00:02:19,567 --> 00:02:21,733
to make an attack
on a US Army base.

12
00:02:22,733 --> 00:02:24,525
This is getting
painful, you know.

13
00:02:24,608 --> 00:02:27,567
This is Ms. Kagurazaka's
NEW CAR, Sousuke!

14
00:02:27,650 --> 00:02:30,442
I just saw her all happy and
getting ready to come wash it!

15
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,025
I won't have time
to reassemble it...

16
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:33,692
Then don't take it apart!

17
00:02:38,942 --> 00:02:40,358
This is Urzu 7.

18
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,817
2 and 6?

19
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,858
Understood.

20
00:02:44,942 --> 00:02:46,817
I'll head to the
site via route ten.

21
00:02:48,025 --> 00:02:49,775
Something's come up;
I have to go.

22
00:02:49,858 --> 00:02:51,025
Again?

23
00:02:51,108 --> 00:02:52,983
Now wait a minute, Sousuke!

24
00:02:53,067 --> 00:02:54,733
You can't just
leave her car like this,

25
00:02:54,817 --> 00:02:56,483
and we have mid--terms today!

26
00:02:56,567 --> 00:02:57,775
Come on, Sousuke!

27
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:59,817
Go inside, it's safer there.

28
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,817
And he's gone...

29
00:03:10,108 --> 00:03:12,483
Which is why it's impossible
to monitor the history,

30
00:03:12,567 --> 00:03:14,150
character and
financial situation

31
00:03:14,233 --> 00:03:16,233
of every Mithril operative.

32
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:18,567
In spite of this,
we want you to know

33
00:03:18,650 --> 00:03:21,025
that the Intelligence Division
accepts its responsibility

34
00:03:21,108 --> 00:03:22,733
regarding Captain
Bruno's compromise of

35
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:24,317
the Yangtzee tunnel incident.

36
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:27,567
After all, he was one of ours.

37
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:30,400
However, you must understand
that there is a practical limit

38
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:32,692
to what even WE can do
in these situations.

39
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,608
So is that your
"expert analysis"

40
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:36,192
after reviewing that report?

41
00:03:36,275 --> 00:03:38,025
That's not funny, Admiral.

42
00:03:38,108 --> 00:03:41,192
General Amit,
you're Intelligence Chief.

43
00:03:41,275 --> 00:03:43,525
Please add something to this.

44
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,567
Organization is the issue here.

45
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,733
Highly--paid mercenaries are
still mercenaries and that means

46
00:03:48,817 --> 00:03:52,567
that Mithril is vulnerable to
anyone with a large checkbook.

47
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:54,025
This was inevitable.

48
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:55,858
Certainly, none of us
have forgotten about

49
00:03:55,942 --> 00:03:59,775
the terrorist infiltration
aboard the TDD--1, have we?

50
00:04:00,942 --> 00:04:02,275
Capable commanders notice

51
00:04:02,358 --> 00:04:04,608
if their subordinates
are behaving suspiciously.

52
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,567
So it's obviously an issue with
the local chain of command.

53
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:10,483
Your comments about the
captain are way off--base!

54
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:13,358
Personnel background checks
should stop these incidents,

55
00:04:13,442 --> 00:04:14,567
General.

56
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:17,942
Background checks only stop
undesirables from entering

57
00:04:18,025 --> 00:04:19,567
the service.

58
00:04:19,650 --> 00:04:22,650
They don't govern their behavior
after training, Admiral Voda.

59
00:04:24,233 --> 00:04:26,233
We have a lot of
other work to take care of.

60
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,650
A good example is
Kaname Chidori, who for some

61
00:04:28,733 --> 00:04:31,817
unknown reason has been handled
by the Tactical Division.

62
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:34,608
Your "wait and see" attitude
is a waste of manpower,

63
00:04:34,692 --> 00:04:37,608
and I recommend that we
take her into our custody.

64
00:04:37,692 --> 00:04:40,317
General, it's my opinion that
we should take the utmost care

65
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,900
in handling Kaname Chidori.

66
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:45,233
Well, since the two of you
both happen to be Whispered,

67
00:04:45,317 --> 00:04:48,692
your statement doesn't surprise
me at all, Captain Testarossa.

68
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:54,650
And it seems
this meeting is over.

69
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,775
Could we please have your
opinion on this, Lord Mallory?

70
00:04:59,275 --> 00:05:01,650
The organizers of Mithril
have always been aware of the

71
00:05:01,733 --> 00:05:05,108
risks inherent in creating an
all--mercenary fighting force.

72
00:05:05,192 --> 00:05:08,775
Mithril is not bound by race,
religion or national borders,

73
00:05:08,858 --> 00:05:10,817
but rather, to the
ideal that we can prevent

74
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,400
international conflicts.

75
00:05:12,483 --> 00:05:14,942
Naturally, some countries
and terrorist organizations

76
00:05:15,025 --> 00:05:16,358
object to this.

77
00:05:16,442 --> 00:05:18,692
If I remember correctly,
there' s no one in this meeting

78
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:21,650
that didn't assume the
same risk when you signed on.

79
00:05:21,733 --> 00:05:23,317
Am I wrong?

80
00:05:24,692 --> 00:05:25,942
Very well then.

81
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:28,525
Let's end this bickering
over who is to blame here.

82
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:29,942
And of course,

83
00:05:30,025 --> 00:05:32,650
start considering new
infiltration countermeasures.

84
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,942
Please conduct a review
of your current procedures and

85
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:37,608
propose workable countermeasures
for these threats.

86
00:05:37,692 --> 00:05:38,733
Thank you.

87
00:05:38,817 --> 00:05:40,192
That is all.

88
00:05:47,233 --> 00:05:49,150
Happens every time, doesn't it?

89
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,525
Tactical division demands
better information and then

90
00:05:51,608 --> 00:05:53,192
the intelligence
division fires back

91
00:05:53,275 --> 00:05:55,275
with "we're doing
the best we can!"

92
00:05:55,358 --> 00:05:58,108
I suppose it's that way
in most organizations.

93
00:05:58,192 --> 00:05:59,733
I know, sir.

94
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:01,150
I'm not so sure.

95
00:06:01,233 --> 00:06:03,108
Submarine command
may not suit you--

96
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:05,608
perhaps something along
the lines of research.

97
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,400
Tessa, don't you
think it's about time

98
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:08,858
you considered stepping down?

99
00:06:08,942 --> 00:06:10,942
I'm not relinquishing my ship!

100
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,150
And I'm not going
to leave, Admiral!

101
00:06:15,692 --> 00:06:18,525
Yeah, and I know where you get
that stubborn streak of yours.

102
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:21,275
You're exactly like your
father when it comes to that.

103
00:06:21,358 --> 00:06:22,858
I apologize, uncle.

104
00:06:22,942 --> 00:06:26,317
Everyone here is important to
me; I can't consider leaving.

105
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,650
If Leonard were here...

106
00:06:27,733 --> 00:06:29,525
...I think that would
probably take half of this

107
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:32,817
responsibility you're feeling
off of your shoulders.

108
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:35,942
You know, I wonder
what he's up to these days?

109
00:06:39,067 --> 00:06:40,525
And more importantly,

110
00:06:40,608 --> 00:06:43,483
what in the hell are we gonna
do about that Bruno bastard?

111
00:06:43,567 --> 00:06:45,192
We're taking care of it...

112
00:06:45,275 --> 00:06:47,150
...at a remote location.

113
00:07:20,233 --> 00:07:22,358
La Bella Sicilia

114
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,442
I'm quite enthralled with her.

115
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,817
So you like Asian women, do you?

116
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,025
Oh, yes.

117
00:07:29,108 --> 00:07:31,692
Especially dark--haired
beauties like you.

118
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,483
I guess you're
American, aren't you?

119
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:36,025
So how do you know that?

120
00:07:36,108 --> 00:07:37,858
I spent two years in Baltimore.

121
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:39,025
It shows.

122
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:41,150
You seem different
from the other men here.

123
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:44,483
More "sophisticated,"
you could say.

124
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,692
So where did you get
your gift for flattery?

125
00:07:47,775 --> 00:07:49,025
Oh, I don't know.

126
00:07:49,108 --> 00:07:52,108
I've had quite a few
experiences here and there.

127
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:53,650
Is that right?

128
00:07:53,733 --> 00:07:56,817
You know, I never got around
to asking you what your name is?

129
00:07:57,858 --> 00:07:58,650
My name?

130
00:07:58,733 --> 00:08:00,067
Of course!

131
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,858
What's a night of hardcore
passion without being able

132
00:08:01,942 --> 00:08:03,983
to scream out your lover's name?

133
00:08:04,067 --> 00:08:05,358
Only that?

134
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,608
You're sure you don't
want to know anything else?

135
00:08:07,692 --> 00:08:09,317
Oh, well...

136
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:10,608
Of course I do.

137
00:08:10,692 --> 00:08:12,108
Everything.

138
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:14,025
Okay then...

139
00:08:14,108 --> 00:08:16,525
let me tell you...

140
00:08:16,608 --> 00:08:18,567
...everything, you bastard!!

141
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:22,108
Thanks for Nanking,
you ASSHOLE!

142
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:24,275
You can call me Melissa Mao!

143
00:08:24,358 --> 00:08:25,942
Sergeant Major!

144
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:27,525
Mitrhil Tactical Division...

145
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,025
from the Tuatha
De Danaan's SRT team.

146
00:08:30,108 --> 00:08:31,858
You remember them, right?!

147
00:08:31,942 --> 00:08:33,442
And not to mention...

148
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:37,025
I'm a bitch with an itch
to pull the trigger...

149
00:08:37,108 --> 00:08:39,858
...and put your traitor
ass out of my misery!!!

150
00:08:58,733 --> 00:09:01,358
Hey sis, chill out, okay?

151
00:09:01,442 --> 00:09:03,192
I was feeling
pretty uneasy there...

152
00:09:03,275 --> 00:09:05,733
...watching you from behind
those musty old drapes.

153
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:09,025
I only asked you for a gun,
what are you doing in here?

154
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:10,483
Is that any kind of welcome

155
00:09:10,567 --> 00:09:12,900
for the knight who was
protecting you from the shadows?

156
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:16,067
I feel the same way.

157
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:18,233
But we have to do this right.

158
00:09:18,317 --> 00:09:20,525
You know, sometimes
you actually make sense.

159
00:09:21,275 --> 00:09:22,900
That's because
this is the real me.

160
00:09:22,983 --> 00:09:25,192
I only pretend to be
a joker, you know.

161
00:09:26,858 --> 00:09:29,067
Maybe it's the
moon here in Sicily.

162
00:09:29,150 --> 00:09:31,858
But it feels like the goddess
of the night could cause even

163
00:09:31,942 --> 00:09:35,108
a hidden love to be revealed,
know what I mean?

164
00:09:35,192 --> 00:09:37,275
Did you know that
Hecate the night goddess

165
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,817
is also the goddess of revenge?

166
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:43,733
That lovely goddess' name fits
you just perfectly tonight.

167
00:09:46,442 --> 00:09:48,067
Get your mind out of the gutter!

168
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,233
We're surrounded by Mafiosi

169
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,317
and we have to get
the hell outta here.

170
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:53,483
And "back to reality"...

171
00:09:53,567 --> 00:09:54,108
Right.

172
00:09:54,192 --> 00:09:55,608
Let's get to work.

173
00:10:03,358 --> 00:10:04,567
What about the route to the car?

174
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,692
All the guards are
"taking a little nap".

175
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,817
Just past these bushes.

176
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:17,817
Okay.

177
00:10:20,858 --> 00:10:21,233
Oh...

178
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,483
hey!

179
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:29,650
I thought you said
they were all napping!

180
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:31,150
I didn't know
there were that many!

181
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,983
Great, backs against the wall...

182
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:36,817
...and this is the
only weapon we've got.

183
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,317
If I just had a rifle.

184
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,858
CRAP!

185
00:10:39,942 --> 00:10:41,692
Great, I'm gonna die; but at
least I'm taking you with me!

186
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,692
Hang on!

187
00:10:42,775 --> 00:10:44,275
Don't panic yet, Urzu 2.

188
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:45,817
Sousuke?!

189
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,650
You now have an escape route.

190
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:51,942
Sousuke!

191
00:10:52,025 --> 00:10:53,567
Don't you have mid--terms?

192
00:10:53,650 --> 00:10:54,608
Affirmative.

193
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:56,108
But your escape route
has changed.

194
00:10:56,192 --> 00:10:57,525
And I'm here to back you up.

195
00:10:57,608 --> 00:10:58,650
What happened?

196
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,483
The helicopter is --

197
00:11:00,567 --> 00:11:01,400
Drive, dammit!

198
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:02,650
Roger!

199
00:11:05,483 --> 00:11:07,442
The helicopter is set
to pick us up directly,

200
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:09,817
and I'm here to lead you
to the extraction point.

201
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:11,567
By the way, I like
your bathing suit.

202
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,317
It's evening wear,
you knucklehead!

203
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,525
Uh, guys...

204
00:11:16,442 --> 00:11:16,692
5...

205
00:11:16,775 --> 00:11:17,025
6...

206
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:17,358
7...

207
00:11:17,442 --> 00:11:17,692
8...

208
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:18,025
9...

209
00:11:19,108 --> 00:11:19,942
Thirteen of 'em?!

210
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:20,650
Jeez!

211
00:11:20,733 --> 00:11:21,983
We've gotta go faster!

212
00:11:22,067 --> 00:11:23,442
Negative.

213
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:24,983
An older vehicle like this
doesn't have adequate power.

214
00:11:25,817 --> 00:11:26,775
Dammit!

215
00:11:26,858 --> 00:11:27,442
Get down!

216
00:11:27,525 --> 00:11:29,025
They're gonna shoot!

217
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:33,858
Shit!

218
00:11:33,942 --> 00:11:35,317
Bulletproof...

219
00:11:37,192 --> 00:11:39,108
Maybe we should just
kill him and dump his ass.

220
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:42,442
Yeah, that option's starting
to sound a lot more attractive.

221
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:43,692
Do we need to lighten our load?

222
00:11:43,775 --> 00:11:45,275
Yeah, or else they're
gonna catch up with us!

223
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:47,775
Throwing out his body won't be
enough, and I think the weapons

224
00:11:47,858 --> 00:11:50,400
in the back seat are
probably weighing us down, too.

225
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:51,608
Let's scuttle everything.

226
00:11:51,692 --> 00:11:52,983
Weapons?

227
00:11:55,817 --> 00:11:57,317
Why didn't you tell us?!

228
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,692
I thought I did...

229
00:11:58,775 --> 00:11:59,858
But you didn't.

230
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:00,983
Dumb ass!

231
00:12:10,525 --> 00:12:12,817
What's all the
noise for, honey?

232
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:13,692
You're enjoying this!

233
00:12:13,775 --> 00:12:15,233
Damn right I am!

234
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:19,692
All right!

235
00:12:19,775 --> 00:12:21,275
Let's get this party started!

236
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:22,983
Are you guys ready down there?

237
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:23,692
Any time.

238
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:24,817
Anywhere.

239
00:12:26,025 --> 00:12:28,358
ROCK AND ROLL!

240
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:45,650
Boy, this is
one hell of a parade!

241
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,608
We're definitely keeping the
neighbors awake tonight!

242
00:12:48,692 --> 00:12:49,483
Cover me, Kurz!

243
00:12:49,567 --> 00:12:51,150
Right!

244
00:12:58,733 --> 00:12:59,650
Howdy, neighbors!

245
00:12:59,733 --> 00:13:01,483
Wake up and smell
the destruction!

246
00:13:01,567 --> 00:13:02,525
Turning!

247
00:13:03,525 --> 00:13:05,275
How 'bout a little notice?!

248
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,400
I said I need some noti...

249
00:13:18,483 --> 00:13:19,358
Pervert!

250
00:13:20,483 --> 00:13:21,483
That hurt!

251
00:13:21,567 --> 00:13:23,275
Try it again, and
I'll CAP your ass!

252
00:13:23,358 --> 00:13:23,650
Yeah!

253
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:24,650
Yeah!

254
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:26,608
Clearing ahead!

255
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:30,442
Let's try THIS party favor!

256
00:13:42,983 --> 00:13:44,275
The Mithril team got him.

257
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:46,150
It looks like
they blew our chance.

258
00:13:46,233 --> 00:13:47,608
No it's perfect!

259
00:13:47,692 --> 00:13:49,358
They saved us the
trouble of going in

260
00:13:49,442 --> 00:13:51,400
and getting that sorry skidmark.

261
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:54,150
So be a good boy and
show our thanks by silencing

262
00:13:54,233 --> 00:13:55,983
all of them, okay?

263
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,108
Roger!

264
00:14:00,108 --> 00:14:01,233
Nah.

265
00:14:01,317 --> 00:14:03,400
I can't tonight,
I'm in the middle of tests.

266
00:14:03,483 --> 00:14:03,858
Yeah.

267
00:14:03,942 --> 00:14:04,567
Yeah.

268
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:06,858
Yeah, I'm doing my best.

269
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:09,567
Umm, so--so, I guess.

270
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,108
So, when are we
getting together?

271
00:14:12,192 --> 00:14:13,233
Yeah!

272
00:14:14,442 --> 00:14:15,900
Hey, Kaname!

273
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:17,900
So, did you study
for the test today?

274
00:14:17,983 --> 00:14:19,067
Sorta.

275
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:20,192
Did you?

276
00:14:20,275 --> 00:14:21,233
No way!

277
00:14:22,692 --> 00:14:24,858
Hey, I know it's not
any of my business...

278
00:14:24,942 --> 00:14:27,192
but I noticed Sousuke
was absent again.

279
00:14:27,275 --> 00:14:29,567
How can he just skip out
on all the tests?

280
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,858
Really, I wonder if that idiot
even cares about passing.

281
00:14:32,942 --> 00:14:34,817
You could call his cell phone.

282
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:38,067
I bet he'll show up if you
just pressure him a little.

283
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,233
For REAL?

284
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:40,150
Useless!

285
00:14:40,233 --> 00:14:41,525
Why even bother?

286
00:14:41,608 --> 00:14:43,608
I can never get a hold
of him at a time like this!

287
00:14:43,692 --> 00:14:46,567
I never know where is or what
he's doing and don't even THINK

288
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:48,317
about trying to
reach his voice mail.

289
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,275
JEEZ!

290
00:14:49,358 --> 00:14:50,483
He should be
more considerate!

291
00:14:50,567 --> 00:14:51,608
I'm the one trying to stay

292
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:53,150
in touch with the
idiot all the time!

293
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,858
He picked up for me!

294
00:14:58,775 --> 00:15:00,192
No way!

295
00:15:02,025 --> 00:15:03,483
And then what...?

296
00:15:07,067 --> 00:15:08,817
Hey, are you there, Sousuke?

297
00:15:08,900 --> 00:15:09,358
Chidori?

298
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,233
What's wrong?

299
00:15:10,317 --> 00:15:11,817
The static is horrible.

300
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,067
Where are you?

301
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:14,525
Canicatti.

302
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:16,442
Uh, karate?

303
00:15:16,525 --> 00:15:17,650
What?

304
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:21,358
Listen, we've already started
taking the mid--terms.

305
00:15:21,442 --> 00:15:22,650
Did you forget?

306
00:15:22,733 --> 00:15:25,983
I remember, but something
unavoidable came up.

307
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,525
Don't give me that excuse.

308
00:15:27,608 --> 00:15:30,400
I even lent you my notes
on Classical Literature.

309
00:15:30,483 --> 00:15:32,858
And after you pulled that
stunt, I had to calm down

310
00:15:32,942 --> 00:15:34,942
Ms. Kagurazaka about her car.

311
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,858
Yes, I'm very sorry about that.

312
00:15:36,942 --> 00:15:38,983
Yeah, well sorry
isn't gonna cut it.

313
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:41,400
Do you know how much of
a TOLL this takes on me?

314
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:42,483
I know.

315
00:15:42,567 --> 00:15:43,358
No you don't!

316
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:44,775
Not one bit!

317
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,150
Are you listening?

318
00:15:46,233 --> 00:15:47,525
Of course I am!

319
00:15:47,608 --> 00:15:49,275
I'M GOING THROUGH!

320
00:15:49,358 --> 00:15:50,275
What was that?

321
00:15:50,358 --> 00:15:51,150
Nothing.

322
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,275
I'm talking while I'm driving.

323
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:58,942
You said you're talking and
driving at the same time?

324
00:15:59,025 --> 00:15:59,733
Affirmative!

325
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:01,317
That's dangerous!

326
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:03,983
It's illegal to talk on the cell
phone while you're driving --

327
00:16:04,067 --> 00:16:05,775
and do you even have a license?!

328
00:16:05,858 --> 00:16:07,608
Just pull over
and stop the car.

329
00:16:08,483 --> 00:16:10,608
If I stop I won't be able
to take the make--up tests,

330
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:11,275
Chidori!

331
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:12,442
Huh?

332
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,442
Oh, hey, pretty lady!

333
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:16,733
Look, your grades
are in serious trouble.

334
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:18,942
So how come you
keep cutting class?

335
00:16:19,025 --> 00:16:20,317
No choice--I'm on a mission!

336
00:16:20,400 --> 00:16:23,108
Yeah, but you can't
tell the teacher that.

337
00:16:23,192 --> 00:16:25,483
They're gonna hold you back
if you don't pass!

338
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:27,025
Yes, I know that!

339
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,650
Do you want to repeat a grade?

340
00:16:28,733 --> 00:16:31,858
Everyone else will end up
graduating before you do!

341
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:33,233
That would be a problem!

342
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:34,942
It'd be a problem for ME.

343
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:36,150
What was that?

344
00:16:36,233 --> 00:16:37,567
Oh, nothing.

345
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,442
I can't hear you!

346
00:16:38,525 --> 00:16:39,358
Say again!

347
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:40,442
Just one more!

348
00:16:40,525 --> 00:16:42,358
Hey, why're you
still wearing panties?!

349
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:42,942
What?

350
00:16:43,025 --> 00:16:43,900
Who's that?

351
00:16:43,983 --> 00:16:44,775
Ignore that!

352
00:16:44,858 --> 00:16:45,900
Now what were you about to say?

353
00:16:45,983 --> 00:16:46,942
Just forget it.

354
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,733
It's like you're
in your own world.

355
00:16:48,817 --> 00:16:49,442
No.

356
00:16:49,525 --> 00:16:51,067
The surroundings are...

357
00:16:51,150 --> 00:16:52,192
...really noisy.

358
00:16:52,275 --> 00:16:54,650
You know something, Sousuke?

359
00:16:54,733 --> 00:16:55,900
Sometimes I get the feeling you

360
00:16:55,983 --> 00:16:58,942
never take what
I have to say seriously.

361
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:00,483
That's not true!

362
00:17:00,567 --> 00:17:01,442
Whatever...

363
00:17:01,525 --> 00:17:02,650
I do!

364
00:17:02,733 --> 00:17:04,400
I always take you seriously!

365
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:05,608
You have my total attention!

366
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,650
GET DOWN!

367
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:08,817
What's going on?

368
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:09,733
Hey, are you there?

369
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:10,567
Sousuke!

370
00:17:10,650 --> 00:17:11,942
Sousuke!

371
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:15,942
Hey, I wanna play!

372
00:17:16,025 --> 00:17:17,525
The situation is secure.

373
00:17:17,608 --> 00:17:19,733
So what did you
want to talk about?

374
00:17:19,817 --> 00:17:20,983
Never mind.

375
00:17:21,067 --> 00:17:22,358
What?

376
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:24,942
Just get back to school
as quickly as you can, okay?

377
00:17:25,025 --> 00:17:25,608
Okay...

378
00:17:25,692 --> 00:17:26,692
Dork.

379
00:17:27,733 --> 00:17:29,150
So, what's wrong, huh?

380
00:17:30,525 --> 00:17:31,983
A.S. at 8 o'clock!

381
00:17:32,067 --> 00:17:33,025
This isn't good.

382
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,192
Yeah, no kidding.

383
00:17:34,275 --> 00:17:35,233
Floor it, Sousuke!

384
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:36,567
Roger!

385
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:39,775
Savages!

386
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:42,067
So even the mafia's
buyin' 'em nowadays!

387
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:43,650
Never got a briefing about THAT!

388
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,025
Are those things for real?

389
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:46,233
No kidding!

390
00:17:46,317 --> 00:17:48,150
Sousuke, we need to go faster!

391
00:17:48,233 --> 00:17:50,233
Those things can go over
a hundred, ya know!

392
00:17:50,317 --> 00:17:51,650
This is all it's got.

393
00:17:51,733 --> 00:17:53,442
I can't make it go any faster.

394
00:17:53,525 --> 00:17:54,650
Incoming!

395
00:18:29,608 --> 00:18:30,900
An M9?

396
00:18:30,983 --> 00:18:32,358
That's one of ours, right?

397
00:18:32,442 --> 00:18:33,358
But where's he from?

398
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:34,400
I dunno.

399
00:18:54,025 --> 00:18:55,983
Looks like our ride's here.

400
00:18:56,067 --> 00:18:58,192
Whaddaya mean
the mission failed?!

401
00:18:58,275 --> 00:19:00,442
I'm afraid all three
savages were destroyed...

402
00:19:00,525 --> 00:19:03,525
But the operators were
killed and that should prevent

403
00:19:03,608 --> 00:19:04,942
any information leaks!

404
00:19:05,025 --> 00:19:07,150
Mister Gates!

405
00:19:09,442 --> 00:19:11,275
It doesn't matter,
because they got Bruno,

406
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:13,025
you stupid fuck--up!

407
00:19:13,108 --> 00:19:14,775
You fucked up
stealing the Arbalest.

408
00:19:14,858 --> 00:19:16,317
You fucked up killing Bruno.

409
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:17,567
You're a double fuck--up!

410
00:19:17,650 --> 00:19:19,650
And I don't fucking LIKE that!

411
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:27,150
And I can't afford
to keep on letting you

412
00:19:27,233 --> 00:19:29,525
fuck up while
you're on my watch.

413
00:19:29,608 --> 00:19:32,692
Somehow, I need to get back
on a winning streak.

414
00:19:32,775 --> 00:19:35,275
I think it's time the
two us took our leave.

415
00:19:35,358 --> 00:19:36,858
After we get the item?

416
00:19:36,942 --> 00:19:39,900
Yes, and then we'll
be free to do as we wish.

417
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,275
You can tell us, can't you?

418
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:46,233
Who in the hell was in
the black M9, commander?

419
00:19:46,317 --> 00:19:47,608
That's classified.

420
00:19:47,692 --> 00:19:48,442
Even to me?

421
00:19:48,525 --> 00:19:50,400
I'm the SRT commander!

422
00:19:50,483 --> 00:19:51,650
You'll find out soon enough.

423
00:19:51,733 --> 00:19:53,400
Be quick with your report
when you get back.

424
00:19:53,483 --> 00:19:54,692
TDD--1 out.

425
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:57,067
God damn it!

426
00:19:57,150 --> 00:19:58,608
Why the hell does
that old bastard

427
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,608
always have to be like that?

428
00:20:01,775 --> 00:20:02,650
No kiddin'.

429
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:03,733
Right, Sousuke?

430
00:20:03,817 --> 00:20:05,400
Hm?

431
00:20:06,775 --> 00:20:08,358
You getting ready
for mid--terms?

432
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:09,608
Affirmative.

433
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:11,775
I can't afford to fail
any more of my classes.

434
00:20:11,858 --> 00:20:13,733
If your grades are that bad,
don't you think you shoulda

435
00:20:13,817 --> 00:20:15,733
stayed in Japan
and studied more?

436
00:20:15,817 --> 00:20:17,817
Kaname's worried about you, too.

437
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:20,025
I had a job to do here,
and what do you think

438
00:20:20,108 --> 00:20:22,317
would've happened
to you two if I hadn't come?

439
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,733
We'da been fine.

440
00:20:23,817 --> 00:20:24,692
Right, sis?

441
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,233
Hmm...

442
00:20:26,317 --> 00:20:30,942
Well, I did have some backup
plans--you know, just in case.

443
00:20:31,025 --> 00:20:32,483
I see.

444
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,275
Well, it's true that
you did save us back there.

445
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,692
But I'm starting to worry
about you a little bit.

446
00:20:37,775 --> 00:20:38,442
What I mean is...

447
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:40,025
About my tests?

448
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,942
No, I'm talking about everything
you've got going on right now.

449
00:20:43,025 --> 00:20:46,275
You're guarding Kaname,
participating in missions

450
00:20:46,358 --> 00:20:50,067
like this, and operating
the Arbalest on top of that.

451
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:52,775
Isn't it getting to be
too much of a burden?

452
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:55,608
Af first, I thought you'd
be okay for a little while,

453
00:20:55,692 --> 00:20:58,400
because you were handling all
that work without any problems.

454
00:20:58,483 --> 00:20:59,317
But lately...

455
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,650
I haven't jeopardized a mission.

456
00:21:00,733 --> 00:21:02,067
No, not yet.

457
00:21:02,150 --> 00:21:04,233
But there's a limit
to how much you can handle,

458
00:21:04,317 --> 00:21:06,817
no matter how short
on personnel we are.

459
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,983
And there's certainly no
reason that you have to be

460
00:21:09,067 --> 00:21:10,983
the only one guarding Kaname.

461
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:15,650
So what do YOU think
about all that, Sousuke?

462
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:16,858
What about?

463
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,900
Your plans for the future!

464
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:21,067
Follow my orders.

465
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:22,525
That's all.

466
00:21:22,608 --> 00:21:24,067
God dammit Sousuke!

467
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:26,525
You always fall back on that
and I'm trying to talk to you

468
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,400
about your life and your FUTURE!

469
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:29,733
You're only seventeen!

470
00:21:29,817 --> 00:21:31,525
Haven't you even given
a little bit of thought

471
00:21:31,608 --> 00:21:32,900
to the rest of your life?

472
00:21:32,983 --> 00:21:35,108
You're just using your
"mission" and your "orders"

473
00:21:35,192 --> 00:21:36,775
to run away from everything!

474
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:37,567
No, I'm...

475
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:38,608
not running.

476
00:21:38,692 --> 00:21:39,817
Oh, really?!

477
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,108
I guess life is easy
just following orders

478
00:21:42,192 --> 00:21:44,900
and not questioning
anything at all, isn't it?

479
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:48,442
Aw c'mon--why don't
you give him a break?

480
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:51,108
I just think he could
use a little guidance.

481
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:54,358
Well, buddy, don't strain your
brain with all that schoolwork.

482
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,858
We faked the documents to
get you in, so it's not like

483
00:21:56,942 --> 00:21:59,650
you have to kill yourself
to graduate, you know?

484
00:22:13,150 --> 00:22:14,692
Future...

485
00:23:48,483 --> 00:23:50,275
Quiet times have returned.

486
00:23:50,358 --> 00:23:51,692
The days go by.

487
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,358
The seasons change.

488
00:23:53,442 --> 00:23:55,733
Drenched in a peace
I had never known before,

489
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:57,650
I dozed off in the silence.

490
00:23:59,108 --> 00:24:01,525
Next time: "Edge of Heaven"

491
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,192
Dark clouds gather
near without a sound.
