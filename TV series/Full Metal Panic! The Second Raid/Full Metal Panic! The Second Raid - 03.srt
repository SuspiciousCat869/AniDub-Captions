1
00:02:12,650 --> 00:02:15,567
Looks like you fell for it,
Kumodoshin, or whatever

2
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,108
you call yourself and
you're trapped like a rat!

3
00:02:18,192 --> 00:02:20,775
What do you think
you're going to do now?

4
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,858
Run away, Lord Kumodoshin!

5
00:02:22,942 --> 00:02:23,775
Hey!

6
00:02:23,858 --> 00:02:25,442
Shut your mouth,
you impudent...

7
00:02:25,525 --> 00:02:26,567
HARLOT!

8
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,442
Bastard...

9
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:36,025
Bring me back his
heart in a bag!!!

10
00:02:36,108 --> 00:02:37,608
Kill him!

11
00:02:42,983 --> 00:02:45,525
We interrupt your regularly
scheduled program to...

12
00:02:45,608 --> 00:02:47,567
Come on, that was the best part!

13
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,692
The news can wait
a measly 3 minutes!

14
00:02:49,775 --> 00:02:53,233
That was Detarame
Dacchanbaru's ultimate scene!

15
00:02:53,317 --> 00:02:55,817
Hang on a minute -- this appears
to be very important news,

16
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:56,692
Kaname.

17
00:02:56,775 --> 00:02:58,692
How can you say that, Sousuke?

18
00:02:58,775 --> 00:03:01,817
"The Amazing Kumodoshin" is
a super--rare period drama...

19
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,150
This is Urzu 7.

20
00:03:04,233 --> 00:03:05,233
Right...

21
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:07,775
I just found out
from a TV news report.

22
00:03:07,858 --> 00:03:08,983
Roger, Code 3.

23
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,317
I'll head there
immediately via Route B2.

24
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,858
Hey, are you listening to me?

25
00:03:13,942 --> 00:03:15,483
I have to go --
urgent business.

26
00:03:15,567 --> 00:03:16,858
You have to go where?

27
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:18,150
I'll be back in two days.

28
00:03:18,233 --> 00:03:19,442
But you can't go!

29
00:03:19,525 --> 00:03:22,192
We have an algebra quiz
tomorrow, you know!

30
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,733
Be sure to go
straight home if you can.

31
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:27,025
Huh?

32
00:03:27,108 --> 00:03:27,942
Hey, wait...

33
00:03:28,025 --> 00:03:29,358
Sousuke!

34
00:03:29,442 --> 00:03:30,692
According to the announcement
by local authorities...

35
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:32,358
He took off.

36
00:03:32,442 --> 00:03:33,233
Man...

37
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:34,733
...North China diplomatic corps

38
00:03:34,817 --> 00:03:37,483
is equipped with at least five
AS units, and is currently

39
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,858
engaged in a battle
inside the city of Nanking.

40
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,983
Ah, yes...

41
00:04:02,067 --> 00:04:04,275
I find big fireworks...

42
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:08,025
Just as invigorating
as tiny asses!

43
00:04:08,108 --> 00:04:09,317
"Asses," Mr. Gates?

44
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,358
Oh, just forget it.

45
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,358
UNBELIEVEABLE!!!

46
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:36,400
Gates has broken through
the line of defense!

47
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:39,608
His moves are pure ART!

48
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:42,900
And the audience is
going freakin' nuts!

49
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,358
Will he make it?

50
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,650
Its final stretch of
the Nanking Grand Prix!

51
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:50,983
You should wear a helmet, sir.

52
00:04:51,067 --> 00:04:53,692
But helmets make you

53
00:04:53,775 --> 00:04:55,317
go bald...

54
00:05:03,067 --> 00:05:05,442
The ceasefire negotiation
meeting between North and South

55
00:05:05,525 --> 00:05:08,275
China was attacked by
an armed terrorist group.

56
00:05:08,358 --> 00:05:12,733
Seven hours ago in Nanking, a
city in the Yangtze River basin.

57
00:05:14,025 --> 00:05:15,275
Sorry I'm late.

58
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:24,317
Three AS units abducted five
associates of the North China

59
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,150
diplomatic corps
from the assembly hall.

60
00:05:28,608 --> 00:05:31,483
They put up fierce resistance
as they escaped overland,

61
00:05:31,567 --> 00:05:32,983
and they're currently
holding their position

62
00:05:33,067 --> 00:05:35,025
in the Cross--
Yangtze River Tunnel.

63
00:05:35,108 --> 00:05:38,650
They are call themselves
"The Lost 500,000 Men,"

64
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:41,150
but existence of such a
terrorist organization has

65
00:05:41,233 --> 00:05:42,733
not yet been confirmed.

66
00:05:42,817 --> 00:05:45,775
We already have
them surrounded, and...

67
00:05:45,858 --> 00:05:47,025
Madame Captain.

68
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:48,650
Um, Yes?

69
00:05:48,733 --> 00:05:50,608
Do you concur
with that assessment?

70
00:05:50,692 --> 00:05:51,442
Yes.

71
00:05:51,525 --> 00:05:52,983
Please continue.

72
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:54,567
Ma'am.

73
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:57,525
This is the location currently
being held by terrorist forces.

74
00:05:57,608 --> 00:06:01,567
The Cross--Yangtze River Tunnel
in Nanking spans 4 kilometers

75
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:04,275
and is recognized as the
largest man-made structure

76
00:06:04,358 --> 00:06:05,692
in the region.

77
00:06:05,775 --> 00:06:08,275
This is where we will
conduct our rescue operation.

78
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:11,775
That's one big tunnel.

79
00:06:11,858 --> 00:06:13,567
And extremely complex.

80
00:06:15,025 --> 00:06:17,067
Because it was built with
technology that became

81
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,483
more obsolete as the civil war
progressed, it has been modified

82
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:24,733
several times, creating numerous
shafts and inclined passages,

83
00:06:24,817 --> 00:06:26,650
which added to the
tunnel's complexity.

84
00:06:26,733 --> 00:06:28,442
A tunnel in name only.

85
00:06:28,525 --> 00:06:30,150
It looks more like a dungeon.

86
00:06:30,233 --> 00:06:31,025
Right.

87
00:06:31,108 --> 00:06:33,108
You could say it's a labyrinth.

88
00:06:33,192 --> 00:06:36,067
With the exception of some work
shafts, it's wide enough for

89
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:38,650
an AS to execute
tactical operations.

90
00:06:38,733 --> 00:06:42,567
Six enemy AS Savages are
probably lying in wait for you.

91
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,775
Expect traps.

92
00:06:43,858 --> 00:06:46,442
Local forces are ill-
prepared for this.

93
00:06:46,525 --> 00:06:47,692
Looks easy enough.

94
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:50,358
I mean, our arm slaves
are the M9 models.

95
00:06:50,442 --> 00:06:53,025
We can only hope
it'll be that easy.

96
00:06:53,108 --> 00:06:55,983
Three infantry teams will
infiltrate from these points.

97
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:57,650
And once they have
secured the route,

98
00:06:57,733 --> 00:07:00,192
three AS units will move in.

99
00:07:00,275 --> 00:07:02,900
This AS team will
consist of Mao, Weber...

100
00:07:02,983 --> 00:07:06,817
and Sagara, and the rest will
remain with their own squads.

101
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:09,233
Given the nature of the
location, the use of

102
00:07:09,317 --> 00:07:13,317
high-explosive and hypervelocity
munitions is unwise.

103
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,650
You've been given a list of
all confirmed enemy logistics,

104
00:07:16,733 --> 00:07:19,192
but keep in mind that
this is all tentative...

105
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:21,400
Why not stop giving us these
handouts and just send us

106
00:07:21,483 --> 00:07:22,942
the data?

107
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:25,108
Once we confirm the
location where the hostages

108
00:07:25,192 --> 00:07:27,525
are being held, we will
provide you with details

109
00:07:27,608 --> 00:07:29,192
on the routes and time tables.

110
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:32,400
So memorize the distance and
configuration of the shafts.

111
00:07:32,483 --> 00:07:33,858
And I mean thoroughly.

112
00:07:33,942 --> 00:07:35,192
But, sir!

113
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:37,817
The figures on these docs
don't match up at all!

114
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,442
It says right here
that this description's

115
00:07:39,525 --> 00:07:41,108
probably not accurate.

116
00:07:41,192 --> 00:07:42,775
An' this one's even sketchier...

117
00:07:43,733 --> 00:07:46,025
Yeah it's just like
the Cretans' paradox.

118
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:47,650
What is that?

119
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:50,483
It's the paradox when a Cretan
says, "All Cretans are liars."

120
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,150
It's impossible to
prove it true or false.

121
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:58,525
Save the lecture on
Epimenides for later.

122
00:07:58,608 --> 00:08:01,692
Intelligence has dispatched
a communications engineer

123
00:08:01,775 --> 00:08:03,525
and he will meet you on
site in order to improve

124
00:08:03,608 --> 00:08:05,900
your radio signal
within the tunnels.

125
00:08:05,983 --> 00:08:08,108
This is Vincent Bruno.

126
00:08:08,192 --> 00:08:10,942
He should instruct you on
the use of the repeaters prior

127
00:08:11,025 --> 00:08:12,567
to the operation.

128
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:13,650
Understood.

129
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:14,358
Yes, sir.

130
00:08:14,442 --> 00:08:15,775
Sir.

131
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,525
This concludes my briefing.

132
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:19,650
Captain, take over
if you please.

133
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:20,983
Yes.

134
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:30,192
Because of international
attention, this operation

135
00:08:30,275 --> 00:08:32,192
is considerably more
delicate than the one in

136
00:08:32,275 --> 00:08:34,358
the Khanka Autonomous Region.

137
00:08:34,442 --> 00:08:36,692
The inland location of
the operation will prevent

138
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:39,858
the Danaan from providing
you with rapid support.

139
00:08:39,942 --> 00:08:43,108
My "Theoretical Exercises"
report from the 28th

140
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:45,692
of last month has
a similar scenario...

141
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,233
so please look it
over again carefully.

142
00:08:48,317 --> 00:08:49,608
You are the best trained

143
00:08:49,692 --> 00:08:52,233
and equipped fighting force
the world has to offer.

144
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,400
Complete this assignment
in your usual manner,

145
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:57,442
and I am sure you will be back
in time for lunch tomorrow.

146
00:08:57,525 --> 00:08:58,567
That is all for now.

147
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,942
Any questions?

148
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:02,608
Very well.

149
00:09:02,692 --> 00:09:04,442
Then please make your
preparations in accordance

150
00:09:04,525 --> 00:09:05,817
with S-O-P.

151
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:07,192
Best of luck.

152
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,442
Dismissed.

153
00:09:11,275 --> 00:09:12,358
That sounds good.

154
00:09:36,192 --> 00:09:38,650
Captain Brunowe will be
above Nanking shortly.

155
00:09:38,733 --> 00:09:40,275
Please fasten your safety belt.

156
00:09:40,358 --> 00:09:41,400
Sure.

157
00:10:01,233 --> 00:10:02,775
Everything's ready.

158
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:18,733
The specs for the
VRL-one-oh-eight unit have not

159
00:10:18,817 --> 00:10:20,608
been proven in this environment.

160
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:21,233
Commander.

161
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,358
Hold on.

162
00:10:22,442 --> 00:10:24,067
Don't change these settings.

163
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:25,733
Ask Sachs about the rest.

164
00:10:25,817 --> 00:10:27,150
Understood!

165
00:10:27,233 --> 00:10:30,025
Commander, may I use
an M9 on this mission?

166
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:31,317
Negative.

167
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,567
Is it absolutely necessary

168
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,400
to use the Arbalest
for this operation?

169
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:38,567
First off, can you give me a
reason why you SHOULDN'T use it,

170
00:10:38,650 --> 00:10:39,650
Sergeant?

171
00:10:40,817 --> 00:10:42,275
Well, I...

172
00:10:42,358 --> 00:10:44,025
Its performance
meets our standards.

173
00:10:44,108 --> 00:10:46,442
Objectively, there's
no reason not to.

174
00:10:46,525 --> 00:10:47,775
Sir.

175
00:10:47,858 --> 00:10:49,025
Also...

176
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:51,442
have you looked over the
last report I handed in?

177
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:52,733
About Wraith?

178
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:54,317
Yes, that one.

179
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:57,442
I fear that Chidori isn't
getting adequate protection

180
00:10:57,525 --> 00:11:00,025
from that
Intelligence bodyguard.

181
00:11:00,108 --> 00:11:01,317
It's like Wraith is...

182
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,983
just an observer?

183
00:11:03,067 --> 00:11:04,483
Exactly.

184
00:11:04,567 --> 00:11:06,692
The scope of our mission is
entirely different from that

185
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:08,108
of those in intelligence.

186
00:11:08,192 --> 00:11:09,108
But, sir!

187
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:10,775
We have our own
battles to fight.

188
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:13,358
Focus on the operation
ahead of you, sergeant.

189
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:14,692
Sir!

190
00:11:15,483 --> 00:11:17,025
This is the captain speaking.

191
00:11:17,108 --> 00:11:21,233
We will be surfacing momentarily
off the shore of Tontai.

192
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:24,400
Please begin final
preparations for deployment.

193
00:11:24,483 --> 00:11:25,650
Roger.

194
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,858
We'll be reaching
Lieutenant Bruno shortly.

195
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:30,192
A divided China, huh?

196
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:32,775
Exactly how long ago was
the civil war that split up

197
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,525
the nation?

198
00:11:34,608 --> 00:11:36,025
Eight years.

199
00:11:36,108 --> 00:11:38,775
And it's almost been five
since the armistice agreement.

200
00:11:39,733 --> 00:11:42,067
Yesterday's negotiations
in Nanking were supposed to

201
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,442
extend it.

202
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:45,900
At least watch the news!

203
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:47,983
So that's why
they were attacked...

204
00:11:48,067 --> 00:11:50,192
Talk about lousy security...

205
00:11:51,275 --> 00:11:55,067
It wasn't the security that was
abnormal,It was the attackers.

206
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:56,525
You've got that right.

207
00:11:56,608 --> 00:11:58,942
Not only that, but the
Cross-Yangtze River Tunnel

208
00:11:59,025 --> 00:12:01,483
is a neutral zone between
North and South China.

209
00:12:01,567 --> 00:12:03,983
That makes it a
political hotbed.

210
00:12:04,067 --> 00:12:06,400
One of the topics they were
gonna discuss at the summit

211
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:09,442
was the conflict over managing
and policing the tunnel.

212
00:12:09,525 --> 00:12:11,983
So, of course,
things got complicated...

213
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:13,525
Exactly.

214
00:12:13,608 --> 00:12:15,692
That's probably why we were
called in in the first place.

215
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:18,608
Moderates in both governments,
as well as the doves from

216
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:21,483
America and Russia who
happen to be backing them,

217
00:12:21,567 --> 00:12:24,192
must have "unofficially"
asked Mithril to stand by

218
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:25,483
just in case.

219
00:12:25,567 --> 00:12:27,358
If anything happens
to those hostages,

220
00:12:27,442 --> 00:12:29,858
it'll completely disrupt
the negotiations to extend

221
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:31,150
the agreement.

222
00:12:31,233 --> 00:12:32,983
It's been 5 years
since the ink dried,

223
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,233
and with both sides
finally stabilizing,

224
00:12:35,317 --> 00:12:37,567
something like that would
cause a lot of problems.

225
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:39,233
Now, wasn't that simple?

226
00:12:39,317 --> 00:12:40,025
Uh...

227
00:12:40,108 --> 00:12:40,817
NO!

228
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,025
It's quite simple.

229
00:12:42,108 --> 00:12:43,442
If our mission should fail,

230
00:12:43,525 --> 00:12:46,192
the risk of civil war breaking
out again will escalate.

231
00:12:46,275 --> 00:12:47,692
As simple as that.

232
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,692
Exactly, Sousuke.

233
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:51,983
Well, you coulda
said that before...

234
00:12:54,192 --> 00:12:56,150
You sure took long enough.

235
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,358
I'm Captain Bruno,
from Intelligence.

236
00:12:58,442 --> 00:13:00,358
I'm Sergeant Major Melissa Mao.

237
00:13:00,442 --> 00:13:01,567
Did you bring it?

238
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:02,442
Right here.

239
00:13:02,525 --> 00:13:04,067
I'll turn it over to you now.

240
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:08,400
You should know that normal
communications will be

241
00:13:08,483 --> 00:13:10,275
useless within the tunnel.

242
00:13:10,358 --> 00:13:12,650
That means that you will need
to deploy field repeaters

243
00:13:12,733 --> 00:13:14,567
in the appropriate locations.

244
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:15,650
What's the range?

245
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,150
Without obstructions,
500 meters.

246
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,567
But using them in the tunnels,

247
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:22,358
200 meters is about
all you're going to get.

248
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:25,067
So we have enough of them
to get the job done?

249
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:26,983
And will they reach
back to the Danaan?

250
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,275
Yes.

251
00:13:29,358 --> 00:13:31,358
I'll assume responsibility
for the entire system.

252
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,275
Just leave everything
in my hands.

253
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:34,192
Understood.

254
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,650
We're counting on you.

255
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:17,483
Urzu 2 to all units.

256
00:14:17,567 --> 00:14:20,358
Some brain donors started
the party without us.

257
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,233
Let's show them who's
playing the lead here!

258
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:23,317
Got it?

259
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,567
Roger.

260
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:27,442
This is Urzu 7.

261
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:28,692
Descent was successful.

262
00:14:28,775 --> 00:14:30,150
I'm in the tunnels.

263
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,317
And advancing rapidly on
Point oh--two--oh--two.

264
00:14:33,400 --> 00:14:34,567
Incoming AS.

265
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,567
11 o'clock.

266
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:36,400
Distance, 3.

267
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,567
Let's take him down.

268
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:38,608
Roger.

269
00:14:42,442 --> 00:14:43,775
It's begun, ma'am.

270
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:44,942
All right.

271
00:15:18,025 --> 00:15:19,067
This is Urzu 2.

272
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,442
Descent complete.

273
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:22,067
Destroyed one Savage.

274
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:24,858
Now proceeding to
Point oh--one--oh--four.

275
00:15:27,942 --> 00:15:29,108
This is Urzu 6.

276
00:15:29,192 --> 00:15:30,775
Descent successful.

277
00:15:30,858 --> 00:15:31,900
I just...

278
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:34,442
...disabled a Savage.

279
00:15:34,525 --> 00:15:35,858
Mopping him up now.

280
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:38,983
This is Team Ruby.

281
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,650
We've passed Point
oh--three--oh--seven.

282
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:41,817
No bogies spotted.

283
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:42,942
No casualties.

284
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:47,400
Now moving forward to Point
oh-three-oh-eight, on objective.

285
00:15:47,483 --> 00:15:49,900
Damn, this static is ridiculous.

286
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,150
Hey!

287
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:00,900
It's a booby trap!

288
00:16:09,608 --> 00:16:10,858
This is Urzu 7.

289
00:16:10,942 --> 00:16:13,108
I've neutralized
a second enemy AS unit.

290
00:16:13,192 --> 00:16:15,400
Now heading to Point
oh--two--oh--eight.

291
00:16:15,942 --> 00:16:18,192
Communication lines
malfunctioning due to

292
00:16:18,275 --> 00:16:20,025
multiple obstructions.

293
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:21,192
I know that.

294
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:23,983
Ogma 1, this is Urzu 7.

295
00:16:24,067 --> 00:16:25,400
Signal quality is poor.

296
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:27,025
Can you fix it?

297
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:28,525
This is Ogma 1.

298
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,108
The signal is satisfactory,

299
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:32,442
so there is no need
for improvement.

300
00:16:32,525 --> 00:16:34,442
But it may start to
hinder the operation!

301
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,567
If so, then I will make
the appropriate adjustments.

302
00:16:37,650 --> 00:16:38,858
Over and out.

303
00:16:41,483 --> 00:16:42,567
Warning.

304
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:44,733
Two 20--millimeter
sentry guns detected.

305
00:16:44,817 --> 00:16:46,067
Activate stealth mode.

306
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:47,067
ECS on.

307
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,108
Roger.

308
00:16:54,567 --> 00:16:55,567
Urzu 2 here.

309
00:16:55,650 --> 00:16:57,858
I've just passed
Point oh--two--fifteen.

310
00:16:57,942 --> 00:16:59,983
En route to cover
Ruby and Topaz.

311
00:17:01,192 --> 00:17:02,692
Urzu 6 here.

312
00:17:02,775 --> 00:17:05,400
Unable to destroy traps found
at Point oh--three--eighteen.

313
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,650
Heading to oh--two--eighteen.

314
00:17:07,733 --> 00:17:09,150
Urzu 7.

315
00:17:09,233 --> 00:17:12,483
Passed oh--two--oh--nine,
moving to point oh--two--ten.

316
00:17:13,483 --> 00:17:15,608
Enemy AS destruction
is progressing

317
00:17:15,692 --> 00:17:17,483
and they're moving
on the control room.

318
00:17:17,567 --> 00:17:18,192
Yes...

319
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,567
Something wrong?

320
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:23,608
Don't you think this
is going too smoothly?

321
00:17:25,442 --> 00:17:26,733
In fact I do,

322
00:17:26,817 --> 00:17:29,067
but that's not enough
reason for us to hold back.

323
00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:30,567
You're right...

324
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,442
Continue the operation.

325
00:17:33,525 --> 00:17:34,692
Ma'am.

326
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:45,608
What is this?

327
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:48,400
Let's see what we have here...

328
00:17:48,483 --> 00:17:51,275
Oh, it's the WHITE one!

329
00:17:51,358 --> 00:17:53,608
It's like a gleaming jewel!

330
00:17:53,692 --> 00:17:55,108
Well, if it weren't,

331
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:58,233
this wouldn't be a profitable
investment, would it, now?

332
00:17:58,317 --> 00:18:00,567
Yui Fang, get ready!

333
00:18:00,650 --> 00:18:02,150
Don't worry about me.

334
00:18:02,233 --> 00:18:04,608
Yui Lan, how are you
doing over there, sweetie?

335
00:18:04,692 --> 00:18:06,067
Not scared, are you?

336
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:07,150
Oops!

337
00:18:07,233 --> 00:18:08,567
Sorry, you can't
talk right now, can you?

338
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,275
Just keep calm, okay?

339
00:18:10,358 --> 00:18:12,567
My younger sister fears nothing.

340
00:18:14,025 --> 00:18:15,608
Guess she told me...

341
00:18:45,692 --> 00:18:46,942
Team Topaz here.

342
00:18:47,025 --> 00:18:48,567
We're in front of
the treasure chest now.

343
00:18:48,650 --> 00:18:49,733
Preparations complete.

344
00:18:49,817 --> 00:18:50,817
This is Team Ruby.

345
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:52,317
We're also in position.

346
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,108
Ready when you are Team Topaz.

347
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:56,025
This is strange.

348
00:18:56,108 --> 00:18:57,608
It's too quiet.

349
00:18:57,692 --> 00:19:00,442
But then, there aren't any
traps or anything like that.

350
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:06,817
Urzu 2 to Team Ruby
and Team Topaz.

351
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:08,483
Get ready to go in.

352
00:19:08,567 --> 00:19:09,817
On the count of three...

353
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:12,192
Two One Go!

354
00:19:30,067 --> 00:19:31,192
It's all clear.

355
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:32,775
Clear.

356
00:19:32,858 --> 00:19:34,150
Well, actually...

357
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,525
there are only hostages here.

358
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:36,650
No sign of the enemy.

359
00:19:36,733 --> 00:19:37,733
Any traps there?

360
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:38,942
Negative.

361
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:41,858
It seems perfectly safe,
but still...

362
00:19:41,942 --> 00:19:44,567
Hold your position;
I'm gonna come down there.

363
00:19:44,650 --> 00:19:46,400
Are you sure you want
to leave your machine?

364
00:19:46,483 --> 00:19:47,858
It should be fine now.

365
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:51,233
Friday has orders to attack
any AS units that don't

366
00:19:51,317 --> 00:19:53,192
respond to our IFF.

367
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:55,858
Topaz, you patrol the perimeter.

368
00:19:55,942 --> 00:19:57,692
Topaz, understood.

369
00:19:59,733 --> 00:20:00,858
It's about time.

370
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:03,067
Don't take this
personally, okay?

371
00:20:09,650 --> 00:20:11,192
Mike 2 destroyed.

372
00:20:11,275 --> 00:20:12,608
Search mode engaged.

373
00:20:12,692 --> 00:20:14,608
I just don't get it.

374
00:20:14,692 --> 00:20:15,775
Get what?

375
00:20:15,858 --> 00:20:17,483
They're not putting up
enough of a fight.

376
00:20:17,567 --> 00:20:19,567
I know they're just
old Savage models,

377
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:23,108
so you could say we've
got 'em overpowered, but...

378
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:24,692
Agreed.

379
00:20:24,775 --> 00:20:26,983
When you compare these AS units
to the kidnappers' maneuvers,

380
00:20:27,067 --> 00:20:28,942
this is just too simple.

381
00:20:29,025 --> 00:20:30,442
You thought so, too, Sousuke?

382
00:20:30,525 --> 00:20:31,733
Roger.

383
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:33,650
You still haven't spotted
any enemy artillery?

384
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:34,650
Yeah, that's right.

385
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:36,400
Something's rotten down here.

386
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:39,025
Once we're done looking
around, let's bug out quick.

387
00:20:39,108 --> 00:20:40,275
There you go.

388
00:20:40,358 --> 00:20:41,983
You're gonna be all right
in no time, miss.

389
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:46,483
It's not a chemical weapon
trap or anything like that...

390
00:20:46,567 --> 00:20:48,858
I mean, the air conditioning
is still working...

391
00:20:48,942 --> 00:20:51,483
Hey, this really is weird!

392
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:52,025
What?

393
00:20:52,108 --> 00:20:53,608
What's wrong?

394
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:57,192
There isn't anybody inside the
enemy AS unit I just destroyed.

395
00:20:57,275 --> 00:20:58,483
It's empty!

396
00:20:58,567 --> 00:21:00,942
Was it controlled
remotely or something?

397
00:21:01,025 --> 00:21:02,525
What the hell is going on?

398
00:21:09,942 --> 00:21:11,150
What did you say?

399
00:21:11,233 --> 00:21:13,025
Urzu 6, I didn't copy that...

400
00:21:13,108 --> 00:21:14,150
Say again!

401
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,775
What's going on with Kurz?

402
00:21:15,858 --> 00:21:16,942
Urzu 6!

403
00:21:37,108 --> 00:21:38,567
What's happening
out there, Ensign?

404
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:39,858
I don't know, ma'am.

405
00:21:39,942 --> 00:21:41,525
The communication line is bad,

406
00:21:41,608 --> 00:21:43,775
so I'm not getting
any response...

407
00:21:43,858 --> 00:21:46,108
Oh, wait - it looks
like we're getting...

408
00:21:46,192 --> 00:21:47,608
I've got a signal!

409
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,817
Urzu 7 to Headquarters.

410
00:21:49,900 --> 00:21:50,608
Do you read me?

411
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,067
Urzu 7 to Headquarters!

412
00:21:52,150 --> 00:21:52,858
Headquarters.

413
00:21:52,942 --> 00:21:54,942
What's your situation?

414
00:21:55,025 --> 00:21:57,650
The worst possible
scenario has happened.

415
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,483
It seems we've managed
to walk into a trap.

416
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:07,442
It's Venom.

417
00:22:10,775 --> 00:22:12,525
Hi there!

418
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:49,400
A perilous trap lying in wait.

419
00:23:49,483 --> 00:23:50,067
Venom.

420
00:23:50,150 --> 00:23:51,275
Shadow.

421
00:23:51,358 --> 00:23:53,317
Venomous fangs awaken
from their slumber.

422
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,733
We're cut off from escape,

423
00:23:54,817 --> 00:23:57,400
and the one shooting at us
is a ghost from the past.

424
00:23:57,483 --> 00:23:59,608
Next time: "Daylight."

425
00:23:59,692 --> 00:24:01,900
A dangerous ad-lib
begins in the darkness,

426
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,942
so we can live to
see daylight again.
