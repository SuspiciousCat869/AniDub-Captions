1
00:02:16,775 --> 00:02:17,942
Chidori

2
00:02:21,358 --> 00:02:22,775
Chidori is

3
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,108
She's dead.

4
00:03:01,233 --> 00:03:02,317
Sousuke.

5
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,942
Sorry, but we had to
follow you out here.

6
00:03:05,025 --> 00:03:06,608
Mao and the others
are fighting the Venom,

7
00:03:06,692 --> 00:03:09,233
without countermeasures
to the Lambda Driver.

8
00:03:09,317 --> 00:03:12,442
We just sent our
coordinates to the Danaan.

9
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:15,525
And they're going to be sending
the Arbalest out here shortly.

10
00:03:15,608 --> 00:03:17,317
We need you.

11
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:20,983
Come on!

12
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,900
You're the only guy
who can do this, man!

13
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,192
They don't stand
a chance out there!

14
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:26,942
She's dead.

15
00:03:27,942 --> 00:03:30,608
It's his damned curse.

16
00:03:30,692 --> 00:03:34,442
I let her die; then I kill him.

17
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:38,400
There's nothing left for me now.

18
00:03:38,483 --> 00:03:40,150
Kaname's dead?

19
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:44,733
I never had
a future to begin with.

20
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:46,733
Have fun killing yourselves.

21
00:03:46,817 --> 00:03:48,900
Die for all I care.

22
00:03:50,483 --> 00:03:52,317
In the end we're nothing.

23
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,233
just chunks of meat.

24
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,442
Have you lost your mind?

25
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:01,900
You sound just like
those terrorists!

26
00:04:03,317 --> 00:04:05,317
What, you don't realize that?

27
00:04:08,525 --> 00:04:10,483
Fine, then.

28
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:11,900
You wanna talk
like a terrorist?

29
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:14,400
Then I'm gonna
treat you like one.

30
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:15,817
Corporal, wait!

31
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,150
A soldier who's lost his soul
is nothing but a killer.

32
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:21,192
We can't just leave him here.

33
00:04:21,275 --> 00:04:23,358
You don't even
have a clue, do you?

34
00:04:23,442 --> 00:04:24,525
More than you do.

35
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:26,067
Is that right?

36
00:04:50,317 --> 00:04:51,733
Piece of shit.

37
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,775
It was useless
to send this thing.

38
00:04:56,858 --> 00:04:59,400
I can't even use it anyway.

39
00:04:59,483 --> 00:05:01,525
And I don't WANT to.

40
00:05:06,108 --> 00:05:06,983
That's right.

41
00:05:07,067 --> 00:05:09,567
Just lie there and rust away.

42
00:05:12,775 --> 00:05:14,400
So where are you going?

43
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,192
I said, "where
are you going?"

44
00:05:19,192 --> 00:05:20,150
Huh?

45
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,858
Don't have an answer for me?

46
00:05:21,942 --> 00:05:23,900
Chidori?

47
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:24,567
What?

48
00:05:24,650 --> 00:05:25,983
Cat got your tongue?

49
00:05:26,067 --> 00:05:28,692
Chidori you're alive?

50
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:33,650
What?

51
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,108
Is that all you have to say?

52
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:39,400
Ya know, I've been through hell
and back trying to get here!

53
00:05:39,483 --> 00:05:42,567
I was about to jump into your
arms all dramatic-like just

54
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:45,942
a second ago, and lucky me
what do I get instead?

55
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:47,317
And I quote.

56
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,192
"Chidori, you're alive."
THAT'S the best you can do?

57
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:52,317
You completely
ruined the moment!

58
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,942
So what are you going to do?

59
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:55,233
How are you

60
00:05:55,317 --> 00:05:57,192
going to take responsibility
for this, Sousuke?

61
00:05:57,275 --> 00:05:58,525
Now, wait, Chidori.

62
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,817
I don't understand
what you're talking.

63
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,983
SHUT UP!

64
00:06:01,567 --> 00:06:02,483
Does it hurt?

65
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:03,775
I hope so!

66
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:05,775
That's for the pain
you've caused to my heart!

67
00:06:05,858 --> 00:06:10,275
And THIS is for
the pain in my body!

68
00:06:10,358 --> 00:06:16,233
And this one's for
the PAIN IN MY SOUL!

69
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:22,733
It-It's a monster.

70
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:23,817
Wha'd you say?

71
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,775
What are you doing?

72
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:30,317
I'm taking you back with me,
Sergeant Dumb-ass!

73
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,400
I mean I almost get killed,
and you're nowhere around!

74
00:06:33,483 --> 00:06:36,567
And it actually made me
realize that... I mean,

75
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:47,775
I'm trying to tell you
that I... Um, that is, I...

76
00:06:47,858 --> 00:06:48,692
You what?

77
00:06:48,775 --> 00:06:53,817
I, uh, you see.

78
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,983
I mean.

79
00:07:06,358 --> 00:07:09,483
It's my responsibility
as class rep!

80
00:07:09,567 --> 00:07:10,942
Huh?

81
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:15,942
Looks like all my determination
petered out after only one day.

82
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,900
So, what did you want to say?

83
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,442
Never mind!

84
00:07:19,525 --> 00:07:22,150
This old guy named "Hunter"
or something told me that Mao

85
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,192
and the others
are fighting, right?

86
00:07:24,275 --> 00:07:26,608
So what in the world
are you doing HERE?

87
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:32,317
I just can't do it.

88
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,400
Why's that?

89
00:07:33,483 --> 00:07:36,900
'Cause I can't
operate my machine.

90
00:07:36,983 --> 00:07:38,608
And what's worse is...

91
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,567
I deserted YOU.

92
00:07:45,192 --> 00:07:46,983
And that's why
you're all depressed?

93
00:07:47,067 --> 00:07:48,400
I don't know.

94
00:07:48,483 --> 00:07:50,358
Is it really worth
throwing everything away?

95
00:07:50,442 --> 00:07:51,900
I just don't know!

96
00:07:51,983 --> 00:07:53,233
I understand.

97
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,442
You got worn out, right?

98
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,233
And then you
couldn't tell anyone.

99
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,858
And because you're so
self-conscious and hard-working

100
00:08:02,942 --> 00:08:04,317
you just reached your limit.

101
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,608
Am I right?

102
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:08,483
Well, I don't know

103
00:08:08,567 --> 00:08:09,775
Pathetic.

104
00:08:11,067 --> 00:08:12,108
Coward.

105
00:08:12,192 --> 00:08:13,692
Good-for-nothing.

106
00:08:16,525 --> 00:08:19,942
But you're strong,
and you're kind to people.

107
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:23,775
You still get things done
even though you're useless.

108
00:08:23,858 --> 00:08:26,400
At least that's the kind
of guy I thought you were.

109
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:27,733
Huh?

110
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,858
Weak people are parasites
who feed on the strong.

111
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:32,525
So am I?

112
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:36,150
Do you really like being around
a bunch of goddamn weaklings?

113
00:08:36,233 --> 00:08:37,983
So I'm useless?

114
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:41,025
Come on aren't you?

115
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:29,233
I'm sorry, Chidori.

116
00:09:29,317 --> 00:09:30,483
I...

117
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:32,150
What... what did I do?

118
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:33,025
Shut up!

119
00:09:33,108 --> 00:09:34,400
Everyone's in danger, right?!

120
00:09:34,483 --> 00:09:35,942
Not to mention.

121
00:09:36,025 --> 00:09:37,858
your CLASS CREDITS!

122
00:09:37,942 --> 00:09:39,608
Now MOVE your ass!

123
00:09:49,692 --> 00:09:51,233
Perth 1 to Urzu 1.

124
00:09:51,317 --> 00:09:53,192
Fall back three
blocks to the south.

125
00:09:53,275 --> 00:09:54,567
Try to lure him.

126
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:55,733
Roger.

127
00:09:55,817 --> 00:09:57,733
The enemy has to be
getting tired.

128
00:09:57,817 --> 00:09:59,817
You're better off if
you drag out the fight.

129
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,775
Provided we can hold out.

130
00:10:16,483 --> 00:10:17,733
Dammit!

131
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:24,775
That's quite enough of you

132
00:10:30,983 --> 00:10:33,608
Perth 1 this is Urzu 1.

133
00:10:33,692 --> 00:10:35,608
What is it, Urzu 1?

134
00:10:35,692 --> 00:10:37,025
We've got guests.

135
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:42,400
Five Venoms acquired.

136
00:10:46,358 --> 00:10:49,650
Well, it looks like we finally
caught up with you, kitten.

137
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:53,317
Going berserk in an unauthorized
theatre of operations.

138
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,692
What am I going to do with you?

139
00:10:55,775 --> 00:10:59,067
Remember, terrorist activity
without company approval

140
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,942
is a NO-NO!

141
00:11:02,025 --> 00:11:04,275
And what that means

142
00:11:04,358 --> 00:11:08,025
You, little girl, have
JUST PISSED DADDY OFF!

143
00:11:08,108 --> 00:11:09,442
Then I'm glad I did it.

144
00:11:09,525 --> 00:11:10,442
Huh?

145
00:11:10,525 --> 00:11:11,858
I know that Amalgam caused

146
00:11:11,942 --> 00:11:14,775
the civil war that
destroyed our hometown.

147
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,150
My sister and I will
have achieved our goal

148
00:11:18,233 --> 00:11:20,358
if we get revenge on you.

149
00:11:20,442 --> 00:11:21,233
Really?

150
00:11:21,317 --> 00:11:23,442
Your sister, you say?

151
00:11:23,525 --> 00:11:25,108
Oh yeah, that's right!

152
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:27,900
I forgot about
our special guest!

153
00:11:27,983 --> 00:11:31,108
HERE SHE IS!

154
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:38,150
Direct from a rooftop in the
middle of "Who-Gives-a-Damn"

155
00:11:38,233 --> 00:11:40,858
Japan, your little sister!

156
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:41,900
Ooooh!

157
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:43,858
Seems a little out
of sorts to me.

158
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:44,608
Hey!

159
00:11:44,692 --> 00:11:45,275
Yu Lan!

160
00:11:45,358 --> 00:11:46,525
Are you okay!

161
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,025
Say something!

162
00:11:48,108 --> 00:11:52,733
Oh, that big, strong, sexy
Mister Gates caught me Big Sis!

163
00:11:52,817 --> 00:11:54,025
It's so sad!

164
00:11:54,108 --> 00:11:56,358
But now I'm so happy

165
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:59,983
Yes, I'm so happy that we're
finally TOGETHER again!

166
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:01,150
Gosh.

167
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,650
All this brings
a fucking tear to my eye.

168
00:12:05,275 --> 00:12:07,567
Stop fighting, Big Sister!

169
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,525
Nothing good
ever comes from war!

170
00:12:10,608 --> 00:12:14,692
And after all, Mister Gates
has won my heart!

171
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:16,692
Oopsie!

172
00:12:16,775 --> 00:12:18,608
Goddamn thing broke.

173
00:12:18,692 --> 00:12:20,483
BASTARD!!!

174
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:42,192
You make this too easy, bitch!

175
00:12:47,192 --> 00:12:49,775
Say good niiiiiight!

176
00:13:01,317 --> 00:13:03,358
Ooh this is fun!

177
00:13:03,442 --> 00:13:05,192
Hey, you over there.

178
00:13:05,275 --> 00:13:07,775
You're one of those Mithril
assholes, aren't you?

179
00:13:07,858 --> 00:13:11,233
You know I didn't plan on
killing any of you today but

180
00:13:11,317 --> 00:13:11,983
Ehh!

181
00:13:12,067 --> 00:13:13,442
Shit happens.

182
00:13:13,525 --> 00:13:14,025
Ben!

183
00:13:14,108 --> 00:13:14,942
Get out!

184
00:13:15,025 --> 00:13:15,733
Stay away!

185
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:16,942
You won't make it in time!

186
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:19,608
So, my poor little
helpless sheep,

187
00:13:19,692 --> 00:13:22,775
are you done saying
your prayers yet?

188
00:13:22,858 --> 00:13:25,608
Because it's sleepy time!

189
00:13:32,817 --> 00:13:33,983
What was that?

190
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:35,900
Did YOU take that shot, Urzu 6?

191
00:13:35,983 --> 00:13:36,442
Nope.

192
00:13:36,525 --> 00:13:37,817
Wasn't me.

193
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,650
But it looks like HE finally
decided to grace us with

194
00:13:39,733 --> 00:13:41,608
his presence.

195
00:13:41,692 --> 00:13:44,275
He showed up right
in the nick of time!

196
00:13:44,358 --> 00:13:47,192
You were just waiting to make
a big entrance, weren'tcha?!

197
00:13:47,275 --> 00:13:48,608
Yeah, whatever.

198
00:13:56,733 --> 00:13:58,608
Uruz 7 to all units.

199
00:13:58,692 --> 00:14:00,567
Sorry about the wait.

200
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:02,692
Let me handle
the rest from here.

201
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,858
So, it's the Arbalest

202
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,400
We have activation, Al?

203
00:14:06,483 --> 00:14:07,483
Affirmative.

204
00:14:07,567 --> 00:14:10,025
Lambda Driver
activation confirmed.

205
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:11,858
Sometimes it works,
sometimes it doesn't.

206
00:14:11,942 --> 00:14:12,900
What a piece of junk.

207
00:14:12,983 --> 00:14:13,733
Agreed.

208
00:14:13,817 --> 00:14:15,150
Total garbage.

209
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:16,817
Oh, so now you're
getting cute on me.

210
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,858
Huh, funny guy?

211
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:18,692
Affirmative.

212
00:14:18,775 --> 00:14:20,192
You need new material.

213
00:14:20,817 --> 00:14:23,442
Urzu 7, are you all right?

214
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:24,483
Affirmative.

215
00:14:24,567 --> 00:14:25,567
Engage at will.

216
00:14:25,650 --> 00:14:26,858
Roger.

217
00:14:32,650 --> 00:14:34,192
Five Venoms, Al.

218
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,317
Normally, we should be
retreating at this point.

219
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,358
No, we can defeat them,
Sergeant.

220
00:14:38,442 --> 00:14:38,942
You're right!

221
00:14:39,025 --> 00:14:39,942
Let's go!

222
00:14:40,025 --> 00:14:40,983
Roger.

223
00:14:47,608 --> 00:14:48,858
Target the first machine.

224
00:15:00,525 --> 00:15:01,442
Scatter!

225
00:15:02,317 --> 00:15:03,900
You piece of shit!

226
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,817
Wha?

227
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:14,567
No way!

228
00:15:14,650 --> 00:15:15,983
That's impossible!

229
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:19,900
Two!

230
00:15:19,983 --> 00:15:21,192
Enemy inbound.

231
00:15:22,442 --> 00:15:25,025
You miserable piece of SHIT!

232
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:33,108
That makes three.

233
00:15:33,192 --> 00:15:34,525
Hey, that's my line!

234
00:15:37,775 --> 00:15:38,942
No!

235
00:15:55,150 --> 00:15:56,233
That's four!

236
00:16:03,608 --> 00:16:04,567
Damn!

237
00:16:10,817 --> 00:16:11,608
Back off!

238
00:16:11,692 --> 00:16:12,275
Back off!

239
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:12,900
Back off!

240
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,108
Back the fuck off!

241
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:17,358
I'll kill him
with one little slice!

242
00:16:17,442 --> 00:16:18,775
Don't move!

243
00:16:18,858 --> 00:16:19,650
Ben, NO!

244
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,275
What the hell is going on here?

245
00:16:21,358 --> 00:16:24,483
I thought Mithril's
Lambda Driver was unstable!

246
00:16:24,567 --> 00:16:27,150
So how can it be so strong?!

247
00:16:27,233 --> 00:16:28,692
You little shit

248
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:31,192
Who in the hell do
you think you are?

249
00:16:31,275 --> 00:16:32,108
Who, me?

250
00:16:32,192 --> 00:16:34,442
I'll tell you exactly who I am.

251
00:16:34,525 --> 00:16:37,317
I really couldn't
care less about Mithril.

252
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,317
I'm from Class 2-4 at Jindai
Tokyo Municipal High School.

253
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,317
Hey, now!

254
00:16:43,400 --> 00:16:45,525
I've still got a hostage here.

255
00:16:45,608 --> 00:16:47,483
I am student number 41

256
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:50,567
I'm in charge of waste
disposal and umbrellas.

257
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:52,650
Hell-OOOOOO!

258
00:16:52,733 --> 00:16:54,108
Shit!

259
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:03,942
I'm Sousuke Sagara!!!

260
00:17:16,317 --> 00:17:18,775
You know,
I could use a haircut.

261
00:18:00,442 --> 00:18:03,733
I know I told you to believe
in your own abilities and all.

262
00:18:03,817 --> 00:18:06,025
But that was overkill, Sergeant.

263
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:07,817
My apologies, Lieutenant.

264
00:18:10,650 --> 00:18:13,233
All hostile targets destroyed.

265
00:18:13,317 --> 00:18:15,358
Sergeant, I have a question.

266
00:18:15,442 --> 00:18:16,775
Go ahead.

267
00:18:16,858 --> 00:18:19,317
We just fought a battle
against all odds to a startling

268
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:21,317
and very decisive victory.

269
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,400
Could you please explain
the reason for our success?

270
00:18:24,483 --> 00:18:26,608
Well, I recently
solved a problem.

271
00:18:26,692 --> 00:18:28,275
I guess that must be it.

272
00:18:28,358 --> 00:18:29,900
A personal problem?

273
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:30,608
No.

274
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:32,483
More like OUR problem.

275
00:18:32,567 --> 00:18:34,275
I cannot comprehend
your response.

276
00:18:34,358 --> 00:18:36,483
It's something for you
to think about, then.

277
00:18:38,025 --> 00:18:40,025
Urzu 7 to all units.

278
00:18:40,108 --> 00:18:42,358
All Venoms have been destroyed.

279
00:18:42,442 --> 00:18:45,317
I will be returning to
the Tuatha de Danaan now.

280
00:18:49,442 --> 00:18:50,567
Correction.

281
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:53,483
Uruz 7 is now proceeding
to his next mission.

282
00:18:53,567 --> 00:18:54,858
I'm leaving the Arbalest here.

283
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:56,900
Retrieve it whenever you wish.

284
00:18:56,983 --> 00:18:59,567
But pick it up before
the local authorities do.

285
00:18:59,650 --> 00:19:00,817
"Next mission"?

286
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:03,192
What are you
talking about, Urzu 7?

287
00:19:03,275 --> 00:19:04,525
She's waiting for me.

288
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:05,525
That is all.

289
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:07,358
Urzu 7 out.

290
00:19:07,442 --> 00:19:08,608
Wait, Sagara!

291
00:19:08,692 --> 00:19:10,692
Are you going AWOL again?

292
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,525
All right, I'm confused.

293
00:19:14,608 --> 00:19:15,692
Whats his deal?

294
00:19:15,775 --> 00:19:18,358
Oh, it must be THAT.

295
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:21,192
Yeah, if it's THAT,
it must be okay

296
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:24,775
No one could have
predicted this.

297
00:19:24,858 --> 00:19:27,358
We can't afford to ignore
the Arbalest's potential.

298
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:32,567
Oh yes, she was
definitely a factor

299
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:36,150
Helping that soldier,
and that beautiful machine.

300
00:19:36,233 --> 00:19:39,192
Thank goodness we brought
this to a close without

301
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:41,817
destroying the entire
city of Hong Kong.

302
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,692
What about Sagara and Chidori?

303
00:19:43,775 --> 00:19:45,775
Looks like they
went back to Tokyo.

304
00:19:45,858 --> 00:19:46,733
Hmph.

305
00:19:46,817 --> 00:19:48,733
Disobeying orders again.

306
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:50,150
Well if that's true then

307
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,775
you disobeyed orders by
bringing her here, didn't you?

308
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:56,358
So I guess it's up to the
brass to make a decision then.

309
00:19:58,192 --> 00:19:59,358
I never would have expected you

310
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,692
to defy us in such
a threatening manner.

311
00:20:03,025 --> 00:20:06,358
Sergeant Sagara, I don't think
you quite understand how angry

312
00:20:06,442 --> 00:20:08,358
I am with you right now.

313
00:20:08,442 --> 00:20:09,817
But General Amit.

314
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:12,692
He is the only soldier
who can handle the Arbalest.

315
00:20:12,775 --> 00:20:14,275
At ease, Captain!

316
00:20:14,358 --> 00:20:15,608
I've already determined

317
00:20:15,692 --> 00:20:18,192
that this man's request
is completely out of line.

318
00:20:19,942 --> 00:20:21,608
General, Sir.

319
00:20:21,692 --> 00:20:23,108
I am only suggesting that

320
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:26,025
we make a change in the terms
of my enlistment contract.

321
00:20:26,108 --> 00:20:29,817
If this unsatisfactory to you I
will simply pay the penalty fee

322
00:20:29,900 --> 00:20:31,733
and give Mithril my resignation.

323
00:20:31,817 --> 00:20:34,983
How dare you say
such a thing, Sergeant.

324
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,817
Do you really think I'm going
to let you live a normal life

325
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:40,900
after you've made an enemy
of me and Mithril Intelligence?

326
00:20:40,983 --> 00:20:42,650
Let me ask you this.

327
00:20:42,733 --> 00:20:44,983
General, do you
really think that I haven't

328
00:20:45,067 --> 00:20:48,067
fully prepared myself
to do exactly that?

329
00:20:48,150 --> 00:20:49,358
What's that?!

330
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:51,275
Listen carefully, General.

331
00:20:54,108 --> 00:20:57,067
I don't remember agreeing
to sell my soul to Mithril.

332
00:20:57,150 --> 00:20:59,692
I have to continue
to do things my own way.

333
00:20:59,775 --> 00:21:01,067
That's all.

334
00:21:01,150 --> 00:21:03,483
I intend to keep on
piloting the Arbalest.

335
00:21:03,567 --> 00:21:07,108
I will keep on attending Jindai
High just like I have been.

336
00:21:07,192 --> 00:21:09,400
You can cut my pay
in half if you wish.

337
00:21:09,483 --> 00:21:10,900
Do you have a problem with that?

338
00:21:10,983 --> 00:21:13,067
Watch your tone
with me, Sergeant!

339
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:13,983
Sergeant?

340
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,692
I'm just a mercenary, sir.

341
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,525
Nothing but a soldier for hire.

342
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:20,817
I refuse to be ranked beneath
you as your lap dog, "General."

343
00:21:20,900 --> 00:21:22,150
You punk!

344
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:26,733
Lord Mallory, what?

345
00:21:26,817 --> 00:21:29,192
Looks like you've lost, General.

346
00:21:29,275 --> 00:21:32,442
This SRT member has
highly valuable skills

347
00:21:32,525 --> 00:21:35,900
and he has just offered
to work for half of his pay.

348
00:21:35,983 --> 00:21:38,692
You're out of
reasons to be angry.

349
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:40,983
Don't you gree gentlemen?

350
00:21:41,067 --> 00:21:43,108
Yes, I suppose so.

351
00:21:44,358 --> 00:21:46,733
But I'd rather not
let the cat out of the bag.

352
00:21:48,525 --> 00:21:50,483
Well then, is that all?

353
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,900
It looks like it's settled,
Captain Testarossa.

354
00:21:58,983 --> 00:22:00,233
I imagine it's difficult

355
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,400
having personalities like
these in your command?

356
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:03,442
Not really.

357
00:22:03,525 --> 00:22:05,650
My people are
the best out there.

358
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,608
And you, Sergeant

359
00:22:09,692 --> 00:22:12,692
Your name is
Sousuke Sagara, correct?

360
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,025
Sir!

361
00:22:14,108 --> 00:22:17,900
I will make sure
I remember your name.

362
00:22:17,983 --> 00:22:19,983
This meeting is done.

363
00:22:20,067 --> 00:22:23,025
Farewell and take care.

364
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,483
Sergeant, you had me
sweating bullets.

365
00:22:34,567 --> 00:22:36,983
You almost gave me a coronary.

366
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:37,692
Yes sir.

367
00:22:37,775 --> 00:22:39,233
I apologize for that.

368
00:22:39,317 --> 00:22:42,192
Honestly...

369
00:22:42,275 --> 00:22:43,275
Yes, sir.

370
00:22:43,358 --> 00:22:45,108
You're behaving
more like a man, now.

371
00:22:45,192 --> 00:22:46,192
Sir?

372
00:22:46,275 --> 00:22:48,525
I knew that you had it in you.

373
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:09,650
I still need to tell you...

374
00:23:09,733 --> 00:23:10,858
Ma'am?

375
00:23:10,942 --> 00:23:13,317
I'm sorry about
what I said before.

376
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,567
No.

377
00:23:14,650 --> 00:23:16,317
I should have apologized
to you for my conduct.

378
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,275
No, it's okay.

379
00:23:18,358 --> 00:23:20,233
I wasn't very dignified.

380
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,733
I guess I behaved like
a spoiled brat back then.

381
00:23:25,775 --> 00:23:26,858
But...

382
00:23:29,483 --> 00:23:30,775
Anyway...

383
00:23:32,275 --> 00:23:38,233
I was wondering are we,
are you and I still friends?

384
00:23:38,317 --> 00:23:39,442
Friends, Ma'am?

385
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,025
Well, Captain.

386
00:23:51,108 --> 00:23:52,567
Sergeant?

387
00:23:52,650 --> 00:23:54,942
If you really do acknowledge me
as a friend, Madame Captain,

388
00:23:55,025 --> 00:23:56,525
would it be possible
for you to forgive me

389
00:23:56,608 --> 00:23:59,400
for making a blunt remark?

390
00:23:59,483 --> 00:24:00,983
Go ahead

391
00:24:06,067 --> 00:24:09,775
Tessa, I'm really sorry.

392
00:24:09,858 --> 00:24:11,858
You are an incredible person.

393
00:24:11,942 --> 00:24:16,400
To me, you are not just
a superior officer. I...

394
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:19,650
to me you're more
important than that.

395
00:24:19,733 --> 00:24:23,358
And, if something ever
happens I'll be there for you

396
00:24:23,442 --> 00:24:25,275
Please remember that

397
00:24:27,317 --> 00:24:28,692
Forgive me, I'm sorry
about that, okay?

398
00:24:28,775 --> 00:24:30,025
It was impertinent,

399
00:24:30,108 --> 00:24:31,650
but that's how I really
feel and I had to say so!

400
00:24:31,733 --> 00:24:33,108
Well I'm going now...!

401
00:24:39,442 --> 00:24:44,025
Tessa Tessa He called
me "Tessa!" Oh my gosh!

402
00:24:44,108 --> 00:24:44,775
Oh my gosh!

403
00:24:44,858 --> 00:24:46,025
What do I do now?!

404
00:24:46,108 --> 00:24:48,275
He thinks I'm IMPORTANT!

405
00:24:55,775 --> 00:24:59,942
Seriously If you even think of
doing something like this again,

406
00:25:00,025 --> 00:25:02,233
I'm not going to be
able to cover for you.

407
00:25:02,317 --> 00:25:03,025
Ma'am!

408
00:25:03,108 --> 00:25:04,275
I'm grateful.

409
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:06,108
Honestly It's a good thing

410
00:25:06,192 --> 00:25:08,567
I decided to keep
that letter in my desk.

411
00:25:08,650 --> 00:25:11,567
And don't think I've forgotten
about that incident with my car.

412
00:25:11,650 --> 00:25:12,900
I don't...

413
00:25:12,983 --> 00:25:13,733
Mr. Sagara!

414
00:25:13,817 --> 00:25:14,567
What are you doing?!!!

415
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:15,650
You're in danger!

416
00:25:15,733 --> 00:25:17,025
There's a laser sight
targeting you!!!

417
00:25:17,108 --> 00:25:18,650
What in the world
are you talking about?

418
00:25:18,733 --> 00:25:19,483
Hey!

419
00:25:19,567 --> 00:25:21,233
What are you doing Sousuke?!

420
00:25:21,317 --> 00:25:21,942
Take cover!

421
00:25:22,025 --> 00:25:23,067
We're under attack!

422
00:25:25,317 --> 00:25:26,775
Serves you right.

423
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:29,525
I'm the one doing surveillance
out here in the cold.

424
00:25:29,608 --> 00:25:31,942
So you can entertain me.

425
00:25:35,942 --> 00:25:37,733
Looks like it's going
to be a lovely winter.

426
00:25:37,817 --> 00:25:38,608
I can't believe

427
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:40,442
you're already causing trouble!

428
00:25:40,525 --> 00:25:43,483
I don't even think
you're taking this seriously!

429
00:25:43,567 --> 00:25:44,358
But Chidori, I...

430
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:45,525
Quiet, you!

431
00:25:45,608 --> 00:25:47,983
You haven't made any
progress whatsoever!

432
00:25:48,067 --> 00:25:50,608
And you're always,
always, always, always

433
00:25:50,692 --> 00:26:00,692
Always, always, always, always
Always, always, always...

434
00:26:00,775 --> 00:26:07,525
So it's like things
haven't changed at all.

435
00:26:07,608 --> 00:26:08,900
Chidori?

436
00:26:11,858 --> 00:26:16,358
How could you just run away
and leave me here like that

437
00:26:16,442 --> 00:26:19,233
What were you thinking?

438
00:26:19,317 --> 00:26:21,692
I'll never forgive you for that.

439
00:26:21,775 --> 00:26:23,983
Sorry.

440
00:26:24,067 --> 00:26:26,192
"Sorry" isn't going to cut it.

441
00:26:26,275 --> 00:26:27,567
You.

442
00:26:27,650 --> 00:26:29,067
Stupid.

443
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:30,608
Jerk!

444
00:26:34,858 --> 00:26:36,567
I was frightened!

445
00:26:38,317 --> 00:26:40,983
I was so scared,
because you weren't there!

446
00:26:42,733 --> 00:26:45,733
Don't ever do anything
like that again!

447
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:48,608
You idiot!

448
00:26:52,108 --> 00:26:56,400
Because I won't
forgive you next time.

449
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,650
Huh?

450
00:27:11,733 --> 00:27:13,567
Kaname and Sousuke?

451
00:27:13,650 --> 00:27:16,650
What are the two of you
doing all alone out here?

452
00:27:16,733 --> 00:27:18,442
We weren't really
doing anything, Kyoko

453
00:27:18,525 --> 00:27:21,733
Oh no, he didn't make
you cry, did he?

454
00:27:21,817 --> 00:27:24,525
Oh you know Sousuke

455
00:27:24,608 --> 00:27:25,983
Sousuke!

456
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:27,442
Did you think a terrorist
was after her and knock her

457
00:27:27,525 --> 00:27:28,900
on the floor again?!

458
00:27:28,983 --> 00:27:29,525
What?

459
00:27:29,608 --> 00:27:30,900
That's not it

460
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:32,400
It's not very manly to
make excuses, you big jerk!

461
00:27:32,483 --> 00:27:32,775
Yeah!

462
00:27:32,858 --> 00:27:33,567
Yeah!

463
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,775
Say you're sorry, lame-o!

464
00:27:34,858 --> 00:27:35,983
It's not like that at all.

465
00:27:36,067 --> 00:27:37,358
OH YEAH?!

466
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:44,983
I'll just give up.

467
00:27:45,067 --> 00:27:45,483
What?

468
00:27:45,567 --> 00:27:46,150
Nothing.

469
00:27:46,233 --> 00:27:47,317
it's not a problem.

470
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:48,400
And just what do
you mean by THAT, Sousuke?

471
00:27:48,483 --> 00:27:49,608
Huh?

472
00:27:49,692 --> 00:27:51,025
Where do you get off
treating her like that?!

473
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:51,900
You think you're gonna
get away with making her cry,

474
00:27:51,983 --> 00:27:54,275
you better think again, mister!

475
00:27:54,358 --> 00:27:59,275
I can't believe you'd be
so insensitive, Sousuke.

476
00:27:59,358 --> 00:28:01,692
Gosh, you're such a jerk!

477
00:28:01,775 --> 00:28:02,733
What's wrong with you?

478
00:29:52,983 --> 00:29:53,983
I just remembered.

479
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:55,442
Hm?

480
00:29:55,525 --> 00:29:57,275
You were trying to tell me
something back in Hong Kong,

481
00:29:57,358 --> 00:29:58,067
right?

482
00:29:58,150 --> 00:29:59,733
What exactly was it?

483
00:29:59,817 --> 00:30:02,150
Well, it was just...

484
00:30:17,108 --> 00:30:18,192
it was nothing.

485
00:30:18,275 --> 00:30:19,942
Oh... I see.
