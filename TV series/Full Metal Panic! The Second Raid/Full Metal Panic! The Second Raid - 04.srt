1
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:00,817
Yeah, that's right.

2
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:02,442
Something's rotten down here.

3
00:02:02,525 --> 00:02:05,067
Once we're done looking
around, let's bug out quick.

4
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:06,358
There you go.

5
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:08,108
You're going to be
all right in no time, miss.

6
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:13,233
There isn't anybody inside the
enemy AS unit I just destroyed.

7
00:02:13,317 --> 00:02:15,775
Was it controlled
remotely or something?

8
00:02:15,858 --> 00:02:17,442
What the hell is going on?

9
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:35,900
It seems we've managed
to walk into a trap.

10
00:02:47,233 --> 00:02:49,608
He said they walked into a trap

11
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:51,900
Bring up the ADM
data on the monitor.

12
00:02:51,983 --> 00:02:53,233
Yes, Captain.

13
00:02:57,692 --> 00:02:59,317
They're spread out all over.

14
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,108
Literally too busy
fighting to call in.

15
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:04,192
They have spotty communications.

16
00:03:04,275 --> 00:03:06,817
So their data links aren't
going to work well either.

17
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,150
It's looking bad.

18
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:10,233
At this rate,
Melissa and the others will...

19
00:03:32,858 --> 00:03:34,442
Stop struggling, please.

20
00:03:34,525 --> 00:03:35,650
A kid?

21
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:38,483
Resisting will only
make this more painful.

22
00:03:48,567 --> 00:03:49,692
No way!

23
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:56,233
There's not enough room!

24
00:04:08,192 --> 00:04:09,400
Is it HIM?

25
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:10,983
There's no way it could be.

26
00:04:12,067 --> 00:04:13,525
I thought he was...

27
00:04:15,067 --> 00:04:16,317
dead.

28
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,192
Hold still, now!

29
00:04:18,275 --> 00:04:19,442
Or my bullets...

30
00:04:19,525 --> 00:04:21,275
just might miss you!

31
00:04:29,025 --> 00:04:30,275
DAMN!

32
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:35,400
It can't be him.

33
00:04:42,858 --> 00:04:44,233
Did I get him?

34
00:04:50,858 --> 00:04:52,817
So it has a Lambda Driver.

35
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,275
That was a close one!

36
00:04:56,358 --> 00:04:59,150
Barely missed me by the hair
of my chinny-chin-chin,

37
00:04:59,233 --> 00:05:00,358
didn'tcha?

38
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:01,942
Hey it's me.

39
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:04,442
Any changes in the
enemy situation?

40
00:05:04,525 --> 00:05:05,400
Negative.

41
00:05:05,483 --> 00:05:06,817
They're still confused.

42
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:07,608
Perfect!

43
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:09,108
Continue the interference.

44
00:05:10,358 --> 00:05:12,067
WE'LL KILL THEM ALL!

45
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:18,942
All units this is Urzu 7...

46
00:05:19,025 --> 00:05:21,733
I am engaging an enemy
AS at oh-two-eleven.

47
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:23,775
The enemy unit is a Venom type.

48
00:05:24,525 --> 00:05:26,858
I will try drawing him
to oh-one-twelve.

49
00:05:26,942 --> 00:05:28,192
Are there any available units

50
00:05:28,275 --> 00:05:30,775
that can come in from the
East to help box him in?

51
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,400
HQ to Urzu 7.

52
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:33,983
Your coordinates are incorrect.

53
00:05:34,067 --> 00:05:34,983
Please confirm.

54
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:37,108
Current position
is oh-two-eleven.

55
00:05:37,192 --> 00:05:38,483
Hurry and send response...

56
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:40,483
Give me accurate
coordinates, Urzu 7!

57
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:42,275
This is Urzu 7 to HQ.

58
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:43,400
Do you read me?

59
00:05:43,483 --> 00:05:45,608
Trying to proceed
to oh-one-twelve...

60
00:05:45,692 --> 00:05:47,192
Repeat, trying...

61
00:05:47,275 --> 00:05:48,608
Do you read me, Urzu 7?

62
00:05:48,692 --> 00:05:49,858
This is Urzu 6.

63
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:52,150
I am currently
engaging an enemy AS.

64
00:05:52,233 --> 00:05:53,900
It's a combat Shadow type.

65
00:05:53,983 --> 00:05:56,150
I'm gonna try to divert him
to oh-three-fifteen

66
00:05:56,233 --> 00:05:58,192
and crush his ass.

67
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:01,025
Urzu 6, can you confirm
Urzu 7 at oh-two-sixteen?

68
00:06:01,108 --> 00:06:02,275
Urzu 6?

69
00:06:02,358 --> 00:06:04,817
What the hell is wrong
with the com devices?

70
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,942
It means the plan is working.

71
00:06:08,025 --> 00:06:11,483
If you guys recover now,
it'll be bad for my business.

72
00:06:11,567 --> 00:06:13,733
And we can't have that, can we?

73
00:06:13,817 --> 00:06:15,108
Wha...?

74
00:06:15,192 --> 00:06:17,317
A complaint from the boss.

75
00:06:20,567 --> 00:06:21,567
Ogma 1 here.

76
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,775
This is the Captain.

77
00:06:22,858 --> 00:06:24,775
The local data link
is completely disrupted.

78
00:06:24,858 --> 00:06:26,608
Explain this!

79
00:06:26,692 --> 00:06:29,025
I believe it's due to the
complex structure of the tunnel,

80
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:30,400
Captain.

81
00:06:30,483 --> 00:06:32,983
Leakage and fires are
producing unexpected amounts

82
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,067
of interference...

83
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:36,233
Make improving it
your top priority.

84
00:06:36,317 --> 00:06:37,442
Yes, ma'am.

85
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,692
ADM data is unreliable now.

86
00:06:41,775 --> 00:06:43,817
I'm changing the
battle control method.

87
00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:45,650
To manual?

88
00:06:45,733 --> 00:06:47,983
Correct, with voice and paper.

89
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:54,817
I have to grasp the situation
as quickly as possible.

90
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,442
Or they'll all die.

91
00:07:16,483 --> 00:07:18,025
I told you.

92
00:07:18,108 --> 00:07:20,358
It'll only hurt you more.

93
00:07:22,817 --> 00:07:24,275
Just a child...

94
00:07:24,358 --> 00:07:29,150
But she seems devoid of
all emotion, except...

95
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,400
total despair.

96
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:33,983
Mao!

97
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:35,067
Fire!

98
00:07:56,233 --> 00:07:57,108
She got away.

99
00:07:57,192 --> 00:07:58,192
Should we go after her?

100
00:07:58,275 --> 00:07:59,442
No.

101
00:07:59,525 --> 00:08:01,067
Our first priority is
to get the hostages out,

102
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:02,775
and make sure they're
not booby-trapped.

103
00:08:02,858 --> 00:08:04,192
Who the hell was that girl?

104
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:05,608
A "sleeping terrorist."

105
00:08:05,692 --> 00:08:08,150
She was planted with
the rest of the hostages.

106
00:08:08,233 --> 00:08:09,733
But what purpose
does that serve?

107
00:08:09,817 --> 00:08:11,108
Who knows?

108
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:12,942
After all, she could've
easily killed us all by now

109
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:15,025
with just a couple
of one-pound bombs.

110
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:17,275
So she was planning on
doing something else...

111
00:08:17,358 --> 00:08:19,483
They may have been testing us.

112
00:08:19,567 --> 00:08:22,983
It feels like we're just a bunch
of flies caught in a spider web.

113
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,067
Damn!

114
00:08:32,983 --> 00:08:34,150
And the bodies?

115
00:08:34,233 --> 00:08:36,025
Looks like we're gonna
have to leave them here.

116
00:08:36,108 --> 00:08:37,150
Understood.

117
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:40,275
This is Urzu 2 to all units.

118
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,483
Team Ruby has suffered
casualties in an enemy attack.

119
00:08:43,567 --> 00:08:44,983
Three fatalities.

120
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:47,275
Urzu 2 and Team Topaz
are moving the hostages

121
00:08:47,358 --> 00:08:49,067
to oh-two-sixteen.

122
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:07,483
Three fatalities?

123
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,400
Transmitting to protocol...

124
00:09:09,483 --> 00:09:11,733
Performing cryptanalysis...

125
00:09:23,150 --> 00:09:26,858
At this rate,
I'll be number four!

126
00:09:26,942 --> 00:09:29,900
I'm engaging three units
at oh-two-sixteen.

127
00:09:29,983 --> 00:09:31,358
I need you to
direct me out of here

128
00:09:31,442 --> 00:09:33,400
before they get ahead of me!

129
00:09:33,483 --> 00:09:37,275
Urzu 6, keep moving ahead and
move to oh-three-sixteen,

130
00:09:37,358 --> 00:09:39,233
there shouldn't be
any enemies there.

131
00:09:39,317 --> 00:09:41,400
That's where I came from!

132
00:09:41,483 --> 00:09:44,025
Understood, then proceed
to oh-one-fourteen.

133
00:09:44,108 --> 00:09:44,900
Roger.

134
00:09:44,983 --> 00:09:46,942
I'm counting on you, Commander!

135
00:09:47,025 --> 00:09:49,317
Urzu 2 to headquarters.

136
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:52,108
Current position
is oh-two-fifteen.

137
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:54,983
I'm about to lead the hostages
toward oh-three-fourteen.

138
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,817
There shouldn't be any
enemies there, right?

139
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:57,942
Affirmative.

140
00:09:58,025 --> 00:09:59,025
But be cautious.

141
00:09:59,108 --> 00:10:00,108
There are...

142
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:02,650
Oh, shit!

143
00:10:02,733 --> 00:10:04,317
Fall back!

144
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,650
Urzu 2 to Headquarters.

145
00:10:05,733 --> 00:10:06,942
I can't escort a damn thing

146
00:10:07,025 --> 00:10:09,108
with the enemies always
one step ahead of us!

147
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:10,942
I'll send them with Team Topaz.

148
00:10:11,025 --> 00:10:12,942
Requesting coordinates!

149
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,150
Urzu 2, did the enemies

150
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:16,525
come from the direction
of oh-three-fifteen?

151
00:10:16,608 --> 00:10:17,733
Affirmative.

152
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:18,942
Understood.

153
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:20,608
Slowly fall back in
the opposite direction.

154
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,483
Urzu 2, Roger.

155
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,483
Something's wrong.

156
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,067
It doesn't make sense.

157
00:10:25,150 --> 00:10:25,983
Ma'am?

158
00:10:26,067 --> 00:10:27,567
The enemy anticipates...

159
00:10:27,650 --> 00:10:29,733
every single move we're making.

160
00:10:29,817 --> 00:10:30,567
But...

161
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,067
it should be impossible for

162
00:10:32,150 --> 00:10:34,733
the enemy to intercept our
communications, shouldn't it?

163
00:10:34,817 --> 00:10:37,275
Technologically speaking, yes.

164
00:10:37,358 --> 00:10:38,900
HQ, do you read me?

165
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,983
I gotta pull a Houdini here,
or they're gonna smoke me!

166
00:10:41,067 --> 00:10:41,858
All right...

167
00:10:41,942 --> 00:10:43,650
How, then?

168
00:10:43,733 --> 00:10:44,817
You heard that, right?

169
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,275
Urzu 2 gave up on
leading the hostages.

170
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,692
They say they'll
slowly fall back.

171
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,400
And another thing...

172
00:10:51,483 --> 00:10:55,483
Urzu 7 reported he's
moving to oh-three-twelve.

173
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:58,650
Urzu 7, huh?

174
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:01,483
That machine's name
is "Arbalest," right?

175
00:11:03,442 --> 00:11:06,442
Quit your fighting -
and just come to daddy!

176
00:11:19,025 --> 00:11:20,775
What do I do with them now?

177
00:11:20,858 --> 00:11:23,983
I messed around with them
a little, just like you asked.

178
00:11:24,067 --> 00:11:26,858
I can go ahead and kill
all of them, if you want.

179
00:11:26,942 --> 00:11:28,108
Leave 'em alone.

180
00:11:28,192 --> 00:11:30,817
More importantly, how
were those Mithril guys?

181
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,775
I guess...

182
00:11:31,858 --> 00:11:33,150
their skills are fairly good,

183
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,067
but they're way
too soft to survive.

184
00:11:36,150 --> 00:11:37,775
How many did you kill?

185
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:39,358
Only three men.

186
00:11:39,442 --> 00:11:42,608
One diehard woman soldier got
away before I could finish her.

187
00:11:42,692 --> 00:11:44,108
Oh?

188
00:11:44,192 --> 00:11:45,817
Can I just go home now?

189
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,608
I've got blood all over me...

190
00:11:48,733 --> 00:11:50,942
...and I could
really use a shower.

191
00:12:12,192 --> 00:12:13,150
Urzu 7 here.

192
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,900
Enemy units just passed me.

193
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:16,525
Current position
is oh-three-twelve,

194
00:12:16,608 --> 00:12:18,858
and I'm en route
to assist Urzu 2.

195
00:12:27,108 --> 00:12:29,442
Cancel that--I've been
spotted by enemy units!

196
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,275
I don't get it--
how do they know?

197
00:12:31,358 --> 00:12:32,483
This is Urzu 6.

198
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,942
Another ambush!

199
00:12:34,025 --> 00:12:36,358
There's no way
I can take much more...

200
00:12:36,442 --> 00:12:37,608
Urzu 9 to HQ.

201
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:40,108
The enemy is blocking
our escape route, too!

202
00:12:41,358 --> 00:12:43,317
We're all gonna die
if this keeps up!

203
00:12:44,358 --> 00:12:45,650
What the hell's going on?!

204
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:46,942
Don't waste your time!

205
00:12:47,025 --> 00:12:48,650
Running is useless!

206
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:51,525
We put in a lot of overtime
getting ready for this day,

207
00:12:51,608 --> 00:12:52,817
Mithril!

208
00:12:54,525 --> 00:12:55,817
There's no doubt.

209
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:57,983
We have an information leak.

210
00:12:58,067 --> 00:12:59,233
I agree.

211
00:12:59,317 --> 00:13:00,275
Well then...

212
00:13:00,358 --> 00:13:01,858
what are we
going to do about it?

213
00:13:01,942 --> 00:13:04,358
If we can't direct them, they
won't be able to fight, move,

214
00:13:04,442 --> 00:13:05,942
OR communicate effectively.

215
00:13:06,025 --> 00:13:07,400
I'm aware of that.

216
00:13:09,025 --> 00:13:12,608
In this case, we must abandon
"command and control" protocol.

217
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,817
Abandon it?

218
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:16,608
You can't possibly mean

219
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:18,942
we're simply going
to leave it all up to them?

220
00:13:19,025 --> 00:13:21,108
No, we're turning
the tables on them.

221
00:13:21,192 --> 00:13:23,650
Commander, do you remember
the conversation we had

222
00:13:23,733 --> 00:13:25,108
during the briefing?

223
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:25,983
Yes, ma'am.

224
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,900
I hope everyone remembers it...

225
00:13:29,025 --> 00:13:30,483
This'll be a gamble.

226
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:34,192
Dammit!

227
00:13:34,275 --> 00:13:35,817
Where the hell
are we supposed to go?

228
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:38,983
Headquarters ordered us
to go right, but...

229
00:13:39,067 --> 00:13:40,650
Headquarters to all units.

230
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:43,067
This is a top priority order.

231
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:46,358
Does everyone remember Tony's
joke during the briefing?

232
00:13:47,942 --> 00:13:48,942
Tony's joke?

233
00:13:49,025 --> 00:13:50,525
Exactly, when I told you
that we should

234
00:13:50,608 --> 00:13:53,025
"save the lecture for later."
We'll be using that method.

235
00:13:53,108 --> 00:13:54,317
Lecture?

236
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,733
You mean...

237
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:58,275
Yeah it's just like
the Cretans' paradox.

238
00:13:58,358 --> 00:13:59,317
What is that?

239
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:00,983
It's the paradox
when a Cretan says,

240
00:14:01,067 --> 00:14:02,692
"All Cretans are liars."

241
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,275
That's what he's saying...

242
00:14:04,358 --> 00:14:08,025
Okay, let's just use our
heads and stay focused.

243
00:14:08,108 --> 00:14:09,775
What does that mean?

244
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:16,025
Don't worry--doesn't matter.

245
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:17,692
I'm still tuned
into their chatter,

246
00:14:17,775 --> 00:14:20,400
so then I guess they're
still shit outta luck.

247
00:14:22,858 --> 00:14:24,650
Now then, tell Urzu 9...

248
00:14:24,733 --> 00:14:27,733
to move carefully to the
left at that T intersection.

249
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:28,400
Move right.

250
00:14:28,483 --> 00:14:29,108
And hurry.

251
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:29,733
Got it?

252
00:14:29,817 --> 00:14:31,192
Urzu 9, copy that.

253
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:32,650
We're moving.

254
00:14:32,733 --> 00:14:33,692
Let's go.

255
00:14:34,983 --> 00:14:35,608
H-Hey!

256
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:36,400
That's the wrong...

257
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:37,317
Don't worry.

258
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:38,483
This is it.

259
00:14:38,567 --> 00:14:40,483
Have Urzu 2 move
to oh-one-twelve,

260
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,108
to draw out the enemy.

261
00:14:42,192 --> 00:14:44,692
Urzu 2, go to
oh-one-one-oh.

262
00:14:44,775 --> 00:14:46,358
Engage all enemies!

263
00:14:46,442 --> 00:14:48,400
Roger, I'm on the way, sir!

264
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,942
Have Urzu 6 hold his position,

265
00:14:54,025 --> 00:14:56,817
and fend off as many
enemies as possible.

266
00:14:56,900 --> 00:14:59,317
Avoid all further
engagements, Urzu 6...

267
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,692
Disengage.

268
00:15:03,358 --> 00:15:04,900
Urzu 6, Roger!

269
00:15:08,692 --> 00:15:11,275
Urzu 9 needs to get
further down that tunnel.

270
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:13,400
Urzu 9, stop your advance.

271
00:15:13,483 --> 00:15:14,358
Hurry!

272
00:15:14,442 --> 00:15:15,775
Keep those feet moving!

273
00:15:15,858 --> 00:15:16,775
Roger!

274
00:15:16,858 --> 00:15:19,025
Urzu 2, moving to
oh-three-twelve.

275
00:15:19,108 --> 00:15:22,900
Urzu 6, stand fast and
avoid contact with the enemy.

276
00:15:22,983 --> 00:15:24,108
Got it.

277
00:15:24,192 --> 00:15:26,358
Create a diversion,
and lure the enemy...

278
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:28,900
Aw, crap...!

279
00:15:28,983 --> 00:15:31,942
Urzu 9, advance forward
toward oh-three.

280
00:15:32,025 --> 00:15:32,858
Roger.

281
00:15:34,192 --> 00:15:37,317
Urzu 7, double back
and avoid Route 2.

282
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,858
Then proceed to
Point oh-four-fifteen.

283
00:15:39,942 --> 00:15:41,858
Urzu 7, Roger.

284
00:15:41,942 --> 00:15:44,400
Madam Captain,
the enemy is targeting...

285
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:45,192
Yes.

286
00:15:45,275 --> 00:15:46,692
The Arbalest.

287
00:15:52,733 --> 00:15:53,567
Yui Fang?

288
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:54,442
What?

289
00:15:54,525 --> 00:15:55,983
I am a little busy right now...

290
00:15:56,067 --> 00:15:58,108
That small fry
still giving you trouble?

291
00:15:58,192 --> 00:16:00,275
It's time for us
to finish our shopping!

292
00:16:00,358 --> 00:16:02,608
Waste him and bring back
what you came for!

293
00:16:15,275 --> 00:16:16,358
This is 103.

294
00:16:16,442 --> 00:16:18,317
I'm standing by
at the given point.

295
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,192
And I still haven't made
contact with the enemy yet!

296
00:16:21,275 --> 00:16:22,275
Same story here.

297
00:16:22,358 --> 00:16:22,983
No one's coming.

298
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:24,233
What's going on?

299
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,817
Stop your whining, goddammit!

300
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,358
Just do as you're ordered.

301
00:16:28,442 --> 00:16:31,858
We're reading every one of their
moves, so just stay calm...

302
00:16:31,942 --> 00:16:34,942
and wait patiently for
your prey to show up!

303
00:16:35,025 --> 00:16:37,900
Urzu 6, escape to
the northeast from there.

304
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:40,317
You have permission to
engage the enemy at will.

305
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,650
Urzu 6, roger.

306
00:16:42,733 --> 00:16:44,650
Urzu 2, hold your position.

307
00:16:44,733 --> 00:16:46,733
You are forbidden to move
toward oh-four-oh-five!

308
00:16:46,817 --> 00:16:48,108
Okay, what's going on...

309
00:16:48,192 --> 00:16:49,567
Urzu 2, Roger.

310
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:50,942
Urzu 9, have you...

311
00:16:51,025 --> 00:16:53,233
It just doesn't make any sense.

312
00:16:53,317 --> 00:16:54,150
Have they...

313
00:16:54,233 --> 00:16:55,692
figured out what we're doing?

314
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:59,525
Giving contrary orders
'cause they're on to us?

315
00:16:59,608 --> 00:17:00,692
Impossible.

316
00:17:00,775 --> 00:17:02,942
There's no way they
could pull that off.

317
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:22,025
Something's wrong.

318
00:17:33,192 --> 00:17:37,317
Yes!

319
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:37,817
Yes!

320
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:38,775
YES!

321
00:17:38,858 --> 00:17:40,108
I'm getting closer!

322
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:42,233
The only thing in front
of me is one Arbalest

323
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:43,983
on the verge of overheating!

324
00:17:44,067 --> 00:17:46,900
I'm gonna run you down
and crush your little ass!

325
00:17:46,983 --> 00:17:50,275
You're trapped like a rat, boy!

326
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,358
It's time...

327
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:54,942
to finish this.

328
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:03,983
Hey!

329
00:18:04,067 --> 00:18:05,525
Where's my Arbalest?

330
00:18:09,192 --> 00:18:09,650
Oh...

331
00:18:09,733 --> 00:18:10,608
shit

332
00:18:10,692 --> 00:18:12,317
Our prey is
caught in the net!

333
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,483
Impressive, Mao!

334
00:18:13,567 --> 00:18:14,733
Just like magic!

335
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,108
Headquarters to all units.

336
00:18:17,192 --> 00:18:18,108
Listen up.

337
00:18:18,192 --> 00:18:20,442
Our Cretan history
lesson is over.

338
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,942
Fire at will and
destroy the enemy!

339
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,233
Roger that!

340
00:18:26,733 --> 00:18:26,983
No!

341
00:18:27,067 --> 00:18:27,317
No!

342
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:28,150
NO!

343
00:18:28,233 --> 00:18:29,108
What the...

344
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:30,567
hell is THIS?

345
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:32,567
I was the rat?

346
00:18:33,442 --> 00:18:35,567
Shit, our bullets
aren't even scratching it!

347
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:37,233
Is that the Lambda Driver?

348
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:38,317
Looks like it.

349
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,192
Sousuke, can you take him?

350
00:18:40,983 --> 00:18:42,067
Roger!

351
00:18:59,233 --> 00:18:59,733
Weak!

352
00:18:59,817 --> 00:19:00,483
Weak...!

353
00:19:00,567 --> 00:19:01,192
You're...

354
00:19:01,275 --> 00:19:04,067
so weak, aren't you?!

355
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:07,067
You still can't make it work?!

356
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:08,233
I don't understand this!

357
00:19:08,317 --> 00:19:10,233
It won't operate
the way I want it to!

358
00:19:10,317 --> 00:19:12,025
Thought you outsmarted me, huh?

359
00:19:12,108 --> 00:19:13,317
But NO!!!

360
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,275
Man that's disappointing.

361
00:19:15,358 --> 00:19:16,442
If that's all it can do,

362
00:19:16,525 --> 00:19:18,858
then why should I
even bother taking it?

363
00:19:18,942 --> 00:19:21,733
I'll just kill all of you
off right here!

364
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:27,442
Damn!

365
00:19:27,525 --> 00:19:29,233
Guess I spoke too soon.

366
00:19:29,317 --> 00:19:30,525
Take that!

367
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:35,358
WHAT?

368
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:40,942
DAMMIT!

369
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,900
You ARE NOT gonna make me cry!

370
00:19:42,983 --> 00:19:45,192
I don't HAVE feelings,
so you CAN'T HURT 'EM!

371
00:19:45,275 --> 00:19:47,317
And you REMEMBER that!

372
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,692
All units hold your fire
and bug out of here!

373
00:19:51,567 --> 00:19:53,483
I repeat, disengage!

374
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:56,275
Explosion at
oh-four-oh-five.

375
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,275
Large-scale flooding
is occurring.

376
00:19:58,358 --> 00:19:59,942
Most communications are down.

377
00:20:00,025 --> 00:20:02,400
We can't contact our teams!

378
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:03,275
Captain?

379
00:20:03,358 --> 00:20:04,358
It's all right.

380
00:20:04,442 --> 00:20:07,108
M9s are designed
to be amphibious.

381
00:20:07,192 --> 00:20:09,317
Flooding was a possibility.

382
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,317
This is Urzu 8.

383
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,942
Headquarters, do you read me?

384
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:15,192
We're in Bruno's room
right now, but we were too late.

385
00:20:15,275 --> 00:20:16,275
It's empty, ma'am.

386
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:18,233
I'd say it was probably him.

387
00:20:26,608 --> 00:20:28,525
Looks like we
made it out somehow.

388
00:20:28,608 --> 00:20:30,400
You still alive, Kurz?

389
00:20:30,483 --> 00:20:33,317
Yeah, but I'm not enjoying it.

390
00:20:36,483 --> 00:20:37,650
And you, Sousuke?

391
00:20:37,733 --> 00:20:38,733
Not a problem.

392
00:20:39,775 --> 00:20:41,775
So there's a traitor in Mithril?

393
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,858
Yeah.

394
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:47,275
Remember the guy who brought
us the repeaters this morning?

395
00:20:47,358 --> 00:20:49,817
That guy from
Intelligence, Bruno.

396
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,442
Seems like it was him.

397
00:20:51,525 --> 00:20:52,775
Dammit!

398
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:55,150
We got into some pretty
hot water because of him.

399
00:20:55,233 --> 00:20:56,483
We need to pay

400
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:59,108
that bastard back good for
everything he did to us.

401
00:20:59,192 --> 00:21:00,442
Oh, yeah...

402
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:03,192
Urzu 2 to headquarters.

403
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:05,067
Everyone in the AS team is safe.

404
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:06,983
We're en route to
the rendezvous point.

405
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,067
Thank goodness.

406
00:21:08,150 --> 00:21:09,900
I'll send a helicopter down.

407
00:21:09,983 --> 00:21:12,442
You saved our lives, Tessa.

408
00:21:12,525 --> 00:21:14,567
I'm grateful, Captain.

409
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:15,608
Thank you.

410
00:21:15,692 --> 00:21:17,442
Stay alert until
you're out of there.

411
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:30,900
Useless piece of junk.

412
00:21:39,108 --> 00:21:42,983
Our job to capture the
Arbalest resulted in failure.

413
00:21:43,067 --> 00:21:46,275
Yeah, all we accomplished
was ruining a tunnel...

414
00:21:46,358 --> 00:21:48,108
...and the ceasefire agreement.

415
00:21:48,192 --> 00:21:50,983
You know I hate that man
more every single day.

416
00:21:51,067 --> 00:21:54,025
I don't think I'll ever
learn to trust that bastard.

417
00:21:54,108 --> 00:21:55,900
Everything will be all right.

418
00:21:55,983 --> 00:21:58,608
Let's just do as
Sensei told us to.

419
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,525
We just have to be
patient until then.

420
00:22:01,608 --> 00:22:03,067
Big Sister...

421
00:22:03,150 --> 00:22:05,400
Uh--huh?

422
00:22:05,483 --> 00:22:07,442
It's so cold up here.

423
00:22:07,525 --> 00:22:08,608
Yeah, you're right.

424
00:22:08,692 --> 00:22:10,817
Let's just go home.

425
00:23:47,775 --> 00:23:50,608
The traitor has hidden himself
within a powerful mafia.

426
00:23:50,692 --> 00:23:53,775
The wind off of the
Mediterranean, an unspoken rule,

427
00:23:53,858 --> 00:23:57,150
an unexpected riot, and
a jet-black assailant.

428
00:23:57,233 --> 00:23:59,692
Next time:
"Beautiful Sicily."

429
00:23:59,775 --> 00:24:01,983
Even if you try running
to the ends of the Earth,

430
00:24:02,067 --> 00:24:04,025
I WILL chase you down.
