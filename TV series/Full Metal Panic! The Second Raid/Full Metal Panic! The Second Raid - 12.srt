1
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:07,608
Back to our top story: the
Beijing government has held

2
00:02:07,692 --> 00:02:10,067
a press conference stating
emphatically that they want

3
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,192
to see an end to
the crisis by 6 a.m.

4
00:02:13,275 --> 00:02:16,483
Democratic Federation of
China Secretary-General Chang

5
00:02:16,567 --> 00:02:18,525
responded with a press
conference of his own

6
00:02:18,608 --> 00:02:20,025
in the South.

7
00:02:20,108 --> 00:02:22,317
During that press conference,
he postulated a connection

8
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,150
between the terrorist acts
of the unidentified arm slave

9
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:27,608
in Hong Kong and
the current crisis...

10
00:02:27,692 --> 00:02:29,192
Listen up, SRT.

11
00:02:29,275 --> 00:02:31,150
We got till 0600.

12
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:32,733
That's 90 minutes from now.

13
00:02:32,817 --> 00:02:34,692
If we fail, that's it.

14
00:02:34,775 --> 00:02:37,817
Hong Kong will
burn to the ground.

15
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:40,567
And you know it's probably
not gonna stop there, either.

16
00:02:42,567 --> 00:02:43,358
God damn!

17
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:45,067
You didn't even do any damage!

18
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,858
Have a soft spot
for women, don't you?

19
00:02:47,942 --> 00:02:50,483
Haven't you tracked down
Yu Fang yet?

20
00:02:50,567 --> 00:02:52,608
It's funny you
should mention that.

21
00:02:52,692 --> 00:02:54,025
Check this out.

22
00:02:59,733 --> 00:03:02,650
Yu Fang, this is your
poor little sister!!!

23
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,692
These men are
so hairy and scary!!!

24
00:03:05,775 --> 00:03:06,483
Don't do that!

25
00:03:06,567 --> 00:03:06,983
No!

26
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:09,192
Let me go!

27
00:03:09,275 --> 00:03:12,525
They CAUGHT me and
they're, they're...!

28
00:03:12,608 --> 00:03:13,900
Please help me!

29
00:03:13,983 --> 00:03:15,400
Ow!

30
00:03:15,483 --> 00:03:16,858
They're killing me!

31
00:03:16,942 --> 00:03:17,983
No more!

32
00:03:18,067 --> 00:03:19,983
Don't poke me THERE!

33
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:27,067
Neither the North nor the
South would have a motivation

34
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:30,025
for launching an attack
like this in Hong Kong.

35
00:03:30,108 --> 00:03:32,025
Plus, there's no pattern
to the Venom's actions,

36
00:03:32,108 --> 00:03:34,483
so it has to be
the work of an outsider.

37
00:03:34,567 --> 00:03:37,192
So who in the hell would profit
from the North and the South

38
00:03:37,275 --> 00:03:39,733
constantly being at
each other's throats?

39
00:03:39,817 --> 00:03:42,525
We've got to find the answer
fast or we're all going to be

40
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,775
up to our asses in trouble here.

41
00:03:47,608 --> 00:03:49,567
Mister Hunter, there's
someone here to see you.

42
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:50,858
She's acting quite agitated

43
00:03:50,942 --> 00:03:52,983
and she's claims it's
extremely urgent, sir.

44
00:03:53,067 --> 00:03:54,650
Show her to the door, please.

45
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:56,358
I'm too busy handling
this current crisis to...

46
00:03:56,442 --> 00:03:58,442
Just get the hell out of my way!

47
00:03:58,525 --> 00:03:59,150
What are you doing?!

48
00:03:59,233 --> 00:04:00,400
You can't come in here!

49
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:03,025
I said I need to see him NOW!

50
00:04:03,108 --> 00:04:04,692
Helmajistani?

51
00:04:04,775 --> 00:04:05,942
Well.

52
00:04:06,025 --> 00:04:07,192
There aren't a whole lot
of Middle Eastern people

53
00:04:07,275 --> 00:04:09,692
around here, so I'm not
sure if there is anyone.

54
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:12,317
But, an Arab guy
works in that shop.

55
00:04:16,983 --> 00:04:17,525
Heh...

56
00:04:17,608 --> 00:04:19,150
you're Kashim?

57
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,358
You stink of alcohol,
you worthless punk!

58
00:04:22,442 --> 00:04:25,150
Bdakshon's Tiger
should be ashamed of you!

59
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:26,233
Not my problem.

60
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:28,108
What's your business with me?

61
00:04:30,233 --> 00:04:30,775
Well...

62
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,233
Some Chinese girl

63
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:34,442
dropped this off here and
asked me to give it to you.

64
00:04:34,525 --> 00:04:35,317
Just take it...

65
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,025
and get out of here!

66
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,025
Five possible sniping positions.

67
00:05:37,275 --> 00:05:38,858
Sousuke Sagara, correct?

68
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,442
Affirmative.

69
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:42,900
There is a taxi waiting for you
at the north end of the park.

70
00:05:42,983 --> 00:05:44,400
Get in it.

71
00:05:48,942 --> 00:05:50,400
Who asked you to do this?

72
00:05:50,483 --> 00:05:51,942
Can you tell me

73
00:05:52,025 --> 00:05:54,483
if this is connected to the
arm slave incident in some way?

74
00:06:10,275 --> 00:06:12,108
Identify yourself.

75
00:06:12,192 --> 00:06:14,067
My name's not important,

76
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,192
Sousuke Sagara.

77
00:06:18,275 --> 00:06:22,233
Go to the second floor
of the building behind you.

78
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:24,358
He'll be quite glad to see you.

79
00:06:24,442 --> 00:06:26,858
You'll know the room
when you see it.

80
00:06:26,942 --> 00:06:28,567
Who's waiting for me?

81
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:31,942
You'd do well to remember
the name of this place...

82
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:42,983
It's Kowloon...

83
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:36,442
Hey!

84
00:07:36,525 --> 00:07:38,442
Been about three months,
hasn't it?

85
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:42,525
It's so good to see
you again, Kashim.

86
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:44,275
What in the hell?!

87
00:07:44,358 --> 00:07:45,317
What's the matter, kid?

88
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,150
You look like
you've seen a ghost.

89
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:50,650
Are you more shocked to see me
alive, or to see me like this?

90
00:07:50,733 --> 00:07:51,817
This can't be...

91
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:53,067
you're supposed to be...

92
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:55,275
Thought I was dead, huh?

93
00:07:55,358 --> 00:07:57,442
My unit had a
lambda driver too.

94
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:59,608
Or had you
forgotten about that?

95
00:08:00,692 --> 00:08:01,942
It was even powerful enough

96
00:08:02,025 --> 00:08:05,442
to save me from the
self-destruct sequence.

97
00:08:06,858 --> 00:08:07,942
Well...

98
00:08:08,025 --> 00:08:09,983
That is, if you can
call THIS "saved"...

99
00:08:11,108 --> 00:08:12,483
Now, now...

100
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,108
You're really gonna shoot
a poor man on his death bed?

101
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:18,025
Acting on your emotions
isn't the way I trained you...

102
00:08:18,108 --> 00:08:19,025
Kashim.

103
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,233
What the hell do
you want with me?!

104
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:20,733
Oooo...

105
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,067
kay.

106
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,108
I really just wanted to
talk with you, that's all.

107
00:08:24,192 --> 00:08:25,483
Just get to the point!

108
00:08:25,567 --> 00:08:27,358
But I missed you, Kashim!

109
00:08:29,692 --> 00:08:33,608
As you can obviously see,
I'm leaving this party soon.

110
00:08:33,692 --> 00:08:36,192
I had the Codarl
run wild in the city,

111
00:08:36,275 --> 00:08:39,317
to lure you here with
your little arm slave...

112
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,067
And we scattered special
messages--just for you--

113
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:44,942
all over the city.

114
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:48,150
Majid was a tactical genius
who made a name for himself

115
00:08:48,233 --> 00:08:50,733
as a guerilla leader
in Helmajistan.

116
00:08:50,817 --> 00:08:53,442
They called him
"Bdakshon's Tiger."

117
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:58,108
And then there's the assassin
he gave a name to: Kashim.

118
00:08:58,192 --> 00:09:02,067
Which makes YOU "The son
of Bdakshon's Tiger."

119
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:05,567
The electrician named
Hamidra was a comrade of yours

120
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,233
and I knew that
if I sent a message to

121
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:09,650
"Meet Hamidra
at Tsim Sha Tsui,"

122
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:12,650
you'd look for a
Helmajistani electrician.

123
00:09:12,733 --> 00:09:14,108
It was a message

124
00:09:14,192 --> 00:09:17,733
that no one in world but you
could possibly understand.

125
00:09:17,817 --> 00:09:18,817
But you know...

126
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,150
I would've thought

127
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,608
you'd bring along a bunch
of your Mithril buddies.

128
00:09:22,692 --> 00:09:24,608
But why did you
come by yourself?

129
00:09:24,692 --> 00:09:26,192
Trouble in paradise?

130
00:09:26,275 --> 00:09:28,192
That's none of your business!

131
00:09:28,275 --> 00:09:29,400
Heh...

132
00:09:29,483 --> 00:09:30,858
You're starting to feel
a bit uncomfortable,

133
00:09:30,942 --> 00:09:32,650
aren't you little Kashim?

134
00:09:32,733 --> 00:09:33,567
What do you mean?

135
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:34,817
With Mithril...

136
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:36,358
Right?

137
00:09:36,442 --> 00:09:39,400
I mean being in a paramilitary
unit that runs around acting

138
00:09:39,483 --> 00:09:41,858
like self-styled allies
of justice would be enough

139
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:43,733
to piss anyone off.

140
00:09:43,817 --> 00:09:45,108
Wouldn't it?

141
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:52,525
If you're done with all your
bullshit tell me about

142
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:56,108
the organization that hired you
and what they're trying to do.

143
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,608
That's commendable.

144
00:09:58,692 --> 00:10:02,233
You're always "on the clock",
aren't you my boy?

145
00:10:02,317 --> 00:10:03,900
Okay, Tiger.

146
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:06,067
I'll tell you.

147
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:07,942
They're called "Amalgam."

148
00:10:08,025 --> 00:10:11,275
That's the name of the
organization I was working for.

149
00:10:11,358 --> 00:10:14,067
They develop next-gen weaponry
and test the stuff out

150
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:16,608
in tactical situations.

151
00:10:16,692 --> 00:10:19,650
They even create conflicts
to make it happen.

152
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,733
There are a lot of people
who keep Amalgam busy

153
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,942
in the right wing of all
the world's governments.

154
00:10:25,025 --> 00:10:28,067
East and West both want a cold
war, a steady stream of shit

155
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,817
that goes "boom" so they
can just blame the other guy.

156
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,942
And are they the ones

157
00:10:33,025 --> 00:10:35,192
responsible for the
attacks here, too?

158
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:37,858
No, I had the girls
do that one for me.

159
00:10:37,942 --> 00:10:40,650
I'll bet those idiots from
Amalgam are going apeshit trying

160
00:10:40,733 --> 00:10:44,025
to find out where we're hiding
and what we're gonna do next.

161
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:47,900
Venom!

162
00:10:47,983 --> 00:10:49,317
Well, Yu Fang...

163
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,150
I have to leave now, Sensei.

164
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:52,317
All right.

165
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,150
Have fun out there.

166
00:10:54,233 --> 00:10:56,192
Farewell, Sensei.

167
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:03,900
A long time ago, I took in and
raised a pair of twin girls

168
00:11:03,983 --> 00:11:06,858
named Yu Fang and Yu Lan.

169
00:11:06,942 --> 00:11:09,233
The three of you
have a lot in common.

170
00:11:09,317 --> 00:11:12,025
You're loyal like dogs
are to their masters.

171
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:16,733
This city is gonna burn to the
ground because I ordered it.

172
00:11:16,817 --> 00:11:18,650
Yu Fang is gonna die.

173
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:22,317
And I imagine if Mithril doesn't
come after her I suppose

174
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:25,608
Amalgam's expeditionaries
will end up taking her out.

175
00:11:25,692 --> 00:11:27,650
Expeditionaries?

176
00:11:27,733 --> 00:11:29,817
Scary sons of bitches...

177
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:30,983
Their boss is the scariest

178
00:11:31,067 --> 00:11:33,983
of the bunch and
he's got skills to match.

179
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:36,442
Your friends
don't stand a chance.

180
00:11:36,525 --> 00:11:37,775
They'll see him long enough

181
00:11:37,858 --> 00:11:40,483
to know who punched their
tickets and that's it.

182
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,400
Mister Gates!

183
00:11:41,483 --> 00:11:43,067
We've sighted her downtown!

184
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,275
YES!

185
00:11:44,358 --> 00:11:47,192
Better run, kitty cat,
'cause here we come!

186
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:50,900
You said "Amalgam," right?

187
00:11:50,983 --> 00:11:53,525
Are there any Whispered
in that organization?

188
00:11:53,608 --> 00:11:54,608
Yeah.

189
00:11:54,692 --> 00:11:56,983
And he's already
one of the big shots...

190
00:11:57,067 --> 00:11:59,900
Then why in the hell are they
still going after Chidori?

191
00:11:59,983 --> 00:12:02,150
What do they think
they need her for?

192
00:12:02,233 --> 00:12:04,192
Because that's
just the way it works.

193
00:12:04,275 --> 00:12:06,858
Every Whispered's brain
is wired differently.

194
00:12:06,942 --> 00:12:10,067
Each one is a prodigy
in a different field.

195
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:12,817
So, if there's someone knows
the Lambda Driver technology

196
00:12:12,900 --> 00:12:15,775
in America, there might be
someone in Italy who knows about

197
00:12:15,858 --> 00:12:18,108
submarines and nothing else.

198
00:12:18,192 --> 00:12:20,192
Every time they find
a new Whispered,

199
00:12:20,275 --> 00:12:23,692
the kid has to be tested to
find out what the value is.

200
00:12:23,775 --> 00:12:25,150
That's why we had
that little party

201
00:12:25,233 --> 00:12:27,650
in the Khanka Autonomous
Region a while back.

202
00:12:27,733 --> 00:12:29,192
Testing.

203
00:12:29,275 --> 00:12:32,858
And the results said Kaname
Chidori is most definitely

204
00:12:32,942 --> 00:12:34,900
one of the Whispered.

205
00:12:34,983 --> 00:12:38,025
Not sure what her
specific skills are, though.

206
00:12:38,108 --> 00:12:40,150
Where is Amalgam's base hidden?!

207
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,525
And who are their key leaders?

208
00:12:42,608 --> 00:12:45,775
All this Amalgam talk
is getting boring.

209
00:12:45,858 --> 00:12:47,483
Just take it easy...

210
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,942
you oughta lighten up a bit.

211
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:51,358
Go ahead.

212
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:54,483
you'd be doing me a favor
at this stage of the game.

213
00:12:58,525 --> 00:12:59,358
Just tell me.

214
00:12:59,442 --> 00:13:01,442
Please tell me.

215
00:13:01,525 --> 00:13:02,525
Did you say...

216
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:03,775
"please"?

217
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:06,525
Are you really the same
Kashim you used to be?

218
00:13:06,608 --> 00:13:07,567
I'm not.

219
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:09,483
Don't you remember, Kashim?

220
00:13:09,567 --> 00:13:12,275
We met for the first time
five years ago.

221
00:13:12,358 --> 00:13:15,108
I was teaching at
a mercenary camp.

222
00:13:15,192 --> 00:13:18,192
You were fighting the
Soviets in Helmajistan.

223
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:21,525
We weren't allies but we
weren't really enemies, either.

224
00:13:21,608 --> 00:13:24,317
I remember it reaaally well.

225
00:13:25,483 --> 00:13:27,817
There was something
about your eyes.

226
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:30,608
The ultimate window
to a tortured soul

227
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,275
No worry in them at all.

228
00:13:33,358 --> 00:13:36,317
Neither rejecting,
nor affirming life.

229
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:40,858
No doubt, suffering or
feeling sorry for yourself.

230
00:13:40,942 --> 00:13:42,275
They were beautiful.

231
00:13:42,358 --> 00:13:46,317
Like the eyes of
a goddamned saint.

232
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,942
Truly amazing.

233
00:13:48,025 --> 00:13:51,400
There was no contradiction or
confusion in your eyes at all.

234
00:13:51,483 --> 00:13:53,817
And when we met again
in Khanka those eyes of yours

235
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:56,442
were just as beautiful
as I had remembered.

236
00:13:56,525 --> 00:14:00,275
Those were the eyes of a man
with no human weaknesses at all.

237
00:14:00,358 --> 00:14:02,358
And all I could think of
was how nice it'd be to

238
00:14:02,442 --> 00:14:04,233
kill a man like that.

239
00:14:04,317 --> 00:14:08,483
But I see you now and I wonder.

240
00:14:08,567 --> 00:14:10,692
What the hell
happened to those eyes?

241
00:14:14,192 --> 00:14:15,358
Venom acquired!

242
00:14:15,442 --> 00:14:17,192
They're in the Jordan area.

243
00:14:17,275 --> 00:14:20,483
Get the ARX-7 ready for launch
with a rapid-deployment booster

244
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:21,900
on the double.

245
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:25,442
Arm it with a Boxer shot
cannon and put it on standby.

246
00:14:25,525 --> 00:14:26,983
Madame Captain.

247
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,567
I must remind you that use of
the Arbalest is prohibited.

248
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:31,442
We can still use it as a decoy.

249
00:14:31,525 --> 00:14:34,567
I want to reduce the danger
out there as much as possible.

250
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:35,567
And besides...

251
00:14:35,650 --> 00:14:37,608
Sagara's still missing...

252
00:14:37,692 --> 00:14:40,483
I'm sorry to say this Captain,
but at this point I can only

253
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:43,692
conclude that Sergeant Sagara
has abandoned the mission.

254
00:14:43,775 --> 00:14:46,067
Relying on that man
and that machine would

255
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:48,067
be a grievous error in judgment.

256
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,233
How can you be so certain?

257
00:14:50,317 --> 00:14:53,150
This is NOT some damned
after-school activity!

258
00:14:53,233 --> 00:14:54,358
That's enough!

259
00:14:54,442 --> 00:14:56,150
This isn't the time
or place for a lecture!

260
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:57,150
But Ma'am!

261
00:14:57,233 --> 00:14:59,650
I can't just
stand by and watch!

262
00:14:59,733 --> 00:15:01,025
It's unconscionable!

263
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:02,775
You're letting your
personal feelings interfere

264
00:15:02,858 --> 00:15:04,108
with your judgment.

265
00:15:04,192 --> 00:15:06,525
And you're even trying
to circumvent your orders!

266
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:08,775
You're giving preferential
treatment to a deserter

267
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:11,150
and jeopardizing the
discipline of this command!

268
00:15:11,233 --> 00:15:12,733
It's outrageous!

269
00:15:12,817 --> 00:15:15,983
Well, then perhaps you'd care
to explain exactly who it was

270
00:15:16,067 --> 00:15:19,608
that forced him to accept all
those heavy responsibilities?

271
00:15:19,692 --> 00:15:20,442
But Ma'am...

272
00:15:20,525 --> 00:15:21,692
WE did, damn it!

273
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:24,317
And I'd dare you
to tell me otherwise!

274
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:27,317
Six months ago can you tell
me who risked his own life

275
00:15:27,400 --> 00:15:29,275
in order to provide
valuable information during

276
00:15:29,358 --> 00:15:30,858
the airport siege?

277
00:15:30,942 --> 00:15:33,483
Four months ago who was it who
defeated the Behemoth without

278
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:35,817
any prior preparation
or knowledge?

279
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,192
Any ideas, Commander Mardukas?!

280
00:15:38,275 --> 00:15:41,108
And in Helmajistan, who
recaptured a nuclear warhead

281
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:43,942
and completed his mission
objectives even as his comrades

282
00:15:44,025 --> 00:15:45,858
were being slaughtered
left and right?

283
00:15:45,942 --> 00:15:47,983
Three months ago
who was it who gave his all

284
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,192
to protect this
ship we call home?

285
00:15:50,275 --> 00:15:53,483
So tell me then, who was it?!

286
00:15:53,567 --> 00:15:55,150
It was Sergeant Sagara.

287
00:15:55,233 --> 00:15:56,692
That's correct.

288
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,442
But you're still going to try
to place the blame on him...

289
00:15:58,525 --> 00:16:01,442
and then stand there and
condemn him as a coward?!

290
00:16:02,692 --> 00:16:03,817
No.

291
00:16:05,442 --> 00:16:07,233
If you really want me to do it

292
00:16:07,317 --> 00:16:09,650
I'll admit it that
I'm in love with him.

293
00:16:09,733 --> 00:16:12,275
It's true; but those
feelings aren't important.

294
00:16:12,358 --> 00:16:14,733
I have full faith
in him as a soldier.

295
00:16:14,817 --> 00:16:18,442
No matter how hopeless he seems
right now, he won't abandon us.

296
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:22,358
He will pull himself together
and come back to help us!

297
00:16:22,442 --> 00:16:25,067
His heart is strong
and compassionate.

298
00:16:25,150 --> 00:16:28,108
And you can't change
a person's basic nature.

299
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:30,942
"His heart is strong
and compassionate"?

300
00:16:31,025 --> 00:16:32,275
Now honestly.

301
00:16:32,358 --> 00:16:34,192
Do you really think that's
enough to convince me?

302
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,233
Convincing you
isn't my objective!

303
00:16:36,317 --> 00:16:38,233
There you are,
questioning my judgement...

304
00:16:38,317 --> 00:16:41,025
and my fitness to command.

305
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,650
So, Commander
Richard Mardukas...

306
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:45,692
Do you believe in me
or don't you?

307
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:48,775
Are you going to trust me,
Teletha Testarossa,

308
00:16:48,858 --> 00:16:52,567
a loyal captain who has always
sought to protect her ship...

309
00:16:52,650 --> 00:16:54,692
or aren't you?

310
00:16:54,775 --> 00:16:56,733
Well?

311
00:17:06,858 --> 00:17:09,108
Yes, you have been
a strong leader...

312
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:13,233
Aye-aye, Captain!

313
00:17:13,317 --> 00:17:14,317
We will ready the Arbalest

314
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,692
with a rapid deployment
booster system.

315
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:19,400
Make for a standard loadout
with a Boxer shot cannon,

316
00:17:19,483 --> 00:17:21,775
and standby in the elevator!

317
00:17:21,858 --> 00:17:24,317
Arming the ARX-7 with
rapid deployment booster

318
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,067
and Boxer shot cannon.

319
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,525
Standing by in the elevator.

320
00:17:27,608 --> 00:17:28,900
Aye, sir!

321
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,067
I thank you.

322
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:35,108
Let's do what we can
get everyone back safely!

323
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:37,483
Holy crap...

324
00:17:37,567 --> 00:17:39,733
I don't remember
opening that channel.

325
00:17:39,817 --> 00:17:42,817
Could someone on the Danaan have
sent that to us on purpose?

326
00:17:42,900 --> 00:17:43,733
Who knows?

327
00:17:43,817 --> 00:17:45,067
Wow, I never thought Tessa

328
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:48,483
would take a chunk out of
the XO's ass like that.

329
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:51,233
So, she wants everybody
to make it back safely.

330
00:17:51,317 --> 00:17:52,983
Well, how about it, guys?

331
00:17:53,067 --> 00:17:54,733
Woman after my own heart.

332
00:17:54,817 --> 00:17:56,025
Yeah, we can't go out there

333
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:58,608
and disappoint our princess
by dying on her.

334
00:17:58,692 --> 00:18:01,650
It's pretty cool she's actually
worried about us like that.

335
00:18:01,733 --> 00:18:03,358
makes me all warm and fuzzy.

336
00:18:03,442 --> 00:18:04,775
She's always been like that.

337
00:18:04,858 --> 00:18:06,858
Hell of an officer in my book.

338
00:18:06,942 --> 00:18:08,692
We've got till 0-600, people!

339
00:18:08,775 --> 00:18:10,942
You better live up to
your reputations today.

340
00:18:11,025 --> 00:18:12,983
I don't make mistakes
and you don't either.

341
00:18:13,067 --> 00:18:15,983
We get in, get out,
and call this a done deal.

342
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:17,275
Got it?

343
00:18:17,358 --> 00:18:18,650
Roger!

344
00:18:48,942 --> 00:18:51,025
What a pitiful look
on your face.

345
00:18:51,108 --> 00:18:54,817
Are you actually worried
or torn up over something?

346
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,900
What happened to that "killer
saint" I met five years ago?

347
00:18:57,983 --> 00:18:59,525
You really disappoint me.

348
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:00,817
A guy full of self-doubt

349
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,983
and morality is
hardly worth killing.

350
00:19:03,067 --> 00:19:04,442
That's enough!

351
00:19:04,525 --> 00:19:07,067
You're the same as I am,
you dumb son of a bitch,

352
00:19:07,150 --> 00:19:09,525
so why are you putting on
this "normal guy" act?

353
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,608
I think I'm gonna puke!

354
00:19:10,692 --> 00:19:11,900
I'm telling you to shut up!

355
00:19:11,983 --> 00:19:13,900
Yeah, well let me
tell YOU somethin'...

356
00:19:13,983 --> 00:19:15,983
Ever since you started
workin' with Mithril

357
00:19:16,067 --> 00:19:18,733
and playin' schoolboy
you've been worthless.

358
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:21,067
And once those snakes got
their coils around you,

359
00:19:21,150 --> 00:19:23,317
you became boring and lifeless.

360
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,733
It's no fucking wonder you've
become so frustrated, Kashim.

361
00:19:26,817 --> 00:19:28,858
It's all that bullshit
they're preachin'.

362
00:19:28,942 --> 00:19:31,317
Their so-called "humanism."

363
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:35,192
The killer-saint Kashim I knew
would never fit in there.

364
00:19:35,275 --> 00:19:38,067
You're being suckered in
and you don't even know it.

365
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:39,400
Listen.

366
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:42,108
Weak people are parasites
who feed on the strong.

367
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:45,067
They'll drain you dry with all
these beautiful bullshittisms

368
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:46,317
like "You're valued,"

369
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:49,525
and "Of course we really
trust you, Sousuke!"

370
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:51,275
So how does it feel?

371
00:19:51,358 --> 00:19:54,775
Do you really like being around
a bunch of goddamn weaklings?

372
00:19:54,858 --> 00:19:56,692
Go ahead and tell me.

373
00:19:56,775 --> 00:19:58,942
I'm asking you if you
really enjoy being around

374
00:19:59,025 --> 00:20:00,192
a bunch of weaklings.

375
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:01,025
Do you?

376
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:02,775
I said to shut the hell up!

377
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:08,400
What, you don't even have
the balls to kill me?

378
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,525
I'm dying soon enough anyway.

379
00:20:13,608 --> 00:20:17,608
And I plan on taking a bunch
of these parasites with me.

380
00:20:17,692 --> 00:20:20,650
I told Yu Fang to take care of
a little business for me

381
00:20:20,733 --> 00:20:23,650
and turn this city into
a living hell on earth.

382
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:26,650
Yu Lan should've already
killed the biggest cancer.

383
00:20:26,733 --> 00:20:29,150
the one who caused your
downfall and turned you into

384
00:20:29,233 --> 00:20:31,942
a mewling excuse
of a man, Kashim.

385
00:20:32,025 --> 00:20:32,858
Who?

386
00:20:32,942 --> 00:20:34,233
Your little girlfriend.

387
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,525
Oh no...

388
00:20:35,608 --> 00:20:37,483
Don't tell me you haven't
heard the news yet?

389
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:40,025
Well, I got to hear
every single word of it.

390
00:20:40,108 --> 00:20:42,608
Her body was mangled and
there was blood all over

391
00:20:42,692 --> 00:20:46,025
that cute little schoolgirl
uniform of hers.

392
00:20:46,108 --> 00:20:47,858
Heard the little bitch
was pretty tough and she

393
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:49,775
didn't beg for her life.

394
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:52,150
She just said, "I'm sorry"
before she died.

395
00:20:52,233 --> 00:20:54,692
Makes me wonder
who that was meant for.

396
00:20:54,775 --> 00:20:55,650
You're lying!

397
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,608
No I'm nooooooot!

398
00:20:57,692 --> 00:21:00,025
Wish I'd thought of it earlier,
but I should've shown you

399
00:21:00,108 --> 00:21:02,358
a picture of the cold
and mangled body.

400
00:21:02,442 --> 00:21:05,150
The look on your face
woulda been priceless!

401
00:21:05,233 --> 00:21:06,400
But that's okay.

402
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,608
I can see the damage
is already done!

403
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:10,233
Ohh YEAH!

404
00:21:12,025 --> 00:21:15,108
♪ Poor girlie from Tokyo. ♪

405
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:17,400
♪ we made her bleed. ♪

406
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:21,442
It's a damn shame too,
that little Kaname

407
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:23,025
was such a nice girl!

408
00:21:23,108 --> 00:21:24,483
You son of a BITCH!

409
00:21:24,567 --> 00:21:25,150
Yeah!

410
00:21:25,233 --> 00:21:26,525
She's fuckin' dead!

411
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,608
And I'm the one who
made sure it happened.

412
00:21:28,692 --> 00:21:30,817
So what're you gonna
do about it, Kashim?!

413
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:31,400
Huh?

414
00:21:31,483 --> 00:21:32,483
Huh?!

415
00:23:47,442 --> 00:23:48,942
Gauron.

416
00:23:49,025 --> 00:23:52,150
My old enemy was the only one
who saw all the way through me.

417
00:23:52,233 --> 00:23:53,900
Now, the real devil beckons,

418
00:23:53,983 --> 00:23:57,192
and the final calculated
curse is about to surface.

419
00:23:57,275 --> 00:24:01,317
Next time, the final episode:
"The Continuing Day by Day."

420
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:05,442
Only one thing can crush
despair: A single fierce blow.
