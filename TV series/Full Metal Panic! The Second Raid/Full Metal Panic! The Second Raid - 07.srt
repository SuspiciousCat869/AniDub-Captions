1
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:10,900
So it's Wraith...

2
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:12,692
that bastard.

3
00:02:16,483 --> 00:02:17,942
Where are you?!

4
00:02:20,275 --> 00:02:22,983
Get out here and
talk to me NOW, Wraith!

5
00:02:23,067 --> 00:02:24,192
I know you can hear me!

6
00:02:24,275 --> 00:02:26,025
Show yourself, dammit!

7
00:02:29,525 --> 00:02:32,025
I am Sergeant Sousuke Sagara
of Mithril's Tactical Division

8
00:02:32,108 --> 00:02:35,108
from the West Pacific Fleet
flagship Tuatha De Danaan!

9
00:02:35,192 --> 00:02:36,400
As of 20 April,

10
00:02:36,483 --> 00:02:38,483
I have been assigned
to guard a certain person.

11
00:02:38,567 --> 00:02:40,442
My superiors have reason
to believe that this person

12
00:02:40,525 --> 00:02:43,108
has been targeted for
the following reasons!

13
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:44,692
First!

14
00:02:44,775 --> 00:02:47,192
This person is a special kind of
individual known as a Whispered.

15
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:48,067
Second!

16
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:49,608
The Whispered possess advanced,

17
00:02:49,692 --> 00:02:52,733
hidden knowledge of interest
to worldwide military powers.

18
00:02:55,317 --> 00:02:56,983
Are you insane?

19
00:02:57,067 --> 00:03:00,150
Is sabotaging this mission by
screaming top-secret information

20
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:03,150
at the top of your lungs your
idea of keeping Chidori safe?

21
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,150
Then I guess you
shouldn't have ignored me.

22
00:03:05,233 --> 00:03:07,858
Urzu 7, forcing this
discourse between us

23
00:03:07,942 --> 00:03:09,817
is dangerous to our objective.

24
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:12,067
It's hard for me to believe
that you don't get it.

25
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,608
Answer me quickly, then.

26
00:03:13,692 --> 00:03:17,025
Is your mission to guard Kaname
Chidori, or to observe her?

27
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:18,483
I have no comment.

28
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:20,525
Then, having already
been relieved of duty,

29
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:22,150
I could just spend
the rest of the evening

30
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,817
telling the neighborhood
everything, couldn't I?

31
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,192
And now you're
threatening me, Urzu 7?

32
00:03:27,275 --> 00:03:29,942
I will have to report this
to the Tactical Division.

33
00:03:30,025 --> 00:03:31,150
Fine by me.

34
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,192
But you will
answer the question.

35
00:03:36,108 --> 00:03:37,358
My mission is to guard.

36
00:03:37,442 --> 00:03:38,900
I don't trust you.

37
00:03:38,983 --> 00:03:41,358
It's not your place to say.

38
00:03:41,442 --> 00:03:43,983
The mission I was given clearly
states that Kaname Chidori

39
00:03:44,067 --> 00:03:46,983
will not fall into the hands
of another organization.

40
00:03:47,067 --> 00:03:49,192
Nothing more, nothing less.

41
00:03:49,275 --> 00:03:51,025
You haven't performed that duty.

42
00:03:51,108 --> 00:03:53,525
She's been surrounded by
a gang of delinquents...

43
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,233
and kidnapped by
a band of thugs,

44
00:03:55,317 --> 00:03:57,525
she's been in danger
numerous times.

45
00:03:57,608 --> 00:04:00,483
The acts of insignificant
hoodlums and children are not

46
00:04:00,567 --> 00:04:02,983
the same as enemy
operations, sergeant.

47
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,942
Unsatisfactory, Wraith.

48
00:04:05,025 --> 00:04:06,858
If you were truly
upholding your stated mission,

49
00:04:06,942 --> 00:04:09,692
then why didn't you intervene
in the A21 incident?

50
00:04:09,775 --> 00:04:11,817
Can you answer that?

51
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:12,692
Well?

52
00:04:12,775 --> 00:04:14,525
Let's hear it!

53
00:04:14,608 --> 00:04:17,233
My initial intention had been
to leave the enemy at large

54
00:04:17,317 --> 00:04:19,733
however the situation
got out of my control.

55
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:24,275
Even I broke into a cold sweat
during that hostage exchange

56
00:04:24,358 --> 00:04:27,025
but my decision to stand
down proved to be correct.

57
00:04:27,108 --> 00:04:30,192
Those terrorists failed to
grasp how important she is,

58
00:04:30,275 --> 00:04:31,942
so they didn't
compromise the information

59
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:33,817
she was carrying inside of her.

60
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:36,483
They were barely better
than hoodlums themselves...

61
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:37,942
Revisionist thinking.

62
00:04:38,025 --> 00:04:39,608
Spin it in any way you like.

63
00:04:39,692 --> 00:04:41,733
The fact remains that
Kaname Chidori's knowledge

64
00:04:41,817 --> 00:04:43,442
as a Whispered is safe.

65
00:04:43,525 --> 00:04:46,983
As long as her information is in
no danger of being compromised,

66
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,983
I do not have any
outstanding obligations

67
00:04:49,067 --> 00:04:50,817
to act in this matter.

68
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:52,317
So you admit it, then.

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,233
If you let her die it would
be a tremendous loss to us.

70
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:56,608
At the very least,

71
00:04:56,692 --> 00:04:58,400
I am bound to protect
her knowledge and her life.

72
00:04:58,483 --> 00:04:59,900
I don't believe you.

73
00:04:59,983 --> 00:05:02,942
I'm not expecting you to believe
anything I've said anyway.

74
00:05:03,025 --> 00:05:05,400
Go worry yourself to death.

75
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,692
Intelligence was to have
taken over this surveillance

76
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,483
after the
Khanka Airport Incident.

77
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:14,358
But Tactical demanded that
you remain on--objective.

78
00:05:14,442 --> 00:05:17,025
They believed you'd
be an effective decoy.

79
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:18,733
But to me you have
been nothing more than

80
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:20,858
an unwelcome distraction.

81
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:23,817
Sagara, you have no idea
how many times...

82
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:26,942
I've wanted to kill you off and
make it look like one of your

83
00:05:27,025 --> 00:05:30,650
"accidents." It's never too late
to try if you're up for it.

84
00:05:30,733 --> 00:05:32,692
It was a JOKE, Sagara.

85
00:05:32,775 --> 00:05:35,733
I doubt I could eliminate you
without getting MYSELF hurt.

86
00:05:35,817 --> 00:05:37,733
And actually you're
pretty amusing!

87
00:05:37,817 --> 00:05:39,233
What?

88
00:05:39,317 --> 00:05:41,275
Your soldier's instincts are
both your greatest blessing

89
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:43,192
and your deepest curse.

90
00:05:43,275 --> 00:05:46,233
Just aiming a rifle at you
from sniping distance is enough

91
00:05:46,317 --> 00:05:49,650
to make you dance like
a cat on a hot tin roof.

92
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:53,858
And your performance at the
beauty shop today was priceless.

93
00:05:53,942 --> 00:05:55,317
You bastard!

94
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,233
Come on now,
don't get so angry.

95
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:00,900
As of today your fun with the
high school children is done

96
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:03,150
and you should be heading back
to your original mission,

97
00:06:03,233 --> 00:06:04,608
don't you think?

98
00:06:04,692 --> 00:06:06,608
We're both professionals, here.

99
00:06:06,692 --> 00:06:08,025
Let's play the part.

100
00:06:08,108 --> 00:06:09,650
I can't do that.

101
00:06:09,733 --> 00:06:10,942
Chidori's safety...

102
00:06:11,025 --> 00:06:13,067
Is no longer your concern
now that Mithril has

103
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:16,567
given you orders to
withdraw, sergeant.

104
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:19,983
Surely, you're not planning
on disobeying those orders?

105
00:06:20,067 --> 00:06:21,733
Guess we'll see...

106
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,858
Could it be you've forgotten
that your life here is nothing

107
00:06:23,942 --> 00:06:25,983
but a cover provided by Mithril?

108
00:06:26,067 --> 00:06:27,442
Get it through
your head, Sagara!

109
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:28,858
You're not
a high school student.

110
00:06:28,942 --> 00:06:30,483
You're a professional killer!

111
00:06:30,567 --> 00:06:32,650
Your family records and
registration at the school

112
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:33,775
are a ruse...

113
00:06:33,858 --> 00:06:35,983
all part of a disguise.

114
00:06:36,067 --> 00:06:38,108
Do you think you're fooling
anyone when you have to run off

115
00:06:38,192 --> 00:06:40,400
on missions outside
of your duties...

116
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,108
as my decoy?

117
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,567
Who do you think
you're protecting when you're

118
00:06:43,650 --> 00:06:46,650
playing soldier-boy instead
of covering her full-time?

119
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:49,275
It sounds to me like you
want the best of both worlds,

120
00:06:49,358 --> 00:06:52,233
playing the mercenary hero when
you get "orders" one moment

121
00:06:52,317 --> 00:06:54,400
and playing the
hapless student the next.

122
00:06:54,483 --> 00:06:58,483
So tell me, why aren't you
willing to follow your orders?

123
00:06:58,567 --> 00:07:00,358
No answer, Sagara?

124
00:07:00,442 --> 00:07:03,317
Maybe you just don't
want to know the answer.

125
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:05,525
Not that I care, mind you.

126
00:07:05,608 --> 00:07:07,108
You gripes and complaints,

127
00:07:07,192 --> 00:07:10,108
whether they're with me or with
your orders, make no difference.

128
00:07:10,192 --> 00:07:13,942
You still have to entrust her
care to me and leave Tokyo.

129
00:07:14,025 --> 00:07:17,067
Your being out of the picture
simply means I've lost my decoy

130
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:19,900
and I will spend more time
observing our subject.

131
00:07:19,983 --> 00:07:20,858
Nothing more.

132
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,400
Nothing less.

133
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,608
It's funny you've found fault
with my performance, Sagara,

134
00:07:25,692 --> 00:07:29,150
but do you really think someone
like you can protect her?

135
00:07:29,233 --> 00:07:31,775
Remember that the time
I spend watching her

136
00:07:31,858 --> 00:07:33,692
means watching YOU, too.

137
00:07:33,775 --> 00:07:35,233
In the last six months,

138
00:07:35,317 --> 00:07:38,275
you haven't been able to adjust
to Japanese society at all.

139
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:41,817
And you can't deny you've put
her in danger countless times...

140
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:43,483
through your own mistakes.

141
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:44,733
It seems that your idea

142
00:07:44,817 --> 00:07:48,233
of being a bodyguard
could use some revision.

143
00:07:48,317 --> 00:07:51,358
Calling you "third rate"
would be a compliment.

144
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:54,150
And that's putting it
rather nicely.

145
00:07:54,233 --> 00:07:56,233
You're a pompous son of a bitch!

146
00:07:56,317 --> 00:08:00,192
Well, I must have pushed
the right buttons, eh Sagara?

147
00:08:00,275 --> 00:08:03,900
Either way, Urzu 7, you're done
playing house with that girl.

148
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:05,817
Follow your instructions.

149
00:08:17,608 --> 00:08:18,275
Quack!

150
00:08:18,358 --> 00:08:19,442
It's morning!

151
00:08:19,525 --> 00:08:20,358
Quack!

152
00:08:20,442 --> 00:08:21,858
Get up, Kaname!

153
00:08:21,942 --> 00:08:23,150
Quack!

154
00:09:05,692 --> 00:09:07,275
Good morning, Kyoko!

155
00:09:07,358 --> 00:09:08,775
Good morning, Kaname!

156
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,150
Wow, you certainly
look cheerful today!

157
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:11,692
I do?

158
00:09:11,775 --> 00:09:12,942
Mm--hm!

159
00:09:13,025 --> 00:09:14,733
So did something good
happen to you or what?

160
00:09:14,817 --> 00:09:16,233
No, not really.

161
00:09:16,317 --> 00:09:17,650
Well, maybe.

162
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:20,317
But I wonder if it's even
worth mentioning, though?

163
00:09:21,858 --> 00:09:23,233
You're acting weird.

164
00:09:23,317 --> 00:09:26,108
Anyway, Sousuke was back to
his normal self yesterday,

165
00:09:26,192 --> 00:09:27,317
wasn't he?

166
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,150
I swear, Kyoko,
he's always embarrassing me!

167
00:09:30,233 --> 00:09:32,358
It makes me wanna put a shock
collar around his neck--

168
00:09:32,442 --> 00:09:34,233
you know, try and train him!

169
00:09:34,317 --> 00:09:36,442
And every time he crosses
that line, it's "Zap!

170
00:09:36,525 --> 00:09:39,192
BAD Sousuke! "I guess
that's totally evil of me,

171
00:09:39,275 --> 00:09:41,150
but he DOES deserve it, right?

172
00:09:41,233 --> 00:09:43,442
He's not a dog, Kaname!

173
00:09:43,525 --> 00:09:46,192
Oh, by the way, what happened
after the beauty parlor?

174
00:09:46,275 --> 00:09:46,817
Huh?!

175
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,067
Oh, we went home.

176
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:49,525
Why do you ask?

177
00:09:49,608 --> 00:09:52,025
I just wondered what he's
going to do about a haircut.

178
00:09:52,108 --> 00:09:53,067
Yeah, really.

179
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:54,150
He'll probably
just cut it himself.

180
00:09:54,233 --> 00:09:54,983
No!

181
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:57,025
It'll look all sloppy again!

182
00:09:58,525 --> 00:10:00,817
Great, I'll have to make sure
our stories match up later.

183
00:10:01,817 --> 00:10:03,067
But still,

184
00:10:03,150 --> 00:10:06,108
I think someone is looking
more chipper than usual.

185
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:06,817
Who's that?

186
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,650
YOU, of course!

187
00:10:07,733 --> 00:10:08,525
What?

188
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:10,483
You're just imagining things!

189
00:10:11,817 --> 00:10:13,275
So, what happened, huh?

190
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:14,233
I'm serious!

191
00:10:14,317 --> 00:10:15,942
Nothing happened, okay?

192
00:10:16,025 --> 00:10:18,317
Hey, did you catch
the latest Kumodoshin?

193
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:20,567
Yeah, I saw it.

194
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,775
What'd ya think?

195
00:10:21,858 --> 00:10:23,650
Honestly, it wasn't that great.

196
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:24,192
Huh?

197
00:10:24,275 --> 00:10:25,192
Why not?

198
00:10:25,275 --> 00:10:26,608
Just because...

199
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,275
Well, okay, the octopus
samurai thing was good, but...

200
00:10:29,358 --> 00:10:30,775
Yeah it was!

201
00:10:30,858 --> 00:10:33,025
When all those tentacles and
stuff came out of his back!

202
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,567
That was INSANE!

203
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:38,733
Right.

204
00:10:38,817 --> 00:10:40,108
And then it was over...

205
00:10:40,192 --> 00:10:40,900
I didn't know about it either...

206
00:10:40,983 --> 00:10:42,233
What's the matter?

207
00:10:42,317 --> 00:10:43,692
Oh, nothing.

208
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,525
Oh, yeah, no kidding!

209
00:10:45,608 --> 00:10:46,775
I can't wait til...

210
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:47,983
Good morning, Shinji.

211
00:10:48,067 --> 00:10:49,358
Hey, good morning, Kaname.

212
00:10:49,442 --> 00:10:50,442
Where's Sousuke?

213
00:10:50,525 --> 00:10:51,650
Ummm...

214
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:53,317
You know, I haven't
seen him come in yet.

215
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:55,358
Then I guess he
still hasn't made it.

216
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,692
Okay, good.

217
00:10:57,442 --> 00:10:58,108
What happened?

218
00:10:58,192 --> 00:10:59,400
Oh, nothing!

219
00:11:00,483 --> 00:11:02,400
Hey, Kyoko, what'd I miss?

220
00:11:06,192 --> 00:11:06,983
Good morning!

221
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,567
Oh, good morning!

222
00:11:12,817 --> 00:11:13,817
Oh man!

223
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,233
That was close!

224
00:11:24,275 --> 00:11:25,817
I wonder what he's doing?

225
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:28,525
Rise!

226
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:29,150
And...

227
00:11:29,233 --> 00:11:30,608
Bow!

228
00:11:30,692 --> 00:11:31,983
Good morning, sir!

229
00:11:32,067 --> 00:11:32,650
Good morning.

230
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:33,900
Be seated.

231
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:36,025
Listen for your name.

232
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:37,900
Igarashi...

233
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:38,525
Here.

234
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:39,192
Ishihara?

235
00:11:39,275 --> 00:11:40,233
Here!

236
00:11:40,317 --> 00:11:41,067
Isoumura?

237
00:11:41,150 --> 00:11:41,900
Here.

238
00:11:41,983 --> 00:11:42,775
Uozumi?

239
00:11:42,858 --> 00:11:43,567
Here.

240
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:44,233
Fujida?

241
00:11:44,317 --> 00:11:45,150
Here.

242
00:11:45,233 --> 00:11:45,942
Oumi?

243
00:11:46,025 --> 00:11:47,025
Here.

244
00:11:47,108 --> 00:11:47,900
Ogata?

245
00:11:47,983 --> 00:11:49,067
Here.

246
00:13:38,942 --> 00:13:41,233
Hmmm, no answer?

247
00:13:41,317 --> 00:13:44,317
No, but it didn't go to
voicemail, so it must be on...

248
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,692
I wonder what's wrong?

249
00:13:45,775 --> 00:13:48,692
Heck if I know -- that
idiot could be anywhere!

250
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,275
Orders.

251
00:14:04,192 --> 00:14:05,567
Damn.

252
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:30,067
Damn.

253
00:14:31,442 --> 00:14:33,858
KANAME!

254
00:14:33,942 --> 00:14:36,358
Now my future
is totally hopeless!

255
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,942
It couldn't have been that bad.

256
00:14:38,025 --> 00:14:39,233
Yes it could!

257
00:14:39,317 --> 00:14:42,650
I did lousy on that
Math II test we got back!

258
00:14:42,733 --> 00:14:43,775
It's okay!

259
00:14:43,858 --> 00:14:45,233
It's not like
your life depends on it.

260
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,025
So how did you do, Kaname?

261
00:14:47,108 --> 00:14:48,275
Well, I guess I did...

262
00:14:48,358 --> 00:14:51,150
a little bit better
than average, I suppose.

263
00:14:51,233 --> 00:14:52,192
You're a traitor.

264
00:14:52,275 --> 00:14:53,692
You know that?

265
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:56,150
Hey, I just remembered --
you got the top scores

266
00:14:56,233 --> 00:14:59,233
in last year's science and
math finals too, didn't you?

267
00:14:59,317 --> 00:15:00,483
Mmhmm...

268
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:03,192
Well, it's just one of
those things, you know?

269
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:04,567
Or could being
one of the Whispered

270
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,942
have something to do with it?

271
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,108
Hey, can you help me
get better scores?

272
00:15:08,192 --> 00:15:09,108
Look!

273
00:15:09,192 --> 00:15:10,608
I don't do
anything special, okay?

274
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:14,108
Okay but could you at least
tell me your study secrets?

275
00:15:14,192 --> 00:15:15,233
Could you be cheating?

276
00:15:15,317 --> 00:15:17,067
Oh, I don't care
what it is Kaname,

277
00:15:17,150 --> 00:15:19,858
you just gotta tell me
how you're doing it!

278
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:20,983
I could tell you...

279
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,858
but then I might
have to kill you.

280
00:15:23,942 --> 00:15:25,150
Just kidding!

281
00:15:27,108 --> 00:15:28,275
And by the way,

282
00:15:28,358 --> 00:15:30,567
you know, Sousuke never
made it to class today.

283
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:31,900
Yeah, I noticed.

284
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:34,900
I honestly wonder if
he's trying to fail.

285
00:15:34,983 --> 00:15:37,692
He's already in
big trouble, that idiot.

286
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:42,317
Well, why don't you try
calling Sousuke one more time?

287
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,400
He might pick up, you know.

288
00:15:44,483 --> 00:15:45,817
Hmmm...

289
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:54,608
Apparently, he's gone off and
gotten lost again, as usual,

290
00:15:54,692 --> 00:15:57,525
so I say we oughtta just
move on and forget the doofus!

291
00:15:57,608 --> 00:15:59,067
You sure?

292
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,942
Well I guess if that's what
you really wanna do, Kaname...

293
00:16:02,025 --> 00:16:02,692
Uh--huh.

294
00:16:02,775 --> 00:16:04,275
I do!

295
00:16:04,358 --> 00:16:06,525
And while we're at it, finals
are over so let's have a little

296
00:16:06,608 --> 00:16:09,400
FUN while we still have the
chance, you know what I mean?

297
00:16:09,483 --> 00:16:10,942
Like a karaoke party!

298
00:16:11,025 --> 00:16:12,733
Yeah, that sounds fun!

299
00:16:12,817 --> 00:16:14,775
A careless karaoke
free--for--all...

300
00:16:14,858 --> 00:16:16,233
a ten--hour marathon!

301
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:16,858
Oh...

302
00:16:16,942 --> 00:16:18,150
not again, Kaname!

303
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,192
What?

304
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,067
You had fun last time,
didn't you?

305
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:22,442
Well of course I did,

306
00:16:22,525 --> 00:16:25,150
but after all that, we were
worn out the next day.

307
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,900
You gotta go for it!

308
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:29,858
What good is karoke night if
you don't do it till your ribs

309
00:16:29,942 --> 00:16:32,275
are sore and you
get that feeling of...

310
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:34,900
Are you okay?

311
00:16:34,983 --> 00:16:35,858
It's official!

312
00:16:35,942 --> 00:16:37,775
10--hour karaoke marathon!

313
00:16:37,858 --> 00:16:39,983
And you WILL be singing, Kyoko!

314
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,983
Okay, so who are we
inviting to this thing?

315
00:16:44,067 --> 00:16:48,608
Shiori and Maya and
Ren and Mizuki and...

316
00:16:53,108 --> 00:16:54,650
Huh?

317
00:17:01,733 --> 00:17:02,358
What...

318
00:17:02,442 --> 00:17:03,608
was that?

319
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,275
Kaname?

320
00:17:12,775 --> 00:17:15,067
Hey, what's going on?

321
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:21,025
What is it, Kaname?

322
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:21,983
Hey!

323
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,733
Talk to me!

324
00:17:30,608 --> 00:17:31,317
Kaname...

325
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,525
It's okay, it's okay.

326
00:17:33,608 --> 00:17:36,525
It's okay, it's okay.

327
00:17:36,608 --> 00:17:38,692
The number you have
dialed cannot be reached,

328
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:41,775
as it is out of the service area
or the phone is powered off.

329
00:17:41,858 --> 00:17:43,858
The number you have
dialed cannot be reached,

330
00:17:43,942 --> 00:17:46,608
as it is out of the service
area or the phone is powered--

331
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:52,358
Are you okay?

332
00:17:52,442 --> 00:17:54,108
I'm sorry, I have to go home.

333
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:55,400
No way!

334
00:17:56,983 --> 00:17:59,567
I can't just let you go when
you're all shaken up like this!

335
00:17:59,650 --> 00:18:00,317
I'm fine.

336
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:00,775
But you're...

337
00:18:00,858 --> 00:18:02,150
Drop it!

338
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:05,317
I'm sorry.

339
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:07,233
See you tomorrow.

340
00:18:43,108 --> 00:18:45,275
All right, welcome, everyone!

341
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:47,108
Let's introduce the
guest of the week!

342
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:48,775
The Encores!

343
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,775
Oh, you're looking very fit.

344
00:18:50,858 --> 00:18:53,442
And you look like
you're having a fit!

345
00:18:54,900 --> 00:18:57,192
Oooh, he gotcha
that time, Kenny!

346
00:18:57,275 --> 00:18:58,150
What did you say?

347
00:18:58,233 --> 00:18:59,442
Take this!

348
00:18:59,525 --> 00:19:01,150
Aw, man!

349
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,983
Yeah, how ya like that?

350
00:19:30,192 --> 00:19:31,942
It's okay, nothing's happening.

351
00:19:32,025 --> 00:19:33,692
It's okay, nothing's happening.

352
00:19:33,775 --> 00:19:35,608
It's okay, nothing's happening.

353
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,942
Kaname Chidori speaking.

354
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,567
Hello?

355
00:20:34,817 --> 00:20:36,608
Who is this?

356
00:20:36,692 --> 00:20:37,108
Hey!

357
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,358
Who's there?

358
00:20:45,108 --> 00:20:46,358
Sousuke...

359
00:20:51,608 --> 00:20:52,567
The number you have dialed
cannot be...

360
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,858
Shut up!

361
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:57,692
How...

362
00:20:57,775 --> 00:20:59,650
How am I supposed
to reach you, Sousuke?

363
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:00,192
Oh!

364
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:01,525
The radio setup!

365
00:21:12,233 --> 00:21:15,233
Mithril uses a satellite with
spectrum diffusion modulation

366
00:21:15,317 --> 00:21:18,025
and a unique quantum code.

367
00:21:18,108 --> 00:21:20,442
Thanks to the time I spent
on the Tuatha de Danaan,

368
00:21:20,525 --> 00:21:23,442
I know how it all works and
what frequencies they use!

369
00:21:23,525 --> 00:21:25,067
I can do this...

370
00:21:25,150 --> 00:21:27,150
I know I can!

371
00:21:27,233 --> 00:21:27,775
Sousuke!

372
00:21:27,858 --> 00:21:29,067
Are you in there?!

373
00:21:35,692 --> 00:21:37,400
My notebook...

374
00:21:37,483 --> 00:21:39,775
Why was it left here
on the floor?

375
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,900
Huh?

376
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:09,525
But it can't be...

377
00:23:48,775 --> 00:23:51,317
Frustration,
arguments and tears.

378
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:54,108
Unmitigated hatred rises
within me for the machine

379
00:23:54,192 --> 00:23:55,900
that tore me apart from her.

380
00:23:55,983 --> 00:23:59,067
Little do I know that it will
become a curse on myself.

381
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:00,317
Next time...

382
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,942
"Jungle Groove" Black
and white flashes pierce

383
00:24:03,025 --> 00:24:04,275
through the jungle.
