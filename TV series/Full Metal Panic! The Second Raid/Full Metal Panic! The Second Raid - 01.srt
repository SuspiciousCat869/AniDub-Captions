1
00:02:21,025 --> 00:02:23,650
The scene here in
Taboli City is chaotic.

2
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,317
The Balic Republic's army,
anti-government guerrillas,

3
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,358
and armed militias from other
factions have been fighting

4
00:02:29,442 --> 00:02:32,567
since the breakdown of the
ceasefire agreement yesterday.

5
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:35,733
Witnesses report nurmerous
shootings and acts of cruelty,

6
00:02:35,817 --> 00:02:37,942
making life in
the city very tense.

7
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,608
Also, we've received reports
of nearly 100 refugees stranded

8
00:02:41,692 --> 00:02:44,525
in a medical facility just
outside of the c--

9
00:02:44,608 --> 00:02:45,317
All right,

10
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,775
that should do it.

11
00:03:17,108 --> 00:03:19,358
Al, test the data links.

12
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:20,567
Roger.

13
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,942
ADM, on.

14
00:03:22,025 --> 00:03:23,733
PCL, contact.

15
00:03:23,817 --> 00:03:26,483
Opening from 403 to 412.

16
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:28,692
Commencing TAC transfer.

17
00:03:28,775 --> 00:03:29,567
Complete.

18
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:30,442
Check backup.

19
00:03:30,525 --> 00:03:31,608
Roger.

20
00:03:31,692 --> 00:03:32,858
The observation team

21
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:34,942
says we're running late
for this little party.

22
00:03:35,025 --> 00:03:36,358
Hey, no biggie!

23
00:03:36,442 --> 00:03:38,650
The hero's supposed
to arrive late.

24
00:03:38,733 --> 00:03:41,483
I'm not gonna help if you start
getting shot up, you idiot!

25
00:03:41,567 --> 00:03:43,275
Man, that's cold.

26
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,400
Colonel Maress,
there are only the sick,

27
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:47,483
elderly, and women
and children here.

28
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:50,150
If you have even the
slightest human compassion,

29
00:03:50,233 --> 00:03:52,233
please let us go.

30
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:53,942
Gebo 4 to all units.

31
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,775
We've arrived at Point Echo.

32
00:03:55,858 --> 00:03:57,192
Activating ECS.

33
00:03:57,275 --> 00:03:58,608
Now in stealth mode.

34
00:03:58,692 --> 00:04:00,692
Opening cargo bay hatches.

35
00:04:00,775 --> 00:04:02,358
I, I'm begging you.

36
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:04,275
Perhaps if you reconsider,

37
00:04:04,358 --> 00:04:06,442
God will find it in
his heart--

38
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:08,608
Urzu 2, roger.

39
00:04:08,692 --> 00:04:10,317
Let's move!

40
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,733
I don't give a damn about you
or the god you believe in.

41
00:04:14,817 --> 00:04:16,650
Colonel Maress...

42
00:04:16,733 --> 00:04:17,567
This is Urzu 6.

43
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,483
I'm good to go!

44
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:23,233
Urzu 7- ready to drop.

45
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:25,150
Now die!

46
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:38,983
What the hell?

47
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,400
This is Urzu 6.

48
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,108
I'm in firing position.

49
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:48,900
It's time to party!

50
00:04:55,192 --> 00:04:56,817
All units to
defensive positions!

51
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,692
Red 1 is...

52
00:04:57,775 --> 00:04:59,317
Red 1 is...

53
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,192
Dammit!

54
00:05:00,275 --> 00:05:01,567
Radio and sensors are down.

55
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,317
What's going on?

56
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,692
Are they jamming us?

57
00:05:04,775 --> 00:05:05,483
Arm slave!

58
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:06,483
AS spotted!

59
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:07,858
Gunner, fire at will!

60
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,108
Stay focused!

61
00:05:10,192 --> 00:05:10,983
Close formation!

62
00:05:11,067 --> 00:05:12,192
There aren't that many of them.

63
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:35,442
Colonel Maress, who in the
living hell are those guys?

64
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:37,400
They couldn't
possibly be the rebels!

65
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:38,442
They're Mithril.

66
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:39,650
Mithril?

67
00:05:39,733 --> 00:05:41,192
Heard of 'em before?

68
00:05:41,275 --> 00:05:44,067
There's rumors about an
elusive mercenary force which

69
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,025
doesn't align itself
with any governing body.

70
00:05:47,108 --> 00:05:49,983
They have extraordinary
personnel and weaponry that's

71
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:52,775
10 years in advance
of the rest of the world.

72
00:05:52,858 --> 00:05:56,483
Apparently they're "wannabe"
international peacekeepers.

73
00:05:56,567 --> 00:05:58,900
But I never
thought I'D see 'em...

74
00:05:58,983 --> 00:06:01,192
But why would
they help the refugees?

75
00:06:01,275 --> 00:06:02,400
No idea.

76
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:04,733
But you saw those
AS units, didn't you?

77
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,317
Not even the Americans have
that kind of machinery yet.

78
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,233
It has to be those
Mithril bastards!

79
00:06:10,317 --> 00:06:12,233
We should call
in reinforcements.

80
00:06:12,317 --> 00:06:13,233
Do it now!

81
00:06:13,317 --> 00:06:14,900
Throw everything
we've got at them.

82
00:06:14,983 --> 00:06:16,900
And don't let 'em
get out alive!

83
00:06:16,983 --> 00:06:19,067
OR those heathen refugees!

84
00:06:21,067 --> 00:06:22,733
Mike 13 destroyed.

85
00:06:22,817 --> 00:06:25,067
All hostile targets
have been neutralized.

86
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:26,483
Master mode 6.

87
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:28,525
Keep watching
with active sensors.

88
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:29,733
Roger.

89
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:33,150
Urzu 6, Urzu 7, this is Urzu 2.

90
00:06:33,233 --> 00:06:34,567
Defend the perimeter around

91
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:37,358
the camp and secure a landing
area for the choppers.

92
00:06:37,442 --> 00:06:38,692
Urzu 7, wilco.

93
00:06:38,775 --> 00:06:40,275
Urzu 6, wilco.

94
00:06:42,192 --> 00:06:43,358
This is Gebo 4.

95
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,108
I'm setting down on the L.Z.

96
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,067
And you better
watch my ass, Weber.

97
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:47,900
Heh!

98
00:06:47,983 --> 00:06:49,692
I don't go for GUYs' asses!

99
00:06:49,775 --> 00:06:52,525
Just get movin' and
load up, truck driver!

100
00:06:52,608 --> 00:06:54,233
Yeah, whatever.

101
00:07:03,567 --> 00:07:05,692
We're taking the
wounded onboard first!

102
00:07:05,775 --> 00:07:07,275
All men, help out!

103
00:07:07,358 --> 00:07:08,775
Women and children,

104
00:07:08,858 --> 00:07:11,567
get together and stay there
until further instructions!

105
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:15,192
Man, they're nothing but
old men, old ladies, and kids.

106
00:07:15,275 --> 00:07:18,858
So why does a government's
army waste time attacking them?

107
00:07:18,942 --> 00:07:22,192
Ethnic conflicts can
be like that, Urzu 6.

108
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,358
But in this case,

109
00:07:23,442 --> 00:07:26,025
there are probably
more complicated issues.

110
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,608
Like politics?

111
00:07:27,692 --> 00:07:29,192
Economics, too.

112
00:07:29,275 --> 00:07:31,025
A state like this
deliberately violates

113
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,983
international peace treaties,
giving major world powers an

114
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,317
excuse to "investigate" - and
then decide whom to approach

115
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,067
for under-the-table
deals as to mineral rights,

116
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:42,817
other natural
resources or whatever.

117
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,900
And now we're
a part of that, too...

118
00:07:44,983 --> 00:07:47,650
Absolutely disgusting, isn't it?

119
00:07:47,733 --> 00:07:49,733
But it's still worth it.

120
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,692
Exactly.

121
00:07:51,775 --> 00:07:54,233
Teiwaz 12, situation?

122
00:07:54,317 --> 00:07:55,692
This is Teiwaz 12.

123
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:57,608
We've got two combined-arms
companies approaching from

124
00:07:57,692 --> 00:07:58,775
the northwest.

125
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,025
Near coordinates 36A, 87A.

126
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:05,733
12 AS units, 12 MBTs,
and a lot more out there.

127
00:08:05,817 --> 00:08:07,858
Looks like ya still
got some time, but...

128
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,192
Shit!

129
00:08:13,317 --> 00:08:14,483
It's Triple A!

130
00:08:14,567 --> 00:08:16,108
They fired from the hill
10K to the southwest.

131
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:18,608
I'm hit with damage to the
engine and pressure gauge.

132
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:19,775
Unable to restart.

133
00:08:19,858 --> 00:08:21,483
I'm going in
for a crash landing.

134
00:08:23,275 --> 00:08:25,317
Teiwaz 12, you okay?

135
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:27,525
Teiwaz 12, respond!

136
00:08:27,608 --> 00:08:28,650
Yeah, I...

137
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:29,900
I'm still here...

138
00:08:29,983 --> 00:08:31,942
I'll send you data on
the Triple A position.

139
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:33,733
And we'll scuttle the
chopper and head back...

140
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:38,358
It's an Anti-ECS missile?

141
00:08:38,442 --> 00:08:41,608
Impossible, I didn't know these
guys had that kind of firepower!

142
00:08:41,692 --> 00:08:43,025
Yeah, this is bad.

143
00:08:43,108 --> 00:08:45,358
They're all gonna get shot down.

144
00:08:45,442 --> 00:08:47,400
Urzu 2, we can't take off now!

145
00:08:47,483 --> 00:08:48,733
We reach 150 feet,

146
00:08:48,817 --> 00:08:51,233
and a missile will take us
and the refugees down!

147
00:08:51,317 --> 00:08:54,067
I know, but we have units
advancing on our position.

148
00:08:54,150 --> 00:08:55,858
How are your NOE skills?

149
00:08:55,942 --> 00:08:57,817
Stay low along
alternate route two,

150
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,650
and we'll provide the escort...

151
00:09:01,358 --> 00:09:02,650
DON'T, Sousuke!

152
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:04,567
I'll take out the
anti-air missiles.

153
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,942
What about the rendezvous?

154
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:06,775
Handle it!

155
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:07,942
We can argue about it later.

156
00:09:08,983 --> 00:09:10,108
Understood.

157
00:09:11,525 --> 00:09:15,192
We'll escort the choppers
to coordinates 34B, 99A.

158
00:09:15,275 --> 00:09:16,400
Be careful.

159
00:09:16,483 --> 00:09:17,858
Roger.

160
00:09:17,942 --> 00:09:19,650
We better move it.

161
00:09:19,733 --> 00:09:22,192
Or we'll be boxed-in
and dead in no time.

162
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,150
Report from the
anti-air missile squad.

163
00:09:25,233 --> 00:09:27,275
We've shot down
an enemy chopper.

164
00:09:27,358 --> 00:09:28,150
Good.

165
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:29,733
Keep them pinned down.

166
00:09:30,733 --> 00:09:33,108
If we can attack them while
they're still on the ground,

167
00:09:33,192 --> 00:09:35,317
we'll crush them
with our main troops.

168
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,650
Relay their position
to artillery!

169
00:09:51,567 --> 00:09:52,733
Urzu 7.

170
00:09:52,817 --> 00:09:54,525
I'm near the enemy
triple A battery.

171
00:09:54,608 --> 00:09:55,817
Five more minutes.

172
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:56,817
This is Urzu 2.

173
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:58,233
Moving away from L.Z.

174
00:09:58,317 --> 00:10:00,400
Distance from destination is...

175
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:01,525
Whoa!

176
00:10:01,608 --> 00:10:02,692
That was close.

177
00:10:02,775 --> 00:10:04,108
That was just a greeting.

178
00:10:04,192 --> 00:10:05,483
If we don't move our asses,

179
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,692
they're gonna rain down
artillery on those choppers.

180
00:10:07,775 --> 00:10:10,483
If we don't hurry,
WE'RE gonna be surrounded!

181
00:10:10,567 --> 00:10:13,692
Even our M-9s aren't powerful
enough to handle two companies.

182
00:10:13,775 --> 00:10:14,650
I know.

183
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:15,692
Doesn't look good...

184
00:10:15,775 --> 00:10:17,567
Two enemy AS units spotted.

185
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,108
Bearing 048.

186
00:10:19,192 --> 00:10:20,525
Distance 15.

187
00:10:20,608 --> 00:10:21,233
Damn!

188
00:10:21,317 --> 00:10:22,483
They really are here!

189
00:10:22,567 --> 00:10:23,483
All units, stop.

190
00:10:23,567 --> 00:10:25,025
We've got enemy AS units!

191
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:27,275
Urzu 6, watch 4 o'clock.

192
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:29,025
Urzu 6, roger!

193
00:10:30,108 --> 00:10:32,983
Warning: Two RF missiles
locked on Gebo 4.

194
00:10:33,067 --> 00:10:34,192
ECM ON!

195
00:10:34,275 --> 00:10:35,942
Set the blip enhancer
to maximum power!

196
00:10:36,025 --> 00:10:37,567
Roger.

197
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,150
We're getting our butts
shot off out here!

198
00:10:44,233 --> 00:10:45,233
How are things over there?

199
00:10:45,317 --> 00:10:46,108
Almost done.

200
00:10:46,192 --> 00:10:47,483
All that's left is...

201
00:10:47,567 --> 00:10:48,567
Contact!

202
00:10:57,817 --> 00:11:00,567
Enemy batteries and
radar have been destroyed.

203
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,233
Escape through the hole
in their anti-air net.

204
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:04,858
All Gebo units,
did you hear that?

205
00:11:04,942 --> 00:11:06,733
We're pulling
out of here immediately.

206
00:11:06,817 --> 00:11:08,275
Roger.

207
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,608
Urzu 2 and Urzu 6, hurry up and
dock for transport choppers.

208
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:12,525
What about Urzu 7?

209
00:11:12,608 --> 00:11:14,192
We don't have the fuel
or the time for that!

210
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,567
And their anti-air radar
could be back up any minute!

211
00:11:20,025 --> 00:11:22,358
Continue the extraction
and don't worry about me.

212
00:11:22,442 --> 00:11:23,942
I'm heading to the
alternate escape route

213
00:11:24,025 --> 00:11:25,858
and I'll get out on my own.

214
00:11:25,942 --> 00:11:27,192
You can handle it, right?

215
00:11:27,275 --> 00:11:28,525
Affirmative.

216
00:11:28,608 --> 00:11:30,275
I have to hand in a homework
assignment tomorrow.

217
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,942
So I can't die now.

218
00:11:33,608 --> 00:11:34,317
Okay.

219
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:35,942
We'll meet at the Danaan.

220
00:11:36,025 --> 00:11:36,650
Roger.

221
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:37,692
Listen up!

222
00:11:37,775 --> 00:11:39,608
We're pulling out!

223
00:11:39,692 --> 00:11:41,692
We always end up
dropping our pants,

224
00:11:41,775 --> 00:11:43,650
mooning them and
then running away.

225
00:11:43,733 --> 00:11:44,983
How uncool.

226
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:07,525
Gold 2 to all units.

227
00:12:07,608 --> 00:12:10,358
The enemy AS is heading
South down Revolution Street.

228
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:13,400
Set up a blockade at
Point oh-three-twenty one.

229
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:14,900
Blue 1, acknowledged.

230
00:12:14,983 --> 00:12:17,150
Blue 1 to all Blue Team units.

231
00:12:17,233 --> 00:12:19,192
Form two lines and
await further orders.

232
00:12:19,275 --> 00:12:21,275
Permission to fire at will.

233
00:12:21,358 --> 00:12:22,442
Perfect.

234
00:12:22,525 --> 00:12:25,025
Don't let that
white arm slave get away!

235
00:12:29,525 --> 00:12:31,233
Shot cannon ammunition: zero.

236
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:32,108
I know that.

237
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:32,983
Missile warning.

238
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:35,108
Bearing one-two-eight.

239
00:12:40,067 --> 00:12:40,608
Warning.

240
00:12:40,692 --> 00:12:42,025
Main Battle Tank.

241
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,358
What in the hell was that?

242
00:13:06,442 --> 00:13:07,108
Success.

243
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:08,108
The Lambda Driver is...

244
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:08,858
Talk later.

245
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:09,525
Damage report!

246
00:13:09,608 --> 00:13:10,692
Now!

247
00:13:10,775 --> 00:13:12,942
Class B damage to
the right shoulder.

248
00:13:13,025 --> 00:13:14,817
Stabilizers have malfunctioned.

249
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:17,192
Critical errors in
the targeting system.

250
00:13:17,275 --> 00:13:19,317
Urzu 2, this is Urzu 7.

251
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,525
Due to enemy presence,

252
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,650
I've abandoned the
alternate escape route.

253
00:13:22,733 --> 00:13:25,483
I've taken only minor damage,
but I'm getting surrounded.

254
00:13:25,567 --> 00:13:27,358
I don't have much
ammo left, either.

255
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,817
Urzu 2, do you copy?

256
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:33,608
This is Urzu 7.

257
00:13:33,692 --> 00:13:34,483
Please respond...

258
00:13:34,567 --> 00:13:36,233
This is the Tuatha de Danaan.

259
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:37,942
Teletha Testerossa speaking.

260
00:13:38,025 --> 00:13:39,483
Urzu 7, do you read me?

261
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,567
The Captain?

262
00:13:40,650 --> 00:13:42,733
I have transport
helicopters standing by

263
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:44,900
under a communications blackout.

264
00:13:44,983 --> 00:13:48,775
Please follow my directions
to the escape route, Mr. Sagara.

265
00:13:48,858 --> 00:13:49,608
Roger.

266
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:51,358
I must apologize, ma'am.

267
00:13:51,442 --> 00:13:52,608
Enemy troops are stronger

268
00:13:52,692 --> 00:13:55,483
than my assessment and
I'm cut off from escape.

269
00:13:55,567 --> 00:13:58,108
No, I don't think
that's quite true...

270
00:13:58,192 --> 00:14:00,108
I've transmitted
the data to you.

271
00:14:00,192 --> 00:14:02,442
Please move to
the marked position.

272
00:14:02,525 --> 00:14:03,608
That position?

273
00:14:03,692 --> 00:14:04,858
That's running
right into the enemy!

274
00:14:04,942 --> 00:14:06,817
It's okay, hurry up!

275
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,733
Roger.

276
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:09,025
Over and out.

277
00:14:11,525 --> 00:14:12,317
8 knots.

278
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,442
Depth, one-hundred.

279
00:14:13,525 --> 00:14:15,067
We've reached
the target location.

280
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,025
Very well.

281
00:14:16,108 --> 00:14:18,525
Put the EMFC into "active" mode.

282
00:14:18,608 --> 00:14:20,983
Pivot 180 degrees and hold.

283
00:14:21,067 --> 00:14:21,858
Aye, ma'am.

284
00:14:21,942 --> 00:14:23,567
EMFC active.

285
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:26,358
Helmsman, make
your course 1-2-7.

286
00:14:26,442 --> 00:14:30,775
Answering EMFC active; Coming
about to course 1-2-7, aye.

287
00:14:30,858 --> 00:14:32,608
Please brace for impact.

288
00:14:32,692 --> 00:14:36,108
Mr. Mardukas, all ahead
full - on my signal.

289
00:14:36,192 --> 00:14:37,400
Aye, Captain.

290
00:14:38,858 --> 00:14:41,983
Enemy AS is heading from
Anton Street to Uthro Bridge.

291
00:14:42,983 --> 00:14:44,775
Trapped like a rat.

292
00:14:44,858 --> 00:14:48,525
It's payback time for destroying
all my precious weapons.

293
00:14:48,608 --> 00:14:51,025
TDDHQ, this is Urzu 7.

294
00:14:51,108 --> 00:14:53,067
2 minutes from target location.

295
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:00,358
Playing cat-and-mouse...

296
00:15:00,442 --> 00:15:01,567
Warning.

297
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:03,608
Arm slave and fighting
vehicle dead ahead.

298
00:15:03,692 --> 00:15:04,650
Distance 5.

299
00:15:10,983 --> 00:15:12,858
Chain gun ammunition zero.

300
00:15:23,858 --> 00:15:25,983
Target location reached.

301
00:15:28,775 --> 00:15:31,317
This is the 3rd
Combined Armored Company.

302
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,942
Silver Team and Copper Team,
Green Team and Yellow Team,

303
00:15:35,025 --> 00:15:36,483
formation complete!

304
00:15:36,567 --> 00:15:38,817
Ready and waiting.

305
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,733
This is the 8th
Combined Armored Company.

306
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:43,608
Gold Team and Platinum Team,
Blue Team and Purple Team,

307
00:15:43,692 --> 00:15:44,817
formation complete!

308
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:46,775
Sniping team in position.

309
00:15:46,858 --> 00:15:48,983
All troops are
in position, Colonel.

310
00:15:49,067 --> 00:15:49,983
Good!

311
00:15:50,067 --> 00:15:51,192
This is Urzu 7.

312
00:15:51,275 --> 00:15:52,983
I am surrounded
by enemy forces.

313
00:15:53,067 --> 00:15:54,025
No ammo.

314
00:15:54,108 --> 00:15:55,442
Escape impossible.

315
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:58,150
Abandonment and self-destruct
protocol recommended.

316
00:15:58,233 --> 00:15:58,983
Denied.

317
00:15:59,067 --> 00:16:00,567
I'll lose my school credits.

318
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,983
Attention Arm Slave Pilot.

319
00:16:03,067 --> 00:16:05,608
Attention Arm Slave Pilot.

320
00:16:05,692 --> 00:16:07,983
You are completely surrounded!

321
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,567
Emergency blow!

322
00:16:09,650 --> 00:16:10,400
Aye, Ma'am.

323
00:16:10,483 --> 00:16:11,650
Emergency Blow.

324
00:16:11,733 --> 00:16:12,942

00:16:13,025 --> 00:16:15,358
Uptrim 5 degrees.

326
00:16:15,442 --> 00:16:17,275
Counting down!

Four!

334
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,150
Three!

335
00:16:25,233 --> 00:16:26,233
Two!

336
00:16:26,317 --> 00:16:27,483
One!

337
00:16:28,067 --> 00:16:29,108
What?!

338
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,150
The Arbalest has been recovered.

339
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:42,608
Let's shake them up a little.

340
00:16:42,692 --> 00:16:44,275
SUBLAR batteries engage!

341
00:16:44,983 --> 00:16:45,567
Roger.

342
00:16:45,650 --> 00:16:46,692
Launch all SUBLARS!

343
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:48,900
Launching all SUBLARS.

344
00:16:48,983 --> 00:16:49,858
Aye!

345
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:51,692
Hold speed for crash dive!

346
00:16:51,775 --> 00:16:52,608
Aye, Captain.

347
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,150
Set for crash dive!

348
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:19,317
Is that an...

349
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,525
amphibious submarine?!

350
00:17:21,608 --> 00:17:22,858
Impossible!

351
00:17:22,942 --> 00:17:25,192
Who the hell ARE those guys?

352
00:17:43,608 --> 00:17:45,400
"Ii kuni tsukurou."

353
00:17:49,817 --> 00:17:52,567
"Ii kuni tsukurou."

354
00:17:52,650 --> 00:17:53,483
Muromachi shogunate...

355
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,442
It's the Kamakura!

356
00:17:57,775 --> 00:17:59,942
That's a junior
high school question!

357
00:18:00,025 --> 00:18:02,900
How do you expect to pass
the class like that, Sousuke?

358
00:18:02,983 --> 00:18:04,650
I'm bad at Japanese history.

359
00:18:04,733 --> 00:18:06,692
...and Modern
Literature and Classics.

360
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:10,442
And for Pete's sake, stop doing
your homework after a mission!

361
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:11,983
Come on!

362
00:18:12,067 --> 00:18:13,400
You just did something like
straight out of a Bond movie

363
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:15,025
and now you wanna study?

364
00:18:15,108 --> 00:18:16,317
That's lame!

365
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,775
I'd fail otherwise.

366
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,525
Just do what I used to do!

367
00:18:19,608 --> 00:18:22,358
Slap that homework together
at the last minute.

368
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:23,692
Kurz.

369
00:18:23,775 --> 00:18:25,233
You sure talk
pretty big for someone

370
00:18:25,317 --> 00:18:27,108
who hasn't written
his OWN report!

371
00:18:27,192 --> 00:18:28,608
Oh, you mean this week's?

372
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:30,233
And last week's too.

373
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,733
The logistics unit
keeps bugging me about it.

374
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:35,900
Try putting yourself
in my shoes for once.

375
00:18:35,983 --> 00:18:37,067
Oh, yeah...

376
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:39,983
It must be difficult
for "Big Sis" Mao...

377
00:18:40,067 --> 00:18:42,983
It's your fault they're
riding my ass, so DO IT!

378
00:18:43,817 --> 00:18:45,108
That tickles...

379
00:18:52,483 --> 00:18:55,150
We've just passed
15 degrees North latitude.

380
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:58,108
No ships spotted
within a 30 mile radius.

381
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:02,650
Set the alert condition
to Yellow Three.

382
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,233
Executive Officer,
you have the watch.

383
00:19:05,317 --> 00:19:06,317
Yes, ma'am.

384
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,775
Setting alert
condition to Yellow 3.

385
00:19:08,858 --> 00:19:10,442
X-O now on watch.

386
00:19:29,358 --> 00:19:30,608
Mr. Sagara?

387
00:19:30,692 --> 00:19:32,150
Oh, Captain!

388
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:34,108
Oh, no, you don't
have to get up.

389
00:19:34,192 --> 00:19:36,192
I only stopped by
to eat some dinner.

390
00:19:36,275 --> 00:19:37,067
But I...

391
00:19:37,150 --> 00:19:39,400
Don't worry about it.

392
00:19:39,483 --> 00:19:40,483
Ma'am.

393
00:19:43,817 --> 00:19:44,400
Homework?

394
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:45,400
Yes, ma'am.

395
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:46,858
So is it difficult?

396
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:47,900
Yes, ma'am.

397
00:19:47,983 --> 00:19:49,483
To me anyway.

398
00:19:49,567 --> 00:19:51,400
Well, you know
I could tutor you...

399
00:19:51,483 --> 00:19:52,775
NO!

400
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:54,692
I could never ask the
captain to do such a thing!

401
00:19:54,775 --> 00:19:55,942
Just kidding.

402
00:19:56,025 --> 00:19:59,358
I knew that you would
say something like that.

403
00:19:59,442 --> 00:20:01,608
But it does look difficult.

404
00:20:01,692 --> 00:20:02,275
It's...

405
00:20:02,358 --> 00:20:04,150
part of my mission.

406
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,567
Mission...

407
00:20:11,192 --> 00:20:12,483
Captain.

408
00:20:12,567 --> 00:20:14,442
Thank you for what
you did for me.

409
00:20:14,525 --> 00:20:16,942
You saved my life today.

410
00:20:17,025 --> 00:20:17,775
That's...

411
00:20:17,858 --> 00:20:19,733
part of MY mission.

412
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,442
HE'S LATE!!!

413
00:20:22,525 --> 00:20:23,942
What is that idiot thinking,

414
00:20:24,025 --> 00:20:26,733
being completely out of
reach two days straight?!

415
00:20:26,817 --> 00:20:28,983
He still has the
notes I let him borrow!

416
00:20:29,067 --> 00:20:30,275
I couldn't do my homework!

417
00:20:30,358 --> 00:20:31,692
I'm gonna KILL him!

418
00:20:31,775 --> 00:20:33,192
Take it easy, Kaname!

419
00:20:33,275 --> 00:20:35,358
I'm sure Sousuke
has his reasons.

420
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,567
We should give him
a warm welcome back.

421
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:38,567
Not a chance!

422
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,983
He does this every time!

423
00:20:40,067 --> 00:20:42,108
Oh, hello Sousuke.

424
00:20:42,192 --> 00:20:42,900
Sousuke!

425
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:45,442
Give me my notes back now!

426
00:20:45,525 --> 00:20:46,400
What?

427
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:47,442
I'm sorry, Chidori.

428
00:20:47,525 --> 00:20:48,733
I forgot to bring them back.

429
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:49,858
Forgot?

430
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,067
AGAIN?!

431
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:52,442
Then go back and get them!

432
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:53,733
They're in your room, right?

433
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:54,317
I can't.

434
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,733
Why not?!

435
00:20:55,817 --> 00:20:58,108
Because I left them in a
submarine 2000 kilometers from--

436
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:05,442
This is what Balic forces
shot down Teiwaz 12 with.

437
00:21:05,525 --> 00:21:07,567
It's an improved
version of the Patriot.

438
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,525
And it's loaded
with a powerful ECCS.

439
00:21:10,608 --> 00:21:12,358
This means that
all things being equal,

440
00:21:12,442 --> 00:21:15,192
our systems will be
ineffective against them.

441
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:18,358
As of right now, only a limited
number of advanced countries

442
00:21:18,442 --> 00:21:19,858
have this kind of missile.

443
00:21:19,942 --> 00:21:22,650
But the Army of the Balic
Government had those missiles.

444
00:21:22,733 --> 00:21:25,233
So how do you think we should
interpret this development,

445
00:21:25,317 --> 00:21:26,817
Commander Kalinin?

446
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:30,150
The assumption is that a very
powerful outside organization

447
00:21:30,233 --> 00:21:32,483
independently supplied
them with the missiles.

448
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,775
Impressive resources
for an independent.

449
00:21:34,858 --> 00:21:36,317
Right.

450
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,692
And there's also a distinct
possibility that they acquired

451
00:21:38,775 --> 00:21:42,275
the missile system anticipating
our intervention in this matter.

452
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:44,608
So they have an
intelligence network?

453
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:45,983
Correct.

454
00:21:46,067 --> 00:21:48,608
And the seajacking incident
may have been a source.

455
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:50,608
Of course, I doubt the
enemy is in a position

456
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:53,983
to freely detect all of
our movements, but still...

457
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:55,025
They're dangerous.

458
00:21:55,108 --> 00:21:56,525
Indeed.

459
00:21:56,608 --> 00:21:58,608
Essentially, we've got to
be more diligent and cautious

460
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:00,067
in future operations.

461
00:22:00,150 --> 00:22:01,067
Or otherwise...

462
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,233
I know.

463
00:22:04,483 --> 00:22:05,692
The alternative is...

464
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:07,733
we all die.

465
00:23:48,942 --> 00:23:50,650
A typical day in Tokyo.

466
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:52,192
But I didn't yet know
that in the shadows

467
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:55,067
of that ephemeral peace, the
wheels of a vast conspiracy

468
00:23:55,150 --> 00:23:56,858
had started to move.

469
00:23:56,942 --> 00:24:00,400
Next time: "The Situation
Beneath the Surface."

470
00:24:00,483 --> 00:24:03,983
Dangerous people gather,
drawn by the smell of gunpowder.
