1
00:02:00,317 --> 00:02:01,067
Quack!

2
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,275
It's morning!

3
00:02:02,358 --> 00:02:03,192
Quack!

4
00:02:03,275 --> 00:02:04,900
Get up, Kaname!

5
00:02:04,983 --> 00:02:05,817
Quack!

6
00:02:05,900 --> 00:02:07,192
It's morning!

7
00:02:07,275 --> 00:02:08,150
Quack!

8
00:02:08,233 --> 00:02:09,275
Wake up!

9
00:02:09,358 --> 00:02:11,233
If you don't, you'll be late!

10
00:02:11,317 --> 00:02:12,692
Quack!

11
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:40,608
Oww...

12
00:02:53,442 --> 00:02:54,817
Have a look at this.

13
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:57,442
This is from a certain
operation which Sergeant Sagara

14
00:02:57,525 --> 00:02:58,858
took part in.

15
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:01,608
It's an AS unit which
we've fought with previously.

16
00:03:01,692 --> 00:03:03,567
Code name "Venom".

17
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:06,900
Pay particular
attention to this...

18
00:03:08,108 --> 00:03:11,442
As it emits this light, some
sort of energy field renders

19
00:03:11,525 --> 00:03:16,025
all incoming firepower
against it virtually useless.

20
00:03:16,108 --> 00:03:19,817
A device known as the
"Lambda Driver" is responsible.

21
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:23,233
It's probably almost the same
as what's installed on board...

22
00:03:23,317 --> 00:03:25,275
Sergeant Sagara's Arbalest.

23
00:03:25,358 --> 00:03:26,150
Commander!

24
00:03:26,233 --> 00:03:28,233
Yes, what is it, Sergeant Weber?

25
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,483
What the heck
is "Lambda Driver"?

26
00:03:30,567 --> 00:03:34,358
For that explanation, I'll turn
this over to Captain Testarossa.

27
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,483
Because this information was
classified, I could not give you

28
00:03:39,567 --> 00:03:42,192
a clear explanation of
the Lambda Driver before,

29
00:03:42,275 --> 00:03:45,358
but it seems that the
situation has changed.

30
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,817
The Lambda Driver is
a device also known as a

31
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:52,025
"Hidden--String Repulsion
Field Generation System."

32
00:03:52,108 --> 00:03:53,567
In other words...

33
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:57,067
In plain terms, it is a device
which transforms the user's

34
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,858
mental image directly
into physical power.

35
00:03:59,942 --> 00:04:04,317
For example, it can deflect
a bullet or destroy a target.

36
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,358
Aw, c'mon --
that's just impossible!

37
00:04:05,442 --> 00:04:08,400
Oh, so you think
I'm joking, do you?

38
00:04:08,483 --> 00:04:09,733
I have a question!

39
00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:11,650
Go ahead, Sergeant Major.

40
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:13,817
If it's that
versatile and powerful,

41
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,983
how come Sousuke
hardly ever uses it?

42
00:04:16,067 --> 00:04:19,358
I mean, I don't think I've
ever even seen him deploy it.

43
00:04:20,775 --> 00:04:23,025
The fact that it's powered
by the operator's own force

44
00:04:23,108 --> 00:04:24,775
of will is the very
same thing that makes

45
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,983
this weapon system unstable.

46
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:29,067
And because it reflects
the operator's will and

47
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:32,358
his overall mental condition,
using the Lambda Driver always

48
00:04:32,442 --> 00:04:36,150
requires tremendous focus,
discipline, and concentration.

49
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:37,733
It's unstable?

50
00:04:37,817 --> 00:04:40,067
It's the kind of device
which will activate only in

51
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,900
extreme situations, such as when
the pilot's life is in danger.

52
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:46,358
So if things don't get to
that kind of critical level,

53
00:04:46,442 --> 00:04:48,025
it ends in a misfire?

54
00:04:48,108 --> 00:04:50,108
Yes, that's correct.

55
00:04:50,192 --> 00:04:53,025
The enemies I fought before
seemed to have complete control

56
00:04:53,108 --> 00:04:55,567
of their Lambda
Driver technology.

57
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:57,733
How can THEY
manage that, Captain?

58
00:04:57,817 --> 00:05:00,942
Well I can't say for certain,
but they've either had some sort

59
00:05:01,025 --> 00:05:04,900
of extreme training, or they're
using some kind of drugs to

60
00:05:04,983 --> 00:05:07,525
artificially create and
sustain this mental state

61
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,817
in their soldiers.

62
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,025
Ma'am...

63
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,358
Yes, Corporal Yang?

64
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:13,275
Are there machines other
than the Arbalest equipped

65
00:05:13,358 --> 00:05:14,733
with the Lambda Driver?

66
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,900
We would like to further
research and develop

67
00:05:17,983 --> 00:05:21,567
new technologies within Mithril
as well, but the reality is that

68
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:24,400
due to various circumstances,
there are no plans for it

69
00:05:24,483 --> 00:05:26,025
at this time, corporal.

70
00:05:26,108 --> 00:05:27,400
In other words,

71
00:05:27,483 --> 00:05:29,400
you're saying only Sergeant
Sagara can fight them?

72
00:05:29,483 --> 00:05:31,858
No, that's not necessarily
the case, either.

73
00:05:31,942 --> 00:05:34,692
However, if we do fight
them without Lambda Drivers,

74
00:05:34,775 --> 00:05:37,233
we shouldn't be surprised
if we sustain a large number

75
00:05:37,317 --> 00:05:39,608
of casualties on
the battlefield.

76
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,692
Knock off the chatter!

77
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,817
We are currently researching
other technologies

78
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,275
to counter the Lambda Driver.

79
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:48,900
And once we receive a report,
you will be informed.

80
00:05:48,983 --> 00:05:49,733
That is all.

81
00:05:49,817 --> 00:05:50,983
Dismissed.

82
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:54,067
Captain.

83
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:55,525
Yes, Commander?

84
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:57,733
We've just received a report
written by Sergeant Sagara

85
00:05:57,817 --> 00:05:59,483
concerning Wraith.

86
00:05:59,567 --> 00:06:00,900
Goodness, again?

87
00:06:00,983 --> 00:06:02,233
Understood, Commander.

88
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,317
I'll look it over ASAP.

89
00:06:06,858 --> 00:06:08,817
Bodyguard mission, huh?

90
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,942
And now that we don't even know
who is targeting Miss Chidori,

91
00:06:12,025 --> 00:06:14,442
we may not be prepared
with only Sergeant Sagara

92
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,233
and Wraith protecting her...

93
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:18,775
But there's only so many
people we can spare to protect

94
00:06:18,858 --> 00:06:20,567
a Whispered like her.

95
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:24,233
Still, that doesn't mean we can
let the enemy have any more

96
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:26,567
knowledge of the
Black Technology that

97
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:29,025
the Whispereds possess.

98
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:32,400
Whispered...

99
00:06:33,733 --> 00:06:37,192
If only Kaname and I
couldn't hear that voice...

100
00:06:37,275 --> 00:06:41,358
I wonder if we could have lived
our lives as normal girls...

101
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,442
Good morning, Kaname!

102
00:06:45,525 --> 00:06:46,650
Oh, good morning.

103
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,525
Hey, hey, take a look at this!

104
00:06:48,608 --> 00:06:50,983
I found this fun site
on the web yesterday!

105
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:51,525
See?

106
00:06:51,608 --> 00:06:53,358
What is it?

107
00:06:53,442 --> 00:06:54,483
O--kay...

108
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,775
Hey, what happened?

109
00:06:59,858 --> 00:07:00,942
My test data...

110
00:07:01,025 --> 00:07:02,942
My test data!

111
00:07:03,025 --> 00:07:07,025
I worked three hard days to
compile that damn spreadsheet!

112
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:09,858
I wonder what's the matter?

113
00:07:16,025 --> 00:07:17,900
Hey, there's
something on the roof.

114
00:07:17,983 --> 00:07:19,192
Whoa, you're right!

115
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:20,525
Dude, it's huge!

116
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,275
What the hell is it?

117
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,358
Hey, where'ya goin?

118
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:30,442
Oh, Chidori!

119
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:31,733
Take a look at this radar.

120
00:07:31,817 --> 00:07:32,942
Now we have good air def----.

121
00:07:33,983 --> 00:07:35,567
Turn that thing off right now!

122
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:36,608
What was that for?

123
00:07:36,692 --> 00:07:37,275
It was...

124
00:07:37,358 --> 00:07:38,525
painful.

125
00:07:41,317 --> 00:07:42,233
Sousuke...

126
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:43,025
Honestly!

127
00:07:43,108 --> 00:07:44,400
That doofus never gets it!

128
00:07:44,483 --> 00:07:45,608
Now, now.

129
00:07:45,692 --> 00:07:48,525
Sousuke realizes what
he did was wrong...

130
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:49,650
Hey, Sousuke...

131
00:07:49,733 --> 00:07:50,733
What is it, Kazama?

132
00:07:50,817 --> 00:07:52,275
Sorry to bother you like this,

133
00:07:52,358 --> 00:07:54,942
but could you take a look
at this website I found?

134
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,358
It's some kind of forum.

135
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:01,275
Those pictures have
been up since last night.

136
00:08:01,358 --> 00:08:03,192
But I don't know how
they got a hold of them.

137
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:04,400
This is bad.

138
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,692
It could reveal her
position to the enemy.

139
00:08:06,775 --> 00:08:09,650
We should find the culprit
quickly and stop him before he.

140
00:08:09,733 --> 00:08:10,567
Sousuke!

141
00:08:11,858 --> 00:08:12,692
What do you want?

142
00:08:12,775 --> 00:08:13,692
It--It's nothing really.

143
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:14,692
Don't worry about it.

144
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:15,983
What's wrong, Kazama?

145
00:08:16,067 --> 00:08:17,942
I don't think you
should tell the victim.

146
00:08:18,025 --> 00:08:19,942
I'm pretty sure that
it would hurt her feelings.

147
00:08:20,025 --> 00:08:20,733
You think so?

148
00:08:20,817 --> 00:08:22,108
Well, if you ask me,

149
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:23,567
we have to find a way
that we can do it without...

150
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:26,400
Wanna tell me what you two
losers are whispering about?

151
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,108
N--N--N--Nothing at all!

152
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,483
You can just carry on enjoying
your usual high school life

153
00:08:30,567 --> 00:08:32,692
to your heart's utmost content!

154
00:08:32,775 --> 00:08:35,400
Oh yeah, like that
wasn't suspicious...

155
00:08:49,942 --> 00:08:53,358
Big Sis, how is Sensei doing?

156
00:08:53,442 --> 00:08:54,983
He's stabilized a little.

157
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:57,442
The medicine seems
to have started working.

158
00:09:02,733 --> 00:09:03,942
Oh yeah...

159
00:09:04,025 --> 00:09:05,442
What is it?

160
00:09:05,525 --> 00:09:08,025
We're out of bandages.

161
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:10,608
So we'll have to go out
and buy some later.

162
00:09:10,692 --> 00:09:12,275
Let me take care of it.

163
00:09:12,358 --> 00:09:13,942
Well...

164
00:09:14,025 --> 00:09:15,358
In that case,

165
00:09:15,442 --> 00:09:18,108
I guess I'll take care of
wiping down Sensei's body.

166
00:09:26,775 --> 00:09:30,317
I wonder if Sensei's
going to live through this.

167
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:35,108
But Sis...

168
00:09:37,525 --> 00:09:38,192
For now...

169
00:09:38,275 --> 00:09:40,192
let's just be happy.

170
00:09:40,275 --> 00:09:41,775
Happy about what?

171
00:09:41,858 --> 00:09:44,942
That we get to see
our Sensei again.

172
00:09:45,025 --> 00:09:46,900
Aren't you happy?

173
00:09:46,983 --> 00:09:47,900
Yeah.

174
00:09:48,858 --> 00:09:50,317
I suppose...

175
00:10:01,025 --> 00:10:02,275
Another job.

176
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,608
I really hate that man.

177
00:10:08,692 --> 00:10:09,733
Bear with it.

178
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:12,817
It'll be fine.

179
00:10:25,483 --> 00:10:26,733
What's he doing?

180
00:10:26,817 --> 00:10:28,192
Hey, Chidori.

181
00:10:28,275 --> 00:10:30,733
Here's the CD you said you
wanted to check out before.

182
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,442
What the hell are
you DOING, Sousuke?!

183
00:10:36,233 --> 00:10:37,233
Not a problem.

184
00:10:37,317 --> 00:10:38,983
BIG problem!

185
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,567
Oh, Chidori.

186
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,108
About that report
the other day...

187
00:10:44,025 --> 00:10:45,150
Don't struggle!

188
00:10:48,525 --> 00:10:49,525
Not a problem.

189
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:50,983
REALLY big problem!

190
00:10:51,775 --> 00:10:55,192
So, you're dead set on
following me into the restroom?

191
00:10:55,275 --> 00:10:55,858
Shouldn't I?

192
00:10:55,942 --> 00:10:57,108
Of course not!

193
00:10:57,192 --> 00:10:58,692
Why the hell would
I want you to wait for me

194
00:10:58,775 --> 00:11:00,775
in the girls' restroom in front
of the toilet stall, Sousuke??

195
00:11:00,858 --> 00:11:01,400
But it's not a problem.

196
00:11:01,483 --> 00:11:03,192
Stop saying that!

197
00:11:04,858 --> 00:11:06,650
If that's the case then I think
you should at least let me

198
00:11:06,733 --> 00:11:08,483
conduct a thorough
inspection of the stall

199
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,233
before and after you...

200
00:11:11,817 --> 00:11:12,983
You filthy pervert!

201
00:11:13,067 --> 00:11:13,733
Take this!

202
00:11:13,817 --> 00:11:14,358
And this!

203
00:11:14,442 --> 00:11:15,442
And this!

204
00:11:15,525 --> 00:11:15,775
And this!

205
00:11:15,858 --> 00:11:16,317
Huh?

206
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,150
You like that?!

207
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,483
Sousuke's acting a little
strange today, isn't he?

208
00:11:21,567 --> 00:11:24,692
It really creeps me out when
he hangs all over me like that.

209
00:11:24,775 --> 00:11:27,317
But we've seen it
before, remember?

210
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,233
What do you mean?

211
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,067
It's typical Sousuke.

212
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:31,358
It's like how he acted when

213
00:11:31,442 --> 00:11:33,483
he first started
going to school here.

214
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,733
Oh, well...

215
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:36,358
Hey, what do you think
you're doing in here?

216
00:11:36,442 --> 00:11:37,233
What's the matter?

217
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:38,108
Don't give me that!

218
00:11:38,192 --> 00:11:38,942
Answer me!

219
00:11:39,025 --> 00:11:39,942
What are you doing in here?

220
00:11:40,025 --> 00:11:40,525
Investigating.

221
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,192
Huh?

222
00:11:41,275 --> 00:11:41,817
Investigating WHAT?

223
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:42,483
Look, just...

224
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:43,650
Don't move a muscle!

225
00:11:46,817 --> 00:11:47,858
Up there.

226
00:11:48,650 --> 00:11:49,275
Huh?

227
00:11:49,358 --> 00:11:50,483
What do you mean?

228
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:52,233
Cut it out!

229
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:54,317
Hey!

230
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,692
Don't break it!

231
00:12:00,608 --> 00:12:01,275
No!

232
00:12:01,358 --> 00:12:03,192
My computer!

233
00:12:03,275 --> 00:12:04,525
Oh--come--ON!

234
00:12:04,608 --> 00:12:07,608
Why does he always have
to screw up everything?!

235
00:12:19,817 --> 00:12:23,108
So that's the equipment
they left behind, eh?

236
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,442
Has to be Mithril.

237
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:27,858
Well, I wouldn't
necessarily say that...

238
00:12:27,942 --> 00:12:29,317
Take us south.

239
00:12:34,233 --> 00:12:35,650
M9 tracks.

240
00:12:35,733 --> 00:12:38,192
Looks like at least three
different sets of footprints.

241
00:12:38,275 --> 00:12:40,233
But that's unconfirmed.

242
00:12:40,317 --> 00:12:43,108
They parachuted in,
destroyed all hostile targets,

243
00:12:43,192 --> 00:12:45,817
took out the anti--aircraft
bunkers and retreated.

244
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:48,108
Or their rendezvous was changed?

245
00:12:48,192 --> 00:12:49,525
One of them separated

246
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,983
from his cohorts and took
off in the direction of...

247
00:12:53,067 --> 00:12:55,108
I'm gonna say anti--
air batteries.

248
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:57,942
There's no way of
confirming that from here.

249
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,108
The bastard deflected
direct fire from a tank.

250
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:06,442
That would be impossible
without a Lambda Driver.

251
00:13:06,525 --> 00:13:08,900
Sir, I can't draw
those conclusions.

252
00:13:08,983 --> 00:13:12,275
There's no doubt in my mind
it's their white AS.

253
00:13:13,442 --> 00:13:15,817
Colors are easy
to change, Mr. Gates.

254
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,358
Now -- the white AS breaks
through the defense and runs

255
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:19,567
for the goal line!

256
00:13:19,650 --> 00:13:20,942
Look at that bastard run!

257
00:13:21,025 --> 00:13:21,650
Oh no!

258
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:23,025
Here comes enemy fire!

259
00:13:23,108 --> 00:13:26,400
Oh, I'm a regular
John Madman, aren't I?

260
00:13:26,483 --> 00:13:27,942
He just threw down his weapon!

261
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:29,358
Is he out of ammo?

262
00:13:29,442 --> 00:13:31,192
There's a pincer attack
waiting for him at the bridge!

263
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,442
He's in trouble now!

264
00:13:32,525 --> 00:13:33,442
And the dumb son of a bitch

265
00:13:33,525 --> 00:13:35,858
turns toward
the river and dives!

266
00:13:40,067 --> 00:13:43,525
Well we can suppose
it went that way.

267
00:13:43,608 --> 00:13:46,358
Guess I'll go see what in
the hell our client wants.

268
00:13:46,442 --> 00:13:49,150
Don't even THINK about pulling
a prank like this again!

269
00:13:49,233 --> 00:13:50,650
Do I make myself clear?

270
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:52,608
Understood clearly, ma'am!

271
00:13:54,733 --> 00:13:56,400
So how did it go?

272
00:13:57,400 --> 00:14:01,108
Seriously, what the heck has
gotten into you today, Sousuke?

273
00:14:01,192 --> 00:14:03,983
You're acting a little too
strange, even for you.

274
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,442
No!

275
00:14:05,525 --> 00:14:07,442
You're imagining things--
it must be all in your mind.

276
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:13,692
All right.

277
00:14:13,775 --> 00:14:15,817
If you don't want to
tell me that's your choice.

278
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:16,900
Kaname?

279
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,317
Hey, can I...

280
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:19,900
have a talk with you?

281
00:14:22,983 --> 00:14:25,525
Did you just say
you're not going to pay?

282
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:29,317
Your so--called "high--tech"
weaponry was useless crap!

283
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:33,692
And you mercenary scumbags
expect me PAY for this junk?

284
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,692
Just turn and walk away.

285
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,900
Huh?

286
00:14:40,983 --> 00:14:43,900
Stupid little fool, didn't your
sweet, darling mommy warn you...

287
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:46,858
"If you run into a scary
man... protect your wallet

288
00:14:46,942 --> 00:14:49,608
and your ass, or you'll
get it in the end."

289
00:14:49,692 --> 00:14:51,192
What the hell does that mean?

290
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:51,983
Heh!

291
00:14:52,067 --> 00:14:53,150
It's nothing.

292
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:55,733
Sleep tight, honey...

293
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,692
Bastard!

294
00:15:02,942 --> 00:15:03,983
Waste them.

295
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:24,150
Ave Maria...

296
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:28,192
Aa--Ah--Aaaaahhh...

297
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:29,858
What the heck IS this?!

298
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:33,025
It was probably sneak
photography using a tiny camera,

299
00:15:33,108 --> 00:15:35,942
so I suggested to Sousuke
that we find the culprit before

300
00:15:36,025 --> 00:15:38,983
you realized what was going on,
but I guess I just couldn't

301
00:15:39,067 --> 00:15:40,733
stand by and watch anymore...

302
00:15:40,817 --> 00:15:42,150
SAY YOUR PRAYERS,

303
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,775
cuz whoever did this will
incur THE WRATH OF GOD!!!

304
00:15:44,858 --> 00:15:46,733
Actually, we haven't
found the culpr--

305
00:15:46,817 --> 00:15:48,108
You mean you haven't
FOUND him?!!!

306
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,775
No, but I do have a clue.

307
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:51,150
Right here.

308
00:15:51,233 --> 00:15:52,067
What is it?

309
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:53,900
Mini--surveillance camera.

310
00:15:53,983 --> 00:15:55,692
I found it hidden
in the locker room.

311
00:15:55,775 --> 00:15:57,775
So that "investigation"
you were doing...

312
00:15:57,858 --> 00:15:59,983
Was to find this device
and pinpoint its frequency.

313
00:16:00,067 --> 00:16:01,817
Now all we need to do to
is trace that frequency

314
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,817
to its source and then we'll
have ourselves a culprit.

315
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:05,900
Oh, good work, Sousuke!

316
00:16:05,983 --> 00:16:07,608
Not a problem, Chidori.

317
00:16:11,608 --> 00:16:12,067
I've got it.

318
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:12,775
You do?

319
00:16:12,858 --> 00:16:13,858
Bearing zero nine zero.

320
00:16:13,942 --> 00:16:15,400
Distance, 5 meters.

321
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:16,650
But that would mean it's...

322
00:16:16,733 --> 00:16:17,983
The classroom next door.

323
00:16:18,067 --> 00:16:19,150
Let's get him!

324
00:16:22,483 --> 00:16:23,608
So it's you.

325
00:16:23,692 --> 00:16:25,942
Drop your weapon and
get down on the ground!

326
00:16:26,025 --> 00:16:26,983
Are you an idiot?

327
00:16:27,067 --> 00:16:28,525
Use some moderation
for a change!

328
00:16:28,608 --> 00:16:30,025
But I utilized the
most effective method

329
00:16:30,108 --> 00:16:31,108
of charging into the room--...

330
00:16:31,192 --> 00:16:33,025
Blasting a hole
in a classroom wall

331
00:16:33,108 --> 00:16:34,608
is your idea of "effective"?

332
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,233
The culprit's getting away.

333
00:16:37,817 --> 00:16:38,775
Go GET him!

334
00:16:38,858 --> 00:16:45,983
Ave Maria...

335
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,525
Hey, wait a minute.

336
00:16:58,608 --> 00:17:00,733
Did we kill all of them?

337
00:17:00,817 --> 00:17:03,817
How the hell are we supposed to
collect the rest of the money?

338
00:17:03,900 --> 00:17:05,650
But didn't you order us to...

339
00:17:08,233 --> 00:17:09,650
Don't give me that shit!

340
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:12,775
Mommy always says not to blame
other people, doesn't she?

341
00:17:12,858 --> 00:17:13,525
Hey!

342
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:14,233
HEEEYYY!

343
00:17:14,317 --> 00:17:15,858
Are you listening??!?!

344
00:17:16,858 --> 00:17:18,733
Oh dear...

345
00:17:18,817 --> 00:17:19,525
he's dead.

346
00:17:19,608 --> 00:17:21,025
Another senseless killing!

347
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:21,900
Oh...

348
00:17:21,983 --> 00:17:24,567
what is this world coming to?

349
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,567
It's filled with cruel
and meaningless death

350
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,942
and violence and...

351
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,817
It just breaks my heart...!

352
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,608
I can't go on!

353
00:17:31,692 --> 00:17:32,567
You idiot.

354
00:17:32,650 --> 00:17:33,358
Eh?

355
00:17:33,442 --> 00:17:34,858
What?

356
00:17:36,567 --> 00:17:37,775
Stay away!

357
00:17:38,733 --> 00:17:39,775
Stop right there!

358
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,025
Before you take another step,

359
00:17:41,108 --> 00:17:43,067
you better look at
this picture first!

360
00:17:43,733 --> 00:17:45,942
No!

361
00:17:46,775 --> 00:17:48,900
If you come any closer, I'll
send this embarrassing picture

362
00:17:48,983 --> 00:17:51,858
out to the whole world on every
single website I can find!!!!

363
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:54,108
How evil, senseless
and utterly tasteless!

364
00:17:54,192 --> 00:17:56,275
Boy, you're one to
talk about senselessness!

365
00:17:56,358 --> 00:17:56,942
You got that?

366
00:17:57,025 --> 00:17:57,733
You got that?

367
00:17:57,817 --> 00:17:59,150
Now scram!

368
00:17:59,233 --> 00:18:01,817
He's not only a perv, but
he's a big--ol' jerk, too.

369
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:02,983
Shut yer hole!

370
00:18:03,067 --> 00:18:05,650
This is my chance
at revenge, you got it?

371
00:18:05,733 --> 00:18:06,567
Excuse me?

372
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,608
Yeah that's right!

373
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:09,067
I'll never ever forget

374
00:18:09,150 --> 00:18:11,567
how you humiliated me in the
Student Council elections!

375
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:12,983
You ran?

376
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:14,942
So anyway...!

377
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:16,567
I'm going to spread this
all over the world,

378
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:19,275
and ruin your
non-nosepicking reputation!

379
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:22,608
So you shall know my righteous
hatred and searing agony!

380
00:18:22,692 --> 00:18:24,442
Wow, what a drama queen.

381
00:18:24,525 --> 00:18:27,233
Take a deep breath
and get ahold of yourself.

382
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:30,608
I--I told you to
stay away from me!

383
00:18:30,692 --> 00:18:31,858
I'll push it, I swear!

384
00:18:31,942 --> 00:18:33,483
Stop it, please!

385
00:18:33,567 --> 00:18:34,608
Fine, I'll just shoot him down.

386
00:18:34,692 --> 00:18:35,275
Yeah, do it.

387
00:18:35,358 --> 00:18:36,067
No, wait, don't!

388
00:18:36,150 --> 00:18:37,525
I--I'll do it!

389
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,692
I swear I'll push this button!

390
00:18:40,358 --> 00:18:40,858
Chidori.

391
00:18:40,942 --> 00:18:42,317
Yeah, what?

392
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,650
Our mission objective is to
stop him from transmitting

393
00:18:43,733 --> 00:18:44,733
the picture, isn't it?

394
00:18:44,817 --> 00:18:45,733
Yeah that's right!

395
00:18:45,817 --> 00:18:47,400
Then that should
be simple enough.

396
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:48,525
Huh?

397
00:18:49,733 --> 00:18:51,400
What's he doing?

398
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:05,275
No way...

399
00:19:05,358 --> 00:19:09,400
No!

400
00:19:12,983 --> 00:19:16,942
So, was it this mouth
that said those things, huh?

401
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:18,358
You called me an idiot?

402
00:19:18,442 --> 00:19:19,358
Huh?

403
00:19:19,442 --> 00:19:21,025
Did you, little girl?

404
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:22,233
How rude!

405
00:19:22,317 --> 00:19:25,192
You mustn't say
such nasty things.

406
00:19:25,275 --> 00:19:27,983
Or I'll give you a spanking!

407
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,150
You're no fun.

408
00:19:35,942 --> 00:19:37,317
We're leaving.

409
00:19:37,400 --> 00:19:38,775
Get ready.

410
00:19:39,983 --> 00:19:43,858
Oh yes, I just remembered.

411
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:45,400
I heard your Sensei

412
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,233
got turned into a bloated
rotting sack of fish food.

413
00:19:48,317 --> 00:19:50,608
I'm so very sorry.

414
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:59,858
So fine, my princess, so fine...

415
00:20:07,942 --> 00:20:09,608
Hello, Leonard.

416
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:10,567
Hi.

417
00:20:10,650 --> 00:20:12,525
It's been a while.

418
00:20:12,608 --> 00:20:15,900
So long in fact that
we almost forgot about you.

419
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,233
What do you want?

420
00:20:18,442 --> 00:20:21,275
I heard that you two
had picked up your Sensei.

421
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:22,525
Oh, really?

422
00:20:22,608 --> 00:20:24,983
News reaches you
quickly, doesn't it?

423
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:28,067
Personally, I would like you
two to keep a low profile,

424
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:30,067
if possible.

425
00:20:30,150 --> 00:20:31,525
Oh...

426
00:20:31,608 --> 00:20:33,858
Is that a warning?

427
00:20:33,942 --> 00:20:36,108
I intend it to be
a warning for now.

428
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,775
There's no need to worry.

429
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:40,775
We won't cause any trouble.

430
00:20:42,358 --> 00:20:44,858
So I can trust you?

431
00:20:44,942 --> 00:20:46,358
Of course.

432
00:20:47,608 --> 00:20:48,358
Please forgive me!

433
00:20:48,442 --> 00:20:49,358
I'm sorry!

434
00:20:49,442 --> 00:20:50,942
Then tell me the truth!

435
00:20:51,025 --> 00:20:53,692
What were your real intentions
for following Chidori around?

436
00:20:53,775 --> 00:20:55,483
It's just like I told you!

437
00:20:55,567 --> 00:20:57,483
So you want to act like
you don't know anything?

438
00:20:57,567 --> 00:20:59,608
Then fine, I'll ask your body!

439
00:21:01,192 --> 00:21:03,233
How 'bout we start
with a finger...

440
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,317
Which one should it be?

441
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,025
Stop it!

442
00:21:05,108 --> 00:21:06,108
No, PLEASE stop it!

443
00:21:06,192 --> 00:21:08,400
All right, all right,
that's enough.

444
00:21:08,483 --> 00:21:09,650
Why are you stopping me?

445
00:21:09,733 --> 00:21:10,817
Isn't it obvious?

446
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,067
He's just a normal
high school student.

447
00:21:13,150 --> 00:21:14,567
Oh, by the way.

448
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,400
There was someone peeping
into my apartment this morning.

449
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:17,442
Was that you, too?

450
00:21:17,525 --> 00:21:18,483
You bastard!

451
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:20,108
I--I don't know
anything about that!

452
00:21:20,192 --> 00:21:22,192
The only pictures I took
were at the school!

453
00:21:22,275 --> 00:21:23,608
Is that true?

454
00:21:23,692 --> 00:21:25,400
It's the truth, honest!

455
00:21:25,483 --> 00:21:26,942
You're a very good actor.

456
00:21:27,025 --> 00:21:28,567
But that's not gonna fool...

457
00:21:30,025 --> 00:21:30,650
Hold it!

458
00:21:30,733 --> 00:21:31,942
That's enough already.

459
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,567
But I wasn't through
with the interrogation...

460
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:35,525
Oh, that was plenty.

461
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:37,733
But still...

462
00:21:38,650 --> 00:21:40,192
I wonder what was
going on with that guy

463
00:21:40,275 --> 00:21:42,192
on the rooftop this morning.

464
00:21:44,442 --> 00:21:47,525
Wow, that radar
is really powerful!

465
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:51,567
Aww, now I have to buy
another cell phone.

466
00:22:11,525 --> 00:22:14,483
Ugh, I gotta take a shit.

467
00:23:47,525 --> 00:23:50,442
An enemy whose actions
seem somehow suspicious.

468
00:23:50,525 --> 00:23:52,483
An isolated
underground battlefield.

469
00:23:52,567 --> 00:23:54,275
And my lack of trust
in the machine I should

470
00:23:54,358 --> 00:23:55,775
look upon as my own.

471
00:23:55,858 --> 00:23:58,358
But still, it wasn't
a difficult mission.

472
00:23:58,442 --> 00:24:00,775
Next time: "The
Labyrinth and the Dragon."

473
00:24:00,858 --> 00:24:02,817
A deep, complex
spider web further

474
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,567
and further entangles us.
