1
00:02:06,983 --> 00:02:08,942
Balance is the key

2
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,275
We'll be there shortly,
Mister Gates.

3
00:02:11,358 --> 00:02:13,692
Fine, but balance
is still important;

4
00:02:13,775 --> 00:02:15,442
for people and for countries.

5
00:02:15,525 --> 00:02:16,775
Sir?

6
00:02:16,858 --> 00:02:18,858
Lean too far and you end up
falling off the beam

7
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,275
like a drunken gymnast!

8
00:02:20,358 --> 00:02:23,650
And if you lose your balance...!

9
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:26,358
you might lose your head.

10
00:02:26,442 --> 00:02:28,358
When you have the kinds
of customers we serve,

11
00:02:28,442 --> 00:02:30,608
you can't afford NOT to
have balance on BOTH sides

12
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,900
of the equation.

13
00:02:31,983 --> 00:02:33,525
Referring to North
and South China?

14
00:02:33,608 --> 00:02:34,817
Well! We should be catching up

15
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,608
to our little stray
pussycat any time now!

16
00:02:37,692 --> 00:02:38,233
Pussycat?

17
00:02:38,317 --> 00:02:39,442
Oh come on!

18
00:02:39,525 --> 00:02:41,150
Do I have to do all
your thinkin' for you?

19
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:43,358
I'm talking about
little Yui Lan!

20
00:02:43,442 --> 00:02:46,692
And what exactly do you
intend to do with her body?

21
00:02:46,775 --> 00:02:49,025
A beautiful young
body like that?

22
00:02:49,108 --> 00:02:52,400
Oh, there's still plenty
of uses for THAT body.

23
00:03:16,275 --> 00:03:18,358
Not exactly a local, are ya?

24
00:03:18,442 --> 00:03:21,150
So are ya Korean or Japanese?

25
00:03:21,233 --> 00:03:24,108
I don't have a
nationality to speak of.

26
00:03:24,192 --> 00:03:25,483
Huh?

27
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,567
Well if you don't have any
business here, please leave.

28
00:03:30,650 --> 00:03:32,150
I'm busy right now.

29
00:03:33,733 --> 00:03:35,400
Are you evacuating?

30
00:03:35,483 --> 00:03:37,400
Like everyone else.

31
00:03:45,025 --> 00:03:46,108
May I take this?

32
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:47,442
Weren't you leaving?

33
00:03:49,358 --> 00:03:50,775
At least let me pay you for it.

34
00:03:50,858 --> 00:03:51,733
I don't give a damn!

35
00:03:51,817 --> 00:03:52,817
Take it!

36
00:03:53,817 --> 00:03:55,358
You must have some
kind of death wish.

37
00:03:55,442 --> 00:03:56,983
Get outta here!

38
00:04:04,692 --> 00:04:07,317
Death wish?

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,358
That's pretty close, actually.

40
00:04:24,317 --> 00:04:26,192
All units, Urzu 9.

41
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:28,608
Now investigating Point 28.

42
00:04:28,692 --> 00:04:29,858
Tighten your search perimeter

43
00:04:29,942 --> 00:04:32,192
if we don't contact
within fifteen minutes.

44
00:04:32,275 --> 00:04:34,192
Urzu 2, Wilco.

45
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:36,275
Wangfu headquarters copies.

46
00:04:36,358 --> 00:04:38,192
Be careful out there.

47
00:04:39,442 --> 00:04:41,192
Is something the matter,
Corporal?

48
00:04:41,275 --> 00:04:43,025
Nothing, but it's been
a while since we've heard

49
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:44,650
from Sergeant Sagara.

50
00:04:44,733 --> 00:04:46,233
So did the sergeant
major give you a reason

51
00:04:46,317 --> 00:04:47,400
to think there
might be trouble?

52
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:48,775
No, I don't think so.

53
00:04:48,858 --> 00:04:50,650
But anyway, we've got our
own work to worry about,

54
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:51,900
so let's go.

55
00:04:51,983 --> 00:04:53,650
Yeah, we should get going.

56
00:05:09,233 --> 00:05:10,233
Nothing here.

57
00:05:10,317 --> 00:05:11,775
That leaves us 12
more points to go.

58
00:05:28,067 --> 00:05:29,692
He must've been
a worker here, huh?

59
00:05:29,775 --> 00:05:30,900
Probably.

60
00:05:30,983 --> 00:05:33,108
Looks like he's been
dead for about two days.

61
00:05:33,192 --> 00:05:35,858
Guess he stumbled on
their hideout by mistake.

62
00:05:35,942 --> 00:05:37,442
No way to tell for sure.

63
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:40,525
But even if it was, they sure as
hell ain't comin' back to this.

64
00:05:41,942 --> 00:05:44,317
It looks like somebody wrote
something on his chest, huh?

65
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,608
Yeah...

66
00:05:50,442 --> 00:05:52,442
The Son of Bdakshon's Tiger.

67
00:05:52,525 --> 00:05:55,067
Meet Hamidra at Tsim Sha Tsui?

68
00:05:55,150 --> 00:05:57,108
Okay, What in the hell
is that supposed to mean?

69
00:05:57,192 --> 00:05:59,400
Well, your guess is
as good as mine.

70
00:06:00,442 --> 00:06:03,525
Do we have any reports of a
Venom sighting yet, Tessa?

71
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:06,692
60 percent of the
search points on the list

72
00:06:06,775 --> 00:06:08,650
have been eliminated, Admiral.

73
00:06:08,733 --> 00:06:11,817
We're working as quickly
as we can, but nothing yet.

74
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:13,317
Have we had any success

75
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,775
in convincing the Chinese
governments not to take action?

76
00:06:15,858 --> 00:06:17,983
No shots fired,
if that's what you mean.

77
00:06:18,067 --> 00:06:20,275
But they're hardly in a mood
to let go of their suspicions

78
00:06:20,358 --> 00:06:22,025
and reinstate the cease-fire.

79
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:24,150
Both sides have been holding
grudges against each other

80
00:06:24,233 --> 00:06:27,317
for years and this
just dials up the tension.

81
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,525
Of course,
we're still negotiating.

82
00:06:29,608 --> 00:06:33,442
But at this rate, we've
only got about 3 hours left.

83
00:06:33,525 --> 00:06:35,650
Only three hours?

84
00:06:35,733 --> 00:06:38,733
Well, I'm hoping to hear good
news from you before then.

85
00:06:38,817 --> 00:06:39,942
That is all.

86
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:44,942
Captain, Urzu 2 is on line G1.

87
00:06:45,025 --> 00:06:45,567
Put her on.

88
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:47,608
Aye-aye, Ma'am.

89
00:06:47,692 --> 00:06:49,775
Urzu 2 to TDD HQ.

90
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:52,442
Urzu 9 has discovered
a suspicious corpse,

91
00:06:52,525 --> 00:06:54,650
and it has a message
inscribed on the body.

92
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:56,233
Please continue...

93
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:57,692
Roger.

94
00:06:57,775 --> 00:07:00,025
Our victim was a middle-aged
man who was shot to death.

95
00:07:00,108 --> 00:07:02,400
He was discovered
at Search Point 28.

96
00:07:02,483 --> 00:07:05,942
The message states: "To the
son of Badahkshone's Tiger.

97
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:08,858
Meet Hamidra
at Tsim Sha Tsui.

98
00:07:08,942 --> 00:07:10,983
"Also, Intelligence
confirms there have been

99
00:07:11,067 --> 00:07:13,233
two other instances
of the same message,

100
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:16,483
and three reports of printings
in the local classifieds.

101
00:07:16,567 --> 00:07:19,692
They sure are going to a lot
of trouble to find this guy.

102
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:20,650
Is that all?

103
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:21,858
That's it, Commander.

104
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:22,858
Fine.

105
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:24,358
Cover the rest of
the search area.

106
00:07:24,442 --> 00:07:25,025
Roger.

107
00:07:25,108 --> 00:07:27,108
Urzu 2 out.

108
00:07:27,192 --> 00:07:29,442
I wonder what that
message could have meant...

109
00:07:29,525 --> 00:07:31,942
Well, speaking of Bdakshon,
Commander Kalinin has

110
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,775
an outstanding working knowledge
of that area of the world.

111
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:36,483
Call Commander Kalinin
to the bridge and run

112
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:39,275
a cryptographic
analysis on the message.

113
00:07:39,358 --> 00:07:40,317
Yes, Ma'am.

114
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,233
I'm puzzled, Madame Captain.

115
00:07:42,317 --> 00:07:44,150
There's nothing in that
message that would throw us off

116
00:07:44,233 --> 00:07:45,775
of Venom's trail.

117
00:07:47,817 --> 00:07:49,567
Any idea what this means?

118
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,150
"Bdakshon's Tiger" is
a man, Madame Captain.

119
00:07:52,233 --> 00:07:55,192
A legendary guerilla
commander in Hellmajistan.

120
00:07:55,275 --> 00:07:56,608
His name is Majid.

121
00:07:56,692 --> 00:07:58,067
Helmajistan?

122
00:07:58,150 --> 00:08:00,775
I engaged him in battle
on several occasions.

123
00:08:00,858 --> 00:08:03,858
My comrades in the Soviet
Army sent numerous assassins

124
00:08:03,942 --> 00:08:07,817
into Helmajistan, trying to
eliminate Majid without success.

125
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,192
One of the assassins they
sent was a boy not even

126
00:08:11,275 --> 00:08:12,983
8 years old at the time.

127
00:08:13,067 --> 00:08:14,692
It was a child?

128
00:08:14,775 --> 00:08:18,067
Majid had a reputation for
compassion that didn't change

129
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,692
even when he captured this
would-be assassin and gave him

130
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:25,317
a new name as his "son."
And that name was Kashim.

131
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,733
Then that means...

132
00:08:26,817 --> 00:08:27,775
Kashim!

133
00:08:27,858 --> 00:08:31,483
We're not friends,
YOU SHITHEAD!!!

134
00:08:31,567 --> 00:08:32,983
Mister Sagara...

135
00:08:33,067 --> 00:08:35,692
Captain, we need to
inform Sergeant Sagara.

136
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,442
Right...

137
00:08:36,525 --> 00:08:37,900
Get me Urzu 2.

138
00:08:37,983 --> 00:08:39,192
Yes, ma'am.

139
00:08:39,275 --> 00:08:40,233
Go ahead.

140
00:08:40,317 --> 00:08:42,317
TDD HQ to Urzu 2.

141
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,400
Please put Urzu 7 on the line.

142
00:08:45,692 --> 00:08:48,400
Ma'am, this is Uruz 2.

143
00:08:48,483 --> 00:08:49,525
Umm...

144
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:51,567
Is something wrong?

145
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:56,400
I'm sorry, but
Urzu 7 isn't here.

146
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,983
You're not Chinese, huh?

147
00:09:57,067 --> 00:09:58,483
That's affirmative.

148
00:10:00,275 --> 00:10:04,275
Well okay Mister "Affirmative."
So ya got any money on ya,

149
00:10:04,358 --> 00:10:05,233
or what?

150
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:06,608
I have a little.

151
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,567
Well how about it,
are you free right now?

152
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,900
Yes.

153
00:10:11,983 --> 00:10:12,942
Then would you like to
have a little fun with me

154
00:10:13,025 --> 00:10:14,650
back at my place?

155
00:10:44,358 --> 00:10:47,567
What, are you queer
or something?

156
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:50,192
Sure, whatever...

157
00:10:50,275 --> 00:10:52,775
Let's head back to your place.

158
00:10:52,858 --> 00:10:53,900
You little letch!

159
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,608
What are you doing
playing hard to get?

160
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:58,317
You know you wanna!

161
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,567
Come on--it's
just down the street.

162
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:13,317
What do you mean Sousuke
abandoned the mission?

163
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,275
You're not serious, are ya?

164
00:11:15,358 --> 00:11:16,483
That's right.

165
00:11:16,567 --> 00:11:17,942
I heard that he got
into a traffic accident

166
00:11:18,025 --> 00:11:19,817
and just wandered off somewhere.

167
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,317
Hmmm...

168
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,567
But that's not
something he would do...

169
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,775
Did you hear anything,
Lieutenant?

170
00:11:25,858 --> 00:11:28,233
Just some bits and pieces
here and there.

171
00:11:28,317 --> 00:11:30,400
Not enough to make
a judgment call.

172
00:11:30,483 --> 00:11:33,150
And Kalinin seems
to agree with me...

173
00:11:33,233 --> 00:11:36,275
Regardless, we can't count on
having Sagara or the Arbalest

174
00:11:36,358 --> 00:11:37,900
on our side in this battle.

175
00:11:37,983 --> 00:11:40,192
He was good for a while, but
a seventeen-year-old punk

176
00:11:40,275 --> 00:11:42,858
like that was bound to crack up
out there and lose his nerve

177
00:11:42,942 --> 00:11:44,733
on a mission
sometime or another.

178
00:11:44,817 --> 00:11:46,525
That doesn't matter, you idiot!

179
00:11:46,608 --> 00:11:48,150
I still can't
believe it myself.

180
00:11:48,233 --> 00:11:50,733
Sagara was always a straight
arrow and he never woulda

181
00:11:50,817 --> 00:11:53,567
thought about bailing out
on a mission like this.

182
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:54,733
It's that girl.

183
00:11:54,817 --> 00:11:55,817
Chidori.

184
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,775
C'mon, think about it
for a minute.

185
00:11:57,858 --> 00:12:00,025
Ever since he came back
from that assignment to guard

186
00:12:00,108 --> 00:12:02,900
that Whispered kid,
his brain's been AWOL.

187
00:12:02,983 --> 00:12:04,108
Yeah.

188
00:12:04,192 --> 00:12:05,567
Now that you mention it,
that's gotta be it.

189
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:08,150
What do you think, Roger?

190
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:10,483
I think I don't
know Sagara that well.

191
00:12:10,567 --> 00:12:13,442
But I do know that what a man
carries deep down in his soul

192
00:12:13,525 --> 00:12:15,317
doesn't change that easily.

193
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,025
And if it's in his nature to be
a hawk, then what do you think?

194
00:12:19,108 --> 00:12:20,650
A hawk stays a hawk.

195
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,233
Right.

196
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,483
So, you want yours with
water or on the rocks?

197
00:12:31,567 --> 00:12:32,525
You decide.

198
00:12:32,608 --> 00:12:34,775
Okay, on the rocks then.

199
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:46,400
You know something?

200
00:12:46,483 --> 00:12:48,567
You look like this guy
I dated a while back.

201
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:52,692
We only went out
for a little while,

202
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,067
cuz I had to
dump his sorry ass.

203
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:02,692
Yep, turned out
to be a total poseur.

204
00:13:02,775 --> 00:13:04,233
You know what I mean?

205
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,775
I mean when he was around me
he'd act like he was a big shot,

206
00:13:06,858 --> 00:13:09,192
but when he got around other
people acted so spineless

207
00:13:09,275 --> 00:13:12,608
that I just wanted to rip his
face off and feed it to him!

208
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:15,067
Kinda funny that I'd end up
hanging out with you,

209
00:13:15,150 --> 00:13:16,608
seeing as how you look like him.

210
00:13:16,692 --> 00:13:19,483
Well, except that he wasn't
always frowning like you!

211
00:13:19,567 --> 00:13:20,733
Hey.

212
00:13:20,817 --> 00:13:22,025
You gotta have a smile
in there somewhere.

213
00:13:22,108 --> 00:13:23,608
Come on!

214
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:25,358
I'm sure you'd feel
a lot better if you just

215
00:13:25,442 --> 00:13:27,650
loosened up and relaxed.

216
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:34,025
I never really had
a reason to smile.

217
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,900
Fighting is all I know.

218
00:13:40,692 --> 00:13:42,192
But you're a frickin janitor!

219
00:13:42,275 --> 00:13:43,067
Whattya do?

220
00:13:43,150 --> 00:13:44,733
Shoot people with your broom?

221
00:13:53,317 --> 00:13:53,858
Oh, God!

222
00:13:53,942 --> 00:13:55,400
You are too much!

223
00:13:55,483 --> 00:13:56,483
And the way you said it with

224
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:59,192
a straight face
made it even funnier!

225
00:14:00,233 --> 00:14:01,483
Oh really?

226
00:14:01,567 --> 00:14:03,983
I'm sorry, but you weren't
actually serious about

227
00:14:04,067 --> 00:14:05,692
all that fighting stuff?

228
00:14:05,775 --> 00:14:07,275
I was joking.

229
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:27,400
So, Mister Fighting Janitor,
were you on a secret mission

230
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:28,817
when I met you out there?

231
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,150
I was working.

232
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:31,775
All by yourself?

233
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:32,483
No.

234
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,358
I had comrades with me.

235
00:14:34,442 --> 00:14:36,692
So where are
these comrades now?

236
00:14:38,275 --> 00:14:40,275
I guess they're still working.

237
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:41,150
Oh!

238
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,900
So you bailed out on 'em, huh?

239
00:14:43,983 --> 00:14:45,067
Affirmative.

240
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:49,067
Well, that's okay.

241
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:50,567
When shit gets crazy,

242
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:53,733
it's okay to just
walk away if you have to.

243
00:14:53,817 --> 00:14:55,233
Is that right?

244
00:14:55,317 --> 00:14:56,858
Yeah that's right.

245
00:15:00,775 --> 00:15:02,817
The real idiots in this world
are the ones who take life

246
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:05,358
too seriously and
never loosen up...

247
00:15:07,567 --> 00:15:09,650
I thought I could
bear anything...

248
00:15:09,733 --> 00:15:11,858
as long as you
were here with me.

249
00:15:12,942 --> 00:15:14,942
I mean, they can always get
somebody else to clean up

250
00:15:15,025 --> 00:15:18,858
the messes if you
skip out on the job, right?

251
00:15:18,942 --> 00:15:21,150
I won't burden you anymore...

252
00:15:23,108 --> 00:15:23,692
What?

253
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:24,858
Is something wrong?

254
00:15:24,942 --> 00:15:26,983
You're not having
second thoughts are you?

255
00:15:27,067 --> 00:15:28,608
Well I don't know.

256
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:30,483
One thing's for sure.

257
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,442
I can't return to my comrades.

258
00:15:32,525 --> 00:15:35,650
Oh come on, you're not the first
guy to play hooky from work!

259
00:15:35,733 --> 00:15:36,900
Why don't you just
tell 'em you're sorry

260
00:15:36,983 --> 00:15:38,442
and they'll get over it.

261
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:39,775
No, I can't.

262
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:42,067
I've already violated the
faith they placed in me.

263
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:43,650
Oh, big frickin deal!

264
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:46,483
I mean, sure, they say they're
your comrades but you never know

265
00:15:46,567 --> 00:15:48,317
when they're gonna
stab you in the back.

266
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,400
Keep your eyes open and
keep a safe distance,

267
00:15:50,483 --> 00:15:51,858
and then they can't get to you.

268
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:54,192
The truth is...

269
00:15:54,275 --> 00:15:56,192
I feel safest with you...

270
00:15:57,483 --> 00:15:58,858
Here's what I've learned...

271
00:15:58,942 --> 00:16:01,358
Just lean on everyone else,
and get as much as you can

272
00:16:01,442 --> 00:16:03,442
out of 'em, cuz that's all
they're really good for,

273
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:04,567
you know?

274
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,900
And once the
relationship is over, BAM!

275
00:16:06,983 --> 00:16:08,858
You just toss 'em
to the side...

276
00:16:13,442 --> 00:16:16,150
Hey, Mr. Fighting Janitor,
why don't you join the party

277
00:16:16,233 --> 00:16:18,650
and start drinking with me, huh?

278
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:21,400
I've never had alcohol before.

279
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,233
You gotta be kidding.

280
00:16:23,317 --> 00:16:25,608
The effects would only
hinder my abilities.

281
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:28,733
Whatever, honey.

282
00:16:28,817 --> 00:16:31,692
If you don't wanna drink,
I have a suggestion for you.

283
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,983
Have a little fun and forget
all your troubles with me.

284
00:16:35,067 --> 00:16:37,150
And if that doesn't help you
forget your comrades,

285
00:16:37,233 --> 00:16:40,317
we can get drunk off our
asses and do it some more.

286
00:16:47,150 --> 00:16:48,817
I'll make you happy.

287
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,317
Sousuke...

288
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,983
Sousuke!

289
00:16:53,067 --> 00:16:55,692
Sousuke!

290
00:16:55,775 --> 00:16:57,692
Sousuke.

291
00:16:57,775 --> 00:16:59,817
Sousuke.

292
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,608
Just relax, okay?

293
00:17:05,858 --> 00:17:07,192
What was that for?

294
00:17:07,275 --> 00:17:08,525
I changed my mind.

295
00:17:08,608 --> 00:17:09,317
What?

296
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,067
I've decided not to do it.

297
00:17:13,442 --> 00:17:15,900
What in the hell
is wrong with you?!

298
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:18,400
Thanks anyway.

299
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:20,817
Hey, garbage man!

300
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,442
Take this with you!

301
00:17:25,983 --> 00:17:28,025
Now get the hell out!

302
00:17:46,567 --> 00:17:47,858
It's time.

303
00:17:47,942 --> 00:17:49,942
Are you ready, Teletha?

304
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,692
Deploy all your M9s.

305
00:17:51,775 --> 00:17:53,483
Engage Venom
wherever it shows up next,

306
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:55,692
and take it down
with all you've got.

307
00:17:55,775 --> 00:17:57,942
However, I don't want
the Arbalest out there.

308
00:17:58,025 --> 00:18:01,275
We can't afford to expose
that machine to any danger.

309
00:18:01,358 --> 00:18:03,192
But we need more time, Admiral.

310
00:18:03,275 --> 00:18:04,983
My pilots haven't finalized
their countermeasures

311
00:18:05,067 --> 00:18:06,483
against Venom, yet!

312
00:18:06,567 --> 00:18:09,567
If we send them now, we're
risking excessive casualties!

313
00:18:09,650 --> 00:18:11,567
Please give me
at least two more hours...

314
00:18:11,650 --> 00:18:13,442
Lord Mallory and I
have already conferred

315
00:18:13,525 --> 00:18:14,733
on this matter, Captain.

316
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:16,317
Admiral...

317
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:19,442
Tensions between the North and
South are at the breaking point.

318
00:18:19,525 --> 00:18:20,900
And every time Venom appears,

319
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:23,900
the body count goes up and
we can't allow that anymore.

320
00:18:23,983 --> 00:18:25,817
The situation is urgent.

321
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,483
How many more people
are going to die while

322
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:29,900
you're sitting there
"getting ready?"

323
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,275
But I just...

324
00:18:31,358 --> 00:18:33,317
I've heard that Venom has
a short operating time

325
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,650
when it's out in the field.

326
00:18:34,733 --> 00:18:37,233
You can use that
to your advantage.

327
00:18:37,317 --> 00:18:39,733
Have faith in the people
under your command.

328
00:18:39,817 --> 00:18:42,567
Nobody else in the world
can do what they can.

329
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:46,358
I know this is
hard for you, Teletha.

330
00:18:46,442 --> 00:18:48,775
But I told you
you'd face these choices.

331
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:50,608
And you still chose
to retain your command

332
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,108
in spite of all that,
didn't you?

333
00:18:54,942 --> 00:18:57,150
Yes, that is true, sir.

334
00:18:57,233 --> 00:18:59,900
Then it's in your hands,
Captain Testarossa.

335
00:18:59,983 --> 00:19:01,942
Do it quickly.

336
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:03,483
Understood.

337
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:12,858
X-O, take us up to periscope
depth and flood all

338
00:19:12,942 --> 00:19:14,733
the underwater launch
hatches on the double.

339
00:19:14,817 --> 00:19:16,275
Aye, Ma'am.

340
00:19:16,358 --> 00:19:19,108
Ahead one-third, set your uptrim
five degrees and begin rise

341
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:20,817
to periscope depth.

342
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:27,525
They've called off the search?

343
00:19:27,608 --> 00:19:28,817
Affirmative.

344
00:19:28,900 --> 00:19:31,483
Head to the extraction point
and board your M9.

345
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:35,358
Join up with Urzu 1 at point
Echo at oh-four-thirty hours.

346
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,483
You will receive
your next orders there.

347
00:19:37,567 --> 00:19:39,025
Urzu 2, Roger.

348
00:19:39,108 --> 00:19:39,817
That's it.

349
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,608
TDD-HQ out.

350
00:20:03,192 --> 00:20:05,692
Begin flooding
underwater launch hatches.

351
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,733
Flooding all
underwater launch hatches.

352
00:20:07,817 --> 00:20:09,025
Aye, sir.

353
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,942
So you're telling me we've
run out of time, General?

354
00:20:16,025 --> 00:20:17,233
That's right.

355
00:20:17,317 --> 00:20:18,775
It's in the hands of the
Tactical Division now.

356
00:20:18,858 --> 00:20:20,233
I understand, General.

357
00:20:20,317 --> 00:20:21,358
Goodbye.

358
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:28,692
Shit!

359
00:20:30,567 --> 00:20:33,108
We're at periscope depth
and trim is level.

360
00:20:33,192 --> 00:20:34,108
Stop engines!

361
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:35,442
All engines stop.

362
00:20:35,525 --> 00:20:37,108
Hatch flooding complete.

363
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,442
Open all hatches.

364
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:40,442
Opening hatches, aye.

365
00:20:47,192 --> 00:20:50,275
Preparations for launch are
now complete, Madame Captain.

366
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:01,192
Launch all units.

367
00:21:01,275 --> 00:21:02,150
Aye, Captain.

368
00:21:02,233 --> 00:21:03,608
Launch all units.

369
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,775
Urzu 1 copies.

370
00:21:04,858 --> 00:21:06,983
All units, you are
now clear for launch!

371
00:21:07,067 --> 00:21:08,442
Urzu 3, Roger.

372
00:21:08,525 --> 00:21:09,608
Urzu 5, Roger.

373
00:21:09,692 --> 00:21:10,942
Urzu 8, Roger.

374
00:21:11,025 --> 00:21:12,692
Uruz 6, Roger that.

375
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:48,233
People actually drink this?

376
00:22:04,692 --> 00:22:07,108
"To the son of Bdakshon's Tiger.

377
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:09,775
Meet Hamidra at Tsim Sha Tsui."

378
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:49,650
Time is almost up.

379
00:23:49,733 --> 00:23:52,942
A deserted city echoes with a
message from the underworld.

380
00:23:53,025 --> 00:23:55,275
A mastermind behind the scenes.

381
00:23:55,358 --> 00:23:57,108
Is this who's calling me?

382
00:23:57,192 --> 00:23:59,775
Next time:
"Burning Hong Kong."

383
00:23:59,858 --> 00:24:02,650
A corpse taunts me from
the darkness, beckoning me

384
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,692
back to my desolate past.
