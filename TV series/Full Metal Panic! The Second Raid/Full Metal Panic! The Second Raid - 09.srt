1
00:03:05,317 --> 00:03:06,900
Hey, what's the matter, Kaname?

2
00:03:06,983 --> 00:03:08,525
You scared me...

3
00:03:10,525 --> 00:03:11,942
What's wrong with her?

4
00:03:15,025 --> 00:03:16,650
Are you sick or something?

5
00:03:16,733 --> 00:03:19,400
Maybe you should go
and see the nurse.

6
00:03:19,483 --> 00:03:20,233
No.

7
00:03:20,317 --> 00:03:21,650
I'm fine.

8
00:03:24,858 --> 00:03:27,233
Kaname Chidori from class 2-4.

9
00:03:27,317 --> 00:03:30,275
Please come to the
faculty room immediately.

10
00:03:31,775 --> 00:03:32,650
Unfortunately...

11
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:33,608
your friend Sagara...

12
00:03:33,692 --> 00:03:35,775
sent this letter to my office.

13
00:03:35,858 --> 00:03:39,692
Umm, it's actually
kind of upsetting...

14
00:03:39,775 --> 00:03:41,275
Chidori, are you feeling well?

15
00:03:41,358 --> 00:03:42,317
You look pale.

16
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,858
I'm okay

17
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:47,567
So what was in the envelope,
Ms. Kagurazaka?

18
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:50,067
His withdrawal notice.

19
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:53,317
Sure, he's been absent
from school a lot lately...

20
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,525
but I never thought
he'd leave without notice.

21
00:03:56,608 --> 00:03:59,192
And he isn't
answering his phone.

22
00:03:59,275 --> 00:04:02,025
I'm starting to get
worried about him.

23
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:02,983
So anyway.

24
00:04:03,067 --> 00:04:04,025
I wondered...

25
00:04:04,108 --> 00:04:04,983
Yes?

26
00:04:05,067 --> 00:04:06,608
Do you know what's going on?

27
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:07,775
No idea.

28
00:04:07,858 --> 00:04:08,692
Now wait...

29
00:04:08,775 --> 00:04:09,942
I really don't know.

30
00:04:10,025 --> 00:04:12,067
Are you two fighting
again or something?

31
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:13,358
No.

32
00:04:15,692 --> 00:04:19,233
If I don't hear something
by tomorrow, Then I'll...

33
00:04:19,317 --> 00:04:22,567
I'll have to give this to
the principal for acceptance.

34
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,483
Will he be dropped
from the roster?

35
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,400
Calm down.

36
00:04:36,483 --> 00:04:38,150
He's not here anymore.

37
00:04:38,233 --> 00:04:40,400
I don't know what happened...

38
00:04:40,483 --> 00:04:42,483
but I do know that
if someone comes after me,

39
00:04:42,567 --> 00:04:44,942
he won't be around
to save me this time.

40
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:47,025
And I'm obviously being watched.

41
00:04:47,108 --> 00:04:48,942
I have to think of a plan.

42
00:04:49,025 --> 00:04:51,775
I mean, I can't put
Ms. Kagurazaka, Kyoko,

43
00:04:51,858 --> 00:04:54,067
and everyone
in danger for my sake.

44
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,900
So get it together, Kaname!

45
00:04:55,983 --> 00:04:58,775
You're not some weak-kneed fairy
princess who can't do anything

46
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:00,983
but wait to be rescued!

47
00:05:01,067 --> 00:05:04,233
I need information so I can
figure out what's going on here!

48
00:05:56,775 --> 00:05:59,400
Maybe I'm just being
a little too paranoid.

49
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,900
By yourself, sweetheart?

50
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:17,275
So, how would you like to
go get something good to eat?

51
00:06:17,358 --> 00:06:18,942
It'll be on me, I promise.

52
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:20,817
Sorry, I'm not hungry, okay?

53
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:23,650
Oh, come on now!

54
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,192
Well, let's grab a drink then.

55
00:06:25,275 --> 00:06:27,275
I know a good place
just up the street.

56
00:06:27,358 --> 00:06:28,525
Look, mister...

57
00:06:28,608 --> 00:06:31,317
I'm kinda in the middle
of something right now.

58
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,817
Like what?

59
00:06:34,692 --> 00:06:37,442
Actually, you wanna
go to a hotel?

60
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,108
Here we are, Mizuki-chan!

61
00:06:43,192 --> 00:06:45,108
Let's go have some fun!

62
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:46,733
Hang on a sec.

63
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:52,317
Yeah, this is good.

64
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,108
All right, Mizuki-chan.

65
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:56,275
Let's get crazy tonight!

66
00:06:58,775 --> 00:07:00,483
So which room do you want?

67
00:07:00,567 --> 00:07:01,817
202.

68
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:03,275
Why that one?

69
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:04,567
Wouldn't you rather get the
one with the bearskin rug

70
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:06,400
and the hot tub?!

71
00:07:06,483 --> 00:07:08,400
You wanna do this or not?!

72
00:07:08,483 --> 00:07:09,275
Just kidding!

73
00:07:09,358 --> 00:07:10,775
That's one of my favorites...!

74
00:07:15,858 --> 00:07:17,733
Mizuki-chan.

75
00:07:20,692 --> 00:07:21,983
Now, wait a minute!

76
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:23,275
I don't think you understand...

77
00:07:23,358 --> 00:07:24,733
You wanna take
a bath afterwards?

78
00:07:24,817 --> 00:07:26,275
Hold on, damn it!

79
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:28,192
You're so cute!

80
00:07:29,983 --> 00:07:33,483
You high school girls
smell so GOOD!

81
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:34,942
Okay...

82
00:07:37,858 --> 00:07:40,900
Honestly, what ever happened to
good, old-fashioned romance?

83
00:08:03,192 --> 00:08:05,608
On second thought,
I'll hang on to these...

84
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:19,483
This one should do it...

85
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:22,275
Okay!

86
00:09:40,108 --> 00:09:41,858
That's it!

87
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,692
It has to be the best vantage
point there is around here.

88
00:09:49,775 --> 00:09:53,025
So if he's watching,
he's up there...

89
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,692
Bingo!

90
00:10:46,275 --> 00:10:47,358
Don't move.

91
00:10:47,442 --> 00:10:49,525
I have a weapon
pointed right at you.

92
00:10:49,608 --> 00:10:52,400
Put your hands up
and turn around.

93
00:10:52,483 --> 00:10:54,025
Hmm...

94
00:10:54,108 --> 00:10:56,650
I assume you must have
noticed the transmitter?

95
00:10:56,733 --> 00:10:58,775
I've had enough
of you following me.

96
00:10:58,858 --> 00:11:00,358
Now you and I need to talk.

97
00:11:00,442 --> 00:11:03,233
So you decided your best
cover was going to a love hotel

98
00:11:03,317 --> 00:11:05,067
with a complete stranger?

99
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,275
Resourceful...

100
00:11:06,358 --> 00:11:08,275
if a little "unorthodox."

101
00:11:08,358 --> 00:11:10,608
I'm guessing you
have a gun on you, right?

102
00:11:10,692 --> 00:11:13,442
So just take it out slowly
and toss it away from you!

103
00:11:13,525 --> 00:11:15,983
I not going to attack you,
Miss Chidori.

104
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,817
After all, I'm from
Mithril Intelligence.

105
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,900
You don't say!

106
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:22,067
Well I don't trust you.

107
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:23,817
Now take it easy.

108
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,608
I may not be allowed
to inflict harm on you...

109
00:11:26,692 --> 00:11:28,567
but nothing in my
directives says I can't

110
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:31,067
shut that smart-ass
mouth of yours.

111
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,692
I'm not your problem...

112
00:11:32,775 --> 00:11:33,942
Miss Chidori.

113
00:11:34,025 --> 00:11:35,983
Someone else has
been following you...

114
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:38,067
I said to drop the gun, asshole!

115
00:11:38,150 --> 00:11:39,275
Do it NOW!

116
00:11:41,817 --> 00:11:43,192
Huh?

117
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,442
Kaname Chidori, correct?

118
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:21,275
I'm alive.

119
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,483
Is this gonna work?

120
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,067
Will it hit her?

121
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:42,608
Or is she just toying with me
'cause she knows I'm up here?

122
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:44,108
It wouldn't be this easy!

123
00:13:44,192 --> 00:13:45,233
Is it a trick?

124
00:13:45,317 --> 00:13:46,442
She's a PRO!

125
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,692
She could easily have me
begging for my life!

126
00:13:48,775 --> 00:13:49,858
I can't win!

127
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,233
Chidori, you cannot
afford to have mercy

128
00:13:51,317 --> 00:13:52,817
in a situation like that.

129
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:55,858
Remaining idle in front of your
attacker is not a wise decision.

130
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,233
Well, it looks like you've won.

131
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,317
You know what...

132
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:28,858
I believe there are only two
kinds of women in this world.

133
00:14:28,942 --> 00:14:31,650
The ones who look good in the
rain, and the ones who don't.

134
00:14:31,733 --> 00:14:34,192
And I dare say you
are one of the former.

135
00:14:35,317 --> 00:14:37,775
Anyone who saw you right
now would be hard-pressed

136
00:14:37,858 --> 00:14:38,983
to disagree.

137
00:14:39,067 --> 00:14:39,817
Really?

138
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,692
Are you trying to be funny?

139
00:14:41,775 --> 00:14:43,317
I'm offended.

140
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:46,817
It was intended to be
the highest compliment.

141
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,733
Whatever.

142
00:14:47,817 --> 00:14:49,483
Who are you?

143
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,775
You and I are quite the same.

144
00:14:51,858 --> 00:14:54,150
And I came here to rescue you.

145
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:57,400
Well, I wish that were true,
but unfortunately, it's not.

146
00:14:57,483 --> 00:14:58,483
You might have been "saved"

147
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:00,983
if I'd merely watched
from a distance.

148
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:04,275
And I supposed you'd have been
saved if I'd done it myself.

149
00:15:04,358 --> 00:15:06,025
It works either way.

150
00:15:06,108 --> 00:15:07,567
That's enough of the poetry.

151
00:15:07,650 --> 00:15:09,400
Just give me a straight answer,
all right?

152
00:15:09,483 --> 00:15:10,692
Actually, I don't

153
00:15:10,775 --> 00:15:13,067
think very highly of
being TOO straightforward.

154
00:15:13,150 --> 00:15:16,483
That, plus the fact that your
beauty's rather distracting.

155
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,733
That hair...

156
00:15:19,817 --> 00:15:22,025
You can't be Tessa's...

157
00:15:22,108 --> 00:15:24,567
Don't be rude, Yui Lan.

158
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:26,400
Won't you join us?

159
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:30,067
So you were watching,
Mr. Silver?

160
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:32,942
Miss Chidori is far too
strong for you to defeat her.

161
00:15:33,025 --> 00:15:34,608
So I want you to stop it.

162
00:15:35,692 --> 00:15:37,983
The organization isn't
pleased by this at all,

163
00:15:38,067 --> 00:15:40,067
but I will find
a way to defend you...

164
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:43,400
if you can talk your sister
out of destroying Hong Kong...

165
00:15:43,483 --> 00:15:46,025
Do you honestly
think we'll obey you?

166
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:48,233
Revenge is such an empty thing.

167
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:50,858
Sensei wants it and so do we.

168
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:54,150
As long as I'm still alive,
I will keep trying to kill her.

169
00:15:55,525 --> 00:15:56,233
Well then...

170
00:15:56,317 --> 00:15:57,608
you've reached the end...

171
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,108
Too bad.

172
00:15:59,192 --> 00:16:01,942
You are the one who's going
to die, Leonard Testarossa!

173
00:16:03,525 --> 00:16:04,858
It's useless.

174
00:16:16,192 --> 00:16:16,942
Orders, sir?

175
00:16:17,025 --> 00:16:18,608
Start Response A-1.

176
00:16:18,692 --> 00:16:19,983
And be certain of it.

177
00:16:20,067 --> 00:16:21,400
Roger.

178
00:16:41,108 --> 00:16:43,525
Response A-1 complete.

179
00:16:43,608 --> 00:16:45,692
Designated threat
has been neutralized.

180
00:16:45,775 --> 00:16:46,400
Thank you.

181
00:16:46,483 --> 00:16:47,483
Stand by.

182
00:16:47,567 --> 00:16:49,317
Roger.

183
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:52,608
Execute Plan 1-2-1-1, Alastor.

184
00:16:52,692 --> 00:16:54,233
You've just witnessed
the power of the world's

185
00:16:54,317 --> 00:16:56,650
smallest Arm Slave.

186
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,817
I suppose you might already know
that making an autonomous AS

187
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:01,567
is next to impossible.

188
00:17:01,650 --> 00:17:04,400
Miniaturization of the key
components and systems ended up

189
00:17:04,483 --> 00:17:06,483
being a lot of hard work.

190
00:17:06,567 --> 00:17:07,817
So...

191
00:17:07,900 --> 00:17:10,775
THIS is the real reason
I showed up here tonight.

192
00:17:10,858 --> 00:17:12,942
And you saw the unpleasant side.

193
00:17:13,025 --> 00:17:15,525
But -I don't understand
what's going on.

194
00:17:15,608 --> 00:17:16,650
And why...

195
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:17,733
Why what?

196
00:17:17,817 --> 00:17:19,483
You didn't have
to kill her, did you?

197
00:17:19,567 --> 00:17:22,358
Well I certainly didn't
want things to end this way.

198
00:17:22,442 --> 00:17:23,942
She made her own choice.

199
00:17:24,025 --> 00:17:24,567
But you...

200
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,525
Besides, I haven't

201
00:17:26,608 --> 00:17:29,067
killed as many people
as your boyfriend has.

202
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,817
Well that guy...

203
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,942
He's...

204
00:17:34,025 --> 00:17:35,067
been forced to fight
in wars ever since

205
00:17:35,150 --> 00:17:36,650
he was a little child!

206
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,483
He never even had a choice!

207
00:17:38,567 --> 00:17:40,942
All of those he fought
against were bad people.

208
00:17:41,025 --> 00:17:42,942
But he always goes out of
his way to help people

209
00:17:43,025 --> 00:17:44,692
who are weak and innocent!

210
00:17:44,775 --> 00:17:47,983
Unlike you, casually taking
a life for the thrill of it!

211
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:48,775
And still...

212
00:17:48,858 --> 00:17:49,817
you think...

213
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,942
you can compare
yourself to Sousuke?

214
00:17:52,025 --> 00:17:54,317
He's a soldier, not a murderer!

215
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,608
Are you serious?

216
00:17:55,692 --> 00:17:58,483
You can't possibly believe
what you're saying.

217
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:02,317
The essence of our
actions is the same.

218
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,067
And yet I'm the one
you criticize?

219
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,608
You're very partial
to him, aren't you?

220
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,983
No I'm not.

221
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:10,150
You like him.

222
00:18:10,233 --> 00:18:11,192
You're wrong!

223
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:12,233
Oh, really?

224
00:18:12,317 --> 00:18:13,525
Yes, really!

225
00:18:13,608 --> 00:18:14,817
Look at me.

226
00:18:30,775 --> 00:18:31,733
It's all right.

227
00:18:31,817 --> 00:18:32,942
Stand by.

228
00:18:36,275 --> 00:18:37,567
You bastard!

229
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,400
That was a wake-up kiss.

230
00:18:40,317 --> 00:18:42,483
Because I've fallen
in love with you.

231
00:18:42,567 --> 00:18:43,775
I think I'm gonna puke!

232
00:18:43,858 --> 00:18:44,900
You make me sick!

233
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:47,400
That's what I like
about you, see?

234
00:18:47,483 --> 00:18:51,692
Fragile and ferocious, vulgar
and noble at the same time.

235
00:18:51,775 --> 00:18:53,733
You're quite
a compelling enigma.

236
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:55,108
Shut up!

237
00:18:57,317 --> 00:18:58,483
I guess I'd better make

238
00:18:58,567 --> 00:19:01,358
a hasty retreat before
you try to kill me, huh?

239
00:19:03,025 --> 00:19:04,567
W-Wait a minute!

240
00:19:04,650 --> 00:19:06,608
Hmm? What?

241
00:19:06,692 --> 00:19:09,525
I came up here
specifically to talk to him.

242
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:10,900
Leave him here.

243
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:14,067
What reason do I have
to consider that request?

244
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,567
This one.

245
00:19:15,650 --> 00:19:18,525
Leave him here and I'll forgive
you for what you just did.

246
00:19:18,608 --> 00:19:20,817
And you won't
get another chance.

247
00:19:22,817 --> 00:19:24,358
You heard the lady, drop him.

248
00:19:24,442 --> 00:19:25,483
Roger.

249
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,692
One last thing before
I bid you farewell...

250
00:19:30,775 --> 00:19:33,483
I really did fall in love
with you, Kaname Chidori,

251
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,067
and I hope that
you grow to love me...

252
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,358
Until then, I can dream.

253
00:19:47,942 --> 00:19:48,817
Can you move?

254
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:49,858
Are you hurt?

255
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:51,358
It's hard to tell.

256
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:54,525
I think he injected me with
some sort of numbing agent.

257
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,608
Would you like me to help?

258
00:19:56,692 --> 00:19:57,942
No thank you.

259
00:19:58,025 --> 00:19:59,817
Even I have my pride.

260
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:01,192
I'm useless...

261
00:20:01,275 --> 00:20:02,775
what a pitiful state...

262
00:20:02,858 --> 00:20:06,025
I would have been better off
if they had killed me.

263
00:20:06,108 --> 00:20:07,442
I see.

264
00:20:29,317 --> 00:20:30,483
Sousuke...

265
00:20:32,358 --> 00:20:33,608
Why...?

266
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,150
Why aren't you here?

267
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:38,817
You could've put
a stop to all this!

268
00:20:45,567 --> 00:20:48,650
I want it to
get back to normal!

269
00:20:48,733 --> 00:20:51,692
I want you here with me...

270
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:54,817
so you can keep telling me
that "It's not a problem."

271
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:56,567
Oh Sousuke...!

272
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:59,483
So you think you'd
be better off dead, huh?

273
00:22:02,817 --> 00:22:05,817
How about putting up
a little more resistance?

274
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:07,692
I plan to.

275
00:22:07,775 --> 00:22:09,192
Otherwise...

276
00:22:09,275 --> 00:22:11,067
I'm dead.

277
00:23:48,817 --> 00:23:50,192
Why do I fight?

278
00:23:50,275 --> 00:23:51,733
I don't know.

279
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:54,608
My heart is withering, and
my strength is leaving me.

280
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:56,400
With a new mission
ahead on the horizon,

281
00:23:56,483 --> 00:23:59,067
I've lost sight
of everything else.

282
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,525
Next time:
"Two Hong Kongs"

283
00:24:01,608 --> 00:24:04,108
And the scene is a city
burning with chaos.
