1
00:02:00,858 --> 00:02:03,108
Eternal father, strong to save.

2
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:05,858
Whose arm hath bound
the restless wave

3
00:02:05,942 --> 00:02:10,900
Who bids the mighty ocean deep,
its own appointed limits keep...

4
00:02:10,983 --> 00:02:16,192
Oh, hear us when we cry to thee,
for those who peril on the sea.

5
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:18,858
Most holy trinity
of love and power,

6
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:21,400
please shield our brothers
in danger's hour.

7
00:02:21,483 --> 00:02:25,150
From rock and tempest, fire
or foe, protect them please;

8
00:02:25,233 --> 00:02:26,692
wherever they go.

9
00:02:26,775 --> 00:02:29,108
Thus evermore
shall rise to thee...

10
00:02:29,192 --> 00:02:31,483
glad hymns of praise -
from land...

11
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:33,567
and sea.

12
00:02:33,650 --> 00:02:36,483
We are departing immediately
for the operation zone.

13
00:02:36,567 --> 00:02:37,942
Departure stations!

14
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:40,983
These brain waves

15
00:02:41,067 --> 00:02:43,900
in the 30 to 50 hertz range
are called gamma rays.

16
00:02:43,983 --> 00:02:45,900
A Lambda Driver is
capable of generating

17
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,025
a repulsive force field
only when the strength

18
00:02:48,108 --> 00:02:51,067
of these waves exceeds
a certain set level.

19
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,192
However, research up to
this point indicates that it is

20
00:02:54,275 --> 00:02:56,692
difficult for an individual
to generate powerful

21
00:02:56,775 --> 00:03:00,608
gamma waves intentionally,
not to mention continuously.

22
00:03:00,692 --> 00:03:01,858
There is a method

23
00:03:01,942 --> 00:03:03,692
for producing a similar
response artificially...

24
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:07,358
by administering the drug
T-i-970, which is synthesized

25
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:09,650
in very limited quantities.

26
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,067
What does that mean?

27
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:13,442
It means, sergeant that
deploying a Lambda Driver

28
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:16,442
for long periods of time
is next to impossible.

29
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:19,358
Excluding certain cases like
the Behemoth, of course.

30
00:03:19,442 --> 00:03:21,692
In other words, the enemy
will get away with using it

31
00:03:21,775 --> 00:03:23,650
and that makes us
shit out of luck.

32
00:03:23,733 --> 00:03:26,483
Yeah, it doesn't even make
sense to talk about it.

33
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,442
Now hang on a sec, we still
have the Arbalest on our side.

34
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:31,150
Yeah, but we can't afford
another startup failure

35
00:03:31,233 --> 00:03:33,358
like we had in Nanking.

36
00:04:20,692 --> 00:04:21,650
Hi, Al.

37
00:04:21,733 --> 00:04:24,358
Confirming:
Sergeant Sousuke Sagara.

38
00:04:24,442 --> 00:04:25,192
Initialized.

39
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:26,608
How are you today?

40
00:04:26,692 --> 00:04:31,400
Today's PMCS at 1730 hours
was rated as satisfactory.

41
00:04:31,483 --> 00:04:33,650
Lieutenant Sachs
was the duty officer.

42
00:04:33,733 --> 00:04:41,025
The maintenance record number
is 051021-01B-F-001.

43
00:04:41,108 --> 00:04:43,275
Would you like
to view this record?

44
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,400
If you would like to perform
an additional check,

45
00:04:46,483 --> 00:04:48,608
you will need to change
the current settings.

46
00:04:48,692 --> 00:04:50,650
End the current
training mode, connect to

47
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:53,108
an external power source,
then engage the secondary.

48
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:53,983
Okay, I get it.

49
00:04:54,067 --> 00:04:56,067
I only woke you up on a whim.

50
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:58,650
Training message:
Explanation needed regarding

51
00:04:58,733 --> 00:05:00,525
the word "whim."

52
00:05:00,608 --> 00:05:02,858
Try deducing it on your own, Al.

53
00:05:02,942 --> 00:05:03,650
Roger.

54
00:05:03,733 --> 00:05:04,567
Complete.

55
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:05,983
Shall I show you the results?

56
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:07,317
Go ahead.

57
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,942
Regarding the meaning of
"whim." Most likely match:

58
00:05:10,025 --> 00:05:12,733
A concept similar to
"discretion" or "doubt."

59
00:05:12,817 --> 00:05:15,942
Second possible match: A
concept similar to "enthusiasm"

60
00:05:16,025 --> 00:05:17,358
or "diligence."

61
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:19,733
Third possible match: A
concept similar to "disorder"

62
00:05:19,817 --> 00:05:21,067
or "erratic."

63
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:24,192
Fourth possible match: A
concept similar to "play."

64
00:05:24,275 --> 00:05:25,775
You know what "playing" is?

65
00:05:25,858 --> 00:05:26,733
Affirmative.

66
00:05:26,817 --> 00:05:28,817
Is that the concept of "whim"?

67
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,817
It's close to
"play" and "erratic."

68
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,692
Roger.

69
00:05:31,775 --> 00:05:33,608
Thank you for your cooperation.

70
00:05:33,692 --> 00:05:35,567
Who taught you
what "playing" is?

71
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,442
It was Senior engineer
Bani Morauta.

72
00:05:38,525 --> 00:05:40,692
And he was the
engineer who made you?

73
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:42,192
Affirmative.

74
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,733
Your lousy father, huh?

75
00:05:44,817 --> 00:05:45,942
Training message.

76
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:48,233
What is the meaning of "lousy"?

77
00:05:48,317 --> 00:05:51,608
Stop saying "training message"
every time you have a question.

78
00:05:51,692 --> 00:05:54,983
"Lousy" is a weapon system
that only works when it wants.

79
00:05:55,067 --> 00:05:56,525
In other words, you.

80
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:57,483
Affirmative.

81
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,525
The ARX system is incomplete.

82
00:06:00,608 --> 00:06:01,858
You agree with me?

83
00:06:01,942 --> 00:06:02,900
Affirmative.

84
00:06:02,983 --> 00:06:05,317
You are a component
of the failure.

85
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,900
What did you say?

86
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:09,692
The ARX system cannot
fully function without

87
00:06:09,775 --> 00:06:11,608
your complete cooperation.

88
00:06:11,692 --> 00:06:14,442
You are part of
the system, Sergeant.

89
00:06:14,525 --> 00:06:16,817
If you can explain your
current problem to me,

90
00:06:16,900 --> 00:06:18,858
I may be able to
give you advice.

91
00:06:18,942 --> 00:06:21,108
Please proceed.

92
00:06:21,192 --> 00:06:22,150
Advice?

93
00:06:22,233 --> 00:06:23,525
From an A.I.?

94
00:06:23,608 --> 00:06:24,567
Affirmative.

95
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:26,483
I am not experiencing
any problem.

96
00:06:26,567 --> 00:06:27,942
I do not agree, Sergeant.

97
00:06:28,025 --> 00:06:28,775
Why not?

98
00:06:28,858 --> 00:06:30,442
My intuition says otherwise.

99
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:31,817
Intuition?

100
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:34,525
Who the hell even taught you
the word "intuition?"

101
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:37,817
Maybe you should tell your
"intuition" its accusations

102
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:39,358
are off-base.

103
00:06:39,442 --> 00:06:41,192
Your order is nonsense.

104
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,358
"Intuition"
cannot be controlled,

105
00:06:43,442 --> 00:06:45,275
ordered or persuaded.

106
00:06:45,358 --> 00:06:47,983
It comes from within the soul.

107
00:06:48,067 --> 00:06:49,192
It's quite obvious that

108
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:50,817
you're the one who's
and full of nonsense.

109
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,650
Stop kidding around!

110
00:06:51,733 --> 00:06:52,692
Sousuke?

111
00:06:52,775 --> 00:06:54,650
Hey Sousuke, are you up there?

112
00:06:54,733 --> 00:06:55,983
Yeah, What is it?

113
00:06:56,067 --> 00:06:58,983
Commander Kalinin wants us
for a mission briefing.

114
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,608
A Mission.

115
00:07:02,275 --> 00:07:04,525
I believe you've already
heard about this, but an AS

116
00:07:04,608 --> 00:07:07,608
of unknown affiliation
has appeared in Hong Kong.

117
00:07:07,692 --> 00:07:11,108
This lone, renegade unit has
caused widespread destruction

118
00:07:11,192 --> 00:07:14,108
and we believe it's
hiding within city limits.

119
00:07:14,192 --> 00:07:18,108
Both the North and South Chinese
armies have taken casualties.

120
00:07:18,192 --> 00:07:21,942
This, in addition to the Nanking
incident, has pushed tensions

121
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:24,108
to a breaking point.

122
00:07:24,192 --> 00:07:26,858
If conditions keep
deteriorating, it could lead

123
00:07:26,942 --> 00:07:29,400
to the dissolution
of the peace treaty.

124
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,817
And Hong Kong would become
the inevitable battleground.

125
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:35,692
Lieutenant Clouseau
will take it from here.

126
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:37,400
Take a look at that.

127
00:07:38,442 --> 00:07:41,483
This photograph was taken
26 hours ago near Yau Ma Tei

128
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:43,233
on the Kowloon peninsula.

129
00:07:43,317 --> 00:07:44,483
We believe it's probably

130
00:07:44,567 --> 00:07:47,483
the same machine we
fought in Helmajistan.

131
00:07:47,567 --> 00:07:50,525
After destroying a South Chinese
tank, it used a smoke bomb

132
00:07:50,608 --> 00:07:52,233
to cover its escape.

133
00:07:52,317 --> 00:07:55,317
Since then, it's appeared then
disappeared in various places

134
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:58,025
in Hong Kong and Kowloon,
continuing to destroy

135
00:07:58,108 --> 00:07:59,525
anything in its path.

136
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:02,067
Close to 10 AS units
have been destroyed,

137
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,692
and there have been
numerous casualties.

138
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:06,525
The bottom line is
they can't find it

139
00:08:06,608 --> 00:08:08,692
and they can't kill it, either.

140
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,150
Considering what
we've seen in the past,

141
00:08:11,233 --> 00:08:13,983
we believe this machine probably
has an ECS that's as good

142
00:08:14,067 --> 00:08:16,108
as ours if not superior.

143
00:08:16,192 --> 00:08:17,817
What's this terrorist after?

144
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:19,067
Unknown.

145
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:20,900
And no one's talking.

146
00:08:20,983 --> 00:08:23,733
An educated guess says
wrecking the peace treaty,

147
00:08:23,817 --> 00:08:25,942
or Hong Kong's economy.

148
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:29,942
But then, this whole thing
could be directed at us.

149
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:32,483
Regardless of what
kind of AS it is...

150
00:08:32,567 --> 00:08:35,025
it can't run
longer than 24 hours.

151
00:08:35,108 --> 00:08:36,817
The machine
requires maintenance,

152
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:39,442
the weapons need to be
reloaded with fresh rounds,

153
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:41,983
and the operator needs to rest.

154
00:08:42,067 --> 00:08:45,108
We have to find this arm
slave quickly then send in

155
00:08:45,192 --> 00:08:49,317
an M9 platoon in stealth mode
to pacify the situation.

156
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:52,067
And I'll need every one of
you to run reconnaissance.

157
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,400
Reconnaissance?

158
00:08:53,483 --> 00:08:55,025
We're coordinating with
the Intelligence Division

159
00:08:55,108 --> 00:08:56,275
in Hong Kong.

160
00:08:56,358 --> 00:08:58,358
They know the politics
and the lay of the land,

161
00:08:58,442 --> 00:09:00,025
so consider them an asset.

162
00:09:00,108 --> 00:09:02,567
You'll leave by helicopter
under cover of night.

163
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:05,108
We need to get you
there before the M9s.

164
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,525
Does that include Sousuke?

165
00:09:06,608 --> 00:09:08,025
It does.

166
00:09:08,108 --> 00:09:09,442
Sir, but don't you think we
should have him standing by

167
00:09:09,525 --> 00:09:10,942
with the Arbalest?

168
00:09:11,025 --> 00:09:12,858
The plan for this mission
doesn't call for deployment

169
00:09:12,942 --> 00:09:14,400
of the Arbalest, Major Mao.

170
00:09:14,483 --> 00:09:15,025
But why?

171
00:09:15,108 --> 00:09:17,108
It's not reliable!

172
00:10:39,733 --> 00:10:40,858
When I look at it from up here,

173
00:10:40,942 --> 00:10:43,233
it really hasn't
changed that much.

174
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:44,567
You've been here before?

175
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:47,233
A few times before
the mainland took over.

176
00:10:47,317 --> 00:10:49,317
Some of the relatives
on my mom's side used to

177
00:10:49,400 --> 00:10:51,025
live in this part of town.

178
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:53,358
I freeloaded off of 'em
for a couple months before

179
00:10:53,442 --> 00:10:55,233
I hooked up with Mithril.

180
00:10:55,317 --> 00:10:56,192
Total slacker.

181
00:10:56,275 --> 00:10:56,900
You?

182
00:10:56,983 --> 00:10:58,317
A slacker?

183
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,608
For starters, I got myself
kicked out of the Marines.

184
00:11:00,692 --> 00:11:02,817
And the thought of going to
work in New York so I could live

185
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:05,275
with my parents was
out of the question.

186
00:11:05,358 --> 00:11:07,650
My dad was always on my ass.

187
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,358
That Air Force bastard...

188
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:11,525
Your father was a military man?

189
00:11:11,608 --> 00:11:12,358
Yep.

190
00:11:12,442 --> 00:11:14,483
A chickenshit bomber pilot.

191
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,692
But he retired and
he's running a company now.

192
00:11:17,775 --> 00:11:20,858
He's a tightwad, cocky bastard,
and on top of that...

193
00:11:20,942 --> 00:11:22,733
he's always plotting something.

194
00:11:22,817 --> 00:11:24,275
Like what?

195
00:11:24,358 --> 00:11:26,692
Well, when I graduated high
school and was looking for work,

196
00:11:26,775 --> 00:11:28,775
he pulled a bunch of strings
to try to get me married

197
00:11:28,858 --> 00:11:32,150
to some rich jackass who'd
just graduated from Harvard.

198
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:34,400
That really pissed
me off, ya know?!

199
00:11:34,483 --> 00:11:36,692
So on the day that I was
supposed to get married,

200
00:11:36,775 --> 00:11:39,067
I ran away and joined
the Marines instead.

201
00:11:39,150 --> 00:11:40,858
No way!

202
00:11:40,942 --> 00:11:41,358
Yeah...

203
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:42,817
I'm serious!

204
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:44,650
I snuck out of the chapel
and ran to the recruiter...

205
00:11:44,733 --> 00:11:46,900
I was still wearing
my wedding dress.

206
00:11:46,983 --> 00:11:49,983
The guy behind the desk got this
goofy look on face and said...

207
00:11:50,067 --> 00:11:53,483
"are you serious?"
"You're god damn right!" I said!

208
00:11:53,567 --> 00:11:55,858
And of course, they all
tried to talk me out of it.

209
00:11:55,942 --> 00:11:57,192
"Come on now,

210
00:11:57,275 --> 00:11:59,275
you'd be happier if
you got married instead!"

211
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:01,525
"Won't your mom and dad
be worried about you?"

212
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,400
So I then told them, "Nah... "

213
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:06,192
My dad's in the Air Force.
"When they heard that,

214
00:12:06,275 --> 00:12:07,400
they had a change of heart!

215
00:12:07,483 --> 00:12:09,192
"Why didn't you say that
in the first place?

216
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:10,900
Sign right here, honey!"

217
00:12:12,733 --> 00:12:14,817
So, how does that grab ya?

218
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,275
Oh God!

219
00:12:16,358 --> 00:12:17,608
That's freakin' awesome!

220
00:12:17,692 --> 00:12:18,567
I love 'er?!

221
00:12:18,650 --> 00:12:20,192
Unbelievable!

222
00:12:21,733 --> 00:12:23,067
Isn't that great?

223
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:27,567
All things considered,
it really was a great time...

224
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,608
The moment I made
that decision I felt like

225
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:31,900
the whole world
opened up to me.

226
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:33,442
It felt like
I could do anything,

227
00:12:33,525 --> 00:12:35,483
and go anywhere, you know?

228
00:12:36,942 --> 00:12:39,442
Why didn't you?

229
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:42,442
Well, a lot's happened
since then, Sousuke.

230
00:12:42,525 --> 00:12:45,650
Frustration, danger,
disappointment...

231
00:12:45,733 --> 00:12:48,733
But I really think I did
the right thing back then...

232
00:12:48,817 --> 00:12:52,650
I can definitely say I like
myself more than I used to.

233
00:12:52,733 --> 00:12:54,858
So there, that's my story.

234
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:58,983
Anyway, coming back to the
city triggered a few memories,

235
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:01,067
but don't read
too much into it, okay?

236
00:13:03,150 --> 00:13:03,775
Phew!

237
00:13:03,858 --> 00:13:05,358
Apologies for the wait.

238
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:09,067
I'm Mr. Hunter with Hong
Kong's Intelligence Division.

239
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,983
Now this goes
without saying, but...

240
00:13:14,067 --> 00:13:16,317
both the Northern and
Southern armies have been

241
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,358
getting downright nervous.

242
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:19,650
We'll have to move covertly

243
00:13:19,733 --> 00:13:22,817
and avoid provoking
anyone from either side.

244
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,275
Security's tight and both
armies have stopped traffic

245
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:26,817
at the border.

246
00:13:26,900 --> 00:13:29,775
The harbor is closed and most
flights have been cancelled.

247
00:13:29,858 --> 00:13:30,942
And let me tell you,

248
00:13:31,025 --> 00:13:33,150
it's playing hell
with their stock market.

249
00:13:33,233 --> 00:13:35,775
People are feeling a little
trapped at the moment.

250
00:13:35,858 --> 00:13:37,817
what about the AS
causing this mess?

251
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,942
Well, we haven't been able
to observe it long enough

252
00:13:40,025 --> 00:13:41,733
to get a fix on it yet.

253
00:13:41,817 --> 00:13:44,525
It's last appearance was
at 1015 hours, in the town

254
00:13:44,608 --> 00:13:46,525
of Shau Kei Wan in Hong Kong.

255
00:13:46,608 --> 00:13:47,775
And you're absolutely sure

256
00:13:47,858 --> 00:13:49,775
it's hiding somewhere
in Hong Kong, correct?

257
00:13:49,858 --> 00:13:51,775
I really can't confirm anything,

258
00:13:51,858 --> 00:13:55,108
but our analysts and artificial
intelligence seem to think so.

259
00:13:55,192 --> 00:13:57,983
And a lifetime of using
THIS doesn't hurt!

260
00:13:58,067 --> 00:14:00,983
We took the liberty of
pinpointing possible locations.

261
00:14:01,942 --> 00:14:03,942
So what do you think?

262
00:14:06,817 --> 00:14:09,650
Excluding the suburbs
and small islands,

263
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,400
we'll get aerial recon
using the choppers.

264
00:14:12,483 --> 00:14:15,942
Anti-ECS sensors are going
to be useless in urban areas

265
00:14:16,025 --> 00:14:18,400
so we'll have to go
street by street.

266
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:20,275
And we can cross off
any place that has a lot

267
00:14:20,358 --> 00:14:22,067
of doves and crows.

268
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,442
Why birds?

269
00:14:23,525 --> 00:14:26,150
It seems that birds can
still see a cloaked AS unit.

270
00:14:26,233 --> 00:14:28,942
Most likely because the
ECS system can't mask out

271
00:14:29,025 --> 00:14:30,358
the ultraviolet light.

272
00:14:30,442 --> 00:14:33,192
Crows start screeching
like hell they're near one.

273
00:14:33,275 --> 00:14:35,150
And dogs go nuts.

274
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,817
They're sensitive
to the ECS's ozone smell.

275
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,400
I see.

276
00:14:39,483 --> 00:14:40,983
Anything else?

277
00:14:42,775 --> 00:14:44,650
Well, that's all I can think of.

278
00:14:46,775 --> 00:14:49,358
Hey, Sousuke?!

279
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,817
Do you have anything?

280
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,025
No.

281
00:14:52,108 --> 00:14:53,692
Not really.

282
00:14:55,650 --> 00:14:58,067
Hmmm, this looks
a lot more promising.

283
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:01,150
That narrows it down to
49 locations in Hong Kong

284
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,358
plus another 78
locations in Kowloon.

285
00:15:03,442 --> 00:15:07,025
If we divide the search equally,
we could get it done in a day.

286
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:09,400
If conditions are
favorable, of course.

287
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,525
Man...

288
00:15:14,608 --> 00:15:17,775
Hunter sure has his hand in a
lot of businesses around here.

289
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:21,900
Okay, time to start moving out.

290
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:24,483
Martial law's in effect,
so watch it.

291
00:15:24,567 --> 00:15:27,608
What if the police or the
army stop us at a checkpoint?

292
00:15:27,692 --> 00:15:30,733
That Hunter guy can't be
in everyone's back pocket...

293
00:15:30,817 --> 00:15:31,817
That's true.

294
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:33,733
So if you can run, run away.

295
00:15:33,817 --> 00:15:35,525
But no firefights
with the locals.

296
00:15:35,608 --> 00:15:37,775
It's not their fault
they're in this mess.

297
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:39,275
If they catch you,
you're probably in for

298
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:42,525
a tough interrogation until
Hunter pulls some strings.

299
00:15:42,608 --> 00:15:44,900
And you better keep your mouth
shut even if they torture you.

300
00:15:44,983 --> 00:15:45,692
Got it?

301
00:15:45,775 --> 00:15:47,025
Man, you're pretty harsh.

302
00:15:47,108 --> 00:15:48,567
And another thing,
you better think about

303
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:50,858
what you're going to
do if you spot the enemy.

304
00:15:50,942 --> 00:15:52,108
I won't allow anyone

305
00:15:52,192 --> 00:15:54,358
dying out there without
getting my permission.

306
00:15:54,442 --> 00:15:55,233
Understood?

307
00:15:55,317 --> 00:15:56,525
Roger that.

308
00:16:25,900 --> 00:16:27,025
Look at that...

309
00:16:27,108 --> 00:16:29,733
I've never seen this
street so barren before.

310
00:16:51,233 --> 00:16:53,942
Damn, you think they're
gonna hassle us, too?

311
00:16:54,025 --> 00:16:56,317
Hunter's contacts
better be good.

312
00:16:58,150 --> 00:16:59,567
It's up to you, Mao.

313
00:17:01,983 --> 00:17:04,233
My Chinese is fine,
roll it down.

314
00:17:35,608 --> 00:17:36,858
This is crazy.

315
00:17:36,942 --> 00:17:39,317
I didn't think I'd ever
see this tunnel so empty.

316
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,150
Really...

317
00:17:41,233 --> 00:17:43,358
Anyone who knew what
Hong Kong was like before this

318
00:17:43,442 --> 00:17:45,317
would be shocked.

319
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,775
Think about it for a minute.

320
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,025
What if Tokyo
ended up like this?

321
00:17:49,108 --> 00:17:51,775
Shinjuku and Ginza,
split right down the middle,

322
00:17:51,858 --> 00:17:54,192
and right on the brink
of war with each other.

323
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,608
Like, instead of shopping
arcades filled with kids eating

324
00:17:56,692 --> 00:17:59,358
ice cream and stuff, they'd
be lined from stem to stern

325
00:17:59,442 --> 00:18:01,400
with tanks and arm slaves.

326
00:18:01,483 --> 00:18:04,025
And instead of taking
quiet walks on the bayside,

327
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:07,442
you'd be ducking and dodging
through pillboxes and bunkers.

328
00:18:07,525 --> 00:18:10,817
I mean, THIS is not the
Hong Kong that I know and love.

329
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:11,317
It's...

330
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:13,233
just insane.

331
00:18:15,192 --> 00:18:16,858
Hey, Sousuke?

332
00:18:16,942 --> 00:18:17,858
What's wrong?

333
00:18:17,942 --> 00:18:18,567
It's...

334
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,275
nothing really.

335
00:18:36,442 --> 00:18:37,733
I'm impressed.

336
00:18:37,817 --> 00:18:40,525
The Southern Army's
letting us pass, also.

337
00:18:42,775 --> 00:18:45,733
I guess Hunter
really is a big shot, huh?

338
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,608
We're almost at
the destination.

339
00:19:21,692 --> 00:19:24,483
What should we do if we hit
the jackpot right off the bat?

340
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:25,608
Not a problem.

341
00:19:25,692 --> 00:19:27,025
We can handle it.

342
00:19:33,983 --> 00:19:35,317
Sagara, calm down!

343
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,608
You're confused
and having delusions!

344
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:38,108
Sagara!

345
00:19:38,192 --> 00:19:39,775
Yo, Sagara!

346
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:53,775
Just let me take care of this
and don't you say a word!

347
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:54,942
I'm sorry...

348
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:56,983
I told you to shut
your mouth, didn't I?!

349
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,608
Souske!

350
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:21,108
Lucky for us, the local army
found bigger fish to fry.

351
00:21:21,192 --> 00:21:22,900
Let's move it.

352
00:21:22,983 --> 00:21:24,442
What the hell were you thinking?

353
00:21:24,525 --> 00:21:26,108
Tryin' to get us killed?

354
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,150
Sorry.

355
00:21:29,233 --> 00:21:31,275
You're still thinking
about Kaname, aren't you?

356
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:34,608
All right, that's enough!

357
00:21:34,692 --> 00:21:36,108
Either you pull your
head out of your ass

358
00:21:36,192 --> 00:21:38,233
or you get the hell
out of the van!

359
00:21:39,442 --> 00:21:40,692
I know it bugs you.

360
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:42,483
But right now I can't play

361
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:44,608
the "big sister"
role for you, okay?!

362
00:21:44,692 --> 00:21:47,650
I am NOT ready to die out here!

363
00:21:47,733 --> 00:21:51,192
I mean, with the state
you're in, I'm better off alone!

364
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:56,108
You're right.

365
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,775
Sousuke?

366
00:21:57,858 --> 00:21:59,400
Sorry.

367
00:21:59,483 --> 00:22:01,858
but I can't do this anymore.

368
00:22:01,942 --> 00:22:03,733
Continue the mission.

369
00:23:47,317 --> 00:23:48,775
Abandoning my mission.

370
00:23:48,858 --> 00:23:50,150
Having lost sight of everything,

371
00:23:50,233 --> 00:23:52,192
I wander the streets
of Hong Kong.

372
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:53,817
I don't have any place to go,

373
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:56,942
or even the skill to
take refuge in depravity.

374
00:23:57,025 --> 00:23:57,983
Next time...

375
00:23:58,067 --> 00:24:00,900
"His Problem" I feel nothing...

376
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:03,067
except this escalating tension.
