1
00:02:02,192 --> 00:02:04,525
Argos 4, this is
Merida final controller.

2
00:02:04,608 --> 00:02:05,567
Your heading is good.

3
00:02:05,650 --> 00:02:08,233
Glide path is satisfactory.

4
00:02:08,317 --> 00:02:09,400
This is Argos 4.

5
00:02:09,483 --> 00:02:11,692
I have visual on the runway.

6
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:14,650
Copy that Argos 4,
landing clearance granted.

7
00:02:30,358 --> 00:02:31,692
Steady...

8
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:40,358
Lieutenant, your signature.

9
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:41,775
Sure.

10
00:02:47,275 --> 00:02:49,858
Should I have your duffle bag
sent directly to your room, sir?

11
00:02:49,942 --> 00:02:50,775
Yes, please.

12
00:02:50,858 --> 00:02:52,025
I've got work.

13
00:02:52,108 --> 00:02:53,192
Yes, sir.

14
00:03:21,317 --> 00:03:22,442
Yes?

15
00:03:22,525 --> 00:03:25,233
Captain,
Sergeant Sagara is here.

16
00:03:25,317 --> 00:03:26,608
Yes, please send him in.

17
00:03:26,692 --> 00:03:27,858
Yes, ma'am.

18
00:03:32,692 --> 00:03:34,525
Come in.

19
00:03:34,608 --> 00:03:36,400
Pardon me, Captain.

20
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,483
Sergeant Sousuke Sagara,
returning from temporary duty.

21
00:03:45,567 --> 00:03:46,858
Yes, good work.

22
00:03:46,942 --> 00:03:48,650
At ease, Sergeant.

23
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:50,192
Yes, ma'am.

24
00:03:57,025 --> 00:03:59,733
So did you get a chance to tell
her goodbye before you left?

25
00:03:59,817 --> 00:04:01,608
No.

26
00:04:01,692 --> 00:04:05,067
Do you have something
you'd like to say to me?

27
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:05,650
No.

28
00:04:05,733 --> 00:04:07,150
Nothing.

29
00:04:07,233 --> 00:04:09,775
Both the Pacific Fleet Commander
and I made the decision

30
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:11,900
to recall you from Tokyo.

31
00:04:11,983 --> 00:04:14,275
Mission parameters were already
in place to have an agent

32
00:04:14,358 --> 00:04:16,692
from Intelligence permanently
assigned to her protection,

33
00:04:16,775 --> 00:04:17,733
Sergeant.

34
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:20,983
What about document
file 05B-D113?

35
00:04:21,067 --> 00:04:22,650
What document is that?

36
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:24,442
It's my report on Wraith.

37
00:04:24,525 --> 00:04:25,983
Intelligence has been
delinquent in their

38
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:28,150
protection of Chidori, ma'am.

39
00:04:28,233 --> 00:04:30,400
I've stated this
on many occasions.

40
00:04:30,483 --> 00:04:32,775
That is strictly your opinion,
Sergeant Sagara.

41
00:04:32,858 --> 00:04:36,025
Are you doubting
the facts in my report?

42
00:04:36,108 --> 00:04:37,400
No, that's hardly the case.

43
00:04:37,483 --> 00:04:38,817
I used many factors
to make my de...

44
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,608
But their measures
are weak and inadequate!

45
00:04:40,692 --> 00:04:42,192
That makes them
nothing more than...

46
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:43,608
observers.

47
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:44,900
If I were in your shoes,

48
00:04:44,983 --> 00:04:47,442
I'd consider dialing
it down a notch or two...

49
00:04:47,525 --> 00:04:48,483
Sergeant.

50
00:04:48,567 --> 00:04:49,692
Last time I checked,

51
00:04:49,775 --> 00:04:51,983
you had other duties
to perform, did you not?

52
00:04:52,067 --> 00:04:53,358
And what duties are those?

53
00:04:53,442 --> 00:04:54,858
The Arbalest.

54
00:04:55,942 --> 00:04:58,775
You are to give that machine
your undivided attention.

55
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,317
After that kidnapping incident,
the Arbalest was optimized

56
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,692
for the first person who
had piloted the machine.

57
00:05:03,775 --> 00:05:05,233
In other words, you.

58
00:05:05,317 --> 00:05:07,608
But the Arbalest's developer
has died, and only he knew how

59
00:05:07,692 --> 00:05:10,025
to change the artificial
intelligence settings.

60
00:05:10,108 --> 00:05:11,942
And since then,
through trial and error,

61
00:05:12,025 --> 00:05:14,233
just about all we've been
able to determine is that the

62
00:05:14,317 --> 00:05:17,983
Lambda Driver will activate for
you--but not for anyone else.

63
00:05:18,067 --> 00:05:21,400
However, "Amalgam" or whoever
they are have successfully used

64
00:05:21,483 --> 00:05:23,233
the Lambda Driver many times.

65
00:05:23,317 --> 00:05:25,900
Just like they did
in Nanking the other day.

66
00:05:25,983 --> 00:05:28,650
So the only way we can
even hope to defeat them...

67
00:05:28,733 --> 00:05:31,150
is to re-team you
with Arbalest!

68
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:35,150
You are to leave the guard of
Kaname Chidori to Intelligence,

69
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:38,108
and devote yourself exclusively
to mastering that machine,

70
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:39,525
understood?

71
00:05:41,983 --> 00:05:44,567
So I guess I don't
have a choice, do I?

72
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:45,942
No.

73
00:05:46,025 --> 00:05:46,942
Sagara...

74
00:05:47,025 --> 00:05:48,733
please let go and move on.

75
00:05:48,817 --> 00:05:50,858
Should I take that
as an order, Captain?

76
00:05:51,858 --> 00:05:53,317
Sergeant...

77
00:05:56,192 --> 00:05:57,317
Yes...

78
00:05:57,400 --> 00:05:58,983
you should.

79
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:00,817
You want me to say
it's an order, fine!

80
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,108
I'll say it's an order,
Sergeant Sagara!

81
00:06:03,192 --> 00:06:04,733
..if that's what it's
going to take to get you

82
00:06:04,817 --> 00:06:07,233
out of Kaname Chidori's life!

83
00:06:07,317 --> 00:06:09,108
It's so easy for you, isn't it?

84
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,108
You're just going to stand
there angry and hold a grudge

85
00:06:11,192 --> 00:06:12,400
against me...

86
00:06:12,483 --> 00:06:13,567
But I have to look out for

87
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,733
the safety of EVERYONE
under my command!

88
00:06:15,817 --> 00:06:17,817
Do you know how
strong the enemy is?

89
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,733
Melissa might die
out there next time!

90
00:06:19,817 --> 00:06:21,192
Or Mr. Weber!

91
00:06:21,275 --> 00:06:23,692
You have absolutely no
idea what it's like for me

92
00:06:23,775 --> 00:06:25,525
when I'm sitting in
that captain's chair!!

93
00:06:25,608 --> 00:06:27,442
Well it isn't easy!

94
00:06:27,525 --> 00:06:29,233
Get that look off your face!

95
00:06:29,317 --> 00:06:31,608
You're still thinking
about HER, aren't you?

96
00:06:31,692 --> 00:06:34,442
Have you ever thought to stop
and consider MY feelings?

97
00:06:34,525 --> 00:06:35,317
Captain...

98
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,650
You're disgusting!

99
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:39,317
You put up a front like
you're obedient and kind,

100
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,025
but you're cruel
and self-centered!

101
00:06:42,108 --> 00:06:43,983
And on top of that
you're lying to yourself.

102
00:06:44,067 --> 00:06:45,983
Why don't you just come
right out and say it?

103
00:06:46,067 --> 00:06:48,025
"I want to be with Kaname!

104
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,442
So stay out of the way!"

105
00:06:52,567 --> 00:06:56,442
It would've been easier...
if you'd said it.

106
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,317
Yes?

107
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:16,775
Captain, Lieutenant Clouseau
is here to see you.

108
00:07:16,858 --> 00:07:18,400
Please have him
wait for a moment.

109
00:07:18,483 --> 00:07:20,567
I'll call him in shortly.

110
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:22,858
Yes, ma'am.

111
00:07:22,942 --> 00:07:23,858
I...

112
00:07:23,942 --> 00:07:24,775
hate you...

113
00:07:24,858 --> 00:07:26,025
Mr. Sagara.

114
00:07:26,108 --> 00:07:27,192
I'm sorry.

115
00:07:27,275 --> 00:07:29,317
You always say that
out of convenience--

116
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,942
never out of sincerity.

117
00:07:31,025 --> 00:07:32,192
I mean it.

118
00:07:33,567 --> 00:07:35,817
I don't have anything
else to discuss with you.

119
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,442
You're dismissed.

120
00:07:37,525 --> 00:07:38,817
'Ma'am.

121
00:07:48,608 --> 00:07:49,733
So who was that?

122
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,358
That's Sergeant Sagara.

123
00:07:51,442 --> 00:07:53,067
He's from the SRT.

124
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:55,650
Yes?

125
00:07:55,733 --> 00:07:57,400
Hmph...

126
00:07:57,483 --> 00:07:58,233
Okay.

127
00:07:58,317 --> 00:08:00,108
The Captain can see you now.

128
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:01,233
Thanks.

129
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:06,483
Lieutenant Belfangan Clouseau,

130
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:08,692
here to report
for duty, Captain.

131
00:08:08,775 --> 00:08:11,317
I'd like to welcome to
the West Pacific Fleet.

132
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,150
Please...

133
00:08:12,233 --> 00:08:13,608
at ease, Lieutenant.

134
00:08:13,692 --> 00:08:14,983
Yes, ma'am.

135
00:08:15,067 --> 00:08:16,983
Your reputation precedes you,
Captain Testarossa.

136
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,858
I'm very honored
to meet you, ma'am.

137
00:08:18,942 --> 00:08:20,233
I could say the same.

138
00:08:20,317 --> 00:08:22,775
Have you had a chance to
meet your new subordinates?

139
00:08:22,858 --> 00:08:24,775
No, I can't say that I have.

140
00:08:24,858 --> 00:08:26,233
Instead of a
formal introduction,

141
00:08:26,317 --> 00:08:28,650
I'd rather "test them out",
so to speak.

142
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:30,067
You want to "test" them?

143
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,775
Yes ma'am, I need to see
what they're made of.

144
00:08:35,608 --> 00:08:37,692
She started crying?

145
00:08:37,775 --> 00:08:38,525
Yeah.

146
00:08:38,608 --> 00:08:40,442
You dog, you!

147
00:08:40,525 --> 00:08:43,108
You're gonna make a hell of
a gigolo one of these days!

148
00:08:43,192 --> 00:08:44,692
What is a "gigolo"?

149
00:08:44,775 --> 00:08:46,608
Ah, nothin'.

150
00:08:46,692 --> 00:08:48,608
But anyway...

151
00:08:48,692 --> 00:08:50,525
That's pretty impressive, man!

152
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:52,483
You're really enjoying this,
aren't you?

153
00:08:52,567 --> 00:08:53,817
You know it.

154
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:58,108
The captain's
assertion was correct.

155
00:08:58,192 --> 00:08:59,650
There's certainly no
rational reason for me

156
00:08:59,733 --> 00:09:02,067
to feel compelled
to guard Chidori.

157
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:04,025
Considering that the right
person should be assigned

158
00:09:04,108 --> 00:09:07,858
to the job it's odd
that I made it this far.

159
00:09:07,942 --> 00:09:09,025
Yep.

160
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:11,108
Like a square peg
in a round hole, man.

161
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:12,692
Yeah, but still...

162
00:09:12,775 --> 00:09:13,817
But what?

163
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:15,442
I just wonder...

164
00:09:15,525 --> 00:09:18,150
Get to the point, huh?

165
00:09:20,233 --> 00:09:22,192
No, forget it.

166
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,400
Sousuke!

167
00:09:23,483 --> 00:09:24,942
What's the matter with you?

168
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:27,192
Come on brother, it's me!

169
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:28,108
It's okay.

170
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,025
Spit it out!

171
00:09:29,108 --> 00:09:31,108
You'll feel a lot better.

172
00:09:35,067 --> 00:09:36,483
Who's the new guy?

173
00:09:41,150 --> 00:09:42,233
Water, please.

174
00:09:42,317 --> 00:09:43,608
Yeah right, funny guy.

175
00:09:43,692 --> 00:09:44,692
Try somethin' harder.

176
00:09:44,775 --> 00:09:45,900
You heard me.

177
00:09:45,983 --> 00:09:47,525
Water.

178
00:09:47,608 --> 00:09:49,192
Yeah, whatever...

179
00:09:51,233 --> 00:09:52,400
Here ya go, partner.

180
00:09:52,483 --> 00:09:54,233
Enjoy...

181
00:09:54,317 --> 00:09:56,525
Uuh, pardon me, lieutenant.

182
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:58,983
I don't really mean to come
off sounding like a jerk

183
00:09:59,067 --> 00:10:00,775
or anything, but...

184
00:10:00,858 --> 00:10:02,608
you think you could
find another seat?

185
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:03,817
Why should I?

186
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:07,442
Because these three
seats belong to the SRT.

187
00:10:07,525 --> 00:10:10,692
And as far as I know, you're not
with the Special Response Team.

188
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,733
So we need you to
sit somewhere else.

189
00:10:12,817 --> 00:10:14,775
What, is that a regulation?

190
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,733
Naaah, nothin' like that...

191
00:10:16,817 --> 00:10:19,900
The guys at the base just
decided it on their own.

192
00:10:19,983 --> 00:10:22,067
So yeah, I guess you could
call those seats reserved

193
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,567
if you wanted to.

194
00:10:23,650 --> 00:10:25,358
That's ridiculous.

195
00:10:25,442 --> 00:10:28,942
Look, that's the seat our
dead C.O. always sat in.

196
00:10:29,025 --> 00:10:31,358
Sorry, but we don't want
your ass sitting there when

197
00:10:31,442 --> 00:10:33,733
we've never even
seen you before, got it?

198
00:10:33,817 --> 00:10:35,108
Okay.

199
00:10:38,317 --> 00:10:41,692
Then why don't you tell me
his name and his call sign?

200
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:42,650
Okay.

201
00:10:42,733 --> 00:10:44,983
Urzu 1, Lieutenant Gail McAllen.

202
00:10:45,067 --> 00:10:47,525
In that case,
I think I'll stay put.

203
00:10:47,608 --> 00:10:49,983
I heard that he
was quite a coward.

204
00:10:52,358 --> 00:10:53,025
Okay...

205
00:10:53,108 --> 00:10:53,858
uh...

206
00:10:53,942 --> 00:10:55,025
hang on...

207
00:10:55,108 --> 00:10:57,567
did you just call
my commander a coward?!

208
00:10:57,650 --> 00:10:58,650
Oh wait.

209
00:10:58,733 --> 00:11:00,150
I forgot "incompetent," too.

210
00:11:00,233 --> 00:11:01,900
Whoa.

211
00:11:01,983 --> 00:11:03,442
Sassy bastard.

212
00:11:03,525 --> 00:11:04,900
Hear that, Sousuke?

213
00:11:04,983 --> 00:11:07,900
He says Lieutenant McAllen
was an "incompetent coward."

214
00:11:07,983 --> 00:11:10,108
Well, we don't think so...

215
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,025
Hey, Kurz!

216
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,900
You're pretty
damned soft, sergeant.

217
00:11:21,192 --> 00:11:22,650
'K, asshole...

218
00:11:22,733 --> 00:11:24,567
I'm gonna kick your...!

219
00:11:27,775 --> 00:11:28,400
Kurz!

220
00:11:28,483 --> 00:11:29,275
Leave him be.

221
00:11:29,358 --> 00:11:31,233
He's not gonna croak from it.

222
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:32,608
Well, Goldilocks...

223
00:11:32,692 --> 00:11:34,567
I'm surprised
you tried to stand.

224
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:37,400
You're just as weak
as McAllen was.

225
00:11:37,483 --> 00:11:39,900
Your "Special Response Team"
ain't so special.

226
00:11:39,983 --> 00:11:40,525
What a...

227
00:11:40,608 --> 00:11:41,900
joke.

228
00:11:42,983 --> 00:11:44,567
Got something to add?

229
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,442
Lieutenant, I apologize
for my comrade's rudeness.

230
00:11:47,525 --> 00:11:49,733
But, I'd appreciate it if you
would take back your statements

231
00:11:49,817 --> 00:11:51,900
about Lieutenant McAllen.

232
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:53,525
I don't think so.

233
00:11:54,650 --> 00:11:56,150
What's the matter?

234
00:11:56,233 --> 00:11:59,233
You gonna take a swing at your
superior like this brain donor?

235
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:00,817
I doubt it.

236
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,983
You wanna play
the hard ass, don't you?

237
00:12:03,067 --> 00:12:05,733
But you can't even
wipe your ass without orders.

238
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:08,400
Because you're
just a coward, too.

239
00:12:08,483 --> 00:12:10,983
So you're really
not gonna bite, are you?

240
00:12:11,067 --> 00:12:12,317
Well, Sergeant,

241
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,233
then how about the two of us
play a little game?

242
00:12:14,317 --> 00:12:17,650
You want to defend
McAllen's honor, don't you?

243
00:12:17,733 --> 00:12:21,025
I think the two of us are
gonna have loads of fun.

244
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:22,525
Come with me.

245
00:12:32,567 --> 00:12:33,817
Hnn?

246
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,567
Suppose you're here
to laugh at me, aren't you?

247
00:12:35,650 --> 00:12:37,900
No, I'm delivering
replacement machines.

248
00:12:37,983 --> 00:12:39,067
M types.

249
00:12:40,525 --> 00:12:42,733
Seems to me you've got
something else on your mind...

250
00:12:43,858 --> 00:12:46,567
Actually, there's something
I need to discuss with you.

251
00:12:46,650 --> 00:12:48,442
The Yui sisters.

252
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,567
I have an idea of what
those girls are going to do...

253
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,692
and I'd like you
to stop them, if you can.

254
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,150
Shut up and watch me work.

255
00:12:59,567 --> 00:13:01,275
Understood.

256
00:13:01,358 --> 00:13:04,108
I guess we'll go ahead
and do it your way.

257
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:05,650
Okay...

258
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,067
Looks like daddy's gonna have
to spank you good this time,

259
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:10,150
you naughty little kittens!

260
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:28,900
Yes?

261
00:13:28,983 --> 00:13:30,525
She's here.

262
00:13:30,608 --> 00:13:31,608
You've seen her?

263
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:32,692
Yes.

264
00:13:32,775 --> 00:13:33,858
Now what?

265
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:36,400
We can kill her
any time we want.

266
00:13:36,483 --> 00:13:37,108
Fine.

267
00:13:37,192 --> 00:13:38,942
Just wait for the order.

268
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:40,108
I will.

269
00:13:40,192 --> 00:13:41,942
Is Sensei okay?

270
00:13:42,025 --> 00:13:42,650
Yes.

271
00:13:42,733 --> 00:13:44,650
He still has time left.

272
00:13:44,733 --> 00:13:46,108
For now.

273
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:51,900
Sensei.

274
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:54,067
Let's put an end to this.

275
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:01,317
A game?

276
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:03,525
This is his idea of a game?

277
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,067
That A.S...

278
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,858
it's the one from Sicily!

279
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:22,233
I suppose a proper introduction
is in order now, isn't it?

280
00:14:22,317 --> 00:14:25,400
I come to you fresh from
the Mediterranean Sea Fleet.

281
00:14:25,483 --> 00:14:27,525
Lieutenant Belfangan Clouseau.

282
00:14:27,608 --> 00:14:29,025
And as of today,

283
00:14:29,108 --> 00:14:32,442
I've been assigned to the
West Pacific Ocean Fleet's SRT.

284
00:14:32,525 --> 00:14:35,025
But you can call me "Urzu One."

285
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:38,067
I guess that makes
me the team leader.

286
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,317
But don't hold back.

287
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:41,358
I want you to use that
machine to prove to me

288
00:14:41,442 --> 00:14:43,817
that my predecessor
wasn't incompetent.

289
00:14:45,192 --> 00:14:46,358
GO!

290
00:14:49,233 --> 00:14:50,525
Bastard...

291
00:14:52,317 --> 00:14:54,817
Looks like we're
evenly matched for power.

292
00:15:03,317 --> 00:15:04,442
Not bad.

293
00:15:04,525 --> 00:15:06,942
But your techniques
could use a little work.

294
00:15:09,150 --> 00:15:10,192
What?!

295
00:15:17,858 --> 00:15:19,358
Damn!

296
00:15:19,442 --> 00:15:21,900
Just look at the way
you pilot that thing...

297
00:15:21,983 --> 00:15:23,483
Second rate at best.

298
00:15:23,567 --> 00:15:26,650
You're a skilled fighter,
but you're hardly artistic.

299
00:15:26,733 --> 00:15:29,233
Do you understand
the difference?

300
00:15:29,317 --> 00:15:32,067
Playing pattycake like this
isn't gettin' me anywhere.

301
00:15:32,983 --> 00:15:34,150
Maybe, I just need

302
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:36,150
to try a little harder
to get your attention.

303
00:15:36,233 --> 00:15:37,442
Warning.

304
00:15:37,525 --> 00:15:40,067
Alpha 1 has engaged
its monomolecular cutter.

305
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,233
What is he DOING?

306
00:15:41,317 --> 00:15:42,483
Party time!

307
00:15:43,733 --> 00:15:44,942
Yeah!

308
00:15:56,150 --> 00:15:59,233
That "training method" of his
leaves something to be desired.

309
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,608
I can't say that

310
00:16:00,692 --> 00:16:03,192
I approve of this "Lieutenant
Clouseau's" methods.

311
00:16:03,275 --> 00:16:04,900
I granted him permission.

312
00:16:04,983 --> 00:16:07,900
Otherwise, we may never have
another opportunity to draw out

313
00:16:07,983 --> 00:16:09,608
the Arbalest's true power.

314
00:16:09,692 --> 00:16:11,692
Then that makes it
useless to us.

315
00:16:11,775 --> 00:16:12,900
If he can't rely on

316
00:16:12,983 --> 00:16:15,317
the most substantial
weapon in his arsenal...

317
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:18,483
then he should never be
sent in to battle with it.

318
00:16:18,567 --> 00:16:20,858
Are you saying
it's defective, then?

319
00:16:20,942 --> 00:16:21,942
Yes, ma'am.

320
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,358
I do not like
that machine at all.

321
00:16:24,442 --> 00:16:27,192
I guess Sagara feels the same.

322
00:16:27,275 --> 00:16:28,983
That's part of the problem.

323
00:16:44,608 --> 00:16:45,650
Shit!

324
00:16:45,733 --> 00:16:46,817
Terrible.

325
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:48,358
Really terrible.

326
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:51,400
You're stiff as a brick and
you move like a pregnant duck!

327
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:52,692
On your feet!

328
00:16:52,775 --> 00:16:55,400
Show me what kind of
power that thing has!

329
00:16:55,483 --> 00:16:58,358
Every last bit, you got that?!

330
00:16:58,442 --> 00:17:00,275
No way...

331
00:17:03,692 --> 00:17:05,400
He wants the Lambda Driver?

332
00:17:05,483 --> 00:17:07,108
Let's go, Sergeant!

333
00:17:08,525 --> 00:17:10,192
But it won't ...

334
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:11,483
I can't make it...

335
00:17:28,567 --> 00:17:31,400
Guess you really
are just a lap dog.

336
00:17:33,775 --> 00:17:35,442
Looks like it's over.

337
00:17:35,525 --> 00:17:38,317
It appears the Lambda Driver
failed to activate, Captain.

338
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,067
Yes, I can see that.

339
00:17:42,483 --> 00:17:44,233
What an idiot.

340
00:17:53,858 --> 00:17:57,608
If you were out for revenge
on that guy, chalk up a failure.

341
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:08,942
Neither of you
got in trouble for it.

342
00:18:09,025 --> 00:18:11,858
Looks like the whole thing
was dog and pony show.

343
00:18:11,942 --> 00:18:13,400
That's what you think.

344
00:18:15,692 --> 00:18:17,733
I see you're finally awake.

345
00:18:19,108 --> 00:18:20,400
Sergeant Sagara...

346
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:23,317
Do you understand why
I beat you out there?

347
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:24,858
Our skill difference.

348
00:18:24,942 --> 00:18:26,067
Wrong.

349
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,733
"Skill" doesn't have
a thing to do with it.

350
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:28,983
You've got a problem

351
00:18:29,067 --> 00:18:30,525
that's gonna kill you
unless you deal with it.

352
00:18:30,608 --> 00:18:31,192
Oh really?

353
00:18:31,275 --> 00:18:32,567
What do you know?

354
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:35,150
Well it's obvious to me
that you hate the Arbalest.

355
00:18:36,483 --> 00:18:38,400
I could see it
as soon as we started.

356
00:18:38,483 --> 00:18:40,483
In your footwork,
in your mechanics...

357
00:18:40,567 --> 00:18:42,608
and in every single one
of your attacks...

358
00:18:42,692 --> 00:18:44,900
You were rushing your moves,
full of self-doubt--

359
00:18:44,983 --> 00:18:46,442
every motion...

360
00:18:46,525 --> 00:18:48,483
devoid of heart or conviction.

361
00:18:48,567 --> 00:18:50,650
Never mind about
the Lambda Driver.

362
00:18:50,733 --> 00:18:53,400
This problem goes
back even further.

363
00:18:53,483 --> 00:18:54,567
Lieutenant...

364
00:18:54,650 --> 00:18:57,233
About the attack you
used to defeat me.

365
00:18:57,317 --> 00:19:00,900
What, you think I must've used a
Lambda Driver to bring you down?

366
00:19:00,983 --> 00:19:02,150
Listen, kid...

367
00:19:02,233 --> 00:19:03,858
Not to bust your balls,
but it doesn't take

368
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:06,192
a Lambda Driver to beat you
and the Arbalest.

369
00:19:06,275 --> 00:19:08,067
I employed a special technique.

370
00:19:08,150 --> 00:19:10,942
Using the Japanese
"to-shi" and "sunkei."

371
00:19:11,025 --> 00:19:13,858
M9's can handle that,
depending on the operator

372
00:19:13,942 --> 00:19:16,025
and what they're
trying to accomplish.

373
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:18,442
Sagara...

374
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:20,692
listen: The A.S.
weapon system that we use

375
00:19:20,775 --> 00:19:23,192
is more than
a lifeless machine.

376
00:19:23,275 --> 00:19:24,442
A properly trained soldier

377
00:19:24,525 --> 00:19:27,067
makes it an extension
of his entire body!

378
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:30,567
And your ability to handle it
says a great deal about you.

379
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:31,858
And when the stakes are highest,

380
00:19:31,942 --> 00:19:34,317
your lack of heart'll
get you killed.

381
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:38,317
This is an entirely
new breed of enemy.

382
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,483
And a man who can't even

383
00:19:39,567 --> 00:19:41,942
trust his own body
has no hope of winning.

384
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:43,983
That's all.

385
00:19:44,067 --> 00:19:46,192
Do you plan on
sittin' there all day?

386
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:48,692
Head to the hangar and sign off
on your maintenance, alright?

387
00:19:48,775 --> 00:19:50,150
I'll be looking for your report.

388
00:19:50,233 --> 00:19:52,900
You're gonna get re-trained
starting tomorrow.

389
00:19:52,983 --> 00:19:54,400
You too, Weber.

390
00:19:54,483 --> 00:19:56,108
Yeah, yeah!

391
00:19:57,608 --> 00:19:58,733
Shit!

392
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:01,358
This new lieutenant
is one nasty bastard.

393
00:20:01,442 --> 00:20:03,025
Yeah, but he's strong...

394
00:20:04,733 --> 00:20:06,025
he beat me.

395
00:20:19,233 --> 00:20:20,567
That was you out there,
wasn't it?

396
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:21,275
That's right.

397
00:20:21,358 --> 00:20:23,192
It was me.

398
00:20:23,275 --> 00:20:25,817
Sicily was nice, wasn't it?

399
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:29,567
Not too bad, aside from
all the bloodshed.

400
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,567
Was this his room?

401
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,650
Yeah.

402
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,817
McAllen was the last one
to sleep here...

403
00:20:36,108 --> 00:20:36,858
So...

404
00:20:36,942 --> 00:20:38,358
Did he suffer?

405
00:20:38,442 --> 00:20:40,442
He didn't even see it coming.

406
00:20:40,525 --> 00:20:42,233
I see.

407
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:43,942
I've been thinking
about Sagara...

408
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:44,817
Hmm?

409
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,442
Just like I was at that age...

410
00:20:46,525 --> 00:20:47,983
Always the badass,

411
00:20:48,067 --> 00:20:51,650
blustering his way through shit
with the best of intentions.

412
00:20:51,733 --> 00:20:54,483
But he needs to step back and
see things for what they are,

413
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:56,650
rather than what
he thinks they are.

414
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,025
You think he'll ever do that?

415
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,067
Who knows?

416
00:21:00,150 --> 00:21:03,150
But if he doesn't,
we'll lose him.

417
00:21:03,233 --> 00:21:04,150
He'll be...

418
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:06,233
either a dead man
or a turncoat.

419
00:21:06,317 --> 00:21:07,525
Sousuke?

420
00:21:09,108 --> 00:21:11,733
Where do you think the guys
we're fighting now came from?

421
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:14,233
Malice builds up slowly.

422
00:21:14,317 --> 00:21:15,692
You start lying to yourself.

423
00:21:15,775 --> 00:21:17,358
Then you resent the
people around you and finally

424
00:21:17,442 --> 00:21:19,650
you just switch off
the whole world.

425
00:21:20,692 --> 00:21:22,442
It's a slow process.

426
00:21:22,525 --> 00:21:25,692
Just like you never see the
hour hand on a clock moving...

427
00:21:25,775 --> 00:21:27,233
It sneaks up on you.

428
00:21:29,025 --> 00:21:30,567
That's it for me.

429
00:21:30,650 --> 00:21:32,358
I'm hittin' the sack.

430
00:21:35,483 --> 00:21:36,775
Melissa.

431
00:21:36,858 --> 00:21:38,150
Yeah?

432
00:21:38,233 --> 00:21:41,233
No one needs to know McAllen
and I were war buddies.

433
00:21:41,317 --> 00:21:45,025
I don't want anyone
feelin' sorry for me, okay?

434
00:21:45,108 --> 00:21:46,525
Whatever you say.

435
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:47,900
Pleasant dreams, Ben.

436
00:21:47,983 --> 00:21:49,317
Good night.

437
00:21:52,317 --> 00:21:53,067
Captain.

438
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,442
May I have a word with you?

439
00:21:54,525 --> 00:21:55,692
What is it?

440
00:21:55,775 --> 00:21:58,442
AD Standby order from
Tactical Headquarters.

441
00:21:58,525 --> 00:22:01,025
An AS unit is causing
large-scale destruction,

442
00:22:01,108 --> 00:22:03,400
and local emergency teams
have been mobilized.

443
00:22:03,483 --> 00:22:04,567
Where are they?

444
00:22:04,650 --> 00:22:06,567
It's Hong Kong, Captain.

445
00:23:48,442 --> 00:23:51,192
Left behind in Tokyo, Chidori
has begun a singular battle

446
00:23:51,275 --> 00:23:52,858
with loneliness and doubt.

447
00:23:52,942 --> 00:23:56,025
The gaze of an invisible watcher
causes her fear to grow.

448
00:23:56,108 --> 00:23:58,608
She can no longer trust anyone.

449
00:23:58,692 --> 00:24:00,858
Next time: "Her Problem."

450
00:24:00,942 --> 00:24:04,525
One war ends, like tears
disappearing in the rain...
