avoiding this fight.

Aria. Go find someplace
you'll be safe.

Who are you?

00:02:40.285 --> 00:02:42.037
I've had about enough of this!

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.246
Now show yourselves!

00:02:43.288 --> 00:02:45.749
Three against one
is hardly a fair fight!

She's right about that.

00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:49.961

Don't worry about me.

I've got this covered.

This shouldn't take long.

Just a flesh wound.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:29.543
Please. Let me help
you with this.

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:30.919
No, I can't do that!

00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:33.463
You're too powerful to be
used against humans.

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:35.257
I mean, they should be
punished for attacking us

out of nowhere like that.

00:03:36.591 --> 00:03:39.386
But even they don't deserve
to face a Demon Sword!

Aw, c'mon!

00:03:40.762 --> 00:03:42.931
Less talking, more fighting.

Don't you remember
what you told me before?

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:48.687
You said you wanted to use
my power to protect people.

As your partner, it is
my duty to help you.

[CECILY] I demand to know
why you and your comrades

attacked me.

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.269
[DORIS] We don't give
a crap about you, lady.

00:04:29.311 --> 00:04:31.521
All we want is the Demon
Sword you're holding.

[CECILY]
No way.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:34.941
[DORIS] Why don't you go
ahead and just hand it over.

Forget it!

Oh, yeah?

00:04:37.652 --> 00:04:38.987
Guess I'll have to
take it by force.

00:04:39.029 --> 00:04:40.614
[CECILY]
I wouldn't if I were you!

00:04:46.119 --> 00:04:49.498
If I use this sword,
one of us isn't walking away.

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:51.583
[DORIS] That supposed to
scare me or something?

00:04:51.625 --> 00:04:52.584
Kinda.

Nobody ever says
no to me, you got it?!

Whassamatter, girly?
Why you holding back?

We're both using Demon
Swords, so it's a fair fight!

Fine then.
You leave me no other choice.

She's like Aria!

Awaken and slay God!

Another one. Dammit.

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.345
Evadne is the Demon
Sword of Black Flames.

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:37.017
Not only can I stab you
with her super-sharp blade,

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.935
she has the power
to burn you to death!

00:08:38.977 --> 00:08:40.520
You really should've come
with me when you had

00:08:40.562 --> 00:08:41.980
the chance.

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:43.064
Lisa.

00:08:43.106 --> 00:08:43.982
Right!

You're dead!

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:52.949
Wha--? I don't understand!

00:08:52.991 --> 00:08:55.160
You can't stop her attacks with
a regular sword like yours!

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.786
How'd you do that?

00:08:56.828 --> 00:08:58.413
'Cause I know somethin'
you don't know.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.457
This isn't a regular sword,
it's a katana!

00:09:02.459 --> 00:09:04.335
Stay back! No!

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.430
No, Luke!

00:09:17.057 --> 00:09:18.767
Hey! What do you
think you're doing?

00:09:18.808 --> 00:09:20.727
Threatening the life of the
Emperor's daughter is punishable

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:21.644
by death!

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:23.438
A Demon Sword is not a toy.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.648
It's too dangerous for a child.

00:09:25.690 --> 00:09:27.317
Please! I can't go
back without you

00:09:27.358 --> 00:09:28.777
and the Demon Sword of Wind!

00:09:28.818 --> 00:09:30.361
Please go back to
the Empire with me.

I thought you said you
could handle it, Doris?

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:10.527
Guess I'll have to take
care of this myself.

00:10:10.568 --> 00:10:11.778
[CECILY] And what do you
think you're going to do

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.654
from over there?

00:10:12.695 --> 00:10:15.198
There's no way you can attack
me from that far away.

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:18.284
That's what you think.

00:10:25.250 --> 00:10:27.001

of the Scarlet Ray.

I avoided all your vital organs.

You can thank me later.

Please hand over
the Demon Sword.

You can ask all you want.

00:11:16.301 --> 00:11:18.136
But I'll never give her to you!

00:11:24.517 --> 00:11:25.643
What the hell?

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:26.644
Aria, what happened?

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:27.979
Answer me!

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:31.024
[PENELOPE]
I'm sorry, how rude of me.

00:11:31.065 --> 00:11:33.026
Hello, my name is Penelope.

00:11:33.067 --> 00:11:36.029
And this is my weapon of
choice, the bollock dagger.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:40.033
Otherwise known as the
Demon Sword Assassin.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:42.035
But how is that possible?

00:11:42.076 --> 00:11:43.161
Aria.

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:54.756
Hand it over, or else!

00:11:54.797 --> 00:11:57.258
You're not taking
this sword from me.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.010
I won't let you!

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.729
Careful, Margot!

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.648
You don't wanna get hit!

00:12:11.689 --> 00:12:12.690
No, wait!

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:21.449
[PENELOPE] Just give us
the stupid sword already!

00:12:21.491 --> 00:12:23.243
Aria's my friend.

00:12:23.284 --> 00:12:25.370
I'm gonna protect
her no matter--[grunts]

00:12:26.788 --> 00:12:28.581
Why're you being so stubborn?

00:12:28.623 --> 00:12:31.042
Just give us the sword
and we'll leave you alone.

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:35.672
Never.

00:12:35.713 --> 00:12:37.924
I won't... give her to you.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:41.386
You don't have
much choice, girly.

00:12:43.930 --> 00:12:46.641
[CECILY yelling]

00:12:53.898 --> 00:12:56.651
[DORIS] I'll say this,
you've got some serious guts.

00:12:56.693 --> 00:12:59.737
[MARGOT] We got what we're
after, so we'll keep our word.

00:12:59.779 --> 00:13:01.864
[PENELOPE] Princess Charlotte
is going to be so proud of us!

00:13:01.906 --> 00:13:02.991
[CECILY]
Wait!

00:13:06.035 --> 00:13:07.036
Aria.

00:13:08.538 --> 00:13:10.206
Give her back.

00:13:10.248 --> 00:13:12.250
[DORIS] You don't know
when to give up, do you?

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:13.835
[MARGOT]
It's time to walk away, girl.

00:13:13.876 --> 00:13:15.378
Give her back!

00:13:16.921 --> 00:13:18.214
Man, what a whiner.

00:13:18.256 --> 00:13:19.549
Maybe we should just kill her.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.717
[PENELOPE]
Ooh, I'll do it.

00:13:22.176 --> 00:13:23.678
[thrumming]

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:30.476
What the hell?

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:33.438
[PENELOPE]
Princess Charlotte!

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.233
[LUKE grunts]

00:13:53.958 --> 00:13:57.170
[CECILY]
Luke. It's you.

00:13:57.211 --> 00:14:00.882
You saved me... again.

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.391
Mister Mayor, I'm sorry we
caused so much damage

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.143
in the city today.

00:14:12.185 --> 00:14:13.227
It's fine.

00:14:13.269 --> 00:14:15.146
Do what you must
to keep Aria safe.

00:14:15.188 --> 00:14:17.106
That being said, try to
be a little more careful

00:14:17.148 --> 00:14:18.024
next time.

00:14:18.066 --> 00:14:20.151
[CECILY]
Yes, sir. Thanks, Luke, Lisa.

00:14:20.193 --> 00:14:22.612
If it wasn't for both of you,
I'd be a dead woman.

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:24.280
I'm in your debt.

00:14:24.322 --> 00:14:25.406
You're welcome.

00:14:25.448 --> 00:14:27.784
I hope you're starting to
feel better, Miss Cecily.

00:14:27.825 --> 00:14:30.203
I used a prayer contract to heal
the wound on your shoulder

00:14:30.244 --> 00:14:32.455
so you should be back
to normal in no time.

00:14:32.497 --> 00:14:33.373
[CECILY]
Thank you.

00:14:33.414 --> 00:14:35.750
Now that you mention it,
it does feel a lot better.

00:14:38.836 --> 00:14:40.213
I was wondering, sir.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.714
How do you plan to
punish the three of them

00:14:41.756 --> 00:14:42.799
for attacking us?

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:44.717
[CHARLOTTE]
He won't.

00:14:44.759 --> 00:14:46.761
They're my guards, so if
anyone was to punish them,

00:14:46.803 --> 00:14:48.679
it'd be me.

00:14:48.721 --> 00:14:50.431
I'm sorry, do I know you?

00:14:52.767 --> 00:14:54.602
[CHARLOTTE]
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:14:54.644 --> 00:14:56.771
My name is Charlotte
E. Frobisher.

00:14:56.813 --> 00:14:58.481
[CECILY]
Wha-- "E"?

00:14:58.523 --> 00:14:59.816
That's what I said, isn't it?

00:14:59.857 --> 00:15:02.026
All descendants of the Emperor
have an E in their name.

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:04.320
Hold on.
You're kidding me, right?

00:15:04.362 --> 00:15:05.738
You're really a princess?

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:06.906
[CHARLOTTE]
You heard right.

00:15:06.948 --> 00:15:08.366
I'm here to negotiate.

00:15:08.408 --> 00:15:11.452
I want to make a trade for
the Demon Sword of Wind!

00:15:11.494 --> 00:15:13.996
That and I want the blacksmith
to come work for me.

00:15:14.038 --> 00:15:15.415
They're the reason
I've come to Housman,

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.125
and I won't leave without them!

00:15:17.166 --> 00:15:19.335
You want Luke to work for you?

00:15:19.377 --> 00:15:20.711
She's so demanding.

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:22.213
[HOUSMAN]
As I said, Miss Frobisher.

00:15:22.255 --> 00:15:24.006
I cannot force him to
work for you if--

00:15:24.048 --> 00:15:26.592
Why not? Are you the mayor,
or aren't you?

00:15:26.634 --> 00:15:29.262
Let me put it to you
this way, young lady.

00:15:29.303 --> 00:15:32.390
Luke has said no, therefore I
must decline your request.

00:15:35.601 --> 00:15:36.853
'Kay, fine.

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:38.771
I can do without the blacksmith,

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:42.400
but I refuse to leave the Trade
Cities empty-handed, Mr. Mayor.

00:15:42.442 --> 00:15:45.027
So I will be taking the Demon
Sword of Wind home with me.

00:15:45.069 --> 00:15:45.945
Don't worry!

00:15:45.987 --> 00:15:48.239
I promise I'll pay
a fair price for it!

00:15:48.281 --> 00:15:50.241
I cannot agree to that either.

00:15:50.283 --> 00:15:51.242
Now, that's enough.

00:15:51.284 --> 00:15:53.494
The fate of a Demon Sword
will not be determined

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:55.204
in secret negotiations.

00:15:55.246 --> 00:15:56.873
[CHARLOTTE] I don't see
what the big deal is.

00:15:56.914 --> 00:15:58.749
What's a little business
between friends?

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:01.085
We're not doing anything wrong.

00:16:01.127 --> 00:16:02.503
How can you call yourselves
the Independent

00:16:02.545 --> 00:16:04.714
Trade Cities of Housman if
you're not willing to do any--

00:16:04.755 --> 00:16:07.049
[CECILY]
Oh, would you shut up?

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:08.426
What did you say?

00:16:08.468 --> 00:16:10.511
How dare you speak to
Princess Charlotte that way,

00:16:10.553 --> 00:16:11.554
you lowly commoner!

00:16:11.596 --> 00:16:12.805
Apologize right now!

00:16:12.847 --> 00:16:13.931
That's enough!

00:16:13.973 --> 00:16:15.808
I have had it with your lies!

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:17.226
These women brutally attacked me

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:19.437
to try and get their
hands on Aria, sir!

00:16:19.479 --> 00:16:21.230
They weren't trying
to negotiate a trade--

00:16:21.272 --> 00:16:22.940
they were attempting
to steal her from us!

00:16:22.982 --> 00:16:25.526
And I don't appreciate the way
you're talking about Aria.

00:16:25.568 --> 00:16:27.236
You keep saying you want
to buy her or trade her

00:16:27.278 --> 00:16:29.071
like she's some kind of object!

00:16:29.113 --> 00:16:30.490
Don't you see how rude that is?

00:16:30.531 --> 00:16:32.074
That is a Demon Sword!

00:16:32.116 --> 00:16:33.367
Whether you want
to believe it or not,

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:34.619
it is an object!

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:36.579
I'm sure that's how you
see it, but you're wrong.

00:16:36.621 --> 00:16:39.540
She eats, sleeps and laughs
just like the rest of us.

00:16:39.582 --> 00:16:41.584
But more importantly,
she's my friend.

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:43.419
And you tried to
take her from me!

00:16:43.461 --> 00:16:46.214
Cecily.

00:16:46.255 --> 00:16:47.924
[CECILY] Your lackeys
just followed orders--

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:49.467
you're the one responsible!

00:16:49.509 --> 00:16:51.219
And you deserve to get punished!

00:16:51.260 --> 00:16:53.554
I'm afraid we don't have
that option, Cambell.

00:16:53.596 --> 00:16:57.058
We can't put Princess Charlotte
on trial or even discipline her.

00:16:57.099 --> 00:16:58.976
If we did, we'd run
the risk of destroying

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:00.937
our relationship
with the Empire.

00:17:00.978 --> 00:17:03.105
But sir, if we let her go,
she'll just try again,

00:17:03.147 --> 00:17:04.690
and someone could get hurt!

00:17:04.732 --> 00:17:05.816
Calm down.

00:17:05.858 --> 00:17:07.485
We don't have a
choice in the matter.

00:17:07.527 --> 00:17:09.403
As it stands,
our relations with the Empire

00:17:09.445 --> 00:17:11.239
are shaky at best.

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.491
We can't afford to
jeopardize anything.

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.867
Someday you'll understand.

00:17:14.909 --> 00:17:17.286
Just let it go for now, okay?

00:17:17.328 --> 00:17:19.372
Whatever you say, sir.

00:17:19.413 --> 00:17:20.414
Now then.

00:17:20.456 --> 00:17:23.000
Miss Frobisher, there's
something I'd like to discuss.

00:17:23.042 --> 00:17:25.378
I can't help being a little
suspicious of you.

00:17:25.419 --> 00:17:28.089
Especially given how you
ordered your guards to attack.

00:17:28.130 --> 00:17:29.549
What are you trying to say?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.801
I mean no insult here,
but how can we be sure

00:17:31.842 --> 00:17:33.761
that you are indeed
the Emperor's daughter?

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:34.845
You doubt her?

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.390
I apologize, but I
must be certain.

00:17:37.431 --> 00:17:38.933
I cannot imagine the
Emperor would place

00:17:38.975 --> 00:17:42.228
his own child in danger
to do his bidding.

00:17:42.270 --> 00:17:45.356
So please, do you have any
sort of proof of your lineage?

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.243
What is that?

00:17:57.285 --> 00:17:59.120
It's a special sword that
is given only to those

00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:02.415
who have the royal initial E.

00:18:02.456 --> 00:18:04.458
My mother was a commoner,
but the Emperor

00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.294
took a liking to her.

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:10.006
They fell in love,
and then I came along.

00:18:10.047 --> 00:18:11.799
When the queen found
out about their affair,

00:18:11.841 --> 00:18:14.343
she became insanely jealous.

00:18:14.385 --> 00:18:17.680
So she banished us
from the imperial court.

00:18:17.722 --> 00:18:20.808
If the Emperor would simply
recognize me as his child,

00:18:20.850 --> 00:18:24.061
my mother and I would be
able to return to the Empire.

00:18:24.103 --> 00:18:26.063
We could go home.

00:18:26.105 --> 00:18:27.815
My mother gave me this sword.

00:18:27.857 --> 00:18:31.193
She said it was handed down
to me by the Emperor himself.

00:18:31.235 --> 00:18:35.072
I only hope it's enough to prove
my imperial status to you.

00:18:35.114 --> 00:18:36.699
I am going to hold on to this.

00:18:36.741 --> 00:18:39.493
I'll contact the Emperor
and confirm its authenticity.

00:18:39.535 --> 00:18:42.830
Hopefully, his response
will validate your standing.

00:18:42.872 --> 00:18:44.582
Thank you very much,
Mayor Housman.

00:18:44.624 --> 00:18:45.916
But Princess Charlotte!

00:18:45.958 --> 00:18:48.461
He's been so rude; you don't
have anything to prove to him!

00:18:48.502 --> 00:18:50.129
All I want is for my
mother and I to be able

00:18:50.171 --> 00:18:52.006
to go home again,
and I'll do anything

00:18:52.048 --> 00:18:53.507
to make that happen.

00:18:53.549 --> 00:18:55.259
Even if that means I have
to give up something

00:18:55.301 --> 00:18:56.886
very precious to me.

00:18:56.927 --> 00:18:58.095
Princess.

00:18:58.137 --> 00:18:58.971
[CHARLOTTE]
Don't worry.

00:18:59.013 --> 00:19:01.098
I have faith the Emperor will
finally recognize me

00:19:01.140 --> 00:19:03.643
as his daughter.

00:19:03.684 --> 00:19:05.853
[DORIS] I sure hope
you're right about this.

00:19:08.022 --> 00:19:09.899
Well, since you'll
be staying a while,

00:19:09.940 --> 00:19:12.026
I should reserve you
a room at the local inn.

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.944
One more thing, I'll have
to ask that you ladies

00:19:13.986 --> 00:19:16.405
leave your Demon Swords
with us for the duration.

00:19:16.447 --> 00:19:17.573
[CHARLOTTE]
That's fine.

00:19:17.615 --> 00:19:19.283
I completely understand--
I trust that you'll

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.701
keep them safe.

00:19:20.743 --> 00:19:22.453
But don't worry about the inn.

00:19:22.495 --> 00:19:26.165
If you don't mind I'd prefer to
stay at the lady knight's house!

00:19:26.207 --> 00:19:27.917
Why would you wanna
stay at my house?

00:19:27.958 --> 00:19:29.126
Because you're a knight,
which means

00:19:29.168 --> 00:19:30.836
you're also a noblewoman.

00:19:30.878 --> 00:19:34.590
I figure you must be living
it up in the lap of luxury.

00:19:34.632 --> 00:19:36.342
You're crazy if you think
I'm gonna let you stay

00:19:36.384 --> 00:19:37.885
with me after what you did.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:41.013
Don't worry,
we'll cover your expenses.

00:19:41.055 --> 00:19:42.515
What? But sir!

00:19:48.646 --> 00:19:49.772
[CECILY grunts]

00:19:49.814 --> 00:19:51.607
[CHARLOTTE] Even if her place
is a dump, it's got to be better

00:19:51.649 --> 00:19:52.775
than a cheap inn.

00:19:52.817 --> 00:19:53.859
[MARGOT]
I certainly hope so.

00:19:53.901 --> 00:19:55.820
[DORIS] Whatever, long
as I get my own bed.

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:58.239
[PENELOPE] I can't wait
to take a warm bath!

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.533
If they end up dead,
don't look at me.

00:20:04.412 --> 00:20:07.039
You know, I have a maid
at home who cooks.

00:20:07.081 --> 00:20:08.249
[DORIS]
I can't wait.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:10.835
Thanks to you, I worked
up an appetite earlier.

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.253
Oh, like that was my fault?

00:20:12.294 --> 00:20:13.546
Calm down, lady knight.

00:20:13.587 --> 00:20:15.923
If they hadn't attacked you,
then we wouldn't be friends now.

00:20:15.965 --> 00:20:17.675
We're friends?
Musta missed that part.

00:20:17.717 --> 00:20:19.635
[MARGOT]
Jeez. Just get over it already.

00:20:19.677 --> 00:20:20.970
What do you think, Princess?

00:20:21.011 --> 00:20:22.555
Any idea what you want
to order for dinner?

00:20:22.596 --> 00:20:24.473
There's no need to
make a decision, silly.

00:20:24.515 --> 00:20:25.433
Excuse me.

00:20:25.474 --> 00:20:28.561
I'd like to order one of
everything on your menu, please!

00:20:28.602 --> 00:20:30.980
You can pack it away, too?

00:20:31.021 --> 00:20:33.482
Oh, wait. I don't have enough
on me to cover all that!

00:20:33.524 --> 00:20:35.151
I don't even have pockets!

00:20:35.192 --> 00:20:36.235
Forget about it.

00:20:36.277 --> 00:20:37.695
It looks like we're going
to be staying with you

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:38.779
for a while.

00:20:38.821 --> 00:20:41.240
So the least I can
do is pay for dinner.

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.826
[DORIS]
Whoa! Look at all this!

00:20:43.868 --> 00:20:45.369
It's my lucky day!

00:20:48.956 --> 00:20:50.916
Doris, could you please
mind your manners?

00:20:50.958 --> 00:20:53.919
[MARGOT] Those are manners at a
commoner restaurant like this.

00:20:53.961 --> 00:20:55.463
You're right, I didn't
think about that.

00:20:55.504 --> 00:20:58.716
Yummy! This may be the
best meal I've ever had!

00:20:58.758 --> 00:21:00.050
Oop, got a little somethin'.

00:21:00.092 --> 00:21:01.510
[CHARLOTTE] You don't have
to treat me like a little kid,

00:21:01.552 --> 00:21:02.720
Margot!

00:21:02.762 --> 00:21:03.888
Have seconds!

00:21:03.929 --> 00:21:05.556
You need to eat so
you'll grow up strong.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:07.433
And there's more than
enough here so dig in!

00:21:07.475 --> 00:21:08.601
[DORIS]
There ya go!

00:21:08.642 --> 00:21:10.644
This is the most
magnificent feast ever!

00:21:10.686 --> 00:21:11.645
[DORIS]
Chow down!

00:21:11.687 --> 00:21:14.023
[ALL laugh]

00:21:16.942 --> 00:21:18.444
Thanks, it was divine.

00:21:18.486 --> 00:21:20.362
Uh... Miss, we have
a problem here.

00:21:20.404 --> 00:21:21.697
Did I pay too much?

00:21:21.739 --> 00:21:23.073
Don't worry about it,
my good man.

00:21:23.115 --> 00:21:25.451
You can just keep the
change for yourself, okay?

00:21:25.493 --> 00:21:27.703
Yeah, thanks, but these
three lousy copper coins

00:21:27.745 --> 00:21:29.747
won't even cover the bill.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:31.457
[CHARLOTTE]
Uh, what?!

00:21:31.499 --> 00:21:33.834
Um, okay, we need
a plan. Doris?

00:21:33.876 --> 00:21:36.837
Uh, um... Margot?

00:21:36.879 --> 00:21:39.131
Uh... Penelope?

00:21:39.173 --> 00:21:41.258
Remember how we got lost and
it took us some extra time

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.511
to get here? I guess we must
have spent all our money

00:21:43.552 --> 00:21:45.679
on lodging and travel expenses.

00:21:45.721 --> 00:21:47.223
Yeah, you're right.

00:21:47.264 --> 00:21:49.975
There's only one thing
we can do now!

00:21:50.017 --> 00:21:52.603
Go ahead and put it
on our tab, please!

00:21:52.645 --> 00:21:54.855
On your tab? Okay.

00:21:54.897 --> 00:21:57.107
And who'll be
responsible for this tab?

00:21:57.149 --> 00:21:58.859
The lady knight.
She'll cover it.

00:21:58.901 --> 00:21:59.902
[CECILY gasps]

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:03.697
[CASHIER]
Hm, Cambell House again, right?

00:22:03.739 --> 00:22:06.283
That's one hell of a
bill you've got goin'.

00:22:06.325 --> 00:22:08.744
Excuse me. Could you
add this as well, sir?

00:22:08.786 --> 00:22:11.539
Aw! That's no fair, I want one!

00:22:11.580 --> 00:22:13.040
[DORIS] Well, if you're
getting somethin'.

00:22:13.082 --> 00:22:14.583
[MARGOT] And this would
make a great souvenir!

00:22:14.625 --> 00:22:15.751
[PENELOPE] Oh, wait,
how about one of these?

00:22:15.793 --> 00:22:17.503
[CHARLOTTE]
Just put it all on our tab.

00:22:17.545 --> 00:22:21.632
[CECILY] Princess, you are
one royal pain in the ass!
