Hello, there.

00:00:42.668 --> 00:00:44.086
It's a beautiful day, isn't it?

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:46.838
[laughs]

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.049
So. How are your little
baby birds doing?

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.102
Yay! Another day and
I'm ready to work!

00:02:41.662 --> 00:02:44.206
[OLD WOMAN] Through the power
of this holy Prayer Contract,

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:48.168
I humbly request that this well
be cleansed of all impurities.

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:57.886
Okay. That should do it.

00:02:57.928 --> 00:02:59.304
Thank you for helping me.

00:03:01.348 --> 00:03:03.517
[WOMAN A] I can't believe
you do this every morning.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:05.852
I wish my son could find
a nice girl like you!

00:03:05.894 --> 00:03:07.813
Your son is much
too old for Lisa.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.231
He's in his twenties!

00:03:09.272 --> 00:03:11.149
My son is the
perfect age for her.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:13.068
You'd date my boy, wouldn't you?

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.195
Well, uh, maybe.

00:03:15.237 --> 00:03:17.322
We'll have to have you over
to play with my grandson

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:18.573
again soon.

00:03:18.615 --> 00:03:20.409
He was just telling me about
how much fun the two of you

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.618
have together.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.413
Sure! I would love to
come over and play!

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.791
[LISA]
Good morning, Miss Anna!

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:28.792
[ANNA]
Morning, Lisa!

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.585
I was wondering
when you'd get here.

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.338
Here.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.215
I hope this is enough
to tide you kids over

00:03:35.257 --> 00:03:36.967
for a little while.

00:03:37.008 --> 00:03:38.301
But there's so much!

00:03:38.343 --> 00:03:39.511
Are you sure?

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.887
Of course, my dear.

00:03:40.929 --> 00:03:42.514
You and Luke have
been so good to us,

00:03:42.556 --> 00:03:44.015
it's the least I could do!

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.059
I only wish I had
more to give you.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:47.602
Thanks so much, Miss Anna!

00:03:47.644 --> 00:03:50.147
This should keep us
stocked for a while.

00:03:50.188 --> 00:03:52.983
Well, a growing girl needs
to eat her veggies, right?

00:03:53.024 --> 00:03:54.025
[LISA]
Yes, ma'am!

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.569
[ANNA]
Oh, one more thing.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:57.821
Could I place an order
for two garden hoes?

00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:00.782
I've hired some new farmhands
who'll be starting soon.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:01.825
Yes, ma'am!

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:03.493
I'll tell Luke as soon
as I get home!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:05.954
Oh!

00:04:09.541 --> 00:04:10.959
Oops! Sorry!

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.170
[ANNA chuckles]
That's quite a sight!

00:04:13.211 --> 00:04:14.880
Are you sure you can handle it?

00:04:14.921 --> 00:04:15.964
[LISA]
I got it.

00:04:16.006 --> 00:04:17.591
It's just a little heavy.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:30.479
Hey! How you doing, Lisa?

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.606
Oh, I'm fine, thanks for asking.

00:04:32.647 --> 00:04:35.358
You're up awfully early
this morning, aren't you?

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.445
So, how's it going?
Did you have a good harvest?

00:04:38.487 --> 00:04:41.364
Yeah, we've got tons of radishes
and some other good stuff.

00:04:41.406 --> 00:04:43.784
Here y'go.
Let me give you a couple.

00:04:43.825 --> 00:04:45.243
[LISA grunts]

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.621
[MAN B laughs] Be careful on
your way home, okay?

00:04:47.662 --> 00:04:49.748
[LISA]
Yes, sir! Thank you!

00:05:17.943 --> 00:05:20.153
Okay! Time to get back to work!

00:05:35.293 --> 00:05:36.628
Now that smells yummy.

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.171
[stomach growls]

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:42.884
Rise and shine, Luke!

00:05:42.926 --> 00:05:44.553
Your breakfast is ready!

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.304
I made your favorite!

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:51.518
C'mon, Luke!

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:53.645
It's wake-up time--
breakfast is waiting!

00:05:53.687 --> 00:05:55.564
If you don't hurry,
it'll get cold!

00:05:57.315 --> 00:05:58.900
[rustling]

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.864
[LISA]
Good morning, sleepyhead.

00:06:05.198 --> 00:06:07.576
[LUKE yawns]

00:06:22.632 --> 00:06:25.844
So are there any new jobs
we need to start on today?

00:06:25.886 --> 00:06:28.305
Uh-huh! Miss Anna told me
she needs two more hoes

00:06:28.346 --> 00:06:29.931
for her new farmhands.

00:06:29.973 --> 00:06:33.310
Well, I'm pretty sure that we
already have two in stock.

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:36.187
Okay.
I'll deliver them tomorrow.

00:06:36.229 --> 00:06:37.564
Guess if we don't
have any orders,

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:38.982
I can make something new.

00:06:39.024 --> 00:06:40.150
I have an idea!

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:42.569
Why don't you start forging
Miss Cecily's katana?

00:06:42.611 --> 00:06:44.821
No way, not in a million years.

00:06:44.863 --> 00:06:47.365
But why not?
She deserves one.

00:06:47.407 --> 00:06:50.869
Lisa. When did you start siding
with that loser knight?

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:53.204
Since the beginning.

00:06:53.246 --> 00:06:56.458
Aw, c'mon, you know
she's not a loser!

00:06:56.499 --> 00:06:59.252
She's a beautiful lady
who's kind and generous.

00:06:59.294 --> 00:07:01.880
Who just happens to have
ginormous knockers!

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.381
[LUKE coughs]

00:07:05.425 --> 00:07:06.593
Enough about that.

00:07:06.635 --> 00:07:07.886
Let's get to work.

00:07:07.928 --> 00:07:09.304
You got it, Luke!

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.105
[LISA grunts]

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:31.493
[LUKE]
Lisa! Don't lose focus!

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.286
[LISA]
Right! I'm sorry.

00:07:43.713 --> 00:07:45.966
Whaddaya say we break for lunch?

00:07:46.007 --> 00:07:47.217
Yeah!

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:55.850
Crap.

00:07:55.892 --> 00:07:57.978
Hm! What's the matter, Luke?

00:07:58.019 --> 00:07:59.729
If you've got something to say,
you should just go ahead

00:07:59.771 --> 00:08:00.689
and say it.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.649
--Go home.
--You're so rude!

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.653
[LUKE] Shouldn't you be off
looking for the man in black

00:08:06.695 --> 00:08:07.696
or something?

00:08:07.737 --> 00:08:08.905
[CECILY]
I have the day off.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.658
Besides, I haven't been over to
pester you for a sword lately.

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:15.996
Yeah, like I told you before,
no money, no katana.

00:08:16.037 --> 00:08:18.081
I know, but still!

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.749
You could start one for me.

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:20.959
Not gonna happen.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.211
It's not even about
the money at this point.

00:08:23.253 --> 00:08:25.422
What do you know about katana?

00:08:25.463 --> 00:08:28.842
Have you bothered doing
any research on them?

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:31.052
You know, he's got a point.

00:08:31.094 --> 00:08:33.555
Yeah, yeah.
I know he does.

00:08:33.596 --> 00:08:36.182
I realize I'm not an
expert on the subject.

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.892
But I wanna learn more.

00:08:37.934 --> 00:08:39.561
It'd be nice if
someone'd teach me.

00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:44.232
Yeah, real good luck with that.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.608
[CECILY]
I was going to ask you.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:47.736
Better not be what I think
you're about to ask.

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:52.365
No!
What I was gonna-- I mean...

00:08:54.284 --> 00:08:56.119
I wanna know about
Demon Contracts!

00:08:58.288 --> 00:09:00.331
I'm sure you're familiar
with the basics.

00:09:01.916 --> 00:09:06.087
Unlike a Prayer Contract, which
uses tamahagane as a catalyst,

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:09.591
a Demon Contract
uses the human soul.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.801
When a Demon Contract
is completed,

00:09:11.843 --> 00:09:14.012
that person is turned into
a demon in exchange

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.931
for obtaining
something they desire.

00:09:16.973 --> 00:09:19.517
In the Valbanill War
44 years ago,

00:09:19.559 --> 00:09:23.396
those who signed Demon Contracts
were used as weapons.

00:09:23.438 --> 00:09:25.940
[ARIA] I saw it myself;
it was horrific.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:27.859
[LUKE] Once the soul's been
offered, there's no way

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.527
to ever get it back.

00:09:29.569 --> 00:09:31.362
It's all part of the sacrifice.

00:09:35.658 --> 00:09:39.245
That war had more casualties
than any before it.

00:09:39.287 --> 00:09:41.414
In order to win,
Valbanill was determined

00:09:41.456 --> 00:09:44.417
to turn every human
he found into a demon.

00:09:44.459 --> 00:09:45.251
I don't get it.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:47.670
Valbanill gave them what
they wanted, right?

00:09:47.712 --> 00:09:49.589
So what did he get out of
the deal besides an army

00:09:49.631 --> 00:09:51.257
of demons?

00:09:51.299 --> 00:09:52.759
Their death songs.

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:54.511
[CECILY]
What's that?

00:09:54.552 --> 00:09:56.471
[LUKE]
You can find it right there.

00:09:59.974 --> 00:10:02.727
[CECILY gasps]
Jeez, you're a pervert!

00:10:02.769 --> 00:10:05.355
[LUKE] No wait!
Dammit, you've got it all wrong!

00:10:05.396 --> 00:10:08.650
I'm trying to say the song's
written inside of you.

00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:09.943
What does that mean?

00:10:09.984 --> 00:10:12.362
It's on your heart.

00:10:12.403 --> 00:10:15.990
Every person has a death song
engraved upon their heart.

00:10:16.032 --> 00:10:18.034
Each one is different,
unique to the person.

00:10:18.076 --> 00:10:19.953
What? Seriously?

00:10:19.994 --> 00:10:22.163
Your death song must be
read if you want to sign

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:24.124
a Demon Contract.

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:26.000
They read their death song?

00:10:26.042 --> 00:10:28.628
But how is that even possible?

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:31.840
Actually, there are several
ways it can be accomplished.

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:35.135
Usually, the person is drugged
with a Prayer Contract.

00:10:35.176 --> 00:10:37.637
Once they're unconscious,
their chest is sliced open

00:10:37.679 --> 00:10:39.430
and the song is written down.

00:10:39.472 --> 00:10:41.307
Sometimes the person
is forced to read their own

00:10:41.349 --> 00:10:44.018
death song using a mirror.

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.646
It's the ultimate sacrifice
a human being can make.

00:10:48.022 --> 00:10:50.441
That sounds completely inhumane!

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.736
[LUKE] That's why the practice
has been banned since the war.

00:10:53.778 --> 00:10:55.697
I guess so.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:58.032
But obviously it's still going
on since we've had all these

00:10:58.074 --> 00:11:00.743
demon attacks recently.

00:11:00.785 --> 00:11:02.745
If only we could track down
the man who seems to be

00:11:02.787 --> 00:11:04.747
responsible for everything.

00:11:04.789 --> 00:11:07.500
You mean the man
in black, right?

00:11:07.542 --> 00:11:08.668
[CECILY]
Yeah.

00:11:08.710 --> 00:11:11.087
Just promise me you'll kill him.

00:11:11.129 --> 00:11:13.840
Him and everyone else
involved in Demon Contracts.

00:11:17.635 --> 00:11:20.263
Uh, okay.

00:11:21.181 --> 00:11:22.807
So! Let's eat!

00:11:22.849 --> 00:11:24.726
Looks delicious, doesn't it?

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:28.271
I'm so hungry, you're about to
see me eat my weight in pasta!

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:30.523
Hey! You better
leave some for us!

00:11:30.565 --> 00:11:31.608
This looks great!

00:11:31.649 --> 00:11:33.151
Thanks for inviting us, Lisa!

00:11:43.661 --> 00:11:46.039
Do you want some help with that?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:48.166
[ARIA] You have to do
laundry every day?

00:11:48.208 --> 00:11:49.792
That doesn't sound
like much fun.

00:11:49.834 --> 00:11:50.627
It's fine.

00:11:50.668 --> 00:11:52.670
As long as I'm helping Luke,
I really don't mind.

00:11:52.712 --> 00:11:54.214
It's not all that bad.

00:11:58.051 --> 00:12:01.512
[CECILY] Hey, Lisa.
Mind if I ask you something?

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:02.513
Yeah?

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:03.973
I was just wondering.

00:12:04.015 --> 00:12:08.186
Do you have any other clothes,
or is that your only outfit?

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.729
Well, sort of.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:12.148
I do have two other
sets just like this.

00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:13.358
That counts, right?

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:14.859
[CECILY]
Afraid not. No.

00:12:14.901 --> 00:12:16.486
You need some new clothes.

00:12:18.321 --> 00:12:19.697
[LUKE] Lisa!
Let's get back to work!

00:12:19.739 --> 00:12:21.741
'Kay! Be right there!

00:12:23.826 --> 00:12:25.536
Thanks for coming
over for lunch.

00:12:36.714 --> 00:12:37.799
Hey, Fio.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.883
[FIO]
Yes, Miss?

00:12:38.925 --> 00:12:41.302
[CECILY] I know this is a weird
question, but do you like

00:12:41.344 --> 00:12:43.846
working here?
Or is it a pain sometimes?

00:12:43.888 --> 00:12:46.641
Well, do you think I'd
stick around if I hated it?

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:47.558
No.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.644
I like working at
the Cambell House.

00:12:49.686 --> 00:12:52.313
You and your mother
are great employers.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:53.523
I'm glad.

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:57.610
This is the best tea ever!

00:12:57.652 --> 00:12:59.445
Well of course it is!

00:12:59.487 --> 00:13:01.739
I put a lot of
love into that tea!

00:13:01.781 --> 00:13:03.324
It is my job!

00:13:03.366 --> 00:13:07.954
So, Fio? Can I get your
opinion on something?

00:13:07.996 --> 00:13:09.455
Yeah, sure.

00:13:19.382 --> 00:13:21.592
Here ya go, Miss.
Have one on the house.

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:25.096
Thank you so much, sir!

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:27.473
Here! I have two more
for you ladies.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:29.600
[ARIA] Thank you, sir!
You're so sweet!

00:13:29.642 --> 00:13:30.810
Why me?

00:13:39.027 --> 00:13:40.653
Oh, yum!

00:13:40.695 --> 00:13:43.197
Lisa, you've got to try it!

00:13:43.239 --> 00:13:44.324
If you say so.

00:13:46.159 --> 00:13:47.493
Delicious!

00:13:47.535 --> 00:13:49.454
[ARIA] I know! Isn't it the
greatest thing ever?

00:13:49.495 --> 00:13:51.372
[LISA]
I can't get enough!

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:53.333
[LUKE] Yeah, so, why'd
I have to come with you?

00:13:53.374 --> 00:13:55.251
This is supposed
to be my day off.

00:13:55.293 --> 00:13:57.170
I thought it would be nice
for you to spend some time

00:13:57.211 --> 00:13:58.379
with Lisa.

00:13:58.421 --> 00:13:59.547
You know, Luke...

00:14:00.882 --> 00:14:03.134
I don't think you're providing
her with a satisfactory

00:14:03.176 --> 00:14:04.552
lifestyle.

00:14:04.594 --> 00:14:08.056
I remember you telling me
how special she is to you--

00:14:09.098 --> 00:14:11.142
Hold on, I just realized.

00:14:11.184 --> 00:14:12.643
You're such a perv!

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:14.312
How could you be into that?

00:14:14.354 --> 00:14:15.521
That's not true and you know it.

00:14:15.563 --> 00:14:16.814
You're just trying to come
up with new reasons

00:14:16.856 --> 00:14:18.191
to hate me!

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.650
Like I need new ones!

00:14:23.196 --> 00:14:26.032
[CECILY] You guys aren't
related, are you?

00:14:26.074 --> 00:14:28.076
Um, no.

00:14:28.117 --> 00:14:30.036
I found her.

00:14:30.078 --> 00:14:31.788
You found her?

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:33.664
I don't want to talk about it.

00:14:33.706 --> 00:14:35.666
I'm sorry, I didn't mean--

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:37.001
Wait a sec!

00:14:37.043 --> 00:14:39.087
You're not getting off
that easy, you big jerk!

00:14:39.128 --> 00:14:40.713
Wh-What did I do?

00:14:40.755 --> 00:14:42.507
You've been treating Lisa
like she's some kind of

00:14:42.548 --> 00:14:44.008
second-class citizen!

00:14:44.050 --> 00:14:45.176
What?

00:14:45.218 --> 00:14:48.262
She's a growing girl at a
very impressionable age.

00:14:48.304 --> 00:14:50.681
All she ever wears is
dirty old work clothes.

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.892
She deserves to
have nice things,

00:14:52.934 --> 00:14:54.769
but she doesn't have time
to shop 'cause she's busy

00:14:54.811 --> 00:14:56.270
doing all your chores.

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:58.314
[LUKE] Never thought
about it like that.

00:14:58.356 --> 00:15:00.274
You need to take her
out once in a while.

00:15:00.316 --> 00:15:02.693
You know. Buy her stuff,
go out to eat.

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:04.529
I don't care what it is
as long as you start

00:15:04.570 --> 00:15:06.656
showing her you care!

00:15:06.697 --> 00:15:08.324
If you don't treat her better,
you'll run the risk

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:09.450
of losing her!

00:15:09.492 --> 00:15:11.119
And what makes you
the expert, huh?

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:12.870
I'm a girl!

00:15:14.372 --> 00:15:17.291
[ARIA] Cecily!
You have to come try this!

00:15:17.333 --> 00:15:18.501
Be right there!

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.131
[CECILY] Wow! Hope it tastes
as good as it looks!

00:15:23.172 --> 00:15:25.007
Yeah, here.
I got one for you too!

00:15:25.049 --> 00:15:26.175
[CECILY]
Thank you, Lisa!

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.386
--[LISA] They're so good!
--[ARIA] You're gonna love it!

00:15:28.428 --> 00:15:30.054
Crap, maybe she's right.

00:15:30.805 --> 00:15:32.890
[ARIA] Ooh!
Let's go to that shop next!

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:43.067
Do you want to try it on?

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.610
Uh, no thanks!

00:15:44.652 --> 00:15:45.862
But it's so pretty!

00:15:45.903 --> 00:15:47.613
Yeah, but I don't need a dress.

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.907
Hold on.
Are we shopping for Lisa?

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:51.784
This is going to be so much fun!

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:54.078
--Uh, I don't know.
--[CECILY] Aw, c'mon.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.205
Um, is it okay?

00:15:56.247 --> 00:15:57.707
I don't want you
to have to wait.

00:15:57.748 --> 00:15:59.667
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.169
Right? Won't you?

00:16:02.712 --> 00:16:05.673
I'll pay for whatever you want,
long as you make it quick.

00:16:05.715 --> 00:16:07.383
I don't wanna be here all day.

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:10.178
[LISA]
Oh, wow!

00:16:10.219 --> 00:16:12.138
Everything's so beautiful!

00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:14.724
You heard what Luke said,
anything you want.

00:16:14.765 --> 00:16:16.142
But there's so much here!

00:16:16.184 --> 00:16:19.061
All of these options
are making me dizzy!

00:16:19.103 --> 00:16:21.272
Don't worry, we'll help
you pick some stuff.

00:16:21.314 --> 00:16:23.191
Lisa? What's your size?

00:16:23.232 --> 00:16:25.610
Uh... I don't know,
I've never been measured.

00:16:25.651 --> 00:16:27.445
[ARIA]
Oh, we'll fix that!

00:16:27.487 --> 00:16:28.488
Thanks, ma'am.

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:29.780
[SEAMSTRESS]
No problem.

00:16:32.033 --> 00:16:33.826
[LISA giggling]

00:16:33.868 --> 00:16:36.787
I'm sorry.
I promise I'll make it quick.

00:16:36.829 --> 00:16:38.039
Thank you.

00:16:41.334 --> 00:16:43.461
She's finished measuring!

00:16:43.503 --> 00:16:44.587
You ready?

00:16:44.629 --> 00:16:46.380
We picked out a bunch!

00:16:46.422 --> 00:16:48.049
How 'bout this?

00:16:50.301 --> 00:16:51.385
Okay!

00:16:57.934 --> 00:17:00.061
[LISA]
It's so pretty.

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:01.145
I'm ready!

00:17:06.484 --> 00:17:07.610
How beautiful!

00:17:07.652 --> 00:17:09.320
All right, let's try
the next one!

00:17:22.250 --> 00:17:25.795
Cecily! I found something I
think you'd look real sexy in!

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:27.463
[CECILY gasps]
Aria!

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:29.674
[ARIA] You oughta wear
clothes that accentuate your,

00:17:29.715 --> 00:17:31.133
um, features.

00:17:31.175 --> 00:17:33.094
[CECILY] What is with
you guys and my chest?

00:17:33.135 --> 00:17:35.304
Lisa! Why don't you
try this one next?

00:17:35.346 --> 00:17:36.347
[LISA]
Okay!

00:17:45.773 --> 00:17:48.693
[LISA]
I'm not too sure about this.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:50.403
What do you mean?

00:17:50.444 --> 00:17:53.030
[LISA] I feel bad making Luke
pay for my new clothes.

00:17:53.072 --> 00:17:55.575
Well he shoulda done this
for you a long time ago.

00:17:55.616 --> 00:17:57.702
As far as I'm concerned,
his assistant--

00:17:57.743 --> 00:18:01.289
[LISA]
But I'm happy.

00:18:01.330 --> 00:18:04.500
Just working alongside him
at the shop every day.

00:18:04.542 --> 00:18:07.753
He doesn't have to buy me
things to make me happy.

00:18:07.795 --> 00:18:09.714
[CECILY]
You work so hard for him.

00:18:09.755 --> 00:18:11.382
Let him do this for you.

00:18:11.424 --> 00:18:14.927
He's such a cheap bastard
I'm surprised he even offered!

00:18:14.969 --> 00:18:17.138
[LISA]
Well I still feel guilty.

00:18:17.179 --> 00:18:19.849
[CECILY] I think this is Luke's
way of telling you he cares.

00:18:21.851 --> 00:18:23.436
He may be a
brilliant blacksmith,

00:18:23.477 --> 00:18:25.688
but he's kind of a clueless man.

00:18:25.730 --> 00:18:27.523
He wanted to do
something nice for you,

00:18:27.565 --> 00:18:29.191
but he didn't know how.

00:18:29.233 --> 00:18:31.736
So don't feel guilty--
he wants to do this.

00:18:31.777 --> 00:18:34.405
Um, you sure?

00:18:34.447 --> 00:18:36.365
You really think he
cares about me?

00:18:38.367 --> 00:18:39.619
Of course I do.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:41.370
He's just not very
good at showing it.

00:18:43.247 --> 00:18:44.707
[LISA]
I hope that's true.

00:18:46.167 --> 00:18:47.126
[LISA]
Luke.

00:18:50.129 --> 00:18:52.840
[LISA]
I'm sorry you had to wait.

00:18:52.882 --> 00:18:55.092
So, uh, this is
the outfit I chose.

00:18:55.134 --> 00:18:56.510
Pretty cute, huh?

00:18:58.679 --> 00:19:01.307
I just wanted to say thank
you for buying it for me!

00:19:02.016 --> 00:19:05.186
You got what you
wanted? Let's go.

00:19:05.227 --> 00:19:08.189
Um, where are Miss
Cecily and Miss Aria?

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.441
I guess they're still in there.

00:19:10.483 --> 00:19:11.776
I don't understand,
they should've come out

00:19:11.817 --> 00:19:13.444
at the same time I did.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:16.280
Maybe they left you to
go stuff their faces again.

00:19:16.322 --> 00:19:17.448
Now come on.

00:19:19.408 --> 00:19:21.243
[LISA]
Luke, wait for me!

00:19:21.285 --> 00:19:23.537
Why's he have to be
such a jerk all the time?

00:19:23.579 --> 00:19:24.872
I hate him.

00:19:24.914 --> 00:19:27.041
Yeah, but can you explain
to me why we're hiding

00:19:27.083 --> 00:19:28.501
from them?

00:19:28.542 --> 00:19:30.544
Don't you remember
what Fio said?

00:19:30.586 --> 00:19:32.421
They need their quality time.

00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:34.882
It's the only way their
relationship will get stronger.

00:19:34.924 --> 00:19:36.467
You sure that'll work?

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:38.260
He doesn't talk to her much.

00:19:38.302 --> 00:19:40.888
Oh, it'll work.
I'll make sure of it.

00:19:40.930 --> 00:19:42.306
[LISA]
Hey, check it out, Luke!

00:19:42.348 --> 00:19:43.641
It's a pineapple!

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.643
I've never had one
of these before!

00:19:45.685 --> 00:19:47.061
Maybe we should buy
one just to see

00:19:47.103 --> 00:19:47.937
what it tastes like!

00:19:47.978 --> 00:19:49.980
[LUKE]
We don't need it. Keep movin'.

00:19:55.403 --> 00:19:56.904
Did you see how rude he was?

00:19:56.946 --> 00:20:00.324
I can't believe he'd walk
away from her like that!

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.868
Oh, he is gonna pay!

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:04.412
[ARIA]
Calm down, Cecily!

00:20:04.453 --> 00:20:06.497
You said we're not supposed
to get involved, remember?

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.541
[CECILY] That was before
he pissed me off!

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.292
Wait! Where did they go?

00:20:10.334 --> 00:20:11.377
Huh?

00:20:11.419 --> 00:20:13.129
Damn it! We lost 'em!

00:20:21.387 --> 00:20:22.972
Luke. Thank you.

00:20:23.013 --> 00:20:26.142
I really appreciate the
outfit you bought me.

00:20:26.183 --> 00:20:28.144
You didn't have to do that.

00:20:28.185 --> 00:20:29.061
[LUKE]
Sure.

00:20:29.103 --> 00:20:32.773
Uh, I know you hate the market.
So thanks.

00:20:32.815 --> 00:20:35.484
I had a lot of fun
shopping today.

00:20:35.526 --> 00:20:38.612
Being around all those people
must've worn you out, huh?

00:20:38.654 --> 00:20:39.864
[LUKE]
Yeah, a little.

00:20:43.659 --> 00:20:45.870
So what do you want me
to make for dinner tonight?

00:20:45.911 --> 00:20:47.329
I don't care.

00:20:47.371 --> 00:20:48.664
Okay.

00:20:48.706 --> 00:20:50.958
Today was great, wasn't it?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:51.876
I guess.

00:20:51.917 --> 00:20:55.171
I only hope tomorrow
will be just as great!

00:20:55.212 --> 00:20:56.547
Uh-huh.

00:21:11.437 --> 00:21:13.147
Luke?

00:21:13.189 --> 00:21:15.065
Does this outfit
look good on me?

00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.018
[LUKE]
I got bored waiting.

00:21:51.060 --> 00:21:53.479
So I picked that up.

00:21:53.521 --> 00:21:55.272
I'm glad it matches
your new outfit.

00:22:02.154 --> 00:22:03.697
Thank you, Luke.

00:22:04.740 --> 00:22:05.866
Thank you.

00:22:08.077 --> 00:22:09.161
[LUKE]
Let's go home.

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:10.371
Okay!
