WEBVTT

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.804
[LISA OAKWOOD] You just watch!
Someday, I'll be a knight!

00:00:12.846 --> 00:00:13.889
[LUKE]
You're kidding, right?

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:15.432
Old man Hannibal
would die of laughter

00:00:15.474 --> 00:00:16.934
if he heard you say that.

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:20.103
[LISA OAKWOOD] I'm not kidding,
Luke. I'm serious!

00:00:20.145 --> 00:00:21.146
For real!

00:00:21.188 --> 00:00:24.525
I'm gonna work hard to protect
this city and everyone in it!

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.735
I wanna keep all
the citizens safe.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.571
So they can live happy lives
without any worries.

00:00:29.613 --> 00:00:31.698
You can do it, Lisa.
I believe in you!

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.493
Then can you do me a favor?

00:00:34.535 --> 00:00:36.787
I want you to forge
a katana for me.

00:00:36.828 --> 00:00:38.539
[LUKE]
But I'm just an apprentice.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.332
[LISA OAKWOOD]
I know that, silly.

00:00:40.374 --> 00:00:42.584
But someday, you'll be
a famous blacksmith,

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.294
and I'll be a valiant knight.

00:00:44.336 --> 00:00:46.421
Then we'll be able
to protect the city together.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:48.340
[giggles]
How does that sound?

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.677
[LUKE] Sounds awesome!
I'm all for it!

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:52.719
Pinky swear?

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.346
[LUKE]
Pinky swear.

00:00:55.973 --> 00:00:57.266
[LUKE gasps]

00:01:00.352 --> 00:01:01.770
[splortch]

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:03.021
Ah!

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:06.149
[panting]

00:01:06.191 --> 00:01:07.484
[knocking]

00:01:07.526 --> 00:01:09.903
[LISA]
Luke! It's time to get up!

00:01:11.863 --> 00:01:14.700
[LISA] If you don't hurry, your
breakfast is gonna get cold!

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:20.872
[LUKE] I can't believe
it's been three years.

00:02:58.011 --> 00:02:59.930
[LUCY]
You have today off, don't you?

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.264
[CECILY]
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:03.850
I thought I might do
a little bit of training.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.061
I really need to build up
the muscles in my arms,

00:03:06.103 --> 00:03:08.355
they're sorta wimpy right now.

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:11.108
[LUCY sighs]
What'll I do with you?

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.109
Huh?

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.528
Most girls your age like to go
shopping on their day off,

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:16.530
not spend the day
working on their muscles.

00:03:16.571 --> 00:03:17.781
I'm not "most girls"!

00:03:17.823 --> 00:03:20.909
Why can't you try to be
a little more ladylike?

00:03:20.951 --> 00:03:23.328
I mean, is that really too much
for me to ask of you?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.329
[CECILY gasps]

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.747
And why don't you
have a boyfriend?

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.458
There has to be a man out there
somewhere you find attractive.

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:29.876
Ah!

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:35.924
Uh, no!

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:38.176
I haven't found anyone
like that, Mom!

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:41.012
Ah. So there is someone!

00:03:41.054 --> 00:03:42.264
I was beginning to worry.

00:03:42.305 --> 00:03:43.974
Well? Tell me all about him!

00:03:44.015 --> 00:03:46.184
Well. He's kinda
socially awkward.

00:03:46.226 --> 00:03:48.103
But he's a nice guy--
really handsome.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.104
Aria!

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:50.689
You're going to need some help.

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.817
Oh, Fio? Would you please
take Cecily to my closet?

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.152
Yes, ma'am.

00:03:55.193 --> 00:03:56.445
Why?

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.488
Well, you can't go
see him like that.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:00.282
I'll let you borrow
a nice dress.

00:04:00.323 --> 00:04:01.783
Then you can
ask him out on a date.

00:04:01.825 --> 00:04:04.286
Wha--? Wah!

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:07.122
Hey! Let go of me, Fio!
Come on, please?

00:04:07.164 --> 00:04:10.584
Would you help her
pick out an outfit, Aria?

00:04:10.625 --> 00:04:13.086
Don't mind if I do!

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:15.005
[CECILY]
Aria! You traitor!

00:04:15.046 --> 00:04:18.842
Let me go, Fio! Seriously!
I don't wanna ask him out!

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:20.385
Someone, help!

00:04:24.723 --> 00:04:26.475
Can't remember
what kind she likes.

00:04:26.516 --> 00:04:27.976
You're such a boy.

00:04:28.018 --> 00:04:30.270
I have no idea
which ones to pick.

00:04:30.312 --> 00:04:33.064
How could you not know
what kind of flowers she likes?

00:04:33.106 --> 00:04:36.318
Well, I'm not sure
I ever even asked her.

00:04:36.359 --> 00:04:38.153
This isn't good.

00:04:40.155 --> 00:04:44.451
[sighs] Well, I don't know about
her, but I like the white ones.

00:04:44.493 --> 00:04:48.163
Like these over here.
See how pretty they are?

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:52.167
Or maybe... Something
with a little more color?

00:04:54.544 --> 00:04:57.130
[CECILY grunting]

00:05:03.094 --> 00:05:05.597
I can't let anyone
see me like this!

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:07.182
[whines]

00:05:07.224 --> 00:05:09.017
This was all a big
misunderstanding,

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:11.770
and now I'm stuck
in this stupid dress!

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:15.148
Now, Cecily. I know you're
modest, but remember this:

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.526
You must show off your bust!

00:05:17.567 --> 00:05:20.320
I want you to ask this young man
to go on a date with you.

00:05:20.362 --> 00:05:22.989
I'll be very upset
if you return empty handed.

00:05:23.031 --> 00:05:25.325
I'm gonna stay here,
so you just take your time.

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:26.785
In fact, if you want...

00:05:26.827 --> 00:05:30.038
...come back in the morning.
You get me?

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.998
Can't they see how
ridiculous this is?!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.041
I'm not interested in him!

00:05:33.083 --> 00:05:35.293
Even if I was,
he doesn't like me like that.

00:05:35.335 --> 00:05:38.255
So why do I have
to ask him out?!

00:05:38.296 --> 00:05:40.215
Ah. Oh, wait.

00:05:40.257 --> 00:05:43.009
If he saw me like this,
he might notice...

00:05:43.051 --> 00:05:47.013
[gasps] What the hell
am I talking about?

00:05:47.055 --> 00:05:48.765
[sighs]

00:05:48.807 --> 00:05:51.852
Screw this, I'm going home...

00:05:51.893 --> 00:05:53.520
[BLACKSMITH]
Cecily?

00:05:53.562 --> 00:05:56.815
Almost didn't recognize you.
You look really nice.

00:05:56.857 --> 00:05:58.567
Y'oughtta dress
like that more often.

00:05:58.608 --> 00:06:01.361
[whimpers]
Yeah!

00:06:01.403 --> 00:06:03.530
Well, I hate to bother you,
butcha think you can

00:06:03.572 --> 00:06:04.865
do me a favor?

00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:06.324
[CECILY]
Uh?

00:06:06.366 --> 00:06:09.077
[BLACKSMITH] This young lady
has a dagger she'd like fixed.

00:06:09.119 --> 00:06:12.455
Would you mind taking her
over to Luke's place for me?

00:06:12.497 --> 00:06:14.082
Um, Luke's place?

00:06:14.124 --> 00:06:15.458
Got somewhere else
you need to be?

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.836
Well, no, sir.
That's not the problem.

00:06:17.878 --> 00:06:19.421
I'd really appreciate it.

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:22.257
It's nice to meet you.
My name is Elsa.

00:06:22.299 --> 00:06:23.884
Uh, hi.

00:06:26.678 --> 00:06:29.598
[CECILY whimpering]

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.728
First a maid's outfit,
and now this get up?

00:06:34.769 --> 00:06:36.980
Yeah? You got a problem with it?

00:06:37.022 --> 00:06:38.607
[LUKE]
I think it's a little weird.

00:06:38.648 --> 00:06:41.192
No, you just don't
see me as a woman!

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.944
Maybe I would
if you'd act like one.

00:06:42.986 --> 00:06:45.488
[CECILY]
Ah. I'm trying...

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:47.198
Try harder.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:50.785
[LISA] Ah! You look like
a giant cupcake, Miss Cecily!

00:06:50.827 --> 00:06:52.579
[LUKE] Is that the compliment
you've been waiting for?

00:06:52.621 --> 00:06:54.080
[CECILY]
Ugh! Shut up, Luke!

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:57.375
Just kidding. So what brings
you all the way out here?

00:06:57.417 --> 00:06:58.627
Uh.

00:06:58.668 --> 00:07:02.380
Ahem. You'll be happy to know
I've brought you a new customer.

00:07:03.465 --> 00:07:04.966
Seriously?

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.134
[CECILY]
Her name is Elsa.

00:07:06.176 --> 00:07:08.762
She's got a dagger
she'd like to have repaired.

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.472
It's very special to me.

00:07:10.513 --> 00:07:13.099
I was hoping you might
be able to fix it.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.480
[LUKE]
It's a misericorde.

00:07:26.154 --> 00:07:28.365
What do you think?

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:31.117
[LUKE] The core's been
severely damaged.

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.661
It's not fixable.

00:07:32.702 --> 00:07:33.662
[gasps]

00:07:33.703 --> 00:07:35.455
Isn't there anything you can do?

00:07:35.497 --> 00:07:38.083
I'm afraid not.

00:07:38.124 --> 00:07:40.418
[LISA] Do you mind if
I do some maintenance on it?

00:07:40.460 --> 00:07:42.504
It won't fix it,
but it couldn't hurt.

00:07:42.545 --> 00:07:44.798
[LUKE]
Sure. I'll leave it up to you.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.257
Okay, let me see...

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.093
How come you're
making her do it?

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:49.594
I have other business
to attend to.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:50.762
Oh, yeah? Like what?

00:07:50.804 --> 00:07:54.140
It's business, Cecily,
and it's none of yours!

00:07:54.182 --> 00:07:55.934
Actually, you wanna come with?

00:07:55.976 --> 00:07:57.102
Ah?

00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:05.443
[CECILY whimpering]

00:08:07.946 --> 00:08:08.989
[yelps]

00:08:10.281 --> 00:08:11.741
What's up with you today?

00:08:11.783 --> 00:08:13.284
Huh? What do you mean?

00:08:13.326 --> 00:08:15.120
This pathway couldn't
get much smoother,

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.205
but you've tripped, like,
ten times already.

00:08:17.247 --> 00:08:18.832
Oh, you're exaggerating.

00:08:18.873 --> 00:08:21.960
Not even. What, are you
nervous or something?

00:08:22.002 --> 00:08:23.712
Don't be ridiculous, Luke!

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.047
Being alone with a man
doesn't make me nervous.

00:08:26.089 --> 00:08:28.216
No, not one bit!
In fact, yesterday,

00:08:28.258 --> 00:08:31.177
I was on patrol with a man
and we were alone all day.

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:33.179
[LUKE laughs]

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:36.766
Whatever you say. It's not
like I bite or anything.

00:08:36.808 --> 00:08:38.643
So there's no need
to be nervous.

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:41.312
[gasps]
I told you, I'm not!

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.605
Did I embarrass you?

00:08:42.647 --> 00:08:44.941
No, just leave me alone.

00:08:44.983 --> 00:08:46.609
Jeez, you're stubborn.

00:08:46.651 --> 00:08:49.112
Just like someone
I used to know.

00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:52.198
I remind you of someone? Who?

00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:53.491
Forget about it.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:54.868
[growls]

00:08:54.909 --> 00:08:56.327
Fine, then would you
at least tell me

00:08:56.369 --> 00:08:57.370
where the hell we're going?

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.456
You'll know when we're there.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.500
Okay, so what are
the flowers for, then?

00:09:02.542 --> 00:09:04.252
Just a little gift.

00:09:04.294 --> 00:09:06.963
Wait a minute.
A gift for who?

00:09:07.005 --> 00:09:08.923
Enough with all the questions.

00:09:10.717 --> 00:09:12.177
What're you doing?

00:09:17.182 --> 00:09:19.684
What in the world are you up to?

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:22.687
[LISA] Sorry, but I won't
be going with you.

00:09:22.729 --> 00:09:25.231
[CECILY]
I wonder why Lisa didn't come.

00:09:25.273 --> 00:09:27.150
I don't know what's going on.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.945
I'm sorry about this.
You could've gone with them.

00:09:30.987 --> 00:09:34.532
It's fine. I wasn't planning
on joining them anyway.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:38.286
Usually, he makes
the trip alone.

00:09:38.328 --> 00:09:40.497
That's just how
it's always been.

00:09:40.538 --> 00:09:42.832
Are you and Lisa
fighting or something?

00:09:42.874 --> 00:09:44.459
Not at all, why do you ask?

00:09:44.501 --> 00:09:46.002
Are you sure?

00:09:46.044 --> 00:09:47.837
What are you getting at, Cecily?

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:50.673
Not a thing.

00:09:50.715 --> 00:09:54.469
Lisa does a lot to help me,
and I have no complaints.

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:55.845
But sometimes...

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:56.888
What?

00:09:56.930 --> 00:10:01.017
I worry I don't do enough
to make her happy.

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:02.977
Remember that day
you took her shopping?

00:10:03.019 --> 00:10:04.604
I bought her a hat.

00:10:04.646 --> 00:10:07.607
She was so grateful,
she kept thanking me.

00:10:07.649 --> 00:10:09.776
That was the first time
I ever even made an effort

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.028
to do something nice for her.

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:16.241
[LUKE]
I'm so clueless.

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:19.244
I mean, she does nice things
for me all the time.

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:23.665
I'm worried, someday, she won't
wanna be my assistant anymore.

00:10:23.706 --> 00:10:25.291
I don't even know
if she enjoys it.

00:10:25.333 --> 00:10:27.502
What if she wants to
do something else?

00:10:27.544 --> 00:10:30.296
[CECILY] You're being
too hard on yourself, Luke.

00:10:30.338 --> 00:10:32.423
I can tell that Lisa likes
being around you--

00:10:32.465 --> 00:10:35.051
She trusts you, and I'm pretty
darn sure if she didn't,

00:10:35.093 --> 00:10:37.470
she would've taken off
a long time ago.

00:10:37.512 --> 00:10:39.472
You think so?

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:42.142
She's chosen to stand by
my side and be my assistant

00:10:42.183 --> 00:10:43.476
because she likes it?

00:10:43.518 --> 00:10:45.770
Well, yeah,
I think it's obvious.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:47.689
I hope you're right.

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.568
Why're you so worried
about her all of a sudden?

00:10:51.609 --> 00:10:53.027
I always worry.

00:10:53.069 --> 00:10:55.196
You do? Why?

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:58.533
Because protecting her
is my reason for being.

00:10:58.575 --> 00:11:01.119
I would give my life for Lisa.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:07.959
[ELSA grunts]

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:17.385
[LISA] Your dagger feels
kinda sad. I wonder why.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.679
Almost as if it's crying.

00:11:19.721 --> 00:11:21.014
[ELSA grunts]

00:11:21.055 --> 00:11:23.391
That's why I wanted
to do maintenance on it.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:25.310
You think that'll help somehow?

00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:28.855
I don't know.
But it's worth a try.

00:11:30.273 --> 00:11:34.527
[ELSA] The name "misericorde"
actually means "mercy."

00:11:34.569 --> 00:11:36.863
It's used to kill
an injured knight.

00:11:36.905 --> 00:11:39.699
To put them out of their misery.

00:11:39.741 --> 00:11:42.410
Well, if it keeps them from
suffering, that's a good thing.

00:11:42.452 --> 00:11:43.453
[ELSA]
Yeah.

00:11:43.494 --> 00:11:46.247
Many years ago, they say a
valiant knight gave that dagger

00:11:46.289 --> 00:11:49.876
to his daughter before
he went away to war.

00:11:49.918 --> 00:11:52.921
He told her, "No matter
how weakened I am,

00:11:52.962 --> 00:11:56.257
I will return home, so I may
be set free from this world

00:11:56.299 --> 00:12:00.220
at the hands of my
beloved daughter."

00:12:00.261 --> 00:12:02.222
But when the knight
finally returned...

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:08.186
No...!

00:12:10.396 --> 00:12:14.651
[ELSA] ...the young girl, the
one who was supposed to live,

00:12:14.692 --> 00:12:16.277
was dead.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:21.616
After that day, everything
changed forever.

00:12:21.658 --> 00:12:24.661
And somehow the dagger
was broken.

00:12:24.702 --> 00:12:26.913
If it could be fixed,
what happened in the past

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:30.917
would be fixed. And isn't
that why you came to see us?

00:12:30.959 --> 00:12:33.670
[gasps]
Elsa. I'm sorry!

00:12:33.711 --> 00:12:37.257
No. It's fine--
you don't have to apologize.

00:12:37.298 --> 00:12:40.760
There's no way to change the
past. What happened, happened.

00:12:49.644 --> 00:12:51.854
--Lisa?
--Lisa Oakwood.

00:12:51.896 --> 00:12:55.316
She was a very dear friend
of mine when I was younger.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:58.611
But I was unable to protect her.

00:12:58.653 --> 00:13:00.154
[gasps]

00:13:08.162 --> 00:13:10.498
[LUKE]
Lisa Oakwood.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.750
It's my fault that she's gone.

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:14.544
Come on, it couldn't have been.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:16.170
It was.

00:13:19.465 --> 00:13:20.508
[gasps]

00:13:20.550 --> 00:13:22.844
[LUKE]
Yeah, that's just a coincidence.

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:25.096
[CECILY]
So it's named after this Lisa.

00:13:25.138 --> 00:13:28.224
[LUKE] We were about as close
as two people our age could be.

00:13:28.266 --> 00:13:30.518
But she was killed by
Valbanill three years ago.

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:33.229
Ah-- Wait, hold on a second.

00:13:33.271 --> 00:13:34.939
Who did you say
she was killed by?

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:36.274
You heard what I said.

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:38.651
But everybody knows
the story of Valbanill is just

00:13:38.693 --> 00:13:40.111
some silly myth.

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:42.113
That's not true.
I've seen him myself.

00:13:42.155 --> 00:13:43.364
[gasps]

00:13:43.406 --> 00:13:45.491
I assure you, Valbanill exists.

00:13:45.533 --> 00:13:47.118
No way...

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:51.289
And it's only
a matter of time until...

00:13:51.331 --> 00:13:54.167
...he comes down from
the mountain again.

00:13:55.543 --> 00:13:57.503
[LUKE] That day, Lisa and I
followed my father

00:13:57.545 --> 00:14:00.631
down to his shop.
Atelier Tatara.

00:14:00.673 --> 00:14:03.092
This sucks. Why can't I help?

00:14:03.134 --> 00:14:05.386
I thought I was supposed
to be his apprentice.

00:14:05.428 --> 00:14:06.471
[LISA OAKWOOD]
It's not big a deal.

00:14:06.512 --> 00:14:09.223
He's probably just working on
something really important.

00:14:09.265 --> 00:14:11.434
Well, he didn't have
to kick me out!

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.895
So how do you like
the katana I made you?

00:14:13.936 --> 00:14:15.772
[LISA OAKWOOD]
I absolutely love it.

00:14:15.813 --> 00:14:18.191
I'm sure this one is just
the first of many you'll forge

00:14:18.232 --> 00:14:19.901
for me over the years, Luke.

00:14:19.942 --> 00:14:21.569
I'll need a lot more practice.

00:14:21.611 --> 00:14:22.570
What was that?

00:14:22.612 --> 00:14:24.947
You trying to tell me you made
me a busted sword or somethin'?

00:14:24.989 --> 00:14:26.699
No, it's not "busted!"

00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.452
I did the best I could, I just
need to get better at it.

00:14:29.494 --> 00:14:31.079
Yeah, well, I think
it's perfect.

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.538
[LUKE]
Oh no, it's not!

00:14:32.580 --> 00:14:34.248
I will forge
a perfect sword someday,

00:14:34.290 --> 00:14:35.833
but that one's not even close.

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:39.837
[LISA OAKWOOD] Be careful.
Tamahagane... is real expensive.

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:43.549
You are gettin'
pretty good at that.

00:14:43.591 --> 00:14:46.427
I hope so, 'cause I
practice every day!

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:49.555
That's the only way I'll
become a master swordsman.

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.766
I wish I could
practice every day.

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:54.227
[LISA OAKWOOD]
Aw, don't cry, Luke.

00:14:55.561 --> 00:14:58.439
When I'm a knight, I promise
I'll do my best to protect you!

00:14:58.481 --> 00:15:00.191
Wha--

00:15:00.233 --> 00:15:03.611
As a knight, it'll be my duty to
protect everyone in this city.

00:15:03.653 --> 00:15:04.612
Including you!

00:15:04.654 --> 00:15:06.531
[LUKE] You can't protect
anyone with a crappy sword.

00:15:06.572 --> 00:15:09.992
[laughs] That's true,
you're gonna have to practice so

00:15:10.034 --> 00:15:12.620
you can forge a perfect
katana for me someday.

00:15:12.662 --> 00:15:14.914
--[LUKE] Hmph!
--[giggles]

00:15:14.956 --> 00:15:15.915
Oh!

00:15:15.957 --> 00:15:18.668
So've ya heard about the weird
caves on the edge of the forest?

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:20.711
You don't mean the ones that're
leading up to Mount Blair,

00:15:20.753 --> 00:15:23.631
do you? 'Cause those caves
are off limits.

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:24.966
Wanna go check 'em out?

00:15:25.007 --> 00:15:27.969
Huh?! Didn't you hear
what I just said?

00:15:28.010 --> 00:15:30.388
C'mon, just for
a quick look around.

00:15:30.430 --> 00:15:32.473
Unless you're tryin'
to say you're scared.

00:15:32.515 --> 00:15:34.058
Not that there's any
reason to be, I mean,

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:36.853
I am gonna be there
to protect you, ya big wuss!

00:15:36.894 --> 00:15:40.606
Ah! Agh! Who the heck
you callin' a wuss?

00:15:40.648 --> 00:15:41.983
Heh.

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:45.361
[LUKE]
We were such stupid kids.

00:15:45.403 --> 00:15:47.864
We kept walking deeper
and deeper into the caves

00:15:47.905 --> 00:15:49.740
to try and scare each other.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.870
[LUKE] And then,
without warning, there he was.

00:15:53.911 --> 00:15:55.663
[VALBANILL snarls]

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.415
A-Ah...

00:15:57.457 --> 00:15:58.833
[BOTH gasp]

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.626
[VALBANILL growling]

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.341
--Get back!
--Gah!

00:16:07.383 --> 00:16:08.801
Hah!

00:16:08.843 --> 00:16:13.431
Ah! Ah-- Ah!
[screams]

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:16.392
Lisa, come back!

00:16:19.562 --> 00:16:21.063
[splorch]

00:16:22.940 --> 00:16:24.901
[LUKE]
Lisa died that day...

00:16:24.942 --> 00:16:28.821
And so did my father
who came looking for us.

00:16:28.863 --> 00:16:30.823
I couldn't do anything
to save them.

00:16:30.865 --> 00:16:33.576
I just stood there and watched.

00:16:33.618 --> 00:16:35.870
They were killed.
Violently murdered.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:38.080
And I couldn't do anything.

00:16:38.122 --> 00:16:41.667
I just ran away.
Ran away like the coward I am!

00:16:41.709 --> 00:16:42.752
I failed them!

00:16:42.793 --> 00:16:44.086
[CECILY]
Easy, Luke!

00:16:44.128 --> 00:16:45.630
[panting]

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:48.090
It's okay. Calm down.

00:16:49.926 --> 00:16:52.220
Sorry, Cecily.

00:16:52.261 --> 00:16:53.387
I'll be fine.

00:16:53.429 --> 00:16:54.430
[CECILY gasps]

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:57.558
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have
bored you with that story.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.060
No, uh...

00:17:00.102 --> 00:17:02.146
I have to ask...

00:17:02.188 --> 00:17:05.274
Why did you bring me
to the cemetery with you?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.360
To be honest, I'm not real sure.

00:17:07.401 --> 00:17:10.404
There's just, I dunno,
something about you.

00:17:10.446 --> 00:17:12.323
That reminds me a lot of her.

00:17:12.365 --> 00:17:13.824
[CECILY gasps]

00:17:19.247 --> 00:17:20.206
[LISA]
Here you go.

00:17:20.248 --> 00:17:22.750
Sorry I couldn't fix it,
but I did the best I could.

00:17:22.792 --> 00:17:25.628
[ELSA] It's okay.
Thank you for trying though.

00:17:27.505 --> 00:17:30.550
'Scuse me, Elsa?
Try to stay strong, okay?

00:17:30.591 --> 00:17:33.970
Remember, all that matters
is the present, not the past.

00:17:34.011 --> 00:17:35.846
[ELSA]
You really think so?

00:17:35.888 --> 00:17:37.598
You're able to completely
forget your past

00:17:37.640 --> 00:17:39.600
and live only in the present?

00:17:39.642 --> 00:17:44.355
I do try. Because I think
it's very important.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:45.982
Thank you.

00:17:47.316 --> 00:17:49.819
I wonder how it's going
between Cecily and Luke.

00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:51.279
[giggles]

00:17:51.320 --> 00:17:54.448
I hate to spy on them,
but I just have to know!

00:17:54.490 --> 00:17:55.658
Huh?

00:18:00.997 --> 00:18:03.791
[gasps]
That girl...

00:18:08.754 --> 00:18:10.214
[CECILY]
Poor Luke...

00:18:10.256 --> 00:18:13.134
I didn't know he's had
such a hard life.

00:18:13.175 --> 00:18:15.428
I feel like I don't
know him at all.

00:18:15.469 --> 00:18:18.389
I kept thinking we'd become
closer if only we could

00:18:18.431 --> 00:18:20.850
get to know each other better.

00:18:20.891 --> 00:18:25.938
But it feels like... the more I
know, the father apart we get.

00:18:30.234 --> 00:18:31.611
[LUKE]
See ya.

00:18:35.197 --> 00:18:37.116
Ah-- Mm...

00:18:37.158 --> 00:18:38.242
Luke!

00:18:41.621 --> 00:18:43.122
[LUKE]
What is it?

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:47.168
[CECILY]
Uh... I was... wondering...

00:18:47.209 --> 00:18:49.211
Did you love Lisa?

00:18:51.589 --> 00:18:54.091
At one time, I did, yes.

00:18:54.133 --> 00:18:56.093
[gasps]

00:18:56.135 --> 00:18:58.512
But that doesn't matter anymore.

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:12.443
[OLD MAN]
Were you able to find him?

00:19:12.485 --> 00:19:14.153
[gasps]

00:19:14.195 --> 00:19:15.696
[OLD MAN]
Tell me, child.

00:19:15.738 --> 00:19:18.824
Were you able to sense
the presence of Valbanill?

00:19:20.618 --> 00:19:24.789
Excuse me, sir.
But do you remember this dagger?

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.249
[OLD MAN]
Hmm? I've never seen it.

00:19:27.291 --> 00:19:28.751
[gasps]

00:19:30.628 --> 00:19:32.421
[OLD MAN]
That man told me he was here.

00:19:32.463 --> 00:19:34.840
There's someone in this city
with Valbanill's blood

00:19:34.882 --> 00:19:36.133
coursing through their veins.

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:39.136
[ELSA] But sir, I don't know
about the man in black.

00:19:39.178 --> 00:19:40.596
Are you sure that
he can be trusted?

00:19:40.638 --> 00:19:41.847
[OLD MAN]
Why should I doubt him?!

00:19:41.889 --> 00:19:45.351
Because of Valbanill, my beloved
daughter Elsa is dead!

00:19:45.393 --> 00:19:47.645
I swear I will kill him!

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:51.065
I'll do whatever it takes
to get revenge, you hear me?

00:19:51.107 --> 00:19:53.984
The bastard! I'll kill him!

00:19:54.026 --> 00:19:55.820
[coughing]

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:56.821
[gasps]

00:19:56.862 --> 00:19:58.531
[coughing]

00:19:58.572 --> 00:20:01.200
[ELSA] Are you all right?
You mustn't get so worked up!

00:20:01.242 --> 00:20:05.579
[ELSA'S FATHER coughs]
I must... find Valbanill.

00:20:05.621 --> 00:20:08.541
[coughing]

00:20:08.582 --> 00:20:10.167
I've found him, sir.

00:20:11.252 --> 00:20:13.337
[CECILY]
Ha! Ah!

00:20:13.379 --> 00:20:16.382
[panting]

00:20:21.095 --> 00:20:24.682
I'm sorry to bother you, but I
was just wondering if you--

00:20:24.724 --> 00:20:28.269
[CECILY]
Ha! Hngh! Hnn!

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:31.105
Well. I guess I'll
ask her tomorrow.

00:20:44.994 --> 00:20:46.454
[LUKE] The rain seems
to be getting worse.

00:20:46.495 --> 00:20:48.456
It's pretty weird 'cause
the birds usually tell me

00:20:48.497 --> 00:20:51.250
when it's supposed to rain.
I wonder why they didn't.

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:52.209
Who knows?

00:20:52.251 --> 00:20:55.629
I don't really mind it though.
It washes everything away.

00:20:55.671 --> 00:20:57.965
Did something happen
at the cemetery?

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.093
I thought it was strange that
Miss Cecily didn't come back

00:21:01.135 --> 00:21:02.928
with you. Did you
get in a fight?

00:21:04.221 --> 00:21:05.514
No.

00:21:08.851 --> 00:21:11.687
[ELSA'S FATHER wheezing]

00:21:15.983 --> 00:21:19.528
[ELSA'S FATHER huffing]

00:21:19.570 --> 00:21:20.654
[gasps]

00:21:20.696 --> 00:21:21.906
Lisa!

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.282
Okay.

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:25.409
Who the hell is that?

00:21:25.451 --> 00:21:27.745
[ELSA'S FATHER] At last,
I've found you, Valbanill!

00:21:27.787 --> 00:21:28.996
[gasps]

00:21:29.038 --> 00:21:31.791
I'll make you pay, you bastard!

00:21:31.832 --> 00:21:35.419
I've been waiting
for this day, Valbanill!

00:21:40.883 --> 00:21:42.301
[ELSA'S FATHER]
Ha...!

00:21:42.343 --> 00:21:43.677
[LUKE grunts]

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.850
Why is that man
attacking us, Luke?

00:21:49.892 --> 00:21:50.893
I have no clue.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:53.062
But he's dangerous--
he's got a Demon Sword.

00:21:53.103 --> 00:21:54.939
Just stay put, okay?

00:21:56.357 --> 00:21:58.192
[LUKE] Wanna tell me
who you are, old man?

00:21:58.234 --> 00:21:59.860
[ELSA'S FATHER]
Your worst nightmare!

00:21:59.902 --> 00:22:01.153
[LUKE grunts]

00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:04.448
That was close.

00:22:04.490 --> 00:22:06.575
I will kill you.

00:22:06.992 --> 00:22:08.118
[gasps]

00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.120
[ELSA'S FATHER cackles]

00:22:10.162 --> 00:22:11.622
Lisa, run!

00:22:11.664 --> 00:22:13.833
Now... die!

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:16.460
Valbanill!

00:22:16.502 --> 00:22:18.087
Ah!

00:22:18.128 --> 00:22:20.005
Lisa!
