[CECILY growls]

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.357
[DORIS]
Hmm...

00:00:23.398 --> 00:00:25.067
So this is Cambell House, huh?

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.277
It's a lot smaller than
I thought it would be.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:30.113
I thought you were
a noblewoman, Cecily.

00:00:30.155 --> 00:00:31.823
I'm a former noble.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.992
You didn't say that before!

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.703
Well, I would've if you'd
let me get a word in edgewise!

00:00:36.745 --> 00:00:38.580
That's enough, Doris.

00:00:38.622 --> 00:00:42.167
We'll just have to deal until
the Emperor gives us his reply.

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.002
It's not that bad...

00:00:44.044 --> 00:00:47.464
[CHARLOTTE] It's better than
staying at some run-down hotel.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.049
Ah... Ah!

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:51.718
[FIO] I've heard just about
enough out of you little lady.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.221
You're lucky to be staying
at the Cambell House.

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.889
What do you think you're
doing to the princess?!

00:00:55.931 --> 00:00:58.016
--Yeah, unhand her!
--How dare you manhandle her!

00:00:58.058 --> 00:00:59.643
[FIO]
Quitcher yappin'!

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.187
I'm the keeper of
Cambell House, Fio Adkins.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:04.356
Which means I'm in charge
of everything that goes on

00:01:04.398 --> 00:01:05.440
in this place.

00:01:05.482 --> 00:01:07.568
What I say goes.

00:01:10.279 --> 00:01:12.698
But you're nothing more
than a lowly servant girl!

00:01:12.739 --> 00:01:14.741
You have no right to speak
to a princess that way!

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:17.244
I don't really give
a crap who you are, kid.

00:01:17.286 --> 00:01:18.453
[gasps]

00:01:18.495 --> 00:01:21.331
[FIO] Royalty or not, in my
eyes, you're just a bunch of

00:01:21.373 --> 00:01:24.376
freeloaders, and I
don't put up with that.

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:27.421
In fact, we have a saying
in my family.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.755
[CHARLOTTE gulps]

00:01:28.797 --> 00:01:32.801
There's only one thing
to give a mooch.

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:33.969
Death.

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.192
[groaning]

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.404
You three look
absolutely precious!

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:16.571
[CECILY] And stupid.
[chuckles]

00:03:16.613 --> 00:03:18.907
[DORIS] Quit laughing!
I'm gonna get you for this!

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:21.910
It's bad enough to make us
wear these frilly maid outfits,

00:03:21.952 --> 00:03:23.912
but I can't believe you're
forcing Princess Charlotte

00:03:23.954 --> 00:03:26.248
to wear one, too!

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:28.625
You're gonna pay!

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:33.463
Doris, no!

00:03:33.505 --> 00:03:34.923
Damn you!

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:37.217
[groaning]

00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:38.385
[CECILY]
Wow, Fio.

00:03:38.427 --> 00:03:40.762
Don'tcha think maybe you're
being a little rough on them?

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.889
[FIO] They're getting
their just desserts, Miss.

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:45.183
I will not allow these three
brats to make a mockery

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:46.643
of the Cambell House.

00:03:46.685 --> 00:03:48.228
--And you.
--Ah!

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.106
I heard you ordered them
to attack Miss Cecily.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:52.816
Well, you better be
on your best behavior,

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:55.068
'cause I got my
eye on you, missy.

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.821
Um, okay, I promise I'll
behave from now on.

00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:01.241
[FIO] Good, 'cause
I hate diggin' graves.

00:04:01.283 --> 00:04:03.452
[CHARLOTTE]
Poor Doris...

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.120
[BOTH chuckling]

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:07.664
Fine! I see what you guys
are trying to do here.

00:04:07.706 --> 00:04:09.458
To prove that we're
not freeloaders,

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.294
the four of us will work
to repay you for our stay.

00:04:12.335 --> 00:04:13.378
However!

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.422
I want you to work with us!

00:04:15.464 --> 00:04:17.090
Uh. Who me?

00:04:17.132 --> 00:04:19.050
All you ever do is
stand there and smirk.

00:04:19.092 --> 00:04:21.845
It's only fair that
you do your part, too!

00:04:21.887 --> 00:04:23.346
You're delusional.

00:04:23.388 --> 00:04:25.056
I'm the one who's
in charge here, you know.

00:04:25.098 --> 00:04:26.641
Huh, not a bad idea, kid.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:29.770
Don't you think this sort
of thing is best left

00:04:29.811 --> 00:04:30.937
to the professionals?

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:33.106
And let's not forget that I'm
the master of the Cambell House.

00:04:33.148 --> 00:04:35.150
Plus, not only that,
but I'm also a very busy knight,

00:04:35.192 --> 00:04:36.985
so I don't have time
for household chores.

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:38.236
Besides, I don't
look good in ruffles--

00:04:38.278 --> 00:04:39.738
--they kinda give me hives.
--[FIO] Save your breath, Miss.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.282
This isn't funny, Fio!
Let go of me right now!

00:04:43.325 --> 00:04:46.661
My goodness. What's all
the commotion in here about?

00:04:46.703 --> 00:04:48.497
Oh, hello, Mrs. Cambell.

00:04:48.538 --> 00:04:51.958
It seems you have some new
servants, at least temporarily.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.418
Well, that's wonderful.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:56.797
As they say, "the more
the merrier," right?

00:04:58.924 --> 00:05:00.592
[CECILY whimpers]
Calm down, Fio!

00:05:00.634 --> 00:05:02.844
I'm telling you,
this is not a good idea!

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.679
Don't worry. This won't hurt.

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:06.389
It'll be over
before you know it.

00:05:06.431 --> 00:05:08.266
[CECILY] Cut it out!
I demand you stop!

00:05:08.308 --> 00:05:09.559
[FIO]
Yeah, yeah.

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:12.813
Wah! Why's this happening to me?

00:05:16.441 --> 00:05:19.069
[LISA] We picked up
a bunch of scrap metal today!

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.364
Yeah, but walking around
to collect it is such a pain.

00:05:22.405 --> 00:05:23.907
I don't think you should
be complaining when

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:25.700
we're getting it all for free!

00:05:25.742 --> 00:05:27.369
[MAN A]
Hey! Got some more for you!

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.329
[gasps]
Coming!

00:05:29.371 --> 00:05:31.581
[MAN A] Here ya go.
You can take these two pieces.

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:34.334

Wow! Thank you so much, sir!

00:05:50.433 --> 00:05:52.727
[grunting, yelling]

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:00.610
[LUKE] Why'd I come
to her rescue again?

00:06:00.652 --> 00:06:02.529
I have better things
to do than get involved

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.656
in other people's business.

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.491
I have my own problems.

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:09.578
Memories that haunt me
to this very day.

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:12.247
So, why...?

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:17.669
[LUKE gasps]
Lisa?

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.379
[CECILY]
Oh! Um. Uh.

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.589
Luke!

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.425
Uh. Yeah, so, uh, what
the hell are you doing here?

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.177
[LUKE] I dunno, what the
hell're you wearing?

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.014
[LISA] Luke! Hey,
I've been looking for you.

00:06:29.055 --> 00:06:30.682
Something wrong?

00:06:30.724 --> 00:06:32.309
Ah!

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.979
Ahh! Oh, my goodness!
You look so cute, Miss Cecily!

00:06:36.021 --> 00:06:37.606
So why're you dressed
like a maid?

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:40.108
Uh, Fio is forcing me to wear
this while I do chores

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.484
for the Cambell House.

00:06:41.526 --> 00:06:43.528
Doesn't she work for you?

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:46.156
Don't look at meeee!

00:06:46.197 --> 00:06:48.033
[LISA]
Uh-oh. The apples!

00:06:52.662 --> 00:06:54.956
I don't understand why
you're so embarrassed.

00:06:54.998 --> 00:06:57.918
Well... I'm supposed
to be a fearless knight...

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.377
And now I'm all frilly!

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.880
Yeah, well. You don't
have to freak out.

00:07:01.922 --> 00:07:03.298
It looks good on you.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.382
[gasps]

00:07:04.424 --> 00:07:07.719
Huh. I don't think I've
ever seen you blush before.

00:07:08.595 --> 00:07:10.597
[CECILY]
You...!

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.725
--Ah!
--Don't look at me!

00:07:15.352 --> 00:07:18.730
[LISA] Miss Cecily!
You forgot your apples!

00:07:18.772 --> 00:07:21.650
Gah. What the hell
did I do this time?

00:07:29.658 --> 00:07:32.327
[CECILY] I still don't
understand why I have to help.

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:36.081
[coughing]

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:38.750
Hey! Watch it!
I just swept over there!

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.585
All you ever do is
get in the way, Cecily.

00:07:40.627 --> 00:07:42.629
Oh. Sorry 'bout that.

00:07:46.091 --> 00:07:49.260
Here we go. There.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:52.597
So, um, how many boxes
are there in here anyway?

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.349
[CHARLOTTE]
I dunno, it's your house.

00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:57.018
I just never realized
there were so many.

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.019
[wood creaking]

00:07:58.061 --> 00:07:59.771
[PENELOPE]
Cecily, watch out!

00:08:00.772 --> 00:08:02.816
[CECILY grunts]

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:06.569
[ALL coughing]

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:10.407
I swear. You can't
do anything right, can you?

00:08:10.448 --> 00:08:12.409
[CECILY] Fio always
takes care of this stuff.

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.202
[PENELOPE]
Hmm? All by herself?

00:08:14.244 --> 00:08:18.081
You mean, you don't ever help
her do anything around here?

00:08:18.123 --> 00:08:19.249
[CECILY]
Um, no?

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.417
[DORIS]
Princess Charlotte?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.502
Should we start cleaning
the armor next?

00:08:22.544 --> 00:08:24.462
[CHARLOTTE] Let's air it out
in the courtyard a little first.

00:08:24.504 --> 00:08:26.089
[DORIS]
Good call!

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.842
So, how is it that you're so
good at all this cleaning stuff?

00:08:28.883 --> 00:08:30.719
Princesses don't do chores.

00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:33.680
True. But I'm a
well-rounded princess.

00:08:33.722 --> 00:08:37.225
So I've learned to cook and
clean with the best of 'em.

00:08:37.267 --> 00:08:38.643
[CHARLOTTE] These girls
have taught me what it's like

00:08:38.685 --> 00:08:40.437
to live a normal life.

00:08:40.478 --> 00:08:41.813
[CECILY]
A normal life?

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:44.858
Thanks to them, I know how to do
even the most mundane tasks.

00:08:44.899 --> 00:08:46.943
But if you're a princess,
you shouldn't have to do--

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.445
[MARGOT]
Move it, Cecily!

00:08:48.486 --> 00:08:50.238
[DORIS]
You're kinda in the way!

00:08:54.409 --> 00:08:55.535
[gasps]

00:08:55.577 --> 00:08:58.913
[crashing, clattering]

00:08:58.955 --> 00:09:00.373
[CHARLOTTE]
You are the clumsiest person

00:09:00.415 --> 00:09:01.541
I have ever met.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:02.751
[CECILY]
Yeah.

00:09:02.792 --> 00:09:04.210
Ow?

00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:09.174
Good work, girls.
You guys got a lot done today.

00:09:09.215 --> 00:09:11.259
Why don't you go
have a nice bath?

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:17.307
[GIRLS sighing]
Much better...

00:09:17.348 --> 00:09:19.684
You know, Cecily, I think you
may be the biggest klutz

00:09:19.726 --> 00:09:21.019
on the planet.

00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.772
Probably because her giant
knockers get in the way.

00:09:23.813 --> 00:09:25.774
Right? They're so big,
I wanna squeeze 'em.

00:09:25.815 --> 00:09:27.358
--[DORIS, MARGOT] Yeah.
--Squeeze 'em?!

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.943
[MARGOT]
I gotcha!

00:09:28.985 --> 00:09:30.195
Honk, honk!

[CECILY whines]

[GIRLS giggling, chatting]

00:09:32.655 --> 00:09:35.825
[OLD LADY chuckling]

00:09:39.162 --> 00:09:41.206
We can't go back yet.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.249
Y'know, not till you finally
decide to hand over

00:09:43.291 --> 00:09:45.001
the Demon Sword of Wind.

00:09:45.043 --> 00:09:47.003
That's not gonna happen,
so give it up.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:48.713
[CHARLOTTE]
I'm not leaving here without it.

00:09:48.755 --> 00:09:49.964
Guess you're stuck with me.

00:09:50.006 --> 00:09:51.966
[sighs] You've already
got four of them--

00:09:52.008 --> 00:09:53.718
why do you need another one?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:55.970
What difference do you think
Aria's going to make?

00:09:56.012 --> 00:09:58.598
I must have it.
Without that sword,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.351
I may never be able to
fulfill my mother's wish.

00:10:01.392 --> 00:10:04.771
But why don't you just explain
to her you couldn't get it?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:07.524
[CHARLOTTE] I can't.
She passed away a year ago.

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:12.529
[CECILY gasps]
I'm sorry. I had no idea...

00:10:12.570 --> 00:10:13.780
It's okay.

00:10:13.822 --> 00:10:17.033
I probably should've
told you that before.

00:10:17.075 --> 00:10:18.993
[CECILY]
So, your dagger...

00:10:19.035 --> 00:10:20.578
[CHARLOTTE] The Emperor
gave it to my mother,

00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:23.081
and she passed it along
to me when she died.

00:10:23.123 --> 00:10:25.500
It's the only proof
I have left of my lineage.

00:10:25.542 --> 00:10:28.753
Hey, Charlotte?
Can I ask you something?

00:10:28.795 --> 00:10:32.298
I don't mean to pry,
but what was your mother's wish?

00:10:34.926 --> 00:10:38.555
[CHARLOTTE] My mother always
wanted to return to the Empire

00:10:38.596 --> 00:10:41.015
and be recognized as nobility.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.312
[CHARLOTTE] She never
said it to me outright,

00:10:46.354 --> 00:10:50.316
but I know she longed for
the Emperor's approval.

00:10:50.358 --> 00:10:52.986
Even as a child,
I could see that.

00:10:53.027 --> 00:10:55.488
My mother never
badmouthed the Emperor,

00:10:55.530 --> 00:10:58.700
even after all the pain
he had put her through.

00:10:58.741 --> 00:11:01.995
She just waited...
for him to recognize us.

00:11:02.036 --> 00:11:06.541
And eventually, the heartbreak
of waiting took its toll on her.

00:11:06.583 --> 00:11:08.376
Until the very end,
she truly believed

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.628
the Emperor would come around.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.838
And if my mother
believed in him,

00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.757
then I can't help but think
that I should, too.

00:11:17.552 --> 00:11:19.888
If he would acknowledge
me as his daughter,

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:23.683
maybe he'd recognize
my mother as a noble as well.

00:11:23.725 --> 00:11:27.103
That's my hope--
to fulfill her wish.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.315
[DORIS]
Get your hands off my meat!

00:11:30.356 --> 00:11:31.858
[MARGOT]
No fair! I already claimed it!

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.860
[PENELOPE]
Would you two quit fighting?

00:11:33.902 --> 00:11:35.612
[ARIA] Better grab some
pasta before it's gone.

00:11:35.653 --> 00:11:37.155
So yummy!

00:11:37.197 --> 00:11:40.033
Never woulda thought a sword
could put it away like you can.

00:11:40.074 --> 00:11:41.784
Food always tastes better
when you're surrounded

00:11:41.826 --> 00:11:43.161
with good company.

00:11:43.203 --> 00:11:44.454
Wouldn't you agree?

00:11:44.495 --> 00:11:45.496
Yeah.

00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.332
So, how's your
dinner, Charlotte?

00:11:47.373 --> 00:11:48.750
I hope it's to your liking.

00:11:48.791 --> 00:11:50.376
There's stuff I've
never tried before,

00:11:50.418 --> 00:11:52.086
but my mom taught me
not to be picky.

00:11:52.128 --> 00:11:54.255
It certainly sounds like your
mother raised you well.

00:11:54.297 --> 00:11:57.258
Oh! I bet you've never
tried lobster before.

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:58.885
I think you'll like it.

[FIO] Well, of course it is.
Half my job is in the kitchen!

I'm a pretty awesome chef!

00:12:12.106 --> 00:12:13.358
[PENELOPE]
Guess what, Princess Charlotte?

00:12:13.399 --> 00:12:15.068
I helped Fio make dinner.

00:12:15.109 --> 00:12:17.362
She was a great helper--
she's got potential.

done it without me.

as much as they do,

00:12:31.292 --> 00:12:33.044
our boobs will get that big?

look at Cecily's rack!

I'd eat a ton too if it'd
get me bigger ta-tas.

00:12:41.844 --> 00:12:44.180
You can have my plate, Penelope,
you need to eat this

00:12:44.222 --> 00:12:45.181
way more than I do!

Why do you always pick
on me like this, Margot?!

00:12:47.475 --> 00:12:49.644

the same size as yours!

I wasn't able
to protect you either.

Right.

[CECILY] As you can see,
this is where the Knight Guard

are keeping three of
their Demon Swords.

00:16:20.897 --> 00:16:22.940
And Evadne's being held
in one of the jail cells

different kinds
of Demon Swords.

Demons born of
the Demon Contract,

00:17:30.424 --> 00:17:32.927
who happen to take
the shape of a sword.

00:17:32.969 --> 00:17:34.595
That is what we are.

00:17:34.637 --> 00:17:37.431
[ARIA]
I know! That's not what I asked!

00:17:37.473 --> 00:17:40.601
I wanna know why
we exist in the first place!

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:44.313
Oh, you'll find out. Trust me.

00:17:44.355 --> 00:17:46.774
When the time comes,
you'll know.

00:17:48.276 --> 00:17:49.819
[gasps]

00:18:05.167 --> 00:18:06.752
Hey, uh, Cecily?

00:18:08.921 --> 00:18:12.008
Forget it, I'm not gonna switch
cleaning days with you again.

00:18:12.049 --> 00:18:14.302
[DORIS] No, why are you
treating us so well?

00:18:14.343 --> 00:18:15.469
You don't have to.

00:18:15.511 --> 00:18:17.054
What do you mean?

00:18:17.096 --> 00:18:18.139
[gasps]

00:18:18.180 --> 00:18:20.391
Even though we tried
to steal Aria from you,

00:18:20.433 --> 00:18:22.643
you're still nice to us.

00:18:22.685 --> 00:18:24.228
[CECILY]
Well, of course. Don't be silly.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.229
[gasping]

00:18:25.271 --> 00:18:27.106
Everybody makes
mistakes sometimes.

00:18:27.148 --> 00:18:29.150
I've forgiven you.

00:18:29.191 --> 00:18:30.359
[PENELOPE]
You have?

00:18:30.401 --> 00:18:31.902
Now that I've lived
with the three of you,

00:18:31.944 --> 00:18:33.362
I know you're good people.

00:18:33.404 --> 00:18:35.990
You're just trying
to make Charlotte happy.

00:18:36.032 --> 00:18:36.991
[ARIA chuckles]

00:18:37.033 --> 00:18:38.284
Yeah, we try.

00:18:38.326 --> 00:18:39.827
But you won't gain
anything from this--

00:18:39.869 --> 00:18:42.538
we can't even pay you
for letting us stay here.

00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:44.624
[CECILY] I'm not looking for
any kind of payment.

00:18:44.665 --> 00:18:47.209
I just happen to be
a nice person. [chuckles]

00:18:47.251 --> 00:18:49.045
Your father would've said
the same thing, Miss.

00:18:49.086 --> 00:18:51.964
You remind me so much of him
sometimes it's uncanny.

00:18:52.006 --> 00:18:53.841
Well, if Cecily
takes after her father,

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:55.926
it explains why she's
so masculine, huh?

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.553
[CECILY] "Masculine"?!
What're you talking about?!

00:18:57.595 --> 00:18:58.763
I'm as girly as you are!

00:18:58.804 --> 00:18:59.805
[GIRLS laughing]

00:18:59.847 --> 00:19:03.184
[CECILY growls] Okay, so maybe
I'm not as girly as you.

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.810
But still.

00:19:15.863 --> 00:19:17.198
[CHARLOTTE]
Mother!

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:19.158
[LUCY]
Huh?

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:21.202
Charlotte.

00:19:21.243 --> 00:19:23.329
Come in, child. It's okay.

00:19:26.957 --> 00:19:29.502
Isn't this breeze
just wonderful?

00:19:29.543 --> 00:19:30.961
Mrs. Cambell?

00:19:31.003 --> 00:19:33.422
Is there something
wrong, my dear?

00:19:33.464 --> 00:19:34.465
No, not at all.

00:19:34.507 --> 00:19:36.717
I just wanted to say thank you
for letting us stay here

00:19:36.759 --> 00:19:38.386
at Cambell House.

00:19:38.427 --> 00:19:39.804
I'm happy.

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:43.641
And I really have enjoyed
the time we've spent together.

00:19:43.683 --> 00:19:45.726
But soon, I'll get a reply
from the Emperor,

00:19:45.768 --> 00:19:48.354
and my time here
will come to an end.

00:19:48.396 --> 00:19:49.939
But I don't wanna leave.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:52.817
[sobs]
I feel so completely lost.

00:19:52.858 --> 00:19:56.612
This is the first time I've ever
felt like this and it scares me.

00:19:56.654 --> 00:19:58.614
I know it must be hard.

00:19:58.656 --> 00:20:01.325
[CHARLOTTE] Lately, I've been
thinking maybe it'd be better

00:20:01.367 --> 00:20:03.577
if I didn't go
back to the Empire.

00:20:03.619 --> 00:20:07.456
That maybe I should just stay
here where I'm happy.

00:20:07.498 --> 00:20:10.000
But no! I can't let
my own selfishness

00:20:10.042 --> 00:20:13.379
get in the way of fulfilling
my mother's wish.

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:16.799
I just... I couldn't
live with myself.

00:20:18.384 --> 00:20:21.470
[CHARLOTTE] All this time,
I've lived for the sole purpose

00:20:21.512 --> 00:20:24.098
of making my mother's
wish come true.

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:28.936
But now, I'm torn between her
dying wish and my own happiness.

00:20:28.978 --> 00:20:32.314
If I choose happiness,
do you think she'll forgive me?!

00:20:32.356 --> 00:20:33.899
Please help me...

00:20:33.941 --> 00:20:37.361
Tell me what to do,
Mrs. Cambell...

00:20:37.403 --> 00:20:39.864
[sobbing]

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.741
Charlotte, you poor thing.

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:43.492
[sobbing]

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:47.121
I'm sorry. I'm afraid I can't
make that decision for you,

00:20:47.163 --> 00:20:51.250
my dear. But I'm sure your
mother would want nothing more

00:20:51.292 --> 00:20:53.544
than for her daughter
to be happy.

00:20:54.962 --> 00:20:58.257
Really...? Do you think so...?

00:20:58.299 --> 00:21:02.136
[LUCY]
Mm-hmm. It's like I tell Cecily.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:04.138
Always remember this.

00:21:04.180 --> 00:21:06.390
"Do not live your life
for other's happiness,

00:21:06.432 --> 00:21:08.267
but for your own."

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.812
[CHARLOTTE]
Live... for my own happiness?

00:21:20.446 --> 00:21:23.657
Mrs. Cambell?
Are you sure that's okay?

00:21:24.867 --> 00:21:26.952
I'm sure.

00:21:26.994 --> 00:21:29.246
Your mother would be proud.

00:21:38.881 --> 00:21:41.342
I've finally received
a reply from the Emperor.

00:21:41.383 --> 00:21:43.719
Good. I'm ready
to hear what he says.

00:21:43.761 --> 00:21:46.597
Yes, I think we've all
waited long enough.

00:21:53.646 --> 00:21:55.898
"Dear Mayor Housman,
I regret to inform you

00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:58.859
I have no descendant with the
name Charlotte E. Firobisher."

00:21:58.901 --> 00:22:00.861
[gasping]

00:22:00.903 --> 00:22:02.655
[HOUSMAN] "These women
are bandits who have stolen

00:22:02.696 --> 00:22:04.615
our precious Demon Swords.

00:22:04.657 --> 00:22:07.368
They are abusing my good
name for their advantage.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:10.329
The dagger the child presented
to you is counterfeit.

00:22:10.371 --> 00:22:12.456
I ask that you please return
the Demon Swords

00:22:12.498 --> 00:22:14.291
you've confiscated.

00:22:14.333 --> 00:22:17.878
I also request extradition of
the imposters, as they've earned

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.088
the wrath of the Empire."

00:22:19.129 --> 00:22:21.257
[gasps]
