WEBVTT

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:16.600
[NARRATOR]
The heavens cried.

00:00:16.642 --> 00:00:18.810
The earth trembled.

00:00:23.482 --> 00:00:27.861
[NARRATOR] The world was torn
apart in a wave of fury...

00:00:27.903 --> 00:00:32.491
...the day he came to Earth.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:38.205
As prophesized, thus began
our eternal punishment.

00:00:38.247 --> 00:00:40.958
From that day forth,
the course of humanity

00:00:40.999 --> 00:00:43.126
would never be the same.

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:47.714
For he had come,
whispering in the darkness.

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:53.345
"Foolish humans, with your
miserable, pathetic souls."

00:00:53.387 --> 00:00:59.643
"Sign this Demon Contract,
and you will have salvation!"

00:01:01.687 --> 00:01:05.065
The merciless saw him
as their king.

00:01:05.107 --> 00:01:07.901
The fearful called
him "the beast."

00:01:07.943 --> 00:01:13.115
While the weak feared
he may be God himself.

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:16.243
His judgment brought
about destruction.

00:01:16.285 --> 00:01:20.122
The extermination
of life as he saw fit.

00:01:20.163 --> 00:01:25.085
Let those who resist
his call stand up.

00:01:25.127 --> 00:01:30.757
Let your hopeless
cries ring out:

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.928
"Arise and Slay God!"

00:03:13.402 --> 00:03:15.237
[CECILY gasping]

00:03:23.453 --> 00:03:26.498
What the--? How did you...?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.083
Thanks for the diversion.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.544
The katana came out perfectly.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.089
[LUKE]
Now leave this to me.

00:03:40.804 --> 00:03:42.431
[CECILY gasps]

00:03:44.558 --> 00:03:48.687
[CECILY] I guess this is
goodbye. Thank you, Father.

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:56.111
You okay, Miss Cecily?

00:03:56.153 --> 00:03:57.988
Yeah, I'll be fine.

00:04:00.824 --> 00:04:04.953
[LUKE] Pay attention, Cecily.
Now it's your turn to watch me.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.583
[LUKE]
See the power of my katana.

00:04:12.836 --> 00:04:17.424
[gasps] I've never seen
anything so beautiful.

00:04:17.466 --> 00:04:20.469
His katana looks
like it's on fire!

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:27.184
[screeches]

00:04:27.225 --> 00:04:28.393
[grunts]

00:04:33.815 --> 00:04:35.275
[LUKE yells]

00:04:42.574 --> 00:04:43.450
[CECILY gasps]

00:04:43.492 --> 00:04:47.704
[ICE DEMON growls]

00:04:58.381 --> 00:05:00.550
[CECILY]
That blade is incredible.

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:02.511
No sword I've ever seen
would have been able

00:05:02.552 --> 00:05:05.722
to slice through
that demon's leg.

00:05:05.764 --> 00:05:08.975
So that's the strength
of a katana.

00:05:09.017 --> 00:05:12.979
I'm totally in awe.
It's truly breathtaking.

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.816
Not too many blacksmiths
can forge katana these days.

00:05:15.857 --> 00:05:17.651
Most don't have the patience.

00:05:17.692 --> 00:05:19.194
To do it right,
you have to hammer

00:05:19.236 --> 00:05:21.446
and fold the steel repeatedly.

00:05:21.488 --> 00:05:23.657
That's what gives
it its strength.

00:05:23.698 --> 00:05:26.952
But folding steel isn't easy.
It takes a lot of hard work.

00:05:26.993 --> 00:05:29.746
That's why most blacksmiths
have given up the practice.

00:05:29.788 --> 00:05:32.374
They don't see the point in
spending days making one katana

00:05:32.415 --> 00:05:33.583
when in the same amount of time

00:05:33.625 --> 00:05:35.377
they can make hundreds
of swords by mold.

00:05:35.418 --> 00:05:37.546
But their swords are inferior.

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:40.549
Who knew something so strong
would be forged so delicately?

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.260
The katana Luke's using right
now is a little different.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.762
I guess you could
say it's special.

00:05:45.804 --> 00:05:50.392
[screeches]

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:59.150
What's going on?
Is that demon transforming?

00:06:08.243 --> 00:06:09.452
[CECILY]
Luke, be careful!

00:06:09.494 --> 00:06:11.621
Don't worry, I can handle it!

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.085
[LUKE grunting]

00:06:21.172 --> 00:06:23.800
Luke! Why aren't you
using your katana?

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:26.219
Even though it's stronger
than regular swords,

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:28.179
there's still a chance
it could break.

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.223
Haven't you heard
the old saying?

00:06:30.265 --> 00:06:33.852
It goes, "If you ever lose your
weapon on the battlefield,

00:06:33.894 --> 00:06:35.478
you're sure to lose your life."

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.063
[CECILY gasps]

00:06:41.985 --> 00:06:45.155
He knows he'll be fine if he
dodges the demon's attacks.

00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:49.159
He's staring into the face of
death, yet he has no fear.

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:50.660
That's rule number one.

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.997
A person wielding a katana
must have no fear.

00:06:55.498 --> 00:06:57.918
[LISA]
Don't worry, he'll be fine.

00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.295
It may look like he's in
a tough spot right now,

00:07:00.337 --> 00:07:02.672
but Luke knows he needs
to keep his distance.

00:07:02.714 --> 00:07:05.008
He'll strike when
he sees an opening.

00:07:14.476 --> 00:07:15.477
[LUKE grunts]

00:07:16.269 --> 00:07:18.355
[LUKE yells]

00:07:36.623 --> 00:07:38.792
He did it!

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.251
Hmph.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:48.051
Wow, Luke.

00:07:48.093 --> 00:07:51.137
Seeing you and your katana
in action was amazing!

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.849
That demon was solid ice and
you sliced right through it!

00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:57.936
I mean, I saw the whole thing
with my own eyes, but I--

00:07:57.978 --> 00:07:59.396
[gasps]

00:08:06.861 --> 00:08:08.363
[CECILY]
Where did it go?

00:08:08.405 --> 00:08:12.075
Yeah, that kinda just
happens. You're welcome.

00:08:12.117 --> 00:08:14.619
Damn thing almost
got the best of me.

00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:16.121
Seriously, you're
gonna owe me big

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:18.623
for helpin' you out like this.

00:08:18.665 --> 00:08:20.166
So, your "precious cargo"

00:08:20.208 --> 00:08:23.294
better be worth the
beating I just took.

00:08:23.336 --> 00:08:25.505
Don't worry, I'll make
sure you're well paid.

00:08:25.547 --> 00:08:27.048
I'm sure the Knight Guards
will be happy

00:08:27.090 --> 00:08:29.426
to reward you for
protecting their cargo.

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:32.262
Just leave it to me.
I'll talk to the captain myself

00:08:32.303 --> 00:08:34.597
and tell him that
you're the one who was--

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:35.515
[LUKE]
Huh?

00:08:35.557 --> 00:08:36.725
[LISA]
Uh-oh.

00:08:39.978 --> 00:08:40.854
[CECILY]
Hm?

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:43.231
[LUKE gasping]

00:08:43.273 --> 00:08:45.275
[gasping]

00:08:53.116 --> 00:08:56.870
--[thwack]
--[LUKE screams]

00:09:02.375 --> 00:09:05.462
So I owe you big time for
what you did yesterday.

00:09:05.503 --> 00:09:07.380
Thank you, Luke.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:12.844
Not only did those bandits try
to steal from the Knight Guards

00:09:12.886 --> 00:09:15.096
but they also signed
a Demon Contract!

00:09:15.138 --> 00:09:16.765
Call me crazy, but I
don't think those guys

00:09:16.806 --> 00:09:18.808
were smart enough to think
up that plan on their own.

00:09:18.850 --> 00:09:20.727
They must have had
someone calling the shots,

00:09:20.769 --> 00:09:23.146
telling them what to
do the entire time.

00:09:23.188 --> 00:09:24.939
I've discussed this with
the other Knight Guards

00:09:24.981 --> 00:09:26.357
and they all agree with me.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.901
There's gotta be
more to this case

00:09:27.942 --> 00:09:29.527
than meets the eye!

00:09:31.654 --> 00:09:34.032
So we've decided
that we're gonna do

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:37.577
some investigating,
and well, you see--

00:09:37.619 --> 00:09:39.412
Ah-hem...

00:09:39.454 --> 00:09:43.291
I'm sorry I lost my cool.
Please don't be mad at me.

00:09:43.333 --> 00:09:46.044
[LUKE]
What kind of apology is that?

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.838
You have a wardrobe malfunction
and all of a sudden you decide

00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:50.548
to beat the crap outta me?

00:09:50.590 --> 00:09:53.259
So sorry. Please
forgive me, Luke.

00:09:53.301 --> 00:09:54.928
Now, now, calm down.

00:09:54.969 --> 00:09:56.971
You should just accept
Miss Cecily's apology

00:09:57.013 --> 00:09:58.056
and we can all move on.

00:09:58.098 --> 00:09:58.973
[LUKE]
Look at my face!

00:09:59.015 --> 00:10:00.767
If she weren't a girl,
I'd kick her ass!

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:02.185
Hey, Luke, was that
the first time

00:10:02.227 --> 00:10:03.937
you've seen a lady's boobies?

00:10:03.978 --> 00:10:05.438
[LUKE]
You want me to throw you out?

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.776
[gasps] Well, I gotta say...

00:10:09.818 --> 00:10:12.612
Those are some gigantic boobs!

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:13.571
[BOTH gasp]

00:10:13.613 --> 00:10:16.783
[CECILY] Uh, could we please
change the subject?

00:10:16.825 --> 00:10:19.244
Uh-oh. It's almost time
for today's meeting!

00:10:19.285 --> 00:10:20.245
I'm not going.

00:10:20.286 --> 00:10:23.498
But Luke. You have to, you
already missed yesterday's!

00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:24.707
If you've got an
important meeting,

00:10:24.749 --> 00:10:26.126
you really should go.

00:10:26.167 --> 00:10:29.254
I'm not going anywhere--
look at my face!

00:10:42.559 --> 00:10:44.269
[ARTHUR]
Well, well Housman.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.020
It appears the
blacksmith is skipping

00:10:46.062 --> 00:10:47.730
our meeting once again.

00:10:47.772 --> 00:10:51.651
I told him I would very much
appreciate his presence today.

00:10:51.693 --> 00:10:55.196
But I know Mr. Ainsworth
is a busy young man.

00:10:55.238 --> 00:10:57.198
I can't think of
anything more important

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.075
than this meeting about
Valbanill.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.244
[AREVIY] I find it hard to
believe he can't find an hour

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:04.831
in his schedule to meet with
foreign diplomats, Housman.

00:11:04.873 --> 00:11:06.666
We can proceed without him.

00:11:06.708 --> 00:11:10.044
[ARTHUR] Then as our first order
of business, I propose we hold

00:11:10.086 --> 00:11:12.922
a vote to relocate our future
meetings to someplace

00:11:12.964 --> 00:11:15.508
other than the
Independent Trade Cities.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.218
[HOUSMAN] And what is
your reasoning, sir?

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.095
I'm not sure it's safe.

00:11:19.137 --> 00:11:21.181
Not in light of the
demon attack outside

00:11:21.222 --> 00:11:22.849
the gates of the city yesterday.

00:11:22.891 --> 00:11:23.766
[gasps]

00:11:23.808 --> 00:11:25.143
A demon attack?

00:11:25.185 --> 00:11:26.603
Is that true, Housman?

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:29.606
You witnessed it.
Didn't you, Siegfried?

00:11:29.647 --> 00:11:32.025
Yes sir, with my own eyes.

00:11:32.066 --> 00:11:33.359
[AREVIY]
I certainly wasn't expecting

00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.570
to hear news like this.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:37.363
What became of the demon?

00:11:37.405 --> 00:11:39.616
[HOUSMAN]
It has been disposed of.

00:11:39.657 --> 00:11:42.452
Really? How were you
able to defeat it?

00:11:42.493 --> 00:11:45.038
They're incredibly dangerous.

00:11:46.206 --> 00:11:49.209
[LANCELOT] I see.
This isn't the time to start

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:52.045
keeping secrets from
one another, Housman.

00:11:52.086 --> 00:11:53.922
[AREVIY laughs]
I don't blame him.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.466
I'm sure we all have
our little secrets.

00:11:56.507 --> 00:11:59.844
I thought we'd seen the last
of the Demon Contracts.

00:11:59.886 --> 00:12:01.846
It's been 44 long years

00:12:01.888 --> 00:12:05.225
since the Valbanill War
came to an end.

00:12:05.266 --> 00:12:07.143
[AREVIY] You don't suppose
this could be a sign

00:12:07.185 --> 00:12:09.646
he's preparing to return?

00:12:09.687 --> 00:12:11.522
[HOUSMAN] I'm afraid we
have no way of knowing.

00:12:11.564 --> 00:12:14.817
There's only one thing
we can be absolutely sure of.

00:12:14.859 --> 00:12:17.570
If Valbanill does return,

00:12:17.612 --> 00:12:20.865
the entire human race
will be doomed.

00:12:26.829 --> 00:12:28.206
[HOUSMAN] I've commissioned
a Sacred Sword

00:12:28.248 --> 00:12:30.875
from the blacksmith to
keep our nations safe.

00:12:30.917 --> 00:12:32.502
[AREVIY]
I just worry it won't be enough

00:12:32.543 --> 00:12:35.255
to protect us from
Valbanill's wrath.

00:12:35.296 --> 00:12:38.383
I don't think we should put
all our faith in a single sword.

00:12:38.424 --> 00:12:41.010
What if Valbanill returns
before we have it?

00:12:41.052 --> 00:12:42.971
The fate of the world
is in our hands

00:12:43.012 --> 00:12:45.098
and the odds are
stacked against us.

00:12:45.139 --> 00:12:46.557
[door creaks]

00:12:48.268 --> 00:12:50.728
I'm sorry to have kept
you gentlemen waiting.

00:12:56.734 --> 00:12:58.653
I see we're missing
someone again.

00:12:58.695 --> 00:13:01.155
I'm afraid we don't have
the luxury of waiting.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.575
We'll commence the Valbanill
meeting without the blacksmith.

00:13:11.708 --> 00:13:13.167
[KNIGHT GUARD 1]
We've confirmed 12 dead,

00:13:13.209 --> 00:13:15.211
and three men
critically injured.

00:13:15.253 --> 00:13:16.504
Twelve deaths?

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:19.882
I can't believe one demon
could cause so much destruction.

00:13:19.924 --> 00:13:21.134
From the reports I gathered,

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:24.220
they all died valiantly
protecting the cargo, sir.

00:13:24.262 --> 00:13:27.473
[HANNIBAL] I don't doubt that.
They were all very brave men.

00:13:27.515 --> 00:13:28.933
But even the most
courageous knight

00:13:28.975 --> 00:13:31.352
is still fearful
of his own death.

00:13:31.394 --> 00:13:33.021
I'd question anyone who wasn't.

00:13:33.062 --> 00:13:35.565
In fact, the Valbanill War
was caused by a man

00:13:35.606 --> 00:13:37.358
who laughed in
the face of death.

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.360
[REGINALD]
Captain Hannibal!

00:13:39.402 --> 00:13:41.821
We've found a
surviving bandit, sir!

00:13:42.864 --> 00:13:44.490
[REGINALD] He says they
drugged the monsters,

00:13:44.532 --> 00:13:47.452
that's how they were
able to control them.

00:13:47.493 --> 00:13:49.871
[HANNIBAL] You drugged them?
Who supplied you?

00:13:49.912 --> 00:13:51.664
[BANDIT]
I dunno. I didn't know the guy!

00:13:51.706 --> 00:13:54.959
I don't think you're
telling the truth.

00:13:54.959 --> 00:13:57.920
No, sir, I swear! I didn't
get a look at his face.

00:13:57.962 --> 00:14:00.506
He was dressed all in black,
some sorta hooded cloak.

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:02.633
He never told anyone his name!

00:14:02.675 --> 00:14:05.178
He-- He said he'd pay big
money if we just attack

00:14:05.219 --> 00:14:08.473
the Knight Guards and
bring back their cargo!

00:14:08.514 --> 00:14:10.099
And did this "man in black"

00:14:10.141 --> 00:14:12.643
happen to mention the
contents of that cargo?

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.519
[BANDIT]
No, sir.

00:14:13.561 --> 00:14:16.272
He just told us it was
some kind of treasure.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:18.149
Have you been able
to locate him?

00:14:18.191 --> 00:14:21.069
Sorry, sir. He must have
fled immediately after.

00:14:21.110 --> 00:14:22.403
He's on the loose.

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:23.446
That's not all!

00:14:23.488 --> 00:14:26.491
The man in black also turned our
boss into some kinda demon!

00:14:26.532 --> 00:14:29.619
[HANNIBAL] A demon?
You better not be lyin', boy!

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:31.079
No sir, it's the truth!

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:33.873
I swear, I saw it happen
with my own--

The man in black made their

00:14:52.683 --> 00:14:54.227
Curious.

00:14:54.268 --> 00:14:57.772

we need to find him.

[LISA grunts]

00:15:30.721 --> 00:15:31.973
That was amazing!

00:15:32.014 --> 00:15:34.934
Thank you for letting me watch
you forge that katana, Luke.

00:15:34.976 --> 00:15:37.437
That wasn't a katana,
it was a kitchen knife.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.479
Uh--

00:15:38.521 --> 00:15:41.441
And what you saw was just
the beginning of the process.

00:15:41.482 --> 00:15:43.693
There's still a million things
you have to do after that.

00:15:43.734 --> 00:15:46.946
You have to cool it, and
apply clay, shape the blade

00:15:46.988 --> 00:15:49.907
and the tip, then
sharpen and polish it.

00:15:49.949 --> 00:15:53.661
Apply clay? And shape the blade?

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:55.788
Let me put it to you
this way Cecily,

00:15:55.830 --> 00:15:57.331
to forge a katana you
have to go through

00:15:57.373 --> 00:15:59.667
many complicated
steps I doubt you'd ever

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.335
be able to fully understand.

00:16:01.377 --> 00:16:04.630
Yeah, thanks, because
clearly I'm an idiot!

00:16:04.672 --> 00:16:07.467
[LISA] Miss Cecily.
Sorry you had to watch from

00:16:07.508 --> 00:16:10.094
the doorway but we can't let
you in while we're working.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:11.429
Oh, don't worry about it.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:14.348
I'm just glad I got to see
part of the forging process.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.226
Yeah, I don't allow
women in the smithy.

00:16:17.268 --> 00:16:20.396
But what about Lisa?

00:16:20.438 --> 00:16:22.356
Lisa's a different story.

00:16:22.398 --> 00:16:23.608
What do you mean?

00:16:23.649 --> 00:16:25.735
I guess he lets me in
because he doesn't really

00:16:25.776 --> 00:16:27.487
think of me as a girl--
more like a buddy.

00:16:27.528 --> 00:16:28.488
Oh come on, that's ridiculous!

00:16:28.529 --> 00:16:30.573
She's just as much
of a woman as I am!

00:16:30.615 --> 00:16:33.242
I don't know about that.
I think your enormous boobs

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:35.244
make you much more
of a woman than me.

00:16:35.286 --> 00:16:37.538
Seriously? Could we stop
talking about them?

00:16:37.580 --> 00:16:39.874
Lisa is my assistant.

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:43.002
That's why she can come in.
I can't do it without her.

00:16:43.044 --> 00:16:45.505
Okay, I guess that
makes sense.

00:16:45.546 --> 00:16:47.465
You know, I was really
impressed by your whole

00:16:47.507 --> 00:16:49.926
"forging a katana" thing
in that last battle.

00:16:49.967 --> 00:16:53.012
Lisa. You looked like you
were possessed or something.

00:16:53.054 --> 00:16:54.430
So is that like,
something you picked up

00:16:54.472 --> 00:16:56.224
in blacksmithing school?

00:16:56.265 --> 00:16:57.975
I mean, it looked like
you forged that thing

00:16:58.017 --> 00:16:59.143
out of thin air!

[HOUSMAN]
"A man in black," you say?

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.300
[HANNIBAL]
My guess is he put a parasite

00:17:31.342 --> 00:17:33.553
in the bandits' drinks
to infect them.

00:17:33.594 --> 00:17:36.847
He made sure to dispose
of any possible witnesses.

00:17:36.889 --> 00:17:39.141
[HOUSMAN] So this "man in black"
made the bandits' leader

00:17:39.183 --> 00:17:41.602
sign a Demon Contract?

00:17:41.644 --> 00:17:44.146
[HANNIBAL] I was surprised
to hear it myself.

00:17:44.188 --> 00:17:45.231
[HOUSMAN]
That's troubling.

00:17:45.273 --> 00:17:47.108
Discovering the
identity of this man

00:17:47.149 --> 00:17:49.277
will have to be our
highest priority.

00:17:49.318 --> 00:17:52.154
[HANNIBAL] Oh, I'm sure he'll
make his way back into town.

And when he does,
we'll catch him.

Thank you Captain.

00:17:55.366 --> 00:17:57.243
Leave him to me.

You can worry about
protecting the sacred sword.

Under the circumstances,

00:18:07.211 --> 00:18:09.547

I hope you understand,

[sighs] I can't say I blame you.

00:18:14.594 --> 00:18:18.848
We let our guard down,
and it was nearly stolen.

efforts of Mister Ainsworth

00:18:20.641 --> 00:18:23.060

Yes, sir.

00:18:28.399 --> 00:18:31.027
So, where is the real sword?

00:18:31.068 --> 00:18:34.322
I had her walk into the city
on her own two legs.

00:18:34.363 --> 00:18:36.324
You can come in now.

I know you denied
my request before

00:18:49.378 --> 00:18:52.673
but I'm asking you
one more time.

00:18:52.715 --> 00:18:53.841
I'm begging you.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.844
You're the one person who
can forge a katana for me.

00:18:56.886 --> 00:19:00.389
Yes, I'm inexperienced,
and maybe I don't deserve one.

00:19:00.431 --> 00:19:04.894
But it is the only weapon worthy
of replacing my family sword.

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:08.439
Please, say that you'll
forge one for me, Luke.

I swear I'll use it to protect
the citizens of this city!

the same thing to me once.

Don't play dumb.

You didn't seriously think
you were gonna get

a katana out of me
for free, did you?

00:19:52.066 --> 00:19:54.652
You know how much work
it takes me to make one.

00:19:54.694 --> 00:19:57.863
[CECILY] Wha-- Of course
I was gonna pay you for it!

00:19:57.905 --> 00:19:58.864
All right then.

00:19:58.906 --> 00:20:01.075
I'll need some
tamahagane to forge it.

00:20:01.117 --> 00:20:03.703
It's a special kind of
steel I use for katana.

00:20:03.744 --> 00:20:05.079
You're gonna have
to go to the market

00:20:05.121 --> 00:20:06.497
and pick some up for me.

00:20:06.539 --> 00:20:08.624
I'll also need you to buy
some polishing stones,

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.751
the sheath, the hilt,
and then you'll have

00:20:10.793 --> 00:20:12.920
to pay me for the
construction of the blade.

00:20:12.962 --> 00:20:13.921
I'll cut you a discount,

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:15.506
but you're still looking
at a total of at least--

00:20:15.548 --> 00:20:18.050
Whoa. Now stop right
there, mister!

00:20:18.092 --> 00:20:19.552
That's soundin' kinda pricey.

Y-You do know I work for
the government, right?

00:20:21.762 --> 00:20:23.389
What little money I
make goes right back

into the Cambell house!

00:20:24.849 --> 00:20:26.809
I mean, I don't even
have any savings!

00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:28.352
Not my problem.

Do you think we could work out
some kind of payment plan?

Nope, payment in full.

00:20:32.314 --> 00:20:34.567
[CECILY] Um. Can I pay you
when you're finished with it?

00:20:34.608 --> 00:20:35.985
[LUKE]
Yeah, no. In advance.

00:20:36.026 --> 00:20:37.570
[CECILY]
I-- J-- Um...

00:20:37.611 --> 00:20:40.114
[LUKE] What's the matter,
Cecily? Can't afford it?

00:20:40.156 --> 00:20:44.702
Well, I guess this conversation
never happened then.

00:20:44.744 --> 00:20:47.872
[CECILY]
Why are you such a jerk?!

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:57.089
[KNIGHT GUARDS chattering]

00:21:05.306 --> 00:21:07.558
[CECILY] I can't believe him!
What is his problem?

00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:09.477
Uh! What's wrong, Cecily?

00:21:09.518 --> 00:21:10.770
I don't get him.

00:21:10.853 --> 00:21:13.230
He totally pulled one
over on me. Jerk.

00:21:13.272 --> 00:21:15.149
Oh. Fighting with
your boyfriend?

00:21:15.191 --> 00:21:17.860
[CECILY]
What boyfriend?

00:21:17.902 --> 00:21:18.944
I was a fool for
actually thinking

00:21:18.986 --> 00:21:21.405
--he'd do something nice for me!
--Excuse me, Cecily?

00:21:21.447 --> 00:21:23.407
Ah! Just thinking about
it make me wanna--

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.201
[HANNIBAL]
Knight Guard Cambell!

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:27.953
[gasps] Sir, yes sir!

00:21:27.995 --> 00:21:30.998
You have been selected
for a special mission.

00:21:31.999 --> 00:21:34.335
[CECILY] A valuable package
you need me to protect?

00:21:34.376 --> 00:21:37.379
It was part of the cargo
you saved from those bandits.

00:21:37.421 --> 00:21:39.048
I cannot stress
how important it is

00:21:39.089 --> 00:21:41.258
that you take
this job seriously.

00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:43.886
You must promise to keep
it safe at all costs.

00:21:43.928 --> 00:21:46.096
[CECILY] May I ask why you've
chosen me for the job?

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.140
Because you happen to
be one of the best knights

00:21:48.182 --> 00:21:51.644
we have on staff. And partly
because you're a woman.

00:21:51.685 --> 00:21:53.020
Huh?

00:21:55.147 --> 00:21:58.359
[HANNIBAL]
Quasar reporting.

00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.610
Yes, enter.

00:21:59.652 --> 00:22:01.028
[door creaks]

00:22:02.947 --> 00:22:05.658
I've brought Miss Cambell
for you, sir.

00:22:05.699 --> 00:22:06.826
Hello, Miss Cambell.

00:22:06.867 --> 00:22:08.869
Thank you for
accepting this mission.

00:22:08.911 --> 00:22:10.621
I truly appreciate it.

00:22:10.663 --> 00:22:13.374
[gasps] Yes, sir.

00:22:13.415 --> 00:22:17.086
[ARIA] Hello. I must say,
it's an honor to be protected

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:19.213
by such a beautiful young woman.

00:22:19.255 --> 00:22:20.923
[CECILY]
Uh...?

00:22:20.965 --> 00:22:25.177
Let me introduce myself.
My name is Aria.
