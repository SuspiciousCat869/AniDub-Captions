[CECILY gasping]

00:00:25.192 --> 00:00:28.487
[CECILY]
What is that thing? A demon?

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.032
[DEMON growls]

00:00:32.074 --> 00:00:34.868
You can do this.
Don't chicken out.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:38.539
It's my duty as the head of
the prestigious Cambell house.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.040
I'm a member of
the Knight Guards

00:00:40.082 --> 00:00:42.709
who protect the Independent
Trade Cities of Housman.

00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.796
I am... Cecily Cambell!

00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.839
[yelling]

00:01:14.116 --> 00:01:18.912
[CECILY] That's three times now
you've saved my life, Luke.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:04.226
[CITIZENS chattering]

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.563
Come get'cher vegetables!
Everything's 30% off!

00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:11.191
Look no further, ladies and
gents! I've got...

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.902
[CUSTOMER]
You can't be serious.

00:03:13.944 --> 00:03:15.237
[STEEL VENDOR]
I'm sorry, sir,

00:03:15.278 --> 00:03:17.197
but our trade rate for
tamahagane was set back

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:19.199
at the beginning of the year.
Take it or leave it.

00:03:19.241 --> 00:03:21.201
C'mon, can't you
make an exception?

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:22.703
I'm afraid not.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.955
Are you sure? I have
friends who happen to be

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:27.207
high-ranking officials
within the Empire.

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.668
I'd hate to have to
tell them about you.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.130
[STEEL VENDOR] Hmph. Housman is
an independent trade city, sir.

00:03:33.171 --> 00:03:34.631
The Empire and
the Garrison State

00:03:34.673 --> 00:03:35.757
mean nothing here.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.552
If you want to buy it then
buy it. If not, just go home.

00:03:38.593 --> 00:03:39.428
[CUSTOMER]
How dare you?!

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.304
You're nothing but
a small-town trader!

00:03:41.346 --> 00:03:43.473
If the Empire ever got wind
of what you're doing here--

00:03:43.515 --> 00:03:46.977
[CECILY] That's enough! Take
your hands off of him right now.

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:47.978
[STEEL VENDOR grunts]

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:49.688
What do you want, little girl?

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.772
[gasps]

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:55.110
No way. You're a member
of the Knight Guards?

00:03:55.152 --> 00:03:56.027
It's common knowledge

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:58.280
that Housman controls
the tamahagane market

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.365
and can therefore
set its own prices.

00:04:00.407 --> 00:04:03.994
Even the Empire is
aware of that fact, sir.

00:04:04.035 --> 00:04:06.830
If you still want to haggle,
then I will take matters

00:04:06.872 --> 00:04:08.331
into my own hands.

00:04:08.373 --> 00:04:12.627
Shall I introduce you to
the Cambell family sword?

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.212
I'll be back!

00:04:16.882 --> 00:04:18.049
[sighs]

00:04:18.091 --> 00:04:19.134
[CITIZENS cheer]

00:04:19.176 --> 00:04:20.051
[MAN 1]
Nice, kiddo!

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.803
[WOMAN 2]
You really stood up to him!

00:04:21.845 --> 00:04:23.680
[STEEL VENDOR] We can't
thank you enough, Cecily.

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:25.766
[FISH VENDOR] Yeah.
That was truly impressive.

00:04:25.807 --> 00:04:28.143
[VEGETABLE VENDOR] I remember
when you were just knee-high.

00:04:28.185 --> 00:04:31.730
But now you've grown
so much bigger!

00:04:31.772 --> 00:04:35.108
Hey! You wanna sleep in
the barn for the next week?

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.943
[CITIZENS laughing]

00:04:36.985 --> 00:04:39.905
[JACK yells]

00:04:39.946 --> 00:04:41.573
What now?

00:04:45.035 --> 00:04:48.079
[yelling]

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:51.249
[VOICE 1]
What's with that guy?

00:04:51.291 --> 00:04:52.292
[VOICE 2]
I don't know!

00:04:52.334 --> 00:04:54.711
[VOICE 3] He just went
crazy all of a sudden!

00:04:54.753 --> 00:04:56.004
[VOICE 4]
Hey, look at his armor!

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:58.965
It's pretty ragged,
but it doesn't look cheap!

00:04:59.007 --> 00:05:00.050
[VOICE 5]
You're right!

00:05:00.091 --> 00:05:03.094
It looks like he used to be
the leader of an arms group!

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:05.972
Stop this!

00:05:06.014 --> 00:05:09.309
I won't allow you to
disgrace a knight's sword!

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:11.770
A true knight swings his
sword to protect people,

00:05:11.812 --> 00:05:12.979
not frighten them!

00:05:13.021 --> 00:05:15.065
I'm a member of the
Knight Guards who protect

00:05:15.106 --> 00:05:17.400
the Independent Trade
Cities of Housman.

00:05:17.442 --> 00:05:19.152
My name is Cecily Cambell.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:21.613
I order you to disarm
and leave this place!

00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.783
[MAN yelling, grunting]

00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:30.038
Didn't you hear what I said?
Disarm and leave immediately!

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:31.581
[CITIZENS gasping]

00:05:31.623 --> 00:05:35.043
[MAN yells]

00:05:36.336 --> 00:05:38.088
[CECILY]
If you do not follow my orders,

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:41.925
I'll have to resort to violence!

00:05:41.967 --> 00:05:43.385
Where is it?

00:05:43.426 --> 00:05:47.347
I've waited so long.
Where is my salvation?

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:50.350
[gasps] Salvation?

00:05:50.392 --> 00:05:51.393
[yells]

00:05:51.434 --> 00:05:53.061
[CECILY grunting]

00:05:58.483 --> 00:06:02.612
[CECILY] I don't know how much
more of this I can take.

00:06:09.911 --> 00:06:12.789
I gave them everything I had.

00:06:12.831 --> 00:06:16.793
My mind, body, and soul
for a chance to fight.

00:06:16.835 --> 00:06:19.421
But it was all for nothing!

00:06:19.462 --> 00:06:21.298
[CECILY] Don't let him
get to you, Cecily.

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:26.303
Don't be afraid, just stay
strong. This is your duty.

00:06:26.344 --> 00:06:29.639
I will protect the
people of Housman!

00:06:29.681 --> 00:06:32.809
[yelling]

00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:35.478
[CECILY gasps]

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:43.862
They promised...
They promised me salvation.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:46.489
[CECILY]
The Cambell family sword.

00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:50.243
What'll I do now? He'll kill me.

00:06:51.244 --> 00:06:53.914
Where is it?!

00:06:53.955 --> 00:06:55.415
[CECILY gasps]

00:07:10.847 --> 00:07:14.392
[gasping]

00:07:15.393 --> 00:07:16.895
I noticed your arm.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.898
You must be a veteran
of the Valbanill War.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.609
[CECILY] Amazing...
He sliced right through it!

00:07:22.651 --> 00:07:23.652
[CITIZENS murmuring]

00:07:23.693 --> 00:07:26.363
[CECILY] I've never seen
a sword like that.

00:07:26.404 --> 00:07:32.702
[CITIZENS murmuring]

00:07:35.872 --> 00:07:38.875
Thanks for saving me.
I'm one of the Knight Guards--

00:07:38.917 --> 00:07:42.545
[gasps]

00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:44.589
Ow. That hurt.

00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:48.510
[LUKE] Hmph. You're a sorry
excuse for a knight.

00:07:48.551 --> 00:07:54.391
[CECILY] What did you say?
Hey. You don't even know me--

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:57.143
[LISA]
Luke! Don't leave without me!

00:07:59.312 --> 00:08:02.148
I'm glad we ran into you,
that was a close call.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.526
Jeez, why's he in such a
hurry to get out of here?

00:08:04.567 --> 00:08:07.195
Luke! Wait up!

00:08:07.237 --> 00:08:08.947
Luke...

00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:15.120
[LISA] You certainly don't see
female knights very often.

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:17.622
She's no knight.
She's totally incompetent.

00:08:17.664 --> 00:08:20.500
But did you see the way
she stood up him?

00:08:20.542 --> 00:08:22.794
All she did was
make things worse.

00:08:22.836 --> 00:08:25.588
Well, I thought she was
courageous and real pretty!

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:27.757
I didn't get a good
look at her face.

00:08:27.799 --> 00:08:29.551
All I noticed was
the way she was

00:08:29.592 --> 00:08:32.470
swinging around
that joke of a sword.

00:08:32.512 --> 00:08:34.389
Trust me, she was pretty.

00:08:34.431 --> 00:08:36.182
The only reason her
sword looked funny

00:08:36.224 --> 00:08:37.559
is 'cause it was broken.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:39.185
[LUKE]
She's better off without one.

00:08:39.227 --> 00:08:41.146
She should quit
while she still can.

00:08:41.187 --> 00:08:42.897
[LISA]
Give the girl a break.

00:08:42.939 --> 00:08:45.900
Where do you think you're going?
We have a meeting today!

00:08:45.942 --> 00:08:48.570
I don't feel like going
anymore. I'm heading home.

00:08:48.611 --> 00:08:50.030
You're skipping again?

00:08:50.071 --> 00:08:52.449
Don't you think
they're gonna be mad?

00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:54.659
They're expecting you!

00:08:56.036 --> 00:08:58.413
[BLACKSMITH] These days we
use molds to make swords.

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:01.750
It's more efficient. So we
don't really do repairs.

00:09:01.791 --> 00:09:03.460
I'm afraid the only
thing we could do

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:06.838
is melt down your old sword
and completely re-forge it.

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.758
If you did that, it wouldn't
be the same sword anymore.

00:09:09.799 --> 00:09:11.342
This sword has been passed down

00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:14.095
the Cambell family
for generations.

00:09:14.137 --> 00:09:16.306
Well, I'm sorry
but we can't help.

00:09:16.347 --> 00:09:18.349
Back in the old days
there were blacksmiths

00:09:18.391 --> 00:09:20.393
who could repair
a sword like yours.

00:09:20.435 --> 00:09:22.771
But it'd be nearly impossible
to find someone

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:25.023
who could do that now.

00:09:25.065 --> 00:09:26.775
You know, this blacksmith shop

00:09:26.816 --> 00:09:28.693
forges all of the
Knight Guard's swords.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:31.112
Since you're a member, we could
always order you a new one.

00:09:31.154 --> 00:09:34.032
Best of all, it would be free!

00:09:34.074 --> 00:09:35.867
I appreciate it, Patty.

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:38.328
But I could never wield
a different sword.

00:09:38.369 --> 00:09:40.413
[PATTY]
I understand.

00:09:40.455 --> 00:09:42.415
Look, I know it holds
sentimental value,

00:09:42.457 --> 00:09:43.958
but it's incredibly old.

00:09:43.958 --> 00:09:45.752
Even if you found
someone who could fix it,

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.213
it would still be
totally useless in battle.

00:09:48.254 --> 00:09:50.882
That may be,
but I can't give up on it.

00:09:50.924 --> 00:09:54.219
No other sword could
protect me like this one.

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.392
Except his.

00:10:01.434 --> 00:10:04.229
Sir, do you happen to know
a young man named Luke?

00:10:04.270 --> 00:10:06.773
Luke? Sure do.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.285
[CECILY]
"You'll find his cottage

00:10:19.327 --> 00:10:21.412
on the outskirts
of the 7th city.

00:10:21.454 --> 00:10:27.210
It's near the river just
before you get to the forest."

00:10:27.252 --> 00:10:31.005
This has gotta be the place.

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.715
Lisa?

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:33.591
[LUKE]
Lisa.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:35.093
Yeah, what is it, Luke?

00:10:35.135 --> 00:10:36.261
[LUKE]
Could you make us some tea?

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.762
I'm just about done.

00:10:37.804 --> 00:10:41.641
Sure, no problem. Oh...

00:10:41.683 --> 00:10:44.018
What's the matter,
everything okay?

00:10:44.060 --> 00:10:46.229
You again.

00:10:46.271 --> 00:10:48.731
Uh. Hey.

00:11:00.994 --> 00:11:04.414
Ah-hem. I'm one of the
Knight Guards who protect

00:11:04.455 --> 00:11:06.791
the Independent Trade
Cities of Housman.

00:11:06.833 --> 00:11:08.918
My name is Cecily Cambell.

00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:11.296
I want to thank you
for saving my life.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:12.172
I owe you one.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:15.383
Yeah, great.
My name's Luke Ainsworth.

00:11:21.472 --> 00:11:23.099
It's nice to meet you.

00:11:23.141 --> 00:11:24.684
What'd you do that for?

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.603
"A proper greeting
is quintessential

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.521
to a fledgling relationship."

00:11:28.563 --> 00:11:32.358
That's something my father
always used to say.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.027
What the hell's
wrong with you, lady?

00:11:34.068 --> 00:11:37.030

Are you kids ready for tea?

00:11:37.071 --> 00:11:39.949

You friends yet?

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.034
We're gettin' there.

Oh, please, it's just Cecily.

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:50.084
Oh. Miss Cecily.

00:11:50.126 --> 00:11:51.753
Your name is Lisa, right?

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:54.005
I noticed your name
on the sign outside.

00:11:54.047 --> 00:11:56.424
Yeah, that's just a coincidence.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:59.427
Oh. Sorry, did I hit a nerve?

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:01.346
So's there a reason
you're still here?

00:12:01.387 --> 00:12:03.681
I was hoping you might
forge me a sword.

00:12:03.723 --> 00:12:04.682
You what?

00:12:04.724 --> 00:12:08.436
A sharp one. Exactly
like the one you carry.

00:12:08.478 --> 00:12:12.941
You know, one strong enough
to slice through other swords.

00:12:12.982 --> 00:12:16.945
I'm sorry, we don't take
commissions for swords.

00:12:16.986 --> 00:12:19.948
We stopped making them.
The day my father died?

00:12:19.989 --> 00:12:22.617
He's who forged that
one you're lookin' at.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:25.870
Wow. So, did he also make
the one you've been using?

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:27.830
No, Luke forged that
sword all by himself--

00:12:27.872 --> 00:12:30.375
[LUKE]
Lisa!

00:12:30.416 --> 00:12:33.419
If you made it by yourself, you
should be proud of your work.

00:12:33.461 --> 00:12:36.422
It's the most amazing
sword I've ever seen.

00:12:36.464 --> 00:12:38.132
It's strong and beautiful.

00:12:38.174 --> 00:12:39.509
I was so impressed.

00:12:39.550 --> 00:12:42.387
I decided I had to
have one for myself.

00:12:42.428 --> 00:12:43.429
Not gonna happen.

00:12:43.471 --> 00:12:46.641
I only forge katana
for my own personal use.

00:12:46.683 --> 00:12:49.102
Katana? Is that
what they're called?

00:12:49.143 --> 00:12:52.355
I made that decision
when I was a kid.

00:12:52.397 --> 00:12:55.817
Now please leave.

00:12:55.858 --> 00:12:57.235
[LISA sighs]

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.490
[gasps]

00:13:02.532 --> 00:13:04.826
This is my sword.
It's not much, but it's been

00:13:04.867 --> 00:13:09.122
in the Cambell family
for generations.

00:13:09.163 --> 00:13:10.832
You know I'm a member
of the Knight Guards

00:13:10.873 --> 00:13:12.875
but here's something
you don't know.

00:13:12.917 --> 00:13:16.796
I've only been a knight
for about a month.

00:13:16.838 --> 00:13:20.091
Ever since the Valbanill War,
the head of the Cambell family

00:13:20.133 --> 00:13:21.843
has joined the knighthood.

00:13:21.884 --> 00:13:24.387
My father and my
grandfather before him

00:13:24.429 --> 00:13:27.724
helped found and protect
the Independent Trade Cities.

00:13:27.765 --> 00:13:29.309
They were considered
the right-hand men

00:13:29.350 --> 00:13:31.602
of Housman the first.

00:13:31.644 --> 00:13:34.897
A month ago, my father
died of a serious illness.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:38.067
As his only child, it was
my duty to succeed my father

00:13:38.109 --> 00:13:40.236
as the head of
the Cambell family.

00:13:40.278 --> 00:13:42.322
As such, I knew I had
to join the knighthood

00:13:42.363 --> 00:13:46.993
and become a member
of the Knight Guards.

00:13:47.035 --> 00:13:50.830
But I was almost killed by that
crazy man in my first battle.

00:13:50.872 --> 00:13:53.374
I lost what little
confidence I had.

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.209
Now I'm scared.

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:58.004
So at this point, the only
thing that keeps me going

00:13:58.046 --> 00:14:00.715
is the strength I gather
from my family sword.

00:14:00.757 --> 00:14:02.216
But now that it's
been destroyed,

00:14:02.258 --> 00:14:05.136
I can't depend on it anymore.

00:14:05.178 --> 00:14:07.680
I need a new sword
I can depend on!

00:14:07.722 --> 00:14:10.475
I want a strong one that won't
break when I need it most.

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:12.268
One that will help me
protect this city

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:14.187
and give me confidence
as a knight.

00:14:14.228 --> 00:14:18.483
I want a sword that will act
as my partner in a battle.

00:14:18.524 --> 00:14:20.234
Only you can do that, Luke.

00:14:20.276 --> 00:14:22.362
You can forge me a sword
that won't fall apart,

00:14:22.403 --> 00:14:25.031
made especially for me!

00:14:29.035 --> 00:14:30.620
I'm sorry, Miss Cecily.

00:14:30.661 --> 00:14:31.788
I hate to break it to you,

00:14:31.829 --> 00:14:34.624
but there's no such thing
as an indestructible sword.

00:14:34.665 --> 00:14:37.043
No matter how durably
it's forged every sword

00:14:37.085 --> 00:14:38.836
starts to break down eventually.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:40.254
Even Luke's katana don't last--

00:14:40.296 --> 00:14:41.172
That's enough, Lisa.

00:14:41.214 --> 00:14:43.883
I think you've done
enough damage for today.

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.884
Luke?

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.177
Are you done now?

00:14:46.219 --> 00:14:48.888
One more thing: I want
you to look at me.

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.391

within my breast.

That's certainly one way
to call attention to them.

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:01.317
No, you've got it all wrong!

00:15:01.359 --> 00:15:03.069
Luke is the biggest

00:15:03.111 --> 00:15:05.488
I'd never be interested in him!

00:15:05.530 --> 00:15:06.989
The feeling's mutual.
