That's quite a threat,
young lady.

00:19:21.702 --> 00:19:23.579
I do hope you're
able to back it up.

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:25.790
Though I doubt you're
strong enough to hurt me.

00:19:25.831 --> 00:19:27.291
You're full of hot air.

00:19:27.333 --> 00:19:29.794
All your talk of love and
protecting the people

00:19:29.835 --> 00:19:33.005
you care for is enough to
make anyone nauseous.

00:19:33.047 --> 00:19:35.174
I only wish Valbanill
would come down

00:19:35.216 --> 00:19:37.343
and kill each of you himself.

00:19:37.385 --> 00:19:38.594
I'm not afraid of him.

00:19:38.636 --> 00:19:41.055
I'd love a chance to
make him pay too!

00:19:41.097 --> 00:19:43.015
I hereby swear!

00:19:43.057 --> 00:19:44.642
Someday, I'll fight him!

00:19:44.684 --> 00:19:47.436
I'll defeat him with
this katana Luke made!

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:49.146
[SIEGFRIED laughs]

00:19:49.188 --> 00:19:51.107
[SIEGFRIED] You could have
the best katana ever forged,

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:53.067
and it wouldn't do you any good.

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:55.486
A sword is only as
strong as its wielder.

00:19:55.528 --> 00:19:58.239
[CECILY] Technique's not as
important as you might think!

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.533
What matters is having a
heart that never yields!

00:20:00.574 --> 00:20:02.993
[SIEGFRIED] Shut your mouth,
you obnoxious brat!

00:20:03.035 --> 00:20:05.746
If you think it's so easy,
then come and get me.

00:20:05.788 --> 00:20:08.999
All it will take is one blow and
both your sword and your soul

00:20:09.041 --> 00:20:10.835
will be obliterated!

00:20:18.592 --> 00:20:20.052
[gasps]

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:25.725
[grunts]

00:20:25.766 --> 00:20:28.978
[SIEGFRIED, CECILY shout]

00:20:35.985 --> 00:20:37.194
[gasps]

00:20:38.446 --> 00:20:41.741
[CECILY shouts]

00:20:41.782 --> 00:20:43.784
[SIEGFRIED groans]

00:20:43.826 --> 00:20:45.202
[CECILY, LISA, LUKE gasp]

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:55.087
You stabbed me!

00:20:55.129 --> 00:20:59.091
I will have my revenge
one day, I swear.

00:21:02.178 --> 00:21:05.890
Cecily Cambell. Luke Ainsworth.

00:21:07.850 --> 00:21:10.060
[CECILY, LUKE, LISA gasp]]

00:21:18.194 --> 00:21:19.987
[CECILY]
Thank you, Luke.

00:21:20.029 --> 00:21:22.823
[LUKE] For what?
That katana was a total failure.

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.617
[CECILY]
That's not entirely true.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.118
I mean, if it wasn't
for this sword,

00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:28.913
I wouldn't have had the
confidence to face Siegfried.

00:21:28.954 --> 00:21:30.289
[LUKE gasps]

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:33.542
I felt completely safe
while wielding your katana.

00:21:33.584 --> 00:21:37.046
It's the reason
I'm alive right now.

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:38.297
[gasps]

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:42.051
[LISA gasps]

00:21:42.092 --> 00:21:43.260
I think you're just lucky.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.930
I know you try to be modest,
but you gotta admit.

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:48.265
You're good at what you do.

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:49.892
And I believe in you.

00:21:49.934 --> 00:21:52.520
I mean, you are the
Sacred Blacksmith.

00:21:54.104 --> 00:21:56.065
I don't know about that.

00:21:56.106 --> 00:21:58.901
But you sure know how to
talk a guy out of a funk.

00:21:58.943 --> 00:22:01.612
[CECILY]
Mm. C'mon, let's go.

00:22:01.654 --> 00:22:02.822
Our work here isn't done.

00:22:02.863 --> 00:22:05.533
There're still people in
town who need our help.

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:07.409
[LUKE] Wait. You want
to keep fighting?

00:22:07.451 --> 00:22:09.203
[CECILY]
Of course, that's my job.

00:22:09.245 --> 00:22:11.163
Gotta keep the people safe.

00:22:12.957 --> 00:22:14.458
[LUKE]
Hm.
