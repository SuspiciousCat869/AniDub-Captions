WEBVTT

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.404
I'm so sorry. Goodbye, Elsa.

00:00:29.446 --> 00:00:32.324
Don't be sad for her, this is
how she wanted it to end.

00:00:32.366 --> 00:00:34.159
She's happy.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:37.704
She's finally with her father.
Now they'll be together forever.

00:00:37.746 --> 00:00:39.706
I didn't think
about it that way.

00:00:44.753 --> 00:00:46.421
[LISA gasps]
Almost forgot.

00:00:46.463 --> 00:00:49.716
I was going to ask if you two
wanna come over for lunch.

00:00:49.758 --> 00:00:52.386
And... we can eat inside
'cause we fixed the roof!

00:00:52.427 --> 00:00:54.930
[ARIA gasps] That was fast!
It's only been 2 days.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:58.433
Our neighbors felt bad for us,
so they came over and helped.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:00:59.935
Sorry Lisa, I can't.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:04.064
I've gotta work security for
a meeting this afternoon.

00:01:04.106 --> 00:01:06.650
[LISA]
Mm. 'Kay. I understand.

00:01:06.692 --> 00:01:10.028
[LUKE sighs]
Lisa. Let's go home.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.616
[LISA gasps] Coming!
I'll see you guys later.

00:01:14.658 --> 00:01:16.201
[CECILY]
Mm.

00:01:16.243 --> 00:01:17.411
[ARIA]
Mm?

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:55.217
[ARIA] Why'd you turn
down Lisa's invitation?

00:02:55.258 --> 00:02:56.635
[CECILY]
Like I said, I have to work.

00:02:56.677 --> 00:02:58.053
[ARIA] You didn't say
a word while we were

00:02:58.095 --> 00:03:01.473
paying our respects.
I've never seen you so quiet.

00:03:03.642 --> 00:03:04.559
[ARIA]
Uh?

00:03:04.601 --> 00:03:07.688
It's just... Luke brought
me here before.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.773
And I realized
something that day.

00:03:09.815 --> 00:03:12.859
Even though I want to know as
much about Luke as possible,

00:03:12.901 --> 00:03:15.320
learning his darkest
secrets could hurt me.

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:17.614
You warned me this
would happen, Aria.

00:03:17.656 --> 00:03:21.535
You said that once I knew,
I'd never be able to forget.

00:03:21.576 --> 00:03:22.953
I didn't listen.

00:03:22.994 --> 00:03:25.455
For some reason, I thought
things would go differently.

00:03:25.497 --> 00:03:29.334
That it'd be better to face the
problem rather than avoid it.

00:03:29.376 --> 00:03:30.419
But I was wrong.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.254
And now that I know.

00:03:32.295 --> 00:03:35.882
I can't even find the words
to be supportive of my friend.

00:03:38.051 --> 00:03:40.470
I'm sad they didn't
join us for lunch.

00:03:40.512 --> 00:03:42.806
You don't think it's
because I'm a, you know.

00:03:42.848 --> 00:03:45.392
Forget about it, I think it's
weird they started eating lunch

00:03:45.434 --> 00:03:47.561
here with us in the first place.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:51.106
--But Luke.
--[LUKE] Just let it go.

00:03:51.148 --> 00:03:52.357
[gasps]

00:04:07.414 --> 00:04:09.207
[sighs]

00:04:15.297 --> 00:04:16.798
Don't be upset, Lisa.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.593
Things have just gone back
to the way they were before.

00:04:19.634 --> 00:04:20.802
That's a good thing.

00:04:20.844 --> 00:04:23.805
You and I can continue to live
peacefully without any worries.

00:04:23.847 --> 00:04:26.141
[LISA] Things are never
as peaceful as they seem.

00:04:26.183 --> 00:04:27.559
[gasps]

00:04:32.105 --> 00:04:33.690
Lisa...

00:04:33.732 --> 00:04:35.108
[CECILY]
My father used to bring me here

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.402
all the time when I was a kid.

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.738
After he died, I'd come out
here whenever something

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.698
was troubling me.

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:45.494
It's funny, I stopped coming
here when I met Luke and Lisa.

00:04:45.535 --> 00:04:48.121
[ARIA] Were you surprised
to learn Lisa's a demon?

00:04:48.163 --> 00:04:50.123
[CECILY gasps]
Well, of course I was!

00:04:50.165 --> 00:04:52.626
I mean, weren't you
a little freaked out?

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.543
Not at all.

00:04:53.585 --> 00:04:55.962
I knew what she was from
the first moment I met her.

00:04:56.004 --> 00:04:56.838
[CECILY]
What?

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.424
You see, Cecily,
I'm a demon too.

00:04:59.466 --> 00:05:02.219
All Demon Swords are,
or didn't you realize that?

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:04.513
[CECILY gasps] It's just a
lot of information

00:05:04.554 --> 00:05:06.223
to take in all at once.

00:05:06.264 --> 00:05:09.643
To be honest with you, I don't
really know what to think.

00:05:09.684 --> 00:05:12.521
I'm so thoroughly confused.

00:05:12.562 --> 00:05:14.898
Damn it, I'm pathetic.

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.858
Now that you know
Lisa and I are demons,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.902
do you feel differently
about us?

00:05:18.944 --> 00:05:19.736
No!

00:05:19.778 --> 00:05:21.488
Things won't be weird
between us, will they?

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.115
I won't let that happen!
I don't care if you're demons!

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.534
You guys are still my friends!

00:05:25.575 --> 00:05:27.911
Well, then, there's nothing
to worry about.

00:05:27.953 --> 00:05:29.162
[gasps]

00:05:29.204 --> 00:05:31.414
Being a demon doesn't
change who we are.

00:05:31.456 --> 00:05:32.582
When it comes down to it,

00:05:32.624 --> 00:05:35.627
Lisa's no different now than
she was when you first met her.

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.546
[gasps]

00:05:37.587 --> 00:05:41.424
[LISA giggles]

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:44.094
[gasps]

00:05:44.135 --> 00:05:47.639
[CECILY] You're right! How could
I have been such an idiot?

00:05:47.681 --> 00:05:50.767
[shouts] This shouldn't
change how I feel about her.

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:52.853
She's a demon,
but she's still Lisa!

00:05:52.894 --> 00:05:55.605
[gasps]

00:05:55.647 --> 00:05:57.983
[CECILY grunts]
I'm sorry, Aria.

00:05:58.024 --> 00:06:01.111
Thanks, but I'm not the one
you should apologize to.

00:06:01.152 --> 00:06:02.487
Yeah, as soon as I'm off duty,

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:04.739
I'll go by and
apologize to Lisa.

00:06:09.578 --> 00:06:11.621
[SIEGFRIED] Seems the blacksmith
isn't our only problem.

00:06:11.663 --> 00:06:13.415
We must be wary of the girl.

00:06:13.456 --> 00:06:16.001
You mean the one from
the Knight Guard, sir?

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.252
Yes.

00:06:17.294 --> 00:06:19.379
Want me to take care of her?

00:06:19.421 --> 00:06:20.714
Not just yet.

00:06:20.755 --> 00:06:22.841
Right now I want you to
concentrate on gathering men

00:06:22.883 --> 00:06:25.010
who'll join our forces.

00:06:25.051 --> 00:06:26.553
I'll do my best, sir.

00:06:31.975 --> 00:06:34.144
It's one of the
Empire's coaches.

00:06:38.899 --> 00:06:41.234
[CECILY gasps]
That's-- No way!

00:06:42.193 --> 00:06:45.238
[CECILY]
It's the man in black!

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.489
[CECILY grunts]

00:06:47.657 --> 00:06:50.201
[CECILY]
Damn you!

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:54.331
[CECILY gasps]

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.417
Insolence toward my Lord
Siegfried will not be tolerated.

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:59.419
"Lord Siegfried?"

00:06:59.461 --> 00:07:03.965
Let go of me! This is important!
He's the man in black, I swear!

00:07:04.007 --> 00:07:06.927
[SIEGFRIED] Hm! Did you really
think you could assassinate

00:07:06.968 --> 00:07:09.220
a commander of
the Imperial army?

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:11.473
You bastard! Countless
lives have been lost

00:07:11.514 --> 00:07:14.476
because of your brutal
attacks on our city!

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.728
What's going on out here?

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.271
[CECILY]
Captain Hannibal!

00:07:18.313 --> 00:07:20.482
This Siegfried guy
is the Man in Black!

00:07:20.523 --> 00:07:21.524
[HANNIBAL]
Huh?

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:22.984
You have no proof of that.

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:24.569
I saw you attack Luke!

00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:27.238
I am not gonna let you
weasel your way out of this!

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.365
I'm sorry, young lady,

00:07:28.406 --> 00:07:30.659
but I have no recollection
of meeting you.

00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:32.535
Cecily. You mustn't
speak that way

00:07:32.577 --> 00:07:34.621
about a high-ranking
official of the Empire.

00:07:34.663 --> 00:07:36.665
Be careful or you'll
be accused of slander.

00:07:36.706 --> 00:07:38.792
I've got all the proof I need!

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.627
Charlotte Frobisher
warned me about a man

00:07:40.669 --> 00:07:42.337
from the Empire
named Siegfried.

00:07:42.379 --> 00:07:44.047
She said he was the
one who convinced them

00:07:44.089 --> 00:07:46.466
to try and steal Aria
and capture Luke!

00:07:46.508 --> 00:07:47.717
Is that so?

00:07:47.759 --> 00:07:49.135
[SIEGFRIED]
You've been played for a fool.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:50.011
[CECILY]
What?

00:07:50.053 --> 00:07:52.597
She was an imposter
posing as a princess.

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:54.557
You shouldn't trust
a delinquent like her.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:57.018
How dare you insult Charlotte!
Damn you!

00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.645
[LUKE]
That's enough, Cecily!

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.521
Luke?

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.856
The man's right, you don't
have the proof to accuse him.

00:08:01.898 --> 00:08:04.776
What are you talking about?
You were there, you saw him!

00:08:04.818 --> 00:08:07.654
Don't you have anything to say?

00:08:07.696 --> 00:08:09.114
I'm not surprised you
came up with some

00:08:09.155 --> 00:08:11.616
elaborate story together. Heh.

00:08:11.658 --> 00:08:15.620
The two of you are romantically
involved, aren't you?

00:08:15.662 --> 00:08:19.207
It seems your boyfriend is
now reneging on your story.

00:08:19.249 --> 00:08:21.710
Then you should consider
yourself lucky, Siegfried.

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:23.712
[grunts]
What?

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:26.798
I swear one day I will
take down the man in black.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.300
And no one will miss him.

00:08:29.342 --> 00:08:31.302
Tsk.

00:08:31.344 --> 00:08:33.888
I'm sorry, I don't know
what's gotten into them.

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:37.017
I assure you they'll be
punished for their behavior.

00:08:37.058 --> 00:08:38.184
[SIEGFRIED]
That's not necessary.

00:08:38.226 --> 00:08:40.478
In fact, I'd like the girl
to attend our meeting.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.397
[CECILY gasps]

00:08:45.567 --> 00:08:47.610
I don't think the Cambell
girl should be here.

00:08:47.652 --> 00:08:49.446
She already knows our secrets.

00:08:49.487 --> 00:08:53.700
It seems someone has taken
it upon himself to fill her in.

00:08:53.742 --> 00:08:55.910
Yes, Mister Ainsworth has
confirmed that he shared

00:08:55.952 --> 00:08:59.456
confidential information from
our meetings with Miss Cambell.

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.041
[ARTHUR]
Really?

00:09:01.082 --> 00:09:03.460
Guess we shouldn't have
trusted the blacksmith.

00:09:03.501 --> 00:09:05.879
It must've slipped out
during pillow talk.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:07.422
Ah, to be young again.

00:09:07.464 --> 00:09:08.298
[laughs]

00:09:08.339 --> 00:09:09.924
[grunts]

00:09:09.966 --> 00:09:12.886
That's enough, gentlemen.
Let's get this meeting started.

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.012
Now, Mister Ainsworth,

00:09:14.054 --> 00:09:16.806
have you brought the Sacred
Sword with you today?

00:09:18.099 --> 00:09:20.226
Took you long
enough to forge it.

00:09:20.268 --> 00:09:21.644
[LUKE]
It's not finished yet.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.562
[ARTHUR, JUSTINA gasps]

00:09:22.604 --> 00:09:23.938
[AREVIY]
How disappointing.

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.357
We've wasted all this time
waiting for nothing.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:28.902
Don't you realize how
important this is?

00:09:28.943 --> 00:09:31.738
Its importance has no bearing
on how long it takes to forge.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:33.323
Then work faster, damn it!

00:09:33.364 --> 00:09:35.492
The only reason we've
tolerated that demon of yours

00:09:35.533 --> 00:09:37.619
is because you're forging
this sword for us!

00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:41.039
Ah, yes. How could I forget the
demon you've been keeping.

00:09:41.081 --> 00:09:42.290
Lisa, was it?

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:44.959
[gasps]
Leave her out of this.

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:51.466
I've heard of the
power it possesses.

00:09:51.508 --> 00:09:52.759
With your forging spell,

00:09:52.801 --> 00:09:55.845
completing the Sacred Sword
should've been easy.

00:09:55.887 --> 00:09:58.556
The swords produced that
way are brittle and weak.

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:00.892
They could never keep
Valbanill sealed.

00:10:00.934 --> 00:10:03.353
So you're telling us
your swords are crap?

00:10:03.394 --> 00:10:05.480
Well, at least you're honest.

00:10:05.522 --> 00:10:08.399
Miss Oakwood, wasn't it?

00:10:08.441 --> 00:10:10.151
I should think the pain
you felt when your

00:10:10.193 --> 00:10:12.821
childhood friend was
taken from you by Valbanill

00:10:12.862 --> 00:10:15.907
would drive you to
finish the Sacred Sword.

00:10:15.949 --> 00:10:17.742
Poor little Lisa Oakwood.

00:10:17.784 --> 00:10:20.787
She died tragically, trying to
challenge Valbanill.

00:10:20.829 --> 00:10:23.373
[CECILY gasps]

00:10:23.414 --> 00:10:25.125
[LANCELOT]
Such a sad story.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:27.043
She ended up a demon
because she trusted

00:10:27.085 --> 00:10:28.795
one of your shoddy swords.

00:10:28.837 --> 00:10:30.839
In a way, it's all his fault.

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:33.758
You're right. It's a wonder
he hasn't been imprisoned.

00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.176
How can you say that?

00:10:35.218 --> 00:10:36.302
Shut up, Cecily.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.721
No! I can't listen
to this anymore!

00:10:38.763 --> 00:10:41.683
They're saying such
slanderous things about you!

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.184
How you can just
sit there quietly

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.145
while they insult
your precious Lisa?

00:10:45.186 --> 00:10:47.647
[grunts] Why don't you
mind your own business?

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:48.982
Calm down,
the both of you.

00:10:49.023 --> 00:10:51.192
I will not allow such
outbursts at this meeting.

00:10:51.234 --> 00:10:53.653
But you let them say these
horrible things about Luke?

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.697
Because he knows
it's the truth.

00:10:55.738 --> 00:10:57.699
Haven't you heard what happened?

00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:00.160
Your friend Luke changed
his first love into a demon

00:11:00.201 --> 00:11:02.412
in an effort to save
his own wretched life.

00:11:02.453 --> 00:11:03.955
[gasps]

00:11:03.997 --> 00:11:06.749
Well, well. He never told
you about that, did he?

00:11:06.791 --> 00:11:09.711
[CECILY grunts] I know Luke!
He would never do such a thing!

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:11.588
So you know his
left eye is fake,

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.715
but you haven't
ever wondered why?

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.342
[LANCELOT] You see Miss Cambell,
he used young Lisa Oakwood

00:11:16.384 --> 00:11:20.680
and his left eye as catalysts
in signing a Demon Contract.

00:11:20.722 --> 00:11:22.473
Isn't that right?

00:11:22.515 --> 00:11:23.391
Yes, sir.

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.559
Luke...

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:27.395
I don't remember much about
what happened that day.

00:11:27.437 --> 00:11:29.772
Both my father and
Lisa were killed.

00:11:29.814 --> 00:11:32.317
It was the only way
I could survive.

00:11:32.358 --> 00:11:34.152
I'm afraid I had no choice.

00:11:34.194 --> 00:11:35.069
No.

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:38.281
[ARTHUR] A horrific thing to
do to someone you care about.

00:11:38.323 --> 00:11:41.242
What's even more disgusting
is he named the demon Lisa

00:11:41.284 --> 00:11:43.953
as a constant reminder
of his brutal act.

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:45.580
Maybe he named it after the girl

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.749
so it could keep him
company on lonely nights.

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:49.918
I mean, who knows what
he makes that demon do

00:11:49.959 --> 00:11:51.085
behind closed doors.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:52.712
[laughs]

00:11:52.754 --> 00:11:55.632
[CECILY] How dare you accuse
Luke of something so horrific?

00:11:55.673 --> 00:11:57.258
I know how much
he cares for Lisa

00:11:57.300 --> 00:11:59.677
and I know he'd give
his life to protect her!

00:11:59.719 --> 00:12:00.595
Get out of here.

00:12:00.637 --> 00:12:02.180
[CECILY gasps]

00:12:02.222 --> 00:12:04.349
You have no business
being here, Cecily!

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.725
I want you to leave now!

00:12:05.767 --> 00:12:07.560
[CECILY]
I-I was just trying to help.

00:12:07.602 --> 00:12:09.520
You don't know me
as well as you think!

00:12:09.562 --> 00:12:13.858
I suggest you walk away now,
before I have you thrown out!

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.569
I'll have to ask you
to leave, Miss Cambell.

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.488
Sorry, kiddo.

00:12:18.529 --> 00:12:22.242
Oh, my. Don't you think you're
overreacting just a bit,

00:12:22.283 --> 00:12:24.160
Mr. Ainsworth?

00:12:27.538 --> 00:12:30.416
[CECILY grunts]
You're right, Luke.

00:12:30.458 --> 00:12:34.170
I may not know a lot about you,
but I know one thing for sure.

00:12:34.212 --> 00:12:36.965
I know deep down in my heart
that you would never turn

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:40.093
your beloved Lisa
Oakwood into a demon.

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.776
Well, that didn't take long.

00:12:56.818 --> 00:12:59.404
[LISA gasps]
Miss Cecily!

00:13:02.824 --> 00:13:04.367
Uh. Why don't you go
ahead and have a seat?

00:13:04.409 --> 00:13:07.245
[CECILY]
Lisa. I'm sorry.

00:13:07.287 --> 00:13:08.871
I've been a real bad friend.

00:13:08.913 --> 00:13:11.874
I'm sure you could tell I was
kinda avoiding you this morning.

00:13:11.916 --> 00:13:14.127
No, it's okay, I understand.

00:13:14.168 --> 00:13:16.587
I would be kinda freaked out
too if I suddenly found out

00:13:16.629 --> 00:13:18.589
my friend was a demon.

00:13:18.631 --> 00:13:20.967
I just want you to know,
it makes no difference.

00:13:21.009 --> 00:13:22.802
I mean, who cares if
you're really a demon?

00:13:22.844 --> 00:13:25.888
You're still Lisa, and I'm
proud to call you my friend.

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:27.598
So, yeah. Sorry.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:30.727
[LISA gasps]
Thanks!

00:13:30.768 --> 00:13:32.854
You want me to hand Luke over?

00:13:32.895 --> 00:13:34.897
The Emperor is not
as lenient as you.

00:13:34.939 --> 00:13:37.066
He'll force him to forge
the sword by week's end.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:39.152
[HOUSMAN]
I cannot allow that.

00:13:39.193 --> 00:13:41.404
You said yourself it's
imperative for each nation

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:44.032
to cooperate in order to
seal Valbanill forever!

00:13:44.073 --> 00:13:44.991
Here's an idea,

00:13:45.033 --> 00:13:48.036
why don't we kidnap the
Garrison State's swordsmith?

00:13:48.077 --> 00:13:50.371
That's why I never divulged
our blacksmith's name,

00:13:50.413 --> 00:13:52.790
I knew you scoundrels
weren't trustworthy.

00:13:52.832 --> 00:13:54.208
What? How dare you!

00:13:55.585 --> 00:13:57.462
Stop! Enough arguing!

00:13:57.503 --> 00:14:00.423
Let's take a short recess,
try and calm down.

00:14:04.844 --> 00:14:07.221
[SIEGFRIED] Such a pointless
meeting, don't you think?

00:14:07.263 --> 00:14:09.098
Each of them is worried
about their own nation

00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:10.892
and not the greater good.

00:14:10.933 --> 00:14:12.769
Sometimes I think
it would be best if

00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:16.272
we burned everything to the
ground and started over again.

00:14:16.314 --> 00:14:17.940
[SIEGFRIED chuckles]

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:37.543
[LISA] They said all
that at the meeting?

00:14:37.585 --> 00:14:40.463
Yeah and Luke didn't even
try to stand up for himself.

00:14:40.505 --> 00:14:43.091
He's probably afraid
because of me.

00:14:43.132 --> 00:14:44.967
Demons are usually
condemned to death,

00:14:45.009 --> 00:14:47.845
but for some reason they
made an exception with me.

00:14:47.887 --> 00:14:51.057
I'm sure he feels indebted to
them for allowing me to live.

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:54.352
[LUKE]
I always worry.

00:14:54.394 --> 00:14:57.688
Because protecting her
is my reason for being.

00:14:57.730 --> 00:15:00.108
I would give my life for Lisa.

00:15:00.149 --> 00:15:02.151
[CECILY] He said he
would've done anything,

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:03.694
and I believe him.

00:15:03.736 --> 00:15:05.279
It doesn't make sense.

00:15:05.321 --> 00:15:07.156
Hey, are you okay?

00:15:07.198 --> 00:15:08.616
[CECILY]
Oh, sorry.

00:15:08.658 --> 00:15:11.369
I was just thinking about how
they said Luke used Lisa's

00:15:11.411 --> 00:15:13.496
body to sign a Demon Contract.

00:15:13.538 --> 00:15:15.081
I just don't see how
he ever could've

00:15:15.123 --> 00:15:16.749
done something like that.

00:15:16.791 --> 00:15:18.793
I know, but according to
the people who knew her,

00:15:18.835 --> 00:15:21.838
there's no doubt I was
created from Lisa Oakwood.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:23.005
What do you mean?

00:15:23.047 --> 00:15:24.924
[LISA] They've told me
I look just like she did

00:15:24.966 --> 00:15:27.009
when she was little.

00:15:27.051 --> 00:15:28.261
But it's strange.

00:15:28.302 --> 00:15:31.347
None of her memories were
carried over when I was created.

00:15:31.389 --> 00:15:33.516
Even our personalities
are different.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:35.893
That's why Luke regrets
naming me after her.

00:15:35.935 --> 00:15:38.271
The two of us have
nothing in common.

00:15:38.312 --> 00:15:40.314
Come on, you know
better than that.

00:15:40.356 --> 00:15:41.941
But that's what he told me.

00:15:41.983 --> 00:15:43.484
[CECILY]
Lisa...

00:15:43.526 --> 00:15:45.903
I know he's gotta be suffering.

00:15:45.945 --> 00:15:47.947
It has to be painful
when he looks at me

00:15:47.989 --> 00:15:51.534
'cause he's constantly reminded
of his beloved Lisa Oakwood.

00:15:51.576 --> 00:15:53.661
But I'm nothing like her.

00:15:53.703 --> 00:15:56.789
He treats me so well,
even though it hurts.

00:15:56.831 --> 00:15:59.083
He always takes good care of me.

00:15:59.125 --> 00:16:01.461
But I think it's his way
of punishing himself

00:16:01.502 --> 00:16:03.671
for not being able
to protect Lisa.

00:16:03.713 --> 00:16:05.590
Punishing himself?

00:16:05.631 --> 00:16:07.508
I was unable to protect her.

00:16:07.550 --> 00:16:10.470
[CECILY] He wouldn't hurt her,
he wanted to protect her!

00:16:10.511 --> 00:16:12.847
Surely she wanted to
do the same for him.

00:16:12.889 --> 00:16:14.640
[LISA]
I never meant to make him sad,

00:16:14.682 --> 00:16:17.059
I just wanted to be by his side.

00:16:17.101 --> 00:16:20.104
Making his dinner,
and doing the laundry,

00:16:20.146 --> 00:16:22.106
working around the house.

00:16:22.148 --> 00:16:25.651
All I ever wanted was
to make him happy.

00:16:25.693 --> 00:16:27.278
That's it.

00:16:33.326 --> 00:16:35.036
They were all wrong.

00:16:36.579 --> 00:16:40.458
Yes! That has to be it!

00:16:43.586 --> 00:16:45.213
[ALL gasp]

00:16:45.254 --> 00:16:46.297
[HOUSMAN]
Miss Cambell?

00:16:46.339 --> 00:16:47.924
I have something to say.

00:16:47.965 --> 00:16:50.968
We have more important things
to do than argue with you!

00:16:51.010 --> 00:16:52.887
No. You need to hear this.

00:16:52.929 --> 00:16:54.597
I know the truth
about what happened.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:57.141
[LANCELOT] You mean between
Luke and Lisa Oakwood?

00:16:57.183 --> 00:16:59.644
Yes, sir. I know for a
fact that Luke didn't sign

00:16:59.685 --> 00:17:01.479
a Demon Contract
three years ago.

00:17:01.521 --> 00:17:02.355
[AREVIY]
Oh really?

00:17:02.396 --> 00:17:05.274
Then just how do you explain
the existence of the demon?

00:17:05.316 --> 00:17:07.109
Lisa signed it herself.

00:17:07.151 --> 00:17:10.363
No! That's not true!
That's impossible!

00:17:10.404 --> 00:17:12.532
Just listen to
what I have to say.

00:17:12.573 --> 00:17:13.491
[grunts]

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:15.117
[CECILY] First of all,
a Demon Contract

00:17:15.159 --> 00:17:16.827
can't be forced
onto someone else.

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:19.497
Far as I know, the only person
who can sign the contract

00:17:19.539 --> 00:17:21.916
is the one who agrees to
read their death song.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:24.502
Well, that is the protocol, yes.

00:17:24.544 --> 00:17:27.255
But couldn't he have forced
Lisa to read her death song?

00:17:27.296 --> 00:17:29.382
It happened all the
time back in the War.

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:30.967
No, sir. He didn't do that.

00:17:31.008 --> 00:17:32.677
Bah. I don't buy it.

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.178
Luke has told me many times

00:17:34.220 --> 00:17:36.097
how he wanted to
protect Lisa Oakwood

00:17:36.138 --> 00:17:38.224
and I'm sure she wanted
to protect him as well.

00:17:38.266 --> 00:17:40.560
[LUKE] Shuddup!
You don't know anything!

00:17:40.601 --> 00:17:43.479
That's why she signed a
Demon Contract that day.

00:17:43.521 --> 00:17:45.314
She wanted to protect Luke.

00:17:45.356 --> 00:17:46.983
[gasps]

00:17:47.024 --> 00:17:49.402
[ARTHUR] That's a great story
but do you have any proof?

00:17:49.443 --> 00:17:51.445
[CECILY] My proof is the
fact that the demon Lisa

00:17:51.487 --> 00:17:53.114
was even created.

00:17:53.155 --> 00:17:54.824
What are you insinuating?

00:17:54.865 --> 00:17:56.784
[CECILY] If Luke was
attempting to create a demon

00:17:56.826 --> 00:17:58.452
that would protect him
against Valbanill,

00:17:58.494 --> 00:18:00.621
then why wouldn't he have
chosen a bigger, stronger one?

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.957
It doesn't make sense for him
to create a demon in the form

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:04.584
of a little girl, does it?

00:18:04.625 --> 00:18:06.294
[LANCELOT]
How should we know?

00:18:06.335 --> 00:18:08.379
Well, I have the answer.

00:18:08.421 --> 00:18:11.299
It's because that's what
Lisa Oakwood wanted.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:13.509
She wanted to protect him
and take care of him

00:18:13.551 --> 00:18:16.220
even after her own life ended.

00:18:16.262 --> 00:18:18.514
That's why she took that form.

00:18:18.556 --> 00:18:20.725
Demon Lisa is just
like a normal girl.

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:23.311
She makes dinner,
does the laundry,

00:18:23.352 --> 00:18:26.981
anything she can to help
the person she cares about.

00:18:27.023 --> 00:18:30.276
Even her special powers
to magically forge katana.

00:18:30.318 --> 00:18:32.820
It's all for her beloved Luke.

00:18:32.862 --> 00:18:35.948
When Lisa Oakwood knew her
life was coming to an end,

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:37.700
she turned her
passion to support

00:18:37.742 --> 00:18:40.119
and protect Luke
into the demon Lisa.

00:18:40.161 --> 00:18:42.413
That's the only
way to explain it.

00:18:43.539 --> 00:18:46.042
And that's what really
happened three years ago.

00:18:46.083 --> 00:18:48.919
[grunts]
You weren't even there, Cecily!

00:18:48.961 --> 00:18:50.713
You have no idea what
she went through!

00:18:50.755 --> 00:18:53.174
Yes I do, 'cause I'm
just like her!

00:18:53.215 --> 00:18:55.926
Lisa Oakwood wanted to
be a knight one day.

00:18:55.968 --> 00:18:57.386
I understand that feeling,

00:18:57.428 --> 00:19:00.681
the need to protect this city
and the people she loved.

00:19:00.723 --> 00:19:03.059
[CECILY] That's why she wanted
you to forge a katana for her,

00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.394
Luke, so she'd be
a better knight!

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:07.104
I know how she felt.

00:19:07.146 --> 00:19:10.358
She and I have the same
goals and dreams in life.

00:19:10.399 --> 00:19:13.444
I know it's the truth because
I would've done the same.

00:19:13.486 --> 00:19:15.905
[LUKE] That's bull!
You're nothing like her!

00:19:15.946 --> 00:19:17.531
She'd never give up like that!

00:19:17.573 --> 00:19:20.451
She was a far better knight
than you'll ever be!

00:19:20.493 --> 00:19:23.412
All I remember of that day
is how helpless I felt.

00:19:23.454 --> 00:19:25.956
The katana I made
her broke instantly.

00:19:25.998 --> 00:19:27.708
I couldn't do
anything to save her.

00:19:27.750 --> 00:19:30.002
I just stood there
and watched it happen.

00:19:30.044 --> 00:19:32.004
And that's why I'm
always so preoccupied

00:19:32.046 --> 00:19:34.548
with protecting the demon Lisa.

00:19:34.590 --> 00:19:37.134
I thought maybe that
would make it up to her.

00:19:37.176 --> 00:19:40.054
[CECILY] Oh, would you open
your eyes, Luke Ainsworth?

00:19:40.096 --> 00:19:41.305
[LUKE gasps]

00:19:45.267 --> 00:19:47.770
[CECILY] It's time for you to
stop feeling sorry for yourself

00:19:47.812 --> 00:19:50.106
and take a look at what's
right in front of you.

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:53.150
I know failing to protect
Lisa hurt you deeply.

00:19:53.192 --> 00:19:55.277
However, I also know
your pain drove you

00:19:55.319 --> 00:19:58.239
to become an even
better blacksmith.

00:19:58.280 --> 00:20:00.199
You made a promise to yourself.

00:20:00.241 --> 00:20:02.868
Someday you would
forge a perfect katana.

00:20:02.910 --> 00:20:06.247
And you swore it would
be able to protect this city

00:20:06.288 --> 00:20:08.624
and your loved ones
just like Lisa hoped.

00:20:08.666 --> 00:20:10.334
You weren't out to
just seal Valbanill.

00:20:10.376 --> 00:20:11.502
You wanted to make something

00:20:11.544 --> 00:20:13.462
that would keep
any enemy at bay.

00:20:13.504 --> 00:20:15.715
Then the citizens of
Housman could rest easy

00:20:15.756 --> 00:20:18.759
knowing they were safe
because of your perfect sword.

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:21.387
Don't you see, Luke? This is it!

00:20:21.429 --> 00:20:24.348
A katana forged out
of your love for Lisa.

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:27.017
This is the Sacred Sword
we've been waiting for!

00:20:29.603 --> 00:20:34.650
[SIEGFRIED laughs]
Ridiculous.

00:20:34.692 --> 00:20:37.695
You underestimate the power
of Valbanill, little girl.

00:20:37.737 --> 00:20:39.113
[CECILY, LUKE grunt]

00:20:40.573 --> 00:20:42.074
[JUSTINA gasps]

00:20:43.409 --> 00:20:46.412
Oh really? Let's see you
cut through this katana.

00:20:46.454 --> 00:20:49.206
Go ahead, give it a try!

00:20:49.248 --> 00:20:52.376
Heh. As you wish.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:53.669
[SIEGFRIED]
Let me borrow this.

00:20:53.711 --> 00:20:54.920
[AREVIY]
Mm.

00:21:05.848 --> 00:21:07.558
[LANCELOT]
Hm? Ah!

00:21:13.856 --> 00:21:16.942
[SIEGFRIED grunts]

00:21:20.654 --> 00:21:23.032
[CECILY]
I'm sorry, Luke.

00:21:23.073 --> 00:21:24.200
I hope I didn't upset you

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:27.244
when I was talking about
how I think Lisa felt.

00:21:27.286 --> 00:21:29.747
It's just I think I have a good
idea since we're similar.

00:21:29.789 --> 00:21:30.748
[LUKE scoffs]

00:21:30.790 --> 00:21:34.251
Don't you scoff at me.
I'm trying to be serious here.

00:21:35.377 --> 00:21:37.797
I know the past can
sometimes be overwhelming,

00:21:37.838 --> 00:21:40.132
but please don't lose
sight of the present,

00:21:40.174 --> 00:21:42.635
because that's what's
most important.

00:21:43.302 --> 00:21:45.638
[giggles]

00:21:45.679 --> 00:21:47.181
Lisa.

00:21:52.728 --> 00:21:55.231
[ONE-EYED BIRD DEMON roars]

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:58.818
[TWO-HEADED DEMON growls]

00:21:58.859 --> 00:22:01.570
[CITIZENS shouting]

00:22:05.199 --> 00:22:07.701
[SIEGFRIED] A Sacred Sword
built out of love?

00:22:07.743 --> 00:22:09.745
Preposterous!

00:22:09.787 --> 00:22:13.415
The thought disgusts me.
It's repulsive.

00:22:13.457 --> 00:22:15.251
I must kill them all!

00:22:15.292 --> 00:22:19.171
Luke Ainsworth, Cecily Cambell.

00:22:19.213 --> 00:22:21.632
I shall send you both to Hell.
