[CECILY grunts]

00:00:16.308 --> 00:00:18.227
What is wrong with you, coward?

00:00:18.268 --> 00:00:20.020
You don't deserve
to be a Knight Guard!

00:00:24.316 --> 00:00:26.735
[ARIA]
Wow. Aren't you an early riser.

00:00:26.777 --> 00:00:29.196
[CECILY] Oh, hey, Aria.
Good morning.

00:00:29.238 --> 00:00:31.740
Do you always get up
this early for training?

00:00:31.782 --> 00:00:33.992
Yeah, every day since
I was a little girl.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:36.954
I think persistence is the key
to becoming a good swordsman.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:39.498
Well, you certainly
are persistent, Cecily.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.041
I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

00:00:41.083 --> 00:00:43.460
As you should.
But what's with this business?

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.422
Is there a reason
you're swinging like that?

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:50.092
Yeah, I'm trying to practice
the way you'd use a katana.

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.969
You have to handle them
differently than you would

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.136
a regular sword.

00:00:53.178 --> 00:00:54.471
So I have to try and
get this move down,

00:00:54.513 --> 00:00:58.433
or I'll have a hard time with a
katana once I finally get one.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.186
See? Like that.

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:02.604
S'why I chose this sword.

00:01:02.646 --> 00:01:04.439
It's the most katana-like.

00:01:04.481 --> 00:01:06.733
He may not do it now,
but Luke will forge one

00:01:06.775 --> 00:01:07.943
for me someday.

00:01:07.985 --> 00:01:09.486
[ARIA]
Well, yeah, he's your boyfriend,

00:01:09.528 --> 00:01:10.821
it's the least he can do.

00:01:10.862 --> 00:01:12.864
[CECILY gasps]
Aria!

00:01:12.906 --> 00:01:14.116
Luke isn't my boyfriend!

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:16.451
I wouldn't go near that jerk
if my life depended on it!

00:02:54.633 --> 00:02:56.802
Something wrong?

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:58.887
Nah, everything's fine.

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.138
I meant to ask.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.640
Have you been sneaking
into bed with me

00:03:01.682 --> 00:03:02.849
the last few nights?

00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:04.309
Heck, yes!

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:07.688
Your body is so warm when
I snuggle up next to you.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:09.606
It almost feels like
I'm going to melt.

00:03:09.648 --> 00:03:11.983
And your breasts are
so soft and squishy,

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:15.946
I can't help but use them
as my own personal pillow.

00:03:15.987 --> 00:03:18.031
Why is everyone so
obsessed with my boobs?

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:21.660
If I had a rack like yours, I'd
use them to get what I want.

00:03:21.702 --> 00:03:24.371
Men are weak when it comes
to breasts. Seriously.

00:03:24.413 --> 00:03:28.583
Try flashing Luke, I bet he'll
forge you a katana or two.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.544
Yeah. He's seen them.

00:03:30.585 --> 00:03:33.088
See? You know I'm right, then.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.091
No. It was an accident.

00:03:36.133 --> 00:03:39.094
Could we please stop talking
about my chest now, Aria?

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:40.595
I'm incredibly jealous.

00:03:40.637 --> 00:03:43.098
What are you talking about?
Your boobs are just as big.

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.892
No, not that.
Of your sword.

00:03:45.934 --> 00:03:46.977
Y'see it's just...

00:03:47.018 --> 00:03:49.855
I can be a merciless weapon
in the wrong person's hands.

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.816
But if I were in your hands, I'd
never have to worry about it.

00:03:52.858 --> 00:03:56.611
You wouldn't abuse my power;
you'd use me to protect people.

00:03:56.653 --> 00:03:59.114
If you were my master, Cecily,

00:03:59.156 --> 00:04:02.659
I could produce a peaceful
wind instead of a violent one.

00:04:02.701 --> 00:04:05.537
One day, maybe I'll get my wish.

00:04:09.207 --> 00:04:11.293
I'm sorry, I can be
a bit of a dreamer.

00:04:13.128 --> 00:04:14.171
Aria.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.297
Yeah?

00:04:15.338 --> 00:04:17.799
I'm a rookie knight who can't
take the life of her enemy.

00:04:17.841 --> 00:04:19.926
I can't even use
a sword properly.

00:04:19.968 --> 00:04:22.763
I may not be a suitable master
but I'm certainly capable

00:04:22.804 --> 00:04:25.015
of being your friend.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:27.309
Would you do me the honor
of being my friend?

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:30.145
I promise I'll always
be there for you.

00:04:30.187 --> 00:04:32.189
'Kay. But only if you're
sure about this.

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.149
A knight always keeps her word.

00:04:34.191 --> 00:04:36.485
It almost sounds like you're
proposing to me, huh?

00:04:37.694 --> 00:04:39.404
Yeah, I guess.

00:04:39.446 --> 00:04:42.491
Then, I ask you to do me the
honor of being my friend.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:44.743
Scratch that. I demand it!

00:04:44.785 --> 00:04:46.161
[CECILY]
Guess I don't have much choice.

00:04:46.203 --> 00:04:47.954
A sword always
keeps her word.

00:04:47.996 --> 00:04:51.374
Okay, now it really
sounds like a proposal!

00:04:51.416 --> 00:04:53.960
[laughing]

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.012
[HANNIBAL]
This is a dangerous gambit,

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.014
but I don't see any other way.

00:05:06.056 --> 00:05:08.683
[HOUSMAN] The Sword is
the festival's #1 attraction.

00:05:08.725 --> 00:05:11.228
It would be bad for
business if we don't.

00:05:11.269 --> 00:05:13.563
But if we do show her as
planned, a demon attack

00:05:13.605 --> 00:05:16.525
within the city limits
is inevitable.

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:19.736
If possible, I'd like to
avoid civilian casualties.

00:05:21.071 --> 00:05:23.281
[HANNIBAL] Unfortunately, that
is something we may not have

00:05:23.323 --> 00:05:24.699
much control over.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:27.953
[HOUSMAN]
Still.

00:05:27.994 --> 00:05:30.247
We'll do whatever we must to
protect the people of Housman.

00:05:30.288 --> 00:05:32.207
No worries, the Knight
Guards will be on duty

00:05:32.249 --> 00:05:33.917
to ensure everyone's safety.

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:35.043
Good.

00:05:35.085 --> 00:05:37.420
Only thing that might prove
difficult is keeping all this

00:05:37.462 --> 00:05:39.631
a secret from the civilians.

00:05:39.673 --> 00:05:41.675
It's hard to know something
bad is about to happen

00:05:41.716 --> 00:05:44.219
and not be able to warn anyone.

00:05:44.261 --> 00:05:47.472
If we face another attack,
I'm bound to lose more men.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:49.266
--However--
--There's no choice.

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:50.225
[HANNIBAL]
Exactly.

00:05:50.267 --> 00:05:51.768
This is what we have to do.

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.687
We'll use the Demon Sword as
bait to draw out the man

00:05:53.728 --> 00:05:55.021
in black.

00:05:55.063 --> 00:05:57.315
Once we capture him,
this hell will be over.

00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:01.319
Oh, there you are, Miss Cambell.

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:02.696
It took you long enough.

00:06:02.737 --> 00:06:04.447
I have another special
mission for you.

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:06.116
--Think you can handle it?
--[CECILY] R-Really?

00:06:06.157 --> 00:06:08.660
There's gonna be a presentation
of the Demon Sword tomorrow,

00:06:08.702 --> 00:06:11.580
and I want you onstage
as her handler.

00:06:11.621 --> 00:06:12.622
Huh?

00:06:23.633 --> 00:06:27.095
[CECILY] Luke. I have a
hypothetical question for you.

00:06:27.137 --> 00:06:30.015
So, imagine you were
responsible for the wellbeing

00:06:30.056 --> 00:06:31.892
of one of your closest friends.

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:33.810
And you found out you might
have to put that person

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:35.270
through something dangerous.

00:06:35.312 --> 00:06:37.272
What would you do?

00:06:37.314 --> 00:06:39.316
And this is a
hypothetical question?

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:41.860
Yeah, just go with it.

00:06:41.902 --> 00:06:44.613
If it was me, I wouldn't
put them in danger.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:46.990
I'll never let that
happen again.

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:50.660
But if I couldn't stop them from
being stuck in that situation,

00:06:50.702 --> 00:06:53.079
then I'd protect that
person with my life.

00:06:56.666 --> 00:06:57.959
So what's this all about?

00:06:57.959 --> 00:06:59.836
That didn't really
sound hypothetical.

00:06:59.878 --> 00:07:00.962
Is there something wrong?

00:07:01.004 --> 00:07:02.422
No. Thank you.

[CECILY grunts]

00:07:15.727 --> 00:07:17.604
Aria?

00:07:17.646 --> 00:07:19.731
I've been given new orders,
and I may have to put you

00:07:19.773 --> 00:07:21.858
in danger. I'm sorry.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.402
I don't want to,
but I have no say in it.

00:07:24.444 --> 00:07:26.947
They told me to keep
it a secret, but...

00:07:26.988 --> 00:07:28.573
But they want to
use you as bait to--

00:07:28.615 --> 00:07:31.201
[ARIA]
I'm not worried.

00:07:31.242 --> 00:07:34.537
Because I believe
in you, friend.

00:07:34.579 --> 00:07:35.747
Aria.

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.166
I'm looking forward to
the show tomorrow.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:39.292
Me too.

00:07:39.334 --> 00:07:41.378
I promise I will protect
you with my life!

Demon Sword?

00:07:45.715 --> 00:07:46.549
[MAN IN BLACK]
That's right.

00:07:46.591 --> 00:07:49.260
Your salvation lies
within that sword.

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.887
You do want salvation,
don't you?

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:52.430
[JACK]
Oh, yes.

00:07:52.472 --> 00:07:54.557
Give the Sword to me.

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.101
All you have to do is take it.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.728
Take back what's
rightfully yours.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.690
Yes? The Demon Sword
belongs to you.

[JACK]
The Demon Sword.

00:08:03.525 --> 00:08:06.945
I must have it.

00:08:06.987 --> 00:08:08.571
It's mine!

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:23.128
Behold! The ultimate
Demon Sword.

The Baselard of Greed,

Don't wait for the price drop,
first come first serve!

So pick one up now.

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.514
Was that really a Demon Sword?

00:08:34.556 --> 00:08:36.141
No, it was a fake.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:37.642
Yeah, I should've known.

Hey, where are you going?

[LUKE] Man, the selection
this year sucks.

What do you mean?

What about Miss Aria?

00:08:57.495 --> 00:08:59.456
I might be able to
defeat Valbanill if I had

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:01.541
a hundred swords like her.

00:09:01.583 --> 00:09:03.293
But even that may not be enough.

00:09:11.301 --> 00:09:13.094
You need to calm down, Cecily.

00:09:13.136 --> 00:09:14.804
[CECILY]
Easy for you to say.

Don't worry, I'm sure
you'll do fine out there.

Well, that's unfortunate.

I know plenty of young men

I am the knight who killed you.

00:20:30.604 --> 00:20:33.190
All I ask is that you
never forget my name.

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:35.401
I will never forget
yours either.

00:20:35.443 --> 00:20:37.153
I promise you, Jack.

00:20:41.323 --> 00:20:45.619
As the wind carried him away,
I heard his final thoughts.

00:20:45.661 --> 00:20:47.538
Tell me.

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:49.457
"I will never forget."

00:20:49.498 --> 00:20:50.624
Thank you.

00:20:55.755 --> 00:20:59.008
[HOUSMAN] To the families of the
32 priceless lives we've lost,

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:02.511
I extend my sincerest
condolences and apologies.

00:21:02.553 --> 00:21:05.556
I take personal responsibility
for what's happened.

00:21:05.598 --> 00:21:08.267
We must keep their
memory alive in our hearts,

00:21:08.309 --> 00:21:11.437
as a constant reminder to
never let a tragedy like this

00:21:11.479 --> 00:21:12.855
occur again.

00:21:12.897 --> 00:21:14.690
[ARIA]
I guess this is goodbye.

00:21:14.732 --> 00:21:16.192
[CECILY]
Yeah.

00:21:16.233 --> 00:21:18.194
[ARIA]
It always happens like this.

00:21:18.235 --> 00:21:21.280
Wherever I go I bring
death and misfortune.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:24.658
Before long, people want
nothing more to do with me.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.869
So they throw me out of town.

00:21:26.911 --> 00:21:28.788
Aria.

00:21:28.829 --> 00:21:30.831
I wonder where I'll end up next.

00:21:30.873 --> 00:21:34.460
I only hope I meet someone
as nice as you there.

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:37.046
Don't be silly.

00:21:37.087 --> 00:21:39.882
You're not going anywhere.
I promised I'd protect you.

00:21:39.924 --> 00:21:41.467
And I will.

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:42.635
Really?

00:21:42.676 --> 00:21:45.262
Aria. I know you're not
some kind of evil sword

00:21:45.304 --> 00:21:46.806
that's out to hurt people.

00:21:46.847 --> 00:21:48.641
You're a sword
that protects them.

00:21:48.682 --> 00:21:50.226
I want you to stay here.

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:51.393
To fight alongside me.

00:21:51.435 --> 00:21:54.021
We can protect the citizens
of Housman together.

00:21:56.273 --> 00:21:59.151
Would you do me the
honor of being my friend?

00:21:59.193 --> 00:22:01.487
Would you do me the
honor of being my partner?

00:22:04.156 --> 00:22:07.368
[ARIA]
Your wish is my command.

00:22:07.409 --> 00:22:09.370
I couldn't ask for
a better master.

00:22:09.411 --> 00:22:10.663
I would love to.

00:22:13.874 --> 00:22:15.793
And a sword always
keeps her word!

00:22:16.961 --> 00:22:18.087
Yeah.
