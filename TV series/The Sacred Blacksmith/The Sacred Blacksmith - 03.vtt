WEBVTT

00:00:10.427 --> 00:00:12.012
[NARRATOR]
Blood.

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:15.390
The color of the sky,
when first she saw it.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.103
The first smell she
experienced in this world.

00:00:21.647 --> 00:00:24.191
[SOLDIERS yelling]

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.235
[SOLDIER A groans]

00:00:26.276 --> 00:00:29.112
[NARRATOR] Her first memories
of taking lives,

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:31.740
and of lives being taken.

00:00:44.378 --> 00:00:48.340
[NARRATOR] A nightmare from
which no one can escape.

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:50.342
[screams]

00:00:50.384 --> 00:00:54.805
[panting]

00:00:54.846 --> 00:01:00.727
Why won't these memories let me
rest? Where is my salvation?

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:03.397
[GUARD] You haven't even
touched your food.

00:01:03.438 --> 00:01:07.276
The others are stuffing their
faces like a bunch of pigs.

00:01:07.317 --> 00:01:09.820
Oh well, to each his own.

00:01:09.861 --> 00:01:13.907
I'm all alone. Why only me?

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:55.050
My name is Aria. Cecily, right?

00:02:55.092 --> 00:02:58.178
Uh, y-yeah.
Nice to meet you, too.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:00.097
I cannot thank you enough
for taking on this

00:03:00.138 --> 00:03:02.265
most important mission,
Miss Cambell.

00:03:02.307 --> 00:03:04.893
[CECILY]
Sure. But, uh...

00:03:04.935 --> 00:03:08.105
Where is this cargo I'm
supposed to be protecting, sir?

00:03:08.146 --> 00:03:11.274
Captain Hannibal? I thought
you were going to tell her.

00:03:11.316 --> 00:03:14.236
Yeah, but I thought it'd
be funnier if I didn't.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.987
Oh. You're a naughty boy, sir.

00:03:16.029 --> 00:03:18.365
[HANNIBAL laughs]

00:03:18.407 --> 00:03:20.867
Um, Cecily. I'm what
you'll be protecting.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:23.328
Uh. But I thought you
said I was protecting

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.538
some kind of Demon Sword?

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:26.373
That's right, you are.

00:03:26.415 --> 00:03:28.583
I am the Demon Sword.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.210
Wha--?

00:03:31.461 --> 00:03:34.381
[LUKE] I don't get it.
What does your new mission

00:03:34.423 --> 00:03:37.092
have to do with you
showing up here uninvited?

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:39.094
Aww. Don't be such a sour puss.

00:03:39.136 --> 00:03:41.555
I'm not here to bug you
for a katana today.

00:03:41.596 --> 00:03:42.639
Good, cause you wouldn't know

00:03:42.681 --> 00:03:44.057
what to do with
one if you had it.

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.352
[laughs] Oh, he can
be such a joker.

00:03:47.394 --> 00:03:49.396
Obviously your friend
here is too stupid

00:03:49.438 --> 00:03:50.731
to know when she's
being insulted.

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.483
[laughs] You're dead.

00:03:54.568 --> 00:03:57.028
[sighs] Don't you get
tired of fighting?

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.948
So, I don't mean to pry,
but are these two a couple?

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.201
[gasps, yells]

00:04:03.243 --> 00:04:04.661
[CECILY] You better hurry
and set the record straight

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.038
with her or I'm going
straight for your jugular!

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.498
Like anyone'd think
we're together

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.168
with you tryin' ta kill me.
I think it's pretty clear!

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.337
[ARIA laughs]
Oh, that's awesome!

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.798
[LUKE] Maybe when you
let go of me, psycho!

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.800
[CECILY] I'm warning you,
do it now or you're dead!

00:04:18.842 --> 00:04:20.427
[LUKE] Was that a threat?
I'm not afraid of you...

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.138
Wow! It's tasty, and so
much spirit energy!

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.347
[LISA]
You really like it?

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:26.308
I tried to get the
right mix of spices

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:28.894
and I mixed in some berries
I picked from the forest.

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:31.188
Really? If that's the case,

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:34.232
then that forest must be
full of spirit energy.

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.402
I guess this is a great
place for us to be, huh?

00:04:37.444 --> 00:04:39.738
[LISA gasps]

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:40.655
[ARIA laughs]

00:04:40.697 --> 00:04:43.492
[LUKE, CECILY grunting]

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:48.163
So, wanna tell us how she
becomes a Demon Sword?

00:04:48.205 --> 00:04:51.750
Maybe it's better
if we show you.

00:04:51.792 --> 00:04:53.960
Are you sure you're
okay with this, Aria?

00:04:54.002 --> 00:04:55.462
Yeah, sure.

00:04:55.504 --> 00:04:59.216
[inhales]

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:02.260
I call on the powers that be.

00:05:02.302 --> 00:05:05.931
Reveal the truth within.
Awaken the power of wind.

00:05:05.972 --> 00:05:07.557
Awaken, and slay God.

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:09.100
[BOTH gasp]

00:05:41.842 --> 00:05:44.261
[LISA]
Wow! She turned into a sword!

00:05:44.302 --> 00:05:45.303
[LUKE]
No, Lisa.

00:05:45.345 --> 00:05:48.348
The Demon Sword was taking
the form of a human.

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.433
There aren't very many like
it.

00:05:53.311 --> 00:05:55.689
Yeah well, that's not
all she can do.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.901
She controls wind, and attacks
with it. Watch this.

00:06:02.571 --> 00:06:04.531
Like an extension of my blade.

00:06:04.573 --> 00:06:06.741
[gasps] It's special, huh?

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:08.994
That Demon Sword looks like
it was forged differently

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:10.829
than the ones that
I've seen before.

00:06:10.871 --> 00:06:13.456
Yeah. It's unusual,
to say the least.

00:06:13.498 --> 00:06:15.876
Normally swords are
forged from tamahagane.

00:06:15.917 --> 00:06:17.586
But this one isn't.

00:06:17.627 --> 00:06:21.006
I'm not really sure what
a Demon Sword is made of.

00:06:21.047 --> 00:06:23.508
Isn't that cool? She's
pretty amazing, right?

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.887
[LUKE] It can take on human form
and manipulate the wind.

00:06:26.928 --> 00:06:28.722
It's a Demon Sword all right.

00:06:28.763 --> 00:06:31.391
[CECILY] Thanks, Aria.
You can change back now.

00:06:43.445 --> 00:06:44.863
And I'm back!

00:06:44.905 --> 00:06:45.739
So you are.

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:46.865
I don't get it.

00:06:46.907 --> 00:06:49.826
Nations would kill to get
ahold of a sword like "her."

00:06:49.868 --> 00:06:53.747
So why did they choose
you to protect her?

00:06:53.788 --> 00:06:55.832
Well, because my boss
knows that I can not only

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:57.667
keep Aria safe,
but also offer her

00:06:57.709 --> 00:06:59.586
a bit of fellow female
companionship.

00:06:59.628 --> 00:07:02.505
And nobody'll know she's the
sword in her human form.

00:07:02.547 --> 00:07:04.758
They would if I told everybody.

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:06.843
I'm not worried about that,
you don't have the guts.

00:07:06.885 --> 00:07:09.220
[grunting]

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:10.847
So, what, did you come
all the way out here

00:07:10.889 --> 00:07:11.765
just to pick on me?

00:07:11.806 --> 00:07:16.394
No. I came by because I wanted
to ask a favor of Lisa.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:17.979
Huh?!

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.400
[HANNIBAL] It's only a matter
of time before the enemy

00:07:22.442 --> 00:07:24.736
comes back for the Demon Sword.

00:07:24.778 --> 00:07:27.322
My concern is these bastards
might try to sign

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.950
a Demon Contract within
the gates of the city.

00:07:29.991 --> 00:07:31.451
[KNIGHT GUARDS murmur]

00:07:31.493 --> 00:07:33.578
If that were to happen,
we would likely lose

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:36.289
many men, and surely
some civilians.

00:07:36.331 --> 00:07:38.416
We're prepared to die to
protect the people, sir!

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:40.460
[KNIGHT GUARDS]
Right!

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:43.755
There's one thing I want
you men to remember.

00:07:43.797 --> 00:07:45.632
It is good to fear death!

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:48.677
Even the bravest knight fears
for his own demise.

00:07:48.718 --> 00:07:50.220
Let that give you strength

00:07:50.261 --> 00:07:53.223
and let that strength
guide you to victory!

00:07:53.264 --> 00:07:57.936
[laughs] How else do ya think
this old soldier survived

00:07:57.978 --> 00:08:00.605
the Valbanill War 44 years ago?

00:08:00.647 --> 00:08:03.858
[KNIGHT GUARDS chuckle, chatter]

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.528
[HANNIBAL] Okay, men.
Here're your assignments.

00:08:06.569 --> 00:08:08.655
Sir. May I ask you
a question first?

00:08:08.697 --> 00:08:10.031
[HANNIBAL]
What is it?

00:08:10.073 --> 00:08:12.492
I'm curious why you
chose Cecily Cambell

00:08:12.534 --> 00:08:15.203
to be protector of the
precious Demon Sword.

00:08:15.245 --> 00:08:18.540
Well, for one thing, she's
the head of the Cambell house.

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:22.460
And I happen to think she's
the right person for the job.

00:08:26.464 --> 00:08:28.425
[sighs]

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:31.177
So feel free to order as much
food as you want, okay?

00:08:31.219 --> 00:08:32.971
Don't worry, the tab's on me.

00:08:33.013 --> 00:08:34.639
[ARIA]
Mm! This is delicious!

00:08:34.681 --> 00:08:36.266
The sauce on this
meat is amazing!

00:08:36.307 --> 00:08:38.476
Three more orders of
roasted meat, please!

00:08:38.518 --> 00:08:40.478
Oh, yeah, and more
potato dumplings

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:41.980
and berries with honey!

00:08:42.022 --> 00:08:42.856
Lisa?

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.607
Huh? Well, uh...

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.194
Let's go ahead and make that
six more orders of meat, please!

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:51.031
Thanks a lot, but I don't
wanna take advantage.

00:08:51.072 --> 00:08:53.533
Oh, no. My boss said the
mayor will reimburse me

00:08:53.575 --> 00:08:55.702
for anything that
I spend on food.

00:08:55.744 --> 00:08:57.370
[ARIA]
That's very generous of him.

00:08:57.412 --> 00:08:59.414
It's probably because
I told Mayor Housman

00:08:59.456 --> 00:09:00.498
I like to go out to eat.

00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:01.791
[CECILY]
Well, I don't eat out much,

00:09:01.833 --> 00:09:04.002
so I wasn't sure where
to take you guys.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.337
Someone suggested this
place. Do you like?

00:09:06.379 --> 00:09:08.506
Are you kidding, this
place is wonderful!

00:09:08.548 --> 00:09:12.177
Delicious food, huge portions.
Best meal I've had in a while!

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.803
[LISA]
I completely agree!

00:09:13.845 --> 00:09:16.181
Every time we pass
this place I ask Luke

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.850
if we can eat here,
but he says no.

00:09:22.812 --> 00:09:26.066
Yum! I just can't get enough!

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.693
You might wanna slow down,
Lisa, or you're going to choke.

00:09:28.735 --> 00:09:30.904
I can handle it.

00:09:30.945 --> 00:09:33.490
Okay. Jeez, doesn't
that cheapskate Luke

00:09:33.531 --> 00:09:36.284
ever take you out
for a nice meal?

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.830
I was wondering.

00:09:40.872 --> 00:09:42.290
Are you two gonna
be at the festival

00:09:42.332 --> 00:09:43.792
that's happening next weekend?

00:09:43.833 --> 00:09:46.920
Yeah. Luke said we had
to go. What about you?

00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:49.923
Uh-huh. So you must be
real excited, huh?

00:09:49.964 --> 00:09:52.092
[LISA] Not so much.
We're not going for fun,

00:09:52.133 --> 00:09:55.178
we're going to check out
the sword vendors.

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:59.641
'Cause, see, Luke's been on the
lookout for a particular sword.

00:09:59.682 --> 00:10:01.559
[CECILY]
Oh, really. What kind?

00:10:01.601 --> 00:10:05.230
[sighs] Well, the kind
that can slay God.

00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:06.272
[CECILY, ARIA gasp]

00:10:06.314 --> 00:10:09.275
Uh. No wait! That wasn't
what I was trying to? say!

00:10:09.317 --> 00:10:11.903
I meant to say he's looking
for one that can slay cod!

00:10:11.945 --> 00:10:13.321
Luke would never
wanna do any harm

00:10:13.363 --> 00:10:18.284
to God or anything like that.
He just likes to eat fish.

00:10:18.326 --> 00:10:21.079
Uh. Sir, more potato
dumplings, and could I get

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:23.998
an order of chicken
and eggs, please?

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:26.417
Ooh, careful Lisa. Heh!

00:10:28.211 --> 00:10:31.256
[LUKE]
The Demon Sword of Wind. Aria.

Awaken. And slay God!

[LUKE] Huh. I wonder if
she's a-- Ah, who cares.

Lisa. Can you make me
some tea, I-- Damn it.

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:01.661
I have to say, I'm real
impressed with your city.

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:03.746
Everything seems to be
running like clockwork.

It's clean and peaceful
and it doesn't smell like death.

00:11:06.749 --> 00:11:08.042
Well, of course it doesn't.

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:10.753
Seriously, Aria, what
a weird thing to say.

It isn't unheard of for a

more corpses than living people.

00:11:19.888 --> 00:11:22.265
I've had many wielders.
And each one of them

00:11:22.307 --> 00:11:25.685
has showed me a
different way of life.

Thank you, pretty lady!

00:11:43.369 --> 00:11:45.580
Yeah, thank you!

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:51.669
Aria. Mind if I ask
how old you are?

00:11:51.711 --> 00:11:54.297
I'd say somewhere
between 40 and 50.

00:11:54.339 --> 00:11:55.673
Whoa.

00:11:55.715 --> 00:11:57.342
I'm not exactly sure.

00:11:57.383 --> 00:11:59.385
I remember waking up
on the battlefield

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:01.095
during the Valbanill War.

00:12:01.137 --> 00:12:04.265
I still have no idea
how I got there.

00:12:04.307 --> 00:12:06.768
When I awoke, I was
in my sword form.

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:09.729
I have no memories of
anything before that day.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:13.483
So I guess you could say
that's when I was "born."

[ARIA]
I am the Demon Sword of Wind.

00:12:33.169 --> 00:12:34.837
Once men realized my power,

00:12:34.879 --> 00:12:38.216
they started to kill one
another just to possess me.

[SOLDIER D chuckles]

00:12:42.136 --> 00:12:45.306

They acted like wild beasts.

00:12:45.348 --> 00:12:51.354
Many men were murdered because
of me, and I killed them all.

00:12:51.396 --> 00:12:54.440
Man, that's horrible.

00:12:54.482 --> 00:12:56.734
You've had such a hard life.

00:12:56.776 --> 00:12:59.821
[CECILY] Forced to kill from
the moment she was born.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:02.156
The cause of constant
bloodshed in the hands

00:13:02.198 --> 00:13:06.494
of greedy men.
I can't even imagine.

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:09.080
Sometimes I wonder.
Why am I here?

00:13:09.122 --> 00:13:10.456
What do you mean?

00:13:10.498 --> 00:13:12.500
I don't even know who I am.

00:13:12.542 --> 00:13:16.170
I mean, I know I'm a Demon
Sword--a tool used to fight.

00:13:16.212 --> 00:13:21.009
But still, who am I?
What is my purpose?

00:13:21.050 --> 00:13:22.969
Aria.

00:13:23.011 --> 00:13:26.306
Hey. I'm sorry, I'm not trying
to be such a downer.

00:13:26.347 --> 00:13:29.309
The point I was trying to make
is your city's amazing!

so that's sayin' somethin'.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:34.814
If I could, I would stay
here with you forever.

00:13:34.856 --> 00:13:36.274
Well, then, stay!

00:13:36.316 --> 00:13:39.277
Tell ya what, if you do, I'll be
your own personal bodyguard!

00:13:39.319 --> 00:13:42.780
Yeah, please stay! We'd
love it if you lived here!

00:13:44.282 --> 00:13:46.868

Uh?

So, has my new
sword come in yet?

[PATTY]
Yeah, let me get it.

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.078
It's a little smaller than the
traditional Knight Guard swords.

00:14:30.119 --> 00:14:33.915
That way it should be easier
for you to work with.

00:14:35.708 --> 00:14:38.628
[ARIA] Mm. That blade's got
an interesting shape.

00:14:38.669 --> 00:14:40.838
[LISA]
That's a false-edged sword!

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.924
Oh wow, you know your stuff.

00:14:42.965 --> 00:14:44.509
That false edge makes
it good for cutting

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:46.052
and since it's smaller, I should
have no problem thrusting--

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.054
[REGINALD]
That's a nice sword.

00:14:48.096 --> 00:14:49.555
But it's clearly
wasted on a knight

00:14:49.597 --> 00:14:51.307
who couldn't even kill a fly.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:53.851
Go to Hell, Reginald.

00:14:53.893 --> 00:14:55.561
Patty. Has my new sword come in?

00:14:55.603 --> 00:14:57.105
[PATTY]
Uh, yeah!

00:14:57.146 --> 00:14:59.107
Seriously, why are you
such a jerk to me?

00:14:59.148 --> 00:15:00.483
Rudeness was not my intent.

00:15:00.525 --> 00:15:02.985
I was merely pointing out
an established fact.

00:15:03.027 --> 00:15:05.405
But watching you swing
that little starter sword

00:15:05.446 --> 00:15:07.115
in battle should
be quite amusing.

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:09.242
Wow, this guy's
a real jerk, huh?

00:15:09.283 --> 00:15:11.953
Yeah. How can you work
with a meanie like him?

00:15:11.994 --> 00:15:15.456
[PATTY grunting]
Wow. That's heavy.

[REGINALD]
Thank you.

00:15:21.879 --> 00:15:27.760
The sword is a weapon
for dealing death.

00:15:27.802 --> 00:15:30.179
Its only purpose is
to kill the enemy.

00:15:30.221 --> 00:15:32.014
To lead your forces to victory.

00:15:32.056 --> 00:15:34.350
No. That's not their only use!

the same way that you do.

makes the man," right?

And?

You and my previous owner
have a lot in common.

00:20:30.813 --> 00:20:31.605
Luke.

00:20:31.647 --> 00:20:34.483
You have to kill him. Now!

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:37.737
I can't--he's still
a human being!

00:20:37.778 --> 00:20:39.113
[LUKE exhales]

00:20:39.155 --> 00:20:44.285
He's a person. I can't
kill him. I can't do it!

00:20:44.326 --> 00:20:45.453
You're kidding me.

00:20:45.494 --> 00:20:48.664
You're a knight and you've never
killed anybody before?

00:20:51.167 --> 00:20:52.376
[LUKE]
Damn it.

00:20:52.418 --> 00:20:55.421
[REGINALD] What the hell
are you doing, Cecily?

00:20:55.463 --> 00:20:57.631
Kill that man immediately!

00:20:58.632 --> 00:21:01.218
[REGINALD yells]

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:03.971
[CECILY grunts]

00:21:04.013 --> 00:21:06.140
[CECILY whimpers]

00:21:06.182 --> 00:21:07.933
What is wrong with you, coward?

00:21:07.975 --> 00:21:10.644
You don't deserve
to be a Knight Guard!

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:14.648
Miss Cecily.

00:21:14.690 --> 00:21:17.777
Reginald's right.
I am a coward.

00:21:17.818 --> 00:21:21.906
I'll never be a valiant knight
like my father and grandfather.

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:23.699
That's not true.

00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:29.455
[ARIA] You're just a different
kind of knight than they were.

00:21:29.497 --> 00:21:31.749
You're the nicest
person I've ever met.

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:33.417
I never imagined I
would meet a knight

00:21:33.459 --> 00:21:37.922
so concerned about others
that she's afraid to kill.

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:41.217
And I think that's
a lovely quality.

00:21:42.635 --> 00:21:44.428
Aria?

00:21:45.971 --> 00:21:52.353
[MAN A]
Where? Where is my salvation?

00:21:52.394 --> 00:21:55.314
[MAN IN BLACK] Forty-four years
ago you signed a Demon Contract,

00:21:55.356 --> 00:21:58.067
sacrificing yourself
to survive the war.

00:21:58.108 --> 00:22:03.030
You've proven your loyalty.
So you will have your salvation.

00:22:03.072 --> 00:22:04.782
You mean it?

00:22:04.824 --> 00:22:07.243
[MAN IN BLACK] In fact, I've
been looking for a man like you.

00:22:07.284 --> 00:22:10.371
I need a brave knight
to help carry out my plans.

00:22:10.412 --> 00:22:11.789
You're perfect for the job--

00:22:11.831 --> 00:22:15.918
a veteran of the war
with nothing to lose.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:19.129
I will give you your
salvation, friend.

00:22:19.171 --> 00:22:22.716
And all I ask for in
exchange is your soul.
