00:00:16.058 --> 00:00:17.100
Lisa!

00:00:17.142 --> 00:00:17.976
[LISA]

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:19.478
No!

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.191
[LUKE]
Lisa, are you okay?

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.567
Yeah, I'm fine.

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:26.860
[ELSA'S FATHER]
What's wrong with you?

00:00:26.902 --> 00:00:29.321
What the hell do you
think you're doing, Elsa?

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:30.239
[gasps]

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.492
[gasps] The enemy is
right in front of us!

00:00:33.534 --> 00:00:35.661
You mustn't betray me!

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.792
[ELSA'S FATHER]
Damn you!

00:00:41.833 --> 00:00:43.627
What the matter with him, Luke?

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:46.380
If I had to guess, I'd say
he'd signed a Demon Contract.

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:51.426
[ELSA'S FATHER pants, groans]

00:00:54.263 --> 00:00:55.764
So weak.

[LUKE gasps]

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.425
[CECILY] You were attacked
by a man with a Demon Sword?

00:02:55.467 --> 00:02:58.345
[LUKE] Yeah. It had the
power to control lightning.

00:02:58.387 --> 00:03:00.555
[CECILY]
Scary. Are you okay, Lisa?

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:02.015
Yeah.

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:03.517
Well, I'm glad to hear that.

00:03:03.558 --> 00:03:06.937
Now, wanna tell me why
you were attacked?

00:03:06.978 --> 00:03:09.064
Guess he was just
lookin' for a fight.

00:03:09.106 --> 00:03:13.151
I'm asking why he picked you!
'Cause no one'd wanna hurt Lisa!

[whimpers]

00:03:14.611 --> 00:03:16.697
[CECILY] Do you have any
idea who this guy was?

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:19.950
[LUKE] Not a clue.
It figures he'd attack my place.

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.993
It's where all the
idiot knights hang out.

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:23.829
[CECILY]
What did you say?

00:03:25.288 --> 00:03:26.873
[CECILY, LISA gasp]

00:03:26.915 --> 00:03:28.917
Store rule: you break it,
you buy it.

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:30.794
[CECILY grunts]
Ahem!

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:32.838
Let's focus on the matter
at hand, shall we?

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:35.257
We need to figure out
who our enemy is.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:36.591
[ARIA]
I think I have an idea.

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:38.093
[CECILY, LUKE, LISA]
Hm?

00:03:38.135 --> 00:03:41.346
I got a strange feeling
from someone yesterday.

00:03:41.388 --> 00:03:43.390
I passed a girl with
beautiful black hair.

00:03:43.432 --> 00:03:45.350
She seemed very soft-spoken.

00:03:45.392 --> 00:03:47.769
Wait a minute.
You don't mean Elsa?

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.897
She's just a customer I
brought over here for Luke.

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.108
No, that girl is a Demon Sword.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.234
[gasps]

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.569
[CECILY]
You can't be serious!

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.447
I'm sure of it. I knew
as soon as I saw her.

00:03:58.488 --> 00:03:59.781
[LUKE]
Huh?

00:03:59.823 --> 00:04:01.742
No. That can't be.

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.327
[ELSA'S FATHER] What the hell
do you think you're doing, Elsa?

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:06.705
So she's... just like you?

00:04:06.747 --> 00:04:09.082
Another sword capable
of taking human form?

00:04:09.124 --> 00:04:11.793
I had no idea there
were more of us.

00:04:11.835 --> 00:04:14.337
I don't understand,
even if she is a Demon Sword,

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:16.965
what reason would she
have to attack Luke?

00:04:17.007 --> 00:04:21.970
Prob'ly because... I'm the
so-called "Sacred Blacksmith".

00:04:22.012 --> 00:04:23.472
[LANCELOT]
I'm shocked to learn the Empire

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:25.307
tried to take the
blacksmith by force.

00:04:25.348 --> 00:04:27.225
That's a new low, even for you.

00:04:27.267 --> 00:04:28.477
What was that?

00:04:28.518 --> 00:04:29.978
Until the fugitives are caught,

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.023
we cannot be certain they
are citizens of the Empire.

00:04:33.064 --> 00:04:35.275
[AREVIY] Either way,
we must remain on alert.

00:04:35.317 --> 00:04:36.526
If he's been attacked once,

00:04:36.568 --> 00:04:38.862
there's a strong possibility
it'll happen again.

00:04:38.904 --> 00:04:41.406
[LANCELOT chuckles]
Everyone's after the blacksmith,

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:43.200
he's forging the Sacred Sword.

00:04:43.241 --> 00:04:45.327
It would certainly
appear that's the case.

00:04:45.368 --> 00:04:46.620
This could be a problem.

00:04:46.661 --> 00:04:48.914
If he's distracted, he may
not be able to forge it

00:04:48.955 --> 00:04:51.833
and we'll lose our trump
card against Valbanill.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:53.001
And if that were to happen,

00:04:53.043 --> 00:04:55.837
it would bring about the end
of the world as we know it.

00:04:55.879 --> 00:04:58.423
[JUSTINA] Over the past year,
the Sacred Sword,

00:04:58.465 --> 00:05:02.385
which is currently sealing
Valbanill has reached its limit.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:04.721
[HOUSMAN] And just as
Housman the First predicted,

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.141
the concentration of mana
has been on the rise lately.

00:05:08.183 --> 00:05:10.101
Mana? What the hell is that?

00:05:10.143 --> 00:05:12.270
There's no need to speak
in riddles, Housman,

00:05:12.312 --> 00:05:14.314
just lay it all out
on the table.

00:05:14.356 --> 00:05:15.315
He's right.

00:05:15.357 --> 00:05:17.859
We've avoided the
subject long enough.

00:05:17.901 --> 00:05:20.278
Tell them about
Valbanill's curse.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.072
[CECILY] "Curse"?
What's that supposed to mean?

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:24.449
As you know, we use
Prayer Contracts every day

00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:27.619
to improve our lives, and those
contracts create energy.

00:05:27.661 --> 00:05:30.914
We call that energy mana,
but it's basically just a curse.

00:05:30.956 --> 00:05:33.959
No way! We've always been taught
mana is important in maintaining

00:05:33.959 --> 00:05:37.379
our way of life, you're telling
me that's not true?

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.714
[LUKE] Housman the First
was a very clever man.

00:05:39.756 --> 00:05:41.967
He assimilated the use
of mana into daily life

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.469
so no one would suspect
its dark nature.

00:05:44.511 --> 00:05:46.596
And no one's ever questioned it.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.266
But, Prayer Contracts
are Demon Contracts

00:05:49.307 --> 00:05:51.059
that don't require human flesh.

00:05:51.101 --> 00:05:52.102
[CECILY gasps]

00:05:52.143 --> 00:05:53.812
What Housman the First
didn't know is it was

00:05:53.854 --> 00:05:55.522
all part of Valbanill's plan.

00:05:55.564 --> 00:05:57.440
Though he was sealed
by the Sacred Sword,

00:05:57.482 --> 00:05:59.150
he could still
exact his revenge.

00:05:59.192 --> 00:06:00.902
[LANCELOT] He knew the
human race was weak,

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:04.072
that one day we'd start
fighting amongst ourselves.

00:06:04.114 --> 00:06:05.907
[AREVIY] It is said that
Valbanill was the one who

00:06:05.949 --> 00:06:08.910
carved the Death Songs onto the
hearts of every human being.

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.120
[LANCELOT]
That's right.

00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:12.873
[ARTHUR] And of course, we began
signing Demon Contracts,

00:06:12.914 --> 00:06:15.959
causing the ugliest
war in human history.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.669
But we realized our mistakes.

00:06:17.711 --> 00:06:19.671
And though we were on
the brink of extinction,

00:06:19.713 --> 00:06:21.339
we somehow recovered.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.633
But if Valbanill were
to escape today,

00:06:23.675 --> 00:06:26.219
Demon Contracts would be
the least of our worries.

00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:29.347
That monster is determined to
use his power to eliminate

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.725
the human race!

00:06:31.766 --> 00:06:34.477
The only way to stop him is
with a new Sacred Sword.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:36.104
When will it be completed?

00:06:36.146 --> 00:06:37.188
I have no clue.

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.150
[CECILY] But Luke, you're
running out of time, aren't you?

00:06:40.191 --> 00:06:43.528
Yeah, but something's missing.
I can't put my finger on.

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.655
It's not an easy job
I have before me.

00:06:45.697 --> 00:06:47.282
Somehow I need to forge a sword

00:06:47.324 --> 00:06:50.452
that'll be able to seal
away Valbanill forever.

00:06:50.493 --> 00:06:52.537
That monster killed
Lisa Oakwood.

00:06:52.579 --> 00:06:55.206
And he killed my father.

00:06:55.248 --> 00:06:57.876
Whether my hatred is
not strong enough,

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.253
or my technique is
not good enough,

00:07:00.295 --> 00:07:02.297
either way it's disgraceful.

00:07:04.341 --> 00:07:08.219
[LISA gasps]

00:07:21.816 --> 00:07:24.903
[CECILY] Maybe you're failing
because you're not as angry

00:07:24.945 --> 00:07:27.197
with Valbanill as
you'd have us think.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:30.408
You're more angry
with someone else.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.952
[AREVIY]
We all know a Sacred Sword

00:07:31.993 --> 00:07:33.995
is needed to seal
Valbanill away.

00:07:34.037 --> 00:07:36.081
However, what if I told
you the blacksmith

00:07:36.122 --> 00:07:39.918
wasn't the only person
who could forge one? Hm?

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:41.878
Then what are we waiting for?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:46.132
[JUSTINA] It's magnificent!
What beautiful craftsmanship!

00:07:46.174 --> 00:07:47.008
[SIEGFRIED]
Hmph.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.135
Impressive.

00:07:49.177 --> 00:07:51.721
[ARTHUR]
Huh? Siegfried!

00:07:51.763 --> 00:07:53.848
Where the hell you
think you're going?

00:07:56.434 --> 00:07:57.686
Tsk.

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:14.953
[CHILDREN laughing]

00:08:18.999 --> 00:08:20.250
[FRANCESCA]
They have a Sacred Sword?

00:08:20.291 --> 00:08:22.127
It's not strong enough
to seal Valbanill,

00:08:22.168 --> 00:08:24.254
it wasn't forged
by the blacksmith.

00:08:24.295 --> 00:08:26.214
Though, from what I can tell,

00:08:26.256 --> 00:08:28.258
it's made of
high-grade tamahagane.

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:31.845
I suppose it could stand up
to a Demon Sword in battle.

00:08:31.886 --> 00:08:35.932
I see. So the problem is
Luke Ainsworth, after all.

00:08:39.352 --> 00:08:41.938
Just thinking aloud, sir.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:46.484
Do you mind if I ask about
what we discussed earlier?

00:08:46.526 --> 00:08:47.569
Ask away.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.615
[LISA, LUKE grunting]

00:09:06.921 --> 00:09:08.882
[CECILY]
This makes me so angry!

00:09:08.923 --> 00:09:10.133
[ARIA]
What makes you so angry?

00:09:10.175 --> 00:09:11.593
I'm mad at myself!

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:14.054
How could I not have
known any of that stuff?

00:09:14.095 --> 00:09:16.556
About the Sacred Sword,
Valbanill's curse?

00:09:16.598 --> 00:09:18.975
Luke never told me anything.

00:09:19.017 --> 00:09:21.728
And that makes me angry
with Luke for not telling me!

00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.688

supposed to be friends?

I just wish he could understand.

00:09:29.319 --> 00:09:31.237
He doesn't have to
bear that burden alone

00:09:31.279 --> 00:09:32.989
because I'm here for him.

00:09:33.031 --> 00:09:36.159
If we're such good friends,
why won't he accept my help?

00:09:36.201 --> 00:09:38.620
Does he think I'm not
worthy of his trust?

00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:41.247
I've done nothing but stand
by his side offering to help,

There are things in this

But Aria.

00:09:57.764 --> 00:10:00.391
[ARIA] Once you know those
things, there's no going back.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:02.435
You can never forget them.

Next thing you know, you've been
dragged into something terrible.

00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:08.191
Trust me, it's better
not knowing.

00:10:08.233 --> 00:10:11.277
Because if you
can't deal with it,

00:10:11.319 --> 00:10:13.905
you can't stand by
his side anymore.

00:10:13.947 --> 00:10:15.573

00:10:17.117 --> 00:10:19.202
Just give it some thought, okay?

[sighs]

00:10:31.881 --> 00:10:33.299
[PHARMACIST]
Okay, here are the pain killers

00:10:33.341 --> 00:10:35.260
and sleeping pills you ordered.

00:10:35.301 --> 00:10:37.720
Careful, taking them
together can be poisonous.

00:10:37.762 --> 00:10:41.099
[ELSA] I'll be careful.
Thank you very much ma'am.

00:10:44.352 --> 00:10:45.687
[YOUNG GIRL] Hey, Daddy,
what do you wanna have

00:10:45.728 --> 00:10:46.771
for dinner tonight?

00:10:46.813 --> 00:10:49.440
[FATHER] I dunno.
What do you want, sweetie?

00:10:49.482 --> 00:10:51.484
[ARIA] I'll take some pork.
And a chicken too!

00:10:51.526 --> 00:10:54.028
Stocking up, huh? You sure
are buying a lot today!

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:56.156
[ARIA] Cecily's been kind
of down, so I figured a nice,

00:10:56.197 --> 00:10:57.615
meaty dinner would
cheer her up.

00:10:57.657 --> 00:10:59.742
'Ey, I like the way you think!

00:10:59.784 --> 00:11:01.536
Tell ya what,
how 'bout half price?

00:11:01.578 --> 00:11:04.664
Wow! Awesome! Thanks so much!

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:09.836
[ARIA]
Her again.

00:11:11.629 --> 00:11:13.256
[ARIA] There's no need
to be nervous.

00:11:13.298 --> 00:11:14.424
We're both Demon Swords,

00:11:14.465 --> 00:11:17.468
I just wanted to get the chance
to talk to you a little bit.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:22.891
It's not like there are too many
of us out there, you know?

00:11:22.932 --> 00:11:24.934
And there some things
I can't really talk about

00:11:24.976 --> 00:11:26.561
with just anybody.

00:11:26.603 --> 00:11:28.897
Yeah, I guess.

00:11:28.938 --> 00:11:30.899
I want to know why we exist.

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.233
[ELSA gasps]

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:35.236
[ARIA] I want to know why
swords like us were created.

00:11:35.278 --> 00:11:37.530
I mean, if our only
purpose is killing,

00:11:37.572 --> 00:11:40.909
then we'd only need
a sword form, right?

00:11:40.950 --> 00:11:42.952
But for some reason,
we're different.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:45.663
[ELSA] We may be swords,
but we're also human.

00:11:45.705 --> 00:11:48.208
Not quite.

00:11:48.249 --> 00:11:50.585
We're not really swords,
and we're not human.

00:11:50.627 --> 00:11:51.836
We're demons.

00:11:51.878 --> 00:11:54.839
Forced to wander
with no real direction.

00:11:55.882 --> 00:11:58.343
With no family. No home.

00:11:59.469 --> 00:12:02.263
[ARIA] Even though I've finally
found a place I belong,

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:04.766
I know I'll have to
leave them one day.

00:12:04.807 --> 00:12:07.852
I don't want to be tormented
by these thoughts anymore,

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.146
but they consume me.

00:12:10.188 --> 00:12:11.981
At this point I need to know.

00:12:12.023 --> 00:12:13.691
Where did the Demon
Swords come from?

00:12:13.733 --> 00:12:15.318
Why are we here?

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.446
I mean, why were we even
created in the first place?

00:12:19.614 --> 00:12:21.908
[ELSA] You're sure you
wanna know these things?

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:23.660
[ARIA]
Yes.

00:12:23.701 --> 00:12:27.789
Demon Swords are beings created
from an outpouring of hatred.

00:12:27.830 --> 00:12:29.165
[ARIA]
Hatred?

00:12:29.207 --> 00:12:31.167
[ELSA] We were born the
same way most demons are,

00:12:31.209 --> 00:12:33.544
the signing of a Demon Contract.

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:36.965
But the difference is we were
created solely for vengeance.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.800
Our creators signed
Demon Contracts

00:12:38.841 --> 00:12:41.386
out of hatred for Valbanill.

00:12:41.427 --> 00:12:45.974
And killing him is the
only reason we exist.

00:12:46.015 --> 00:12:49.269
No, Elsa, that's impossible.
How could that be?

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:52.855
[ELSA] We were born out of hate
and that hate remains within us,

00:12:52.897 --> 00:12:54.399
driving us to kill.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.609
Our creators were
blinded by their pain.

00:12:56.651 --> 00:12:59.654
They didn't realize the
damage they'd done.

00:12:59.696 --> 00:13:03.074
Haven't you ever wondered
about our incantation?

00:13:03.116 --> 00:13:07.620
Awaken... and slay God.

00:13:18.131 --> 00:13:20.216
[CECILY]
Yeah, so? How did it turn out?

00:13:20.258 --> 00:13:21.968
[LUKE] Well, it's better
than the last one.

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:24.721
But I'm not sure it'll hold up
against a Demon Sword.

00:13:24.762 --> 00:13:27.598
What if you did that weird
chanty thing again?

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:29.475
[LUKE]
You mean the Forging Spell?

00:13:29.517 --> 00:13:30.476
[CECILY]
Yeah, that.

00:13:30.518 --> 00:13:32.562
I can't do it without Lisa.

00:13:32.603 --> 00:13:35.398
And she can't be there,
I refuse to put her in danger.

00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.984
[CECILY]
Gotcha. That makes sense.

00:13:38.026 --> 00:13:40.194
[ARIA] If your master wants
to take revenge on Valbanill,

00:13:40.236 --> 00:13:41.988
why did he have you
attack my friends?

00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:43.531
[ELSA gasps]

00:13:43.573 --> 00:13:45.408
Please, you have to tell me!

00:13:45.450 --> 00:13:47.160
[ELSA]
He's old and easily confused,

00:13:47.201 --> 00:13:49.245
but I have to follow his orders.

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:51.456
At least until I can
finally carry out

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:54.542
my mission to bring him peace.

00:13:54.584 --> 00:13:57.754
[ARIA] Elsa, I don't want to
have to fight against you.

00:13:59.839 --> 00:14:01.716
[ELSA'S FATHER coughs]

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:05.219
What's the matter, sir?
Are you feeling all right?

00:14:05.261 --> 00:14:08.514
Soon I'll be able to
avenge my Elsa's death.

00:14:08.556 --> 00:14:10.725
You have to stop pushing
yourself so hard.

00:14:10.767 --> 00:14:11.934
What are you saying?

00:14:11.976 --> 00:14:14.437
If you keep this up
I'm afraid you'll die,

00:14:14.479 --> 00:14:16.022
and I don't want that to happen.

00:14:16.064 --> 00:14:19.025
[SIEGFRIED]
That would be problematic.

00:14:19.067 --> 00:14:20.860
It would be a shame
to give up now.

00:14:20.902 --> 00:14:22.945
[ELSA'S FATHER gasps]
It's you!

00:14:22.987 --> 00:14:27.283
Thanks to you, I will have
my revenge on Valbanill!

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.785
It's been so long.

00:14:28.826 --> 00:14:31.662
My wish is finally
about to come true!

00:14:31.704 --> 00:14:34.207
[SIEGFRIED] Wonderful.
I may not be much help,

00:14:34.248 --> 00:14:36.626

to fight at your side.

00:14:36.667 --> 00:14:39.670
[ELSA'S FATHER gasps]
I would be honored.

00:14:50.848 --> 00:14:54.268
Protect Lisa for me.

you get past me, old man!

I will be your opponent tonight.
Don't let me down, blacksmith.

It's the Man in Black!

00:15:22.338 --> 00:15:23.631

Hunting down a little girl?

How dare you call
yourself a knight?

00:19:08.522 --> 00:19:10.274
Don't you see how
serious this is,

00:19:10.316 --> 00:19:12.610
everyone here
could end up dead!

00:19:12.652 --> 00:19:15.863
I'm simply following
my master's orders.

00:19:15.905 --> 00:19:17.865
[ARIA gasps]
Elsa, wait!

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:24.080
[ELSA'S FATHER groans]

00:19:24.121 --> 00:19:25.331
[LISA, CECILY gasp]

00:19:27.708 --> 00:19:29.335
Elsa!

00:19:29.377 --> 00:19:30.586
[gasps]

00:19:34.799 --> 00:19:38.052
[gasps]

00:19:38.594 --> 00:19:40.763
Oh, no! She's been hurt!

00:19:40.805 --> 00:19:42.223
[ARIA gasps]

00:19:42.264 --> 00:19:45.559
[ELSA'S FATHER grunts]
My beloved daughter.

00:19:45.601 --> 00:19:47.603
Where are you, Elsa?

00:19:47.645 --> 00:19:51.107
I'm here, I'm right
in front of you.

00:19:51.148 --> 00:19:56.570
[ELSA'S FATHER] Heh. It's time.
Save me from this pain.

00:19:56.612 --> 00:19:57.822
Sir.

00:20:05.663 --> 00:20:07.206
[ELSA'S FATHER groans]

00:20:10.751 --> 00:20:13.379
[gasps]

00:20:13.421 --> 00:20:16.382
Elsa...

00:20:27.351 --> 00:20:29.353
Goodbye, Father.

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.564
[LISA, ARIA, CECILY gasp]

00:20:33.232 --> 00:20:34.442
[LISA whimpers]

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:41.824
Poor Elsa.

00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:44.034
She's waited patiently
for so long.

00:20:44.076 --> 00:20:45.244
They're finally at peace.

00:20:45.286 --> 00:20:46.912
[LISA gasps]

00:20:51.959 --> 00:20:54.837
[SIEGFRIED] Heh. I thought the
old man would last longer.

00:20:54.879 --> 00:20:56.255
I suppose he served his purpose.

00:20:56.297 --> 00:20:57.506
[LUKE]
Damn you!

00:20:57.548 --> 00:20:58.758
[CECILY]
Why did this happen?

00:20:58.799 --> 00:21:01.135
The two of them
didn't have to die!

00:21:01.177 --> 00:21:04.764
nfortunately, death is the
fate of all Demon Swords.

00:21:04.805 --> 00:21:07.308
Just ask the
Demon Sword of Wind.

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:10.019
What're you saying?

00:21:10.060 --> 00:21:11.562
[SIEGFRIED] They were
created to take vengeance

00:21:11.604 --> 00:21:13.439
against the god, Valbanill.

00:21:13.481 --> 00:21:17.067
They live for the sole
purpose of taking his life.

00:21:17.109 --> 00:21:18.027
[CECILY]
Valbanill?

00:21:18.068 --> 00:21:20.237
You'd best prepare
yourself, young lady.

00:21:20.279 --> 00:21:21.572
The day will come when yours

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.407
will want to kill
the girl as well.

00:21:23.449 --> 00:21:25.826
That would never happen!

00:21:25.868 --> 00:21:28.829
[SIEGFRIED] You mean no one's
told you about your friend?

00:21:28.871 --> 00:21:31.624
This being you call "Lisa"
has the blood of Valbanill

00:21:31.665 --> 00:21:33.167
running through her veins.

00:21:33.209 --> 00:21:34.960
[gasps]

00:21:35.002 --> 00:21:37.505
[CECILY gasps]
No, that's impossible!

00:21:37.546 --> 00:21:39.715
[SIEGFRIED]
You see, Lisa is a demon.

00:21:39.757 --> 00:21:42.468
Three years ago, when Luke faced
Valbanill's wrath he signed

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.889
a Demon Contract, killing his
friend to save his own life.

00:21:46.931 --> 00:21:48.933
That's how this Lisa was born.

00:21:48.974 --> 00:21:51.101
Shut up!

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.812
[chuckles]

00:21:52.853 --> 00:21:54.396
I'll kill you!

00:21:58.567 --> 00:22:00.528
[LISA, ARIA, CECILY gasp]

00:22:00.569 --> 00:22:02.863
[SIEGFRIED laughs]

00:22:04.323 --> 00:22:05.699
[LUKE grunts]

00:22:05.741 --> 00:22:09.161
[CECILY gasps] Luke. What he
said isn't true, is it?

00:22:09.203 --> 00:22:12.623
He was lying. Please tell
me he was lying.

00:22:12.665 --> 00:22:17.086
[LUKE] No, he's telling
the truth. Sorry.

00:22:17.127 --> 00:22:19.338
I didn't have the
heart to tell you.

00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:23.425
[CECILY gasps]
