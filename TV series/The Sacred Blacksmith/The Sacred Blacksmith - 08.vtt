00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.345
"Dear Mayor Housman,
I regret to inform you

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.598
I have no descendant with the
name Charlotte E. Firobisher."

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.519
He's... denied me.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.229
It can't be...

00:00:21.772 --> 00:00:23.065
Princess Charlotte!

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:26.151
How could he do that?
I don't understand.

00:00:26.193 --> 00:00:29.321
Why would my father
choose to deny his daughter?

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.823
Now my mother's wish
will never be granted.

00:00:31.865 --> 00:00:33.700
It's all his fault!

00:00:33.742 --> 00:00:35.869
What'll I do now?!

00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:40.082
[sobbing]

00:00:40.123 --> 00:00:42.292
I'm so sorry, Charlotte...

00:02:18.055 --> 00:02:21.224
[sobbing]

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:23.727
Isn't there anything
we can do, Mayor Housman?

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:24.978
[HOUSMAN]
I'm afraid not.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.397
He's requested that
we turn the girls in to him.

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.900
If we don't comply, our
relationship with the Empire

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.026
could fall to pieces.

00:02:31.068 --> 00:02:32.527
[gasping]

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.570
We can't do that!

00:02:33.612 --> 00:02:36.573
If we turn them over to him,
they'll be severely punished!

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:37.699
No matter what he says,

00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:39.993
I believe Charlotte is the
Emperor's daughter.

00:02:40.035 --> 00:02:42.621
For whatever reason, they're
trying to deny her legitimacy--

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.623
they're in the wrong here, sir!

00:02:44.665 --> 00:02:47.209
Listen, Cambell, we're not
saying we side with the Emperor,

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.628
we're simply saying we have
to comply with his orders.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.629
But why, sir?

00:02:50.671 --> 00:02:53.340
Why can't we just refuse
to hand them over to him?

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:55.092
We can keep Charlotte safe here.

00:02:55.133 --> 00:02:57.135
The Knight Guards
can protect her!

00:02:57.177 --> 00:02:59.388
I'm truly sorry,
but I cannot allow that.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.515
Give me one good reason why.

00:03:01.556 --> 00:03:03.767
The Emperor has labeled
these girls as criminals

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:05.811
and is demanding their arrest.

00:03:05.852 --> 00:03:07.938
If I refuse and decide
to harbor them here,

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:10.482
I have no doubt
he'll attack our city.

00:03:10.524 --> 00:03:13.276
Well, maybe so, but that's
a risk we should be

00:03:13.318 --> 00:03:15.737
willing to take in
order to save them!

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.698
Cambell! That's enough!

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.950
This is a delicate
political situation;

00:03:19.991 --> 00:03:21.201
you wouldn't understand.

00:03:21.243 --> 00:03:22.369
[CECILY]
But Captain!

00:03:22.411 --> 00:03:24.079
If we're not careful,
this could cause us

00:03:24.121 --> 00:03:25.539
to go to war with the Empire!

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.500
--[gasps]
--It's serious business.

00:03:35.298 --> 00:03:38.176
No, I refuse to give up.
Hey, Aria.

00:03:38.218 --> 00:03:40.971
Do you remember the day
I fought Jack Strader?

00:03:41.012 --> 00:03:43.348
And what I vowed to do
from that day forward?

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:46.059
Yes. I remember it very clearly.

00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:48.353
You vowed to protect everyone!

00:03:49.396 --> 00:03:52.065
If you won't
protect them, I will!

00:03:56.069 --> 00:03:57.487
[LUCY]
What's the matter, Charlotte?

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.824
You haven't even touched your
dinner. Do you not like it?

00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.826
I don't have much
of an appetite.

00:04:02.868 --> 00:04:04.661
Aw, c'mon, Princess! Cheer up!

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:07.622
Try some of this meat!
I promise you'll love it!

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.040
Excuse me.

00:04:09.082 --> 00:04:10.917
Charlotte, dear.

00:04:12.419 --> 00:04:14.254
Wait! Princess!

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.680
[CHARLOTTE sobbing]

00:04:23.722 --> 00:04:24.765
[DORIS]
Please don't cry.

00:04:24.806 --> 00:04:26.683
I'm sure this was all
just a misunderstanding.

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:27.809
[MARGOT]
Doris is right.

00:04:27.851 --> 00:04:29.519
The Emperor would
never purposefully hurt

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:31.438
his own daughter.

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.565
[PENELOPE] We're going
to protect you, Princess.

00:04:33.607 --> 00:04:36.985
There's no need for you
to worry about anything, okay?

00:04:37.027 --> 00:04:39.196
Don't cry. We hate
to see you upset.

00:04:39.237 --> 00:04:42.949
[sobbing continues]

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.957
[grunts]

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.215
[DORIS] Come on, Cecily!
That's pathetic!

00:04:58.256 --> 00:05:00.383
We haven't even gotten
to any tough training yet.

00:05:00.425 --> 00:05:01.676
I don't know how
you're gonna cut it

00:05:01.718 --> 00:05:04.846
if you can't even make it
through the basics.

00:05:04.888 --> 00:05:07.307
So you're telling me
you do this stuff every day?

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.018
Yeah, dummy! I need strength.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.312
Or else I can't protect
the people I care about.

00:05:12.354 --> 00:05:16.233
Doris! Check it out!
I found an egg!

00:05:16.274 --> 00:05:18.109
This'll make Princess
Charlotte feel better,

00:05:18.151 --> 00:05:19.528
you know how she loves 'em!

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:21.780
And the protein in it
will give her energy!

00:05:21.822 --> 00:05:23.949
Nice! I'm gonna find more!

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.159
One chicken can only lay
so many eggs, Doris!

00:05:26.201 --> 00:05:28.119
[DORIS] You can do anything
you set your mind to!

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.830
--Anything!
--Wait! Doris!

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:33.166
Cut it out! What're you
gonna do to my chicken?

00:05:33.208 --> 00:05:35.502
"I also request extradition
of the impostors,

00:05:35.544 --> 00:05:38.004
as they've earned
the wrath of the Empire."

00:05:38.046 --> 00:05:39.548
[gasps]

00:05:57.941 --> 00:06:00.026
Defect to the Garrison State?

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:02.904
[HOUSMAN] I'm afraid that's
the only option we have left.

00:06:02.946 --> 00:06:04.823
[HANNIBAL] The leaders of the
Garrison State said they would

00:06:04.865 --> 00:06:06.575
harbor you there
without question.

00:06:06.616 --> 00:06:07.951
Never. We're not doing that!

00:06:07.993 --> 00:06:10.245
We don't know anything
about the Garrison State!

00:06:10.287 --> 00:06:12.914
And we don't wanna leave
this city. We're happy here!

00:06:12.956 --> 00:06:15.041
As I have told you girls before,

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.960
I will not risk my
city's safety for you.

00:06:17.002 --> 00:06:18.336
[gasping]

00:06:19.963 --> 00:06:21.506
Captain, it doesn't
seem fair that we're

00:06:21.548 --> 00:06:23.008
forcing them to defect!

00:06:23.049 --> 00:06:25.093
There has to be some
other way we can help them!

00:06:25.135 --> 00:06:27.846
--We've run out of time, Cecily.
--[CECILY] But sir--

00:06:27.888 --> 00:06:30.348
[HANNIBAL] The Empire has
already mobilized their army.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:33.476
In fact, they're sitting outside
the city gates right now.

00:06:33.518 --> 00:06:36.479
It may just be for show or
an attempt at intimidation,

00:06:36.521 --> 00:06:39.024
but they're positioned to
attack at any moment.

00:06:39.065 --> 00:06:40.525
[HOUSMAN]
I hope you understand.

00:06:40.567 --> 00:06:42.319
We mustn't give them
reason to attack.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.905
The Empire's army is
much stronger than ours.

00:06:44.946 --> 00:06:45.947
[CECILY grunts]

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.782
[HOUSMAN] The plan is to return
the four Demon Swords

00:06:47.824 --> 00:06:49.951
to the forces waiting outside,

00:06:49.993 --> 00:06:51.745
but we'll tell them
you fled the city.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:54.039
Hopefully, that will give
you ladies a head start.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:55.498
But what'll happen
if they find out

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:57.584
you actually let us leave, sir?

00:06:57.626 --> 00:06:59.961
Well, the Emperor won't be
very pleased with us.

00:07:00.003 --> 00:07:02.047
But don't worry about
that now, little lady.

00:07:02.088 --> 00:07:04.716
Let's deal with the more
immediate problem first.

00:07:04.758 --> 00:07:08.386
When the time comes, the Knight
Guards will be ready for him.

00:07:09.304 --> 00:07:11.097
I'm afraid defecting
to the Garrison State

00:07:11.139 --> 00:07:14.684
is the best option I can
give you at this time.

00:07:14.726 --> 00:07:16.895
I doubt they're gonna just
take us in without a price.

00:07:16.937 --> 00:07:19.230
They must want
something in return.

00:07:19.272 --> 00:07:22.108
[HOUSMAN] Yes. In exchange for
letting you enter their nation

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.445
as fugitives, they ask that
you share all information

00:07:25.487 --> 00:07:26.780
you may have on the Empire.

00:07:26.821 --> 00:07:27.781
[gasping]

00:07:27.822 --> 00:07:31.284
I can't do that. How could I?

00:07:31.326 --> 00:07:33.161
The Empire is my homeland.

00:07:33.203 --> 00:07:35.789
The nation my mother
was so proud of.

00:07:37.749 --> 00:07:39.042
I am sorry.

00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:41.086
[CHARLOTTE whimpering]

00:07:43.171 --> 00:07:44.756
I can't do it...

00:07:44.798 --> 00:07:46.257
Please, Charlotte...

00:07:46.299 --> 00:07:48.385
[CHARLOTTE] I thought you were
on our side, Cecily.

00:07:48.426 --> 00:07:50.512
Are you betraying us?

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:52.305
No. That's not it.

00:07:52.347 --> 00:07:54.683
Our sole purpose for coming
here was to be able to return

00:07:54.724 --> 00:07:56.101
to the Empire someday.

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:59.521
[ARIA] I realize that, but going
back isn't an option anymore.

00:07:59.562 --> 00:08:01.815
[gasping]

00:08:01.856 --> 00:08:04.985
Okay? But why can't we
just stay here forever?

00:08:05.026 --> 00:08:08.905
Like the Mayor said, if you
stay, the Empire will attack us.

00:08:08.947 --> 00:08:11.282
It's not fair to make Cecily
choose between your lives

00:08:11.324 --> 00:08:13.535
and the lives of
Housman's citizens.

00:08:13.576 --> 00:08:15.328
You have to leave.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:17.831
It's the only way you're
guaranteed to survive,

00:08:17.872 --> 00:08:19.958
and I don't want
to lose any of you.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:21.084
[CHARLOTTE]
What kind of life is that?

00:08:21.126 --> 00:08:22.335
[gasps]

00:08:22.377 --> 00:08:24.170
You're asking me to give up
on my mother's wish

00:08:24.212 --> 00:08:25.880
and sell out my homeland.

00:08:25.922 --> 00:08:29.801
All this just so my miserable
life might last a little longer?

00:08:29.843 --> 00:08:32.095
Don't you see what
you're asking of me?

00:08:32.137 --> 00:08:33.179
But Charlotte...

00:08:33.221 --> 00:08:35.181
[DORIS]
I've heard enough outta you!

00:08:35.223 --> 00:08:37.308
You know how happy Princess
Charlotte has been here,

00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.893
and you're going to
force her to leave?

00:08:38.935 --> 00:08:41.813
She would be miserable
in the Garrison State!

00:08:41.855 --> 00:08:45.191
Let's go. They can't help us.

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.152
Charlotte, wait!

00:08:58.455 --> 00:09:00.915
[LISA]
I feel so bad for them.

00:09:00.957 --> 00:09:03.918
Now they're lost
without anywhere to go.

00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.212
I can certainly relate
to that feeling.

00:09:06.254 --> 00:09:09.007
If only they could see. If they
don't go to the Garrison State,

00:09:09.049 --> 00:09:10.216
they could end up dead.

00:09:10.258 --> 00:09:13.970
I know it's not the best option,
but at least it's something.

00:09:14.012 --> 00:09:15.180
[LUKE]
No, I get it.

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:16.347
What do you mean?

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.183
[LUKE] Just think about it.
What good is living

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.185
if you don't have
anything to live for?

00:09:20.226 --> 00:09:21.895
Can you really blame them
for running away?

00:09:21.936 --> 00:09:24.105
[CECILY]
But now they're in danger.

00:09:24.147 --> 00:09:26.941
I'd rather lose my life
than give up on my dreams.

00:09:26.983 --> 00:09:29.152
Then all you can do is
wait for death to come.

00:09:29.194 --> 00:09:30.737
Is that what you want for them?

00:09:30.779 --> 00:09:33.907
No! What I want is to
find them a peaceful place

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:36.117
where they can
all just live happily.

00:09:36.159 --> 00:09:37.869
If you could have seen them.

00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:40.538
Eating together,
laughing together...

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:42.207
They were content.

00:09:42.248 --> 00:09:46.044
But now... It's not safe for
them to stay in Housman anymore.

00:09:46.086 --> 00:09:48.755
They can't go back to the
Empire, and I understand why

00:09:48.797 --> 00:09:52.801
they don't want to go to
the Garrison State either.

00:09:52.842 --> 00:09:54.344
[LISA]
Maybe I'm weird,

00:09:54.385 --> 00:09:56.638
but I'd be happy anywhere
if you three were with me.

00:09:56.679 --> 00:09:58.515
I don't think it matters
where you end up as long

00:09:58.556 --> 00:10:01.518
as you're with the people
you care about most.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.645
I mean, as long as we can
have tea together everyday,

00:10:03.686 --> 00:10:06.648
we could be on the other
side of the world.

00:10:06.689 --> 00:10:08.274
Does that make sense?

00:10:08.316 --> 00:10:11.611
You're absolutely right.
Thank you, Lisa!

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:15.240
The answer to all their problems
is right in front of them!

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.534
[LUKE]
You think they can be convinced?

00:10:17.575 --> 00:10:19.410
Yes, I'm sure they can!

00:10:19.452 --> 00:10:21.246
[LUKE]
Well, you'd better hurry.

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.165
People are known to do stupid
things when they feel like

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.918
they're backed into a corner.
Please be careful.

00:10:32.215 --> 00:10:34.175
[MARGOT] If we can find
something valuable to take back

00:10:34.217 --> 00:10:36.469
to the Emperor,
I'm sure he'll reconsider.

00:10:36.511 --> 00:10:39.305
[PENELOPE] We could be sentenced
to death for this, you know.

00:10:39.347 --> 00:10:41.182
[DORIS] If that's the way
it's gotta be...

00:10:41.224 --> 00:10:43.143
...we have to do what
we can to try and change

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.811
the Emperor's mind.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:49.858
[GROUP] We must protect
Princess Charlotte!

00:10:56.239 --> 00:10:57.740
[LUCY]
That's strange.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.951
I thought Cecily would've
made it home by now.

00:10:59.993 --> 00:11:01.953
The other girls
aren't back either.

00:11:01.995 --> 00:11:03.788
Charlotte, I don't suppose
you know where everyone's

00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:05.665
run off to, do you?

00:11:06.916 --> 00:11:09.335
No, ma'am. I didn't
even know they were gone.

00:11:09.377 --> 00:11:11.296
I hope they're okay out there.

00:11:11.337 --> 00:11:13.548
I wouldn't wanna be
stuck in that storm!

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.055
You better hurry, Penelope!

00:11:21.097 --> 00:11:23.057
[PENELOPE]
Almost got it...

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.185
Someone's there!

00:11:26.644 --> 00:11:28.646
But that's impossible,
we knocked out all the guards

00:11:28.688 --> 00:11:30.106
on our way in!

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.443
[gasping]

00:11:33.484 --> 00:11:35.069
[DORIS]
Cecily?

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.623
[DORIS]
How'd you know where to find us?

00:11:46.664 --> 00:11:48.791
I guess you could
call it a hunch.

00:11:48.833 --> 00:11:51.169
Although I really wish
I had been wrong about it.

00:11:51.211 --> 00:11:52.879
It's not too late to stop.

00:11:52.921 --> 00:11:55.882
Come back to
the Cambell House with me.

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:57.717
I'm sorry, we can't do that.

00:11:57.759 --> 00:11:59.636
Not until we've
tried everything.

00:11:59.677 --> 00:12:02.513
We're gonna take Aria and
the Blacksmith to the Emperor.

00:12:02.555 --> 00:12:04.015
Once he sees how
valuable they are,

00:12:04.057 --> 00:12:06.392
he's sure to welcome
Princess Charlotte back.

00:12:06.434 --> 00:12:08.478
[CECILY] Does she even know
about this plan of yours?

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:10.813
It doesn't sound like something
Charlotte would approve of.

00:12:10.855 --> 00:12:11.898
[DORIS]
It doesn't matter!

00:12:11.940 --> 00:12:13.900
We can't stand her
being so upset.

00:12:13.942 --> 00:12:16.194
And we'll do anything
to see her happy again!

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:18.446
Well, breaking the law
isn't gonna help.

00:12:18.488 --> 00:12:22.158
If you're not gonna help,
just get out of our way!

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.952
There's nothing I can do.

00:12:25.078 --> 00:12:28.039
I'm powerless. Just like always.

00:12:29.749 --> 00:12:30.959
But now...

00:12:32.293 --> 00:12:33.628
...I couldn't care less!

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:36.005
[gasping]

00:12:36.047 --> 00:12:39.384
You can either leave
on your own or I can force you.

00:12:39.425 --> 00:12:41.261
[growling]

00:12:41.302 --> 00:12:45.223
Okay. Then you better
go get your Demon Swords.

00:12:45.265 --> 00:12:48.685
It won't be a fair fight if I
have mine and you all don't.

00:12:48.726 --> 00:12:50.436
What the hell
are you trying to prove?

00:12:50.478 --> 00:12:52.063
[CECILY]
I got no plan here.

00:12:52.105 --> 00:12:54.524
But if you choose to fight
against us, you might get hurt.

00:12:54.565 --> 00:12:56.276
You know we're much
stronger than you are.

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:57.694
[CECILY]
I'm sure you'll kick my ass.

00:12:57.735 --> 00:12:58.861
Then why?

00:12:58.903 --> 00:13:01.197
[CECILY]
You just don't get it, do you?

00:13:01.239 --> 00:13:03.449
I thought you would've
figured me out by now.

00:13:03.491 --> 00:13:05.868
I can be one crazy bitch!

00:13:15.962 --> 00:13:18.756
I won't go easy on ya.
Hope you're ready.

00:13:18.798 --> 00:13:20.133
Do your worst, Margot.

00:13:20.174 --> 00:13:22.051
But you're gonna have
to catch up to me first,

00:13:22.093 --> 00:13:24.012
'cause I can also be a coward!

00:13:24.053 --> 00:13:26.931
Nobody's fast enough
to outrun Rhomphaia!

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:35.857
Little wind won't hold me back!

00:13:35.898 --> 00:13:38.943
Oh, yeah?
Well, then how about this?

00:13:38.985 --> 00:13:40.028
[MARGOT grunts]

00:13:42.447 --> 00:13:43.865
[yells]

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:50.163
[groaning]

00:13:50.204 --> 00:13:53.207
Using Aria like a spear, the
blast shot right through you.

00:13:53.249 --> 00:13:55.460
Wonder who I learned
that trick from.

00:13:55.501 --> 00:13:56.919
No! Margot!

00:13:56.961 --> 00:13:58.421
[MARGOT grunts]

00:13:59.964 --> 00:14:01.883
How could you do that to her?!

00:14:01.924 --> 00:14:05.970
[grunting]

00:14:10.516 --> 00:14:11.976
--Hah!
--[CECILY groans]

00:14:13.686 --> 00:14:14.854
[grunts]

00:14:14.896 --> 00:14:17.857
There's no way you're ever gonna
beat me in hand to hand combat.

00:14:17.899 --> 00:14:19.609
You might as well surrender now.

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:22.612
[CECILY panting]

00:14:22.653 --> 00:14:25.323
Damn it, always gotta
do things the hard way!

00:14:30.912 --> 00:14:32.705
It's still pouring.

00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:35.833
[door creaks]

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.336
I went into town and checked
all their usual hang outs,

00:14:38.378 --> 00:14:40.213
but they were nowhere
to be found, ma'am.

00:14:40.254 --> 00:14:41.923
[LUCY] I wonder where
they could've gone?

00:14:41.964 --> 00:14:44.467
I did come across something
strange, our warehouse door

00:14:44.509 --> 00:14:47.553
was left open, and some of
the weapons are missing.

00:14:47.595 --> 00:14:48.638
[gasps]

00:14:48.679 --> 00:14:50.765
You don't think it
could've been a burglar?

00:14:52.183 --> 00:14:53.684
Charlotte, where are you going?

00:14:53.726 --> 00:14:56.270
[panting]

00:14:56.312 --> 00:14:59.190
Doris! Margot! Penelope!

00:14:59.232 --> 00:15:01.943
[thunder cracks]

00:15:09.784 --> 00:15:11.119
Yeah, nice try!

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:13.079
But your Demon Sword
is powerless against

00:15:13.121 --> 00:15:15.498
my bollock dagger!

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:17.250
[CECILY]
Oh, I'm well aware of that.

00:15:17.291 --> 00:15:20.044
However, this sword is
capable of a whole lot more

00:15:20.086 --> 00:15:22.130
than you'd think, Penelope!

00:15:24.257 --> 00:15:26.426
Let's go, Aria!

00:15:30.596 --> 00:15:31.639
No way!

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.475
[CECILY yelling]

00:15:38.563 --> 00:15:40.815
[PENELOPE groaning]

00:15:40.857 --> 00:15:43.776
[CECILY] I knew I couldn't beat
you in hand to hand combat.

00:15:43.818 --> 00:15:44.986
[PENELOPE groans]

00:15:45.027 --> 00:15:46.571
[CECILY] And I couldn't
attack with Aria's

00:15:46.612 --> 00:15:48.698
wind powers directly.

00:15:48.739 --> 00:15:52.326
So I used her to propel
myself like an arrow.

00:15:52.368 --> 00:15:56.247
It's the only thing
I could think to do.

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.248
[PENELOPE groans]

00:15:57.290 --> 00:15:59.959
Yah! Ah!

00:16:00.001 --> 00:16:01.169
I'm sorry.

00:16:01.210 --> 00:16:02.753
[DORIS]
Penelope!

00:16:02.795 --> 00:16:04.255
Cecily...

00:16:04.297 --> 00:16:06.757
How could you?!

00:16:06.799 --> 00:16:10.219
Doris. I think it's time
we end this once and for all!

00:16:10.261 --> 00:16:11.888
[DORIS]
I couldn't agree more!

00:16:11.929 --> 00:16:12.889
Hah!

00:16:12.930 --> 00:16:14.223
Doris, no!

00:16:14.265 --> 00:16:18.352
[DORIS] I will have Aria,
even if it costs me my life!

00:16:18.394 --> 00:16:20.730
[CECILY] The Emperor's not gonna
change his mind just 'cause

00:16:20.771 --> 00:16:22.648
you brought him
another Demon Sword!

00:16:22.690 --> 00:16:24.734
[DORIS panting]

00:16:24.775 --> 00:16:26.152
[CECILY]
I don't wanna fight you, Doris!

00:16:26.194 --> 00:16:27.695
Well, you don't have a choice!

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.530
It doesn't have to be this way!

00:16:29.572 --> 00:16:31.699
Shut up! I'll do
whatever I have to

00:16:31.741 --> 00:16:34.619
to make sure Princess
Charlotte is happy!

00:16:35.411 --> 00:16:36.829
We're not trying
to be difficult,

00:16:36.871 --> 00:16:39.373
but we're desperate here.
Can't you see that?

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:41.083
[CECILY]
Would you snap out of it?!

00:16:41.125 --> 00:16:43.085
The Emperor will
never welcome you back!

00:16:43.127 --> 00:16:45.338
If anything,
he plans to kill you!

00:16:45.379 --> 00:16:47.507
All this fighting
won't get you anywhere!

00:16:47.548 --> 00:16:50.134
[DORIS] I said, shut up!
That's not true!

00:16:50.176 --> 00:16:52.720
[CECILY] Forget about
going back to the Empire!

00:16:52.762 --> 00:16:54.847
Tell Charlotte to drop
the "E" from her name!

00:16:54.889 --> 00:16:58.476
Who cares if she's not royalty?!
Focus on what's important!

00:16:58.518 --> 00:17:01.354
The four of you finding
happiness somewhere together!

00:17:01.395 --> 00:17:04.065
That's what really
matters, right?!

00:17:04.106 --> 00:17:05.858
[DORIS growls]

00:17:07.818 --> 00:17:08.778
No...

00:17:08.819 --> 00:17:11.364
No, that's not enough.

00:17:11.405 --> 00:17:13.783
I will make her wish come true!

00:17:13.824 --> 00:17:15.159
No matter what!

00:17:17.245 --> 00:17:19.330
How can you be so blind?!

00:17:35.513 --> 00:17:39.809
[gasps]
Doris! Margot! Penelope!

00:17:42.687 --> 00:17:44.105
[CHARLOTTE whimpers]

00:17:44.146 --> 00:17:46.274
[CECILY]
Charlotte...

00:17:46.315 --> 00:17:48.651
Please defect to
the Garrison State.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:50.486
No, I can't...

00:17:50.528 --> 00:17:52.113
I won't give up on
my mother's wish!

00:17:52.154 --> 00:17:54.073
I've lived my entire life
wanting only to prove

00:17:54.115 --> 00:17:58.536
our legitimacy. I can't abandon
her now, when I'm so close!

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.664
[CECILY] Take a good look
at what's in front of you.

00:18:01.706 --> 00:18:03.541
These three have
risked their lives fighting

00:18:03.583 --> 00:18:05.459
for your happiness.

00:18:05.501 --> 00:18:08.921
But all you can seem to focus on
is your dead mother.

00:18:08.963 --> 00:18:10.590
I thought they
were your friends,

00:18:10.631 --> 00:18:12.842
but now I see they're
just your servants.

00:18:12.883 --> 00:18:16.846
No. That's not true!
They're very important to me!

00:18:16.887 --> 00:18:21.392
[CECILY] That's right,
because they're your family.

00:18:21.434 --> 00:18:24.604
Let go of the past and start
a new life with them.

00:18:24.645 --> 00:18:27.148
But I still feel like I'd be
betraying both the Empire

00:18:27.189 --> 00:18:28.983
and my mother's dreams.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.110
Like I'll be forced
to live a life of shame.

00:18:31.152 --> 00:18:33.529
No, you'll be living
your own life for once!

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:35.197
[gasps]

00:18:35.239 --> 00:18:37.074
Who cares what
anyone else thinks?

00:18:37.116 --> 00:18:38.701
As long as the four
of you are together,

00:18:38.743 --> 00:18:41.829
you'll be able to find
happiness wherever you go.

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:43.289
That's what it's all about,
Charlotte.

00:18:43.331 --> 00:18:46.834
Devoting your life to
the people you care for.

00:18:46.876 --> 00:18:49.837
So you really think
I should go through with it.

00:18:49.879 --> 00:18:52.214
I think it's the only choice
you have, but if you don't,

00:18:52.256 --> 00:18:54.175
you're gonna hafta fight me.

00:19:06.604 --> 00:19:09.148
All I ever wanted was to make
my mother's wish come true

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.233
so she'd be happy.

00:19:12.735 --> 00:19:16.238
I thought chasing her dream
would keep me from losing her.

00:19:18.574 --> 00:19:21.535
Do you have any idea
how much I loved her?

00:19:21.577 --> 00:19:23.245
[CECILY]
Mm-hmm.

00:19:27.458 --> 00:19:29.418
[CHARLOTTE]
Ha...!

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.212
[CECILY grunts]

00:19:31.253 --> 00:19:32.963
[CHARLOTTE]
Ah!

00:19:36.175 --> 00:19:41.972
[CHARLOTTE sobbing]

00:19:42.014 --> 00:19:46.644
From this day on, Princess
Charlotte E. Frobisher is dead.

00:19:46.686 --> 00:19:48.062
[gasps]

00:19:50.147 --> 00:19:52.149
Yeah. It's okay, let it out.

00:19:52.191 --> 00:19:58.030
[wailing]

00:20:13.003 --> 00:20:15.214
[CECILY] The Emperor's army
took the four Demon Swords

00:20:15.256 --> 00:20:17.007
and didn't even ask
your whereabouts.

00:20:17.049 --> 00:20:19.301
So you shouldn't have any
problems on your travels.

00:20:19.343 --> 00:20:20.469
[CHARLOTTE]
Please thank Mayor Housman

00:20:20.511 --> 00:20:22.096
for everything he's done.

00:20:22.138 --> 00:20:25.349
And Cecily, I do wanna
apologize again for any trouble

00:20:25.391 --> 00:20:26.892
we may have caused you.

00:20:26.934 --> 00:20:28.227
Water under the bridge.

00:20:28.269 --> 00:20:31.105
Would you please tell Luke
and Lisa I said goodbye?

00:20:31.147 --> 00:20:32.106
Sure.

00:20:32.148 --> 00:20:35.735
We have something for you.
Just a few snacks for the road.

00:20:35.776 --> 00:20:37.486
I hope you girls enjoy them.

00:20:37.528 --> 00:20:41.407
[FIO] Of course they will.
I made them, didn't I?

00:20:41.449 --> 00:20:43.492
Ah. Thank you so much.

00:20:43.534 --> 00:20:45.286
We're sad to see you go.

00:20:45.327 --> 00:20:48.330
[CHARLOTTE]
Mrs. Cambell!

00:20:48.372 --> 00:20:50.166
Take good care of yourself.

00:20:50.207 --> 00:20:52.042
And don't push
yourself too hard.

00:20:52.084 --> 00:20:53.753
[CHARLOTTE]
Yes, ma'am...

00:20:53.794 --> 00:20:57.757
[sighs] I'm gonna miss
hanging out with you, Cecily.

00:20:57.798 --> 00:20:59.008
And your hooters.

00:20:59.049 --> 00:21:01.177
It always comes back
to the boobs.

00:21:01.218 --> 00:21:03.554
I only hope my gazongas
are half the size of yours

00:21:03.596 --> 00:21:04.680
when I'm your age!

00:21:04.722 --> 00:21:05.765
--Hey!
--[ARIA chuckles]

00:21:05.806 --> 00:21:07.975
[DORIS]
Um. Cecily?

00:21:08.017 --> 00:21:10.436
I hope, someday,
our paths will cross again.

00:21:10.478 --> 00:21:12.772
I'll be countin' down the days.

00:21:12.813 --> 00:21:15.399
[DORIS chuckles]

00:21:15.441 --> 00:21:18.360
[CHARLOTTE] Cecily? There's
something I need to tell you.

00:21:18.402 --> 00:21:21.280
We came to Housman because
a man told us about Aria.

00:21:21.322 --> 00:21:23.282
The same man who gave us
the four Demon Swords

00:21:23.324 --> 00:21:24.617
and told us to attack.

00:21:24.658 --> 00:21:26.035
Who was this man?

00:21:26.076 --> 00:21:28.662
A gentleman by
the name of Siegfried.

00:21:28.704 --> 00:21:30.956
Siegfried, you say?

00:21:30.998 --> 00:21:32.208
[CHARLOTTE]
I don't know much about him,

00:21:32.249 --> 00:21:34.043
but they say he controls demons.

00:21:34.084 --> 00:21:36.420
[DORIS] C'mon, Miss Charlotte!
Let's get going!

00:21:36.462 --> 00:21:38.088
[CHARLOTTE]
Give me just a second!

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.840
Thanks again for
everything you've done.

00:21:39.882 --> 00:21:41.634
[CECILY]
Take care of yourself, okay?

00:21:41.675 --> 00:21:43.344
And stay out of trouble.

00:21:43.385 --> 00:21:44.929
[CHARLOTTE]
That shouldn't be a problem.

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:47.640
I've got my family
looking out for me.

00:21:50.267 --> 00:21:52.937
Oh, and Cecily.

00:21:52.978 --> 00:21:56.482
I've decided to drop the "E."
It was dumb anyway.

00:21:57.733 --> 00:21:59.109
[CECILY chuckles]

00:21:59.151 --> 00:22:01.403
I think your mother
would be very proud of you.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:03.364
Besides, you'll always be
a princess to the girls

00:22:03.405 --> 00:22:04.990
who helped raise you.

00:22:05.032 --> 00:22:06.492
[CHARLOTTE]
Mm.
