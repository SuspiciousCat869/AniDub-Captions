WEBVTT

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:07.649
[Nagi] Whacha looking
at, Big Brother?

00:00:07.749 --> 00:00:09.218
[Yamato] Hm?
[Nagi] Land?!

00:00:09.318 --> 00:00:11.524
[Nagi] Oh, I bet
you're going with Mei!

00:00:11.624 --> 00:00:12.792
I wanna go with you!

00:00:12.893 --> 00:00:14.796
No. This is going to be a

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:16.499
special day for me and Mei.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.540
What? You greedy butt.

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:56.232
[Asami] You hadn't
told anyone yet?

00:01:57.802 --> 00:02:00.474
When Takeshi and I started
seeing each other,

00:02:00.575 --> 00:02:03.313
we went around telling
everybody that we knew.

00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:05.117
It's kind of embarrassing.

00:02:05.217 --> 00:02:07.689
And I'm sure no one's
interested in me, anyway.

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.164
Uh-uh huh, there are all kinds
of people who wanna know
about you and Yamato-kun.

00:02:12.666 --> 00:02:13.901
Oh, hi Kai-kun.

00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:15.337
Ladies.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.776
S'up?

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:20.815
Sounds like you're having fun.

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:21.917
What are you talking about?

00:02:22.017 --> 00:02:23.253
Kai-kun, would you tell people

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:25.490
about it or keep it quiet?

00:02:25.591 --> 00:02:26.593
Tell 'em what?

00:02:26.694 --> 00:02:28.698
About love.

00:02:28.798 --> 00:02:32.605
Mei-chan says she hasn't said
anything even though she's
going out with Yamato.

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:34.676
[Mei] Asami-san!
[Kai] Okay, then.

00:02:34.776 --> 00:02:37.549
Do you go to Land with your
friends or on a date?

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:39.218
What does this have
to do with Land?

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:42.057
Everyone goes to Land!
So, which is it?

00:02:42.157 --> 00:02:44.228
I think I prefer going
with my friends.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:45.665
What about you, Mei-chan?

00:02:45.765 --> 00:02:48.269
Uh... Either's fine...

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.207
You have to choose one.

00:02:50.307 --> 00:02:54.048
I can totally see you going
on a date there with Yamato.

00:02:54.148 --> 00:02:56.419
Um... I guess so.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.524
Going with your friends
is a lot of fun,

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:01.429
but it's fun in a different
way when you're on a date.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.201
Land works on all
kinds of levels!

00:03:09.078 --> 00:03:10.113
[Megumi] Kai-kun!

00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:11.617
[Kai] Huh?

00:03:11.717 --> 00:03:12.819
Kitagawa...

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:14.188
[Girl 1] Megumi-senpai!

00:03:14.288 --> 00:03:15.925
We always read your magazines.

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:18.463
The other day we read in an
interview that you said in a

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:21.737
magazine that you
love Land, so...

00:03:21.837 --> 00:03:23.974
Please accept this package!

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.179
It's so cute. Are you sure?

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:27.849
[Girl 1] Yes, of course!

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.285
[Megumi] Thank you.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.493
You're lucky, Kitagawa...

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:35.464
All you have to do
is say you like Land,

00:03:35.565 --> 00:03:39.673
and your fangirls come
flying out of the lockers
with gift baskets.

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:42.311
You can have it, if you like.

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.583
Huh? Are you sure?

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.720
Yeah.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.421
Seriously?

00:03:47.522 --> 00:03:49.158
Yeah, sure you can.

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.897
Yeah! All right!

00:03:51.997 --> 00:03:52.932
Wait a minute!

00:03:53.032 --> 00:03:54.101
What the-?!

00:03:54.201 --> 00:03:55.738
[Kai] Wasn't this
a present for you?

00:03:55.838 --> 00:03:58.143
You should be thinking
about how those girls feel.

00:03:58.243 --> 00:03:59.846
[Megumi] Oh, come on,
Takemura-kun.

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:01.617
[Megumi] It's not
like I wanted it.
[Kai] What?

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:03.253
I'd rather give it to
someone who's going to

00:04:03.353 --> 00:04:04.890
use the doggone thing anyway.

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:07.194
Besides, it's not like I'm
going to spend an afternoon

00:04:07.294 --> 00:04:09.198
running around Land anyway.

00:04:09.298 --> 00:04:11.937
[Kai] Why would you
lie about liking it?

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.481
Okay. You can have
these instead.

00:04:17.582 --> 00:04:20.320
Day passes. My agent
got them for me.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.992
Seriously? But these
are really expensive!

00:04:23.092 --> 00:04:26.967
[Megumi] It's fine.
[Kai] I can't take these
from you! I'll pay you.

00:04:27.067 --> 00:04:29.806
What part of "they're free"
aren't you getting?

00:04:29.906 --> 00:04:31.142
Wha-?! Come on!

00:04:31.242 --> 00:04:32.779
Aah.... Ah!

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.651
Look, Takemura, I heard you
and Yamato are friends.

00:04:35.751 --> 00:04:39.325
I thought maybe if I
did something nice for
you, Yamato might...

00:04:39.425 --> 00:04:41.195
Ah, jeez. Just drop it.

00:04:41.295 --> 00:04:44.068
"Something nice"? What
do you mean by that?

00:04:44.168 --> 00:04:46.874
[Megumi] Never mind.
I'll do it myself.

00:04:46.974 --> 00:04:48.711
[Kai] Huh? Hey, the tickets!

00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:52.351
[Megumi] They're yours. Or
throw them away, I don't care.

00:05:07.715 --> 00:05:10.053
Asami-chan, let me help you.

00:05:10.153 --> 00:05:11.389
Megu-tan.

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:14.261
I'm not just lanky. I'm
pretty strong as well.

00:05:14.361 --> 00:05:16.032
Ah! Well, thanks a lot!

00:05:16.132 --> 00:05:18.804
I know you and I haven't
talked a lot before today,

00:05:18.904 --> 00:05:21.777
but you know, you were the
first friend I made when
I came to school, right?

00:05:21.877 --> 00:05:25.785
[Asami] What?
[Megumi] We should really get
to know each other better.

00:05:27.221 --> 00:05:28.858
[Megumi &amp; Asami] Excuse us.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.732
[Megumi gasp] I had no idea.

00:05:32.832 --> 00:05:36.840
[Asami] I know, right? I didn't
know until I saw it on the web.

00:05:39.011 --> 00:05:42.117
Well, it's time for this
girl to go powder her nose.

00:05:42.217 --> 00:05:43.687
Right behind you!

00:05:48.296 --> 00:05:49.498
[Megumi] Yamato-kun.

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:51.402
[Yamato] Kitagawa.

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:52.872
Uh, do you have a minute?

00:05:52.972 --> 00:05:54.108
Hm?

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.281
Mei and Kai?

00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:59.920
Yesterday, I overheard
them on the roof.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.994
The two of them were talking
excitedly about going
to Land together.

00:06:05.263 --> 00:06:07.735
Mei-chan is dating
you, isn't she?

00:06:07.835 --> 00:06:12.579
It's kind of strange, but I
don't think Mei going out on
a date with Kai-kun is right.

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:14.983
It can't be. You've
got it wrong.

00:06:15.083 --> 00:06:16.787
I'm not so sure.

00:06:18.122 --> 00:06:19.458
I mean, I'm sorry.

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:21.495
But I wasn't sure if I
should tell you or not.

00:06:21.597 --> 00:06:23.968
I just didn't want
to keep it from you.

00:06:42.037 --> 00:06:44.141
I... I think I...

00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:46.613
I... I think I like her.

00:06:48.283 --> 00:06:51.623
[Megumi humming]

00:06:53.894 --> 00:06:55.096
Hey, Megu.

00:06:57.434 --> 00:06:59.405
Never mind. It's nothing.

00:06:59.506 --> 00:07:00.407
What is it?

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:01.810
Don't make that scary face.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.580
You haven't been
talking a lot lately,

00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.620
and at other times, you're
really cheerful, like just now.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.557
You seem to be
having mood swings.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.828
[Megumi] Mood swings?
[Momoko] Yeah.

00:07:10.928 --> 00:07:13.600
[Momoko] I thought maybe you're
worried about work or something.

00:07:13.701 --> 00:07:18.409
Of course not. Momo, you
shouldn't stick your nose
in where it doesn't belong.

00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:21.048
[Megumi] It's creepy.
[Momoko] Huh?

00:07:28.196 --> 00:07:30.033
[Megumi] Good morning.

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:31.335
Good timing, Megumi.

00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:33.807
Let me introduce our
newest face, Izumi-san.

00:07:33.907 --> 00:07:37.414
I'm hoping the two of you
will become the corner
stones of our agency.

00:07:37.515 --> 00:07:40.955
Oh wow! I'd be honored to!

00:07:41.055 --> 00:07:43.493
Nice to meet you.
My name is Izumi.

00:07:43.594 --> 00:07:46.800
I'm looking forward
to working with you.

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.604
It's nice to meet you, too.

00:07:48.704 --> 00:07:50.608
[Izumi] Megumi-san,
you're so cute.

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:52.311
I've always looked up to you!

00:07:52.411 --> 00:07:55.483
[Megumi chuckles] What?
Izumi-chan, you're
cuter than me.

00:07:55.584 --> 00:07:57.789
I'm absolutely jealous
of your legs.

00:08:01.395 --> 00:08:04.602
[Girl] Megumi-chan, you're
always in the back because
you're so tall.

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:09.646
[Boy] You're wrong! She's always
in the back because she's the
ugliest in the class!

00:08:34.896 --> 00:08:36.165
Sorry.

00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:42.979
[Yamato] Mei...
[Mei] Hm?

00:08:43.079 --> 00:08:45.885
[Yamato] Have you... have you
ever had another boyfriend?

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.824
I mean steadily.

00:08:48.924 --> 00:08:50.661
Have you ever dated anyone else?

00:08:50.761 --> 00:08:54.101
[Mei] Uuuh? What? Of course not.

00:08:54.201 --> 00:08:58.076
Tell me honestly. Do you
talk about this kind of
thing with any other people?

00:08:59.546 --> 00:09:02.017
[Mei] What are you-
[Yamato] You talk about
it with Kai, don't you?

00:09:02.117 --> 00:09:03.821
Huh?

00:09:03.921 --> 00:09:06.760
[Yamato] It's fine. Forget it.

00:09:09.198 --> 00:09:11.102
<i>[Mei] He's mad.</i>

00:09:11.202 --> 00:09:12.905
<i>Did I... do something?</i>

00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:23.059
[Mei] Aiko-san-
[Asami] Aiko-chan!

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.294
Hey.

00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:27.300
We were thinking about going
out for tea! Wanna join?

00:09:27.401 --> 00:09:28.871
Okay, sure.

00:09:28.971 --> 00:09:33.647
Also, Megu-tan here was wanting
to ask you a little question.

00:09:33.747 --> 00:09:36.953
Aiko, Asami-chan told me
about all the weight you lost.

00:09:37.053 --> 00:09:41.061
That had to be an amazing
diet if it helped you to
get rid of 45 pounds.

00:09:41.162 --> 00:09:44.401
[Aiko] Yeah.
[Megumi] Even if it was
for someone you love,

00:09:44.502 --> 00:09:47.207
[Megumi] it couldn't
have been easy, right?

00:09:47.307 --> 00:09:48.677
Your skin is beautiful, too.

00:09:48.777 --> 00:09:50.681
I can tell you
worked really hard.

00:09:50.781 --> 00:09:54.756
It's my job to have people
looking at me all the time,
so when I heard about you,

00:09:54.856 --> 00:09:57.360
I just said to myself
"That's your example."

00:09:57.461 --> 00:10:00.935
Uh... thanks? I think.

00:10:01.035 --> 00:10:02.471
Huh? Mei-chan!

00:10:02.572 --> 00:10:04.542
Tachibana, come with us.

00:10:04.642 --> 00:10:06.580
Ah, c'mon! It'll be fun!

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:12.692
I'm sorry, guys.

00:10:14.027 --> 00:10:17.602
But I... I have
something to do...

00:10:17.702 --> 00:10:18.570
Tachibana?

00:10:18.670 --> 00:10:20.473
Really? Gosh darn it.

00:10:20.574 --> 00:10:23.012
Let's try again some
other time, then.

00:10:23.112 --> 00:10:24.248
[Mei] Uh, sure.

00:10:31.362 --> 00:10:36.640
<i>[Mei] Yanno... I use to be fine</i>
<i>with the idea of being alone.</i>

00:10:37.542 --> 00:10:38.911
<i>But now...</i>

00:10:41.348 --> 00:10:44.321
<i>I've learned what it's</i>
<i>like to be around people.</i>

00:10:46.793 --> 00:10:51.035
<i>I knew it wasn't going</i>
<i>to be easy. Not one bit.</i>

00:10:51.135 --> 00:10:53.740
<i>I thought I was ready for it.</i>

00:10:54.609 --> 00:10:56.345
<i>I'm scared.</i>

00:10:56.445 --> 00:10:59.519
<i>When I think about all the</i>
<i>friends I just made leaving</i>

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.790
<i>or turning their backs on me...</i>

00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:03.660
<i>It scares me...</i>

00:11:05.463 --> 00:11:08.436
[Megumi] Tea's on me, girls.
[Aiko] What?
[Asami] Seriously?!

00:11:08.537 --> 00:11:11.475
[Megumi] Someone at my
agency is friends with
the owner of this place.

00:11:11.576 --> 00:11:13.446
He's pretty influential.

00:11:13.547 --> 00:11:16.586
[Asami] Megu-tan, you know all
kinds of people, don't you?

00:11:16.686 --> 00:11:18.590
You're like a celebrity.

00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:20.995
Not really, Asami-chan.

00:11:33.452 --> 00:11:34.254
[Kai] Mei?

00:11:34.354 --> 00:11:35.724
[Mei] Kai-kun.

00:11:35.824 --> 00:11:36.826
[Kai] What's wrong?

00:11:36.927 --> 00:11:38.195
You don't look
like you're happy.

00:11:38.296 --> 00:11:40.099
Are you okay?

00:11:43.105 --> 00:11:46.278
Huh? What is it?
Wh-what happened?

00:11:46.378 --> 00:11:48.416
Uh, I just...

00:11:48.517 --> 00:11:49.986
[Kai] What?!

00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:53.192
[Kai] Me?! I-I'm the reason?!
[Mei] No, Kai-kun!

00:11:53.292 --> 00:11:56.131
Sorry, I shouldn't have
bothered you with it, okay?

00:11:56.232 --> 00:11:57.500
I'll figure it out.

00:11:57.602 --> 00:11:58.604
[Kai] What happened?

00:11:58.704 --> 00:12:00.874
Uh, nothing really.

00:12:00.975 --> 00:12:04.314
Those aren't nothings
rolling down your face.

00:12:04.414 --> 00:12:06.886
You don't need to handle this
by yourself, okay, Mei?

00:12:06.987 --> 00:12:09.926
You're not helping anything
by keeping it quiet.

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:16.205
No one gonna ask you
what's wrong unless they
really wanna help you.

00:12:23.452 --> 00:12:26.191
[Mei] I was just wondering
if it'd be better if I didn't

00:12:26.292 --> 00:12:28.997
get involved with
people anymore.

00:12:29.097 --> 00:12:32.304
It's like a great big hassle.

00:12:32.404 --> 00:12:34.207
[Kai] You know, Mei...

00:12:34.308 --> 00:12:37.447
Seems to me you tell people
they should have confidence,

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.585
but you don't have
any of your own.

00:12:39.686 --> 00:12:41.288
You do things for other people,

00:12:41.388 --> 00:12:44.061
but you don't accept
help from anyone else.

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:47.367
[Kai] Are you really
that down on yourself?
[Mei] Uh huh...

00:12:47.467 --> 00:12:51.342
Maybe that's also why you're
so direct with people too.

00:12:51.442 --> 00:12:52.511
What?

00:12:52.612 --> 00:12:55.083
Seriously. Senpai,
it's pretty cool.

00:12:55.183 --> 00:12:57.120
You're actually kind of tough.

00:12:59.458 --> 00:13:01.295
[Mei] Thank you, Kai-kun.

00:13:01.395 --> 00:13:04.034
Mei, if there's someone in your
life you don't want to lose,

00:13:04.134 --> 00:13:07.541
you're gonna have to use
some of that forthright
attitude on them.

00:13:09.044 --> 00:13:11.950
Just look at the big picture.
All of those things that look

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:14.956
like big problems get really
small in a big hurry.

00:13:15.056 --> 00:13:17.928
Stand up, and don't
be afraid anymore.

00:13:18.029 --> 00:13:20.466
Get off your butt and
go talk to him, already.

00:13:25.577 --> 00:13:27.013
Sure.

00:13:29.418 --> 00:13:30.854
<i>[Mei] He's right.</i>

00:13:30.954 --> 00:13:34.027
<i>I can't just wait forever.</i>

00:13:34.127 --> 00:13:36.131
<i>I have to make my move.</i>

00:13:38.537 --> 00:13:39.839
[Mei] Yamato.

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:40.741
[Yamato] Mei.

00:13:40.841 --> 00:13:42.477
I was...

00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:45.249
just thinking I'd like
to go home together today.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:48.022
What? Oh, sorry.

00:13:48.122 --> 00:13:50.259
I have to stay after
school for a meeting.

00:13:50.360 --> 00:13:51.763
[Mei] I'll wait.

00:13:51.863 --> 00:13:53.099
I want to go home with you,

00:13:53.199 --> 00:13:55.470
so I'll wait until you're done.

00:13:55.571 --> 00:13:57.040
Is that alright?

00:14:00.079 --> 00:14:02.050
Sure thing. I'll be here.

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.902
<i>[Mei] I have... people</i>
<i>who believe in me.</i>

00:14:31.576 --> 00:14:33.814
[Mei] Thank you very much.

00:14:33.914 --> 00:14:36.018
[Lady] Mei-chan. Mei-chan!
[Mei] Uh, yeah?

00:14:36.118 --> 00:14:38.924
Well now, isn't he
here to meet you?

00:14:43.533 --> 00:14:45.036
Kai-kun?

00:14:47.373 --> 00:14:50.146
[Kai] Are you going somewhere
with Yamato after this?

00:14:50.246 --> 00:14:53.587
[Mei] No, we haven't
made any plans.

00:14:53.687 --> 00:14:57.561
[Kai] Hmm. Your relationship's
kind of bland, isn't it?

00:14:57.661 --> 00:14:59.799
What? you think so?

00:14:59.899 --> 00:15:03.305
Okay, I could be
wrong, but I'm not.

00:15:03.406 --> 00:15:07.213
If it were me, I'd spend as
much time with her as I could.

00:15:07.313 --> 00:15:09.384
Do you have someone like that?

00:15:12.525 --> 00:15:15.129
Sure I do. Saw her today.

00:15:15.229 --> 00:15:18.402
Huh? Well that's cool.

00:15:18.503 --> 00:15:19.806
We're not dating.

00:15:19.906 --> 00:15:22.477
I guess you could
say she's my crush.

00:15:26.853 --> 00:15:29.224
Thank you, for the
talk the other day.

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:33.265
[Kai] Huh?
[Mei] I'm happy you
were able to talk to me.

00:15:33.365 --> 00:15:36.171
I guess I needed a
little reassurance...

00:15:36.271 --> 00:15:39.745
[Mei] that it was okay to
be a little more assertive.
[Kai] Mei...

00:15:39.846 --> 00:15:43.553
I feel like your words just
scattered away the uneasiness...

00:15:43.653 --> 00:15:48.630
and the loneliness I'd been
holding inside myself lately.

00:15:48.730 --> 00:15:50.066
I see.

00:15:54.207 --> 00:15:58.015
The truth is, I've been
feeling the same way.

00:15:59.351 --> 00:16:01.623
Thanks to that girl
I told you about,

00:16:01.723 --> 00:16:05.429
I realized that all the angry
feelings I had were wrong.

00:16:05.531 --> 00:16:08.570
She... changed me.

00:16:08.670 --> 00:16:12.611
[Mei] Wow... That girl...
must really be wonderful.

00:16:12.711 --> 00:16:14.549
[Kai] Yeah.

00:16:14.649 --> 00:16:17.053
She's wonderful alright.

00:16:17.153 --> 00:16:21.161
She's experienced the same
things I've experienced.

00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:24.535
She's sweet, but she
also has a boyfriend.

00:16:26.806 --> 00:16:30.246
And wouldn't you know it?
He's a really great guy too.

00:16:30.346 --> 00:16:32.283
And he's a friend of mine.

00:16:33.285 --> 00:16:35.223
You know that girl.

00:16:45.911 --> 00:16:48.583
Because it's you, Mei Tachibana.

00:16:57.968 --> 00:17:00.908
[Girl 1] You're kidding!
Takemura-kun is that
hot guy, right!?

00:17:01.008 --> 00:17:03.713
[Girl 2] I heard they were
holding each other on
the side of the road.

00:17:03.813 --> 00:17:06.519
[Girl 3] With Mei Tachibana?
Is she honestly that cute?

00:17:06.619 --> 00:17:10.694
[Girl 4] Not really, but
all he had to do was wave
some tickets to Land at her.

00:17:10.794 --> 00:17:12.130
[All the girls] What?!

00:17:14.969 --> 00:17:18.342
Sorry. I should have
been more considerate.

00:17:20.714 --> 00:17:22.751
Oh, it's okay.

00:17:31.435 --> 00:17:33.540
[Megumi] Nevermind.
I'll do it myself.

00:17:36.546 --> 00:17:37.681
Mei.

00:17:41.756 --> 00:17:43.727
[Mei] Yama-
[Yamato] Don't.

00:17:43.827 --> 00:17:47.066
[Yamato] I don't understand
what you're doing.

00:17:47.166 --> 00:17:49.204
Hey, what are you getting
so mad about, Yamat-

00:17:49.304 --> 00:17:51.676
[Yamato] Shut up, Kai.

00:17:51.776 --> 00:17:53.212
He invited you to go with him?

00:17:53.312 --> 00:17:55.283
I heard you're going
to Land together.

00:17:55.383 --> 00:17:57.353
[Mei] What?
[Kai] Hold up.

00:17:57.453 --> 00:17:59.491
Mei's been feeling
really lousy lately.

00:17:59.592 --> 00:18:02.831
I invited her to go with
me because she needed
some cheering up.

00:18:02.932 --> 00:18:05.537
[Yamato] I said shut up.
[Kai] Hey, here's a thought.

00:18:05.637 --> 00:18:08.108
[Kai] Why don't you shut up
and listen for a change?

00:18:08.208 --> 00:18:10.881
She's beside herself
over you, you jackass.

00:18:10.981 --> 00:18:13.419
And you're just thinking
of yourself!

00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.857
Take your jealous boyfriend
act and shove it.

00:18:15.958 --> 00:18:18.697
You're sitting on the sidelines
of your own relationship,

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:22.337
waiting for someone else
to tell you how to think
and feel about it.

00:18:22.437 --> 00:18:24.240
The same crap you
pulled in middle school!

00:18:26.078 --> 00:18:29.084
I... Jeez, man.

00:18:29.184 --> 00:18:30.988
Is that what you
really think of me?

00:18:31.088 --> 00:18:35.998
We were friends. But face
it, you weren't exactly
in a rush to get my back.

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:40.072
Maybe all of those social
graces of yours were
just a smokescreen.

00:18:40.172 --> 00:18:44.247
Well, buddy. I use to be
jealous of the way you were
all slick with everyone.

00:18:44.347 --> 00:18:47.387
But it pisses me off,
and Mei deserves better.

00:18:47.487 --> 00:18:48.623
Kai!

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.269
I'm not the guy I
used to be, Yamato.

00:18:55.369 --> 00:18:59.645
You cross me and I'll do
a lot more than knock you
on your ass next time.

00:19:01.481 --> 00:19:05.757
[Yamato] I couldn't help you
then. I was totally pathetic.

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:08.930
I'm glad that you came
back stronger than before.

00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:13.540
It's better really. But...
you don't seem happy about it.

00:19:13.640 --> 00:19:16.478
I kind of thought it was a good
thing to see you again, Yamato,

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:19.117
but you really haven't
changed at all.

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:23.593
But when I met Mei, I found
someone who had the same
experiences I did.

00:19:23.693 --> 00:19:26.933
Because of that, she's
a lot better than you.

00:19:27.033 --> 00:19:32.043
She doesn't sidestep her
problems, but you just
keep ignoring them.

00:19:32.143 --> 00:19:35.416
I've beaten my demons,
just like her.

00:19:38.155 --> 00:19:41.562
[Yamato] So all this is about
being a better guy than I am?
[Kai] What?

00:19:41.662 --> 00:19:44.401
I may not be able to understand
everything that hurts Mei,

00:19:44.502 --> 00:19:47.775
but at least I'll put
in the work to find out.

00:19:47.875 --> 00:19:53.318
Something else... I wanna show
her all the fun things in this
world she hasn't seen yet.

00:19:53.419 --> 00:19:57.460
And I want us to grow
and understand each other.

00:19:57.561 --> 00:20:00.299
So if you're approaching Mei
because you wanna beat me

00:20:00.399 --> 00:20:02.971
and show me how big
you've gotten...

00:20:03.072 --> 00:20:07.514
Or if you're just hanging
around her to settle
things between us...

00:20:07.614 --> 00:20:09.284
Then this fight isn't over.

00:20:09.384 --> 00:20:11.354
I won't let you have her!

00:20:28.355 --> 00:20:33.031
Oh, come on! Just say what
you're thinking to her
and get it out in the open.

00:20:33.132 --> 00:20:34.869
If you like her, don't make
her wait to hear it from you.

00:20:37.073 --> 00:20:38.510
[Yamato] Kai?

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:42.183
I... really do like Mei a lot.

00:20:42.283 --> 00:20:45.590
It's okay though, if I
just have her as a friend.

00:20:46.057 --> 00:20:47.694
And you...

00:20:51.468 --> 00:20:54.207
I did feel inferior to you,
but you know something...

00:20:54.307 --> 00:20:56.244
If you weren't there
for me back then,

00:20:56.344 --> 00:20:58.583
I wouldn't even be here today.

00:20:59.819 --> 00:21:01.288
Sorry I hit you.

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:03.526
Kai...

00:21:17.386 --> 00:21:19.157
Mei, I'm sorry.

00:21:19.257 --> 00:21:21.696
He was right about me, too.

00:21:21.796 --> 00:21:27.173
I really didn't notice it
when you started acting
like you were lonely.

00:21:27.273 --> 00:21:31.616
I was causing you to feel
hurt and ignored it without
realizing it myself.

00:21:31.716 --> 00:21:32.951
I'm sorry.

00:21:33.051 --> 00:21:34.387
Mei...

00:21:36.491 --> 00:21:38.930
What do you say we
go to Land together?

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:41.368
Yeah. I want to go with you.

00:21:43.005 --> 00:21:44.842
I'm looking forward to it.

00:21:50.887 --> 00:21:52.023
So am I.

00:23:30.687 --> 00:23:35.597
[Mei] People become stronger and
kinder because of their pain.

00:23:35.697 --> 00:23:39.571
I feel like I've been taught
what it truly means to be human.

00:23:39.672 --> 00:23:42.243
[Marshmellow] I-I just
became human, too. Meow!

00:23:42.343 --> 00:23:43.913
[Mei] "Meow", huh?
