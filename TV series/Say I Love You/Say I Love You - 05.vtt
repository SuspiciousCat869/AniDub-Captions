WEBVTT

00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:16.667
[Yamato] What's wrong, Mei?

00:00:17.502 --> 00:00:18.638
[Mei] A cat...

00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:20.073
Hmm?

00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:24.382
Wow, he's cute.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.787
Someone just left him here...

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:30.862
I wish I could take him home,

00:00:30.962 --> 00:00:33.099
but we already have a cat.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:38.343
But if I just leave him
here, he'll be taken to a
shelter for strays and...

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.149
I bet he'll be fine.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:43.253
He's such a little
cutie and all,

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:45.224
I bet someone will snap
him up in a heartbeat.

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.428
[Mei] How can you be so cold?

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:51.570
This is a matter of whether
this little cat lives or dies.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.647
He's desperately crying
for our help. Don't act...

00:00:56.747 --> 00:00:58.718
like it doesn't concern you.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.126
You're right.

00:01:03.226 --> 00:01:06.934
[Mei] Sorry. You didn't do
anything, Kurosawa-kun.

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:08.336
I just wanna...

00:01:09.038 --> 00:01:11.042
[Mei's phone vibrates]

00:01:12.846 --> 00:01:14.115
[Yamato] Mei, help me!

00:01:14.215 --> 00:01:15.718
Wh-What's going on?!

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:16.954
[Yamato] Please, I can't...

00:01:17.054 --> 00:01:19.425
Oh man! I-I don't
know what to do!

00:01:19.526 --> 00:01:22.966
It's okay, alright?! Calm down
and tell me what's going on!

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:25.571
[Yamato] He won't drink
anything but milk!

00:01:25.672 --> 00:01:27.441
The cat? The cat, right?

00:01:27.542 --> 00:01:30.047
That's right. He wasn't
eating anything else.

00:01:30.147 --> 00:01:32.585
But then, he started
sniffing at my sashimi,

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:34.155
[Yamato] and I gave him some.
[Kitten beings meowing]

00:01:34.255 --> 00:01:35.658
[Mei] And then?
[Yamato] And he started

00:01:35.758 --> 00:01:36.927
to chew on it a little...

00:01:37.027 --> 00:01:38.096
Then he started crying

00:01:38.196 --> 00:01:40.668
for more after he barfed.

00:01:40.768 --> 00:01:42.806
Listen! Can't you hear him?!

00:01:42.906 --> 00:01:44.743
What's going on, Tachibana-san?

00:01:44.843 --> 00:01:46.245
What kind of sashimi was it?

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:48.450
[Yamato] A chunk of tuna,
about an inch wide.

00:01:48.551 --> 00:01:52.091
That's too big. Tear it into
smaller pieces for him.

00:01:54.195 --> 00:01:55.364
[Yamato gasp in surprise]

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:56.634
[Yamato] He's chewing it!

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:59.673
All right! He ate it
without throwing up!

00:01:59.773 --> 00:02:02.011
Man, he's too cute!

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:04.516
By the way, he
hasn't pooped yet.

00:02:04.616 --> 00:02:07.656
What? That's way more
important, you idiot!

00:02:07.756 --> 00:02:08.924
[Yamato] Idiot?!

00:02:09.025 --> 00:02:10.762
Uh, he's straining...

00:02:12.632 --> 00:02:14.302
He's straining!

00:02:16.807 --> 00:02:19.245
He just pooped! Hallelujah!

00:02:19.345 --> 00:02:21.416
Wow, I don't know what
I'd do without you.

00:02:21.517 --> 00:02:23.654
You're awesome, Mei! Thanks.

00:04:01.382 --> 00:04:03.521
[Yamato] Ta-da! Look!

00:04:03.621 --> 00:04:04.723
Wow!

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:05.925
He's adorable!

00:04:06.025 --> 00:04:07.227
[Yamato] I know, right?

00:04:07.327 --> 00:04:09.733
I named him Kuro after
his sleek, black fur.

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.572
That's my boy. Kuro!

00:04:12.672 --> 00:04:15.210
Kuro, huh? Even
his name is cute.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.312
Not very original.

00:04:16.412 --> 00:04:17.982
His eyes are really big!

00:04:18.082 --> 00:04:20.353
When it's feeding time,
he just stares at me with

00:04:20.454 --> 00:04:23.794
those big eyes of his.
It's too cute for words.

00:04:23.894 --> 00:04:25.998
Lucky you, Yamato.

00:04:26.098 --> 00:04:27.034
[Yamato] Want a picture?

00:04:27.134 --> 00:04:28.571
Mmhmm!

00:04:29.606 --> 00:04:32.679
I'll take it and set
it as my background.

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:34.549
[Nakanishi] What are
you doing, Asamicchi?

00:04:34.649 --> 00:04:36.720
Everyone knows a couple's
backgrounds should be a

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.356
shot of them together!

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:40.160
But he's such a
cute little kitty.

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.797
But we're cute together
too, yanno!

00:04:41.897 --> 00:04:45.938
[Aiko] God, shut up. You're
giving me diabetes over here.

00:04:56.492 --> 00:04:59.833
[Mei] Uh... Thanks.
[Yamato] Huh?

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:00.868
For what?

00:05:00.968 --> 00:05:02.171
The kitten.

00:05:02.271 --> 00:05:05.143
I'm glad you decided
to take care of him.

00:05:05.243 --> 00:05:09.853
But I'm wondering if I was
selfish about it and made you
take care of him, yanno.

00:05:09.953 --> 00:05:11.489
Don't worry about it, Mei.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.328
It's because of you that we get
to keep him in the first place.

00:05:14.428 --> 00:05:15.765
[Mei] Keep him?
[Yamato] Sure!

00:05:15.865 --> 00:05:17.467
[Yamato] We're not just
taking care of him,

00:05:17.569 --> 00:05:18.838
he's part of the family now.

00:05:18.938 --> 00:05:21.209
Even if the original owner
comes looking for him,

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.146
I'm not letting him go.

00:05:23.246 --> 00:05:24.348
Okay then.

00:05:24.448 --> 00:05:25.383
[Yamato] Just look at him!

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:26.920
He's just way too cute!

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.223
Don't you think?

00:05:28.323 --> 00:05:29.693
[Mei] Yeah.

00:05:30.695 --> 00:05:34.101
<i>[Mei] I'm glad</i>
<i>Kurosawa likes cats.</i>

00:05:35.705 --> 00:05:37.575
[Yamato] Yanno, Mei.
[Mei] Hm?

00:05:37.675 --> 00:05:39.144
[Yamato] You should
come over sometime.

00:05:39.245 --> 00:05:40.615
[Mei] To your place?

00:05:40.715 --> 00:05:42.919
[Yamato] We can introduce
Kuro to Marshmallow.

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.921
Whaddya say?

00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:45.591
[Mei] Mm, okay.

00:05:49.966 --> 00:05:52.104
"Come over..."

00:05:55.811 --> 00:05:57.982
He invited me over
to his house...

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:01.557
I know you're coming with
me, but it's Kurosawa's...

00:06:06.567 --> 00:06:09.405
N-No! You've got it all wrong!

00:06:09.506 --> 00:06:11.409
Marshmallow!

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:15.651
Kurosawa said he
wants to see you.

00:06:15.751 --> 00:06:17.855
I have no choice. I'll
have to go with you.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.064
[Ms. Tachibana] What's
with all the noise, Mei?

00:06:22.164 --> 00:06:26.105
[Mei] He-He didn't invite me!
He invited Marshmallow, Mom!

00:06:26.205 --> 00:06:27.709
[Ms. Tachibana] Huh?

00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:37.160
[Yamato] Mei!

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:44.843
[Mei] It's huge...

00:06:44.943 --> 00:06:45.978
[Yamato] Huh?

00:06:46.078 --> 00:06:47.414
Come on. Let's go.

00:06:47.515 --> 00:06:48.951
[Mei] Okay.

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:52.024
Big brother!

00:06:52.124 --> 00:06:54.763
You left the house without
feeding the kitten again!

00:06:54.863 --> 00:06:57.568
He's been crying for
food all afternoon!

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:00.541
[Yamato] Did I? Sorry, Kuro!

00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:03.279
Big Brother, who's she?

00:07:03.379 --> 00:07:04.950
[Yamato] Mei Tachibana.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.089
My little sister.

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:09.458
Say hi, Nagi.

00:07:12.464 --> 00:07:14.869
Uh... good afternoon.

00:07:16.506 --> 00:07:18.844
This is your girlfriend,
Big Brother?

00:07:18.944 --> 00:07:20.480
What a letdown.

00:07:20.581 --> 00:07:23.988
[Yamato] Hey, Nagi!
Behave, or else!

00:07:24.088 --> 00:07:25.423
[Nagi] Hmph!

00:07:27.829 --> 00:07:29.431
Wow.

00:07:29.532 --> 00:07:30.367
Sorry, Mei.

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:32.204
No, it's okay.

00:07:33.306 --> 00:07:34.308
I don't mind.

00:07:34.408 --> 00:07:35.978
[Yamato] Come on in.

00:07:36.078 --> 00:07:37.080
[Mei] Okay.

00:07:40.788 --> 00:07:42.090
Come in.

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.161
Thanks for having me...

00:07:48.504 --> 00:07:52.612
<i>[Mei] My first time...</i>
<i>in a boy's room.</i>

00:08:07.608 --> 00:08:10.480
Please be yummy.

00:08:17.862 --> 00:08:20.668
<i>Oh, no! We're behind</i>
<i>closed doors!</i>

00:08:22.872 --> 00:08:25.611
Mei, get your mind out
of the gutter, okay?

00:08:25.711 --> 00:08:28.282
What? That's-that's not what I-!

00:08:28.383 --> 00:08:29.619
It's alright.

00:08:29.719 --> 00:08:32.257
I won't do anything
you don't want me to.

00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:35.263
Relax, okay?

00:08:40.608 --> 00:08:41.943
Come here.

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.530
Mei, you're so aggressive!

00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.168
I-I am not! Get away from me!

00:08:54.268 --> 00:08:55.971
[Yamato] I was just kidding.

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.380
How about we spend
the day like this?

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:02.117
Wha-are you kidding?!

00:09:02.217 --> 00:09:03.854
Well?

00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:08.964
[Mei's heart slowly
begins to race]

00:09:24.161 --> 00:09:25.631
Your smell is amazing.

00:09:25.731 --> 00:09:27.702
Uh! I stink?

00:09:28.236 --> 00:09:29.572
I didn't say that.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:35.417
<i>[Mei] Kurosawa's</i>
<i>hand is so hot.</i>

00:09:35.518 --> 00:09:38.456
<i>Could he be nervous, too?</i>

00:09:38.557 --> 00:09:41.830
[Yamato] Hey, Mei?
[Mei] Yes?

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.871
Yanno, I noticed
you're still calling me
Kurosawa-kun all the time.

00:09:45.971 --> 00:09:50.280
It's okay if you use my first
name. We are dating, after all.

00:09:52.718 --> 00:09:55.891
Okay, sure...

00:09:56.793 --> 00:09:58.029
How about Kurosawa?

00:09:58.129 --> 00:10:00.768
Hang on, you're only
dropping the "-kun" off?

00:10:00.868 --> 00:10:02.839
Man, that's harsh, Mei.

00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:05.611
<i>[Mei] Get off of it! This</i>
<i>is a big step for me!</i>

00:10:05.711 --> 00:10:10.721
<i>I'm not going to start</i>
<i>being rude to people just</i>
<i>because I'm dating somebody.</i>

00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:14.596
[Yamato] All right... We'll
take it one step at a time.

00:10:14.696 --> 00:10:19.839
But... I'm hoping you tell
me you love me. Some day.

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:22.077
[Nagi knocks at the door]

00:10:22.177 --> 00:10:24.148
[Nagi] Big brother,
I'm coming in.

00:10:32.330 --> 00:10:35.036
Wha-what are you...

00:10:35.136 --> 00:10:37.608
[Nagi] No, big brother is...
[Yamato] H-hey, wait!

00:10:37.708 --> 00:10:40.815
My Big brother's in danger!

00:10:45.891 --> 00:10:48.564
[Yamato] I told you,
nothing happened.

00:10:48.664 --> 00:10:51.736
You big liar! She
was attacking you!

00:10:52.738 --> 00:10:55.678
Listen... You're
getting it all wrong.

00:10:55.778 --> 00:10:57.815
I don't think so.

00:10:58.517 --> 00:10:59.953
Don't get ahead of yourself!

00:11:00.053 --> 00:11:02.324
I'll never accept you as
my brother's girlfriend!

00:11:02.424 --> 00:11:03.660
And you can't make me!

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.196
[Yamato] Nagi! That's enough!

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:09.004
Now apologize.

00:11:14.448 --> 00:11:15.483
[Nagi] No.

00:11:15.584 --> 00:11:17.287
Fine. Go to your room then.

00:11:32.685 --> 00:11:34.054
Sorry about that.

00:11:35.356 --> 00:11:37.460
It's okay.

00:11:38.697 --> 00:11:42.070
She really doesn't normally
act up like this.

00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:44.509
But she's been this
way for six months,

00:11:44.609 --> 00:11:46.345
and hasn't gone to school.

00:11:51.255 --> 00:11:54.094
She used to bring friends
over all the time,

00:11:54.194 --> 00:11:56.365
but she's even
stopped doing that.

00:11:56.465 --> 00:11:58.737
We still haven't
figured out why.

00:12:00.139 --> 00:12:03.714
[Girl 1] Nagi-chan! Can we come
over to your place today?

00:12:03.814 --> 00:12:05.350
Yeah, alright!

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:07.220
[Girl 1] All right! Let's go!

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:10.728
[Girl 2] Count me in!
Nagi-chan's place is so nice.

00:12:10.828 --> 00:12:12.163
It's so big and fancy.

00:12:12.264 --> 00:12:14.434
[Girl 3] Can I come, too?
[Girl 1] It's okay, right?

00:12:14.535 --> 00:12:16.472
[Girl 1] You don't mind, do
you? The more, the merrier.

00:12:16.573 --> 00:12:18.242
Yeah, of course!

00:12:18.342 --> 00:12:22.785
<i>[Nagi] I used to be</i>
<i>surrounded by friends.</i>

00:12:22.885 --> 00:12:25.290
<i>They'd come over all the time.</i>

00:12:26.626 --> 00:12:27.828
Sorry to keep you waiting.

00:12:27.929 --> 00:12:28.931
[Girl 1] All right!

00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:30.400
[Girl 2] What? Seriously?

00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:34.007
[Girl 3] That one didn't
count. Let's go again. Again!

00:12:34.107 --> 00:12:38.349
<i>[Nagi] Though every time,</i>
<i>I felt like an outsider.</i>

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:42.190
[Girl 1] Nagi-chan, let's
hang out again today.

00:12:42.290 --> 00:12:45.664
<i>[Nagi] I was so happy when</i>
<i>they asked to hang out...</i>

00:12:45.764 --> 00:12:47.067
I know that game!

00:12:47.167 --> 00:12:49.204
It's the one where you dress
your avatar and fight.

00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:51.977
[Girl 1] Uh, yeah. I'm in the
middle of something important,

00:12:52.077 --> 00:12:53.379
so could you not talk to me?

00:12:53.479 --> 00:12:55.951
[Girl 3] Yes! I got a new
face! Oh, yeah. Sorry...

00:12:56.051 --> 00:12:57.153
[Girl 1] Seriously? No fair!

00:12:57.253 --> 00:12:59.358
[Girl 1] Right, Nagi-chan?
[Nagi] Huh?

00:12:59.458 --> 00:13:02.430
[Girl 2] You're really good
at making cookies, Nagi-chan.

00:13:02.531 --> 00:13:05.269
[The girls compliment Nagi on
her cookies and fawn over them]

00:13:05.370 --> 00:13:09.144
<i>[Nagi] I was happy when they</i>
<i>all smiled and complimented me.</i>

00:13:09.244 --> 00:13:10.413
<i>But...</i>

00:13:10.514 --> 00:13:13.019
[Girl 1] Hey, can we stop
by your place again today?

00:13:13.119 --> 00:13:17.494
[Nagi] Today, um... My relatives
are coming over, so...

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:19.464
[Girl 2] Oh, so we can't?

00:13:19.565 --> 00:13:21.402
[Nagi] I-I'm really
sorry about that.
[Girl 3] Seriously? Lame.

00:13:21.503 --> 00:13:24.341
[Girl 2] Man, we could
have played all the
games we wanted to.

00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:26.111
[Girl 3] And she always
gives us snacks.

00:13:26.211 --> 00:13:29.117
[Girl 1] Exactly. Why else
would we be her friends?

00:13:29.217 --> 00:13:30.888
[Girl 3] Oh, wow. You
said that out loud.

00:13:30.988 --> 00:13:32.324
[The girls all laugh]

00:13:33.527 --> 00:13:36.298
[Mrs. Kurosawa] Nagi, why
aren't you ready for school?

00:13:36.398 --> 00:13:38.937
[Nagi] My tummy hurts.
[Mrs. Kurosawa] Again?

00:13:39.037 --> 00:13:41.442
<i>[Nagi] Using the same</i>
<i>excuses over and over,</i>

00:13:41.543 --> 00:13:43.245
<i>I started skipping school.</i>

00:13:43.346 --> 00:13:46.385
Nagi, it's the phone.
Sounds like your friend.

00:13:46.485 --> 00:13:48.022
[Nagi] I don't want to talk.

00:13:59.311 --> 00:14:01.148
[Yamato] I wanted to
do something for her.

00:14:01.248 --> 00:14:04.488
And Nagi just wanted
to stay in her room.

00:14:06.559 --> 00:14:10.066
[Yamato being high-pitched] Hey,
Nagi? Are you awake?

00:14:11.703 --> 00:14:13.305
Boo.

00:14:13.406 --> 00:14:16.613
Get well soon, so you
can go to school.

00:14:18.315 --> 00:14:22.958
See? Rabbit Yamato's
worried about you, too.

00:14:23.059 --> 00:14:26.198
I'm your big brother.
Tell me anything, okay?

00:14:26.298 --> 00:14:28.369
Yeah.

00:14:28.469 --> 00:14:33.847
<i>[Nagi] Since then, he's</i>
<i>been my brother when my</i>
<i>big brother's not around.</i>

00:14:34.649 --> 00:14:37.955
It's not fair. I
forgot Yamato 2.

00:14:39.525 --> 00:14:40.594
Mei?

00:14:42.330 --> 00:14:42.965
What's wrong?

00:14:43.065 --> 00:14:45.036
N-Nothing really.

00:14:53.754 --> 00:14:54.889
It's good...

00:14:54.989 --> 00:14:57.060
Isn't it? Nagi made it.

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.397
[Mei] She made this delicious
cake by herself?

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:00.701
It isn't just cake.

00:15:00.801 --> 00:15:05.042
Let's see. Figurines, dioramas,
art work, you name it.

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:07.013
Her room is like a museum.

00:15:07.113 --> 00:15:09.652
The walls and shelves are
full of stuff that she's made.

00:15:09.752 --> 00:15:10.988
Wow...

00:15:11.088 --> 00:15:13.459
[Yamato's phone vibrates]

00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:15.631
Huh? Uh... Yeah?

00:15:15.731 --> 00:15:17.200
Yeah, hey Nakanishi. What's up?

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.404
[Nakanishi] I'm on my
way home from a date.
[Yamato] Huh?

00:15:20.473 --> 00:15:23.078
[Nakanishi] With
Asamicchi, of course!

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:26.318
So, we actually
bought you a gift.

00:15:26.418 --> 00:15:29.224
[Yamato] You want me to
come get it? Right now?

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.663
Why? Huh?

00:15:31.763 --> 00:15:33.834
You're a knucklehead,
you know that?

00:15:33.934 --> 00:15:35.971
Wha? He hung up.

00:15:36.071 --> 00:15:38.209
Sorry, Mei! Do you
mind if I step out?

00:15:38.309 --> 00:15:40.747
I've gotta hop on my bike,
but I-I'll be back in a minute.

00:15:40.848 --> 00:15:42.217
Sure, it's fine.

00:15:42.317 --> 00:15:44.254
[Yamato] Look after Kuro
and Marshmallow for me.

00:15:45.456 --> 00:15:46.693
Good god...

00:15:46.793 --> 00:15:48.395
Freaking Nakanishi!

00:15:52.403 --> 00:15:55.944
[The cats growl at each other]

00:15:58.884 --> 00:16:01.255
Don't fight, kitties.

00:16:01.355 --> 00:16:03.660
What's with the stare down?

00:16:11.275 --> 00:16:12.611
[Mei knocks at the door]

00:16:21.161 --> 00:16:26.973
[Mei] Um... He seemed to be
missing you after he got left
behind, so I thought maybe...

00:16:27.808 --> 00:16:30.213
Oh, thank you, Mei-san.

00:16:30.313 --> 00:16:32.952
[Mei] No, thank you, Nagi-san.
[Nagi] Huh?

00:16:33.052 --> 00:16:35.724
For the cake. It was
really delicious.

00:16:38.429 --> 00:16:41.503
I heard that you were really
good at making other stuff, too.

00:16:41.603 --> 00:16:44.207
That you can make
anything you want to.

00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:47.548
You're brother sounded
really proud of you.

00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:59.037
Wow...

00:16:59.137 --> 00:17:01.408
[Nagi] I make stuff when
I don't have anything to do,

00:17:01.509 --> 00:17:03.613
so I ended up with
all of these.

00:17:03.713 --> 00:17:07.353
[Mei] Awesome! You made
all of them yourself?

00:17:08.657 --> 00:17:09.692
It looks so real... Okay!

00:17:09.792 --> 00:17:12.297
I've never really seen
a bear up close before,

00:17:12.397 --> 00:17:16.371
but it's like something
bigger than reality
lives in here yanno?

00:17:16.471 --> 00:17:18.075
You don't need to exaggerate.

00:17:18.175 --> 00:17:19.612
Anyone can make a stuffed animal

00:17:19.712 --> 00:17:22.785
by looking up instructions
in a book, or on the internet.

00:17:22.885 --> 00:17:26.158
No, really! I know for a fact
that not everyone can do it!

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.797
[Nagi] It's easy.
[Mei] When I was your age,

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:31.803
I tried picking up a cookbook
making cookies once...

00:17:31.903 --> 00:17:33.405
And it was easy, right?

00:17:33.506 --> 00:17:35.978
I thought I followed all of
the directions to the letter.

00:17:36.078 --> 00:17:40.787
And I did everything I could to
make them just like in the book.

00:17:40.887 --> 00:17:41.990
[Mrs. Tachibana] They look nice.

00:17:42.090 --> 00:17:44.595
Your father is going
to love them.

00:17:44.695 --> 00:17:47.200
[Mei] You-you think so?

00:17:47.300 --> 00:17:51.375
You could really tell it
was my first attempt...

00:17:51.475 --> 00:17:52.243
Still...

00:17:52.343 --> 00:17:54.749
[Mr. Tachibana yells]

00:17:54.849 --> 00:17:56.920
My father broke his front teeth.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.088
That can't be!

00:17:58.188 --> 00:17:59.659
It's sad, but true.

00:17:59.759 --> 00:18:01.763
It was the birth of
the weaponized cookie.

00:18:01.863 --> 00:18:04.100
And the trauma kept me
from baking anything ever.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.906
[Nagi] Hey! Don't give
Yamato 2 any weird energy!

00:18:07.006 --> 00:18:09.044
[Mei] Uh! Sorry!

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:11.415
You say his name is Yamato 2?

00:18:11.516 --> 00:18:13.485
It's because my brother
gave him to me.

00:18:13.586 --> 00:18:16.759
This rabbit...
He's my best friend.

00:18:16.859 --> 00:18:18.697
[Mei] Your friend, huh?

00:18:18.797 --> 00:18:22.705
I was thinking, I'd sure
like to make more friends
than I already have now.

00:18:22.805 --> 00:18:25.811
But Mei-san, isn't my
brother your boyfriend?

00:18:25.911 --> 00:18:27.246
Isn't that enough for you?

00:18:27.347 --> 00:18:29.351
[Mei] That's not it.
If anything, I think

00:18:29.451 --> 00:18:32.825
I want more friends and people
in my life because of him.

00:18:36.933 --> 00:18:42.410
Nagi-san... I used to hate
people because they're so
quick to betray each other.

00:18:42.511 --> 00:18:44.982
They'll say they're your
friends, but then ignore you

00:18:45.082 --> 00:18:49.290
or even shun you when it
stops being convenient
or fun for them.

00:18:49.391 --> 00:18:51.395
I didn't wanna have
friends like that.

00:18:51.495 --> 00:18:53.800
And I thought I didn't
need them.

00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:55.837
Yeah, I agree.

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:57.574
They use you as
much as they can,

00:18:57.675 --> 00:19:01.081
then once they're done with
you, they all disappear.

00:19:01.181 --> 00:19:02.951
I don't need friends either!

00:19:03.052 --> 00:19:04.354
I hate everyone!

00:19:04.454 --> 00:19:07.060
I thought that, but
you know what, Nagi?

00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:08.897
It wasn't right at all.

00:19:13.138 --> 00:19:17.213
I thought I was stronger,
rejecting relationships
and friends.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:19.518
But once you reject
people, you're stuck.

00:19:19.618 --> 00:19:23.827
You lose the opportunity
to make those connections
that define your life.

00:19:23.927 --> 00:19:27.701
And when you've lost
those chances, you
don't get them back.

00:19:27.801 --> 00:19:32.377
Someday, maybe you'll
find someone like you
to share your pain with.

00:19:32.477 --> 00:19:36.051
I can't tell you when that'll
happen or who it's gonna be,

00:19:36.151 --> 00:19:39.457
but I do know this. That person
is going to be really special

00:19:39.558 --> 00:19:42.397
to you and you have
to be ready for them.

00:19:42.497 --> 00:19:45.069
When you meet them,
don't turn them away.

00:19:45.169 --> 00:19:47.808
That's what Kurosawa-kun
helped me see.

00:19:49.879 --> 00:19:54.755
Nagi-san, you like to create
things when you're bored,
isn't that right?

00:19:54.855 --> 00:19:57.427
Okay. Here's what I think.
I bet you're gonna find

00:19:57.528 --> 00:20:00.466
someone else who's out there
who's just as creative.

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:04.809
[Birds chirp loudly]

00:20:25.884 --> 00:20:26.652
What is it?

00:20:26.753 --> 00:20:27.821
The-the cats!

00:20:27.921 --> 00:20:29.057
In Kurosawa's room!

00:20:29.157 --> 00:20:31.261
I forgot all about
Marshmallow and Kuro!

00:20:35.336 --> 00:20:37.273
Oh, thank goodness.

00:20:37.373 --> 00:20:40.413
I can't believe I forgot
to look in on them...

00:20:40.514 --> 00:20:41.983
You're so dramatic.

00:20:48.262 --> 00:20:49.832
Take it.

00:20:49.932 --> 00:20:51.268
[Mei] You're sure?

00:20:55.644 --> 00:20:59.952
I wonder... do you think
I can make friends again?

00:21:01.956 --> 00:21:03.392
You can.

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:08.302
Let's do our best!

00:21:08.402 --> 00:21:10.674
[Nagi] What are you doing?
[Mei] No, wait. I...

00:21:10.774 --> 00:21:13.212
[Nagi] You're still doing it!
[Mei] I uh... It's a reflex.

00:21:13.312 --> 00:21:14.447
It's not on purpose.

00:21:14.548 --> 00:21:16.853
My desire is to try
hard subconsciously.

00:21:16.953 --> 00:21:19.023
[Nagi laughs] Okay, weirdo!

00:21:20.259 --> 00:21:21.596
[Yamato] I'm home!

00:21:23.198 --> 00:21:25.504
Thanks for waiting!

00:21:25.604 --> 00:21:28.208
I've brought some stuff home
from the Hokkaido Festival.

00:21:28.308 --> 00:21:29.912
From Nakanishi and Asami...

00:21:30.012 --> 00:21:32.618
Um... Huh?

00:21:34.655 --> 00:21:35.790
Uh...

00:21:41.034 --> 00:21:45.442
So what in the world were you
guys up to when I was gone?

00:21:51.656 --> 00:21:54.427
I'm not exactly sure
what you did, but...

00:21:55.997 --> 00:21:57.968
Thank you, Mei.

00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:32.991
[Mei] If only I
could stop time...

00:23:33.091 --> 00:23:36.197
Everyone's wished for that
at some point in their lives.

00:23:36.298 --> 00:23:39.237
Even in difficult times, it's
important to hold on to the joy

00:23:39.337 --> 00:23:40.807
of being connected to others.

00:23:40.907 --> 00:23:44.848
[Marshmellow] That's really deep
Mei, now put me down. Meow.
