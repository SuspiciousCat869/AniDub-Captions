00:00:18.303 --> 00:00:20.575
[Teacher] Yesterday,
our class rabbit died.

00:00:20.675 --> 00:00:23.380
It seems it ate something
it shouldn't have.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.589
And I would like to know
if any of you can tell me
what happened.

00:00:28.423 --> 00:00:30.127
[Boy 1] I bet they did it.

00:00:30.227 --> 00:00:32.064
[Boy 2] Yeah! I saw those
three girls over there

00:00:32.164 --> 00:00:34.536
goofing around the
rabbit cage yesterday.

00:00:34.636 --> 00:00:38.476
[Girl 1] Well, that was
because M-Mei-chan...

00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:42.151
She said it'd eat anything,
so we should feed it something.

00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:45.592
[GIrl 2] We said we didn't want
to, but she made us do it.

00:00:47.394 --> 00:00:48.898
[Young Mei] No, it wasn't me...

00:00:48.998 --> 00:00:50.802
I-I didn't do anything...

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.414
Why are you all doing this?

00:01:24.135 --> 00:01:26.139
Good morning, Marshmallow.

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:42.204
[Mrs. Tachibana] Mei, don't
leave the water on while
you're washing your hair.

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:54.028
I put up a wind chime.

00:01:54.128 --> 00:01:56.634
It's kind of summery.

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:58.938
[Mei] Kind of late for
that, isn't it?

00:01:59.038 --> 00:02:02.211
[Mrs. Tachibana] You should know
by now, it's never too late.

00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:05.017
"Nothing starts till you begin."

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:06.185
[Mei] What's that?

00:02:06.285 --> 00:02:08.089
[Mrs. Tachibana] A quote
from a song.

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:09.125
Uh-huh.

00:02:09.225 --> 00:02:10.561
[Marshmallow meows]

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.335
[Mei] Oh. Yeah,
I'll feed you too.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.717
[Mei] Later, Mom!

00:02:21.817 --> 00:02:23.086
Be careful out there.

00:02:23.186 --> 00:02:28.296
[footsteps]
[door opening and closing]

00:02:33.607 --> 00:02:38.183
[classical music playing
on Mei's MP3 player]

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:03.901
Another year.

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.970
Just watch out for the old guy

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:06.105
who's teaching our homeroom.

00:03:06.205 --> 00:03:09.546
Hey, hey. Look,
it's Rabbit Girl.

00:03:09.646 --> 00:03:13.788
[Girls laugh]

00:03:13.888 --> 00:03:25.444
[song crescendos]

00:03:35.397 --> 00:03:37.401
[Girl A] Hey Tachibana.

00:03:39.238 --> 00:03:42.411
Still single after all these
years, Tachibana?

00:03:47.488 --> 00:03:48.958
Wow, ignoring us?

00:03:49.058 --> 00:03:51.229
You know, you can't ask a girl
like that about her love life.

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.168
Oh yeah, sweet 16 and
never been kissed!

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:57.675
[girls laugh]

00:03:57.776 --> 00:04:02.017
<i>[Mei] Freakin' lameoids.</i>
<i>I haven't had any friends,</i>

00:04:02.117 --> 00:04:04.790
<i>let alone a boyfriend,</i>
<i>for 16 years.</i>

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.327
<i>And I plan to keep</i>
<i>on beating my record.</i>

00:04:07.428 --> 00:04:11.970
<i>I've been in a few groups of</i>
<i>people who called themselves</i>
<i>my friends.</i>

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.341
<i>But I finally figured it out.</i>

00:04:14.442 --> 00:04:16.747
<i>All they've ever done</i>
<i>is hurt me.</i>

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:22.625
<i>I'm better off by myself.</i>

00:04:22.725 --> 00:04:26.499
[Nakanishi] Geeze, I can't
believe that crap from
yesterday.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.577
Word on the street is Seino's
chaulk full of busty babes with
bodacious tata's,

00:04:31.677 --> 00:04:35.317
I get my A game going but they
all pounced on you instead!

00:04:35.417 --> 00:04:36.486
[Yamato] They did?

00:04:36.587 --> 00:04:38.691
Man, it was going on
all around you.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:42.431
Even the hotest of the
hotties wanted to climb
all over you, boy.

00:04:42.532 --> 00:04:46.105
And all I got to do is stand
there and watch.

00:04:46.205 --> 00:04:47.809
Sorry about that, okay?

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:50.915
[Nakanishi] So? Did you
get her number?

00:04:51.015 --> 00:04:52.084
Not really.

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:53.721
What the hell's wrong
with you, man?

00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:55.791
It's not like I had
to ask for it, okay?

00:04:55.892 --> 00:04:59.699
She was practically begging you
to ask her for her phone
number, dude.

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:01.670
[Nakanishi] What a waste.
[Yamato] You sure?

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:05.645
I mean, she just looks like
all the other girls I see all
the time.

00:05:05.745 --> 00:05:09.886
Aah. Don't get on your high
horse with me, Yamato Kurosawa.

00:05:09.986 --> 00:05:14.128
Somewhere in that chick magnet
body of yours is a predetor
waiting to jump out.

00:05:14.228 --> 00:05:15.330
Is that sarcasm?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.465
[Nakanishi] Don't tell me

00:05:16.567 --> 00:05:17.802
all the girls look the
same to you.

00:05:17.902 --> 00:05:19.773
[Yamato] Heh.
[Nakanishi] You don't fool me.

00:05:19.873 --> 00:05:21.409
[Yamato] But they're all
equal in my eyes.

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.079
[Asami] Yamato!

00:05:24.481 --> 00:05:26.753
Good morning!

00:05:28.858 --> 00:05:30.093
Asamicchi!

00:05:31.262 --> 00:05:32.765
Where were you last night?

00:05:32.866 --> 00:05:34.803
I tried calling you, but
you didn't answer.

00:05:34.903 --> 00:05:37.809
I was out having dinner with
some girls from Seino High.

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:40.982
Aw! You should've called
me to come along with you!

00:05:41.082 --> 00:05:44.088
Sorry. I promise I'll give
you a call next time.

00:05:44.188 --> 00:05:46.593
You mean it? Okay.

00:05:46.693 --> 00:05:49.733
And we should all go to
karaoke sometime, right?

00:05:49.833 --> 00:05:50.768
Sure.

00:05:50.868 --> 00:05:52.337
Okay! See ya!

00:05:55.578 --> 00:05:57.815
[Yamato] Nakanishi,
what are you doing?

00:05:57.916 --> 00:06:01.924
[Nakanishi] Whatever. Are you
trying to take Asamicchi from
me, too?

00:06:02.024 --> 00:06:03.661
Huh?

00:06:03.761 --> 00:06:05.130
You're not getting it, are you?

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.502
Asamicchi's my angel, man!

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:08.871
And those boobs of
her's are amazing!

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:11.108
Is that all you ever
look at, Takashi?

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:12.144
Of course not!

00:06:12.244 --> 00:06:13.948
It isn't just her rack, dude!

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:15.383
Asamicchi is...

00:06:17.822 --> 00:06:19.491
[Nakanishi] Sorry about that.

00:06:23.968 --> 00:06:27.642
Take it easy. It was
an accident, okay?

00:06:35.558 --> 00:06:37.427
Man, that was awkward.

00:06:37.528 --> 00:06:38.564
Who is she?

00:06:38.664 --> 00:06:40.801
You haven't seen her around?

00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:44.676
That's Mei Tachibana.
Got her in my class.

00:06:46.012 --> 00:06:50.420
I don't know what her deal
is, dude. Keeps to herself.

00:06:50.521 --> 00:06:52.157
Never talks to anybody.

00:06:52.257 --> 00:06:56.132
I bet you 500 yen no one's ever
heard the sound of her voice.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:57.234
No that I want to.

00:06:57.334 --> 00:06:58.671
[Yamato] Hmm...

00:07:05.116 --> 00:07:06.586
[Yamato] She's kind of...

00:07:08.222 --> 00:07:09.559
...interesting.

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.697
[school bell rings]

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:19.813
What's the point of these
morning assemblies anyway?

00:07:21.248 --> 00:07:22.484
[Nakanishi] Hey!

00:07:22.585 --> 00:07:25.524
Stop right there!
Pleated skirt bingo!

00:07:25.625 --> 00:07:27.996
[Girl 1] Knock it off!
[Girl 2] You little pervert!
[Nakanishi] Hey, I'm not the one

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:30.501
[Nakanishi] showing their butt
off to the entire school!

00:07:30.601 --> 00:07:32.572
Come on, don't be a jerk, man.

00:07:32.672 --> 00:07:34.408
Just giving some
friendly advice!

00:07:34.509 --> 00:07:36.747
If you keep on wearing
your skirts short like that,

00:07:36.847 --> 00:07:39.953
you might end up being
victimized by a real prevert!

00:07:40.053 --> 00:07:42.925
[Girl 2] Drop dead, you jackass!
[Girl 1] You bastard!

00:07:43.026 --> 00:07:48.637
So tell me, Yamato, was that
thing with girls from Seino High
a mixer? Tell me.

00:07:48.737 --> 00:07:51.108
Uh, not really. We just grabbed
something to eat.

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:54.281
[Girl 3] But that's not fair.
You should go out with us.

00:07:54.381 --> 00:07:56.485
[Yamato] Yeah, I will. Soon.

00:07:56.586 --> 00:07:57.588
[Girl 4] All right!

00:07:57.689 --> 00:07:59.124
[Girl 3] We're holding
you to it!

00:07:59.224 --> 00:08:00.327
[girls laugh]

00:08:00.427 --> 00:08:02.230
[Nakanishi] Hot legs
at three o'clock.

00:08:02.331 --> 00:08:04.736
That long skirt
isn't fooling me.

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:13.587
Who do you belong
to, mystery skirt?

00:08:15.825 --> 00:08:18.597
What? Oh. You've got
to be kidding me.

00:08:18.697 --> 00:08:21.703
Hey, Takashi, knock
it off, will ya?

00:08:39.004 --> 00:08:43.847
[Girls] Yamato! Oh my gosh!
Are you okay!? What happened?

00:08:43.947 --> 00:08:45.751
Kurosawa?

00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:50.093
[Mei] Another "accident".
Isn't that right?

00:08:50.193 --> 00:08:51.930
Keep your hands off!

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.299
Got it, asshole?!

00:08:55.203 --> 00:08:56.305
I hope you die!

00:08:56.405 --> 00:08:58.209
[Girl 1] She's so mean!

00:08:58.309 --> 00:09:00.413
Nakanishi's the one who did it.

00:09:00.514 --> 00:09:02.084
[Girl 3] Are you okay?

00:09:04.121 --> 00:09:05.624
[Yamato laughs]

00:09:05.725 --> 00:09:07.461
Ow... [continues laughing]

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:09.666
Did you hit your head
or something?

00:09:12.170 --> 00:09:13.774
<i>Mei Tachibana.</i>

00:09:27.067 --> 00:09:28.336
[Boy 1] Let's go home together.

00:09:28.436 --> 00:09:29.672
[Boy 2] Huh? Don't you
have club?

00:09:29.773 --> 00:09:30.541
[Boy 1] Not today.

00:09:30.641 --> 00:09:32.210
[Boy 2] Oh, okay.

00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:34.081
[Girl 1] What's her problem?

00:09:34.181 --> 00:09:36.620
[Girl 2] Who does she
think she is anyway?

00:09:52.585 --> 00:09:53.921
[Yamato] Miss Tachibana?

00:09:54.889 --> 00:09:56.793
Miss Mei Tachibana?

00:09:58.296 --> 00:09:59.632
Truce, okay?

00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:07.648
[Mei] Okay. What do you want?

00:10:07.748 --> 00:10:09.384
I'd like to apologize, okay?

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:12.658
[Mei] Apologize? For what?

00:10:12.758 --> 00:10:15.598
My friend back there
was a little imature.

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:20.508
Nakanishi, the guy who was
playing with your skirt,

00:10:20.608 --> 00:10:21.910
he's a friend of mine.

00:10:22.010 --> 00:10:24.114
He said you were in
the same homeroom.

00:10:24.214 --> 00:10:27.254
[Mei] I wouldn't know. I don't
really talk to my classmates.

00:10:27.354 --> 00:10:31.963
He's kind of girl-crazy, but
he's pretty harmless, if you
know what I mean.

00:10:32.063 --> 00:10:34.769
Not a lot of fun for
you, though.

00:10:34.869 --> 00:10:37.742
[Yamato] I just want you
to know, I'm sorry.

00:10:37.842 --> 00:10:42.518
[Mei] Okay, well,
I'm sorry, too.

00:10:42.618 --> 00:10:45.223
S-Sorry for accidentally
kicking you.

00:10:46.726 --> 00:10:48.229
[Yamato starts laughing]
Sorry.

00:10:48.329 --> 00:10:51.503
I mean really, that was
one heck of a roundhouse.

00:10:51.603 --> 00:10:55.310
[Yamato continues laughing]

00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:57.480
I'm sorry. Really.

00:10:57.582 --> 00:10:59.051
Yeah. Can I go now?

00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:02.758
You know, you're really pretty
fun, when you think about it.

00:11:02.859 --> 00:11:06.365
[Mei] Define "fun". Fun
to pick on and ridicule?

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:08.002
[Yamato] No. Of course not.

00:11:08.102 --> 00:11:11.910
I just think it'd be fun to get
to know you better. That's all.

00:11:12.645 --> 00:11:14.214
[Mei] I don't understand.

00:11:14.314 --> 00:11:17.555
[Yamato] What I mean is...
How do I put this...

00:11:17.655 --> 00:11:19.258
[Mei] Enough already.

00:11:29.344 --> 00:11:31.550
