WEBVTT

00:00:06.012 --> 00:00:07.582
[Aiko] Day three
is gonna suck...

00:00:07.682 --> 00:00:10.855
Things are gonna start
sucking for me on day one.

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:11.991
[Footsteps]

00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.628
Good... morning.

00:00:13.728 --> 00:00:15.197
Mornin'. What's going on?

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.969
I can't believe you're actually
stepping up and greeting us.

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:20.474
Well... It's something new...

00:00:20.575 --> 00:00:23.346
After class, wanna
hit the tea shop?

00:00:23.446 --> 00:00:26.286
[Asami] Yeah, let's go!
We haven't been able
to talk much lately,

00:00:26.386 --> 00:00:29.191
and I'll go anywhere
as long as I can get
something sweet to eat.

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:31.229
[Aiko] All you want
to eat is sweets.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:33.066
[Asami] That's not it.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.605
Thanks a lot. I mean it.

00:00:35.705 --> 00:00:39.513
You know. I was really starting
to worry again about...

00:00:39.613 --> 00:00:40.949
being left alone.

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:42.284
Really? Oh, no way!

00:00:42.384 --> 00:00:45.023
What are you talking
about? You're goofy.

00:00:45.123 --> 00:00:47.328
Ah! Good morning, Yamato.

00:00:47.428 --> 00:00:49.666
Morning.

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:51.402
Morning.

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:53.206
Hm? What? What?

00:00:53.306 --> 00:00:54.610
Um, it's nothing...

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.878
There is something!

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:57.515
[Aiko] Spit it out, Tachibana!

00:00:57.616 --> 00:01:00.622
Something must have
happened between you guys.

00:01:00.722 --> 00:01:03.193
[Megumi] Karaoke tonight?
[Girl 1] Again?

00:01:03.293 --> 00:01:05.063
[Megumi] I'm feeling irritated.

00:01:05.163 --> 00:01:08.136
[Girl 1] Then, let's
blow off some steam.

00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:10.173
What do you want to sing?

00:01:10.274 --> 00:01:13.246
They've got a couple new songs
that I really want to sing.

00:01:13.346 --> 00:01:15.384
That's cool. You sing so good.

00:01:15.484 --> 00:01:17.121
[Girl 2] My friend
wants to come, too.

00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:19.559
[Girl 1] If we invite too many
people, it'll bother Megu.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.064
[Megumi] Oh, it's fine. I don't
care how many people come.

00:01:22.164 --> 00:01:25.304
[Girl 1] Really?
Megu, you're so cool!

00:03:05.738 --> 00:03:06.874
[Yamato] Mei.

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:09.178
Say, "Ah."

00:03:12.151 --> 00:03:15.123
Oh, that proves that
you're a masochist.

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:16.492
When something is
presented to you,

00:03:16.593 --> 00:03:18.564
if you look down,
you're a masochist,

00:03:18.664 --> 00:03:20.033
and if you look up,
you're a sadist.

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:21.704
[Mei] That doesn't
prove anything!

00:03:21.804 --> 00:03:23.808
I looked away!

00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:25.645
Oh, right. I found a hotel.

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:28.316
All the nearby rooms were
full, and no one canceled.

00:03:28.416 --> 00:03:29.720
But this one has a shuttlebus.

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.955
Oh, uh...

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:34.863
Does that not work?

00:03:34.963 --> 00:03:38.571
No, I'm just a little nervous...

00:03:38.671 --> 00:03:41.610
So am I. When I think
about being with you,

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:42.879
I get nervous.

00:03:45.852 --> 00:03:47.020
[Kai] Thanks for the food.

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:49.158
Hey! That was pretty
cool, Takemura.

00:03:49.258 --> 00:03:51.362
Kurosawa, dude. That's amazing.

00:03:51.462 --> 00:03:53.099
[Kai] Thanks...
[Megumi] Oh, right.

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.301
So, at my shoot the other day...

00:03:54.402 --> 00:03:56.372
[Kai] Hey, Megumi Kitagawa!

00:03:59.679 --> 00:04:03.420
What the hell? I hear you've
been giving Tachibana
a lot of grief.

00:04:03.521 --> 00:04:06.058
[Megumi] I haven't done
anything to that girl.
[Kai] What?

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:09.098
And while we're at it, what
kind of guy goes and confesses

00:04:09.198 --> 00:04:10.835
his feelings for a
friend's girlfriend?

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:14.175
Sounds like you're doing
more grief giving than
I am, Takemura.

00:04:14.275 --> 00:04:18.784
I spoke my piece and took my
chances, and our friendship
managed to survive it.

00:04:18.884 --> 00:04:21.088
Better than lying about
it, if you ask me.

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:25.598
[Kai] You know all about that.
[Megumi] And you're that honest?

00:04:25.698 --> 00:04:29.305
[Kai] I try. How are
things going for you?
[Megumi] What do you mean?

00:04:29.405 --> 00:04:32.377
[Kai] I mean with Yamato.
[Megumi] As if.

00:04:32.478 --> 00:04:34.415
[Kai] Do you really like him?
[Megumi] What?

00:04:34.516 --> 00:04:37.020
[Kai] You seem to be focusing
all your attention on everyone

00:04:37.121 --> 00:04:38.624
else instead of Yamato.

00:04:38.724 --> 00:04:42.364
Maybe you really don't
like him that much.

00:04:42.464 --> 00:04:45.938
You can't accept that he likes
someone else more than you.

00:04:46.038 --> 00:04:49.513
You're not happy unless you're
always the center of attention.

00:04:49.613 --> 00:04:52.519
You really don't like anybody,
do you, Kitagawa?

00:04:52.619 --> 00:04:55.591
Don't act like you know me!

00:04:55.691 --> 00:04:59.966
I work hard to make others
happy, and I value them.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.639
What's wrong with wanting
something for myself?

00:05:02.739 --> 00:05:06.045
Nothing at all. But don't do
it at other people's expense.

00:05:06.145 --> 00:05:10.387
All that pettiness?
It's a waste.

00:05:10.487 --> 00:05:13.861
Kitagawa, you'd be better off
putting all that energy...

00:05:13.961 --> 00:05:15.998
into your modeling career.

00:05:20.608 --> 00:05:24.448
<i>[Megumi] Yeah, that's what</i>
<i>everyone wants me to do.</i>

00:05:24.549 --> 00:05:26.787
<i>But if I don't work harder</i>
<i>than everyone else,</i>

00:05:26.887 --> 00:05:29.291
<i>and have all my bases covered</i>
<i>all the time,</i>

00:05:29.391 --> 00:05:32.532
<i>no one will ever</i>
<i>treat me as an equal.</i>

00:05:32.632 --> 00:05:35.705
[Asami] What should we get?
[Aiko] Hmm...

00:05:35.805 --> 00:05:37.942
[Asami] Ooh! What about this?
[Aiko] Eh.

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:40.447
Huh? Maybe that one?

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:42.619
Are you really thinking
about this seriously?

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:44.523
Of course I am, fluff brain.

00:05:44.623 --> 00:05:46.025
But condoms would
be more practical.

00:05:46.125 --> 00:05:49.198
[Asami] Aiko-chan!
[Megumi] Hey, whacha
talking about?

00:05:49.298 --> 00:05:53.641
Ah, Megu-tan! I bet you'd
know your gift. Which one
would you give them?

00:05:53.741 --> 00:05:55.878
Mei and Yamato are spending
their first night together.

00:05:55.978 --> 00:05:58.551
[Asami] So it's gotta be
something really special.

00:06:01.657 --> 00:06:04.361
[Megumi] Forget about that junk!
There's a big fashion show

00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:06.299
called the Tokyo
Collection coming up.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:08.036
Why don't you guys come with me?

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:09.338
I can bring two guests.

00:06:09.438 --> 00:06:11.409
The after party'll
knock your socks off.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:13.379
I know I'm gonna gorge myself.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.089
[Asami] Wouldn't that mean
we'd... go without Mei-chan?

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:22.565
Darn. I guess I'll have
to endure the pain of
not going to the show.

00:06:22.665 --> 00:06:24.201
I guess Tachibana
can go in my place.

00:06:24.301 --> 00:06:28.711
Waaait, what? I can't go to
something like that without you.

00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:29.713
I'll live.

00:06:29.813 --> 00:06:32.251
[Asami] No, I want
to go with everyone.

00:06:32.351 --> 00:06:35.858
[Aiko] Yeah, I understand that,
but it's just not the kind of
thing I get into, okay?

00:06:35.958 --> 00:06:40.668
Come on... If you really
want to come to the show,

00:06:40.768 --> 00:06:42.972
let's just make it happen.
<i>What's your problem anyway?</i>

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:44.976
<i>Quit the pretense and</i>
<i>make up your mind.</i>

00:06:45.076 --> 00:06:47.281
Just think of all the fun you'll
be missing out on if you let

00:06:47.381 --> 00:06:50.521
Tachibana go instead of you.
<i>I'm not going to spend an</i>
<i>afternoon with that freakshow.</i>

00:06:50.621 --> 00:06:54.729
Why the hell is everyone always
going on about Mei Tachibana
anyway? Goddammit!

00:06:54.829 --> 00:06:56.265
I'm telling you to go with me.

00:06:56.365 --> 00:06:57.702
[Aiko] Enough!

00:06:59.572 --> 00:07:02.411
Do we look like those fangirls
who follow you around?

00:07:02.512 --> 00:07:05.918
I'm not gonna wag my tail
like a little dog for YOU.

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.491
What? I didn't say that.

00:07:09.592 --> 00:07:11.897
[Aiko] Your queen bitch of
the universe act says it all.

00:07:11.997 --> 00:07:14.536
The price of indulging
you is too goddamn high.

00:07:14.636 --> 00:07:17.474
Why do you need to make people
like you anyway, Kitagawa?

00:07:17.575 --> 00:07:19.813
[Boy 1] Lame-o!
[Boy 2] Bigfoot!

00:07:19.913 --> 00:07:23.954
[Boy 3] You're in the back
because you're the ugliest!

00:07:24.054 --> 00:07:27.862
[Teacher] Kitagawa-san,
either cut your hair
or tie it up neatly.

00:07:27.962 --> 00:07:30.968
I'm going to have to tell
your mother about this.

00:07:31.068 --> 00:07:33.907
[Megumi] I'm home.
[Ms. Kitagawa] Ah,
I'm about to go to work.

00:07:34.008 --> 00:07:36.947
[Ms. Kitagawa] Eat whatever
you want for dinner, okay?

00:07:47.735 --> 00:07:50.473
<i>[Boy 3] You're in the back</i>
<i>because you're the ugliest.</i>

00:07:54.816 --> 00:07:56.987
[Megumi] Hey, I
didn't invite you.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.262
[Hiro] I invited her.

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:04.669
What? Don't just do
whatever you want.

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.107
Okay. I'm outta here.

00:08:07.207 --> 00:08:10.213
[Megumi] Huh? Are you saying you
like Momo-chan more than me?

00:08:10.313 --> 00:08:12.785
Aren't you having fun with me?

00:08:12.885 --> 00:08:15.658
I took you out to eat.
Why are you doing this?

00:08:15.758 --> 00:08:17.194
Aren't we friends?

00:08:17.294 --> 00:08:18.630
[Hiro] Friends?

00:08:19.733 --> 00:08:22.672
Get it right. We're here
because YOU'RE here...

00:08:22.772 --> 00:08:24.008
picking up the tab.

00:08:24.108 --> 00:08:27.648
We're broke. You know
it, so don't pretend.

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:30.654
You're lucky. You're a celebrity
with too much money to burn.

00:08:30.755 --> 00:08:32.959
We get it. You're famous.

00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:35.831
But enough is enough already.

00:08:56.907 --> 00:08:58.744
[Izumi] The winter
collection looks good.

00:08:58.844 --> 00:09:01.048
Are you ready to knock
'em dead, Megu-tan?

00:09:01.148 --> 00:09:02.585
[Knocks at the door]

00:09:02.685 --> 00:09:04.221
[Manager] Izumi-chan, standby.

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:05.658
Okay!

00:09:15.611 --> 00:09:18.216
<i>[Girl 1] Megu-tan is so cute! I</i>
<i>wish I could be as thin as her.</i>

00:09:18.316 --> 00:09:20.821
<i>[Girl 2] I don't</i>
<i>really like Megu-tan.</i>
<i>[Boy 1] She's stubborn.</i>

00:09:20.921 --> 00:09:25.130
<i>[Boy 2] I think Megu-tan</i>
<i>has a bad personality.</i>

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.637
<i>[Man 1] People thinks she</i>
<i>looks good, but she's</i>
<i>the queen of plastic.</i>

00:09:28.737 --> 00:09:34.816
[The negative comments
continue on rapidly]

00:09:42.330 --> 00:09:44.168
[Megumi hits the table]

00:09:44.268 --> 00:09:46.005
[Knocking]

00:09:46.105 --> 00:09:47.240
Megu-tan, standby.

00:09:52.017 --> 00:09:53.654
[Line beeps]

00:09:53.754 --> 00:09:58.196
[Operator] The number you have
dialed is either turned off
or outside the servi-

00:09:59.632 --> 00:10:02.738
[Line beeps]

00:10:02.839 --> 00:10:05.009
[Operator] The number you have
dialed is either turned off or
[Hiro] We get it.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:06.513
[Hiro] But enough
is enough already.
[Operator] outside the service

00:10:06.613 --> 00:10:08.416
area, and your call
cannot be completed.

00:10:08.517 --> 00:10:10.888
Please check the
number and try again.

00:10:53.707 --> 00:10:55.811
[Megumi] How...

00:10:57.314 --> 00:10:59.351
How can I be happy?

00:11:09.171 --> 00:11:11.610
[Girl 1] That girl is cute.
[Girl 2] What class is she in?

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:12.879
[Girl 1] Is she wearing makeup?

00:11:12.979 --> 00:11:15.016
[Boy 1] No, I think
she's cute without it!

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:25.671
[Megumi] Do you have to
crowd me like this?

00:11:25.771 --> 00:11:26.773
I don't like it.

00:11:26.873 --> 00:11:28.544
[Boy] But you're so cute.

00:11:28.644 --> 00:11:30.413
And you've gotten cuter.

00:11:30.514 --> 00:11:31.983
Not to mention popular.

00:11:32.083 --> 00:11:34.589
<i>[Boy] You're in the back</i>
<i>because you're the ugliest.</i>

00:11:34.689 --> 00:11:38.764
[Megumi] Yeah, I know what
you want. And that's why
you're calling me cute.

00:11:38.864 --> 00:11:41.402
You're not kidding anybody.

00:11:41.503 --> 00:11:43.005
[Boy] Kitagawa?

00:11:44.007 --> 00:11:46.345
<i>[Megumi] I'm not cute.</i>

00:11:46.445 --> 00:11:48.817
<i>No one needs me.</i>

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:56.733
<i>That's why I've kept up the</i>
<i>"Megumi Kitagawa" act</i>
<i>in the first place.</i>

00:11:57.267 --> 00:11:58.436
<i>Cheerful.</i>

00:11:59.505 --> 00:12:00.406
<i>Cute.</i>

00:12:00.507 --> 00:12:02.110
<i>Megu-tan, the good girl.</i>

00:12:02.210 --> 00:12:04.515
<i>I've worked hard to</i>
<i>keep that image up.</i>

00:12:04.616 --> 00:12:07.220
<i>So everybody's happy</i>
<i>with Megu-tan.</i>

00:12:07.588 --> 00:12:08.957
<i>Why?</i>

00:12:10.728 --> 00:12:12.330
<i>What the hell for?!</i>

00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:13.800
<i>Damn it!</i>

00:12:21.650 --> 00:12:25.223
[Mei] Got my ticket.
Got my toiletries.

00:12:25.323 --> 00:12:26.893
What else do I need?

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.370
[Mei] Knock before
you open the door!

00:12:32.470 --> 00:12:35.310
[Ms. Tachibana laughs] It was
already open, dear.

00:12:49.906 --> 00:12:51.509
[Mei] Yamato!

00:12:52.243 --> 00:12:53.513
Mei!

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:01.529
Do I look weird?

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.704
[Yamato] No... I was just
wondering if you figured
out my tastes in clothes.

00:13:05.804 --> 00:13:11.348
Huh? Not really. I just
thought I should dress
like this sometimes.

00:13:11.448 --> 00:13:14.254
Oh, okay. I-it's cute.

00:13:15.991 --> 00:13:17.962
[Mei] I'm going to go change!
[Yamato] Don't!

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.366
Please don't.

00:13:30.587 --> 00:13:32.324
Are you asleep?

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:40.373
<i>[Mei] It's really...</i>

00:13:40.473 --> 00:13:42.243
<i>just us two.</i>

00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:44.281
<i>Oh wow.</i>

00:13:55.470 --> 00:13:56.606
Oh, a map...

00:13:56.706 --> 00:13:58.042
We're not gonna need it, Mei.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:00.013
The day officially
starts over...

00:14:00.113 --> 00:14:01.482
[Yamato] here!
[Mei] What?!

00:14:07.394 --> 00:14:09.264
[Excited screaming]

00:14:12.037 --> 00:14:14.609
[Yamato] Let's go there next!
[Mei] Huh?

00:14:14.709 --> 00:14:16.045
[Excited yelling]

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.619
[Yamato] Mei, let's
ride that, too!

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:20.788
[Mei] Uuh...

00:14:20.888 --> 00:14:22.223
[Excting shouting]

00:14:25.831 --> 00:14:29.371
Ah! I'm having so much fun.

00:14:29.471 --> 00:14:30.774
Is something wrong?

00:14:30.874 --> 00:14:32.611
Huh? What!?

00:14:32.712 --> 00:14:34.515
You don't like riding
rollercoasters?

00:14:34.615 --> 00:14:35.718
I'm so sorry!

00:14:35.818 --> 00:14:39.324
[Mei] No, no...
Don't a-apologize.

00:14:39.424 --> 00:14:41.696
[Yamato] Mei, you should
tell me if you don't
want to do something.

00:14:41.796 --> 00:14:43.265
[Mei] That's not it!

00:14:43.365 --> 00:14:46.539
I want to experience these
things, really I do.

00:14:46.639 --> 00:14:49.244
I just have to overcome
my fears, that's all.

00:14:49.344 --> 00:14:52.283
If it's fun for you,
it's important to me.

00:14:55.456 --> 00:14:58.395
[Yamato] Right. Are you
ready for another one?

00:15:03.774 --> 00:15:05.109
[Mei] Yeah.

00:15:37.942 --> 00:15:41.616
This chicken is delicious.
So are the churros.

00:15:41.716 --> 00:15:43.687
You look really happy.

00:15:44.522 --> 00:15:46.191
[Nagi] Big Brother!

00:15:47.595 --> 00:15:50.266
Nagi? And my brother Daichi?

00:15:50.366 --> 00:15:51.468
Your brother?

00:15:51.569 --> 00:15:52.671
What a coincidence!

00:15:52.771 --> 00:15:54.141
I didn't know you were here.

00:15:54.241 --> 00:15:56.746
Nagi was pretty insistent
about coming out here today,

00:15:56.846 --> 00:15:58.149
so here we are.

00:15:58.249 --> 00:15:58.817
Ouch!

00:15:58.917 --> 00:15:59.819
Nagi.

00:15:59.919 --> 00:16:01.689
Good afternoon, Nagi-san.

00:16:03.025 --> 00:16:04.896
[Nagi] Okay, Big Brother,
you can go now.

00:16:04.996 --> 00:16:06.498
What? Will you be all right by
yourse-

00:16:06.599 --> 00:16:09.471
[Nagi] I'll be fine. Big
Brother Yamato is here.

00:16:09.572 --> 00:16:10.574
So is Mei.

00:16:10.674 --> 00:16:12.043
[Both] Huh?

00:16:12.143 --> 00:16:14.047
Right? Is that okay, Mei?

00:16:14.147 --> 00:16:16.118
[Mei] Sure.
[Nagi] All right!

00:16:16.218 --> 00:16:17.588
[Yamato] What?
[Nagi] All right!

00:16:17.688 --> 00:16:19.859
What? Okay. I'm outta here.

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:21.529
You got this, brother?

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:22.531
Yeah.

00:16:22.631 --> 00:16:24.000
Sorry guys.

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:26.471
Uh, it's okay.

00:16:26.573 --> 00:16:28.075
[Daichi] See ya.

00:16:32.918 --> 00:16:34.555
[Yamato] She really likes you.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:35.924
[Nagi] I wanted to see Mei.

00:16:36.024 --> 00:16:38.162
[Yamato] Yeah, but...
[Nagi] I had to do it!

00:16:38.262 --> 00:16:41.836
'Cause you never invite
Mei-san over anymore!

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:44.575
Should we find some
more attractions?

00:16:44.675 --> 00:16:46.713
Whatever...

00:16:46.813 --> 00:16:50.854
[Nagi] Listen, there's something
I wanted to talk to you about.

00:16:50.954 --> 00:16:53.425
Starting this week,
I went back to school.

00:16:53.527 --> 00:16:55.496
How's it going?

00:16:55.597 --> 00:16:58.168
It's really fun.

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:00.607
Hey! Let's ride that!

00:17:01.074 --> 00:17:02.310
[Mei] What?

00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:04.549
You're not chicken, are you?

00:17:04.649 --> 00:17:05.851
I-I'm not a chicken.

00:17:05.951 --> 00:17:07.521
Then, let's go!

00:17:07.621 --> 00:17:08.757
Come on, Yamato!

00:17:10.594 --> 00:17:15.102
<i>[Mei] I never thought I'd</i>
<i>ever hear anyone say they</i>
<i>wanted to see me.</i>

00:17:15.203 --> 00:17:17.841
<i>That's so amazing to me!</i>

00:17:17.942 --> 00:17:19.010
[Momoko knocks at the door]

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:21.148
[Momoko] Megu? Megu, open up.

00:17:21.248 --> 00:17:22.383
[Megumi] Shut up!

00:17:22.483 --> 00:17:24.655
I bet you made fun of me, too!

00:17:24.755 --> 00:17:26.325
Pretending to be my friend...

00:17:26.425 --> 00:17:28.797
You were actually laughing
at me, weren't you?

00:17:28.897 --> 00:17:30.099
Megu...

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:31.536
Just leave...

00:17:33.305 --> 00:17:36.579
<i>[Mei] People are quick</i>
<i>to betray each other.</i>

00:17:38.315 --> 00:17:40.587
<i>That's what I used to think.</i>

00:17:41.723 --> 00:17:43.392
<i>But now...</i>

00:17:43.492 --> 00:17:46.833
<i>I have people who</i>
<i>like me for who I am.</i>

00:18:07.675 --> 00:18:09.411
[Megumi] Beautiful...

00:18:16.826 --> 00:18:19.130
Oh, come on. Jeez, Nagi.

00:18:19.230 --> 00:18:21.234
Do I look like a taxi to you?

00:18:21.869 --> 00:18:23.573
Now, now.

00:18:27.948 --> 00:18:29.785
This room looks pricy.

00:18:29.885 --> 00:18:32.290
Actually, this was
a cancellation.

00:18:32.390 --> 00:18:34.528
And I got the hotel
to give it to us.

00:18:41.208 --> 00:18:42.811
<i>[Mei] What am I</i>
<i>going to do, Mom?</i>

00:18:42.911 --> 00:18:45.751
<i>I came to a hotel on a date...</i>

00:18:45.851 --> 00:18:47.153
[Yamato] Mei.

00:18:47.253 --> 00:18:49.157
W-what is it?

00:18:49.257 --> 00:18:51.328
What are you doing?

00:18:52.063 --> 00:18:54.034
Did you have fun?

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:55.971
We were supposed to
spend the day together.

00:18:56.071 --> 00:18:58.677
I'm sorry for making
you take care of Nagi.

00:18:58.777 --> 00:19:00.146
But, she's asleep now...

00:19:00.246 --> 00:19:02.618
and we didn't get to
see the night parade...

00:19:04.454 --> 00:19:07.260
It's okay if we missed
out on some of it.

00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:09.030
I had more than enough fun.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:12.638
It's been a long time since
I've visited a place like this.

00:19:12.738 --> 00:19:16.713
Everything I saw felt like I was
seeing it for the first time.

00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:20.654
I'm pretty sure if I had
seen it before, I was
too young to remember.

00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:23.827
I think we did alright for
our first time out, huh?

00:19:42.731 --> 00:19:45.436
Thank you, Yamato.

00:19:47.941 --> 00:19:51.214
[Mei] But... Nagi-chan!
[Yamato] Don't worry.

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:53.285
She isn't going to
wake up till morning.

00:19:53.385 --> 00:19:55.022
<i>[Mei] What am I going to do?</i>

00:19:55.122 --> 00:19:55.991
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

00:19:56.091 --> 00:19:57.995
<i>What am I gonna DO?!</i>

00:19:58.095 --> 00:20:00.266
[Yamato] Your hair
has gotten long, Mei.

00:20:09.518 --> 00:20:13.025
Aw man, I really did
sweat a lot today.

00:20:13.125 --> 00:20:14.895
I sure hope you don't
think I'm stinky.

00:20:14.995 --> 00:20:17.500
What? You don't stink.

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:20.574
I-it's okay...

00:20:20.674 --> 00:20:21.843
Mei...

00:20:28.523 --> 00:20:31.696
Would you mind...
just staying like this?

00:20:37.708 --> 00:20:40.045
<i>[Yamato] Mei's taking</i>
<i>steps towards me.</i>

00:20:40.146 --> 00:20:42.016
<i>Even if it's little</i>
<i>by little...</i>

00:20:42.116 --> 00:20:43.853
<i>That's all I need...</i>

00:20:55.476 --> 00:20:57.514
[Mr. Tachibana] I'll protect
you.

00:21:11.475 --> 00:21:13.613
[Yamato] Hey. I see you're up.

00:21:14.147 --> 00:21:15.249
Good morning.

00:21:15.349 --> 00:21:16.819
Good morning.

00:21:16.919 --> 00:21:18.122
I fell asleep?

00:21:18.222 --> 00:21:20.760
Oh yeah, out like a light.

00:21:20.861 --> 00:21:21.929
Uh, sorry.

00:21:22.029 --> 00:21:24.267
Yeah, well, I didn't let
a little thing like that

00:21:24.367 --> 00:21:26.404
keep me from having
fun with you.

00:21:28.175 --> 00:21:29.845
What did you do!?

00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:31.114
[Yamato] Not telling.

00:21:31.214 --> 00:21:32.818
[Mei] Tell me!

00:21:38.095 --> 00:21:39.798
Let's take it slow.

00:21:45.242 --> 00:21:47.581
[Cellphone vibrates]

00:21:49.350 --> 00:21:52.123
[Yamato] Dessert?
What do they want?

00:21:52.223 --> 00:21:54.327
Hello?

00:21:54.427 --> 00:21:56.766
It's good to hear from you.

00:21:56.866 --> 00:21:58.168
Yes...

00:21:58.268 --> 00:22:00.406
What? Kitagawa?

00:22:01.241 --> 00:22:02.511
What's going on?

00:22:02.611 --> 00:22:04.849
They can't get in
touch with Kitagawa.

00:23:30.486 --> 00:23:32.958
[Mei] Life is like riding
a roller coaster.

00:23:33.058 --> 00:23:35.496
The landscape passes by
at incredible speeds,

00:23:35.597 --> 00:23:37.901
and my emotions continue
to change as well.

00:23:38.001 --> 00:23:40.139
[Marshmallow] Why are you
being so emotional, meow?

00:23:40.239 --> 00:23:41.509
I wish you'd feed me, meow.

00:23:41.609 --> 00:23:42.678
[Mei mumbles sleepily]

00:23:42.778 --> 00:23:44.715
[Marshmallow] Are
you asleep, meow?
