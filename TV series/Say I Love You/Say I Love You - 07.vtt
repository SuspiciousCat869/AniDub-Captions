00:00:11.957 --> 00:00:13.293
[Announcer] Attention
Platform 1.

00:00:13.393 --> 00:00:14.963
A train is passing through.

00:00:15.063 --> 00:00:17.602
Please stand behind
the yellow line.

00:00:18.203 --> 00:00:19.907
Ah! It's Yamato-kun!

00:00:20.007 --> 00:00:23.146
Wow, he's really in a magazine.

00:00:23.246 --> 00:00:25.083
[Girl 1] He made his
debut as a model.

00:00:25.183 --> 00:00:27.589
[Girl 2] It's kind
of lonely, isn't it?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.646
[Girl 1] Yamato-kun!
[Girl 2] We saw
you in "Dessert."

00:00:39.746 --> 00:00:41.282
Oh, thanks.

00:00:41.382 --> 00:00:43.721
Let us know when you're going to
be in the magazine again, okay?

00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.827
[Yamato] Well, it was
just this one time.
[Girl 1 &amp; 2] What?!

00:00:46.927 --> 00:00:49.866
That's gonna be such a waste
if you're not doing it anymore.

00:00:49.967 --> 00:00:51.870
[Yamato laughs] Thanks.

00:00:51.971 --> 00:00:53.975
Uh, good morning, Mei.

00:00:54.075 --> 00:00:56.145
Uh, good morning.

00:00:57.414 --> 00:01:00.220
<i>[Mei] They seemed</i>
<i>like a real couple.</i>

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.661
<i>They were so attractive.</i>
<i>So radiant.</i>

00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:07.368
<i>She's probably the one who</i>
<i>belongs at Yamato's side...</i>

00:02:41.222 --> 00:02:45.197
[Asami] Look, look!
[Nakanishi] That's amazing!
You're really in here!

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:47.468
[Asami] Megu-tan looks
so good in gingham.

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.608
[Nakanishi] Yamato, you were
like a different person then.

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:52.812
[Yamato] Enough already.
It's embarrassing...

00:02:52.912 --> 00:02:56.285
What? But you were so
handsome, right, Mei-chan?

00:02:56.386 --> 00:02:58.256
[Mei] Huh?
[Asami] Right?

00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:00.327
Yeah. You really were handsome.

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.901
Really? You really
thought I was handsome?

00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:07.408
Wow... You're persistent.

00:03:08.978 --> 00:03:12.819
[Aiko] Amazing.
[Mei] Aiko-san.

00:03:12.919 --> 00:03:16.593
Yamato's finally made
his appearance in a
national publication.

00:03:16.693 --> 00:03:19.432
That's going to give
you a lot to deal with.

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:25.878
Hey, Megu.

00:03:27.247 --> 00:03:29.485
Mei, are you working
after school today?

00:03:29.586 --> 00:03:30.353
[Mei] No.

00:03:30.454 --> 00:03:31.990
Then, let's go home together.

00:03:32.091 --> 00:03:34.128
I'll meet you after class.

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:35.565
Sure.

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:46.052
[Aiko] Yamato.
[Yamato] Huh? What?

00:03:46.152 --> 00:03:49.993
You're in that much of
a rush to get out of here
and see Tachibana.

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:51.062
Thanks for the notes.

00:03:51.162 --> 00:03:52.732
[Yamato] Any problems?

00:03:52.832 --> 00:03:54.168
It was all good.

00:03:54.268 --> 00:03:56.139
[Megumi] Yamato-kun.
[Yamato &amp; Aiko] Hm?

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:58.309
Uh, got a minute?

00:03:59.378 --> 00:04:01.717
[Yamato &amp; Aiko] They want what?!

00:04:01.817 --> 00:04:03.721
[Megumi] Since the magazine
went on sale, they've been

00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:06.827
receiving tons of inquiries
about Yamato-kun!

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:09.866
The editor wants you back
for more photoshoots.

00:04:09.966 --> 00:04:11.503
Yamato, that's awesome!

00:04:11.603 --> 00:04:13.574
You're gonna be a model, dude!

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.143
No, I'm not.

00:04:15.243 --> 00:04:17.615
[Megumi] Please. The
pay is really awesome,

00:04:17.715 --> 00:04:20.487
and you can quit any
time you want, I promise.

00:04:22.324 --> 00:04:24.161
What do you think
I should do, Mei?

00:04:24.261 --> 00:04:29.205
Uh... Uh, I think...

00:04:29.305 --> 00:04:31.175
it'd be really good for you.

00:04:31.275 --> 00:04:34.883
An opportunity like this isn't
going to come around that often.

00:04:34.983 --> 00:04:38.323
It's amazing that they're
asking you to do the
work in the first place.

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:40.695
[Nakanishi] I know, right?
[Asami] Do it. Do it!

00:04:40.795 --> 00:04:44.536
I'm sure you'll be a big
success, Yamato-kun!

00:04:44.636 --> 00:04:47.575
I suppose a couple more
shoots wouldn't hurt.

00:04:47.675 --> 00:04:50.046
[Asami] Yeah! Go Yamato!
[Nakanishi] Yeah!

00:04:50.147 --> 00:04:52.819
[Nakanishi] Say, do you think
we could get some work, too?

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:54.255
Something lovey-dovey?

00:04:54.355 --> 00:04:56.660
[Asami] I'd love that!

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.296
[Asami] All the
pictures are so cute.

00:04:58.396 --> 00:04:59.966
Especially the ones where
you're squeezing Yamato.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.304
[Megumi] What?! Uh, that's
kind of embarrassing.

00:05:02.404 --> 00:05:04.441
[Yamato] Are the photo shoots
always after school?

00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:07.481
[Megumi] No. Sometimes they're
in the morning or on Saturday.

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.120
Man. A model's life is hard.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.224
I know! Let's get
some hang time in!

00:05:12.324 --> 00:05:15.698
[Yamato] That's kind of sudden.
[Nakanishi] Well, you're going
to be busy all the time.

00:05:15.798 --> 00:05:17.936
We're not going to be able to
hang out as much as we use to.

00:05:18.036 --> 00:05:21.075
[Yamato] Yeah, whatever man.
[Nakanishi] I want to hang
out with Megu-tan, okay?

00:05:21.175 --> 00:05:22.477
[Asami] Takeshi!

00:05:22.579 --> 00:05:24.248
You guys up for karaoke?

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:26.152
[Nakanishi] Yeah, let's go!

00:05:26.252 --> 00:05:28.891
Wait. Mei-chan doesn't
like karaoke.

00:05:28.991 --> 00:05:30.528
Oh, right. Then...

00:05:30.628 --> 00:05:32.866
Uh, I'm headed home
anyway, but thank you.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:36.305
[Asami] What?
[Yamato] You said you didn't
have work today, Mei.

00:05:36.405 --> 00:05:39.078
I can't. I'm sorry.

00:05:54.509 --> 00:05:56.445
[Asami] We had so
much fun yesterday.

00:05:56.547 --> 00:05:59.118
Megu-tan's got a really
great singing voice.

00:05:59.819 --> 00:06:00.955
Really?

00:06:11.242 --> 00:06:12.645
You got it now?

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:16.385
Yamato-kun?

00:06:16.485 --> 00:06:19.826
[Yamato] Uh, during the photo
shoot... Wh-what was it?

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:23.667
Don't go straining your brain
trying to invent something
for yourself to do.

00:06:23.767 --> 00:06:25.671
Just relax and have fun with it.

00:06:25.771 --> 00:06:27.976
[Yamato] That's the
hard part for me.

00:06:28.076 --> 00:06:29.913
[Girl 1] Oh, Megu-tan!

00:06:30.013 --> 00:06:31.650
Please shake my hand!

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.421
What? You want a handshake
from someone like me?

00:06:34.522 --> 00:06:36.325
Yeah, of course we do!

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:37.494
I-I'm so honored!

00:06:37.595 --> 00:06:39.331
[Girl 1] Keep up the good work!

00:06:39.431 --> 00:06:40.601
[Girl 2] We're rooting for you!

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:42.906
[Megumi giggles] Thanks.

00:06:46.412 --> 00:06:48.951
[Yamato] You handled that
really well, Kitagawa.

00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:53.293
Sure. I never thought people
would like me just for my
magazine modeling.

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:55.163
I'm really grateful for it.

00:06:56.232 --> 00:06:58.369
You're really nice,
you know that?

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:00.307
You think so, huh?

00:07:00.407 --> 00:07:04.716
Okay, tell me the five
rules for a photo shoot.
You just learned them.

00:07:04.816 --> 00:07:08.423
Huh? Uh... W-well... Uh...

00:07:08.524 --> 00:07:11.930
The first one is,
uh... What was it?

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.942
[Yamato] Mei, let's
eat lunch together.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.617
[Mei] Sure.

00:07:21.717 --> 00:07:24.021
Okay, let me just
call Asami-san.

00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:25.825
[Yamato] Just us.

00:07:25.925 --> 00:07:29.264
[Girl 1] Yamato, you're going to
keep working as a model, right?

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:30.701
[Girl 2] I look forward to it.

00:07:30.801 --> 00:07:31.937
Thanks.

00:07:33.607 --> 00:07:35.043
Should we go outside?

00:07:44.161 --> 00:07:46.132
[Mei] Are you sure about this?

00:07:46.232 --> 00:07:50.040
Oh yeah. We haven't had time
to ourselves in a while.

00:07:54.448 --> 00:07:57.154
Hey, looks the same
as always, Mei.

00:07:57.254 --> 00:07:59.158
There's some fruit
in there today.

00:08:01.563 --> 00:08:02.565
[Yamato] What is that?

00:08:02.665 --> 00:08:04.602
Huh? I-it's nothing...

00:08:04.703 --> 00:08:06.238
[Yamato chuckles] Show me.

00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:15.490
[Yamato] Uh, sorry.

00:08:21.903 --> 00:08:25.310
Cookies? Did you
make these for me?

00:08:25.410 --> 00:08:28.182
Nagi-san is teaching me to cook.

00:08:28.282 --> 00:08:29.686
But it's still a
work in progress.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.925
They have no taste, and they
may potentially kill you.

00:08:33.026 --> 00:08:35.965
[Yamato] Cookie time!
[Mei] Don't!

00:08:41.142 --> 00:08:42.578
[Yamato] You're not dying.

00:08:43.614 --> 00:08:45.216
Make them again some time.

00:08:45.316 --> 00:08:47.555
You really might die next time.

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:48.991
[Yamato] I'll risk it.

00:08:49.726 --> 00:08:51.530
If I feel like it.

00:08:56.940 --> 00:08:59.913
The chime's ringing.
Let's go back.

00:09:00.013 --> 00:09:01.148
Okay.

00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.268
[Asami] Oh, wow!

00:09:11.368 --> 00:09:14.341
[Nakanishi] Asamicchi,
try making this pose.
[Asami] Like this?

00:09:14.441 --> 00:09:15.644
[Nakanishi] You're my angel.

00:09:15.745 --> 00:09:17.047
Good luck at your shoot!

00:09:17.147 --> 00:09:18.449
Good luck you guys!

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:20.554
See you later!

00:09:20.654 --> 00:09:22.257
Let's go, Yamato-kun.

00:09:29.806 --> 00:09:32.545
Mei! I'll text you!

00:09:37.822 --> 00:09:39.024
[Nakanishi] Keep it together!

00:09:39.124 --> 00:09:41.028
[Asami] Smile pretty!

00:09:51.182 --> 00:09:55.023
I'm sorry. You haven't gone
home together recently.

00:09:55.123 --> 00:09:56.425
Hm?

00:09:56.526 --> 00:09:57.895
With Mei-chan.

00:09:57.995 --> 00:10:00.467
You don't need to apologize
for that, Kitagawa.

00:10:00.568 --> 00:10:01.570
Really?

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.206
Yeah.

00:10:21.342 --> 00:10:24.616
May they come out close
to edible this time.

00:10:36.372 --> 00:10:38.342
[Assistant] Good work, everyone!

00:10:38.442 --> 00:10:40.681
The chief editor
complimented you.

00:10:40.781 --> 00:10:42.250
[Yamato] It's all thanks to you.

00:10:48.229 --> 00:10:50.166
Hmm? Is it a boy?

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:52.103
MOM! Get out!

00:10:52.204 --> 00:10:54.609
[Megumi] Yamato, are you
going straight home?

00:10:54.709 --> 00:10:57.682
[Yamato] Well, I am hungry.

00:10:57.782 --> 00:10:59.819
[Megumi] Do you like curry?
[Yamato] Huh?

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:02.157
Yesterday, I accidentally
made too much.

00:11:02.257 --> 00:11:05.196
Ten servings, even though
I live by myself.

00:11:05.296 --> 00:11:09.037
And since I won't eat it all,
would you join me for dinner?

00:11:09.137 --> 00:11:10.273
Uh...

00:11:24.067 --> 00:11:26.372
I'm really glad you
said yes, Yamato-kun.

00:11:26.472 --> 00:11:29.846
I've been eating nothing
but curry since yesterday.

00:11:32.718 --> 00:11:34.288
This is it.

00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.462
Have a seat.

00:11:38.564 --> 00:11:39.899
[Yamato] Okay.

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:42.204
[Megumi] I bet you
think it's messy.

00:11:42.304 --> 00:11:43.740
[Yamato] No...

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.711
I'm kind of surprised, actually.

00:11:45.811 --> 00:11:48.216
[Megumi] Right? As in messy.

00:11:48.316 --> 00:11:51.990
It's a little run down,
but there are nice things
about living here.

00:11:52.592 --> 00:11:54.562
The view at dusk...

00:11:54.662 --> 00:11:56.165
I usually come home after dark,

00:11:56.265 --> 00:11:59.104
so I don't get to
see it very often.

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:03.045
[Yamato] Thanks for the food.

00:12:05.818 --> 00:12:07.120
Oh, wow!

00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.122
Glad you like it.

00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:10.694
I even have curry
potato salad, here.

00:12:10.794 --> 00:12:12.698
You made all these dishes?

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:16.907
You can even make croquettes
with leftover curry potato
salad, it's not hard.

00:12:17.407 --> 00:12:18.610
Wow.

00:12:18.710 --> 00:12:21.015
Thanks for the food.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:24.856
Is there's something missing
from your plate, Kitagawa?

00:12:24.956 --> 00:12:27.494
[Megumi] My grandmother
has her own little farm.

00:12:27.595 --> 00:12:30.066
Eating cabbage saves
me money on rice.

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:34.542
And besides, a big ol'
serving of cabbage has
fewer calories than rice.

00:12:34.642 --> 00:12:36.211
And curry cabbage
is pretty good.

00:12:36.312 --> 00:12:38.349
A girl like you needs
to watch her weight?

00:12:38.449 --> 00:12:41.690
[Megumi] Well, it's my job
to have people look at me.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.061
Sure, I'm an amateur
model right now,

00:12:44.161 --> 00:12:47.500
but one day I'm going to be
on the runway with real models.

00:12:47.602 --> 00:12:52.277
Leaving home and living
on my own while attending
high school is really scary.

00:12:52.377 --> 00:12:56.318
But I thought it would
be better to be on my
own sooner than later.

00:12:56.418 --> 00:12:57.688
Um, you want seconds?

00:12:57.788 --> 00:12:59.692
Yeah, sure.

00:12:59.792 --> 00:13:01.128
Okay.

00:13:02.464 --> 00:13:05.403
Instead of eating out,
I've been saving my money.

00:13:05.504 --> 00:13:08.610
I figured making my own meals
would help me cook for anyone.

00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.783
And help me develop a little
self-discipline in the process.

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:13.219
[Yamato] That's amazing.

00:13:13.319 --> 00:13:15.089
[Megumi] Nothing
amazing about it.

00:13:15.189 --> 00:13:16.960
My mom worked nights,
so I've been fending

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.066
for myself and learning new
life skills since I was little.

00:13:22.003 --> 00:13:26.780
It's been a long time since
I made a meal and had someone
else to share it with.

00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:28.416
Thank you, Yamato-kun.

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.353
Huh? No, really.

00:13:30.453 --> 00:13:33.960
I should be thanking you
for having me over, Kitagawa.

00:13:34.061 --> 00:13:37.968
Uh, um... Maybe from
now on, after work...

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:40.541
We could kind of make
this a regular thing?

00:13:40.641 --> 00:13:42.511
If you want.

00:13:48.590 --> 00:13:50.026
If you don't mind.

00:14:24.796 --> 00:14:25.798
[Yamato] Sorry.

00:14:25.898 --> 00:14:27.233
Okay.

00:14:44.535 --> 00:14:47.407
Yamato's been spending
all his time with Megu-tan.

00:14:47.508 --> 00:14:51.081
They're both modeling for
the same agency, Asami-san.

00:15:02.103 --> 00:15:04.575
They got them in the
same photoshoot again?

00:15:53.172 --> 00:15:56.278
[Nakanishi] I'm bored.
[Asami] Why's that?

00:15:56.378 --> 00:15:59.284
Yamato's been acting really
aloof lately, yanno?

00:15:59.384 --> 00:16:03.192
I guess even models get
really busy, don't they?

00:16:07.768 --> 00:16:09.070
Mei-chan?

00:16:16.953 --> 00:16:18.322
Okay.

00:16:18.422 --> 00:16:20.828
I wonder what's wrong with her?

00:16:20.928 --> 00:16:22.197
Ladies room?

00:16:22.297 --> 00:16:23.432
Huh?

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:28.375
[Girl 1] Yamato-kun did?

00:16:28.475 --> 00:16:31.014
Isn't he supposed to be
going out with Tachibana?

00:16:31.114 --> 00:16:34.555
I heard one of the girls
saw him coming out of
Megu-tan's apartment.

00:16:34.655 --> 00:16:36.491
[Girl 1] What?!

00:16:36.593 --> 00:16:39.699
[Girl 2] Actually, that
makes more sense when
you think about it.

00:16:39.799 --> 00:16:41.368
[Girl 1] I guess.

00:16:42.505 --> 00:16:43.640
Crap.

00:16:50.587 --> 00:16:55.162
[Mei's heart beat
gradually quickens]

00:17:02.978 --> 00:17:04.615
[Asami] There you are!

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:06.351
Mei-chan!

00:17:06.451 --> 00:17:09.291
Aiko-chan gave me coupons
for this new dessert buffet

00:17:09.391 --> 00:17:11.428
in Shibuya that has
all-you-can-eat cake!

00:17:11.529 --> 00:17:13.600
She said they have
over 30 varieties!

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.106
They even have pizza. So on the
way home, I thought we could...

00:17:17.207 --> 00:17:20.313
Uh... Mei-chan?

00:17:24.087 --> 00:17:27.193
Hey, Mei-chan,
what's the matter?

00:17:33.172 --> 00:17:38.015
[Aiko] Wow. Even the ice
queen cries once in a while.
[Asami] Aiko-chan!

00:17:38.115 --> 00:17:42.156
[Mei] It's nothing.
[Asami] If it were nothing,
you wouldn't be crying.

00:17:42.257 --> 00:17:44.662
What's going on?

00:17:44.762 --> 00:17:46.966
[Mei] It's nothing...

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:48.770
Mei-chan...

00:17:48.870 --> 00:17:50.774
[Mei] It's nothing.

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:51.976
Really.

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:55.182
[Asami] Mei-chan...
You can tell me.

00:17:56.819 --> 00:17:58.355
Stop telling her it's nothing.

00:17:58.455 --> 00:18:00.961
We both know why you're
in this hallway.

00:18:01.061 --> 00:18:04.334
So don't try telling
us it's nothing. Idiot!

00:18:04.434 --> 00:18:06.204
Can't you see she's
worried about you?!

00:18:06.305 --> 00:18:07.942
Stop it, Aiko-chan!

00:18:08.042 --> 00:18:09.344
[Aiko] If you're
going to be like that,

00:18:09.444 --> 00:18:11.114
don't bother anyone else!

00:18:11.214 --> 00:18:13.352
[Asami] I said stop it!

00:18:13.452 --> 00:18:15.724
Oh god, I'm sorry, Aiko-chan.

00:18:15.824 --> 00:18:18.362
Mei-chan, I'm sorry, I...

00:18:18.462 --> 00:18:22.003
I knew... I knew then...

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:25.076
And at the studio.

00:18:25.176 --> 00:18:29.885
I was so busy acting dumb
and starstruck and...

00:18:29.986 --> 00:18:33.660
And now, you're
crying by yourself.

00:18:33.760 --> 00:18:37.935
It must have been hard
watching them act like
boyfriend and girlfriend.

00:18:38.035 --> 00:18:42.745
I want to help you,
Mei-chan. You can tell
me anything you want.

00:18:42.845 --> 00:18:46.151
Just like you helped me,
I want to help you.

00:18:57.641 --> 00:19:03.953
<i>[Mei] I was frustrated. I</i>
<i>cried, and it was embarrassing,</i>

00:19:04.054 --> 00:19:06.258
<i>but I ended up telling them.</i>

00:19:06.358 --> 00:19:10.867
<i>Every single one of</i>
<i>my stupid feelings.</i>

00:19:10.967 --> 00:19:13.707
<i>Everything.</i>

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:16.478
I didn't know he'd gone to
Megumi-san's apartment until

00:19:16.579 --> 00:19:20.219
I overheard two girls in the
hallway talking about it.

00:19:21.589 --> 00:19:25.329
I don't get it, guys. Doesn't
Kurosawa understand how bad

00:19:25.429 --> 00:19:28.035
something like this
would make him look?

00:19:28.135 --> 00:19:31.108
I want to trust him completely,

00:19:31.208 --> 00:19:34.414
but he's just not
letting me do it.

00:19:34.515 --> 00:19:38.590
[Asami sighs] That's an emotion
unique to girls, I guess.

00:19:38.690 --> 00:19:40.827
[Mei] You've felt it, too?
[Asami] Oh yeah.

00:19:40.927 --> 00:19:43.867
[Asami] Even when Takeshi
just talks to other girls...

00:19:43.967 --> 00:19:46.572
I just get crazy
thinking about it.

00:19:46.672 --> 00:19:49.945
It's like I get sucked into a
whirlpool of negative energy.

00:19:52.417 --> 00:19:55.724
[Aiko] In my case, I wasn't
just imagining things.

00:19:55.824 --> 00:19:57.895
I'm the crowned princess
of being cheated on.

00:19:57.995 --> 00:19:59.532
[Asami] Aiko-chan...

00:19:59.632 --> 00:20:01.969
There's nothing wrong with
keeping a watchful eye on

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.640
your boyfriend and
some other girl.

00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.548
It's like a wall you
need to climb over to
get to the next level.

00:20:07.648 --> 00:20:09.350
Even if you're running
up against that wall,

00:20:09.451 --> 00:20:13.960
it still means you two
are moving forward.

00:20:14.060 --> 00:20:19.505
I can't tell you how many times
I've walked away from that wall
instead of climbing over it.

00:20:19.605 --> 00:20:23.847
If you don't take the initiative
with him you're gonna get stuck.

00:20:23.947 --> 00:20:25.784
Is any of this sinking in?

00:20:27.453 --> 00:20:30.527
You like Yamato, don't you?

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:46.726
It isn't positive or negative.

00:20:46.826 --> 00:20:50.934
It's neither good nor evil.
It just is what it is.

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:53.305
Just show him how you feel.

00:20:55.376 --> 00:20:56.879
<i>[Mei] I...</i>

00:21:06.933 --> 00:21:08.268
<i>I...</i>

00:21:11.709 --> 00:21:13.378
<i>I really...</i>

00:21:19.892 --> 00:21:21.027
Mei.

00:21:22.263 --> 00:21:23.967
<i>[Mei] I Really...</i>

00:21:55.462 --> 00:21:57.300
Do you still remember me...

00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.736
Yamato?

00:23:30.620 --> 00:23:34.060
I can't believe it! Before I
knew it, I was kissing him!

00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.298
[Marshmellow] It's still only
lukewarm. If you don't tell him

00:23:36.398 --> 00:23:38.135
your feelings, he'll
never know, meow.

00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:40.807
Wh-what am I supposed to do now?

00:23:40.907 --> 00:23:43.078
[Marshmellow] Listen
to your cat, meow!
