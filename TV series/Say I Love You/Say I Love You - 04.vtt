WEBVTT

00:00:04.977 --> 00:00:07.314
[Mei] Thanks for letting
me borrow this.

00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:09.452
I put it in with our laundry.

00:00:12.057 --> 00:00:14.796
Thanks. I've got something
for you, too.

00:00:14.897 --> 00:00:16.065
For me?

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.403
Yeah, hold out your hand.

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:19.540
[Mei] What for?

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:20.775
[Yamato] Just do it.

00:00:30.562 --> 00:00:33.801
<i>Why would he choose</i>
<i>you over someone who's</i>
<i>already had sex with him?</i>

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:37.776
[Yamato] All done.

00:00:39.947 --> 00:00:41.584
It's a gift.

00:00:41.684 --> 00:00:43.286
A symbol of our love.

00:00:48.731 --> 00:00:50.501
Thanks, Kurosawa-kun...

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:53.173
[Yamato] You're welcome.

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:32.605
[Girl 1] You know Mei Tachibana?
That girl from class C?

00:02:32.706 --> 00:02:35.812
[Girl 2] Oh, that weird
girl? The one who doesn't
talk to anyone?

00:02:35.912 --> 00:02:40.220
[Girl 1] Right, her.
Have you noticed that
she's changed recently?

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.990
[Boy] Yeah, she's
gotten cuter.

00:02:42.091 --> 00:02:44.128
[Girl 2] What?
[Boy] No, I'm serious.

00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:46.800
The other day, I saw her
smile for the first time!

00:02:50.708 --> 00:02:54.950
Yeah, but get this. I heard
she was going out with Kurosawa.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.152
[Boy &amp; Girl 2] What?

00:02:56.252 --> 00:02:57.822
[Boy] You're kidding!
[Girl 2] Really?

00:03:03.968 --> 00:03:06.640
[Nakanishi] Then Asamicchi
said, "That's not okay."

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:10.047
Isn't that the cutest?
She's so cute!

00:03:10.147 --> 00:03:11.517
Yeah, sure is.

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:13.621
[Hayakawa] Yamato!
[Both] Huh?

00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:15.057
Hayakawa.

00:03:15.157 --> 00:03:16.827
Hey, how've you been, dude?

00:03:16.927 --> 00:03:19.599
[Yamato] Oh, all right.
[Hayakawa] Okay, so tell me.

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:21.937
I hear you're dating
a girl named Tachibana.

00:03:22.037 --> 00:03:26.079
It's rare for you to get
close to one particular
girl, isn't it?

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.249
We should go eat sometime.

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.753
Where's all this coming from?

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:30.655
[Hayakawa] What do you mean?

00:03:30.755 --> 00:03:32.357
We're friends, right?

00:03:32.458 --> 00:03:35.631
I just wanna meet her. Come on.

00:03:35.732 --> 00:03:37.869
[Miyuki] Hayakawa!

00:03:37.969 --> 00:03:40.942
Do you have some free time this
week? Let's go out, okay?

00:03:41.042 --> 00:03:42.912
Yeah, you got it, sweetheart.

00:03:43.012 --> 00:03:45.283
[Miyuki] All right! I've
been so depressed lately.

00:03:45.383 --> 00:03:49.058
I can't have any fun without
you! You know that.

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:50.093
I'll call you.

00:03:50.193 --> 00:03:51.295
Awesome!

00:03:51.395 --> 00:03:53.934
So long! See ya around!

00:03:54.034 --> 00:03:55.905
She said fun...

00:03:57.942 --> 00:03:59.546
That kind of fun?

00:03:59.646 --> 00:04:01.349
Only if we're both up for it.

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:03.654
If you understand my meaning.

00:04:03.754 --> 00:04:04.723
Anyway, Yamato...

00:04:04.823 --> 00:04:06.794
Yeah, I'll ask Mei if
she wants to do it.

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:08.864
Cool, it's a deal.

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:12.839
[Mei] Excuse me.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.275
[Sensei] Hey, Tachibana!

00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:19.853
[Yamato] Mei!

00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:21.990
What have you got there?

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.961
And why are you
in such a hurry?

00:04:24.061 --> 00:04:27.434
I'm carrying the world
map we're using in my next
class, Kurosawa-kun.

00:04:27.535 --> 00:04:30.474
Okay, and what are you
breathing so heavy for?

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:31.944
When I went to get the map,

00:04:32.044 --> 00:04:36.018
a teacher saw my bracelet
and tried to confiscate it.

00:04:36.119 --> 00:04:37.755
So I hit him with this and ran.

00:04:38.423 --> 00:04:39.759
That's aggressive.

00:04:40.728 --> 00:04:44.603
[Mei] I'm glad...
he didn't take it.

00:04:47.609 --> 00:04:50.548
Is it that important?
To you, I mean.

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:53.921
[Mei] Of course it is.

00:05:03.273 --> 00:05:06.547
[Yamato] You... are
so doggone cute.

00:05:08.483 --> 00:05:09.753
[Mei slaps Yamato]

00:05:09.853 --> 00:05:13.393
[Mei] Don't be so "doggone"
creepy about it!

00:05:13.493 --> 00:05:15.798
[Yamato] Hey, wa-wait!

00:05:15.898 --> 00:05:19.639
My friend Hayakawa wants to meet
you. If that's alright with you.

00:05:19.739 --> 00:05:20.675
Hayakawa?

00:05:20.775 --> 00:05:22.679
He suggested we all
go out for dinner.

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:23.514
What for?

00:05:23.614 --> 00:05:24.783
He wanted to see for himself.

00:05:24.883 --> 00:05:25.518
To see what?

00:05:25.618 --> 00:05:26.687
Well, uh, my girlfriend.

00:05:26.787 --> 00:05:28.557
[Mei] What?!
[Yamato] Not to mention,

00:05:28.657 --> 00:05:32.097
your popularity here's been
completely skyrocketing!

00:05:33.132 --> 00:05:35.237
Anyway, he's a fun guy.

00:05:35.337 --> 00:05:37.007
But only if you want to.

00:05:37.107 --> 00:05:41.382
It might be cool if you
made another friend or
two through me, right?

00:05:44.856 --> 00:05:45.992
[Mei] Yeah...

00:05:47.996 --> 00:05:50.635
Huh, I see.

00:05:50.735 --> 00:05:55.110
Yup. For now, it's the three of
us going out to dinner sometime.

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.387
You should come. You
like him, don't you?

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:01.657
[Aiko] I don't think so.

00:06:01.757 --> 00:06:04.128
What are you trying
to pull anyway?

00:06:04.228 --> 00:06:05.565
What do you mean?

00:06:05.665 --> 00:06:09.104
I guess I'm curious, and
I want to congratulate him.

00:06:10.975 --> 00:06:12.077
Lyin' bastard.

00:06:12.177 --> 00:06:13.346
Get over yourself.

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:15.016
You can never have
too many friends.

00:06:15.116 --> 00:06:16.620
You know what I mean?

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.626
Yeah, I know what kind of
friends you're talking about.

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:24.134
[Aiko] Yamato!

00:06:25.671 --> 00:06:28.142
I can't take it anymore!
I want to die!

00:06:28.243 --> 00:06:30.681
I'll never be as cute as
other girls! I look stupid!

00:06:30.781 --> 00:06:32.117
[Yamato] How can you say that?

00:06:32.217 --> 00:06:33.954
It's true!

00:06:34.054 --> 00:06:37.094
All those changes you made for
that guy you were in love with

00:06:37.194 --> 00:06:38.897
still can be good for you.

00:06:38.998 --> 00:06:44.074
Aiko, you're more pure,
feminine, and attractive
than anyone I know.

00:06:45.143 --> 00:06:47.147
Really? Then prove it to me now!

00:06:47.247 --> 00:06:49.552
Sleep with me!

00:06:49.653 --> 00:06:52.926
Will that... really
make you feel better?

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:00.073
[Aiko] It will.

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:05.718
<i>[Aiko] I couldn't accept</i>
<i>what happened that day.</i>

00:07:05.818 --> 00:07:08.323
<i>I didn't want to stay dirty.</i>

00:07:08.423 --> 00:07:10.861
<i>That's why I...</i>

00:07:10.962 --> 00:07:16.105
<i>But the moment I decided</i>
<i>to seriously pursue</i>
<i>Yamato, what do I get?</i>

00:07:16.205 --> 00:07:19.278
Okay Tachibana, do you like
Yamato, or don't you?

00:07:19.378 --> 00:07:20.581
I guess...

00:07:20.681 --> 00:07:24.188
<i>Why you? I won't</i>
<i>let you have him!</i>

00:07:26.660 --> 00:07:29.465
[Miyuki] So why is it that
you're just as popular as Yamato

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:32.905
when you're both so
different, Hayakawa?

00:07:33.006 --> 00:07:35.243
[Hayakawa] What?

00:07:35.343 --> 00:07:38.617
I mean, you'll date pretty much
anyone who comes your way,

00:07:38.717 --> 00:07:41.222
but Yamato's isn't
like that at all.

00:07:43.226 --> 00:07:46.298
I heard Yamato has all the
groupies a guy could ask for,

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:49.639
but he hasn't slept
with any of them.

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:52.512
I heard he's going out with
Mei Tachibana at the moment.

00:07:52.612 --> 00:07:54.448
[Miyuki] Okay, now
that's just silly.

00:07:54.549 --> 00:07:58.891
I mean, Yamato's so cool
that it seems like he could
date anybody, yanno?

00:07:58.991 --> 00:08:01.329
I'm kind of jealous.

00:08:01.429 --> 00:08:05.738
Of course I'd rather be with the
kind of guy who'll always help
me get rid of my frustrations.

00:08:07.842 --> 00:08:10.246
A girl like you would
probably intimidate him.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.054
It's nice of you to
say, but seriously-
[Miyuki's cellphone rings]

00:08:14.154 --> 00:08:17.327
[Hayakawa] It's just
funny that Tachibana's
the one he chose, yanno?

00:08:17.427 --> 00:08:19.431
Crap, it's my
boyfriend calling me.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:21.135
What the hell does
he want anyway?

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.441
Hello?

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:26.780
You're the one who said
you wouldn't call anymore.

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.251
What? N-now?

00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:31.255
Sure, I guess. Where?

00:08:31.355 --> 00:08:33.894
Yeah. I-I'll be right there.

00:08:44.181 --> 00:08:45.183
[Hayakawa] Yamato!

00:08:45.283 --> 00:08:46.285
What'd she say?

00:08:46.385 --> 00:08:47.522
What?

00:08:47.622 --> 00:08:49.358
I'm talking about your
girlfriend, dude.

00:08:49.458 --> 00:08:50.460
What'd she say?

00:08:50.561 --> 00:08:52.097
[Yamato] Oh right, sorry.

00:08:52.197 --> 00:08:53.433
I meant to talk to you.

00:08:53.534 --> 00:08:55.003
Mei's only free on Saturday.

00:08:55.103 --> 00:08:56.640
That's fine. This week?

00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:58.109
[Yamato] Next week
would work, too.

00:08:58.209 --> 00:08:59.211
[Hayakawa] Let's do this week.

00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.915
I'll rearrange my schedule.

00:09:01.015 --> 00:09:01.883
[Yamato] You sure?

00:09:01.983 --> 00:09:03.587
[Hayakawa] Yeah, I'll just tell

00:09:03.687 --> 00:09:04.756
her that we're going to
go out some other time.

00:09:04.856 --> 00:09:06.225
[Yamato] Huh? You
had other plans?

00:09:06.325 --> 00:09:08.362
[Yamato] Are you sure?
[Hayakawa] Of course I'm sure.

00:09:08.463 --> 00:09:11.235
You're not afraid of having
me meet up with her, are ya?

00:09:11.335 --> 00:09:13.072
I'm not gonna bite her, dude.

00:09:13.774 --> 00:09:15.243
We'll be there. Okay.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.416
See you Saturday, then.

00:09:18.517 --> 00:09:19.719
Yeah.

00:09:30.875 --> 00:09:32.879
[Hayakawa] Come on, eat up!

00:09:34.314 --> 00:09:35.751
It's on me today, okay?

00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:38.322
[Mei] W-we can split-
[Hayakawa] It's fine.

00:09:38.423 --> 00:09:43.199
I'm just happy I get
to spend some time out
with you guys today.

00:09:43.299 --> 00:09:44.736
I'll pay for mine.

00:09:44.836 --> 00:09:48.009
Really? Then I'll
get Tachibana-san's
share of the bill.

00:09:48.109 --> 00:09:50.380
You guys always split the
bill when you go out?

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.451
You can't do that on
a real date, dude.

00:09:52.552 --> 00:09:55.891
You gotta man up and pay both
halves of the bill, Kurosawa.

00:09:55.991 --> 00:09:58.229
Isn't that right, Tachibana-san?

00:10:01.235 --> 00:10:04.742
Tachibana-san, are you always
this quiet and reserved?

00:10:04.843 --> 00:10:06.913
Word around school is
you've changed a lot.

00:10:07.013 --> 00:10:09.384
Not that I've seen. She's
always been this way.

00:10:09.485 --> 00:10:10.386
Isn't that right

00:10:10.487 --> 00:10:11.923
Knock that off!

00:10:12.023 --> 00:10:12.992
Heh, see?

00:10:13.092 --> 00:10:15.263
She's skinny, but
she eats a lot.

00:10:16.365 --> 00:10:17.702
Yeah, I see.

00:10:19.004 --> 00:10:21.776
She's nervous about meeting
someone for the first time,

00:10:21.877 --> 00:10:24.248
so she's eating more
than she usually does.

00:10:24.348 --> 00:10:26.118
Mmhmm.

00:10:26.218 --> 00:10:28.590
[Yamato] At first, she wouldn't
tell me about things like that.

00:10:28.690 --> 00:10:30.961
She wouldn't even look
at me when we talked.

00:10:31.061 --> 00:10:34.301
So in that respect, I
guess she has changed.

00:10:34.401 --> 00:10:38.577
Now she even talks to
Nakanishi and Asami
like it's nothing.

00:10:38.677 --> 00:10:41.683
So this is another step forward.

00:10:41.783 --> 00:10:45.624
Keep going like this Mei,
and you're gonna make
a bunch of new friends.

00:10:45.724 --> 00:10:47.562
[Hayakawa] Friends! Exactly!

00:10:47.662 --> 00:10:49.398
I can be a good
friend if you let me.

00:10:49.498 --> 00:10:50.968
I've got plenty of connections.

00:10:51.068 --> 00:10:52.572
I can even introduce
you to some of the

00:10:52.672 --> 00:10:53.907
other girls if you'd like.

00:10:54.007 --> 00:10:55.443
That sound good, right?

00:10:55.544 --> 00:10:57.113
Just say the word
and we'll do it.

00:10:57.214 --> 00:10:59.752
If Mei's okay with it,
I'm okay with it.

00:10:59.853 --> 00:11:02.123
Let's exchange numbers,
Tachibana-san.

00:11:05.764 --> 00:11:07.334
If you want to.

00:11:12.912 --> 00:11:15.016
Point and shoot and there we go.

00:11:15.116 --> 00:11:17.688
[Yamato's phone
begins to vibrate]

00:11:23.634 --> 00:11:25.436
Sorry, I need to
take this, okay?

00:11:26.338 --> 00:11:27.508
Hello?

00:11:27.608 --> 00:11:29.712
What? H-hold on!

00:11:29.812 --> 00:11:31.883
Okay, okay.

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.997
That's Yamato for you.

00:11:39.097 --> 00:11:43.607
50 yen says that call's gotta
be from one of his female fans.

00:11:43.707 --> 00:11:45.544
Doesn't it bother you?

00:11:45.644 --> 00:11:47.648
Not really.

00:11:47.748 --> 00:11:50.788
[Hayakawa] You know,
I really was surprised.

00:11:50.888 --> 00:11:52.758
You've really gotten cuter.

00:11:52.858 --> 00:11:55.196
Those eyes of yours
are really sexy.

00:11:56.967 --> 00:11:59.939
They say love has a way of
making a woman more beautiful

00:12:00.039 --> 00:12:03.145
than she ever imagined
she could be.

00:12:03.246 --> 00:12:06.218
Did Yamato really
do that to you?

00:12:06.318 --> 00:12:09.859
I... I don't know if I've
gotten any prettier...

00:12:09.959 --> 00:12:11.930
People say that
I look different,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.800
but I haven't done
anything special.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:18.376
The only thing that's
changed is that I have
Kurosawa-kun by my side.

00:12:18.476 --> 00:12:20.881
[Hayakawa] Would you consider
keeping me at your side?

00:12:24.354 --> 00:12:26.693
I don't want to interfere with
your current relationship,

00:12:26.793 --> 00:12:30.768
but I'd bet you'd become
a lot more attractive
if you dated more.

00:12:30.868 --> 00:12:33.507
And a prettier you would
make Yamato happy.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:35.911
So, whaddya say?

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:57.588
I'll never need
a friend like you.

00:12:57.688 --> 00:12:58.890
And if it's all the same to you,

00:12:58.991 --> 00:13:01.095
I can't stand being
around your creepy ass.

00:13:01.195 --> 00:13:03.466
Uh, hey...

00:13:03.567 --> 00:13:05.537
What's your problem?

00:13:05.638 --> 00:13:06.973
Hey!

00:13:11.115 --> 00:13:13.687
[Yamato] Huh? Where's Mei?

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:15.023
She took off, dude.

00:13:15.123 --> 00:13:17.528
What? What do you
mean? She left?

00:13:23.372 --> 00:13:24.776
C'mon Mei, pick up!

00:13:24.876 --> 00:13:26.312
[Recording] We're sorry,
but the telephone you are

00:13:26.412 --> 00:13:28.784
trying to reach is either
turned off or outside the

00:13:28.884 --> 00:13:31.021
service area, thank you.

00:13:31.656 --> 00:13:32.591
Hayakawa.

00:13:32.692 --> 00:13:33.827
What?

00:13:33.927 --> 00:13:35.664
Did you say something
to my girlfriend.

00:13:35.764 --> 00:13:37.367
Ah, sure I did.

00:13:37.467 --> 00:13:41.375
All I said is that she
should be open to dating
other guys, is all.

00:13:41.475 --> 00:13:45.450
But she got all stuck up
about it, then she paid
her bill and left.

00:13:45.551 --> 00:13:48.155
Can you believe it, dude?

00:13:48.255 --> 00:13:49.625
What a weirdo.

00:13:49.726 --> 00:13:51.428
What's wrong? Why
do you even care?

00:13:51.529 --> 00:13:55.136
Why would you want her
with half the girls in
school lining up for you?

00:13:57.307 --> 00:13:58.977
Shut your mouth!

00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:05.123
Mei isn't one your freakin'
subsidaters, got it!?!

00:14:05.724 --> 00:14:07.027
Mei is mine.

00:14:07.127 --> 00:14:09.331
And you better keep
your hands off.

00:14:10.667 --> 00:14:13.472
Get it through your head,
"dude." A guy like you will

00:14:13.573 --> 00:14:17.080
never have a chance with a girl
like Mei and that's a fact!

00:14:38.022 --> 00:14:39.759
[Girl 1] What's wrong,
Yamato-kun?

00:14:39.859 --> 00:14:42.097
Did Mei come to school today?

00:14:42.197 --> 00:14:44.301
[Girl 2] Mei?
[Girl 1] Tachibana?

00:14:44.401 --> 00:14:46.740
I saw her reading by
herself not that long ago.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:49.712
I see. Thanks a lot. Later.

00:14:49.812 --> 00:14:51.215
[Girl 1 &amp; 2] Later!

00:14:59.164 --> 00:15:01.770
[Mei] What's going on?

00:15:01.870 --> 00:15:04.842
[Aiko] You're kidding.
Yamato did that?

00:15:04.942 --> 00:15:06.980
I seriously couldn't
believe it.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:09.852
Has he always been like that?

00:15:09.952 --> 00:15:14.094
I guess freaks of a
feather flock together.

00:15:16.265 --> 00:15:17.735
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:15:17.835 --> 00:15:20.006
You still carrying
a torch for the guy?

00:15:20.106 --> 00:15:23.078
[Aiko] No, just surprised.
Really surprised.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:24.715
What do you mean?

00:15:24.816 --> 00:15:28.690
I've never even heard
Yamato raise his voice
to anyone before.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:30.059
[Hayakawa] What?

00:15:30.159 --> 00:15:31.830
I'm shocked that he'd
hit someone over what

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.466
they said about a girl.

00:15:33.567 --> 00:15:34.602
Tell me about it.

00:15:34.702 --> 00:15:36.806
Maybe hanging out with
a freak like Tachibana's

00:15:36.906 --> 00:15:40.146
turning Yamato into
a mental case too.

00:15:40.246 --> 00:15:42.518
Heh. You still don't
get it, do you?

00:15:42.618 --> 00:15:43.987
Huh?

00:15:44.087 --> 00:15:45.624
And you're not going to.

00:15:45.724 --> 00:15:47.962
What don't I GET exactly?

00:15:48.062 --> 00:15:49.331
Forget it, okay?

00:15:49.431 --> 00:15:50.634
Hey!

00:15:50.734 --> 00:15:53.907
I'm tired of you idiots telling
me how cool Yamato is...

00:15:54.007 --> 00:15:56.078
He isn't an angel, dammit!

00:15:56.746 --> 00:15:58.482
What?

00:16:01.155 --> 00:16:02.323
Just so you know,

00:16:02.423 --> 00:16:04.595
Yamato would never
even consider making

00:16:04.695 --> 00:16:08.135
"friends with benefits," like
you. No, he's not an angel,

00:16:08.235 --> 00:16:10.707
but he isn't a slobbering
horndog like you, either!

00:16:10.808 --> 00:16:15.249
Gimme a break. You act like
you're hot but I remember
what a cow you used to be.

00:16:18.222 --> 00:16:21.529
All that dieting's left
you covered with scars.

00:16:21.629 --> 00:16:24.301
It's just gross.

00:16:24.401 --> 00:16:27.975
I bet he'd puke if
he saw ya naked now.

00:16:35.691 --> 00:16:36.759
[Mei] Aiko-san.

00:16:39.297 --> 00:16:43.405
Speaking of gross, how
'bout those eating habits?

00:16:43.507 --> 00:16:44.575
What?

00:16:44.675 --> 00:16:47.681
I mean, you could see
everything in your mouth.

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:49.050
It was disgusting.

00:16:51.789 --> 00:16:52.791
[Hayakawa] What's your problem?

00:16:52.892 --> 00:16:54.060
[Mei] You are!

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.062
You should be ashamed with

00:16:55.162 --> 00:16:56.699
the way you treat people!

00:16:59.572 --> 00:17:03.012
Ha! Whatever, you
stupid, ugly bitches.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:05.216
What the hell!

00:17:11.696 --> 00:17:13.198
What was that for?

00:17:14.267 --> 00:17:17.006
I just told him what
I thought of him.

00:17:17.106 --> 00:17:20.446
No one likes it when
someone else gets mouthy
about their weaknesses.

00:17:20.547 --> 00:17:23.385
And he was doing
that to you, right?

00:17:23.485 --> 00:17:26.158
I think I understand what
you went through...

00:17:26.258 --> 00:17:28.395
to lose all that weight.

00:17:28.495 --> 00:17:30.099
[Yamato] Those changes are good.

00:17:30.199 --> 00:17:32.437
I don't want to hear
that shit from you!

00:17:32.538 --> 00:17:35.209
I damn near killed myself
to look like this.

00:17:35.309 --> 00:17:37.815
You don't know what
it's like to be me!

00:17:38.550 --> 00:17:40.386
[Mei] Aiko-san...

00:17:40.486 --> 00:17:44.461
I'm sorry, but I really do
admire what you've done.

00:17:44.562 --> 00:17:45.564
[Aiko] Excuse me?

00:17:45.664 --> 00:17:48.235
I swear Kurosawa-kun
didn't tell me anything,

00:17:48.335 --> 00:17:50.807
but you started dieting
because of him, didn't you?

00:17:51.876 --> 00:17:53.613
He's helped me change too.

00:17:53.713 --> 00:17:57.086
I was shy and I didn't want
to be around anybody.

00:17:57.186 --> 00:18:03.465
But... I've started to see a
world outside of myself and
started coming out of my shell.

00:18:04.669 --> 00:18:08.208
I'm so grateful to him,
you have no idea.

00:18:08.309 --> 00:18:11.816
Being around him...
lets me feel human.

00:18:11.916 --> 00:18:15.089
And I don't care whether
you've slept with him or not,

00:18:15.189 --> 00:18:18.228
I'm not giving up on
that feeling, Aiko-san.

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:20.266
Just understand this. I'm
not going to let you beat me!

00:18:35.262 --> 00:18:36.866
[Aiko] You're an
idiot, you know that?

00:18:36.966 --> 00:18:39.237
There's no battle
to be won here.

00:18:39.337 --> 00:18:42.477
And your little "I admire
you" speech is garbage.

00:18:42.578 --> 00:18:46.385
And Yamato? He already
rejected me a long time ago.

00:18:46.485 --> 00:18:48.022
Huh?

00:18:48.122 --> 00:18:49.725
Do what you want with him.

00:18:49.825 --> 00:18:52.531
Both of you are gonna
get on my nerves anyway.

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:53.900
You both suck.

00:19:02.885 --> 00:19:04.588
[Kitten mews]

00:19:06.592 --> 00:19:09.899
[Yamato] Ow! Why are you so mad?

00:19:09.999 --> 00:19:14.040
You let me horse around
with you the other day.
What's wrong with you now?

00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:17.180
[Mei] It scares him when
you hold your hand above
his head like that.

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.616
[Yamato] Mei!

00:19:20.186 --> 00:19:21.789
I finally found you.

00:19:22.825 --> 00:19:24.929
What happened to your hand?

00:19:27.066 --> 00:19:28.469
Mei...

00:19:28.570 --> 00:19:30.507
[Yamato] I'm sorry.
[Mei] Huh?

00:19:30.607 --> 00:19:34.381
I mean, Hayakawa.
He was a real jerk.

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:36.786
That wasn't your fault.
You can't blame yourself...

00:19:36.886 --> 00:19:37.921
[Yamato] No.

00:19:38.022 --> 00:19:41.094
I can. It's okay now though.

00:19:41.194 --> 00:19:43.465
I went and took care of it.

00:19:43.566 --> 00:19:47.173
Besides, I'm still trying
to win your heart, yanno.

00:19:47.273 --> 00:19:48.943
[Mei] Win my heart?

00:19:51.314 --> 00:19:53.920
Mei, are you still mad?

00:19:55.857 --> 00:19:56.959
Then what's wrong?

00:19:59.932 --> 00:20:03.506
[Mei] Did you really sleep
with her? With Aiko?

00:20:10.821 --> 00:20:13.760
[Yamato] Yeah, I did...

00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:16.264
I thought I was helping her.

00:20:16.364 --> 00:20:19.739
She was really messed
up at the time,

00:20:19.839 --> 00:20:22.343
and I was stupid...

00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:25.650
[Mei] I see.

00:20:25.751 --> 00:20:26.919
[Yamato] I'm sorry.

00:20:27.019 --> 00:20:29.759
But I really want
to be with you.

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:34.000
So, you never lie, do you?

00:20:42.483 --> 00:20:45.389
[Yamato] But that won't happen
again with anyone else.

00:20:46.692 --> 00:20:47.995
I promise.

00:20:50.065 --> 00:20:52.203
Except you, of course.

00:20:52.303 --> 00:20:54.240
Stupid ass!

00:20:54.340 --> 00:20:55.744
[Yamato] That's me.

00:20:57.246 --> 00:20:58.950
Stupid in love.

00:21:03.827 --> 00:21:04.995
Does your hand hurt?

00:21:05.095 --> 00:21:06.599
[Yamato] Kinda.

00:21:15.717 --> 00:21:20.694
<i>[Mei] We all have our scars</i>
<i>from loving someone too deeply.</i>

00:21:20.794 --> 00:21:24.835
<i>From wanting to protect</i>
<i>someone too much.</i>

00:21:24.935 --> 00:21:29.512
<i>He got this scar for me,</i>
<i>when he got angry for me.</i>

00:21:29.612 --> 00:21:32.083
<i>His hand looks like it hurts...</i>

00:21:32.183 --> 00:21:38.763
<i>I love that scar so much I</i>
<i>could just cry and cry and cry.</i>

00:21:38.863 --> 00:21:41.569
<i>I hope I never forget</i>
<i>this feeling...</i>

00:21:41.669 --> 00:21:46.077
<i>And I stopped being</i>
<i>afraid of getting hurt.</i>

00:21:46.178 --> 00:21:47.781
<i>Being with someone...</i>

00:21:47.881 --> 00:21:50.987
<i>means risking a little</i>
<i>pain now and then.</i>

00:21:51.087 --> 00:21:54.895
<i>Being with him, will always</i>
<i>make me remember...</i>

00:21:56.064 --> 00:21:57.801
<i>We all have scars.</i>

00:23:30.854 --> 00:23:33.091
[Mei] My life is so precious...

00:23:33.191 --> 00:23:36.031
So I want to trust the
path I've chosen to walk,

00:23:36.131 --> 00:23:39.905
and not let other people's
attitudes and words get
me down or hurt me.

00:23:40.005 --> 00:23:43.412
[Marshmellow] You're one step
closer to being a cat, meow.
