WEBVTT

00:00:07.248 --> 00:00:11.322
<i>[Mei] I'll probably never</i>
<i>forget that night.</i>

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:14.362
<i>Even after summer ends...</i>

00:00:27.856 --> 00:00:31.897
<i>Yamato is still by my side...</i>

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:37.542
<i>And I can still feel the warmth</i>
<i>and joy I felt on that summer</i>
<i>night at the festival.</i>

00:00:39.846 --> 00:00:41.182
[Yamato] What's wrong?

00:00:42.284 --> 00:00:43.788
Are you getting tired?

00:00:45.057 --> 00:00:47.361
No, it's not that.

00:00:47.461 --> 00:00:51.302
<i>I want to spend more time</i>
<i>with Yamato...</i>

00:00:51.402 --> 00:00:53.173
<i>I still don't know...</i>

00:00:54.275 --> 00:00:57.582
<i>...how I could possibly</i>
<i>stop loving him.</i>

00:01:03.594 --> 00:01:06.332
Should we take the long
way around this time?

00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.577
I guess my reading was correct?
What do you think?

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:12.879
[Mei] Mm?

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.050
[Yamato] Since you don't
talk much,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.256
I've mastered the skill of
reading your mind, Mei.

00:01:20.427 --> 00:01:24.268
But you know, there's still one
thing I'd like to hear from you.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:26.306
I think you know what it is.

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:09.445
[Mei's phone buzzes]

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.823
[Mei] "Sorry, I'm taking
the day off today..."

00:03:14.923 --> 00:03:20.133
Oh no. Was it because I made him
do all that walking yesterday?

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:23.406
[Asami] What? Yamato never
misses school.

00:03:23.507 --> 00:03:25.645
He must be feeling really sick.

00:03:25.745 --> 00:03:29.018
Ah I feel like I might be
getting a fever and I'm pukey.

00:03:29.118 --> 00:03:30.087
Aiko.

00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:31.489
Idiot.

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.128
So were you two fooling around
on your little walk?

00:03:34.228 --> 00:03:36.667
[Masashi] It was a little
cold yesterday.

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:38.169
Seriously, Tachibana?

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:39.906
You shouldn't act lovey
and frisky

00:03:40.006 --> 00:03:41.409
when it's cold
outside, Mei-chan.

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.215
[Mei] That's not it! That
definitely didn't happen!

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:46.653
[Asami] I am worried about
Yamato though.

00:03:50.427 --> 00:03:52.866
[Nagi] Here, eat up,
Big Brother.

00:03:52.966 --> 00:03:56.540
Nagi's Super Nutritious Get
You Healthy Pastries.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.683
Cake with powdered eel
and vitamin-rich freshly
squeezed juice.

00:04:03.119 --> 00:04:04.856
[Yamato] Too much...

00:04:04.956 --> 00:04:06.325
This is way too much...

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:07.862
Huh? What's that?

00:04:07.962 --> 00:04:09.131
It's not enough?

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:10.735
It's like this, your big brother

00:04:10.835 --> 00:04:13.473
would've been happy with just
some oatmeal or porridge. Okay?

00:04:13.574 --> 00:04:16.112
You don't know what you're
saying, Yamato ni-chan.

00:04:16.212 --> 00:04:19.385
You've got a nasty cold
and a fever too!

00:04:19.485 --> 00:04:21.623
You have to eat a lot
of food to get well.

00:04:21.723 --> 00:04:24.462
Okay. But you shouldn't have
pretended that you were sick.

00:04:24.563 --> 00:04:26.265
No more skipping school, okay?

00:04:26.365 --> 00:04:30.474
[Nagi] Look you, I'm already
letting Mei have you, isn't that
good enough?

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.079
But today, you're all mine,
Big Brother!

00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:34.983
Hey, you'll catch my cold!

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:36.385
I'm fine!

00:04:40.227 --> 00:04:44.301
[Mei moaning worriedly]

00:04:44.401 --> 00:04:47.174
She's been moaning since
the middle of homeroom.

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:49.846
Do you think that she's okay?

00:04:49.946 --> 00:04:53.353
Fine, I'll go kick her
butt out of the chair.

00:04:53.453 --> 00:04:54.656
[Aiko] Tachibana.

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:57.327
You're miserable. So go
and see him already.

00:04:57.427 --> 00:04:59.265
Aiko-san...

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:01.570
I wish you'd take care
of me when I'm sick.

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:04.108
Ehehe. You're already
sick, genius.

00:05:04.208 --> 00:05:06.212
[Masashi] Haha you bet.

00:05:06.312 --> 00:05:08.049
Hey, wait! What does that mean?

00:05:08.149 --> 00:05:09.853
Go see him. Go on.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:22.612
[Mei] Um, let's see...

00:05:22.712 --> 00:05:26.987
Cooling patches,
vitamin drinks...

00:05:27.087 --> 00:05:29.325
I'll take a stomach warmer, too.

00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.534
Hang on there, I've got
something else for you, Mei.

00:05:33.634 --> 00:05:37.509
The people who make my mud packs
sent me this little promotional
sample the other day.

00:05:37.609 --> 00:05:41.750
It's a drink mix that's supposed
to be really good for people
with skin problems.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.423
[Mei] Well, I don't think he's
got a skin cold, Mom.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:05.798
You know, it just occured to me,
should I just drop in on him
like this?

00:06:09.539 --> 00:06:11.843
I-I should text him
beforehand.

00:06:12.512 --> 00:06:16.385
[phone buzzes]

00:06:17.354 --> 00:06:18.824
Mei!

00:06:18.924 --> 00:06:22.264
"Would it be okay if I
came over for a visit?"

00:06:22.364 --> 00:06:24.068
Oh, Mei...

00:06:24.168 --> 00:06:27.642
You really don't need to
worry about something like
a little cold bug...

00:06:27.742 --> 00:06:30.447
But I wouldn't want you
to catch it either.

00:06:30.548 --> 00:06:31.817
Where did I put that mask?

00:06:31.917 --> 00:06:33.453
[door opens]

00:06:33.554 --> 00:06:38.196
Ummm... She's coming, isn't she?

00:06:38.296 --> 00:06:40.100
[Yamato] Huh? Yeah.

00:06:41.870 --> 00:06:42.939
Gimme the phone.

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:44.308
[Yamato] What?

00:06:44.408 --> 00:06:45.645
W- What are you?

00:06:48.383 --> 00:06:49.351
[Mei] Hello, Yamato?

00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.322
Oh, Mei?

00:06:51.422 --> 00:06:54.495
[Mei] Y-Yes?

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.065
It's me, Nagi.

00:06:56.165 --> 00:06:58.604
My brother said he doesn't
want to see you today.

00:06:58.704 --> 00:06:59.839
What?!

00:07:04.415 --> 00:07:07.254
[Mei] He doesn't want to see me?

00:07:07.354 --> 00:07:10.427
He doesn't want to see me?
Could it be...

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:14.703
When things were getting
a little romantic in the
park yesterday...

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:17.240
Is it because I got shy and
pushed him away?!

00:07:17.341 --> 00:07:21.482
And later that very same
afternoon he joked about
taking me home

00:07:21.583 --> 00:07:22.952
And I gave him another push.

00:07:23.052 --> 00:07:25.190
[Yamato screams]

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:29.633
And later on Yamato suggested
we try a snowboarding vacation

00:07:29.733 --> 00:07:33.841
but that meant staying
overnight together!
[Yamato yells]

00:07:33.941 --> 00:07:38.149
<i>Yamato must be angry because</i>
<i>I pushed him so many times.</i>

00:07:38.249 --> 00:07:39.919
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

00:07:45.196 --> 00:07:49.639
[Nagi] What's wrong? Why
aren't you eating anything,
Big Brother?

00:07:49.739 --> 00:07:52.277
[Yamato] I'll eat if you give
my phone back to me.

00:07:52.377 --> 00:07:55.350
[Nagi] No way!
You're all mine today!

00:07:55.450 --> 00:08:00.628
This is the only time I get to
be with you and give you my
extra special care.

00:08:02.197 --> 00:08:03.734
<i>I hope Mei's not mad...</i>

00:08:03.834 --> 00:08:05.738
<i>No, I hope she's not sad</i>

00:08:05.838 --> 00:08:08.209
<i>because she thinks I don't</i>
<i>want to see her...</i>

00:08:11.115 --> 00:08:12.719
I know, Yamato.

00:08:14.388 --> 00:08:15.891
<i>That's right.</i>

00:08:15.991 --> 00:08:19.131
<i>Mei probably knows that Nagi's</i>
<i>just being a brat.</i>

00:08:19.231 --> 00:08:20.768
<i>She's got to get it.</i>

00:08:24.542 --> 00:08:28.449
<i>Yamato is mad.</i>
<i>He's gotta be really mad.</i>

00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:29.686
<i>What should I do?</i>

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.090
[Mei's phone rings]

00:08:32.190 --> 00:08:33.092
Hello?!

00:08:33.192 --> 00:08:34.261
[Asami] Mei-chan?

00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.666
[Mei] Asami-san?

00:08:36.767 --> 00:08:38.771
It took a lot of guts
to leave early,

00:08:38.871 --> 00:08:42.678
but we're guessing you might not
be at Yamato's just quite yet.

00:08:42.779 --> 00:08:45.618
How- How did you know that?

00:08:45.718 --> 00:08:47.421
What? I was right?!

00:08:47.522 --> 00:08:52.030
Hey, everyone, Mei-chan still
hasn't gone to Yamato's
place yet.

00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:53.767
Hand it over, Asamicchi.

00:08:54.969 --> 00:08:56.673
Tachibana, don't worry about it.

00:08:56.773 --> 00:08:58.544
There isn't a man alive who
wouldn't be thrilled

00:08:58.644 --> 00:09:00.246
to have his girlfriend
over when he's sick.

00:09:00.346 --> 00:09:01.683
Damn, straight.
Matter of fact,

00:09:01.783 --> 00:09:03.520
I'd do the same for
my girlfriend.

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.423
Feel free to get sick any
time, Aiko!

00:09:05.524 --> 00:09:07.227
Shut it, jerk!

00:09:07.327 --> 00:09:08.697
[Kai] Could I talk to her?

00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.206
What's going on, Senpai?

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:16.212
K-Kai-kun?

00:09:16.312 --> 00:09:17.414
[Kai] Hey.

00:09:17.515 --> 00:09:20.487
Why aren't you going
to Yamato's place?

00:09:20.588 --> 00:09:22.324
[Mei] Um, well...

00:09:22.424 --> 00:09:26.666
I was on my way and his little
sister called me and she said...

00:09:26.767 --> 00:09:28.035
...he didn't want to see me.

00:09:28.136 --> 00:09:30.240
What?! I don't know what's
going on over there,

00:09:30.340 --> 00:09:34.281
but, Yamato's not the kind of
guy who's gonna do that to you.

00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.755
You should know that better than
anyone else, Senpai.

00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:41.596
Yeah.

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:42.765
[Kai] Good luck with that.

00:09:42.865 --> 00:09:44.969
And say hi to Yamato for me,
will ya?

00:09:48.644 --> 00:09:49.979
All right!

00:09:53.787 --> 00:09:56.091
[Megumi] Hey, what's
up everyone?

00:09:56.192 --> 00:09:57.562
Megutan.

00:09:57.662 --> 00:09:59.164
Yamato-kun is sick?

00:09:59.264 --> 00:10:03.339
[Asami] Yeah. It seems pretty
bad, so we're worried about him.

00:10:03.439 --> 00:10:05.343
Maybe I should go over there.

00:10:05.443 --> 00:10:07.748
Megumi, he's not your boyfriend.

00:10:07.849 --> 00:10:08.817
Come on, let's go.

00:10:08.917 --> 00:10:11.222
What? But I'm worried about him.

00:10:11.322 --> 00:10:12.658
[Tomo] Yeah, yeah.

00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:16.398
<i>[Mei] If he really is angry</i>
<i>at me for some reason,</i>

00:10:16.499 --> 00:10:20.774
<i>I should just go. Not "maybe",</i>
<i>not "could be", just go!</i>

00:10:20.875 --> 00:10:26.218
<i>I have to apologize at least.</i>
<i>If nothing else, give him peace</i>
<i>of mind.</i>

00:10:26.318 --> 00:10:28.724
<i>Besides, I need to explain to</i>
<i>him that I wouldn't have</i>

00:10:28.824 --> 00:10:32.932
<i>pushed him and shoved him</i>
<i>all those times if I didn't</i>
<i>like him.</i>

00:10:33.032 --> 00:10:37.975
<i>Yeah. That's it. I was just</i>
<i>being shy, you know.</i>

00:10:38.075 --> 00:10:40.614
<i>But maybe I should text</i>
<i>him again.</i>

00:10:40.714 --> 00:10:42.484
<i>No, I should call him instead.</i>

00:10:42.585 --> 00:10:46.225
<i>Well, I don't want to wake him</i>
<i>up if he's gone back to sleep.</i>

00:10:46.325 --> 00:10:51.068
<i>Okay, okay, but I could still</i>
<i>leave these gifts in front of</i>
<i>his door.</i>

00:10:58.717 --> 00:11:00.654
[Nagi] You have to rest.

00:11:00.754 --> 00:11:04.127
You're being a pain. You should
go back to sleep.

00:11:04.228 --> 00:11:06.098
Nagi...

00:11:06.198 --> 00:11:07.635
Did I get a message?

00:11:08.737 --> 00:11:10.808
Uh-uh. Sure didn't.

00:11:10.908 --> 00:11:13.881
[Nagi] Oh right... I remember.

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:17.588
Somebody told my girlfriend
I didn't want to see her today.

00:11:17.688 --> 00:11:20.728
Mei, I hope you're okay.

00:11:26.506 --> 00:11:31.115
[Yamato's phone rings]

00:11:31.215 --> 00:11:31.850
Mei?!

00:11:31.950 --> 00:11:33.085
[Kakeru] Sorry, dude.

00:11:33.185 --> 00:11:34.321
It's me, Kakeru.

00:11:36.158 --> 00:11:37.294
Kakeru?

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:41.368
[Kakeru] I heard you're sick.

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:43.306
Yeah, really sick.

00:11:43.406 --> 00:11:47.013
[Kakeru] I see. I'm sorry to
call you when you're like this,

00:11:47.113 --> 00:11:49.484
but there's something I really
have to share with you, dude.

00:11:49.586 --> 00:11:51.723
What are you being
so serious about?

00:11:51.823 --> 00:11:54.461
[Kakeru] Well, I finally
got a girlfriend.

00:11:54.562 --> 00:11:55.798
Huh?

00:11:55.898 --> 00:12:00.173
[Kakeru] I know, I know
"Not Kakeru."

00:12:00.273 --> 00:12:03.614
I finally decided I was finished
with all the playing around.

00:12:03.714 --> 00:12:08.489
I finally found a gem underneath
all those rocks I was kicking
around all that time.

00:12:09.659 --> 00:12:11.262
Oh my god.

00:12:13.065 --> 00:12:14.969
I'm happy for you, man.

00:12:15.069 --> 00:12:22.150
Thanks, dude. Get this, she's
even got a job at some place
called Bakery Farm.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.524
I'm headed there right now,
we've got a date today.

00:12:25.624 --> 00:12:26.927
Huh?

00:12:27.027 --> 00:12:29.364
[Kakeru] Just wanted to share
the good news, dude.

00:12:29.464 --> 00:12:30.300
Later.

00:12:30.400 --> 00:12:31.736
Hey, wait.

00:12:33.205 --> 00:12:34.341
Bakery Farm?

00:12:35.043 --> 00:12:37.314
<i>Mei works at Bakery Farm.</i>

00:12:39.084 --> 00:12:42.959
What the hell? Is he...

00:12:43.059 --> 00:12:45.898
Going out on a date
with my Mei?!

00:12:52.912 --> 00:12:55.918
[Yamato] Hayakawa and me we're
still friends right?

00:12:56.018 --> 00:12:59.257
I know I hit him but jeeze,
it can't be.

00:12:59.358 --> 00:13:04.569
Kakeru has a girlfriend, and she
has a job at Bakery Farm?

00:13:04.669 --> 00:13:08.209
Only Mei and that old woman work
at Bakery Farm, right?

00:13:08.309 --> 00:13:12.818
But that's just crazy. Even a
playboy like Kakeru wouldn't

00:13:12.918 --> 00:13:15.423
go for that old lady that runs
the place.

00:13:15.524 --> 00:13:16.760
Kakeru-kun!

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.466
[Yamato] No way. Then... then...

00:13:20.567 --> 00:13:23.540
Mei?! Is it really you, Mei?!

00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.009
What? What about Mei?

00:13:25.109 --> 00:13:27.515
You got her angry and now
shes going out with

00:13:27.615 --> 00:13:29.484
Kakeru instead of me!

00:13:29.585 --> 00:13:33.025
That's it. She pushed me away
all of those times yesterday...

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:34.962
Mei, you thought I was acting
sick and disgusting...

00:13:35.063 --> 00:13:37.902
Oh my god! What am I going
to do?

00:13:38.002 --> 00:13:39.539
Yamato, are you okay?

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:41.509
Keep it together, Big Brother!

00:13:41.609 --> 00:13:43.045
No, it can't be.

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:45.016
Mei would never do that to me.

00:13:45.116 --> 00:13:48.890
I can't take anymore!
I'm going! I'm going!

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:50.594
Get back into bed!

00:13:52.698 --> 00:13:54.067
Mei...

00:14:05.691 --> 00:14:08.930
[Mei] Oh... I'm just gonna
bother him.

00:14:12.237 --> 00:14:14.942
Darnit! I came this far...

00:14:24.461 --> 00:14:28.102
[Mei] The button, all I have
to do is push it.

00:14:29.539 --> 00:14:32.077
I must! And I will!

00:14:39.324 --> 00:14:40.460
Yamato...

00:14:42.263 --> 00:14:45.904
<i>[Nagi] My brother said he</i>
<i>doesn't want to see you today.</i>

00:14:50.581 --> 00:14:54.789
<i>[Mei] No... There's no way</i>
<i>Yamato would say that...</i>

00:14:54.889 --> 00:14:56.225
But...

00:15:22.745 --> 00:15:25.450
<i>A classmate of Nagi-san?</i>

00:15:28.857 --> 00:15:31.295
[Mei] Are you here because
you're worried about Nagi-san,

00:15:31.395 --> 00:15:33.332
since she stayed home
sick from school?

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:37.775
[Classmate] Uh yeah. I thought
it might be a bother since she's
home sick,

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:39.912
but I really want to see her...

00:15:42.250 --> 00:15:43.820
[Mei] That's wonderful.

00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:45.123
Huh?

00:15:45.223 --> 00:15:49.498
Nagi-san ought to be
really happy with those.

00:15:49.599 --> 00:15:51.769
You don't think I'm bugging
her, do you?

00:15:51.870 --> 00:15:55.711
It's all right. I bet you
understand how Nagi-san feels

00:15:55.811 --> 00:15:58.215
better than anyone else,
don't you?

00:16:02.390 --> 00:16:05.163
[Classmate] I'm gonna give
her these flowers.

00:16:05.263 --> 00:16:07.066
<i>[Mei] He's just like me.</i>

00:16:07.167 --> 00:16:08.435
<i>He loves her so much,</i>

00:16:08.537 --> 00:16:10.974
<i>he just can't help wanting</i>
<i>to be with her.</i>

00:16:14.515 --> 00:16:15.651
[doorbell rings]

00:16:18.355 --> 00:16:19.992
Who's at the gate, please?

00:16:20.092 --> 00:16:22.832
[Classmate] Oh, um... It's me.

00:16:22.932 --> 00:16:25.102
Wait a minute,
I'll be right there!

00:16:25.203 --> 00:16:26.606
That's great, Nagi.

00:16:28.042 --> 00:16:29.612
I'm going out, too!

00:16:38.195 --> 00:16:39.565
<i>[Yamato] Mei!</i>

00:16:48.617 --> 00:16:50.554
[Chiharu] Thanks for coming
and waiting.

00:16:50.654 --> 00:16:51.556
[Kakeru] No problem.

00:16:51.656 --> 00:16:52.892
You want to go somewhere?

00:16:52.992 --> 00:16:54.127
Yeah, sure.

00:16:54.227 --> 00:16:55.898
Well, let's start wandering
around then.

00:16:55.998 --> 00:16:57.333
Okay.

00:17:04.715 --> 00:17:06.218
Looks like they're okay.

00:17:06.318 --> 00:17:08.623
Guess I ran over here
for no reason.

00:17:08.723 --> 00:17:10.827
Mei! I forgot all about her.

00:17:10.928 --> 00:17:12.096
I need to apologize to her!

00:17:12.196 --> 00:17:13.867
[Manager] Hang on a second.
[Yamato] Yes?

00:17:13.967 --> 00:17:17.340
You're the model that was in
Dessert with Megutan,
aren't you?

00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:21.950
Oh, my god! You're even thinner
than in your magazine photos!

00:17:22.050 --> 00:17:23.352
Uh, oh, uh...

00:17:23.452 --> 00:17:25.724
[Manager] I've been reading
your magazine!

00:17:25.824 --> 00:17:29.331
You haven't been in it lately,
so I was wondering what
happened,

00:17:29.431 --> 00:17:31.368
but... You're not sick, are you?

00:17:31.468 --> 00:17:34.074
[Yamato] Uh... Actually, I don't
feel very well.

00:17:34.174 --> 00:17:37.247
You're sick? My, how horrible!

00:17:37.347 --> 00:17:39.952
I've got a bread that'll fix
it up in no time!

00:17:40.052 --> 00:17:43.259
[Manager] It's very nutritious!
Wait right there!
[Yamato] No, I...

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:48.870
[Kai] Still playing the nice
guy I see.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.072
[Yamato] Kai.

00:17:50.172 --> 00:17:51.976
I'll handle your secret
admirer there.

00:17:52.076 --> 00:17:53.713
You need to find
your girlfriend.

00:17:53.813 --> 00:17:56.084
She's worried about you.

00:17:56.184 --> 00:17:57.888
She's mooning and moping
around because

00:17:57.988 --> 00:18:01.596
she thinks she made you sick and
that you don't want to see her.

00:18:03.232 --> 00:18:06.371
Hang on. How could you possibly
know all that?

00:18:06.471 --> 00:18:08.643
You haven't been following Mei
around, have you?

00:18:08.743 --> 00:18:10.079
What? Knucklehead.

00:18:10.179 --> 00:18:13.620
Asami-chan talked to her on the
phone during recess.

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.857
[Manager] Thanks for waiting!
[Kai] Go on, move your ass!

00:18:18.329 --> 00:18:20.099
Thanks, Takemura.

00:18:21.068 --> 00:18:22.236
Sure.

00:18:25.644 --> 00:18:29.217
Oh, hey big fella.
Where did the other guy go?

00:18:29.317 --> 00:18:31.823
Oh, the other guy's
Mei's boyfriend.

00:18:31.923 --> 00:18:34.427
What? My, my, my...

00:18:34.528 --> 00:18:37.367
That's wonderful, Mei-chan!

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:45.383
I'm glad that you're not really
that sick, Nagi.

00:18:45.483 --> 00:18:47.588
Sorry for making you worry.

00:18:49.224 --> 00:18:51.228
<i>Love is so wonderful.</i>

00:18:51.929 --> 00:18:53.465
Oh, Yamato.

00:19:00.881 --> 00:19:03.720
So, are you going to answer?

00:19:07.795 --> 00:19:08.830
Mei!

00:19:08.930 --> 00:19:11.536
Hello... [phone beeping]

00:19:11.636 --> 00:19:12.638
Huh?

00:19:16.011 --> 00:19:20.219
[dial tone]

00:19:20.319 --> 00:19:24.160
<i>He's mad. I knew Yamato</i>
<i>was mad.</i>

00:19:24.829 --> 00:19:26.733
Come on! Why now?

00:19:31.776 --> 00:19:33.513
<i>I shouldn't have come.</i>

00:19:35.149 --> 00:19:36.753
<i>How did this happen?</i>

00:19:38.255 --> 00:19:40.192
<i>But I love Yamato so much...</i>

00:19:40.292 --> 00:19:41.896
<i>I want to tell him!</i>

00:19:44.702 --> 00:19:49.444
<i>It's so simple,</i>
<i>but it's hard too.</i>

00:19:49.545 --> 00:19:56.058
<i>I thought everything was going</i>
<i>well, but maybe I still don't</i>
<i>get it and I never will.</i>

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:58.730
<i>I can't stop my feelings</i>
<i>for him...</i>

00:20:06.211 --> 00:20:07.948
[Yamato] Hey, you're early.

00:20:09.217 --> 00:20:10.754
So are you.

00:20:10.854 --> 00:20:13.392
[Yamato] I always arrive ten
minutes early.

00:20:16.264 --> 00:20:21.007
So what you're saying just now
is, I made you wait 30 minutes
instead of 20 minutes

00:20:21.108 --> 00:20:22.778
for the first date we went on?

00:20:22.878 --> 00:20:24.013
Sorry about that.

00:20:24.114 --> 00:20:26.519
It's okay.

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:29.357
I'd rather wait for someone
instead of making them wait.

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:40.312
Yamato...

00:20:48.630 --> 00:20:49.932
<i>Yamato.</i>

00:20:51.034 --> 00:20:56.211
<i>If you're mad, please let me</i>
<i>apologize to you.</i>

00:20:56.311 --> 00:20:58.983
<i>Let me apologize for making</i>
<i>you angry.</i>

00:20:59.083 --> 00:21:02.925
<i>And please let me tell you how</i>
<i>I really feel...</i>

00:21:08.168 --> 00:21:09.738
[running footsteps]

00:21:09.839 --> 00:21:10.974
[Yamato] Mei!

00:21:24.735 --> 00:21:27.440
Mei... I finally found you...

00:21:32.951 --> 00:21:34.354
I'm sorry,

00:21:34.454 --> 00:21:38.963
I... need to... apologize
to you...

00:21:42.704 --> 00:21:43.840
Mei I...

00:22:03.646 --> 00:22:07.019
I'm sorry for the mix up.
Nagi had my phone...

00:22:07.521 --> 00:22:08.923
[Mei] It's okay.

00:23:38.235 --> 00:23:39.571
[Mei] I love you.
