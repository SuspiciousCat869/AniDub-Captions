WEBVTT

00:00:02.506 --> 00:00:04.910
[Megumi] What? You're
going to quit modeling?

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:07.348
[Yamato] Yeah.
[Megumi] Why?

00:00:07.448 --> 00:00:10.755
Because I was making Mei sad.

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.393
I made her feel uncertain
about all sorts of things.

00:00:13.493 --> 00:00:17.736
But you're just getting
started, Yamato.

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:19.606
I was never in a rush to try it.

00:00:19.706 --> 00:00:22.411
And Mei's feelings are
far more important.

00:00:22.512 --> 00:00:25.852
That's it. I'm done
with modeling.

00:00:25.952 --> 00:00:28.423
Ah, aw, come on, Yamato.

00:00:28.524 --> 00:00:30.327
Are you really gonna quit just
because of your girlfriend?

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:33.534
When it comes to the
people in your life
that you really love...

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:37.509
All of the petty things
that you wanted just stop
being important to you.

00:00:40.582 --> 00:00:43.186
You're not acting like a
prince at all, you know that.

00:00:43.286 --> 00:00:46.594
I was never a prince, okay.

00:00:46.694 --> 00:00:49.633
And Mei is the only
admirer I'll ever need.

00:02:39.285 --> 00:02:41.724
I see you fixed
your bracelet, nice.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.702
So, you wanna go home together?

00:02:55.183 --> 00:02:56.520
[Asami] Mei-chan...

00:02:58.958 --> 00:03:00.060
Are you okay?

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.164
You looked kind of
depressed yesterday.

00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:04.736
Oh, Asami-chan.

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:08.443
Sorry for making
you worry so much.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:10.080
Did you talk to Yamato yet?

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.683
Yes.

00:03:11.784 --> 00:03:12.952
Then it should be fine.

00:03:13.053 --> 00:03:15.123
That's awesome!

00:03:15.223 --> 00:03:18.063
No, you guys are the
ones who are awesome.

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:22.271
I can't... thank you enough.

00:03:22.772 --> 00:03:24.208
Mei-chan...

00:03:24.308 --> 00:03:26.345
Well, we'll always
be there for you if

00:03:26.446 --> 00:03:30.320
something else comes up
with you and Yamato, okay?

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.525
[Megumi] Hey, Asami-chan!

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:35.565
Do you want to come hang out
at the studio with me today?

00:03:35.665 --> 00:03:37.401
I'm having a shoot
with Ami-chan,

00:03:37.502 --> 00:03:39.205
the amateur model
you wanted to meet.

00:03:39.305 --> 00:03:41.442
Asami-chan, I'll
introduce you to her.

00:03:41.543 --> 00:03:43.279
[Asami] Uh, yeah, but...

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:45.885
Don't you have plans
with Nakanishi today?

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:47.020
Yeah.

00:03:47.121 --> 00:03:48.256
I'm sorry, Megu-tan.

00:03:48.356 --> 00:03:49.492
Oh, that's fine.

00:03:49.593 --> 00:03:51.462
We'll try doing it
again some other time.

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:55.938
Hey, Nao-chan. I'm seeing
Ami-chan the model today.
Do you want to come with me?

00:03:56.038 --> 00:03:57.675
[The conversation between Nao
and Megumi continues]

00:03:57.776 --> 00:04:00.848
That girl... is always dangling
bait in front of people.

00:04:00.948 --> 00:04:04.623
Uh, I'm really sure she's
trying to do that, Aiko-chan.

00:04:04.723 --> 00:04:06.860
Is she mad at you or something?

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.503
Miss Hyper-perky was
definitely trying to avoid
eye contact with you.

00:04:15.545 --> 00:04:18.183
<i>[Mei] I wonder if Megumi-san...</i>

00:04:18.283 --> 00:04:20.755
<i>I guess she has</i>
<i>feelings for Yamato.</i>

00:04:22.024 --> 00:04:23.861
<i>But I...</i>

00:04:23.961 --> 00:04:25.531
<i>I do too.</i>

00:04:25.631 --> 00:04:28.269
Anyway, we were talking about
how we wouldn't have as much

00:04:28.369 --> 00:04:31.075
time to see each during
finals, so we just decided

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:33.948
it'd be better if we
studied together.

00:04:34.048 --> 00:04:35.050
That's awesome.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.820
[Nakanishi] Isn't it? Isn't it?

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.699
<i>[Megumi] Why isn't it me?</i>

00:04:43.801 --> 00:04:44.970
<i>Why?</i>

00:04:49.445 --> 00:04:52.317
[Yamato] Did you have any
trouble fixing the bracelet?

00:04:52.417 --> 00:04:54.155
[Mei] A little.

00:04:54.255 --> 00:04:55.725
[Yamato] But you fixed it.

00:05:00.535 --> 00:05:01.737
[Mei] Whenever I wear this,

00:05:01.837 --> 00:05:04.943
I feel like you'll
always be by my side.

00:05:05.043 --> 00:05:07.080
That we'll always be together.

00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:10.521
It's like telling me
that I'm not alone.

00:05:20.073 --> 00:05:20.975
Later.

00:05:21.075 --> 00:05:22.512
We're already at the bakery?

00:05:22.612 --> 00:05:24.783
Man, that sure was quick.

00:05:29.158 --> 00:05:31.229
Oh, I've got an idea.

00:05:31.329 --> 00:05:33.701
There's something I want
to buy in this area.

00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:36.405
Would it be all right if I
waited for you to finish work?

00:05:38.343 --> 00:05:39.679
Mmhmm.

00:05:44.488 --> 00:05:46.092
[Masahi] Yamato!

00:05:46.192 --> 00:05:47.529
[Yamato] Hey.

00:05:48.697 --> 00:05:50.233
We're about to go to karaoke.

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:51.570
You wanna come with us?

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.874
Sorry, I've got
some shopping to do.

00:05:53.974 --> 00:05:54.943
Where's Tachibana?

00:05:55.043 --> 00:05:55.978
At work.

00:05:56.078 --> 00:05:57.582
What are you shopping for?

00:05:57.682 --> 00:06:00.821
Well... It's kinda,
well. One of those...

00:06:00.922 --> 00:06:02.525
Turning red, bud.

00:06:02.625 --> 00:06:05.030
Come on, let's go.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:06.165
Say "hi" to Mei for me.

00:06:06.265 --> 00:06:07.067
[Yamato] Sure.

00:06:07.167 --> 00:06:08.771
About yesterday, Aiko.

00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.806
Thanks for the help.

00:06:09.906 --> 00:06:11.108
[Aiko] Sure thing.

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:12.244
What was yesterday?

00:06:12.344 --> 00:06:13.948
[Aiko] Nothing. Come on.

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:16.419
Come oooon! Tell me!

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.857
Hey, Aiko. Hey, come on.

00:06:18.958 --> 00:06:20.795
You're a pain in the ass,
let's go already. God.

00:06:49.418 --> 00:06:51.990
Welcome to Bakery Farm. Huh?

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.560
[Lady] It's the big boy.

00:06:53.661 --> 00:06:56.667
Welcome. Thanks
for coming again.

00:06:56.767 --> 00:06:57.936
Hey.

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:12.632
Still got an hour left.

00:07:12.732 --> 00:07:14.034
[Kai] I'd like these.

00:07:14.936 --> 00:07:16.673
Thank you very much.

00:07:21.415 --> 00:07:23.554
If I could, I'd also
like to get that...

00:07:23.654 --> 00:07:25.156
You can't have it.

00:07:25.256 --> 00:07:26.526
I know. I was just...

00:07:26.627 --> 00:07:29.264
pulling your leg again, really.

00:07:29.365 --> 00:07:32.371
You really like Land,
don't you, Takemura?

00:07:32.471 --> 00:07:34.542
Nothing makes me happier.

00:07:37.548 --> 00:07:39.619
There's something
I need to ask you.

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:42.792
You do know about the jinx
on that magic key, right?

00:07:42.892 --> 00:07:43.794
What jinx?

00:07:43.894 --> 00:07:45.463
You're saying you
really don't know?!

00:07:45.564 --> 00:07:48.002
And you're still
wearing that thing?!

00:07:48.102 --> 00:07:49.606
Yes, I am.

00:07:51.008 --> 00:07:54.683
Okay. See the ring on
the side of the key?

00:07:54.783 --> 00:07:58.289
If you write your wish
on a yellow ribbon and
tie it on there,

00:07:58.389 --> 00:08:00.961
it's suppose to come true.

00:08:01.062 --> 00:08:03.701
If a couple attaches
matching ribbons,

00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:07.040
they say their love
will last forever.

00:08:09.746 --> 00:08:14.321
Okay, you have a boyfriend.

00:08:14.421 --> 00:08:15.925
You're so honest,
it's really cute.

00:08:16.025 --> 00:08:20.400
[Lady] Mei-chan, you should have
told me you had a boyfriend.

00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:22.939
You're such a secretive girl.

00:08:23.039 --> 00:08:24.809
I'm sorry.

00:08:25.778 --> 00:08:28.049
You're really interesting,
you know that?

00:08:42.411 --> 00:08:44.549
Good work.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:45.985
Sorry for making you wait.

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:48.590
[Yamato] It's okay.
When I was modeling,

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:51.328
I made you wait for me a lot.

00:08:51.429 --> 00:08:52.899
It's okay, really.

00:08:52.999 --> 00:08:54.803
I'm still sorry.

00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:57.140
It's fine.

00:09:05.156 --> 00:09:08.864
<i>[Mei] Oh, what</i>
<i>should I talk about?</i>

00:09:08.964 --> 00:09:12.237
<i>I should have a lot to say...</i>

00:09:12.337 --> 00:09:13.741
There's a lot I want to say,

00:09:13.841 --> 00:09:17.114
but the words never seem to
come out at times like this.

00:09:17.214 --> 00:09:18.282
What?

00:09:18.382 --> 00:09:21.690
I was just thinking
the same thing.

00:09:22.457 --> 00:09:24.027
I see.

00:09:32.712 --> 00:09:37.120
[Yamato] Man... We got
here too fast again.
[Mei] Yeah.

00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.362
You know, it's times like
this when I wish you
lived farther away,

00:09:41.462 --> 00:09:43.132
about three days
away would be good.

00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:45.370
No, I don't really think so.

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.873
Okay.

00:09:55.925 --> 00:09:58.095
[Mei] Why don't you come
in and use our dryer?

00:09:58.196 --> 00:10:00.066
[Yamato] Huh?

00:10:00.166 --> 00:10:03.406
[Mei] Your coat and
shirt... they're soaked.

00:10:03.507 --> 00:10:04.843
Oh...

00:10:17.067 --> 00:10:18.637
Sorry, but nothing me and
my mom have will fit you.

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:23.547
Uh, no. It's fine. I'm not cold.

00:10:23.647 --> 00:10:26.753
If anything, I'm totally
sweating over here.

00:10:27.688 --> 00:10:29.224
Your face is red.

00:10:29.324 --> 00:10:30.761
So is yours.

00:10:38.109 --> 00:10:41.348
Thanks a lot. For taking care
of your bracelet, I mean.

00:10:42.117 --> 00:10:43.386
I'm glad to.

00:10:44.589 --> 00:10:45.925
Here.

00:10:46.593 --> 00:10:48.897
These will never break.

00:10:48.997 --> 00:10:50.233
Go ahead.

00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:58.817
That's what I was shopping
for, pair rings.

00:10:59.619 --> 00:11:01.890
[Mei] You have one
too, Kurosawa?

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.827
[Yamato] Kurosawa? Still?

00:11:07.535 --> 00:11:11.776
I've actually wanted to call
you Yamato for a while now.

00:11:11.877 --> 00:11:13.947
I wanted you to
call me that, too.

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:16.085
I told you that I won't mind it.

00:11:16.185 --> 00:11:21.295
Today, I... I guess I'm
just nervous about it.

00:11:22.330 --> 00:11:23.667
[Yamato] Me, too.

00:11:27.440 --> 00:11:28.810
Sorry.

00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.948
I just want to stay like this.

00:11:33.419 --> 00:11:34.889
[Mei sniffs Yamato]

00:11:34.989 --> 00:11:37.460
[Mei] I really like
your smell...

00:11:39.666 --> 00:11:41.836
[Yamato] Mei!
[Crashing sounds]

00:11:53.727 --> 00:11:55.263
[Ms. Tachibana] I'm home!

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.269
Mei?

00:11:59.438 --> 00:12:01.843
Help me get dinner ready.

00:12:12.832 --> 00:12:16.372
[Ms. Tachibana] Of course
I'd have no make up on
at a time like this.

00:12:16.472 --> 00:12:18.209
I'm so sorry.

00:12:18.309 --> 00:12:21.415
[Yamato] No, I shouldn't be in
your house with no shirt on.

00:12:21.516 --> 00:12:23.921
[Ms. Tachibana] It's fine.
Make yourself at home.

00:12:24.021 --> 00:12:26.660
No, uh... I'm sorry.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:28.630
You don't really
need to apologize.

00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.066
But...

00:12:30.166 --> 00:12:31.068
So tell me.

00:12:31.168 --> 00:12:33.774
You're Mei's boyfriend,
is that right?

00:12:33.874 --> 00:12:37.013
Yes. Sorry about that...

00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:40.754
[Ms. Tachibana] Mei, sounds like
your boyfriend is embarassed.

00:12:40.854 --> 00:12:43.125
Wow, I'm sorry, darling.

00:12:43.225 --> 00:12:44.595
She's always like this at home.

00:12:44.696 --> 00:12:46.866
Is she this quiet
and shy at school?

00:12:46.967 --> 00:12:49.204
[Mei] Mom!
[Yamato] N-no. No.

00:12:49.304 --> 00:12:53.947
Mei is... I mean, Mei-sama,
is strong and charming.

00:12:54.047 --> 00:12:56.786
I-I really respect her a lot.

00:12:59.559 --> 00:13:01.696
Okay, aren't you exaggerating?

00:13:01.796 --> 00:13:04.969
Mei-sama doesn't bow
to peer pressure.

00:13:05.069 --> 00:13:07.007
She's always sure of herself,

00:13:07.107 --> 00:13:10.046
but she's still thoughtful
and kind to other people.

00:13:11.448 --> 00:13:13.052
She's wonderful, ma'am.

00:13:16.492 --> 00:13:20.868
Really? That's the first time
anyone's said that about her.

00:13:20.968 --> 00:13:22.571
She's always been all
of those things.

00:13:22.672 --> 00:13:25.611
Kind, respectful, and
considerate, ever
since she was little.

00:13:25.711 --> 00:13:29.819
I've been spending a lot
of time wondering if
anyone else would see it.

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:32.257
That's so sweet of you.

00:13:32.625 --> 00:13:33.960
Mom...

00:13:34.896 --> 00:13:37.868
Oh my, I'm getting misty.

00:13:39.004 --> 00:13:41.810
[Marshmallow meows]

00:13:41.910 --> 00:13:44.281
[Yamato] Marshmallow,
good to see you again.

00:13:45.951 --> 00:13:47.555
[Ms. Tachibana] Thank you.

00:13:47.655 --> 00:13:49.826
I'm glad you met my daughter.

00:13:50.994 --> 00:13:52.430
[Yamato] Thank you.

00:13:53.299 --> 00:13:54.535
She's wonderful.

00:13:58.944 --> 00:14:01.248
[Marshmallow meows loudly]

00:14:02.417 --> 00:14:03.386
[Mei] Yamato.

00:14:03.486 --> 00:14:05.156
Huh?

00:14:05.256 --> 00:14:06.860
[Mei] Thanks.
[Yamato] Huh?

00:14:06.960 --> 00:14:08.129
That's the first time I've seen

00:14:08.229 --> 00:14:11.235
my mother look so at
ease around somebody.

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.940
It's all because of you.

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:16.311
Thanks a lot.

00:14:16.412 --> 00:14:17.615
Mei...

00:14:26.699 --> 00:14:28.002
[Asami] Mei-chan!

00:14:28.102 --> 00:14:29.872
Hang on just one minute!

00:14:29.972 --> 00:14:32.444
Is that a pair ring I see?

00:14:33.412 --> 00:14:34.347
[Mei] Yes.

00:14:34.448 --> 00:14:37.187
Yamato bought it
for you, didn't he?

00:14:37.287 --> 00:14:39.491
Ye... Yes.

00:14:39.592 --> 00:14:43.232
[Asami] That is so
amazing! Congratulations!

00:14:43.332 --> 00:14:44.167
It's not...

00:14:44.267 --> 00:14:46.740
[Aiko] It's not an
engagement ring.

00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:48.577
I bet you're really
happy though.

00:14:48.677 --> 00:14:51.181
Oh, Mei-chan, that
is so awesome!

00:14:51.281 --> 00:14:52.852
Uh... Yes.

00:14:52.952 --> 00:14:54.454
Anyway, the cafe's owner and

00:14:54.555 --> 00:14:57.393
my agency's manager were
friends back in the day.

00:14:57.494 --> 00:14:58.530
What? Really?

00:14:58.630 --> 00:15:00.266
That's crazy.

00:15:04.976 --> 00:15:06.780
[Megumi] They said I could
stop by any time I like.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.048
[Girl] That's amazing.

00:15:08.149 --> 00:15:09.886
[Megumi] Let's all
go together sometime.

00:15:09.986 --> 00:15:11.321
[Girl] Seriously?

00:15:16.165 --> 00:15:19.639
<i>[Mei] So... I finally</i>
<i>started calling him Yamato.</i>

00:15:23.479 --> 00:15:25.349
<i>Even if it rains...</i>

00:15:27.187 --> 00:15:28.690
<i>Or if it's sunny...</i>

00:15:31.830 --> 00:15:35.470
<i>Even when the winter wind</i>
<i>blows, and it grows cold...</i>

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.948
<i>I spend my days peacefully</i>
<i>with Yamato and my friends.</i>

00:15:42.150 --> 00:15:44.956
<i>I never would have imagined...</i>

00:15:45.056 --> 00:15:50.032
<i>That I could spend my</i>
<i>days... like this.</i>

00:16:02.958 --> 00:16:04.194
[Kai] Hey, Yamato.

00:16:04.294 --> 00:16:05.697
Huh?

00:16:05.797 --> 00:16:06.966
Hey.

00:16:07.066 --> 00:16:10.641
Remember me? It's
Kai. Kai Takemura.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:23.465
[Teacher] Hey, Takemura!
I told you to come to
the faculty office!

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:26.739
Yeah! Be right there.

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:29.244
So Yamato's your boyfriend?

00:16:30.012 --> 00:16:31.215
See you later, Yamato.

00:16:31.315 --> 00:16:32.450
Yeah.

00:16:35.657 --> 00:16:38.028
I heard there was a rumor
going around, but...

00:16:38.128 --> 00:16:40.601
Takemura-kun really
is back in school.

00:16:40.701 --> 00:16:41.803
[Aiko] You know him?

00:16:41.903 --> 00:16:42.938
[Asami] We knew him
in middle school,

00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:44.509
right, Yamato?

00:16:44.609 --> 00:16:45.744
Yeah.

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:57.267
That was unexpected. I'm
seriously surprised that

00:16:57.367 --> 00:16:59.237
Kai transferred back
here for school.

00:16:59.337 --> 00:17:00.674
And a year below us, too.

00:17:00.774 --> 00:17:01.910
Is he your friend?

00:17:02.010 --> 00:17:06.418
Well... he might not
think I am anymore.

00:17:08.523 --> 00:17:10.026
I told you before.

00:17:10.126 --> 00:17:12.030
In middle school, my best friend

00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.002
was teased and tortured
by some pretty bad guys.

00:17:15.102 --> 00:17:20.279
I... talked to him when I
wasn't risking a butt-kicking
of my own for doing it.

00:17:20.379 --> 00:17:23.653
I couldn't help. He
ended up transferring.

00:17:24.956 --> 00:17:26.526
That's him, alright.

00:17:28.095 --> 00:17:30.333
He's gotten big. I mean huge.

00:17:30.433 --> 00:17:33.272
I don't think anyone's
gonna bully him now.

00:17:33.372 --> 00:17:34.942
[Mei] He likes Land, apparently.

00:17:35.042 --> 00:17:39.084
Huh? It's kind of strange, but
where do you know Takemura from?

00:17:39.184 --> 00:17:41.856
He's been dropping by
the Bakery Farm a lot.

00:17:41.956 --> 00:17:43.292
He likes sweets, huh?

00:17:43.392 --> 00:17:44.629
Mhm.

00:17:46.265 --> 00:17:47.935
[Mei] Well, see you tomorrow.

00:17:48.035 --> 00:17:49.605
Okay. Work hard.

00:17:54.649 --> 00:17:55.483
Hey.

00:17:55.584 --> 00:17:56.920
[Mei] Welcome back.

00:17:57.020 --> 00:17:58.623
Good to see ya. Senpai,

00:17:58.723 --> 00:18:01.596
they finally finished
my transfer paperwork.

00:18:01.696 --> 00:18:04.234
You were classmates with
Yamato, weren't you?

00:18:04.334 --> 00:18:08.242
Yeah, we were. I guess he
told you about the bullying.

00:18:09.645 --> 00:18:11.148
Well, he told me...

00:18:11.248 --> 00:18:15.657
about how he had to pretend
he didn't notice what was
happening to you.

00:18:18.028 --> 00:18:20.600
Well that's about to change.

00:18:20.701 --> 00:18:24.207
Me? I'm coming back to get
my revenge on all of 'em.

00:18:24.307 --> 00:18:26.713
And that's a fact.

00:18:26.813 --> 00:18:30.954
I took a year off to get
bigger. Got taller too.

00:18:31.054 --> 00:18:32.691
The fights are gonna be epic.

00:18:32.791 --> 00:18:34.094
[Mei] What you're planning...

00:18:34.194 --> 00:18:36.699
Isn't that the same as what
those guys did to you?

00:18:36.799 --> 00:18:39.270
Is bullying them really
going to change anything?

00:18:39.371 --> 00:18:41.408
Just what will that help?

00:18:41.509 --> 00:18:43.445
[Kai] I wouldn't expect
you to understand.

00:18:43.546 --> 00:18:45.617
You haven't been bullied before.

00:18:46.819 --> 00:18:50.694
Yes I have. I've been bullied.

00:18:50.794 --> 00:18:54.602
And I've only recently
started to meet people I
could count on as friends.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.342
It hurt, but I got past it.

00:18:58.442 --> 00:19:01.348
I know I'd be happier if the
people who used to bully me

00:19:01.448 --> 00:19:05.757
took the time to get to know
me for who I am now instead.

00:19:05.857 --> 00:19:10.399
[Kai] That might work for
you, but the guys who hurt
me only understand force.

00:19:10.499 --> 00:19:11.903
And I'll give it to them.

00:19:13.807 --> 00:19:15.142
[Mei] Um...

00:19:16.378 --> 00:19:18.717
Would you like this?
They gave me this,

00:19:18.817 --> 00:19:21.088
but I really don't eat
that many sweets myself.

00:19:21.188 --> 00:19:25.129
I know you're always buying
glazed and cream filled
snacks from the bakery.

00:19:25.229 --> 00:19:29.337
So I thought you might
really enjoy it and
want to give it a try.

00:19:31.709 --> 00:19:33.680
Thanks. Later.

00:19:46.238 --> 00:19:47.574
[Kai panicking]

00:19:48.375 --> 00:19:49.177
[Kai yelling]

00:19:49.277 --> 00:19:50.614
[Kai] No!

00:19:52.150 --> 00:19:56.258
They'll see. They'll be the
ones screaming for me to stop.

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:04.575
<i>[Kai] He's kind of tall.</i>
<i>Pretty scary lookin'.</i>

00:20:04.675 --> 00:20:08.950
<i>He's got a few acne scars</i>
<i>and a mole near his mouth.</i>

00:20:12.090 --> 00:20:13.459
<i>That's him.</i>

00:20:19.070 --> 00:20:21.208
<i>That's gotta be him.</i>

00:20:21.308 --> 00:20:23.913
<i>This is it, you son of a bitch.</i>

00:20:24.013 --> 00:20:27.654
<i>Look me in the eye so I can</i>
<i>get a good shot at your face.</i>

00:20:27.755 --> 00:20:28.790
[Kai] Hey...

00:20:31.128 --> 00:20:32.698
Excuse me.

00:20:34.033 --> 00:20:36.706
Hey, wait! Hey!

00:20:36.806 --> 00:20:38.877
It's me, Takemura!

00:20:43.185 --> 00:20:45.189
<i>[Kai] He didn't notice?</i>

00:20:45.289 --> 00:20:47.594
<i>The hell?</i>

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:50.967
<i>He actually forgot that</i>
<i>he used to bully me...</i>

00:20:51.067 --> 00:20:53.640
<i>Was I really that</i>
<i>insignificant?</i>

00:20:54.508 --> 00:20:56.378
<i>You gotta be kidding me.</i>

00:21:09.037 --> 00:21:13.011
<i>I wasted a year of my</i>
<i>life waiting for this?</i>

00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:18.723
<i>[Mei] Even if you beat them,</i>
<i>it's not gonna change anything.</i>

00:21:38.295 --> 00:21:39.832
[Yamato] Kai...

00:21:39.932 --> 00:21:42.838
Hey. You here to meet
your girlfriend?

00:21:44.007 --> 00:21:45.342
Yeah.

00:21:46.144 --> 00:21:48.616
Mei Tachibana, from the bakery.

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:49.852
Yeah.

00:21:52.123 --> 00:21:53.458
Yanno...

00:21:54.562 --> 00:21:56.732
I think... I probably...

00:21:57.534 --> 00:21:59.404
Like that girlfriend of yours.

00:23:29.818 --> 00:23:34.093
Behind closed doors with
Yamato, I was so nervous.

00:23:34.193 --> 00:23:38.168
I'm kind of relieved and
disappointed that my mom
came home when she did.

00:23:38.268 --> 00:23:42.511
Honored Mother, you came home
at just the right time to save
Mei and her precious honor!

00:23:42.611 --> 00:23:44.748
Good job, meow!
