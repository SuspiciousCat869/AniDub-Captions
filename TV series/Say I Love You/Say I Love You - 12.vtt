[Yamato] Mei, take
her home for me, okay?

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.195
[Megumi] Sweet.

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:15.632
Salty.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:19.138
Sweet.

00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:23.246
Spicy.

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.277
[Momoko] Megu, good morning.

00:02:02.378 --> 00:02:06.119
I brought you those mustard
leaf rice balls you like.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:15.370
[Yamato] Sasano!
[Momoko] Kurosawa-kun.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.913
Where's Kitagawa? The magazine
called and said they can't
get in touch with her.

00:02:20.013 --> 00:02:23.621
Yeah. I've been trying to
get her to come to the door.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.225
What should I do?

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.605
[Doorbell rings]

[Yamato] Kitagawa!

00:02:36.479 --> 00:02:38.584
Are you in there, Kitagawa?

00:02:38.684 --> 00:02:39.720
Yamato-kun?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.790
[Momoko] Megu!

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.159
Did something happen to you?

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:44.629
You can talk to me if you wa-

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:45.631
[Megumi] Go away.

00:02:45.732 --> 00:02:46.667
Megu, open the door!

00:02:46.767 --> 00:02:47.836
[Megumi] No!

00:02:47.936 --> 00:02:49.639
Who asked you to come here?

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.142
I'm not going back!

00:02:51.242 --> 00:02:52.444
[Momoko] Megu...

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:55.618
[Megumi] No one
needs me! Nobody!

00:02:55.718 --> 00:02:59.191
[Momoko] Why would you say that?
[Megumi] You don't
need me either!

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:03.501
[Megumi] Don't pretend to be my
friend when you don't really
give a damn about me!

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:06.673
Megu...

00:03:06.774 --> 00:03:10.815
[Megumi] I've had it up to
here with people using me
and laughing at me.

00:03:10.915 --> 00:03:13.921
Pretending to be my friends
when it's convenient.

00:03:14.021 --> 00:03:15.691
You'll all run out
on me in the end.

00:03:15.792 --> 00:03:18.063
And if that's the case,
I don't want friends!

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.398
I don't need them!

00:03:23.139 --> 00:03:26.312
Get out of here! Leave me alone!

00:03:28.818 --> 00:03:31.122
Kitagawa.

00:03:31.222 --> 00:03:35.665
I know a girl just like you.
And she used to say that
she wanted to be alone.

00:03:35.765 --> 00:03:38.069
That people are quick
to betray you.

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:40.641
That she didn't need friends.

00:03:40.742 --> 00:03:43.981
[Megumi] She's right.
All they do is hurt you.

00:03:44.081 --> 00:03:46.553
[Yamato] Not everyone
is like that!

00:03:46.653 --> 00:03:49.358
There are people outside this
door who want to help you!

00:03:49.458 --> 00:03:51.563
We're really thinking
about you, Kitagawa!

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:54.335
All you have to do
is open your eyes!

00:03:54.435 --> 00:03:57.174
Staying in your room
won't change anything.

00:03:57.274 --> 00:03:59.211
We won't be able
to help you either.

00:03:59.311 --> 00:04:03.554
All you'll end up doing
is betraying the people
who are worried about you.

00:04:05.625 --> 00:04:07.896
[Momoko] Megu, I'm sorry.

00:04:07.996 --> 00:04:11.703
I left you alone because
I was thinking of myself.

00:04:11.804 --> 00:04:13.273
I'm sorry.

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:15.545
What in the hell
are you sorry about?

00:04:15.645 --> 00:04:19.686
I don't know why you're
hurting, Megumi, and
maybe I'll never know.

00:04:19.786 --> 00:04:23.627
And I might not be able
to understand if you
told me about it,

00:04:23.727 --> 00:04:26.199
but still, I want
to know what's up.

00:04:26.299 --> 00:04:28.069
Your mother's worried too, Megu.

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:31.577
Tell me! Yell at me,
complain at me!

00:04:33.781 --> 00:04:37.922
[Megumi] Nobody every
appreciated a damn thing
I did to make them happy.

00:04:38.022 --> 00:04:41.530
I can't try hard enough.
I'll never be good enough.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.803
Because they'll never be
satisfied and I'm sick of it!

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.407
I don't want to be an icon
for those people anymore!

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:49.613
Who gives a damn about that?!

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.525
It doesn't matter what
anyone thinks, Megu!

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.363
You've been working on your
looks since we were kids.

00:04:58.463 --> 00:05:02.070
You became a model and people
stopped calling you ugly.

00:05:02.171 --> 00:05:04.441
Isn't that what this
is really all about?

00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:08.918
You can't give up on yourself
just because a few people
don't understand you.

00:05:09.018 --> 00:05:10.655
I knew you were always cool.

00:05:10.755 --> 00:05:14.663
You beat a lot of negativity
to become Megu-tan, I know.

00:05:14.763 --> 00:05:18.469
I remember what they said
back then, and it still
doesn't matter.

00:05:18.571 --> 00:05:23.547
You were cooler than anyone else
then, and you're still cooler
than they are now.

00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:27.054
[Kid Momoko] It must
be nice to be tall.

00:05:27.154 --> 00:05:29.793
[Kid Megumi] I'm in the back
because I'm the ugliest...

00:05:29.893 --> 00:05:32.097
[Kid Momoko] Don't pay
any attention to them.

00:05:34.836 --> 00:05:37.040
See? You're cute.

00:05:41.015 --> 00:05:43.821
You should be more confident
in yourself, Megu.

<i>[Megumi] You were</i>

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.777
Yeah.

00:07:03.413 --> 00:07:04.950
What a relief.

Look. She didn't do
anything to you.

just ganging up on her.

things to you like this.

I haven't been acting
like the real me, Asami.

I was just being nice to
you when I felt like I was
getting something from you.

[Asami] I know...

You've always taken
me out to have fun.

Megumi-chan, it's okay because
all those you did still made me

think it was kind.

I'm sorry, but I don't
hate you, Megumi-chan!

it, but I've had worse.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:39.151
It's from Asami-san.

00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:43.426
"Everyone, wanna go to
the festival today?"

00:12:43.527 --> 00:12:45.965
The traffic island at 3pm?!

00:12:49.271 --> 00:12:50.406
Mei!

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.279
Mei-chan!

00:12:53.379 --> 00:12:54.682
You're late!

00:12:54.782 --> 00:12:56.586
[Mei] Sorry, I had to work.

00:12:56.686 --> 00:12:57.888
Sorry for the short notice,

00:12:57.989 --> 00:12:58.957
but I wanted to get everyone

00:12:59.057 --> 00:13:00.426
out here and start early.

00:13:00.527 --> 00:13:01.763
I'm happy you asked me.

00:13:01.863 --> 00:13:04.067
[Asami] Awesome, Mei-chan!

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:05.738
Where are Kai and Kitagawa?

00:13:05.838 --> 00:13:07.040
They said they're busy.

00:13:07.140 --> 00:13:08.476
You and your short notices

00:13:08.577 --> 00:13:09.779
are gonna be the death of me.

00:13:09.879 --> 00:13:12.952
You're excited to be
here. Don't pick on her.

00:13:13.987 --> 00:13:15.390
Don't hit me either!

00:13:15.490 --> 00:13:17.093
You're so cool, Aiko-chan.

00:13:17.193 --> 00:13:19.431
[Asami and Masashi laugh]
[Yamato] Right, let's go.

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.536
[Nakanishi] Alright, let's go!
[Asami] I'm going
to eat so much.

00:13:26.913 --> 00:13:28.416
Oh wow, candied apples!

00:13:28.517 --> 00:13:30.754
Let's get some chocolate
bananas, Asamicchi.

00:13:30.854 --> 00:13:32.725
What? Why?

00:13:32.825 --> 00:13:34.461
Everything looks good.

00:13:34.562 --> 00:13:36.298
Mei, where should we start?

00:13:38.469 --> 00:13:40.073
I kinda wish...

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:42.945
I had a yukata, too.

00:13:49.458 --> 00:13:52.998
Mei, the outfit you have on is
cute, but you're always cute.

00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:59.946
[Asami] Aaah! You shouldn't be
doing that in front of everyone!

00:14:00.046 --> 00:14:01.115
No, it's not...!

00:14:01.215 --> 00:14:03.520
Oh, don't mind the
two of us, Asami.

00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.125
[Asami] What? What?! Seriously.
I'm looking right at you.

00:14:06.225 --> 00:14:07.995
[Aiko] Jeez you two, it's hot
enough out here already.

00:14:08.095 --> 00:14:10.066
[Yamato] Mei, what
do you want to eat?

00:14:12.705 --> 00:14:14.174
[Mei] Gohei mochi.

00:14:41.128 --> 00:14:42.832
[Game Operator] Sorry about
that.

00:14:42.932 --> 00:14:44.936
[Mei] I've got a
cat at home, so...

00:14:45.036 --> 00:14:47.575
[Aiko] We had fun catching
them, so it's fine.

00:14:47.675 --> 00:14:48.643
[Game Operator] Thank you.

00:14:48.744 --> 00:14:50.614
[Asami gasp] American hot dogs!

00:14:50.714 --> 00:14:52.918
[Nakanishi] Asamicchi, wait!

00:14:53.018 --> 00:14:54.989
She's eating more?

00:14:56.024 --> 00:14:57.060
Are you okay?

00:14:57.160 --> 00:14:59.397
You ate too much, Asamicchi.

00:14:59.498 --> 00:15:01.836
[Masashi] Maybe you should go
home and rest for a little bit.

00:15:01.936 --> 00:15:04.274
Yeah. Can you walk?

00:15:04.374 --> 00:15:05.911
[Asami] Mm-mm.

00:15:06.011 --> 00:15:07.982
[Nakanishi] Sorry about that.
[Asami] Sorry...

00:15:08.082 --> 00:15:09.685
What do you think
we should do next?

00:15:09.786 --> 00:15:11.054
Wait for the fireworks display?

00:15:11.155 --> 00:15:12.892
That's still a long time off.

00:15:12.992 --> 00:15:15.964
I'm headed back home.
My feet are killing me.

00:15:16.064 --> 00:15:17.434
Want me to carry you there?

00:15:17.535 --> 00:15:19.237
[Aiko] That's not cool.
[Masahi laughs goofily]

00:15:19.337 --> 00:15:23.078
Then, I guess we're going
our separate ways.

00:15:23.179 --> 00:15:25.016
[Masahi] Yeah.
[Nakanishi] Let's take
breaks on our way home.

00:15:25.116 --> 00:15:26.586
[Asami] Okay...
[Aiko] Don't push
yourself too hard.

00:15:26.686 --> 00:15:28.189
[Masashi] Later!

00:15:36.305 --> 00:15:37.440
I'm home.

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:40.848
Mei, where in the
world have you been?

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.718
I've been trying to call you.

00:15:42.818 --> 00:15:44.655
[Mei] You called? Oh, sorry.

00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:47.761
[Ms. Tachibana] I rushed all
the way home, so I could
help you put it on.

00:15:47.862 --> 00:15:48.697
Huh?

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.199
My yukata, silly!

00:15:50.299 --> 00:15:52.137
I thought you were going
to the summer festival,

00:15:52.237 --> 00:15:53.439
so I got it out for you.

00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:54.709
Come on, hurry up.

00:15:56.445 --> 00:16:01.321
[Mei] It's fine.
I already went, mom.

00:16:01.421 --> 00:16:05.263
Sorry. You went through all this
trouble getting it ready...

00:16:10.473 --> 00:16:12.678
You should go again.

00:16:12.778 --> 00:16:15.249
You're not by
yourself this year.

00:16:15.349 --> 00:16:17.755
You're dating Yamato-kun,
aren't you?

00:16:17.855 --> 00:16:19.191
[Mei] I told you. I already-

00:16:19.291 --> 00:16:20.961
[Ms. Tachibana] You're going to
go back.

00:16:21.061 --> 00:16:22.565
But definitely not like that.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:25.504
You'll go there wearing a
yukata and traditional makeup.

00:16:25.604 --> 00:16:27.508
But...

00:16:27.608 --> 00:16:31.516
[Ms. Tachibana] It's times like
these that you need to be a
girl, sweetheart.

00:16:31.616 --> 00:16:34.454
The important thing is
doing everything you can

00:16:34.555 --> 00:16:37.060
for the person you love
on a day like this,

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.130
like I'm gonna do for you.

00:16:39.999 --> 00:16:41.468
You may not understand it now,

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:45.243
but by the end of the night,
it'll make a lot more sense.

00:16:47.615 --> 00:16:50.286
Come on, Mei.

00:16:50.386 --> 00:16:53.827
[Announcer] The fireworks
display will begin shortly.

00:16:53.927 --> 00:16:57.601
The fireworks display
will begin shortly.

00:17:10.761 --> 00:17:13.098
[Crowd exclaiming in awe]

00:17:47.968 --> 00:17:49.471
[Cellphone goes off]
[Yamato] Hm?

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:56.485
[Mei] See you later!

00:18:19.799 --> 00:18:21.636
[Megumi] Bleh.
[Kai] Bleh?

00:18:21.736 --> 00:18:22.871
What about the festival?

00:18:22.972 --> 00:18:24.942
Meeting people is
such a hassle, and...

00:18:25.042 --> 00:18:28.115
I'm still figuring out
why I've gone out with
you in the first place.

00:18:28.215 --> 00:18:30.219
That's harsh.

00:18:37.868 --> 00:18:39.437
It's beautiful.

00:18:45.717 --> 00:18:46.819
Yeah.

00:18:48.723 --> 00:18:50.961
[Megumi] Why AM I spending
time with you?

00:18:51.061 --> 00:18:52.397
[Kai] What?!

00:19:16.078 --> 00:19:17.380
<i>[Mei] It's so hot.</i>

00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:19.652
<i>The fireworks are ending!</i>

00:19:19.752 --> 00:19:24.361
<i>My hair's a mess, and my</i>
<i>makeup is all over the place!</i>

00:19:29.772 --> 00:19:31.909
[Crowd cheers]

00:19:33.747 --> 00:19:36.318
[Announcer] The fireworks
display has ended.

00:19:36.418 --> 00:19:38.355
Thank you very much.

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:48.242
<i>[Mei] I didn't make it in time.</i>

00:19:56.491 --> 00:19:58.696
<i>Why am I thinking about this?</i>

00:20:01.034 --> 00:20:04.007
<i>Dad, Mom.</i>

00:20:04.107 --> 00:20:06.546
<i>They were so kind</i>
<i>and loving to me.</i>

00:20:06.646 --> 00:20:09.484
<i>Even if something bad</i>
<i>happened at school,</i>

00:20:09.585 --> 00:20:13.358
<i>I felt like they were saying,</i>
<i>"I'll protect you."</i>

00:20:14.929 --> 00:20:17.266
[Mei breathing heavily]

00:20:18.035 --> 00:20:19.505
[Mei] Yamato!

00:20:26.986 --> 00:20:32.664
I'm... I'm sorry... for having
you come back out here.

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:34.902
I'm sorry!

00:20:37.306 --> 00:20:38.743
Yamato?

00:20:38.843 --> 00:20:44.387
Oh, s-sorry. It's just
that uh... You're so cute.

00:20:46.291 --> 00:20:49.932
My mother got a
yukata out for me.

00:20:50.032 --> 00:20:51.569
She helped me put it on.

00:20:51.669 --> 00:20:55.944
The fireworks are over, but I
really wanted you to see me.

00:20:58.482 --> 00:21:03.392
Sorry... for inviting you
out for something so stupid.

00:21:25.369 --> 00:21:28.676
[Yamato] It's definitely
not stupid. And you...

00:21:28.776 --> 00:21:29.912
are amazing.

00:21:43.338 --> 00:21:45.710
<i>[Mei] Going forward</i>
<i>from here...</i>

00:21:45.811 --> 00:21:48.015
<i>[Yamato] No matter</i>
<i>what happens...</i>

00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:32.456
Everything that begins
must also end.

00:23:32.557 --> 00:23:35.062
The seasons change,
and time flows calmly.

00:23:35.162 --> 00:23:36.966
[Cellphone goes off]
[Mei] Oh! It's from Yamato.

00:23:37.066 --> 00:23:40.406
What's this? "I caught
a cold. Achoo. (Cry)."

00:23:40.507 --> 00:23:41.776
Yamato, are you okay?

00:23:41.876 --> 00:23:43.245
[Marshmallow] It looks
like there's a little more

00:23:43.345 --> 00:23:44.882
trouble ahead, meow.
