WEBVTT

00:00:18.838 --> 00:00:20.708
[Yamato] Getting ready
for the storm?

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.327
Man. This little guy
really likes you, Mei.

00:00:30.427 --> 00:00:32.933
I didn't think anyone
saw me out here, yanno,

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.237
this part of the courtyard
being so far away.

00:00:35.337 --> 00:00:37.341
Well, I saw you just fine.

00:00:43.854 --> 00:00:46.660
Your hair seems a little
frizzier than usual today.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.000
It must be the rain.
I should get it cut soon.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.604
Can I go with you?!

00:00:51.704 --> 00:00:54.041
Oh? Huh?

00:00:58.517 --> 00:01:02.792
<i>Today I, Mei Tachibana,</i>
<i>am quite flustered.</i>

00:01:02.892 --> 00:01:06.934
<i>I'm about to go out with a boy</i>
<i>for the very first time...</i>

00:01:07.034 --> 00:01:09.640
<i>in my life. Oh my god.</i>

00:02:52.812 --> 00:02:54.382
Late, Tachibana?

00:02:54.482 --> 00:02:55.918
That's not a good way to start.

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:58.524
It takes a lot of nerve to run
twenty minutes late for our

00:02:58.624 --> 00:03:00.795
first date without
calling me, yanno.

00:03:02.297 --> 00:03:04.268
Whatever.

00:03:04.368 --> 00:03:07.074
We're going to the
salon, not dating.

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:09.946
Of course this is a date.

00:03:10.047 --> 00:03:15.190
<i>[Mei] Honestly, it's not</i>
<i>that I don't want to go</i>
<i>on a date with him...</i>

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.065
<i>I actually did worry</i>
<i>about what to wear...</i>

00:03:19.165 --> 00:03:21.770
This? Or maybe this...

00:03:23.406 --> 00:03:26.780
No, I don't want to go out
there looking too dressed up.

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.517
Where are you off to?

00:03:28.617 --> 00:03:30.688
[Mei] Uh, the salon.
[Ms. Tachibana] My goodness.

00:03:30.788 --> 00:03:34.295
Why would you get all dressed up
for something like a haircut?

00:03:34.395 --> 00:03:36.867
Now wait a minute! Mei-chan!

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:38.369
You've got a date!

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.144
No, I'm just going to the
salon. Stop dancing like that!

00:03:42.244 --> 00:03:43.814
You go girl!

00:03:45.317 --> 00:03:49.258
But, it's... I said
it's not really... Mom!

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.501
<i>I swore to myself that</i>
<i>this isn't a date,</i>

00:03:53.601 --> 00:03:56.740
<i>which is why when</i>
<i>I chose my outfit,</i>

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.311
<i>I ended up with this.</i>

00:03:59.412 --> 00:04:01.784
Look at that. We're
even dressed alike.

00:04:01.884 --> 00:04:05.323
Looks like we have the
same taste in clothes.
That's pretty cool.

00:04:06.894 --> 00:04:11.904
Oh, hey! Nakanishi just
told me that he and Asami
just started going out.

00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:13.574
Oh. I'm glad.

00:04:13.674 --> 00:04:15.177
He said it was thanks to you.

00:04:15.277 --> 00:04:17.347
I didn't do anything really.

00:04:17.448 --> 00:04:19.719
[Yamato] Nakanishi
called you amazing.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.122
You know something?

00:04:21.222 --> 00:04:24.028
I'm happy for him. Now.

00:04:24.128 --> 00:04:26.165
We need to get to the salon.

00:04:26.265 --> 00:04:28.136
Now? We can go later.

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:30.173
Unless you have an appointment?

00:04:30.273 --> 00:04:31.409
I don't, but...

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.246
Then let's have some fun first.

00:04:33.346 --> 00:04:35.785
We can go to the
salon later, 'kay?

00:04:35.885 --> 00:04:37.321
Yeah, sure.

00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.691
[Yamato] Where should we go?

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:40.460
A movie? Karaoke?

00:04:40.561 --> 00:04:42.699
N-Nowhere behind closed
doors, got it?!

00:04:42.799 --> 00:04:45.036
[Yamato] Why not?
[Mei] Well, because...

00:04:48.042 --> 00:04:49.646
Ha, don't worry about that.

00:04:49.746 --> 00:04:52.151
I won't do anything
besides kiss you anyway.

00:04:52.251 --> 00:04:53.319
[Mei] Say what?!

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.691
[Girl 1] Hey, that
guy is super hot!

00:04:55.791 --> 00:04:58.062
[Girl 2] Totally hot!
I bet he's a model.

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:00.668
[Girl 1] Should we talk to him?
[Girl 2] He's with a girl.

00:05:00.768 --> 00:05:02.505
[Girl 1] There's no way
she's his girlfriend.

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:05.878
[Girl 2] Well, let's
try talking to him then!

00:05:05.978 --> 00:05:08.951
[Talent Scout] Excuse me,
do you have a moment?

00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.124
Sorry to spring this on
you, but I work for a
talent agency and I was-

00:05:12.224 --> 00:05:16.567
[Yamato] I'm not interested
in that kind of thing. Sorry.

00:05:20.675 --> 00:05:21.844
[Girl 3] Check him out.

00:05:21.944 --> 00:05:26.485
[Girl 4] He's so handsome.

00:05:26.587 --> 00:05:28.289
Mei, is something wrong?

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:32.932
No, I was just wondering if
this is the way people
always act around you.

00:05:33.032 --> 00:05:33.901
Huh?

00:05:34.001 --> 00:05:35.470
[Mei] Getting scouted...

00:05:35.571 --> 00:05:38.142
Girls just walking
up to you like that.

00:05:38.243 --> 00:05:42.451
Uuuh... The talent scout?
That was the first time
I ever spoke to one.

00:05:42.552 --> 00:05:43.854
The girls come onto
me quite a bit.

00:05:43.954 --> 00:05:46.492
Are you sure you want me
hanging around with you?

00:05:46.593 --> 00:05:48.964
It must be embarrassing
to be seen with me.

00:05:52.772 --> 00:05:55.778
Mei-san, do I look
that shallow to you?

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.890
I really don't know
what to think. It's a
lot for me to take in.

00:06:02.357 --> 00:06:04.028
I see.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:08.871
Let's act more like
a couple, okay?

00:06:08.971 --> 00:06:12.779
I mean, we're on a date, and we
don't need anymore distractions.

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:17.522
[Mei] But we haven't
started dating...

00:06:17.622 --> 00:06:19.024
[Yamato] Sure we have.

00:06:20.193 --> 00:06:22.130
You're my girlfriend now.

00:06:25.136 --> 00:06:30.815
<i>[Mei] I thought holding</i>
<i>someone's hand wasn't as</i>
<i>big a deal as kissing, but...</i>

00:06:30.915 --> 00:06:36.325
<i>As our hands touched,</i>
<i>I could feel his warmth</i>
<i>in a different way,</i>

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:39.933
<i>but it made my heart</i>
<i>pound just as hard.</i>

00:06:40.033 --> 00:06:44.809
<i>I really didn't know another</i>
<i>person's touch could be so</i>
<i>warm, and comforting.</i>

00:06:45.578 --> 00:06:46.947
<i>It was nice.</i>

00:06:50.253 --> 00:06:52.024
[Masashi] Yamato!

00:06:55.865 --> 00:06:57.067
It is you.

00:06:59.071 --> 00:07:00.407
You're with Tachibana?

00:07:00.508 --> 00:07:02.545
[Yamato] Hey, Masashi.
Aiko-chan.

00:07:02.645 --> 00:07:05.317
You guys make an odd
couple, you know that?

00:07:05.417 --> 00:07:07.555
[Yamato] First date.

00:07:08.056 --> 00:07:08.624
No way?!

00:07:08.724 --> 00:07:10.160
Well uh, we just...

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.565
Me and Aiko we're about to
head to the bowling alley.

00:07:12.665 --> 00:07:14.703
You wanna come with?

00:07:14.803 --> 00:07:17.542
[Yamato] Should we?
[Mei] I really need to
get my hair cut.

00:07:17.642 --> 00:07:21.382
[Aiko] Come with us.
We have extra coupons.

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.954
It'll be a lot more
fun with four.

00:07:25.524 --> 00:07:26.927
Alright.

00:07:27.027 --> 00:07:27.996
[Yamato] You sure?

00:07:28.096 --> 00:07:29.498
[Mei] Yeah.

00:07:33.272 --> 00:07:37.381
[Masashi] The teams are
gonna be me and Aiko against
Yamato and Tachibana!

00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:39.151
You're on!

00:07:39.251 --> 00:07:45.130
<i>[Aiko] Why the hell would</i>
<i>Yamato choose someone</i>
<i>like Tachibana?</i>

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.735
<i>What's so good about her?</i>

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.943
Pins. Your days are numbered.

00:07:56.820 --> 00:07:57.655
You suck.

00:07:57.755 --> 00:08:00.393
[Yamato laughs] You're up, Mei.

00:08:00.493 --> 00:08:02.397
[Mei] O-okay.

00:08:02.497 --> 00:08:05.236
[Yamato] I got your back,
so just do your best.

00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.713
This is the first time I've
seen Tachibana even move.

00:08:09.813 --> 00:08:12.150
I bet she's lousy at sports.

00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:26.780
[Aiko] A-A strike?!

00:08:27.749 --> 00:08:29.519
[Yamato] That was awesome, Mei!

00:08:29.619 --> 00:08:30.588
[Masashi] Who are you?!

00:08:30.688 --> 00:08:32.558
[Yamato] You're good at bowling?

00:08:32.658 --> 00:08:36.265
I bowled a little once in a
while when I was younger.

00:08:36.365 --> 00:08:39.104
Is that what you
see... Kurosawa?

00:08:42.612 --> 00:08:45.383
[Yamato] That's awesome!
Incredible!

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.688
Three strikes in a row!

00:08:48.122 --> 00:08:49.124
I was lucky.

00:08:49.224 --> 00:08:51.162
No one gets lucky three times!

00:08:51.262 --> 00:08:54.435
[Yamato] Now punch it in!
[Masashi] Aiko, I think you and
I are gonna lose real bad.

00:08:54.536 --> 00:08:56.205
Yeah!

00:08:56.305 --> 00:09:00.080
<i>[Aiko] What the hell?</i>
<i>Yamato looks like he's</i>
<i>really having fun.</i>

00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:03.721
The boy looks smitten...
with Tachibana no less.

00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:07.595
But I'm head over
heels for you, Aiko!

00:09:07.695 --> 00:09:09.899
[Aiko] Hearing that does
not make me happy.

00:09:09.999 --> 00:09:11.135
Ack!

00:09:12.204 --> 00:09:13.907
[Aiko] This is annoying.

00:09:18.216 --> 00:09:19.819
Tachibana.

00:09:20.588 --> 00:09:22.324
Let's hit the soda machine.

00:09:24.896 --> 00:09:28.469
So tell me, did you call
Yamato or did he call you?

00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.572
Why are you guys out today?

00:09:29.672 --> 00:09:31.777
I didn't ask him.

00:09:31.877 --> 00:09:34.649
When I told him I needed
to go the salon today,

00:09:34.749 --> 00:09:37.087
he just kind of invited
himself along, yanno.

00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:38.590
He invited himself?

00:09:38.690 --> 00:09:40.728
Aren't you guys already
dating or something?

00:09:40.828 --> 00:09:44.201
Kurosawa-kun is trying to
tell me that we are, but...

00:09:44.301 --> 00:09:47.073
I don't know what it means
to dating someone yet.

00:09:47.174 --> 00:09:48.844
It's so new to me.

00:09:50.013 --> 00:09:53.954
Okay, Tachibana. Do you
like Yamato, or don't you?

00:09:56.091 --> 00:09:57.060
I guess.

00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:58.764
[Aiko] You guess, huh?

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:02.839
Let me tell you something.
There are girls that would
kill to be in your place.

00:10:02.939 --> 00:10:06.412
There are girls that would just
love to hang around with Yamato.

00:10:06.513 --> 00:10:12.057
He's fawning all over you and
you're guessing and trying
to make up your mind?

00:10:12.157 --> 00:10:14.361
So answer me this.

00:10:14.461 --> 00:10:18.136
Why would he choose
you over someone he's
already had sex with?

00:10:21.041 --> 00:10:24.983
So, if you're not sure about
him, stop wasting his time.

00:10:30.895 --> 00:10:32.130
[Yamato] Where's Mei?

00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.399
[Aiko] No clue.

00:10:34.268 --> 00:10:36.138
Uh, Mei!

00:10:36.238 --> 00:10:37.875
You're up next, okay?

00:10:41.583 --> 00:10:43.152
[Yamato] Get us
another strike, Mei!

00:10:52.304 --> 00:10:53.406
Mei?

00:11:00.888 --> 00:11:02.725
[Mei] I'm going home.

00:11:06.332 --> 00:11:08.236
Hey! Mei!

00:11:08.336 --> 00:11:12.010
Let her go. Stay and hang out
with me and Masashi, okay?

00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:15.216
Look, Aiko. I'm with
Mei today, alright?

00:11:15.316 --> 00:11:16.418
Sorry.

00:11:18.456 --> 00:11:19.859
Mei!

00:11:36.693 --> 00:11:38.162
Mei!

00:11:44.976 --> 00:11:49.117
So, Aiko-chan. If you're
not angry anymore...

00:11:49.218 --> 00:11:51.388
I'm gettin' kind of
hungry over here.

00:11:51.488 --> 00:11:52.658
Really not up for it.

00:11:52.758 --> 00:11:54.294
I know you still
like him and all,

00:11:54.394 --> 00:11:55.564
but you've got me.

00:11:55.664 --> 00:11:57.000
No way. I'm not letting that

00:11:57.100 --> 00:11:59.371
mousey little thing beat me.

00:11:59.471 --> 00:12:01.475
You're talking about Tachibana?

00:12:01.576 --> 00:12:06.285
<i>[Aiko] What's so good about</i>
<i>that ugly, loudmouthed bitch</i>
<i>who didn't even try?</i>

00:12:06.385 --> 00:12:10.928
<i>I'd do anything for the</i>
<i>man that I love. Anything.</i>

00:12:12.698 --> 00:12:15.403
[Girl 1] Aiko, are you ready?

00:12:15.504 --> 00:12:18.543
Sorry, I have a
date with my guy.

00:12:18.644 --> 00:12:19.478
[Girl 2] Oh?

00:12:19.579 --> 00:12:21.015
Lucky.

00:12:21.115 --> 00:12:23.052
[Girl 1] So introduce
him to us next time.

00:12:23.152 --> 00:12:25.658
<i>[Aiko] With my last boyfriend,</i>

00:12:25.758 --> 00:12:31.201
<i>I devoted my time and money to</i>
<i>become the girl of his dreams.</i>

00:12:31.302 --> 00:12:35.577
<i>I bought all the makeup</i>
<i>and pills I could to</i>
<i>improve my looks.</i>

00:12:35.678 --> 00:12:41.455
<i>But the harder I tried,</i>
<i>the more I realized</i>
<i>it'd never be enough.</i>

00:12:41.556 --> 00:12:43.292
<i>In my pursuit of a quick fix,</i>

00:12:43.392 --> 00:12:46.065
<i>I ruined my skin.</i>

00:12:56.151 --> 00:12:59.559
[Yamato] You don't need
all that make-up, Aiko.

00:12:59.659 --> 00:13:03.165
You sure are putting in
a lot of work for that
boyfriend of yours.

00:13:06.438 --> 00:13:11.783
<i>[Aiko] It was the first time in</i>
<i>my life someone complimented</i>
<i>my natural looks.</i>

00:13:11.883 --> 00:13:15.858
<i>Yamato saw me for</i>
<i>who I really was.</i>

00:13:15.958 --> 00:13:19.297
<i>I liked it. That's why...</i>

00:13:25.009 --> 00:13:27.447
<i>When I found out my boyfriend</i>
<i>had cheated on me...</i>

00:13:28.416 --> 00:13:30.019
Yamato!

00:13:33.259 --> 00:13:36.065
I can't take it anymore!
I want to die!

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:38.169
I tried so hard, but...

00:13:38.269 --> 00:13:41.609
I'll never be as cute as
other girls! I look stupid!

00:13:41.710 --> 00:13:42.812
How can you say that?

00:13:42.912 --> 00:13:44.716
Then have sex with me!

00:13:44.816 --> 00:13:46.452
Please, Yamato!

00:13:56.940 --> 00:14:00.480
<i>I took advantage of</i>
<i>Yamato's kindness.</i>

00:14:06.993 --> 00:14:09.431
<i>I lost weight for Yamato.</i>

00:14:09.532 --> 00:14:12.972
<i>44 pounds in two months.</i>

00:14:14.575 --> 00:14:18.249
<i>I just wanted to be beautiful.</i>

00:14:18.349 --> 00:14:21.288
<i>And I will not accept that he</i>
<i>would be with someone who wants</i>

00:14:21.388 --> 00:14:25.998
<i>to pussyfoot around him and</i>
<i>not put in the work it takes.</i>

00:15:12.725 --> 00:15:14.662
I thought I'd find you here.

00:15:30.694 --> 00:15:32.832
Did Aiko say something to you?

00:15:32.932 --> 00:15:36.673
Why would he choose
you over someone he's
already had sex with?

00:15:38.543 --> 00:15:42.317
[Mei] I don't understand
you, Kurosawa-kun.

00:15:43.854 --> 00:15:45.958
We're just too different.

00:15:48.797 --> 00:15:50.333
[Yamato] That's not true.

00:15:53.807 --> 00:15:55.944
[Mei] He likes you.

00:15:56.044 --> 00:15:58.249
He got scared and ran
away a couple of times,

00:15:58.349 --> 00:16:02.157
but after a couple visits,
he finally warmed up to me.

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:11.475
Mei-san. Can I show
you something?

00:16:23.767 --> 00:16:25.604
[Yamato] And we're here!

00:16:25.704 --> 00:16:27.240
[Mei] What is this place?

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:29.044
[Yamato] My middle school.

00:16:29.645 --> 00:16:31.281
Takes me back!

00:17:01.108 --> 00:17:04.314
I put a hole in this
wall, with my fist.

00:17:04.414 --> 00:17:08.055
I guess you could say
I was pretty wild.

00:17:09.324 --> 00:17:13.767
Back in the day, I really
wasn't that nice. It bugs me.

00:17:22.317 --> 00:17:26.626
My class at school was full
of fighting and bullying.

00:17:26.726 --> 00:17:32.337
Worried that I might end
up a target, I kept a close
eye on everyone around me.

00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:35.142
Making sure I wasn't the
next guy to get hit.

00:17:36.646 --> 00:17:38.984
I was like a chameleon.

00:17:39.084 --> 00:17:42.190
I did my best to blend
in with my surroundings,

00:17:42.290 --> 00:17:44.695
doing and saying what
I needed to stay safe.

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:52.477
One day, my best friend became
the bullies' next target.

00:17:52.578 --> 00:17:56.418
Around the other kids, I ignored
him like everyone else.

00:17:56.519 --> 00:17:59.625
Secretly, though,
we'd meet up to talk.

00:17:59.725 --> 00:18:03.098
I had some nerve acting
like a real friend to him.

00:18:03.198 --> 00:18:11.248
Even then, one day he came to
me, with his face covered in
bruises and he said,

00:18:11.348 --> 00:18:14.822
"I wanted to thank you for
talking to me, Kurosawa-kun."

00:18:15.757 --> 00:18:20.166
But the next day, he
transferred schools.

00:18:20.266 --> 00:18:23.740
I never really did anything
that truly helped him.

00:18:24.742 --> 00:18:25.844
Damn!

00:18:26.746 --> 00:18:28.850
Damn! Damn!

00:18:30.052 --> 00:18:31.756
Damn it!

00:18:37.768 --> 00:18:40.874
I never felt so useless.

00:18:42.243 --> 00:18:46.318
Mei, I know you think
we're worlds apart,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.823
but the truth is I...

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:51.428
The truth is...

00:18:52.230 --> 00:18:54.034
Even now in high school,

00:18:54.134 --> 00:18:57.675
I'm still blending
in with the crowd.

00:18:57.775 --> 00:19:00.212
I'm still no good to anyone.

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:04.655
It isn't that at all.
From what I've seen,

00:19:04.755 --> 00:19:07.528
people seem to be naturally
attracted to you, you know.

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:09.598
[Yamato] Sure, to my looks.
[Mei] Oh, come on!

00:19:09.699 --> 00:19:12.905
[Mei] You just can't get a
friendship with your looks.

00:19:13.005 --> 00:19:15.677
There's faith, and
trust, and work too.

00:19:17.146 --> 00:19:20.386
So now you're telling
me to trust people?

00:19:20.486 --> 00:19:23.960
Because you taught me to
think that way, Kurosawa-kun.

00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:26.398
I never thought I'd
say this, but...

00:19:26.498 --> 00:19:33.513
Little by little, bit by bit,
I want to start trusting people.

00:19:33.613 --> 00:19:36.351
Know what I think?
You're pretty strong.

00:19:36.451 --> 00:19:38.923
And because of that, people
don't push you around.

00:19:39.725 --> 00:19:41.261
I really like that.

00:19:41.996 --> 00:19:44.769
Mei, I...

00:19:50.379 --> 00:19:54.154
I fell in love with you
the moment you kicked me.

00:19:54.254 --> 00:19:56.859
I bet I seem a lot
less cool now.

00:19:58.630 --> 00:20:01.401
You've shown me your
vulnerability, Kurosawa-kun.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:03.640
To someone like me, that's cool.

00:20:08.683 --> 00:20:10.520
You know Mei,

00:20:10.620 --> 00:20:12.958
this might not be the
right time, but...

00:20:21.876 --> 00:20:23.378
Can I kiss you?

00:20:27.855 --> 00:20:29.390
[Mei] Sure.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.897
<i>[Mei] I know it</i>
<i>seems strange...</i>

00:20:48.997 --> 00:20:52.270
<i>but I was terrified of being</i>
<i>alone with him this morning,</i>

00:20:52.370 --> 00:20:55.744
<i>but now it feels</i>
<i>so comfortable.</i>

00:20:55.844 --> 00:20:58.550
[Mei] I can't go get
my hair cut now.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:00.954
[Yamato] It looks
better long anyway.

00:21:01.054 --> 00:21:03.192
[Mei] Then maybe
I won't cut it...

00:21:03.292 --> 00:21:04.227
[Yamato] Really?

00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:07.568
[Mei] I-I haven't decided yet!

00:21:07.668 --> 00:21:09.839
Well, I don't think you need to.

00:21:09.939 --> 00:21:12.410
It's cute the way it is.

00:21:14.682 --> 00:21:17.153
[Mei] If you give
people your trust...

00:21:17.253 --> 00:21:19.324
If you associate with people...

00:21:19.424 --> 00:21:24.602
You're going to have problems
you don't have when you stay in
your shell and don't come out.

00:21:26.939 --> 00:21:29.845
Just like I have my wounds,

00:21:29.945 --> 00:21:33.887
I learned that Kurosawa-kun
has his, too.

00:21:33.987 --> 00:21:37.895
So instead of hiding in my
shell, I'm going to stand up...

00:21:39.765 --> 00:21:41.569
and face them.

00:21:46.946 --> 00:21:48.550
[Masashi] Aiko?

00:21:51.856 --> 00:21:54.060
<i>[Aiko] I am not...</i>

00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:55.897
<i>letting it end like this.</i>

00:23:30.419 --> 00:23:35.530
My first time experiencing the
warmth of someone's hand was
so nice and reassuring.

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:38.569
I hope I can truly come to
understand how wonderful it

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:40.439
can be to actually
connect with others.

00:23:40.540 --> 00:23:42.109
[Marshmellow] Keep your
hands off my Mei,

00:23:42.209 --> 00:23:44.648
Yamato Kurosawa. Meow.
