WEBVTT

00:00:01.436 --> 00:00:03.206
[Girl 2] What should
we sing next?

00:00:03.306 --> 00:00:05.310
[Nakanishi] Beats me.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.947
[Girl 2] Hey, why
are you eating that?

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:08.250
[Nakanishi] Because
it's good! Want some?

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.755
[Girl 2] You're eating
like a pig, Takashi!

00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:13.159
[Nakanishi] Yeah, yeah.
[Girl 2] I saw one of Megumi's
commercials yesterday.

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.495
[Girl 3] I love
the lip gloss one!

00:00:14.596 --> 00:00:15.364
Chow time!

00:00:15.464 --> 00:00:17.067
[Girl 2] Geez, you eat too much.

00:00:17.167 --> 00:00:18.671
Hey Tachibana.

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:20.440
Did you pick a song?

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:22.044
Uh, I can't sing.

00:00:22.144 --> 00:00:23.714
Okay. Here, Yamato.

00:00:23.814 --> 00:00:25.518
[Yamato] Uh, thanks.

00:00:25.618 --> 00:00:27.087
Mei, you're not singing?

00:00:27.187 --> 00:00:28.524
[Asami] Guess not.

00:00:35.103 --> 00:00:36.105
[Yamato] M-Mei.

00:00:36.974 --> 00:00:38.343
[Yamato] Mei.
[Mei] Huh?

00:00:39.613 --> 00:00:41.750
Mei, what about a duet?

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.521
Well?

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:44.388
[Mei] No way!

00:00:57.047 --> 00:00:58.383
[Yamato] I love you.

00:01:04.763 --> 00:01:06.132
Hey Mei?

00:01:06.232 --> 00:01:08.036
Why are you blushing like that?

00:01:09.773 --> 00:01:11.644
You know why I did that, right?

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:12.612
So he'd go away-

00:01:12.712 --> 00:01:13.714
[Mei] I know!

00:01:13.814 --> 00:01:15.718
I know, all right?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.197
[Yamato] Uh, that wasn't
your first time, was it?

00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.302
[Mei gasp]
[Yamato] Aw man, I'm sorry.

00:01:24.402 --> 00:01:26.406
[Mei] It's okay! You
don't have to apologize!

00:01:26.507 --> 00:01:29.211
[Yamato] Yeah, but...
[Mei] I said it's okay, dammit!

00:01:34.422 --> 00:01:38.163
I didn't think you'd actually
come all the way out here.

00:01:38.263 --> 00:01:41.637
Why not? I mean, why wouldn't I?

00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:44.408
I'm glad you called.

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.513
We got rid of your
stalker, right?

00:01:46.614 --> 00:01:49.786
Or maybe you didn't really need
my help after all, did you?

00:01:49.886 --> 00:01:52.859
No, what I meant to say was...

00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:56.533
I needed you! This time.

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:59.305
[Yamato laughs] This time only,
huh?

00:02:01.342 --> 00:02:03.981
So, I get to call you
next time, right?

00:02:04.081 --> 00:02:05.217
[Mei] What?

00:02:05.885 --> 00:02:07.421
I've got your number now.

00:02:12.732 --> 00:02:14.603
Uh, hang on.

00:02:16.472 --> 00:02:17.408
Here.

00:02:22.886 --> 00:02:24.221
[Yamato] Mei!

00:02:28.898 --> 00:02:30.835
I'm beat.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.239
Mei, let's walk home together.

00:02:35.578 --> 00:02:38.584
Look! I'll pay for half
the ice cream, okay?

00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:42.726
[Yamato] Don't worry about it.

00:02:42.826 --> 00:02:44.930
You already paid your share.

00:02:46.834 --> 00:02:47.902
When you kissed me.

00:02:53.514 --> 00:02:58.724
<i>[Mei] I don't understand</i>
<i>him, but maybe...</i>

00:02:58.824 --> 00:03:00.561
<i>I can try and trust him.</i>

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:02.766
<i>I guess.</i>

00:04:38.456 --> 00:04:39.926
[Yamato] Mei!

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:42.632
Why are you so late?

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:49.946
Are you alright?

00:04:55.958 --> 00:04:57.494
Mei?

00:05:09.151 --> 00:05:10.621
<i>Kurosawa is...</i>

00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:12.859
<i>the most popular guy at school.</i>

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:17.067
<i>There couldn't be a bigger</i>
<i>social gap between us.</i>

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.006
<i>But still...</i>

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:29.358
[Yamato] Good morning.

00:05:32.966 --> 00:05:34.636
What do you want?

00:05:34.736 --> 00:05:38.878
For one thing, I said good
morning. To you, okay?

00:05:38.978 --> 00:05:40.046
Good morning, Kurosawa.

00:05:40.146 --> 00:05:41.315
[Boy] Yamato!

00:05:41.415 --> 00:05:42.652
Ah, hey!

00:05:42.752 --> 00:05:43.888
See ya.

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:51.269
[Asami] Hey Tachibana!

00:05:51.369 --> 00:05:52.906
Mornin'!

00:05:53.006 --> 00:05:54.208
Morning Oikawa.

00:05:54.308 --> 00:05:55.645
Call me Asami, okay?

00:05:55.745 --> 00:05:57.347
Did Yamato already go to class?

00:05:57.447 --> 00:05:59.351
[Mei] Yeah.
[Asami] Darn it all.

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:01.857
I wanted to say good
morning to him too.

00:06:04.128 --> 00:06:07.535
You had me worried when
you just ran off yesterday.

00:06:07.635 --> 00:06:10.106
[Mei] I'm sorry.
[Asami] Hey, it's alright!

00:06:10.207 --> 00:06:13.346
I bet Yamato will want to hang
out with you again, sometime.

00:06:13.446 --> 00:06:18.958
[Asami] Oh yeah! I found
something completely adorable
on my way home yesterday.

00:06:19.058 --> 00:06:20.595
I got one for you.

00:06:20.695 --> 00:06:23.333
[Mei] Oh, thanks...
[Nakanishi] Furballs, Asami?

00:06:23.433 --> 00:06:26.540
Darn it, Takashi! I
bought that for Tachibana!

00:06:27.942 --> 00:06:30.013
[Nakanishi] Well, what
did you get for me, Asami?

00:06:30.113 --> 00:06:32.284
[Asami] Nothing, jerkface!
You called it a furball!

00:06:32.384 --> 00:06:36.593
[Nakanishi] Algae ball?
[Asami] It's not an algae
either! Give it back!

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:39.566
Well, I'm exhausted.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.477
<i>[Mei] Boys are so...</i>

00:06:45.578 --> 00:06:47.715
[Asami] By the way...

00:06:47.815 --> 00:06:51.255
You've got feelings
for Yamato, don't you?

00:06:51.355 --> 00:06:53.092
Did you kiss or have sex?

00:06:53.192 --> 00:06:54.495
Uh, I uh...

00:06:54.596 --> 00:06:56.633
[Asami] How many times?

00:06:56.733 --> 00:06:59.271
We only kissed... just once.

00:06:59.371 --> 00:07:01.677
I knew it. You're pretty cute,

00:07:01.777 --> 00:07:05.116
so I figured he'd want to kiss
you if he got the chance.

00:07:11.763 --> 00:07:14.736
I guess it goes without
saying, I've kissed him too.

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.111
God, I'm tired.

00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.514
Wanna skip next period?

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:22.384
Hey look, it's Melons.

00:07:22.484 --> 00:07:24.388
Melonzilla.

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:26.727
[Mean Girl A] God, they're
gross.

00:07:33.239 --> 00:07:34.609
[Asami] Let's go.

00:07:37.915 --> 00:07:40.387
[Mei] You're so strong, Asami.

00:07:40.487 --> 00:07:41.957
[Asami] Me? How so?

00:07:42.057 --> 00:07:45.397
You keep smiling, no matter
what people say about you.

00:07:45.497 --> 00:07:47.669
You don't get angry.

00:07:47.769 --> 00:07:50.608
Well, of course stuff
like that bothers me...

00:07:50.708 --> 00:07:53.379
But you know, I also have
a lot of people in my life

00:07:53.479 --> 00:07:56.485
who are nice to me and
accept me for who I am.

00:07:56.586 --> 00:08:01.863
Boys have been teasing me about
my breasts since middle school.
They were pretty merciless.

00:08:01.963 --> 00:08:06.472
I got to the point
where I didn't want
to go to school anymore.

00:08:06.573 --> 00:08:08.510
But something changed that...

00:08:11.717 --> 00:08:13.019
[Boy 1] Look at those knockers!

00:08:13.119 --> 00:08:16.727
[Boy 2] Sick dude!
Hey, make 'em bounce!

00:08:16.827 --> 00:08:20.166
[Yamato] The only sickos here,
are you two hypocrites.

00:08:22.104 --> 00:08:24.976
Remember that porn site you were
showing me the other day?

00:08:25.076 --> 00:08:27.982
You had like a thousand
bookmarks on chicks
with big boobs.

00:08:28.082 --> 00:08:29.686
[Boy] Dammit! Kurosawa!
[Yamato] It's okay.

00:08:29.786 --> 00:08:32.224
I'm a fan of big breast, myself.

00:08:32.324 --> 00:08:34.028
If you're gonna look, look.

00:08:34.128 --> 00:08:36.633
Just don't be a jerk and
act like you don't like it.

00:08:37.367 --> 00:08:38.771
Right?

00:08:40.006 --> 00:08:43.647
[Asami] He saved me, yanno?
Sticking up for me like that.

00:08:43.747 --> 00:08:46.787
And that's what he does.
He's sweet, he's kind.

00:08:46.887 --> 00:08:49.559
He's always looking
out for other people.

00:08:49.659 --> 00:08:51.295
He's cool.

00:08:51.395 --> 00:08:55.838
But someone like me? I
have a tough enough time
looking after myself.

00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.082
[Mei] Asami, um, do
you like Kurosawa?

00:09:01.182 --> 00:09:03.286
[Asami] Yeah, I do.

00:09:04.756 --> 00:09:06.192
But he doesn't like me.

00:09:06.292 --> 00:09:07.260
When I asked him to kiss me,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:09.331
it was almost too easy for him.

00:09:09.431 --> 00:09:13.406
I guess the thing is,
Yamato won't kiss a girl
he really has feelings for.

00:09:13.507 --> 00:09:18.617
I almost think think the idea
of being really close to someone
might make him a little scared.

00:09:18.717 --> 00:09:24.294
There's a rumor that Yamato's
kissed every cute girl at
school, except for one.

00:09:24.394 --> 00:09:27.668
It's supposedly
Arai from class B.

00:09:27.769 --> 00:09:29.471
They were in school
together at one time,

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:31.843
and I think she's
his one true love.

00:09:31.943 --> 00:09:34.214
Sometimes you can't
just beat that, yanno?

00:09:43.433 --> 00:09:45.771
[Mei's phone vibrates]

00:09:51.983 --> 00:09:55.724
Class B...

00:09:55.825 --> 00:09:56.626
[Phone begins vibrating again]

00:09:56.726 --> 00:09:58.362
Class B...

00:10:09.619 --> 00:10:10.955
[Mei] Hello?

00:10:11.055 --> 00:10:12.925
[Yamato] Mei, were you asleep?

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:14.662
[Mei] Yes, I was.

00:10:14.762 --> 00:10:16.700
[Yamato] Oh, sorry about that.

00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:20.273
[Yamato] How about
karaoke tomorrow?
[Mei] Again?

00:10:20.373 --> 00:10:23.412
[Yamato] With some of the
people from class B this time.

00:10:23.514 --> 00:10:27.487
[Mei] Um, there's this girl
named Arai. Is she coming?

00:10:27.588 --> 00:10:28.690
[Yamato] Y-yeah.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:31.028
[Mei] I heard she
was your first love.

00:10:31.128 --> 00:10:32.632
Yeah, o-okay.

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:38.811
Um, somebody told me that
you've actually kissed all
the girls in school...

00:10:40.648 --> 00:10:43.286
[Yamato] Uh, maybe.

00:10:43.386 --> 00:10:46.993
[Mei] They also said that you
wouldn't kiss a girl that you
were really interested in,

00:10:47.093 --> 00:10:50.601
because you're still carrying a
torch for this other girl, Arai.

00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:53.507
You know, and it
makes me wonder...

00:10:53.607 --> 00:10:56.947
if you'd kiss a girl
you really liked or not.

00:10:57.047 --> 00:11:00.153
Uh, the rumor mill's gonna keep
on milling out rumors, I guess.

00:11:00.253 --> 00:11:03.961
I do what I want, when I want,
and that's all there is to it.

00:11:04.562 --> 00:11:05.698
So you going tomorrow?

00:11:05.798 --> 00:11:07.000
[Mei] No, I'm not.

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:08.069
[Yamato] Huh?
[Mei hangs up]

00:11:08.169 --> 00:11:09.772
Mei, are you there?

00:11:14.047 --> 00:11:16.953
[Mei] "I do what
I want, when I want."

00:11:17.053 --> 00:11:18.991
You're not fooling me with that.

00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:30.814
<i>[Mei] So that's Arai.</i>

00:11:30.915 --> 00:11:33.987
<i>She a mannequin,</i>
<i>I'm a wallflower.</i>

00:11:34.087 --> 00:11:37.193
<i>She has friends, and I</i>
<i>lose my mind at karaoke.</i>

00:11:53.994 --> 00:11:57.969
<i>I wonder if Kurosawa</i>
<i>still likes her.</i>

00:11:58.069 --> 00:12:00.541
<i>This isn't good.</i>
<i>I don't like it.</i>

00:12:00.641 --> 00:12:04.816
<i>I know he had a good reason,</i>
<i>but for him to kiss me</i>
<i>like that without asking,</i>

00:12:04.916 --> 00:12:07.622
<i>when he hasn't declared</i>
<i>his feelings for her...</i>

00:12:07.722 --> 00:12:09.324
<i>Is she really that</i>
<i>important to him,</i>

00:12:09.424 --> 00:12:12.698
<i>or is he just playing the</i>
<i>field all over the place?</i>

00:12:12.798 --> 00:12:16.706
<i>Are the rest of us girls just</i>
<i>pieces on a chess board to him?</i>

00:12:17.808 --> 00:12:20.748
[Boy 1] What's she doing?
[Boy 2] Weirdo.

00:12:23.052 --> 00:12:26.058
[Mei] Weirdo, huh?!
Well excuse me!

00:12:26.158 --> 00:12:29.097
[Mean Girl 1] Man, that Asami
Oikawa's seriously annoying.

00:12:29.197 --> 00:12:31.468
[Mean Girl 2] She was hanging
all over Yamato again.

00:12:31.569 --> 00:12:33.807
[Mean Girl 1] Who the hell
does she think she is anyway?

00:12:33.907 --> 00:12:35.911
[Mean Girl 2] God, she's not
even good-looking, right?

00:12:36.011 --> 00:12:37.447
[Mean Girl 1] I'm serious!

00:12:37.548 --> 00:12:39.886
She doesn't need to go around
smothering all the guys with

00:12:39.986 --> 00:12:42.758
those saggy sweater
kittens of hers.

00:12:42.858 --> 00:12:45.196
[Both girls begin laughing]

00:12:47.668 --> 00:12:50.273
[Mei gives a small laugh]

00:12:50.373 --> 00:12:52.344
[Mean Girl 1] What
are you laughing at?

00:12:52.444 --> 00:12:56.251
[Mei] Two bitches who need
an attitude adjustment.

00:12:57.788 --> 00:12:59.124
[Mean Girls] What?

00:13:04.636 --> 00:13:06.706
[Yamato] What happened to you?

00:13:06.806 --> 00:13:07.775
[Mei] I fell.

00:13:07.875 --> 00:13:10.046
Huh? You fell where?

00:13:11.048 --> 00:13:12.150
[Yamato] Are you okay?
[Mei] Don't!

00:13:12.250 --> 00:13:13.954
Let me see that.

00:13:14.054 --> 00:13:15.958
It looks like someone hit you.

00:13:16.458 --> 00:13:18.162
[Mei] I fell!

00:13:18.664 --> 00:13:20.233
Okay.

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.905
I guess that's why you're
always carrying bandages.

00:13:23.005 --> 00:13:24.742
Kind of makes sense.

00:13:24.842 --> 00:13:26.078
Just be careful.

00:13:26.178 --> 00:13:27.815
If you keep getting
banged up like that,

00:13:27.915 --> 00:13:29.151
I'm gonna worry.

00:13:30.353 --> 00:13:31.355
You'd worry?

00:13:31.455 --> 00:13:32.558
Of course I would.

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:38.603
[Asami] Hey! There you are!

00:13:38.704 --> 00:13:40.808
We've got gym next,
so hurry up!

00:13:40.908 --> 00:13:43.045
Whoa! What happened
to your face?

00:13:43.145 --> 00:13:44.247
She tripped and fell.

00:13:44.348 --> 00:13:46.753
[Asami] What? Are
you okay, Tachibana?

00:13:46.853 --> 00:13:49.157
That looks really painful.

00:13:49.257 --> 00:13:58.543
[Girl 1] It went that way.
[Girl 2] Over here!

00:13:58.643 --> 00:13:59.712
Where's Asamicchi?

00:13:59.812 --> 00:14:00.748
[Ball being kicked]
[Boy] Nakanishi!

00:14:00.848 --> 00:14:02.183
Huh?

00:14:06.291 --> 00:14:08.062
Sorry I made you come with me.

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:09.732
[Asami] It's fine. I still need

00:14:09.832 --> 00:14:12.505
to tell someone
we're gonna be late.

00:14:12.605 --> 00:14:14.609
Let's see, who should I call?

00:14:19.719 --> 00:14:21.956
You've got your cellphone pet!

00:14:22.057 --> 00:14:23.325
We're a match!

00:14:24.294 --> 00:14:26.298
Uh, oh I embarassed
you, didn't I?

00:14:26.398 --> 00:14:27.568
Huh? Uh, uh-uh!

00:14:27.668 --> 00:14:29.706
Um, thanks. Really.

00:14:29.806 --> 00:14:31.375
[Mean Girl 1] I'm so tired.

00:14:31.475 --> 00:14:33.345
[Mean Girl 2] We're gonna
rest in here, 'kay?

00:14:34.949 --> 00:14:38.557
Well if it isn't Melonzilla
and super emo bitch.

00:14:38.657 --> 00:14:39.959
[Nakanishi groans in pain]

00:14:40.059 --> 00:14:42.464
[Mean Girl 2] Thanks
for the exercise.

00:14:44.367 --> 00:14:46.371
[Mean Girl 1] Seriously, girl.
Shouldn't you worry about your

00:14:46.472 --> 00:14:49.377
own ass before you go sticking
up for the space cadet, here?

00:14:49.478 --> 00:14:50.814
What?

00:14:50.914 --> 00:14:52.050
You confused her!

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.787
[Mean Girl 1] Ignorance
is bliss.

00:14:53.887 --> 00:14:56.960
You know what the boys in this
school call you, little girl?

00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.932
The girl with two brains.

00:15:02.605 --> 00:15:06.044
[Nakanishi] Hey! Don't
be jealous just because
you're flat-chested!

00:15:06.145 --> 00:15:08.984
It's better to actually have
boobs than not have any at all!

00:15:09.084 --> 00:15:10.654
And her's are just perfect!

00:15:10.754 --> 00:15:13.527
And while there are some members
of the male population of this

00:15:13.627 --> 00:15:15.931
school who think more
than a handful is a waste,

00:15:16.031 --> 00:15:18.102
I happen to like 'em humungous!

00:15:18.202 --> 00:15:19.839
The bigger the better, I say!

00:15:19.939 --> 00:15:21.743
Actually, size has
nothing to do with it!

00:15:21.843 --> 00:15:24.481
But Asamicchi's will
always be perfect!

00:15:26.185 --> 00:15:29.424
No! Hey... wait a minute!

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:30.393
Now that's funny!

00:15:30.493 --> 00:15:33.098
The horndog and
little Melonzilla.

00:15:33.199 --> 00:15:36.639
Guess you found your
dream lover after all.

00:15:36.739 --> 00:15:38.242
[Mei] Hey Asami!
[Nakanishi] Wait!

00:15:38.342 --> 00:15:39.579
[Nakanishi] That's
not what I meant!

00:15:39.679 --> 00:15:41.215
Asamicchi!

00:15:44.755 --> 00:15:46.793
[Nakanishi] She's mad.

00:15:46.893 --> 00:15:49.131
I've never seen her that pissed.

00:15:49.231 --> 00:15:55.944
Geez. I got hit in the face
with a soccer ball. I wasn't
"horndogging," dammit.

00:15:57.113 --> 00:16:00.787
Okay, I admit I was talking
about her chest again...

00:16:00.888 --> 00:16:04.127
But I meant what I
said. I wasn't trying
to hurt her feelings!

00:16:04.227 --> 00:16:06.766
Well, that's the
thing, Nakanishi.

00:16:06.866 --> 00:16:09.806
She's really sensative
about that.

00:16:09.906 --> 00:16:12.410
[Nakanishi] Why? I
think they're great!

00:16:13.312 --> 00:16:16.084
[Mei] That's your opinion.

00:16:16.185 --> 00:16:21.228
If you only think about
yourself, you'll end up
causing trouble for others.

00:16:24.167 --> 00:16:27.842
I guess she does get angry...

00:16:27.942 --> 00:16:32.985
From what I've seen, she usually
keeps her guard up around people
she doesn't know that well.

00:16:34.087 --> 00:16:36.091
You're special to her.

00:16:36.191 --> 00:16:38.462
And that's why her
feelings are hurt.

00:16:42.136 --> 00:16:44.542
[Nakanishi] What should
I do, Tachibana? Tell me.

00:16:46.278 --> 00:16:48.650
[Mei] Just tell
her how you feel.

00:16:52.791 --> 00:16:54.094
[Nakanishi] Asamicchi!

00:16:58.269 --> 00:17:00.541
Hang on a sec! Please wait!

00:17:03.445 --> 00:17:06.318
[Mei] I'm not one
to talk, though...

00:17:08.322 --> 00:17:10.393
[Nakanishi] Sorry about before.

00:17:10.493 --> 00:17:12.731
I must have embarrassed
you pretty bad.

00:17:13.499 --> 00:17:16.338
Even Tachibana got mad at me.

00:17:16.438 --> 00:17:21.448
I know that I'm not as
good-looking as Yamato,

00:17:21.549 --> 00:17:26.225
but I know I care about you
more than anybody possibly can!

00:17:28.797 --> 00:17:32.203
So, I'm saying I love you.

00:17:32.303 --> 00:17:34.976
I mean, sure I like your boobs,

00:17:35.076 --> 00:17:37.313
but that's not why I love you.

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:40.754
I like when you smile,
when you're happy...

00:17:40.854 --> 00:17:42.758
Your voice... Everything...

00:17:42.858 --> 00:17:47.668
Seeing you and all those
wonderful things about you
always makes my day.

00:17:47.768 --> 00:17:50.774
I want to be the first
person to see all of that.

00:17:50.874 --> 00:17:53.045
Every morning, before
everyone else.

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:02.430
Where's Nakanishi?

00:18:02.531 --> 00:18:04.401
Beats me. I think
he already left.

00:18:04.502 --> 00:18:07.307
Huh? What? He's not
going to karaoke?

00:18:07.407 --> 00:18:09.044
[Yamato] And Mei?
[Boy] Who's Mei?

00:18:09.144 --> 00:18:09.979
[Yamato] Mei Tachibana.

00:18:10.079 --> 00:18:12.350
Let's go, Yamato. Okay?

00:18:21.435 --> 00:18:22.470
Mei!

00:18:24.274 --> 00:18:26.244
I'll finish the dishes dear.

00:18:29.752 --> 00:18:31.589
[Mei's phone vibrates]

00:18:46.318 --> 00:18:51.294
Your popularity sure has
exploded since you got
to high school, Yamato.

00:18:51.395 --> 00:18:53.833
I haven't heard a lot of
good stories about you though.

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:57.273
Like you're womanizing
every girl who gets
within 20 feet of you.

00:18:57.373 --> 00:18:59.411
Haha, is that so?

00:18:59.512 --> 00:19:01.048
[Arai] That's what's
strange to me.

00:19:01.148 --> 00:19:03.887
You haven't womanized me yet.

00:19:03.987 --> 00:19:08.563
So why don't you drop the
pretenses and tell me how
much you like me?

00:19:08.663 --> 00:19:12.136
Come on. Didn't you like
me in middle school?

00:19:12.236 --> 00:19:14.007
You're so tall now.

00:19:14.107 --> 00:19:17.213
You know I'd let you put the
moves on me if you wanted to.

00:19:17.313 --> 00:19:21.154
Yamato, I just said I'd
let you. What do you say?

00:19:21.254 --> 00:19:24.762
Come on, didn't you kiss
that Mei Tachibana girl?

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:29.437
You kissed her, but
you won't kiss me?

00:19:29.538 --> 00:19:32.276
It's almost like
you don't want to.

00:19:32.377 --> 00:19:36.284
The thing is... Mei's a cutie
if you know what I mean.

00:19:36.385 --> 00:19:39.625
Kurosawa's still the knight
in shining armor, right?

00:19:41.596 --> 00:19:44.568
Hey, why don't we go outside?

00:20:11.956 --> 00:20:12.891
Hey stalker.

00:20:12.991 --> 00:20:14.260
[Mei] Uh, I'm not a stalker.

00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:15.864
I'm just going for a walk.

00:20:18.335 --> 00:20:19.672
Are you by yourself?

00:20:19.772 --> 00:20:21.108
[Yamato] Hm? Y-yeah.

00:20:21.208 --> 00:20:22.945
Okay...

00:20:23.045 --> 00:20:25.015
I thought you'd
come out with her.

00:20:25.116 --> 00:20:26.986
And what would you do if we did?

00:20:27.888 --> 00:20:29.992
Nothing! I wouldn't care!

00:20:30.894 --> 00:20:32.564
My walk's over. I'm leaving!

00:20:32.664 --> 00:20:34.568
There's nothing
between me and Arai!

00:20:36.071 --> 00:20:37.407
What are you-?!

00:20:40.514 --> 00:20:41.849
Why?! Let go of me!

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.991
What was that for?! Tell me!

00:20:46.926 --> 00:20:48.897
I guess I just felt like it.

00:20:53.439 --> 00:20:57.714
Oh really? Is that why
you kiss everyone?!

00:20:57.815 --> 00:21:01.823
Some girls get hurt when
you kiss them, dammit!

00:21:01.923 --> 00:21:07.400
A kiss that doesn't have
any love behind it doesn't
make me happy, you idiot!

00:21:10.239 --> 00:21:11.509
Don't!

00:21:11.609 --> 00:21:14.013
That the kiss I
use as a greeting.

00:21:17.855 --> 00:21:21.796
Okay, now only someone as cute
as you gets a kiss like that.

00:21:21.896 --> 00:21:22.764
<i>[Mei] What?</i>

00:21:22.865 --> 00:21:24.602
<i>What are you doing?</i>

00:21:24.702 --> 00:21:28.041
That was a kiss for someone
I want to go further with.

00:21:34.822 --> 00:21:39.598
That kiss had profound
feelings for the person
standing in front of me.

00:21:39.698 --> 00:21:41.769
Can you tell the
difference, Mei?

00:21:45.744 --> 00:21:49.117
Do you like me,
or don't you, Mei?

00:21:49.217 --> 00:21:54.427
<i>[Mei] How am I supposed to</i>
<i>answer that all of a sudden?</i>

00:21:54.528 --> 00:21:58.001
[Yamato] If you don't
say anything, I'll
kiss you for real.

00:22:02.143 --> 00:22:07.654
<i>[Mei] Kurosawa notices me,</i>
<i>and looks right at me</i>
<i>when he talks to me.</i>

00:22:07.754 --> 00:22:11.796
<i>It makes me so happy,</i>
<i>why deny it?</i>

00:22:11.896 --> 00:22:16.471
When I think about you, Yamato,
my heart just keeps on pounding.

00:22:17.608 --> 00:22:21.448
Well then. Isn't that the
very definition of love?

00:22:23.853 --> 00:22:29.632
[Mei] And right after he said
that, Kurosawa really kissed me.

00:22:29.732 --> 00:22:35.309
Not that it matters, but his
so-called emotional kiss...

00:22:35.409 --> 00:22:37.648
tasted like fried chicken.

00:23:29.952 --> 00:23:32.423
Kisses... Kisses...

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:34.160
[Marshmellow] Rah?
Do I hear mice?!

00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.530
[Mei] A greeting
kiss, a real kiss...

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:37.033
I had no idea there
were so many kinds.

00:23:37.133 --> 00:23:39.605
[Marshmellow] Where are all
these mice hiding, meow?!

00:23:39.705 --> 00:23:42.611
[Mei] But the important thing
is that they're full of feeling.

00:23:42.711 --> 00:23:44.882
What matters most
is our sincerity.
