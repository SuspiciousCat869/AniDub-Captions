00:00:04.141 --> 00:00:05.477
[Mei] <i>I...</i>

00:00:06.947 --> 00:00:07.749
Mei?

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:09.653
[Mei] <i>I really...</i>

00:00:10.955 --> 00:00:12.324
<i>I really...</i>

00:00:15.264 --> 00:00:19.773
<i>Yamato, what do I need to</i>
<i>do to make you only mine?</i>

00:00:20.775 --> 00:00:22.344
<i>I can't say it out loud,</i>

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:26.587
<i>but I've called you "Yamato"</i>
<i>plenty of times inside my head.</i>

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.564
<i>Yamato, are you the kind</i>
<i>of person who doesn't</i>

00:00:31.664 --> 00:00:34.068
<i>have a problem going</i>
<i>to other girls' homes,</i>

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:36.439
<i>even though you</i>
<i>have a girlfriend?</i>

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:53.674
Mei...

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:02.659
[Yamato] Mei!

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:09.038
Let's go home together today!

00:02:46.934 --> 00:02:49.573
[Yamato] It's been a while
since we walked home together.

00:02:49.673 --> 00:02:53.781
Seems like I've done nothing
but photo shoots after school.

00:02:53.881 --> 00:02:54.883
[Mei] Yeah.

00:02:59.325 --> 00:03:01.864
<i>I'm the one who</i>
<i>suggested he do it.</i>

00:03:01.964 --> 00:03:03.501
[Yamato] What's wrong?

00:03:03.601 --> 00:03:04.736
[Mei] Nothing.

00:03:04.836 --> 00:03:05.938
[Yamato] You're quiet.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.243
[Mei] I'm always quiet.

00:03:08.343 --> 00:03:09.546
[Yamato] Okay.

00:03:12.251 --> 00:03:13.954
Do you want to stop
by the park?

00:03:14.055 --> 00:03:15.257
[Mei] Sure.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:24.509
[Yamato] Oh, by the way,
Kuro's been getting bigger.

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:28.651
You might be surprised if
you saw the little guy now.

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:31.957
They're only kittens
for a short time.

00:03:32.057 --> 00:03:33.460
Look away for just a second,

00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:35.932
and they'll look
completely different.

00:03:36.032 --> 00:03:37.034
I see.

00:03:37.134 --> 00:03:38.369
Yeah.

00:03:39.606 --> 00:03:43.046
You know Mei, I'm glad
we set this time aside.

00:03:43.146 --> 00:03:44.482
I get to hear
what's on your mind,

00:03:44.583 --> 00:03:46.419
and you get to hear
what's on mine.

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.423
It's important, you know?

00:03:49.893 --> 00:03:53.266
[Mei] <i>How did he act when</i>
<i>he was with Megumi-san?</i>

00:03:54.235 --> 00:03:55.972
<i>A Yamato I don't know...</i>

00:03:57.141 --> 00:03:59.345
[Yamato] Mei?
Is something wrong?

00:04:00.347 --> 00:04:02.284
[Mei] No.

00:04:02.384 --> 00:04:03.754
[Yamato] By the way,

00:04:03.854 --> 00:04:06.827
Kitagawa asked me if I wanted
to keep on doing shoots

00:04:06.927 --> 00:04:08.229
for <i>Dessert.</i>

00:04:11.035 --> 00:04:12.839
Do it if you want to...

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:15.678
You told me I looked
handsome the other day,

00:04:15.778 --> 00:04:18.383
so I think I'll do it
a little bit longer.

00:04:19.318 --> 00:04:21.055
[Mei] What?

00:04:21.155 --> 00:04:23.226
I guess I was curious
whether or not

00:04:23.326 --> 00:04:26.432
there would be another
big surprise today.

00:04:26.533 --> 00:04:28.303
[sigh]
When you look at me like that,

00:04:28.403 --> 00:04:30.073
it creeps me out, okay?

00:04:30.173 --> 00:04:31.610
[Mei] You need to stop.

00:04:40.528 --> 00:04:43.333
[Yamato] Mei, I'm sorry
you're creeped out.

00:04:52.117 --> 00:04:53.687
I'm going home.

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:16.465
[Mei] <i>That's the first time...</i>

00:05:17.301 --> 00:05:19.773
<i>Kurosawa let go of my hand...</i>

00:05:31.162 --> 00:05:35.872
[mom] Hey, do you think the mud
in a mud pack is actually mud
or is it something else?

00:05:35.972 --> 00:05:39.913
Wow, it says this is a
combination of mud from
three different countries.

00:05:40.013 --> 00:05:41.750
It even has seaweed extract.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:44.990
I wonder which three countries
they're talking about.

00:05:46.292 --> 00:05:47.729
Hey.

00:05:47.829 --> 00:05:49.533
I don't know.

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:52.337
By the way, how are things
with your boyfriend?

00:05:53.507 --> 00:05:54.809
Good, I guess.

00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.886
Okay.

00:06:03.126 --> 00:06:04.161
[door opening]

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:05.665
[Mei] Good night.

00:06:11.777 --> 00:06:13.948
[Mei] <i>What's wrong with me?</i>

00:06:14.048 --> 00:06:15.685
<i>I don't like how I'm acting.</i>

00:06:15.785 --> 00:06:18.757
<i>I need to get it together.</i>

00:06:18.857 --> 00:06:21.697
[Asami] Hey, Mei-chan,
are you okay?

00:06:21.797 --> 00:06:22.899
[Mei] Huh?

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:24.869
[Aiko] You look awful.

00:06:25.337 --> 00:06:27.007
I-I'm okay...

00:06:27.107 --> 00:06:29.011
What's okay about you?

00:06:29.111 --> 00:06:32.084
[imitating a drumroll]

00:06:32.184 --> 00:06:34.623
[Asami] Ta-da! It's a magic key.

00:06:35.524 --> 00:06:36.960
That's nice...

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:38.296
What's it for?

00:06:38.396 --> 00:06:40.367
[Asami] Take it.

00:06:40.467 --> 00:06:42.371
Now, you match with Yamato.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.410
Apparently, it's a
limited edition design

00:06:45.511 --> 00:06:48.016
celebrating Land's
20th anniversary.

00:06:48.116 --> 00:06:52.257
Nakanishi gave one to Yamato,
too, so now you're a match.

00:06:52.357 --> 00:06:54.361
[Mei] Th-Thanks.

00:06:54.461 --> 00:06:55.665
[giggle]

00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:04.749
That amusement park...
Is it really that much fun...

00:07:04.849 --> 00:07:07.722
i-if the two of you
go as a couple?

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.540
Mei-chan, you're becoming such
a girl right before our eyes.

00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:18.911
It's really amazing how
cute you've become, too.

00:07:19.011 --> 00:07:20.180
You know that?

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:21.349
That's not true...

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:23.052
Yes it is.

00:07:23.152 --> 00:07:24.321
You know, if I were Yamato,

00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:26.760
I'd worry about you
growing up so fast.

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:28.029
[giggle]

00:07:31.268 --> 00:07:32.437
[Asami] Mei-chan?

00:07:32.538 --> 00:07:34.542
I'll treasure it, really.

00:07:34.643 --> 00:07:36.580
[Asami] Put it on your phone.

00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:45.130
[Mei] <i>I need to apologize</i>
<i>to Kurosawa.</i>

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:46.967
[Megumi] That's so cute.

00:07:47.067 --> 00:07:51.008
That key! I bet Yamato
has one just like it.

00:07:52.745 --> 00:07:54.983
Asami-san just gave it to me.

00:07:55.083 --> 00:07:56.620
That's awesome, Mei-chan.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.491
You and Yamato-kun
make a great couple.

00:08:00.327 --> 00:08:01.563
So long.

00:08:08.677 --> 00:08:11.415
[Mei] <i>I shouldn't worry</i>
<i>about rumors.</i>

00:08:11.516 --> 00:08:12.985
<i>I should trust him.</i>

00:08:13.654 --> 00:08:14.989
[Nakanishi] What the heck?

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:17.394
Yamato, you didn't even
attach your key chain yet.

00:08:17.494 --> 00:08:20.133
Huh? Oh, I'll put it
on later, okay?

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.636
Put it on now, dude.

00:08:21.737 --> 00:08:22.872
[Yamato] Okay, okay.

00:08:22.972 --> 00:08:24.676
[Nakanishi] Really.
[Yamato] Yeah, I will.

00:08:24.776 --> 00:08:26.980
[Nakanishi] Don't tell me you're
embarrassed about this now.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.318
[girl 1] Hey, did you read
Megu-tan's interview?

00:08:29.418 --> 00:08:31.055
She said there's
someone she likes.

00:08:31.155 --> 00:08:34.228
He's a model like her,
and he's like a prince...

00:08:34.328 --> 00:08:35.798
[girl 2] It's got to be Yamato.

00:08:35.898 --> 00:08:37.602
There's even a rumor
that Yamato was seen

00:08:37.702 --> 00:08:39.739
coming out of Megu-tan's place.

00:08:39.839 --> 00:08:41.510
[girl 1] Tachibana
is in trouble.

00:08:41.610 --> 00:08:43.112
[girl 2] But no matter
how you look at it,

00:08:43.212 --> 00:08:45.450
Yamato and Megu-tan would
make a better couple.

00:08:45.551 --> 00:08:47.054
[giggling]
[girl 1] You said it.

00:08:47.154 --> 00:08:49.759
[giggling]

00:09:19.384 --> 00:09:22.491
Huh? Mei-chan,
you're leaving early?

00:09:22.592 --> 00:09:23.861
I don't feel well.

00:09:23.961 --> 00:09:26.265
W-Wait, I'll walk home with you.

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.471
[Mei] It's okay.

00:09:29.572 --> 00:09:32.310
I should be alone right now...

00:09:33.279 --> 00:09:34.481
[Asami] But...

00:09:34.582 --> 00:09:37.320
[Mei] I need time
to clear my head.

00:09:39.358 --> 00:09:40.661
Uh, Mei-chan.

00:09:40.761 --> 00:09:42.330
Give her space, Asami.

00:09:43.366 --> 00:09:44.869
Okay...

00:09:44.969 --> 00:09:48.577
Right now, she's fighting with
herself about all this nonsense.

00:09:48.677 --> 00:09:51.215
When she's ready
to talk, she'll come around.

00:09:52.484 --> 00:09:56.325
[Asami] Huh... Do you think
she read Megu-tan's interview?

00:09:59.064 --> 00:10:03.941
Even if she didn't, she's
probably hearing someone
else gossip about it.

00:10:05.878 --> 00:10:06.947
[sigh]

00:10:07.047 --> 00:10:09.719
[Aiko] And I managed
to scare this up.

00:10:09.819 --> 00:10:11.923
Want to hit Mr. Donut
on the way home?

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:16.600
Aiko-chan!

00:10:16.700 --> 00:10:19.204
[giggling]

00:10:19.304 --> 00:10:20.841
[Aiko] <i>You know, Yamato,</i>

00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.881
<i>you're making a lot of</i>
<i>people worry right now.</i>

00:10:34.468 --> 00:10:36.606
[Yamato] Aiko, I got your text.

00:10:36.706 --> 00:10:38.075
Everything okay?

00:10:46.927 --> 00:10:49.298
[Aiko] I'm guessing you
haven't read this yet,

00:10:49.398 --> 00:10:53.841
[mockingly]
but maybe you can guess who
little Megu-tan's prince is.

00:10:57.849 --> 00:11:00.119
We know. You've been
coming and going

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:03.392
from Megumi Kitagawa's
place lately, haven't you?

00:11:03.492 --> 00:11:04.629
Someone saw you.

00:11:04.729 --> 00:11:07.167
Rumors are spreading,
and me, Asami,

00:11:07.267 --> 00:11:09.939
and probably everyone
else at school knows about it.

00:11:10.039 --> 00:11:12.945
And of course by "everybody",
I mean Mei, too.

00:11:15.149 --> 00:11:18.256
Tachibana... she was so shocked,
she went home.

00:11:18.356 --> 00:11:21.563
Wait. There's nothing between
me and Kitagawa.

00:11:21.663 --> 00:11:22.932
It was just dinner, Aiko.

00:11:23.032 --> 00:11:25.871
[Aiko] Said the fly about
the spider, you dunce.

00:11:27.575 --> 00:11:29.278
Even if nothing is happening,

00:11:29.378 --> 00:11:32.718
you're turning that girlfriend
of yours into a nervous wreck.

00:11:32.818 --> 00:11:35.356
[Aiko] Look at it
this way, Kurosawa:

00:11:35.456 --> 00:11:41.570
One day, Tachibana meets some
guy and then goes running back
to his apartment with him.

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:45.076
You don't know about it and
she decides on top of that,
not to tell you.

00:11:45.176 --> 00:11:47.314
So, are you going
to forgive her?

00:11:47.414 --> 00:11:48.482
It's not like that...

00:11:48.584 --> 00:11:49.986
[Aiko] It's exactly like that.

00:11:50.086 --> 00:11:52.324
I'm guessing you wouldn't
like it very much.

00:11:53.794 --> 00:11:55.129
That's what you did.

00:11:55.230 --> 00:11:57.167
And Tachibana is going
to worry herself sick

00:11:57.267 --> 00:12:00.473
every time you go on a
photoshoot from now on.

00:12:00.574 --> 00:12:05.016
[Aiko] She's held all these
feelings in and tried to
encourage you at the same time.

00:12:06.686 --> 00:12:08.122
It's got to be hard, seriously.

00:12:08.222 --> 00:12:10.761
[Yamato] But I really didn't
do anything with Kitagawa.

00:12:10.861 --> 00:12:12.030
[Aiko] Okay, fine.

00:12:12.130 --> 00:12:12.865
Just saying,

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:14.836
you need to tell her about it.

00:12:21.248 --> 00:12:24.622
[Aiko] Go to her.
Tell her. Fix it now.

00:12:24.722 --> 00:12:28.597
[dial tone]
[Yamato] Hello? Mei?

00:12:28.697 --> 00:12:31.135
[phone] We're sorry,
but your call cannot
be completed as dialed.

00:12:31.235 --> 00:12:34.041
The number you have called
is either outside the
service area or you may-

00:12:34.141 --> 00:12:35.711
[Yamato] Mei.
[phone hanging up]

00:12:35.811 --> 00:12:37.013
[Aiko] You have to put your
relationship ahead

00:12:37.113 --> 00:12:39.451
of being nice to everyone
else sometimes.

00:12:39.552 --> 00:12:40.587
[panting]

00:12:40.688 --> 00:12:42.959
[Yamato] Mei, I'm sorry.

00:12:43.994 --> 00:12:45.463
[Mei] <i>Why did I...</i>

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.436
When you look at me like that,

00:12:48.537 --> 00:12:50.273
it creeps me out, okay?

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:54.281
[Mei] <i>Why didn't</i>
<i>I apologize right away?</i>

00:12:54.381 --> 00:12:57.420
<i>Why didn't I tell him</i>
<i>I was just being shy?</i>

00:12:58.456 --> 00:12:59.926
<i>No...</i>

00:13:00.026 --> 00:13:03.432
<i>Why didn't I ask him why</i>
<i>he went to Megumi-san's place?</i>

00:13:03.533 --> 00:13:06.539
<i>I should have asked him</i>
<i>that before I said anything...</i>

00:13:07.307 --> 00:13:09.545
[phone vibrating]

00:13:09.646 --> 00:13:10.981
[beep]
[Yamato] Hello?

00:13:11.081 --> 00:13:12.350
[Megumi] Yamato-kun.

00:13:12.450 --> 00:13:13.687
Where are you?

00:13:13.787 --> 00:13:16.091
You suddenly disappeared.
I was so surprised.

00:13:16.191 --> 00:13:17.528
[Yamato] Sorry, Kitagawa.

00:13:17.628 --> 00:13:19.031
I can't go to the shoot today.

00:13:19.131 --> 00:13:21.435
I'll call the agency
myself, okay?

00:13:21.536 --> 00:13:23.507
[Megumi] Huh? What? Hey.

00:13:23.607 --> 00:13:26.445
Yamato...
[dial tone]

00:13:28.817 --> 00:13:30.053
Tch.

00:13:31.856 --> 00:13:34.428
[woman] Huh? Mei-chan?

00:13:34.529 --> 00:13:38.469
I'm sorry. Is it too early
for me to start today?

00:13:38.570 --> 00:13:39.839
[woman] No, it's fine.

00:13:39.939 --> 00:13:42.410
Did something happen?

00:13:42.511 --> 00:13:45.984
No, ma'am.

00:13:46.085 --> 00:13:47.688
[Mei] <i>Well, good...</i>

00:13:47.788 --> 00:13:52.063
<i>Mom's home and I don't want to</i>
<i>worry her by coming home early.</i>

00:13:57.808 --> 00:13:59.812
[doorbell]

00:14:04.622 --> 00:14:06.626
[mom] Yes?

00:14:06.726 --> 00:14:08.597
[Yamato] Is Mei-san there?

00:14:09.932 --> 00:14:11.569
Oh, my name is Kurosawa.

00:14:11.669 --> 00:14:13.272
[mom] She isn't home yet.

00:14:14.509 --> 00:14:15.711
I see.

00:14:15.811 --> 00:14:17.347
I beg your pardon.

00:14:19.317 --> 00:14:20.319
Hmm?

00:14:30.941 --> 00:14:32.410
Welcome.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:40.994
Oh, my.

00:14:50.313 --> 00:14:51.516
Just these.

00:14:51.883 --> 00:14:53.352
Yes.

00:14:59.632 --> 00:15:01.368
[gasp]
[Kai] That!

00:15:01.468 --> 00:15:03.740
That's from Land's 20th
anniversary, isn't it?

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.642
[nervous sounds]

00:15:04.742 --> 00:15:06.078
It is, right!?

00:15:08.583 --> 00:15:10.587
[Mei] Let go.
[Kai] Huh?

00:15:10.687 --> 00:15:13.760
It's rude to just go and
grab someone's hand like that.

00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:15.798
[Kai] Oh, sorry!

00:15:15.898 --> 00:15:18.235
It's just that I like
going to Land so much!

00:15:18.335 --> 00:15:21.241
Going there has always put
a smile on my face. Uh...

00:15:22.043 --> 00:15:23.847
[Kai] Oh, I-I mean, sorry.

00:15:23.947 --> 00:15:27.855
Anyway, I can never
ignore limited editions
and anniversaries!

00:15:27.955 --> 00:15:29.759
I went to buy that key
chain right away,

00:15:29.859 --> 00:15:32.263
but it went on sale the same day

00:15:32.363 --> 00:15:34.902
the Halloween concert
started, right?

00:15:35.002 --> 00:15:37.340
I really wouldn't
know about that...

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.545
[Kai] Why did I have
to start with a concert?

00:15:39.645 --> 00:15:44.154
I should have gotten that first
and then gone to the show
afterward, damn it!

00:15:46.391 --> 00:15:48.864
That key is so doggone cute...

00:15:48.964 --> 00:15:52.638
Limited editions are different
from everything else they issue.

00:15:52.738 --> 00:15:54.609
[Kai] I really want one.

00:15:54.709 --> 00:15:56.613
Man, I can't help myself.

00:15:57.982 --> 00:15:59.619
Give it to me! Pretty please!

00:15:59.719 --> 00:16:02.992
[Mei] Uh...
[woman] Even if you ask,
I don't believe-

00:16:03.092 --> 00:16:05.029
[Kai] No, ma'am.

00:16:05.129 --> 00:16:07.400
I'm not giving up on this
endeavor, miss.

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.143
I know it's not customary
among Land lovers to be
so materialistic,

00:16:12.243 --> 00:16:15.049
but will you let me have
that magic key?

00:16:17.053 --> 00:16:18.355
[Nakanishi] What the heck?

00:16:18.455 --> 00:16:20.761
Yamato, you didn't even
attach your key chain yet.

00:16:20.861 --> 00:16:21.763
I'll put it on later.

00:16:21.863 --> 00:16:23.465
Put it on now, dude.

00:16:23.567 --> 00:16:25.436
Okay, just a minute.

00:16:29.144 --> 00:16:32.618
Look, I get the fact you like
Land more than anything,

00:16:32.718 --> 00:16:34.856
but I can't give this to you.

00:16:34.956 --> 00:16:36.291
I'm sorry.

00:16:36.391 --> 00:16:40.399
Oh, no... I'm sorry for being
so obnoxious about it.

00:16:43.072 --> 00:16:44.207
See ya.

00:16:44.307 --> 00:16:46.880
[Mei] Thank you very much.

00:16:46.980 --> 00:16:50.419
Oh, I should've said,
I'm Kai Takemura.

00:16:50.521 --> 00:16:53.325
I'll be starting at
Toumei High next week.

00:16:53.425 --> 00:16:55.463
And I'll stop by again sometime.

00:16:58.503 --> 00:17:00.807
He's a student?

00:17:00.908 --> 00:17:02.443
At my school?

00:17:02.545 --> 00:17:03.647
Whoa...

00:17:58.255 --> 00:18:01.395
[Mei] <i>I wonder...</i>
<i>Did Yamato put his on?</i>

00:18:05.036 --> 00:18:07.407
[sniffle]

00:18:09.745 --> 00:18:13.185
<i>I really like Yamato.</i>

00:18:14.154 --> 00:18:15.891
<i>It hurts.</i>

00:18:15.991 --> 00:18:18.028
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

00:18:18.128 --> 00:18:20.232
<i>I have no idea.</i>

00:18:20.333 --> 00:18:22.571
<i>I'm clueless.</i>

00:18:22.671 --> 00:18:27.213
<i>Ever since I really started</i>
<i>liking Yamato...</i>

00:18:27.313 --> 00:18:29.619
<i>I've felt nothing but pain.</i>

00:18:30.721 --> 00:18:31.756
[snap]

00:19:05.356 --> 00:19:07.360
[running steps]

00:19:11.602 --> 00:19:12.838
[Yamato] Mei!

00:19:13.707 --> 00:19:16.813
[sigh]
[panting]

00:19:20.252 --> 00:19:21.856
[Yamato] I'm sorry, Mei.

00:19:27.768 --> 00:19:28.903
What...

00:19:32.544 --> 00:19:33.713
Mei...

00:19:34.381 --> 00:19:35.917
[Yamato] I'm so sorry.

00:19:50.479 --> 00:19:52.951
[Mei] I-I've had enough.

00:19:56.158 --> 00:19:58.563
Since I started liking you...

00:19:59.732 --> 00:20:02.938
My head's been full
of thoughts about you.

00:20:05.242 --> 00:20:07.948
I've become so narrow-minded.

00:20:13.358 --> 00:20:18.102
[Mei] I want to support your
modeling work, but I can't.

00:20:18.202 --> 00:20:23.278
I pushed Asami-san and Aiko-san
away when they were worried
about me.

00:20:24.481 --> 00:20:27.120
I want to believe Megumi-san
is a good person,

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.457
but I just can't do it.

00:20:33.933 --> 00:20:36.973
I'm turning into the kind
of person I don't like...

00:20:40.847 --> 00:20:42.450
No, that isn't true, Mei!

00:20:42.551 --> 00:20:45.657
I deserve the blame...
You haven't changed at all!

00:20:45.757 --> 00:20:47.895
It's my fault that you're
feeling this way

00:20:47.995 --> 00:20:48.830
and it isn't right at all.

00:20:48.930 --> 00:20:49.698
[Mei] It's fine.

00:20:49.799 --> 00:20:50.901
It's not fine!

00:20:51.001 --> 00:20:52.738
Let me explain myself!

00:20:55.577 --> 00:20:57.714
There's nothing between
me and Kitagawa.

00:20:57.815 --> 00:20:59.585
But I shouldn't have gone
to her house with her

00:20:59.685 --> 00:21:02.190
and not told you
about it afterwards...

00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:04.294
Aiko had to tell me.

00:21:05.062 --> 00:21:06.732
It was thoughtless of me.

00:21:06.833 --> 00:21:10.239
[Yamato] But, Mei,
I really do love you.

00:21:10.974 --> 00:21:12.644
I'm really sorry.

00:21:39.632 --> 00:21:40.767
Mei...

00:21:48.716 --> 00:21:49.718
[sigh]

00:21:51.321 --> 00:21:53.860
[Mei] <i>I guess Yamato</i>
<i>and I are both...</i>

00:21:55.229 --> 00:21:57.066
<i>new to love...</i>

00:23:30.553 --> 00:23:32.423
[Mei] When we meet someone...
[Marshmallow] Meow.

00:23:32.524 --> 00:23:34.227
[Mei] And even when
we sometimes disagree...

00:23:34.327 --> 00:23:37.099
[Marshmallow] Meow.
[Mei] We come to understand
each other bit by bit.

00:23:37.199 --> 00:23:39.805
[Marshmallow] Meow, meow.
[Mei] We should treasure
each and every...

00:23:39.905 --> 00:23:42.276
[Marshmallow] Meow.
[Mei] ...event that happens.

00:23:42.376 --> 00:23:44.013
[Marshmallow] Meow...
