WEBVTT

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.812
[Cameraman] Mmmm yeah!
Awesome! Awesome!

00:00:05.912 --> 00:00:07.716
Aw, make me feel it, baby!

00:00:08.851 --> 00:00:10.354
[Editor] Fantastic, isn't she?

00:00:10.454 --> 00:00:12.626
[Manager] She's our agency's
most sought-after model.

00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:16.901
[Editor] You got any guys?
Someone who could hold their
own in a shoot with Megu-tan?

00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.642
[Manager] I'll give it
a shot. But hey, can't
promise you anything.

00:02:02.111 --> 00:02:04.215
[Yamato] Look, Mei.

00:02:04.315 --> 00:02:08.189
[Mei] Wow. He's usually
more cautious than that.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.928
[Yamato] Well, he's
friendly most of the time.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:13.333
He's just shy and high-strung.

00:02:13.433 --> 00:02:15.170
Right?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.844
Ow! I guess he was being
high-strung that time.

00:02:18.944 --> 00:02:20.581
Are you okay?

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.484
Uh, yeah. I'll live.

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:26.492
Cats can get a little chewy
when you get them too wound up.

00:02:28.463 --> 00:02:31.469
[Yamato] You don't think
he hates me, do you?

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:33.541
[Mei] You're fine, trust me.

00:02:33.641 --> 00:02:36.914
He wouldn't let you anywhere
near him if he hated you.

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:38.918
[Yamato] Okay.

00:02:40.588 --> 00:02:43.426
[Yamato] What about you?
[Mei] Hm?

00:02:43.527 --> 00:02:45.598
[Yamato] Do you like me?

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.169
Where did that come from?

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.140
[Mei's phone vibrates]

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.850
[Yamato] Who's it from?

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.922
Uh, um, my mom.

00:02:58.023 --> 00:02:59.492
[Yamato] You gonna
text her back?

00:02:59.593 --> 00:03:02.599
Yeah. I will a little later.

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:04.703
[Yamato] Okay.

00:03:04.803 --> 00:03:07.642
[Yamato] What do you want
to do on the way home today?

00:03:07.742 --> 00:03:09.278
Wanna stop somewhere?

00:03:09.378 --> 00:03:11.917
[Mei] Um... I'm busy today.

00:03:12.017 --> 00:03:13.821
[Yamato] What about tomorrow?

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.525
[Mei] I have to work.

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.430
[Yamato] Ah ha! You're
cutting me off for a while.

00:03:18.531 --> 00:03:20.935
[Mei] It-it's not that...

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:23.206
I'm sorry...

00:03:29.853 --> 00:03:30.955
[Yamato] I know.

00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:43.781
[Nakanishi] Yamato!
[Asami] Hey!

00:03:43.881 --> 00:03:46.887
What the heck?! Did
something good happen
that I outta know about?

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.993
Something good?

00:03:50.093 --> 00:03:51.864
You've got a dirty
little mind, Yamato.

00:03:51.964 --> 00:03:54.836
[Yamato] What?
[Asami] The two of you
are happy too, aren't you?

00:03:54.936 --> 00:03:56.840
[Nakanishi] Things are
going well with you and
Tachibana, right?

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.384
So tell everybody how happy
you are! Know what I mean?!

00:04:02.484 --> 00:04:04.355
Like me and my honey, Asamicchi!

00:04:04.455 --> 00:04:06.325
You're such a dummy, Takeshi.

00:04:06.426 --> 00:04:09.131
[Nakanishi] A dummy in love,
baby. A dummy in love.

00:04:09.231 --> 00:04:10.601
[Asami and Nakanishi giggle]

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:25.297
[Mei] They're delicious!
How do you do it?

00:04:25.397 --> 00:04:29.639
[Nagi] I guess you could
say I put my heart into
everything I make.

00:04:29.739 --> 00:04:32.645
As long as you take your
time and don't cut corners,

00:04:32.745 --> 00:04:34.983
it'll always be
naturally tasty.

00:04:35.083 --> 00:04:37.589
I-I believe you.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:41.028
But I still don't think I've got
an ounce of pastry chef in me.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:44.803
I'll text you a recipe later
that even you can handle.

00:04:44.903 --> 00:04:47.174
Really?

00:04:47.274 --> 00:04:50.648
No way! I'll still find
a way to mess it up.

00:04:50.748 --> 00:04:51.683
[Nagi] Hey!

00:04:51.783 --> 00:04:54.488
I can't do it without
your phone number.

00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:08.617
[Yamato] Nakanishi and
Asami sure are doing well.

00:05:08.717 --> 00:05:11.122
They're getting hormones
all over the place.

00:05:11.222 --> 00:05:13.092
But, it's cute.

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:17.267
I like seeing the two of them
happy. They deserve it, yanno.

00:05:17.367 --> 00:05:18.804
Yeah. They do.

00:05:20.975 --> 00:05:23.079
[Mei] Well, bye for now.

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:27.354
Mei.

00:05:29.526 --> 00:05:31.329
Um, Kurosawa?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.703
Yamato.

00:05:38.443 --> 00:05:41.650
I'd really like it if
you called me by my name.

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.923
I'm... I'm just not
ready to do that.

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:46.593
Not yet.

00:05:50.501 --> 00:05:53.206
I'll get you to say it one day,

00:05:53.306 --> 00:05:56.112
Get ready for that day, Mei-san.

00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.629
[Mei] So, first
I sift the flour.

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.902
Why do I need to do
that when I mix it later?

00:06:08.002 --> 00:06:10.140
How many eggs again?

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:11.777
Can I use a colander?

00:06:15.016 --> 00:06:16.687
[Ms. Tachibana] I'm home!

00:06:20.795 --> 00:06:24.068
Now this is unusual. So
what are you making for us?

00:06:24.168 --> 00:06:25.437
[Mei] Uh, nothing...

00:06:25.538 --> 00:06:26.974
You're home early.

00:06:27.074 --> 00:06:30.514
[Ms. Tachibana] Really? I told
you when I'd be coming home.

00:06:30.615 --> 00:06:33.353
Oooh, cookies, huh?

00:06:33.453 --> 00:06:34.856
Uh, what?!

00:06:34.956 --> 00:06:36.325
For your boyfriend?

00:06:36.425 --> 00:06:38.530
No! Um, uh...

00:06:38.631 --> 00:06:41.603
I put too much flour!
What should I do?!

00:06:41.703 --> 00:06:44.341
That's my clumsy girl.

00:06:44.441 --> 00:06:46.078
[Girl 1] You're
kidding. Seriously?

00:06:46.178 --> 00:06:48.517
[Girl 2] Seriously, she
went to the faculty
office to greet them.

00:06:48.617 --> 00:06:53.159
Hey, Momo-chan. It's me,
Megu. Long time no talk.

00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:55.831
Yeah, it's near the agency.

00:06:55.932 --> 00:06:58.604
[Students talking
and gasping in awe]

00:06:58.704 --> 00:07:01.175
[Megumi] Yeah, that's
right. Anyway...

00:07:01.275 --> 00:07:04.916
I found the perfect
place, so I moved.

00:07:06.252 --> 00:07:08.557
Talk to you later.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:11.195
'Kay! See ya. Thanks a lot!

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.301
[Nakanishi] Yamato!
[Yamato] Hm?

00:07:14.401 --> 00:07:15.470
[Nakanishi] Yamato, Yamato!

00:07:15.571 --> 00:07:17.341
Have you heard? This is huge!

00:07:17.441 --> 00:07:18.644
Huh?

00:07:18.744 --> 00:07:20.514
It's Megu-tan! Megu-tan!

00:07:20.615 --> 00:07:22.552
Calm down. What's Megu-tan?

00:07:22.652 --> 00:07:25.925
You don't know who Megu-tan
is?! Give me a break!

00:07:26.025 --> 00:07:28.998
[Nakanishi] Feast
your eyes, baby!
[Yamato] Hey!

00:07:29.098 --> 00:07:31.435
[Nakanishi] Dessert's top
model, Megumi Kitagawa,

00:07:31.536 --> 00:07:34.809
is transferring to our
school, Yamato, you dunce!

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:41.823
Yamato?

00:07:41.923 --> 00:07:44.161
M-Megu-tan?

00:07:47.301 --> 00:07:48.637
Good afternoon.

00:07:50.741 --> 00:07:52.812
[Asami] Megu-tan, your
face is so small.

00:07:52.912 --> 00:07:54.248
[Boy 1] Are you really
transferring here?

00:07:54.348 --> 00:07:55.618
[Nakanishi] You're so thin!

00:07:55.718 --> 00:07:57.287
[Boy 2] Have you already
been assigned a class?

00:07:57.387 --> 00:08:00.260
Hey, would you like to exchange
cell numbers with me, Megu-tan?

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.732
You just can't ask
her to do that, idiot.

00:08:02.832 --> 00:08:05.571
Sorry you guys. I-I hate
to break the news to you,

00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:09.579
but I don't have anymore
room in my contacts.

00:08:09.679 --> 00:08:12.652
Maybe another time.

00:08:12.752 --> 00:08:15.323
Can you send me postcards
and letters?

00:08:15.423 --> 00:08:16.793
Sure.

00:08:27.114 --> 00:08:30.453
[Girl 1] Can you believe
it? Megu-tan transferred
to our school!

00:08:30.554 --> 00:08:32.525
[Girl 2] Think she can
get us into a photoshoot?

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:34.929
[Megumi] Yamato-kun.

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:37.502
Huh? Kitaigawa.

00:08:37.602 --> 00:08:39.471
I know this is kind of sudden.

00:08:39.572 --> 00:08:42.044
Yamato-kun, are you spoken for?

00:08:42.144 --> 00:08:43.279
[Yamato] What?

00:08:44.516 --> 00:08:47.287
Of course you've got
a girlfriend, my bad.

00:08:47.387 --> 00:08:48.724
Huh?

00:08:50.694 --> 00:08:53.099
Let me be direct about this.

00:08:53.199 --> 00:08:55.470
I want to have a relationship
with you as well,

00:08:55.571 --> 00:08:57.742
if you don't mind.

00:08:57.842 --> 00:09:01.650
I'm a believer in love
at first sight, Kurosawa.

00:09:03.887 --> 00:09:07.862
I feel like my prince
has appeared out of some
storybook fantasy.

00:09:07.962 --> 00:09:11.536
I want you to walk by my side,
like the prince that you are.

00:09:11.636 --> 00:09:18.182
I don't care if you're already
dating someone else.

00:09:18.282 --> 00:09:22.558
The two of us would be seriously
awesome as a couple.

00:09:22.658 --> 00:09:24.629
Since we're both stars and all.

00:09:29.037 --> 00:09:30.206
Not happening.

00:09:31.910 --> 00:09:34.682
So you know, girls who only
care about their looks and

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:37.187
their appearance
just turn me off.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.567
Hey Mei!

00:09:44.736 --> 00:09:45.905
I've been waiting for you.

00:09:46.005 --> 00:09:49.779
Sorry. I was on cleaning duty.

00:09:49.879 --> 00:09:52.752
It's all good. Let's go.

00:09:53.286 --> 00:09:54.756
[Mei] Okay.

00:10:30.293 --> 00:10:32.330
[Megumi] I'm sorry!

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:36.238
I'm really sorry for acting all
obnoxious with you yesterday.

00:10:36.338 --> 00:10:41.983
I really didn't know you
had a serious girlfriend.
Ah, this is...

00:10:42.083 --> 00:10:45.591
Awkward. I hope you can
see me from now on as just

00:10:45.691 --> 00:10:48.462
another one of your
regular classmates.

00:10:48.564 --> 00:10:50.734
If that's okay with you, I mean.

00:10:50.835 --> 00:10:53.172
I'm hoping I can be a
friend to both of you.

00:10:53.272 --> 00:10:55.544
Oh, uh...

00:10:55.644 --> 00:10:57.380
I don't mind, really.

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.917
[Yamato] Yeah.

00:10:59.017 --> 00:11:02.224
I was a little tough on
you yesterday. I'm sorry.

00:11:02.324 --> 00:11:03.760
Oh, that's awesome!

00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.800
You can't imagine how much
of a relief that is to me!

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:09.238
What happened between
you guys anyway?

00:11:09.338 --> 00:11:10.608
Yeah, spill it!

00:11:10.708 --> 00:11:12.745
Nothing worth losing
any sleep over.

00:11:12.845 --> 00:11:14.549
Ask Yamato-kun about it.

00:11:14.649 --> 00:11:16.485
What?

00:11:16.586 --> 00:11:20.026
What happened, Yamato? Tell me!

00:11:31.115 --> 00:11:34.454
[Yamato] Aren't you curious
about what happened?

00:11:34.556 --> 00:11:36.626
[Mei] Huh?

00:11:36.726 --> 00:11:39.599
Um, did something happen?

00:11:39.699 --> 00:11:41.402
[Yamato] Nothing
worth mentioning.

00:11:42.905 --> 00:11:44.642
[Mei] Okay, then.

00:11:44.742 --> 00:11:47.047
[Yamato] You shouldn't
accept it so easily.

00:11:47.147 --> 00:11:48.449
[Mei] What?

00:11:50.119 --> 00:11:54.461
Well, it really was
nothing, so it's fine.

00:12:31.001 --> 00:12:33.272
[Megumi giggles] Tachibana-san.

00:12:34.542 --> 00:12:36.613
Good morning ladies.

00:12:36.713 --> 00:12:39.819
Oh, Megu-tan, your
uniform arrived!

00:12:39.919 --> 00:12:44.094
It sure did. I'm so glad we
finally match. Sweet right?

00:12:44.194 --> 00:12:46.599
It looks super cute
on you, Megu-tan!

00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.102
[Asami] Right?
[Mei] Mmhmm.

00:12:48.202 --> 00:12:50.841
Oh, I need to go
back to my classroom.

00:12:50.941 --> 00:12:54.481
Hold on. Doesn't class
D have biology next?

00:12:54.582 --> 00:12:56.018
Don't you have to change rooms?

00:12:56.118 --> 00:12:58.857
I didn't know that.
Where's the biology lab?

00:12:58.957 --> 00:13:00.527
[Asami gasp]
[Megumi] Huh?

00:13:00.628 --> 00:13:04.067
Yamato, Megu-tan doesn't
know where all the
classrooms are yet.

00:13:04.167 --> 00:13:06.673
Would you mind
showing her around?

00:13:06.773 --> 00:13:08.543
[Yamato] Yeah, sure.

00:13:09.277 --> 00:13:10.313
Oh, you will?

00:13:10.413 --> 00:13:12.083
Thanks a lot, Yamato-kun!

00:13:12.183 --> 00:13:14.789
[Girl 1] It's Megu-tan.
She's so pretty.

00:13:14.889 --> 00:13:16.425
We need to hurry up.

00:13:16.526 --> 00:13:17.494
Uh, yeah.

00:13:17.595 --> 00:13:20.266
See you later.

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:21.468
See you guys later!

00:13:21.569 --> 00:13:23.774
[Girl 2] She and Kurosawa
look so normal together.

00:13:23.874 --> 00:13:26.378
[Girl 3] I know, right? They
have this aura together.

00:13:26.478 --> 00:13:29.519
[Girl 4] Isn't it amazing just
thinking about them together?

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:37.067
[Megumi] Sorry. I just
moved here, so my only
friend is Momo-chan.

00:13:37.167 --> 00:13:39.104
People won't really talk to me.

00:13:39.204 --> 00:13:42.243
I mean, talk to me
like I'm just me.

00:13:42.344 --> 00:13:44.414
Ha, I don't think
they can help it.

00:13:44.515 --> 00:13:48.523
It's a little intimidating
having a magazine model sharing
a classroom with them.

00:13:48.623 --> 00:13:51.362
What? But I'm not
that big a star.

00:13:51.462 --> 00:13:55.537
But you know, you could totally
be a model, if you wanted to.

00:13:55.637 --> 00:13:58.643
Oh that's right! My agency's
totally looking for

00:13:58.744 --> 00:14:02.117
a hot new guy to put up in front
of a magazine like Dessert.

00:14:02.217 --> 00:14:03.152
No. No way.

00:14:03.252 --> 00:14:04.689
Don't knock it till you try it.

00:14:04.789 --> 00:14:08.062
You'd be one of the top names
in the business in no time.

00:14:08.162 --> 00:14:09.197
[Yamato] Still not doin' it.

00:14:09.297 --> 00:14:12.170
[Megumi] Why not? What a waste.

00:14:12.838 --> 00:14:14.174
[Kitchen timer dings]

00:14:37.655 --> 00:14:39.224
Ah, it's brittle!

00:14:40.994 --> 00:14:44.101
I guess I'm past the
weaponized cookies phase.

00:14:44.201 --> 00:14:46.138
Now it's time for
the taste test.

00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:00.868
No taste... at all!

00:15:00.968 --> 00:15:05.978
<i>[Nagi] I guess you could</i>
<i>say I put my heart into</i>
<i>everything I make.</i>

00:15:06.078 --> 00:15:09.084
I'm trying to do that,
but it won't work!

00:15:19.605 --> 00:15:21.442
[Marshmellow growls in digust]

00:15:22.912 --> 00:15:24.816
You too, kitty?

00:15:24.916 --> 00:15:27.454
Not trying to kill
the cat, are you?

00:15:28.723 --> 00:15:31.094
Well, don't let
it get you down.

00:15:35.203 --> 00:15:37.407
[Nakanishi] What?!
[Asami] You're gonna
be a model?!

00:15:37.508 --> 00:15:40.848
No, it's not like I'm
gonna do it full-time.

00:15:40.948 --> 00:15:42.585
I'm just filling
in for the day.

00:15:42.685 --> 00:15:45.223
[Asami] What do you mean?
[Yamato] Kitagawa's agency

00:15:45.323 --> 00:15:48.530
[Yamato] is in trouble
because they don't have
enough male models,

00:15:48.630 --> 00:15:50.233
so I couldn't refuse.

00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:53.607
I mean, one day shouldn't
mess up my schedule too much.

00:15:53.707 --> 00:15:56.613
I know you're gonna make
a great model, Yamato-kun.

00:15:56.713 --> 00:15:58.315
[Asami] Wow, you're so lucky!

00:15:58.415 --> 00:16:00.888
So they'll do makeup and
take pictures of you?

00:16:00.988 --> 00:16:05.129
[Megumi] Yep! Hey, would
you guys be interested
in seeing the studio?

00:16:05.229 --> 00:16:07.000
[Yamato] What? Hey, Kitagawa...

00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:08.035
[Nakanishi &amp; Asami] What?!

00:16:08.135 --> 00:16:09.705
Yes! We'd love to see it!

00:16:09.806 --> 00:16:13.245
[Nakanishi] Hardly anyone
gets to watch Megu-tan work.

00:16:13.345 --> 00:16:16.485
[Yamato] Hold on... You'll
get in the way of the staff.

00:16:16.586 --> 00:16:17.822
[Megumi] No, they won't.

00:16:17.922 --> 00:16:20.226
We have people come
watch all the time.

00:16:20.326 --> 00:16:23.432
[Asami] Aw yeah! We're in!
[Yamato] Seriously?

00:16:23.533 --> 00:16:26.739
[Megumi] Mei-chan, you'll
come, too, won't you?

00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:28.743
You comin', right?

00:16:28.844 --> 00:16:32.483
[Mei] Mmhmm.
[Yamato] Wha-what?
You're coming, too?

00:16:32.585 --> 00:16:35.423
Unless you don't want
me to, Kurosawa.

00:16:35.524 --> 00:16:39.832
No, I don't mind you being
there, it's just that it'll
be embarrassing...

00:16:39.932 --> 00:16:42.036
[Megumi] Anyway, Yamato-kun.

00:16:42.136 --> 00:16:47.681
Someone from my agency wants to
meet you before the shoot to go
over the ground rules with you.

00:16:47.781 --> 00:16:49.852
Are you free after school today?

00:16:49.952 --> 00:16:53.660
Well... I usually
walk home with Mei.

00:16:55.898 --> 00:16:58.703
Don't let me get in your way.
It sounds like an important

00:16:58.803 --> 00:17:01.943
meeting, so maybe you should
go ahead and meet them.

00:17:02.043 --> 00:17:04.114
[Megumi] Thanks,
Mei-chan! Sorry.

00:17:04.214 --> 00:17:08.757
[Yamato] Are you sure?
[Mei] We don't have to walk
home together every day.

00:17:08.857 --> 00:17:10.192
It's fine with me, really.

00:17:10.293 --> 00:17:12.130
[Megumi] My agency's president
saw a picture of you,

00:17:12.230 --> 00:17:15.671
and he likes you. He won't stop
talking about meeting you.

00:17:15.771 --> 00:17:17.240
Sorry.

00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:19.444
[Yamato] Well, I guess I can go.

00:17:19.545 --> 00:17:21.148
[Megumi] Great!

00:17:37.413 --> 00:17:41.288
<i>It's been a while since</i>
<i>I walked home by myself.</i>

00:17:41.388 --> 00:17:45.429
<i>I've been going with Kurosawa</i>
<i>all the time lately.</i>

00:17:46.833 --> 00:17:50.339
<i>Every step feels so long...</i>

00:18:11.381 --> 00:18:15.456
<i>Why am I having these thoughts?</i>

00:18:31.556 --> 00:18:33.893
Today's theme is
lovers on a date.

00:18:33.994 --> 00:18:35.998
Try to show some movement.

00:18:36.098 --> 00:18:38.435
Okay. Show some movement.

00:18:39.572 --> 00:18:41.643
[Editor] Thoughts? Too bright?

00:18:41.743 --> 00:18:44.347
[Cameraman] Should we
change the lighting?

00:18:44.447 --> 00:18:46.586
[Stylist] Why don't we start
with her holding a bag?

00:18:46.686 --> 00:18:49.424
This is amazing. They're
so professional.

00:18:49.525 --> 00:18:51.461
You suppose they're ready yet?

00:18:51.562 --> 00:18:53.566
I'm sure they will be soon.

00:18:53.667 --> 00:18:55.871
[Stylist] Megumi-chan's
good to go.

00:18:56.973 --> 00:18:59.477
Let's have a great
shoot everyone!

00:19:03.152 --> 00:19:05.991
Wow! Megu-tan, you're so cute!

00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.528
Hey! You guys Made it!

00:19:07.628 --> 00:19:10.634
[Asami] Yeah! You
look so pretty!
[Megumi] Thanks a lot!

00:19:10.734 --> 00:19:11.903
You really are amazing.

00:19:12.003 --> 00:19:13.405
It's like you have
a special aura.

00:19:13.506 --> 00:19:14.975
Mmhmm!

00:19:15.076 --> 00:19:17.347
[Megumi] Do you really think so?
[Nakanishi] Yeah, for sure!

00:19:17.447 --> 00:19:19.552
[Asami] Yeah, for sure!
[Stylist] Yamato-kun is ready.

00:19:21.956 --> 00:19:23.325
[Asami] Wow!
[Nakanishi] Whoa!

00:19:34.481 --> 00:19:36.753
Whoa! You really showed up!

00:19:36.853 --> 00:19:38.022
This is so embarrassing...

00:19:38.122 --> 00:19:40.326
Look at that wild hairdo!

00:19:56.291 --> 00:20:00.901
Uh, um, what should I be doing?

00:20:01.001 --> 00:20:04.942
Imagine you're with someone
you like... on a date.

00:20:07.715 --> 00:20:10.219
[Cameraman] That's
it! Adorable, guys!

00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:12.958
Come on! We're supposed
to be having fun!

00:20:16.866 --> 00:20:17.835
Right?

00:20:17.935 --> 00:20:19.872
Uh, s-sure thing.

00:20:22.611 --> 00:20:24.548
[Megumi] Yamato-kun,
you're a natural!

00:20:24.648 --> 00:20:26.519
[Yamato] Really? You think so?

00:20:26.619 --> 00:20:29.124
[Megumi] Really! I would know.

00:20:29.224 --> 00:20:31.562
[Cameraman] Good!
Perfect! That is it!

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:36.405
[Asami] Yamato looks
like a real model.

00:20:36.506 --> 00:20:39.444
[Nakanishi] Yeah. They
look like a real couple...

00:20:39.545 --> 00:20:43.419
Uh, I mean, in that scenario.

00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:46.491
[Cameraman] Get closer
together. Try holding hands.

00:20:46.592 --> 00:20:49.665
Yeah, like ya know
each other! Oh!

00:20:55.811 --> 00:20:57.648
[Editor] Those two
make a perfect couple.

00:20:57.748 --> 00:21:00.720
No doubt about it.
Those two are awesome.

00:21:00.821 --> 00:21:03.392
[Editor] Megu-tan's
super into it today.

00:21:03.492 --> 00:21:06.298
[Manager] Even I'm gettin'
giddy over here.

00:21:06.398 --> 00:21:08.035
[Editor] Yeah, I
know what you mean.

<i>Why?</i>

For some reason, I've felt
anxious since Yamato's
modeling debut.

00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.968
I definitely shouldn't be like
this! Cheerful, be cheerful!

00:23:38.068 --> 00:23:39.538
Yay! I'm so happy!

00:23:39.638 --> 00:23:41.007
I feel even sadder now...

when you feel sad, meow.
