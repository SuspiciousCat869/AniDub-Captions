That's weird.

00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,625
Is he taking a cold bath again?

4
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:17,916
I haven't seen him do that
since summer started.

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,625
Hey. Coming in, bro.

Uh, how long are you
plannin' to marinate

00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,416
You really scared the
crap out of me back there.

00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:10,333
[NAGISA giggles]
I couldn't help myself. Sorry.

Yes, you could've!

[REI]
I'm confused.

16
00:02:12,625 --> 00:02:14,333
What were you doing
at Haru's place?

17
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,625
[MAKOTO] I think he slept
over there last night.

18
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:17,625
Isn't that right?

19

00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,125
[NAGISA]
Huh?

00:03:01,208 --> 00:03:04,541
Uh... Ha, ha. Um,

33
00:03:04,625 --> 00:03:07,083
Well, I'm here to see
the Leonid meteor shower!

34
00:03:07,166 --> 00:03:08,250
That's fine, but you
really shouldn't

35
00:03:08,333 --> 00:03:09,583
start a fire out here.

36
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,458
Oh. Of course. Silly me.

37
00:03:12,541 --> 00:03:14,291
[HARUKA] So I decided to
let him stay the night.

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:15,958
Yeah, it was really nice of him.

39
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:18,458
The Leonid Media Shower's
not 'til the fall though.

Huh? Oh!

Must've had my dates wrong.
That's classic me!

Guys.

43
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,333
How 'bout stepping things up
at practice today?

44
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,291
I figure if we work harder
it can only increase

45
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:30,166
our chances of winning.
Are you in?

Well, you look more toned

Great job, everybody!

[MAKOTO] Wow, I can't believe
how late it is already.

Ugh, my arms feel like Jelly
from paddling so hard today.

[MAKOTO laughs] You'll get
used to it after a while.

But, It looks like
Haru likes fin practice

75

better than paddling.

wrong with him.

doesn't want to talk.

I want to be a penguin keeper.

A treasure hunter.

125
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,708
Or a deep sea explorer.

126
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,750
But, I also want
to travel the world,

127
00:06:20,833 --> 00:06:23,041
so a tour guide would be
a pretty awesome job.

128
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,416
Ugh. It's not fair that we
have to choose just one thing.

You're smart.
You're a great cook.

You're good with your hands too.

And you're a really
talented artist.

best swimmer I've ever seen!

I bet you could be a

No thanks.

expected that.

Well?

[NAGISA]
Huh?

147

[HARUKA] You gonna tell me
why you came to my house

Well, I told ya, I'm here
for the meteor shower.

00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:08,750
Yeah, but it's not
until the fall.

00:07:08,833 --> 00:07:12,791
Uh. No, you're right.

It's the middle of the night.

161
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:29,125
[NAGISA] You know what they say:
no time like the present!

162
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,250
[MAKOTO]
Uh-- Haru?

163
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:31,666
[NAGISA gasps]

164
00:07:34,666 --> 00:07:37,208
Dude, tell us what happened.

165
00:07:40,125 --> 00:07:42,125
[HARUKA, MAKOTO]
You ran away?

166
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:43,833
[NAGISA]
Yeah.

167
00:07:43,916 --> 00:07:45,916
Why'd you do it?

168
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,458
[NAGISA]
Just 'cause.

169
00:07:47,541 --> 00:07:50,333
Please don't ask me anything
else, I just wanna stay over!

170
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:51,291
Come on!

171
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:53,958
[MAKOTO]
Mm... I can't.

172
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,166
But why not?

173
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:57,208
You can't stay over
without telling us why,

174
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,000
I'm sorry but it's
just the way it is.

175
00:07:59,083 --> 00:08:00,250
[NAGISA]
Come on, Haru.

176
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:02,333
Don't be like that!

177
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,125
Look, we said "no,"
and we meant it. So--

178
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:07,625
[NAGISA]
Please!

179
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:12,791
[NAGISA]
Please...

180
00:08:17,375 --> 00:08:19,916
[HARUKA]
Yes. Bye.

181
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,166
[MAKOTO sighs]
Were you on the phone?

182
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,333
Yeah. How is he?

183
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,583
Not good.

184
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,750
He still doesn't want
to talk about anything.

185
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,583
Ah! Hey guys!
Where is Nagisa?

186
00:08:30,666 --> 00:08:32,208
I want to see him
right this instant!

187
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,125
Rei. Just calm down, okay?

188
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:35,708
[REI]
Fine. Where is he?

189
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,833
Don't worry. He's all right.
He's in the living room.

190
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:40,333
[MAKOTO] The bad news is,
he doesn't wanna

191
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,125
tell us what happened.

192
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:44,750
I'm guessing he's been
gone since yesterday.

193
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:46,750
[HARUKA]
Yeah, you're probably right.

194
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:48,166
[REI]
This is insane.

195
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:49,708
But I suppose it
does explain why

196
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:52,500
he's been acting
so strange lately.

197
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:53,708
[MAKOTO]
You know what's weird?

198
00:08:53,791 --> 00:08:55,083
He never talks about his family.

199
00:08:55,166 --> 00:08:56,500
[REI]
Yeah, that's true.

200
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,958
[HARUKA] I've never even heard
him mention them before.

201
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,041
[MAKOTO sighs]
Well, standing around waiting

202
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:03,875
isn't gonna do us any good.

203
00:09:03,958 --> 00:09:05,750
I'll go see if I
can get him to talk.

204
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:07,500
He'll probably be more
comfortable if we have

205
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,333
the conversation
one on one, don't you think?

206
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,416
That's a great idea.

207
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,083
We'll leave the
talking to you, Makoto.

208
00:09:12,166 --> 00:09:13,583
Here's hoping it goes well.

209
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,416
Thanks.

210
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:17,750
[MAKOTO]
Nagisa. I'm comin' in.

211
00:09:20,083 --> 00:09:21,833
I feel bad for Nagisa! Dudes!

212
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,625
He said he's being taken away
to the supercountry Pangea!

213
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:25,708
We can't just let him go!

214
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,500
We have to do
something, you guys!

215
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:28,750
What are you talking about?

216
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,416
That's not even a real place!

217
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:31,708
[MAKOTO]
Huh? It's not?

218
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,875
Of course not!

219
00:09:32,958 --> 00:09:34,458
How can you let him
trick you like that?

220
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,875
--I was tricked?!
--Yes!

221
00:09:35,958 --> 00:09:37,333
[HARUKA sighs]

222
00:09:37,416 --> 00:09:38,708
All right, it's my turn.

223
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:40,000
Uh-- Huh?

224
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,500
Good luck, Haru.
You're our only hope.

225
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,083
[HARUKA]
Nagisa. Pull up some floor.

226
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,375
I've decided to
let him stay with me.

227
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:53,833
Dude, why did you
let him bribe you?

228
00:09:53,916 --> 00:09:55,041
Argh.

229
00:09:55,125 --> 00:09:56,916
I can't trust you guys
to handle anything!

230
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:58,333
I'll take care of this.

231
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:01,541
No one can resist my enhanced
negotiation techniques.

232
00:10:01,625 --> 00:10:02,750
Back in a flash.

233
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:03,333
Rei.

234
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:04,875
I'm not Rei.

235
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,916
You guys can call me
"The Negotiator."

236
00:10:09,750 --> 00:10:12,625
I know who's to blame.
You're welcome!

237
00:10:12,708 --> 00:10:14,583
[MAKOTO]
For what?

238
00:10:16,458 --> 00:10:18,333
[HARUKA]
Please. Tell us what's going on.

239
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,875
Yeah, why would you
decide to run away?

240
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,333
[MAKOTO sighs]
We're all just

241
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,125
really worried
about you, Nagisa.

242
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:28,541
We can't help you if you
won't tell us what happened.

243
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,791
He's right.

244
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:31,458
[NAGISA]
Mako. Haru...

245
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:34,041
I don't understand, is the
problem that you don't trust us?

246
00:10:34,125 --> 00:10:36,000
Ngh! No!

247
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,458
[NAGISA]
You guys,

248
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:40,791
I'm sorry to make you
worry about me.

249
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:43,041
You're right.
You deserve to know.

250
00:10:43,125 --> 00:10:45,583
The truth is...

251
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:46,916
See.

252
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,708
Because of some personal issues,
I might be forced

253
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,916
to quit the Swim Club.

254
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,958
[REI, HARUKA, MAKOTO gasp]

255
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,375
I don't understand.

256
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,666
The thing is, my grades
were pretty horrendous

257
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:57,333
on my midterm exams.

258
00:10:57,416 --> 00:11:00,166
My mom and dad are extremely
strict about academic stuff.

259
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:02,250
So they told me I had
to give up swimming.

260
00:11:02,333 --> 00:11:05,458
I can't just quit Swim Club
though. I love it too much.

261
00:11:05,541 --> 00:11:08,250
So I decided to pack my things
and run away from home.

262
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,125
Well, what if you got
your grades back up?

263
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:11,208
Then you wouldn't
have to quit, right?

264
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:12,458
That's no big deal.

265
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:14,041
I'll help you study till
you're back on track.

266
00:11:14,125 --> 00:11:15,541
You can tell your parents that!

267
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:17,166
Look, you don't get it,
once my parents

268
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:18,333
have their mind made up.

269
00:11:18,416 --> 00:11:20,250
They don't go back on it,
no matter what.

270
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,333
But, if you just sit down
and try to talk to them--

271
00:11:22,416 --> 00:11:26,291
[NAGISA] They won't listen
to me, they never do!

272
00:11:26,375 --> 00:11:28,958
Seriously?

273
00:11:29,041 --> 00:11:30,125
[MAKOTO]
C'mon.

274
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:32,166
There's gotta be another way.

275
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,375
[NAGISA]
Yeah.

276
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,208
I don't know what else
to do, though.

277
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:37,833
[REI]
Nagisa...

278
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:40,000
I guess by you running off
like this, you're hoping they'll

279
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:41,916
change their mind
about you swimming?

280
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,208
That's what you're
thinking, am I right?

281
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,000
Yeah.

282
00:11:45,083 --> 00:11:46,375
Rei?

283
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:47,958
I'm sorry, but there's
no way that's going to work.

284
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,333
We need to seek out
other options.

285
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,333
I don't necessarily know
what those might be,

286
00:11:52,416 --> 00:11:53,916
but I know this isn't feasible.

287
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,166
Even if you could get them to
let you stay in the Swim Club,

288
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:58,458
you wouldn't be at your
best living like this!

289
00:11:58,541 --> 00:11:59,791
[NAGISA gasps]

290
00:11:59,875 --> 00:12:02,250
All right. Let's leave
it at that.

291
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:04,833
[phone chimes]

292
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:06,583
[NAGISA gasps]

293
00:12:06,666 --> 00:12:07,750
What is it?

294
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:09,708
It's from my sister.
She says that my mom

295
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:10,791
is coming here to bring me home!

296
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:11,791
[REI, MAKOTO gasp]

297
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:13,333
I'm freaking out!
What do I do?

298
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:14,916
This is bad!

299
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,916
We have to come up with a plan
and we have to do it quickly!

300
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,416
Guys, what if she forces
me to come home now?

301
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,625
[HARUKA] For the time being,
let's all just calm down.

302
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,666
Haru?

303
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,166
Come on.

304
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,083
[MAKOTO] Guess this is the
only place we have left to go.

305
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,958
[REI] Yeah, it's not like
we can go to school.

306
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,125
[MAKOTO]
You're right about that.

307
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:30,875
Good thing we got a key.

308
00:12:34,166 --> 00:12:35,583
I'm sorry!

309
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,958
I didn't mean to get
you involved in this.

310
00:12:38,041 --> 00:12:39,208
Don't be sorry.

311
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,791
Little too late for that.

312
00:12:40,875 --> 00:12:41,958
Indeed.

313
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,000
What matters now is that
we stick together.

314
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,125
[HARUKA] We'd better keep
moving, we could be seen here.

315
00:12:51,208 --> 00:12:52,583
[REI] True, we should head
to the locker rooms

316
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:53,416

[MAKOTO]
What? No! No way!

318
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:58,208
It's so dark and scary!
That place could be haunted!

319

Don't be ridiculous.
You know ghosts aren't real!

320
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:01,875
Way to go, if there is a ghost,

321
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,250
you probably just
pissed him off!

[HARUKA]
Makoto, keep your voice down.

[MAKOTO]
Oops. My bad.

324

[REI] Let's hide here instead,
it's our smartest option.

325
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,250
All right. Here's the deal.

326
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,375
In order to get out of this,
you need to improve your grades.

327
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:13,750
And then hope for the best.

328

Uh. Yeah, that would be
the standard plan of attack.

[REI]
Level with me here.

330
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:19,541
How bad were your grades

331
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,583
that your parents were
gonna make you quit?

332
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,333
That one is good.

333
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:29,958
But the rest are atrocious.

[NAGISA laughs nervously]
[MAKOTO groans]

335
00:13:31,666 --> 00:13:32,916
[MAKOTO]
Hey.

336
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,666
Didn't you go to a private
school for junior high?

337
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:36,958
[NAGISA]
Yeah. It was a prep school.

338
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,208
[REI]
And you know.

339
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,625
I don't remember your
grades being this bad

340
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:41,500
when we were freshman together.

341
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,083
So what's the deal?

342
00:13:43,166 --> 00:13:44,333
I don't know.

343
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,958
[NAGISA] It's probably
because I hate studying.

344
00:13:47,041 --> 00:13:48,666
[REI]
You hate it?

345
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,166
I bet you just weren't
focused enough.

346
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,750
[NAGISA]
No, that's not it.

347
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:55,500
Before I ran away,
I was miserable.

348
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,541
[NAGISA] The only reason
I took the junior high exams

349
00:13:59,625 --> 00:14:02,166
in the first place, is because
my parents forced me.

350
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:05,208
They decided I should continue
on with my education so I could

351
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:08,500
get into a college and get
a steady, dependable job.

352
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:12,541
That's just how things
are at my house.

353
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:17,000
You study, you to college,
you get a job.

354
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,166
When I was in junior high,
they made me study all the time.

355
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,875
But there wasn't a
single thing fun about it.

356
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,833
After a while,
I lost sight of why

357
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:27,375
I was studying to begin with.

358
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:29,875
I just couldn't focus, y'know?

359
00:14:29,958 --> 00:14:33,583
Studying became like
some kind of torture.

360
00:14:33,666 --> 00:14:36,083
My parents couldn't stand
to see me like that.

361
00:14:36,166 --> 00:14:39,166
So they sent me to Iwatobi
hoping I'd snap out of it.

362
00:14:39,250 --> 00:14:41,166
Which turned out to be a
blessing in disguise because

363
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,625
I was able to swim
whenever I wanted.

364
00:14:43,708 --> 00:14:45,250
Yeah, but why Iwatobi?

365
00:14:45,333 --> 00:14:46,958
[HARUKA] I mean, it's not like
we're the only school around

366
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:49,875
that has a Swimming Club, right?

367
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:55,375
[NAGISA]
Well... That's an easy one.

368
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,250
I wanted to be at
Iwatobi so I could swim

369
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,458
with you and Haru again.
And then, I met Rei,

370
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,916
and that made swimming
that much more of a pleasure.

371
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,083
For me, swimming's
the highlight of my day.

372
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:06,916
It's the only part of my
life that makes sense.

373
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,833
It's my one true joy.

374
00:15:11,291 --> 00:15:12,833
[NAGISA] But when my parents
told me I had to quit,

375
00:15:12,916 --> 00:15:14,041
I lost my mind.

376
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,833
It's like I couldn't
think straight anymore.

377
00:15:15,916 --> 00:15:17,750
Just the thought of having
to go back to my life

378
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,375
the way it was before
honestly terrified me.

379
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,750
So that's why you
decided to run away?

380
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,083
[NAGISA]
Yeah.

381
00:15:24,166 --> 00:15:26,083
[REI] Have you told your
parents this, Nagisa?

382
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:28,000
Do they know how you
really feel about it?

383

Huh? No, they don't.

I don't think they would listen.

can't keep silent anymore!

472
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,458
I always did what I was told!

473
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:03,666
But no matter what,
it was never fun!

474
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:07,291
The reason I ran away is
because I'm weak and afraid!

475
00:19:07,375 --> 00:19:09,750
Too afraid to be
honest with you!

476
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:11,791
I know that it was
wrong of me to give up

477
00:19:11,875 --> 00:19:13,333
before I ever tried.

478
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,375
So, from now on, I'm not gonna
run away from my problems!

479
00:19:16,458 --> 00:19:19,416
I'm gonna face them!
No matter what!

480
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,291
[NAGISA]
Haru...

481
00:19:21,375 --> 00:19:23,291
Mako...

482
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:25,750
And Rei, too.

483
00:19:25,833 --> 00:19:29,041
I wanna swim with them!
Let me swim with my friends!

484
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:31,291
Mother!

485
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:34,208
I want you to listen
to what I say-- Uh?

486
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:38,791
[NAGISA, REI, MAKOTO gasp]

487
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,875
[MAKOTO]
It's Miss Amakata.

488
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:41,416
[AMAKATA]
Mr. Hazuki.

489
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:46,000
There is a very old saying.
"Raising children isn't easy."

490
00:19:48,958 --> 00:19:50,833
[AMAKATA] Your parents
are worried about you.

491
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:52,958
Go see them.

492
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:01,791
[AMAKATA]
Sorry, everyone.

493
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:04,208
My timing was a little
awkward, wasn't it?

494
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,333
I'm confused,
how did you even know?

495
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,833
She knows 'cause I told her.

496
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,125
[MAKOTO]
What?

497
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:10,958
Yeah, he called and
told me what was going on.

498
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:14,333
He also assured me you'd take
care of Nagisa 'til I arrived.

499
00:20:14,416 --> 00:20:15,583
Haru...

500
00:20:15,666 --> 00:20:16,583
I'm sneaky.

501
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:17,791
[REI, MAKOTO laugh]

502
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:18,791
[HARUKA] But when the
car first pulled up,

503
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,416
I honestly wasn't
sure who it was.

504
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:21,833
Thanks a lot.

505
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:23,166
Listen to me.

506
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,125
You need to confront your
parents in a kind manner

507
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:28,000
and tell them how you feel.
And if that doesn't work?

508
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,166
Then, we'll figure
something out.

509
00:20:33,083 --> 00:20:34,666
I'll tell them!

510
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:36,500
[MAKOTO]
Well. Should we go?

511
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:37,375
[HARUKA]
Sounds good.

512
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:38,208
[NAGISA]
Huh?

513
00:20:38,291 --> 00:20:39,625
Are you coming or not?

514
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,833
You are gonna tell
your parents, aren't you?

515
00:20:41,916 --> 00:20:43,583
Uh. Well yeah, I am.

516
00:20:43,666 --> 00:20:44,958
[REI] What they're
trying to say is that

517
00:20:45,041 --> 00:20:47,500
we're gonna go with you.
I mean let's be honest,

518
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:50,333
it's not like we can afford
to lose any Swim Club members.

519
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,583
Besides. You're the person
who forced me to join

520
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,625
the Swim Club in the
first place, remember?

521
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:57,416
You can't quit. I won't let you.

522
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,041
[MAKOTO]
C'mon, let's go.

523
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,583
[HARUKA]
You coming?

524
00:21:03,666 --> 00:21:06,666
Uh. Right. Wait for me, guys!

525
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,750
[GOU gasps]
That happened?

526
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:14,500
[NAGISA]
Sorry I didn't tell ya.

527
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:15,875
I was in a bad way.

528
00:21:15,958 --> 00:21:17,666
I'm just glad it worked out.

529
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,208
You were honest
with your parents

530
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,166
and so they let you stay
on the Swim Club.

531
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:24,000
[NAGISA] Mm-hm! Well,
that's only because I agreed

532
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,541
to study harder from now on.
Plus, they want me to go

533
00:21:26,625 --> 00:21:30,125
to Nationals 'cause they realize
how important it is to me now.

534
00:21:30,208 --> 00:21:31,750
Who knows, maybe I'll
surprise everyone

535
00:21:31,833 --> 00:21:33,750
this time around?

536
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:35,125
I guess that means
we're gonna have to

537
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,625
work our butts off, huh?

538
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:37,875
Certainly sounds like it!

539
00:21:37,958 --> 00:21:38,833
You can count me in.

540
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:39,750
[NAGISA]
All right then.

541
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,916
Lets get fired up and practice!

542
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,666
Nationals, we're on our way!

543
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:45,750
[IWATOBI CLUB]
Yeah!

544
00:21:45,833 --> 00:21:47,833
[BIRD 5A whisles]

545
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,416
[RIN] It's finally time for
the District tournament.

546
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:22,458
Let's all do our best!
What's wrong, Rei?

547
00:23:22,541 --> 00:23:24,250
[REI] Haru won't let go of
those cans of mackerel.

548
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,291
[HARUKA] These are no
ordinary mackerel cans.

549
00:23:26,375 --> 00:23:28,958
These are legendary cans which
use fresh mackerel, line-caught

550
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:31,500
on the border of the Pacific
Ocean and the Seto Inland Sea!

551
00:23:31,583 --> 00:23:32,333
[RIN]
Give 'em here!

552
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:33,500
[HARUKA grunts]

553
00:23:33,583 --> 00:23:35,125
[RIN] Next time:
"Prime of Invincibility!"

554
00:23:35,208 --> 00:23:36,708
[HARUKA]
Give them back, Rin!

555
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:38,791
[RIN] Haru, I'll tell you the
real legend of canned mackerel!

556
00:23:38,875 --> 00:23:40,166
Trust me on that one!
