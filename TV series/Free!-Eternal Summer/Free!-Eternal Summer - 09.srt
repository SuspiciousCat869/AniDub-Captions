1
00:00:13,125 --> 00:00:14,041
Holy...

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,458
This is insane!

00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:20,833
[NITORI gasps]

4
00:00:20,916 --> 00:00:23,000
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Whoa!

5
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,208
[SAMEZUKA 9A]
He broke Iwashimizu's record!

6
00:00:25,291 --> 00:00:27,333
All right! Way to
kill it, Nitori!

7
00:00:27,416 --> 00:00:29,166
Looks like someone's
coaching bumped our boy's

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:31,458
game up a notch.

9
00:00:31,541 --> 00:00:32,833
Shut up, man.

10
00:00:32,916 --> 00:00:34,750
[MOMOTARO]
You are now officially my idol!

11
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,291
I'm totally serious!

12
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:38,750
There's no way you're not going
to Regionals with that time!

13
00:00:38,833 --> 00:00:40,500
[NITORI] Whoa there champ,
you're gonna jinx me.

14
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,916
Nothing's written in stone yet.

15
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,083
Whatever! Dude, you gotta
let me in on your routine!

16
00:00:44,166 --> 00:00:46,416
It's like some kind of
super ultra-secret, huh?

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,416
Sosuke just gave me a few
pointers on the side,

18
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,000
that's all there was to it.

19
00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:53,458
Aww no fair, man!
I want some pointers!

20
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:54,750
Ugh. Just great.

21
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:55,916
[MOMOTARO]
C'mon! Please!

22
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,125
[RIN]
Ai.

23
00:00:57,208 --> 00:00:58,625
Don't let today go to your head,

24
00:00:58,708 --> 00:01:01,750
Regionals are still up in
the air. No gettin' comfortable.

25
00:01:01,833 --> 00:01:05,708
[NITORI laughs]
Yes, sir!

26
00:01:05,791 --> 00:01:07,458
[AMAKATA]
You're still practicing?

27
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,750
My goodness, it's so late.

28
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,333
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, but--

29
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,666
[AMAKATA] It's way past closing
time, the guidance counselor

30
00:01:11,750 --> 00:01:13,583
is going to blow a gasket
if he sees you boys here

31
00:01:13,666 --> 00:01:14,958
at this hour.

32
00:01:15,041 --> 00:01:16,500
We're comin' up on the
last week before Regionals.

33
00:01:16,583 --> 00:01:18,791
We gotta squeeze in
all the practice we can.

34
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,041
Our times are good, but the
exchanges need tweaking

35
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:22,500
if we expect to have a shot.

36
00:01:22,583 --> 00:01:24,000
Whaddya say we
give it another go?

37
00:01:24,083 --> 00:01:24,916
Sure.

38
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,083
[AMAKATA]
Exchanges?

39
00:01:26,166 --> 00:01:27,583
[MAKOTO]
Right.

40
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:29,250
Those milliseconds between
one guy touching the platform

41
00:01:29,333 --> 00:01:31,916
and the next one diving in.
Tightening up that trade-off

42
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,875
moment is what separates
the men from the boys.

43
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:38,833
[MAKOTO] The idea is to predict
your partner's end time.

44
00:01:38,916 --> 00:01:41,291
If you can anticipate the moment
he's gonna touch the platform

45
00:01:41,375 --> 00:01:43,875
without having to watch him,
you can tweak your dive stance

46
00:01:43,958 --> 00:01:46,625
to get the most
out of your entry.

47
00:01:46,708 --> 00:01:49,083
We're trying to shave our
exchange times down to zero.

48
00:01:49,166 --> 00:01:50,458
[AMAKATA] Isn't that
cutting if awfully close?

49
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,250
I mean, what happens
if you hit the water

50
00:01:52,333 --> 00:01:53,750
before the other's
reached the wall?

51
00:01:53,833 --> 00:01:55,208
[NAGISA]
Instant disqualification.

52
00:01:55,291 --> 00:01:57,041
It's just one of the
risks you learn to accept

53
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,500
for the sake of the team.

54
00:01:58,583 --> 00:02:00,916
Miss A, we know it's late,
but mastering this technique

55
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:04,208
is gonna give us an edge
against the competition.

56
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,708
[PRINCIPAL 9A]
Practice is running long, I see.

57
00:02:06,791 --> 00:02:08,333
[MAKOTO]
Oh. Hello, sir.

58
00:02:08,416 --> 00:02:10,333
[AMAKATA]
Oh no, it's the principal!

59
00:02:10,416 --> 00:02:11,791
I'm dreadfully sorry, sir!

60
00:02:11,875 --> 00:02:14,416
I just told these boys it's
well past time to wrap up!

61
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:16,625
[COUNSELOR 9A]
Ah, you're fine. No harm done.

62
00:02:16,708 --> 00:02:18,250
[PRINCIPAL 9A]
Stay as long as you need.

63
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,916
It's not often one our own
gets scouted by the pros.

64
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,166
Eh, Nanase?

65
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:23,583
We haven't been this excited

66
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,750
about Regionals
in quite some time.

67
00:02:25,833 --> 00:02:28,916
Every member of the faculty
is as thrilled as can be.

68
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Do your school proud.

69
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,833
[HARUKA]
Yes, sir.

70
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,500
[GOU]
Oh, by the way.

71
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:39,291
I thought you might get a kick
out of knowing that Nitori's

72
00:02:39,375 --> 00:02:42,041
on the short list for
Samezuka's Regionals team.

73
00:02:42,125 --> 00:02:44,041
[NAGISA]
I get to swim against Aye-Aye?

74
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,375
This'll be a piece of cake!

75
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,041
Though, I suppose
any way you slice it,

76
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,541
we'll have our work cut out
for us with So-So and Rin.

77
00:02:49,625 --> 00:02:51,625
[REI]
Who on earth is "So-so?"

78
00:02:51,708 --> 00:02:52,958
Oh. That's great news!

79
00:02:53,041 --> 00:02:55,166
Then Sosuke's shoulder
must be healed!

80
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,375
[NAGISA]
That's my nickname for Sosuke.

81
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:57,625
[GOU]
Hey, Makoto, something wrong?

82
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:59,125
Huh? I'm good.

83
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,708
I was just wondering
if you'd heard about

84
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:02,625
anything going on with Yamazaki?

85
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:03,875
[GOU]
Like what?

86
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,791
Uh-- Actually, forget it,
I don't even know.

87
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:12,291
[MAKOTO] You think what
Kisumi told us is for real?

88
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,500
I don't know, man.
Could be gossip.

89
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:17,458
I mean, the guy
is still swimming.

90
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:18,833
I guess you got a point.

91
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:20,208
Either way it doesn't
really matter,

92
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,041
what we need to worry about
right now is ourselves.

93
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,416
[NAGISA]
This place is huge!

94
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,000
Wow. Quite an upgrade from
where we stayed last year.

95
00:05:03,083 --> 00:05:05,333
[MAKOTO] Watch us get stuck
in a broom closet while Miss A

96
00:05:05,416 --> 00:05:06,458
and Gou get a tricked out

97
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,000
presidential suite
or something.

98
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,916
[REI] I do not need a flashback
to training camp right now.

99
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,541
Please, it's not the same thing.

100
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:13,708
That's right.

101
00:05:13,791 --> 00:05:14,750
You gentlemen are
the stars of this show,

102
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,208
so you get star treatment.

103
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,625
Before you go nuts,
remember the old proverb:

104
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:20,375
"Nothing in this world
is more expensive

105
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,333
than that which comes free,
for it is invaluable!"

106
00:05:23,416 --> 00:05:24,750
Or something like that.

107
00:05:24,833 --> 00:05:27,541
The main take-away is no
belly-aching about the rooms.

108
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:28,791
[BOYS]
Yes, ma'am.

Oh look, it's Rin!

112
00:05:32,958 --> 00:05:34,125
Well! What do ya know?

113
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,125
I guess we're all stayin'
at the same hotel.

114
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,208
[NAGISA] Waddup, Aye-Aye!
How's it goin'?

115
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:39,833
[NITORI] How many times
do I have to ask you

116
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:41,250
not to call me that?

117
00:05:41,333 --> 00:05:43,083
Oh, Sosuke, I've been meaning
to ask why you were all

118
00:05:43,166 --> 00:05:44,291
cloak-and-dagger
at the station

119
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,750
near our house the
other day? Kinda weird.

120
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,333
Uh. What?

121
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:49,833
Yo! I'm pouring
my heart out to you

122
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:52,791
and you pass me up to give
Sosuke the third degree?

123
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,916
The Otter needs some
tender love and care!

124
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,375
Fact: My fav ice cream bar
is chocolate pudding!

125
00:05:57,458 --> 00:06:00,500
Fact: When ordering a hamburger,
I always go for triple cheese!

126
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:03,958
Fact: The sorta gal guaranteed
to drive me crazy--

Is off limits!

128
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,375
[SOSUKE]
I should go.

129
00:06:06,458 --> 00:06:08,291
[GOU]
Uh. Yeah, sure.

130
00:06:08,375 --> 00:06:09,750
[RIN] Everybody get
settled into their rooms

131
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:11,583
and meet back here
in twenty. Understood?

132
00:06:11,666 --> 00:06:13,041
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

Okay, fellahs! It's chow time!

134
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:18,250
Miss Amakata gave us enough
cash to feed a small army,

135
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,916
so pick whatever looks good!

136
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,416
Does it have to be healthy?

[HARUKA]
This is my pick.

Cool!

you to Todou,

my university's top scout!

Seriously?

151
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:46,541
[MIKOSHIBA]
I figured I'd show him

152
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:49,708
what the Samezuka
team's capable of.

153
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,333
Is that by chance
Nanase from Iwatobi?

154
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:53,666
You bet!

155
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:55,208
Wait a second, this man's
actually heard of Haru?

In my line of work, who hasn't?

Hi there. Honor to
meet you, young man.

158
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,708
You've got quite the reputation.

159
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:04,708
After that District
tournament, your freestyle

160
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,375
has become something
of a minor legend.

161
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:09,208
You've been on my
radar for a while.

162

Mine and every college
with a swim team.

163
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:14,416
Not to sound preachy,
but are you even aware

164
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,916
how much potential
you have, son?

165
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,375
Can't let that
talent go to waste.

166

Stay focused and the sky's
the limit, I assure you.

[HARUKA]
Drop the act.

203
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,708
I saw Kisumi the other day.

So how long's he
been gone, exactly?

I dunno, he snuck off
while I was in the shower.

You know him, he's probably
out jogging or whatever.

[RIN]
Ugh. Great.

213
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:04,125
The entire place is crawling
with college scouts.

214
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:08,750
Of all nights to go MIA.
That guy is such a loose cannon.

215
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:11,250
So, d'you want to talk to
him about something, or...?

216
00:10:11,333 --> 00:10:13,625
[RIN] Yeah, I want to
ask him if he's decided

217
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:15,750
what he wants to do yet.

218
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:17,416
Guess he's just
running away, as usual.

219
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:21,166
Big shock there.
What is he thinking?

220
00:10:21,250 --> 00:10:22,833
[MAKOTO] I wouldn't
read too much into it.

221
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:25,333
With some people, it's just
how they clear their heads.

222
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:28,250
He's more of a doer,
than a talker.

polite way of puttin' it.

[MAKOTO]
Uh?

Look, there's no reason
a swimmer at your level

228
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:43,041
wouldn't be scouted by at
least a second tier school.

[RIN gasps]

468
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,416
No one asked you to
care about my future!

469
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:56,500
What "future?" What is it
you think I have?

470
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,333
This is my life, not yours!

471
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,625
I'm not you!

472
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,041
I'm never going to be you!

473
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,208
[MAKOTO]
Haru...

474
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,583
[REI]
You didn't mean any of that...?

475
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:17,583
How long have you guys
been standing there?

476
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:22,041
[HARUKA]
Listen. It's okay.

477
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:26,375
We're a team. And I'm
still gonna swim relay.

478
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:28,791
I didn't come this far not to.

479
00:21:35,166 --> 00:21:45,791
[SOSUKE panting, sobbing]

480
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:22,000
[SOSUKE] Why couldn't we
have stayed kids forever?

481
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:23,750
It's so much harder
holding on to your dreams

482
00:23:23,833 --> 00:23:26,416
once the world gets
its hooks into you.

483
00:23:26,500 --> 00:23:28,000
[RIN]
What are you talking about?

484
00:23:28,083 --> 00:23:30,666
If you're dreaming,
you must be asleep.

485
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:31,791
Wake up, man!

486
00:23:31,875 --> 00:23:34,500
It's time to make
those dreams real.

487
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:37,000
Next time:
"Six-Beat of Tears!"

488
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,541
[SOSUKE]
Hey, Rin.

489
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,416
Be honest with me: you still
want the same things out of life

490
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,583
you did when we were little?
