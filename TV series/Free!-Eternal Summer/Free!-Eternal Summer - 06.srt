1
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,833
Listen up, party people,
we're down to the wire.

2
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,041
District!

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:20,625
That means you need
plenty of beauty sleep.

4
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:21,708
You got it?

5
00:00:21,791 --> 00:00:23,041
We'll meet up
in front of registration

6
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,500
at 8am sharp.
Come late and I end you.

7
00:00:25,583 --> 00:00:27,125
Are we ready?

8
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,208
Oh-ho yeah!

9
00:00:28,291 --> 00:00:29,750
We've got this one in the bag!

10
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,416
Even picked ourselves up some
awesome matching swimsuits!

11
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,958
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Yes we did.

12
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:37,708
What do you say we go over the
program one more time, guys?

13
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:40,083
First day of District will
be the individual races.

14
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:41,291
Second's relay.

15
00:00:41,375 --> 00:00:43,083
For the indies,
looks like we have Nagisa

16
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,791
on the hundred-meter
breaststroke.

17
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:45,875
Yep!

18
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,666
[MAKOTO]
Rei on hundred-meter butterfly.

19
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,208
Of course.

20
00:00:49,291 --> 00:00:51,416
[MAKOTO] Haru on the hundred
and two-hundred-meter freestyle.

21
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,125
And as for me, I've got
the hundred-meter backstroke,

22
00:00:54,208 --> 00:00:56,333
plus the two-hundred-meter
freestyle.

23
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:57,916
[AMAKATA]
Am I missing something?

24
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,541
If you're doing freestyle with
Haru, why not the hundred-meter?

25
00:01:00,625 --> 00:01:01,708
'Cause he'll kick my butt--

26
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,541
I need the laps
just to stay on him.

27
00:01:03,625 --> 00:01:04,416
Yeah, right.

28
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:05,958
Someone's being overly modest.

29
00:01:06,041 --> 00:01:08,291
C'mon man, you've been muscling
up your freestyle for weeks.

30
00:01:08,375 --> 00:01:10,583
Our friend here will have his
work cut out for him either way.

31
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:11,875
It'll take more
training than that

32
00:01:11,958 --> 00:01:13,291
to compete with Haru.

33
00:01:13,375 --> 00:01:15,458
I think the two-hundred meter
will be more my speed.

34
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:39,916
[MAKOTO]
Haru.

35
00:01:42,791 --> 00:01:44,958
I'm gonna need a favor.

36
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,583
[YOUNG MAKOTO]
What do you think?

37
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:25,625
Cool, huh?

38
00:03:25,708 --> 00:03:27,291
Being in the Swim Club
will be fun!

39
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,041
[YOUNG HARUKA]
I told you I don't want to.

40
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:30,166
[YOUNG MAKOTO]
Aw, c'mon, man,

41
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,541
I thought you were
all about swimming!

42
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,625
[YOUNG HARUKA]
Yeah, not so much.

43
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:35,875
What do you need me for?

44
00:03:35,958 --> 00:03:38,375
There's nothing stopping
you from joining, right?

45
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:40,375
[YOUNG MAKOTO] I'm not
gonna do it if you don't.

46
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,250
[YOUNG HARUKA gasps]
How come?

47
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,791
[YOUNG MAKOTO]
'Cause! We're a team!

48
00:03:43,875 --> 00:03:46,125
If we can't do it together,
what's the point?

49
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:48,541
[YOUNG HARUKA gasps]

50
00:03:48,625 --> 00:03:51,625
[COACH 6A] We've got two new
members with us today, everyone.

51
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:55,000
Haruka Nanase and
Makoto Tachibana.

52
00:03:55,083 --> 00:03:57,166
[YOUNG MAKOTO] Uh, thanks
a lot. Good to be here.

53
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,500
[BOYS]
Welcome to the club!

54
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,750
[BOYS]
Whoa!

55
00:04:04,833 --> 00:04:06,583
He's awesome!

56
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,875
[YOUNG MAKOTO]
Great job.

57
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:15,375
Everybody says you're the
best one in the water.

58
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:18,791
See, I told ya!

59
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,083
Whatever.

60
00:04:21,708 --> 00:04:23,125
[SASABE]
Huh? Oh, hey!

61
00:04:23,208 --> 00:04:24,333
'Sup, newbies?

62
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:26,500
You young 'uns have
a good time, or what?

63
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:28,500
[YOUNG MAKOTO]
Yeah!

64
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,333
It's hard to tell,
but he thinks so too.

65
00:04:31,416 --> 00:04:32,958
[SASABE] I imagine the two
of you are pretty much

66
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:35,416
joined at the hip.
Ah! That's right.

67
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,041
Pick a couple. On the house.

68
00:04:37,125 --> 00:04:40,375
Our way of sayin'
we're glad you came.

69
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,791
[BOTH gasp]

70
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:44,041
[SASABE]
Yeah, dolphins are all the rage.

71
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:46,041
I've only got the one left.
Sorry about that.

72
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:49,500
Nothing a friendly game of rock,
paper, scissors can't decide--

73
00:04:49,583 --> 00:04:50,416
[YOUNG MAKOTO]
It's okay.

74
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,083
This guy is more me anyway.

75
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:53,583
That's not the one you want.

76
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:56,125
Meh. We're good.
I'm happy with either of 'em.

77
00:04:56,208 --> 00:04:58,000
Here, dophin's yours.

78
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:14,875
[GOU yelps]

79
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,083
Whoa there, sis.
Watch your step.

80
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,833
Sorry. I'm a klutz.

81
00:05:30,916 --> 00:05:32,708
[RIN]
Hey, old man.

82
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:35,333
Keep an eye on me
this year, huh?

83
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:37,125
Appreciate it.

84
00:05:37,208 --> 00:05:39,333
[GOU] You good on time,
or do we need to head back?

85
00:05:39,416 --> 00:05:40,958
You've gotta round up your
team for the big tournament,

86
00:05:41,041 --> 00:05:43,541
don't you? This is your first
District Meet as captain,

87
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,666
so you'll have to be
in charge of everybody.

88
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:47,375
Yeah, that's not a problem.

89
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,666
[GOU giggles]
'Kay, Dad: we're out.

90
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,125
See you next time.

91
00:05:51,208 --> 00:05:53,500
Oh, wait, hold up a sec.

92
00:05:53,583 --> 00:05:55,375
[RIN]
This is for you.

93
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:57,625
Wow. How long have you
been holding on to this?

94
00:05:57,708 --> 00:05:59,125
[RIN]
Long enough, I think.

95
00:05:59,208 --> 00:06:02,666
It's yours now. Keep it safe.

96
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:05,625
Might make Pops happy
to see it back up at Iwatobi.

97
00:06:05,708 --> 00:06:08,083
Old man always was
the sentimental type.

98
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,166
Now let's get out there
and bust our keisters!

99
00:06:13,250 --> 00:06:14,833
[RIN]
What exactly are you gonna do?

100
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,958
Ugh, I swear.

101
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,291
[GOU]
Hey, wait!

102
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:19,666
What is that supposed to mean?

103
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,291
I do stuff!

104
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:29,583
[NAGISA] So is anyone else
flashing back to last summer?

105
00:06:29,666 --> 00:06:31,625
This's gonna be awesome!

106
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,250
[REI] Last year, I was so
nervous I could barely function.

107
00:06:34,333 --> 00:06:35,958
But this time it's
a different story!

108
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:38,041
This time, I'm in the
best shape of my life!

109
00:06:38,125 --> 00:06:39,958
[NAGISA giggles]
Sounds like somebody finally

110
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,333
got some hair on their chest.

111
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:42,916
You're disgusting!

112
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,916
I assure you, if I had hair
on my chest I would shave it!

113
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,541
[GOU]
Hey, guys! We're over here!

114
00:06:47,625 --> 00:06:49,291
[BOYS]
Good morning, everyone!

115
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,166
Hi, boys. Good to see you.

116
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:52,250
[SASABE]
Hope you're ready.

117
00:06:52,333 --> 00:06:53,958
I'll be cheerin' for ya'.

118
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:56,833
[MALE SWIMMERS]
Good morning, sir!

119
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:58,625
[NAGISA]
There's the Samezuka team.

120
00:06:58,708 --> 00:06:59,500
[REI]
Wait, is--?

121
00:06:59,583 --> 00:07:01,500
Is that Mikoshiba?

122
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,541
[MIKOSHIBA]
Long time no see!

123
00:07:03,625 --> 00:07:05,291
How you gettin'
along without me?

124
00:07:05,375 --> 00:07:06,666
[MALE SWIMMERS]
Excellent, sir!

125
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,291
Don'tcha got nothin'
better to do

126
00:07:08,375 --> 00:07:09,750
than relive your glory days?

127
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:11,250
What?

128
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,125
Speak up, kid, I can't hear ya!
Give the attitude a boost!

129
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,916
Your big brother didn't
kick butt and take names

130
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,041
by mumbling his way
through a pep talk!

131
00:07:17,125 --> 00:07:20,166
Ow! Cut it out! Ow! Stop!

132
00:07:23,708 --> 00:07:25,125
[BOTH]
Gou!

133
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,666
[RIN groans]

134
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,208
Uh...

135
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:31,458
So now would be a good time
to go inside, don't you think?

136
00:07:31,541 --> 00:07:33,583
[MAKOTO]
Sure. Let's do this.

137
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:43,291
[NAGISA] Wow! Is it me,
or does it seem like

138
00:07:43,375 --> 00:07:46,541
there're more schools
here than last year?

139
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,333
[GOU] I'm swimming in an
ocean of well-toned bodies.

140
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:52,541
Pure, lean muscle.
How did I go so long?

141
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,000
No, no. Pull yourself together.

142
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:58,041
You can do this.
Be strong. Be strong...

143
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,291
Good heavens, Gou.
You're trembling like a leaf.

144
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:01,875
Please don't hurl on our bags.

145
00:08:01,958 --> 00:08:03,208
[NAGISA]
Huh?

146
00:08:03,291 --> 00:08:04,666
How can you be sick?
You're in your element here!

147
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,916
You're surrounded by
rock hard muscles!

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,416
[GOU] I made a promise
not to get too excited.

149
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,583
[MAKOTO]
What're you talkin' about?

150
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:11,583
[GOU]
Look.

151
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:12,958
I know it sounds stupid,
all right?

152
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:15,041
But the thing is, I thought
if I could play it cool,

153
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:16,875
we could use the karma.

154
00:08:16,958 --> 00:08:19,250
You know maybe build it
up for Nationals?

155
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:21,583
No more muscles 'til
we go all the way!

156
00:08:21,666 --> 00:08:22,791
[REI, NAGISA, MAKOTO]
Uh...

157
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,875
[REI] Sorry, I don't

00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:39,791
He keeps talking like that,

312
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,083
he's gonna jinx
himself big time.

you cleared District.

Because he's amazing!

[REI] Thank you.
That means a lot to me.

I just-- I worked so hard to
get to this point, you know?

Yeah you did!

And in first place

knowing you're on
your way to Regionals!

330
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:29,291
All we need now is for
Haru to place in freestyle.

Ha! You gotta be kidding me!

He could win
freestyle blindfolded!

333

Makoto, you're swimming
the freestyle too, right?

334
00:15:34,958 --> 00:15:35,958
Two hundred?

335
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:36,583
Wouldn't miss it.

He's taken the lead!

I want you to swim against me

with everything you've got.
No holding back.

I need this to be legit.

Dude, why?

361
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:16,916
Is this the whole reason you're
doing freestyle tomorrow?

This is our last year, man.

it's over.

So before we graduate, I just...

I want one all-out
race against you.

What do you get out of this;
why do you swim?

Because it's fun.

we do together as a team.
