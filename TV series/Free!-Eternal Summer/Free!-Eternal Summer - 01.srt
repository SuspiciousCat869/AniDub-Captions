You dive in,

It's hungry. Territorial.

Unless, of course, we're

You too, Makoto.

This where you sleep?
Good morning, Haruka--

I thought we agreed
not to call me that.

Fine.

I told the guys we'd meet
'em at the station-- Uh.

It's a little cold out
there for an apron!

[HARUKA] I need to
make my lunch, man.

yourselves like this

165
00:07:28,041 --> 00:07:29,750
I didn't see
that one coming.

166
00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:30,916
Rin's far from
the obvious choice

167
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,250
for Mikoshiba's replacement.

168
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,125
Are you crazy?
His body's in top shape!

169
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,166
If that's not a captain's
physique, I don't know what is!

back here with us.

178
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:54,125
Ugh. I'm telling ya,
we should've just made

179
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,625
an action movie,
apparently anyone can.

180
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:57,958
Right now really
isn't the ideal time

181
00:07:58,041 --> 00:07:59,333
for expressing second thoughts.

Don't be that way.

we have the Swim Club.

I'm not saying we're the
coolest club in school.

I'm not even saying
we're the best.

We're just the people
who got it in our heads

192

last spring to fix your pool!
I'm Gou Matsuoka, club manager.

asked his best feature

I told you we'd just
look cheap up there!

Couldn't we've been
tasteful and understated?

The show was fine,

219
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:36,083
it's just a bad time of
year for new recruits.

220
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,750
If they could see us swim,
they'd be here in droves.

[NAGISA] So you're tellin' me
there's nothing we can do

to drum up a little interest?

We're not going there.

225
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:47,458
We could have someone draw
us as comic book heroes?

226
00:09:47,541 --> 00:09:49,208
We tried that
last year, remember?

227
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,916
We could always parade around in
our swimsuits twenty-four-seven.

[RIN] To make it on
the Samezuka Swim Team,

234
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:03,458
you need to beat the benchmark
time, no exceptions.

235
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:04,708
Pay attention to form.

Pick a style you feel
comfortable with

237

and show us what you've got.

00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,833
I can't be captain!

It's my call.

about making this team
great? Man up, Rin.

You all right, sir?

250
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,208
You look a bit preoccupied.

gotta stop calling me sir.

[NITORI]
Yes, si-- uh, okay.

There's a ton of people here.

00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,250
I didn't know we'd
stirred up so much hype.

257
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:45,750
[RIN] Maybe they
wanna catch a glimpse

258
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:48,333
of the "world-class athlete"
Mikoshiba was talking about.

259
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,166
Do you think there's a chance
he's here right now?

260
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,458
I dunno, but keep
standing here

261
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,375
you might lose your
place to a First Year.

262
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,625
Oh! Right!

263
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:55,833
[AMAKATA]
Open the pool?

264
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:57,833
Yeah, so we can start
practice earlier!

265
00:10:57,916 --> 00:11:00,458
And maybe in the process get
a few new members interested.

266
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:01,750
I get where you're
coming from,

267
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,041
but even if I could open it,
isn't it too cold?

268
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:05,875
The cold doesn't
bother me at all.

269
00:11:05,958 --> 00:11:07,958
No reason swimming
can't be a winter sport.

270
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:09,750
[GROUP]
We're begging you, miss!

What about Coach
Sasabe's indoor pool?

274
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,291
I think it's opening soon.

00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:21,791

Hm. I guess.

Huh? Oh, hey there!
You lookin' to join up?

277
00:11:24,458 --> 00:11:26,125

for another month,

but we're accepting
membership applications.

[SOSUKE]
No, thanks.

280
00:11:32,041 --> 00:11:36,875
[SASABE] So, you scoping
the competition, or what?

281
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:38,541
The Iwatobi guys aren't here?

282
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,125
Someone told me this
is where they meet.

283
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:43,041
Huh? Ah, well.
That someone told you right.

284
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:46,208
See, developers were supposed
to turn this place into a spa.

285
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,541
But they went bankrupt
when the bubble burst.

286
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:51,000
Whole kit 'n' caboodle
was slated for demolition.

287
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:52,916
Golden opportunity
for me though.

288
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,083
I used the revenue from
my grandpa's squid boat

289
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:57,750
to buy this li'l piece o'
heaven and remodel it.

290
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,541
Labor of love, let me tell ya.

291
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:00,750
Before I met these kids,

292
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,291
no one would've taken me
for the kind of guy

293
00:12:02,375 --> 00:12:03,791
to see a project
like this through,

294
00:12:03,875 --> 00:12:05,208
but that's the moral, I guess:

295
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,250
live free, live bold,
devil take the hindmo--!

296
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:09,875
Oh. All righty, then.

297
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,083
[MAKOTO] Don't get me wrong,
Coach's place is nice.

298
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,541
I just think it's
good PR to clean out

299
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:15,458
our own pool first, y'know?

300
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,500
[REI] I agree. Even if
we can't fill it in yet,

301
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,333
at least we can still
make a good impression.

302
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,666
[GOU] Don't worry, Miss A
will come through for us.

303
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,375
We'll be up and
runnin' in no time.

304
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:25,041
[NAGISA] Betcha we're gonna
have so many new bloods

305
00:12:25,125 --> 00:12:27,125
wantin' to join, this
place'll be crazy, yeah?

306
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,875
Hey, as long as they're
serious about swimming.

307
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,958
[NAGISA] You've gotta
learn to lighten up, man.

308
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:33,541
Watch the attitude. Please?

309
00:12:33,625 --> 00:12:34,750
We don't want to
chase recruits off

310
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,083
before they've had
a chance to get wet,

311
00:12:36,166 --> 00:12:38,375
the club's survival
hinges on numbers.

312
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:41,083
Relays aren't going to happen
with just the four of us.

313
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:43,291
Not everyone can
be as grim as you.

314
00:12:43,375 --> 00:12:45,333
[SASABE]
Fresh-faced recruits, huh?

315
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,166
Well, the surefire way
to scare up interest

316
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,750
is to win some races.

317
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,000
[REI] Obviously, yes,
but easier said than done.

318
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,375
[MAKOTO] I'm sorry, Coach.
You needed us for something?

319
00:12:53,458 --> 00:12:54,750
[SASABE laughs]

320
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:57,000
[SASABE] Nothing worthwhile
is ever easy, my friend.

321
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:59,250
But you do have
a hell of a resource!

322
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:01,125
[gasps]

323
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,458
[MAKOTO] The Iwatobi Swim Club
is back in business!

324
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,541
[SASABE] Yes it is!
I give you: Iwatobi SC Returns!

325
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,166
Say hello to months of
blood, sweat, tears, escrow,

326
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,833
and the perfect pH balance!

327
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:13,958
[NAGISA] You're the greatest
human being alive!

328
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,375
Yeah, thank you Coach!

329
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:16,916
Look, if you wanna thank me,

330
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,208
train hard and kick some tail at
next week's city tournament

331
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,291
like the champions
I know you to be!

332
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,791
Aw... Not so fast, chief!

333
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,125
[MAKOTO]
Haru, wait! He said--!

334
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,416
[splash]

335
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,083
Damn it! Listen when
people are talking to you!

336
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,708
Last one in's
a rotten egg!

337
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:30,916
[SASABE]
Fine! Use the locker room!

338
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:40,083
[RIN] Okay, well, since
it's a city tournament,

339
00:13:40,166 --> 00:13:41,500
I guess we won't
make it mandatory

340
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:42,666
for everyone on the team to--

341
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,125
[NAGISA]
Rin!

342

[NAGISA laughs]

343
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:47,583
Ugh. As I was saying,

344
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:48,958
you don't have to go
if you don't want,

345
00:13:49,041 --> 00:13:51,083
but it'd put some experience
under your belt.

346
00:13:51,166 --> 00:13:52,041
Give it some thought.

347
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:53,666
[CLUB MEMBERS]
Right!

348
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,833
[REI]
What do you know?

349
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,666
The man makes a decent
captain after all.

350
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,625
"Rawr! Do or die, maggots!
Take no prisoners!"

351
00:13:59,708 --> 00:14:01,875
That's my impression of what
he thinks he sounds like.

352
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,625
Now, that's not very nice.

353
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:04,958
[SASABE]
You're late!

354
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,208
[NAGISA] Whoa! Why're
you suited up, Coach?

355
00:14:07,291 --> 00:14:10,541
Ha! 'Cause! There's a
gen pop category, too!

356
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,083
[AMAKATA] It's a much
more relaxed atmosphere

357
00:14:12,166 --> 00:14:15,125
than the regionals.
Rather nice, if you ask me.

358
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:18,000
If you go for paunches and
underdeveloped muscles maybe.

359
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:20,500
Shame there's no relay for us
to showcase our teamwork.

360
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,583
Yeah, kinda sucks.

361
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,375
But there'll be relays
in the regionals, though.

362
00:14:31,458 --> 00:14:32,583
[HARUKA]
Hey, man.

363
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:34,375
You hanging out for
the hell of it, or what?

364
00:14:34,458 --> 00:14:37,541
Waitin' on you, man.

365
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,708
[RIN] We're in lanes
next to each other again.

366
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:41,166
[HARUKA]
I saw.

367
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:42,708
[RIN] Listen, since you guys
can't train in the winter,

368
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:44,958
it's only fair if
I give you a handicap.

369
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:49,000
Just say the word. I want
this race to be interesting.

370
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:51,000
[HARUKA]
We don't need your charity.

371
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:54,458
There are ways to
train without a pool.

372
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:55,791
[RIN chuckles]

373
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,458
[RIN] Sounds like an intense
off-season regimen.

374
00:14:58,541 --> 00:15:00,458
You'll have to show it to me.
If you can catch up--

375
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:01,583
[BOY 1B]
You ready to go down?

In your dreams, loser!

[RIN and HARUKA chuckle]

380
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,791
[RIN]
No relay in this one, buddy.

381
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:13,125
Just us. Mano y mano.

382
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:15,708
It's not like I'm worried
about setting a record.

383
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:19,375
Still tryin' to play it off
like you don't really care?

384
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:23,583
Heh. Whatever.
Keep telling yourself that.

385
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:24,791
You may not care
about winning,

386
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,625
but you still think
you're the best.

387
00:15:27,708 --> 00:15:30,083
You're too cool for
your own good, dude.

388
00:15:30,166 --> 00:15:32,500
I'm gonna light
a fire under you.

389
00:15:33,458 --> 00:15:36,166

Nice. Rin and Haru are up next.

Rin a run for his money!

it in you, man.

Whatever you say.

[GOU] Way to go, Haru!
You were amazing!

You didn't just outdo yourself,
you tied with my brother!

[AMAKATA] I think you all
reached a new personal best.

[SASABE] Meh, I'd have done
better if I'd kept in shape.

[RIN gasps]

444
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,125
Remember that time
in elementary school

445
00:18:43,208 --> 00:18:44,750
when you told me your dream?

446
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:47,125
You wanted to swim in
a pool of cherry blossoms.

447
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,416
Our original plan was to
spruce up the pool a little

448
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,750
as an advertisement
aimed at new members.

Miss A got us permission
to open it early.

But no one came, so the
work was all for naught.

451
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,083

468
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:33,875
[NAGISA] It's not gonna
let up any time soon.

469
00:19:33,958 --> 00:19:37,041
All that breathtaking beauty
spoiled by a little rainfall.

470
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:38,791
Is your glass
always half empty?

471
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:40,083
I mean, I'm just sayin'.

472
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:41,666
[REI]
I'm being a realist!

473
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,875
[MAKOTO] I didn't even know that
rain was in the forecast today.

474
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,666
[RIN]
Hey, uh.

475
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,583
You guys... you ever
give any thought

476
00:19:53,666 --> 00:19:57,208
to life after graduation?

477
00:19:57,291 --> 00:19:58,416
Not really.

478
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,500
So you have no idea
what you're gonna do?

479
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:04,583
Heh, heh. We can't all have
our sights set as high as you.

480
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,125
[RIN]
You're kidding, right?

481
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,791
I've wasted so much time,
it's not even funny.

482
00:20:08,875 --> 00:20:12,375
The Nationals this summer are
my last shot at being scouted.

483
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,000
They'll be coming from all over.

484
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:19,416
I need to batten down,
focus on bringing my A-game.

485
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:24,291
[RIN]
But seriously, though.

486
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:28,208
What're you gonna do once
high school's just a memory?

487
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:30,916
Wish I could say.

488
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,208
Truth is, I haven't decided.

489
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:39,166
Tch.

490
00:20:41,208 --> 00:20:43,708
[RIN]
How can you not have a plan?

491
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:47,375
[birds chirp]

492
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:51,083
Aw, poor tree
looks all naked.

493
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:54,625
[REI] And to add insult to
injury, the pool's a mess.

494
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,458
[MAKOTO]
Might as well get to cleaning.

495
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:04,458
Yeah, alright.

496
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,208
[bell rings]

497
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,625
Might have been staged,
but I dunno,

498
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,250
it looked pretty real to me.

499
00:21:16,333 --> 00:21:18,541
[STUDENT 1B]
Hey, thanks man. I owe you one.

500
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,083
Yeah, sure.

501
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,750
[TEACHER 1A]
Take your seats, please.

502
00:21:21,833 --> 00:21:23,458
I'd like to introduce
your new classmate.

503
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:25,833
Just transferred this morning.

504
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:30,083
Everyone, please join me in
welcoming one Sosuke Yamazaki.

505
00:21:30,166 --> 00:21:32,583
He comes to us all
the way from Tokyo.

506
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:40,208
[applause]

507
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,666
Holy crap.

508
00:21:43,708 --> 00:21:45,958
[SOSUKE chuckles]

509
00:23:18,708 --> 00:23:20,250
[HARUKA]
Iwamoge, god of the ocean,

510
00:23:20,333 --> 00:23:22,000
transforms Rin into a cyborg

511
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:24,958
and commands him to save Gou
from a ruthless band of pirates.

512
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:26,750
[REI] Um, we vetoed
the comic book idea?

513
00:23:26,833 --> 00:23:28,833
[NAGISA] What's with the
new guy over at Samezuka?

514
00:23:28,916 --> 00:23:30,208
Anybody know his story?

515
00:23:30,291 --> 00:23:32,625
[HARUKA] Next time:
Stroke of Chance Encounter.

516
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,375
Where our rival team's
newest addition

517
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,916
will be revealed
by divine vision!

518
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,625
[REI] Let it go! We're done
with the sea god shtick!

519
00:23:39,708 --> 00:23:41,666
[NAGISA] I thought
it was kinda cool.
