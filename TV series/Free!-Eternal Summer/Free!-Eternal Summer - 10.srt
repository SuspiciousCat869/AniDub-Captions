If you don't hurry,
you'll miss Rin's race!

Don't worry about it. I'm fine.

I told him his father

If you don't wanna

Tell me why.

Why did you lie to me?
I think I have a right to know.

144
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,125
You and me are like rivals.

145
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,166
We shouldn't be
on the same team.

146
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:39,416
At least that's how
I used to see it.

147
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:43,250
When you told me you were
transferring to Iwatobi,

148
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,375
I didn't say a word.

149
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,125
Why would I?

150
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,208
And when I started
middle school,

151
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:52,083
all I did was focus on swimming.

152
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:55,041
You were off chasing
your dreams in Australia.

153
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:58,708
So I figured I would
work toward my own dream.

154
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:01,791
After a while, your
letters stopped coming.

155
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:04,083
I kept rooting for you, though.

156
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:08,625
I knew you'd break through
that wall one way or another.

157
00:09:08,708 --> 00:09:10,083
Once I got into high school,

158
00:09:10,166 --> 00:09:13,083
I got even more obsessed
with my training.

159
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:17,041
My dream was gonna happen,
no matter what the cost.

160
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:21,000
I used to imagine what
it'd be like when I'd

161
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:24,125
finally made it to a
big International meet.

162
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:27,750
Every time I pictured it,
you were right there beside me.

163
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:32,833
Those were crazy times.

164
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:36,791
I trained hard,
all day, every day.

165
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,250
No one could touch me.

166
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:41,208
I was the best.

167
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,916
And that's when it happened.

168
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,333
My shoulder starting
giving me issues.

169
00:09:49,416 --> 00:09:52,208
Nothing I couldn't
handle, at first.

170
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:55,166
So I ignored it
and kept on going.

171
00:09:55,250 --> 00:09:57,500
Eventually, it got worse.

172
00:09:57,583 --> 00:10:00,416
Every day it hurt
a little more.

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:05,041
But no matter how bad it got,
I refused to give up.

174
00:10:05,125 --> 00:10:09,500
I had to get stronger. It's
like my dream was out there,

175
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:13,625
calling from a distance,
mocking me.

176
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:17,750
I stayed at it,
but before long,

177
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:21,583
my shoulder finally gave out.

178
00:10:21,666 --> 00:10:26,000
It was the summer
of my freshman year.

179
00:10:26,083 --> 00:10:28,958
You wanna know why I lied?

180
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:31,000
'Cause when Gou told
me you were back.

181
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:33,416
I didn't want you
to see me that way.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,208
I didn't want you
to know the truth.

183
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,291
I just couldn't handle it,
for you of all people

184
00:10:37,375 --> 00:10:40,166
to see me all broken down.

185
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:43,000
Rehab. Injury. Rehab.

186
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:47,541
That was my routine.
Day in, day out.

187
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:50,791
A busted rotator cuff makes
it hard to come in first.

188
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:54,041
I got sick of being a loser.

189
00:10:54,125 --> 00:10:57,250
Truth is, I was miserable.

190
00:10:57,333 --> 00:11:01,083
And then one day,
I accepted reality.

191
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:05,541
No matter what I did,
my dream wasn't gonna happen.

192
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:11,625
So I turned my back
on swimming for good.

You quit swimming?

196
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,375
But I wanted to see you
compete one last time

197
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,208
before I decided to retire.

198
00:11:24,291 --> 00:11:27,083
So I dropped in on
last year's Regionals.

199
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,583
Wait, you actually
saw that race?

200
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:30,916
Yeah.

201
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,166
I wanted to watch the best
swimmer I've ever known

202
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,708
accomplish a goal
we used to share.

203
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:40,750
Thing is, when I saw you
struggling the way you were,

204
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:44,750
what can I say?
It broke my heart.

205
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,833
I thought you were the type
of guy who could overcome

206

any obstacle,
burst through any wall.

207
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:53,791
But something was wrong.
Something must've happened.

208
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,666
[RIN]
I give up. I quit years ago

209
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,625
and I should've stayed quit!

210
00:12:01,375 --> 00:12:05,208
[SOSUKE]
I wanted to call out to you...

211
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,875
But the words wouldn't come.

212
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:16,083
And then, in the relay
you swam with Haruka,

213
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,500
you went at it
with such intensity,

214
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:22,291
it's like you were
a changed man.

215
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:24,750
Seeing you with
the guys afterwards,

216
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,375
the way you were laughing
and carryin' on...

217
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,166
I dunno.

218
00:12:29,250 --> 00:12:32,875
It gave me a little twinge
of hope, I suppose.

219
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:36,125
The old dream came back to life.

You and me were gonna
swim side by side.

Honestly,

I didn't know what
it meant to you.

223
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:51,958
How important it was
to swim as part of a team.

224
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:54,208
I realize It's over for me.

225
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:57,833
But, before I go...

226
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,666
I wanna swim the

Oh, yes I can.

[whistle blowing]

00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:11,375

Ready. Set.

[CROWD]
Go!

321
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:18,541
Momo's so fast!
Right off the platform!

322
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:20,375
He's already got
a lead on Iwatobi!

323
00:17:20,458 --> 00:17:22,083
[GOU]
Wait!

324
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:24,791
Makoto's speed is in
his stroke not his start!

325
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:27,875
The longer he stays at it,
the faster he goes!

326
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,208
[AMAKATA] Look, he's
catching up with Samezuka!

327
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,833
[RIN, SOUSUKE]

It's close!

00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:38,833
They tied!

[MAKOTO]
Nagisa!

332
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:42,041
His relay exchange was perfect!

333
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,458
Guess their practice paid off!

334
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:45,500
[HANAMURA]
Wow!

335
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:46,958
Look how quickly
they took the lead!

[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!

339
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,416
Oh no...

340
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,458
His shoulder looks hurt.

341
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:04,375
[AMAKATA]
They're still tied!

342

[NAGISA]
Swim, Rei!

Go!

[MIKOSHIBA]
What's this all about?

346
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,791
I don't know what the heck
you guys think you're doing

347
00:18:11,875 --> 00:18:13,833
right now, but I know
what you should be doing,

348
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,958
and that's cheering
your teammates on!

349
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:17,666

[GOU] Oh no, Sosuke's
catching up to Rei!

352
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,083
[AMAKATA]
He's widening his lead!

353

All right!

360
00:19:10,333 --> 00:19:11,708
Last spurt!

Rin!

362
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:35,500
[MAKOTO] It looks like
they're both speeding up!

363
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:37,083
Those guys are amazing!

364
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:40,291
They entered the turn
at the exact same time!

can you believe it?

[HARUKA]
Yeah.

This is so amazing,
we made Nationals!

378
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:37,416
I can't even begin
to process this!

379
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:40,791
Good job, guys.
I'm proud of all of us.

Yeah. It sure did!

Huh?

Look at Sosuke bein'
a big cheese ball.

Well...

[SOSUKE laughs]

[HARUKA] The sky never changes.
Neither does the ocean.

396
00:23:23,458 --> 00:23:26,500
Sometimes it feels
like nothing changes.

[MAKOTO]
What are you talking about?

They're always changing.
That's their nature.
