You should at least try
to win, don't you think?

Isn't that the whole

about winning less
we'd win more too?

I have to admit, I'm curious why

Haruka's freestyle race
turned out the way it did.

42

What with all the talk of him
being scouted before the race.

Uh... There's an old saying.

"Even the best make mistakes."
Or something.

he is as a person.

he was at freestyle

inspired me to want
to be great, too.

like Haruka, I'd have it made!"

00:07:30,916 --> 00:07:32,083
I don't understand!
Are you saying

159
00:07:32,166 --> 00:07:33,583
you don't want to swim with him?

160
00:07:33,666 --> 00:07:34,958
Of course I want
to swim with Haru--

161
00:07:35,041 --> 00:07:36,916
it's the only thing I want!

162
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,541
Trouble is,
I just want Haruka

163
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:43,541
to be the Haruka who's free.
The Haru who swims because

164
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:47,333
he loves it more than
anything in the world.

165
00:07:47,416 --> 00:07:50,666
[NAGISA] Yeah, I know
exactly what you mean.

166
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,291
Hey. Good practice, man.

167
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:03,791
Thank you.

168
00:08:03,875 --> 00:08:05,166
Oh, that's right.

169
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,083
I almost forgot, you got
something in the mail today.

170
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,083
[RIN gasps]

171
00:08:13,166 --> 00:08:15,208
[SOSUKE]
Is it good news?

172
00:08:15,291 --> 00:08:16,625
[RIN]
Hey, Sosuke.

173
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:17,958
[SOSUKE]
Yeah?

174
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:20,541
You know what you're
gonna do after you graduate?

175
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:21,791
I dunno.

176
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:23,750
Maybe move back in with
my parents for a while,

177
00:08:23,833 --> 00:08:26,083
help my dad run his business.

178
00:08:26,166 --> 00:08:28,416
So, you're really
gonna quit swimming.

179
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,375
It's all over.

180
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:31,333
[SOSUKE]
Yep.

181
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,333
[RIN sighs]

182
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:35,250
[SOSUKE]
Hey, stop with the moping.

183
00:08:35,333 --> 00:08:38,250
I told ya, my dream's
already come true.

184
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:44,083
[BASEBALL CLUB MEMBERS]
Iwatobi! Go! Go! Go!

185
00:08:44,166 --> 00:08:46,458
[HANAMURA] It's always sad
after tournament season ends.

186
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,916
I guess it's 'cause all the
seniors are about to move on.

187
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
So many people saying
so many goodbyes,

188
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,208
it's totally depressing.

189
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,375
Is the Swim Club going
through that too?

190
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:56,541
Yeah, and you?

191
00:08:56,625 --> 00:08:57,875
The Calligraphy Club
meeting room

192
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,916
is like a graveyard right now.

193
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,458
Aw! I just can't believe

194
00:09:01,541 --> 00:09:03,375
I'm going to be a
third year so soon!

195
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:07,416
Next thing I know,
I'll be in the nursing home.

196
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,041
[GOU]
Look, it's Makoto.

197
00:09:09,125 --> 00:09:10,041
[HANAMURA]
That's weird.

198
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,291
He's never by himself like that.

199
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:16,916
[GOU]
The career counseling office?

200
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:23,416
[SOSUKE]
Hey. Haruka.

201
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,166
Uh...

202
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Can I talk to you for a second?

203
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,083
[HARUKA]
What do you want?

204
00:09:33,166 --> 00:09:34,625
Tell me.

205
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,916
Why did you stand up in the
middle of the freestyle race?

206
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,458
Whatever I did has
nothing to do with you.

207
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,708
Yeah, but I'm pretty sure
it has something to do with Rin.

208
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:43,750
Which means it's
my business now.

209
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:46,208
If you don't keep going,
then Rin might follow suit.

210
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,416
You know, it's not
the first time

211
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,625
you've said something
like that to me.

212
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,125
[SOSUKE]
Even if you don't realize it,

213
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:55,083
you're important to Rin.
Which is exactly why I'm here.

214
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:57,333
Because you and Rin
are connected.

215
00:09:57,416 --> 00:09:59,125
Just get to the point, Sosuke.

216
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:01,041
Rin needs you, Haruka.

217
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:04,041
When he competes with you,
he's at his best.

218
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,291
You help him reach
his full potential.

219
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:07,208
I don't get you, man.

220
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:10,416
Why are you so
hung up on Rin?

221
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,000
My career is over.

222
00:10:12,083 --> 00:10:15,000
But he could still compete
on the world level.

223
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:17,541
I want to see him
do what I can't.

224
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,916
[HARUKA gasps]

225
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,416
[SOSUKE] Most people would kill
to have the ability you have.

226
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:23,875
And it sucks to watch
you sit there

227
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:27,500
and do nothing with it.
You have talent! Use it!

228
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,500
[HARUKA gasps]

229
00:10:29,583 --> 00:10:32,375
[SOSUKE] That's all I
wanted to say. Later.

230
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:39,875
[MAKOTO]
Haru!

231
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,333
What's up?

232
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:45,500
[MAKOTO] You and I haven't
walked home together in a while.

233
00:10:45,583 --> 00:10:48,041
I mean, at least since you
started swimming by yourself

234
00:10:48,125 --> 00:10:50,208
after practice every day.

235
00:10:50,291 --> 00:10:52,666
[HARUKA] What were you
doing up at school so late?

236
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,000
Oh, I was...

237
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:57,333
It was nothing important,
I was just talkin'

238
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,833
with Miss A about
some stuff. No big deal.

239
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,250
[HARUKA]
Okay.

240
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:05,000
[MAKOTO]
Obon's nearly here.

241
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,083
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

242
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,083
[MAKOTO]
Will your parents be home soon?

243
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,958
[HARUKA]
Not till the end of summer.

244
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:14,208
[MAKOTO laughs] They're free
spirits just like you.

245
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:15,625
Haru!

246
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:17,458
Let's go to the
Fireworks Festival.

247
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:19,958
We can invite
Nagisa and Rei, too!

248
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,583
That sounds fun.

249
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,333
Well, bye.

250
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:27,250
Hey, wait!

251
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,916
[HARUKA]
Hm?

252
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,208
I was thinking...

253
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,791
About what'll happen
when we graduate.

254
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:34,416
I don't really wanna
talk about that.

255
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,541
No! Uh-- It's not
what you think!

256
00:11:36,625 --> 00:11:37,708

Big brother!

257
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:39,208
[MAKOTO]
Whoa!

258
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,541
[REN]
Hi!

259
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:41,416
[RAN] Hope you're hungry,
'cause dinner's ready!

260
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,166
Hey, you should come eat, too!

261
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,166
Yeah, we have plenty of food!

262
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:47,083
Today's not a good day for me.

263
00:11:47,166 --> 00:11:48,333
[RAN]
Aw!

264
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:49,958
[REN] You promise you'll
eat with us next time?

265
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,791

Deal.

266
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,750
[REN, RAN]
Good night, Haru.

267
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:58,541
[NITORI panting]

268
00:11:58,625 --> 00:12:01,208
[MOMOTARO]
Hmm.

269
00:12:01,291 --> 00:12:03,208
Momo, what the heck do
you think you're doing?

270
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:04,458
I'm glad you're here.

271
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:06,083
Which of these shirts do
you think I should wear?

272
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,333
[NITORI] The team meeting's
about to start! Hurry up!

273
00:12:08,416 --> 00:12:11,250
[MOMOTARO] Hey!
Hold on, wait for me, man!

274
00:12:11,333 --> 00:12:13,500
[MOMOTARO, NITORI panting]

275
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,416
--[MOMOTARO] Guys! I'm sorry!
--[RIN] You're late.

276
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,041
All right, so is
everybody here now?

277
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,958
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

278
00:12:19,041 --> 00:12:20,791
[RIN] Starting today,
we'll have a one-week break

279
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:24,041
from club activities. The next
time we'll all be together again

280
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:27,708
is at the national tournament.
Those of you who are competing

281
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,708
will get there two days
early to practice

282
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,833
and make any final adjustments.

283
00:12:31,916 --> 00:12:34,166
Until then, let's make sure
we all get plenty of rest.

284
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,041
So, do you guys think
you can handle that?

285
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:37,708
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Sir, yes sir!

286
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,083
Coach Sasabe.

287
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,791
Thank you so much for
coming by on your holiday.

288
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:50,625
I know it means
the world to them.

289
00:12:50,708 --> 00:12:52,208
No problem.

290
00:12:52,291 --> 00:12:53,750
Things have been so crazy at the
pool, this is the only chance

291
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,458
I'll have to work with them
'fore they leave for Nationals.

292
00:12:56,541 --> 00:12:57,875
But, man...

293
00:12:58,875 --> 00:13:00,000
[AMAKATA]
Is something wrong?

294
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,375
[GOU]
Everybody pay attention.

295
00:13:01,458 --> 00:13:02,916
I took the liberty
of creating a chart

296
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,833
that shows all of
your race times.

297
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,250
But according to this, our times

298
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:08,875
aren't really
improving that much.

299
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,541
[GOU] Yes, I know.
These stats are after Regionals.

300
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:13,791
Individual times have
improved quite a bit.

301
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,625
But for some strange reason,
your relay times

302
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,000
have leveled off.

303
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,291
[HARUKA] I don't understand,
how is that possible?

304
00:13:19,375 --> 00:13:21,833
[NAGISA] Does this mean we do
worse when we swim together?

305
00:13:21,916 --> 00:13:23,250
[REI]
That can't be true!

306
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,166
[GOU] Whatever it means,
it's a problem.

307
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,375
To start with, Coach Sasabe
is going to adjust

308
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,666
your training regimen.
Let's hope we can pin point

309
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,250
the root of the problem
and deal with it

310
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:33,583
before Nationals next week.

311
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:36,958
[UOZUMI]
Catch ya later!

312
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,000
[MINAMI]
Bye!

313
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,500
Don't forget to
bring me something!

314
00:13:48,958 --> 00:13:50,291
Hey, Rin. Let's go.

315
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:52,083
If we don't hurry,
we'll be late.

316
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:53,791
Yeah. I know.

317
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,666
You guys, wait!
You're totally about to walk

318
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,875
to the train station together
and go home, am I right?

319
00:13:57,958 --> 00:13:59,916
Your houses must
be really close!

320
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:00,916
[SOSUKE]
Yikes.

321
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:02,250
What do you want?

322
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,833
Well, thing is,
there's something

323
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:07,291
I want you to give Gou for me.
It's Pyunsuke, my pet beetle.

324
00:14:07,375 --> 00:14:09,708
Tell her to take care of him.

325
00:14:09,791 --> 00:14:11,916
[RIN, SOUSUKE]
Oh, boy.

326
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,416
[MOMOTARO]
Hey!

327
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,541
How about I release him back
into the mountains instead?

328
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:18,500
[MOMOTARO] Ah! Don't even joke
about my sweet little Pyunsuke

329
00:14:18,583 --> 00:14:19,583
like that, you jerk!

330
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:22,125
I've raised him
since he was a larva!

331
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,000
I harvested sap,
gave him protein jelly,

332
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,583
monitored the
temperature in his cage...

333
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:27,375
Makoto?

334
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:34,208
[NAGISA groans]
I'm beat!

335
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:37,666
[REI] In that case, how 'bout
the two of us call it a day?

336
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:39,875
No wait, let's power
through this next page

337
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:43,458
before we decide to quit!
One less thing to do tomorrow!

338
00:14:43,541 --> 00:14:45,333
[REI]
Wow, I'm impressed.

339
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,250
There was a time you'd have
been the first to pull the plug.

340
00:14:48,333 --> 00:14:50,208
I guess I'm turnin'
over a new leaf.

341
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,666
The new me promised to do well
in the pool and the classroom!

342
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,458
An admirable view.

343
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:58,375
But I suggest we take a break
before we delve in any deeper.

344
00:14:58,458 --> 00:15:00,666
[NAGISA] Okay! But only
if it's a short one!

345
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:03,750
[NAGISA yawns]

346
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,375
Whoa! What is this?

347
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,166
Remember? Haruka carved
it out of wood

348
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:10,375
to get people to join
Swim Club last year.

349
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,166
Pretty impressive craftsmanship,
if you ask me.

350
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:16,166
I remember, I just can't
believe you kept it!

351
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,250
Seems like forever ago.

352
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,625
It's amazing that he went to all
the trouble of carving these

353
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:23,125
just to make sure the
club had enough members.

354
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:24,625
Yeah.

355
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,875
[NAGISA] I wonder if we'll get
any new members next year.

356
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:28,958
I don't think we'll have
to worry about it too much.

357
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,291
Now that we've
made it to Nationals,

358
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,625
everyone and their grandmother
will want to join.

359
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:34,291
We'll have to turn people away.

360
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,125
They'll be coming out
in droves, I guarantee it!

361
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:40,083
But, after Nationals,
Makoto and Haru

362
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,666
will be moving on.

363
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:44,333
It'll just be the
two of us for a bit.

364
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:49,916
[NAGISA]
I wonder what Haru is gonna do.

365
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,875
[REI]
Hey, Nagisa.

366
00:15:51,958 --> 00:15:53,458
What do you want for Haru?

367
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,708
If you could choose his future,
what would you wish for?

368
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,791
Well, I imagine
the same as you.

369
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:00,916
I just want him to be himself,
but more than anything,

370
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,625
I hope he's happy
with his choices.

371
00:16:03,708 --> 00:16:04,916
I don't know.

372
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,250
It makes me sad to see him
struggle like this.

373
00:16:07,333 --> 00:16:09,291
I feel the same way.

374
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,708
This is the last
tournament the four of us

375
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,333
will ever swim together.

376
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:16,458
I want to be certain
Haruka's in a good place.

377
00:16:16,541 --> 00:16:17,583
Me too.

378
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:19,250
Maybe we should say
something to him.

379
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,333
We're his friends.

380
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,250
We have to let him
know how we feel.

381
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,708
If it were me,
that's what I would want

382
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:25,750
you guys to do.

383
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:33,083
[MAKOTO]
Haru!

384
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:35,791
Hey, can we come in?

385
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,916
Sorry to drop in
on you like this!

386
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,125
We thought you might
like to come

387
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,083
watch the Fireworks show.

388
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,333
Uh... 'Kay.

389
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,708
[REI, NAGISA]
Wow.

390
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,625
My, this is beautiful.

391
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:01,791
Yep.

392
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:08,125
Hey, Haruka.

393
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:09,458
What is it?

394
00:17:09,541 --> 00:17:11,708
There's something we need
to talk about as a team.

395
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:13,416
And we need to do
it now, before we swim

396
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:14,833
in the national tournament.

397
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:17,458
Because if we don't,
then I don't think

398
00:17:17,541 --> 00:17:19,416
we have a chance of winning.

399
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,958
[REI]
Haruka, listen.

400
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,291
You're an incredible swimmer.

401
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:24,375
Nagisa and I agree,
you're the best freestyler

402
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:25,583
we've ever seen.

403
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,166
But now that you're not
swimming freestyle,

404
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,541
something has changed,
and not for the better.

405
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:32,416
Simply put, you're not
yourself anymore.

406
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,625
Truth is, we just want you
to compete at the next level.

407
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,708
To swim in front of people
from all over the country.

408
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:41,625
'Cause the world should
know how amazing you are.

409
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,000
Don't you see?

410
00:17:43,083 --> 00:17:44,833
You have the power
to inspire people

411
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:48,250
to pursue dreams of their own.

412
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,666
Make no mistake, when the
world sees talent, it's moved.

413
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:54,750
Exactly as we were the first
time we watched you swim.

414
00:17:54,833 --> 00:17:57,500
People all over will aspire
to reach your level.

415
00:17:57,583 --> 00:18:01,250
Is there anything more
beautiful than inspiring others?

416
00:18:01,333 --> 00:18:03,958
[MAKOTO]
Haru, they've got a point.

417
00:18:06,916 --> 00:18:09,208
I wish I could see
what you mean.

418
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,250
[NAGISA]
Will he be okay?

419
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:17,750
I sure hope so, Nagisa.

420
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:31,333
I thought I might find you here.

421
00:18:34,333 --> 00:18:37,458
Haru. Listen to me.

422
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:41,458
You can't keep
going on like this.

423
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:44,083
'Til now, I've always figured,
"if he says he's okay,

424
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:48,250
then that's the way things are."
I ignored what Rin said.

425
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:51,791
I wanted to be considerate
of you and your feelings.

426
00:18:51,875 --> 00:18:54,291
But then, I overheard
something you said to him

427
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,000
in the locker room at Regionals.

428
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:59,333
[HARUKA] What "future?"
What is it you think I have?

429
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,166
This is my life, not yours!

430
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,333
I'm not you!

431
00:19:02,416 --> 00:19:03,916
I'm never going to be you!

432
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,416
This is your life.

433
00:19:05,500 --> 00:19:07,375
And if what you really want
is for me to stay out of it,

434
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,625
then I can do that.

435
00:19:08,708 --> 00:19:10,958
All you have to do
is say the word.

436
00:19:11,041 --> 00:19:12,541
But, if you're stuck

437
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,666
'cause you can't
find your dream,

438
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,291
that's different.

439
00:19:16,375 --> 00:19:22,458
I only want you to know that
I'm here to help you find it.

440
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:25,041
You're here to
"help me find it?"

441
00:19:25,125 --> 00:19:26,750
You can find it just by looking?

442
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,250
Is that how simple
a dream really is?

443
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:30,458
[MAKOTO]
I don't know.

444
00:19:30,541 --> 00:19:31,791
[HARUKA]
Thanks, but no.

445
00:19:31,875 --> 00:19:34,208
Let's not talk
about this anymore.

446
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:34,833
[MAKOTO]
Hold on.

447
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,875
Let go of me!

448
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,375
Don't walk away,
listen to me, Haru!

449
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,083
Why? It won't change anything!

450
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:41,916
A dream's not something
you stumble across.

451
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:43,833
I'm fine just the way I am!

452
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:45,208
That's a lie!

453
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,458
You wanna find your dream too,
you're just afraid!

454
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,333
So stop being
a coward, already!

455
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,708
All you have to do is go out
into the world and find it.

456
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:53,500
You have enough
talent to do that!

457
00:19:53,583 --> 00:19:56,166
Why does everyone wanna
talk about my talent, huh?

458
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:58,666
Where I swim,
and who I swim for--

459
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,000
This is my business
and nobody else's!

460
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,333
I said I'm fine,
so just leave me alone!

00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:05,375
Oh come on, Haru,
that's a load of crap!

[HARUKA gasps]

463
00:20:06,375 --> 00:20:07,208
You're not fine
and you know it,

464
00:20:07,291 --> 00:20:08,958
that's why they're all worried!

that we love you?

00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,916
You're important to
every single one of us.

470
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,458
So why do you keep
pushing us all away?

471
00:20:20,541 --> 00:20:22,250
Because we want you
to find your dream?

472
00:20:22,333 --> 00:20:24,250
Because we want you to have
a successful future?

473
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,750
Tch!

474
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:27,291
[HARUKA] You're one to talk
to me about having a future!

475
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,666
What does the future
have in store, Makoto?

476
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:31,583
[MAKOTO gasps]

477
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
You see? You don't know.

478
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:36,666
So, for the last time,
would you leave me alone?

479
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,583
You got no right saying
these things to me

480
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:41,541
when you don't
even know yourself!

481
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:43,541
It just makes you a hypocrite.

482
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,708
[MAKOTO]
You're wrong.

483
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:50,541
[HARUKA]
Huh?

484
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,916
Dead wrong.

485
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,541
I'm going to college in Tokyo.

486
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:56,833
[fireworks whistling]

487
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,458
[MAKOTO]
I've been meaning to tell you.

488
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:05,500
I just couldn't find the
right words, I suppose.

489
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,541
Look, man...

490
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,958
I couldn't care
less what you do!

491
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:14,375
[MAKOTO]
Haru!

492
00:22:52,041 --> 00:23:00,333
[doorbell ringing]

493
00:23:00,416 --> 00:23:03,166
This had better be good.

494
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:04,250
[HARUKA]
Rin?

495
00:23:04,333 --> 00:23:06,833
Haru, wake up.
We're going somewhere.

496
00:23:06,916 --> 00:23:08,000
[HARUKA]
Uh...

497
00:23:08,083 --> 00:23:09,208
[RIN] Don't just
stand there. Get dressed.

498
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,333
We're gonna be late.

499
00:23:10,416 --> 00:23:12,000
Wait a sec, where are we going?

500
00:23:12,083 --> 00:23:15,291
[RIN]
You might wanna pack a bag.

501
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:17,583
'Cause we're
headed to Australia.

502
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:24,208
[RIN] From the moment I first
met you, my world opened up.

503
00:23:24,291 --> 00:23:27,541
I could see all the
possibilities before me.

504
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,333
If you open your eyes
and lift up your head

505
00:23:29,416 --> 00:23:32,458
you should be able
to see it too, Haru!

506
00:23:32,541 --> 00:23:35,875
Next time:
"Swim-Off in a Foreign Land!"

507
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:39,375
[HARUKA] But when I close
my eyes, I see something else.
