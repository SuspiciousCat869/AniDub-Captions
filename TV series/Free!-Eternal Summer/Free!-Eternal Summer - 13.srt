1
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:12,833
[MAKOTO]
Haru!

2
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:13,958
Rin!

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,291
[RIN]
Hey, Makoto!

4
00:00:15,375 --> 00:00:17,625
Long way to come just to
see us get off the plane.

5
00:00:17,708 --> 00:00:19,875
Bet you guys are pretty
wiped out from the trip.

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,666
Uh... I-I...

7
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:24,250
[MAKOTO]
Haru.

8
00:00:24,333 --> 00:00:25,583
Huh?

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,916
It's good to see you.

10
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,583
Good to see you, too.

11
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,625
So, uh. What do you
say we get goin'?

12
00:00:48,666 --> 00:00:49,791
So, ya think we're finally

13
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,250
getting our heads around
this pool, or what?

14
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:54,041
Yeah. And just imagine
two days from now

15
00:00:54,125 --> 00:00:56,833
when these stands'll be
filled with spectators!

16
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:58,583
Sounds like someone's
gettin' nervous.

17
00:00:58,666 --> 00:01:00,166
Oh, please.

18
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,083
No, it just happens to be a day
we've all worked very hard for.

19
00:01:02,166 --> 00:01:04,708
I am as far from nervous
as it's possible to be!

20
00:01:04,791 --> 00:01:06,958
So you've finally grown
some hair on your chest!

21
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:08,750
Why do you--?

22
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:11,041
Makoto will be back with
them any minute now!

23
00:01:11,125 --> 00:01:14,125
Whoa. Guess we
lost track of time.

24
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,416
C'mon, man.

25
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:17,041
I can't help but wonder.

26
00:01:17,125 --> 00:01:20,041
Do you really think the trip
had a positive effect on Haru?

27
00:01:20,125 --> 00:01:21,458
[NAGISA]
Sure it did!

28
00:01:21,541 --> 00:01:23,583
He just needed a little
change of scenery, that's all.

29
00:01:23,666 --> 00:01:26,041
You'll see!

30
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:27,333
[REI]
Right!

31
00:01:28,541 --> 00:01:29,708
[MAKOTO]
Guys are here.

32
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:31,250
Thought it'd be good to
get to know the space.

33
00:01:31,333 --> 00:01:33,541
You know, since
tomorrow's the big day.

34
00:01:39,875 --> 00:01:42,291
Well, I'm gonna go
meet up with my team, so,

35
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:43,625
see ya.

36
00:01:45,333 --> 00:01:46,541
[HARUKA]
Rin!

37
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:49,708
Thanks a lot, man.

38
00:01:52,916 --> 00:01:54,125
No worries.

39
00:01:57,208 --> 00:01:58,083
[MAKOTO]
Hey!

40
00:01:58,166 --> 00:01:59,250
[REI, NAGISA]
Hm?

41
00:01:59,333 --> 00:02:00,458
[NAGISA]
Haru!

42
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:02,208
[REI]
Welcome back!

43
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:03,833
[HARUKA]
Hi, Rei. Nagisa.

44
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:06,083
Hope the trip was cool!
Glad you made it home!

45
00:02:06,166 --> 00:02:08,666
And more importantly,
that you made it home safe.

46
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,416
[NAGISA]
You are such a mother-hen, Rei.

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,875
He was super stressed out
about you the whole time.

48
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,458
[REI]
Shut up!

49
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:18,208
I'm sorry I made you guys
worry about me.

50
00:02:18,291 --> 00:02:19,625
No biggie.

51
00:02:19,708 --> 00:02:21,583
Just do us all a favor and
get plenty of rest before

52
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:23,958
the big tournament,
it is only two days away.

53
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,833
Of course, we still need to
make a few minor adjustments.

54
00:02:26,916 --> 00:02:28,041
[NAGISA]
That's true.

55
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:29,458
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

56
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:34,083
Nagisa, Rei. We need to talk.

57
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:35,750
It's important.

58
00:02:38,375 --> 00:02:40,833
[HARUKA] 'Til now, I was
never really concerned

59
00:02:40,916 --> 00:02:42,916
about winning or
losing, you know?

60
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,875
I just swam 'cause I wanted to.

61
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:47,875
I thought if I made it
about tweaking my speed,

62
00:02:47,958 --> 00:02:51,916
or beating the other team or
whatever, what'd be the point?

63
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,625
Rin wants to swim at the
international level.

64
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:58,750
He's diving into that world
head-first after we graduate.

65
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,250
But, that's his thing.

66
00:03:00,333 --> 00:03:02,416
Should I follow his
example if I just wanna

67
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,250
keep swimming,
or is that a compromise?

68
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:07,875
Is it for me to
care about winning?

69
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:11,500
I don't think so. I'm not Rin.

70
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:15,000
I don't have the
competitive streak he does.

71
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:20,250
[HARUKA]
So, that's why I couldn't answer

72
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,541
when you asked what my plan was.

73
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,208
I didn't have a clue.

74
00:03:25,291 --> 00:03:28,875
Didn't think a dream was
something you could just grab.

75
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:31,750
But then, Rin took
me to Australia,

76
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:33,666
showed me all this
amazing stuff.

77
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,000
And suddenly it
was like-- I dunno.

78
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:41,250
[RIN] What makes a dream
really and truly yours?

79
00:03:41,333 --> 00:03:44,666
[HARUKA] I felt it, like the
world got a lot bigger.

80
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,583
And me? I'd found
my place in it.

81
00:03:51,291 --> 00:03:53,875
I wanna swim for
the rest of my life.

82
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,250
And if that means I gotta
start caring about times

83
00:03:56,333 --> 00:03:59,458
and tournaments and all the
things that come with it.

84
00:03:59,541 --> 00:04:02,541
That's fine with me.

85
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,583
Wow, that's quite a change
of heart for you, dude.

86
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,791
Sounds like the trip with
Rin was a real eye opener.

87
00:04:06,875 --> 00:04:08,541
I knew it was gonna work out!

88
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,583
If you've found your path,
then far be it from us

89
00:04:10,666 --> 00:04:12,291
to give you anything
but support.

90
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,875
You better believe we'll be
cheering you on all the way!

91
00:04:15,958 --> 00:04:17,291
I know you will.

92
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,958
Thanks.

93
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,708
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Good morning!

94
00:04:22,791 --> 00:04:23,958
[RIN]
Hey.

95
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:25,750
Hope you had a good trip
there and back, Captain!

96
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:27,083
It was awesome.

97
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,250
Been any earth-shattering
changes since I left?

98
00:04:29,333 --> 00:04:30,500
No, sir-- I mean, Rin--
we've been--

99
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,458
What'd you get me?

100
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,666
Can I have my
souvenir now?

101
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:35,125
Subtle. Nice.

102
00:04:35,208 --> 00:04:37,500
Why not? Sure.
Knock yourself out.

103
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,416
Awesome! It's a boomerang!

104
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,583
[RIN, NITORI laugh]

105
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:41,666
[UOZUMI]
Dude, that's perfect for you.

106
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:42,625
[MOMOTARO]
G'day, mate!

107
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:44,166
Hey is Sosuke around?

108
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,208
[NITORI] He said he'll
catch up with us after a while.

109
00:04:49,458 --> 00:04:51,500
[MAKOTO]
We're here. Do you believe it?

110
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,666
It still feels like a dream.

111
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,333
Makoto, I--

112
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,000
[HARUKA] The other day, I said
some really stupid things.

113
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,916
I didn't mean any of 'em.

114
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,083
I'm sorry.

115
00:05:08,166 --> 00:05:09,708
Haru...

116
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,625
If anybody's sorry, it's me.

117
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:16,875
We've been through a lot.

118
00:05:16,958 --> 00:05:18,875
I oughta be able
to talk to my friend.

119
00:05:18,958 --> 00:05:20,375
Seriously.

120
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,500
I should've told you what
my plans were before I did.

121
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:27,041
Truth is, competition isn't my
thing. I'd been thinking about

122
00:05:27,125 --> 00:05:28,916
just fallin' back
on community college

123
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,708
or something. Didn't know
how to bring it up.

124
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,791
Sucks when you don't know

125
00:05:33,875 --> 00:05:37,541
what you wanna
do with your life.

126
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:39,750
Then, Coach Sasabe
gave me that job

127
00:05:39,833 --> 00:05:42,333
coaching little
kids at the club.

128
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:43,791
It was nothing special at first,

129
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,541
just 'em helping
him out and stuff.

130
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,291
I figured it was the least I
could do to repay him, ya know?

131
00:05:48,375 --> 00:05:50,750
But then the kids
changed all of that.

132
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,541
I met Hayato,
and for some reason

133
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,416
I really wanted to
help him learn to swim.

134
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,000
I was clueless at first.

135
00:05:58,083 --> 00:06:00,666
But your advice actually made
more difference than you think.

136
00:06:00,750 --> 00:06:02,208
[HARUKA]
Not like it was that profound.

137
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:03,708
[MAKOTO chuckles]

138
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:06,625
[MAKOTO] Well, the kid learned
how to do the backstroke.

139
00:06:06,708 --> 00:06:08,541
And the look on his
face when he did;

140
00:06:08,625 --> 00:06:11,416
I'd never seen anything
like it before in my life.

141
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,833
He was so proud of himself.

142
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:16,541
From that moment I was hooked.

143
00:06:16,625 --> 00:06:18,458
That's when I knew I
wanted to help kids feel

144
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:22,125
a sense of accomplishment,
take pride in themselves.

145
00:06:28,375 --> 00:06:29,500
[MAKOTO]
I was put on this Earth

146
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:31,833
to bring first-timers
to the water.

147
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,583
After graduation,
I'm gonna go to college

148
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:35,625
in Tokyo to make it happen.

149
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,125
That's my dream.
That's what I'm reaching for.

150
00:06:41,208 --> 00:06:42,500
Not bad.

151
00:06:42,583 --> 00:06:45,541
You do realize you're gonna
be awesome at it, right?

152
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,666
You really think so?
Thanks, man.

153
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,875
It'll be the hardest
thing I've ever done.

154
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:52,791
[HARUKA]
No kidding.

155
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:54,166
[MAKOTO laughs]

156
00:06:57,666 --> 00:06:59,125
[MOMOTARO gasps]

157
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,083
[SOSUKE] Give yourself
more time to recover.

158
00:07:01,166 --> 00:07:02,458
Your center of balance is off.

159
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,500
[MOMOTARO]
Sosuke!

160
00:07:04,583 --> 00:07:06,250
Oh, hey.

161
00:07:06,333 --> 00:07:09,083
Sorry I'm late. Got here
as soon as I could.

162
00:07:09,166 --> 00:07:10,958
So, Australia. Good?

163
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:13,458
Oh, yeah, it's incredible.

164
00:07:14,875 --> 00:07:15,958
[SOSUKE]
Man.

165
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:17,708
Kind of a long way
to go to make a point.

166
00:07:17,791 --> 00:07:20,750
Yeah, well. It's worth it.

167
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,291
And I'd do it all again
in a heartbeat.

168
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:28,958
[NAGISA laughs]

169
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,916
Bet you would.

170
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:39,833
[AMAKATA]
Alright, boys! Special occasion.

171
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:42,500
Tomorrow's the big day.
So pick anything on the menu.

172
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:43,458
My treat.

173
00:07:43,541 --> 00:07:44,541
[BOYS]
Whoa!

174
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:46,458
Wow, that's incredibly
generous of you!

175
00:07:46,541 --> 00:07:48,375
Alrighty, then! Seafood salad,

176
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:50,791
garlic potato salad,
beer-battered fish n' chips,

177
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:51,875
roast beef,

178
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,500
french onion soup,
Yorkshire pudding,

179
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:56,208
chicken alfredo,
pasta pescatore, unagi,

180
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,958
sweet potato fries
with truffle oil,

181
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,208
three cheese omelet,
porcini cream risotto,

182
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,666
lobster mac n' cheese,
oysters on the half shell,

183
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:03,458
swordfish--

184
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,958
[AMAKATA]
Okay, okay!

185
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:07,291
Mac n' cheese sounds absolutely
delicious, let's do that.

186
00:08:07,375 --> 00:08:09,375
But what do you say we
try it without the lobster?

187
00:08:09,458 --> 00:08:10,625
[NAGISA]
But!

188
00:08:10,708 --> 00:08:12,666
Easy, she is doing this
on a teacher's salary.

189
00:08:12,750 --> 00:08:13,833
They have mackerel here?

190
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:14,833
Uh, I don't think

191
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,250
they're that sort
of place, dude.

192
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,791
[REI] Hmm. They have
mackerel meuniere.

193
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:19,583
[HARUKA]
Not salt-grilled?

194
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:20,708
Is it just me or is there

195
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,625
something different
about Haru?

196
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:24,375
Not that it's any of my
business, but I'd noticed

197
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,875
the gang being a little
short with each other lately.

198
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:29,041
I think the trip to
Australia with my brother

199
00:08:29,125 --> 00:08:31,708
did him a lot of good.

200
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,458
[AMAKATA]
I should say so.

201
00:08:34,541 --> 00:08:35,666
[HARUKA]
Why don't they have sashimi?

202
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,041
[REI]
Sashimi?

203
00:08:37,125 --> 00:08:39,500
He seems in a better place.

204
00:08:39,583 --> 00:08:41,083
I'm glad.

205
00:08:44,208 --> 00:08:45,791
[NAGISA]
What a meal!

206
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,083
I'm surprised you can still move

207
00:08:47,166 --> 00:08:48,708
with all the food
you packed away.

208
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:49,791
Ah, I'm good.

209
00:08:49,875 --> 00:08:52,083
I'm still growin',
so I gotta eat!

210
00:08:52,166 --> 00:08:53,208
We believe you.

211
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:54,750
Oh, honestly.

212
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:56,458
With how you put it away, you'll
sink straight to the bottom.

213
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:59,458
We don't need you cramping
up at the tournament.

214
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,541
[NAGISA]
Whoa! It's so beautiful!

215
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:05,875
[REI]
Yes it is.

216
00:09:05,958 --> 00:09:08,500
[MAKOTO] The ocean looks
completely different here.

217
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,750
Tomorrow really is the day.

218
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,541
[MAKOTO]
Gives you chills, doesn't it?

219
00:09:15,625 --> 00:09:18,208
I mean, when you think back
to when this all started.

220
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,875
None of us ever imagined
that we'd make it this far.

221
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:23,958
We couldn't even use
our own pool at first.

222
00:09:24,041 --> 00:09:25,208
[NAGISA]
That's right.

223
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,125
The whole thing started
with us fixing it up.

224
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:30,541
Haru was obsessed.
He'd have done anything to swim.

225
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,625
[NAGISA giggles] Oh, man!
Remember at the hardware store?

226
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:35,333
You started stripping
down to your skivvies

227
00:09:35,416 --> 00:09:36,708
in front of the fish tanks.

228
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,250
[REI]
Ugh. Glad I wasn't there.

229
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,416
[MAKOTO laughs]
Yeah, you weren't with us yet,

230
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,250
were you, Rei? I forgot
that was before your time.

231
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,958
You'd originally gone
with the track team,

232
00:09:45,041 --> 00:09:45,750
isn't that right?

233
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,166
Indeed.

234
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,375
Your little Swim Club made
absolutely no sense to me.

235
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,875
But then, Nagisa asked
me to join.

236
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,416
And seeing Haru swim,
I couldn't resist.

237
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:57,625
Of course, I couldn't
hold my own with any of you,

238
00:09:57,708 --> 00:09:58,791
remember that?

239
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:01,875
At training camp,
Makoto had to rescue me.

240
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:05,458
[REI]
I shudder to think

241
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,583
what I would have
become without you all.

242
00:10:07,666 --> 00:10:10,541
Relay swimming isn't just fun,
it's become a way life.

243
00:10:10,625 --> 00:10:13,291
It helped me find
who I really am.

244
00:10:13,375 --> 00:10:14,541
Aw.

245
00:10:14,625 --> 00:10:16,416
This wouldn't have been
possible without Nagisa.

246
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:17,916
It was his idea
to start the club.

247
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,291
Okay, come on, you gotta stop.
I'm gonna blush.

248
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,791
None of us would
be here without you,

249
00:10:21,875 --> 00:10:23,250
you know that, right?

250
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:25,125
And look at you now.
Not that long ago

251
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:26,625
you were a runaway.

252
00:10:26,708 --> 00:10:28,875
[REI] And yet, here you are,
grade point average soaring,

253
00:10:28,958 --> 00:10:34,000
and the club you founded making
it all the way to Nationals.

254
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:35,250
Look at yourself.

255
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,250
I mean, Rei,
you had a rough start.

256
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:39,333
In the early days,
you swam like a boat anchor.

257
00:10:39,416 --> 00:10:41,750
And now, your butterfly
stroke is untouchable!

258
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,750
Even when your goggles
came off that one time!

259
00:10:43,833 --> 00:10:45,708
[REI] That was a decidedly
less than beautiful moment.

260
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:47,708
[NAGISA]
Whatever! It was fantastic!

261
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,375
[MAKOTO] You hit your stride
with butterfly and now,

262
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,291
there's not a stroke you
can't do. You should be proud.

263
00:10:52,375 --> 00:10:53,916
Well, yes.

264
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,541
But without Rin's help, I would
never would've dreamed of-- Uh--

265
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,541
[NAGISA]
Dude. We've known for a while.

266
00:10:58,625 --> 00:10:59,750
[REI]
Really?

267
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,166
Sorry, Rei. We know
you were trying to

268
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,000
keep that whole
night lesson thing secret.

269
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:04,875
Uh... You might've
said something

270
00:11:04,958 --> 00:11:09,541
and spared me the embarrassment.
I don't think the man

271
00:11:09,625 --> 00:11:13,375
will ever know how
enormously grateful I am.

272
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:17,000
Well, man, you aren't
the only one who owes him.

273
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:20,208
I'd lost my way for a bit
when Rin showed up again.

274
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:22,916
Only thing I cared about was me.

275
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,875
But, Rin brought me out of
the funk I'd put myself in,

276
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:28,000
made me realize
how you guys felt.

277
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:31,375
What it really meant
to swim as a team.

278
00:11:31,458 --> 00:11:33,375
Things were so
different back then.

279
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:36,791
That first relay with all of you
really opened my eyes, no joke.

280
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,375
Remember how nervous we were?

281
00:11:38,458 --> 00:11:41,750
It was hard enough just
learning how to swim together.

282
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,750
But it wasn't too long before
we started competing

283
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:45,208
in actual tournaments.

284
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,791
Man, we had so much fun
that first time out, right?

285
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:48,958
Oh, yes.

286
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,833
Except of course
losing to Samezuka

287
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:53,333
proved to be a rather
bitter pill to swallow.

288
00:11:53,416 --> 00:11:54,666
Ah yeah.

289
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:57,083
You seriously lit a fire
under us after that, Rei.

290
00:11:57,166 --> 00:11:59,666
So we started practicing
our exchanges for Regionals.

291
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,250
Talk about hard work payin' off

292
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,916
when push came to shove! Hey!
We keep doing like we're doing,

293
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,625
next year Regionals
won't know what hit 'em!

294
00:12:05,708 --> 00:12:08,166
We'll kill it at training camp,
set new records--

295
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:11,500
The four of us are
unbeatable! Am I right?

296
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,416
Well, except it won't
be the four of us then.

297
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,458
Tomorrow's the last race
these two will swim

298
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:19,000
before they graduate.

299
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,416
Oh... Oh, yeah.

300
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:23,958
Things will be different.

301
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:28,166
Daily practice, training camp,
the tournaments, all of it.

302
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:31,791
Who knows when the four of us
might swim together, again?

303
00:12:31,875 --> 00:12:33,458
Ever...

304
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,250
Dude, are you--?

305
00:12:38,333 --> 00:12:41,250
[REI]
Oh. How awkward.

306
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:43,666
Rei, come on...

307
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,291
No. Screw this. This sucks!

308
00:12:48,375 --> 00:12:51,000
Why can't things
stay the way they are?

309
00:12:51,083 --> 00:12:53,041
We've been through so much!

310
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:55,583
We've come so far!

311
00:12:55,666 --> 00:12:58,000
I want us to swim
together forever!

312
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:00,708
I do, too! I can't do this!

313
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,625
I learned to swim for us,
