00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:26,666
[RIN]
Sosuke.

3
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,125
[SOSUKE]
Hm?

4
00:00:28,208 --> 00:00:29,583
We should probably hurry,
the bus is about to leave.

5
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,666
There's still a lot of
racing to do tomorrow.

6
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,583
We need to get back
and debrief, ASAP.

7
00:00:34,666 --> 00:00:36,625
[SOSUKE]
Yeah, I know.

8
00:00:36,708 --> 00:00:39,125
Is there something on your mind?

9
00:00:39,208 --> 00:00:40,916
Just a blast from the past.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,291
Huh?

11
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,416
I'm kidding.

12
00:02:23,583 --> 00:02:27,041
[GOU]
Yes. Perfect.

13
00:02:27,125 --> 00:02:28,875
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Gou!

14
00:02:28,958 --> 00:02:31,083
Yeah?

15
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:34,333
[AMAKATA] You practiced
like the Dickens today.

16
00:02:34,416 --> 00:02:35,625
[REI]
I don't believe I've ever seen

17
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:37,916
so many carbohydrates
stacked in one place.

18
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,541
[GOU]
Yep. That's the whole point.

19
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:42,583
A carb-heavy menu is what
you need before a big race.

20
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:45,083
Hey, good call, Gou.
Where's the protein?

21
00:02:45,166 --> 00:02:46,958
Oh, uh. Only carbs.

22
00:02:47,041 --> 00:02:48,125
If you want some powder,
though, I--

23
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:49,833
[MAKOTO]
Put that crap away right now!

24
00:02:49,916 --> 00:02:51,833
I'm incredibly proud
of you boys.

25
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,541
How amazing is it that you're
all advancing to regionals?

26
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,500
My coaching may have had
somethin' to do with that.

27
00:02:56,583 --> 00:02:58,000
Uh-huh...

28
00:02:58,083 --> 00:03:00,291
Not to sound ungrateful or
anything, but you were so busy

29
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:02,541
with ISCR, we've barely
seen you at practice.

30
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:06,000
[SASABE laughs] Hey, a good
coach knows when to let his team

31
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:07,416
find their own way.

32
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:10,500
The important thing is,
you've all learned how. Period.

33
00:03:10,583 --> 00:03:12,166
We can pretty much
accomplish anything

34
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,208
we put our minds to,
that's what I've learned!

35
00:03:14,291 --> 00:03:17,083
And I've learned there's
such a thing as protein excess.

36
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:18,583
On another note,
it must be said,

37
00:03:18,666 --> 00:03:20,625
you were exceptionally
awesome today, Haru.

38
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:22,416
Nicely done!

39
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,583
Yeah, well.

40
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,250
[REI]
Don't shrug it off, my friend!

41
00:03:25,333 --> 00:03:26,625
You broke records out there.

42
00:03:26,708 --> 00:03:28,583
That's not the sort of thing
that happens every day!

43
00:03:28,666 --> 00:03:30,916
[SASABE]
Tomorrow's the medley relay.

44
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,208
With this kind of momentum,

45
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:35,000
you guys just might
take Samezuka down a peg!

46
00:03:36,666 --> 00:03:38,791
Honestly, the prospect of
officially going head-to-head

47
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:40,791
with the team Rin's
put together this year...

48
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,416
[HARUKA]
Hey. It'll be fine.

49
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,291
You don't swim a relay alone.
The four of us swim it together.

50
00:03:47,375 --> 00:03:50,291
As long as we're a team, what
have we got to worry about?

51
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:52,500
That was beautifully said.

52
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:58,000
Hey, who knows?
We could win it all!

53
00:03:58,083 --> 00:03:59,625
You really think we have a shot?

54
00:03:59,708 --> 00:04:00,875
Sure we do.

55
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,708
Like you said, "if we
put our minds to it,"

56
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,500
we could even take Nationals!

57
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:06,500
[NAGISA giggles]

58
00:04:06,583 --> 00:04:08,958
I did a little recon work
and dug up some info.

59
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,666
This is the group
Samezuka's going with:

60
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,083
Takuya Uozumi is
swimming backstroke.

61
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:15,208
And Toru Iwashimizu
is on breaststroke.

62
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,791
Why wouldn't they put
Nitori on backstroke?

63
00:04:17,875 --> 00:04:20,333
[GOU] Sosuke will be
swimming butterfly.

64
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:21,875
And, obviously,
on the final leg,

65
00:04:21,958 --> 00:04:24,250
my brother will be
swimming freestyle.

66
00:04:26,375 --> 00:04:28,708
Although, Uozumi didn't
have a very good showing

67
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:30,166
in the individual
backstroke today,

68
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:31,833
so there's a chance
he'll be replaced.

69
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,208
It's just a guess, but it
wouldn't really surprise me

70
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:36,166
if we saw an alternate
step in during the relay.

71
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,750
[MAKOTO]
Who's his alternate?

72
00:04:37,833 --> 00:04:40,125
[GOU] Uh, I can't remember his
name off the top of my head.

73
00:04:40,208 --> 00:04:41,541
It's Momo-something.

74
00:04:41,625 --> 00:04:44,416
Wait, hold on a second.
I think his name is Momo-taco.

75
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,333
[REI] Why must everything
be food with you?

76
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,958
[AMAKATA]
No, he's right. It's Momo-taco.

77
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,750
[REI]
That's ridiculous!

78

[door creaks]

Everybody's waiting for you.

Right.

What, you can't decide?

82
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:04,791
[SOSUKE] Not that it's my call,
but after the crap he pulled

83
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:08,166
out there today, Uozumi
clearly needs to be benched.

84
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,083
Yeah, yeah, I hear ya.

85
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:12,958
[RIN]
Uozumi.

86
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:13,625
Sir!

87
00:05:13,708 --> 00:05:14,291
[RIN]
Momo.

88
00:05:14,375 --> 00:05:15,750
Sir!

89
00:05:15,833 --> 00:05:17,750
I know you both have strong
feelings about the relay,

90
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,500
but unfortunately only
one of you can do it.

91
00:05:20,583 --> 00:05:22,541
After looking at the
results from today's races,

92
00:05:22,625 --> 00:05:24,416
we need to make
some tough choices.

93
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:26,666
Keep our sights on Regionals.

94
00:05:28,458 --> 00:05:32,125
Momo. You're on.

00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:39,541
Uh. Yeah?

100

I'll never forgive you
if you screw this up.

101
00:05:42,166 --> 00:05:45,291
Get out there and kick
some butt for Samezuka.

102

You got it! Watch me, dude!

103

You guys ready for this?

"debriefing." I want you all

for tomorrow. Understood?

112

[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Yes, sir!

114

You're in the way.

115
00:06:17,958 --> 00:06:20,333
[NITORI gasps]
Uh. Sorry about that.

116

[NITORI sobbing]

117
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,791
[NITORI]
Ya know...

118
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:37,708
I can't believe I actually let
an underclassman beat me.

119
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:41,166
You really wanna be in the
relay that badly, huh?

120
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,208
[NITORI]
It's only natural.

121
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,166
[SOSUKE]
What is?

122
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,833
[NITORI]
Look, I-- I just...

123
00:06:47,916 --> 00:06:51,500
From the second I laid eyes
on him, Rin's been my hero.

124
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:54,125
To tell you the truth,
when I first started swimming,

125
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,541
I couldn't have cared less
about medley relay.

126
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:58,250
It was just
another race, y'know?

127
00:06:58,333 --> 00:06:59,833
But now, I realize

128
00:06:59,916 --> 00:07:01,958
there's a lot more
to it than that.

129
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:05,125
This past year, I've had the
opportunity to witness firsthand

130
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:07,500
how much Rin truly
cares about it.

131
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:11,458
Swimming with him inspires me.
I wanna make him proud.

132
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:19,791
[NITORI] What sucks is, this was
my big chance to make it happen.

133
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:23,208
And after this summer,
I'll never get another one.

134
00:07:23,291 --> 00:07:25,375
[SOSUKE]
And who exactly decided that?

135
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:27,791
[NITORI gasps]
Huh?

136
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:30,083
[SOSUKE] If you wanna
swim with him that badly,

137
00:07:30,166 --> 00:07:33,250
then you figure out a way
to make that dream a reality.

138
00:07:35,708 --> 00:07:37,833
Don't limit yourself, kid.

139
00:07:42,791 --> 00:07:44,250
Thanks!

140
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,208
Here goes.

141
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:52,541
Huh? He's already asleep?

142
00:07:52,625 --> 00:07:55,166
Momo, it's too early
to be in bed.

143
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:58,416
All-right, let's see...

144
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:04,708
Okay look, I thought this
was my moment to shine,

145
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,208
but it turns out it's yours.

146
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,375
So go out there and win
this tournament for me!

Yep!

Make sure you rest up
tonight, alright?

Haru, you were totally amazing.

155

After today, I bet scouts from

156

all over the country'll
have their eyes on you.

00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,916
So uh, what are you gonna do

158
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,041
if one of 'em approaches you?
Given it any thought?

159
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,416
I'm not gonna "do" anything.

160
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:55,375
[MAKOTO]
Wh-What's that supposed to mean?

161
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:58,666
[HARUKA] It means I don't
care about being scouted.

162
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,666
I swim 'cause I want to.
That's it.

163
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:06,875
What's wrong?

164
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,666
[MAKOTO]
Uh-- Nothing.

165
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:10,708
Guess I'll see you
in the morning.

166
00:09:27,875 --> 00:09:29,500
[RIN] Ya know,
it's been quite a while

167
00:09:29,583 --> 00:09:32,125
since we've done a real
tournament together.

168
00:09:32,208 --> 00:09:33,416
Yeah.

169
00:09:37,375 --> 00:09:39,958
[RIN]
Let's win. Sound like a plan?

170
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:43,166
[SOSUKE]
Of course. That's why we swim.

171
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,708
Right?

172
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,500
[MOMOTARO]
Ah! Whaddup, Nitori!

173
00:09:48,583 --> 00:09:50,291
[NITORI]
Oh, hey. You forget something?

174
00:09:50,375 --> 00:09:52,458
[MOMOTARO] No, it's just--
I want you to know

175
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:56,291
I'm gonna do my best to
win today! Wish me luck!

176
00:09:58,708 --> 00:10:01,250
[ANNOUNCER 7A] Attention ladies
and gentlemen: We will now begin

177
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:04,250
the men's four-hundred-meter
medley relay race.

178
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:14,291
[RIN] Until, Haru stepped in
and kind of woke me up.

179
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:15,750
He and his buddies.

180
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,000
[SOSUKE]
Good for you.

181
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,208
I don't owe him squat.

182
00:10:21,791 --> 00:10:25,125
[RIN] No matter who wins today,
no hard feelings. Deal?

183
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,458
Just make sure you
make it to Regionals.

184
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,458
[HARUKA]
Like I need you to remind me.

185
00:10:29,541 --> 00:10:31,750
[RIN laughs]
I let you walk away

186
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,750
with the freestyle
race yesterday.

187
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,958
But today'll be a
different story.

188
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,125
I'm sure the boys
will be okay out there.

189
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:39,875
I know that they can
pull this off.

190
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:41,750
There's an old
saying that goes:

191
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:43,791
"It's not the strong who win.

192
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,875
It's the winners
who are strong."

193
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,708
[REFEREE 7A]
Ready!

194
00:10:52,708 --> 00:10:57,750
[REFEREE 7A]
On your marks, get set...

195
00:10:57,833 --> 00:10:58,916
[beep]
[CROWD] Go!

196
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:00,208
[MAKOTO gasps]

197
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,916
Oh no! He got a late start!

198
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:02,916
[AMAKATA]
It's okay!

199
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,666
I think Makoto can
make up for it!

200
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,000
[IWASHIMIZU]
Looking good, Momo!

201
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,083
[UOZUMI]
You guys, he's taking the lead!

202
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,875
Yeah. Fight! Fight!

203
00:11:09,958 --> 00:11:11,291
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
Fight! Fight!

204
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,500
[SASABE]
Makoto is catching up to him!

205
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,208
Go! Nagisa!

206
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:34,166
His usual extension
on the return leg

207
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,791
doesn't seem to be working!

208
00:11:39,791 --> 00:11:42,791
[GOU] Samezuka is maintaining
the lead after the exchange!

209
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,583
There's a chance Rei
may not be able to catch up!

210
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,291
He's trying, but Samezuka's
just too fast!

211
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,083
[NITORI] You guys,
Sosuke is widening the lead

212
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:54,791
and giving Rin some
breathing room. Amazing!

213
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:57,833
[SOUSUKE grunts]

214
00:11:59,833 --> 00:12:00,833
[RIN gasps]

215
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:13,708
Dude! Yeah!

216
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,291
Come on, Rin!

217
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:17,041
Haru!

218
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,083
Swim, Haru!

219
00:12:19,166 --> 00:12:21,000
[REI]
Guys, Rin is turning first!

220
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,208
[RIN]
Yeah!

221
00:12:46,291 --> 00:12:48,083
[SAMEZUKA CLUB]
All right, all right, Samezuka!

222
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,416
We just lost.

223
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:53,041
[SASABE] Hm. But they
made it past the prelims.

224
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,041
Which means we move on
to the regional tournament!

225
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:57,166
Good job.

226
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,750
[MOMOTARO]
Hey-hey, we got first place!

227
00:12:58,833 --> 00:12:59,458
[RIN]
Yeah!

228
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,875
Way to go! Woo!

229
00:13:01,958 --> 00:13:03,875
Kinda sucks that
my big bro isn't here

230
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:05,666
to see me totally dominate.

231
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:09,000
[RIN]
We pulled it off!

232
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,458
Nice one.

233
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:20,125
[NAGISA] They made a real
banner for us this time.

234
00:13:20,208 --> 00:13:21,625
[MAKOTO] Last year they
reused the one they had

235
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:22,958
for the judo club, remember?

236
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,500
[NAGISA]
Yeah.

237
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:27,000
So can anyone tell me why I
don't feel very happy right now?

238
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:28,458
Is that a rhetorical question?

239
00:13:28,541 --> 00:13:31,000
It's because we lost
to Samezuka, obviously!

240
00:13:31,083 --> 00:13:32,458
Oh, come on people,
you're telling me

241
00:13:32,541 --> 00:13:34,375
that doesn't chap your hide
the tiniest bit?

242
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:37,416
I'm ecstatic we
advanced and all...

243
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:40,791
But victory tastes bitter when
one must share it with a rival.

244
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,125
We were made fools of.

245
00:13:42,208 --> 00:13:44,208
We might as well've been
tarred and feathered!

246
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,083
[HARUKA]
Then how 'bout we practice?

247
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:50,000
[REI, NAGISA, MAKOTO]
Okay!

248
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,875
[GOU]
You guys, look at this!

249
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:54,291
Makoto, Rei and Nagisa
all advanced to Regionals,

250
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,041
but your times in the individual
competitions were barely

251
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,875
fast enough to make the cut.

252
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,708
See, I've got the
numbers right here!

253
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,583
All the top spots are filled
with Samezuka swimmers!

254
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,750
[MAKOTO] Well, I suppose our
times can't stand up against

255
00:14:05,833 --> 00:14:07,333
Samezuka Academy after all.

256
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:09,208
[GOU] The only one who
managed to stay at the top

257
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,666
of his category was
Haru in freestyle.

258
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,291
The long and short
of it is this:

259
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:17,166
Iwatobi is a long way from
being able to compete.

260
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,625
Here's the deal.

261
00:14:18,708 --> 00:14:20,666
We can't be satisfied with
mediocre results like this.

262
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,875
We've got to work harder than--

263
00:14:21,958 --> 00:14:24,500
[AMAKATA]
Big news, everyone! Big news!

264
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:27,333
[MAKOTO]
Miss A? What's the matter?

265
00:14:27,416 --> 00:14:29,291
I just now got a call...

266
00:14:29,375 --> 00:14:31,250
...from a talent scout
who's interested...

267
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,708
...in taking a look at Haruka!

268
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:35,125
[REI, NAGISA, MAKOTO gasp]

269
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,458
[AMAKATA]
They said they saw you

270
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:38,708
in the hundred-meter
freestyle race two days ago.

271
00:14:38,791 --> 00:14:39,833
Yeah, that's great news.

272
00:14:39,916 --> 00:14:41,500
Wow, Haru, you did it!

273
00:14:41,583 --> 00:14:43,000
Well, I suppose this
gives you an answer

274
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:45,000
about what to do
after graduation.

275
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:46,833
There's an old saying
that applies here.

276
00:14:46,916 --> 00:14:49,208
"Tomorrow will take care of
itself if you give it a chance.

277
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:51,583
And the choices you make today
will help define the future

278
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:52,916
of your tomorrows..."

279
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:54,833
[water splashes]

280
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:56,541
[MAKOTO]
Haru...

281
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,583
I wonder what Haru wants
to do after graduation?

282
00:15:04,666 --> 00:15:06,250
Well, I'm not exactly sure.

283
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:08,833
But I know he wrote "Free"
on his career-planning thing.

284
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,250
"Free"? What is that
supposed to mean?

285
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,666
He can't possibly mean
"freeter", can he?

286
00:15:13,750 --> 00:15:16,041
Mm... Probably not, no.

287
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:19,458
Uh. Hey, maybe he means
"freelance competitive swimmer?"

288
00:15:19,541 --> 00:15:21,708
Yeah, I don't think
it's that either.

289
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,458
Then what does it mean?

290
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,875
Could be anything, really.

291
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,833
Maybe at the end of
the day, in Haru's mind,

292
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,791
"free" just means "free."

293
00:15:31,875 --> 00:15:34,416
Great, now I'm really confused.

294
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,250
[REI sighs] Although, that would
be in character for the man.

295
00:15:39,333 --> 00:15:41,250
[NITORI] Congrats Rin!
This is a big deal!

296
00:15:41,333 --> 00:15:42,375
It's incredible, really.

297
00:15:42,458 --> 00:15:44,708
You got offers from
multiple scouts.

298
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:47,166
And nobody deserves it
more than you!

299
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,458
[RIN]
Thanks.

300
00:15:48,541 --> 00:15:49,916
[NITORI] Of course,
after watching that race,

301
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,750
what else did we expect?
You were absolutely amazing!

302
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,916
[RIN] If I got a bunch of
offers, that means Haru did too.

303
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,666
I can't get comfortable.
Gotta stay on top!

304
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,041
Oh, I meant to tell you.

305
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:04,916
I got an offer from the
school you decided on, too.

[SOSUKE gasps]

307
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,291
[RIN] Of course, it's not
official yet, but we might

308
00:16:09,375 --> 00:16:11,750
be able to swim on the
same team after graduation.

309

[metal clangs]

310
00:16:13,083 --> 00:16:15,500
[SOSUKE]

I think your

not being held captive
by anyone or anything.
