Yeah. Five years, right?

So, what's the story, man?

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:34,083
Hell of a time to transfer
to a new school.

00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,291
I thought that place
you were at in Tokyo

Until we swim a relay
that earns our team a rep

36
00:03:31,166 --> 00:03:32,458
for style and athleticism,

37
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,708
no one's gonna care about
four guys in a pool!

38

It'll be summer before
we can show off the goods!

39
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:39,000
Or, we can take our theme
from the membership drive

40
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,208
to the next level and prance
around school in the buff!

Why is that the first
place your mind goes?

42
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:45,833
Hey, it's either go naked
or disband the team, right?

43
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,083
Which of those options is worse?

44
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,291
They're equally bad!

Yeah, I was afraid of that.

Nanase, I assume you want to
keep swimming after high school.

There's no reason
someone with your skill

wouldn't be scouted
by a college team.

I think applies here.

"If you don't try,
you'll never know.

I transferred here from
Tokitsu High School in Tokyo.

You should all be aware that

in the top ten.

but is Tokitsu's swim team
really all that?

If you know Rin, do you know
Nanase and the others too?

00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,958
We haven't seen each other
since the sixth grade.

[SOSUKE] Well, that's not
exactly true.

I've competed with him before.

102

I learned a lot about my own
limits as a swimmer that day.

If you're not careful,

where you left off

like no time had passed.

Look at him go!

110
00:06:08,083 --> 00:06:09,541
He can get his torso higher
above the water's surface

111
00:06:09,625 --> 00:06:11,458
than most swimmers--
decreases the resistance

112
00:06:11,541 --> 00:06:13,208
he'd have to deal
with otherwise.

113
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:15,125
And his shoulder
flexibility isn't something

114
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:18,500
that happens overnight.
The guy's a beast.

115
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:20,000
He's worked hard to get there.

116
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,500
So, that must mean Sosuke
is the world-class swimmer

117
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:25,833
Mikoshiba was telling us about!

118
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:27,458
[AMAKATA] The best part
about being inside

119
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,916
is that you don't have to worry
about getting sunburned.

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,958
You wouldn't be working on
your tan right now anyway,

121
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,041
and we can only use this place
'til the weather turns.

122
00:06:34,125 --> 00:06:35,291
It's great, though.

123
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:36,833
Getting a head start on
our practice like this

124
00:06:36,916 --> 00:06:38,916
means we can take
the regionals by storm!

125
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,125
And after we win nationals,
we'll be so famous

everyone will be falling
all over themselves to join!

You know what?
I think Haru and Makoto

128
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:47,625

00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,625
It's gotta be epic!

159
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,625
Hey. I'm sure we could
come up with something!

160
00:07:47,708 --> 00:07:50,375
Miss Amakata, I feel bad
for asking, but, uh...

161
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,041
Would you mind
helping us out a little?

162
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:53,666
If you can spare
the time, of course.

163
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:54,708
Ahh! Or not!

164
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:56,583
I'm just a tad busy
at the moment.

165
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,291
Cool! We'll make do!

166
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,208
[GOU, NAGISA]
That's all of 'em!

167
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:07,791
[NAGISA] We still need
to come up with something

168
00:08:07,875 --> 00:08:08,875
for the main event.

169
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,000
[GOU]
What about a dog-paddle race?

170
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:10,916
[NAGISA]
Could be fun.

171
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,458
[REI]
I'll go you one better:

172
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,500
how about a competition to see
who does the best butterfly?

173
00:08:14,583 --> 00:08:17,500
We can call it
"Butterfly of Beauty!"

174
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:19,750
[GOU] A muscle contest
would be pretty cool.

175
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:21,166
Oh, come on!

176
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,250
Is there nothing you can't
work your obsession into?

177
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,666
[MAKOTO laughs]

178
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:24,833
You're pretty quiet.

179
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:27,250
Any ideas floatin'
around in there?

180
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:30,375
We could do a relay.

181
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,083
[GROUP]
Huh?

182
00:08:32,166 --> 00:08:33,583
That's a fantastic idea!

183
00:08:33,666 --> 00:08:35,083
People would lose
their minds!

184
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:37,083
I believe we have
ourselves a winner!

185
00:08:37,166 --> 00:08:38,291
[GOU]
It'll give everyone a taste

186
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:39,958
of how we'll kill
it at regionals!

187
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:41,208
[MAKOTO]
True.

188
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:43,000
We'd need to find a team
to race against, though.

189
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:44,833
And why are you callin' it that?

190
00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:46,250
[REI]
We're holding it at Iwatobi SC--

191
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:48,416
[NAGISA]
--Returns!

192
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,250
[RIN] Well, at least
that one makes sense.

193
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,916
[MAKOTO]
Uh, hey, Rin?

194
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,250
[RIN]
Is that you Makoto?

195
00:08:53,333 --> 00:08:56,291
[MAKOTO]
Yeah. Hello.

196
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:57,625
So the main event's a big relay

197
00:08:57,708 --> 00:08:59,500
and you want us to
swim against you?

198
00:08:59,583 --> 00:09:00,791
[MAKOTO]
You cool with that?

199
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:01,666
Dude, I don't know.

200
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,666
Pretty please?

201
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:07,708
[RIN] I'll say this for them,
they're a carefree bunch.

202
00:09:07,791 --> 00:09:09,333
Drives me nuts.

203
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:12,416
Yeah, you complain, but we
both know you're gonna do it.

204
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:13,500
[RIN]
Uh--

205
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,125
[SOSUKE]
Who you taking with you?

206
00:09:17,208 --> 00:09:18,750
[RIN] It's not like
an official match,

207
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:21,416
finding people will be a pain.

208
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,708
[SOSUKE]
Count me in.

209
00:09:23,791 --> 00:09:26,375
Wait. Seriously?

210
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,000
Sure. Why not?

211
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,166
I'll do freestyle.

212
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,500
That's fine by me.

213
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:35,916
You sure you don't wanna
go with butterfly, though?

214
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,208
Heh. I feel like expanding
my area of expertise.

215
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:45,541
[NITORI]
Absolutely I'll swim!

216
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:48,458
It's a good opportunity to get
geared up for the real thing.

217
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:51,375
Nakagawa agrees.
He said he'd join us.

218
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,125
Awesome. Thank you.

219
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,083
Nakagawa's happy
to swim backstroke,

220
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,458
I'll take breaststroke.

221
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,083
[RIN] Whatever you're
comfortable with, I suppose.

222
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,375
You sure?

223
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:02,958
I am.

224
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,875
See, my ultimate goal is to have
two specialties under my belt,

225
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:05,958
just like you.

226
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:07,666
I've been training
super hard, so...

227
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:09,208
[RIN gasps]

228
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:11,416
I'll, uh, hopefully get to a
level here soon where you guys

229
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:14,291
will be proud to have me
as part of the team, y'know?

230
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,208
[RIN]
Part of the team.

231
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:24,333
Not like I can give Haru
and the others attitude.

232
00:10:24,416 --> 00:10:26,333
They've got a relay team.

233
00:10:26,416 --> 00:10:28,000
I don't.

234
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:37,375
[HARUKA] I feel like running
up the coast today.

235
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:38,791
[MAKOTO]
Cool.

236
00:10:38,875 --> 00:10:40,375
It's a good way to beef up
our stamina for regionals.

237
00:10:40,458 --> 00:10:42,000
[HARUKA]
Right.

238
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,958
[MAKOTO]
Hey, so, uh...

239
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:49,375
[HARUKA]
Yeah?

240
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:51,041
[MAKOTO] What'cha got waitin'
for you after all this?

241
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,083
[HARUKA]
What do you mean?

242
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,708
[MAKOTO]
Y'know, what Rin was saying.

243
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:57,083
What're you gonna do once
high school's just a memory?

244
00:10:57,166 --> 00:11:00,666
[HARUKA] Doesn't matter to me,
as long as I can swim.

245
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,916
[MAKOTO chuckles]

246
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,666
[MAKOTO]
Figures.

247
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,166
[GIRL 2A]
Hey, we're over here!

248
00:11:10,250 --> 00:11:11,625
[GOU]
Awesome! You'll love it!

249
00:11:11,708 --> 00:11:13,958
[RIN]
Come on.

250
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,166
[NITORI] Bad news, sir--
er, I mean, Rin!

251
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,666
[RIN]
What's up?

252
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:20,916
Nakagawa. He-He got detention
for goofing off in class,

253
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,041
so he can't make it!

254
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,041
Argh! You're kidding me, right?

255
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,791
[NITORI] I wish I was,
but he's stuck there

256
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,708
'til he finishes
retaking his test.

257
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,541
He was acting up
'cause he bombed it.

258
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:33,000
And of course this
had to happen today.

259
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:35,416
We can't do a relay with
just the three of us.

260
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,750
I know, it's terrible!

261
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:38,291
We don't have time
to find anyone else!

262
00:11:38,375 --> 00:11:39,916
The race is in half an hour!

263
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,708
[RAN laughs]

264
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,958
Piggyback!

265
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:46,166
[MAKOTO] Ack! Get off me,
you're too heavy.

266
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,625
[REN]
Wait up, I'm coming!

267
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,291
Oh! My bathing suit! Hang on!

268
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,791
One day, we might actually
be on time for something.

269
00:11:52,875 --> 00:11:54,208
[REN]
Haru!

270
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:55,750
Sorry to keep you waiting.

271
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:57,125
The rugrats are coming, too?

272
00:11:57,208 --> 00:11:59,375
They're sorta keyed up
about the kickboard race.

273
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,250
Will we be racing
against you guys?

274
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,291
[HARUKA] Huh. Only if
you're swimming freestyle.

275
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:05,333
I can do freestyle
on a kickboard!

276
00:12:05,416 --> 00:12:07,416
So can I! Race with me!

277
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,666
[RIN]
We're screwed.

278
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,916
Who else do we know that
can swim the backstroke?

279
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,500
[NITORI]
I don't know.

280
00:12:12,583 --> 00:12:15,333
There's no practice today, so
everybody's already gone home.

281
00:12:15,416 --> 00:12:16,416
[RIN sighs]

282
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,666
[SOSUKE]
I'll just go twice.

283
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,958
It's not like it's an
official event or anything.

284
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,666
There's some leeway to fudge
the usual competition rules.

285
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:26,125
Look, it may not be the real
deal, but it's still a race.

286
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,208
There's no point in doing it

287
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,666
if we're not gonna
take it seriously.

288
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,833
[STUDENT 2D]
Yo! Mikoshiba!

289
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:32,208
[RIN, NITORI]
Did that guy say?

290
00:12:32,291 --> 00:12:34,333
[MOMOTARO] Coming! Don't get
your panties in a wad!

291
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:35,416
[STUDENT 2D]
Come on!

292
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,041
[MOMOTARO]
Heh! You see me, don't ya?

293
00:12:38,125 --> 00:12:39,416
[RIN]
I'm gonna go out on a limb

294
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,000
and say that's
not a common name.

295
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,625
Only one person I know has it.

296
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:45,416
[NITORI] Yeah. I was just
thinking the same thing.

297
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,791
[RIN]
Hold on there, champ!

298
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:49,250
[MOMOTARO]
Huh?

299
00:12:49,333 --> 00:12:50,666
What is your problem?!

300
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:52,416
Listen, I know this is comin'
from out of the blue,

301
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,458
but your Seijuro's
little bro, right?

302
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:56,125
[MOMOTARO]
Yeah, so?

303
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:58,333
Why the heck is that
any business of yours?

304
00:12:58,416 --> 00:13:00,416
[RIN]
Bingo! This is our guy!

305
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:01,583
[NITORI]
We're saved!

306
00:13:01,666 --> 00:13:04,000
So, uh. You, swim
the backstroke like him?

307
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,916
Um. Well, yeah.
That's sorta my area.

308
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,750
Matter of fact, back home I won
tons of competitions and stuff.

309
00:13:09,833 --> 00:13:12,500
Swimming the backstroke made
me kinda like a celebrity!

310
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,958
No lie. I had an awesome
nickname and everything.

311
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,333
[MOMOTARO]
They called me...

312
00:13:18,416 --> 00:13:20,916
...The Otter.

313
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,666
[RIN]
Okay then.

314
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:24,916
Uh, I'm starting to think
the world-class athlete

315
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,291
Mikoshiba was talking about
was actually his brother.

316
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:30,291
Yeah. Guess he wanted to pave
the way for him or whatever.

317
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:31,791
It's what a big brother does.

318
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,458
I don't know what kinda crap
Seijuro's been tellin' you .

319
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,416
But if this is about me
joining the swim team,

320
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,458
I'm not interested.

321
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:38,875
[STUDENT 2D]
Are you coming or not?

322
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,250
Keep your shirt on!

323
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:44,458
Later, guys! Daddy's got
to get his freak on!

324
00:13:44,541 --> 00:13:46,041
Oh come on, man!

325
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:48,208
I told you straight up I'm not
joining the team, so lay off!

326
00:13:48,291 --> 00:13:49,625
You think the ladies
care whether or not

327
00:13:49,708 --> 00:13:51,041
I do the backstroke?

328
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,833
Look, man, nobody's asking
you to join the swim team.

329
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:56,041
But if you wanna get
the ladies' attention,

330
00:13:56,125 --> 00:13:58,916
we might be able
to help you there.

331
00:13:59,000 --> 00:13:59,916
[NAGISA]
There they are.

332
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,541
Hey, guys! Over here!

333
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,333
Good morning everybody.

334
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,708
[HARUKA, MAKOTO]
Good morning, Rei.

335
00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,875
[REN] It's the butterfly man!
Show us your wings!

336
00:14:06,958 --> 00:14:08,875
[RAN] He's a butterfly
with glasses!

337
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,500
Looks like someone's popular.

338
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:11,916
Don't encourage them.

339
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,041
[GOU] Here's the program.
Pretty slick, huh?

340
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,375
[MAKOTO]
Nice.

341
00:14:15,458 --> 00:14:16,875
[AMAKATA] The schedule's
packed from top to bottom.

342
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:18,208
[NAGISA]
Wow! Awesome!

343
00:14:18,291 --> 00:14:19,458
[MOMOTARO] ...filthy liar
and I hate your face!

344
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:20,791
You made it sound like
we were going somewhere

345
00:14:20,875 --> 00:14:22,333
I could practice my moves
on wall-to-wall hotti--!

346
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:24,625
Hey! Shut up! There are
kids in here, idiot!

347
00:14:24,708 --> 00:14:26,333
Easy on the PG13 stuff!

348
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:30,083
Somebody help!
I've been tricked!

349
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,833
Where did Sosuke run off to?

350
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:33,833
Huh. He was just here. No clue.

351
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,708
Ugh. Has everybody gone nuts?

352
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:36,958
Let go!

353
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,875
[RIN]
Stop squirming.

354
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:38,625
I wanna go home!

355
00:14:38,708 --> 00:14:40,708
[GOU]
You are so late.

356
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,958
[GOU laughs]

357
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,333
Hey big brother!

358
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:47,625
Hey, Gou. 'sup?

359
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:48,500
[GOU]
You excited?

360
00:14:48,583 --> 00:14:49,125
Yeah.

361
00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:50,625
Hold on a second.

362
00:14:50,708 --> 00:14:54,916
I think-- I think
I might be in love.

363
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
[RIN]
Oh, no.

364
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,416
[NITORI]
Just like his brother.

365
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,833
Rin, we really appreciate
you guys being here.

366
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:00,916
[RIN]
Sure.

367
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,041
[NITORI]
Thanks for asking us to come.

368
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,083
I've been looking forward to it.

369
00:15:03,166 --> 00:15:05,333
Yeah? Cool! It should be fun.

370
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,166
[GOU]
Here, take a few programs.

371
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,791
[NITORI]
Thanks. These look great!

372
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:22,583
Oh, Sosuke!

373
00:15:22,666 --> 00:15:24,583
Whoa! Feels like I haven't
seen you in forever.

374
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:27,125
Right? I can't even
remember the last time.

375
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:28,791
I guess transferring
to a new school

376
00:15:28,875 --> 00:15:30,166
means you get to
treat the old crew

377
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:32,041
like they fell off
the face of the earth.

378
00:15:32,125 --> 00:15:34,208
Not that Rin bothered to
stay in touch with anyone.

379
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,500
Well, you know.

380
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:36,458
[GOU]
Yes, I do.

381
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:37,458
Should we know him?

382
00:15:37,541 --> 00:15:39,041
Sosuke's an old
friend of Rini's.

383
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:42,291
They used to be teammates on
the Sano Elementary Swim Club.

384
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,166
He was actually in
the lane next to ours

385
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:46,833
when we all swam that relay
together back in the day.

386
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,583
Talk about a blast
from the past.

387
00:15:48,666 --> 00:15:49,875
See you guys in the water?

388
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:50,750
Of course.

389
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:51,208
Yep!

390
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,916
Let's go.

391
00:15:53,916 --> 00:15:55,250
Momotaro Mikoshiba!

392
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,958
I love nature!
I collect stag beetles!

393
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,291
My mantra is
"just keep swimming."

394
00:15:58,375 --> 00:15:59,500
I can cook an egg
five different ways--

395
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:00,750
not poached,
that's a pain in butt--

396
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:02,083
and the first place
I wash when I--!

397
00:16:02,166 --> 00:16:03,958
[RIN] Shut your trap,
move your feet.

398
00:16:04,041 --> 00:16:06,750
[MOMOTARO]
Ow! I'm trying to have a life!

399
00:16:13,333 --> 00:16:15,208
[NAGISA]
This is gonna be amazing.

400
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,583
[REI]
Let's hope so.

401
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,208
Squid swimming in full regalia
is fairly ambitious.

402
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,500
I'm fascinated to see
if they'll pull it off.

403
00:16:24,791 --> 00:16:26,750
All right. So that's it?

404
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,125
Mm. Yeah.

405
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,833
I mean, I guess so,
I've never seen it done before.

406
00:16:29,916 --> 00:16:32,916
Oh. Oh, this is glorious!

407
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,000
[MAKOTO]
Really?

408
00:16:34,083 --> 00:16:36,000
[NAGISA]
Okay, what's next?

409
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,625
Muscle contest?

410
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:39,375
So, Gou got her way.

411
00:16:39,458 --> 00:16:40,666
You know how she is,

412
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,166
she wasn't going to
let the issue slide.

413
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,916
Well, she's gonna miss
it if she doesn't hurry.

414
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,916
She's not going
to miss anything.

415
00:16:48,083 --> 00:16:50,250
[MAKOTO]
Wait, she's a judge?

416
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,041
Something I can help you with,
or you just gonna stand there?

417
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,541
Hey. Long time, Nanase.

418
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,041
So I saw what happened in the
relay at regionals last year.

419
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,375
[HARUKA]
I didn't know you were there.

420
00:17:05,458 --> 00:17:07,416
Had nothing better to do.
I gotta tell you,

421
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,375
what you and your boys
pulled out there was insane.

422
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,041
Can't believe Rin played along.

423
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:12,083
[SOSUKE laughs]

424
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:13,916
Going somewhere
with this, or what?

425
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:24,791
I'd have never made him
do something so crazy.

426
00:17:26,416 --> 00:17:28,500
What are you sayin', man?

427
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:36,416
If you know what's good for you,
you'll stay out of Rin's way.

428
00:17:48,666 --> 00:17:50,125
[AMAKATA]
Alright, ladies and gentlemen!

429
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,458
We come now to the main event:
a 200-meter medley relay!

430
00:17:53,541 --> 00:17:55,500
Let's hear it for Team Dolphin
and Team Shark!

431
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:58,458
[MOMOTARO]
Gou! Look over here! Hey!

432
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:00,833
I think the dude yelling at Gou
is Mikoshiba's little brother,

433
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,541
they say his backstroke's
crazy tight.

434
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,625
Huh. Small world.

435
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,541
[NAGISA]
Oh, and apparently

436
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,208
Rin's going with
butterfly today.

437
00:18:06,291 --> 00:18:07,875
[REI]
That's certainly a one-eighty!

438
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:09,208
[NAGISA]
No kidding, right?

439
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,083
That's why Yamazaki's
gonna be doin' freestyle.

440
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,750
[SASABE]
Get set...

441
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:19,375
[whistle blows]
[CROWD cheers]

442
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,375
Nice one! There you go!

443
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,000
That's how you start a race!

444
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:25,458
Wasn't sure he had it in him.

445
00:18:25,541 --> 00:18:27,625
Kid pulls a nearly
perfect backstroke.

446
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:29,875
[REI] He's got nothing on
Makoto for speed, though.

447
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,083
That's his Achilles' Heel.
And here he comes.

448
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,458
[CROWD cheers]

449
00:18:34,541 --> 00:18:36,750
You swimming breaststroke
today, Aye-Aye?

450
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,541
Bold choice.

451
00:18:38,625 --> 00:18:41,208
Please.
You don't scare me.

452
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,041
Look at us.

453
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,250
That's why all those hours
of training pay off.

454
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,500
I guess.

455
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:51,541
[REI] They're about to
get their butts kicked.

456
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:53,666
[MAKOTO] Nagisa's always faster
in the second round.

457
00:18:53,750 --> 00:18:57,083
That's when we'll close the gap.

458
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:58,708
Hate to break it
to you, my friend,

459
00:18:58,791 --> 00:19:00,291
but I believe we've got
this one wrapped up.

460
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:03,500
Heh. Dive in first if you
want to, doesn't bother me.

461
00:19:03,583 --> 00:19:06,375
Watch your back once
you get going, though.

462
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,666
Heh. If you're not careful,

463
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,416
the water will sink
its teeth into you.

464
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,541
Wha--?

465
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,708
I suggest you worry
about yourself.

466
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,708
Rei against Rin;
talk about an epic race!

467
00:19:19,791 --> 00:19:21,500
[MAKOTO] Little by little,
Rin's gaining on 'im.

468
00:19:21,583 --> 00:19:23,250
Man, he's fast!

469
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,375
[NITORI] Rin's catching up!
He's gonna overtake him!

470
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,416
All he needed was
a second, and boom!

471
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,875
Guy's some kinda super hero!

472
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,625
Why do you think your
brother made a big deal

473
00:19:39,708 --> 00:19:42,750
about handing the reins over
to him once he'd graduated?

474
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:45,083
It's gonna be close!

475
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:48,625
[SASABE]
Atta boy, Rei!

476
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,250
[CROWD cheers]

477
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,708
[REI] There's barely
any gap between them!

478
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:13,000
He's keeping pace with
Haru like an absolute boss!

479
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:18,875
[CROWD cheers]

480
00:20:18,958 --> 00:20:20,000
Yeah! Lookin' good!

481
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:20,833
Go!

482
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,166
--Come on!
--You got this!

483
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,208
Haruka!

484
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:31,791
[CROWD cheers]

485
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:37,583
[SOSUKE, HARUKA pant]

486
00:20:37,666 --> 00:20:38,583
[MAKOTO]
Nice.

487
00:20:38,666 --> 00:20:40,500
Like anyone else
was gonna win!

488
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:42,833
As if there was ever a moment
of doubt in our hearts!

489
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:44,125
We keep this momentum
up for District,

490
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,750
we're gonna have ourselves
a heck of a year!

491
00:20:45,833 --> 00:20:46,750
Yeah!

492
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:47,791
[GROUP laughs]

493
00:20:47,875 --> 00:20:49,000
[RIN]
Heads up.

494
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:51,750
[RIN]
Good race.

495
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:53,375
Thanks for comin'
to this thing, man,

496
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:54,750
wouldn't have wanted
to do it without ya.

497
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:56,125
Sure.

498
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,708
I'm sorry!

499
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:01,250
I guess my heart just
wasn't in the race.

500
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,458
For your first relay you
actually did pretty good,

501
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:04,791
don't beat yourself up.

502
00:21:04,875 --> 00:21:09,208
[MOMOTARO] Aaahhh!
Next time we'll make 'em pay!

503
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,375
Hey.

504
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,750
Ow.

505
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,750
If by "next time," you mean
you wanna join the team.

506
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:20,041
We could use a guy with
your backstroke skills.

507
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,875
Just something to think about.

508
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,750
[RIN, MOMOTARO laugh]

509
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:28,333
[applause]

510
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,250
[NAGISA] People really
seemed to get into it, huh?

511
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,500
Well, it's certainly a relief
to be over with for me.

512
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,083
[MAKOTO, NAGISA laugh]

513
00:21:34,166 --> 00:21:35,625
So, what do ya say we scrounge
up some grub on the way home?

514
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:36,791
[NITORI]
That's sounds amazing.

515
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:37,666
[MOMOTARO]
Wait. You payin'?

516
00:21:37,750 --> 00:21:38,875
[RIN]
What? No.

517
00:21:38,958 --> 00:21:40,375
[NITORI] That might
actually be a problem,

518
00:21:40,458 --> 00:21:42,041
I don't have any money on me.

519
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:43,416
[RIN]
Fine.

520
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,833
[NAGISA] Hey, did we ever find
out who won the muscle contest?

521
00:23:21,916 --> 00:23:22,416
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

522
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,708
[NAGISA]
Really?

523
00:23:23,791 --> 00:23:24,791
[MAKOTO] I wasn't gonna enter,
I got roped in.

524
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,125
[NAGISA]
Let me guess: Gou?

525
00:23:26,208 --> 00:23:28,125
[MAKOTO] Yeah, but her
highest score went to Rin.

526
00:23:28,208 --> 00:23:29,583
I got the highest overall.

527
00:23:29,666 --> 00:23:31,166
[NAGISA]
'Cause you got 'dem traps, bro!

528
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,625
That's where it's at!

529
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,041
[HARUKA] Anyone else notice
Rei getting lost in space?

530
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,833
[MAKOTO] The squid-style thing
got his wheels turnin'.

531
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:37,791
[HARUKA] Next time:
"Butterfly of Farewell."

532
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,833
[NAGISA]
Hello. Earth to Rei...
