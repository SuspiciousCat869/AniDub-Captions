Swim the backstroke like a boss,

--[MOMOTARO] The biggest one
--Uh-huh... Okay...

160
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:49,750
I've got so far is the size
of your head, no lie!

161
00:06:49,833 --> 00:06:51,208
And I loves me some spaghetti--

162
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,416
Dude, chill.

--[GOU] Oh. Hey, Rin.

164
00:06:56,291 --> 00:06:58,416
[GOU] I'm guessing you're here
to pick up some swimsuits?

165
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,375
[RIN]
Yeah. What're you up to, sis?

166
00:07:00,458 --> 00:07:01,708
Where's everybody else?

167
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:03,166
[GOU]
It's just me.

168

Hey, candy apple! Tell me
these aren't awesome-sauce!

169
00:07:04,833 --> 00:07:05,916
What?

170
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:06,875
Which do you think
I'd look more swoll in,

171
00:07:06,958 --> 00:07:07,958
orange or blue? Eh?

172
00:07:08,041 --> 00:07:09,166
Mikoshiba--

173
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,708
Aw c'mon, sweet cheeks,
don't be so formal!

174

Call me Momo!

Alrighty...

Momo!

00:07:13,875 --> 00:07:15,166
Sorry!

[NITORI]
So...

179
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,458
What do you think
about this one?

180
00:07:17,541 --> 00:07:18,583
Sweet, right?

[MOMOTARO coughs]
I think you might've

184
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:26,625
crushed my windpipe a little.

185
00:07:26,708 --> 00:07:28,250
Look at this.

186
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:30,166
[RIN] I'm thinkin' this
is the way we wanna go,

187
00:07:30,250 --> 00:07:31,791
to match your swim style.

188
00:07:31,875 --> 00:07:32,958
[MOMOTARO]
Hm...

189
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:34,000
But it's so tiny.

190
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:34,916
[RIN]
That's the idea.

191
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,583
We want trim and lightweight.

192
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,250
[GOU giggles]

193
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:38,500
What's so funny?

194
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:39,833
Nothing, nothing at all.

195
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,833
Listen, I've gotta
get back to shopping.

[SOSUKE]
See ya.

197
00:07:43,166 --> 00:07:44,125
[MOMOTARO] Can't we go
with something flashier?

198
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,666
I mean, if we're
talking my style.

199
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,916
Flashy isn't the point.
You'll be underwater.

200
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,291
You never said whether
you liked the green.

201
00:07:52,333 --> 00:07:54,291
You know that stuff's
loaded with sugar?

202
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:56,166
You have the diet
of a fifth grader.

Eh, what the heck.

Hmph. Wanna RPS me for it?

Best two out of three!
Winner takes all!

209

Hadn't had one
of these in forever.

210
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:14,375
[SOSUKE] Makes me think back
to that one time, remember?

211
00:08:14,458 --> 00:08:15,875
[RIN]
Huh?

212
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,125
The loser had to promise to do
whatever the winner said?

213

[YOUNG SOSUKE]
No whining, either.

214

You lose, I choose. Got it?

You hafta' promise,
no take backs.

216

Yeah, I got it.
Let's do this already.

217
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,541
[YOUNG RIN] We go when the
second gets to the top, okay?

218
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,791
Ready--

219
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,375
[YOUNG RIN]
Ah! Ahh!

220
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,416
I so had you 'til
that stupid turn!

221

Yeah. Whatever, dude.

00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,291
Ugh. Fine. I lose, you chose.

223

Just don't make me do
anything embarrassing.

224
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:50,291
That's all I ask.

225
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:53,208
Uh-- Hey, there's no
need to cry about it.

226
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,458
I'm not crying! Tell me
what you want me to do!

227
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,208
All right, then. Fine.

228
00:08:58,333 --> 00:08:59,375
Sorry, man.

229
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,166
I need time to think
of something good.

230
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,250
Wow, y'know, I'd
completely forgotten about

231
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,625
that whole thing.

232
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:06,458
Yeah, I never did quite
figure out what I wanted you

233
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:09,583
to do, but before I knew it,
you were leaving for Australia.

234
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,500
[YOUNG RIN] I still owe you
for the butterfly race.

235
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:12,666
Don't worry about it.

236
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,500
We're cool, I couldn't
think of anything.

237
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,750
You're killin' me.

238
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:17,791
If it means that much,
I'll make something up

239
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,916
for the next time I see you.

240
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,083
'Til then, huh?

241
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,333
Yeah.

I'm still waitin'.

243
00:09:26,416 --> 00:09:28,666
You've had more
than enough time.

244
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,125
I mean, here we are, is there
somethin' you want me to do?

245
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:32,958
[SOSUKE]
Maybe.

246
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,291
Well how 'bout lettin' me
sleep on the bottom bunk?

247
00:09:35,375 --> 00:09:37,458
That doesn't count, we competed
for that the other day

248
00:09:37,541 --> 00:09:38,958
and I won. C'mon, dude.

249
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:41,333
Don't go wastin' my promise
on something stupid.

250
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,166
Fine. Give me the rest
of your soda, then.

251
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,541
Will you knock it off
and take this seriously?

252
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:49,041
[SOSUKE laughs]
Relax.

253
00:09:49,125 --> 00:09:51,833
I need to sit on it for a
little longer, that's all.

254
00:09:51,916 --> 00:09:54,000
[RIN sighs]

255
00:09:54,083 --> 00:09:56,875
[SOSUKE]
Let me ask you something.

256
00:09:56,958 --> 00:10:00,000
How come I never heard
from you in all that time?

257
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:02,625
What happened over there?

258
00:10:02,708 --> 00:10:05,666
You didn't call.
You stopped writing.

259
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,916
It was like you fell off
the face of the Earth.

260
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,000
For all I knew, you had.
I didn't push back then

261
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:14,208
'cause I didn't want to get
all up in your face about it.

262
00:10:14,291 --> 00:10:19,000
But, I mean, now...

263
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,208
I feel like I need to know.

264
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:27,500
[RIN]
It wasn't anything major.

265
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:29,916
I hit a wall with the swimming.

266
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,166
Life can be rough when
you're the new kid.

267
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:35,208
I fell down,
couldn't get on my feet.

268
00:10:35,291 --> 00:10:36,625
Happens.

269
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:39,625
I thought about saying goodbye
to swimming altogether.

270
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:41,250
Until...

271
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,791
Haru stepped in and
kinda woke me up.

272
00:10:43,875 --> 00:10:45,583
He and his buddies.

273
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,583
You really like those guys, huh?

274
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,083
Well, yeah!

275
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:51,750
It's 'cause of them I fell
in love with the water again.

276
00:10:51,833 --> 00:10:53,541
They made me see
in a whole new light.

277
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:57,458
It's like, with them I
recaptured that spark, y'know?

278
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,666
I don't swim for myself anymore.

279
00:10:59,750 --> 00:11:01,250
Not really.

280
00:11:01,333 --> 00:11:04,666
The people who've inspired me
have become part of my dream.

281
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,958
Heh. There's my Rin.

282
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,000
If the world ever needs
a poolside Socrates,

283
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,916
you could dive right in.

284
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,083
--[RIN] Screw you.
--[SOSUKE laughs]

285
00:11:15,458 --> 00:11:16,791
[NAGISA]
Wow.

286
00:11:16,875 --> 00:11:18,958
You made all of this
yourself, just for us?

287
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,083
It looks delicious.

288
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:21,208
Glad you think so!

289
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:22,583
Told you it wouldn't
be that bad.

290
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,416
Were these babies totally
worth the trip downtown

291
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,875
to look for
ingredients, or what?

292
00:11:25,958 --> 00:11:29,000
I even got to see my brother
and Sosuke in the bargain.

293
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:30,916
Wait. You saw Rin and Yamazaki?

294
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,875
Yeah, I did. Pure coincidence.

295
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:35,250
A few guys from the Samezuka
team were in the mall.

296
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,041
Huh. I suppose
they're gettin' ready.

297
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:37,916
[NAGISA]
Bon appetit!

298
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
One for each of you.

299
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:41,458
Thank you for the goodies, Gou!

300
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:43,666
[NAGISA]
Aw, I'm in heaven!

301
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,541
Not to be that guy, but, uh...

302
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,750
Before I bite into this,
I'm just curious...

303
00:11:47,833 --> 00:11:50,083
You ran into your brother
shopping for swim gear

304
00:11:50,166 --> 00:11:52,083
at the same place you bought
whatever went into these?

305
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:52,958
Well...

306
00:11:53,041 --> 00:11:54,708
I didn't buy everything there.

307
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:57,041
Only the protein.
We're going for balance.

308
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,416
I needed something extra.

309
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,791
Holy crap, my rice ball's
full of chocolate!

310

[HARUKA, MAKOTO gag]

311
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:07,208
[MAKOTO] I knew I smelled
a rat when you mentioned

312
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:11,416
being at the mall instead of an
actual grocery store. So gross.

313
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,958

[REI] Question: that Yamazaki
fellow you were talking about.

That's Rin's old
friend from back

why wouldn't Rin swim a relay

with him when he had the chance?

326
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,708
[GOU] That's just it,
they did swim a relay together

327
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,791
at a district tournament
several years ago.

328
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:42,041
For some reason, it didn't
work out all that well.

329
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:44,375
They haven't swum
together since.

You take turns pulling the

00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:50,500
you tend to get close.
I mean, think about it.

333

Why suddenly haul off
and leave them?

I thought it had something

337
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,458
to do with Rin's take on
relay racing, so I figured,

338
00:12:58,541 --> 00:13:00,083
why not ask him myself?

00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,458
[YOUNG RIN] Badmouth my
dad again, I'll punch you.

468
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:54,458
[YOUNG SOSUKE] I didn't mean it
the way it sounded. I'm sorry.

469
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,625
[YOUNG RIN] What was up
with your swimming today?

470
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,500
I'm talkin' to you, man.

471
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,291
[YOUNG SOSUKE] I don't think
swimming is a team sport.

472
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,166
I mean, once you're in the
water, you're on your own.

473
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,625
It's not like anyone
can help you be faster.

474
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,000
[YOUNG RIN grunts]
That's not true and you know it!

475
00:18:11,083 --> 00:18:12,833
When you swim relay,
you swim as a team!

476
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,750
You're a link in a chain!

477
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:17,000
Look, I think it all
comes down to this.

478
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,833
Our goals are too
different for you and me

479
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:19,791
to be on the same team.

480
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,125
[YOUNG RIN gasps]

481
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,916
[YOUNG SOSUKE] I don't wanna
be on relay anymore, period.

482
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,875
If I have to worry about the
other guy all the time,

483
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,291
it's gonna kill what I
get out of swimming.

484
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:33,416
What can I tell you?

485
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,000
Back then, yeah,
that's what I thought.

486
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,375
I was just a dumb kid.

487
00:18:36,458 --> 00:18:39,458
Thing is, now I'm not so sure.

488
00:18:39,541 --> 00:18:42,708
I need to figure this out.
Maybe relay is how.

489
00:18:42,791 --> 00:18:44,458
Sometimes you don't know
what you're looking for

490
00:18:44,541 --> 00:18:45,750
'til you've got it.

491
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:47,833
'times you just swim
too far ahead.

492
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:48,916
Come on.

493
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,666
You want me to
spell it out for you?

494
00:18:50,750 --> 00:18:52,708
Look, you made a promise
to do whatever I said,

495
00:18:52,791 --> 00:18:54,666
don't even think
of backing out now!

496
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,458
'Cause...

497
00:18:56,541 --> 00:18:58,250
[RIN gasps]

498
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:03,208
I can't promise
you'll find yourself.

499
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,583
That's not how it works.
There is no guarantee.

500
00:19:05,666 --> 00:19:08,666
I'm afraid you are
on your own there.

501
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:10,708
Heh. Yeah, I know.

502
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:12,500
[RIN]
But...

503
00:19:12,583 --> 00:19:14,166
I'll do what I can
to steer a friend

504
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,125
in the right direction.

505
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,666
I hold the Samezuka
team record

506
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:19,625
for both freestyle
and butterfly.

507
00:19:19,708 --> 00:19:21,833
So, if you think swimming
relay will be some kind of

508
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:24,083
spiritual awakening,
you'll have to earn it.

509
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:25,500
If I'm hearing you right,
you're saying

510
00:19:25,583 --> 00:19:27,458
you'll accept me on the
relay team if I can beat you

511
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:32,125
in a race. Let's do it,
then. Like old times.

512
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,333
Yeah, well don't
get too cocky, pal.

513
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,833
Things change.

514
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,875
[RIN]
We're doin' butterfly.

515
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,750
100 meters.

516
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:51,500
[RIN]
Ready...

517
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:04,583
[RIN]
Power.

518
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:07,625
Confidence. This is
how it should be.

519
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:09,791
This is the real him.

520
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,166
Yeah!

521
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,583
[RIN] See, that's what
I'm talkin' about

522
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:31,125
when I say passion.

523
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:35,000
The perfect combination
of skill and desire.

524
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:38,875
Any doubts I had before,
are pretty much gone.

525
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,708
Nice goin', Sosuke.

526
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:44,541
[RIN]
All right. Listen up.

527
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,000
It's time for all of us to
start thinking about District.

528
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,791
And just so you know, I'm making
some changes to the way

529
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:52,791
we decide who gets to be
on the relay team.

530
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,416
[RIN]
It used to be based on speed,

531
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,875
if you were consistently fast,
you made the cut.

532
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,250
But that's not how we're
gonna do it this year.

533
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:02,625
Whether you swim relay
or go solo is your call.

534
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,875
So from now on, you'll only
be picked for relay

535
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,833
if that's your thing.

536
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:08,916
Your overall speed
is still important,

537
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,833
but just as important is
where your heart is.

538
00:21:11,916 --> 00:21:13,708
Sure, this might
be a stupid idea.

539
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,000
Times are usually
the best way to go.

540
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:18,583
A few of you probably think
I'm sacrificing our chances

541
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,000
of winning for the sake of
proving some kind of point.

542
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,666
And you're right.

543
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:26,208
But it's a point that
needs to be made.

544
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:27,708
We're a team.

545
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:30,666
And if our mutual passion
isn't what binds us together,

546
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:32,541
we could get all the way
to Nationals and have

547
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:35,000
nothing to show for it
but some stupid medals.

548
00:21:35,083 --> 00:21:37,333
More importantly, you deserve
to be led by someone

549
00:21:37,416 --> 00:21:40,250
who sees this team as a family.

550
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,375
So, you wanna swim relay,

551
00:21:41,458 --> 00:21:43,958
you show me you
believe in yourself.

552
00:21:44,041 --> 00:21:46,791
And you also
believe in your team!

553
00:23:18,208 --> 00:23:19,208
[NAGISA]
Hey, lemme ask you.

554
00:23:19,291 --> 00:23:20,750
When you eat
Iwatobi Surprise Bread,

555
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,500
do you go sideways or longways?

556
00:23:22,583 --> 00:23:24,125
[REI] Longways.
Starting at the bottom.

557
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,500
[MAKOTO]
I'd start with the top.

558
00:23:25,583 --> 00:23:26,791
[HARUKA]
I'm a sideways guy.

559
00:23:26,875 --> 00:23:27,875
[REI]
How do you do it?

560
00:23:27,958 --> 00:23:28,958
[NAGISA]
I rip it in half and go straight

561
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:30,541
for the strawberry
jam in the middle!

562
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:32,083
[MAKOTO]
That must be very messy.

563
00:23:32,166 --> 00:23:34,041
[HARUKA] Next time:
"Head-Up of Decision!"

564
00:23:34,125 --> 00:23:35,208
[NAGISA]
Check it!

565
00:23:35,291 --> 00:23:36,708
I can eat the whole thing
in five seconds!

566
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:39,208
[MAKOTO]
I'm kinda losing my appetite.
