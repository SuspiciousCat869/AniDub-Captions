[whistle blows]

2
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:13,500
Let's huddle up!

3
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:16,208
Okay, is everybody here?

4
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,166
[SASABE]
Makoto. Introduce yourself.

5
00:00:20,250 --> 00:00:21,416
Oh! Right!

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,833
Well, I uh... Hello, everyone.

7
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:26,541
My name's Makoto,
and I'm here to help

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:30,083
teach you guys how to swim.
'Cause swimming's a lot of fun.

9
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:32,291
It's really nice to meet you!

10
00:00:32,375 --> 00:00:35,041
[KIDS] It's really
nice to meet you, too!

11
00:00:36,625 --> 00:00:38,000
[MAKOTO laughs]

12
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,000
[NAGISA]
What?

13
00:02:10,083 --> 00:02:11,875
So you're working as an
assistant for Coach Sasabe

14
00:02:11,958 --> 00:02:13,583
and teaching kids
how to dog paddle?

15
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:15,541
[MAKOTO]
Mm. Yeah, bascially.

16
00:02:15,625 --> 00:02:17,583
Did you know about this, Haru?

17
00:02:17,666 --> 00:02:18,958
[HARUKA]
It's news to me.

18
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,416
I would've said
something sooner,

19
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:22,375
but I wanted to
tell you all at once.

20
00:02:22,458 --> 00:02:24,291
The Regionals are right
around the corner, my friend,

21
00:02:24,375 --> 00:02:26,041
are you sure you'll
have time to do both?

22
00:02:26,125 --> 00:02:27,916
Yeah, you're not gonna
have to miss practice,

23
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,416
are you Mako?

24
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:31,666
I promise, it won't interfere
with the team in any way.

25
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,375
It's just a couple
of times a week.

26
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:34,791
No big deal at all.

27
00:02:34,875 --> 00:02:36,333
[NAGISA] Kinda came out
of the blue though,

28
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,916
what made you decide to do it?

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,083
[MAKOTO] Mm...
Well, at practice yesterday...

30
00:02:41,166 --> 00:02:42,666
[GOU, REI]
Come on, Makoto!

31
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,666
[NAGISA]
Good job, buddy!

32
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,166
[MAKOTO]
How'd I do?

33
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,500
Well, we're still
starting a bit late.

34
00:02:52,583 --> 00:02:55,000
Yes, it doesn't seem to be
working out very well.

35
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:56,750
Let's try it one more time!

36
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,291
[HARUKA, MAKOTO]
Right!

37
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,916
Hey, is something the matter?

38
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,333
Oh, no, everything's fine,
I just need another set of eyes

39
00:03:06,416 --> 00:03:08,833
on the records from the
district tournament.

40
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,625
Coach Sasabe has been really
busy with running ISCR lately,

41
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:14,041
so he hasn't had a chance
to go over them yet.

42
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,916
I'd hate for him
not to see 'em.

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,083
And it's probably gonna be dark

44
00:03:17,166 --> 00:03:19,041
by the time practice
is over with.

45
00:03:19,125 --> 00:03:21,958
So if you want, I could drop
'em off on my way home.

46
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:23,500
[GOU]
Oh! Really?

47
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,333
Wow, thank you so much!

48
00:03:25,416 --> 00:03:26,666
[STAFF]
How are you this evening?

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,125
[MAKOTO]
Can't complain.

50
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:32,291
[SASABE]
Alright!

51
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:33,708
Coach Sasabe! Hey!

52
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,250
Well! If it isn't ol' Makoto!

53
00:03:36,333 --> 00:03:37,375
[MAKOTO]
Geez, it looks like things

54
00:03:37,458 --> 00:03:39,000
are pretty busy here tonight.

55
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,750
Yeah. We're hoppin', alright,

56
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,583
which is great and all, just
sorta hard on a skeleton crew.

57
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,833
I'm sorry I haven't been
able to watch your practices.

58
00:03:45,916 --> 00:03:47,000
It's been crazy.

59
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,208
Wow.

60
00:03:48,291 --> 00:03:50,166
Oh, I've got a little
something for you.

61
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,875
Here, Gou wanted me to pass off
the final numbers from District.

62
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:54,500
[GIRL 8C]
Coach Sasabe, hurry up!

63
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:55,166
We're waiting!

64
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:56,625
[SASABE]
Ah! Right!

65
00:03:56,708 --> 00:03:59,916
Have no fear, I'm on my way!

66
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:00,958
Hey, Coach! Wait!

67
00:04:01,041 --> 00:04:01,958
[SASABE]
Huh?

68
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,625
Uh, I could maybe
give you a hand?

69
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:04,916
What? Are you serious?

70
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,041
'Course. Unless I'd
just be in the way.

71
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:09,791
[REI] Gave in to your
better nature, eh?

72
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,291
[MAKOTO]
Coach has done so much for us.

73
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,625
I thought it might be nice
to return the favor, y'know?

74
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,250
He can use the help.

75
00:04:15,333 --> 00:04:17,041
I think that we should
work together as a team

76
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:20,541
to get ISCR out of the weeds!
We've got your back, Mako!

77
00:04:20,625 --> 00:04:21,750
Am I right?

78
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,250
I mean, you'll help us too,
won't you, Rei?

79
00:04:23,333 --> 00:04:24,916
Oh, definitely!

80
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,958
That's really nice,
I appreciate it.

81
00:04:27,041 --> 00:04:29,416
Except, don't you guys
have better things to do

82
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:31,166
than watch a bunch
of kids tread water?

83
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:33,250
Yeah, but--!

84
00:04:33,333 --> 00:04:34,625
What about you, Haru?

85
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,250
Don't you think we ought
to be there to help him out?

86
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,625
All I care about is swimming.

87
00:04:38,708 --> 00:04:41,000
Makoto can do whatever he wants.

88
00:04:41,083 --> 00:04:41,958
Haru...

89
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:43,708
Okay, well.

90
00:04:45,708 --> 00:04:48,583
[NAGISA] The only thing is,
I need to worry about myself

91
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:51,083
before I can think
about helping others.

92
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:53,375
Not only do I have to
up my game as a swimmer,

93
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:56,375
I also need to focus on making
sure I can keep my grades up.

94
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,333
I'm gonna have to
work on that first.

95
00:04:58,416 --> 00:05:01,000
I should really
put myself first, too.

96
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:02,875
I need to concentrate
on my technique

97
00:05:02,958 --> 00:05:04,208
to prep for the big tournament.

98
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:07,000
But, whatever you decide
to do, best of luck!

99
00:05:07,083 --> 00:05:08,500
Give it your all, man!

100
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:11,166
Wow, guys. Thanks.

101
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:13,833
[NAGISA] I gotta tell you,
though, I'm crazy jealous.

102
00:05:13,916 --> 00:05:15,125
We'll be working our butts off.

103
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,458
You basically get
to soak all day.

104
00:05:17,541 --> 00:05:19,333
He's there to teach, not "soak,"

105
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,041
and all we have to
worry about is us.

106
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,916
[NAGISA]
I know that.

107
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:27,083
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Well, let's get to work, guys!

108
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,666
[HARUKA, REI, NAGISA]
Yeah!

Oh! Sosuke, it's you!

00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:06,500
What are you doing here?

114
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,583
Your form's a mess
'cause you're too tired.

115
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:09,583
Huh?

116

Do you mean you
were watching me?

117
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:13,083
[SOSUKE] You won't get any
better just by swimming

118
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:17,416
as often and as hard as you can.
Your body needs time to heal.

119
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,250
Right. I'm so sorry.

120
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,708
It's just...

121
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:23,375
Well, I'm one of the slowest
people in the entire club.

122
00:06:23,458 --> 00:06:24,875
So if I want to compete,

123
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:28,166
I have to push myself harder
than everybody else.

124
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:29,666
[SOSUKE]
If you go at it too hard

125
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:32,208
you won't be able to keep doing
the things you're good at.

126
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:34,625
[SOSUKE]
I'll watch you.

127
00:06:34,708 --> 00:06:37,666
[NITORI]
Huh? You will? For real?

128
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:39,083
[SOSUKE]
Yeah, I'll watch you practice

129
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:44,208
and give pointers or whatever.
After you take a break.

130

[NITORI]
Yes!

Every time I drop by,

that poor kid's always
practicing alone.

too far apart again!

What are we gonna be
working on today?

141
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,625
I thought we'd start things off

142
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,458
with a little kicking practice,
how does that sound?

00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,416
[KISUMI] I'm really
sorry I'm late, buddy!

160
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,708
That's Kisumi.

161
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:21,083
[KISUMI]
Huh?

162
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:24,125
[MAKOTO]
Kisumi! What's up!

163
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:27,125
Makoto? Hey, man!

164
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:30,541
This is nuts, I haven't
seen you in forever!

165
00:08:30,625 --> 00:08:31,958
Yeah, it's been a while.

166
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,833
I guess we haven't seen
each other since junior high.

167
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:38,625
[HARUKA]
Kisumi?

168
00:08:38,708 --> 00:08:40,625
I know, talk about a
blast from the past, right?

169
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:44,125
I haven't thought about that
guy in who knows how long.

170
00:09:01,125 --> 00:09:02,291
[HARUKA]
Huh.

171
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,666
[MAKOTO] He's definitely
one of the last people

172
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,625
I ever expected to see again.

173
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:08,583
He came by the pool 'cause his
little brother's in my class.

174
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:09,833
So what?

175
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,500
[MAKOTO]
So, isn't that crazy?

176
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,625
I mean, you guys were joined
at the hip in junior high!

177
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:14,583
[HARUKA]
Not really.

178
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,041
[MAKOTO]
Oh.

179
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,000
Hey, you know what, if you
have a little time on Sunday

180
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,916
you should drop by
and say hello.

181
00:09:22,083 --> 00:09:23,416
Huh?

182
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,625
[HARUKA]
If I can find the time.

183
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:28,708
[MAKOTO]
Haru! You came!

184
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:31,416
Well, I'm only here because
you forgot your lunch.

185
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,250
Your mom asked me to swing
by and give it to you.

186
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,666
Oh, you didn't have to
do that, but thanks, man.

187
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,708
[SASABE]
Makoto!

188
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:38,333
Oh, Haru too, huh?

189
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:40,125
[MAKOTO, HARUKA]
Hey, good morning, Coach!

190
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:41,583
Well, kid. Since you're
already here,

191
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:43,750
how about you suit up and
have yourself a little dip?

192
00:09:43,833 --> 00:09:45,166
Uh, okay.

193
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:47,291
So, I'm dying to know:
how are the kiddos holding up?

194
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:48,541
All good?

195
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,125
It's amazing how well
they're coming along.

196
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,291
They're better every day.

197
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:52,916
Well, that's a good
thing to hear.

198
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,541
And what about Hayato?
Have you got him swimming yet?

199
00:09:55,625 --> 00:09:56,791
Hayato?

200
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:58,708
[MAKOTO] Yeah, that's
Kisumi's little brother.

201
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:00,875
Poor kid. He's afraid
of the water.

202
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,208
[SASABE] Sad, right?
Poor little guy won't

203
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,500
go anywhere near the water
without a kickboard.

204
00:10:05,583 --> 00:10:07,625
Oh, look at the time!
Somebody's coming in

205
00:10:07,708 --> 00:10:10,583
to interview for the
part-time gig, so I gotta run!

206
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,166
I'm counting on you, Makoto.
So don't let me down!

207
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,541
Haruka! Make yourself at home!

208
00:10:15,625 --> 00:10:17,375
[MAKOTO]
You wanna hear something weird?

209
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,791
Hayato told me that
he hated swimming.

210
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:22,666
It's been bothering me
ever since he said it.

211
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,958
What do you think
I should do, Haru?

212
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,416
[HARUKA]
Don't fight.

213
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,291
Huh?

214
00:10:27,375 --> 00:10:28,416
Hey, the water is what it is.

215
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:31,166
You either accept
it or you don't.

216
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:34,666
Sorry, man, I'm not gonna
say that to a little kid.

217
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,833
Oh.

218
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:36,958
I have to go too--
catch up with you later!

219
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:38,416
[HARUKA]
'Kay.

220
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:44,041
[KIDS] Thank you
very much, Coach Makoto!

221
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:49,958
Hey! Makoto!

222
00:10:50,041 --> 00:10:51,291
[MAKOTO]
Kisumi!

223
00:10:51,375 --> 00:10:53,541
[KISUMI] So, how did
Hayato do today?

224
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:54,958
[MAKOTO]
Not great.

225
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,625
He's still too scared to swim
without the kickboard.

226
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,583
Oh well. He'll get there soon.

227
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:03,666
Hey, uh--

228
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,458
There's something I've
been wondering about.

229
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:10,375
[MAKOTO] Hayato told me
that he hates swimming.

230
00:11:10,458 --> 00:11:12,708
Any idea what that's about?

231
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:16,625
If I knew why, it might
help me reach him.

232
00:11:16,708 --> 00:11:19,666
Truth is, it's
probably my fault.

233
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:21,000
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

234
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,708
[KISUMI]
A while back,

235
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:24,416
we were out on a
boat in the ocean

236
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,000
with the rest of the family.

237
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:30,916
Hayato got to screwin' around on
the deck, and he fell overboard.

238
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,041
He almost drowned out there.

239
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,166
The water wasn't deep,
but still.

240
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:39,791
We're lucky they got to him
as quickly as they did or, well.

241
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:41,125
The poor kid.

242
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:43,916
The whole thing must have
been terrifying for him.

243
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
That does sound really scary.

244
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,166
[KISUMI]
Ever since the incident,

245
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,666
he's hated his
swimming class at school.

246
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:51,083
If I'd have been better
about watching him

247
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,791
on that stupid boat, none
of this would've happened.

248
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,708
He wouldn't be afraid.

249
00:11:55,791 --> 00:11:57,291
Guess I feel like I
need to do something

250
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,958
to make up for my mistake.

251
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,291
Kisumi...

252
00:12:00,375 --> 00:12:02,541
[KISUMI] But, as much as
I want him to get past it,

253
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,791
if he hates it that much,
he should just quit.

254
00:12:04,875 --> 00:12:06,541
Especially if it's
causing him pain.

255
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,250
[MAKOTO]
Wait.

256
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,458
If it's cool, I wanna help
Hayato learn to swim.

257
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:13,041
You do?

258
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,916
You wanna hear something
kinda strange?

259
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,333
He reminds me a little of myself
when I was that age, ya know?

260
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:22,833
Look, neither of you
should give up just yet.

261
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,208
So please, let me try.

262
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:29,125
You really do love swimming

263
00:12:29,208 --> 00:12:31,333
more than anything else,
don't you, Makoto?

264
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:33,916
[MAKOTO]
Mm.

265
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,208
[KISUMI]
All right.

266
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,291
I'm leaving Hayato's
future to you, my friend.

267
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,250
If there's anything I can
do to help along the way,

268
00:12:39,333 --> 00:12:40,583
just say the word.

269
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:43,125
Thanks. I won't let you down.

270
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:43,875
[KISUMI]
Hm?

271
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:45,208
[MAKOTO]
Oh! Hey, man!

272
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:46,666
[KISUMI]
Whoa. Haru!

273
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:48,583
I haven't seen you
in forever, buddy!

274
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,583
Wow! Oh man, it's like
junior high all over again,

275
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:54,666
I haven't seen you since Rin
left to study abroad, remember?

276
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,625
We kinda' lost touch
after that though.

277
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,291
Ah, come on,
why the long face?

278
00:13:00,375 --> 00:13:02,333
Kisumi, you went to the
same elementary school

279
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:03,708
as Rin, didn't you?

280
00:13:03,791 --> 00:13:04,916
Oh! Yeah!

281
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Sosuke went there, too.

282
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,583
Makoto.

283
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,666
[MAKOTO]
Crap! Is it that late already?

284
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:10,833
Hey, let's go.

285
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,791
What's wrong man,
you mad or somethin'?

286
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,458
It's been so long, I thought
you'd be glad to see me.

287
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,125
[HARUKA sighs]
Whatever, man, I'm glad.

288
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:20,083
Heh. Way to sell it.

289
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,916
[HAYATO]
Hey, big brother!

290
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,958
[KISUMI]
Hayato!

291
00:13:23,041 --> 00:13:24,250
Well, I gotta run, you guys.

292
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:26,916
But we should catch up
or something sometime!

293
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:31,208
Guess we better get going, too.

294
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,958
[GOU] So basically,
you're trying to take a kid

295
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:36,958
who hates swimming and
make him learn to love it?

296
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:39,458
[MAKOTO] Yeah, more or less,
you got any bright ideas?

297
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:40,875
[GOU]
It's a piece of cake.

298
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,833
First, he has to focus on
floating without too much

299
00:13:42,916 --> 00:13:44,333
effort, and once
he's mastered that,

300
00:13:44,416 --> 00:13:46,333
he has to find his balance
so his hips don't sink,

301
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,333
and then he has to learn
to kick with his instep.

302
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,333
Wait a second,
do you know how to swim?

303
00:13:50,416 --> 00:13:52,041
Well no, not really.

304
00:13:52,125 --> 00:13:54,500
[REI] Then what you're saying
has no credibility whatsoever!

305
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,208
Haru, you're the expert here.
What advice would you give?

306
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:58,750
Water is what it is, man.

307
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,708
You either accept
it or you don't.

308
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:04,083
[GOU] Not exactly the best
advice to give a kid.

309
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:06,208
Hey, Rei, you just learned
how to swim recently.

310
00:14:06,291 --> 00:14:08,166
Maybe the experience is
fresh enough in your mind

311
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,166
for you to give a newcomer
a little insight?

312
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:11,583
[GOU]
Yeah, good call!

313
00:14:11,666 --> 00:14:13,500
Yes, excellent call, in fact.

314
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,791
I'm just a bit stunned it
took this long to ask me.

315
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,958
[HARUKA] Okay, then.
So, what's your advice?

316
00:14:18,041 --> 00:14:18,791
[REI]
Well!

317
00:14:18,875 --> 00:14:19,583
[GOU]
Yeah, tell us!

318
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:21,000
We're dying to know!

319
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:23,333
I couldn't swim because
no matter what I did, I sank,

320
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,500
which is obviously a huge
problem for a swimmer.

321
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:26,708
Though now that I've
said it out loud,

322
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,833
that doesn't really
apply here, does it?

323
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:29,791
Uh, no.

324
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,791
Not helpful.

325
00:14:30,875 --> 00:14:32,375
Back to the drawing board.

326
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,791
[REI]
Wait!

327
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:36,541
What are you thinking?
You have any bright ideas yet?

328
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:40,125
I'm starting to think
it might be a lost cause.

329
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,000
[MAKOTO] I'm afraid if I give
him too much advice I might

330
00:14:42,083 --> 00:14:44,000
confuse him and make
him more scared to swim

331
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,125
than he already is.

332
00:14:46,208 --> 00:14:48,625
We were all scared
of swimming at one point.

333
00:14:48,708 --> 00:14:49,708
Think about what you did

334
00:14:49,791 --> 00:14:52,125
to overcome your fears
and start there.

335
00:14:52,208 --> 00:14:54,583
Well, when I first
started out...

336
00:14:56,041 --> 00:14:58,250
[MAKOTO] I realized when
I swam the backstroke,

337
00:14:58,333 --> 00:15:00,958
I could see the sky.

338
00:15:01,041 --> 00:15:04,875
And then I wasn't
scared anymore.

339
00:15:04,958 --> 00:15:07,291
But, these days they don't
usually teach backstroke

340
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,500
until much later, so that
doesn't really help us.

341
00:15:10,583 --> 00:15:12,541
[HARUKA] Yeah, but who
cares what "they" do?

342
00:15:12,625 --> 00:15:13,833
Huh?

343
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,333
You're the teacher.
Do it how you wanna do it.

344
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:17,958
Yeah?

345
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:24,500
You know, you're right.
I might just give it a try.

346
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,250
[MAKOTO] Alright! We'll
finish up with a relay.

347
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:31,250
What do you guys
think about that?

348
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:32,208
[GIRLS] --Whoa!
--Oh, wow!

349
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:33,166
Wait, what's a relay?

350
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,208
[BOY 8B]
That sounds cool!

351
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,583
[GIRL 8B]
And fun too!

352
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,875
[MAKOTO]
It is! Now let's get ready!

353
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:39,666
We'll split up into two groups.

354
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,458
The first person will swim
from one side to the other,

355
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:45,250
high five the next swimmer
and then it's their turn.

356
00:15:45,333 --> 00:15:47,750
You can stop and stand up in
the middle if you need to.

357
00:15:47,833 --> 00:15:49,541
Okay? You guys ready?

358
00:15:49,625 --> 00:15:51,416
[KIDS]
Yeah!

359
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:54,625
All right then! Let's go!

360
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,333
--[GIRL 8B] Gimme five.
--[BOY 8A] All right!

361
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:03,375
[GIRLS]
Yeah!

362
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,791
Good job, team!

363
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:12,833
[HAYATO whimpering]

364
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:14,875
[MAKOTO]
Hayato. I've got an idea:

365
00:16:14,958 --> 00:16:17,250
how about we try a different
style of swimming?

366
00:16:17,333 --> 00:16:18,541
It's one where
you don't have to

367
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,000
put your face in the water.

368
00:16:20,083 --> 00:16:23,083
You know, you can even look
at the sky while you swim.

369
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,250
That sounds cool.

370
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:26,375
But there's no way
I could do that.

371
00:16:26,458 --> 00:16:28,083
I promise to hold you
up the whole time,

372
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,708
so don't worry.

373
00:16:29,791 --> 00:16:32,208
No matter what happens,
I won't let you sink.

374
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,708
I can't do it.

375
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:39,791
Because... 'cause I'm... scared!

376
00:16:39,875 --> 00:16:41,083
[MAKOTO]
It's okay.

377
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:43,208
I won't let go,
you have my word.

378
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,083
Trust me.

379
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:50,041
But isn't it scary?

380
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,041
Only 'til it's not.

381
00:16:54,833 --> 00:16:56,041
[GIRL 8B]
We believe in you!

382
00:16:56,125 --> 00:16:57,416
--[BOY 8A] Come on!
--[GIRL 8A] You can do it!

383
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,750
Let's go.

384
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,250
All you have to do is kick
your legs in the water

385
00:17:00,333 --> 00:17:02,500
to move forward. You got this!

386
00:17:03,583 --> 00:17:06,833
[MAKOTO]
Okay, now slowly open your eyes.

387
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,750

[HAYATO giggles]

389
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,541
Wow! The backstroke?

390
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:27,000
High five!

391
00:17:29,625 --> 00:17:30,666
[HAYATO]
Thanks!

392
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:32,416
[MAKOTO]
Last one! You can do it!

393
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:34,416
Yeah! All right!

394
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:42,208
[KISUMI]
Hayato!

395

[MAKOTO]
Hayato?

401
00:17:57,333 --> 00:17:58,541
So, I uh...

402
00:17:58,625 --> 00:18:03,666
Well, I want you to know
I'm not afraid anymore!

403
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,750
It was really fun!

404
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:11,583
That's because you
worked so hard out there.

405
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:14,583
[HAYATO gasps]
Wow. Thank you.

406
00:18:14,666 --> 00:18:16,416
This was amazing, Coach!

407
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:18,625
[MAKOTO chuckles]

408
00:18:21,583 --> 00:18:22,416
[MAKOTO]
Good work today!

409
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,333
[STAFF]
Yeah, you too!

410
00:18:25,416 --> 00:18:26,916
[SASABE]
Hey Makoto, hold up a sec!

411
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,125
I wanted to let you know I
hired a new part-timer today,

412
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,333
so we won't need ya anymore.
You're off the hook.

413
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,541
Uh--

414
00:18:32,625 --> 00:18:33,708
[SASABE] It'll be a
week before he starts,

415
00:18:33,791 --> 00:18:35,416
so I can use you 'til then.

416
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,000
What's wrong? I thought
you would be thrilled.

417
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:40,833
Uh, oh, yeah.

418
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,041
[SASABE]
Well! Thanks for the help

419
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:43,750
and be safe going home.

We wanted to
surprise you, brother!

They both said
they wanted to see

your coaching in
action. That cool?

Yes, of course it is.

be your last day?

Hayato was kind of upset.

466

He told me he wished you could
be his swim coach forever.

happy I am to hear that!

learned how to swim.

470
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:44,833
And I will always be
grateful for that.

471
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:47,041
Hey, it was really great
catching up with you, guys.

472
00:20:47,125 --> 00:20:49,875
I can see that neither of you
have changed one bit.

473
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,666
I assume you two are still
both swimming together, right?

474
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,916
Oh yeah, actually we're
gettin' ready for Regionals.

475
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,166
Awesome.

476
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,875
Thanks, man. They're right
around the corner,

477
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,958
so, you know, we're pretty
much down to the wire.

478
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,208
Whoa!

479
00:21:01,291 --> 00:21:03,416
That's really amazing,
man, congratulations!

480
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:04,833
Actually, Rin and
Sosuke will both

481
00:21:04,916 --> 00:21:07,166
be at the tournament
swimming for Samezuka.

482
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:09,250
Wow! Wait, Sosuke too?

483
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,041
[MAKOTO]
Yep.

484
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:11,125
That's great news,

485
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,916
then Sosuke's shoulder
must be healed!

486
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,041
[HARUKA]
Hm?

487
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:15,916
Wait, what? What're
you talkin' about?

488
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,541
Well, I saw him
at the hospital once.

489
00:21:22,875 --> 00:21:25,791
Hey, man. Sosuke?

490
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:31,000
But if he's competing
at the Regional level,

491
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:34,875
I'm guessin' that means they
fixed it. Awesome for him!

492
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:39,291
Well, I gotta run. See ya
later, Makoto! Haru! Bye!

493
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,750
[SOSUKE]
Haruka. Moment of truth.

494
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:25,541
You ready to sacrifice
everything for your dream?

495
00:23:25,625 --> 00:23:27,958
'Cause like it or not,
that's what it takes.

496
00:23:28,041 --> 00:23:30,250
If you don't have it
in you, way I see it,

497
00:23:30,333 --> 00:23:31,875
you got no right to be here.

498
00:23:31,958 --> 00:23:34,666
[HARUKA]
What are you--? My dream?

499
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,125
I don't have one.

500
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:38,708
[SOSUKE] Next time:
"Forming of Disruption!"

501
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:40,625
[HARUKA]
Why do I swim?
