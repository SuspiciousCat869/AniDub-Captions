1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,166
[NITORI] Rin, I know we've only
roomed together for a year,

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:12,958
but I just wanted to say thank
you for everything you've done.

3
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:15,500
Dude, relax, what are you
gettin' so emotional about?

4
00:00:15,583 --> 00:00:17,708
We're just changing rooms
'cause it's a new school year.

5
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:20,666
[NITORI sniffles]
Yeah, I suppose you're right.

6
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:23,791
I won't be around
to clean up after you,

7
00:00:23,875 --> 00:00:25,791
so you'll have to deal
with your own mess.

8
00:00:25,875 --> 00:00:27,291
Later.

9
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:30,791
[RIN]
One more thing...

10
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:32,375
Uh! What is it?

11
00:00:32,458 --> 00:00:34,958
Just make sure you look
after this guy too, okay?

12
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:36,208
Yo! Bro!

13
00:00:36,291 --> 00:00:37,916
How cool is it that
we're roomin' together?

14
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,500
I think it's better if I take
the top bunk, though, right?

15
00:00:40,583 --> 00:00:41,500
Yeah, sure, okay.

16
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:43,083
[MOMOTARO]
All right! Yoohoo!

17
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:44,833
[NITORI] I mean, I'm glad
he joined the swim team

18
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,916
and everything, but the thought
of sharing a room with Momo

19
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,166
for a whole year makes me
a little bit sick to my stomach.

20
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,333
[SOSUKE]
Rin.

21
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:53,416
If I remember,

22
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,250
You're more of a
bottom bunk type of guy.

23
00:00:55,333 --> 00:00:56,125
Yeah, but,

24
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:58,333
somethin' tells me you are too.

25
00:01:00,541 --> 00:01:02,000
[RIN, SOUSUKE]
Let's go!

26
00:01:02,083 --> 00:01:03,083
[RIN] Hm?
[SOSUKE] Uh?

27
00:01:03,166 --> 00:01:04,833
[SOSUKE]
Iwatobi Fest?

28
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:05,833
[RIN]
Oh yeah.

29
00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:07,291
Gou sent that to me actually.

30
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:09,541
The fest is today.
What, are you not gonna go?

31
00:01:09,625 --> 00:01:12,333
[RIN] Ah, I don't have
time for that stuff.

32
00:01:12,416 --> 00:01:14,541
[SOSUKE] Hey, you ought'a go
see her sometimes, you know?

33
00:01:14,625 --> 00:01:18,208
It makes her sad when you get
all withdrawn and distant.

34
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,458
[door slams]

35
00:01:19,541 --> 00:01:22,041
Who're you talking about?
Is it Gou?

36
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,500
[RIN] If I were you, I'd hurry
up and get to the pool.

37
00:01:25,583 --> 00:01:27,541
[MOMOTARO]
Come on, dude, I can't breathe!

38
00:01:27,625 --> 00:01:29,916
[GOU] The Iwatobi Fest
is our club's last chance

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,458
to recruit new members!
If we win the inter-club relay,

40
00:01:32,541 --> 00:01:34,375
everybody is gonna
wanna join our team!

41
00:01:34,458 --> 00:01:36,250
So make sure you
bring your "A-game".

42
00:01:36,333 --> 00:01:39,375
Go out there and do what I know
all of you are capable of doing!

43
00:01:39,458 --> 00:01:41,958
Let's race to victory and
rope in some new members,

44
00:01:42,041 --> 00:01:43,583
preferably ones with
wonderful muscles

45
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:45,291
and tight, washboard abs!

46
00:01:45,375 --> 00:01:46,958
[GROUP]
Yeah!

47
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:20,250
[ANNOUNCER 3A] And now it's
time for the main event!

48
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,916
Iwatobi's famous
inter-club relay!

49
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,291
Let's meet the competitors,
the Tennis, Basketball, Rugby,

50
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:29,083
Kendo, Judo and Swim Clubs.

51
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:31,416
But which will find
victory in the end?

52
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,958
All right, here we go!

53
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:37,000
[REFEREE 3A]
On your marks...

54
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:39,083
Get set...

55
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,541
[bang]

56
00:03:40,625 --> 00:03:42,875
[HARUKA]
The wind is alive too.

57
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,166
[MAKOTO gasps]

58
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:46,041
[HARUKA] The moment
you take your first step.

59
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:50,500
It bares its fangs and
hits you with everything.

60
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,958
But even then, there's
nothing to worry about.

61
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,750
You don't fight
against the wind.

62
00:03:54,833 --> 00:03:58,041
You use your fingers to make
a space and let your body

63
00:03:58,125 --> 00:03:59,666
slip right on through.

64
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,000

[GOU]
Wow, perfect form.

He's so slow.

70
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:10,958
[ANNOUNCER 3A]
The Swim Club is in last place!

71
00:04:11,041 --> 00:04:13,041
I'm no expert on
the subject but still.

72
00:04:13,125 --> 00:04:15,583
It looks to me like
he's no good on land.

73
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:16,875
[MAKOTO]
Haru!

[HARUKA]
Makoto!

75
00:04:19,875 --> 00:04:21,000
[ANNOUNCER 3A]
Amazing!

76
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:22,875
That's the smoothest
handoff I've ever seen!

77
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,000
Looks like the Swim Club
is really in sync!

78
00:04:25,083 --> 00:04:26,750
And they're catching up
to the top of the pack!

79
00:04:26,833 --> 00:04:27,916
The Basketball Club
is in the lead...

80
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,125
Whoa, they're in third place!

81
00:04:29,208 --> 00:04:31,041
Makoto, run like your
life depends on it!

82

[ANNOUNCER 3A]
Oh no!

85
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,375
The Swim Club's kickboard is in
the air, but he retrieves it!

86
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:41,208
Now the Swim Club needs to
catch up again from last place!

87
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,208
He's doing everything he can...

88
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:43,541
Gosh, he's almost there.

89
00:04:43,625 --> 00:04:46,208
If only they hadn't dropped
the darn kickboard.

90
00:04:46,291 --> 00:04:47,333
Just you wait.

91

[REI]
Wind speed, 1.5.

Assuming a speed
of 23 kilometers,

94
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,958
given Nagisa's height,
receiving a kickboard

95
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,083
with X amount of surface area,
if I pick the arm

96
00:04:57,166 --> 00:05:00,166
with the least wind resistance,
I should be right as rain.

97

[ANNOUNCER 3A]
Whoa!

Now that's advanced
baton handling!

Hey, I thought the
track and field team

102
00:05:06,958 --> 00:05:09,208
didn't enter this event!
It's anybody's race!

103
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,541
But who will it be?

104
00:05:10,625 --> 00:05:12,375
Who's gonna be the victor?

would've shown up for sure!

Well, no matter how
strong we are at running,

113
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,416
at the end of the day,
we're still a Swim Club.

could out there you guys.

Now we just wait patiently.

what happens today right?

[MAKOTO]
They open the pool!

119
00:05:44,125 --> 00:05:45,625
Let's forget the race
and the recruiting

120
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:48,333
and switch gears to the
upcoming District Tournament.

121
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:51,708
Be careful warming up.
That water is ice cold.

122

We have a few days before
we have to turn in our forms.

In addition to individual races,

00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:58,458
we'll probably wanna sign up
for something else.

it could be...

We'll enter the relay.

135

entering the freestyle
category too.

[NAGISA]
Really?

140
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:28,500
In that case, maybe I'll
try swimming butterfly!

141
00:06:28,583 --> 00:06:31,208
[MAKOTO chuckles] But that's
your worst stroke, isn't it?

00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:04,875
Even my doing the backstroke.

160
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,583
If you set your mind to it,
it's more than possible.

161
00:07:07,666 --> 00:07:10,666
I'm sure it'll be an
amazing thing to behold.

162
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,791
[REI]
In that case, I'm in!

163
00:07:12,875 --> 00:07:15,208
Hm! I'll present my
backstroke, breaststroke

164
00:07:15,291 --> 00:07:18,375
and freestyle to you all.
And it will be breathtaking!

165
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,291
[GOU, NAGISA]
Hooray!

Man, I suck!

00:07:27,333 --> 00:07:28,666
Oh, Don't worry about it!

Hey! You didn't suck,
your form was great!

Take your time and relax.
No sense rushing it, okay?

[HARUKA]
Rei.

00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,875
[REI]
Huh?

173
00:07:37,958 --> 00:07:39,583
If you don't wanna
swim other strokes,

174
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,375
then there's no point in
forcing yourself to do it.

175
00:07:42,458 --> 00:07:44,041
As long as there's
one style of swimming

176
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,958
that suits you. That's enough.

177
00:07:51,083 --> 00:07:53,416
[REI] I can't stop thinking
about what Haru said.

178
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:57,541
But, the problem is I don't
know if I agree with him.

179
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,250
I'm trying as hard as I can,

180
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:02,458
but I can't even keep up
with my teammates.

181
00:08:02,541 --> 00:08:04,750
If underclassmen joined
the Swim Club today.

182
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,291
I don't think I
could legitimately

183
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,708
call myself their senior.
Besides, despite what Haru says

184
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,208
I want to excel at
a number of things.

185
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,875
In the end, butterfly's
simply not enou--

How've you been Ryugazaki?

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,375
[REI]
Sera, what's up?

189
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,583
I watched you and your team run

190
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,416
in the inter-club relay,
and I gotta say,

191
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:24,083
I was really impressed
with your speed.

192
00:08:24,166 --> 00:08:26,625
Thanks for the compliment,
but we're a Swim Club,

193
00:08:26,708 --> 00:08:28,416
so me being fleet of
foot doesn't exactly

194
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,125
do us much good, does it?

195
00:08:30,208 --> 00:08:32,125
[SERA]
Hm.

196
00:08:34,750 --> 00:08:36,333
[SERA]
Yeah, I guess that's true.

197
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,791
It sure would help the
Track and Field Club though.

198
00:08:38,875 --> 00:08:39,791
Huh?

199
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,333
You shine on the land.

200
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,500
Look, I'm just sayin', if you
wanna come back and join us,

201
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:46,666
we'd love to have you.
How are you in the water anyway?

202
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,041
Are you any good at it?

203
00:08:48,125 --> 00:08:50,750
Well. I mean, I'm new, but...

204
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,500
Uh--

205
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,541
[SERA] The offer's on the table
if you change your mind.

206
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,666
And I, for one, hope you do.

207
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:02,458
Cause we could use ya.
I'll see ya later.

[HARUKA sighs]

209
00:09:13,541 --> 00:09:15,291
[GOU]
Hey, Haruka.

210
00:09:15,375 --> 00:09:17,583
Is something
the matter with you?

211
00:09:19,416 --> 00:09:20,791
[HARUKA]
Can I ask you something?

212
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:22,541
[GOU]
Hm?

213
00:09:22,625 --> 00:09:24,583
I heard a college scout
came at Sosuke

214
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:27,166
with a full court press.
But, he decided he wanted

215
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,541
to swim at home during his
last year in high school,

216
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,791
so I guess that's why he
transferred to Samezuka.

217
00:09:32,875 --> 00:09:34,250
If you know what's
good for you,

218
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,791
you'll stay out of Rin's way.

219
00:09:35,875 --> 00:09:39,291
So what's up? Did something
happen with Sosuke?

220
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,333
Doesn't matter.

221
00:09:42,625 --> 00:09:44,166
You'll get scouted too!

222
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,250
Especially if you do well
in the tournament!

It's a big opportunity
to show your stuff!

224
00:09:49,041 --> 00:09:50,916

I swim for myself.

225
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,916
No one else.

229
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,458
[MAKOTO]
Especially compared to the pool.

230
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,791
It's freezing in there.

231
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,708
[REI]
He swims for himself.

232
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:07,958
Not for anybody else.
Who do I swim for?

233

[NAGISA] And then, Haru's eyes
went all sparkly like, huzzah!

Hey! Rei! What do
you say we head over

236

to Haru's house and
hang out for a little while?

Sorry, but I can't.

made plans tonight, so I'll
have to take a rain-check.

Is he okay?

[TEACHER 3A] Along those lines,
there is a profound connection

between the book

I can't believe I fell asleep

[NAGISA] Something weird
is going on with Rei!

I think you're overreacting.

a girlfriend.

Oh my goodness!

There are two types
of men in this world.

Those who get stronger when
pricked by cupid's arrow

and those who get weaker.

Was that an impression
of Miss Amakata?

become so wrapped up

Nothing's "going on" with me.

314
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:54,333
[REI laughs]
Enamored?

315
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,625
That's the most ridiculous
thing that I've ever heard!

316
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,458
Huh? So you're not in love?

317
00:12:58,541 --> 00:12:59,708
Of course not!

318
00:12:59,791 --> 00:13:01,333
You really think I'd be
dumb enough to fall prey

319
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:05,208
to something so preposterously
illogical as love?

320
00:13:05,291 --> 00:13:07,541
Then why were you looking
at cakes the other day?

321
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:10,125
Uh. Because I suddenly felt like

322
00:13:10,208 --> 00:13:11,708
eating some cake,
what's wrong with that?

323
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,958
Just tell me the truth. Where
have you been disappearing to?

324
00:13:14,041 --> 00:13:15,666
[REI] Nowhere, I've just
been busy, that's all.

325
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:17,000
Busy with what exactly?

326
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,750
Just stuff, you know,
stuff that, when I do it,

327
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:21,291
keeps me busy. It's not like
I'm breaking any ethical code

328
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:23,291
withholding my whereabouts!

329
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:25,708
Uh! Speaking of which, I have
something today that's liable

330
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,041
to keep me very occupied
indeed, so, goodbye!

331
00:13:30,541 --> 00:13:32,083
Yeah. You're right.

332
00:13:32,166 --> 00:13:33,458
He's bein' weird.

333
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:38,250

[knocking]

335
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:41,041
[MOMOTARO]
Hey Rin, sorry to bother you.

336
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,041
But would you be willing to take
a look at my training regimen

337
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,875
for tomorrow morning? Ah!

338
00:13:44,958 --> 00:13:46,291

339
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:47,250
Hey.

340
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,625
Uh! I can come back!

341
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,250
[RIN]
No, just get on with it.

342
00:13:51,333 --> 00:13:53,375
[MOMOTARO]
Wait, uh!

343
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:56,750
So. Are those, like, some
homemade cookies or somethin'?

344
00:13:56,833 --> 00:13:58,083
Why, do you want one?

345
00:13:58,166 --> 00:14:00,083
[MOMOTARO]
Uh! Oh yeah!

346
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,208
Yahoo!

347
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:05,958
[MOMOTARO]
Oh man, that is so good!

348
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,833
Can I have another one?

349
00:14:07,916 --> 00:14:10,083
Didn't you hear me?
I said "one."

350
00:14:10,166 --> 00:14:12,208
[MOMOTARO]
Stingy!

351
00:14:13,125 --> 00:14:15,791
[SERA]
Oh! What's up, Rei?

352
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,250
[REI]
Not much.

353
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:20,208
Look, about our little
discussion the other day...

354
00:14:23,083 --> 00:14:24,458
Who is that?

355
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:28,666
He has beautiful
brachioradialis muscles!

356
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,875
Oh no! I didn't mean that!

357
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,583
Could it be...?

358
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,583
[GOU]
I'm telling you, I saw them!

359
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:36,791
[MAKOTO]
So, what happened?

360
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:38,125
[NAGISA]
Come on!

361
00:14:38,208 --> 00:14:41,333
[GOU]
Well. It was--

362
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:43,416
I don't know
how to say this.

363
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,166
But the truth is...

364
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,333
I think he might've
been Rei's boyfriend!

365
00:14:47,416 --> 00:14:48,083
[MAKOTO, NAGISA]
What?

366
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,166
[NAGISA]
No way!

367
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,750
Guys.

368
00:14:50,833 --> 00:14:52,916
We're jumping to conclusions,
they're probably just friends.

369
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,083
Hey, I know who
you're talking about.

370
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,791
[GOU] That's him, with the
brachioradialis muscles!

371
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,833
Hold on.

372
00:14:58,916 --> 00:15:01,041
Isn't he the
track and field captain?

373
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,333
You really think Rei
and this guy might be--?

374
00:15:03,416 --> 00:15:04,916
Or maybe after
running in the relay,

375
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,583
Rei decided he missed
track and field.

376
00:15:06,666 --> 00:15:08,750
Wait, you think he's
considering going back?

377
00:15:08,833 --> 00:15:10,083
Makoto!

378
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:11,458
Are you saying he's going
to quit the Swim Club?

379
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,500
No way! He can't
do that! It's not fair!

380
00:15:14,583 --> 00:15:15,750
Yeah, you're right.

381
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:16,916
[NAGISA]
Huh?

382
00:15:18,583 --> 00:15:22,125
Don't worry, I'm not
gonna let that happen.

383
00:15:22,208 --> 00:15:25,000
[REI]
I'm sorry I'm running late.

384
00:15:25,083 --> 00:15:25,958
Hey, what's going on?

385
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,875
Oh, nothing's going on.

386
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:29,125
Nothing at all.

387
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,500
We're just wondering if
you're "occupied" again?

388
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,583
Um-- I might be.

389
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:34,958
[MAKOTO]
In that case...

390
00:15:35,041 --> 00:15:36,416
Club's cancelled today.

391
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,958
I call an emergency meeting
at Haru's house!

392
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:40,166
[GOU, NAGISA]
Yeah!

Hip. Hip. Hooray!

394
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:46,583
[REI]
So, uh...

395
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,416
Does someone wanna tell me
what this meeting's all about?

396
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,791
Let's see. Uh. Well...

397
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,125
I guess it slipped my mind?

398
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,625
Hey, don't look at me.

399
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,458
It's about uh...

400
00:15:55,541 --> 00:15:56,875
Oh, I remember!
It's about a tasting

401
00:15:56,958 --> 00:15:58,291
for new mackerel recipes.

402
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,375
Oh, come on, does that
sound like an emergency to you?

403
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:02,458
[HARUKA] This was your
genius plan, you go for it.

404
00:16:02,541 --> 00:16:03,500
[MAKOTO whispering]
No. You go.

405

[REI]
If there's nothing pressing,

406
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,208
I have somewhere to be,

407
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:07,875
if you'll be kind enough
to excuse me...

[REI]
What is wrong with you?

411
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:14,833
[NAGISA] Whatever you do,
don't quit the Swim Club!

412
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:16,000
Huh?

413
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,041
[NAGISA] We know what
you've been up to.

414
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,583
Don't deny it.

415
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:22,250
You're leaving us for the Track
and Field Club, aren't you?

416
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:23,250
It's not fair!

417
00:16:23,333 --> 00:16:24,750
You can't leave!

418
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,083
But, Nagisa--

419
00:16:26,166 --> 00:16:27,833
[MAKOTO]
He's right, Rei.

420
00:16:27,916 --> 00:16:29,791
We're not just gonna
let you quit like this.

421
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,708
What kind of teammates
would that make us?

422
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:33,875
As your manager,
I'm afraid that I can't accept

423

you leaving either, Rei.

00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:38,000
Listen, Rin and I were
saved because of you.

425
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:40,750
After everything,
you're just gonna quit now?

426
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,250
I'm not gonna
stand for it. Period.

427

[HARUKA]
Besides, man.

428
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:48,333
You're the one who wanted the
four of us to go to Nationals!

429
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,750
I did say that, didn't I?

430
00:16:50,833 --> 00:16:51,833
[NAGISA]
You promised!

431
00:16:51,916 --> 00:16:53,291
Do you remember what you said?

432
00:16:53,375 --> 00:16:55,833
You swore we would all four
swim a relay together!

433
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:57,583
You gave us your word
that you'd show us

434
00:16:57,666 --> 00:17:00,125
a beautiful butterfly
stroke at Nationals!

435

You can't abandon us now!

You guys are sweet.

But I don't know what
you're talking about.

Rest assured, if you
think I'm gonna quit,

439
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,375
you're barking up
the wrong tree.

440
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:16,375
But you were with the captain
of the Track and Field Club.

441
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,541
Wait a sec, you saw us?

442
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:21,625
He did ask me to come back,
but that's all it was, I swear.

Trust me on this, guys.
It's nothing.

too important to me.

Now that we've resolved
that misunderstanding,

00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:39,125
I've got somewhere I need to be,
so I'd better get going.

He leaves us no choice.

[MAKOTO]
Are we where I think we are?

Guys, this is Samezuka Academy.

[RIN]
That's it. Looks good.

455
00:17:55,833 --> 00:17:58,250
Use your hips as a center
to find your balance.

456
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,875
Don't forget to paddle
at the same time you exhale.

457
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:04,125
And remember to do the thing
I taught you earlier, okay?

make it this far.

470
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:40,458
I've been thinking about
this for a while now...

471
00:18:40,541 --> 00:18:42,791
I thought I could be like Haru.

472
00:18:42,875 --> 00:18:45,666
Be content with mastering the
butterfly and nothing else.

473
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:49,000
There was definitely no
beauty in me flailing around.

474
00:18:49,083 --> 00:18:51,208
And I thought, "if that's
really the best I can do,

475
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:53,708
why even bother?
I'd rather just quit."

476
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:58,083
However, I am no quitter.

477
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:01,208
How could I live with myself
if I gave up that easily?

478
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,958
[RIN]
Hm?

479
00:19:05,125 --> 00:19:07,041
[REI] I'm sorry for making
you help me everyday,

480
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,541
I'm sure it gets on your nerves.

481
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,833
[RIN] If it's after practice,
I don't mind.

482
00:19:10,916 --> 00:19:12,000
Besides...

483
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:14,541
All things considered,
I think I owe you.

484
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:16,666
[REI]
What?

485
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,333
[RIN]
Ah, forget about it.

486
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,000
Are we here to talk or work?

487
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,541
If you want those guys
to be surprised

488
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:24,625
then you have a long way to go.

489
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,166
[REI]
Right!

490
00:19:26,250 --> 00:19:27,416
Oh, wow...

491
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,708
So the reason Rei's doing this

492
00:19:28,791 --> 00:19:30,291
is 'cause he wants
to surprise us?

493
00:19:30,375 --> 00:19:31,791
Yep.

494
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:35,666
[NAGISA]
Guys!

495
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,000
Can you believe it, Rei's
swimming the breaststroke?

496
00:19:37,083 --> 00:19:38,000
[GROUP gasps]

497
00:19:38,083 --> 00:19:39,208
[MAKOTO]
Awesome!

498
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,541
[NAGISA]
He did the turn too!

499
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:41,625
[MAKOTO]
This is unbelievable!

500
00:19:41,708 --> 00:19:43,000
[GOU] You guys,
he's swimming this way!

501
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,375
[NAGISA]
Crap!

502
00:19:44,458 --> 00:19:46,041
[door creaks]

503
00:19:46,125 --> 00:19:47,416
[RIN sighs]

504
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:49,125
[SOSUKE] I can't believe
you're doing this every day.

505
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,541
Shut up.

506
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,916
[RIN] We're on different teams,
but we're still friends.

507
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,458
Besides, seeing him leave
it all out there like that...

508
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:57,958
Makes me want to train harder

509
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,208
and give everything
I've got, too.

510
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:03,875
'Cause you're doing
it all for them... Right?

511
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:05,791
[RIN]
Anyway, today was the last day.

512
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,416
Looks like he's gotten
the hang of it.

513
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:09,708
He should be fine.

514
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:14,666
No joke. That guy
worked his tail off. Wow.

515
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,250
Well, I'm glad, Rin.

516
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:25,166
[NITORI]
Hey. What's that?

517
00:20:25,250 --> 00:20:27,083
Oh, these are Gou's
famous homemade cookies.

518
00:20:27,166 --> 00:20:28,791
I asked Rin if I could
please have another,

519
00:20:28,875 --> 00:20:30,541
and he told me that
I could help myself!

520
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,458
Uh, I'm sorry to
burst your bubble,

521
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,041
but Gou didn't
make those. Rei did.

522
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,375
Ah!

523
00:20:35,458 --> 00:20:36,750
[NITORI] Apparently, he was
gonna go with making

524
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,916
Rin a cake at first.
Y'know, as a way to say

525
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
"thanks for all the help,"
but when he thought about

526
00:20:41,083 --> 00:20:42,750
Rin's physical condition,
he figured it'd be better

527
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:45,625
to bake him, like,
health-food cookies.

528
00:20:46,875 --> 00:20:48,500
[REI]
Thanks for waiting, everyone!

529
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,083
Get ready!

530
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:53,250
Because the time to reveal my
new form has arrived at last!

531
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:56,166
[REI chuckles]
Try not to be too surprised.

532
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,875
And away we go!

533
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,666
[water splashes]

534
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:03,958
Look, Rei is swimming freestyle.

535
00:21:04,041 --> 00:21:05,208
It's so amazing!.

536
00:21:05,291 --> 00:21:06,708
He really did learn
all the strokes!

537
00:21:06,791 --> 00:21:08,416
Can you guys believe it?

538
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,083
You're not acting
surprised enough.

539
00:21:10,166 --> 00:21:12,458
Why can't you try to put
a little more into it!

540
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,208
Wow! Holy Mackerel!

541
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:15,708
Yeah, how did he learn
to swim like that?

542
00:21:15,791 --> 00:21:17,916
I'm truly flabbergasted
beyond words!

543
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,458
You three really are
hopeless, aren't you?

544
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:22,625
You know, I think it's better
if we just tell him the truth.

545
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:24,583
[MAKOTO] Have you completely
lost your mind?

546
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:27,833
All right. Guys. So.

547
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:30,958
Wh-Wha-What'd you
think of my swimming?

548
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,375
You're shocked, aren't you?

549
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:36,958
You'd have never seen this
coming in a million years!

550
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:40,583
[HARUKA] Rei. You worked
really hard, huh?

551
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:46,416
I did!

552
00:23:18,250 --> 00:23:20,583
[NAGISA] Hey, I wanna try
your cookies too, Rei!

553
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:22,208
[REI] I've got a special
surprise for you:

554
00:23:22,291 --> 00:23:24,125
a cookie with the
vitamin C of 30 lemons

555
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,750
crammed into one
delicious treat!

556
00:23:25,833 --> 00:23:27,458
[NAGISA]
So, a sour cookie?

557
00:23:27,541 --> 00:23:30,125
[REI] If you convert the vitamin
C of 30 lemons to mackerel,

558
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:31,708
you'll get 50 mackerels worth.

559
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,208
[NAGISA]
All right!

560
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:34,541
[REI] I wonder what mackerel
cookies would taste like...

561
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:36,708
[HARUKA] Next time:
"Somersault Turn of Promise"

562
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,791
[REI]
What I wanna know is:

563
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,666
what happened in
Rin and Sosuke's past?
