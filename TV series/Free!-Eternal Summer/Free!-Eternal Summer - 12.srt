1
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,541
[IMMIGRATION OFFICER 12A] What's
the reason for your visit?

2
00:00:25,125 --> 00:00:27,125
What do I tell him?

3
00:00:27,208 --> 00:00:28,625
We're sightseeing.

4
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,791
Slow down.

5
00:00:41,291 --> 00:00:42,333
Yo!

6
00:00:42,416 --> 00:00:45,208
Feel like tellin' me
where we're going?

7
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:46,916
[RIN]
You wanna know, follow me.

8
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,958
Right now, we're getting
on a bus. Come on.

9
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:52,208
Dude, what the--? Ugh!

10
00:02:33,333 --> 00:02:35,916
[NAGISA]
What? You're kidding!

11
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,750
Haru booked it all
the way to Australia?

12
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:39,500
I can't make
heads or tails of it.

13
00:02:39,583 --> 00:02:43,208
I mean, seriously, what would
possess Rin to go back there?

14
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:45,125
[MAKOTO] I knew he was tryin'
to get through to him and all,

15
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:48,125
but Australia?
I guess I didn't realize

16
00:02:48,208 --> 00:02:50,083
know how far Rin would
go to make his point.

17
00:02:50,166 --> 00:02:52,583
[REI] What in the world does
he think he'll accomplish?

18
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:55,458
[MAKOTO]
Who knows, man?

19
00:02:55,541 --> 00:02:58,875
I mean, your guess
is as good as mine.

20
00:02:58,958 --> 00:03:01,375
But Rin's got something up his
sleeve, and I think it might

21
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:06,583
be a wake-up call for Haru.
At least I hope so.

22
00:03:06,666 --> 00:03:08,833
[NAGISA]
Hm. Yeah, I'm with you.

23
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:11,291
As long as he figures out
what makes him happy.

24
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:13,958
[BIRD whistles]

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,333
[HARUKA sighs]

26
00:03:39,166 --> 00:03:40,375
[HARUKA]
Rin?

27
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:46,208
Rin? Where the--?

28
00:03:47,083 --> 00:03:48,375
[RIN]
Over here.

29
00:03:51,041 --> 00:03:53,208
Figured you may be thirsty.

30
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,583
You alright?

31
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:58,500
You can't run off on me
like that, man.

32
00:04:00,750 --> 00:04:01,916
[RIN]
Sorry.

33
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,875
While we're at it,
I'm sorry for what I said.

34
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,250
[RIN] You think your
friends want to watch

35
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,208
you piss away your future?

36
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:18,958
No one asked you to
care about my future!

37
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:22,208
[RIN] I wasn't looking
at your side of things.

38
00:04:22,291 --> 00:04:26,541
I was just puttin' all
my own crap on you.

39
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,375
[RIN sighs]
So, yeah.

40
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:33,375
Thing is, there's something
I want you to know.

41
00:04:33,458 --> 00:04:35,666
When it's all said and done,

42
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:38,250
you've always been
someone I looked up to.

43
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,208
[HARUKA gasps]

44
00:04:40,291 --> 00:04:44,000
[RIN]
Whew! That's a load off, huh?

45
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,750
Let's go.

46
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:47,125
Go where?

47
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:52,458
[RIN] Hm? Cut me some slack,
don't look so terrified.

48
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,833
We're here 'cause I wanna
show you something.

49
00:04:54,916 --> 00:04:57,375
Something I think
you need to see.

50
00:04:57,458 --> 00:05:01,333
Not 'til tomorrow, though.
Today, we start small.

51
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,541
Pretty sweet, right?

52
00:05:12,625 --> 00:05:15,958
Great view to relax by.
Helps clear your head.

53
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:26,500
What do you say?

54
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:29,291
Yeah, I'm not really
feelin' it, man.

55
00:05:29,375 --> 00:05:31,000
You're killin' me Haru.

56
00:05:31,083 --> 00:05:32,750
What happened to the freak
who would strip down

57
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,250
when he got within
twenty feet of water?

58
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:37,250
Give it a rest.

59
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,958
[RIN] Nobody forced you
to get on that plane,

60
00:05:39,041 --> 00:05:40,625
you could've said no any time.

61
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,916
I didn't expect you to come.
What changed your mind?

62
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
[HARUKA]
Nothing.

63
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:48,500
I just don't wanna
be home right now.

64
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,875
You and Makoto had
a falling out, huh?

65
00:05:51,958 --> 00:05:54,708
That's gotta suck, right?

66
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,750
No big. It happens.

67
00:05:56,833 --> 00:06:01,125
Sosuke and me get
into it all the time.

68
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,583
[HARUKA]
Yeah, well.

69
00:06:04,166 --> 00:06:06,291
It was our first fight.

70
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:11,000
[RIN]
Well, there's a silver lining.

71
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:16,041
Makoto finally settled on what
he's gonna do after graduation.

72
00:06:16,125 --> 00:06:21,291
He wants to tell you all
about it once we're back.

73
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:22,750
Man, this is gorgeous.

74
00:06:22,833 --> 00:06:24,916
Really puts it all into
perspective, you know?

75
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,083
At least for me.

76
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:28,041
When I first came here,
back in the day,

77
00:06:28,125 --> 00:06:31,875
if I got stressed out,
the ocean calmed me down.

78
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:38,333
[RIN] I might have talked a big
game before I left Japan, but,

79
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:41,791
I was really just trying
to hide how nervous I was.

80
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:49,875
[RIN]
New place. New people.

81
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:52,833
Talk about a fish out of water.

82
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:56,750
Hi there, Rin.
We're excited to have you.

83
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:00,041
[RUSSELL]
Right then. Hop in.

84
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:01,583
We'll give you a little tour.

85
00:07:01,666 --> 00:07:03,166
[RIN]
I mean, sure, I knew things

86
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:06,041
would be different, but still.

87
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:08,208
[YOUNG RIN panting]

88
00:07:08,291 --> 00:07:10,750
[RIN]
I needed some ocean.

89
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:12,291
It's hard to explain.

90
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:15,791
But as far away from you and
Sosuke and the guys as I was,

91
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:18,583
looking out over
the water, I felt like

92
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,083
it was only a swim
away from home.

93
00:07:24,041 --> 00:07:25,208
[RIN]
Yeah, I know.

94
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,708
Never really talked
that much about

95
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:31,958
the time I spent here. Sometimes
it's tough to think about.

96
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:32,791
[YOUNG RIN]
Good morning!

97
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:34,833
My name is Rin Matsuoka. Hi!

98
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:36,833
You may think my
name sounds weird.

99
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:38,916
Some people tell me
it sounds like a girls'.

100
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,541
But I'm a boy, I promise!

101
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,833
Don't make me prove it!

102
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:45,666
Alrighty.

103
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:48,208
[YOUNG RIN laughs nervously]

104
00:07:48,291 --> 00:07:51,875
[RIN] I went to school while
doing the whole home-stay thing.

105
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,291
One of the sayings
I like to live by is:

106
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,750
"When in Rome..."

107
00:07:55,833 --> 00:07:57,916
[RIN] It was a hell of thing
gettin' past the accents,

108
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,958
let me tell ya.

109
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:04,416
[YOUNG RIN] In Japan, we have
Sakura trees everywhere.

110
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,291
They bloom in Spring.

111
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:09,666
You guys call them
cherry blossoms.

112
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,708
Sa-kura.

113
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:15,041
[RIN] I'd spend all day at
school, then I'd head off

114
00:08:15,125 --> 00:08:17,625
to swimming practice
with my coach.

115
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:20,083
Okay, let's get you...

116
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,625
[RIN]
The team had badass swimmers

117
00:08:21,708 --> 00:08:26,250
from all over the world.
At first, that seemed awesome.

118
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:34,583
[RIN] But I learned pretty
quick that being fast in Japan

119
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:38,708
didn't mean much here.
I hit a wall. Hard.

120
00:08:38,791 --> 00:08:42,083
Had no clue what to do.

121
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:44,250
The more I competed,
the more I saw how far behind

122
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:48,000
I was from the other kids
my age. I felt like a fraud.

123
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:51,583
Who was I to call myself
a swimmer next to those guys?

124
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:53,583
My dream was shot.

125
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:55,833
Dude, stop.

126
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:58,375
You don't gotta spell
it out. I get the idea.

127
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:00,958
You were a scared little kid
in a big, bad foreign country

128
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:02,875
and you felt like a nobody.

129
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:09,750
[RIN] I wanna stop by one more
place before we call it a day.

130
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:12,125
[LORI] You're pulling
my leg! Is that you?

131
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,833
Oh-ho, Rin!

132
00:09:13,916 --> 00:09:15,250
[RUSSELL]
So how you been keeping?

133
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:16,541
Things good back in Japan?

134
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:17,791
[RIN]
Things are great, Russell.

135
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:19,583
Good to see you!

136
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,458
I can't get over
how big you've gotten!

137
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,791
Well, I swim every day,
so, you know.

138
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:24,750
[RUSSELL]
Every day?

139
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,000
That's some dedication!

140
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:28,458
[RIN laughs]
Yep!

141
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,500
[RUSSELL] You and that old mate
of yours still lockin' horns?

142
00:09:30,583 --> 00:09:32,541
[LORI]
Haruka, yeah? Was that his name?

143
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:33,625
Am I remembering it right?

144
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,875
[RUSSELL]
Oh, yeah, Haru.

145
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,083
[LORI]
Wait, is that him over there?

146
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,625
[RIN]
That's him.

147
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,416
[RIN]
C'mon, man! Don't be rude.

148
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,416
Say hello.

149
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,458
Haru, this is my
home-stay family.

150
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:44,458
Meet Russell and Lori!

151
00:09:46,083 --> 00:09:47,708
[HARUKA whispering]
What're you doing? Seriously?

152
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,083
[RUSSELL]
G'day, Haru!

153
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:51,458
Any friend of Rin
is a friend of mine.

154
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:52,875
Wonderful to meet you.

155
00:09:52,958 --> 00:09:55,375
I feel like we already
know each other.

156
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,916
Uh, thanks, ma'am.
That's very nice of you.

157
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,166
Rin's said a lot of cool
things about you guys.

158
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,500
[WINNIE barking]

159
00:10:04,583 --> 00:10:07,833
[RIN] Looks like Winnie's still
a great judge of character.

160
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:12,791
How you liking it in
Australia so far, mate?

161
00:10:12,875 --> 00:10:14,500
Great to have you.

162
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,458
[WINNIE sniffing]

163
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:19,666
[LORI]
Dinner's ready, Haru.

164
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,541
Come join us, please.

165
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:23,750
[LORI]
Help yourself.

166
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,833
'S not rude to stuff
your face here.

167
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,583
Thanks, it looks great.

168
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:32,000
Rin, your friend is just
as you described him.

169
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:35,333
Cool as a cucumber and eyes
that look like the ocean.

170
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,583
Don't embarrass him.

171
00:10:36,666 --> 00:10:37,750
Chill, dude.

172
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:38,916
Don't get a big head,
I was just trying

173
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,333
to paint a picture of home.

174
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:43,833
[RUSSELL] Rin tells us
your thing is freestyle.

175
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:47,833
That true? Nothing else
do it for you? Wow.

176
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:48,958
Yeah. Well, you know.

177
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,041
[RIN laughs]

178
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,208
[HARUKA]
Did you tell these people

179
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,000
my whole life story, or what?

180
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,541
[RIN]
Uh, not really?

181
00:10:54,625 --> 00:10:56,750
[LORI] I don't know if you're
aware of this or not, Haru,

182
00:10:56,833 --> 00:10:58,708
but by the way Rin talked,
I could tell

183
00:10:58,791 --> 00:11:01,291
you're someone he
truly looks up to.

184
00:11:01,375 --> 00:11:03,041
Can we change
the topic, please?

185
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:05,541
Screw that. I wanna
know what you said.

186
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,041
Is it really that important?

187
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,541
Little bit, yeah.

188
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,416
Ugh. What do
you want from me?

189
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,125
I told you this afternoon.

190
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,000
[LORI] We're glad you've done
so well for yourself, Rin.

191
00:11:17,083 --> 00:11:18,625
Had a bit of a cloud
hanging over you

192
00:11:18,708 --> 00:11:21,125
for a while there.

193
00:11:21,208 --> 00:11:25,208
Hold up, you guys
knew about that?

194
00:11:25,291 --> 00:11:29,000
[RUSSELL] You gave it a
brave face, but we could tell.

195
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,166
[LORI] Russell and I talked
about it every night.

196
00:11:31,250 --> 00:11:33,625
We realized it was hard on
you here, so we did our best

197
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:36,125
to make you feel at home.
We wanted to give you

198
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,125
a house full of laughter,
good food,

199
00:11:38,208 --> 00:11:40,625
warm memories and all that.
Didn't want whatever

200
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,750
was going on at school
to spoil Australia for you.

201
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,875
I never meant to make you worry.

202
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:50,500
Sorry.

203
00:11:50,583 --> 00:11:52,416
Now we can have
that change of topic.

204
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,708
Eat up, boys.

205
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:55,291
You haven't touched
a thing, Haru.

206
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:56,625
The mackerel's delish.

207
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,416
Rin told me you
were crazy about it.

208
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,666
Aren't you hungry?

209
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,083
Uh, yes.

210
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:04,416
[RUSSELL] So mate, got
a girlfriend back home?

211
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:08,458
[RIN] Mm... Long story.
Or not, actually.

212
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:11,083
[RUSSELL laughing]
I'll take that as a no.

213
00:12:11,166 --> 00:12:13,125
It's all right,
I was late bloomer, too.

214
00:12:13,208 --> 00:12:15,708
[LORI laughs] Remember that
little girl with the--

215
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,333
[RIN] Oh, don't go
there, Lori. Please.

216
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:21,083
[RUSSELL laughs]
It's summer back home

217
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,166
for you right now, yeah?

218
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:23,291
[RIN]
Right.

219
00:12:23,375 --> 00:12:24,375
[LORI] Does it get
very hot over there?

220
00:12:24,458 --> 00:12:27,000
[RIN]
Ugh. It's like a blast furnace.

221
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:32,125
Well, mates. Take care.

222
00:12:32,208 --> 00:12:34,041
Lori and I had a
great time seeing ya.

223
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,416
Be well, come back and
visit whenever you like.

224
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,541
[RIN]
I'll keep in touch, all right?

225
00:12:37,625 --> 00:12:39,041
[RUSSELL]
Hey, enjoy the posh digs.

226
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:40,125
[RIN]
Thanks, guys.

227
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,375
This was really great.
'Til next time!

228
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:50,166
[RIN]
Got something on your mind?

229
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,583
[HARUKA]
Do what? No.

230
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,625
No I'm good.

231
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,833
[RIN]
Cool. Let's get checked in.

232
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,583
[RIN]
Hi there.

233
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,416
We have a reservation for
tonight under Matsuoka.

234
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:03,458
First name Rin.

235
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:04,791
[FEMALE CLERK 12A]
ID, please?

236
00:13:04,875 --> 00:13:06,625
[RIN]
Hey, give me your passport.

237
00:13:06,708 --> 00:13:08,458
[FEMALE CLERK 12A] Okay, just
fill out your name, address,

238
00:13:08,541 --> 00:13:11,583
passport info. And I
need a signature there.

239
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,250
[RIN]
What?!

240
00:13:30,333 --> 00:13:33,416
There'd better be
a cot, damn it.

241
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:36,333
Uh, did we get screwed or is
this normal for Australia?

242
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,083
[RIN]
We got screwed! I blame you.

243
00:13:39,166 --> 00:13:41,958
You and that stupid
girl-sounding name.

244
00:13:42,041 --> 00:13:43,833
What about yours, sweetheart?

245
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,041
Huh? Shut your face!

246
00:13:46,125 --> 00:13:46,916
Make me!

247
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:47,791
Shut up!

248
00:13:47,875 --> 00:13:49,083
Make me!

249
00:13:49,166 --> 00:13:51,375
Your name confuses--
You know what? Never mind.

250
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,250
I don't have time for this crap.

251
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,750
I'm gonna talk
to the front desk.

252
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:57,166
[FEMALE CLERK 12A]
Oh, I'm sorry, there's nothing

253
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,541
we can do about it now.

254
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:01,250
Look, I promise you,
it's not a complicated issue.

255
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,541
Just switch us to another
room with two beds.

256
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:04,958
Sir, we're full for the night.

257
00:14:05,041 --> 00:14:07,750
You and your friend are welcome
to find rooms elsewhere.

258
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:11,416
But I warn you, a ten percent
cancellation fee will apply.

259
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,666
[RIN]
Ugh. This is ridiculous.

260
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,458
I mean, it's your screw-up!

261
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:18,000
Sir, our policy
regarding cancellations

262
00:14:18,083 --> 00:14:19,416
is quite clear.

263
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,291
I suggest you read the online
agreement more closely.

264
00:14:29,833 --> 00:14:31,500
Unbelievable.

265
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:34,750
[HARUKA] Would you stop?
Just go to sleep.

266
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:38,166
Ugh. Good night, I guess.

267
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,583
[RIN]
Hey, Haru?

268
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:03,625
What I told Lori and Russell
back in the day was true.

269
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,708
You probably don't remember
the first time we met,

270
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,708
but to me, it might as well
have been yesterday.

271
00:15:08,791 --> 00:15:10,583
It's that vivid.

272
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:14,708
[RIN] At that point in my life,
it never occurred to me

273
00:15:14,791 --> 00:15:17,666
that someone could be
faster than I was.

274
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:21,250
[RIN]
I was pissed off at first, sure.

275
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,916
But then I thought, "Wow.

276
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,500
There's someone out there
who can teach me something.

277
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:29,000
I want to swim like this guy."

278
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:31,375
That's why when you're not
out there ahead of me blazin'

279
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:36,041
a trail, I feel kinda lost,
like I can't get my bearings.

280
00:15:36,125 --> 00:15:40,750
It's 'cause of you that
I found out who I really was.

281
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:42,208
[HARUKA]
I do remember.

282
00:15:42,291 --> 00:15:44,083
That was a crazy tournament.

283
00:15:46,541 --> 00:15:48,291
What about that
last freestyle race?

284
00:15:48,375 --> 00:15:50,416
Back in the spring?

285
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:53,708
Felt pretty good setting
a new record together.

286
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:56,041
Sure.

287
00:15:56,125 --> 00:16:00,958
[RIN] Don't take this the wrong
way, but I was testing you.

288
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,291
Felt like I had to.

289
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:06,708
I needed to see how
far you could go.

290
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,541
Man, when I felt you
closing the gap between us,

291
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:12,708
I knew. There was
no doubt in my mind.

292
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:14,250
You were in the
same league as me.

293
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,458
Post-graduation, the world
would be our oyster.

294
00:16:17,541 --> 00:16:19,750
C'mon. You can't tell me
you didn't feel it, too.

295
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:22,416
The future was wide open.

296
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,750
[RIN] I know you
think all your dreams

297
00:17:00,833 --> 00:17:03,375
are basically somebody else's.
But here's the question:

298
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:07,041
what makes a dream
really and truly yours?

299
00:17:57,041 --> 00:17:59,083
Well, here we are.

300
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:00,458
[HARUKA]
What is this?

301
00:18:00,541 --> 00:18:03,541
[RIN] A place that separates
the men from the boys.

302
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,291
Let's do it.

303
00:18:12,666 --> 00:18:14,291
[RIN]
Yo. Over here.

304
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,833
[RIN]
Take it in, dude.

305
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:20,541
This is where the best
swimmers in the world

306
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,458
test their metal
against each other.

307
00:18:22,541 --> 00:18:27,375
This is what I flew you
all the way here to see.

308
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,416
Well, not just see.

309
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,958
It's cool for us to swim?

310
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:33,833
As long as you've got the heart,
this is anybody's lap pool.

311
00:18:33,916 --> 00:18:35,958
Um, I didn't bring a swimsuit.

312
00:18:36,041 --> 00:18:39,041
I got you covered. Come on.

313
00:18:48,583 --> 00:18:50,708
[RIN]
Hey, it's the National Team!

314
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:52,250
[HARUKA]
No kidding?

315
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:54,166
[RIN] Yeah, this is
where they practice.

316
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,291
You really sure it's okay
for us to be here?

317
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:57,333
I...

318
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,333
I mean, no one
else's in the pool.

319
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,666
Well, there's this one and
the practice pool over there.

320
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,875
No problem using it if
you don't feel comfortable

321
00:19:03,958 --> 00:19:06,958
swimmin' next to
the National Team.

322
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:08,708
Your call, dude.

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,791
[MALE SWIMMER 12B]
Hey. Hello.

324
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:52,958
Wanna race? Then, let's go!

325
00:19:53,041 --> 00:20:08,000
[CROWD cheering]

326
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:11,500
[HARUKA gasps]

327
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:15,625
[HARUKA]
This is it.

328
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,958
[HARUKA]
This is what I want.

329
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:39,958
Right here...

330
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,208
[CROWD cheers]

331
00:20:42,291 --> 00:20:44,750
[HARUKA]
This is my dream...

332
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:51,666
[RIN]
Hey.

333
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,208
You wanna watch
or you wanna swim?

334
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,125
[HARUKA]
Swim.

335
00:21:10,375 --> 00:21:11,791
A few weeks ago,

336
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,833
I got a letter from the coach
I told you I trained under

337
00:21:13,916 --> 00:21:15,333
while I was here.

338
00:21:15,416 --> 00:21:18,708
He asked if I'd ever
consider coming back.

339
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,541
Showing you my old haunts
isn't the only reason we came.

340
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,625
I'm gonna ask if he's giving
me a formal invitation

341
00:21:23,708 --> 00:21:25,083
to join the team.

342
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,208
It's been a long time comin'
with a hell of detour

343
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:30,541
along the way, but Australia
was always the end game for me.

344
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:32,708
I need to put it to rest.

345
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,208
It's payback time.

346
00:21:35,291 --> 00:21:36,958
My dream.

347
00:21:38,916 --> 00:21:42,708
I've found it. It's mine.

348
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:24,000
[MAKOTO] Man, we have
so many memories together.

349
00:23:24,083 --> 00:23:26,083
[NAGISA]
Hey, it's okay. They're ours.

350
00:23:26,166 --> 00:23:27,416
[REI]
Exactly.

351
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:29,208
And more's the point,
they pave the way forward.

352
00:23:29,291 --> 00:23:33,166
[RIN] Memories are the
building blocks of the future.

353
00:23:33,250 --> 00:23:34,208
[MAKOTO, HARUKA, NAGISA,
REI, RIN] Next time:

354
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,875
"Eternal Summer of Beginnings."

355
00:23:36,958 --> 00:23:39,250
[HARUKA] This is our
last time to swim together.

356
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:40,875
Make it count.
