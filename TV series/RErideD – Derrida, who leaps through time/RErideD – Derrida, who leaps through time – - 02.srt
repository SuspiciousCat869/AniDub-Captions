Then I've got no choice...

13
00:03:43,916 --> 00:03:46,375
[DERRIDA]
What the hell is going on here?

Please tell me, when is this?

[VIDAUX]
Who really gives a crap?

18
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,458
It's winter all
year 'round, anyway.

[DERRIDA] What the...?
Hey, what year is it?

20
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:00,916
[VIDAUX]
2060.

21
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,541
Hmm, wrong one.

22
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:06,041
That means that I've traveled
10 years into the future?

23
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,208
I was... framed.
Someone set us up!

24
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,000
I was driving away with Nathan,
and then after that...

25
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:14,291
That's right! I fell into
a cryostasis chamber!

26
00:04:15,416 --> 00:04:18,125
Huh? Cryostasis?

27
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,375
They outlawed that
procedure back in the day

28
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:22,833
'cause of constant malfunctions.

29
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,333
What happened here?

30
00:04:27,125 --> 00:04:29,666
[VIDAUX]
Obvious, ain't it? A war.

31
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,500
There's no way...

32
00:04:34,916 --> 00:04:36,208
[VIDAUX]
Believe it.

33
00:04:36,291 --> 00:04:38,833
And it's all thanks to these
damn puppet soldiers.

[MAN]
Early in the war,

36
00:04:41,375 --> 00:04:44,041
these mindless hunks of
junk were all the rage.

37
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,750
The latest weapon.

38
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,500
The men who made them
got filthy rich.

39
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:51,375
Wish I could see
the bastards' faces.

a guy like you won't
even make it 100 meters.

44
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:05,875
If I offer you protection
and transport to somewhere safe,

45
00:05:05,958 --> 00:05:07,875
how much will you pay?

46

[DERRIDA]
Hey, the other ones are coming!

47

Too rich for your blood?

That's the price of your life.

[VIDAUX]
What? That's impossible.

74
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,625
[GRAHAM] Perhaps it is
an older model of chip.

75

on the side, Mayuka.

Yes, perfect.

103

The eighth wave of

No, no, no! Certainly not!

a bit of restraint

when it comes to that,
my friend.

Maintaining a balance of power

110
00:09:06,625 --> 00:09:09,458
is the key to everything
in this game, after all.

111

Oh, no, not that!

112
00:09:10,916 --> 00:09:13,041
That's a different
matter entirely!

got me there, I suppose!

Very good!
Well, see you later!

116

stuff's aggravating.

117
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:25,708
I'm fed up with
this nonsense already!

118
00:09:25,791 --> 00:09:27,458
Oh, look at the time,
didn't even notice.

119
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:30,000
I'm going to be late to the
party if I don't hurry.

120
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:31,791
Lily! My things.

121
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:33,333
[LILY]
Certainly.

122
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,750
[DZ] Sir, there is a matter
requiring your action.

123
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,791
Oh, Marie. Please, not now.

124
00:09:38,875 --> 00:09:40,250
Shoo. I'm running quite behind,

125
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,250
and there's nothing
more important than a party.

126
00:09:42,333 --> 00:09:45,166
[MARIE] I'm afraid it's of
prime importance, sir.

127
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,625
Listen here.
There's nothing in that

128
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:49,416
two-bit robot brain of yours
that could possibly be...

[gasp]

130
00:09:50,916 --> 00:09:52,041
[MARIE]
Derrida Yvain.

131
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,333
His life signature was
detected yesterday.

132
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,250
[ANDREI]
Impossible. He should be...

133
00:09:58,333 --> 00:10:03,958
[gasp] No, there's no way!
Derrida is still alive?!

134
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:06,750
But no one has seen or heard
from him in 10 years!

135
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:10,125
That man is supposed to be dead!

136
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,958
[MAYUKA]
I'm starving.

137
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,875
Sorry. I'm flat broke.

138
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,500
Stop sulking.

139
00:10:32,458 --> 00:10:36,291
[DERRIDA] I don't get it.
What's going on here?

140
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,708
[MAYUKA]
Dinner, Papa.

141
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:44,333
[VIDAUX] Thing is, I've got a
set of rules and regulations

142
00:10:44,416 --> 00:10:45,666
I follow to the letter.

143
00:10:45,750 --> 00:10:48,083
I'll take any job for
decent compensation,

144
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,875
but I don't stick my neck
out for free for anyone.

145
00:10:51,958 --> 00:10:54,333
Still, if some wretch is
about to die from hunger,

146
00:10:54,416 --> 00:10:56,416
I'll feed him, at least.

147
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,750
[MAYUKA]
Here.

148
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,333
I can't have you
starving to death

149
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,458
before I manage to get
something out of it.

150
00:11:02,541 --> 00:11:05,166
You must have some
possessions in the city.

151
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:08,000
[DERRIDA]
No. I don't think I do.

152
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,375
When somebody dies,

153
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,875
what happens to all
their money? Where's it go?

154
00:11:11,958 --> 00:11:14,750
If they have no next of kin,
the government takes it.

155
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:18,750
So, kid, what the hell
did you do, anyway?

156
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,416
It wasn't me.

157
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:34,125
It wasn't! I didn't kill Nathan!
I was set up, I swear!

158
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:36,833
The DZs. They had already been
delivered to the military.

159
00:11:36,916 --> 00:11:39,000
And that snake Andrei,
he tricked us!

160

317
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:36,291
Get rid of him without
anyone finding out.

318
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:39,333
Quietly. Precisely.

319
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:43,208
You got that? Donna?

My pay.

00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,791
Lily, come here!

323
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,250
Go and fetch the
card from the desk,

324
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:52,625
and give it to this woman,

325
00:20:52,708 --> 00:20:55,541
then delete this entire
interaction from the record.

326
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,250
Target and reward.

327
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,250
Those are the only
things I require.

328

[growls]
Damn you!

329
00:21:03,875 --> 00:21:05,333
Who do you think's
in charge here--

00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:09,500

I will erase him.

00:21:26,333 --> 00:21:28,666
That was a warning shot.

[DERRIDA]
Wait! It's me! It's Derrida!

What?

That can't... Derrida is...

341
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:43,291
[DERRIDA] Yuri, I was frozen
in cryostasis for 10 years.

342
00:21:43,375 --> 00:21:46,208
[YURI] Oh, sure.
You expect me to believe that?

343
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,500
Listen to me. Where's Mage?
Is she safe somewhere?

344
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:51,875
Just tell me, please!

345
00:21:51,958 --> 00:21:53,500
I'm sorry.

346
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,000
Mage is dead.

No...

349
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,250
[DONNA]
She can't be...
