We have a duty here at Rebuild.

In the seven years since

the first Automata
went on the market,

48
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,583
human society has
come to rely heavily

49
00:03:11,666 --> 00:03:14,916
on the autonomous robots
that our company provides.

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,708
And we've had almost
zero recalls in that time.

there's a chance
that they'd go haywire

[MRS. HUDSON]
Yes, miss.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,708
[DERRIDA]
Hm? Hold on.

165
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:15,625
We don't have
a fish pie this year?

166
00:08:15,708 --> 00:08:18,875
No. Couldn't get my hands
on one, unfortunately.

167
00:08:18,958 --> 00:08:22,000
[MAGE]
It's because of... the war.

168
00:08:22,083 --> 00:08:26,000
[NEWSCASTER] However, things now
appear to be reversing course.

169
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,458
Late last night, the fighting

170
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:30,416
seemed to have
escalated once more.

171
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,000
According to reports at the--

That's enough.

No sad news allowed today.

175
00:08:37,291 --> 00:08:38,666
[NATHAN]
Hmm.

176
00:08:40,916 --> 00:08:42,541
Just for a little longer.

177
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,791
Soon, everything will
go back to normal.

178
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,916
I hope so.

It'll be a whole new year!

[MAGE]
Wait, let me walk you home.

195
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:26,166
Big Sis, it's so cold,
you don't have to!

196

No, it's okay. Huh?

[MRS. HUDSON]
Shall we be on our way?

200
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:36,708
[NATHAN]
Here you go.

201
00:09:36,791 --> 00:09:37,708
This could've gotten me into

202
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,625
a lot of trouble
back in the day.

203
00:09:39,708 --> 00:09:42,291
One more use for Automata.

204
00:09:42,375 --> 00:09:44,375
A toast, to our deus ex machina.

205
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,666
Let's not forget that
it's Mage's birthday!

206
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,541
Fair enough.

207
00:09:48,625 --> 00:09:50,375
To today, a special day.

208
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,166
[DERRIDA]
A special day.

209
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:55,500
And then, tomorrow will
be a special day, too.

210
00:09:55,583 --> 00:09:56,583
Huh?

211
00:09:56,666 --> 00:09:57,833
[NATHAN]
Once we finish fixing that bug,

212
00:09:57,916 --> 00:09:59,958
the DZs will be complete.

213
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,958
Your family dream
will finally be realized.

214
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,750
You mean my father's dream.

215
00:10:04,833 --> 00:10:06,958
I just made myself useful.

216
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:09,166
Tomorrow,
when everything's settled,

217
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,791
let me take you guys
out for a drink.

218
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:12,541
A drink with my old man?

219
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:14,458
Can't even imagine.

220
00:10:14,541 --> 00:10:15,833
[NATHAN]
Listen, Derrida.

221
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:18,500
When this is done, will you
join me in my research?

222
00:10:18,583 --> 00:10:21,208
Huh?

223
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,958
You mean the time jump?

224
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,625
[sighs] It's been a long road,
but it's nearly complete.

225
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,708
If I can just work out
the last few kinks--

226
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,166
[DERRIDA]
That old joke again?

227
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,041
I have to hear it tonight,
of all nights? Please.

228
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,291
[NATHAN]
I'm serious!

229
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,833
Your theory inspired me
in the first place!

230
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:39,083
[DERRIDA]
More like my pipe dream.

231
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,958
It was always going
to be impossible.

232
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,416
No, that isn't true!

233
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,708
Those stupid experiments
were not harmless,

234
00:10:44,791 --> 00:10:46,625
they cost me a part of
my childhood memories

235
00:10:46,708 --> 00:10:48,083
I can never get back.

236
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:51,208
Nathan, why are you so
obsessed with time riding?

237
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,500
Because it's my mission
as a scientist.

238
00:10:53,583 --> 00:10:55,250
Getting labeled
a fringe scientist

239
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:57,083
won't help you in the long run.

240
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,208
[NATHAN]
You think it's fringe science?

241
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,458
[DERRIDA]
What I think is that

242
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:02,500
you should focus on
plausible subjects

243
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:06,166
and build a career before
you go there. Be realistic.

244
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,666
Be realistic?!

245
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,375
Like those executives?!

246
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:12,375
Forget my work and just focus
on how much money I can make?

247
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:17,083
[grunts]

248
00:11:17,166 --> 00:11:19,708
--[NATHAN] I'm sorry.
--[DERRIDA] It's okay.

249
00:11:19,791 --> 00:11:21,875
The brandy was too strong,
that's all.

250
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:23,666
I should get going anyway.

251
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:30,375
[sigh]
Oh... Mage?

252
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:35,958
Hey, show me where you're
gonna plant those tuberoses.

253
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:38,750
[chuckles]

254
00:11:38,833 --> 00:11:40,208
[MAGE]
This way!

255
00:11:40,291 --> 00:11:43,750
When it warms up,
I wanna plant 'em right here!

256
00:11:43,833 --> 00:11:46,041
I can't wait to see how
it'll look in the spring.

257
00:11:46,125 --> 00:11:47,208
[MAGE]
Hey, Derrida.

258
00:11:47,291 --> 00:11:48,375
Huh?

259
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:56,208
Why won't you help my
dad with his research?

260
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,500
With the time ride?

261
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,750
Humans jumping through time
like that is just a fantasy.

262
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:05,208
It's not... possible.

263
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,500
[MAGE] What is the key to
traveling through time?

264
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:11,416
To memories that
can't be erased.

265
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,333
To special times and places.

266
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:15,541
Why do humans...

267
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,250
...long to return to moments

268
00:12:17,333 --> 00:12:20,375
they've randomly
designated as special?

269
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,583
Wait, Mage?

270
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,166
[DERRIDA chuckles]
You're amazing.

271
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:26,625
Not really. I'm quoting
your thesis, that's all.

272
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:30,875
Dad completely believes in
the theory that you proposed.

273
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:32,375
And so do I.

274
00:12:32,458 --> 00:12:34,375
[DERRIDA]
Mage, you have to understand.

275
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:36,708
I was swept away
by my fantasies.

276
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,666
Maybe I just wanted to
prove that romantic idea

277
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:42,833
that the missing key
to the impossible

278
00:12:42,916 --> 00:12:44,916
is just wishing and hoping
and praying harder

279
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,250
than anyone has before you.

280
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:50,541
It's a wonderful thought!
You should prove it!

281
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:52,666
Like the first people
to ever fly,

282
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:56,166
or the ones who first explored
the depths of the ocean!

283
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,958
[DERRIDA] People have made
all kinds of dreams come true.

284
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,541
[MAGE]
Then so can you!

285
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:03,625
But after centuries of repeated
study and experiments,

286
00:13:03,708 --> 00:13:05,250
one thing is clear.

287
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:06,833
We can't time travel.

288
00:13:06,916 --> 00:13:09,541
But there's still a chance that
you could make the breakthrough!

289
00:13:09,625 --> 00:13:13,250
Unrealized possibilities are
no different than dreams,

290
00:13:13,333 --> 00:13:16,416
and I've awakened
from all of mine.

291
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,958
[DERRIDA] Hmph. I can't believe
I'm talking to you about this.

292
00:13:22,666 --> 00:13:23,750
Uh?

293
00:13:23,833 --> 00:13:25,958
Sorry. Would you give
this to your dad?

294
00:13:29,833 --> 00:13:33,083
Please. Derrida. Work with him.

295
00:13:33,166 --> 00:13:35,041
[DERRIDA]
Yeah. I will soon.

296
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:36,541
Really?

297
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,583
Sure, but now I'm gonna get
home before I freeze, okay?

298
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:41,041
[MAGE]
Do you mean it, Derrida?

299
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,166
[DERRIDA]
Good night, Mage.

300
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,000
Will you?!

301
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:48,958
If I wish hard enough?

302
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,666
[COMPUTER] Appointment with
Jacques Yvain confirmed.

303
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:02,458
Meeting site designated.

304
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:04,583
Finally.

305
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:05,875
[DERRIDA]
Dad?

306
00:14:05,958 --> 00:14:08,041
[JACQUES]
It's been a while, Derrida.

307
00:14:08,125 --> 00:14:09,833
When did you identify the issue?

308
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,291
[DERRIDA]
Four days ago.

309
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:12,333
[JACQUES]
Impressive.

310
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,541
--Swift work.
--Whatever.

311
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,041
Take this.

312
00:14:19,083 --> 00:14:20,833
[DERRIDA] To keep the
program from being located,

313
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,708
I split it up around the cloud,
then Atmosed it.

314
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:26,000
Even on the off-chance
that someone finds it,

315
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:28,625
it can't be accessed
without that physical key.

316
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,125
I don't necessarily believe
the rumors going around

317
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,416
about DZs being weaponized,

318
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,750
but I can't let it go

319
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,083
if there's a chance
they could be dangerous.

320
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:40,166
