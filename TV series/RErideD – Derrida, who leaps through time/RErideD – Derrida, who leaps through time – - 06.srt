[DERRIDA]
That's...

00:00:17,192 --> 00:00:18,733
[DERRIDA]
Cassiel.

4
00:02:02,733 --> 00:02:03,983
[DERRIDA]
Cassiel became a Destruct?

00:02:04,067 --> 00:02:06,192
--[MAYUKA] And this. And...
--Why?

He's a researcher,
just doesn't make sense.

If you wanna know so badly,

9
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:15,067
why don't you track down the
guy and ask him yourself?

10
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:17,233
[YURI] Do we even know
where he is right now?

11
00:02:17,317 --> 00:02:19,025
[VIDAUX]
Garbond, looks like.

12
00:02:19,108 --> 00:02:20,608
[YURI]
That's pretty far.

13
00:02:20,692 --> 00:02:22,150
[MAYUKA]
How about this?

14
00:02:22,233 --> 00:02:24,067
Oh, perfect!

15
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:25,900
Tell me!

16
00:02:25,983 --> 00:02:28,525
Uh, right, yeah.

17
00:02:28,608 --> 00:02:30,150
Tell what?

18
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:32,275
Well, Derrida asked
her for a favor.

19
00:02:32,358 --> 00:02:34,317
To keep an eye out for something
he could take notes with,

20
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,650
so he can do an experiment.

21
00:02:36,733 --> 00:02:37,983
[MAYUKA]
And I found that!

22
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:39,942
So now you need
to keep your promise

23
00:02:40,025 --> 00:02:42,525
and tell me what
your experiment is.

24
00:02:42,608 --> 00:02:45,858
Yeah, you do need
to keep your promises.

25
00:02:45,942 --> 00:02:48,442
"Traveling backwards in time."

26
00:02:48,525 --> 00:02:51,692
If I told you it was possible,
would you believe me?

27
00:02:51,775 --> 00:02:52,942
Yeah!

28
00:02:55,233 --> 00:02:57,733
[DERRIDA] A "time ride" is a way
of traveling back in time

29
00:02:57,817 --> 00:02:59,358
that involves sending
your consciousness

30
00:02:59,442 --> 00:03:01,067
into the body
of your past self.

31
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:03,858
It's based on a hypothesis
known as the Trout Theory.

32
00:03:03,942 --> 00:03:05,817
Oh, I've read about that before.

33
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:07,358
It was in that one book.

34
00:03:07,442 --> 00:03:10,233
But I don't remember
what it was called.

35
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,733
Mayuka, just give it to him.

36
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,025
He can explain this
nonsense in the car.

37
00:03:15,108 --> 00:03:16,483
[MAYUKA]
Okay.

38
00:03:20,983 --> 00:03:22,900
[YURI]
Derrida.

39
00:03:22,983 --> 00:03:25,192
Going back into the body
of your past self,

40
00:03:25,275 --> 00:03:27,358
what would that accomplish?

41
00:03:27,442 --> 00:03:30,400
If I could only redo
that day ten years ago,

42
00:03:30,483 --> 00:03:32,067
knowing what I do now,

43
00:03:32,150 --> 00:03:35,317
maybe I could save my
father and Nathan, too.

44
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:37,483
If I hadn't left that
access key with Mage,

45
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:40,608
then maybe she'd be safe instead
of being a target right now.

46
00:03:40,692 --> 00:03:43,483
It was my stupid decision
that put her in danger.

47
00:03:50,775 --> 00:03:51,942

Poor Graham, are you okay?

52
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:10,525
[GRAHAM] It would be unwise
to drive under these conditions.

53
00:04:10,608 --> 00:04:13,900
I recommend a diagnostic
by a specialized mechanic.

[MAYUKA grunts]

55
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,108

We should find a mechanic

56
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:26,233
in the city just
a little ways off.

57
00:04:26,317 --> 00:04:29,108
All the circuits in that block
are dead, so if we want help,

58
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:31,567
we'll have to bring
someone back this way.

59
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:35,025
So, do Derrida and Yuri
gotta stay here?

00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,733
This time, it seems so.

Don't just stand by the road.

62
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:42,650
Find somewhere to hide.

How long will this take?

Probably all night.

00:04:45,442 --> 00:04:46,775
Not ideal.

66
00:04:46,858 --> 00:04:49,608
[VIDAUX sighs]
No choice.

67
00:04:49,692 --> 00:04:50,567
See ya.

68
00:05:03,192 --> 00:05:04,983
Anybody here?

69
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,483
It's definitely far
from the road.

70
00:05:11,567 --> 00:05:13,108
We should be safe.

Mm. Huh?

Is that a photo of flowers?

00:05:24,108 --> 00:05:26,483
Mage loved these too.

Did she?

You wouldn't expect it,

I thought you were acting weird.

88
00:06:15,442 --> 00:06:16,983
So you're saying
that you traveled back

89
00:06:17,067 --> 00:06:18,483
into your own past

90
00:06:18,567 --> 00:06:21,400
and you were able
to talk to your father?

Hard to believe.

92

It's true, though.

93
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:30,900
But... time rides should require
specific equipment to work.

I don't know what's going on.

95
00:06:33,567 --> 00:06:35,483
About the Trout Theory.

96
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,275
That's the thesis
you presented, right?

97
00:06:38,358 --> 00:06:40,067
How did you know that?

98
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,567
[YURI]
Mage told me about it.

99
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:45,900
She said that your
theory was correct.

100
00:06:45,983 --> 00:06:47,900
That so?

101
00:06:49,025 --> 00:06:53,192
Derrida... we need to talk.

102
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:55,525

Um... can you really do it over?

The stuff that happened
a decade ago.

105
00:07:01,108 --> 00:07:03,192
[DERRIDA] The time ride
is a phenomenon

106
00:07:03,275 --> 00:07:05,858
that requires vividly recalling
certain memories.

Hmm.

108

you said you did
your first time ride.

This is from the day
that we infiltrated Rebuild.

are what trigger it.

00:09:49,233 --> 00:09:52,108
But that was already
too late to do something.

165
00:09:52,192 --> 00:09:53,900
I need to go further back.

166
00:09:53,983 --> 00:09:55,650
[engine humming]

167
00:09:59,442 --> 00:10:03,192
[MAYUKA] Papa! Do you ever
want to go back to long ago?

168
00:10:03,275 --> 00:10:04,483
What?

169
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:06,108
What Derrida said.

170
00:10:06,192 --> 00:10:10,400
You can go back into your
old self and do things over?

171
00:10:10,483 --> 00:10:13,400
Nothing in the past
can be done over.

172
00:10:13,483 --> 00:10:15,942
[MAYUKA]
Huh? What'd you say?

173
00:10:19,025 --> 00:10:20,025
[DERRIDA]
What? Mage, no!

174
00:10:20,108 --> 00:10:21,733
[clock ticking slowly]

175
00:10:21,817 --> 00:10:24,400
[NATHAN]
It's nothing too serious.

176
00:10:24,483 --> 00:10:27,400
She's in stable
condition for now.

177
00:10:27,483 --> 00:10:28,775
[DERRIDA]
I suspect that when I try

178
00:10:28,858 --> 00:10:30,608
to make drastic changes,

179
00:10:30,692 --> 00:10:34,442
history's self-correction effect
drags me back to my time.

180
00:10:34,525 --> 00:10:36,483
So how far can I push?

181
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:39,067
[NATHAN] But I was planning
to cancel everything for the day

182
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:40,525
to stay with her, anyway.

183
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:43,025
[DERRIDA]
This will be fine.

184
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:47,442
[NATHAN]
Derrida, are you still there?

185
00:10:47,525 --> 00:10:49,150
Yeah, I'm sorry.

186
00:10:49,233 --> 00:10:52,233
When she wakes up,
tell her get well soon.

187

[DERRIDA]
All right, stay casual.

188
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,983
By the way, about Andrei.

Tomorrow will be too late!

192
00:11:04,317 --> 00:11:06,983

So, what happened to Mage?

Damn it! I have no practical
way of figuring out

196
00:11:14,942 --> 00:11:16,192
if I change anything!

197
00:11:16,275 --> 00:11:18,192
Even if I can go back
to the exact point I want,

198
00:11:18,275 --> 00:11:20,567
it's meaningless
if I can't change it.

199
00:11:20,650 --> 00:11:23,025
Concentrate. Think it through.

His death occurred on
December 21st in the year 2050.

State your answer.

Please, I need
to hear you say it.

but yeah, your father
died that day.

00:12:39,233 --> 00:12:41,900
And Nathan Bilstein
did as well?

[YURI]
Yes.

228
00:12:45,108 --> 00:12:49,275
[DERRIDA] And... Mage Bilstein
is currently missing?

Mm.

If I succeed in changing things,
this conversation will change,

notes will be rewritten.

[YURI] Do you really think
it'll work like that?

I don't know, but it
seems worth testing.

Okay, it's the morning
of Mage's birthday.

Too bad I couldn't go back
any further in time.

The access keys.

This is all pointless

Hmm?

I'd originally intended
to do these time ride

what it is you're doing.

it's something important.

it's even happening.

324
00:18:21,233 --> 00:18:23,608
I'm sure it's only because
he's so focused on work.

325
00:18:23,692 --> 00:18:25,358
Don't let him off easy!

326
00:18:25,442 --> 00:18:29,483
Hey, what kind of present
do you think he got you?

327
00:18:29,567 --> 00:18:31,650
[MAGE]
I'd be happy with anything.

328
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:34,817
[YURI] That's not what
I asked! You have to guess!

329
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:37,525
[MAGE] Then what if
I guess what he'll say?

330
00:18:37,608 --> 00:18:39,067
[YURI]
Oh? Sure, go for it!

331
00:18:39,150 --> 00:18:40,775
[MAGE]
When he gives me the present,

332
00:18:40,858 --> 00:18:43,192
--[YURI] Mm-hm!
--Derrida will definitely...

333
00:18:43,275 --> 00:18:45,525

...say something pretentious!

[BOTH laugh]

335
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:50,150
That's all the proof
that I need.

336
00:18:50,233 --> 00:18:52,483
We really are two of a kind,
aren't we, Yuri?

337
00:18:52,567 --> 00:18:53,900
[YURI]
Mm.

338
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:57,525
It's freezing out here.
We should go and wait inside.

339
00:19:01,817 --> 00:19:04,400
I hope Derrida doesn't
take much longer.

340
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:05,858
Huh?

341
00:19:09,358 --> 00:19:11,525
[DERRIDA]
Okay, first. Nathan's car!

No good.

346
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:28,108
Of course. It's common sense.

347
00:19:28,192 --> 00:19:30,358
When my actions change,
the actions of the people

348
00:19:30,442 --> 00:19:33,567
in the places I would have been
will end up changing, too.

349
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:35,525
Because I was late
to the birthday party,

350
00:19:35,608 --> 00:19:37,983
Mage and Yuri waited for me.

351
00:19:46,442 --> 00:19:49,567
[YURI] I hope Derrida
doesn't take much longer.

352
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:56,608
Good night, Yuri.

00:20:23,775 --> 00:20:25,817
I'm relieved that I told you.

00:20:45,192 --> 00:20:47,858
[YURI]
You're wrong, Derrida.

357
00:20:49,858 --> 00:20:52,233
[MAGE]
Yuri, did you open this file

358
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,650
while I was gone,
by any chance?

359
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:59,983
I'm sorry for not asking.
I thought it was mine.

360
00:21:01,817 --> 00:21:02,983
Mage?

361
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:06,650
[chuckles]
Oh, it's nothing.

362
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,025
It's not your fault those
people are after her.

363
00:21:12,108 --> 00:21:14,525
You don't get it.

364
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,233
It's mine.

365
00:21:16,317 --> 00:21:17,650
And yet, I...

366
00:21:17,733 --> 00:21:19,983
This is just unfair, isn't it?

Stay very still.

00:21:31,275 --> 00:21:34,442
Make one false move and I shoot.

Papa! I found Derrida!

[DERRIDA]
What happened?

377
00:22:00,317 --> 00:22:02,567
Where's Yuri?
