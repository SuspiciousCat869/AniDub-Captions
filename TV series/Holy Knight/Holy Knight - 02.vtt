WEBVTT

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:32.465
Now descendant of Romuald,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:39.572
Shinta Mizumara. To revive the order of the strigoi you must become one with me.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:08.601
Are you sure, Miss Kishimoto?

00:01:20.947 --> 00:01:22.916
Okay. Okay.

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:23.817
What am I supposed to do next?

00:01:32.926 --> 00:01:33.760
[Nervous whimper]

00:01:35.228 --> 00:01:36.663
Miss... Miss Kishimoto.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.402
Where the hell have you been!?

00:01:44.304 --> 00:01:45.672
[Pained gasp]

00:01:45.672 --> 00:01:47.674
You are late.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:48.508
Do you know how long I've been waiting?

00:01:50.677 --> 00:01:51.678
I never thought I'd see your kind.

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:52.779
WNM.

00:01:54.247 --> 00:01:56.149
Tell me, what's your next move?

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.184
I bet you can guess.

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.688
I'm the bodyguard.

00:02:01.688 --> 00:02:03.523
Now, I can finally have some fun.

00:04:23.463 --> 00:04:25.298
I'm really sorry.

00:04:25.298 --> 00:04:27.300
I didn't mean to make this so awkward.

00:04:28.434 --> 00:04:29.469
Don't apologize.

00:04:30.903 --> 00:04:32.972
I asked you. I wanted you to do it with me.

00:04:32.972 --> 00:04:33.606
[Startled gasp]

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.312
Well, I feel awkward saying

00:04:39.312 --> 00:04:42.315
this after what almost just happened,

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:44.717
but please take better care of yourself, Miss Kishimoto.

00:04:47.353 --> 00:04:48.421
Useless boy.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.029
Yeah. She totally hates me.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:03.536
[Frustrated growl]

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.071
Damn it, these wounds really sting.

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.474
It's a real shame he managed to kick your ass, too.

00:05:09.742 --> 00:05:11.678
Hey. What the hell was that for?

00:05:11.678 --> 00:05:12.712
Was trying to take care of you.

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:17.216
Who could have guessed a bodyguard would have been so strong?

00:05:17.216 --> 00:05:18.484
MUS.

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:21.587
You must make the ultimate sacrifice.

00:05:22.522 --> 00:05:24.090
- Commander... - WPM.

00:05:25.892 --> 00:05:28.161
We must proceed with this mission at all costs.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:29.696
No more delays.

00:05:29.696 --> 00:05:30.897
Do you understand?

00:05:32.065 --> 00:05:34.367
In that case, reinforcements are needed.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:35.968
Stronger weapons is fine.

00:05:35.968 --> 00:05:37.337
S-So you can speak!

00:05:37.337 --> 00:05:38.805
Ah, yes.

00:05:40.106 --> 00:05:41.808
The disaster at Salashno,

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.544
And that family who refused to

00:05:44.544 --> 00:05:45.511
accept their fate.

00:05:49.582 --> 00:05:51.017
You will not hurt my family!

00:05:56.489 --> 00:05:57.857
Fall back, everyone! Retreat at once!

00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.593
Goodbye, my Lilith...

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:12.305
Commander Cliff.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:12.872
Are you all right, sir?

00:06:14.173 --> 00:06:15.675
Damn it all.

00:06:15.675 --> 00:06:17.577
That insolent woman even got to the Captain.

00:06:17.577 --> 00:06:18.578
Odin Romuald...

00:06:19.278 --> 00:06:20.046
[Gasp]

00:06:26.185 --> 00:06:27.620
Mama. Papa.

00:06:28.788 --> 00:06:30.556
Papa. Where is Mama?

00:06:32.191 --> 00:06:33.593
Lilith. Your mother has to take care of something.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.628
Mama.

00:06:35.628 --> 00:06:36.596
I want to see Mama.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:40.199
Dear daughter, I have a gift for you Lilith.

00:06:43.269 --> 00:06:45.571
When the time came, your mother and I wanted you to have this.

00:06:46.773 --> 00:06:47.774
Here... perfect fit.

00:06:55.848 --> 00:06:57.750
My parents sacrificed everything so that I could survive.

00:06:59.185 --> 00:07:00.153
The survivor of Salashno.

00:07:00.953 --> 00:07:01.721
So...

00:07:04.257 --> 00:07:06.192
I refused to die without fulfilling my destiny!

00:07:11.397 --> 00:07:12.031
Hey. Check those two out.

00:07:12.632 --> 00:07:13.533
Too much tongue.

00:07:15.234 --> 00:07:15.835
He should really get a room.

00:07:17.103 --> 00:07:19.071
Wow. Does your boyfriend grab your legs like that?

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.707
Not if he wants to use his hands for anything else.

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.944
Where else do his hands go?

00:07:24.944 --> 00:07:25.478
Well, if you really want to know...

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:29.015
[Giggle] That was more satisfying than I expected.

00:07:31.818 --> 00:07:32.785
Hey, the guy just passed out.

00:07:34.153 --> 00:07:35.054
[Shocked gasp] [Terrified scream]

00:07:37.623 --> 00:07:38.758
It's mostly clean.

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:46.232
Now to spread my wings.

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:56.209
I can't believe Shinto is serious about making love to me.

00:07:59.212 --> 00:08:00.813
There was nothing gentle in his eyes at all.

00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:06.986
I guess he's not useless after all,

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:10.857
but a man filled with sexual desire.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:14.293
Camilla!

00:08:16.028 --> 00:08:17.530
I'm surprised it took you this long to notice me.

00:08:17.530 --> 00:08:18.931
I had a good view.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.933
How did you get in here?

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:24.403
Why are you in my shower?

00:08:24.403 --> 00:08:26.606
Well, is your guardian. I must stay near you and show my affections.

00:08:26.606 --> 00:08:27.273
Just like this...

00:08:28.174 --> 00:08:29.075
Does this feel nice?

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.611
Don't get so close to me.

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:33.246
Now, don't be shy.

00:08:33.246 --> 00:08:34.180
We're both girls.

00:08:35.314 --> 00:08:36.949
Cut it out!

00:08:36.949 --> 00:08:39.051
Your body got very curvy.

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:42.855
You've really filled out since the last time I saw you.

00:08:42.855 --> 00:08:45.258
You feel delicious.

00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.993
I bet other women are quite jealous of these.

00:08:48.794 --> 00:08:50.029
Is that all you came here to tell me Camilla?

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.399
That's right.

00:08:53.399 --> 00:08:56.302
Although there is something else you should be doing with this sexy body.

00:08:58.804 --> 00:09:00.907
How about we take a bath together and I'll show you?

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:02.475
Why would I want to do that?

00:09:02.475 --> 00:09:02.909
Lighten up, Lilith.

00:09:05.111 --> 00:09:05.745
[Dejected sigh]

00:09:06.512 --> 00:09:07.747
She definitely hates me.

00:09:14.253 --> 00:09:17.189
Hey. Hey, Lilith, listen to this.

00:09:17.189 --> 00:09:19.759
Some weird guys tried to barge in while you were in the

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.627
shower, but I held them all off by myself.

00:09:22.428 --> 00:09:24.196
Ain't I the greatest?

00:09:24.196 --> 00:09:25.331
Praise me, Lilith.

00:09:25.331 --> 00:09:26.132
Go on and praise me!

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:29.835
Oh? What are you doing down there?

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.371
It's so ugly. As usual.

00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:36.175
Camilla! Who the hell let you in here?

00:09:37.543 --> 00:09:38.911
Why are you here?

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:40.346
Wait, did I forget something?

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:45.017
And you call yourself her bodyguard?

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:46.953
Bodyguards are not allowed to sleep on the job.

00:09:46.953 --> 00:09:47.787
Keep your eye on Lilith, you ugly mutt.

00:09:49.956 --> 00:09:52.291
I am protecting Lilith, you ugly, old, bat...

00:09:52.291 --> 00:09:53.326
Bye-bye, ugly doggy...

00:09:55.795 --> 00:09:58.598
Jeez. What is her problem?

00:09:58.598 --> 00:10:01.000
She never calls and then thinks she can walk all over me?

00:10:03.703 --> 00:10:04.837
So there you are, Plum.

00:10:10.576 --> 00:10:11.277
Please. No!

00:10:15.881 --> 00:10:18.050
From the fire comes first life...

00:10:19.085 --> 00:10:21.120
To the flames we must return...

00:10:22.288 --> 00:10:24.156
To be born again with this mark...

00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:28.160
To set ashes tonight in the chain!

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:29.028
[Startled gasp]

00:10:33.366 --> 00:10:36.135
I already know I cannot escape my destiny.

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.739
The mark on your chest is the seal of the Moroi's ritual.

00:10:43.075 --> 00:10:45.945
Your mission is to conceive a child of the Romuald bloodline,

00:10:45.945 --> 00:10:48.414
kill them both and bathe in their blood.

00:10:48.414 --> 00:10:51.384
It is a righteous goal, all for the advancement of the Strigoi.

00:10:51.384 --> 00:10:54.320
If you cannot accomplish this task, your mark will burn

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:56.689
forever and you alone will bear this curse.

00:11:01.293 --> 00:11:04.130
Camilla. It's not that I'm afraid to lose my virginity.

00:11:05.998 --> 00:11:08.034
I will carry his child no matter what happens.

00:11:08.968 --> 00:11:10.369
My resolve will never waver.

00:11:13.706 --> 00:11:15.041
Hearing that sets my mind at ease.

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:29.889
Oh, Miss Kishimoto.

00:11:29.889 --> 00:11:33.159
I'm sitting next to you, and you spent the whole class checking her out?

00:11:33.159 --> 00:11:35.094
Do you think I'll let you get away with this?

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.729
She's been checking me out this whole time.

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:38.964
She doesn't hate me.

00:11:39.932 --> 00:11:41.067
I'm so happy.

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.908
Shin, we come from the same town in Kyushu, don't you see?

00:11:48.908 --> 00:11:50.076
The best of friends from the beginning.

00:11:50.076 --> 00:11:51.010
Don't throw that away.

00:11:53.112 --> 00:11:55.281
Not for some slutty bimbo transfer student.

00:11:56.248 --> 00:11:58.217
Stupid Shin, you horny... [Gasp]

00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:02.088
It's bleeding.

00:12:05.224 --> 00:12:07.893
Oh. I hope it's not deep.

00:12:07.893 --> 00:12:09.328
Huh? Where did it go?

00:12:18.604 --> 00:12:20.306
VNB, what's that?

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.042
A very nice breeze.

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:23.876
That's what I meant.

00:12:25.277 --> 00:12:27.580
- You're very deep, sir. - At times.

00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:29.315
So what are we going to do?

00:12:29.315 --> 00:12:31.650
Are you sure about awakening him forcibly?

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:32.518
Commander Cliff Strive.

00:12:35.121 --> 00:12:36.422
He is the descendant of the Romuald bloodline.

00:12:38.190 --> 00:12:40.326
It would be nice if we managed to do that.

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:41.894
I don't care how it happens, we will need him.

00:12:43.829 --> 00:12:45.264
But it would be better if he accepted it willingly.

00:12:46.499 --> 00:12:48.400
Right. Especially against a Moroi.

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:53.439
I wonder how the world will react with the knowledge of these beings.

00:12:53.439 --> 00:12:55.107
So what it really comes down to is...

00:12:58.644 --> 00:12:59.278
Essentially ancient folklore.

00:13:00.479 --> 00:13:01.046
Am I right?

00:13:05.117 --> 00:13:06.018
What are you doing, Cammot?

00:13:06.852 --> 00:13:08.254
No, don't play with that.

00:13:09.789 --> 00:13:11.157
This is something Grandpa gave me.

00:13:11.157 --> 00:13:12.992
It belonged to Mom.

00:13:12.992 --> 00:13:16.562
Huh? Feels like something is inside.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.597
What is this stone?

00:13:21.066 --> 00:13:22.835
Was it always inside?

00:13:22.835 --> 00:13:23.836
[Heartbeat thump] [Pained gasp]

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:25.437
My chest...

00:13:26.772 --> 00:13:27.940
Something inside.

00:13:29.241 --> 00:13:31.477
Oh! Shinta, you begun to awaken.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.181
C-Cammot?

00:13:35.181 --> 00:13:35.981
Shinta, you've awakened!

00:13:37.383 --> 00:13:39.118
I've been expecting this for a very long time.

00:13:39.919 --> 00:13:41.020
What? Cammot?

00:13:42.354 --> 00:13:45.357
Cammot, you are... Cammot, right?

00:13:45.357 --> 00:13:47.760
Shinta, things are going to get really scary from now on.

00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.561
You might be in danger, but...

00:13:50.930 --> 00:13:53.265
It's okay!

00:13:53.265 --> 00:13:55.000
Cammot's here to save the day!

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.910
Sorry, still working on my landing.

00:14:07.346 --> 00:14:08.647
Oh, Shinta is your chest okay?

00:14:10.082 --> 00:14:11.617
Oh, the pain is gone.

00:14:11.617 --> 00:14:12.685
But wait a sec.

00:14:12.685 --> 00:14:13.152
Who are you?

00:14:13.752 --> 00:14:14.920
It's me. Cammot!

00:14:16.956 --> 00:14:17.656
- Cammot? - It's okay.

00:14:19.491 --> 00:14:20.926
But you're a cat.

00:14:20.926 --> 00:14:22.261
It's ooookay!

00:14:23.829 --> 00:14:25.931
Cammot is your trusted friend!

00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:27.633
But how did my cat learn to talk?

00:14:27.633 --> 00:14:28.267
Ah-ah-ah!

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:32.938
As long as Cammot is with you, everything will be okay.

00:14:32.938 --> 00:14:33.639
Oh, but Shinta...

00:14:37.543 --> 00:14:40.145
Be careful when you're around that woman with red hair and red eyes.

00:14:40.145 --> 00:14:41.547
Red hair and eyes.

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.050
Ga, ga ga!

00:14:46.652 --> 00:14:47.152
[Mischievous giggle]

00:14:48.087 --> 00:14:49.455
Read all these!

00:14:49.455 --> 00:14:50.923
What is this?

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:53.425
\"Shinta's hopeless life\"?

00:14:53.425 --> 00:14:56.328
Welll... in this one Shinta discovers how to masturbate

00:14:58.831 --> 00:15:00.666
and in this one is about the time he grew underfur on his balls!

00:15:02.735 --> 00:15:05.771
Wait! The first time I mas- I mean, grew underfur wasn't there!

00:15:05.771 --> 00:15:06.538
Well, maybe a little.

00:15:07.539 --> 00:15:09.041
It's okay.

00:15:09.041 --> 00:15:10.476
I'll always be by your side.

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:10.943
Ready to help.

00:15:12.244 --> 00:15:14.013
Uh... that wasn't really the point.

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:19.585
So you wrote all of these Cammot?

00:15:22.288 --> 00:15:24.056
[Meows]

00:15:24.056 --> 00:15:25.357
You even wrote about when Mom died.

00:15:26.825 --> 00:15:28.260
Oh, and even Grandpa's...

00:15:29.061 --> 00:15:29.728
Romuald.

00:15:31.130 --> 00:15:33.265
Where have I heard that before?

00:15:34.233 --> 00:15:35.367
- [Gasp] - Blood of Romuald.

00:15:39.038 --> 00:15:40.673
Kishimoto, she said.

00:15:42.841 --> 00:15:44.376
She said the exact same thing.

00:15:48.981 --> 00:15:51.517
Kishimoto. Just what are you?

00:15:56.989 --> 00:15:58.257
Romuald's bloodline.

00:16:00.326 --> 00:16:01.760
I know Grandpa said something about it a long time ago.

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:05.631
It's no use.

00:16:06.298 --> 00:16:07.333
I can't remember.

00:16:07.967 --> 00:16:09.468
Huh? Who's that?

00:16:14.473 --> 00:16:15.007
W-what!?

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:19.178
Sakamoto.

00:16:20.813 --> 00:16:21.680
Romuald's blood...

00:16:22.247 --> 00:16:23.048
[Startled gasp]

00:16:25.617 --> 00:16:29.121
Fate will not allow the love of a Strigoi and hunter.

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.490
Ask yourself why your blood is interfering.

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:33.726
My blood is interfering?

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.195
Wait, Sakamoto.

00:16:40.032 --> 00:16:41.200
Oh, there you are, Shin.

00:16:42.234 --> 00:16:43.135
Why are you hiding in here?

00:16:44.903 --> 00:16:46.271
Hey, let's grab some lunch.

00:16:47.473 --> 00:16:48.307
Oh, sorry.

00:16:49.308 --> 00:16:50.275
I have to pass today.

00:16:50.976 --> 00:16:52.311
What? Why?

00:16:54.646 --> 00:16:55.347
Is everything okay?

00:16:55.981 --> 00:16:57.316
No, it's fine.

00:16:58.384 --> 00:17:00.519
I just need time to figure things out.

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:01.653
Sorry.

00:17:01.653 --> 00:17:02.454
Wait. Shin!

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:06.125
I wanted to ask you something.

00:17:10.929 --> 00:17:12.564
My body is acting strange.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:18.303
When I cut my finger, the bleeding stopped right away.

00:17:18.303 --> 00:17:20.172
It hurt at first, but soon the pain and

00:17:20.172 --> 00:17:21.507
scar disappeared without a trace.

00:17:25.244 --> 00:17:26.745
It's like I've become something inhuman.

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:29.581
But what's happened to me?

00:17:31.450 --> 00:17:32.451
Please help me, Shin.

00:17:33.986 --> 00:17:34.553
I'm scared.

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:40.626
Silver bullets.

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:42.261
It won't be long until they're all blessed with holy water.

00:17:43.729 --> 00:17:46.131
Yeah. They've given us some serious weaponry this time.

00:17:46.131 --> 00:17:48.834
T0L. They want us

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.036
to use top of the line weapons on this very

00:17:51.036 --> 00:17:52.171
important mission.

00:17:53.772 --> 00:17:56.341
In the case of Romuald's descendant,

00:17:56.341 --> 00:17:57.443
his awakening would be convenient for us.

00:17:59.545 --> 00:18:02.414
Most likely, if the descendant does awaken,

00:18:02.414 --> 00:18:04.149
he will kill the target for us.

00:18:04.583 --> 00:18:06.351
KTU.

00:18:11.056 --> 00:18:11.690
Hmm.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:25.070
Oh. I found my absolute favorite food!

00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:27.539
And it's honey flavored.

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:28.907
I have a good feeling about tonight.

00:18:36.782 --> 00:18:37.783
It's a silver chain.

00:18:38.851 --> 00:18:41.120
Lilith, be careful.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:41.653
[Startled gasp]

00:18:42.988 --> 00:18:46.492
Did I wake you? Sorry to disturb, princess...

00:18:46.492 --> 00:18:47.659
But I need to borrow you.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.800
I'm sorry, Lilith.

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:56.468
They must have known that silver is my weakness.

00:18:57.269 --> 00:19:00.939
[Banging knocks]

00:19:01.907 --> 00:19:02.741
Uh, hello?

00:19:03.442 --> 00:19:04.276
Yes. Who's there?

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.883
This is a message from Mr. Cliff?

00:19:18.524 --> 00:19:20.792
In ancient times, the nobles would gather

00:19:20.792 --> 00:19:22.361
peasants much like this.

00:19:24.897 --> 00:19:27.232
It brought them great pleasure to humiliate the lower class.

00:19:30.802 --> 00:19:32.905
I have to admit, I'm enjoying the feeling itself.

00:19:35.007 --> 00:19:38.610
You may not have noticed,

00:19:38.610 --> 00:19:40.746
but this gun is loaded with silver bullets.

00:19:43.682 --> 00:19:46.385
If a silver bullet pierces your body, you will

00:19:46.385 --> 00:19:48.220
disintegrate, proving you're not human.

00:19:50.489 --> 00:19:53.492
You don't want the Strigoi to die with you, do you?

00:19:53.492 --> 00:19:55.794
Start begging for your life!

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:59.498
This gun that you're sucking on.

00:19:59.498 --> 00:20:00.832
Even if you beg it may still go off.

00:20:03.735 --> 00:20:04.836
Careful with that pretty mouth.

00:20:06.371 --> 00:20:09.441
Or I may shoot just like this.

00:20:13.946 --> 00:20:15.881
Unfortunately, I'm not the one who will end you.

00:20:18.750 --> 00:20:21.620
Although that person will be here any minute.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:22.888
So until then, behave!

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:31.863
Pervert. You get off on shaming others, don't you?

00:20:33.365 --> 00:20:34.333
I'm just getting started.

00:20:39.037 --> 00:20:41.006
Such cold, white skin.

00:20:42.074 --> 00:20:42.374
-What are you..? - Oh!

00:20:44.610 --> 00:20:47.579
I'm just considering removing your nipple from your lovely breast.

00:20:49.114 --> 00:20:50.682
Your body responds at the lightest touch.

00:20:53.518 --> 00:20:55.787
And here I thought a Strigoi's body would be much

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:56.888
harder to slice.

00:20:57.656 --> 00:20:59.825
Shut up!

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:04.529
Where should we go next? Shall I pierce your belly button?

00:21:04.529 --> 00:21:06.732
Or maybe I should insert my blade lower.

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:11.703
I wonder if your body is cold everywhere.

00:21:13.372 --> 00:21:14.773
I bet there's one place that's warm.

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:17.676
S-stop.

00:21:19.011 --> 00:21:20.746
Why are you doing this?

00:21:20.746 --> 00:21:24.016
Isn't it obvious? Do you know the word \"caso\"?

00:21:25.217 --> 00:21:27.386
It means to bring ruin in Latin.

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:30.455
The word suits your kind very well.

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:35.093
It sounds similar to the Japanese word \"kuso\".

00:21:35.093 --> 00:21:38.697
\"Shit\". Which is what your kind is full of.

00:21:42.034 --> 00:21:44.403
So how do you like the taste of my ruin?

00:21:48.106 --> 00:21:50.475
It's hard to imagine your kind of survived and is

00:21:50.475 --> 00:21:53.145
still alive in the modern world.

00:21:53.145 --> 00:21:55.647
But even God makes mistakes and it falls

00:21:55.647 --> 00:21:57.549
on man to clean up after him.

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.552
Do whatever you want.

00:22:00.552 --> 00:22:02.487
You may defile my body, but you'll never break my...

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:12.731
Why are you here?

00:22:14.132 --> 00:22:15.367
Miss... Miss Kishimoto.

00:22:21.039 --> 00:22:21.807
Why?

00:22:23.608 --> 00:22:25.811
We've been waiting for you. Heir of Romuald.

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:28.647
Mr. Cliff.

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:31.683
Why are you..? What are you doing here?

00:22:31.683 --> 00:22:33.151
Come on. We've got to help Miss Kishimoto.

00:22:33.151 --> 00:22:34.519
Hurry!

00:22:34.519 --> 00:22:35.787
Don't you dare call that trash by name!

00:22:37.723 --> 00:22:40.192
What kind of joke is this?

00:22:40.192 --> 00:22:42.094
That girl is not human.

00:22:42.094 --> 00:22:44.162
She is filthy vermin.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:44.796
Vermin?

00:22:46.465 --> 00:22:48.433
It is your duty to eliminate such filth.

00:22:50.469 --> 00:22:51.570
Please use this sword.

00:22:52.938 --> 00:22:54.940
Here.

00:22:54.940 --> 00:22:58.043
Eliminate? I don't know what you're talking about, but...

00:22:58.043 --> 00:22:58.977
[Soft chuckle]

00:22:58.977 --> 00:23:01.980
UYR.

00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:04.516
It is time for you to understand your role

00:23:04.516 --> 00:23:06.151
in this world we live in.

00:23:06.151 --> 00:23:10.021
I still don't understand what is going on?

00:23:10.021 --> 00:23:11.289
Do not worry.

00:23:11.289 --> 00:23:12.491
I will assist you.

00:23:12.491 --> 00:23:14.025
[Soft chuckle]

00:23:16.294 --> 00:23:18.630
Now, honourable descendant.

00:23:18.630 --> 00:23:20.799
Let's do this together.

00:23:20.799 --> 00:23:22.467
Wait just a minute.

00:23:22.467 --> 00:23:24.469
If we stab her, then she'll die.

00:23:24.469 --> 00:23:26.171
Of course she will die.

00:23:26.171 --> 00:23:28.673
She deserves to die.

00:23:28.673 --> 00:23:30.142
Now do this and take your place as a man.

00:23:31.143 --> 00:23:33.178
No, Mr. Cliff.

00:23:33.178 --> 00:23:34.579
This isn't right. I don't want to become a man like this.

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.683
Please let me go. Mr. Cliff. Please!

00:23:38.683 --> 00:23:39.918
- Please! - It's okay.

00:23:41.052 --> 00:23:43.455
That thing over there isn't human.

00:23:43.455 --> 00:23:45.157
If you stab her through the heart with a

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:47.592
silver blade, she will disintegrate, leaving

00:23:47.592 --> 00:23:48.627
no trace behind.

00:23:50.228 --> 00:23:50.896
Mr. Cliff, please stop.

00:23:51.963 --> 00:23:53.532
This is wrong. I don't want to!

00:23:54.299 --> 00:23:55.667
No! I won't kill her!

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:58.937
- I won't! Yes, we will.

00:23:58.937 --> 00:24:00.539
For the sake of the future.

00:24:00.539 --> 00:24:01.640
[Laughter]

00:24:06.812 --> 00:24:09.181
What? He's... he's already awakened!?

00:24:11.349 --> 00:24:12.851
[Angry shout]

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:19.891
- Little brat. - Stop!

00:24:21.126 --> 00:24:22.127
He is the true heir.

00:24:23.495 --> 00:24:24.729
Let's fall back for tonight.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:26.264
But, Commander!

00:24:28.033 --> 00:24:30.769
FRO. Fall out and retreat at once.

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.208
That was not what I was expecting, heir of Romuald.

00:24:38.376 --> 00:24:40.946
You have not seen the last of us, descendant. Farewell.

00:24:42.547 --> 00:24:44.716
[Panting]

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.130
I'm sorry. I'm not looking.

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:02.467
Everything's okay now.

00:25:02.467 --> 00:25:03.034
Here.

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:08.173
Uh...

00:25:13.645 --> 00:25:15.647
I'm glad you're safe now, Lilith.

00:25:17.249 --> 00:25:17.782
Thank you.
