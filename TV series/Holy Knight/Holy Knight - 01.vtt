My dear daughter...

I'm sorry, Lilith.

You must be strong!

Yes! A child is born from the union of two people who are deeply in love...

A-at least my grandpa said that. So, uh...

00:12:15.501 --> 00:12:16.969

O-oh. I-I wasn't really hiding. I was just... uh...

Just what did you do with her, Shin!?

00:13:18.764 --> 00:13:22.168
Nothing really happened. It was... so fast, I mean.

Let's go.

00:16:39.565 --> 00:16:40.800
Step aside.

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:42.134
Chizuru!

00:16:45.438 --> 00:16:46.372
Shinta!

00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:49.942
Hey! Kishimoto, wait a second!

00:16:50.843 --> 00:16:52.478
I can't wait. I'm in a hurry.

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:56.315
Be a good boy and just do as I say.

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:59.018
B-but... what!?

00:17:04.223 --> 00:17:05.925
Miss Kishimoto?

00:17:05.925 --> 00:17:07.326
Hey! Miss Kishimoto?

00:17:09.328 --> 00:17:11.263
Kishimoto! What's wrong!? Are you okay!?

00:17:18.838 --> 00:17:19.905
Uh...

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:24.243
What should I do now?

00:17:26.812 --> 00:17:28.013
Miss Kishimoto!

00:17:28.881 --> 00:17:30.116
Papa...

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:36.021
Her hand is always so cold...

00:17:37.389 --> 00:17:39.058
No... together...

00:17:42.394 --> 00:17:44.396
We can escape.

00:17:44.396 --> 00:17:45.464
Please, come...

00:17:47.867 --> 00:17:49.568
Pa-Papa...

00:17:51.170 --> 00:17:53.105
Miss Kishimoto, hang in there.

00:17:56.809 --> 00:17:58.377
What's wrong, Lilith? Are you hungry?

00:18:00.913 --> 00:18:03.516
I'm in trouble! Your mother's not home yet.

00:18:06.185 --> 00:18:10.189
Okay, okay. Your Papa will try to make something. Such a good kid.

00:18:12.258 --> 00:18:13.359
Papa...

00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:19.165
[Startled gasp]

00:18:23.235 --> 00:18:24.403
Sorry, you look like you were having a bad dream.

00:18:25.538 --> 00:18:27.006
So I wanted to make you feel better...

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:29.909
I see...

00:18:31.877 --> 00:18:34.413
You passed out when we were walking, so I brought you here.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:40.319
Maybe you... that is... would you like something to eat?

00:18:42.054 --> 00:18:45.391
Except I don't really have anything here, and I can't really cook.

00:18:46.859 --> 00:18:48.460
I uh, only have instant noodles.

00:18:49.929 --> 00:18:51.831
Should I, uh, go out and get you something else?

00:18:51.831 --> 00:18:52.464
That will do.

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:57.970
Uh, really? Are you sure? I mean, I guess, if you want...

00:18:59.071 --> 00:19:01.040
But uh... you sure you want this?

00:19:01.874 --> 00:19:03.175
I mean, it's not that great.

00:19:07.112 --> 00:19:08.948
Am I... am I seeing things?

00:19:10.482 --> 00:19:12.585
I think that should just about do it.

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.422
Lilith, just a bit longer.

00:19:18.390 --> 00:19:21.393
Papa's cooking a very yummy stew for you right now.

00:19:24.029 --> 00:19:26.298
N-no... i-it can't be!

00:19:26.298 --> 00:19:27.199
Not...

00:19:28.167 --> 00:19:30.069
I'm sorry, this is all I have.

00:19:44.116 --> 00:19:45.618
Terrible.

00:19:45.618 --> 00:19:47.887
Huh!? You don't like it?

00:19:47.887 --> 00:19:50.389
Really, I don't think it's... it's not that bad.

00:19:53.459 --> 00:19:54.426
[Choking gasps]

00:20:08.574 --> 00:20:11.143
Awful.

00:20:11.143 --> 00:20:14.480
Aw, come on! This one is my absolute favorite. Is it really that bad?

00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:20.085
Alright, suit yourself! But this is really good!

00:20:20.552 --> 00:20:22.621
Huh?

00:20:22.621 --> 00:20:27.359
One two, one two! Row! Push! Work that chest, baby!

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:29.595
Row yourself over to your lover!

00:20:29.595 --> 00:20:31.797
But imagine all the things your hands can do!

00:20:31.797 --> 00:20:32.998
One two, one two!

00:20:32.998 --> 00:20:36.635
Who. Does. She. Think. She is!?

00:20:40.272 --> 00:20:42.775
Where did she come from!?

00:20:42.775 --> 00:20:46.245
Ooo, I will never lose to some evil seductress!

00:20:46.245 --> 00:20:48.447
I will never give up on Shin! Never!

00:20:50.950 --> 00:20:52.685
[Giggle]

00:20:54.019 --> 00:20:57.189
Yeah! Something godly has descended!

00:20:57.189 --> 00:20:58.757
Beautiful! Oh, godly! High liver!

00:21:00.025 --> 00:21:01.727
Is taking pictures really so fun?

00:21:01.727 --> 00:21:03.262
Yeah!

00:21:04.196 --> 00:21:05.497
How about this?

00:21:05.497 --> 00:21:06.565
Or this?

00:21:10.102 --> 00:21:12.037
Now can you do it like this?

00:21:12.037 --> 00:21:13.639
Sure thing!

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:19.411
Oooh right! I need to update my diary on Shinta!

00:21:21.213 --> 00:21:24.249
Let's see. Today Shinta was hopeless, and not good at anything at all.

00:21:25.084 --> 00:21:28.087
Oh, cute! Ooo, cute!

00:21:29.722 --> 00:21:33.225
Shinta is just... well, he's just... really a mess.

00:21:33.225 --> 00:21:35.094
So! I decided that...

00:21:35.928 --> 00:21:37.496
...I'll protect Shinta!

00:21:38.797 --> 00:21:40.165
It's okay!

00:21:51.143 --> 00:21:52.378
Hey. Hey, Lilith.

00:21:53.812 --> 00:21:55.781
Don't you think the girl with the big booty is

00:21:55.781 --> 00:21:58.584
hanging around the Romuald boy is really annoying?

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:05.391
Hey, Lilith. Hey, Lith! Hey, hey, hey! Hey, Lilith!

00:22:05.391 --> 00:22:06.525
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey! Lilith, hey!

00:22:06.525 --> 00:22:07.659
Shut up!

00:22:09.361 --> 00:22:10.796
Just cut that out right now!

00:22:20.072 --> 00:22:21.707
What is this strange feeling?

00:22:24.810 --> 00:22:27.179
His hands... they were warm.

00:22:30.916 --> 00:22:32.785
No. He's nothing like him!

00:22:36.889 --> 00:22:40.292
I have a sacred duty to perform, no matter what.

00:22:51.804 --> 00:22:53.872
I must conceive a child from the heir of the Romuald bloodline.

00:22:54.773 --> 00:22:57.242
Shinta Mizumara.

00:22:57.242 --> 00:22:59.711
I will kill him along with the child, and bathe in their blood.

00:23:02.414 --> 00:23:03.816
That is... that is my destiny!

00:23:17.162 --> 00:23:21.100
The number you dialed is not available at this time.

00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:22.701
Please try your call again later.

00:23:22.701 --> 00:23:24.136
Oh, Shin.

00:23:24.136 --> 00:23:25.170
The number you dialed...

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.406
What are you doing?

00:23:27.406 --> 00:23:29.875
Miss Sakamoto. How long have you been standing there?

00:23:31.243 --> 00:23:34.513
I don't stand out too much.

00:23:34.513 --> 00:23:36.448
Oh no. It's not like that.

00:23:37.716 --> 00:23:39.785
I was just lost in my thoughts, is all.

00:23:41.019 --> 00:23:41.854
Thinking about Shinta?

00:23:43.122 --> 00:23:44.323
But... why?

00:23:46.225 --> 00:23:47.226
Yeah...

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:49.528
- You will lose him like this. - Huh?

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:52.197
Are you okay with that?

00:23:52.197 --> 00:23:54.333
No way!

00:23:54.333 --> 00:23:55.901
There's no way I'll let that happen!

00:23:55.901 --> 00:23:57.169
Where are you going?

00:23:57.169 --> 00:23:58.570
I'm going to go find Shin!

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:05.244
Ugh. Have you decided to cut school today, Lilith?

00:24:06.979 --> 00:24:10.115
Hmm. Maybe it's about time for me to step in and help her out.

00:24:10.115 --> 00:24:10.782
Huh?

00:24:12.918 --> 00:24:13.619
Who was that!?

00:24:16.321 --> 00:24:19.258
Whoa, hey! Check out the boobs and butt on her!

00:24:20.893 --> 00:24:24.096
I don't think Lilith can beat those melons!

00:24:24.096 --> 00:24:29.201
Well, I will do my duty... and attack them for Lilith!

00:24:35.774 --> 00:24:39.278
Shin. I refuse to share you with anybody else!

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:44.516
You jiggle quite nicely, baby.

00:24:45.150 --> 00:24:45.918
Huh?

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:48.754
What was that voice?

00:24:51.123 --> 00:24:54.960
Oh... those boobs really are double the size of Lilith's.

00:24:59.097 --> 00:25:00.365
What are you talking about?

00:25:02.367 --> 00:25:03.268
Ouch!

00:25:04.937 --> 00:25:07.439
Mm! What is this?

00:25:09.374 --> 00:25:13.145
The scent of a virgin. I can smell your purity.

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:14.680
But...but...

00:25:15.514 --> 00:25:17.549
Who... who are you!?

00:25:19.151 --> 00:25:22.821
Hey. Why don't you forget about that loser?

00:25:22.821 --> 00:25:24.489
You can be my friend instead, hmm?

00:25:26.892 --> 00:25:27.893
Wh-what?

00:25:33.065 --> 00:25:34.399
[Startled whimper]

00:25:39.037 --> 00:25:40.906
What... what is he doing to me!?

00:25:42.274 --> 00:25:44.409
No!

00:25:44.409 --> 00:25:47.112
Don't be so uptight, Miss Big Boobs.

00:25:47.112 --> 00:25:48.747
Thank you for your virgin lips.

00:25:50.515 --> 00:25:51.516
Your first was all mine, wasn't it?

00:25:52.451 --> 00:25:53.952
Isn't that right?

00:25:55.053 --> 00:25:56.355
No!

00:25:59.858 --> 00:26:00.792
[Laughter]

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:03.862
Mission accomplished.

00:26:03.862 --> 00:26:06.598
I've driven the enemy away from the target.

00:26:06.598 --> 00:26:07.933
You better thank me for this, Lilith.

00:26:09.134 --> 00:26:11.069
Why... why did that happen?

00:26:12.504 --> 00:26:16.508
My first kiss... stolen by a guy I've never met?

00:26:19.645 --> 00:26:21.013
Wh-why is there blood?

00:26:24.383 --> 00:26:25.717
I'm scared.

00:26:26.518 --> 00:26:27.586
Help me, Shin!

00:26:31.556 --> 00:26:33.692
Thank you for coming.

00:26:33.692 --> 00:26:36.795
So tell me... is this report correct regarding that girl?

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:39.498
That's right. The Moroi, at Salashno.

00:26:40.832 --> 00:26:43.935
Yes. She was the sole survivor that day.

00:26:43.935 --> 00:26:46.938
Then she's in the girls' dormitory right now?

00:26:46.938 --> 00:26:48.807
Yes. A holy shrine forbidden to men.

00:26:49.808 --> 00:26:51.443
Is the descendant of Romuald here?

00:26:52.944 --> 00:26:54.613
We must immediately DVT.

00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:56.682
DVT?

00:26:58.250 --> 00:27:01.086
Destroy the vampire threat.

00:27:19.938 --> 00:27:22.007
Uh oh! That means big, big trouble's here!

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:30.682
So cute! So fabulous! I shed tears for you! Oh, so wonderful!

00:27:45.130 --> 00:27:47.632
Oh, so they're here at last.

00:27:49.634 --> 00:27:50.902
Be a good boy while I'm out.

00:27:52.537 --> 00:27:54.506
Huh? Doctor, wait a minute!

00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:56.541
Doctor!

00:27:58.110 --> 00:28:01.513
I think we can take care of one little girl on our own. Right?

00:28:05.450 --> 00:28:06.485
I feel ridiculous talking to myself.

00:28:09.287 --> 00:28:12.557
Cammot, what's going on? What's wrong with me?

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:15.127
Lately I just don't feel like doing anything at all anymore.

00:28:16.561 --> 00:28:17.529
[Door knocks]

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:19.364
Uh? Who is it?

00:28:19.364 --> 00:28:20.899
[Door knocks]

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.200
I heard you the first time.

00:28:40.819 --> 00:28:42.888
Miss... Miss Kishimoto.
