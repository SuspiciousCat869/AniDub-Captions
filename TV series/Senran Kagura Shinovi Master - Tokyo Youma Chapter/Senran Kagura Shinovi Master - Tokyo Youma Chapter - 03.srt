00:00:08,708 --> 00:00:11,375
[YUMI] In this episode of
Senran Kagura Shinovi Master...

2
00:00:11,458 --> 00:00:14,000
[HOMURA] Everyone needs to be
in the best form possible.

3
00:00:14,083 --> 00:00:15,875
Indeed. I agree.

4
00:00:15,958 --> 00:00:18,166
[HARUKA] The only way to prove
it is with hands-on testing.

5
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,333
[MIRAI grunts]

6
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:21,000
That's why I told you
not to run.

7
00:00:21,083 --> 00:00:24,375
[MINORI] It's fine. Luckily,
I landed on some fluffy pillows.

8
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:27,375
[MURAKUMO] No. I'm in need
of a little boob fondling.

9
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:28,875
For research purposes.

10
00:00:29,916 --> 00:00:31,833
They'll make
your comics stand out.

11
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:33,875
[YUMI] As you can see,
it'll be a ton of fun!

12
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:06,666
[ASUKA]
I've come to realize.


13
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:11,166
There is no real justice
for shinobi.

14
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:12,833
It's meaningless.

15
00:02:12,916 --> 00:02:14,791
The sword and the shield,
all of it.

16
00:02:17,208 --> 00:02:18,250
[YUMI]
Asuka.

17
00:02:18,333 --> 00:02:20,125
Did something happen to you?

Shinobi Transformation!

19
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,291
[YUMI gasps]

20
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,125
I don't get it.

21
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:37,500
Asuka! Stop this!

22
00:02:37,583 --> 00:02:40,791
A sword by itself is only
capable of hurting people.

23
00:02:40,875 --> 00:02:44,250
And using a shield alone
is only enough to protect them.

24
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:46,416
That's why true power
must utilize the strength

25
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,791
of both the sword
and the shield.

26
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,958
You're the one
who taught me that, remember?

27
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:53,041
But now you're saying
it's meaningless?

28
00:02:57,708 --> 00:03:00,166
Shinobi Transformation!

29
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:09,583
I am Yumi.

30
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,208
And together,
we shall partake in a requiem.

Asuka.

37
00:03:56,291 --> 00:03:58,791
Oh, hey, Yumi, welcome back.

38
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,416
You're pretty late.

39
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,666
What took you so long?

40
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,583
Oh. Sorry to worry you.

41
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,166
I was just doing some thinking.

42
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,958
[MURAKUMO]
About the Shinobi Masters?

43
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:11,333
[MINORI] In my opinion,
we should totally enter it.

44
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:13,916
We gotta try and save
the Hanzo girls.

45
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,208
Minori's right.

46
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:18,708
I know it sounds
a little dangerous,

47
00:04:18,791 --> 00:04:20,333
but those girls need our help.

48
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,333
Yes, that's a good point.

49
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,500
Hey, is something wrong, Yumi?

50
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,125
You seem kind of out of it.

51
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:27,583
Oh, I hadn't noticed.

52
00:04:27,666 --> 00:04:28,750
I know.

53
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,625
Want me to make you
some shaved ice?

54
00:04:30,708 --> 00:04:32,000
It'll put some pep
in your step.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,416
No, I'm not hungry.

56
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,750
[MURAKUMO] Then perhaps
you'd like to read

57
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,333
this comic book I made.

58
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,375
I'm sure it'll raise
your spirits.

59
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:40,791
Oh, but...

60
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:42,625
I'm not into comics.

61
00:04:42,708 --> 00:04:45,750
[MURAKUMO] Have no fear.
It's not dirty or anything.

62
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:48,500
It's a story that's packed
with action and fighting!

63
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,333
Oh.

64
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:51,541
Well, okay.

65
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:56,625
[YUMI]
"I am justice."

66
00:04:56,708 --> 00:04:58,000
"No, I'm justice."

67
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,958
"I'm also justice."

68
00:05:00,041 --> 00:05:02,375
"We're all justice."
"We're all awesome."

69
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:04,625
"You're breaking
the speed limit."

[chuckles]

72
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,916
I like it. It's very funny.

73
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,958
Thanks a lot,
I needed a good laugh.

74
00:05:15,958 --> 00:05:17,291
Alas.

75
00:05:17,375 --> 00:05:19,416
Yumi. That page
was meant to depict

76
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,416
the struggles of those
who follow the path of justice.

77
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,416
Those lines are supposed to be
dead serious, not funny.

78
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,750
Oh. I'm sorry.

79
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,000
For what it's worth,
I liked it, though.

80
00:05:30,083 --> 00:05:32,250
[SHIKI] Yeah, there's
no reason to get down.

81
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,666
Here, let's have a look-see.

82
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:35,000
I wanna see.

83
00:05:35,083 --> 00:05:36,000
[MURAKUMO]
Very well, then.

84
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,708
You can read these.

85

00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:55,208
Shinobi Masters, you say?

88
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:57,541
[MIYABI] Wait, so does that mean
you've never heard of it?

89
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:59,958
Correct.
It's news to me.

90
00:06:00,041 --> 00:06:02,625
And to my knowledge, no such
tournament has ever been held

91
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:05,708
by either the good or evil
shinobi schools previously.

92
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:07,916
So, then, what they said
about deciding

93
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,625
who the strongest Shinobi is.

94
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,291
[SUZUNE]
It's very suspicious, yes.

95
00:06:13,375 --> 00:06:14,708
[RYONA moans]

96
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,625
But what should we do
about the ninjas

97
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:19,750
from Hanzo Academy
that are being held captive?

98
00:06:19,833 --> 00:06:22,000
We can't simply ignore them.

99
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:24,208
You think we should
rescue them?

100
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,583
We're evil Shinobi.

101
00:06:25,666 --> 00:06:27,666
We can't just go around
saving our enemies.

102
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:31,291
I mean, yeah, technically
they're our enemies,

103
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,625
but we have known them
for a long time, you know.

104
00:06:33,708 --> 00:06:35,958
You're letting your emotions
call the shots?

105
00:06:36,041 --> 00:06:37,125
How cute.

106
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:38,250
What's that?

107
00:06:38,333 --> 00:06:40,000
Are you saying I'm weak, Imu?

108

-[RYONA moans]
-[RYOBI grunts]

109
00:06:41,708 --> 00:06:43,000
Ryona!

110
00:06:43,083 --> 00:06:44,333
The rest of us
are trying to have

111
00:06:44,416 --> 00:06:46,041
a serious conversation here!

112
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:47,958
Sorry, Ryobi, but I figured out

113
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:50,916
how to tie myself up
using bondage ropes.

114
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,541
Pretty amazing, isn't it?

115
00:06:52,625 --> 00:06:53,583
[grunts]

116
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,750
No, it's just annoying!

117
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:57,208
Aah!

118
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:59,333
Take that, stupid dog!

119
00:06:59,416 --> 00:07:01,708
How about one of these?

120
00:07:01,791 --> 00:07:04,458
Uh. Okay.
Suzune-sensei?

121
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:05,958
What, Murasaki?

122
00:07:06,916 --> 00:07:10,000
Good ninjas and bad ninjas
are of the same coin.

123
00:07:10,083 --> 00:07:12,250
Their destruction
isn't beneficial.

124
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,125
If anything, that outcome
may prove problematic for us.

125
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:18,333
-We should help.
-Seriously?

126
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:19,791
Yes.

127
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:20,833
That does make sense.

128
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:22,166
Good point!

129
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:23,666
Besides, if we do,

130
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:27,500
then Hanzo would owe us all
a big favor, you know.

131
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,125
Suzune-sensei.

132
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:30,500
Will you grant us permission

133
00:07:30,583 --> 00:07:32,375
to partake in the Shinobi
Masters tournament?

134
00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:36,958
I am curious about what this
"Gekkou" and "Senkou" are after.

135
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:39,291
Very well.
I shall allow it.

136
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,916
[MIYABI]
Thank you so much.

137
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,250
There's clearly more to this
than meets the eye.

138
00:07:43,333 --> 00:07:45,750
We're going to give this
everything we have.

139
00:07:45,833 --> 00:07:47,541
-Got it?
-Yes.

140
00:07:47,625 --> 00:07:49,875
As if I'd ever give you
less than that, Miyabi.

141
00:07:49,958 --> 00:07:51,750
Count me in!

142
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,375
Woof, me too!

143
00:07:58,041 --> 00:08:00,500
[YUMI] It should be
around here somewhere.

144
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,750
[HOMURA] Did you come to see
Asuka's grandfather, too?

145
00:08:14,541 --> 00:08:15,583
[YUMI]
Homura!

146
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,458
I get it.
It makes sense.

147
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,083
You figured he'd know
what's goin' on with Asuka.

148
00:08:26,958 --> 00:08:28,958
-[YUMI] Um...
-Hmm?

149
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:31,000
There's something
that I need to tell you.

150
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:35,291
[HOMURA]
I see.

151
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,166
Asuka really said that, huh?

152
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,291
That's weird.

153
00:08:42,833 --> 00:08:45,041
Then again, there's no reason
for you to lie.

154
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,666
We'll just have to assume
she has a good reason

155
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,541
for her actions.

156
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,500
You see, our families
have some history.

157
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,416
Asuka's grandfather
and my grandfather

158
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,791
had a bit of a falling out.

159
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,666
[HOMURA]
I heard about that.

160
00:08:57,750 --> 00:09:00,833
I guess even good ninjas can
disagree about things sometimes.

161
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:02,708
[YUMI]
Yes.

I suppose.

Because of that, she and I
have fought each other

164

But then something changed.

You came to understand
each other?

Right.

[HOMURA]
Asuka's a very peculiar girl.

169

She's always going on
about justice

170
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:20,333
and the path of the shinobi

and all those
other good ninja cliches.

172
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:24,791
But then when you
cross swords with her,

173
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:26,416
you can feel her passion.

Indeed it does.

[HOMURA] Yumi, there's something
I've come to realize

178
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:47,291
since I started working
as a renegade shinobi.

179
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:51,333
Some people can come to
understand each other regardless

of whether they're a good ninja
or an evil ninja.

Yeah.

Are you and your team
gonna enter?

Well, no worries.

that everyone's in

00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,541
What if I told you that
the winner of the tournament

322
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:38,541
receives the privilege
of battling the ultimate youma?

323
00:16:38,625 --> 00:16:40,083
-Huh!
-Uh!

324
00:16:42,333 --> 00:16:43,833
-[MURAKUMO] Excuse me!
-Ahh!

325
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,250
[MURAKUMO]
Hmm?

326
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,666
Ooh!

327
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:48,750
[MURAKUMO]
Yes.

328
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,666
I get it now!

329
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,583
I finally understand!

330
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:55,041
The reality of gigantic jugs!

331
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Now to fondle some tiny tatas.

332
00:17:00,083 --> 00:17:01,125
[grunts]

333
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,958
That's incredibly rude!

334
00:17:03,041 --> 00:17:06,375
I'll have you know my lady lumps
have been growing a lot lately!

335
00:17:06,458 --> 00:17:09,541
Go on. I guarantee
you'll be impressed by them.

336
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:11,833
Touch 'em!

337
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,000
[MURAKUMO]
Right.

[moans]

00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,375
Uhh!

340
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,666
Well then?

341
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:30,041
They say more than
a handful is a waste,

342
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,458
but I can't really tell.

343
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:33,458
I'm not even sure
that counts as a handful.

344
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:37,458
But they are boobs, at least.
I think they were boobs.

345
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,333
Now I understand!

346
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:42,208
The new reality
of nonexistent breasts!

347
00:17:42,291 --> 00:17:44,916
-They're so tiny!
-[MIRAI wailing]

348
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,583
They're not that small!

349
00:17:47,666 --> 00:17:48,791
[HARUKA]
There, there.

350
00:17:52,958 --> 00:17:54,041
Sheesh.

351
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:56,583
[HOMURA]
Took her long enough.

352
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,333
Come on out, Asuka!

353
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,166
I know you're up here!

354
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:07,291
[ASUKA]
Homura.

355
00:18:12,916 --> 00:18:14,583
There you are.

356
00:18:19,791 --> 00:18:20,916
Whatever.

357
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,416
I've got a ton
of questions for you,

358
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,708
and I want answers.

359
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,166
Don't participate
in the Shinobi Masters.

360
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,833
I see. You're giving me
the same warning

361
00:18:27,916 --> 00:18:29,833
you gave Yumi, huh?

362
00:18:29,916 --> 00:18:32,750
I would be fine with passing
on the tournament.

363
00:18:32,833 --> 00:18:34,625
After all,
saving the Hanzo girls

364
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:37,000
is your job, not mine.

365
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,333
Look, I'm sure there's a reason
behind your actions

366
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,333
and you don't have
to share it with me.

367
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:44,250
Honestly, I couldn't care less
about the details.

368
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:47,041
So, why don't we
settle this with a fight?

Shinobi Transformation!

370

That's how you and I
have always settled things!

[BOTH grunting]

372

Because that's who we are!

How you and I have always been!

Feel free to stop me
if I'm wrong,

Asuka!

00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:11,875
Oh, Homura.

Get up already.

380
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:30,833
This isn't your style.

00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:33,708
[ASUKA]
Actually...

382
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:36,791
you're wrong.

[groans]

384
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,375
Using a sneak attack?

385
00:19:48,041 --> 00:19:49,916
That's how evil ninjas fight!

386
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,166
Why?

387
00:19:51,250 --> 00:19:52,833
What happened to that heart
of justice

388
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,458
you were always so proud of?

389
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,916
One thing I've learned...

390
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,041
is that there is no justice.

391
00:20:00,833 --> 00:20:02,416
No justice?

392
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:05,125
What a load of crap!

00:20:05,208 --> 00:20:08,458
The Asuka I know
has never thought that way!

394
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:12,125
And I would know, because
we've fought so many times!

395
00:20:12,208 --> 00:20:14,500
You and I are like light
and shadow!

That is the nature
of our relationship!

You've always been me,
and I've always been you!

Just as I'll always follow
my own path,

399

I've always been able
to count on you
