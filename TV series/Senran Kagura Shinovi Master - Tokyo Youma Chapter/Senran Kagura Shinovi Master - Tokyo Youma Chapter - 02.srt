In this episode

00:00:09,125 --> 00:00:11,166
of Senran Kagura
Shinovi Master...

3
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,166
No!

00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,083
-Ah!
-Ah!

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:16,833
[ASUKA] As you can see,
it'll be a ton of fun!

00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:53,500
[YOZAKURA and YUMI]
Let's fight fairly!

[yelling and grunting]

13
00:02:34,625 --> 00:02:36,625
[YOZAKURA] Listen.
I think that's enough.

14
00:02:36,708 --> 00:02:39,041
But why stop now?
We just got started.

15
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:41,750
Maybe I got started,
but you're not even here.

16
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:44,041
I can't fight you
when you're this distracted.

17
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,208
[sighs]

18
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,500
Oh.

19
00:02:47,583 --> 00:02:48,625
I'm sorry.

20
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:00,791
Hey, I was wondering,

21
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,541
should I buy
a cell phone?

22
00:03:02,625 --> 00:03:05,458
Look, if this is about Asuka,
then let it go already.

23
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:06,916
I'm sure you'll see her again,

24
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,833
and you can't let it
keep you from your training.

25
00:03:08,916 --> 00:03:10,541
Yeah. I guess you're right.

-Watch out!
-Yumi!

28
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,791
I'm okay.

29
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,583
Where the heck
did that arrow come from?

30
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:22,583
[YUMI]
There's a letter attached.

31
00:03:22,666 --> 00:03:25,083
It's an invitation
to a spa resort.

32
00:03:25,166 --> 00:03:26,000
[SHIKI]
Spa.

33
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:27,416
-[MINORI] Resort?
-What?

34
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:28,666
[MURAKUMO]
Again?

35
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:30,916
Let's go!
That sounds like a ton of fun!

36
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,375
Can we please?

37
00:03:32,458 --> 00:03:33,958
[MURAKUMO] Going to the spa
is an excellent way

38
00:03:34,041 --> 00:03:35,625
to train our bodies and minds.

39
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:36,833
All right, I can't wait!

40
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,000
I'll break out
my extra sexy swim suit.

41
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:40,750
[YUMI]
I hate to burst your bubbles,

42
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,416
but this invite was attached
to an arrow.

43
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:45,666
Who would walk into such
an obvious trap?

44
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:47,750
[ALL]
We would!

45
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,958
[excited chatter]

46
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,250
[MURAKUMO] I hope
I don't lose my mask

47
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:51,541
-like last time.

48

-[SHIKI] O-M-G!
-[MINORI] That was crazy!

[giggling]

50
00:03:54,916 --> 00:03:56,000
-[MURAKUMO] Remember that?
-[MINORI] I do.

51
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,250
Yozakura,

52
00:03:57,333 --> 00:03:58,416
what do you think of all this?

53
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,000
Well, it does seem
a bit suspicious,

54
00:04:01,083 --> 00:04:02,250
but who knows?

55
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:04,541
Maybe it's just
a harmless invitation.

56
00:04:04,625 --> 00:04:05,916
Perhaps. But then again,

57
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,250
that could all be
a clever ruse to trick us.

58
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,166
Are we really going
to make it that easy?

59
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,041
Yumi, quit your worrying!

60
00:04:12,125 --> 00:04:14,333
We got free tickets
to the resort last time, too,

61
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,541
and that turned out okay.

62
00:04:15,625 --> 00:04:17,333
Yeah, that was so much fun!

63
00:04:17,416 --> 00:04:19,666
Even you had
a good time there, remember?

64
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:21,625
Well, yes,
but this is different.

65
00:04:22,625 --> 00:04:23,958
[gasps]

66
00:04:24,041 --> 00:04:26,041
[MURAKUMO] If we can't come
to an agreement,

67
00:04:26,125 --> 00:04:27,958
then we'll have
to settle this another way.

68
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,666
Huh?

69
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:32,041
We'll play "Boob Rock, Paper,
Scissors" to decide our fate!

70
00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:33,333
Yay!

71
00:04:33,416 --> 00:04:35,333
Here we go, Yumi.

72
00:04:35,416 --> 00:04:38,916
Rock, paper, scissors,
but with our boobs!

73
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,500
[MURAKUMO]
Rock, paper, scissors.

74
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:41,625
[MURAKUMO/SHIKI]
Boobs!

75
00:04:41,708 --> 00:04:43,166
Okay. Again!

76
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:45,666
[YUMI gasps]

77
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,333
Yumi picked scissors,
and Shiki picked rock!

78
00:04:48,416 --> 00:04:50,291
We're going
to the spa resort! Yay!

79
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,000
[SHIKI] And it's all thanks
to the power of my boobs!

80
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:54,166
[MURAKUMO]
Nicely done!

81
00:04:54,250 --> 00:04:55,666
[YOZAKURA]
Hold on, I call foul!

82
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,458
There's no way
that was a fair match!

83
00:04:57,541 --> 00:05:00,333
Murakumo was the one calling
the shots with Yumi's knockers!

84
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:01,833
No, that's not true.

85
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,666
Yumi's gazongas were the ones
who chose scissors.

86
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:04,791
That's right!

87
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:06,500
Her boobs are so large,

88
00:05:06,583 --> 00:05:08,875
they can actually move
by themselves.

89
00:05:08,958 --> 00:05:10,166
[YUMI]
Fine, you win.

90
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,708
It's no use fighting.

91
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,750
We'll go to the resort.

92
00:05:13,833 --> 00:05:16,750
[dog howling]

93
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,625
Since we're
renegade ninjas now,

94
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:24,333
we can't afford
to mess this up.

95
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:26,791
It's been far too long
since we've had real work.

96
00:05:26,875 --> 00:05:28,708
Okay, then
let's review the plan.

97
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,000
Once the car reaches the gate,
Mirai shoots out the front tire.

98
00:05:33,291 --> 00:05:34,250
You've got it.

99
00:05:35,375 --> 00:05:37,458
[HARUKA] Yomi will handle
the mansion's security.

100
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:40,500
Hikage will take out
the bodyguards.

101
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,833
Homura's in charge
of detaining our target.

102
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:46,000
Yep. Just leave it to me.

103
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,458
As for my part,

104
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:49,333
I'll use this to get
Mister Bad Guy

105
00:05:49,416 --> 00:05:51,000
to confess his naughty deeds.

106
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:53,083
And when he does,
I'll record everything

107
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:54,500
and upload it to the internet.

108
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,708
Exactly, sounds like
you all know what to do.

Get your game faces on.

112
00:06:03,083 --> 00:06:05,125
[MIRAI]
Time for an evil politician...

113
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,166
to finally face justice.

114
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:12,250

What is all this?

120
00:06:38,625 --> 00:06:40,250
[HOMURA]
Shut your trap, old man.

121

Ah!

Who are you?

Why are you in my car?

124
00:06:43,708 --> 00:06:46,000
You know perfectly well
why I'm here.

125
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:48,708
Now be a good boy
and don't do anything stupid.

[YOMI] Ugh, what are you guys
doing here?

Duh. It's obvious.

[HOMURA]
Now I get it.

You're here to act as this
worm's bodyguards, aren't you?

Why are you just
standing around talking?

I'll give you one chance.

If you clear out now,

00:07:32,458 --> 00:07:33,375
you won't get hurt!

Argh! Shut up!

you'd beat me that easily?

Save your breath. They're gone.

I don't sense anyone.

Hey.

152
00:08:30,458 --> 00:08:32,500
You're gonna hold
a little press conference

153
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,666
where you'll tell the world all
the terrible things you've done.

154
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,916
I would never.
That's career suicide!

-[MIYABI] Are you sure?
-Okay!

156
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:42,541
I changed my mind.
I'll tell them everything!

157
00:08:42,625 --> 00:08:45,541
As instructed, we saved
this man's life tonight.

158
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,666
And you got him to confess
to his sins.

Congratulations,
you and your team

have completed your mission.

call it a draw this time.

00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:59,291
[HOMURA] Besides, fighting over
this piece of human garbage

164
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:01,541
is a waste
of everyone's skills.

165
00:09:01,625 --> 00:09:03,125
[MIYABI]
Fine by me.

166
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,458
But next time,
you won't be so lucky.

167
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,208
[HOMURA]
That's what I was gonna say.

168
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:08,833
[MIYABI chuckles]

169
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:10,041
Let's go.

170
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,166
We're leaving, too.

171
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:18,416
Wait a second.

172
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:19,708
Look at the arrow.

173
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:23,000
[HOMURA]
Huh?

174
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,333
[HARUKA]
Hmm?

175
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,708
Let's go in.

176
00:09:34,958 --> 00:09:36,583
Hey, guess what, Ryobi?

177
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,541
I went shopping and bought
a brand new swimsuit

178
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:41,166
to wear on our
spa-day-mini-vacay!

179
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,500
By swimsuit, I mean
a few scraps of fabric.

180
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,208
I'll practically be naked.

181
00:09:46,208 --> 00:09:47,250
So, you know...

182
00:09:48,208 --> 00:09:51,625
you can totally check out
my body all you want, okay?

183
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:54,125
In fact, I want you
to undress me with your eyes!

184
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:56,333
Oh, my God,
shut your dirty mouth, Ryona!

185
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,541
I came here to relax,
not to see you naked!

186
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,750
You tease!

187
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:01,208
Enough, both of you.

188
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:02,708
The real question is,

189
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,458
who sent us these free passes?

190
00:10:04,541 --> 00:10:07,125
Since we don't know
the sender's motive yet,

191
00:10:07,208 --> 00:10:08,916
it would be best
if we just played their game

192
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:09,958
for the time being.

193
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,083
I still think it's dangerous.

194
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:14,625
Well, that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

195
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:17,208
No matter what happens,
I'm going inside this spa.

196
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,291
Oh? You seem
quite dedicated.

197
00:10:19,375 --> 00:10:21,000
Yes, of course!

198
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:23,750
Nothing's gonna keep me from
seeing you in a swimsuit today!

199
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:26,541
This really isn't the time
for your shenanigans, Imu.

200
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:27,416
How shameful.

201
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,791
Uh, I was just kidding!

202
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,041
[RYOBI]
You too, Ryona!

203
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,000
[RYONA]
What? Why are you mad at me?

204
00:10:39,916 --> 00:10:41,333
[giggles]

205
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:56,291
This looks like
the changing area.

206
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,375
Uh, that you, Miyabi?

207
00:10:58,458 --> 00:11:01,458
Yumi? So I see you also
got an invitation.

208
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,125
[YUMI]
Yes. Via arrow.

209
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,541
[chuckles]
Yet you still came.

210
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,791
You do know this could be
a trap, right?

211
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:08,875
I'm well aware
of that possibility,

212
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,333
but I'm prepared.

213
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,583
We'll be sure to keep
our guard up at all times.

214
00:11:13,916 --> 00:11:15,250
[MINORI]
Hold on!

215
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,541
Are you saying we're not allowed
to go swimming?

216
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,958
Didn't you hear anything
we just said?

217
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,416
Do you really want
to play around

218
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:22,833
when it might be a trap?

219
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,291
What else do you expect
from the good ninjas?

220
00:11:25,375 --> 00:11:27,375
Their heads are filled
with naive thoughts.

221
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:29,541
No worries though,
I have the perfect proposal.

222
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,083
Just hear me out.

223
00:11:31,166 --> 00:11:32,666
You should change
into your swimsuit

224
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:34,166
before we decide if it's a trap.

225
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,291
-[MIYABI] Imu.
-I know!

226
00:11:36,375 --> 00:11:37,958
I get it, okay?

227
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,041
I just really wanna see you
in a swimsuit!

228
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:43,583
It's not like I'm asking
for that much!

229
00:11:43,666 --> 00:11:45,583
Yeah! I wanna wear
my swimsuit, too!

230
00:11:45,666 --> 00:11:47,583
Caress my body
with your dirty stares!

231
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,000
There you have it, Yumi!

232
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:50,958
We're not the only ones
who wanna go swimming.

233
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,458
[chanting]
Pool! Pool!

234
00:11:52,541 --> 00:11:53,833
Pool!

235
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,000
-[chanting continues]
-Well, then.

236
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:56,375
It looks like
they've outvoted us.

237
00:11:56,458 --> 00:11:57,750
Yes. True.

238
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,833
[HOMURA]
What's this?

239
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:00,375
Good and evil ninjas arguing

240
00:12:00,458 --> 00:12:02,083
about whether or not
to take a little dip?

241
00:12:02,166 --> 00:12:03,500
[MIYABI]
Homura!

242
00:12:03,583 --> 00:12:05,291
Just pretend to fall
for their trap

243
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,875
and the enemy
will let their guard down.

244
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:10,208
Besides, we're all shinobi.
I'm sure we can handle it.

245
00:12:10,291 --> 00:12:11,708
If you insist.

246
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,958
I guess we could
play along for now.

247
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:16,458
If nothing else, it'll be good
for the girls' spirits.

248
00:12:16,541 --> 00:12:18,291
-Yes!
-[MURAKUMO] Victory!

249
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:19,958
Can you guys please calm down?

250
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,000
[YUMI]
Then let's get changed.

251
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,958
-Yay! Right! Okay.
-[MURAKUMO] Will do!

252
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:27,958
[excited chatter]

253
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,958
[RYONA] This suit is so tight,
I keep losing it.

254
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:36,000
[chatter continues]

255
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,000
-Hooray!
-[giggles]

256
00:12:41,083 --> 00:12:42,291
[MURAKUMO]
Yay!

257
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:44,791
Ah! It's a dream come true!

258
00:12:44,875 --> 00:12:46,250
-[camera shutter clicking]
-Finally!

259
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,000
Miyabi in a bikini!

260
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:54,333
Victory! I got the shot!

261
00:12:54,416 --> 00:12:56,833
Now I can die happy.

262
00:12:56,916 --> 00:12:59,291
Ah! I have no regrets!

263
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:01,833
Look, everybody!

264
00:13:01,916 --> 00:13:04,875
Feast your eyes
on my scandalous tiny swimsuit!

265
00:13:04,958 --> 00:13:06,291
So dirty!

266
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,333
I can feel you all undressing me
with your eyes,

267
00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,458
and I love it!

268
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:14,125
There's nobody here
to undress me.

269
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,875
[RYOBI] 'Cause it's
a private party, duh.

270
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:18,125
We've got the whole place
to ourselves today.

271
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:21,708
Geez, then there's no reason
for me to even wear this thing!

272
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:25,125
It's a lot more fun to go
swimming commando anyway!

273
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,375
[RYOBI]
You perv!

274
00:13:26,458 --> 00:13:28,916
What if we don't want
to see you naked?

275
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,041
Hey, is something
bothering you, Homura?

276
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:33,125
I just thought it was strange
that Asuka's not here.

277
00:13:33,208 --> 00:13:35,458
Actually, now that
I think about it,

278
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:38,208
I haven't seen any of the
Hanzo Academy girls around.

279
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:39,916
Maybe they're just
running late.

280
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,166
I'm sure they'll show up
soon enough.

281
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,166
[YUMI] Perhaps, but why
do I feel so uneasy?

282
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,208
[GIRLS laughing]

283
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:06,041
[RYONA] [screaming]
It was an accident!

284
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:07,750
[RYOBI]
Come back here!

285
00:14:09,625 --> 00:14:11,916
[SHIKI] What's the matter, Yumi?
You seem down.

286
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:13,833
Stop being such a stick
in the mud

287
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,250
and come play
in the pool with us.

288
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,333
It'll be so much fun!

289
00:14:16,416 --> 00:14:18,083
Indeed! It's time
to cut loose!

290
00:14:18,166 --> 00:14:19,916
I'm fine. Please
don't worry about me.

291
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,708
They've got a good point.

292
00:14:21,791 --> 00:14:24,541
We've got renegade shinobi,
good ninjas, and bad ninjas

293
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,458
all in one place,
so let's have some fun.

294
00:14:26,541 --> 00:14:29,375
How about a good old-fashioned
water gun fight?

295
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:31,416
Ha! You always wanna fight.

296
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,250
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything else?

297
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:35,750
You scared? Feel free
to admit defeat then.

298
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,583
You can just sit out
and watch us destroy

299
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:38,958
the girls
from Gessen Academy.

300
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:40,958
You know,
because you're all losers.

301
00:14:41,041 --> 00:14:43,083
Tell me what
the rules are right now!

302
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:46,291
Hebijo will wipe the floor
with you sorry renegade ninjas!

303
00:14:46,375 --> 00:14:48,458
[HARUKA]
Why not use this then?

304
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:50,333
It's a special chemical
that renders

305
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,291
any clothing it touches
see-through.

306
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:57,791
Okay, I put it in every
water gun, so if you get hit,

307
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,791
anything you're wearing
will turn transparent,

308
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,208
and you'll look
completely naked.

309
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,833
[YOZAKURA] What?
That's so indecent!

310
00:15:02,916 --> 00:15:05,333
Personally, I think
it sounds like a lot of fun.

311
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,708
Once you're in the buff,
you're out of the game.

312
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,541
And whichever team has
a girl still standing

313
00:15:09,625 --> 00:15:10,791
will be named the victor.

314
00:15:10,875 --> 00:15:12,375
Any questions about the rules?

315
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:15,000
On one hand, I really want
our team to win,

316
00:15:15,083 --> 00:15:16,583
but on the other hand
I'd also like to see

317
00:15:16,666 --> 00:15:18,000
Miyabi naked.

318
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,291
I have no idea what to do
in this situation.

319
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:21,708
I think the obvious
answer is that

320
00:15:21,791 --> 00:15:23,041
you should focus
on winning.

321
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,125
[HARUKA]
Okay, I'll be the judge.

322
00:15:26,083 --> 00:15:27,333
Everybody ready?

323
00:15:27,416 --> 00:15:29,833
Right, it's time to play
"Peach Beach Splash,

324
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,625
Totally Nude Version!"

325
00:15:31,708 --> 00:15:33,166
Ready? Go!

326
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:45,666
Come on, everyone,
aim your water at me!

327
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,500
I've got ya!

328
00:15:58,583 --> 00:15:59,958
Ah!

329
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,916
[HOMURA]
Look out, Yomi!

330
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,416
This would go better for you

331
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,208
if you just shot
your guns at me!

332
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,166
No!

333
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:12,458
Ah!

334
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,208
Yah!

335
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:17,708
Ah!

336
00:16:21,166 --> 00:16:22,583
[HARUKA]
Oh, no!

337
00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:26,750
Looks like Yozakura, Yomi,
and Murasaki are all out!

338
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,250
-Ah!
-Too slow!

339
00:16:37,208 --> 00:16:38,125
[screaming]

340
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:40,916
-She got us!
-No fair!

341
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,125
[IMU]
They're too fast!

342
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:46,666
-[YUMI] You're mine!
-[MURAKUMO] Prepare to die!

343
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:47,791
No, not me!

344
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:49,875
[groans]

345
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:51,458
I can't believe I lost.

346
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,666
[HARUKA]
Another three bite the dust!

347
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,000
Imu, Shiki, and Minori
are all out!

348
00:16:59,666 --> 00:17:01,041
Hey!

349
00:17:01,125 --> 00:17:02,916
No fair. You're not supposed
to shoot the judge!

350
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,541
Bring it on, I'll destroy you!

351
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,583
I have no emotions or shame,

352
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:10,125
so being naked isn't going
to make me quit fighting you.

353
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,125
Embarrassed or not,
if we can see your goods,

354
00:17:12,208 --> 00:17:14,041
then you're disqualified.

355
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:20,333
That won't stop me.

356
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,125
You'll have to try harder!

357
00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:23,125
Ah!

358
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:24,125
Oh, no!

359
00:17:24,208 --> 00:17:25,583
[MIRAI]
Have some more!

360
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:28,583
[screaming]

361
00:17:28,666 --> 00:17:30,916
[HARUKA]
Murakumo is out of the game.

362
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:33,416
[RYOBI]
Ryona!

363
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:35,125
Come on, let's take out
Mirai together!

364
00:17:35,208 --> 00:17:36,833
Okay!

365
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:38,916
[BOTH yelling]

366
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:42,666
Uh...

367
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:45,125
Give it up, you're going down!

368
00:17:45,208 --> 00:17:46,750
No hogging the spotlight.

369
00:17:46,833 --> 00:17:49,250
I want you to get me
all wet, too!

370
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,041
Shoot me harder.
It feels so good!

371
00:17:54,125 --> 00:17:55,833
I love it!

372
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,541
Whoa, what the heck
are you doing?

373
00:17:57,625 --> 00:17:58,916
We're on the same team, dummy!

374
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,958
-[MIRAI] Ah!
-[RYONA] No!

375
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:07,916
[HARUKA] Ryobi, Ryona,
and Mirai are all out!

376
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:10,875
Only three players are left!

377
00:18:10,958 --> 00:18:13,958
It's down to Homura, Yumi,
and Miyabi for the win!

378
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:16,166
Now, it's all up
to the team captains!

379
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:17,666
I will destroy you!

380
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,166
Hebijo will be the winner!

381
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,458
I won't lose to you!

382
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,750
[ALL gasp]

383
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,000
Huh.

384
00:18:36,166 --> 00:18:37,208
Ah!

385
00:18:38,416 --> 00:18:39,458
[grunts]

386
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:41,916
[bell ringing]

387
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,333
[HARUKA] That's the end
of the match! Since you all

388
00:18:43,416 --> 00:18:45,333
shot each other
at the same time, it's a tie!

389
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:46,875
There's no way that was a tie,

390
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,625
because I was the last one
to get hit

391
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:50,291
by that stupid
chemical stuff!

392
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,750
I demand we check the playback
for a second opinion!

393
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:54,166
Yeah, there's no
playback, silly.

394
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:56,291
-[camera shutter clicks]
-We're fine with a draw.

395
00:18:56,375 --> 00:18:58,208
Yes, why don't we
call it a draw?

396
00:18:58,291 --> 00:18:59,833
More importantly,

397
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,708
can you tell us how to turn
our clothes back to normal?

398
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,250
[HARUKA]
It's easy.

399
00:19:03,333 --> 00:19:05,125
Just wash them in clean water
and they'll reappear.

400
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:06,708
[sighs]
Well, that's a relief.

401
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,041
You guys worry too much.

402
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:10,375
I think a transparent
swimsuit is awesome!

403
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,041
-Aw!
-[giggling]

404
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,416
[RYOBI]
Don't run away, you stupid cow.

405
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:16,541
[YOMI]
Isn't there hot water?

406
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:18,833
I'm surprised Asuka
and her gang never showed up.

407
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,250
Yeah, it's kinda weird.

408
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:23,166
What's this?

409
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,500
A kekkai barrier?

410
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,208
So you've finally
shown yourselves.

411
00:19:26,291 --> 00:19:27,750
I was tired of waiting.

412
00:19:30,166 --> 00:19:31,833
Never seen you before.

413
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,458
Hello, ladies.
I'm Gekkou.

414
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,333
And my name is Senkou.

415
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,333
[YUMI] Were you the ones
who sent the invitations?

416
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,625
And set up this trap?

417
00:19:38,708 --> 00:19:39,708
[SENKOU]
We are.

418
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,500
Then you owe us
some answers.

419
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:46,250
Miyabi!

420
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,583
There's no need
for you to worry.

421
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:48,541
I'm not injured.

422
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:51,791
[SENKOU]
Calm yourselves.

423
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,541
We invited you here
to see if you're willing

424
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:55,750
to participate
in a little challenge.

425
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:56,916
[MIYABI]
What do you mean?

426
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,541
We've come to invite you
to a battle

427
00:19:58,625 --> 00:20:00,791
that will determine
who is the strongest shinobi.

428
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:04,708
We're calling it
the Shinobi Masters.

429
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,458
Shinobi Masters?

430
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:08,250
Ha! You really think
we'd be stupid enough

431
00:20:08,333 --> 00:20:09,750
to go along
with something proposed

432
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,708
by two highly
suspicious people like you?

433
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:13,750
-[chuckles]
-[giggles]

434
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,041
I'm sure
you'll change your mind

435
00:20:15,125 --> 00:20:16,458
once you see our next surprise.

436
00:20:16,541 --> 00:20:19,041
[ALL gasp]

437
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:24,625
[SENKOU] If you choose
not to play our game,

438
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:26,958
these girls are dead.

439
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,291
[gasps]

440
00:20:28,375 --> 00:20:30,958
We'll tell you where
it's being held later.

441
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,458
Until we contact you,

442
00:20:32,541 --> 00:20:34,291
I suggest you keep on training.

443
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,958
Gekkou and Senkou, huh?

444
00:20:40,041 --> 00:20:41,916
I can't believe they managed
to capture the girls

445
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,250
from Hanzo Academy.

446
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:45,333
I'm not really sure
what's happening.

447
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:47,000
They've got four
of the Hanzo girls.

448
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,041
We have to find
a way to save them.

449
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,583
[HOMURA]
Agreed.

450
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,958
Asuka wasn't with them.

451
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,791
[ASUKA]
Yumi.

452
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:01,916
We need to talk.

453
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,958
Come alone.

454
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,666
[YOZAKURA]
Hey. Is something wrong?

455
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:09,208
Oh. I just remembered
there's something I have to do.

456
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:11,041
Go on without me.
I'll be home soon.

457
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,416
Okay, see you later.

458
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,541
Don't stay out too late
or you'll be tired!

459
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,500
[ASUKA]
Over here, Yumi.

460
00:21:28,708 --> 00:21:29,625
[YUMI]
Asuka!

461
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:32,875
I'm glad to see you're okay.
I was so worried!

462
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,166
[ASUKA] Did you hear
about the Shinobi Masters?

463
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:37,166
So you know about that already?

464
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,375
Does that mean the other girls
from Hanzo Academy are--

465
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,541
I won't let you participate.

466
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:44,291
There's no way you're going
to be a part of it.

467
00:21:44,375 --> 00:21:46,000
[YUMI]
What are you talking about?

468
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:50,541
I've come to realize

469
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,125
there is no justice for us.

470
00:21:53,208 --> 00:21:56,291
Both the sword and the shield
are utterly useless.

471
00:21:58,291 --> 00:21:59,333
[YUMI]
Asuka.

472
00:23:33,833 --> 00:23:35,625
Tell me where Kagura is.

473
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,166
[MURAKUMO]
Listen,

474
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:41,333
if there are breasts,
then they're mine to fondle!

475
00:23:41,416 --> 00:23:43,500
[HARUKA]
Okay, Mirai.

476
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:45,375
It's time for you to give up.

477
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:46,708
Hot springs?

478
00:23:46,791 --> 00:23:47,916
I'm in.
