[camera clicks]

165
00:08:53,875 --> 00:08:55,958
So, how do you
usually contact people

166
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:57,708
if you don't have
a cell phone?

167
00:08:57,791 --> 00:08:59,208
I just send a letter.

168
00:08:59,291 --> 00:09:01,125
What if you're
in a hurry, though?

169
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,666
A telegram.

170
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,375
Oh, wow.

171
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,583
I didn't know there were people
who still used those things.

172
00:09:07,666 --> 00:09:08,916
Do you think I'd be better off

173
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,166
if I just got a phone
like everyone else?

174
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:14,166
Hmm. It's difficult to say.

175
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,708
But, if you were to get one,
then we could totally send

That sounds like it'd be fun.

179
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,958
I've been thinking a lot lately.

180
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,708
About the real task
we take on as Shinobi.

181
00:09:47,166 --> 00:09:49,166
Pursue justice at all costs.

182
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:51,375
Even if it means
losing our lives.

183
00:09:51,458 --> 00:09:53,791
We have to do what it takes
to beat the youma.

184
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,541
Well yeah, but I think
all the girls

185
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,750
who became shinobi
are willing to do that.

186
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:01,166
I know I am.

187
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,916
I guess what I was referring
to were the little gaps

188
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,500
that we have between
our training and missions.

189
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:09,083
You know, the moments
like this one.

190
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:11,791
It's important that we don't
take them for granted.

191
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,916
Oh, you're saying work
when it's time to work,

192
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,833
but play when it's time to play.

193
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:17,666
That's what you mean, right?

194
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,375
[ASUKA giggles]

195
00:10:20,458 --> 00:10:21,708
Yeah.

196
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,500
We are high school girls.

197
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,083
Normally.

198
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:29,583
If that's all we were, then
we would be free to cut loose

199
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,375
and do whatever we wanted to.

200
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,541
The words "work" and "play"
are kind of funny, you know?

201
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:01,125
They can be
complete opposites or similar.

202
00:11:01,208 --> 00:11:02,708
It depends, right?

203
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:05,000
So, in a way, it reminds me
of something else.

204
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:06,083
Uh?

[YUMI]
"A sword and a shield."

206
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:10,208
Oh, yeah.

207
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,041
Like my grandpa always says.

208
00:11:12,125 --> 00:11:13,291
Yep.

209
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:17,666
A sword by itself is only
capable of harming others.

210
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:21,500
And a shield can protect people,
but it can't do it alone.

211
00:11:21,583 --> 00:11:23,208
That's why it's important
to wield the sword

212
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,541
and the shield together.

213
00:11:24,625 --> 00:11:26,458
To have both is to have power.

214
00:11:26,541 --> 00:11:29,208
[YUMI] If you work too much,
it's exhausting.

215
