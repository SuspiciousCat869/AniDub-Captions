That is my plan as well.

326
00:19:25,483 --> 00:19:29,108
You know, if everything
in this world has a counterpart,

327
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:31,525
then the shinobi
and <i>youma</i> are a pair.

328
00:19:31,608 --> 00:19:34,775
Perhaps one day,
you and I will face off again.

329
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,733
Who knows what the future holds?

330
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:40,483
[YUMI gasps]

331
00:19:47,858 --> 00:19:49,525
[FUBUKI]
I want you to have it.

332
00:19:49,608 --> 00:19:50,442
Are you sure?

333
00:19:50,525 --> 00:19:52,108
Yes, I don't need it.

334
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:53,983
Not like I once did.

335
00:19:56,983 --> 00:19:58,650
[YUMI]
I'll cherish it.

336
00:19:58,733 --> 00:20:00,192
[FUBUKI]
Farewell.

337
00:20:00,275 --> 00:20:03,483
I'm off to try and find my place
in this human world.

338
00:20:06,608 --> 00:20:07,817
Hey!

339
00:20:09,733 --> 00:20:13,483
Fubuki, I never had
the opportunity to fight you.

340
00:20:13,567 --> 00:20:17,067
One day, let's continue
the Shinobi Masters.

341
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,608
[FUBUKI chuckles]

342
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:36,025
You two.
Why are you still following me?

343
00:20:38,025 --> 00:20:40,233
Aren't you ever lonely
by yourself?

344
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:42,858
[FUBUKI]
No, because I'm not alone.

345
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:44,900
Somewhere, in another place,

346
00:20:44,983 --> 00:20:47,025
my mother and Rasetsu
are with me.

347
00:20:47,108 --> 00:20:49,108
And you have me
and Gekkou as well.

348
00:20:49,192 --> 00:20:50,525
That's right.

349
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:57,400
It certainly is.

350
00:21:01,567 --> 00:21:02,775
Take this.

351
00:21:04,567 --> 00:21:06,650
I want you to have the sword.

352
00:21:06,733 --> 00:21:09,233
And I'll keep the shield
with me, okay?

353
00:21:09,317 --> 00:21:10,483
Sounds good.

354
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:12,942
Thanks, Yumi!

355
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:16,192
[ASUKA]
That reminds me.

356
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:18,858
There's a question
I've always wanted to ask you.

357
00:21:18,942 --> 00:21:20,900
Okay, what is it?

358
00:21:20,983 --> 00:21:23,733
I've always wondered what kind
of shinobi you want to be.

359
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:25,942
That's a good question.

360
00:21:30,983 --> 00:21:32,567
I suppose...

361
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:38,358
I want to be the kind of shinobi
that's like this falling snow.

362
00:21:38,442 --> 00:21:40,108
[ASUKA gasps]

363
00:21:40,192 --> 00:21:42,608
It covers the world
like a blanket

364
00:21:42,692 --> 00:21:44,067
until it's warm again,

365
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:45,733
and then it melts
and disappears.

366
00:21:47,608 --> 00:21:51,817
A shinobi like the snow.
That's me.

367
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:56,150
Even when it melts,
the memory remains.

368
00:21:56,233 --> 00:21:58,733
You're right.
That makes sense.

369
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:00,108
[BOTH laugh]

370
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:01,942
Come on, we should hurry.

371
00:22:02,025 --> 00:22:03,983
Where there is light,
there is darkness.

372
00:22:04,067 --> 00:22:05,442
Okay!

373
00:22:05,525 --> 00:22:08,317
[ASUKA] This is the story
of a select group of girls.

374
00:22:10,858 --> 00:22:12,317
[YUMI, ASUKA]
They are the shinobi warriors

375
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:14,192
who live in the shadows.
