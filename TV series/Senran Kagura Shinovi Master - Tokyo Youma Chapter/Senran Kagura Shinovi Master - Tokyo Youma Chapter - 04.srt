00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:14,041
What if I were to tell you

2
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,666
that the winner
of the tournament receives

3
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:18,625
the privilege
of battling the ultimate youma?

4
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:21,625
Don't listen to her, Kagura.
She's obviously lying.

5
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,875
That's right.

6
00:00:22,958 --> 00:00:24,458
The only way she could
give you access

7
00:00:24,541 --> 00:00:26,916
to fighting the strongest youma
is if she controlled it.

8

[WOMAN 1]
Isn't there anything I can do

9
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:32,166
to convince you to join?

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:37,333
If you can control youma,
then you must be super powerful.

11
00:00:37,416 --> 00:00:38,833
Prove it.

12
00:00:38,916 --> 00:00:40,708
Very well, then.

13
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:41,666
I shall.

-Uh!
-Uh.

[whooshing]

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,625
This should be more
than sufficient.

-Ah, cool!
-[WOMAN 2] Kagura.

20
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,958
That was very impressive,
so I guess that means

21
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,875
I can show you some of my power.

22
00:01:14,375 --> 00:01:16,000
Now then. Who are you?

23
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:19,083
Fubuki. It's a pleasure.

24
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:20,416
Likewise.

25
00:01:21,375 --> 00:01:22,250
I'm sure.

26
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,000
Please don't disappoint me.

[clanking]


28
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:08,541
Kagura.

29
00:03:12,958 --> 00:03:14,000
[KAGURA]
Impressive.

30
00:03:21,125 --> 00:03:22,750
No way,
when did she even attack?

31
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,500
She didn't move or anything!

32
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,458
Such raw power.

33
00:03:30,375 --> 00:03:32,416
Tell me, who are you really?

34
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:38,375
You won't answer?
Then you leave me no choice.

35
00:03:43,791 --> 00:03:45,541
-What the...
-There's no way!

36
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:47,291
I couldn't even sense
their presence.

37
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,791
[GEKKOU] Lady Fubuki.
We've come to get you.

38
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
If you want to know who I am,

39
00:03:56,083 --> 00:03:57,708
then enter the Shinobi Masters

40
00:03:57,791 --> 00:04:00,416
and perhaps you'll find
the answer to that question.

41
00:04:02,916 --> 00:04:04,708
I'll be waiting, Kagura.

42
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:12,750
They're gone.

43
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:14,166
Are you hurt?

44
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:17,000
[KAGURA]
The Shinobi Masters, huh?

45
00:04:34,291 --> 00:04:37,125
Well, Haruka?
Is Homura gonna be okay?

46
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:40,583
Her wounds aren't fatal, but she
took some serious damage.

47
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:42,833
We're just going to have
to wait for her to wake up.

48
00:04:42,916 --> 00:04:45,708
The real question is
who did this to her?

49
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:47,625
[HARUKA] I don't know,
but the wound on her arm

50
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,000
came from a katana.

51
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,375
[MIRAI] So...
do you think it was a shinobi?

52
00:04:51,458 --> 00:04:53,458
[HARUKA]
Yes. It's likely.

53
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,416
[HIKAGE] Who, though?
There aren't a lot of people

54
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,625
who could catch Homura
off guard.

55
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,416
This is serious.

56
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,333
Unfortunately, it looks like
we're going to have

57
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,458
to withdraw
from the Shinobi Masters now.

58

00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,875
Why, Asuka?

64
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:17,875
Why did you attack me?

[YUMI] This training
that Shiki came up with

80
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,375
sure is different.

81
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,291
Is it supposed to help
with the Shinobi Masters?

82
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,333
It feels a little too easy.

83
00:06:09,416 --> 00:06:10,583
You're all doing
a fantastic job,

84
00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,833
[YUMI] But I'm sure
that she must have

85
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,333
a perfectly good reason
for choosing it.

00:06:14,416 --> 00:06:15,791
No matter what,

Come on, Minori,
don't wimp out now.

93

You know, you'll never work off
all that cake you eat

94
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,958
by just lying on the floor.

Excuse me, Shiki,
but would you mind answering

99
00:06:39,125 --> 00:06:39,958
a quick question?

100
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,458
Of course.

101
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,791
What's the specific purpose
of this training, again?

102
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:45,583
Duh, it's for
weight loss, silly.

Weight loss, seriously?

104

But time is of the essence.

Yeah, I couldn't agree more.

106
00:06:51,125 --> 00:06:52,500
Christmas is right
around the corner,

107
00:06:52,583 --> 00:06:54,125
and who knows what kind
of fattening food

108
00:06:54,208 --> 00:06:56,833
we'll be offered when we're at
all those holiday parties?

about the tournament.

It's the Gessen Girls' Academy
official newsletter.

I want you to look at the photo
in the top left hand corner.

Does that mean they go
to the middle school?

we need to investigate

as dazzlingly bright as the sun,

that illuminates the darkness.

That's the kind of justice
you must be, like the moon."

That's what Grandpa always said.

325
00:17:58,541 --> 00:17:59,875
But don't worry,
we've decided

326
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,291
we'll be the ones
to carry on his legacy.

327
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:09,208
Carry on
Grandpa Kurokage's teachings?

328
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:12,791
[GIRLS yelling and grunting]

329
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,708
What's wrong?
Is that the best you can do?

330
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,041
[yells]

331
00:18:24,583 --> 00:18:26,083
[SUZUNE] I'm confident
that the five of them

332
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,500
are well prepared
for the Shinobi Masters.

333
00:18:28,583 --> 00:18:30,958
If nothing else,
I doubt anyone they face

334
00:18:31,041 --> 00:18:32,791
will be able
to beat them easily.

335
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:36,000
However, something's
bothering me.

336
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:39,791
Recently, all of the jonin
gathered at the Kikai Dome

337
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,666
for some sort of secret mission.

338
00:18:42,625 --> 00:18:45,375
It seems rather suspicious
that the Shinobi Masters

339
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:48,000
was planned to take place
at this particular time.

340

[IMU]
Miyabi!

It's those weird twins!
Where are they?

342
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:55,500
Just ignore them.

343
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,000
This is what's important.

344
00:18:58,791 --> 00:18:59,666
[chuckles]

345
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:03,083
I was right.

00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:05,541
It's instructions regarding
the Shinobi Masters tournament.

[ALL SHINOBI]
Cool!

348
00:19:22,666 --> 00:19:23,875
I can still make it.

349
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,500
I have to protect everyone.

[MINORI]
Hah!

352
00:19:59,541 --> 00:20:01,541
It's kind of like
a concert, huh?

353
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:04,708
Pretty lights.

354
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:06,416
Well, it seems
a little excessive,

355
00:20:06,500 --> 00:20:07,833
if you ask me.

356
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,458
Be on guard, everyone.

357
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,875
There's still the possibility

358
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,041
that this entire thing
is a set-up.

359
00:20:13,125 --> 00:20:15,458
[MIYABI]
It's always good to be careful.

360
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:18,208
However, a coward won't win
the Shinobi Masters.

361
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:20,916
There's only one reason
we're participating

362
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,416
in this tournament,

363
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,791
and that is to save the girls
of Hanzo Academy.

364
00:20:29,291 --> 00:20:31,791
[spotlights switching on]

365
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,000
You can't talk
about good and evil

366
00:20:38,083 --> 00:20:39,833
unless you watch
this competition.

367
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:43,000
It's time to find out
who the strongest ninja will be

368
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,833
in the Shinobi Masters!

[GEKKOU]
Just so you know,

370
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,750
this event
is being streamed.

371
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,500
Shinobi everywhere are watching
to see who will prevail.

372
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,250
What does she mean?

373
00:20:58,333 --> 00:21:01,750
I believe that the tournament
is being broadcasted

374
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,625
on a shinobi video site.

375
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,833
Attention, it's time
for the opening speech.

376
00:21:22,125 --> 00:21:23,833
Hello, I am Fubuki,

377
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,041
the one who is hosting
this tournament.

378
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:28,291
And the reason
I've summoned you all here

379
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,625
is because you are
powerful warriors.

380
00:21:30,708 --> 00:21:32,375
You should feel honored
that you've been chosen

381
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,541
for this competition.

382
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:36,500
I had my pick
of so many fighters.

That girl.

I've seen her somewhere before.

[FUBUKI] There's no guarantee
that any of you

390
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:37,375
will leave
this competition unscathed.

391
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:39,250
Are you prepared
for that eventuality?

392
00:23:39,333 --> 00:23:42,041
We owe the students
from Hanzo Academy a great deal,

393
00:23:42,125 --> 00:23:44,666
and we only came to this dumb
tournament to repay a favor!
