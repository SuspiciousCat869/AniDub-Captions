Not thinkin'.
Only attacking anythin' that

324
00:19:06,875 --> 00:19:09,000
gets in their way.
So why aren't they

325
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:11,500
killing each other
all the time, eh?

326
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:14,833
Clearly, they have a way
of telling friend from foe

327
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,750
that doesn't depend on
their mediocre eyesight.

328
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:23,083
See this? It emits
pheromones that signify

329
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:25,583
a creature should
not be targeted.

330
00:19:26,958 --> 00:19:28,583
[HUNTER] That's why
they ignored me after

331
00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,625
I got covered in EI guts.

332
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:34,000
Chemically speaking, they
thought I was one of them.

333
00:19:35,041 --> 00:19:37,291
If we can spray them
with more of this negating

compound I made on the fly.

[gasps] Brilliant!
Let's take it to Cyx.

Uh!

[JACK] Wha--? There?

341
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:09,291
[JACK] But that's just...
the rookie.

342
00:20:09,375 --> 00:20:12,500
You're telling me to go to her?

343
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:19,416
[REAL JACK] Yes. It is essential
that she not perish now.

344
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:22,541
[REAL JACK] Defend her.

345
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:26,291

That's a change of plans.

Suck on my science, bitches!

Son-of-a-bitch! When did
I become a damn taxicab?

Congratulations.
I guess you win the bet.

What?

[JACK] Looks like I got
somewhere else to be.

[GERONIMO] Excuse me? We're
in the middle of a battle!

Don't be cross. When
my E-Gene points the way,

all I can do is take wing.
