331
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:32,916
Source gene from 1582!

332
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:37,875
Sphere 13 at 90 percent.

333
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:39,416
95 percent.

334
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:40,875
105.

335
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,708
110!

336
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,583
It's off the charts!

337
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:47,875
Well, what do you know?

338
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:49,875
She's one of us.

339
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,875
I remember.

340
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,000
All of it.

341
00:20:05,625 --> 00:20:07,708
[DOGOO]
Rest assured, Nobunaga.

342
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:10,500
Your essence
shall be nobly used.

343
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:12,541
My purpose holds
to create warriors

344
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:16,166
fit to embody the
inimitable Nobunaga legacy.

345
00:20:18,833 --> 00:20:21,416
This orb shall
respond only to them,

346
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,125
forming the substance
of whatever improbable weapon

347
00:20:24,208 --> 00:20:27,000
lay closest to
their hearts.

348
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:29,125
Such are the
lengths I must go

349
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:32,500
to protect your world
from its enemies.

350
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,333
What manner of weapon

351
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,958
will your inheritor choose
when the time comes?

352
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:43,041
Hah! Is it not
perfectly obvious?

353
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:02,541
A gun!

354
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,458
Nobunaga?

355
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:08,000
Is that you?

356
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:11,875
All right, girl.

357
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:15,208
So who are you now?

358
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:16,916
Nobunagun.

359
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,125
[JACK]
'Kay.

360
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:20,000
That's a new one.

361
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:30,208
[NOBUNAGA} Hear me,
heir to my immortal soul.

362
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:32,541
When the fateful day comes,

363
00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,750
let no enemy escape
the fires of your wrath!

364
00:23:20,291 --> 00:23:21,416
Gandhi to HQ.

365
00:23:21,500 --> 00:23:24,125
ETA in Kaohsiung
approximately sixty seconds.

366
00:23:24,208 --> 00:23:25,875
Sounds like Jack
is in bad shape,

367
00:23:25,958 --> 00:23:27,375
so I will pull out
all the stops.

368
00:23:27,458 --> 00:23:28,333
Over.

369
00:23:28,416 --> 00:23:29,500
Copy that.

370
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,916
Be advised an
unregistered E-Gene Holder

371
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,333
has just come into play.

372
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,041
Code name: Nobunagun.

373
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,958
A mysterious outside party's
joining us in the fray, Newton.

374
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,791
Care to bet on
whether it's a hot girl?

375
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:41,708
[NEWTON] Damn it, Gandhi.

376
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,083
Focus on the task at hand

377
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:46,541
or so help me I will
crush your balls into pulp!

378
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,416
I love your style...
so visceral!
