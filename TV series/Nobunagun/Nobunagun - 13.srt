1
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:20,625
Wha--?

2
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,458
There?

3
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:29,958
Never thought you'd catch me

4
00:00:30,041 --> 00:00:32,833
"in the altogether,"
so to speak.

5
00:00:35,333 --> 00:00:38,208
I call it Nightingale Mode.

6
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:16,458
Wow.

7
00:02:16,541 --> 00:02:18,250
So wings and everything, huh?

8
00:02:25,625 --> 00:02:29,500
[groaning and panting]

9
00:02:29,583 --> 00:02:31,166
Help me!

10
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,375
Someone, please!

11
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:55,208
[DOGOO]
Florence Nightingale.

12
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:57,291
I would
offer you tea,

13
00:02:57,375 --> 00:03:00,041
but I fear
there's none to be had.

14
00:03:00,125 --> 00:03:03,208
I am not here to partake
in refreshment, madam.

15
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:07,250
I have come to collect
your essence, so to speak.

16
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:08,666
My essence?

17
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:10,000
Ah, of course.

18
00:03:10,083 --> 00:03:12,166
I take it this has
to do with the voice.

19
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:14,250
Correct.

20
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:17,916
How long it's been
since first I heard it.

21
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,208
I was a maiden of 34 then.

22
00:03:20,291 --> 00:03:23,250
The year was 1853.

23
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,958
A disembodied voice beseeched me

24
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:30,041
to ease the suffering of those
wounded in the Crimean War,

25
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:34,708
and so began my
fabled career in medicine.

26
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:36,208
I came to understand

27
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:38,125
that the welfare
of future generations

28
00:03:38,208 --> 00:03:42,083
hinged upon my doing
as the voice bade me.

29
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:44,375
[DOGOO] "Low in
that house of misery

30
00:03:44,458 --> 00:03:46,041
a lady with
a lamp I see

31
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:47,666
pass through the
glimmering gloom,

32
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,666
and flit from
room to room."

33
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,375
A foolish poem.

34
00:03:51,458 --> 00:03:53,916
The voice does
not speak in verse.

35
00:03:56,500 --> 00:04:00,541
Help me! I feel
as if I'm on fire!

36
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:02,250
I am sorry.

37
00:04:02,333 --> 00:04:03,958
Forgive me.

38
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:18,625
Its latest appeal
is far from poetic.

39
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:28,750
Hullo, Agent
Nightingale.

40
00:04:28,833 --> 00:04:30,541
Drop the
"Agent" nonsense.

41
00:04:30,625 --> 00:04:32,500
I've been
neither eyes nor ears

42
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,083
to the Crown for
many years now.

43
00:04:35,666 --> 00:04:36,958
Poor girl's organs
were thriving

44
00:04:37,041 --> 00:04:38,750
with a species
of bacteria

45
00:04:38,833 --> 00:04:40,833
similar to
Streptococcus pyogenes,

46
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,375
though of
unknown origin.

47
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:44,416
Doctor Moreau
agrees with you

48
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:46,458
that the strain
is likely man-made.

49
00:04:46,541 --> 00:04:49,083
So a biological weapon?

50
00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,208
Quite.

51
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:54,041
An 'orrific,
no-prisoners stratagem.

52
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:55,583
Gads.

53
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:57,791
The mind recoils from what may
well have befallen this country.

54
00:04:57,875 --> 00:04:59,041
Left unchecked,

55
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:02,125
it would've carved
a swath all 'cross Europe.

56
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,041
Yet how in the name
of all that's holy

57
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,500
did she come by the disease
in the first place?

58
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:10,250
Poverty compels these poor
souls to submit to horrors.

59
00:05:10,333 --> 00:05:12,958
Over half the children
in her neighborhood

60
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,208
die before the age of 5.

61
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:16,833
Suppose yourself destitute,

62
00:05:16,916 --> 00:05:19,958
scrabbling for bread
and shelter day upon day.

63
00:05:20,041 --> 00:05:21,916
Would not the prospect
of money gained

64
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,500
by acting a guinea pig
be irresistible?

65
00:05:24,583 --> 00:05:26,750
One can hardly condemn them.

66
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:27,958
Yes, well.

67
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,375
Mercifully the tide
has been stemmed, wot.

68
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,541
4 women-- into whom
the disease was injected--

69
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,500
walk the streets still.

70
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,333
How can you know that?

71
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:41,958
Your capacity for belief would
be sorely tested were I to say.

72
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,125
But be that as it will,

73
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:49,375
I promise the carriers
shall be found.

74
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:50,833
[DOGOO] You obeyed
the voice as before;

75
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,500
located the women

76
00:05:52,583 --> 00:05:55,083
and rendered the infected
organs innocuous.

77
00:05:55,166 --> 00:05:56,625
Indeed.

78
00:05:56,708 --> 00:05:59,000
The voice affords me
intimate knowledge

79
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:00,625
of the carrier's condition,

80
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:05,666
that I may excise only
those organs so corrupt.

81
00:06:06,083 --> 00:06:07,583
So the Terror
of Whitechapel

82
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:09,750
is in fact
endeavoring to spare

83
00:06:09,833 --> 00:06:13,375
mankind an even
greater terror.

84
00:06:13,458 --> 00:06:16,250
Happily both terrors
end tonight.

85
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:23,041
Mary Kelly is the last
of the infected?

86
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:26,375
The corruption perishes
by fire as we speak.

87
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:27,958
Heaven only knows the storm

88
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,750
of mad scribblings about
to flood the Penny Dreadfuls,

89
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:34,791
claiming authorship of these
acts, but one thing is certain.

90
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:37,666
My sins will
forever be attributed

91
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:40,708
to a name dreamt up by another.

92
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:44,708
A fitting name,
but pure fiction, nonetheless.

93
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:47,041
The Light Bearer
could only minister

94
00:06:47,125 --> 00:06:50,000
to these wretched souls
as an agent of death,

95
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:54,458
and for that, must bear
her guilt in darkness.

96
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,125
You have endured much,
Florence Nightingale.

97
00:06:57,208 --> 00:07:01,500
But your essence will ensure the
horrors have not been in vain.

98
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:03,000
So you say.

99
00:07:03,083 --> 00:07:06,625
But beware, the Voice entreats
when and where it pleases.

100
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:10,166
My inheritors will
no more be able to predict

101
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:14,208
what it would have
them do-- than could I.

102
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,583
Bloody hell.

103
00:07:17,666 --> 00:07:19,291
This power only fires up

104
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:21,041
when mankind is on
the brink of extinction, yeah?

105
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,625
Fantastic.

106
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,416
That means she's the hinge!

107
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:36,541
Well, que sera sera!

108
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:39,375
Look alive!

109
00:07:39,458 --> 00:07:41,000
I need you to back me up!

110
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,208
Do what?

111
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,333
Uh.

112
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:46,375
Whatever you're 'bout to do,
please clue me in!

113
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,666
Bang up job saving me,
by the way!

114
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,708
Come on, Nightingale.

115
00:07:54,791 --> 00:07:58,041
Show Jacky Boy
the point of crisis, yeh?

116
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:00,583
Show me where
to focus my energy.

117
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,416
That's the way.

118
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,416
Point me to the chink
in this bastard's armor.

119
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,041
I spy, with me little eye.

120
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,750
Gotcha!

121
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:13,291
Oi!

122
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:14,666
Get the Commander online!

123
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,125
Huh?

124
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,958
What's going on out there?

125
00:08:18,041 --> 00:08:19,916
I don't know, ma'am;
monitors are down!

126
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,166
We picked up a signal
just before losing contact;

127
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:26,125
a ping from Genetic Era 1888
on AU Sphere 13.

128
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,291
Let us hope that's a good omen.

129
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,458
Commander!

130
00:08:29,541 --> 00:08:30,666
Nobunagun!

131
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:32,666
Status report, immediately!

132
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:34,583
Uh, things are good.

133
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,791
We need the tanks
to help out

134
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,291
with some concentrated
fire, though.

135
00:08:38,375 --> 00:08:41,625
Would you mind tellin' 'em to
aim for the sensor on pod K-6?

136
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:43,208
What in heaven's name?

137
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,708
Trust me, ma'am.

138
00:08:44,791 --> 00:08:47,708
The Battleship
Type's goin' down!

139
00:08:58,083 --> 00:08:59,541
Oh my word.

140
00:08:59,625 --> 00:09:00,375
Whoa!

141
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:02,333
Heads up!

142
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:05,833
The Transport Types are
moving the base cell cache!

143
00:09:05,916 --> 00:09:06,833
Eh.

144
00:09:06,916 --> 00:09:08,166
Don't worry about it.

145
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:10,791
Soldier Types
can't tell who's who.

146
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:14,583
Seriously?

147
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:16,041
Now you give us a new one?

148
00:09:16,125 --> 00:09:18,208
It appears to be guarding
the Transport Types.

149
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,833
You're kidding, right?

150
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,583
They just waste whatever comes

151
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:27,875
within striking
distance of their mates.

152
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:31,875
Pheromones don't mean
a damn thing to them!

153
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,166
Yeah, so?

154
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,166
Big deal.

155
00:09:34,250 --> 00:09:36,208
We do what we came here to do.

156
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,500
--Let's go!
--Yeah!

157
00:09:54,958 --> 00:09:56,958
Hold this.

158
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:07,750
Open fire!

159
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:11,666
Incoming!

160
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,416
Hold on for dear life.

161
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:39,166
Leave this area to me!

162
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:48,666
Don't just stand there!

163
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,916
This behemoth's brain
should be dead ahead!

164
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,708
Blow it to hell.

165
00:10:54,791 --> 00:10:56,125
You got it!

166
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,541
Gaudí!

167
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,541
I want this thing
rooted to the spot!

168
00:11:33,208 --> 00:11:35,208
Roger!

169
00:12:06,541 --> 00:12:08,708
Well, lookie here.

170
00:12:11,375 --> 00:12:13,708
The floor's yours, Princess!

171
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,125
Moment of truth, people.

172
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:21,916
Go!

173
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:53,583
That poor girl.

174
00:12:54,041 --> 00:12:56,083
Battleship Type
confirmed inactive!

175
00:12:56,166 --> 00:12:57,916
And what of Nobunagun?

176
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,916
I'm on it, ma'am!

177
00:13:21,750 --> 00:13:24,625
Uh. Okay.

178
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:26,625
Bloody hell.

179
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:29,041
Video feed's coming back.

180
00:13:29,125 --> 00:13:31,708
Onscreen now.

181
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,875
It's Nobunagun
and Jack the Ripper!

182
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:37,583
They both look okay!

183
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,166
That's how it's done!

184
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:47,750
Um. Excuse me.

185
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:49,125
This is Hunter.

186
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,583
Y'know, Hunter with Special Ops.

187
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:53,458
So, right. Uh.

188
00:13:53,541 --> 00:13:57,375
I guess, mission accomplished.

189
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,458
Hey, Sio.

190
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:06,000
Rise 'n shine!

191
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,708
Listen, why don't you come

192
00:14:07,791 --> 00:14:09,625
sight-seeing
with me and the gang?

193
00:14:09,708 --> 00:14:11,333
Yeah--Uh.

194
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,000
I-- I'd love to.

195
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,666
I guess I'm just
whatcha'd call a lone wolf.

196
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:17,250
Right.

197
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:19,125
So that big team
mission you planned

198
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,208
and kicked butt
on was all a fluke.

199
00:14:21,291 --> 00:14:22,708
That doesn't count.

200
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,125
Now that the whole thing's over,

201
00:14:24,208 --> 00:14:26,625
it's back to being
Miss Awkward Girl.

202
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,083
Quit pretending you're alone.

203
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:29,500
Huh?

204
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,250
Look around you, silly.

205
00:14:33,083 --> 00:14:37,041
Well, wake up first,
then look around you.

206
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:52,250
If you say so.

207
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,166
Oh. Hello.

208
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:04,625
Cyx, right?

209
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:06,333
The name's Erdenebileg.

210
00:15:06,416 --> 00:15:08,791
Ibukigiin Erdenebileg.

211
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,041
Call me Esui.

212
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,333
Ah. Esui.

213
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,083
Got it.

214
00:15:14,708 --> 00:15:16,458
Sorry! Sorry!

215
00:15:16,541 --> 00:15:17,708
So sorry!

216
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:20,083
You are a piece
of work, young lady.

217
00:15:20,166 --> 00:15:21,125
Huh?

218
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:23,208
By the way, my congratulations.

219
00:15:23,291 --> 00:15:27,416
That said.

220
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,666
Twice, twice I was
forced into letting

221
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
someone other than
the Princess ride my ass.

222
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,541
Since I was so
unduly violated,

223
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:38,875
you must now pay
the price in kind.

224
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:42,166
Uh, could you maybe not--

225
00:15:42,250 --> 00:15:42,958
Dollface!

226
00:15:43,041 --> 00:15:43,708
Um.

227
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,750
Hello, Miss Beckham!

228
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,125
Oh darling, please; it's Jess.

229
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,291
Anyhoo.

230
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:49,000
Would now be a good
time for girl talk?

231
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,708
I have one or two grievances
that need airing out.

232
00:15:51,791 --> 00:15:53,541
Considering the hell
you put me through.

233
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:57,416
No!

234
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,166
Leggo o' me!

235
00:15:58,250 --> 00:15:59,166
What are you doing?

236
00:15:59,250 --> 00:16:00,291
Put me down!

237
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:01,375
This is cruel and
unusual punishment!

238
00:16:01,458 --> 00:16:02,541
Let's get you
cleaned up, shall we?

239
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:03,666
Oo, that's a marvelous idea!

240
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:04,375
You wash our backs,
we'll wash yours.

241
00:16:04,458 --> 00:16:07,500
That is one lucky girl.

242
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:09,000
She'd disagree.

243
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:11,541
They're gonna scrub her good;

244
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:12,666
just you wait and see.

245
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,083
What?

246
00:16:14,166 --> 00:16:17,875
Like I said,
if you want cinéma vérité,

247
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,833
you stick with analog.

248
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:23,500
Invasion of privacy!

249
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:26,125
What the hell?

250
00:16:26,208 --> 00:16:27,166
I believe you forgot about

251
00:16:27,250 --> 00:16:28,750
the gentleman's
wager we had goin'.

252
00:16:28,833 --> 00:16:30,750
'bout who could drop
the most enemy combatants.

253
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,708
How many'd you get, LeMond?

254
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:34,916
Uh. Hm.

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,333
1,002.

256
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:38,041
And you, Adam?

257
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,958
997, give 'r take.

258
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:46,583
But that leaves at least 2,00
dead EI's unaccounted for!

259
00:16:46,666 --> 00:16:49,833
Right, they were mine.

260
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,333
Ugh.

261
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,666
Now, if I recall correctly,
the stakes were kinda high.

262
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:56,666
Winner gets to call
the shots for a day.

263
00:17:00,583 --> 00:17:03,000
The Gunboat Types outside
Sydney have been eliminated.

264
00:17:03,083 --> 00:17:05,208
Fourth Platoon heading
back to the Joji Atsumi.

265
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,208
Operation successful.

266
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:08,416
3rd Platoon signing off.

267
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:11,291
Fifth Platoon
returning to headquarters.

268
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,833
To be cautiously optimistic,
I'd say we're victorious.

269
00:17:14,916 --> 00:17:16,291
It seems so.

270
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,875
Deprived of its base cell cache,
the enemy is neutered.

271
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:25,583
EI's must now evolve,
as it were, from scratch.

272
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:28,041
And so they will, with renewed
fervor, we can be sure.

273
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,541
Likely as not a land invasion
will be their first priority.

274
00:17:31,625 --> 00:17:34,750
See to it the Holders
get their rest.

275
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:37,291
Yes. Of course.

276
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:41,750
I don't believe it!

277
00:17:41,833 --> 00:17:43,541
You actually came to visit me!

278
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:48,083
Oh, the rest of
you guys are here, too.

279
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:48,958
Wow.

280
00:17:49,041 --> 00:17:50,333
It's been so lonely.

281
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,250
No one came to see me
before the operation

282
00:17:52,333 --> 00:17:54,000
and this place gimme the creeps.

283
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,916
Ah, listen to me ramble.

284
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,250
It's good to see you!

285
00:17:58,333 --> 00:18:00,125
You would'na believe
how dodgy it was!

286
00:18:00,208 --> 00:18:02,875
Adam and LeMond were
totally down for the count.

287
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:04,666
They'da been dead without me!

288
00:18:04,750 --> 00:18:07,125
Right?

289
00:18:07,208 --> 00:18:08,750
Uh yeah.

290
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,958
If he hadn't been there,
we'd both be pushin' up daisies.

291
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,333
To think I'd underestimated
Hunter all this time

292
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,833
only to have the bloke save our
bacon like no one's business.

293
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,166
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

294
00:18:19,250 --> 00:18:21,375
Given time, anybody woulda
cracked the pheromone code;

295
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,916
--So, exactly how long
--It just happened to be me.

296
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,041
are we meant to let him
ham it up like this?

297
00:18:25,125 --> 00:18:27,125
Sorry.

298
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,333
Normally when I get
fed up with someone bragging,

299
00:18:29,416 --> 00:18:30,875
I'm pretty good at hiding it;

300
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,375
guess being cooped up in
a hospital makes it difficult

301
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,541
to pretend you're not bugging
the crap out of me right now.

302
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:36,541
Oops.

303
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,458
I'll be back to myself soon.

304
00:18:38,541 --> 00:18:41,125
Aye. Everyone's got
their breaking point.

305
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,250
Haha!

306
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:46,875
Fact is, we would not
have had a prayer of success

307
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,291
had you not risked your life

308
00:18:48,375 --> 00:18:49,708
collecting the data
on those samples.

309
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,625
Merci.

310
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:53,166
[giggling]

311
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,125
You're so sweet to me!

312
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,125
Ow, my tears are all sting-y.

313
00:18:58,208 --> 00:18:59,208
Now, now.

314
00:18:59,291 --> 00:19:01,500
Forgive my getting
so emotional, sir.

315
00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,375
You're forgiven.

316
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:08,541
The hell d'you want?

317
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,375
But, yeah.

318
00:19:09,458 --> 00:19:11,083
Your strategy was so clever.

319
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,000
How the Holders were paired
off to play to their strengths;

320
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:16,208
the ingenious use
of tanks and descent pods.

321
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,750
Only you could've
come up with it!

322
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,541
Uh.

323
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:32,500
You and I need to talk.

324
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,750
So what's on your mind, rookie?

325
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,958
The whole thing
with the Battleship Type.

326
00:19:40,041 --> 00:19:42,291
Right. My form.

327
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:44,958
Thanks for not blabbing
about it to the Commander.

328
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:47,166
She doesn't need to know.

329
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:48,583
Huh?

330
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,375
Word got out Jack the Ripper
was really you-know-who,

331
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:53,416
the backlash would be hell.

332
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:57,125
The only ones in on it
are you, me, and the alien.

333
00:19:57,208 --> 00:19:58,958
I prefer to keep it that way.

334
00:19:59,041 --> 00:20:00,833
That's not what I wanted to--

335
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,291
No?

336
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:06,125
Well I-- y'see--

337
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:08,083
Out with it.

338
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:10,875
I just wanted to thank you
for saving me, all right?

339
00:20:10,958 --> 00:20:13,666
It was a really
nice thing to do.

340
00:20:14,208 --> 00:20:16,666
Ugh. Why'd you have
steal my thunder?

341
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:18,583
Not like I was trying
to have a moment here.

342
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,083
I saved you--

343
00:20:21,166 --> 00:20:23,125
'Cause you mean
the world to me.

344
00:20:28,166 --> 00:20:29,958
There's a voice in
me head, y'understand.

345
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:32,083
Told me you
needed rescuing.

346
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:35,125
See, that voice only pipes up

347
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,500
when humanity's
in serious trouble.

348
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,458
As in, if I hadn't saved you,
we were all doomed.

349
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,750
Now, I don't know about you,

350
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,625
but I'm rather
fond of being alive,

351
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:47,416
so, at that moment you
literally meant the world to me.

352
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:48,500
Right.

353
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:51,041
Of course.

354
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,541
Makes a lot more sense.

355
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:56,333
Look, I just do
what the voice says.

356
00:20:56,416 --> 00:20:57,250
Is what it is.

357
00:20:57,333 --> 00:20:59,666
He just does
what the voice says.

358
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,541
Nothing to it but that.

359
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:03,083
Yeah.

360
00:21:03,166 --> 00:21:04,375
What'd I expect?

361
00:21:04,458 --> 00:21:05,666
I mean.

362
00:21:05,750 --> 00:21:07,625
What other
motive would he have?

363
00:21:07,708 --> 00:21:09,833
Right?

364
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:10,833
It's just me.

365
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:14,666
Just li'l ol' me.

366
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,666
Wow.

367
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,666
I was really
excited there for a sec.

368
00:21:19,708 --> 00:21:21,041
Listen, Sio.

369
00:21:21,125 --> 00:21:24,708
There's something
I have to do.

370
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:26,375
Yeah?

371
00:21:47,291 --> 00:21:48,500
And just so you know,

372
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:51,875
that lil voice had
nothin' to do with that.

373
00:22:00,541 --> 00:22:03,291
Oh bloody hell--!

374
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,541
Don't look at me!
