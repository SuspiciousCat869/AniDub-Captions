00:00:24,708 --> 00:00:27,791

to the Atlantic Ocean.

[DOGOO] Go on, then.

As we have already
successfully deduced,

8
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:38,416
their Florida gambit was
based on their Taiwan defeat.

00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,875

00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,666
[VIDOCQ] The next step was
to push said data through a

a rate-of-speed filter,

Here's every conceivable
ocean transmission route.

However, even the
shortest sea-route available

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:23,375
would not allow for the info
to reach Florida so quickly.

[COMMANDER] Which means--

to skip it altogether?

they can reach the Atlantic
