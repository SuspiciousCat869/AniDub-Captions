00:00:49,125 --> 00:00:51,041
What the hell
are we dealing with?

4
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,125
It's right under
the Halsey, Captain!

00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,000
Is that a--?

[COMMANDER] This EI has
assumed a curious form.

[MALE OP B] The US Navy
is taking heavy losses,

12
00:01:32,875 --> 00:01:36,125
but they do not want
E-Gene Holders deployed, ma'am.

13
00:01:36,208 --> 00:01:38,875
Why is that, I wonder?

14
00:01:38,958 --> 00:01:40,916
[rapid gunfire]

16
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:11,208
It's right in front of me,
but I don't believe it!

[NARRATOR] "E-genes":
recombinant DNA strands

18
00:02:21,583 --> 00:02:23,916
marked by their ability to
retain and selectively manifest

19
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,166
the essence of
humanity's greatest figures.

Known as E-Gene Holders,

the inheritors of
these specialized strands

22
00:02:30,708 --> 00:02:32,541
use AU spheres to
activate the abilities

23
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:36,166
lying dormant within themselves,
which then materialize

24
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:39,458
as physical weapons
of varying types.

25
00:02:39,541 --> 00:02:41,833
What follows is a record
of the struggle between DOGOO,

26
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:43,958
a supranational organization

27
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,583
comprised of
trained E-Gene Holders,

28
00:02:45,666 --> 00:02:49,291
and mankind's greatest threat,
the Evolutionary Invaders.

29
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,916
Make no mistake:
the battle is on!

30
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,375
Gun Seven: "Musashi Wonder"!

31
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:32,916
You guys!

32
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,791
That's totally
the Battleship Yamato!

33
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:36,875
But how come the EIs
hauled it back up like that?

34
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:38,208
Oh, y'know what, though?

35
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:40,333
The Yamato sank way
closer to Japan than here.

36
00:04:40,416 --> 00:04:43,000
C'mon, self!

37
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,291
She's what they
call an "otaku," yes?

38
00:04:45,375 --> 00:04:45,916
No freakin' way!

39
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Huh?

40
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:48,541
This one is the Musashi,
not the Yamato!

41
00:04:48,625 --> 00:04:50,416
The Yamato had
more anti-aircraft guns,

42
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,875
and the plating
on her hull was....

43
00:04:54,958 --> 00:04:59,291
So, yeah. I guess
it's the Musashi?

44
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:00,625
Unless it's not!

45
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,416
1940s warships have
never really been my thing.

46
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:05,750
So, maybe it is the Yamat--

47
00:05:05,833 --> 00:05:06,583
You don't know!

48
00:05:06,666 --> 00:05:07,833
We get it!
Just stop!

49
00:05:07,916 --> 00:05:09,291
Huh?

50
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:13,708
I'm gonna shut up now.

51
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:16,208
[COMMANDER]
The EI apparently intends

52
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:18,500
to leave the Pacific Ocean
for the waters of the Atlantic,

53
00:05:18,583 --> 00:05:20,583
via the Panama Canal.

54
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,291
The US Navy is
thinking with its ego.

55
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:25,666
They'll sink it or die trying.

56
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,625
Why do they care
who sinks it?

57
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:30,291
It's a point of
professional honor.

58
00:05:30,375 --> 00:05:32,250
To have an Imperial Navy
battleship en route

59
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,333
to the Panama Canal
is still a slap in the face.

60
00:05:35,416 --> 00:05:36,500
Oh, that's right.

61
00:05:36,583 --> 00:05:38,208
In World War Two,

62
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:41,000
Japan was planning to
try and destroy the canal.

63
00:05:41,083 --> 00:05:42,833
Hang out!

64
00:05:42,916 --> 00:05:45,083
But the Musashi's way too big

65
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,458
to sail through
the canal, isn't it?

66
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:47,875
They designed it
to be larger than

67
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,125
the U.S. warships
going through Panama, so--

68
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:52,333
You're partially
correct.

69
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:54,375
But history has
passed you by.

70
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:57,125
The canal can handle even
Yamato-class battleships now.

71
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,666
Wha--? When did that happen?

72
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,291
That aside, the Navy
can't have forgotten

73
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,375
their conventional
weaponry doesn't do anything

74
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:06,791
to an EI but
thoroughly piss it off.

75
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:08,333
If nothing else kills it,

76
00:06:08,416 --> 00:06:11,333
they've warned that a nuclear
attack is not off the table.

77
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:14,291
They'd actually nuke it?

78
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:16,000
My god.

79
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:17,166
[DOGOO] A swarm of Invaders

80
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,083
tied the remains of
that ship back together,

81
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:21,458
for a purpose at
which we can only surmise.

82
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,833
There's no reason
to think a nuclear blast

83
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,208
would destroy the EIs,

84
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,416
but that won't stop
the U.S. from trying.

85
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:29,625
But that's barbaric!

86
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:30,750
I quite agree!

87
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:32,250
What if the blast
causes them

88
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:32,916
to mutate in
unexpected ways?

89
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,625
Listen to me!

90
00:06:35,708 --> 00:06:39,875
Musashi deserves better!

91
00:06:39,958 --> 00:06:41,375
Right then.

92
00:06:41,458 --> 00:06:43,708
Sentiment aside, we cannot
allow them the nuclear option.

93
00:06:43,791 --> 00:06:48,666
We prevent that by
sinking the ship ourselves.

94
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:50,708
That is not what I had in mind.

95
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:53,958
Message from HQ: "For
the duration of the mission,

96
00:06:54,041 --> 00:06:57,875
the target's call sign
will be 'Musashi Wonder.'"

97
00:06:57,958 --> 00:06:59,000
So, "Musashi Wonder."

98
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:01,166
Time to hatch
a plan that will let

99
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:05,500
our American friends save
face on the world stage.

100
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:08,500
Galileo.

101
00:07:08,583 --> 00:07:10,208
Give me something to work with.

102
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:11,958
Don't fret, Signore Vidocq--
I'm on the case!

103
00:07:12,041 --> 00:07:13,458
All right!

104
00:07:13,541 --> 00:07:14,291
Io!

105
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:14,875
Europa!

106
00:07:14,958 --> 00:07:15,458
Ganymede!

107
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:16,916
Callisto!

108
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,916
Off you go, little moons!

109
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,166
The U.S. Navy is gearing up
for a nuclear strike.

110
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,583
Second Platoon is onboard
the Clayton Forrester.

111
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:40,583
Special Ops team,
report to the briefing room.

112
00:07:42,375 --> 00:07:43,000
Look what I found!

113
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:44,666
A buncha eggs!

114
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,125
Ew, that's disgusting!

115
00:07:46,208 --> 00:07:48,250
Lemme guess,
we gotta break those,

116
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:50,375
before we deep-six the ship.

117
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:52,833
No room for negotiation
on that, I fear.

118
00:07:52,916 --> 00:07:54,875
We can't allow
the eggs to be scattered.

119
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:57,333
I'll stomp 'em
all flat, don't worry.

120
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,083
But what's the plan for the MW?

121
00:07:59,166 --> 00:08:04,333
The small Colony Types

122
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:08,333
iverse tasks.

123
00:08:08,416 --> 00:08:10,583
Not only have they
mastered the onboard guns,

124
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:12,875
they propel the ship
in lieu of a working engine,

125
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:14,291
and do reconnaissance.

126
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,208
Man, when did they get so smart?

127
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:19,541
If you want smarts,
go up the chain-of-command.

128
00:08:19,625 --> 00:08:20,916
Huh?

129
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,375
I get it.

130
00:08:22,458 --> 00:08:24,833
They're the hoi polloi,

131
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,666
just bending their
knee to the ol' monarch.

132
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:27,708
So to speak.

133
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:28,083
Wait.

134
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,833
What?

135
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:32,208
There's a smart one, okay?

136
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,916
It's the brains
of the operation;

137
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,125
all the others are just gofers.

138
00:08:38,208 --> 00:08:40,375
The EIs aboard that
ship are like stem cells,

139
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,083
vast potential
without any inherent goal.

140
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:45,208
Somewhere within
the Musashi Wonder,

141
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:47,291
there lurks a self-aware core,
which dictates its actions.

142
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:53,500
Put that core to the sword, and
the whole colony will collapse.

143
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,500
Thus the Musashi will return

144
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:58,166
to her status as
a somber war grave.

145
00:08:58,250 --> 00:08:59,875
At which point, of course,

146
00:08:59,958 --> 00:09:03,041
a nuclear attack on America's
part becomes unnecessary.

147
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,166
Another platoon can come in

148
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,041
and destroy
the rest at their leisure.

149
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:06,208
So, Vidocq's saying the Brain-EI

150
00:09:06,291 --> 00:09:06,750
brought the Musashi
back to life, right?

151
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,041
Okay, but why?

152
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,416
So this "core" thing,
what's it look like?

153
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,333
Show the man.

154
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,375
Aye, sir!

155
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,416
This is it.

156
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:20,541
That thing rebuilt
a whole warship?

157
00:09:24,958 --> 00:09:28,375
That is definitely
the Musashi in there.

158
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:30,458
What's this all about then?

159
00:09:30,541 --> 00:09:32,750
I had to show her
the observation data.

160
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:34,583
She wouldn't shut up about it!

161
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,125
If it were a person,

162
00:09:36,208 --> 00:09:39,125
this Brain-EI would be the best
model ship-builder in history!

163
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:41,791
Oh, wow.
That's nice.

164
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,125
It's perfect! And sending it
to the Panama Canal?

165
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:45,458
The core is such a nerd!

166
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,708
Does it make me
a big ol' traitor

167
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:49,125
that I kinda wanna see
it go through the canal?

168
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:51,625
I mean, that'd be cool, right?

169
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,750
Hey, how does the head honcho EI

170
00:09:53,833 --> 00:09:55,666
know so much about the Musashi?

171
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:58,666
It's not really like they
can read our history books.

172
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,416
Look alive, Sio-taku!

173
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,333
Huh?

174
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:02,416
Where're ya going?

175
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,791
The Yanks just
came to their senses.

176
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,666
Time for us to save the day!

177
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,875
So... So we can go?

178
00:10:07,958 --> 00:10:11,583
Does this mean
what I think it means?

179
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:19,208
CVN-74!
The USS John C. Stennis!

180
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,833
Ready, set, go!

181
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,041
Signore Vidocq
convinced the Navy

182
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:27,666
to lend us this ship
because he's so dreamy!

183
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,541
He swore he'd take
down the Musashi Wonder

184
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,125
come hell or high water.

185
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:33,166
Guess it struck a chord.

186
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,041
But we're the ones
stuck doing the dirty work.

187
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,958
You know it.

188
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:42,541
And if we don't take her down
before she reaches the canal,

189
00:10:42,625 --> 00:10:45,041
t'll go from dirty
to radioactive!

190
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:46,500
Quite!

191
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:50,791
So failure is not
an option, my dear.

192
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:57,416
332.8meters was way
too far to run!

193
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:59,125
Dying!

194
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,791
'Suppose you could use a hand.

195
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:05,541
Too late!

196
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,083
Mind's made up!

197
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:07,875
Oh?

198
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:08,666
About what?

199
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,208
I'm gonna sink that ship.

200
00:11:10,291 --> 00:11:12,333
And I'm gonna do it by myself!

201
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,250
Musashi Wonder has entered
the theater of operations.

202
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:23,208
Roger that, Vidocq.

203
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:24,916
Come in, 2nd Platoon.

204
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,166
Are you ready to engage?

205
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:30,291
This is the strike
team up on the Alex Rogan.

206
00:11:30,375 --> 00:11:32,333
We're all good to go, Commander.

207
00:11:36,166 --> 00:11:40,500
Ditto! We're in
place on the John C. Stennis!

208
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:57,041
Ready on your word, ma'am!

209
00:12:08,583 --> 00:12:18,333
These dots are the egg
cluster and the core.

210
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,041
First, you'll destroy
the top of the conning tower

211
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,250
and storm the ship via your pod.

212
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:25,000
Having done that,
you'll then eliminate the eggs.

213
00:12:25,083 --> 00:12:26,916
Finally, you'll strike the core,

214
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:30,125
leading to
the dissolution of the ship.

215
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,166
Jack and Newton,
you're on point.

216
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,333
Nobunagun, you'll blast
open an entrance for the pod.

217
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:37,625
Gandhi, you cover our sniper.

218
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,208
Hey, hold on a sec!

219
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:42,583
I thought AU Weapons only worked
on the creatures themselves!

220
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,708
So won't my bullets
just bounce off,

221
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:46,625
no matter how
many I shoot at it?

222
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,041
Correct.

223
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:49,875
And, adding to our dilemma,

224
00:12:49,958 --> 00:12:53,791
there's a layer
of EIs along the top

225
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:54,875
that are impervious to
all conventional weaponry.

226
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:55,750
Really?

227
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,125
Then how do we break through?

228
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,041
Think about it.

229
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,541
In that case!

230
00:13:04,625 --> 00:13:06,375
I'll start us off!

231
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,791
Nobunagun has opened fire, sir.

232
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:10,875
Good.

233
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,708
Galileo, observe
the point of impact.

234
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:14,500
Yes!

235
00:13:14,583 --> 00:13:15,833
Of course!

236
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,666
Reconfirm our data link
with the US fleet, A-SAP.

237
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,708
Yes, sir.

238
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,666
That conning tower's armor
is 500-millimeters thick!

239
00:13:31,750 --> 00:13:35,958
The density of EIs at our
target point is dropping, Sio!

240
00:13:36,041 --> 00:13:38,500
Shoot that tower to
your heart's content!

241
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:16,083
Incoming!

242
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:17,291
EI concentration
dropping rapidly!

243
00:14:17,375 --> 00:14:18,875
Almost-- almost!

244
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,250
We did it!

245
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:21,958
The tower's clear!

246
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:24,541
You're free to fire at will.

247
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,541
Booyah!

248
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,166
Sorry 'bout that, Musashi.

249
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:05,833
Strike team, go!

250
00:15:07,583 --> 00:15:09,250
Going down.

251
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:25,083
Strike team is on the ship.

252
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:28,000
Follow my probe to the eggs!

253
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,791
Getting warmer.

254
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:51,500
Nothing's gonna
hug my face, right?

255
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:52,583
Whoa!

256
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:53,583
At sea, "no one
can hear you scream."

257
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:53,958
When'd you grow
a sense of humour?

258
00:15:54,041 --> 00:15:54,333
Vidocq!

259
00:15:54,416 --> 00:15:55,166
Come in!

260
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:56,375
I wanna go on the ship, too!

261
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:57,208
They're onboard
so I'm done out here, right?

262
00:15:57,291 --> 00:16:00,000
I suppose.

263
00:16:00,083 --> 00:16:01,916
I should be the Holder
to sink the Musashi!

264
00:16:05,208 --> 00:16:06,708
Here I go.

265
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,875
If you wanna play,
who am I to turn you down?

266
00:16:29,541 --> 00:16:31,833
Don't tell me you
really meant all that!

267
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,916
Hold down the fort.

268
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,458
Orders, sir?

269
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:39,416
Can't turn tail or we'll be
the laughingstock of the world!

270
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,291
Take us right up to her!

271
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,166
Paint to paint, dammit!

272
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,416
Nobunagun just jumped
onto the target, sir!

273
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:05,458
I'll guide her to the EI core!

274
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:07,750
Don't let me down, Galileo.

275
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,583
So, how many eggs left?

276
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,291
Zero, love.

277
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:13,958
No hatchlings, either.

278
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,416
Give Nobunagun some
back-up, would you?

279
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:19,000
She's headed to the core alone.

280
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,916
That dummy needs a babysitter!

281
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,666
Or a leash.

282
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:35,125
Wait. Is that it?

283
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,916
Musashi.

284
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:45,708
You were resting in peace,
until they hauled you back up.

285
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,875
I've spotted the core,
deep within the hold!

286
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,708
I'm taking it down!

287
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:07,541
Are those the Musashi's crew?

288
00:18:07,625 --> 00:18:10,250
Why's the EI all
tangled up in 'em?

289
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,083
These memories.

290
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:35,041
They're not from
the ship itself.

291
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,791
Yes, of course.
They're from the crew!

292
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,125
The EI must've
used those feelings

293
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:42,458
to resurrect the Musashi!

294
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,833
Listen to me!

295
00:18:43,916 --> 00:18:46,083
You don't belong here!

296
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:47,625
Stop the ship!

297
00:18:47,708 --> 00:18:49,208
'Cause if you don't...!

298
00:18:49,291 --> 00:18:53,166
The Navy'll vaporize
it with a tactical nuke.

299
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,625
Don't let Musashi
go out like that.

300
00:18:56,708 --> 00:18:59,625
She deserves better.

301
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,000
The hell's wrong with you?

302
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:12,875
Shoot the damn thing!

303
00:19:12,958 --> 00:19:14,625
Oh, right!

304
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,750
Rest in peace... Musashi!

305
00:19:56,875 --> 00:19:59,416
Musashi Wonder's
hull is breaking up, sir!

306
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:01,708
Where's 2nd Platoon?

307
00:20:03,333 --> 00:20:06,375
All members safely evacuated!

308
00:20:09,416 --> 00:20:12,458
I'm glad I got to meet you.

309
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:17,000
And to your crew-- At ease, men.

310
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,708
Musashi Wonder has sunk
5,000 meters and still dropping!

311
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:38,458
How deep does
the Middle America Trench run?

312
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,291
Ah.

313
00:20:39,375 --> 00:20:42,083
Just shy of 6,700 meters.

314
00:20:42,166 --> 00:20:44,666
Give or take.

315
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:46,458
Our enemy is resilient.

316
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:49,125
But can they survive
at such a depth?

317
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,833
It's difficult to say.

318
00:20:50,916 --> 00:20:52,333
But at the very least,

319
00:20:52,416 --> 00:20:56,583
it will be a struggle for
them to return from the abyss.

320
00:20:57,916 --> 00:20:59,500
Let me get this straight.

321
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,916
The Evolutionary Invaders
encountered the drowned crewmen

322
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,083
of the Musashi sometime
after it sank in 1944.

323
00:21:06,166 --> 00:21:09,500
The EI absorbed the dead
men's resentment at their fate,

324
00:21:09,583 --> 00:21:12,500
and the ship in order
to play out the crew's

325
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:15,583
original goal of
invading the U.S. mainland?

326
00:21:15,666 --> 00:21:18,291
Really.

327
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,250
That's quite the ghost story.

328
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,958
Don't you "quite
the ghost story" me!

329
00:21:22,041 --> 00:21:23,083
I was there!

330
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:27,708
I know what I saw, okay?

331
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:28,375
Galileo!

332
00:21:28,458 --> 00:21:29,833
What's the big idea?

333
00:21:31,125 --> 00:21:34,500
That is the most tragic
bathing suit I 'ave ever seen.

334
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,750
But this is the only
one my mom packed for me!

335
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,541
I didn't know we'd
be going to the beach!

336
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,708
An authentic Japanese
schoolgirl swimsuit!

337
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,125
Hey!

338
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:46,416
I am gonna kill you!

339
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,083
Shio's wearing a one-piece!

340
00:21:48,166 --> 00:21:49,958
C'mon! Give it back!

341
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:53,833
Look at 'em getting along.

342
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,416
Today we gonna find out
who the real gopher is!

343
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:41,833
[GAUDÍ] Wait, why am I here?

344
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:43,458
We gotta make sure
it's a fair fight!

345
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,458
Shut your traps already!

346
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:46,583
All three of you
buy the damn bread!

347
00:23:46,666 --> 00:23:48,000
Aye, sir!

348
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:49,541
Next time, Gun Eight: "Tunnel."

349
00:23:49,625 --> 00:23:52,291
These three are
a pain in the arse.
