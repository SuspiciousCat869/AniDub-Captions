What, really?

00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:40,708
I'm afraid DOGOO observes
a zero tolerance policy

00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,500
vis-à-vis personal communiqués
from within the perimeter.

What a teenage girl
requires to survive

is no longer your concern.

the point of this is again?

Just give me a couple minutes.

00:08:58,375 --> 00:09:01,375
I'm afraid the Commander has
certain expectations of you.

Yes, sir.

124
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:06,250
The effects on
the Holder of activating

125
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:09,500
and engaging his or her
AU weapon are varied.

126
00:09:09,583 --> 00:09:11,541
Determined by the physical

127
00:09:11,625 --> 00:09:13,875
and psychological
constitution of said Holder,

128
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:15,500
the effects range from

00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,666
Sorry; apparently
I've forgotten my manners.

169
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,375
Second Lieutenant
Harold S. Conway!

170
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:07,583
And you're American?

171
00:12:07,666 --> 00:12:09,708
Well, he is;
I'm from Australia, mate!

172
00:12:09,791 --> 00:12:11,625
Canada, born n' raised!

173
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:13,041
Salutations from the homeland!

174
00:12:13,125 --> 00:12:14,791
S'up from the Philippines!

175
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:16,291
Hey!

176
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:17,416
So about that banana.

177
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,541
Dude, give it a rest!

178
00:12:18,625 --> 00:12:19,833
If she wants
anything it's from Japan!

179
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:21,083
I got a crate of Kiwi!

180
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,666
No thanks!

181
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:27,208
Please?

182
00:12:27,291 --> 00:12:28,916
Sorry 'bout that.

183
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:31,458
Meeting the Nobunagun
is kind of big deal,

184
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:33,916
case you couldn't tell.

185
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,625
So, DOGOO pulled you
guys from all over, huh?

186
00:12:36,708 --> 00:12:38,333
Yep; whole
world's in this fight.

187
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:39,875
We don't see
much action, though;

188
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,750
mostly oceanography
and vessel maintenance.

189
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:44,208
When the Alex Rogan needs
refueling, we're the guys.

190
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:46,916
I'm guessing the
Alex Rogan is a ship?

191
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,333
I'm sure you'll
be introduced before long.

192
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:52,375
Huh.

193
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:54,541
This here is the plane
my unit gets to tool around in.

194
00:12:54,625 --> 00:12:57,625
Whoa!

195
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,583
Is that based off a C-130?

196
00:12:59,666 --> 00:13:00,875
Like an HC.

197
00:13:00,958 --> 00:13:02,208
No, SC?

198
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,375
WC-130J, actually.

199
00:13:04,458 --> 00:13:05,791
No friggin' way!

200
00:13:05,875 --> 00:13:07,458
The Hurricane Hunter!

201
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,583
Yeah, you know it?

202
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:09,333
Duh!

203
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,708
Is that even a question?

204
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,541
You're only the high-flying
weather recon team

205
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:15,000
who risks life and limb scaling
Category 5s in this beaut!

206
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:18,208
Well, I don't know if
it's as glamorous as all that.

207
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:21,750
Although, she does
catch serious wind.

208
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:26,000
Of all the places for this

209
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:28,625
glorious piece of
machinery to be hiding.

210
00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:29,500
I know, right?

211
00:13:29,583 --> 00:13:30,625
Who'd a'thunk it?

212
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,291
Backwater outfit like us.

213
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:34,083
Totally not what I meant!

214
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,791
Just, going off the mess hall,
this place is a ghost town.

215
00:13:36,875 --> 00:13:38,375
Must seem like it, I imagine.

216
00:13:38,458 --> 00:13:41,125
We're not really supposed
to eat with you Holders.

217
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:44,833
That doesn't seem too nice.

218
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,583
There're ways around it,
if you want.

219
00:13:46,666 --> 00:13:48,916
I mean, if you wander
down to the commons.

220
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,083
Done!

221
00:14:00,583 --> 00:14:01,958
3 more laps!

222
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,416
Try not to keel over!

223
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:06,583
Gonna die.

224
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,250
No.

225
00:14:09,333 --> 00:14:11,666
Screw that.

226
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,416
Now, a handful
of notable experts

227
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:17,166
believe it's
theoretically possible

228
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,875
for a Holder
to enable their powers

229
00:14:18,958 --> 00:14:20,708
without the aid
of an AU sphere.

230
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,125
However.

231
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:32,375
Your training
regimen is intense.

232
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:34,750
How ya holdin' up?

233
00:14:34,833 --> 00:14:37,625
Well, I am me, so--

234
00:14:37,708 --> 00:14:39,000
Aw, don't talk like that!

235
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:40,666
The fact they brought
you here in the first place

236
00:14:40,750 --> 00:14:43,291
means you're certifiably a
cut above the average soldier.

237
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,916
You just gotta learn
to have a little confidence!

238
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:47,625
D'aw, you're so sweet!

239
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,375
I think somebody
needs a second helping.

240
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:50,166
What?

241
00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:55,708
I've got her covered!

242
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,250
Nobunagun!

243
00:15:00,333 --> 00:15:02,666
Ready to take out the trash!

244
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,250
Tell me.

245
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:07,083
Why exactly do you insist on
calling yourself "Nobunagun"?

246
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:08,666
Huh?

247
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:11,458
Well, a kickass weapon
like this needs a kickass name!

248
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:17,750
Moving on.

249
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,666
Listen, I notice you're making
friendly with the troops.

250
00:15:20,750 --> 00:15:21,833
Oh.

251
00:15:21,916 --> 00:15:23,083
Yeah!

252
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:24,333
Kinda hard not to
when they're all so nice--

253
00:15:24,416 --> 00:15:25,291
Well, don't.

254
00:15:25,375 --> 00:15:26,583
They're shields.

255
00:15:26,666 --> 00:15:27,958
Say what?

256
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,500
Ordinary humans,
civilian or otherwise,

257
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,208
stand a snowball's
chance in hell against an EI.

258
00:15:33,291 --> 00:15:36,375
Only use for a non-Holder
in the field is a decoy.

259
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,750
You don't need
to call 'em that.

260
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,375
Sacrificial pawns
have a better ring?

261
00:15:42,666 --> 00:15:43,958
Can't imagine it does,

262
00:15:44,041 --> 00:15:45,500
considering
the military casualties

263
00:15:45,583 --> 00:15:47,250
you could've
prevented in Taiwan

264
00:15:47,333 --> 00:15:49,041
if you'd summoned
the energy to pick off

265
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:52,000
that last line
of Foot Soldier Types.

266
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:55,333
If you're looking to bond
with fun new people,

267
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:57,250
your priorities need an enema.

268
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,041
We're not here to play.

269
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,333
Yeah.

270
00:16:04,416 --> 00:16:06,250
Show me pissed.

271
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,500
Wha--?

272
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:17,916
Huh?

273
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,125
Like bein' in a funhouse, ja?

274
00:16:22,208 --> 00:16:23,708
Figured you
could use the closure.

275
00:16:23,791 --> 00:16:26,958
You do have only
yourself to be mad at.

276
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,833
Sure, treat 'em like a mirage
if you feel like bein' dead.

277
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:41,583
What?

278
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:42,750
Thought you might be pining

279
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,958
for the familiar
comforts of home.

280
00:16:45,041 --> 00:16:47,041
Since you think
I'm so hard on you.

281
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:49,750
Now make the most of
your home field advantage!

282
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,541
What's taking so long;

283
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,583
they can't be that
much of a challenge.

284
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:58,791
Come on, I'm hungry!

285
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,208
No, jackass;
you're doing it wrong!

286
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,666
Damn it to hell,
aim before you fire!

287
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:06,833
Aiming, right.

288
00:17:06,916 --> 00:17:10,166
If I want quantity over quality,

289
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:11,416
I'll shop wholesale!

290
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,500
You're wasting precious energy!

291
00:17:14,958 --> 00:17:15,833
I got this.

292
00:17:15,916 --> 00:17:17,500
I got this!

293
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,000
Why'm I not hitting 'em?

294
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:22,541
Because that
thing called recoil

295
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:24,625
is wreaking havoc with
your center of gravity!

296
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,708
It's about control!

297
00:17:27,125 --> 00:17:28,333
An AU weapon is an expression

298
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:30,333
of its wielder's
innate capabilities.

299
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,541
Even the bullets depend
on you for their existence.

300
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:37,750
Great!

301
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,125
That's all well and good, but--!

302
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:47,708
I just can't!

303
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:50,500
Chin up, girlie.

304
00:17:50,583 --> 00:17:52,708
This is how we roll.

305
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,166
Give it your all
or I give you mine.

306
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:57,458
A man has his needs.

307
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,500
What the hell's wrong with you?

308
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,125
Hey.

309
00:18:09,208 --> 00:18:10,291
Lookie there.

310
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:12,666
You can actually hit
a motionless target.

311
00:18:13,083 --> 00:18:15,375
Too bad the enemy moves.

312
00:18:15,458 --> 00:18:17,000
You gotta cut
'em off at the pass.

313
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,583
Focus your scope on where
the target is moving to.

314
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,458
Aim ahead of your subject.

315
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:24,541
It's about control.

316
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:28,541
Aim before you shoot.

317
00:18:28,625 --> 00:18:30,416
No full-auto.

318
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:33,208
Focus on where
the target's about to be.

319
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,583
Fire!

320
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,041
No!

321
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:46,666
Miss Ogura!

322
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,041
Um, hey.

323
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:50,458
Thank you for being so awesome!

324
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,291
Whatever I did,
I'm sure it's nothing.

325
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:53,791
Sorry, miss, but I don't call

326
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:55,625
literally taking the shirt
off your back for us "nothing."

327
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:56,750
What now?

328
00:18:56,833 --> 00:18:58,583
Uh.

329
00:18:58,666 --> 00:18:59,375
Wait.

330
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:00,208
I--

331
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:02,166
The hell are those?

332
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,958
First word comes to
my mind is "amazing!"

333
00:19:05,041 --> 00:19:06,833
I'll cherish this
'til the day I die!

334
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:09,791
Dude.

335
00:19:09,875 --> 00:19:12,208
Capa!

336
00:19:12,833 --> 00:19:13,916
What do you want now?

337
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:15,708
Some pointers on crowd control?

338
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:16,541
No!

339
00:19:16,625 --> 00:19:17,666
Explain this!

340
00:19:17,750 --> 00:19:18,583
That?

341
00:19:18,666 --> 00:19:19,875
Nothing.

342
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:21,208
Li'l something I shot
with your doppelgänger.

343
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:23,458
You dig the composition?

344
00:19:23,541 --> 00:19:26,708
Give me film over digital
any day of the week.

345
00:19:26,791 --> 00:19:32,666
Certainly brings a smile
to your comrades' faces, ja?

346
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,333
So now they're comrades, not
shields or sacrificial pawns?

347
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,583
That was just
smack-talk to wake you up.

348
00:19:39,666 --> 00:19:42,875
No one says that about
their brothers and means it.

349
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:43,541
Huh?

350
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,750
You ass!

351
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:50,333
This crap is unacceptable!

352
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:57,666
Right, then.

353
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:58,750
See you later.

354
00:19:58,833 --> 00:19:59,791
Be safe up there, okay?

355
00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:01,791
I'll be rootin' for ya!

356
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,000
So cool.

357
00:20:13,083 --> 00:20:14,375
Speaking of "cool,"

358
00:20:14,458 --> 00:20:17,625
you could stand to take
a page or 2 from those boys.

359
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:18,791
As things are now,

360
00:20:18,875 --> 00:20:20,791
the Commander's
faith in you is timorous.

361
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,791
Today we stick to fundamentals.

362
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,708
Yes, sir.

363
00:20:29,500 --> 00:20:31,000
This is D-101 reporting.

364
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:34,000
We're currently passing
through Mexican airspace.

365
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:35,958
Entering danger zone.

366
00:20:37,333 --> 00:20:39,125
[PILOT 3A]
They call this one Olga.

367
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:41,750
Dang, been a few since
we had a li'l lady this hot.

368
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:45,166
Yeah, but only one
li'l lady's got my heart.

369
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,541
[PILOT 3A] All right,
let's catch some wind!

370
00:20:47,625 --> 00:20:49,208
Roger!

371
00:20:58,833 --> 00:20:59,833
Bogies, sir!

372
00:20:59,916 --> 00:21:02,125
They're riding
on the central winds!

373
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,875
[PILOT 3A] What moron'd put
a fleet in the middle of this?

374
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:08,041
We're blowing at
60 meters a second!

375
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:09,083
Can't identify as
friendly or hostile!

376
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:11,125
No metals detected!

377
00:21:17,666 --> 00:21:18,833
Good god.

378
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:20,458
Don't tell me it's--!

379
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:40,625
[FEMALE OP 1B] Robert Capa!

380
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:41,625
Nobunagun!

381
00:21:41,708 --> 00:21:43,041
Suspend training immediately.

382
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:44,125
What now?

383
00:21:44,208 --> 00:21:45,208
[FEMALE OP 1B]
We have an emergency.

384
00:21:45,291 --> 00:21:46,791
D-101 appears
to have been shot down

385
00:21:46,875 --> 00:21:49,250
over the Gulf of Mexico while
on a hurricane recon mission.

386
00:21:49,333 --> 00:21:50,458
Huh?

387
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:51,541
[FEMALE OP 1B]
A helicopter is standing by.

388
00:21:51,625 --> 00:21:53,416
Both of you are
to board immediately.

389
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:55,500
Repeat: board immediately.

390
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,833
But they--

391
00:22:01,625 --> 00:22:03,125
Please no.

392
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,958
Oi, you heard about
the Hurricane, right?

393
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,500
You talkin' about the kaiju that
looks like a giant jellyfish?

394
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:44,875
Fantastic.

395
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,083
She's an otaku.

396
00:23:46,166 --> 00:23:46,958
What?

397
00:23:47,041 --> 00:23:48,041
Next time.

398
00:23:48,125 --> 00:23:50,125
Gun Four: "Hurricane."

399
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:51,750
I recommend you watch.
