3
00:00:17,791 --> 00:00:18,375
[GERONIMO] It fired?

4
00:00:18,458 --> 00:00:19,416
[NEWTON] It's huge!

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:20,458
[CYX] Is there a warhead?

6
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,791
[JACK] If that goes off!

7
00:00:21,875 --> 00:00:24,000
[GANDHI] It's headed
straight for the Commander!

8
00:00:24,083 --> 00:00:25,458
[SIO grunts]

9
00:00:27,583 --> 00:00:29,625
Ah! What the--?

10
00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:34,166
[SIO] Ahhh!

11
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:35,625
[gasps]

12
00:00:40,791 --> 00:00:43,125
[SIO] Huh.

13
00:00:43,208 --> 00:00:45,291
Okay...

14
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:49,791
[monitor beeping]

15
00:00:49,875 --> 00:00:51,000
I'm home.

00:00:51,083 --> 00:00:52,375
[knock at the door]

17
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:53,833
[SIO] Yeah?

18
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:57,041
Good to have you back with us.

19
00:00:57,125 --> 00:00:59,625
Uh, how long have I been out?

20
00:00:59,708 --> 00:01:02,333
[NARRATOR] "E-genes":
recombinant DNA strands marked

21
00:01:02,416 --> 00:01:05,083
by their ability to retain
and selectively manifest

22
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:08,083
the essence of
humanity's greatest figures.

23
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,541
Known as E-Gene Holders,
the inheritors of

24
00:01:10,625 --> 00:01:13,041
these specialized
strands use AU spheres

25
00:01:13,125 --> 00:01:15,125
to activate the
abilities lying dormant

26
00:01:15,208 --> 00:01:17,541
within themselves,
which then materialize as

27
00:01:17,625 --> 00:01:19,666
physical weapons
of varying types.

28
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,708
What follows is
a record of the struggle

29
00:01:21,791 --> 00:01:24,666
between DOGOO, a supranational
organization comprised of

30
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:27,000
trained E-Gene
Holders, and mankind's

31
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:30,000
greatest threat,
the Evolutionary Invaders.

32
00:01:30,083 --> 00:01:33,125
Make no mistake:
the battle is on!

[SIO]
Gun Nine: "Sio and Kaoru."

34
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,958
[JACK] Japan? Right
bit of overkill, innit?

35
00:03:16,041 --> 00:03:17,791
Not like she's at
death's door or nothin'.

36
00:03:17,875 --> 00:03:19,208
Just a few nicks.

37
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:21,500
[GANDHI] Strange, I grant you,
but it is the result of

38
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:24,041
a direct order from
the Commander herself.

39
00:03:24,125 --> 00:03:25,500
[JACK] Eh?

40
00:03:26,875 --> 00:03:30,458
All told, I am thankful
Sio is better off than some.

41
00:03:30,541 --> 00:03:31,875
[BOTH] Hm?

42
00:03:31,958 --> 00:03:34,500
[GANDHI] There is a very
real possibility Galileo will

43
00:03:34,583 --> 00:03:37,333
never see the
front lines again.

44
00:03:37,416 --> 00:03:41,833
[monitor beeping]

45
00:03:41,916 --> 00:03:43,375
[huffs]

46
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,291
So then what's our next move?

47
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:47,083
That depends on
how Vidocq's meeting

48
00:03:47,166 --> 00:03:48,583
with the brass turns out.

49
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:51,416
[GANDHI] Which is
unfolding as we speak.

50
00:03:52,458 --> 00:03:54,916
I hate being
mentally outgunned.

51
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:57,041
Come now, friend.

52
00:03:57,125 --> 00:03:58,541
No one could
foresee the enemy's--

53
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,458
[JACK] She did.

54
00:04:00,541 --> 00:04:02,125
That's what I mean.

55
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:05,333
Experienced operatives
were bested by a rookie.

56
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,333
[JACK sighs]

57
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:11,291
[VIDOCQ] Take note,
the prevailing features of

58
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,750
these Engineer
Types are arthropoidal.

59
00:04:13,833 --> 00:04:15,583
We presume the
tunnel's construction

60
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,625
depended largely on them.

61
00:04:17,708 --> 00:04:19,458
[VIDOCQ] Also
resembling arthropods are

62
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,166
the Land Mine Types.

63
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,541
So-called for their ability
to self-destruct on contact.

64
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,333
Size varies; here
you see the larger ones.

65
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,791
Their destructive capacity
is roughly equivalent

66
00:04:29,875 --> 00:04:32,500
to that of a
modest nuclear warhead.

67
00:04:32,583 --> 00:04:35,208
Next we have the Battleship
Type, whose chief function

68
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:37,541
appears to be
that of patrol guard.

69
00:04:37,625 --> 00:04:40,458
Being a cephalopod, its
body is uniquely suited to

70
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:42,500
the task of navigating
the maze-like tunnel

71
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:44,291
it's charged to protect.

72
00:04:44,375 --> 00:04:46,750
No less than seven
E-gene Holders from

73
00:04:46,833 --> 00:04:48,791
First and Second
Platoons were dispatched

74
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,666
to engage the Battleship Type.

75
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,250
It overpowered them
as you or I might a fly.

76
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,416
Injuring two and leaving Clayton
Forrester worse for wear;

77
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,291
though her damage is minor.

78
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,750
And, to be fair, more a
product of Second Platoon's

79
00:05:00,833 --> 00:05:02,708
famed Nobunagun, correct?

80
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:05,166
The girl's impeccable timing,
as well as her courage,

81
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:08,041
spared the lives of
every crewmember aboard.

82
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:09,958
Yes. Kudos to her.

83
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,125
[DOGOO]
The injured you mentioned.

84
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:14,833
Nobunagun is one of them, yes?

85
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:18,083
[VIDOCQ] Correct.
But her injuries are minimal.

86
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,250
Thank goodness.
The Commander's all right.

87
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,583
[SAINT-GERMAIN] Your transfer
to a Japanese hospital was

88
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:26,375
ordered by way of a thank you.

89
00:05:26,458 --> 00:05:28,416
Well, that was nice of her.

90
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,208
Oh. That reminds me.

91
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:32,750
Fresh change of
clothes and a small

92
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:34,625
get-well gift
from the Commander.

93
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:36,083
A box of sugared beans.

94
00:05:36,166 --> 00:05:39,875
Wow, that's really nice.
And a super serious box.

95
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:42,708
Their quality is most
exceptional, I assure you.

96
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:44,666
You find the
gift unsatisfactory?

97
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,125
No! I'm sure they're
awesome! I just--

98
00:05:47,208 --> 00:05:49,250
Then enjoy them
at your leisure.

99
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:51,375
The doctors are hopeful.

100
00:05:51,458 --> 00:05:53,375
I am told your
injuries begin and end

101
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:55,125
with a bruise
and a sprained ankle.

102
00:05:55,208 --> 00:05:56,791
Tomorrow you'll be
released and taken back

103
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,416
to the Alex Rogan.

104
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,208
Feel free to spend the rest
of the day as you please.

105
00:06:01,291 --> 00:06:02,958
Yes, sir.

106
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,916
[SAINT-GERMAIN] Good afternoon.

107
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,833
Uh!

108
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,875
[sighs]

109
00:06:08,958 --> 00:06:10,833
[grunts]

110
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,375
Oh Japan,
how I've missed you.

111
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:17,375
[SIO] Your fresh air.
Your attitude.

112
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,541
Oh, I should call Mom!

113
00:06:21,583 --> 00:06:24,125
Hold on. I'm in Japan.

114
00:06:24,208 --> 00:06:25,291
[wails]

115
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:27,000
My phone should work!

116
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,875
[phone beeps]

117
00:06:28,958 --> 00:06:31,125
Ahhh!

118
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:35,041
[SIO] Wow.
She really likes to text.

119
00:06:35,125 --> 00:06:35,916
[knock at the door]

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,250
Yeah?

121
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:40,166
Door should be open. C'mon in.

122
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,666
[KAORU] Um, hey there.

123
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,083
Huh?

124
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:47,583
[KAORU] Long time no see,
Sio. And can I just start

125
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,833
by sayin' you look fabulous?

126
00:06:49,916 --> 00:06:53,375
[titters]

127
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,416
[SIO] Oh, Asao!

128
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,541
[chuckles]

129
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,208
I'll take that as
a sign of progress!

130
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:02,750
[DOGOO] Is this not
counterintuitive? EIs evolve.

131
00:07:02,833 --> 00:07:04,916
Why then are
these high-profile types

132
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,416
regressing into
invertebrate form?

133
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,208
It is odd, I grant you.

134
00:07:09,291 --> 00:07:11,208
Up to this point,
the enemy has mimicked,

135
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,375
or appropriated,
forms along the food chain

136
00:07:13,458 --> 00:07:16,583
in a direct, unbroken
line of ascent.

137
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:19,125
[VIDOCQ] Their trajectory
modeled itself on the evolution

138
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,000
of life here on Earth.

139
00:07:22,083 --> 00:07:25,625
Yet the types most recently
encountered betray that model.

140
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:28,000
Having achieved the
oceanic vertebrate stage,

141
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:30,875
they've now chosen a form
which reverses that course,

142
00:07:30,958 --> 00:07:33,916
pushing them back to the
middle of the Paleozoic Era.

143
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,500
I believe the adoption
of older forms indicates a

144
00:07:36,583 --> 00:07:39,250
stockpile of base cells
programmed into the DNA

145
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:42,541
of every EI, regardless
of their evolutionary stage.

146
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:44,833
In other words, their
genome has immediate access

147
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,625
to each phase of
its development and

148
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:49,500
can reintroduce
forms previously discarded.

149
00:07:49,583 --> 00:07:51,333
Is there
supporting evidence?

150
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,750
As a matter of
fact, there is.

151
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,166
[VIDOCQ] Here is a 3D
rendering of the tunnel.

152
00:07:56,250 --> 00:07:58,500
Information that
Galileo courageously

153
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:00,375
risked her life to obtain.

154
00:08:00,458 --> 00:08:02,333
In one of the
tunnel's many chambers,

155
00:08:02,416 --> 00:08:06,791
we detected these base cells
in the belly of an arthropod.

156
00:08:06,875 --> 00:08:10,000
Given that a different EI
Type is guarding this chamber,

157
00:08:10,083 --> 00:08:12,583
we can assume storage and
distribution of these cells

158
00:08:12,666 --> 00:08:15,333
is solely the
domain of said arthropod.

159
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:18,916
A vitally important,
yet defenseless creature.

160
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,750
[VIDOCQ] Bear in mind, also,
the Musashi Wonder incident,

161
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:24,000
in which the strict

Mmm.

478
00:21:51,166 --> 00:21:53,166
[JACK] You birds
done chewin' the fat?

479
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:57,916
Huh? Ah-ah-ah-ah! Y-Y-Y-Yeah.

480
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,333
[JACK] Right then.
'Cause now it's my turn.

481
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:01,833
Huh?

482
00:22:01,916 --> 00:22:05,208
There's somethin'

483
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,541
Huh?

484

[SIO snoring]

485
00:23:39,916 --> 00:23:41,708
[SAINT-GERMAIN] Rise and
shine, poppet. Quickly now.

486
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:44,208
[SIO] What? "Poppet"? When
d'you start calling me that?

487
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,791
[SAINT-GERMAIN] Apologies.
An outmoded term of endearment.

488
00:23:46,875 --> 00:23:48,000
[SIO] Where'd you pick it up?

489
00:23:48,083 --> 00:23:50,041
[SAINT-GERMAIN]
Next time, Gun Ten: "DOGOO."

490
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:51,916
[SIO] Hey!
Don't change the subject!
