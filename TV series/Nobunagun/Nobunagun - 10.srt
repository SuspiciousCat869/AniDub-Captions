1
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,166
[IYO (13 years old)]
My homeland is destroyed!

2
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:34,833
Everyone I know is dead!

3
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,916
I failed.

4
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,125
I couldn't be strong
like Queen Himiko.

5
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:48,291
[DOGOO]
You're alone.

6
00:00:48,375 --> 00:00:51,458
I know that feeling
all too well.

7
00:00:56,625 --> 00:01:02,333
That night, 1,800 years ago,
is when you and I first met.

8
00:02:35,041 --> 00:02:37,125
Gun Ten: "DOGOO."

9
00:02:54,958 --> 00:02:57,250
[DOGOO] Welcome back,
my young friend.

10
00:02:57,333 --> 00:03:00,000
Our next target is
the Frankish Empire.

11
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:02,083
Its lords,
the Merovingians,

12
00:03:02,166 --> 00:03:04,458
may be of use
to us in our fight.

13
00:03:04,541 --> 00:03:06,083
[IYO (13 years old)]
"The Frankish Empire?"

14
00:03:06,166 --> 00:03:08,791
They rose to prominence
while you were sleeping.

15
00:03:08,875 --> 00:03:11,125
How long did
I sleep, anyhow?

16
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,416
Approximately
300 years.

17
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:17,500
Oh, I see.

18
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,958
Everyone and
everything I ever knew

19
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:24,750
are nothing
but dust now.

20
00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,208
[IYO (16 years old)]
Who is this man?

21
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:42,458
[DOGOO] I
thought you might

22
00:03:42,541 --> 00:03:43,666
pine for
companionship,

23
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,666
and this one seemed
suitably interesting,

24
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:48,791
so I brought
him with me.

25
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:56,416
A pleasure to meet you.

26
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,916
I am Saint-Germain.

27
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,416
What do you
think you're doing?

28
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:02,666
I greet you in
the European way.

29
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,916
I meant you
no offense by it.

30
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,291
[DOGOO] At last.

31
00:04:10,375 --> 00:04:13,583
I've finished converting
the DNA samples into E-genes.

32
00:04:13,666 --> 00:04:17,541
Now we must slip them
into various human bloodlines.

33
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,083
Leave that to us.

34
00:04:19,166 --> 00:04:21,583
We shall find
appropriate candidates.

35
00:04:21,666 --> 00:04:23,458
The souls of our
chosen heroes

36
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,083
will pass down from one
generation to the next,

37
00:04:26,166 --> 00:04:28,041
with none of them the wiser.

38
00:04:28,125 --> 00:04:31,250
When the fateful hour
tolls, they will awaken.

39
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,708
We have to seed as many warriors
within your species as we can.

40
00:04:35,791 --> 00:04:40,041
The enemy is already on its way
to Earth, and the hour is late.

41
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:47,291
Mankind hinges on this mission.

42
00:04:47,375 --> 00:04:49,416
I can hardly wait.

43
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,041
[COMMANDER] I remember
thinking to myself

44
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:52,708
that when next I awoke,

45
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,166
this strange man
would be long gone.

46
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:57,041
I'd return to being alone.

47
00:04:57,125 --> 00:05:00,375
A forgotten relic of a lost age.

48
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,958
[SAINT-GERMAIN]
Welcome back, Miss.

49
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,000
[IYO (18 years old)]
Don't look!

50
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:16,666
How long did I
sleep this time?

51
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,416
200 years, I daresay.

52
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:21,250
How are you here?

53
00:05:21,333 --> 00:05:23,208
My constitution is strong.

54
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:25,375
Rest assured.

55
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,916
Do you see
what I mean?

56
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,958
I told you he
was interesting.

57
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,208
So, then, shall we
go find new additions

58
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:37,375
to our genetic
menagerie?

59
00:05:42,625 --> 00:05:44,000
You can't swing
the proverbial cat

60
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:46,166
in that fortress
without hitting a hero.

61
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,125
So why this man?

62
00:05:48,208 --> 00:05:50,833
All he has to
commend him is speed.

63
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:52,000
Yes, I know.

64
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,416
But maybe
it'll come in handy!

65
00:05:59,833 --> 00:06:02,208
Sleeping Beauty
awakens.

66
00:06:07,625 --> 00:06:09,000
[IYO (20 years old)]
Where to, now?

67
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:10,958
The country of
your birth, Miss.

68
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:11,625
Oh!

69
00:06:11,708 --> 00:06:12,583
Splendid!

70
00:06:12,666 --> 00:06:14,750
I wonder who
we'll be taking!

71
00:06:18,375 --> 00:06:21,208
Of all people,
you're choosing him?

72
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:23,666
[DOGOO] He's the sovereign
of your land, Iyo.

73
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,416
He and Queen Himiko
have much in common.

74
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:27,833
They don't!

75
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:29,166
Look at him!

76
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,500
This man is a butcher!

77
00:06:31,583 --> 00:06:34,083
I'm not preserving his soul
for its gentle nature.

78
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:36,500
You want to entrust
my planet's future

79
00:06:36,583 --> 00:06:39,708
to a man who finds
no value in human life?

80
00:06:39,791 --> 00:06:42,041
Desperate times call
for desperate measures.

81
00:06:42,125 --> 00:06:45,333
I thought you would have
learned that in 1,200 years.

82
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:47,791
Dammit, it's
only been 7 for me!

83
00:06:49,541 --> 00:06:51,333
[SAINT-GERMAIN]
Wait!

84
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:06,416
[Iyo] I'm not your
problem anymore, you know.

85
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,875
[SAINT-GERMAIN] I couldn't
let you go alone.

86
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:12,833
What sort of fair-weather
companion would that make me?

87
00:07:13,291 --> 00:07:15,166
[COMMANDER] For the
first time in centuries,

88
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:18,041
I began to live life
as any other human.

89
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:20,750
A little house,
in a little village.

90
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:22,750
The pleasures of the harvest.

91
00:07:22,833 --> 00:07:24,625
The changing of the seasons,

92
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:27,541
which I hadn't
witnessed in so long.

93
00:07:27,625 --> 00:07:29,791
And then...

94
00:07:33,833 --> 00:07:34,875
[IYO (60 years old)]
Look at you,

95
00:07:34,958 --> 00:07:37,458
lodging with a wrinkled
old thing like me.

96
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:39,125
People will talk,
you know!

97
00:07:39,208 --> 00:07:40,291
Let them.

98
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:41,541
From where I stand,

99
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:44,333
you've aged nary
a fortnight, Miss.

100
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,166
[IYO]
It's gone.

101
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:18,000
All these years later,
I've lost my home again!

102
00:08:18,625 --> 00:08:21,416
We could start
anew elsewhere.

103
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:23,458
No.

104
00:08:23,541 --> 00:08:26,041
I should have figured
it out centuries ago,

105
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,666
but I've finally
learned my lesson.

106
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,083
There are things in life
that must be protected

107
00:08:31,166 --> 00:08:35,375
by any means necessary--
any people necessary!

108
00:08:35,458 --> 00:08:38,916
Even Nobunaga.

109
00:08:39,500 --> 00:08:41,958
[DOGOO] So, you've had
a change of heart?

110
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:43,250
[IYO]
I swear to you.

111
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,500
I'll dedicate whatever
time I may have left

112
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:49,333
to the defense of Earth,
and all life on it.

113
00:08:53,916 --> 00:08:56,875
Good morning to you,
Commander.

114
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,541
Commander?

115
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,625
Our enemy.

116
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:04,666
Are they here yet?

117
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:05,666
[DOGOO]
Almost.

118
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:07,125
Their landfall is imminent.

119
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:08,791
Which is why you
must take the reins

120
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:11,083
of the organization
we discussed.

121
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:12,875
The E-genes have
been disseminated

122
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:14,375
into the general public.

123
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:15,875
Please, rethink this!

124
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,583
I'm not qualified!

125
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:21,750
The millennia have started
to weigh heavily on me.

126
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:26,291
I am not immune to
the passage of time.

127
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:28,541
I see.

128
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:35,041
I'm sorry we only
have my old hand-me-down.

129
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,291
[DOGOO]
Thank you, Iyo.

130
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:41,500
This task belongs
to your kind now.

131
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:44,125
I leave the rest to you.

132
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:08,125
It was only yesterday,
or so it feels.

133
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,333
This moment was
a long time coming.

134
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,916
Yes.

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,791
However...

136
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,708
Gandhi to Johnny Rico.

137
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:22,208
The Battleship Type has pulled
back into the tunnel again.

138
00:10:22,291 --> 00:10:24,000
Johnny Rico to Ellen Ripley.

139
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,833
Prepare for
underwater surveillance.

140
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:27,916
If it sticks to pattern,

141
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,208
it'll reach your
side in about an hour.

142
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:31,375
Copy, Johnny Rico.

143
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,500
I'm going below.

144
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:36,791
Welcome back, Gandhi.

145
00:10:36,875 --> 00:10:38,250
I don't understand it.

146
00:10:38,333 --> 00:10:41,041
All it does is peek out
of the tunnel on this side

147
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,458
and then hurry
back over to the other.

148
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,125
Not that
I'm complaining, mind you.

149
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:49,833
We can't even scratch that thing
without loads more manpower.

150
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:54,791
We are well aware
of the manpower shortage.

151
00:10:54,875 --> 00:10:57,666
But even with our
being at a disadvantage,

152
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,125
this will be a decisive
moment in our war against them.

153
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,833
Rest easy, my Queen.

154
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:11,000
I swear to you, our homeland
will be kept safe this time.

155
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:13,875
Thank you.

156
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:37,750
Oh, what do I do now?

157
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:40,125
We're alone together!

158
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:42,916
You birds done
chewin' the fat?

159
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:44,083
Huh?

160
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:46,333
There's somethin'
we need to talk about.

161
00:11:46,416 --> 00:11:52,166
There's something we
need to talk about?!

162
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,250
Oh God!
We made eye contact!

163
00:11:54,333 --> 00:11:57,625
Huh?

164
00:11:57,708 --> 00:11:58,625
Whoops!

165
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,500
I gotta know--

166
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,083
What?

167
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,541
What do you want?

168
00:12:07,625 --> 00:12:09,166
How come you
were in the middle?

169
00:12:09,250 --> 00:12:10,916
Huh?

170
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,166
When that giant
squid wannabe

171
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,500
took a potshot at
the Clayton Forrester,

172
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:16,375
you were right
in front of it.

173
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,458
No reason to be there unless
you knew the ship was in danger.

174
00:12:20,541 --> 00:12:22,833
Weren't time to
double back after he surfaced,

175
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:26,166
you must'a been there
ahead of schedule.

176
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:28,125
So what was the tip-off?

177
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,125
I'm not sure.

178
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:35,500
I mean, it just kinda seemed
like the right thing to do.

179
00:12:35,583 --> 00:12:38,291
Like a nudge from
the ol' samurai in yer head?

180
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,791
Huh?

181
00:12:39,875 --> 00:12:43,958
Well, I don't really
get how all this stuff works.

182
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:46,041
Yeah, I guess so!

183
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:48,000
So then why'd
you keep mum about it?

184
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,333
Huh?

185
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,375
Wanted ta kill
him yourself

186
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:51,750
and be
the big hero?

187
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:54,916
Not in the least!

188
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,666
Ah, don't get your
knickers in a twist.

189
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:58,041
I been watching ya,

190
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,916
and you're not
that kind of girl.

191
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,541
Clearly.

192
00:13:02,625 --> 00:13:03,250
What?

193
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:04,208
He's been watching me?

194
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,541
Like, watching watching me?

195
00:13:06,625 --> 00:13:08,500
I kept it to myself
'cause I'm such a noob

196
00:13:08,583 --> 00:13:10,083
and you guys know
what you're doing

197
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,750
and I didn't want to be wrong,
not with so much on the line.

198
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,083
It was just a hunch.

199
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:16,833
Well I got
a hunch

200
00:13:16,916 --> 00:13:18,125
we're about to
face death again.

201
00:13:18,208 --> 00:13:18,958
What?

202
00:13:19,041 --> 00:13:20,000
I just heard.

203
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:22,041
The brass decided
to take that tunnel.

204
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:24,125
And all they're
gonna use

205
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:27,416
are First and Second
Platoons to do it.

206
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,416
Wait, all by ourselves?

207
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:30,833
Vidocq and the Commander
are putting together

208
00:13:30,916 --> 00:13:32,541
a plan as we speak.

209
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,083
Whatever it is,

210
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,916
I got a bad
feeling about it.

211
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,416
My gut says
it's too dangerous.

212
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:41,458
Listen up.

213
00:13:41,541 --> 00:13:43,000
My E-gene says
we need you,

214
00:13:43,083 --> 00:13:45,208
so maybe we do.

215
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:45,625
Need me?

216
00:13:45,708 --> 00:13:46,625
Yeah.

217
00:13:46,708 --> 00:13:50,000
'Cause your hunches
are spot-on.

218
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,166
I dunno.

219
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,375
This from the bloke

220
00:13:52,458 --> 00:13:55,375
who outwitted every
bobby in London-town.

221
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,250
He's got a real
feel for this stuff.

222
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,625
Think I'd just
take the compliment.

223
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:05,708
Better not to offend him.

224
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:27,125
"Fifty years in
the world of the living--"

225
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,666
Asai has betrayed us!
How dare he?

226
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,250
Lord Nobunaga!

227
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,916
We'll be pinned between
Asakura and Asai if we stay!

228
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,125
[HIDEYOSHI]
Lord Nobunaga!

229
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,958
Go now; I shall take
to the rear with my men!

230
00:14:44,041 --> 00:14:45,666
Withdraw while I hold them off!

231
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:47,583
Hideyoshi!

232
00:14:47,666 --> 00:14:49,333
And at the center of
that nest, the true guardian

233
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:54,541
of EI evolutionary history:
The Battleship Type.

234
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,291
Here's the latest
interior scan of the tunnel.

235
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,333
We need better intel on
the strength of those tentacles!

236
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,791
We're flying blind!

237
00:15:06,875 --> 00:15:08,166
That's all the data we have!

238
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:11,333
What if we approach
from this angle?

239
00:15:11,416 --> 00:15:13,208
Hey, guys--listen up!

240
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,416
I didn't even know
you were back.

241
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:21,125
Go ahead, girl--
speak your piece.

242
00:15:21,208 --> 00:15:22,375
Uh, well.

243
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,791
I guess I sort of
have an opinion

244
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:30,041
about the plan
to take the tunnel?

245
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:31,333
Ugh.

246
00:15:31,416 --> 00:15:33,708
Could you piece
your thoughts together

247
00:15:33,791 --> 00:15:35,916
before you open your mouth?

248
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,083
When you don't,
we waste valuable time

249
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,416
while you gather
your wits about you.

250
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,458
This operation
to conquer the tunnel

251
00:15:43,541 --> 00:15:45,875
is our most
important mission thus far.

252
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,333
Simply put,
our success or lack thereof,

253
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:51,083
will set the tone for
the remainder of this war.

254
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,333
This is a place
for educated opinions!

255
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:57,250
You do not traipse in here
and start spitballing tactics!

256
00:15:57,333 --> 00:16:00,291
We're trying to save as
many lives as we can here!

257
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:08,625
Don't you talk to me
like I'm a damn fool!

258
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,708
You have the floor.

259
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:20,458
The EIs with the base cells
are hiding in the tunnel,

260
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:23,458
so we're gonna get to 'em
by defeating the big one

261
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:27,208
who's goaltending
those entrances, right?

262
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:30,625
It's currently going back and
forth between the two entrances,

263
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:33,541
which is actually pretty
weird if you think about it.

264
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,875
If it wants to intercept us,
why not wait in the middle?

265
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,083
Yeah.

266
00:16:38,166 --> 00:16:40,125
It's like he's purposely
trying to piss us off.

267
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:42,625
--That's what I'm saying!
--Huh?

268
00:16:42,708 --> 00:16:44,500
All we're paying attention
to are those entrances.

269
00:16:44,583 --> 00:16:46,416
What's going on elsewhere?

270
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:50,208
What if the bulk of
the Evolutionary Invaders

271
00:16:50,291 --> 00:16:52,208
are busy digging
an escape tunnel

272
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:53,750
that empties out
to who-knows-where?

273
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:54,583
An'--

274
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:59,208
allowing them all to escape?

275
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:01,083
That's my theory, at least.

276
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,208
[COMMANDER]
Well, Vidocq?

277
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,916
Yes, Commander!

278
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,250
I'd say that hypothesis
is not without its merits.

279
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:15,250
Truth be told, she's
probably right on the money.

280
00:17:15,333 --> 00:17:16,166
Damn her eyes!

281
00:17:16,250 --> 00:17:17,750
Why didn't I think of that?

282
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:21,125
Can you deduce a possible exit
point for this "escape tunnel?"

283
00:17:21,208 --> 00:17:23,375
Of course.

284
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,125
Their previous
failures would tell them

285
00:17:26,208 --> 00:17:29,000
that the nearby coastlines
and the Panama Canal

286
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,666
are heavily guarded.

287
00:17:38,250 --> 00:17:40,000
Lake Nicaragua is their
most likely destination,

288
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:42,000
given the variables.

289
00:17:42,083 --> 00:17:43,833
Once they've dispersed
into a lake of that size,

290
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:45,750
finding them will be difficult.

291
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:49,541
We need to intercept them before
they reach their destination.

292
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:51,708
That's why beating
the Battleship Type

293
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,375
is our top priority.

294
00:17:53,458 --> 00:17:55,416
Don't you see
that's a waste of time?

295
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:00,041
All I'm saying is instead
of attacking 'em from behind

296
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:03,166
and it being super tough,
let's hit the enemy

297
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,791
where they least expect it
and engage 'em head-on.

298
00:18:05,875 --> 00:18:07,250
You little--!

299
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:10,833
I take it you have a plan?

300
00:18:10,916 --> 00:18:12,291
Yeah!

301
00:18:15,208 --> 00:18:17,000
Cutting them off at
the pass is gonna be too tough

302
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:19,291
while they're underground,
so forget that.

303
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,750
Instead...

304
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,708
We'll make them change course.

305
00:18:25,791 --> 00:18:29,000
Y'know, draw 'em above-ground!

306
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:32,000
When they show up,
we'll already be there,

307
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:34,208
ready to put
the hurt down on 'em!

308
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:35,500
This is lunacy!

309
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:38,291
She speaks as though we
can dictate their actions!

310
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:41,000
'Cause we can!

311
00:18:41,083 --> 00:18:45,583
It's gonna work, but it'll take
all we've got to pull it off.

312
00:18:47,291 --> 00:18:49,250
[CAPA] You pull me
from active duty, and now this?

313
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,166
Guess the girl's
getting her payback.

314
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:54,083
Must be all the grief
I gave her during basic.

315
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,833
Ain't that a bitch!

316
00:18:56,916 --> 00:18:59,041
When this is all over,
I'm stomping the rookie flat.

317
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,916
My role in this
mission is bollocks!

318
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:02,875
Hold on!

319
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,291
This isn't gonna work!

320
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:06,083
Incorrect.

321
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:09,083
I've factored all variables
in Sio's plan of attack.

322
00:19:09,166 --> 00:19:11,875
Their powers combined
should be enough.

323
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,333
So where do they go,

324
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:16,083
once Newton and Capa
do their thing?

325
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:18,791
Filtering the enemy's
route and speed

326
00:19:18,875 --> 00:19:21,125
through the
topographical specifics,

327
00:19:21,208 --> 00:19:23,583
then applying
Newton's and Capa's

328
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:27,458
strength against that data--

329
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,333
I have it.

330
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,291
This will be our battleground.

331
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,208
Evacuation of
civilians complete.

332
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,458
You are clear to engage.

333
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:41,708
Yeh, roger that.

334
00:19:41,791 --> 00:19:43,708
[GERONIMO] It's a clever
plan she's thought up.

335
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:45,583
But will it actually work?

336
00:19:45,666 --> 00:19:47,583
With you helping,
I'm sure it'll be perfect!

337
00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:49,208
Give it your all, Gaudí.

338
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:51,958
You play an
important part, don'tcha!

339
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:56,333
Right.

340
00:19:56,416 --> 00:19:59,625
[HUNTER] I can't believe
they're sending me into combat.

341
00:19:59,708 --> 00:20:01,583
Dammit, Jack, I'm a doctor!

342
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,666
Better you try my job
than I try yours.

343
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,833
A blade's a blade,
and we're short on bodies.

344
00:20:07,916 --> 00:20:09,833
The best of British out there,

345
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:13,208
and remember--I'll be
too busy to save you.

346
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,666
Feels like rush hour
on the 405, man.

347
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:22,500
Heh, ya think we'll
see any action tonight?

348
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:25,375
I don't think anything's
gonna pop out of the water

349
00:20:25,458 --> 00:20:28,166
with a target on it,
if that's what you mean.

350
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,291
It's my first time, Cyx.
Be gentle.

351
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,125
Bite me, Mahesh.

352
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:41,041
No one rides on the back
of my bike except the Princess!

353
00:20:41,125 --> 00:20:44,458
I hear we have your platoon's
rookie to thank for all this?

354
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:45,708
Yes.

355
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,833
She's getting us through
quite the sticky wicket.

356
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,666
Actually...

357
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,375
She's been doing that
for us all this time.

358
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:55,000
Ever since we
first met in Taiwan.

359
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,000
[CYX] Whatever.

360
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:59,500
Can I run her over
when this is all done?

361
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:01,000
Doesn't that seem
a little much?

362
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:03,250
The Battleship
Type's the problem!

363
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:05,458
If it backs up the little ones,
we're done for!

364
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,875
Can't we keep him
busy with a decoy?

365
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,541
We could dangle some Holders
at the tunnel entrances!

366
00:21:10,625 --> 00:21:12,083
Absolutely not!

367
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:16,416
We're already spreading our
Holders way too thin out there!

368
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,250
One is enough!

369
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:24,541
You only need one E-gene
holder to take down that squid.

370
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:26,208
Yours truly!

371
00:22:02,458 --> 00:22:04,500
Here we go!

372
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,333
Oi.

373
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,958
How come you named this
operation "Stone Forest"?

374
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:41,666
Huh?

375
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:42,333
No reason!

376
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,083
Totally random!

377
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:43,958
Yup!

378
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:45,208
It's "Ishinomori" in Japanese--

379
00:23:45,291 --> 00:23:46,625
ain't he a manga writer?

380
00:23:46,708 --> 00:23:48,875
Next time, Gun Eleven:

381
00:23:48,958 --> 00:23:50,875
"Operation Stone Forest,
Part 1"!

382
00:23:50,958 --> 00:23:52,750
You are such a nerd.
