1
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,583
Look sharp, man!

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:42,916
Make yourself useful!

3
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,791
Protect the girl while
I keep the enemy occupied!

4
00:00:45,875 --> 00:00:48,166
Case it's escaped
your notice, I'm injured!

5
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,708
Spare me!

6
00:00:49,791 --> 00:00:52,291
Whining is for ordinary humans.

7
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,875
Bloody hell.

8
00:00:54,958 --> 00:00:57,875
An' how d'you plan on
"keeping 'em occupied?"

9
00:00:57,958 --> 00:00:59,458
Watch and learn.

10
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,375
I'm sorry?

11
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:12,125
Heed my words, beasties!

12
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:13,708
I am Nobunagun!

13
00:01:13,791 --> 00:01:17,083
The playing
field is now level!

14
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:18,625
Ready yourselves!

15
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:53,791
Gun Two:
"Evolutionary Invaders."

16
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:14,250
How'm I missing 'em?

17
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,125
Plonker!

18
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:16,833
Ix-nay on the full-auto!

19
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:20,333
The recoil makes
your balance rubbish!

20
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,541
But, I--

21
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,541
The idea is to take
'em out, not salute 'em!

22
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:24,666
Great.

23
00:03:24,750 --> 00:03:27,041
Stuck with an amateur.

24
00:03:27,125 --> 00:03:30,875
Asao! Ogura!

25
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,125
This isn't a drill!

26
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:35,291
Take cover, immediately!

27
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:39,291
What is he--?

28
00:03:39,375 --> 00:03:40,000
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

29
00:03:40,083 --> 00:03:42,083
I can't aim this thing!

30
00:03:42,166 --> 00:03:51,541
Way to take your time.

31
00:03:51,625 --> 00:03:54,375
Have 5 Gs.

32
00:03:56,666 --> 00:03:57,958
Stop ogling!

33
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,500
Get the job done.

34
00:03:59,583 --> 00:04:04,000
Or do you have as much trouble
hitting stationary targets?

35
00:04:04,083 --> 00:04:05,541
Clip me and you're worm food.

36
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,583
I guarantee.

37
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:09,708
Oi, Newton.

38
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,250
Don't start with me.

39
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,791
Next time, perhaps try
waiting on the rest of us, Jack.

40
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:16,833
I'd say something
about jumping the gun,

41
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:20,083
but in this case it would
be a little too on the nose.

42
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:20,666
Where's Gandhi?

43
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:23,208
On your 6.

44
00:04:24,208 --> 00:04:27,666
Would you please be
so kind as to shoot these two?

45
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,666
Newton and I are defense.

46
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,166
You and Jacky Boy are offense.

47
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,208
And since he's out-- well,
if it's not too much trouble.

48
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:36,458
It appears Gandhi and Newton

49
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:38,583
are switching to backup
for this "Nobunagun."

50
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:40,375
Do we have cause to be worried?

51
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:44,166
This girl is, after all,
far from adequately trained.

52
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,541
The force of Oda's personality
will surely give her an edge.

53
00:04:47,625 --> 00:04:49,750
He was a most indomitable soul.

54
00:04:49,833 --> 00:04:52,833
In the fog of war,
no man's instinct for conquest

55
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:54,958
held a candle to his own.

56
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,625
And yet.

57
00:04:57,708 --> 00:05:00,250
Something about her.

58
00:05:07,208 --> 00:05:10,458
So, we've got force fields
and gravity manipulation now.

59
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:11,708
Alright.

60
00:05:11,791 --> 00:05:13,083
We might actually have a chance.

61
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,666
D'you think?

62
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,625
I'm going to need you to scale
back on the arrogance a smidge.

63
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:20,458
And to be clear, it's not
wholesale gravity manipulation.

64
00:05:20,541 --> 00:05:23,458
I pin down only what I step on.

65
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:26,291
There's no way I can stomp all
of our little friends at once.

66
00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,291
I hope you're factoring that in.

67
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,375
Matter of fact, I am.

68
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:33,708
I only need you
to anchor one thing.

69
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,416
Gandhi, you're on guard detail.

70
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:37,250
Get Asao and Jack to the tower.

71
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,875
Protect them!

72
00:05:38,958 --> 00:05:40,833
Sorry, miss.

73
00:05:40,916 --> 00:05:42,458
Not to disagree, but my job
is protecting combatants--

74
00:05:42,541 --> 00:05:44,250
Don't argue with me!

75
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:48,625
God help all of you if
anything happens to Asao.

76
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:52,458
I will not be held
responsible for my actions.

77
00:05:53,958 --> 00:05:56,416
Guard detail, it is.

78
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:57,958
Evacuation status?

79
00:05:58,041 --> 00:05:59,583
Ninety percent clear.

80
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:00,958
Under our advisement,

81
00:06:01,041 --> 00:06:02,916
Taiwan has directed
its forces to search and rescue.

82
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,250
They ought to have been
so wise 15 minutes ago.

83
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:08,500
Politics, ma'am.

84
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,333
Even in an age as
information-rich as this,

85
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,541
word of our enemy's
prowess travels slowly.

86
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:15,208
No more secrets.

87
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:18,458
Arrange a press conference
once this battle ends.

88
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:23,000
If we're to make
appreciable inroads,

89
00:06:23,083 --> 00:06:24,958
the world must hear
the truth from its defenders.

90
00:06:39,375 --> 00:06:40,333
Here they come.

91
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:41,875
Work your magic.

92
00:06:41,958 --> 00:06:45,916
For the record, I think you're
a round shy of a full clip.

93
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:51,416
There we go.

94
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,416
That's the spot.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,250
Dodge this,
you sons of bitches!

96
00:07:01,708 --> 00:07:02,541
Damn it!

97
00:07:02,625 --> 00:07:04,458
There're too many of them!

98
00:07:05,583 --> 00:07:07,291
3 o'clock high!

99
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,583
Bastards cut around us!

100
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,125
Takeda's cavalry is fierce!

101
00:07:14,208 --> 00:07:15,583
Call your strength!

102
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,625
For the cavalry
vanguard has a weakness.

103
00:07:18,708 --> 00:07:20,083
The single-line formation

104
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,291
leaves them open
to attack upon reloading.

105
00:07:23,375 --> 00:07:25,458
The solution is elementary.

106
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:28,125
We resort to overkill!

107
00:07:28,208 --> 00:07:33,416
If a single line
proves inadequate...

108
00:07:33,875 --> 00:07:35,208
...make it two!

109
00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,625
More from above!

110
00:07:42,208 --> 00:07:44,666
If two are unequal to the task.

111
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:50,458
Make it 3!

112
00:07:55,458 --> 00:07:56,958
Behold, wretches!

113
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,208
My vaunted Triple Volley!

114
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,166
I presumed that
tactic apocryphal.

115
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:05,708
Tales of the infamous
Triple Volley were real?

116
00:08:06,166 --> 00:08:07,916
The current state
of cultural wisdom

117
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,125
sheds precious little
light on Nobunaga's tactics.

118
00:08:11,208 --> 00:08:13,041
The man was a genius.

119
00:08:13,416 --> 00:08:14,583
Incoming!

120
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,125
Let 'em get point-blank, then!

121
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:21,041
I can't miss!

122
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,000
Gotta hand it to her.

123
00:08:33,083 --> 00:08:35,291
Girl's got pluck.

124
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,500
How many more?

125
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,125
Well, uh...

126
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,333
I think we're done.

127
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:57,583
Oh.

128
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,458
Sounds good.

129
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,666
Hey!

130
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,083
And she's down.

131
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,750
It was only a matter of time.

132
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:08,875
An AU weapon extracts
a heavy toll from the untrained.

133
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,333
An impressive
body count, though.

134
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:14,041
I have to give her that.

135
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,708
Tell me Asao's okay.

136
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,166
She will be fine.

137
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:19,708
That said, I recommended
a trip to the nearest hospital.

138
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:20,875
Here we go with the act.

139
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,666
You're a warrior,
not a good Samaritan.

140
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,541
You could use
some triage yourself.

141
00:09:28,375 --> 00:09:29,625
Whatever.

142
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:31,958
Just let it be known
the colossus was my kill.

143
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:33,375
Enemy unresponsive.

144
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:35,208
No movement detected.

145
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,750
How many Invader casualties

146
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,000
resulted from
the new girl's actions?

147
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:40,208
202.

148
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:41,416
Interesting.

149
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:44,041
What is it now?

150
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,291
Picking up major
thermal energy, ma'am!

151
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,791
Emanating from the one
Jack the Ripper killed!

152
00:09:48,875 --> 00:09:51,916
Something bothering you, Newton?

153
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,875
The big one's mass
is spiking like mad!

154
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,458
There's enough energy

155
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,541
being generated inside
to power a small town!

156
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:03,250
It's like a balloon
about to burst!

157
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,083
He's going to pierce it!

158
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:10,083
This is bad!

159
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:12,166
It's going to blow!

160
00:10:39,958 --> 00:10:44,416
The milk of human kindness flows
to this island in great waves.

161
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:47,833
All the world bends
its thought to the victims' aid.

162
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:50,916
Every person here
has either saved someone else,

163
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:55,416
or been devastated
by their powerlessness to do so.

164
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:58,208
Mankind now not only appreciates

165
00:10:58,291 --> 00:11:03,916
what a terrible threat it faces
in the Evolutionary Invaders,

166
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:06,875
but has come to understand,
perhaps begrudgingly,

167
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:11,333
that the E-Gene holders are
its last best hope against them.

168
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:16,750
430 years
it's been, Oda Nobunaga.

169
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:21,750
Given this planet's resources,
I knew the time would come

170
00:11:21,833 --> 00:11:25,333
when the Invaders
would stake their claim.

171
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:28,500
I had no choice but to harvest
the DNA of key specimens

172
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:32,083
like you and refine
it for future use.

173
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:35,166
I need your help,
as does the world.

174
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:36,916
You wield an AU Weapon,

175
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,208
from the only arsenal able
to match the enemy's might.

176
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,250
I will not compel you.

177
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:46,791
This is a matter involving
not only Oda Nobunaga,

178
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:50,541
but a young woman
named Shio Ogura.

179
00:11:51,166 --> 00:11:53,166
One must weigh
the consequences for her.

180
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:54,166
The decision is
far from an easy one.

181
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,458
She may well have
to turn her back

182
00:11:57,541 --> 00:12:01,625
on the life she's built
for herself thus far.

183
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,875
The answer can wait
for her to return home.

184
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:18,791
A child cannot be
expected to choose wisely.

185
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:22,708
Not under such duress.

186
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:24,291
Your tactics haven't changed.

187
00:12:24,375 --> 00:12:27,500
You plucked the same
heartstrings in me

188
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,041
once upon a time.

189
00:12:29,125 --> 00:12:30,750
It cannot be helped.

190
00:12:30,833 --> 00:12:34,708
The power that girl
now wields is vital to us.

191
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,750
To be burdened
with so much, so quickly.

192
00:12:37,833 --> 00:12:39,750
What must it be like for her,

193
00:12:39,833 --> 00:12:43,166
discovering she harbors the
soul of a 16th-century warlord

194
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,125
on whose ruthlessness
the world depends?

195
00:12:46,208 --> 00:12:46,625
Unfortunate, to be sure.

196
00:12:46,708 --> 00:12:48,750
Nonetheless.

197
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,708
Whatever the cost to her,
we must bear in mind:

198
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:56,375
without her cooperation,
mankind will fall.

199
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,625
Perhaps.

200
00:12:59,708 --> 00:13:03,291
But forcing an E-Gene
lock can be damaging.

201
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:11,416
We are DOGOO.

202
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,000
A supernational organization

203
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,000
formed secretly
in anticipation of this day.

204
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:17,541
A few short hours ago,

205
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,041
mankind watched
as Taiwan was laid siege to

206
00:13:20,125 --> 00:13:23,583
by creatures against which
conventional weapons do nothing.

207
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,333
Creatures we dub
"Evolutionary Invaders."

208
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:28,833
Only a certain type
of warrior can counter them.

209
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:31,333
A select group of humans

210
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,916
who possess what
are known as "E-Genes."

211
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,541
Genetic markers that put them
physically on par with our foes.

212
00:13:34,625 --> 00:13:38,791
The situation is grave,
but not yet hopeless.

213
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:39,791
As of now.

214
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,250
We officially make

215
00:13:41,333 --> 00:13:43,166
our intentions known
to the whole world.

216
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:46,875
We shall combat the Evolutionary
Invaders by any means necessary.

217
00:13:46,958 --> 00:13:48,708
DOGOO humbly implores you

218
00:13:48,791 --> 00:13:51,166
to help us flush out
this cosmic menace.

219
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:03,041
The people of Japan pledge
their unwavering support.

220
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:12,125
Why now?

221
00:14:26,916 --> 00:14:28,083
The country is still in shock

222
00:14:28,166 --> 00:14:30,208
after last week's
emergency press conference

223
00:14:30,291 --> 00:14:31,875
addressing
the incident in Taiwan

224
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,375
confirmed the existence

225
00:14:33,458 --> 00:14:35,333
of hostile forces
from another world.

226
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,416
Jeez!

227
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,541
The news can't
seem to give it a rest.

228
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:41,000
Wouldn't be so bad if they
didn't cut into all my shows.

229
00:14:41,083 --> 00:14:42,958
Guess I can't
really blame people

230
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,666
for being obsessed, though.

231
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:47,083
Um...

232
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:50,666
So, are you
gonna be okay, or--?

233
00:14:50,750 --> 00:14:55,625
They still wanna run a few
tests on me Monday morning.

234
00:14:55,708 --> 00:14:57,416
But the doc says I should
be out of here by next week.

235
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,416
That's a relief.

236
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,791
Thank you, Sio.

237
00:15:00,875 --> 00:15:08,333
Huh?

238
00:15:08,416 --> 00:15:10,041
Hey so, um, Asao?

239
00:15:10,125 --> 00:15:11,375
Yeah?

240
00:15:11,458 --> 00:15:12,583
Why exactly did you invite

241
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,875
someone like
me along with you guys?

242
00:15:14,958 --> 00:15:15,875
What are you talkin' about?

243
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:17,208
Y'know, the statue.

244
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,541
No, I know that.

245
00:15:18,625 --> 00:15:21,166
See, the thing is,
not to sound weird or anything,

246
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:23,625
but I'd actually been wantin' to
hang out with you for a while.

247
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,166
You're kiddin', right?

248
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,583
'Member the time with
the textbook freshman year?

249
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,958
You were acting
all into it and stuff,

250
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,250
but really you were foaming at
the mouth over that tank manual.

251
00:15:33,333 --> 00:15:34,833
That wasn't what it looked like!

252
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:36,416
My mom's like a crazy military
buff or whatever you call it.

253
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,791
Seriously,
every time the TV's on

254
00:15:38,875 --> 00:15:41,458
it's either Godzilla
or a war movie!

255
00:15:41,541 --> 00:15:44,708
Yeah, I know.

256
00:15:44,791 --> 00:15:46,208
It's creepy.

257
00:15:46,291 --> 00:15:47,958
Not at all.

258
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:50,000
You never force
yourself to belong.

259
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,291
That's pretty cool in my book.

260
00:15:52,875 --> 00:15:54,166
You're you.

261
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:54,916
If the rest of the world
doesn't get it, their loss.

262
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,291
You think I'm cool?

263
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:01,458
I kinda always have.

264
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:04,125
Can you explain to us

265
00:16:04,208 --> 00:16:06,708
exactly what these
Evolutionary Invaders are?

266
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:08,041
I'll try.

267
00:16:08,125 --> 00:16:10,291
As this is all fresh,
we have only limited data

268
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,333
provided by DOGOO to
build any conjecture on.

269
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,416
But the prevailing theory,
as far as I understand it,

270
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:18,041
is that they piggy-backed
on a small meteorite

271
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,708
which hit the
Pacific 10 years ago.

272
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,291
Beyond that,
we just don't know yet.

273
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:24,208
They adapted to
Earth's environment

274
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:25,750
with startling speed.

275
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:27,291
A truly magnificent feat.

276
00:16:27,375 --> 00:16:29,666
Note this graphic.

277
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:31,916
You can see the carcasses
of several distinct

278
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,833
types of Invader
recovered by DOGOO.

279
00:16:33,916 --> 00:16:35,625
Each displayed chronologically.

280
00:16:35,708 --> 00:16:38,250
Their current stage
of development is oceanic.

281
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,375
We expect both amphibious
and reptilian phases

282
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,125
to follow in rapid succession.

283
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:44,750
It's only a matter of time

284
00:16:44,833 --> 00:16:46,833
before they
venture from the sea.

285
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,333
Their likely objective,

286
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:49,875
at the risk of
sounding alarmist,

287
00:16:49,958 --> 00:16:52,166
is to rise through
the ranks of Earth's ecosystem

288
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:55,208
until they are
the apex predator.

289
00:16:57,041 --> 00:16:58,333
That's insane!

290
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,833
These guys are actually
creatures from outer space?

291
00:17:00,916 --> 00:17:03,541
Like that one movie with
the aliens, what was it called?

292
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:04,625
Oh!

293
00:17:04,708 --> 00:17:06,458
You mean Gamera 2:
Attack of Legion?

294
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,833
Huh?

295
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:11,375
No, actually, I was thinkin'

296
00:17:11,458 --> 00:17:13,958
that big Hollywood one,
with Will Smith?

297
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:17,791
I never saw Gamera Two.

298
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,500
Is it really
worth checking out?

299
00:17:19,583 --> 00:17:20,750
Yeah.

300
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,416
And the effects
are pretty solid.

301
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,916
This footage comes to us

302
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,375
from a tourist in Taiwan
the day of the attack.

303
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,291
And yes, it is
what it looks like:

304
00:17:27,375 --> 00:17:30,250
a massive gun in the hands
of a high school girl.

305
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:33,583
This is an unregistered
E-Gene holder

306
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:35,208
who happened to be on the scene.

307
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:37,041
She is not with DOGOO as of yet.

308
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:39,250
I'd like to stress,
if I may, that enrollment

309
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,875
in our organization
is strictly voluntary.

310
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:45,875
While we'd love to have her,
the decision is hers alone.

311
00:17:46,583 --> 00:17:48,041
We now turn to
Word on the Street

312
00:17:48,125 --> 00:17:49,041
for thoughts on the situation
from viewers just like you.

313
00:17:49,125 --> 00:17:49,708
Want me to turn it off?

314
00:17:49,791 --> 00:17:50,583
No.

315
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:51,750
S'okay.

316
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,291
Gotta stay current.

317
00:17:53,375 --> 00:17:55,000
Look, all I'm saying is it's
practically our own back yard.

318
00:17:55,083 --> 00:17:57,750
First Taiwan, next they'll
want a piece of Japan, right?

319
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,291
Well, I'm glad someone
can fight these things.

320
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,208
I'd just like to know more
'bout how they're picked.

321
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:03,416
Hell.

322
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,166
I could be one of 'em.

323
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,791
Put me in there'n see.

324
00:18:07,333 --> 00:18:08,750
I get that people
are freaked out and all,

325
00:18:08,833 --> 00:18:10,708
but we can't
take this lyin' down.

326
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:12,666
We gotta do whatever it takes.

327
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,333
As far as I'm concerned,

328
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:16,583
we should all take
a page from Uncle Ben:

329
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:17,833
with great power comes
great responsibility.

330
00:18:17,916 --> 00:18:19,375
Meh.

331
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:20,583
It's for the sake of the world;
people need to stop whining.

332
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,291
Yeah!

333
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:23,083
Give 'em the hurt!

334
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:26,875
Wow.

335
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,625
Where do they find these people?

336
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:33,208
You're joining, huh?

337
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,500
Yeah.

338
00:18:35,916 --> 00:18:37,875
Mom and Dad were kind of upset
at first, but they get it.

339
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,750
What aren't you saying?

340
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,666
It's just a lot
to take in, y'know?

341
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:48,375
Who wouldn't be scared?

342
00:18:48,458 --> 00:18:49,416
There are monsters.

343
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,208
Real monsters.

344
00:18:51,291 --> 00:18:54,000
And everyone expects
me to fight them.

345
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:56,375
I feel like
I don't have a choice.

346
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,666
I didn't choose this.

347
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:02,166
Someone just pulled
the rug out from under me.

348
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,916
Suddenly, I'm "special."

349
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,375
Suddenly,
I don't know who I am.

350
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:09,041
I'm scared.

351
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:10,458
I'm just a kid.

352
00:19:10,541 --> 00:19:14,875
An awkward nobody.

353
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:15,666
And like that,
I'm everyone's business.

354
00:19:15,750 --> 00:19:16,833
People are counting on me.

355
00:19:16,916 --> 00:19:19,500
People need me
to fight for them.

356
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,083
Asao.

357
00:19:22,166 --> 00:19:23,333
You thanked me earlier.

358
00:19:23,416 --> 00:19:25,250
What was it for?

359
00:19:25,333 --> 00:19:26,625
Well... you saved me.

360
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:31,208
See, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

361
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:34,375
I didn't, though.

362
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,750
It's like a balloon
about to burst!

363
00:19:36,833 --> 00:19:39,458
Huh?

364
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:45,625
One of 'em's still kickin'.

365
00:19:45,708 --> 00:19:50,541
Come on.

366
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,083
You can do this.

367
00:19:52,166 --> 00:19:54,000
Just focus!

368
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:55,958
He's going to pierce it!

369
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,916
This is bad!

370
00:20:00,083 --> 00:20:04,458
Asao!

371
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:06,833
I collapsed.

372
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,291
I couldn't do anything.

373
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,833
I was useless.

374
00:20:10,916 --> 00:20:12,458
The only reason
you're here right now

375
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,791
is 'cause Gandhi
and them stepped in

376
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,166
and saved you, not me.

377
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,541
You really think you had
nothing to do with it, huh?

378
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,291
Skewed way of lookin'
at things, don't'cha think?

379
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,291
The odds of anyone finding me

380
00:20:26,375 --> 00:20:27,875
at the foot of
that statue were slim.

381
00:20:27,958 --> 00:20:29,333
Just think about it.

382
00:20:29,416 --> 00:20:31,416
Truth is, the only
reason they knew I was there

383
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:34,541
was 'cause you led 'em to me.

384
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:36,333
You were the one who came back.

385
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,916
Look Sio, I get
that you're terrified.

386
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,125
You said it yourself;
who wouldn't be, in your shoes?

387
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,750
But whatever the world thinks

388
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,750
about you and your special
powers, whatever you choose,

389
00:20:46,833 --> 00:20:48,833
never forget you're
the girl who came running

390
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:51,750
to help before you
even knew you had 'em.

391
00:20:51,833 --> 00:20:55,416
Oh, Asao!

392
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:56,791
And just so you know,

393
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,791
I take these life-debt
things super-duper serious.

394
00:20:58,875 --> 00:21:02,000
And I'm not just
thankful you saved my bacon.

395
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:03,458
Wow.

396
00:21:03,541 --> 00:21:05,166
Lil' bit awkward.

397
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,583
I'm thankful you're my friend.

398
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:13,291
There she is!

399
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:16,541
Start rolling!

400
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,000
Will you be joining DOGOO?

401
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,208
Did your abilities
come as a shock to you?

402
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:23,500
Funny, how fast
you stop being scared.

403
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:28,291
Sometimes you just have
to remember when you weren't.

404
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,333
Like with Asao.

405
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:32,166
I didn't think twice.

406
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:36,458
Someone I cared about needed
protecting, and I stepped up.

407
00:21:36,541 --> 00:21:39,083
That's all there was to it.

408
00:21:54,166 --> 00:21:56,791
I think I've got this.

409
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,666
Okay, yes, I was
totally hyped to join DOGOO,

410
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,125
but that was
before I realized their

411
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,916
drill instructor
has it out for me!

412
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,833
Give it your all
or I give you mine.

413
00:23:46,916 --> 00:23:49,166
No!

414
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,541
Next time, Gun Three:
"Capa's Island." See you then!
