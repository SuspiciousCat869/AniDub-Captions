[COMMANDER] I'm confused.

233
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:39,000
You intend to engage the enemy
with a battery of descent pods?

234
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:40,083
[SIO] Ma'am.

235
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:41,875
We have to think
outside the box here.

236
00:15:41,958 --> 00:15:43,833
We know the Battleship
Type carries an army

237
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,000
of Land Mine Types
that detonate on impact.

238
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:48,541
[SIO] We couldn't
take it down 'cause its

239
00:15:48,625 --> 00:15:51,375
arms are basically rigged to
blow up whatever it touches.

240
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,291
If we have any hope
of taking the big guy

241
00:15:53,375 --> 00:15:54,916
out of the equation,
our only choice is to

242
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,625
focus on the tentacles first.

243
00:15:56,708 --> 00:15:58,416
Oui, oui,
that we understand;

244
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,750
but what's next?

245
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:02,583
How will the descent pods
help take him down?

246
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:03,750
[SIO] That's the fun part.

247
00:16:03,833 --> 00:16:05,041
What?

248
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,708
[SIO] The Battleship
Type's first instinct will

249
00:16:06,791 --> 00:16:09,875
be to clear the pods out of
his way so he can advance.

250
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:11,416
As his tentacles make contact,

251
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:15,041
we'll get Three-D data on
their relative positions.

252
00:16:15,125 --> 00:16:16,583
And, once we
hone in on that,

253
00:16:16,666 --> 00:16:19,083
he can be sniped
from a distance.

254
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,500
[VIDOCQ] By you, presumably.

255
00:16:20,583 --> 00:16:23,125
No, sir. By these.

256
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,666
[SIO] I need you to round up
as many as possible.

257
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:29,000
M1-A2 Abrams tanks.

258
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,666
[SIO] I know what
you're thinking:

259
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,708
"Won't a battalion of
A1s be just as good?"

260
00:16:33,791 --> 00:16:35,500
But let me tell you:
these bad boys are

261
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,333
hands down the
best tool for the job.

262
00:16:37,416 --> 00:16:40,416
First off, the A2's equipped
with state of the art IVIS!

263
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,166
Meaning the target's
location data can be

264
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,875
shared by every tank in
the operation in real time!

265
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:47,291
Secondly, the FCS, which
is linked to the POSNAV,

266
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,708
calculates target distance
and angle of sightline.

267
00:16:49,791 --> 00:16:51,541
And thirdly, the main
cannons are built

268
00:16:51,625 --> 00:16:53,625
with vertical and
horizontal stabilizers,

269
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:55,375
which is exactly
what you need to offset

270
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,583
the motion of the ship
they'll be deployed on!

271
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:58,708
[SIO] On top of that, you've got

272
00:16:58,791 --> 00:17:00,541
one-twenty milimeter
smooth-bore guns

273
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:04,083
that fire M-Eight-Twenty-Nine
APF-SDS rounds!

274
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:06,458
[SIO] Gotta love that, right?

275
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:07,875
[SIO] We're talkin'
a sixteen-hundred-fifty

276
00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:09,500
meter-per-second
muzzle velocity!

277
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:11,250
And an LD ratio, or the round's

278
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:13,791
penetration capacity,
of over thirty!

279
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:16,083
[SIO] There's records
of one boring through

280
00:17:16,166 --> 00:17:17,791
seven-hundred-ten milimeters of

281
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,333
steel armor at a range
of 2 kilometers.

282
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,208
For reference,
German Leopards and

283
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:26,000
Japanese Type Ninety's
have LDs of only twenty-two.

284
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:27,375
Young lady, one moment.

285
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:30,291
You have all that information
memorized by heart?

286
00:17:30,375 --> 00:17:31,750
I'm speechless.

287
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,500
If you please, ma'am,
that's not our concern.

288
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:36,375
Impressive, I'll grant you that.

289
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:37,958
But conventional
weaponry would be

290
00:17:38,041 --> 00:17:39,916
comical against
the Battleship Type.

291
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:41,625
[SIO] Yes, exactly!

292
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:43,750
An AU weapon would cut

293
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:45,500
through the
tentacles like butter.

294
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:48,750
Conventional weapons barely
make a dent before bouncing off.

295
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:50,083
[SIO] But that's the advantage!

296
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:52,500
The Battleship Type
is essentially a mollusk.

297
00:17:52,583 --> 00:17:54,000
Hit the arms with
a round that's got

298
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,083
serious kinetic oomph,
and they'll respond

299
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:57,708
to the pressure by
changing shape just

300
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,375
long enough to
crush and detonate

302
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,625
Hell yes!
