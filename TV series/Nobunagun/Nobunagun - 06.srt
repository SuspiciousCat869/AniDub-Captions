[RESEARCHERS] Hm!

00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,208
Welp. Better let you
in on the lay o' things.

7
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:50,291
As of that swig,
you've got clearance

8
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:51,875
to know the lab's
dirty li'l secret.

9
00:00:51,958 --> 00:00:53,791
[GONDA] Oh yeah?

10
00:00:53,875 --> 00:00:55,041
Sounds fun.

That's the spirit!

12
00:00:57,958 --> 00:01:00,416
[RESEARCHER 6A] Yeah.
In all seriousness, though.

[GAUDÍ] Oh, sí.

143
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:38,208
Is anybody else
stationed here?

144
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,458
No.

145
00:08:39,541 --> 00:08:41,416
You're all alone, this
deep in the mountains?

146
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,125
The economy
being what it is,

had to cut corners.

I imagine you ladies have to go
toe-to-toe with those kaiju.

00:08:52,375 --> 00:08:54,833

an emergency landing, you said?

00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:12,416
By chance, were you
transporting--Kaiju?

Heh. Apologies, I mean
"Evolutionary Invaders."

we'd have to kill ya.

325
00:17:38,833 --> 00:17:41,833
I knew you had one of
my brethren in custody!

[GONDA laughs]

00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:47,875
Who are you?
Why are you doing this?

328
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:56,500
Look out!
It's breaking free!

329
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:59,041
There's a deadly
creature in there!

330
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:00,333
[GONDA] Look out?

331
00:18:00,416 --> 00:18:01,666
I think you'll find
this "creature"

332
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,875
and I have an understanding.

333
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:09,791
[GONDA] It's over.

334
00:18:09,875 --> 00:18:13,833
I won't be trussed up and
corralled like so much chattel.

335
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:16,583
Not by DOGOO.

336
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,208
Not by anyone!

337
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:24,541
No more shall my brothers
be subject to your butchery!

338
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,625
We shall be free!

[RESEARCHER 6A]
It was all a gag.

340
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,625
We were yanking
the idiot's chain.

341
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,916
Hell, even if you could get
something like that on the DL,

342
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,875
we'd never actually
feed it to anyone!

343
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:39,625
We tried to tell him, but he--

344
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:43,041
he just got it into his head,
and that was it.

Faster, Cyx!

[CYX] You got it!

355
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,708
I can't get that
close to him!

356
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,291
Then just get me as
close as you can!

357

Yah!

364
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:18,583
[CYX] I did everything
I could for him.

365
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:20,166
I'm sorry.

Thank you.

367
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:26,333
What sort of mind gets taken
in by a belief like that?

368
00:20:26,416 --> 00:20:29,083
The guy was destined
to become homicidal.

369
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,041
He should've been
locked away years ago!

370
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,458
It's not fair to make
that assumption.

371
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,333
We can't know what living
in this place does to a man.

372
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:39,583
Seclusion can play cruel tricks
on a person's sense of self.

373
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,583
That's no excuse!

There but for the
grace of god go us.

How well would our minds
hold up, I wonder?

376
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:50,625
The poor bastard.

Found you!

380

What are you fussing
over now, Gaudí?

381
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,833
Nothing! Just something
I worried I lost!

382
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,708
Must be pretty
valuable, huh?

Uh, well, it sure
is valuable to me.

Hm... Ah!

Is this
pornography?

It's not even mine.

00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,125
Ah. So I can
throw it out?

[GAUDÍ] No!

Okay, I'll level with you.

It is mine.

Please let me have it back!
