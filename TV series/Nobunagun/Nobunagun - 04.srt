1
00:00:13,166 --> 00:00:14,125
So, who's the
wreck in the chair

2
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:16,000
trying to squeeze
blood from rock?

3
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:18,416
I'm Robert Capa,
your hapless instructor.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:20,000
You're joking, right?

5
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:22,666
Do you not even understand
the concept of sniping?

6
00:00:22,750 --> 00:00:25,333
An E-Gene Holder is
combat-ready at all times!

7
00:00:25,416 --> 00:00:27,583
I'm not runnin' a health spa!

8
00:00:28,583 --> 00:00:31,541
I'm afraid the Commander
has certain expectations of you.

9
00:00:31,625 --> 00:00:33,875
Second Lieutenant
Harold S. Conway.

10
00:00:33,958 --> 00:00:36,666
Sorry, apparently
I've forgotten my manners.

11
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,458
There are ways around it,
if you want.

12
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,500
I mean, if you wander
down to the commons.

13
00:00:41,583 --> 00:00:42,791
[SOLDIER 3B]
The fact they brought you

14
00:00:42,875 --> 00:00:44,541
here in the first place means

15
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:45,916
you're certifiably
a cut above the average soldier.

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,583
[SOLDIER 3A] I think
somebody needs a second helping.

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,958
If you're looking to bond
with fun new people,

18
00:00:50,041 --> 00:00:51,958
your priorities need an enema.

19
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,375
Like bein' in a funhouse, ja?

20
00:00:54,458 --> 00:00:56,125
Figured you
could use the closure.

21
00:00:56,208 --> 00:00:59,125
Sure, treat 'em like a mirage
if you feel like bein' dead.

22
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:00,875
Aim ahead of your subject.

23
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:02,458
That?

24
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:03,750
Nothing.

25
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,208
Li'l something I shot
with your doppelgänger.

26
00:01:05,291 --> 00:01:06,416
Capa!

27
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,625
You dig the composition?

28
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:09,875
Bogies, sir!

29
00:01:09,958 --> 00:01:11,791
Good god.

30
00:01:11,875 --> 00:01:13,250
Don't tell me it's--!

31
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:15,041
[FEMALE OP 1B] D-101 appears
to have been shot down

32
00:01:15,125 --> 00:01:17,000
over the Gulf of Mexico while
on a hurricane recon mission.

33
00:01:17,083 --> 00:01:18,208
They--

34
00:01:18,291 --> 00:01:19,583
Please, no.

35
00:01:21,625 --> 00:01:23,916
[NARRATOR] "E-genes":
recombinant DNA strands

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,625
marked by their
ability to retain

37
00:01:26,708 --> 00:01:28,000
and selectively
manifest the essence

38
00:01:28,083 --> 00:01:30,166
of humanity's
greatest figures.

39
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:31,500
Known as E-Gene Holders,

40
00:01:31,583 --> 00:01:33,666
the inheritors of these
specialized strands

41
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:35,666
use AU spheres to
activate the abilities

42
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:38,958
lying dormant within themselves,
which then materialize

43
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:42,166
as physical weapons
of varying types.

44
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:44,000
What follows is
a record of the struggle

45
00:01:44,083 --> 00:01:46,208
between DOGOO,
a supranational organization

46
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:48,250
comprised of
trained E-Gene Holders,

47
00:01:48,333 --> 00:01:52,000
and mankind's greatest threat,
the Evolutionary Invaders.

48
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:55,250
Make no mistake:
the battle is on!

49
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,375
Gun Four: "Hurricane"!

50
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:42,500
[DOGOO] This is Hurricane Olga,
currently en route to Florida.

51
00:03:42,583 --> 00:03:45,000
A typical storm, or so it seems.

52
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:47,583
Yet observe what hides within.

53
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,083
Son-of-a-bitch.

54
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,208
Based on the final data from
the D-101 before we lost it,

55
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,250
this shadow is an EI.

56
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:58,083
Of that there is
no doubt, gentlemen.

57
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:02,083
Any sign of the crew, or do
we assume all hands were lost?

58
00:04:02,166 --> 00:04:04,666
There's been no
contact from any of them.

59
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:08,500
So, short of the Bermuda
Triangle having come into play--

60
00:04:08,583 --> 00:04:10,250
KIA it is.

61
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:17,875
I assume
the Evolutionary Invader

62
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,916
is using the hurricane to
make landfall within the U.S.

63
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,625
It is a little
more sophisticated

64
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,750
than the stunt
they pulled in Taiwan.

65
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:29,500
I gotta give the bastards
an A for originality.

66
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,250
This is no time
for levity, Capa.

67
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:35,041
The enemy is safe behind
a relentless wall of wind

68
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,250
spinning 60 meters per second.

69
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,083
And with every moment we delay,

70
00:04:39,166 --> 00:04:41,958
it's speeding closer
to the shores of America.

71
00:04:42,041 --> 00:04:45,500
The weather is prohibitively
rough for melee combat.

72
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:47,833
The only way to prevent
the EI from reaching land

73
00:04:47,916 --> 00:04:50,666
is to shoot it down
from long range.

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,208
And you think Little
Miss Playtime is good for it?

75
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,375
You oversee
her training regimen;

76
00:04:55,458 --> 00:04:57,541
is she ready for
this sort of task?

77
00:04:57,625 --> 00:04:58,875
I dunno.

78
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:01,083
There is an E-Gene Holder
somewhere in that girl.

79
00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:03,291
But until she stops
getting her ass handed to her

80
00:05:03,375 --> 00:05:07,583
by a mook in a chair, she's out
of her depth with fieldwork.

81
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,083
If that's the case,

82
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:11,625
perhaps we should give
this to another Holder.

83
00:05:11,708 --> 00:05:13,666
No.

84
00:05:13,750 --> 00:05:17,000
This target demands
the ministrations of a marksman.

85
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:20,125
As William Tell is indisposed
with another EI right now,

86
00:05:20,208 --> 00:05:22,250
our choice is clear.

87
00:05:22,333 --> 00:05:25,166
Sio it is, then.

88
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,541
She's all we have.

89
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,500
Jumping into battle like this.

90
00:05:34,583 --> 00:05:36,708
Can I hack it out there?

91
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,458
I dunno.

92
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:42,375
Ah!

93
00:05:47,375 --> 00:05:49,791
Pants so snug!

94
00:05:49,875 --> 00:05:53,375
I can't believe
I actually need to say this,

95
00:05:53,458 --> 00:05:54,458
but me eyes are up here.

96
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:55,500
I wasn't trying
to peep on you, I swear!

97
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,750
I just came
in here to get ready,

98
00:05:56,833 --> 00:05:58,375
minding my own business,
and you were half-naked!

99
00:05:58,458 --> 00:05:59,791
Whatever helps
you sleep at night.

100
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:01,708
--Suit up! 
--Okay.

101
00:06:04,625 --> 00:06:05,958
Your torso.

102
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,166
Are you uh--
y'know, okay to fight?

103
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,791
It's just a scratch.

104
00:06:10,875 --> 00:06:12,000
But what about you?

105
00:06:12,083 --> 00:06:13,000
Huh?

106
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,541
Capa's kicking your arse.

107
00:06:14,625 --> 00:06:19,416
Word's gatherin' steam you're
bollocks at basic training.

108
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,541
The only reason we have
the intel on that hurricane

109
00:06:22,625 --> 00:06:24,583
is 'cause those
guys did their jobs,

110
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:27,291
and laid down their
lives in the process.

111
00:06:27,375 --> 00:06:28,083
I swear.

112
00:06:28,166 --> 00:06:29,625
I'll avenge their deaths--

113
00:06:29,708 --> 00:06:32,166
Talk is cheap, rookie--
save it for the schoolyard.

114
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:37,541
Try not to slow me down.

115
00:06:41,083 --> 00:06:42,958
What is your deal?

116
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,333
Are all E-gene
Holders douchebags,

117
00:06:46,416 --> 00:06:47,875
or just the ones I've met?

118
00:06:47,958 --> 00:06:49,583
A well-adjusted,
stable girl like me

119
00:06:49,666 --> 00:06:52,333
should not have
to deal with this!

120
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,500
Also, maybe I shoulda
asked him how to put this on.

121
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,166
Get a move on, space-cadet!

122
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,041
Right! Coming!

123
00:07:12,125 --> 00:07:13,250
Meet Hurricane Olga.

124
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:14,458
915 hecto-pascals
of air pressure,

125
00:07:14,541 --> 00:07:18,125
wind speed 60
meters per second,

126
00:07:18,208 --> 00:07:20,958
and a 180 kilometer radius.

127
00:07:21,041 --> 00:07:24,208
Meteorologically speaking,
she's a stone cold bitch--

128
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:27,041
and the target's inside.

129
00:07:27,125 --> 00:07:28,458
It's having a fine old time,

130
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:29,833
whippin' 'round the perimeter
with its pectoral fins.

131
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:34,000
It's gonna ride the
hurricane for all it's worth.

132
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:36,125
Head as far inland as possible.

133
00:07:36,208 --> 00:07:38,916
We need to neutralize
it over the ocean,

134
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,041
but we can't go toe-to-toe
with those winds,

135
00:07:41,125 --> 00:07:43,916
and the tip of Florida's
spitting distance away.

136
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:50,458
That's why we're gonna shoot it
out of the sky from over here.

137
00:07:50,541 --> 00:07:52,083
All right, now the details.

138
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,833
Galileo, you'll be spotter.

139
00:07:53,916 --> 00:07:54,833
Capisco!

140
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:57,000
How'd it say that?

141
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,916
Suppose I should
introduce you two.

142
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Nobunagun, Galileo.

143
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:05,208
Sorry I called you an it!

144
00:08:09,875 --> 00:08:12,333
Anyway, have you
made our target yet?

145
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:13,416
Don't worry, sir.

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,125
I've got her in my sights.

147
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:19,916
She passes by our line of
fire 90 seconds from right now.

148
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,416
You're on point, rookie.

149
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,583
You'd better bring your A-game,
or this is all for naught.

150
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:37,541
Here comes!

151
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,250
Thar she blows.

152
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,833
If you can't put
a hole in that thing,

153
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:54,500
maybe we'd be better off trading
you in for Louis Braille.

154
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,500
Lucky for us,

155
00:08:56,583 --> 00:08:59,333
any hit should be enough
to knock it into the ocean.

156
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:00,750
Once it's down,

157
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,250
we turn it into chum courtesy
of Jack and his knife.

158
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:05,125
Aye-aye.

159
00:09:05,583 --> 00:09:07,083
Speaking of putting
holes in things,

160
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,750
try not to get turned into Jack
the Shish-Kabob this time, huh?

161
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:18,416
Looking at the EI's
heat-signature as it passed by,

162
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:21,208
it appears to be
carrying dozens of eggs!

163
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,791
Dozens of 'em?

164
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,166
Ah, bloody hell.

165
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:26,833
What does that mean?

166
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,416
If they hatch on dry land,

167
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:30,916
they'll be walking on
4 legs before you know it.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,125
Once those things can attack us
at home, that's all she wrote.

169
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:36,375
Let's say you wing the target.

170
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:38,750
The second you do, she's gonna
drop those eggs in the drink.

171
00:09:38,833 --> 00:09:41,458
That scenario's FUBAR already.

172
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:42,958
But from right here,

173
00:09:43,041 --> 00:09:45,958
some of those eggs are
gonna make it to the shoreline.

174
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:49,583
An area that's about to
be ravaged by the storm.

175
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:54,250
No way we'll find 'em
all before they hatch.

176
00:09:54,333 --> 00:09:55,416
What do we do?

177
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,791
Listen good.

178
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,416
She lays those eggs and
we're in one hell of a mess,

179
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,666
so we have to kill it
before she can react.

180
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,041
The target's far.

181
00:10:03,125 --> 00:10:04,625
It's moving at high speed.

182
00:10:04,708 --> 00:10:07,791
And you only get one shot.

183
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,166
HQ!

184
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:11,791
We were listening.

185
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:15,250
We've dissected the Evolutionary
Invader from the Palau attack.

186
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,875
During that process, we found
what passes for its brain,

187
00:10:18,958 --> 00:10:21,666
nestled between
the two posterior eyes.

188
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,250
Hitting a spot
like that won't be easy.

189
00:10:24,333 --> 00:10:26,166
Why would you even say that?

190
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,250
Are you trying to psyche me out?

191
00:10:29,333 --> 00:10:31,000
If the girl doesn't
think she can do it.

192
00:10:31,083 --> 00:10:32,291
Irrelevant.

193
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:34,625
Sio Ogura-- no.

194
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,291
Nobunagun.

195
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,875
You are the only
one who can do this.

196
00:10:45,833 --> 00:10:47,250
Relative velocity set!

197
00:10:47,333 --> 00:10:50,541
4 minutes 'til the target
re-enters our line of fire, sir!

198
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:52,041
You heard the astronomer.

199
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,958
Get ready.

200
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,208
I'm relaying the footage
from my scope over to Nobunagun.

201
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,541
I have adjusted for air
pressure and wind-sheer,

202
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,666
so the center of the scope

203
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:18,416
is where the bullet
will hit the EI.

204
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,583
One shot.

205
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,291
Our only shot.

206
00:11:21,375 --> 00:11:25,541
And if I miss,
like I did in Taiwan--

207
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,875
--more people
are gonna get hurt!

208
00:11:29,708 --> 00:11:30,833
Easy!

209
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:32,958
I haven't been training
you for fun, child.

210
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:35,583
Harness that power--
you're in charge.

211
00:11:35,666 --> 00:11:38,666
Nothing exists but you
and the target, understood?

212
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:41,291
Dammit!

213
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:43,250
Fine, just shut up
and let me concentrate!

214
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,541
Incoming, sir!

215
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:47,583
2 minutes until enemy contact!

216
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:54,041
She's lurching,
but so is the chopper.

217
00:11:55,083 --> 00:11:57,000
One shot, one kill.

218
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,625
No do-overs.

219
00:11:58,708 --> 00:11:59,666
This is it.

220
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,083
C'mon, Sio.

221
00:12:01,166 --> 00:12:03,375
Take it out!

222
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,125
She's choking.

223
00:12:08,208 --> 00:12:10,583
We're screwed.

224
00:12:11,541 --> 00:12:12,083
Please.

225
00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:13,208
Try to stay calm.

226
00:12:13,291 --> 00:12:17,416
Nobunagun!

227
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,916
My liege, please, be rational.

228
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Imagawa has 50,000 men!

229
00:12:22,083 --> 00:12:23,958
Whereas you have a mere 2,000!

230
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,583
Open combat will be
the death of us all!

231
00:12:26,666 --> 00:12:28,625
We're safer in the castle.

232
00:12:28,708 --> 00:12:33,500
From here, we can put out
the call for reinforcements.

233
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,416
Lord Nobunaga!

234
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,250
What news?

235
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:38,625
Sire!

236
00:12:38,708 --> 00:12:41,125
Imagawa's men have taken
provisions to Odaka Castle!

237
00:12:41,208 --> 00:12:46,708
Yoshimoto leaves Kutsukake,
and makes haste for Odaka.

238
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:47,791
Huh.

239
00:12:47,875 --> 00:12:50,166

the Nirmanarati Heaven."

243
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,291
What in the hell?

244
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:20,916

Okay.

Think!

253
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:54,500
Although, she does
catch serious wind.

254
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:57,041
I need to catch the wind!

255
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:59,125
The same current as her!

256
00:14:12,333 --> 00:14:13,750
She jumped into the storm!

257
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,791
I'm crippled,
dammit, not blind!

258
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:18,416
What does that wanker
think she's doing?

00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,083
Gotcha!

Perfect sync.

270
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:41,500

Wait, what?

277
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,125
This is bad!

278
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,416

The target's still up!

282
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:08,916
You said she nailed it!

283
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,750
How's that possible?

284
00:15:09,833 --> 00:15:12,125
She made the shot just fine,

285
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,791
but what she killed
was merely the transporter!

286
00:15:15,875 --> 00:15:19,625
Those eggs are being
held by a whole other EI!

287
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:23,000
Which means,
EIs can fuse together,

to make even better ones!

00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,916

weapon in their arsenal?

00:16:50,708 --> 00:16:52,166
'fore they touch down,

327
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,208
and you're gonna help me!

328
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:54,833
For reals?

329
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,208
They're so little!

330
00:16:56,291 --> 00:16:58,375
I don't even know if
I can hit something that size!

331
00:16:58,458 --> 00:17:01,000
But there's no
other choice; I gotta!

332
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:01,875
Wanker!

333
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:02,875
Huh?

334
00:17:02,958 --> 00:17:04,125
I'm gonna get the eggs.

335
00:17:04,208 --> 00:17:06,208
You're along for the ride.

336
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,750
So, what do I do?

337
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,500
Show me the goods, rookie!

338
00:17:09,583 --> 00:17:12,333
Deploy the Triple Volley!

339
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:15,083
Why're you holding me?

340
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:17,500
I'm sure Capa would tell
you to conserve your energy,

341
00:17:17,583 --> 00:17:19,375
but he's not here.

342
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,791
I want you to
give me all you've got.

343
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:22,000
Huh?

344
00:17:22,083 --> 00:17:24,541
Help me get down
there to get the job done.

345
00:17:24,625 --> 00:17:25,625
Help how?

346
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:27,375
Get me down to those eggs!

347
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,291
Oh!

348
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:29,291
Like that.

349
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,416
Right!

350
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:37,708
180 meters to
the first egg and closing!

351
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,208
Bearing is 2-4-0!

352
00:17:40,958 --> 00:17:41,708
There it is.

353
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,291
Fire right!

354
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:47,791
First egg is broken!

355
00:17:47,875 --> 00:17:48,875
Wanna do another?

356
00:17:48,958 --> 00:17:50,333
Hell, yeah!

357
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:52,333
New bearing: 6-3-3!

358
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:55,708
Target distance 200 meters,
12 o'clock low!

359
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:00,708
It's magnificent!

360
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,500
5 eggs down!

361
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,416
No, 6!

362
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,166
Wait, 7!

363
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:06,875
[MALE OP 1A] They're using
her guns for propulsion?

364
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:08,250
[FEMALE OP 1A] Unreal!

365
00:18:08,333 --> 00:18:09,875
They put on quite the show.

366
00:18:09,958 --> 00:18:11,625
I will give them that.

367
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,375
One's hatching!

368
00:18:18,041 --> 00:18:23,708
Jack, Nobunagun!

369
00:18:23,791 --> 00:18:26,541
Report!

370
00:18:27,750 --> 00:18:29,625
I think I've had enough fun!

371
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,125
Likewise.

372
00:18:31,208 --> 00:18:33,208
Take that!

373
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:51,791
All'a the eggs
have been eliminated!

374
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:57,583
We got 'em?

375
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:58,375
Yup.

376
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,208
Every single one.

377
00:19:00,625 --> 00:19:02,791
Glad to hear it.

378
00:19:03,458 --> 00:19:04,625
What's this nonsense?

379
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,666
Don't fall asleep up here!

380
00:19:10,666 --> 00:19:12,416
This girl.

381
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:19,666
Ah!

382
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:21,541
Found them, sir!

383
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:22,750
Hey, Jack!

384
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:23,958
Nobunagun!

385
00:19:24,041 --> 00:19:25,875
Are you two okay?

386
00:19:25,958 --> 00:19:28,708
I'm gonna have to go with "no."

387
00:19:29,083 --> 00:19:30,250
[FEMALE OP 1B]
Jack the Ripper and Nobunagun

388
00:19:30,333 --> 00:19:31,750
have been recovered, ma'am.

389
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,625
And the EIs they took down?

390
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,458
[MALE OP 1A]
I'll send a recon squad.

391
00:19:35,541 --> 00:19:39,166
Does something trouble you?

392
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:40,666
Indeed.

393
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:45,458
I rejoice that Florida is safe,
but why was it in danger?

394
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:46,916
That's a good question.

395
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,250
These EIs came
from the Atlantic.

396
00:19:49,333 --> 00:19:53,208
Does this mean the enemy has
broken through the Panama Canal?

397
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:54,625
Or perhaps--?

398
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:56,333
Worrisome, yes, but--

399
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:00,916
I was thinking about
what Capa said before.

400
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:03,083
Specifically, about how our foe

401
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:06,000
learned from its
failed conquest in Taiwan.

402
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,541
The first phase of their
plan is landfall, presumably.

403
00:20:10,625 --> 00:20:13,833
And their first
landfall was Taiwan.

404
00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,083
But we put a stop
to their invasion

405
00:20:16,166 --> 00:20:18,250
before they had
the chance to evolve

406
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,666
into terrestrial creatures.

407
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,500
Today, they tried to
ride a hurricane inland,

408
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,625
as though to avoid
the very type of battle

409
00:20:25,708 --> 00:20:27,958
they lost last time around.

410
00:20:28,041 --> 00:20:32,958
Learning is one thing, but
how does an EI off of Florida

411
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,958
learn about the Taiwan defeat?

412
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:39,375
We thought each region's foes

413
00:20:39,458 --> 00:20:42,291
were evolving in
reaction to local stimuli,

414
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:45,125
but it seems there is
a communications network,

415
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:49,416
and an overmind guiding
their evolutionary strategy.

416
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,541
Go ahead, you wankers,
laugh it up!

417
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:03,125
This isn't how it looks,
so get bent!

418
00:21:10,208 --> 00:21:11,666
You're nothing but trouble.

419
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:13,541
Y'know that, rook?

420
00:21:15,625 --> 00:21:22,041
Oh man, those EIs were up
to somethin' fishy, get it?

421
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:28,958
I'm back?

422
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,833
Huh, it's night.

423
00:21:40,041 --> 00:21:41,333
Dear Asao.

424
00:21:41,416 --> 00:21:42,958
Today was pretty crazy!

425
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:47,125
I had training,
and went on my first mission,

426
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:50,416
and kinda kicked some ass!

427
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,000
And there's this guy--

428
00:21:58,458 --> 00:22:00,208
There's so much
I wanna tell you about,

429
00:22:00,291 --> 00:22:02,708
but I gotta keep
it all bottled up!

430
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:05,833
How am I supposed
to live without texting?

431
00:22:05,916 --> 00:22:08,250
This totally sucks!

432
00:23:38,583 --> 00:23:39,916
So, Newton.

433
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,250
It will be fun to see
Nobunagun again, will it not?

434
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,958
Oh, absolutely!

435
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:44,750
Oh!

436
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:46,541
Down, girl!

437
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:48,458
Next time, Gun Five:
"The 2nd Platoon"!

438
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:52,791
Hope you're ready for me
to "Sio" you a good time!
