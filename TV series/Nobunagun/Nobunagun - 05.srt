There are two Holder platoons
stationed on each craft.

Don't worry about it.

Well. This is fascinating.

166
00:08:19,541 --> 00:08:21,458

Yes, Vidocq, sir!

From your particuliar
vantage point,

[GANDHI] You are

193

Not exactly!

market" for now!

195
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,208
[GANDHI laughs]

196
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,208
Apologies, but you're just too
adorable to resist teasing.

197
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,750
[SIO whimpers]

198
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,125
[GANDHI] I imagine Jess was
quite a shock to your system.

199
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,916
Uh. Kinda.

200
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,583
[GANDHI]
"Gropey" is her default setting,

201
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:31,083
as opposed to her
conduct in battle.

202
00:09:31,166 --> 00:09:33,458
[SIO] That's a little
hard to swallow.

203
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,541
[GANDHI] It's a
byproduct of our gift.

204
00:09:35,625 --> 00:09:39,125
Holders act on very different
impulses outside of the fray.

205
00:09:39,208 --> 00:09:42,333
Newton, for example,
is a cruel sadist.

206
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,083
While Jess is anything but.

207
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:46,875
She engages in lip-lock
with all and sundry.

208
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,458
I almost think she views
it as philanthropic.

209
00:09:49,541 --> 00:09:51,458
The tongue can be
a bit much, however.

210
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,625
You're saying she slips
everyone the tongue?

211
00:09:53,708 --> 00:09:55,708
So she and Jack aren't an item?

212
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:58,166
[GANDHI] By "item,"
you mean--

213
00:09:58,250 --> 00:10:00,875
Ah. Yes.
You like Adam.

214
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,166
Oh, please! Gross!
Boo! Whatever!

215
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,666
Then I misspoke?

216
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:08,333
Uh. Li'l bit, yeah!

217
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:11,125
[GANDHI] Splendid.
Then I have no competition.

218
00:10:11,208 --> 00:10:13,958
Whoa.
You--You're not seriously--?

219
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:17,208
You see, my demeanor changes
outside of battle as well.

220
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,750
Sometimes I like to
play the aggressor.

221
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:22,541
[SIO]
What is happening?

222
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:27,333
[GANDHI] Oh God.
Seems I've overdone it.

223
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:32,458
[DOGOO] I trust you gleaned
something useful?

224
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,291
Indeed.
I may have uncovered

225
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,458
a valid empirical basis
for your conjecture,

226
00:10:36,541 --> 00:10:38,625
vis-à-vis the enemy's
uncanny aptitude

227
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,708
for relaying information.

228
00:10:40,791 --> 00:10:42,125
[DOGOO]
You're certain of this?

229
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,083
M'sieur Hunter
dissected what was left

230
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,666
of the Florida carcass to
my exact specifications.

231
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:51,375
The cranial cavity displayed
a number of discreet chambers.

232
00:10:51,458 --> 00:10:53,291
Combined with what
may be safely presumed

233
00:10:53,375 --> 00:10:56,125
from close examination of
Sixth Platoon's Taiwan footage,

234
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,750
a hypothesis begins to form.

235
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,083
Observe.

236
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,083
These scattered fragments
give identical readings

237
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:04,791
to that of an EI.

238
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,583
Given they're
fragments of an EI,

239
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,500
I hardly find this surprising.

240
00:11:08,583 --> 00:11:10,833
Quite.
My thoughts exactly.

241
00:11:10,916 --> 00:11:12,708
Until I discovered
that each fragment

242
00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,458
is teeming with
distinct vital signs.

243
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,500
[DOGOO]
What are you suggesting?

244
00:11:17,583 --> 00:11:19,791
As I said, it is
a mere hypothesis.

245
00:11:19,875 --> 00:11:24,333
But the burden of proof
is easily satisfied.

00:21:32,625 --> 00:21:36,375
Allowing them to travel up the
food chain perfectly intact.

482
00:21:36,458 --> 00:21:39,750
Records of previous failures
travel the chain with them.

483
00:21:39,833 --> 00:21:41,458
Ergo, a new type is born

484
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,666
which builds on the memory
of its predecessor.

485
00:21:44,750 --> 00:21:47,291
[COMMANDER] So, this EI
is a messenger of sorts?

486
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,416
They speed up natural
selection geometrically.

487
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:55,250
These "messengers" are to thank
for their breakneck evolution.

488
00:21:55,333 --> 00:21:57,416
This is chilling
news, Vidocq.

489
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,916
[VIDOCQ] Indeed.

490
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:02,625
If the Invaders continue to
evolve at this pace, Ma'am--

491
00:22:02,708 --> 00:22:06,791
--they will surpass
humankind in a matter of weeks.

492
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,083
[CYX] Princess!
Your lovely clothes!

493
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,708
[GERONIMO] Don't make
such a fuss, Cyx!

494
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,041
[GAUDÍ] She's right,
Miss Geronimo!

495
00:23:43,125 --> 00:23:44,125
You're too reckless!

496
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:45,708
[CYX] You dare
criticize the princess?

497
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,166
[GERONIMO] Someone thinks
a lot of themselves!

498
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:48,416
[GAUDÍ squeals]

499
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:50,458
[GERONIMO] Next time,
Gun Six: "Monster Meat."

500
00:23:50,541 --> 00:23:52,541
[GAUDÍ] I'm sorry!
Forgive me!
