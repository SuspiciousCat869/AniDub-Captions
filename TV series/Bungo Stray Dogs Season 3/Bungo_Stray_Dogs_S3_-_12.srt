1
00:00:28,525 --> 00:00:31,233
[DJ] Our next request is
from <i>The Nutcracker Suite</i> :

2
00:00:31,317 --> 00:00:33,358
"Waltz of the Flowers."

3
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:40,567
[PUSHKIN] Yo, Ivan.
I carried out the orders.

4
00:00:43,317 --> 00:00:45,567
Hey, Ivan, you there?

5
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:47,067
Can you hear me?

6
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,192
Hey!

7
00:00:50,275 --> 00:00:51,983
Silence please.

8
00:00:52,067 --> 00:00:54,192
I'm not able to hear
my Tchaikovsky.

9
00:00:54,275 --> 00:00:56,192
[PUSHKIN]
Listening to the radio again?

10
00:00:56,275 --> 00:00:59,233
Look, I infected the
intruders with the virus.

11
00:00:59,317 --> 00:01:02,483
So... what's the next
order from the boss?

12
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:08,275
[FYODOR D.]
Hmm.

13
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:14,192
Our master instructs you to
do what you can to escape.

14
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,775
[PUSHKIN]
No backup?

15
00:01:15,858 --> 00:01:18,817
You know, if I get caught,
the virus'll be lost, too.

16
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:21,025
I have no intention
of protecting anyone

17
00:01:21,108 --> 00:01:22,775
but our master.

18
00:01:22,858 --> 00:01:24,650
[sighs, chuckles]

19
00:01:24,733 --> 00:01:26,400
I'm so blissed out.

20
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:27,942
Really?

21
00:01:28,025 --> 00:01:30,483
I'd give anything to be there
to see the look on your face

22
00:01:30,567 --> 00:01:31,775
when the bliss fades.

23
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:34,067
The look on my face, huh?

24
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:36,775
If the master were
to ask it of me,

25
00:01:36,858 --> 00:01:40,025
I would gladly peel it off
without a second thought.

26
00:01:40,108 --> 00:01:42,733
You are definitely a nutcase.

27
00:01:42,817 --> 00:01:43,983
[groans]

28
00:01:46,775 --> 00:01:48,692
[PUSHKIN]
Those bastards are after me.

29
00:01:48,775 --> 00:01:50,525
[chuckling]

30
00:01:50,608 --> 00:01:52,900
I'll see you on the surface.

31
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:03,025
[phone ringing]

32
00:02:06,775 --> 00:02:08,358
Finally. A connection.

33
00:02:08,442 --> 00:02:10,067
Go ahead, Dazai!

34
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:12,608
[OSAMU] I trust you're chasing
the gifted with the virus.

35
00:02:12,692 --> 00:02:15,567
His virus infects the victim
through open wounds.

36
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:18,942
The fever and the nausea make
it difficult to even stand up.

37
00:02:19,025 --> 00:02:21,942
Don't let it so much
as graze you.

38
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:24,400
I'll take care of Fyodor.

39
00:02:24,483 --> 00:02:27,442
Make sure you don't let that
gifted out of your sight.

40
00:02:32,525 --> 00:02:34,400
[PUSHKIN chuckling]

41
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,733
Damn it. Can't reach him.

42
00:02:36,817 --> 00:02:38,983
[PUSHKIN chuckles]

43
00:02:39,067 --> 00:02:40,317
[BOTH yell]

44
00:02:45,775 --> 00:02:47,192
Weretiger!

45
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:54,858
Akutagawa!

46
00:02:54,942 --> 00:02:56,983
Neither the wretched
dog nor the weretiger

47
00:02:57,067 --> 00:02:58,858
live up to their reputation.

48
00:02:58,942 --> 00:03:00,025
Huh?

49
00:03:01,608 --> 00:03:03,692
What in the hell is that?

50
00:03:03,775 --> 00:03:05,650
[AKUTAGAWA]
Go faster than him!

51
00:03:05,733 --> 00:03:07,567
You're quite the
rough ride, you know.

52
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:09,108
Shut up!

53
00:03:11,942 --> 00:03:13,317
Go left!

54
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,400
Right!

55
00:03:19,650 --> 00:03:20,442
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?!

56
00:03:20,525 --> 00:03:21,983
Pick up the pace!

57
00:03:27,067 --> 00:03:29,608
Don't think. Just run, you fool!

58
00:03:29,692 --> 00:03:32,275
Enough! You're not
paying for this ride!

59
00:03:36,608 --> 00:03:37,400
[ATSUSHI]
Got ya!

60
00:03:37,483 --> 00:03:39,317
You're too late.

61
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,692
[AKUTAGAWA]
Weretiger!

62
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,025
[ATSUSHI]
What is that?

63
00:03:49,108 --> 00:03:51,483
[PUSHKIN]
Catch ya later!

64
00:03:51,567 --> 00:03:53,025
Damn. He's getting away.

65
00:03:53,108 --> 00:03:54,900
[IVAN sighs]

66
00:03:54,983 --> 00:03:57,275
[IVAN]
I'm so fortunate.

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,400
[IVAN]
My wonderful master, Fyodor,

68
00:04:04,483 --> 00:04:07,358
has given me a very
important task,

69
00:04:07,442 --> 00:04:09,608
and it's an even
bigger responsibility

70
00:04:09,692 --> 00:04:11,400
than guarding him.

71
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,108
Prepare yourself, weretiger.

72
00:04:15,192 --> 00:04:17,567
We'll take him down
within a minute,

73
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,483
then go after the tram.

74
00:04:24,192 --> 00:04:25,733
Looks like they're
on the move.

75
00:04:25,817 --> 00:04:27,400
Dazai, three cars just left

76
00:04:27,483 --> 00:04:29,317
the abandoned mines
from the north.

77
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,942
Contact the surface team
and have them followed.

78
00:04:32,025 --> 00:04:32,983
Ignore them.

79
00:04:33,067 --> 00:04:34,650
[JUNICHIROU]
Uh--

80
00:04:34,733 --> 00:04:35,817
[OSAMU]
Those are decoys.

81
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,567
They're meant to slow us down.

82
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,650
But how can you be sure?

83
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:43,067
Because that's exactly
what I would do.

84
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:45,108
[JUNICHIROU]
Uh. Understood.

85
00:04:46,733 --> 00:04:50,317
Hey, Junichirou, a cargo truck's
leaving west of the mines.

86
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:51,525
[JUNICHIROU]
Could that be the one?

87
00:04:51,608 --> 00:04:53,275
[OSAMU]
No, it's not.

88
00:04:53,358 --> 00:04:55,233
Ignore it, too.

89
00:04:55,317 --> 00:04:56,942
[JUNICHIROU] Now we're seeing
several armed soldiers

90
00:04:57,025 --> 00:04:58,775
moving to the southeast.

91
00:04:58,858 --> 00:05:01,358
It looks like they're
escorting someone in a hood.

92
00:05:01,442 --> 00:05:02,525
[OSAMU]
Ignore them.

93
00:05:02,608 --> 00:05:04,108
Uh. Really? But, what if--?

94
00:05:04,192 --> 00:05:06,692
[OSAMU]
We're trying to capture a demon.

95
00:05:06,775 --> 00:05:11,358
We need every hand we
can spare. Ignore them.

96
00:05:11,442 --> 00:05:12,858
[yells]

97
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,358
[IVAN laughs]

98
00:05:22,442 --> 00:05:24,608
[IVAN]
You're wasting your time.

99
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:29,525
My ability allows me to
manipulate the earth.

100
00:05:29,608 --> 00:05:31,608
There's no amount
of cutting or crushing

101
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:34,733
that could ever defeat
my stone giant.

102
00:05:38,942 --> 00:05:40,317
Weretiger!

103
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,442
[IVAN]
Keep this in mind, too.

104
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:48,983
You're now trapped in
the belly of my ability.

105
00:05:49,067 --> 00:05:53,150
Even the ground upon which
you stand is your enemy.

106
00:05:53,233 --> 00:05:54,358
[gasps]

107
00:05:54,442 --> 00:05:57,025
[IVAN] I'm impressed
you survived my blow,

108
00:05:57,108 --> 00:06:00,275
with only the mere
ability of the weretiger.

109
00:06:00,358 --> 00:06:02,817
It seems that there's a
lot more pain to be had

110
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:06,733
before we can reach an
equal amount of happiness.

111
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:09,775
[ATSUSHI] If we can't
defeat the stone giant,

112
00:06:09,858 --> 00:06:12,025
we'll have to go after
the gifted himself.

113
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:13,567
But if this ground
can be controlled

114
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:18,150
by his special ability, just
getting close will be difficult.

115
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:20,358
Our only choice is...

116
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,108
Akutagawa.

117
00:06:23,192 --> 00:06:24,442
[AKUTAGAWA]
Yeah.

118
00:06:25,817 --> 00:06:28,150
[ATSUSHI] Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

119
00:06:28,233 --> 00:06:29,692
[AKUTAGAWA]
Of course.

120
00:06:29,775 --> 00:06:33,025
How many times do you think
we've tried to kill each other?

121
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,483
You stay here, you lunatic.

122
00:06:35,567 --> 00:06:38,067
And you keep running, idiot.

123
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:41,192
It's no use!

124
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:51,233
What?

125
00:06:54,525 --> 00:06:56,192
It can't be...

126
00:07:03,108 --> 00:07:05,608
[IVAN] He's using the black
cloth like a foothold

127
00:07:05,692 --> 00:07:07,942
to avoid touching the earth.

128
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:11,858
I can't tell where he is!

129
00:07:13,067 --> 00:07:14,192
[ATSUSHI]
Gotcha!

130
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:22,442
[chuckles]

131
00:07:22,525 --> 00:07:26,358
[laughing]

132
00:07:26,442 --> 00:07:28,442
[IVAN] I'll create
a fully enclosed defense

133
00:07:28,525 --> 00:07:30,442
using fast-spinning rocks.

134
00:07:30,525 --> 00:07:32,358
If I can't tell where
you're coming from,

135
00:07:32,442 --> 00:07:35,192
I'll just protect myself
in all directions.

136
00:07:35,275 --> 00:07:38,733
Now, wretched dog,
it's your turn!

137
00:07:49,817 --> 00:07:51,400
[AKUTAGAWA] "Even the ground
upon which you stand

138
00:07:51,483 --> 00:07:52,900
is your enemy."

139
00:07:52,983 --> 00:07:55,608
I'm afraid to say I've
said those same words

140
00:07:55,692 --> 00:07:58,317
to my enemies countless times.

141
00:08:04,192 --> 00:08:07,358
[ATSUSHI]
Damn it. You used me as bait.

142
00:08:07,442 --> 00:08:08,525
You're the one who charged in

143
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:10,900
knowing full well
that'd be the case.

144
00:08:10,983 --> 00:08:12,442
Of course I knew it.

145
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,358
"How many times have we
tried to kill each other?"

146
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,317
[AKUTAGAWA] Mmm. Let's go
after the tram, weretiger.

147
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:19,233
Be my horse.

148
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,692
Oh, c'mon! Not that ag--

149
00:08:21,775 --> 00:08:23,067
[AKUTAGAWA]
Weretiger!

150
00:08:26,233 --> 00:08:27,733
[AKUTAGAWA]
It's a golem.

151
00:08:27,817 --> 00:08:30,400
It's just a fake.

152
00:08:30,483 --> 00:08:31,650
[AKUTAGAWA gasps]

153
00:08:34,108 --> 00:08:36,525
Oh, no. It's the virus.

154
00:08:36,608 --> 00:08:39,150
[IVAN] My generous master
is the only one

155
00:08:39,233 --> 00:08:43,067
who brings joy to
this godless world.

156
00:08:43,150 --> 00:08:46,108
Evil are those who
stand in his way.

157
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:49,817
I just infected you with the
virus through your wound.

158
00:08:52,858 --> 00:08:54,983
I barely have any strength left.

159
00:08:55,067 --> 00:08:56,608
I can't go on.

160
00:08:56,692 --> 00:08:59,442
And I can't chase that tram,
even if we do beat him.

161
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:03,150
[laughing]

162
00:09:03,233 --> 00:09:05,400
[JUNICHIROU] Dazai, there's
an unidentified helicopter

163
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:07,192
approaching from the east.

164
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:09,817
There's no way we can fight
them with our equipment.

165
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,983
Call in the military police!

166
00:09:12,067 --> 00:09:13,608
Copter?

167
00:09:13,692 --> 00:09:15,775
Do you see anybody
on the ground there?

168
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:16,900
[JUNICHIROU]
Hold on.

169
00:09:16,983 --> 00:09:18,608
Kenji, are there any
people down there?

170
00:09:18,692 --> 00:09:22,233
Looks like there's a hiker
at the base of the mountain.

171
00:09:22,317 --> 00:09:24,650
I can't see his face
'cause he's wearing a hat.

172
00:09:24,733 --> 00:09:25,650
[OSAMU]
He's the one!

173
00:09:25,733 --> 00:09:27,442
Huh?

174
00:09:27,525 --> 00:09:29,650
Do all you can to
stop that hiker.

175
00:09:29,733 --> 00:09:32,025
Send in Mori's men,
too, immediately.

176
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:33,900
[JUNICHIROU]
Uh. Got it.

177
00:09:40,525 --> 00:09:42,192
[JUNICHIROU]
Dazai, it's not him!

178
00:09:42,275 --> 00:09:44,817
It's a normal guy, handcuffed
with grenades in his mouth!

179
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:46,442
It's not Fyodor!

[gasps]

181
00:09:53,775 --> 00:09:56,525
[IVAN]
You two are surprisingly strong.

182
00:09:56,608 --> 00:09:59,442
It looks like there's
no end in sight.

183
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:02,442
[BOTH gasp]

184
00:10:02,525 --> 00:10:05,608
[IVAN] I guess I'll just
have to drown you slowly.

185
00:10:05,692 --> 00:10:06,775
[ATSUSHI]
My body's sinking

186
00:10:06,858 --> 00:10:09,317
and I don't have the
strength to escape.

187
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,525
Bye now.

188
00:10:14,692 --> 00:10:16,067
Oh, shit.

189
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:17,608
[AKUTAGAWA]
Weretiger.

190
00:10:18,692 --> 00:10:22,733
Answer my question from earlier.
Tell me why it is you fight.

191
00:10:22,817 --> 00:10:25,025
We don't have time for that now!

192
00:10:25,108 --> 00:10:29,358
There's still a way for us to
escape. It's our last resort.

193
00:10:29,442 --> 00:10:31,650
But you must answer me first.

194
00:10:31,733 --> 00:10:34,275
Why do you fight?

195
00:10:34,358 --> 00:10:37,900
You know the answer
to that question.

196
00:10:37,983 --> 00:10:39,567
[ORPHANAGE MAN 1]
Those who cannot save others

197
00:10:39,650 --> 00:10:41,608
do not deserve to live.

198
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:44,317
[AKUTAGAWA] You fight to escape
your childhood memories.

199
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,733
You fight so that you can
earn the right to live.

200
00:10:47,817 --> 00:10:52,233
Except I heard that your
childhood master died.

201
00:10:52,317 --> 00:10:53,942
No, he's not dead.

202
00:10:54,025 --> 00:10:56,067
He's standing behind
you right now.

203
00:10:56,150 --> 00:10:57,317
[AKUTAGAWA gasps]

204
00:11:00,983 --> 00:11:03,942
[ATSUSHI] He will always
be alive inside my head.

205
00:11:05,025 --> 00:11:06,692
His words keep repeating.

206
00:11:06,775 --> 00:11:09,483
All I can hear is,
"Do what's right."

207
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:13,358
I'll never get revenge against
someone who is dead.

208
00:11:13,442 --> 00:11:15,858
[AKUTAGAWA]
Hm. That's rather brutal.

209
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:19,150
It makes my death seem
trivial by comparison.

210
00:11:23,317 --> 00:11:24,817
What the hell?!

211
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:26,567
[AKUTAGAWA]
If I'm a wretched dog,

212
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:28,942
then you're a wandering dog.

213
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:31,733
This is the solution
to our problem.

214
00:11:31,817 --> 00:11:35,317
So you'd better fight
and give me that answer!

215
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:37,817
'Cause if you lose like this...

216

...I'll never forgive you.

[IVAN gasps]

219
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:50,025
[IVAN]
One of them has escaped!

220
00:11:50,108 --> 00:11:53,067
The ground is missing,
space and all!

221
00:11:57,650 --> 00:11:58,692
[gasps]

222
00:12:01,608 --> 00:12:03,400
[IVAN]
Teleportation.

223
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:06,400
He carved out space
with his ability...

224
00:12:06,483 --> 00:12:08,442
...and was able to move!

225
00:12:14,733 --> 00:12:15,983
[AKUTAGAWA]
Don't bother.

226

[gasps]

227
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:24,858
He just carved up my
stone like it was paper.

228
00:12:24,942 --> 00:12:26,858
[AKUTAGAWA] Only those
who've tried to kill him

229
00:12:26,942 --> 00:12:29,150
know what he is capable of.

230
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,108
It's his tiger claws.

231
00:12:31,192 --> 00:12:34,192
They cut through the very
fabric of an ability.

232
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:37,983
Therefore, by expanding
and contracting the space,

233
00:12:38,067 --> 00:12:39,400
he detached.

234
00:12:39,483 --> 00:12:41,317
He did the very same thing

235
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,025
when he cut through
my Rashoumon.

[screaming]

237

[AKUTAGAWA] Our abilities have
become a unrivaled sword!

238
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,025
Physical armor and powers
are defenseless against it.

Let's go, Akutagawa!

240
00:12:59,983 --> 00:13:02,733

Fyodor and the Rats in
the House of the Dead

are all tools for
my entertainment.

Ha, ha, ha!

00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:52,317
Weak men like me can
get away with anything!

See? Just as I said.

257
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:07,233
[YUKICHI]
What a simplistic escape plan.

258
00:14:07,317 --> 00:14:10,067
Far too predictable
when compared to Fyodor.

259
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:11,942
He's the master of phantoms.

260
00:14:12,025 --> 00:14:14,150
It's not possible!

[DOPPO] Well, we were all put
in grave danger because of you.

What have you got
to say for yourself?

[PUSHKIN] Forgive me! I'll
disable the virus right away!

I'll turn myself in! Please!

265
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:29,400
I suppose that's a good
enough apology for now.

266
00:14:29,483 --> 00:14:31,858
Yes, let's forgive him.

[YUKICHI, OUGAI]
Absolutely no chance!

The virus is gone.

That must mean the
mission was successful.

00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,525
[DOPPO]
Fyodor's missing?

273

[ATSUSHI] Yeah, he's
nowhere to be found.

274
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,733
[DOPPO]
He wasn't in the helicopter

00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:04,525
or in the escape vehicles.

00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:07,692
He must still be in
his hideout then.

I'm just happy.

I'm consistently
overcome with pure joy.

My master removed the part
of me that feels unhappiness.

00:15:23,483 --> 00:15:26,775
Tell me, did anyone
ever once guarantee you

284
00:15:26,858 --> 00:15:30,483
that capturing this base would
actually lead you to my master?

285
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:31,442
What's that?

286
00:15:31,525 --> 00:15:33,108
No way.

00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:40,067
[WAITER]
Would you like more tea?

288

I don't think so,
but thank you very much.

289
00:15:49,567 --> 00:15:51,275
[AKUTAGAWA]
So are you suggesting

290
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,442
he was never even
here to begin with?!

291

[laughing]

292
00:15:55,983 --> 00:15:57,358
Impossible.

293
00:15:57,442 --> 00:16:00,150
There's no connection
to the outside world.

294
00:16:00,233 --> 00:16:02,358
We've been monitoring
all communications

295
00:16:02,442 --> 00:16:03,900
with a hacking ability,

296
00:16:03,983 --> 00:16:07,317
and this place can't be
manipulated from the outside.

297
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,275
All you have to do
is listen to the music.

298
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:12,692
Music?

299
00:16:12,775 --> 00:16:15,108
[IVAN] The requests being
made on this music program

300
00:16:15,192 --> 00:16:19,192
are serving as a secret language
so he can relay his orders.

301
00:16:19,275 --> 00:16:21,692
Our communications
make brilliant use

302
00:16:21,775 --> 00:16:24,233
of all the radio waves
throughout the air.

303
00:16:24,317 --> 00:16:26,900
No amount of hacking
can stop us.

304
00:16:26,983 --> 00:16:30,400
So you can see now how you'd
already lost from the beginning!

305
00:16:30,483 --> 00:16:33,817
[DOPPO]
Atsushi, what's going on?

306
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:35,067
Mr. Kunikida.

307
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:36,483
[DOPPO]
What?

308
00:16:38,233 --> 00:16:41,817
[ATSUSHI] The Rat is
already outside the hole.

309
00:16:46,275 --> 00:16:49,233
The "St. Matthew
Passion" by Bach.

310
00:16:49,317 --> 00:16:51,983
It seems my time is up.

311
00:16:52,067 --> 00:16:56,192
Still, they weren't nearly as
formidable as I'd thought.

312
00:16:56,275 --> 00:16:58,900
It looks like I'll be
able to eliminate them

313
00:16:58,983 --> 00:17:01,358
with my next move.

314
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:17,108
Hey there. Nice café, huh?

315
00:17:17,192 --> 00:17:18,400
[FYODOR D.]
Huh?

316
00:17:20,192 --> 00:17:23,275
I've never seen you look
so shocked before.

317
00:17:24,650 --> 00:17:26,692
Don't you want to know
how I found you?

318
00:17:26,775 --> 00:17:28,775
I really played my cards right.

319
00:17:28,858 --> 00:17:30,400
[FYODOR D. gasps]

320
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:33,567
And my best card was
right in front of me.

321
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:36,358
I couldn't have asked for
a better card than this.

322
00:17:36,442 --> 00:17:39,233
He's the one who
caught the demon.

323
00:17:39,317 --> 00:17:40,817
[chuckles]

324
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:43,608
It's been a long time, you Rat.

325
00:17:43,692 --> 00:17:45,608
[chuckles]

326
00:17:45,692 --> 00:17:47,900
This is excellent!

327
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:49,942
You used Eyes of God?

328
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:51,900
[OSAMU]
That's right.

329
00:17:51,983 --> 00:17:55,067
The inescapable eyes that
integrate surveillance footage

330
00:17:55,150 --> 00:17:57,025
from all over the city.

331
00:17:57,108 --> 00:17:59,108
It's extremely helpful.

332
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:01,358
I used that power
to find this place

333
00:18:01,442 --> 00:18:04,358
while you were
distracted by your base.

334
00:18:05,525 --> 00:18:07,233
He helped us on the
condition we'd take back

335
00:18:07,317 --> 00:18:10,025
the Guild's hidden assets,
which you stole.

336
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,775
I have no interest in
money once it's gone,

337
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:15,567
but my pride wouldn't allow
me to leave it with Rats.

338
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:16,483
[footsteps]

339
00:18:16,567 --> 00:18:17,567
[FITZGERALD]
Hm?

340
00:18:22,192 --> 00:18:25,442
Don't anybody move.
We'll take it from here.

341
00:18:25,525 --> 00:18:28,650
If that's all right
with you? Huh, Dazai?

342
00:18:28,733 --> 00:18:32,733
[OSAMU] Sure. That's
why I called you here.

343
00:18:32,817 --> 00:18:35,150
[ANGO] Put your hands
where we can see them.

344
00:18:38,692 --> 00:18:39,900
[gasps]

345
00:18:39,983 --> 00:18:41,858
Wait, don't touch him!

346
00:18:41,942 --> 00:18:43,317
[FYODOR D. chuckles]

347
00:18:52,358 --> 00:18:53,817
He's dead.

348
00:18:56,817 --> 00:19:00,192
If you try anything else,
we'll shoot you on the spot.

349
00:19:00,275 --> 00:19:01,775
That's fine.

350
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:05,317
Let's get going then.

351
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,525
[FITZGERALD]
Detective.

352
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:12,317
Do you have any idea
what his ability is?

353
00:19:14,442 --> 00:19:17,942
No, sir. I don't.

354
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:34,942
This is really bad.

355
00:19:35,025 --> 00:19:37,233
Yes, it is.

356
00:19:37,317 --> 00:19:38,942
Are you sure it's bad?

357
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:41,067
We straight up disobeyed
the president's orders

358
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:42,817
not to fight the Port Mafia.

359
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:46,192
If that's not a bad thing,
I don't know what is!

360
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:48,108
We could get the ax.

361
00:19:48,192 --> 00:19:50,983
Really?! I've never
gotten the ax before!

362
00:19:51,067 --> 00:19:52,150
[JUNICHIROU]
Yeah...

363
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,525
Do you know what it
means to get the ax?

364
00:19:54,608 --> 00:19:56,275
I know what it means.

365
00:19:56,358 --> 00:19:58,983
Several people were axed
at my previous job.

366
00:19:59,067 --> 00:20:01,150
It was a pain to
clean up the mess.

367
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,900
Oh, forget it. She doesn't know
what the word means, either.

368
00:20:03,983 --> 00:20:07,192
[RAMPO]
Ooh! Look at all these snacks!

369
00:20:07,275 --> 00:20:08,692
[JUNICHIROU]
Rampo!

370
00:20:10,233 --> 00:20:13,275
I see that you made it
out of the mystery novel.

371
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:17,400
Of course. I identified
all 500 criminals.

372
00:20:17,483 --> 00:20:19,442
Mr. Fancy Hat's still inside.

373
00:20:19,525 --> 00:20:20,692
He gave up on the mystery novel

374
00:20:20,775 --> 00:20:22,858
and just started
beating everyone up.

375
00:20:25,067 --> 00:20:26,650
It's the president.

376
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:36,067
[DOPPO] We will accept any
punishment to the full extent.

377
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:39,483
[YUKICHI] Your punishment will
be determined at a later date.

378
00:20:40,650 --> 00:20:42,067
[YUKICHI]
But I am deeply grateful

379
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:44,608
for your work on this matter.

380
00:20:44,692 --> 00:20:45,817
[GROUP]
Huh?

381
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:54,442
[YUKICHI] Well done,
everyone. Very well done.

382
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,442
I've never seen such
a beautiful place before.

383
00:21:02,525 --> 00:21:05,067
[OSAMU]
Yeah. It's a fine ship.

384
00:21:18,567 --> 00:21:19,358
[OSAMU]
Atsushi.

385
00:21:19,442 --> 00:21:20,650
Yes?

386
00:21:20,733 --> 00:21:23,483
[OSAMU] How was it working
alongside Akutagawa?

387
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:24,900
[ATSUSHI]
It was awful.

388
00:21:24,983 --> 00:21:26,817
I never wanna partner
with him again.

389
00:21:26,900 --> 00:21:28,400
[OSAMU chuckles]

390
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:29,692
And why's that?

391
00:21:29,775 --> 00:21:33,025
[ATSUSHI]
We're completely incompatible.

392
00:21:33,108 --> 00:21:37,775
He's so short sighted.
Besides...

393
00:21:37,858 --> 00:21:39,692
[AKUTAGAWA]
In six months...

394
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:41,442
...I'm going to kill you.

395
00:21:41,525 --> 00:21:43,442
Prepare yourself well.

396
00:21:43,525 --> 00:21:46,317
When we first fought
each other on the ship,

397
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,400
I utterly despised you for
being so incredibly fortunate.

398
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:53,275
But I see you somewhat
differently now.

399
00:21:53,358 --> 00:21:55,067
However, until I defeat you,

400
00:21:55,150 --> 00:21:57,942
it will be impossible
for me to move on.

401
00:21:58,025 --> 00:22:00,942
And so... you must die.

402
00:22:01,025 --> 00:22:03,483
[OSAMU]
What'd you tell him?

403
00:22:03,567 --> 00:22:05,650
[ATSUSHI]
Oh, c'mon, Dazai.

404
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:08,858
I'm sure you can
guess what I said.

405
00:22:08,942 --> 00:22:12,150
[OSAMU]
Yes, I have a vague idea.

406
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,275
[ATSUSHI]
All right.

407
00:22:14,358 --> 00:22:16,108
But on one condition.

408
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:19,567
Don't kill anyone for
the next six months.

409
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:21,108
Hopefully there's
a simple lesson

410
00:22:21,192 --> 00:22:23,150
you'll take away from that.

411
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:27,483
You might finally learn
how to win Dazai's approval.

412
00:22:27,567 --> 00:22:29,317
And the fact that
weakness and strength

413
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,358
aren't always what they seem.

414
00:22:32,483 --> 00:22:36,692
You might also figure out
you're already ahead of me.

415
00:22:39,108 --> 00:22:40,608
[AKUTAGAWA]
Very well.

416
00:22:44,233 --> 00:22:46,233
[ATSUSHI]
I'll get stronger.

417
00:22:46,317 --> 00:22:49,483
I'll ask Mr. Kunikida
to teach me to fight,

418
00:22:49,567 --> 00:22:52,650
and I'll train to control
my ability better,

419
00:22:52,733 --> 00:22:54,817
so I can face down
Akutagawa's strength

420
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,900
six months from now.

421
00:22:58,483 --> 00:23:00,150
[ATSUSHI]
And then,

422
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:04,108
I can be freed from the
shackles of that bind me.

423
00:23:04,192 --> 00:23:06,942
I figured you'd say
something like that.

424
00:23:07,025 --> 00:23:08,317
Huh?

425
00:23:11,775 --> 00:23:16,067
[OSAMU] A Mafia member
who doesn't kill, huh?

426
00:23:16,150 --> 00:23:18,858
You and Akutagawa
are both fighters.

427
00:23:21,025 --> 00:23:22,858
[OSAMU]
Just like the rest of us.

428
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:30,483
Raise your glass.

429
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:31,650
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

430
00:23:32,817 --> 00:23:35,108
All right, but what
are we toasting to?

431
00:23:35,192 --> 00:23:37,108
Heh.

432
00:23:37,192 --> 00:23:39,358
To the Stray Dogs.

433
00:23:43,692 --> 00:23:45,775
[ATSUSHI]
To the Stray Dogs.
