1
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:44,817
[YUKICHI]
Hm?

2
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,400
Blood stains.

3
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,192
[YUKICHI]
The trail stops at this puddle.

4
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,358
[YUKICHI]
Dangerous night, isn't it?

5
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:26,108
[YUKICHI]
Curious skill you have there,

6
00:01:26,192 --> 00:01:28,567
being able to kick
off of nothing.

7
00:01:30,233 --> 00:01:32,900
[MASKED MAN]
Death to the gifted.

8
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:36,442
May they fall into
an eternal slumber.

9
00:01:36,525 --> 00:01:39,317
[YUKICHI]
A gifted-assassin.

10
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,150
Since I am not your only target,

11
00:01:42,233 --> 00:01:45,567
I will have to stop you here.

12
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:47,525
[MASKED MAN]
You can't get to me.

13
00:01:47,608 --> 00:01:50,317
You'll never even
be able to reach me.

14
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,983
While your skills in
martial arts are masterful,

15
00:01:53,067 --> 00:01:56,400
even you can't evade
what you cannot see.

16
00:02:00,483 --> 00:02:03,525
[YUKICHI] An attack from
a vacant dead-end?

17
00:02:03,608 --> 00:02:06,358
[MASKED MAN] You seem to
have detected my bloodlust.

18
00:02:06,442 --> 00:02:09,233
But this will suffice.

19
00:02:09,317 --> 00:02:13,358
Death lies in wait
everywhere, inescapable.

20
00:02:13,442 --> 00:02:18,400
It may arrive by gunshot,
by disease, by loneliness...

21
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:21,400
...or in your case, by poison.

22
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:30,858
[YUKICHI]
Ugh! Stop!

23
00:02:34,483 --> 00:02:36,567
[MASKED MAN chuckles]

24
00:02:38,067 --> 00:02:41,192
[MASKED MAN]
It is a good night to die

25
00:02:41,275 --> 00:02:44,275
underneath this pale moonlight.

26
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:18,775
[ATSUSHI] Is it true the
president was attacked?!

27
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,775
Yeah. He's unconscious
right now.

28
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:24,525
He's suffering from
mysterious injuries.

29
00:04:24,608 --> 00:04:28,358
His condition isn't improving,
despite Yosano's ability.

30
00:04:29,525 --> 00:04:31,525
[OSAMU]
From what I understand,

31
00:04:31,608 --> 00:04:33,358
there have been a lot
of attacks lately

32
00:04:33,442 --> 00:04:35,400
that are similar to this one.

33
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:38,775
Gifted people attacked at night,
with no one around to see.

34
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:41,150
Some of them have already died.

35
00:04:41,233 --> 00:04:43,025
What do we know of the attacker?

36
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,275
[OSAMU] Only that they
use an unknown ability,

37
00:04:45,358 --> 00:04:49,025
and always wear a mask
to conceal their face.

38
00:04:49,108 --> 00:04:51,358
Some kind of masked assassin.

39
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:52,692
Probably.

40
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,817
But by the time we
actually track him down,

41
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,983
this mysterious attacker
might already be dead.

42
00:04:58,067 --> 00:04:59,858
Which organization
do you think stands

43
00:04:59,942 --> 00:05:02,025
to lose the most
if a gifted-assassin

44
00:05:02,108 --> 00:05:05,275
were to go on a
massacre here, Atsushi?

45
00:05:07,108 --> 00:05:08,942
Special Operations Division?

46
00:05:09,025 --> 00:05:11,233
You'd think that'd be
the case, wouldn't you?

47
00:05:11,317 --> 00:05:14,108
But it's actually
the Port Mafia.

48
00:05:14,192 --> 00:05:16,442
The Port Mafia is
widely regarded

49
00:05:16,525 --> 00:05:18,442
as the "Masters of the Night."

50
00:05:18,525 --> 00:05:21,608
Their success is due to
the power of their members.

51
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,608
They can't afford to have
someone out there

52
00:05:23,692 --> 00:05:26,275
killing ability users unchecked.

53
00:05:26,358 --> 00:05:28,483
Imagine if one of their
own were to fall victim

54
00:05:28,567 --> 00:05:30,108
to these attacks.

55
00:05:30,192 --> 00:05:34,400
For starters, their credibility
would come tumbling down, fast.

56
00:05:34,483 --> 00:05:38,108
Till then, will they wait
while others get attacked?

57
00:05:38,192 --> 00:05:40,483
"The first to
make a move wins."

58
00:05:40,567 --> 00:05:43,108
That's what Mori
would always say.

59
00:05:43,192 --> 00:05:45,900
They won't wait to act.

60
00:05:45,983 --> 00:05:48,275
Truth is, they may have
already discovered

61
00:05:48,358 --> 00:05:50,817
the attacker's hideout by now.

62
00:05:58,775 --> 00:05:59,567
[MICHIZOU grunts]

63
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:01,275
We just barely missed them.

64
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:04,650
[HIROTSU] Boss, the place has
been completely deserted.

65
00:06:04,733 --> 00:06:08,400
[OUGAI] So they're good
at playing tag, it seems.

66
00:06:08,483 --> 00:06:09,983
That's fine.

67
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:13,567
They may have fast feet, but the
culprit isn't going to be able

68
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:15,942
to run from the Night forever.

69
00:06:16,025 --> 00:06:18,067
Can we go to the
candy store now?

70
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:20,358
We're almost there, Elise dear.

71
00:06:20,442 --> 00:06:22,942
There's just one other
place I wanna take you.

72
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:26,150
Not another clothing store.
That'll make 15!

73
00:06:26,233 --> 00:06:28,275
It's only a short distance away.

74
00:06:28,358 --> 00:06:31,275
I'll be able to die a happy
man if you do this for me.

00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:32,858
[ELISE grumbles]

00:06:32,942 --> 00:06:35,317
Fine, die happy then!

Oh!

Uh, right. Now where were we?

00:06:44,817 --> 00:06:47,358
[HIROTSU] Has the trap
been set as planned?

81
00:06:47,442 --> 00:06:51,608
Indeed. The assassin will
soon make his next move.

82
00:06:51,692 --> 00:06:53,733
That's when we'll catch him.

83
00:06:55,067 --> 00:06:57,108
Thanks for waiting, Elise.

84
00:06:57,192 --> 00:06:59,317
All right, let's go!

[PEOPLE gasp]

86
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:16,817
This is the alleyway where
the president was attacked.

87
00:07:20,442 --> 00:07:24,525
He must've been drawn in
by these blood splotches.

88
00:07:24,608 --> 00:07:27,483
Where did they come from?

89
00:07:27,567 --> 00:07:31,067
An attack in a
deserted dead-end.

90
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:35,233
From a gifted who
appeared to walk on air.

91
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,900
Now it makes sense.
That's who the attacker is.

92
00:07:55,192 --> 00:07:57,317
Wow. This really sucks.

93
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,108
Thank you, Elise.
You're the best.

94
00:08:00,192 --> 00:08:02,275
But you're--you're choking me.

It's me.

[AKUTAGAWA]
As you expected, Boss,

102
00:08:16,942 --> 00:08:19,858
our prey has taken the bait.

103
00:08:19,942 --> 00:08:24,067
[OUGAI] Then let him take a big
bite before reeling him in.

The first to make
a move always wins.

[ICHIYOU]
The vehicle detonation signal

106
00:08:32,733 --> 00:08:35,358
came from Area C-33.

107
00:08:39,025 --> 00:08:40,608
A pool of blood?

108
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:42,650
[MASKED MAN]
Death.

109

The slumber of death
for the gifted.

[AKUTAGAWA] I'm surprised

Are you the one

[MASKED MAN] For the
resurrection of my beloved,

I must carry out this

Killing for the sake
of another person.

Is that why you are here?

[AKUTAGAWA]
You said this was for

162
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:05,733
the resurrection
of your beloved.

163
00:12:05,817 --> 00:12:10,150
So you're doing this for
that woman, aren't you?

164
00:12:10,233 --> 00:12:12,233
I remember that battle well.

165
00:12:12,317 --> 00:12:15,608
I defeated her when I
attacked you at the port.

166
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:18,317
[HAWTHORNE]
You defeated her?

167
00:12:19,525 --> 00:12:22,358
What's your name? Who are you?

168
00:12:41,775 --> 00:12:43,567
My hat is missing.

169
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:46,150
[OSAMU]
Is this what you're looking for?

170
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:49,025
Hey there, demon Fyodor.

171
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:50,650
[FYODOR D.]
You again.

172
00:12:50,733 --> 00:12:54,900
The last time I saw you would've
been at the Mukurotoride.

173
00:12:54,983 --> 00:12:56,108
[OSAMU]
A double-pronged attack

174
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:59,067
using the masked man
as bait this time.

175
00:12:59,150 --> 00:13:02,942
I wouldn't expect anything
less from you, Fyodor.

176
00:13:04,692 --> 00:13:06,817
So I figured out
your escape route,

177
00:13:06,900 --> 00:13:09,275
and I just waited
for you to arrive.

178
00:13:09,358 --> 00:13:10,233
How do I look?

179
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:11,733
[FYODOR D.]
Terrible.

180
00:13:11,817 --> 00:13:14,900
Oh, fine. Have it back, then.

181
00:13:17,317 --> 00:13:20,358
[OSAMU] This has your
name written all over it.

182
00:13:20,442 --> 00:13:22,192
Tinkering with a
poor priest's head

183
00:13:22,275 --> 00:13:24,067
to turn him into an assassin,

184
00:13:24,150 --> 00:13:27,942
and then having him attack the
leaders of two organizations.

185
00:13:28,025 --> 00:13:30,858
[FYODOR D.] What do you
intend to do about it?

186
00:13:30,942 --> 00:13:35,567
I intend to have you tell me
what poison you used on my boss.

187
00:13:36,775 --> 00:13:39,400
[OSAMU] I know what
your ultimate goal is.

188
00:13:39,483 --> 00:13:42,067
In order to obtain
the book you need,

189
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,192
you plan to purge Yokohama
of all its gifted.

190
00:13:46,275 --> 00:13:48,108
But you Rats don't
have the manpower

191
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:51,067
to burn it down the way
the Guild almost did.

192
00:13:51,150 --> 00:13:53,400
That's why you tried to
assassinate the heads

193
00:13:53,483 --> 00:13:56,775
of the Detective Agency
and the Port Mafia.

194
00:13:56,858 --> 00:13:59,400
[FYODOR D.]
Why do you think that?

195
00:13:59,483 --> 00:14:02,150
Because that's what
I would do in your shoes.

196
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:07,275
So we're two-of-a-kind.
Is that what you're saying?

197
00:14:07,358 --> 00:14:11,233
Very well. I'll tell you
what you wish to know.

198
00:14:11,317 --> 00:14:15,442
The poison I used...
is a cannibalizing ability.

00:14:15,525 --> 00:14:16,567
[OSAMU gasps]

200
00:14:21,483 --> 00:14:24,567
This thing... What is it?

201
00:14:24,650 --> 00:14:28,233
[FYODOR D.] It's a viral ability
belonging to a certain criminal.

202
00:14:28,317 --> 00:14:30,650
A microscopic
supernatural life form

203
00:14:30,733 --> 00:14:33,650
that will grow to
maturity in 48 hours,

204
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:37,358
during which time it eats
through the bodies of two hosts.

205
00:14:37,442 --> 00:14:39,650
However, if one of
the hosts expires

206
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:43,858
during this process,
the activity stops.

207
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:46,400
In other words,
to save the president,

208
00:14:46,483 --> 00:14:48,733
the only option is to
kill the other host,

209
00:14:48,817 --> 00:14:50,442
which happens to be Mori.

210
00:14:50,525 --> 00:14:53,858
[FYODOR D.] Your nullification
ability is of no use here.

211
00:14:53,942 --> 00:14:57,275
The virus will be hidden amongst
the hosts' vital organs.

212
00:14:57,358 --> 00:15:00,692
Even for you, touching
it would be suicidal.

[chuckles]

214
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,942
What will you do?

215
00:15:04,025 --> 00:15:07,150
Will you discuss it
with the Port Mafia?

216

[CHUUYA]
Son of a bitch!

Just two days?!

Armed Detective Agency

and Port Mafia
against each other.

220
00:15:15,108 --> 00:15:16,400
So what?

00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:19,150
Are you're really
planning to fight them?

222
00:15:19,233 --> 00:15:21,608
Because that's exactly what
the mastermind wants.

223
00:15:21,692 --> 00:15:24,108
I'd rather beat
the shit outta him.

Thing is...

...two days isn't
nearly enough time.

226

[FYODOR D.]
People are sinful and foolish.

227

Even knowing full well
that they're being tricked

228
00:15:35,650 --> 00:15:37,775
and manipulated into doing so,

229
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:42,192
humans can't help but engage in
the act of killing each other.

230

I seek the book in order to
cleanse them of this sin.

231
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:47,817
This is how it starts.

He knew my movements
down to a T.

[FYODOR D.] I told him
not to aim for your vitals.

with the Port Mafia.

[OSAMU] You said
we were two-of-a-kind.

It's true we're cut
from the same cloth,

but when it comes
to how we think...

241
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:35,775
...there's just one
little difference.

242

[OSAMU] You're right about
people being sinful and foolish.

Yet you still came, willing to
obtain knowledge at all costs.

The book you're looking for
is a self-contained novel.

Whatever is written
in it becomes reality.

This is what I found:

It looks like the Mafia's
warning was accurate.

The ability is draining
the life out of him.

I'm not certain whether he'll
regain consciousness or not.

[DOPPO]
What indeed.

00:20:58,233 --> 00:21:01,442
[CHUUYA]
Hmm. It's that brat again.

316
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:12,608
[CHUUYA] Physical attacks
do almost nothing to him.

317
00:21:12,692 --> 00:21:15,650
They're playing their
trump card right off the bat.

318
00:21:15,733 --> 00:21:19,317
They're probably trying to
buy time to get their boss out.

319
00:21:21,692 --> 00:21:24,150
[ICHIYOU]
Sir, it's not just the child.

320
00:21:24,233 --> 00:21:26,483
It's also Kunikida,
the weretiger.

321
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,983
[gasps]

322
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:29,775
[ICHIYOU] Almost the entirety
of the Agency's main force

323
00:21:29,858 --> 00:21:32,067
is defending the room.

324
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:35,442
That's nuts. Going
full-force already?

325
00:21:42,942 --> 00:21:45,150
[CHUUYA]
We'll respond with our top men.

326
00:21:45,233 --> 00:21:48,608
Get Akutagawa and the
Black Lizard here right now!

327
00:22:05,275 --> 00:22:08,025
[CHUUYA]
Wanna do this one by one?

328
00:22:09,483 --> 00:22:12,817
Or should we all
go at it at once?

329
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:15,108
Well?

330
00:22:15,192 --> 00:22:17,358
Doesn't matter to me.

331
00:23:51,817 --> 00:23:53,233
[RAMPO]
That's right...

332
00:23:53,317 --> 00:23:55,150
If we were to fight
the Mafia head-on,

333
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:57,525
people would surely die.

334
00:23:57,608 --> 00:24:02,275
The only way to avoid that is to
find the creator of the virus.

335
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:03,692
[ATSUSHI] But what if
that ability user

336
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:04,858
has already left town?

337
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,942
[RAMPO]
I can assure you they haven't.

338
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:11,150
[RAMPO]
They're still in Yokohama.

339
00:24:11,233 --> 00:24:14,775
Next time on
<i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> , Episode 34:

340
00:24:14,858 --> 00:24:17,400
"Cannibalism, Part 1."

341
00:24:17,483 --> 00:24:20,108
Hurry, the president's
life is in danger!
