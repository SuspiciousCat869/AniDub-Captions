They burn the remains
of the deceased

All you've lost is money.
And status. That's all.

Wasn't there

Lemme see...

Miss Louisa usually drank
coffee before work.

55
00:04:25,275 --> 00:04:29,108
Louisa. She was a strategist
for the Guild, wasn't she?

56
00:04:29,192 --> 00:04:30,775
She was sweet.

57
00:04:30,858 --> 00:04:32,858
She was the scout who
originally discovered me

58
00:04:32,942 --> 00:04:34,983
when I was at the orphanage.

59

B-Besides she was
never my friend.

I mean...

65
00:04:49,358 --> 00:04:52,608
Miss Louisa was basically
as shy as clam.

66
00:04:52,692 --> 00:04:56,192
I never saw her have a normal
conversation with anyone.

67
00:04:56,275 --> 00:05:00,275
Oh. Except with the
boss, Lord Francis.

68
00:05:00,358 --> 00:05:02,900
That man had no interest in
what anybody else thought,

69
00:05:02,983 --> 00:05:05,733
which probably made
it easier for her.

00:05:05,817 --> 00:05:07,358
Oh, I see.

71
00:05:07,442 --> 00:05:09,442
And she honestly admired him.

72
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:11,150
I don't think it ever
occurred to Louisa

73
00:05:11,233 --> 00:05:14,025
to use her ability for
something she wanted.

74
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:16,817
She only used it when
she was ordered to?

I wondered as well.

77
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:22,442
It might be because...

00:05:22,525 --> 00:05:26,067
...she didn't really care all
that much about herself.

somewhere in this city,

163
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,983
so I can save my
wife from herself.

164
00:09:52,067 --> 00:09:54,192
[ALCOTT]
Then let's do it! Again...

165
00:09:54,275 --> 00:09:56,483
[FITZGERALD] But to find the
book and break the seal,

166
00:09:56,567 --> 00:10:00,233
I'm going to need a large-scale
special ability investigation.

167
00:10:00,317 --> 00:10:03,650
The Gifted Special Operations
Division will be key.

168
00:10:03,733 --> 00:10:05,233
[ALCOTT]
Right.

169
00:10:05,317 --> 00:10:07,358
So we should buy off
their operatives.

170
00:10:07,442 --> 00:10:09,150
[FITZGERALD]
That would be a weak solution.

171
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,650
[gasps]

172
00:10:10,733 --> 00:10:13,650
The way I see it, we might as
well buy the whole thing.

173
00:10:13,733 --> 00:10:16,692
You made an estimate a
while back, didn't you?

174
00:10:16,775 --> 00:10:18,650
As I recall, the amount
needed to buy

175
00:10:18,733 --> 00:10:20,192
the Special Operations Division

176
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:22,817
and the Ministry of the
Interior, which controls it,

177
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:25,692
was approximately
50 billion dollars.

178
00:10:25,775 --> 00:10:27,275
We have no capital.

179
00:10:27,358 --> 00:10:31,525
All we have are two gifted whose
names are on the wanted list.

180
00:10:31,608 --> 00:10:34,608
And doesn't that
make it more exciting?

181
00:10:34,692 --> 00:10:35,858
Yes!

182
00:10:37,275 --> 00:10:40,483
[FITZGERALD] This is the
birth of the new Guild.

183
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:47,317
Beasts of sin that are
clamoring for a miracle.

184
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:51,150
Crimes that have been repeated
for thousands of years.

185
00:10:57,400 --> 00:11:01,525
[FYODOR D.] Do not worry.
It is almost complete.

186
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:14,567
This building will serve as
headquarters for the new Guild.

187
00:11:17,233 --> 00:11:18,650
[ALCOTT]
I'm going to use my ability

188
00:11:18,733 --> 00:11:21,525
to come up with a
brand-new strategy.

189
00:11:21,608 --> 00:11:23,692
[FITZGERALD] You mean your
ability to predict and handle

190
00:11:23,775 --> 00:11:25,400
the prospects of
all developments

191
00:11:25,483 --> 00:11:27,858
during an operation?

192
00:11:27,942 --> 00:11:30,483
You're one of the top gifted
in the Guild, Miss Louisa,

193
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,817
yet 50 billion dollars
would be wasted on you.

194
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:37,233
It's worth no more than loose
change found on the street.

195
00:11:37,317 --> 00:11:38,900
I need a private room.

196
00:11:38,983 --> 00:11:41,942
I have to be by myself
to activate my ability.

197
00:11:42,025 --> 00:11:44,858
Give me about three
minutes please.

198
00:11:44,942 --> 00:11:46,483
[FITZGERALD]
All right.

199
00:11:46,567 --> 00:11:48,275
[TV HOST]
This year we have...

200
00:11:48,358 --> 00:11:49,358
[FITZGERALD]
Uhh...

201
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:51,775
Oh, no. This must
be our neighbors'!

202
00:11:53,983 --> 00:11:56,192
I thought our headquarters
was this whole building.

203
00:11:56,275 --> 00:11:57,858
All we have is one room?

204
00:11:57,942 --> 00:11:59,275
I guess.

205
00:11:59,358 --> 00:12:00,567
[FITZGERALD]
Fine.

206
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:01,442
[ALCOTT gasps]

207
00:12:01,525 --> 00:12:03,108
[FITZGERALD]
Excuse me.

208
00:12:05,358 --> 00:12:06,567
[gasps]

209
00:12:06,650 --> 00:12:12,442
[FITZGERALD laughing]

210
00:12:17,025 --> 00:12:21,192
Now then, three minutes will
be worth about two weeks.

211
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:33,983
[ALCOTT] My ability
doesn't really allow me

212
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:35,358
to predict the future

213
00:12:35,442 --> 00:12:38,900
based on existing information
that I already have.

214
00:12:38,983 --> 00:12:42,108
It slows the flow of time
to one eight-thousandth,

215
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:46,483
but only when I'm spending time
thinking in a locked room alone.

216
00:12:52,692 --> 00:12:57,233
[ECKLEBERG] Well, this'll be the
second to last drink of my life.

217
00:13:03,025 --> 00:13:06,400
My friend, I'll be
with you very soon.

218
00:13:06,483 --> 00:13:07,942
[FITZGERALD]
That's it?

219
00:13:08,025 --> 00:13:11,067
The last drink of your life is
going to be that degreaser?

220
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:12,317
[ECKLEBERG]
Who're you?!

221
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:15,650
Don't mind me.
I'm just here to watch.

222
00:13:15,733 --> 00:13:18,817
Seeing people kill themselves
with guns is boring,

223
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:21,400
but watching you off yourself
with metal degreaser

224
00:13:21,483 --> 00:13:23,775
will be a spectacle.

225
00:13:23,858 --> 00:13:28,525
Professor T.J. Eckleberg.
An engineer for a security firm.

226
00:13:28,608 --> 00:13:31,400
A genius that almost
single-handedly developed

227
00:13:31,483 --> 00:13:35,858
a facial recognition system
for security cameras.

228
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:38,233
And a murderer who killed
his own colleague.

229
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:40,775
[ECKLEBERG]
I didn't do it!

230
00:13:40,858 --> 00:13:43,192
At least, I don't think I did.

231
00:13:43,275 --> 00:13:44,775
Nine days ago,

232
00:13:44,858 --> 00:13:48,108
one of your fellow engineers was
killed while he was at work.

233
00:13:48,192 --> 00:13:50,483
Ironically, what led
to your arrest

234
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,983
was the image from the
facial recognition system

235
00:13:53,067 --> 00:13:54,858
that you had created.

236
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,150
[ECKLEBERG] That day,
I had gotten into a fight

237
00:13:57,233 --> 00:13:59,775
with my co-worker,
my best friend,

238
00:13:59,858 --> 00:14:02,192
and then drank so much
I blacked out.

239
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:05,358
When I came to, I was in front
of the company offices.

240
00:14:05,442 --> 00:14:07,983
My clothes were soaked
with my friend's blood.

241
00:14:08,067 --> 00:14:10,025
But I swear I didn't do it.

242
00:14:10,108 --> 00:14:11,483
Please believe me!

243
00:14:11,567 --> 00:14:12,775
[chuckles]

244
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:17,358
I don't really care if you were
the one who killed him or not.

245
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,483
I can make you appear innocent.

246
00:14:20,567 --> 00:14:23,692
Wh-What is it you
want with me?

247
00:14:23,775 --> 00:14:27,025
I want the source code to your
facial recognition system.

248
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,233
I'm interested in
buying Eyes of God.

249
00:14:29,317 --> 00:14:30,567
[gasps]

250
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:33,525
[FITZGERALD] I'll give you
200,000 for the patent.

251
00:14:33,608 --> 00:14:35,317
That's worth as much
as a pebble to me

252
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,900
when compared to what
I'm looking for.

253
00:14:37,983 --> 00:14:40,650
But it's a good
first step anyway.

254
00:14:40,733 --> 00:14:44,567
So the choice is yours,
genius engineer.

255
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,942
Is it me? Or the degreaser?

256
00:14:48,025 --> 00:14:50,650
Which poison will you choose?

257
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:58,317
[gasps]

258
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,942
[ALCOTT]
Lord Francis!

259
00:15:00,025 --> 00:15:01,317
[chuckles]

260
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:03,858
As requested, I've arranged
an appointment

261
00:15:03,942 --> 00:15:07,025
with the security firm that
the professor worked for.

262
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:11,567
Um... what's with the bags?
What is all that?

263
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:15,150
I just bought this.
It's amazing, Miss Louisa!

264
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,983
[ALCOTT] Why did you get
three of the same pot?

265
00:15:19,067 --> 00:15:21,233
[FITZGERALD] Because it
was on sale today only!

266
00:15:21,317 --> 00:15:23,108
"Buy one, get two free!"

267
00:15:23,192 --> 00:15:24,025
Uh?

268
00:15:24,108 --> 00:15:25,317
It's eye-opening.

269
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,358
Shopping only for
afford able goods

270
00:15:27,442 --> 00:15:29,900
and living on an extremely
limited budget...

271
00:15:29,983 --> 00:15:31,817
...can be highly entertaining!

272
00:15:31,900 --> 00:15:35,817
Up until today, I always bought
the entire store. And it's...

273
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:38,608
[ALCOTT] Oh, dear. He's
been so rich for so long.

274
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:42,108
Of course he has absolutely
no idea how to shop.

275
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,150
He doesn't even know the
first thing about cooking!

276
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:47,858
I'll have to return
everything later.

277
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:02,442
Lukewarm tea?
Your company has no dignity.

278
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,192
[BUCHANAN] What is it that
brings you here today?

279
00:16:05,275 --> 00:16:06,400
[FITZGERALD]
I can clear the name

280
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,733
of your former employee,
Professor Eckleberg.

281
00:16:09,817 --> 00:16:13,442
Pay me 100,000 dollars
upon my success.

282
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:15,150
You can clear his name?

283
00:16:15,233 --> 00:16:17,483
It can't be good for
your company's PR.

284
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,692
Your former employee
is a murderer.

285
00:16:20,775 --> 00:16:22,650
[BUCHANAN]
No thank you.

286
00:16:22,733 --> 00:16:25,400
If the facial recognition
system, Eyes of God,

287
00:16:25,483 --> 00:16:26,942
came to that conclusion,

288
00:16:27,025 --> 00:16:30,317
then there can be no doubt
that the professor is guilty.

289
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,067
Why would a corporation
want to save

290
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,233
someone like him anyway?

291
00:16:34,317 --> 00:16:37,400
You treat a down-and-out
employee like he's biohazard.

292
00:16:37,483 --> 00:16:39,483
[chuckles]

293
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,192
[FITZGERALD]
Disgusting. I'm leaving.

294
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,775
[FITZGERALD] Dig through
the dirt on that murder.

295
00:16:50,858 --> 00:16:53,483
It's obvious the chairman
knows something.

296
00:16:53,567 --> 00:16:56,275
[ALCOTT]
But I'm only a strategist.

297
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,942
I don't have the ability
to solve a mystery.

298
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,608
My employees are
all highly capable.

299
00:17:01,692 --> 00:17:03,650
You may not be able
to solve the crime,

300
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:05,942
but you certainly know
someone who can.

301
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:07,317
[gasps]

302
00:17:08,317 --> 00:17:09,775
Right?

303
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,900
Hey, Rampo, are you in there?

304
00:17:16,983 --> 00:17:18,192
[BOTH]
Huh?

305
00:17:18,275 --> 00:17:20,400
Oh. It's one of the
guys from the Guild.

306
00:17:20,483 --> 00:17:23,442
[RAMPO] Hey, Poe!
It's so nice to see you!

307
00:17:23,525 --> 00:17:26,067
How's your new mystery novel
comin' along, huh?!

308
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:27,942
Actually, I've only
come here today

309
00:17:28,025 --> 00:17:29,358
to challenge you with a riddle.

310
00:17:29,442 --> 00:17:31,942
So those aren't pages
from your new story?

311
00:17:32,025 --> 00:17:34,442
[POE]
These are other documents.

312
00:17:34,525 --> 00:17:36,608
A former security firm engineer

313
00:17:36,692 --> 00:17:39,942
was recently suspected of
murdering his coworker.

314
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,567
The guy from Manhasset Security?

315
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:44,192
[RAMPO]
Mm...

316
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,650
This is an interesting
case indeed.

317
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:49,192
But the professor
isn't the murderer.

318
00:17:51,192 --> 00:17:52,942
The chairman did it.

319
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,150
[PROSECUTOR]
Given the evidence presented,

320
00:17:56,233 --> 00:17:59,442
we believe that the defendant,
although heavily intoxicated,

321
00:17:59,525 --> 00:18:02,525
is responsible for this
very violent murder.

322
00:18:02,608 --> 00:18:05,317
Thus there are no
grounds for clemency.

323
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,983
[JUDGE] We will now
recess for 15 minutes

324
00:18:09,067 --> 00:18:11,525
while the jury makes
their decision.

325
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:18,817
[FITZGERALD]
So far so good, murderer.

326
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,733
You killed your own employee,

327
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:23,858
and successfully blamed
it on someone else.

328
00:18:23,942 --> 00:18:27,358
I commend you for having
sullied your own hands.

329
00:18:27,442 --> 00:18:30,192
The first secret to
success is this:

330
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,192
If you want something
done right,

331
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,317
then you have to do it yourself.

332
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:35,858
Wouldn't you agree?

333
00:18:35,942 --> 00:18:37,483
[BUCHANAN]
What're you talking about?

334
00:18:37,567 --> 00:18:41,525
Your little scheme was quite
obvious to our detective.

335
00:18:41,608 --> 00:18:43,442
Unbeknowst to the professor,

336
00:18:43,525 --> 00:18:46,858
you had a backdoor secret
code planted in the system.

337
00:18:46,942 --> 00:18:50,108
It was automatically set
to replace your face

338
00:18:50,192 --> 00:18:52,108
with the footage
of someone else's.

339
00:18:52,192 --> 00:18:55,400
I'm sure that both government
and criminal organizations

340
00:18:55,483 --> 00:18:58,275
would spend a lot of
money for that code.

341
00:18:58,358 --> 00:19:00,650
After you covertly had
the professor's colleague

342
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:02,358
write the backdoor code,

343
00:19:02,442 --> 00:19:04,900
you killed him to
secure his silence.

344
00:19:04,983 --> 00:19:08,317
Then you replaced your image
with that of the professor,

345
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,858
and pinned the crime on him.

346
00:19:13,692 --> 00:19:15,150
Are you threatening me?

347
00:19:15,233 --> 00:19:17,525
[FITZGERALD]
Give me 400,000 dollars.

348
00:19:17,608 --> 00:19:18,775
I'll forget we ever spoke

349
00:19:18,858 --> 00:19:22,317
and make sure the professor
is found guilty.

350
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,567
The truth isn't even worth
a penny, for goodness sake.

351
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,775
But your own profit...
now that's priceless.

352
00:19:28,858 --> 00:19:31,608
[chuckles] You're
absolutely right.

353
00:19:31,692 --> 00:19:34,692
Look at those eyes.
I know what you're like.

354
00:19:34,775 --> 00:19:38,400
You think people's lives are
about as worthless as trash.

355
00:19:38,483 --> 00:19:40,942
Your eyes are similar to mine.

356
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:42,108
[BUCHANAN chuckles]

357
00:19:42,192 --> 00:19:44,025
Very well then.

Here's the check for 400,000.

359
00:19:47,483 --> 00:19:49,858
This should help you forget
I committed that murder,

360
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,442
and forget all about
that backdoor code.

I'll help you cover up
whatever you want.

363

This is why it's so hard
to stop being a villain.

364

Exactly.

Please believe me.
I'm not the one who did it.

366
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:10,317
So have you come to a verdict?

367
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,858
[JUROR]
Yes, Your Honor.

368
00:20:11,942 --> 00:20:15,983
It was a unanimous decision.
We find the defendant guilty.

Here's the check for 400,000.

00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:38,233
This should help you forget
I committed that murder,

and forget all about

It's a bogus device!

have any value in court.

of justice?!

me the guilty one.

kinds of rumors soon enough.

The head of a big corporation

behind a murder.

And since I knew
this was coming,
