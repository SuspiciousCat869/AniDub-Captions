If we were to fight

According to Dazai, the gifted

The hideout of the

But didn't you say he's
from another country?

He was born abroad,

00:12:22,233 --> 00:12:26,108
[DOPPO crying]

164
00:12:26,192 --> 00:12:30,817
[DOPPO yells]

165
00:12:33,608 --> 00:12:35,442
[ATSUSHI]
A skinny Russian?

166
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,608
That's right.

167
00:12:36,692 --> 00:12:39,025
He told me if my life
was ever in danger

168
00:12:39,108 --> 00:12:42,192
to show this to my pursuers.

169
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,858
He was a good man.

170
00:12:45,775 --> 00:12:47,525
A report...

171
00:12:47,608 --> 00:12:51,275
...from the military on the
gifted who controls the virus.

172
00:12:52,192 --> 00:12:54,067
[ATSUSHI]
It's not him.

173
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:57,150
It sure looks authentic,
but is it really?

174
00:12:59,108 --> 00:13:00,650
What do you think?

175
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,108
The document certainly
looks very official,

176
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:05,567
but I'm sure it's nothing
more than a fake.

177
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,108
[ATSUSHI] So the enemy's
even trying to use

178
00:13:07,192 --> 00:13:09,858
your deductive
skills against us?

179
00:13:09,942 --> 00:13:12,900
[RAMPO] I've decided I really
don't like this enemy.

180
00:13:12,983 --> 00:13:15,150
It's like going up
against Dazai.

181
00:13:15,233 --> 00:13:16,942
[YOUNG MAN]
By the way...

182
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:20,983
The Russian gave me a
message to pass on to you.

183
00:13:21,067 --> 00:13:23,733
This is what he said,
word for word:

184
00:13:25,358 --> 00:13:29,317
Do not waste your energy
trying to "change the rules."

185
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,942
Unfortunately, we don't
have any more chips to use

186
00:13:33,025 --> 00:13:35,358
as leverage with the Port Mafia.

187
00:13:41,192 --> 00:13:43,692
[RAMPO]
Junichirou's in danger.

188
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,150
[HIROTSU] It's been years
since the Port Mafia

189
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:03,817
has had to be this vicious.

190
00:14:05,025 --> 00:14:08,233
[HIROTSU]
The promised time has come.

191
00:14:08,317 --> 00:14:12,150
It appears the Agency has failed
to capture the virus user.

192
00:14:12,233 --> 00:14:14,942
They've avoided contacting us
because Rampo felt that was

193
00:14:15,025 --> 00:14:16,483
the best course of action.

194
00:14:16,567 --> 00:14:18,108
It doesn't mean anything.

195
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:21,900
Unfortunately, hostilities
can no longer be avoided.

196
00:14:21,983 --> 00:14:24,983
I'd prepare for the
worst if I were you.

197
00:14:25,067 --> 00:14:28,150
We once battled when a
bounty of seven billion yen

198
00:14:28,233 --> 00:14:30,150
was placed on one
of your members.

199
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:33,400
Our agencies also fought during
the subsequent three-way war

200
00:14:33,483 --> 00:14:34,942
with the Guild.

201
00:14:35,025 --> 00:14:38,692
But now the Port Mafia fights
for more than mere profit.

202
00:14:38,775 --> 00:14:40,983
We fight to protect our boss.

203
00:14:41,067 --> 00:14:44,567
We fight for our organization's
very existence.

204
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:46,817
Most of us wouldn't
even think twice about

205
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:49,567
giving their lives
for such a cause.

206
00:14:49,650 --> 00:14:52,858
I'm certainly no different.

207
00:14:52,942 --> 00:14:55,817
The only path open to
us is soaked with blood

208
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:58,483
and littered with
human entrails.

209
00:14:58,567 --> 00:15:02,400
It's a path the Mafia is
accustomed to traveling.

210
00:15:02,483 --> 00:15:04,733
Are you gonna kill me, then?

211
00:15:04,817 --> 00:15:07,442
No, I'll have you
become a double agent.

212
00:15:07,525 --> 00:15:09,858
[JUNICHIROU] You want me
to spy on the Agency?

213
00:15:09,942 --> 00:15:11,275
There's no way you're
gonna get me to--

214
00:15:11,358 --> 00:15:14,525
You have a younger
sister, do you not?

215
00:15:15,942 --> 00:15:19,233
[HIROTSU]
Gin here is a trained assassin.

216
00:15:20,567 --> 00:15:22,775
If you fail to comply
with our demands,

217
00:15:22,858 --> 00:15:24,150
her fate will be--

218
00:15:24,233 --> 00:15:27,650
[JUNICHIROU] If you do
anything to Naomi, I swear...

219
00:15:27,733 --> 00:15:29,650
...I'll kill you all!

220
00:15:34,442 --> 00:15:37,275
I like that fire in your eyes.

221
00:15:38,858 --> 00:15:41,067
You thugs could shoot
off a million bullets

222
00:15:41,150 --> 00:15:42,608
and they would all miss me.

223
00:15:42,692 --> 00:15:45,775
You wanna put that to the test?

224
00:15:45,858 --> 00:15:48,025
Try it if you dare.

225
00:15:54,775 --> 00:15:56,692
Ability: Doppo Poet!

226
00:15:56,775 --> 00:15:58,900
Tatami Gatana!

227

More of your
illusion ability, huh.

228
00:16:15,025 --> 00:16:17,067
"Light Snow," was it?

229
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:20,108
That's enough, Michizou.

230
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:22,067
You won't be able to hit him.

231
00:16:22,150 --> 00:16:24,067
Where the hell did
that knife come from?

232
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,900
I thought we searched the guy.

233
00:16:25,983 --> 00:16:28,900
The Agency's gifted have
more cards up their sleeve

234
00:16:28,983 --> 00:16:30,942
than we had expected.

235
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:39,192
Watch out!

236
00:16:44,192 --> 00:16:45,983
You get the bastard?

237
00:16:46,067 --> 00:16:47,692
Seems not.

238
00:16:48,567 --> 00:16:50,733
[MICHIZOU]
That was an illusion, too!

Dammit.

240
00:17:00,483 --> 00:17:03,483
[MICHIZOU sighs]
Looks like we're locked in.

241
00:17:03,567 --> 00:17:05,817
[HIROTSU] I would have
never expected so much

242
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:08,983
from an illusion-using gifted.

243
00:17:09,067 --> 00:17:11,442
That boy is far too dangerous.

244
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:13,983
For a member of
the Agency, his ability is

245
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:16,650
terrifyingly suited
for assassination.

246
00:17:16,733 --> 00:17:18,567
So now what, old man?

247
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:21,983
It appears his objective wasn't
to stay behind to negotiate

248
00:17:22,067 --> 00:17:23,650
with the Port Mafia.

249
00:17:23,733 --> 00:17:25,525
Huh?

250
00:17:25,608 --> 00:17:28,233
He has another goal in mind.

251
00:17:29,775 --> 00:17:33,025
[HIROTSU]
To assassinate the boss.

252
00:17:33,108 --> 00:17:34,608

There's been an enemy intrusion.

one way to end this war...

You shouldn't move

Where am I?

[LUCY] This is Anne's Room.
The safest place in the world.

yours came crying to me,

I say about not moving?

267
00:18:32,775 --> 00:18:36,233

Huh?

00:18:37,233 --> 00:18:39,650
My life's not as important.

270
00:18:39,733 --> 00:18:42,442
To save this city from ruin,

00:18:42,525 --> 00:18:45,275
they need to be told.

272
00:18:58,858 --> 00:19:00,858
Forgive me, young man.

273
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:03,150
If that man were
to suddenly die,

274
00:19:03,233 --> 00:19:06,233
the Port Mafia would regress
to its previous form.

275
00:19:06,317 --> 00:19:08,858
A form that I despise.

276

[KOUYOU] You can make
yourself appear to vanish.

[ATSUSHI gasps]

298
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:05,192
The plan succeeded.

Kyouka managed to
escape with Junichirou.

Rampo... I'm sorry...

303
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:35,733
I seriously messed up.

[RAMPO]
It's all right.

What's going on with
the Port Mafia, Kenji?

306

From what I can tell, it looks
like they've moved their boss

to an underground shelter.

That's one place
we can't sneak into.

No, we're just going to

Just a second, Rampo.

The message I just received--

313
00:21:54,733 --> 00:21:58,275
it said the boss doesn't want
us fighting the Port Mafia.

Tell me...

much time to mull it over.

[ATSUSHI] We can't get into
a fight with the Port Mafia.
