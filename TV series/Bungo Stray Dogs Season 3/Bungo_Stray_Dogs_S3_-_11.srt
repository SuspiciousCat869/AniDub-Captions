[YUKICHI] As vile

[OUGAI]
Now, my dear Elise,

3
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,192
make sure that he
gets his shots.

4
00:00:35,525 --> 00:00:37,233
[OUGAI]
He draws the sword so deftly

5
00:00:37,317 --> 00:00:38,900
that you don't even see it.

6
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:41,817
I'd expect no less
of the Silver Wolf,

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:45,108
once the government's best
sword-wielding assassin.

[OUGAI]
Yes.

I've been told that you are
an exceptional bodyguard.

12
00:02:43,192 --> 00:02:45,900
[YUKICHI] I'm busy preparing
to open a detective agency,

13
00:02:45,983 --> 00:02:48,858
so I'm abstaining from
that work for now.

14
00:02:48,942 --> 00:02:52,858
I'm only making an exception
by order of Master Natsume.

15
00:02:52,942 --> 00:02:55,025
You're taking a break?

16
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:58,150
It would be a real shame
if your skills got rusty.

[YUKICHI grunts]

Doctor! Our man's
down! Please help us!

19
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:06,108
Very well. But don't
start a fight here.

20
00:03:06,192 --> 00:03:08,525
I'm also treating
the one who shot him.

[MAN A]
Understood.

[OUGAI]
Oh, you can relax.

23
00:03:13,358 --> 00:03:16,233
This clinic is considered
a neutral zone.

00:03:16,317 --> 00:03:18,483
There's never a
dull moment here.

25
00:03:18,567 --> 00:03:22,650
I hear all kinds of stories
from the underground.

26
00:03:22,733 --> 00:03:25,400
[YUKICHI]
Underground Doctor Mori.

27
00:03:25,483 --> 00:03:27,983
What a shady character.

28
00:03:28,067 --> 00:03:29,317
Why would Master Natsume

29
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:32,067
possibly order me
to protect him?

[MAN B]
Doctor Mori.

31
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,442
Because your little
clinic's in a safe zone,

32
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,442
you must pick up a
lot of information

33
00:03:50,525 --> 00:03:52,900
from your criminal clientele.

34
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:57,025
Enough to shut down a smaller
organization overnight.

I know your side job. Trading
info on the black market.

36
00:04:02,108 --> 00:04:04,817
Me and my boys wanna know
where the Port Mafia

37
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:07,400
is hiding their weapons stash.

00:04:09,817 --> 00:04:12,400
[MAN B] Their boss has been
goin' on a rampage lately

and knockin' people off.

40
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:17,442
So we've come up with a plan.

41
00:04:17,525 --> 00:04:19,733
We use their weapons
for our crimes

42
00:04:19,817 --> 00:04:21,733
and turn the Port Mafia
into our scapegoat.

43
00:04:21,817 --> 00:04:23,900
[OUGAI]
I already know that.

44
00:04:23,983 --> 00:04:27,650
You attacked a medical
transport truck last week.

45
00:04:27,733 --> 00:04:30,692
You see, I love everything
about this city.

00:04:30,775 --> 00:04:34,025
I even love its dark side.

47
00:04:34,108 --> 00:04:37,567
But parasites like you
make me sick to my stomach.

Don't be like that.

[YUKICHI] You were just buying
time for me to arrive, right?

58
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:07,150
[chuckles]

59
00:05:07,233 --> 00:05:11,358
We have the same stench--
the disgusting stench of death.

60
00:05:20,942 --> 00:05:22,525
[OUGAI]
I pretended to be caught

61
00:05:22,608 --> 00:05:25,650
so they would reveal
where their hideout was.

62
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,858
It's time to deliver
a little payback.

63
00:05:28,942 --> 00:05:32,400
Just as Master
Natsume planned it.

64
00:05:32,483 --> 00:05:34,733
Master Natsume?

65
00:05:36,275 --> 00:05:37,983
[OSAMU]
Yes, Natsume.

66
00:05:38,067 --> 00:05:40,442
The legendary gifted
who was instrumental

67
00:05:40,525 --> 00:05:43,358
in founding the
Armed Detective Agency.

68
00:05:43,442 --> 00:05:46,275
His whereabouts are
a mystery to everyone.

69
00:05:46,358 --> 00:05:49,150
Rumor has it,
his ability is unrivaled,

70
00:05:49,233 --> 00:05:51,692
allowing him to see
through anything.

71
00:05:55,817 --> 00:05:58,442
Uh... Sardines?

72
00:06:02,442 --> 00:06:05,858
[YUKICHI] Didn't you tell me
I could handle this on my own?

73
00:06:05,942 --> 00:06:07,275
There were far more enemies

74
00:06:07,358 --> 00:06:10,525
than your information
suggested, Mori.

75
00:06:10,608 --> 00:06:14,317
But what a treat to witness the
Silver Fox's talent up close.

76
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,525
And I only had to handle
half of them by myself.

77
00:06:18,608 --> 00:06:20,608
Was it not in vain?

78
00:06:20,692 --> 00:06:22,233
How do you mean?

79
00:06:22,317 --> 00:06:23,942
[YUKICHI]
This conspiracy was no more

80
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:27,858
than a grain among
the sands of calamity.

81
00:06:27,942 --> 00:06:31,192
Until the tyranny of the
Port Mafia is done away with,

82
00:06:31,275 --> 00:06:33,692
disasters will
continue to strike.

83
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:35,608
I'm aware of that.

84
00:06:35,692 --> 00:06:38,025
It's for that reason
I'll be taking on

85
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:40,900
Master Natsume's
three-party framework.

86
00:06:42,525 --> 00:06:44,858
[YUKICHI]
Three-party framework?

[OUGAI yells]

88
00:06:52,733 --> 00:06:55,817
[OUGAI] Ever since we
battled here 12 years ago,

89
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,817
the two of us have fought and
clashed time and time again.

90
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,692
But when we fought
alongside one another,

91
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:05,983
we were invariably unmatched.

92
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,192

Rintarou... I'm sorry.

94
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,858
I'll be waiting for you
on the other side.

95
00:07:29,817 --> 00:07:32,650
I expected that
this would happen.

96
00:07:35,192 --> 00:07:39,400
[YUKICHI] This is the end of
the three-party framework.

97
00:07:39,483 --> 00:07:42,483
[OUGAI]
Master Natsume's vision...

98
00:07:42,567 --> 00:07:44,650
...it entailed that
the military police

99
00:07:44,733 --> 00:07:48,733
and Special Operations Division
would oversee the day,

100
00:07:48,817 --> 00:07:51,650
the Port Mafia would
oversee the night,

101
00:07:51,733 --> 00:07:55,150
and finally, the Armed Detective
Agency would oversee

102
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:59,900
the twilight, thus maintaining
order in the city.

103
00:07:59,983 --> 00:08:02,025
After implementing
his frame work,

104
00:08:02,108 --> 00:08:04,983
Master Natsume disappeared
from the public eye.

105
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:08,275
There was one important thing
we never did learn about him:

106
00:08:08,358 --> 00:08:12,567
The exact nature of
his special ability.

107
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:16,900
Fukuzawa, there's something I'd
like to tell you before I die.

108
00:08:16,983 --> 00:08:18,192
[YUKICHI]
Hm?

109
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,025
[OUGAI] The Detective Agency
and the Port Mafia

110
00:08:20,108 --> 00:08:21,942
are not of equal value.

111
00:08:22,025 --> 00:08:25,525
If you die, the fighting between
our organizations will cease.

112
00:08:25,608 --> 00:08:28,650
However, if I am to die here,

113
00:08:28,733 --> 00:08:31,817
the Mafia will become akin
to a vengeful spirit,

114
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:35,317
escalating this feud to an
even more gruesome state.

115
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:42,067
[thud]

116
00:08:52,025 --> 00:08:54,692
[ATSUSHI] Katai was Kunikida's
friend for over a decade

117
00:08:54,775 --> 00:08:56,817
and now he's dead.

118
00:08:56,900 --> 00:09:00,108
I don't know if Kunikida
can really handle it.

119
00:09:00,192 --> 00:09:03,525
Katai's always been a
troublesome individual.

120
00:09:03,608 --> 00:09:04,775
I dragged him out of his room

121
00:09:04,858 --> 00:09:07,650
and made him join the
Armed Detective Agency,

122
00:09:07,733 --> 00:09:10,192
but even then, he'd just
bring his futon to the office

123
00:09:10,275 --> 00:09:12,733
and live there like that.

124

called Yoshiko, right?

I noticed in that footage.

What did you see?

127
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,942

When Katai was shot,

128
00:09:25,025 --> 00:09:28,233
the futon he was under
wasn't Yoshiko.

129
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:29,608
He wouldn't use another futon

130
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:32,150
unless he had a good
reason to do so.

131
00:09:32,233 --> 00:09:37,067
I'm guessing the one from
the video was bullet-proof.

132
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:40,192
In other words...
he's still alive.

133

himself outta that mess?

That's what I still don't get.

enough to deceive Fyodor.

[OUGAI] I could not have
won by might alone,

to all those things

illegal activities,

the bombing attempt on
the police building...

Somehow all these
disasters were prevented.

And now, three days ago when

[NATSUME]
Heh.

161
00:11:23,942 --> 00:11:27,733
Young Katai here has figured out
where the Rats are hiding.

162
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:30,900
But the enemy is the
epitome of craftiness.

163

If they realize they're being
pursued, they'll disappear,

never to be found
or captured again.

this opportunity?

They don't know if one of us
has actually died yet.

168
00:11:45,983 --> 00:11:48,358
Until they learn the
outcome of our battle,

169
00:11:48,442 --> 00:11:50,192
they'll stay close to home.

need to succeed.

You're gonna reopen my stiches.

00:12:27,608 --> 00:12:30,525
This is our retaliation mission
to save our president.

Why is he even here?

It's all part of my plan,
just trust me.

188

The two of you are gonna sneak
into the enemy hideout together.

Huh?

190
00:12:39,608 --> 00:12:42,817
[OSAMU] The enemy base is in
an old, abandoned coal mine.

191
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,608
The interior is several
hundred kilometers wide,

192
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:49,525
and equipped with sensors
and traps to stop intruders.

193
00:12:49,608 --> 00:12:52,733
Our main target is the gifted
who controls the virus.

Unless we can disable
his special ability,

195
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:56,858
both leaders could die.

196
00:12:56,942 --> 00:13:00,983
Our secondary target is
the mastermind, Fyodor.

197
00:13:01,067 --> 00:13:04,317
Isn't this all the more
reason not to involve him?

198
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,650
This mission's important,

199
00:13:05,733 --> 00:13:08,275
and you know how much
Akutagawa hates my guts.

200
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,108
I doubt he'd agree to
work with me anyway.

201
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:13,275
Well, Akutagawa? You in?

202
00:13:13,358 --> 00:13:17,067
If that's the plan,
I can do it.

203
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:20,025
[ATSUSHI] Why is he so
focused all of a sudden?

204
00:13:20,108 --> 00:13:21,858
Did you know it's
been four years

205
00:13:21,942 --> 00:13:23,608
since you've been
under my command?

206
00:13:23,692 --> 00:13:27,900
I'm hoping to see you're a
little more capable than before.

[AKUTAGAWA]
Yes.

Are you sure you're Akutagawa?

Yes.

210
00:13:33,817 --> 00:13:36,483
You're actually gonna
team up and fight with me?

211
00:13:36,567 --> 00:13:37,650
Yes.

212
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,650
What did you have for

213
00:13:40,733 --> 00:13:42,442
Yes.

[ATSUSHI]
That sure is a lotta guards.

216
00:13:49,692 --> 00:13:52,483
[OSAMU] They all have
wireless communicators, too.

217
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:55,733
Their people will know
right away if we charge in.

218
00:13:55,817 --> 00:13:57,400
There's a sensor at the entrance

219
00:13:57,483 --> 00:14:00,358
to counter
Junichirou's illusions.

220
00:14:00,442 --> 00:14:02,858
Also, their vital signs
are being monitored

221
00:14:02,942 --> 00:14:06,025
and continuously transmitted
back to their headquarters.

222
00:14:06,108 --> 00:14:09,317
If the guards even so much as
become excited or nervous,

223
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:12,275
they'll know instantly
that something's wrong.

224
00:14:12,358 --> 00:14:14,567
[ATSUSHI]
We can't let them get worried,

00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:17,108
let alone just go in
and take them out.

rules for you, weretiger.

are you going to--?

Well, he certainly made
that look easy enough.

to work as well.

this is my first opportunity to
prove to him that I am superior.

if you were taken out early.

[AKUTAGAWA]
That was sluggish of me.

242
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:37,817
What I should do is cut
you down and report later

243
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:39,692
that you were apprehended.

244

if you wanna go at it.

But now's not
the time for this!

We'd just be giving the
target a chance to escape.

You're too obsessed
with the kill

to even look two
feet ahead of you.

251

and left you without a word!

314
00:18:37,692 --> 00:18:41,567
We know someone named Katai
who might be able to hack it.

315
00:18:43,025 --> 00:18:44,858
You work for us now.

316
00:18:44,942 --> 00:18:46,900
The Port Mafia will
pay you tenfold

317
00:18:46,983 --> 00:18:48,233
what you were paid before.

318
00:18:48,317 --> 00:18:49,067
Uh--

319
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,608
[BOTH chuckle]

320
00:18:50,692 --> 00:18:53,483
Well, looks like Lady Luck's
shinin' down on the two of us.

321
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,733
Thank you.

322
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:16,358
Now then, Port Mafia friend.

323
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:19,275
Has the cannibalism
ended as planned?

324
00:19:19,358 --> 00:19:22,442
It seems our boss and
Fukuzawa fought in a duel.

325
00:19:22,525 --> 00:19:25,858
For reasons we don't know,
there was an explosion.

326
00:19:25,942 --> 00:19:28,275
It's unclear if
they're alive or not.

327
00:19:28,358 --> 00:19:29,858
That's too bad.

328
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,817
[PORT MAFIA AGENT] Look, I gave
you the information you wanted.

329
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:35,067
Please, deactivate the bomb.

330
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:36,817
Oh, my apologies.

331
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,942
You can disable the
device in your necktie

332
00:19:39,025 --> 00:19:41,525
by removing the blue wire.

333
00:19:50,650 --> 00:19:52,733
[sighs]

334
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,358
[FYODOR D.]
Now, let me see...

335
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:59,483
[ATSUSHI] Do you think
you can open it, Katai?

336
00:19:59,567 --> 00:20:02,192
[KATAI]
Maybe. It's an isolated network.

337
00:20:02,275 --> 00:20:03,817
But it could be pretty
tricky to pull off

338
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,400
with my connection speed.

339
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:06,608
Then I would suggest you

340
00:20:06,692 --> 00:20:09,150
prioritize locating
the virus user.

341
00:20:09,233 --> 00:20:11,317
If we aren't able
to track them down,

342
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,275
the boss' life is forfeit.

343
00:20:13,358 --> 00:20:16,400
You got it! Just gimme a little
more time with that, bro.

344
00:20:16,483 --> 00:20:18,442
[AKUTAGAWA]
Did you just call me "bro"?

345
00:20:18,525 --> 00:20:20,108
I'll kill you.

346
00:20:23,233 --> 00:20:25,192
[ATSUSHI]
Hey, Akutagawa.

347
00:20:25,275 --> 00:20:28,317
Why do you think Dazai
made us work together?

348
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,192
[AKUTAGAWA] Only a fool would
try to understand Dazai.

349
00:20:31,275 --> 00:20:35,067
Questioning his motives is
an exercise in futility.

350
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,775
I have a question
for you in return.

351
00:20:38,858 --> 00:20:42,233
Why did you decide to
participate in this operation?

352
00:20:42,317 --> 00:20:44,400
Risking your life for another?

353
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:46,400
I can't comprehend
such behavior

354
00:20:46,483 --> 00:20:49,483
coming from someone
as cowardly as you.

355
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,900
I just feel the need
to help is all.

356
00:20:51,983 --> 00:20:53,608
Why is that?

357
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:56,275
I guess because
it's the right to do.

358
00:20:56,358 --> 00:20:59,025
Based on what?

359
00:20:59,108 --> 00:21:00,692
[ORPHANAGE MAN A]
Those who cannot save others

360
00:21:00,775 --> 00:21:03,358
do not deserve to live.

361
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,025
[KATAI]
Guys! I got it!

362
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:13,983
Our target, Pushkin,
I know where he's located!

363
00:21:14,067 --> 00:21:15,192
What? Where is he?

364
00:21:15,275 --> 00:21:17,525
[KATAI] Very close.
About two meters away.

365
00:21:17,608 --> 00:21:18,400
Behind you!

366
00:21:18,483 --> 00:21:19,483

[PUSHKIN laughing]

368
00:21:27,192 --> 00:21:28,858
Looks like I missed.

369
00:21:28,942 --> 00:21:30,900
But it's no big deal.

370
00:21:31,942 --> 00:21:34,233

[AKUTAGAWA]
Get in!

375
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,608
[ATSUSHI]
Akutagawa!

376
00:21:59,692 --> 00:22:01,817
Don't underestimate
small wounds!

377
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:04,525
As someone with a much
weaker power than yours,

378
00:22:04,608 --> 00:22:07,567
it puts a smile on my
face to see you suffer!

379
00:22:07,650 --> 00:22:08,817
[ATSUSHI]
You okay?

380
00:22:13,275 --> 00:22:15,150
[ATSUSHI]
This is...

381
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:17,608
...the virus ability.

382
00:23:52,192 --> 00:23:54,525
[AKUTAGAWA]
This gifted is quite adept.

We'll take him down
within a minute

384
00:23:56,442 --> 00:23:58,650
and then go after the tram.

[ATSUSHI] Akutagawa. Are you
thinking what I'm thinking?

00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,942
[AKUTAGAWA]
Of course. How many times
