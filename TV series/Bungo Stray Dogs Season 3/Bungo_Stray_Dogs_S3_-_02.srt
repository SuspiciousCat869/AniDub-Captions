1
00:00:14,108 --> 00:00:18,108
[SOLDIER] Put your arms up.
Slowly turn around.

2
00:00:18,192 --> 00:00:21,775
I don't know why they called
in backup for a couple of kids.

3
00:00:21,858 --> 00:00:24,525
Is the Port Mafia
that short-staffed?

4
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,567
Or is this Rando
guy not included

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:28,775
on the most popular list?

6
00:00:28,858 --> 00:00:30,192
[CHUUYA]
Rando?

7
00:00:30,275 --> 00:00:31,942
That would be the
name of the survivor

8
00:00:32,025 --> 00:00:34,733
we came here to interview.

9
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:36,150
He's the one who restrained you

10
00:00:36,233 --> 00:00:38,150
with that special
ability of his.

11
00:00:38,233 --> 00:00:40,650
Oh, that guy.

12
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,108
Hey, ya old fart!

13
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,775
Whaddya say we save
us both some time?

14
00:00:44,858 --> 00:00:46,275
First, you shoot.

15
00:00:46,358 --> 00:00:48,483
Then I'll retaliate
by blowing your ass

16
00:00:48,567 --> 00:00:50,650
all the way over
to the next town.

17
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:52,900
After that, I'll beat
the living shit

18
00:00:52,983 --> 00:00:55,233
out of the rest of your men,

19
00:00:55,317 --> 00:00:57,442
and then we can
all call it a day.

20
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:58,775
[SOLDIER]
What?

21
00:00:58,858 --> 00:01:01,150
Or you could simply trick him

22
00:01:01,233 --> 00:01:04,025
into giving you
some information.

23
00:01:04,108 --> 00:01:08,650
Let me guess--you're with the
GSS tactical team, aren't you?

24
00:01:08,733 --> 00:01:11,817
The infamous Gerhardt
Security Services.

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:15,275
You used to be a foreign-funded
private security firm.

26
00:01:15,358 --> 00:01:17,775
But then you had
your subsidies cut off.

27
00:01:17,858 --> 00:01:20,108
Now you're a full-blown
illegal operation.

28
00:01:20,192 --> 00:01:22,358
[SOLDIER] That's right, and
don't think I'll go easy on ya

29
00:01:22,442 --> 00:01:23,192
just 'cause you're kids.

30
00:01:23,275 --> 00:01:24,442
[chuckles]

31
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:27,275
Show us what you got, old fart.

32
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:39,025
[SOLDIER]
You...

33
00:01:39,108 --> 00:01:41,858
You're Chuuya Nakahara
of the Sheep gang.

34
00:01:41,942 --> 00:01:44,108
So it was true that you
fell into the hands

35
00:01:44,192 --> 00:01:46,108
of the Port Mafia.

36
00:01:49,483 --> 00:01:52,817
That outta teach you,
you annoying prick!

37
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,692
[OSAMU]
You are so amazing. Well done.

38
00:01:55,775 --> 00:01:58,567
[CHUUYA] Says the guy who was
standing there doing nothing.

39
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,733
I'll have you know I was
collecting information

40
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:03,775
from the communicator I
swiped off our new friend.

41
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:06,067
Just so you know,
he wasn't lying.

42
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:08,608
It looks like he does
have some backup coming.

43
00:02:08,692 --> 00:02:09,442
Oh, yeah?

44
00:02:09,525 --> 00:02:10,692
[OSAMU groans]

45
00:02:10,775 --> 00:02:12,733
You only end up creating
more work for yourself

46
00:02:12,817 --> 00:02:14,233
when you act so impulsively.

47
00:02:14,317 --> 00:02:16,525
[footsteps]

48
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,983
[SOLDIER A]
Captain!

49
00:02:25,067 --> 00:02:27,483
Care to join your
superior on the ground?

50
00:02:27,567 --> 00:02:28,942
Fire!

51
00:02:29,025 --> 00:02:31,608
That shrimp is Chuuya Nakahara,
the gravity manipulator.

52
00:02:31,692 --> 00:02:32,817
What?!

53
00:02:47,025 --> 00:02:50,150
[CHUUYA] Did you just call
me a shrimp, you asshole?

54
00:02:50,233 --> 00:02:51,275
[SOLDIERS gasp]

55
00:02:51,358 --> 00:02:54,150
[CHUUYA]
I'm only 15 years old.

56
00:02:54,233 --> 00:02:56,733
I'm still growing, damn it!

57
00:03:12,733 --> 00:03:13,692
[SOLDIER D groans]

58
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:17,733
[SOLDIER E yells]

59
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,025
[thud]

60
00:03:29,525 --> 00:03:30,900
[CHUUYA]
It's over.

61
00:03:30,983 --> 00:03:34,775
Now tell me the reason
you guys attacked us.

62
00:03:34,858 --> 00:03:37,567
What do you know
about Arahabaki?

63
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:43,692
I guess we'll have to wait for
our team's investigation report.

64
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:48,067
[OSAMU] How unfortunate
for you. Does it hurt?

65
00:03:48,150 --> 00:03:51,192
It's a shame it's too
late to save you.

66
00:03:51,275 --> 00:03:52,775
And you won't be
dead for at least

67
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,775
another five minutes or so.

68
00:03:54,858 --> 00:03:57,442
That's five minutes
of brutal suffering.

69
00:03:57,525 --> 00:04:00,025
I wouldn't be able to stand it.

70
00:04:01,567 --> 00:04:05,067
I could end your suffering
right now by using this gun.

71
00:04:05,150 --> 00:04:06,483
If that's what you want,

72
00:04:06,567 --> 00:04:10,650
you should say yes
while you can still talk.

73
00:04:10,733 --> 00:04:12,525
Yes, shoot me.

74
00:04:16,483 --> 00:04:17,858
[OSAMU]
All right.

75
00:04:20,442 --> 00:04:23,858
[OSAMU chuckling]

76
00:04:23,942 --> 00:04:26,400
This is more than you deserve.

77
00:04:34,233 --> 00:04:37,192
There's no need to keep
shooting a dead body.

78
00:04:39,067 --> 00:04:42,275
Yeah, you're right. Absolutely.

79
00:04:44,358 --> 00:04:47,108
[OSAMU] What you're saying
is probably correct.

80
00:04:47,192 --> 00:04:49,650
That would be the
normal way to think.

81
00:06:22,108 --> 00:06:23,733
[RANDO shivers]

82
00:06:23,817 --> 00:06:25,567
[RANDO]
It's so cold.

83
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:26,942
The wind is coming through

84
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:30,442
and it makes it
three times as cold.

85
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:33,567
It must've been
rough, huh, Rando?

86
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,983
[RANDO] It was barbaric.
Why did they target me?

87
00:06:37,067 --> 00:06:40,858
[OSAMU] I think it's easy to
guess why we were attacked.

88
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:43,317
The rumor is spreading.

89
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,692
If an explosion of black
flames happened to kill

90
00:06:45,775 --> 00:06:47,692
a Mori supporter like you,

91
00:06:47,775 --> 00:06:48,900
people would take the anger

92
00:06:48,983 --> 00:06:51,900
of the former boss
more seriously.

93
00:06:51,983 --> 00:06:55,233
On the way here, Chuuya
flattened a GSS soldier

94
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:56,983
who was carrying
these instructions

95
00:06:57,067 --> 00:07:00,108
for how to fake the
perfect black explosion.

96
00:07:00,192 --> 00:07:03,275
[RANDO]
What's a "black explosion"?

97
00:07:03,358 --> 00:07:04,775
Apparently it's
what they're calling

98
00:07:04,858 --> 00:07:06,483
this type of black-ish flame.

99
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:10,775
It's the result of a reaction
caused by a sodium lamp.

100
00:07:10,858 --> 00:07:12,150
Whatever the case may be,

101
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:14,817
it's nothing more
than a cheap trick.

102
00:07:19,275 --> 00:07:21,317
So let me see if I understand.

103
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,900
The GSS soldiers
pretending to be Arahabaki

104
00:07:24,983 --> 00:07:27,858
attacked this guy in order
to get the Port Mafia

105
00:07:27,942 --> 00:07:29,400
to then turn on itself.

106
00:07:29,483 --> 00:07:32,733
[RANDO] The current GSS
president is a cold-hearted man.

107
00:07:32,817 --> 00:07:35,692
Rumor has it he has
close ties to the Guild,

108
00:07:35,775 --> 00:07:38,192
a North American
secret organization.

109
00:07:38,275 --> 00:07:41,025
Can you describe what
happened with Arahabaki?

110
00:07:41,108 --> 00:07:43,442
What you saw in Suribachi City?

111
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,400
It's the only lead
we have right now

112
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:48,858
on the previous boss
and his resurrection.

113
00:07:48,942 --> 00:07:52,483
Ah, yes. I remember
it as clear as day.

114
00:07:52,567 --> 00:07:55,858
How could I ever forget?

115
00:07:55,942 --> 00:07:58,775
I was the only one who survived.

116
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:02,275
Every single one of my
subordinates burned to ash.

117
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:06,567
They were all engulfed
by those black flames.

118
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:10,067
There's no doubt it
was that god of fire.

119
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:12,067
This is very interesting.

120
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:14,400
Please, tell us more.

121
00:08:14,483 --> 00:08:16,567
[RANDO] The terrible
blast occurred close

122
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,817
to the center of Suribachi City.

123
00:08:19,900 --> 00:08:22,608
I was with fellow agents
of the Port Mafia

124
00:08:22,692 --> 00:08:26,942
and we were on our way to battle
the young members of the Sheep.

125
00:08:28,358 --> 00:08:30,817
It was right there,
completely out of the blue,

126
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:34,150
that we were blown away
by a black explosion.

127
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:44,400
[RANDO]
A sudden massive heat wave.

128
00:08:44,483 --> 00:08:47,192
The only thing I could do
was try to protect myself

129
00:08:47,275 --> 00:08:48,775
with my ability.

130
00:08:50,775 --> 00:08:54,192
[RANDO]
Black flames. Crumbling earth.

131
00:08:54,275 --> 00:08:57,275
It was Hell itself.

132
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:02,192
And in the middle of
the inferno, there it was.

133
00:09:02,275 --> 00:09:05,400
It had no resemblance
to the former boss.

134
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:06,733
None!

135
00:09:06,817 --> 00:09:11,858
It was unrecognizable.
It wasn't even human.

136
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:23,567
It was a beast.
A beast of black flames.

137
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:25,358
It was horrendous.

138
00:09:25,442 --> 00:09:30,317
Even its eyes were like
the flames of purgatory.

139
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:34,150
Everything in sight was
shimmering in the extreme heat.

140
00:09:34,233 --> 00:09:37,067
Except the Yokohama sea.

141
00:09:37,150 --> 00:09:42,858
Just the sea, in the distance,
basking gently in the moonlight.

142
00:09:42,942 --> 00:09:46,525
That is my most vivid memory.

143
00:09:46,608 --> 00:09:49,650
[roaring]

144
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,233
[RANDO] At that moment,
I heard the voice of the beast.

145
00:09:53,317 --> 00:09:57,108
It was a voice utterly
devoid of emotion.

146
00:09:57,192 --> 00:10:00,067
It absolutely terrified me.

147
00:10:02,692 --> 00:10:03,900
[RANDO]
I apologize.

148
00:10:03,983 --> 00:10:05,733
You two wanted to
hear the former boss

149
00:10:05,817 --> 00:10:08,025
was not resurrected
by Arahabaki,

150
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,067
and that it was all
a hoax orchestrated

151
00:10:10,150 --> 00:10:12,150
by a gifted enemy, didn't you?

152
00:10:12,233 --> 00:10:13,525
[OSAMU]
Not at all.

153
00:10:13,608 --> 00:10:17,025
It was certainly
an interesting story.

154
00:10:17,108 --> 00:10:21,442
It's thanks to you the
mystery is finally solved.

155
00:10:23,442 --> 00:10:24,775
Huh?!

156
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,442
[CHUUYA]
Tell me who's behind it!

157
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:33,817
[OSAMU]
No way!

158
00:10:38,983 --> 00:10:40,150
[OSAMU]
Hup!

159
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:41,275
[CHUUYA]
Agh!

160
00:10:44,817 --> 00:10:46,483
[CHUUYA]
You don't get it, do you?!

161
00:10:46,567 --> 00:10:48,192
[OSAMU]
Oh, I do.

162
00:10:48,275 --> 00:10:51,692
Unlike a certain grade-school
kid I happen to know!

163
00:10:53,983 --> 00:10:55,358
[CHUUYA]
Come on, come on!

164
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,400
You're never gonna win

165
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:57,858
if you're always
on the defensive!

166
00:10:57,942 --> 00:10:59,858
Aww. Too bad for you.

167
00:11:01,650 --> 00:11:04,192
[screams] Hang on a second!

168
00:11:08,858 --> 00:11:10,525
[VIDEO GAME VOICE]
KO!

169
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:12,442
Don't forget our little bet.

170
00:11:12,525 --> 00:11:15,858
Remember, we said whoever loses
has to obey the winner's orders,

171
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:18,025
just like a dog
obeys its master.

172
00:11:18,108 --> 00:11:19,442
[CHUUYA groans]

173
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:22,608
Now, what ingenious thing
could I have you do?

174
00:11:22,692 --> 00:11:25,108
I thought for sure
I was gonna win!

175
00:11:25,192 --> 00:11:28,608
The strength of your ability
is actually your downfall.

176
00:11:28,692 --> 00:11:31,317
In fact, it's so strong you
never learned to be cunning

177
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,150
or think strategically, whether
it's video games or riddles.

178
00:11:35,233 --> 00:11:36,817
Riddles? What the hell?!

179
00:11:36,900 --> 00:11:38,858
I've never even done
a riddle before--

180
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:40,358
let alone solved one!

181
00:11:40,442 --> 00:11:42,442
[OSAMU] All right, why
don't we have a contest

182
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:45,442
to see who can identify the
black flame culprit first?

183
00:11:45,525 --> 00:11:47,150
If you win, then we
can call it day

184
00:11:47,233 --> 00:11:49,233
and we'll break off the
bet we already made.

185
00:11:49,317 --> 00:11:51,817
But if I win, then I get
to be your master,

186
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,275
giving you doggie
commands for life!

187
00:11:54,358 --> 00:11:56,608
Fine! You got yourself
a deal, buddy!

188
00:11:56,692 --> 00:11:59,442
I can't believe you don't think
I'm cunning or strategic!

189
00:11:59,525 --> 00:12:01,150
What makes you even
think that I would ever

190
00:12:01,233 --> 00:12:03,025
show you what I have
up my sleeve?!!

191
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:05,775
I have noticed that you keep
your hands in your pockets

192
00:12:05,858 --> 00:12:07,733
whenever you attack an opponent.

193
00:12:07,817 --> 00:12:09,108
Does that have something to do

194
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,650
with what you have
up your sleeve?

195
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:14,400
[CHUUYA] How I fight is
none of your damn business.

196
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:15,692
I understand.

197
00:12:15,775 --> 00:12:18,733
So you're just being
lazy on purpose then?

198
00:12:18,817 --> 00:12:20,608
Hey, why is it that
you want to find

199
00:12:20,692 --> 00:12:23,733
the god of fire, Arahabaki,
in the first place?

200
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:25,733
Why are you so interested?

201
00:12:25,817 --> 00:12:29,150
I dunno. Why're you so
hell-bent on dying young?

202
00:12:29,233 --> 00:12:31,150
--[CHUUYA gasps]
--[OSAMU] Hm?

203
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:33,192
[OSAMU]
What's wrong?

204
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:35,150
Just shut up for a second, okay?

205
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:38,483
[OSAMU]
Eh? Oh, look who it is.

206
00:12:38,567 --> 00:12:40,317
They're wearing those
blue bracelets.

207
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:42,650
They must be Sheep
members, right?

208
00:12:42,733 --> 00:12:44,817
Is there a problem
I don't know about?

209
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:48,442
[CHUUYA] Does this seem like a
good time for them to see me?!

210
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:50,608
Hey, Chuuya Nakahara! C'mon!

211
00:12:50,692 --> 00:12:53,317
Let's hurry and get to work!
Boss' orders, ya know!

212
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,067
What are you, a mental case?!

213
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:56,817
Shut up, dammit!

214
00:12:58,525 --> 00:12:59,942
[SHIRASE]
Chuuya, there you are.

215
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,067
We've been lookin' for ya.

216
00:13:02,150 --> 00:13:04,650
Oh. Hey, guys.
I'm glad you're safe.

217
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:06,692
[SHIRASE] Listen, Akira
and Shougo were abducted

218
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,233
by the Port Mafia.

219
00:13:08,317 --> 00:13:09,983
I say we pay them
back right now.

220
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:12,608
Let's attack their base and
make those scrubs suffer.

221
00:13:12,692 --> 00:13:14,192
Just like we always do.

222
00:13:14,275 --> 00:13:15,900
[CHUUYA]
Don't worry about them.

223
00:13:15,983 --> 00:13:17,067
[SHIRASE]
Hm?

224
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:19,108
We're actually dealing
with it right now.

225
00:13:19,192 --> 00:13:20,275
You're dealing with it?

226
00:13:20,358 --> 00:13:22,317
[OSAMU]
Yep. We're dealing with it.

227
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,358
[BOTH]
Huh?

228
00:13:23,442 --> 00:13:24,942
We got it all handled
at the moment,

229
00:13:25,025 --> 00:13:28,025
but why don't you guys tell us
what you know about Arahabaki?

230
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:29,817
Got anything new?

231
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,358
Who the hell is this guy?

232
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:33,108
Think he wants to join us?

233
00:13:33,192 --> 00:13:35,025
That's one way to describe it.

234
00:13:35,108 --> 00:13:36,775
I'm sorry, but would
you guys mind

235
00:13:36,858 --> 00:13:39,067
just answering the
question that he asked?

236
00:13:39,150 --> 00:13:40,567
Please.

237
00:13:42,067 --> 00:13:44,317
Sure, I guess.

238
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,983
Well, based on the
information we gathered

239
00:13:47,067 --> 00:13:49,858
just in the past week,
rumors are off the charts

240
00:13:49,942 --> 00:13:51,567
about people seeing
the former boss

241
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:53,317
or witnessing the black flame.

242
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,483
So what's the oldest rumor
that can actually be confirmed?

243
00:13:56,567 --> 00:13:58,942
[SHIRASE] Probably the
one from eight years ago.

244
00:13:59,025 --> 00:14:01,067
When that giant explosion
at the end of the conflict

245
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:03,067
created Suribachi City.

246
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,442
Haven't heard about Arahabaki

247
00:14:04,525 --> 00:14:06,858
causing any damage
prior to that.

248
00:14:06,942 --> 00:14:09,483
Yeah, I thought that
might be the case.

249
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:12,358
Really? This weird kid thinks
he's joining the Sheep?

250
00:14:12,442 --> 00:14:14,650
The important thing is when are
we gonna come up with a plan

251
00:14:14,733 --> 00:14:16,150
to get our guys back?

252
00:14:16,233 --> 00:14:18,733
They were abducted from the
factory road past the river.

253
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:21,692
[CHUUYA] Hold on!
You went past the river?

254
00:14:21,775 --> 00:14:23,983
You went there to steal
booze again, didn't you?!

255
00:14:24,067 --> 00:14:26,442
You know how close that is
to the Port Mafia's base!

256
00:14:26,525 --> 00:14:28,567
It's right in the middle
of the conflict, you fool!

257
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:31,192
Don't you realize that's like
asking to be abducted?!

258
00:14:31,275 --> 00:14:32,733
Please stop yelling at us.

259
00:14:32,817 --> 00:14:35,983
But don't we need to uphold
our defense policy anyway?

260
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:38,525
Think of it as a
teachable moment.

261
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:39,817
Lay your hands on the Sheep

262
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:42,525
and we hit back a hundred
times harder, right?

263
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:44,817
Isn't that what you
always say, Chuuya?

264
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:47,817
Look, if someone has the
ability to make things right,

265
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,400
then it's their duty to step up.

266
00:14:50,483 --> 00:14:53,108
I'm begging you to own
that responsibility now

267
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:54,817
and use your power!

268
00:14:54,900 --> 00:14:56,650
[OSAMU]
Awesome.

269
00:14:56,733 --> 00:14:59,567
You two fellas are really
quite interesting.

270
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:01,442
It's clear that he's
the strongest one

271
00:15:01,525 --> 00:15:03,192
of your little group by far.

272
00:15:03,275 --> 00:15:06,483
Yet he acts like a sheep
in the eyes of wolves.

273
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:09,900
It turns out it's not so easy
leading an organization.

274
00:15:09,983 --> 00:15:13,108
It's a lot harder to pull off
than one could imagine.

275
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:15,067
Careful now.

276
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:17,650
Well, I'm sorry to say
you can't take him with you.

277
00:15:17,733 --> 00:15:19,567
He's still got orders
from the Port Mafia

278
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:20,733
he needs to carry out.

279
00:15:20,817 --> 00:15:21,983
[CHUUYA]
Hey!

280
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,692
What're you talking about?
That's impossible!

281
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:24,983
Aren't I right, Chuuya?

282
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:27,317
You're with the Port Mafia?

283
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:31,525
[OSAMU]
Oh, my, I'm scared. You got me.

284
00:15:31,608 --> 00:15:35,275
I'll do anything you ask,
just don't kill me.

285
00:15:35,358 --> 00:15:36,400
Oh, I know.

286
00:15:36,483 --> 00:15:38,233
I can ask Mori to
release the hostages

287
00:15:38,317 --> 00:15:41,025
as long as you spare
me from any harm.

288
00:15:41,108 --> 00:15:42,442
Uh, hey, wait!

289
00:15:42,525 --> 00:15:44,567
Who the hell gave you permission
to contact him, dammit?!

290
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,025
Are you listening to me? Hey!

291
00:15:48,108 --> 00:15:50,525
Hi, Mori? Yeah.

292
00:15:50,608 --> 00:15:52,858
We're making good progress
on the work you ordered.

293
00:15:52,942 --> 00:15:54,067
We're almost done.

294
00:15:54,150 --> 00:15:57,108
Actually I wanted
to ask you a favor.

295
00:15:57,192 --> 00:16:00,567
Is it possible you could
release the Sheep hostages?

296
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:02,442
Yup, that's right.

297
00:16:02,525 --> 00:16:05,650
Immediately. Unharmed.

298
00:16:05,733 --> 00:16:08,150
Sure. Bye.

299
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:10,692
[phone ringing]

300
00:16:10,775 --> 00:16:13,442
The guards are contacting me.

301
00:16:13,525 --> 00:16:16,108
Seriously? They've
been released?

302
00:16:17,275 --> 00:16:19,150
Just what're you playing at?

303
00:16:19,233 --> 00:16:21,400
Are we done here?

304
00:16:21,483 --> 00:16:23,942
Let's go. We've got some
work to finish up.

305
00:16:24,025 --> 00:16:25,358
[SHEEP MEMBER]
Work?

306
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,858
Chuuya doesn't do work for
anybody in the Port Mafia.

307
00:16:27,942 --> 00:16:30,483
[SHIRASE] Yeah. And you
have no more hostages.

308
00:16:30,567 --> 00:16:31,692
[SHEEP MEMBER giggles]

309
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:34,192
C'mon, Chuuya, let's go.

310
00:16:34,275 --> 00:16:36,733
Uh... Chuuya?

311
00:16:36,817 --> 00:16:40,358
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid you
guys will have to go without me.

312
00:16:40,442 --> 00:16:41,900
What are you talking about?

313
00:16:41,983 --> 00:16:44,067
Arahabaki comes first.

314
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:46,650
I made a bet that I'd find
out what's behind it,

315
00:16:46,733 --> 00:16:49,025
and I'm not gonna
lose that bet to him.

316
00:16:49,108 --> 00:16:50,442
Are you kidding me?!

317
00:16:50,525 --> 00:16:52,400
We're depending on you to
teach our enemy a lesson!

318
00:16:52,483 --> 00:16:54,900
[OSAMU]
Lay off him already.

319
00:16:54,983 --> 00:16:57,525
He is perfectly capable
of deciding for himself

320
00:16:57,608 --> 00:17:00,442
how he wishes to
use his own power.

321
00:17:00,525 --> 00:17:04,567
Even a five-year-old kid would
be able to figure out that much.

322
00:17:04,650 --> 00:17:06,442
This discussion's over.

323
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:10,400
So are all the rumors about
you actually true then?

324
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:12,067
Have you really
abandoned the Sheep

325
00:17:12,150 --> 00:17:14,400
to become a member
of the Port Mafia?

326
00:17:14,483 --> 00:17:16,858
It has nothing to do
with Port Mafia.

327
00:17:16,942 --> 00:17:19,358
This is my own problem.

328
00:17:19,442 --> 00:17:21,608
Don't you dare forget, Chuuya!

329
00:17:21,692 --> 00:17:24,483
You had no family before
the Sheep took you in!

330
00:17:24,567 --> 00:17:26,567
You had nobody in the world!

331
00:17:28,817 --> 00:17:30,150
Shit!

332
00:17:30,233 --> 00:17:33,483
[SHIRASE screaming]

333
00:17:44,983 --> 00:17:47,733
[OSAMU]
That should just about do it.

334
00:17:47,817 --> 00:17:49,400
I can't wait.

335
00:17:49,483 --> 00:17:51,858
Imagine how happy that
punk's going to be

336
00:17:51,942 --> 00:17:54,900
when he finds out he's
getting such a grand party.

337
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:57,817
All this hoopla in honor
of his new-found freedom

338
00:17:57,900 --> 00:17:59,983
from the Sheep.

339
00:18:00,067 --> 00:18:02,400
[RANDO]
Dazai.

340
00:18:02,483 --> 00:18:04,025
You said you finally discovered

341
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:06,817
who is responsible
for Arahabaki.

342
00:18:06,900 --> 00:18:09,025
Is that really true?

343
00:18:09,108 --> 00:18:13,733
Or you were lying just so you
could torment Chuuya, perhaps?

344
00:18:13,817 --> 00:18:16,192
[OSAMU]
I'm afraid both things are true.

345
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:17,942
I said what I did
in front of him

346
00:18:18,025 --> 00:18:21,067
so that he'd be interested
in taking on the bet.

347
00:18:21,150 --> 00:18:24,358
But I do happen to
know who's behind it.

348
00:18:24,442 --> 00:18:27,483
Really? Tell me who it is then.

349
00:18:27,567 --> 00:18:31,192
It's you, Rando. Admit it.

350
00:18:32,942 --> 00:18:35,150
[OSAMU]
You impersonated the former boss

351
00:18:35,233 --> 00:18:39,275
and spread rumors
about Arahabaki.

352
00:18:39,358 --> 00:18:41,983
Do you have anything to say?

353
00:18:42,067 --> 00:18:44,317
How did you come up with that?

354
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,317
[OSAMU]
Because you made a mistake.

355
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,817
A very basic mistake.

356
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,983
[RANDO]
What mistake is that?

357
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:54,358
"The sea."

358
00:18:56,608 --> 00:18:58,650
[OSAMU] It was when you
were talking earlier.

359
00:18:58,733 --> 00:19:02,650
When you said that you saw
Arahabaki and the black flames.

360
00:19:02,733 --> 00:19:05,608
[RANDO]
Just the sea, in the distance,

361
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:08,442
basking gently in the moonlight.

362
00:19:08,525 --> 00:19:11,442
That is my most vivid memory.

363
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:16,358
Oh. Yes, I did say that.

364
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:19,608
Because that's what I
saw after it happened.

365
00:19:19,692 --> 00:19:22,108
How do you figure that
that's a mistake?

366
00:19:22,192 --> 00:19:24,817
[OSAMU] Are you sure you
want me to spoil it for you?

367
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,400
[RANDO]
Tell me.

368
00:19:26,483 --> 00:19:29,733
[OSAMU] It happened close to
the center of Suribachi City,

369
00:19:29,817 --> 00:19:33,442
but Suribachi City is a
hemispherical valley basin

370
00:19:33,525 --> 00:19:36,525
that was carved out
by the explosion.

371
00:19:36,608 --> 00:19:40,483
Ah. Oh! I understand!

372
00:19:40,567 --> 00:19:41,817
[OSAMU]
Exactly.

373
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:44,608
There's no way you
could've seen the sea.

374
00:19:44,692 --> 00:19:48,483
If you were inside a giant bowl
roughly two kilometers wide,

375
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,608
the sea would never
be within sight,

376
00:19:50,692 --> 00:19:52,442
no matter how tall you stood.

377
00:19:52,525 --> 00:19:55,692
So why would you say you saw
it if that wasn't possible?

378
00:19:55,775 --> 00:19:58,108
I believed you when you
described Arahabaki,

379
00:19:58,192 --> 00:20:00,900
since it sounded like you
were telling the truth.

380
00:20:00,983 --> 00:20:03,067
So it's strange, isn't it?

381
00:20:03,150 --> 00:20:06,275
It's because you previously
had seen the sea.

382
00:20:06,358 --> 00:20:08,942
That's why you made the mistake.

383
00:20:09,025 --> 00:20:11,400
It's subtle, but I caught it.

384
00:20:11,483 --> 00:20:15,692
You saw the sea before the city
of Suribachi was ever created.

385
00:20:15,775 --> 00:20:18,942
Before the giant explosion
eight years ago,

386
00:20:19,025 --> 00:20:21,192
at the end of the conflict.

387
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:24,108
You had a bet with Chuuya

388
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,567
about who could settle
this first, right?

389
00:20:26,650 --> 00:20:28,483
Do you think you've
won that bet?

390
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:31,817
Because you're the first to
find out who was behind it all?

391
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,983
--[CHUUYA yelling]

394
00:20:37,233 --> 00:20:38,192
[RANDO]
Huh?

395
00:20:48,275 --> 00:20:52,317
I'm the one who's won the bet
with the suicidal maniac.

396
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,608
This is all your doing, Rando.

397
00:20:54,692 --> 00:20:57,233
You can't fool me.

398
00:20:57,317 --> 00:20:59,942
I saw through you from
the very beginning.

399
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:01,608
You've been lying
this whole time.

400
00:21:01,692 --> 00:21:03,233
[OSAMU]
Okay, stop!

401
00:21:03,317 --> 00:21:04,650
[CHUUYA]
Hm?

402
00:21:04,733 --> 00:21:07,733
What?! Why, you...
What the hell, man?!

403
00:21:07,817 --> 00:21:09,275
[OSAMU]
Just so you know,

404
00:21:09,358 --> 00:21:12,275
I was the one who solved it and
made the announcement first.

405
00:21:12,358 --> 00:21:14,900
In fact, I was just in
the middle of explaining

406
00:21:14,983 --> 00:21:17,150
the method behind the mystery.

407
00:21:17,233 --> 00:21:18,900
[CHUUYA]
In the middle of explaining.

408
00:21:18,983 --> 00:21:20,483
So you weren't finished.

409
00:21:20,567 --> 00:21:22,025
Then I am the winner.

410
00:21:22,108 --> 00:21:23,483
[OSAMU]
There's no way you've won,

411
00:21:23,567 --> 00:21:26,775
but I'll let you explain
your version of the riddle.

412
00:21:26,858 --> 00:21:29,275
How did you conclude that
Rando was behind it?

413
00:21:29,358 --> 00:21:31,233
[CHUUYA]
What is there to conclude?

414
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:34,567
Anyone could've figured
it out from what he said.

415
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:38,192
Every single eyewitness account
has clearly stated in the report

416
00:21:38,275 --> 00:21:40,150
that they saw the former boss.

417
00:21:40,233 --> 00:21:41,858
And then this guy comes along

418
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:45,483
and says he's seen
Arahabaki itself.

419
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:48,567
Basically you're saying there's
no such thing as gods, then?

420
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:51,775
That's how you solved the
riddle? Did I get that right?

421
00:21:51,858 --> 00:21:53,817
[CHUUYA]
No. It's the opposite.

422
00:21:53,900 --> 00:21:55,067
[RANDO]
Hm?

423
00:21:56,692 --> 00:21:59,733
I figured it out
because gods do exist.

424
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:03,692
[CHUUYA]
I'm sure of it.

425
00:22:03,775 --> 00:22:07,733
[RANDO] So you're confident
that Arahabaki exists, huh?

426
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:08,983
[CHUUYA]
Yeah.

427
00:22:09,067 --> 00:22:12,692
You saw it, too, didn't
you? Eight years ago.

428
00:22:12,775 --> 00:22:14,817
I mean, there's no way
you could've given

429
00:22:14,900 --> 00:22:18,692
such a precise account
of it otherwise.

430
00:22:18,775 --> 00:22:21,983
[RANDO] Chuuya, I have
a question for you.

431
00:22:22,067 --> 00:22:26,483
Do you know where
Arahabaki is right now?

432
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:28,192
Tell me, boy.

433
00:22:28,275 --> 00:22:31,233
[OSAMU] If you know,
you should tell him.

434
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,067
Rando's going to be executed
for endangering the Port Mafia,

435
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:38,400
so there's no harm
in letting him know.

436
00:22:38,483 --> 00:22:40,775
Dammit, what the hell
is it with everyone?

437
00:22:40,858 --> 00:22:43,067
Why does everybody
wanna meet that thing?

438
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:44,942
Jeez, it's not like
it has the power

439
00:22:45,025 --> 00:22:46,983
to revive the dead or something.

440
00:22:47,067 --> 00:22:49,442
That thing doesn't have
any kind of personality

441
00:22:49,525 --> 00:22:51,233
or even have a mind of its own.

442
00:22:51,317 --> 00:22:53,983
It's like a typhoon
or an earthquake.

443
00:22:54,067 --> 00:22:56,358
It doesn't need a personality.

444
00:22:56,442 --> 00:22:57,400
[CHUUYA]
Huh?

445
00:22:57,483 --> 00:22:59,400
It's pure destruction.

446
00:22:59,483 --> 00:23:01,483
Its devastation has no limits.

447
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:04,192
It scorches the earth,
stains the skies,

448
00:23:04,275 --> 00:23:06,233
and rumbles the air.

449
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:09,692
This thing from the other side
is unfathomable, Chuuya.

450
00:23:09,775 --> 00:23:12,608
That power is enough for me.

451
00:23:12,692 --> 00:23:15,858
Where is this thing beyond
human comprehension--

452
00:23:15,942 --> 00:23:18,608
this thing that burned me alive?

453
00:23:29,067 --> 00:23:31,900
[CHUUYA] I'll tell you
if you really wanna know.

454
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,358
Arahabaki...

455
00:23:39,192 --> 00:23:40,483
...is me.

456
00:23:40,567 --> 00:23:44,150
[gasps] What did you say?

457
00:23:44,233 --> 00:23:45,650
[RANDO chuckles]

458
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:50,275
[RANDO] I had a feeling it
might turn out to be you.

459
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:54,692
[CHUUYA] Everything before
that was just darkness.

460
00:23:54,775 --> 00:23:56,692
I was floating
aimlessly in a void.

461
00:23:56,775 --> 00:23:58,692
You see, Arahabaki isn't a god,

462
00:23:58,775 --> 00:24:00,900
and doesn't have the power
to bring back the dead.

463
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:02,650
Someone's hand broke through

464
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,817
and dragged me into
the outside world.

465
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,650
[OSAMU]
Chuuya, I have a plan.

466
00:24:06,733 --> 00:24:08,733
But you and I will
need to cooporate.

467
00:24:08,817 --> 00:24:10,525
Will you trust me?
