There's this café.

It's on the first floor
of the building

00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:20,775
where our detective agency is.

Those fights we had
with the Guild

this agency's ever seen.

[OSAMU] In the end,
it was all worth it though,

00:10:04,442 --> 00:10:06,150
[ATSUSHI]
Descending?! Buy why?

161
00:10:06,233 --> 00:10:07,108
I haven't done anything!

162
00:10:07,192 --> 00:10:08,567
[AKUTAGAWA]
Hand it to me!

163
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,983
[DOPPO] Whoever set up that chip
took advantage of the Guild

164
00:10:17,067 --> 00:10:20,483
and plotted to destroy Yokohama.

165
00:10:20,567 --> 00:10:22,108
We need to stay one step ahead

166
00:10:22,192 --> 00:10:24,317
and drag this mastermind
out of the shadows

167
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,733
before they're able to
make their next move.

168
00:10:29,317 --> 00:10:32,442
Katai! It's me! I'm comin' in!

169
00:10:32,525 --> 00:10:34,650
Look at all this
garbage lyin' around.

170
00:10:34,733 --> 00:10:36,442
There's barely enough
room to walk!

171
00:10:36,525 --> 00:10:38,608
You need to get your ass out
of the bed you never make

172
00:10:38,692 --> 00:10:40,317
and clean this place up!

173
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,817
Hey! Answer me, damnit!

174
00:10:43,900 --> 00:10:46,733
[KATAI] Ugh. I don't have
the strength to go on.

175
00:10:46,817 --> 00:10:50,150
Not again. What is it this time?

176
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:53,233
[KATAI]
Outside of my bed lies hell.

177
00:10:53,317 --> 00:10:56,525
All that is beautiful
is above the sky.

178
00:10:56,608 --> 00:10:59,608
And all that is enjoyable
is beneath the sea.

179
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:02,025
Kunikida, is this him?

180
00:11:02,108 --> 00:11:04,108
Yeah.

181
00:11:04,192 --> 00:11:06,525
Katai's ability allows
him to control machines

182
00:11:06,608 --> 00:11:09,150
that are within his sight
without touching them.

183
00:11:09,233 --> 00:11:12,192
He can process info many
times faster than normal.

184
00:11:12,275 --> 00:11:16,025
[ATSUSHI] So he can control
all the computers in this room?

185
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:21,025
[DOPPO] He's able to take
on military cyber warfare.

186
00:11:21,108 --> 00:11:22,983
Although apparently,
he can't concentrate

187
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:26,067
unless he's where he
feels most at home.

188
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,858
In other words, he needs to
be wrapped in that futon

189
00:11:28,942 --> 00:11:31,150
to use his ability.

190
00:11:31,233 --> 00:11:33,567
Even those days are behind me.

191
00:11:33,650 --> 00:11:36,983
My mind is too shaken now
for me to use my powers.

192
00:11:37,067 --> 00:11:39,317
If any piece of trash here
should be disposed of,

193
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:40,608
it should be me!

194
00:11:40,692 --> 00:11:44,358
Huh? You can't use
your ability?! Why not?!

195
00:11:44,442 --> 00:11:47,400
Well... you see, it's...

196
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:50,858
--[DOPPO] Whaddya mean
--[ATSUSHI] What does he mean

197
00:11:50,942 --> 00:11:52,817
--you're in love?!
--he's in love?!

198
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:54,858
It was three days ago.

199
00:11:54,942 --> 00:11:58,317
I met this girl who just
took my breath away.

200
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,608
Her dark, elegant hair...

201
00:12:00,692 --> 00:12:03,025
Her silhouette
as graceful as a lily...

202
00:12:03,108 --> 00:12:07,483
Her delicate aura radiating
like in a dream or an illusion.

203
00:12:07,567 --> 00:12:12,275
She stole my heart,
even from 500 meters away.

204
00:12:12,358 --> 00:12:15,275
Five hundred meters?
That's pretty far.

205
00:12:15,358 --> 00:12:17,567
So you never talked to her.

206
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:21,150
I was far too stunned at
the mere sight of her.

207
00:12:21,233 --> 00:12:24,358
I only had the strength
to take... this picture.

208
00:12:27,858 --> 00:12:29,608
[ATSUSHI] You're right,
she's really pretty.

209
00:12:29,692 --> 00:12:32,983
[KATAI]
Alas! It is a love never to be!

210
00:12:33,067 --> 00:12:38,858
Me, talk to a woman? I'm better
at bantering with moles.

211
00:12:38,942 --> 00:12:42,108
No, I must accept that
my only love is Yoshiko!

212
00:12:42,192 --> 00:12:43,150
Who's that?

213
00:12:43,233 --> 00:12:44,650
The name of his futon.

214
00:12:44,733 --> 00:12:47,775
Seriously, his futon has a name?

215
00:12:47,858 --> 00:12:49,942
[DOPPO sighs]

216
00:12:50,025 --> 00:12:53,483
At the rate we're going here,
this is gonna take a while.

217
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,150
[KATAI]
I see.

218
00:12:57,233 --> 00:12:58,150
[DOPPO]
Huh?

219
00:13:01,983 --> 00:13:05,483
[KATAI] I understand
what you need from me now.

220
00:13:07,442 --> 00:13:09,567
I need something, too.

221
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:15,275
The Detective Agency must
find that beauty again.

222
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:21,567
[sighs]

223
00:13:25,067 --> 00:13:26,067
[gasps]

224
00:13:27,317 --> 00:13:29,150
[ICHIYOU]
It's Mr. Akutagawa!

225
00:13:29,233 --> 00:13:30,900
He must be on his way home!

226
00:13:30,983 --> 00:13:33,192
'Kay. Calm down.

227
00:13:33,275 --> 00:13:37,192
Hold it together,
Higuchi. Stay cool!

228
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:42,692
Excellent work today, sir.

229
00:13:42,775 --> 00:13:45,775
What do you say
I escort you home?

230
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:48,150
[ICHIYOU]
Yes.

231
00:13:48,233 --> 00:13:50,483
It's so unassuming,
what would he say?!

232
00:13:50,567 --> 00:13:52,483
Something like...

233
00:13:52,567 --> 00:13:53,817
Would you like some tea?

234
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:59,775
And just like that he'd
invite me to come inside!

235
00:14:01,733 --> 00:14:04,567
Haven't seen you in
a while. Let's go home.

236
00:14:24,275 --> 00:14:25,900
[ICHIYOU]
That woman.

237
00:14:25,983 --> 00:14:29,650
Who... is... she?

238
00:14:38,608 --> 00:14:41,150
[ICHIYOU] Mr. Akutagawa
met up with a young woman,

239
00:14:41,233 --> 00:14:43,817
and they went home together.

240
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,233
Absurd!

241
00:14:45,317 --> 00:14:47,983
There's gotta be more to
this than meets the eye.

242
00:14:48,067 --> 00:14:51,192
Right! Like a conspiracy!

243
00:14:51,275 --> 00:14:55,025
Is she an enemy assassin?
Or maybe a secret agent?

244
00:14:55,108 --> 00:14:57,317
Either way, I need to expose her

245
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,275
and stop my superior
from being compromised.

246
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:03,442
That's right! This isn't a
matter of personal interest.

247
00:15:03,525 --> 00:15:05,192
It's a mission!

248
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:08,525
I saw them around
here yesterday.

249
00:15:08,608 --> 00:15:09,942
[ICHIYOU gasps]

250
00:15:10,025 --> 00:15:13,817
The Detective Agency?
Just what are they doing here?

251
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:17,025
[gasps] The weretiger
has a picture of her!

252
00:15:17,108 --> 00:15:21,025
Yes, that's it! She's connected
to the Detective Agency.

253
00:15:21,108 --> 00:15:23,608
However, this isn't
a good time for me

254
00:15:23,692 --> 00:15:25,983
to confront them about it.

255
00:15:26,067 --> 00:15:27,775
[OUGAI]
I forbid hostilities toward

256
00:15:27,858 --> 00:15:31,900
the Armed Detective Agency
until otherwise noted.

257
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:34,858
[ICHIYOU] But, Boss,
the Guild has been dissolved.

258
00:15:34,942 --> 00:15:37,108
Our organization is bound
to come into conflict

259
00:15:37,192 --> 00:15:39,275
with the Agency now.

260
00:15:39,358 --> 00:15:40,442
I wouldn't be the boss

261
00:15:40,525 --> 00:15:42,650
if I didn't think
these things through.

262
00:15:42,733 --> 00:15:44,650
So trust me.

263
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:46,358
Understood, sir.

264
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:49,775
[OUGAI] These instructions
apply to all members.

265
00:15:49,858 --> 00:15:52,692
Gin, please hand this
to all our units.

266
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,650
[ICHIYOU] Why did the boss
make such a decree?

267
00:16:01,733 --> 00:16:03,775
[growls]

268
00:16:03,858 --> 00:16:06,108
I don't want that lame Detective
Agency thinking less...

269
00:16:06,192 --> 00:16:07,025
Something you needed?

270
00:16:07,108 --> 00:16:09,150
[yelping]

271
00:16:09,233 --> 00:16:11,442
What does the Port Mafia want?

272
00:16:11,525 --> 00:16:13,275
As instructed by our president,

273
00:16:13,358 --> 00:16:15,775
we're ceasing any and
all conflict with you.

274
00:16:15,858 --> 00:16:19,567
But if you're gonna force
my hand, then so be it.

275
00:16:19,650 --> 00:16:20,983
[ICHIYOU]
This doesn't look good.

276
00:16:21,067 --> 00:16:24,025
It's two against one and
they're experienced in battle.

277
00:16:24,108 --> 00:16:26,650
But if it's for the
sake of my superior...

278
00:16:28,525 --> 00:16:31,692
[ICHIYOU]
...I'll do whatever it takes!

279
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,692
I'll force it out of them!

280
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,900
Please, I beg of you!

281
00:16:37,983 --> 00:16:39,900
Tell me what you know about
the woman in that picture!

282
00:16:39,983 --> 00:16:41,317
Tell me everything!

283
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,817
[BOTH]
Huh?!

284
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:45,025
Seriously?!

285
00:16:46,358 --> 00:16:49,858
[ATSUSHI] I honestly don't know
what to tell you about her.

286
00:16:49,942 --> 00:16:53,983
We know as much about this woman
as you do, unfortunately.

287
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:56,900
We're trying to find her
and deliver a love letter.

288
00:16:56,983 --> 00:16:58,192
A love letter?

289
00:16:58,275 --> 00:17:01,317
[ICHIYOU] The weretiger's
surprisingly bold.

290
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:03,317
Hey, wait a second.

291
00:17:11,567 --> 00:17:12,942
That's great!

292
00:17:14,025 --> 00:17:15,483
I'm rooting for you.

293
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:18,233
Some advice, women like to be
approached with confidence.

294
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,775
I also think you should tidy
up your bangs just a bit.

295
00:17:20,858 --> 00:17:22,233
Maybe get your clothes tailored.

296
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:23,525
[KATAI]
He's not the one who will be

297
00:17:23,608 --> 00:17:24,733
delivering the love letter!

298
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:25,983
[ALL gasp]

299
00:17:27,983 --> 00:17:29,775
Seeing that my heart
is on the line,

300
00:17:29,858 --> 00:17:32,317
it's only right that
I witness the outcome!

301
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,775
It's Katai.

302
00:17:33,858 --> 00:17:35,483
He brought his futon.

303
00:17:35,567 --> 00:17:38,400
So you're the one who
wrote the love letter?

304
00:17:38,483 --> 00:17:39,942
I'll give it to you straight.

305
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:42,983
Your chances are even worse
than the weretiger over here.

306
00:17:43,067 --> 00:17:45,442
Silence, you fool!

307
00:17:45,525 --> 00:17:48,233
The love that I feel
runs deeper than the sea!

308
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:52,067
Besides, you're with the
Port Mafia, are you not?

309
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:55,442
It's true that I've parted ways
from the Armed Detective Agency,

310
00:17:55,525 --> 00:17:58,400
but I won't team up
with the likes of you!

311
00:18:00,233 --> 00:18:02,858
Hey, kid, is there
a reason why

312
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:05,025
he's yelling over
in that direction?

313
00:18:05,108 --> 00:18:08,108
[ATSUSHI] He really is
bad at talking to women.

314
00:18:08,192 --> 00:18:09,567
[bell rings]

315
00:18:11,442 --> 00:18:12,317
It's her.

316
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:13,608
--[ICHIYOU] Huh?
--Really?!

317
00:18:18,275 --> 00:18:21,317
Ah! She's like an angel!

318
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:24,067
She just came out of
the dry cleaner's.

319
00:18:24,150 --> 00:18:26,525
Why is she carrying
Mr. Akutagawa's clothes?

320
00:18:26,608 --> 00:18:28,358
This is so unacceptable!

321
00:18:28,442 --> 00:18:31,567
I can't just sit back and
rely on a silly love letter!

322
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:33,108
I'll have to punish
this infiltrator

323
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:35,983
with my own two hands!

324
00:18:36,067 --> 00:18:38,442
You aren't getting away from me!

325
00:18:43,942 --> 00:18:46,108
Not so fast, you goon!

326
00:19:03,192 --> 00:19:05,192
[cars honking]

327
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:08,108
[gasps] What happened
to the traffic lights?

328
00:19:13,025 --> 00:19:15,233
[ICHIYOU] No normal person
moves like that.

329
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:17,483
She must be an enemy agent!

330
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:18,442
All right.

331
00:19:18,525 --> 00:19:19,525
That divine angel...

332
00:19:19,608 --> 00:19:21,942
[BOTH]
I need to get to her!

333
00:19:26,025 --> 00:19:28,942
Excellent. That
alley's a dead-end.

334
00:19:35,317 --> 00:19:36,650
[KATAI yells]

335
00:19:37,692 --> 00:19:39,733
Got you!

336
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:40,942
[gasps]

337
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,192
[KATAI screaming]

338
00:19:45,983 --> 00:19:49,400
Why did you both
follow me here, ma'am?

339
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:53,358
I know that mask
and hairstyle...

340
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:01,525
Gin?

341
00:20:04,358 --> 00:20:05,858
Yeah.

342
00:20:05,942 --> 00:20:08,150
Then that means...

343
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:11,567
...this whole time I've been
chasing Mr. Akutagawa's...

344
00:20:11,650 --> 00:20:13,983
[ALL]
Little sister?!

345
00:20:16,567 --> 00:20:21,733
[ATSUSHI] I can't believe...
you're Akutagawa's sister.

346
00:20:21,817 --> 00:20:24,233
[ICHIYOU gasping]

347
00:20:24,317 --> 00:20:26,692
You doin' okay over there?

348
00:20:26,775 --> 00:20:28,317
What now, Katai?

349
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,858
You said that you
hate the Port Mafia.

350
00:20:45,442 --> 00:20:47,483
[KATAI]
The moment I first saw you,

351
00:20:47,567 --> 00:20:50,817
I learned what the true
meaning of "beauty" was.

352
00:20:56,733 --> 00:21:02,692
[KATAI wailing]

353
00:21:09,025 --> 00:21:11,525
D'you think he'll be all right?

354
00:21:11,608 --> 00:21:14,692
Yeah. That was the whole
point of the love letter.

355
00:21:14,775 --> 00:21:16,858
Huh?

356
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:19,317
[DOPPO] You see, Katai would've
never had the courage

357
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:23,275
to express his feelings to
a woman he was interested in.

358
00:21:23,358 --> 00:21:25,525
But without a resolution,
he couldn't commit

359
00:21:25,608 --> 00:21:27,567
his mind to our investigation,

360
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:29,608
which would've been bad for me.

361
00:21:29,692 --> 00:21:33,567
So he agreed to face
his certain rejection.

362
00:21:33,650 --> 00:21:36,567
He'll start work once
he's finished crying.

363
00:21:37,817 --> 00:21:40,567
[ATSUSHI] You know Katai
really well, huh?

364
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,067
[DOPPO] I know it'll
be easier for all of us

365
00:21:44,150 --> 00:21:46,817
if he comes back to
the Detective Agency.

366
00:23:37,483 --> 00:23:41,567
[ICHIYOU] Gin, I have an
order as your superior.

367
00:23:41,650 --> 00:23:43,983
I'd like you to
call me "Big Sis."

368
00:23:51,733 --> 00:23:53,942
[KYOUKA] A few days
before Mother was killed,

369
00:23:54,025 --> 00:23:56,150
she gave me this
cellphone and told me

370
00:23:56,233 --> 00:23:58,525
that I should
never let go of it.

371
00:23:58,608 --> 00:24:02,192
Afterwards, Demon Snow
killed both of my parents.

372
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:04,483
[ATSUSHI]
The death of your parents, huh?

373
00:24:04,567 --> 00:24:07,108
All my childhood memories
are of the orphanage.

374
00:24:07,192 --> 00:24:09,942
I can't imagine
what you went through.

375
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:14,900
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,
Episode 31, Part 1: "Herurisu,"

376
00:24:14,983 --> 00:24:17,608
Part 2: "Portrait of a Father."

377
00:24:17,692 --> 00:24:20,817
[KYOUKA] Now I understand
what I saw that day.
