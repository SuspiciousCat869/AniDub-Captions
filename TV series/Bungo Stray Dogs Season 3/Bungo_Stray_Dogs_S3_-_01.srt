1
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:16,442
[ANGO] Those 88 days
produced more casualties

2
00:00:16,525 --> 00:00:19,692
than any other in Yokohama's
criminal underworld.

3
00:00:19,775 --> 00:00:21,650
Numerous organizations
were involved

4
00:00:21,733 --> 00:00:25,775
in what would be known...
as the Dragon Head Conflict.

5
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:30,650
[ANGO]
One year prior to the events...

6
00:00:41,108 --> 00:00:42,150
[gasps]

7
00:00:51,067 --> 00:00:52,817
The King of the Sheep!

8
00:00:54,858 --> 00:00:56,150
[yells]

9
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,400
[CHUUYA]
Run as much as you like...

10
00:01:01,608 --> 00:01:03,567
...but you'll never
escape gravity.

11
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:05,525
Damn monster!

12
00:01:14,817 --> 00:01:17,150
You're just the beginning.

13
00:01:17,233 --> 00:01:20,858
I'm gonna kill all
of the Port Mafia.

14
00:01:30,025 --> 00:01:33,442
[OUGAI] Things aren't
looking good for us.

15
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:37,567
Our weapon smugglers are
two weeks behind schedule.

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:39,067
If this keeps up,

17
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,150
our men will literally be
bringing knives to a gun fight.

18
00:01:43,233 --> 00:01:45,442
And while the violence
continues to rise,

19
00:01:45,525 --> 00:01:49,275
contracts for our protection
business continue to dwindle.

20
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:51,317
[OUGAI sighs]

21
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:53,983
[OUGAI]
What do you think, Dazai?

22
00:01:54,067 --> 00:01:56,608
Are we not actually
cut out for this work?

23
00:01:56,692 --> 00:01:58,442
[OSAMU]
Really now, Mori?

24
00:01:58,525 --> 00:02:01,067
Not having money,
or intel, or supplies,

25
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:03,317
or even the trust of
our subordinates.

26
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:05,400
You knew that was going
to be the situation

27
00:02:05,483 --> 00:02:06,608
from the beginning.

28
00:02:06,692 --> 00:02:08,942
That's so harsh.

29
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,108
By the way, is there
a reason you're mixing

30
00:02:11,192 --> 00:02:15,150
hypertension and
hypotension medications?

31
00:02:15,233 --> 00:02:19,067
I thought taking them together
might be a cozy way to go out.

32
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:20,775
Listen, Dazai.

33
00:02:20,858 --> 00:02:22,233
You were the sole witness

34
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:24,317
when I inherited
the boss' position,

35
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,525
so as a result,
you're the only other one

36
00:02:27,608 --> 00:02:29,650
who can verify his will.

37
00:02:29,733 --> 00:02:33,442
I can't afford to have
you senselessly die.

38
00:02:35,317 --> 00:02:38,525
[OUGAI] How are you
feeling today, Boss?

39
00:02:38,608 --> 00:02:41,567
[BOSS] Doctor, tell the
board this is an order:

40
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:45,567
Kill all enemy organizations,
military police,

41
00:02:45,650 --> 00:02:49,483
anyone else who opposes
the Port Mafia by sundown.

42
00:02:49,567 --> 00:02:51,525
[OUGAI]
That would be most unwise.

43
00:02:51,608 --> 00:02:54,650
I don't care how many
of our own need to die.

44
00:02:54,733 --> 00:02:56,067
Just kill them.

45
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,317
Just kill them all. Kill them.
Kill them. Kill every...

46
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,567
[OUGAI]
I hear you loud and clear.

47
00:03:04,858 --> 00:03:08,317
[OUGAI] The boss has
succumbed to illness.

48
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:12,067
He left behind a will
entrusting me with his position.

49
00:03:13,733 --> 00:03:17,650
You're the witness to
that fact. Understood?

50
00:03:22,192 --> 00:03:25,025
[OSAMU]
Looks like you made a mistake.

51
00:03:25,108 --> 00:03:27,733
Your reasoning to choose
someone who attempts suicide

52
00:03:27,817 --> 00:03:30,150
as your accomplice was sound,

53
00:03:30,233 --> 00:03:33,567
but here I am a year
later, still kicking.

54
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:35,650
[OUGAI]
I made no mistake.

55
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:39,817
It seems to me that you and I
were successful in our mission.

56
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,525
The mission isn't complete yet.

57
00:03:41,608 --> 00:03:44,858
I haven't been silenced and
I'm aware of the assassination.

58
00:03:44,942 --> 00:03:47,483
If I'd committed
suicide afterward,

59
00:03:47,567 --> 00:03:51,275
then I would've been
the perfect accomplice.

60
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:52,858
The reason I took my own life

61
00:03:52,942 --> 00:03:54,817
wouldn't have
mattered to anyone.

62
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:58,025
Once my testimony had already
helped you become boss,

63
00:03:58,108 --> 00:04:00,108
nobody would've suspected.

64
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,525
[OUGAI]
You remind me of someone.

65
00:04:04,608 --> 00:04:05,733
[OSAMU]
Huh?

66
00:04:05,817 --> 00:04:07,525
You know, if I was
going to shut you up,

67
00:04:07,608 --> 00:04:10,483
I could've done so
a long time ago.

68
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,567
If you'd like me to,
I can prepare something

69
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,692
that would end your
life peacefully.

70
00:04:14,775 --> 00:04:16,233
You could?

71
00:04:16,317 --> 00:04:19,400
[OUGAI] But in exchange, I want
you to do something for me.

72
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:22,192
It's nothing serious. You won't
be in any kind of danger.

73
00:04:22,275 --> 00:04:23,275
No big deal.

74
00:04:23,358 --> 00:04:24,733
[OSAMU]
I'm not buyin' it.

75
00:04:24,817 --> 00:04:27,567
[OUGAI] I trust you already
know about Suribachi City

76
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:29,567
in the Yokohama settlement.

77
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,025
There's a rumor that a certain
individual from the past

78
00:04:33,108 --> 00:04:35,025
has been sighted in that area.

79
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:38,608
I want you to go and
investigate this rumor.

80
00:04:38,692 --> 00:04:43,025
Take this contract with you.
It's called the "Silver Oracle."

81
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:45,858
Show this to any member
of the Port Mafia

82
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,275
and they will do whatever
you ask of them.

83
00:04:48,358 --> 00:04:49,817
Who's the rumor about?

84
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:51,358
[OUGAI]
Take a guess.

85
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:56,025
[OSAMU] Huh. It'd be a rumor you
don't want picking up speed.

86
00:04:56,108 --> 00:05:00,650
Ah. I see. It'd have to
be him, wouldn't it?

87
00:05:00,733 --> 00:05:03,983
The subject of the rumors
has to be the previous boss.

88
00:05:04,067 --> 00:05:05,567
[OUGAI]
Precisely.

89
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:08,692
There are some people who must
never raise from their graves.

90
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:11,567
I trust you understand
where I'm coming from.

91
00:05:11,650 --> 00:05:13,900
[OSAMU]
Just make me that drug.

92
00:05:13,983 --> 00:05:16,983
[OUGAI] This will be
your first official job.

93
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,775
Welcome to the Port Mafia.

94
00:05:23,900 --> 00:05:24,900
[OSAMU]
Oh, right.

95
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:26,233
[OUGAI]
Huh?

96
00:05:26,317 --> 00:05:30,525
Who was this "someone"
you said I reminded you of?

97
00:05:30,608 --> 00:05:33,525
Myself, of course.

98
00:05:33,608 --> 00:05:37,400
Tell me, Dazai, why
is it you wish to die?

99
00:05:37,483 --> 00:05:40,317
[OSAMU]
Let's turn that question around.

100
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:45,608
Is there really any value
to this thing we call "living"?

101
00:05:53,192 --> 00:05:55,692
[HIROTSU]
The Yokohama foreign settlement.

102
00:05:55,775 --> 00:05:58,233
There was once a
giant explosion here.

103
00:05:58,317 --> 00:06:01,108
In the resulting crater,
people began building

104
00:06:01,192 --> 00:06:05,150
what would eventually become
known as Suribachi City.

105
00:06:05,233 --> 00:06:07,483
[OSAMU]
Hmm...

106
00:06:07,567 --> 00:06:12,067
They drink metal plating to
kill themselves overseas, huh?

107
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,567
Wait.

108
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,317
But it melts down their organs
while they're still alive?

109
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,317
Yuck. Glad I never tried that.

110
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,942
Hey, did you know about
that? Mister, uhh...

111
00:06:23,025 --> 00:06:24,650
[HIROTSU]
It's Hirotsu.

112
00:06:24,733 --> 00:06:28,567
I'll keep that fact
in mind, thank you.

113
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:30,525
[HIROTSU] This is the boy
who was with the boss

114
00:06:30,608 --> 00:06:33,025
when the previous
boss passed away.

115
00:06:33,108 --> 00:06:35,025
I shouldn't underestimate him.

116
00:06:35,108 --> 00:06:36,775
[gasps]

117
00:06:36,858 --> 00:06:37,983
Dazai.

118
00:06:38,067 --> 00:06:39,192
[OSAMU]
Yes?

119
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,400
[HIROTSU] This area is
in a state of conflict.

120
00:06:41,483 --> 00:06:43,650
You should be careful.

121
00:06:43,733 --> 00:06:44,983
How so?

122
00:06:45,067 --> 00:06:47,192
[HIROTSU] The Port Mafia
is currently pitted

123
00:06:47,275 --> 00:06:49,525
against three organizations:

124
00:06:49,608 --> 00:06:54,108
First, Takasekai. Second, GSS.

125
00:06:54,192 --> 00:06:58,233
And finally, an army comprised
entirely of juveniles

126
00:06:58,317 --> 00:07:00,067
referred to as
the Sheep, which--

127
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,317
Boss is calling.

128
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:05,400
What's up?

129
00:07:05,483 --> 00:07:08,317
Mm-hm. I've learned
a few things.

130
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,608
Long story short,

131
00:07:10,692 --> 00:07:14,233
I found the whereabouts
of the previous boss.

132
00:07:14,317 --> 00:07:18,483
Looks like he came back.
Straight from the pits of Hell.

133
00:07:18,567 --> 00:07:21,900
Mm-hm. I'll give you a proper
report when I get b--

134
00:07:21,983 --> 00:07:23,358
What was that?!

135
00:07:28,567 --> 00:07:31,608
[CHUUYA laughs]

136
00:07:31,692 --> 00:07:34,233
[CHUUYA]
Ahh. This is perfect.

137
00:07:34,317 --> 00:07:35,900
It's just a kid!

138
00:07:35,983 --> 00:07:38,442
They're really scrapping
the bottom of the barrel,

139
00:07:38,525 --> 00:07:40,150
those Port Mafia.

140
00:07:40,233 --> 00:07:43,442
I think you should know
I really hate pain.

141
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:46,025
I'm gonna give you two choices.

142
00:07:46,108 --> 00:07:49,358
Die now, or die after
giving me information.

143
00:07:49,442 --> 00:07:51,067
Either's fine with me.

144
00:07:51,150 --> 00:07:52,858
Kill me now, then.

145
00:07:52,942 --> 00:07:55,733
If you can make it
painless, all the better.

146
00:07:55,817 --> 00:07:59,525
[CHUUYA] Sheesh. What kinda
suicidal punk are you?

147
00:07:59,608 --> 00:08:01,608
[OSAMU]
You're a punk, too, ya know.

148
00:08:01,692 --> 00:08:05,858
[CHUUYA] Except unlike you,
I'm not just any punk.

149
00:08:05,942 --> 00:08:07,900
Enough of this chit-chat.

150
00:08:07,983 --> 00:08:11,317
Tell me about this "Arahabaki"
you're lookin' for.

151
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,150
Oh? Arahabaki?

152
00:08:15,233 --> 00:08:17,858
How interesting.
So that's the target.

153
00:08:17,942 --> 00:08:19,233
You've heard about it then.

154
00:08:19,317 --> 00:08:21,483
[OSAMU]
Nope. Never have.

155
00:08:24,233 --> 00:08:26,692
"Those who step into
the Sheep's territory

156
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:30,650
will be met with
vicious retaliation."

157
00:08:30,733 --> 00:08:34,608
I see. So you're the
King of the Sheep.

158
00:08:34,692 --> 00:08:37,483
Chuuya Nakahara,
manipulator of gravity.

159
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,567
I'm not their King, all right?

160
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:42,150
But I do have a trump
card up my sleeve.

161
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:45,817
[OSAMU] Oh. You're a cocky,
over-confident child.

162
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,192
I hate people like you so much.

163
00:08:48,275 --> 00:08:49,525
[CHUUYA]
Oh, yeah?

164
00:08:49,608 --> 00:08:52,233
Well, I hate condescending
little pricks like you

165
00:08:52,317 --> 00:08:54,150
more than anything
in this world.

166
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:55,775
[HIROTSU]
That's enough of that.

167
00:08:55,858 --> 00:08:56,983
[CHUUYA]
Huh?

168
00:08:59,525 --> 00:09:01,733
Come quietly, or else.

169
00:09:01,817 --> 00:09:05,275
[CHUUYA] Ooh, I'm shakin'
in my boots, old man.

170
00:09:05,358 --> 00:09:07,567
Do you even know who I am?

171
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:09,275
The King of the Sheep, was it?

172
00:09:09,358 --> 00:09:10,817
[CHUUYA]
No, dumbass!

173
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,692
I just happen to have
a good card up my sleeve.

174
00:09:13,775 --> 00:09:16,692
The card of power, perhaps?

175
00:09:16,775 --> 00:09:19,108
So you're a gifted, too, huh?

176
00:09:19,192 --> 00:09:20,525
Be careful.

177
00:09:20,608 --> 00:09:23,775
This kid controls the gravity
of anything he touches.

178
00:09:23,858 --> 00:09:25,608
Understood.

179
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:37,983
Is that all you've got, old man?
I was expecting a little more.

180
00:09:38,067 --> 00:09:40,358
Don't disappoint me now!

181
00:09:46,192 --> 00:09:47,525
Too slow.

182
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:52,525
[HIROTSU]
It's all over for you now.

183
00:09:52,608 --> 00:09:54,692
What're you talking
about? I've beaten you.

184
00:09:54,775 --> 00:09:57,525
[OSAMU]
You sure about that?

185
00:09:57,608 --> 00:10:00,692
You've lost your ability
to control gravity now.

186
00:10:00,775 --> 00:10:02,067
Oh?

187
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,733
[OSAMU] I'm able to nullify
the powers of others.

188
00:10:06,067 --> 00:10:08,733
[HIROTSU]
Now, boy.

189
00:10:08,817 --> 00:10:10,567
It's time you faced a reckoning.

190
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:11,692
[gasps]

191
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,400
[OSAMU]
He got me.

192
00:10:19,483 --> 00:10:23,192
Right before you could use your
special ability, he kicked me.

193
00:10:23,275 --> 00:10:26,567
Once I let go, he was able
to use his powers again.

194
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,567
He used his gravity
ability to fly backwards,

195
00:10:30,650 --> 00:10:32,317
and got away unscathed.

196
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,942
[CHUUYA] I'll deal
with you later, twerp.

197
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,275
Let's go, "Grandpa."

198
00:10:36,358 --> 00:10:37,400
[OSAMU]
Watch out!

199
00:11:02,775 --> 00:11:04,650
The old boss.

200
00:11:12,858 --> 00:11:15,608
[OUGAI]
You must be Chuuya Nakahara.

201
00:11:15,692 --> 00:11:17,733
Welcome to the Port Mafia.

202
00:11:17,817 --> 00:11:20,858
Thank you for the
warm invitation.

203
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:26,358
[OUGAI] I hear you put my men
through their paces yesterday.

204
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,150
[CHUUYA]
Yeah, but we were interrupted

205
00:11:28,233 --> 00:11:30,483
thanks to a "mystery guest."

206
00:11:30,567 --> 00:11:33,775
But I'm guessing
that's why I'm here.

207
00:11:33,858 --> 00:11:36,650
Why are you
investigating Arahabaki?

208
00:11:36,733 --> 00:11:38,025
[door opens]

209
00:11:39,192 --> 00:11:41,358
[OUGAI]
Ah, Dazai.

210
00:11:41,442 --> 00:11:43,192
You've arrived.

211
00:11:44,275 --> 00:11:47,108
Huh? You're that kid with a
death wish from yesterday!

212
00:11:47,192 --> 00:11:50,358
[OSAMU] And I see that
you're as lively as ever.

213
00:11:50,442 --> 00:11:54,817
Thanks to you, I'm sporting
some pretty bad injuries here.

214
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,775
Having only known each
other for a day,

215
00:11:56,858 --> 00:11:58,775
you two seem to have
really hit it off.

216
00:11:58,858 --> 00:11:59,983
Huh?

217
00:12:00,067 --> 00:12:02,108
Now then, I'd like
to talk to you

218
00:12:02,192 --> 00:12:04,775
about what happened
yesterday, Chuuya.

219
00:12:04,858 --> 00:12:08,233
Rando, would you
please release him?

220
00:12:08,317 --> 00:12:11,275
[RANDO] Sir, I don't believe
that would be very prudent.

221
00:12:11,358 --> 00:12:13,108
This boy is quite dangerous.

222
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:15,608
[OUGAI]
I have measures in place.

223
00:12:15,692 --> 00:12:19,650
By the way, Rando,
you look colder than usual.

224
00:12:19,733 --> 00:12:21,025
Are you all right?

225
00:12:21,108 --> 00:12:23,900
[RANDO] Much to my
embarrassment, I'm freezing.

226
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,275
I feel I could die
at any minute.

227
00:12:26,358 --> 00:12:28,817
You're cold?
Dressed in all that?

228
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,358
You may step down.

229
00:12:31,442 --> 00:12:33,483
[RANDO]
Thank you, sir.

230
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:35,650
If you would excuse me.

231
00:12:37,692 --> 00:12:40,358
[CHUUYA] It's not even
remotely cold in here.

232
00:12:40,442 --> 00:12:42,192
Clearly he's just a wuss.

233
00:12:42,275 --> 00:12:43,692
Believe it or not,

234
00:12:43,775 --> 00:12:47,400
he's a secondary executive
and an excellent ability user.

235
00:12:47,483 --> 00:12:50,442
[CHUUYA] Psh, whatever.
That dude doesn't interest me.

236
00:12:50,525 --> 00:12:53,525
Mori, can we get to
business already?

237
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:55,650
Oh. My apologies.

238
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:56,942
Moving on.

239
00:12:57,025 --> 00:12:58,817
Would you be interested
in affiliating

240
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,400
with the Port Mafia, Chuuya?

241
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,900
Huh?

242
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,233
Well, I suppose I
should've expected that.

243
00:13:09,317 --> 00:13:11,442
I still believe that
our over-all goals

244
00:13:11,525 --> 00:13:13,692
are probably in alignment.

245
00:13:13,775 --> 00:13:15,817
Give it some time
and think it over.

246
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,650
You can make a decision
after we determine

247
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,733
what we can offer each other.

248
00:13:19,817 --> 00:13:22,275
Don't you dare make
it sound that easy.

249
00:13:22,358 --> 00:13:24,400
You forget what you've
done to this city?

250
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:26,900
[OUGAI]
Our previous boss' rampage...

251
00:13:26,983 --> 00:13:30,817
It was he, and his tyrannical
rule, that led this city

252
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:35,108
into a state of chaos and still
haunts people to this day.

253
00:13:36,233 --> 00:13:38,942
But he is no longer
with the living.

254
00:13:39,025 --> 00:13:42,608
I witnessed his passing myself.

255
00:13:42,692 --> 00:13:45,942
That's why, if rumors exist
that his rule of violence

256
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:50,150
and terror has returned,
we must discover their origins.

257
00:13:50,233 --> 00:13:52,192
For the protection
of our people.

258
00:13:52,275 --> 00:13:53,692
Mori...

259
00:13:53,775 --> 00:13:57,025
[CHUUYA] I've heard some damning
rumors about you as well.

260
00:13:57,108 --> 00:13:59,733
They say the old boss
didn't die of illness.

261
00:13:59,817 --> 00:14:02,192
That you actually
murdered the bastard.

262
00:14:02,275 --> 00:14:04,150
It is a little hard
to swallow that

263
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:05,817
right before kicking the bucket,

264
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,942
he'd give his position
to his doctor.

265
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:09,275
You're right.

266
00:14:09,358 --> 00:14:11,150
I murdered the previous boss.

267
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,567
[gasps]

268
00:14:12,650 --> 00:14:14,150
[OSAMU groans]

269
00:14:14,233 --> 00:14:16,983
[OUGAI] I used this
trusty scalpel of mine,

270
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:18,900
then I blamed on it
on his disease;

271
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,650
said it had killed
him in the end.

272
00:14:21,733 --> 00:14:23,775
Do you have a problem with that?

273
00:14:23,858 --> 00:14:25,525
[grunts]

274
00:14:25,608 --> 00:14:27,233
You're serious?

275
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:30,900
[OUGAI]
Chuuya, would you participate

276
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:33,275
in a joint investigation?

277
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:36,317
The rumors we've heard about
the previous boss' return

278
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:40,858
and this "Arahabaki" that you're
after are clearly related.

279
00:14:40,942 --> 00:14:44,233
I think we could achieve a
mutually beneficial relationship

280
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,233
simply by sharing information.

281
00:14:47,317 --> 00:14:50,025
[CHUUYA]
And if I refuse?

282
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:52,275
[SHEEP MEMBER]
Hey, Chuuya, are you there?

283
00:14:52,358 --> 00:14:53,608
We need your help.

284
00:14:53,692 --> 00:14:55,400
The Port Mafia caught us.

285
00:14:55,483 --> 00:14:57,317
You can get us
outta this, right?

286
00:14:57,400 --> 00:15:00,108
Please, come and save us,
like you always--

287
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,608
[growls]

288
00:15:02,692 --> 00:15:05,192
Your group controls prime
real estate in Yokohama,

289
00:15:05,275 --> 00:15:07,400
and even owns artillery.

290
00:15:07,483 --> 00:15:11,025
But for a group so bent on
vengeance, excluding yourself,

291
00:15:11,108 --> 00:15:13,150
all of you are no
more than children.

292
00:15:13,233 --> 00:15:14,400
As a fellow leader,

293
00:15:14,483 --> 00:15:17,275
I sympathize with your
difficult circumstances.

294
00:15:17,358 --> 00:15:18,442
Bastard.

295
00:15:18,525 --> 00:15:22,233
See that? Such bloodlust
from this one.

296
00:15:22,317 --> 00:15:25,275
It's clear the most aggressive
wielder of violence

297
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:27,817
in this room is this boy here.

298
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:32,192
But to us, violence is merely
one tool at our disposal.

299
00:15:32,275 --> 00:15:35,483
The Mafia's true nature is
to control our surroundings

300
00:15:35,567 --> 00:15:38,442
using a plethora of means.

301
00:15:38,525 --> 00:15:41,400
Boss, why are you lecturing
me about this right now?

302
00:15:41,483 --> 00:15:45,150
Indeed. Why would that be?

303
00:15:45,233 --> 00:15:48,150
[CHUUYA] I'll consider
exchanging information.

304
00:15:48,233 --> 00:15:50,733
But you're gonna have
to spill the beans first.

305
00:15:50,817 --> 00:15:53,233
We'll see how I feel afterwards.

306
00:15:53,317 --> 00:15:54,942
[OUGAI]
Very well.

307
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,400
We're investigating a rumor

308
00:15:56,483 --> 00:15:59,192
that the previous boss
has reappeared.

309
00:15:59,275 --> 00:16:01,108
Dazai's intel shows
he's been seen

310
00:16:01,192 --> 00:16:02,775
three times in two weeks.

311
00:16:02,858 --> 00:16:04,525
And in each of those cases,

312
00:16:04,608 --> 00:16:07,150
he was sighted in
Suribachi City.

313
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:10,608
You saw him the fourth time,
when he fought you yesterday

314
00:16:10,692 --> 00:16:12,983
with that flurry
of black flames.

315
00:16:13,067 --> 00:16:14,900
The dead don't
come back to life.

316
00:16:14,983 --> 00:16:16,733
I don't disagree with you.

317
00:16:16,817 --> 00:16:20,525
But as of now, we must
consider all possibilities.

318
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:27,275
[OUGAI] This security footage
is of the Port Mafia's vault.

319
00:16:27,358 --> 00:16:29,775
It's by far the most
difficult room to enter

320
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:31,692
in our headquarters.

321
00:16:33,317 --> 00:16:35,608
Is that him?

322
00:16:35,692 --> 00:16:40,817
[BOSS] I have returned from
the smoldering pits of Hell.

323
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:44,025
Do you know why, Doctor?

324
00:16:44,108 --> 00:16:48,983
It's pure anger...
He feeds incessantly upon it.

325
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:51,900
It was he who summoned
me back from Hell

326
00:16:51,983 --> 00:16:55,442
with the intention of having
me breed even more anger.

327
00:16:55,525 --> 00:17:00,233
The beast of the gods...
Arahabaki of the black flames.

328
00:17:03,775 --> 00:17:07,983
[OUGAI] That's all the footage
we have in our security records.

329
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:10,608
Very few people know about this,

330
00:17:10,692 --> 00:17:14,150
and the ones that do
are under a gag order.

331
00:17:14,233 --> 00:17:16,483
[OSAMU] That may contain
the situation here,

332
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,567
but what if he gave that same
speech somewhere else in town?

333
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:20,942
[OUGAI]
He may have.

334
00:17:21,025 --> 00:17:24,900
And perhaps he said his
death was by assassination.

335
00:17:24,983 --> 00:17:27,358
If his supporters
were to find out,

336
00:17:27,442 --> 00:17:30,858
a third of our organization
would turn against me.

337
00:17:30,942 --> 00:17:32,442
[sighs]

338
00:17:32,525 --> 00:17:36,650
[OUGAI] Win or lose, the Port
Mafia would be finished.

339
00:17:36,733 --> 00:17:38,608
[OSAMU sighs]

340
00:17:38,692 --> 00:17:43,900
Tell me, Chuuya, how much
do you know about Arahabaki?

341
00:17:43,983 --> 00:17:46,150
I'll tell you what I've
learned about him.

342
00:17:46,233 --> 00:17:49,567
Arahabaki is a legendary
servant of the gods.

343
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:53,525
But because he is so ancient,
his true form is unclear.

344
00:17:53,608 --> 00:17:54,900
[CHUUYA]
Hmph.

345
00:17:54,983 --> 00:17:57,650
You don't actually believe
in that stuff, do you?

346
00:17:57,733 --> 00:18:01,025
[OUGAI] You entertained the
notion as well, did you not?

347
00:18:01,108 --> 00:18:03,858
You hunted down the same
rumors that we did,

348
00:18:03,942 --> 00:18:07,400
and were willing to follow them
whenever they took you.

349
00:18:07,483 --> 00:18:09,817
We get a lot of people
coming and going.

350
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,400
There's no easy way to find
the source of the rumors.

351
00:18:13,483 --> 00:18:16,567
Do you know how Suribachi
City came to be?

352
00:18:16,650 --> 00:18:18,317
There was a mysterious explosion

353
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,442
at the end of the
boss' rampage.

354
00:18:20,525 --> 00:18:22,567
It was built in the aftermath.

355
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:24,525
Word around town
is that explosion

356
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,192
was caused by Arahabaki.

357
00:18:26,275 --> 00:18:27,858
[OUGAI]
Hm?

358
00:18:27,942 --> 00:18:29,900
[CHUUYA]
Eight years ago,

359
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:33,067
they say a captured,
foreign soldier was tortured

360
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:36,692
at a military facility
in the settlement.

361
00:18:36,775 --> 00:18:40,567
His rage and hatred
summoned Arahabaki,

362
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:44,275
and a torrent of black flames
annihilated the facility,

363
00:18:44,358 --> 00:18:48,775
along with everything
and everyone in it.

364
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:51,317
That explosion led to
the creation of...

365
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,983
[OUGAI]
Suribachi City, as we know it.

366
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:56,317
What do you think of
the story, Dazai?

367
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:59,400
[OSAMU] Whoever was responsible
seems to have a special ability

368
00:18:59,483 --> 00:19:00,775
we don't know about.

369
00:19:00,858 --> 00:19:03,858
As for the video, if what
we saw is actually real,

370
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:05,608
that doesn't bode well for us.

371
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,150
[OUGAI]
So true.

372
00:19:07,233 --> 00:19:10,650
Dazai, I have an order for you.

373
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:13,358
Before the previous boss'
staunch supporters

374
00:19:13,442 --> 00:19:17,358
catch wind of that message,
find the one responsible.

375
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:18,733
Understood?

376
00:19:18,817 --> 00:19:20,608
Will I be working by myself?

377
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:22,650
It seems time may
be running out.

378
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,483
[OUGAI]
You won't be alone.

379
00:19:24,567 --> 00:19:27,192
Chuuya will be there to
assist you in your mission.

380
00:19:27,275 --> 00:19:28,025
What?!

381
00:19:28,108 --> 00:19:29,608
Absolutely not!

382
00:19:29,692 --> 00:19:32,192
Why in the world would I need
to work with that little punk?

383
00:19:32,275 --> 00:19:34,150
You wanna run that by me again?

384
00:19:34,233 --> 00:19:35,483
I'll beat the shit
outta you, kid!

385
00:19:35,567 --> 00:19:37,358
[OSAMU] Stop talking like
you're older than me!

386
00:19:37,442 --> 00:19:39,733
You're still a kid--
a very small one at that!

387
00:19:39,817 --> 00:19:40,942
[CHUUYA]
Why, you...

388
00:19:41,025 --> 00:19:41,983
[OSAMU] You really oughta
drink more milk,

389
00:19:42,067 --> 00:19:43,275
it might help you get bigger...

390
00:19:43,358 --> 00:19:45,442
[CHUUYA]
Lay off about my size, jackass!

391
00:19:45,525 --> 00:19:47,525
I'm only 15! I'm still growing!

392
00:19:47,608 --> 00:19:49,983
That's enough from both of you.

393
00:19:52,108 --> 00:19:53,775
[OUGAI]
Chuuya.

394
00:19:53,858 --> 00:19:59,192
I trust you understand you're in
no position to refuse my orders.

395
00:19:59,275 --> 00:20:01,067
You, too, Dazai.

396
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:03,942
If the boss' supporters
discover the truth,

397
00:20:04,025 --> 00:20:06,817
as my accomplice,
you will surely be tortured.

398
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,775
Death will not be swift.

399
00:20:08,858 --> 00:20:11,942
You really think pairing
us together is wise?

400
00:20:12,025 --> 00:20:14,900
I have a number of
reasons for doing so.

401
00:20:14,983 --> 00:20:17,817
Interviewing witnesses
will be far easier

402
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,567
if done by an outsider.

403
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:21,317
Chuuya also needs
to be monitored

404
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,775
in case he tries to betray us.

405
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:25,608
And the rest...

406
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:27,858
[OUGAI chuckles]

407
00:20:27,942 --> 00:20:29,567
[OUGAI]
...is a secret.

408
00:20:31,108 --> 00:20:32,692
[CHUUYA]
Hey, you wanna maybe tell me

409
00:20:32,775 --> 00:20:34,233
what's goin' on, asshole?

410
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:37,108
[OSAMU] Sorry. Would you mind
not talking to me right now?

411
00:20:37,192 --> 00:20:38,650
I'm busy breathing.

412
00:20:38,733 --> 00:20:41,525
[CHUUYA] I'm gonna rip your
head off, you suicidal maniac.

413
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:43,150
Now how 'bout you
answer my question

414
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:46,067
and tell me what we're doing!

415
00:20:46,150 --> 00:20:47,858
[OSAMU]
We're going to investigate.

416
00:20:47,942 --> 00:20:48,983
Huh?

417
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:50,358
[OSAMU]
We're interviewing people

418
00:20:50,442 --> 00:20:53,067
who were closest
to the explosion.

419
00:20:53,150 --> 00:20:54,650
[CHUUYA]
Explosion?

420
00:20:54,733 --> 00:20:57,317
[OSAMU] A week ago,
there was an explosion nearby.

421
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,775
Similar to the one we
experienced yesterday

422
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:01,150
in our battle.

423
00:21:01,233 --> 00:21:03,942
The previous boss wasn't
sighted at this incident,

424
00:21:04,025 --> 00:21:09,192
but looking at the similarities,
the cause is likely the same.

425
00:21:09,275 --> 00:21:12,483
We're going to go speak with
a survivor from that explosion.

426
00:21:12,567 --> 00:21:15,483
"Survivor" implies that
there were casualties.

427
00:21:15,567 --> 00:21:19,733
Yes. Members of the Port
Mafia--not that you care.

428
00:21:20,775 --> 00:21:23,733
This survivor we're
meeting with is gifted.

429
00:21:23,817 --> 00:21:26,192
Actually you've already
met this person.

430
00:21:26,275 --> 00:21:29,108
[explosion]

431
00:21:29,192 --> 00:21:31,067
[OSAMU]
Oh, my.

432
00:21:31,150 --> 00:21:33,900
It looks like the culprit's
already gotten to them.

433
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:36,817
Then quit gab'n
and move yer ass!

434
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,358
[sighs]

435
00:21:50,483 --> 00:21:54,233
[CHUUYA] Don't think we're
gonna score an interview here.

436
00:21:54,317 --> 00:21:56,400
[SOLDIER] Put your arms up
and slowly turn around.

437
00:21:56,483 --> 00:21:57,942
[CHUUYA]
Hm?

438
00:21:58,025 --> 00:21:59,650
Check this out.

439
00:21:59,733 --> 00:22:02,692
We didn't even have to go
hunting for our dinner.

440
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:05,692
I didn't feel like doing
an interview anyway.

441
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:08,733
I'd rather just skip all
the boring, chatty crap

442
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:12,025
and deal with the one
who's directly responsible.

443
00:22:12,108 --> 00:22:16,858
Stay back. I'm gonna enjoy this.

444
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:18,733
[OSAMU sighs]

445
00:22:18,817 --> 00:22:20,775
[OSAMU]
What a child.

446
00:23:52,317 --> 00:23:55,817
[OSAMU] Well, it was certainly
an interesting story.

447
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:57,483
I understand everything now.

448
00:23:57,567 --> 00:23:59,650
Thanks to you,
the mystery is solved.

449
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:01,900
[CHUUYA]
Then tell me who's behind it.

450
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:03,358
[OSAMU] Why don't we
have a contest to see

451
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,067
who can identify
the culprit first?

452
00:24:06,150 --> 00:24:11,108
But if I win...
you're my dog for life.

453
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:16,567
Next time on <i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> ,
Episode 27: "God of Fire."

454
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:20,317
[CHUUYA]
Fine! Bring it!
