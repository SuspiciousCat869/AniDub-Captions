1
00:00:15,858 --> 00:00:20,108
[CHUUYA] I only have memories
of one part of my life.

2
00:00:20,192 --> 00:00:24,942
Unlike you, I didn't lose
my memories from trauma.

3
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:28,400
My life only really
started eight years ago.

4
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:32,275
Before that...
everything was just...

5
00:00:32,358 --> 00:00:33,733
...darkness.

6
00:00:38,983 --> 00:00:41,150
[CHUUYA]
Somewhere in that darkness,

7
00:00:41,233 --> 00:00:43,775
I was floating aimlessly.

8
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,442
[CHUUYA]
Eventually,

9
00:00:49,525 --> 00:00:52,650
someone's hand broke through
the outer edges of that void

10
00:00:52,733 --> 00:00:55,650
and dragged me into
the outside world.

11
00:01:04,317 --> 00:01:06,858
That hand was yours, wasn't it?

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:11,025
[CHUUYA]
Where did you find me?

13
00:01:11,108 --> 00:01:15,358
To find the answer,
I decided to follow this case.

14
00:01:15,442 --> 00:01:19,233
Now, tell me everything
that you know.

15
00:01:19,317 --> 00:01:21,233
[RANDO]
Very well then.

16
00:01:21,317 --> 00:01:24,317
Of anyone, you have
the right to be told.

17
00:01:26,983 --> 00:01:28,192
[CHUUYA groans]

18
00:01:30,275 --> 00:01:32,525
Why didn't his
gravity powers work?

19
00:01:32,608 --> 00:01:35,858
[RANDO] Unlike a bullet,
the subspace I control

20
00:01:35,942 --> 00:01:38,692
doesn't abide by
the laws of physics.

21
00:01:38,775 --> 00:01:41,108
It is of another world
entirely which has been

22
00:01:41,192 --> 00:01:45,358
closed off from this one,
and I alone hold the key.

23
00:01:56,317 --> 00:01:58,317
As such...

24
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:00,900
...only if I allow
you to, may you enter.

25
00:02:00,983 --> 00:02:04,067
And only if I allow
you to, may you leave.

26
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,108
[OSAMU] You left me outside
of the subspace you deployed.

27
00:02:07,192 --> 00:02:09,525
Then you must know
what my ability is.

28
00:02:09,608 --> 00:02:11,108
[CHUUYA]
You son of a--!

29
00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:14,192
That blast didn't kill you, huh?

30
00:02:14,275 --> 00:02:16,900
Nothing less from Arahabaki.

31
00:02:16,983 --> 00:02:18,358
[CHUUYA grunts]

32
00:02:23,317 --> 00:02:26,025
Nice try, but it is of no use.

33
00:02:26,108 --> 00:02:28,983
You cannot hope to reach
me while I'm in this space,

34
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:32,692
while I, on the other hand,
can strike you at will.

35
00:02:34,858 --> 00:02:36,275
[CHUUYA yells]

36
00:02:53,025 --> 00:02:57,275
Any kind of ability that
touches that kid gets nullified.

37
00:02:57,358 --> 00:03:00,483
If you try to quarantine
him with your subspace,

38
00:03:00,567 --> 00:03:02,650
you'll make a good
opening for me.

39
00:03:02,733 --> 00:03:05,525
[RANDO] His existence
is truly heretical.

40
00:03:05,608 --> 00:03:07,817
The ultimate,
anti-gifted weapon,

41
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:10,192
unrivaled, even
back in the west.

42
00:03:10,275 --> 00:03:11,733
The west?

43
00:03:12,775 --> 00:03:14,358
But that's fine.

44
00:03:19,942 --> 00:03:21,275
[OSAMU groans]

45
00:03:24,025 --> 00:03:25,900
[BOSS chuckles]

46
00:03:28,317 --> 00:03:30,983
It's been awhile, hasn't it?

47
00:03:31,067 --> 00:03:32,233
[OSAMU]
Yeah.

48
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:35,233
You look good for
someone who's dead, Boss.

49
00:03:35,317 --> 00:03:37,858
[groans] Well...

50
00:03:37,942 --> 00:03:40,150
...former boss.

51
00:03:40,233 --> 00:03:42,442
There's no way he could
have hurt that idiot

52
00:03:42,525 --> 00:03:43,858
with his special ability.

53
00:03:43,942 --> 00:03:45,400
[OSAMU]
You're right.

54
00:03:45,483 --> 00:03:48,650
His giant scythe isn't
an ability at all.

55
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,025
It's as real as you or me.

56
00:03:52,067 --> 00:03:53,483
[CHUUYA]
I see...

57
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:56,608
So there's a possibility it
could really kill you, then.

58
00:03:57,817 --> 00:04:00,067
The former boss is dead...

59
00:04:02,567 --> 00:04:05,108
[OSAMU]
What exactly did you do, Rando?

60
00:04:05,192 --> 00:04:06,942
[RANDO]
My ability can turn corpses

61
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:08,858
that reside in my subspace

62
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:12,775
into supernatural beings
which I command.

63
00:04:12,858 --> 00:04:17,192
The only draw back is that I
can only control one at a time.

64
00:04:18,233 --> 00:04:19,983
Quite impressive.

65
00:04:20,067 --> 00:04:22,692
You've been hiding that
ability from the organization

66
00:04:22,775 --> 00:04:24,608
this whole time?

67
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:27,608
Just who are you really?

68
00:04:27,692 --> 00:04:29,483
[RANDO]
Before joining the Port Mafia,

69
00:04:29,567 --> 00:04:32,567
I was a gifted spy
from the west.

70
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:35,608
I traveled to this country
to obtain a being--

71
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,067
one of incredible power

72
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:39,442
that the government of
Japan had discovered,

73
00:04:39,525 --> 00:04:41,442
or so they say.

74
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:44,358
And that "being" was Arahabaki.

75
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:47,400
[RANDO] The sole purpose of my
plan from the very beginning

76
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:50,317
has been to kill you, Chuuya,

77
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:55,067
and then use my powers to
control you and Arahabaki

78
00:04:55,150 --> 00:04:57,858
from beyond the grave.

79
00:04:57,942 --> 00:04:59,317
Dazai.

80
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,150
If the boss were to learn
what you just have about me,

81
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:05,650
he would surely attempt
to have me assassinated.

82
00:05:05,733 --> 00:05:09,858
Because of that, you must
die here, along with Chuuya.

83
00:05:14,775 --> 00:05:15,733
[OUGAI]
It's nothing serious.

84
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:17,775
You won't be in
any kind of danger.

85
00:05:17,858 --> 00:05:19,608
No big deal.

86
00:05:21,525 --> 00:05:23,733
Danger's fine with me.

87
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:27,233
--[OSAMU] Hey.
--[CHUUYA] Hm?

88
00:05:28,317 --> 00:05:30,567
I say we kill them both.

89
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:31,942
Together.

90
00:05:32,025 --> 00:05:35,150
Huh? You mean you
actually wanna live now?

91
00:05:35,233 --> 00:05:37,525
Believe it or not,
I'm starting to actually like

92
00:05:37,608 --> 00:05:39,442
working for the Port Mafia.

93
00:05:39,525 --> 00:05:43,817
In the outside world, death is
kept away from everyday life.

94
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,442
But in the Mafia's world,

95
00:05:45,525 --> 00:05:49,900
death is an extension of, and
even a part of everyday life.

96
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,983
I personally find more truth
behind that way of thinking.

97
00:05:53,067 --> 00:05:55,525
After all, dying isn't
the opposite of living

98
00:05:55,608 --> 00:05:57,483
like the majority of
people think it is,

99
00:05:57,567 --> 00:06:00,775
but a part of the
experience of life itself.

100
00:06:00,858 --> 00:06:03,775
Without observing death
up close, one can't capture

101
00:06:03,858 --> 00:06:06,900
the full picture of
what it means to live.

102
00:06:06,983 --> 00:06:08,192
Really...

103
00:06:08,275 --> 00:06:12,025
You, the suicidal maniac,
actually wanna live.

104
00:06:12,108 --> 00:06:13,567
You serious?

105
00:06:13,650 --> 00:06:16,275
I figure it's worth
giving a shot.

106
00:06:16,358 --> 00:06:18,400
I can't promise more than that.

107
00:06:18,483 --> 00:06:20,317
You won't have to.

108
00:06:22,483 --> 00:06:24,233
Time to die, children.

109
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:25,650
Oh, really?

110
00:06:32,525 --> 00:06:33,525
[CHUUYA grunts]

111
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,025
You see it now, right?

112
00:06:38,108 --> 00:06:39,192
What you need to do?

113
00:06:39,275 --> 00:06:41,858
Don't you start
giving me orders.

114
00:06:41,942 --> 00:06:42,858
[CHUUYA grunts]

115
00:06:49,192 --> 00:06:52,858
[CHUUYA grunting]

116
00:06:52,942 --> 00:06:55,233
[RANDO]
Eight years ago...

117
00:06:55,317 --> 00:06:59,567
...I tried to take Arahabaki
as my supernatural being.

118
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:02,275
But the moment that
Arahabaki emerged,

119
00:07:02,358 --> 00:07:06,650
it decimated its surroundings
in the blink of an eye.

120
00:07:06,733 --> 00:07:10,150
I won't make the
same mistake twice.

121
00:07:10,233 --> 00:07:13,067
This time I'll make
certain to end your life,

122
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:14,900
then subsume you!

123
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:19,150
[screams]

124
00:07:22,983 --> 00:07:26,525
[RANDO laughing]

125
00:07:33,733 --> 00:07:34,983
[RANDO]
What?

126
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:36,775
You were able to
absorb the impact

127
00:07:36,858 --> 00:07:41,483
by increasing your density,
using your gravity ability?

128
00:07:41,567 --> 00:07:42,733
[CHUUYA]
Hey.

129
00:07:42,817 --> 00:07:45,067
Wanna know why I've been
keeping both my hands

130
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,233
tucked away this whole time?

131
00:07:49,525 --> 00:07:53,442
It's a simple way for
me to keep my cool.

132
00:07:53,525 --> 00:07:57,650
It helps me stay rooted when I'm
afraid I'm gonna lose myself.

133
00:08:00,525 --> 00:08:03,067
But the gloves are
coming off now.

134
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:04,650
Wonderful!

135
00:08:04,733 --> 00:08:08,400
Once I subsume you, perhaps the
coldness I feel will disappear!

136
00:08:09,442 --> 00:08:10,733
Let's go, Chuuya!

137
00:08:10,817 --> 00:08:11,650
[RANDO]
Hm?

138
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:16,983
Better move your ass, Dazai.

139
00:08:17,067 --> 00:08:18,608
You piece of shit.

140
00:08:18,692 --> 00:08:21,192
[OSAMU chuckles, grunts]

141
00:08:21,275 --> 00:08:23,900
This is the end for you!

00:08:23,983 --> 00:08:25,108
Dazai!

143
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:26,233

00:08:31,108 --> 00:08:32,525
What?!

145
00:08:32,608 --> 00:08:33,400
You ready?

146
00:08:33,483 --> 00:08:35,567
Yeah! Let's go!

147
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,400
You can't!

148
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,733
Impossible!

149
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,233
[OSAMU grunts]

150
00:08:54,942 --> 00:08:56,442
[RANDO groans]

151
00:08:58,733 --> 00:08:59,775
[CHUUYA]
It's over.

152
00:08:59,858 --> 00:09:00,650
[RANDO growls]

153
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:03,608
Not even you can escape gravity.

154
00:09:05,942 --> 00:09:07,775
[BOSS growls]

155
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:10,108
[OSAMU]
If Rando's subspace vanishes,

156
00:09:10,192 --> 00:09:13,317
naturally, so will you.

157
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:14,567
Anyway...

158
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:18,483
[yells]

159
00:09:20,983 --> 00:09:23,358
[OSAMU] I won't get another
chance to say this,

160
00:09:23,442 --> 00:09:24,858
so thank you.

161
00:09:48,983 --> 00:09:51,650
[CHUUYA] You some kinda
shitty magician now, Dazai?

162
00:09:51,733 --> 00:09:53,108
[OSAMU]
Really, Chuuya?

163
00:09:53,192 --> 00:09:56,150
Did you think I was wearing
a cast for no good reason?

164
00:09:57,858 --> 00:10:02,025
You'll tell us everything
we want now, won't you, Rando?

165
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:04,817
It was on that day,
eight years ago.

166
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:08,275
I had infiltrated this
country with my colleague.

167
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:10,900
And that is when
it all happened.

168
00:10:10,983 --> 00:10:12,483
What did?

169
00:10:12,567 --> 00:10:14,942
[RANDO] We came here in
order to steal a being

170
00:10:15,025 --> 00:10:17,650
of remarkable power
that was being housed

171
00:10:17,733 --> 00:10:20,192
in a secret military facility.

172
00:10:20,275 --> 00:10:24,692
But upon reaching our target,
before I was able to obtain it,

173
00:10:24,775 --> 00:10:28,233
my partner betrayed
both me and our country.

174
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:32,400
He and I fought over the entity,
and amidst the struggle,

175
00:10:32,483 --> 00:10:34,067
we were discovered
and apprehended

176
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,983
by the Japanese military.

177
00:10:37,067 --> 00:10:39,108
In order to escape with my life,

178
00:10:39,192 --> 00:10:43,233
I had no choice but to unleash
you, the being I had stolen,

179
00:10:43,317 --> 00:10:45,067
from your dark prison,

180
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:49,692
and I attempted to use my
ability to take control.

181
00:10:49,775 --> 00:10:51,442
But before I could react,

182
00:10:51,525 --> 00:10:54,608
you blew up the
facility in an instant.

183
00:10:54,692 --> 00:10:58,567
Their records were lost,
along with my memories.

184
00:11:05,692 --> 00:11:08,858
[RANDO]
My name isn't Rando.

185
00:11:08,942 --> 00:11:11,317
Someone I met
here simply mistook

186
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:13,900
the type of hat
I wore as a rando,

187
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,983
and that became my name.

188
00:11:16,067 --> 00:11:18,442
[OSAMU]
What happened to your partner?

189
00:11:18,525 --> 00:11:22,483
[RANDO]
I killed him with my own hands.

190
00:11:22,567 --> 00:11:23,817
Chuuya...

191
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:25,317
[CHUUYA gasps]

192
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:28,942
[RANDO] I suspect you are not
in fact Arahabaki itself,

193
00:11:29,025 --> 00:11:33,608
but a human vessel that was
chosen to keep it restrained.

194
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:35,358
You're very strong.

195
00:11:35,442 --> 00:11:37,525
Not because of Arahabaki,

196
00:11:37,608 --> 00:11:40,275
but simply your strength
as a human being.

197
00:11:40,358 --> 00:11:43,025
Sure, whatever.

198
00:11:43,108 --> 00:11:45,983
[RANDO] Regardless of what's
living inside of you,

199
00:11:46,067 --> 00:11:48,400
you'll always be yourself.

200
00:11:48,483 --> 00:11:51,067
That's solace enough, is it not?

201
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:58,400
Every human being,
every living creature...

202
00:11:58,483 --> 00:12:00,483
They go about their
lives on this Earth

203
00:12:00,567 --> 00:12:03,400
without knowing
what they truly are.

204
00:12:08,108 --> 00:12:10,067
[RANDO]
How strange...

205
00:12:11,442 --> 00:12:13,567
For the first time...

206
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:15,858
...my body feels warm.

207
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:45,483
[CHUUYA] Even in death,
you're a real pain in the ass.

208
00:12:45,567 --> 00:12:47,733
Of course, the Port
Mafia confiscated

209
00:12:47,817 --> 00:12:50,692
all the records you'd
collected on Arahabaki.

210
00:12:52,775 --> 00:12:55,025
[CHUUYA]
So I'm back to square one.

211
00:12:58,733 --> 00:13:01,983
Well... even if you were alive,

212
00:13:02,067 --> 00:13:05,692
you probably wouldn't have told
anyone about that stuff anyway.

213
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:08,900
[CHUUYA]
I'll be back.

214
00:13:16,567 --> 00:13:17,650
[CHUUYA]
Hm?

215
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,983
[SHIRASE]
There you are, Chuuya.

216
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,650
[CHUUYA]
Shirase.

217
00:13:21,733 --> 00:13:24,025
What are you doing here?

218
00:13:24,108 --> 00:13:26,733
I wanted to come an'
apologize to you.

219
00:13:26,817 --> 00:13:30,275
We did some soul-searchin'
after what happened.

220
00:13:30,358 --> 00:13:31,900
[SHIRASE sighs]
We have a good handle on

221
00:13:31,983 --> 00:13:34,442
what the Sheep's
problems are now.

222
00:13:34,525 --> 00:13:38,358
So we all talked it over and
agreed on what the solution was.

223
00:13:40,317 --> 00:13:43,317
If you decided it
together, I won't--

224
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,150
[CHUUYA]
You...

225
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:50,358
[CHUUYA groans]

226
00:13:50,442 --> 00:13:52,525
We'd wait until you
let your guard down,

227
00:13:52,608 --> 00:13:55,025
then go ahead and
move in for the kill.

228
00:13:55,108 --> 00:13:57,817
That way you wouldn't have
time to use your ability.

229
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:00,192
That makes sense, right, Chuuya?

230
00:14:00,275 --> 00:14:02,150
[CHUUYA groans]

231
00:14:02,233 --> 00:14:03,942
What are you doing?

232
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:05,900
[SHIRASE]
It's no use strugglin'.

233
00:14:05,983 --> 00:14:08,525
I rubbed rat poison
on the blade.

234
00:14:08,608 --> 00:14:12,067
You'll go numb soon and
you won't be able to move.

235
00:14:13,733 --> 00:14:16,317
It's only because
you're so damn powerful.

236
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:18,942
Otherwise we wouldn't have
had to do it this way!

237
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:24,400
All of you?!

238
00:14:24,483 --> 00:14:27,817
[SHIRASE]
This is the answer we agreed on.

239
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:30,692
We're teaming up with the GSS.

240
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:33,442
We all came to realize
the terrible truth--

241
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,400
that if you were really
gonna join the Port Mafia,

242
00:14:36,483 --> 00:14:39,317
it'd end up getting each
and every one of us killed!

243
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:43,108
I would never betray the
organization! [groans]

244
00:14:43,192 --> 00:14:45,317
[SHIRASE] The GSS doesn't
change its alliances on a whim

245
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,567
like you do.

246
00:14:46,650 --> 00:14:49,317
They can be trusted as
long as they make money.

247
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:51,317
This is the smartest
thing that we can do!

248
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:54,108
It's the best way to
wipe out the Port Mafia!

249
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:00,275
It looks like...

250
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:02,692
...I was just a fool.

251
00:15:04,442 --> 00:15:06,525
--Get 'im! Fire!
--[KIDS gasp]

252
00:15:16,692 --> 00:15:18,067
[SHIRASE]
Go find him right now!

253
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,817
He may be weakened
by the poison,

254
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,525
but it won't be
enough to kill him.

255
00:15:21,608 --> 00:15:23,650
So finish the job!

256
00:15:27,025 --> 00:15:32,442
[CHUUYA groaning]

257
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,275
Their "leader" my ass...

258
00:15:36,358 --> 00:15:39,983
All I was doing was holding
the organization back.

259
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:42,567
[OSAMU]
Hey there, Chuuya.

260
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:45,317
You look like you're in a bind.

261
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:48,275
[CHUUYA] Why are you here,
you piece of shit?

262
00:15:48,358 --> 00:15:51,650
You wanna join the
festivities and kill me, too?

263
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:53,942
[OSAMU]
Mori sent me with a message.

264
00:15:54,025 --> 00:15:56,025
He wants me to
officially invite you

265
00:15:56,108 --> 00:15:58,358
to be a member
of the Port Mafia.

266
00:15:58,442 --> 00:16:01,233
[CHUUYA] In return for
saving my life? Is that it?

267
00:16:01,317 --> 00:16:03,692
[OSAMU] Uh, I don't really
even care which you choose.

268
00:16:03,775 --> 00:16:05,692
I'm just here for the bloodbath.

269
00:16:05,775 --> 00:16:09,275
Mori is a pretty
demanding employer.

270
00:16:09,358 --> 00:16:11,275
The moment I joined
the Port Mafia,

271
00:16:11,358 --> 00:16:13,733
he put me in charge of the army.

272
00:16:13,817 --> 00:16:16,483
Now that two of our enemies,
the GSS and the Sheep,

273
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:18,400
have formed an alliance,

274
00:16:18,483 --> 00:16:20,025
we have to shut them down

275
00:16:20,108 --> 00:16:22,983
before they become
completely coordinated.

276
00:16:23,067 --> 00:16:26,775
If I do my job, by noon today...

277
00:16:26,858 --> 00:16:28,233
...they'll all be dead.

278
00:16:28,317 --> 00:16:29,317
[CHUUYA grunts]

279
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,692
You'd actually hurt those kids?

280
00:16:31,775 --> 00:16:33,983
[OSAMU]
Our policy never changes.

281
00:16:35,275 --> 00:16:39,233
That said, there is
another possibility.

282
00:16:39,317 --> 00:16:41,567
If someone who was
familiar with the enemy

283
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:43,608
asked me not to
go through with it,

284
00:16:43,692 --> 00:16:46,108
I would take that
under advisement.

285
00:16:47,025 --> 00:16:48,983
Someone on your team, you mean?

286
00:16:49,067 --> 00:16:50,067
[OSAMU]
Right.

287
00:16:50,150 --> 00:16:53,442
A fellow colleague
in the Port Mafia.

288
00:16:53,525 --> 00:16:56,233
I could trust the
suggestion of one of my own.

289
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:58,233
So you wanna make a deal.

290
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,067
You really are the devil.

291
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:02,067
Don't forget though
that I won those games

292
00:17:02,150 --> 00:17:03,775
we made bets on together.

293
00:17:03,858 --> 00:17:06,025
You'll be working for me
in this organization

294
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:09,900
and I have every intention
of working you to the bone.

295
00:17:10,817 --> 00:17:12,983
I'm gonna tear you
to shreds one day.

296
00:17:13,067 --> 00:17:15,192
[OSAMU]
I like the look in your eyes.

297
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,358
Like a wild beast.

298
00:17:18,233 --> 00:17:20,233
[CHUUYA]
Just don't kill the children.

299
00:17:20,317 --> 00:17:22,233
[OSAMU]
Very well.

300
00:17:22,317 --> 00:17:25,442
Listen up, everyone.
As we discussed earlier,

301
00:17:25,525 --> 00:17:28,317
none of the kids
are to be harmed.

302
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,275
I see.

303
00:17:31,358 --> 00:17:35,650
He knew this was gonna happen
and planned accordingly.

304
00:17:35,733 --> 00:17:39,067
It all started when he made
that phone call at the arcade!

305
00:17:39,150 --> 00:17:41,650
--[gunfire]
--[CHUUYA groans]

306
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:44,192
[CHUUYA] He purposefully did
that in front of my people

307
00:17:44,275 --> 00:17:46,150
to spread doubt.

308
00:17:47,692 --> 00:17:50,067
That damn son of a bitch.

309
00:17:50,150 --> 00:17:52,233
[CHUUYA groans]

310
00:17:52,317 --> 00:17:55,775
[CHUUYA] If that's how
you wanna play it, I'm in.

311
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,817
[CHUUYA]
What's up with this hat?

312
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,358
[OUGAI]
It's tradition in the Port Mafia

313
00:18:06,442 --> 00:18:08,483
that the person who
recruits a new member

314
00:18:08,567 --> 00:18:11,192
is responsible for
their well being.

315
00:18:11,275 --> 00:18:15,067
To symbolize that, they hand
down one of their belongings.

316
00:18:15,150 --> 00:18:17,775
In Dazai's case,
I gave him my coat.

317
00:18:17,858 --> 00:18:19,733
For you, it's that hat.

318
00:18:19,817 --> 00:18:21,608
It's seen better days.

319
00:18:21,692 --> 00:18:24,900
[OUGAI] Yes. It actually
belonged to Rando.

320
00:18:24,983 --> 00:18:26,192
Uh--

321
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,150
[OUGAI] It seems that he'd
been investigating Arahabaki.

322
00:18:34,233 --> 00:18:37,067
Apparently the military
facility he infiltrated

323
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:40,650
was researching the creation
of an artificial gifted

324
00:18:40,733 --> 00:18:43,483
by combining gifted
and ordinary humans.

325
00:18:43,567 --> 00:18:45,192
[CHUUYA]
An artificial gifted...

326
00:18:45,275 --> 00:18:47,150
[OUGAI] Those documents
there are the ones

327
00:18:47,233 --> 00:18:49,942
he collected on the subject.

328
00:18:50,025 --> 00:18:52,025
Not so fast.

329
00:18:52,108 --> 00:18:53,150
Huh?

330
00:18:53,233 --> 00:18:55,650
I regret to inform you, Chuuya,

331
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:58,983
but only executives have
clearance to look at those.

332
00:18:59,067 --> 00:19:01,567
What makes you think I won't
beat the crap out of you

333
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,233
and just take it?

334
00:19:03,317 --> 00:19:06,233
[OUGAI] I know you're
not as foolish as that.

335
00:19:07,858 --> 00:19:09,483
[OUGAI]
Besides...

336
00:19:09,567 --> 00:19:11,442
...I wouldn't be able
to answer the question

337
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,608
that's most pressing
in your mind if you did.

338
00:19:18,733 --> 00:19:22,067
It was that easy to
see through me, huh?

339
00:19:22,150 --> 00:19:23,400
Tell me, then.

340
00:19:23,483 --> 00:19:26,150
What's it mean to be the
leader of an organization?

341
00:19:26,233 --> 00:19:27,692
[OUGAI]
A leader of an organzation

342
00:19:27,775 --> 00:19:31,817
is someone who acts as both
its king and its servant.

343
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:34,775
To protect the group,
they gladly put themselves

344
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,733
through all manner of
filth and tribulation.

345
00:19:37,817 --> 00:19:40,067
They hone their
subordinates and place them

346
00:19:40,150 --> 00:19:42,025
where they are best suited.

347
00:19:42,108 --> 00:19:47,483
Otherwise, if deemed necessary,
they discard them.

348
00:19:47,567 --> 00:19:49,858
They must take on
any act of barbarism

349
00:19:49,942 --> 00:19:52,483
without hesitation.

350
00:19:52,567 --> 00:19:54,608
That is a leader.

351
00:20:00,108 --> 00:20:02,733
It's all for the
sake of the group,

352
00:20:02,817 --> 00:20:07,108
as well as for the protection
of this city we so cherish.

353
00:20:08,817 --> 00:20:10,317
[CHUUYA]
I see...

354
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,317
So that's what I was missing.

355
00:20:23,192 --> 00:20:24,858
I've made my decision.

356
00:20:24,942 --> 00:20:29,025
I'm dedicating my life
entirely to you, Boss.

357
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:32,483
I will work to see that this
organization is protected,

358
00:20:32,567 --> 00:20:35,233
and decimate those
who stand in our way.

359
00:20:35,317 --> 00:20:38,483
Our enemies will soon come
to fear the crushing weight

360
00:20:38,567 --> 00:20:41,525
that my powers of gravity
can inflict on them.

361
00:20:41,608 --> 00:20:45,108
They'll think twice
about opposing us.

362
00:20:49,817 --> 00:20:54,317
Welcome to the Port Mafia,
Chuuya Nakahara.

363
00:21:02,025 --> 00:21:03,108
[CHUUYA]
Hey, old lady.

364
00:21:03,192 --> 00:21:05,233
Why are you taking
me to this meeting?

365
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:08,150
[KOUYOU] I would appreciate it
if you stopped calling me that.

366
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:10,025
I'm not elderly yet.

367
00:21:10,108 --> 00:21:12,650
And you're going so you
can be better informed.

368
00:21:12,733 --> 00:21:14,858
The group we're
meeting with today

369
00:21:14,942 --> 00:21:17,900
is a front organization
for the Mafia.

370
00:21:17,983 --> 00:21:21,483
In the course of this meeting,
even the smallest of actions

371
00:21:21,567 --> 00:21:23,983
will affect the
Port Mafia's future.

372
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:26,525
You sure you want me in
on a thing like this?

373
00:21:26,608 --> 00:21:28,650
What if I happen to
piss 'em off or somethin'?

374
00:21:28,733 --> 00:21:31,150
[KOUYOU] We'll cross that
bridge if we need to.

375
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:33,150
If the boat is so
easily tipped over,

376
00:21:33,233 --> 00:21:35,692
the best course of action
would be to destroy it now

377
00:21:35,775 --> 00:21:37,650
in a blaze of glory.

378
00:21:38,483 --> 00:21:40,692
[KYUSAKU giggles]
Hi, I'm Kyusaku!

379
00:21:40,775 --> 00:21:42,275
Hey, you wana play a game?

380
00:21:42,358 --> 00:21:43,608
--[growls]
--Please, please?!

381
00:21:43,692 --> 00:21:46,817
[OSAMU] Now, now, maybe
a little later, all right?

382
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:47,817
Huh?!

383
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,025
[CHUUYA]
You!

384
00:21:49,108 --> 00:21:50,483
[OSAMU]
Hey!

385
00:21:50,567 --> 00:21:53,192
What do you think you're
doing here with her, Chuuya?!

386
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,317
Don't forget that you're my dog!

387
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,733
What?!

388
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:58,608
[OSAMU] That means if my
leg itches, you scratch it.

389
00:21:58,692 --> 00:22:01,442
If I want noodles, you drag
a shop owner to come here

390
00:22:01,525 --> 00:22:03,317
and make me the best
noodles in the world!

391
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,067
So what are you doing
working under Kouyou, huh?

392
00:22:06,150 --> 00:22:09,025
You think you're just gonna
glide on up the ladder?

393
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,983
You gotta pay your
dues before that!

394
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:13,942
Shut the hell up,
you selfish, scheming bastard!

395
00:22:14,025 --> 00:22:16,775
I joined the Port Mafia
on my own accord.

396
00:22:16,858 --> 00:22:19,650
Not to be your henchman,
your slave, or especially...

397
00:22:19,733 --> 00:22:21,358
Was it really a wise decision

398
00:22:21,442 --> 00:22:24,150
to have these two working
under the same roof?

399
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:26,233
What happens next?

400
00:22:26,317 --> 00:22:29,942
"Only a diamond can polish
another diamond." Heh.

401
00:22:30,025 --> 00:22:31,275
[KOUYOU]
Huh?

402
00:22:31,358 --> 00:22:33,317
Master Natsume...

403
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:37,358
Those words that you imparted
to both me and Fukuzawa...

404
00:22:37,442 --> 00:22:38,983
I'm going to find
out for certain

405
00:22:39,067 --> 00:22:41,400
if you were right or not.

406
00:22:51,067 --> 00:22:53,275
[ANGO] This concludes the
summary of events surrounding

407
00:22:53,358 --> 00:22:55,525
the recruitment of
Port Mafia executives

408
00:22:55,608 --> 00:22:59,483
Chuuya Nakahara and Osamu Dazai.

409
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,650
The Port Mafia's
influence soon spread

410
00:23:01,733 --> 00:23:04,817
significantly under
Mori's new leadership.

411
00:23:06,608 --> 00:23:08,483
[ANGO]
Another year later,

412
00:23:08,567 --> 00:23:12,150
Chuuya Nakahara discovered
the truth of his own origins,

413
00:23:12,233 --> 00:23:14,275
and went to confront
the gifted spy

414
00:23:14,358 --> 00:23:18,192
who had befriended and
then betrayed Rando.

415
00:23:18,275 --> 00:23:22,108
It turns out he wasn't dead.

416
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,317
I will provide a separate
report on that matter.

417
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:28,442

Gifted Special
Operations Division

422
00:23:37,858 --> 00:23:41,275
Assistant Counselor,
Ango Sakaguchi.

423
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,817
[FYODOR D.] I've never done
anything bad before.

424
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,067
I've never cried before.

425
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,483
No one in the world
is kinder than I am.

426
00:24:00,567 --> 00:24:05,275
My ability allows me to control
space and consciousness.

427
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:09,400
Now... how many lies
did I just tell?

428
00:24:09,483 --> 00:24:13,275
Next time on
<i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> , Episode 29:

429

"My Ill Deeds Are
the Work of God."

430
00:24:16,483 --> 00:24:19,275
May you be freed from the
shackles of your crimes,

431
00:24:19,358 --> 00:24:21,400
and your soul be salvaged.
