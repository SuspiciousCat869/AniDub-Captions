00:00:19,483 --> 00:00:21,358
[ATSUSHI]
I just received a message.

2
00:00:21,442 --> 00:00:24,775
It said, "Do not fight
the Port Mafia."

3
00:00:24,858 --> 00:00:26,942
Our president gave that
order from his deathbed,

4
00:00:27,025 --> 00:00:28,483
so shouldn't we
forget about fighting

5
00:00:28,567 --> 00:00:31,150
and find a way to capture
whoever controls the virus?

6
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,650
Yes, but we've already
attempted that.

7
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,567
The enemy is a crafty one.

8
00:00:35,650 --> 00:00:37,025
It'll be impossible to uproot

9
00:00:37,108 --> 00:00:40,650
all of its meticulously
prepared traps in time.

10
00:00:40,733 --> 00:00:42,108
Even for you, Rampo?

11
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:44,233
That's precisely
what I'm saying.

12
00:00:44,317 --> 00:00:48,233
Regardless, to fight is
a violation of our orders.

13
00:00:48,317 --> 00:00:49,525
And?

14
00:00:49,608 --> 00:00:50,900
[RAMPO]
Each of you to need to decide

15
00:00:50,983 --> 00:00:53,817
what action you will take.

16
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:56,608
Rampo, are you
asking us to choose

17
00:00:56,692 --> 00:01:00,608
between obeying the president
or fighting the Mafia?

18
00:01:00,692 --> 00:01:01,858
[RAMPO]
That's right.

19
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:04,567
But we don't have much
time to mull it over.

20
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,692
If the Port Mafia finds
out our president

21
00:01:06,775 --> 00:01:11,150
is in a protected ability space,
they'll switch tactics.

22
00:01:11,233 --> 00:01:13,692
Our friends and family--
anyone important to us--

23
00:01:13,775 --> 00:01:16,192
might be taken hostage.

24
00:01:16,275 --> 00:01:17,983
They might even be killed.

25
00:01:18,067 --> 00:01:20,233
Unless we give
them the president.

26
00:01:20,317 --> 00:01:22,067
Even the Agency
may have no choice

27
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,358
but to buckle to such threats.

28
00:01:27,317 --> 00:01:28,817
[HIROTSU]
The only path open to us

29
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:32,817
is soaked with blood and
littered with human entrails.

30
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:36,483
It's a path the Mafia is
accustomed to traveling.

31
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,400
[JUNICHIROU]
I'll do it. I'll fight.

32
00:01:41,483 --> 00:01:42,900
Let's face it.

33
00:01:42,983 --> 00:01:44,567
We usually have to hurt somebody

34
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,733
in order to protect
somebody else.

35
00:01:46,817 --> 00:01:48,567
I'll go along as well.

36
00:01:48,650 --> 00:01:52,233
Let's just say I have a bit
of a bone to pick with Mori.

37
00:01:52,317 --> 00:01:54,817
I'm sure he would find
a certain poetic beauty

38
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:57,108
to such an ending.

39
00:01:57,192 --> 00:01:59,067
[KYOUKA]
I'm afraid of him.

40
00:02:00,817 --> 00:02:03,150
[KYOUKA] But if my knowledge of
the Port Mafia can be useful

41
00:02:03,233 --> 00:02:07,150
to everyone here,
then I should go, as well.

42
00:02:07,233 --> 00:02:08,942
You sure, Kyouka?

43
00:02:09,025 --> 00:02:11,483
[KENJI] Whether what we're
doing is right or wrong,

44
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:13,400
I have no idea.

45
00:02:13,483 --> 00:02:16,608
But still, if our people
walk into trouble,

46
00:02:16,692 --> 00:02:19,900
they'll need help,
so I'll go with them.

47
00:02:19,983 --> 00:02:22,233
Kenji, I...

48
00:02:22,317 --> 00:02:25,400
Kunikida, what about you?

49
00:02:25,483 --> 00:02:27,108
We have our orders.

50
00:02:27,192 --> 00:02:31,483
The president wants us to keep
this city safe and stable.

51
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,108
To protect the
citizens from Fyodor,

52
00:02:34,192 --> 00:02:37,025
who wants to destroy
everything in Yokohoma.

53
00:02:37,108 --> 00:02:41,025
So then, do you intend to
try to find the gifted?

54
00:02:41,108 --> 00:02:42,442
[DOPPO]
No.

55
00:02:42,525 --> 00:02:47,025
If I attempt that,
more innocent people will die!

56
00:02:47,108 --> 00:02:48,942
Like that little girl.

57
00:02:49,025 --> 00:02:52,525
If another death like that
happens before my eyes...

58
00:02:52,608 --> 00:02:54,817
...how do I live with myself?

59
00:02:58,025 --> 00:03:00,192
[RAMPO]
Kunikida, you are the strongest

60
00:03:00,275 --> 00:03:04,025
and most virtuous
of us in the Agency.

61
00:03:04,108 --> 00:03:07,358
That's why the enemy tried
to break you down first.

62
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:11,067
Don't ever forget that.

63
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:58,733
[ATSUSHI] We can't get into
a fight with the Port Mafia.

64
00:04:58,817 --> 00:05:02,733
We'll be playing right into
the mastermind's hands.

65
00:05:02,817 --> 00:05:06,442
But it's not like the others
don't already know that.

66
00:05:06,525 --> 00:05:09,608
[RAMPO]
Atsushi, you coming?

67
00:05:09,692 --> 00:05:11,442
Or maybe you have a plan for us

68
00:05:11,525 --> 00:05:13,442
to go after the
mastermind instead.

69
00:05:13,525 --> 00:05:14,608
Is that it?

70
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:19,192
Well, I-I... I'm still
figuring that out.

71
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,233
Thought so. You contacted Katai.

72
00:05:24,317 --> 00:05:27,775
Didn't you ask him to look into
the Rats in the House of Dead?

73
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:33,567
[RAMPO] That investigation
has been ongoing, right?

74
00:05:35,025 --> 00:05:36,942
[RAMPO] There's a very
slim chance that Katai

75
00:05:37,025 --> 00:05:39,858
managed to find the
mastermind's location.

76
00:05:41,192 --> 00:05:43,983
Go find out if he has.

77
00:05:44,067 --> 00:05:45,358
Got it.

where the boss is sleeping.

00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,692
[PORT MAFIA GUARDS gasping]

161
00:11:09,775 --> 00:11:10,817
[PORT MAFIA GUARD gasps]

162
00:11:20,525 --> 00:11:22,983
[POE] I was so eager to write
a good mystery novel

163
00:11:23,067 --> 00:11:24,900
for his little game.

164
00:11:24,983 --> 00:11:28,317
I'm afraid Rampo really
took advantage of me.

165
00:11:29,775 --> 00:11:31,233
[POE]
This elaborate tale of massacre

166
00:11:31,317 --> 00:11:33,275
will take a top
agent like Chuuya,

167
00:11:33,358 --> 00:11:37,317
and even dear Rampo,
several days to escape from.

168
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:40,067
Or maybe both of
them will perish,

169
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:43,400
and I alone will stand in
the spotlight of victory!

170
00:11:43,483 --> 00:11:47,567
[laughing]

171
00:11:47,650 --> 00:11:49,525
Oh.

172
00:11:49,608 --> 00:11:53,067
If Rampo really were to
die in that world though,

173
00:11:53,150 --> 00:11:55,650
what would I do with myself?

174
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:04,358
Not good enough!

175
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,150
[AKUTAGAWA] You're an
assassin who specializes

176
00:12:11,233 --> 00:12:13,400
in black ops and ambushes.

177
00:12:13,483 --> 00:12:17,483
You can't win when you challenge
a stronger opponent head on.

178
00:12:17,567 --> 00:12:20,067
I'm not convinced being
with the Detective Agency

179
00:12:20,150 --> 00:12:23,275
is the right path for you.

180
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,275
You're wrong about that.

181
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,942
You don't know who I am anymore.

182
00:12:31,983 --> 00:12:35,608
[AKUTAGAWA] She dematerialized
and escaped my bonds.

183
00:12:35,692 --> 00:12:38,483
I can't even touch her
with physical attacks.

184
00:12:39,733 --> 00:12:41,358
Very well...

185
00:12:41,442 --> 00:12:43,442
Devoured Space!

186
00:12:44,817 --> 00:12:47,483
[KYOUKA] You used to tell me
I had one purpose in life--

187
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:48,983
to kill people.

188
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:51,442
[AKUTAGAWA]
It was a decoy!

189
00:12:51,525 --> 00:12:52,983
[KYOUKA]
Goodbye.

190
00:13:13,733 --> 00:13:16,650
[YUKICHI] To be knocked down
by such a crude ability...

191
00:13:16,733 --> 00:13:18,150
[static]

192
00:13:18,233 --> 00:13:19,692
[AKIKO]
We're under fire,

193
00:13:19,775 --> 00:13:22,150
pinned down like a
butterfly to a board.

194
00:13:22,233 --> 00:13:25,150
Ugh. How are things
over there, Atsushi?

195
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:27,150
[ATSUSHI]
No leads so far.

196
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:31,358
[ATSUSHI]
Also...

197
00:13:31,442 --> 00:13:34,025
...Katai's been eliminated.

198
00:13:34,108 --> 00:13:35,442
[AKIKO]
Katai?

199
00:13:40,567 --> 00:13:45,275
[AKIKO] Tell Kunikida that even
more people are about to die.

200
00:13:45,358 --> 00:13:48,067
As hard as it'll be, he can't
afford to mourn for him

201
00:13:48,150 --> 00:13:49,692
until after we've won.

202
00:13:49,775 --> 00:13:52,483
At this rate,
we might be next to go.

203
00:13:54,025 --> 00:13:54,858
[ALL]
Huh?

204
00:13:54,942 --> 00:13:57,025
Why'd they stop firing?

205
00:14:04,025 --> 00:14:06,608
What in the blazing
hell is that?

206
00:14:14,108 --> 00:14:15,817
[chuckles]

207
00:14:19,733 --> 00:14:24,692
[grunting]

208
00:14:27,525 --> 00:14:29,108
[KYOUKA]
Demonic Armor.

209
00:14:29,192 --> 00:14:31,400
I can't free my blade!

210
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,525
[AKUTAGAWA] You really
have changed, Kyouka.

211
00:14:42,608 --> 00:14:45,317
Your eyes, they're
not the same ones

212
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,525
as when I last knew you.

213
00:14:48,733 --> 00:14:50,025
[KYOUKA]
Tell me.

214
00:14:50,108 --> 00:14:53,983
Are you the gifted
who can cut anything?

215
00:14:54,067 --> 00:14:56,317
And what if I am?

216
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,650
[KYOUKA]
Cut down Demon Snow.

217
00:14:58,733 --> 00:15:02,150
Avenge my parents.

218
00:15:02,233 --> 00:15:07,692
And then, after you take down
Demon Snow... its master.

219
00:15:08,775 --> 00:15:10,858
[KYOUKA]
Kill me.

220
00:15:11,983 --> 00:15:13,275
[AKUTAGAWA]
Your eyes were filled

221
00:15:13,358 --> 00:15:16,192
with vengeance and self-hatred.

222
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:19,817
They reflected no value
in your own life.

223
00:15:20,942 --> 00:15:24,358
How would you be able to
know something like that?

224
00:15:24,442 --> 00:15:28,275
Because I once knew a man
who had the same eyes as yours.

225
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:36,317
[KYOUKA]
What happened to him?

226
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:38,817
[AKUTAGAWA] The same thing
that happened to you.

227
00:15:38,900 --> 00:15:40,650
He joined up with
a certain someone,

228
00:15:40,733 --> 00:15:44,358
and that person helped calm
his desire for death.

229
00:15:46,067 --> 00:15:49,317
[AKUTAGAWA]
Kyouka, I'm happy for you.

230
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,650
[gasps]

231
00:15:52,858 --> 00:15:54,858
[ICHIYOU] Sir, you need
to retreat for now.

232
00:15:54,942 --> 00:15:57,025
The Lemon Runway is coming!

233
00:16:05,108 --> 00:16:07,525
[ICHIYOU]
Sir, are you there?

234
00:16:07,608 --> 00:16:09,192
[AKUTAGAWA]
I hear you.

235
00:16:12,275 --> 00:16:15,733
[laughing]

236
00:16:15,817 --> 00:16:18,442
[MOTOJIROU] It took me three
days and nights to develop this!

237
00:16:18,525 --> 00:16:21,358
I was so exhausted,
I forgot to put on underwear!

238
00:16:21,442 --> 00:16:23,733
Now is the time for
us to rush the door.

239
00:16:23,817 --> 00:16:26,150
Hold it. Something's
not right here.

240
00:16:26,233 --> 00:16:27,650
Now then,

241
00:16:27,733 --> 00:16:30,900
please allow me to introduce
today's science experiment!

242
00:16:30,983 --> 00:16:35,025
I've named this one
"Watching Fireworks Up-Close"!

243
00:16:36,358 --> 00:16:38,608
Don't tell me those are
all filled with...

244
00:16:38,692 --> 00:16:41,442
Everyone, we need
to get outside, now.

245
00:16:41,525 --> 00:16:43,233
--[JUNICHIROU] Why?
--Just do it!

246
00:16:50,692 --> 00:16:52,150
[MOTOJIROU laughs]

247
00:16:52,233 --> 00:16:54,775
[MOTOJIROU] I like to think of
this as "The Lemon Runway"!

248
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:59,525
My path in life is filled with
nothing but pure explosions!

249
00:17:03,942 --> 00:17:05,150
[AKIKO]
Go near him

250
00:17:05,233 --> 00:17:06,983
and you'll be blown
into so many pieces

251
00:17:07,067 --> 00:17:10,150
even I won't be able to help.

252
00:17:10,233 --> 00:17:12,650
[MOTOJIROU] This world has
always been an empty vessel.

253
00:17:12,733 --> 00:17:16,275
Even happiness is but a simple
signal firing off in the brain.

254
00:17:16,358 --> 00:17:18,942
Hence, the only way to discover
the true meaning of life

255
00:17:19,025 --> 00:17:23,108
is to use science to dance
and play with reality!

256
00:17:23,192 --> 00:17:25,067
I won't allow anyone
to kill the master

257
00:17:25,150 --> 00:17:27,608
who makes my own
playtime possible!

258
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:30,692
I'll protect rule of the
universe to the end!

259
00:17:30,775 --> 00:17:33,067
[MOTOJIROU laughs]

260
00:17:35,858 --> 00:17:39,233
[AKIKO] Let's go.
This is a full retreat.

261
00:18:00,358 --> 00:18:02,650
[LUCY]
I won't stop you.

262
00:18:02,733 --> 00:18:05,900
I'm not technically
an Agency member.

263
00:18:05,983 --> 00:18:08,400
Even so, as someone
who took care of you

264
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:10,025
when you were ill,

265
00:18:10,108 --> 00:18:12,983
you could at least tell me
where you're going.

266
00:18:15,025 --> 00:18:17,733
I'm meeting with an old friend.

267
00:18:20,567 --> 00:18:23,358
[AKIKO] As long as that
idiot bomber is out there,

268
00:18:23,442 --> 00:18:26,608
we're not gonna be able to
get close to their building.

269
00:18:28,025 --> 00:18:31,358
[phone ringing]

270
00:18:31,442 --> 00:18:33,692
[AKIKO]
What's the matter?

271
00:18:33,775 --> 00:18:35,692
What did you say?!

272
00:18:35,775 --> 00:18:38,483
The president's disappeared?

273
00:18:38,567 --> 00:18:41,692
Stand down from your
battle stations!

274
00:18:41,775 --> 00:18:44,608
The boss has vanished
from his bed.

275
00:18:46,067 --> 00:18:49,317
[HIROTSU] Missing from a
contained, underground room.

276
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:52,817
I'm baffled. Perhaps we
should call a detective.

277
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,358
[ICHIYOU]
Sir.

278
00:18:54,442 --> 00:18:56,900
[HIROTSU]
That was a joke.

279
00:18:56,983 --> 00:19:01,650
We received word of a sighting
from the guards outside.

280
00:19:01,733 --> 00:19:05,733
It seems the boss left
of his own free will.

281
00:19:05,817 --> 00:19:07,483
He just left?

282
00:19:07,567 --> 00:19:09,525
Where would he have gone
at a time like this,

283
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,483
knowing the Agency's after him?

284
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:13,733
I don't know.

285
00:19:13,817 --> 00:19:17,858
But yet, I can think of
a reason that he left.

286
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:22,608
[HIROTSU]
He's trying to protect us.

287
00:19:26,567 --> 00:19:27,858
[NAOMI]
Haruno?

288
00:19:27,942 --> 00:19:31,650
[KIRAKO] Mii hasn't been home
for over two days now.

289
00:19:31,733 --> 00:19:33,067
I'm gonna go look for him.

290
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:34,775
[NAOMI]
You can't!

291
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:36,858
It's dangerous out there.

292
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:41,275
Yeah, but the thing with Mii is,
when he doesn't come home,

293
00:19:41,358 --> 00:19:44,358
something bad always
ends up happening.

294
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:48,067
The bombing attempt on the
police, and before that,

295
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:50,650
the illegal military activities.

296
00:19:50,733 --> 00:19:52,317
I'm sacred if I don't
bring him back,

297
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,108
something awful will
happen to the president.

298
00:19:55,192 --> 00:19:57,442
I'm sure Mii can
take care of himself.

299
00:19:57,525 --> 00:20:00,358
It's you that I'm
really worried about.

300
00:20:00,442 --> 00:20:02,442
The president.

301
00:20:02,525 --> 00:20:05,608
Even though... Even
though he was bed-ridden,

302
00:20:05,692 --> 00:20:09,900
he ignored his illness and
went out on his own to save us.

303
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:12,733
[OSAMU]
Any update on where

304
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:15,900
the president's gone,
Junichirou?

305
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:17,358
I'm afraid not.

306
00:20:17,442 --> 00:20:19,692
We've got everyone we can
muster looking for him,

307
00:20:19,775 --> 00:20:22,567
but we still haven't
found anything out.

308
00:20:22,650 --> 00:20:24,358
[OSAMU]
That figures.

309
00:20:24,442 --> 00:20:29,400
The president would've gone
someplace no one could find him.

310
00:20:29,483 --> 00:20:31,567
If there's anybody who
knows where he is,

311
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:35,817
it'd be someone he has
a strong connection with.

312
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:37,567
But who is it?

313
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:40,192
And what'll they
do now, I wonder?

314
00:20:40,275 --> 00:20:43,150
Who is who?

315
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:44,942
Hey, isn't that...?

316
00:20:45,025 --> 00:20:48,608
That's Haruno's cat.
What's it doing here?

317
00:21:08,608 --> 00:21:11,317
[OUGAI]
This place brings back memories.

318
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:12,692
[YUKICHI]
Indeed.

319
00:21:12,775 --> 00:21:15,358
We were fated to meet here.

320
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:18,192
A place none of our
people know about.

321
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:21,150
We never even had
to plan for it.

322
00:21:21,233 --> 00:21:23,525
It was inevitable.

323
00:21:23,608 --> 00:21:27,275
I also had faith that you
would come to this place.

324
00:21:27,358 --> 00:21:29,650
[YUKICHI]
Have you brought backup?

325
00:21:29,733 --> 00:21:33,233
If I had, it would only
have incited another war

326
00:21:33,317 --> 00:21:35,317
between our organizations.

327
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,858
[YUKICHI]
There's only one way to avoid

328
00:21:36,942 --> 00:21:38,858
such needless bloodshed.

329
00:21:38,942 --> 00:21:43,067
The two of us will duel,
one-on-one, to the death,

330
00:21:43,150 --> 00:21:45,233
thus stopping the cannibalism.

331
00:21:45,317 --> 00:21:48,900
[OUGAI] We both have so much
more to protect now, don't we?

332
00:21:48,983 --> 00:21:53,025
[YUKICHI] It has been ten years
since last we fought each other.

333
00:21:53,108 --> 00:21:54,608
[OUGAI]
Indeed.

334
00:21:55,942 --> 00:21:59,692
Sadly for you, this place
will become your grave.

335
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:05,983
[OUGAI]
Vita Sexualis.

336
00:22:16,192 --> 00:22:17,358
Come!

337
00:23:52,275 --> 00:23:55,650
[YUKICHI] Your ability
is as vile as ever, Mori.

338
00:23:55,733 --> 00:23:57,233
[OUGAI]
You draw the sword so deftly

339
00:23:57,317 --> 00:23:59,067
that you don't even see it.

340
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:01,608
I'd expect no less
of the Silver Wolf,

341
00:24:01,692 --> 00:24:03,858
once a sword-wielding assassin.

342
00:24:03,942 --> 00:24:08,275
Fukuzawa, there's something I'd
like to tell you before we die.

343
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:12,150
[YUKICHI] Next time on
<i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> , Episode 36:

344
00:24:12,233 --> 00:24:15,067
"Cannibalism, Part 3."

345
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:17,275
[OUGAI]
Now, my dear Elise,

346
00:24:17,358 --> 00:24:20,442
make sure that he
gets his shots.
