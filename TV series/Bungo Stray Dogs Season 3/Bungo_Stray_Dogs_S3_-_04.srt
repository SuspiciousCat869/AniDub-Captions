1
00:00:14,067 --> 00:00:16,025
[KARMA] It's not as
though I'm unaware.

2
00:00:16,108 --> 00:00:18,983
I just have terrible luck.

3
00:00:19,067 --> 00:00:20,942
What an awful life.

4
00:00:30,483 --> 00:00:33,150
So is this... really him?

5
00:00:33,233 --> 00:00:34,775
[ABDUCTOR]
Yup.

6
00:00:34,858 --> 00:00:37,858
That's the monster you
asked for right there.

7
00:00:37,942 --> 00:00:40,275
[KARMA]
Your payment, as promised.

8
00:00:43,067 --> 00:00:46,358
[ABDUCTOR] Shoulda asked
for a lot more, considering.

9
00:00:46,442 --> 00:00:49,067
Watch yourself.

10
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,567
He'll trick your soul
right outta yer body.

11
00:00:52,650 --> 00:00:55,858
His ability's dangerous,
to say the least.

12
00:01:01,942 --> 00:01:03,025
[gasps]

13
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,733
Fyodor?

14
00:02:55,817 --> 00:02:57,067
[ACE]
Yes.

15
00:02:57,150 --> 00:02:59,942
The one behind the destruction
of the Moby Dick.

16
00:03:00,025 --> 00:03:02,900
I hired a bounty hunter
to capture him.

17
00:03:02,983 --> 00:03:04,275
He leads a group of thieves

18
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,067
called the Rats in
the House of the Dead.

19
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,317
And he was also part of
the Shibusawa incident.

20
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,775
To me, he's no better than
the lowliest sewer rat.

21
00:03:14,858 --> 00:03:16,067
[KOUYOU chuckles]

22
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:19,025
[OUGAI]
Describe him to me.

23
00:03:19,108 --> 00:03:24,942
[ACE] I would have to say he
is soulless... like a vampire.

24
00:03:25,942 --> 00:03:29,525
Actually, he's just in charge
of some arctic mice.

25
00:03:29,608 --> 00:03:32,233
Using my organization's
finances, capturing him

26
00:03:32,317 --> 00:03:35,525
was easier than taking money
from a casino dealer.

27
00:03:35,608 --> 00:03:36,817
[KOUYOU chuckles]

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:41,108
Your organization? Really?

29
00:03:41,192 --> 00:03:44,733
[OUGAI] In any case, now we
have him in our custody.

30
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:47,775
And he knows how viciously
the Port Mafia retaliates.

31
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:51,108
[KOUYOU] Shall we leave things
to our team of interrogators?

32
00:03:51,192 --> 00:03:53,150
--[ACE] If I may.
--[KOUYOU] Hmm?

33
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:57,692
Instead of them, allow me to
be the one to question him.

34
00:03:57,775 --> 00:03:58,900
Really?

35
00:03:58,983 --> 00:04:01,567
Well, aren't you
excited to work today?

36
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:03,108
Surprising from the executive

37
00:04:03,192 --> 00:04:05,317
who's the first to
run from trouble.

38
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,817
That makes me more qualified
than the executives

39
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:11,150
who were captured by the enemy.

40
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,942
What matters is this man
betrayed the Guild.

41
00:04:14,025 --> 00:04:16,317
We'll need to be prepared.

42
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,150
I already have a plan in mind.

43
00:04:20,733 --> 00:04:22,858
You were the one
who caught the rat.

44
00:04:22,942 --> 00:04:24,608
Do with him as you will.

45
00:04:24,692 --> 00:04:28,275
[ACE]
Thank you for the honor, sir.

46
00:04:28,358 --> 00:04:30,275
If you'll excuse me.

47
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,983
[KOUYOU]
Are you sure about this?

48
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:38,400
He's a gambler who made an awful
mess of the Port Mafia's casino.

49
00:04:38,483 --> 00:04:41,358
The only thing he has
any loyalty to is himself.

50
00:04:41,442 --> 00:04:43,608
He only became one
of the five executives

51
00:04:43,692 --> 00:04:45,400
because he bought his position.

52
00:04:45,483 --> 00:04:47,400
As far as he's concerned,
we're all nothing

53
00:04:47,483 --> 00:04:49,900
but his glorified
personal bodyguards.

54
00:04:49,983 --> 00:04:51,358
You are correct.

55
00:04:51,442 --> 00:04:54,317
But an aptitude for
money is a strength.

56
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,858
Let's wait and see exactly
what he's capable of.

57
00:05:06,067 --> 00:05:09,358
[FYODOR D. chuckling]

58
00:05:09,442 --> 00:05:10,692
[ACE]
Open it.

59
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:19,067
Give me the knife.

60
00:05:19,150 --> 00:05:21,608
Hello. Nice to meet you.

61
00:05:21,692 --> 00:05:23,025
[FYODOR D.]
Hm.

62
00:05:23,108 --> 00:05:24,733
[chuckles]

63
00:05:25,817 --> 00:05:27,150
[yells]

64
00:05:32,275 --> 00:05:35,775
How can you philistines lock up
our guest in a place like this?!

65
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:38,483
Get him clothes and something
to drink immediately!

66
00:05:38,567 --> 00:05:41,275
Don't stand around, get to it!

67
00:05:41,358 --> 00:05:44,317
Halfwits! Each and
every one of you!

68
00:05:55,525 --> 00:05:58,858
[ACE]
I happen to be a lonely man.

69
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,733
The Port Mafia doesn't trust me.

70
00:06:01,817 --> 00:06:06,483
Though to be fair, I don't
trust any of them, either.

71
00:06:06,567 --> 00:06:09,733
The only things in this world
I put my faith in are poker,

72
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:15,108
the gems I keep in my vault,
and the 50 men under my command.

73
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,733
[ACE]
Diamond straight flush.

74
00:06:20,817 --> 00:06:23,067
It appears I've won.

75
00:06:25,192 --> 00:06:28,983
[ACE] I may have found
my 51st recruit today.

76
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:32,650
What do you say? Care to
join me on my mission?

77
00:06:34,317 --> 00:06:37,733
The two of us can team up and
get rid of Ougai for good.

78
00:06:37,817 --> 00:06:40,358
That small-town doctor
won't suspect for a minute

79
00:06:40,442 --> 00:06:42,608
that you and I have
joined forces.

80
00:06:42,692 --> 00:06:45,108
A man who's able to
outwit the Guild

81
00:06:45,192 --> 00:06:47,150
is worthy of commendation.

82
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:50,150
However, if I were to refuse,

83
00:06:50,233 --> 00:06:53,525
I'm assuming I'd never see
the light of day again.

84
00:06:53,608 --> 00:06:55,567
Do I have that about right?

85
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:57,275
Precisely.

86
00:07:00,858 --> 00:07:03,358
[FYODOR D.]
It seems I cannot refuse.

87
00:07:03,442 --> 00:07:06,900
I'm locked in an inescapable
underground room.

88
00:07:06,983 --> 00:07:08,025
And as you can see,

89
00:07:08,108 --> 00:07:10,650
I'm not exactly in
the best of health.

90
00:07:10,733 --> 00:07:13,650
So how about this?

91
00:07:13,733 --> 00:07:16,108
I will simply kill you instead.

[ACE gasps]

93
00:07:21,525 --> 00:07:25,067
Your answer
disappoints me, Fyodor.

94
00:07:26,608 --> 00:07:28,108
[ACE]
Fine then.

95
00:07:28,192 --> 00:07:31,275
It seems I need to
show you your place.

00:07:32,358 --> 00:07:34,275
[BOTH gasp]

[choking]

98
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:43,483
[ACE]
This is my gift:

99
00:07:43,567 --> 00:07:46,233
Exchanging my subordinates'
remaining lifespan

100
00:07:46,317 --> 00:07:49,067
for gems of equal value.

101
00:07:49,150 --> 00:07:53,233
Even worthless lives can be
turned into something valuable.

102
00:07:53,317 --> 00:07:55,692
It's a merciful ability indeed.

103
00:07:55,775 --> 00:07:59,233
The collar is a symbol
of one's servitude to me.

104
00:07:59,317 --> 00:08:02,275
It can't be put on
without permission.

105
00:08:02,358 --> 00:08:06,900
And once it's put on,
it can never be removed.

106
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,942
[ACE] If you decide to put on
the collar by the time I return,

107
00:08:17,025 --> 00:08:19,025
I'll allow you to live.

108
00:08:19,108 --> 00:08:20,858
Don't worry, Fyodor.

109
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:24,317
I have no doubt it'll
look good on you.

110
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,067
[door closes]

111
00:08:37,233 --> 00:08:39,567
[KARMA]
You should really just give in.

112
00:08:40,817 --> 00:08:42,650
You can't win against Ace.

113
00:08:42,733 --> 00:08:45,983
The only way to survive is
by agreeing to put this on.

114
00:08:46,067 --> 00:08:48,525
Leaving this room is impossible.

115
00:08:48,608 --> 00:08:52,067
Ace is the only one with
the key to open the door.

116
00:08:52,150 --> 00:08:53,900
That's just how it is.

117
00:08:53,983 --> 00:08:56,192
Even we can't enter
or leave this cell

118
00:08:56,275 --> 00:08:58,108
without his permission.

119
00:09:01,775 --> 00:09:05,733
[KARMA] Earlier, when you
were talking to Ace,

120
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:08,775
you said were gonna
kill him, right?

121
00:09:08,858 --> 00:09:11,025
Gotta say, I'm impressed.

122
00:09:11,108 --> 00:09:14,692
I wish I could stand up to
him like that, but I can't.

123
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:18,817
He'd trade my life for
gems in a split second.

124
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,275
Ya know, it was my dream

125
00:09:21,358 --> 00:09:24,525
to become the boss of
the Port Mafia someday.

126
00:09:25,775 --> 00:09:29,192
[KARMA] I wanted to try my
hand at running this city.

127
00:09:29,275 --> 00:09:30,525
Look at me now.

128
00:09:30,608 --> 00:09:33,650
I'm nothing more than
one of his underlings.

129
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:36,650
I was sold to a slave
dealer as a child,

130
00:09:36,733 --> 00:09:40,067
and eventually ended up here.

131
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:42,817
I used to fantasize about
someone coming to free me

132
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,775
from this thing.

133
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:48,192
But it was just a
silly pipe dream.

134
00:09:48,275 --> 00:09:50,817
I just had to accept it.

135
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:54,733
No one would ever wanna come
and save a villain like me.

136

What are you doin'?

137
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:01,025
It seems that I cut my finger
on a shard of glass earlier.

138
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:02,483
[KARMA sighs]

139
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,942
You weren't even listening
to a thing I said, were you?

140
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:08,983
Aren't you... scared at all?

141
00:10:09,067 --> 00:10:13,192
Course not. This room might
as well be my own bedroom.

142
00:10:14,733 --> 00:10:17,317
Let me tell you
about my ability.

143
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:20,942
It allows me to control
space and consciousness.

144
00:10:25,608 --> 00:10:26,900
[FYODOR D.]
Well?

145
00:10:26,983 --> 00:10:28,233
A game.

146
00:10:28,317 --> 00:10:30,942
Your wish is to have
me join your group.

147
00:10:31,025 --> 00:10:33,567
But if you can't get
me to agree to that,

148
00:10:33,650 --> 00:10:36,233
you'll still need me to
tell you about my finances,

149
00:10:36,317 --> 00:10:39,525
whom I work with,
and what my plans are.

150
00:10:39,608 --> 00:10:41,608
Therefore, you're
not in a position

151
00:10:41,692 --> 00:10:43,900
to get rid of me just yet.

152
00:10:43,983 --> 00:10:45,317
[ACE]
He's right.

153
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:46,775
I need to get
information out of him

154
00:10:46,858 --> 00:10:49,942
if I'm going to stamp
out the other rats.

155
00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:52,442
It'll also be difficult to
prove he was the leader

156
00:10:52,525 --> 00:10:54,692
if I kill him now.

157
00:10:54,775 --> 00:10:58,942
So then, why don't we play a
game using this deck of cards?

158
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,775
If you win, I'll agree to wear
this collar with no complaints.

159
00:11:05,858 --> 00:11:09,108
But if I win, you'll set
me free from this facility.

160
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:10,525
[ACE]
Very well.

161
00:11:10,608 --> 00:11:14,192
However, I'll be choosing
the type of game we play.

162
00:11:14,275 --> 00:11:16,108
Go ahead.

163
00:11:16,192 --> 00:11:18,900
[ACE] I'll deal one card
at a time from the deck.

164
00:11:18,983 --> 00:11:20,483
You have to guess
whether the card

165
00:11:20,567 --> 00:11:23,317
will be higher or lower
than the previous one.

166
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:25,317
If you're correct,
I draw another.

167
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,150
If not, we switch roles.

168
00:11:27,233 --> 00:11:28,650
Once we've gone
through the deck,

169
00:11:28,733 --> 00:11:32,400
the one who's guessed right
the most will be the winner.

170
00:11:32,483 --> 00:11:34,692
You can guess first.

171
00:11:36,067 --> 00:11:39,858
What will the next card be:
Higher? Or lower?

172
00:11:39,942 --> 00:11:42,442
The card values
are 1 through 13.

173
00:11:42,525 --> 00:11:44,775
Chances are slightly higher
that the next card

174
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:46,983
will be lower than nine.

175
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:48,275
Lower.

176
00:11:50,483 --> 00:11:52,983
[ACE]
Correct. Now...

177
00:11:53,067 --> 00:11:55,942
Will the next card
be higher? Lower?

178
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,025
[FYODOR D.]
Hm.

179
00:11:57,108 --> 00:11:58,608
Lower.

180
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,817
Not bad at all.

181
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:04,858
[ACE]
But his luck won't last.

182
00:12:04,942 --> 00:12:07,775
As a gambler, I'm adept at
the skill of card counting

183
00:12:07,858 --> 00:12:11,483
to determine what cards
still remain in the deck.

184
00:12:11,567 --> 00:12:15,442
I have an overwhelming
advantage in the second half.

185
00:12:15,525 --> 00:12:17,900
Next card... Lower.

186
00:12:20,733 --> 00:12:22,108
Higher.

187
00:12:23,358 --> 00:12:25,108
[FYODOR D.]
Higher.

188
00:12:25,192 --> 00:12:26,733
Lower.

189
00:12:26,817 --> 00:12:27,942
[gasps]

190
00:12:28,025 --> 00:12:30,650
Higher. Higher.

191
00:12:30,733 --> 00:12:33,358
Lower. Higher.

192
00:12:33,442 --> 00:12:35,400
Lower. Higher.

193
00:12:35,483 --> 00:12:38,400
Lower. Lower. Higher.

194
00:12:38,483 --> 00:12:40,317
Higher. Lower.

195
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,358
Higher. Higher. Higher.

196
00:12:43,442 --> 00:12:44,442
Lower.

197
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,025
[FYODOR D.]
Oh?

198
00:12:50,108 --> 00:12:51,942
Already finished?

199
00:12:52,025 --> 00:12:54,983
That was quite a fun game,
didn't you think?

200
00:12:59,192 --> 00:13:00,400
[ACE]
Bring in my unit!

201
00:13:00,483 --> 00:13:01,733
We're done messing around.

202
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:05,608
Cut off every limb on
this con artist's body!

203
00:13:05,692 --> 00:13:06,858
Are you listening?

204
00:13:06,942 --> 00:13:08,275
Why aren't you answering?!

205
00:13:08,358 --> 00:13:10,108
[FYODOR D.]
It's no use.

206
00:13:10,192 --> 00:13:12,525
[FYODOR D. chuckles]

207
00:13:17,067 --> 00:13:18,192
[ACE]
What?!

208
00:13:18,275 --> 00:13:20,317
[FYODOR D.]
That door won't open, either.

209
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,817
It took a bit of
preparation from my team,

210
00:13:22,900 --> 00:13:25,983
but my friends have taken
control of the outside.

211
00:13:26,067 --> 00:13:27,608
Being hidden unground,

212
00:13:27,692 --> 00:13:31,275
it's natural a pack
of rats could find me.

213
00:13:31,358 --> 00:13:32,817
All of this was
just a way for you

214
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,608
to buy yourself enough time.

215
00:13:34,692 --> 00:13:35,858
Let's make a deal:

216
00:13:35,942 --> 00:13:37,650
If you hand over the
key to the vault,

217
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:40,817
I'll be sure to guarantee
your safety with my men.

218
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,108
[ACE chuckles]

219
00:13:43,817 --> 00:13:46,733
You're lying to me.

220
00:13:46,817 --> 00:13:50,233
Not even the boss knows
about this secret hideout.

221
00:13:50,317 --> 00:13:53,733
Not only that, we aren't
even underground.

222
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:56,608
We're currently inside
a ship out at sea.

223
00:13:56,692 --> 00:13:59,150
A ship that is equipped
to engage in battle

224
00:13:59,233 --> 00:14:01,150
against the gifted.

225
00:14:01,233 --> 00:14:05,733
Subjugating you was never
going to be peaceful.

226
00:14:05,817 --> 00:14:09,192
All that aside, however,
there's no reason to believe

227
00:14:09,275 --> 00:14:13,275
this room actually
exists, is there?

228
00:14:13,358 --> 00:14:15,900
[FYODOR D.] Let me tell
you about my ability.

229
00:14:15,983 --> 00:14:19,108
It allows me to control
space and consciousness.

230
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:22,067
[ACE] I was listening in
on your conversation,

231
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:24,608
and now I'm certain.

232
00:14:24,692 --> 00:14:27,025
You've been playing
a clever game.

233
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:29,317
Your ability is to
trap a victim's mind

234
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:31,275
inside that of your own.

235
00:14:31,358 --> 00:14:34,192
In other words,
this isn't reality at all,

236
00:14:34,275 --> 00:14:36,192
but somewhere inside your head.

237
00:14:36,275 --> 00:14:39,483
That's right. A space
of your own design!

238
00:14:39,567 --> 00:14:41,817
That's why you could
manipulate the cards' values

239
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:43,567
to suit your needs.

240
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,775
What makes you think that?

241
00:14:45,858 --> 00:14:47,858
[ACE]
The broken communicator,

242
00:14:47,942 --> 00:14:49,900
the locked door,

243
00:14:49,983 --> 00:14:53,692
and lastly, that clock.

244
00:14:53,775 --> 00:14:56,525
You thought I wouldn't
notice, didn't you?

245
00:14:56,608 --> 00:15:00,275
Those hands haven't moved
since I entered this room.

246
00:15:00,358 --> 00:15:04,150
I see right through your little
tricks, you filthy vermin!

247
00:15:04,233 --> 00:15:07,942
Nothing less from one of the
Port Mafia's five executives.

248
00:15:08,025 --> 00:15:10,483
I have to say, I'm impressed.

249
00:15:10,567 --> 00:15:12,608
Now what?

250
00:15:12,692 --> 00:15:16,067
Does it really matter
you've figured things out?

251
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:18,775
The fact that we're conscious
in this fabricated space

252
00:15:18,858 --> 00:15:21,733
means that our bodies in
the real world are not.

253
00:15:21,817 --> 00:15:25,483
Until we starve
to death at least.

254
00:15:25,567 --> 00:15:29,025
I'm well-trained for
this situation, but are you?

255
00:15:29,108 --> 00:15:31,900
Your body in the real world
has the only key to this room,

256
00:15:31,983 --> 00:15:35,692
so your subordinates are
unable to come to your aid.

257
00:15:35,775 --> 00:15:37,275
[ACE]
He's right.

258
00:15:37,358 --> 00:15:41,317
However, what we're in right now
is an ability-created space--

259
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:43,733
merely an illusion.

260
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:46,233
That would mean...

261
00:15:46,317 --> 00:15:48,233
Let me ask you something.

262
00:15:48,317 --> 00:15:51,108
When you were abducted
and brought to this place,

263
00:15:51,192 --> 00:15:54,942
why didn't you use your
ability to escape?

264
00:15:55,025 --> 00:15:56,192
The man who captured you

265
00:15:56,275 --> 00:15:59,233
is one of the top bounty
hunters in the nation.

266
00:15:59,317 --> 00:16:00,525
He carries out his work

267
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:04,192
by acquiring extensive
knowledge on his targets.

268
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:06,483
He learned all there was
to know about you,

269
00:16:06,567 --> 00:16:10,108
which included how to escape
from your mind trapping ability.

270
00:16:10,192 --> 00:16:13,650
That's why you didn't even
bother trying to use it on him.

271
00:16:13,733 --> 00:16:16,483
It would have been futile.

272
00:16:16,567 --> 00:16:19,067
I was born a king.

273
00:16:19,150 --> 00:16:22,608
He who controls information
becomes ruler.

274
00:16:22,692 --> 00:16:24,067
You could've served me,

275
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:27,942
but instead you blew your
opportunity to serve a king!

276
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:29,983
The information I've
gathered has shown me

277
00:16:30,067 --> 00:16:32,067
how I can leave here.

278
00:16:33,233 --> 00:16:34,733
[ACE] I'll delight in
watching your body

279
00:16:34,817 --> 00:16:36,900
rot away in the real world.

280
00:16:36,983 --> 00:16:39,358
So I'm afraid this is farewell.

281
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:40,733
[laughs]

282
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:47,317
[KARMA] I'm sure Ace'll
end up killing that man.

283
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:52,358
There's no way two opposing
forces of evil can coexist.

284
00:16:52,442 --> 00:16:56,233
If I'm sure of anything,
he'll never leave that cell.

285
00:16:56,317 --> 00:16:59,150
He'll be here for
the rest of eternity.

[KARMA gasps]

288
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:09,817
Wha--? How did you get out?

289
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,900
Where's Ace?

290
00:17:11,983 --> 00:17:14,942
[FYODOR D.] Is this the vault
where Ace kept his gems?

291
00:17:15,025 --> 00:17:17,192
He held them just in case
the market crashed,

292
00:17:17,275 --> 00:17:19,067
if I'm not mistaken.

293
00:17:21,942 --> 00:17:24,650
Those are Ace's keys--
why do you have them?

294
00:17:24,733 --> 00:17:27,608
[FYODOR D.]
The answer is simple.

295
00:17:27,692 --> 00:17:29,567
The nature of my ability

296
00:17:29,650 --> 00:17:33,650
isn't one that allows me to
control space and consciousness.

297
00:17:33,733 --> 00:17:35,192
Huh?

298
00:17:37,942 --> 00:17:41,400
Wait, what do you mean by that?

299
00:17:41,483 --> 00:17:45,400
[FYODOR D.] I expected I'd be
under surveillance, so I lied.

300
00:17:46,442 --> 00:17:48,108
[KARMA]
Where's Ace?

301
00:17:48,192 --> 00:17:49,817
[FYODOR D.]
People are eager to believe

302
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,733
that they are acting
with free will.

303
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:54,483
That they know best.

304
00:17:54,567 --> 00:17:57,108
They become so excited
by their own discoveries

305
00:17:57,192 --> 00:17:59,108
that they give them
too much value.

306
00:17:59,192 --> 00:18:02,942
We all loathe to believe
we can be controlled.

307
00:18:03,025 --> 00:18:05,567
The method of escape he heard
from the bounty hunter

308
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:07,608
entailed erasing
ones's consciousness

309
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:10,483
from an ability-created space.

310
00:18:10,567 --> 00:18:12,775
But what he didn't realize:

311
00:18:12,858 --> 00:18:16,025
I gave my abductor that
information on purpose.

[FYODOR D.] Just before he
returned to this cell,

I destroyed the clock and the

316
00:18:58,442 --> 00:19:00,650
stuffed bits of cork
into the lock,

and pretended that we were
in an ability-created space.

318
00:19:06,108 --> 00:19:08,817
[KARMA] He killed one of
the Port Mafia executives

319
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:11,692
with such ease.

320
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:15,067
[FYODOR D.] I enjoyed the
card game we played together.

321
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,608
When it came to how
I was able to win, however,

322
00:19:17,692 --> 00:19:21,817
he was completely mistaken
that I used my ability.

323
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:24,400
I observed the faint
scratches on each card,

324
00:19:24,483 --> 00:19:27,317
and simply committed
all of them to memory.

325
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:30,025
[KARMA] He was able to memorize
something like that?

326
00:19:30,108 --> 00:19:31,442
There's no way!

327
00:19:31,525 --> 00:19:33,858
What kind of a mind
does this guy have?

328
00:19:33,942 --> 00:19:36,067
[FYODOR D.]
The rest is as you see it.

329
00:19:36,150 --> 00:19:38,233
Based on the
assumptions he made,

330
00:19:38,317 --> 00:19:40,942
he decided to end his own life.

331
00:19:42,233 --> 00:19:46,192
Crime starts with thought.
As natural as breathing.

332
00:19:46,275 --> 00:19:49,733
But he was finally able
to be free from all of it.

333
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:51,192
[KARMA]
"Free"?

334
00:19:51,275 --> 00:19:54,275
What the hell is
he talking about?

335
00:19:54,358 --> 00:19:57,067
He just killed a man,
but he's talking about it

336
00:19:57,150 --> 00:20:00,067
like he just put a
sick dog to sleep.

337
00:20:01,108 --> 00:20:05,400
So then, was it actually part
of your plan to be abducted?

338
00:20:05,483 --> 00:20:08,817
Wait, were you after
the gems this whole time?

339
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:10,775
[FYODOR D.]
The gems?

340
00:20:10,858 --> 00:20:14,025
I have no interest in
such worthless pebbles.

341
00:20:17,608 --> 00:20:19,025
[FYODOR D.]
What I was interested in

342
00:20:19,108 --> 00:20:21,692
was a set of documents
he had compiled.

343
00:20:21,775 --> 00:20:24,025
They detail all of the
Port Mafia members'

344
00:20:24,108 --> 00:20:26,275
special abilities.

345
00:20:26,358 --> 00:20:27,942
It even includes information

346
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:30,900
about your boss'
top-secret ability.

347
00:20:30,983 --> 00:20:35,108
By using this, all evils
that plague this world...

348
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,442
...will receive
the mercy of death.

349
00:20:38,525 --> 00:20:40,233
[KARMA]
I see.

350
00:20:40,317 --> 00:20:44,525
From the very beginning,
Ace never stood a chance.

351
00:20:44,608 --> 00:20:49,817
Ace was evil for sure,
but this man is something else.

352
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:52,192
He comes from a world beyond.

353
00:20:52,275 --> 00:20:56,483
He's a thing that exceeds
human comprehension.

354
00:20:56,567 --> 00:20:58,067
If the Port Mafia were to learn

355
00:20:58,150 --> 00:21:00,192
that this information
has been leaked,

356
00:21:00,275 --> 00:21:03,067
this list would lose at
least half of its value.

357
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:06,192
As a result, I cannot
allow people to find out

358
00:21:06,275 --> 00:21:07,567
what's happened here.

359
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:10,067
Because of that,
I will do you the honor

360
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:12,900
of granting you
the Great Silence.

361
00:21:14,733 --> 00:21:17,233
I just had to accept it.

362
00:21:17,317 --> 00:21:21,067
No one would ever wanna come
and save a villain like me.

363
00:21:24,067 --> 00:21:25,942
[KARMA]
I understand now who's capable

364
00:21:26,025 --> 00:21:28,567
of giving redemption to evil.

365
00:21:34,775 --> 00:21:38,400
What you are witnessing
now is my true ability.

366
00:21:40,942 --> 00:21:44,650
[KARMA] He's a thing darker
and more hideous than evil.

367
00:21:44,733 --> 00:21:48,317
He's the one who's going
to destroy the Port Mafia.

368
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:54,567
[KARMA] If this is when my life
had to come to an end...

369
00:21:56,025 --> 00:21:59,108
[KARMA] ...it wasn't
much of a life at all.

370
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:02,858
But hey, at least
this isn't too bad.

371
00:22:05,067 --> 00:22:06,025
[FYODOR D.]
May you be freed

372
00:22:06,108 --> 00:22:08,067
from the shackles
of your crimes,

373
00:22:08,150 --> 00:22:11,317
and your soul be salvaged.

374
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,733
All of the Port Mafia is next,

375
00:22:13,817 --> 00:22:18,025
along with... the Armed
Detective Agency.

376
00:23:51,775 --> 00:23:53,692
[ICHIYOU] Mr. Akutagawa
met up with a young woman,

377
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:55,358
and they went home together...

378
00:23:55,442 --> 00:23:58,942
Absurd! There's gotta be
more to this than meets the eye.

379
00:23:59,025 --> 00:24:02,858
Is she an enemy assassin?
Or maybe a secret agent?

380
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:06,525
Either way,
I need to expose her!

381
00:24:06,608 --> 00:24:09,900
[ATSUSHI] Next time on
<i>Bungo Stray Dogs</i> , Episode 30:

382
00:24:09,983 --> 00:24:12,858
"Slap the Stick & Addict."

383
00:24:14,442 --> 00:24:16,983
[ICHIYOU] This isn't a
matter of personal interest.

384
00:24:17,067 --> 00:24:18,567
It's a mission!
