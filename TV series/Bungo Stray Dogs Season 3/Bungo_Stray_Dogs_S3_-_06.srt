1
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,567
[KYOUKA]
I could use some more soy sauce.

2
00:00:27,108 --> 00:00:29,775
I don't like abilities
that act on their own.

3
00:00:29,858 --> 00:00:31,150
It's all right.

4
00:00:31,233 --> 00:00:33,483
Don't forget that Demon Snow
also saved you before

5
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:35,275
when you really needed her.

6
00:00:35,358 --> 00:00:37,317
[ATSUSHI] Except we
can't forget Demon Snow

7
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:40,442
also killed Kyouka's parents.

8
00:00:40,525 --> 00:00:42,192
If Demon Snow were human,

9
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,900
I could sever her
third cervical nerve

10
00:00:43,983 --> 00:00:46,483
so she'd never reach
for anything again.

11
00:00:48,067 --> 00:00:51,400
[ATSUSHI] The things Kyouka
knows about really scare me.

12
00:02:23,733 --> 00:02:25,858
[ATSUSHI] This is the Wanted
List the military police

13
00:02:25,942 --> 00:02:27,275
sends us every month,

14
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,317
and this is the
document that shows

15
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:31,275
our regular bodyguard clients.

16
00:02:31,358 --> 00:02:33,733
[KYOUKA] I know.
I already memorized them.

17
00:02:33,817 --> 00:02:36,942
Really? It took me a
whole month to do that.

18
00:02:37,025 --> 00:02:38,400
Welcome. Come on in.

19
00:02:38,483 --> 00:02:40,233
[ATSUSHI gasps]

20
00:02:41,858 --> 00:02:43,442
[ATSUSHI]
Oh, yeah, I forgot.

21
00:02:43,525 --> 00:02:45,942
She actually works here now.

22
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:49,317
You have any
good specials today?

23
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,858
Yeah, dark-roasted muddy water!

24
00:02:51,942 --> 00:02:53,108
[ATSUSHI]
This is Lucy.

25
00:02:53,192 --> 00:02:55,025
She's an ex-Guild member.

26
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:57,983
She's decided to work here
full-time as a waitress now.

27
00:02:58,067 --> 00:02:59,400
--Listen, you.
--Yes?

28
00:02:59,483 --> 00:03:02,108
[LUCY] Do you have any clue
as to why I'm here now?

29
00:03:02,192 --> 00:03:03,150
[ATSUSHI]
Huh?

30
00:03:03,233 --> 00:03:05,900
To take revenge.
Revenge against you.

31
00:03:05,983 --> 00:03:08,858
You'd better remember exactly
what I'm talking about.

32
00:03:08,942 --> 00:03:10,733
I remember you were
the one who saved me

33
00:03:10,817 --> 00:03:12,192
that day when we were
on the Moby Dick.

34
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:13,150
[KYOUKA]
Hot milk.

35
00:03:13,233 --> 00:03:14,108
[BOTH]
Hm?

36
00:03:14,192 --> 00:03:15,733
With sugar please.

37
00:03:21,358 --> 00:03:22,733
[LUCY]
Hmph!

38
00:03:22,817 --> 00:03:25,733
If you don't remember why
I'm taking revenge on you...

39
00:03:25,817 --> 00:03:28,483
...I will strangle you to death.

40
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:29,525
Hmph!

41
00:03:33,317 --> 00:03:34,608
Don't worry.

42
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:37,858
If she tries something,
I'll cut her with my sword.

43
00:03:40,275 --> 00:03:43,817
[ATSUSHI] Gosh. I wonder
what I did wrong...

44
00:03:46,192 --> 00:03:48,442
[ATSUSHI]
All this time, I thought we had

45
00:03:48,525 --> 00:03:50,900
a good understanding
of each other.

46
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:56,483
[LUCY]
Oh, I almost forgot.

47
00:03:56,567 --> 00:04:00,775
Some weirdo delivered this.
It's for the Detective Agency.

48
00:04:01,775 --> 00:04:03,608
I didn't say it was for you.

49
00:04:03,692 --> 00:04:05,817
It's actually for
this little shrimp.

50
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:06,900
[KYOUKA]
Hm?

51
00:04:06,983 --> 00:04:08,483
It's for me?

52
00:04:13,108 --> 00:04:16,067
[ATSUSHI] We are requested
to pick up and deliver

53
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:18,900
a briefcase to a
specified company.

54
00:04:18,983 --> 00:04:21,067
The briefcase contains
a large sum of money

55
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:24,442
and is supposed to be in one
of the boats in this harbor.

56
00:04:26,275 --> 00:04:27,942
[ATSUSHI]
But which one?

57
00:04:28,025 --> 00:04:29,900
Did they accidentally
leave that out?

58
00:04:29,983 --> 00:04:32,233
It doesn't say anything
about which boat.

59
00:04:32,317 --> 00:04:35,733
Then we'll just have to
split up and start searching.

60
00:04:35,817 --> 00:04:37,358
That's a good idea.

61
00:04:41,858 --> 00:04:43,775
[chuckles]

62
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:47,400
[MAN]
Get out!

63
00:04:48,733 --> 00:04:51,275
[MAN] You're trespassing,
you little brat!

64
00:04:51,358 --> 00:04:52,858
[ATSUSHI]
Sorry, sir!

65
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,275
This totally sucks.

66
00:04:58,358 --> 00:04:59,483
I'm bound to get reported

67
00:04:59,567 --> 00:05:01,900
if I have to keep on
searching like this.

68
00:05:01,983 --> 00:05:04,858
[LUCY] In a bit of a
bind, thieving kitty?

69
00:05:04,942 --> 00:05:06,567
Ta-da.

70
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:08,692
You pulled that page
out on purpose?

71
00:05:08,775 --> 00:05:10,150
Of course I did.

72
00:05:10,233 --> 00:05:13,358
How would it be revenge if
I gave you the whole thing?

73
00:05:14,692 --> 00:05:16,275
What's with the stupid face?

74
00:05:16,358 --> 00:05:18,150
And for heaven's sake,
don't tell me you still

75
00:05:18,233 --> 00:05:20,150
don't have any
idea why I'm angry.

76
00:05:20,233 --> 00:05:21,900
[ATSUSHI]
N-No, of course I do.

77
00:05:21,983 --> 00:05:26,150
It's because... well... uhh...

78
00:05:26,233 --> 00:05:27,817
You don't like how
I cut my bangs?

79
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:29,192
[LUCY]
Are you crazy?!

80
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:30,942
Stop joking around, you fool!

81
00:05:31,025 --> 00:05:32,150
Don't you remember what I said

82
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,775
when I helped you escape
from the Moby Dick?

83
00:05:35,775 --> 00:05:39,525
You can rescue me from
this place someday.

84
00:05:39,608 --> 00:05:41,483
I'll be waiting.

85
00:05:41,567 --> 00:05:42,775
It's a promise.

86
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:44,150
And yet look what you've done!

87
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:45,567
Wait, hold on!

88
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,775
I know that you were
evacuated off the Moby Dick

89
00:05:47,858 --> 00:05:49,650
and flown back down
to the ground.

90
00:05:49,733 --> 00:05:50,817
I couldn't've saved you.

91
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,108
Oh, give me a break!

92
00:05:52,192 --> 00:05:53,942
Couldn't you have at least
said something to me

93
00:05:54,025 --> 00:05:56,400
when we first saw
each other again?

94
00:05:58,067 --> 00:06:01,317
If you really want this page,
then you'll have to swim for it!

95
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,733
Stupid cat!

96
00:06:15,525 --> 00:06:17,983
[ATSUSHI] That must be
an old mooring chain.

97
00:06:29,108 --> 00:06:31,233
What's taking him so long?

98
00:06:33,817 --> 00:06:36,108
Hey, you're joking
around, right?

99
00:06:44,608 --> 00:06:47,150
[ATSUSHI coughing]

100
00:06:47,233 --> 00:06:49,067
How could you be such an idiot?!

101
00:06:49,150 --> 00:06:50,983
You're the gifted who
defeated the Guild!

102
00:06:51,067 --> 00:06:53,400
And you were about to drown
right next to the dock!

103
00:06:53,483 --> 00:06:54,858
Where am I?

104
00:06:54,942 --> 00:06:56,650
I had to transport you
out of the water

105
00:06:56,733 --> 00:06:58,525
and into Anne's room, okay?

106
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:02,025
My ability doesn't work unless
I'm very close to my target.

107
00:07:02,108 --> 00:07:04,733
And now I'm a soggy
rat just like you!

108
00:07:04,817 --> 00:07:05,817
[ATSUSHI]
Thank you.

109
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:07,067
Huh?

110
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,317
I owe you my life again.

111
00:07:12,192 --> 00:07:13,608
[ATSUSHI]
I'm sorry.

112
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,858
When I infiltrated
the Moby Dick,

113
00:07:15,942 --> 00:07:19,692
I really thought I would be
able to go back and save you.

114
00:07:19,775 --> 00:07:22,275
I ended up being chased
around by Akutagawa

115
00:07:22,358 --> 00:07:26,192
and it wasn't long after that
that the Moby Dick crashed.

116
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:28,817
I tried my best to find you.

117
00:07:31,108 --> 00:07:33,275
So you did look for me?

118
00:07:33,358 --> 00:07:36,608
I was so glad when I found
out you weren't there.

119
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,150
I used revenge as an excuse.

120
00:07:41,233 --> 00:07:43,983
The real reason I started
that waitress job at the café

121
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,858
was because I wanted
to apologize to you

122
00:07:45,942 --> 00:07:48,400
for not waiting like I promised.

123
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:53,025
And... another thing--

124
00:07:54,775 --> 00:07:56,858
[ATSUSHI sneezes]

125
00:07:56,942 --> 00:07:58,358
I'm soaked.

126
00:07:58,442 --> 00:08:01,733
I won't be able to finish work
wearing these wet clothes.

127
00:08:01,817 --> 00:08:03,025
I know.

128
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:07,858
If you can transport a person's
body from the water,

129
00:08:07,942 --> 00:08:10,858
could you also transport the
moisture from wet clothes?

130
00:08:10,942 --> 00:08:12,233
Huh?

131
00:08:12,317 --> 00:08:13,692
Hear me out.

132
00:08:13,775 --> 00:08:16,483
[ATSUSHI] First, you return
the two of us to reality.

133
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,650
Then, re-transport just the
two of us and our clothes,

134
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,108
but without the moisture.

135
00:08:22,192 --> 00:08:25,817
That way, we'll have our dry
clothes back on instantly.

136
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,650
[LUCY grumbles]

137
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,567
Don't blame me if
it doesn't work out.

138
00:08:42,025 --> 00:08:45,275
[screams]

139
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,775
[KYOUKA]
Hm?

140
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,858
Another all-nighter, Ango?
You look kinda beat.

141
00:08:57,942 --> 00:08:59,567
What happened here?

142
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,025
[OPERATIVE] A Special Operations
Division transport vehicle

143
00:09:02,108 --> 00:09:04,858
was attacked and our
reports were stolen.

144
00:09:04,942 --> 00:09:07,483
There was a single attacker
dressed like a postal worker,

145
00:09:07,567 --> 00:09:09,025
or so we're told.

146
00:09:09,108 --> 00:09:12,983
One person ambushed an armed
Special Operations vehicle?

147
00:09:13,067 --> 00:09:15,775
Whoever it is must
be pretty skilled.

148
00:09:15,858 --> 00:09:18,067
Do we know which
reports they stole?

149
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,192
They took Document
Number... E-7-5-8-1-A.

150
00:09:22,275 --> 00:09:23,942
They took that one?

151
00:09:24,025 --> 00:09:26,358
Do you know what that
report's about?

152
00:09:26,442 --> 00:09:30,317
It's got investigative data that
would reduce her punishment.

153
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:32,733
It's about the
ability Demon Snow

154
00:09:32,817 --> 00:09:35,858
and about her parents
whom she killed.

155
00:09:35,942 --> 00:09:37,483
The ability's one thing,

156
00:09:37,567 --> 00:09:40,358
but why would she
wanna kill her parents?

157
00:09:40,442 --> 00:09:43,817
All I know is that her
parents were on our side.

158
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,692
And that she has their talent.
That's for certain.

159
00:09:49,983 --> 00:09:53,067
There's the boat from

Well, that's just fine with me,
'cause I don't want your trust.

That's the briefcase all right.

There's nothing inside.

Don't look at me!
I didn't steal it!

[KYOUKA]
There's something in the bottom.

00:10:30,275 --> 00:10:32,525
It's an Employment Gift?

[ATSUSHI] The report contained
a description of all the events

that happened on the day
Kyouka's parents died.

173
00:10:44,525 --> 00:10:46,608
Hey, Kyouka,

174
00:10:46,692 --> 00:10:49,942
do you have any idea what
your parents did for a living?

00:10:50,025 --> 00:10:51,692
No, I don't.

Oh, nothing.

I'm just happy I didn't have
to work too late tonight.

00:11:13,608 --> 00:11:16,817
Dinner's delicious and I get to
be with you and our daughter.

180
00:11:16,900 --> 00:11:19,025
This is the greatest moment...

...of my life.

[ATSUSHI] Kyouka's father was a
former spy for the government.

183
00:11:30,275 --> 00:11:33,108
[ATSUSHI] Her mother was
gifted with Demon Snow,

00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,400
a murderous ability.

185
00:11:35,483 --> 00:11:37,150
She and her husband

in countless assassinations.

You must go now, Kyouka.

Your mother... will always be...

[screams]

201
00:12:46,025 --> 00:12:48,358
[ATSUSHI] Her parents were
struck down by a gifted

202
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:51,025
who had a score to
settle with them.

203
00:12:51,108 --> 00:12:52,483
Since the government was unable

204
00:12:52,567 --> 00:12:54,942
to publicly acknowledge
her parents,

205
00:12:55,025 --> 00:12:58,233
they said Kyouka's mom had
lost control of her ability.

206
00:12:58,317 --> 00:12:59,942
Okay, but that
doesn't make sense.

207
00:13:00,025 --> 00:13:02,525
Demon Snow was my
ability, not hers.

208
00:13:02,608 --> 00:13:04,275
I've always heard there's a way

209
00:13:04,358 --> 00:13:08,108
to transfer abilities
to family members.

210
00:13:08,192 --> 00:13:11,067
It seems your mother learned
this technique from a gifted

211
00:13:11,150 --> 00:13:13,400
who controlled black shadows.

212
00:13:15,108 --> 00:13:19,525
Except it was a sudden attack
so the transfer was partial.

213
00:13:19,608 --> 00:13:22,317
Now Demon Snow can
only be controlled

214
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:24,567
through using that cell phone.

215
00:13:26,108 --> 00:13:28,733
[KYOUKA] A few days before
my parents were killed,

216
00:13:28,817 --> 00:13:30,775
Mother gave me this
cellphone and told me

217
00:13:30,858 --> 00:13:34,567
that I should never let go
of it as long as I live.

218
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,358
[ATSUSHI]
That's why Kyouka always had

219
00:13:36,442 --> 00:13:37,525
her cell phone with her,

220
00:13:37,608 --> 00:13:41,317
even after she joined
the Port Mafia.

221
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,442
[KYOUKA] Now I understand
what I saw that day.

222
00:13:47,525 --> 00:13:51,108
Demon Snow wasn't responsible
for killing my parents.

anything I can do-- Ah!

You're so dense.

but it was actually the
embodiment of their love.

Exactly.

[JUNICHIROU] So the victim
is a male in his 40s.

He was struck by the truck
and died on impact.

His face was destroyed,
so we don't know who he is yet.

According to what
the driver said,

he jumped out into the road.

is still around.

Painful? Not at all.

I don't even wanna know.

every day of my life abandoned.

knew who I really was.

and when you do, Atsushi,
I want you to hate me.

303
00:18:22,442 --> 00:18:24,983
But never hate yourself.

I have the rest of the article
the victim was holding onto.

00:18:35,608 --> 00:18:38,817
It was found on the
other side of the road.

307

It seems the headmaster was
actually here to look for you.

308
00:18:42,733 --> 00:18:45,692
He came to Yokohama
after he saw this story.

309
00:18:45,775 --> 00:18:48,275
The paper even ran photos
of the fight with the Guild.

310
00:18:48,358 --> 00:18:51,942
Guess they must've slipped 'em
past the Special Ops Division.

311
00:18:52,025 --> 00:18:55,442
And I got more information
from the orphanage staff.

312
00:18:55,525 --> 00:18:57,192
It looks like the
headmaster learned about

what you'd been doing
from this article.

he wanted to wish you--

00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:05,525
Lies! It can't be! No way!

316
00:19:05,608 --> 00:19:08,192
He would... never...

317
00:19:09,483 --> 00:19:10,650
Atsushi.

318
00:19:12,650 --> 00:19:14,275
[sighs]

319
00:19:14,358 --> 00:19:16,983
So are you happy with
the way things turned out?

320
00:19:17,067 --> 00:19:18,525
Are you, Dazai?

321
00:19:29,442 --> 00:19:32,358
[OSAMU] Does it hurt you to
see kids with their parents?

322
00:19:35,983 --> 00:19:39,525
Hey, Dazai, do you
remember the first time

323
00:19:39,608 --> 00:19:41,525
that you and I met each other?

324
00:19:41,608 --> 00:19:44,942
Sure. We were
looking for the tiger.

325
00:19:45,025 --> 00:19:46,692
Lemme ask you this:

326
00:19:46,775 --> 00:19:48,067
Why do you think the headmaster

327
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:51,025
didn't tell anyone
I was the tiger?

328
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:53,525
Well, he must've had
quite a good reason.

329
00:19:53,608 --> 00:19:57,150
Maintaining that secret would've
taken some serious effort.

330
00:19:57,233 --> 00:20:00,858
Especially since he was trying
to keep the truth from you.

331
00:20:02,192 --> 00:20:04,983
"Find a flower shop."

332
00:20:05,067 --> 00:20:08,150
Rampo was right all along.

333
00:20:08,233 --> 00:20:10,942
The headmaster was
walking to a florist.

334
00:20:11,025 --> 00:20:16,275
He was going to buy flowers...
and give them to me when we met.

335
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:17,608
And yet...

336
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,192
[horn blares]

337
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:37,233
[ATSUSHI]
None of that matters.

338
00:20:37,317 --> 00:20:39,733
I still can't forgive him.

339
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:42,150
I really...

340
00:20:42,233 --> 00:20:44,400
I really suffered.

341
00:20:44,483 --> 00:20:48,275
There's nothing he could ever
do to make me forgive him.

342
00:20:49,567 --> 00:20:51,483
[OSAMU]
You don't need to forgive him.

343
00:20:51,567 --> 00:20:53,608
No matter what
his reasons were,

344
00:20:53,692 --> 00:20:55,942
what he did to you
was unforgivable.

345
00:20:56,025 --> 00:20:58,400
Absolutely barbaric.

346
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:02,400
[OSAMU] You were truly
in the depths of hell.

347
00:21:02,483 --> 00:21:04,983
But... living through that hell

348
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:07,775
shaped you into the
person you are now.

349
00:21:07,858 --> 00:21:09,108
[gasps]

350
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:12,192
[ATSUSHI]
If I could save them...

351
00:21:12,275 --> 00:21:14,358
If I could get all of the
passengers on the train

352
00:21:14,442 --> 00:21:16,525
back to their homes
safe and sound...

353
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,233
...wouldn't that be enough?

354
00:21:18,317 --> 00:21:19,692
I'll do it!

355
00:21:25,067 --> 00:21:28,400
[ATSUSHI] I'll prove
that I deserve to live.

356
00:21:28,483 --> 00:21:30,358
[OSAMU] Because of that,
you became someone

357
00:21:30,442 --> 00:21:32,567
who understands suffering.

358
00:21:32,650 --> 00:21:36,525
You resisted violence and
evil and saved many people

359
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:38,817
who were in positions
of weakness.

360
00:21:43,358 --> 00:21:44,942
But, Dazai.

361
00:21:45,025 --> 00:21:46,525
Right now,

362
00:21:46,608 --> 00:21:50,608
I feel like there's something
inside me that's about to burst.

363
00:21:50,692 --> 00:21:52,442
I don't understand.

364
00:21:52,525 --> 00:21:55,192
What am I feeling?!

365
00:21:55,275 --> 00:21:56,692
[OSAMU]
No one can fully grasp

366
00:21:56,775 --> 00:21:59,442
another person's
deepest emotions.

367
00:21:59,525 --> 00:22:01,192
It's impossible.

368
00:22:01,275 --> 00:22:04,192
Only you can understand
what you're feeling.

369
00:22:07,233 --> 00:22:11,108
But generally speaking,
I can tell you this...

370
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:17,983
[OSAMU] Most people... tend to
cry when their father dies.

371
00:23:52,067 --> 00:23:54,567
[FITZGERALD] I've lost
all of my fortune and status.

372
00:23:54,650 --> 00:23:56,483
I failed to save my wife.

373
00:23:56,567 --> 00:23:58,983
I am the crumbs
of a desperate soul,

374
00:23:59,067 --> 00:24:01,900
and they burn the ramins of
the deceased in this nation.

375
00:24:01,983 --> 00:24:04,608
[ALCOTT] Your value isn't in
your money or your status.

376
00:24:04,692 --> 00:24:06,567
It's in your qualities
as a leader.

377
00:24:06,650 --> 00:24:08,442
The only way I
became so powerful

378
00:24:08,525 --> 00:24:09,858
was through your direction,

379
00:24:09,942 --> 00:24:12,733
devising strategies
under your command.

380
00:24:12,817 --> 00:24:18,358
