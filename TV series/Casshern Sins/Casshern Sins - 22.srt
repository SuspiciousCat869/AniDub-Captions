[Ringo in cries out in pain]

00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,416
[Ringo]
Casshern!

3
00:00:21,375 --> 00:00:22,958
Casshern.

4
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:32,291
[Ringo cries out]

5
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,708
Lyuze?

6
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:39,000
I've decided to go.

7
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,250
You have?

8
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,500
I'll be fine...

9
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:45,833
[Lyuze grimaces]

10
00:00:45,916 --> 00:00:47,250
[Ringo]
Lyuze, I'm sorry...!

11
00:00:47,333 --> 00:00:49,666
I ran off and now you're hurt...

12
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,375
[Lyuze] I'm alright...
How are you doing?

13
00:00:52,458 --> 00:00:54,208
[Ringo]
I'm fine.

14
00:00:54,291 --> 00:00:55,750
Ringo.

15
00:00:55,833 --> 00:00:57,416
Casshern.

16
00:02:34,375 --> 00:02:37,958
We now have Luna
in our hands... finally...

17
00:02:38,041 --> 00:02:40,750
Soon the ruin will be over.

18
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:43,791
Why are we not giving
healing to everyone?

19
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,041
[Leda] What would be the point
if everyone were the same...?

20
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:54,166
Beauty exists because there
are so many who aren't.

21
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,416
Because...

22
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:57,333
...if you are not envied...

23
00:02:57,416 --> 00:03:00,750
...how can one experience
the value of beauty?

24
00:03:00,833 --> 00:03:03,125
Those with...
the gift of beauty...

25
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:08,041
...will identify us as the
ones who granted it to them.

26
00:03:08,125 --> 00:03:10,208
[Leda] I take it you
don't understand?

27
00:03:10,291 --> 00:03:13,375
No matter you can
do whatever you please.

28
00:03:13,458 --> 00:03:18,041
[Leda] Let us go
to Luna... together.

29
00:03:18,125 --> 00:03:22,708
There is much to be done,
like us gaining eternal life.

30
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,291
[Dio]
I don't want it.

31
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:25,750
[Leda]
You don't want it...?

32
00:03:25,833 --> 00:03:27,166
What do you mean...?

33
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,916
Even you are showing
signs of ruin!

34
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:42,375
So you've gone from
being a boy to a man...

35
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:47,166
I must admit that makes
me... a little bit sad.

36
00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:48,833
[Leda]
Very well...

37
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:51,291
though you will
change your mind...

38
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:54,625
You'll have to find a
way to stop your decay.

39
00:03:56,416 --> 00:03:59,583
[Leda]
And then... I will...

40
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,625
[drop of water in pool]

41
00:04:11,750 --> 00:04:13,000
[Luna] I was
starting to wonder

42
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:15,875
why no one had
come in for awhile...

43
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:20,708
Shall I perform
the healing here?

44
00:04:26,208 --> 00:04:28,125
From here on out
your healing will be

45
00:04:28,208 --> 00:04:31,166
reserved for only
the chosen ones.

46
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,166
I won't allow you to

47
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:35,041
stop the ruin on
your own anymore.

48
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,500
Why's that?

49
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,583
Because I said so, that's why.

50
00:04:41,583 --> 00:04:42,666
[Leda]
I suppose you believe

51
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:44,958
saving everyone is
part of your destiny,

52
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,833
but unfortunately...

53
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,291
you're going to
have to stop...

54
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:52,833
And if you defy me...

55
00:04:52,916 --> 00:04:55,375
[Luna]
I don't mind that.

56
00:04:56,500 --> 00:05:01,166
[Luna] All I do is eliminate the
death that is put before me.

57
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:04,458
So... we have an understanding.

58
00:05:05,208 --> 00:05:07,750
And you?

59
00:05:07,833 --> 00:05:09,208
Sorry?

60
00:05:09,791 --> 00:05:11,291
Answer me this...

61
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:13,916
Are you one of
these chosen few?

62
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,583
[Luna cries out]

63
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:25,250
Luna... You are done
playing queen... so...

64
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:29,166
...now I will be the one
granting or denying healing,

65
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:31,625
only I will do it through you.

66
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:44,166
[Luna]
If that's what you want.

67
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:58,791
Gaining eternal life...
you lust for it don't you?

68
00:06:02,375 --> 00:06:04,166
Now come.

69
00:06:11,083 --> 00:06:14,333
Luna... Give me your blood.

70
00:06:34,458 --> 00:06:38,708
And now... my ruin
will finally come to an end.

71
00:06:53,333 --> 00:06:57,333
[Leda]
I... no longer see death.

72
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,375
[Leda chuckles]

73
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,083

[Casshern grimaces in pain]

75
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:41,375
[robot henchman A]
He's been trying to heal

76
00:07:41,458 --> 00:07:44,250
himself for hours...

77
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:48,291
Though his chances of
a perfect recovery are slim.

78
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:49,250
[Dio]
He will.

79
00:07:49,333 --> 00:07:50,708
[robot henchman A]
Huh?

80
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:53,041
You better recover, Casshern...

81
00:07:53,125 --> 00:07:56,791
So that you may stand
before me once again...

82
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,750
And if you don't
then I swear I'll...

83
00:07:59,833 --> 00:08:01,291
[Casshern wails in pain]

84
00:08:01,375 --> 00:08:04,041
[Dio]
Recover... and fight me!

85
00:08:10,125 --> 00:08:11,208
[Ringo]
Come on, Ohji...!

86
00:08:11,291 --> 00:08:12,541
We have to save him!

87
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:13,916
I already told you.

88
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,125
He'll be fine!

89
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,208
But you saw Casshern, Ohji,

90
00:08:18,291 --> 00:08:20,458
he was suffering and in pain...

91
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:22,416
So much pain.

92
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,541
[Lyuze]
It's okay.

93
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:30,208
[Ringo]
Casshern.

94
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:33,875
[Lyuze]
We'll save him I promise.

95
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,166
[impact]

96
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,208
There's no end to it.

97
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:03,875
[robot guardian]
Yeah.

98
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:07,791
[Braiking Boss]
It's why the one who

99
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:10,791
dug these graves ended
up running away.

100
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,500
And why I had to take over.

101
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:14,875
It's certainly not
for my health.

102
00:09:14,958 --> 00:09:17,291
You know you
could always run.

103
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,416
No, I can't...

104
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:24,750
That would be akin to
giving in to the ruin.

105
00:09:31,583 --> 00:09:33,375
[robot guardian]
But don't get me wrong...

106
00:09:33,458 --> 00:09:37,125
I don't think the guy who
ran off lost by doing that...

107
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:42,333
We all have different things
we must do in our lives.

108
00:09:42,416 --> 00:09:44,708
[robot guardian]
Different priorities.

109
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,750
You don't say... huh.

110
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,666
It's over...

111
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,416
The ruin has stopped.

112
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,791
[Leda]
It's beautiful...!

113
00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:08,833
I now hold the world
in the palm of my hand.

114
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:18,666
[Leda] Soon I will move to an
entirely new level of being.

115
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,083
That of never ending life.

116
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,166
Dio you have to see!

117
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,458
[Leda]
My ruin. It's stopped...!

118
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,541
I feel like my old self again...

119
00:10:33,625 --> 00:10:35,625
Light as a feather!

120
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,875
Dio, it's time you
stopped your ruin as well...

121
00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:43,000
Once you do
everything will change...

122
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:46,500
You won't be worried
about Casshern anymore.

123
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,833
[Dio] Don't you dare
raise a finger at him.

124
00:10:48,916 --> 00:10:51,125
But the problem
is he's in our way...

125
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,250
The only one's who should

126
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:55,500
have immortal bodies
are you and I,

127
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:59,041
Surely... crushing his
head should be enough.

128
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:01,833
[Dio] I'll be the one
to defeat Casshern.

129
00:11:01,916 --> 00:11:03,958
Wait... Have you seen him...?

130
00:11:04,041 --> 00:11:06,166
He's already defeated...!

131
00:11:06,250 --> 00:11:07,250
Don't you realize?

132
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:08,583
You've already beat him.

133
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,291
No... You don't decide that.

134
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:12,875
[Leda]
Listen... I feel like

135
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:17,125
my entire body is
brimming with life!

136
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:20,708
Dio... You and I...

137
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:25,166
We can do what no
robot's ever done before.

138
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,666
[Leda] We have the
ability to create life!

139
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:35,166
Leda... do you really
still desire that?

140
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:39,333
[Leda]
Dio... We can become Gods.

141
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:41,833
There is only one thing
I desire in this life.

142
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:45,041
And that is to fight
and defeat Casshern.

143
00:11:45,125 --> 00:11:46,500
Now wait.

144
00:11:46,583 --> 00:11:49,041
I'm leaving the castle.

145
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,125
You're doing what?

146
00:11:51,208 --> 00:11:53,875
You can stay here
and fulfill your dreams...

147
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:56,166
I'll be taking on Casshern.

148
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,458
[Leda]
And what if I say no...?

149
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,291
Anything out of my
control is an impediment...!

150
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,875
I will not stand for it!

151
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:12,416
Don't become an obstacle.

152
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:17,875
Are you saying you're
willing to kill me?

153
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,750
Whether you live or die
is entirely up to you.

154
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:27,958
It's been so long...

155
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,083
...that we've been together...
I never imagined it would

156
00:12:31,166 --> 00:12:34,666
end with us at each
other's throats, like this.

157
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,333
[shattering]

158
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:42,291
[Leda lets out a shocked gasp]

159
00:12:42,375 --> 00:12:43,833
[Leda]
Why...?

160
00:12:43,916 --> 00:12:46,041
I thought I was healed!

161
00:12:46,125 --> 00:12:47,250
Here's an idea...

162
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,750
Go back and have
her heal you again...

163
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,000
...as many times as you need.

164
00:12:52,083 --> 00:12:54,333
Don't walk away from me!

165
00:13:20,791 --> 00:13:24,125
Wait...? What is Dio
doing with Casshern?

166
00:13:37,625 --> 00:13:40,666
Luna... Can you explain this?

167
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,125
I thought the ruin
was supposed to disappear!

168
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:44,916
Oh... Well maybe

169
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,500
the healing I gave
you wasn't strong enough...

170
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,083
However, rest assured that
this will have absolutely

171
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:52,500
no bearing on
your eternal life...

172
00:13:52,583 --> 00:13:53,833
So don't worry.

173
00:13:53,916 --> 00:13:57,208
Eternal life's meaningless
if I'm not perfect...

174
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,875
If I'm not beautiful.

175
00:13:59,958 --> 00:14:02,708
[Luna]
But you are beautiful.

176
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,166
[Leda]
I know what's going on.

177
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,166
You don't want anyone
else to have your beauty.

178
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:14,416
And that explains why

179
00:14:14,500 --> 00:14:17,458
you didn't fully
heal me before.

180
00:14:21,166 --> 00:14:24,166
You said the healing
wasn't strong enough...

181
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,416
If that is the case then...

182
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:27,833
I want more of it...

183
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,208
...your blood.

184
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:32,458
I've no problem with that...

185
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,750
But be warned,
it will be painful for you.

186
00:14:35,833 --> 00:14:37,208
I don't care about that...

187
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:39,250
I can handle it!

188
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,458
[Luna grunts and blood splashes]

189
00:15:00,291 --> 00:15:02,250
[Leda sighs]

190
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:05,625
It's coming...

191
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,541
Soon I will
obtain everything...

192
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,083
great power...

193
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:14,750
Pure beauty... Endless life.

194
00:15:23,125 --> 00:15:25,708
[Casshern cries out in pain]

195
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:41,541
Why me?

196
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:43,916
I'm not saving
you from death...

197
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,708
I merely kept you alive
so that I could fight you...

198
00:15:46,791 --> 00:15:48,750
...without interruption.

199
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,916
Now do whatever you
have to do to get back

200
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,208
to the shape you
were in before.

201
00:15:56,291 --> 00:15:58,291
But I... can't...

202
00:15:58,375 --> 00:16:00,166
...not anymore.

203
00:16:01,916 --> 00:16:05,875
[Casshern bellows in pain]

204
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,958
Endure it...

205
00:16:23,041 --> 00:16:24,625
You owe me that much, Casshern.

206
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,708
For I'm only alive
to fight you!

207
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,708
I was able to survive...

208
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:36,041
...and now it's your
turn to do the same.

209
00:16:59,458 --> 00:17:03,041
[Luna] Perhaps I went
a little too far this time...

210
00:17:03,125 --> 00:17:06,416
...but still, there's
no need to worry.

211
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,500
[Leda moans in agony]

212
00:17:18,625 --> 00:17:22,208
Isn't eternal life
just so beautiful...?

213
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:27,250
To think I have the power
to make people live.

214
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,125
[Luna]
I will not kill them...

215
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:34,750
...like the old me would have.

216
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:38,625
[Leda moans in agony]

217
00:17:38,708 --> 00:17:41,791
It's so very wonderful.

218
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:48,458
[Leda moans and
then screams in agony]

219
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:53,541
[Casshern wails in agony]

220
00:18:43,291 --> 00:18:45,083
[thunder]

221
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:04,625
[Casshern] The rain...
has it stopped.

222
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:10,041
Yes.

223
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:15,416
Dio... why are you doing this.

224
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,541
Quit you're yapping
and heal yourself.

225
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:21,041
Why do you want to fight...?

226
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:24,208
I don't see any reason for it.

227
00:19:24,291 --> 00:19:27,375
Well, there is a reason...

228
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,375
...but you wouldn't
understand...

229
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,833
...you see you've always
been one step ahead

230
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:34,541
of me our entire lives.

231
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:46,000
[Dio] But now, the reason
why is meaningless.

232
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:48,958
The only thing I desire
is to defeat you...

233
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,750
...and that...is all...

234
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:57,875
This single obsession... allowed
me to survive until recently.

235
00:19:57,958 --> 00:19:59,916
[piece of Dio falls in water]

236
00:20:02,083 --> 00:20:05,750
Have you not
been healed by Luna?

237
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:10,791
Why not?

238
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,875
[Dio] I believed if
I gained eternal life...

239
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:17,583
...this feeling of starvation
would fade away eventually...

240
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:20,291
...granting me inner peace.

241
00:20:20,375 --> 00:20:21,500
But if I can battle you

242
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:24,708
just once then I'll
forget about the ruin...

243
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:25,750
Fight me...

244
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:29,083
It's the only reason
I have to exist.

245
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,125
You know what...?

246
00:20:32,958 --> 00:20:34,041
You're no different than

247
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:37,833
the robots and humans
I've come across.

248
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,833
They all lived hard lives...

249
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,916
...to the fullest...

250
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,000
They have more life

251
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,625
in them than those
healed by Luna...

252
00:20:44,708 --> 00:20:46,500
...including myself.

253
00:20:50,041 --> 00:20:52,708
And you are the same...

254
00:20:52,791 --> 00:20:54,000
It's a mystery to me

255
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:57,750
why you'd think that
when you're ruining away.

256
00:20:57,833 --> 00:21:00,000
[Dio]
I don't understand.

257
00:21:00,083 --> 00:21:03,333
Well I'm not sure I do either...

258
00:21:03,416 --> 00:21:06,666
I don't understand
the idea of immortality...

259
00:21:06,750 --> 00:21:09,416
Same goes for... all the joys...

260
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,208
...and the fears
of life and death...

261
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:13,166
I don't get it...!

262
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,958
I never will!

263
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,333
Casshern...! If there is a
such a thing as a joy in life,

264
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:22,416
then fighting you is the
only joy that exists in mine!

265
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,416
Fighting me?

266
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:28,875
Now Casshern... Fight me.

267
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:40,750
[explosion]

268
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:45,041
[Casshern and Dio
wail as they fight]

269
00:21:47,458 --> 00:21:48,875
[Dio thinks]
This is it...

270
00:21:48,958 --> 00:21:52,041
I could never replicate this
feeling by living forever...

271
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:53,750
Now...

272
00:21:53,833 --> 00:21:55,666
[Casshern]
I can feel it...

273
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:57,708
This is Dio's...

274
00:23:34,791 --> 00:23:36,666
[Casshern]
In the face of death...

275
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:41,000
I learn about
the meaning of life.

276
00:23:41,083 --> 00:23:42,375
Next time...

277
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:45,333
Those Who Return.
