1
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:23,958
[Lyuze coughs]

2
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:28,375
[Casshern]
Are you alright...?

3
00:00:28,458 --> 00:00:30,708
Maybe we should rest.

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,041
[Lyuze]
No, I'll be fine.

5
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,125
[water rushing]

6
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:48,208
Woah...
What is that thing?

7
00:02:45,875 --> 00:02:47,208
[Ringo]
Ohji...!

8
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:50,833
There's a creepy little
thing crawling on my nose!

9
00:02:50,916 --> 00:02:52,791
[Ohji]
A creepy little thing...?

10
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:57,000
Oh right... you've never
seen a bug before have you?

11
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:58,333
[Ringo]
A bug...?

12
00:02:58,416 --> 00:02:59,833
That's what you call it?

13
00:02:59,916 --> 00:03:01,375
[buzz]

14
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:02,833
It flew away...!

15
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:05,875
Bye bye...! Mister Bug!

16
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,375
What is with this place?

17
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:13,916
What are flowers doing here?

18
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,625
[Ringo surprises]
Rar...!

19
00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:18,625
[Ringo laughs and then giggles]

20
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:20,291
Did I scare you?

21
00:03:20,375 --> 00:03:22,791
You maybe startled me a bit...

22
00:03:22,875 --> 00:03:23,708
[Lyuze laughs]

23
00:03:23,791 --> 00:03:25,166
[Lyuze]
Ringo, I have to ask...

24
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:27,291
What's going on with your face?

25
00:03:27,375 --> 00:03:29,375
[Lyuze]
You look like a clown!

26
00:03:29,458 --> 00:03:31,041
[Ringo giggles]

27
00:03:31,125 --> 00:03:33,416
[Lyuze] Hey Casshern...
look who I found...

28
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,375
Check out Ringo's new look.

29
00:03:35,458 --> 00:03:36,541
Ringo.

30
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,583
[Ringo continues to giggle]

31
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:53,333
[Robot bandit A]
Lord Dio!

32
00:03:53,416 --> 00:03:55,083
[Robot bandit B]
Long live Dio!

33
00:03:55,166 --> 00:03:57,833
[Robot bandit C] The world is
yours for the taking!

34
00:03:57,916 --> 00:04:00,916
[Robot bandit D] We'll follow
your every command Lord Dio!

35
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:05,250
[Leda] Why won't you
even acknowledge them...

36
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,333
Because they're nothing

37
00:04:06,416 --> 00:04:08,708
more than a mob
with self interests...

38
00:04:08,791 --> 00:04:11,041
They only pledge loyalty
to me because they

39
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:13,083
want to be saved.

40
00:04:13,416 --> 00:04:14,791
[Dio]
But I want more.

41
00:04:14,875 --> 00:04:17,041
[Dio] I want every living
being to worship me,

42
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,416
to bow before me in awe.

43
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:20,333
Don't you see?

44
00:04:20,416 --> 00:04:22,583
You already have that.

45
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,291
You're wrong...!

46
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,458
Casshern does!

47
00:04:27,541 --> 00:04:29,083
[Dio]
I must first defeat him...

48
00:04:29,166 --> 00:04:30,750
that must happen.

49
00:04:30,833 --> 00:04:32,458
Until then...

50
00:04:32,541 --> 00:04:34,791
I cannot become all powerful.

51
00:04:36,083 --> 00:04:40,291
Why are you letting
that get to you... Dio?

52
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:42,291
[Leda]
Just take a deep breath...

53
00:04:42,375 --> 00:04:44,208
You're blowing this all
out of proportion.

54
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:46,166
[Leda]
All is not lost.

55
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,291
[Robot bandit E] Lord Dio,
we have a problem!

56
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,833
[metal crashing]

57
00:04:55,916 --> 00:04:57,125
[Robot bandit E] This robot was
one of a group who left the

58
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:59,791
castle two days ago
in search of Luna.

59
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:02,208
So then what
happened to the others?

60
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,500
[Robot bandit E]
They're gone...

61
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:06,250
Apparently two unknown
robots defeated them all.

62
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:10,166
[Dio]
Who did this to you?

63
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,083
[Robot bandit F]
I'm sorry Lord Dio...

64
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,000
I didn't catch their names...

65
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:15,791
but they said
they knew where...

66
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:17,250
...to find Luna.

67
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:19,041
[metal smashing]

68
00:05:19,125 --> 00:05:22,708
Dio... Seize this opportunity...

69
00:05:22,791 --> 00:05:25,875
Destroy them and show
the world your strength.

70
00:05:26,791 --> 00:05:27,875
I see no benefit in

71
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:30,750
fighting unless
it's against Casshern.

72
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,541
[Leda thinks] Defeating
Casshern won't be easy...

73
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:42,708
Perhaps a quicker option
would be just to capture Luna.

74
00:05:42,791 --> 00:05:46,166
[Ringo giggles]

75
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,708
[Ringo] Ooh, Lyuze...!

76
00:05:47,791 --> 00:05:51,000
I want to give you
something really special!

77
00:05:51,083 --> 00:05:54,291
[Ringo] Here... Ohji took this
piece of broken glass and

78
00:05:54,375 --> 00:05:56,791
polished it up for me.

79
00:05:56,875 --> 00:05:58,625
[Ringo]
Isn't it pretty?

80
00:05:58,708 --> 00:05:59,708
But I don't want to take

81
00:05:59,791 --> 00:06:02,083
something that's
important to you.

82
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:03,250
[Ringo]
I don't mind...

83
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:05,833
Besides, I like the
flowers much better!

84
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:06,958
[Ringo giggles]

85
00:06:07,041 --> 00:06:08,458
[Ringo] When Ohji
gave it to me...

86
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:10,375
he said that when
you look through the glass,

87
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,791
you can see a whole
new and different world.

88
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:17,625
A world where there's no ruin...
sparkling in emeralds!

89
00:06:23,125 --> 00:06:25,333
[Lyuze]
A different world, huh?

90
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:28,666
Thanks Ringo...

91
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,541
I love it.

92
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:37,458
[Ringo playfully
giggles and laughs]

93
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:53,541
Ohji... I saw Ringo's arm
bleeding the other day...

94
00:06:53,625 --> 00:06:55,583
What's going on?

95
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:59,166
[Casshern] Is she a
human or something?

96
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,125
Do us a favor
and forget about it.

97
00:07:02,208 --> 00:07:03,208
Look Ohji...

98
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:06,291
I want to protect
Ringo and Lyuze...

99
00:07:06,375 --> 00:07:08,166
[Casshern]
Finding Luna...

100
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:12,916
...and saving those two from
ruin are all I care about.

101
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:15,333
[Ohji]
And why is that?

102
00:07:15,416 --> 00:07:18,333
[Casshern] I can't
explain it very well but...

103
00:07:18,416 --> 00:07:20,750
...recently for some reason...

104
00:07:20,833 --> 00:07:23,791
...those two have
become very special to me.

105
00:07:25,333 --> 00:07:26,708
I see.

106
00:07:28,416 --> 00:07:31,375
Special to you... huh?

107
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:37,666
[thud and rolling on the ground]

108
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:39,291
[Ohji]
I was an ideal employee,

109
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:42,583
following Braiking Boss'
orders to a T...

110
00:07:42,666 --> 00:07:47,083
But that loyalty indirectly
lead me to cause the ruin. 

111
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,041
[Ohji] In the aftermath,
I quickly spiraled into despair

112
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:52,083
and abandoned Braiking Boss...

113
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:55,708
...to wander the world
aimless and without purpose.

114
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:06,583
[Ohji grimacing]

115
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,958
[metal breaking and
Ohji screams]

116
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:26,500
[Ohji]
Is there any hope for

117
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:31,208
salvation in a world as
forsaken as this?

118
00:08:31,291 --> 00:08:32,958
[Ohji]
Everywhere I turned...

119
00:08:33,041 --> 00:08:35,291
I saw meaningless fighting...

120
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:37,833
Robots killing each
other for no reason.

121
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,833
[Ohji] The walking dead
waiting for the end.

122
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:45,541
[Ohji] Foolish robots massacring
weaker humans as if it

123
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,375
were some kind of sport,

124
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:51,291
life had become a silly game
to them and nothing more.

125
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:57,208
[Ohji] It was
truly a living hell.

126
00:08:57,291 --> 00:09:00,166
[Ohji] I no longer
held the will to live,

127
00:09:00,250 --> 00:09:03,083
let alone hope for
something better.

128
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:05,125
[Ohji cries out as he trips]

129
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:14,333
[Ohji] I fell into
a deep depression...

130
00:09:14,416 --> 00:09:18,833
...and the only way I
saw out of it was death.

131
00:09:18,916 --> 00:09:21,125
[Female voice] You
must go on living...

132
00:09:21,208 --> 00:09:23,083
Don't give in.

133
00:09:28,166 --> 00:09:31,166
[Baby Ringo cries]

134
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:42,833
[door being kicked]

135
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:47,166
[Baby Ringo continues to cry]

136
00:09:52,916 --> 00:09:55,291
[Ohji] I could hear through
that baby's cries someone

137
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,833
telling me to live...
and to not give in.

138
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:03,333
[Ohji yells]

139
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:06,000
[Metal crashing into
metal as Ohji cries out]

140
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:24,166
[Baby Ringo cries]

141
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,458
[Ohji]
I found her wrapped in

142
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,291
clothes a human
would wear,

143
00:10:28,375 --> 00:10:31,416
inside the shell of
a fallen robot.

144
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:38,000
[Ohji] Her earnest cries
defied the ruin to its core.

145
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,333
[Ohji]
A baby, alive and healthy,

146
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,291
in a world crumbling around her.

147
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:00,416
[Ohji]
It was a miracle...

148
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:04,250
...for her to have survived
such a living hell.

149
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,125
That is why...

150
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:17,750
...Ringo is a very
special person to me.

151
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,208
Amazing...

152
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,041
Two robots did this alone?

153
00:11:42,625 --> 00:11:44,958
[Vulcan] I had a feeling
you'd come here.

154
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,708
It's been quite awhile...

155
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,958
Lord Dio...and Leda.

156
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,666
[Leda]
Let's go.

157
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:55,791
[Leda] We're better off not
getting involved with them.

158
00:11:55,875 --> 00:12:00,041
[Vulcan] There's no need
to be rude... Lady Leda.

159
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:01,583
[Robot bandit E]
How disrespectful...

160
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:04,041
Who are those two?

161
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,708
[Leda] Before we even existed
there were two robots

162
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,458
who were considered 
the strongest in the Empire.

163
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,333
[Leda]
Vulcan and Mars...

164
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,875
You're looking at 'em.

165
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:16,958
[Robot bandit E] Talk about
relics from the past.

166
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:28,041
From the looks of it
you two seem to have

167
00:12:28,125 --> 00:12:31,625
been lying about
knowing were Luna is.

168
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:33,416
Just walk away.

169
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,750
[Vulcan]
We were...

170
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:39,000
It was all an attempt to
lure you from your castle.

171
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:41,458
[Mars] If it wasn't for you
and all your meddling Dio,

172
00:12:41,541 --> 00:12:44,041
we could have peacefully
succumbed to ruin by now.

173
00:12:44,125 --> 00:12:45,916
Having been known as the
strongest warriors

174
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,041
within the entire empire.

175
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:52,625
[Dio] And that's your
reasoning behind killing me?

176
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:54,833
[Vulcan] That and we
figured while we're at it...

177
00:12:54,916 --> 00:12:56,875
we might as well
take over the robotic army

178
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:01,000
you've been working
so hard to form.

179
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:04,041
[Dio] Fighting you two would
not only be a waste of my time,

180
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,000
it would be pointless.

181
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:11,250
[explosion]

182
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:43,833
[Dio cries out]

183
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,708
[Mars cries out]

184
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:52,208
That's enough.

185
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:55,291
[Leda] I will swear my
allegiance to you both...

186
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:58,166
As long as you promise
to spare his life!

187
00:14:00,458 --> 00:14:01,541
[Mars chuckles]

188
00:14:01,625 --> 00:14:03,666
Oh how can I refuse
when it's the lovely

189
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:06,458
Lady Leda begging me to?

190
00:14:06,541 --> 00:14:07,750
[Mars]
It's a deal...

191
00:14:07,833 --> 00:14:10,875
I take it you can guide
us to the castle then?

192
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,500
[Dio grimaces]

193
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:44,708
[water flowing]

194
00:14:47,375 --> 00:14:49,625
[Dio grimaces]

195
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,750
[Dio] Is that
you Braiking Boss?

196
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,958
[Braiking Boss] You
need to control yourself...

197
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:17,916
Here we are in a day
and age when robots

198
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,416
are being ruined by the
thousands and yet you still

199
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,916
insist on fighting
your own kind.

200
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,416
[Braiking Boss]
In the shape you're in now,

201
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,375
there isn't a chance in hell
you could defeat those two.

202
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,458
But why...?

203
00:15:30,541 --> 00:15:31,666
I don't understand...

204
00:15:31,750 --> 00:15:33,416
...please tell me!

205
00:15:33,500 --> 00:15:35,250
We are perfectly identical...

206
00:15:35,333 --> 00:15:37,375
...in both skills and specs...

207
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,750
So explain to me why
I'm inferior to Casshern!

208
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:48,000
[Braiking Boss] It's simple.
Casshern is a killing machine...

209
00:15:48,083 --> 00:15:50,916
He was the strongest
in the robotic army...

210
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,125
and was devoid of any

211
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:55,000
traces of emotion that
could hold him back.

212
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:57,916
[Braiking Boss] But the
Casshern of old is no more...

213
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,208
Now he possesses emotion,
much like a human being

214
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:04,083
who wears his
heart on his sleeve.

215
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,416
[Braiking Boss] He is finally
searching for his purpose in

216
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,125
life and is beginning
to understand

217
00:16:09,208 --> 00:16:11,833
what it is he must do.

218
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,916
[Braiking Boss]
He's protecting someone,

219
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,458
but it's been a struggle...

220
00:16:15,541 --> 00:16:18,958
and he's learning what it feels
like to be utterly helpless,

221
00:16:19,041 --> 00:16:21,375
and the terror
that goes with it...

222
00:16:21,458 --> 00:16:23,416
Just like a human.

223
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:27,750
It's the same with
those two dimwits.

224
00:16:27,833 --> 00:16:29,916
[Braiking Boss] Their goal
was not to defeat you,

225
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,833
but to make you afraid.

226
00:16:31,916 --> 00:16:33,875
[Braiking Boss] To make
you fear being ruined.

227
00:16:33,958 --> 00:16:36,875
[Braiking Boss]
To make you feel helpless.

228
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:41,750
[Braiking Boss]
On that day,

229
00:16:41,833 --> 00:16:44,916
the fate of both you
and Casshern was decided.

230
00:16:46,541 --> 00:16:48,583
[Dio]
What day was that?

231
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,833
[Braiking Boss]
The day he killed Luna...

232
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,541
Whether he wants it or not,
he must carry the

233
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,583
weight of destiny
on his shoulders.

234
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,666
Casshern is the sole person
responsible for turning

235
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,375
this world into a
wasteland of ruin...

236
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:05,625
He doesn't have this
obsessive fixation on

237
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,791
defeating a single person
like you do Dio.

238
00:17:10,625 --> 00:17:12,041
If I may be so blunt,

239
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,083
you can't even 
take care of yourself...

240
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,791
...let alone anyone else.

241
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,041
You will never have

242
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,083
what it takes to
defeat Casshern.

243
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:23,375
Don't ever utter that
name in my presence again!

244
00:17:23,458 --> 00:17:25,416
[water rippling]

245
00:18:13,541 --> 00:18:15,125
[explosion]

246
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:34,583
[Leda]
Dio!

247
00:18:34,666 --> 00:18:36,916
[Leda]
I knew you would save me!

248
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,833
[Vulcan]
In the Valley of Ruin,

249
00:19:30,916 --> 00:19:33,583
there's a stone that will
lead you to Luna.

250
00:19:33,666 --> 00:19:35,041
[Vulcan]
Just north of the lake...

251
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:37,333
Now please, save me.

252
00:19:39,875 --> 00:19:42,291
Aren't you gonna
finish him off?

253
00:19:42,375 --> 00:19:43,541
What's the point...?

254
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,708
There's no way he could

255
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:48,500
ever defeat me
without Mars helping him.

256
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,208
[Dio] Let the ruin
take care of him.

257
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,250
[Vulcan]
Braiking Boss!?

258
00:20:05,333 --> 00:20:09,833
Well it looks like Mars
was defeated rather easily.

259
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,458
[Vulcan]
Damn you...

260
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:14,000
Why did you create
Dio and the others...?

261
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:17,500
Why did you abandon us?

262
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:21,958
[Vulcan]
Why Braiking Boss, why?

263
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:23,125
That's good...

264
00:20:23,208 --> 00:20:25,416
Show me how mad you are.

265
00:20:32,083 --> 00:20:33,375
[Vulcan cries out]

266
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,458
[metal breaking and
Vulcan cries out]

267
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:48,000
Those last few years
must have been tough...

268
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:50,625
Now you can rest easy.

269
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:05,791
Ohji...! Come here!

270
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,333
It says it's a stone

271
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:14,666
that has the power
to heal people.

272
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:15,833
It's Luna...!

273
00:21:15,916 --> 00:21:18,041
It must mean that
she's been here before!

274
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,500
I can feel a breeze
coming from inside.

275
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,375
Is that right?

276
00:21:24,833 --> 00:21:26,625
[Ohji]
There's stairs.

277
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:40,791
[Ringo laughs]

278
00:21:47,583 --> 00:21:51,500
I wish these peaceful
days could go on... forever.

279
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,666
[Casshern] A past which
cannot be erased...

280
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:38,041
is resurrected along

281
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,041
with a horde of
appalling memories.

282
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:44,083
[Casshern] Next time...
The Glass Cradle.
