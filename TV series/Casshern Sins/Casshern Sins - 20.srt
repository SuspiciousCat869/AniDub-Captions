00:00:25,458 --> 00:00:29,041
[Luna] Do you know why
the flowers bloom?

[Dune grunts]

4
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:34,333
They bloom in order
to make everyone happy...

5
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,583
Because when a flower is
at its most beautiful

6
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,541
it can bring a smile
to anyone's face.

May you have...
eternal healing too.

00:03:16,833 --> 00:03:19,541
Are those Luna's flowers...?

10
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,583
Luna's scent?

00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,666
[Dune]
Finally... My homeland...

12
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,958
Luna!

13
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,750
Dune? Is that you?

14
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,125
[Dune] Miss Luna...
my humblest

15
00:03:55,208 --> 00:03:59,208
apologies for being away
from your side for so long.

16
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,833
[Luna] It's good
to see you again...

17
00:04:01,916 --> 00:04:06,041
The flowers have
welcomed you as well.

18
00:04:06,125 --> 00:04:09,750
Why thank you... our sun.

19
00:04:09,833 --> 00:04:11,833
Come Dune...

20
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:16,291
Let me grant you
healing and peace.

Our precious and
endearing light...I'm...

22
00:04:19,375 --> 00:04:22,958
...happy... just to see you.

23
00:04:50,083 --> 00:04:51,166
Is this really the city

24
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,916
Luna's supposed to
be staying in...?

25
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:57,000
Has she saved anyone?

26
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:01,250
Let's hope.

27
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:04,791
But... I wonder if
she hurts like the others...

28
00:05:04,875 --> 00:05:07,166
Could Luna be suffering to?

29
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:14,125
Ohji told me one time...

30
00:05:14,208 --> 00:05:17,583
...that Luna heals the weak
by spilling her own blood...

31
00:05:17,666 --> 00:05:18,791
...and because of that

32
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:22,125
she can only heal so
many people at a time.

33
00:05:24,083 --> 00:05:26,333
I hope it doesn't hurt her.

So that's... Luna?

She's so pretty.

I can hardly believe he
was able to make it this far.

Yeah.

43
00:06:28,791 --> 00:06:30,875
Is he your friend?

He shares the
same dream with us.

45
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,500
Well if that's the case...

46

[Casshern]
I see you made it.

51
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:08,250
Only because you
allowed me to live...

52
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,916
I wanted to kill you...

53

...but you were kind
enough to spare me.

54

So have you... seen Luna?

55
00:07:16,833 --> 00:07:18,416
I have...

56
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:23,916
May Luna's grace be with you.

57
00:07:44,541 --> 00:07:47,166
Wow, there are so many of them.

down there, Ringo?

know about this?

not ever give...

take from it selfishly.

sticking it out

[Casshern]
That's not true!

167
00:18:52,958 --> 00:18:55,000
For all the beings that
inhabit this world...

168
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:57,041
each and every one
of them lives for something

169
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:59,458
with every breath they take.

170
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,125
That's the most
important thing...

171
00:19:03,208 --> 00:19:07,416
I've learned on this
journey of mine.

172
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,166
But I am content with...

173
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,416
...just being a flower...

174
00:19:12,500 --> 00:19:15,750
Blooming and withering away.

175
00:19:17,333 --> 00:19:19,875
[Dune]
That's all I ever needed.

176
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,791
[Dune exhales]

177
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,208
Dune!

178
00:19:30,791 --> 00:19:32,166
No!

179
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,625
[gust of wind]

180
00:19:53,958 --> 00:19:56,250
[robot guardian] Hey...
Who are you?

181
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,166
[Braiking Boss groans]

182
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:02,500
Correct me if I'm wrong

183
00:20:02,583 --> 00:20:05,500
but you look too well off
to be in a graveyard.

184
00:20:05,583 --> 00:20:07,958
Then why are you here?

185
00:20:08,041 --> 00:20:10,500
I am its protector.

186
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:13,458
[Braiking Boss] Perhaps a friend
of yours is interred here?

187
00:20:13,541 --> 00:20:15,875
Afraid not I just
happened to drift here...

188
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,250
...but after spending some
time with these graves...

189
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:19,708
...I decided it'd be best if

190
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,500
I stayed until the
world fell into ruin.

191
00:20:22,583 --> 00:20:24,583
And why is that?

192
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,166
It makes me feel better...
knowing that there

193
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,000
are so many who were
destroyed before me.

194
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,708
[robot guardian] From what I can
tell this used to be the site

195
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:35,208
of a military base...

196
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:38,083
...operated by a guy
named Braiking Boss...

197
00:20:38,166 --> 00:20:41,625
I've heard these are the
graves of his own men.

198
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,708
[robot guardian] Strange guy,
if you ask me...

199
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,458
I mean why would he
have to dig so many graves?

200
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,083
I know why...

201
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,333
[Braiking Boss] He
probably didn't want to

202
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:55,000
forget the amount of
lives the ruin claimed.

203
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:57,708
He wanted their memories
to live on so he carved

204
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,791
the massive loss
of life into his heart.

205
00:21:04,750 --> 00:21:06,375
[robot henchman C]
Lady Leda! I found someone

206
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:09,416
who claims to know
where Luna's hiding!

207
00:21:14,166 --> 00:21:16,125
[Leda chuckles]

208
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,000
[Casshern]
Luna.

209
00:21:24,250 --> 00:21:26,375
Oh... Hi, Casshern.

210
00:21:26,458 --> 00:21:27,666
All these rumors that

211
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,791
you can heal the sick
are nothing but lies...

212
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:33,208
From what I've seen
you haven't saved anyone.

213
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:34,375
It makes no difference

214
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,583
because everyone will
die without me,

215
00:21:36,666 --> 00:21:37,750
giving off a pungent...

216
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,625
deplorable stench.

217
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:50,000
[Casshern thinks] What I felt
at the end of my journey...

218
00:21:51,750 --> 00:21:54,458
...was neither hope
for the future...

219
00:21:54,541 --> 00:21:57,791
...nor despair for the dead...

220
00:21:57,875 --> 00:22:01,666
But pure anger.

221
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:36,291
[Casshern] What we found at
the end of our journey

222
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,041
was not truth...

223
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:42,083
...but an illusion
disguised as hope.

224
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:43,625
Next time...

225
00:23:43,708 --> 00:23:46,916
The Paradise of Lost Hope.
