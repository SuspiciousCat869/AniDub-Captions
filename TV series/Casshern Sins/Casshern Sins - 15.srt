[rock breaks]

I don't remember...

00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:32,000
What was I trying
to grab that day...?

18
00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:34,833
Who was it...

19
00:03:34,916 --> 00:03:36,291
Who?

20
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,541
Hey there...

21
00:03:54,625 --> 00:03:56,625
You sure you're alright?

22
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:00,875
[Lyuze]
I'm glad if you are.

23
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,416
[Casshern]
I haven't said a word.

24
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,625
Some things don't
need to be said...

25
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,541
...in order for them
to be understood.

26
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,458
Come on...

27
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:17,666
There's nothing for us here.
Let's move on.

I'm okay...

[Lyuze laughs]

33
00:04:42,333 --> 00:04:43,916
Thanks for that.

34
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:49,000
Just took a little
tumble, that's all.

35
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:56,500
[Lyuze] It's bizarre having you
of all people worrying about me.

36
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,041
When I'm the one

37
00:04:59,125 --> 00:05:01,541
who's supposed to
be following you.

[fragment skitters

00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:12,083
[Casshern] Looks like
they came through here

40
00:05:12,166 --> 00:05:14,333
but couldn't go any further.

41
00:05:14,416 --> 00:05:16,916
The landscape is dry

42
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,125
they weren't able to
make it out alive...

43
00:05:19,208 --> 00:05:22,916
This hard pan is
a robotic graveyard.

44
00:05:23,666 --> 00:05:25,166
Never thought I'd hear
empathy coming out

45
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:27,041
of your mouth, Casshern.

46
00:05:28,791 --> 00:05:32,541
[Lyuze]] All these robots will
be able to rest in peace now...

47
00:05:32,625 --> 00:05:35,666
Knowing someone out
there actually cared.

48
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,333
Is something wrong?

49
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:56,000
You see that black
mound out there?

[sound of shattering rocks]

51
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:21,583
Is he dead?

[shattering]

53
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,666
No... Not yet.

54
00:06:33,208 --> 00:06:36,291
Well... it doesn't look
like he has much longer.

55

[Dune grunts]

56
00:06:52,416 --> 00:06:54,458
[Dune]
I cannot die...

57
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,625
Not until this hand...
grabs something.

58
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:03,500
He wants to live.

59
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,500
Yes... He's trying his best.

60
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:09,541

[Dune groans as he struggles]

64
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,000
[Lyuze]
He's lucky...

65
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,750
To have someone by
his side in the

66
00:07:32,833 --> 00:07:36,291
middle of this wasteland.

67
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:37,750
[Lyuze]
Still...

68
00:07:40,958 --> 00:07:42,041
I wonder...

69
00:07:42,125 --> 00:07:45,583
What exactly is it
he's trying to grasp...?

70
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:48,083
Just who is it that's...

71
00:07:48,166 --> 00:07:50,541
...inspiring him to live?

72
00:07:57,208 --> 00:08:03,250
Life... has an inherent desire
to survive... at all costs.

73
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:05,125
He has a soul.

74
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,666
And that soul...

75
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:11,875
will not allow him
to die so easily.

76
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:19,500
Lyuze... You should get
some rest while you can.

77
00:08:19,583 --> 00:08:21,541
I think I'll be alright.

78
00:08:23,333 --> 00:08:24,958
The more I get to know you...

79
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:27,958
...the harder you
are to understand.

80
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:29,166
I used to think...

81
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:30,708
you had no soul...

82
00:08:30,791 --> 00:08:34,208
that your only purpose in life
was to fight and destroy.

83
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:39,583
You know... I hardly
understand it myself...

84
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,958
It's just...

85
00:08:42,041 --> 00:08:45,333
Perhaps people tend
to develop their weaknesses...

86
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:48,708
...when they protect someone
other than themselves.

87
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,958
Someone to... protect.

88

[Ringo laughs]

89
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:11,875
Doesn't it feel great... Ohji?!

90
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,416
Sure does.

91
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:17,041
I feel like I can do
anything I want today!

92
00:09:17,125 --> 00:09:18,291
Oh yeah...?

93
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:20,500
So what do you want to do?

94
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:22,291
[Ringo ponders]
Hmm...

95
00:09:22,375 --> 00:09:24,375
What about you?

96
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,875
Well I don't know...

97
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:28,458
[Ohji]
Hmm...

98
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:30,208
[Ringo playfully]
Hmm...

[Ringo and Ohji
playfully "hmm" back and forth]

100
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,958
Ringo, hold on?

101
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:46,750
It's okay Ohji, I'm fine!

102
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:50,250
But... Doesn't it hurt
whenever you do that?

103
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,250
No, not really...

104
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,958
I love the feeling
of this wind!

105
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,541
Ringo.

106
00:10:15,125 --> 00:10:18,458
I feel... a whole lot better
when I'm not wearing it...

107
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:21,500
...even though it is
harder to breathe.

108
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:27,458
[Ringo laughs]

109
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:28,708
[Ohji thinks] I want
to do everything

110
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:32,875
I possibly can to
provide for you.

111
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:37,500
[Ohji thinks] That is
my one and only wish.

112
00:10:37,583 --> 00:10:38,291
[Ringo laughs]

113
00:10:38,375 --> 00:10:40,583
Doesn't it feel good Ohji?

114
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:49,333
Did he die?

115
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,750
[Dune]
I must go on.

116
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,458
[Dune]
I want to live.

117
00:11:11,166 --> 00:11:13,958
[Dune] I want to hold
something in my hands...

118
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:16,000
...and feel its warmth.

119
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,375
[Lyuze]
Hold something...?

120
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,083
What exactly?

121
00:11:23,208 --> 00:11:25,833
I wish I knew.

122
00:11:25,916 --> 00:11:29,375
[thud]
[Dune groans]

123
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:31,750
I don't understand.

124
00:11:31,833 --> 00:11:34,833
Why even try to move on...?

125
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,958
How do you work
up the desire...

126
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:41,708
...when you don't even
know where the path leads?

127
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:46,625
[Dune yells]

128
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,250
Dune?

129
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,875
You know this guy?

130
00:12:03,958 --> 00:12:05,708
He was a guard...

131
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:09,041
...who protected Luna...
with my sister.

132
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,000
Him... really?

133
00:12:12,833 --> 00:12:14,208
[Lyuze]
Yeah.

134
00:12:15,875 --> 00:12:18,000
He was so feared
it was said that if you

135
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,333
even looked at him...

136
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,458
...you would die an
instantaneous death,

137
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:24,500
just from the
sight of him alone.

138
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,875
The God of Death...

139
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,333
...Dune.

140
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:36,708
So the God of Death
actually... protected Luna.

141
00:12:36,791 --> 00:12:38,333
[Lyuze]
He loved Luna...

142
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:41,625
...more than anyone
else that ever lived.

143
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:03,791
He guarded her fearlessly...

144
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,541
The God of Death... Dune.

145
00:13:09,250 --> 00:13:12,166
[Casshern]
So there was someone.

146
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,125
Just one person...

147
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:15,458
One being who was still

148
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:18,375
standing after I
annihilated the world...

149
00:13:18,458 --> 00:13:20,416
after I destroyed Luna.

150
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:32,333
[Lyuze] I have a feeling he's
still trying to protect

151
00:13:32,416 --> 00:13:34,375
Luna even now.

Really?

That's Casshern?

you to walk away.

[Robot bandit B]
Kill him!

170
00:15:02,458 --> 00:15:04,083
[Dune]
Casshern.

171
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,541
[Dune]
Lady Luna!

172
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:32,875
I am the one...
called Casshern.

173
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,250
Casshern.

174

out after being hit]

[thud]

176
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,833
Luna!

[explosion]

00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,625
[Dune gulps]

179
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:08,750
My Dune.

180
00:16:12,416 --> 00:16:15,666
[Luna]
You are no God of Death...

181
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:18,416
You are my Guardian Angel.

182
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,041
Dune... Live on...

183
00:16:44,958 --> 00:16:46,333
Dune.

184
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,708
[Dune]
You're my enemy!

185
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,375
[Lyuze cries out]

186
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,000

[thud]

190
00:17:06,708 --> 00:17:07,583
Casshern...

191
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,041
You are my enemy...!

192
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:11,791
My nemesis...! Luna's killer!

193
00:17:11,875 --> 00:17:13,458
[slicing dings]

194
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,625
[Dune]
My scourge!

195
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:21,083
[impact]

196
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:29,291
[slicing dings, fighting
and explosions]

197
00:17:45,791 --> 00:17:47,166
There's no point in fighting!

198
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:49,208
Both of you stop it!

199
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,458
Lady Luna!

200
00:17:58,166 --> 00:18:01,625
But why...? You were lucky
enough to survive the ruin...

201
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:05,541
What reason could you
possibly have to fight anymore?

202
00:18:07,041 --> 00:18:08,833
Why...? Dune...

203
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:21,291
[Dune groans loudly in pain]

204
00:18:21,375 --> 00:18:22,958
[thud]

205
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:30,916
[Dune]
Lady Luna.

206
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:49,708
More people are praying...

207
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:53,458
...they will come to me
today in hopes of survival.

208
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:11,083
So too... will those who
have accepted their ruin.

209
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,625
[Dune groans]

210
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,000
I won't forgive you.

211
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:30,958
[Dune groans]

212
00:19:31,041 --> 00:19:32,208
That's enough, Dune...

213
00:19:32,291 --> 00:19:35,625
Stop...! Please...

214
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:40,500
You don't have...
to protect her anymore...

215
00:19:40,583 --> 00:19:42,541
Because.

216
00:19:42,625 --> 00:19:45,125
The Luna you
devoted your life to...

217
00:19:45,208 --> 00:19:47,458
...isn't actually dead...

218
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,500
She is alive.

219
00:19:53,208 --> 00:19:58,458
Lady Luna... is alive?

220
00:19:58,541 --> 00:20:00,833
[Lyuze]
Yes, very much so...

221
00:20:00,916 --> 00:20:03,875
She's living somewhere
beyond these plains.

222
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:11,875
[Luna]
Don't cry, Dune...

223
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:15,125
It's imperative I live...

224
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:18,625
...for the sake of everyone
who has perished.

225
00:20:21,708 --> 00:20:23,500
[Dune]
Lady Luna.

226
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,291
[Dune]
What I tried to grasp...

227
00:20:27,375 --> 00:20:30,875
...that day so long ago...

228
00:20:30,958 --> 00:20:32,916
...wasn't you, Casshern.

229
00:20:39,208 --> 00:20:43,166
[Dune] What my now
withered hand sought was...

230
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,125
...Lady Luna.

231
00:21:05,166 --> 00:21:06,416
[Ringo]
Guess what, Ohji...

232
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:07,666
[Ohji]
What's that?

233
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,875
[Ringo] I know what
I want to do now!

234
00:21:10,958 --> 00:21:15,916
I want to make your most
desired wish come true!

235
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:21,666
[Ohji]
Is that right...?

236
00:21:21,750 --> 00:21:24,375
That makes me very happy.

237
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:30,458
[Lyuze] You said that people
tend to develop weakness

238
00:21:30,541 --> 00:21:35,125
whenever they must protect
someone other than themselves...

239
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:37,166
[Lyuze]
I think you're wrong.

240
00:21:39,208 --> 00:21:42,250
When you have
someone to protect...

241
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:44,291
...you become compassionate.

242
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,958
[Casshern] What
people seek when the

243
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,166
depths of despair and
death are upon them...

244
00:21:55,250 --> 00:21:59,625
...may be the silhouettes
of the ones they love.

245
00:23:34,458 --> 00:23:36,458
[Casshern] In order
for one to exist...

246
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:37,583
there is always someone

247
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,625
nearby in need
of their protection.

248
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,833
Next time...

249
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,125
For the Strength to Believe.
