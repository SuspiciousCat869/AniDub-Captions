1
00:00:09,208 --> 00:00:12,166
Murder... Luna.

2
00:00:14,333 --> 00:00:17,458
[Braiking Boss] But... now that
she has ended the ruin...

3
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:21,208
she's afforded a life that
eternity could never match.

4
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:31,166
Hello I'm Luna...
I shall... grant you healing..

5
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:33,625
Now... Come.

6
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:37,583
[Braiking Boss]
Is this a coincidence...

7
00:00:37,666 --> 00:00:40,291
...or is this
the will of God...?

8
00:00:42,583 --> 00:00:43,958
Or...

9
00:00:46,333 --> 00:00:48,125
[robot refugee A]
Lady Luna!

10
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:59,875
[Braiking Boss] Has the
world really been saved?

11
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,750
[Luna lightly gasps]

12
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,333
Friender...
I know what I'm doing...

13
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:51,583
Just gonna take a peek...

14
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:54,833
It's the smell...
I recognize it from somewhere.

15
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,416
[Friender howls]

16
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:09,208
[Ringo laughs]

17
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:14,333
Gorgeous!

18
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:19,333
[Ringo thinks] I wish I could
show this to Ohji and Lyuze.

19
00:03:30,166 --> 00:03:31,791
These will all bloom again...

20
00:03:31,875 --> 00:03:33,666
...for next season.

21
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,625
I have to admit,
I never would have

22
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:38,791
imagined you to have
a knack for raising flowers.

23
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,833
Yeah well I'm just
as surprised as you are.

24
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,125
[Lyuze]
When I first started,

25
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,083
all I was doing was
giving Ringo a hand...

26
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:53,208
but I've found it
to be a lot of fun...

27
00:03:53,291 --> 00:03:55,250
We're talking about
turning the entire area

28
00:03:55,333 --> 00:03:57,958
into a field of flowers.

29
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:00,791
And I'm hoping to add...

30
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:03,166
...some more colors.

31
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,458
Really...?

32
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,875
How would you do that?

33
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:10,000
Ohji's researching
some fertilizers.

34
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,541
Oh yeah?

35
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,541
I see... I guess that's why

36
00:04:24,625 --> 00:04:27,291
he's been locked away in
his room so much lately.

37
00:04:27,375 --> 00:04:30,000
He would try to change
the color of the sky...

38
00:04:30,083 --> 00:04:33,125
...as long as he knew it
would make Ringo happy.

39
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:47,875
[Lyuze groans lightly]
[metal disintegrating]

40
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:54,208
Lyuze!

41
00:04:56,541 --> 00:04:58,125
[Lyuze]
I'm okay.

42
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,208
[Ringo]
Lyuze!

43
00:05:12,125 --> 00:05:14,083
[Ringo out of breath]

44
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,791
Ringo.

45
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,875
Guess what I found!

46
00:05:26,041 --> 00:05:27,625
Just on the other
side of the cliff...

47
00:05:27,708 --> 00:05:28,875
There's a sea...!

48
00:05:28,958 --> 00:05:31,333
The water's so
sparkly and pretty...!

49
00:05:31,416 --> 00:05:35,708
I can't wait to
show you two... Hey, Ohji!!

50
00:05:35,791 --> 00:05:39,708
It's been awhile...
since I've been to the sea.

51
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:47,041
[Casshern]
Let's go... Shall we?

52
00:05:48,083 --> 00:05:50,166
[Ringo]
Ohji! I found the sea...!

53
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:52,166
The sea, the sea, the sea!!

54
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:57,166
I'm so... happy.

55
00:06:00,875 --> 00:06:02,875
[Ringo laughs]

56
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,250
[Ohji]
That sweet girl...

57
00:06:26,333 --> 00:06:29,291
...it's as if she's forgotten
all about the ruin.

58
00:06:31,291 --> 00:06:34,458
[Ohji sighs]

59
00:06:34,541 --> 00:06:35,750
[Ringo crying]

60
00:06:35,833 --> 00:06:38,791
[Ohji] But... none of
that matters anymore.

61
00:06:46,458 --> 00:06:48,875
[Ohji] How long have
we been here...?

62
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:51,833
I've had such a
good time of late...

63
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:54,583
it's hard for me to remember.

64
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:59,541
[Ohji] To be honest,
I feel like kicking myself

65
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:03,208
for dragging her around
the wastelands like I did,

66
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,833
putting her in danger.

67
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,958
[Ohji] I never thought doing
these little projects for her

68
00:07:11,041 --> 00:07:15,750
could make me so... so...

69
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:20,416
Make me so happy...

70
00:07:29,083 --> 00:07:30,458
Gorgeous.

71
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,708
[Lyuze] Since the four of us
have been living together,

72
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,666
not a day has passed
where I haven't found

73
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:50,750
something that's made
me truly happy...

74
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,625
This is the first time in
my life I've felt this way.

75
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,666
Looking back I'm really
glad I didn't kill you...

76
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:01,250
It would've been a mistake.

77
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,791
[Ringo laughs]

78
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:19,000
[Ringo]
Ohji, I'm gonna make

79
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,958
your workshop smell
just like the sea!

80
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,791
You're gonna love it...!

81
00:08:22,875 --> 00:08:24,250
And if these aren't enough

82
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:27,708
I'll bring more 'cause
there's plenty to choose from...

83
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:30,750
Friender said he'd
help me carry them. 

84
00:08:34,458 --> 00:08:36,750
[Ringo] The fertilizer you're
making is gonna help all the

85
00:08:36,833 --> 00:08:39,125
flowers bloom
some friends, right?

86
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,958
And lots of
different colors too!

87
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:48,208
I can't wait...!
They'll be so pretty!

88
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:52,458
[Ringo]
Hey Ohji...

89
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,541
What's your favorite color...?

90
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,375
Mine's definitely green...

91
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,625
Or, maybe Casshern's red...

92
00:09:00,708 --> 00:09:05,958
But I also really like
the color of Lyuze's hair.

93
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,333
[Ringo]
More than anything

94
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,166
I love being
held by you, Ohji...

95
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,958
It's the best
feeling in the world.

96
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:22,666
[Luna in a panicked voice]
No...! Get back!

97
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:25,541
Lady Luna... heal me!

98
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,458
[metal ding]

99
00:09:34,125 --> 00:09:37,125
No... Keep the ruin
away from me...!

100
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,958
Anything that carries death
must be destroyed...!

101
00:09:40,041 --> 00:09:41,875
No exceptions!

102
00:09:41,958 --> 00:09:43,541
[robot refugee]
Luna!!

103
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,958
[multiple metal slicing]

104
00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,125
[Luna]
Eternal life...

105
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,208
Please come quickly...

106
00:09:52,291 --> 00:09:54,791
I must eradicate this death.

107
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:57,625
[Braiking Boss]
You've gone too far, Luna...

108
00:09:57,708 --> 00:10:00,666
I thought you were
going to stop the ruin.

109
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:07,083
[Luna] A long time ago...
I was forced to grant death.

110
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:10,625
[Luna]
Day after day...

111
00:10:10,708 --> 00:10:13,083
I murdered...

112
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,166
At night I would
hear them cry...

113
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:19,666
...wailing and suffering.

114
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:21,125
It is wholly unnatural

115
00:10:21,208 --> 00:10:24,666
for those who are
given life to die...

116
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:29,875
For death is an impure evil...
and I must destroy it.

117
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:34,458
But... ending the
ruin is... death...

118
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,833
You may not realize it

119
00:10:35,916 --> 00:10:39,625
but you are still spreading
death like you used to.

120
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:45,875
[Luna]
Yes, temporarily...

121
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:47,333
But once it's over,

122
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:50,458
death will disappear from
this world like it should...

123
00:10:50,541 --> 00:10:54,375
...and then eternal life
will begin anew.

124
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:57,250
Luna.

125
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:06,833
[Casshern] I think you
and Ringo have gone too far.

126
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,583
Nah... You know,

127
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,666
Ohji did make it
especially for Ringo...

128
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:14,583
What we have
isn't nearly enough...

129
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:16,625
We need to keep planting.

130
00:11:23,291 --> 00:11:26,541
[Lyuze] Thing is, it's getting
harder for me to walk.

131
00:11:31,333 --> 00:11:33,291
[Lyuze gasps as she falls]

132
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,583
Lyuze no!

133
00:11:43,083 --> 00:11:44,125
[Casshern]
Hang in there...!

134
00:11:44,208 --> 00:11:46,083
Don't you die!

135
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,583
I don't want to...
die either.

136
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,833
Casshern... Remember when
I told you that every day

137
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:06,958
I'd found something that
made me truly happy?

138
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,750
Today it's this...

139
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:14,166
I was able to think
"I don't want to die."

140
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:23,791
I think I've...
lived my life to the fullest...

141
00:12:23,875 --> 00:12:26,833
It's been... the best.

142
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,708
Lyuze.

143
00:12:48,333 --> 00:12:51,291
[Casshern begins to cry]
[Ringo continues to cry]

144
00:12:57,083 --> 00:12:58,500
[thunder cracks]

145
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:20,875
Very soon...
the ruin will disappear...

146
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,916
Soon the eternal world...

147
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,708
[Luna]
Casshern.

148
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,166
Casshern is coming.

149
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,833
[thunder cracks]

150
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:22,208
[battle cries]

151
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:25,625
[robot bandit A]
Casshern...!

152
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:28,583
Why did you come here?!

153
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:32,625
[fighting and yelling]

154
00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:26,833
[Casshern]
If you have forgotten death...

155
00:15:29,041 --> 00:15:30,125
Then why have you

156
00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:33,208
also forgotten what it
means to be alive?

157
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,000
[Casshern]
I will...

158
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
So much death...

159
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,250
It must end soon...

160
00:16:14,333 --> 00:16:17,625
Casshern is...
the bringer of death.

161
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:19,500
I hate it.

162
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:02,375
[Braiking Boss] Do you
intend to kill Luna?

163
00:17:05,041 --> 00:17:08,333
[Braiking Boss] What made
you change your mind?

164
00:17:11,333 --> 00:17:12,583
At this point...

165
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,791
...there's no sense in
fighting you anymore...

166
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,375
However I bear the
responsibility for those

167
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,291
I have brought here.

168
00:17:20,375 --> 00:17:21,625
[Braiking Boss chuckles]

169
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:25,125
Sorry but I can't let you pass.

170
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:36,250
You haven't...
received her healing?

171
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,791
[Braiking Boss]
Apparently not...

172
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,333
It's time we fought, Casshern.

173
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,125
[Luna]
Kill him...

174
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,583
Hurry, do it quickly!

175
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,166
If answers are all
you are looking for,

176
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:02,291
then I'm afraid this is
all I can offer you.

177
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:04,333
[Braiking Boss laughs]

178
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:10,916
[Braiking Boss builds
to a battle cry]

179
00:18:51,250 --> 00:18:55,916
Casshern... both you and Luna...

180
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,916
This may be the price which
we must pay for interfering

181
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:01,958
with the intricacies
of life and death.

182
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,791
[Braiking Boss] Due to
both of your actions...

183
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,250
...the world has gone mad.

184
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,666
[Braiking Boss]
Will it return to normal?

185
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:24,458
The only one who
really knows... is God.

186
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:38,583
[Braiking Boss]
My... I certainly created

187
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,875
one hell of a
killing machine...

188
00:19:42,500 --> 00:19:47,666
That face... I don't
know what you plan on doing...

189
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:50,416
but I can only assume it's
your own way of settling

190
00:19:50,500 --> 00:19:52,458
your debt to the world.

191
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,125
[Braiking Boss]
Casshern...

192
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:58,791
Kill Luna once and for all.

193
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:06,125
As I lay here dying...

194
00:20:06,208 --> 00:20:10,250
...I can only hope I have
atoned for my own sins.

195
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:12,291
[Braiking Boss chuckles]

196
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,666
Casshern.

197
00:20:34,708 --> 00:20:41,375
No... ruin's coming...
and death.

198
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:48,583
Luna.

199
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:55,416
[Luna] The living bear
the stench of death.

200
00:20:57,916 --> 00:21:00,333
The mere fact they are alive
means they will meet a

201
00:21:00,416 --> 00:21:02,541
senseless and ugly death...

202
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:06,375
But... that shouldn't be...?

203
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:07,541
I... want to grant them

204
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:09,333
eternal life so
they may avoid it!

205
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,791
Luna.

206
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:18,083
Outta my way!

207
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,750
[thunder cracks]

208
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,041
That day...

209
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:35,666
...do you remember
what happened?

210
00:21:35,750 --> 00:21:36,666
It was...

211
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:39,208
The blood of life and death...

212
00:21:39,291 --> 00:21:41,416
[Luna and Casshern together]
Mixed together...

213
00:21:41,500 --> 00:21:42,875
{Casshern]
The world...

214
00:21:42,958 --> 00:21:44,750
[Luna]
The world...

215
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:46,416
[Luna and Casshern together]
Changed.

216
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,583
[Luna] You aren't
going to kill me?

217
00:21:55,666 --> 00:21:58,166
[Casshern]
No, I won't...

218
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,958
There are still individuals
who seek you out,

219
00:22:01,041 --> 00:22:02,833
in search of life...

220
00:22:02,916 --> 00:22:05,416
It is your duty to help them.

221
00:22:07,166 --> 00:22:12,000
And... it's okay if
I grant them eternal life?

222
00:22:12,083 --> 00:22:14,375
[Casshern] If survival
is what they want,

223
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:16,750
then it's better
if they have it...

224
00:22:16,833 --> 00:22:19,375
I cannot deny them that...

225
00:22:19,458 --> 00:22:20,833
However...

226
00:22:22,916 --> 00:22:24,000
If you...

227
00:22:24,083 --> 00:22:27,333
...or anyone forgets
the face of death...

228
00:22:27,416 --> 00:22:29,375
...then I will return.

229
00:22:40,625 --> 00:22:42,875
[thunder cracks followed
by Casshern screaming]

230
00:22:47,708 --> 00:22:51,000
[older Ringo] Casshern
was never seen again...

231
00:22:53,625 --> 00:22:55,583
He became death for
those who will never

232
00:22:55,666 --> 00:22:59,250
know what it means to die.

233
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:08,333
[older Ringo]
As for me...

234
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:10,791
I became the first to live
a life where death

235
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,458
wasn't an option,

236
00:23:12,541 --> 00:23:15,916
but a reality that one must
face in the future.

237
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,250
[older Ringo] When every life in
the world becomes like mine...

238
00:23:30,583 --> 00:23:33,375
I'll get to see
Casshern again!

239
00:23:40,041 --> 00:23:41,833
[older Ringo]
And until then...

240
00:23:41,916 --> 00:23:45,166
...I will continue, to live.
