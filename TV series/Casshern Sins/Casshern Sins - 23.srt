00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,625
[cracking]

00:00:11,291 --> 00:00:15,000
[metal clanging with impact]

3
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:16,250
[Braiking Boss]
What is this...?

4
00:00:16,333 --> 00:00:19,500
Have you all run
out of strength?

5
00:00:19,583 --> 00:00:20,916
[robot henchman A]
I'm fine...

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,291
If I follow behind you,
the ruin will end...

7
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:27,541
isn't that right, Braiking Boss?

8
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,875
Is that so?

9
00:00:31,958 --> 00:00:33,750
[Braiking Boss chuckles]

10
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:36,125
[Braiking Boss]
Well...

11
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:44,541
I will never dig another
grave for the rest of my life.

12
00:00:44,625 --> 00:00:47,416
I have... decided.

13
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,916
[Ohji] If you reject Luna,
and you deny survival...

14
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,958
then what is it that
drives you to fight?

15
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:55,708
[Dio]
Don't you think you

16
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,250
should be paying more
attention Casshern?!

17
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,583
Casshern...

18
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:08,666
I wonder where Dio
could've taken him.

19
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:18,625
Ringo...! I can't find
her, she's gone!

20

[crowd murmuring]

21
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,416
Do not worry my friends...

22
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,791
...I will heal you.

23
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,666
[Casshern thinks]
Why do I fight?

24
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:15,375
[Casshern thinks] The fight I'm
engaged in now has meaning.

25
00:04:24,583 --> 00:04:26,916
[Casshern thinks] Dio's
reason for being is violence...

26
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,708
...at least right now,
in this moment!

27
00:04:41,166 --> 00:04:44,416
[Casshern thinks]
And I... am no different!

28
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:53,625
[baby crying]

29
00:05:09,166 --> 00:05:14,458
[Leda] Don't cry...
Mommy's right here.

30
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,083
It'll be okay... my baby.

31
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:47,625
[quietly then yells] How dare...
How dare she!

32
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,625
[Screaming]
Luna!!

33
00:05:50,708 --> 00:05:56,250
[Leda has labored
breathing and then screams]

34
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:03,458
[Ringo whimpers]

35
00:06:55,666 --> 00:06:58,625
[Leda emits an audible
gasp as she falls]

36
00:07:13,708 --> 00:07:15,666
[Ringo]
Does it hurt?

37
00:07:17,625 --> 00:07:19,000
Right here?

38
00:07:37,541 --> 00:07:40,500
[Leda shudders]

39
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,125
[Leda]
You're...

40
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:59,458
Wait, aren't you...

41
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,333
Leda.

42
00:08:13,958 --> 00:08:15,333
[Ohji]
Ringo!

43
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,375
Ohji!

44
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:22,875
[Ringo]
I heard someone say

45
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,958
Luna had started
healing again...

46
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:26,791
so I ran away...

47
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,875
But I must've gotten
lost at some point.

48
00:08:29,958 --> 00:08:32,000
[Ringo laughs]

49
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:36,166
Ringo... What exactly were
you doing with that lady?

50
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,583
Well I was hiding
in the scrapyard when...

51
00:08:38,666 --> 00:08:42,291
...some of Luna's robots
threw her away...

52
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,333
That lady... She was.

53
00:08:47,416 --> 00:08:48,833
She was what Ringo...

54
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,583
keep going.

55
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:53,500
I was watching her...

56
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,541
She was crying.

57
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,500
What the hell
is happening here?

58
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,541
[metal clanking
and then metal falling]

59
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,583
Luna!

60
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,666
This is no good...

61
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:26,541
The stench of ruin is
much too strong here.

62
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:36,041
So here we are.

63
00:09:46,125 --> 00:09:47,416
Casshern...

64
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,875
Prepare to meet your end!

65
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,750
[Dio wails as he powers up]

66
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:57,916
[screams and fighting]

67
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,000
I won.

68
00:10:44,583 --> 00:10:49,875
I just beat... Casshern.

69
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,333
Dio.

70
00:11:08,208 --> 00:11:11,500
Luna... I cannot forgive this.

71
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,000
Look at what
you did to me!

72
00:11:21,875 --> 00:11:24,833
Luna...! You must pay!

73
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,416
[Luna]
I went out of my way

74
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:46,375
to grant you eternal life...

75
00:11:46,458 --> 00:11:49,750
and yet you still reek of decay.

76
00:11:49,833 --> 00:11:51,291
Unfortunately...

77
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,291
All I can grant you is death.

78
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:01,625
[Leda] But I haven't
done anything wrong.

79
00:12:01,708 --> 00:12:05,375
All I want...
is to live.

80
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,041
I find death and decay...

81
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,791
to be ugly...

82
00:12:08,875 --> 00:12:12,250
They have no place here.

83
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,583
But what about me...?

84
00:12:14,666 --> 00:12:17,541
I wanted to be given
a chance at a new life.

85
00:12:29,833 --> 00:12:32,458
Luna... Stop it.

86
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:37,625
Casshern?

87
00:12:43,708 --> 00:12:46,333
Thank goodness... He's okay.

88
00:12:46,416 --> 00:12:47,791
Casshern.

89
00:13:01,166 --> 00:13:03,125
That's enough.

90
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:04,666
Why is that...?

91
00:13:04,750 --> 00:13:07,416
Need I remind you that
she tried to kill you?

92
00:13:09,458 --> 00:13:15,916
Dio asked for a favor...
he wanted me to save you.

93
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,750
[Leda]
He did...? Why...?

94
00:13:19,833 --> 00:13:21,791
Did you two fight?

95
00:13:26,666 --> 00:13:29,625
[yelling and fighting]

96
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,291
I won.

97
00:13:43,208 --> 00:13:47,958
I just beat... Casshern.

98
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,250
My fate doesn't matter.

99
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:01,000
[cracking]

100
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:07,166
[Dio] I defeated you...
that's all I ever wanted.

101
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:08,625
Dio.

102
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,500
[shattering]

103
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,083
[Dio]
Please...

104
00:14:22,166 --> 00:14:24,833
Save her for me.

105
00:14:35,083 --> 00:14:38,750
Dio... really said that?

106
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:43,708
Dio...

107
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,500
[heavy clang]

108
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:59,583
It's an ugly sight...

109
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:01,041
Casshern...

110
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:03,625
Now you see the
ugliness of ruin...

111
00:15:03,708 --> 00:15:05,541
How foolish death is...

112
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,583
Wouldn't you agree?

113
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:11,666
Those like you who
are filled with life

114
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:13,458
have but one choice...

115
00:15:13,541 --> 00:15:16,500
...to walk behind me
and my legion.

116
00:15:19,291 --> 00:15:22,250
You know you're worthy
enough to be the King...

117
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,375
You and I...

118
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:27,375
We could make an
eternal kingdom here.

119
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:30,416
[Luna]
Together, as one.

120
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,833
[Luna]
Why not?

121
00:15:38,916 --> 00:15:40,666
It's because...

122
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:43,291
...there's nothing
here but life.

123
00:15:43,375 --> 00:15:45,458
[Luna] And what's
wrong with that...?

124
00:15:45,541 --> 00:15:48,500
You can live forever.

125
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:49,916
Not quite...

126
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,500
Even though
there is life...

127
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:54,416
...no one here is living it.

128
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,208
I'm not sure I follow...

129
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,541
What are you saying?

130
00:16:03,625 --> 00:16:04,875
I'm saying...

131
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,333
that life is overflowing

132
00:16:06,416 --> 00:16:09,458
from you like water
from a natural spring...

133
00:16:09,541 --> 00:16:14,833
And those who flock to you
are merely drinking their fill.

134
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,791
But Dio... and all the
robots and humans I've

135
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,166
met on my journey...

136
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,583
They're not like that...!

137
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,000
They're...

138
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:25,041
[Dio screams]

139
00:16:30,958 --> 00:16:32,833
They're more!

140
00:16:36,666 --> 00:16:39,250
[Casshern]
They were blazing with fire.

141
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:52,625
Dio.

142
00:16:56,875 --> 00:16:58,750
[Casshern]
They were...

143
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:02,666
...torches burning with life.

144
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,708
But every flame
burns out someday.

145
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,875
Exactly... and that's what
made them so beautiful.

146
00:17:19,208 --> 00:17:20,416
But then...

147
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:23,583
There's no way I can
convince you of that...

148
00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:26,625
...since I will live forever.

149
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,791
You see...

150
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:34,500
because I can't die...

151
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:38,125
I can never truly live.

152
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,000
Poor Casshern.

153
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:49,875
I still can't find any

154
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,833
mean in the battles
I've fought or...

155
00:17:51,916 --> 00:17:55,875
Nor can I find one in you.

156
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,875
Is that so...?

157
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,416
I can't find one
in you either...

158
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:04,083
You're just an empty shell.

159
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:05,500
Oh Casshern...

160
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:06,666
I look back fondly on

161
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,333
the day you
came to kill me...

162
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:10,375
You were so beautiful.

163
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,208
[Luna]
That day...

164
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,833
...the death inside
me flowed outward...

165
00:18:21,916 --> 00:18:23,875
...into the world...

166
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:32,041
And I... was released from
the oppressive grip of death...

167
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:34,958
Just like you.

168
00:18:35,041 --> 00:18:37,458
If I had known what
would happen that day,

169
00:18:37,541 --> 00:18:40,208
I probably would have...

170
00:18:40,291 --> 00:18:42,916
Actually... I would've
done it anyway...

171
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,083
knowing who I was then...

172
00:18:45,166 --> 00:18:47,375
If I was liberated
from anything...

173
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,333
it was most likely my heart...

174
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,208
and the regret that it had felt.

175
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:53,541
You act...

176
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:56,583
as if you are a sinner... yes?

177
00:18:56,666 --> 00:18:59,625
Well I... probably am.

178
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:08,916
[Casshern]
Farewell... Luna.

179
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,958
[Casshern] I don't want to take
a life away from anyone...

180
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,833
...ever again.

181
00:19:29,375 --> 00:19:32,333
[Casshern] I never want
to fight again either.

182
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,083
Casshern!!

183
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,583
Ringo.

184
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,833
Do you mind if we... tag along?

185
00:19:47,916 --> 00:19:49,041
But wait...

186
00:19:49,125 --> 00:19:50,916
Aren't you two...?

187
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:55,458
We want to live...

188
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,833
We want to set
our torches aflame...

189
00:19:58,916 --> 00:20:00,500
You know?

190
00:20:00,583 --> 00:20:02,416
[Ringo laughs]

191
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:12,375
Ohji!

192
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:14,500
[Ohji] As long
as you keep smiling,

193
00:20:14,583 --> 00:20:17,291
it's all the proof I
need that I'm alive...

194
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:21,291
We'll be together
forever, Ringo.

195
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:30,166
[Luna]
So be it...

196
00:20:30,250 --> 00:20:32,291
Goodbye, Casshern...

197
00:20:32,375 --> 00:20:35,458
I shall wait here
for a new king.

198
00:20:41,625 --> 00:20:45,375
[Casshern]
Dio asked for a favor...

199
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,166
[Dio]
Please...

200
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,333
Save her for me.

201
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,458
And you are?

202
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,583
My name is Braiking Boss.

203
00:21:37,708 --> 00:21:41,791
And I have come here
today to end the ruin...

204
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:45,416
...with the help of
your healing, of course.

205
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,000
I've been waiting for you...

206
00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:49,208
Braiking Boss...

207
00:21:49,291 --> 00:21:52,125
We shall create
a new kingdom.

208
00:21:53,958 --> 00:22:00,583
Ah yes... Let us build...
a new robotic empire.

209
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:37,708
[Casshern] When the world
begins to twist and warp anew...

210
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:40,875
...he shall return.

211
00:23:40,958 --> 00:23:42,333
Next time...

212
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:45,708
To the Wandering,
Blooming Flowers.
