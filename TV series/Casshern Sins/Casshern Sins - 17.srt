And then our father,

If you tell me
more about yourselves...

to find a way to reunite

have agreed to it.

In hindsight I was a fool.

Just what're
you talking about?

Entrusting the future
to children was a mistake.

00:12:23,583 --> 00:12:25,625
...forgive myself...

165
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:28,416
...for being so dumb...

166
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:31,458
...for even considering
it as a real option.

167
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,083
I am Leda...

168
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,958
I am the most beautiful
woman in the world...

169
00:12:42,041 --> 00:12:44,583
I am also the most noble...

170
00:12:44,666 --> 00:12:47,250
I refuse to permit decay.

171
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,583
[Leda]
I will not allow it!

172
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:52,666
[Leda] I won't let myself
be compromised!

173
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,791
[Hotie]
You're getting... scary.

174
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:57,125
You're not like Luna.

175
00:12:58,208 --> 00:13:00,000
[Children gasp]

176
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:04,416
Now tell me all about
Luna and your father.

177
00:13:05,625 --> 00:13:10,333
I want to know...
every one of their secrets.

178
00:13:10,416 --> 00:13:12,000
Excuse me...

179
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:15,166
I need to step
out for a moment.

180
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,833
Now then.

181
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:23,125
Where exactly did
they leave their secrets?

182
00:13:23,208 --> 00:13:24,375
We don't know.

183
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,375
We're telling the truth.
We don't know anything.

184
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,916
Then you better
start looking for it...

185
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,083
Don't make me ask again.

186
00:13:33,333 --> 00:13:36,083
Your skin's so
incredibly soft...

187
00:13:36,166 --> 00:13:39,541
It almost makes me...
want to puke.

188
00:13:39,625 --> 00:13:40,583
Stop it...!

189
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:42,833
Come on let him go!

[Leda]
Let him go!

192
00:13:52,416 --> 00:13:55,041
Now... are you gonna help me?

193
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:03,166
[Ohji chuckles]

194
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,958
What's the matter, Friender? 

195
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:12,000
[Friender whines]

196
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000

Casshern!

198

[Leda]
Alright kids, think hard.

199
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:25,458
[Leda] What were your father
and Luna doing in here?

200
00:14:25,541 --> 00:14:28,166
What was it they left behind?

201
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:30,333
We don't know... Really.

202
00:14:30,416 --> 00:14:32,375
Don't lie to me!

203
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:37,541
Hold on...!

204
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:39,875
I just remembered something.

205
00:14:40,708 --> 00:14:42,958
Our father said that
eternity doesn't exist

206
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:44,833
for people who
have never loved...

207
00:14:44,916 --> 00:14:47,458
So he told us as long
as we felt love for someone...

208
00:14:47,541 --> 00:14:50,875
...then we could live forever
in peace and happiness.

209
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,875
[Leda]
Love?

210
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,333
That's what he said.

211
00:14:54,416 --> 00:14:56,041
So just love someone...
and then you'll...!

212
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:57,916
I already do...!

213
00:14:59,250 --> 00:15:02,583
The love that I feel for
myself trumps all others.

214
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:09,291
Now... You better start telling
me what I want to hear...

215
00:15:09,375 --> 00:15:12,250
Otherwise your
sibling's gonna suffer!

216

Please don't.

My, you look as beautiful
as ever... Casshern.

221
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:53,791
But... I will be the one
to gain eternal beauty...

222
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:56,416
...because I am the woman...!

in that stupid dream!

we would like to give you.

No... Why?

went to sleep, that's all.

Holter?

263

I'm going to give you
the secret my siblings

and I have been
guarding for many years...

265
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:48,208
It is a treasure which our
father had left behind for us.

Holter... Are you a...

267

waiting here for such

a long, long time...

to remain in a child's form...

Needless to say we were
happy and relieved to meet you.

for far too long...

...and now I can
finally go to sleep...

use it to stop the ruin?

worth studying ...

as fast as you can.

Don't cry... We won't be
apart for very long.

You understand, right?

294
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:45,875
Yeah... The next time
you see me I won't be

295
00:21:45,958 --> 00:21:47,416
a little girl anymore.

296
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:48,833
I'll be grown up.

You sure will.

out there somewhere...?

does feel like she is.

[Casshern] When the chosen
mission only hinders oneself...

the emotions of truth.
