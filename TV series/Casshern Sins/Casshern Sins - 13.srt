1
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:15,000
[Ringo] It's not your
fault Casshern...!

2
00:00:15,083 --> 00:00:19,750
It's not your fault...! 
It's not...

3
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,375
Casshern.

4
00:02:05,958 --> 00:02:09,958
[Robot refugee A] My hands...
they're falling apart.

5
00:02:10,041 --> 00:02:12,083
[Robot refugee A]
I just need to be patient...

6
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,583
...because Luna will
stop the ruin...

7
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:17,583
I just need to believe,
and it will end.

8
00:02:19,083 --> 00:02:21,125
[Robot refugee A]
Look... Look...!

9
00:02:21,208 --> 00:02:25,791
The ruin, it stopped...
It's over!

10
00:02:25,875 --> 00:02:29,750
[Robot refugee A] There's not a
single speck of rust on me!

11
00:02:29,833 --> 00:02:32,333
[Robot refugee A] Anyone
who isn't ready to die...

12
00:02:32,416 --> 00:02:34,250
...go to Luna!

13
00:02:35,208 --> 00:02:38,583
[robot refugees
murmur to each other]

14
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:41,791
[Robot refugee A] Go to Luna
and accept her healing!

15
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:46,333
So Luna is alive...?

16
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,208
How can that be?

17
00:02:56,250 --> 00:02:57,625
The healing...

18
00:02:57,708 --> 00:02:58,541
What kind of relief

19
00:02:58,625 --> 00:03:00,708
could there be
in this world?

20
00:03:04,291 --> 00:03:06,250
[baby girl emits a small cry]

21
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,375
[Lyuze] Are you still
looking for Luna?

22
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:15,625
[Casshern]
Yes.

23
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,250
You're wasting your time.

24
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:19,458
It's just a rumor...

25
00:03:19,541 --> 00:03:21,375
Your actions lead to
the death of Luna,

26
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:25,458
which caused the suffering
you're witnessing right now.

27
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:27,708
[Lyuze] I'm willing to bet that
you believe your sins will

28
00:03:27,791 --> 00:03:31,291
be forgotten if
you find her alive.

29
00:03:31,375 --> 00:03:32,791
That won't happen...

30
00:03:32,875 --> 00:03:35,500
...because she's dead.

31
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:39,166
Tell me... Wouldn't you rather
have Luna be found alive?

32
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:41,208
[Lyuze gasps]

33
00:03:44,375 --> 00:03:46,750
[Lyuze] There's
no simple answer.

34
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:51,000
But if she is...

35
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:54,791
...then what did my
sister die for...?

36
00:03:54,875 --> 00:03:58,791
Then... why've I been
seeking revenge...?

37
00:03:58,875 --> 00:04:00,666
For nothing?

38
00:04:13,375 --> 00:04:15,375
I'm going to see Luna now.

39
00:04:19,083 --> 00:04:21,875
We'll see what
happens... afterwards.

40
00:04:39,833 --> 00:04:41,416
[metal slamming into the ground]

41
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,083
[Robot warrior A]
Death to all deserters!

42
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,500
[Robot warrior B]This is
what you get for spouting

43
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,500
such nonsense that Luna
will stop the ruin...

44
00:04:46,583 --> 00:04:48,083
It's a lie!

45
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:51,041
[Robot warrior C] Lord Dio is
the only one worth believing in!

46
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:55,250
[Leda]
Luna is alive.

47
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,708
[Dio] Eventually...
We shall grant healing

48
00:05:00,791 --> 00:05:02,541
to robots and humans...

49
00:05:02,625 --> 00:05:05,583
Just as Luna had done before.

50
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,625
True...
but when Luna did that...

51
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:11,583
...there was no ruin
to contend with.

52
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:14,666
[Dio] Back then... I never once
stopped to consider why

53
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:19,083
Braiking Boss wanted Luna
assassinated so desperately.

54
00:05:22,958 --> 00:05:24,208
Yes but...

55
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:27,541
...it's important that
you understand something.

56
00:05:27,625 --> 00:05:30,875
[Leda] There can
only be... one victor.

57
00:05:42,125 --> 00:05:44,083
Luna, huh?

58
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:02,250
Ohji... who is Luna...?

59
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:05,458
It's all everyone's
talking about out there.

60
00:06:05,541 --> 00:06:07,500
If they're talking about
her it's probably just a

61
00:06:07,583 --> 00:06:10,166
crazy person claiming
to be someone else...

62
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:12,416
...or just a phantom.

63
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:15,583
[Ohji] There's no chance they're
talking about the real Luna.

64
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:20,125
[Ohji thinks] Casshern
killed Luna...

65
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,000
Damn him.

66
00:06:26,708 --> 00:06:29,083
[Ringo]
Ohji.

67
00:06:29,166 --> 00:06:31,375
Smile for me...

68
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:33,250
Like this!

69
00:06:34,916 --> 00:06:36,875
[Ohji emits a laughing grunt]
[Ringo chuckles]

70
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,250
[Ohji sighs]

71
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,916
[Ohji] You must be
getting sleepy, Ringo...

72
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,958
What do you say we
take a break here soon?

73
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,666
[Lyuze]
Say you do find Luna,

74
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:57,458
and every question
you have is answered.

75
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,166
[Lyuze]You'll quickly
discover it's no different from

76
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:01,166
what I've told you myself...

77
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,500
Doesn't that frighten you?

78
00:07:03,583 --> 00:07:06,083
[Casshern] The old me
probably would have been...

79
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,041
...but not now.

80
00:07:08,125 --> 00:07:10,625
[Casshern] I've seen the
ruin with my own eyes...

81
00:07:10,708 --> 00:07:12,958
...and I am
determined to stop it.

82
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:19,458
[rolls of thunder]

83
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:30,750
[Casshern] Careful...
The ground is loose over there.

84
00:07:30,833 --> 00:07:32,625
[ground crumbles]

85
00:07:44,375 --> 00:07:46,750
[Casshern] I've seen the
ruin with my own eyes...

86
00:07:46,833 --> 00:07:49,791
...and I am
determined to stop it.

87
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:51,291
And to do that...

88
00:07:51,375 --> 00:07:54,333
I need to find out
exactly what happened.

89
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:02,000
But even if Luna
does turn out to be alive...

90
00:08:02,083 --> 00:08:04,041
...it doesn't change the
fact that the ruin is

91
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,208
still your fault...

92
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,708
That will never change.

93
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,750
[Ohji] What luck... Getting
a flat in the middle of nowhere

94
00:08:14,833 --> 00:08:16,500
while it's raining.

95
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,583
Ohji... are you alright?

96
00:08:20,666 --> 00:08:22,625
[Ohji] I'll be
done soon.

97
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:27,875
[Ringo laughs]

98
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,708
[Ringo]
Yay, rain!

99
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,916
[Ringo continues to laugh]

100
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,625
Ringo...! You're getting wet...!

101
00:08:34,708 --> 00:08:36,083
Get back inside the truck!

102
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,875
It's okay, I'll be fine...!

103
00:08:37,958 --> 00:08:39,791
I love the rain, Ohji...!

104
00:08:39,875 --> 00:08:41,000
Whenever it rains it

105
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:43,416
looks like the whole
world is sparkling...!

106
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,041
More than anything
I love the sound it makes.

107
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,125
[rain drops land in puddles
of water and metal]

108
00:08:54,916 --> 00:08:56,708
[raindrop hits object]

109
00:08:57,625 --> 00:09:00,291
[raindrops hit bottle
causing musical tones]

110
00:09:00,375 --> 00:09:02,166
[Ringo]
What's that?

111
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:09,625
It's so pretty.

112
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:11,625
[Ringo laughs]

113
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:15,750
[Ringo] I know!

114
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:19,083
[Ringo]
I can see so far away!

115
00:09:19,166 --> 00:09:22,125
[Ringo] Look at me
I have super eyes!

116
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:24,666
It's Casshern...!

117
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,458
I can see Casshern!

118
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,166
[Ohji] Ringo!
Let's get going!

119
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,541
[Ringo] Ohji...!
Casshern's over here!

120
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,125
Casshern is where?

121
00:09:34,208 --> 00:09:35,625
Down that cliff...!

122
00:09:35,708 --> 00:09:37,083
Casshern!

123
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,458
Ringo, wait!

124
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:42,500
[Ringo] Come up
and look, Ohji!

125
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:45,541
Oh dammit...

126
00:09:49,666 --> 00:09:53,125
Don't think I like the
looks of those storm clouds.

127
00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:56,333
[Ringo]
Casshern!

128
00:09:57,666 --> 00:09:59,208
Cassh--

129
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,625
Ringo...?

130
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,083
Why are you here?

131
00:10:02,166 --> 00:10:03,333
[Ringo chuckles]

132
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,208
I just tripped.

133
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,000
[Casshern] Ringo,
are you alright?

134
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,500
Yeah, I'm fine...

135
00:10:08,583 --> 00:10:09,958
[Ringo]
Check it out!

136
00:10:10,041 --> 00:10:12,041
Don't you think
it's the prettiest...?

137
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,083
I found it all by myself!

138
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:17,083
[Lyuze] Ringo,
what's going on...?

139
00:10:17,166 --> 00:10:18,708
Look at you,
you're soaking wet.

140
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:19,750
[Ringo]
I'm okay.

141
00:10:19,833 --> 00:10:21,500
No, you're not okay...

142
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:22,750
You aren't even
wearing a coat,

143
00:10:22,833 --> 00:10:25,750
what'll you do if
you start rusting?

144
00:10:25,833 --> 00:10:27,083
What to do?

145
00:10:27,166 --> 00:10:30,583
[Lyuze] We need to get her
somewhere dry, and fast.

146
00:10:51,875 --> 00:10:55,708
Maybe... you should get
closer to the fire.

147
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,583
[Ringo giggles]

148
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:01,625
Come on...

149
00:11:01,708 --> 00:11:03,250
Stay still for me.

150
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,708
'Kay!

151
00:11:05,291 --> 00:11:07,250
[Ringo continues to laugh]

152
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,625
Ringo...

153
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:23,583
Her ruin is spreading.

154
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,625
Alright... put your arms up.

155
00:11:25,708 --> 00:11:27,083
'Kay!

156
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:30,000
Ringo?

157
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,833
Are you... bleeding?

158
00:11:32,916 --> 00:11:34,916
Uh... looks like it...

159
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:38,458
...but it doesn't
hurt though... I'm fine!

160
00:11:38,541 --> 00:11:41,208
[Lyuze] But...
you're starting to rust.

161
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,833
You're dry now...
put your clothes back on...

162
00:11:46,916 --> 00:11:48,833
Don't want you gettin' cold.

163
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:50,291
[Ringo]
Okay!

164
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:56,416
[Ringo] You go on first,
mister shirt...

165
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:58,458
[Ringo emits an anxious sound]

[thunder cracks]

169
00:12:39,416 --> 00:12:41,208
I don't mean to intrude...

170
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:43,041
Hope you don't mind
if I escape from the

171
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:45,416
rain for a while.

172
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,500
[Braiking Boss] My
decaying body and water

173
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,541
don't get along too well.

174
00:12:54,458 --> 00:12:57,416
[thunder cracks]

175
00:13:11,625 --> 00:13:14,541
Ooh, feels nice and cold!

176
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:17,291
[Ringo]
Hey Lyuze!

177
00:13:17,375 --> 00:13:20,000
Come look... over here!

178
00:13:24,708 --> 00:13:27,291
[fire crackles]

179
00:13:33,083 --> 00:13:36,083
Why are you looking
at him like that?

180
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,875
You haven't taken your eyes
off Casshern since you got here.

181
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:44,750
Is that right?

182
00:13:47,666 --> 00:13:50,250
Are you searching
for Luna as well?

183
00:13:50,666 --> 00:13:52,833
[Braiking Boss grunts]

184
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:55,166
[Lyuze] It may not really
be her, you know.

185
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:57,250
[Braiking Boss]
Why's that?

186
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,708
Because.

187
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:02,375
Because...?

188
00:14:03,583 --> 00:14:05,833
Because Casshern killed her?

189
00:14:07,333 --> 00:14:10,541
What...? How do you know that?

190
00:14:13,708 --> 00:14:16,625
[Ringo] The only way to make
these shells look prettier...

191
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:19,500
is to put them... in the water.

192
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:25,125
[Ringo] It worked!
They're sparkling!

193
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,125
The only way to find
out if this Luna is

194
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:31,000
real or not... would be by
meeting her face to face.

195
00:14:31,083 --> 00:14:33,500
[Braiking Boss] Same goes
for her healing powers.

196
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,458
[Lyuze]
Casshern.

197
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:42,500
No... it couldn't be?

198
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:44,375
[Braiking Boss lightly chuckles]

199
00:14:45,125 --> 00:14:46,916
[Casshern]
No... your...

200
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,125
[Ringo emits a cry
after stumbling]

201
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:57,791
[bottle breaks]

202
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:02,041
[Casshern]
No... it's...!

203
00:15:03,375 --> 00:15:05,166
[Casshern]
Braiking Boss!

204
00:15:07,958 --> 00:15:10,916
[Casshern groans and
begins to struggle]

205
00:15:12,666 --> 00:15:14,250
[Lyuze]
Casshern?

206
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:18,666
[Casshern]
Luna... Luna...!

207
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:28,416
[Braiking Boss] Seems like
your memory is coming back.

208
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,291
You were bound to
find out sooner or later...

209
00:15:32,375 --> 00:15:34,166
Now you can take
responsibility for what

210
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,708
you've done to this planet...

211
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,958
Isn't that right, Professor?

212
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,000
What are you saying?

213
00:15:43,125 --> 00:15:45,500
Professor...?
Then you're...

214
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:53,666
That's correct...

215
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,208
Standing right behind me...

216
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,250
Casshern... is your creator.

217
00:15:59,375 --> 00:16:01,166
Oh well...

218
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,666
Way back...

219
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:22,708
A long time ago a
robot tried to become God...

220
00:16:22,791 --> 00:16:26,500
No wait... He did something
even dumber than that...

221
00:16:26,583 --> 00:16:29,583
He tried to create God.

222
00:16:29,666 --> 00:16:31,958
[Braiking Boss] It was an
attempt to gain eternal life,

223
00:16:32,041 --> 00:16:35,666
all though we'd already
conquered that ages before.

224
00:16:35,750 --> 00:16:38,041
[Braiking Boss] Even humans had
attained it thanks to advances

225
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:40,875
in modern medicine,
leaving only the unluckiest

226
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:42,916
of humans to perish.

227
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:45,166
But there was one advantage

228
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,916
humanity held over
the heads of robots.

229
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:54,791
[Braiking Boss]
The ability to procreate.

230
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:03,291
If we could reproduce,

231
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:07,625
it would be our final step
towards surpassing mankind...

232
00:17:07,708 --> 00:17:10,250
We could become Gods.

233
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:11,875
You're crazy...

234
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,875
It's impossible.

235
00:17:13,958 --> 00:17:18,041
But procreation
is possible in theory.

236
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,166
The systems installed
in their bodies were

237
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:23,708
fundamentally different
from your standard robot.

238
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,583
[Ohji] You have males,
who can create new

239
00:17:25,666 --> 00:17:27,625
cells within their bodies...

240
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,541
And females, who are
capable of accepting those cells

241
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,333
to fertilize their own...
creating a new,

242
00:17:33,416 --> 00:17:35,750
complete life form.

243
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:39,875
[Ohji] I'm referring, of course,
to Casshern, Dio and Leda.

244
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:44,666
So does that explain
why Casshern is immortal?

245
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:48,791
[Ohji] No... I had
nothing to do with that.

246
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:49,750
[Ohji]
And in the end,

247
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:52,500
all three were
deemed failures.

248
00:17:54,958 --> 00:17:56,541
[Ohji]
After much debate...

249
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,000
...their only use was found

250
00:17:58,083 --> 00:18:00,916
in exploiting their
abnormally powerful bodies...

251
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,375
they became killing machines.

252
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,875
Killing... machines.

253
00:18:06,958 --> 00:18:09,916
[screams of victims]

254
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:12,916
[Casshern]
Is that all I am...?

255
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,291
A monster of death?

256
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:18,166
[Ohji] I have no idea how
you became immortal...

257
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:21,375
It must have happened sometime
after you killed Luna.

258
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:22,708
[Braiking Boss]
You're right...

259
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,250
It was Luna...

260
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:26,916
perhaps it all began
after her first death...

261
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,250
and her subsequent
reappearance...

262
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:35,083
Luna.

263
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:37,791
She was the Sun
that was named Moon...

264
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:40,000
That was her identity.

265
00:18:42,458 --> 00:18:44,125
[Braiking Boss] Eventually
the masses began

266
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,083
to tire of eternal life...

267
00:18:46,166 --> 00:18:48,875
but she came along
and reinvigorated that desire,

268
00:18:48,958 --> 00:18:51,083
giving us the strength to live.

269
00:18:51,166 --> 00:18:53,041
That's what Luna was about.

270
00:18:53,125 --> 00:18:54,625
[Braiking Boss]
However, the fact remains

271
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:57,958
that only one is capable
of ruling the world.

272
00:18:58,041 --> 00:19:01,000
[Braiking Boss] There's
no need for two suns...

273
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:04,041
That is why I gave the order...

274
00:19:09,125 --> 00:19:11,666
[Braiking Boss]
For you to kill Luna.

275
