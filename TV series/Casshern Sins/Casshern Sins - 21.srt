00:00:13,208 --> 00:00:15,166
[Luna gasps]

3
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,750
Do you smell it...?

4
00:00:29,833 --> 00:00:32,458
These flowers reek of death.

5
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:35,166
[Casshern] Luna. The idea
that you have the power of

6
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,041
healing is a lie...

7
00:00:37,125 --> 00:00:38,875
You haven't saved anyone...

8
00:00:38,958 --> 00:00:41,208
...not even your own guardian.

9
00:00:50,625 --> 00:00:52,708
Where are you going...?

10
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:57,250
I thought you came here
seeking salvation from me.

11
00:00:57,333 --> 00:00:59,708
[Ringo near tears]

12
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:03,375
There's no need
for sorrow anymore...

13
00:01:03,458 --> 00:01:07,875
Contrary to what you believe,
I can save you from the ruin.

14
00:01:07,958 --> 00:01:10,666
How do we know that it's true?

15
00:01:12,875 --> 00:01:15,000
[Casshern] These
thousands of people...

16
00:01:15,083 --> 00:01:17,041
Can you really heal them?

17
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:26,000
[Luna] A single drop of
blood from my veins...

18
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:30,750
revives the soul completely...
and grants eternal life.

19
00:01:30,833 --> 00:01:35,000
I have answered the calls
of those who have come here...

20
00:01:35,083 --> 00:01:38,041
...and I have granted
all their wishes.

21
00:01:40,958 --> 00:01:43,375
A single drop of
blood from my veins...

22
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:45,541
revives the soul
completely... 

23
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:49,208
...and grants eternal life.

24
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:52,375
[Luna] I have answered the calls
of those who have come here...

25
00:01:52,458 --> 00:01:54,875
And I have granted
every one of their wishes.

26
00:01:54,958 --> 00:01:57,541
But then... what about Dune?

27
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:03,375
Why would you...
allow him to die?

28
00:02:03,458 --> 00:02:07,375
[Luna] Dune refused my blood,
and as a consequence...

29
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:10,291
...he went the way of ruin...

30
00:02:10,375 --> 00:02:15,666
Ideally... Death is a concept
that should not exist.

31
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:17,291
[Casshern]
Not exist...?

32
00:02:17,375 --> 00:02:19,541
What do you mean?

33
00:02:19,625 --> 00:02:24,500
Death is terror... darkness...
The fact remains...

34
00:02:24,583 --> 00:02:27,875
If people could escape
the pits of death and ruin...

35
00:02:27,958 --> 00:02:30,291
...they would all
be much happier...

36
00:02:30,375 --> 00:02:31,958
Only then could they...

37
00:02:32,041 --> 00:02:35,541
...thoroughly enjoy
the bounties of life.

38
00:02:35,625 --> 00:02:38,500
You're wrong.

39
00:02:38,583 --> 00:02:40,291
[Casshern]
If that's true...

40
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:42,833
...then explain to me this...

41
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:46,000
Why do I suffer so much?

42
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,416
Hold on, wait a second...

43
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
Are you saying everything
I'm doing for these

44
00:02:51,583 --> 00:02:53,208
people is wrong?

45
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:56,958
[Luna] Stopping the
ruin is a bad thing?

46
00:02:57,041 --> 00:02:58,333
Truth is...

47
00:02:58,416 --> 00:03:00,791
I want you to stay.

48
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:02,458
What for?

49
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:05,625
So he can take Dune's place...

50
00:03:05,708 --> 00:03:08,791
...and protect this
field of flowers.

51
00:03:15,208 --> 00:03:17,166
[Lyuze]
Let's go Ringo.

52
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,541
Wait!

53
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:34,708
[gust of wind]

54
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,416
[Dio] My body
is decaying, Leda...

55
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,541
And yet, as my skin rusts
and movements dull,

56
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,750
my senses are more
acute than ever before.

57
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:44,291
[Dio] They're
sharp, and exacting.

58
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,791
As I continue...

59
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:49,291
...to hunt down Casshern
in the void of darkness...

60
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,958
Endlessly.

61
00:05:52,458 --> 00:05:54,541
Lets be going...

62
00:05:54,625 --> 00:05:56,583
Luna awaits us.

63
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:03,125
Just you wait, Luna...

64
00:06:03,208 --> 00:06:06,083
I'm going to make you mine.

65
00:06:16,875 --> 00:06:18,833
Are you coming...?

66
00:06:20,083 --> 00:06:22,791
It's time to go...

67
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,541
We already dug a
grave for Dune...

68
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:28,541
There's no reason
for us to stay here.

69
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,583
But Lyuze...?

70
00:06:31,416 --> 00:06:33,416
No... It's okay.

71
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:37,458
I don't want any
part of her... salvation.

72
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:49,666
[Ringo groans]

73
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:54,416
[Lyuze] Oh no!

74
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,000
[Casshern] Ringo!

75
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:59,208
I'm alright... Let's go...

76
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:01,083
I don't...

77
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,041
I wanna leave.

78
00:07:36,041 --> 00:07:38,458
Is this yours?

79
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,916
[robot boy A]
Mmm.

[crowd groans]

90
00:08:35,916 --> 00:08:40,666
Luna's clinic is just up ahead,
that is if you're interested.

91
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,125
You'd better hurry and
get your place in line...

92
00:08:43,208 --> 00:08:46,125
...before that
thing turns to rust...

93
00:08:46,208 --> 00:08:48,333
Come on back after
you receive her...

94
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,666
grand healing...

95
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:52,458
Well...? Go on.

96
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:54,750
Yeah we'll do that.

00:09:04,125 --> 00:09:05,125

[Ringo groans]

100
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:28,708
What was that...?

101
00:09:28,791 --> 00:09:30,541
Those people were so strange...

102
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:33,416
...they all hated us
for no reason!

103
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:36,416
There's a shadow of
death following us...

104
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:39,833
That's why they
don't like us.

105
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:40,875
Does it have anything

106
00:09:40,958 --> 00:09:43,166
to do with them
escaping the ruin?

107
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:46,750
It does...
That town there...

108
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,000
it's for those who've been

109
00:09:48,083 --> 00:09:51,041
touched by Luna and
will live forever.

110
00:09:56,583 --> 00:09:58,458
[Lyuze]
You know, it's funny...

111
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,500
...for so long I hoped I could
someday escape the ruin...

112
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:09,000
And yet I...
despise that town.

113
00:10:15,916 --> 00:10:19,208
[Casshern] In the morning we
should go see Luna again.

114
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:21,250
[Lyuze expresses shock]

115
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,333
It is the reason why
we came all this way.

116
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,208
[Lyuze]
But...

117
00:10:31,333 --> 00:10:34,583
Is...what Luna
said really true...?

118
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:36,083
Is bowing down before her

119
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:40,333
and begging for salvation
our only option?

120
00:10:40,416 --> 00:10:42,083
Do you have the resolve...

121
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:46,291
...to accept your fate
just like Dune did before?

122
00:10:46,375 --> 00:10:47,750
[metal pings]

123
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:02,541
I see what you mean.

124
00:11:09,333 --> 00:11:17,125
[Lyuze] I'm sorry... I just...
don't know what to do.

125
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:19,250
[Lyuze] You can feel it,
can't you...?

126
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:22,041
The rust is starting to
spread on my skin...

127
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:25,583
It's rough to the touch...

128
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,458
My lips too.

129
00:11:32,375 --> 00:11:34,166
I wish I could...

130
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:35,958
...be smooth like you

131
00:11:36,041 --> 00:11:41,500
and not have to worry
about rusting... But...

132
00:11:41,583 --> 00:11:43,541
[shattering]

133
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:47,791
[Lyuze] If I went back to
that town to be healed...

134
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:52,583
I feel like... like it would
change who I am inside.

135
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:55,500
And I don't want that...

136
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,833
I want to stay who I am.

137
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:05,500
Lyuze... It's okay....

138
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:14,750
[Ringo] You know I can
walk by myself, Casshern.

139
00:12:14,833 --> 00:12:17,041
Hey, are you listening...?

140
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:19,875
Come on, put me down!

141
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,708
Woah careful!

142
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:28,375
Now be a good girl.

143
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,416
[Friender whines]

144
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,708

Ohji?!

00:12:36,208 --> 00:12:37,708
Thank goodness I found you!

00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,916
Ohji you're here!

148
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,375
[Ringo]
Ohji!

149
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:43,875
Are you alright...?

150
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,708
Please tell me you
haven't seen Luna yet.

151
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:48,750
Sure I did. I met her.

152
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:50,000
[Ohji] Huh?

153
00:12:50,083 --> 00:12:52,833
But I... only met
her, that's all...

154
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,875
She didn't heal me.

155
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:02,000
It's not salvation after all.

156
00:13:03,208 --> 00:13:06,166
What Luna really
grants people...

157
00:13:07,375 --> 00:13:09,166
...is death.

158
00:13:12,083 --> 00:13:13,875
[robot refugee A]
Luna...!

159
00:13:13,958 --> 00:13:16,750
Luna, please. I beg of you.

160
00:13:16,833 --> 00:13:19,250
Grant me salvation...!

161
00:13:19,333 --> 00:13:22,166
It is my... only hope.

162
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:24,208
[robot refugee A]
Save me!

163

[Ohji]
Many years ago,

164
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:34,875
the world was filled
with eternal life forms...

165
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,375
Humans found the secret

166
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:38,791
to living forever and
quickly adopted it,

167
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,750
straying far away from death...

168
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,291
Braiking Boss found the
idea to be wrong,

169
00:13:44,375 --> 00:13:49,541
so he used his great power
to exterminate the human race.

170
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,000
[Ohji]
A sliver of humanity

171
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:54,166
survived his holocaust
under the protection of Luna...

172
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:57,041
...albeit just barely...

173
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,833
Soon after robots began
to flock towards Luna,

174
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:03,958
worshipping her much
as the humans did...

175
00:14:04,041 --> 00:14:05,208
Seeing this as a hindrance

176
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,583
to his plans of
world domination...

177
00:14:07,666 --> 00:14:11,166
Braiking Boss ordered
her assassination...

178
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,416
Unbeknownst to him,

179
00:14:12,500 --> 00:14:16,375
Luna did not offer
her followers salvation...

180
00:14:16,458 --> 00:14:19,416
...but instead
the gift of death.

181
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,208
Death?

182
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:33,791
In a world overflowing
with immortal lifeforms...

183
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:38,416
...she gave a natural
lifespan back to all beings.

184
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,291
Lifespan?

185
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:42,458
She believes that true life...

186
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:45,500
...can only be experienced
when there is death.

187
00:14:45,583 --> 00:14:46,708
Hold on...

188
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,875
From what we've seen
over the last few days,

189
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,083
Luna is stopping the ruin.

190
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:54,583
[robot refugee A utters a
shaky emotional sound]

191
00:14:54,666 --> 00:14:57,458
[robot refugee A]
Thank you, Luna, thank you...

192
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,083
You've saved me!

193
00:14:59,166 --> 00:15:01,041
[Ohji sighs]

194
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,375
Well maybe... but...
According to the research

195
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:07,333
I've done lately...
the Luna of old...

196
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:10,166
You're saying the new Luna
and the one from the past

197
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,250
have different motives?

198
00:15:13,416 --> 00:15:15,291
Do you know why?

199
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:18,791
Well perhaps in the

200
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:21,458
interim between her
first death and resurgence...

201
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,583
...something changed.

202
00:15:27,958 --> 00:15:30,250
Well... Here I was rushing

203
00:15:30,333 --> 00:15:33,541
to stop Ringo from being
saved by Luna when...

204
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:37,041
[low rumble]

205
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:40,083
[crowd laughing and talking]

206
00:15:51,083 --> 00:15:55,166
[Ohji thinks] So this is the
product of Luna's healing?

207
00:16:11,458 --> 00:16:14,250
Here we come... Miss Luna.

208
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,541
[marching sounds in distance]

209
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,458
[Ohji] So if we
meet with Luna...

210
00:16:32,541 --> 00:16:35,583
...the ruin will
really stop...?

211
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,291
Ringo...

212
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:40,000
[Ringo whimpers]

213
00:16:40,083 --> 00:16:41,666
Let's go.

214
00:16:44,541 --> 00:16:46,875
[Ringo]
Ohji.

215
00:16:46,958 --> 00:16:48,166
[Ohji]
Come on, Ringo...

216
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:50,541
Let's go see her so
we can have her fix you...

217
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,750
I don't want you to suffer.

218
00:16:53,833 --> 00:16:56,791
No way...! I can't.

219
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,625
Why not?

220
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,666
Luna does stop the ruin but...

221
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,833
It's wrong...

222
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:09,333
Like the sun never setting.

223
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,291
[Casshern]
It's unnatural...

224
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:13,541
A distortion of reality.

225
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,458
[Casshern] I think Ringo
is sensitive to that...

226
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,500
...and she doesn't like it.

227
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,833
[Ohji]
You may be right...

228
00:17:24,916 --> 00:17:27,083
A world without
ruin would be...

229
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:29,750
...strange and abnormal.

230
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,916
But still...

231
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,375
...it's an alternative to dying.

232
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,875
[Ohji] Those who have accepted
Luna's healing have survived...

233
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:43,958
...and yes, their lives
may never be the same.

234
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:46,833
[Ohji] But I do not want
Ringo to suffer and die...

235
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:49,000
Is that so wrong?

236
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:52,833
[Ringo whimpers]

237
00:17:52,916 --> 00:17:55,875
Now... Ringo... Come on.

238
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:02,333
[Ringo grunts disapproval]

239
00:18:02,416 --> 00:18:04,708
Ohji... That's enough.

240
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:08,375
[Ohji] Lyuze...
You're coming with us...

241
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:10,708
Or would you rather die?

242
00:18:17,458 --> 00:18:19,416
[Ringo struggles]

243
00:18:20,291 --> 00:18:22,083
No, Ohji, I don't want to!

244
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:23,750
Please, let go of my hand!

245
00:18:23,833 --> 00:18:26,458
Ohji... Stop it.

246
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,333
Casshern...

247
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:41,833
Are you going to fight me?

248
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:03,166
[robot bandits yell]

249
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,375
Casshern.

250
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,291
He's in the way.

251
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,750
[Ohji] So Casshern,
are you going to fight...?

252
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:23,916
If you don't believe in
the concept of survival...

253
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:27,541
...then what's the
point in fighting...?

254
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,250
It's easy for you to speak
nobly when you're immortal.

255
00:19:31,333 --> 00:19:34,291
[robot bandits yell]

256
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,958
[robot bandit wails]

257
00:19:47,041 --> 00:19:50,125
[Ohji] You don't know
what pain feels like...

258
00:19:50,208 --> 00:19:54,291
What the fear of death
can do to one's mind.

259
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:00,458
[Ohji]
Don't you see, Casshern...?

260
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:04,125
You're the only one with
the luxury of immortality!

261
00:20:04,208 --> 00:20:06,000
Casshern wait!

262
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,041
What the hell are you doing?

263
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,500
Casshern.

264
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,541
[fighting and
robot bandits yelling]

265
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,750
[Casshern cries out]

266
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:52,583
[Dio thinks] Look at him.
He's breaking.

267
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,083
[Casshern thinks]
The feeling of pain...

268
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:03,125
The fear of death.

269
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,916
No!!

270
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:29,000
[Dio] Casshern,
so beautiful and immortal...

271
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:31,541
Your life is perfect...

272
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:33,583
Why throw it away?

273
00:21:39,958 --> 00:21:41,541
[Ringo]
Casshern.

274
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,000
[impact]

275
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,125
[impact]

276
00:21:47,208 --> 00:21:52,500
[Casshern thinks] The sun's so
bright... unnaturally bright.

277
00:21:52,583 --> 00:21:53,541
[impact]

278
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:56,000
[impact]

279
00:21:57,541 --> 00:22:00,208
[Lyuze screams]
Casshern!!

280
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:36,666
[Casshern] Those who
seek it, fear death...

281
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,708
Those who do not,
experience life.

282
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:42,208
Next time...

283
00:23:42,291 --> 00:23:45,500
A Drop Called Eternity.
