1
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:12,000
[Luna] Casshern...
your blood has changed me.

2
00:01:51,416 --> 00:01:53,208
[metal clanks]

3
00:02:15,041 --> 00:02:16,208
[robot bandit A] Up there.

4
00:02:16,291 --> 00:02:17,916
Is that the place where
Dio is supposed to be?

5
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,083
[robot bandit B] Yeah.
Apparently potential recruits

6
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:23,125
into his army are
trickling in bit by bit.

7
00:02:24,791 --> 00:02:26,125
[robot bandit A] You think
that guy is wanting to

8
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,791
join up with Dio too?

9
00:02:27,875 --> 00:02:29,833
[robot bandit C]
Him? No way.

10
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,166
Dio?

11
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:37,000
[robot bandit C]
Is this guy for real?

12
00:02:37,083 --> 00:02:38,875
[robot bandit B]
What a joke.

13
00:02:39,791 --> 00:02:42,833
[robot bandit A] Look at him...
Dio would eat this one alive.

14
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,666
[robot bandit B]
I refuse to be associated

15
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:47,541
with this rusted
pile of circuits.

16
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:48,791
[robot bandit C]
I could take you out

17
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,833
right now if I wanted to.

18
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:04,708
[robot bandit C] Where do
you think you're going?!

19
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:15,583
[multiple blades slicing metal]

20
00:03:41,375 --> 00:03:42,750
Luna.

21
00:03:55,791 --> 00:03:57,791
[Leda] And after I went
out of my way to fix it

22
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:59,833
up all nice and new.

23
00:04:01,958 --> 00:04:03,416
[Dio]
Leda.

24
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:07,666
I don't... want it...

25
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:08,916
I told you.

26
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,833
I know... but still,

27
00:04:11,916 --> 00:04:17,041
fact remain is you'll eventually
stand above all robotic life.

28
00:04:17,125 --> 00:04:19,875
[Leda] You can't do that
with a broken body.

29
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:24,833
[Dio] I'd look...
identical to him.

30
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:32,791
Try to force it
on me once again

31
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,833
and I'll break them both off.

32
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,291
[Leda scoffs quietly]

33
00:04:42,625 --> 00:04:44,000
[Leda]
Dio.

34
00:04:50,916 --> 00:04:53,250
Your wound has already healed.

35
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,708
Your youthful body
is in excellent form.

36
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:08,833
You... are absolute perfection.

37
00:05:14,458 --> 00:05:15,583
[Leda]
Dio?

38
00:05:15,666 --> 00:05:20,250
Someday...
I myself will ruin...

39
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,958
Do you still think I'm perfect?

40
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:27,458
Someday...? That may as well
be a millennium from now.

41
00:05:27,541 --> 00:05:30,208
In these times most
individuals possess a fear

42
00:05:30,291 --> 00:05:32,625
of sudden and inescapable death.

43
00:05:34,416 --> 00:05:36,375
[Leda lightly chuckles]

44
00:05:37,916 --> 00:05:41,333
Except... the one
and only Casshern.

45
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,208
[Dio tenses]

46
00:05:46,208 --> 00:05:49,666
[Leda]
Casshern... is special.

47
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:51,541
[Dio grimaces]

48
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:56,416
[Leda] Casshern...
he was the

49
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,458
one who made
it to Luna then.

50
00:05:58,541 --> 00:05:59,666
[Dio angrily grunts]

51
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:02,625
He's the one
who killed her...

52
00:06:02,708 --> 00:06:04,458
...and as a result...

53
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:07,500
...he was the one who
gained eternal life.

54
00:06:08,666 --> 00:06:10,250
[shattering rock]

55
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,458
[Dio breathes heavy]

56
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:25,708
[Leda]
Dio.

57
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:31,833
You have the ability to

58
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:35,166
become greater than
Casshern ever was.

59
00:06:36,833 --> 00:06:38,791
It is your... destiny.

60
00:06:43,125 --> 00:06:45,541
[Leda] Robots of all walks
of life have amassed

61
00:06:45,625 --> 00:06:48,791
here in response to your call...

62
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,375
That is your army down there.

63
00:06:52,458 --> 00:06:56,083
[Leda] It's time you stood
before them and declared...

64
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:59,833
...that you intend to create
a new robotic empire.

65
00:07:03,541 --> 00:07:07,750
The same as Braiking
Boss did before.

66
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:12,291
It will...
surpass all other empires.

67
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:14,333
[Dio reacts surprised]

68
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:21,458
What they seek is not
an empire but eternal life

69
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:24,666
which can only be
granted by Casshern...

70
00:07:24,750 --> 00:07:26,708
...and not by me.

71
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,333
My partner has acquired
another bad habit...

72
00:07:46,416 --> 00:07:48,791
How unfortunate.

73
00:07:48,875 --> 00:07:51,125
[Leda]
However... Dio...

74
00:07:51,208 --> 00:07:54,916
We've come too far
to stop now.

75
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,250
[Leda] If you only knew what
a wonderful symbol you

76
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,000
would make for the Robot Empire.

77
00:08:01,416 --> 00:08:04,250
Eternal life and an empire...

78
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:06,708
Both of them will be mine.

79
00:08:15,083 --> 00:08:18,041
[wind blows]

80
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:32,666
But you are no
longer alive...

81
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,000
Why is that...? Luna?

82
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,708
[Luna]
For you and all the

83
00:09:00,791 --> 00:09:03,916
hard work you
do every day.

84
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,458
[Luna]
Thank you.

85
00:09:21,125 --> 00:09:22,500
Luna.

86
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,666
[robot bandit E]
Move it!

87
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:35,708
[robot bandit E] We traveled for
weeks just to be stood up...?

88
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:37,166
We've been out here
all day and he hasn't

89
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:39,000
even shown his face!

90
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,500
[robot bandit F] Was all this
talk of an army a lie...?

91
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,875
I'm not sure he's even
serious about defeating

92
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:46,083
Casshern and stopping the ruin.

93
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,291
[robot bandit E] If this bastard
Dio doesn't hurry we'll all be

94
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:50,875
ruined before it even begins!

he tries to stand up]

Luna!

99
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:49,125
[Dune] Luna passed away...

100
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:53,041
[Dune bellows]
WHY?!!

101
00:10:53,125 --> 00:10:54,416
[robot bandit E]
You!

102
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,125
[robot bandit E]
Silence!

103
00:10:56,208 --> 00:10:58,125
[robot bandit F] We're already
irritated as it is...

104
00:10:58,208 --> 00:11:01,250
Your whining
isn't helping things!

105
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:05,000
Why... Luna?

106
00:11:05,083 --> 00:11:08,041
[robot bandit E] Are you
hard of hearing? Huh?!

[robot bandit H] What the
hell'd you do that for?

110
00:11:32,833 --> 00:11:34,708
Sweet Luna.

111
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:36,208
[Leda thinks]
That's Dune...

112
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,916
Luna's personal guard.

113
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:41,333
[robot bandit I] Luna? The girl
who was murdered ages ago?

114
00:11:41,416 --> 00:11:44,375
[robot bandit J] I've heard
rumors that she's still alive.

115

Luna.

116
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:08,625
[Dio thinks] So...
it was him after all.

117
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:14,000
[Dio thinks]
How pathetic...

118
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:15,291
Ensnared in the past

119
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:18,333
and still incapable of
overcoming it...

120
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:20,208
What a disgrace.

121

[metal being dragged]

122

Luna!

123
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:38,750
Just like...
my own... self.

124
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:42,500
[Dio] No... The one I should be
focused on destroying is...

125
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,458
[Dune cries out]

126
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,708

[Dune cries out]
[metal being sliced]

128
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,000
My my Dune...

129
00:13:16,083 --> 00:13:18,041
You haven't changed.

130
00:13:25,708 --> 00:13:28,083
It was said that Luna
employed the God of Death

131
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,208
as her protection,

132
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,916
and that he was
feared by all.

133
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,958
Disliked by friends
and colleagues...

134
00:13:35,041 --> 00:13:37,708
...he watched over
Luna from afar...

...Dune the God of Death.

136
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,208
There wasn't one
living soul who wanted

137
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,625
to get close to you.

138
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:51,208
[Leda] It's obvious you still
possess your strength...

139
00:13:51,291 --> 00:13:53,083
...and for that reason I
would love for you

140
00:13:53,166 --> 00:13:57,250
to join us... but that
doesn't seem feasible.

141
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:01,125
[Leda] You've lost your sanity
over the years, haven't you...?

142
00:14:01,208 --> 00:14:06,583
Allow me to facilitate...
your eventual ruin right now.

143
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:08,250
[blades colliding]

144
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,000

Why...? Tell me why!

00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,250
[Leda]
Dio!

147
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:08,666
[Dune]
Why... Luna?

148
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:12,875
Dune... You are no longer
the God of Death...

149
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:15,375
...but a mere phantom.

150
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:19,166
Dio... Your body
hasn't fully healed!

151
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,750
Yes... but don't worry Leda.

152
00:15:22,833 --> 00:15:24,625
[Dio] I'll finish him off
along with the past

153
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,583
he can't forget.

154
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:30,916
Why?

155
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:34,291
[Dio] Luna's death
was necessary...

156
00:15:34,375 --> 00:15:37,333
In order for robots
to rule over the world.

157
00:16:12,041 --> 00:16:14,541
I know you.

158
00:16:14,625 --> 00:16:17,583
[Dune]
Yes... You're...

159
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,625
You killed... Luna.

160
00:16:28,750 --> 00:16:32,333
I'm right... You're the
one who killed her!

161
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,666
Damn you... Casshern!

162
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:42,041
Casshern...! You'll die
where you stand...

163
00:16:42,125 --> 00:16:44,875
...for I'm the God of Death!

Dio.

[Dio]
You're no different.

166
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:57,375
[Dio] All you see when
you look at me is Casshern.

167
00:16:57,458 --> 00:16:59,791
[Dio]
I am not him!

Casshern!

00:17:41,375 --> 00:17:44,958
Dio...! Can't you
see he's through?

172
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:50,666
Stop it, that's enough already.

00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
[Dune]
Cass... hern.

174
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,666
What was...

00:18:02,916 --> 00:18:05,708
Dio.

176
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:08,750
Listen... You're the
one I've chosen.

177
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,791
Please understand me...

178
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:21,250
Dio... I've chosen you.

179
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,791
Just you... and not Casshern.

180

Okay?

[robot bandit L]
Look! Up there!

183
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,541
[Dio] To all of you who
have graced me

184
00:19:11,625 --> 00:19:13,708
with your presence. 

185
00:19:13,791 --> 00:19:17,916
I am here to tell you
I will put an end to the ruin...

186
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:22,250
I will also defeat Casshern and
attain eternal life as a result.

187
00:19:24,250 --> 00:19:26,375
Hear me...! I will become...

188
00:19:26,458 --> 00:19:28,958
...the second coming
of the great Braiking Boss...

189
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:29,958
...and will create a world

190
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:32,708
where us robots
can truly thrive!

191
00:19:35,125 --> 00:19:36,916
As long as you
follow my lead...

192
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,166
every one of you will never
have to fear death again!

[crowd cheers]

00:19:46,541 --> 00:19:48,916
[Leda thinks] Although
this army is strong,

195
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,708
it won't be enough
to take down Casshern...

196
00:19:51,791 --> 00:19:54,541
We must increase
its size ten-fold.

[robot bandit I] Luna? the girl
who was murdered ages ago?

00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,833
[robot bandit J] I've heard
rumors that she's still alive.

[crowd continues to cheer]

00:20:04,333 --> 00:20:07,625
[Leda thinks] There's simply no
way Luna could be alive.

201
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,000
[Leda thinks] I'll need to make
sure I wipe out anything

202
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:18,041
and everything that could
potentially stand in my way.

203
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,666
[Casshern thinks]
If Luna is alive...

204
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:53,375
...I must find a
way to see her...

205
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:56,708
All of the answers
I seek lie with her.

206
00:20:58,083 --> 00:21:00,041
[Casshern thinks]
I will find her.
