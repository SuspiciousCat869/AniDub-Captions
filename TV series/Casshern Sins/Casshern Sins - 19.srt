[Lyuze thinks]
Casshern's eternity...

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:19,291
...is my ruin.

00:02:01,083 --> 00:02:04,208
[Lyuze thinks]
The wind... so dry...

5
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,041
The world is dying
little by little...

6
00:02:07,125 --> 00:02:12,500
...like a sand dune...
slowly eroding in the breeze...

7
00:02:12,583 --> 00:02:15,750
Luna... are you out there...?

8
00:02:15,833 --> 00:02:18,208
Will you really save us?

This ground's unstable.

[Ringo]
Casshern! Lyuze...!

15
00:02:56,833 --> 00:02:58,166
Come quick look!

16
00:02:58,250 --> 00:02:59,333
Look look look!

17
00:02:59,416 --> 00:03:01,791
Over there...
I think I found it...

18
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,125
You know the castle!

40
00:06:22,875 --> 00:06:25,458
[Helene]
How pathetic...

41
00:06:25,541 --> 00:06:29,791
There isn't any value
in fighting you at all.

42
00:06:29,875 --> 00:06:31,083
The only reason you've made

43
00:06:31,166 --> 00:06:33,291
it this far is because
of him, right...?

44
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,333
In other words you're

45
00:06:34,416 --> 00:06:36,666
incapable of
protecting yourself...

46
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,166

Casshern!

00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,958
Death will be
upon you soon...

55
00:07:09,041 --> 00:07:09,958
But don't worry,

56
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:12,875
your man will be
right behind you.

[Ringo emits a shocked sound]

68
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:57,875
It's alright... did you see
something scary Ringo?

69
00:08:57,958 --> 00:08:59,041
One time...

70
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:01,500
...Ohji told me a story...
it's scary...?

71
00:09:01,583 --> 00:09:02,625
He said there's all sorts

72
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,625
of spooky monsters
living inside caves.

73
00:09:05,708 --> 00:09:06,916
[Lyuze]
It's okay...

74
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,166
We're here with you.

75
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:14,958
[Lyuze] So... What else
did Ohji tell you...?

76
00:09:15,041 --> 00:09:15,875
Anything specific?

77
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,333
[Ringo]
Huh?

78
00:09:18,166 --> 00:09:21,833
[Lyuze] Such as...
What kind of monster it was?

79
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,916
[Ringo]
Umm... He said it was

80
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,666
a snake monster
called a Hydra...

81
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:33,625
It had nine heads and
you could get rid of

82
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:36,250
eight of them but the
one in the middle...

83
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,625
the very last head
was indestructible...

84
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:40,666
so you couldn't kill it.

85
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,125
[Ringo] No matter which head
you cut off and how

86
00:09:45,208 --> 00:09:46,833
many times you did it...

87
00:09:46,916 --> 00:09:49,833
...a new head would keep
growing in its place...

88
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,541
...making the Hydra
stronger and stronger.

89
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:58,875
[Lyuze]
Wow... That's amazing.

90
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,666
[Ringo]
Doesn't it sound scary?

91
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,541
[Lyuze]
I'm jealous...

92
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:07,000
[Ringo]
Huh?

93
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:11,958
[Lyuze] Jealous
of its life force...

94
00:10:12,041 --> 00:10:17,958
Instead of decaying over time,
it becomes more powerful.

95
00:10:18,041 --> 00:10:19,833
[howling wind]

[splash]

97
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:52,666
[Lyuze thinks] Someday
my body will rot away...

98
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,666
...and turn into rust...

99
00:10:55,750 --> 00:11:00,166
Will it be a slow agony,
or instantaneous?

100
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,208
[Lyuze thinks]
Back when all I thought

101
00:11:04,291 --> 00:11:07,458
about was exacting my
revenge on Casshern...

102
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:10,541
...the ruin wasn't even
an issue with me...

103
00:11:10,625 --> 00:11:15,500
So... why do I feel
this way now?

104
00:11:15,583 --> 00:11:17,166
[metal ding]

105
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:34,791
[Ringo laughs]

106
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,166
What is this place...?

107
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,125
It's gorgeous.

108
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,166
[Casshern]
I can't believe it.

109
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:57,083
[Casshern] I'm shocked a
place like this can still exist.

110
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:01,166
Standing here it's
almost as if...

111
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,583
...the ruin never even happened.

112
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:07,541
Yeah I know.

113
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:15,625
[footstep]

114
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,166
Here 'ya go.

115
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,958
[Ringo strains as
she stretches up]

116
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,416
Maybe there's a fairy
with lots of feathers

117
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,833
here instead of a
monster with nine heads!

118
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:39,625
[Ringo]
Casshern...!

119
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,958
Let's go this way!

120
00:13:04,666 --> 00:13:06,458
[Lyuze gasps]

121
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:14,458
[Lyuze gasps and panics]

122
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,083
[wind howls]

00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,458
[Ringo gasps]

124
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,416
[Ringo]
Lyuze!

125
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:04,208
[rain hitting the ground]

126
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,458
[Casshern]
Lyuze.

127
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:19,583
[Casshern] Let's rest... You
shouldn't overexert yourself.

128
00:14:19,666 --> 00:14:20,750
I'm fine...

129
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,541
We're not too far
from Luna's castle now...

130
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:25,541
so let's keep moving.

131
00:14:27,166 --> 00:14:28,958
[Lyuze gasps]

132
00:14:32,666 --> 00:14:38,166
[Casshern] No... We'll
wait here until the rain stops.

133
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,333
Why are you doing this...?

134
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:42,708
Is it for my sake?

135
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:45,666
[Lyuze]
Because my ruin will

136
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,500
get worse if I'm exposed
to the rain for too long?

137
00:14:53,458 --> 00:14:57,375
And In this cold rain...
my body's more susceptible...

138
00:14:57,458 --> 00:15:00,541
I could simply drop
dead at any moment...

139
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:03,416
You've noticed it, haven't you?

140
00:15:07,666 --> 00:15:09,458
[Casshern]
Lyuze.

141
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:13,125
[Casshern]
Take it easy...

142
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:17,166
I'm just a little worried about
your well-being, that's all.

143
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:43,708
You can't understand
what it's like... Casshern...

144
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,750
You are so beautiful.

145
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:52,166
Just like the monster
Ringo mentioned before...

146
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,916
You're invincible... I'm not.

147
00:16:00,833 --> 00:16:05,375
[Lyuze thinks] I don't know
what I should do at this point.

148
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:08,916
[Lyuze thinks] Luna...
If I go to your castle

149
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,083
and you're not there...

150
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:14,458
...will that mean there's
no salvation left for me?

151
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,291
[Lyuze] The rain...
it's not stopping.

152
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:43,916
[Lyuze gasps]

153
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,250
[creaking metal]
[Lyuze shudders]

[metal ding]

155
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:15,875
[metal ding and echo]

156
00:17:39,083 --> 00:17:41,000
Come on what's
wrong with you...?

157
00:17:41,083 --> 00:17:44,000
Just fight me already.

158
00:17:44,083 --> 00:17:45,666
I'm confused...

159
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,000
Why are you doing this?

160
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,750
Tell me the truth...

161
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:54,666
...do I have any
worth as a fighter?

162
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:56,916
[Lyuze] That woman told
me I'm pathetic...

163
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:59,791
Said I couldn't protect myself.

164
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,833
What am I...? Nothing?

165
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,541
[Lyuze] Am I just another
one of the walking dead,

166
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:11,583
incapable of taking a stand...?

167
00:18:11,666 --> 00:18:17,125
I mean, here I am with these
strong feelings for you...

168
00:18:17,208 --> 00:18:18,583
But will I not...

169
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:21,916
...make it long enough to
see where this all goes?

170
00:18:36,666 --> 00:18:39,000
Just fight me...!

171
00:18:39,083 --> 00:18:40,666
Break me apart...

172
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,916
Destroy me.

173
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:44,666
At the very least...

174
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:46,875
...you can release me...

175
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,750
...from my suffering.

176
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:05,250
[blade impacting
into Casshern's hand]

177
00:19:12,875 --> 00:19:14,833
[Casshern] You wouldn't believe
me if I told you how many times

178
00:19:14,916 --> 00:19:17,250
I've thought the same thing.

179
00:19:48,833 --> 00:19:50,708
[Casshern]
Let's go find Luna...

180
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:52,833
What do you say?

181
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:55,791
We may not be able to

182
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,666
reverse the damage that's
already been done...

183
00:19:58,750 --> 00:20:01,916
...but we... will find
a way for you to live.

184
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:11,500
But the question is...
do I want to live?

185
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:21,708
I do want to.

186
00:20:21,791 --> 00:20:23,750
[impact]

187
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:29,125
I will not die.

188
00:20:29,208 --> 00:20:31,000
You again.

189
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:37,500
[Helene struggles and gasps]

190
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:38,958
[thud]

191
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:45,583
[Lyuze struggles to breathe]

192
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,750
I won't die!

193
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:00,625
I don't want to die.

194
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:07,333
Nor do I...

195
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:10,583
I'll live...

196
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:13,458
[glass shattering]

197
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:38,833
[Lyuze] Even if there
is no meaning or value.

198
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:55,541
Let's go...

199
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:59,333
[Lyuze]
We have lives to live.

200
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,416
[Casshern] When we
attain that which we seek...

201
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:38,041
...it becomes a brief illusion

202
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:41,500
before disappearing
into nothing.

203
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:42,833
Next time...

204
00:23:42,916 --> 00:23:46,208
For Whom Do
the Flowers Bloom?
