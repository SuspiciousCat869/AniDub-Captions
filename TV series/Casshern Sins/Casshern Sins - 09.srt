[Nico blows a petal away]

6
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,333
Bye bye petal!

[robot bandit a]
Who cares about Luna...?

10
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,625
No one even knows
where she is...

11
00:02:54,708 --> 00:02:57,083
She's a phantom!

12
00:02:57,166 --> 00:02:58,291
[heavy thud]

13
00:02:58,375 --> 00:03:00,083
[robot bandit a]
We'd put our trust in Dio...

14
00:03:00,166 --> 00:03:03,125
...before her... any day!

15
00:03:05,458 --> 00:03:06,541
[robot bandit b]
Joining the army doesn't

16
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,875
guarantee your survival.

17
00:03:08,958 --> 00:03:12,416
[robot bandit a] Your priority
should be finding Luna!!

18
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,458
[Bolton] 
Devour Casshern!

19
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:17,416
[Bolton] The only way to
obtain eternal life is to

20
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:19,458
devour Casshern!

21
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:22,583
Don't do it!

22
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:26,458
[Bloton] Attack!
Devour Casshern!

23
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,500
[robot bandits bellow in unison]
[heavy footfalls]

24
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,833
[Bolton]
Die Casshern!

25
00:03:38,291 --> 00:03:41,000
[Bolton]
Devour Casshern!

26
00:03:55,625 --> 00:03:57,416
Where am I?

27
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:59,375
[Casshern grimaces]

28
00:04:22,458 --> 00:04:24,875
[Casshern] I wonder who
put this flower here.

29
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,583
[breeze blows through]

30

[Bolton]
Damn it!

32
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:45,125
[Bolton] Why do I have
to go through this...?

33
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:47,625
I am not gonna die...

34
00:04:47,708 --> 00:04:49,166
I'm gonna join the army...

35
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,333
...and survive,
no matter what it takes.

36
00:04:52,416 --> 00:04:55,416
[Bolton utters grunts of pain]

37
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:57,208
[Bolton] I don't want
to die out here...

38
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:58,958
...not like them.

39
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,291
[Bolton shouting]
Not in such a barren,

40
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,041
depressing place like this!

41
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:07,250
[Nico]
Huh?

42
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:15,250
[Nico lightly giggles]

43
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:20,875
[Bolton lightly grunts]

44
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:29,750
[Bolton]
Who the hell are you?

45
00:05:34,875 --> 00:05:36,375
[Bolton] Are you
making fun of me brat?!

46
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,708
[Nico utters a gasp of surprise]

47
00:05:46,291 --> 00:05:48,875
[Nico]
Here... a flower.

48
00:05:48,958 --> 00:05:50,750
Pretty huh?

49
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:55,916
[Bolton shouts] I don't
want your damn flower!

50
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,458
[Bolton]
Now go!

51
00:05:57,541 --> 00:06:00,291
[Bolton] Get outta my
face you little pain!

52
00:06:03,333 --> 00:06:06,291
[Nico utters a questioning
noise and then laughs]

53
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:20,333
[Nico]
This one's for you.

54
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,375
[Nico]
I hope you like it.

55
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,416
So tell me...

56
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,333
What are you doing
here anyway?

57
00:06:27,416 --> 00:06:30,083
[Nico giggles]

58
00:06:30,875 --> 00:06:34,833
[Nico sighs and giggles]

59
00:06:37,291 --> 00:06:39,250
[Nico]
♪ La la la-la, la la... ♪

60
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:46,750
[Nico giggles]

61
00:06:46,833 --> 00:06:49,708
[Casshern thinks]
Is this girl... human?

62
00:06:49,791 --> 00:06:52,500
[Casshern thinks]
No... she must be robotic.

63
00:06:54,291 --> 00:06:56,083
[Nico]
Oh no!

64
00:06:57,416 --> 00:07:00,375
[Nico]
Your leg... it's hurt.

65
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,083
[Casshern]
It's nothing... I'll be fine.

66
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,791
[Nico]
Huh?

67
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:07,875
Don't worry...

68
00:07:07,958 --> 00:07:10,125
I'll heal on my own...

69
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,625
I always do...
for some reason.

70
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:15,833
But wait!

71
00:07:15,916 --> 00:07:18,125
[Nico] You can't
just leave it be!

72
00:07:24,291 --> 00:07:25,750
Now it's better...

73
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:27,791
It won't hurt.

74
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,583
[Bolton grunts in pain
as he struggles]

75
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,041
[Bolton continues to struggle]

76
00:07:49,166 --> 00:07:52,125
[Nico grunts as she
moves heavy metal part]

77
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:01,541
[Nico softly laughs]

78
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,250
[Nico softly laughs]

79
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:12,208
[Bolton] Look kid, a wrap isn't
going to fix anything.

80
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,583
[Bolton]
Besides, you just stuck an

81
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,833
arm on me where the
leg's supposed to go, you idiot!

82
00:08:16,916 --> 00:08:18,833
[Nico laughs]

83
00:08:18,916 --> 00:08:20,041
[Bolton fakes laughter]

84
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,375
[Bolton]
You think it's funny, huh?

85
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,916
[Casshern] Why is that girl
going around helping everyone?

86
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,833
[Casshern]
Treating my wound...

87
00:08:31,916 --> 00:08:34,125
...as well as that robot's.

88
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:38,375
Why is that?

89
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:39,750
[Ohji]
Her brain's circuitry

90
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:42,083
is fried beyond repair.

91
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:47,666
Casshern...! Of all places...

92
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,958
...why are you here?

93
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,166
[Casshern]
I saw a group of robots

94
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,583
trying to push one
of their own off a cliff,

95
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:56,083
so I tried to stop it.

96
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,125
[Ohji]
Is that right?

97
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:01,958
[Ohji] I guess those rumors
panned out after all.

98
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:03,208
[Casshern]
What rumors?

99
00:09:03,291 --> 00:09:04,291
[Ohji] This valley
we're standing in

100
00:09:04,375 --> 00:09:06,708
has been dubbed
the Grave of Robots

101
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,875
for many years now.

102
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,125
[Ohji] After the ruin
began claiming lives,

103
00:09:11,208 --> 00:09:13,125
dead robots were brought
here to be dumped

104
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,375
into mass graves.

105
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:17,416
[Ohji] I heard that many
were left here while they

106
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,958
were still alive,

107
00:09:19,041 --> 00:09:21,833
so I wanted to come
see it for myself.

108
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:24,791
So then... that girl was...

109
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,250
I don't know if she was
dumped here or not,

110
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:31,625
but whatever the case,
she's been here a long time.

111
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,291
[Ohji] From the first moment
[Nico giggles]

112
00:09:33,375 --> 00:09:36,291
I came across her she
struck me as being odd.

113
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,416
[Bolton]
Just stop it already!

114
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,208
[Bolton] I don't care how
many times you do that,

115
00:09:40,291 --> 00:09:43,125
it's not going to
fix my arm! Got it?!

116
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:46,166
[Impact crash]
[Nico winces]

117
00:09:47,416 --> 00:09:49,000
[Nico]
Oh no!

118
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,500
You alright...?

119
00:09:54,583 --> 00:09:56,166
Are you alright?

120
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,375
Not to worry...

121
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:02,666
You're in good hands.

122
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:04,750
[Nico]
Are you in pain?

123
00:10:09,291 --> 00:10:10,500
Thank goodness...

124
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:13,000
You're not hurt!

125
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:16,208
[Ohji] She's done this over
and over for years now...

126
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:20,833
These dolls and decrepit robots
being her only company...

127
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:23,583
It's really quite sad.

128
00:10:23,666 --> 00:10:24,583
But Ohji...

129
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:27,166
She seems really happy to me!

130
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,625
[Nico giggles]

131
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:33,833
[Casshern] She's done the
same thing for so very long.

132
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:37,666
Because of... the ruin.

133
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,208
[Ringo laughs]

134
00:11:09,291 --> 00:11:10,666
[Ohji]
Huh?

135
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:17,333
[Ringo]
These flowers...

136
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:19,000
[Ringo]
They're so pretty!

137
00:11:21,958 --> 00:11:24,041
[Ringo]
Did you grow them yourself?

138
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,875
And do you give the
flowers to all the others?

139
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,416
[Ringo]
I love it!

140
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:41,083
[Ringo]
Thank you!

141
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,166
Finished...!

142
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,833
Here'ya go!

143
00:11:55,041 --> 00:11:58,000
[Ringo and Nico giggle]

144
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:08,750
[Bolton grunts]

145
00:12:10,875 --> 00:12:12,375
[Bolton]
Not you again...!

146
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,500
Don't tell me you're gonna...

147
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:18,583
Ah... do whatever you want.

148
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,541
[Nico whispers]

149
00:12:23,625 --> 00:12:26,041
She said it looks
really good on you...

150
00:12:26,125 --> 00:12:28,416
Makes you look like royalty!

151
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,875
[Bolton]
Really...

152
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:53,041
[Ringo giggles]

153
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:58,541
[Ringo] Casshern...!
Come here and look at this...!

154
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,166
Nico, you too!

155
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:02,833
Up there. Check it out...!

156
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,625
I put a flower on his head...

157
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,750
Looks like a crown, doesn't it?

158
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:10,750
[Ringo] Instead of a robot
he's now a prince!

159
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,416
No, no!

160
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,750
You don't think
he could be a prince?

161
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,916
[Ringo] Do you think he's
better than a prince?

162
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,000
[Nico mumbles affirmatively]

163
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,250
[Ringo]
Well maybe he's a queen?

164

[feet landing]

165
00:13:28,458 --> 00:13:30,041
Hey there!

166
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,250
Hey to you... What's going on?

167
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,791
[Nico laughs]

168
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,541
Nico... What are you
doing here?

169
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,958
Here... it's for you.

170
00:13:52,666 --> 00:13:54,625
Why thank you.

171
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:56,291
[Casshern]
Lyuze.

172
00:13:57,083 --> 00:13:59,750
[Casshern]
Do you know that girl?

173
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:06,000
[Lyuze] Nico, she's a robot
who looked after Luna.

174
00:14:06,083 --> 00:14:07,458
Luna?

175
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,416
Were you left here...?

176
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:14,125
Tell me... Have you been here
ever since Luna died?

177
00:14:14,208 --> 00:14:16,166
[Nico giggles]

178
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:21,416
Stop laughing and
answer me!

179
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:26,458
[Nico tears up
and begins to cry]

180
00:14:29,750 --> 00:14:31,833
[Casshern]
Lyuze, she can't do it...

181
00:14:31,916 --> 00:14:34,250
Her brain's circuitry is bad.

182
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:39,708
[Nico continues to cry]

183
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,375
Let's go pick flowers.

184
00:14:44,750 --> 00:14:48,791
Nico... She was with
Luna during her final days.

185
00:14:48,875 --> 00:14:51,833
She also looked
after my sister.

186
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,250
[Lyuze]
She ended up here

187
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,708
because you went
and killed Luna!

188
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,666
[Bolton]
Killed Luna...?

189
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:02,291
When did this happen?

190
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,500
It was a very long time ago...

191
00:15:04,583 --> 00:15:07,833
[Lyuze] Her death is what
triggered the ruin.

192
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:10,291
[Bolton] If that's true...
then the stories

193
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,375
must have been lies.

194
00:15:14,291 --> 00:15:15,875
[Bolton]
There was a rumor...

195
00:15:15,958 --> 00:15:18,208
...about a woman named Luna...

196
00:15:18,291 --> 00:15:20,875
She had the power
to give life...

197
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:23,166
...to robots and humans alike.

198
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,666
That's impossible...!

199
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,791
Luna's not
alive anymore.

200
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,125
[Bolton] Well,
that doesn't change

201
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,375
the fact there was a
lot of us who believed it...

202
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,583
Some of my own comrades did.

203
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:36,333
[Bolton] We knew we
didn't have long to live,

204
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,375
because of the ruin.

205
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:39,916
[Bloton]
I guess most of them

206
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,500
just wanted to believe
the rumor was true.

207
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:44,125
[Bolton] But you can't
blame them for it...

208
00:15:44,208 --> 00:15:48,416
They thought Luna would make
the ruin stop if they met her.

209
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,708
[Bolton] But don't you
think it's a better move

210
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,166
to join Dio's army,

211
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,625
rather than desperately looking

212
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:54,500
for a woman who
no one knows about,

213
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,750
let alone where she is,

214
00:15:55,833 --> 00:15:57,166
or if she's even alive?!

215
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,666
[Bolton]
Am I wrong?

216
00:15:58,750 --> 00:15:59,833
[Bolton]
The thing is...

217
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:01,666
[Bolton yelps and
crashes to the ground]

218
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:03,541

Get this thing off me!

[Bolton] Look at me!
I'm miserable!

221
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:13,375
[Bolton] I can't even move
around on my own anymore!

222
00:16:13,458 --> 00:16:15,416
[Bolton]
I feel like a damned turtle...!

223
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,291
Go ahead and laugh!
Mock the cripple...!

224
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:19,958
I know I look like a moron! 

225
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:23,083
[Bolton] What's the point of
me being alive anymore?

226
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:27,166
[Bolton] I might as well just
sit here and wait for the ruin! 

227
00:16:29,583 --> 00:16:33,000
[Nico expresses
surprise then giggles]

Well what do we have here...?

What's the matter?

want to die that badly?
