If I were human...

[Liza] Yet through all that
you're able to create your

00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:41,291
Liza... Is that you?

158
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:46,750
[Liza] I have sinned in my life,
and that has led you astray.

159
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:50,416
[Liza] Though in hindsight,
maybe that was a good thing...

160
