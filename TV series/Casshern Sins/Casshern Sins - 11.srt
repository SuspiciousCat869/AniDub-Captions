1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,250
[Casshern] Luna...
what's in your blood

2
00:00:10,333 --> 00:00:12,291
that could have caused this?

3
00:01:56,708 --> 00:01:58,666
[metal paw scraping ground]

4
00:02:04,083 --> 00:02:06,041
[rock breaks]

5
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,458
[robot bellows as he attacks]

6
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:29,041
[robot screams out as
Friender attacks him]

7
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:18,250
[Casshern]
Friender! Run!

8
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:27,000
[debris falling after
impact followed by blast]

9
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:02,083
[Friender howls]

10
00:04:10,791 --> 00:04:13,750
[strong howling wind]

11
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:24,500
[many footfalls, murmuring
and coughing]

12
00:04:41,833 --> 00:04:43,458
[Gido]
Are you alright?

13
00:04:43,541 --> 00:04:45,458
Yes, thank you,
I'm fine... but...

14
00:04:45,541 --> 00:04:48,125
my little baby is so cold...

15
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,500
The town's just up ahead.

16
00:04:55,541 --> 00:04:57,500
[strong wind gusts]

17
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,125
[coughing in the background]

18
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,625
[Toro]
Gido.

19
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:33,708
What is it Toro?

20
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:35,833
I found something weird.

21
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,708
Oh...? What's that?

22
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:40,500
These eyes keep looking at us...

23
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:42,375
[Toro]
They're scary.

24
00:05:48,416 --> 00:05:50,375
There. You see?

25
00:05:55,125 --> 00:05:56,291
[Gido]
Huh?

26
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:03,125
Just stay back Toro.

27
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:11,333
[Toro cries out in
dismay and fear]

28
00:06:11,416 --> 00:06:13,250
[Gido]
Toro! You okay?

29
00:06:13,333 --> 00:06:14,291
[Toro]
Yeah.

30
00:06:14,375 --> 00:06:15,750
Damn!

31
00:06:16,708 --> 00:06:18,083
[Gido]
Tetsu.

32
00:06:20,583 --> 00:06:22,708
It's a robotic dog!

33
00:06:32,458 --> 00:06:33,416
[Tetsu]
Jin!

34
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:35,541
[Friender snarls]

35
00:06:35,625 --> 00:06:37,625
Look at him...
I don't believe it...

36
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,166
His body hasn't even
started ruining yet.

37
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:42,666
We were under the impression
that Jin was special...

38
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:44,541
...but this proves there are
other robots out there

39
00:06:44,625 --> 00:06:46,125
just like him.

40
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:48,875
[Tetsu]
Jin, what should we do?

41
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:51,291
[Friender continues to snarl]

42
00:06:57,958 --> 00:07:00,166
I'm sorry we
startled you.

43
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,000
[Jin] We're just staying
here for the night.

44
00:07:02,083 --> 00:07:04,041
[Jin] We'll be gone
in the morning.

45
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,791
Don't be scared.

46
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:09,125
[Friender continues to snarl]

47
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:11,000
I am not your enemy...

48
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:14,041
My friends and I have
no desire to harm you.

49
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:21,000
[Jin] Perhaps you and
I could be buddies.

50
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:24,125
[Jin] Will you be
my friend...? Please?

51
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,666
[Friender quietens]

52
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:32,416
That's excellent...

53
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,291
You understand me.

54
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,166
My group and I...

55
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:48,916
...we've been on this
journey for a long time...

56
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,958
...in search of Luna.

57
00:07:52,166 --> 00:07:53,666
You heard of her...?

58
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,666
Well... We believe she is
capable of prolonging

59
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:59,916
our lives and giving equally
to both humans and robots.

60
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,625
[Jin] My fellow travelers
include humans and robots...

61
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:06,375
Some are elderly and
some are just children...

62
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:07,958
...and among the robots,
there are those whose

63
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,666
ruin is quite advanced.

64
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:11,791
[Jin] Each and every
one of us is well

65
00:08:11,875 --> 00:08:13,833
aware of our mortality.

66
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:20,500
[Jin] We have no idea
if Luna actually exists

67
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,250
or is just a fable...

68
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,375
...but we find our best option
is to wait for hope

69
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:27,333
rather than just
accepting a slow death.

70
00:08:27,416 --> 00:08:31,666
I'm confident someday...
we will find Luna.

71
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:34,416
[Jin] That belief is the
only thing keeping us alive.

72
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,666
Why's Jin talking to
that dog over there?

73
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,000
I dunno but it looks
like it's brand new.

74
00:08:39,083 --> 00:08:40,958
If we could strip it down
I bet we'd have enough

75
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:43,208
spare parts to fix Gido's arm.

76
00:08:43,291 --> 00:08:44,166
[Gido]
What for?

77
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:45,750
Gido?

78
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:47,916
Nothing can
save me now.

79
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,875
But wait, that's not true...!

80
00:08:49,958 --> 00:08:53,916
Once we find Luna...
she'll save every one of us!

81
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,000
[Gido] We don't even
know if she exists.

82
00:08:57,083 --> 00:08:58,458
Gido.

83
00:08:59,208 --> 00:09:00,958
I've been wondering...

84
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:04,125
...if this journey of
ours has a point.

85
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:05,208
The world as we know

86
00:09:05,291 --> 00:09:07,625
it is definitely
heading towards ruin...

87
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:11,500
No one person has
enough power to stop that...

88
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,625
Maybe it makes more sense...

89
00:09:13,708 --> 00:09:15,208
...to just give in and
enjoy our last days

90
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,166
rather than waste energy.

91
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,916
Gido... You don't...
mean that.

92
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:27,333
Wow... Whoever made you
did so with great care...

93
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,125
Every single part of
you is custom made.

94
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,125
[Jin] Nothing about you
is mass-produced.

95
00:09:33,208 --> 00:09:35,750
[Jin] You can tell your creator
saw you as a labor of love.

96
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:38,583
[Tetsu] Jin. We spotted some
bandits. If any of them catch

97
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,500
wind of the humans
in our group we're screwed.

98
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:42,958
[Jin]
Right.

99
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,625
[heavy clanking footfalls]

100
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,625
[Tetsu] There's too many
of them to fight. 

101
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,041
[Tetsu]
What should we do?

102
00:09:56,125 --> 00:09:59,083
We're going to be
quiet and let them pass.

103
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:05,291
Keep moving you bandit scum.

104
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,083
[Man C]
Just leave us alone.

105
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,291
[Baby begins to fuss]

106
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:11,000
Come on be a good boy
and stay quiet

107
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,916
for your mommy.

108
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:16,291
[Baby continues to fuss]

109
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,750
[Baby begins to cry]

110
00:10:24,833 --> 00:10:27,541
[robot bandit G]
Humans...! In that cave!

111
00:10:27,625 --> 00:10:29,000
Ahh... Damn it!

112
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:38,958
[robot bandit G]
Who are those three?

113
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:48,208
Did you... see that?

114
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:50,083
[robot bandit G]
Hey look.

115
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:55,000
I[robot bandit G] It's that dog
we saw with Casshern before.

116
00:10:55,083 --> 00:10:56,291
[Jin thinks]
What?

117
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:58,750
Did he say Casshern?

118
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:00,250
[robot bandit H]
Now that your master's dead,

119
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,833
you're allowing yourself
to be tamed by humans...?

120
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,500
Stupid mutt.

121
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:06,666
[robot bandit I]
That's nothing compared to the

122
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:08,083
stupidity I see here...

123
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:09,291
Robots who have betrayed

124
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:11,958
their own race
to defend humans.

125
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,666
[robot bandit G]
Make no mistake about it...

126
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,833
That's Jin... the fool who
refused to join Braiking Boss's

127
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:19,291
empire so he could
fight on the side of humanity...

128
00:11:19,375 --> 00:11:21,000
I never believed in
a million years I'd run

129
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,541
across him in a
place like this.

130
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,000
[robot bandit G]
How pathetic.

131
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,416
[robot bandit G] Siding with
the humans is no different

132
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,625
than giving up.

133
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,416
[Jin] I choose the path
that I feel is just,

134
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,791
for the sake of both
robots and humans.

135
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,791
[robot bandit G] You really
think protecting humans is just?

136
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,916
[robot bandit J] Humans are the
sworn enemies of robots.

137
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,541
[robot bandit J] Killing
them is our only option...

138
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,000
Plus, it's good sport.

139
00:11:41,083 --> 00:11:42,458
[robot bandit G]
It's just a matter of time

140
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:44,041
until we all die anyway.

141
00:11:44,125 --> 00:11:46,916
[robot bandit G] Might as well
enjoy ourselves in the meantime.

142
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,958
[Friender growls]

143
00:11:50,291 --> 00:11:52,250
Not on my watch.

144
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,666
[robot bandits laugh]

145
00:12:00,291 --> 00:12:01,666
Mommy.

146
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,875
[Friender snarls]

147
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,291
[robot bandit G]
Enough of this nonsense...

148
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:12,625
We're spinning our
wheels by fighting each other.

149
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,833
[robot bandit G] It's not even
a fun way to pass the time.

150
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,416
[robot bandit G]
It'd be a waste of energy.

151
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,375
[robot bandit G]
Let's move on.

152
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:25,291
[Tetsu chuckles]

153
00:12:25,375 --> 00:12:27,541
[Tetsu]
They backed down.

154
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:29,083
Thank goodness.

155
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:36,750
[Toro]
Where's Gido?

156
00:12:38,208 --> 00:12:40,583
I don't see
him anywhere!

157
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:41,833
[Tetsu]
Really?

158
00:12:41,916 --> 00:12:43,458
[Dai] I wonder where
he could've gone...

159
00:12:43,541 --> 00:12:45,000
Let's go look.

160
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:48,916
[Jin] 
Hey! Where are you going?!

161
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,458
[Dai]
Follow him!

162
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:05,541
Is that...? What's he
doing up there?

163
00:13:06,875 --> 00:13:08,833
[Friender scratching the ground]

164
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,750
[Tetsu] You don't think Gido's
under there, do you?

165
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,083
[Jin]
I don't know,

166
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:19,833
but it looks like
something is down there.

167
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:21,750
[Jin] Dai! Tetsu!
Let's go for it!

168
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,208
[in unison]
Right!

169
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,208
[Dai]
Jin, we're all set!

170
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:45,208
Alright... I want everyone
to take cover behind

171
00:13:45,291 --> 00:13:47,250
those rocks right now!

172

[massive explosion]

173
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,500
Did it work?

174
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,833
[Toro]
Gido!

175
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,125
[Tetsu] What's he doing
with those bandits?

176
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:26,916
[Dai] Don't tell me
you've betrayed us!

177
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,625
[Gido] I haven't
betrayed anyone.

178
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,458
[Gido]
I'm here to help us.

179
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,333
What do you mean by that?

180
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:35,583
Buried underneath here
is our only chance of

181
00:14:35,666 --> 00:14:37,083
surviving the ruin...

182
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,791
It's Casshern,
he can save us all!

183
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:41,083
[Dai]
Casshern?

184
00:14:41,166 --> 00:14:42,458
[Tetsu]
It couldn't be!

185
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,333
[Gido] I'm sure you've all
heard the rumors...

186
00:14:44,416 --> 00:14:46,208
If you eat Casshern,
then the ruin in your

187
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:47,666
bodies can be reversed...

188
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:50,458
Our best option is to eat
Casshern now instead of

189
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,250
pinning our hopes on
finding Luna when

190
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:53,041

[Friender howls]

194
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,375
[robot bandit G]
It's Casshern!

195
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:22,250
[robot bandit H]
He's alive!

196
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,833
[robot bandit G] We have
the numbers to take him!

197
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,166
[robot bandit H] Then let's
devour him before the others

198
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,541
get their chance!

199
00:15:29,625 --> 00:15:31,583
[robot bandits bellow
as they attack]

200
00:15:55,583 --> 00:15:57,708
So you're the fabled Casshern.

201
00:15:59,333 --> 00:16:00,791
No, stop it!

202
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:09,833
I am not your enemy...
now stand down!

203
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,166
[Jin]
Listen to me!

204
00:16:30,791 --> 00:16:32,375
Friender.

205
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,458
I can't believe it's him...

206
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:51,166
The rumors were true after all.

207
00:16:51,250 --> 00:16:53,583
So the ruin will end
if we eat Casshern?

208
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,833
Yeah... Not only that,
it will also extend our lives.

209
00:16:57,916 --> 00:17:00,708
[Toro]
So... we could save Gido?

210
00:17:00,791 --> 00:17:02,625
[Man C] I had never
heard about this.

211
00:17:02,708 --> 00:17:05,083
[Man D] We should at
least give it a shot.

212
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:14,166
[Man C]
Jin you could...

213
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,083
Wait... hold on...

214
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:18,416
Just think about it...

215
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,208
You could save Gido's
life and everyone else's too.

216
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:24,208
Are you saying you that want
me to murder Casshern?

217
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,250
[Man D] This is a huge
opportunity for us.

218
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,625
[Man D] If we don't
we'll not only lose any

219
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:30,458
chance of saving Gido,
but also our own lives.

220
00:17:30,541 --> 00:17:32,291
But we shouldn't have
to resort to violence,

221
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,000
not if we can find Luna.

222
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:36,041
She's not real!

223
00:17:42,708 --> 00:17:44,083
Luna?

224
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:47,750
Just do it... For your
friends and family.

225
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:49,208
[Man E]
You're our only hope!

226
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:50,083
[Man E] 
Please Jin,

227
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,750
Gido's counting on you. 

228
00:17:51,833 --> 00:17:53,041
[Woman B]
Who's more important...?

229
00:17:53,125 --> 00:17:54,375
Us or this Casshern?

230
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:55,500
[Man C]
Please Jin.

231
00:17:55,583 --> 00:17:57,666
[Man D] Jin!
You have to do it for us.

232
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,541
[Group]
Please!

233
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,958
[Friender howls]

234
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,666
I can't go through with it.

235
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,333
But why?

236
00:18:18,416 --> 00:18:20,666
I refuse to
sacrifice a life...

237
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,208
...just so that we
may ensure our own...

238
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,375
[Jin] I'm sorry if
I let you down.

239
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,583
[Jin] The human who created
me taught me something...

240
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:34,125
To do what is just...
for humans and robots alike...

241
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:38,500
You see... I want to go back...
to a world where humans

242
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,541
and robots can live side
by side in peace...

243
00:18:41,625 --> 00:18:44,291
That's why I won't
give up on Luna.

244
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,750
[Jin] From what we've heard,
Luna shares life equally

245
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,166
between humans and robots.

246
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:53,250
[Jin] No inequality. Let's not
forget that's the whole reason

247
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,833
we decided to search for
her in the first place.

248
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,375
[Jin] And If we do reach our
goal, then we will no longer

249
00:18:58,458 --> 00:19:00,625
be held back by the
fear of death...

250
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,208
...we can all live
normal lives.

251
00:19:04,291 --> 00:19:09,208
Agreed...? That is a world I
think we can all believe in.

252
00:19:09,291 --> 00:19:10,750
Luna isn't real...

253
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:13,625
I'm getting tired of all
these damned rumors!

254
00:19:13,708 --> 00:19:15,416
[Jin]
But Casshern is real.

255
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:18,750
And Remember,
he's part of the rumor as well.

256
00:19:18,833 --> 00:19:20,666
Casshern is real so it
wouldn't make sense

257
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:22,166
for Luna not to be.

258
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:25,916
We will find Luna...
I believe that.

259
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:30,166
I... I...

260
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:34,416
[Toro]
Gido.

261
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,666
Toro.

262
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:37,500
You were always there
to protect me when

263
00:19:37,583 --> 00:19:39,000
I needed you most...

264
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:41,500
You'll always
be my friend.

265
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:45,166
You have to live...
I don't want you to die.

266
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:47,125
[Toro] So... I don't
care what it takes.

267
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:49,583
I'm gonna fix you.

268
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,625
Toro.

269
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:54,000
I'll work really hard
and get bigger and stronger

270
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:55,791
so I can fix you.

271
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,250
I promise you... kay?

272
00:19:59,333 --> 00:20:02,375
Thank you son... Thank you.

273
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,916
[Jin]
That's the spirit, Toro.

274
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:05,750
[Jin] That's all you can do,
because only humans

275
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,291
can cultivate maturity.

276
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,291
You'll be grown up
quicker than you think...

277
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,250
...and can help Gido.

278
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,000
[Tetsu] I think
I just figured out

279
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:19,750
why Jin isn't
affected by the ruin.

280
00:20:19,833 --> 00:20:23,166
[Dai] Me too... It's
because of his convictions.

281
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:25,666
Maybe if we had a
firm belief in something...

282
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,416
...the ruin would stop
dropping us like flies.

283
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,250
The same goes for that dog.

284
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,791
Yeah, sure does...

285
00:20:31,875 --> 00:20:33,875
[Dai]
He has conviction too...

286
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:36,958
An unflinching devotion
towards his master.

287
00:20:39,750 --> 00:20:42,708
A man with
conviction... huh?

288
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:46,791
You looking for Luna?

289
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:48,416
Yes.

290
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:52,708
[Jin] But you're immortal
why look for her?

291
00:20:53,458 --> 00:20:55,375
That's true...

292
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:57,875
But I must find her.

293
00:20:57,958 --> 00:20:59,583
[Jin]
Well in that case...

294
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:02,041
...maybe we should...

295
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:05,458
No... forget it...

296
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:07,250
If we team up...

297
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:11,208
...I'm afraid I'll try to
kill you someday.

298
00:21:11,291 --> 00:21:12,375
[Jin]
And if that happened,

299
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,875
I'd be going up against
the likes of you,

300
00:21:13,958 --> 00:21:16,166
which I don't want.

301
00:21:16,250 --> 00:21:17,875
With Friender?

Ahh I see...

303
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,083
So that's your name.

This is goodbye...
