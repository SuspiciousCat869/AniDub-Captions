1
00:00:11,708 --> 00:00:13,666
[Casshern]
I am Casshern.

2
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,208
[Ohji] This city
repaints its history...

3
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,416
When the king changed,

4
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:02,250
the city's history
changed as well...

5
00:02:02,333 --> 00:02:05,666
...and it was painted
in the new kings colors.

6
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,000
[Ohji] At least... That's
the way it used to be here.

7
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,375
[Ringo laughs with excitement]

8
00:02:13,458 --> 00:02:15,416
[Ohji sighs to himself]

9
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:18,125
[Ringo laughs]

10
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:23,625
Ohji!

11
00:02:23,708 --> 00:02:25,916
[Ringo laughs]

12
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,333
[Ohji] A queen
once lived here...

13
00:02:28,416 --> 00:02:31,958
She was known as
the Goddess of Healing.

14
00:02:45,458 --> 00:02:47,250
[Ringo whimpers]

15
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:52,666
[Ohji] Casshern...
Insects that fly at

16
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:56,000
night are drawn
towards the moon...

17
00:02:56,083 --> 00:02:57,875
But the moon
does not smile

18
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:01,500
and the insects fall
to the ground and die...

19
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:05,833
As the world continues
to grow ever more quiet.

20
00:03:09,333 --> 00:03:12,541
[Ohji] Are you still
searching for Luna?

21
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:40,708
[Casshern]
What is this place?

22
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,125
Luna!

23
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:49,541
Luna. Luna. Luna.

24
00:03:49,625 --> 00:03:51,458
Luna. Luna. Luna.

25
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,375
[Casshern] Tell me...
Do you know Luna?

26
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:55,833
Luna!

27
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:06,166
[Beard man] Luna, the goddess
who negates death.

28
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,041
[Beard man] Looking back I wish
I'd never heard about her.

29
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:13,083
[Beard man] If I hadn't I could
have given up by now.

30
00:04:15,041 --> 00:04:18,291
[Beard man] I take it
you are... Casshern.

31
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:21,666
[Robot boy A utters
a frightened gasp]

32
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,875
You're Casshern?

33
00:04:23,958 --> 00:04:25,958
Yes, I am.

34
00:04:26,041 --> 00:04:28,000
In the past this lake
was a source of

35
00:04:28,083 --> 00:04:29,708
healing for us...

36
00:04:29,791 --> 00:04:31,625
Now it is a grave
for us to bury our

37
00:04:31,708 --> 00:04:34,416
parts and ruined circuits.

38
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,250
[Beard man] If you are not
willing to accept death...

39
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,208
...then leave.

40
00:04:45,083 --> 00:04:46,958
Come... Friender.

41
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,375
[Margo]
Hmm...

42
00:05:14,833 --> 00:05:16,208
[rubbing stone sound]

43
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,166
You there...

44
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:24,041
Watch your step.

45
00:05:34,958 --> 00:05:36,333
Hey!

46
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:40,375
[Margo laughs]

47
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:43,125
Amazing! Your body
looks brand new!

48
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,875
This totally
made my day...!

49
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,500
Your entire body is
just like a work of art!

50
00:05:47,583 --> 00:05:48,791
[Margo]
See, I'm an artist,

51
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,791
and I feel a sort of
sympathy towards you.

52
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:52,250
Okay...

53
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,458
[Margo]
Alright, alright, alright.

54
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:01,666
Please excuse me
for that sudden outburst.

55
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,500
I'd like to use the
inspiration you've given

56
00:06:03,583 --> 00:06:06,375
me while it's
still fresh in my mind.

57
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:09,166
[Casshern] So I take it
you've yet to give up on

58
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:11,208
the future of this world?

59
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:16,958
[Margo] Artists by nature tend
to be very stubborn... and...

60
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,291
...we want to leave
our mark on history.

61
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:24,208
[Margo] I may not have the
power to end the ruin...

62
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:26,916
but through my painting
I can leave a legacy

63
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,958
behind for history to judge.

64
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,166
[Margo] So young man
who fears death...

65
00:06:38,250 --> 00:06:41,500
Let's go find out what
it really means to live.

66
00:06:43,375 --> 00:06:45,958
[electric wheelchair
travels over rocky dirt]

67
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:08,750
[metal clanking]

68
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,833
[Margo]
It sure has been awhile.

69
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,333
[Margo] I don't think I've been
here since I lost my legs.

70
00:07:19,416 --> 00:07:22,375
[scraping]

71
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:26,333
[[Margo] This is it. Just like
layers of sediment, this proves

72
00:07:26,416 --> 00:07:28,375
the king of each era
painted the town in the

73
00:07:28,458 --> 00:07:30,125
color of their choosing.

74
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:31,791
See?!

75
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:36,583
[Margo] Each individual
color represents a different

76
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:38,500
king who ruled
over this land...

77
00:07:38,583 --> 00:07:40,083
Just because they've
been painted over

78
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,750
numerous times doesn't
mean they were

79
00:07:41,833 --> 00:07:44,500
never here,
and this proves that.

80
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,500
Proof of their very...
existence.

81
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:56,416
So tell me... would you
agree with the saying that...

82
00:07:56,500 --> 00:08:00,083
...life is determined
by how it is lived?

83
00:08:00,166 --> 00:08:02,791
[Margo] The way to live is
by dwelling in the now...

84
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:04,875
and not fretting about
the future and what it

85
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:07,000
may or may not hold...

86
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:09,041
That is the key to life.

87
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:15,083
[Margo]
Now look.

88
00:08:16,250 --> 00:08:18,791
[Margo] Do you see
this dark color?

89
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:23,250
That is the era ruled
by Lord Braiking Boss.

90
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,333
[Margo]
The color elicits power...

91
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:32,791
His era was one of terror,
filled with oppression...

92
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,541
but in all the chaos,
there was order.

93
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:46,291
[footsteps marching in unison]

94
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:04,500
His vision of
order was beautiful...

95
00:09:04,583 --> 00:09:07,208
...in his own twisted
and demented way.

96
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,208
[Margo] Once Lord
Braiking Boss left...

97
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:17,333
...the city no longer
had a king...

98
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,583
...so nature took it upon
itself to paint the town

99
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:22,458
one final time in the
color of sand.

100
00:09:35,083 --> 00:09:39,083
Well enough of that...
I've babbled on far too long.

101
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:41,416
[Margo] It's time I got back
to my work. As much as

102
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:43,958
I'd like it, the city
can't re-paint itself...

103
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:45,833
Please excuse me.

104
00:09:55,333 --> 00:09:58,208
Braiking Boss... I see.

105
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:03,625
[Margo]
Hey!

106
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,416
[Margo] 
Will you give me a hand?

107
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,875
I could use some help
getting down the stairs.

108
00:10:08,958 --> 00:10:10,750
[Margo chuckles]

109
00:10:19,208 --> 00:10:21,750
[Casshern] Even though the
ruin will be upon him soon...

110
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,500
...he refuses to give in...
to his ultimate fate.

111
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:41,208
It sure is odd, Friender.

112
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:42,583
[Casshern]
What I should do is

113
00:10:42,666 --> 00:10:46,875
leave immediately and
continue searching for Luna.

114
00:10:46,958 --> 00:10:51,416
But I'm just... fascinated
with seeing him finish this.

115
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,041
It's a silver road?

116
00:11:09,125 --> 00:11:11,916
Close but that's
not quite it.

117
00:11:12,666 --> 00:11:14,583
[Margo]
At last it's complete...

118
00:11:14,666 --> 00:11:17,208
'The Road that
Leads to the Sun'!

119
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,125
I have finally reached
my life's goal of

120
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,000
re-painting history!

121
00:11:30,125 --> 00:11:34,166
[Casshern] I have no
recollection of the past.

122
00:11:34,250 --> 00:11:36,166
[Casshern]
I don't know who I am...

123
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:40,500
Nor do I know if the life
I led before was virtuous.

124
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,583
Like you've done here...

125
00:11:44,666 --> 00:11:47,583
you've repainted
an entire era...

126
00:11:47,666 --> 00:11:49,125
I must stick to my

127
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,375
convictions and keep moving
along the path I feel is right.

128
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:55,125
For that is the
only way I will ever

129
00:11:55,208 --> 00:11:57,166
know my true self.

130
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,791
You are wise
beyond your years...

131
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:08,875
Stick to the path and
you will find yourself.

132
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,250
[Robot boy A cowers in fear]

133
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:48,208
The path towards
hope is truly divine.

134
00:12:55,208 --> 00:12:56,541
[Beard man] Enough
with this nonsense

135
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:59,041
you're talking... Margo.

136
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,375
Oh hello there everyone...

137
00:13:00,458 --> 00:13:02,125
it's good to see you.

138
00:13:02,208 --> 00:13:04,000
[Margo] Is there something
you wanted to discuss?

139
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,500
You damn noble creature...

140
00:13:06,583 --> 00:13:07,875
Just accept it...

141
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,291
...accept the ruin with
the rest of us!

142
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:13,541
I'm sorry?

143
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,250
You are a nuisance...

144
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,791
your presence...

145
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,875
...disrupts our order
and our hearts... get him.

146
00:13:20,958 --> 00:13:22,875
[Margo utters fearful sounds]

147
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,041
[Robot fighter A]
What are you hoping to

148
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,875
achieve with this
silly project of yours?

149
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:27,916
[Margo cries out as he is hit]

150
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:32,666
[Robot fighter B] If you know
what's good for you you'll

151
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,041
give in to your fate!

152
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,083
[Robot fighter A]
The ruin is inescapable.

153
00:13:37,833 --> 00:13:39,291
Why have you given up...?

154
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,041
I don't see the point
in living if you've

155
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:42,416
accepted your death!

156
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:43,291
[Robot fighter A]
 Silence!

157
00:13:43,375 --> 00:13:45,333
[Margo cries out as he is hit]

158
00:13:45,416 --> 00:13:48,375
[Margo cries out as he beaten]

159
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,375
[Robot fighter A]
This color pisses me off!

160
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,416
[Robot fighter A yells]
[wall crumbles]

[Robot fighter C] The ruin's
already come this far.

162
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:02,750
[Robot fighter A breathes heavy]

163
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,625
[Robot fighter A]
People like you are pathetic...

164
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:07,125
You don't deserve to live!

165
00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:09,208
But you're wrong...

166
00:14:09,291 --> 00:14:11,333
As long as we
are still living,

167
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:14,208
can we no longer
believe in hope?

168
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,458
[Beard man]
That's enough...

169
00:14:15,541 --> 00:14:16,666
Now accept the ruin

170
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,416
peacefully along with
everyone else...

171
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,916
[Beard man]
You follow, Margo?

172
00:14:37,166 --> 00:14:39,875
What do you
think you're doing?

173
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,208
[Beard man laughs]

174
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:45,791
We're upholding the order
he continues to agitate.

175
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,250
[Beard man] Give in to the ruin
and quietly await your death...

176
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:50,833
Allowing just one person

177
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:54,208
to disrupt the regulations
will not be tolerated.

178
00:14:58,083 --> 00:15:00,083
What's wrong with
believing in something...?

179
00:15:00,166 --> 00:15:02,541
What's wrong with having hope?

180
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,416
Put simply there is no
longer a need for

181
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,416
this city to be repainted.

182
00:15:13,083 --> 00:15:15,333
[Beard man] It is our
duty to accept our fate,

183
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,750
which is death by ruin.

184
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:20,375
Really...? I mean...

185
00:15:20,458 --> 00:15:23,291
How... can you give
up so easily?

186
00:15:23,375 --> 00:15:24,750
[Beard man]
Silence.

187
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,208
[Robot fighter A]
You aren't like us...

188
00:15:27,291 --> 00:15:28,708
Your body is void of decay,

189
00:15:28,791 --> 00:15:31,250
so don't try to empathize
with how we feel!

190
00:15:31,333 --> 00:15:33,666
[Robot fighter A]
You could never understand.

191
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:34,541
[Robot fighter C]
Ruin will kill us

192
00:15:34,625 --> 00:15:36,833
whether we have
hope or not.

193
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:39,375
[Robot fighter B] Submitting to
reality is our only choice...

194
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:41,416
Hope cannot save us!

195
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:54,666
No. Stop...! I...

196
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,500
Now join us and relish
in the serenity of ruin.

197
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,791
[nails scrape the wall]

198
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,625
[Casshern struggles for calm]

199
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:20,875
[Robot figher screams
out as he attacks]

200
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,916
[slicing ding of metal
as robot fighter cries out]

201
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,291
So it's true...

202
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,791
You are Casshern...
the bringer of death

203
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:46,333
who set the world
upon the path of ruin.

204
00:16:48,208 --> 00:16:51,916
No... You're wrong...
I am...

205
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,916
[Casshern struggles]

206
00:17:05,958 --> 00:17:08,625
[Casshern] I'm sorry
about all this.

207
00:17:10,875 --> 00:17:12,833
It was my fault.

208
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:23,708
[Margo] Well...
I can always do it again.

209
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:27,166
History will always
be painted over...

210
00:17:27,250 --> 00:17:29,208
...until the end of time.

211
00:17:47,916 --> 00:17:49,791
[Margo sighs]

212
00:17:49,875 --> 00:17:51,458
[Margo]
So foul.

213
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,625
A history that is
written by warfare

214
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,750
is ultimately ugly.

215
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:02,541
[Margo] I assume that is
why the previous rulers...

216
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,916
...all tried in vain to
cover the errors of the past

217
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,875
with their own colors.

218
00:18:10,458 --> 00:18:14,416
I suppose I'll be content
with letting nature cover it...

219
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:16,500
The same as the Sun
that was named Moon

220
00:18:16,583 --> 00:18:18,666
would have wanted as well.

221
00:18:18,750 --> 00:18:21,000
Wait a minute,
do you know Luna?

222
00:18:21,083 --> 00:18:23,625
Well I've never seen her...
but I have heard that

223
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:26,916
she'd been to this city
once long ago...

224
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,958
Apparently she's quite
fond of the city...

225
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,750
and said she would
prefer it to remain

226
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:34,791
the same color that
nature had given it.

227
00:18:37,875 --> 00:18:42,250
I was hoping...
to ask a favor...

228
00:18:42,333 --> 00:18:43,458
Would you...

229
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:45,791
...be so kind as to
paint me in my color?

230
00:19:05,916 --> 00:19:07,458
Well I'll be damned...

231
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:10,375
I didn't think the ruin
would catch me so quickly.

232
00:19:10,458 --> 00:19:13,458
[metal giving way and falling]

233
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:21,208
This would explain
the aching I've felt lately.

234
00:19:23,625 --> 00:19:26,291
[Margo] Please...
Paint me with my color.

235
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,750
Or perhaps...

236
00:19:38,833 --> 00:19:40,750
You would like
to pick the color?

237
00:19:43,208 --> 00:19:46,791
I remember earlier you
said you have no memory...

238
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:50,833
The thing is...
memories build up and...

239
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:54,625
The time that we spent
together will become one...

240
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:58,625
I beg you...
don't forget about me.

241
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:04,291
[Margo] Overcoming the ruin
is a fight that can't be won...

242
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,208
...but not being remembered...

243
00:20:06,291 --> 00:20:09,250
...by anyone...
would be a great tragedy.

244
00:20:13,291 --> 00:20:16,583
All I had ever wanted
in life was to...

245
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:20,458
leave my own color...
on my city.

246
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:50,458
[Casshern] Margo...
soon your city will be awash...

247
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,333
...in the color you chose.

248
00:20:56,875 --> 00:20:58,958
[Casshern thinks] Luna wished
for the city to stand in the

249
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:01,416
color that
nature had given it...

250
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:04,458
But does that mean
accepting the ruin is just?

251
00:21:14,333 --> 00:21:17,750
[Margo] What exactly were
you trying to say Luna?

252
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,333
He's pretty... I wonder if he
lived his life to the

253
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:28,666
fullest before he died.

254
00:21:30,041 --> 00:21:31,875
Maybe...

255
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:33,750
I wouldn't doubt it.

256
00:21:35,333 --> 00:21:39,125
Ohji... I hope the snow
on his hair never melts away.

257
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:48,500
[Casshern] As snow
falls from the sky...

258
00:21:48,583 --> 00:21:50,791
...memories drift into
the heart and pile

259
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,833
up over time...

260
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,500
...but the snow we
call memories never melts...

261
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:58,458
Margo...

262
00:21:58,541 --> 00:22:01,000
I will never forget you.

263
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:06,750
♪ closing song ♪

264
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:35,041
[Casshern] Those individuals
whose pasts are

265
00:23:35,125 --> 00:23:37,125
shrouded in darkness...

266
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:40,166
...will be impaled by
their cruel truths.

267
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,375
Next time...

268
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:45,083
The Past Rises Before my eyes.
