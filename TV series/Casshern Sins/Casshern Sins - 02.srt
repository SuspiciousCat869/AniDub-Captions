[CASSHERN] I don't know

to the world around me.

Tell me what the ruin is...

happening to this world.

[SPIKEY HAIR ROBOT]
Thank you Doctor... 

171

on my back just yet.

This is the ruin?

174
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:41,291
[DOCTOR] Iron oxide has slowly
begun to overwhelm our bodies.

175
00:11:41,375 --> 00:11:44,166
Most no longer accept
spare parts or repairs.

176
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:47,916
And building new robots
is impossible now.

But why?

178

I don't know why.

179
00:11:52,166 --> 00:11:56,333
The one thing we do know is
that the ruin is... inescapable.

Are you saying the
ruin can't be stopped?

181
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:03,125
Yes... but... I heard
something recently...

182
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:04,666
That we can be saved

183
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,500

called Casshern...

just a silly rumor.

[CLATTERING]

186
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,333
[DOCTOR] I don't believe there's
any reason for the ruin to stop.

187
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:25,166
[DOCTOR] I felt alive for
the first time in my life

188
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,458
when I realized that
I would fall to ruin.

189
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:32,666
Because in order to die...
you must have life.

190
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:34,916
Robots, who were once
considered eternal,

191
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:39,458
gained a level of humanity
when they obtained death.

192
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,458
We should accept death,
just like humans do.

193

Everyone who came here

194
00:12:43,625 --> 00:12:47,166
was in agreement
with that philosophy.

195
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,583
Together we will await
our final days peacefully,

[CASSHERN]
Why's that?

205
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,916
[DOCTOR] Because...
you have more life in you

than all of us combined.

any effect at all on Friender.

he'll be all by himself soon.
