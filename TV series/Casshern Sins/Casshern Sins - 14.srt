1
00:00:08,333 --> 00:00:10,541
[drip of water hits
puddle followed by rain]

2
00:00:16,458 --> 00:00:18,833
Believe me it's
not your fault...

3
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:22,875
It's okay Casshern...
you didn't do anything wrong.

4
00:00:32,666 --> 00:00:33,916
[Casshern]
Stay back...

5
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,708
Don't get any closer to me!

6
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:14,666
Luna... I stole all
the life from her.

7
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,041
[Braiking Boss] That's right...
You did kill her...

8
00:02:22,125 --> 00:02:25,083
...the Sun that
was named Moon.

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:29,791
[Braiking Boss] The question is,
what will you do now...?

10
00:02:29,875 --> 00:02:33,041
Will you put that immortal 
body of yours to work?

11
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:36,958
How will you make good
on the myriad of sins you've

12
00:02:37,041 --> 00:02:39,291
committed on this world?

13
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,125
Casshern.

14
00:02:48,708 --> 00:02:50,291
[foot falls in the distance]

15
00:02:50,375 --> 00:02:53,208
[Ringo short of
breath and panicked]

16
00:02:53,291 --> 00:02:54,958
[Ringo near crying]

17
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:56,708
Don't blame him...

18
00:02:56,791 --> 00:02:59,250
...it's not his fault!

19
00:02:59,333 --> 00:03:01,125
[Ringo weeps]

20
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:03,875
It's funny...

21
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:06,791
Children have no concept
of beating around the bush...

22
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,958
They cut straight to
the heart of the matter.

23
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:12,000
[Braiking Boss chuckles]

24
00:03:12,916 --> 00:03:14,791
[Braiking Boss] I'll be the
first to admit that creating

25
00:03:14,875 --> 00:03:17,458
Casshern and having
Luna assassinated...

26
00:03:17,541 --> 00:03:20,000
were for our
own selfish reasons.

27
00:03:20,083 --> 00:03:23,041
[Ringo short of breath
as she runs]

28
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,541
But if I hang around
this kid any longer,

29
00:03:25,625 --> 00:03:28,875
my dying breath will
be here before I know it...

30
00:03:28,958 --> 00:03:30,250
Casshern...

31
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,708
I'd be careful if I were you.

32
00:03:32,791 --> 00:03:34,750
[Braiking Boss chuckles
under his breath]

33
00:03:41,083 --> 00:03:42,583
[Ohji]
Ringo!

34
00:03:42,666 --> 00:03:45,625
Ringo...! Ringo!

35
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,375
[Ohji]
Ringo!

36
00:03:58,375 --> 00:04:02,291
[Ringo sobs lightly]

37
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:06,083
[Robot woman A]
Don't cry.

38
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:08,125
You may be sad now...

39
00:04:08,208 --> 00:04:11,208
...but sadness
doesn't last forever.

40
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:15,000
Now... Stand up little one...

41
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:17,375
You should come
along with us.

42
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:23,083
With you...? But where?

43
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,291
[Robot woman A]
To Luna.

44
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,333
What?

45
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:31,500
Luna... She can heal
everyone's hearts...

46
00:04:31,583 --> 00:04:33,666
It's a true miracle.

47
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:37,791
[Robot woman A] And that is why
we're all trying to find her.

48
00:04:37,875 --> 00:04:41,041
Luna... can heal?

49
00:04:41,125 --> 00:04:44,958
[Robot woman A] Yes...
she can heal everyone.

50
00:04:45,041 --> 00:04:46,791
Casshern too?

51
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,666
[Robot woman A]
Casshern...?

52
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,708
Is that a friend of yours?

53
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,791
If he is in pain like
all the rest of us...

54
00:04:55,875 --> 00:04:57,208
...then...
there's a good chance

55
00:04:57,291 --> 00:04:59,875
he's already well on
his way to finding her.

56
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:14,583
Up there... it's the
city that Luna is in.

57
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,458
If we find her...

58
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,791
She'll save us
from the ruin.

59
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:22,125
[crackling of rusted metal]

60
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:24,125
Come here...

61
00:05:24,208 --> 00:05:26,333
I'll take you to
see Luna myself.

62
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,166
[Ringo giggles under her breath]

63
00:05:30,583 --> 00:05:33,541
Ringo! Ringo!

64
00:05:40,291 --> 00:05:43,583
[Ohji] Looks like they're all
heading towards the city.

65
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:45,666
[Ohji]
They're being tricked...

66
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:49,583
...by an imposter
using Luna's name.

67
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:54,333
Ringo...! Ringo...!

68
00:05:54,416 --> 00:05:55,875
Ringo!

69
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:59,791
Will I be able to see
Casshern if I go to the city?

70
00:05:59,875 --> 00:06:03,083
Of course... I'm sure
he'll be there.

71
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,000
So... these people...

72
00:06:05,083 --> 00:06:07,583
They're all gonna
see Luna too?

73
00:06:07,666 --> 00:06:10,375
Yes... And once they do...

74
00:06:10,458 --> 00:06:13,083
...they will all be
free from the ruin.

75
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,458
[Ohji] Ringo...!
Are you there...?

76
00:06:16,541 --> 00:06:18,500
Ringo, answer me!

77
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:25,041
[Ohji] Where the hell'd
she run off to?

78
00:06:25,125 --> 00:06:28,916
Are you around here... Ringo!

79
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:42,708
[Leda] That is the city where
Luna is rumored to be staying.

80
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:46,416
[Leda] Word is both humans
and robots alike

81
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,625
are flocking there at
the chance to see her.

82
00:06:50,166 --> 00:06:52,750
[Robot bandits yell out
as they attack]

83
00:06:53,416 --> 00:06:55,416
[Robot bandit A]
She's all mine!

84
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,833
What is this...?

85
00:06:56,916 --> 00:06:59,375
I never gave any orders.

86
00:06:59,458 --> 00:07:03,791
[Leda] They're just trying to
impress you, that's all.

87
00:07:03,875 --> 00:07:07,041
[Leda] Think of it as a
sign of their loyalty.

88
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:08,875
[Leda] Everyone you see
gathered below is

89
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:11,000
either a human or
a robot who has

90
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:13,583
outlived their usefulness.

91
00:07:13,666 --> 00:07:16,333
Killing them
would be a favor.

92
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,541
[Leda] It's no different
for the imposter

93
00:07:19,625 --> 00:07:21,791
pretending to be Luna.

94
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,083
[Leda] Casshern
already killed Luna.

95
00:07:33,166 --> 00:07:35,583
[Leda] She couldn't
possibly be alive.

96
00:07:43,625 --> 00:07:45,875
[Ohji]
Ringo? Ringo...!

97
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,875
I know you're
here somewhere!

98
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,958
If you can hear me
then say something...

99
00:07:50,041 --> 00:07:51,083
Ringo!

100
00:07:51,166 --> 00:07:53,208
[Robot man A fearful]
No...! Please!

101
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:57,500
[metal smashing into rock]
[Robot man A lets out breath]

102
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,708
[Robot bandit B] Which one of
you is claiming to be Luna?

103
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,666
[Robot bandit C]
It's no use hiding.

104
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,791
[Robot bandit B] Let's just kill
them all and get it over with.

105
00:08:05,958 --> 00:08:10,958
[screams from the crowd
as they are attacked]

106
00:08:17,958 --> 00:08:20,416
[Ohji]
Ringo, where are you?!

107
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,041
Dammit Ringo...!

108
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,708
Answer me!

109
00:08:25,541 --> 00:08:26,916
[Robot woman A wails]

110
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,375
[Robot woman A]
Help! Save me, Luna!

111
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:32,458
[Robot woman A] Save me!
I'm not ready to die...!

112
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:36,083
Not yet... Please,
I'll do anything you ask!

113
00:08:36,166 --> 00:08:37,791
[Robot woman A]
Anything! Please!

114
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,625
[Robot woman A]
Just don't let me die!

115
00:08:39,708 --> 00:08:41,583
[metal snapping]

116
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:53,000
[Ringo shudders in fear]

117
00:08:59,416 --> 00:09:01,375
[Robot bandit C
chuckles with an evil tone]

118
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,625
Where are you!

119
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:25,333
[Ohji]
Ringo!

120
00:09:25,416 --> 00:09:28,041
Ohji!

121
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:29,916
Ringo!

122
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,125
Help me!

123
00:09:31,208 --> 00:09:33,000
[Ohji bellows]

124
00:09:41,625 --> 00:09:44,208
[Leda]
Your power is ultimate...

125
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,291
There is not a being

126
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:47,791
in this world who
surpasses you...

127
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:50,125
Soon your power will
be greater than even

128
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:52,250
Braiking Boss himself...

129
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:55,291
Today marks the
first step towards that. 

130
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:57,416
This isn't my power...

131
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,333
You're the one who
made this army...

132
00:09:59,416 --> 00:10:01,333
...just admit it.

133
00:10:01,416 --> 00:10:03,208
[Leda]
You're wrong...

134
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,958
They came here
because of you.

135
00:10:09,166 --> 00:10:12,583
They have come here
to serve their savior, Dio...

136
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:15,750
To be ruled by
the mightiest of kings.

137
00:10:15,833 --> 00:10:18,791
Maybe so... but I'm
not the mightiest.

138
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,708
In order to attain the
crown that's been

139
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,625
bestowed upon me...

140
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,083
...first I must prove myself

141
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,833
by defeating the
strongest of them all.

142
00:10:27,583 --> 00:10:30,166
[running foot falls and a
building rage from Dio]

143
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,000
[Dio]
Casshern!

144
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:49,541
I will fall prey to madness

145
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:52,000
and massacre the innocents...

146
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:54,833
I will annihilate
the entire world.

147
00:10:54,916 --> 00:10:56,500
[Friender howls]

148
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,875
[Braiking Boss]
What's wrong...?

149
00:11:14,958 --> 00:11:16,833
Why the hesitation?

150
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:19,750
The old you would

151
00:11:19,833 --> 00:11:22,291
have charged in there
blind as a bat...

152
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:24,791
Acting without
even thinking.

153
00:11:24,875 --> 00:11:31,375
I don't want...
to kill... Not anymore.

154
00:11:32,958 --> 00:11:36,958
There will be more
deaths if you do nothing.

155
00:11:38,875 --> 00:11:40,708
[Braiking Boss]
Sooner or later...

156
00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:44,291
Everyone dies... though...

157
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:48,333
...you do seem to be
the exception to that rule.

158
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:56,541
[Braiking Boss] Me... I have no
interest in who lives or dies. 

159
00:11:56,625 --> 00:11:57,875
[Braiking Boss] Whether
you choose to save

160
00:11:57,958 --> 00:12:00,291
them is entirely on
your shoulders.

161
00:12:07,166 --> 00:12:08,416
[Braiking Boss]
I could go on,

162
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,250
but the last thing I want
is for you hate me more

163
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:14,000
than you already do...
see you around.

164
00:12:18,708 --> 00:12:20,666
[Lyuze]
What are you doing?

165
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:23,875
You're just standing
there... frozen...

166
00:12:23,958 --> 00:12:26,083
Meanwhile there are
lives at stake...

167
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:29,125
Not just men and women
but children too.

168
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,875
Children...? But I...

169
00:12:40,208 --> 00:12:43,875
[Ringo's voice over flashback]
Believe me it's not his fault...

170
00:12:43,958 --> 00:12:46,208
Oh poor Casshern...

171
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,791
[Robot bandit foot falls]
[Panicked crowd noise]

172
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,833
[smashing glass and thud]
[Ringo cries out]

173
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,875
[Robot bandit D]
It's him!

174
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,250
[Robot bandit E] It's time we
paid you back for the lives--

175
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:12,125
[Robot bandit E
let's out a gasp]

176
00:13:12,208 --> 00:13:14,125
[mangling of metal]

177
00:13:14,208 --> 00:13:16,458
[explosion of metal
on the ground]

178
00:13:19,125 --> 00:13:20,916
[Robot bandit D]
What the...

179
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,333
[Robot bandit E]
It's Casshern!

180
00:13:25,416 --> 00:13:26,666
[Robot bandit G]
Casshern?

181
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:27,875
[Robot bandit H] Think of
the credit we would get

182
00:13:27,958 --> 00:13:29,666
for destroying him!

183
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,708
[Robot bandit I]
You're mine, Casshern!

184
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,583
[Robot bandit J] Where's the
one calling herself Luna?

185
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,166
[Robot bandit J]
If you make me ask you again,

186
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,041
I won't hesitate
taking your head.

187
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:43,250
[Robot bandit J chuckles]

188
00:13:43,333 --> 00:13:46,916
Luna...? You killed
all these people...

189
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,875
...for no reason?

190

[blade dings at it's unsheathed]
[Robot bandit J lets wails]

[metal dings as blade slices
through robot bandits.]

192
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:11,375
I do not believe in God
or a higher power...

193
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:14,083
...but I'm grateful
for this blessing.

194
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,708
[Leda] It's Casshern...

195
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:24,166
[Leda] Dio wait!

196
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:26,500
[Dio] I never imagined I would
have the opportunity to

197
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:30,250
settle things so soon after
recovering from my wounds.

198
00:14:36,833 --> 00:14:38,416
[Leda]
Dio.

199
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:56,541
[Casshern] Did you
force them to do this?

200
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:57,708
[Dio] Yes.

201
00:14:57,791 --> 00:14:59,750
And for what purpose?

202
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:02,958
Simple...

203
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,666
To see you once again.

204
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:06,000
[Casshern]
What?

205
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:09,000
[Dio] Believe me, it's not
exactly what I planned,

206
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:11,333
but the end result
is the same...

207
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:16,875
...and it's exactly
what I had hoped for.

208
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:23,541
[Leda to herself] Now if he can
find a way to defeat him.

209
00:15:25,958 --> 00:15:27,833
[Braiking Boss]
Casshern and Dio...

210
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:31,833
Born together in the
same place and same time...

211
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:35,875
But which will carve his
place in the annals of destiny?

212
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,916
[Braiking Boss laughs
in an evil manner]

213
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:46,333
[Dio]
You and I...

214
00:15:46,416 --> 00:15:48,875
...we were born for
the same purpose...

215
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:51,208
Given identical
powers...

216
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,916
Our eyes, nose,
ears and mouth...

217
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,333
Our arms and legs...

218
00:15:55,416 --> 00:15:56,833
Every part of our bodies

219
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:59,875
were created under the
same set of specifications,

220
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:02,500
giving us
matching abilities.

221
00:16:05,083 --> 00:16:06,416
[Dio]
Yet somehow,

222
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:09,250
no matter what the situation,
you were always a step

223
00:16:09,333 --> 00:16:10,916
ahead of me...

224
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,458
Like the time you killed Luna...

225
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:14,833
Well I'm sick and tired of

226
00:16:14,916 --> 00:16:17,333
continually looking
at your back.

227
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:22,875
[Dio] Soon I will be the
one leading the way.

228
00:16:28,625 --> 00:16:30,583
[Dio]
By striking you down!

229
00:16:33,041 --> 00:16:36,875
[Dio] I will prove to you
how powerful I really am!

230
00:16:36,958 --> 00:16:38,916
[impact explosion]

231
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,041
Would killing me
really satisfy you?

232
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,833
Definitely...

233
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,583
When you breathe
your last breath...

234
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,958
...I will be known as the
strongest being by every

235
00:16:51,041 --> 00:16:53,666
inhabitant of this world.

236
00:16:53,750 --> 00:16:57,583
[Casshern] And if that satisfies
you, would you stop killing?

237
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,250
What's that?

238
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,416
If you swear to me...

239
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:05,583
...that you will never
harm another life...

240
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,333
...then I will promise

241
00:17:07,416 --> 00:17:09,708
to give up my
own life for you.

242
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:11,625
No.

243
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:14,375
How dare you mock
me you bastard!

244
00:17:14,458 --> 00:17:18,958
However... if you refuse to
end your violent ways...

245
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:21,208
...I will have to fight you...

246
00:17:21,291 --> 00:17:22,791
To the death...

247
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,916
And I will defend those
who are dying of ruin.

248
00:17:28,875 --> 00:17:31,833
[massive explosion]

249
00:17:58,750 --> 00:17:59,875
[Casshern] It's
the only way for me

250
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:02,500
to atone for the sins
I have committed...

251
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:03,958
For killing Luna...

252
00:18:04,041 --> 00:18:06,625
For sending the
world into ruin.

253
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,541
[Dio] You speak
of atonement...?

254
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,708
It doesn't matter how
many times you repent,

255
00:18:10,791 --> 00:18:11,916
it won't change the fact

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,500
that you are responsible
for Luna's death...

257
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,791
...nor will it erase the
humiliation you've caused me!

258
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,583
[Ringo cries out]

259
00:18:21,666 --> 00:18:22,916
[Ohji grimaces as rocks fall]

260
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,375
[Lyuze]
Ringo!

261
00:18:26,458 --> 00:18:29,083
Mind your own
business little girl.

262
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:35,541
[Casshern grimaces]

263
00:18:42,208 --> 00:18:45,166
[impact collisions and fighting]

264
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,375
[Dio grimaces]

265
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:54,791
[Leda thinks]
His wound...

266
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:56,875
I knew it was too soon...

267
00:18:56,958 --> 00:18:59,083
If the army sees any
sign of weakness,

268
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,125
it could spell disaster.

269
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,375
[Dio]
Stay out of this!

270
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,708
Do you intend to
just watch her die?

271
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:17,000
[Casshern]
Lyuze!

272
00:19:17,083 --> 00:19:18,458
What was that for...?

273
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,541
I haven't lost this fight!

274
00:19:20,625 --> 00:19:21,750
[Leda]
I know...

275
00:19:21,833 --> 00:19:24,958
...but it'd be best
if we fell back for now.

276
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:29,208
[Leda] Our goal today
was to find the imposter

277
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,416
pretending to be Luna.

278
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:32,791
[Leda]
Since we can't find her,

279
00:19:32,875 --> 00:19:36,541
there's no reason to
press our luck by staying here.

280
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:52,583
[Braiking Boss] Damn you Leda,
I'm tired of your meddling.

281
00:19:52,666 --> 00:19:54,250
I don't get it...

282
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:57,416
Why throw so much
support behind Dio...?

283
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,291
Just exactly what have
you been planning?

284
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:07,250
Thanks Casshern.

285
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:09,458
Now wait...

286
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:12,541
Don't just assume
I have forgiven you...

287
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:15,000
But if... you say
you're going

288
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,041
to commit to
protecting the weak...

289
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,416
and you actually help
out all of those affected

290
00:20:19,500 --> 00:20:22,041
by the ruin...
Then I'll...

291
00:20:22,125 --> 00:20:23,958
Lyuze.

292
00:20:24,041 --> 00:20:26,458
If the Luna you killed
is alive somewhere...

293
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:29,833
If there's even a slim
chance of that being true...

294
00:20:29,916 --> 00:20:34,458
Then this world may...
have a shot at making it.

295
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:38,250
And that's why...
I refuse to let you die!

296
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:43,750
I'll make sure
you keep fighting...

297
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:46,166
until everyone has
been saved...

298
00:20:46,250 --> 00:20:48,041
It's my duty.

299
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:56,541
[Ohji] Don't you want to
go with them, Ringo?

300
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,208
I can't...

301
00:20:59,375 --> 00:21:02,208
Not without you.

302
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,458
[Ohji]
So sweet.

303
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,875
You're a good girl...

304
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:07,541
Always were.

305
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,791
[Ringo]
Will they ever find Luna?

306
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,041
[Ohji]
Even if they do find her,

307
00:21:18,125 --> 00:21:21,708
I don't see this ending
happily for everyone.

308
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,041
But all I can
ask of the future...

309
00:21:24,125 --> 00:21:28,375
...is to live my last days
with you... sweetheart.

310
00:21:36,166 --> 00:21:39,125
[foot falls and tired masses]

311
00:21:51,583 --> 00:21:53,250
Hello everyone.

312
00:21:53,333 --> 00:21:56,541
I would like to
thank you all for coming.

313
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:58,166
I am Luna...

314
00:21:58,250 --> 00:22:00,125
Your savior.

315
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:36,458
[Casshern] There lived a
man who sought out the sun...

316
00:23:36,541 --> 00:23:39,291
...which had shone
brilliantly in the past...

317
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:42,750
...even after his
body was ruined.

318
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,375
[Casshern]
Next time...

319
00:23:44,458 --> 00:23:46,875
...the God of Death, Dune.
