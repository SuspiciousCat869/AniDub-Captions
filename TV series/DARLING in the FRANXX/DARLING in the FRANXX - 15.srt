[ZERO TWO gasps]

311
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:51,416
[ZERO TWO gasps]

312
00:17:57,541 --> 00:18:03,458
[ZERO TWO screams]

313
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:05,583
[ZERO TWO]
I didn't want to forget.

314
00:18:05,666 --> 00:18:11,166
Because... I thought if I did,
then I would never be human.

315
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,041
[ZERO TWO]
The first word I learned was

316
00:18:20,125 --> 00:18:23,791
how he referred to himself: "I."

317
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:26,916
After that came "Zero Two."

318
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,458
And then, the third was...

319
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:33,166
And that way I can
always be... your darling.

320
00:18:35,458 --> 00:18:36,958
[ZERO TWO]
"Darling."

321
00:18:42,416 --> 00:18:47,041
Darling! Darling! Darling!

322
00:18:49,375 --> 00:18:52,333
[HIRO]
You never forgot, did you?

323
00:18:52,416 --> 00:18:55,125
Y'know, I think I've
taken a liking to you.

324
00:18:55,208 --> 00:18:56,958
How would you feel
about being my darling?

325
00:18:57,041 --> 00:19:00,750
After all, you are
now my darling!

326
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:03,333
[HIRO]
Even as you were hurt so badly,

327
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:07,541
you kept fighting this
world all by yourself.

328
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:18,166
[ZERO TWO gasps]
Darling?

329
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:19,750
[HIRO]
I finally got to see you!

330
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:22,375
No! Don't look!

331
00:19:22,458 --> 00:19:25,166
Aren't you scared of me?

332
00:19:25,250 --> 00:19:29,250
After all, you know I
used you this entire time.

333
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:31,541
That doesn't
matter anymore, okay?

334
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,083
But I... I called you fodder!

335
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,875
How can you ever forgive
me for saying that?

336
00:19:35,958 --> 00:19:38,666
And I called you
a monster, remember?

337
00:19:38,750 --> 00:19:41,083
So now we're even.

338
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:44,666
That's right. I am a monster!
That's why you--!

339
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:48,208
No it's not!
We've gotta talk it out!

340
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:50,583
You and I have to
think it through!

341
00:19:50,666 --> 00:19:52,958
There must be places
we have to go!

342
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,958
Our journey begins now!

343
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,500
Surely this world
is much, much larger!

344
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,083
Larger than we can imagine!

345
00:20:00,166 --> 00:20:04,166
We couldn't do it back then,
but this time, I know we can!

346
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:07,416
Let's see the outside
world together!

347
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:11,583
Zero Two. Together, we are one.

348
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,750
[ICHIGO]
How much longer, Hiro?

349
00:20:22,041 --> 00:20:22,750
[FUTOSHI]
Oh, crap!

350
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:24,166
[IKUNO]
Strelizia!

351
00:20:29,166 --> 00:20:31,041
[KOKORO]
Look!

352
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:32,916
[ICHIGO]
What's that light?

353
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,041
Doctor...

354
00:20:34,125 --> 00:20:35,583
[FRANXX]
He did it!

355
00:20:44,833 --> 00:20:46,416
[ALL]
Strelizia!

356
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:49,291
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

357
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,958
[ZERO TWO]
Darling!

358
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,416
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

359
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:57,541
[ZERO TWO] Darling! Darling!
Darling! Darling!

360
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:09,291
[ZERO TWO]
Darling! I'm so happy I met you!

361
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,583
[ZERO TWO]
I love you!

362
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:15,958
[HIRO whimpers, chuckles]

363
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,500
[HIRO]
Zero Two! I feel the same!

364
00:21:19,583 --> 00:21:22,541
I love you, too!

365
00:21:22,625 --> 00:21:24,791
Cut the comms
next time, dumbass.

366
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:25,833
Seriously.

367
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:29,250
[MIKU]
Yeah. Right? Stupid idiots!

368
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,500
[ICHIGO]
I'm happy for you. You both.

369
00:21:32,583 --> 00:21:34,791
[HIRO] Zero Two, we need
to destroy that dome.

370
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:35,958
Think we can?

371
00:21:36,041 --> 00:21:38,625
[ZERO TWO]
If we're together, of course!

372
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,666
[9'a] Well, then.
Shall we get going, too?

373
00:21:46,041 --> 00:21:48,375
[HIRO yells]

374
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:54,416
[ZERO TWO, HIRO]
Go!

375
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:11,041
[9'a]
It's time. Let's do this!

376
00:22:11,125 --> 00:22:12,375
[SPECIAL FORCES]
Yeah!

377
00:22:29,791 --> 00:22:31,208
[KOKORO]
Oh, wow.

378
00:22:33,791 --> 00:22:35,500
[APE VICE CHIEF]
The door to the Gran Crevasse

379
00:22:35,583 --> 00:22:37,500
has been opened.

380
00:22:37,583 --> 00:22:42,666
[PAPA] The day of humanity's
liberation is upon us.

381
00:22:42,750 --> 00:22:45,916
[HIRO] The Jian, also known as
"the bird that shares wings"...

382
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:48,083
[ZERO TWO]
...only possesses one wing.

383
00:22:48,166 --> 00:22:49,833
[HIRO]
Unless a male and female pair

384
00:22:49,916 --> 00:22:51,625
lean on each other
and act as one...

385
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:53,583
[ZERO TWO]
...they're incapable of flight.

386
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:56,791
They're imperfect,
incomplete creatures.

387
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:57,833
[ZERO TWO, HIRO]
But...

388
00:22:57,916 --> 00:22:58,583
[ZERO TWO]
...to me...

389
00:22:58,666 --> 00:22:59,875
[HIRO]
...to me...

390
00:22:59,958 --> 00:23:02,041
[ZERO TWO, HIRO]
...their way of life...

391
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:05,916
...struck me as
profoundly beautiful.

392
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,875
[9'g]
Hey, look at that.

393
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:17,000
[9'e grunts] They won't let
it end so easily, huh?

394
00:23:17,083 --> 00:23:19,500
[9'y] Is that a collective
mass of cores?

395
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:20,958
[9'b]
Damn, that's huge.

396
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:24,250
[9'a] We're out of time.
We better get out of here.

397
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:27,000
Before this entire area blows.

398
00:23:27,083 --> 00:23:28,625
Zero Two. Let's go!

399
00:23:28,708 --> 00:23:30,541
[ZERO TWO]
Hm!

400
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:31,875
[ZERO TWO gasps]

401
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:40,208
[9'a chuckles]
Wow, an instant reaction.

402
00:23:58,916 --> 00:24:01,041
[GORO gasps]
We're still alive.

403
00:24:01,125 --> 00:24:02,958
[IKUNO]
But what was that thing?

404
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,791
[ICHIGO]
A... massive hand?
