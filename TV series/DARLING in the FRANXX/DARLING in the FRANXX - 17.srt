Hiro.

160
00:10:17,791 --> 00:10:20,958
[MITSURU] I don't understand
what Kokoro's thinking.

161
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,958
It makes no sense.

162
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:27,708
I see. You know,
you've changed a little bit.

163
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,125
Until just recently,

164
00:10:31,208 --> 00:10:34,208
you'd always been distancing
yourself from the rest of us.

165
00:10:34,291 --> 00:10:35,583
[MITSURU gasps]

166
00:10:35,666 --> 00:10:39,166
Of course, it's my fault
you were doing that.

167
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,875
I'm the reason, aren't I?
Because I broke our promise.

168
00:10:45,791 --> 00:10:49,291
[HIRO] But now you've taken
an interest in someone else.

169
00:10:49,375 --> 00:10:51,708
You want to know Kokoro better.

170
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:54,375
You want to understand
what she's thinking.

171
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:58,625
Wait, you think, I want
to know her better?

172
00:10:58,708 --> 00:11:02,666
Uh-huh. That's what it
means to love someone.

173
00:11:04,083 --> 00:11:07,916
I mean, I love Zero Two
and wanna know her better.

174
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:19,291
[MITSURU] Oh. So that's what
this is. I love Kokoro.

175
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,416
Sorry if I'm mistaken.

176
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,583
Your situation
could be different.

177
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,083
I only know how it is for me.

178
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:30,458
It's okay. I think that's
very much like you.

179
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,250
I'm glad that we talked.

180
00:11:37,333 --> 00:11:39,666
We haven't done this
in a long time.

181
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,083
Oh! There he is!

182
00:11:44,166 --> 00:11:45,333
[BOTH]
Hm?

183
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:50,333
We heard about you...
and her. Blame Zorome.

184
00:11:50,416 --> 00:11:52,625
I have to say, I'm not
the least bit surprised.

185
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:55,291
Hey all I did was casually
ask if a boy and girl

186
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:57,500
getting touchy-feely was
some sorta cool thing to do!

187
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,541
That's enough!
Stop being such a baby!

188

Mitsuru! Tell me,
did you... kiss her?!

189
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,458
[MITSURU]
Uh, well...

190
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:12,333
Not my Kokoro! Someone wake
me from this nightmare!

191
00:12:12,416 --> 00:12:13,750
[IKUNO]
Settle down.

192
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:16,791
[FUTOSHI] But, if you two
are happy, who am I to...

193
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:18,375
[FUTOSHI sobs]

194
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:23,375
Oh. Hey, everybody. Do any
of you recognize this?

195
00:12:23,458 --> 00:12:24,458
[gasps]

196
00:12:25,708 --> 00:12:27,458
It looks like you do.

197
00:12:27,541 --> 00:12:30,416
Then surely you won't mind
giving us an explanation.

198
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,625
Right, Code Five-Five-Six?

199
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:36,875
[9'a] You are the one who
dropped this book, aren't you?

200
00:12:36,958 --> 00:12:38,500
But this is strange.

201
00:12:38,583 --> 00:12:41,166
It wouldn't be provided
in the study here,

202
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:44,000
and it certainly
doesn't belong to you.

203
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,791
What's the meaning of this?

204
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,375
[MIKU]
Uh, what is that?

205
00:12:47,458 --> 00:12:48,708
[ZOROME]
What's that book about?

206
00:12:48,791 --> 00:12:49,916
Well, um...

207
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,958
[KOKORO] I'm sorry for
not telling you all.

208
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:58,541
Everyone? I want to make a baby.

209
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,000
[MIKU]
A baby?

210
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,708
[ICHIGO]
Like animal babies?

211
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,416
[FUTOSHI] And how exactly
would you make one?

212
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:10,000
Wow. Okay. You are aware
Papa has banned that, right?

213
00:13:10,083 --> 00:13:13,125
[ZOROME gasps] Wait, really?
Sounds like trouble.

214
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:14,833
She tell you about this?

215
00:13:14,916 --> 00:13:16,041
[MITSURU]
Mm-mm.

216
00:13:16,125 --> 00:13:17,625
[KOKORO]
O-Okay, sure.

217
00:13:17,708 --> 00:13:20,583
But still, is it really
that terrible a thing?

218
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:25,416
I mean, this practice is how the
adults, as well as ourselves,

219
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:27,791
and every other human,
comes to be born.

220
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:29,208
Hold on.

221
00:13:29,291 --> 00:13:31,541
Are you saying that Papa
isn't the one who created us?

222
00:13:31,625 --> 00:13:32,875
[KOKORO]
I am.

223
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,583
The truth is, we're the
same as any other animal.

224
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,125
It's what we've done
since ancient times.

225
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:41,041
That's how. The way every
living thing has been keeping

226
00:13:41,125 --> 00:13:43,958
their species going for
thousands of years!

227
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:47,750
So... the reason we
have boys and girls

228
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:50,291
must be because of that.

229
00:13:50,375 --> 00:13:53,250
And... this may
be selfish of me,

230
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,541
but I want to leave
a mark on the world.

231
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,666
Leave something
behind before I'm gone.

232
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,125
[9'a]
Leave a mark?

233
00:13:59,208 --> 00:14:01,416
Yes. We've lived
our entire lives

234
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:04,125
believing we had no purpose
other than riding the FRANXX

235
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:06,416
into battle against
the klaxosaurs.

236
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:10,125
But you know what? That might
not actually be true!

237
00:14:10,208 --> 00:14:11,958
We could carry new lives

238
00:14:12,041 --> 00:14:14,833
and leave them here
as part of the future.

239
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,875
When I learned
that was possible,

240
00:14:16,958 --> 00:14:19,125
it made me feel so happy!

241
00:14:19,208 --> 00:14:21,625
--That's why--
--[9'a] Absolutely disgusting.

Huh?

I mean you. You're disgusting.

[KOKORO gasps]

245
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,625
[9'a]
This is ridiculous.

246
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:33,250
Humans have evolved and cast
their reproductive functions

247
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:37,583
aside in the process.
If you reject that,

248
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:39,666
then we will all have to
go back to conforming

249
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:41,500
to one gender or another.

250

But, what about...?

Has this thought crossed
your mind? I'm sure it has.

252
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:50,333
Gender is a pain.
An annoyance only tolerated

253
00:14:50,416 --> 00:14:52,916
for the sake of
operating the FRANXX.

254
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,250
And that's all it is.

255
00:14:55,333 --> 00:14:56,458
That's not...!

[IKUNO] A pain, huh?
Even if it is, then so what?

259
00:15:07,625 --> 00:15:10,708
[sighs] Humans also cast
away their tendency

260
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,125
to be ruled by emotions.
Especially ones like that.

261

no purpose in life.

What test? What do you mean?

Why do our bodies still have
