156
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:39,125
I remember one day at this
facility, when several children

157
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:42,041
who lived with us,
vanished without a trace.

158
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:44,291
We asked the adults about it,

159
00:10:44,375 --> 00:10:46,833
but they wouldn't
tell us a thing.

160
00:10:46,916 --> 00:10:49,291
So I eventually
came to realize...

161
00:10:51,125 --> 00:10:52,833
[HIRO]
...that none of us children,

162
00:10:52,916 --> 00:10:55,125
would ever become adults.

163
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,666
A mistletoe.

164
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:05,583
This really is the place.

165
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,291
But have I already
been here before?

166
00:11:10,208 --> 00:11:13,666
[GORO] Why did Hiro tell us
to head back without him?

167
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:16,250
I wonder where he's
running off to this time.

168
00:11:16,333 --> 00:11:17,583
[ICHIGO]
Who knows?

169
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,583
[KOKORO] Where do you
guys think we came from?

170
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,583
[ZOROME]
Huh?

171
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,583
Where'd that question
come from?

172
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:29,333
Obviously, Papa and the
other adults made us.

173
00:11:29,416 --> 00:11:31,625
Is that really
the truth, though?

174
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:32,791
[ALL sigh]

175
00:11:32,875 --> 00:11:35,875
[ZOROME] Kokoro,
you're acting kinda weird.

176
00:11:35,958 --> 00:11:37,250
[NANA]
There you are!

177
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:52,833
I've never seen
children disobey orders

178
00:11:52,916 --> 00:11:54,833
and get yelled at
like that before.

179
00:11:54,916 --> 00:11:57,375
You and your squad
truly are interesting.

180
00:11:57,458 --> 00:12:00,000
Can't you go bother
someone else?

181
00:12:00,083 --> 00:12:03,625
[9'a] How cold. The Nines and
I are going to be leaving soon,

182
00:12:03,708 --> 00:12:05,958
so what's a little
chat going to hurt?

183
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:10,000
[9'a] I hear you guys are
actually a test team.

184
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,125
One formed by Dr. Franxx.

185
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,166
Is that why they give you
so much more freedom

186
00:12:14,250 --> 00:12:17,208
than the squads from
the other plantations?

187
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:20,208
Just what kind of tests
do they have you doing?

188
00:12:20,291 --> 00:12:23,250
I'd love to hear the details.

189
00:12:23,333 --> 00:12:25,875
Only one of Iota's partners
has ridden with her more than

190
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:29,375
three times, and that's
Code Zero-One-Six.

191
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:32,416
Could that, perhaps,
be related to your tests?

192
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,041
What are you trying to say?

193
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:38,000
Ah, you finally looked
my way. If you want,

194
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,750
I can let you in
on a big secret.

195
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,791
I'll tell you what
Code-Zero-Zero Two

196
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:44,166
is really like.

197
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:45,750
[ICHIGO gasps]

198
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:49,125
She can never co-exist with you
and your other squad members.

199
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,500
Right now, she's merely
wearing a human disguise

200
00:12:51,583 --> 00:12:53,708
and pretending that she can.

201
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,041
[ICHIGO gasps]

202
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:22,833
[HACHI]
Five Moho-class.

203
00:13:22,916 --> 00:13:25,000
They aren't much
of a threat, but...

204
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:26,708
[NANA]
Why have they shown up here?

205
00:13:26,791 --> 00:13:30,041
That's the real question.
Seeing as no klaxosaur

206
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:32,791
has ever been sighted
in this area before.

207
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:36,541
Is it possible they've become
aware of what we're up to?

208
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:39,208
[HACHI]
All FRANXX, prepare to sortie.

209
00:13:40,666 --> 00:13:43,208
[HIRO]
Sorry. I'm here!

[HIRO gasps]
Zero Two, your horns.

211
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:48,333
Quit staring already.

212
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,208
Oh... Sorry.

213
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,375
[ZERO TWO]
Darling?

214
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:58,916
Let's kill a whole lot of
klaxosaurs again today.

215
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:15,583
[ZERO TWO grunts]

00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,708
[ZERO TWO]
Huh?

[ZERO TWO grunts]

218
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:25,416
Hold on!

219
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:28,291
[ICHIGO] Strelizia! Make sure
you follow the plan!

220
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,416
[HIRO]
Yeah, you're being too direct!

221
00:14:30,500 --> 00:14:32,250
[ZERO TWO]
Oh, shut up!

222
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:35,458
As long as we kill them all,
what difference does it make?

223
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,083
Hiro, check your four o'clock!

224
00:14:38,166 --> 00:14:39,291
[HIRO]
Damn it.

225
00:14:40,916 --> 00:14:42,666
[HIRO]
Zero Two! Pay attention!

226
00:14:42,750 --> 00:14:45,541
[ZERO TWO grunts]
Why, you...!

227
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:56,333
You're chasing them too far!
We have to work with the others!

228
00:14:57,625 --> 00:14:58,875
[KOKORO]
They're fast!

229
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:01,458
[IKUNO] Strelizia!
There's more coming your way!

230
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,333
[ZERO TWO]
I'll crush them all at once!

231
00:15:09,416 --> 00:15:14,041
Why aren't you listening
to me? Zero Two!

232
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,083
Damn!

233
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,416
[ZERO TWO grunts]
Darling!

234
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:20,208
Why are you getting
in my way now, too?!

235
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:25,541
[HIRO]
Fire!

236
00:15:31,125 --> 00:15:34,375
[HIRO panting]

237
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:37,333
Not sure how, but we got 'em.

238
00:15:40,166 --> 00:15:42,500
[ZERO TWO]
You damn monsters.

239
00:15:42,583 --> 00:15:45,000
Take this. And this!

240
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,666
Zero Two! That's enough!

241
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:48,250
You don't need to
hit them, anymore!

242
00:15:48,333 --> 00:15:53,625
[ZERO TWO] Damn you! I'm going
to kill every single one of you!

243
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:55,791
And become human.

00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,666
We're out of power.

245
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:04,000
[IKUNO] I think you
went a bit overboard.

246
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,750
[MIKU]
That was kinda scary.

247
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,208
[ICHIGO]
Uh...

[HIRO]
Your nails are peeling off!

00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,666
And you're covered in bruises.

[ZERO TWO]
Let go.

254
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,375
[ZERO TWO]
Kill them.

255
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:55,250
[HIRO]
What?

256
00:16:55,333 --> 00:16:59,250
I don't have much time.
I need to kill more.

257
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:02,500
So many more klaxosaurs.

I wanna hurry up
and become human.

You mentioned that earlier.
What did you mean?

[ZERO TWO] I'm going
to be human... Human.

261
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:17,708
[HIRO]
Snap out of it, Zero Two!

262
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:21,458
I have no idea why you're
so fixated on being human,

263
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,541
but you are who you are!

264
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:25,458
How you were born
doesn't matter!

265
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,583
And neither do your
horns and fangs!

266
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,208
[ZERO TWO]
Shut your damn mouth!

267
00:17:29,291 --> 00:17:31,791
[HIRO] I was attracted
to the person you are!

268
00:17:31,875 --> 00:17:34,166
It doesn't matter
whether you're human!

269
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,625
This entire time, I've been
trying to figure out why

270
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:38,583
I felt this way about you.

271
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:41,625
And after watching Goro
and Futoshi, I understand.

272
00:17:41,708 --> 00:17:43,833
I know what this feeling is!

Zero Two, I love you! I love you
exactly the way that you are!

274
00:17:52,291 --> 00:17:55,666
"Love me"? What's that mean?

00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:59,958
[HIRO grunts]

276
00:18:00,041 --> 00:18:01,708
[HIRO]
What are you--?

277
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:06,250
[ZERO TWO] Is this it? It's what
you're talking about, right?

278
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,750
Then I'll teach you what
comes after kissing.

No, that's not it--

280
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:19,250
[HIRO gasps] Stop that!
This isn't what I meant!

281
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,291
You're wrong. I was...

282
00:18:22,375 --> 00:18:27,166
This is so tedious.
Just hurry up and let it out.

283
00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:30,500
But this isn't enough.
You still have to kill more

284
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,875
of those monsters
and make me human!

After all, you're nothing
more than my fodder!

[HACHI] The detailed testing
shows that Code Zero-Zero-Two's

289
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:51,041
rate of saurification
has accelerated

290

since they became partners.

291
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,541
And Code Zero-One-Six's

the upper limit as well.
If this keeps up,

that he would no longer

00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:12,708
[9'a] Why do you think it is
that Iota came to be known

as "the Partner Killer"?

307
00:20:14,958 --> 00:20:17,041
Because she curses her partners.

It's how she drains
their lives away.

That power is what she
uses to pilot the FRANXX.
