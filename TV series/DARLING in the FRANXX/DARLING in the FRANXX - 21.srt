This is VIRM's will.

[APE VICE CHIEF]
Star Entity is a mass of life

00:02:13,625 --> 00:02:17,041
[FUTOSHI] Uh, hey! Who exactly
are we supposed to fight here?

35
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,833
[ZOROME]
The klaxosaurs, obviously!

36
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,583
That's how it's always been!

37
00:02:20,666 --> 00:02:22,916
[IKUNO] But she said the
ones that came from the sky

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,791
were invaders.

39
00:02:24,875 --> 00:02:27,333
[KOKORO] It doesn't
matter who the enemy is.

40
00:02:27,416 --> 00:02:29,500
All I can do is fight.

41
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:33,458
[FRANXX] Since the
detonation stalled once

42
00:02:33,541 --> 00:02:36,250
Code Zero-One-Six connected...

43
00:02:37,708 --> 00:02:39,041
[FRANXX]
It's a backdoor code.

44
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:40,875
Backdoor code?

45
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,083
[FRANXX] It's targeting
the Stampede mode.

46
00:02:43,166 --> 00:02:44,916
They set it up so
the mode's overload

47
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,041
would cause an
internal explosion.

48
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:54,041
[FRANXX laughs]
They got me. They got me good!

49
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:57,166
If this thing blows,
the planet will go with it.

50
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:00,416
And Code Zero-One-Six
prevented that from happening?

51
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:03,125
[FRANXX]
All he's done is slow it down.

52
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,833
As things stand, it will
reach critical in...

[HACHI gasps]

54
00:03:13,625 --> 00:03:16,833
[ZERO TWO] So, that's how much
time my darling bought us, huh?

55
00:03:16,916 --> 00:03:18,791
[HACHI]
Code Zero-Zero-Two?

56
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:24,000
[MIKU] Don't you think it's
too dangerous to stay here?

57
00:03:24,083 --> 00:03:26,458
What else are we
supposed to do?

58
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,291
[ICHIGO]
Hey, calm down.

59
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,625
We should assume we won't get
any more orders from above.

60
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:33,750
Which means we'll have to
deal with this ourselves.

61
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,333
[IKUNO] They were saying
some pretty strange stuff

62
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:36,750
in that last message.

63
00:03:36,833 --> 00:03:40,625
Uh-huh. About using Star Entity
as a bomb or something.

64
00:03:40,708 --> 00:03:43,500
They also said that the
whole planet would explode.

65
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:46,125
[grunts] Yeah, nothing
they said sounded normal.

66
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,541
[ZOROME]
What does that mean?

67
00:03:47,625 --> 00:03:50,291
Wasn't that thing supposed
to put an end to the war?

68
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,666
[ICHIGO gasps]

69
00:03:54,083 --> 00:03:56,208
[ICHIGO] We should go
and see for ourselves.

70
00:03:56,291 --> 00:04:00,125
If the bomb thing is real, we
don't have time to stand around.

71
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:03,333
You're right. And I'm worried
about Hiro and Zero Two.

72
00:04:03,416 --> 00:04:05,916
[MIKU]
Yeah, good point. Okay then.

73
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,500
[ICHIGO] We're heading back...
to the Gran Crevasse!

74
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,583
[HIRO screams]

75
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:23,208
[001] It's no use. VIRM got me.
It's over. We've lost.

76
00:04:23,291 --> 00:04:26,833
These VIRM,
what exactly are they?

77
00:04:26,916 --> 00:04:29,625
Who are these guys that
came from the sky?

78
00:04:29,708 --> 00:04:31,833
The ones your people fought?

79
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,500
When I connected
with you, I felt it.

80
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,625
The passing of an
unbelievable amount of time.

81
00:04:37,708 --> 00:04:39,416
When did it begin?

82
00:04:47,541 --> 00:04:52,500
She said that I was a fake.
What was that all about?

83
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,208
What did she mean?

84
00:04:55,625 --> 00:05:00,000
[FRANXX] She is the sole
survivor of the klaxo-sapiens,

85
00:05:00,083 --> 00:05:03,666
and you... are her clone.

86
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:09,291
[001] It has been more than
60 million years now.

87
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:15,125
[001] We inhabited this planet,
as a civilization

88
00:05:15,208 --> 00:05:17,666
far more advanced than yours.

89
00:05:20,416 --> 00:05:24,458
[001]
But one day, VIRM arrived.

90
00:05:24,541 --> 00:05:27,750
They were a group mind
with no physical bodies,

91
00:05:27,833 --> 00:05:30,791
and they wanted us to join them.

92
00:05:30,875 --> 00:05:32,208
[HIRO]
Join them?

93
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:35,166
[001] They were telling us
to cast aside our bodies.

94
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,166
We refused, and war broke out.

95
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:43,250
[001]
During that centuries-long war,

96
00:05:43,333 --> 00:05:46,833
we reforged ourselves
into immortal weapons.

97
00:05:46,916 --> 00:05:51,083
And evolved into what you
people call "klaxosaurs."

98
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:53,791
By the time we finally
fought off VIRM,

99
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:56,125
fighting and warfare
was all that remained

100
00:05:56,208 --> 00:05:58,583
of our civilization.

101
00:05:58,666 --> 00:06:01,875
We had even lost our
ability to procreate.

102
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,666
[001]
But things did not end there.

103
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:11,416
The enemy we had fought off
was but VIRM's vanguard.

104
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,708
With no innate form,
they kept expanding,

105
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:18,833
adding weapons of the planets
they devour to their arsenal.

106
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:20,291
[HIRO]
No.

107
00:06:20,375 --> 00:06:23,541
[001] To prepare for
VIRM's inevitable return,

108
00:06:23,625 --> 00:06:26,000
we went underground.

109
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:31,708
The weak turned themselves into
energy, and the strong combined,

110
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,791
evolving into even
stronger weapons.

111
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,166
[FRANXX] That is how the
klaxo-sapiens built Star Entity,

112
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,333
a collective mass
of klaxosaurs.

113
00:06:45,416 --> 00:06:48,291
Only a klaxo-sapiens
can operate it.

114
00:06:48,375 --> 00:06:51,500
The klaxosaur princess has
probably lived millions of years

115
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,625
for that very purpose.

116
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:59,125
[FRANXX] Zero Two, you were
created to operate Star Entity

117
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,333
on behalf of the human race.

118
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:04,625
I created you from her DNA.

119
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,625
[001]
Even if victory was impossible,

120
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:12,208
I wanted to take down as
many of them as I could,

121
00:07:12,291 --> 00:07:14,166
but this is the end.

122
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:16,083
It's all over.

123
00:07:16,166 --> 00:07:19,833
[HIRO grunts]
Is it really the end?

124
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:21,250
[001]
Huh?

125
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:25,375
Is there really nothing
more you can do?

126
00:07:25,458 --> 00:07:26,875
[001]
That's right.

127
00:07:30,125 --> 00:07:34,625
[FRANXX] Many specimens were
born, but failed to survive.

128
00:07:34,708 --> 00:07:37,833
You were the only success.

129
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:41,125
Eventually, with the idea of
using them as either backups

130
00:07:41,208 --> 00:07:45,625
or stamens, I created
clones using your cells, too.

131
00:07:45,708 --> 00:07:47,833
But they didn't inherit
the klaxosaur blood.

this isn't your squad's post.

Leaving without permission can
be considered disobeying orders.

Return to your assignment.

you follow it no matter what.

this point! The bomb is going--

We have to analyze and

Do you guys seriously think that
you're special or something?

Ichigo! Now's our chance!

157
00:09:07,375 --> 00:09:09,625
[ICHIGO]
Oh, yeah! Hurry!

158
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,875
[KOKORO gasps]

159
00:09:12,958 --> 00:09:16,416
[MITSURU grunting]
Kokoro! Let's go.

160
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,708
[KOKORO]
Uh, right.

161
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:22,208
What is with those guys anyway?

162
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:23,125
[9'e]
Delta! To your left!

163
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,833
[9'd grunts]
What?

164
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:26,458
[gasps]

165
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,625
[9'e screams]

166
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:29,791
[9'a]
Delta! Epsilon!

167
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,625
[9'd grunts]

168
00:09:31,708 --> 00:09:33,333
[9'a]
Hang on, you two!

169
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:34,833
[9'y] We'll get rid
of them right away!

170
00:09:34,916 --> 00:09:38,625
[9'd screams]
No! I don't wanna die!

171
00:09:38,708 --> 00:09:41,458
[9'e screaming]
Help me!

172
00:09:41,541 --> 00:09:44,125
[9'd whimpers, screams]

173
00:09:47,583 --> 00:09:51,125
Screw every one of you.

174
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:54,750
Screw every one of you!

175
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:58,458
[9'a yells]

176
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:02,291
[ZERO TWO]
Okay, I'm going.

177
00:10:02,375 --> 00:10:03,625
[HACHI]
Where?

178
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:06,166
[ZERO TWO]
To bring back my darling.

179
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,041
[HACHI]
Don't push yourself.

180
00:10:08,125 --> 00:10:11,708
[ZERO TWO]
My darling is waiting for me.

181
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,750
[FRANXX]
What can you do there?

182
00:10:13,833 --> 00:10:17,500
Star Entity is probably
rigged with VIRM traps.

183
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:23,083
Even if you took it back, you'd
only end up falling into them.

184
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:24,541
[ZERO TWO]
So what?

185
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:25,541
[FRANXX]
Hm?

186
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:27,458
[ZERO TWO]
The klaxosaur princess?

187
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:29,708
VIRM? I don't care.

188
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:33,041
I don't care if I'm a fake,
or a monster, or whatever.

189
00:10:33,125 --> 00:10:35,416
My darling and I made a promise.

190
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,333
To be together forever.

191
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,541
And that we'd go get the
other if we were torn apart.

192
00:10:42,416 --> 00:10:44,250
[HACHI] But we learned
the door to the entry point

193
00:10:44,333 --> 00:10:48,083
only opens for
Code Zero-Zero-One.

194
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,583
[FRANXX]
Very well. I'll go with her.

195
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:51,833
[HACHI]
Doctor?

196
00:10:53,833 --> 00:10:54,875
[gasps]

197
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,708
[MIKU screams]

198
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,416
[ICHIGO yells]

199
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:11,458
Everyone...

200
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:13,125
[ALL] 
Zero Two!

201
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,666
[ZERO TWO]
Mm!

202
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:20,833
[FRANXX]
Zero-One-Six's connection has

203
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:24,833
delayed their plans,
if only briefly.

204
00:11:24,916 --> 00:11:28,708
He is most definitely an
unknown factor to VIRM.

205
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:33,541
The klaxosaur princess,
Zero-One-Six, and you,

206
00:11:33,625 --> 00:11:36,708
together, the three of you
could create a miracle.

207
00:11:36,791 --> 00:11:38,250
You think so?

208
00:11:38,333 --> 00:11:40,000
[FRANXX]
It's a highly optimistic view

209
00:11:40,083 --> 00:11:44,375
with no basis whatsoever.
Some might call it blind hope.

210
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:46,416
Even so,

211
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,333
it's still a lot better than
standing no chance at all.

212
00:11:51,083 --> 00:11:53,375
[MIKU]
Man, these guys don't give up!

213
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:56,708
[ZOROME]
Now there's another!

214
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,708
[ICHIGO gasps]

215
00:11:57,791 --> 00:11:59,125
[GORO]
It's caved in!

216
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,791
[MITSURU]
No! We'll have to take a detour!

217
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:03,250
[ICHIGO] There's not
enough time for that!

218
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,000
[ZERO TWO gasps]

219
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,041
[IKUNO]
Get back, everyone.

220
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:11,750
[MIKU]
What are you doing, Ikuno?

221
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:14,458
[IKUNO] Futoshi! We're going
to open up a path!

222
00:12:14,541 --> 00:12:15,583
Right!

223
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:18,666
[ICHIGO]
Wait, Ikuno! If you do that--

224
00:12:19,958 --> 00:12:22,291
[ALL grunt]

225
00:12:26,375 --> 00:12:27,541
[ICHIGO]
Are you okay?

226
00:12:27,625 --> 00:12:32,875
--[IKUNO pants]
--[FUTOSHI] Ikuno! Your hair!

227
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,291
[ZOROME]
Damn it!

228
00:12:34,375 --> 00:12:35,541
[IKUNO]
Ichigo! Move!

229
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,208
[ICHIGO]
How can I?

230
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:42,791
[KOKORO] I'll stay behind.
The rest of you, go on ahead.

231
00:12:42,875 --> 00:12:43,958
[MIKU]
The hell we will!

232
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:44,875
[KOKORO]
Huh?

233
00:12:44,958 --> 00:12:45,958
[MIKU]
We're staying with you!

234
00:12:46,041 --> 00:12:47,875
You're not gonna
throw your life away!

235
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,458
[KOKORO]
But Miku...

236
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:50,291
[MITSURU]
Kokoro.

237
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,791
[KOKORO gasps]

238
00:12:51,875 --> 00:12:54,125
I think our teammates are
making the right call on this.

239
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:55,916
We should fight together.

240
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,291
[KOKORO]
Mm.

241
00:12:57,375 --> 00:12:58,583
[ZOROME]
Either way,

242
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:00,791
we'll need manpower to
hold these things off.

243
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:04,041
[MIKU] Okay, there you have it.
So get going already!

244
00:13:04,125 --> 00:13:06,291
Ichigo.

245
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,958
[ICHIGO]
I understand.

246
00:13:08,041 --> 00:13:10,833
[IKUNO]
Zero Two. Get Hiro for us.

247
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:12,500
[FUTOSHI]
After we save the world,

248
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,875
let's have a big feast together!
We'll even make a bunch

249
00:13:15,958 --> 00:13:19,125
of your favorite sweets
things for it, too!

250
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:20,791
[ZERO TWO]
Mm.

251
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,750
[ICHIGO]
You take care of Chlorophytum!

252
00:13:22,833 --> 00:13:25,083
And don't you guys dare die!

253
00:13:25,166 --> 00:13:26,250
[GORO]
Let's go!

254
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:30,625
[ZOROME]
Welp, leader's orders.

255
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:33,458
Miku? We're gonna survive,
no matter what!

256
00:13:33,541 --> 00:13:35,000
[MIKU]
Of course we are!

257
00:13:35,083 --> 00:13:36,541
[KOKORO gasps]

258
00:13:36,625 --> 00:13:37,833
[MITSURU]
Here they come!

259
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:46,083
[HIRO breathes heavily]

260
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:53,375
[001]
Why? Why do you still struggle?

261
00:13:53,458 --> 00:13:57,333
This battle was never
yours to fight.

262
00:13:57,416 --> 00:13:59,041
I used to be the same.

263
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:00,083
[001]
Huh?

264
00:14:00,166 --> 00:14:02,416
I was the same way
as you people.

265
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,916
I never doubted for a second
that my purpose in life

266
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,333
was to fight, and I
wasn't afraid to die.

267
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:11,500
But you know what
I came to learn?

268
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,750
You don't call that living.

269
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:16,666
Meeting Zero Two
helped me understand.

270
00:14:16,750 --> 00:14:19,208
Crying, Laughing,
Falling in love.

271
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:22,583
The time we spend doing those
things is truly valuable.

272
00:14:22,666 --> 00:14:25,333
And I realized I wanted
to protect it all.

273
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,958
[001 gasps]

274
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,458
[HIRO] But if we march into
death, we'll lose everything.

275
00:14:31,541 --> 00:14:33,333
It'll all be gone.

276
00:14:33,416 --> 00:14:34,875
And I'm not having that!

277
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,500
I will never give up,
you hear me!

278
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:40,708
I promised her... that I'd
be with her forever.

279
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,250
[001 gasps]

280
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,083
I don't just live
to fight anymore.

281
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,250
I'm going to fight to live.

282
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:04,791
What the...? Is that Hringhorni?

283
00:15:04,875 --> 00:15:06,375
Who's operating it?

Hey, Papa. Say something.

Crap! It's catchin' up!

288
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,250

Go! Get Hiro for us!

292
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,291
[ICHIGO] Both of you had
better come back together.

there's going to be hell to pay!

They didn't turn me into a

[FRANXX] It's the least
I could do to atone.

I won't ask for forgiveness.
Feel free to hate me.

Are you telling me to ride you?

313
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:28,458
All right, then.

314
00:17:31,250 --> 00:17:32,375
[ZERO TWO]
Hey.

315
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,583
[FRANXX]
Hm?

316
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:36,708
[ZERO TWO] Did you take
me to Plantation 13,

317
00:17:36,791 --> 00:17:40,250
to reunite me with my darling?

318
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,541
[FRANXX]
Who knows?

319
00:17:41,625 --> 00:17:43,625
It's not like I was
expecting you two

320
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:48,125
to rekindle what you had.
It was just a scientist's whim.

321
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,958
A fancy.

322
00:17:50,041 --> 00:17:51,625
[ZERO TWO]
That's so you.

323
00:17:54,458 --> 00:17:56,291
[ZERO TWO]
I should say this before I go.

324
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:57,791
[FRANXX]
Hm?

325
00:17:57,875 --> 00:18:01,708
'Cause you created me and
helped me meet my darling.

326
00:18:01,791 --> 00:18:03,166
So, thank you.

327
00:18:06,666 --> 00:18:10,208
[FRANXX]
When did she become so... human?

328
00:18:15,625 --> 00:18:17,666
[ZERO TWO grunts]

329
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:27,541
[ZERO TWO grunts]

330
00:18:37,166 --> 00:18:38,500
Thank you.

331
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:46,083
[ZERO TWO]
Strelizia.

332
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:54,333
[ZERO TWO]
Wait for me... darling.

333
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,375
Darling!

334
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:09,250
[ZERO TWO] Darling! I'm here!
I kept my promise!

335
00:19:09,333 --> 00:19:11,458
Hey! Darling!

336
00:19:11,541 --> 00:19:15,541
Wake up! Open your eyes!
Why aren't you saying anything?

337
00:19:15,625 --> 00:19:17,291
Please, talk to me!

338
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:21,833
Hey, hey... Hey, hey, hey, hey!

339
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,916
I'm talking to you!

340
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:26,541
[ZERO TWO gasps]

341
00:19:31,125 --> 00:19:33,458
Oh, no...

342
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:37,458
[alarm buzzes]

343
00:19:40,833 --> 00:19:44,333
So then, it didn't work.

344
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:47,958
[ZERO TWO]
I will... never accept this.

345
00:19:54,708 --> 00:19:58,083
And I will never give up!

346
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:02,833
Please wait for me, darling.

347
00:20:07,833 --> 00:20:10,291
[001]
Is this what living is for you?

348
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:12,625
I'm beginning to understand.

349
00:20:12,708 --> 00:20:14,833
We believed by
abandoning our ties

350
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
and embracing solitude,

351
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:20,375
we could perfect ourselves
and become stronger.

352
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:24,041
However... perhaps some lives

353
00:20:24,125 --> 00:20:27,125
only shine in unison
with another.

354
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,458
[001]
Very well.

355
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,541
I shall give you every ounce of
strength that remains within me.

356
00:20:34,625 --> 00:20:38,166
Whether you can take over the
controls will be up to you.

357
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,833
[001]
This planet and its future...

358
00:20:44,916 --> 00:20:48,666
...I stake... on the two of you.

359
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:56,250
[ZERO TWO]
Darling. Darling?

360
00:21:01,083 --> 00:21:02,583
[HIRO]
Zero Two.

361
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:13,000
I did it. I kept my promise.

362
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:15,458
I believed you would.

363
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:18,166
Everybody helped me
get back to you.

364
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:30,166
[HIRO]
Zero Two, I missed you.

365
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:33,375
[ZERO TWO]
Same here, darling.

366
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:47,250
[BOTH chuckle]

367
00:21:57,250 --> 00:21:58,500
What is this?

368
00:22:03,208 --> 00:22:07,541
[001] Humans, we shall
take flight once more.

369
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:13,125
Decide whether you want to
fight or accept your ruin.

370
00:22:16,041 --> 00:22:18,541
[APE VICE CHIEF] Strelizia is
rejecting all attempts

371
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:19,708
at interference.

372
00:22:19,791 --> 00:22:22,666
[PAPA]
It broke free of our program?

373
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:29,083
[ZERO TWO] Right now, I feel you
closer to me than ever before.

374
00:22:29,166 --> 00:22:33,166
I know what you're thinking,
like the back of my own hand.

375
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,166
No matter what happens,
from here on out,

376
00:22:36,250 --> 00:22:39,750
our hearts will always
be as one, darling!

377
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:44,875
[HIRO shouts]

378
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:05,458
[FRANXX]
I see it! I see it!

379
00:23:05,541 --> 00:23:12,875
Ah. How beautiful you are,
my Apus, Strelizia.

380
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,375
Apus!

381
00:23:21,541 --> 00:23:23,166
[APE VICE CHIEF]
We have no choice.

382
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:27,083
We'll settle for the lance of
life built from klaxosaurs.

383
00:23:27,166 --> 00:23:30,875
We wanted more, but we'll
withdraw for now.

384
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:42,416
[PAPA]
But know that we will return.

385
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,541
And when do, we'll bring
our full army,

386
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:49,250
and erase this planet
from existence.

387
00:23:49,333 --> 00:23:50,833
[9'a]
Papa...

388
00:23:55,708 --> 00:23:58,208
[pants]

389
00:23:58,291 --> 00:24:02,458
It looks like we
did it, Zero Two.

390
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,208
Zero Two?
