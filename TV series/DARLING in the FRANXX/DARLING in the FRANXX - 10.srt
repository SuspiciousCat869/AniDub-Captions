[NANA sighs]

159
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,333
[NANA]
All right, let's go.

160
00:09:08,416 --> 00:09:09,750
[ALL gasp]

161
00:09:12,625 --> 00:09:14,458
[ZOROME gasps]

162
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:17,791
This is great. Someday I'll
live here, too, right?

163
00:09:17,875 --> 00:09:20,250
After I get to become
an adult, of course.

164
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,791
Maybe. But, y'know,
for some reason,

165
00:09:22,875 --> 00:09:24,666
I can't see us
becoming adults.

166
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,791
Same goes for me, actually.

167
00:09:26,875 --> 00:09:29,333
There's no proof that
we'll be able to, anyway.

168
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,916
[ZOROME] That's because you
guys have no imagination at all.

169
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,291
[FUTOSHI]
"Imagination"?

170
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:35,916
With Zorome, it's delusion.

171
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,000
[MIKU giggles]
You can say that again!

172
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:41,333
Zero Two, d'you remember
a while back?

173
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,583
You once called
this city "lifeless."

174
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,291
What did you mean by that?

175
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:48,666
I meant exactly that.

176
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:51,125
You okay? You've been
acting kinda weird.

177
00:09:51,208 --> 00:09:52,708
Did something happen?

178
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:57,333
I'm fine. I just couldn't care
less about this place, is all.

179
00:10:02,541 --> 00:10:05,916
[MIKU giggles] I've never seen
it from so close before!

180
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:07,666
It's beautiful.

181
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:11,333
To think, that alone powers
the entire plantation.

182
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,666
Cool, huh, Ich--

183
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,875
[ICHIGO grunts]

184
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,083
I guess I shouldn't
have done that.

185
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:20,083
Huh? What are you talking about?

186
00:10:20,166 --> 00:10:24,208
When I told you how I felt.
That was selfish of me to do.

187
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:27,125
So, please, don't let
it bother you.

188
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:30,875
[ICHIGO sighs]

189
00:10:30,958 --> 00:10:33,000
All right, kids,
we're heading back now.

190
00:10:33,083 --> 00:10:34,708
[KIDS]
Yes, ma'am!

191
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:47,583
[ZOROME]
Hup! Wha--!

192
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:48,791
[yelps]

193
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:54,416
[ZOROME]
Whoa! So cool!

194
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,083
[ZOROME gasps]

195
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:18,291
[ZOROME sighs]

196
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:19,708
[ZOROME]
What the--?

197
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:24,083
Seriously?

198
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,166
[ZOROME]
You're kidding me.

199
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,666
[ZOROME] Why isn't anybody here?
Are they all asleep?

200
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:57,500
[gasps] There's someone!

201
00:11:57,583 --> 00:11:59,750
Hello! Excuse me!

202
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,208
They just ignored me?

203
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,458
[ZOROME grunts]

204
00:12:13,541 --> 00:12:15,875
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A gasps]

205
00:12:15,958 --> 00:12:19,166
[ZOROME shouts]

206
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:28,958
Oh, good.
You've finally woken up.

207
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:32,458
[BOTH gasp]

208
00:12:32,541 --> 00:12:34,125
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
What a relief.

209
00:12:34,208 --> 00:12:37,250
You didn't wake after I
initially treated you,

210
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,291
so I was a bit worried.

211
00:12:41,166 --> 00:12:44,083
[ZOROME]
Uh. Oh. Thank you very much.

212
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:45,666
You're welcome. Of course,

213
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:48,750
your body and other things are
a little different from ours.

214
00:12:48,833 --> 00:12:51,666
The medical checker just
wouldn't work on you.

215
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:54,166
But I kept trying and
eventually I thought to test

216
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:58,500
the other settings, such as
"pet mode," and success!

217
00:12:58,583 --> 00:13:03,250
Am I... inside a
grown-up's house?

218
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:06,250
[ZOROME gasps]
Oh. Sorry about that.

219
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:10,541
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A] My. That
must have been rough for you.

220
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,291
Yup. They're heartless,
that's all there is to it.

221
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,791
Don't you worry. I'll go send
word about this right away.

222
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:20,000
[ZOROME gasps]
Wait. Hold on.

223
00:13:21,333 --> 00:13:22,041
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Hm?

224
00:13:22,125 --> 00:13:23,916
Before you make that call,

225
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:27,000
do you think maybe we
could talk for a bit?

226
00:13:27,083 --> 00:13:31,041
Y'see. I've, uh, always
looked up to adults.

227
00:13:31,125 --> 00:13:34,375
So I have a bunch of
questions and stuff.

228
00:13:36,458 --> 00:13:41,166
Very well. I don't see any harm
in it. Let's have a little chat.

229
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:42,541
[ZOROME gasps]

230
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,916
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
But first, I'll make some tea.

231
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:52,875
[ZOROME grunts]

232
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:56,625
What are you doing?

233
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:58,333
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Disinfecting.

234
00:13:58,416 --> 00:13:59,666
Oh...

235
00:14:01,875 --> 00:14:03,041
[ZOROME]
Mm?

236
00:14:03,125 --> 00:14:05,625
Go on. Help yourself.

237
00:14:08,083 --> 00:14:09,541
[gasps]

238
00:14:12,625 --> 00:14:14,458
[ZOROME coughs]

239
00:14:22,625 --> 00:14:24,541
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Did you enjoy the snack?

240
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:26,666
Heck yeah, it was super tasty!

241
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,958
Really? That's good to hear.

242
00:14:29,041 --> 00:14:31,166
[ZOROME]
Aren't you gonna eat anything?

243
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,125
No, not me.

244
00:14:33,208 --> 00:14:36,291
There was a time when I used
to enjoy the sense of taste,

245
00:14:36,375 --> 00:14:38,541
but I don't really care now.

246
00:14:38,625 --> 00:14:40,708
As long my body gets
the nutrition it needs,

247
00:14:40,791 --> 00:14:42,500
I'm quite content.

248
00:14:44,791 --> 00:14:45,916
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Huh?

249
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,750
[ZOROME gasps]
Your home. It's pretty huge.

250
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,875
So how many people
live in this place?

251
00:14:50,958 --> 00:14:52,916
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Just two. My partner and myself.

252
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,833
That's it? Only two people
in this whole apartment?

253
00:14:55,916 --> 00:14:57,083
That's correct.

254
00:14:57,166 --> 00:15:00,583
[ZOROME] Wow. And adults
have partners, too, huh?

255
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:01,791
Oh, yes.

256
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:04,666
[ZOROME]
So, does that mean...? No, wait.

257
00:15:04,750 --> 00:15:07,458
It's not because you
need to pilot a FRANXX.

258
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:10,125
So why do you have a partner?

259
00:15:10,208 --> 00:15:13,833
Because we're following
a very old custom.

260
00:15:13,916 --> 00:15:16,083
For the sake of convenience.

261
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,500
[ZOROME]
Custom?

262
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,291
A long time ago, men and
women used to pair up together

263
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:23,125
to form special
relationships, apparently.

264
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:27,500
They would do this to make
things easier and to procreate.

265
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,500
Life must've been uncomfortable.

266
00:15:29,583 --> 00:15:30,875
[ZOROME]
Why's that?

267
00:15:30,958 --> 00:15:32,000
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Well, because they had to rely

268
00:15:32,083 --> 00:15:34,375
on others for
every little thing.

269
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:36,833
Doesn't that sound
annoying to you?

270
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,375
[ZOROME]
I guess.

271
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:42,000
How would you like
to meet my partner?

272
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,916
[ZOROME]
What? Is he here?

273
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,875
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A sighs]
Come with me.

274
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:51,416
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
This man is my partner.

275
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,958
Oh.

276
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,583
That's a big smile on his face.

277
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:59,041
Whatever he's dreaming about,
it must be amazing.

278
00:15:59,125 --> 00:15:59,875
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A chuckles]

279
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:00,666
[ZOROME gasps]

280
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,125
He's not dreaming at all.

281
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:05,041
He's receiving his
dose of happiness.

282
00:16:05,125 --> 00:16:06,583
[ZOROME]
Huh?

283
00:16:06,666 --> 00:16:08,208
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A] You see,
he's activating his brain's

284
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,875
reward system to gain
a sense of pleasure.

285
00:16:10,958 --> 00:16:14,583
A truly, truly wonderful thing.

286
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:15,958
[ZOROME]
Hm.

287
00:16:18,166 --> 00:16:20,916
I'd rather get it from eating
more of those snacks you had.

288
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:22,791
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A grunts]

289
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:25,666
[ZOROME gasps]
Hey, are you okay?

290
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,083
I'm just feeling a bit tired.

291
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:30,166
Let's go back to
the living room.

292
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:32,458
[ZOROME]
Uh, sure.

293
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,166
[ZOROME]
Are you really all right?

294
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,541
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A] I'm sorry.
It's been such a long time

295
00:16:39,625 --> 00:16:43,041
since I've talked with someone
this much. I'm not used to it.

296
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:47,083
For real? But don't you and your
partner talk to each other?

297
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:52,208
We don't. Come to think of it,
I can't remember his voice.

298
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,583
[ZOROME]
You haven't spoken in that long?

299
00:16:54,666 --> 00:16:57,541
There's no need for us to speak.

300
00:16:57,625 --> 00:16:59,708
[ZOROME]
Are you guys on bad terms?

301
00:16:59,791 --> 00:17:01,291
Oh, no.

302
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:04,583
I don't think either of us is
dissatisfied with our partner.

303
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:06,875
We don't meddle in
each other's business,

304
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,375
which gives us the freedom to
live our lives as we please.

305
00:17:10,458 --> 00:17:12,583
I guess that
sorta makes sense.

306
00:17:12,666 --> 00:17:15,166
Honestly, I can't even tell
you how much I have to hear

307
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,208
my partner's voice
each and every day.

308
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:18,791
[MYSTERIOUS WOMAN A]
Oh?

309
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,750
Of all the girls in our squad, I
got partnered with the loudest,

310
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,416
naggiest one!
Talk about bad luck!

311
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,083
She gets so emotional!

312
00:17:25,166 --> 00:17:27,958

impact your missions?

Uh. Maybe. I guess. But the
truth is, it doesn't really

Well, if there isn't a problem,

Oh. I must've told you that.

Anyway! When it comes to Miku,
she has an awful personality,

And, to be honest,

she is pretty cute, when she
keeps her mouth shut.

I get this really strong
urge to protect her,

that feeling's what lets us
