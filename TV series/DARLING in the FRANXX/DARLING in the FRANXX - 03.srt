It won't matter

160
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:27,708
Look at it. This lifeless city.

161
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:30,416
There're no skies
or oceans here.

162
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,708
It's isolated at the end of
a one-way street to nowhere.

not safe! Come back!

Say, darling?

Do you wanna run away with me?

166

I can get you out of

[FUTOSHI gasps]
They want us to fight already?

171
00:10:03,791 --> 00:10:05,583
There's no need to be nervous.

172
00:10:05,666 --> 00:10:07,166
You won't be battling klaxosaurs

173
00:10:07,250 --> 00:10:09,333
like the one the
other day just yet.

174
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,000
Oh, thank goodness.

175
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,041
[NANA] We would've liked to
ease you in more gradually,

176
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:15,958
but unfortunately,
we can't afford to.

177
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:19,083
[HACHI] You'll be facing
a Conrad-class klaxosaur.

178
00:10:19,166 --> 00:10:22,500
It's just a little bit
smaller than a FRANXX.

179
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:26,958
Klaxosaurs are attracted
to magma-energy reactions.

180
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:29,875
Lately, they've been showing
up deep in a Level Eight mine

181
00:10:29,958 --> 00:10:33,416
on the outskirts, wreaking all
kinds of havoc there.

182
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:36,541
Even the automatic bulwark
systems can't keep up with them.

183
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:38,000

We should mention that Strelizia

184
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:39,833

going to have to defend

yourselves eventually.

188
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:48,958
[NANA] If you can't
eliminate this klaxosaur,

189
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:51,500
there's no way you can
handle any in the future.

190
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:54,083
So just focus on
the task at hand.

191
00:10:54,166 --> 00:10:56,791
Ichigo and Goro will have
command in the field.

192
00:10:56,875 --> 00:10:58,083

Right.

about the mock battle?

195

'Cause we're going
into actual combat now.

196

Gotta switch gears.

Yeah. I know.

I'll do my best as leader.

201
00:11:20,541 --> 00:11:22,166
You take care of the handling.

202
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,500

Sure thing. Let's do this.

Finally, my first battle!

204

Just try not to get
so full of yourself

you've got anything.

I'm almost there,
just give me a second!

216
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:06,291
Don't bother. It's over.

217
00:12:06,375 --> 00:12:09,083
[FEMALE OPERATOR A] It appears,
their para-capacity's too low,

218
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:11,250

No go, huh?

220
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,125

Chlorophytum will stay behind.

221
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:18,125
The other three will
go on without it.

223

This might be tough.

That's a big hole.

How far down do
you think it goes?

00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:31,416
[ZOROME] Do you see
that pipe? It's a monster!

227
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:35,250
[GORO] They used these to
extract the magma reserves?

00:12:35,333 --> 00:12:37,083
[HACHI]
Head down to Level Eight.

229
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,666
As you're well aware by now,

230
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,708
in order to completely
neutralize a klaxosaur,

231
00:12:41,791 --> 00:12:43,500
you must first
extract its core,

232
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,333
which is essentially its heart,

233
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:49,083
and then shatter it using your
customized magma-energy weapons.

234
00:12:49,166 --> 00:12:51,875
If the core's destroyed,
so is the klaxosaur.

235
00:12:51,958 --> 00:12:53,041
Got that?

No, nothing like that.

Pardon, but if I may, is it
possible that the two of us

simply have a
compatibility issue?

through this at first.

it isn't grounds for
splitting you two up.
