The female's soul
connected to the weapon,

and the male's soul took root
in the core, the cockpit.

They're merely an application

Klaxosaurs that can

[PAPA] I was hoping it
wouldn't come to this,

317
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,291
but we have no choice.

318
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:47,375
[MALE SAGE A]
What?

319
00:18:47,458 --> 00:18:49,541
[APE VICE CHIEF]
We had wanted to take it

320
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:53,333
and Hringhorni into
space as soldiers.

321
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,458
[MALE SAGE C]
Into... space?

322
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,166
[PAPA]
If we can't have it,

323
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,500
then it can go down
along with this planet.

324
00:18:59,583 --> 00:19:00,833
[MALE SAGE A]
What are you saying?

325
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:04,791
[PAPA] And we will return
to our "original roles."

326
00:19:07,166 --> 00:19:08,083
[FUTOSHI]
An earthquake?!

327
00:19:08,166 --> 00:19:10,833
[IKUNO gasps]
Look! Over there!

328
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,583
[GORO]
Are these...

329
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:20,000
[ICHIGO]
...some kind of klaxosaur?

330
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,250
[ICHIGO gasps]

331
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,500
[MIKU]
They can fly?!

332
00:19:26,583 --> 00:19:27,458
[MIKU yelps]

333
00:19:27,541 --> 00:19:29,125
[9'a]
Again?

334
00:19:29,208 --> 00:19:31,291
[FEMALE FRANXX PILOT A]
An even bigger one!

335
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,583
[MALE FRANXX PILOT B]
What is this?

336
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:35,708
[IKUNO]
Klaxosaurs?

337
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:39,250
There's no way. This is
far too outrageous.

338
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:04,166
[ZOROME]
What the hell is this?

339
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:06,666
[FUTOSHI gasps] It's nothing
like our previous battles!

340
00:20:06,750 --> 00:20:09,000
[ICHIGO] Just what in
the world is happening?

341
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:12,458
[ICHIGO gasps]

342
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:17,166
[HACHI] So, that's Star
Entity's awakened form?

343
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:21,916
[FRANXX]
This is it! My Strelizia Apus!

344
00:20:23,625 --> 00:20:28,708
[FRANXX laughs]
Beautiful!

345
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:31,708
I wish I could have piloted it!

346
00:20:31,791 --> 00:20:35,166
No, that doesn't matter anymore.

347
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,541
[HACHI gasps]

348
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:42,666
[001] Look at you. How ugly
the humans have made you.

349
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:46,958
But... you are still our child.

350
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:59,083
[001] A long time ago, when we
were attacked by invaders

351
00:20:59,166 --> 00:21:05,333
from the expanse of space,
we fought and drove them off.

352
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:10,500
Then, we holed up in the earth,
and prepared for their return.

353
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,583
[HIRO]
"Invaders"?

354
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,291
[001]
Indeed.

355
00:21:19,125 --> 00:21:25,000
[001] They are invaders.
Our true enemy. VIRM.

356
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:27,958
[HIRO]
True enemy? Invaders?

357
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,541
[001]
Filthy invaders.

358
00:21:41,625 --> 00:21:45,375
This time. I shall not even
let you touch our planet.

359
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,708
[PAPA, SAGES gasp]

360
00:22:01,166 --> 00:22:06,041
[001] Die. You will not...
take our planet!

361
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:08,708
[PAPA]
It's futile.

362
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,041
[001 gasps]

363
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:12,833
[ICHIGO gasps]

364
00:22:12,916 --> 00:22:14,458
What happened?

365
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,958
[001 grunts]
Curse you, VIRM!

366
00:22:20,041 --> 00:22:22,625
What did you do to our child?

367
00:22:25,291 --> 00:22:26,583
[FRANXX gasps]

368
00:22:26,666 --> 00:22:30,250
[FRANXX]
What? What's going on?

369
00:22:30,333 --> 00:22:33,125
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
This is VIRM's will.

370
00:22:33,208 --> 00:22:34,583
[MALE SAGE C]
What?

371
00:22:36,708 --> 00:22:39,750
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Star Entity is a mass of life

372
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:42,750
that could disturb
the universe's peace.

373
00:22:42,833 --> 00:22:45,875
[PAPA] As such, if the klaxosaur
princess were to take over

374
00:22:45,958 --> 00:22:50,083
the implanting process,
we programmed it to explode.

375
00:22:50,166 --> 00:22:52,291
[APE VICE CHIEF]
The die has been cast.

376
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,333
[PAPA]
This planet...

377
00:22:58,416 --> 00:23:00,208
[APE VICE CHIEF]
...will explode.

378
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,333
[PAPA, APE VICE CHIEF]
Leaving nothing behind.

379
00:23:02,416 --> 00:23:05,916
Hiro. Zero Two!

380
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,208
[FRANXX]
Stop. Please stop!

381
00:23:09,291 --> 00:23:10,708
Doctor!

382
00:23:10,791 --> 00:23:16,708
[FRANXX] It's all ruined!
Apus, my ultimate work of works!

383
00:23:16,791 --> 00:23:18,708
Don't defile it!

384
00:23:19,958 --> 00:23:24,333
[APE VICE CHIEF] We will absorb
all lifeforms on this planet.

385
00:23:24,416 --> 00:23:29,250
[PAPA] And will take you
to eternal paradise.

386
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:33,333
[001 grunts]
You impertinent fiends!

387
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:37,083
[HIRO yells]

388
00:23:37,166 --> 00:23:38,458
Damn!

389
00:23:41,583 --> 00:23:43,791
[HIRO gasps]
Zero Two!

390
00:23:49,208 --> 00:23:52,083
[ZERO TWO]
I... I promised.

391
00:23:56,083 --> 00:23:59,541
[ZERO TWO]
Darling. I'm gonna come get you.

392
00:24:02,458 --> 00:24:04,041
[ZERO TWO]
No matter what!
