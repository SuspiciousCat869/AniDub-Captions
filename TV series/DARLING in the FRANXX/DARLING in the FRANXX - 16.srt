00:09:36,125 --> 00:09:37,833
[gasps]

158
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:43,000
You're a very kind person,
and talented with your hands.

159
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:46,333
[MITSURU gasps]

160
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:50,333
[gasps] Oh, no, what have I...?

161
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm... I'm so sorry!

162
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,083
[door clatters]

163
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:59,041
[HIRO] Goro's temperature
also started rising last week.

164
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,166
It must be the Child Fever.

165
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:03,666
Since that battle,
everything's been different.

166
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:07,041
Our environment's changed,
our lifestyle.

167
00:10:07,125 --> 00:10:09,541
What are you doing?

168
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:12,541
Oh. Those are Sakura buds.

169
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:15,250
"Sakura"? What do the
flowers look like?

170
00:10:15,333 --> 00:10:18,375
When they bloom?
Uh, let me think.

171
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,500
Well. They're a
very pretty color.

172
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:24,500
The same as your hair, actually.

173
00:10:24,583 --> 00:10:28,958
[ZERO TWO chuckles]
I can't wait to see them!

174
00:10:30,916 --> 00:10:33,333
[HIRO] How do you feel
about our lives right now?

175
00:10:33,416 --> 00:10:34,916
[ZERO TWO]
I'm having fun.

176
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,166
[HIRO]
You don't think it's a pain?

177
00:10:36,250 --> 00:10:37,375
[ZERO TWO]
Not at all.

178
00:10:37,458 --> 00:10:39,916
In fact, I'd love to
live like this forever.

179
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,833
[HIRO exhales]
I feel the same way.

180
00:10:43,916 --> 00:10:49,416
I have my worries, but this
is all so new and exciting.

181
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:50,833
And...

182
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,791
[ZERO TWO gasps]
That's right!

183
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:58,166
I was supposed to go
bathing with the girls!

184
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,125
Oh, uh...

185
00:11:00,208 --> 00:11:03,000
No peeking this time, darling.

186
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,958
[MIKU]
Did you see it? Mitsuru's hair?

187
00:11:06,041 --> 00:11:07,833
[KOKORO gasps]

188
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:11,708
[MIKU chuckles] So it really
was you who cut it for him.

189
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,083
[KOKORO giggles]

190
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:15,125
I thought it looked
pretty good, myself.

191
00:11:15,208 --> 00:11:17,125
[ICHIGO]
Mm-hm.

192

--A fishie!
--Hey! Hold still!

Fine...

194
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:24,750
[MIKU] You have really
pretty hair, Zero Two.

195
00:11:24,833 --> 00:11:26,333
You think so?

196
00:11:26,416 --> 00:11:28,916
My darling told me he thought
its color was pretty earlier.

197
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,416
And he said flowers the same
shade of pink would bloom soon!

198
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,833
Do you two always talk
about corny stuff like that,

199
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:37,458
or do you mix it up sometimes?

200
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:38,500
Now you've done it!

201
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,458
[MIKU yelps]

00:11:39,541 --> 00:11:40,333
[KOKORO gasps]

203
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:41,583
Hey, watch it.

204
00:11:41,666 --> 00:11:43,291
[ZERO TWO] It's my turn
to wash your hair, Miku!

205
00:11:43,375 --> 00:11:46,125
[MIKU grunts]
I'll wash it myself thanks!

00:11:46,208 --> 00:11:47,000
[ZERO TWO gasps]

207
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,041
[MIKU gasps]

208
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:56,041
If I can't have the hair,
I guess I'll take the body!

209
00:11:56,125 --> 00:11:59,750
[MIKU]
Stop! That tickles!

210
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,000
This is what we have, guys.

211
00:12:03,083 --> 00:12:04,833
Five sources for drinking water.

212
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:06,791
And two of those sources
are only useable

213
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,833
if we have a means
of filtration.

214
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,625
There has to be some
way we can repair

215
00:12:10,708 --> 00:12:13,000
the circulation systems
by ourselves.

216
00:12:13,083 --> 00:12:15,458
Unfortunately, Mistilteinn
doesn't have the equipment

217
00:12:15,541 --> 00:12:17,041
we need to get it
up and running.

218
00:12:17,125 --> 00:12:18,750
[FUTOSHI]
And our access to the elevator

219
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:20,916
is restricted anyway, right?

220
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,875
Yeah.

221
00:12:21,958 --> 00:12:23,458
No problem!

222
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:26,500
We'll just send a letter to Papa
and ask him to fix it for us!

223
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,250
I don't think there'd be any
point writing to the adults.

224
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,500
Yeah? And what makes
you say that, huh?

225
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,291
[MIKU sighs] We never
realized how big a role

226
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,208
the caretakers
played in our lives.

227
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:40,041
No kidding. From hot
food to clean clothes,

228
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:42,208
they always provided
our necessities.

229
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:44,458
What'll happen to us if
our rations suddenly

230
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:46,750
stop being dropped off one day?

231
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,125
[ICHIGO exhales]

232
00:12:55,583 --> 00:12:58,541
Then the only option we'd have
would be to cook our own food!

233
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,708
[ALL]
Huh?

Yeah, that's right.

236
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:04,125
There's still fish
swimming in the river.

237
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:05,833
So if we could cook them...

238
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:08,916
But no one here has any
experience making food.

239
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:11,416
Because we were
never taught how to.

240
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:14,625
Actually. I think that's a
pretty good idea, as well.

241
00:13:17,541 --> 00:13:18,916
Anyway,

242
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,458
I believe I saw some books
about cooking in the study.

243
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,541
[KOKORO gasps]
In that case,

244
00:13:23,625 --> 00:13:25,916
maybe we could do
it after all, you guys!

245
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,541
[FUTOSHI]
Yeah. Maybe!

Hey, Zorome, look!

I thought you were
supposed to be dieting.

Why are you so gung-ho?

Uh, because it's cool?

[ZOROME]
Talk about a haul!

[ZERO TWO giggles]
I ended up catching 11!

Really?

00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,041
You did awesome!

00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,291
How did you do?

264
00:14:12,375 --> 00:14:14,916
Two less than what she
managed to bring in.

265
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,291
That's still amazing!

266
00:14:16,375 --> 00:14:17,166
It is.

267
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,250
And Hiro?

268
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,916
[HIRO chuckles]
I didn't catch any fish.

Don't worry. I'll teach you
all my tricks later, darling.

271
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,791
All right, next time
I'm going fishing!

Me too!

273
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:30,125
[ICHIGO sighs]

274
00:14:30,208 --> 00:14:31,583
What're you thinking about?

275
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:35,416
Oh. Not much. Just how
the mood has changed.

[MIKU, KOKORO giggle]

When the rod twitches,
you immediately reel it in!

00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:41,583
I don't know if I can!

279
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:44,375
Hiro was right this whole time.

280
00:14:44,458 --> 00:14:47,708
I had it in my head that Zero
Two was different from us.

281
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,625
That she had different reasons
and goals for fighting.

282
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,875
I painted her as an
unapproachable enigma.

283
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,875
And never even tried to see
her for who she really was.

[GORO]
Ichigo.

[ICHIGO] We'll probably
never fully understand

00:15:00,958 --> 00:15:02,875
what happened between them,

287
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,625
but right now,
she's an ordinary girl.

288
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:10,583
One of us. An irreplaceable
part of Squad 13.

00:15:10,666 --> 00:15:13,166
[GORO]
Yeah. I agree.

290
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,583
[ICHIGO] I just want
what's best for them both.

291
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:18,708
For Zero Two... and for Hiro.

292
00:15:23,666 --> 00:15:27,291
[ZOROME] We are incredible.
We cooked for ourselves!

293
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:30,000
Pretty sure you were slacking
off while we were working.

294
00:15:30,083 --> 00:15:31,125
[FUTOSHI chuckles]

295
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,000
You never know what
you're capable of.

296
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:33,875
[HIRO]
Yeah.

297
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,083
[ZERO TWO giggles]

298
00:15:35,166 --> 00:15:37,208
The question is
how will it taste?

299
00:15:37,291 --> 00:15:38,666
We followed the
book's instructions,

300
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,166
so it should be fine.

301
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:42,000
Take your seats and
join me in prayer.

302
00:15:42,083 --> 00:15:43,166
[ZOROME]
Forget about it.

303
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,416
Huh? Wait, what?

304
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:46,583
Why should we have
to pray to Papa?

305
00:15:46,666 --> 00:15:48,791
We did all of the
work ourselves!

306
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:52,416
This is actually good!

307
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,708
Really?

308
00:15:56,666 --> 00:15:58,333
Yeah, it's totally edible!

309
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:00,583
That's great!

00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,291
[ZERO TWO giggles]

311
00:16:03,375 --> 00:16:04,583
This is good.

312
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:05,958
Uh-huh.

313
00:16:10,083 --> 00:16:12,666
Is it just me or did we
do something awesome?

314
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:14,916
I mean, there's no way
any of the other squads
