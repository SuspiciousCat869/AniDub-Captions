00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,666
I mean,

162
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,625
I get so jealous of the boys
who get to stand beside you,

163
00:09:24,708 --> 00:09:27,291
because they're
boys and I'm not.

I wanna keep you all to myself.

That's so selfish.
It's a pain, right?

Why am I like this? Why am I?

[IKUNO sobs]
I hate being like this!

[ICHIGO] There's nothing
wrong with being a pain.

172
00:09:56,000 --> 00:10:00,208
In fact, I'm a pretty
big one myself.

We all are.
Complicated difficult pains.

174
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,958
But, y'know, I've started
thinking that it's actually

175
00:10:06,041 --> 00:10:08,958
all right for us to be this way.

176
00:10:09,041 --> 00:10:11,666
I get the feeling that
going through this stuff

177
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,916
and having these
experiences is what life is

supposed to be all about.

You know, I prob'ly won't be
able to give up very easily.

All those years ago,

that we'd get married
one day as well.
