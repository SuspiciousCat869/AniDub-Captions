00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:43,083
You were always good
at swimming. So good.

157
00:08:43,166 --> 00:08:44,791
[ICHIGO]
Oh, that's what you meant.

158
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:49,000
Well... I dunno,
I haven't decided.

159
00:08:49,083 --> 00:08:51,083
[IKUNO] I brought a book,
so don't worry about me.

160
00:08:51,166 --> 00:08:52,833
Go on, have fun.

161
00:08:54,458 --> 00:08:56,250
Thank you, Ikuno, I will.

162
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:05,750
[MITSURU] You came all
this way just to read?

163
00:09:05,833 --> 00:09:08,750
Should I force myself
to frolic? I'll pass.

164
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:10,416
Hey, no arguments from me.

165
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,291
[BOYS chattering]

166
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:14,041
[MITSURU]
Isn't it great?

167
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:18,208
Not too long ago, the kid
looked like he wanted to die,

168
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:20,250
and now he's a part
of the group again.

169
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,083
Funny how fast things change.

170
00:09:22,166 --> 00:09:24,458
Please don't come looking
to me for affirmation.

171
00:09:24,541 --> 00:09:26,458
I'm not like you, Mitsuru.

172
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:29,166
Oh, sorry. I was just
thinking out loud.

173
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:32,375
If that's all you wanted
to say, then are we done here?

174
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:36,666
[MITSURU] Nah. I found something
that's pretty interesting.

175
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:40,000
[HIRO grunts]
What's gotten into you guys?

176
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:42,750
[GORO] I didn't wanna intrude
on you but, you know,

177
00:09:42,833 --> 00:09:45,166
these two wouldn't listen to me.

178
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:48,291
Uh. What is it you want?

179
00:09:48,375 --> 00:09:49,750
What the heck is a kiss?

180
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:52,083
Huh? You were listening to us?

181
00:09:52,166 --> 00:09:53,416
A "kiss."

182
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:55,333
We've never heard that
word used that way before,

183
00:09:55,416 --> 00:09:58,666
but it sounds so magical!

184
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,500
[ZOROME] Where're you goin',
Hiro my boy?

185
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:02,708
It's startin' to look like
you're hiding something.

186
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:04,666
[FUTOSHI] What were you
guys getting up to?

187
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:08,291
Huh? We weren't doing
anything. Goro. Help.

188
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:13,083
[GORO] Hiro, I also wanna
know what a kiss is.

189
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:15,500
[HIRO]
Not you, too!

190
00:10:15,583 --> 00:10:18,333
I don't fully
understand it myself...

191
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:21,208
But it seems to be when
two people stick...

192
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,333
..their mouths together.

193
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,458
[ZOROME, GORO, FUTOSHI]
Their mouths?!

194
00:10:23,541 --> 00:10:25,000
Hold on a second!

195
00:10:25,083 --> 00:10:26,833
You mean mouths can be used
for something besides eating?

196
00:10:26,916 --> 00:10:28,583
Did you forget about
breathing and talking?

197
00:10:28,666 --> 00:10:32,708
And what exactly happens when
you do kiss or whatever?

198
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:37,083
Well. I guess it felt
really warm and soft.

199
00:10:37,166 --> 00:10:41,333
And it, uh...
made my heart race.

200
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,208
But, we didn't kiss
back there, all right?!

201
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:45,458
Wow, I wanna try it for myself.

202
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:48,708
[ZOROME shouts] I need to
know what it feels like!

203
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:51,458
Damn it, Hiro! You got
the jump on us yet again!

204
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:53,958
[ZOROME grunts]
You hafta let me kiss you!

205
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:55,416
[HIRO]
Huh?!

206
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,125
Wait! You should only do it
with the person you love!

207
00:10:57,208 --> 00:10:59,166
[ZOROME]
The heck is a "person you love"?

208
00:10:59,250 --> 00:11:00,666
What are you guys doing?

209
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,500
Don't try to stop me.

210
00:11:02,583 --> 00:11:04,833
[BOTH yelp]

211
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:06,000
[ZOROME]
Ow!

212
00:11:06,083 --> 00:11:08,166
Hey, do you know
what a kiss is, Ichigo?

213
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:09,750
[ICHIGO]
Huh?

214
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,291
[FUTOSHI] The thing where two
people touch mouths together.

215
00:11:12,375 --> 00:11:15,208
[ICHIGO gasps]
Nope!

216
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:16,666
[MIKU]
Hey!

217
00:11:18,833 --> 00:11:20,875
There's something
you've gotta see!

218
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,416
[ZOROME]
Huh...?

219
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,791
Hey, are you sure about this?

220
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,375
[MITSURU]
Yeah.

221
00:11:36,458 --> 00:11:38,333
You'll be able to see it when
we get to the end of this path.

222
00:11:38,416 --> 00:11:41,375
It's like some kind
of exploration! Ha! Too cool!

223
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:43,625
Maybe. But it's so dark in here,

224
00:11:43,708 --> 00:11:45,500
I'm getting a
little creeped out.

225
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,500
You do know you didn't
have to come along

226
00:11:47,583 --> 00:11:48,625
if you didn't want to.

227
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,041
[KOKORO]
Hm?

228
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:53,250
Don't talk to Kokoro like that!
She doesn't deserve it!

229
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:54,583
You don't get it.

230
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:57,458
I can't guarantee anyone's
safety from here on out.

231
00:12:02,416 --> 00:12:05,500
[GORO] Is there a relationship
closer than being partners?

232
00:12:05,583 --> 00:12:06,875
[HIRO]
Huh?

233
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,375
[GORO] Oh. Sorry, watching you
two makes me wonder.

234
00:12:09,458 --> 00:12:10,708
You talk about things like,

235
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:13,166
"kisses" and
"the person you love."

236
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:16,083
What's that all about?
I don't get it at all.

237
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:19,458
Honestly, I don't really
understand, either.

238
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,041
"Made your heart race," huh?

239
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:23,833
You know, I have a lot
of fun being with Ichigo,

240
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:26,500
but sometimes it
hurts a bit, too.

241
00:12:26,583 --> 00:12:29,250
I dunno, maybe I'm
not like you guys.

242
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:34,541
[IKUNO]
Ichigo?

243
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,875
[ICHIGO]
Huh?

244
00:12:35,958 --> 00:12:38,291
[IKUNO] What's the matter?
Your face is all red.

245
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,916
Oh, is it really?

246
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,625
[MITSURU]
We can see it now.

247
00:13:01,791 --> 00:13:03,791
What is this place?

248
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:13,625
[IKUNO] It's like a small
city or something.

249
00:13:13,708 --> 00:13:15,750
[ZOROME]
A city? This?

250
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:19,083
It's nothing like the cities
that the adults live in!

251
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,708
[KOKORO] Do you think there
are people living here?

252
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:23,250
[MITSURU]
Who knows?

253
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,791
Though I've certainly never
heard of anybody living outside

254
00:13:25,875 --> 00:13:28,000
of the plantations before.

255
00:13:35,125 --> 00:13:38,291
[ZOROME]
Hey! Is there anybody here?

256
00:13:45,166 --> 00:13:47,916
Gotta tell ya, this really
isn't what I was expecting.

257
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,541
Oh, yeah? And what exactly
were you expecting?

258
00:13:50,625 --> 00:13:51,750
[ZOROME]
Look at it!

259
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,625
This place isn't all
that different from our

260
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:56,625
boarding house, don't ya think?

261
00:13:56,708 --> 00:13:57,916
You're right.

262
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,541
It's like this was
the model they used

263
00:14:00,625 --> 00:14:02,958
to build the environment
we live in.

264
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,500
[MIKU]
Okay, but why?

265
00:14:04,583 --> 00:14:05,500
[IKUNO]
Beats me.

266
00:14:05,583 --> 00:14:09,250
[FUTOSHI]
Hm. Hey, where's Kokoro?

267
00:14:12,291 --> 00:14:15,125
[creaking footsteps]

268
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,166
[KOKORO]
Huh?

269
00:14:31,666 --> 00:14:33,208
A baby?

270
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:34,041
[MITSURU]
Kokoro!

271
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:35,625
[KOKORO]
Huh? Ah!

272
00:14:39,541 --> 00:14:42,500
Please don't wander off
on your own like that.

273
00:14:42,583 --> 00:14:46,541
It's like I told you earlier.
I can't guarantee your safety.

274
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:49,583
Oh... I'm sorry.

275
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:04,250
A kiss. Putting lips together.

276
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,500
That's right. I've done
it with my darling.

277
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,375
[ICHIGO gasps]
Zero Two.

278
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,208
What is it you've
done with Hiro?

279
00:15:17,291 --> 00:15:18,000
[ZERO TWO]
Kissed.

280
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:19,583
[ICHIGO gasps]

281
00:15:19,666 --> 00:15:22,166
[ZERO TWO giggles] I guess you
guys aren't ready for it yet.

282
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,250
[ICHIGO grunts]

283
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,833
[ICHIGO] Shows what you know.
I've done it, too.

284
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:29,958
Yeah? With whom?

285
00:15:30,041 --> 00:15:33,833
A real kiss, is shared
with your special someone.

286
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,833
So, tell me. Is the person
you kissed special to you?

287
00:15:36,916 --> 00:15:38,666
Uh, well, that's...

288
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:40,416
[GORO]
Ichigo?

289
00:15:48,166 --> 00:15:50,000
[HIRO gasps]

290
00:15:52,166 --> 00:15:55,541
[MIKU sighs]
Oh, man, I am totally beat!

291
00:15:55,625 --> 00:15:57,291
[KOKORO]
We did do a lot of walking.

292
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,208
[MIKU] I'm gonna be
so sore tomorrow.

293
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,583
[KOKORO giggles]

294
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,208
I wonder. What was
this place, anyway?

295
00:16:03,291 --> 00:16:04,750
Well, if nothing else,

296
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:07,583
we can be sure it was part of
civilization at some point.

297
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:10,916
[GORO] So, people lived
here in the past?

298
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,666
[ZERO TWO]
They abandoned it.

299
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:14,958
[HIRO]
Huh?

300
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:16,750
Humans used to live
on the surface,

301
00:16:16,833 --> 00:16:20,041
until they abandoned it.

302
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:24,166
There are tons of places like
this, all around the world.

303
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:32,541
[ZOROME]
Woohoo! The food's ready!

304
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:36,625
[ZOROME, FUTOHI chatter]

305
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:40,166
Interesting. When did all
of this stuff get here?

306
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,250
[FUTOSHI]
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

307
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:44,708
Come on, you gotta
be more careful.

308
00:16:44,791 --> 00:16:45,708
[ICHIGO]
You okay?

309
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:47,083
[FUTOSHI chuckles]
Yeah, I'm fine.

310
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:49,416
[GORO]
Here. You should have some.

311
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:54,916
[ZOROME sighs]

312
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,875
[ZOROME]
Whoa. It's starting to bubble!

313
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:58,875
Cool! Let me give it a try!

314
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,291
[ZERO TWO]
Hey, darling.

315
00:17:00,375 --> 00:17:02,333
I'm gonna go swim
some more, okay?

316
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,083
You wanna swim when
it's this dark?

317
00:17:04,166 --> 00:17:05,500
Uh-huh.

318
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:12,166
[MIKU] I'm stuffed!
My belly's gonna explode!

319
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:14,208
[KOKORO] Goodness, Miku.
Everyone's looking.

320
00:17:14,291 --> 00:17:15,791
Where are your manners?

321
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:18,791
[MIKU] After how much walking I
did today, I couldn't care less.

322
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:20,583
They can stare all they want.

323
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,750
Fact is, I've got the lap
and they're jealous!

324
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,916
[FUTOSHI, ZOROME growl]

325
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:27,833
[ZOROME] Hey, we walked
just as much as you did!

326
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:28,833
[FUTOSHI]
This isn't fair!

327
00:17:28,916 --> 00:17:30,625
[MIKU]
Yeah, yeah, keep whining.

328
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,416
[ZOROME]
Aw!

329
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:33,666
[HIRO]
Why do you think humanity

330
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:35,166
abandoned the surface?

331
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:37,750
You talkin' about what
Zero Two said earlier?

332
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:39,375
Who could really say?

333
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,583
There must be some reason they
couldn't live here anymore.

334
00:17:42,666 --> 00:17:45,791
[HIRO] But there's so much more
space and beautiful scenery.

335
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,625
I'm shocked to learn there's
a world like this outside.

336
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,208
[FUTOSHI] We have all that stuff
in Mistilteinn, too, though.

337
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:55,041
And besides, the outside world
is filled with klaxosaurs.

338
00:17:55,125 --> 00:17:59,083
But what if humanity had never
started extracting magma energy.

339
00:17:59,166 --> 00:18:01,666
Do you think the klaxosaurs
would still have shown up?

340
00:18:01,750 --> 00:18:03,833
[MITSURU] You're doubting
Papa and the rest?

341
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,791
The threat of the klaxosaurs
is why they moved into

342
00:18:06,875 --> 00:18:09,208
the plantations in
the first place.

343
00:18:09,291 --> 00:18:11,208
Is that not a noble cause?

344
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:19,291
[ZOROME shouts]
Papa and the others are amazing!

345
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:21,250
I mean, to think,
the adults used to live

346
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:22,791
in these drab outdoors,

347
00:18:22,875 --> 00:18:25,833
but now, they get to live
in bright, sparkling cities!

348
00:18:25,916 --> 00:18:27,333
[FUTOSHI]
Yeah, you're right.

349
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,666
[ZOROME] And we're the ones
protecting their lifestyles!

350
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,458
We're useful to them. Is there
anything better than that?

351
00:18:32,541 --> 00:18:34,750
As long as we keep
killing the klaxosaurs,

352
00:18:34,833 --> 00:18:36,541
we'll have plenty of
food on our table,

353
00:18:36,625 --> 00:18:38,583
and Papa will pay
attention to us!

354
00:18:38,666 --> 00:18:41,416
And then, one day, we'll surely
become adults, too!

355
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,958
Heck yeah!

356
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:46,541
[ZOROME] Well? You agree
with me, don't'cha?

357
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,541
Oh. Uh...

358
00:18:48,625 --> 00:18:53,541
C'mon, man. Why're you so down?
You can talk to your teammates.

359
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:55,000
Teammates?

360
00:18:55,083 --> 00:18:59,000
What? Did I say something
weird and not realize it?

361
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:04,250
Zorome aside, I've gotta say.

362
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:05,708
Seeing as you guys
are the newbies,

363
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,208
you'd better earn your keep,

364
00:19:07,291 --> 00:19:09,833
but you specifically have to
make up for Naomi's absence.

365
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:12,208
As for myself, I find
it very reassuring

366
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:14,083
that the both of
you are with us.

367
00:19:14,166 --> 00:19:17,583
Same goes for me. Zero Two's
already helped us out a bunch.

368
00:19:17,666 --> 00:19:19,583
Well, you heard 'em.

369
00:19:20,875 --> 00:19:22,250
[ICHIGO]
Hiro.

370
00:19:22,333 --> 00:19:24,708
Please allow me to officially
welcome you and Zero Two

371
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:28,166
as members of Squad 13.
It's good to have you.

372
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:31,333
But fair warning, as leader, I'm
going to work you to the bone.

373
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:32,416
So be prepared.

374
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,041
[ZOROME chuckles]

375
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,333
Thanks, guys.

376
00:19:35,416 --> 00:19:37,625
It means a lot,
and I'll do my best.

377
00:19:37,708 --> 00:19:39,666
You better! Welcome aboard!

378
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:41,958
Glad to finally
make it official!

379
00:19:44,833 --> 00:19:46,541
[ZERO TWO sighs]

380
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,666
[ZOROME]
Hey, guys, look! It's a crab!

381
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:52,625
[FUTOSHI]
What? Where? Is it edible?

382
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:54,916
[MITSURU] How are you still
hungry after all that food?

383
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,416
There's one over there, too!

384
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,708
Hold it right there, crab!

385
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,000
[rustling]

00:20:08,083 --> 00:20:09,333
[ICHIGO gasps]

387
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:15,041
Sorry. I hope
I didn't wake you up.

388
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:19,541
[ICHIGO] I couldn't
sleep for some reason.

389
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,791
[HIRO]
Yeah, same.

390
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:23,583
I felt like it'd be a
waste to fall asleep.

391
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:35,000
Ooh, look up, Hiro!
You can see so many stars!

392
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:38,875
[HIRO]
Wow, you're right.

393
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:40,750
Hey, there's Orion.

394
00:20:42,083 --> 00:20:45,208
[HIRO] In the past, Orion was
considered the most prominent

395
00:20:45,291 --> 00:20:46,708
winter constellation.

396
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:50,291
Really? Back when
we were little,

397
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:52,875
you'd tell me about
the stars all the time.

398
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:54,000
[HIRO]
Did I?

399
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,416
Yeah, you did!

400
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,083
I might be stupid, but I still
remember everything you

401
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,958
taught me growing up, Hiro.

402
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:01,125
Hmph.

403
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,916
So, did you forget
about that star, too?

404
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,791
[HIRO]
You mean the Ichigo star?

405
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,041
[ICHIGO]
Huh?

406
00:21:10,125 --> 00:21:12,750
The 15th of Orion,
same as your code number.

407
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:16,041
I read in a book once that it's
so dim, it can be difficult to

408
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,208
spot with the naked eye, which
is why we can't see it now.

409
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:21,791
But we promised we'd see
it together one day,

410
00:21:21,875 --> 00:21:24,458
after leaving the Garden.

411
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,833
What the heck? So you
do remember just fine.

412
00:21:26,916 --> 00:21:28,083
[HIRO grunts]

413
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,750
[ICHIGO] We can look for
the star again sometime.

414
00:21:33,833 --> 00:21:37,208
I mean, we are gonna be fighting
on the same team from now on.

415
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,708
[HIRO]
That's true.

416
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:41,291
I know that earlier I acted
all bossy and told you

417
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:44,875
to be prepared. But the rest
of us are gonna have to step up

418
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,833
and do our best, too.

419
00:21:47,916 --> 00:21:51,833
You know. I'm going to
try my hardest as leader,

420
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:54,625
so don't give all your
attention to Zero Two.

421
00:21:54,708 --> 00:21:57,083
Look at me from
time to time, as well.

422
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:03,916
[ICHIGO] Also... About our
kiss during the mock battle.

423
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,875
I see it as something special!

424
00:22:05,958 --> 00:22:08,041
And, I... wanna be with you--

425
00:22:08,125 --> 00:22:10,375
Ichigo, look! Shooting stars!

[HIRO chuckles]

428
00:22:15,541 --> 00:22:17,791
[ICHIGO] With their long tails,
the shooting stars

429
00:22:17,875 --> 00:22:20,083
blazed a trail across the sky.

430
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:25,166
Drawn in by gravity, those stars
were shining so brightly,

431
00:22:25,250 --> 00:22:28,041
just like us. And the
light they gave off

432
00:22:28,125 --> 00:22:30,666
looked to me like
gentle rays of hope.

433
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,291
[HIRO] They say if you make
a wish on a shooting star,

434
00:22:34,375 --> 00:22:35,666
it'll come true.

435
00:22:35,750 --> 00:22:37,333
So, what would you wish for?

436
00:22:37,416 --> 00:22:40,583
[ICHIGO grunts] I was
trying to tell you before.

437
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,375
[HIRO]
Uh?

438
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:45,166

Stupid Hiro.

[HIRO]
H-Hey, what the heck?

440
00:22:47,208 --> 00:22:48,625
[ICHIGO]
That night,

441
00:22:48,708 --> 00:22:52,041
I wished on the shooting stars
for that light to never...

442
00:22:52,125 --> 00:22:53,708
...ever fade.
