Ah... You probably don't know,

159
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:58,000
but I begged Nana to let me
take care of this greenhouse.

160
00:08:58,083 --> 00:09:01,250
We had some seeds, so I've
been planting and growing them

161
00:09:01,333 --> 00:09:04,375
while studying up on things.

162
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:06,708
Have you heard of the
language of flowers?

163
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,458
This is a hibiscus.

164
00:09:08,541 --> 00:09:11,875
In floral terms that means
"delicate beauty."

165
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:15,625
And over there's the cattleya
orchid which means "alluring."

[KOKORO] Um. I'm not bothering
you by chatting like this, am I?

00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:26,333
You mean because of
the fight? It's stupid.

I can't be bothered

Really? That's so cool.

Why's it cool?

00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,458
When you're expected
to toe the line,

172
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:37,208
it takes a lot of
courage to refuse.

was too afraid to.

[MIKU] Look, you made
your point, alright?

That's why I'm trying so hard
to find us things to eat.

184

[MIKU] So, this is what

down here before.

Because nobody's using it?

think this fight will go on?

it to last forever.

No, Zero Two's a normal girl.

And it's not just her.
Their job as pistils

309
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,541
means they rely on us

But then, when we
go into battle,

it's their frail bodies
taking the brunt of it.

it made me think.

There are some things
we can't do by ourselves.
