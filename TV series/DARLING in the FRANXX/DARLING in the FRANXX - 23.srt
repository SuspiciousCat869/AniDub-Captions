If we don't push
ourselves now...

[MIKU]
...then when will we?

160
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:14,250
Haaa!

161
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:19,458
[MIKU, ZOROME]
Get going! Hiro!

162
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:26,833
[HIRO]
We caught up!

163
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:31,708
[9'a] Look there.
It's the entrance.

164
00:10:31,791 --> 00:10:33,500
Nice!

165
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,625
What?

166
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:44,208
[HIRO]
Why, you!

[HIRO grunts]

[HIRO grunts]

170
00:10:58,083 --> 00:11:00,375
[9'a]
Well, this is not good.

171
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,291
It looks like this is
as far as I go with you.

172
00:11:06,375 --> 00:11:07,625
[HIRO]
What?

[HIRO grunts, gasps]

174
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,500
[9'a]
Meeting you guys

175
00:11:16,583 --> 00:11:19,958
helped me learn a little
about being human.

176
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:24,041
But my home is the battlefield,
and nowhere else.

177
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:26,541
Tell Iota "hi" for me.

178
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:29,041
[HIRO]
Alpha!

179
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,333
[9'a]
It's been kinda fun, I guess.

180
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:50,833
[HIRO] Zero Two, why did you
leave me and run off alone?

181
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:55,500
[HIRO]
Together, we are one.

182
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:58,291
"We'll always be together."

183
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:00,916
Didn't we promise
each other that?

184
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:06,333
[HIRO]
Answer me. Zero Two!

No! You can't!

187
00:12:12,958 --> 00:12:14,625
What's the matter?

188
00:12:15,750 --> 00:12:17,583
[KOKORO]
Zero Two!

189
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,625
What is... happening to you?

190
00:12:31,416 --> 00:12:32,333
No, don't!

[gasps]

193
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:49,833
Zero Two. This thing, is it you?

194
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,000
[HIRO]
If it is...

195
00:12:56,833 --> 00:13:02,000
If it's you,
then please, consume me.

196
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:15,500
[HIRO] Is this the picture
book in Zero Two's mind?

197
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,916
[ZERO TWO]
Stay away.

198
00:13:21,375 --> 00:13:22,875
[ZERO TWO]
Why'd you come?

199
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:24,708
[HIRO]
To see you.

200
00:13:27,291 --> 00:13:28,958
[HIRO]
Why did you leave?

201
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:34,125
[ZERO TWO] Because, darling,
I want you to remain human.

202
00:13:34,208 --> 00:13:36,625
[HIRO]
I want to be with you!

203
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:41,291
[ZERO TWO]
I can't be with you.

204
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:42,583
[HIRO]
Why?

205
00:13:42,666 --> 00:13:44,791
[ZERO TWO]
I just can't.

206

Hey, look!

[GORO]
Oh, crap!

211
00:14:08,458 --> 00:14:11,208
[ICHIGO] C'mon, guys,
we're gonna provide back up!

212
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:15,583
[IKUNO] Not letting us go
without a fight, huh?

213
00:14:15,666 --> 00:14:17,833
[9'y]
We'll distract them for you!

214
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:19,125
[9'b]
Go!

215
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:22,708
[ZOROME]
Thanks!

216
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:25,833
So then, should we
go in a blaze of glory?

217
00:14:25,916 --> 00:14:28,166
[9'b]
Not a bad idea.

218
00:14:35,791 --> 00:14:37,958
[NANA]
Let's move to another ship!

[NANA gasps]

00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,125
[HACHI]
So, this is it, huh?

222
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,875
Leave me and go.

223
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,791
You don't get to say that
after keeping me alive.

224
00:14:51,875 --> 00:14:53,541
To hell with that!

225
00:14:53,625 --> 00:14:54,833
You listen to me.

226
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:58,291
It's your duty to watch
over their futures, too!

[footsteps]

228
00:15:13,666 --> 00:15:15,583
[HACHI]
What's that?

229
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:19,000
[NANA] The ship was
equipped with a bomb?

230
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:21,208
--[PAPA] Cease your resistance.
--[NANA gasps]

231
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:23,000
We know that voice.

232
00:15:23,083 --> 00:15:26,166
[APE VICE CHIEF] Is there any
point at all to this warfare?

233
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:31,500
[PAPA] Eventually, all
lifeforms will merge with us.

234
00:15:31,583 --> 00:15:33,333
[APE VICE CHIEF] Surrender
yourself to the gentle,

235
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:35,791
perpetual pleasure we offer.

236
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:38,458
[PAPA]
Our utopia is free of all hatred

237
00:15:38,541 --> 00:15:40,916
and discrimination
between species.

238
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,750
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Klaxosaurs? Humanity?

239
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:45,666
Such distinctions
won't matter anymore.

240
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,375
Equality for all!

241
00:15:47,458 --> 00:15:48,833
[PAPA]
But beyond that,

242
00:15:48,916 --> 00:15:52,250
we will attain an endless
and peaceful slumber.

243
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:57,833
And at the same time, endless
and relentless evolution.

244
00:15:57,916 --> 00:15:59,791
[APE VICE CHIEF]
Rejecting that to march toward

245
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:04,083
your destruction
is far too foolish.

246

[PAPA]
Now, become one with us.

247
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:08,916
[HACHI]
To the adults,

248
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,833
that very well may have
sounded like utopia.

249
00:16:12,916 --> 00:16:15,833
But that is not where
the children belong.

250
00:16:15,916 --> 00:16:19,208
In perpetual tranquility,
the flames of their lives

251
00:16:19,291 --> 00:16:21,666
will never burn as bright.

252
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:24,666
[HACHI] It isn't a matter
of right or wrong.

253
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:28,166
This is simply the path
that the children,

254
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:31,041
and humanity, have chosen.

255
00:16:33,541 --> 00:16:35,208
[MIKU]
Things are getting pretty rough!

256
00:16:35,291 --> 00:16:36,833
How much longer does Hiro need?

257
00:16:36,916 --> 00:16:38,375
Don't worry.

He's always pulled
through in the past.

259
00:16:40,541 --> 00:16:42,708
[ICHIGO] And we're not
the only ones struggling.

260
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:46,125
Yeah. Those two must be fighting
back on Earth just as hard!

That's right!

Zero Two wants to
stay right here!

265
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,625
Yeah, but... it's bad
for your body!

Now that I'm not a parasite
anymore, I have nothing left.

00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,208
Nothing I can do!

270
00:17:10,291 --> 00:17:13,500
So I want to at least
be by her side!

271
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:17,041
Please, just let me stay.

272
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,000
All right, then I will as well.

273
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:20,583
I'll stay with you both!

274
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:22,125
Go away!

00:17:22,208 --> 00:17:24,375
I've told you so many times
you don't need to feel respons--

276
00:17:24,458 --> 00:17:26,625
[MITSURU]
It's not about responsibility!

277
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:30,458
Please don't say that
you have nothing.

278

If you don't, then neither do I!

[gasps]

280
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,833
[MITSURU]
But that's not true.

281
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,208
I've found my reason to live.

282
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:40,458
In you.

283
00:17:40,541 --> 00:17:43,541
I want to protect you
and that baby's future.

284
00:17:43,625 --> 00:17:45,375
I'm a weakling

00:17:45,458 --> 00:17:47,708
and I don't really
understand what love is.

286
00:17:47,791 --> 00:17:49,583
I don't.

287
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:54,125
But still, if I'm with you,
then I can keep walking.

That's what I've
come to believe.

But why?

Why do you say my name
even though it hurts you?

Even without our memories,
we can start over again.

294

I'll call your name as
many times as you want.

00:19:28,666 --> 00:19:30,750
What's going on?

317
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:50,708
[HIRO] I hereby vow
to never let you go.

318
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,916
[ZERO TWO]
Okay.

319
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:18,125
[GROUP]
Zero Two!

320
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:53,500
[ICHIGO]
He got to see her!

321
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:57,791
[GORO]
Wait, what?

322
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,708
Isn't that...?

323
00:21:14,791 --> 00:21:16,708
[MIKU]
What the heck is that?

324
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:17,875
[ZERO TWO]
A warp gate.

325
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,750
[MIKU, ICHIGO gasp]

326
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,250
[IKUNO]
"Warp gate"?

327
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:22,083
Yeah.

328
00:21:22,166 --> 00:21:25,291
The klaxo-sapiens built it.

329
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,250
[HIRO]
Hey, guys? Listen.

330
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:31,416
Zero Two and I are going
to go through that gate

331
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,416
and leave the solar system.

332
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,041
[IKUNO]
"Leave the solar system"?

333
00:21:35,125 --> 00:21:37,166
Wait, what? Right now?

334
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,125
[ICHIGO gasps]

335
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:39,250
No way.

336
00:21:39,333 --> 00:21:40,708
Whoa, whoa, wait a second!

337
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,541
You met up with Zero Two
like you wanted.

338
00:21:42,625 --> 00:21:44,416
Why not head back to Earth?

339
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,333
[HIRO] Apus and the gate's
system are linked.

340
00:21:47,416 --> 00:21:51,625
That means... neither of us
can stop the process.

341
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:55,208
Besides, the gate
will close soon.

342
00:21:56,625 --> 00:21:57,875
[MIKU]
You're kidding.

343
00:21:57,958 --> 00:21:59,791
[ZOROME]
This can't be happening.

344
00:21:59,875 --> 00:22:01,625
[ICHIGO]
I don't get why.

345
00:22:01,708 --> 00:22:04,916
Why do you two have to
go through that thing?

346
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:08,208
So we can finally put
an end to this war.

347
00:22:12,541 --> 00:22:16,750
Now, I see. This is
what that bomb is for.

348
00:22:19,083 --> 00:22:21,625
--[ICHIGO] Then let's all go!
--[HIRO] You can't.

349
00:22:21,708 --> 00:22:25,083
[HIRO] Only Apus can withstand
going through the gate.

350
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:27,958
[FUTOSHI] But what are you
gonna do all by yourselves?

351
00:22:28,041 --> 00:22:29,666
[IKUNO] And won't the
enemy's main force

352
00:22:29,750 --> 00:22:32,083
be much larger
than this one was?

353
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:33,166
Yeah.

354
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:35,833
We'll need to take
them by surprise.

355
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:37,958
[GORO]
You will come back, right?

356
00:22:40,666 --> 00:22:42,125
[MIKU]
Oh, no.

357
00:22:42,208 --> 00:22:43,291
[ICHIGO]
I won't let you!

358
00:22:43,375 --> 00:22:45,625
If that's your answer,
you can't go!

359
00:22:45,708 --> 00:22:47,541
Leader's orders!

360
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:49,416
Come back alive, both of you!

361
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:51,041
Ichigo.

362
00:22:51,125 --> 00:22:53,416
Exactly! I won't stand for it.

363
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:55,041
Come back to us, Hiro!

364
00:22:55,125 --> 00:22:57,625
Yeah, I'm not gonna
accept goodbye like this!

365
00:22:57,708 --> 00:22:59,041
[MIKU]
Me neither!

366
00:22:59,125 --> 00:23:01,791
Squad 13 isn't complete
without the two of you around!

367
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:04,208
[FUTOSHI]
So, come back with Zero Two!

368
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:05,666
[IKUNO]
Yeah!

369
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:07,083
You guys.

370
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:08,416
[ICHIGO]
Zero Two!

371
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,500
It doesn't matter
how long it takes.

372
00:23:10,583 --> 00:23:12,750
Make sure you come
back with Hiro!

373
00:23:12,833 --> 00:23:16,916
We'll build a home
and wait for you!

374
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:20,958
[chuckles] You are
always so bossy!

375
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:22,583
I promise.

376
00:23:22,666 --> 00:23:26,666
I'll come back to you
with my darling.

377
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:34,458
[KOKORO] Everyone has their
own feelings and desires.

378
00:23:34,541 --> 00:23:37,916
We're all looking for
somewhere to belong.

379
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:42,083
Strelitzia looked so
beautiful at that moment.

380
00:23:42,166 --> 00:23:45,375
Or so everyone who saw
it would tell us later.

381
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,708
[KOKORO] Right now,
all we can do is pray.

382
00:23:50,791 --> 00:23:54,375
Pray that what is
waiting for those two...

383
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,708
...is a happy ending.
