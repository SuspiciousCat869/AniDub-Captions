What about the people
who are close to you?

317
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:58,083
Have you ever thought
about how they feel?

318
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,750
Never. That's how you are.

319
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:02,833
You run off, make your
own decisions,

320
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,625
and never stop to
think about us.

321
00:19:05,708 --> 00:19:08,125
Papa and the adults
are gone now.

322
00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:11,625
But forget freedom,
our hands are completely tied!

323
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,666
Have you stopped to think
about how worried we are

324
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,291
about all of this?

325
00:19:15,375 --> 00:19:18,291
When someone collapses,
all we can do is watch.

326
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:21,041
Yet we're trying our
damned hardest to live on!

327
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,708
But here you are,
running off to die!

328
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,083
What are we supposed to
understand about you?

329
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,375
There are people doing
all they can to support you

330
00:19:28,458 --> 00:19:30,416
because they want you to live!

331
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,875
And you trample their
feelings as you leave!

332
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:36,666
The hell do you want
understood about you?!

If Zero Two won't
smile for me again,

00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,750
then honestly, I might
as well be dead.

Hey, Goro! Knock it off!

00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,750
[MIKU] Do you think we'll
ever find something like that?

340
00:20:13,833 --> 00:20:15,000
Huh?

341
00:20:15,083 --> 00:20:17,416
[MIKU] Something that
means the world to us.

342
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:20,875
That we'd choose over
anything else, like him?

343
00:20:22,166 --> 00:20:24,666

It's different for each person.

Goro...? Thank you.

[GORO]
For what?

346
00:20:34,416 --> 00:20:37,791
[GORO] That was never
about how everyone felt.

347
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:40,666
It was all about me.

348
00:20:40,750 --> 00:20:44,208
I'm the one scared of the
world that I chose myself.

349
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:45,666
[GORO]
That's me.

[ICHIGO]
Yeah.

351
00:20:54,041 --> 00:20:56,583
[ICHIGO]
Same here.

352
00:20:56,666 --> 00:21:02,125
But... No one can swim in
the same river water twice.

353
00:21:02,208 --> 00:21:07,333
So all we can do... is find
our own true path in life.

354
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:13,208
[ICHIGO] We'll keep looking
for it, until we find it.

Our lives have only
just begun, you know?

Where are you guys going?

[ZOROME] But we're not just
doing this for you, ya hear me?

If we don't go up there and
kick those guys' asses,

366
00:22:30,708 --> 00:22:32,291
no amount of farming
can help us.

367

Letting them kill us or waiting
here to die isn't our style.

Exactly. Our lives have
only just begun, after all.

it better myself.

The Nines.

We don't want you to get
the wrong idea or anything.

00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:53,083
The sole reason we were
created was to fight.

376
00:22:53,166 --> 00:22:55,708
We're only interested in
fulfilling our purpose.

377
00:22:55,791 --> 00:22:59,166
And outer space doesn't sound
too bad for a resting place.

378
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:02,541
We don't have any
intention of dying.

379
00:23:02,625 --> 00:23:04,833
We'll be coming back home
to make even more fields

and continue living on,
come what may!

I won't fight it anymore.

Now you and I are even.

This path, it's what we've
chosen in order to live.

You don't get to
fight it, either.

what you have now,

you'll never grasp any kind
