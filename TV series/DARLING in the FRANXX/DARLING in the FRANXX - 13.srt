Yeah.

[HIRO gasps]

00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:54,125
who lived at the
edge of the forest,

316
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,458
and said, 'I want to
live as a human.

317
00:18:57,541 --> 00:19:00,250
I want to be united with him.'

318
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:04,833
The witch replied like so,
'I can help you, if you offer

319
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:09,750
me your wings.
But, keep this in mind.

320
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,208
No matter how you disguise
yourself, you are a beast,

321
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:17,583
and you will consume the
prince's life one day.'"

322
00:19:21,958 --> 00:19:26,666
Sorry. I was just thinking
how sad this story is.

323
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,333
Is it only because one of them
isn't human that the prince and

324
00:19:29,416 --> 00:19:31,375
the princess can't get married?

325
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:32,750
[ZERO TWO]
Awwi?

326
00:19:32,833 --> 00:19:35,500
[HIRO] Yeah. That's what
it's called when two people

327
00:19:35,583 --> 00:19:39,250
who love each other promise
to be together forever.

328
00:19:39,333 --> 00:19:42,541
Or at least, it would be
if they were both human.

329
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:47,000
[ZERO TWO grunts]

330
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:51,250
[HIRO sighs] Well.
C'mon, let's walk some more.

331
00:19:51,333 --> 00:19:52,125
[ZERO TWO grunts]

332
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:55,333
Are you okay? Let me see.

333
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:59,333
[HIRO gasps]
It's blue?

334
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:02,000
Uh, anyway, I need
something to--

335
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:07,125
[ZERO TWO grunts]

336
00:20:07,208 --> 00:20:08,708
Endure it, okay?

337
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,958
I read in a book that animals
lick their wounds to heal them.

338
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:12,833
And it's all I've got.

339
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:15,916
[ZERO TWO gasps]

340
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:25,125
Awwi?

341
00:20:25,208 --> 00:20:26,125
[HIRO gasps]

342
00:20:26,208 --> 00:20:30,125
Awwi. Awwi?

343
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:34,208
[HIRO chuckles]
Once we get outta here,

344
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:36,875
'cause I wanna be
with you forever, too.

345
00:20:36,958 --> 00:20:39,625
And that way I can always be...

346
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:40,458
...darling.

347
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:42,125
[gasps]

348
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,916
Da...

349
00:20:47,791 --> 00:20:51,916
[ZERO TWO] I don't know why,
but tears flowed from my eyes.

350
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,625
It wasn't because my wound hurt.

351
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,500
It's a mistletoe.

352
00:20:57,583 --> 00:21:02,541
[ZERO TWO] Yeah, those were
probably tears of joy.

353
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,958
The picture book's
world was pretty,

354
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:10,083
and I believed that if I was
with him, I could be the same.

355
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,791
[ZERO TWO]
But, this world didn't allow it.

356
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,833
[HIRO]
Why? Why is it?

357
00:21:18,916 --> 00:21:21,375
Am I not able to find
the answers I seek...

358
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:23,541
...because I'm just a child,

359
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,666
who doesn't have the power
to protect anyone?

360
00:21:26,750 --> 00:21:29,708
[ZERO TWO] Why didn't I
realize that he and I

361
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:34,791
were different creatures,
with blood of different colors,

362
00:21:34,875 --> 00:21:38,458
and that I... was a monster?

363
00:21:40,333 --> 00:21:41,791
[MALE GUARD 13A]
That's what you get...

364
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,791
[FRANXX] Erase those memories.
They're noise.

365
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,125
[ZERO TWO]
Darling!

366
00:21:46,208 --> 00:21:47,958
[ICHIGO] Aren't you gonna
give them names anymore?

367
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:48,916
[MITSURU]
You liar!

368
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:49,791
[NANA]
This is bad.

369
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,583
[MALE VOICE 13A]
Monster.

370
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:55,500
[ZERO TWO] So, that's why
I swore to become human,

371
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:59,458
no matter what it took,
or what I had to do.

372
00:21:59,541 --> 00:22:04,375
If I were the same as him,
I could be with him forever.

373
00:22:06,083 --> 00:22:07,125
[ALL]
Delphinium!

374
00:22:07,208 --> 00:22:11,833
[ICHIGO screams]

375
00:22:11,916 --> 00:22:14,083
[ICHIGO] Hiro, get away
from Zero Two, right now!

376
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:16,916
She only got closer to you so
that she could suck you dry!

377
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:21,083
If you stay with her, even you
will lose your humanity!

378
00:22:21,166 --> 00:22:25,083
[ZERO TWO]
That's right. After all, I...

379
00:22:25,166 --> 00:22:26,208
[HIRO]
The picture book.

380
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:27,500
[ZERO TWO gasps]

381
00:22:29,416 --> 00:22:32,791
That was you. You were the girl.

382
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:35,833
The one with the
picture book back then.

383
00:22:35,916 --> 00:22:39,000
[ZERO TWO gasps]
