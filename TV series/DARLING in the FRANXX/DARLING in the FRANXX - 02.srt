Connecting feels so strange.

156
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,875
I hope we get used to it soon.

157
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:41,541
It's nothing like how
the training units felt.

158
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:42,791
[KOKORO yelps]

159
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:44,208
[MIKU] But no amount of
training could prepare

160
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,666
the young parasites for
this sensation, for it is like

161
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,250
their bodies are being
stirred up from the inside!

162
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,625
Here it comes! Are you ready?

163
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,666
[IKUNO] Cut it out. I don't
wanna think about it.

00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:54,625
[ICHIGO]
Was it rough for you guys?

165
00:08:54,708 --> 00:08:58,083
I thought it felt weird,
but I dunno.

166
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,625
[ICHIGO] Personally, the whole
thing put me more at ease.

167
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:04,666
Like I'd become
one with another.

[MIKU]
What?

169
00:09:06,041 --> 00:09:07,875
[KOKORO]
Sounds amazing.

170
00:09:07,958 --> 00:09:10,625
I wish my numbers
were as high as yours.

171

I guess you and Goro must
be really compatible.

Oh, gee, thanks.

175
00:09:23,833 --> 00:09:26,625
[MIKU] But speaking
of elite, how about Hiro?

176
00:09:26,708 --> 00:09:30,125
Out of nowhere, he shows up with
a girl and after one ride, boop!

177
00:09:30,208 --> 00:09:32,375
She calls him "darling." He, he!

178

I don't really get it,

Now. We'll begin the drill.

This'll be your first
one in a real FRANXX,

189
00:10:06,666 --> 00:10:10,208
so relax and stay calm. So long
as you trust your partner

190
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:12,875
and follow their movements,
you'll do fine.

191

[MIKU]
It's a natural reaction!

195

Partners can't afford
to be out of synch.

196
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:27,958
Their para-capacity
will fluctuate.

197

You must trust your partner and
accept them wholeheartedly.

I'm fine. Keep going.

How was that?
It didn't suck, right?

Mm-mm. You did just fine!

We're a good match, aren't we?

spare us the touchy-feely crap!

be bragging, it's me.

We shouldn't compete
with each other.

The stamen controls handling,

but the pistil connects
to the FRANXX.

So, you have to make sure she
can keep up with your movements.

If they would just let
me ride with Zero Two

223
00:11:58,375 --> 00:12:01,416
in Strelizia again, then I...

224
00:12:10,583 --> 00:12:14,375
[NANA] A startup trial
in an actual FRANXX?

225
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:21,083
I've almost figured out
the secret to connecting.

I'm so close.

Hey! Wait a sec!

Why'd you pick Hiro?

"Hiro"? You mean my darling?

What does that even mean?

Look, everyone's grateful that
you stopped the klaxosaur

But, from now on, I want
you to stay away from Hiro!

234
00:12:41,583 --> 00:12:42,583
Why's that?

235
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,625
Because you're not
part of our squad.

236

That means you'll leave one day.

getting Hiro's hopes up.

are you to my darling?

able to fight like that one day?

246

[FUTOSHI grunts]
Against the klaxosaurs.

247
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:19,666
Like what Hiro did in
that girl's FRANXX.

Huh?

249

What he did out there is not
what I would call "piloting."

You know that jerk
can't handle a FRANXX.

[FUTOSHI] But it did move
around with him inside.

00:13:28,708 --> 00:13:31,333

an interest in Hiro, too.

00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:32,875
[ZOROME]
So what?

254
00:13:32,958 --> 00:13:35,541
[MITSURU] I heard another rumor
about that Zero Two pistil.

255
00:13:35,625 --> 00:13:38,125
They say she has the special
ability to pilot a FRANXX

256
00:13:38,208 --> 00:13:40,791
all by herself. You saw
that four-legged form?

257
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:43,916
She controlled that alone.
Hiro was no pilot,

258
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:47,208
he was along for the ride
as cargo and nothing more.

259

What did I tell you?!

260
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:51,666
There's no way that loser
piloted a FRANXX before us!

I really thought you were
gonna be able to dodge that.

00:14:07,208 --> 00:14:08,333
Where've you been?

Playing with yourself
in a training unit?

That is the best you can do.

The closest thing you
can get to action

piloted that thing.

You wouldn't forget your
first time if you did!

she's not part of our squad.

Besides, if the purpose
is to test Hiro's aptitude,

303
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,541
it should work just
as well with me.

But then why does it have
to be you of all people?

Don't forget. You already
have a partner,

with someone else?

of Strelizia at this time.
