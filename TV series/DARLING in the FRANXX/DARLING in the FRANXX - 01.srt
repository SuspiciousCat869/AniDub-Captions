1
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:18,666
[ZERO TWO] The Jyan, also known
as "the bird that shares wings,"

2
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:21,333
only possesses one wing.

3
00:00:23,041 --> 00:00:25,666
[ZERO TWO] Unless a male and
female pair lean on each other

4
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:28,916
and act as one,
they're incapable of flight.

5
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,916
They're imperfect,
incomplete creatures.

6
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:34,416
[ZERO TWO sighs]

7
00:00:36,958 --> 00:00:38,125
[ZERO TWO gasps]

8
00:00:43,458 --> 00:00:46,041
[ZERO TWO]
But, for some reason...

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,500
[ZERO TWO] ...their way
of life... struck me as...

10
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,833
...profoundly beautiful.

11
00:00:54,916 --> 00:00:58,000
It was beautiful, I felt.

12
00:01:07,208 --> 00:01:09,125
[ZERO TWO]
I wanna take a bath.

13
00:01:09,208 --> 00:01:12,083
[FRANXX] Not again.
Show some self-restraint.

14
00:01:12,166 --> 00:01:15,791
[sniffs] Hey, how do I smell?

15
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,916
[FRANXX]
Let the man rest.

16
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,541
That last battle
took a lot out of him.

17
00:01:20,625 --> 00:01:24,625
My goodness, why must she always
be such high maintenance?

18
00:01:24,708 --> 00:01:27,000
[ZERO TWO] Does Plantation
13 have an ocean?

19
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:28,333
[NANA]
Why do you ask?

20
00:01:28,416 --> 00:01:30,500
[ZERO TWO] I wanna swim
in some clear ocean water.

21
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:33,208
[NANA] I'm sorry to tell you
there's no ocean down there.

22
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:34,666
Can't you just take a shower?

23
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:36,625
[ZERO TWO]
I'm in the mood for a swim.

24
00:01:36,708 --> 00:01:38,291
[MALE PILOT A] We'll be
starting our descent soon.

25
00:01:38,375 --> 00:01:40,166
Please take your
seats and buckle up.

26
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:43,416
[NANA]
You got it. Save that thought.

27
00:01:46,166 --> 00:01:48,791
Ugh, I really hate how I taste.

28
00:01:50,583 --> 00:01:54,041
[HIRO] The Jian is also known
as "the bird that shares wings."

29
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,666
I read a book about them a long
time ago that said they can't

30
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,500
even fly unless a male and a
female support each other.

31
00:02:00,583 --> 00:02:02,458
They're pitiful creatures.

32
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:07,958
[HIRO]
Until one finds a partner,

33
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:10,416
it must hide amongst
the tree leaves.

34
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,250
Waiting with baited breath.

35
00:02:12,333 --> 00:02:14,500
Dreaming of the day when
it can finally take flight

36
00:02:14,583 --> 00:02:16,416
into the skies above.

37
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:18,083
[thud]

38
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,000
Blood.

39
00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,125
[chirping]

40
00:02:29,208 --> 00:02:30,583
[gasps]

41
00:02:33,458 --> 00:02:35,208
[HIRO]
Hey, wait.

42
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:39,416
[HIRO] So then where does a bird
that ends up never flying go?

43
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:40,458
[gasps]

44
00:02:43,958 --> 00:02:46,666
[HIRO] I know the answer
to that all too well.

45
00:02:48,125 --> 00:02:49,791
[HIRO]
The answer is...

46
00:02:49,875 --> 00:02:52,041
[ZERO TWO gasps]
Found one.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:02,500
[FUTOSHI]
"Partner Killer"?

48
00:03:02,583 --> 00:03:03,666
[ZOROME]
That's right.

49
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:06,000
Apparently, the girl
has horns and fangs.

50
00:03:06,083 --> 00:03:08,208
They say that after the third
time any parasite rides

51
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,875
with her, he has his blood
sucked out and winds up dead,

52
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,083
without fail.

53
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,125
[FUTOSHI] Ugh. I don't
wanna ride with her.

54
00:03:14,208 --> 00:03:16,458
[MIKU] Oh, come on.
That's just a rumor, isn't it?

55
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:18,166
[ZOROME]
It's 100 percent true!

56
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,541
I know somebody who
actually overheard security

57
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:22,083
talking about it.

58
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,958
[GORO]
Ichigo. Any word from Hiro?

59
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:28,291
[ICHIGO]
No, not yet.

60
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,541
[ZOROME]
Speaking of...

61
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:32,750
Is he really gonna stick
around here after all?

62
00:03:32,833 --> 00:03:34,750
Well, he didn't show up
at today's briefing,

63
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,000
for whatever that's worth.

64
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,708
It could mean he's
turning down the offer.

65
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:41,500
Hiro's leaving?
But that'll be so sad.

66
00:03:41,583 --> 00:03:44,333
If he does quit,
where does that leave Naomi,

67
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,583
who was also caught
up in his issues?

68
00:03:46,666 --> 00:03:49,083
[MITSURU] I say he's showing
some real integrity.

69
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,333
Besides, it's gotta be hard
for him to face us all

70
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,666
after what happened.

71
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,333
Try putting yourselves in
his shoes for a change.

72
00:03:54,416 --> 00:03:55,958
Gimme a break.

73
00:03:56,041 --> 00:03:58,625
You all right, Ichigo?

74
00:03:58,708 --> 00:04:00,416
He's such an idiot!

75
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:05,125
[FRANXX] Good grief.
These transport planes' seats

76
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:07,375
are too rugged for
an old man like me.

77
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,583
Can't we find some
other means of travel?

78
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,291
[NANA] You'll just
have to deal with it.

79
00:04:11,375 --> 00:04:13,083
We don't have many
options when it comes to

80
00:04:13,166 --> 00:04:14,916
transporting cargo of this size.

81
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,541
[FRANXX]
I haven't seen you in ages,

82
00:04:16,625 --> 00:04:18,958
but it seems you're
still as stiff as ever.

83
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,750
Wish the seats
and your personality

84
00:04:20,833 --> 00:04:22,875
could be this soft and yielding.

85
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:24,875
Knock it off, Doctor!

86
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,541
[FRANXX]
How's Hachi doing?

87
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,791
[NANA] He's been asked to speed
up the children's training.

88
00:04:30,875 --> 00:04:33,041
After all, this will be
our first trial run

89
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:34,875
for the unit we're
using this time.

90
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,458
[FRANXX]
I see.

91
00:04:36,541 --> 00:04:39,333
Doctor, may I ask you something?

92
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:42,208
Why run the test case
here of all places?

93
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,875
And with such a
makeshift team, no less?

94
00:04:44,958 --> 00:04:47,083
[FRANXX]
Something's been bothering me.

95
00:04:47,166 --> 00:04:49,458
The geezers in APE
might not understand it,

96
00:04:49,541 --> 00:04:51,875
but it troubles me nonetheless.

97
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:55,083
So you do have some
sort of idea in mind.

98
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:57,833
Oh, and while I'm
thinking about it,

99
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,458
please do attend the
startup ritual, Doctor.

100
00:05:00,541 --> 00:05:02,958
[FRANXX]
Yes, I know. By the way,

101
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:06,208
I see that our little problem
child has already gone missing.

102
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,125
[NANA gasps]
She was here just a second ago.

103
00:05:10,208 --> 00:05:11,750
[FRANXX]
Look there.

104
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:16,541
[NANA gasps]

105
00:05:16,625 --> 00:05:18,958
Damn! Always running off.

106
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:21,875
[footsteps]

107
00:05:23,541 --> 00:05:24,333
[chirping]

108
00:05:24,416 --> 00:05:27,208
[gasps] It's still alive!

109
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,291
[HIRO] I never knew there
was a place like this here.

110
00:05:36,833 --> 00:05:38,375
[HIRO]
A parasite?

111
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:42,000
But that uniform doesn't
look like ours at all.

112
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:42,958
[splashing]

113
00:05:43,041 --> 00:05:44,083
[HIRO grunts]

114
00:05:47,125 --> 00:05:48,458
[gasps]

115
00:05:55,625 --> 00:05:58,000
[gasps, grunts]

116
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:13,833
[gasps] Oh, no! She's drowning!

117
00:06:13,916 --> 00:06:15,208
I've gotta help her!

118
00:06:15,291 --> 00:06:16,666
[HIRO yelps]

119
00:06:19,458 --> 00:06:22,625
[HIRO] It was like I'd
been put under a spell.

120
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:25,291
Between those two
alluring horns,

121
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,000
and my first-ever glimpse
of a naked girl's body,

122
00:06:28,083 --> 00:06:32,166
I was transfixed, unable to
take my eyes off her.

123
00:06:37,333 --> 00:06:41,583
[HIRO gasps] You're... You're...
You're naked! I'm sorry!

124
00:06:41,666 --> 00:06:45,625
Wow. And here I thought
you were dead.

125
00:06:45,708 --> 00:06:48,583
Hey, are you a parasite?

126
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:51,500
And what were you doing
bathing out here?

127
00:06:51,583 --> 00:06:53,625
[ZERO TWO]
It's weird.

128
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:57,000
I thought ocean water was
supposed to be salty.

129
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,875
Uh, this isn't an ocean.

130
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:01,958
Yeah, I'm aware of that.

131
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,458
But this puddle's the closest
thing I could find to an ocean

132
00:07:04,541 --> 00:07:07,000
around these parts,
so here we are.

133
00:07:07,083 --> 00:07:08,833
Well, aren't you gonna swim?

134
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,458
[HIRO]
Uh? Me? No, I'm good.

135
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:15,000
Really? But it feels so nice.

136
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:16,250
And the way you were staring,

137
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:18,250
I thought you wanted
to take a dip, too.

138
00:07:18,333 --> 00:07:19,708
[HIRO]
I wasn't staring.

139
00:07:19,791 --> 00:07:22,416
I was worried that you were
drowning out there, okay?

140
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,291
I jumped in to save you and--

141
00:07:24,375 --> 00:07:26,000
[gasps]

142
00:07:26,083 --> 00:07:29,916
Uh, would you mind, y'know,
putting clothes on?

143
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,500
[ZERO TWO] Hm. I get it!
You're some kind of pervert!

144
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:36,833
[gasps] What, why?

145
00:07:39,125 --> 00:07:42,666
[HIRO yelps]
It's not what it looks like!

146
00:07:45,875 --> 00:07:48,375
[giggles]

147
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,791
You should see your face!

148
00:07:49,875 --> 00:07:52,750
[ZERO TWO giggling]

149
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:53,958
[ZERO TWO]
But, hey.

150
00:07:54,041 --> 00:07:55,916
You really jumped in
to save me, didn't you?

151
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,041
I appreciate it. So thank you.

152
00:08:03,125 --> 00:08:06,458
[ZERO TWO] That uniform.
Are you a parasite, too?

153
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:07,708
[HIRO]
No.

154
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:09,458
[ZERO TWO]
So you don't pilot?

155
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:14,083
[HIRO] I can't pilot.
I no longer have the ability.

156
00:08:14,166 --> 00:08:17,000
Worse, I dragged my
partner down with me.

157
00:08:19,208 --> 00:08:21,708
[HIRO] I don't have

Your "darling"? Is that like
a partner or something?

Your ability's probably
still there, just lying dormant.

That's what she said.

Getting mocked for my lack of
a partner would be one thing,

we had code numbers
assigned to us,

our one purpose in life.

[FRANXX]
A moho-class, huh?

318
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,250
It's big and strong,
with a fine look.

319
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:32,375
This is no time to be
admiring its appearance!

320
00:17:32,458 --> 00:17:33,833
We have to get out of here!

321
00:17:33,916 --> 00:17:36,291
Hurry up and retrieve
the parasites!

322
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:38,041
What's going on out there?

Oh, great, now
there's a stampede?

329
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:01,791
[APE CHIEF] What a
wretched sight to behold.

330
00:18:01,875 --> 00:18:03,833
Has she devoured another stamen?

It's hard to tell which one

00:18:05,291 --> 00:18:06,583
is the real monster here.

Hey. Are you all right?

What are you doing in there?

What does it look like?

345
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,708
I'm going monster hunting,
of course.

346
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:12,208
You're gonna pilot this
thing all by yourself?

347
00:19:12,291 --> 00:19:13,500
[ZERO TWO]
I gotta go.

348
00:19:13,583 --> 00:19:17,208
Wait! Hold on a second!
You can't go like that!

349
00:19:17,291 --> 00:19:19,208
[ZERO TWO]
Get off me!

350
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:22,791
[HIRO] This is crazy.
Besides, you're on your own now.

351
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:25,458
FRANXX can't be piloted alone.

352
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:29,666
[ZERO TWO] I'm always alone.
It's been like that forever.

353
00:19:29,750 --> 00:19:31,291
I'm used to it.

354
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:33,666
Don't go! You'll die out there!

355
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:38,291
[ZERO TWO] So what?
I'm not afraid of death.

356
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:41,291
Sooner or later, that thing's
gonna start moving again.

357
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:44,083
And when it does,
everyone here is gonna die.

358
00:19:44,166 --> 00:19:46,125
But I'm not afraid of death.

359
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:50,541
And even if I were,
I'd still have a job to do.

360
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,708
Now, if you'll excuse me...

361
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:55,916
[HIRO]
"I'm powerless. Right now,

362

363
00:20:01,416 --> 00:20:04,708
That's what I kept thinking.
But as I stared at the girl

364
00:20:04,791 --> 00:20:07,250
standing in front of me,
for some reason,

365
00:20:07,333 --> 00:20:10,958
the words that escaped
my lips were...

366
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:15,791
[HIRO] Wait. I'll pilot
that robot with you.

367
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:19,166
I'm not about to let you
do this on your own.

368
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:23,500
Oh? And are you prepared to die?

369
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,458
I don't know that.

370
00:20:25,541 --> 00:20:30,333
But what I do know is, right
now, I don't belong anywhere.

371
00:20:30,416 --> 00:20:32,625
Which means I might
as well be dead.

372
00:20:32,708 --> 00:20:36,000
So please, take me with you!

373
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:39,500
[ZERO TWO] Mm. You really
are just like me.

374
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:41,958
You and I are very similar.

375
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:46,250
Haven't seen a human cry
in quite a long time.

376
00:20:46,333 --> 00:20:48,583
I like the look in your eyes.

377
00:20:48,666 --> 00:20:50,583
It makes my heart race.

00:20:52,375 --> 00:20:54,250
[ZERO TWO]
Now, come to me.

now my darling!

It's back up!

00:21:25,250 --> 00:21:26,958
And heading this way!

384
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,416
Did it eat it?

385
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,958
[FRANXX]
No... That's...

386
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,500
[FRANXX]
When negative and positive,

387
00:21:56,583 --> 00:21:59,625
the male and female factors,
combine, and their hearts

388
00:21:59,708 --> 00:22:04,333
become one, the iron maiden
will reveal her true form.

389
00:22:08,416 --> 00:22:10,416
[FRANXX]
Now this is a FRANXX!

390
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:13,208
Beautiful, isn't it?
You're the best, Strelizia!

391
00:22:13,291 --> 00:22:15,458
Yeah, but who's piloting it?

392
00:22:37,916 --> 00:22:39,375
[ZERO TWO]
Game over.

393
00:23:02,125 --> 00:23:04,208
[ICHIGO]
So that's a FRANXX.

394
00:23:04,291 --> 00:23:06,541
The kind of robot
we'll be piloting.

395
00:23:13,666 --> 00:23:16,541
[HIRO] I don't know why,
but the warm touch of her lips

396
00:23:16,625 --> 00:23:19,958
against mine made
my heart race.

397
00:23:20,041 --> 00:23:21,500
Other than that, though,

398
00:23:21,583 --> 00:23:24,416
I remember nothing of what
happened in that cockpit.

399
00:23:27,208 --> 00:23:27,916
Hiro?

400
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,791
What's he doing in there?

401
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:33,083
[GORO] Wait, there's someone
with him. Are those...

402
00:23:33,166 --> 00:23:34,583
[MIKU]
...horns?

403
00:23:36,291 --> 00:23:39,125
[FUTOSHI]
You mean, that pistil is--?

404
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:41,791
[ICHIGO]
The Partner Killer.

405
00:23:41,875 --> 00:23:44,000
Here, allow me to
introduce you all.

406
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:47,500
That's Zero-Zero-Two, she's with
the special forces unit.

407
00:23:47,583 --> 00:23:49,833
Controlled by APE.

408
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:52,833
She's a girl that
carries klaxosaur blood.

409
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:58,291
[HIRO] However, after taking
this step of my own free will,

410
00:23:58,375 --> 00:24:03,041
I felt like, finally, I might
be able to fly again.

411
00:24:03,125 --> 00:24:06,166
I found you, my darling.
