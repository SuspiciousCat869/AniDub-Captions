Oh, good. That's a relief.

Hey, Hiro? Could you contact
the transport team for me?

163
00:09:55,666 --> 00:09:58,666
I can't exactly operate
this thing alone.

[HIRO]
Goro. Try to keep calm, okay?

[GORO gasps]
What does that mean?

168
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:10,416
We didn't eliminate the thing?

00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:14,166
[HIRO] As it exploded,
it swallowed Delphinium.

Not long after that,
we were ordered to retreat.

171
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:20,458
So for the moment, we're all
back at the plantation.

That's how it happened, huh?

gonna get you out of there!

Goro...

to leave you behind.

[GORO]
Don't worry about it.

179

Anyway, I'm wasting power here,

00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,875
so I'm gonna switch to

00:10:40,958 --> 00:10:44,041

All right. We'll be in touch.

Without a pistil

No need to worry.

You should still be in bed!

I need answers. What's this
about Goro getting swallowed up?

Like I already told you,
he was trying to save us and...

"And"? Why aren't we
rescuing him yet?

How could you turn tail?

This very second, he's trapped
inside that klaxosaur!

That fool. Why did he
cut me loose like that?

Without me, he knows
that he's helpless!

Ugh. So annoying. C'mon, girl.

How have you not realized
that Goro is always

you back on your feet?

You're always like,
"I'm the leader."

But when things go wrong, you
lose it and take it out on us.

Do you get what I'm saying?

Good, you're all here.

We've analyzed the samples
stuck on your units.

220

The results show this klaxosaur
can vaporize its bodily fluids

to expand and explode.

Wait. You mean what
Goro's stuck in

223
00:12:21,208 --> 00:12:23,041
is essentially its fuel source?

I do owe him one, after all.

the target from the plantation.

[KIDS gasp]

233
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:43,833
[HACHI] Estimated time of

one hour from now.

235
00:12:45,458 --> 00:12:47,125
We'll set up a last
line of defense,

236
00:12:47,208 --> 00:12:50,791
and eliminate the klaxosaur
before it crosses that line.

237
00:12:50,875 --> 00:12:54,291
But, sir, what if we can't
eliminate it by then?

238
00:12:54,375 --> 00:12:57,916
In that case, the planation
will open fire, as well.

239
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,041
The target will defend
itself by detonating its

Told ya so.

I've got this,

Just so we're clear,

00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,916
I never asked for your help.

00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,416
[ICHIGO]
Yeah, but we won.

326
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,750
Maybe we can't win alone,
but we can when we're together.

[GORO gasps]

328
00:17:40,166 --> 00:17:45,833
[GORO] Yeah. Ever since then,
I've loved Ichigo.

329
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:50,666
And always right
beside her... was Hiro.

330
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:08,625
[GORO]
But I was okay with that.

331
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:14,625
Because Hiro was special
to me, too. In his own way.

[IKUNO] We're in trouble
if it gets past us.

00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:32,041
[KOKORO] It'll be fine.
Just believe in Ichigo.

337
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:35,166
[GORO] I used to think I didn't
mind if my feelings never got

through to her. But, if there's
one thing I regret...

[breathes heavily]

[GORO] That's more than
enough to self-destruct.

00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:07,500
And there's the
backup fuel, too.

[chuckles] This is gonna
be one hell of a present.

I just wish I coulda told her.

Wow. The air's so thin.

[GORO]
Why'd you come?

349
00:19:35,333 --> 00:19:37,916
I said I'd save you
no matter what, right?

350
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,041
[GORO grunts] And I said
not to worry about me.

Yeah, well, you're an idiot,

so I knew you would try to
fix everything by yourself.

You're so headstrong,
even though you're weak.

Even though you can't
do anything without me.

00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,583
That doesn't mean
you had to come here.

That's where you're wrong.

You were willing to cry over me.

00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:10,458
I thought I could be
satisfied just knowing that...

...until a moment ago.

But now, seeing your face...
as you smile at me...

...is making me happier than
anything ever has before.

Quit being weird.

I had to tell you.
