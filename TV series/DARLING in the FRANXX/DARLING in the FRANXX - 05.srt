It's all according to schedule.

the parasites' numbers,
apparently.

[ZERO TWO] Is that why
there's a ceiling over it?

Prob'ly.

it's not like it doesn't rain.

Does that mean Hiro's
an official parasite now?

At the moment, that's
still under consideration.

[CODE 090]
Course not.

Our FRANXX have similar
bodies and equipment.

That makes it easier for all of

Huh.

I haven't felt this way
in such a long time.

312
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:34,875
I wanna give it my all
on this upcoming mission.

313
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:37,958
I don't want things to end
in failure, so please, ju--

314
00:14:38,041 --> 00:14:40,333
You want me to turn a blind eye?

315
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:41,625
[HIRO]
That's right.

316
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,083
And the others. You wanna
keep this from them?

317
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:44,958
That's right.

318
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,708
Even Ichigo?

319
00:14:46,791 --> 00:14:48,583
That's right.

320
00:14:48,666 --> 00:14:50,875
[grunts] You can't!

321
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:54,500
I'm sorry.

322
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:04,291
You are such a complete
and utter fool.

323
00:15:04,375 --> 00:15:06,500
[HACHI] An hour ago,
we detected klaxosaurs

324
00:15:06,583 --> 00:15:09,041
at a distance of
approximately 3,000.

325
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:10,458
There are anywhere
between a hundred

326
00:15:10,541 --> 00:15:12,375
and a hundred-fifty of them.

327
00:15:12,458 --> 00:15:13,916
A hundred-fifty!

328
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,250
[HACHI] That number is
expected to climb even higher.

329
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,875
Meanwhile, their ETA is
about 33 hours from now.

330
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,416
No matter how much
we try to rush it,

331
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:23,541
there's no way we can
complete the kissing process

332
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,875
before they arrive.

333
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:26,916
So we're going to position
a line of defense here,

334
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:30,166
with Squad 26 at the vanguard.

335
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:33,458
Behind them, Squad 13 will
stand by, serving as backup.

336
00:15:33,541 --> 00:15:35,500
Wait. Why are we the backup?

337
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,666
[CODE 090] This is gonna
be a chaotic dogfight.

338
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,791
Our squad can link up better
if we go at it by ourselves.

339
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:42,291
[ZOROME gasps]

340
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:44,333
Did he just call us deadweight?
'Cause it sounded like it.

341
00:15:44,416 --> 00:15:47,000
[HACHI] Ahem. Defending the
main pipe that links

342
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:50,000
the two plantations together
must be our top priority.

343
00:15:50,083 --> 00:15:52,625
Which is why I've decided
to deploy a single FRANXX

344
00:15:52,708 --> 00:15:55,208
capable of solo combat
there to guard it.

345
00:15:55,291 --> 00:15:58,625
[CODE 090] But what
FRANXX is up to that task?

346
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,666
You may know it as Strelizia.

347
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:01,458
[GORO grunts]

348
00:16:01,541 --> 00:16:02,875
[ALL gasp]

349
00:16:02,958 --> 00:16:07,500
Did you say... Strelitzia?
No way... You can't mean.

350
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,291
Excuse us. Sorry we're late.

351
00:16:10,375 --> 00:16:12,583
[CODE 090]
Code Zero-Zero-Two!

352
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,875
[HACHI]
Did Papa approve?

353
00:16:13,958 --> 00:16:15,416
Yes, we're a go.

354
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:19,750
Hiro will pilot Strelizia as
Zero Two's partner once again.

355
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:21,833
[HACHI] This is our best
course of action right now.

356
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,833
Got it.

357
00:16:22,916 --> 00:16:24,625
[CODE 090]
Hold on. We can't do it.

358
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:27,708
We will not fight
alongside Strelizia.

359
00:16:27,791 --> 00:16:29,000
[HACHI]
The plan is final.

360
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:30,500
But, sir.

361
00:16:30,583 --> 00:16:32,625
That girl doesn't care about
her allies in the slightest!

362
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:35,000
We can't trust her to have
our backs in the field!

363
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:39,166
Code Zero-Zero-Two has proven
that fact in the past.

364
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:40,375
What're you saying?

365
00:16:40,458 --> 00:16:42,125
[CODE 090] The joint
operation two years ago!

366

When your reckless and utterly
selfish fighting style wound up

367
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:47,250
leaving us isolated out
there on the battleground,

368
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:51,291
and I lost my partner!

369

[CODE 090 breathes heavily]

370
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,416
Too bad. Doesn't ring any bells.

Weaklings die all the time.
Big deal. It happens.

[CODE 090 gasps]

373

Stop. I'll watch Zero Two
and keep her under control.

00:17:08,458 --> 00:17:12,625
As Strelizia's stamen,
you have my word.

375
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:14,708
[ZOROME] Where does that
guy get off treating us like

376
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,125
we'd be in the way?

377
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:19,708
[MITSURU] He may not be wrong.
We are a makeshift team.

378
00:17:19,791 --> 00:17:22,541
[IKUNO] But it still pisses
you off, doesn't it?

379
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,041
[GORO] I agree with them.
With Squad 26.

380
00:17:25,125 --> 00:17:26,583
[ZOROME]
Huh?

381
00:17:26,666 --> 00:17:28,833
Strelizia shouldn't be getting
anywhere near this mission,

Uh. No! He's right, Goro.

What do you think, Ichigo?

00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,166
I think that we need Strelizia.

[ICHIGO] However, I need you to
stay in line during the mission.

I'm the leader here,
and you will follow my orders.

to do again, huh?

[ICHIGO] Please, don't push
Hiro too hard.

Don't forget, my darling said
he wanted to ride with me.

[ICHIGO]
I know that.

405
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,333
But can you at least try to not
put such a heavy burden on him?

406
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,166
[ZERO TWO] Do you want
me to give him to you?

407
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,166
[ICHIGO gasps]

408
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,791
You already tried
riding with him,

and it didn't work, remember?

[ICHIGO]
You leave me out of this!

Then stop putting
yourself into this.

[ICHIGO gasps] Are you
trying to suck Hiro dry?

[ICHIGO gasps] He could
die out there, you know!

didn't amount to much.

That's right.

Yeah.

off this ride, say it.
