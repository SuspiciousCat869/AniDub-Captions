[NANA] Unlike past missions, the
enemy will counter with numbers.

166
00:10:05,333 --> 00:10:06,666
This will, without a doubt,

167

Before the mission
gets underway,

we'll have no choice.

Squad 13 will not participate
in the operation.

You must understand, this was
our decision as a whole.

The simple fact is, we can't
fight with her anymore.

No matter how I disguised
myself as a human,

I could never be one of you.

He got out from there?

315
00:17:20,041 --> 00:17:22,541
Reckless as always.

316
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,666
[ICHIGO]
Hiro... Why?

317
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,708
[ZERO TWO]
You tricked me.

318
00:17:29,333 --> 00:17:32,958
[ZERO TWO]
You... lied to me.

319
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:36,208
No! We didn't plan for this
to happen. Believe us!

320
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:38,666
He must've-- That's it!
He left to find you!

321
00:17:38,750 --> 00:17:39,958
[ZERO TWO]
Shut up!

322
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:45,250
Zero Two, it's me.

323
00:17:45,333 --> 00:17:48,250
I um... I have a question.

324
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,916
And there's something
I wanna talk about.

325
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,708
Do you remember when you said
you weren't afraid to die?

326
00:17:54,791 --> 00:17:56,458
I'm the same.

327
00:17:56,541 --> 00:18:02,125
But that's why I wanna make
sure of, well, several things.

328
00:18:02,208 --> 00:18:04,250
Like, did you...?

329
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,708
[HIRO] Did you use me?
Knowing all along?

330
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:15,458
[HIRO]
Zero Two? Are you--

331
00:18:15,541 --> 00:18:16,666
[gasps]

332
00:18:19,875 --> 00:18:21,333
[HIRO]
What happened?

333
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,708
[HIRO gasps]

334
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:37,708
--[ZERO TWO giggles]
--[ALL groan]

335
00:18:37,791 --> 00:18:40,875
[ZERO TWO]
You humans are so weak.

336
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:44,625
Now do you get it? I won't
let anyone stand in my way.

337
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,916
[HIRO]
Zero Two!

338
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,166
[ZERO TWO]
Darling.

339
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,333
What're you doing?

340
00:18:51,416 --> 00:18:54,458
I had to see you, darling.

341
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,083
There's something I want
to talk to you about.

342
00:18:57,166 --> 00:19:02,250
Ichigo! Are you okay?
Talk to me. Ichigo.

343
00:19:02,333 --> 00:19:04,666
[ICHIGO]
Hiro... Run away.

344
00:19:04,750 --> 00:19:08,833
[HIRO gasps]
Why would you do this?

345
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,666
[ZERO TWO]
"Why"?

346
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,541
You asked me to speak
my mind with you, remember?

347
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:19,666
When I tried, these guys
wouldn't let me, so I...

348
00:19:19,750 --> 00:19:20,833
[HIRO]
No.

349
00:19:20,916 --> 00:19:23,833
[ZERO TWO]
Let's talk. Lots and lots, okay?

350
00:19:23,916 --> 00:19:26,541
It's not too late.
We can still take it back--

351
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:31,333
Zero Two! Right now,
you truly are a monster.

352
00:19:31,416 --> 00:19:34,083
You aren't human.

353
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:38,083
[ZERO TWO]
This... is punishment.

354
00:19:38,166 --> 00:19:40,166
I set up the boy who
was the sole reason

355
00:19:40,250 --> 00:19:42,500
I wanted to be human.

356
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:46,375
I tried to make him the
same kind of monster as me.

357
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:49,958
And this is my punishment.

358
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,041
[FUTOSHI groans]

359
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:12,208
[door clatters]

360
00:20:26,916 --> 00:20:28,541
[door clatters]

361
00:20:44,125 --> 00:20:46,833
I'm sorry, but this
was for the best, Hiro.

362
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:48,333
Let's go in--

363
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,375
[gasps]

364
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:18,000
[HIRO, ICHIGO gasp]

365
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:20,958
[ICHIGO]
You can't! I won't let you!

366
00:21:21,041 --> 00:21:23,000
I'm not letting you go!

367
00:21:23,083 --> 00:21:25,125
Because if you go
back to Zero Two,

368
00:21:25,208 --> 00:21:27,166
you'll turn into a monster!

369
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:29,625
You won't be the
same ever again!

370
00:21:29,708 --> 00:21:31,666
I'd rather die than
let that happen!

371
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:34,041
[HIRO sighs]
But I...

372
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,041
[HIRO gasps]

373
00:21:46,791 --> 00:21:50,458
Welcome home.
Nine Iota. Take a look.

374
00:21:50,541 --> 00:21:54,791
The doctor brought a good
selection here all for you.

375
00:21:54,875 --> 00:21:57,166
Use as many as you like.

376
00:21:58,375 --> 00:22:01,166
[HIRO gasps]

377
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:02,666
[GORO gasps]

378
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:04,833
[ICHIGO] Our kiss, the one we
shared in the mock battle.

379
00:22:04,916 --> 00:22:10,666
I don't regret it. I want
to be with you. Forever.

380
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:14,291
I'll make it so I can ride
with you this time, I swear.

381
00:22:14,375 --> 00:22:17,333
I can do anything if
I'm doing it for you, Hiro.

382
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:23,250
It's true... I mean...
I've... The thing is...

383
00:22:23,333 --> 00:22:25,541
You've always been
my everything!

384
00:22:25,625 --> 00:22:28,541
I've known. Ever since
we were little kids!

385
00:22:28,625 --> 00:22:31,416
I've always had eyes
for you and you alone.

386
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:33,208
I love...

387
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:37,541
I love you, Hiro!

388
00:22:37,625 --> 00:22:42,625
