It looks like they're
moving in a pack,

00:00:32,625 --> 00:00:36,083
which means that huge thing
could be a klaxosaur as well.

Hey, don't go whimping out.
They may have the numbers,

And while he's busy

to say goodbye to me?

314
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,916
I found a place for myself.

315
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,208
And it's all thanks
to you that I did.

316
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:06,875
I belonged as a child again.
If only for a bit.

317
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,333
[HIRO gasps]
Hey, wait.

318
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:17,416
Why do you look so sad?

319
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:20,541
[ZERO TWO yells]

320
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,416
[HIRO gasps]

321
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:25,916
[ZERO TWO grunts]

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,291
[HIRO gasps]
What?

323
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:32,625
[chokes]

324
00:18:36,083 --> 00:18:40,375
[HIRO]
Wait, we didn't kill it? Oh, no.

325
00:18:40,458 --> 00:18:45,041
[ZERO TWO shouts]

326
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:49,375
[ZERO TWO] You. You're
nothing but a monster!

327
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:54,041
[HIRO] Zero Two, stop!
You can't do this alone!

328
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:57,250
If you keep this up,
even you will die!

329
00:18:57,333 --> 00:19:00,375
What reason do you
have to fight so hard?

330
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:04,291
[ZERO TWO] Reason?
Maybe because I'm a monster.

331
00:19:04,375 --> 00:19:07,000
[HIRO] Is this how it's
always been for you?

332
00:19:07,083 --> 00:19:10,916
You lose your partner
and fight on alone?

333
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,791
Can you not fly
by yourself, either?

334
00:19:13,875 --> 00:19:16,583
You need someone, too?

335
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:20,958
[ZERO TWO] I'm always alone,
thanks to these horns.

336
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:30,041
[HIRO]
What the hell is wrong with me?

337
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:34,333
Zero Two's suffering
and I'm doing nothing!

338
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,375
I want to help you.

339
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:40,916
I want to ride with
you in Strelizia again.

340
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,083
My wings... exist for you!

341
00:19:55,333 --> 00:20:00,291
[ZERO TWO gasps, shouts]

342
00:20:07,625 --> 00:20:09,708
[ZERO TWO gasps]

343
00:20:13,625 --> 00:20:16,666
Dar... ling?

344
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:21,750
I'm your partner, Zero Two.
I won't leave you all alone.

345
00:21:06,541 --> 00:21:09,083
[ALL gasp]

346
00:21:09,166 --> 00:21:12,958
Wait. Hiro's... still alive?

347
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,083
[ICHIGO]
Hiro.

348
00:21:15,166 --> 00:21:17,875
[NANA] Hiro's vital signs
are all reading normal.

349
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,333
What's going on?

350
00:21:19,416 --> 00:21:20,250
[FRANXX]
Oh?

351
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,375
[NANA gasps]
Doctor?

352
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,833
[KOKORO]
It's changing forms again!

353
00:21:28,916 --> 00:21:30,208
[MITSURU]
We can't let it!

354
00:21:30,291 --> 00:21:31,833
[MIKU]
Don't just stand there, Ichigo!

355
00:21:31,916 --> 00:21:33,125
Come on!

356
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,416
[IKUNO]
Now's our chance!

357
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,625
[FUTOSHI]
It's our turn!

358
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,250
[ZOROME]
Let's give 'em a hand!

359
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,458
[GORO] Create another
opening for Strelizia!

360
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:42,625
[ICHIGO]
Right!

361
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:55,875
[ICHIGO]
Hiro! Zero Two!

362
00:21:58,333 --> 00:21:59,208
[ZERO TWO]
Let's fly...

363
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:00,500
Yeah!

364
00:22:00,583 --> 00:22:02,791
[ZERO TWO] ...with the
wings I share with you!

365
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:06,958
With the wings
I share with you!

366
00:22:08,166 --> 00:22:13,125
[ZERO TWO, HIRO shout]

367
00:22:33,375 --> 00:22:35,208
Those were wings.

368
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,541
[FRANXX]
That boy.

369
00:22:36,625 --> 00:22:40,625
He might just make
Zero Two's wish come true.

370
00:22:42,375 --> 00:22:43,750
[HIRO]
Zero Two?

371
00:22:43,833 --> 00:22:45,291
[ZERO TWO]
Mm?

372
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:48,166
[HIRO] I found another
reason for why I fight.

373
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:50,000
Why I pilot a Franxx.

374
00:22:50,083 --> 00:22:52,750
[ZERO TWO]
Really? What is it?

375
00:22:54,791 --> 00:22:58,166
Because I want to be your wings.

376
00:22:58,250 --> 00:23:01,458
Though, I don't know what'll
happen to me next time.

377
00:23:01,541 --> 00:23:06,583
You'll be fine. Next and every
other time, my darling.

378
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,000
[HIRO] The Jian, also known as
"the bird that shares wings",

379
00:23:11,083 --> 00:23:13,833
only possesses one wing.

380
00:23:13,916 --> 00:23:17,291
When a male and female lean
on each other and act as one,

381
00:23:17,375 --> 00:23:20,416
they can fly as high and
as far as they want.

382
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:28,875
[HIRO] If I can be your wings,
then even if my life burns out,

383
00:23:28,958 --> 00:23:32,791
I'll keep leaning
on you, right here.

384
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:49,458
[HIRO] Because, that may
be my purpose in life.

385
00:23:52,833 --> 00:23:56,291
[ZERO TWO] There are still so
many klaxosaurs I have to kill.

386
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,083
[9'a]
Well, well.

387
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:06,750
You're certainly hitting it off,
aren't you, Nine Iota?
