Are the rumors about her true?

That she's a "partner killer"?

It's complex.

individual that must be kept

be her partner.

00:15:24,208 --> 00:15:27,125
I was afraid to ride
with you, I admit it!

268
00:15:27,208 --> 00:15:30,291
Honestly, I'm still
kind of afraid.

269
00:15:30,375 --> 00:15:32,250
But that fear has nothing
to do with the fact

270
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:36,375
that you aren't human.
It's because I lack resolve!

271
00:15:36,458 --> 00:15:38,083
When we met by that lake,

272
00:15:38,166 --> 00:15:40,333
I couldn't take my
eyes off of you.

273
00:15:40,416 --> 00:15:43,250
You looked so strong.
So confident.

274
00:15:43,333 --> 00:15:46,041
And when you were hurt, you
jumped right back in the fight,

275
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:48,791
and I found that beautiful.

276
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:50,500
I'd been moping around.

277
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,458
But during that time I
got to spend with you,

278
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:56,291
I felt like I could fly!

279
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:59,375
And you made me realize
that I never really cared about

280
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:01,333
riding in a FRANXX at all.

281
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,000

riding in one with you!

So please, don't
leave me! Zero Two!

If I'm with Zero Two,
I can do this!

Now, darling, let's fly!

I'm doing it! I'm piloting!

[ZERO TWO] That's right!
This is what you're capable of!

00:18:27,250 --> 00:18:31,250
This feeling, though, it's like
I'm deep inside of you.

00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:36,625
I can't tell where I end and
you begin. And yet, I love it!

I'm feeling it, too.

this all along?
