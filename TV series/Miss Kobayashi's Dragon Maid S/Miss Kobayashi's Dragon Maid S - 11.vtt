[COACH 211A] Make sure you
stretch out those side muscles.

00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.013 align:middle
We don't want any injuries.
Remember to breathe!

00:00:13.096 --> 00:00:16.182 align:middle
One and two, three.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:17.851 align:middle
--Good!

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.185 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI groans]

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.228 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hmm?

00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:21.563 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Not good.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.190 align:middle
Every day seems to push me
closer to geriatrics.

00:00:24.274 --> 00:00:26.818 align:middle
I need to figure something out
before I wind up bedridden

00:00:26.901 --> 00:00:29.487 align:middle
with Tohru in charge
of my entire wellbeing.

00:00:29.571 --> 00:00:30.488 align:middle
Get it out of here.

00:00:30.572 --> 00:00:31.489 align:middle
[gasps]

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:32.991 align:middle
[groans]

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.375 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Wow!

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:08.628 align:middle
I've never seen so many massage
devices in my entire life.

00:02:08.712 --> 00:02:10.797 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Cool. What's this one do?

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.882 align:middle
Ooh, how specific!

00:02:12.966 --> 00:02:15.010 align:middle
Uh. That one looks exciting.

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:16.302 align:middle
This might be good, as well.

00:02:16.386 --> 00:02:17.679 align:middle
Oh, look at that!
How many speeds?!

00:02:17.762 --> 00:02:19.848 align:middle
Is that a fish tail?
They're so magical!

00:02:19.931 --> 00:02:21.182 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi!

00:02:21.266 --> 00:02:22.642 align:middle
What are these devices?!

00:02:22.726 --> 00:02:23.977 align:middle
What are you going
to do with them?!

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.855 align:middle
Uh... Use them, obviously.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:28.356 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Are you sure about that?

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.234 align:middle
When was the last time you
used this pink obscenity, huh?

00:02:31.317 --> 00:02:32.694 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I will when I'm ready.

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:34.821 align:middle
[ILULU]
Want me to pound you?

00:02:34.904 --> 00:02:36.489 align:middle
My grandma used
to love to have me pound

00:02:36.573 --> 00:02:38.241 align:middle
on her shoulders like this.

00:02:38.324 --> 00:02:39.284 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
There's a grandma?

00:02:39.367 --> 00:02:41.244 align:middle
Does that feel good,
Miss Kobayashi?

00:02:41.327 --> 00:02:44.164 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] It's fine, I guess,
but can you remove your jugs?

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:46.332 align:middle
--Ah?
--Let me try.

00:02:46.416 --> 00:02:48.793 align:middle
Is this a thing now?

00:02:48.877 --> 00:02:50.754 align:middle
I wanna try that, too!

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:54.382 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi?

00:02:54.466 --> 00:02:57.052 align:middle
Something's on my mind that
I want to talk to you about.

00:02:57.135 --> 00:02:58.303 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:00.513 align:middle
I spend a lot of my time
thinking of all the ways

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:01.973 align:middle
I'd like to service you,

00:03:02.057 --> 00:03:04.851 align:middle
but I've realized I'm only
thinking about what I want.

00:03:04.934 --> 00:03:07.228 align:middle
In order to provide
the perfect service,

00:03:07.312 --> 00:03:10.357 align:middle
I need to focus on your feelings
and consider what it is

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.276 align:middle
you need most or what you
would like me to do for you.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.111 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Where are we going with this?

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:16.112 align:middle
[TOHRU]
So, here you go!

00:03:16.196 --> 00:03:17.197 align:middle
You know I'm not gonna eat that!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.782 align:middle
How is this focusing
on my feelings?!

00:03:18.865 --> 00:03:22.369 align:middle
Ah? I should've known your kind
heart would lead you to starve

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:24.913 align:middle
instead of piercing
my tail with your teeth.

00:03:24.996 --> 00:03:26.706 align:middle
What I wouldn't give
for you to finally accept

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:27.957 align:middle
the truth about that.

00:03:28.041 --> 00:03:30.919 align:middle
[TOHRU] Mm? Does this
mean we're in a fight?

00:03:31.002 --> 00:03:33.546 align:middle
Thank you for agreeing
to meet me.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.131 align:middle
I called you fools
here since you work

00:03:35.215 --> 00:03:36.883 align:middle
with Miss Kobayashi every day.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.678 align:middle
[BOTH] Maybe don't start off
by calling us "fools"?

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:41.971 align:middle
Her lower back's
hurting her again?

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:45.058 align:middle
Now that you mention it, she has
been working later than usual.

00:03:45.141 --> 00:03:47.477 align:middle
Our sales team is talented,
but we work harder.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.771 align:middle
This isn't about her job, guys!

00:03:49.854 --> 00:03:52.023 align:middle
Well, there is something
else I noticed.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:53.108 align:middle
Great! What is it?

00:03:53.191 --> 00:03:55.068 align:middle
She has really
bad posture in general.

00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.654 align:middle
What does that have to do
with her lower back hurting?

00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.948 align:middle
Ah, jeez. Lemme
break it down for you:

00:04:00.031 --> 00:04:01.324 align:middle
these humans
can strain their backs

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:02.992 align:middle
by hunching over
their keyboards.

00:04:03.076 --> 00:04:04.160 align:middle
They can?!

00:04:04.244 --> 00:04:06.162 align:middle
She should probably
buy a new chair.

00:04:06.246 --> 00:04:07.580 align:middle
What?

00:04:07.664 --> 00:04:09.374 align:middle
She's been using the same
old offensive office chair

00:04:09.457 --> 00:04:11.668 align:middle
for years now. I've
been saying it's about time

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.129 align:middle
for her to treat herself
to a fancy upgrade.

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:15.964 align:middle
She says she doesn't
want to pay for one.

00:04:16.047 --> 00:04:17.382 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Are they expensive?

00:04:17.465 --> 00:04:19.801 align:middle
Is Miss Kobayashi one of those
humans who buy multiples

00:04:19.884 --> 00:04:22.762 align:middle
of products because she thinks
it makes them cheaper?

00:04:22.846 --> 00:04:26.182 align:middle
Yep. She also buys well
liquor and nurses it all night.

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:29.477 align:middle
If she would eat my tail,
she wouldn't have any back pain.

00:04:29.561 --> 00:04:30.895 align:middle
Whatever.
[sighs]

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.731 align:middle
Yeah, but then
her stomach would hurt.

00:04:32.814 --> 00:04:34.524 align:middle
There is something I can get
from our world that could

00:04:34.607 --> 00:04:36.609 align:middle
help Miss Kobayashi
with her lower back!

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.653 align:middle
I'll have to go and find it.

00:04:38.737 --> 00:04:41.364 align:middle
That's, uh...
maybe not a good idea.

00:04:41.448 --> 00:04:42.907 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hmm?

00:04:42.991 --> 00:04:46.161 align:middle
Have you heard the story of
eating the flesh of the dead?

00:04:46.244 --> 00:04:48.663 align:middle
It's said if you boil the meat
in a pot while visiting

00:04:48.747 --> 00:04:51.416 align:middle
the underworld, you'll
become permanently trapped

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:53.335 align:middle
once you consume it.

00:04:53.418 --> 00:04:55.962 align:middle
You think I'm trying
to trap her in our world?

00:04:56.046 --> 00:04:59.883 align:middle
If you did, then Miss Kobayashi
would practically be Persephone.

00:04:59.966 --> 00:05:01.843 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
I don't know about Persephone.

00:05:01.926 --> 00:05:04.637 align:middle
She's more like
King Demophon, isn't she?

00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.140 align:middle
[sighs] Sometimes,
things just don't work out,

00:05:07.223 --> 00:05:09.726 align:middle
even when you know
what's for the best.

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:12.687 align:middle
I think I'm gonna go home
and revise my strategy a bit.

00:05:12.771 --> 00:05:14.606 align:middle
You got this,
Mister Takiya? Thanks!

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:16.274 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Uh?

00:05:16.358 --> 00:05:18.735 align:middle
[ELMA] I have to admit,
I'm impressed with your skills.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:21.613 align:middle
It can be hard to talk
sense into Tohru sometimes.

00:05:21.696 --> 00:05:24.783 align:middle
Can it? Well, it's just logic.

00:05:24.866 --> 00:05:28.286 align:middle
Whenever emotions are heightened
it can be easy to overstep.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.038 align:middle
I was just concerned.

00:05:31.915 --> 00:05:34.793 align:middle
Mister Takiya had a good point.

00:05:34.876 --> 00:05:38.296 align:middle
Honestly, that whole
thing hit me kinda hard.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.507 align:middle
I don't see what's wrong
with maximizing your power

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:43.218 align:middle
to make someone who's
precious to you happy.

00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:45.929 align:middle
Isn't that what it's for?

00:05:46.012 --> 00:05:47.639 align:middle
I've always thought so.

00:05:47.722 --> 00:05:49.516 align:middle
But if Miss Kobayashi
doesn't want my help,

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.936 align:middle
I guess I should mind
my own business.

00:05:53.019 --> 00:05:55.271 align:middle
I've been eating food from
this world without any concerns

00:05:55.355 --> 00:05:57.315 align:middle
about if I would
end up stuck here.

00:05:57.399 --> 00:05:59.859 align:middle
In fact, I think I'd be
fine with that.

00:05:59.943 --> 00:06:01.194 align:middle
But... I wouldn't want

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:04.155 align:middle
to take Miss Kobayashi
away from her world.

00:06:05.323 --> 00:06:06.658 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hello, I'm home!

00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:09.494 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh. Welcome back.

00:06:09.577 --> 00:06:12.497 align:middle
Oh, You decided to use that?

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.458 align:middle
Yeah. It actually
feels pretty amazing.

00:06:15.542 --> 00:06:16.626 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi?

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:17.877 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:20.463 align:middle
Uh! No means no, Tohru!

00:06:20.547 --> 00:06:22.173 align:middle
Calm down.

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:25.010 align:middle
Why don't you try resting
your back against it?

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:30.765 align:middle
[gasps]
Ah!

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:34.644 align:middle
Tohru, where have you
been all my life?! Wow!

00:06:34.728 --> 00:06:35.812 align:middle
[sighs]

00:06:35.895 --> 00:06:38.648 align:middle
Do you want me to
adjust anything for you?

00:06:38.732 --> 00:06:42.277 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm? No, this is perfectly fine.

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.362 align:middle
So is it everything you want?

00:06:44.446 --> 00:06:46.698 align:middle
I do believe we have a winner.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.036 align:middle
[TOHRU sighs]

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:54.330 align:middle
Well, that's easy enough.
Just relax.

00:06:54.414 --> 00:06:55.790 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI groans]

00:06:55.874 --> 00:06:59.002 align:middle
I actually feel a lot better!
Are we trading?

00:06:59.085 --> 00:07:00.378 align:middle
Do you want me
to massage you, now?

00:07:00.462 --> 00:07:02.422 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Oh, uh, sure.

00:07:02.505 --> 00:07:04.549 align:middle
Shoulders, please.

00:07:04.632 --> 00:07:05.550 align:middle
What?!

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:07.093 align:middle
Why are your
shoulders so tight?!

00:07:07.177 --> 00:07:09.179 align:middle
Is it because
your boobs are heavy?

00:07:15.143 --> 00:07:16.811 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
What are you writing?

00:07:16.895 --> 00:07:19.564 align:middle
It's a grimoire for
perception blocking and stuff.

00:07:19.647 --> 00:07:22.150 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Ah. I love convenient magic.

00:07:22.233 --> 00:07:23.735 align:middle
[TOHRU giggles]

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:28.031 align:middle
I was thinking of teaching Kanna
and Ilulu how to do it first.

00:07:28.114 --> 00:07:29.991 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] You're a good
friend to them, Tohru.

00:07:30.075 --> 00:07:33.286 align:middle
Oh! You don't need flattery
to have your way with me!

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:34.371 align:middle
Ugh!

00:07:34.454 --> 00:07:35.538 align:middle
[TOHRU] You're so cute
when you're shy,

00:07:35.622 --> 00:07:39.084 align:middle
but you really don't need to be!

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:40.543 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:07:46.883 --> 00:07:48.510 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I knew it...

00:07:49.844 --> 00:07:51.304 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Have you ever
noticed anything strange

00:07:51.388 --> 00:07:52.972 align:middle
about the lines of magic spells

00:07:53.056 --> 00:07:55.266 align:middle
and the lines of code
in programming?

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:57.185 align:middle
That they resemble each other?

00:07:57.268 --> 00:07:58.603 align:middle
Yeah.

00:07:58.687 --> 00:08:01.064 align:middle
[SHOUTA'S DAD] There's a simple
explanation for that.

00:08:01.147 --> 00:08:03.066 align:middle
It's because they were
originally conceptualized

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:05.193 align:middle
and developed by mages.

00:08:05.276 --> 00:08:08.530 align:middle
Huh? Wha-- Really?
I didn't know that!

00:08:08.613 --> 00:08:12.075 align:middle
Are you interested in learning
more about this side of things?

00:08:12.867 --> 00:08:15.412 align:middle
[SHOUTA'S DAD] If so, then
you're probably dying to know.

00:08:15.495 --> 00:08:17.080 align:middle
To know what?

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.498 align:middle
[SHOUTA'S DAD] You've been
wondering what it was

00:08:18.581 --> 00:08:20.875 align:middle
that brought Tohru to our
world in the first place,

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.168 align:middle
have you not?

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.671 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI growls]
I can ask Tohru about that!

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:25.922 align:middle
Would you like to know anything

00:08:26.006 --> 00:08:27.674 align:middle
about what her
family experienced?

00:08:27.757 --> 00:08:30.135 align:middle
[gasps]

00:08:30.218 --> 00:08:31.594 align:middle
Ah!

00:08:36.725 --> 00:08:38.977 align:middle
[groans]

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.770 align:middle
Is that Tohru's father?

00:08:40.854 --> 00:08:43.148 align:middle
Wow, it's been a while.

00:08:43.231 --> 00:08:45.567 align:middle
What are you doing here?

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:48.611 align:middle
[DEMISE] I'm visiting
my friend who's in charge.

00:08:48.695 --> 00:08:50.905 align:middle
He's been telling me
how Tohru's doing.

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.532 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Is that so?

00:08:52.615 --> 00:08:55.285 align:middle
[DEMISE]
I assume if you've come here,

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:57.829 align:middle
that you have something
to ask me, right?

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.539 align:middle
Yes, that's true.

00:08:59.622 --> 00:09:02.167 align:middle
But, um, just know that
I'll also be asking Tohru

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:05.086 align:middle
for her perspective.

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:08.381 align:middle
[DEMISE]
Hmm...

00:09:08.465 --> 00:09:10.383 align:middle
Very well.

00:09:13.928 --> 00:09:16.473 align:middle
[DEMISE] It felt as though
we would never find peace.

00:09:16.556 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle
We did little more than prepare
for battles by gathering forces,

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle
then clashing against them,
and wearing ourselves out.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:26.858 align:middle
The reason we fought
was to defeat the gods

00:09:26.941 --> 00:09:29.694 align:middle
and restore the world to
a state that was free

00:09:29.778 --> 00:09:32.072 align:middle
of any imposters.

00:09:32.155 --> 00:09:34.699 align:middle
We bared our fangs
because we hated the thought

00:09:34.783 --> 00:09:36.368 align:middle
of being controlled,

00:09:36.451 --> 00:09:41.164 align:middle
and we tried desperately
to take back our freedom.

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.458 align:middle
At first, this turmoil
is what unified

00:09:43.541 --> 00:09:45.085 align:middle
all of the dragons,

00:09:45.168 --> 00:09:48.421 align:middle
but as time drew on,
some changed sides and supported

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle
the efforts of the gods.

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.509 align:middle
There were others
who grew sick of the fighting

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:56.012 align:middle
and refused to lend
their aid to either side.

00:09:56.096 --> 00:10:00.141 align:middle
We now refer to the first group
as the Harmony Faction.

00:10:00.225 --> 00:10:02.769 align:middle
The others are
the Spectator Faction,

00:10:02.852 --> 00:10:05.939 align:middle
and, because we were neither,
we came to be known

00:10:06.022 --> 00:10:08.942 align:middle
as the Chaos Faction.

00:10:09.025 --> 00:10:13.780 align:middle
We are the ones who would
plunge the world into chaos.

00:10:13.863 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle
Our strategy was to fight
for several centuries,

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:20.245 align:middle
then wait for several
more to build up our strength.

00:10:20.328 --> 00:10:23.665 align:middle
While all of that was
happening, I had a child.

00:10:23.748 --> 00:10:26.418 align:middle
Her name was Tohru.

00:10:27.627 --> 00:10:31.673 align:middle
She was named after
an author from this world.

00:10:31.756 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle
I'm sorry, I dissociated.
What'd you say?

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:37.554 align:middle
Something about Tohru
being named for a human?

00:10:37.637 --> 00:10:39.222 align:middle
[DEMISE]
That's correct.

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:41.433 align:middle
This man was here for it all.

00:10:41.516 --> 00:10:43.768 align:middle
He used clairvoyance
to read that book

00:10:43.852 --> 00:10:45.770 align:middle
and write down the text.

00:10:45.854 --> 00:10:49.357 align:middle
He then sold numerous copies
of it across our world.

00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.277 align:middle
It's called "plagiarism,"
I think.

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.362 align:middle
[SHOUTA's DAD] The copyright of
an author's works disappears

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:56.406 align:middle
a while after
their death, right?

00:10:56.489 --> 00:10:59.367 align:middle
So there's no harm in
selling it in another world.

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:02.829 align:middle
And well before the book
is even conceptualized,

00:11:02.912 --> 00:11:05.623 align:middle
I can't live without
funds for my research!

00:11:05.707 --> 00:11:08.460 align:middle
Seriously?

00:11:08.543 --> 00:11:10.128 align:middle
[DEMISE]
Humans...

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle
At the time, I just
couldn't regard them

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.341 align:middle
with any level of importance.

00:11:14.424 --> 00:11:17.260 align:middle
Occasionally, they'll
create amusing knickknacks

00:11:17.344 --> 00:11:19.763 align:middle
or design something
entertaining.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:23.266 align:middle
But that's all I thought
they were good for.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.728 align:middle
There were some among the
group who worshiped the gods,

00:11:26.811 --> 00:11:29.856 align:middle
even though they were
nothing compared to the dragons

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:31.733 align:middle
they fought against.

00:11:32.817 --> 00:11:35.820 align:middle
[DEMISE] That's why I ignored
them as long as I could,

00:11:35.904 --> 00:11:38.448 align:middle
but it became a different
story when those humans

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:41.576 align:middle
joined forces with
the Harmony Faction.

00:11:41.659 --> 00:11:44.287 align:middle
So those in the Chaos
Faction began spreading

00:11:44.371 --> 00:11:47.290 align:middle
the rumor humans
were pure evil--

00:11:47.374 --> 00:11:50.085 align:middle
that we were honor-bound
to destroy.

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.753 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Papa! Papa!

00:11:51.836 --> 00:11:54.506 align:middle
What kind of
creatures are humans?

00:11:55.924 --> 00:11:58.009 align:middle
[DEMISE]
They're nothing but evil.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle
They should be destroyed.

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.972 align:middle
[DEMISE] I thought I had to go
along with the faction or else

00:12:03.056 --> 00:12:05.600 align:middle
my Tohru would be persecuted.

00:12:06.810 --> 00:12:07.977 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I'm gonna kill you, rock!

00:12:08.061 --> 00:12:09.854 align:middle
[DEMISE] Tohru was born
into the rigid structure

00:12:09.938 --> 00:12:13.775 align:middle
of dragon society with
no hope for reform in sight,

00:12:13.858 --> 00:12:16.528 align:middle
and I believed that I had
burdened her with a life

00:12:16.611 --> 00:12:18.071 align:middle
of being my daughter.

00:12:18.154 --> 00:12:20.031 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Time to die!

00:12:20.824 --> 00:12:23.660 align:middle
[DEMISE] Perhaps I believed that
she was doomed as a member

00:12:23.743 --> 00:12:27.539 align:middle
of my bloodline because of
how negative the humans were.

00:12:29.499 --> 00:12:34.254 align:middle
[DEMISE] I decided to grant
Tohru free will over her life.

00:12:34.337 --> 00:12:36.506 align:middle
I wanted her
to visit many places,

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.925 align:middle
interact with
a myriad of beings,

00:12:39.009 --> 00:12:41.469 align:middle
and develop her own ideas.

00:12:41.553 --> 00:12:43.722 align:middle
Everything Tohru has
learned stemmed from

00:12:43.805 --> 00:12:47.100 align:middle
an interest curated
without bias.

00:12:47.183 --> 00:12:49.144 align:middle
I thought she would
eventually come to question

00:12:49.227 --> 00:12:50.770 align:middle
the Chaos Faction.

00:12:50.854 --> 00:12:54.065 align:middle
Perhaps even challenge
their contempt for humans.

00:12:54.149 --> 00:12:57.527 align:middle
But... she's completely
out of control.

00:12:57.610 --> 00:12:58.987 align:middle
What makes you say that?

00:12:59.070 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle
[DEMISE]
Well, for one...

00:13:00.613 --> 00:13:03.950 align:middle
She stormed the gods'
camp all by herself.

00:13:05.285 --> 00:13:08.204 align:middle
[DEMISE] It was there that she
was wounded, and then, somehow,

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:10.582 align:middle
she was able to escape
into this world.

00:13:10.665 --> 00:13:13.835 align:middle
That's when I
found her in the mountains.

00:13:13.918 --> 00:13:15.545 align:middle
[DEMISE]
That's correct.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.839 align:middle
It was quite a surprise.

00:13:17.922 --> 00:13:20.091 align:middle
I never imagined such
a strong bond could form

00:13:20.175 --> 00:13:22.135 align:middle
between a human and a dragon.

00:13:22.218 --> 00:13:25.680 align:middle
It was fascinating
to see for the first time.

00:13:25.764 --> 00:13:28.767 align:middle
So then, why did
Tohru take that risk?

00:13:30.018 --> 00:13:31.436 align:middle
[DEMISE]
Her heart.

00:13:31.519 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle
More than anyone else, Tohru
wanted to end the fighting.

00:13:37.025 --> 00:13:39.027 align:middle
[DEMISE]
If she could crush the gods,

00:13:39.110 --> 00:13:40.820 align:middle
then the fighting would end.

00:13:40.904 --> 00:13:43.698 align:middle
That must've been
what she thought.

00:13:47.243 --> 00:13:49.037 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Damn!

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:50.997 align:middle
This is intense...

00:13:52.165 --> 00:13:54.751 align:middle
[DEMISE] So now you have
the general overview.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:56.461 align:middle
You'll have to ask Tohru
if you want to know

00:13:56.544 --> 00:13:59.172 align:middle
her feelings in detail.

00:13:59.255 --> 00:14:01.633 align:middle
Could you tell me
one more thing?

00:14:01.716 --> 00:14:02.926 align:middle
[DEMISE]
I can try.

00:14:03.009 --> 00:14:05.053 align:middle
It's about when
I first met Tohru.

00:14:05.136 --> 00:14:08.723 align:middle
She had mentioned to me that
she'd been recently abandoned.

00:14:08.807 --> 00:14:11.434 align:middle
What do you think
she meant by that?

00:14:11.518 --> 00:14:13.687 align:middle
[DEMISE]
"Abandoned"?

00:14:13.770 --> 00:14:15.063 align:middle
Let me think...

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:17.691 align:middle
I can hardly surmise
Tohru's feelings,

00:14:17.774 --> 00:14:19.859 align:middle
but I'm sure from your
human perspective,

00:14:19.943 --> 00:14:21.945 align:middle
it sounds like I'm a bad father.

00:14:22.028 --> 00:14:24.447 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Actually,
you're one of the better ones.

00:14:24.531 --> 00:14:28.284 align:middle
[DEMISE] Tohru was not forced
into battle by any faction.

00:14:28.368 --> 00:14:33.623 align:middle
Believe me. She fought
completely of her own volition.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:38.795 align:middle
Just as every single dragon did
when this first started.

00:14:38.878 --> 00:14:42.132 align:middle
[DEMISE]
Well. I should be going.

00:14:44.217 --> 00:14:45.719 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:14:45.802 --> 00:14:51.266 align:middle
[DEMISE] But I want you to know
I will never approve of you two.

00:14:51.349 --> 00:14:55.645 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI gasps]
Uh, yes, sir.

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:58.356 align:middle
It may be hard to believe
in light of current events,

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.984 align:middle
but he's made several
arrangements with god for her.

00:15:01.067 --> 00:15:02.902 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Wow.

00:15:02.986 --> 00:15:04.738 align:middle
[DEMISE]
One more thing.

00:15:04.821 --> 00:15:08.241 align:middle
Take proper care of her
until your lifespan runs out.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:12.287 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I'll watch over her, I promise.

00:15:38.605 --> 00:15:39.898 align:middle
I'm home.

00:15:39.981 --> 00:15:43.234 align:middle
Welcome back!
How was your day today?

00:15:43.318 --> 00:15:45.987 align:middle
Your dad showed up
at my office, Tohru.

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:47.489 align:middle
[gasps]

00:15:47.572 --> 00:15:51.409 align:middle
He told me all about what
happened before you came here.

00:15:51.493 --> 00:15:55.914 align:middle
So I was hoping to hear it
from your perspective.

00:15:55.997 --> 00:15:59.709 align:middle
What inspired you to move
so far away from your own world?

00:15:59.793 --> 00:16:01.920 align:middle
I'd appreciate it
if you told me yourself.

00:16:02.003 --> 00:16:04.422 align:middle
You know, whenever
you feel like talking.

00:16:09.135 --> 00:16:12.305 align:middle
It's cool, you don't
have to force yourself.

00:16:12.389 --> 00:16:13.515 align:middle
If you don't want
to talk about it,

00:16:13.598 --> 00:16:16.726 align:middle
I totally understand, promise.

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:22.315 align:middle
Do you want to know?

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:23.775 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm.

00:16:24.734 --> 00:16:27.153 align:middle
[TOHRU] There's magic
to look like a human?

00:16:30.407 --> 00:16:32.909 align:middle
[DRAGON 211A]
You did it on the first try?

00:16:32.992 --> 00:16:34.869 align:middle
You really are
a genius, aren't you?

00:16:34.953 --> 00:16:36.454 align:middle
Good job!

00:16:36.538 --> 00:16:38.748 align:middle
Your father said he wants you
to go to "all sorts of places,"

00:16:38.832 --> 00:16:40.959 align:middle
wherever that may be.

00:16:41.042 --> 00:16:44.379 align:middle
[laughs] I wonder, does
the Emperor of Demise

00:16:44.462 --> 00:16:47.215 align:middle
want his daughter
to become a Spectator?

00:16:49.426 --> 00:16:52.887 align:middle
[TOHRU] That was that.
The day I started my journey.

00:16:56.224 --> 00:16:58.476 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Humans were everywhere I went.

00:17:00.729 --> 00:17:02.689 align:middle
[TOHRU]
People are so foolish.

00:17:02.772 --> 00:17:05.108 align:middle
They're fighting today, as well.

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:09.404 align:middle
It's a constant battle over
things like land or authority.

00:17:09.487 --> 00:17:12.532 align:middle
But they also create
a bunch of interesting things.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:17.120 align:middle
[TOHRU] That was my first
impression, well, as a dragon.

00:17:19.748 --> 00:17:21.082 align:middle
Wady Toe-wu.

00:17:21.166 --> 00:17:22.375 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I'm Tohru.

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:24.210 align:middle
Tohu?

00:17:24.294 --> 00:17:25.920 align:middle
Close enough.

00:17:26.004 --> 00:17:28.048 align:middle
Your name's Kanna, isn't it?

00:17:28.131 --> 00:17:31.343 align:middle
You used magic to become
a human, too. Why?

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:35.263 align:middle
There aw wots of exciting
things to do with human hands.

00:17:35.347 --> 00:17:37.349 align:middle
I like pranks.

00:17:37.432 --> 00:17:42.479 align:middle
[TOHRU] Mm. Is that
the previous Kanna Kamui?

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:44.606 align:middle
What kind of pranks?

00:17:44.689 --> 00:17:46.483 align:middle
Cowwecting bugs and stuff!

00:17:46.566 --> 00:17:48.610 align:middle
That's not a real prank.

00:17:48.693 --> 00:17:49.694 align:middle
Uh.

00:17:49.778 --> 00:17:53.031 align:middle
[KANNA whimpers]

00:17:53.114 --> 00:17:54.783 align:middle
I want attention from you.

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:56.326 align:middle
[TOHRU sighs]

00:17:57.952 --> 00:17:59.537 align:middle
[TOHRU] They probably
didn't have time for you

00:17:59.621 --> 00:18:02.332 align:middle
while they were
preparing for battle.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:07.462 align:middle
They usually only clash once
every few centuries, if at all.

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:09.923 align:middle
[LUCOA]
I'm not interested in fighting.

00:18:10.006 --> 00:18:12.717 align:middle
[TOHRU] Because you're
a coward, Quetzalcoatl.

00:18:12.801 --> 00:18:15.720 align:middle
You're strong, but refuse
to participate in battles.

00:18:15.804 --> 00:18:19.015 align:middle
[LUCOA] I don't like to fight--
what do you want from me?

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:22.185 align:middle
Looking in from the outside,
it's so pointless.

00:18:22.268 --> 00:18:26.022 align:middle
Tohru, love, you should
quit the Chaos Faction.

00:18:29.025 --> 00:18:31.569 align:middle
[TOHRU] I'm the daughter of
the Emperor of Demise,

00:18:31.653 --> 00:18:34.239 align:middle
the representative
of the Chaos Faction.

00:18:34.322 --> 00:18:36.366 align:middle
If I were to run,
then my father's position

00:18:36.449 --> 00:18:38.326 align:middle
would be in jeopardy.

00:18:38.410 --> 00:18:39.994 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Absurd.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.288 align:middle
If you can't live your life
the way you want,

00:18:42.372 --> 00:18:44.207 align:middle
then you fail as a dragon!

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.584 align:middle
The fact that you were
put in that position by others

00:18:46.668 --> 00:18:48.211 align:middle
must be aggravating.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.046 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Is that how it works?

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:54.134 align:middle
[FAFNIR] You may be a dragon,
but you live too selflessly.

00:18:54.217 --> 00:18:58.054 align:middle
If anyone stands in the way
of what you want, kill them.

00:18:58.138 --> 00:19:00.223 align:middle
Even if they're your parents.

00:19:00.306 --> 00:19:02.308 align:middle
That's what dragons do.

00:19:02.392 --> 00:19:04.227 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Pretty extreme...

00:19:04.310 --> 00:19:05.645 align:middle
[TOHRU panting]

00:19:05.729 --> 00:19:08.189 align:middle
[ELMA panting]

00:19:09.899 --> 00:19:11.943 align:middle
[ELMA]
Tohru...

00:19:12.027 --> 00:19:15.864 align:middle
I can't continue on
this journey with you.

00:19:15.947 --> 00:19:17.490 align:middle
We have to end it.

00:19:17.574 --> 00:19:18.867 align:middle
Right.

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:21.369 align:middle
No hard feelings.

00:19:21.453 --> 00:19:24.497 align:middle
You do make a good point
and I understand what you mean.

00:19:24.581 --> 00:19:28.126 align:middle
I guess it's possible that
I've been used by others, too.

00:19:28.209 --> 00:19:31.880 align:middle
[ELMA] I don't agree, of course,
I'm not a complete fool.

00:19:31.963 --> 00:19:34.049 align:middle
Prayers are precious resources,

00:19:34.132 --> 00:19:37.594 align:middle
which is why I think it felt
good to focus on helping humans.

00:19:37.677 --> 00:19:39.471 align:middle
You got to eat your fill, too.

00:19:39.554 --> 00:19:41.097 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:19:42.682 --> 00:19:43.850 align:middle
[ELMA]
Thank you, Tohru.

00:19:43.933 --> 00:19:45.894 align:middle
I had such fun with you.

00:19:45.977 --> 00:19:49.064 align:middle
I'm glad it was your decision
to travel with me.

00:19:49.147 --> 00:19:50.982 align:middle
I'll never forget.

00:19:57.155 --> 00:20:00.575 align:middle
[TOHRU] But it wasn't,
I couldn't choose anything.

00:20:01.534 --> 00:20:06.498 align:middle
[TOHRU] I just... didn't like
it, the lack of freedom.

00:20:06.581 --> 00:20:09.042 align:middle
I didn't want the Chaos
Faction and Harmony Faction

00:20:09.125 --> 00:20:10.919 align:middle
to fight each other.

00:20:11.002 --> 00:20:13.254 align:middle
That was never my will.

00:20:13.338 --> 00:20:17.467 align:middle
It felt good having a friend
so close that we could spar.

00:20:17.550 --> 00:20:20.637 align:middle
I respect my Father,
but the chains of being

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:24.933 align:middle
the Emperor of Demise's
daughter are way too heavy.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:27.268 align:middle
I want to live freely.

00:20:27.352 --> 00:20:29.479 align:middle
I want to be on my own.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:30.980 align:middle
I am a dragon.

00:20:31.064 --> 00:20:34.484 align:middle
So I'll fight and win
my independence.

00:20:34.567 --> 00:20:36.444 align:middle
The factions don't matter.

00:20:36.528 --> 00:20:38.571 align:middle
This is my personal fight!

00:20:38.655 --> 00:20:41.199 align:middle
I'm going to wipe these guys
out and break all the chains

00:20:41.282 --> 00:20:43.201 align:middle
clinging to dragons!

00:20:43.284 --> 00:20:44.577 align:middle
I'm going to be free!

00:20:44.661 --> 00:20:47.330 align:middle
And then... And then...!

00:20:53.628 --> 00:20:56.089 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I didn't have anything.

00:20:56.172 --> 00:21:00.760 align:middle
Once I was alone, I found there
was nothing I wanted to do.

00:21:01.803 --> 00:21:07.934 align:middle
[TOHRU] Being on my own,
being free, was so terrifying.

00:21:17.610 --> 00:21:19.446 align:middle
That's how I remember it.

00:21:19.529 --> 00:21:23.283 align:middle
I was afraid to be free until
you showed up and took my hand.

00:21:23.366 --> 00:21:25.910 align:middle
You made me feel like
I wasn't alone.

00:21:27.328 --> 00:21:30.248 align:middle
Uh, cool. I was never
interested in anything

00:21:30.331 --> 00:21:33.043 align:middle
until after I moved
to the big city.

00:21:33.126 --> 00:21:34.878 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I know who I am now.

00:21:34.961 --> 00:21:36.171 align:middle
What?

00:21:37.756 --> 00:21:39.841 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi...

00:21:41.509 --> 00:21:44.929 align:middle
I see that I've always
wanted to be a maid!

00:21:46.890 --> 00:21:48.933 align:middle
[TOHRU giggles]

00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:30.368 align:middle
[TOHRU] Miss Kobayashi, I heard
they'll be launching fireworks

00:23:30.452 --> 00:23:31.494 align:middle
at the summer festival.

00:23:31.578 --> 00:23:32.912 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah, that's true.

00:23:32.996 --> 00:23:34.664 align:middle
[TOHRU] I think my breath would
be more amazing, though.

00:23:34.748 --> 00:23:36.541 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] That might turn it
into a blood festival.

00:23:36.624 --> 00:23:38.209 align:middle
[TOHRU] But the sights
you see on the verge of death

00:23:38.293 --> 00:23:39.461 align:middle
are so beautiful.

00:23:39.544 --> 00:23:41.504 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Why are we talking about this?!

00:23:43.006 --> 00:23:45.592 align:middle
[CAST]
This Week on "Who's Rotten?"

00:23:45.675 --> 00:23:46.676 align:middle
