00:00:08.591 --> 00:00:11.761 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] It all started with
a single statement from Elma.

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:14.764 align:middle
I demand improved
working conditions!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:15.765 align:middle
[OFFICE chatter]

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:17.934 align:middle
What's this about?
Are you hangry?

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.854 align:middle
This company wants too much
overtime and you know it!

00:00:20.937 --> 00:00:22.480 align:middle
The workload required of each
individual is absolutely...

00:00:22.564 --> 00:00:25.275 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] It's not that Elma's
demands were unjustified.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:27.777 align:middle
We just didn't have a say
in our scheduling.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.238 align:middle
Plus, our company's already
made some solid improvements

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:32.699 align:middle
since its founding.
It took some time,

00:00:32.782 --> 00:00:35.201 align:middle
but the working
conditions have improved.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:37.078 align:middle
And compared to
how things used to be,

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:39.789 align:middle
the amount of work seems
like a fair exchange.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:42.042 align:middle
I tried to explain
this to her, but...

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:44.544 align:middle
[ELMA] You can't just give up
and accept this abuse!

00:00:44.627 --> 00:00:46.338 align:middle
I refuse to give in!

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:49.632 align:middle
I'm gonna fight for our freedom!

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:51.926 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Surrounded by those
of us who had grown accustomed

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.096 align:middle
to exploitative labor and living
out our days aimlessly,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.932 align:middle
Elma took a stand
all by herself.

00:00:58.016 --> 00:00:59.100 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Good luck.

00:02:29.024 --> 00:02:30.775 align:middle
[OFFICE chatter]

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.361 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Two days later, Elma
used the few moments she had

00:02:33.445 --> 00:02:35.321 align:middle
in between assignments
to create a proposal

00:02:35.405 --> 00:02:37.782 align:middle
for improved working conditions.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:42.620 align:middle
I was once again astonished
by how capable dragons could be.

00:02:42.704 --> 00:02:44.164 align:middle
However...

00:02:44.247 --> 00:02:45.290 align:middle
[laughs]

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:46.750 align:middle
You're laughing at me?!

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:49.461 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
You wanna expand personnel?

00:02:49.544 --> 00:02:51.004 align:middle
[ELMA]
Yes!

00:02:51.087 --> 00:02:52.422 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] We're currently
doing mid-career recruitment,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:54.007 align:middle
and there's not
a single applicant.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.508 align:middle
[ELMA]
Why's that?

00:02:55.592 --> 00:02:57.010 align:middle
Because of the programming
language we're expected to use

00:02:57.093 --> 00:02:59.346 align:middle
at this company.

00:02:59.429 --> 00:03:01.222 align:middle
Even if we hired new grads,
they'd still need

00:03:01.306 --> 00:03:02.307 align:middle
a training period.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.975 align:middle
But they'd catch up
quickly, right?

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:06.227 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Not everyone is like you.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:07.479 align:middle
Here you go.

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:09.647 align:middle
Try again--taking
all that into account.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:13.068 align:middle
I finished the revisions!

00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:15.320 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
That was fast!

00:03:15.403 --> 00:03:16.946 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I was surprised by her speed,

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.491 align:middle
but it was the content
that really left me shocked.

00:03:19.574 --> 00:03:21.534 align:middle
The rough spots had
been completely revised--

00:03:21.618 --> 00:03:24.037 align:middle
none of the sections
had any contradictions,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.790 align:middle
and the text was
organized perfectly.

00:03:26.873 --> 00:03:27.791 align:middle
This is great!

00:03:27.874 --> 00:03:29.250 align:middle
You mean that?!

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:30.835 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Submit it to
our department head right away!

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:32.087 align:middle
I'm on it!

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.338 align:middle
[giggles]

00:03:34.631 --> 00:03:36.466 align:middle
It's a no-go.

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.592 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
He gave her some babble about

00:03:37.676 --> 00:03:39.886 align:middle
the company's income
and expenditures--

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.846 align:middle
things programmers
don't even deal with--

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.973 align:middle
and she couldn't fight back.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:45.809 align:middle
I could tell she was
getting emotional about it,

00:03:45.892 --> 00:03:48.603 align:middle
so I hit her with one of these:

00:03:48.687 --> 00:03:50.647 align:middle
[ELMA]
Dammit...

00:03:52.315 --> 00:03:54.526 align:middle
[ELMA]
I revised it again!

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:56.945 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] There's
something wrong with you!

00:03:57.028 --> 00:03:59.239 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] We were all
overwhelmed by Elma's intensity

00:03:59.322 --> 00:04:02.450 align:middle
as we began reading
through the latest draft.

00:04:02.534 --> 00:04:05.912 align:middle
It was epic. She had listed
every individual's schedule

00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:09.165 align:middle
in detail--including bathroom
breaks, mid-day fatigue,

00:04:09.249 --> 00:04:11.543 align:middle
time away from work spaces,
and even the amount of time

00:04:11.626 --> 00:04:13.545 align:middle
resting their heads
on their elbows

00:04:13.628 --> 00:04:15.171 align:middle
or recrossing their legs.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:17.966 align:middle
It was laid out like a curse
disguised as a proposal

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:19.634 align:middle
to improve efficiency.

00:04:19.718 --> 00:04:22.178 align:middle
It was a testament to our
complete lack of privacy

00:04:22.262 --> 00:04:24.472 align:middle
that many employees felt it
would've been more humane

00:04:24.556 --> 00:04:26.683 align:middle
for our boss to publish
nude photos of them

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:30.061 align:middle
on the company website
without their permission.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:32.355 align:middle
How did she get
all this information?

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:33.690 align:middle
According to her...

00:04:33.773 --> 00:04:35.692 align:middle
I used my clairvoyance.

00:04:35.775 --> 00:04:39.320 align:middle
I made my vision a
thousand-screen multi-display.

00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:42.782 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Even her analogies
were being influenced by work.

00:04:42.866 --> 00:04:45.702 align:middle
She triumphantly headed
to submit her proposal again.

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:49.164 align:middle
Shocking content aside, it was
thorough and convincing enough

00:04:49.247 --> 00:04:51.791 align:middle
to serve in negotiations.

00:04:51.875 --> 00:04:55.045 align:middle
Maybe Half-Day Fridays
could be more than just a dream.

00:04:56.254 --> 00:04:57.756 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Still...

00:04:57.839 --> 00:04:59.549 align:middle
It could be trauma bonding, but
I don't know how I'll be able

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:02.344 align:middle
to relax if I don't work
at least eight hours.

00:05:02.427 --> 00:05:05.013 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
That's... sad.

00:05:05.096 --> 00:05:09.142 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] However, the dream
was only alive for a short time.

00:05:09.225 --> 00:05:11.311 align:middle
All three of us were surprised
when we were summoned

00:05:11.394 --> 00:05:13.605 align:middle
by the executive director.

00:05:13.688 --> 00:05:16.483 align:middle
He wasn't gonna
fire us was he?

00:05:16.566 --> 00:05:18.943 align:middle
We headed to his office
with anxiety on our faces

00:05:19.027 --> 00:05:21.196 align:middle
and terror in our hearts.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.156 align:middle
[knocking]

00:05:23.239 --> 00:05:24.532 align:middle
[EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR]
Come in.

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:26.284 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
It's us.

00:05:28.244 --> 00:05:29.746 align:middle
Hey!

00:05:29.829 --> 00:05:32.665 align:middle
I hear you've been
very kind to Shouta.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.376 align:middle
Oh, no.

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:36.461 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
That's Shouta-baby's father.

00:05:36.544 --> 00:05:38.380 align:middle
Isn't he a mage or something?

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:41.675 align:middle
[ELMA] Did you have a look at
the improvement proposal?

00:05:41.758 --> 00:05:44.511 align:middle
Yes. You did a very
good job on it overall.

00:05:44.594 --> 00:05:46.346 align:middle
Joui Elma, right?

00:05:46.429 --> 00:05:48.264 align:middle
Forgive me.

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.600 align:middle
Would you prefer
"Priestess of the Holy Seas"?

00:05:50.684 --> 00:05:53.269 align:middle
--Uh?
--[gasps]

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:56.439 align:middle
I'm currently an employee here,
so whichever you prefer.

00:05:56.523 --> 00:05:57.774 align:middle
[SHOUTA'S DAD]
Mm-hmm.

00:05:57.857 --> 00:05:59.651 align:middle
Would you mind telling us
what this is all about?

00:05:59.734 --> 00:06:02.362 align:middle
Honestly, it's about the
goddess Shouta summoned.

00:06:02.445 --> 00:06:04.614 align:middle
See... I figured if
you are her friends,

00:06:04.698 --> 00:06:06.616 align:middle
then I should be
familiar with you, too.

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:09.327 align:middle
I bet she's ruining your son's
education, isn't she?

00:06:09.411 --> 00:06:10.787 align:middle
What a perv.

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.039 align:middle
She's also an ex-goddess.

00:06:13.123 --> 00:06:15.375 align:middle
We have a rule in our family
that we take responsibility

00:06:15.458 --> 00:06:18.878 align:middle
for our summons.
And contrary to your belief,

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:22.841 align:middle
I think the lady is good for
Shouta's education in many ways.

00:06:22.924 --> 00:06:25.218 align:middle
Be sure to thank her when he
develops a fetish for older,

00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:27.971 align:middle
questionable women.

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:29.305 align:middle
[SHOUTA'S DAD]
All right.

00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:31.766 align:middle
My friends, I think now
would be a good time

00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:34.185 align:middle
to discuss business, yes?

00:06:35.854 --> 00:06:38.398 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] That sucks.
I was hoping he'd go for it.

00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.859 align:middle
[TAKIYA chuckles]
People would complain if he did.

00:06:40.942 --> 00:06:43.528 align:middle
It wouldn't be fair for only
our department to improve.

00:06:43.611 --> 00:06:45.572 align:middle
He at least got
that portion right.

00:06:45.655 --> 00:06:46.948 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Hey, I'm just
glad he took the time

00:06:47.032 --> 00:06:48.700 align:middle
to look it over.

00:06:48.783 --> 00:06:51.036 align:middle
I've noticed we've been getting
out on time more frequently,

00:06:51.119 --> 00:06:53.121 align:middle
so obviously he's
taking some of it--

00:06:53.204 --> 00:06:54.831 align:middle
[ELMA] That doesn't matter!
It's not enough!

00:06:54.914 --> 00:06:56.166 align:middle
This company is
an ethical nightmare,

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:58.376 align:middle
and it's up to us
to turn it around!

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:59.961 align:middle
Did that come out of you?

00:07:00.045 --> 00:07:02.255 align:middle
As you clutch your bag of
hush-money-chocolates?

00:07:02.339 --> 00:07:03.882 align:middle
[ELMA whines]
That is that, and this is this!

00:07:03.965 --> 00:07:05.216 align:middle
Chocolates are low in sugar!

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.302 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
That doesn't make any sense.

00:07:09.012 --> 00:07:10.930 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Even after accepting his bribe,

00:07:11.014 --> 00:07:13.516 align:middle
Elma refused to give up.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.311 align:middle
She tried to start
a labor union on site.

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.730 align:middle
She created a safe space
for employee discussion

00:07:18.813 --> 00:07:22.901 align:middle
and continued to advocate
for better working conditions.

00:07:22.984 --> 00:07:27.155 align:middle
What surprised me most was that
Tohru was helping her with that.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:28.740 align:middle
I think it's a great plan!

00:07:28.823 --> 00:07:31.326 align:middle
And if it works out, you'll be
able to come home to me earlier!

00:07:31.409 --> 00:07:32.827 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
It all makes sense now.

00:07:32.911 --> 00:07:35.288 align:middle
And if it doesn't work out,
she'll burn...

00:07:35.372 --> 00:07:37.624 align:middle
Heh. Back at you.

00:07:37.707 --> 00:07:40.418 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Seeing rival forces
cooperating for mutual benefit

00:07:40.502 --> 00:07:42.879 align:middle
gave me hope that
maybe it could work.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:45.882 align:middle
However, our executive
director was crafty!

00:07:45.965 --> 00:07:48.677 align:middle
He used both logic and
delusions in perfect ratios

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.637 align:middle
to sidestep every claim.

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:54.391 align:middle
[ELMA sobbing]

00:07:54.474 --> 00:07:55.392 align:middle
Damn it...!

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:57.602 align:middle
This is so... unfair...!

00:07:57.686 --> 00:07:58.603 align:middle
[sobs]

00:07:58.687 --> 00:07:59.938 align:middle
Elma, are you--

00:08:00.021 --> 00:08:02.065 align:middle
No! I'm not okay!
I shouldn't have to work so late

00:08:02.148 --> 00:08:04.275 align:middle
and always miss
the limited sweets!

00:08:04.359 --> 00:08:06.361 align:middle
That's what this is about?

00:08:12.075 --> 00:08:13.827 align:middle
[ELMA] I finally finished work
in enough time to experience

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:17.330 align:middle
those limited-time flavors!
It's a miracle!

00:08:17.414 --> 00:08:18.540 align:middle
[CUSTOMER 209A]
Three of those, please!

00:08:18.623 --> 00:08:19.708 align:middle
[ELMA]
Three of them?!

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:20.917 align:middle
[CUSTOMER 209B]
Two, please!

00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:22.585 align:middle
[ELMA whimpering]

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:23.586 align:middle
[CUSTOMER 209C]
I'll have two.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.840 align:middle
[ELMA whining]

00:08:28.049 --> 00:08:30.051 align:middle
Uh, actually, just one's cool.

00:08:30.135 --> 00:08:33.304 align:middle
[gasps]
Thank you, beautiful human!

00:08:34.389 --> 00:08:38.184 align:middle
[ELMA humming]
Best day off ever!

00:08:38.268 --> 00:08:40.687 align:middle
I'll be doing nothing
but eating delicious sweets!

[doorbell rings]

00:08:41.771 --> 00:08:43.106 align:middle
[ELMA]
Huh?

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:44.232 align:middle
Hello?

00:08:44.315 --> 00:08:46.109 align:middle
Gah! What are you doing here?!

00:08:46.192 --> 00:08:48.153 align:middle
We wanted to go on a picnic.

00:08:48.236 --> 00:08:50.321 align:middle
But we're not allowed
to go far alone.

00:08:50.405 --> 00:08:51.823 align:middle
We need an adult.

00:08:51.906 --> 00:08:54.034 align:middle
Where's Miss Kobayashi?
Oh, that's right.

00:08:54.117 --> 00:08:56.411 align:middle
She did say they were
making her work today.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.330 align:middle
What about Tohru?

00:08:59.414 --> 00:09:01.041 align:middle
She said this letter's for you.

00:09:01.124 --> 00:09:02.334 align:middle
Let's see...

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.754 align:middle
[TOHRU] Kanna watched a survival
show and now she wants to go

00:09:05.837 --> 00:09:08.715 align:middle
to the mountains and
pretend to search for food.

00:09:08.798 --> 00:09:10.467 align:middle
I have to help out
at the maid café today,

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:12.552 align:middle
so I can't go with her.

00:09:12.635 --> 00:09:15.764 align:middle
I was hoping maybe
you would take her instead.

00:09:15.847 --> 00:09:17.974 align:middle
This means I do have
some faith in you,

00:09:18.058 --> 00:09:20.310 align:middle
so try to live up to it.

00:09:20.393 --> 00:09:22.812 align:middle
Oh, you have faith in me?

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:25.899 align:middle
That condescending tone
practically jumped off the page.

00:09:25.982 --> 00:09:28.443 align:middle
'Kay! Let's go!
The wilderness awaits!

00:09:28.526 --> 00:09:29.527 align:middle
Yay!

00:09:29.611 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle
Good job! You did it, Kanna!

00:09:34.574 --> 00:09:36.576 align:middle
Whoa...

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.790 align:middle
Let's set up our tent here.

00:09:43.041 --> 00:09:46.044 align:middle
Sorry. We ran into Shouta
on our way to your house,

00:09:46.127 --> 00:09:48.630 align:middle
and he asked to come to
the mountains with us.

00:09:48.713 --> 00:09:52.384 align:middle
I'm glad he did. So, what
are you two gonna do now?

00:09:52.467 --> 00:09:53.426 align:middle
Fish!

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:55.136 align:middle
We rented poles!

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.347 align:middle
[ELMA]
Fishing? That takes me back.

00:09:57.430 --> 00:09:58.390 align:middle
[KANNA]
Anacondas.

00:09:58.473 --> 00:10:01.476 align:middle
[ELMA]
Long ago, I was the one fished.

00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:17.534 align:middle
--'Kay, I'm bored.
--That was pretty fast.

00:10:17.617 --> 00:10:19.661 align:middle
Is there a way we can
speed these fish up?

00:10:19.744 --> 00:10:21.079 align:middle
Using our hands?

00:10:21.162 --> 00:10:22.789 align:middle
That might be more fun.

00:10:22.872 --> 00:10:24.958 align:middle
Why don't you try further down?

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.876 align:middle
There are more fish
in that area.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle
[KANNA]
Oh...!

00:10:31.006 --> 00:10:32.549 align:middle
Look! We caught one!

00:10:32.632 --> 00:10:35.176 align:middle
Yeah. I think that's where
I would've hidden, too.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:37.178 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Huh? Hid from what?

00:10:39.139 --> 00:10:40.724 align:middle
Ah...

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.809 align:middle
[gasping]

00:10:42.892 --> 00:10:45.270 align:middle
The curry and rice
are ready, too.

00:10:45.353 --> 00:10:47.647 align:middle
[GIRLS]
Yay!

00:10:47.731 --> 00:10:49.274 align:middle
Kanna, you've got a little
curry on your cheek.

00:10:49.357 --> 00:10:50.692 align:middle
[ELMA giggles] Chaperoning
children isn't as hard

00:10:50.775 --> 00:10:52.318 align:middle
as I thought.

00:10:53.862 --> 00:10:55.655 align:middle
[ELMA]
This curry's good...!

00:10:55.739 --> 00:10:57.282 align:middle
[ALL]
Thank you for the meal.

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:00.201 align:middle
[KANNA]
That's a neat bug, Saikawa.

00:11:00.285 --> 00:11:01.661 align:middle
Ah! Ew, gross!

00:11:01.745 --> 00:11:03.580 align:middle
They seem to be having fun.
I'm gonna go relax a bit.

00:11:03.663 --> 00:11:05.123 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Ah!

00:11:09.461 --> 00:11:10.420 align:middle
[ELMA sighs]

00:11:10.503 --> 00:11:12.005 align:middle
[KANNA]
Shouta, where are you going?

00:11:12.088 --> 00:11:14.591 align:middle
Research. I've been doing
a lot of reading lately

00:11:14.674 --> 00:11:16.885 align:middle
about how to draw mana
from the ley lines.

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.636 align:middle
They're supposed to be
especially strong

00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:19.763 align:middle
in the mountains.

00:11:19.846 --> 00:11:23.224 align:middle
That sounds like fun!
I wanna go, too!

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.602 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Why do boys love
the woods so much? Ew.

00:11:25.685 --> 00:11:27.604 align:middle
[laughing]

00:11:28.772 --> 00:11:30.815 align:middle
There's no way!
They were just here!

00:11:30.899 --> 00:11:32.317 align:middle
How did I lose them?!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:34.402 align:middle
They disappeared the moment
I took my eyes off of them!

00:11:34.486 --> 00:11:36.237 align:middle
I don't wanna hear it!

00:11:36.321 --> 00:11:38.865 align:middle
Wow. You couldn't handle
taking them on a picnic?

00:11:38.948 --> 00:11:40.533 align:middle
So lame.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:42.827 align:middle
Agh! No!

00:11:42.911 --> 00:11:45.205 align:middle
That's right, I completely
forgot I have clairvoyance!

00:11:45.288 --> 00:11:47.457 align:middle
I'll find them in no time!

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:48.541 align:middle
[SHOUTA gasps]

00:11:50.168 --> 00:11:51.878 align:middle
What's wrong, Shouta?

00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:55.090 align:middle
Someone just tried to hone in
on us from a distant location.

00:11:55.173 --> 00:11:58.009 align:middle
I'm sure it was Lucoa.
She does that sometimes.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:11:59.219 align:middle
But I blocked it.

00:11:59.302 --> 00:12:00.387 align:middle
Oh...!

00:12:00.470 --> 00:12:02.222 align:middle
You boys sure are silly.

00:12:02.305 --> 00:12:05.642 align:middle
That's weird.
Why can't I sense them?

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.687 align:middle
I never should've relied
on you to do anything.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.979 align:middle
Too bad.

00:12:10.063 --> 00:12:10.980 align:middle
[ELMA whimpering]

00:12:11.064 --> 00:12:13.191 align:middle
Tch. Lame.

[yells]
Where are you guys?!

00:12:16.236 --> 00:12:19.114 align:middle
[SAIKAWA gasps] Come on,
we should get back soon.

00:12:19.197 --> 00:12:22.033 align:middle
If it gets dark, it's possible
we could lose our way.

00:12:22.117 --> 00:12:23.785 align:middle
Oh, we're fine. Chill.

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:25.620 align:middle
We followed the
ley lines out here,

00:12:25.704 --> 00:12:27.997 align:middle
we can just trace them
again to get back.

00:12:28.081 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle
You boys.

00:12:37.632 --> 00:12:38.800 align:middle
Actually...

00:12:38.883 --> 00:12:41.428 align:middle
We left without saying
anything to Miss Elma.

--We should get back soon.
--[screaming]

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:45.974 align:middle
Did either of you hear
that scream just now?

00:12:46.057 --> 00:12:47.976 align:middle
Someone may have seen a bear.

00:12:49.978 --> 00:12:51.730 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Okay. We made it.

00:12:53.106 --> 00:12:55.191 align:middle
That's weird. She's not here.

00:12:55.275 --> 00:12:56.985 align:middle
Did she get mad and
go home because we left

00:12:57.068 --> 00:12:58.445 align:middle
without telling her?

00:12:58.528 --> 00:13:00.822 align:middle
She might've been worried
and gone out to look for us.

[KANNA]
Oh...

00:13:02.782 --> 00:13:05.493 align:middle
Damn it... where could they be?

You idiot!

Bow before me!

00:13:08.288 --> 00:13:09.748 align:middle
So useless...

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:13.293 align:middle
I keep hearing Tohru saying
mean things to me in my head!

00:13:14.252 --> 00:13:16.171 align:middle
Hi, excuse me!
I'm looking for someone!

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.672 align:middle
Have you seen any
children around here?

00:13:17.756 --> 00:13:19.382 align:middle
There are three of them.

How rude.

Do you want to be eaten?

Oh, man, thanks for the save.

Don't worry about it.

was actually quite tasty.

You ate flower nectar?

I will not let you call me
pathetic or ridiculous!

on you. Here's your coffee.

entertain a request from

I'll accept in honor of
that spirit, just this once.

You have my gratitude.

[REPORTER 209A] Today, we're
here with the mobile zoo,

appropriately named
"Zoo That Goes Anywhere!"

00:15:53.370 --> 00:15:55.663 align:middle
Amazing! The main
attraction appears to be

--this adorable giraffe!

Mm? What are you two doing here?

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:07.258 align:middle
[REPORTER 209A] We were able
to chat with the zoo director,

Mister Miyamoto!

00:16:13.807 --> 00:16:15.517 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] It's unusual
for Elma to ask Tohru

00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.519 align:middle
to go anywhere with her.

00:16:17.602 --> 00:16:20.271 align:middle
Much less something as casual
as joining her for exercise

00:16:20.355 --> 00:16:22.857 align:middle
because she's "feeling rusty."

00:16:22.941 --> 00:16:25.902 align:middle
What's even weirder is that
Tohru seemed to genuinely accept

00:16:25.985 --> 00:16:27.987 align:middle
the random invite.

00:16:28.071 --> 00:16:31.324 align:middle
Maybe the tension between them
is finally ironing out?

I'm so glad they're
getting along lately.

00:16:33.827 --> 00:16:35.620 align:middle
Elma's really softened up.

00:16:35.704 --> 00:16:37.205 align:middle
Don't be so naïve.

00:16:37.288 --> 00:16:39.708 align:middle
There's a reason the two of us
were called here today.

You're such a liar.

00:17:54.824 --> 00:17:58.953 align:middle
Are you trying to settle
things after all this time?

00:17:59.037 --> 00:18:01.247 align:middle
If I win this fight,
will you return home with me

00:18:01.331 --> 00:18:02.540 align:middle
to our world?

00:18:02.624 --> 00:18:04.209 align:middle
When will you let that go?!

00:18:04.292 --> 00:18:06.127 align:middle
You're dangerous--you know that?

00:18:06.211 --> 00:18:08.129 align:middle
Dangerous?

00:18:08.213 --> 00:18:09.673 align:middle
You've corrupted
the hearts of humans.

00:18:09.756 --> 00:18:11.007 align:middle
Huh?!

for mankind,
but make no mistake,

00:18:18.515 --> 00:18:21.476 align:middle
it's only because of
the faction she's in.

00:18:21.559 --> 00:18:24.896 align:middle
She's been used and betrayed.
Somewhere in her heart,

00:18:24.979 --> 00:18:27.982 align:middle
she holds contempt
for humans in general.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle
That's the main reason she still
sees Tohru as an enemy.

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:34.906 align:middle
I don't know if I believe
that one, Faf.

00:18:34.989 --> 00:18:37.367 align:middle
What?

00:18:37.450 --> 00:18:39.202 align:middle
[TOHRU grunts] I haven't
even thought about doing

00:18:39.285 --> 00:18:41.121 align:middle
anything wrong since I've
been here, and I don't plan on

00:18:41.204 --> 00:18:43.206 align:middle
changing that anytime soon!

00:18:43.289 --> 00:18:45.917 align:middle
All I did was make
a few friends to talk to!

00:18:46.001 --> 00:18:48.378 align:middle
How can you say that while
happily working in a maid café

00:18:48.461 --> 00:18:50.797 align:middle

of humans each day?!

[ELMA]
After so many times you swore

00:18:53.425 --> 00:18:56.845 align:middle
you would never trust them,
here you are serving them!

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.431 align:middle
And all this after you ridiculed
me for being worshipped

00:18:59.514 --> 00:19:01.433 align:middle
by humans in our original world!

00:19:01.516 --> 00:19:03.143 align:middle
Not true!

00:19:03.226 --> 00:19:04.728 align:middle
It wasn't because of their love.

00:19:04.811 --> 00:19:06.563 align:middle
It was because you
took advantage of it!

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:07.689 align:middle
You loved being on a pedestal,

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:09.774 align:middle
but you didn't
want to join them!

00:19:13.319 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle
You think you look so noble not
taking offerings made to you,

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:18.199 align:middle
but it's only because you still
buy them yourself!

00:19:18.283 --> 00:19:20.368 align:middle
[ELMA] The food we have in our
original world is much better

00:19:20.452 --> 00:19:21.995 align:middle

have to do with anything?!

Go back on your own
and leave me out of this!

00:19:37.010 --> 00:19:39.012 align:middle
The reason it was better...

00:19:39.095 --> 00:19:41.931 align:middle
...is because you were
there beside me!

00:19:43.058 --> 00:19:45.352 align:middle

Do you know how worried I was?!

The next thing I heard
was that you had died!

That's right... Then when
I finally found you again,

00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.028 align:middle
you had changed and
were blatantly cold to me...

friendships with humans.
