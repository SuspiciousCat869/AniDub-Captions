WEBVTT

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:09.917
[KOBAYASHI]
Wow...

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.542
What a beautiful
array of coding.

00:00:12.625 --> 00:00:14.375
Do you have any idea
who wrote this?

00:00:14.458 --> 00:00:16.583
Nope. No clue, I'm afraid.

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.250
Here's your tea, Miss Kobayashi.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.959
Thanks, Elma. Looks great.

00:00:20.041 --> 00:00:23.041
Oh no, why are you staring
at the code I wrote?

00:00:23.125 --> 00:00:24.750
Is there something
wrong with it?

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:26.125
No, actually...

00:00:26.208 --> 00:00:28.917
I was just saying I really--

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.333
Wait, who wrote this, again?

00:00:31.417 --> 00:00:32.875
That would be me, Miss.

00:02:03.583 --> 00:02:05.959
And I can continue
growing as well.

00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:07.625
Call me shallow,
but I just assumed you'd be

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.333
serving tea forever.

00:02:09.417 --> 00:02:10.709
What do you mean?!
You're the one

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:13.208
who gave me all those books
and told me to study!

00:02:13.291 --> 00:02:15.583
I guess you would have
high specs, being a dragon.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:18.417
Great work, Elma!
This is amazing!

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.250
[ELMA whimpers] Oh no...
Are you praising me, Miss?

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:23.208
Yes, I am! This means
we have another

00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:25.834
awesome fighting
member on our team!

00:02:25.917 --> 00:02:28.166
Way to go, Elma!

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.041
Thanks! All you have to do
is leave it to me!

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.125
Great. Could you start
by handling this, then?

00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:34.250
[ELMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:02:34.333 --> 00:02:35.291
--[KOBAYASHI] And this!
--[ELMA] Mm-hmm.

00:02:35.375 --> 00:02:36.417
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, and this one, too.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.417
[ELMA]
Mm-hmm.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.667
[KOBAYASHI]
And this.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.000
And this one, this one,
this one, and this one.

00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:41.083
We're counting on you.

00:02:41.166 --> 00:02:43.125
Hold on! That's too much!

00:02:43.208 --> 00:02:44.709
[TAKIYA]
No, it's not.

00:02:44.792 --> 00:02:46.875
That's the amount of work you
should be handling regularly.

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.333
[ELMA]
Uh?

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:49.875
Kobayashi's the one who's
been dealing with your share

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.667
of assignments
up until this point

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.250
while you were serving tea.

00:02:53.333 --> 00:02:54.625
[ELMA]
Huh...

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.875
[TAKIYA] She already has
way too much on her plate

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.542
without covering for you.

00:02:58.625 --> 00:03:00.875
Isn't that kind of
incredible, Mister Takiya?

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.291
Yes, it is.

00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:04.542
She is our pillar of strength.

00:03:04.625 --> 00:03:05.875
Pillar?

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.208
[growls]

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:09.792
She's a pillar? I see.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.375
[ELMA] Miss Kobayashi!
Please stand up!

00:03:13.458 --> 00:03:15.083
I challenge you to a duel!

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:16.417
--[KOBAYASHI] Huh?
--Come on!

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:17.750
Let's fight fair and square!

00:03:17.834 --> 00:03:19.291
[KOBAYASHI groans]

00:03:19.375 --> 00:03:21.125
[KOBAYASHI]
Where is this coming from?

00:03:21.208 --> 00:03:23.417
Maybe she's mad
I gave her too much?

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:26.083
Well, yeah, that's how Elma is!

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.625
Huh. I think I kind of
understand how you feel

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.125
when she comes after you.

00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:32.917
She challenges me to
the strangest matches, too.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.542
There were tests of strength,

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:37.709
then seeing whose tail was
longer, and even speed eating.

00:03:37.792 --> 00:03:39.709
One time, she challenged me
to see which one of us could

00:03:39.792 --> 00:03:42.125
strip the clothes
off of travelers first.

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:44.417
[KOBAYASHI] Wait, so you
were partners in crime?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.000
Now it makes sense why you were
playing together all the time.

00:03:47.083 --> 00:03:48.166
You're actually friends.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.417
We are certainly not!

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.792
Normally, we would be
trying to kill each other.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.750
Miss Kobayashi, please
be careful around Elma.

00:03:55.834 --> 00:03:58.792
Your gaze is as sharp as
those in the chaos faction.

00:03:58.875 --> 00:04:01.000
[KOBAYASHI] Is my resting
face really that bad?

00:04:01.083 --> 00:04:02.250
[ELMA]
Hello!

00:04:02.333 --> 00:04:04.208
You showed! You didn't run!

00:04:04.291 --> 00:04:05.875
Great!

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:08.875
[KOBAYASHI] Well, I did
consider taking some PTO.

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.500
Can we please deal with
this before we compete?

00:04:11.583 --> 00:04:12.917
[ELMA gasps]

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.291
[KOBAYASHI] It's one of
the limited-time sweets

00:04:14.375 --> 00:04:16.875
from the station.
A soft, sweet pudding.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.458
[ELMA whimpering]

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:21.125
[KOBAYASHI] Normally, this would
be all it takes to satisfy Elma.

00:04:22.709 --> 00:04:24.709
No! I'll have it
when I win the match!

00:04:24.792 --> 00:04:26.500
[KOBAYASHI]
Whatever works.

00:04:26.583 --> 00:04:28.500
[TAKIYA] The winner will be
whoever completes the most

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:29.834
of this work that
hasn't been touched

00:04:29.917 --> 00:04:30.834
since who-knows-when.

00:04:30.917 --> 00:04:31.917
[ELMA]
All right!

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.333
You say it hasn't
been touched yet,

00:04:33.417 --> 00:04:36.208
but someone has to be
responsible for it, right? Who?

00:04:36.291 --> 00:04:38.750
[TAKIYA]
Hah. That would be me.

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:41.709
I'm taking some time off.
Going to Akiba with Fafnir!

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:43.625
See you later!

00:04:43.709 --> 00:04:46.625
[KOBAYASHI] What a bastard.
At least he works hard.

00:04:46.709 --> 00:04:48.750
I honestly can't tell if
you're upset or grateful

00:04:48.834 --> 00:04:51.166
from the lack of
tone in your voice.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.625
Shall we get started?

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:54.959
[ELMA]
Uh, yeah.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:58.667
[KOBAYASHI] Welp. This might be
the world's lamest competition.

00:05:00.375 --> 00:05:02.250
[KOBAYASHI] It doesn't
matter if I win or lose,

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.750
the work gets done either way.

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:06.458
[STAFF 204A]
Time for lunch.

00:05:06.542 --> 00:05:09.250
[STAFF 204B] You feel like
doing some ramen again?

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:10.750
Why don't you
come with us, Elma?

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:13.458
No, thanks.
I still have a lot to do.

00:05:13.542 --> 00:05:16.959
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm. Beating a mere
human like me can't possibly

00:05:17.041 --> 00:05:18.875
make you any happier, can it?

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.959
If I upset you,
I sincerely apologize.

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:23.083
[ELMA]
I'm not mad.

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.458
And you shouldn't
sell yourself short.

00:05:25.542 --> 00:05:27.125
Don't become a pillar, either.

00:05:27.208 --> 00:05:28.375
A pillar?

00:05:28.458 --> 00:05:29.875
[ELMA]
That's right.

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:32.125
I've watched way too many
humans in despair become pillars

00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:34.041
in the other world.

00:05:34.125 --> 00:05:35.959
What does that mean?

00:05:36.041 --> 00:05:38.583
[ELMA] They support others by
becoming a sacrifice themselves.

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:40.166
[KOBAYASHI]
Human sacrifices?!

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:42.333
[ELMA] The dragons of the
harmony faction help humans,

00:05:42.417 --> 00:05:46.375
but many of my companions
demand sacrifices in exchange.

00:05:46.458 --> 00:05:48.917
Those people became
human pillars and died.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.375
I couldn't stand it
if that happened to you.

00:05:51.458 --> 00:05:52.583
[KOBAYASHI]
This conversation has taken

00:05:52.667 --> 00:05:54.291
an awfully dramatic turn.

00:05:54.375 --> 00:05:56.083
I feel like we're
losing you to your work!

00:05:56.166 --> 00:05:57.709
You have to stop
sacrificing yourself

00:05:57.792 --> 00:05:59.333
and your happiness here!

00:05:59.417 --> 00:06:02.333
The least you could do is
allow me to lead the others!

00:06:02.417 --> 00:06:05.667
Elma, could you bring
your head closer?

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.959
Then close your eyes?

00:06:07.041 --> 00:06:08.500
Huh? What do you mean?

00:06:08.583 --> 00:06:11.458
Miss Kobayashi, please,
you already have Tohru.

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:13.458
But, um, if you want
that from me, too,

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:15.750
I'm not one to tell
you what to do.

00:06:16.834 --> 00:06:19.458
--[KOBAYASHI] Wake up!
--Owie! Owie! Owie!

00:06:19.542 --> 00:06:21.834
What the heck's
the matter with you?!

00:06:21.917 --> 00:06:25.041
Phoo. That's called
an unnecessary concern.

00:06:25.125 --> 00:06:26.875
[ELMA]
What?

00:06:26.959 --> 00:06:28.834
The world you live in now
is different from the one

00:06:28.917 --> 00:06:31.208
you came from,
so take some time to breathe.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.291
Don't go thinking
everything is the same.

00:06:33.375 --> 00:06:34.834
[ELMA]
Huh...?

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:37.709
[KOBAYASHI] There are no human
sacrifices in modern Japan.

00:06:37.792 --> 00:06:40.041
Also, I still have my honor
as your senior here,

00:06:40.125 --> 00:06:41.125
so lay off my work.

00:06:41.208 --> 00:06:43.000
[ELMA sighs]
I see.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:46.458
I think we should go ahead
and end this competition. Yeah?

00:06:46.542 --> 00:06:47.792
[ELMA]
'Kay.

00:06:47.875 --> 00:06:50.208
I appreciate how concerned
you were for me, though.

00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:52.166
Thank you, Elma.

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.417
[ELMA]
Sure.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.834
[KOBAYASHI] Another day,
another yen, amirite?

00:06:55.917 --> 00:06:59.166
Okay, Elma! You're coming
with us to have drinks tonight.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.709
Drinks?

00:07:00.792 --> 00:07:03.458
Yeah, Takiya's already standing
by at our usual watering hole.

00:07:03.542 --> 00:07:06.583
[ELMA chuckles] I bet it'll be
fun to drink with everyone.

00:07:06.667 --> 00:07:08.458
[KOBAYASHI] Uh, yeah.
And there are some things

00:07:08.542 --> 00:07:10.667
you can only talk about
with liquid courage.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.667
[ELMA]
Now I'm excited!

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.000
And what's up with
that outfit?! Ew!

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:16.750
You dragons
really piss me off!

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:18.834
You think you can wear
whatever you want! False!

00:07:18.917 --> 00:07:20.750
You can't just wear
glasses for fun!

00:07:20.834 --> 00:07:22.667
Blindness is not
a fashion statement!

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:24.250
[KOBAYASHI]
No one's tits are that huge!

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.542
As one who wears glasses, I
know there are big differences

00:07:26.625 --> 00:07:28.375
in sizes and frames!
If you're gonna wear them,

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:29.875
you need to take a frame
and size class first!

00:07:29.959 --> 00:07:32.333
--[ELMA] I wanna go home...
--[KOBAYASHI] Yeah!

00:07:35.625 --> 00:07:37.583
[TAKIYA] This is a popular
collaboration café!

00:07:37.667 --> 00:07:40.000
We're pretty lucky
it's emptier on weekdays.

00:07:41.458 --> 00:07:42.417
Yeah.

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:43.959
[WAITRESS 204A]
Sorry for the wait.

00:07:44.041 --> 00:07:47.792
Here's the special bonus
illustrated coaster you ordered.

00:07:47.875 --> 00:07:50.208
There are 15 types
handed out at random.

00:07:50.291 --> 00:07:52.083
I need you to be my
partner-in-gathering-stuff

00:07:52.166 --> 00:07:54.542
until I can collect them all!

00:07:54.625 --> 00:07:56.625
Let's make it happen.

00:07:56.709 --> 00:07:59.250
[TAKIYA chuckles]

00:07:59.333 --> 00:08:02.583
[KOBAYASHI] That's scary.
They're recruiting for patrols.

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:04.875
Yeah, they asked me
if I wanted to work for them.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:06.291
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh?

00:08:06.375 --> 00:08:07.542
They were impressed with
my skills after they saw me

00:08:07.625 --> 00:08:10.083
catch that thief in
the shopping district.

00:08:10.166 --> 00:08:13.208
Right. That actually
happened, didn't it?

00:08:14.959 --> 00:08:16.625
[KOBAYASHI]
You think it would be safe?

00:08:16.709 --> 00:08:18.917
Ah! Sweet of you
to worry about me!

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.542
[KOBAYASHI grunts]
For others.

00:08:20.625 --> 00:08:22.667
[TOHRU sobs]
Aw, dammit!

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:25.125
Thanks so much for
coming today, Tohru.

00:08:25.208 --> 00:08:28.125
You're in normal clothes.
What a surprise.

00:08:28.208 --> 00:08:29.792
[TOHRU] Miss Kobayashi
said I should wear more

00:08:29.875 --> 00:08:31.500
than just my uniform.

00:08:31.583 --> 00:08:34.291
So, um, how would you
like me to patrol for you?

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:36.291
All you have to do is walk
around the area and see

00:08:36.375 --> 00:08:38.041
if you spot anything strange.

00:08:38.125 --> 00:08:40.125
It can be a little
scary sometimes.

00:08:40.208 --> 00:08:43.125
There's nothing in any of
the worlds that can scare me!

00:08:43.208 --> 00:08:45.291
I'm a chaos dragon
born to be feared!

00:08:45.375 --> 00:08:47.583
Oh, that's so cute.

00:08:47.667 --> 00:08:50.166
[TOHRU] Miss Sasakibe,
do you know any martial arts?

00:08:50.250 --> 00:08:51.750
No, nothing at all.

00:08:51.834 --> 00:08:54.583
So then, you'd be a hindrance
to me if something does happen.

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:57.417
[giggles]
Nothing is going to happen.

00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.583
I promise, this is one of the
safest areas you could be in.

00:09:01.792 --> 00:09:03.583
[SASAKIBE]
A red zone already?!

00:09:03.667 --> 00:09:05.166
Why today of all days?!

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.166
[whimpering]

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.667
Miss Sasakibe,
are you all right?

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:09.250
U-Uh-h-huh...

00:09:09.333 --> 00:09:11.667
They're blocking the street and
getting in the way, aren't they?

00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:13.083
We should go warn them.

00:09:13.166 --> 00:09:14.166
[gasps]
Maybe--

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.583
Hey, you guys.

00:09:16.667 --> 00:09:18.792
You're disrupting the
neighborhood by loitering here!

00:09:18.875 --> 00:09:20.667
Oh, are we?!

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:22.417
You got a problem with us?

00:09:22.500 --> 00:09:24.000
I sure do.

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:26.625
What kind of species doesn't
understand its own language?

00:09:26.709 --> 00:09:30.291
Huh?! Quit screwing
around with me!

00:09:30.375 --> 00:09:31.750
You idiot!

00:09:31.834 --> 00:09:33.291
--He lashes out way too fast!
--[SASAKIBE whimpers]

00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.875
[DELINQUENT 204A groans]

00:09:37.959 --> 00:09:39.083
[gasping]

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:41.083
[TOHRU] I will only
warn you one more time,

00:09:41.166 --> 00:09:44.291
so if you don't understand,
then I will give up hope.

00:09:44.375 --> 00:09:45.291
[demonic]
Go away.

00:09:45.375 --> 00:09:46.500
[DELINQUENTS screaming]

00:09:46.583 --> 00:09:48.750
You're gonna regret
picking a fight with us!

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:50.834
Team Dragon Busters, out!

00:09:50.917 --> 00:09:54.417
That's the most obnoxious name
I've ever heard. So...

00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.041
Let's regroup and
get back to our patrol.

00:09:57.125 --> 00:09:59.375
Do you know what you'll do
if they come back for revenge?

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:01.583
Uh. Yeah, first, I'd make him--

00:10:01.667 --> 00:10:02.583
[ELMA gasps]

00:10:02.667 --> 00:10:03.834
That's the most
suspicious person

00:10:03.917 --> 00:10:05.083
I've ever seen in my life!

00:10:05.166 --> 00:10:06.917
Huh?! What are
you talking about?!

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.625
You're skipping out
on work, aren't you?!

00:10:08.709 --> 00:10:10.625
No, I got out early today!

00:10:10.709 --> 00:10:13.542
Huh? What's with that
armband you're wearing?

00:10:13.625 --> 00:10:14.959
[TOHRU] I'm on patrol
to maintain the peace

00:10:15.041 --> 00:10:16.750
for the neighborhood,
of course.

00:10:16.834 --> 00:10:18.667
[ELMA]
Huh...? You are...?

00:10:18.750 --> 00:10:20.125
You're doing something
to preserve the peace

00:10:20.208 --> 00:10:21.834
of the city we live in?

00:10:21.917 --> 00:10:23.792
That's what I said.
Did I stutter?

00:10:23.875 --> 00:10:25.125
[ELMA whimpers]

00:10:25.208 --> 00:10:27.667
[sobbing]

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.750
Really?! I'm glad you've
finally found it for yourself!

00:10:30.834 --> 00:10:32.583
--You believe in justice!
--[TOHRU] Huh?

00:10:32.667 --> 00:10:34.041
This is the best news!

00:10:34.125 --> 00:10:36.208
From now on,
you're an agent of harmony!

00:10:36.291 --> 00:10:38.750
I would be so honored to
help you with your patrol!

00:10:38.834 --> 00:10:41.709
Uh. I get the feeling you
didn't understand what I said.

00:10:41.792 --> 00:10:44.000
Oh, a-are you saying
you'd like to take my place?

00:10:44.083 --> 00:10:45.333
Miss Sasakibe?!

00:10:45.417 --> 00:10:48.875
I mean, you told me I'd be
a hindrance, didn't you?

00:10:48.959 --> 00:10:50.542
[ELMA] Oh, come on,
I'm a bit more experienced

00:10:50.625 --> 00:10:52.458
at detecting evil than you are.

00:10:52.542 --> 00:10:54.333
You can ask me
anything you want.

00:10:54.417 --> 00:10:56.625
I'd like to know the fastest
way to get rid of you.

00:10:56.709 --> 00:10:58.709
Don't be embarrassed!
[giggles]

00:10:58.792 --> 00:11:01.375
There are times
you can be super cute.

00:11:01.458 --> 00:11:03.250
[TOHRU]
So annoying...

00:11:03.333 --> 00:11:06.583
I'd like to know what it is
exactly that you consider evil?

00:11:06.667 --> 00:11:08.750
I think it's okay to overlook
some mild misconduct

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:11.166
as long as it's not
bothering anybody.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:12.917
Well, there's a book
of laws, right?

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:15.291
They shouldn't be doing anything
against what's in there.

00:11:15.375 --> 00:11:17.583
[BOY 204A] Hurry up!
It's about to turn red!

00:11:17.667 --> 00:11:20.125
--[GIRL 204A panting]
--[BOY 204A chuckles]

00:11:20.208 --> 00:11:21.250
Hold it!

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:23.792
[panting]
That's a traffic violation!

00:11:23.875 --> 00:11:25.667
And a major fine, to boot!

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:28.125
Prepare to be punished,
you wicked villains!

00:11:28.208 --> 00:11:29.542
[BOTH wail]

00:11:29.625 --> 00:11:31.875
Okay, okay, take a deep breath
and lay off the kids.

00:11:31.959 --> 00:11:33.959
What?! Are you defending evil?!

00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:36.375
I take it back--
you are a chaos dragon!

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:38.333
Calm down. If you're
going to waste your time

00:11:38.417 --> 00:11:40.667
chasing after the little
things, I'm going home.

00:11:40.750 --> 00:11:42.375
And what was that
about punishment?

00:11:42.458 --> 00:11:44.333
Violence isn't going
to solve anything.

00:11:44.417 --> 00:11:46.250
Oh. Sorry, Tohru,
but you're starting to sound

00:11:46.333 --> 00:11:47.709
a lot like Miss Kobayashi.

00:11:47.792 --> 00:11:50.250
Ah?! Really?!
You mean it, Elma?!

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:52.583
You get me, don't you?
I had a feeling you did!

00:11:52.667 --> 00:11:53.917
Awkward.

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.333
[TOHRU] You keep focusing
on the little things

00:11:55.417 --> 00:11:57.500
because you're walking
without purpose.

00:11:57.583 --> 00:11:59.417
We must find
this suspicious person.

00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:01.125
So what do they look like?

00:12:01.208 --> 00:12:03.542
Well, according to the flyer,
they were dressed entirely

00:12:03.625 --> 00:12:05.709
in black and had long hair.

00:12:05.792 --> 00:12:09.041
He's also described as a tall
man with sharp eyes and glasses.

00:12:09.125 --> 00:12:11.458
Oh, That sounds
easy to identify.

00:12:11.542 --> 00:12:13.750
It says here he was last
seen dancing on the streets

00:12:13.834 --> 00:12:15.959
on his way to an
elementary school.

00:12:16.041 --> 00:12:18.583
I see. So kinda like that?

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:21.000
Yeah, exactly like that.

00:12:22.792 --> 00:12:25.125
What is the meaning of this?

00:12:25.208 --> 00:12:26.709
[FAFNIR]
I was going over my choreography

00:12:26.792 --> 00:12:28.583
for an event with Takiya.

00:12:28.667 --> 00:12:30.542
Why do you have
to do it out here?

00:12:30.625 --> 00:12:32.291
Because our room is too small?

00:12:32.375 --> 00:12:34.750
Try to remember you're a
fearsome dragon and do your best

00:12:34.834 --> 00:12:36.875
to avoid suspicious behavior.

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:39.959
She's right, Faf.
You need to be more self-aware.

00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:41.083
[FAFNIR]
And you two?

00:12:41.166 --> 00:12:42.583
We're patrolling the streets.

00:12:42.667 --> 00:12:44.500
[FAFNIR]
Excellent work.

00:12:44.583 --> 00:12:48.250
A chaos faction and a harmony
faction member working together

00:12:48.333 --> 00:12:51.500
in a world that seems determined
to drive everyone in it crazy.

00:12:51.583 --> 00:12:54.166
[TOHRU] Yet, you seem to be the
only one here bothered by it.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.625
And save the lectures
about being too influenced.

00:12:56.709 --> 00:12:58.250
[FAFNIR]
You're wrong.

00:12:58.333 --> 00:13:00.792
Lately, I feel like
I understand you.

00:13:00.875 --> 00:13:02.333
But...

00:13:02.417 --> 00:13:05.291
I still think it's
enormously dangerous here.

00:13:05.375 --> 00:13:07.542
The common sense of this
world doesn't completely mesh

00:13:07.625 --> 00:13:10.458
with our understanding.
It's not how we were created.

00:13:10.542 --> 00:13:11.917
Never forget that.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.166
Isn't it our differences
that make living here so fun?

00:13:15.250 --> 00:13:16.166
[ELMA gasps]

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:18.166
[DELINQUENT 204A]
I found you!

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:23.166
Oh, you thought you
were gonna get away with

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:25.125
that stunt, didn't you?!

00:13:25.208 --> 00:13:26.875
[DELINQUENT 204E] You seem
like you could hold your own,

00:13:26.959 --> 00:13:29.041
but maybe not while he's here.

00:13:29.125 --> 00:13:30.625
The strongest
local delinquent--

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:32.625
they call him the
Dragon of Destruction.

00:13:32.709 --> 00:13:34.709
[chuckles]
A woman, huh?

00:13:34.792 --> 00:13:36.500
I always say,
if you can put up a fight,

00:13:36.583 --> 00:13:38.542
it doesn't matter
what your gender is.

00:13:38.625 --> 00:13:40.500
But if you can't fight,
then I suggest you hurry up

00:13:40.583 --> 00:13:42.834
and apologize
for wasting my time.

00:13:42.917 --> 00:13:44.959
Do you still think
you can fight me?

00:13:45.041 --> 00:13:47.625
I hope you're not
expecting any mercy!

00:13:47.709 --> 00:13:49.959
[DELINQUENTS]
Go get her, Ryuu!

00:13:50.041 --> 00:13:52.959

00:13:53.041 --> 00:13:54.542
[DELINQUENTS]
Ryuu!

00:13:54.625 --> 00:13:56.083
[TOHRU]
There are way too many of them.

00:13:56.166 --> 00:13:59.083
I guess I'll wear the dirty
clothes Miss Kobayashi gave me.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.709
[RYUU grunting]

00:14:02.792 --> 00:14:04.250
[DELINQUENTS]
Ryuu!

00:14:04.333 --> 00:14:06.709
[TOHRU] If you don't understand
by now, then you never will.

00:14:06.792 --> 00:14:07.792
[DELINQUENTS]
Ryuu!

00:14:07.875 --> 00:14:09.709
[TOHRU]
You will never oppose me again!

00:14:09.792 --> 00:14:11.959
[DELINQUENTS]
Ryuu!

00:14:12.041 --> 00:14:14.041
[TOHRU bellows]

00:14:14.125 --> 00:14:16.542
Will you shut up?!

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:20.959
[DELINQUENTS screaming]

In a way, this job
could be considered

a type of parlor maid.

that's stretching it just a bit?

Weird. There're
way too many me's.

What is the purpose of
having mirrors covering

every inch of the walls?

00:17:09.166 --> 00:17:11.000
The better to reexamine

That doesn't sound like
fun to me, Tohru.

But I guess... I agree that fun
is more about who you're with

Humans are disgusting monsters!

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.041
How did you even
jump to that interpretation?!

00:21:23.125 --> 00:21:25.166
If you'd let me take you
everywhere, it'd be like

00:21:25.250 --> 00:21:27.709
going to your personal
amusement park every day!

00:21:27.792 --> 00:21:30.458
[KOBAYASHI]
That only has roller coasters!

00:21:30.542 --> 00:21:32.583
[KOBAYASHI]
Although... Maybe...

00:21:32.667 --> 00:21:35.750
Maybe I could do something
like this every now and then.

00:21:35.834 --> 00:21:38.041
Nah, it's not good for the hips.

00:21:44.166 --> 00:21:45.959
[CLASSMATE 204A]
Nae.

00:21:46.041 --> 00:21:48.834
Nae?

00:21:48.917 --> 00:21:50.083
Georgie.

00:21:50.166 --> 00:21:53.208
Oh. Hi. Good morning
to you, ladies.

00:21:53.291 --> 00:21:54.333
[CLASSMATE 204A]
What the...?

00:21:54.417 --> 00:21:56.792
Did you forget your
own name just now?

00:21:56.875 --> 00:21:58.208
[GEORGIE]
Hmm?

00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:30.375
[SAIKAWA]
Hi, Kanna's Mom!

00:23:30.458 --> 00:23:32.542
I brought you the photos
from the amusement park.

00:23:32.625 --> 00:23:33.709
There're thousands!

00:23:33.792 --> 00:23:35.083
[KOBAYASHI]
Wow, that's a lot.

00:23:35.166 --> 00:23:36.750
[SAIKAWA] It is?! Then I'll
go through all of them

00:23:36.834 --> 00:23:38.500
and only show you the best ones.

00:23:38.583 --> 00:23:40.625
[KOBAYASHI] Still a lot.
Don't worry about it.

00:23:40.709 --> 00:23:42.291
I'm sure they're all amazing.

00:23:43.917 --> 00:23:46.375
