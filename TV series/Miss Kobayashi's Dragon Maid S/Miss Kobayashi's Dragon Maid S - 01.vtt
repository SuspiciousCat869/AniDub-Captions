[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi, Miss Kobayashi!

00:00:09.718 --> 00:00:12.804 align:middle
If someone asked, you'd say
I'm the ultimate maid, right?

00:00:12.887 --> 00:00:15.056 align:middle
No, of course I wouldn't.
What are you up to?

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle
You're wrong. I think
I'm the ultimate maid

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:19.019 align:middle
and that's the only thing
that matters.

00:00:19.102 --> 00:00:20.437 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
So pretty.

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.564 align:middle
[TOHRU] Hold on.
Look at this book I found.

00:00:22.647 --> 00:00:24.649 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
A Maid café's opening?

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.942 align:middle
And it's close, too.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:27.527 align:middle
[TOHRU] It says all
who enter will be welcomed

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.945 align:middle
by the best maids!

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.739 align:middle
Best maids?! But how?!

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:31.990 align:middle
Who do they think they are?!

00:00:32.073 --> 00:00:34.826 align:middle
Making such false
claims without me! [sighs]

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.246 align:middle
Huh. That's right.
No one should make false claims.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.125 align:middle
Including the dragon in front
of me currently making them.

00:00:42.208 --> 00:00:45.003 align:middle
Then I'll just turn the café to
ash and their business will fail

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.339 align:middle
as a result of my cursed flames!

00:00:47.422 --> 00:00:48.757 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Your literal burning love?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.883 align:middle
[laughs]

00:00:51.217 --> 00:00:52.886 align:middle
I highly advise against it.

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.805 align:middle
Noted! I'm going
to scout out the enemy!

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.393 align:middle
I wonder if Tohru's okay.

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle
I've returned from
the mortal beyond.

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:03.396 align:middle
Welcome home.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.690 align:middle
How'd it go?
Did you destroy anything?

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.984 align:middle
Of course not.
I wound up getting a job there!

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:09.194 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
How?!

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:11.363 align:middle
[TOHRU giggles]

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.791 align:middle
[TOHRU] I proudly stormed
the enemy's evil den

00:02:46.875 --> 00:02:48.001 align:middle
to find their leader!

00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:49.502 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
There's an evil den?

00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:50.920 align:middle
Fear me!

00:02:51.004 --> 00:02:53.381 align:middle
Oh. Are you here to interview
for the new maid job?

00:02:53.465 --> 00:02:56.426 align:middle
You're awfully presumptuous--
wearing a maid outfit already.

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:57.469 align:middle
You're pretty, though.

00:02:57.552 --> 00:02:58.470 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hmm?

00:02:58.553 --> 00:03:00.472 align:middle
And I love your
positive attitude!

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:02.557 align:middle
--You're hired!
--[MAIDS] Yay!

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.893 align:middle
And that's how
I returned home victorious!

00:03:04.976 --> 00:03:07.103 align:middle
They call that an interview?!
They're screwed!

00:03:07.187 --> 00:03:08.938 align:middle
[TOHRU] I've had a lot of free
time on my hands lately

00:03:09.022 --> 00:03:10.482 align:middle
since you and Kanna
are always out.

00:03:10.565 --> 00:03:12.067 align:middle
I need to fill it somehow.

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.611 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] You're like a bored
housewife getting a job for fun.

00:03:14.694 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle
So you're serious
about doing this?

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:18.073 align:middle
Can you handle it?

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:19.616 align:middle
What are you talking about?

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:22.827 align:middle
I gladly work as a maid
every day of my life for free!

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.287 align:middle
I'm used to it now!

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle
Don't. Tohru, I may have a
job at a bigger company now,

00:03:28.291 --> 00:03:29.626 align:middle
but when I was living
with my parents,

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.169 align:middle
I worked at a restaurant.

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:34.089 align:middle
Trust me. Don't underestimate
the service industry.

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:35.632 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi?!

00:03:35.715 --> 00:03:37.634 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Don't get me wrong,
cosplay maids at maid cafés

00:03:37.717 --> 00:03:39.803 align:middle
offend me in ways
I can't even get into,

00:03:39.886 --> 00:03:42.722 align:middle
but their customer service
is worthy of respect.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:45.225 align:middle
[sighs] This is a great
opportunity, Tohru.

00:03:45.308 --> 00:03:47.727 align:middle
It'll be good for you to learn
about the service industry.

00:03:47.811 --> 00:03:50.522 align:middle
You look scary
when you point like that.

00:03:50.605 --> 00:03:51.690 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Well. It's been a while

00:03:51.773 --> 00:03:53.358 align:middle
since we had that conversation.

00:03:53.441 --> 00:03:55.402 align:middle
I wonder how Tohru's
doing at her new job.

00:03:55.485 --> 00:03:58.238 align:middle
Kobayashi, you're a worrywart.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:03:59.823 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Is this it?

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.325 align:middle
Hello and welcome home,
my Master.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:03.326 align:middle
[gasps]

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.869 align:middle
And welcome, young lady.

00:04:04.953 --> 00:04:08.707 align:middle
Ohh... Lotsa people
dressed like Lady Tohru!

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.583 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Interesting design.

00:04:10.667 --> 00:04:13.628 align:middle
Looks like this café went
with plain-style maids.

00:04:13.712 --> 00:04:16.089 align:middle
People don't use the word
moé very much anymore,

00:04:16.172 --> 00:04:18.133 align:middle
but they've definitely kept
the essence of those times

00:04:18.216 --> 00:04:19.467 align:middle
in their theme.

00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:20.635 align:middle
Let's check out the menu.

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.263 align:middle
Ooh! This is also
true to those roots.

00:04:23.346 --> 00:04:25.598 align:middle
There's a special service
with every menu item.

00:04:25.682 --> 00:04:27.058 align:middle
I'm betting the
magic chants like,

00:04:27.142 --> 00:04:28.727 align:middle
"Fill thy tummy
with much yummy,"

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.311 align:middle
are different for each as well.

00:04:30.395 --> 00:04:32.647 align:middle
You know a lot, Kobayashi.

00:04:32.731 --> 00:04:34.941 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] I'm gonna
tell you a secret, Kanna.

00:04:35.025 --> 00:04:38.778 align:middle
One time, long ago, I tried
working in a café like this.

00:04:38.862 --> 00:04:41.906 align:middle
[groans] It didn't, uh...
It didn't work out.

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.242 align:middle
I don't get it, but I'm sorry.

00:04:44.325 --> 00:04:45.702 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Wait a minute, where's Tohru?

00:04:45.785 --> 00:04:46.745 align:middle
Back there.

00:04:46.828 --> 00:04:48.163 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:52.167 align:middle
[TOHRU growls]

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:55.879 align:middle
Table ten, your order's up!

00:04:55.962 --> 00:04:56.880 align:middle
On it!

00:04:56.963 --> 00:04:57.881 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I'm running low on plates,

00:04:57.964 --> 00:04:59.132 align:middle
so let's get some out fast!

00:04:59.215 --> 00:05:00.508 align:middle
Right away!

00:05:00.592 --> 00:05:01.593 align:middle
[TOHRU grunts]

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.517 align:middle
[TOHRU sighs]

00:05:09.601 --> 00:05:10.560 align:middle
[giggles]

00:05:10.643 --> 00:05:12.896 align:middle
Incredible!
Way to go, Head Chef!

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.856 align:middle
Thanks for everything
you do to help us, Chef!

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:15.982 align:middle
Chef Tohru's the best!

00:05:16.066 --> 00:05:17.525 align:middle
No, thank you!

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.904 align:middle
I'm grateful to have a team who
works together so efficiently!

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:23.031 align:middle
[gasps]
Hi, Miss Kobayashi!

00:05:23.114 --> 00:05:24.532 align:middle
You came to see me?

00:05:24.616 --> 00:05:27.035 align:middle
Wow, you're doing a great job.
I'm truly surprised.

00:05:27.118 --> 00:05:29.579 align:middle
[TOHRU giggles]
Told ya I was the best!

00:05:29.662 --> 00:05:31.956 align:middle
It's actually been quite
easy for me to handle!

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.626 align:middle
I've taken another step
forward as a maid.

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.628 align:middle
Except... Uh...

00:05:36.711 --> 00:05:40.465 align:middle
[wails] I'm not
working as a maid at all!

00:05:40.548 --> 00:05:41.841 align:middle
You're a chef.

00:05:41.925 --> 00:05:43.718 align:middle
I'm gonna get someone on
the floor to switch with me!

00:05:43.802 --> 00:05:44.844 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] I actually
think they put you

00:05:44.928 --> 00:05:46.554 align:middle
in the right position.

00:05:46.638 --> 00:05:49.099 align:middle
It's the right position
for a volcanic dragon!

00:05:49.182 --> 00:05:50.433 align:middle
Hmph!

00:05:50.517 --> 00:05:52.268 align:middle
Please go out
and come back in again!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.395 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh...?

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.522 align:middle
Time to turn delicious now!
[giggles]

00:05:55.605 --> 00:05:56.773 align:middle
It's good.

00:05:56.856 --> 00:05:58.191 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Greetings!

00:05:58.274 --> 00:06:00.068 align:middle
Welcome, Kobayashi!

00:06:00.151 --> 00:06:01.444 align:middle
You're supposed to say "Master."

00:06:01.528 --> 00:06:03.279 align:middle
When Head Chef
first started on the floor,

00:06:03.363 --> 00:06:05.615 align:middle
she said, "I refuse to
call anyone 'Master'

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:07.450 align:middle
but Miss Kobayashi!"

00:06:07.534 --> 00:06:08.868 align:middle
That's weird, because
she doesn't call me

00:06:08.952 --> 00:06:10.620 align:middle
"Master" at home. Ever.

00:06:10.704 --> 00:06:13.123 align:middle
Will you please have a seat
in our comfy booth?

00:06:13.206 --> 00:06:16.042 align:middle
You mean I can finally
order something?

00:06:16.126 --> 00:06:18.753 align:middle
Omurice, please!
Gimme Omurice!

00:06:18.837 --> 00:06:20.797 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay. Two Omurices.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.259 align:middle
Sure! They'll be out in a flash!

00:06:24.342 --> 00:06:27.429 align:middle
Now I have to perform a spell
to make it super delicious!

00:06:27.512 --> 00:06:28.805 align:middle
Make it adorable.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.265 align:middle
'Kay!

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:33.309 align:middle
I call upon the Shadow King
who rules this world.

00:06:33.393 --> 00:06:36.271 align:middle
Make this the greatest
it can be with your dark arts!

00:06:36.354 --> 00:06:39.274 align:middle
I beseech thee for quality
worthy of praise!

00:06:39.357 --> 00:06:40.942 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Raise its value and bring forth

00:06:41.026 --> 00:06:42.777 align:middle
a monument to your glory!

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.946 align:middle
Let my magic spread
and bring corruption.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.408 align:middle
Let my ideals erode the world
and bring mass chaos!

00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:51.828 align:middle
Replace all that is organic
with palatable falsehood!

00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:54.039 align:middle
[yells]

00:06:54.122 --> 00:06:58.752 align:middle
Be ever so delicious,
moé-moé, kyun!

00:06:58.835 --> 00:07:00.503 align:middle
--[sighs]
--[KOBAYASHI groans]

00:07:01.546 --> 00:07:04.924 align:middle
[TOHRU] Yummy to the tummy!
I hope you like it!

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:07.552 align:middle
You used actual magic!
A curse, in fact!

00:07:07.635 --> 00:07:08.595 align:middle
So good...

00:07:08.678 --> 00:07:10.013 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Bring me the Head Chef!

00:07:10.096 --> 00:07:11.348 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hello there!

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:15.352 align:middle
I am your Head Chef, Maid,
and, of course, Dragon,

00:07:15.435 --> 00:07:17.187 align:middle
Tohru the Great!

00:07:20.482 --> 00:07:23.860 align:middle
Okay, she's got talent,
but is it enough?

00:07:23.943 --> 00:07:25.070 align:middle
[TOHRU] I don't want
to be anyone's maid

00:07:25.153 --> 00:07:27.405 align:middle
but Miss Kobayashi's,
so I'm gonna quit.

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:28.948 align:middle
Thank you.

00:07:29.032 --> 00:07:30.909 align:middle
--[MAIDS] You can't!
--Huh?

00:07:30.992 --> 00:07:32.369 align:middle
Don't do that to us!

00:07:32.452 --> 00:07:34.287 align:middle
Our café's become famous
because of the taste

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.331 align:middle
of the recipes you created!

00:07:36.414 --> 00:07:38.375 align:middle
There are so many posts
spreading about it online

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.793 align:middle
by word of mouth!

00:07:39.876 --> 00:07:40.960 align:middle
--[MAID 201B] Head Chef!
--[MAID 201C] Please don't!

00:07:41.044 --> 00:07:45.048 align:middle
--[MAID 201A] Head Chef!
--Well... maybe...

00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:47.175 align:middle
I'll teach you the magic chant
so you can make your food

00:07:47.258 --> 00:07:49.552 align:middle
delicious after I'm
gone. Make notes.

00:07:49.636 --> 00:07:51.596 align:middle
In order for a human to do it,
first you'll have to

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.306 align:middle
draw this magic circle.

00:07:55.475 --> 00:07:56.559 align:middle
[TAKIYA chuckling]

00:07:56.643 --> 00:07:58.687 align:middle
Good afternoon and
welcome home, my master.

00:07:58.770 --> 00:08:01.314 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Oh my, what a nice café!

00:08:01.398 --> 00:08:03.024 align:middle
We'll take two omurices.

00:08:03.108 --> 00:08:05.402 align:middle
Yes, sir, coming right up.
Here we go.

00:08:05.485 --> 00:08:08.405 align:middle
Now I'll cast a spell
to make it delicious!

00:08:08.488 --> 00:08:11.157 align:middle
I call upon the Shadow
King that rules this world.

00:08:11.241 --> 00:08:13.118 align:middle
Make this dish the greatest
it can be with your dark arts!

00:08:13.201 --> 00:08:16.204 align:middle
I think this is the most unique
maid café I've ever been to!

00:08:27.674 --> 00:08:29.384 align:middle
[growls]

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:33.221 align:middle
I am a maid, not a chef!

00:08:33.304 --> 00:08:35.640 align:middle
Where are all the rave reviews
about me as a maid?!

00:08:35.724 --> 00:08:36.683 align:middle
[whines]

00:08:36.766 --> 00:08:38.601 align:middle
Do me a favor and
spare the mouse.

00:08:46.026 --> 00:08:47.777 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER 201A] We predict
sudden changes in the weather

00:08:47.861 --> 00:08:48.987 align:middle
throughout the day.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:51.573 align:middle
So please stay tuned
for developing reports.

00:08:51.656 --> 00:08:53.283 align:middle
Next up is the news.

00:08:53.366 --> 00:08:56.161 align:middle
There was a large-scale
landslide early this morning.

00:08:56.244 --> 00:08:57.746 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Whoa.

00:08:57.829 --> 00:08:59.122 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER 1A]
It looks like part of the earth

00:08:59.205 --> 00:09:00.623 align:middle
was sliced away.

00:09:00.707 --> 00:09:03.293 align:middle
It's the mountain where I met
you, Tohru. That's weird.

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:06.129 align:middle
How could they do that to our
precious, sacred spot?!

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:07.964 align:middle
I'll find the culprit behind
this and send them

00:09:08.048 --> 00:09:09.549 align:middle
to Gehenna and Jahannam!

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.718 align:middle
Then I'll crush their bones
and feed them to Amam!

00:09:11.801 --> 00:09:12.844 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
But the only ones who could

00:09:12.927 --> 00:09:14.971 align:middle
do something like that are...

00:09:15.055 --> 00:09:16.556 align:middle
It couldn't possibly be me.

00:09:16.639 --> 00:09:18.058 align:middle
I was reviewing
the new parameters

00:09:18.141 --> 00:09:20.226 align:middle
for a game event at that time.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.688 align:middle
Lucoa's been out of
the country since yesterday.

00:09:23.772 --> 00:09:26.066 align:middle
Unfortunately, I always
know where she is

00:09:26.149 --> 00:09:29.194 align:middle
because we're bound.
We're bound by magic.

00:09:29.277 --> 00:09:31.571 align:middle
It's so good! Delicious!

00:09:36.493 --> 00:09:38.328 align:middle
[ELMA] What the heck
are you doing here, Tohru?!

00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:39.496 align:middle
You're the culprit!

00:09:39.579 --> 00:09:40.914 align:middle
[ELMA]
What are you talking about?!

00:09:40.997 --> 00:09:42.999 align:middle
The news. They mentioned a
mountain that was damaged.

00:09:43.083 --> 00:09:44.709 align:middle
[ELMA grunting]

00:09:44.793 --> 00:09:48.129 align:middle
Oh, yeah. I was gonna ask you
about the same thing.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:49.631 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
You're saying it wasn't you?

00:09:49.714 --> 00:09:51.758 align:middle
[ELMA]
No, I just assumed it was Tohru.

00:09:51.841 --> 00:09:53.134 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Well, it wasn't!

00:09:53.218 --> 00:09:54.386 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Hold on.
Then, that means it had to be

00:09:54.469 --> 00:09:56.429 align:middle
some other dragon
that we don't know.

00:09:56.513 --> 00:09:58.181 align:middle
There aren't that many
dragons powerful enough

00:09:58.264 --> 00:10:00.058 align:middle
to break my barrier.

00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:01.476 align:middle
Then who could it be?

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:02.602 align:middle
It was me.

00:10:02.686 --> 00:10:04.062 align:middle
[GROUP grunts]

00:10:11.653 --> 00:10:12.570 align:middle
Hi.

00:10:12.654 --> 00:10:14.906 align:middle
[chuckles]

00:10:14.989 --> 00:10:16.282 align:middle
Ilulu.

00:10:16.366 --> 00:10:17.575 align:middle
[ELMA grunts]

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.122 align:middle
[ILULU]
What a pretty city this is.

00:10:22.205 --> 00:10:25.709 align:middle
There's chatter and
laughter everywhere.

00:10:25.792 --> 00:10:27.627 align:middle
With so many people around,
you could be indulging

00:10:27.711 --> 00:10:29.462 align:middle
in mass destruction!

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.882 align:middle
Yet, here you are, a chaos
dragon, chummy with them.

00:10:32.966 --> 00:10:34.801 align:middle
I was watching because
I was a little curious,

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:38.221 align:middle
and I see what's going on.
I'm not amused.

00:10:38.304 --> 00:10:41.224 align:middle
What I'm trying to say is,
you're an enemy now!

00:10:41.307 --> 00:10:45.478 align:middle
[BOTH grunting]

00:10:45.562 --> 00:10:48.231 align:middle
Ha--Hngh!

00:10:48.314 --> 00:10:50.358 align:middle
--Who is that?
--Ilulu.

00:10:50.442 --> 00:10:52.444 align:middle
She's with the most radical wing
of the chaos faction

00:10:52.527 --> 00:10:54.696 align:middle
and loves destruction.

00:10:54.779 --> 00:10:57.073 align:middle
I'm sure she
followed Tohru here.

00:10:57.157 --> 00:10:58.324 align:middle
You see what I mean?

00:10:58.408 --> 00:11:00.994 align:middle
She clearly came here
to destroy this world.

00:11:01.077 --> 00:11:03.997 align:middle
I see, but I trust that Tohru
will do something about her.

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.248 align:middle
[ELMA]
Miss Kobayashi,

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:07.834 align:middle
Ilulu's might is only
slightly below Tohru's.

00:11:07.917 --> 00:11:08.918 align:middle
If the two of them fight,

00:11:09.002 --> 00:11:10.503 align:middle
they'll destroy
this whole region.

00:11:10.587 --> 00:11:12.756 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] I sure she'll do
something about that, too.

00:11:12.839 --> 00:11:14.632 align:middle
[ELMA] You really believe
in Tohru, huh?

00:11:14.716 --> 00:11:18.803 align:middle
Well, it's not like that.
I have no choice.

00:11:18.887 --> 00:11:20.180 align:middle
So, I'm embracing it.

00:11:20.263 --> 00:11:21.639 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Yah!

00:11:22.682 --> 00:11:24.934 align:middle
Destruction isn't
permitted in this world.

00:11:25.018 --> 00:11:28.229 align:middle
Yeah, what's your point?
I'm in the chaos faction, too.

00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:31.399 align:middle
If you can't abide by the rules,
I'll have to send you home.

00:11:31.483 --> 00:11:33.526 align:middle
I'm more than happy
to fight with you.

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.778 align:middle
[snarls]

00:11:34.861 --> 00:11:37.614 align:middle
Attacks like that
will have no effect on me.

00:11:42.369 --> 00:11:43.578 align:middle
[ILULU chuckles]

00:11:45.205 --> 00:11:46.664 align:middle
[TOHRU]
No! The city!

00:11:52.212 --> 00:11:53.922 align:middle
Hot!

00:11:54.005 --> 00:11:55.298 align:middle
[ILULU chuckles]

00:11:55.382 --> 00:11:56.758 align:middle
[TOHRU screams]

00:11:56.841 --> 00:11:58.635 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I can't tell. Is she struggling?

00:11:58.718 --> 00:12:00.720 align:middle
[ELMA] Tohru's trying to
protect the city while fighting,

00:12:00.804 --> 00:12:02.681 align:middle
so she's at a disadvantage.

00:12:03.598 --> 00:12:05.850 align:middle
Are you saying you're
not gonna help her?

00:12:05.934 --> 00:12:08.812 align:middle
I can't. I'm with
the harmony faction.

00:12:08.895 --> 00:12:10.855 align:middle
Normally, Tohru and I
would be enemies.

00:12:10.939 --> 00:12:12.190 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:13.900 align:middle
[ELMA] I've put up a barrier
to keep humans away,

00:12:13.983 --> 00:12:16.111 align:middle
but that's just
to avoid trouble.

00:12:16.194 --> 00:12:17.612 align:middle
What about the others?

00:12:17.696 --> 00:12:19.781 align:middle
If we asked Sir Fafnir, he would
say she needs to clean up

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:21.908 align:middle
her own mess.

00:12:21.991 --> 00:12:23.868 align:middle
Lady Lucoa is with
the spectator faction,

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:27.205 align:middle
so she doesn't do intervention,
and Kanna's not strong enough.

00:12:27.288 --> 00:12:30.250 align:middle
If she defeats Tohru,
I'll be permitted to fight.

00:12:30.333 --> 00:12:32.919 align:middle
Protecting you and the city
aligns with the Harmony faction.

00:12:33.003 --> 00:12:34.671 align:middle
But then, she'd be...

00:12:34.754 --> 00:12:36.923 align:middle
[ELMA]
Mm...

00:12:37.007 --> 00:12:39.175 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI gasps]

00:12:39.259 --> 00:12:40.385 align:middle
[BOTH grunting]

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:41.761 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
What good is believing in her...

00:12:41.845 --> 00:12:43.346 align:middle
...if it doesn't
give her strength?

00:12:43.430 --> 00:12:46.391 align:middle
It's the same as observing
and doing nothing.

00:12:46.474 --> 00:12:48.768 align:middle
But... what else can I...

00:12:48.852 --> 00:12:51.521 align:middle
[gasps]
Elma!

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.106 align:middle
Please don't try.

00:12:53.189 --> 00:12:55.275 align:middle
I know you want me to jump in
and help Tohru, but I cannot.

00:12:55.358 --> 00:12:56.651 align:middle
Pudding!

00:12:56.735 --> 00:12:58.194 align:middle
I know what you're trying
to do and you can't just

00:12:58.278 --> 00:12:59.279 align:middle
--buy me off with--
--[KOBAYASHI] Cream puffs!

--Coffee jelly!

Anything sweet you can think of!

[ELMA squeals]

[TOHRU groaning]

00:13:15.795 --> 00:13:16.921 align:middle
[ILULU]
Hah!

00:13:17.005 --> 00:13:19.174 align:middle

Ow...

00:13:23.219 --> 00:13:24.971 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm.

00:13:25.055 --> 00:13:26.222 align:middle
Mm-hmm.

00:13:26.306 --> 00:13:28.975 align:middle
I just hit you with 30
shots of flaming acid.

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:32.228 align:middle
That's on top of several nice
swipes with my claws.

00:13:32.312 --> 00:13:35.315 align:middle
And you gave it an "ow"?
Then, I'm stumped.

00:13:35.398 --> 00:13:37.525 align:middle
I can't think of
a solid way to kill you.

00:13:37.609 --> 00:13:39.110 align:middle
--[TOHRU] Me, neither.
--Ah?

00:13:39.194 --> 00:13:42.197 align:middle
If I go all out with an attack,
the city will be destroyed.

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.241 align:middle
But I know there's no way
to defeat you otherwise.

00:13:45.325 --> 00:13:48.745 align:middle
Your attacks are starting to
get really annoying as well!

00:13:48.828 --> 00:13:51.873 align:middle
But I can't do it!
I have to protect the city!

00:13:51.956 --> 00:13:56.002 align:middle
I feel like exploding and
taking everything with me.

00:13:56.086 --> 00:13:58.004 align:middle
You're bluffing.

00:13:58.088 --> 00:13:59.839 align:middle
--[TOHRU gasps]
--[KOBAYASHI] Tohru!

00:13:59.923 --> 00:14:01.966 align:middle
Elma was awesome
and put up a barrier!

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.594 align:middle
Only because Miss Kobayashi
decided to bribe me!

00:14:04.678 --> 00:14:05.929 align:middle
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:14:07.764 --> 00:14:10.350 align:middle
[ILULU]
That's disgusting.

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.143 align:middle
Relying on humans?

00:14:12.227 --> 00:14:15.855 align:middle
Yeah, well, so what?
We're just getting started!

00:14:15.939 --> 00:14:19.359 align:middle
Now to destroy this world
with my true form!

00:14:21.861 --> 00:14:24.531 align:middle

[sighs]

00:14:41.172 --> 00:14:43.425 align:middle
[TOHRU]
That was a close call.

00:14:43.508 --> 00:14:45.969 align:middle
I didn't take much damage.

00:14:46.052 --> 00:14:49.180 align:middle
But I nearly forgot I had
to protect the city, too.

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.142 align:middle
[TOHRU] For a moment I thought
about letting everyone else

00:14:52.225 --> 00:14:56.187 align:middle
in this world die,
except Miss Kobayashi.

00:14:56.271 --> 00:14:59.315 align:middle
But then I wouldn't be able
to stay here with her.

[TOHRU]
Mm! Yeah.

00:15:26.217 --> 00:15:28.636 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I will fight as hard as I must.

00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.181 align:middle
If it means staying
with Miss Kobayashi,

00:15:31.264 --> 00:15:34.809 align:middle
I can destroy any obstacles
that stand in my way.

[ILULU grunts]

00:15:43.777 --> 00:15:45.987 align:middle
That human back there...

00:15:46.071 --> 00:15:49.824 align:middle
She got Elma involved
and saved Tohru.

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.868 align:middle
Humans are our enemies.

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:55.622 align:middle
That's what we
were taught, but...

00:15:55.705 --> 00:15:57.874 align:middle
...there's something
about that one.

00:15:57.957 --> 00:16:00.043 align:middle
I want to know more.

00:16:04.839 --> 00:16:06.424 align:middle
Me? Me, who?

00:16:06.508 --> 00:16:10.053 align:middle
Oh, yeah! Oh. Hmm.

00:16:10.136 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle

By today? Two million?

Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmm.
Hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm!

00:16:27.737 --> 00:16:29.948 align:middle
Oh, that's terrible.

[ILULU groans]

00:16:40.208 --> 00:16:44.629 align:middle
[sighs] It was harder to get
that gate open than I expected.

00:16:44.713 --> 00:16:48.508 align:middle
I'm surprised Tohru can easily
pull off something so draining.

00:16:50.427 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle
The last train...

00:16:51.803 --> 00:16:53.972 align:middle
I guess I could have Tohru
come pick me up instead,

00:16:54.055 --> 00:16:55.890 align:middle
but she's probably tired. Or--

00:16:55.974 --> 00:16:57.434 align:middle
[gasps]
It's you.

I want to know why you
choose to live with a dragon.

00:17:02.731 --> 00:17:05.150 align:middle
Because Tohru decided
she wanted to stay in my life.

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.819 align:middle
Believe me, I didn't
try to convince her.

00:17:07.902 --> 00:17:09.487 align:middle
[ILULU]
Aren't you afraid?

00:17:09.571 --> 00:17:11.197 align:middle
Fear me, human!

00:17:11.281 --> 00:17:14.325 align:middle
Hard to be afraid of her when
she's so cute most of the time.

00:17:14.409 --> 00:17:15.410 align:middle
[ILULU]
Oh.

00:17:17.037 --> 00:17:19.080 align:middle
--So she turns you on?
--Uh?

00:17:19.164 --> 00:17:21.583 align:middle
The reason you're not afraid
of Tohru in her human form

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:23.543 align:middle
is because you're
in love with her.

00:17:23.626 --> 00:17:27.297 align:middle
Huh?! Of course not!
What are you talking about?!

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.841 align:middle
What a powerful denial.
Suspicious...

00:17:29.924 --> 00:17:31.343 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
That's not it!

00:17:31.426 --> 00:17:33.053 align:middle
[ILULU]
Then...

00:17:33.136 --> 00:17:34.054 align:middle
Waugh!

00:17:34.137 --> 00:17:35.555 align:middle
[ILULU chuckles]

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:38.099 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
What is this?

00:17:38.183 --> 00:17:39.476 align:middle
Wow...

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle
[ILULU] Well? You're only
human in the end. Right?

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.314 align:middle
You can't resist your desires.

00:17:44.397 --> 00:17:46.983 align:middle
Go ahead and let your pitiful
male instincts run wild

00:17:47.067 --> 00:17:49.736 align:middle
and free for once!
You want to be loved, don't you?

00:17:49.819 --> 00:17:52.864 align:middle
Tonight, you can finally
unleash your lustful longings!

00:17:52.947 --> 00:17:55.867 align:middle
Go on. Do it. Do it!

00:17:55.950 --> 00:17:58.495 align:middle
Get your tits out of my face!
I'm a woman!

00:17:58.578 --> 00:18:01.164 align:middle
Cut the crap, okay?!
Those lumps of flesh do nothing

00:18:01.247 --> 00:18:05.293 align:middle
but unleash flames of rage and
resentment anytime I see them!

00:18:05.377 --> 00:18:07.462 align:middle
Oh no, the last train's
about to leave!

00:18:07.545 --> 00:18:08.838 align:middle
[ILULU]
Wait! Come back!

00:18:08.922 --> 00:18:10.840 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI panting]

00:18:10.924 --> 00:18:12.467 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER 201A] Please do not
rush to board the train

00:18:12.550 --> 00:18:14.219 align:middle
--while doors are closing.
--[ILULU growls]

00:18:20.058 --> 00:18:21.518 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm...

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.816 align:middle
Well, what? Haven't you
caused enough commotion?

00:18:27.899 --> 00:18:31.695 align:middle
[ILULU growls]
I cannot accept you.

00:18:31.778 --> 00:18:33.029 align:middle
Huh?

00:18:33.113 --> 00:18:36.241 align:middle
Humans and dragons are
never permitted to coexist.

00:18:36.324 --> 00:18:37.575 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm.

00:18:37.659 --> 00:18:39.994 align:middle
When together, their
differences cause suffering.

00:18:40.078 --> 00:18:42.831 align:middle
As that suffering grows,
it breeds hatred.

00:18:42.914 --> 00:18:46.918 align:middle
Respect turns to envy
and eventually creates pain.

00:18:48.294 --> 00:18:50.922 align:middle
What Tohru feels for you
is not what you think.

00:18:51.006 --> 00:18:53.883 align:middle
It's simply curiosity.

00:18:53.967 --> 00:18:55.719 align:middle
And when that
eventually runs out...

00:18:55.802 --> 00:18:58.471 align:middle
--[KOBAYASHI snoring]
--Uh? Wake up!

00:18:58.555 --> 00:19:02.726 align:middle
Huh? Everything's fine.
I was listening. I promise.

00:19:02.809 --> 00:19:04.185 align:middle
You liar!

00:19:04.269 --> 00:19:05.812 align:middle
You were talking about the
differences between species

00:19:05.895 --> 00:19:09.774 align:middle
or something. You can't accept
me and we shouldn't coexist.

00:19:09.858 --> 00:19:11.985 align:middle
So is there anything
a lowly human like myself

00:19:12.068 --> 00:19:13.445 align:middle
can do to help you?

00:19:13.528 --> 00:19:15.780 align:middle
Correct your understanding!

00:19:15.864 --> 00:19:19.576 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm.
Then please allow me to borrow

00:19:19.659 --> 00:19:21.828 align:middle
your own words to make
an important point.

00:19:21.911 --> 00:19:23.288 align:middle
[ILULU grunts]

00:19:23.371 --> 00:19:25.165 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] When we embrace
our differences and learn

00:19:25.248 --> 00:19:27.500 align:middle
to enjoy them, it breeds love.

00:19:27.584 --> 00:19:31.838 align:middle
Respect is joined by trust
and eventually creates a bond.

00:19:31.921 --> 00:19:34.591 align:middle
I never thought I would ever say
that about my life with Tohru,

00:19:34.674 --> 00:19:36.134 align:middle
but it's completely true.

00:19:36.217 --> 00:19:38.053 align:middle
That's just a convenient
interpretation!

00:19:38.136 --> 00:19:39.721 align:middle
There are still tragedies, too!

00:19:39.804 --> 00:19:43.266 align:middle
You're glossing over truth
with a bunch of pretty words!

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:44.517 align:middle
Yeah, you're right.

00:19:44.601 --> 00:19:45.727 align:middle
Uh?

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:47.270 align:middle
There are times we fight
and hurt each other,

00:19:47.354 --> 00:19:49.564 align:middle
but I try not to think
about it too much.

00:19:49.647 --> 00:19:51.441 align:middle
Some might say
I'm repressing anger,

00:19:51.524 --> 00:19:53.860 align:middle
but I call it choosing battles.

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:56.321 align:middle
Even if I don't always
understand her feelings,

00:19:56.404 --> 00:19:59.908 align:middle
I do what I can to respect them.
And we manage.

00:19:59.991 --> 00:20:01.868 align:middle
I guess it's just the way I am.

00:20:01.951 --> 00:20:04.120 align:middle
Is that how you
humans really think?

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:08.333 align:middle
No, but it is the way
that I personally think.

00:20:08.416 --> 00:20:10.293 align:middle
Wouldn't you agree that
there's a distinction between

00:20:10.377 --> 00:20:12.837 align:middle
the way you and other dragons
in your realm see things?

00:20:12.921 --> 00:20:15.632 align:middle
[ILULU grunts]
No, but there's no need to.

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.008 align:middle
We're the same.

00:20:17.092 --> 00:20:19.219 align:middle
Really? But what about the
dragon who came up with

00:20:19.302 --> 00:20:22.889 align:middle
these absolute guidelines for
how a dragon should think?

00:20:22.972 --> 00:20:25.058 align:middle
It wasn't you, was it?

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:26.685 align:middle
[ILULU gasps]

00:20:29.145 --> 00:20:30.939 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI sighs]

00:20:35.652 --> 00:20:36.986 align:middle
[ILULU]
Hmm?

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:41.908 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI snoring softly]

00:20:41.991 --> 00:20:43.660 align:middle
[ILULU growls]

00:20:43.743 --> 00:20:46.996 align:middle
You can spout pretty words,
but you're still a human.

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:49.624 align:middle
It didn't work because
you're a female.

00:20:53.253 --> 00:20:54.587 align:middle
[train door ringing]

00:20:54.671 --> 00:20:56.423 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI groans]
Huh...?

00:20:56.506 --> 00:20:57.632 align:middle
Whoa!

00:20:59.926 --> 00:21:02.220 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I guess Ilulu left?

00:21:02.303 --> 00:21:03.805 align:middle
[groans]

00:21:08.059 --> 00:21:09.436 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh?

00:21:11.104 --> 00:21:13.106 align:middle
You gotta be kidding me!

00:21:20.113 --> 00:21:21.448 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Hmm?

00:21:36.629 --> 00:21:37.756 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Hmm...?

00:21:39.466 --> 00:21:44.846 align:middle
[FAFNIR growling]

00:21:47.974 --> 00:21:52.604 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Hmm? Hmm? Faf-kun?

00:21:52.687 --> 00:21:56.441 align:middle
[screams] The fate of mankind!
It's in jeopardy!

00:23:29.951 --> 00:23:32.454 align:middle
[TOHRU] Miss Kobayashi!
Aren't you excited?

00:23:32.537 --> 00:23:35.331 align:middle
The love story of me and you
is finally continuing!

00:23:35.415 --> 00:23:37.417 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Is it?
Wasn't there a new dragon?

00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:38.752 align:middle
[TOHRU]
She won't show up anymore.

00:23:38.835 --> 00:23:40.337 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
That's not true.

00:23:42.714 --> 00:23:45.550 align:middle
