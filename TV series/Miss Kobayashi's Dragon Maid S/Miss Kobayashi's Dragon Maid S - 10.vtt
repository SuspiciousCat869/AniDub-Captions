Huh? I know that voice.

00:10:42.017 --> 00:10:43.143 align:middle
[KANNA]
Let's go home.

00:10:43.226 --> 00:10:45.729 align:middle
[CHLOE]
Wait... Kanna?

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:49.899 align:middle
[CHLOE laughs]

00:10:52.986 --> 00:10:54.154 align:middle
[CHLOE]
Amazing!

00:10:54.237 --> 00:10:56.656 align:middle
Am I dreaming right now?

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:58.825 align:middle
Or maybe those jerks
actually killed me?

00:10:58.908 --> 00:11:01.619 align:middle
Are we flying around
Heaven, Kanna?

00:11:01.703 --> 00:11:04.914 align:middle
[KANNA] It's not a dream.
Can you tell me where you live?

00:11:04.998 --> 00:11:07.667 align:middle
[CHLOE] I'm in Minnesota,
so probably there?

00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:10.128 align:middle
It's just past those big lakes.

00:11:10.211 --> 00:11:12.130 align:middle
[KANNA]
I see 'em.

00:11:12.213 --> 00:11:15.550 align:middle
[CHLOE]
You're so soft and so warm.

00:11:17.218 --> 00:11:22.599 align:middle
I lied to you. I ran away.
They didn't kidnap me.

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.976 align:middle
[KANNA]
You, too?

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:26.144 align:middle
[CHLOE]
Yeah.

00:11:26.227 --> 00:11:27.937 align:middle
I had a fight with my papa.

00:11:28.021 --> 00:11:31.775 align:middle
I need to apologize,
but I don't know what to say.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:35.320 align:middle
[KANNA]
Me neither.

00:11:35.403 --> 00:11:37.530 align:middle
But...

00:11:37.614 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle
If someone's still there
after things get bad...

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:44.746 align:middle
[KANNA] ...even when
you get mad at them...

00:11:47.540 --> 00:11:50.418 align:middle
[KANNA] ...and say mean things
like you hate them...

00:11:52.379 --> 00:11:58.009 align:middle
[KANNA] If they're somebody who
stays, I'm sure it'll be okay.

00:11:58.093 --> 00:12:00.804 align:middle
[CHLOE]
Yeah...

00:12:00.887 --> 00:12:03.807 align:middle
Are you ready
to go home too, Kanna?

00:12:03.890 --> 00:12:04.808 align:middle
[KANNA]
Yeah.

00:12:04.891 --> 00:12:06.393 align:middle
[CHLOE]
Will I see you again?

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:09.938 align:middle
[KANNA] If you want,
I'll give you my address.

00:12:10.021 --> 00:12:11.648 align:middle
[CHLOE]
You have an address?

00:12:26.705 --> 00:12:29.541 align:middle
[TOHRU] Oh, hi. And where
have you been all this time?

00:12:29.624 --> 00:12:31.376 align:middle

Lady Tohru!

00:12:31.459 --> 00:12:32.669 align:middle
I'm so sorry...

00:12:32.752 --> 00:12:34.629 align:middle
[TOHRU sighs]
Well, I'm not the one

00:12:34.713 --> 00:12:36.506 align:middle
you should be apologizing to.

00:12:36.589 --> 00:12:38.174 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm.

00:12:38.258 --> 00:12:41.219 align:middle
I know you're right.
Where's Kobayashi?

[KOBAYASHI snoring]

00:12:53.523 --> 00:12:54.816 align:middle
[TOHRU] Have you decided
what you're going to say

00:12:54.899 --> 00:12:56.860 align:middle
when she wakes up?

00:12:56.943 --> 00:12:58.069 align:middle
[KANNA]
No idea...

00:12:58.153 --> 00:13:00.530 align:middle
[TOHRU] Miss Kobayashi
said the same thing.

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:17.714 align:middle
I was watching you
the whole time.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.049 align:middle
Oh...

00:13:25.638 --> 00:13:27.974 align:middle
[ILULU]
Okay, I'm heading out!

00:13:28.058 --> 00:13:29.684 align:middle

Mm. Be safe out there.

See you later, Miss Kobayashi!

00:13:33.521 --> 00:13:35.065 align:middle
I'm off to work now!

00:13:35.148 --> 00:13:37.484 align:middle

Okay, take care!

00:13:40.111 --> 00:13:41.696 align:middle

Enjoy fresh fish...

00:13:43.031 --> 00:13:45.075 align:middle
Oh. Hey, Kanna,
you're awake.

00:13:45.158 --> 00:13:46.493 align:middle
[KANNA]
Good morning.

00:13:46.576 --> 00:13:48.078 align:middle
Morning.

00:13:48.161 --> 00:13:50.497 align:middle
[KANNA] Kobayashi,
are you off work today?

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:51.998 align:middle
Yes, good night.

[KANNA]
Oh.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.337 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] I was super
busy until yesterday.

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:58.380 align:middle
[KANNA]
Death march style?

00:13:58.463 --> 00:14:00.256 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Super death march style.

00:14:11.101 --> 00:14:14.062 align:middle
[ANNOUNCER 210A] Next up,
we have Komura in Kanazawa.

00:14:14.145 --> 00:14:16.648 align:middle
[KOMURA] Hello, friends! Komura
here. Today, we're trying...

00:14:16.731 --> 00:14:18.858 align:middle
Where are Lady Tohru and Ilulu?

Are you just going to laze
around the house all day long?

00:14:29.911 --> 00:14:33.540 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm. I'm gonna be super lazy.

00:14:33.623 --> 00:14:36.584 align:middle
Might be a good day for you
to go play with Saikawa.

00:14:36.668 --> 00:14:38.920 align:middle
[KANNA] I can't.
Saikawa said she's going on

00:14:39.004 --> 00:14:41.631 align:middle
a family vacation today.

00:14:41.715 --> 00:14:44.342 align:middle
Looks like a boring day
for you, then.

00:14:44.426 --> 00:14:46.344 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm.

00:14:46.428 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.932 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm.

00:14:53.226 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle
Kobayashi, can I
have a watermelon?

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:58.356 align:middle
Huh? I didn't hear them
mention watermelon.

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.567 align:middle
[KANNA] No, Lady Tohru
bought one yesterday.

Wow, you're very observant.

00:15:02.193 --> 00:15:04.320 align:middle

this afternoon.

Okay, I'll get it started.

Do you think you could go
downstairs and check the mailbox

for me, pretty please?

Wow, air mail, huh?

00:16:05.090 --> 00:16:06.925 align:middle
I wonder if it's from that new
friend you said you made

00:16:07.008 --> 00:16:08.927 align:middle
in New York the other day?

00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:10.804 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm. Oh, Chloe.

00:16:10.887 --> 00:16:13.390 align:middle
She says she wants to
come over and play with me.

00:16:13.473 --> 00:16:14.849 align:middle
Is it okay if she
stays for a bit?

00:16:14.933 --> 00:16:16.518 align:middle

Sure. Of course!

we only have milk.

It's weird that I've lived here
so long and never noticed it.

Is it some kind of character?

It's Mr. Quiet.
