Whirly, swirly, swirly, swirly.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:17.350 align:middle
Too much polyglutamic acid.

00:00:17.434 --> 00:00:20.854 align:middle
There we go. Now it's broken
up into glutamic acid.

Is it ready yet?

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:25.650 align:middle
[KANNA]
Need more.

--[door clicks]
--[gasps] Oh, hi!

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.903 align:middle
Good morning to you!

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:30.155 align:middle
Morning, Kobayashi.

00:00:30.238 --> 00:00:31.865 align:middle
--Morning!
--Hey.

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:36.036 align:middle
Okra miso soup!
Great way to kick off summer!

00:00:36.119 --> 00:00:38.121 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm. Thanks for the food.

00:00:38.204 --> 00:00:39.414 align:middle
[ILULU] Take said there's
something called

00:00:39.497 --> 00:00:42.625 align:middle
"a summer festival" coming up.
It sounds fun.

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:46.046 align:middle
[KANNA] Mm-hmm. I told
Saikawa I'd go with her.

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:47.422 align:middle
[ILULU]
What do you do there?

00:00:47.505 --> 00:00:49.632 align:middle
[KANNA] I heard they open up
lots and lots of stalls

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:50.717 align:middle
--and stuff!

Can I ask something?

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:40.266 align:middle
What do you do
when relationships

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.976 align:middle
start getting serious?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.813 align:middle
Huh. Well, lemme think...

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:49.693 align:middle
I guess I just go with it.
I mean, what else can you do?

00:01:49.776 --> 00:01:51.528 align:middle
Yeah, I get that.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.283 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I definitely get that.

00:02:03.957 --> 00:02:05.333 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Hey, it's
the festival they were

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:07.794 align:middle
talking about this morning.

00:02:07.877 --> 00:02:12.465 align:middle
I guess I'll go with Tohru.
Ugh, do we have to get yukatas?

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.759 align:middle
She can wear one. I'm out.

00:02:16.594 --> 00:02:18.680 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
They're decorating already?

00:02:21.307 --> 00:02:24.352 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Tohru? What the...?

00:02:24.436 --> 00:02:26.855 align:middle
[TOHRU] Some people from the
shopping district needed help.

00:02:26.938 --> 00:02:29.858 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Wow. They really
have a lot of faith in you.

00:02:29.941 --> 00:02:31.484 align:middle
[TOHRU] Well, it's a huge
pain in the tail--

00:02:31.568 --> 00:02:33.403 align:middle
even if it is for the festival.

00:02:33.486 --> 00:02:35.864 align:middle
You looked like you were
having so much fun.

00:02:35.947 --> 00:02:38.158 align:middle
[TOHRU] Because I knew
you'd pass by at any moment!

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.118 align:middle
The thought of you walking
under the lights I hung up

00:02:40.201 --> 00:02:42.203 align:middle
makes me tingle all over!

00:02:42.287 --> 00:02:45.498 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Magical. Hey are you
up to anything on that day?

00:02:45.582 --> 00:02:47.417 align:middle
Apparently, the girls from
the maid café will have

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.170 align:middle
a stall there, so I'll
probably go help them out.

00:02:50.253 --> 00:02:52.797 align:middle
Oh, cool.

00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:54.924 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay, then. Wow.

00:02:55.008 --> 00:02:57.844 align:middle
She seems to be
adapting quite well.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:02:59.888 align:middle
She's taking initiative
to truly get to know

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:01.514 align:middle
the people in our town.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:03.933 align:middle
Working with them to
build genuine connections

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:06.227 align:middle
and really striving
to earn their trust.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.981 align:middle
I guess that's easy to do when
you have the power of a dragon.

00:03:10.065 --> 00:03:13.777 align:middle
She's changed.
But... in a good way, I think.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.404 align:middle
I haven't. I'm the same.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:19.866 align:middle
Which makes me wonder if I'm
even on her level at this point.

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:22.369 align:middle
Why does she even like me?

00:03:22.452 --> 00:03:25.372 align:middle
Whatever. I guess
it's silly to compare.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:27.374 align:middle
She's started bothering
me less and less,

00:03:27.457 --> 00:03:31.044 align:middle
and I'm feeling more
and more... lonely.

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:34.756 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Well, that's
a thought that will never see

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.466 align:middle
the light of day.

00:03:48.478 --> 00:03:50.313 align:middle
Kobayashi, can I have this one?

00:03:50.397 --> 00:03:52.273 align:middle
Yeah, it's so cute!

00:03:52.357 --> 00:03:53.733 align:middle
Oh, yay!

00:03:53.817 --> 00:03:55.944 align:middle
[ILULU] Kobayashi!
What do you think of this?

00:03:56.027 --> 00:03:58.279 align:middle
I think it would look
adorable on you!

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.531 align:middle
Thank you.

00:03:59.614 --> 00:04:01.991 align:middle
What about yours?
Aren't you gonna wear one?

00:04:02.075 --> 00:04:04.244 align:middle
Yeah, no. I'm actually good.

00:04:04.327 --> 00:04:05.370 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi!

00:04:05.453 --> 00:04:07.122 align:middle
Which one of these
do you like best?

00:04:07.205 --> 00:04:09.666 align:middle
I dunno. Whichever one you
could see yourself wearing.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.292 align:middle
Aw, come on,
don't ruin this for me!

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:12.877 align:middle
I want you to choose, please?

00:04:12.961 --> 00:04:14.921 align:middle
Ugh... 'Kay, fine.

Eenie meenie miney mo,
ask God if he knows,

00:04:17.674 --> 00:04:20.719 align:middle
he put a rose on your nose,
and picked this one.

00:04:20.802 --> 00:04:22.387 align:middle
This one.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.055 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Ugh...

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.349 align:middle
I'll never do anything
that bastard says!

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:27.517 align:middle
I pick this one!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.601 align:middle
Great.

I just love festivals so much!

I wonder what they
were like in your world?

Let me think...

00:04:47.328 --> 00:04:49.581 align:middle
There was whole roasted pig,
a baked chicken...

00:04:49.664 --> 00:04:52.292 align:middle

of food she ate there.

Look! It's Lady Tohru!

café's specialty omurice!

Ah! Hi, Kanna! You came by.

00:05:02.635 --> 00:05:04.888 align:middle
Why are you wearing that
festival uniform instead of

00:05:04.971 --> 00:05:06.514 align:middle
your own maid outfit?

00:05:06.598 --> 00:05:09.768 align:middle

so hard to move around in!

00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:11.561 align:middle

You have omurice?!
I want one, too!

go wait in line.

I can't! If I line up here,

00:05:24.407 --> 00:05:25.867 align:middle
I might miss out on
eating the grilled corn

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.202 align:middle
and the grilled squid!

00:05:27.285 --> 00:05:29.037 align:middle
And the okonomiyaki,
candied apples,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.331 align:middle
--and all kinds of food I love!
--You're being ridiculous.

when I come home.

Sure.

[LUCOA] Though they are
a little different here.

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:17.585 align:middle
In our world many
festivals were held

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:19.713 align:middle
to celebrate a lot
of different gods.

00:06:19.796 --> 00:06:21.297 align:middle
Oh, wow.

00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:23.466 align:middle
No one really celebrates their
religion around here anymore.

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.343 align:middle
Celebrating the gods
made security tight,

00:06:25.427 --> 00:06:27.512 align:middle
which is why the dragons
couldn't get close.

00:06:27.595 --> 00:06:29.639 align:middle
[LUCOA] Oh, yeah.
In the big country up north,

00:06:29.723 --> 00:06:32.267 align:middle
they held a huge festival
in the spring every year.

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:35.020 align:middle
It was so hard to get
through there that season!

00:06:35.103 --> 00:06:36.396 align:middle
[LUCOA] The gods
actually came down...

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.232 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Blah, blah, blah.
That's all I can hear.

00:06:39.315 --> 00:06:41.067 align:middle
I mean, I like hearing
about other worlds,

00:06:41.151 --> 00:06:44.571 align:middle
but it also makes me
feel kind of invisible.

00:06:44.654 --> 00:06:47.032 align:middle

we're little old ladies

not really a kid,

once in a while, bang--

00:07:37.582 --> 00:07:39.918 align:middle

grown up than me.

I had to be an adult

and that I could never
go back to being a kid.

version of you is still there.

permission is all it takes,

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.715 align:middle
Wow. Perv.
[laughs]

00:08:26.798 --> 00:08:28.216 align:middle
[TAKETO]
That doesn't count, jerk!

00:08:28.299 --> 00:08:29.592 align:middle
[LUCOA] I think those
who knew the old you

00:08:29.676 --> 00:08:32.721 align:middle
would be so surprised
to see you now.

00:08:32.804 --> 00:08:33.888 align:middle
You're one to talk.

00:08:33.972 --> 00:08:35.890 align:middle
Since when do goddesses
become familiars?

00:08:35.974 --> 00:08:38.977 align:middle
Okay, sure, ex-goddess,
but you know what I mean.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.813 align:middle
I simply do what I want
just like I always have.

00:08:41.896 --> 00:08:43.690 align:middle
If you're not having fun,
you're not living.

00:08:43.773 --> 00:08:45.400 align:middle
[ELMA]
Yeah, true.

00:08:45.483 --> 00:08:47.944 align:middle
So do you have
feelings for Lucoa?

00:08:48.028 --> 00:08:49.320 align:middle
Where'd that come from?!

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:51.656 align:middle
Who knows? But for example...

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.534 align:middle
What if Lucoa was hanging all
over your friends or classmates

00:08:54.617 --> 00:08:56.953 align:middle
and there was nothing you
could do but watch them.

00:08:57.037 --> 00:08:59.289 align:middle
What would be going through
your mind if that happened?

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:01.958 align:middle
[gasps, whimpers]

00:09:04.169 --> 00:09:06.046 align:middle
Hey, I'm sorry.
You don't have to say anything.

00:09:06.129 --> 00:09:08.423 align:middle
I think I get it.

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:09.549 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
That's what I thought.

00:09:09.632 --> 00:09:11.926 align:middle
He'd be horrifically
uncomfortable.

00:09:13.678 --> 00:09:14.679 align:middle
Ah.

00:09:14.763 --> 00:09:16.931 align:middle
[ELMA]
Hm? Wait, where are you going?

00:09:17.015 --> 00:09:18.641 align:middle
I stayed for an hour.

00:09:22.896 --> 00:09:24.564 align:middle
Ah. Hi! Great.

00:09:24.647 --> 00:09:27.359 align:middle
I was just about to look
for you, Miss Kobayashi.

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:29.027 align:middle
Oh, you look good in that one!

00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:31.654 align:middle
Aw, thank you so much!

00:09:31.738 --> 00:09:33.281 align:middle
Is everyone over there?

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:38.328 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey.

00:09:40.372 --> 00:09:43.291 align:middle
Do you wanna take a walk?
Just you and me?

00:09:49.422 --> 00:09:51.716 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I would love to!

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:53.677 align:middle
What's gotten into you,
Miss Kobayashi?

00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:54.678 align:middle
[giggles]

00:09:54.761 --> 00:09:56.346 align:middle
Have you finally
come to appreciate

00:09:56.429 --> 00:09:59.349 align:middle
my unique and powerful charms?

00:09:59.432 --> 00:10:00.350 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm.

00:10:00.433 --> 00:10:01.893 align:middle
What?!

00:10:01.976 --> 00:10:03.311 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] You're one of
the strongest dragons,

00:10:03.395 --> 00:10:05.397 align:middle
even capable of
fighting the gods.

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:07.482 align:middle
But here, you're able to
make friends with anyone

00:10:07.565 --> 00:10:10.193 align:middle
whenever you feel like it.

00:10:10.276 --> 00:10:12.654 align:middle
Lately, I've been wondering,
after hearing everything

00:10:12.737 --> 00:10:14.656 align:middle
you've been through in the past,

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:18.743 align:middle
how am I worthy of being loved
by such an incredible person?

00:10:18.827 --> 00:10:21.204 align:middle
You've really been
thinking about that?

00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:24.749 align:middle
I suppose I did share a few
too many heavy stories.

00:10:24.833 --> 00:10:26.584 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Here you are
living with me like you never

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:28.962 align:middle
used to fear and hate humans.

00:10:29.045 --> 00:10:30.964 align:middle
You must be constantly
reminded of the many things

00:10:31.047 --> 00:10:32.674 align:middle
you've had to go through.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:36.177 align:middle
Oh, yeah, and you're also
a dragon, so there's that.

00:10:36.261 --> 00:10:39.097 align:middle
That's what keeps
repeating in my head.

00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:41.016 align:middle
So what?

00:10:42.225 --> 00:10:44.185 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Anyway, I guess it's fine.

00:10:44.269 --> 00:10:47.188 align:middle
Even though it's a pain
in the A sometimes.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:49.566 align:middle
[TOHRU whimpering]

00:10:49.649 --> 00:10:52.152 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Anyway, that's been my dilemma.

00:10:53.695 --> 00:10:55.196 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
But what about you, Tohru?

00:10:55.280 --> 00:10:56.281 align:middle
What's on your mind?

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.034 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Want to know about my feelings?

00:10:59.117 --> 00:11:02.662 align:middle
Uh... Well, you know
I love you, Miss Kobayashi.

00:11:02.746 --> 00:11:06.124 align:middle
I feel this way even though
you're just a human.

00:11:06.207 --> 00:11:08.335 align:middle
And even though
we are better than you.

00:11:08.418 --> 00:11:10.795 align:middle
Better than all humans, really.

00:11:10.879 --> 00:11:12.505 align:middle
I'm sure you're not surprised.

00:11:12.589 --> 00:11:16.051 align:middle
I am a dragon,
and I take pride in that.

00:11:16.134 --> 00:11:18.261 align:middle
I've been places where
you have to risk your life

00:11:18.345 --> 00:11:21.473 align:middle
and put everything on the line
to prove your superiority.

00:11:21.556 --> 00:11:23.099 align:middle
But my heart...

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:27.187 align:middle
When it came to love, I had no
idea how to prove my feelings.

00:11:27.270 --> 00:11:30.857 align:middle
I wondered, would it be easier
if I were a better fighter?

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.150 align:middle
Or smarter?

00:11:32.233 --> 00:11:34.444 align:middle
I wished I could
be those things.

00:11:34.527 --> 00:11:37.906 align:middle
I spent so much time trying
to convince everyone I was.

00:11:37.989 --> 00:11:40.533 align:middle
I guess I was
trying to be an adult.

00:11:40.617 --> 00:11:43.453 align:middle
But I realized I didn't
have to try to be anything.

00:11:43.536 --> 00:11:46.039 align:middle
It was okay to just be myself.

00:11:47.248 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle
And you're the one who helped me
realize that, Miss Kobayashi.

00:11:51.795 --> 00:11:54.464 align:middle
You're giving me
too much credit again.

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.424 align:middle
[TOHRU] I think it's a good sign
that you're so unaware

00:11:56.508 --> 00:11:58.301 align:middle
of it yourself.

00:11:58.385 --> 00:12:00.136 align:middle
Because it means you
were meant to save me

00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:02.097 align:middle
whether you wanted to or not.

00:12:03.515 --> 00:12:05.100 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi...

00:12:05.183 --> 00:12:07.268 align:middle
I love you so much!

00:12:11.106 --> 00:12:12.482 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI gasps]

00:12:13.817 --> 00:12:15.652 align:middle
From this moment on...

00:12:15.735 --> 00:12:18.405 align:middle
Forever and ever...

00:12:21.032 --> 00:12:23.868 align:middle
[giggles]

00:12:28.915 --> 00:12:31.710 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:12:44.347 --> 00:12:45.765 align:middle
Tohru.

00:12:45.849 --> 00:12:47.475 align:middle
Yes?

00:12:47.559 --> 00:12:48.476 align:middle
You're weird.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:50.228 align:middle
Wah?!

00:12:56.943 --> 00:13:00.030 align:middle
So did you take any cool
photos at the summer festival?

00:13:00.113 --> 00:13:01.865 align:middle
I did. Want to see?

00:13:10.081 --> 00:13:12.667 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Nice! Looks like
you had a great time!

00:13:12.751 --> 00:13:13.918 align:middle
We did.

00:13:21.426 --> 00:13:23.887 align:middle
Hey, you wanna look at flowers?

00:13:23.970 --> 00:13:25.388 align:middle
[slurps]

00:13:29.434 --> 00:13:32.395 align:middle
It is way too hot to be
outside all day, ma'am.

00:13:32.479 --> 00:13:36.066 align:middle
What if I said I know someone
whose flesh turns into flowers?

00:13:36.149 --> 00:13:37.317 align:middle
They gave me some,

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:40.278 align:middle
but it wouldn't be right
to enjoy them by myself.

00:13:40.362 --> 00:13:41.279 align:middle
Ah.

00:13:41.363 --> 00:13:43.031 align:middle
Flesh into flowers?

00:13:43.114 --> 00:13:44.407 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Why not?

00:13:44.491 --> 00:13:46.868 align:middle
It seems like the kind of thing
you'd enjoy immensely.

00:13:46.951 --> 00:13:48.828 align:middle
And I'll make sure
it's the perfect day.

00:13:48.912 --> 00:13:50.747 align:middle
I don't get why
you're so into this.

00:13:50.830 --> 00:13:53.333 align:middle
Ah. Come on,
everyone has something

00:13:53.416 --> 00:13:55.168 align:middle
that can be healed with flowers!

00:13:55.251 --> 00:13:59.089 align:middle
Oh, but for now, let me
get you some more yummy soup.

00:13:59.172 --> 00:14:01.091 align:middle
[LUCOA chuckles]

00:14:02.967 --> 00:14:05.637 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.430 align:middle
This is someone's flesh?!

00:14:07.514 --> 00:14:09.265 align:middle
It looks just like
cherry blossoms!

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:11.393 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Gorgeous, isn't it?

00:14:11.476 --> 00:14:13.269 align:middle
Well, I packed us
a little liquid lunch,

00:14:13.353 --> 00:14:15.814 align:middle
so lemme know when you're ready!

00:14:15.897 --> 00:14:17.148 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, I'm ready.

00:14:17.232 --> 00:14:18.942 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Ahem. If it's okay with you,

00:14:19.025 --> 00:14:21.569 align:middle
I'll introduce
myself as the emcee.

00:14:21.653 --> 00:14:23.029 align:middle
First things first,

00:14:23.113 --> 00:14:25.031 align:middle
thank you all for joining us
today for Miss Kobayashi's

00:14:25.115 --> 00:14:27.117 align:middle
official flower viewing!

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:29.285 align:middle
We have several things to do
and they were all crafted

00:14:29.369 --> 00:14:31.121 align:middle
with Miss Kobayashi in mind.

00:14:31.204 --> 00:14:33.498 align:middle
So, lend a hand where you can
and make sure that she's having

00:14:33.581 --> 00:14:35.125 align:middle
--the best time possible!
--I don't know what

00:14:35.208 --> 00:14:36.626 align:middle
you're trying to pull,
but cut it out!

00:14:39.295 --> 00:14:40.547 align:middle
Ah?

00:14:40.630 --> 00:14:42.507 align:middle
--Ah.
--[sighs]

00:14:42.590 --> 00:14:44.801 align:middle
This mochi's so good!

00:14:47.929 --> 00:14:49.305 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI sighs]

00:14:51.808 --> 00:14:53.393 align:middle
Now that's what
I'm talkin' about.

00:14:53.476 --> 00:14:55.895 align:middle
There's something so satisfying
about drinking booze

00:14:55.979 --> 00:14:57.313 align:middle
and enjoying nature.

00:14:57.397 --> 00:15:01.317 align:middle
Ah? Enjoying nature, huh?

00:15:01.401 --> 00:15:05.280 align:middle
You say that as though humans
are so far removed from nature.

00:15:05.363 --> 00:15:06.823 align:middle
Yeah, you're right.

00:15:06.906 --> 00:15:08.992 align:middle
Maybe that's just what happens
when we try to seek beauty

00:15:09.075 --> 00:15:12.662 align:middle
objectively and share
it with each other.

00:15:12.746 --> 00:15:15.582 align:middle
Uh. You guys should've
just stayed home.

00:15:15.665 --> 00:15:17.000 align:middle
What's the point?

00:15:17.083 --> 00:15:19.336 align:middle
Nah, this is the best part
of these shindigs.

00:15:19.419 --> 00:15:21.379 align:middle
Takiya! I need you
to stay focused!

00:15:21.463 --> 00:15:23.214 align:middle
It's gonna take all of us
to sever the tail!

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:24.841 align:middle
Are you in or are you fired?

00:15:24.924 --> 00:15:27.844 align:middle
It's amazing how much
you rely on each other!

00:15:27.927 --> 00:15:30.680 align:middle
Uh. Shouta, you're
getting in on this, too?

00:15:30.764 --> 00:15:33.099 align:middle
I guess. It's mostly
girls out here.

00:15:33.183 --> 00:15:34.934 align:middle
I feel so awkward.

00:15:35.018 --> 00:15:35.977 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Makes sense.

00:15:36.061 --> 00:15:38.063 align:middle
What's going on?
Are you bored?

00:15:38.146 --> 00:15:39.773 align:middle
--[KOBAYASHI] Elma?
--Right.

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.026 align:middle
Time for me to strip down
and show you what I've got!

00:15:43.109 --> 00:15:44.944 align:middle
--[KOBAYASHI] Huh?!
--[SHOUTA squeals]

00:15:46.654 --> 00:15:47.572 align:middle
Wow!

00:15:47.655 --> 00:15:49.574 align:middle
Okay, what's this
nonsense about?

00:15:49.657 --> 00:15:51.534 align:middle
I heard it was common
to perform a thing or two

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:53.078 align:middle
at events like these.

00:15:53.161 --> 00:15:55.538 align:middle
I did some research and
found that this was the best.

00:15:55.622 --> 00:15:57.499 align:middle
You really went all out for it.

00:15:57.582 --> 00:15:59.250 align:middle
Usually, it's just
old men that do that,

00:15:59.334 --> 00:16:01.002 align:middle
not young, beautiful women.

00:16:01.086 --> 00:16:02.128 align:middle
[laughing]

00:16:02.212 --> 00:16:03.672 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Whoa. I guess he likes it!

00:16:03.755 --> 00:16:04.673 align:middle
Then there's her.

00:16:04.756 --> 00:16:07.592 align:middle
[laughing]
So pathetic!

00:16:07.676 --> 00:16:09.010 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
She has her own reasons.

00:16:09.094 --> 00:16:10.261 align:middle
Oh!

00:16:10.345 --> 00:16:12.222 align:middle
[KANNA] Next time,
I'll do that for Saikawa!

00:16:12.305 --> 00:16:14.307 align:middle
So cute! I'll show it to Take.

00:16:14.391 --> 00:16:16.601 align:middle
Please, I wish you wouldn't.

00:16:16.685 --> 00:16:19.145 align:middle
Can you feel it?!
Everyone's so excited!

00:16:19.229 --> 00:16:20.939 align:middle
It's almost time for
the competition,

00:16:21.022 --> 00:16:23.191 align:middle
so please draw to
determine the brackets.

00:16:23.274 --> 00:16:24.484 align:middle
What are we doing?

00:16:24.567 --> 00:16:26.736 align:middle
Arm wrestling competition!

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:28.905 align:middle
Did you draw
the two arms on that box?!
