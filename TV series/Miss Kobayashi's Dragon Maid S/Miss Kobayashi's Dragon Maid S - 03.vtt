00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:11.094 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Hey, Kanna! It's time to play!

00:00:11.177 --> 00:00:14.764 align:middle
Oh! Hi Saikawa!

00:00:14.848 --> 00:00:16.891 align:middle
Thank you for coming
over to play today,

00:00:16.975 --> 00:00:18.101 align:middle
I'm glad you're here.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.603 align:middle
And I am so glad
to be here, Kanna!

00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:24.232 align:middle
So, uh... Are we all alone?
Where's your mother?

00:00:24.315 --> 00:00:26.693 align:middle
She went out shopping
with Lady Tohru.

00:00:26.776 --> 00:00:28.528 align:middle
[SAIKAWA gasps]

00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:29.904 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
So that means...

00:00:29.988 --> 00:00:32.115 align:middle
--...it's just the two of us?
--[KANNA] Hmm?

00:00:32.198 --> 00:00:36.286 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Oh, my, my!
What do I do? Am I on my way

00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:37.704 align:middle
--to becoming a woman?
--Are you okay?

00:00:37.787 --> 00:00:40.248 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Is this my own
Cinderella story?!

00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:42.417 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] I think I may need
to use your bathroom.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.418 align:middle
Where is it?

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.045 align:middle
[KANNA]
Down and to the right.

00:00:49.924 --> 00:00:54.054 align:middle
[SAIKAWA sighs]
I've got the first-time jitters.

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:56.723 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm.

00:00:56.806 --> 00:00:59.267 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Um... Excuse me.

00:01:01.186 --> 00:01:02.270 align:middle
[SAIKAWA yelps]

00:01:02.354 --> 00:01:04.981 align:middle
Who's the strange girl
in the bathroom?!

00:01:05.065 --> 00:01:08.151 align:middle
[KANNA]
Ilulu. She's a friend.

00:01:08.234 --> 00:01:13.031 align:middle
[SAIKAWA groans] So it isn't
just the two of us after all...

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:46.958 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] How long have
you known each other?

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:48.460 align:middle
[KANNA]
A while.

00:02:48.543 --> 00:02:51.755 align:middle
But she just came here recently
and now she lives with us.

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.631 align:middle
She moved in?!

00:02:53.715 --> 00:02:56.009 align:middle
[whines]

00:02:56.092 --> 00:02:58.011 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Now that I think
about it, there are a lot

00:02:58.094 --> 00:02:59.679 align:middle
of mysteries around Kanna.

00:02:59.763 --> 00:03:02.057 align:middle
She always calls her mother
by her last name,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.392 align:middle
and she addresses
the maid as "Lady."

00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.770 align:middle
Sometimes, I think
she's not all there,

00:03:06.853 --> 00:03:08.188 align:middle
but then she says
something smart.

00:03:08.271 --> 00:03:09.522 align:middle
Plus, she's athletic.

00:03:09.606 --> 00:03:12.859 align:middle
Saikawa, are we
gonna play or not?

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:15.445 align:middle
Whatever! Who cares?!
She's still cute!

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:18.740 align:middle
Yeah! I brought
some cards with me.

00:03:18.823 --> 00:03:20.408 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm!

00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:23.495 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Uh... Mm...

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:26.498 align:middle
Do you like cards, Ilulu?
Wanna play with us?

00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:28.208 align:middle
[KANNA]
Come play!

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.877 align:middle
No, thanks. I'm fine.

00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:36.883 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
I don't get it.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:39.719 align:middle
Did I say something
to upset her?

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:41.346 align:middle
Ugh! I lost!

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:44.140 align:middle
It's too easy.
I see it on your face.

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:47.852 align:middle
[sighs] I pick the penalty.
You must rub my tummy.

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.646 align:middle
[gasps]

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.231 align:middle
[whimpers]

00:03:55.068 --> 00:03:56.194 align:middle
[KANNA sighs]

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:59.781 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
This feels more like a reward!

00:03:59.864 --> 00:04:01.700 align:middle
[door bell rings]

00:04:01.783 --> 00:04:04.035 align:middle
Hey there! I just happened
to be in the neighborhood.

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:06.788 align:middle
So I brought you
rugrats some snacks.

00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:08.707 align:middle
Kobayashi and Tohru aren't here.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.083 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Oh, darn!

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:11.918 align:middle
I guess I'll have to stay
and wait for them, then.

00:04:12.002 --> 00:04:13.920 align:middle
Meanwhile, split the snacks
with your friend here.

00:04:14.004 --> 00:04:15.422 align:middle
[KANNA, SAIKAWA]
Yay!

00:04:17.632 --> 00:04:19.092 align:middle
[knocking]

00:04:20.552 --> 00:04:22.512 align:middle
Hey, kid.

00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:25.932 align:middle
What's wrong? Why aren't you
playing with the others?

00:04:26.016 --> 00:04:29.769 align:middle
[ILULU groans]
I have no right to...

00:04:29.853 --> 00:04:33.189 align:middle
I've been evil.
I tried to destroy this city.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:38.361 align:middle
[ILULU]
I haven't forgiven myself yet.

00:04:38.445 --> 00:04:40.447 align:middle
Then would you like me to
turn back time and make it

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.407 align:middle
so it never happened?

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.035 align:middle
I could at least do
that much for you.

00:04:45.118 --> 00:04:49.039 align:middle
[ILULU groans] No, it's fine.
I know that isn't fair.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:50.999 align:middle
Besides, there's something
Kobayashi said to me

00:04:51.082 --> 00:04:53.835 align:middle
the other day that I can't
stop hearing in my head.

00:04:53.918 --> 00:04:57.547 align:middle
Uh. Okay, cool.
But "no right" to play?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.299 align:middle
Seems a little dramatic to me.

00:04:59.382 --> 00:05:00.633 align:middle
I mean most dragons
don't have the right

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:03.970 align:middle
to interact with humans,
yet here you are.

00:05:04.054 --> 00:05:06.598 align:middle
[ILULU groans]

00:05:06.681 --> 00:05:08.308 align:middle
[LUCOA sighs]

00:05:08.391 --> 00:05:11.644 align:middle
[LUCOA] It's not working like
it did with Miss Kobayashi.

00:05:11.728 --> 00:05:14.356 align:middle
[LUCOA] I'll go talk to them
for a bit and see what I can do.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:15.899 align:middle
[ILULU]
Uh.

00:05:15.982 --> 00:05:17.400 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Why don't you wait somewhere?

00:05:17.484 --> 00:05:18.818 align:middle
Yeah, there's good.

00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:25.075 align:middle
[ILULU]
The truth is I want to play.

00:05:25.158 --> 00:05:28.578 align:middle
I don't have to lie about
those feelings anymore.

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:32.374 align:middle
I just don't want them
to find out about what I did.

00:05:32.457 --> 00:05:35.085 align:middle
[ILULU] And I don't want
anyone to remind Kobayashi.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:38.046 align:middle
It seems like she's okay
as long as it's resolved.

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.382 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Argh! I lost again!

00:05:40.465 --> 00:05:41.383 align:middle
[sobs]

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:43.551 align:middle
Saikawa. Are you
losing on purpose?

00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:47.097 align:middle
Ah! No! Not at all!
Why would I do that?!

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:48.973 align:middle
[KANNA]
Okay. I'm bored playing cards

00:05:49.057 --> 00:05:50.392 align:middle
by ourselves now.

00:05:50.475 --> 00:05:52.018 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] I'm having so much fun
with just the two of us!

00:05:52.102 --> 00:05:53.353 align:middle
Need to pee beam!

00:05:53.478 --> 00:05:55.230 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Eee...!

00:05:57.107 --> 00:06:00.860 align:middle
[SAIKAWA grunts]
I gotta pee. I'll be right back!

00:06:00.944 --> 00:06:02.779 align:middle
[KANNA]
Already?

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:04.155 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
I didn't drink any water.

00:06:04.239 --> 00:06:05.907 align:middle
Why do I have to go so much?

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:07.033 align:middle
Waugh!

00:06:07.117 --> 00:06:09.911 align:middle
Uh. Um. I'm so sorry!

00:06:09.994 --> 00:06:11.287 align:middle
--[thunk]
--Ah!

00:06:11.371 --> 00:06:13.790 align:middle
Uh. I'm... lost... Sorta.

00:06:13.873 --> 00:06:16.418 align:middle
So, uh. Will you tell me
what your name is?

00:06:16.501 --> 00:06:19.087 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Uh. Saikawa?

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.505 align:middle
[ILULU]
Saikawa.

00:06:20.588 --> 00:06:23.758 align:middle
I, um... I actually wanted
to play with you earlier.

00:06:23.842 --> 00:06:25.468 align:middle
Huh?

00:06:25.552 --> 00:06:27.929 align:middle
[ILULU] But I didn't think
I was allowed to.

00:06:28.013 --> 00:06:30.265 align:middle
I used to be kinda violent.

00:06:30.348 --> 00:06:32.308 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
How were you violent?

00:06:33.226 --> 00:06:36.521 align:middle
[ILULU] I tried to break
all sorts of things.

00:06:36.604 --> 00:06:39.941 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Oh... So a delinquent.

00:06:40.025 --> 00:06:41.484 align:middle
[ILULU]
I know what you think.

00:06:41.568 --> 00:06:43.695 align:middle
Violence is bad.

00:06:43.778 --> 00:06:45.905 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Hmm...

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:50.160 align:middle
[sighs] I'm actually a pretty
violent person myself.

00:06:50.243 --> 00:06:52.787 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm? You mean that?

00:06:52.871 --> 00:06:55.957 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Yeah! I tend to act
out when I don't like something.

00:06:56.041 --> 00:06:57.208 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:57.292 --> 00:06:59.252 align:middle
When I first met Kanna,
I didn't like her at all

00:06:59.336 --> 00:07:01.713 align:middle
and I thought of many
ways to strike her down.

00:07:01.796 --> 00:07:03.465 align:middle
[ILULU]
Wow, she's...

00:07:03.548 --> 00:07:06.301 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] But, um...
She's way too cute to hurt,

00:07:06.384 --> 00:07:08.803 align:middle
so I decided to be
friends instead!

00:07:08.887 --> 00:07:09.888 align:middle
[ILULU]
She's so...

00:07:09.971 --> 00:07:12.766 align:middle
And to be honest,
you're cute, too!

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:14.768 align:middle
I wanna be your friend, Ilulu!

00:07:14.851 --> 00:07:18.021 align:middle
[ILULU]
She's completely lost her mind!

00:07:18.104 --> 00:07:20.065 align:middle
[LUCOA] Children that age
shouldn't be thinking about

00:07:20.148 --> 00:07:23.526 align:middle
who they can and can't play
with based on their pasts.

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:26.696 align:middle
They're still learning to take
responsibility for their faults.

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.741 align:middle
Ilulu never had that
opportunity where she's from.

00:07:29.824 --> 00:07:33.161 align:middle
She had to do what she was told
or be forced into battle.

00:07:33.244 --> 00:07:35.163 align:middle
She had to be what
the adults wanted her to be

00:07:35.246 --> 00:07:38.124 align:middle
if she wanted to
fight alongside them.

00:07:38.208 --> 00:07:41.127 align:middle
Thankfully, she can
let go of that here.

00:07:41.211 --> 00:07:43.588 align:middle
She has an adult who will be
kind to her and encourage her

00:07:43.672 --> 00:07:45.340 align:middle
to be herself.

00:07:45.423 --> 00:07:47.717 align:middle
And if that means being
an irresponsible brat

00:07:47.801 --> 00:07:50.887 align:middle
who doesn't know right
from wrong, so be it.

00:08:02.857 --> 00:08:07.529 align:middle
[inaudible]

00:08:21.251 --> 00:08:22.669 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
We're home!

00:08:22.752 --> 00:08:24.671 align:middle
Hey, Lucoa, I didn't know
you were here.

00:08:24.754 --> 00:08:27.841 align:middle
Sorry to make you wait--
we ran into Elma.

00:08:27.924 --> 00:08:29.384 align:middle
Shh...

00:08:29.467 --> 00:08:31.678 align:middle
--[KOBAYASHI] Hmm?
--Huh?

00:08:31.761 --> 00:08:33.013 align:middle
Aww...

00:08:33.096 --> 00:08:34.931 align:middle
[snoring]

00:08:35.015 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Should I wake them up?

00:08:37.183 --> 00:08:39.978 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
No, go grab a blanket.

00:08:40.061 --> 00:08:42.605 align:middle
I should probably
call Saikawa's parents.

00:08:52.073 --> 00:08:54.909 align:middle
[TOHRU] I can feel Miss
Kobayashi's eyes on my body.

00:08:54.993 --> 00:08:56.661 align:middle
She's staring right through me!

00:08:56.745 --> 00:09:00.123 align:middle
I can feel her passion
burning through her side eye!

00:09:00.206 --> 00:09:03.209 align:middle
She's imagining what it would
be like to lick me all over,

00:09:03.293 --> 00:09:05.795 align:middle
I can tell! If she
doesn't stop, I'll just...

00:09:05.879 --> 00:09:07.213 align:middle
--I'll die!
--[sighs]

00:09:07.297 --> 00:09:08.423 align:middle
Did you sigh?!

00:09:08.506 --> 00:09:10.842 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm? Yeah, but not about you.

00:09:10.925 --> 00:09:12.510 align:middle
It's that maid outfit.

00:09:12.594 --> 00:09:14.179 align:middle
What? This one?

00:09:14.262 --> 00:09:16.181 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah.

00:09:16.264 --> 00:09:18.516 align:middle
I used to have one
like it in high school.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.643 align:middle
I wanted to dress
like a maid, too.

00:09:20.727 --> 00:09:23.188 align:middle
Used all the money
from my first paycheck.

00:09:23.271 --> 00:09:25.815 align:middle
I wanted to show it off
to my family.

00:09:25.899 --> 00:09:27.108 align:middle
And that's when...

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:28.610 align:middle
What happened?

00:09:28.693 --> 00:09:30.362 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
They said I looked horrible.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:34.324 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Everyone hated it
and told me so.

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:37.202 align:middle
Ever since then,
I've embraced being an onlooker.

00:09:38.495 --> 00:09:41.164 align:middle
[TOHRU] So, after we had
that tragic conversation,

00:09:41.247 --> 00:09:43.833 align:middle
I have come up with
a brilliant solution.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:45.669 align:middle
We should all design
a new style of maid outfit

00:09:45.752 --> 00:09:48.296 align:middle
that would look cute
on Miss Kobayashi!

00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle
I was hoping I could count
on advice from each of you.

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:54.219 align:middle
It's cute how desperate
you become when you think

00:09:54.302 --> 00:09:56.221 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi
needs something.

00:09:56.304 --> 00:09:58.890 align:middle
It means a lot to me that you
could each be here today.

00:09:58.973 --> 00:10:02.268 align:middle
Elma! What are you doing here?!
No one invited you!

00:10:02.352 --> 00:10:04.396 align:middle
[ELMA] That's not true.
Mister Takiya invited me.

00:10:04.479 --> 00:10:06.356 align:middle
[TOHRU] What the heck
is wrong with you?!

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:08.858 align:middle
We were all coming,
and I felt bad leaving her out.

00:10:08.942 --> 00:10:11.361 align:middle
It's obvious you felt
guilty about it, though.

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.905 align:middle
You mask your embarrassment
with displaced anger.

00:10:13.988 --> 00:10:15.990 align:middle
What?! No, I don't! Shut up!

00:10:16.074 --> 00:10:18.535 align:middle
Oh, hey. Sorry,
I didn't mean to be rude.

00:10:18.618 --> 00:10:20.120 align:middle
I guess we're having a party.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:22.747 align:middle
Tohru must've planned
this while I was napping.

00:10:22.831 --> 00:10:24.958 align:middle
You don't have to be
so formal, you know.

00:10:25.041 --> 00:10:26.584 align:middle
We're your friends, too.

00:10:26.668 --> 00:10:27.961 align:middle
And I didn't think
it was a party.

00:10:28.044 --> 00:10:30.630 align:middle
I just responded to a friend
of mine needing help.

00:10:30.714 --> 00:10:32.007 align:middle
That's so beautiful.

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.426 align:middle
Okay, Georgie, that's enough
self-promotion today!

00:10:34.509 --> 00:10:37.804 align:middle
It's time to get started!
Will you please draw your ideas?

00:10:37.887 --> 00:10:39.431 align:middle
[GROUP]
'Kay!

00:10:44.978 --> 00:10:46.563 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
You're so good at this, Kanna!

00:10:46.646 --> 00:10:50.316 align:middle
If you buy one more property,
you'll have a monopoly!

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.901 align:middle
A monopoly?

00:10:51.985 --> 00:10:53.862 align:middle
Yeah, it means you're,
like, the king of it!

00:10:53.945 --> 00:10:57.115 align:middle
You'll be able to do whatever
you want with all the spaces!

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.658 align:middle
[KANNA]
Ohh...

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.996 align:middle
[SAIKAWA gasps] Why would you
place a house in Kanna's area?!

00:11:03.079 --> 00:11:06.416 align:middle
[SHOUTA growls] Sorry 'bout it!
But this is a competition.

00:11:06.499 --> 00:11:07.751 align:middle
Waah!

00:11:07.834 --> 00:11:09.252 align:middle
[ILULU] I don't really
understand the rules,

00:11:09.336 --> 00:11:12.672 align:middle
but this game seems to bring out
the worst in all of them.

00:11:12.756 --> 00:11:13.673 align:middle
Done!

00:11:13.757 --> 00:11:15.467 align:middle
That was fast. Let's see.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:17.761 align:middle
When Miss Kobayashi's at work,
she's always so stoic

00:11:17.844 --> 00:11:19.846 align:middle
and gets everything done
as soon as possible.

00:11:19.929 --> 00:11:21.639 align:middle
So I came up with this!

00:11:21.723 --> 00:11:23.350 align:middle
[TOHRU] What does your obsession
with dessert have to do

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:24.517 align:middle
with any of this?!

00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:25.518 align:middle
[sighs]

00:11:25.602 --> 00:11:27.103 align:middle
What? It's symbolic?

00:11:27.187 --> 00:11:29.856 align:middle
It's my favorite meal and
it makes me feel secure.

00:11:29.939 --> 00:11:32.108 align:middle
Ugh. Will you please
go play with the children

00:11:32.192 --> 00:11:34.527 align:middle
in the other room?
I can't handle you.

00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:36.780 align:middle
Okay, see what
you think of this one.

00:11:36.863 --> 00:11:39.199 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI sighs]
I mean, it's cute,

00:11:39.282 --> 00:11:41.993 align:middle
but, like, too cute, as in,
it won't look good on me.

00:11:42.077 --> 00:11:44.871 align:middle
Uh... That's awkward--
were we supposed to draw one

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.373 align:middle
with the idea you would wear it?

00:11:46.456 --> 00:11:47.624 align:middle
Kinda.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:48.625 align:middle
Tch!

00:11:48.708 --> 00:11:50.418 align:middle
I'm done, too!

00:11:50.502 --> 00:11:51.836 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Where's the top?

00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.129 align:middle
[LUCOA] I dunno, our local
servants never complained

00:11:53.213 --> 00:11:54.673 align:middle
when they had them on.

00:11:54.756 --> 00:11:56.383 align:middle
I'm too pasty to wear this.

00:11:56.466 --> 00:11:57.884 align:middle
Mine's done.

00:11:57.967 --> 00:11:59.344 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay, let's see.

00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:00.845 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Oh, thank goodness.

00:12:00.929 --> 00:12:02.931 align:middle
She's the one I'm counting on.

00:12:03.014 --> 00:12:04.349 align:middle
Here. See what you think.

00:12:04.432 --> 00:12:05.725 align:middle
Oh. Thanks.

00:12:06.851 --> 00:12:08.269 align:middle
[GEORGIE] I went with
the longer dress style

00:12:08.353 --> 00:12:10.021 align:middle
and very minimal adornments.

00:12:10.105 --> 00:12:13.149 align:middle
She's serving classic refinement
with small-town simplicity.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:15.777 align:middle
If I remember correctly,
that's your type, isn't it?

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.654 align:middle
Yeah. It is.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:20.865 align:middle
However, we really can't
define one "maid outfit."

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.075 align:middle
Huh?

00:12:22.158 --> 00:12:23.827 align:middle
Though the styles change
with different eras,

00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:25.829 align:middle
the design becomes
more polished every day

00:12:25.912 --> 00:12:29.749 align:middle
as the maid herself evolves
in preferences and customs.

00:12:29.833 --> 00:12:33.753 align:middle
What's consistent, is that it's
always a maid who wears it.

00:12:33.837 --> 00:12:36.464 align:middle
It's her talent and skill that
qualifies one as a maid,

00:12:36.548 --> 00:12:39.092 align:middle
not what she wears.

00:12:39.175 --> 00:12:41.011 align:middle
The maid outfit is called
that because a maid

00:12:41.094 --> 00:12:43.179 align:middle
decided to wear it.

00:12:43.263 --> 00:12:44.556 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:44.639 --> 00:12:48.268 align:middle
[GEORGIE] Miss Kobayashi,
I am also a student.

00:12:48.351 --> 00:12:50.895 align:middle
It would be inappropriate for me
to wear my maid outfit to school

00:12:50.979 --> 00:12:52.939 align:middle
or out with friends,
wouldn't it?

00:12:53.023 --> 00:12:54.941 align:middle
However, just because
I'm not wearing it

00:12:55.025 --> 00:12:56.526 align:middle
doesn't mean I'm not a maid.

00:12:56.609 --> 00:12:58.361 align:middle
Even if I'm wearing
my school uniform,

00:12:58.445 --> 00:13:01.114 align:middle
I'm still a maid but
in a different place.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.159 align:middle
Therefore, a school uniform can
actually become a maid outfit.

00:13:04.242 --> 00:13:05.744 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI gasps]

00:13:05.827 --> 00:13:09.581 align:middle
So, it's not what we wear,
it's what's in our hearts!

00:13:09.664 --> 00:13:11.082 align:middle
It's the spirit of service!

00:13:11.166 --> 00:13:12.959 align:middle
[bell tolling]

00:13:13.043 --> 00:13:14.961 align:middle
Quit changing the subject!

00:13:15.045 --> 00:13:16.171 align:middle
Hey, Tohru!

00:13:16.254 --> 00:13:18.089 align:middle
[TOHRU] You weren't
supposed to come back.

00:13:18.173 --> 00:13:19.632 align:middle
[ELMA]
We just finished a round!

00:13:19.716 --> 00:13:23.011 align:middle
But I'm curious, you've
been criticizing our designs,

00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:24.679 align:middle
I wanna see what
you came up with.

00:13:24.763 --> 00:13:26.639 align:middle
Ah! Yeah, okay. Later!

00:13:26.723 --> 00:13:28.975 align:middle
That's not suspicious
or anything. Lemme see!

00:13:29.059 --> 00:13:30.518 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Get off me, you pervert!

00:13:32.145 --> 00:13:34.564 align:middle
[ELMA] Huh? Tohru?
It's completely blank.

00:13:34.647 --> 00:13:37.984 align:middle
You couldn't think of anything?

00:13:38.068 --> 00:13:41.237 align:middle
It's not that. I was just
thinking I'd really like

00:13:41.321 --> 00:13:43.990 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi
to wear my maid outfit.

00:13:47.702 --> 00:13:49.079 align:middle
There's no way I could do that.

00:13:49.162 --> 00:13:51.498 align:middle
Your outfit is
too adorable for me.

00:13:51.581 --> 00:13:54.000 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Oh... Okay.

00:13:54.084 --> 00:13:56.961 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
But, sure. Why not?

00:13:57.045 --> 00:13:58.797 align:middle
I mean you did go out
of your way to arrange

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:01.675 align:middle
this maid fashion
focus group for me.

00:14:01.758 --> 00:14:03.301 align:middle
I'll do it.

00:14:03.385 --> 00:14:05.970 align:middle
Do you really mean that?

00:14:06.054 --> 00:14:08.765 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Okay, there. I'm wearing it.

00:14:08.848 --> 00:14:10.517 align:middle
[GROUP gasping]

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:11.643 align:middle
[giggles]

00:14:11.726 --> 00:14:12.769 align:middle
You look so good.

00:14:12.852 --> 00:14:14.646 align:middle
That one looks great on you.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:16.147 align:middle
Please, stop!

00:14:16.231 --> 00:14:18.400 align:middle
Enough with the flattery,
I don't know how to handle it.

00:14:18.483 --> 00:14:19.943 align:middle
Let's take a photo together!

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:21.695 align:middle
Me and you
in matching maid garb!

00:14:21.778 --> 00:14:24.114 align:middle
We're like maid twinsies!

00:14:24.197 --> 00:14:26.449 align:middle
If we're taking a photo,
then everyone should be in it.

00:14:26.533 --> 00:14:30.036 align:middle
Wah! Fine! Come on,
everyone. Get in here.

00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:32.080 align:middle
[KANNA] I get to be
next to Miss Kobayashi.

00:14:32.163 --> 00:14:33.581 align:middle
[ILULU]
Aww! That's not fair!

00:14:33.665 --> 00:14:36.876 align:middle
[TOHRU] It was my idea to
take it and I was here first!

00:14:38.503 --> 00:14:39.587 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey, Tohru?

00:14:39.671 --> 00:14:40.964 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Yis?

00:14:41.047 --> 00:14:43.299 align:middle
There's something
I realized today.

00:14:43.383 --> 00:14:44.843 align:middle
[TOHRU]
And what might that be?

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:47.887 align:middle
You remember what Georgie said?
The maid sermon?

00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.139 align:middle
Oh, yeah.

00:14:49.222 --> 00:14:51.975 align:middle
It's only a maid outfit
because a maid wears it.

00:14:52.058 --> 00:14:55.353 align:middle
That also means, If someone
wears the exact same outfit

00:14:55.437 --> 00:14:59.441 align:middle
but they're not really a maid,
then they're just a cosplayer.

00:14:59.524 --> 00:15:02.402 align:middle
Your uniform always bothered
me, but after wearing it today,

00:15:02.485 --> 00:15:06.698 align:middle
I had a change of heart,
embarrassing though it was.

00:15:06.781 --> 00:15:09.159 align:middle
It wasn't horrifying.

00:15:09.242 --> 00:15:11.286 align:middle
I've always liked that style and
wondered what it would be like

00:15:11.369 --> 00:15:13.496 align:middle
to wear one.

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:15.623 align:middle
But I didn't think I was
cute or girlie enough

00:15:15.707 --> 00:15:18.543 align:middle
so I wore men's clothes instead.

00:15:18.626 --> 00:15:21.921 align:middle
I was afraid others would laugh
if I wore a dress or something.

00:15:22.005 --> 00:15:24.424 align:middle
Well, now I realize if I wanted
to wear a maid outfit,

00:15:24.507 --> 00:15:25.967 align:middle
I should've just worn it.

00:15:26.051 --> 00:15:28.219 align:middle
And that showed me
another reality.

00:15:28.303 --> 00:15:31.598 align:middle
I wanted to be the cosplayer
I always mocked.

00:15:31.681 --> 00:15:34.726 align:middle
But I could never make myself
look as hot as the rest of them,

00:15:34.809 --> 00:15:38.271 align:middle
so I became an annoying maid
otaku instead and obsessed about

00:15:38.355 --> 00:15:40.857 align:middle
refinement and
historical accuracy.

00:15:40.940 --> 00:15:43.651 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi...

00:15:43.735 --> 00:15:46.279 align:middle
I get it now. I see you.

00:15:46.363 --> 00:15:49.532 align:middle
You work hard every day
to serve as the perfect maid.

00:15:49.616 --> 00:15:51.326 align:middle
I'm sorry I called
you a cosplayer--

00:15:51.409 --> 00:15:55.413 align:middle
Anything you wear can only be
defined as true maid attire.

00:15:55.497 --> 00:15:58.041 align:middle
[sighs]
Took you long enough to realize,

00:15:58.124 --> 00:15:59.876 align:middle
but at least you're
being genuine.

00:15:59.959 --> 00:16:03.380 align:middle
Luckily, I still love you when
you're unfair and unreasonable.

00:16:03.463 --> 00:16:05.173 align:middle
Ya know, I never could've
said these things to you

00:16:05.256 --> 00:16:08.468 align:middle
when you first came here--
gimme some credit at least.

00:16:08.551 --> 00:16:11.221 align:middle
I appreciate everything you
do around the house, Tohru.

00:16:11.304 --> 00:16:12.681 align:middle
Thank you.

00:16:12.764 --> 00:16:15.725 align:middle
[TOHRU] Maid Tohru! Why is that
so hard for you to say?!

00:16:19.938 --> 00:16:22.148 align:middle
[ILULU] Hey. This is
the last bill I have.

00:16:22.232 --> 00:16:24.442 align:middle
Ilulu, you're not
very good with money.

00:16:24.526 --> 00:16:25.944 align:middle
Don't worry about it.

00:16:26.027 --> 00:16:28.196 align:middle
I'm sure you'll pass
the bank pretty soon.

00:16:28.279 --> 00:16:30.448 align:middle
And that's when you'll
get some of your money back!

00:16:30.532 --> 00:16:31.616 align:middle
Okay, that's good.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.451 align:middle
[gasps]
But still...

00:16:33.535 --> 00:16:35.829 align:middle
Shouta's street
is right after that.

00:16:35.912 --> 00:16:37.664 align:middle
So no matter where I stop,
I'll still have to pay

00:16:37.747 --> 00:16:39.582 align:middle
expensive rental fees.

00:16:39.666 --> 00:16:42.335 align:middle
There's no need to be nervous
if you know what to expect!

00:16:42.419 --> 00:16:44.963 align:middle
[ILULU groans]
Shut up, rude demon!

00:16:46.297 --> 00:16:48.133 align:middle
Ilulu looks tapped out.

00:16:49.634 --> 00:16:51.720 align:middle
[SASAKIBE] Can you tell me
if you have any hobbies?

As far as free time...

[giggles]

00:17:00.395 --> 00:17:02.397 align:middle
[TOHRU] What are your
hobbies, Miss Sasakibe?

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.358 align:middle
Lately, I've been into making
all kinds of delicious sweets.

00:17:05.442 --> 00:17:08.194 align:middle
[TOHRU] Is that what that
piercing noise was earlier?

00:17:08.278 --> 00:17:11.698 align:middle
Oh! I'm so sorry!
Was it that loud?

00:17:11.781 --> 00:17:15.535 align:middle
[TOHRU] Well, darn.
I still can't think of anything.

00:17:15.618 --> 00:17:19.748 align:middle
I used to love travelling.
I wonder if that would count.

00:17:19.831 --> 00:17:21.458 align:middle
Maybe music?

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:25.128 align:middle
That's something that's
popular among the humans.

00:17:25.211 --> 00:17:28.423 align:middle
Speaking of music,
there's nihilistic Mister Yana.

00:17:28.506 --> 00:17:30.175 align:middle
You said you wanted
to ask me a question?

00:17:30.258 --> 00:17:31.468 align:middle
What is it?

00:17:31.551 --> 00:17:33.720 align:middle
I want to know what
you find fun about music.

00:17:33.803 --> 00:17:35.680 align:middle
Probably the way it lights
a fire in your soul

00:17:35.764 --> 00:17:37.682 align:middle
and makes your heart go bomber.

00:17:37.766 --> 00:17:40.268 align:middle
Makes your heart go bomber?

00:17:40.352 --> 00:17:41.519 align:middle
Go ahead and give it a try,

00:17:41.603 --> 00:17:43.396 align:middle
and then I'll teach you
some simple chords.

I didn't mean to depress him.

00:18:02.707 --> 00:18:04.417 align:middle
Hi, Mister Sone.

00:18:04.501 --> 00:18:06.294 align:middle
I just finished this one
and thought you might have

00:18:06.378 --> 00:18:07.671 align:middle
a shelf to put it on.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:10.298 align:middle
[TOHRU] Wow, it came out
exactly as good as the last.

00:18:10.382 --> 00:18:12.342 align:middle
You must have a lot of fun
making stuff like this,

00:18:12.425 --> 00:18:13.593 align:middle
don't you?

00:18:13.677 --> 00:18:15.345 align:middle
[SONE]
Would you like to try one?

00:18:17.389 --> 00:18:19.182 align:middle
What do you think?

00:18:19.265 --> 00:18:20.850 align:middle
Let's see...

00:18:20.934 --> 00:18:23.645 align:middle
It is an incredibly
elaborate design.

00:18:23.728 --> 00:18:25.438 align:middle
There aren't many who could
make something this advanced

00:18:25.522 --> 00:18:26.856 align:middle
on their first try.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.191 align:middle
Thanks, but I still
don't understand

00:18:28.274 --> 00:18:30.360 align:middle
what you find fun about it.

00:18:30.443 --> 00:18:33.321 align:middle
I tried playing some music,
too, but I wasn't amused.

00:18:33.405 --> 00:18:36.157 align:middle
Ya know, I'm fairly certain
I happened to hear that.

00:18:36.241 --> 00:18:38.159 align:middle
It sounded to me like
you were just focusing on

00:18:38.243 --> 00:18:41.246 align:middle
playing the notes instead
of making it your own.

00:18:41.329 --> 00:18:43.498 align:middle
So, you could tell
just by listening?

00:18:43.581 --> 00:18:45.625 align:middle
[SONE] Sounded like
it was too easy for you.

00:18:45.709 --> 00:18:47.168 align:middle
There was no challenge
to overcome,

00:18:47.252 --> 00:18:49.170 align:middle
so no emotion was invested.

00:18:49.254 --> 00:18:52.132 align:middle
Without curiosity
and emotional investment,

00:18:52.215 --> 00:18:54.843 align:middle
the hobby you choose
won't be fulfilling.

00:18:54.926 --> 00:18:58.179 align:middle

supposed to work?

Would you say that
you have any hobbies?

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:06.563 align:middle
Yeah, duh.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:09.024 align:middle
I like to walk
on this white line.

00:19:09.107 --> 00:19:11.234 align:middle
How are you emotionally
invested in this?

00:19:11.317 --> 00:19:12.569 align:middle

as a dragon seriously enough!

any hobbies, Ilulu?

00:19:51.775 --> 00:19:54.361 align:middle
I do. I'm very good at sleeping.

that's your lifestyle choice.
