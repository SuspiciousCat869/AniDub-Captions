[SHOUTA sighs]
Oh, right!

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:31.489 align:middle
I'm home!

00:00:31.573 --> 00:00:32.824 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Welcome back!

00:00:32.907 --> 00:00:35.076 align:middle
Shouta baby, we've got snacks.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.412 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
No, thanks. I don't need any!

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.513 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Shouta baby, what's the matter?

00:02:18.596 --> 00:02:21.641 align:middle
Just trying to think of a good
present to make for Dad's Day.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:23.393 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Tats Day?

00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.478 align:middle
[gasps]
A talisman?

00:02:25.562 --> 00:02:27.897 align:middle
It might be a little difficult,
but I can do it.

00:02:27.981 --> 00:02:30.066 align:middle
How cool! Allow me
to help you out, then.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.569 align:middle
--No, thanks.
--Huh?

00:02:32.652 --> 00:02:35.280 align:middle
[SHOUTA] This is something
I have to do on my own.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.324 align:middle
Anyway, that's what happened.

00:02:38.408 --> 00:02:41.161 align:middle
Wow, a Father's Day
present, huh?

00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:43.038 align:middle
What a thoughtful little guy.

00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:44.581 align:middle
[LUCOA] Mm-hmm! I'm looking
forward to seeing

00:02:44.664 --> 00:02:46.666 align:middle
what he finally
comes up with for me.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.043 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:02:48.126 --> 00:02:49.878 align:middle
Aren't talismans those
protective charm-like-things

00:02:49.961 --> 00:02:52.339 align:middle
I see humans carry around a lot?

00:02:52.422 --> 00:02:56.217 align:middle
You do? Can you tell if they
work or not and to what extent?

00:02:56.301 --> 00:02:57.844 align:middle
They don't work at all.

00:02:57.927 --> 00:03:00.555 align:middle
They all go up in flames along
with the humans gripping them.

00:03:00.638 --> 00:03:02.724 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Sounds like
a first-hand testimony.

00:03:02.807 --> 00:03:04.976 align:middle
You say that as if all
talismans are full of crap,

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.812 align:middle
but they actually work quite
well with proper magic.

00:03:07.896 --> 00:03:09.272 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
They do?

00:03:09.356 --> 00:03:11.399 align:middle
What I don't get is how a
talisman is supposed to show

00:03:11.483 --> 00:03:13.651 align:middle
someone you appreciate
their yabbos.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:16.363 align:middle
Okay, I'm confused--which
conversation are you in?

00:03:16.446 --> 00:03:17.781 align:middle
Huh? You know.

00:03:17.864 --> 00:03:19.240 align:middle
We're talking about Tits Day.

00:03:19.324 --> 00:03:22.494 align:middle
Uh... Seriously?
I need to go lie down.

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:27.957 align:middle
[SHOUTA whimpers]

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.177 align:middle
Let me see...

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.012 align:middle
Whoa! That's a lot!

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:43.682 align:middle
Looks like the official ones
are sold out.

00:03:43.765 --> 00:03:46.726 align:middle
The ratings are so low.
I can't tell if they're good!

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:51.773 align:middle
[sighs]

00:03:51.856 --> 00:03:53.441 align:middle
That does it.

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.987 align:middle
[DELIVERY MAN 208A]
Thank you very much!

00:03:58.071 --> 00:04:00.699 align:middle
[SHOUTA groans]

00:04:00.782 --> 00:04:02.492 align:middle
Huh...?

00:04:02.575 --> 00:04:05.453 align:middle
[SHOUTA] Uh, okay, first,
I take a unicorn's horn

00:04:05.537 --> 00:04:06.913 align:middle
and wyvern's blood.

00:04:06.996 --> 00:04:09.249 align:middle
Ground branches from
a tree with a human face

00:04:09.332 --> 00:04:11.960 align:middle
and one dried blue rose.

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:14.045 align:middle
That's that.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.381 align:middle
Now I let everything stew
for an hour and wait for

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:18.842 align:middle
the smell to fade,
then I'll cast the bonding spell

00:04:18.925 --> 00:04:20.927 align:middle
and it should be complete.

00:04:21.011 --> 00:04:22.595 align:middle

Hmm.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:26.683 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Yeah! I'm fine!

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.019 align:middle
[LUCOA]
I could help you a tiny bit!

00:04:29.102 --> 00:04:31.646 align:middle
Please don't!
I promise, I'm fine!

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:33.314 align:middle

00:04:33.398 --> 00:04:34.774 align:middle

[TAKIYA]
Nice going, bro!

00:05:13.313 --> 00:05:15.940 align:middle
Man, this new event
quest is a beast!

00:05:16.024 --> 00:05:17.734 align:middle
At this rate,
I'm gonna get KO'd.

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:19.110 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Yeah, you are.

00:05:19.194 --> 00:05:20.945 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
It's not that bad.

00:05:28.119 --> 00:05:30.872 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Hey, Shouta, what's bugging you?

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:32.665 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Hmm? Um. Nothing.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:34.209 align:middle
Why do think I'm bugged?

00:05:34.292 --> 00:05:35.919 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Eh, just a feeling I get.

00:05:36.002 --> 00:05:38.630 align:middle
[SHOUTA gasps]

00:05:38.713 --> 00:05:41.591 align:middle
To be honest, I'm trying
to make a talisman for

00:05:41.675 --> 00:05:45.136 align:middle
a Father's Day present,
but it's not going well.

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.721 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
I see.

00:05:46.805 --> 00:05:49.891 align:middle
[SHOUTA] I followed the steps
written in the grimoire exactly,

00:05:49.974 --> 00:05:52.227 align:middle
so I don't get why
it isn't working.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.021 align:middle
I want to show my Father
how good I am at something,

00:05:55.105 --> 00:05:56.731 align:middle
but I keep messing up.

00:05:56.815 --> 00:06:00.235 align:middle
I just need to hurry
and become a real life mage.

00:06:01.277 --> 00:06:03.071 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Look at it like playing a game.

00:06:03.154 --> 00:06:04.406 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
A game?

00:06:04.489 --> 00:06:05.907 align:middle
[TAKIYA] When you fight
enemies that you know are

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.536 align:middle
a higher level, you don't
exactly expect to win, right?

00:06:09.619 --> 00:06:11.246 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Yeah, that's true.

00:06:11.329 --> 00:06:13.998 align:middle
[TAKIYA] So, if you really
want to defeat them,

00:06:14.082 --> 00:06:15.959 align:middle
you should try thinking about
the developers' feelings

00:06:16.042 --> 00:06:17.252 align:middle
at the time.

00:06:17.335 --> 00:06:19.129 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
The developers?

00:06:19.212 --> 00:06:22.173 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Yeah! Games don't
just appear out of nowhere--

00:06:22.257 --> 00:06:24.759 align:middle
they're programmed worlds
and they only operate exactly

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:26.928 align:middle
as the developers intended.

00:06:27.012 --> 00:06:29.097 align:middle
So then, try to imagine what
they were feeling when

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:30.932 align:middle
they designed a level.

00:06:31.016 --> 00:06:32.809 align:middle
What did they want
their players to do?

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:35.103 align:middle
If you can get
inside that mindset,

00:06:35.186 --> 00:06:36.813 align:middle
then the instructions on
how to clear the game

00:06:36.896 --> 00:06:39.024 align:middle
will become blatantly obvious.

00:06:39.107 --> 00:06:41.860 align:middle
That's the part you always
have a problem with, too.

00:06:41.943 --> 00:06:44.070 align:middle
[TAKIYA sighs] When you're
on the developer's side,

00:06:44.154 --> 00:06:46.531 align:middle
you find that it's a huge pain
in the A to figure out ways

00:06:46.614 --> 00:06:48.867 align:middle
to mislead your players.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:50.285 align:middle
Think like a developer...

00:06:50.368 --> 00:06:51.703 align:middle
Okay.

00:06:51.786 --> 00:06:53.288 align:middle
[gasps]

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:54.497 align:middle
Thank you so much!

00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.750 align:middle
I'll go ahead
and give it another try!

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:58.835 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Mm-hmm!

00:06:58.918 --> 00:07:01.129 align:middle
[SHOUTA] There has to be some
kind of condition required

00:07:01.212 --> 00:07:04.090 align:middle
that's not written
in the grimoire.

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:06.343 align:middle
But what could it be?

00:07:09.929 --> 00:07:11.264 align:middle
All right.

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:13.892 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
It's done!

00:07:14.976 --> 00:07:16.061 align:middle
Lucoa, look!

00:07:16.144 --> 00:07:18.104 align:middle
I finished the talisman!

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.899 align:middle
Oh. Great, Shouta baby.

00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:22.233 align:middle
How'd you do it?

00:07:22.317 --> 00:07:24.027 align:middle
I thought about the person
who wrote the grimoire,

00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:25.528 align:middle
and when I looked up
where it was written,

00:07:25.612 --> 00:07:27.364 align:middle
I found out it was written in
what we call the Dead Sea,

00:07:27.447 --> 00:07:28.782 align:middle
which is below sea level.

00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:30.116 align:middle
So, I decided to recreate
that very same environment

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.451 align:middle
by increasing the
air pressure in my room,

00:07:31.534 --> 00:07:33.286 align:middle
and that's when I
discovered the secret--

00:07:33.370 --> 00:07:35.497 align:middle
[gasps]
Never mind! Forget it!

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.332 align:middle
Why am I spilling
my guts to a demon?!

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.875 align:middle
Huh...?!

00:07:51.179 --> 00:07:54.891 align:middle
[sighs]

00:07:57.977 --> 00:07:59.604 align:middle
Did he like the present?

00:08:00.605 --> 00:08:02.190 align:middle
Yeah, sure.

00:08:02.273 --> 00:08:06.861 align:middle
But... he said
I need to work harder.

00:08:06.945 --> 00:08:12.075 align:middle
[LUCOA chuckles] Aw, Shouta,
you've worked very hard.

00:08:12.158 --> 00:08:13.368 align:middle
[SHOUTA grunting]

00:08:13.451 --> 00:08:15.745 align:middle
Happy Breast-Friends Day!

00:08:15.829 --> 00:08:18.915 align:middle
[SHOUTA, muffled]
Hey! Stop it! Let me out!

00:08:23.044 --> 00:08:24.838 align:middle
[sighs]

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.047 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm.

00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:28.049 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm? Shoulder massage tickets?

00:08:28.133 --> 00:08:29.175 align:middle
What for?

00:08:29.259 --> 00:08:30.969 align:middle
It's a present.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:34.180 align:middle
For what? It's not
my birthday or anything.

00:08:34.264 --> 00:08:35.724 align:middle
[KANNA]
Because it's Father's Day.

00:08:35.807 --> 00:08:37.976 align:middle
Oh. You think I'm a father now?

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:38.977 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:40.228 align:middle
Like, instead of a mother?

00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:41.354 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm.

00:08:46.985 --> 00:08:48.820 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI coughing]

00:08:48.903 --> 00:08:51.156 align:middle
Oh no, what's the matter,
Miss Kobayashi?

00:08:51.239 --> 00:08:53.450 align:middle
Tohru, I do believe
I've caught a cold.

00:08:53.533 --> 00:08:55.035 align:middle
A cold?

00:08:55.118 --> 00:08:57.162 align:middle
I've heard that phrase before,
but I still don't understand.

00:08:57.245 --> 00:08:59.414 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] You mean dragons
don't catch colds?

00:08:59.497 --> 00:09:02.042 align:middle
There's no way a tiny human
virus could survive inside

the furnace that is my body.

00:09:04.002 --> 00:09:05.628 align:middle
Must be nice.

00:09:05.712 --> 00:09:07.881 align:middle
Well, time for me to go to work.

00:09:07.964 --> 00:09:09.591 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Uh. Are you well enough to go?

00:09:09.674 --> 00:09:11.051 align:middle
That's cute. Like
they'd ever let me

00:09:11.134 --> 00:09:12.761 align:middle
take off work
for something as minor

00:09:12.844 --> 00:09:13.887 align:middle
as my heal--

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.555 align:middle
Wuh... Uh...

00:09:15.638 --> 00:09:16.723 align:middle

Should I bang on your chest

[KOBAYASHI]
I pray that you won't...

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.817 align:middle
But I won't be able
to go in to work,

00:09:27.901 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle
so I need to call
and let them know...

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.821 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]
I'll do it for you!

00:09:31.905 --> 00:09:34.449 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Oh no. Well, let her
know I have everything

00:09:34.532 --> 00:09:37.118 align:middle
under control and we
hope she feels better.

00:09:42.624 --> 00:09:45.710 align:middle
and already fell asleep,
but is there anything else

00:09:45.794 --> 00:09:48.129 align:middle
I can do for her?

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle
I'm afraid I don't have much
experience with sick humans,

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.634 align:middle
so I'm not sure what
would help her most.

00:09:52.717 --> 00:09:55.136 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Hmm... You could
always try to shrink the germs

00:09:55.220 --> 00:09:57.055 align:middle
so that they're easier to kill?

00:09:57.138 --> 00:09:59.516 align:middle
[TOHRU] I could do that,
but I'd likely destroy her body

00:09:59.599 --> 00:10:01.017 align:middle
in the process.

00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:03.228 align:middle
--[TAKIYA] Then maybe...
--[TOHRU] Hmm...

00:10:03.311 --> 00:10:04.729 align:middle
"Be her nurse"?

00:10:04.813 --> 00:10:06.314 align:middle
[TAKIYA] That's right.
What's important is--

00:10:06.398 --> 00:10:07.816 align:middle
[TOHRU]
I get it now!

00:10:07.899 --> 00:10:11.277 align:middle
What she needs is a healthy dose
of multi-vita-maid power!

00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:13.613 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi needs me
and I will do everything I can

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:18.034 align:middle
to help! I will protect her body
and destroy her viral enemy!

00:10:18.118 --> 00:10:21.746 align:middle
So, um. Is that right?
What do nurses do?

00:10:22.956 --> 00:10:25.000 align:middle
Why don't you just feed her
something that can detoxify

00:10:25.083 --> 00:10:28.336 align:middle
her insides? Like charcoal
or some yummy limestone?

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.088 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi
isn't a fire dragon

00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:32.674 align:middle
or a brick oven for that matter.

00:10:32.757 --> 00:10:34.926 align:middle
I know plenty of ways to
bring about human illness,

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:37.095 align:middle
but I know nothing
about curing them.

00:10:37.178 --> 00:10:39.848 align:middle
[TOHRU] You should learn
to fend them off, too!

00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:41.516 align:middle
All you have to do is
feed her something

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:43.685 align:middle
that's easily digested,
keep her head cool,

00:10:43.768 --> 00:10:46.396 align:middle
and then wipe her sweat
when it gets gross.

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:48.273 align:middle
[TOHRU] Thank you. The fact
that it takes three attempts

00:10:48.356 --> 00:10:51.776 align:middle
to get a reasonable answer says
a lot about who my friends are.

00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:55.405 align:middle
I wonder what she means
by "easily digested."

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.115 align:middle
Let's see...

00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:58.742 align:middle
I can digest just
about anything,

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.202 align:middle
so it's hard to
know what's good.

00:11:01.286 --> 00:11:02.495 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Rice gruel?

00:11:02.579 --> 00:11:04.539 align:middle
That looks like
it's easy to make.

00:11:04.622 --> 00:11:05.915 align:middle
We need yogurt.

00:11:05.999 --> 00:11:08.793 align:middle
I think I saw Kanna
put some in the fridge.

00:11:08.877 --> 00:11:11.713 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Udon, gelatin, bananas...

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.965 align:middle
Hmm, that just
leaves something sweet.

00:11:14.049 --> 00:11:15.675 align:middle
--[KOBAYASHI gasps]
--[TOHRU] Bone apple tea!

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:17.385 align:middle
Yummy rice gruel!

00:11:17.469 --> 00:11:19.387 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] She went out of
her way to make it for me,

00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:23.224 align:middle
so I guess it would be rude to
say it looks too weird to eat.

00:11:23.308 --> 00:11:25.643 align:middle
Now's probably not the best
time to teach her the concept

00:11:25.727 --> 00:11:27.479 align:middle
of foods that go well together.

00:11:27.562 --> 00:11:29.064 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI whimpers]

00:11:29.147 --> 00:11:32.317 align:middle
[gasps]
I'm so glad you like it!

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:35.028 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI sighs]
Next time, all you have to do

00:11:35.111 --> 00:11:36.946 align:middle
is follow the recipe.

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:37.989 align:middle
Promise?

00:11:38.073 --> 00:11:39.908 align:middle
Okay!

00:11:39.991 --> 00:11:41.826 align:middle
[panting]

00:11:41.910 --> 00:11:43.161 align:middle
[groans]

00:11:43.244 --> 00:11:45.538 align:middle
It seems like you're
sweating an awful lot.

00:11:45.622 --> 00:11:47.207 align:middle
Would you mind if I
wiped it off for you?

00:11:47.290 --> 00:11:48.792 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh...?

00:11:48.875 --> 00:11:50.710 align:middle
[groans]

00:11:55.799 --> 00:11:57.092 align:middle
[TOHRU]
What is happening?

00:11:57.175 --> 00:11:58.968 align:middle
My heart is racing
all of a sudden.

00:11:59.052 --> 00:12:01.388 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI groaning]

00:12:01.471 --> 00:12:04.683 align:middle
[panting]

00:12:04.766 --> 00:12:06.476 align:middle
[TOHRU] Miss Kobayashi
always comes off as

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.937 align:middle
such a strong, reliable person.

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:12.273 align:middle
This is my first time
seeing her so vulnerable.

00:12:13.566 --> 00:12:16.695 align:middle
She's gonna be okay...
isn't she...?

00:12:16.778 --> 00:12:19.739 align:middle
I've known whole villages
destroyed by epidemics.

00:12:19.823 --> 00:12:22.575 align:middle
I've seen entire nations
wiped out by them, too.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.619 align:middle
[panting]

00:12:24.703 --> 00:12:28.415 align:middle
You're gonna get better.
I just wish I knew for sure.

00:12:28.498 --> 00:12:31.292 align:middle
I don't want anything
that's precious to me destroyed,

00:12:31.376 --> 00:12:34.379 align:middle
but I suppose everything
breaks eventually.

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:37.590 align:middle
That's especially true around
me since I can break

00:12:37.674 --> 00:12:39.384 align:middle
just about anything.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:41.094 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hmm.

00:12:41.177 --> 00:12:42.554 align:middle
All right!

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:44.305 align:middle
I'm home!

00:12:44.389 --> 00:12:45.849 align:middle
--[TOHRU] Hello, Kanna.
--[KANNA] Huh?

00:12:45.932 --> 00:12:47.726 align:middle
[TOHRU] Please watch
over Miss Kobayashi.

00:12:47.809 --> 00:12:49.436 align:middle
[KANNA]
Mm-hmm.

00:12:53.231 --> 00:12:55.483 align:middle
[TOHRU] There are medicines
that grant immortality,

00:12:55.567 --> 00:12:58.111 align:middle
but I know Miss Kobayashi
would never go for those.

00:12:58.194 --> 00:12:59.821 align:middle
I have to at least find
something that can cure

00:12:59.904 --> 00:13:01.614 align:middle
the illness she has.

00:13:01.698 --> 00:13:04.993 align:middle
That might be harder
to find out here, but...

00:13:05.076 --> 00:13:07.162 align:middle
...I'll do it!

00:13:07.245 --> 00:13:09.372 align:middle
I won't let you down,
Miss Kobayashi!

00:13:09.456 --> 00:13:11.207 align:middle
Hang in there!

00:13:14.169 --> 00:13:15.253 align:middle
[ELVES grunting]

00:13:22.886 --> 00:13:24.095 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, man.

00:13:24.179 --> 00:13:26.765 align:middle
I feel so much better
after some good rest.

00:13:26.848 --> 00:13:28.641 align:middle
Better? Are you not well?

00:13:28.725 --> 00:13:30.977 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] I'll be okay after I
get some medicine and some sleep

00:13:31.061 --> 00:13:32.187 align:middle
for a few days.

00:13:32.270 --> 00:13:33.563 align:middle
That's amazing!

00:13:33.646 --> 00:13:35.648 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm? Where's Tohru?

00:13:37.067 --> 00:13:40.070 align:middle
--There you are.
--[TOHRU panting]

00:13:40.153 --> 00:13:43.239 align:middle
What's the matter?
You look exhausted.

00:13:43.323 --> 00:13:44.908 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Here you go...

00:13:44.991 --> 00:13:47.660 align:middle
I searched everywhere...

00:13:47.744 --> 00:13:49.829 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Um, what is that?

00:13:49.913 --> 00:13:53.291 align:middle
Its medicine that's supposed
to be very effective for colds.

00:13:53.375 --> 00:13:54.834 align:middle
'Kay, but is it safe?

00:13:54.918 --> 00:13:57.504 align:middle
There's nothing weird like
chicken breath, is the--

00:14:01.091 --> 00:14:02.509 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm.

00:14:04.135 --> 00:14:06.721 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Thanks. I'll try them.

00:14:06.805 --> 00:14:08.973 align:middle
[gulping]

00:14:12.268 --> 00:14:15.063 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm. They work.

00:14:15.146 --> 00:14:18.191 align:middle
You mean that...? Really?

00:14:18.274 --> 00:14:19.943 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm. This is incredible!

00:14:20.026 --> 00:14:22.362 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]
Oh, thank goodness!

00:14:22.445 --> 00:14:27.325 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Honestly, I don't
know if it's working or not.

00:14:27.409 --> 00:14:30.245 align:middle
But that look on her face has
to be some of the best medicine

00:14:30.328 --> 00:14:31.746 align:middle
in the world.

00:14:33.498 --> 00:14:35.083 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey, Tohru? Thank you.

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:37.002 align:middle
[TOHRU giggles]

00:14:39.129 --> 00:14:41.423 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Tohru!

00:14:41.506 --> 00:14:44.217 align:middle
What the heck is on my head and
growing out of my face?!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.387 align:middle
Uh-oh. Maybe it's a side effect?

00:14:47.470 --> 00:14:50.140 align:middle
The medicine was for beast-folk.

00:14:50.223 --> 00:14:51.433 align:middle
But you look cute.

00:14:51.516 --> 00:14:54.019 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI snarls]
How am I supposed to go

00:14:54.102 --> 00:14:55.895 align:middle
to work like this?!

00:15:01.568 --> 00:15:03.194 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm, hmm!

00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:05.321 align:middle
--Meow! Meow!
--[KANNA] Ahh. Ahh!

00:15:05.405 --> 00:15:07.115 align:middle
So cute!

00:15:08.908 --> 00:15:12.037 align:middle
[ILULU humming]

00:15:16.499 --> 00:15:17.959 align:middle
[ILULU]
That's a doll.

00:15:19.127 --> 00:15:20.462 align:middle
Did someone leave it?

00:15:20.545 --> 00:15:23.798 align:middle
It looks expensive
and very good quality.

00:15:23.882 --> 00:15:26.009 align:middle
I think she's pretty.

00:15:26.092 --> 00:15:28.553 align:middle
We should probably
return it, right?

00:15:28.636 --> 00:15:31.014 align:middle
[TAKETO] I bet they'll be
by tomorrow to pick it up.

00:15:34.059 --> 00:15:35.477 align:middle
[TAKETO]
No one showed up for it.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.937 align:middle
Then I'll have
to go look for them.

00:15:39.189 --> 00:15:41.149 align:middle
I should ask around, first.

00:15:41.232 --> 00:15:42.650 align:middle
You're coming, too, right?

00:15:42.734 --> 00:15:44.319 align:middle
If I don't, I'll just worry.

00:15:44.402 --> 00:15:46.237 align:middle
[ILULU]
Ah? Hey!

00:15:46.321 --> 00:15:49.366 align:middle
Ah? Oh! It's the
candy shop lady!

00:15:49.449 --> 00:15:51.534 align:middle
[ILULU] Do you know
whose doll this might be?

00:15:51.618 --> 00:15:52.869 align:middle
I don't.

00:15:52.952 --> 00:15:54.371 align:middle
Okay.

00:15:54.454 --> 00:15:56.206 align:middle
Are you and Mister Taketo
together? Because it kinda looks

00:15:56.289 --> 00:15:57.248 align:middle
like he's your boyfriend.

00:15:57.332 --> 00:15:58.792 align:middle
Huh?! What are
you talking about?!

00:15:58.875 --> 00:16:00.210 align:middle
Of course we're not together!

00:16:00.293 --> 00:16:01.670 align:middle
Um, yes, we are.

00:16:01.753 --> 00:16:04.005 align:middle
You said you wanted to go
together to find the owner.

00:16:04.089 --> 00:16:05.548 align:middle
That's not what she meant!

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:08.176 align:middle
[gasps]
Let's try asking that kid, too!

00:16:08.259 --> 00:16:11.846 align:middle
[TAKETO sighs]
She's not listening...

00:16:11.930 --> 00:16:13.473 align:middle
I guess she's an orphan...

00:16:13.556 --> 00:16:16.351 align:middle
It's just hard to track down
one specific person.

00:16:16.434 --> 00:16:17.894 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm...

00:16:17.977 --> 00:16:20.021 align:middle
Maybe they didn't forget it,
but intentionally left it

00:16:20.105 --> 00:16:21.731 align:middle
at the store for
someone to find.

00:16:21.815 --> 00:16:23.066 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:23.149 --> 00:16:24.401 align:middle
Mm.

00:16:27.195 --> 00:16:29.406 align:middle
No, I'll find them!

00:16:38.289 --> 00:16:39.833 align:middle
[ILULU sighs]

00:16:39.916 --> 00:16:41.209 align:middle
We've looked everywhere.

00:16:41.292 --> 00:16:44.045 align:middle
I think we should
turn it over to the police.

00:16:44.129 --> 00:16:45.630 align:middle
[ILULU groans]

00:16:45.714 --> 00:16:48.216 align:middle
Is there anybody else you know
that you think we should ask?

00:16:48.299 --> 00:16:49.342 align:middle
[gasps]

00:16:50.218 --> 00:16:51.553 align:middle
[ILULU] I brought us
someone to help out!

00:16:51.636 --> 00:16:52.804 align:middle
This is Kobayashi!

00:16:52.887 --> 00:16:54.347 align:middle
Hey there.

00:16:54.431 --> 00:16:56.850 align:middle
I heard what's going on, but I
don't think there's anything

00:16:56.933 --> 00:16:58.268 align:middle
I can do, Ilulu.

00:16:58.351 --> 00:17:01.021 align:middle
Please! If anyone
can help, it's you!

00:17:01.104 --> 00:17:03.732 align:middle
[TAKETO] So this is the
Kobayashi that Ilulu mentioned?

00:17:03.815 --> 00:17:05.275 align:middle
She looks normal...

00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.278 align:middle
...but what's with that
blonde maid behind her?

00:17:08.361 --> 00:17:11.031 align:middle
She's totally chill,
like she's used to all this.

00:17:11.114 --> 00:17:12.782 align:middle
Does she wear
that uniform every day?

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:15.326 align:middle
This woman is
definitely bad news!

00:17:15.410 --> 00:17:18.997 align:middle
Let's take a picture of it
and post it on the internet.

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:21.249 align:middle
But you know what would be even
more helpful is if you could use

00:17:21.332 --> 00:17:23.793 align:middle
your magic powers to sharpen
your sense of smell.

00:17:23.877 --> 00:17:26.171 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm. Oh, right!

00:17:26.254 --> 00:17:27.756 align:middle
--[sniffing]
--Huh?!

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:30.133 align:middle
Why are you suddenly
forcing her into puppy play?!

00:17:30.216 --> 00:17:31.301 align:middle
Huh? I'm not.

00:17:31.384 --> 00:17:32.761 align:middle
Have you been training her
this whole time?

00:17:32.844 --> 00:17:34.387 align:middle
--[KOBAYASHI] Slow down!
--You're wrong!

00:17:34.471 --> 00:17:36.264 align:middle
--None of that is true!
--Huh?

00:17:36.348 --> 00:17:38.475 align:middle
The only one allowed
to receive training is me!

00:17:38.558 --> 00:17:40.226 align:middle
You're making it worse!
Shut up!

00:17:40.310 --> 00:17:42.228 align:middle
Okay. Think I've got the scent.

00:17:42.312 --> 00:17:44.564 align:middle
You what? Hold on.

00:17:46.066 --> 00:17:48.651 align:middle
[sniffing]
Hmm.

00:17:48.735 --> 00:17:50.278 align:middle
[FRIEND 208A]
Ilulu!

00:17:50.362 --> 00:17:52.322 align:middle
Here. This is for you.

00:17:52.405 --> 00:17:54.240 align:middle
[ILULU]
What is it? Are you sure?

00:17:54.324 --> 00:17:56.201 align:middle
[FRIEND 208A] Mm-hmm! I made it
just for you, Ilulu.

00:17:56.284 --> 00:17:57.786 align:middle
I hope you like it.

00:17:57.869 --> 00:18:00.580 align:middle
Thank you so much!
I'll cherish it always!

00:18:00.663 --> 00:18:02.165 align:middle
[giggles]

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:12.258 align:middle
[TAKETO] Hey. Do you know
where we're going?

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:14.552 align:middle
We're heading into
the next town over.

00:18:14.636 --> 00:18:17.430 align:middle
I'm sorry you followed
me this far already.

00:18:17.514 --> 00:18:20.016 align:middle
You can go home if you want.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle
Are you sure?

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.186 align:middle
Okay.

00:18:23.269 --> 00:18:24.187 align:middle
See ya.

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:25.605 align:middle
[ILULU]
Yeah.

00:18:28.775 --> 00:18:31.069 align:middle
--[thunder rumbles]
--[TAKETO grunts]

00:18:34.698 --> 00:18:36.366 align:middle
[ILULU]
Is it still farther?

00:18:37.826 --> 00:18:39.869 align:middle
[ILULU] Did they really
mean to leave it?

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.081 align:middle
[ILULU] It was still warm
when I picked it up.

00:18:43.164 --> 00:18:46.167 align:middle
They must've been holding it
until that moment.

00:18:50.088 --> 00:18:52.632 align:middle
[ILULU grunts]
What do I do?!

00:18:52.716 --> 00:18:53.800 align:middle
It'll get wet!

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.845 align:middle
No. The scent's
starting to fade, too!

00:18:56.928 --> 00:18:59.097 align:middle
[grunts]

00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:03.018 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:19:07.105 --> 00:19:09.983 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:10.066 --> 00:19:12.610 align:middle
I thought you went home.

00:19:12.694 --> 00:19:15.155 align:middle
It was getting cloudy.

00:19:15.238 --> 00:19:17.323 align:middle
I figured it was going to rain.

00:19:21.327 --> 00:19:23.538 align:middle
Listen. Long ago,

00:19:23.621 --> 00:19:27.334 align:middle
I abandoned a doll like this,
one that I loved very much.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:31.212 align:middle
[ILULU]
I regret leaving it.

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:33.798 align:middle
I'd go back and
get it if I could.

00:19:36.343 --> 00:19:38.219 align:middle
And I'm pretty positive...

00:19:38.303 --> 00:19:40.680 align:middle
...someone feels
the same for her.

00:19:46.728 --> 00:19:51.107 align:middle
Well then, we need to make
sure that we find her owner.

00:19:51.191 --> 00:19:52.442 align:middle
Really?

00:19:54.361 --> 00:19:57.655 align:middle
Oh. Found her.
She's over there!

00:19:59.574 --> 00:20:00.575 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Ilulu!

00:20:00.658 --> 00:20:02.077 align:middle
Hello, Kobayashi.

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.371 align:middle
[TAKETO] Uh. Where did
she just come from?

00:20:04.454 --> 00:20:06.247 align:middle
Turns out that doll
was a custom order,

00:20:06.331 --> 00:20:09.209 align:middle
so I was able to pin down the
store that originally made it.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:11.044 align:middle
When I asked them about the
owners, they said they visited

00:20:11.127 --> 00:20:13.088 align:middle
the shop often for maintenance.

00:20:13.171 --> 00:20:15.298 align:middle
So that means they
remembered them fondly.

00:20:15.382 --> 00:20:16.800 align:middle
Ah. So then...

00:20:16.883 --> 00:20:19.094 align:middle
So your doll's
no longer homeless.

00:20:19.177 --> 00:20:20.804 align:middle
And they said
we could bring it by.

00:20:20.887 --> 00:20:22.180 align:middle
Here, I've got their address.

00:20:22.263 --> 00:20:23.390 align:middle
[gasps]

00:20:23.473 --> 00:20:25.517 align:middle
Just who are you, anyway?

00:20:28.353 --> 00:20:31.147 align:middle
[OWNER 208A] I'm sorry for
causing you so much trouble.

00:20:31.231 --> 00:20:34.359 align:middle
You see...
I left it there on purpose.

00:20:34.442 --> 00:20:35.944 align:middle
I thought,
maybe when you found it,

00:20:36.027 --> 00:20:38.029 align:middle
that you'd put it on display.

00:20:38.113 --> 00:20:40.782 align:middle
I'm in high school now and
my friends were teasing me.

00:20:40.865 --> 00:20:44.160 align:middle
They told me it was childish and
I had to throw it away or else.

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:45.328 align:middle
But I...

00:20:45.412 --> 00:20:47.997 align:middle
I've regretted it
ever since I left her.

00:20:48.081 --> 00:20:50.000 align:middle
I know it's too late now...

00:20:50.083 --> 00:20:51.418 align:middle
That's not true.

00:20:51.501 --> 00:20:53.628 align:middle
If you can take her back,
then you should.

[OWNER 208A whimpering]

00:20:55.213 --> 00:20:58.258 align:middle
[ILULU] I'm sure she'd love it
if you welcomed her home.

I'm sorry...

[sobbing, sniffing]

00:21:07.976 --> 00:21:09.561 align:middle
Welcome home...

00:21:11.563 --> 00:21:12.689 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Come on, Ilulu!

00:21:12.772 --> 00:21:14.232 align:middle
It's time for you
to take a bath.

00:21:14.315 --> 00:21:15.900 align:middle
[ILULU]
'Kay!

00:21:15.984 --> 00:21:18.069 align:middle
Well, thanks.
That was very nice of you.

00:21:18.153 --> 00:21:19.946 align:middle
I appreciate you going with her.

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.990 align:middle
Well, uh, I didn't really wan--

00:21:22.073 --> 00:21:24.242 align:middle
[ILULU] Take! Don't you
need a bath, too?

00:21:24.325 --> 00:21:25.660 align:middle
Take one with me!

00:21:25.744 --> 00:21:27.829 align:middle
[TAKETO] What are you doing?!
Go put your clothes on!

00:21:27.912 --> 00:21:29.664 align:middle
[ILULU]
I told you, I'm taking a bath!

00:21:29.748 --> 00:21:31.458 align:middle
You have to take your
clothes off for that!

00:21:31.541 --> 00:21:33.251 align:middle
Okay! But leave me alone!

Miss Kobayashi...

00:21:41.301 --> 00:21:42.635 align:middle
[ILULU]
Ta-da!

00:21:42.719 --> 00:21:44.304 align:middle
--It's you! But as a cute doll!
--[TAKETO whimpering]

00:21:44.387 --> 00:21:45.555 align:middle
You like it?

00:21:45.638 --> 00:21:48.058 align:middle
No, it's weird!
And why is it in your shirt?!

00:21:48.141 --> 00:21:49.684 align:middle
'Cause he finds it comforting.

00:21:49.768 --> 00:21:51.061 align:middle
Comforting how?!

00:21:51.144 --> 00:21:53.938 align:middle
Uh? Come here, I'll show you.

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:56.900 align:middle

Huh?! You're out of control!

00:23:28.158 --> 00:23:29.617 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Ilulu, how's your part time job?

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:31.578 align:middle
[ILULU] It's fun! We have a
visitor that comes around

00:23:31.661 --> 00:23:33.455 align:middle
--all the time.
--[KOBAYASHI] A regular, huh?

00:23:33.538 --> 00:23:35.290 align:middle
[ILULU] Yeah. But sometimes,
they try to get a free meal

00:23:35.373 --> 00:23:36.708 align:middle
and put us in a spot.

00:23:36.791 --> 00:23:38.501 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh. Is that person doing okay?

00:23:38.585 --> 00:23:40.503 align:middle
[ILULU]
It's not a person, it's a cat.
