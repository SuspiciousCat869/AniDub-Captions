[LUCOA]
Okay, spill.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.100 align:middle
Why would you ask me
to come here of all places?

00:00:18.601 --> 00:00:20.478 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Well, Fafnir?

00:00:21.521 --> 00:00:22.939 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Lend me your power.

00:00:23.023 --> 00:00:25.358 align:middle
[gasps]
What's this about?

00:00:25.442 --> 00:00:27.193 align:middle
Since when do you rely
on others for anything

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.821 align:middle
besides gaming
cheats or whatever?

00:00:29.904 --> 00:00:31.364 align:middle
Doesn't matter.

00:00:31.448 --> 00:00:34.200 align:middle
I know it doesn't seem like it,
but I'm pretty busy.

00:00:34.284 --> 00:00:36.119 align:middle
You're just gonna
have to ask someone else.

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.370 align:middle
--[FAFNIR] All right.
--Hey!

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.956 align:middle
You're supposed to beg
before walking away!

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:15.218 align:middle
[LUCOA]
What's this for?

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.345 align:middle
--Weird.
--A manga.

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.222 align:middle
What for? And why?

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:21.558 align:middle
There's a doujinshi
exhibition coming up soon,

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:23.184 align:middle
and I plan to sell it there.

00:02:23.268 --> 00:02:25.186 align:middle
Ah! Hold on!

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.022 align:middle
You mean you're
gonna draw it yourself?!

00:02:27.105 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle
[FAFNIR] The last time
I attempted a sale,

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:29.774 align:middle
my book was text-only.

00:02:29.858 --> 00:02:31.860 align:middle
And Takiya said that's why
I was crushed royally.

00:02:31.943 --> 00:02:32.861 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Ah...

00:02:32.944 --> 00:02:34.195 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
So, I'm adding artwork.

00:02:34.279 --> 00:02:35.947 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Here's what I don't get.

00:02:36.031 --> 00:02:39.242 align:middle
Why are you so hard up to sell
a book at this place so badly?

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:40.577 align:middle
Because treasure...

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.996 align:middle
Uh, what?

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.749 align:middle
It was an ordinary day...

00:02:45.832 --> 00:02:47.959 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Hey Faf-kun...

00:02:48.043 --> 00:02:49.753 align:middle
You're a fan of
treasure, aren't you?

00:02:49.836 --> 00:02:51.171 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Sure.

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:53.048 align:middle
How would you feel about
creating it yourself, then?

00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:55.216 align:middle
Like DIY treasure?

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.760 align:middle
Please elaborate.

00:02:56.843 --> 00:02:59.637 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Well, when you
create something yourself,

00:02:59.721 --> 00:03:01.139 align:middle
it becomes that
much more valuable,

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:02.849 align:middle
so imagine how much
treasure would be worth

00:03:02.932 --> 00:03:04.267 align:middle
if you created it.

00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:05.643 align:middle
Ah.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.313 align:middle
[LUCOA]
I see.

00:03:08.396 --> 00:03:11.066 align:middle
So you took that investment
advice and made a book.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:12.901 align:middle
Is that why you want my power?

00:03:12.984 --> 00:03:14.319 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Yes.

00:03:14.402 --> 00:03:16.780 align:middle
Next time, skip the flashbacks
and just ask me, 'kay?

00:03:16.863 --> 00:03:19.074 align:middle
Of course! I'd love to help you!

00:03:19.157 --> 00:03:21.951 align:middle
So, what do you want me to do?
Blotting? Crosshatching?

00:03:22.035 --> 00:03:25.372 align:middle
Wow, you know a lot.
But no, not that.

00:03:25.455 --> 00:03:28.124 align:middle
Members of my online community
say it's standard for books

00:03:28.208 --> 00:03:31.127 align:middle
like these to feature erotic
and vulgar women.

00:03:31.211 --> 00:03:32.587 align:middle
So what I'm asking...

00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.714 align:middle
...is that you model
for my artwork.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:40.053 align:middle
An art model?!
I've never done that before!

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:41.721 align:middle
Wait, rewind a second.

00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:43.598 align:middle
I'm pretty sure you
used the term "vulgar."

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:45.141 align:middle
Is that how you see me?

00:03:45.225 --> 00:03:47.852 align:middle
Undeniably. I can't think
of anyone better suited

00:03:47.936 --> 00:03:49.062 align:middle
for the role.

00:03:49.145 --> 00:03:50.939 align:middle
[LUCOA] You said that
right to my face...

00:03:51.022 --> 00:03:52.565 align:middle
[FAFNIR] Here is
the outline of the story.

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:53.566 align:middle
[LUCOA groans]

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.026 align:middle
Mm...

00:03:56.361 --> 00:03:57.696 align:middle
This says that
your main character

00:03:57.779 --> 00:03:59.406 align:middle
is an elementary school boy.

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.324 align:middle
Oh, and a gorgeous, older woman!

00:04:01.408 --> 00:04:03.785 align:middle
Wait, that's just
like me and Shouta!

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:05.745 align:middle

you going to do me?

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.373 align:middle

Whoa, what is this crap?

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.713 align:middle
This woman is
pure nightmare fuel!

00:04:14.796 --> 00:04:16.798 align:middle
I mean, poor,
precious baby boy!

00:04:16.881 --> 00:04:18.299 align:middle
You are correct.

00:04:18.383 --> 00:04:20.093 align:middle
But the main plot is coming up.

00:04:20.176 --> 00:04:21.720 align:middle
[LUCOA groans] Okay,
so somehow they find a way

00:04:21.803 --> 00:04:23.096 align:middle
to fall in love, right?

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:24.556 align:middle
[BOY 207A]
Damn that woman!

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle
But why?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.519 align:middle
Why can't I stop
thinking about her?

00:04:29.602 --> 00:04:31.354 align:middle
Oh! I know!

00:04:31.438 --> 00:04:32.897 align:middle
[LUCOA gulps]

00:04:32.981 --> 00:04:36.609 align:middle
[BOY 207A] Because... I want
to curse that woman to death!

00:04:36.693 --> 00:04:38.570 align:middle
I'll curse that woman!

00:04:46.453 --> 00:04:48.496 align:middle

So uh, Fafnir?

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.998 align:middle
Lucoa?

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.833 align:middle
[LUCOA] All the pages after
this one have the young boy

00:04:51.916 --> 00:04:55.754 align:middle
casting endless curses
upon the beautiful woman?

00:04:55.837 --> 00:04:58.506 align:middle
[FAFNIR] Yes, that is
the main focus of my vision.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.384 align:middle
I don't think humans are gonna
understand your intention here.

00:05:01.468 --> 00:05:02.886 align:middle
At all.

00:05:02.969 --> 00:05:05.638 align:middle
Right. I need a rough draft.
Go ahead and try some poses.

00:05:05.722 --> 00:05:07.599 align:middle

[LUCOA sighs]

00:05:19.903 --> 00:05:22.280 align:middle
[FAFNIR] All right, next,
I need poses for the curses.

00:05:22.364 --> 00:05:24.199 align:middle
Huh?! We're doing those, too?

00:05:24.282 --> 00:05:25.784 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Are you serious?

00:05:25.867 --> 00:05:28.578 align:middle
Do you know of another reason
why I would've bowed my head?

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.080 align:middle
[LUCOA]
I didn't see it...

00:05:30.163 --> 00:05:31.456 align:middle
Fine.

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:32.916 align:middle
How's this?

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:34.542 align:middle
"I'm in pain!"

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:36.086 align:middle
[FAFNIR snarls]
What's going on?!

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:37.462 align:middle
Are you mocking me?!

00:05:37.545 --> 00:05:39.089 align:middle
I need to see bloodshot eyes
and your neck twisted

00:05:42.008 --> 00:05:44.177 align:middle
Tch! You're my only hope.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.179 align:middle
No one else can
pull it off so perfectly.

00:05:46.262 --> 00:05:48.640 align:middle
[LUCOA] I'm not sure
I like that endorsement!

00:05:48.723 --> 00:05:51.267 align:middle

That's brilliant!

00:05:52.686 --> 00:05:54.437 align:middle
Now spin your arms
in irregular directions

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.272 align:middle
and then try to fly
with them broken!

00:05:56.356 --> 00:05:57.482 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Oh. Sure!

00:05:57.565 --> 00:05:58.900 align:middle
Now, split your chest
into three parts!

Of course. Why wouldn't I?

00:06:00.527 --> 00:06:02.112 align:middle

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:04.114 align:middle

00:08:44.774 --> 00:08:46.192 align:middle
Oh, that's right!

00:08:46.276 --> 00:08:47.986 align:middle
[TOHRU] She's like a warrior
fresh from the battlefield.

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.905 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI sighs] Sunny days
like this are my favorite

00:08:50.989 --> 00:08:52.657 align:middle
for sleeping in.

00:08:52.741 --> 00:08:54.993 align:middle
Speaking of which,
do you ever get tired?

00:08:55.076 --> 00:08:57.829 align:middle
Not really. Dragons
aren't prone to sleeping.

00:08:57.912 --> 00:08:59.497 align:middle
Fafnir stayed awake
for thousands of years

00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:01.082 align:middle
to protect his treasure.

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.960 align:middle
We find that sleep gets in the
way of more important things.

00:09:04.044 --> 00:09:06.463 align:middle
Analog security.
How impressive.

00:09:06.546 --> 00:09:08.089 align:middle
[TOHRU] Actually,
I do tend to get sleepy

00:09:08.173 --> 00:09:10.008 align:middle
during the cold season.

00:09:10.091 --> 00:09:11.551 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh, like hibernation.

00:09:11.634 --> 00:09:13.094 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Is that what you call it?

00:09:13.178 --> 00:09:15.930 align:middle
At times, I've fallen into a
deep sleep and remained that way

00:09:16.014 --> 00:09:17.390 align:middle
for most of the winter.

00:09:17.474 --> 00:09:19.392 align:middle
And I usually can't
wake up without a strong,

00:09:19.476 --> 00:09:20.810 align:middle
personal trigger.

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.145 align:middle
What triggers you?

00:09:22.228 --> 00:09:24.022 align:middle
[TOHRU] You know,
like the world suddenly becoming

00:09:24.105 --> 00:09:26.024 align:middle
full of malice, or
blood and miasma

00:09:26.107 --> 00:09:28.026 align:middle
seeping into the earth
and creating some foul

00:09:28.109 --> 00:09:29.903 align:middle
and unbearable odor! Uck!

00:09:29.986 --> 00:09:31.905 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] So I guess strong
coffee's out of the question?

00:09:31.988 --> 00:09:33.865 align:middle
I've noticed I am sleeping
a lot more ever since

00:09:33.948 --> 00:09:35.408 align:middle
living in this world with you.

00:09:35.492 --> 00:09:37.494 align:middle
You're adapting
to our lifestyle?

00:09:37.577 --> 00:09:38.995 align:middle
That's part of it, yeah.

00:09:39.079 --> 00:09:42.290 align:middle
But strangely enough,
I want to sleep sometimes.

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:44.334 align:middle
There's a reason behind it, too.

00:09:44.417 --> 00:09:48.421 align:middle
Huh... Speaking of sleeping
a lot, where's Kanna?

00:09:48.505 --> 00:09:49.798 align:middle
Over there, snoozin'.

00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:52.300 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm? Oh. Aw...

00:09:52.384 --> 00:09:53.968 align:middle
[BOTH snoring]

00:09:54.052 --> 00:09:57.013 align:middle
[TOHRU] Come on, you two.
Time to wake up.

00:09:57.097 --> 00:09:59.724 align:middle
[ILULU, KANNA groaning]

00:09:59.808 --> 00:10:01.142 align:middle
They have their own room,

00:10:01.226 --> 00:10:03.853 align:middle
I don't know why they don't
just go to bed in there.

00:10:03.937 --> 00:10:06.189 align:middle
[TOHRU] Neither of them were
able to sleep with their parents

00:10:06.272 --> 00:10:10.652 align:middle
in their world, so they're
indulging in that here with you.

00:10:10.735 --> 00:10:13.697 align:middle
I see. So was it
different for you?

00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:15.365 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Mm...

00:10:15.448 --> 00:10:19.327 align:middle
Yeah, I guess so. I was
pretty spoiled by my parents.

00:10:19.411 --> 00:10:21.037 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh...

00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:24.124 align:middle
All right, time to for me
to go back to sleep.

00:10:24.207 --> 00:10:26.209 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Wait, Miss Kobayashi!

00:10:26.292 --> 00:10:28.420 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Tohru, please...
This is my only joy...

00:10:28.503 --> 00:10:30.130 align:middle
Let me have it...

00:10:30.213 --> 00:10:33.425 align:middle
[TOHRU] She's impossible to
wake up when she gets like that.

00:10:33.508 --> 00:10:35.927 align:middle
Oh well, I guess I'll go
shopping for dinner.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:39.222 align:middle
--Uh--
--[ELMA] Hmm?

00:10:39.305 --> 00:10:40.849 align:middle
--[growls]
--[groans]

00:10:40.932 --> 00:10:43.101 align:middle
I'm cursed with bad luck
if I'm running into you.

00:10:43.184 --> 00:10:44.477 align:middle
That's what I was gonna say.

00:10:44.561 --> 00:10:46.396 align:middle
I know those bags
are full of sweets!

00:10:46.479 --> 00:10:49.024 align:middle
When did you stop being
a dragon and become a swine?!

00:10:49.107 --> 00:10:50.525 align:middle
[ELMA]
Back off, Tohru.

00:10:50.608 --> 00:10:53.194 align:middle
I'm too tired and overwhelmed
to process you right now.

00:10:54.446 --> 00:10:57.157 align:middle
So does that mean that you've
started to sleep here, too?

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.742 align:middle
It just started to
come naturally to me

00:10:58.825 --> 00:11:01.286 align:middle
the more I learned about
the way humans live.

00:11:01.369 --> 00:11:03.413 align:middle
Almost afraid to admit
I've been sleeping every night

00:11:03.496 --> 00:11:05.040 align:middle
since I came to this world.

00:11:05.123 --> 00:11:07.292 align:middle
I assume you've been
the same way?

00:11:07.375 --> 00:11:08.835 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Yeah...

00:11:08.918 --> 00:11:10.587 align:middle
It's strange
when you think about it.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:13.631 align:middle
I mean, where would this
sleepiness come from?

00:11:13.715 --> 00:11:16.885 align:middle
Do you think it's
a symptom of boredom...?

00:11:16.968 --> 00:11:18.511 align:middle
What are you saying?

00:11:18.595 --> 00:11:20.430 align:middle
You're feeling bored?

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:22.474 align:middle
Why don't you go back, then?

00:11:22.557 --> 00:11:26.186 align:middle
[TOHRU] Well, because...
I don't dislike being bored.

00:11:26.269 --> 00:11:28.146 align:middle
I mean, think about how
many years we had to fight

00:11:28.229 --> 00:11:31.649 align:middle
our battles without
actual sleep.

00:11:31.733 --> 00:11:33.943 align:middle
When I compare that feeling
to not having much to do

00:11:34.027 --> 00:11:36.321 align:middle
throughout the day,
I realize I actually enjoy

00:11:36.404 --> 00:11:39.074 align:middle
the mindless leisure. Don't you?

00:11:39.157 --> 00:11:40.575 align:middle
Tohru...

00:11:40.658 --> 00:11:42.869 align:middle
--Are we...
--Ugh!

00:11:42.952 --> 00:11:45.497 align:middle
Whatever. I wouldn't expect
a pig like you to understand!

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:46.873 align:middle
Agh!

00:11:46.956 --> 00:11:48.708 align:middle
[TOHRU] I hope you get
sold for at least 88 yen

00:11:48.792 --> 00:11:50.502 align:middle
per hundred grams
at the local butcher!

00:11:50.585 --> 00:11:53.546 align:middle
[ELMA] How dare you suggest
I'd ever be sold so cheap!

00:12:10.397 --> 00:12:12.941 align:middle
[TOHRU]
It's that time of night again.

00:12:13.024 --> 00:12:16.361 align:middle
Most humans are asleep,
and I can physically sense it.

00:12:18.988 --> 00:12:21.157 align:middle
[TOHRU] No matter where
I look, I see the signs

00:12:21.241 --> 00:12:23.868 align:middle
that confirm those feelings.

00:12:23.952 --> 00:12:27.038 align:middle
It's not that I dislike
this time of day.

00:12:27.122 --> 00:12:29.040 align:middle
It's reassuring to know
that so many humans

00:12:29.124 --> 00:12:32.502 align:middle
are safely resting
in their beds.

00:12:32.585 --> 00:12:34.379 align:middle
It's so quiet...

00:12:34.462 --> 00:12:36.756 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
It is quiet.

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:38.633 align:middle
You wanna nightcap?

00:12:38.717 --> 00:12:42.053 align:middle
I slept too much this
afternoon, so yeah...

00:12:42.137 --> 00:12:45.515 align:middle
Guess I'm up for a bit.
[sighs]

00:12:45.598 --> 00:12:47.559 align:middle
Hey, Miss Kobayashi,
I was wondering:

00:12:47.642 --> 00:12:50.353 align:middle
why do humans get sleepy?

00:12:50.437 --> 00:12:54.107 align:middle
We need sleep to live.
We'll die if we don't get it.

00:12:54.190 --> 00:12:56.234 align:middle
For some reason we chose
to be diurnal rather

00:12:56.317 --> 00:12:59.195 align:middle
than nocturnal
during our evolution.

00:12:59.279 --> 00:13:01.114 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hmm.

00:13:01.197 --> 00:13:04.451 align:middle
Guess that's not what you
were asking about, huh?

00:13:04.534 --> 00:13:08.163 align:middle
Well, maybe...
Maybe it's pressure to conform.

00:13:08.246 --> 00:13:11.041 align:middle
Like, just going along with
what everyone wants to do?

00:13:11.124 --> 00:13:12.292 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah.

00:13:12.375 --> 00:13:14.336 align:middle
Someone probably said,
"It's getting dark out

00:13:14.419 --> 00:13:17.797 align:middle
and we can't do anything anyway,
so let's just sleep."

00:13:17.881 --> 00:13:20.508 align:middle
Then, someone else agreed,
and so did their friends,

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.093 align:middle
and their friends' friends...

00:13:22.177 --> 00:13:24.304 align:middle
And when everyone's asleep,
it's kind of lonely

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:29.184 align:middle
being awake by yourself so,
everyone went to sleep together.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:31.853 align:middle
Or something like that.

00:13:31.936 --> 00:13:33.897 align:middle
Did I answer your question?

00:13:34.981 --> 00:13:37.400 align:middle
Yeah.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:40.445 align:middle
[TOHRU] So then, that would
mean I've also given in

00:13:40.528 --> 00:13:44.449 align:middle
to the pressure.
The pressure to conform.

00:13:49.537 --> 00:13:50.538 align:middle
[TOHRU breathing heavily]

00:13:50.622 --> 00:13:53.667 align:middle
[grunts]
I fell asleep...

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.294 align:middle
Mm? Ah!

00:13:56.378 --> 00:13:59.422 align:middle
[giggles]

00:14:00.548 --> 00:14:04.260 align:middle
Ah! Today's gonna
be a great day!

00:14:04.344 --> 00:14:07.013 align:middle
Good morning, Miss Kobayashi!

00:14:07.097 --> 00:14:09.808 align:middle
[screams]
I overslept!

00:14:15.522 --> 00:14:18.274 align:middle
[TEACHER 207A] Today, you'll be
investigating things in groups,

00:14:18.358 --> 00:14:20.568 align:middle
and we'll create
a class newspaper.

00:14:20.652 --> 00:14:23.780 align:middle
So let's have a discussion and
decide what your theme will be.

00:14:23.863 --> 00:14:25.115 align:middle
[KIDS]
'Kay!

00:14:26.116 --> 00:14:27.784 align:middle
We should investigate ghosts!

00:14:27.867 --> 00:14:30.328 align:middle
There've been rumors
about that lately.

00:14:30.412 --> 00:14:33.373 align:middle
They say a woman's screams were
heard from the art prep room.

00:14:33.456 --> 00:14:35.000 align:middle
That might be interesting!

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:37.085 align:middle
--Wow, ghosts.
--Ghosts...

00:14:38.962 --> 00:14:42.716 align:middle
[gasps]
I like that idea, too! Iomante!

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.009 align:middle
Kanna, don't say that!

00:14:44.092 --> 00:14:46.011 align:middle
There's no such thing
as ghosts anyway!

00:14:46.094 --> 00:14:48.471 align:middle
Precisely. How are we s'posed
to prove spirits exist

00:14:48.555 --> 00:14:49.556 align:middle
when we can't see them?

00:14:49.639 --> 00:14:50.932 align:middle
Dude! Come on!

00:14:51.016 --> 00:14:52.058 align:middle
Ow! That hurt.

00:14:52.142 --> 00:14:53.935 align:middle
Well, don't be dumb!
You know what?

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.395 align:middle
You're kind of an egghead.

00:14:55.478 --> 00:14:57.272 align:middle
You guys are all
just afraid of ghosts!

00:14:57.355 --> 00:14:59.566 align:middle
What?! Why would I
be afraid of them?!

00:14:59.649 --> 00:15:01.109 align:middle
They're not even for real.

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.487 align:middle
Truth. But I'm still willing
to accompany you for our story.

00:15:04.571 --> 00:15:06.072 align:middle
Come with us, too, Saikawa.

00:15:06.156 --> 00:15:07.741 align:middle
Ah...

00:15:07.824 --> 00:15:09.451 align:middle
Um. Arm twisted!

00:15:09.534 --> 00:15:12.495 align:middle
I guess I could go with you
but only to take care of Kanna!

00:15:12.579 --> 00:15:15.206 align:middle
All right! I guess
that's settled!

00:15:15.290 --> 00:15:17.208 align:middle
--[BOTH] Oh!
--[groans]

00:15:18.710 --> 00:15:20.879 align:middle
[HACHISUKA] If a ghost shows up,
I'll show it what's what!

00:15:20.962 --> 00:15:23.965 align:middle
Ghosts don't have bodies, so...
You can't show them.

00:15:24.049 --> 00:15:25.675 align:middle
--Hah!
--Stop that!

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:27.552 align:middle
It's just a figure of speech!

00:15:27.635 --> 00:15:29.763 align:middle
Some people think ghosts
show up in photos.

00:15:29.846 --> 00:15:31.097 align:middle
Are you gonna take some?

00:15:31.181 --> 00:15:33.767 align:middle
If I caught one and posted it,
it would go viral.

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:35.101 align:middle
Viral?

00:15:35.185 --> 00:15:37.437 align:middle
That means it would get
a lot of likes super fast.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.730 align:middle
I like you.

00:15:38.813 --> 00:15:40.190 align:middle
Oh...!

00:15:40.273 --> 00:15:42.192 align:middle
Let's take a photo
of us three for now.

00:15:42.275 --> 00:15:43.401 align:middle
[SAIKAWA giggles]

00:15:43.485 --> 00:15:45.362 align:middle
[HACHISUKA, KURODA]
Rock, paper, scissors!

00:15:45.445 --> 00:15:46.696 align:middle
[HACHISUKA]
All right!

00:15:46.780 --> 00:15:49.157 align:middle
Ch-o-co-la-te is good! Bam!

00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.658 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Hey! Aren't we
supposed to be

00:15:50.742 --> 00:15:51.868 align:middle
investigating ghosts?

00:15:51.951 --> 00:15:53.495 align:middle
We can take a break, warden!

00:15:53.578 --> 00:15:55.288 align:middle
[KURAMOTO]
I wanna play, too!

00:15:55.372 --> 00:15:56.623 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Ugh! For real?

00:15:56.706 --> 00:15:59.626 align:middle
Cool! Let's start over so
Kuramoto can join in!

00:15:59.709 --> 00:16:01.753 align:middle
Now? I was just about to win.

00:16:01.836 --> 00:16:03.713 align:middle
And the first person to reach
the goal will be leader

00:16:03.797 --> 00:16:04.923 align:middle
of our group.

00:16:05.006 --> 00:16:07.050 align:middle
The leader's orders
will be absolute!

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.302 align:middle
Which means Saikawa's
a servant by default!

00:16:09.386 --> 00:16:11.262 align:middle

You are such a pervert!

00:16:12.806 --> 00:16:14.265 align:middle
Huh? You're so weird.

00:16:14.349 --> 00:16:15.809 align:middle
Let's do this, Kanna!

00:16:15.892 --> 00:16:18.395 align:middle
We're gonna make these
idiot creepers regret today!

Yay.

Looks like Kanna's the winner!

is absolute for all of us!

Mm-hmm!

00:16:32.742 --> 00:16:34.869 align:middle

Come on. We'll make a bet.

Um, it's probably nothing!

Then why don't you
check it out for us?!

[SAIKAWA] What are we gonna
do for the newspaper?

00:19:39.387 --> 00:19:40.764 align:middle
[KURODA] We'll write
a story about how the ghost

in the art room is just
a loose old window.
