WEBVTT

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:09.959
[ILULU giggling]

00:00:10.041 --> 00:00:11.709
[DRAGON 202A]
Ilulu...

00:00:11.792 --> 00:00:13.375
--Ilulu.
--[ILULU] Uh?

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:15.583
[DRAGON 202A] Were you playing
with those humans again?

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:19.417
[ILULU] Mm-hmm! I love humans
very much! They're so nice!

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.709
[DRAGON 202A]
I see. Then perhaps it is time

00:00:21.792 --> 00:00:25.125
we consider coexisting
with these mortal beings.

00:00:25.208 --> 00:00:26.959
--[ILULU] Mm!
--[DRAGON 202B] Bad news!

00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.500
The humans are attacking
the dragon village!

00:00:29.583 --> 00:00:31.208
[DRAGON 202C] This always
happens when we choose

00:00:31.291 --> 00:00:33.041
to stay silent.

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:37.250
[DRAGON 202C]
Damn humans! They will pay!

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.375
[ILULU]
Where's Mommy and Daddy?

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:41.458
[DRAGON 202B]
I'm sorry, my dear.

00:00:41.542 --> 00:00:43.959
[ILULU] Does this mean I can't
play with the humans anymore?

00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:45.542
[DRAGON 202B]
Of course it does!

00:00:45.625 --> 00:00:48.917
Those humans are the ones who
took your parents away from you!

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:52.000
[DRAGON 202C]
They will forever be our enemy!

00:00:52.083 --> 00:00:54.917
We will never come
to an understanding!

00:02:30.458 --> 00:02:33.750
Ah, good. Everyone's asleep.

00:02:35.542 --> 00:02:37.583
[KOBAYASHI] Seeing one of those
up close for the first time

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:40.083
is traumatic enough
without it being mine.

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:41.458
--[door latch clicks]
--Ah!

00:02:43.041 --> 00:02:46.250
Hey, there you are,
Miss Kobayashi. Welcome home!

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:48.542
[giggles] Will you please
let me know next time

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:49.542
you're going to be late?

00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:51.709
Oh. Yeah. I'm sorry.

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:55.041
Your face is flushed and sweaty.
Are you feeling okay?

00:02:55.125 --> 00:02:56.417
Huh?!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.375
[TOHRU] Mm. Maybe you're
catching a cold?

00:02:58.458 --> 00:03:00.583
[KOBAYASHI]
Wah! Don't touch me! I'm fine!

00:03:00.667 --> 00:03:01.959
[TOHRU]
Uh?

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:03.709
[KOBAYASHI] What the hell?!
Why do I start to sweat

00:03:03.792 --> 00:03:05.917
and almost pass out
whenever I look at her?

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.959
Is it lust? Am I lusting now?!

00:03:08.041 --> 00:03:09.750
After Tohru?!

00:03:09.834 --> 00:03:11.709
Go put your clothes on, please!

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.542
[TOHRU]
Okay?

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:16.458
[ILULU chuckles]
Kobayashi...

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:18.709
You can't hide anymore
now that you're a man.

00:03:18.792 --> 00:03:21.417
You'll show everyone
your true colors in no time!

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.500
But I get to see first!
Show me how shallow humans are!

00:03:25.583 --> 00:03:28.041
[KOBAYASHI] That's totally
what this is about.

00:03:28.125 --> 00:03:30.208
I bet Ilulu turned me into
a dude so that I would

00:03:30.291 --> 00:03:33.417
unwittingly display
the worst of humanity.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.583
I just hope it's over soon.

00:03:37.542 --> 00:03:39.917
[KOBAYASHI] Although,
I have no idea what she's trying

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.417
to get out of me.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.083
I definitely need
to keep a clear head.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.750
As a dude. Hmm.

00:03:45.834 --> 00:03:47.417
[alarm ringing]

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.000
[KOBAYASHI groans]

00:03:55.917 --> 00:03:58.291
[KOBAYASHI]
Hey! What are you doing here?!

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:02.041
I'm snuggling. Good morning.

00:04:02.125 --> 00:04:03.333
But why?

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:05.250
I was worried you'd
be cold this morning.

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:08.750
Whoa-kay! I'm warm!
I'm warm and awake!

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:10.417
Time to start the day.

00:04:12.166 --> 00:04:13.375
[KANNA]
Hmm?

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.083
[KOBAYASHI] I have no idea
how this thing works

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.000
or when it might activate.

00:04:18.083 --> 00:04:21.500
Which is why I'll need to keep
my distance from the others.

00:04:21.583 --> 00:04:23.750
I wonder if this is
something Tohru could fix.

00:04:23.834 --> 00:04:26.000
What?! Miss Kobayashi's a man?!

00:04:26.083 --> 00:04:27.542
What are we waiting for?!

00:04:27.625 --> 00:04:30.792
Let's work on
preserving our species!

00:04:30.875 --> 00:04:32.208
[KOBAYASHI]
Maybe I'll wait.

00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.166
[MAN] Okay, it's time to ride
the canoe to adventure!

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.291
[KOBAYASHI]
What are you watching, Kanna?

00:04:35.375 --> 00:04:37.750
[KANNA]
It's called "Clinky Clang."

00:04:39.875 --> 00:04:41.291
[MAN]
Is everybody ready?

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:42.667
--Let's... go!
--[KIDS] Go!

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.291
--[KANNA, TOHRU] Go!
--Uh...

00:04:44.375 --> 00:04:46.750
Now, let's get paddling!

00:04:46.834 --> 00:04:48.875
[KOBAYASHI whimpering]

00:04:48.959 --> 00:04:51.750
Oh no! There's a
waterfall up ahead!

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:52.750
[KIDS laughing]

00:04:52.834 --> 00:04:54.750
[TOHRU squeals, giggles]

00:04:54.834 --> 00:04:56.458
[KOBAYASHI] Total disregard
for personal space

00:04:56.542 --> 00:04:58.083
is normal between
female friends!

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.875
It's what we do!
I can handle it.

00:04:59.959 --> 00:05:03.208
I will not allow this penis
to define my instincts!

00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.500
[TOHRU]
Save me!

00:05:04.583 --> 00:05:06.375
[KOBAYASHI grunts]
Do not hug me for no reason!

00:05:06.458 --> 00:05:07.792
Kobayashi!

00:05:07.875 --> 00:05:09.250
[KOBAYASHI]
Get up! Please get up!

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:10.458
[TOHRU]
Miss Kobayashi!

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:11.709
[KOBAYASHI growls]
What did I tell you

00:05:11.792 --> 00:05:12.959
about random hug attacks?!

00:05:13.041 --> 00:05:13.959
Hi!

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.875
Get out!

00:05:15.959 --> 00:05:17.208
[TOHRU]
Uh...?

00:05:19.709 --> 00:05:22.583
Ugh...

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:25.542
That was so close.
I'd forgotten how clingy she is.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.375
[toilet flushes]

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:29.333
[KOBAYASHI sighs]
Thank goodness...

00:05:29.417 --> 00:05:32.041
It's finally gotten smaller.

00:05:32.125 --> 00:05:34.125
I figured Ilulu's powers
had been weakened during

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.208
her battle with Tohru.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.625
[KOBAYASHI] Trying to remember
the factions from Tohru's world.

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:44.417
Ilulu's from the chaos
faction, too, I think.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.250
They hate humans and
they raise their children

00:05:46.333 --> 00:05:48.250
with the same principles.

00:05:48.333 --> 00:05:52.166
Ilulu grew up that way.
It's the only truth she knows.

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.709
[KOBAYASHI] She can't help
the way she thinks.

00:05:59.375 --> 00:06:01.375
[TOHRU gasps]
Good evening, Miss Kobayashi!

00:06:01.458 --> 00:06:03.959
--Huh?
--Kanna's already asleep.

00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.583
Whaddaya say?
How 'bout a night cap?

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:07.959
[KOBAYASHI chuckles]

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:13.041
Ah! Good stuff.

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:14.583
Yep.

00:06:14.667 --> 00:06:19.375
[KOBAYASHI] That's it. I'm done
overthinking my anatomy today.

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:22.583
[KOBAYASHI grunts] What the--?!
I recognize this feeling...

00:06:22.667 --> 00:06:23.709
The love potion?!

00:06:23.792 --> 00:06:26.417
--[TOHRU chuckles]
--[KOBAYASHI groans]

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:29.041
You thought I wouldn't
notice it, didn't you?

00:06:29.125 --> 00:06:31.208
I know your scent very well.

00:06:31.291 --> 00:06:33.625
--You have boy parts!
--Ah!

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:36.709
This is Ilulu's work, isn't it?

00:06:36.792 --> 00:06:38.959
--Eh?!
--I'm sorry, Miss Kobayashi!

00:06:39.041 --> 00:06:40.917
I'll get you back
to normal soon!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.291
But not just yet.

00:06:42.375 --> 00:06:45.000
I'm not gonna throw
away this opportunity!

00:06:45.083 --> 00:06:46.375
Our hearts have
become intimate--

00:06:46.458 --> 00:06:48.250
Now we can add our bodies!

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:49.709
[giggles]

00:06:49.792 --> 00:06:53.166
Come on, Miss Kobayashi,
I'm ready to receive you now!

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:55.083
Wait, are you
completely turned off?!

00:06:55.166 --> 00:06:57.458
Where's your maid outfit?
You took it off?

00:06:57.542 --> 00:06:58.792
[TOHRU]
Ah?

00:06:58.875 --> 00:07:01.875
Tohru, I'm going to tell you
why maids are great.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:03.625
But with my man brain.

00:07:03.709 --> 00:07:06.250
[TOHRU wails]

00:07:07.792 --> 00:07:09.750
--[toilet flushes]
--[KOBAYASHI] Finally...

00:07:13.792 --> 00:07:15.917
[KOBAYASHI]
Now that that's over...

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.417
What will you try
to do next, Ilulu?

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:29.667
Very good job.
It's displayed nicely, Miss.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.667
[SAIKAWA] Hmm... Something's
still not right about it.

00:07:36.083 --> 00:07:37.125
[SAIKAWA]
There we go!

00:07:37.208 --> 00:07:38.959
So wonderful!

00:07:43.959 --> 00:07:47.667
[ILULU panting]

00:07:51.875 --> 00:07:53.709
Slow down. Stop running.

00:07:53.792 --> 00:07:55.625
[ILULU panting, grunts]

00:07:57.458 --> 00:08:00.083
You followed me here,
you harmony bastard?

00:08:00.166 --> 00:08:03.208
[CREMENE]
I am Cremene. A dragon slayer.

00:08:03.291 --> 00:08:06.667
Please give my name to the judge
in the underworld after you die.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:07.917
I want all the credit.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:09.542
[ILULU gasps]

00:08:11.291 --> 00:08:12.458
Where is she?

00:08:13.834 --> 00:08:15.166
[KOBAYASHI]
Ilulu always seems to appear

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:17.500
when I'm alone after work.

00:08:17.583 --> 00:08:19.625
Maybe she'll show up
if I wait here?

00:08:20.834 --> 00:08:22.917
[KOBAYASHI]
But why would I do that?

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.250
I might be focusing on
Ilulu a little too much.

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:29.417
I wonder if it's because I feel
like we could get along somehow?

00:08:31.333 --> 00:08:32.834
[KOBAYASHI] All the dragons
I've met from other worlds

00:08:32.917 --> 00:08:36.250
have been friendly,
so it makes sense.

00:08:36.333 --> 00:08:39.375
They all have this air of having
survived conflict with humans

00:08:39.458 --> 00:08:41.208
ending in tragic results.

00:08:41.291 --> 00:08:44.000
Yet they remain tolerant
of people in general.

00:08:44.083 --> 00:08:46.458
They understand
we're not all like that.

00:08:46.542 --> 00:08:48.083
They're willing to believe
there is more to us

00:08:48.166 --> 00:08:50.750
than trouble we cause.

00:08:50.834 --> 00:08:53.875
And that's how
I feel about Tohru, too.

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:57.291
Which is why it's important
for her to reconcile with Ilulu.

00:08:57.375 --> 00:08:58.625
Keep the peace.

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:04.166
Of course she's not showing up.

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.208
[KOBAYASHI]
Maybe she went over here

00:09:05.291 --> 00:09:07.125
where there's less foot traffic?

00:09:11.542 --> 00:09:13.625
[KOBAYASHI gasps]

00:09:13.709 --> 00:09:16.000
Ilulu?!

00:09:16.083 --> 00:09:17.667
Are you injured?

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:20.417
[CREMENE]
Hmm. You've seen us, have you?

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.000
Greetings, human of this world,
I've come here to destroy

00:09:24.083 --> 00:09:27.208
that vile beast before you
from the chaos faction.

00:09:27.291 --> 00:09:29.792
You must leave
this place immediately.

00:09:29.875 --> 00:09:33.583
And forget everything you
witnessed here tonight.

00:09:33.667 --> 00:09:35.208
Who is this jerk?

00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:37.542
You came all the way
here to kill Ilulu?

00:09:37.625 --> 00:09:40.000
So you're a grown adult here
trying to kill a child?

00:09:40.083 --> 00:09:41.709
[CREMENE]
I am.

00:09:41.792 --> 00:09:43.834
That creature is pure chaos.

00:09:43.917 --> 00:09:47.166
An evil dragon that will
bring harm to humans.

00:09:47.250 --> 00:09:48.959
Well, if that's
the case, then...

00:09:50.041 --> 00:09:52.083
Uh?

00:09:52.166 --> 00:09:53.375
[shrill alarm blares]

00:09:53.458 --> 00:09:54.500

Hah!

--[shrill blaring continues]
--[grunts]

00:09:55.959 --> 00:09:57.917
That is a most unpleasant sound.

Hey! Keep it down out there!

00:09:59.834 --> 00:10:04.417
[KOBAYASHI] All right!
Security Buzzer Power!

00:10:08.583 --> 00:10:09.625
How much do you weigh?!

00:10:09.709 --> 00:10:11.083
[blaring]

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:15.083
It seems they've escaped.
What's that human thinking?

[ILULU groans softly]

00:10:19.333 --> 00:10:21.208
Hi. Can you see my face?

00:10:21.291 --> 00:10:22.250
[ILULU groans]

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:23.250
[gasps]

00:10:23.333 --> 00:10:24.792
How are you feeling?

00:10:24.875 --> 00:10:28.291
It looks like your wound healed
up freakishly fast at least.

00:10:28.375 --> 00:10:30.375
Why did you save me?

00:10:30.458 --> 00:10:33.208
[KOBAYASHI] Hard to tell
if the coast is clear.

00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:36.083
I bet that creeper's
still after you, huh?

00:10:36.166 --> 00:10:37.417
[ILULU]
I don't know.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.583
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm?

00:10:39.667 --> 00:10:41.041
I shouldn't avoid battles.

00:10:41.125 --> 00:10:43.458
If I die, that means
it was my fate.

00:10:43.542 --> 00:10:45.417
If that's the case,
then me wanting to save you

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:47.166
would also be your fate.

[sighs]

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:52.792
[KOBAYASHI] Hey, Ilulu?
Is there something else

00:10:52.875 --> 00:10:55.792
you want to tell me? You seem
to have this constant 'tude

00:10:55.875 --> 00:10:58.166
and it's making me
a little concerned.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:10:59.458
I told you.

00:10:59.542 --> 00:11:03.000
I can't accept dragons
coexisting with humans.

00:11:03.083 --> 00:11:05.792
It's not possible for them
to ever get along.

00:11:05.875 --> 00:11:08.542
[KOBAYASHI]
Oh yeah, I remember that kinda.

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:12.125
[ILULU] Because if they can
get along, then that means...

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:15.333
That means I wasted so many
years believing the lies!

00:11:17.041 --> 00:11:18.417
[ILULU whimpers]

00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:19.875
[DRAGON 202C]
Dragons are superior,

00:11:19.959 --> 00:11:22.625
so to associate with
humans is shameful.

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:23.959
[ILULU]
I just...

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:25.834
[DRAGON 202D] They caused
all kinds of tragedies.

00:11:25.917 --> 00:11:27.959
Harmony is now impossible.

00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:29.041
[ILULU]
But I...

00:11:29.125 --> 00:11:30.750
[DRAGON 202C]
Humans are our enemy!

00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:33.709
[ILULU]
It's not fair! I just want...

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.000
[ILULU]
...so badly...

00:11:40.542 --> 00:11:41.875
[ILULU]
One more time!

00:11:41.959 --> 00:11:47.375
Please just let me
play with them again...!

00:11:49.458 --> 00:11:50.917
[ILULU]
But they wouldn't let me.

00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:54.583
That girl and that boy
did nothing bad to us and yet...

00:11:54.667 --> 00:11:59.834
[sobbing]

00:11:59.917 --> 00:12:01.792
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm so sorry...

00:12:01.875 --> 00:12:02.792
Then listen...

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:03.834
[ILULU gasps]

00:12:05.458 --> 00:12:08.333
[KOBAYASHI] Why don't we
all play together next time?

00:12:10.875 --> 00:12:13.291
[KOBAYASHI] We do all kinds
of things you might like.

00:12:13.375 --> 00:12:15.083
We play dodgeball,
go to Comiket,

00:12:15.166 --> 00:12:17.500
go to hot springs--
lots of stuff.

00:12:17.583 --> 00:12:19.959
But... you'll have to chill out
on the kind of play

00:12:20.041 --> 00:12:21.542
that turns into battles.

00:12:21.625 --> 00:12:24.542
[ILULU] You...
You're trying to trick me!

00:12:24.625 --> 00:12:26.333
You're saying all these
nice things to me to try

00:12:26.417 --> 00:12:27.792
and win me over!

00:12:27.875 --> 00:12:29.500
[KOBAYASHI]
Yeah, I guess I am.

00:12:29.583 --> 00:12:32.250
You caught me trying to tame
a fierce, evil, chaos dragon

00:12:32.333 --> 00:12:34.041
with kindness and friendship
so that I might

00:12:34.125 --> 00:12:35.375
render her harmless.

00:12:35.458 --> 00:12:36.875
[ILULU]
Huh...?

00:12:36.959 --> 00:12:38.375
[KOBAYASHI] You can still
believe what you've been taught,

00:12:38.458 --> 00:12:40.542
or would you like
to be tricked by me?

--I want--
--[CREMENE] That's enough.

[ILULU, KOBAYASHI gasps]

00:12:55.291 --> 00:12:58.375
I can't believe you and that
human were working together.

00:12:58.458 --> 00:13:00.625
I'll exterminate you both!

00:13:00.709 --> 00:13:03.291
[KOBAYASHI] Can you do that?
Don't you have rules, too?

00:13:03.375 --> 00:13:06.542
[CREMENE] Hah! Those rules
only exist on paper.

00:13:06.625 --> 00:13:08.667
And they only apply to dragons.

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.208
So if you think it's safe
for you to corrupt

00:13:10.291 --> 00:13:12.333

[TOHRU] No, I just erased
his memories of this world

00:14:34.667 --> 00:14:37.000
and then sent him back
from whence he came.

00:14:37.083 --> 00:14:39.166
But not before
I punished him, of course.

00:14:39.250 --> 00:14:41.417
Of course.

Now Ilulu can chill.

[ILULU]
Your tongue is obscenely long!

00:15:07.959 --> 00:15:09.959
[KOBAYASHI] A functional
member of society is someone

00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:13.500
who diligently obeys the rules
and prioritizes their business

00:15:13.583 --> 00:15:16.291
over their private life.

00:15:16.375 --> 00:15:18.834
I always believed
that's how it was.

00:15:20.333 --> 00:15:22.000
[KOBAYASHI] I was taught
that my purpose in life

00:15:22.083 --> 00:15:26.125
is to fill my role as
a functional member of society.

00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:28.291
Then, the next thing I knew,
I no longer had

00:15:28.375 --> 00:15:30.542
any friends in my private life.

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:34.458
[KOBAYASHI] And that's when I
met Tohru and when she managed

00:15:34.542 --> 00:15:37.417
to change me for the better.

00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:42.208
I wonder if maybe I was
seeing my old self in Ilulu.

Everything'll be okay.

00:15:49.959 --> 00:15:53.417
Tohru...? Hey there, Kanna.

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:54.709

We are!

00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:58.542
I brought you back here
and healed your wounds, too!

00:15:58.625 --> 00:16:00.208
[KOBAYASHI]
Where did Ilulu go?

00:16:00.291 --> 00:16:04.000

I tried to send her off, but she
wouldn't leave your side!

I'm glad she finally sees what
we figured out ages ago,

[ANNOUNCER 202A]
Good morning!

00:16:37.875 --> 00:16:41.875
El Niño Miki is here to bring
you today's national weather.

00:16:41.959 --> 00:16:43.917
[KOBAYASHI]
What do we do about that tail?

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:46.041
I guess those claws
don't retract.

00:16:46.125 --> 00:16:48.542
Is it possible to make
her chest more family-friendly?

I mean, come on.

00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:52.041
Believe it or not, Ilulu is
already pushing herself

00:16:52.125 --> 00:16:54.959
to maintain a modest size.
If she wasn't,

00:16:55.041 --> 00:16:57.542
I'm not so sure she'd be able
to fit through the door.

00:16:57.625 --> 00:16:59.834
Oh, I bet she could hide her
claws and tail somewhere

00:16:59.917 --> 00:17:01.083
if she tried.

Wait! Since when can't
she control body parts?!

00:17:03.834 --> 00:17:06.583
All I need is about 5% of that!

00:17:06.667 --> 00:17:08.333
[ILULU]
Kobayashi, Kobayashi.

00:17:08.417 --> 00:17:09.834
Hey, What's up?

00:17:09.917 --> 00:17:12.166
This is where we
eliminate waste, right?

00:17:12.250 --> 00:17:13.291
How does it work?

00:17:13.375 --> 00:17:15.709
Uh. We're doing this?

00:17:15.792 --> 00:17:19.125
Yep. Hop on up there.
And that's basically it.

00:17:19.208 --> 00:17:21.125
[ILULU]
I got it!

00:17:21.208 --> 00:17:23.667
I guess we'll have to
teach her all kinds of things.

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:29.125
If only I had a talented maid
to help me in times like these.

00:17:29.208 --> 00:17:31.709
I'd probably see them
in a whole new light.

00:17:31.792 --> 00:17:33.458
[TOHRU]
Hmm.

00:17:33.542 --> 00:17:34.750
I'm sorry about this.

00:17:34.834 --> 00:17:37.041
I promise it'll just be
while I'm at work.

00:17:37.125 --> 00:17:38.709
Don't be silly! It's fine!

00:17:38.792 --> 00:17:40.166
It's what you do for
someone when you have

00:17:40.250 --> 00:17:42.000
a special eternal
bond with them!

00:17:42.083 --> 00:17:44.000
I'm not feeling ready
to use the word "eternal."

00:17:44.083 --> 00:17:46.041
[TOHRU]
Okay, bye!

00:17:46.125 --> 00:17:47.959
[TV 202B] Have you been
pumping those muscles, fam?

00:17:48.041 --> 00:17:49.625
When you stop working out,
they start to shrink...

00:17:49.709 --> 00:17:50.959
[TOHRU]
It's weird.

00:17:51.041 --> 00:17:52.875
[ILULU groans]

00:17:52.959 --> 00:17:56.166
[TOHRU] We were trying to
kill each other just days ago.

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.959
[ILULU] There's no way Tohru
would ever forgive a traitor.

00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:01.166
I know she's planning
to eliminate me.

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.625
But I want to spend
more time with Kobayashi.

00:18:03.709 --> 00:18:06.458
And I'm not going
down without a fight.

00:18:06.542 --> 00:18:07.667
There's no fighting.

00:18:07.750 --> 00:18:09.458
[BOTH gasp]

00:18:09.542 --> 00:18:11.000
[sigh]

00:18:11.083 --> 00:18:13.333
[TOHRU]
Here. This is the manual I wrote

00:18:13.417 --> 00:18:15.458
about how to live
your life as a human.

00:18:15.542 --> 00:18:18.125
Rule number A:
change your claws into hands.

00:18:18.208 --> 00:18:20.250
[ILULU]
Hmm? Hmm.

00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:26.125
Ah! Ah...

00:18:27.417 --> 00:18:29.083
[chuckles]

00:18:29.166 --> 00:18:31.667
How is it funny to fail at
the one task you were given.

00:18:31.750 --> 00:18:34.208
Do you suck at everything
or just making hands?

00:18:34.291 --> 00:18:37.500
I can't transform them well.
But I can still read.

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:39.750
[TOHRU] At least you can hold
some stuff with those things.

00:18:39.834 --> 00:18:41.625
It's a ball of tiny hands! Look!

00:18:41.709 --> 00:18:43.375
[TOHRU]
Ew! Gross!

00:18:45.333 --> 00:18:48.208
[ILULU] "Greetings. Humans
establish communication

00:18:48.291 --> 00:18:49.750
with greetings.

00:18:49.834 --> 00:18:52.709
For now, just repeat whatever
greeting one says to you."

00:18:54.250 --> 00:18:57.250
"Food. Humans will
mostly eat anything,

00:18:57.333 --> 00:18:59.750
but they stubbornly
won't eat dragon meat.

00:18:59.834 --> 00:19:03.500
Currently seeking ways
to get them to change this."

00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:05.667
"Mating. I want to do it"?

00:19:05.750 --> 00:19:07.166
Everything in here is biased!

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:09.500
It is the whole truth
and nothing but.

00:19:09.583 --> 00:19:11.792
[ILULU] "Clothing. Wearing
clothing similar to what

00:19:11.875 --> 00:19:15.166
other humans wear will
keep you from standing out."

00:19:15.250 --> 00:19:19.333
[ILULU] Hmm? Doesn't look like
you're trying to blend in.

00:19:19.417 --> 00:19:20.333
What?!

00:19:20.417 --> 00:19:21.750
[ILULU]
But whatever you say.

00:19:21.834 --> 00:19:24.458
I can wear human clothes
if we're supposed to.

00:19:24.542 --> 00:19:25.834
We don't have your size here.

00:19:25.917 --> 00:19:26.959
What about Kanna's stuff?

00:19:27.041 --> 00:19:29.041
[TOHRU]
She's even smaller!

00:19:29.125 --> 00:19:31.667
Look, it fits!

00:19:31.750 --> 00:19:34.583
[sighs]
See, what did I tell you?

00:19:34.667 --> 00:19:36.959
Quit making things complicated
and transform your scales

00:19:37.041 --> 00:19:38.041
the way I do!

00:19:38.125 --> 00:19:40.500
I don't have the skills
to do it, okay?

00:19:40.583 --> 00:19:44.083
Sad for you. But I can
lend you something of mine.

00:19:44.166 --> 00:19:46.875
So what do you plan
to contribute here?

00:19:46.959 --> 00:19:48.333
I haven't thought about it.

00:19:48.417 --> 00:19:49.709
Well, what are you good at?

00:19:49.792 --> 00:19:52.000
There has to be
something, right?

00:19:52.083 --> 00:19:54.834
Yeah, I'm sure there is.

00:19:54.917 --> 00:19:56.291
I'm thinking...

00:19:56.375 --> 00:19:57.542
Are you though?

00:19:57.625 --> 00:19:59.250
[ILULU]
Mm-hmm.

00:19:59.333 --> 00:20:01.250
Well, you are welcome
to stay in our home as long

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:03.375
as you would like until
you make a decision.

00:20:03.458 --> 00:20:05.583
[ILULU] Can you say it
without twitching?

00:20:05.667 --> 00:20:07.417
I know this may
come as a surprise to you,

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.375
Mushroom Mitts, but I am
not particularly thrilled

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.000
to have you here
as a house guest!

00:20:11.083 --> 00:20:12.291
[ILULU]
Not surprised at all.

00:20:12.375 --> 00:20:13.542
[TOHRU]
Think about that humiliating

00:20:13.625 --> 00:20:15.000
grand entrance you made!

00:20:15.083 --> 00:20:17.917
We thought you were some
crazy bloodthirsty berserker.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.792
[ILULU] Whatever. I was
bored and fighting you

00:20:19.875 --> 00:20:23.917
seemed like fun. Are you trying
to say that's what I look like?!

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.166
All I know is you
better figure out

00:20:25.250 --> 00:20:26.917
what you want your job to be.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.834
There's a saying that goes,
those who don't work, don't eat.

00:20:29.917 --> 00:20:31.250
What about Kanna?

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:32.291
[TOHRU]
Kanna can't work.

00:20:32.375 --> 00:20:33.917
She's an elementary
school student.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000
Okay, then fine. I'll be an
elementary school student, too!

00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:39.333
You have to be a child
to go to school, dummy.

00:20:39.417 --> 00:20:42.333
And I'm guessing you're about
the same age as me, aren't you?

00:20:42.417 --> 00:20:44.125
Maybe...

00:20:44.208 --> 00:20:45.500
[groans]

00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:47.625
[TOHRU chuckles]

00:20:47.709 --> 00:20:50.458
[TOHRU]
Hurry up and make a choice.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:51.750
[KOBAYASHI]
I'm back!

00:20:51.834 --> 00:20:53.500
[TOHRU]
Welcome home!

00:20:53.583 --> 00:20:55.417
What's going on with Ilulu?

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:58.625
She's thinking about how she
wants to contribute around here.

00:20:58.709 --> 00:21:00.083
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm...

00:21:00.166 --> 00:21:02.458
[ILULU]
Mm. Mm?

00:21:02.542 --> 00:21:04.000
Whatever you choose
will be great.

00:21:04.083 --> 00:21:06.208
[ILULU]
Mm...

00:21:06.291 --> 00:21:07.542
What's wrong?

00:21:07.625 --> 00:21:10.166
I figured out what I want
to do while I'm here.

00:21:10.250 --> 00:21:12.000
Okay, cool! What is it?

00:21:12.083 --> 00:21:13.750
I want to make babies with you.

00:21:13.834 --> 00:21:15.208
--Huh?!
--[gasps]

00:21:15.291 --> 00:21:17.709
You see, I thought about it
and I'm at the perfect age

00:21:17.792 --> 00:21:20.542
to reproduce and raise
healthy children.

00:21:20.625 --> 00:21:22.667
I'm very lonely from not
having a family and I think

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:24.333
you're the one to rescue me.

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:26.625
Kobayashi, I want you
to mate with me!

00:21:26.709 --> 00:21:27.959
You what?!

00:21:28.041 --> 00:21:29.750
I don't know what you're
trying to pull, ma'am,

00:21:29.834 --> 00:21:31.542
but you've crossed
over the line and back!

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:33.083
Also, we're both female.

00:21:33.166 --> 00:21:34.500
I can give your thing back.

00:21:34.583 --> 00:21:36.917
Don't you dare unless
you want her to use it on me!

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:38.583
--[snarls]
--Perverts.

00:21:38.667 --> 00:21:40.417
--Yup.
--[TOHRU] I mean it!

00:21:40.500 --> 00:21:42.125
[KOBAYASHI] I'm not trying
to hold on to my purity,

00:21:42.208 --> 00:21:45.125
but I'm also not trying
to get with dragons.

00:21:49.083 --> 00:21:50.500
[KANNA]
Whoa...

00:21:50.583 --> 00:21:54.041
Surprise! I thought
you might like it.

00:21:54.125 --> 00:21:55.875
[giggles]

00:21:55.959 --> 00:21:57.959
[TOHRU groans]

00:23:30.917 --> 00:23:32.500
[KOBAYASHI] Where are you
going to sleep, Ilulu?

00:23:32.583 --> 00:23:34.291
We don't have space
for another bed.

00:23:34.375 --> 00:23:35.625
[ILULU]
What about in here?

00:23:35.709 --> 00:23:37.625
--[KOBAYASHI] The closet?
--[ILULU] It's calming.

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:39.166
[KOBAYASHI] I mean,
if you're okay with it, sure.

00:23:39.250 --> 00:23:41.166
[ILULU]
Yeah. I like it.

This week on, "Who's Rotten?"

00:23:46.625 --> 00:23:47.583

Cancer!
