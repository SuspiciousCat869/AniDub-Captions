[TOHRU, ELMA snarling]

00:00:11.344 --> 00:00:13.346 align:middle
[sighs]

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.306 align:middle
Do you think you two could
stop snarling at each other

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.641 align:middle
every time you meet?

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.060 align:middle
She's the one who's
always glaring at me! Rude!

00:00:19.144 --> 00:00:21.813 align:middle
Because you need to appreciate
fried tofu fritters!

00:00:21.896 --> 00:00:23.690 align:middle
I suppose if you've been
trying to kill each other

00:00:23.773 --> 00:00:27.110 align:middle
since the moment you met,
then there's nothing I can do.

00:00:27.193 --> 00:00:28.903 align:middle
Huh? No. I wouldn't say

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:31.281 align:middle
we always wanted to
kill each other. Right?

00:00:31.364 --> 00:00:34.492 align:middle
Yeah, I agree.
That part came much later.

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:36.286 align:middle
Okay, enlighten me.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.593 align:middle
[MAN 205A] I heard there
might be a civil war soon.

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:16.845 align:middle
Looks like it.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:18.263 align:middle
[MAN 205A]
The royal succession dispute

00:02:18.346 --> 00:02:20.140 align:middle
is finally coming to a head.

00:02:20.223 --> 00:02:21.808 align:middle
[MAN 205C] At this rate,
the neighboring country's

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.144 align:middle
going to capitalize on it.

00:02:24.227 --> 00:02:26.563 align:middle
Humans are such
foolish creatures.

00:02:26.646 --> 00:02:29.566 align:middle
Every time they open their
mouths, it's about conflict.

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:31.943 align:middle
They don't even try to enjoy
their worthless lives.

00:02:32.027 --> 00:02:33.111 align:middle
[MAN 205D]
Attention, everyone!

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:35.405 align:middle
The priestess of
the holy seas is here!

00:02:35.488 --> 00:02:36.781 align:middle
Wait, the priestess?

00:02:36.865 --> 00:02:39.659 align:middle
What a miracle for her
to finally come to our town!

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:42.996 align:middle
[WOMAN 205C] Thank goodness!
She's come to save us at last!

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:45.457 align:middle
[TOHRU]
The priestess of the holy seas?

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.084 align:middle
She intervenes
in human conflicts

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:51.129 align:middle
and creates
favorable resolutions.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:02:53.506 align:middle
If the conflict is
over water or food,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.259 align:middle
she creates lakes
and abundant harvests.

00:02:56.343 --> 00:02:58.887 align:middle
If humans clash, she uses
her power to make them

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:00.889 align:middle
lose their will to fight.

00:03:00.972 --> 00:03:05.310 align:middle
She must be a god, or a similar
type of entity at least.

00:03:05.393 --> 00:03:07.479 align:middle
Either way, it's against
the rules for such beings

00:03:07.562 --> 00:03:10.148 align:middle
to interfere in human society.

00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:15.445 align:middle
[TOHRU] That must be her.
What's she like?

00:03:15.528 --> 00:03:18.782 align:middle
[CROWD gasping, murmuring]

00:03:24.204 --> 00:03:26.539 align:middle
[TOHRU growls]

00:03:26.623 --> 00:03:28.541 align:middle
[ELMA gasps]

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:29.918 align:middle
[TOHRU]
That woman--!

00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:32.629 align:middle
She's neither a god
nor a divine messenger!

00:03:32.712 --> 00:03:34.089 align:middle
Is she...?

00:03:34.172 --> 00:03:36.383 align:middle
Does she think this is a joke?!

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:43.890 align:middle
[ELMA groans softly]

00:03:43.973 --> 00:03:45.558 align:middle
Hmm?

00:03:45.642 --> 00:03:47.143 align:middle
What are you doing?

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:50.271 align:middle
Honestly, a dragon
turned priestess?

00:03:50.355 --> 00:03:51.606 align:middle
And they believe you?

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.109 align:middle
I could ask you
the very same thing.

00:03:54.192 --> 00:03:57.654 align:middle
Why is the Emperor of Demise's
daughter living amongst humans?

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:02.283 align:middle
If I remember correctly,
you're called Tohru, right?

00:04:02.367 --> 00:04:04.411 align:middle
And if you must know,
I don't believe human beings

00:04:04.494 --> 00:04:06.204 align:middle
should be fighting each other.

00:04:06.287 --> 00:04:09.666 align:middle
It is foolish to sacrifice
unnecessary blood.

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.377 align:middle
I have the power
to stop that, so I do.

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:14.546 align:middle
Are you saying there are
harmony dragons that exist

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.841 align:middle
who will actually do some work?

00:04:17.924 --> 00:04:21.344 align:middle
I bet you've had quite a few
human sacrifices offered up.

00:04:21.428 --> 00:04:24.097 align:middle
It doesn't matter--I don't
need human sacrifices.

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:26.182 align:middle
You don't? Why not?

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.892 align:middle
Who would ever want
to eat a human?

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:30.854 align:middle
I don't believe they're tasty.

00:04:30.937 --> 00:04:32.814 align:middle
I'm willing to bet there are
much more delicious things

00:04:32.897 --> 00:04:34.399 align:middle
in this world.

00:04:34.482 --> 00:04:36.776 align:middle
And it is my belief that humans
will be the ones to create them.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.695 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]

00:04:38.778 --> 00:04:42.198 align:middle
[TOHRU] I see. She's the oddball
Quetzalcoatl mentioned.

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:44.200 align:middle
You must be Elma, then?

00:04:44.284 --> 00:04:47.412 align:middle
Nice! What food do
you usually exchange?

00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:49.998 align:middle
Heh! Are you absolutely
sure you don't belong

00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:51.541 align:middle
to the chaos faction?

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:55.128 align:middle
Speaking of oddballs, you're
not exactly typical either.

00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:58.465 align:middle
I've never met a chaos dragon
who wasn't looking for chaos.

00:04:58.548 --> 00:05:01.509 align:middle
None are ever willing
to engage in conversation.

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:06.681 align:middle
Well, Before I eliminated you, I
wanted to do some investigating.

00:05:06.765 --> 00:05:09.476 align:middle
Investigating? Huh.

00:05:09.559 --> 00:05:11.102 align:middle
Would you care
to join me for a while

00:05:11.186 --> 00:05:12.771 align:middle
and further your education?

00:05:12.854 --> 00:05:14.814 align:middle
Where?

00:05:14.898 --> 00:05:16.816 align:middle
Here in the world of humans.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.194 align:middle
We can investigate together.

00:05:21.738 --> 00:05:24.449 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] So, you two traveled
together for a while, then?

00:05:24.532 --> 00:05:26.951 align:middle
Yeah. I guess.

00:05:27.035 --> 00:05:29.788 align:middle
I put up with her self-righteous
act for too long.

00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:32.665 align:middle
I truly don't know what
I was thinking, Kobayashi.

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:36.086 align:middle
Sounds to me like you were both
just feeling each other out.

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.338 align:middle
Trying way too hard to get along

00:05:38.421 --> 00:05:40.924 align:middle
when you had
very different values.

00:05:41.007 --> 00:05:44.552 align:middle
[TOHRU] Mm... Yeah.
I guess that sounds about right?

00:05:44.636 --> 00:05:47.514 align:middle
I was more interested in getting
to know Elma personally.

00:05:47.597 --> 00:05:49.516 align:middle
She had so much freedom
and always seemed to be

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:52.227 align:middle
doing exactly what she wanted.

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:54.562 align:middle
I know it's been a while, but
that's the way I remember it.

00:05:54.646 --> 00:05:56.648 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Mm-hmm. 'Kay, so then what?

00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.650 align:middle
Oh! Right, sorry.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.735 align:middle
We came to understand
one another, somehow.

00:06:00.819 --> 00:06:02.404 align:middle
We accepted that
we'll never agree,

00:06:02.487 --> 00:06:04.447 align:middle
that's why it made sense...

00:06:04.531 --> 00:06:05.657 align:middle
[BOTH]
...to kill each other.

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.494 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Hmm. That makes no sense at all.

00:06:16.459 --> 00:06:17.836 align:middle
[ELMA]
Why, Tohru?!

00:06:17.919 --> 00:06:20.255 align:middle
What possessed you
to destroy the palace?!

00:06:20.338 --> 00:06:21.715 align:middle
Don't you understand
that was supposed to be

00:06:21.798 --> 00:06:23.717 align:middle
a symbol of peace?!

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.301 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Was it?

00:06:25.385 --> 00:06:28.805 align:middle
The thought of peace requiring
your presence gave me chills.

00:06:28.888 --> 00:06:30.348 align:middle
What?!

00:06:30.432 --> 00:06:33.768 align:middle
[TOHRU] This palace was erected
for you, a place for people

00:06:33.852 --> 00:06:36.312 align:middle
to come and worship
you as a god.

00:06:36.396 --> 00:06:39.482 align:middle
And from this origin, a religion
centered around you took root

00:06:39.566 --> 00:06:43.862 align:middle
and adopted a class-based
society full of inequality.

00:06:43.945 --> 00:06:46.740 align:middle
In time, there would come
to be conflict with those

00:06:46.823 --> 00:06:48.533 align:middle
who refused to accept you.

00:06:48.616 --> 00:06:51.411 align:middle
[ELMA growls]
I would have forbidden that!

00:06:51.494 --> 00:06:52.871 align:middle
[TOHRU]
You're not listening to what

00:06:52.954 --> 00:06:55.081 align:middle
I'm trying to share with you.

00:06:55.165 --> 00:06:57.500 align:middle
Tell me, do you intend to
remain here with these humans

00:06:57.584 --> 00:06:59.336 align:middle
for all eternity?

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:02.213 align:middle
Granting the desires of others
and acting as a symbol

00:07:02.297 --> 00:07:03.965 align:middle
of worship forever?

00:07:04.049 --> 00:07:05.467 align:middle
[ELMA growls]

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.594 align:middle
[TOHRU] I'm dying to know
if you intended to let yourself

00:07:07.677 --> 00:07:09.971 align:middle
get dragged into
the human agenda.

00:07:10.055 --> 00:07:12.474 align:middle
Or did you foolishly believe
you were operating

00:07:12.557 --> 00:07:14.434 align:middle
under your own power?

00:07:14.517 --> 00:07:16.936 align:middle
You diverged from
your plan, Elma!

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:18.980 align:middle
I'm disappointed in you!

00:07:19.064 --> 00:07:21.816 align:middle
I can't stand how
disgraceful you've become.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.110 align:middle
I've no choice but to kill you
and wake those humans

00:07:24.194 --> 00:07:25.653 align:middle
from their dream!

00:07:25.737 --> 00:07:29.199 align:middle
If that's what you want,
then come for me, Tohru!

00:07:29.282 --> 00:07:31.076 align:middle
Take my life!

00:07:31.159 --> 00:07:32.911 align:middle
[roars]

00:07:34.662 --> 00:07:36.164 align:middle
[ELMA]
I knew this was coming.

00:07:36.247 --> 00:07:38.708 align:middle
It was never going
in a good direction!

00:07:38.792 --> 00:07:40.835 align:middle
But what else was I
supposed to do?!

00:07:40.919 --> 00:07:43.254 align:middle
They brought me food
as compensation!

00:07:43.338 --> 00:07:46.466 align:middle
I couldn't resist
and it was delicious!

00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:50.428 align:middle
[roars]

00:07:50.512 --> 00:07:52.514 align:middle
[TOHRU growls]

00:07:52.597 --> 00:07:54.015 align:middle
[ELMA]
She's--!

00:07:54.099 --> 00:07:55.558 align:middle
[roars]

00:07:55.642 --> 00:07:56.643 align:middle
[TOHRU]
She's so--!

00:07:56.726 --> 00:07:58.269 align:middle
[ELMA]
So strong!

00:08:18.832 --> 00:08:19.916 align:middle
[TOHRU]
And that was it.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:22.419 align:middle
That was how we
severed ties conclusively.

00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:25.046 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Hmm.
That sounds simultaneously

00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:26.756 align:middle
grandiose and petty.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:29.426 align:middle
And, in the end, I returned
to the harmony faction's base,

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:30.927 align:middle
and I guess that was that.

00:08:31.011 --> 00:08:33.346 align:middle
I never got involved
with humans again.

00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:35.932 align:middle
So you fight now because
you two get along so well.

00:08:36.016 --> 00:08:37.350 align:middle
[BOTH squeal]

00:08:37.434 --> 00:08:39.728 align:middle
What do you mean?! Did you
not listen to our story?!

00:08:39.811 --> 00:08:40.812 align:middle
No, we don't get along!

00:08:40.895 --> 00:08:42.814 align:middle
We're completely
at odds with each other!

00:08:42.897 --> 00:08:44.190 align:middle
I couldn't tell.

00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:46.651 align:middle
Tohru's been
uncharacteristically chill,

00:08:46.735 --> 00:08:48.737 align:middle
and you always seem to have
your hands too full with work

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.281 align:middle
to try to lead humanity, so...

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.866 align:middle
Wouldn't that mean you
don't really have a reason

00:08:52.949 --> 00:08:54.075 align:middle
to fight in this world?

00:08:54.159 --> 00:08:56.077 align:middle
What?! Ugh...

00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:57.704 align:middle
Come on, Miss Kobayashi...

00:08:57.787 --> 00:09:00.373 align:middle
Do you not understand
why things are like that here?

00:09:00.457 --> 00:09:01.624 align:middle
What?

00:09:01.708 --> 00:09:03.543 align:middle
It's because the food
here is irresistible!

00:09:03.626 --> 00:09:06.421 align:middle
And both Tohru and I have
a gluttonous streak!

00:09:06.504 --> 00:09:07.839 align:middle
I'll never be anything like you!

00:09:07.922 --> 00:09:09.341 align:middle
What do you mean?!

00:09:09.424 --> 00:09:11.343 align:middle
[TOHRU] You're way too easily
enticed by food! I'm not!

00:09:11.426 --> 00:09:13.636 align:middle
Oh, please! Tasting human
culture is the best way

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:15.138 align:middle
to understand humans!

00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.807 align:middle
You'll make up any excuse
to stuff your stupid face!

00:09:17.891 --> 00:09:20.101 align:middle
[ELMA] As if you're not totally
hooked on human food yourself!

00:09:20.185 --> 00:09:21.770 align:middle
Day after day, you're
cooking human recipes!

00:09:21.853 --> 00:09:23.271 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] They've become
so close they understand

00:09:23.355 --> 00:09:25.106 align:middle
each other's thoughts.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.608 align:middle
Then they fight to
shave away the parts

00:09:26.691 --> 00:09:28.193 align:middle
they still can't accept.

00:09:28.276 --> 00:09:30.570 align:middle
[ELMA] Quit trying to compare it
to your unnatural appearance!

00:09:30.653 --> 00:09:31.780 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
I've always wanted to have

00:09:31.863 --> 00:09:33.073 align:middle
friends like that myself.

00:09:33.156 --> 00:09:34.866 align:middle
[ELMA] Do you even know
what natural means?!

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.868 align:middle
[ILULU grunting]

00:10:22.247 --> 00:10:24.624 align:middle
[yawns]

00:10:28.253 --> 00:10:30.213 align:middle
[ILULU]
Whoa!

00:10:30.296 --> 00:10:31.631 align:middle
Whoa...

00:10:31.715 --> 00:10:33.299 align:middle
Whoa-- Ah!

00:10:34.884 --> 00:10:38.096 align:middle
[snoring]

00:10:38.179 --> 00:10:39.639 align:middle
Huh...?

00:10:40.807 --> 00:10:42.517 align:middle
I'm going to kill you, Ilulu.

00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.102 align:middle
Wah!

00:10:44.185 --> 00:10:46.062 align:middle
All you do around here is sleep!

00:10:46.146 --> 00:10:48.106 align:middle
You need to go out there
and get a job!

00:10:48.189 --> 00:10:50.734 align:middle
I promise, I've been
thinking about my future.

00:10:50.817 --> 00:10:51.943 align:middle
One more century.

00:10:52.027 --> 00:10:54.195 align:middle
[TOHRU] You're not on
dragon time anymore!

00:10:54.279 --> 00:10:56.740 align:middle
[ILULU] Mm... Oh, that's
right. I forgot.

00:10:56.823 --> 00:10:58.533 align:middle
I'll help you with
your work for now.

00:10:58.616 --> 00:10:59.826 align:middle
You take that back!

00:10:59.909 --> 00:11:01.745 align:middle
As if you could ever
handle the work of a maid!

00:11:01.828 --> 00:11:04.664 align:middle
Do not underestimate me or I'll
be forced to prove you wrong!

00:11:04.748 --> 00:11:05.999 align:middle
[ILULU] Isn't that what
Kobayashi is always

00:11:06.082 --> 00:11:07.917 align:middle
saying to you?

00:11:08.001 --> 00:11:11.504 align:middle
Wait, this work you speak of...
Does Kobayashi do that?

00:11:11.588 --> 00:11:12.922 align:middle
Yes, she does.

00:11:13.006 --> 00:11:14.841 align:middle
And now, she works harder
so that you can eat, too.

00:11:14.924 --> 00:11:17.344 align:middle
[ILULU sighs]
Then I guess I can work.

00:11:17.427 --> 00:11:19.346 align:middle
I want to work with
Kobayashi's place though.

00:11:19.429 --> 00:11:21.056 align:middle
I'll erase your existence!

00:11:21.139 --> 00:11:22.932 align:middle
You're scaring me! Please! Stop!

00:11:23.016 --> 00:11:24.184 align:middle
And I'll melt Elma!

00:11:24.267 --> 00:11:25.560 align:middle
What does Elma
have to do with this?!

00:11:25.643 --> 00:11:26.895 align:middle
Ah-choo!

00:11:26.978 --> 00:11:29.105 align:middle
[sighs] If you're trying
to preserve your laziness,

00:11:29.189 --> 00:11:30.565 align:middle
there are ways you
can search for a job

00:11:30.648 --> 00:11:32.942 align:middle
without leaving our house.
Use the computer.

00:11:33.026 --> 00:11:36.613 align:middle
No, thanks, I'd rather go out
and test the jobs myself.

00:11:36.696 --> 00:11:38.406 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Hmm.

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:40.075 align:middle
Shall we go look around?

00:11:40.158 --> 00:11:42.243 align:middle
It's my first time
passing through here.

00:11:42.327 --> 00:11:44.871 align:middle
I've flown over the roofs
several times, though.

00:11:44.954 --> 00:11:46.748 align:middle
You're kinda like a cat.

00:11:46.831 --> 00:11:49.668 align:middle
Are you sure you wouldn't be
better off living in the wild?

00:11:49.751 --> 00:11:51.044 align:middle
Oh fine.

00:11:51.127 --> 00:11:53.880 align:middle
I should admit you have been
putting in some effort.

00:11:53.963 --> 00:11:56.383 align:middle
You learned perception blocking,
which is challenging,

00:11:56.466 --> 00:12:00.011 align:middle
and you managed to form proper
hands, which I appreciate.

00:12:00.095 --> 00:12:01.846 align:middle
You've worked very hard.

00:12:01.930 --> 00:12:04.307 align:middle
I kinda like
when you're nice to me.

00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.393 align:middle
I like you.

00:12:06.476 --> 00:12:08.561 align:middle
You shouldn't get so personal.

00:12:08.645 --> 00:12:10.605 align:middle
[ILULU] Fine. I still
like Kobayashi more.

00:12:10.689 --> 00:12:12.732 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Oh, you would. Nothing yet?

00:12:12.816 --> 00:12:15.110 align:middle
I can't believe you haven't seen
anything you'd want to try.

00:12:15.193 --> 00:12:17.946 align:middle
[ILULU]
Hmm. Hmm?

00:12:18.029 --> 00:12:19.781 align:middle
I can't do anything with
meat and fish without

00:12:19.864 --> 00:12:20.865 align:middle
wanting to devour them.

00:12:20.949 --> 00:12:22.575 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Spoken like a true chaos dragon.

00:12:22.659 --> 00:12:24.536 align:middle
[ILULU] Flowers make me
want to trample them.

00:12:24.619 --> 00:12:26.413 align:middle
[TOHRU] It's true--
we were born to destroy.

00:12:26.496 --> 00:12:28.039 align:middle
[ILULU]
Books make me want to burn them.

00:12:28.123 --> 00:12:30.000 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Classic chaos dragon trait!

00:12:30.083 --> 00:12:32.544 align:middle
Unfortunately, all those
things are forbidden.

00:12:32.627 --> 00:12:34.337 align:middle
Yeah, I know.

00:12:34.421 --> 00:12:36.881 align:middle
It's so hard having to ignore
those instincts, though.

00:12:36.965 --> 00:12:38.675 align:middle
On the flip side, we wouldn't
be here if we weren't

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.385 align:middle
able to deny them.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:42.012 align:middle
You know how to do that?

00:12:42.095 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle
Of course I do!

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:46.057 align:middle
But, um, I guess that
means there's nowhere here

00:12:46.141 --> 00:12:48.935 align:middle
--you can work.
--[ILULU] Hey! Let's play!

00:12:49.019 --> 00:12:50.812 align:middle
Okay, let's play!

00:12:50.895 --> 00:12:52.230 align:middle
Do you want to come with us?

00:12:52.313 --> 00:12:53.565 align:middle
Where are you going?

00:12:53.648 --> 00:12:54.733 align:middle
[KANESHIRO]
Shopping!

00:12:54.816 --> 00:12:55.775 align:middle
[ILULU]
Yeah, sure!

00:12:55.859 --> 00:12:57.193 align:middle
[KIRISHIMA]
Let's go this way!

00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.904 align:middle
[BOY 205B]
Yes! Did you see that?

00:12:59.988 --> 00:13:02.282 align:middle
[KANESHIRO] Yoo-hoo!
Hi, Kanna. Hi, Saikawa!

00:13:02.365 --> 00:13:03.533 align:middle
Oh, you're here.

00:13:03.616 --> 00:13:05.785 align:middle
[KANNA]
Hi, Lady Tohru. Hi, Ilulu.

00:13:05.869 --> 00:13:07.954 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Yeah, hi.
What're you guys doing here?

00:13:08.038 --> 00:13:10.373 align:middle
That's what I wanna know. Kanna?

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.084 align:middle
[KANNA] This is just where
we hang out sometimes.

00:13:13.168 --> 00:13:14.836 align:middle
Are these ladies friends
of yours, Kanna?

00:13:14.919 --> 00:13:16.504 align:middle
They seem very pretty and nice.

00:13:16.588 --> 00:13:19.466 align:middle
My name's Tohru. This is Ilulu.

00:13:19.549 --> 00:13:22.761 align:middle
We were searching for a
part-time job for her, but...

00:13:24.387 --> 00:13:26.306 align:middle
[ILULU]
Oh...

00:13:26.389 --> 00:13:27.599 align:middle
[GIRL 205B]
Which one should we get?

00:13:27.682 --> 00:13:29.184 align:middle
[GIRL 205C] Who cares?
They all taste the same.

00:13:29.267 --> 00:13:30.560 align:middle
--[BOY 205C] Oh...
--[BOY 205B] Yes!

00:13:30.643 --> 00:13:32.520 align:middle
[KIRISHIMA] Kanna, this would
look so good on you.

00:13:32.604 --> 00:13:34.439 align:middle
Try this one, Saikawa.

00:13:38.151 --> 00:13:39.611 align:middle
--I have a yellow one.
--Wah!

00:13:39.694 --> 00:13:41.363 align:middle
[shrieks]

00:13:41.446 --> 00:13:43.573 align:middle
[AIDA]
I haven't seen you here before.

00:13:43.656 --> 00:13:45.533 align:middle
Are you the maid's
little sister?

00:13:45.617 --> 00:13:48.661 align:middle
Wow, you have such
an adorable shop, Ms. Aida.

00:13:48.745 --> 00:13:51.414 align:middle
Ilulu, this is Ms. Aida.
Ms Aida, this is Ilulu.

00:13:51.498 --> 00:13:52.540 align:middle
We see each other at

00:13:52.624 --> 00:13:54.626 align:middle
the neighborhood
association meetings.

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:57.337 align:middle
Oh no! What happened
to your poor leg...?

00:13:57.420 --> 00:13:59.673 align:middle
[AIDA] I messed it up
while jogging this morning.

00:13:59.756 --> 00:14:02.342 align:middle
I'm getting old, so I've been
thinking of closing up shop

00:14:02.425 --> 00:14:03.593 align:middle
one of these days.

00:14:03.677 --> 00:14:04.886 align:middle
[GIRLS]
No!

00:14:04.969 --> 00:14:06.262 align:middle
[AIDA]
Hmm.

00:14:06.346 --> 00:14:08.973 align:middle
But as you can see,
I don't think I can.

00:14:09.057 --> 00:14:12.811 align:middle
[ILULU] Hmm... There're
a lot of kids here.

00:14:12.894 --> 00:14:14.646 align:middle
Because we're a dagashi shop.

00:14:14.729 --> 00:14:17.357 align:middle
Many different children have
been coming here for decades now

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:19.067 align:middle
to get their favorite treat.

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:21.277 align:middle
Could I work at
this shop with you?

00:14:21.361 --> 00:14:23.863 align:middle
[AIDA] Hmm? I don't know,
how old are you?

00:14:23.947 --> 00:14:25.865 align:middle
She's the same age as I am.

00:14:25.949 --> 00:14:27.409 align:middle
[AIDA]
The same as you?

00:14:27.492 --> 00:14:30.495 align:middle
Let's see...
I'm not sure what to do.

00:14:30.578 --> 00:14:33.623 align:middle
I was thinking my grandson
would run the shop after me.

00:14:33.707 --> 00:14:36.543 align:middle
But it might be better to have
someone enthusiastic about it

00:14:36.626 --> 00:14:38.336 align:middle
instead of someone reluctant.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.547 align:middle
I would recommend her.

00:14:42.716 --> 00:14:44.467 align:middle
Ah...?

00:14:44.551 --> 00:14:46.011 align:middle
Oh!

00:14:49.055 --> 00:14:50.557 align:middle
[AIDA chuckles]

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.059 align:middle
[laughs]

00:14:53.143 --> 00:14:54.602 align:middle
Okay!

00:14:54.686 --> 00:14:57.605 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] Wow! You're working
part time at a dagashi shop?

00:14:57.689 --> 00:15:01.109 align:middle
It's the Oboro Shop.
Have you heard of it, Kobayashi?

00:15:01.192 --> 00:15:04.029 align:middle
That's the one at the end of
the shopping district, isn't it?

00:15:04.112 --> 00:15:06.114 align:middle
She's forgetting to tell you
that she only got hired

00:15:06.197 --> 00:15:08.491 align:middle
because I lent her
my voice of authority.

00:15:08.575 --> 00:15:10.785 align:middle
[ILULU] It's true. She was firm
when commanding her emotions,

00:15:10.869 --> 00:15:12.245 align:middle
and I thought
she was terrifying..

00:15:12.328 --> 00:15:13.747 align:middle
I need more praise, please.

00:15:13.830 --> 00:15:16.082 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] I don't know that
that was praise.

00:15:19.085 --> 00:15:21.755 align:middle
Will it be okay? The job?

00:15:23.298 --> 00:15:25.216 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
You're worried?

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:28.720 align:middle
You chose it because
you're interested in it, right?

00:15:28.803 --> 00:15:30.305 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm-hmm.

00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.562 align:middle
When I started my job,
I didn't think much about it

00:15:37.645 --> 00:15:39.773 align:middle
until much later either.

00:15:39.856 --> 00:15:41.316 align:middle
Eventually, you'll
discover things you find

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:42.901 align:middle
fulfilling about it.

00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:45.737 align:middle
[ILULU chuckles]

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:48.239 align:middle
--Okay... [chuckels]
--[TOHRU whimpering]

00:15:48.323 --> 00:15:49.824 align:middle
I became a maid because
I was interested in it,

00:15:49.908 --> 00:15:51.743 align:middle
and it's very fulfilling!

00:15:51.826 --> 00:15:53.995 align:middle
So why aren't you petting me?!

00:15:54.079 --> 00:15:56.956 align:middle
Ilulu! Make sure you always
respect the needs of others

00:15:57.040 --> 00:15:59.751 align:middle
and do everything to
the best of your ability.

00:15:59.834 --> 00:16:02.504 align:middle
This "maid" should not be
considered a role model.

00:16:02.587 --> 00:16:04.422 align:middle
--[ILULU] Mm-hmm!
--Rude!

00:16:04.506 --> 00:16:06.508 align:middle
Miss Kobayashi!

00:16:15.058 --> 00:16:16.351 align:middle
[ELMA groans]

00:16:19.521 --> 00:16:20.897 align:middle
[TOHRU growls]

00:16:30.990 --> 00:16:32.450 align:middle
[ELMA sighs softly]

00:16:39.624 --> 00:16:40.917 align:middle
[TAKETO sighs]

00:16:41.001 --> 00:16:43.003 align:middle
[FRIEND 205A]
Hmm? What's wrong, Take?

00:16:43.086 --> 00:16:45.839 align:middle
I feel bad for my grandma,
she hurt her leg.

00:16:45.922 --> 00:16:47.382 align:middle
Are you stuck helping out?

00:16:47.465 --> 00:16:49.384 align:middle
No. Apparently,
she hired someone,

00:16:49.467 --> 00:16:51.928 align:middle
but she wants me to go by
and train them for her.

00:16:52.012 --> 00:16:55.765 align:middle
Wow. I'm impressed she agreed to
hire someone outside the family.

00:16:55.849 --> 00:16:59.019 align:middle
[TAKETO] Yeah, she asked me to
bring a uniform over today.

00:16:59.102 --> 00:17:01.104 align:middle
But check it out. It's huge.

00:17:01.187 --> 00:17:03.398 align:middle
I mean, it looks big enough
to fit an adult man.

00:17:03.481 --> 00:17:05.108 align:middle
So, it bothers you
that she hired a guy?

00:17:05.191 --> 00:17:06.317 align:middle
That's weird.

00:17:06.401 --> 00:17:08.069 align:middle
I don't know where she
could've met this dude.

00:17:08.153 --> 00:17:10.363 align:middle
He better not be
some psychopath!

00:17:10.447 --> 00:17:12.198 align:middle
That's granny's little warrior!

00:17:12.282 --> 00:17:14.242 align:middle
Shut up.

00:17:14.325 --> 00:17:15.577 align:middle
[TAKETO]
This is weird...

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:17.704 align:middle
What the heck are they like?

00:17:17.787 --> 00:17:19.497 align:middle
Good afternoon.

00:17:19.581 --> 00:17:21.166 align:middle
[TAKETO]
That's why it's an adult size!

00:17:21.249 --> 00:17:22.500 align:middle
Crazy!

00:17:24.044 --> 00:17:25.587 align:middle
Are you Aida's grandson?

00:17:25.670 --> 00:17:27.297 align:middle
I'm Taketo, yeah.

00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:29.591 align:middle
[ILULU]
I'm Ilulu. I'm 16.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.884 align:middle
That's what I'm
supposed to say...

00:17:30.967 --> 00:17:32.135 align:middle
The same age?!

00:17:32.218 --> 00:17:35.013 align:middle
Your name...
Are you a transfer student?

00:17:35.096 --> 00:17:36.890 align:middle
How did you meet my grandma?

00:17:36.973 --> 00:17:39.309 align:middle
I met her here when I asked
if I could work with her,

00:17:39.392 --> 00:17:40.560 align:middle
and then she hired me.

00:17:40.643 --> 00:17:43.021 align:middle
[TAKETO]
She didn't even think it over?!

00:17:43.104 --> 00:17:44.773 align:middle
This is suspicious...

00:17:44.856 --> 00:17:46.524 align:middle
She's gotta have some
ulterior motive for wanting

00:17:46.608 --> 00:17:47.859 align:middle
to work here so urgently.

00:17:47.942 --> 00:17:49.652 align:middle
So, how can I help you today?

00:17:49.736 --> 00:17:53.698 align:middle
Oh, right. This is yours.
A uniform and apron.

00:17:53.782 --> 00:17:56.618 align:middle
Things to wear? Fun!

00:17:56.701 --> 00:17:57.994 align:middle
Gah!

00:17:58.078 --> 00:18:00.455 align:middle
Cut it out! What's wrong
with you, you perv?!

00:18:00.538 --> 00:18:02.665 align:middle
[ILULU]
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

00:18:02.749 --> 00:18:04.000 align:middle
You naughty boy.

00:18:04.084 --> 00:18:07.212 align:middle
[gasps] If you're sorry,
keep your shirt on!

00:18:07.295 --> 00:18:08.546 align:middle
Do all changing in the back!

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:11.424 align:middle
Oh. Right, I understand.

00:18:11.508 --> 00:18:12.801 align:middle
[TAKETO]
What the heck was that?

00:18:12.884 --> 00:18:14.928 align:middle
Is she from a country
with that kind of culture?

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:16.012 align:middle
I wanna go there!

00:18:16.096 --> 00:18:17.180 align:middle
[ILULU]
Hey, Taketo?

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:20.100 align:middle
Just Take's fine.
What's the matter?

00:18:20.183 --> 00:18:22.060 align:middle
I can't get the buttons
on top to close.

00:18:22.143 --> 00:18:23.228 align:middle
[TAKETO]
Argh!

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:25.313 align:middle
It's fine! You're fine!
No one'll notice!

00:18:25.397 --> 00:18:27.190 align:middle
Oh. I get it.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:28.274 align:middle
You're a pervert, huh?

00:18:28.358 --> 00:18:29.317 align:middle
[TAKETO squeals]

00:18:29.401 --> 00:18:30.527 align:middle
What'd you call me?!

00:18:30.610 --> 00:18:31.945 align:middle
--You're staring.
--[squeals]

00:18:32.028 --> 00:18:34.781 align:middle
No, I'm not! They're in the way!

00:18:34.864 --> 00:18:36.199 align:middle
I'll be in back.

00:18:36.282 --> 00:18:38.576 align:middle
Lemme know if there's anything
you don't understand.

00:18:41.079 --> 00:18:43.498 align:middle
[TAKETO] She's a whole
new breed of weirdo!

00:18:44.374 --> 00:18:45.750 align:middle
[TAKETO] I'm surprised
Grandma decided to hire

00:18:45.834 --> 00:18:47.419 align:middle
such a bizarre person.

00:18:47.502 --> 00:18:48.670 align:middle
[ILULU]
Hmm!

00:18:48.753 --> 00:18:49.879 align:middle
[TAKETO] She makes
less sense than someone

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.298 align:middle
with ulterior motives,
and it's scary.

00:18:52.382 --> 00:18:54.217 align:middle
Does she even know
what she's doing?

00:18:54.300 --> 00:18:55.301 align:middle
Can I have this, please?

00:18:55.385 --> 00:18:56.428 align:middle
Sure thing.

00:18:56.511 --> 00:18:58.513 align:middle
I want that.

00:18:58.596 --> 00:19:00.432 align:middle
--This one?
--Yeah.

00:19:00.515 --> 00:19:03.101 align:middle
Do we sell these
individually or as a set?

00:19:03.184 --> 00:19:05.186 align:middle
We sell them both ways.

00:19:05.270 --> 00:19:09.149 align:middle
[TAKETO] Man. She's actually
trying to do a good job.

00:19:09.232 --> 00:19:10.734 align:middle
And she does more
than I would've.

00:19:10.817 --> 00:19:12.652 align:middle
I guess that's why Grandma
decided to hire her.

00:19:12.736 --> 00:19:15.530 align:middle
Wow! How come you have
such big watermelons?

00:19:15.613 --> 00:19:17.240 align:middle
[TAKETO]
Harassed on the first day...

00:19:17.323 --> 00:19:18.533 align:middle
How will she handle it?

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.493 align:middle
These are actually
called flame sacs.

00:19:20.577 --> 00:19:22.328 align:middle
They're so strong
they can hold fire.

00:19:22.412 --> 00:19:23.913 align:middle
Whoa! That's cool!

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:25.999 align:middle
[TAKETO] What kind of
deflection was that?!

00:19:26.082 --> 00:19:29.127 align:middle
Do they hurt your back?
Are they heavy?

00:19:29.210 --> 00:19:30.587 align:middle
[ILULU]
Mm...

00:19:30.670 --> 00:19:32.088 align:middle
Would you like to hold them?

00:19:32.172 --> 00:19:33.715 align:middle
Stop! What are you doing?!

00:19:33.798 --> 00:19:35.800 align:middle
Don't be weird-- Ah-- Ah!

00:19:35.884 --> 00:19:37.719 align:middle
--[ILULU] Huh...?
--[TAKETO] Uh...

00:19:41.348 --> 00:19:42.724 align:middle
Poor Take, are you okay?

00:19:42.807 --> 00:19:43.725 align:middle
[gasps]

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:46.144 align:middle
[screams]
I'm sorry!

00:19:46.227 --> 00:19:47.645 align:middle
Uh-huh...

00:19:47.729 --> 00:19:48.855 align:middle
It's okay...

00:19:48.938 --> 00:19:50.273 align:middle
...bad boy.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:52.609 align:middle
What's with
the delayed reactions?!

00:19:53.943 --> 00:19:55.403 align:middle
Bye-bye!

00:19:55.487 --> 00:19:56.738 align:middle
Goodbye!

00:19:56.821 --> 00:19:58.615 align:middle
You two have a good night!

00:20:01.618 --> 00:20:03.078 align:middle
[GIRL 205G giggles]

00:20:04.579 --> 00:20:06.081 align:middle
[ILULU]
Wanna know something?

00:20:06.164 --> 00:20:09.209 align:middle
I like kids.
They're fun to play with.

00:20:09.292 --> 00:20:10.877 align:middle
[TAKETO]
Hmm?

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:13.630 align:middle
But I'm not allowed to play
with them while I'm working.

00:20:13.713 --> 00:20:15.632 align:middle
I thought if I worked somewhere
where there were children,

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.676 align:middle
it would be more fun.

00:20:20.679 --> 00:20:24.933 align:middle
[sighs] It's time for us to
close up shop for the night.

00:20:25.016 --> 00:20:25.975 align:middle
[ILULU]
Hmm?

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.435 align:middle
Maybe we could play together.

00:20:27.519 --> 00:20:29.104 align:middle
I'll show you how to spin
a top if you want.

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:30.146 align:middle
It's actually pretty easy.

00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.565 align:middle
Oh, yeah! That!
I'm dying to learn! 

00:20:32.649 --> 00:20:34.192 align:middle
I'll go get it!

00:20:34.275 --> 00:20:35.610 align:middle
[TAKETO]
She's a nice girl.

00:20:35.694 --> 00:20:38.405 align:middle
Looks like I won't have
to worry about Grandma.

00:20:39.698 --> 00:20:41.574 align:middle
Hey, Take, I think I like you.

00:20:41.658 --> 00:20:42.992 align:middle
[TAKETO] Girls aren't
supposed to say that!

00:20:43.076 --> 00:20:45.161 align:middle
[ILULU]
After Kobayashi.

00:20:45.245 --> 00:20:48.456 align:middle
And who's that? Koba-what?

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:50.458 align:middle
Here it is.

00:20:50.542 --> 00:20:52.585 align:middle
--Watch closely.
--[gasps]

00:20:58.425 --> 00:20:59.801 align:middle
[ELMA] Wanna hear
something interesting?

00:20:59.884 --> 00:21:02.303 align:middle
Apparently, humans
make wishes on stars.

00:21:02.387 --> 00:21:03.388 align:middle
Did you know that?

00:21:03.471 --> 00:21:04.639 align:middle
Huh?

00:21:04.723 --> 00:21:07.642 align:middle
They pray to the stars
for peace and happiness.

00:21:07.726 --> 00:21:10.061 align:middle
Or bountiful harvests,
or health for themselves,

00:21:10.145 --> 00:21:12.480 align:middle
their friends, and families.

00:21:12.564 --> 00:21:15.233 align:middle
Sounds like they don't care
who grants their wishes,

00:21:15.316 --> 00:21:17.068 align:middle
as long as they're fulfilled.

00:21:17.152 --> 00:21:20.363 align:middle
What an utterly
inferior species.

00:21:20.447 --> 00:21:22.365 align:middle
And what would you
wish for, Tohru?

00:21:22.449 --> 00:21:25.118 align:middle
If your wish was
guaranteed to come true.

00:21:25.201 --> 00:21:26.453 align:middle
Hmm.

00:21:28.955 --> 00:21:31.166 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Nothing, really.

00:21:33.043 --> 00:21:33.960 align:middle
I'd make a wish.

00:21:34.044 --> 00:21:35.378 align:middle
Oh, I'm sure you would!

00:21:35.462 --> 00:21:37.797 align:middle
All the yummy sweets
in the world! That right?

00:21:38.965 --> 00:21:41.593 align:middle
You do know me quite well.

00:21:41.676 --> 00:21:44.054 align:middle
You're close.
But no, that's not it.

00:21:44.137 --> 00:21:45.221 align:middle
What then?

00:21:45.305 --> 00:21:46.931 align:middle
I'm gonna have all
the delicious food,

00:21:47.015 --> 00:21:48.975 align:middle
and then I'm gonna
have your share, too.

00:21:49.059 --> 00:21:50.518 align:middle
Ah...

00:21:54.022 --> 00:21:55.857 align:middle
[TOHRU]
As you wish.

00:23:27.907 --> 00:23:29.576 align:middle
[ELMA] Our lunch break
is way too short!

00:23:29.659 --> 00:23:31.828 align:middle
Don't you agree,
Miss Kobayashi?!

00:23:31.911 --> 00:23:33.204 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Not really. No.

00:23:33.288 --> 00:23:34.748 align:middle
[ELMA] There are five places
on my current list that

00:23:34.831 --> 00:23:37.208 align:middle
I really want to try for lunch,
but I only have enough time

00:23:37.292 --> 00:23:38.376 align:middle
to hit two of them!

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.336 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Most people only go to one.

00:23:39.419 --> 00:23:41.171 align:middle
[ELMA]
I'm hungry, okay?!

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:45.592 align:middle
