00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:14.389 align:middle
[SHOUTA screams]

00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:18.309 align:middle
What do you think you're doing?!

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:19.769 align:middle
[LUCOA] You looked cold,
so I thought I'd be

00:00:19.853 --> 00:00:23.023 align:middle
an extra blanket for you.
Since I'm your familiar.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.025 align:middle
[SHOUTA growls]
No, thanks!

00:00:25.108 --> 00:00:27.777 align:middle
[growls, sighs]

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:30.280 align:middle
It's been like this
ever since she came here.

00:00:30.363 --> 00:00:32.490 align:middle
She's always glued
to me at home.

00:00:32.574 --> 00:00:35.160 align:middle
Gimme some space
to be a man, gah!

00:00:37.328 --> 00:00:38.246 align:middle
Right!

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.165 align:middle
I have to...

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:41.958 align:middle
...take back control!

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:44.878 align:middle
I'll teach her who's boss
once and for all!

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:22.600 align:middle
[sighs]

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:26.104 align:middle
[LUCOA grunts]

00:02:26.187 --> 00:02:28.440 align:middle
[SHOUTA] The first step is
to uncover her weakness.

00:02:28.523 --> 00:02:30.233 align:middle
Now, then. Ooh--

00:02:30.316 --> 00:02:31.818 align:middle
[squeals]

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:33.820 align:middle
[LUCOA sighs]
There's really no point in

00:02:33.903 --> 00:02:36.156 align:middle
wearing clothes inside, ya know?

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.533 align:middle
What the heck is wrong with her?

00:02:38.616 --> 00:02:42.746 align:middle
[sighs] I'm so much more
comfortable without anything on.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.832 align:middle
I suppose some might
call that a shortcoming.

00:02:45.915 --> 00:02:47.625 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Lucoa, Lucoa!

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.128 align:middle
What is it, Shouta-baby?

00:02:50.211 --> 00:02:51.171 align:middle
This is for you!

00:02:51.254 --> 00:02:52.839 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Huh?

00:02:52.922 --> 00:02:55.967 align:middle
Your master commands it!
Put some clothes on!

00:02:56.051 --> 00:02:59.012 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
So awkward. Is it over yet?

00:02:59.095 --> 00:03:01.056 align:middle
I put it on for you!

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.477 align:middle
Thank you so much
for the thoughtful present!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.104 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Crap! It didn't work...

00:03:08.188 --> 00:03:11.024 align:middle
Wonder how she'll respond
to a little bitterness?

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:13.068 align:middle
You're so sweet!

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.906 align:middle
[SHOUTA] Guess I'm the only one
who thinks it's gross!

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.199 align:middle
[LUCOA humming]

00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:21.284 align:middle
[SHOUTA] What about
our neighbor's scary dog?

00:03:21.368 --> 00:03:22.494 align:middle
[barking]

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:24.079 align:middle
--[SHOUTA squeals]
--[laughs]

00:03:24.162 --> 00:03:27.415 align:middle
[SHOUTA] How am I the only one
who finds that thing terrifying?

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.835 align:middle
[SHOUTA] If I want to be
the greatest mage one day.

00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:33.838 align:middle
I have to have ultimate
control over my familiar.

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:34.923 align:middle
[TOHRU gasps]

00:03:35.006 --> 00:03:36.966 align:middle
I'm sorry! Huh...?

00:03:38.677 --> 00:03:40.470 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI] You wanna
know Lucoa's weaknesses?

00:03:40.553 --> 00:03:41.846 align:middle
Yeah.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.598 align:middle
[TOHRU] Oh, I know!
I've got something good.

00:03:43.682 --> 00:03:44.599 align:middle
Tell me, tell me!

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:46.559 align:middle
Those flesh orbs slow her down.

00:03:46.643 --> 00:03:49.020 align:middle
It's way too hard to dodge
attacks with those things!

00:03:49.104 --> 00:03:50.689 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
I don't mean combat weaknesses!

00:03:50.772 --> 00:03:53.983 align:middle
[TOHRU] Mm... Okay then,
I'd say it's liquor.

00:03:54.067 --> 00:03:55.151 align:middle
Liquor...?

00:03:55.235 --> 00:03:56.695 align:middle
I thought she prided
herself on how well

00:03:56.778 --> 00:03:58.321 align:middle
she could hold her liquor?

00:03:58.405 --> 00:04:01.032 align:middle
Well, of course she can,
but that's not what I mean.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:03.034 align:middle
I'm saying she won't
resist any alcohol

00:04:03.118 --> 00:04:04.619 align:middle
that's put in front of her.

00:04:04.703 --> 00:04:06.496 align:middle
She's usually overly
cautious about everything

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:08.832 align:middle
except when it comes
to throwin' em back.

00:04:08.915 --> 00:04:11.292 align:middle
You could poison a drink
and she'd chug it down!

00:04:11.376 --> 00:04:13.003 align:middle
I'm not trying to kill her!

00:04:13.086 --> 00:04:15.130 align:middle
You're asking about weaknesses,

00:04:15.213 --> 00:04:16.881 align:middle
but from any
dragon's perspective,

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:19.050 align:middle
humans are nothing
but weaknesses.

00:04:19.134 --> 00:04:20.802 align:middle
Even if you managed
to find something,

00:04:20.885 --> 00:04:23.930 align:middle
do you really think it would be
enough to keep Lucoa at bay?

00:04:24.014 --> 00:04:26.933 align:middle
I thought the two of you
were doing well?

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:29.561 align:middle
No, we're not. I'm not.

00:04:29.644 --> 00:04:32.856 align:middle
Lucoa's always wandering around
somewhere without telling me.

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:36.192 align:middle
If she's here she's teasing me,
or making fun of me.

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.445 align:middle
She just doesn't
respect me at all.

00:04:38.528 --> 00:04:40.363 align:middle
I want to find some kind
of weakness of hers

00:04:40.447 --> 00:04:43.241 align:middle
so she'll remember
I'm the one in charge.

00:04:43.324 --> 00:04:46.411 align:middle
I'm pretty sure she knows that
already in her own way.

00:04:46.494 --> 00:04:47.829 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Uh...

00:04:47.912 --> 00:04:49.080 align:middle
[TOHRU] Lucoa's one of
those dragons that can't stay

00:04:49.164 --> 00:04:51.499 align:middle
in one place for very long.

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:54.294 align:middle
If she's still with you,
it's because she likes you.

00:04:54.377 --> 00:04:55.503 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Shouta, sweetie?

00:04:55.587 --> 00:04:56.629 align:middle
Ah! Mm!

00:04:56.713 --> 00:04:57.630 align:middle
[LUCOA]
There you are!

00:04:57.714 --> 00:04:59.507 align:middle
Ho--How long
have you been here?!

00:04:59.591 --> 00:05:01.801 align:middle
Actually, I just arrived.

00:05:01.885 --> 00:05:05.764 align:middle
[sighs]
Um. I wanna go home.

00:05:07.474 --> 00:05:09.267 align:middle
Wait! I'll escort you!

00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:10.727 align:middle
See you later.

00:05:17.525 --> 00:05:18.818 align:middle
[LUCOA]
Ya know, kid.

00:05:18.902 --> 00:05:21.529 align:middle
I would've told you my weakness
if you had just asked.

00:05:21.613 --> 00:05:22.781 align:middle
Huh?

00:05:22.864 --> 00:05:25.283 align:middle
The thought that truly
terrifies me the most

00:05:25.367 --> 00:05:28.078 align:middle
is having my home taken away.

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.789 align:middle
I once made a huge
mistake, you know.

00:05:30.872 --> 00:05:33.249 align:middle
And I was driven
out of my homeland.

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:34.918 align:middle
It really broke me down.

00:05:35.001 --> 00:05:38.755 align:middle
Ever since then, I've been
afraid of settling in one place.

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:40.173 align:middle
[SHOUTA gasps]

00:05:40.256 --> 00:05:42.634 align:middle
One day, a friend who I thought
would never have a home

00:05:42.717 --> 00:05:45.303 align:middle
found one for herself somehow.

00:05:45.387 --> 00:05:48.014 align:middle
I admit,
it made me kind of jealous.

00:05:48.098 --> 00:05:50.016 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
And that's why you came to me?

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.102 align:middle
But, why me?

00:05:52.185 --> 00:05:54.437 align:middle
[LUCOA] Because you're
the one who invited me in.

00:05:54.521 --> 00:05:56.690 align:middle
You're the first one
to ask me to stay.

00:05:56.773 --> 00:05:59.693 align:middle
I can't tell you how happy
it made me to hear that.

00:05:59.776 --> 00:06:03.863 align:middle
[SHOUTA] Yeah, but,
I asked you as a familiar.

00:06:03.947 --> 00:06:06.574 align:middle
Honestly, I know
I'm not a good match.

00:06:06.658 --> 00:06:08.785 align:middle
You're incredible
at what you do.

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:11.621 align:middle
and I'm not nearly
experienced enough yet.

00:06:11.705 --> 00:06:13.915 align:middle
[LUCOA]
That's true.

00:06:13.998 --> 00:06:15.875 align:middle
I'm a phenomenal familiar,

00:06:15.959 --> 00:06:18.503 align:middle
which is why I could read
you at first glance.

00:06:19.587 --> 00:06:23.008 align:middle
[LUCOA] You're a good boy with
a kind heart who works hard.

00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:25.969 align:middle
Even to the point of
overextending yourself.

00:06:26.052 --> 00:06:28.763 align:middle
Seeing that was
good enough for me.

00:06:28.847 --> 00:06:29.848 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Thank you.

00:06:29.931 --> 00:06:33.643 align:middle
[LUCOA giggles]
Such a cutie.

00:06:34.561 --> 00:06:36.229 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Whatever. I really wish

00:06:36.312 --> 00:06:39.149 align:middle
she'd stop treating me
like a helpless infant.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:44.404 align:middle
All yours, Shouta!

00:06:44.487 --> 00:06:47.657 align:middle
Let me know whenever
you want it, okay?

00:06:47.741 --> 00:06:50.535 align:middle
Ah! What do you mean by that?

00:06:51.536 --> 00:06:53.288 align:middle
[sighs]

00:06:53.371 --> 00:06:56.916 align:middle
Wow, what's wrong? That was
quite the dramatic sigh.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.003 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Well, my parents
are coming to visit me.

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.839 align:middle
Oh. What are you
gonna do about Fafnir?

00:07:02.922 --> 00:07:05.258 align:middle
[TAKIYA groans] I asked if
he'd like to go adventuring

00:07:05.342 --> 00:07:08.720 align:middle
in the mountains or something
while they're here, but...

00:07:08.803 --> 00:07:10.597 align:middle
I absolutely refuse!

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:12.766 align:middle
Apparently, there's a brand new
hardcore video game

00:07:12.849 --> 00:07:15.018 align:middle
releasing at
the same time. So...

00:07:15.101 --> 00:07:17.354 align:middle
I guess you'll just
have to introduce them.

00:07:17.437 --> 00:07:20.190 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Right... Both of my
parents are pretty forward,

00:07:20.273 --> 00:07:22.942 align:middle
so the thought of them upsetting
Fafnir and watching my treasures

00:07:23.026 --> 00:07:25.445 align:middle
get half-destroyed is just...
[whimpers]

00:07:25.528 --> 00:07:28.490 align:middle
You're worried about
your weeb collection?!

00:07:28.573 --> 00:07:29.616 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
I refuse.

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:31.743 align:middle
I can't afford
to move from this spot.

00:07:31.826 --> 00:07:34.037 align:middle
Not until I've
gathered all trophies.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.706 align:middle
You're pretty invested.

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.917 align:middle
I mean, you've already
beaten the game.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.544 align:middle
Why not reward yourself
with a little time off?

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:45.590 align:middle
Dragons can fight off their
enemies for thousands of years.

00:07:45.674 --> 00:07:47.509 align:middle
You don't need
to worry about me.

00:07:48.843 --> 00:07:50.845 align:middle
Grr. Another bust.

00:07:50.929 --> 00:07:54.849 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Well, that's that.
What do I do now?

00:07:54.933 --> 00:07:55.975 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Hmm.

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:57.644 align:middle
[phone ringing]

00:07:57.727 --> 00:08:00.146 align:middle
Hang on!

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:04.192 align:middle
Really? You're having trouble
getting Fafnir to listen to you?

00:08:04.275 --> 00:08:05.819 align:middle
Yeah, I figured you
might have some pointers

00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:07.987 align:middle
since you've known
him the longest.

00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:10.115 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Perhaps. I suppose I do owe you

00:08:10.198 --> 00:08:13.159 align:middle
for planning that
hot springs trip for us.

00:08:13.243 --> 00:08:16.371 align:middle
Thank you, Tohru. So what
would you suggest that I try?

00:08:16.454 --> 00:08:17.622 align:middle
Use brute force!

00:08:17.706 --> 00:08:19.958 align:middle
Give him no choice
but to obey your commands!

00:08:20.041 --> 00:08:21.668 align:middle
Force is your only way in!

00:08:21.751 --> 00:08:24.379 align:middle
With Fafnir? Use force?!

00:08:24.462 --> 00:08:27.215 align:middle
You know that's
impossible, right...?

00:08:27.298 --> 00:08:28.591 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Not really.

00:08:28.675 --> 00:08:31.594 align:middle
It's the only method
I've ever used with him.

00:08:31.678 --> 00:08:34.431 align:middle
When we first met, he attacked
me for trying to sleep

00:08:34.514 --> 00:08:37.100 align:middle
in his cavern and we battled.

00:08:40.603 --> 00:08:41.604 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Not bad.

00:08:41.688 --> 00:08:43.106 align:middle
[TOHRU]
You're quite skilled as well.

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:45.025 align:middle
[TOHRU] Once we recognized
each other's strength,

00:08:45.108 --> 00:08:48.361 align:middle
he finally decided to share
space in his big cave with me.

00:08:48.445 --> 00:08:51.114 align:middle
[TAKIYA] Wow. Pretty intense
for a first meeting.

00:08:51.197 --> 00:08:53.783 align:middle
I realize that method might be
a bit much for a human

00:08:53.867 --> 00:08:56.036 align:middle
to take on right away.
Maybe ask Lucoa?

00:08:56.119 --> 00:08:57.454 align:middle
Ahh.

00:08:57.537 --> 00:08:59.706 align:middle
You really think she can help?
Okay, what's her number?

00:08:59.789 --> 00:09:01.291 align:middle
[TOHRU]
Kanna! Knock it off!

00:09:01.374 --> 00:09:04.878 align:middle
--[receiver clicks]
--And... she hung up on me.

00:09:04.961 --> 00:09:07.922 align:middle
Who do I know who knows Lucoa?

00:09:08.006 --> 00:09:09.257 align:middle
Oh.

00:09:09.341 --> 00:09:10.967 align:middle
I added Shouta to
my friends list the last time

00:09:11.051 --> 00:09:12.844 align:middle
we played games together.

00:09:15.513 --> 00:09:17.891 align:middle
What? You're here for Lucoa?

00:09:17.974 --> 00:09:20.018 align:middle
She said she was
going abroad for fun.

00:09:20.101 --> 00:09:21.311 align:middle
She's not around.

00:09:21.394 --> 00:09:22.937 align:middle
Dang it...

00:09:23.021 --> 00:09:24.856 align:middle
Wait, do you need
help with something?

00:09:24.939 --> 00:09:27.359 align:middle
If so, I'd be happy
to assist if I can!

00:09:27.442 --> 00:09:28.360 align:middle
You mean that?

00:09:28.443 --> 00:09:29.569 align:middle
Yep!

00:09:29.652 --> 00:09:31.279 align:middle
I'm constantly working
to improve my skills

00:09:31.363 --> 00:09:33.490 align:middle
as a mage every single day.

00:09:33.573 --> 00:09:36.493 align:middle
Helping others would serve
as a part of my training.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:39.704 align:middle
Oh, wow, you're a very
responsible young lad.

00:09:39.788 --> 00:09:41.414 align:middle
Here's the sitch...

00:09:41.498 --> 00:09:42.749 align:middle
That's impossible!

00:09:42.832 --> 00:09:45.460 align:middle
You're, uh, talking about
that scary dragon...?

00:09:45.543 --> 00:09:48.129 align:middle
Yeah, I guess that's what he is.

00:09:48.213 --> 00:09:50.590 align:middle
[sighs] I'm thinking it might
be easier to do something

00:09:50.674 --> 00:09:52.509 align:middle
about my parents than Faf-kun.

00:09:52.592 --> 00:09:54.427 align:middle
Huh? Who's Faf-kun?

00:09:54.511 --> 00:09:57.472 align:middle
The dragon?
I thought his name was Fafnir?

00:09:57.555 --> 00:09:59.599 align:middle
Is Faf-kun his nickname
or something?

00:09:59.683 --> 00:10:02.977 align:middle
What? Mm. Yeah, it is.

00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:06.356 align:middle
He's accepted that nickname
as a special gift from you?

00:10:06.439 --> 00:10:09.567 align:middle
[TAKIYA] I don't know about
that, but he's fine with it.

00:10:09.651 --> 00:10:11.528 align:middle
Then you can form a pact.

00:10:11.611 --> 00:10:12.737 align:middle
What do you mean?

00:10:12.821 --> 00:10:14.364 align:middle
[SHOUTA] If you've given
him a special name,

00:10:14.447 --> 00:10:17.200 align:middle
and he's accepted it, then the
preparations to form a pact

00:10:17.283 --> 00:10:18.952 align:middle
are nearly complete.

00:10:21.538 --> 00:10:22.706 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Take this.

00:10:22.789 --> 00:10:24.082 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
What is it?

00:10:24.165 --> 00:10:25.834 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
An orb of magic power.

00:10:25.917 --> 00:10:28.586 align:middle
I've poured my own
magical powers into it.

00:10:28.670 --> 00:10:30.046 align:middle
That should be enough
for someone who doesn't

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.298 align:middle
have abilities to use it.

00:10:32.382 --> 00:10:34.300 align:middle
You should at least be able
to activate the ritual

00:10:34.384 --> 00:10:35.969 align:middle
to forge a pact.

00:10:36.052 --> 00:10:39.431 align:middle
Really? You're
incredible, Shouta.

00:10:39.514 --> 00:10:41.641 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Well, um, maybe not.

00:10:41.725 --> 00:10:44.561 align:middle
Would it be okay to ask you
for a favor in return?

00:10:44.644 --> 00:10:46.896 align:middle
Oh, sure. Like some life force?

00:10:46.980 --> 00:10:50.150 align:middle
Only devils ask for that.

00:10:50.233 --> 00:10:52.861 align:middle
I was hoping I could convince
you to exchange a lesson or two

00:10:52.944 --> 00:10:56.281 align:middle
for my services.
I wanna be a cool adult, too!

00:10:56.364 --> 00:10:59.409 align:middle
What? That's a pretty
ambitious request kid.

00:10:59.492 --> 00:11:01.036 align:middle
I'm not right for the job.

00:11:01.119 --> 00:11:03.455 align:middle
I don't know anything
about being cool.

00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:05.373 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
So it's a promise, then!

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:10.754 align:middle
[sighs]
We're making a pact. Huh.

00:11:11.796 --> 00:11:13.256 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
I'm home.

00:11:17.302 --> 00:11:19.220 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
A master-servant pact.

00:11:19.304 --> 00:11:20.680 align:middle
Wow.

00:11:20.764 --> 00:11:22.515 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Hmph.

00:11:22.599 --> 00:11:23.516 align:middle
Faf-kun.

00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.642 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
Hmm?

00:11:24.726 --> 00:11:26.061 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
This is for you.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:32.192 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
What? An orb of magic power?

00:11:32.275 --> 00:11:34.069 align:middle
You think this'll do the trick?

00:11:36.780 --> 00:11:38.365 align:middle
I'm still not leaving.

00:11:38.448 --> 00:11:40.950 align:middle
Fine. It's a bust, then.

00:11:41.034 --> 00:11:42.911 align:middle
Riddle me this, Faf-kun.

00:11:42.994 --> 00:11:44.913 align:middle
How is it that someone
as prideful as you

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.791 align:middle
was able to accept
a nickname from me?

00:11:47.874 --> 00:11:51.086 align:middle
I had no idea you were
taking a risk with that.

00:11:51.169 --> 00:11:53.505 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
I see.

00:11:53.588 --> 00:11:56.132 align:middle
Hmph. I suggest you be
grateful to whichever brat

00:11:56.216 --> 00:11:58.218 align:middle
gave you that measly orb.

00:11:58.301 --> 00:12:00.470 align:middle
He gave it to me in exchange
for some advice on being

00:12:00.553 --> 00:12:02.097 align:middle
a suave adult.

00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:05.016 align:middle
An adult? Huh.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.144 align:middle
What do you think the term
"adult" means to a dragon?

00:12:08.228 --> 00:12:09.688 align:middle
Um.

00:12:09.771 --> 00:12:11.773 align:middle
Well, it means they've matured
out of their immature state?

00:12:11.856 --> 00:12:13.149 align:middle
It does not.

00:12:13.233 --> 00:12:16.444 align:middle
That only refers to the
physical state of the body.

00:12:16.528 --> 00:12:20.573 align:middle
There is no concept of adult
or child in a dragon's mind.

00:12:20.657 --> 00:12:25.412 align:middle
We can only track our growth
in life by strength.

00:12:25.495 --> 00:12:28.456 align:middle
Our state of mind
is dependent upon that.

00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:30.959 align:middle
Parents don't protect
their offspring.

00:12:31.042 --> 00:12:33.545 align:middle
Dragons never used terms
like "adult" or "child"

00:12:33.628 --> 00:12:37.173 align:middle
until more and more of us
started interacting with humans.

00:12:37.257 --> 00:12:39.884 align:middle
Do you understand, Takiya?

00:12:39.968 --> 00:12:43.680 align:middle
It means dragons are living
their lives like humans.

00:12:43.763 --> 00:12:47.642 align:middle
They know such values will lead
to nothing but foolishness,

00:12:47.726 --> 00:12:50.145 align:middle
but abide by them anyway.

00:12:50.228 --> 00:12:52.564 align:middle
The dragons here act the same.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:57.986 align:middle
We're all masquerading
as humans.

00:12:58.069 --> 00:13:00.613 align:middle
Okay, I can tell you
don't really believe that.

00:13:00.697 --> 00:13:02.490 align:middle
I hear it in your voice.

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:05.618 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
I do.

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:09.622 align:middle
[FAFNIR] Tohru has firmly
declared she will never regret

00:13:09.706 --> 00:13:12.250 align:middle
her reckless decisions.

00:13:12.334 --> 00:13:16.463 align:middle
And that human, Kobayashi, drove
away the Emperor of Demise.

00:13:16.546 --> 00:13:18.673 align:middle
I grew curious as to why
they would go so far

00:13:18.757 --> 00:13:20.508 align:middle
to keep up the act.

00:13:20.592 --> 00:13:22.969 align:middle
So, I decided to try playing
the human game myself

00:13:23.053 --> 00:13:25.096 align:middle
to learn a bit more.

00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.308 align:middle
That's the only reason
I let you give me a nickname.

00:13:30.477 --> 00:13:32.937 align:middle
[FAFNIR]
At long last, it dropped!

00:13:33.021 --> 00:13:34.105 align:middle
[laughs]

00:13:34.189 --> 00:13:35.815 align:middle
This is fantastic news!

00:13:35.899 --> 00:13:38.151 align:middle
[grunts]
Takiya!

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.320 align:middle
I'm in a good mood now,
so if you can defeat me,

00:13:40.403 --> 00:13:43.531 align:middle
I'll play along with your family
visitors or whoever they are.

00:13:43.615 --> 00:13:46.618 align:middle
Yeah? Aw, I could never defeat
you with strength though.

00:13:46.701 --> 00:13:48.536 align:middle
Who said it had to be physical?

00:13:51.289 --> 00:13:52.791 align:middle
There's no way
I'm going to lose this!

00:13:52.874 --> 00:13:54.668 align:middle
You dare to challenge me, human?

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:57.629 align:middle
You'll never defeat me
no matter how hard you try!

00:13:57.712 --> 00:13:59.964 align:middle
Hey! No fair!
You can't use instakill combos!

00:14:00.048 --> 00:14:01.174 align:middle
[TAKIYA]
Weak humans have no choice!

00:14:01.257 --> 00:14:02.634 align:middle
We'll use any means necessary!

00:14:02.717 --> 00:14:04.302 align:middle
[FAFNIR growls]

00:14:08.056 --> 00:14:10.016 align:middle
You assume I'm cool enough
to teach you something based

00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:12.602 align:middle
on my neat outwardly appearance.

00:14:12.686 --> 00:14:14.688 align:middle
That means being a cool guy
starts with creating

00:14:14.771 --> 00:14:16.773 align:middle
your own individual look.

00:14:18.608 --> 00:14:20.110 align:middle
[gasps]

00:14:27.325 --> 00:14:28.576 align:middle
Just the other day,

00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:31.246 align:middle
I went as far as where
the rivers meet by myself.

00:14:31.329 --> 00:14:34.499 align:middle
I guess if that's true, then you
are worthy of praise, my friend.

00:14:34.582 --> 00:14:38.003 align:middle
It's so true!
I have pictures to prove it!

00:14:38.086 --> 00:14:40.880 align:middle
[KURAMOTO] Oh, nice!
That's a really cool photo!

00:14:40.964 --> 00:14:42.841 align:middle
I know! It's incredible!

00:14:42.924 --> 00:14:43.842 align:middle
[laughs]

00:14:43.925 --> 00:14:44.843 align:middle
Stop that!

00:14:44.926 --> 00:14:46.386 align:middle
Whatever, Hachisuka!

00:14:46.469 --> 00:14:48.680 align:middle
Even caterpillars
go there by themselves!

00:14:48.763 --> 00:14:49.889 align:middle
What are you saying?!

00:14:49.973 --> 00:14:52.600 align:middle
Think you can
make it there, too?

00:14:52.684 --> 00:14:53.935 align:middle
Of course I can!

00:14:54.019 --> 00:14:55.645 align:middle
Fine, go there by yourself!

00:14:55.729 --> 00:14:57.564 align:middle
And bring back
pictures as proof!

00:14:57.647 --> 00:15:00.191 align:middle
Like, the easiest
challenge ever!

00:15:00.275 --> 00:15:01.985 align:middle
Now what do I do...?

00:15:02.068 --> 00:15:05.113 align:middle
I'm so dumb.
Why'd I have to say that?

00:15:05.196 --> 00:15:07.032 align:middle
We can do it together.

00:15:07.115 --> 00:15:08.366 align:middle
But...

00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:10.410 align:middle
We're gonna have to walk
a long way to get to where

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:11.745 align:middle
the rivers meet.

00:15:11.828 --> 00:15:13.788 align:middle
Go team! We can do this!

00:15:13.872 --> 00:15:16.541 align:middle

00:17:21.374 --> 00:17:24.627 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] Oh, thank you!
Georgie's very good at cooking!

00:17:24.711 --> 00:17:26.338 align:middle
[BOTH]
Thank you for our food.

00:17:28.631 --> 00:17:29.841 align:middle
Ah...

00:17:31.593 --> 00:17:34.471 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Mm. Hmm...

00:17:34.554 --> 00:17:38.600 align:middle
Ah! I dropped it!
Will you help me, Kanna?

00:17:38.683 --> 00:17:41.144 align:middle
Would you mind if
I shared your chopsticks?

00:17:42.562 --> 00:17:45.065 align:middle
[KANNA] You can use these.
They're my spare ones.

00:17:45.148 --> 00:17:48.234 align:middle
Thank you so much!
I'll take good care of them!

00:17:48.318 --> 00:17:49.736 align:middle
[growls]

00:17:54.783 --> 00:17:56.076 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
I can use this!

00:17:56.159 --> 00:17:58.328 align:middle
Nice one, Georgie! Thank you!

00:17:58.411 --> 00:18:00.705 align:middle
Hey, Kanna, want some of
my potato straws?

00:18:00.789 --> 00:18:02.332 align:middle
Yes, please.

00:18:02.415 --> 00:18:03.875 align:middle
'Kay, uh...

00:18:05.627 --> 00:18:07.462 align:middle
Here, have some.

00:18:10.131 --> 00:18:11.299 align:middle
[SAIKAWA huffs]

00:18:12.342 --> 00:18:15.470 align:middle
[whimpering]

00:18:16.471 --> 00:18:19.099 align:middle
[shrieks]

00:18:20.392 --> 00:18:23.228 align:middle
Saikawa, want some
rolled omelets?

00:18:23.311 --> 00:18:26.523 align:middle
[SAIKAWA sighs]
No. My heart is so full...

00:18:26.606 --> 00:18:27.982 align:middle
[KANNA]
Too bad.

00:18:28.066 --> 00:18:30.318 align:middle
I ate some of it already,
but it's still really yummy.

00:18:30.402 --> 00:18:32.320 align:middle
You ate some?!

00:18:32.404 --> 00:18:33.905 align:middle
Nom!

00:18:33.988 --> 00:18:35.907 align:middle
Indirect kiss...

00:18:49.129 --> 00:18:52.048 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] There are
all kinds of people here.

00:18:52.132 --> 00:18:54.134 align:middle
I wonder why
everyone's at the river.

00:18:55.677 --> 00:18:57.721 align:middle
[KANNA]
I love rivers so much.

00:18:57.804 --> 00:18:59.889 align:middle
It feels good
to bathe in the water.

00:18:59.973 --> 00:19:00.974 align:middle
You do what?!

00:19:01.057 --> 00:19:02.142 align:middle
--[gasps]
--[KANNA] Mm-hmm.

00:19:02.225 --> 00:19:04.978 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Kanna bathes in the water!

00:19:05.061 --> 00:19:06.855 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Kanna!

00:19:06.938 --> 00:19:08.440 align:middle
[KANNA]
Oh...!

00:19:12.402 --> 00:19:14.446 align:middle
Kanna's such an angel!

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:16.865 align:middle
[splashing]

00:19:19.325 --> 00:19:20.785 align:middle
[BOTH gasp]

00:19:20.869 --> 00:19:23.788 align:middle
[ELMA]
This feels so good!

00:19:23.872 --> 00:19:25.123 align:middle
[laughs]

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.877 align:middle
Lady Elma, you forgot
your perception blocking.

00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:29.878 align:middle
[shrieks]

00:19:29.961 --> 00:19:31.212 align:middle
[ELMA]
Oh, no!

00:19:31.296 --> 00:19:34.424 align:middle
[gasps]
Wait! I need photo evidence!

00:19:36.885 --> 00:19:38.762 align:middle
Kanna, you're in the way! Move!

00:19:38.845 --> 00:19:39.804 align:middle
So cute!

00:19:39.888 --> 00:19:41.431 align:middle
I can't right now!

00:19:41.514 --> 00:19:44.642 align:middle
[BOTH grunting]

00:19:44.726 --> 00:19:47.604 align:middle
--Huh?
--[KANNA] Hmm?

00:19:47.687 --> 00:19:49.230 align:middle
What? Where'd it go?!

00:19:49.314 --> 00:19:50.940 align:middle
[sighs]

00:19:54.027 --> 00:19:56.821 align:middle
Look, Kanna! We did it!

00:19:56.905 --> 00:19:59.240 align:middle
We made it to where
they said they meet!

00:19:59.324 --> 00:20:01.076 align:middle
[KANNA]
Yeah!

00:20:01.159 --> 00:20:03.370 align:middle
[SAIKAWA] We need to get
a photo for proof!

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.540 align:middle
Like me to take it for you?

00:20:14.381 --> 00:20:15.632 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
If you can, thanks!

00:20:15.715 --> 00:20:17.300 align:middle
[MAN 206B]
Sure.

00:20:17.384 --> 00:20:19.594 align:middle
--Okay... here we go.
--Yay!

00:20:19.678 --> 00:20:21.638 align:middle
That's a cute pose, Kanna!

00:20:23.682 --> 00:20:25.975 align:middle
[SAIKAWA, KANNA]
Thank you very much!

00:20:26.059 --> 00:20:27.602 align:middle
Where did you two come from?

00:20:27.686 --> 00:20:29.479 align:middle
From Oborozuka.

00:20:29.562 --> 00:20:32.399 align:middle
My, that's quite
a walk, isn't it?

00:20:32.482 --> 00:20:33.692 align:middle
Yeah, but it's been fun!

00:20:33.775 --> 00:20:35.652 align:middle
We got to see where
the rivers meet.

00:20:35.735 --> 00:20:39.114 align:middle
Oh? Well, you know,
they've only met at this spot

00:20:39.197 --> 00:20:41.241 align:middle
since they changed
the flow of the river.

00:20:41.324 --> 00:20:43.326 align:middle
[GIRLS]
Ohh...

00:20:43.410 --> 00:20:45.245 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
Why did they change it?

00:20:45.328 --> 00:20:46.788 align:middle
[MAN 206B] They believed it
would prevent floods

00:20:46.871 --> 00:20:50.625 align:middle
from happening and that it
would be easier to grow rice.

00:20:51.960 --> 00:20:52.877 align:middle
Later.

00:20:52.961 --> 00:20:54.713 align:middle
Be careful now.

00:20:54.796 --> 00:20:56.506 align:middle
[SAIKAWA]
'Kay!

00:20:59.342 --> 00:21:01.219 align:middle
What's the matter? You okay?

00:21:01.302 --> 00:21:04.806 align:middle
Do you think
I'm gonna change, too?

00:21:04.889 --> 00:21:06.141 align:middle
Well, of course you will!

00:21:06.224 --> 00:21:08.435 align:middle
You'll keep getting
cuter and cuter!

00:21:08.518 --> 00:21:09.936 align:middle
I'm looking forward to it!

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:11.646 align:middle
And are you gonna change?

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:12.981 align:middle
Oh, yeah!

00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:16.609 align:middle
Obviously, someday,
I'm gonna be a fierce woman!

00:21:27.579 --> 00:21:31.249 align:middle
I'm telling you the truth!
We saw a monster in the river!

00:21:31.332 --> 00:21:32.500 align:middle
Huh...?

00:21:32.584 --> 00:21:34.627 align:middle
No way something
like that exists!

00:21:34.711 --> 00:21:36.379 align:middle
Can you tell us
what it was like?

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:39.883 align:middle
Huge! It was this big
and bathing in the river.

00:21:39.966 --> 00:21:40.884 align:middle
Right, Kanna?

00:21:40.967 --> 00:21:43.136 align:middle
Saikawa, that was a CG.

00:21:43.219 --> 00:21:46.222 align:middle
[gasps]
Are you sure...? Aw...

00:21:46.306 --> 00:21:48.308 align:middle
So it was like an AR
or something?

00:21:48.391 --> 00:21:50.185 align:middle
I told you it was gonna be fake.

00:21:50.268 --> 00:21:51.644 align:middle
That's good.

00:21:51.728 --> 00:21:54.230 align:middle
[SAIKAWA whines]
For real though...?

00:21:54.314 --> 00:21:55.815 align:middle
Wasn't it neat?

00:21:55.899 --> 00:21:57.150 align:middle
Uh...

00:23:28.742 --> 00:23:31.703 align:middle
[SHOUTA] Hi, Miss Kobayashi!
Good afternoon!

00:23:31.786 --> 00:23:33.538 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Huh? What's going on, Shouta?

00:23:33.621 --> 00:23:36.041 align:middle
[SHOUTA]
Did it happen?! Am I cool yet?

00:23:36.124 --> 00:23:38.960 align:middle
[KOBAYASHI]
Takiya? What did you do...?

00:23:42.881 --> 00:23:45.508 align:middle
