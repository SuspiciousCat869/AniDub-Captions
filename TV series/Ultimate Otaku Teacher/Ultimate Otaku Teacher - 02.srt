never heard of it?

What?

00:00:14,375 --> 00:00:15,916
I like wearing
yukata on dates?

Or yummy dinners?

00:00:17,875 --> 00:00:18,916
Wrong!

7
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,791
It's a debilitating
illness where you

8
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:23,708
can only do what
you yearn to do.

this on my own didn't I?

We are so sorry, Minako.

64

if you hadn't made me get
that abhorrent teaching job.

[JUNICHIRO cheers]

66
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:25,208
[JUNICHIRO] It's such a
pity how my busy schedule

67
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,333
leaves me with no free time,
so I'm forced to scramble

68
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,916
to catch up on
chores all weekend!

69
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,125
But if you let me quit,

70
00:04:31,208 --> 00:04:33,083
then we can have fun
like this all the time!

71
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:35,416
That's totally not true.
You holed yourself up

72
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:38,416
in your room every day
before you were a teacher.

73
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,916
Yeah, 'cause you
wouldn't give me

any spending money for figures,
you spiteful little beast.

Ow!

Ugh, shut up!

It's all my fault, per uge!

78
00:04:46,916 --> 00:04:49,083
You know, I was going to
buy you a present today

00:04:49,166 --> 00:04:50,791
to celebrate your one
month of hard work;

80
00:04:50,875 --> 00:04:52,000
which was practically a miracle!

But if you wanna be
an ass, then forget it!

[JUNICHIRO]
Let's not be hasty!

83
00:04:55,791 --> 00:04:58,250
Maybe we should go to that
anime store and talk this over!

Why are you acting weird?

Well, for the past few days,

90
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,500
I've had the distinct feeling
that someone was watching me.

What?

Are you sure?

00:05:26,375 --> 00:05:28,541
Yeah, maybe I'm crazy.

You ignorant plebeian!

Yes! Of course it's good!

110
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:57,833
And it's gutsy, because it's
an original piece

111
00:05:57,916 --> 00:06:00,041
not based off of a
manga or light novel!

112

is throwing down the gauntlet!

He said he'd retire
if it didn't sell!

The themes are so
incredibly complex

115
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:07,958
and the setting and
presentation are so unique

116
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:10,708
that the audience can
barely even keep up!

Okay. But why don't
you just order it online?

It's you.

You're the class rep,
Yukino, right?

166
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,625
I hate you so much.

167
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:18,708
I did this because you aren't
teaching our class properly!

168
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:22,583
Now, my practice exam
scores are dropping!

169
00:08:24,083 --> 00:08:25,333
[JUNICHIRO]
I don't get it.

170
00:08:25,416 --> 00:08:27,833
So you decided
to steal something?

171
00:08:27,916 --> 00:08:30,833
That's a pretty weak excuse.

172
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:31,791
Apologize!

173
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:33,291
Never!

174
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:34,750
[JUNICHIRO]
Not to me.

Huh?

178
00:08:39,375 --> 00:08:41,250
Audiences are still
blind to its genius

179
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:43,750
and home video sales
aren't quite profitable yet!

180
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:46,458
Don't you realize when an
idiot like you steals a copy,

181
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,708
the store has to sell 10
more just to break even?

182
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,541
Anime isn't some
mainstream interest!

183
00:08:50,625 --> 00:08:52,875
Every single sale counts!

184
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,916
I think you lost me.

185
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,791
You know Tani-Kan's
career is on the line here.

186
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,208
If monsters like you
keep picking on him,

187
00:08:58,291 --> 00:08:59,625
he's gonna be forced to retire!

[YUKINO]
I don't know who that is.

189
00:09:02,166 --> 00:09:04,583
Maybe you were just doing
something stupid to vent,

190
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,958
but that can still make
other people suffer.

191
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,541
You can't just waltz
through your life

192
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,625
stepping over everyone else.

193

[YUKINO] Whether I buy into
the whole YD thing or not,

198
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:22,000
you get to do whatever you
want and no one stops you.

199

Your students still
have to worry about

200

their entrance exams, but that's
not your problem, I guess.

Please, there's no
need to thank me.

209

Interesting. That's why
it smells like chalk.

It does not!

237

This is supposed
to be an apology!

238

Okay. I can live with that.

some tips from the pro?

playing that game?

[JUNICHIRO chuckles]

247
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:12,083
[MINAKO] It started when
you got our class into it,

248
00:11:12,166 --> 00:11:14,250
but once the rest of the
students saw us playing,

249
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,750
they wanted in too.

250

Now, it's like a school
wide event, almost.

Pretty cool.

252
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,875
It's got one of those
dumb "free to play,

want the good items, though.

In other words,

poverty-stricken students like
me don't stand a chance.

You can't get by in

They aren't made for people
like you and me, after all.

468
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:40,041
They're made for the
guys who make them.

469
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:43,416
These rules, designed to keep
you ignorant and powerless,

470
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:46,166
are going to hound you for
the rest of your lives.

00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,416
So if you have a dream
that you want to fulfill,

then fight for it, and don't

00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,875
[STUDENTS chatter]

480
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,125
The game.

481
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,583
[MIHO] He didn't make
this just now, did he?

482
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,541
[STUDENTS cheer]

483
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:20,708
[JUNICHIRO]
You see that?

484
00:20:20,791 --> 00:20:22,375
I've given each of
you a special weapon,

485
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:25,000
limited by your imagination
and nothing else.

486
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,125
No money needed,
no grinding needed.

487
00:20:27,208 --> 00:20:28,833
Customize it however you want,

488
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,833
be creative and win
by your own merits.

489
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:31,875
[gasps]

490
00:20:31,958 --> 00:20:33,458
It's got one of
those "free to play,

491
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:36,916
pay to win" systems, so students
like me don't stand a chance.

492
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:41,958
But rules are rules, it's not
like they can be changed, right?

493
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,750
[BOTH giggle]

494
00:20:43,833 --> 00:20:45,250
[JUNICHIRO] I don't care
if the game developer

495
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:48,458
set down the rules.
You decide how to play.

496
00:20:48,541 --> 00:20:51,625
And that goes for life, as well.

497
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,291
[gasps]

498
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,541
Live by your own rules!

499
00:20:55,625 --> 00:20:57,916
Sharpen the weapon
in your heart!

500
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,583
Don't quit, make reality
bow down to your will!

501
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:06,208
Just do that, and the
future will be all yours.

502
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,791
[ALL gasp]

503
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:13,833
[cheering]

504
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:35,625
My final lesson is over.

505
00:21:35,708 --> 00:21:38,416
--[KOYOMI] No.
--[JUNICHIRO] Huh?

506
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,166
[KOYOMI] I'm afraid you have
much more teaching to do.

507
00:21:41,250 --> 00:21:43,166
Yeah? Says who?

508
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,583
[KOYOMI] The chairperson
of Hiiragi Academy.

509
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:50,583
My name is Koyomi Hiiragi.

510
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,250
I'm here to recruit you.

511
00:21:53,666 --> 00:21:56,416
Mr. Junichiro Kagami.

512
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:32,958
[KOYOMI] Don't think of what
happened as a tragedy,

513
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:36,125
Mr. Kagami, think of
it as an opportunity.

514
00:23:36,208 --> 00:23:39,166
Hiiragi Academy can put your
talents to much better use,

515
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,500
I assure you.

516
00:23:40,583 --> 00:23:41,541
Next episode.

517
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:43,291
Bravo team, Charlie Team.

518
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:45,583
I want you to lock
down all of Akihabara!

519
00:23:45,666 --> 00:23:47,750
We have a new
teacher on the loose.

520
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,416
Period Three:
"Chase in Akihabara."

521
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,333
I didn't know you
hated teaching so much,

522
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,666
or perhaps there's something
you're not telling us?

523
00:23:54,750 --> 00:23:55,833
[KOYOMI chuckles]
