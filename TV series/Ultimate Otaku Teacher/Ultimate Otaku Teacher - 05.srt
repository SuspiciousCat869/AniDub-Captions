You're happy doing what you love

and you make a lot of other
people happy when you do it.

11

It's nothing to be ashamed of.

won't kill me.

Losing my whole way
of life, on the other hand,

Yes, ma'am.

I understand that man is your
favorite and you have high hopes

for him and his
"amusing" methods.

48
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,625
But I must once again
voice my concerns.

49
00:03:17,708 --> 00:03:20,791
I have no confidence in his
ability to educate others.

50
00:03:20,875 --> 00:03:23,500
Keeping that in mind, should he
get himself into any trouble,

51
00:03:23,583 --> 00:03:25,125
I, as the head of
the student council,

52
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,208
will not be coming to his aid.

[KOYOMI]
He has requested that I

Your showdown will be
in seventy-two hours.

The rules are simple:
there are none.

the other admit defeat.

[SEIJURO]
Hm...

179

Figures. You'd think I'd be
used to your crazy ideas by now.

180
00:07:51,583 --> 00:07:52,583
Fine, three days,

181

I'll be looking forward to it.

[SUZUNE gasps]

185
00:07:58,958 --> 00:08:00,750
Miss Hiiragi. I was
hoping you would actually

186
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:02,666
put some consideration
into this!

187
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,083
But you just publicly named
him a teacher on a whim.

188
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:07,000
you should be more
careful than that!

189
00:08:07,083 --> 00:08:08,708
assure you, my consideration

190
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,666
was quite careful
and done at length.

191
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:12,083
Liar, liar, pants on fire!

192
00:08:12,166 --> 00:08:13,583
Of course!

193
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,333
He's assigned to teach my grade.

194
00:08:15,416 --> 00:08:17,250
But it's probably for the best.

195
00:08:17,333 --> 00:08:19,666
This way, things should
be easier for you.

196
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:21,958
Why, because I'll have
you there with me?

197
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,250
[SUZUNE] No, because my class
has less kids in it right now.

198
00:08:25,333 --> 00:08:28,791
About half my grade's been
sent to the hospital by Nanami.

Mr. Kagami!

203

Someone help me get
him to the nurse's office!

Hey, everyone, I found

These are the last few
fleeting moments of my life.

207
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:54,041
Soon, I will be but a memory
just like that leaf.

208
00:08:54,125 --> 00:08:56,208
No quarters, no continues!

Will you please stop being
so dramatic already?

210
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:00,208
Seriously, I can handle Nanami.

211
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:02,708
There's no reason for you
to get so worked up, okay?

We need a plan.

215
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:08,875
And I think I've
got just the idea!

216
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,250
I met someone online

217
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,666
who's a real pro at handling
situations like this.

218
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,833
I think we should
ask for their help!

you contacted me.

You know I'm not involved with
that kinda stuff anymore.

[JUNICHIRO]
It's a girl.

231

[GIRL] There should be a rule
about not dragging people back

232
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,666
to their past after
they've moved on.

Wait, I know this voice!

You okay?
You're acting weird, dude.

235

Even if there were, don't forget
what you told me the other day.

in life by doing

more training first!

mentors you on this stuff

is an ex-student of my bro's?

Talk about a small
world wide web.

[KIRIKO]
I had no idea either!

254
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:32,416
[gasps] He said he'd
take responsibility

255
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:35,750
for what he made me bear,
but then he walked out on us!

256
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:37,333
Deadbeat!

257
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:40,250
Okay, when you say it that way,
it sounds really, really bad!

258
00:10:42,208 --> 00:10:44,208
Guess that Seijuro's
still up to no good.

259
00:10:44,291 --> 00:10:47,208
I was hoping he would've
grown out of it by now.

260
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:50,083
[JUNICHIRO] Wait. You mean
you actually know Cyborg?

261
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:51,625
Yeah.

262
00:10:51,708 --> 00:10:53,916
"Cyborg" and I met when we were
classmates in middle school.

263
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,958
Back in the days when I
was making a lot of trouble,

264
00:10:56,041 --> 00:10:59,000
he was just starting out,
so I took him under my wing.

265
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:02,041
Man, he must have
seriously needed

266
00:11:02,125 --> 00:11:04,791
some guidance to listen
to you. No offense.

267
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,958
His father was a
really good, and proud,

268
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,666
professional baseball player.

269
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,625
So ever since he
was a little kid,

270
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,666
Seijuro was trained
to be an athlete.

271
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:14,125
[laughs]

272
00:11:14,208 --> 00:11:15,291
[MINAKO]
His dad always said,

273
00:11:15,375 --> 00:11:17,375
"don't let anything
stand in your way."

274
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,458
That was his belief, so it
became Seijuro's, too,

275
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:24,083
[MINAKO] And by the time he
was in the seventh grade,

276
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,333
he had already become
a top-class pitcher.

--[HITTER A grunts]
--[UMPIRE] Strike!

279
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,083
[MINAKO] But his dad
made a lot of enemies

280
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:33,375
over the course of his career.
It isolated him.

281
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:35,750
And then the media tore him
apart after he got injured

282
00:11:35,833 --> 00:11:37,541
and was forced to retire.

283
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,708
[MINAKO] Illness set in,
and he died in shame.

284
00:11:44,541 --> 00:11:48,416
Something inside of Seijuro
changed that sad day.

285
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:51,458
He hurt his pitching arm but
refused to get off the mound.

286
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,166
He just kept throwing.

287
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:56,458
His teammates said
he was like a monster.

288
00:11:56,541 --> 00:11:58,125
Which you might think
is a good thing,

289
00:11:58,208 --> 00:12:01,125
but not the way they said it.

hey couldn't understand
what had happened to him.

291
00:12:04,458 --> 00:12:08,000
And thus, the son had followed
in his father's footsteps,

292
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:09,791
isolation and all.

293

from playing middle school

here and now on his story

Man, that's crazy.
But how did a problem child

with a past like that
get into Icho Academy?

All right! Stay focused!

00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:12,333
[SEIJURO]
Dad, no!

473
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,416
Come on, you're okay!

476
00:19:23,458 --> 00:19:24,750
I'm here!

00:19:28,958 --> 00:19:30,666
Listen, son.

480
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:35,083
I taught you to destroy anything
that stands in your way.

481
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,083
To never look back.

482
00:19:37,166 --> 00:19:39,416
To keep moving forward,
no matter what.

483
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,000
Yeah!

484
00:19:41,083 --> 00:19:43,625
That's why I know you won't let
this stupid disease beat you!

485
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:44,875
[SEIJURO'S FATHER]
Listen!

486
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,500
Living your life that
way will alienate you.

487
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:53,166
One day, you'll be all alone,
with nothing left but regret.

[SEIJURO'S FATHER
breathes heavily]

490
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,000
[SEIJURO]
His arms look like twigs,

491
00:20:01,083 --> 00:20:03,583
when they used to
look like tree trunks.

492
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:08,208
[NURSE] Mr. Nanami, hold on!
[SEIJURO] This isn't him.

493
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:10,166
This isn't my dad!

494
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:15,708
[SEIJURO] He would never
deny his own way of life.

495
00:20:15,791 --> 00:20:18,000
He'd never give up like that.

496
00:20:19,625 --> 00:20:21,291
[SEIJURO]
Dad would never lose!

497
00:20:22,541 --> 00:20:26,375
Hey, tough guy!
Back up. Let's talk.

498
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:28,916
[SEIJURO]
And neither will I.

499
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,500
[DELINQUENT] So what
are you waiting for?

500
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:34,958
You owe me an apology,
now let's hear it!

501
00:20:35,041 --> 00:20:37,083
[growls]

502
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:39,958
[SEIJURO] You shouldn't
have got in my way!

503
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:46,333
[SEIJURO]
I'm happy for you, Miss Kanou.

504
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:49,875
But there's no place
where I belong.

505
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:52,250
All I know is, right now,

506
00:20:52,333 --> 00:20:56,541
I have to move forward,
but he's standing in my way.

507
00:20:58,416 --> 00:21:00,625
[SEIJURO]
I'll never back down.

508
00:21:08,125 --> 00:21:10,500
[SEIJURO] I can't believe
you actually showed up.

509
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,291
That's what I was thinking.

510
00:21:12,375 --> 00:21:14,666
You're looking pretty worn out.

511
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,083
I've been practicing this game

512
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:18,000
for the last two days
without stopping.

513
00:21:18,083 --> 00:21:19,208
Not even for sleep.

514
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,750
But it's all good,

515
00:21:20,833 --> 00:21:23,166
I got plenty of fight left in
me to go one game with you.

516
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,791
[JUNICHIRO] Good. I was
a bit worried, actually.

517
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:27,750
[SEIJURO]
Uh...

518
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,458
Because we're gonna
play soccer now,

519
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:33,125
and I want you at your best.
So you sure you're up for it?

520
00:21:33,208 --> 00:21:34,875
Wait. But you said--?

521
00:21:34,958 --> 00:21:38,250
That we were playing a game,
but I never specified which.

522
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:41,791
It's not my fault you assumed we
were gonna play video games.

523
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,083
'Cause soccer's
on the itinerary.

Wait! Dammit!

teams go head-to-head

Winner take all.

anything about me!
