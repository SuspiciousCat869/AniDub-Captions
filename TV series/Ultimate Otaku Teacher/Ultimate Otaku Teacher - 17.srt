Koutaro's back at school,
and in a girl's uniform, too!

It looks good, but a
shrine maiden's outfit

for diamonds in the rough,

Wait, what, you didn't hear?

[FEMALE PLAYER B] Remember that

13

She was competing
with her partner, First,

14
00:01:57,041 --> 00:01:58,583

Anyway, he lost and the
admins erased his account.

doing okay?

20
00:02:12,166 --> 00:02:14,333
Yeah! Same old, same old.

21
00:02:14,416 --> 00:02:16,291
You know, you could
always stop by the house

22
00:02:16,375 --> 00:02:17,375
and see for yourself.

23
00:02:17,458 --> 00:02:18,791
Or better yet,

you can see him every day!

Who's that cute girl?

[MALE STUDENT B] I've never
seen her before, have you?

[MALE STUDENT H] Nah, but I
wanna get to know her!

[MALE STUDENT C] There's no way
the whole school missed her.

Not someone that cute.

Guess it's her first day.

Uh... Koutaro?

[KANAN chuckles]
Well, huh, a girl's uniform.

53

Not what I expected, but I
guess we'll see what happens!

Oh.

I'm so glad you could
make it, Koutaro!

61
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:52,125
I, uh, put a lot of
thought into this.

62
00:03:52,208 --> 00:03:55,208
I decided I didn't wanna be
dishonest about myself.

63
00:03:55,291 --> 00:03:59,333
I had confidence in wearing
this, but was it a bad idea?

'Course not! Just give
people some time.

Hi, Seijuro!

00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,625
Morning. You decided to show up.

70
00:04:11,708 --> 00:04:13,625
Is it a little weird
that I'm wearing this?

71
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,750
No. Is it supposed to be?

72
00:04:15,833 --> 00:04:17,750
I mean, that's what
you usually dress like,

73
00:04:17,833 --> 00:04:19,375
far as anyone's seen.

74
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:23,333
Now, if you started dressing
like a dude all of a sudden,

75
00:04:23,416 --> 00:04:24,458
that would be weird.

76

Uh, thank you, Seijuro.

could make it! Nice!

the way down here? Kinda busy.

new student, so I had to see.

is against the rules.

awfully cute, though.

Thank you so much!

By the way, did you happen to
let our dear otaku teacher

325
00:13:33,666 --> 00:13:34,708
know about this?

326
00:13:34,791 --> 00:13:37,083
Oh. No, should I
have said something?

327
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:40,041
Absolutely not. He'd turn
this into another one of

00:13:40,125 --> 00:13:42,916
his lessons, when we're
totally fine on our own.

[KANAN]
Hm?

351
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,375
This isn't some random shop
at a mall, it's a shrine,

352
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,625
so you say, "Thank you
for the offering."

me at school isn't enough,

How shameless can you get!

But that's all right.
I won't be petty.

I'm her "big sister" now.

That's better than number one.

That's, like, the only one.

I have to set a good example
for my cuteness understudy!

I bet Makina is taking
this hard, though.

She's pretty snooty.

She probably thought
she was hot stuff.

It's funny. Did you
notice the crowd is a lot

thinner in front the two of us?

Oh, that doesn't matter.

This isn't a popularity contest.
We're here to support Koutaro.

so mature about this?

go to the little girl's--

What's going on, guys?

Well, uh, we're having a bit of
a potty time logistical issue.

384
00:15:56,750 --> 00:15:58,791
The boy's room is pretty
much out of the question

385
00:15:58,875 --> 00:16:02,250
with a shrine maiden outfit on,
but Koutaro's still shy about

386
00:16:02,333 --> 00:16:05,291
using the girl's room without
someone else to tag along.

387
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:07,208
That was bound to come
up sooner or later.

388
00:16:07,291 --> 00:16:09,125
Go ahead and help him, Kanan.

I can handle things
here by myself.

freak out about.

buy it yourself, Suzune.

to be a gift from you,

to be more flexible,

476
00:19:33,333 --> 00:19:34,833
but I guess I was wrong!

477
00:19:34,916 --> 00:19:35,875
[grunts]

478
00:19:37,208 --> 00:19:38,916
Wait, is that?

479
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:39,958
Oh.

480
00:19:42,791 --> 00:19:44,125
[JUNICHIRO]
I got it last night.

481
00:19:44,208 --> 00:19:46,250
Suzune made me go
to the festival.

482
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:47,541
Can't really complain, though.

483
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,041
The miko who sold it
to me was real cute.

484
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:50,750
[gasps]

485
00:19:50,833 --> 00:19:52,291
She was a little shy,

486
00:19:52,375 --> 00:19:54,083
but she could teach you
a lot about manners!

487
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,625
[gasps]

488
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:57,458
What, did I hit
a nerve, or something?

489
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,541
I don't think I've ever
seen a face so red before.

490
00:19:59,625 --> 00:20:01,750
[gasps]

491
00:20:01,833 --> 00:20:03,666
[MAKINA]
Silence!

492
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,916
Come back here and take
your punishment like a man!

493
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:10,041
[school bells ring]

494
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,375
I hurt.

495
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,916
I think that girl
needs a new nickname.

496
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,791
"Twin Tailed Gorilla" maybe.

497
00:20:15,875 --> 00:20:17,625
[KOUTARO]
Mr. Kagami!

498
00:20:17,708 --> 00:20:20,000
Mr. Kagami, wait,
let's walk together!

499
00:20:20,083 --> 00:20:23,000
Well, as long as
you don't attack me.

500
00:20:23,083 --> 00:20:24,541
So, how are things?

501
00:20:24,625 --> 00:20:27,666
They're good. I just
wanted to chat.

502
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:32,333
[video game music plays]

503
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,125
[JUNICHIRO laughs] It's not
that I have anything against

504
00:20:35,208 --> 00:20:37,833
gaming online, but it's nice
to play something in the same

505
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:39,250
room with you for a change.

506
00:20:39,333 --> 00:20:40,833
Uh-huh!

507
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:43,041
Nowadays, it feels like
most multiplayer games

508
00:20:43,125 --> 00:20:45,291
are competitive, so we have
to go a little old school

509
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,041
to get the experience
I was hoping for.

510
00:20:48,125 --> 00:20:50,583
But for a long time now, I knew
if we ever met in person,

511
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:53,250
this is the one that I
wanted to play with you.

512
00:20:53,333 --> 00:20:55,125
Yeah?

513
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:58,125
So, what did you need to say?

514
00:20:58,208 --> 00:21:01,125
The reason I finally decided
to go out and come to school

515
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:03,416
was because I wanted to
be with you in real life,

516
00:21:03,500 --> 00:21:05,000
not just online.

517
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,875
That's all I needed to tell you.

518
00:21:09,875 --> 00:21:10,833
Huh?

519
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:14,958
Is this?

520
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,541
Yeah, for you.

521
00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:18,708
Huh?

522
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:22,916
But why?

523
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,458
[JUNICHIRO]
It was Suzune's idea.

524
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:26,916
She was, ah, proud of you
for gathering your courage

525
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,083
and coming to school,

526
00:21:28,166 --> 00:21:30,791
so we wanted to show
some moral support.

527
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:33,208
Well, thanks to
both of you, then.

528
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,041
I don't know if I can live
up to my online reputation,

529
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:39,833
but I'll try my best to be a
good partner in school, too!

530
00:21:39,916 --> 00:21:44,208
Good! Then I'll be
counting on you, partner.

531
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,083
Speaking of which,
eyes on the screen!

532
00:21:46,166 --> 00:21:48,666
[KOUTARO]
Oh, sorry.

533
00:21:48,750 --> 00:21:51,583
[JUNICHIRO] Actually, I'm not so
sure about that good luck charm.

534
00:21:51,666 --> 00:21:53,625
They had a bunch of
part-timers working that day,

535
00:21:53,708 --> 00:21:55,041
so it might not be legit.

536
00:21:55,125 --> 00:21:56,916
[KOUTARO laughs]

537
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,250
[KOUTARO] This is Koutaro
Araki from class two-three.

538
00:23:33,333 --> 00:23:35,333
If I had known school
was going to be this fun,

539
00:23:35,416 --> 00:23:36,833
I would've come a lot sooner!

540
00:23:36,916 --> 00:23:38,708
All's well that
ends well, I guess.

541
00:23:38,791 --> 00:23:42,250
Next episode is about Kazuya.
Miss Momozono's little brother!

542
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:43,458
Remember him?

543
00:23:43,541 --> 00:23:45,375
Anyway, another kid
beat him in a card game

544
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,875
and took a mythic rare
card from his collection!

545
00:23:47,958 --> 00:23:50,500
Period eighteen,
"A Gamer's Pride"

546
00:23:50,583 --> 00:23:53,166
"If you lose something playing,
you win it back playing."

547
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,041
Ha. Ha. That sounds like
Mr. Kagami, all right.
