I'm actually the leader
of Black Oracle Neo,

00:01:53,583 --> 00:01:54,958

Jeez. Hey! Did you have to

I, uh...

59
00:03:55,833 --> 00:03:57,333
I got in contact
with some old buddies

hook us up with the venue.

Then, since half of them
are in my class anyway,

about your family.

he acted like the whole thing

00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,500
But they called the next day.

159
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:40,375
I passed? But how?

160
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,541
[CEO] Don't worry about that.
Your lessons start in a week.

161
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,333
I have high hopes
for you! See ya soon!

162
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,291
[TAKI] You got it?
Congrats! That's awesome!

163
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:51,916
I guess,
but I don't get it.

164
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,750
I didn't even
make it to the aud--

165
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,791
"Hey guys! Nagare here!"

166
00:08:57,875 --> 00:08:59,625
Taki.

167
00:08:59,708 --> 00:09:01,791
Heh. They only saw
like, one photo of you,

168
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,750
so all I had to do
was copy your hairstyle

169
00:09:03,833 --> 00:09:05,166
and I was good to go!

170
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,041
Lucky you've got
such a talented sister here

171
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:09,583
to watch your back, huh?
Just kidding.

172
00:09:09,666 --> 00:09:11,458
I'm not even
half as good as you,

173
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,208
so if I can make it,
you'll be fine!

174
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,500
So then...

175
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,708
I let them know
about the situation.

176
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:20,208
I went to visit
their office as soon as

177
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,875
I got out of the hospital.

178
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,375
I told them I couldn't
take the job.

179
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:27,458
[CEO] It's fine.
I'm not firing you.

180
00:09:27,541 --> 00:09:29,583
I can't accept the job
when I didn't even make it--

181
00:09:29,666 --> 00:09:32,291
Let me tell you something
about that audition.

182
00:09:32,375 --> 00:09:34,625
That entire day,
there was only one girl

183
00:09:34,708 --> 00:09:36,791
who gave a performance
that impressed me

184
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:39,375
and that was Nagare Komiya.

185
00:09:39,458 --> 00:09:41,708
Or, that's who she said
she was, at least.

186
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,083
Though it was clear
that something was up.

187
00:09:44,166 --> 00:09:45,666
He already knew?

188
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,958
Yeah. The CEO saw through
Taki's plan right away.

189
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:54,375
But he wasn't angry at all.
It's more like he was curious.

190
00:09:54,458 --> 00:09:57,666
So who are you really?

191
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:00,125
Nagare Komiya.

192
00:10:00,208 --> 00:10:02,708
No point in lying.
You're plenty talented

193
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,166
and your face looks just
like the girl in the photo,

194
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:08,375
but you're lacking
something, I'm afraid.

195
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,000
What do you mean?

196
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,291
You're too flat.

197
00:10:11,375 --> 00:10:12,750
Huh?

198
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:14,625
[grunts]

199
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,958
[sighs]

200
00:10:16,041 --> 00:10:18,875
Shoulda known this
wouldn't be so easy.

201
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:24,125
I insist that you
give Nagare this job.

202
00:10:24,208 --> 00:10:25,625
First you try to
cheat the system,

203
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,916
then you make demands?

204
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,416
Do you want me to call security?

205
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,083
So, why don't you
tell me what you thought

206
00:10:30,166 --> 00:10:31,375
about my performance?

207
00:10:31,458 --> 00:10:33,875
It was everything
we're looking for.

208
00:10:33,958 --> 00:10:35,750
Well, all right then, good.

209
00:10:35,833 --> 00:10:39,208
'Cause Nagare Komiya's
even better than me.

210
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,958
And trust me,
I'm her twin sister.

211
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:42,791
I've seen her perform
for years now.

212
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:45,875
She's gonna knock your
socks off. You have my word.

213
00:10:45,958 --> 00:10:48,166
Interesting. I like it.

214
00:10:49,166 --> 00:10:50,916
[CEO]
Nagare gets the job.

215
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,500
What? But sir!

216
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,125
We're looking for
diamonds in the rough

217
00:10:54,208 --> 00:10:55,916
and she's our
best bet right now.

218
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,416
We have to be willing
to take a risk

219
00:10:57,500 --> 00:11:00,000
and if the girl doesn't cut it,
then we'll just fire her.

220
00:11:00,083 --> 00:11:01,583
Mr. Gomi!

221
00:11:01,666 --> 00:11:05,041
[CEO] And what does our little
party crasher here intend to do?

222
00:11:05,125 --> 00:11:08,958
I'll take responsibility
if that's what you're asking.

223
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,125
You'll never see me anywhere
in show business again, okay?

224
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,041
From here on out, I swear it's
my sister and my sister alone.

225
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,583
[NAGARE] Even knowing the truth,
he still wanted me onboard,

226
00:11:19,666 --> 00:11:21,166
so I had to agree.

227
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:23,375
He just told me to
live up to Taki's praise,

228
00:11:23,458 --> 00:11:26,791
which of course,
I was adamant about, too.

229
00:11:26,875 --> 00:11:28,708
This never would've
happened without her,

230
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:30,333
so I had to work
as hard I could,

231
00:11:30,416 --> 00:11:33,375
so I wouldn't let her down
no matter what.

232
00:11:34,416 --> 00:11:36,583
[NAGARE] I moved to the city,
took as many lessons

233
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:38,500
as they offered
and practiced in every

234
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:41,166
spare minute I could find.

235
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:43,333
Then before I knew it,
I made my debut

236
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,791
as the lead member
of the 5th Queens.

237
00:11:45,875 --> 00:11:48,083
[CROWD cheers]

238
00:11:48,166 --> 00:11:51,291
[NAGARE] Then,
after my first concert...

239
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:54,166
You were great!
Can you spare time for a fan?

240
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,541
Taki!

241
00:11:55,625 --> 00:11:58,666
I told you! Always knew
you were born to be a star!

242
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,666
All those years of me cheering
you on really paid off!

243
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:04,125
Anyway, I'd better go now.

244
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,083
Wouldn't want anyone else
catching me here.

245
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:08,916
We need to talk! Wait!

246
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:10,166
Don't feel bad.

247
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:11,916
If you found the place
where you belong,

248
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,208
then I can do the same thing!
We're sisters, after all.

249
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:20,708
[NAGARE] After that,
she formed Black Oracle Neo.

250
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,041
She says she's happy,

251
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,208
but I know that's not
where she belongs!

252
00:12:26,291 --> 00:12:28,833
If you saw her audition tape,
you'd understand.

253
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,375
She's as good as I am.

254
00:12:30,458 --> 00:12:32,875
No, honestly,
she's much better than me,

255
00:12:32,958 --> 00:12:34,916
but because of that stupid
promise she made,

256
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:37,625
she'll never get a chance
to show the world!

257
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:39,625
I know I didn't ask her
to do it, but I feel like

258
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:42,333
I stole her whole life
away from her!

259
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:45,625
[crying]

260
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:47,958
Now it all makes sense.

261
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:56,916
[cell phone chimes]

262
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,541
Mr. Kagami?

263
00:12:58,625 --> 00:12:59,791
[cell phone beeps]

264
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:00,833
[JUNICHIRO] We're going
to get rid of all those

265
00:13:00,916 --> 00:13:02,916
little misconceptions of yours.

266
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,500
Come visit me
after work. Mr. Kagami.

267
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,625
[NAGARE]
Where are we going?

268
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,791
[JUNICHIRO] I know it looks
kinda shady from the outside,

269
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,500
but they're holding
an event here.

270
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,833
What kind of event?

271
00:13:18,916 --> 00:13:20,833
Well. Details later.

272
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:24,291
For now, let's get
you changed. Here.

273
00:13:24,375 --> 00:13:25,375
Okay, I put it on,

274
00:13:25,458 --> 00:13:29,166
but this outfit
is really not okay!

275
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:32,375
Also, why does my hair
need to be like Taki's?

276
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:38,666
Idol Sister, as of right now
you're Taki Komiya.

277
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,833
Huh?

278
00:13:39,916 --> 00:13:41,291
[JUNICHIRO]
And like she did for you,

279
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,583
you're going to act
as her emergency stand-in

280
00:13:43,666 --> 00:13:46,416
for what will be a very
important performance.

281
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,291
[NAGARE] Can we
talk about this first?

282
00:13:52,375 --> 00:13:53,958
[JUNICHIRO]
No time!

283
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,208
This is another
important place for Taki.

284
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,000
And you'll see why!

285
00:13:58,791 --> 00:14:00,708
[JUNICHIRO] It's the Fraternal
Force Family Rangers

286
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,583
Fan Gathering!

287
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:05,416
Since you missed
your own audition,

288
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:07,791
this'll be a chance to
prove your sisterly power!

289
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:10,333
My what? I still don't
see the point in this!

290
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,500
You will, though.

291
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:12,708
[CHIYO]
Hey, Taki!

292
00:14:12,791 --> 00:14:14,166
[laughs]

293
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,625
Oh, you made it!
I'm so happy!

294
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,833
Who are you?

295
00:14:17,916 --> 00:14:20,083
You are such a
little kidder, aren't you?

296
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:21,916
Why, I'm your soulmate,
Chiyo, of course!

297
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,750
I don't know what happened
with that group meeting

298
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,166
you were supposed to
go to tonight,

299
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,416
but as long as you're here,

300
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:28,375
we can win this
sing-off for sure!

301
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,958
This venue doesn't
look like much,

302
00:14:30,041 --> 00:14:31,916
but it's popular
for fan gatherings.

303
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,708
In fact, it's so popular that
the different fan groups

304
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,416
have these little
performance showdowns

305
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,916
to decide who
can use the space.

306
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,125
And tonight a new group
is challenging

307
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,500
your sister's group
for their time slot.

308
00:14:43,583 --> 00:14:44,875
Oh, wow.

309
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:47,041
By the way,
your sister has defended

310
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,500
the Family Rangers slot
for two years now.

311
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:51,250
All by herself.

312
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:53,916
[gasps]

313
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:56,166
As soon as
