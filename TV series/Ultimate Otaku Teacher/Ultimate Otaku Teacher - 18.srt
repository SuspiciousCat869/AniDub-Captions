1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
Hey! Don't change that channel!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,958
You don't wanna miss
a second of this one!

3
00:00:12,041 --> 00:00:13,708
You've fallen for
the Mythic rare card?

4
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:15,250
Koutaro has to play Makina?

5
00:00:15,333 --> 00:00:17,041
I've got two lessons today!

6
00:00:17,125 --> 00:00:19,000
All teachers are looking
for diamonds in the rough,

7
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,041
and I Junichiro Kagami,
the Ultimate Otaku Teacher,

8
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,041
always find them first!

9
00:01:49,291 --> 00:01:51,958
[JUNICHIRO]
Good morning!

10
00:01:52,041 --> 00:01:56,916
Is everybody ready to have
an awesome day? Ha, ha, ha!

11
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,500
Hey! How are you?
Lovely weather!

12
00:01:59,583 --> 00:02:05,666
Yo, what's up? Having fun?
Good! Hey! Hi! Morning! Hello!

13
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,666
[GROUP]
Huh?

14
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:08,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Hey, guys! Wait up!

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:09,791
Phew!

16
00:02:09,875 --> 00:02:11,416
Check this out.

17
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:13,375
Sha-bam!

18
00:02:15,708 --> 00:02:16,708
Yeah, whatever.

19
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,958
[JUNICHIRO gasps]
Oh wait, come on!

20
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:21,458
This beauty is the
Legendary Glorious Dragon!

21
00:02:21,541 --> 00:02:24,333
It's a Mythic rare card that I
won by defeating countless foes.

22
00:02:24,416 --> 00:02:26,125
It's a really big deal!

23
00:02:26,208 --> 00:02:27,666
Fear its wrath!

24
00:02:27,750 --> 00:02:30,708
Now you plebeians,
bow before your king!

25
00:02:30,791 --> 00:02:31,625
Rawr! Rawr! Rawr!

26
00:02:31,708 --> 00:02:33,291
What a freakin' loser.

27
00:02:33,375 --> 00:02:35,958
A grown man obsessed
with a children's game.

28
00:02:36,041 --> 00:02:37,833
They're just pieces
of cardboard, dude.

29
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:39,541
[JUNICHIRO]
U-Uh... What?

30
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,666
Do you even listen to
yourself when you talk?

31
00:02:41,750 --> 00:02:42,916
You've got a lot to learn!

32
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,875
So, here comes a lesson.

33
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:47,000
For starters, this is not
just a piece of cardboard!

34
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,375
This card--!

35
00:02:48,458 --> 00:02:50,708
[gasps]

36
00:02:50,791 --> 00:02:52,083
Oh, frak me.

37
00:02:52,166 --> 00:02:54,041
 Seems to me like you're the
one who needs a lesson.

38
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,833
So take notes.

39
00:02:55,916 --> 00:02:57,416
You are a teacher.

40
00:02:57,500 --> 00:03:01,083
Part of education is example,
so if you bring a toy to school,

41
00:03:01,166 --> 00:03:03,375
it's going to end up
getting confiscated.

42
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:04,583
[gasps]

43
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:06,791
[JUNICHIRO] You're being
hypothetical, right?

44
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:09,000
You're not! Don't do this!

45
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:11,291
Stand down!

46
00:03:11,375 --> 00:03:12,416
[yelps]

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:13,666
Idiot.

48
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:20,041
Well, lesson's over.
You okay, teach?

49
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:23,208
She really took my
legendary Glorious Dragon.

50
00:03:29,833 --> 00:03:31,125
[SUZUNE]
Why aren't you eating?

51
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:34,125
I made your favorite meal.
Fried rice omelets!

52
00:03:34,208 --> 00:03:37,416
[sighs]
No, I'm not hungry.

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,750
You feelin' okay? You'd tell
me if you were sick, right?

54
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,458
[JUNICHIRO] Yeah, I'm fine.
Just had a bad day at work.

55
00:03:43,541 --> 00:03:46,083
[SUZUNE] Hm? I can't hear
what you're saying.

56
00:03:46,166 --> 00:03:48,083
[sighs]
Man.

57
00:03:48,166 --> 00:03:50,375
That Twin-Tailed weirdo
knows it's important to me!

58
00:03:50,458 --> 00:03:51,916
Why'd she take it?

59
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,916
Mm. Wait. What did Makina take?

60
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,666
My trading card.

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,125
The Legendary Glorious Dragon.

62
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,791
Shoulda known!

63
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:04,916
[JUNICHIRO whimpers]

64
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,041
[MAKINA]
What's wrong?

65
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:08,625
Why aren't you eating?

66
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:09,791
[KAZUYA sighs]

67
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:11,250
I made your favorite meal.

68
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:12,416
Cheeseburgers.

69
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,041
[KAZUYA]
Oh, uh, right.

70
00:04:15,125 --> 00:04:16,750
It looks great!

71
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,833
You'd tell me if you
were sick, right?

72
00:04:20,916 --> 00:04:22,958
You not feeling
well or something?

73
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:25,458
Oh, no! I feel good, sis!

74
00:04:27,250 --> 00:04:30,291
Yum! Cheeseburger!

75
00:04:30,375 --> 00:04:34,250
I summon Pact of Moth
which skips your turn.

76
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:37,500
I cast Morris the Solemn.
Returns him to my hand.

77
00:04:37,583 --> 00:04:39,375
And skips your turn again.

78
00:04:39,458 --> 00:04:42,125
[KAZUYA] C'mon. I can't
even cast a spell!

79
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:49,166
Inferno. Lose a turn.

80
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:55,041
[KAZUYA gasps]

81
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:59,416
My deck's combo.
Flame God's Hammer!

82
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,583
[CROWD gasps]
Whoa!

83
00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,041
Let's, play another match!

84
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,041
This time, I'll totally--

85
00:05:04,125 --> 00:05:05,458
[KENJI]
Give me a break.

86
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,666
It doesn't matter what you do,
you'll never beat me!

87
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:09,625
Yeah, stick to
playing with blocks!

88
00:05:09,708 --> 00:05:10,666
[grunts]

89
00:05:13,458 --> 00:05:14,958
[KAZUYA]
Hm...

90
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,125
[MAKINA gasps]
Oh, shoot.

91
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:17,708
[gasps]
Huh?

92
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:19,625
[MAKINA] I forgot I
had this in my pocket.

93
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,833
[gasps]

94
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:22,916
[KAZUYA] Makina? Do you
know what that is?

95
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,166
No, why? Is it important?

96
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,583
[KAZUYA]
Yeah!

97
00:05:26,666 --> 00:05:28,666
That would explain why
Mr. Kagami made such a big stink

98
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:30,875
when I took it away from him,
but he really shouldn't have

99
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,916
been showing it
off around school.

100
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,750
He's probably still
crying about it.

101
00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,541
[KAZUYA] That's a super rare,
super powerful card

102
00:05:38,625 --> 00:05:41,083
and it just showed
up in my house!

103
00:05:41,166 --> 00:05:43,291
If I could add that
bad boy to my deck,

104
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:46,541
I might stand a
chance against Kenji!

105
00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,291
[KAZUYA] Hey, sis?
Do you mind if I take that?

106
00:05:49,375 --> 00:05:50,166
[MAKINA]
Huh?

107
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,458
I need to borrow it for a while,

108
00:05:51,541 --> 00:05:52,708
but I'll give
it back, I promise!

109
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:53,916
No. You can't.

110
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,333
I'm only keeping it one night

111
00:05:55,416 --> 00:05:57,875
so he learns he can't
bring his toys to school.

112
00:05:57,958 --> 00:06:00,125
It sounds dumb, but I
know it means a lot to him,

113
00:06:00,208 --> 00:06:03,291
so I'm returning it tomorrow.
As long as he apologizes.

114
00:06:03,375 --> 00:06:05,000
[KAZUYA]
Yeah. Of course.

115
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:08,750
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

116
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,541
[door clatters]

117
00:06:26,625 --> 00:06:27,791
[KAZUYA]
I'm leaving!

118
00:06:27,875 --> 00:06:29,208
[MAKINA]
Have a good day!

119
00:06:29,291 --> 00:06:32,583
Watch where you're going!
Don't run! You might trip!

120
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,416
Now...

121
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:38,750
[gasps]
Where'd the card go?

122
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:41,333
I know I put it in
my pocket last night!

123
00:06:52,875 --> 00:06:55,791
[gasps] Don't tell me,
Kazuya took it?

124
00:06:55,875 --> 00:07:00,833
[KIDS chatter]

125
00:07:04,208 --> 00:07:05,708
[KAZUYA]
I'm sorry, Makina.

126
00:07:05,791 --> 00:07:07,208
But I need this.

127
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:11,500
[KAZUYA pants]

128
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,250
[JUNICHIRO]
I, Junichiro Kagami,

129
00:07:16,333 --> 00:07:19,125
despite being a teacher
at Icho Academy,

130
00:07:19,208 --> 00:07:22,208
brought the Legendary Glorious
Dragon from the Magic the Ring

131
00:07:22,291 --> 00:07:25,875
trading card game to school
as a means to show off.

132
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:29,208
I did this knowing full well it
had nothing to do with class.

133
00:07:29,291 --> 00:07:32,958
I apologize and hereby vow to
never break the rules again.

134
00:07:33,041 --> 00:07:36,958
So, uh. That seemed like a
pretty sincere apology to me.

135
00:07:37,041 --> 00:07:38,416
We'd both truly appreciate it

136
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,291
if you could give
his card back now.

137
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,416
And sorry for the trouble!

138
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,250
[gasps] Would it kill you
to show a little respect?

139
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:48,416
I acknowledge your apology,
but I can't return your card.

140
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:50,000
Just give it back already!

141
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:53,750
No! If you have nothing
else to say. Go!

142
00:07:53,833 --> 00:07:56,208
But... my card.

143
00:07:56,291 --> 00:07:57,458
I think we're done here.

144
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,458
Shouldn't you be
teaching a class?

145
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,500
But, he apologized.

146
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:02,708
[JUNICHIRO]
You will live to regret this,

147
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,166
Twin-Tailed Weirdo, I swear it.

148
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:06,250
[MAKINA]
Hmph.

149
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,291
[SUZUNE] I wonder why
Makina's acting so harsh.

150
00:08:09,375 --> 00:08:11,083
It's not like this
is a big deal,

151
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:12,958
but she's being
really unfair about it.

152
00:08:13,041 --> 00:08:14,833
I swear on Sergeant
Saunders' cannon,

153
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:16,416
vengeance will be mine!

Uh.

Hm?

Sorry to interrupt
your tantrum.

I was kinda maybe hoping you'd
help me talk to a girl I like?

00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,125
[JUNICHIRO groans]

Wait, where are you going?

161
00:08:27,833 --> 00:08:30,250
Are you seriously just going
to ignore me like that?

162
00:08:30,333 --> 00:08:31,416
[JUNICHIRO]
Yes, I am,

163
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,791
I'm in the midst of
plotting my revenge.

164
00:08:33,875 --> 00:08:35,333
And I don't even
know who you are.

165
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:37,000
Oh, right. Forgot about that.

166
00:08:37,083 --> 00:08:39,666
I'm Joe Odawara from the
class next door to yours.

167
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:40,875
Don't care.

168
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:42,791
[ODAWARA] I'm seriously
out of options here.

169
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,291
I want to tell her how I feel,
but I've got a problem.

170
00:08:45,375 --> 00:08:47,375
Sounds real serious, kid.

171
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:48,458
[ODAWARA]
I'll show you.

172
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:50,833
Hold onto this
for a second.

173
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:53,541
[JUNICHIRO] Hm? You just
carry a bucket around?

174
00:08:53,625 --> 00:08:55,125
Hey! How you doin'?

175
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:57,500
Um. I'm good. Thanks.

176
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:58,875
[ODAWARA grunts]

177
00:08:58,958 --> 00:09:02,541
Whoa! That is not a natural
reaction to this at all!

178
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:03,916
You see what I'm
talkin' about?

179
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,250
I can't stop bleeding when
I try to talk to girls.

180
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,041
I just tense up really bad.

181
00:09:08,125 --> 00:09:10,625
That is rough. But considering
I'm not a doctor,

182
00:09:10,708 --> 00:09:12,958
I don't think I'm
qualified to help you.

183
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:14,375
Well, uh...

184
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:17,458
All I'd need you to do is pass
along my message for me.

185
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:19,125
Darn. I guess there's no hope!

186
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,166
[ODAWARA]
Uh! But I'm desperate!

187
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,500
[JUNICHIRO]
I couldn't tell.

188
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:25,250
But that's not my field
of expertise, so bye!

189
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,541
Man. To be so hard up,
this girl must be special.

190
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:32,000
Yeah, she is! I mean, not just
anybody can handle being

191
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:33,333
the head of the
student council!

192
00:09:33,416 --> 00:09:36,333
[JUNICHIRO gasps, pants]

193
00:09:36,416 --> 00:09:38,958
Wait! You're in love
with the Devil?

194
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:43,916
That changes everything,
my good man!

195
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,958
Listen, while it would be easy
for me to deliver your message,

196
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:49,958
It wouldn't do you any
good in the long run

197
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:52,625
without solving your
other problem first.

198
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,083
[JUNICHIRO mocking]
Morning! Thanks for inviting me!

199
00:09:58,166 --> 00:09:59,041
[JUNICHIRO mocking]
Hey, no problem!

200
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:01,958
I'm glad you could make it! Ah!

201
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,166
You'd look like you entered
the blood code before going

202
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,500
on the date, which wouldn't
leave the best impression!

203
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,250
You're right. I'm screwed.

204
00:10:08,333 --> 00:10:09,625
Not yet, you're not!

205
00:10:09,708 --> 00:10:11,000
It'll take a little doing,

206
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,708
but I'll get you up and
talking to girls in no time!

207
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,875
I've got a secret weapon!
And here's the cavalry!

208
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,958
[KOUTARO]
Sorry to keep you waiting!

209
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:20,458
I hurried when I
got your message.

210
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,708
[JUNICHIRO]
It's okay, you're right on time!

211
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,041
This is Koutaro.

212
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:26,875
Don't let the girly outfit
fool you. He's a boy.

213
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,833
He's the talk of the school,
so I'm well aware.

214
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:31,291
Um, hello there.

215
00:10:31,375 --> 00:10:34,125
I don't think we've met,
I'm from class two-three.

216
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:37,208
Nice to meet you.
You can call me Joe.

217
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:40,166
[JUNICHIRO] Now, what if
we give you a new do?

218
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,416
[KOUTARO]
Why?

219
00:10:41,500 --> 00:10:42,708
[JUNICHIRO]
Just a test!

220
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,750
What kind of test requires
me to have pigtails?

221
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:45,833
[gasps]

222
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,291
Hey. What are the
two of you up to?

223
00:10:48,375 --> 00:10:50,416
[JUNICHIRO]
Well? Pretty close, huh?

224
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,666
Yeah, if I didn't know better,

225
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,375
I'd think he and
Makina were twins!

226
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:54,875
What?

227
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,750
[JUNICHIRO] But what we have
here is a boy. Which means?

228
00:10:57,833 --> 00:11:00,791
Right! I'm not bleeding!
Everything's cool!

229
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:02,208
Wait, back up a sec!

230
00:11:02,291 --> 00:11:04,083
Can you please fill me
in on what's happening?

231
00:11:04,166 --> 00:11:05,125
It's simple!

232
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,833
You're going on a date.

233
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,583
In order to save Joe's heart,

234
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:11,833
You must become
"Deus Ex Makina!"

235
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:13,375
I don't get it.

236
00:11:13,458 --> 00:11:14,625
Why me?

237
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,250
[JUNICHIRO]
Koutaro, do you copy?

238
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:21,416
Roger.

239
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,166
I whipped this baby
up over lunch break.

240
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:26,166
It's a program that'll get us
through this difficult time.

241
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,500
I call it "Sim Makina!"

242
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,375
All we gotta do is enter
the current scenario

243
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:32,250
in to this software,
and it will tell us what

244
00:11:32,333 --> 00:11:35,458
course of action to take based
on ol' twin-tails' personality.

245
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,500
'Kay. Let's go.

246
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:40,416
[JUNICHIRO]
Alright. And we're off!

247
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:42,708
What would you like to
do first, "Miss Momozono?"

248
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:44,166
Is there anywhere
you want to go?

249
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:46,166
You'd better slow your roll!

250
00:11:46,250 --> 00:11:47,250
[ODAWARA]
Huh?

251
00:11:47,333 --> 00:11:48,833
That's some nerve
you've got, punk!

252
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,291
I'm the student council head,
which means you fall in line,

253
00:11:51,375 --> 00:11:53,375
'cause ain't nobody
walking beside me!

254
00:11:53,458 --> 00:11:54,500
That'll get you rubbed out!

255
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:57,166
Sorry! Won't happen again!

256
00:11:57,250 --> 00:11:58,500
Wait, what?

257
00:11:58,583 --> 00:11:59,958
I don't think she'd really
say things like that.

258
00:12:00,041 --> 00:12:00,916
Yuh-huh!

259
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,625
[sighs]

260
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:05,083
Well, it's what she's
thinking anyway.

261
00:12:05,166 --> 00:12:07,791
She flaunts her authority to
bend the rules in her favor

262
00:12:07,875 --> 00:12:10,416
while putting down
everyone else around her.

263
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:12,166
I know firsthand.

264
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:14,125
[chuckles]

265
00:12:14,208 --> 00:12:16,958
Really? Alright, if you say so.

266
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,708
[KAZUYA]
Hey! Kenji!

267
00:12:19,791 --> 00:12:21,958
I demand we have a
rematch for yesterday!

268
00:12:22,041 --> 00:12:24,666
No way. You're weak and boring.

269
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:27,500
I'll show you who's weak
and boring, you jerk!

270
00:12:27,583 --> 00:12:29,458
I've got a powerful new
card that'll beat you!

271
00:12:29,541 --> 00:12:31,458
You think one card
is that strong?

272
00:12:31,541 --> 00:12:34,791
[KAZUYA laughs]
Yeah, see for yourself!

273
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:35,708
Oh, wow!

274
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,583
That thing's super rare!

275
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,875
I never thought I'd
see one for real!

276
00:12:39,958 --> 00:12:41,000
[chuckles]

277
00:12:42,416 --> 00:12:44,458
Sure, what the heck?
A rematch might be kinda fun.

278
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,416
Aw, yeah!

279
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,458
But let's make this one special.

280
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,041
How?

281
00:12:49,125 --> 00:12:52,166
We'll play ante4 style and put
all our cards on the line.

282
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:54,750
Makes it exciting,
so whaddaya say?

283
00:12:54,833 --> 00:12:56,250
Uh...

284
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:57,333
[ORANGE HOODIE]
Do it!

285
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,500
[GREEN SHIRT]
What, are you scared?

286
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:00,791
[KAZUYA]
It'll be alright.

287
00:13:00,875 --> 00:13:03,333
This card's stronger
than anything he has.

288
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,708
There's no way I can lose!

289
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,583
[KENJI chuckles]

290
00:13:07,666 --> 00:13:09,000
Okay!

291
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,541
I hope you're ready for
the fight of your life!

292
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:15,791
[ODAWARA] I thought this
would be a good place to start.

293
00:13:15,875 --> 00:13:19,458
Strawberry Land is supposed to
be the cutest store in town!

294
00:13:19,541 --> 00:13:20,833
Oh, wow!

295
00:13:20,916 --> 00:13:22,750
I can see why you'd say so!

296
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,041
You've gotta be kidding me!

297
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:28,583
Huh?

298
00:13:28,666 --> 00:13:29,791
[KOUTARO] Like some stuffed
animals are gonna make me soft.

299
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,791
You must be trippin'!

300
00:13:31,875 --> 00:13:32,666
[yells]

301
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:35,333
[ODAWARA mummbles]

302
00:13:35,416 --> 00:13:36,916
Sorry. Jeez.

303
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,500
[KOUTARO]
Heh!

304
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,000
Then again, maybe I could use
these poor defenseless animals

305
00:13:41,083 --> 00:13:42,458
to protect my fists
while I'm puttin'

306
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:43,625
the hurt on some suckas.

307
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:45,916
Wouldn't want to break
a nail or nothin'.

308
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,250
Hold on, I think your program's
wrong on this one, Mr. Kagami!

309
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,791
I know for a fact Makina
likes cute stuffed animals,

310
00:13:51,875 --> 00:13:53,916
she had them all over her
room when I was visiting.

311
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,791
Those were decoys! They lure
you into a false sense

312
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,041
of security by making
you think she's friendly!

313
00:13:59,125 --> 00:14:01,333
Her villainy
knows no bounds!

314
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,875
That's where she
hides her weapons.

315
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:07,375
Behind those innocent smiling
faces so no one's the wiser!

316
00:14:07,458 --> 00:14:09,541
[KOUTARO]
He has lost his mind.

317
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:12,666
[ODAWARA] This is a great
little place if you like pasta.

318
00:14:12,750 --> 00:14:14,458
[KOUTARO]
Sounds great! I'm starving.

319
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:16,458
[ODAWARA] I'll have
the carbonara, please.

320
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,083
[KOUTARO]
And I would like...

321
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:21,916
Fresh raw meat!

322
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,916
Don't even cook it,
I wanna see the blood!

323
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,583
[BOTH]
Uh...

324
00:14:26,666 --> 00:14:28,166
[chuckles]

325
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:29,833
I can't do this!

326
00:14:29,916 --> 00:14:31,250
[JUNICHIRO]
You have to!

327
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:33,833
Remember, you're not Koutaro,
you're Deus Ex Makina!

328
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:36,208
Consuming raw meat is the
only way she can suppress

329
00:14:36,291 --> 00:14:38,375
the thirst for the
blood of her enemies!

330
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:39,541
[KOUTARO]
You're making this up.

331
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:40,875
[JUNICHIRO]
Oh, no I'm not!

332
00:14:40,958 --> 00:14:42,916
I saw her eating in the
student council room once.

333
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:44,125
it was like a massacre!

334
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:46,791
I had no idea.

335
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,333
[SERVER]
Here's your meal.

336
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,833
We had to cook the surface due
to health code regulations.

337
00:14:51,916 --> 00:14:53,666
[KOUTARO laughs nervously]

338
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,208
[JUNICHIRO]
Moment of truth!

339
00:14:55,291 --> 00:14:58,750
Dive face first into your food!
Utensils only slow her down!

340
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:01,041
She'd never waste a
moment using them!

341
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:02,791
This is how she
prevents her wild side

342
00:15:02,875 --> 00:15:05,333
from committing
greater acts of evil!

343
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,708
It's a show of restraint!

344
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,833
Now! Unleash the beast within!

345
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:10,000
[grunts]

346
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:11,416
[growls]

347
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:12,458
[gasps]

348
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:15,791
[MAKINA growls]

349
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,791
[MAKINA] Kazuya better be
prepared for the reprimanding

350
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:22,208
of a lifetime when he gets home.

351
00:15:24,875 --> 00:15:27,458
[gasps]
Makina, I--

352
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,083
[grunts]

353
00:15:29,166 --> 00:15:33,458
[sobs]

354
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:37,916
It's time.

355
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,375
You ready for the love
confession simulation?

356
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,416
[KOUTARO]
Yeah.

357
00:15:44,541 --> 00:15:46,041
Tell me something, Joe.

358
00:15:46,125 --> 00:15:47,958
lutter?
Do I send your
heart all

359
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,833
Yeah. You do.

360
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,750
Then get down on your
knees and kiss my kicks

361
00:15:51,833 --> 00:15:53,458
to show me you know
your rightful place.

362
00:15:53,541 --> 00:15:55,708
After that we can
be Facespace official.

363
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,375
[ODAWARA]
Uh?

364
00:15:57,458 --> 00:15:58,416
[grunts]

365
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,208
[ODAWARA sighs]

366
00:16:04,291 --> 00:16:06,375
[gasps]

367
00:16:06,458 --> 00:16:08,458
[chuckles]

368
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,291
[MAKINA] What are you
doing in the bushes?

369
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:15,500
[JUNICHIRO] I'm supervising.
This foolish boy has been

370
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:17,750
enchanted by the
siren's song, so to speak.

371
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:19,458
It's up to me to
break the spell.

372
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:22,416
His only hope is seeing how
evil that weirdo really is!

373
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,125
[JUNICHIRO yelps]
M-M-M-Makina!

374
00:16:24,208 --> 00:16:27,625
Oh? I didn't know you were
such a good Samaritan.

375
00:16:27,708 --> 00:16:30,458
But I think your mock up
is a little too docile.

376
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,125
[chuckles]

377
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:33,666
[gasps]

378
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,041
[groans]

379
00:16:37,125 --> 00:16:37,750
[yells]

380
00:16:37,833 --> 00:16:39,500
There can be only one!

381
00:16:39,583 --> 00:16:40,166
[shouts]

382
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:42,000
[grunts]

383
00:16:42,083 --> 00:16:45,125
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm? Mercy?

384
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:48,541
Yes, but only this
one time. I need you.

385
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,916
As much as I hate to admit it,

386
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,041
you're the only one who
can help me right now.

387
00:16:52,125 --> 00:16:54,625
Wait. You need help?

388
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:57,458
Why does that thought scare me
more than getting beat up?

389
00:16:57,541 --> 00:17:00,166
Makina! Hey, I need
to talk to you!

390
00:17:00,250 --> 00:17:01,666
[gasps]

391
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:07,500
Hi! This may seem sudden,
but... Please go out with me!

392
00:17:07,583 --> 00:17:09,958
[MAKINA]
Uh... What?

393
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:13,041
[yells]
You creep!

394
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:15,041
[groans]

395
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:17,041
Okay... Ow.

396
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:20,000
[ODAWARA groans]

397
00:17:21,250 --> 00:17:22,375
[JUNICHIRO]
What?!

398
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:25,125
You lost my mythic rare card?

399
00:17:25,208 --> 00:17:27,083
[KAZUYA sobs]

400
00:17:27,166 --> 00:17:31,000
Aw, man. Well that
explains it. Although.

401
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:33,208
You should've told me why
you couldn't return it.

402
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:36,291
I'm sorry. It's my fault.

403
00:17:36,375 --> 00:17:39,041
So, here's what I
need your help with.

404
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,208
[JUNICHIRO]
This ought to be good.

405
00:17:40,291 --> 00:17:42,041
I would like for you
to avenge Kazuya

406
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:43,708
and get back the
cards in the process.

407
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:45,291
Huh?

408
00:17:45,375 --> 00:17:47,375
What, did I stutter
just now or something?

409
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:49,541
Fight this Kenji kid,
win back the cards,

410
00:17:49,625 --> 00:17:50,916
and everything
returns to normal.

411
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
No. See, the only card
I care about is mine.

412
00:17:54,083 --> 00:17:55,583
Well, if you don't
play against the kid,

413
00:17:55,666 --> 00:17:57,166
you'll never see it again.

414
00:17:57,250 --> 00:17:59,875
Why does this stuff
always happen to me?

415
00:17:59,958 --> 00:18:01,166
Are you serious?

416
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,958
It's because you're
always doing idiotc things

417
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:04,458
like bringing your
toys to school!

418
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,750
I refuse! You need to
get it back yourself.

419
00:18:07,833 --> 00:18:09,500
Like a true gamer.

420
00:18:09,583 --> 00:18:10,625
[gasps]

421
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,916
Card games,
video games, board games.

422
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:15,666
If you lose something playing,
you win it back playing.

423
00:18:15,750 --> 00:18:19,250
That's called "Gamer's Pride"
and it's serious business.

424
00:18:19,333 --> 00:18:22,625
That said. There's no
reason I can't train you.

425
00:18:26,291 --> 00:18:27,458
[JUNICHIRO]
Oh, wow.

426
00:18:27,541 --> 00:18:29,458
You actually have some
pretty good cards!

427
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:31,875
[KAZUYA]
Yeah, but Kenji's super tough.

428
00:18:31,958 --> 00:18:35,416
It doesn't matter how many times
I try, I just can't beat him.

429
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,041
That's why I stole your
legendary Glorious Dragon card

430
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:41,291
from Makina. I thought if I
had a card that awesome, I--

431
00:18:41,375 --> 00:18:44,083
You rely too much on stats
and not enough on strats.

432
00:18:44,166 --> 00:18:45,375
[KAZUYA]
What?

433
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,125
I'm saying even the
strongest card is useless

434
00:18:47,208 --> 00:18:49,125
if your strategy doesn't
accommodate its unique

435
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:50,791
action requirements.

436
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:53,791
So, whether you sink or swim.

437
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,833
[gasps]

438
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,958
[JUNICHIRO]
Depends entirely on you.

439
00:18:57,041 --> 00:18:58,166
[gasps]

440
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,000
Ya ready? My training
isn't gonna be easy.

441
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,833
[KAZUYA]
Hm!

442
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,916
Okay! It's time to
start the lesson!

443
00:19:13,958 --> 00:19:16,666
Hey. Today's Kazuya's rematch.

444
00:19:16,750 --> 00:19:18,250
Oh yeah?

445
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:20,875
Let's hope your training pays
off and we can put this to bed.

446
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:22,916
Thing is, Even the best strategy

447
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,625
depends a little
bit on luck.

448
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:28,541
But that's what makes
the game so interesting.

449
00:19:28,625 --> 00:19:31,500
What's that mean?
You've just got to be cryptic.

450
00:19:39,291 --> 00:19:40,791
Don't rely on the cards.
It's up to me.

451
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:44,875
I can do this. I can win.

452
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:48,791
Let's get this thing
over with. Combat Open!

453
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:55,750
[JUNICHIRO]
Huh?

454
00:19:55,833 --> 00:19:57,500
He still beat me.

455
00:19:57,583 --> 00:19:59,083
That's alright.

456
00:19:59,166 --> 00:20:03,041
Well, as they say, nothing in
life worth having comes easy.

457
00:20:03,125 --> 00:20:05,041
We'll train some
more after dinner.

458
00:20:05,125 --> 00:20:07,666
Go inside. I'll get
the food started.

459
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:46,125
[KENJI]
Man, you're really stubborn.

460
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,166
Here! Please, just take it.

461
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:50,583
I don't wanna battle
you anymore.

462
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,833
It's yours.

463
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,625
I can't. I have to
beat you for it!

464
00:20:54,708 --> 00:20:56,166
[gasps]

465
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,875
[KAZUYA] It won't feel right if
you just give it back to me.

466
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,291
For real? But why not?

467
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:03,916
'Cause of my
gamer's pride, of course!

468
00:21:04,666 --> 00:21:07,166
[KOUTARO]
Mm...

469
00:21:07,250 --> 00:21:08,875
Okay, looks clear!

470
00:21:12,166 --> 00:21:13,166
Hi, Koutaro!

471
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,375
[yells]

472
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,875
Let's walk home together!

473
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:17,625
[KOUTARO groans]

00:21:17,708 --> 00:21:19,250
[JUNICHIRO]
Hey!

475
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,625
Done for the day?

476
00:21:20,708 --> 00:21:22,333
[ODAWARA]
Let me carry your bag for you!

477
00:21:22,416 --> 00:21:23,750
[KOUTARO] Joe hasn't
stopped asking me out

478
00:21:23,833 --> 00:21:25,750
since he got rejected!

479
00:21:25,833 --> 00:21:26,791
I'm stuck!

480
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,000
[JUNICHIRO]
You'd be a cute couple!

481
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,708
Don't encourage him!
Despite the way I dress,

482
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:31,500
and that I talk about
cute stuff all the time,

483
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,416
I'm actually not into dudes!

484
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,250
Do something! You're the
one who got me into this!

485
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:39,416
Sorry, there isn't really
anything I can do about it.

486
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:40,458
[gasps]

487
00:21:42,375 --> 00:21:44,500
Hey, how'd it go this time?

488
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:46,833
[KAZUYA chuckles]

489
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:52,041
Then your lesson's done.
Good job!

490
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,500
[ODAWARA] Koutaro! I
can't live without you!

491
00:21:54,583 --> 00:21:55,541
My life is meaningless--

492
00:21:55,625 --> 00:21:57,500
[KOUTARO]
No means no!

493
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,708
[KAZUYA]
This is Kazuya Momozono,

494
00:23:31,791 --> 00:23:33,291
Makina's little brother!

495
00:23:33,375 --> 00:23:35,958
I finally got Mr. Kagami's
card back, and I even

496
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:37,458
made friends with Kenji!

497
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:40,333
Next episode, we meet some
girls who are part of a street

498
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:43,791
gang and are big fans of the
Fraternal Force Family Rangers!

499
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,500
They say when you're part of a
gang, you're part of a family!

500
00:23:46,583 --> 00:23:48,916
But what about
her real family?

501
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,375
Period nineteen,
"Street Gangs."

502
00:23:51,458 --> 00:23:53,625
t's good for people to
have strong friendships!

503
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,916
I really hope Makina
makes some friends soon.
