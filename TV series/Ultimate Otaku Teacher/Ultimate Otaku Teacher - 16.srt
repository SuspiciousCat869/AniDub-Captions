1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,333
Hey! Don't change that channel!

2
00:00:09,416 --> 00:00:11,666
You don't wanna miss
a second of this one!

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:13,250
The boarding house is haunted?

4
00:00:13,333 --> 00:00:15,791
I'm not gonna miss a
chance to raid that library!

5
00:00:15,875 --> 00:00:17,833
I'll have to give
that ghost a lesson!

6
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:19,833
All teachers are looking
for diamonds in the rough,

7
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,916
and I Junichiro Kagami,
the Ultimate Otaku Teacher,

8
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,875
always find them first!

9
00:01:47,416 --> 00:01:50,250
[JUNICHIRO] What do you mean,
"clean up the boarding house?"

10
00:01:50,333 --> 00:01:51,875
I had to close it
down last year,

11
00:01:51,958 --> 00:01:55,000
but I won't waste time boring
you with the litany of reasons.

12
00:01:55,083 --> 00:01:56,583
[JUNICHIRO]
Uh...

13
00:01:56,666 --> 00:01:59,375
[KOYOMI] I just cannot allow it
to fall into further disrepair.

14
00:01:59,458 --> 00:02:02,416
The time has come to prepare
it for a grand reopening.

15
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:05,291
So, if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like you and your students

16
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:06,791
to stay overnight
in the dormitories

17
00:02:06,875 --> 00:02:08,541
and tidy the place up for me.

18
00:02:08,625 --> 00:02:10,000
I refuse.

19
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:18,416
[SUZUNE] We're cleaning
this whole building?

20
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,750
Yeah, we are!

21
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:21,875
So let's really do a great
job on this one, guys!

22
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:23,583
What's the point of
cleaning some stinky old

23
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:25,375
boarding house no
one's used in a year?

24
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:27,083
Don't worry about her,
Mr. Kagami,

25
00:02:27,166 --> 00:02:28,416
I'd love to help you clean!

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:30,875
"Big Bro Scheme"
is written all over this.

27
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,416
The YD who's usually
chained to his desk

28
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:35,833
is excited about manual labor?

29
00:02:35,916 --> 00:02:37,833
Must be somethin' the
Chairperson told him,

30
00:02:37,916 --> 00:02:40,125
and he ain't bein'
straight with us about it.

31
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:52,791
[JUNICHIRO]
This is it! The holy grail!

32
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:55,125
I've seen bookstores
with less manga! Ha, ha!

33
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,000
You know your brother
too well, huh?

34
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,583
Yeah, I'm majoring
in Junichiro studies.

35
00:02:59,666 --> 00:03:01,291
[JUNICHIRO] This one
is a vintage classic!

36
00:03:01,375 --> 00:03:03,208
And look at this
underground masterpiece!

37
00:03:03,291 --> 00:03:04,625
Huh?

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,791
Maybe we oughta just clean
this mess up the fast way

39
00:03:06,875 --> 00:03:08,166
and get out of here early.

40
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,375
[laughs]

41
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:12,125
[JUNICHIRO]
No! Bad Cyborg! Abort! Abort!

42
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:13,458
[JUNICHIRO grunts]

43
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,875
[JUNICHIRO]
 Owie!

44
00:03:14,958 --> 00:03:16,458
This is stupid.

45
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,541
Hmph. You really think
I'm that messed up?

46
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:23,041
[JUNICHIRO] Cyborgs shouldn't
be programmed with jokes!

47
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,000
You all go and get to work
on the rest of the building!

48
00:03:25,083 --> 00:03:26,666
I'll do this by myself.
Thanks, bye!

49
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,250
[SUZUNE]
Hey! Big bro!

50
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,833
[JUNICHIRO]
Shouldn't you be cleaning?

51
00:03:30,916 --> 00:03:34,958
Hi, little manga, you ready
to find your shelf? Hm?

52
00:03:35,041 --> 00:03:38,958
Who's come back in here?
I said I'd handle it!

53
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:42,000
That's weird. I could've
sworn one of the students

54
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:44,083
was just in here
staring at me.

55
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,541
Must've imagined it.

56
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:51,083
I bet Otaku teacher's
sprawled out

57
00:03:51,166 --> 00:03:53,250
with a dozen open
manga in front of him.

58
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,625
This totally blows.

59
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,791
You're right. Junichiro owes
us a barbecue dinner,

60
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:57,791
at the very least.

61
00:03:57,875 --> 00:03:58,958
[SUZUNE grunts]

62
00:03:59,041 --> 00:04:00,500
Hey! You know we're
not paying for that!

63
00:04:00,583 --> 00:04:02,875
[KISAKI] Whatever, he can
charge it to the chairperson.

64
00:04:02,958 --> 00:04:06,125
Forget that manga of yours,
this is your best idea yet!

65
00:04:06,208 --> 00:04:09,500
My mouth waters just thinking
about some good beef satay!

66
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,291
What do you like? Chicken?
A little piggy wiggy?

67
00:04:12,375 --> 00:04:15,291
Every animal is charming
in its own way, I suppose.

68
00:04:15,375 --> 00:04:16,708
All their little faces.

69
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:19,041
I can see them so
clearly in my mind.

70
00:04:19,125 --> 00:04:22,000
Just going about their
adorable little days.

71
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:24,416
They're too precious to
be somebody's dinner.

72
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,583
[KANAN, SUZUNE groan]

73
00:04:27,833 --> 00:04:29,166
Huh?

74
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:30,500
[FEMALE STUDENT A]
Uh, that's weird.

75
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:32,708
Did someone break
that from outside?

76
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:35,000
[KIRIKO] Either way,
we'd better clean it up quick.

77
00:04:35,083 --> 00:04:36,750
Wait a minute
where'd the mop go?

78
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,375
It was here like
two seconds ago.

79
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,000
[FEMALE STUDENT B]
Seriously, you guys?

80
00:04:40,083 --> 00:04:42,750
I just polished that spot,
and now it's smudged up!

81
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,541
Where's my cleaning rag?
Is someone trying to be funny?

82
00:04:45,625 --> 00:04:47,500
That really hurt!
All right you little punk!

83
00:04:47,583 --> 00:04:48,916
Who did that?

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,416
[SUZUNE]
This is all wrong.

85
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:52,416
But it can't be...

86
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,958
[KANAN yawns]
I'm wiped out.

87
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,333
Really? Well, I'm hyped up!

88
00:04:59,416 --> 00:05:00,291
[KISAKI]
What's wrong?

89
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:01,500
[SUZUNE]
Huh?

90
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:02,958
That's the face someone
makes when their mom

91
00:05:03,041 --> 00:05:05,916
finds their BL manga stash
and it's the hardcore stuff.

92
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,166
[SUZUNE]
Wait, uh, what?

93
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:08,583
Uh, no, I'm fine.

94
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,500
[shower trickles]

95
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:11,541
[KISAKI, SUZUNE]
Huh?

96
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:19,291
All of us just heard a shower
running in here, didn't we?

97
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,458
--[SUZUNE] Hm?

99
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:27,791
[SUZUNE screams]
It's a ghost!

100
00:05:27,875 --> 00:05:29,250
[MALE STUDENT D]
Hold on. Say that again?

101
00:05:29,333 --> 00:05:30,750
[MALE STUDENT 16B]
A ghost?

102
00:05:30,833 --> 00:05:32,041
In the bathroom!

103
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,708
Nobody panic, it was just
a little performance

104
00:05:33,791 --> 00:05:36,375
for my next manga that
features a ghost story.

105
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:37,958
We didn't mean to
startle you guys.

106
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,916
Just ignore us and
our screaming.

107
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,916
I'm sorry.

108
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,125
There's no reason
to start a panic

109
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,416
with the rest of the class.

110
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,000
Huh?

111
00:05:45,083 --> 00:05:46,166
[KISAKI]
Okay.

112
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,583
You know something
you're not telling us.

113
00:05:47,666 --> 00:05:49,750
So let's hear about
this ghost thing.

114

[JUNICHIRO]
Whoopsidaisies!

117
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,375
Guess I conked out from

118
00:05:57,458 --> 00:05:59,833
mainlining too much
of this manga.

119

[MATOME sobs]

120
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,375

00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:07,958
H-Hello?

[grunts, gasps]

124
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:17,208
So scary. Umajima the Rich
Shark sure gives me nightmares!

125
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,708
Wait a second.

126
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,208
You're not one of my students.
What are you, homeless?

127
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:22,458
[gasps]

128
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:24,166
[MATOME] He's talking
to himself, right?

129
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:26,458
I mean, he can't
be talking to me.

130
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,333
Huh? What do you mean?

131
00:06:28,416 --> 00:06:30,208
Who else would I be talking to?

132
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,291
[MATOME sobs]

133
00:06:33,375 --> 00:06:34,708
[JUNICHIRO gasps]
You're flying?

134
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:35,500
[yelps]

135
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,083
[JUNICHIRO]
Or not.

136
00:06:37,166 --> 00:06:39,250
[MATOME] I've been stuck here
as a ghost for an entire year

137
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,500
and you're the first person
who's seen or spoken to me!

138
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:43,333
If no one has
seen you in a year,

139
00:06:43,416 --> 00:06:45,041
you must be quite lonely.

140
00:06:45,125 --> 00:06:46,125
[gasps]

141
00:06:46,208 --> 00:06:47,125
[JUNICHIRO screams]

142
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,166
[KANAN]
There's a ghost?

143
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,208
When I first enrolled
here an upper classman

144
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:53,625
tried to spook me.
But I checked it out,

145
00:06:53,708 --> 00:06:56,416
and there really was an accident
in the dorms about a year ago,

146
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,625
so her spirit
must be stuck here.

147
00:06:58,708 --> 00:07:01,333
[KIRIKO] Yeah, I think I heard
a rumor like that myself.

148
00:07:01,416 --> 00:07:03,416
Doesn't ring any bells
for me, but of course,

149
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:05,083
I wasn't a big talker back then.

150
00:07:05,166 --> 00:07:06,666
If anyone tried to tell me,

151
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:08,083
I'da punched 'em in the jaw.

152
00:07:08,166 --> 00:07:10,416
I skipped last year.
I never heard any gossip.

153
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,416
So, don't look at me.

154
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:15,416
She must be desperate
to reach out to us.

155
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:18,208
[gasps, yelps]

156
00:07:18,291 --> 00:07:19,458
[gasps]

157
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:20,916
Didn't anyone ever tell
you ghosts aren't real,

158
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,125
except in cheesy movies?

159
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,250
How can you expect to
be taken seriously?

160
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:27,083
[gasps, sobs]

161
00:07:27,166 --> 00:07:29,583
[JUNICHIRO] Is she gonna
go all The Grudge on me?

162
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:34,125
[MATOME laughs] This is
such a funny conversation!

163
00:07:34,208 --> 00:07:36,416
So wait, you're happy
all of a sudden?!

164
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,416
Can I please ask you
to do me a favor?

165
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:40,375
What am I gonna do?

166
00:07:42,041 --> 00:07:42,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm?

167
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:44,541
[MATOME]
I beg you.

168
00:07:44,625 --> 00:07:47,375
Can you help me get
to the afterlife?

169
00:07:48,333 --> 00:07:49,583
[JUNICHIRO]
Listen up, Options!

170
00:07:49,666 --> 00:07:52,500
Wanna explain why you
didn't mention the ghost?

171
00:07:52,583 --> 00:07:54,333
So it really was
haunted after all.

172
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:56,875
[JUNICHIRO] "After all?"
You knew about this?!

173
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,333
This was your plan
from the beginning,

174
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:00,250
an Olympic-size
manga library, you said!

175
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:03,458
I don't remember exorcisms
being in my job description!

176
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,958
[KOYOMI]
If I had wanted an exorcist,

177
00:08:05,041 --> 00:08:06,291
I would've hired one.

178
00:08:06,375 --> 00:08:08,416
Surely you can think of
a reason I might choose

179
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:11,000
to entrust this situation
to you in particular.

180
00:08:11,083 --> 00:08:12,416
Why?

181
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:15,125
[KOYOMI] Because! This way
seemed much more amusing.

182
00:08:15,208 --> 00:08:17,500
Anyway, she'll be needing
a guide to the afterlife,

183
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,958
so do your best as a teacher,

184
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:21,791
whether your students
are alive or dead.

185
00:08:21,875 --> 00:08:24,750
[JUNICHIRO grunts, sighs]

186
00:08:24,833 --> 00:08:28,083
Does that mean you're
actually gonna help me out?

187
00:08:28,166 --> 00:08:29,333
[JUNICHIRO]
I think I get it.

188
00:08:29,416 --> 00:08:31,375
You were the victim
of a freak accident,

189
00:08:31,458 --> 00:08:33,708
and because you were so
attached to the books in life,

190
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,958
your spirit couldn't leave them.

191
00:08:36,041 --> 00:08:37,250
I don't know what happened.

192
00:08:37,333 --> 00:08:40,166
I just could never find
my way out of here.

193
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:42,875
So, do you really
love manga that much?

194
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:44,458
[gasps]
'Course I do!

195
00:08:44,541 --> 00:08:46,208
I like all kinds,
but there's one series

196
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,000
that's extra special to me.

197
00:08:48,083 --> 00:08:49,583
Huh?

198
00:08:49,666 --> 00:08:52,541
Classroom of the Terminus is the
greatest manga I have ever read

199
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,541
in my life or ghost life!
Whenever I read Terminus,

200
00:08:55,625 --> 00:08:58,791
I always try to imagine what
Kisaki Tenjoin would be like.

201
00:08:58,875 --> 00:09:01,208
[sneezes]

202

[SEIJURO]
Allergic to ghosts?

203
00:09:02,666 --> 00:09:04,541
[MATOME] I bet she's
lived an exciting life

204
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,125
and been everywhere you
could dream of in the world!

205
00:09:07,208 --> 00:09:10,041
Ha! Yeah right, I could hardly
even get her to go to school!

206
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:11,500
No way! You're kidding!

207
00:09:11,583 --> 00:09:13,083
You mean a high school
student like me

208
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:14,500
wrote something so profound?

209
00:09:14,583 --> 00:09:15,833
Do you wanna know where she is?

210
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:17,375
I could take you
to her right now.

211
00:09:17,458 --> 00:09:18,416

[knocking]

213
00:09:20,833 --> 00:09:23,250
[JUNICHIRO] Hey there, Kisaki.
Mind if I come in?

214
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,083
[SUZUNE]
Junichiro?

215
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:26,125
Sure, why not?

216
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:28,583
Strange you're all here,
but convenient at least.

217
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:30,583
What were you thinking
dragging a bunch of students

218
00:09:30,666 --> 00:09:31,833
to a haunted mansion?

219
00:09:31,916 --> 00:09:33,958
Oh, so you already
know the story.

220
00:09:34,041 --> 00:09:35,458
This is my new friend.

221
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,375
Hi, nice to meet you guys.
I'm your friendly dorm ghost!

222
00:09:38,458 --> 00:09:40,333
[ALL gasp]

223

[SUZUNE screams]

224
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:47,250
Sorry 'bout the window.

225
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:49,208
And I'm sorry I scared
you in the shower, too.

226
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:51,625
But this is the most people
I've seen together in a year,

227
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,166
so I got excited.

228
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:55,083
[I was just trying to
get everyone's attention,

229
00:09:55,166 --> 00:09:58,041
but I guess that
would be kinda scary.

230
00:09:58,125 --> 00:09:59,625
[JUNICHIRO]
This is the Sensei herself,

231
00:09:59,708 --> 00:10:03,416
Kisaki Tenjoin, creator of the
great Classroom of the Terminus.

232
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:03,875
[MATOME]

[ALL gasp]

234
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:06,666
If I need a ghost to
model for my next manga,

235
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,125
I'll let you know, otherwise,
I don't really care.

236
00:10:09,208 --> 00:10:11,583
She's a big fan of yours.
Like, a scary big fan.

237
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:13,250
Why didn't you say?!

238
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:16,208
I'm so sorry!

239
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Sometimes I think she only

240
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:19,958
makes that manga to get fans.

241
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,208
[MATOME]
Wow!

242
00:10:21,291 --> 00:10:22,875
Sensei! Hi!

243
00:10:22,958 --> 00:10:24,583
I can't believe I'm really
meeting the creator

244
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,125
of my all-time favorite manga!

245
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:30,041
Terminus like, totally makes
me ponder the meaning of life!

246
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:32,458
Oh! Uh, here. Look!

247
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,250
I keep this copy of
Volume 1 with me

248
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,708
for when I'm feeling down!
It's a first edition!

[gasps]

250
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,125
[MATOME]
I know it's kind of beat up,

251
00:10:39,208 --> 00:10:41,041
but that's only 'cause I've
read it so many times!

252
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:43,416
In the whole world,
it's my last possession.

253
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,125
It's such an honor to meet you!

254
00:10:45,208 --> 00:10:46,916
Was that all you
wanted to say to her?

255
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
[KISAKI]
Huh?

256
00:10:48,083 --> 00:10:50,666
[gasps]
Well, I don't want to be rude.

257
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,666
[JUNICHIRO] It's pretty much
a miracle you're both here.

258
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,750
Ask her.

00:10:55,416 --> 00:10:56,916
[MATOME]
I'm sorry, but...

261
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,208
Kisaki Sensei, can you please,
if you don't mind telling me,

262
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:02,291
I was wondering. How did your
first manga, Hanauta end?

263
00:11:02,375 --> 00:11:03,333
Huh?

264
00:11:03,916 --> 00:11:05,166
[SUZUNE]
Hanauta?

265
00:11:05,250 --> 00:11:06,791
Ah, the tragedy.

266
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,333
Kisaki's first manga never
ended because the magazine

267
00:11:09,416 --> 00:11:11,708
that was running it went
out of business suddenly.

268
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,791
wasn't sure, but I thought you
might have a storyboard

269
00:11:13,875 --> 00:11:15,416
or plot outline for the ending.

270
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,041
Got something like
that you'd show her?

271
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:17,750

[MATOME]
Wait! I'm sorry.

274
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:25,541
Ah... I can't believe I
asked so much of my hero.

275
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,291
She was so upset with me,
she literally had to run away.

276
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:30,291
There's no way she's angry.

Don't worry, ghost girl.

279
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:33,916
I wouldn't have
introduced you

280
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,583
if she was gonna get mad
over a question from a fan.

and even though I knew
it wouldn't be published,

288
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,625

00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:10,041
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm...

317
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,291
[MATOME]
How weird. I don't get it.

318
00:13:14,375 --> 00:13:16,916
Why can't I move on
to the afterlife?

319
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,583
[JUNICHIRO] That's because
although you're happy,

320
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,791
there's still something
you yearn to do.

321
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,166
[MATOME]
What?

322
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,041
[JUNICHIRO] Finally, it's time
to start the lesson.

323
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,458
Ghost 101. If a spirit can't
pass on to the next realm,

324
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,625
it's likely because they
have some sort of physical

325
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:32,958
attachment to this one!

326
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:34,875
The obvious culprit would
be this pile of manga,

327
00:13:34,958 --> 00:13:36,208
but when you think about it,

328
00:13:36,291 --> 00:13:38,166
that doesn't make a
whole lotta sense.

329
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:40,125
Why would you be
attached to what hurt you?

330
00:13:40,208 --> 00:13:41,166
[MATOME grunts]

331
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:44,083
[JUNICHIRO shouts]

332
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:47,083
What's he up to this time?

333
00:13:47,166 --> 00:13:49,333
--Big brother.
--Whoa.

334
00:13:49,416 --> 00:13:51,083
It has to be in here.

335
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:53,625
[gasps]

336
00:13:53,708 --> 00:13:55,708
You're not attached
to published manga.

337
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,250
And even if you were a fan,

338
00:13:57,333 --> 00:14:00,458
it's not Kisaki's manga that
was on your mind all this time,

339
00:14:00,541 --> 00:14:01,708
but your own!

340
00:14:01,791 --> 00:14:02,750
[gasps]

341
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,500
[MATOME]
Her book inspired me to draw.

342
00:14:13,583 --> 00:14:15,125
But when I sat down to do it,

343
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:17,666
a giant bookshelf
fell right on me!

344
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:19,041
That's how you died?

345
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,166
It sure is.

346
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:22,000
That's so sad.

347
00:14:22,083 --> 00:14:23,583
[JUNICHIRO]
But can't you draw?

348
00:14:23,666 --> 00:14:25,958
It seems like you're still
able to touch things.

349
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:27,708
You read manga.

350
00:14:27,791 --> 00:14:29,375
[MATOME]
It's hard to explain.

351
00:14:29,458 --> 00:14:35,333
Like, I can, but it's not easy.
This feels so heavy to me.

352
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:36,708
[grunts]

353
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:39,250
Just turning the pages is
like lifting dumb bells,

354
00:14:39,333 --> 00:14:41,416
but it's worth the effort.

355
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,041
I don't think I'd have the
strength for something

356
00:14:43,125 --> 00:14:44,916
as complicated as drawing.

357
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,708
Oh. That makes sense, sort of.

358
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:49,250
Hey, are you feeling ok?

359
00:14:49,333 --> 00:14:51,291
[JUNICHIRO]
Yeah, yeah, I'm totally fine.

360
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:56,333
Ah. I had one of these beginner
manga kits when I was little.

361
00:14:56,416 --> 00:14:58,916
Why don't you let Sensei
show you the ropes a bit?

362
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,041
Oh, could you please teach me?!

363
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,166
Didn't she just get done saying
she wouldn't be strong enough?

364
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:09,958
To use this kit,

365
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,625
you'll need to follow
my instructions carefully.

366
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,541
I'm ready!

367
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:15,041
There are no rules, ghost girl,

368
00:15:15,125 --> 00:15:16,916
you just pick up
a tool, and use it!

369
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,291
Do you understand?

370
00:15:18,375 --> 00:15:19,375
[STUDENTS]
Uh...

371
00:15:19,458 --> 00:15:21,583
Actually, that's kind
of confusing.

372
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:22,916
I mean, you need to, like,

373
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,083
learn how to use the
tools first, right?

374
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,791
That's just what they
want you to think

375
00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:28,666
so you'll buy their manuals!

376
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,375
If you want to draw, then you
have to just draw, ghost girl!

377
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:34,833
Uh... What if I can't?
I have no idea where to start.

378
00:15:34,916 --> 00:15:37,625
How do you even figure
out what you're gonna draw?

379
00:15:37,708 --> 00:15:39,333
[KISAKI]
Draw something interesting.

380
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:41,291
What amuses you?
What inspires you?

381
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,083
What do you often ponder?
That's all that really matters.

382
00:15:45,166 --> 00:15:47,416
It's how I started out
when I was a little girl.

383
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,458
I would go to the playground,
but I wouldn't play,

384
00:15:49,541 --> 00:15:51,583
I would just sketch in
the dirt all afternoon.

385
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,666

[gasps]

391
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,833
[KISAKI]
Although I was just having fun,

392
00:16:08,916 --> 00:16:11,583
I'd inadvertently made
someone else happy.

393
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:14,583
I realized that was the
meaning of true joy.

[gasps]

395

[KISAKI]
Ever since that day in the park,

396
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:20,000
I always draw from the heart.

[MATOME gasps]

I'll try again,
straight from the heart!

401
00:16:30,083 --> 00:16:32,916
In that case, It'd be my
honor to draw with you!

better than usual today!

was stealing her strength!

00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:37,833
I saw a shooting star.

472
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:40,375
I took the opportunity
to make lots of wishes.

473
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:44,333
I want a boyfriend, I want to
be smarter, I want to be cute.

474
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:45,875
Boom!

475
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:48,208
Unfortunately, it wasn't a star,
but a falling space station.

476
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,750
I was busy making all my
wishes instead of running away.

477
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:52,958
I died.

478
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,791
[JUNICHIRO]
To my surprise, however,

479
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:59,916
dying made my greatest
wish come true. It was...

480
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,416
It was...

481
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:04,666
...It was...

482
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:06,833
What was it?

483
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,833
Heh!

484
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,333
Excellent work, Ghost Girl!

485
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:13,333
From the first panel to
the last, it's just fantastic!

486
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:14,958
I can't wait to find out what--

487
00:20:15,041 --> 00:20:16,000
[gasps]

488
00:20:18,041 --> 00:20:20,666
[gasps]
What's happening?

489
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:23,291
This is just like
Kisaki Sensei said.

490
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:26,541
Sharing something from the
heart really is the best.

491
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:28,333
Hey, you're glowing
and fading away!

492
00:20:28,416 --> 00:20:29,916
You can't just leave
me hangin' like this!

493
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,833
This is only the first page,
where's the rest?

494
00:20:31,916 --> 00:20:34,458
[MATOME]
The first page was all I needed.

495
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,750
You helped me experience
this feeling of joy

496
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:39,666
just like my favorite author
in the whole world!

497
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,250
[MATOME]
Thank you.

498
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:44,291
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

499
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,041
And thanks for saying my manga
is good. I'm glad you liked it.

500
00:20:49,125 --> 00:20:50,083
[JUNICHIRO]
Wait a sec!

501
00:20:50,166 --> 00:20:51,625
I haven't concluded
today's lesson!

502
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,333
[MATOME]
Mr. Kagami,

503
00:20:53,416 --> 00:20:54,833
When we meet in our next lives,

504
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:57,916
I hope I can be one of
your students for real!

505
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,041
And promise me that we'll talk
about manga lots more, okay?

506
00:21:09,958 --> 00:21:11,500
[chuckles]

507
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,125
[SUZUNE grunts]
You okay?

508
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,916
[JUNICHIRO]
She's gone now.

509
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:22,583
[giggles]

510
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:25,750
[JUNICHIRO] Grinning like
an idiot... and an angel.

511
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:30,666
[KOYOMI]
Nishikujo.

512
00:21:30,750 --> 00:21:31,708
[KISAKI grunts]

513
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,583
She was Matome Nishikujo.

514
00:21:35,666 --> 00:21:37,958
I trust she made an
impression on you.

515
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:39,333
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm?

516
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:42,416
She was amusing and endearing
in her life as well.

517
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:45,833
[JUNICHIRO]
I bet.

518
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:47,291
I can't believe Matome's manga

519
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,666
got at my heart like that
with just one page.

520
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,916
She was an incredible author.

521
00:23:30,083 --> 00:23:31,916
[MATOME]
Hi, I'm Matome Nishikujo,

522
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,458
aka Ghost Girl!

523
00:23:33,541 --> 00:23:36,041
I met Kisaki Sensei,
drew my first manga,

524
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:38,333
and finally made my
way to the afterlife!

525
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:40,458
Whew! Talk about a busy day!

526
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:43,000
Next episode,
Kotaro Araki the truant

527
00:23:43,083 --> 00:23:44,958
is finally coming
to Icho Academy.

528
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,625
But the transition's not as
smooth as everyone had hoped.

529
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,333
Hey is he wearing
a girls' uniform?

530
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:53,125
Period seventeen,
"Turmoil on Day One"

531
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:56,708
Ha, ha. That looks like fun.
Maybe in my next life.
