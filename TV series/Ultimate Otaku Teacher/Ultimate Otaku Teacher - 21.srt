00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,250
Hey! Don't change that channel!

2
00:00:09,333 --> 00:00:11,833
You don't wanna miss
a second of this one!

3
00:00:12,708 --> 00:00:14,416
So it's all-out war, huh?

4
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:15,958
Fighting may not
be my strong point,

5
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:19,125
but I've got more than
enough tricks up my sleeve!

6
00:00:19,208 --> 00:00:21,083
All teachers are looking for
diamonds in the rough,

7
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:24,125
and I, Junichiro Kagami,
the Ultimate Otaku Teacher,

8
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,750
always find them first!

00:01:47,083 --> 00:01:49,250
[NARRATOR] Activating a
mysterious item left behind

10
00:01:49,333 --> 00:01:51,500
by their father,
five half-siblings

11
00:01:51,583 --> 00:01:54,583
now defend the earth from
the evil forces of Nemesis!

12
00:01:54,666 --> 00:01:55,916
They are...

13
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,000
[FAMILY RANGERS] Fraternal
Force Family Rangers!

14
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:24,958
[NARRATOR] Fearing that
her twin sister has

15
00:03:25,041 --> 00:03:27,625
succumbed to darkness,
pop idol Nagare Komiya

16
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:29,291
neglects her own sacred duty!

17
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,416
Thankfully, our hero,
Junichiro Kagami

18
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,958
is there to save the day.

19
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,541
Moved by his act of heroism,

20
00:03:34,625 --> 00:03:36,833
Nagare reveals
a most terrible secret.

21
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:39,625
Her sister Taki posed
as her at a key audition.

22
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,416
Having won her position
through deceit,

23
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:44,791
Nagare was convinced that Taki
was the more worthy performer.

24
00:03:44,875 --> 00:03:46,333
Our hero seeks to
prove her wrong,

25
00:03:46,416 --> 00:03:48,833
by throwing her into
a Family Ranger battle!

26
00:03:48,916 --> 00:03:53,291
Nagare performs admirably,
but is soon met with tragedy!

27
00:03:53,375 --> 00:03:55,875
[JUNICHIRO] She's taking
an awful long time to change.

28
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,750
Wonder what's up?

29
00:03:57,833 --> 00:04:00,708
[TAKI]
Hey! Sorry I'm late!

30
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:02,500
[JUNICHIRO] And now
the real deal shows up.

31
00:04:02,583 --> 00:04:04,625
Didn't expect her so soon.

32
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:06,583
How did the competition go?

33
00:04:06,666 --> 00:04:10,250
Hold on. Junichiro?
Why are you here?

34
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,000
Oh my gosh, you were
so cool up there, Taki!

35
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:14,250
Chiyo. Hey.

36
00:04:14,333 --> 00:04:16,291
I know that team meeting
was a big deal for you,

37
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:19,750
but I'm so glad you got out
early and defended our title!

38
00:04:19,833 --> 00:04:21,666
I felt the
Fraternal Fighting Force

39
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:23,375
in every note you sang!

40
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:27,125
What? Is that a joke?
I literally just got here.

41
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:28,166
Huh?

42
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:29,750
Uh, so Leader.

43
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:33,000
Changing the subject, what was
the big meeting about anyway?

44
00:04:33,083 --> 00:04:35,416
Oh, well remember
that dumb jerk

45
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,375
that was picking
a fight with you?

46
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,500
We heard rumors that
he was setting up a posse

47
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,416
to launch a surprise
attack on our gang,

48
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,000
so we wanted to be ready.

49
00:04:43,083 --> 00:04:45,666
Uh-oh. That's not good.

50
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:48,708
Wait. Would someone
tell me what's going on?

51
00:04:51,583 --> 00:04:53,333
Idol Sister!

52
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:02,875
[JUNICHIRO panting]

53
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,500
[NAGARE muffled yelling]

54
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,875
[JUNICHIRO] Oh no. What are
you doing? Let her go!

55
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,750
[grunts]
Can it!

56
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:24,291
Aah!

57
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:28,583
Let's move, people might see!
Adiós, old man.

58
00:05:28,666 --> 00:05:31,458
[JUNICHIRO]
Ow. That sucked.

59
00:05:31,541 --> 00:05:33,875
[TAKI]
Are you okay?

60
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,000
Nagare competed in
the sing-off instead of me

61
00:05:36,083 --> 00:05:37,666
and she just got kidnapped?

62
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:40,375
Uh-huh. If I'd known those
guys wanted to attack you,

63
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,791
I wouldn't have planned this.

64
00:05:41,875 --> 00:05:43,791
Either way, this is
out of our league.

65
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:45,958
We should contact the police!

66
00:05:46,041 --> 00:05:48,791
But if we do that,
it'll cause a huge scandal.

67
00:05:48,875 --> 00:05:50,416
Nagare just got
the lead in that show.

68
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,666
I can't blow it for her.

69
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,791
[JUNICHIRO] The police
won't get the pleasure.

70
00:05:54,875 --> 00:05:57,125
If those punks want to
act like criminal scum.

71
00:05:57,208 --> 00:05:59,208
I'll teach them
a lesson, myself.

72
00:05:59,291 --> 00:06:02,750
As far as they're
concerned, I am the law.

73
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:13,000
No, seriously,
thanks for kicking my ass

74
00:06:13,083 --> 00:06:14,916
the other day.
I really appreciate it.

75
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,541
That's why I'm definitely
making sure I pay you back.

76
00:06:18,625 --> 00:06:19,916
[MALE OTAKU 21A]
I think that's the car!

77
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,125
Oh hey, you're right!

78
00:06:21,208 --> 00:06:22,375
I hope she's inside!

79
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,625
[MALE OTAKU 21B]
Let's see.

80
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,166
[MALE OTAKU 21A] Whoa!
Aw man, it's really her!

81
00:06:26,250 --> 00:06:29,375
Guess that post was true!
Lady Nemesis and she's so cute!

82
00:06:29,458 --> 00:06:31,791
Uh. What the hell's
going on?

83
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,583
[JUNICHIRO chuckles]
That was too easy.

84
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,916
[TAKI]
I don't get it.

85
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,416
I started a rumor about
a cute Nemesis cosplayer

86
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:43,250
on the Family Rangers fan site.

87
00:06:43,333 --> 00:06:44,791
They really got into finding her

88
00:06:44,875 --> 00:06:47,125
and the news spread
all over the internet.

89
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,458
[TAKI] Wow, there're witnesses
all over the place.

90
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:54,875
You can't hide
from me, little punks.

91
00:06:54,958 --> 00:06:56,916
My surveillance network's
got a lock on you

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,041
like the eye of Sauron.

93
00:07:02,375 --> 00:07:03,750
[TAKI] You sure
this is the place?

94
00:07:03,833 --> 00:07:05,958
[JUNICHIRO] You can bet your
transformation belt on it.

95
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:09,166
Well, thank you. I think
I can handle things from here.

96
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:10,208
All alone?

97
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:12,083
It's my sister and my problem.

98
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,083
I can't put the other
members of Black Oracle Neo

99
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,041
in danger over this.

100
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:19,166
[JUNICHIRO] You won't
even tell Face Punch

101
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,416
or Cyborg about this?

102
00:07:25,583 --> 00:07:28,541
I know we used to be friends,
but that's in the past now.

103
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:32,208
They have their own lives.
Their own places to belong.

104
00:07:32,291 --> 00:07:35,458
They don't need to suffer
because of my mistakes anymore.

105
00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:43,666
I figured. Our leader
sure is a stubborn one.

106
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,708
[THUG 19A] Better play nice
for the camera.

107
00:07:46,791 --> 00:07:48,458
Once your little friends
get a load of you,

108
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:50,333
they'll come running
straight into our trap,

109
00:07:50,416 --> 00:07:52,916
thinking they're saving
their damsel in distress.

--[NAGARE] Wait!
--[THUG 19A] Huh?

I am the leader.
I'm the only one you need!

113
00:07:58,833 --> 00:08:00,250
You can do whatever
you want with me,

114
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,750
but leave them out of this!

Oh yeah? Nice.

116
00:08:06,208 --> 00:08:09,166
If you want me that bad,
then I can hardly say no.

Congratulations
on finding us, twerp.

Also, thanks for playing
the hero like a dumb ass

and delivering yourself
right to our doorstep

contribution we're going

If you're gonna keep
tossing out boomerangs,

you have to be ready when
they come flying back at you.

Consider that a free lesson.

[THUG 21B]
This is messed up!

253
00:13:55,666 --> 00:13:58,208
There's like,
hundreds of people out there!

254
00:13:58,291 --> 00:14:00,708
All of my friends
from Black Oracle Neo

255
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,458
and everyone from
the Family Rangers fan group.

256
00:14:03,541 --> 00:14:06,541
Whoa. Even the Rock Rangers
groupies are here.

257
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,916
I said this was a
reunion special, didn't I?

258
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
And when they do those,
it turns into a crossover

259
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,833
with the new rangers, too.

260
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,208
And spoiler alert,

261
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:18,125
the villains never
make it out on top.

262
00:14:18,208 --> 00:14:20,083
Anyway, since you guys
are a little slow

263
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,041
on the uptake, let me lay out
the scenario for you.

264
00:14:23,125 --> 00:14:26,041
The people outside think we're
having a friendly after-party.

265
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,458
In other words,
they don't know a thing

266
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:29,791
about your dastardly
deeds from earlier.

267
00:14:29,875 --> 00:14:30,916
[chuckles]

268
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,208
And if all those people
did find out,

269
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:35,166
what do you think
they'd do to you?

270
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:37,791
Mr. Toshihiko Takeda?

271
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,291
Hold up,
how do you know my name?

272
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,666
Not just you. I know all of
your friends names, too!

273
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,916
Like Yukito Date here,
Hitoshi Imagawa,

274
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:51,125
Hideyuki Konishi,
and Haruto Uesugi.

275
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:53,291
Also, this is
kind of villain 101,

276
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,875
but if you're going to
kidnap someone,

277
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:56,791
maybe don't use
your parent's car.

278
00:14:56,875 --> 00:14:58,500
Actually, just don't
kidnap anyone at all,

279
00:14:58,583 --> 00:14:59,833
because in this day and age,

280
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:02,291
it's easy to
look people up online.

281
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:04,166
Now, the next question.

282
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:07,250
Tell me, whose life is about
to become a living hell?

283
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,250
It's not mine.

284
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,291
[chuckles nervously]

285
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:19,625
We never got behind
this idea much, ourselves.

286
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,541
We sorta got
dragged into it, y'know?

287
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:24,250
[THUG 21B] Yeah, I'm like, uh,
actually glad you stopped him.

288
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:27,541
I mean, kidnapping?
Way not cool, right?

289
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:29,625
But hey, all's well
that ends well.

290
00:15:29,708 --> 00:15:31,416
Peer pressure is bad, yo.

291
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,416
[THUG 21C]
Later, Take.

292

[THUG 21B]
Yeah, it's getting late.

293
00:15:34,458 --> 00:15:35,916
Hey, get back here!

294

into this before!

you how to live your life,

296
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,916
but now might be a good time
to cut your losses

297
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,166
before things get really ugly.

298
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,875
Mr. Kagami, are you okay?

299

So funny thing,
we used to call Nagare

314
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,333
"The Dragon" back in the day.

315
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:36,458
And it's not just 'cause
the "Ryu" in "Komi-ryu"

316
00:16:36,541 --> 00:16:38,875
means "dragon." The truth is,

317
00:16:38,958 --> 00:16:41,375
if you lay a hand
on her sister, it awakens

318
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:44,791
a dragon's wrath within her
that will shake the heavens!

319
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,583
Hell no. Screw this.

320
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,458
I already lost
to one little girl.

321
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,916
That's more than enough!

322
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,083
Fraternal Strike!

323
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:57,541
Family Final Dragon Crush!

324
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:13,750
[MINAKO] Once the dragon
is unleashed,

325
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:17,416
her fury is so powerful,
not even Seijuro can stop her.

326
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:20,541
[MAN 21B] That was
a killer performance!

327
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:22,708
[MAN 21C]
It felt so real!

328
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:24,791
Huh? Ah!

329
00:17:28,250 --> 00:17:29,416
Are you kidding?

330
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:30,708
If she could've
done that all along,

331
00:17:30,791 --> 00:17:33,125
she didn't need us
to rescue her!

332
00:17:40,875 --> 00:17:44,750
[NAGARE] I guess the after-party
idea turned into a real thing.

333
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:47,333
[TAKI]
Yeah.

334
00:17:47,416 --> 00:17:49,875
--[NAGARE] Taki, um.
--[TAKI] Hmm?

335
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,583
Since we're here,
I wanted to talk to you

336
00:17:51,666 --> 00:17:53,750
about Black Oracle Neo.

337
00:17:53,833 --> 00:17:56,000
[TAKI]
Mm.

338
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:57,750
It's kind of awkward
to ask this,

339
00:17:57,833 --> 00:17:59,333
but do you think
I could join, too?

340
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:02,083
Huh? Uh, yeah.

341
00:18:02,166 --> 00:18:04,541
That would be fine
with me. I guess.

342
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,666
But I'm kinda confused here,
I thought you wanted me

343
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:08,875
to quit the whole gang thing.

344
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:12,958
[NAGARE] It's fine. I finally
know where both of us belong,

345
00:18:13,041 --> 00:18:15,958
and I'd like for that
to be together again.

346
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,125
[NAGARE]
Mr. Kagami!

347
00:18:20,208 --> 00:18:23,000
That's great, but now
I'm even more confused.

348
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,583
Oh yeah?
Seems clear to me that

349
00:18:24,666 --> 00:18:26,916
she received a lesson
from Mr. Kagami.

350
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,875
Okay, and that's a good thing?

351
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:31,708
Yep. It was
for me, at least.

352
00:18:31,791 --> 00:18:33,125
He really helped me
pull it together

353
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:35,041
after I disbanded the group.

354
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:37,416
And he wasn't even
my teacher at the time.

355
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:40,875
I know this might
sound cheesy,

356
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,875
but it's like he has
this weird gravity about him.

357
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,125
You made a ranger team...

358
00:18:45,208 --> 00:18:46,583
[MINAKO] He finds your
true self, hidden away

359
00:18:46,666 --> 00:18:48,041
and pulls it out
of your heart.

360
00:18:48,125 --> 00:18:49,833
It didn't seem like
it was your scene.

361
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,416
And you know
how these things go.

362
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,041
Five is the magic number
for teams on TV.

363
00:18:54,125 --> 00:18:55,833
Just the primary colors!

364
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:58,333
No, they added gold
and silver later!

365
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:00,208
Oh yeah, after
the halfway point

366
00:19:00,291 --> 00:19:01,833
they had support members, huh?

367
00:19:01,916 --> 00:19:06,333
I thought you were a fan!
That really didn't occur to you?

368
00:19:07,833 --> 00:19:09,833
Even if things
got a little messy here,

369
00:19:09,916 --> 00:19:11,833
everything is more fun
with friends.

370
00:19:11,916 --> 00:19:13,958
I don't know if the word
"friends" is appropriate

371
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:16,125
since it's more like Black
Oracle Neo and a bunch of

372
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:18,833
Family Rangers fans
kind of mashed together.

373
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:21,041
--Exactly.
--Huh?

374
00:19:21,125 --> 00:19:23,166
[MINAKO] We all took one of
Mr. Kagami's lessons,

375
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:24,750
so we're all friends now!

376
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:26,208
[TAKI gasps]

377
00:19:33,875 --> 00:19:36,041
Hey there, Leader.
You diggin' the party?

378
00:19:36,125 --> 00:19:38,875
Oh, uh, sure.

379
00:19:38,958 --> 00:19:42,791
But I was thinking.
Things should change.

380
00:19:42,875 --> 00:19:44,625
It's been long enough for me.

381
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:47,416
Maybe I should go
back to school next year.

382
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,958
[chuckles]

383
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,250
--Don't bother.
--Huh?

384
00:19:52,333 --> 00:19:54,250
The whole "streets
are my school" thing is like,

385
00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,666
half of your character!

386
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,625
If you give that way
of thinking up, what are you?

387
00:19:57,708 --> 00:19:59,750
We've got more than
enough schoolgirls!

388
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:01,416
Frankly, things are
a little crowded,

389
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:03,875
so it's getting harder
and harder to stand out.

390
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,166
And these students
aren't normal, by the way.

391
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,375
They're all over the top and
they're all fighting to maintain

392
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:11,916
their individuality in a cast
that's constantly expanding!

393
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,625
Just kidding.

394
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:18,625
You'll stand out on your own
just fine, wherever you go.

395
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,958
I'll be waiting to see you
in class, Leader.

396
00:20:21,041 --> 00:20:23,333
[giggles]
Count on it.

397
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:27,208
[NAGARE] Well, what
an interesting turn of events!

398
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,750
I suppose I'll just
have to apply for

399
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:30,375
Icho Academy next year!

400
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,083
Huh? For real?

401
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:33,875
I won't stop you
from doing what you want,

402
00:20:33,958 --> 00:20:35,208
but that certainly
doesn't mean

403
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,375
you get to do everything
I want without me.

404
00:20:37,458 --> 00:20:39,625
[TAKI] Whoa, wait.
What does that mean?

405
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:43,000
[JUNICHIRO] Fighting again? You
need another lesson already?

406
00:20:43,083 --> 00:20:44,541
[TAKI]
No, I'm fine.

407
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:47,000
[NAGARE] Good! Then it looks
like we'll be classmates soon!

408
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:49,125
[TAKI]
Come on!

409
00:20:51,916 --> 00:20:54,375
It was the biggest fart ever
and then just like magic...

410
00:20:54,458 --> 00:20:55,625
[JUNICHIRO]
Pardon me, gents.

411
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:58,166
What are you up to
this fine day?

412
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,541
Not goin' to school.

413
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,916
So get lost.

414
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,000
I'm not here as an educator.

415
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,291
Think of me as a headhunter
for Black Oracle Neo.

416
00:21:06,375 --> 00:21:07,833
Look, guys,
if you're gonna loiter,

417
00:21:07,916 --> 00:21:10,458
why not expand
your loitering horizons?

418
00:21:10,541 --> 00:21:12,166
Join a cool team
and you can pursue

419
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,833
the ultimate loitering
with some friends.

420
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,875
[MAKINA] Surely my ears
are deceiving me.

421
00:21:16,958 --> 00:21:18,083
[JUNICHIRO]
Uh oh.

422
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:20,000
[MAKINA]
Please tell me you are not

423
00:21:20,083 --> 00:21:21,708
recruiting for a gang!

424
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,083
Oh, why, hello there.

425
00:21:24,166 --> 00:21:26,625
You've got it all wrong.
I mean, how much did you hear?

426
00:21:26,708 --> 00:21:28,000
Can we talk this over?

427
00:21:28,083 --> 00:21:29,500
I'm through with talking!

428
00:21:29,583 --> 00:21:31,208
Now is the time for justice.

429
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:34,250
Swift and brutal
and aimed directly at you!

430
00:21:34,333 --> 00:21:36,708
Also, if you don't
take off those glasses...

431
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Please! Mercy!

432
00:21:38,750 --> 00:21:41,916
[MAKINA, JUNICHIRO
indistinctive yelling]

433
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:46,208
Next year. New school.
New friends.

434
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:49,416
Heh. Bring it on.

435
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:54,291
[TAKI] I'm not losing
to you, or anyone else!

436
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,333
[YAMATO]
A pleasure to meet you.

437
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:35,791
I'm Yamato Toune, a former
classmate of Junichiro's.

438
00:23:35,875 --> 00:23:37,750
In case you were wondering,
he's always been

439
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,041
an incurable Family Rangers fan.

440
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:42,666
Next episode,
we find out what Junichiro

441
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,208
really yearns to do.

442
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:46,916
Because I have a feeling it
isn't teaching at this school.

443
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:50,625
At least I hope not, because my
lab could really use his genius!

444
00:23:50,708 --> 00:23:53,625
Period twenty-two,
"Castle Junichiro."

445
00:23:53,708 --> 00:23:55,375
I think it's time
we finally finish that

446
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:57,291
Anywhere Door of yours.
