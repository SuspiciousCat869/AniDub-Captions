I have YD.

You say you've
never heard of it?

00:00:13,708 --> 00:00:17,875
What? I like wearing yukata
on dates? Or yummy dinners?

00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:20,541
Wrong! It's a
debilitating illness

5
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,666

what you yearn to do.

Mr. Kagami, please report

to the student council

I repeat. Mr. Kagami,
your presence

11
00:02:06,583 --> 00:02:09,750
is promptly required in
the student council room.

You are needed in the student

[MAKINA] Mr. Kagami!
Please stop wasting our time

16
00:02:22,291 --> 00:02:25,000
and get to the student
council room already!

Mr. Junichiro Kagami! Let's go!

[MAKINA groans;

You're my problem. Just one
of many, if you have to know.

23
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:44,291
You shouldn't be
reading manga in school.

Of course I didn't, you pleb.

28
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:57,208
"Classroom of the
Terminus" is literature!

29
00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,000
Even though it features
personified deities

30
00:02:59,083 --> 00:03:00,791
in a high-school
romantic comedy setting,

31
00:03:00,875 --> 00:03:03,125
and tackles heavy themes
such as history and religion,

32
00:03:03,208 --> 00:03:05,583
it never comes across as
preachy or heavy-handed!

33
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:07,375
It is a first-class
entertainment package

34
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,083
for casual readers and
hardcore manga fans alike!

And while, yes, there is
quite a bit of fan

37

I only read it for the plot
and ongoing narrative.

38
00:03:16,291 --> 00:03:20,125
So gross! Is that why you
were reading in private?

39

Don't answer that.

40
00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,958
This is a list of your
frequently absent students.

41
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:25,958
As their teacher, it's
your personal obligation

42
00:03:26,041 --> 00:03:27,166
to visit each of their homes

43
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:29,083
and convince them to
start attending school.

44
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:30,500
I refuse!

45
00:03:30,583 --> 00:03:33,083
Y'know, it's almost refreshing
how predictable you are.

46
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,666
"Classroom of the
Terminus" Volume Three

47
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:37,458
comes out tomorrow and I have
to go to Akihabara to buy it.

48
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:39,541
Or you could be responsible
and get it at a bookstore

49
00:03:39,625 --> 00:03:41,541
near one of their houses
while doing your job!

50
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:43,500
If I don't buy it at
Anumate in Akihabara,

51
00:03:43,583 --> 00:03:45,541
I won't be able to get tickets
for the autograph signing

with the author Kisaki Tenjoin!

53

You have got to be kidding me!

54
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:02,916
Ah, that was close! Any later,
they'd have run out of tickets!

Uh... Excuse me.
What are you counting?

57
00:04:12,666 --> 00:04:14,416
The number of copies
of the latest volume

58
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,208
of "Classroom of the Terminus"
sold in this store today.

59
00:04:17,291 --> 00:04:20,125
You're kidding me.
Like, since this morning?

60
00:04:20,208 --> 00:04:22,333
It's afternoon.
You've been here all day?

61
00:04:22,416 --> 00:04:24,416
How else am I supposed
to get a count?

62
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,625
318 copies have
been sold in this store,

63
00:04:26,708 --> 00:04:29,333
so that means 218
people bought it.

64
00:04:29,416 --> 00:04:33,708
Hold on. Shouldn't that mean
318 people bought copies?

65
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,041
Nope! 218's the right number.

66
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:40,500
As you can see, I bought
the first 100 myself!

67
00:04:41,541 --> 00:04:44,000
Whoa! Why would you
buy so many copies?

68
00:04:44,083 --> 00:04:45,750
That's obvious, isn't it?

69
00:04:45,833 --> 00:04:49,000
Because I am this manga series'
number-one fan by far.

70
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,416
I know it better than everybody.

71

all over the country.

have a purpose in life.

But I think you lost count,
'cause some guys

just left with copies.
What a waste of a day.

all your fault!

you did this to me!

possibly understand my feelings.

obviously limited by comparison.

I've read deeper
into this manga's themes

you could ever dream!

the manga to resort to stealing

all of this? She doesn't
look like a master thief.

she's a relative.

Either way, it's too big
of a coincidence. Hmm...

155
00:08:41,083 --> 00:08:42,625
Oh, well!

156
00:08:42,708 --> 00:08:47,583
[phone rings]

157
00:08:47,666 --> 00:08:49,500
Yes, hello?

158
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:52,250
What? Yeah, the preview
for the new manga series.

159
00:08:52,333 --> 00:08:54,791
It's due in three days.

160
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:58,250
What'd you say?
"A communication error"?

161
00:08:58,333 --> 00:09:00,416
Wait, tomorrow morning?

162
00:09:00,500 --> 00:09:01,791
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

163
00:09:01,875 --> 00:09:03,291
[KISAKI] No, that
won't be a problem.

164
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:04,708
It's eight pages, right?

165
00:09:04,791 --> 00:09:07,458
If I get started now,
it'll be a breeze.

166
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,916
[JUNICHIRO] Sounds like
you're in trouble.

167
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,041
Don't be ridiculous.
I'm Kisaki Tenjoin!

168
00:09:14,125 --> 00:09:15,750
With the right inspiration
making my blood boil,

169
00:09:15,833 --> 00:09:18,750
I can whip up eight
pages in no time!

170
00:09:18,833 --> 00:09:20,833
[JUNICHIRO] So we need
to find you motivation.

171
00:09:20,916 --> 00:09:23,125
What's the new series
supposed to be about?

172
00:09:23,208 --> 00:09:25,250
Oh, it's a forbidden love
story between a brother

173
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,000
and sister, like Athena
and Apollo's in "Terminus."

174
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:29,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Say what?

175
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:34,208
[SUZUNE]
Hello?

176
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:37,958
What's his deal? Making me
come out here so late...

177
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:41,583
He did say it was
important though.

178
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,708
Where the heck am I, anyway?

179
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,208
Hey! Bro!
What's the matter?

180
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,041
Sis, I... Wait, no.

181
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,291
That's wrong. You're not
actually my "sis," are you?

182
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:58,458
Huh?

183
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:02,916
We're not really
blood-related siblings.

184
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,833
I just found out.
I can't believe it myself.

185
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,375
[JUNICHIRO sighs]

186
00:10:12,458 --> 00:10:14,250
What are you saying?

187
00:10:19,875 --> 00:10:21,375
[JUNICHIRO]
I have to admit....

188
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,791
Now that we know,
I'm a little bit relieved.

189
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:28,041
Wait. I don't
understand. How...?

190
00:10:28,125 --> 00:10:29,666
[JUNICHIRO]
It's alright.

191
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:33,458
[SUZUNE] What's happening?
This doesn't make any sense.

192
00:10:33,541 --> 00:10:36,541
If we're not siblings,
then what are we?

193
00:10:36,625 --> 00:10:39,208
And why's he acting so weird?

194
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:41,833
Finally. We can...

195
00:10:41,916 --> 00:10:45,625
[SUZUNE] We can what?
Oh, god. My head is spinning.

196
00:10:45,708 --> 00:10:47,541
I feel so lost right now.

197
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:49,208
Cut! Great work!

198
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:52,041
[SUZUNE screams]

199
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:55,250
Is that enough material for you?
We could keep going.

200
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:58,166
Mm, no, no, that was
almost too hot to handle!

201
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,916
Now I just gotta draw
the whole thing up!

202
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,041
Wait. All that wasn't real?

203
00:11:04,125 --> 00:11:08,166
No! It was an act! We needed
to reference a natural reaction

204
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:11,541
for her next manga series.
It's quite an honor!

205
00:11:11,625 --> 00:11:14,916
So we really are
brother and sister...

206
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,166
We couldn't have done it
without you, sis!

207
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,333
[SUZUNE] Oh, we're
not done yet.

208
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:20,708
[JUNICHIRO shudders]

209
00:11:20,791 --> 00:11:24,500
[SUZUNE] My "natural reaction"
has only just begun!

210
00:11:24,583 --> 00:11:25,958
[SUZUNE yells]

211
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:27,083
[crashing and banging]

212
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:29,666
Wow. I had no idea
we human beings

213
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,916
could be so cruel
to one another!

214
00:11:33,875 --> 00:11:35,333
[SUZUNE sighs]

215
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:38,083
You know I would have helped
without the big show, right?

216
00:11:39,666 --> 00:11:43,083
How's your page coming
along, bro? Oh, wow!

217
00:11:43,166 --> 00:11:44,750
I've always hoped something
like this would happen,

218
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:45,958
so I've spent a lot of time

219
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,833
tracing my favorite
artists just in case.

220
00:11:48,916 --> 00:11:51,208
'Kay, Kisaki.
Done with background guys!

221
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,208
Mm hm. Next, get started
on environments.

222
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,916
I've got some reference
pics on my computer.

223
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,500
[JUNICHIRO]
Okely dokely!

224
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,500
[JUNICHIRO]
Alright, let's see. Hm?

225
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,416
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

226
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,208
[JUNICHIRO]
No way!

227
00:12:15,041 --> 00:12:17,291
[SUZUNE snores]

228
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:20,541
All finished!

229
00:12:20,625 --> 00:12:24,250
Yes! Yes! This'll definitely get
the readers' hearts pounding!

230
00:12:24,333 --> 00:12:27,666
Hot! And it's all due to you
and your sister's chemistry!

231
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:30,000
I cannot thank
you guys enough!

232
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:33,333
Hm. Hey.
I got a question.

233
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:34,375
[KISAKI]
What?

234
00:12:34,458 --> 00:12:37,166
Your name's
Sachiko Tanaka, right?

235
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,125
Maybe. Even if it is,
it's none of your business.

236
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:46,583
[JUNICHIRO]
Actually, it is my business.

237
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:49,791
I'm Sachiko's teacher.
Junichiro Kagami.

238
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:56,416
Whatever.
I'm not going to school.

239
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,166
All I care about
is making my manga

240
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:02,375
and having readers that enjoy
my work. That's my life.

241
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:04,125
Things like going to
class and making friends

242
00:13:04,208 --> 00:13:07,083
are distractions.
They just get in my way.

243
00:13:07,166 --> 00:13:09,125
If I have time for
those sorts of things,

244
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,833
I'd be better off
spending it on my manga.

245
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:15,833
[JUNICHIRO] I see.
Well, as your teacher,

246
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:19,208
it's my obligation to say
this about your decision.

247
00:13:21,083 --> 00:13:24,833
I'm proud of you! You've made
the right call! Keep it up!

248
00:13:24,916 --> 00:13:26,000
Huh...?

249
00:13:26,083 --> 00:13:27,666
Your life no longer
belongs to only you!

250
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:30,583
You share it will all the people
who have invested in your story!

251
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,541
You can forget about school,
but you can never forget

252
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:35,208
about your dedication
to your fans!

253
00:13:35,291 --> 00:13:36,291
Capiche?

254
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:38,500
Okay. I got it.

255
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:41,791
Ahh. Alright. Now I
don't have to worry

256
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,833
about "Classroom of the
Terminus" ending prematurely!

257
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:47,666
[KISAKI] I can't believe
this guy is my teacher.

258
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:53,916
[SUZUNE] Get home, get changed,
eat, get to school.

259
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,166
Man, I dunno if
I'm gonna have time.

260
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,458
You better make it. Tardiness
at Icho means more than just

261
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:02,458
a slap on the wrist.
It's a date with the devil!

262
00:14:02,541 --> 00:14:05,666
Oh. Speaking of
Sir Zechs. Great.

263
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,166
Hey! What's up, Satan?

264
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,166
[MAKINA] Well, good
morning to you, too, jerk.

265
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:11,041
Did you ever meet
with Sachiko Tanaka?

266
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,750
Or do I have to remind
you that her coming

267
00:14:12,833 --> 00:14:14,750
to school is your
responsibility?

268
00:14:14,833 --> 00:14:17,750
Maybe. Tell me, why is
she so important to you?

269
00:14:17,833 --> 00:14:20,583
[MAKINA] What? She's not.
It's just that she and I

270
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,375
were in the same class
in our first year here.

271
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,625
That is, until she started
going on about how important

272
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:29,125
her stupid manga was and stopped
coming to class altogether.

273
00:14:29,208 --> 00:14:31,791
She quit without ever
getting to know our school!

274
00:14:31,875 --> 00:14:33,416
There's no way I can
accept her dropping out

275
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:36,583
for something as trivial as
her silly little comic book!

276
00:14:36,666 --> 00:14:38,166
[JUNICHIRO]
Well, if that's how you feel,

277
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,166
have you ever gotten
to know her manga?

278
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:41,375
What?

279
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:44,000
Well... Never mind.
I'll take care of it.

280
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,208
All you want me to
do is get her back

281
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,750
to school by any means
necessary, right?

282
00:14:47,833 --> 00:14:50,541
[MAKINA] Yeah, whatever it
takes, as long as she's here.

283
00:14:52,541 --> 00:14:55,875
Hey, are you ready to go?
The bus is leaving.

284
00:14:55,958 --> 00:14:57,625
[JUNICHIRO] You'll have
to go ahead without me.

285
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,833
I have something I've
gotta handle first. Later.

286
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,958
Wait a second!
What about school?

287
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:04,625
[BUS DRIVER]
You getting on or what, lady?

288
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:08,250
[SUZUNE] Ah! Yes,
I'm coming, sorry!

289
00:15:08,333 --> 00:15:11,541
Okay. Time to start the lesson.

290
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,000
[JUNICHIRO] Counting your
sales numbers again?

291
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,791
Trying to catch 'em all?

292
00:15:20,875 --> 00:15:23,666
Heh! There's been
a change of plans,

293
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,208
so dust off your thinking cap.
You're going to school.

294
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:32,208
[STUDENT A]
We're so sorry! Forgive us!

295
00:15:32,291 --> 00:15:34,500
We'll never be late
again, we swear!

296
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:37,291
Déjà vu! I could
swear you both said

297
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,375
that exact same thing yesterday.

298
00:15:39,458 --> 00:15:42,125
With attitudes like that, you
don't belong in Icho Academy.

299
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,958
Have some dignity!

300
00:15:45,041 --> 00:15:46,125
[JUNICHIRO]
Our story begins

301
00:15:46,208 --> 00:15:47,791
with Student Council
Head Makina Momozono

302
00:15:47,875 --> 00:15:50,750
picking on students
who arrive late to class.

303
00:15:50,833 --> 00:15:52,541
[MAKINA gasps]

304
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,250
[MAKINA]
Sachiko, you're here!

305
00:15:55,333 --> 00:15:56,750
I don't believe it!

306
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,416
Oh! Believe it!

307
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,333
As fate would have it,
the next series she's doing

308
00:16:01,416 --> 00:16:04,041
is about a student council head.
She needs research,

309
00:16:04,125 --> 00:16:07,625
so I told her I knew just
the person for her to study.

310
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,833
What happened to what
you proclaimed earlier?

311
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,875
"Forget about school!"
and all that.

312
00:16:11,958 --> 00:16:14,958
Yeah. Things change.
Look, the only person trying

313
00:16:15,041 --> 00:16:17,791
to get you to go back to school
is the Twin-Tailed Weirdo.

314
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:21,458
Until she gives up, we're never
going to hear the end of it.

315
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:22,916
But if she comes to
think your attendance

316
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:24,750
is way more trouble
than it's worth...

317
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:27,666
Well, then she'll finally
leave you alone!

318
00:16:29,166 --> 00:16:31,583
Sounds like fun.

319
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,666
[JUNICHIRO] She's finally
here and ready to learn.

320
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:36,250
You did say,
"no matter what," right?

321
00:16:36,333 --> 00:16:38,250
Yeah, I guess so.

322
00:16:38,333 --> 00:16:41,541
I promise I'm going to study
really hard this time around.

323
00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,083
I'll know everything
about my favorite subject.

324
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,125
Can't say I'm surprised.

325
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:49,333
You haven't changed a
single bit over the last year.

326
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,541
[MAKINA]
Let her study me.

327
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:59,250
Even at her worst,
she can't disrupt class.

328
00:16:59,333 --> 00:17:01,541
[JUNICHIRO] Her notes are very
thorough. The level of detail

329
00:17:01,625 --> 00:17:05,041
she exhibits almost rivals
that of the textbook.

330
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:06,708
[MAKINA gasps]

331
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:16,208
[MAKINA sighs]

332
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,916
[KISAKI grunts]

333
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,916
[MAKINA gasps]

334
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,333
[MAKINA]
Go away!

335
00:17:23,791 --> 00:17:25,625
[MAKINA]
Home at last.

336
00:17:25,708 --> 00:17:29,458
Ah... That is not what
I was expecting today.

337
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,958
But I'll have some
privacy till tomorrow.

338
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:34,208
Hey! You're home!

339
00:17:34,291 --> 00:17:35,833
For the love of all things holy!

340
00:17:35,916 --> 00:17:37,625
What are you two
doing in my house?

341
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:41,125
Research! You didn't think we'd
stick to just school, did you?

342
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,416
That's right! There's no
point in doing the research

343
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:46,541
if we don't observe
your private life too!

344
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,333
[KISAKI snickers]

345
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,666
I'm gonna dig around
in your drawers!

346
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,333
Stop!

347
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,500
[KISAKI] What's a student
council head keep in her closet?

348
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,708
Do you really wear this stuff?

349
00:17:56,791 --> 00:17:58,750
Oh, my! Some more drawers!

350
00:17:58,833 --> 00:18:00,958
I wonder what I'll
find inside these.

351
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:03,000
[MAKINA shudders]

352
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:04,958
[MAKINA]
Alright! I get it!

353
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,666
[KISAKI chuckles]

354
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,291
You don't have to come to school
anymore, just leave me alone!

355
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,958
[MAKINA] I'll let you study
me as much as you want.

356
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:15,208
[KISAKI]
Huh...?

357
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,583
But once you're done...
you have to promise me

358
00:18:16,666 --> 00:18:19,500
you'll keep coming to school.

359
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:23,291
But why? Why do you care?

360
00:18:23,375 --> 00:18:27,375
It's my duty as head
of the student council.

361
00:18:27,458 --> 00:18:29,708
Well, that's definitely
one of the reasons.

362
00:18:29,791 --> 00:18:31,791
But I don't think
that's all of it.

363
00:18:34,291 --> 00:18:36,125
[KISAKI] Did you take
that from my computer?

364
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:39,333
Sachiko...
You kept it all this time?

365
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:42,166
No. I didn't really
keep it or anything.

366
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,416
I just never deleted
it from my computer

367
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:46,833
and forgot about it,
that's all.

368
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:50,750
I remember. We took this
at opening ceremonies.

369
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:54,625
All set, Mom! You ready?

370
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,666
Oh, hey. You and I are in the
same class this year, aren't we?

371
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,916
I'm Makina Momozono.

372
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,291
Sachiko Tanaka.

373
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,625
Great! Take a picture with me!

374
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:10,500
[MAKINA laughs]

375
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:14,916
[MAKINA] Getting into Icho
Academy was the happiest day

376
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,875
of my life. It meant everything
to me. But not to you.

377
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,375
I can't believe we
got into the school

378
00:19:20,458 --> 00:19:22,708
of our dreams--
isn't that fantastic?

379
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:24,750
I guess.

380
00:19:24,833 --> 00:19:27,625
[MAKINA] After that, I kept
trying to talk to you.

381
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:32,083
I wanted you to like the school,
to enjoy being there like I did.

382
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:35,583
I wanted us to be
friends. But then...

383
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:39,291
I really don't need this school.
I've got my manga to work on.

384
00:19:39,375 --> 00:19:41,500
[MAKINA] So you stopped
coming to class.

385
00:19:41,583 --> 00:19:43,708
And I couldn't change your mind.

386
00:19:45,541 --> 00:19:47,458
[KISAKI]
So what if I did?

387
00:19:47,541 --> 00:19:49,500
I decided to leave that
school because I realized

388
00:19:49,583 --> 00:19:51,291
what I wanted out of life
wasn't going to come

389
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:53,208
from sitting around
in class all day.

390
00:19:53,291 --> 00:19:57,500
I never asked for your opinion,
or to be your pet project!

391
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:00,416
Look, it's great that you love
your school so damn much.

392
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,791
But you don't need
to force that on me!

393
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:10,625
She does need to
force it on you.

394
00:20:10,708 --> 00:20:14,583
Hey! What's up? I thought you
were on my side with this!

395
00:20:14,666 --> 00:20:16,125
Imposing your
hobbies and interests

396
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,000
on people who don't
care at all...

397
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,875
That just happens to be the M.O.
of your everyday otaku.

398
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:23,083
Please don't imply
I'm an otaku.

399
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:25,791
I'm doing my duty as
student council head.

400
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:28,416
That means... if Sachiko says
the school can't help her

401
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:32,041
in the things she wants to do,
then it's my responsibility

402
00:20:32,125 --> 00:20:35,208
to make the school accommodate
her dreams and passions.

403
00:20:35,291 --> 00:20:37,750
That's all I want for you.

404
00:20:40,875 --> 00:20:43,458
Hm. Twin-Tailed Weirdo,
you are the very definition

405
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:46,583
of an otaku when it
comes to Icho Academy.

406
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,125
[MAKINA gasps]

407
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,833
Lesson concluded.
Good job, me.

408
00:21:05,958 --> 00:21:08,500
[JUNICHIRO] What the
heck is going on?

409
00:21:08,583 --> 00:21:09,708
I thought you'd
be all finished

410
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:12,125
with your research
after yesterday.

411
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,541
Something occurred to me.
I don't know what Makina

412
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:17,500
has done to improve Icho Academy
in the time I've been away.

413
00:21:17,583 --> 00:21:19,458
Which then brought
on an epiphany.

414
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,416
The only way she'll
realize it's useless

415
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:24,458
is if I prove it to her
over and over again.

416
00:21:24,541 --> 00:21:27,708
Similarly, I know nothing about
the author Kisaki Tenjoin.

417
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,375
If her works really
are that important,

418
00:21:29,458 --> 00:21:31,458
I want to find out
why for myself.

419
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:33,875
I'm going to let her draw
in school. It's the only way

420
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,791
I'll ever be able to learn
anything about her and her work.

421
00:21:36,875 --> 00:21:39,666
Then I'll prove once and for all
that her manga's stupid.

422
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:42,041
It's an epic battle between
my love of manga...

423
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,791
And my love for
Icho Academy!

424
00:21:44,875 --> 00:21:46,916
And since you got us
into this mess...

425
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,625
You're gonna be our judge
to decide the winner!

426
00:21:49,708 --> 00:21:51,708
[JUNICHIRO stammers]

427
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:55,791
Game over, man!

428
00:23:30,625 --> 00:23:33,833
[KISAKI] This is Sachiko Tanaka,
better known as Kisaki Tenjoin.

429
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,291
I may be back in school,
but nothing is gonna stand

430
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,333
between me and my creative work!

431
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:41,583
In the next episode, our class
takes a virtual field trip

432
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,416
with an online game.
Once inside, we receive

433
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,208
special training from
the Ironclad Nun, Luce.

434
00:23:47,291 --> 00:23:50,083
Period 9, "The Girl
in the Game."

435
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:51,708
I guess I'm not the
only one who wanted

436
00:23:51,791 --> 00:23:54,291
to skip school, because
we've got another truant.

437
00:23:54,375 --> 00:23:57,166
Don't we need this guy to meet
the minimum team size?
