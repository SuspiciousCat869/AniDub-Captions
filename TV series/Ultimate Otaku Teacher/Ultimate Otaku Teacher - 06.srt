Hey, slave!

321
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,583
You tried to cheat me out of the
win and now you're gonna pay

322
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,583
for the rest of
your miserable, otaku life.

Hey smartass. I wasn't
making a damn joke.

If you don't wipe that
smile off your face,

Huh?

330
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,625
That was like a
dream come true!

Thanks for helping us put
those guys in their place!

You were super
awesome back there!

333
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,458
[YUI] Mr.Kagami told us
we could beat them easy

334
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:43,208
with a little help from you.
Jeez, he wasn't kidding!

Huh?

00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,541
Run that by me again?

337
00:15:46,625 --> 00:15:48,500
I guess it was supposed
to be a surprise,

338
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,500
but he said you'd be
really great at soccer

339
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,500
and he needed our help
to set up a game for you.

340
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:55,375
He was really going
out on a limb to help

341
00:15:55,458 --> 00:15:58,708
and it sounded like fun,
so I thought "why not?"

342
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,125
Wait a sec!

343

I saw her at work the other day,
talking to Mr. Kagami!

a real show! And trust me.

You won't want to
miss these shots!

Oh, I'll be watching closely.

I'm so happy to hear that.

[KIRIKO]
Then that means.

It's no contest who's gonna
win this thing but I promise,

350
00:16:17,083 --> 00:16:18,083
it will blow your mind!

He wasn't bragging.

He was just talking
about Seijuro.

Hey! You gonna
explain this, or what?

Seijuro!

Dude, that was crazy cool!

Even though you dominated us,

00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:34,625
that was the most fun
I've had in a while!

but it was awesome!

be our new star player!

We thought you were in on it.

367
00:16:48,833 --> 00:16:50,250
Mr. Kagami said he
was gonna show us

368
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:52,500
a player straight
out of a video game.

All we had to do
was play a match.

371

of it at first, so I said no.

372
00:17:01,250 --> 00:17:02,791
[KAKITANI] But then he
waited outside my house

all night with these
sad puppy eyes.

see something crazy.

[SEIJURO grunting]

475
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,833
All in a day's
work for you, huh?

476
00:21:25,916 --> 00:21:28,291
[JUNICHIRO] So you say,
but I was dancing to

477
00:21:28,375 --> 00:21:31,416
your tune the entire time,
wasn't I?

478
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,291
Well?

479
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:34,625
Were you sufficiently amused?

480
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,000
Yes. Quite thoroughly.

481

482
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:40,416
[MINAKO] I'll choke some
common sense into you!

483
00:21:42,333 --> 00:21:43,833
[chuckles]

484
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:46,541
[KOYOMI] I knew inviting
you here was a good idea.

485
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:49,875
Let us hope this is only the
beginning of a long career.

486

[SEIJURO grunts]

487
00:21:51,208 --> 00:21:52,541
[MINAKO] I hope you like
sleeper holds, buddy,

488
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,458
'cause I can keep
this up all day!

489

[SUZUNE]
Suzune here!

491
00:23:32,208 --> 00:23:34,250
You didn't forget me, did you?
I'm the adorable little sister!

492
00:23:34,333 --> 00:23:38,458
Anyway, Seijuro's on our side
now, so life's 100% less scary!

493
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:41,041
The next problem
student is Kanan Chinami.

494
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:42,500
She's the prettiest
girl in the school,

495
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:43,708
but nobody's ever
heard her voice

496
00:23:43,791 --> 00:23:45,875
'cause she only talks
with text messages!

497
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:47,958
Is that bonkers or what?

498
00:23:48,041 --> 00:23:50,250
Period seven,
"A Beautiful Girl's Secret."

499
00:23:50,333 --> 00:23:52,250
I heard a rumor that
she actually sounds

500
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,166
just like an anime character!

501
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,416
Uh-oh!

502
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,375
You better not make her
say anything weird, bro!
