00:00:09,708 --> 00:00:11,791
[JUNICHIRO]
I have YD.

2
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,583
You've never heard of it?

3
00:00:13,666 --> 00:00:14,500
What?

4
00:00:14,583 --> 00:00:16,000
I like wearing
yukata on dates?

5
00:00:16,083 --> 00:00:17,875
Or yummy dinners?

6
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:18,875
Wrong!

7
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,541
It's a debilitating illness.

8
00:00:20,625 --> 00:00:23,458
where you can only do
what you yearn to do.

9
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm the chairperson
of Hiiragi Academy,

10
00:00:26,083 --> 00:00:27,791
Koyomi Hiiragi,

11
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:30,708
And I am here today
to recruit you.

12
00:00:30,791 --> 00:00:32,625
[JUNICHIRO] Not taking no
for an answer is one thing,

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,875
but trying to best me in
Akihabara of all places,

14
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,000
is like an attack on titan.

15
00:00:37,083 --> 00:00:38,541
[KIRIKO screams]

16
00:00:38,625 --> 00:00:39,583
[gasps]

17
00:00:41,541 --> 00:00:42,666
[JUNICHIRO]
You're not expelled,

18
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,333
no matter what this
twin-tailed weirdo says.

19
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,000
Prepare to be schooled.

20
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:25,833
[MAKINA] "Maid dignity"
are you serious?

21
00:02:25,916 --> 00:02:28,833
[JUNICHIRO] Of course!
This is her way of life.

22
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:32,583
Until you understand that,
you have no right to expel her.

23
00:02:32,666 --> 00:02:35,333
[MAKINA scoffs]
The modern concept of a maid

24
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:37,208
began in the 19th century.

25
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:40,000
Domestic service was the second
largest source of employment

26
00:02:40,083 --> 00:02:42,833
in Victorian England, where they
served as symbols of wealth.

27
00:02:42,916 --> 00:02:44,750
There were about
17 types of maids,

28
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:47,458
ranging from Housekeepers
to Step Girls.

29
00:02:47,541 --> 00:02:48,875
The so called "maids"

30
00:02:48,958 --> 00:02:51,833
at these cafes you like so
much are just fetish bait.

31
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:54,166
They have precious little
to do with the originals.

32
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,250
I figured you'd say that.

33
00:02:56,333 --> 00:02:58,166
Sorry, but you're way off.

34
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,166
Well. If you're so smart,
then please. Explain it to me.

35
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,875
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm. Are you sure?

36
00:03:03,958 --> 00:03:05,041
[gasps]

37
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,625
You realize you're
agreeing to a battle.

38
00:03:07,708 --> 00:03:09,291
If I can teach you about maids,

39
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:10,875
then you have to
admit I'm a teacher.

40
00:03:10,958 --> 00:03:12,166
[gasps]

41
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:15,041
The philosophy of this
school is to learn,

42
00:03:15,125 --> 00:03:17,000
think, and devise
your own answers.

43
00:03:17,083 --> 00:03:18,333
Only then can your spirit

44
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:20,875
experience true
richness and growth.

45
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:23,083
Maids have no dignity, okay?

46
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:25,583
At least the trashy ones
you're talking about don't!

47
00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:28,250
Working that kind of job is
against our schools' principles,

48
00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:31,125
and I don't need you, of all
people, to teach me that!

49
00:03:33,541 --> 00:03:34,625
[KIRIKO gasps]

50
00:03:34,708 --> 00:03:36,291
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm.

51
00:03:36,375 --> 00:03:37,083
[KOYOMI]
Are you certain?

52
00:03:37,166 --> 00:03:39,166
[gasps]

53
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,708
You can make that
bold assessment

54
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,708
without even seeing the cafe?

55
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:44,000
You're that sure?

56
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:46,750
Well, it's obvious.

57
00:03:46,833 --> 00:03:47,958
Oh, is it?

58
00:03:48,041 --> 00:03:49,750
[sighs]

00:03:49,833 --> 00:03:52,375
Good. Then let's go.

Welcome home, master.

Okay, off to work for me.

The manager?

That little girl?

72
00:04:20,291 --> 00:04:21,541
You've been here before?

73
00:04:21,625 --> 00:04:23,375
And so often she knows you?

74
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,500
[gasps]
Once or twice.

75

Kagamin is our number one
platinum VIP customer!

He set a record by visiting
50 times in one month!

Why, in fact, he was
just here this morning!

your addiction to maids, huh?

Uh, no!

[JUNICHIRO]
Anyway, back on topic.

Yes, as I was trying to say,
this is the manager of

"Heart on Heart" Maid Café.

She looks young, but she
graduated with me,

92

then took a trip to England
to study the history of maids.

are out of the way,

I actually have a favor to ask.

Uh-huh?

over there work as one of
your maids for the day?

[JUNICHIRO]
It's the only way to learn.

106
00:05:27,666 --> 00:05:30,791
You have to experience the true
dignity of a maid firsthand.

more than happy to join you.

do with maids, anyway?

165
00:07:44,125 --> 00:07:46,541
Moe moe kyun!

166
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:49,291
I am not engaging
in that nonsense.

167
00:07:49,375 --> 00:07:51,750
Fine. So you're a crappy maid.

168
00:07:51,833 --> 00:07:53,250
But I hope you're
proud of yourself,

169
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:54,583
expelling an awesome student

170
00:07:54,666 --> 00:07:57,541
who can do something you
can't even dream of doing.

171
00:07:57,625 --> 00:07:59,041
[gasps]

172
00:07:59,125 --> 00:08:00,500
You're boring.

173
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:02,708
Totally one-dimensional.

174
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,708
It's a shame, too, since Options
is an interesting character,

175
00:08:05,791 --> 00:08:08,041
but her arc won't last two
episodes with a sidekick

176
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,791
like you dragging her down.

177
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:13,000
[MAKINA]
Stop right there.

178

[JUNICHIRO]
Hm?

179
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,916
[MAKINA] I was just taking
a break, that's all.

180
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,916
Makina Momozono
doesn't quit that easily.

181
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:23,291
[MAKINA]
Now excuse me.

182
00:08:23,375 --> 00:08:26,125
All fired up. I like it.

183
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:27,625
Guess she's ready.

184
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,666
Catchphrase time.

185
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,333
Okay, time to
start the lesson.

186
00:08:38,625 --> 00:08:39,583
[PATRON B chuckles]

188
00:08:41,416 --> 00:08:43,250
[PATRON B]
See ya later, girls.

189
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:45,583
[KIRIKO giggles]
You don't have to be so tense!

190
00:08:45,666 --> 00:08:46,958
Have fun with it.

191
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:48,333
[MAKINA]
Uh?

192
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,625
As long as the master or
mistress enjoy themselves,

193
00:08:50,708 --> 00:08:52,583
we can do whatever we want!

194
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:55,041
There are no rules here,
so get creative!

195
00:08:55,125 --> 00:08:57,291
[MAKINA]
Uh... Huh.

196
00:09:00,875 --> 00:09:02,375
[MAKINA]
Sorry to keep you waiting.

197

[PATRON C]
Look at that, a rice omelet!

Isn't that your

Mmhmm, yeah!

201
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:12,333
[gasps] Just a moment please,
young master. Here.

202

00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,041
My pleasure, master.

207

[BOY A]
That's so cool.

208
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:26,125
I almost don't wanna eat it now!

209
00:09:26,208 --> 00:09:27,500
I'm glad you like it.

210
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:29,166
I'm happy to serve.

211
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:33,791
Yeah, yeah.

212
00:09:33,875 --> 00:09:35,458
You learned one little trick.

213
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:38,000
Don't act like you're a pro
all of a sudden, okay?

214
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,083
I wasn't thinking that.

215
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:43,125
[JUNICHIRO] The "name on the
omelet" thing is like, Maid 101.

216
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:44,375
[MAKINA gasps]

217
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:45,958
[JUNICHIRO] My sister's
leveled up to pictures.

218
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,041
[BOYS laugh]

[MAKINA whines]

220
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,708
Now, watch a real pro at work.

221
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,000
[gasps]

222
00:09:51,083 --> 00:09:53,500
[KIRIKO giggles]

223
00:09:53,583 --> 00:09:54,625
All done!

224
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:56,583
You wanted something
like this, right?

225
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,750
[PATRON D gasps]

226
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,000
Perfect! It's art!

00:10:02,083 --> 00:10:02,791
[growls]

228
00:10:02,875 --> 00:10:04,708
And that's not all.

229
00:10:04,791 --> 00:10:07,708
Every master and every mistress
has their own demands.

230
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,291
Their own little quirks

231
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:12,083
and their own secret key
to unlock their smile.

232
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,000
You have to understand them
before you can make them happy.

233
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,208
Are you kidding?

234
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:17,625
Just look for yourself.

235
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:18,666
[MAKINA gasps]

236
00:10:22,208 --> 00:10:25,125
I'd like... some orange juice.

237
00:10:25,208 --> 00:10:27,375
Huh? For real?

238
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,750
I-I mean it doesn't have to
be orange juice, I guess.

239
00:10:30,833 --> 00:10:32,833
[MINAMI huffs]
Whatever.

240
00:10:32,916 --> 00:10:34,583
Can... I get a cup?

241
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,208
Uh, if you're gonna
be picky. Fine.

242
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,666
Huh? I'm supposed
to drink with this?

243
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:42,708
You've got some attitude!

244
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,666
Here!

245
00:10:44,750 --> 00:10:47,125
I guess I'll have to learn
to deal with this somehow.

246
00:10:47,208 --> 00:10:49,333
That's gotta be the
worst service ever.

247
00:10:49,416 --> 00:10:50,541
You're wrong.

248
00:10:50,625 --> 00:10:51,416
Look again.

249
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,208
[MAKINA]
Huh?

250
00:10:53,291 --> 00:10:55,833
[JUNICHIRO] That customer of
hers has never been happier.

251
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:56,833
[gasps]

252
00:10:56,916 --> 00:10:58,250
That's right.

253
00:10:58,333 --> 00:11:00,333
The manager takes one look
at her master or mistress

254
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,375
and knows exactly
what they want,

255
00:11:02,458 --> 00:11:05,083
even if it seems ridiculous
on the surface.

256
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,708
I'm sorry, but uh, do you think

257
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,791
you could cast a
little spell for me?

258
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,458
Oh, yeah, the magic thing.

259
00:11:11,541 --> 00:11:12,916
I totally forgot.

Nummy yummy! There, I'm done.

[gasps] So cruel, yet,
I can't get enough!

262
00:11:20,666 --> 00:11:22,875
[JUNICHIRO] This is the
work of a true master.

263
00:11:22,958 --> 00:11:27,041
Sometimes she's a little sassy.
Sometimes she's a little clumsy.

264
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:29,041
Sometimes she's a little sister.

265
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:31,625
Yes, even at her age.
Don't question it.

266
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,750
She reaches into her
customer's hearts, and,

267
00:11:33,833 --> 00:11:35,166
if only for a moment,

268
00:11:35,250 --> 00:11:37,416
becomes the character
they most treasure.

[MAKINA gasps]

270
00:11:38,958 --> 00:11:41,791
The way of the maid is not
for the faint of heart.

271
00:11:41,875 --> 00:11:44,000
Well, what do
you think now?

272
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:45,958
Can you aspire to that
level of greatness,

273
00:11:46,041 --> 00:11:48,083

Uh-huh.

So, Twin-Tailed Weirdo,

how does a hard day's work feel?

292
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,458
Time for your test.

293
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:28,166
Do you know what
maid dignity means?

294
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:30,166
Let's see.

295
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:32,333
Having the creativity
and confidence

296
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,166
to think out of the box,

297
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:36,958
the compassion to understand
what the customer needs,

298
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:40,666
and the cleverness to adapt
and deliver that to them.

Hm.

[JUNICHIRO]
I give you half credit.

301
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:48,750
Well, it's a start, but I think
you already know the other half.

[gasps]

303
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:51,333
That's right.

304
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:52,916
And as I heard you say before,

305
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,291
the philosophy of your
school is to learn, think,

306
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,541
and devise your own answers,

307
00:12:56,625 --> 00:12:58,083
so that your spirit
may experience

308
00:12:58,166 --> 00:13:00,916
true richness and growth.
Isn't that correct?

309
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,916
So what's your point?

310
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,625
Why do you want to expel

[gasps]

312
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:09,791
And don't feed me some line a
one episode villain would say,

313
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:13,208
like "because she's breaking
the rules." I want the truth.

314

[ALL gasp]

Even if you have a lofty
opinion of maid cafes,

320
00:13:25,958 --> 00:13:29,541
that doesn't change the
reality of the situation.

321
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,291
The fact remains
that places like this

322
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,583
are looked down upon by society.

486
00:20:31,208 --> 00:20:34,833
[singing continues]

487
00:20:34,916 --> 00:20:36,291
Awesome!

488
00:20:36,375 --> 00:20:38,333
[BODYGUARD]
They're at 10 million views.

489
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:41,375
Makina. Just so you're aware.

490
00:20:41,458 --> 00:20:43,291
They're streaming this
performance live

491
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:45,458
and over 10 million people
from around the world

492
00:20:45,541 --> 00:20:47,208
are watching it as we speak.

493
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,625
10 million?

494
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:51,041
It's quite the
ironic twist, isn't it?

495
00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:52,750
Now if you were to expel her,

496
00:20:52,833 --> 00:20:54,833
it's more likely to hurt
the school's image.

497
00:20:54,916 --> 00:20:55,875
[gasps]

498
00:20:56,833 --> 00:20:58,916
[MAKINA]
I don't understand.

499
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,333
I mean, why did
you take her side

500
00:21:01,416 --> 00:21:04,125
when I just wanted what
was best for the school?

501
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,333
It's not like that.

502
00:21:05,416 --> 00:21:06,583
[gasps]

503
00:21:06,666 --> 00:21:10,583
[laughs] I wasn't siding
with her or against you.

504
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:13,208
But I will always side with
what is most amusing,

505
00:21:13,291 --> 00:21:15,958
and in this case, Mr.Kagami
was able to bring out

506
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:18,083
something truly
interesting in her.

507
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:19,583
In time, perhaps he can make

508
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:22,041
this entire nation
shine as well.

509
00:21:23,416 --> 00:21:27,166
And I'll be there
aiding his every step.

510
00:21:27,250 --> 00:21:28,666
[MAKINA gasps]

511
00:21:28,750 --> 00:21:33,708
[singing continues]

512
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:44,250
And that concludes
another lesson!

513
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,500
Thanks, you guys!

514
00:21:45,583 --> 00:21:50,541
[CROWD cheers]

515
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,916
[KIRIKO]
Hi, Kiriko Shikishima here,

516
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:35,833
AKA Potatoes! I hope
you liked my song!

517
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,666
Also, your order of fries
is coming right up!

518
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:41,625
In the meantime,
next episode, Mr. Kagami

519
00:23:41,708 --> 00:23:44,291
has to face off against the
baddest dude in the school,

520
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,125
Seijuro Nanami!

521
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:49,458
Period Five,
"Monster of Icho Academy."

522
00:23:49,541 --> 00:23:50,791
It looks bad for our hero,

523
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,416
but I know just the
person to save the day!

524
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,625
Wait.

525
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:56,708
She was one of
Mr. Kagami's students, too?
