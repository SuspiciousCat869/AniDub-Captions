[JUNICHIRO]
I have YD.

2
00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,541
You say you've
never heard of it?

3
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:14,791
What?

4
00:00:14,875 --> 00:00:18,333
I like wearing yukata on
dates? Or yummy dinners?

5
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:19,708
Wrong!

6
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,666
It's a debilitating illness
where you can only do

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:23,625
what you yearn to do.

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:27,541
I woke up with a revelation.
You need The History of Warfare!

9
00:00:27,625 --> 00:00:31,000
You are now part of
Japan's most popular MMO.

10
00:00:31,083 --> 00:00:32,958
There's a Mega Event
called "Battle of Uro."

11
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,708
I'll be the General,
you'll be my army

12
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:37,541
and everything that stands
in our way will be dead!

13
00:00:37,625 --> 00:00:40,625
Guys, I'd like to introduce
you all to my partner.

14
00:00:40,708 --> 00:00:41,958
I'm missing a student.

15
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:44,458
There is still another
truant, remember?

16
00:00:44,541 --> 00:00:46,416
I wasn't the only
student in your class

17
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,250
that had an attendance problem.

18
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:26,375
You've gotta be kidding me.

19
00:02:26,458 --> 00:02:28,708
Is it really you?

20
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:30,583
I mean, what are the odds?

21
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,916
The truant Koutaro and Luce
are the same person.

22
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,791
Um... Are you trolling me?
You can't be my teacher.

23
00:02:37,875 --> 00:02:40,291
Okay, wow.

24
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:44,625
[LUCE] How is it, of all people,
The First found me out?

25
00:02:44,708 --> 00:02:47,708
[JUNICHIRO] This is not how
things were supposed to go!

26
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:49,291
Damn!

27
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:51,291
You were supposed to be our last
team member in the battle event!

28
00:02:51,375 --> 00:02:53,166
Where am I supposed
to find another player

29
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,166
on such short notice?!

30
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:56,625
Uh. Wait, what?

31
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:58,166
Oh man! I'm really
gonna have to think

32
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:00,208
--outside of the box this time!
--You're not mad?

33
00:03:00,291 --> 00:03:02,000
I guess I do have
something to say to you

34
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:03,291
now that I know who you are.

35
00:03:03,375 --> 00:03:04,291
[gasps]

36
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:05,666
I gotta take care
of this crisis,

37
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:08,500
so training the team is
your responsibility now!

38
00:03:08,583 --> 00:03:09,541
[gasps]

39
00:03:13,166 --> 00:03:14,541
[SUZUNE]
Luce?

40
00:03:14,625 --> 00:03:17,125
Are you in there?
What happened to you?

41
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:20,166
[gasps] Oh.
Sorry about that.

42
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:22,458
I stepped away from my computer.

43
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:23,958
It's no big deal.

44
00:03:24,041 --> 00:03:26,958
Then why were you freaking out
when she wasn't answering?

45
00:03:27,041 --> 00:03:32,500
[LUCE] So I guess this means...
these kids are my... classmates.

46
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:35,625
[JUNICHIRO]
C'mon brain.

47
00:03:35,708 --> 00:03:39,333
Everyone's counting on me, I
have to find someone to join us.

48
00:03:39,416 --> 00:03:41,916
Oh... Now that
I think about it,

49
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,291
there's really only
one choice, isn't there?

50
00:03:45,583 --> 00:03:47,750
[SEIJURO bellows]

51
00:03:50,666 --> 00:03:51,833

[SEIJURO gasps]

Behold, Fairy Binding.

[SEIJURO grunts]

56
00:04:04,708 --> 00:04:08,625
[SEIJURO] And I thought losing
to Otaku Teacher was bad.

57
00:04:08,708 --> 00:04:11,208
[SUZUNE]
That was amazing, Luce!

58
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,958
Yeah, can you show us
how you did that?

59
00:04:13,041 --> 00:04:14,666
Because I've never
seen anything like it!

60
00:04:14,750 --> 00:04:16,166
[KANAN]
Uh-huh, uh-huh!

61
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:18,125
I baited the enemy
into charging at me

62
00:04:18,208 --> 00:04:20,166
and then evaded his attacks,
which allowed me to build

63
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:22,166
my Skill Gauge without
taking any damage.

64
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,625
[KANAN]
Build your what?

65
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,916
The Skill Gauge meter, it
measures the energy you have

66
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,291
to be able to perform
Super Special Attacks.

67
00:04:28,375 --> 00:04:30,500
You can see it in the top
left corner of your screen.

68
00:04:30,583 --> 00:04:31,416
Oh, that thing.

69
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,875
Now I see it.

70
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,500
The bar fills up
as you land hits,

71
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:35,875
or take them from your opponent.

72
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,916
You'll want to watch it,
so you know when it's full.

73
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,375
'Cause then you can do one of
those Super Special attacks

74
00:04:40,458 --> 00:04:41,791
to get you out of
a pinch or inflict

75
00:04:41,875 --> 00:04:43,041
a whole bunch of damage.

76
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:44,750
Yeah, now you're getting it!

77
00:04:44,833 --> 00:04:46,916
Man, you are so cool!
Which makes sense;

78
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,875
It takes a special person to put
up with my brother all the time.

79
00:04:49,958 --> 00:04:51,041
What now?

80
00:04:51,125 --> 00:04:54,000
Oh. So The First
has a little sister...

81
00:04:54,083 --> 00:04:56,541
Heh, yeah, I'm sorry if
he's given you any trouble.

82
00:04:56,625 --> 00:04:58,958
He can be really selfish
and an idiot sometimes.

83
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:01,000
I don't think
that's true at all!

84
00:05:01,083 --> 00:05:03,666
I mean, I can't always tell
what he's thinking, sure,

85
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:05,708
but he's actually
very open-minded.

86
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,708
I feel comfortable
when I'm with him.

87
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,750
It's like I can really
be myself, y'know?

88
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:13,083
Wow, I gotta admit,
that's awfully generous of you

89
00:05:13,166 --> 00:05:14,875
to think of Junichiro that way.

90
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,458
[gasps]
What? But it's true.

91
00:05:16,541 --> 00:05:18,791
So what kind of things do you
like to do in your free time?

92
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,041
Other than play video games,
we know that.

93
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:22,916
Oh, and how'd you
meet my brother anyway?

94
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,250
I'm dying to know.

95
00:05:24,333 --> 00:05:25,708
Long story...

96
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:33,333
[KISAKI]
Hey!

97
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,916
Uh?

98
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
You can't ask people about their
offline lives out of the blue.

99
00:05:37,083 --> 00:05:38,583
That's what we call
"bad 'netiquette."

100
00:05:38,666 --> 00:05:40,500
Uh! Really?! I had no idea!

101
00:05:40,583 --> 00:05:43,291
Really? People game
online for a reason.

102
00:05:43,375 --> 00:05:45,791
Pestering them about their
personal lives is poor manners

103
00:05:45,875 --> 00:05:47,833
when you know nothing
about them IRL.

104
00:05:47,916 --> 00:05:49,375
I am so sorry, Luce!

105
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:51,083
I didn't know
anything about that!

106
00:05:51,166 --> 00:05:52,291
Please forgive me!

107
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,125
Hey! No worries!

108
00:05:54,208 --> 00:05:56,958
I'm glad she made that mistake
first so I didn't have to.

109
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,625
Luce, I gotta tell you.

110
00:05:58,708 --> 00:06:01,458
That outfit is super cute.
It looks awesome on you, girl!

111
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,875
Oh. Thank you!
It's one of my favorites.

112
00:06:03,958 --> 00:06:05,708
Do you dress like that
in real life?

113
00:06:05,791 --> 00:06:08,083
I'm sure you could pull it off.
What brands do you like?

114
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:10,125
Yeah! And where do you
like to go shopping?

115
00:06:10,208 --> 00:06:11,666
Are you two kidding me?!

116
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,375
Seriously, what did we
just get done discussing?

[SUZUNE] Wow. I had a ton more
fun that I thought I would!

Gotta say, I'm pretty impressed.

Huh?

00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,125
By your talent.

127
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,958
You managed to take a group of
amateurs and turn them

128
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:51,125
into halfway decent players
in a single day.

129
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:54,041
That's no small feat.
You should be proud of yourself.

I guess your day's wasted.

You prob'ly had no fun hanging
out with "the n00bs."

That's not true!

can lose after today!

I think so, too!

00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:40,083
It's like Luce has
delivered us a blessing

[KANAN] Oh, man.

160

[KIRIKO] I guess we got
carried away, didn't we?

[SUZUNE]
Hey. There you are.

162
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:03,833
[JUNICHIRO]
Yo, what's up?

163
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,916
Did you guys put in a
lot of hard work today?

164
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,500
[SUZUNE]
Yeah, but we owe that to Luce

165
00:08:07,583 --> 00:08:09,083
seeing as she took
the time to teach us,

166
00:08:09,166 --> 00:08:10,541
which, by the way, is your job.

167
00:08:10,625 --> 00:08:12,500
Well, you seem rather calm,
so I'm assuming

168
00:08:12,583 --> 00:08:14,083
you found us
another team member?

169

I got everything taken care of.
There's nothing to worry about.

170

We're all set
to rock this thing.

171
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,333
I see. I guess that
means you met him, then.

172
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:21,958
Huh?

173
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:23,708
Koutaro Araki.

174
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:26,375
You know, the student who's
missing from your roster?

175
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:28,416
Didn't you go to meet
with him today?

176
00:08:30,875 --> 00:08:32,875
[JUNICHIRO]
Now that I think about it.

177
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,583
I didn't really talk
to Koutaro, did I?

178
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:37,416
Wait, you mean you
actually got to see him?

179
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:39,833
So, what? Is he one of
Seijuro's victims?

180
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:40,791
Yeah, right.

181
00:08:40,875 --> 00:08:42,333
Look:

182
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,416
He's been gone so long he wasn't
even at opening ceremonies.

183
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:47,375
There's no way I can beat up a
guy who skips class every day.

[JUNICHIRO] Hmm? What's
the matter, Potatoes?

188
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:55,375
Nothing. I was just thinking,

189
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:57,291
Koutaro and I were in
the same middle school.

190
00:08:57,375 --> 00:08:59,416
Whoa, seriously?
What was he like back then?

191
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,166
Well... I dunno...
We didn't take the same classes.

192
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,583
Didn't even know he existed
until graduation.

193
00:09:04,666 --> 00:09:06,875
All I ever heard about him was a
rumor that he'd gotten

194
00:09:06,958 --> 00:09:08,791
into some trouble and that's
why no one ever really

195
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:10,125
saw him after that.

196
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:14,375
Ah. What kind of trouble?

197
00:09:14,458 --> 00:09:16,958
[KIRIKO] It was something over
spring break in our third year.

198
00:09:17,041 --> 00:09:19,708
I guess he and
a classmate had an incident.

199
00:09:19,791 --> 00:09:22,250
And after that, he stopped
coming to school.

No way! I couldn't have
done it without you all.

473
00:21:16,458 --> 00:21:18,625
[JUNICHIRO]
Hmph.

474
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:21,333
I don't think I've ever felt
this happy after winning a game!

475
00:21:21,416 --> 00:21:23,583
I know! This makes me
wanna keep on playing it!

476
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:26,291
Me, too! I wonder what our
next quest is gonna be!

477
00:21:26,375 --> 00:21:27,625
[gasps]

478
00:21:27,708 --> 00:21:30,000
Whatever it is, you'll
play with us again, right?

479
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:31,500
Uh, sure.

480
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:38,625
[LUCE] I agreed out of reflex,
but I really have to stop.

481
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:41,291
I can't get too close.

482
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:43,333
If I keep playing with them,

483
00:21:43,416 --> 00:21:45,791
they'll figure out
the truth about me...

484
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,458
That I'm a boy...

485
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:49,500
That I'm their classmate...

486
00:21:49,583 --> 00:21:50,958
Everything...

487
00:21:52,666 --> 00:21:54,250
[LUCE]
What now?

488
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,833
What should I do...?

489
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:31,666
[KISAKI]
This is Kisaki Tenjoin,

490
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:33,833
also known as
the Black Mage Kisaki.

491
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,250
That comeback we made
really got my blood boiling.

492
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:38,083
That's the stuff of legends!

493
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:40,458
In the next episode,
Seijuro saves Luce

494
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:41,958
from some skirt chasers.

495
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,833
As a result, Luce reveals
to him his true identity

496
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,125
as the missing student
Koutaro Araki.

497
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,125
Period eleven,
"The Outside World."

498
00:23:50,208 --> 00:23:52,125
I'm not sure what Junichiro
has up his sleeve,

499
00:23:52,208 --> 00:23:56,166
but my interest has been piqued.
Specifically in Koutaro Araki.
