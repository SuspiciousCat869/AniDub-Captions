159
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,541
I was hoping I could
build something here.

160
00:09:08,625 --> 00:09:10,291
The Anywhere Door.

161
00:09:10,375 --> 00:09:11,833
Huh?

162
00:09:11,916 --> 00:09:14,208
[YAMATO] All I kept thinking
was, "who the heck is this guy?"

163
00:09:14,291 --> 00:09:18,416
I mean, you knew absolutely
nothing about physics.

164
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:20,375
But then the scores
for the next exam came out

165
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:22,833
and suddenly you were
at the top of the charts.

166
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:25,125
Well, you did teach me
everything you knew.

167
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:26,958
Wasn't enough to make
your dream come true,

168
00:09:27,041 --> 00:09:28,750
but that didn't stop you
from trying to teleport

169
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,958
a banana with a microwave
at the carnival.

170
00:09:32,041 --> 00:09:34,750
Which was a complete
failure, of course.

171
00:09:34,833 --> 00:09:37,916
It was fun, though.
There's no denying that.

172
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,500
Y'know, I really
outta thank you.

173
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:43,125
You did everything you could
to help me build the door.

174
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,083
Just because it's been
a couple years doesn't mean

175
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:47,625
all the good times
are in the past, so...

176
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:50,375
If you want to,
I can still help you out.

177
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:52,250
Huh?

178
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:54,041
I happen to work for KEC:

179
00:09:54,125 --> 00:09:57,291
Japan's new Graduate
University of Advanced Studies.

180
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,000
And as far as
why I came here tonight...

181
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,625
Well, the reason's
pretty simple.

182
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:05,666
Y'see, we want to
recruit you for our cause.

183
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,708
[JUNICHIRO]
Huuuh?

184
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,708
[YAMATO] At the moment,
our organization is focused

185
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:12,041
on one thing:
beating CERM to the punch

186
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:15,708
by completing our Anywhere Door
before theirs ever starts up.

187
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:16,875
And it's not just us.

188
00:10:16,958 --> 00:10:18,000
Our government
wants to make this

189
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:20,500
a national victory
for Japan, too.

190
00:10:21,916 --> 00:10:23,958
[gasps]

191
00:10:24,041 --> 00:10:27,166
We want you to take on
the position of project leader.

192
00:10:27,250 --> 00:10:28,625
And you can run this operation

193
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,958
in whatever way
you think is best.

194
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,666
These six years
felt like forever.

195
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,916
But every moment was worth it,
because I've finally

196
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,500
made something deserving
of your attention.

197
00:10:43,583 --> 00:10:46,333
Let's be partners again,
Junichiro.

198
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,291
I want to show the world what
our old Science Club is made of!

199
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:54,500
[SUZUNE] Bro! Wake up!
How late are you gonna sleep?

200
00:10:54,583 --> 00:10:55,875
It's already noon,
we'll miss the movie

201
00:10:55,958 --> 00:10:57,333
if we don't get going.

202
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,083
Wait, what the--?

203
00:11:01,166 --> 00:11:02,541
Uuuh...

204
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,958
[YAMATO]
We can take things slow.

205
00:11:08,041 --> 00:11:10,125
Let's start with
visiting the lab.

206
00:11:11,875 --> 00:11:13,625
We'll talk shop later.

207
00:11:13,708 --> 00:11:15,166
[chuckles]

208
00:11:17,541 --> 00:11:18,833
Here comes our exit.

209
00:11:18,916 --> 00:11:19,958
I hope you're ready;
you're gonna get

210
00:11:20,041 --> 00:11:21,708
a real kick out of this one.

211
00:11:21,791 --> 00:11:25,583
Not sure what the big deal is.
It's just a tunnel.

212
00:11:33,708 --> 00:11:35,416
[chuckles]

213
00:11:40,833 --> 00:11:43,791
All right, I officially have
no idea what's going on.

214
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:06,791
[JUNICHIRO]
Whoa.

215
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,541
[chuckles]

216
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,000
[JUNICHIRO] Hey, maybe you
should slow down.

217
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:31,416
This is quite
the elaborate ritual here.

218
00:12:35,291 --> 00:12:37,458
Great, now we're stuck.

219
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,541
--[alarm blares]
--[JUNICHIRO] Hm?

220
00:12:42,833 --> 00:12:44,500
[JUNICHIRO]
Whoa!

221
00:12:49,833 --> 00:12:52,625
[JUNICHIRO]
So cool! This is nuts.

222
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:55,833
I mean. It's like anime
but in real life!

223
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:57,041
Although, I don't
really see the point

224
00:12:57,125 --> 00:12:59,208
in building it underground.

225
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:09,000
[YAMATO] There are
lots of reasons for that,

226
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:11,791
such as having a better
foundation for our facility.

227
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:15,250
We're also better protected from
potential terrorism underground.

228
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:16,875
But the ultimate
deciding factor was

229
00:13:16,958 --> 00:13:18,583
we thought you'd find it cool.

230
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:19,958
Huh?

231
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:23,000
We made the right call.
That's a big relief.

232
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:29,666
[YAMATO] This is it. Feast your
eyes on Castle Junichiro!

233
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,625
Well I gotta say,
you chose a good name for it.

234
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:37,708
[YAMATO] This institution
runs off solar power,

235
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:40,666
and the staff stays on premise
to work day or night.

236
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,041
We're also growing plants.

237
00:13:43,125 --> 00:13:45,416
And get this,
the panels overhead portray

238
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,500
a real-world day-night cycle.

239
00:13:47,583 --> 00:13:50,041
That way the staff feels
more at ease underground.

240
00:13:55,791 --> 00:13:57,166
Aah!

241
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:03,416
By the power of Greyskull!

242
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,458
As you know,
the entire principle behind

243
00:14:05,541 --> 00:14:07,666
the Anywhere Door's
teleportation relies on

244
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:10,333
breaking an object down
to subatomic particles.

245
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:11,875
But to do that,
we have to use this

246
00:14:11,958 --> 00:14:14,458
Large Hadron Collider, or LHC,

247
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:17,041
nergy
to instigate a high
subatomic reaction

248
00:14:17,125 --> 00:14:18,916
to separate the object's
Higgs Particles

249
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,833
from its other
essential elements.

250
00:14:20,916 --> 00:14:23,291
Fortunately for us,
our LHC has almost

251
00:14:23,375 --> 00:14:25,625
twice the energy output
of CERM's.

252
00:14:25,708 --> 00:14:27,500
There's no way we're
going to lose the race

253
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:30,041
to separate the
Higgs Particles to them.

254
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:31,958
As long as you're
on board with us, anyway.

255
00:14:32,041 --> 00:14:34,500
We can't do all this
without you leading our team.

256
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,541
[JUNICHIRO]
Mmm.

257
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,916
Between the tech in our lab,
and you running the show,

258
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,750
we'll complete development
on the Anywhere Door

259
00:14:40,833 --> 00:14:42,458
in no time at all!

260
00:14:42,541 --> 00:14:44,416
Not to change the subject,

261
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:45,833
but could you tell me
why everyone's

262
00:14:45,916 --> 00:14:48,083
been staring at me
since I got here?

263
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:50,916
Isn't it obvious?
The majority of our staff

264
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,916
signed on with us
because they read your paper

265
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,750
that got published
all those years ago.

266
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:59,041
To them, you're a hero.
Like a science rock star.

267
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:02,083
A rock star? Come on.

268
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,083
Do you think I can
get his autograph?

269
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,875
I'm breathing
the same air as Mr. Kagami!

272

[YAMATO]
Hey. Can I ask you something?

273
00:15:15,666 --> 00:15:16,875
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm?

274
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,125
[YAMATO] I was wondering.
After all your work,

275
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,791
why'd you give up
on the Anywhere Door?

276
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:24,250
[JUNICHIRO] I didn't give up,
I completed the theory.

277
00:15:26,208 --> 00:15:27,958
[YAMATO] And the theory's
great, but back in school

278
00:15:28,041 --> 00:15:30,375
you said you wanted to build it.

279
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:32,541
Are you sure I said that?

280
00:15:32,625 --> 00:15:34,791
[YAMATO] Yeah, I am.
That's actually why

281
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,083
I went to a different
university than you.

282
00:15:37,166 --> 00:15:39,666
I had to learn how to make
a place like this a reality

283
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,375
so you could finally
finish what you started.

284
00:15:46,166 --> 00:15:47,416
But somewhere along the line

285
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:50,041
you settled for just
developing the theory.

286
00:15:50,125 --> 00:15:52,541
And then you settled
for being a teacher.

00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:13,291
We're out of the red!
Everything is running

315
00:17:13,375 --> 00:17:14,916
like it's supposed to!

316
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,166
[exhales deeply]

317
00:17:17,250 --> 00:17:18,416
[chuckles]

318
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:22,541
[ALL cheering]

319
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,291
I've gotta say, though it
could have killed us,

320
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:27,541
even the accidents
here are awesome.

321
00:17:27,625 --> 00:17:29,333
[MALE STAFF 22A] No, the only
awesome thing was you,

322
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:30,750
Mr. Kagami!

323
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:31,833
[FEMALE STAFF 22A] It was
amazing watching you work.

324
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,041
Like a dream come true!

325
00:17:33,125 --> 00:17:34,458
[MALE STAFF 22B]
You really saved the day!

326
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:35,791
We'd be lost without you!

327
00:17:35,875 --> 00:17:37,708
[YAMATO]
There's the Junichiro I know.

328
00:17:37,791 --> 00:17:40,458
I was afraid the world
had lost him for good.

329
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:45,750
Huh. That's weird.
I haven't seen him today.

330
00:17:45,833 --> 00:17:47,375
Mr. Kagami hasn't been by.

331
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,416
[distant jingling]

332
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:50,375
Hello and
welcome home, master!

333
00:17:50,458 --> 00:17:53,000
No, I've been playing
since early this morning.

334
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,125
So if Mr. Kagami
had come through here,

335
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:56,375
I would have seen him.

336
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:57,708
[KISAKI]
You can't find Junichiro?

337
00:17:57,791 --> 00:17:59,833
He hasn't been here,
that's for sure.

338
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,541
Now that's hot stuff!

339
00:18:01,625 --> 00:18:03,291
[chuckles]

340
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,458
[KISAKI]
Well that was rude.

341
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:10,000
[SUZUNE]
C'mon, bro.

342
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:14,125
[sighs]
Where the heck are you?

343
00:18:14,208 --> 00:18:16,166
Finally!

344
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:18,708
Hey! I found you!

345
00:18:18,791 --> 00:18:22,083
[MAN 22A]
What the--? Huh?

346
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,708
[SUZUNE] Sorry! I thought you
were someone else. Excuse me!

347
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:30,708
[SUZUNE] I can't believe
he blew me off after I said

348
00:18:30,791 --> 00:18:33,166
I'd go to this
silly movie with him.

349
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:35,000
You're such a jerk, big bro!

350
00:18:35,083 --> 00:18:36,458
[ALL]
Huh?!

351
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,333
[YAMATO] I can't thank you
enough for earlier.

352
00:18:41,416 --> 00:18:43,166
You saved us all.

353
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:46,166
Oh, so you are aware
of how much trouble we were in.

354
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,250
Huh?

355
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:48,750
Just a little
observation I've made.

356
00:18:48,833 --> 00:18:50,833
That could have been
a serious disaster.

357
00:18:50,916 --> 00:18:54,833
Yet your whole staff is carrying
on like it was no big deal.

358
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:57,125
But I guess when you're that
focused on building something,

359
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,791
you don't let the setbacks
slow you down much.

360
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,416
Even though you brought
it up, it doesn't seem

361
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:03,333
to bother you that much either.

362
00:19:03,416 --> 00:19:05,791
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm? Well, I did fix it.

363
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:07,041
[YAMATO chuckles]

364
00:19:07,125 --> 00:19:08,666
All the more reason
you should quit teaching

365
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:11,125
to join KEC, I say.

366
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:17,125
You know,
I never told you this,

367
00:19:17,208 --> 00:19:19,125
but I've always been really
happy that you asked me

368
00:19:19,208 --> 00:19:20,916
to help you build the door.

369
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,458
I never put this into words,

370
00:19:22,541 --> 00:19:24,625
but those are some of
my fondest memories.

371
00:19:24,708 --> 00:19:26,666
That's why I wanted
to do all this.

372
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:28,250
And that's why
I've devoted my life

373
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,750
to completing this research.

374
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:34,000
I know you've had fun here,
even if you won't admit it.

375
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:37,541
So why are you shying away
from the thing you want?

376
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:40,583
I mean, you've gotta
find teaching boring.

377
00:19:42,541 --> 00:19:44,458
What do you say?

378
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,625
[JUNICHIRO] Sorry.
But I need some more time

379
00:19:48,708 --> 00:19:50,500
to think about it.

380
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,041
[JUNICHIRO] Man. Everything
Yamato has said about me

381
00:19:56,125 --> 00:19:57,500
has been right on the money.

382
00:19:57,583 --> 00:20:01,500
So why can't I bring myself
to accept the offer?

383
00:20:01,583 --> 00:20:03,625
[KOYOMI] If you'd like,
I can answer that for you.

384
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,000
Huh? Wait, what the heck
are you doing here, Options?

385
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,250
How did you even get inside?

386
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,000
This place can't be
open to the public,

387
00:20:11,083 --> 00:20:12,916
what with all
the secret tunnels.

388
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,666
[giggles]
How observant of you!

389
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,083
When we met, I told you
I was "loaded with options,"

390
00:20:18,166 --> 00:20:21,166
but you've never fully
realized what that entails.

391
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:23,083
So there's your answer.

392
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:24,875
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm?

393
00:20:24,958 --> 00:20:27,375
With that in mind, there are
any number of possibilities

394
00:20:27,458 --> 00:20:30,458
as to how I know you're
being recruited by KEC.

395
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:34,458
And how I know that you haven't
come to a decision yet.

396
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:36,583
But beyond all of that,
I'm aware of the reason

397
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:39,458
as to why you can't make
yourself accept the offer.

398
00:20:39,541 --> 00:20:41,083
Oh, yeah, and why not?

399
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,791
Your apprehension
is due to the fact that

400
00:20:42,875 --> 00:20:45,708
you no longer feel like
you need the Anywhere Door.

401
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,125
[grunts]

402
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,083
Or to be more precise,
you no longer feel as if

403
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:51,625
you need to be
the one to build it.

404
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,791
And so, you can't bring
yourself to take the job.

405
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,416
[JUNICHIRO] Are you going
somewhere with this?

406
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,708
Oh come now, you should
know better than anyone else

407
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:04,166
what this means.
Dear, Mr. Kagami.

408
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,500
[JUNICHIRO]
Mmm...

409
00:21:06,583 --> 00:21:09,208
Well, if you
really can't figure it out,

410
00:21:09,291 --> 00:21:12,250
I guess It's time
to start the lesson.

411
00:21:14,125 --> 00:21:17,666
Now, effective immediately,
Junichiro Kagami,

412
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:19,958
you are hereby terminated.

413
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,458
Huh? I'm fired?

414
00:21:22,541 --> 00:21:24,916
Afraid so.
I have no other choice.

415
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:26,958
Seeing as you have yet to
understand your role

416
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:30,000
as a teacher, your
termination is unavoidable.

417
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:33,291
Or you could just tell me
what you want me to know.

418
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:35,500
I'm sure you can
put it together on your own.

419
00:21:35,583 --> 00:21:38,083
So until you do, feel free
to waste all your energy

420
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:39,833
on building a door.

421
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:45,416
Thanks for the pep talk.
I feel so much better now.

422
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:53,375
Where the heck
have you gone this time?

423
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,291
Come on, bro.

424
00:23:30,375 --> 00:23:32,250
[REIKO] Hey, everyone,
I'm Reiko Mukyo,

425
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:35,083
a first-year high school
student at Hiiragi Academy!

426
00:23:35,166 --> 00:23:36,625
I've got a bit of
an advantage in life

427
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:38,291
thanks to a special ability.

428
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,166
All I have to do
is watch something once,

429
00:23:40,250 --> 00:23:41,708
and then I can do it too!

430
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,750
Next episode,
I get to be an intern

431
00:23:43,833 --> 00:23:46,250
at the top-secret
KEC labs for a day!

432
00:23:46,333 --> 00:23:48,458
I'm hoping it's not boring,
because I'm only interested

433
00:23:48,541 --> 00:23:50,041
in doing amusing things!

434
00:23:50,125 --> 00:23:52,958
Period twenty-three,
"The Job Try Out Girl."

435
00:23:53,041 --> 00:23:56,666
Mr. Kagami, teach me how
to have fun just like you!
