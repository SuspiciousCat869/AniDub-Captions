You used to be some
fancy pants, but you gave up

It's totally not true.
I designed an "Anywhere Door"

Or to be more specific, it could
be real, if someone followed

221
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:56,375
the awesome theoretical
blueprints that I created.

222
00:09:56,458 --> 00:09:59,250
I sent a paper about it to
one of those science magazines.

223
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:01,291
They really dug the idea.

224
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,291
And then, I finished
the blueprints.

225

I was still just a student.

So, you gave up on research
after only one project?

interested in academics

[GIRLS whimper]

478
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,375
I said I wanted to get through
this on my own, didn't I?

479
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:46,958
What even made you think
I needed you to interfere?

480
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:51,333
If there's no hero,
then become a hero, right?

481
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:53,291
[gasps]

482
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,250
[JUNICHIRO] But Sergeant
Saunders from Bura-Kura

483
00:20:55,333 --> 00:20:57,458
still gets plenty of help
from Corporal Hartman

484
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,916
when she finds
herself in a pinch.

485
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,250
[gasps]

486
00:21:01,333 --> 00:21:03,833
[JUNICHIRO] Even Batman
has Robin for a sidekick.

487
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:05,416
[sighs]

488
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:07,875
[JUNICHIRO] Being a hero
may be a lonely fight,

489
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:11,000
but that doesn't mean
you have to do it alone.

490
00:21:11,083 --> 00:21:13,250
[laughs]

491
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:15,250
[JUNICHIRO]
Right, Little Rabbit?

492
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,500
[gasps]

493
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:18,958
Yeah, I know. "YD."

494
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:22,000
But there is still plenty
of stuff I yearn to do.

495
00:21:22,083 --> 00:21:23,041
[MINAKO gasps]

496
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:28,791
[JUNICHIRO] And that concludes
my lesson for the day.

497
00:21:28,875 --> 00:21:31,791
He knew, all this time.

498
00:21:34,291 --> 00:21:37,708
[MINAKO] He saved me.
He changed my life.

499
00:21:40,541 --> 00:21:44,958
K.Y! Thank you!

500
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,791
[GIRL laughs]

501
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:53,375
[GIRL] What an
interesting teacher.

502
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:55,958
Very intriguing indeed.

503
00:23:31,250 --> 00:23:34,166
[MINAKO] Hi, it's Minako Kanou,
AKA Face Punch!

504
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:35,708
I guess I can
tolerate that nickname

505
00:23:35,791 --> 00:23:37,333
for the preview
at least, seeing as

506
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,541
Mr. Kagami saved my life twice.

507
00:23:39,625 --> 00:23:40,958
Anyway, next episode,

508
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:43,666
our YD hero runs afoul of
the class representative!

509
00:23:43,750 --> 00:23:45,458
Let's see if his
homegrown otaku wisdom

510
00:23:45,541 --> 00:23:47,000
can get him out of this one!

511
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,666
Wait, what's this about
him molesting a girl?

512
00:23:49,750 --> 00:23:53,208
Period two, "The Laws of
Society." If that rumor's true,

513
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:55,416
you're gonna get more
than just a face punch!

514
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,333
By the way, what was up
with that girl at the end?
