[JUNICHIRO]
I have YD.

00:00:11,916 --> 00:00:13,666
You say you've
never heard of it?

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,916
What? I like wearing yukata
on dates? Or yummy dinners?

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,583
Wrong! It's a
debilitating illness

5
00:00:20,666 --> 00:00:23,708
where you can only do
what you yearn to do.

00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:51,833
Let's go! Ready, Luce?

10
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:53,375
You bet!

11
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:04,958
3, 2, and 1. It's the end
of the line, Ancient Dragon!

12
00:01:05,041 --> 00:01:06,541
[ANCIENT DRAGON growls]

13
00:01:06,625 --> 00:01:09,666
I call on the power of the
Sky Spirits and implore thee

14
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:13,291
to Shield my body and
Strike down my foes!

Spiritual Guard Skill Activated.

16
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:20,041

00:01:27,416 --> 00:01:29,666
Okay, First! It's your turn!

My unblockable Dual Wield

00:01:34,916 --> 00:01:37,166
You're going down!

22
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,250
I've got him now, Luce.
Watch this!

23
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:44,083
[JUNICHIRO yells]

[ANCIENT DRAGON roars]

26
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,375
[MAN A] You're telling
me they defeated

27
00:03:36,458 --> 00:03:39,625
the Ancient Dragon by
themselves? I don't buy it!

28
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:41,041
How could two
people beat one of

29
00:03:41,125 --> 00:03:43,208
the most difficult
quests in Uroboros?

30
00:03:43,291 --> 00:03:45,041
[MAN B] I heard they finished
off that freakin' dragon

31
00:03:45,125 --> 00:03:47,125
in world record
time, no less!

32
00:03:47,208 --> 00:03:50,291
Someone told me that they took
out a 20-man raiding party.

33
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,708
I thought the rumor was bull,

34
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:53,500
but maybe these
two're the real deal.

35
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:55,791
I wish I could be
as strong as them.

36
00:03:55,875 --> 00:03:59,250
Godspeed Red Knight
the First is my hero.

37
00:03:59,333 --> 00:04:02,541
And Luce the Ironclad
Nun is so graceful!

38
00:04:02,625 --> 00:04:04,083
[JUNICHIRO] I thought the
Ancient Dragon would be harder

39
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,375
to take down, but we
beat it, no sweat.

40
00:04:06,458 --> 00:04:09,791
It appears there's not much left
we can do together in Uroboros.

41
00:04:09,875 --> 00:04:12,333
But look at how much we
did get done this last year.

42
00:04:12,416 --> 00:04:13,458
And none of it would
have been possible

43
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:16,500
if we weren't
working together.

44
00:04:16,583 --> 00:04:19,208
No one ever noticed me,
let alone offered to help,

45
00:04:19,291 --> 00:04:22,083
until you pledged to
wield your sword beside me.

46
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,833
It took a lot of grinding,
but now you've got

47
00:04:23,916 --> 00:04:26,583
all your skills maxed
and all that awesome gear.

48
00:04:26,666 --> 00:04:27,958
Well, thank you,
'cause there's no way

49
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,583
I could've cleared
that stuff on my own,

50
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:32,833
let alone finished every single
small party quest in the game.

51
00:04:32,916 --> 00:04:35,041
We still have one last
thing we could do.

52
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:36,666
It'd be a good challenge.

53
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,041
You're not talking
about tomorrow's

54
00:04:38,125 --> 00:04:40,166
Mega Battle Event, are you?

55
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,375
I think you misread the
email about it, because that's

56
00:04:42,458 --> 00:04:46,666
only for large teams.
We're not eligible to join.

57
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:49,166
We are extremely proud to
announce the once-in-a-lifetime

58
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:52,375
"Battle of Uro," a Large
Squad Mega Battle Event

59

For Quest Teams with
35 Members or More.

60
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:58,750
Lame! 35? Fine then!

61
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,333
[LUCE]
Uh--?

62
00:05:00,416 --> 00:05:02,583
[JUNICHIRO] Listen, Luce,
there's no way I'm giving up

63
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,166
without finishing
all the quests.

64
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,833
Let's unlock one final trophy.
What do ya say?

65
00:05:06,916 --> 00:05:09,041
Um. Okay. If we can.

66
00:05:09,125 --> 00:05:12,416
Good! All right. Start up
a private training room.

67
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,791
I'll meet you there
in just about 3 hours.

68
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,125
Uh, but First...

69
00:05:16,208 --> 00:05:19,291
Don't worry. I know
where to recruit our squad.

70
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:22,083
I'm gonna log out now, but I'll
be back before you miss me!

71
00:05:22,166 --> 00:05:23,916
Oh, you have to go?

72
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,500
Yeah?

73
00:05:25,583 --> 00:05:27,875
You haven't been hanging around
too much after quests lately.

74
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,708
Is something going on
outside the game?

75
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,583
Sorry, I have been busy.

76
00:05:31,666 --> 00:05:33,291
No! Don't apologize!
I shouldn't have asked

77
00:05:33,375 --> 00:05:36,833
about your I.R.L. stuff. It's
totally rude. I'm so mortified.

78
00:05:36,916 --> 00:05:39,833
Hey, don't worry about it! We've
got bigger fish to fry anyway,

79
00:05:39,916 --> 00:05:43,041
so I'll see you in a few hours
to train for tomorrow's event!

80
00:05:43,125 --> 00:05:44,583
Later!

[JUNICHIRO yawns]

83
00:05:54,166 --> 00:05:58,583

should go to work.

Hey, Mr. Kagami!

86
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,125
Eh? 'Sup, Twin-Tails?

87
00:06:05,208 --> 00:06:07,041
Am I too late for class
again or something?

88
00:06:07,125 --> 00:06:09,125
Y'know, you probably
shouldn't shout at a teacher.

89
00:06:09,208 --> 00:06:11,666
Rude. But whatever,
I just wanted to let you know

90
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,000
Sachiko is officially
back at school now.

91
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,500
Great. Are you gonna pitch me
a plot for this week's ep?

92
00:06:16,583 --> 00:06:19,416
Even though you yourself
are a complete delinquent,

93
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:22,666
you've made some impressive
achievements as a mentor.

94
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,333
For example, you've
helped Miss Chinami

95
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:26,833
improve her grades tremendously.
And you've convinced her

96
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:29,500
to speak in public for the
first time since grade school!

97
00:06:29,583 --> 00:06:30,875
An amazing feat!

98
00:06:30,958 --> 00:06:32,958
You've also somehow
managed to get Icho Academy's

99
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:36,875
most notorious truant and
malcontent to come to classes.

100
00:06:36,958 --> 00:06:38,875
You've earned formal praise
from Madam Chairperson

101
00:06:38,958 --> 00:06:40,125
as well as myself.

102
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:41,666
You hit your head?

103
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,208
[MAKINA] I'm giving you
a compliment, weirdo!

104
00:06:43,291 --> 00:06:45,291
Why do you have to make
everything difficult?

105
00:06:45,375 --> 00:06:47,125
Thanks, I guess.
Can I go?

106
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:49,000
I'm not finished.
Sachiko wasn't the only

107
00:06:49,083 --> 00:06:51,125
truant you needed
to bring back.

108
00:06:51,208 --> 00:06:52,666
You shouldn't just
rest on your laurels.

109
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,083
You have a responsibility
to class 2-3,

110
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:57,375
and the administration
expects your support,

111
00:06:57,458 --> 00:06:59,541
Mister Kagami.

112
00:06:59,625 --> 00:07:04,291
Hm. Now I wonder. Was there
a point to all of that noise?

113
00:07:04,375 --> 00:07:09,333
[SEIJURO grunts]

114

[KISAKI] Hold that pose...
The details of your muscles

115
00:07:11,791 --> 00:07:15,458
are going to make my next manga
look absolutely wonderful!

116
00:07:15,541 --> 00:07:18,833
Can you please hurry it up?
My arms are getting worn out.

117
00:07:18,916 --> 00:07:22,833
That pose too tough for you,
big man? Oh, well. That's fine.

118
00:07:22,916 --> 00:07:24,625
Hm. On to the next one!

119
00:07:24,708 --> 00:07:25,625
The next?

120
00:07:25,708 --> 00:07:27,500
Now, maid, come join muscles!

121
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,541
Okay!

122
00:07:28,625 --> 00:07:29,625
[SEIJURO groans]

123
00:07:29,708 --> 00:07:32,333
Stop whining!
You make it sound awful.

124
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,208
Like I'm some kind
of heavy old maid!

125
00:07:34,291 --> 00:07:37,541
[SEIJURO] Mm... What did
I get myself into?

126
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:40,541
Tell me there's some sort of
logical explanation for this.

127
00:07:40,625 --> 00:07:42,500
Kisaki only agreed to
come back to class

128
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,125
if she's allowed to
work on her manga,

129
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,166
so Mister Kagami said
we should just go along

130
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:49,541
with whatever she wants us
to do, no questions asked.

131
00:07:49,625 --> 00:07:51,208
So he's bribing her
to come to school

132
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:53,541
and turned our classroom
into this circus?

133
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:54,791
Don't think of it
as a bribe.

134
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:57,250
It's more like, manga is
what she yearns to do,

135
00:07:57,333 --> 00:08:00,291
so he wants to encourage her
and get her to come to school.

136
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,666
Well, when you
put it like that...

137
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:05,125
"Classroom of the Terminus"
is my favorite book right now,

138
00:08:05,208 --> 00:08:06,958

Today's lesson is different!
I woke up with a revelation.

143
00:08:21,791 --> 00:08:23,541
You need The History of Warfare!

144
00:08:23,625 --> 00:08:26,125
[students gasp]

145
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,875
[SUZUNE] War history?
What's he talking about?

146
00:08:28,958 --> 00:08:31,791
Man, I think he is definitely
getting us into something weird.

147
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,000
Mr. Kagami's a genius,
so I know he's got

148
00:08:34,083 --> 00:08:36,208
a good reason for
lecturing us on this!

got a good plan!

00:08:49,208 --> 00:08:51,458
I want the answer
for "what is life?"

157
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:53,500
[SUZUNE] What does that
have to do with anything?

So, you don't know, huh?

Well then, let me
explain it to you.

160
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,583
Life by its very
definition is battle!

Uh...

As you all move forward
and graduate, you will

00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:06,500
undoubtedly encounter devious
foes and colleagues alike!

If you expect to defeat
the nefarious people

an understanding

of warfare, passed down
to us by our ancestors!

This is kind of

I mean, these characters you've
created look exactly like us.

There's no way my mom

I need you to listen up.

I brought you together
here for a single purpose.

Tomorrow, they're holding a Mega

I'll be the General,

if you can win here,

win everywhere!

She's seen me through a lot
of my battles in Uroboros

224
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:35,125
and made this lesson
possible. Meet Luce!

be my Lieutenant tomorrow.

to do now that we're here?

He said we're
going to a battle,

so there will be some
kind of fight, obviously.

Then I don't want
this stupid sword.

Are you sure you can trust
all of these outsiders?

that one might

00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,666
find out about
your offline life?

Oh, don't worry.
They all already know.

I'm otaku, but I'm also
a high school teacher,

250
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:34,833

from my class for the event.

the fullest sense
of your training,

268
00:13:15,625 --> 00:13:17,208
you'll need to understand
what your role is gonna be,

269
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,083
and how you'll coordinate
with one another in order

and battle efficiency.

apparently too complicated,

make things a bit more clear.

00:14:50,250 --> 00:14:51,625
My sweet monster...

309
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:55,041
Let's see if you can handle
this one! Skill activate!

310
00:14:55,125 --> 00:14:56,708
Mysterious... Dance!

311
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,875
Paralyze Arrow!

312
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,250
I can't move!

313
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:04,375
Hey, Potatoes, you're
not supposed to dance

314
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,916
on the front lines. As a
Dancer, your primary role

315
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,416
is support, so you should
stay near the rear guard!

316
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:11,625
Yep! I understand now.

317
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:13,958
Seijuro, I hate to admit it,
but none of us are going

318
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,125
to hit him if we keep
attacking one at a time.

319
00:15:16,208 --> 00:15:17,833
One day I'll be good
enough to be able

320
00:15:17,916 --> 00:15:19,750
to take him down on my own!

321
00:15:19,833 --> 00:15:20,916
Can you go ahead
and put down

322
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,250
that chip on your
shoulder for today?

323
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,250
[SEIJURO grunts]

324
00:15:23,333 --> 00:15:25,333
So, you suggest
teaming up, huh?

325
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,625
Now you're gettin' it.

326
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,041
We move quick, I run point,
you cover my back.

327
00:15:29,125 --> 00:15:30,708
He can't take us both.

328
00:15:30,791 --> 00:15:33,041
I'm down for whatever you
suggest. I just hope we can

329
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:36,291
wipe that idiotic smirk
off Mister Kagami's face.

330
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:37,708
Sounds good to me.

331
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,916
Okay then. Ready? Set!

332
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:40,875
And let's go!

333
00:15:40,958 --> 00:15:42,791
[SUZUNE and SEIJURO yell]

334
00:15:42,875 --> 00:15:45,166
I see they've teamed up
to fight a stronger foe.

335
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,500
Not a bad tactic at all!

336
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,958
[SUZUNE and SEIJURO yell]

337
00:15:48,041 --> 00:15:49,541
But then again...

338
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:53,166
[SEIJURO and SUZUNE groan]

339
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,958
When you're challenging
an overwhelming force,

340
00:15:55,041 --> 00:15:56,916
even a strong tactic
won't be enough.

341
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,375
[KISAKI]
Hey, teach!

342
00:15:58,458 --> 00:16:00,833
What if the team is not two,
but actually three of us?

343
00:16:00,916 --> 00:16:02,041
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

344
00:16:02,125 --> 00:16:04,958
Black Magic, Deep Blue.
I'm coming for you--

345
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,125
[LUCE]
Spell Break.

346
00:16:06,208 --> 00:16:08,000
[KISAKI groans]

347
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,708
The element of surprise
can be very effective indeed.

348
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,916
But you were too confident
and forgot that the First

349
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,791
has a partner fighting
alongside him as well.

350
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:17,291
Regrettably.

351
00:16:17,375 --> 00:16:18,916
Man, she took Kisaki down!

352
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:21,250
Yeah, I'm not even
gonna embarrass myself.

353
00:16:21,333 --> 00:16:24,500
Now don't freak
out on me. Heh.

354
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,875
After all, you still
have to strike

355
00:16:25,958 --> 00:16:28,083
if you want to
land a lucky blow!

356
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,958
If you make the attempt
and it gets you nowhere,

357
00:16:30,041 --> 00:16:31,458
then use your head
and change up the moves

358
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,208
you face your challenge with!

359
00:16:33,291 --> 00:16:34,583
In this game, and in life,

360
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,750
that's the most
effective strategy!

361
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:39,583
I've had it. Let's take 'im.

362
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:41,041
But Seijuro...

363
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,333
He's humiliated us. We can't
let him get away with this

364
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:45,333
without getting
knocked down a peg.

365
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:48,041
You're not wrong, but rushing
at them headlong with our eyes

366
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,458
down like a herd of bulls
isn't going to work either.

367
00:16:50,541 --> 00:16:51,875
Watch it!

368
00:16:51,958 --> 00:16:53,958
Pairs aren't enough. We
definitely need teams of four.

369
00:16:54,041 --> 00:16:55,875
Oh, I bet my razor
sharp dancing moves

370
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,583
would work as a great decoy!

371
00:16:57,666 --> 00:16:59,208
OK, everybody's
thinking fast now,

372
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:00,875
but first we've gotta
break those two up.

with your plan yet?

[SEIJURO]
What the heck is that?

385
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:41,083
[KIRIKO] Whatever they
are, they don't look

386
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,250
like they wanna
make friends with us!

387
00:17:43,333 --> 00:17:44,416
[LUCE] The mob you
see approaching you

388
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,208
is controlled by the A.I.

389
00:17:46,291 --> 00:17:50,125
Tomorrow's event is competitive,
but it's PVE, not PVP,

390
00:17:50,208 --> 00:17:53,208
so we'll need to train against
large groups of enemies.

391
00:17:53,291 --> 00:17:54,791
What's important
here is that everybody

392
00:17:54,875 --> 00:17:56,833
gets on the same strategic page.

393
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:59,375
You need to pay attention to the
direction of the battle and take

394
00:17:59,458 --> 00:18:02,958
special care to heed the advice
that Luce and I offer you.

395
00:18:03,041 --> 00:18:05,291
[LUCE] During a large-scale
raid, communication is key.

396
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:08,125
You have to make sure to execute
your attacks at the right time

397
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:10,750
and in response to
both enemies and allies.

Follow our orders
and we'll all experience

the spoils of victory together!

00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:16,625

on these ugly suckers!

Huh?

428
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:14,333
I'm not sure. There's 33
students in my class,

but only 32 on the
battlefield right now.

could have missed someone.

[KISAKI] Are you actually
that dense, Junichiro?

There is still another truant.
Remember? I wasn't the only

student in your class that
had an attendance problem.

[JUNICHIRO]
Mm.

435
00:19:30,291 --> 00:19:32,166
[KISAKI] I'm sure you've
never properly taken roll

since you started
at Icho Academy.

It's not a surprise
you didn't notice.

00:19:36,166 --> 00:19:39,458
Well. With me and Luce,
that's 34 of us, but we're still

439
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:43,375
one short of the requirement
for tomorrow's event.

440
00:19:43,458 --> 00:19:46,000
I know what I need to do! I'm
gonna go to that kid's house

441
00:19:46,083 --> 00:19:47,708
and drag 'em to school
with my bare hands!

00:19:47,791 --> 00:19:49,166
What? The battle's tomorrow!

443
00:19:49,250 --> 00:19:51,250
You'll never get them
here in time to train!

But I guess you probably
knew that already.

emailed me that roll sheet

449
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:10,583
the other day. I should be
able to use that to figure out

450
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,791
which kid is missing
and their address.

Must be this dude.

[ARAKI'S MOTHER] Thank you.
It's so thoughtful of you

453
00:20:17,666 --> 00:20:19,833
to come all this way
to check on my child.

454

No problem, Ma'am.

Uh, would you like some tea?

No, that's alright.
Thank you, though.

very much for your help.

So, is there anything
wrong with him?

been locked up in his room

let alone anyone else.

464
00:20:39,916 --> 00:20:41,250
It's terrible.

465
00:20:41,333 --> 00:20:43,625
Don't you worry! I'll have
him attending school again

466
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,833
whether he likes it or not!

467
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:49,333
[JUNICHIRO] Otherwise I can kiss
tomorrow's Mega Battle goodbye!

468
00:20:49,416 --> 00:20:50,708
[ARAKI'S MOTHER] Wow,
you are such a passionate

469
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,083
and young teacher!

470
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,000
So, this is
your son's room?

471
00:20:57,791 --> 00:20:59,500
Electronic security?

472
00:20:59,583 --> 00:21:02,916
Jeez, you weren't exaggerating.
He really is locked in there!

473
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,625
Yes, and I'm afraid
the circumstances

474
00:21:04,708 --> 00:21:05,916
are a little complicated.

475
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,291
[JUNICHIRO]
Uh--?

476
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:08,666
I don't know if it would
really be of any assistance,

477
00:21:08,750 --> 00:21:10,666
but I could call out
Koutaro's name for you.

478
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,500
Thanks for offering,
but that's really okay.

479
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,166
There's no time to
worry about formalities--

480
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:18,250
I'm just gonna hack this keycode
panel and get that door open.

481
00:21:18,333 --> 00:21:19,250
[beeping]

482
00:21:19,333 --> 00:21:20,250
[click]

483
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:21,458
[JUNICHIRO]
Heh!

484
00:21:21,541 --> 00:21:24,583
Koutaro! My name is
Mr. Junichiro Kagami,

485
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,000
and you're a truant--

486
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,541
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

487
00:21:31,625 --> 00:21:34,000
[LUCE gasps]

488
00:21:34,083 --> 00:21:36,750
Luce? What?

489
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:40,041
The First?
What are you doing here?

490
00:21:40,125 --> 00:21:42,416
[LUCE yelps]

491
00:21:42,500 --> 00:21:44,375
[JUNICHIRO]
Wait, Luce is really...?

492
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:47,291
No, never mind that.
I thought this was...

493
00:21:47,375 --> 00:21:50,166
Um, Mr. Kagami, please meet...

494
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:52,666
...my beautiful son, Koutaro.

495
00:21:53,916 --> 00:21:57,041
[JUNICHIRO stammers]

496
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:34,291
[JUNICHIRO] Godspeed Red Knight
the First, here! What's up?

497
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:36,333
What a shocker for
me to discover firsthand

498
00:23:36,416 --> 00:23:39,791
that Luce is really the
truant Koutaro Araki!

499
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,500
Next episode, I got the missing
spot on our battle team

500
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:45,083
filled by you-know-who
with a little trickery.

501
00:23:45,166 --> 00:23:48,166
But just when I thought we
were good to go, Luce runs off!

502
00:23:48,250 --> 00:23:51,125
Period 10,
"The Melancholy of Koutaro."

503
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,041
Luce, no matter where you run,
I'll be here for you.

504
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:57,083
You are my awesome
questing partner, after all!
