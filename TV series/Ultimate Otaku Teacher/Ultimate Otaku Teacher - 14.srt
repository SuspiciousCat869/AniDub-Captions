[JUNICHIRO] Three weeks ago,
I managed to convince Suzune

23
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,458
to start giving me lunch money

24
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,958
instead of making me
brown bag every day.

Little does she know,

26
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:50,500
I've actually been
saving the cash

But that ends today,

00:02:54,833 --> 00:02:56,666
because I've finally
saved up enough money

Dude, what?

37
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,458
But that's cutting the Muscle

00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:11,625

or something, right?

Well I'm impressed.

I didn't know you could do
math like that in your head!

Of course, it doesn't
change the fact

that you yourself are only
worth six-fifty, little boy!

[MAKINA grunts]

56
00:03:47,041 --> 00:03:49,041
[MAKINA]
Her name's Madoka Kuramochi.

57
00:03:49,125 --> 00:03:51,291
She has a talent for
determining the net worth

58
00:03:51,375 --> 00:03:53,958
of anything she
looks at on the fly.

That includes people,
just so you know.

60
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:59,208
Sounds like a big
shot naming a bounty.

61
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:01,583
She's been a big help
to the student council.

62
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,083
It may seem a little cold,

63
00:04:03,166 --> 00:04:05,541
but she's never given out a
budget that's gone to waste.

64
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:07,500
Despite only being
in her first year,

65
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:10,208
she's already our
full-time accountant.

66
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:13,125
And one day she'll inherit
her family's company.

67
00:04:13,208 --> 00:04:14,708
She's hacked.

68
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:16,833
There's no way to have such high
character stats without cheats.

means her life is easy.

a variety of dishes cultivated

from some of his all-time,
favorite shows!

No way, this is
real manga meat!

325
00:13:47,916 --> 00:13:49,416
And the spaghetti
and eggs 'n toast

326
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,125
are from some of the best anime!

327

Yeah, great.

What I meant to say is
"it's not that good,"

so don't get any ideas!

Here, I have a special
treat for you, darlin'.

Cheese toast from the alps!

Yummy dinner!

[MADOKA] What did you think?
Was my cooking to your liking?

You'd better believe it was!
Best meal ever!

Well in that case. Got a pen?

Oh, no!

Now, now,
don't be so coy!

You know full well
why I came over.

I'm here to prove how
valuable I am to you.

00:14:49,208 --> 00:14:51,291
Now admit it and
we can get married!

[JUNICHIRO gasps]

00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:54,416
I hate to say this,
but I'm impressed.

356
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,000
Despite being younger than me,
you're a much better cook.

357
00:14:57,083 --> 00:14:58,541
That's totally unfair.

Just look at this place,
it's spotless!

Your housekeeping
skills are top notch.

Thanks. But honestly,
this was a slice a pie.

My family's trained me for
much worse than this place!

Whoa.

By the way, I went ahead and
drew a bath for ya, Darling.

Don't tell me
you've never heard,

"absence makes the

I'll be right here.

[JUNICHIRO]
Thanks, sis.

[JUNICHIRO] I wonder what
Miss Money Bags is up to?

I get it. She likes me.

But why be so forward
about all this?

380
00:15:47,291 --> 00:15:49,041
And now that I
think about it,

381
00:15:49,125 --> 00:15:51,458
why would the heiress to a video
game company need to be

382

cooking and cleaning?

Oh, c'mon now.

389
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,625
I scaled down the balcony,
jumped into the family room,

390
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:09,916
and snuck in through
a side window!

I had to 'cause your sister
locked her bedroom door.

[JUNICHIRO]
You should've taken the hint!

393

We have to get to
know each other

and what better way than
for us to just bare all?

They're thorough and exact,
and it's worked very well here

406
00:16:41,708 --> 00:16:44,791
because you've nailed
my interests to a T.

407

So you must know I wouldn't like
the straightforward approach,

One day, I want to marry

This is freakin' incredible!

481
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,708
He's actually gonna do it!
Who is this guy?

482
00:19:40,791 --> 00:19:41,750
[chuckles]

483
00:19:54,125 --> 00:19:55,458
[MADOKA sighs]

484
00:19:55,541 --> 00:19:58,041
[JUNICHIRO] The world's
largest video game company,

485
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,666
is Activision-Frigate.

486
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:03,666
Total corporate
stock value: two-trillion.

487
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:06,166
Mr. Kagami.

488
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Hope you don't mind,

489
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,083
but I went ahead and did some
research on your company.

490
00:20:10,166 --> 00:20:13,625
If they opted for
a buyout. That'd be it.

491
00:20:13,708 --> 00:20:18,666
KMC's only worth ten-billion,
so there's no choice, is there?

492
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,291
That why you've been in
such a rush to get married?

493
00:20:23,416 --> 00:20:28,000
I guess when it comes to you,
I can't hide anything, can I?

494
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,041
Ah, well.

495
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:31,041
No point in beating
around the bush.

496
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:33,666
There's actually a secret
condition to that agreement.

497
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,250
It involves me.

498
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:38,041
In order for our employees

499
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,833
to remain on staff
after the big buy out,

500
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:42,708
I have to take the hand of the

501
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:45,500
chief executive
officer in matrimony.

502
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,541
[gasps]

503
00:20:48,791 --> 00:20:51,625
But if I decline his proposal,
they'll fire every one

504
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:54,208
of our workers without
a second thought.

505
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:55,916
This is exactly what my parents

506
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,958
were getting ready for when they
trained me in housekeepin'.

507
00:20:59,041 --> 00:21:03,375
So, no, I don't have any
choice in the matter.

508
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,458
Now do you see?

509
00:21:05,541 --> 00:21:06,708
That's why...

510
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,791
I literally know
how much I'm worth.

511
00:21:12,875 --> 00:21:14,958
Sorry I kept this from you.

512
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:16,833
I didn't want you to have
any reason to doubt my

513
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,500
feelings were true.

514
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:21,416
Because I really would
like to marry you.

515
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,208
Call me a coward.

516
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,875
[MADOKA] I figured if
I had you by my side.

517
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:29,000
I could make all my
dreams come true.

518
00:21:29,083 --> 00:21:32,250
But sometimes you've
got to wake up, right?

519
00:21:32,333 --> 00:21:33,791
[MADOKA gasps]

520
00:21:33,875 --> 00:21:36,958
Don't act like you
know everything, Money Bags.

521
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:39,333
I'm not letting you
go out on that note.

522
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:41,958
[MADOKA]
Uh... Huh?

523
00:21:42,041 --> 00:21:45,416
Heh. The survival of a video
game company relies solely

524
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:48,041
on an inter-corporate
political marriage?

525
00:21:48,125 --> 00:21:49,541
They make summer blockbusters

526
00:21:49,625 --> 00:21:52,833
about that kind of
crazy situation.

527
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:56,750
And yet, the plot has
only begun to thicken!

528
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,958
[MADOKA] Hey, all,
this is Madoka Kuramochi!

529
00:23:33,041 --> 00:23:35,875
I've never met anyone
like Mr. Kagami before.

530
00:23:35,958 --> 00:23:37,541
That's why he's so attractive.

531
00:23:37,625 --> 00:23:38,666
Next episode,

532
00:23:38,750 --> 00:23:40,958
genius programmer
Hell Gates arrives!

533
00:23:41,041 --> 00:23:42,791
Wait, what's he doing here?

534
00:23:42,875 --> 00:23:45,541
Mr. Kagami, you can't
make a promise like that!

535
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,291
You had better have a plan!

536
00:23:47,375 --> 00:23:50,333
Period Fifteen,
"The Fiancé is a Game King."

537
00:23:50,416 --> 00:23:52,375
You need to take
this seriously!

538
00:23:52,458 --> 00:23:53,750
But I hope you win.

539
00:23:53,833 --> 00:23:56,416
I really don't want to marry
someone I don't love.
