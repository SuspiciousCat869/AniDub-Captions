She's desperate to
go to the concert.

Kanan's parents are super
strict about school,

that I hear your anime voice.

that I hear your voice!

be able to choose?

tell you something was wrong?

complication.

super sensitive about her voice.

we convince her otherwise?

00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,666
like you're not
making much progress.

155
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,000
[JUNICHIRO] No response at all?
Awfully cold of you.

156
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,666
[DOOR VOICE] You must say
the password, gero gero.

157
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,708
Oh, looks like I forgot
to mention something.

158
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:47,625
The doors in the library
have been modified by me.

159
00:09:47,708 --> 00:09:49,166
The locks are voice-activated,

160
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:50,958
but don't worry.
All you have to do is say

161
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,958
Sergeant Saunders' famous
catchphrase and they'll ope--

162
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:04,500
Hm. So there's still some
work to do on this project.

163
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:10,375
Oh, Mrs. Chinami, you don't seem
old enough to have a teenager!

164
00:10:10,458 --> 00:10:11,416
That's kind of
you to say, sir!

165
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,541
It's easy when it's the truth!

166
00:10:12,625 --> 00:10:13,875
Be careful not to
flatter me too much!

167
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:15,000
I didn't think Kanan would
have such a great mom!

168
00:10:15,083 --> 00:10:16,500
Hey, girl! Are you
surprised to see us?

169
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:18,208
We were all waiting for you!

170
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,416
[KANAN'S MOTHER] Kanan,
come sit with your teacher!

171
00:10:21,458 --> 00:10:24,000
If I'd been expecting Kanan's
teacher this afternoon,

172
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:26,458
I would've prepared a
special dinner for all of you!

173
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:28,166
Please, it's my fault,
I assure you.

174
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:30,000
There's no reason
to scold Miss Kanan.

175
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:32,041
I found myself suddenly
overcome with the need

176
00:10:32,125 --> 00:10:34,750
to help this eager student, and
the whole plan was last minute,

177
00:10:34,833 --> 00:10:36,666
so I didn't give her a
chance to prepare you!

178
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,875
Kanan's struggled with
physics for so long.

179
00:10:38,958 --> 00:10:41,000
She's lucky to have
such a dedicated teacher.

180
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,791
With your assistance,
I know she'll rise

181
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:44,125
to the top of her class!

182
00:10:44,208 --> 00:10:45,916
Don't worry--
you can count on me!

183
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,125
I am, after all, the number
one physics teacher.

184
00:10:48,208 --> 00:10:50,583
[KANAN'S MOTHER] How perfectly
charming and dramatic!

185
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,375
[SUZUNE and KANAN'S
MOTHER laugh]

186
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:55,166
We're not gonna abandon you.

187
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:57,541
I anticipated a reaction
like this from you.

188
00:10:57,625 --> 00:10:58,791
Suzune, you're on.

189
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,333
[SUZUNE]
Hm!

190
00:11:01,458 --> 00:11:03,875
Since she's used to speaking
with you, Suzune will translate

191
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,250
so you can let us know
how you really feel.

192
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:09,000
Now, please, go ahead
and let it all out.

193
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,541
"Can you please leave
and get out of my life?

194
00:11:13,625 --> 00:11:16,041
In case you hadn't noticed,
I actually have to study.

195
00:11:16,125 --> 00:11:18,791
I don't want anything to do
with you or your schemes."

196
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,958
[JUNICHIRO] Are you sure
that's what you want?

197
00:11:21,041 --> 00:11:22,500
[SUZUNE hums]

198
00:11:22,583 --> 00:11:25,041
"Neither my fingers nor your
sister's voice stuttered.

199
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:27,708
Besides, why did the two of you
come all the way out here?"

200
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:30,125
Obviously, as a concerned
teacher, it's my duty

201
00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:33,583
to do everything in my power
to improve your test scores.

202
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:34,833
"Say what?"

203
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,458
What we have here is
a cool anime premise.

204
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,208
I'm the hero and your
voice is a McGuffin

205
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:40,500
and just like Sergeant Saunders,

206
00:11:40,583 --> 00:11:43,166
I'll fight through
every last challenge.

207
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:45,166
And just before the
closing credit song begins,

208
00:11:45,250 --> 00:11:46,708
you'll speak to me!

209
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:50,166
"I would never
make that deal!

210
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,833
It doesn't matter
how special you think

211
00:11:51,916 --> 00:11:54,666
my voice might sound because
I will never speak again!"

212
00:11:54,750 --> 00:11:56,500
[JUNICHIRO]
Like I said...

213
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,625
Are you sure that's really how
you want this all to play out?

214
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,500
You're the one who
said you "have to" go

215
00:12:01,583 --> 00:12:03,708
to You Red Pond's
concert, right?

216
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,458
And correct me if I'm wrong,
but didn't you say

217
00:12:05,541 --> 00:12:07,958
you need to get your grades
up in order to do that?

218
00:12:08,041 --> 00:12:10,041
And we all know you can't
possibly accomplish that

219
00:12:10,125 --> 00:12:12,125
without my generous assistance.

220
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,208
All I'm asking for is
that you kindly allow me

221
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:16,416
to hear your precious
voice. No biggie.

222
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,333
So, let's make a deal!

223
00:12:20,708 --> 00:12:22,208
"You talk a pretty big game.

224
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,333
I don't see how it's possible
to make the top ten so fast."

225
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:27,583
[JUNICHIRO] Trust me, my YD
is an asset. It means that

226
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:32,166
when I actually yearn to do
something, I totally deliver.

227
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:34,750
How about this? If I can't
tutor you into the top ten,

228
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:37,833
I will make a solemn
vow to quit. Sound fair?

229
00:12:37,916 --> 00:12:41,333
[SUZUNE gasps]
That's not necessary!

230
00:12:41,416 --> 00:12:43,125
So, whaddaya say?

231
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:50,541
Heh... Huzzah!
Then we have a deal!

232
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,791
I took the liberty of
analyzing all of your grades

233
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:55,708
for every subject
since seventh grade.

234
00:12:55,791 --> 00:12:57,250
It seems that where
your previous teachers

235
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:58,583
failed you is in
your understanding

236
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,250
of quadratic functions
and multipliers.

237
00:13:01,333 --> 00:13:03,250
Naturally, weakness in
those areas would put you

238
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,958
at a disadvantage when studying
wave equations and dynamics,

239
00:13:06,041 --> 00:13:08,416
which ultimately is why your
grades have been going nowhere.

240
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,083
So I built this
especially for you

241
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,833
to work with your shortcomings.

242
00:13:12,916 --> 00:13:14,416
[SUZUNE]
Huh?

243
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:16,250
[JUNICHIRO] Kanan Quest,
the ultra-personalized

244
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:19,791
educational video game
built for your success!

245
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,458
This program calculates
your weaknesses

246
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,208
and creates problems instantly!

247
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:27,416
As your understanding deepens,
the questions intensify.

248
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,375
If you can get past
level 8 in this game,

249
00:13:29,458 --> 00:13:32,583
you should be able to at
least get an 80 on your test.

250
00:14:18,833 --> 00:14:20,500
[JUNICHIRO]
You're stressing too much.

251
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:23,416
Just like any RPG, if you keep
grinding, you'll get stronger.

252
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,375
Those monsters you're facing now
will be trash mobs in no time.

253
00:14:26,458 --> 00:14:29,541
It'll be easy! Huh?

254
00:14:29,625 --> 00:14:33,250
She says it's not easy
for her, but... hmm.

255
00:14:33,333 --> 00:14:34,916
Hm?

256
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,000
Okay. Think I got it.

257
00:14:50,916 --> 00:14:52,083
[knock at the door]

258
00:14:52,166 --> 00:14:54,625
[JUNICHIRO]
I'm coming in.

259
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,625
Here, since you said it was
too hard, I put together

260
00:14:56,708 --> 00:14:59,333
a brand new custom
system overnight.

261
00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,500
[JUNICHIRO] Check out that FMV!
You'd think Square-Enix made it!

262
00:15:09,583 --> 00:15:13,625
Anyway, I call it
Kanan Fantasy 2!

263
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,416
I added a debug function
to help the game

264
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,708
further develop your skills.

265
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:19,166
It analyzes your
weaknesses in order

266
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:22,333
to help you overcome them
with clearer questions.

267
00:15:22,416 --> 00:15:24,291
There's no way your
grades won't improve now!

268
00:15:24,375 --> 00:15:26,500
Also, can you believe
those graphics?

269
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:29,416
Your game is now in high-def 3D,
which adds a level of realism,

270
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:32,166
depth, and complexity to the
physics problems you encounter.

271
00:15:32,250 --> 00:15:34,041
All of which should
encourage thinking--

272
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:36,625
[JUNICHIRO grunts]

273
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:47,458
[JUNICHIRO groans softly]

274
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:50,916
Did I fall asleep or something?
Sorry, I guess I must've been

275
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,750
pretty exhausted after
the last few nights.

276
00:15:57,125 --> 00:16:00,583
Why are you sorry? In the end,
it's my fault that I haven't

277
00:16:00,666 --> 00:16:03,333
been able to teach you
physics effectively enough--

278
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,708
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

279
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:11,291
[JUNICHIRO] You have to
get into the top ten...

280
00:16:11,375 --> 00:16:14,375
Otherwise, it wouldn't
be right to accept that.

281
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,250
As an otaku, I take
pride in making

282
00:16:16,333 --> 00:16:19,458
large payments for
things of true value.

283
00:16:19,541 --> 00:16:21,833
I appreciate the
gesture, though.

284
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,458
[JUNICHIRO] You know,
I only got 5 out of 100

285
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:33,250
on my first physics test.

286
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:36,666
I thought the whole subject was
boring and irrelevant at first,

287
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:39,416
but I had this cool idea
to build an "Anywhere Door."

288
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,416
People told me I could never
make something like that

289
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:43,041
without physics,
so I studied physics

290
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,250
because it was
something I had to do.

291
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,125
I always do what
I "yearn to do,"

292
00:16:47,208 --> 00:16:49,416
but that's not necessarily
what I'm naturally good at,

293
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,958
or even what I can
already accomplish.

294
00:16:52,041 --> 00:16:53,416
In order to realize
a bigger goal,

295
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,416
sometimes I have to do
something I'm bad at.

296
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,708
So in a way,
we're the same.

297
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:12,750
[BOY A] Whoa, that's
a total anime voice!

298
00:17:12,833 --> 00:17:14,750
[BOY B] Is that
really her real voice?

299
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:15,750
Are you sure it's not edited?

300
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,125
[BOY C] This is
godlike! Sort of!

301
00:17:17,208 --> 00:17:20,125
[BOY A] Her voice is
in the 2.5th dimension!

302
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,250
[GIRL A] Wow, Kanan,
you're like super popular!

303
00:17:25,333 --> 00:17:26,583
Look at all the comments!
