fall through the cracks
of manga culture.

Hmm.

I read that manga

I have to admit, it was fun!

After I saw the
Anywhere Door in the manga,

I thought science was boring,

I've got a special ability.

All I have to do
is watch something once,

Yomi sure was
right about you.

You wanna tell me
who this person is or--uuh!

203

Perhaps the

[JUNICHIRO] So this

is your secret agent, Options?

But you fired me.
What's the point in all this?

I know she likes
trolling people,

this is a bit elaborate.

[KOYOMI chuckles]

220
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:54,916
[JUNICHIRO] So what does
Options want from you?

221
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,625
What does she want from me?

222
00:11:56,708 --> 00:12:00,166
For what devious purpose
did she send you here?

223
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:04,041
What purpose?
None that I know of.

224
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,791
Huh? But...

225
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,416
I mean, I'm just here
because she told me to come.

226
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,125
I know that. What I'm asking is

227
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:11,666
why she had you come
in the first place!

228
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:13,666
It sure worked out, though!

229
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:16,083
Yomi always talks about
things being "amusing,"

230
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,416
but I never really knew
what she meant.

231
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:22,208
But now that I've met you,
I get it, loud and clear.

00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:25,333
I feel like my heart
could leap out of my chest!

00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:28,458
I'm lighter than air!

Also, get off me!

Oh, by the way,
I want some more manga!

That series is an exception.

with me everywhere I go!

I lived in a sanitarium

It was a big, white building--

[REIKO] "Amusing"?
What do you mean by that?

320
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:25,500
I know a certain someone
who happens to be

321
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:28,250
an expert in the field.

322
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,083
If you become
a student at my school

323
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:34,333
I could introduce you.
It's not a bad deal.

324
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:39,166
I can't. I've never
left this place, even once.

[KOYOMI]
I can help you break free.

00:16:41,625 --> 00:16:44,500
If that is what
you desire, of course.

[giggles]

328
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,208
I was a little scared,
but I felt like if I said no,

329
00:16:49,291 --> 00:16:51,333
I'd be in that place
bored forever.

330
00:16:51,416 --> 00:16:53,583
Then yesterday,
Yomi contacted me and said

331
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:56,916
to come here. She said
I'd be an intern for a day.

332
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,041
She promised if I did that
then I'd get to meet you.

333
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:02,541
[JUNICHIRO] Wow, Options
really went out of her way

334
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:03,875
to make this happen.

335
00:17:03,958 --> 00:17:06,500
Anyway, I'm super glad
I listened to her.

336
00:17:06,583 --> 00:17:09,125
Because now
I can learn how to have fun,

337
00:17:09,208 --> 00:17:10,958
just like I learned
everything else!

338
00:17:11,041 --> 00:17:14,500
So, whatever The Master says,
I'll do for sure!

339
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:18,875
In that case,
go back to your room.

340
00:17:18,958 --> 00:17:20,791
Huh? But I still
need to learn--

341
00:17:20,875 --> 00:17:24,708
You said you'd do whatever The
Master told you, if I recall.

342
00:17:29,458 --> 00:17:33,958
Okay. If that's
what you want, then I'll go.

be ashamed, Junichiro.

Making a little girl
cry like that.

347
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,333
[JUNICHIRO]
It's a lesson.

348
00:17:46,416 --> 00:17:48,375
She's smart, but there's
an important part

349
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,625
of having fun
she doesn't understand yet.

Did I make him mad?

351
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:02,458
What did I say? I did
everything he told me to.

352
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:06,208
Maybe he hates me now that
he knows why I'm really here.

353
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,666
Wait, it can't be 'cause I
didn't finish my food, right?

354
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:15,250
If he won't teach me,
I might never have fun again.

355
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:18,958
Everything will be boring,
just like before.

In that case,
go back to your room.

that means I'm not

368
00:18:51,125 --> 00:18:55,125
following his instructions
