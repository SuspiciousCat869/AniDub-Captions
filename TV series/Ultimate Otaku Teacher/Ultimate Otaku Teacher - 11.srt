me, but especially not that guy.

161
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:53,291
What? Are you malfunctioning?

162
00:08:53,375 --> 00:08:55,500
He treats you as
an equal, though.

163
00:08:55,583 --> 00:08:59,791
So if I lose to you, that also
means I'm losing to him.

164
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,750
[LUCE sighs]

165
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,458
[LUCE]
He's so honest...

166
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:07,833
He's not afraid to say anything.
I wish I could be like that...

167
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,708
Listening to him...

168
00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:12,500
...I feel like my
whole life is a lie.

169
00:09:12,583 --> 00:09:13,875
[SEIJURO]
Anyway...

170
00:09:13,958 --> 00:09:16,250
I think I've embarrassed
myself enough for one day,

171
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:18,458
so I'm outta here.

172
00:09:18,541 --> 00:09:19,916
Hmm?

173
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:31,291
[LUCE]
Can we meet again sometime...?

174
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,958
[LUCE]
What am I saying?!

175
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,291
If I keep talking to him,

176
00:09:34,375 --> 00:09:36,750
he's gonna find out
my secret for sure.

177
00:09:38,666 --> 00:09:41,000
[LUCE]
But I feel like he's different.

178
00:09:41,083 --> 00:09:42,916
Maybe I can be honest with him.

179
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:46,708
Fine. Don't gotta get
all grabby about it.

180
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:48,833
[LUCE] I think if I
tell him who I really am

181
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:53,000
he'll keep my secret.
Or at least he won't laugh.

182
00:09:53,083 --> 00:09:54,458
Hold on!

183
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,666
[SEIJURO gasps]

184
00:10:07,541 --> 00:10:08,916
[LUCE whimpers]

185
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:17,666
Listen... I'm...

186
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:20,416
...Koutaro Araki,
the truant from your class!

187
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:27,625
[gasps] You, uh, you aren't
weirded out or anything?

188
00:10:27,708 --> 00:10:30,916
Nah. Not really my business
what you do offline.

189
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,166
As far as I'm concerned,
you're still Luce,

190
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,041
you're still Otaku
Teacher's partner,

191
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:36,333
so I'm still gonna beat ya.

192
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,916
[gasps]

193
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,041
[SEIJURO] I mean, whatever, but
you didn't need to tell me that.

194
00:10:41,125 --> 00:10:45,375
Talking about offline stuff is
bad, uh, "netiquette," right?

195
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,333
[LUCE]
Yeah, sorry.

196
00:10:47,416 --> 00:10:48,416
[SEIJURO]
Gotta admit.

197
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,250
That was pretty brave
of you, though.

198
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:51,583
[LUCE]
Don't tell the others, okay?

199
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:53,083
[SEIJURO]
No problem.

200
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,541
[sighs]

201
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,541
So that's it.

202
00:11:06,458 --> 00:11:08,625
[yawns]

203
00:11:08,708 --> 00:11:09,666
[KISAKI]
Junichiro!

204
00:11:09,750 --> 00:11:11,125
Huh?

205
00:11:11,208 --> 00:11:12,208
[JUNICHIRO groans]

206
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,625
I need to talk to you
for a second.

207
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,541
So, yeah, it's kinda crazy that

208
00:11:16,625 --> 00:11:18,500
Luce was Koutaro
all this time, huh?

209
00:11:18,583 --> 00:11:20,916
[JUNICHIRO]
What? And who told you that?

210
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:25,291
[KISAKI chuckles] I saw you
egging on Seijuro the other day.

211
00:11:28,875 --> 00:11:31,291
[KISAKI] I got curious,
so when I saw him log in,

212
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:35,458
I did the same and followed
his character around in secret.

213
00:11:35,541 --> 00:11:37,750
After a while, I overheard Luce,

214
00:11:37,833 --> 00:11:41,208
or rather, Koutaro tell
Seijuro who he actually is.

215
00:11:41,291 --> 00:11:43,333
I see. Well, good for him.

216
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:45,208
I didn't think he would
tell anyone on his own.

217
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:47,541
I wouldn't celebrate, since
he still wants to keep it

218
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,041
a secret from everyone else.

219
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,416
[chuckles]

220
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,041
Oh, jeez... What plot
are you hatching this time?

221
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,250
Not a thing,
thank you very much!

222
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,791
I'm waiting for him
to make a move.

223
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,625
You can't win a game
by doing nothing,

224
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,041
and if someone else
wins it for you,

225
00:12:02,125 --> 00:12:04,083
then you haven't
accomplished anything.

226
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:06,916
Life is the same way.
The point is,

227
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:10,750
whether he wants to move forward
or not is all up to him.

228
00:12:10,833 --> 00:12:12,458
Huh. I guess so.

229
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:16,375
Well, I can say at least one
thing about our dear Koutaro.

230
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,208
He sure has
grabbed my attention.

231
00:12:19,291 --> 00:12:20,750
[JUNICHIRO]
And just like games,

232
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,875
no matter how well you have
things lined up in your life,

233
00:12:22,958 --> 00:12:25,500
there's always something
to keep you on your toes.

234
00:12:25,583 --> 00:12:26,916
But I'm not complaining.

235
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,958
That's what keeps
things interesting.

236
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:37,250
[LUCE] I wonder if
he's coming or not...

237
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,375
Seijuro?

238
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:46,875
[KISAKI] Sorry to disappoint,
but it's just me.

239
00:12:47,958 --> 00:12:49,500
[KISAKI]
Let's talk, Koutaro.

240
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:52,250
[gasps]
So you know...

241
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,916
Who told you?
Please don't tell me it was...

242
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:59,041
It wasn't Seijuro. No need
to jump to conclusions, okay?

243
00:12:59,125 --> 00:13:00,666
I did happen to overhear your

244
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:02,416
secret confession
to him, though.

245
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:04,083
[gasps]

246
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,916
[KISAKI] Do you think
we could meet in person?

247
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,250
Huh?

248
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,291
There's no way to say this
and not sound creepy,

249
00:13:09,375 --> 00:13:10,666
but I'm outside your house.

250
00:13:13,791 --> 00:13:16,666
You are. Hello there.

251
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,500
It's me.

252
00:13:17,583 --> 00:13:19,125
That's so cool!

253
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:22,000
You're just as pretty in real
life as you are in Uroboros!

254
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,458
[LUCE gasps]

255
00:13:24,666 --> 00:13:26,291
Uh, thank you?

256
00:13:26,375 --> 00:13:27,916
[KISAKI]
I'm inspired!

257
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,625
I love it!

258
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,791
[LUCE] Uh...

259
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:31,875
If you don't have
anything to talk about,

260
00:13:31,958 --> 00:13:33,750
could you please leave...?

261
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,208
[growls]

262
00:13:36,708 --> 00:13:38,583
[KISAKI]
But that outfit of yours...

263
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:41,750
It's not doing anything for me.

264
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:44,708
I know you aren't busy,
so let's go shopping!

265
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:46,458

Huh? No, wait!

00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:19,416
Whoa! Wow, cute!
Is she, like, a model?

268
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:20,958
[MALE A]
Maybe an actress?

269
00:14:23,625 --> 00:14:24,833
Perfect!

270
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,875
That's just the look for you!

So, hey...

274
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:35,875
What do you say you and I make
a stop by the school real quick?

275
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,458
Huh?

276
00:14:37,541 --> 00:14:39,541
I bet Seijuro's still practicing
with the soccer team right now.

277
00:14:39,625 --> 00:14:41,000
Let's give him a
surprise and show him

how stupidly cute you are!

00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:44,166
I can't.

280
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:46,291
Going to school is too much.

281

[giggles]

282
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,791
[KISAKI]
A beautiful struggle...

283
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,625
The wall between
fear and acceptance!

284
00:14:51,708 --> 00:14:54,958
A face colored in conflict,
wonderful conflict!

My blood is boiling! I'm
heating up like never before!

You're... scaring me...

00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:05,583
Let me tell you a secret.

290
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,708
Till recently, I wouldn't
go to school, either.

Is that really true?

So come with me and let's
vanquish that fear of yours!

No... I'd rather not.

Gotta hand it to you.
That was a nice save.

I thought I would escort you
to the school personally.

you had the truant with you.

00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,375
[gasps]
Yeah.

319
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,625
Hey, would you like to
stop by my place first?

320
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,333
Don't worry, it's real close.

321
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,666
What a dump!

322
00:16:21,750 --> 00:16:23,333
You really should try
to fix this place up.

323
00:16:23,416 --> 00:16:24,666
Yeah, well who asked you?!

324
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:27,333
In fact, you weren't even
invited, if I recall!

325
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,166
[KAZUYA]
I'm home!

326
00:16:30,250 --> 00:16:31,583
[MAKINA]
Welcome back!

327
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:34,541
Oh wait. That's weird.
You're home pretty early today.

328
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:36,291
It's a long story.

329
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:38,000
[KAZUYA]
Oh, hey!

330
00:16:38,083 --> 00:16:39,833
Hi! Nice to meet you.

331
00:16:39,916 --> 00:16:41,250
Are these your friends?

332
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:42,416
'Fraid not.

333
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:44,041
I'm sure she's too
embarrassed to tell you,

334
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,625
but your sister has no friends.

335
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,958
Excuse you! Don't fill my
brother's head with weird ideas!

336
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,625
Now wash your hands
for dinner, okay?

337
00:16:51,708 --> 00:16:53,083
'Kay!

338
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:55,791
How cute.

339
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,500
And do you always cook for him?

340
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,125
[MAKINA]
Yeah, usually.

341
00:16:59,208 --> 00:17:01,250
Our parents don't get home
from work until late.

342
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,583
So it's up to me to throw
together something.

343
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:05,416
I tend to get back a
bit late myself,

344
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,583
thanks to student council,

345
00:17:06,666 --> 00:17:09,041
so he ends up staying
home alone a lot.

346
00:17:09,125 --> 00:17:12,958
I'm glad I didn't have to keep
him waiting so long for once.

347
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,625
Here.

348
00:17:14,708 --> 00:17:18,291
Nothing too fancy, I'm afraid,
but a free meal is a free meal.

349
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:19,666
Huh...?

350
00:17:19,750 --> 00:17:21,500
[KISAKI "Nothing too fancy"
is an understatement.

351
00:17:21,583 --> 00:17:25,000
Don't be a jerk!
Nobody's forcing you to eat it!

352
00:17:30,208 --> 00:17:31,375
[KIRIKO]
Welcome home, Master.

353
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:33,750
How may I serve you?

354
00:17:33,833 --> 00:17:35,583
[gasps]
Mr. Kagami!

355
00:17:35,666 --> 00:17:38,041
Hey! You have a second?

356
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,416
I need some info
from you, Potatoes.

357
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,708
Huh? What do you need to know?

358
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:44,375
Okay, I've got their
e-mail addresses

359
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:46,000
and phone numbers here.

360
00:17:46,083 --> 00:17:47,250
[JUNICHIRO]
Arigato!

361
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:49,750
I'm curious about what
you're planning, though.

362
00:17:49,833 --> 00:17:51,458
Well, let's just
say I'm throwing

363
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,583
a little surprise
together. See ya!

364
00:17:53,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Uh... A surprise?

365
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,291
[KISAKI]
Pass the ketchup.

366
00:17:58,375 --> 00:18:00,291
Ugh. Don't be gross!

367
00:18:00,375 --> 00:18:02,541
You're supposed to
use soy sauce on this.

368
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,500
Don't invalidate my
condiment preference

369
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:06,291
with your judgmental attitude.

370
00:18:06,375 --> 00:18:08,625
If you choose to live
a soy sauce lifestyle,

371
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,083
then I won't
fault you for that,

372
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,666
but I'm a ketchup girl,
through and through.

373
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:13,541
[MAKINA]
Okay, okay. I get it.

374
00:18:14,791 --> 00:18:16,125
[MAKINA]
Here!

375
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:18,375
Oh, lemme try some, too!

376
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,708
[MAKINA] That's fine, but don't
stand up in your chair!

377
00:18:20,791 --> 00:18:22,541
[KAZUYA]
Okay!

378
00:18:22,625 --> 00:18:25,375
What's wrong?
Do you not like the food?

379
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:26,833
[LUCE]
Oh, no.

380
00:18:26,916 --> 00:18:29,541
You can eat anything if you
put enough ketchup on it.

381
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,000
What are you implying?!

382
00:18:31,083 --> 00:18:34,041
The food is fine.
It's me, really.

383
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,583
I didn't mean to be rude.

384
00:18:35,666 --> 00:18:38,208
I just haven't had dinner with
other people in a long time.

385
00:18:39,291 --> 00:18:42,625
[LUCE] My mom cooks me food,
but I eat it alone in my room.

386
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,000
I hardly see my parents at all.

387
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,333
Well, you're free to come here,

388
00:18:49,416 --> 00:18:52,000
but I think it's better to
do it with your own family.

389
00:18:52,083 --> 00:18:53,333
Have some juice.

390
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,458
[LUCE]
Oh, uh, thanks.

391
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,625
I'm sorry if this is a
weird thing to ask,

392
00:18:57,708 --> 00:19:00,125
but... why are you
being so nice to me?

393
00:19:00,208 --> 00:19:01,708
Huh?

394
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:04,375
I only just met you, and you're
already cooking dinner for me.

395
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,375
Well, sure.

396
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:09,125
I mean, I don't have to
have a reason to be nice.

397
00:19:09,208 --> 00:19:12,083
I felt like it.
That's all I can say!

398
00:19:12,166 --> 00:19:14,333
There's no need to be shy.

399
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,291
Thanks for the meal, Sis!

400
00:19:18,125 --> 00:19:21,416
Don't think about it too much.
She's just crazy like that.

401
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:22,958
Huh?

402
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:25,291
Like how you're crazy about
games, or I'm crazy about manga.

403
00:19:25,375 --> 00:19:26,666
That kind of thing.

404
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,250
I don't get it, but she
really is nuts about school

405
00:19:29,333 --> 00:19:32,125
and thinks everyone else
should feel the same way.

406
00:19:32,208 --> 00:19:34,000
So even if she's
pushy and pokes her nose

407
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,708
into our business,
she's only doing it

408
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:37,333
because she wants
us to be happy.

409
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:39,875
'Cause even if she seems grumpy,
I know she loves her job

410
00:19:39,958 --> 00:19:42,750
and loves taking care
of the other students.

411
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:44,583
[JUNICHIRO]
So that's the deal.

412
00:19:44,666 --> 00:19:46,500
Anyway, it'd be great if
you guys could show up

413
00:19:46,583 --> 00:19:47,791
at the party, too.

414
00:19:47,875 --> 00:19:50,541
[SUZUNE]
Hm? What party?

415
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:52,625
[JUNICHIRO] Yeah, there's gonna
be tons of interesting people,

416
00:19:52,708 --> 00:19:56,750
I promise. You won't be bored,
I'll tell you that much.

417
00:19:56,833 --> 00:20:00,416
Okay, I'll see you soon. Bring
the other two for me, okay?

418
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:01,666
See ya!

419
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:02,458
What's up?

420
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,291
So, you're having a party?

421
00:20:04,375 --> 00:20:06,458
Huh? [sighs]

422
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:09,041
More or less.
I'll see you later.

423
00:20:10,083 --> 00:20:12,083
[SUZUNE]
Hm?

424
00:20:12,166 --> 00:20:14,541
You're going to meet the person
you were talking to?

425
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,458
[JUNICHIRO]
Yeah.

426
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:16,541
Who is it?

427
00:20:16,625 --> 00:20:18,000
[JUNICHIRO]
A friend.

428
00:20:20,583 --> 00:20:22,333
[MAKINA] I'm sorry
I can't walk you home,

429
00:20:22,416 --> 00:20:24,625
but I need to make sure
Kazuya gets to bed on time.

430
00:20:24,708 --> 00:20:28,000
Oh no! it's fine.
Thank you for everything.

431
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:30,125
See you later, loser.

432
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:31,250
Nice meeting you.

433
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,291
Uh... Hey, Koutaro, wait.

434
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:35,541
[gasps]

435
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
I know coming to school
may be a little bit much

436
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:38,333
for you right now.

437
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:40,166
But if you ever do
feel like going,

438
00:20:40,250 --> 00:20:42,333
give me and Sachiko
a call, okay?

439
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:44,458
I'll give you the grand tour.

440
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:47,666
[MAKINA]
And listen...

441
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:49,916
Whether you decide
to go to class or not,

442
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,208
you're welcome to
come see me here.

443
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,750
You're the best.
I can't thank you enough.

444
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,666
[giggles]

445
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:03,000
[KISAKI]
Okay, let's go!

446
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,250
Better take you home
before it gets too late.

447
00:21:05,333 --> 00:21:07,208
See you later, Sachiko.

448
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:11,958
[LUCE]
Seijuro...

449
00:21:12,041 --> 00:21:14,333
Kisaki...

450
00:21:14,416 --> 00:21:16,291
Makina...

451
00:21:16,375 --> 00:21:19,000
They don't care how
I dress or how I act.

452
00:21:19,083 --> 00:21:21,500
They just treat me like
one of their friends.

453
00:21:21,583 --> 00:21:23,708
It's no different
than playing online.

454
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:26,166
Huh? Something wrong?

455
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,041
[LUCE]
Hm. Not a thing!

456
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:30,375
[LUCE]
If I went to school...

457
00:21:30,458 --> 00:21:33,458
I wonder if I could
meet more people like them.

458
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,708
Here we go.

459
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:38,708
[snaps]

460
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,666
It's time to start the lesson!

461
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:42,083
[SATOSHI, KOUSUKE,
MAMORU chuckling]

462
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,125
[JUNICHIRO] Hey, guys.
Sorry to call you up so late.

463
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:47,083
[JUNICHIRO]
This won't be easy.

464
00:21:47,166 --> 00:21:49,041
But if you can't
pass this lesson,

465
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:52,000
you'll never be able
to come back to reality.

466
00:21:53,458 --> 00:21:54,875
So about the party...

467
00:21:54,958 --> 00:21:56,208
...you guys in?

468
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:33,208
[LUCE]
This is the Ironclad Nun, Luce.

469
00:23:33,291 --> 00:23:36,250
Kisaki and Makina discovered
my secret, but it turns out

470
00:23:36,333 --> 00:23:39,750
they were really nice people and
didn't think I was weird at all.

471
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:43,125
Next episode, I work up the
courage to attend a class party,

472
00:23:43,208 --> 00:23:44,833
but there are some
surprise guests there

473
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:47,666
I'm not really ready for.
I've come this far.

474
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,000
I have to do something.

475
00:23:50,083 --> 00:23:52,833
Period twelve,
"Luce vs. The First."

476
00:23:52,916 --> 00:23:55,791
This is my fight.
It's now or never!
