She's an intern at KEC labs
with the ability

to learn anything after
only watching it once.

00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,541
Anyway, she was locked up in
some weird institution for ages,

00:05:23,625 --> 00:05:25,708
so she needs me to
teach her what "fun" is.

If you really want to
have fun, you gotta learn

to always follow your heart,
no matter what!

00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:16,708
It's your fault.
You shouldn't try to stop me!

161
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:20,583
You said it yourself. I can't
let anyone boss me around!

162
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:23,916
Don't freak out.
Who said I'm here to stop you?

163
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,375
Huh?

164
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:27,708
Stomp me!

165
00:09:27,791 --> 00:09:28,833
What?

166
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,666
Get over here and step on me!

167
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,083
Whatever you say!
I'll do my best!

168
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:39,500
Junichiro, open up! Come on!
It's not funny! Do it!

169
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:41,500
Open this gate now!

170
00:09:41,583 --> 00:09:43,041
You must forgive me, Yamato,

171
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,958
but The Master
has been defeated!

172
00:09:46,041 --> 00:09:47,125
[YAMATO]
Huh?

173
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,208
[JUNICHIRO]
She must've been training

174
00:09:48,291 --> 00:09:49,708
in the hyperbolic time chamber,

175
00:09:49,791 --> 00:09:51,958
'cause her martial arts
are super effective!

176
00:09:52,041 --> 00:09:53,125
Hyperbolic?

177
00:09:53,208 --> 00:09:55,125
I don't get the reference.

178
00:09:55,208 --> 00:09:57,083
[YAMATO]
Oh right. I forgot.

179
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:59,583
This is Junichiro
we're dealing with.

180
00:10:02,041 --> 00:10:04,291
Thank you, but why
are you doing this?

181
00:10:04,375 --> 00:10:06,875
[JUNICHIRO]
It's obvious, isn't it?

182
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:09,250
'Cause siding with a bunch
of scientists is boring,

183
00:10:09,333 --> 00:10:11,375
but siding
with you is super fun!

184
00:10:11,458 --> 00:10:13,125
That's your reason?

185
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,458
Here I was being so serious.

186
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:19,208
[JUNICHIRO]
Barricading yourself in a lab?

187
00:10:19,291 --> 00:10:22,833
C'mon, that's awesome.
I gotta get in on that action.

188
00:10:22,916 --> 00:10:24,541
Okay, but it's not fair.

189
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:27,041
I had to do this so they
wouldn't take me away.

190
00:10:27,125 --> 00:10:29,833
But it's like you get to
have fun wherever you go.

191
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:32,875
[JUNICHIRO] That's right.
Because I have YD,

192
00:10:32,958 --> 00:10:35,333
so if I don't like it,
I can't do it.

193
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:37,625
Man. That sounds
like cheating.

194
00:10:37,708 --> 00:10:40,458
It's not cheating. You can do
the same thing if you like.

195
00:10:40,541 --> 00:10:43,250
And whether you do it
at school or not is up to you.

196
00:10:43,333 --> 00:10:45,916
I thought I wanted
to work at this lab.

197
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,833
But maybe there's
something bigger than that.

198
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:53,000
Did Junichiro
convince her to come out?

199
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:56,958
What I want. What I want
is to live like The Master.

200
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,750
Oh yeah? Are you sure?

201
00:10:58,833 --> 00:11:01,166
[REIKO] Yes, I'll be
just like The Master.

202
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:03,416
But I'll find my own fun.

203
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,875
At school, with everyone else.

204
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:12,208
And once I find it,
I'll never let go!

205
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:27,541
[REIKO] I won't fight you, Yomi.
I'm ready to go to school now.

206
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:29,875
Oh? And you're certain?

207
00:11:29,958 --> 00:11:31,791
Yes.

208
00:11:31,875 --> 00:11:34,041
You don't even need
Mr. Kagami to come along

209
00:11:34,125 --> 00:11:35,333
and teach you?

210
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:36,875
[REIKO]
Mnn-mmm.

211
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:41,541
No. 'Cause his "fun" isn't at
school. It's here.

212
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:45,125
I'm ready. The Master's
already taught me

213
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:48,166
everything I need to know.
The rest is up to me.

214
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:53,583
And may I assume that
Mr. Kagami approves of this?

215
00:11:53,666 --> 00:11:57,833
[JUNICHIRO]
My "fun" is here? I guess so.

216
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,375
Was working on
the Anywhere Door

217
00:11:59,458 --> 00:12:01,583
with everyone really fun or not?

218
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:03,083
I never thought about it.

219
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:05,833
I've been waiting for this day!

220
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:09,208
[laughs]

221
00:12:09,291 --> 00:12:10,666
I wish.

222
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:13,083
But when Reiko
stopped following my orders

223
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:18,500
to do what she wanted, I felt
something. Something familiar.

224
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,583
And then again,
when she took over the lab

225
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,541
because she didn't want to
go back to her old life

226
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:25,166
no matter what. There it was.

227
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:28,333
That spark.
That little light.

228
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:31,083
[KIRIKO]
Cut! Cut! Cut!

229
00:12:32,708 --> 00:12:34,708
Hell yeah!

230
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:37,625
[laughs]

231
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:40,750
Nice to meet you.
You can call me Koutaro.

232
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:43,375
I look forward to
studying with you.

233
00:12:43,458 --> 00:12:46,250
[JUNICHIRO]
Not just a spark, a crack too.

234
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,333
The sound of someone
emerging from their shell

235
00:12:48,416 --> 00:12:50,291
a better, stronger character.

236
00:12:50,375 --> 00:12:52,583
[TIM] I've got one little
question to trouble you with.

237
00:12:52,666 --> 00:12:55,291
Are you still
masquerading as a teacher?

238
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:57,958
Don't act daft, we both
know what I'm talking about.

239
00:12:58,041 --> 00:13:01,000
You do not truly yearn
to be an educator.

240
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:03,958
I mean, you've gotta
find teaching boring.

241
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:05,500
[JUNICHIRO]
It's not about teaching.

242
00:13:05,583 --> 00:13:07,833
It's about creating
a new, better future.

243
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:09,791
Making dreams
and fantasy a reality,

244
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,291
like I've always yearned to do.

245
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,458
I get it now.
Thank you, Options.

246
00:13:15,541 --> 00:13:19,708
I finally understand
what my role is as a teacher.

247
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:21,791
Are you ready
to take me back now?

248
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:22,875
[gasps]

249
00:13:22,958 --> 00:13:23,958
[gasps]

250
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:26,125
Fair warning.
If I have my way,

251
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:28,291
I might make your
whole school obsolete.

252
00:13:28,375 --> 00:13:30,125
What do you mean by that?

253
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,708
Let's call it
sudden inspiration.

254
00:13:32,791 --> 00:13:34,791
You can do the same thing,
and whether you do it

255
00:13:34,875 --> 00:13:36,958
at school or not is up to you.

256
00:13:37,041 --> 00:13:40,000
I'm gonna make every
student want to quit school.

257
00:13:40,083 --> 00:13:41,291
[KOYOMI]
Huh?

258
00:13:41,375 --> 00:13:43,625
That's my new
educational policy.

259
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,291
I'll make them find something
so amazing in their lives

260
00:13:46,375 --> 00:13:48,083
school will become meaningless.

261
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,458
Soon, they'll all
be infected with YD.

262
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:52,750
Yearning to reach their dream.

263
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,750
[KOYOMI]
Splendidly amusing!

264
00:13:54,833 --> 00:13:56,916
That is precisely
the kind of teacher I want.

265
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:58,875
You so rarely disappoint!

266
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:00,916
You are now reinstated.

267
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,875
I trust you will proceed
with your full enthusiasm?

268
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,166
Heh. Of course!
I'm definitely going all-in!

269
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,750
Sorry Yamato.
It just wasn't meant to be.

270
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,916
Duty calls.

271
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,041
Oh, Junichiro.

272
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:15,291
Heh.

273
00:14:15,375 --> 00:14:17,791
I should've seen this coming.
Go ahead, then.

274
00:14:17,875 --> 00:14:21,583
But, listen, if I have another
emergency, I'm calling you--

275
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:27,500
[JUNICHIRO]
Thank you.

276
00:14:27,583 --> 00:14:29,875
You've helped me
more than you know.

277
00:14:30,916 --> 00:14:31,875
[JUNICHIRO chuckles]

278
00:14:31,958 --> 00:14:33,791
Hope that science
stuff works out!

279
00:14:33,875 --> 00:14:37,000
Just YD me
and then fly away, huh?

280
00:14:56,791 --> 00:14:58,583
[JUNICHIRO] You had me dancing
in the palm of your hand

281
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:01,958
this whole time, didn't you?
You really love to meddle.

282
00:15:02,041 --> 00:15:05,416
My! What do you mean?

283
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:07,708
All this mess just to
help me figure out

284
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,791
what it means
to be a teacher.

285
00:15:09,875 --> 00:15:11,916
You sure are thorough.

286
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:15,291
You knew Yamato
wanted me to work at KEC,

287
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:19,125
so you fired me, confident that
I would go check out their lab.

288
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,250
Then you sent Reiko,
a would-be student,

289
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,458
who needed to learn
the concept of "fun."

290
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:25,541
Something I'm
an expert at, of course.

291
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,458
You even told Tim
I was working there

292
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:29,750
because every story
needs a villain.

293
00:15:29,833 --> 00:15:31,375
Then I give one of
my famous lessons

294
00:15:31,458 --> 00:15:33,041
and I'm back to being a teacher.

295
00:15:33,125 --> 00:15:35,958
[KOYOMI] So you say, but you're
the one who got schooled.

296
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:39,000
Well, it's not like it matters.

297
00:15:39,083 --> 00:15:42,208
Once I have my way, you might
want to fire me for real.

298
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,208
Hey, I'm home.
Not like anyone is here.

299
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:55,833
[JUNICHIRO]
Hey, welcome back.

300
00:15:55,916 --> 00:15:58,333
"Welcome back"?
Wait, for real?

301
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,000
You're alive!
What the hell, bro?

302
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:02,291
You disappear for days

303
00:16:02,375 --> 00:16:04,000
and couldn't bother
to return a call?

304
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:06,291
[JUNICHIRO]
Whoa, happy times, happy times!

305
00:16:06,375 --> 00:16:07,500
You're a grownup!

306
00:16:07,583 --> 00:16:10,416
I shouldn't have to
worry about you so much!

307
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,208
[sobs]

308
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,708
I'm sorry.

309
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,416
[SUZUNE] Okay then! I have
a test to study for tomorrow.

310
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:19,416
I wouldn't bother,
if I were you.

311
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,000
How rude!
You saying I'm stu--?

312
00:16:24,166 --> 00:16:25,875
He's gone.

313
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:34,916
[KANAN grunting]

314
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,000
[KANAN] I know
I'm just a lunchtime DJ,

315
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:40,083
and that's not even really
a thing, but someday

316
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,291
people are gonna
hear this doofy anime voice

317
00:16:42,375 --> 00:16:43,791
on national television!

318
00:16:43,875 --> 00:16:46,208
And when You Red Pond
comes to Japan,

319
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,666
it's gonna be me
interviewing her live!

320
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,291
That's right, anime voice,

321
00:16:50,375 --> 00:16:53,041
you and me are
going all the way!

It's so late!
What am I doing?

I have to study
for that test tomorrow!

324
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:59,750
[KANAN] I already know what
university I want to go to,

325
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,333
so it feels
like a waste studying

326
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:03,083
all this stuff I'll never use.

327
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,666
But, if I let my GPA slip,

328
00:17:04,750 --> 00:17:08,125
I'll get stuck being
a dumb voice actor.

if you've brought

At this rate, tests and teachers
will both become obsolete!

344

You're referring to
Mr. Kagami's class, I presume?

I wish! No, it's every

--[KOYOMI] Oh my.
--[MAKINA] Look!

349

In other words,
Mr. Kagami has used this app

350
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:01,083
to extend his grimy paws
to the entire student body!

351
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,500
It's this
"Routine Buster" thing?

352
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,833
Hey kids, if you want to kick
all your exams to the curb,

353
00:18:08,916 --> 00:18:10,750
then this
is the app for you!

354
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:12,291
That is adorable!

00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:14,750
[MAKINA] That is not the issue!
Please, pay attention!

356
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,833
The Routine Buster
is an exam questions

357
00:18:16,916 --> 00:18:19,125
prediction program
for all Icho students.

358

Enter the subject,
teacher name, and test date

359
00:18:21,458 --> 00:18:23,083
to get the
questions and answers

360
00:18:23,166 --> 00:18:25,375
faster than you can say
"studying sucks."

361
00:18:25,458 --> 00:18:27,708
The program relies
on records of previous exams

362
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:29,625
as well as personal data
on the teachers

363
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,666
in order to create a prediction
with 90% accuracy.

364
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:34,125
We'll have to come up
with a new approach

365
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:35,541
when we write out our tests.

366
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,166
And teachers, I know
what you're thinking:

367
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:38,916
"we'll have to come up
with a new approach!"

368
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:40,833
but that only enhances
the richness

369
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,416
of the data in our system!

370
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,666
I've never been so
out-nerded in my life!

371

If I could
reach inside this phone,

I would wring your scrawny

[KOYOMI] Mhm. You've thrown
down the gauntlet.

374
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:53,916
Well, I hired
you for a reason.

Are you studying
for your future?

Or has school
become nothing more

391

Whoa. This is pretty
extreme, even for him.

[JUNICHIRO] Until today,
you had to study things

398
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,166
that had nothing
to do with your future,

399
00:19:41,250 --> 00:19:43,041
because you need to
pass to the next grade,

400
00:19:43,125 --> 00:19:44,958
or improve your GPA,
or maintain whatever

arbitrary standard they value
in the school system.

These things you study
you won't use.

You'll waste hours of
your life memorizing nonsense

as soon as the test is over.

But let me be frank.

408
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,958
The school takes no
responsibility for your future.

409
00:20:06,041 --> 00:20:08,833
The only one
who can do that is you.

410
00:20:08,916 --> 00:20:10,375
You're all free.

411
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:12,750
So find out what it is
you want in this world.

You can go wherever
you please on your own!
