Why the increased caution?

all over the grid,

It's in Akihabara.

473
00:21:05,583 --> 00:21:07,333
Have you heard of it?

474
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:10,208
[JUNICHIRO grunts]
Hmm...

475
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,416
Pick up your stuff
and get back to class.

476
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,625
You're not expelled,

477
00:21:13,708 --> 00:21:15,791
no matter what this
twin-tailed weirdo says.

478
00:21:15,875 --> 00:21:18,791
Excuse me, but you have
no authority on the subject!

479
00:21:18,875 --> 00:21:21,083
And what do you mean
by "twin-tailed weirdo?"

480
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:23,625
[JUNICHIRO] Actually,
I have every authority.

481
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:27,000
[KIRIKO]
Uhh...

482
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,750
[JUNICHIRO]
Effective immediately,

483
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,041
I'm a teacher at this school.

484
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,708
[ALL gasp]

485
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:36,875
[KOYOMI laughs]

486
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,500
[JUNICHIRO] If you
disrespect maid cafés,

487
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,625
then you fail as head
of the student council,

488
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,333
Twin-Tailed Weirdo.

489
00:21:42,416 --> 00:21:45,416
Those two things aren't
even a little bit related.

490
00:21:45,500 --> 00:21:46,541
There's something called

491
00:21:46,625 --> 00:21:48,791
"maid dignity" and
I'm gonna show you.

492
00:21:48,875 --> 00:21:50,916
Prepare yourself for
your first lesson.

493
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:53,416
[gasps]

494
00:21:53,500 --> 00:21:54,666
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm.

495
00:23:31,333 --> 00:23:33,833
[MAKINA] This is
Makina Momozono speaking.

496
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:36,625
Don't call me
"Twin-Tailed Weirdo," got it?

497
00:23:36,708 --> 00:23:39,041
In the next episode,
much to my dismay,

498
00:23:39,125 --> 00:23:42,125
I'm forced to work in
a maid café. Just great.

499
00:23:42,208 --> 00:23:45,375
So, uh. Moe, moe.

500
00:23:45,458 --> 00:23:47,666
This is stupid,
I'm not saying it!

501
00:23:47,750 --> 00:23:50,083
Period Four,
"Dignity of Maids."

502
00:23:50,166 --> 00:23:52,708
What the heck does "maid
among maids" even mean?

503
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,375
[MAKINA gasps]
Wait a minute.

504
00:23:54,458 --> 00:23:56,541
Who is this "Razor Girl,"
anyway?
