I have YD.

00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:13,708
You say you've
never heard of it?

3
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:14,583
What?

4
00:00:14,666 --> 00:00:16,208
I like wearing yukata on dates?

5
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:18,166
Or yummy dinners?

6
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:19,541
Wrong!

7
00:00:19,625 --> 00:00:21,541
It's a debilitating illness
where you can only do

8
00:00:21,625 --> 00:00:24,291
what you yearn to do.

[LUCE]
Listen...

10
00:00:25,833 --> 00:00:28,166
I'm... Koutaro Araki, the
truent from from your class!

11
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,541
Not really my business
what you do offline.

12
00:00:30,625 --> 00:00:32,625
As far as I'm concerned,
you're still Luce,

13
00:00:32,708 --> 00:00:34,416
you're still otaku
teacher's partner,

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,500
so I'm still gonna beat you.

15
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:39,000
[LUCE] They don't care how
I dress or how I act.

16
00:00:39,083 --> 00:00:41,250
They just treat me
like one of their friends.

17
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,166
It's no different
than playing online.

18
00:00:43,250 --> 00:00:44,708
If I went to school...

19
00:00:44,791 --> 00:00:47,458
...I wonder if I could meet
more people like them.

00:02:27,625 --> 00:02:29,625
Isn't this short notice?

[JUNICHIRO]
Well, we haven't celebrated

23
00:02:31,083 --> 00:02:33,666
our awesome underdog victory
from the battle event.

24
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,250
So I think we're overdue.

25
00:02:35,333 --> 00:02:38,166
[SUZUNE] This is what you were
talking about the other night.

26
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:39,250
That makes sense.

27
00:02:39,333 --> 00:02:41,416
No, it doesn't.
We won a week ago.

28
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,208
We should've celebrated
much sooner than this.

29
00:02:43,291 --> 00:02:46,291
Planning a more than
four person party took time.

30
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,458
First, uh...
This is kinda sudden.

31
00:02:48,541 --> 00:02:51,541
I wasn't expecting to meet
everyone offline just yet.

32
00:02:51,625 --> 00:02:52,708
It's like they always say:

33
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:54,916
There's no time
like the present!

34
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,708
Hey. What's this "surprise
guest" thing about?

35
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,750
[JUNICHIRO]
If I told you,

36
00:02:58,833 --> 00:03:00,166
it wouldn't be a
surprise, would it?

38
00:03:02,541 --> 00:03:04,750

[SEIJURO]
Sounds like Otaku Teacher

41
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:09,791
is up to something again.

42
00:03:09,875 --> 00:03:11,958
[KIRIKO]
But what could it be?

43
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:15,166
Okay, I've got their e-mail
address and phone number here.

44
00:03:15,250 --> 00:03:17,208
[JUNICHIRO]
Arigato!

45
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,791
I'm curious about what
you're planning, though.

46
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:21,541
Well, let's just say
I'm throwing

47
00:03:21,625 --> 00:03:23,666
a little surprise together.

48
00:03:23,750 --> 00:03:26,250
[KIRIKO]
Is it them? But why?

49
00:03:26,333 --> 00:03:28,833
[KISAKI] Well, might
as well get going, too.

50
00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:31,000
[SUZUNE] Yeah. See you all
at the party tomorrow!

[LUCE]
A real life party...

53
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,791
[LUCE]
I had a lot of fun yesterday.

54
00:03:53,875 --> 00:03:56,833
So I might be okay.

55
00:03:56,916 --> 00:04:01,625
Then again, it won't be just
Makina and Kisaki tomorrow.

56
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:05,208
There are gonna be a lot

Not really...
I'm having second thoughts.

61
00:04:26,625 --> 00:04:28,958
I don't do well in crowds,
so I'm going home.

62
00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:30,541
Have fun without me.

You've already come
this far, haven't you?

You'll be fine!

Besides, everyone here
knows you as Luce.

[LUCE]
That's right.

The only people who
know the truth are...

00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,541
Mr. Kagami...

70

Seijuro, Makina, and Kisaki...

[JUNICHIRO]
All right? Let's go!

72
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:53,375
[LUCE] Maybe I'll be okay if
I act like I do in Uroboros.

73
00:04:53,458 --> 00:04:55,750
If I just pretend I'm Luce.

322
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,083
Hmph. Look at that,
a welcoming party.

323
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,458
You guys sure have come a very
long way since a week ago.

324
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,125
Too bad.

325
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:57,916
This is where you fall!

326
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:02,666
[LUCE grunts]

327
00:17:11,791 --> 00:17:14,250
Now there's no one
left to get in our way.

328
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:16,041
What's wrong with you?

329
00:17:17,750 --> 00:17:18,791
[JUNICHIRO]
One year ago,

330
00:17:18,875 --> 00:17:21,041
Luce cast the Alamo
to support me,

331
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,750
knowing that I was
the stronger player.

332
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,416
You, however, hid
behind the Alamo

333
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,541
while weaker players
died protecting you.

334
00:17:28,625 --> 00:17:30,208
Simply pathetic.

335
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:32,541
That's not fair!

336
00:17:32,625 --> 00:17:36,083
That can only mean...
you are no longer Luce!

337
00:17:36,166 --> 00:17:37,541
[LUCE growls]

338
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,833
[JUNICHIRO] Two thousand
five hundred ninety hours!

339
00:17:41,916 --> 00:17:44,500
That's how much time I spent
fighting alongside Luce

340
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:46,916
in Uroboros!

341
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,500
And that person I always
considered my partner?

342
00:17:49,583 --> 00:17:51,500
She isn't a coward like you!

343
00:17:51,583 --> 00:17:52,958
[LUCE grunts]

344
00:17:57,375 --> 00:18:01,458
Remember! Why did you become
Luce in the first place?

345
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:02,916
[gasps]

346
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,625
[KOUTARO] Uroboros. I couldn't
pass up on the cute packaging.

347
00:18:09,458 --> 00:18:11,416
Wonder if it's any good, though.

348
00:18:12,625 --> 00:18:15,208
[KOUTARO] Oh wow, the C-A-C
has so many assets,

349
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:17,875
you can make your
character look like anyone!

350
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:19,541
[gasps]

351
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,250
[KOUTAROU]
Anyone...

352
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:23,416
It can even look like...

353
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:34,833
[LUCE] I wanted to have a place
where I could be the real me.

354
00:18:37,416 --> 00:18:39,875
[LUCE]
The real me...?

[groaning]

358
00:18:48,166 --> 00:18:50,291
That's right...
Because in here...

359
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:52,083
You could escape from reality.

360
00:18:52,166 --> 00:18:54,625
But if that's what you wanted,
why not make your character

361
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,083
look completely different?!

362
00:18:56,166 --> 00:18:58,083
What was the point
in making your character

363
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,833
look exactly like you do?!

364
00:18:59,916 --> 00:19:01,375
Because...

365
00:19:01,458 --> 00:19:05,000
For once, I wanted everyone
to see who I really am!

[LUCE groans]

00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:21,791
Tell me who you really are!
Let's hear your name!

00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,208
My name is...

My name is... Luce!

You're finally back...

Whaaaaat?!

388
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,041
[LUCE] I'm so sorry
for hiding the truth

00:20:51,125 --> 00:20:54,083
from you all this time.
I hope you can forgive me!

Wow...

391
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,708
I did not see that one coming.

00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:03,083
At all. But still...

It's nice to finally
meet you, Koutaro.

wanna join our study group?

It's lots of fun!

came out with it on his own.

Fine. It's not our
