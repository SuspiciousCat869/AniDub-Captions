You don't wanna miss
a second of this one!

This girl from Geneva,

to harass your
favorite teacher!

Today's lesson is about
being true to yourself!

6
00:00:18,416 --> 00:00:20,333
All teachers are looking
for diamonds in the rough,

7
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:23,333
and I, Junichiro Kagami,
the Ultimate Otaku Teacher,

8
00:00:23,416 --> 00:00:25,208
always find them first!

9
00:01:56,541 --> 00:01:58,333
The ol' blog is updated!

10
00:01:58,416 --> 00:02:02,125
Oh, man, finally!

11
00:02:02,208 --> 00:02:03,750
Oh, hey, you know what?

12
00:02:03,833 --> 00:02:05,791
I haven't checked
my email in a while.

I thought she forgot about me.

00:02:16,625 --> 00:02:19,125
Well, she never has
to know I read it.

18
00:02:30,208 --> 00:02:32,125
[JUNICHIRO]
Judging by the circumstances...

19
00:02:32,208 --> 00:02:35,625
Suwa's murderer has to be
either Yonekura, Maekawa,

20
00:02:35,708 --> 00:02:38,833
Yokoyama, Yoshioka, or Iwata.

[SUZUNE]
I'm coming! One more second!

34
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,625
What the heck is she
doing at my house?

35
00:03:06,708 --> 00:03:07,958
Suzune, don't do it!

[TIM] I thought I'd have
to beat the door down!

What's it been? 5 years?

Oh, she's really here. Ugh...

42
00:03:20,416 --> 00:03:21,500
Pardon me, girly.

00:03:21,583 --> 00:03:23,083
[SUZUNE]
Uh...

44
00:03:23,166 --> 00:03:26,666
I-I'm sorry, but could I ask you
to take off your shoes, please?

45
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:28,875
Oh! Sure, that's no
problem at all.

47
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,000
A bit odd, but I can't
blame you for wanting them.

00:03:32,083 --> 00:03:32,958
No, that's...

[TIM]
I designed them myself.

They're comfy and stylish.

some good use from them.

00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:41,916
Uh... Ok, sure!

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,083
[JUNICHIRO]
Suzune, she's never listened

55
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:47,208
to anybody in her life,
so don't bother.

56
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:49,416
This is Professor
Tim Berners Lynn.

57
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,500
There's this lab in
Switzerland called CERM

58
00:03:51,583 --> 00:03:52,833
and she's in charge of it.

Also, she's the

you say to her, as you can see.

[TIM gasps]

64
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:04,250
The greatest minds in the world?

00:04:04,333 --> 00:04:05,916

00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Ignores everything?

67
00:04:07,583 --> 00:04:09,916
[JUNICHIRO] So. Wanna tell
me why you're here?

68
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,583
[TIM]
Finally, you acknowledge me.

69
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,166
Why yes, I didn't
just come to Japan

70
00:04:13,250 --> 00:04:14,625
on a whim to eat your food,

71
00:04:14,708 --> 00:04:17,166
although I think I will
do that first, thank you.

72
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,416
Mm-Mm!

73
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,375
Wow, do Japanese people
cook a feast like this

74
00:04:20,458 --> 00:04:21,750
for dinner every day?

75
00:04:21,833 --> 00:04:23,291
How do you find the time?

76
00:04:23,375 --> 00:04:24,416
My goodness!

77
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,750
[SUZUNE]
Uh...

78
00:04:25,833 --> 00:04:28,083
Ah, Sister, the interloper
has paid you her version

79
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:28,958
of a compliment.

00:04:29,041 --> 00:04:29,875
[chuckles]

81
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:30,583
Thank you!

You're welcome, I think?

00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,666
And it's all
so delicious, too!

84
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:35,625
[SUZUNE]
Miss Lynn?

85
00:04:35,708 --> 00:04:36,875
[gasps]

86
00:04:36,958 --> 00:04:39,500
Can you tell me how you
came to know my brother?

87
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:42,000
Oh, now she's gonna
trot out that old story.

88
00:04:42,083 --> 00:04:43,833
Huh?

89
00:04:43,916 --> 00:04:44,875
[chuckles]

90
00:04:46,708 --> 00:04:48,375
I suppose you'd
have to be aware of

91
00:04:48,458 --> 00:04:51,125
Junichiro's famous article
in Nayture magazine?

92
00:04:51,208 --> 00:04:53,000
Of course, how could I not be?

93
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:56,291
That article began our
ill-timed entanglement.

94
00:04:56,375 --> 00:04:58,958
The world had never seen
a theory as brazen as his

95
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,208
"Anywhere Door".

96
00:05:00,291 --> 00:05:02,375
Not even evolution nor
the discovery of cells

97
00:05:02,458 --> 00:05:05,041
could compare and debate
erupted everywhere.

98
00:05:05,125 --> 00:05:07,333
Even inside CERM
we were embroiled.

99
00:05:07,416 --> 00:05:10,375
Our highest pride was placed
in knowing, definitively,

100
00:05:10,458 --> 00:05:13,166
that we were the foremost
experts on particle physics.

101
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:15,291
This was a serious blow.

102
00:05:15,375 --> 00:05:17,041
Put together a
development team for this.

103
00:05:17,125 --> 00:05:18,583
Bring anyone with time to spare.

104
00:05:18,666 --> 00:05:20,958
Actually,
bring everyone in, period!

105
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,750
That's just not possible.

106
00:05:22,833 --> 00:05:25,250
I'd have to freeze over
500 active experiments

107
00:05:25,333 --> 00:05:26,208
in a dozen areas.

[TIM]

109
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,791
Did you actually
read this headline?

110
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,708
Tell me, what do you
think it means?

111
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,125
[gasps]

112
00:05:33,208 --> 00:05:35,916
This is a slap in the face
to the science community.

113
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,333
CERM should be the pinnacle of

114
00:05:37,416 --> 00:05:39,166
all particle
physics laboratories.

115
00:05:39,250 --> 00:05:41,750
It's crucial brats like
this understand that!

116
00:05:41,833 --> 00:05:43,708
Uh, yes ma'am, as you say!

117
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,416
[chuckles]

118
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:52,750
[TIM] I deployed all of the
hundreds of researchers

119
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:55,458
at my disposal to set up a
counterevidence experiment

120
00:05:55,541 --> 00:05:57,333
to disprove Junichiro's theory.

121
00:05:57,416 --> 00:06:00,500
Then I invited him to come
to Switzerland to watch.

122
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,458
[TIM]
Mm. Herb tea?

know everything!

Don't underestimate
your elders!"

125
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,291
I wanted to say.

126
00:06:07,375 --> 00:06:09,875
[SUZUNE] She's like Junichiro,
but terrifying.

127
00:06:11,833 --> 00:06:14,083
I was confident,
but the result...

128
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:17,041
[TIM] Have a look at
the bank of monitors.

129
00:06:17,125 --> 00:06:18,708
There's a series of models.

130
00:06:18,791 --> 00:06:21,250
They represent facets of
the space-time warp device

131
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,875
proposed by your theory.

132
00:06:22,958 --> 00:06:24,500
Our super computer, Kammuri,

133
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:28,416
has exacted a 4,000 dpi
3-D virtual experiment.

134
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,041
The V-R replicates the
conditions and parameters

135
00:06:31,125 --> 00:06:34,083
as if we were conducting
an actual test of the door.

136
00:06:34,166 --> 00:06:37,125
The target should be
teleported from Tokyo...

137
00:06:37,208 --> 00:06:39,583
...to the corresponding
"Anywhere Door"

138
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,458
here, in Geneva, Switzerland.

139
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:44,708
There are at least
214 quantifiable issues

140
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,958
with your hypothesis.

141
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,208
We believe anyone could
disrupt the experiment.

142
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,875
If any of them prove to be
statistically significant

143
00:06:50,958 --> 00:06:53,583
to within a margin greater
than point 1 percent,

144
00:06:53,666 --> 00:06:55,750
the representational
target model will fail

145
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,666
to be transported across
the space-time axis.

146
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,083
I do trust you were able
to make sense of all that?

Oh, but of course.

You must understand since
you wrote the paper.

156
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,291
The result was a disaster.

157
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,000
I was confident, but the
most powerful supercomputer

158
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,000
in the world agreed
with his hypothesis,

159
00:07:34,083 --> 00:07:35,875
thus our objections
were invalid.

160
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:39,208
We couldn't disprove
Junichiro's theory.

Woah...

00:07:40,708 --> 00:07:42,750
So, we conceded.

163
00:07:42,833 --> 00:07:44,208
All that really happened?

164
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,500
Oh yes, and just
how I told you.

165
00:07:46,583 --> 00:07:47,916
But not only that.

166
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,375
This idiot spent the whole
time playing mobile games

167
00:07:50,458 --> 00:07:53,250
as if nothing of any importance
was happening around him.

168
00:07:53,333 --> 00:07:56,500
Booyah, I just hit a new
high score of over 9000!

169
00:07:56,583 --> 00:07:57,458
What'd you say?

170
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:58,666
[groans]

171
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,000
[TIM] If I thought I
could get away with it,

172
00:08:00,083 --> 00:08:01,916
I would have beaten
him to death.

173
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,291
Still, I managed to
contain the urge.

174
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,458
Barely.

175
00:08:05,541 --> 00:08:06,833
If that's all you wanted,
I'm gonna go.

176
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:08,875
[TIM]
No. Wait!

177
00:08:08,958 --> 00:08:10,458
Huh?

178
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:11,875
[TIM]
Little boy.

179
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:14,541
Or, excuse me: Mr. Kagami.

180
00:08:14,625 --> 00:08:17,458
As head of CERM, I cannot
let you just walk away.

181
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:18,500
[gasps]

182
00:08:21,166 --> 00:08:23,041
I need you to
come work with us!

183
00:08:23,125 --> 00:08:24,625
Nah.

184
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,708
At the very least, I can't miss
the next episode of "Maji Love".

185
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:28,458
Also, I'm busy with my blog.

186
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,541
Call me when Switzerland
starts simulcasting anime.

187
00:08:31,625 --> 00:08:33,625
[TIM growls]

188
00:08:33,708 --> 00:08:35,125
[TIM]
Engineers around the world

189
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,375
dream of CERM noticing
their dissertations,

190
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:40,416
and some kid has me
practically begging him to stay.

191
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,875
Not only that, but he as
the nerve to turn me down

192
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,500
to watch cartoons and
work on his blog?

193
00:08:45,583 --> 00:08:47,500
What do you want me to say?
It was unavoidable!

194
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:50,291
And that episode turned out
to be awesome, actually!

195
00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,208
Ever since then, I've been
calling relentlessly,

196
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,458
sending countless emails,
mailing letters,

197
00:08:54,541 --> 00:08:56,416
leaving voice messages
day after day.

198
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:59,375
I tried everything short of
telegrams and carrier pigeons.

199
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:01,083
But I never got one
word in response,

200
00:09:01,166 --> 00:09:03,041
so, joy, I've come here.

201
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,041
One way or another,
you're coming back with me.

202
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,583
[JUNICHIRO]
I refuse!

203
00:09:08,666 --> 00:09:10,333
You don't need to
worry one bit.

204
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,125
We have all the toys
you could possibly want,

205
00:09:12,208 --> 00:09:13,791
and some you haven't
even dreamed of!

206
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:14,708
[JUNICHIRO]
I swear.

207
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,500
It's like you're
completely deaf.

208
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:18,000
[TIM]
We move out immediately!

209
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:20,541
My private jet is spinning
up at the airport.

210
00:09:20,625 --> 00:09:23,250
[JUNICHIRO] How many times do
I have to say I'm not going?

211
00:09:23,333 --> 00:09:24,916
[TIM]
Huh?

212
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,791
[JUNICHIRO]
What?

213
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,250
You're really shocked right now?

214
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:29,791
[gasps] I suppose I
should have expected you

215
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:31,458
to behave like a child,
but fear not!

216
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:33,416
This is all part of my plan,
and I assure you,

217
00:09:33,500 --> 00:09:34,916
I will not fail to
bring you back!

218
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,291
[JUNICHIRO]
If this is according to plan,

219
00:09:36,375 --> 00:09:38,000
why do you seem
so surprised, huh?

220
00:09:38,083 --> 00:09:40,125
[TIM] I will not return
to Geneva empty handed,

221
00:09:40,208 --> 00:09:42,875
Junichiro, so until you
agree to come along,

222
00:09:42,958 --> 00:09:45,208
I am just going to have
to move in with you!

223
00:09:45,291 --> 00:09:46,208
--[BOTH gasp]
--[SUZUNE] What?!

224
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:47,916
Did I just hear her right?

225
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,291
Behold!

226
00:09:49,375 --> 00:09:51,333
My PJs are designed with
a subatomic particle motif!

227
00:09:51,416 --> 00:09:52,958
Come on, nobody
wants to see that.

228
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,208
Put those away.

229
00:09:54,291 --> 00:09:56,708
What about my subatomic
particle pillowcases?

230
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,166
If I hear one more thing
about particles today...

231
00:09:59,250 --> 00:10:00,875
So to make sure I've
got this straight,

232
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,375
you had an amazing
job offer years ago.

233
00:10:03,458 --> 00:10:05,625
But you turned it down so
you could sit on your butt

234
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,250
at home all day doing nothing?

235
00:10:07,333 --> 00:10:09,541
[JUNICHIRO] Hm. Honestly,
it's like no one around here

236
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,375
even understands me.

237

00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:23,666
Well. Seems like
a peaceful home.

[SUZUNE] Hurry up, bro,
we're running late!

248
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:34,458
[TIM] What on Earth are
you doing up so early?

249
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:35,958
[JUNICHIRO] What does
it look like I'm doing?

250
00:10:36,041 --> 00:10:38,166
Cramming breakfast
and leaving for work!

251
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:40,833
Uh, I'm cleaning up
and going to school.

252
00:10:40,916 --> 00:10:42,000
Junichiro, move your butt!

253
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,708

--[JUNICHIRO groans]
--[SUZUNE sighs]

255
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,583
I think we can just make it
to school without being late.

256
00:10:47,666 --> 00:10:49,541
Oh, I don't care about that.

257
00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,666
However...

258
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,750
Why's this bleach
job stalking us?

259
00:10:52,833 --> 00:10:54,750
It's a free country.
Is there a problem?

260
00:10:54,833 --> 00:10:57,458
Yeah, of course there is!
This is harassment!

261
00:10:57,541 --> 00:10:59,291
You need to leave
me to work in peace!

262
00:10:59,375 --> 00:11:02,166
As if you'd ever go to work.
You can't trick me that easily.

263
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:03,333
Are you dense?

264
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:05,541
How can I buy anime
without a job, huh?

265
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:08,083
Think about it! Even someone
like me has to work!

266
00:11:08,166 --> 00:11:10,708
And believe it or not,
I'm the most popular teacher

267
00:11:10,791 --> 00:11:12,416
at Icho Academy right now!

268
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:15,708
You teach actual kids?
I'm totally speechless.

269
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:19,166
It's pretty hard to believe
at first. But it is the truth.

270
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:22,250
Impossible. Junichiro the YD?

271

How could such a socially inept
hermit have become a teacher?

272
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:27,666
Yep, I'm working hard
for the money these days!

273
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:30,125
Oh, and the Academy is off
limits to all Outlanders,

00:11:30,208 --> 00:11:31,708
so don't go
trying to sneak in!

Get it? Your little
mission is a bust.

What?! How did this
woman get into my class?

286
00:11:59,416 --> 00:12:02,000
Why am I here?
Truly a deep question.

287
00:12:02,083 --> 00:12:04,041
[KOYOMI] Because the
situation amused me.

288
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:06,125
Options? Why would
you be on Tim's side?

289
00:12:06,208 --> 00:12:07,750
Hey, long time no see.

290
00:12:07,833 --> 00:12:10,583
She thoughtfully brought all
the details of the situation

291
00:12:10,666 --> 00:12:11,916
to my attention.

292
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,375
In order to explore the
problem in greater depth,

293
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:16,708
I've decided to
accept Miss Lynn.

294
00:12:16,791 --> 00:12:18,000
She'll be attending Icho

295

as an international
cultural exchange student.

enough to deal with.

00:12:24,625 --> 00:12:26,666
Perhaps you'll actually
listen to her.

299
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:28,458
She is quite smart!

300
00:12:28,541 --> 00:12:31,291
[KOYOMI] Oh, also, It might
interest everyone to know

301
00:12:31,375 --> 00:12:33,500
that Miss Lynn will be staying
at Mr. Kagami's house

302
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:35,291
during her time in Japan.

00:13:08,416 --> 00:13:09,791
This is the deluxe
fourth series,

321
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:12,875
limited edition Crouching
Sergeant Saunders figurine!

322
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:15,291
If you want it, all you have
to do is sign this contract.

323
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,416
Oh, and I'm supposed to tell you
that the serial number is 1!

324
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:20,791
Oh my goodness,
that is quite lovely!

325
00:13:20,875 --> 00:13:22,625
Ugh, Junichiro.

326
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,666
[SEIJURO]
Tsk.

327
00:13:23,750 --> 00:13:25,708
[TIM] I ordered
lunch for everyone!

328
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:29,083
He won't be able to
resist my personal chef.

329
00:13:29,166 --> 00:13:30,208
[laughs]

330
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,375
That's nice, but I'm
not really hungry.

331
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:34,250
[BOTH]
Uh-oh! She's bad news!

332
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:35,750
Uh... Hey!

333
00:13:35,833 --> 00:13:38,000
You're gonna have to level
with us about this situation.

334
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:40,541
What exactly does that
crazy woman want?

335
00:13:40,625 --> 00:13:43,375
Well, uh, let's just say
it's sort of complicated.

336
00:13:43,458 --> 00:13:44,791
[KIRIKO]
But she lives with you?

337
00:13:44,875 --> 00:13:46,541
So how come we've never
heard of her before?

338
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:49,125
What's she doing to Mr. Kagami?
This is unacceptable!

339
00:13:49,208 --> 00:13:51,166
I don't know why you think
I'm some kind of expert

340
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:51,875
on the subject.

341
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:53,333
C'mon, spit it out!

342
00:13:53,416 --> 00:13:55,291
[KIRIKO] Just tell us
whatever you do know!

343
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,750
[SUZUNE whimpers]

344
00:13:57,833 --> 00:13:59,833
[GIRLS]
What?!

345
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:02,541
[chuckles]

346
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:04,333
This woman is
smart and powerful,

347
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,958
but can she really
convince him to quit?

348
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,666
We can't let her
get away with this!

349
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,375
We stand a chance
of stopping her

350
00:14:09,458 --> 00:14:11,625
if their relationship isn't,
you know, like, that.

351
00:14:11,708 --> 00:14:14,041
[gasps] You don't think it
really is like that, do you?

352
00:14:14,125 --> 00:14:16,208
Well, whatever their
relationship is or isn't,

353
00:14:16,291 --> 00:14:19,458
if we can't put a stop to her
saucy antics immediately,

354
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:23,458
Then Junichiro could wake up and
find his YD butt in Switzerland.

355
00:14:23,541 --> 00:14:25,000
Is that about right?

356
00:14:25,083 --> 00:14:26,208
[SUZUNE]
Yep.

357
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,541
The only thing we can
do is get rid of her

358
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,333
by any means necessary.

359
00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:36,000
May I help you?

360
00:14:36,083 --> 00:14:38,583
You stop this game
right now, ya hear?

361
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,500
Pray tell, to what
game do you refer?

362
00:14:40,583 --> 00:14:42,791
We're talking about our
teacher, Mr. Kagami.

363
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:44,500
[TIM]
Why are we talking about him?

364
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,500
Because we all know what
you're up to, lady,

365
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:49,083
and we don't think Geneva's
a good idea for Junichiro.

366
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,458
What? You're. I. What?

367
00:14:51,541 --> 00:14:53,000
She's trying to
say we need him,

368
00:14:53,083 --> 00:14:54,958
and you want to take
him away from us.

369
00:14:55,041 --> 00:14:58,250
So you think I'm the villain
in this little drama.

370
00:14:58,333 --> 00:14:59,416
[ALL sigh]

371
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,458
You've given me a
lot to think about.

372
00:15:01,541 --> 00:15:03,500
Never in my wildest dreams
would I have thought

373
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:05,875
he could be this
popular as a teacher.

374
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,125
He's not going anywhere
till I'm done with him.

375
00:15:08,208 --> 00:15:10,291
The two of us got
a score to settle!

376
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,041
You don't understand
what he's done for us!

377
00:15:12,125 --> 00:15:13,750
Please don't take him away!

378
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,875
Now look. You want to
keep him as your teacher,

379
00:15:16,958 --> 00:15:19,875
but is what you're asking really
the best thing for him?

380
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,625
Let me shed some
light about Junichiro.

381
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,875
He has the power to effect real
change all over the world.

382
00:15:24,958 --> 00:15:27,791
Keeping his imagination
buried away in some school

383
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,208
for entitled brats...

384
00:15:29,291 --> 00:15:30,916
Don't you think that
does a disservice

385
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:32,458
to the entire human race?

386
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:34,041
What an awful thing to say.

387
00:15:34,125 --> 00:15:35,833
[MAKINA] I'm going to
disagree with you there.

388
00:15:35,916 --> 00:15:37,125
[ALL]
Huh?

389
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:38,166
You don't know what
makes him a good teacher,

390
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:40,625
or why it's what
he was meant to do!

391
00:15:40,708 --> 00:15:42,125
[MAKINA]
Wow, did I just say that?

392
00:15:42,208 --> 00:15:43,833
Well, you've got a pair on you!

393
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:45,291
What do you think
gives you the right

394
00:15:45,375 --> 00:15:47,166
to try to monopolize
Junichiro's skills?

395
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,333
Instead of stealing him,

396
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:50,791
why don't you ask
yourself that question?

397
00:15:50,875 --> 00:15:53,000
[MAKINA] I've got to
turn this up a notch!

398
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,541
[gasps]

399
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:57,083
I posit that Mr. Kagami can
change this world for the better

400
00:15:57,166 --> 00:16:00,541
just as easily here as
at your research center.

401
00:16:00,625 --> 00:16:02,333
[MAKINA]
I really hope he can!

402
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:05,250
[TIM] Hmph. Strong words,
indeed, little girl.

403
00:16:07,750 --> 00:16:08,958
I'm willing to bet his sister

404
00:16:09,041 --> 00:16:10,625
has some ideas of
where he should be.

405
00:16:10,708 --> 00:16:12,083
She knows him
better than any of us.

406
00:16:12,166 --> 00:16:14,583
So, should he be a
scientist or a teacher?

407
00:16:14,666 --> 00:16:16,416
I don't...

408
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:19,958
How am I supposed to decide
what's really best for him?

409
00:16:20,041 --> 00:16:21,750
Please, tell me.

410
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,000
Wish I knew, but we do
need to figure this out.

411
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:25,166
[ALL]
Huh?

412
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,750
Having you around
here just for one day

413
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,708
has already been more
annoyance than I can stand.

414
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,458
He's gotta make his own choices

415
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:34,666
because it's not really up
to you, or you, or you. Is it?

416
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:35,875
I suppose that's true.

417
00:16:35,958 --> 00:16:38,250
But I think I know how
to make him choose.

418
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,125
Learn that move from Cyborg?

419
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:44,291
Junichiro, I have a
real quandary for you!

420
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,333
Oh, yeah?

421
00:16:45,416 --> 00:16:46,666
If you agree to
this proposition,

422
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:48,666
I will stop all of
this drama for now.

423
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,541
But if you're unable
to rise to the occasion,

424
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:52,833
then you'll have no choice
but to come to Geneva.

425
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,500
I thought I made it
clear from the start

426
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,541
I wasn't going anywhere.

427
00:16:56,625 --> 00:16:58,750
We both know there's a
problem teleporting objects

428
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:00,083
instantly across space,

429
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,875
and if you can present
the solution as a formula,

430
00:17:01,958 --> 00:17:03,166
I'll be on my flight home.

431
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,541
I'll give you...

432
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:06,416
How about, until...?

433
00:17:06,500 --> 00:17:08,166
What's sundown at this latitude?

434
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:09,666
Why don't we say
seventeen-thirty?

435
00:17:09,750 --> 00:17:10,708
That should work.

436
00:17:10,791 --> 00:17:12,291
As I've told you repeatedly,

437
00:17:12,375 --> 00:17:15,541
I have no interest in physics
or science of any kind.

438
00:17:15,625 --> 00:17:17,375
Oh, Junichiro,
don't be so myopic,

439
00:17:17,458 --> 00:17:18,958
it's not straight science.

440
00:17:19,041 --> 00:17:20,916
This is about more than
just a smaller phone

441
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,166
or a faster processor.

442
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:24,791
I'm talking about magic
wands and super suits.

443
00:17:24,875 --> 00:17:26,250
In other words,

444
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:28,458
you have the power to prove
that nothing's impossible.

445
00:17:28,541 --> 00:17:30,333
That your fantasies are real!

446
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:33,000
Would you dare make a liar
of Sargeant Saunders?

447
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:36,166
[grunts]
That is heresy!

448
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:38,041
Then you must accept
this challenge!

449
00:17:38,125 --> 00:17:40,375
Accepted! You n'wah!

450
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,583
[SUZUNE]
Wow, she played him

451
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:43,500
like a video game champion.

452
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,833
And that question?
Can he solve it?

453
00:17:45,916 --> 00:17:48,458
Taking into consideration
Junichiro's tremendous intellect

454
00:17:48,541 --> 00:17:50,708
and inventiveness, he should
figure out the formula

455
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:51,791
in about a week.

456
00:17:51,875 --> 00:17:52,916
[ALL]
What?!

457
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,125
Now that that's settled,

458
00:17:54,208 --> 00:17:56,250
I guess I'll pack up
and relax until sundown.

459
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,083
Not that I haven't
treasured all this time

460
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,583
that we've spent together.

461
00:17:59,666 --> 00:18:00,875
That's horrible.

462
00:18:00,958 --> 00:18:02,916
She didn't just play
Junichiro like an expert,

463
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:06,125
she played us, as well.
It's too late. She's good.

464
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,875
What can we do?

465
00:18:07,958 --> 00:18:11,083
If it wasn't a physics problem,
we could maybe help.

466
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,625
But the way it is now,
we'll just have to have faith.

Hey, bro?

472
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,375
I don't get it,
what happened?

473
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,000
Where are you going,
Mr. Kagami?

474
00:19:06,083 --> 00:19:08,125
Did you solve the
problem or didn't you?

00:19:08,208 --> 00:19:09,500
Weird.

476
00:19:09,583 --> 00:19:12,333
He was running like somebody
lit a fire under him.

477
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,291
There's almost zero time left.

478
00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:15,708
Only 30 minutes!

479
00:19:15,791 --> 00:19:18,166
This is playing out just
the way she wants it to!

480
00:19:18,250 --> 00:19:20,708
With her legs and her
hair and her schemes!

481
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,291
--[KISAKI] Let's go!
--[SEIJURO] She sucks!

483
00:19:42,583 --> 00:19:43,791
Hey there,
whoever you are!

484
00:19:43,875 --> 00:19:45,208
I got your text message!

485
00:19:45,291 --> 00:19:47,541
--I'm here to help you!

[JUNICHIRO]
Options?

[STUDENTS panting]

488
00:19:50,875 --> 00:19:52,208
[SUZUNE]
Junichiro?

489
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:53,166
The chairperson?

490
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:54,875
[KIRIKO]
Huh?

491
00:19:54,958 --> 00:19:57,000
[KISAKI]
Time's up.

492
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,708
So where does it stand?

493
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,916
Did Mr. Kagami win or
lose the challenge?

494
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:02,791
I'm worried.

495
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:04,458
--[SEIJURO growls]
--Oh, it's hopeless.

496
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:06,041
What are we gonna do?

497
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,166
Actually, things are
not as entirely grim

498
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,791
as they may appear to be.

499
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:12,750
You see, I proposed a challenge
of my own to our dear Miss Lynn.

500
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,000
What challenge?

501
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,500
We bet on what would be
your number 1 priority,

502
00:20:16,583 --> 00:20:19,000
the idea of turning
fiction into fact,

503
00:20:19,083 --> 00:20:22,375
or a desperate call for
help from a frantic student.

504
00:20:22,458 --> 00:20:23,916
It seemed unfair.

505
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:25,916
I didn't think it was the
best test of your character

506
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,458
to measure your
potential against

507
00:20:27,541 --> 00:20:29,875
some theoretical
physics problem.

508
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:31,291
[chuckles]

509
00:20:31,375 --> 00:20:34,125
[JUNICHIRO] Hm? Yeah,
that's the message I received.

510
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,750
[ALL]
Hm?

511
00:20:36,833 --> 00:20:40,000
Mr. Kagami, you chose the
well-being of a student

512
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:42,125
over an intellectual challenge.

513
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,625
Ugh.

514
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:46,125
So you masterminded
the whole thing.

515
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:49,625
Everyone, Mr. Kagami is staying
here at Icho Academy!

516
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,708
Huh?

517
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:52,666
[KOYOMI]
You can all stop worrying now.

518
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:54,083
He's not going...

519
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:55,458
To Geneva?

520
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:56,875
This is the best!

521
00:20:56,958 --> 00:20:59,208

[TIM]
Junichiro.

526
00:21:07,416 --> 00:21:09,750
Is this what you
truly yearn to do?

527
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,625
I envy the simplicity.

528

[laughs]

531
00:21:26,416 --> 00:21:27,208
But of course,

532
00:21:27,291 --> 00:21:29,291
you'd already sent the answers.

533
00:21:29,375 --> 00:21:33,083
Your genius is truly one of
a kind, Junichiro Kagami.

534
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:38,416
[TIM]
Enjoy it.

535
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:41,208
Because I haven't given
up on recruiting you.

536
00:21:41,291 --> 00:21:43,708
The project is already active.

537
00:21:43,791 --> 00:21:46,208
It's just a matter of time.

538
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,916
You dork.

539
00:21:53,791 --> 00:21:56,416
[JUNICHIRO] And that
concludes today's lesson.

540
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,541
[TIM]
I am Tim Berners Lynn.

541
00:23:32,625 --> 00:23:34,000
Look out, Junichiro!

542
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:36,041
I haven't given up on you yet.

543
00:23:36,125 --> 00:23:39,166
I will bring you with me
to Geneva, some day.

544
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:41,041
Next episode,
a new girl joins,

545
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:43,958
one who can calculate the
monetary value of a person.

546
00:23:44,041 --> 00:23:47,125
Plus, she's the daughter of the
CEO of a video game company.

547
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:49,625
And her goal is
to marry Junichiro?

548
00:23:49,708 --> 00:23:51,958
Period fourteen,
"The Assessment Girl."

549
00:23:52,041 --> 00:23:54,416
What kind of price did she
put on Junichiro's head?

550
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:57,458
If it were all up to me,
I'd say "Priceless"!
