1
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,208
Hey! Don't change that channel!

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:11,750
You don't wanna miss
a second of this one!

3
00:00:11,833 --> 00:00:14,750
The one distressing our damsel
is the King of Games himself!

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,916
I have no choice but to
face him on his own turf!

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,875
All teachers are looking
for diamonds in the rough,

6
00:00:19,958 --> 00:00:23,041
and I Junichiro Kagami,
the Ultimate Otaku Teacher,

7
00:00:23,125 --> 00:00:25,125
always find them first!

8
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:54,041
[JUNICHIRO] I didn't
think hostile takeovers

9
00:01:54,125 --> 00:01:56,791
and political marriages
actually happened in real life.

10
00:01:56,875 --> 00:01:59,208
It's kinda cool when you
look at it that way.

11
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:01,833
And yet that doesn't make
me feel any better about it.

12
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:03,833
Which really is unfortunate.

13
00:02:03,916 --> 00:02:07,000
Could be a favorable marriage
if you were more into him.

14
00:02:07,083 --> 00:02:08,666
Then again, the guy
doesn't strike me

15
00:02:08,750 --> 00:02:10,208
as the "prince charming" type.

16
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,291
I can't blame you for
wanting to run away.

17
00:02:12,375 --> 00:02:13,583
Wait.

18
00:02:13,666 --> 00:02:16,083
How much do you know about him?

19
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,750
Well, other than he's the
CEO of Activision Frigate?

20
00:02:19,833 --> 00:02:22,833
Enough. His father was
the founder of Macrosoft,

21
00:02:22,916 --> 00:02:25,458
and for three years running he's
been the undisputed champion

22
00:02:25,541 --> 00:02:28,375
of the King Halo series.

23
00:02:28,458 --> 00:02:30,833
He's a genius programmer
despite his age,

24
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:33,666
and his name is Hell Gates.

25
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:36,708
'Kay, you've done
your homework.

26
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:38,833
But that also means you
know what the odds are.

27
00:02:38,916 --> 00:02:41,375
There's no way you can stand
against a force like that.

28
00:02:41,458 --> 00:02:43,833
Hey now, don't get
melodramatic on me.

29
00:02:43,916 --> 00:02:45,166
He's just a dude,

30
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,791
it's not like we're
fighting the Ultima Weapon.

31
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,583
[CROWD cheers]

32
00:02:50,666 --> 00:02:52,166
[MALE CUSTOMER A]
I can't believe it!

33
00:02:52,250 --> 00:02:55,583
He really beat the
game with just a knife!

34
00:02:55,666 --> 00:02:57,958
This guy looks a lot
like Hell Gates, right?

Excuse, me! Sir?

You've earned a prize for
getting today's high score.

I know it isn't a big deal,

[gasps]

Of course I do. It's a
credit to my greatness.

00:03:25,666 --> 00:03:27,458
Thanks for the memories.

Aw, I didn't sleep a wink.

Hey! Mornin'!

No. I should really get--

[yelps]

52
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:41,458
[MADOKA] How in the
world did he find me?

53
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:42,875
What are you doing here, Gates?!

54
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,416
Oh. Come on.

55
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,125
You know the answer to that one.

56
00:03:46,208 --> 00:03:47,500
Now that you've
turned sixteen,

57
00:03:47,583 --> 00:03:50,291
it's not creepy or weird
for me to marry you, right?

58
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:51,625
I wasn't sure about him,

59
00:03:51,708 --> 00:03:54,166
but once he said he's
your fiancé, I let him in.

60
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:56,458
Caught yourself one of
those rich handsome types.

61
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:57,333
Way to go, girl!

62
00:03:57,416 --> 00:03:59,041
Let's step outside, Gates.

63
00:03:59,125 --> 00:04:00,791
I need some air.

64
00:04:03,708 --> 00:04:05,541
What in the hell is
the matter with you?

65
00:04:05,625 --> 00:04:06,916
The announcement
of our engagement

66
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,375
isn't for a whole other week!

67
00:04:08,458 --> 00:04:09,708
I'm free until then!

68
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,208
[GATES] What difference
does a measly week make?

69
00:04:12,291 --> 00:04:13,791
The end result is still the same

70
00:04:13,875 --> 00:04:15,666
whether there are
seven days or zero.

71

[sighs]

72
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,083
Let's just cut to the chase
and live happily ever after.

73
00:04:20,166 --> 00:04:22,583
I mean, if I'm buying your small
business that I don't want,

74
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,125
there had better be a perk
in there for me somewhere.

75
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,250
[gasps]

76
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:27,958
I'm doing you a favor.

Just think of all
your employees.

78
00:04:30,166 --> 00:04:33,625
Now they get to be part of
a real company. Big time.

Mr. Kagami, how long
have you been there?

Please don't tell me this

Y'know, I'm a pretty
big gamer myself.

That's what made Madoka
fall in love with me!

'Cause I got mad game, yo!

Like there's any chance
I'm gonna believe you.

If that were true,

bothered a long-- Uh...

Last night, as we stood on the
balcony underneath the stars,

"There's no way I'd marry a man

to run away together!

when the results are
painfully obvious.

raise the stakes.

[gasps]

124
00:06:03,041 --> 00:06:04,916
I'll agree to duel you
under the condition that,

125
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,041
when I win, you cancel
your engagement to Madoka.

126
00:06:08,125 --> 00:06:10,583
Oh, plus. You give up on
the company buyout thing.

00:06:10,666 --> 00:06:11,833
[gasps]

128
00:06:11,916 --> 00:06:14,500
[MADOKA]
So that's what you're up to.

129
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,083
I'll tell you what.

130
00:06:16,166 --> 00:06:18,833
In the interest of fairness,
why don't we play King Halo?

131
00:06:18,916 --> 00:06:21,000
Seeing as your company makes it,

132
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:24,083
you might even stand
a chance against me.

133
00:06:24,166 --> 00:06:27,041
Are you serious, or just insane?

134
00:06:27,125 --> 00:06:28,625
In fact.

135
00:06:28,708 --> 00:06:31,541
Why don't we play the version
that hasn't been released yet?

136
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,583
Y'know, the one coming
out next month?

137
00:06:33,666 --> 00:06:34,958
King Halo 3.

138
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,458
That way, you get an edge

139
00:06:36,541 --> 00:06:39,375
and I get a chance to literally
beat you at your own game.

140
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,458
Obviously, if I win,
you will have to forfeit

141
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,416
your own pursuits of Madoka.

142
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:48,250
However, there's something
else I want, too.

143
00:06:48,333 --> 00:06:50,166
For my second condition,

144
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,666
once I've beaten you,
you must never touch

145
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,208
another video game for
as long as you live.

146
00:06:55,291 --> 00:06:56,625
[gasps]

147
00:06:56,708 --> 00:06:57,958
Fine.

148
00:06:58,041 --> 00:07:01,958
It'll be more fun this way.
I accept your terms.

149
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:04,166
[chuckles]
Sure about that?

150
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:06,583
I always make good
on my promises.

151
00:07:06,666 --> 00:07:09,416
I will collect on this bet.

152
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,875
What do you mean
by that? Tell me.

153
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:14,416
When this is all done,
he'll be hopping on a boat.

154
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,541
Once the ferry
reaches the U.S.,

155
00:07:16,625 --> 00:07:19,083
he'll spend the rest of his
life under twenty-four hour

156
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:20,583
surveillance by my company.

157
00:07:20,666 --> 00:07:23,458
That way I'll know he's
abiding by our agreement.

158
00:07:23,541 --> 00:07:25,708
But, doesn't that
seem like overkill?

159
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,833
It's just a game.
it isn't worth it!

160
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,333
[JUNICHIRO]
Sure it is!

161
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:31,625
After all, what's the point
in facing the King of Games

162
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:34,916
if there's no risk of ending up
in the Home For Infinite Losers?

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,708
You'll get no
argument from me.

164
00:07:36,791 --> 00:07:38,416
No! Don't do this!

165
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,625
[chuckles]

166
00:07:39,708 --> 00:07:41,875
Then our duel will take
place this evening.

167
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:43,875
Hope you're ready.

168
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:45,500
Our venue...

169
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,250
...Is Tokyo Treasureland!

170
00:07:49,791 --> 00:07:50,708
What?!

171
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,208
Come on!

172
00:07:52,291 --> 00:07:54,333
I can't believe you made another
stupid promise like that!

173
00:07:54,416 --> 00:07:55,666
But I'm not gonna lose.

174
00:07:55,750 --> 00:07:56,666
Who cares?

175
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,875
Haven't you heard
the expression

176
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,875
about pride coming
before a fall?

177
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:01,708
[MADOKA] Listen.
You're better off giving up

178
00:08:01,791 --> 00:08:03,083
and forgettin' about this.

179
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,750
I'm the daughter
of an entrepreneur,

180
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:07,416
so I have responsibilities
to the family business,

181
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:08,958
but none of that involves you.

182
00:08:09,041 --> 00:08:11,708
It's just my time to start
acting like a grownup.

183
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:14,625
Man. With a speech like that,
I almost believed you.

184
00:08:14,708 --> 00:08:16,208
[grunts]

185
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:17,791
[JUNICHIRO] How about you stop
acting like the daughter of KMC,

186
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,000
and start acting
like a teenager?

187
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:21,458
Once you're back
to your old self,

188
00:08:21,541 --> 00:08:23,916
tell me again what
you want to do.

189
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,958
[gasps]

190
00:08:26,208 --> 00:08:28,416
What I really want is
to achieve my dream.

191
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:31,791
To work with the man I love to
make our company successful.

192
00:08:31,875 --> 00:08:34,333
That doesn't include
a company takeover.

193
00:08:34,416 --> 00:08:36,041
Especially if it
includes a marriage

194
00:08:36,125 --> 00:08:38,500
to someone I don't
love let alone like.

195
00:08:38,583 --> 00:08:39,958
I can't stand the thought.

196
00:08:40,041 --> 00:08:42,375
Then you need to sit back
and let me do my thing.

197
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:45,333
Part of being a grownup is
giving kids what they want.

198
00:08:45,416 --> 00:08:46,875
Leave it to me.

199
00:08:48,625 --> 00:08:50,250
[MADOKA] Shouldn't you
be taking your lunch break

200
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:51,666
right about now?

201
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:54,125
Nah, we've got more important
business to attend to.

202
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,458
Like preparing for
tonight's fight!

203
00:08:56,541 --> 00:08:57,791
But I need help,

204
00:08:57,875 --> 00:09:00,041
and the only one who can
provide it is right here.

205
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:02,875
[KISAKI]
Hm? What's up, Junichiro?

206
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,541
You got a second?
I need a favor.

207
00:09:05,625 --> 00:09:06,750
[STUDENTS chatter]

208
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:07,750
[KISAKI]
Interesting!

209
00:09:07,833 --> 00:09:09,541
Talk about blood
boiling material.

210
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:10,750
But, yeah, I can teach you.

211
00:09:10,833 --> 00:09:12,000
I've played quite
a bit of King--

212
00:09:12,083 --> 00:09:13,375
Oh, no.

213
00:09:13,458 --> 00:09:15,208
I don't need training.
I need to borrow a console.

214
00:09:15,291 --> 00:09:16,916
[KIRIKO] Mr. Kagami called
asking for my help! 

215
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,000
[KANAN]
Why would he call you--

216
00:09:18,083 --> 00:09:19,666
[KIRIKO]
Just go away!

217
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,791
[BOTH gasp]

218
00:09:23,875 --> 00:09:25,750
Well that was weird.

219
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,000
[JUNICHIRO] So that about
covers the basics.

220
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,958
Other than that,
do whatever you want.

221
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:33,875
Sure!

222
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:34,583
--Sounds fun.
--Sounds fun.

223
00:09:34,666 --> 00:09:36,791
Okay, then! Let's fight.

224
00:09:36,875 --> 00:09:38,333
Can they really help you train?

225
00:09:38,416 --> 00:09:39,541
[JUNICHIRO]
Huh?

226
00:09:39,625 --> 00:09:40,791
[KISAKI] It's just they
don't seem too aware

227
00:09:40,875 --> 00:09:42,708
of what they're doing.
We're having a hard time

228
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:44,208
believing they're
good at this game.

229
00:09:44,291 --> 00:09:45,458
They're not.

230
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:47,666
In fact, they've never
even played it before.

231
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,250
[KISAKI] Are you for real?
There's no way you're gonna get

232
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,125
enough practice
against amateurs.

233
00:09:52,208 --> 00:09:55,458
On the contrary, amateurs are
exactly what I need.

234
00:09:59,208 --> 00:10:00,541
[KANAN]
We can work together for now,

235
00:10:00,625 --> 00:10:02,125
but you're not
gonna drag me down.

236
00:10:02,208 --> 00:10:04,541
This is for Mr. Kagami, so you'd
better pull your weight!

237
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:07,541
[KIRIKO gasps] I liked you
better when you didn't talk.

238
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:11,458
[KANAN]
Okay. I see the enemy.

239
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,166
I just have to get
closer to him now.

240
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:15,916
[KANAN]
Oh, how do I run again?

241
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
I-I think it was this button?

242
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,541
[KANAN groans]

243
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:22,250
[KIRIKO] So is that what
you were going for?

244
00:10:22,333 --> 00:10:23,708
[KANAN] It's a lot
harder than it looks!

245
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,291
I don't see you doing anything!

246
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:29,083
[KIRIKO laughs] It's literally
just using a joystick to walk.

247
00:10:29,166 --> 00:10:31,166
I think I'll be fine,
thank you very much.

248
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:33,208
Besides, I do harder
stunts as Ra--

249
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,375
Whoops, silly me.

250
00:10:34,458 --> 00:10:36,333
I almost let out a secret!

251
00:10:36,416 --> 00:10:37,750
[giggles]

252
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,250
[JUNICHIRO] She can't seriously
believe her identity as

253
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,791
Razor Girl is still a mystery
to her classmates, right?

254
00:10:41,875 --> 00:10:44,541
I mean, it's not like she
wears a mask or anything.

255
00:10:44,625 --> 00:10:46,375
[KIRIKO]
Here comes the pain!

256
00:10:46,458 --> 00:10:47,875
[KIRIKO yells]

257
00:10:47,958 --> 00:10:52,250
[KIRIKO groans]

258
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,625
[KANAN]
Oh, my! Are you motion sick?

259
00:10:54,708 --> 00:10:57,625
And after all the talk about
the hard stunts you do, too.

260
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,625
You can't help
Mr. Kagami like that.

261
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,875
Guess you're not the Hot Potato
you thought you were.

262
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,166
[laughs]

263
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:04,166
[yelps]

264
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,875
[KIRIKO]
Sorry. My finger slipped.

265
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,416
[KANAN grunts]
Oops!

266
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:11,291
I don't know what any
of these buttons do!

267
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,458
[KIRIKO]
Oh, no! I slipped again!

268
00:11:13,541 --> 00:11:15,416
Sorry, I was trying
to bring up the map

269
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,333
and I pulled the
trigger on accident!

270
00:11:17,416 --> 00:11:20,125
So, at this rate, there's
no way either one of them

271
00:11:20,208 --> 00:11:22,166
will come over here
to fight you.

272
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,291
Are you sure this
is good practice?

273
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:25,916
I'm gonna go give
'em some pointers.

274
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,583
No. Don't.

275
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:29,708
[bickering continues]

276
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:30,875
They're doing fine.

277
00:11:30,958 --> 00:11:33,375
It's exactly what
I wanted to see.

278
00:11:36,208 --> 00:11:38,041
[CUSTOMER A] This thing's
about to start, right?

279
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,291
[CUSTOMER B]
Should be.

280
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,958
[CROWD chatters]

281
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:42,791
[CUSTOMER C]
There's Hell Gates!

282
00:11:42,875 --> 00:11:46,416
I can't believe the King Halo
World Champion is really here!

283
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:49,125
You think I'd look cool
if I wore shades like him?

284
00:11:59,375 --> 00:12:02,916
[GATES] Hm! I see the King
Halo 3 cabinets arrived.

285
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,000
But it's not too late to
pick a different game.

286
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,625
No, I want to
dethrone you at this.

287
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,875
Then our match style
will be Team Battle,

288
00:12:09,958 --> 00:12:13,875
one player commanding
ten NPCs per side.

289
00:12:13,958 --> 00:12:15,458
[STUDENTS sigh]

290
00:12:18,166 --> 00:12:21,250
Hey, Madoka! I hope
you've packed your bags.

291
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,958
We'll be leaving for the
U.S. right after this.

292
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,833
[groans]

293
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,083
Alright. It's time
to start the lesson!

294
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,958
[CROWD cheers]

295
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:51,250
[GATES] Two enemies
at my eleven o'clock.

296
00:12:51,333 --> 00:12:53,291
Both out of range.

297
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:56,416
Alright. Primary weapon
change from Plasma Pistol

298
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,291
to Beam Assault Rifle.

299
00:13:00,625 --> 00:13:02,500
The champ is
making his move!

300
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,041
This looks bad.

301
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:10,541
Quit fooling around.

302
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:12,375
Your allied forces
are dwindling!

303
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,250
You need to get your
head in the game!

304
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,666
[MADOKA]
What in the world?

305
00:13:15,750 --> 00:13:19,541
Why is he playing like
Kiriko and Kanan?

306
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,583
[GATES]
Finally found you, Junichiro!

307
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:24,125
I think it's about time
I humbled your bundle!

308
00:13:24,208 --> 00:13:25,000
Heh.

309
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,375
[gasps]

310
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,791
[GATES]
What the heck is going on?

311
00:13:29,875 --> 00:13:31,916
I didn't write any code
for weapon vanishing.

312
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,916
That isn't supposed to happen!

"I am Error."

[GATES gasps]

315
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:38,875
Unreleased software tends
to have glitches like this

316
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:41,125
when the user
behaves unexpectedly.

317
00:13:41,208 --> 00:13:43,458
I'm surprised you don't
have a workaround.

318
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:46,541
Maybe you're not such a
genius programmer after all.

[GATES]
What's going on with my legs?

321
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:51,916
I can't move my character!

Isn't there a saying,

324
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,958
"all's fair in love and war"?

325
00:13:58,041 --> 00:13:59,750
How appropriate.

326
00:13:59,833 --> 00:14:02,958
This match is crazy.
So many bugs!

327
00:14:03,041 --> 00:14:04,375
But, why?

328
00:14:04,458 --> 00:14:06,916
By performing in-game actions
inspired by amateurs,

329
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:09,416
he's able to exploit
vulnerabilities in the code.

330
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:11,041
Talk about dirty.

331
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,083
I've never seen
anything like it.

332
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,000
Of course not. No one has.

333
00:14:15,083 --> 00:14:17,666
Because there's no way to
predict what he's going to do.

334
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,458
It's a fact of life when
dealing with Junichiro.

335
00:14:21,208 --> 00:14:22,708
[JUNICHIRO gasps]

336
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:24,666
[JUNICHIRO] Looks like
I'm not immune to it myself.

337
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:28,000
Guess it's time for Plan B!

338

Where are you going?

[GATES gasps]

340
00:14:33,916 --> 00:14:35,833
[GATES]
The heck did that come from?

341
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,208
[GATES]
There's no way.

342
00:14:39,291 --> 00:14:41,375
The buildings on this
map are just obstacles,

343
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:43,125
you shouldn't be
able to enter them!

344
00:14:43,208 --> 00:14:44,125
[JUNICHIRO]
Thanks to the glitch,

345
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,958
I was able to clip
myself up here.

346
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:48,416
Think of it as a higher
plane of existence.

347
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:49,750
Like you're enlightened?

348
00:14:49,833 --> 00:14:51,083
Gimme a break.

349
00:14:51,166 --> 00:14:53,375
You're just standing in a
weird place, that's all!

350
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,375

You think I can't snipe you?

00:14:57,750 --> 00:14:59,833
What? I'm still bugged?

353

Why didn't your gun
disappear this time?

354
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:05,041
[JUNICHIRO]
"Higher plane of existence."

355
00:15:05,125 --> 00:15:07,958
That lower area is
overrun with errors now,

356
00:15:08,041 --> 00:15:10,166
making it a no-guns zone.

357
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:12,791
But I'm literally on
a different plane.

358
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:16,208
And up here, I have the
full right to bear arms!

[GATES]
Little punk!

362
00:15:25,125 --> 00:15:26,916
[JUNICHIRO] I've done
a lot of QA testing

363
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,583
for different video game
companies in the past.

[grunts]

365
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:33,625
[JUNICHIRO] And if I learned one
thing from that experience,

366
00:15:33,708 --> 00:15:35,875
you have to be
prepared for anything.

367
00:15:35,958 --> 00:15:37,875
Because you never know
what's going to happen

368
00:15:37,958 --> 00:15:40,000
when the game breaks around you.

[gasps]

370
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,458

that wasn't in your manual.

371
00:15:47,541 --> 00:15:49,250
Was it, your highness?

Boom. Winning.

374
00:15:57,750 --> 00:15:59,458
I can't believe this happened.

375
00:15:59,541 --> 00:16:01,291
But a duel is a duel.

376
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:04,958
I will accept my
defeat like a man.

377
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:07,458
I'm abandoning KMC
per your terms.

However...

380
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:13,166
I demand we have a rematch.

381
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:15,666
This time on King Halo 2.

382
00:16:15,750 --> 00:16:17,875
The version both of
us have mastered.

383
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:19,625
Where nothing can hold us back.

384
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:20,875
No bugs or glitches.

385
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,750
This round will be
decided solely on skill.

386
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,833
Put your honor as a
gamer on the line.

387

[JUNICHIRO]
Hm. Nah, I'm going home.

388
00:16:29,875 --> 00:16:31,166
As I expected.

389
00:16:31,250 --> 00:16:33,375
I knew you couldn't be
content with such a cheap--

390
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:35,000
Wait, you're leaving?!

391
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:37,375
Yeah, of course I am.
I got what I wanted.

392
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:40,708
And besides, Cased Closed
is coming on. Bye.

393
00:16:40,791 --> 00:16:41,958
Hold on!

394
00:16:42,041 --> 00:16:43,708
I can't end things this way.

395
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,541
Not until I've proven
to everyone here

396
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:48,041
my FPS skills are
superior to yours.

397

I'll show you why
I'm the world champ.

You're worse than Hercule.

I'm ready for him now.

Doesn't matter what kind
of tricks he tries to pull.

00:17:07,958 --> 00:17:08,916
[GATES]
What?!

403
00:17:11,375 --> 00:17:14,041
[GATES]
Sniper! Fan out, and find him!

404
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,625
[GATES grunts]
He's destroyed half my NPCs!

405
00:17:21,708 --> 00:17:23,583
Where is his fire coming from?

00:17:23,666 --> 00:17:25,416
[grunts]

407
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,208
There's no way he's
already got a lock on me!

408
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:31,125
[GATES]
I can't let him pin me down!

[GASPS grunts]

00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:35,750
[GATES scoffs]
He's toying with me.

411
00:17:35,833 --> 00:17:36,958
This is bad.

00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,625
Gotta hurry and take
control of this fight!

[gasps]

414
00:17:44,125 --> 00:17:45,666
[GATES]
He's predicted everything.

415
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:49,750
My moves, the NPCs,
he had it all figured out!

416
00:17:56,166 --> 00:17:58,083
[GATES]
He's in a league all his own!

417
00:17:58,166 --> 00:17:59,625
I'm the king and this peasant

418
00:17:59,708 --> 00:18:02,750
is about to dethrone me
without breaking a sweat!

419
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:07,208
[GATES]
But it isn't over yet.

420
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:09,708
I became the King of
Games for a reason.

421
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,208
And I won't let him
shame my title!

422
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,583
[GATES] It's time we
finished this, Junichiro!

[JUNICHIRO] Discarding his
armor to increase his speed.

425
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,625
That's a smart call
given his situation.

426
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:31,458
With guts and quick
thinking like that,

427
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:33,458
it's no wonder he
became a champion.

By beating you with glitches,

434
00:18:58,250 --> 00:19:01,500
you had the benefit of the doubt
that I wasn't as skilled as you.

00:19:01,583 --> 00:19:03,583
I didn't see that.

I have to admit. I am
impressed by your skills.

442
00:19:20,291 --> 00:19:22,708
Why haven't I ever seen you
compete in a tournament?

443
00:19:22,791 --> 00:19:26,041
Why? Because I don't think
games are for competition.

444
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,291
They're for having fun.

445
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:29,875
Makes sense.

[MADOKA]
Hey, Gates!

447
00:19:31,583 --> 00:19:33,083
[GATES]
Hm?

448
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:35,833
[MADOKA] He won fair and square,
so don't act like a sore loser!

449
00:19:35,916 --> 00:19:39,458
That's hurtful. I told him
he's the better player.

450
00:19:39,541 --> 00:19:41,958
[MADOKA] Wait.
You aren't mad he beat you?

451
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:43,500
No. I'm not.

452
00:19:43,583 --> 00:19:46,166
Actually, I'm happy about it,
because now the woman I love

453
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:48,041
can be with a man
of her choosing.

454
00:19:48,125 --> 00:19:49,958
Now I think I want
you even more.

455
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:51,291
How about that?

456
00:19:51,375 --> 00:19:52,541
[gasps]

457
00:19:52,625 --> 00:19:55,166
Hold on! You said you
were giving up on me!

458
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,541
Now you're not?

459
00:19:56,625 --> 00:19:59,041
I agreed to give up on
the political marriage,

460
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,166
but I'll never quit trying
to win your heart.

461
00:20:01,250 --> 00:20:03,416
Oh. What am I gonna do?

462
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,083
[SUZUNE] Y'know,
seeing them like this

463
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:08,333
makes me think they'd
be a cute couple.

464
00:20:08,416 --> 00:20:11,833
And that concludes
today's lesson.

465
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,333
Y'know what?

466
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:17,333
Even though he's my rival,
I don't know a thing about him.

467
00:20:17,416 --> 00:20:20,375
How did you meet
this guy, anyway?

468
00:20:20,458 --> 00:20:22,625
Well, he's a teacher.

469
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:25,708
The most interesting
one at my school.

470
00:20:28,833 --> 00:20:31,458
[JUNICHIRO] So I'm guessing you
met Gates in a random encounter?

471
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,708
[MADOKA] Sort of. At the
big Game Expo last year,

472
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:34,916
he was running his mouth

473
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,833
about how the Japanese
industry is doomed.

474
00:20:36,916 --> 00:20:38,333
I gave him a piece of my mind

475
00:20:38,416 --> 00:20:39,583
and then he started
talking about

476
00:20:39,666 --> 00:20:41,583
"needing me so he can
become a true king."

477
00:20:41,666 --> 00:20:42,666
So weird.

478
00:20:42,750 --> 00:20:44,083
Who knows what he meant?

479
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,166
Guy's nuts.

480
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:47,375
Well, it makes
perfect sense to me.

481
00:20:47,458 --> 00:20:50,541
Everyone he knows just tells
him what he wants to hear,

482
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:52,000
but you were honest with him.

483
00:20:52,083 --> 00:20:53,541
[MADOKA gasps]

484
00:20:53,625 --> 00:20:55,375
[JUNICHIRO] A person who
can do something like that

485
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:59,458
when no one else will is
worth their weight in gold.

486
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:01,041
And when you find that person,

487
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:04,041
you'll do anything you possibly
can to be with them.

488
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,291
[MADOKA]
Hey, uh.

489
00:21:07,375 --> 00:21:09,750
Do you know what it was that
made me fall in love with you?

490
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,416
[JUNICHIRO]
No?

491
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:14,750
I had gotten pretty curious
about how much you were worth.

492
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,875
Being a famous
troublemaker and all.

493
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:22,666
Come to find out...
I couldn't see your number.

494
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:25,083
That was a first for me.

495
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:26,708
I didn't know what
it was at the time,

496
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:30,750
but something about
you is... priceless.

497
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:32,041
[JUNICHIRO]
Hm?

498
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:34,041
[BOTH grunt]

499
00:21:34,125 --> 00:21:35,541
Hey!

500
00:21:35,625 --> 00:21:37,083
[MADOKA]
So you're right,

501
00:21:37,166 --> 00:21:42,500
I'll do anything I can to be
with you, until you marry me.

502
00:21:42,583 --> 00:21:43,583
That's my goal.

503
00:21:43,666 --> 00:21:46,166
You're stuck with me,
like it or not!

504
00:21:46,250 --> 00:21:47,708
[JUNICHIRO whimpers]

505
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:49,125
Bye, darlin'.

506
00:21:49,208 --> 00:21:51,750
See you later!

507
00:21:51,833 --> 00:21:53,416
[chuckles]

508
00:23:30,708 --> 00:23:32,166
[GATES] This is the
genius programmer

509
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:35,500
and King of Games, Hell Gates!
I'm sure you've heard of me.

510
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:38,250
Junichiro. You could be so
much more than a teacher,

511
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:40,000
why waste your potential?

512
00:23:40,083 --> 00:23:42,333
Next episode, my rival
has to clean up

513
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:44,666
a sealed-off boarding
house within the school.

514
00:23:44,750 --> 00:23:46,875
And weird things happen
the whole time.

515
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:51,458
[GATES yells] Period sixteen,
"Take Me to the Afterlife."

516
00:23:51,541 --> 00:23:53,541
As if a CEO's daughter
wasn't enough,

517
00:23:53,625 --> 00:23:55,125
now there's this ghost girl?

518
00:23:55,208 --> 00:23:57,291
Guess being a teacher
isn't that easy.
