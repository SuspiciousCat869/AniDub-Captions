00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,208
Hey! Don't change that channel!

2
00:00:09,291 --> 00:00:12,041
You're gonna love
what's next. I guarantee it!

3
00:00:12,125 --> 00:00:15,333
What do a juvenile delinquent
and a pop idol have in common?

4
00:00:15,416 --> 00:00:18,000
They're both getting
put on my lesson plan!

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:20,958
All teachers are looking for
diamonds in the rough,

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:23,916
and I Junichiro Kagami,
the Ultimate Otaku Teacher,

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,833
always find them first!

00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:49,541
[NARRATOR] Activating a
mysterious item left behind

9
00:01:49,625 --> 00:01:51,916
by their father,
five half-siblings now

10
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,791
defend the earth from
the evil forces of Nemesis!

11
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,416
[NARRATOR]
They are...

12
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,625
[FAMILY RANGERS] Fraternal
Force Family Rangers!

13
00:01:59,708 --> 00:02:04,666
[Family Rangers theme plays]

14
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:37,208
[JUNICHIRO]
Hey! What are you doing?

15
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:38,375
[SUZUNE] What does it
look like I'm doing?

16
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:40,625
I'm turning on
the 5th Queens Concert.

17
00:02:40,708 --> 00:02:43,250
[JUNICHIRO] Yeah, but I was
watching Family Rangers.

18
00:02:43,333 --> 00:02:44,750
[SUZUNE]
And now you're not!

19
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:46,416
That show's, like,
ten years old or something.

20
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,958
You can watch it on DVD.

21
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,875
This concert is live, so I can
only watch it right now!

22
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,458
But the Rangers
have a power and a force

23
00:02:52,541 --> 00:02:54,041
that you've never seen before!

24
00:02:54,125 --> 00:02:55,708
If it's a show
of force you want,

25
00:02:55,791 --> 00:02:58,666
I'm more than happy to oblige.
Just let me get my bat.

26
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:01,000
No! I'll just stream it.

27
00:03:01,083 --> 00:03:02,666
Man, would you
look at Komi-Ryu.

28
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:07,500
She's absolutely
amazing! And so cute!

29
00:03:08,666 --> 00:03:11,291
[JUNICHIRO] The power did
not protect us today.

30
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:19,583
Ugh. Will you please
hurry up already?

31
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,125
[JUNICHIRO] Remind me
again, what are we doing

32
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,583
out here exactly,
and why do I have to do it?

33
00:03:23,666 --> 00:03:25,041
Like I told you before,
there have been

34
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:27,416
a lot of reports of street
gangs popping up here.

35
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:29,291
And, given our positions
in the school system,

36
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,250
it's up to you and me
to prevent any kids

37
00:03:31,333 --> 00:03:32,583
from getting mixed up in them.

38
00:03:32,666 --> 00:03:34,166
I guess that makes sense,
but how exactly

39
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,625
are we supposed to keep them
from getting in trouble?

40
00:03:36,708 --> 00:03:38,166
By talking to them of course.

41
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,375
If they're obviously supposed
to be in school right now,

42
00:03:40,458 --> 00:03:42,250
then we just have
to convince them to go.

43
00:03:42,333 --> 00:03:43,375
And that means everyone.

44
00:03:43,458 --> 00:03:45,750
Even if they're not
from Icho Academy.

45
00:03:45,833 --> 00:03:47,916
Sounds like
a pain in the butt.

46
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,958
All right, it's time
to see what you've got.

47
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:54,500
But what do I say?

48
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:56,875
Start off by asking their age
and where they go to school.

49
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:01,958
Let's see. Go and
talk to that girl first.

50
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:03,666
Well, what are you waiting for?

51
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:05,458
[JUNICHIRO sighs]

52
00:04:05,541 --> 00:04:08,291
Uh, hey there.
Got a second?

53
00:04:08,375 --> 00:04:10,208
Do you mind if I
ask how old you are?

54
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,583
And what school you go to?

55
00:04:16,083 --> 00:04:17,541
Uuuh...

56
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:21,208
[MAKINA] You barely even tried!
Do I have to do everything?

57
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,708
Excuse us, but aren't
you a little young

58
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,166
to be hanging out on the street
in the middle of the day?

59
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:27,666
You should be in school.

60
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,583
Oh really?
Well you're one to talk!

61
00:04:29,666 --> 00:04:31,250
I was given permission
to be out here.

62
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,625
I'm on patrol!

63
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,250
Wow, that was nice
of your school to let you

64
00:04:34,333 --> 00:04:36,125
go outside into the real world.

65
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:39,166
You handling it okay?
You look a little scared.

66
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:40,791
[grunts]

67
00:04:40,875 --> 00:04:43,583
But seeing as you asked,
I'm fifteen years old.

68
00:04:43,666 --> 00:04:45,791
My name's Taki Komiya.

69
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:47,208
And here's my school.

70
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,791
[BOTH]
Huh?

71
00:04:48,875 --> 00:04:50,291
[MAKINA]
What are you talking about?

72
00:04:50,375 --> 00:04:52,583
This is just an arcade.

73
00:04:52,666 --> 00:04:54,583
If you take everything
at face value.

74
00:04:54,666 --> 00:04:56,083
--What?
--Think about it.

75
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,958
The only reason people
go to school every day

76
00:04:58,041 --> 00:04:59,416
is 'cause it's the
only place they get to see

77
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:01,500
all their friends and
have fun with them.

78
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:03,083
And I already do that here,

79
00:05:03,166 --> 00:05:04,833
so this is the only
school I need.

80
00:05:04,916 --> 00:05:06,375
That is complete nonsense.

81
00:05:06,458 --> 00:05:07,625
That is completely awesome!

82
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,250
What a great philosophy
to live by!

83
00:05:09,333 --> 00:05:10,875
Finally, someone gets it!

84
00:05:10,958 --> 00:05:12,583
You're supposed
to be on my side.

85
00:05:12,666 --> 00:05:14,000
But she's right.
Going to school's about

86
00:05:14,083 --> 00:05:17,083
more than getting book smarts!
I heard that on TV once.

87
00:05:17,166 --> 00:05:18,833
Have you forgotten
why we're out here?

88
00:05:18,916 --> 00:05:20,583
Oh man, is there
anything more lame

89
00:05:20,666 --> 00:05:23,000
than watching a fight unfold
between two old people?

90
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,375
[MAKINA] Watch your mouth,
street rat! I'm only eighteen!

91
00:05:25,458 --> 00:05:26,750
Worse than I thought.

92
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,666
Well. All right, I'm done
talking about this.

93
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,833
Don't you walk away from me!

94
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:35,500
Hey! What the--?

95
00:05:35,583 --> 00:05:38,000
She's gone.

96
00:05:38,083 --> 00:05:39,541
Everything okay in here?

97
00:05:39,625 --> 00:05:42,291
No, that girl just
disappeared into thin air.

98
00:05:42,375 --> 00:05:45,541
How about we split up for a bit
and you leave this one to me?

99
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,625
That way you can
go on patrol somewhere else.

100
00:05:47,708 --> 00:05:50,333
--[MAKINA] Mmm. Sure.
--[JUNICHIRO] 'Kay.

101
00:05:50,416 --> 00:05:51,916
But take this seriously, okay?

102
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,916
Like Avada Kedavra.

103
00:05:55,458 --> 00:05:58,333
[JUNICHIRO] It's safe.
You can come down now.

104
00:06:00,625 --> 00:06:02,708
Can't believe
you figured me out!

105
00:06:02,791 --> 00:06:04,250
[chuckles]

106
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:06,291
[JUNICHIRO] Like I haven't seen
that in a million cartoons.

107
00:06:06,375 --> 00:06:09,208
But actually seeing it in the
flesh was certainly a treat.

108
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:10,875
Pshaw! If you think
that was something,

109
00:06:10,958 --> 00:06:12,333
you should meet my sister.

110
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:14,708
She's got way cooler moves
than I could ever pull off.

111
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,000
I'm sure.

112
00:06:16,083 --> 00:06:18,250
Anyway, I need to really
get back to patrolling.

113
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:20,458
That sounds like fun!
Can I come?

114
00:06:20,541 --> 00:06:22,583
I definitely know this city
better than you do.

115
00:06:22,666 --> 00:06:25,333
I guess that's fine.
Sure, why not?

116
00:06:26,583 --> 00:06:29,875
[JUNICHIRO] Ooh. I never
knew there was a road here.

117
00:06:29,958 --> 00:06:31,625
Technically that's
because there isn't.

118
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,125
This is actually all part of
an abandoned factory.

119
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:36,083
I stopped going to school
when I was thirteen,

120
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,875
and I've spent most
of my time since then

121
00:06:37,958 --> 00:06:40,333
just drifting around town.
So I know all the secrets

122
00:06:40,416 --> 00:06:42,250
of this place
like the back of my hand.

123
00:06:42,333 --> 00:06:44,458
Meanwhile I've lived
my entire life in this city,

124
00:06:44,541 --> 00:06:46,625
but I never had a clue.
It's starting to feel like

125
00:06:46,708 --> 00:06:48,875
the teacher's
becoming the student here.

126
00:06:48,958 --> 00:06:52,041
In that case,
here's a few more life lessons.

127
00:06:52,125 --> 00:06:54,833
Every day that seafood
market changes its display box,

128
00:06:54,916 --> 00:06:57,833
which teaches which fish
are in season when.

129
00:06:57,916 --> 00:07:01,416
You can learn about dressmaking
at the used clothes store.

130
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:05,125
And you can meet musicians from
all over the world at that club!

131
00:07:05,208 --> 00:07:06,708
See what I'm talking about?

132
00:07:06,791 --> 00:07:09,291
I really do think of
this whole town as my school.

133
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,833
It's taught me everything
I know about the world.

134
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,500
And I wouldn't have learned
half of this stuff

135
00:07:13,583 --> 00:07:15,416
if I had been stuck
sitting in class each day

136
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,375
like a normal kid.

137
00:07:17,458 --> 00:07:18,916
[JUNICHIRO]
Hmmm.

138
00:07:20,791 --> 00:07:23,208
[TAKI]
Finally! Let's do this!

139
00:07:24,333 --> 00:07:26,041
This is heavy!

140
00:07:26,125 --> 00:07:28,875
I can't believe there's still
a Family Rangers claw game.

141
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,458
Yup, I was waiting
for my turn at it,

142
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:33,375
but I got sidetracked.
Cough-by you-cough.

143
00:07:33,458 --> 00:07:35,875
So you like Family Rangers?

144
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:37,541
Well, uh,
don't be hatin', dude.

145
00:07:37,625 --> 00:07:39,833
It's been on since
I was a kid. It's nostalgic.

146
00:07:39,916 --> 00:07:41,583
The Family Rangers
are five half-siblings

147
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,166
born from different
mothers and given powers

148
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,666
by an artifact
from their father.

149
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:46,625
A controversial team dynamic
that had never been explored

150
00:07:46,708 --> 00:07:48,166
in the Rangers'
past incarnations!

151
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,833
Because of that,
each episode's plot was able

152
00:07:49,916 --> 00:07:51,958
to juxtapose complex themes,
such as peace on Earth

153
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,708
against peace within the home,
in ways that resonated

154
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,125
with viewers of all ages.

155
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,125
In fact, it is so insanely
popular that it still airs

156
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:58,708

You think you have
enough tokens?

00:08:50,375 --> 00:08:52,125
They're from
the new gang in town.

178
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,333
They beat up anybody
they come across!

179
00:08:54,416 --> 00:08:58,041
But worse? It's filmed!
High def. To sell. Online.

Eeeh! Oh, please no!

187

and sold on the internet!

talkin' about, man?

189

Shut up and give me
your wallet!

Oh, man, the guys
from the arcade

200
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:38,458
[DELINQUENT 19A] Is everything
all right, Miss Taki?

201
00:09:38,541 --> 00:09:40,458
I'm fine. I didn't even
break a sweat.

202
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,125
[DELINQUENT 19B] Heh. Where'd
this guy come from, anyway?

203
00:09:43,208 --> 00:09:45,916
[TAKI] Who cares? He's just
some random loser.

204
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,125
[DELINQUENT 19A]
Yeah I see that,

205
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:48,875
so why did you run from us?

206
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,833
[TAKI] I just wanted
to have a little fun.

207

[JUNICHIRO]
Whaaat?!

208
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:55,958
You mean to tell me these guys
are friends of yours?

209
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,041
[TAKI]
Mhm!

210
00:09:57,125 --> 00:09:58,416
When were you
planning on telling me?

211
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,000
I thought we were dead for sure!

212
00:10:00,083 --> 00:10:01,583
You're fine!
You should have seen

213
00:10:01,666 --> 00:10:04,208
the look on your face, though--
it was hilarious!

214
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:05,708
This's messed up.

215
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,208
It's time I come clean.

216
00:10:07,291 --> 00:10:09,291
I'm actually the leader
of Black Oracle Neo,

217
00:10:09,375 --> 00:10:10,750
and if there's
one thing I can't stand,

218
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:13,083
it's letting something fun
slip through my fingers.

219
00:10:13,166 --> 00:10:16,583
Why don't you just admit it?
You had a good time.

220
00:10:16,666 --> 00:10:19,958
Black Oracle Neo?
Worst street gang name ever.

221
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:22,708
Every one of us are misfits.
For one reason or another,

222
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,541
none of us fit in at
home or at school,

223
00:10:24,625 --> 00:10:26,125
so we took to the streets
in hopes of finding

224
00:10:26,208 --> 00:10:27,666
our own place in the world.

225
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:29,708
Every person deserves
a place where they belong.

226
00:10:29,791 --> 00:10:31,083
If no one wants us around,

227
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,708
then we'll give that
to each other.

228
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:34,375
Guess that makes sense.

you're awesome, too!

with you today,

chillin' at the arcade.

239

Swing by whenever
you're in the mood.

240

After all, just 'cause
you didn't join us,

241

doesn't mean
we can't be friends!

Wait. How is it
you two know each other?

255

That's a long story,
but the cliffsnotes version is

he taught at
my school for a bit.

257

He's actually the one
who straightened me out

00:11:40,791 --> 00:11:42,500
and set me
on the path I'm on now.

Hold on a sec,
I need to talk to you.

I don't know why
you re-formed the group,

263
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,291
but I think
you should reconsider.

264
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:54,375
I kinda hate to
tell you this, Minako.

265

But, I only have time
for current team members,

Peace out. See ya.

Taki. You've probably
figured this out,

270
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,625
but Taki was
part of the gang I lead.

271

That was the original
Black Oracle.

00:12:12,166 --> 00:12:14,291
She worried more than anyone
else about her friends,

273
00:12:14,375 --> 00:12:18,041
and was the most upset
when I disbanded the group.

274
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:19,666
She's recreated
what I took from her

275
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:22,500
by finding kids who have
nowhere else to go.

276
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,958
I get why she's doing it.

277
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:26,125
But that life's
way too dangerous.

278
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,375
Her sister's a former member,
too, and she asked me

279
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,625
to help get Taki
off the streets.

280

But like you saw,
she doesn't listen to anyone.

Well, I think it's official.

[NAGARE ON PHONE]
Hi, Mr. Kagami?

323
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,625
This is Nagare Komiya. You met
my sister Taki the other day?

324
00:14:36,708 --> 00:14:37,791
Yeah, I did.

325
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,708
How did you end up
with my number, though?

326
00:14:39,791 --> 00:14:42,958
[NAGARE] Oh, well, Minako
put me in contact with you.

327
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,208
I was hoping we could
talk about my sister.

328
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,458
That's why I sent you
the invite to the concert.

I'm sorry I called you

But you're the only one
who can help me.

Whoa. Hold on a second.
You're her sister?

Then I'll get
right to the point.

342
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:19,000
I have to ask you for a favor.

343
00:15:19,083 --> 00:15:20,541
What kind of favor?

344
00:15:20,625 --> 00:15:22,833
Please convince Taki
to leave the gang!

345
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:24,958
It's awful. She just--

She refuses to listen to me
no matter what I say.

347
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:30,250
I know what Minako was like
back in the old days,

348

but you managed
to get through to her.

349
00:15:32,416 --> 00:15:35,500
That's why if anyone stands a
chance at saving Taki, it's you!

350
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:37,791
Yeah, but the circumstances
are pretty different.

351
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:40,083
And she does have the right
to do what she wants.

I understand that
I'm asking a lot of you.

00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,875
And I don't expect you
to do this for free.

354
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,750
Please! I'll give you
anything you want

if you do this for me! Anything!

356
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,833
But why does it matter
to you when you know

357
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,541
it means so much to her?

358
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,000
Come on, you used to be
a part of a gang, too, right?

359
00:15:55,083 --> 00:15:59,916
Well yeah, but it's dangerous
and I just get worried.

360
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,458
[TAKI]
It's "dangerous"?

361

[gasps]
Taki.

362
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,375
If I told you show business
was dangerous,

363
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:07,291
would that be enough
to make you quit?

364
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,875
'Cause I'm thinkin'
that's not the case.

365
00:16:09,958 --> 00:16:12,000
But then, I would never
say something like that,

366
00:16:12,083 --> 00:16:14,125
because I know everyone
belongs somewhere.

367
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,583
And once someone
has found that place,

368
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:17,125
they'll never be able
to live without it,

369

and no one has the right
to take it away!

[JUNICHIRO]
Hmm.

371
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,083
I've supported you because
I truly believe your place

372
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:25,083
has always been
in front of an audience.

So tell me.
Why are you trying to

374
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,958
take the place where
I belong away from me?

to hurt you at all.

doesn't exist anymore.

I know what I had is gone.

385
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:50,500
But as long as I'm around,
what it meant to me

will continue to live on.

as the only remaining

to side with you, so yeah!

I'm afraid I have no choice

but to join Black Oracle Neo.

to set a good example.

wants to do something,

they should do it. That's my
style "as a teacher."

If you're not going to tell us,

then there's
nothing left to discuss

I was worried about this.

414
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,291
I think after we started
hanging out here,

415
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,416
fewer people were coming by.

to be our spot!

But where are we going?

421

I know of an arcade
that's open twenty-four-seven.

422
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:40,166
Sound good?

00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,291
[DELINQUENT 19C]
I hate to tell you,

424
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,916
but this is just
an abandoned building.

425
00:18:47,125 --> 00:18:49,083
[JUNICHIRO] I thought something
like this might happen.

426
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:51,625
So, we've got a lot
of work ahead of us.

427
00:18:51,708 --> 00:18:52,791
You ready?

428
00:18:52,875 --> 00:18:55,250
Ready to do what?
You're not making sense.

429
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:57,166
[JUNICHIRO] We'll build
our own arcade right here.

430
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,875
[ALL]
You're kidding!

431

Finding a hangout
is whatever.

432
00:19:00,958 --> 00:19:04,166
But creating your
own place is way past cool!

433
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,166
[TAKI] Y'know, this team has
been together for a while now,

434
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:12,041
but we've never done anything
like an actual group before.

435
00:19:12,125 --> 00:19:13,250
It's kinda fun!

436
00:19:13,333 --> 00:19:14,750
[JUNICHIRO]
I'm glad to hear it.

437
00:19:15,708 --> 00:19:17,500
Hey, I was wondering.

438
00:19:17,583 --> 00:19:20,333
You don't hate your sister
or anything, right?

439
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:24,083
No, of course not.

440
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,750
Actually, we used to hang out
together all the time.

441
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,958
Ever since we were kids,
she wanted to be a singer,

442
00:19:29,041 --> 00:19:30,750
and I'm really happy
she was able to do it,

443
00:19:30,833 --> 00:19:32,666
even though she moved away.

444
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,333
With all the fame and fans,
you never thought of

445
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,375
becoming an idol yourself?

446
00:19:36,458 --> 00:19:38,583
Not at all. I'd sing
and dance with her

447
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,333
when she wanted
to play pretend, sure.

448
00:19:40,416 --> 00:19:41,875
That's what sisters do.

449
00:19:41,958 --> 00:19:44,541
But it never really caught
my interest outside of that.

450
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:46,666
I've always been happier
spending time with my friends,

451
00:19:46,750 --> 00:19:49,750
or just walking around town.
Stuff like that.

452
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:51,208
[JUNICHIRO]
Hmm.

453
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:54,250
This means a lot.

00:19:54,333 --> 00:19:55,708
[JUNICHIRO]

466
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:26,708
Better get ready!
You're going to be the face

467
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,166
of all our
advertisements coming up!

468
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:33,375
You should be excited.
What's the matter?

469
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,250
Oh, nothing.
This is a dream come true!

470
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,833
[birds chirping]

471
00:20:37,916 --> 00:20:40,083
[SUZUNE] Bro, there's an
emergency, come quick!

472
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,041
I'm here. Do you need
the first aid kit?

473
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:44,083
It's not me.
Komi-Ryu vanished!

474
00:20:44,166 --> 00:20:45,916
What do you expect
me to do about that?

475
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,500
I expect you
to be sensitive.

476
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:49,875
She's missing the interview
I want to watch!

477
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,500
Komi-Ryu will
be with us shortly,

478
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:54,208
and we apologize for
the unforeseen delay.

479
00:20:54,291 --> 00:20:56,166
I can't believe
she would do this to me.

480
00:20:56,250 --> 00:20:57,416
[door bell rings]

481
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,625
Bro, will you answer that?

482
00:20:58,708 --> 00:21:00,375
I can't leave
when Komi-Ryu needs me.

483
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:01,916
Okay!

484
00:21:02,708 --> 00:21:04,541
[JUNICHIRO]
Yeah? Can I help you?

485
00:21:08,875 --> 00:21:10,666
You said we should
do what we want.

486
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:13,291
Isn't that right?

487
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,208
Yeah, sounds like me.

488
00:21:15,291 --> 00:21:18,000
So what brings you
out here? Coulda called.

489
00:21:19,541 --> 00:21:21,541
I'm here because
you have to get Taki

490
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,541
to leave Black Oracle Neo!

491
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:26,875
Don't you see? You're the
only person she listens to.

492
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:30,750
So I'm not leaving
until you agree to help me.

493
00:21:30,833 --> 00:21:33,583
Hm. You're persistent,
I'll give you that.

494
00:21:33,666 --> 00:21:36,208
Aren't you supposed to
be somewhere right now?

495
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,083
Skipping an interview
for your sis. I'm shocked.

496
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:41,708
No, you've got it all wrong!

497
00:21:41,791 --> 00:21:43,791
I'm doing this for myself.

498
00:21:45,708 --> 00:21:47,750
If things stay
the way they are now,

499
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,291
well then, I...

500
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:53,291
I'll quit! I'll leave my job
as a singer for good!

501
00:21:53,375 --> 00:21:54,750
[JUNICHIRO]
Mmm.

502
00:23:30,125 --> 00:23:31,458
[TAKI] This is Taki Komiya,
the leader of

503
00:23:31,541 --> 00:23:34,000
Black Oracle Neo coming at ya!

504
00:23:34,083 --> 00:23:35,916
I'm really glad
Junichiro changed his mind

505
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,166
about joining us.

506
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:39,750
But I've got no idea
what my sister's up to.

507
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:42,250
Next episode, we're gonna
find out how Nagare

508
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,166
managed to land her dream job!

509
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,416
We're also gonna sing
the Family Rangers theme song,

510
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:48,250
which is a classic!

511
00:23:48,333 --> 00:23:50,791
Period twenty,
"The Twin Idol."

512
00:23:50,875 --> 00:23:53,375
Nagare, just forget about
what happened back then.

513
00:23:53,458 --> 00:23:55,750
I've already found
the place where I belong.
