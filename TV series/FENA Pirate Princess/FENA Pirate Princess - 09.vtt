It's north and west!

00:19:12.319 --> 00:19:14.388 position:13% line:5% align:start
Past and future
are also reversed --

00:19:14.421 --> 00:19:17.157 position:13% line:5% align:start
in other words,
flipped vertically.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:21.461 position:5% line:83% align:start
61 degrees west longitude.
34 degrees north latitude.

00:19:21.495 --> 00:19:24.866 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then, I think the numbers
are reversed, too!

00:19:24.899 --> 00:19:28.235 position:41% line:5% align:start
That would explain
why they're in Roman numerals

00:19:28.268 --> 00:19:30.772 position:52% line:5% align:start
instead of
standard Arabic!

00:19:33.041 --> 00:19:34.976 position:27% line:89% align:start
So...

00:19:35.009 --> 00:19:37.078 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's 14 degrees west...

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:39.080 position:5% line:89% align:start
and 63 degrees north.

00:19:39.113 --> 00:19:43.283 position:38% line:83% align:start
Mm-hmm! I bet that's
where Eden is, too!

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:45.285 position:21% line:83% align:start
However,
we don't even know

00:19:45.318 --> 00:19:47.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
if the song's
about Eden's location.

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.158 position:35% line:83% align:start
You know what? That's
probably reversed, too.

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.627 position:30% line:83% align:start
As in, I'm not actually
looking for Eden,

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.429 position:41% line:83% align:start
but that it's been
making me look for <i>it.</i>

00:19:55.462 --> 00:19:57.632 position:30% line:83% align:start
And each time I stumble
upon something,

00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:00.134 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have this feeling that
someone will let me know

00:20:00.168 --> 00:20:01.836 position:50% line:83% align:start
if I've made
the right choice.

00:20:01.869 --> 00:20:03.403 position:5% line:89% align:start
And who would that be?

00:20:03.437 --> 00:20:07.108 position:24% line:83% align:start
We'll find out. Let's go.

I'll find those answers in Eden.

That is what
I've come to believe.

00:21:25.253 --> 00:21:26.854 position:7% line:89% align:start
Because when I think about it,

to all of you.

I won't let you down!
