The powers that be
have frantically

00:09:56.434 --> 00:09:59.367 position:5% line:83% align:start
been searching for it
for many centuries now.

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:00.400 position:16% line:89% align:start
A vast temple

concealing a treasure
that can rule the world.

00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
Some call it
the Vault of the Earth.

00:10:07.801 --> 00:10:09.567 position:21% line:83% align:start
In short,
the treasures spoken of

So Eden...

00:10:27.934 --> 00:10:29.534 position:19% line:89% align:start
is our starting point.

00:10:29.567 --> 00:10:33.067 position:13% line:83% align:start
Our first order of business
is to reach it.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:35.000 position:21% line:83% align:start
As for the Houtmans,
they are a bloodline

00:10:35.033 --> 00:10:37.467 position:19% line:89% align:start
with deep ties to Eden.

00:10:37.501 --> 00:10:39.133 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey,
wait a minute!

00:10:39.167 --> 00:10:40.300 position:16% line:83% align:start
You're saying
the only reason

00:10:40.334 --> 00:10:42.501 position:16% line:83% align:start
we've served
the Houtmans is --

00:10:42.534 --> 00:10:44.567 position:33% line:83% align:start
The shipwreck
was purely coincidence.

00:10:44.601 --> 00:10:47.300 position:24% line:83% align:start
But over the course
of serving the Houtmans,

00:10:47.334 --> 00:10:50.501 position:21% line:83% align:start
we eventually learned
their connection to Eden.

00:10:50.534 --> 00:10:51.801 position:21% line:89% align:start
And then, of course,

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:54.300 position:33% line:83% align:start
10 years ago
came the <i>Hope</i> incident.

no longer with us.

For one reason!

00:11:19.234 --> 00:11:20.701 position:5% line:89% align:start
Because you are the key
