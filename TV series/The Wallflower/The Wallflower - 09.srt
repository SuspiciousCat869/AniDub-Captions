00:07:31,534 --> 00:07:35,580
so have some fun with
your friends until then.

168
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,916
(sighing)

169
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:39,334
Adieu.

170
00:07:39,334 --> 00:07:41,378
Hey there, what's wrong?

171
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:42,587
Huh?

172
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:45,382
Uh, hm.

173
00:07:45,382 --> 00:07:47,467
Isn't she beautiful?

174
00:07:47,467 --> 00:07:48,843
Though slender and fragile,

175
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:52,013
she has taken on all the
tasks of managing this hotel.

176
00:07:52,013 --> 00:07:54,015
I must do my best
to support her.

177
00:07:54,015 --> 00:07:55,600
This room is frigging huge!

178
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,893
Magnificent view!

179
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,020
And the open‐air
bath never closes!

180
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:01,272
Wow, they've got a
ping‐pong room too!

181
00:08:01,272 --> 00:08:02,732
Hey, stop ignoring me!

182
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:04,693
Why don't we all go
take a quick bath?

183
00:08:04,693 --> 00:08:07,779
‐Sounds good.
‐You guys.

184
00:08:07,779 --> 00:08:09,864
Huh, where's Sunako?

185
00:08:09,864 --> 00:08:11,282
Now that you mention it.

186
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,992
We definitely just saw...

187
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,369
...a ghost in the bath!

188
00:08:14,369 --> 00:08:17,330
She's got long, dark hair
and really pale skin!

189
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:18,456
Okay, ladies, all right.

190
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,791
Miss Sayuri, help!

191
00:08:19,791 --> 00:08:22,794
Um, excuse me, I'm afraid
that's our friend probably.

192
00:08:22,794 --> 00:08:25,130
And she's actually
human, most likely.

193
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:27,507
I didn't realize that
Sunako was in the bath.

194
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:29,008
Why does she always stand out

195
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,885
even though she
has no presence?

196
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:34,973
Finally, I'm finally alone.

197
00:08:34,973 --> 00:08:38,351
Hot springs are
indeed the best.

198
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:42,939
I don't know why, but
no one else is coming in.

199
00:08:42,939 --> 00:08:43,940
And I don't have to deal

200
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,400
with those creatures
of light in here.

201
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,652
‐Hi, Sunako.
‐Ah!

202
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:50,864
There's no reason
to be so surprised.

203
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:52,615
Anyway, I've come to ask you

204
00:08:52,615 --> 00:08:55,243
to hang out with Kyohei
as much as possible.

205
00:08:55,243 --> 00:08:57,037
Not gonna happen.

206
00:08:57,037 --> 00:08:59,164
Oh, please, Sunako,
please, you have to help me!

207
00:08:59,164 --> 00:09:00,582
Kyohei's in my way,
and I want to be alone

208
00:09:00,582 --> 00:09:01,708
with Takenaga no matter what!

209
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:03,835
I want to take a stroll with
him around the hot springs

210
00:09:03,835 --> 00:09:06,004
wearing our gana
and yukatas!

211
00:09:06,004 --> 00:09:09,591
It'd be just like that,
all nice and dreamy.

212
00:09:09,591 --> 00:09:11,718
Oh, this is so cute.

213
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:13,803
Well, in that case,
I'll buy it for you.

214
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:15,847
‐Huh, are you sure?
‐Of course.

215
00:09:15,847 --> 00:09:18,767
Try it on and let's
see how it looks.

216
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:20,769
What do you think, Takenaga?

217
00:09:20,769 --> 00:09:22,062
It looks great on you.

218
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,689
In fact, you're
totally adorable in it.

219
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:26,316
Oh, Takenaga.

220
00:09:26,316 --> 00:09:28,818
We're headed to a world
made just for us.

221
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:29,986
Now off we go.

222
00:09:29,986 --> 00:09:32,530
I'll go anywhere as long
as I'm by your side,

223
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,991
my darling Takenaga!

224
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:39,788
I was just kidding.

225
00:09:39,788 --> 00:09:42,248
But consider how it could
benefit you too, Sunako.

226
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:44,417
See, if I do become
Takenaga's girlfriend,

227
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:46,211
I'll move into the
mansion with you guys,

228
00:09:46,211 --> 00:09:47,754
and if that happens,
then I'll take care

229
00:09:47,754 --> 00:09:50,256
of all the housework for you.

230
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:53,426
And then you might
never have to leave

231
00:09:53,426 --> 00:09:56,763
your room again, Sunako.

232
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,599
(giggling)

233
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,810
♪

234
00:10:02,894 --> 00:10:04,562
So it's all settled then.

235
00:10:04,562 --> 00:10:08,024
I knew we'd be able to
come to an agreement.

236
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:11,027
(bubbling)

237
00:10:11,027 --> 00:10:13,488
I didn't know dinner was
already waiting for us.

238
00:10:13,488 --> 00:10:15,824
Please, allow me
to serve the rice.

239
00:10:15,824 --> 00:10:18,409
Oh, that shampoo
smells so nice.

240
00:10:18,409 --> 00:10:21,204
Takenaga, are you
happy or what?

241
00:10:21,204 --> 00:10:23,873
Uh‐oh, Sunako's
gone freaky again.

242
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,876
Hey, Noi, what the heck did
you do with her in the bath?

243
00:10:26,876 --> 00:10:28,294
‐Talk.
‐But why?

244
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:29,671
I don't know what
you're implying.

245
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:31,714
What could I do?

246
00:10:31,714 --> 00:10:33,383
There's no way I can be alone

247
00:10:33,383 --> 00:10:35,135
with those
creatures of light.

248
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,344
But if I overcome this,

249
00:10:36,344 --> 00:10:38,388
I'll receive my
eternal solitude.

250
00:10:38,388 --> 00:10:41,432
It's no use, I'd rot to death
before I could get that far.

251
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:44,936
But, no, if I think of the
possibility of the future!

252
00:10:44,936 --> 00:10:46,980
Oh, Sunako, here's your rice.

253
00:10:46,980 --> 00:10:49,274
Hey, we're gonna start
eating without you!

254
00:10:49,274 --> 00:10:51,484
Hiroshi, Akira, Josephine,

255
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:53,778
please help me,
give me your strength!

256
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,281
Wow, this sashimi
is totally delicious.

257
00:10:56,281 --> 00:10:58,908
Try it, Takenaga,
come on, say, "Ah."

258
00:10:58,908 --> 00:10:59,909
Cut it out, will ya?

259
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:02,787
Ah, don't you dare say
ah for him, Takenaga!

260
00:11:02,787 --> 00:11:05,957
So, what do you think
about the food here?

261
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:07,083
(gasping)

262
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:09,627
(whimpering)

263
00:11:09,627 --> 00:11:12,130
(grunting)

264
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:14,340
Ah!

265
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,967
Hey, Sunako!

266
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,929
I get to go to
sleep after dinner.

267
00:11:19,929 --> 00:11:22,432
I just have to tolerate
this part for now.

268
00:11:22,432 --> 00:11:25,727
So, um, Takenaga, um...

269
00:11:25,727 --> 00:11:28,104
(stammering)

270
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,024
Never mind, I'll
tell you later.

271
00:11:31,024 --> 00:11:32,525
You're acting weird.

272
00:11:32,525 --> 00:11:34,152
Eating and sleeping.

273
00:11:34,152 --> 00:11:36,404
Eating and sleeping.

274
00:11:36,404 --> 00:11:38,364
What, what the hell?

275
00:11:38,364 --> 00:11:41,659
You see, I don't like
these, so it's yours.

276
00:11:41,659 --> 00:11:42,911
Ahh!

277
00:11:42,911 --> 00:11:46,372
And, look, this one too,
oh, and this, and this.

278
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,333
Sunako, you can do it.

279
00:11:48,333 --> 00:11:50,543
(grunting)

280
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,172
‐Thank you very much.
‐Hey, Sunako,

281
00:11:54,172 --> 00:11:56,174
smile pretty for the camera.

282
00:11:56,174 --> 00:12:00,094
Oh, I just want to go
back to the room now.

283
00:12:00,094 --> 00:12:02,096
No, you can't do that!

284
00:12:02,096 --> 00:12:04,474
I've gone beyond my limits.

285
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:05,850
I'm gonna die.

286
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,977
I can't do this anymore.

287
00:12:07,977 --> 00:12:09,854
Sunako, what about
your promise?

288
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:11,022
What about me?

289
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,565
Ha‐ha.

290
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,525
Well, goodnight, everyone,
I guess I'll be going‐‐

291
00:12:14,525 --> 00:12:16,319
Where are you going?

292
00:12:16,319 --> 00:12:17,862
We prepared your futons.

293
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:18,863
Have a good night.

294
00:12:18,863 --> 00:12:20,531
Wow, those maids are good.

295
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,991
When did they do this?

296
00:12:21,991 --> 00:12:24,410
The night is
still young, honey.

297
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:27,705
No, it's not!

298
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:30,208
Hey, let's go play
some ping‐pong.

299
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:31,376
How cruel.

300
00:12:31,376 --> 00:12:33,044
I can't take this.

301
00:12:33,044 --> 00:12:37,173
I'm gonna go home back
to Tokyo right now‐‐ah!

302
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,884
Go home, huh?

303
00:12:39,884 --> 00:12:42,053
Hey, if you really want
to go home that badly,

304
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,514
how about you try to beat me
in a ping‐pong match?

305
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:46,182
Beat you at ping pong?

306
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,434
Uh‐huh, because I have
the key right here

307
00:12:48,434 --> 00:12:49,936
to the safety deposit box,

308
00:12:49,936 --> 00:12:53,439
and inside that box is the
money you need to get home!

309
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:54,857
I will fight you.

310
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:57,235
Let's go!

311
00:12:57,235 --> 00:12:59,237

Let's talk about etiquette

321
00:13:50,621 --> 00:13:52,415
when choosing a
ping‐pong paddle.

322

This'll work just fine.

Wrong, not to mention filthy!

If you're the type of
lady who goes for speed,

may I suggest this
extremely light

326
00:14:01,299 --> 00:14:03,760
and elegant fine‐grained
penholder racket?
