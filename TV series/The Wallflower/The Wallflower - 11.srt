How could you score three
percent on your math test?

Here, Sunako, try to
solve these problems

169

Takenaga wrote up for you.

170

What the hell, these
questions look crazy hard!

171

They're basic and they're
definitely going to be

173
00:07:44,589 --> 00:07:45,590
There's no way!

174
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:47,759
It looks like we're
in trouble now too.

175
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,135
Here you go, Sunako.

176
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,179
Just give it a try.

177
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:53,640

187

Here, I have
three Josephines‐‐

That's not her,
Josephine's a whole skeleton.

John's the one
with only a skull.

192

That's entirely beside
the point right now.

193

Now, look, there are
three Josephines.

194

I can't say how many
Hiroshis there are,

but there are five in total.

196
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,933
So tell me, how many
Hiroshis are there?

this is gonna work?

Correct, let's move on now.

In this next question,
Josephine is "Y"

Oh, Sunako?

Why don't you be a good girl
and come out of your room?

215

She's been in there

home from school.

This plan obviously
isn't going to work.

We should just give up
and pay the full rent.

Are you kidding me?

No way!

221

I don't even have enough
to pay the normal rent!

222

If that's how it is, I'll
make her study no matter what!

Huh?

If you want them back,

then score 80 points
on the math test!

229
00:09:37,786 --> 00:09:41,206
Shut the door!

230

Whoa, take it easy, Kyohei.

It's not like you're
any good at math either.

It's just that Sunako's
even worse at it than you are.

Come on, that's not fair!

236
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,345
Besides, if you
compare average scores,

237
00:09:55,345 --> 00:09:59,099
you have even lower
grades than she does.

I challenge you,
Sunako Nakahara!

80 points in math wins!

At this rate, things are gonna
lead to bloodshed, Kyohei.

from everything all the time!

247

For example, if something
happens that she dislikes,

248
00:10:18,368 --> 00:10:21,079
she just erases it from
her memory completely!

249
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,956
And, now, because she
doesn't like math,

250
00:10:22,956 --> 00:10:24,916
she's refusing to
even try studying.

She's always running away.

You worked really hard
for that math test

instead of running
away from it,

and I give you
full credit for that.

499

But that wasn't good enough.

500

You had to find something
else to run away from.

Don't you say that!

a pain, but...
