2

Let's see, first
I was kidnapped,

3
00:00:09,843 --> 00:00:11,345
and then some other
people broke in

4
00:00:11,345 --> 00:00:12,930
and kidnapped Kyohei, ne.

5
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:14,640
I'm not Kyohei, ne.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:16,558
At any rate,
I'm glad you were okay.

7
00:00:16,558 --> 00:00:18,143
To think they'd go that far.

8
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,770
It's not normal, is it?

9
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,481
No, I guess that's how
popular Kyohei really is.

10
00:00:22,481 --> 00:00:23,774
I'm a little jealous.

Jackass!

12
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,735
It seems Sunako is
the one who's been

13
00:00:26,735 --> 00:00:27,986
kidnapped this time.

14

Must be nice.

forgot about her!

Yeah, but he was
still cute though.

22

little boy, wasn't he?

23

I took this picture he‐‐

Don't take pictures
without asking!

25

He ran me over
with his tricycle.

To tell you the truth,
I was hurt pretty badly.

Yes, but more importantly,

what about Miss Sunako?

That's right, we have
to go find Sunako Nakahara!

Oh, you didn't know?

Your father took

away from home.

a huge swarm of girls

would descend upon our house.

The phone would be
ringing all day,

237
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:21,811
and Kyohei was
detained by the police

238
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,354
on assault charges
so many times

this man was living
elsewhere because of his job

00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,830
spending his time
flirting with young girls!
