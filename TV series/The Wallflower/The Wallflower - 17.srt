the slightest interest
in a girl like me.

165
00:07:28,573 --> 00:07:30,075
And I'm also quite
aware of the fact

166
00:07:30,075 --> 00:07:32,118
that he has
many girlfriends.

167
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:34,829
That Ranmaru's very kind,
so I suspect he's been

168
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:35,955
waiting for me to reject

169
00:07:35,955 --> 00:07:38,208
the marriage
proposal officially.

170
00:07:38,208 --> 00:07:40,210
And I've been taking
advantage of that fact

171
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:41,753
and prolonging
the amount of time

172
00:07:41,753 --> 00:07:43,797
before I give
him my answer.

173
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:44,673
Why is that?

174
00:07:44,673 --> 00:07:47,425
I'd still like us
to be connected somehow.

175
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:50,845
Even just as a would‐be
fiancée, he once met.

176
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:52,430
(grumble)

177
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:54,432
That's so sweet, but I'm
sure you're the only person

178
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:57,769
who seriously likes
that knucklehead.

179
00:07:57,769 --> 00:07:59,938
All right,
if that's how it is,

180
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,941
then I will make him stop
being such a ladies' man.

181
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:06,903
I swear I'm going to make
Ranmaru crazy about you!

182
00:08:06,903 --> 00:08:09,239
Oh no, you don't have to
do all that just for me.

183
00:08:09,239 --> 00:08:11,533
Stop being so timid.

184
00:08:11,533 --> 00:08:14,703
Because self‐confidence
makes a girl beautiful.

185
00:08:14,703 --> 00:08:16,746
You won't be a girl
if you're not polished.

186
00:08:16,746 --> 00:08:18,581
You must aim to
become the type of girl

187
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:20,959
that Ranmaru likes.

188
00:08:20,959 --> 00:08:22,502
Um, okay then.

189
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:24,212
Sunako, are you
ready to do this?

190
00:08:24,212 --> 00:08:26,047
‐Let's go!
‐Where are we going?

191
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:27,799
Yes, where are we going?

192
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:29,175
First we're gonna
visit a beauty salon

193
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:31,177
to achieve beautiful
skin and a great figure.

194
00:08:31,177 --> 00:08:32,178
Oh, a beauty salon?

195
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,307
Well, if that's the case
then... driver!

196
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,268
Driver, I would like you
to take me and my friends

197
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:40,520
to my mother's
company right away.

198
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,397
Certainly, madam.

199
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:44,357

200
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:46,317
Make yourselves
at home, ladies.

201
00:08:46,317 --> 00:08:47,318
Uh.

202
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:48,862
(giggling)

203
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,613
How fabulous,
I've always wanted

204
00:08:50,613 --> 00:08:51,823
to check this place out.

205
00:08:51,823 --> 00:08:52,782
And this beauty salon

206
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:54,492
is one of the
best spots in town.

207
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,828
This flirty bun‐mun is one
of the chestnuts you found?

208
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:58,496
No, that's not right.

209
00:08:58,496 --> 00:08:59,497
Oh, I knew that.

210

but I was...

211
00:09:02,125 --> 00:09:04,252
Well, ladies,
please come this way.

212
00:09:04,252 --> 00:09:06,838
Oh, that young lady's
with us as well.

213
00:09:06,838 --> 00:09:09,924

214
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,926

216
00:09:14,095 --> 00:09:15,221
Now, madam,

217
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,682

clothes and put these on.

Uhhh.

221
00:09:22,896 --> 00:09:24,939
I said take
off your clothes

222
00:09:24,939 --> 00:09:26,858
and put on these
special undergarments.
