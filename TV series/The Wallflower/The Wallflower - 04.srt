00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:05,201
♪

335
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:07,412
Okay, guys, it's
time for the festival's

336
00:13:07,412 --> 00:13:09,580
closing party!

337
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,373
No way!

338
00:13:10,373 --> 00:13:11,874
Will you please
stop saying that?

339
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,126
I don't want to do it!

340
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:14,419
Tie her up, boys.

341
00:13:14,419 --> 00:13:16,087
Aaah!

342
00:13:16,087 --> 00:13:19,424
You're the star,
you've got to look hot!

343
00:13:19,424 --> 00:13:21,259
Come on, it's show time!

344
00:13:21,259 --> 00:13:23,761
No wait, aren't we
gonna change clothes?

345
00:13:23,761 --> 00:13:25,221
No, because if we changed,

346
00:13:25,221 --> 00:13:26,597
how can we prove
that we were the ones

347
00:13:26,597 --> 00:13:27,932
in charge of
the haunted house?

348
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:31,060
I know that but can't
I change clothes at least?

349
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:32,895
Uh‐uh, sorry.

350
00:13:32,895 --> 00:13:34,397
I love wrap parties.

351
00:13:34,397 --> 00:13:36,190
Girls, girls, girls.

352
00:13:36,190 --> 00:13:37,442
I'm contestant number 25

353
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:40,486
and I'm going
to sing Freebird.

354
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:42,697
(boos)

355
00:13:42,697 --> 00:13:43,781
Just kidding.

356
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:45,324
Boys and girls,
this is the moment

357
00:13:45,324 --> 00:13:46,909
you've all
been waiting for,

358
00:13:46,909 --> 00:13:48,453
the announcement
of the school festival's

359
00:13:48,453 --> 00:13:51,205
most popular event contest!

360
00:13:51,205 --> 00:13:52,623
(cheering)

361
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,918
Maestro, can I
get a drum roll?

362
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:57,795
Hey, Noi, sorry we're late.

363
00:13:57,795 --> 00:14:01,007
Takenaga, where
have you guys been?

364
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:01,966
It's a long story.

365
00:14:01,966 --> 00:14:04,302
Shhh, he's about
to announce it.

366
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:06,846
And first place goes to...

367
00:14:06,846 --> 00:14:10,016
Class 1‐G's haunted house!

368
00:14:10,016 --> 00:14:13,478
Aaaah!

369
00:14:13,478 --> 00:14:14,687
(cheering)

370
00:14:14,687 --> 00:14:16,773
Congratulations, guys!

371
00:14:16,773 --> 00:14:18,649
So, how do you feel?

372
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:20,026
It was inevitable.

373
00:14:20,026 --> 00:14:21,235
That's confidence.

374
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:23,571
And where's your
star Nakahara hiding?

375
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:26,115
Oh she's‐‐not here!

376
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,201
Oh, maybe she
went to the loo?

377
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:31,579
But didn't I see her
just a second ago?

378
00:14:34,165 --> 00:14:36,584
Ah, too many people.

379
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:38,002
It's too many people.

380
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:40,546
And now the winners
of the Mori High School

381
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:42,965
king and queen contest!

382
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:46,177
(screaming)

383
00:14:46,177 --> 00:14:47,637
Huh, there
was a contest?

384
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,846
We didn't
hear about that.

385
00:14:48,846 --> 00:14:51,057
No, of course you didn't,
I just made it up

386
00:14:51,057 --> 00:14:52,183
so it's my choice.

387
00:14:52,183 --> 00:14:55,061
And my choice for
Mr. Mori High School is...

388
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:59,065
Kyohei Takano!

389
00:14:59,065 --> 00:15:00,316
Like I care.

390
00:15:00,316 --> 00:15:02,610
And he receives free
cafeteria tickets for a year

391
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:04,445
and 100,000 cash!

392
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:05,530
One hundred!

393
00:15:05,530 --> 00:15:07,865
That's right, and boy
was it a close contest!

394
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,700
And the deciding factor
was that runners up

395
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:11,202
Ranmaru Morii
and Takenaga Oda

396
00:15:11,202 --> 00:15:14,122
spent most of the day
hanging out with girls!

397
00:15:14,122 --> 00:15:15,998
Then I suppose
I'll never win

398
00:15:15,998 --> 00:15:18,084
because moi without
beautiful girls

399
00:15:18,084 --> 00:15:21,420
is like a day
without sunshine.

400
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:22,839
Takenaga's mine
and mine only,

401
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,549
you hear me!

402
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,633
Ah, Noi.

403
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:28,386
A hundred thou, a hundred
thou, a hundred thou!

404
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,512
Well, there you have it,

405
00:15:29,512 --> 00:15:31,639
the lucky Kyohei Takano
has won the title of

406
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,974
Mr. Mori High School!

407
00:15:32,974 --> 00:15:34,225
Objection!

408
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,394
We object to
the person chosen.

409
00:15:36,394 --> 00:15:37,395
And as class chairman,

410
00:15:37,395 --> 00:15:40,648
I refuse to
accept the prize.

411
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,233
I refuse because
those four idiots

412
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:43,901
aren't even
members of my class!

413
00:15:43,901 --> 00:15:45,570
What'd you say‐‐come up
here and we'll settle his,

414
00:15:45,570 --> 00:15:46,904
(indistinct screaming)

415
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,656
Kyohei, calm down.

416
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,700
Choosing Takano
as Mr. Mori High

417
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,826
don't make sense.

418
00:15:51,826 --> 00:15:54,412
He's the jerk who
caused that big explosion.

419
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:55,746
And he hurt
Pinky real bad,

420
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,332
he tried to
barbecue his face off.

421
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,792
We don't think
Mr. Mori High

422
00:15:59,792 --> 00:16:01,210
should condone violence.

423
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:04,005
Therefore, we're all
boycotting his selection.

424
00:16:04,005 --> 00:16:05,256
Stop complaining,
you jerks,

425
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,549
you're just jealous.

426
00:16:06,549 --> 00:16:08,593
You guys could never
compete against Kyohei,

427
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:09,844
not in a million years.

428
00:16:09,844 --> 00:16:11,262
That's right,
that's right,

429
00:16:11,262 --> 00:16:12,597
That's right, nay.

430
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:14,098
(together)
We're still boycotting!

431
00:16:14,098 --> 00:16:15,183
(together)
You're just ugly!

432
00:16:15,183 --> 00:16:16,642
(together)
Who are you calling ugly?

433
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,560
(together)
All men are ugly

434
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:19,437
next to Kyohei
and his friends.

435
00:16:19,437 --> 00:16:20,479
Especially you!

436
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:21,606
(together)
What did you say?

437
00:16:21,606 --> 00:16:23,149
(together)
You're just stupid!

438
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:24,275
(yelling)

439
00:16:24,275 --> 00:16:26,694
It's not my fault‐‐
this is my fault!

440
00:16:26,694 --> 00:16:28,279
We're ready to do
whatever it takes

441
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,699
to make sure that Kyohei
gets to keep his title.

442
00:16:31,699 --> 00:16:32,909
Booya!

443
00:16:32,909 --> 00:16:36,495
You lousy girls will
never beat us, so there!

444
00:16:36,495 --> 00:16:39,123
(yelling)

445
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,667
Oh, man.

446
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:43,586
Kyohei, what should we do?

447
00:16:43,586 --> 00:16:45,129
Do you think
I give a damn?

448
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,297
Kyohei?

449
00:16:46,297 --> 00:16:48,341
Let them do
whatever they want.

450
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:50,635

451

Gee.

452
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:53,846
Aaah!

453

Ah, the darkness
is so relaxing.

454

Skully, skully,
empty heads.

‐Sunako!
‐Huh?

456
00:17:01,145 --> 00:17:03,898
This is not the time
to be polishing a skull!

One of them
radiant creatures series!

458
00:17:06,108 --> 00:17:07,652
All right,
just come with me!

459
00:17:07,652 --> 00:17:08,653
It's not all right.

460
00:17:08,653 --> 00:17:10,488
(together)
We're not ugly!

461
00:17:10,488 --> 00:17:12,782
(together)
Yes, you are!

462
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,283
Are you all
right, my dove?

463
00:17:14,283 --> 00:17:15,243
I'm fine, thanks.

464
00:17:15,243 --> 00:17:18,162
Come on, Sunako, would
you stand up already?

465
00:17:18,162 --> 00:17:20,498
Aaah!

466
00:17:20,498 --> 00:17:23,626
Noi, are you alright, Noi?

467
00:17:23,626 --> 00:17:25,461
No, I'm not!

468
00:17:25,461 --> 00:17:27,421
But you can make
me feel better.

469
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:28,923
This is awkward.

470

‐It's very nice to meet you.
‐It's very nice to meet you.

471
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:32,593
I've been wanting to do
this since I first saw you.

472
00:17:32,593 --> 00:17:33,928
‐Me too.
‐Come on.

473
00:17:33,928 --> 00:17:36,055
Would you please hang
out with us later?

474
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,516
I'm really sorry,
but I'm kind of a guy.

475
00:17:38,516 --> 00:17:39,642
Aaah!

476
00:17:39,642 --> 00:17:43,521
Can we get this over with
so I can get my 600,000?

477
00:17:43,521 --> 00:17:46,023
(crowd rumbling)

478
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,401
What I don't understand
is why you're so hung up

479
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:49,402
on winning the money.

480
00:17:49,402 --> 00:17:51,779
Wouldn't it be easier
to just get a job?

481
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,447
It's not easier for me.

482
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:54,657
It isn't?

483
00:17:54,657 --> 00:17:56,450
No matter
what kind of job,

484
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,953
whether my boss
is male or female,

485
00:17:58,953 --> 00:18:00,913
I'm always
sexually harassed

486
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,832
by people where I work.

487
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:04,959
Thank you for
shopping J‐Mart.

488
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,752
Oh, Takano,
how would you like

489
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:08,296
to make some extra money?

490
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:10,131
I think you'd enjoy it.

491
00:18:10,131 --> 00:18:11,048
Uh?

492
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:13,467
Yes, I have some tubing
that needs to be laid.

493
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:15,553
I'll pay you double
what you make now.

494
00:18:15,553 --> 00:18:18,055
No, triple or more
with bonuses.

495
00:18:18,055 --> 00:18:19,807
Seriously?
Very seriously.

00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:21,892
But that doesn't
mean you won't love it.

497
00:18:21,892 --> 00:18:24,562
You've got to
be kidding me!

498
00:18:24,562 --> 00:18:25,730
Aah!

499
00:18:25,730 --> 00:18:28,357
Hey, you're one
hard working kid.

500
00:18:28,357 --> 00:18:29,233
Thanks, sir.

501
00:18:29,233 --> 00:18:31,152
If you want to make
some money on the side,

502
00:18:31,152 --> 00:18:33,404
I might be able
to help you out.

503
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:34,572
Really?

504
00:18:34,572 --> 00:18:37,033
Yeah, 'cause the more
I stare at it,

505
00:18:37,033 --> 00:18:40,536
the better your ass looks.

506
00:18:40,536 --> 00:18:42,455
Don't touch my ass,
you ugly‐‐

507
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,415
Whaaaaa!

508
00:18:44,415 --> 00:18:46,042
(crash)

509
00:18:46,042 --> 00:18:47,043
Takenaga keeps saying

510
00:18:47,043 --> 00:18:49,003
that I have to give
everything a chance.

511
00:18:49,003 --> 00:18:50,630
So every time
I get a new job,

512
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:52,715
I force myself
to hold it in.

513
00:18:52,715 --> 00:18:55,885
But it's like there's
a curse following me.

514
00:18:55,885 --> 00:18:57,136
There have even
been employers

515
00:18:57,136 --> 00:18:58,137
who love me at first

516
00:18:58,137 --> 00:19:00,097
because I brought
in customers, but‐‐

517
00:19:00,097 --> 00:19:02,224
Hey, Takano
what's on sale today?

518
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,643
(yelling)

519
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:05,603
No, I was here first!

521

Um, excuse me, ladies?

522

Aaah!

523
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:13,277
It's none
of your business!

524
00:19:13,277 --> 00:19:15,237
It always
ends up the same.

525
00:19:15,237 --> 00:19:16,947
The store gets full
of annoying people

526
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,825
who don't buy
anything and break stuff.

527
00:19:19,825 --> 00:19:21,786
So I keep getting axed.

528
00:19:21,786 --> 00:19:23,162
Really.

529
00:19:23,162 --> 00:19:24,830
Some things never change

530
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,208
and some things
aren't meant to be.

Meaning...

532
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:30,544
Meaning that the
real problem might be

533
00:19:30,544 --> 00:19:33,798

534
