I feel that way, too.

But you're so
incredibly cool, Sunako.

330
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:41,881
I really admire
how you can always say

331

what's on your mind.

332
00:14:42,882 --> 00:14:44,592
In fact, I envy you.

Let me tell you, you sure
saved my bacon this time.

341
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:07,657
Thanks to you,
my next exhibition

342
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,534
is going to be
a big success.

343
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:11,244
Uh, that's good, I guess.

344
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,121
Yeah, but about
that other girl,

345
00:15:13,121 --> 00:15:14,455
that Sunako
what's her name,

346
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,916
was something else,
badder than bad.

347
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,960
I mean, what
a complete rip off.

348
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,587
I've never seen
such an ugly model.

349
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,381
As I recall, you
asked her to be a model

350
00:15:23,381 --> 00:15:24,882
without even meeting her.

351
00:15:24,882 --> 00:15:26,384
I really don't
think she deserves

352
00:15:26,384 --> 00:15:28,177
to be talked
about like that.

353
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:29,887
But that's why
she's a rip off.

354
00:15:29,887 --> 00:15:31,180
Those photos
in that magazine

355
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,515
completely fooled me.

356
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:35,518
Who could have know
she was that ugly?

357
00:15:35,518 --> 00:15:38,104
She's so unpleasant
I can't even concentrate.

358
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,230
You know what I mean?

360
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:43,776
But that's okay,
now I've got you.

361
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,820
And once we're done here,
I've got a new concept.

362
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,989
We'll keep the
momentum and snap away.

363
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:50,074
Uh, what's wrong?

364
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,492
I quit.

365

366
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:54,537
Now wait a second.

What's that all about?

368
00:15:55,913 --> 00:15:58,332
Geez, what am I
gonna do with you?

369
00:15:58,332 --> 00:16:01,335
Hey, Yuki, you'll never
guess what we just did.

370

Huh?

371
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:04,046
Sunako, look,
they just told me

372
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:06,257
this place isn't
haunted anymore.

373
00:16:06,257 --> 00:16:07,258
Since that's the case,

374

would it be okay with you
if we went home now?

491
00:20:30,146 --> 00:20:33,274
I got an invitation
so I thought I'd drop by.

492
00:20:33,274 --> 00:20:34,734
Isn't it fabulous?

493
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:35,693
They're saying
that this will be

494
00:20:35,693 --> 00:20:37,653
one of his
greatest works ever.

495
00:20:37,653 --> 00:20:39,530
An absolute masterpiece.

496
00:20:39,530 --> 00:20:41,741
Hey, you give that back!

497
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,993
Your rent's behind
and your in arrears.

498
00:20:43,993 --> 00:20:45,286
I got hurt doing this.

499
00:20:45,286 --> 00:20:47,705
I got seven stitches,
a tetanus shot!

500
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,706
Doctor bills‐‐

501
00:20:48,706 --> 00:20:50,374
Sayonara, sucker.

502
00:20:50,374 --> 00:20:51,917
(together)
Sayonara money.

503
00:20:51,917 --> 00:20:53,961
(counting in Japanese)

504
00:20:53,961 --> 00:20:56,172
Now you listen
to me, lady!

505
00:20:56,172 --> 00:20:59,800
Why, look, it comes
to 500,000 even.

506
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,595
Ugh.

507
00:21:02,595 --> 00:21:03,846
She's a demon.

508
00:21:03,846 --> 00:21:06,056
I see a demon
in front of me.

509
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,433
I've got an
akasuri body scrub

510
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:08,559
appointment in Korea.

511
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:09,894
I trust that you'll
keep taking care

512
00:21:09,894 --> 00:21:11,228
of Sunako for me.

513
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:12,938
(speaking foreign language)

514
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:15,399
Ta‐ta, ciao, bye‐bye!

515
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,318
Darlings, you made it.

516
00:21:17,318 --> 00:21:19,820
I am forever truly
in your debt.

517
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:23,115
Thanks to you, this exhibition
has been a huge success.

518
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,575
The reputation of Kinoyama,

519
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,452
great international
photographer,

520
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:27,912
remains unblemished.

521
00:21:27,912 --> 00:21:29,413
Would anyone care if
I fit my anger

522
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:31,165
on this
sleaze ball's carcass?

523
00:21:31,165 --> 00:21:32,541
I'm not gonna stop you.

524
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:33,417
And by the way,

525
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:35,920
about your captivatingly
beautiful friend,

526
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:37,922
where is that
darling Sunako?

527
00:21:37,922 --> 00:21:39,340
These members
of the foreign press

528
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:41,592
have been asking for her.

529
00:21:41,592 --> 00:21:44,136
No, très bien, Sunako.

530
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,806
Beautiful, Sunako.

531
00:21:46,806 --> 00:21:49,350
Da da, kurasho, Sunako.

532
00:21:49,350 --> 00:21:50,893
Actually, now that
I think about it,

533
00:21:50,893 --> 00:21:54,104
we did force her to get
in the cab with us, but...

534
00:21:54,104 --> 00:21:56,607
Aahh!

535
00:21:56,607 --> 00:21:57,775
Aaahhh!

536
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:00,778
She's not here, she
didn't come with us, really.

537
00:22:00,778 --> 00:22:04,865
Yeah, she said she didn't
feel good or something.

538
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,742
Yeah, that's it.

539
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,410
(evil laughter)

540
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:10,454
I want it.

541
00:22:10,454 --> 00:22:13,040
Oh, baby, I want
I want it bad.

542
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,583
(laughing)

543
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:16,244
♪

544
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,467
I pledge no
more housework!

545
00:23:46,467 --> 00:23:47,593
No don't!

546
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,886
I need a button sewn.

547
00:23:48,886 --> 00:23:49,762
I'll do that.

548
00:23:49,762 --> 00:23:50,846
My shirt's wrinkled.

549
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:51,847
I'll do that.

550
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:52,681
I'm hungry!

551
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,474
I'll do that.

552
00:23:53,474 --> 00:23:54,767
He's like a robot!

553
00:23:54,767 --> 00:23:56,268
I'll do that.

554
00:23:56,268 --> 00:23:57,311
I'm so scared!

555
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,812
Next time on
The Wallflower,

556
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:00,064
Dreamy Halloween.

557
00:24:00,064 --> 00:24:01,815
I'll do, do, do, do.

558
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,400
She's such a weirdo!
