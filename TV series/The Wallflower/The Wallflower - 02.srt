1
00:00:06,423 --> 00:00:08,967
This is the story
of my friend, Sunako.

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,178
From what I've heard, those
nasty creatures of light

3
00:00:11,178 --> 00:00:13,680
are trying to turn her
into an elegant lady.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,057
‐Good luck to us!
‐Good luck to us!

5
00:00:15,057 --> 00:00:17,017
We can do it if we
put our minds to it!

6
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:20,771
We're gonna turn Sunako
into a respectable young lady!

7
00:00:20,771 --> 00:00:23,357
Oh, my heart hurts.

8
00:00:23,357 --> 00:01:51,486
♪

9
00:01:55,907 --> 00:01:57,951
(screaming)

10
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,411
No.

11
00:01:59,411 --> 00:02:00,871
Please, don't do it.

12
00:02:00,871 --> 00:02:02,622
Just close your eyes!

13
00:02:02,622 --> 00:02:04,583
And hold really still!

14
00:02:04,583 --> 00:02:06,335
No, no, no, no!

15
00:02:06,335 --> 00:02:08,003
Oh, quit wiggling, Sunako!

16
00:02:08,003 --> 00:02:09,588
Please let us cut
your bangs a little!

17
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:12,424
You don't wanna go to school
looking like this, do you?

18
00:02:12,424 --> 00:02:13,967
(screaming)

19
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,345
Look, I'm just going
to raise your bangs‐‐

20
00:02:17,596 --> 00:02:19,431
Aw, Sunako!

21
00:02:19,431 --> 00:02:21,141
(crying)

22
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,267
Oh, just lay off.

23
00:02:22,267 --> 00:02:23,560
If Sunako doesn't wanna change,

24
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,936
there's nothing
you can do with her,

25
00:02:24,936 --> 00:02:26,229
no matter what you try.

26
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:28,440
This is no time for
nonchalance, dammit!

27
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,941
What do we do about the rent?

28
00:02:29,941 --> 00:02:32,069
Oh, this is probably a
bad time to mention it,

29
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:33,737
but the plumbing
upstairs is broken‐‐

30
00:02:33,737 --> 00:02:35,405
I don't wanna change.

31
00:02:35,405 --> 00:02:37,115
I don't need to change.

32
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:38,950
You know, it would help
if you could tell us

33
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,619
why you don't wanna
show us your face.

34
00:02:40,619 --> 00:02:41,995
‐Yeah, tell us!
‐No!

35
00:02:41,995 --> 00:02:42,954
‐Say it!
‐No!

36
00:02:42,954 --> 00:02:45,791
‐I said say it, dammit!
‐No means no!

37
00:02:45,791 --> 00:02:47,709
Then say goodbye!

38
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:49,628
He jumps on the count of three!

39
00:02:49,628 --> 00:02:51,713
Three, two, one!

40
00:02:51,713 --> 00:02:53,465
All right, all right, I'll tell!

41
00:02:53,465 --> 00:02:57,094
There was a boy I liked,
and he said I was ugly and‐‐

42
00:02:57,094 --> 00:02:58,428
And?

43
00:02:58,428 --> 00:03:00,097
(crying)

44
00:03:00,097 --> 00:03:01,848
‐And?
‐And?

45
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:03,642
‐Is that all?
‐Is that all?

46
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,520
Until that day, I
worried about my acne,

47
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,814
went on diets and
looked in mirrors

48
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,316
just like any
normal teenage girl.

49
00:03:11,316 --> 00:03:16,154
But after that, if all of
that had gotten me nowhere,

50
00:03:16,154 --> 00:03:18,740
what was the point
in trying at all?

51
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,911
What was the point of
worrying about my face...

52
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,705
or being a girl ever again?

53
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:29,084
‐Oh, Sunako.
‐If I don't look in the mirror,

54
00:03:29,084 --> 00:03:32,963
I don't have to compare
myself to all those other girls.

55
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:35,382
Once you've learned
to look at it that way,

56
00:03:35,382 --> 00:03:38,385
it's so much nicer to be alone.

57
00:03:38,385 --> 00:03:39,553
I don't get it.

58
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,304
You're talking
about one guy, right?

59
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,057
Once is all it
takes, so get out!

60
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:46,852
Hmm, so she used to be normal.

61
00:03:46,852 --> 00:03:49,521
She shouldn't be so worried
about what other people think.

62
00:03:49,521 --> 00:03:52,065
I guess it shows how
much she liked that guy.

63
00:03:52,065 --> 00:03:53,984
What kind of jerk would
say something so cruel

64
00:03:53,984 --> 00:03:56,445
‐to a young girl?
‐Well, he must've been ugly,

65
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:59,364
because only someone ugly
would call an ugly girl that.

66
00:03:59,364 --> 00:04:01,491
Uh, guys, look at the time.

67
00:04:01,491 --> 00:04:03,994
Okay, do you wanna take
your bath first, Kyohei?

68
00:04:03,994 --> 00:04:05,996
‐Duh!
‐I think that's a yes.

69
00:04:05,996 --> 00:04:08,331
I've kept this
hideous face hidden

70
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:12,043
from the rest of the
world for two years.

71
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:15,964
Why would I ever want
to cut my hair again?

72
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:18,884
(crickets chirping)

73
00:04:18,884 --> 00:04:20,385
(sighing)

74
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:23,305
Why do I have to go
through this, anyway?

75
00:04:25,015 --> 00:04:27,809
And why do I hear
the shower running?

76
00:04:27,809 --> 00:04:29,603
The shower?

77
00:04:29,603 --> 00:04:33,440
(gasping)

78
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,567
(grunting)

79
00:04:37,819 --> 00:04:41,490
(quacking)

80
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:44,075
(screaming)

81
00:04:46,578 --> 00:04:48,163
I saw him!

82
00:04:48,163 --> 00:04:49,748
Oh, my God, I saw‐‐

83
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:53,752
That beautiful creature
must've seen my disgusting‐‐

84
00:04:53,752 --> 00:04:57,422
I was so horrified, I
just jumped out the window!

85
00:04:57,422 --> 00:04:59,382
(crying)

86
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,383
Well, I did tell everyone

87
00:05:00,383 --> 00:05:02,219
that we had to share
the downstairs bathroom,

88
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:03,678
but I guess Sunako
didn't hear that.

89
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,306
She might not have
heard, but she sure saw!

90
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,432
Did she?

91
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,810
Aw, gee‐‐but tell me.

92
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:11,102
Tell you what?

93
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:14,439
‐Did you see?
‐Hmm.

94
00:05:14,439 --> 00:05:16,274
(yelling)

95
00:05:16,274 --> 00:05:18,443
Put some clothes on, geez!

96
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,155
(screaming)

97
00:05:24,950 --> 00:05:27,536
Isn't he so cute?

98
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,745
What's all the commotion?

99
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:30,872
Nothing you should
worry about, loser.

100
00:05:30,872 --> 00:05:33,416
Ah, the sweet
welcome of princesses.

101
00:05:33,416 --> 00:05:34,584
(sneezing)

102
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:36,837
Are you sick‐‐it sounds
like you're catching a cold!

103
00:05:36,837 --> 00:05:37,921
It's nothing, okay?

104
00:05:37,921 --> 00:05:40,382
Look, all of them
are walking together!

105
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:42,926
I heard that all four
of them live together!

106
00:05:42,926 --> 00:05:44,803
That must be paradise!

107
00:05:44,803 --> 00:05:47,013
That's where I wanna be!

108
00:05:47,013 --> 00:05:49,933
Who's making that rackety noise?

109
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:51,810
‐Lassine!
‐Madeline!

110
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:54,145
‐Roxanne!
‐And Yvonne!

111
00:05:54,145 --> 00:05:59,860
The Goth‐Loli Sisters will
worship those beautiful boys!

112
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,488
At night, I'll seduce
my hottie Ranmaru nai!

113
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,157
And I'm gonna lay
with Yukinojoh nai!

114
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:09,244
Takenaga and I will soak
in the bathtub all day!

115
00:06:09,244 --> 00:06:13,498
And I'm gonna put handcuffs
on my beloved Kyohei nai!

116
00:06:13,498 --> 00:06:15,375
We are the ultimate
groupie gropies!

117
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:17,794
We'll make those boys
our shining trophies!

118
00:06:17,794 --> 00:06:19,671
‐Oh, yeah!
‐The Goth‐Loli Sisters‐‐

119
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,922
why are they here?

120
00:06:20,922 --> 00:06:24,050
How dare you lecherously ogle
my Kyohei nai and the others?

121
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,677
It pisses me off nai!

122
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:26,887
She's right‐‐royally‐‐

123
00:06:26,887 --> 00:06:29,014
‐Pissed off nai!
‐Nai!

124
00:06:29,014 --> 00:06:32,100
(yelling)

125
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,352
(grunting)

126
00:06:34,352 --> 00:06:36,688
(barking)

127
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:38,815
(crying)

128
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:43,904
Who is that sloppy
looking female?

129
00:06:43,904 --> 00:06:46,197
And why is she walking
so close to them

130
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:48,033
and disregarding our presence?

131
00:06:48,033 --> 00:06:49,951
Who does she think she is‐‐nai?

132
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,203
If you want this
spot, it's yours.

133
00:06:52,203 --> 00:06:55,540
‐Nai?
‐Nai?

134
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,584
For some reason,
an evil‐sounding voice

135
00:06:57,584 --> 00:07:01,463
suddenly echo‐echo‐echoing
around inside my head, nai!

136
00:07:01,463 --> 00:07:03,256
Oh, great beautiful
angel of darkness

137
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,383
who waits in the deep
dark underground of hell!

138
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,719
‐Goth‐Goth, Loli‐Loli!
‐Goth‐Goth, Loli‐Loli!

139
00:07:07,719 --> 00:07:10,221
Good morning, hello, boys!

140
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:11,389
(gasping)

141
00:07:11,389 --> 00:07:13,099
Hey, it's Noi!

142
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:23,735
♪

143
00:07:23,735 --> 00:07:25,737
Another radiant creature!

144
00:07:25,737 --> 00:07:27,238
Why don't you
handle this, Kyohei?

145
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:30,784
‐We've gotta get to class!
‐See you later, Sunako!

146
00:07:30,784 --> 00:07:33,787
Man, there's no chance for
us now that Noi is here!

147
00:07:33,787 --> 00:07:36,915
I don't wanna stay here
and be compared to her!

148
00:07:36,915 --> 00:07:39,084
The only way to
avoid comparisons

149
00:07:39,084 --> 00:07:40,960
is not to look at yourself.

150
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,630
So, you're name's Sunako, right?

151
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:45,590
...but I doubt
they'll even understand.

152
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:48,301
Hi, I'm Noi Kasahara‐‐
nice to meet you!

153
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:50,929
Ahh‐‐oh, my God, are you okay?

154
00:07:50,929 --> 00:07:52,263
Yeah, sort of.

155
00:07:52,263 --> 00:07:54,307
Happens when I run
into beautiful people.

156
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:55,517
Beautiful!

157
00:07:55,517 --> 00:07:56,810
Takenaga, did you hear that?

158
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,770
‐She said I'm‐‐
‐You're too late‐‐he's gone.

159
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,938
Hey, what's with your attitude?

160
00:07:59,938 --> 00:08:02,440
It's exactly the same
attitude I always have.

161
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:03,566

energy drink instead.

326
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:06,531
Here's a nice sports drink!

327
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:09,617
No, make it some ice cream‐‐
strawberry ice cream!

328
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:12,703
Here's your ice cream‐‐it
says Yukinojoh on the label!

329
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,332
Nope, now I want yogurt,
strawberry flavored.

330
00:15:16,332 --> 00:15:18,960
I found some yogurt, but
it said Takenaga on the box!

331
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:21,879
Maybe jam‐‐no, cancel that.

332
00:15:21,879 --> 00:15:24,006
Clean up the room, it's messy!

333
00:15:24,006 --> 00:15:25,883
Yeah, sure, whatever.

334
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:28,719
‐But don't touch anything!
‐Do I have psychic powers?

335
00:15:28,719 --> 00:15:30,221
‐Bring me my pajamas!
‐Okay!

336
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:31,514
Those clothes on
there need to be washed!

337
00:15:31,514 --> 00:15:34,225
‐Okay!
‐Now I want those strawberries!

338
00:15:34,225 --> 00:15:36,352
What unspeakable evil!

339
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:38,396
This creature of
light must be a demon!

340
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:40,648
Okay, this time I brought
strawberries, a sports drink,

341
00:15:40,648 --> 00:15:42,108
ice cream, yogurt, and jelly!

342
00:15:42,108 --> 00:15:44,360
How about some porridge instead?

343
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,779
(screaming)

344
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:49,907
Should I just go ahead
and strangle him to death?

345
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,576
Sorry.

346
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:54,162
I said I'm sorry.

347
00:15:54,162 --> 00:15:56,747
Don't worry about last night.

348
00:15:56,747 --> 00:16:00,835
I couldn't see anything
through all the steam.

349
00:16:00,835 --> 00:16:03,546
(grumbling)

350
00:16:03,546 --> 00:16:04,755
(screaming)

351
00:16:04,755 --> 00:16:07,758
Wait, I want soup!

352
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:10,178
(doorbell ringing)

353
00:16:10,178 --> 00:16:12,096
Hi, Sunako, how's it going?

354
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,598
Takenaga said Kyohei was sick,

355
00:16:13,598 --> 00:16:15,391
so I brought some
get well gifts!

356
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:19,103
I hope he likes them‐‐
strawberries, his favorite!

357
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:22,023
Would it be possible if you
could do this instead of me,

358
00:16:22,023 --> 00:16:23,774
‐Miss beautiful Noi?
‐No way!

359
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:25,776
‐Why?
‐But since I'm here,

360
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,321
how about a little girl talk?

361
00:16:28,321 --> 00:16:30,823
Okay, to sum up, you feel dizzy,

362
00:16:30,823 --> 00:16:32,074
can't stop getting nose bleeds,

363
00:16:32,074 --> 00:16:34,452
and think you're going to melt,
because Kyohei is so radiant,

364
00:16:34,452 --> 00:16:36,162
‐is that right?
‐Uh‐huh.

365
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:37,246
Not to change the subject,

366
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:39,290
but why are all the
flowers dead right there?

367
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:42,418
That has nothing to do
with this conversation.

368
00:16:42,418 --> 00:16:43,669
I can't do this anymore.

369
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,837
I can't be near him.

370
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,380
I don't wanna go
near him ever again!

371
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,506
Oh, I get it, so
what you're saying

372
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,133
is that you actually
like him, huh?

373
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:53,137
‐No, that's not it at all!
‐Oh, bummer, you're no fun!

374
00:16:53,137 --> 00:16:56,849
All of this that damned
creature of light's fault.

375
00:16:56,849 --> 00:16:59,143
That's right‐‐my life's
becoming a living hell,

376
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:01,479
and it's all because of
those radiant creatures!

377
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,688
You're so interesting!

378
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:05,191
I have no idea what you're
talking about right now!

379
00:17:05,191 --> 00:17:08,945
(indistinct screaming)

380
00:17:08,945 --> 00:17:11,113
Now, I'm admittedly
not an expert,

381
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:12,615
but it seems to me
that if the problem

382
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:14,575
is that they seem
so full of light,

383
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:16,535
maybe you should try
not being so gloomy

384
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:17,912
and perk up a little!

385
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:20,998
♪

386
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,333
Well, that's easy for you to say

387
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:24,710
since you're one of the
creatures of light as well.

388
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:26,254
I'm one of them, too?

389

‐How lucky!
‐Not when you consider it

390

of light point of view,

392
00:17:32,218 --> 00:17:33,553
To be honest it makes me wonder

393
00:17:33,553 --> 00:17:35,930
if you know your place as
a beautiful person at all.

394
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:38,683
Excuse me‐‐as someone who isn't
even trying to make an effort,

395
00:17:38,683 --> 00:17:40,017

Do you have any
idea how hard it was

398
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:44,897
to get Takenaga
to even notice me?

399
00:17:44,897 --> 00:17:47,984
I have to work at it harder
than any other girl in school!

400
00:17:47,984 --> 00:17:50,570
Work at it?

401
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,363
(screaming)

402
00:17:52,363 --> 00:17:56,075
The Road to Womanhood!

403
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,786
To perfect that flawless smile
befitting an elegant lady...

404
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,372
Put your lips together like
an octopus and say, "Oooh!"

405
00:18:01,372 --> 00:18:04,208
Follow that by opening your
sweet little mouth sideways...

406
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:05,626
And saying, "Eee!"

407
00:18:05,626 --> 00:18:07,378
Oooh, eee, oooh, eee, oooh, eee!

408
00:18:07,378 --> 00:18:08,671
Wrong!

409
00:18:08,671 --> 00:18:11,382
It's pointless unless you do
it very slowly and ladylike.

410
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:13,467
And, if it really starts
to hurt, take a break.

411
00:18:13,467 --> 00:18:16,887
Hey, Takenaga, what do
you think about my smile?

412
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,639
I can't take this anymore!

413
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,225
Oooh, eee!

414
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:24,395
(gong booming)

415
00:18:24,395 --> 00:18:27,481
It might sound strange,
but I actually envy you.

416
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:30,234
You're so lucky to get to
see Takenaga's beautiful face

417
00:18:30,234 --> 00:18:31,736
every single day!

418
00:18:31,736 --> 00:18:33,613
I've only seen him at
school where he puts on

419
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:35,197
that cool and serious front.

420
00:18:35,197 --> 00:18:37,241
So what's he like when
he's just hanging out?

421
00:18:37,241 --> 00:18:38,576
I have no idea.

422
00:18:38,576 --> 00:18:40,453
He's so radiant
that it blinds me.

423
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:42,997
‐Oh, I see.
‐Am I correct in assuming

424
00:18:42,997 --> 00:18:44,582
that you like Takenaga?

425
00:18:44,582 --> 00:18:47,585
Uh‐huh‐‐I love him!

426
00:18:47,585 --> 00:18:50,671
Take my word for it,
you can change Sunako.

427
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,923
All it takes is
making a little effort.

428
00:18:52,923 --> 00:18:56,636
Stop living in the darkness
and come into the light!

429
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:58,763
‐Good luck!
‐Right,

430
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:01,766
that's what a person who
was born pretty would say.

431
00:19:01,766 --> 00:19:03,017
What the hell?

432
00:19:03,017 --> 00:19:05,227
Is this a fried
soy sauce bottle top?

433
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:07,271
No kidding, my
whole plate's fried!

434
00:19:07,271 --> 00:19:09,106
Is it my fault for
not making the effort,

435
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,941
or is it the fault of
the creatures of light?

436
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:12,902
Actually, God's
responsible, but‐‐

437
00:19:12,902 --> 00:19:15,905
Not to interrupt your
rambling, but did Noi come by?

438
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:18,908
Yes, and thanks to her, I've
gained so much enlightenment.

439
00:19:18,908 --> 00:19:20,785
And all that just by
delivering strawberries!

440
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:23,120
‐That Noi's amazing.
‐What I think is amazing

441
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:25,539
is you Takenaga, and
the way you play Noi,

442
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:27,083
so when are you
gonna give her some?

443
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:30,127
She wants to date, so are
you out or in, out or in?

444
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:31,879
Shut up, Yuki, that's not nice!

445
00:19:31,879 --> 00:19:35,466
I guess it must be nice

446
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:38,511
to have been born
pretty like Noi was.

447
00:19:38,511 --> 00:19:40,554
Look, you've got
it wrong, Sunako.

448
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,139
Noi wasn't like
that from day one,

449
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,141
she had to work
to be that pretty!

450
00:19:44,141 --> 00:19:45,351
Just look!

451
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:47,895
This is a picture of Noi back
when she was in junior high!

452
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:49,647
‐No way!
‐And yet somehow

453
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,817
she's become as pretty as
she is without plastic surgery.

454
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,861
Yeah, pretty is as pretty
does‐‐you can do it!

455

So hang in there, and we'll

And you'll never let
someone call you ugly again!

457

Hello‐‐Sunako?

458
00:20:04,412 --> 00:20:06,956
But can someone
defy the will of God?

459
00:20:06,956 --> 00:20:08,457
Should you defy the will of God?

460

defy the will of God...
