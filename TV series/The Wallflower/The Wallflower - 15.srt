silver, pearls, anything.

Personally, I'll be
happy if I can find

91
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:32,689
some old dinosaur fossils.

92
00:04:32,689 --> 00:04:33,607
Fossils?

93
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:35,692
Dude, you sound
like an old geezer.

94
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:38,320
Uninhabited island
means marooned hotties.

Huh, I'd rather find
some unusual animals

Some rare, elusive critters.

98

Fine with me as long
as they're edible.

Hello there, folks,
I'm the captain.

That ship is actually
a floating hotel

especially for
you to stay in.

everything you'll need

Wow, Auntie's
so prepared.

You're not a
little suspicious?

114
00:05:11,603 --> 00:05:13,313
Why would
you say that?

115
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:14,856
All right then,
I'll let you guys

116
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,066
take care of the rest.

117
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,651
I'm the captain!

118
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,527
And he's gone.

119
00:05:18,527 --> 00:05:19,653
This is suspicious.

120
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:22,113
Why would he be telling us
to take care of the rest?

something to eat
for dinner tonight.

Sunako Nakahara,
you're coming with me.

Protecting your
skin from sun damage.

00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,470
Doing this will
keep you fair skinned

132

all year long.

133
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:47,389
Wrong!

134
00:05:47,389 --> 00:05:48,932
In fact, it's
much more effective

135
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,767
to apply a little
sunblock frequently

136
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:51,977
than a lot all at once.

137
00:05:51,977 --> 00:05:53,645
And getting plenty
vitamin C at the same time

138
00:05:53,645 --> 00:05:55,730
will prevent you
from getting freckles.

139
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:57,482
But if you forget
to apply sunblock,

140
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,568
all you'll
get is tragedy.

141
00:05:59,568 --> 00:06:02,028
Oh no, oh no!

142
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,699
Waaaaaa!

143
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,158
Oh, don't be
like that, Sunako.

144
00:06:07,158 --> 00:06:09,661
This is a vacation, you're
supposed to enjoy it.

145
00:06:09,661 --> 00:06:10,537
Aaah!

146
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,706
Okay, Sunako?

147
00:06:12,706 --> 00:06:13,582
Aaah!

148
00:06:13,582 --> 00:06:15,709
We don't get to
do this very often.

149
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,543
Aaah!

150
00:06:16,543 --> 00:06:18,336
Are you even listening
to us, Sunako?

151
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:21,423
Aaah, don't worry
about me, I'm fine!

152
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:22,507
(laughing)

153
00:06:22,507 --> 00:06:24,593
You'll probably say
you can't stand sunshine.

154
00:06:24,593 --> 00:06:26,928
But I'll bet that
you're scared of water.

155
00:06:26,928 --> 00:06:28,346
No, that's not true!

156
00:06:28,346 --> 00:06:29,806
Jeez, what
a crying shame.

157
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,349
I mean, just have
a look for yourself,

158
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,685
I can see so many fish
swimming around in the water

159
00:06:33,685 --> 00:06:37,188
and I even spotted some
fresh skeletons down there.

160
00:06:37,188 --> 00:06:37,856
Fresh?

161
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,399
Did you say fresh?

162
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,484
Fresh, fresh, fresh,
fresh, fresh, fresh

163
00:06:41,484 --> 00:06:43,653
skeletons!

164
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,530
I'm coming!

165
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:47,532
And I won't share
them with anyone!
