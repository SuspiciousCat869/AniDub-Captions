You're at a restaurant, and you

little difficult to do.

I can't believe it!

330

No, this is so indecent
I can't stand it!

331
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:49,388
It's just that having an actual
lady here in our home made me

332
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:51,516
feel as though I were
somehow betraying Noi.

333

sensitive all the time,

335

I'd rather have the old Sunako.

336

I agree.

337
00:14:57,647 --> 00:14:59,690
Kyohei, if you kiss her the
shock might cause her to go

338
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,733
back to her old self!

339
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,610
Why didn't you just say
so instead of beating

340
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,694
around the bush?

341
00:15:03,694 --> 00:15:05,571
Not that I want to do
it, because free rent is

342
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:06,906
more important than all that.

343
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:08,783
But you just told
her to change back!

344
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:11,202
Yeah, well, I changed
my mind, so there!

345

never say anything like that.

350
00:15:20,128 --> 00:15:21,379
Ah?

351
00:15:21,379 --> 00:15:23,881
In fact, the Sunako we know
is always stirring up trouble

352
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,925
and making things horrifying
regardless of what's

353
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,635
going on around her.

354
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:30,596
Not only that, our Sunako
randomly gushes blood

355
00:15:30,596 --> 00:15:32,974
from her nose and
causes us all to panic!

356

(screaming)

358
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,730
Normally, she would get
a nosebleed if she got

359
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,065
that close to us.

360
00:15:41,065 --> 00:15:42,358
Hold on, nosebleeds?

361
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:44,485
Maybe we should
fight sex with sex.

362
