small changes gradually.

185

Like when you're
waiting at the bus stop.

Tighten your buttocks

using your waist.

and a complete human
anatomy encyclopedia.

506
00:21:16,734 --> 00:21:18,402
Plus some cash, but I never
thought it would bring

507
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:20,905
this much excitement
to the Sports Festival.

508
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:22,448
As a student
council member‐‐

509
00:21:22,448 --> 00:21:25,367
Council members,
huh, that's a lie!

510
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:26,702
‐Sir?
‐Sir?

511
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:29,580
Just five meters left,
who's gonna win this?

512
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,581
That's my microphone.

513
00:21:30,581 --> 00:21:32,792
Yo, deal's off!

514
00:21:32,792 --> 00:21:35,586
‐Aaah!
‐Aaah!

515
00:21:35,586 --> 00:21:38,589
(cracking)

516
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:41,675
(crying)

517
00:21:41,675 --> 00:21:43,886
(crashing)

518
00:21:43,886 --> 00:21:45,471
They're down!

519
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,764
Neither can get up!

520
00:21:46,764 --> 00:21:47,890
They can't do it!

521
00:21:47,890 --> 00:21:49,934
Have they run
out of steam?

522
00:21:49,934 --> 00:21:51,602
Oh, boy.

523
00:21:51,602 --> 00:21:52,686
I'm so moved.

524
00:21:52,686 --> 00:21:55,356
I don't even care who
wins or loses the race now.

525
00:21:55,356 --> 00:21:56,816
Excellent job, you two.

526
00:21:56,816 --> 00:21:58,275
That was awesome.

527
00:21:58,275 --> 00:22:00,611
(applause)

528
00:22:00,611 --> 00:22:01,821
Thank you, Takano.

529
00:22:01,821 --> 00:22:03,364
Thank you, Nakahara.

530
00:22:03,364 --> 00:22:05,991
We'll never forget
this emotional moment.

531
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:09,620
Thank you for allowing
us to share your dream.

532
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,956
A new dream.

533
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:13,707
Forever!

534
00:22:13,707 --> 00:23:39,209
♪

535
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,841
Time for the next
episode preview, milady.

536
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:47,885
In the next episode,
Sunako, Noi, and I will‐‐

537
00:23:47,885 --> 00:23:48,594
There's a lot of these!

538
00:23:48,594 --> 00:23:49,887
Don't be so imperious.

539
00:23:49,887 --> 00:23:51,972
No not that, but all
three of us will be naked

540
00:23:51,972 --> 00:23:53,057
and get massages.

541
00:23:53,057 --> 00:23:54,350
Oh, no, you
can't touch that.

542
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:55,809
I didn't know it
was that kind of story.

543
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:57,311
Like that's possible.

544
00:23:57,311 --> 00:23:58,395
Next time on
The Wallflower,

545
00:23:58,395 --> 00:23:59,730
Girls, Bravo!

546
00:23:59,730 --> 00:24:01,065
But it is
kinda like that.

547
00:24:01,065 --> 00:24:03,275
Oh no, flesh!
