Hello, Hiroshi here.

00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:11,512
I'm not sure why,
but lately, I get the feeling

5
00:00:11,512 --> 00:00:13,055
that college girls
understand me

00:00:13,055 --> 00:00:15,015
much better than
housewives do.

00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:18,227
Anyway, here's what
happened in the last episode.

00:00:18,227 --> 00:00:19,811
Oh, what's going on here?

9
00:00:19,811 --> 00:00:22,231
I don't know, I saw
Ranmaru running away,

10
00:00:22,231 --> 00:00:23,482
then I heard someone scream!

11
00:00:23,482 --> 00:00:25,943
The manager is dead!

12
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:28,737
The manager, th‐‐that's
Sayuri's husband, right?

Wait, are you saying

What are you laughing about?

16
00:00:35,285 --> 00:00:37,955
That's not polite, Sunako.

17
00:00:37,955 --> 00:00:39,164
Neither are you!

18
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,249
Oh well.

Nothing to see here.

Was he stabbed to

Or maybe he was beaten.

Oh, wait, he could

Oh, maybe his head was

Excuse me, I'd like to ask you

‐Sure.
‐A real detective.

I need to know
where each of you was

when the incident took place.

A real investigation!

44
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,851
Yes, sir, the three of us
were in the karaoke room

45
00:03:04,851 --> 00:03:06,269
on the first floor.

46
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:08,563
‐Mmhmm.
‐I see.

47
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,815
A real alibi!

How about you?

49
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,110
I was in the back room
with that thing.

That thing?

00:03:14,403 --> 00:03:15,987
‐Hm?
‐It's real!

52
00:03:15,987 --> 00:03:17,614
I see.

00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,699
That thing, huh?

54
00:03:18,699 --> 00:03:20,117
Detective!

55
00:03:20,117 --> 00:03:21,284
Oh, I saw him!

56
00:03:21,284 --> 00:03:23,203
I saw the culprit,
the murderer!

57
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,496
A real witness,
a real witness!

58
00:03:24,496 --> 00:03:26,540
Calm down, try to
compose yourself.

59
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,583
He had such a beautiful face,

60
00:03:28,583 --> 00:03:31,461
and he was tall,
sexy, with silky hair.

61
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,963
Uh, ma'am,
we're not interested

62
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,965
in hearing what your
ideal man would be like.

63
00:03:34,965 --> 00:03:36,383
That's not what
I'm talking about!

64
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,801
I told you I saw him!

65
00:03:37,801 --> 00:03:38,510
She saw it!

66
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,511
A real serving lady saw it!

67
00:03:39,511 --> 00:03:41,680
Hey, do you guys
think it's possible

68
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:43,181
she's talking about Ranmaru?

69
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,725
Now that you mention it,
where the hell is he anyway?

70
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:48,019
I don't know, but maybe
we better go look for him.

71
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:49,146
...patient stabilized!

72
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,564
We're taking him
to the hospital!

73

‐Clear the way!
‐Hang in there, honey.

74
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:54,359
Please hang on.

75
00:03:54,359 --> 00:03:56,653
Oh, I can't believe they
were able to save him.

76
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:57,696
Hey!

77
00:03:57,696 --> 00:03:59,573
(siren wailing)

78
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,492
Thank goodness, I'm so glad
the boss is still alive.

79
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:04,703
Me too, but I can't
believe you were screaming

80
00:04:04,703 --> 00:04:05,829
like he was actually dead.

81
00:04:05,829 --> 00:04:07,581
My bad.

82
00:04:07,581 --> 00:04:11,626
Oh, my beautiful dead
body isn't really dead!

83
00:04:11,626 --> 00:04:13,712
Well, too bad for you.

84
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,338
You guys are so rude.

85
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:16,965
(crying)

86
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:19,009
So what did you observe
at the crime scene?

87
00:04:19,009 --> 00:04:21,136
His blood was splattered
all over in there.

88
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:23,013
And have you found
the weapon yet?

89
00:04:23,013 --> 00:04:25,182
Yeah, a real weapon!

90
00:04:25,182 --> 00:04:26,767
Don't you know when to stop?

91
00:04:26,767 --> 00:04:28,226
So the blood on
the weapon was...

92
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,395
Well, the blood would have
been the victim's, of course.

93
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:31,980
And how much blood
loss was there?

94
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,232
A six‐tatami room was
covered with blood.

95
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:36,485
I see, and what
type of weapon?

96
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,904
Like I said before,
a broad‐bladed kitchen knife.

97
00:04:38,904 --> 00:04:40,822

98
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:43,074
Huh?

99
00:04:43,074 --> 00:04:44,451
Stop interfering!

100
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:46,453
The weapon was,
the weapon was‐‐

101
00:04:46,453 --> 00:04:50,123
it was a broad‐bladed
kitchen knife!

103
00:04:57,047 --> 00:05:00,217
As a lady, I'd use my
broad‐bladed kitchen knife

104
00:05:00,217 --> 00:05:01,134
to cut the throats‐‐

For once in my life

I want to see a murder
scene covered in blood!

I'll see it with
my own two eyes.

Yoo‐hoo, wait for me, guys!

You can't come in here.

113

Authorized personnel only.

00:05:20,153 --> 00:05:21,780
I think I'll go try
the other side.

00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:23,907
Sorry, miss, you'll
have to stay back.

117

118
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:26,827
I can't accept this,
I am unhappy.

This is‐‐ooh, sorry.

Oh, blood!

How lovely!

This is so
incredibly wonderful!

Damn, you realize that

I can't let you live.

Don't take it personally.

Oh, that guy just
fell out of the sky!

I'm sorry, I didn't
mean to do that.

Ah, a ghost!

No, no, she's with us.

135
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,612
She's human, I think.

136
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:05,073
Um, sorry, sorry,
I'm the one who did that.

137
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,826
I didn't mean to throw him,
but I did, and I'm sorry.

138
00:06:07,826 --> 00:06:09,202
I'm truly sorry, mister,

139
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,371
and I apologize to you
from the bottom of my heart,

140
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:14,082
so will you please just do
me this one little favor?

141

Now what's she babbling about?

Please listen to me!

143
00:06:18,211 --> 00:06:19,671
Would you mind
letting me have

144
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,090
these bloody
clothes of yours?

145

(screaming)

146
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,011
I'm a chef.

147
00:06:26,011 --> 00:06:28,805
I got blood on me when I
was cutting up some tuna!

148
00:06:28,805 --> 00:06:30,807
‐You gotta believe me!
‐Shut your rice hole.

149
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,183
You're going downtown.

150

My bloody clothes.

151
00:06:33,768 --> 00:06:35,437
This isn't funny.

153

My lovely, bloody,
wretchedly stained clothes.

154
00:06:40,025 --> 00:06:42,193
You did a good job,
you know that?

155
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:43,945
You're so cool, Sunako.

156
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:46,531
So it was her.

157
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,116
Hm.

This must be difficult.

162
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:00,337
Are you all right?

163
00:07:00,337 --> 00:07:02,672
That detective asked me
lots of questions.

164
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:03,590
Really?

165
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,717
I was wondering about
last night, about what‐‐

166

It's so awful that you
had to deal with this.

169
00:07:10,764 --> 00:07:12,891
It really is so unfortunate.

170
00:07:12,891 --> 00:07:14,225

Oh, that's a relief
for right now, huh?

174
00:07:23,068 --> 00:07:25,820
Yeah, the owner ended up
surviving the attack

175
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:27,405
and the police caught
the guy who did it,

176
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:28,907
so that's case closed, right?

177
00:07:28,907 --> 00:07:31,993
As illogical as it seems,
that's basically correct.

178
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,912
I have to admit
that after I saw

179
00:07:33,912 --> 00:07:35,246
Ranmaru running last night,

180
00:07:35,246 --> 00:07:37,832
I was starting to wonder
about what was going on here.

181
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:39,250
Yes, about that.

182
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,086
Ah, holy crap!

Watch how you're sitting!

184
00:07:42,587 --> 00:07:43,880
Yeah, there are
plenty of reasons

185
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,799
we should be banned from
broadcast TV already.

186
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,133
...the most awful thing.

187
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,843
I'm gonna be sick.

188
00:07:48,843 --> 00:07:50,053
Now that's just rude.

189
00:07:50,053 --> 00:07:52,305
So, anyway, what were
you just saying?

190
00:07:52,305 --> 00:07:54,140
Oh, I almost forgot.

191
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:55,141
Remember how I told you

192
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:58,103
Sayuri asked me to
meet her last night?

193
00:07:58,103 --> 00:08:00,230
I'll be getting off shortly,

194
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:03,149
so wait for me
in the back room.

195
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,943

196
00:08:04,943 --> 00:08:07,445
Oh, Sayuri.

(sighing)

198
00:08:10,407 --> 00:08:13,076
So, naturally, I was
busy making preparations

199
00:08:13,076 --> 00:08:14,285
so I could go to work

200
00:08:14,285 --> 00:08:16,079
when she was finished
for the evening.

201
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,331
‐Preparations?
‐Well, of course, silly.

202
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:21,126
I had to go into town to
get some roses and wine

203
00:08:21,126 --> 00:08:22,335
to set the mood.

204
00:08:22,335 --> 00:08:23,795
I really look up to you

205
00:08:23,795 --> 00:08:25,213
when it comes to
that kind of stuff.

206
00:08:25,213 --> 00:08:27,966
Of course, anyway, I took
the tools of my trade

207
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:29,968
and went over to her room
when it was almost time

208
00:08:29,968 --> 00:08:32,971
for her to get off
work, however...

209
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:33,888
Ah!

210
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,306
Yeah, the whole
dead body thing.

211
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,391
He's not dead.

212
00:08:36,391 --> 00:08:37,392
Oh, yeah!

213
00:08:37,392 --> 00:08:39,144
Well, to make a
long story short,

214
00:08:39,144 --> 00:08:42,230
I got a little freaked out
and took off running.

I have to tell you,
after living with Sunako,

216
00:08:46,192 --> 00:08:48,111
I thought I'd gotten
used to the scary stuff,

217

but the real
thing is no joke.

218

Hold on, she asked
you to meet her?

was a broad‐bladed
kitchen knife?
