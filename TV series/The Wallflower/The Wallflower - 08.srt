First you must know

When partaking
in French cuisine,

211
00:11:23,725 --> 00:11:25,935
draw the spoon towards
you as you eat.

212
00:11:25,935 --> 00:11:28,771
However, with any other type of
cuisine, one should always draw

the spoon away from
oneself as one eats.

one's soup, nor should one

take several sips
from the same spoonful.

218

gently with the spoon.
