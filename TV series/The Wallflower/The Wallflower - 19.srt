00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:11,502
That stuff doesn't matter
once it's in your stomach.

513
00:20:11,502 --> 00:20:13,629
(gong ringing)

514
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:15,923
(groans)

515
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:18,843
How come I smell chocolate?

516
00:20:18,843 --> 00:20:20,970
I hope it's not some
crazy girl who snuck

517
00:20:20,970 --> 00:20:22,138
into the house.

518
00:20:22,138 --> 00:20:23,264
No way.

519
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,181
It can't...

520
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,391
(screams)

521
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:27,643
(Sunako hums joyfully)

522
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:34,024
♪

523
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:36,944
(groans)

524
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,822
Now, let's all
eat this together.

525
00:20:39,822 --> 00:20:41,365
(together)
What?

526
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:42,366
Ahh!

527
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,078
(groaning)

528
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,497
It's awesome!

529
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:53,878
(screams)

530
00:20:53,878 --> 00:20:55,796
Hey, that's mine!

531
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,173
It's mine!

532
00:20:57,173 --> 00:20:58,257
Ah.

533
00:20:58,257 --> 00:21:00,718
Sweet stuff really is
the best when you're tired.

534
00:21:00,718 --> 00:21:03,220
Yeah, but will you
hurry up and make dinner?

535
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,347
But that Valentine's
chocolate was supposed

536
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:06,724
to be for me.

537
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:07,725
Oh.

538
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:10,978
Well, in any case,
at least we did manage

539
00:21:10,978 --> 00:21:13,230
to make it back home safely.

540
00:21:13,230 --> 00:21:14,732
Cheers!

541
00:21:14,732 --> 00:21:16,108
Oh, boy.

542
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,611
I didn't know what was gonna
happen for a while there.

543
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:19,987
Too right.

544
00:21:19,987 --> 00:21:22,823
I mean, if Noi hadn't shown up,
it really would've been bad.

545
00:21:22,823 --> 00:21:24,450
Oh, no, I forgot!

546
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,868
Noi's chocolate!

547
00:21:25,868 --> 00:21:27,995
Ah, where's the phone!

548
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:29,163
Where's the phone!

549
00:21:29,163 --> 00:21:30,414
You jerk.

550
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,166
So, are you the pot
or the kettle?

551
00:21:32,166 --> 00:21:33,250
Exactly.

552
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,252
You made that rich
girl cry today.

553
00:21:35,252 --> 00:21:37,171
(laughs)

554
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:39,757
That stuff happens
to me all the time.

555
00:21:39,757 --> 00:21:41,217
I don't care.

556
00:21:41,217 --> 00:21:43,928
No, couldn't care less.

557
00:21:43,928 --> 00:21:45,471
I'll be in the John.

558
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,597
Aww.

559
00:21:46,597 --> 00:21:48,098
So, in the end,
the only Valentine

560
00:21:48,098 --> 00:21:50,392
chocolate that any of us
actually ate this year

561
00:21:50,392 --> 00:21:52,019
was made by Sunako.

562
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,938
Well, so what?

563
00:21:53,938 --> 00:21:56,065
‐Tasted good.
‐Yup.

564
00:21:57,775 --> 00:21:59,485
Yummy!

565
00:21:59,485 --> 00:22:01,028
Noi, I'm sorry about that.

566
00:22:01,028 --> 00:22:01,946
No, no, no.

567
00:22:01,946 --> 00:22:03,322
It's not that
I forgot about it,

568
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:04,949
certainly not,
I could never forget‐‐

569
00:22:04,949 --> 00:22:06,951
What happened today wasn't
what you were thinking.

570
00:22:06,951 --> 00:22:08,244
I swear‐‐what?

571
00:22:08,244 --> 00:22:09,453
No, don't call
your driver.

572
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,372
Hey, let me
talk to him now!

573
00:22:11,372 --> 00:22:12,498
No, I mean...

574
00:22:12,498 --> 00:22:14,041
forget about him!

575
00:22:14,041 --> 00:22:16,669
(both)
No, Valentine's Day!

576
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,254
Come back!

577
00:22:18,254 --> 00:22:20,214
(dial tone)

578
00:23:44,465 --> 00:23:46,717
I despise you,
I curse you!

579
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,760
What happened?

580
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,094
She said someone
kidnapped Hiroshi.

581
00:23:49,094 --> 00:23:50,054
Again?

582
00:23:50,054 --> 00:23:51,305
Whoever did it,
please surrender at once.

583
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:52,473
Sunako has a little mercy.

584
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:53,766
I'll do this and this

585
00:23:53,766 --> 00:23:55,059
to whoever took it!

586
00:23:55,059 --> 00:23:56,060
(groans)

587
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,436
Whoever did it,
he better run now.

588
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:58,562
Next time on The Wallflower:

589
00:23:58,562 --> 00:23:59,605
"Trial of Love."

590
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:00,689
Was it you?

591
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:01,732
It wasn't me!
