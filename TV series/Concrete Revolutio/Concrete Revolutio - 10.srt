[HYOUMA C] During my tenure
at the History Police,

229
00:12:15,125 --> 00:12:17,291
I felt I could
better the future.

230
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,250
By going back
and changing history.

231
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:22,041
As a result, I escaped the

You're the leader of the IQ?

Where I'm from, there
are no superhumans left.

234
00:12:26,916 --> 00:12:28,750
The potential to become
superhuman was taken

235
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:30,583
from us entirely.

236
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:34,208
My choice was clear.
I had to repair history.

237
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:37,416
But as I made changes,
another copy of myself,

238
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:40,208
who was still in the
Time Patrol, found me.

I couldn't kill him, or else
I'd disappear as well.

241

further back in time.

as a member of the IQ--

truly be erased.

we live with forever.

255
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,000
is the Superhuman Bureau evil?

We take freedom
from superhumans.

to destroy the Bureau,

[ULLR]
The past version of himself.

268

The one that hasn't created
the Superhuman Bureau. Yet.

269
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:51,625
Wait. I'm confused
about what would happen

270
00:13:51,708 --> 00:13:53,791
to this current Mr. Jaguar.

271
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,666
What if someone
goes back to prehistory

272
00:13:55,750 --> 00:13:57,458
and kills all the monkeys
that would eventually

273
00:13:57,541 --> 00:13:59,291
evolve into humans?

274
00:13:59,375 --> 00:14:01,083
You'd think that would
cause the eradication

275
00:14:01,166 --> 00:14:03,541
of all humankind, right?

276
00:14:03,625 --> 00:14:05,541
But the future person
evolved from the monkey

277
00:14:05,625 --> 00:14:06,750
as well.

278
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,833
Which created humanity
in the first place.

279
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:09,916
So, um...

280
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,833
The answer is no.

281
00:14:11,916 --> 00:14:13,958
When forced with
an unsolvable paradox,

282
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,666
time just leaves it alone.

283

But me, I'm not important
enough to trigger that safety.

Does that mean you're
going to disappear?

285
00:14:21,833 --> 00:14:24,250
Since I first created
the Superhuman Bureau,

286

would eventually arrive.

You are part of IQ.

A true weapon doesn't
need limbs or a head.

It's a waste of fuel,

him it was from the future.

Also, he said it
might take a while,

how time travel works.

402

[HYOUMA C] So, my own watch
begins time travel research.
