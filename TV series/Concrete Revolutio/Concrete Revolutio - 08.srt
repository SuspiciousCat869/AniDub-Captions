I didn't want you to see this.

I know deep down you don't
really wanna fight us.

Don't worry about that.

Just stand back and
let us handle this.

[RAITO] I can't. They're
illegally occupying the campus.

I know, we're here to negotiate

[DETECTIVE 8A]
The times sure have changed.

A few years back, things
were going the other way.

21
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,125
The protestors wanted harsher
control of superhumans.

Really? I didn't know that.

It was around the time
of the Daitetsu thing.

They're superhumans, right?

Yes, but despite our attempts,
they've refused registration.

For the record,
we don't take normal cases.

finding missing people

He was an evil superhuman
who nearly destroyed Japan.

His origin is a mystery,
and his true identity

has never been discovered.

[AKITA]
Hold on. Where are you off to?

99

Calm down. They asked the
BL Club kids for protection,

00:06:09,125 --> 00:06:10,750
so they're covered.

[EMI]
Have you reached a conclusion?

106
00:06:12,583 --> 00:06:14,791
No. I keep trying,
but it's weird.

107
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,833
I just can't figure out
how something that size

108
00:06:16,916 --> 00:06:18,916
can move the way it does
without some sort of engine

109
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:20,375
or other energy source.

110
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:22,041
[EMI]
Would it be possible with magic?

111
00:06:22,125 --> 00:06:23,333
Well, I asked around,

112
00:06:23,416 --> 00:06:25,541
but there aren't
any mages like that.

113
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,125
What do you mean? Asked who?

114
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,666
Oh!

115
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,833
Jiro's Equus is a big robot.
Couldn't it function like that?

116
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,791
[KIKKO] Considering that one
was built by Mr. Jaguar,

117
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:35,250
it's not likely.

118
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:38,083
But the real mystery
is this Yumihiko kid.

119
00:06:38,166 --> 00:06:41,208
Seems suspicious I can't
find anything on his past.

120
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,166
That's tough.

121
00:06:42,250 --> 00:06:44,583
Did Jiro put you onto this?

122
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:45,958
Not really.

123
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:48,125
He seems overwhelmed,
and I thought I could help.

124
00:06:48,208 --> 00:06:49,500
He gets like that.

125
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:52,916
The Rainbow Knight was
a big influence on him.

126
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,958
[KIKKO] Why's he so attached to
one of the older superhumans?

127
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:12,333
I'm gonna do another sweep.

[RAITO]
Birdwatching?

129
00:07:17,875 --> 00:07:19,958
Or are you hoping to get the
Rainbow Knight's autograph?

130
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:25,875
I'm no worse than a cop
who has to sneak around.

131
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,500
Yeah, so I got kicked out.

132
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:28,875
That collector's a nut.

133
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,375
He doesn't trust the
police because of some

134
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:32,000
conspiracy theory.

135
00:07:32,083 --> 00:07:34,083
About the government
killing Rainbow Knight.

136
00:07:34,166 --> 00:07:35,708
[KIKKO gasps]
Killing him?

137
00:07:37,708 --> 00:07:38,666
[FUUROUTA]
Heh...

138
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,083
What are you two doing here?

139
00:07:40,166 --> 00:07:41,583
We thought you might
do something stupid

140
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:43,125
if we didn't keep an eye on you.

141
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,208
Anyway...

142
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:45,541
I did some digging
on Rainbow Knight,

143
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,958
but couldn't find anything
on his secret identity.

144
00:07:48,041 --> 00:07:50,291
But what I did find is
he was a big influence

145
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,541
in post-war.

146
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:53,708
And as a result,
a lot of kids became his fans.

147
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:55,875
But the truth came out
about him five years ago,

148
00:07:55,958 --> 00:07:57,208
when he died.

149
00:07:57,291 --> 00:07:59,500
He brought it on himself
when he made that ransom.

150
00:07:59,583 --> 00:08:00,958
It's not like
anyone's gonna forget

151
00:08:01,041 --> 00:08:02,791
when you kidnap somebody.

152
00:08:02,875 --> 00:08:05,083
In the end, he was
just another criminal.

153
00:08:05,166 --> 00:08:06,500
Prior to that,
the secrecy law

154
00:08:06,583 --> 00:08:07,958
had almost been forgotten,

155
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:10,875
and superhumans maintained
relatively public presences.

156
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,291
But that event prompted
the government

157
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:13,583
to start cracking down.

158
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:16,708
Which is why the conspiracy
must have emerged.

159
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:19,041
I was right there when he died.

160
00:08:19,125 --> 00:08:20,750
Maybe he was a criminal.

161
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,708
But he still defended justice.

162
00:08:22,791 --> 00:08:24,291
I know this is tough for you.

163
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,333
Especially because he
saved you from that beast

164

a long time ago.

165
00:08:27,791 --> 00:08:29,166

working for the Eye of Lucifer.

It's really him!

What are you looking for?

177
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,166
I kind of thought
if he was here,

178
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:57,041
maybe the Rainbow Knight
would show up as well.

179
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,833
[FUUROUTA] Sounds like
Jiro's not the only fan-boy

180
00:08:58,916 --> 00:09:00,583
with some personal
interest in this case.

181
00:09:00,666 --> 00:09:02,541
Back off!
I grew out of that phase!

you're going, old man?

gonna catch the bad guy

Doesn't look like
you did any better.

But at least we're not trying
to emulate a criminal.

C'mon, let's get
out of here, Kikko.

With your power,
it should be really easy!

You can find the

Even with the monsters,
there's no guarantee.

[JIRO]
I don't care.

We have to prove
Rainbow Knight is innocent!

Fine, as long as you uphold
your end of the bargain.

What happened?

[EMI] She was on her way to
the kitchen when she found this.

Wait a minute. The what?

208
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,416
[RAITO]
So, what brings you here today?

209
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,833
I thought that your
group handled things

210
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:11,708
more discretely.

211
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:13,000
[DOOR KNOB laughs]

212
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,375
That's cute.

213
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,708
Yeah.

214
00:11:15,791 --> 00:11:17,125
Well, I have some questions
that need answering.

215
00:11:17,208 --> 00:11:18,375
Ask away, then.

216
00:11:18,458 --> 00:11:19,625
Thanks, I will.

217
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:21,000
I wanna know about the
boy that was kidnapped

218
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:22,833
five years ago, Daitetsu Maki.

219
00:11:22,916 --> 00:11:25,041
I should've known it had
something to do with that.

220
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,666
When the police surrounded
the Rainbow Knight,

221
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:28,333
he suddenly lost
control of his powers

222
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:29,833
and exploded on the spot.

223
00:11:29,916 --> 00:11:31,625
After that, there's
no record of what happened

224
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,500
to the boy he abducted.

225
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:35,291
It's my understanding
that the authorities

226
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,625
gave the kid a new identity
in order to protect him

227
00:11:37,708 --> 00:11:39,833
from being mobbed by the media.

228
00:11:39,916 --> 00:11:41,375
But you don't know for sure.

229
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,750
What's your point?

230
00:11:42,833 --> 00:11:44,625
[KIKKO] There's a rumor that
Daitetsu never existed,

231
00:11:44,708 --> 00:11:46,208
and the whole thing
was set up by the cops

232
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,583
in order to make the Rainbow
Knight look like a criminal.

233
00:11:50,375 --> 00:11:52,708
Why in the world would they
do something like that?

234
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:55,083
I don't know. They could?

235
00:11:55,166 --> 00:11:56,500
It's just, when I think
about the people

236
00:11:56,583 --> 00:11:59,416
who still believe
he's innocent--

237
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:01,166
I want to give
them peace of mind.

You mean "him." Fine.

I don't remember inviting you,
so why are you here?

244
00:12:13,583 --> 00:12:15,541
Because the Eye of Lucifer
sent you a challenge,

245

--isn't that right?
--[HIDEAKI] Yeah, well.

246
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,250
We thought you could use
our help protecting the mask.

247
00:12:19,333 --> 00:12:20,916
I can defend my house on my own!

Let me show you to the door.

Sorry, but no.
We're staying right here.

250
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,125
After all, we were
hired to stop that creep.

I understand.

But still.

253
00:12:32,083 --> 00:12:33,333
The Rainbow Knight's
mask is more than safe.

254
00:12:33,416 --> 00:12:35,833
We have it locked up
underground in the vault.

255
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:38,291
There isn't anyone who'd
be able to get to it.

256
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,833
Can't believe you've
had it in your possession

257
00:12:39,916 --> 00:12:41,208
this whole time.

258
00:12:41,291 --> 00:12:42,625
Well, the Rainbow
Knight's powers

259
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,583
were one of the
targets of my study.

260
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,833
[JIRO] But how did the Eye
of Lucifer know it was here?

261
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,208
Not even I knew.

262
00:12:51,291 --> 00:12:52,916
It must have been
in the police records.

263
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:54,208
Someone let it slip.

264
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:58,541
[JIRO] Detective Shiba
told you this?

265
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:01,125
Yeah. There's no denying
Daitetsu existed.

266
00:13:01,208 --> 00:13:04,291
But now I'm more confused
than I was before.

267
00:13:04,375 --> 00:13:05,708
I hate to say it,

268
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:07,416
but I think we need to accept
that the Rainbow Knight

269
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,125
really was just a kidnapper.

270
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,291
It's all starting to make sense.

271

Remember what
Detective Shiba said?

272
00:13:13,583 --> 00:13:14,750
[RAITO] I kind of thought,
if he was here,

273
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:16,750
maybe the Rainbow Knight
would show up as well.

What's going on?

280
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,125
I bet it was the Eye of Lucifer!

281
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:32,791
He probably tried to steal
Equus to break into the vault.

282
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:34,041
[EMI]
That's impossible.

283
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,791
Jiro's the only person
who can activate Equus.

No point in leaving it out.

Right.

be a supervillain

if he stuck to a schedule.

293
00:13:47,791 --> 00:13:49,541
The mask he's holding is a fake.

294
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:51,166
He wants us to panic
and rush down

295

to open the vault so he
can steal the real thing

once we do.

No obvious signs
of forced entry.

What're your thoughts?

Emi and I are the only
ones who know the code.

Then it must be one of you two
who's responsible for this.

He managed to get away
with that balloon stunt again.

feeling about this.

To think he's come back...

"no one getting it."

registered with the bureau.

00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:05,833
[SANAE] Hi, my name
is Sanae Hatakeyama.

479
00:24:05,916 --> 00:24:08,666
We're what you'd call a very
ordinary Japanese family.

480
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:10,000
It just so happens
that we've been alive

481
00:24:10,083 --> 00:24:11,833
for a little longer than others.

482
00:24:11,916 --> 00:24:13,500
Actually, the
famous Masaki Tsuji

483
00:24:13,583 --> 00:24:15,708
even wrote a story
about us once!

484
00:24:15,791 --> 00:24:17,708
Please don't miss us
on the next episode!
