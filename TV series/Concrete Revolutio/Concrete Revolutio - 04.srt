320
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:45,875
There was a report
that there were a number

321
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:48,000
of <i>kaiju</i> sympathizers
residing here.

322

Go take a look for yourself.

323
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,583
But this hardly seems the place
for a breeding operation.

324
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:55,916
These people are harmless--
just a bunch of <i>kaiju</i> groupies.

325
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,750
Heh. How convenient for
your Bureau there's so many

326
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,250

in public these days.

Are you sure you're
really a detective?

[RAITO]
Yeah. I am.

One who specializes
in superhuman crimes.

332
00:16:19,208 --> 00:16:20,875
Someone's making
these <i>kaiju</i> appear

333
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:23,291
so superhumans look like
heroes by killing them.

334

At least that's what
the rumors say.

You don't really believe that.

The <i>kaiju</i> kept on coming.

353
00:17:03,708 --> 00:17:06,458
But, so did the superhumans.

354
00:17:06,541 --> 00:17:08,125
Around that same time,

355
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,458
shocking news reached
us from overseas.

356

[AKITA]
President Uchihata.

357
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:21,375
And I see Shimazu is here too.

358
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,333
[UCHIHATA] It's been a long
while since the three of us

359
00:17:23,416 --> 00:17:25,166
had to meet like this.

360
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,625
[AKITA] This is in regard
to Master Ultima returning,

361
00:17:27,708 --> 00:17:28,666
isn't it?

362
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:29,833
[UCHIHATA]
Yes.

363
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:32,125
And everything's about
to get real messy.

364
00:17:32,208 --> 00:17:34,791
We're going to be here all
day talking at this rate.

365
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:37,083
I suggest we be more
open with each other.

366
00:17:47,166 --> 00:17:48,666
[AKITA]
Their military's using <i>kaiju</i> ?

367
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:50,291
[SHIMAZU]
They've captured one from space.

[UCHIHATA] The White House's
trump card against the Soviets.

[AKITA] They call it
a weapon for justice.

370
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:55,916
[SHIMAZU] Our government
would never allow <i>kaiju</i>

371
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,500
to be used for
international war.

372
00:17:57,583 --> 00:17:59,875
[UCHIHATA] We must put a stop
to the "heroic superhumans

battling evil <i>kaiju</i> " act.

374
00:18:01,541 --> 00:18:03,208
[UCHIHATA] We don't want
the U.S. Army coming here.

375
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,916
[SHIMAZU] The police are
currently investigating

376
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,458
the <i>kaiju</i> trade.

377
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:09,291
I can't do anything to stop
them, unless you fully cut ties.

378
00:18:11,791 --> 00:18:14,333
It would have been a great
idea if it had worked.

379
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,541
When the public found
out about superhumans,

380
00:18:16,625 --> 00:18:19,916
we needed a clear-cut enemy
for them to unite against.

381
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,833
Institutions are only
seen as evil by some.

382
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:23,916
But <i>kaiju</i> ?

383
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,083
They're seen as
villainous by everyone.

384
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:28,208
What strikes me as odd
is the growing number

385
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,208
of people that are
developing an affinity

386
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:32,666
for these <i>kaiju</i> instead
of fearing them.

387
00:18:32,750 --> 00:18:35,791
It's a passing fad.
You know kids today.

388
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:39,750
[AKITA] Based on our
most recent findings,

389
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,416
it appears thirteen of the <i>kaiju</i>

390
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,166
that have attacked
since last autumn

391
00:18:43,250 --> 00:18:45,375
have been sold to separate
criminal organizations

392
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,083
by the exact same breeder.

393
00:18:47,166 --> 00:18:48,166
The same breeder?

394
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:50,208
Then Detective Shiba's
guess was right.

395
00:18:50,291 --> 00:18:52,208
They've been supplying
enemies for the superhumans

396
00:18:52,291 --> 00:18:54,166
to fight. Pretty clever.

397
00:18:54,250 --> 00:18:55,916
We're going to
destroy any evidence

398
