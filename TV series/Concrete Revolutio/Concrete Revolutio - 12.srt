1
00:00:08,583 --> 00:00:10,791
[MALE STUDENT A] Attention!
My Fellow Hakko students!

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:12,750
I call you to action!

3
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,750
We won't stand for
these injustices!

4
00:00:14,833 --> 00:00:17,291
[KIKKO] Now they're
protesting at high schools?

5
00:00:17,375 --> 00:00:18,958
It's getting serious.

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:21,583
[NAGAKAWA] They won't barricade
the campus or anything.

7
00:00:21,666 --> 00:00:25,416
But the students don't hesitate
to reveal they're superhumans.

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,833
[NAGAKAWA] Here you go.
Just like you asked for.

9
00:00:28,916 --> 00:00:30,458
You're a lifesaver, doctor.

10
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,875
Being from another
world can't be easy.

11
00:00:32,958 --> 00:00:35,875
Our medicine is useless if you
get injured or catch a cold.

12
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:37,750
[ULLR] You should stay away
from late night radio shows.

13
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,708
[KIKKO gasps]
Hey! Stay hidden!

14
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:42,666
[NAGAKAWA] Oh. Don't worry,
your mother already told me.

15
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:43,750
That must be Ullr.

16
00:00:43,833 --> 00:00:47,166
[KIKKO] Uh... I'm sorry,
Dr. Nagakawa.

17
00:00:47,250 --> 00:00:50,208
You surprised me. So you know
I'm from the devil realm?

18
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,666
[NAGAKAWA]
Yes.

19
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,166
And the reason you're here
is to search for a partner.

20
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:55,958
[ULLR]
You mean a spouse.

21
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:59,041
[NAGAKAWA] And then you'll
rule the devil realm.

22
00:00:59,125 --> 00:01:00,708
I wish you luck.

23
00:01:00,791 --> 00:01:01,958
[KIKKO gasps]

24
00:01:03,250 --> 00:01:05,250
Then, you aren't afraid of me.

25
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,708
Afraid of us?
Or where we're from?

26
00:01:09,125 --> 00:01:12,583
No, not at all. You gain
power from human happiness.

27
00:01:12,666 --> 00:01:15,541
In my eyes, that makes you
a superhuman of justice.

28
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:16,958
[KIKKO gasps]

29
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,791
[KIKKO] I didn't know there
were people who researched

30
00:01:25,875 --> 00:01:27,291
the devil realm.

31
00:01:27,375 --> 00:01:30,500
[ULLR] Yes. You can talk
to him for advice.

32
00:03:05,541 --> 00:03:08,416
[RAITO] So you're saying this
bloodbath is Claude's doing?

33
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:10,166
[JIRO]
Yes. It's him.

34
00:03:10,250 --> 00:03:12,333
Kikko was here and
witnessed the whole thing.

35
00:03:12,416 --> 00:03:15,583
But she doesn't remember
much or want to talk.

36
00:03:15,666 --> 00:03:16,791
[TAKI]
Don't bother.

37
00:03:16,875 --> 00:03:19,000
We'll never truly
understand witches.

38
00:03:19,083 --> 00:03:21,375
Their motivations
are otherworldly.

39
00:03:21,458 --> 00:03:22,750
Sorry?

40
00:03:22,833 --> 00:03:24,166
Forgive me.

41
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,333
I'm Taki from the Strange Power
Risk Management Office.

42
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,750
This is Takahara.

43
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:30,416
The police requested our help.

44
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,458
Whenever there's a
crime that abuses magic

45
00:03:32,541 --> 00:03:34,000
and science we
offer our services.

46
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:39,041
[TAKI KIDS giggle]

47
00:03:41,416 --> 00:03:42,833
[KIKKO gasps]

48
00:03:50,375 --> 00:03:53,000
[TAKI] The ashes solidify a
moment carved into space

49
00:03:53,083 --> 00:03:55,041
and recreate the
scene of the crime.

50
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,125
A very basic form of magic.

51
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:59,291
[KAEDE] What grudge did
Claude have against these

52
00:03:59,375 --> 00:04:01,791
doctors and nurses?

53
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:03,916
[TAKI KIDS gasp]

54
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,708
[JIRO gasps]

55
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,000
[EMI grunts]

56
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:27,958
[TAKI] We believe all the
corpses are superhuman.

57
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:29,500
[RAITO]
Superhuman?

58
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,791
So the clinic was a front
for an illegal lab.

59
00:04:32,875 --> 00:04:34,375
[TAKI]
That's not the only thing.

60
00:04:34,458 --> 00:04:36,291
Those victims had
the same operations

61
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:37,875
as the crew of the Antares.

62
00:04:37,958 --> 00:04:40,541
Then someone told Claude
what was going on here.

63
00:04:40,625 --> 00:04:43,416
And he must have broken in to
avenge the dead superhumans.

64
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:46,958
Regardless of that,
he can't be forgiven.

65
00:04:47,041 --> 00:04:48,250
[JIRO]
Obviously.

66
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,750
[EMI]
Where's Mr. Jaguar?

67
00:04:52,833 --> 00:04:55,625
[AKITA] He's acting as a
bodyguard for Mr. Mitsuya.

68
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,041
[EMI]
Oh?

69
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:59,208
Didn't he create war simulations
that used superhumans

70
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:01,416
as hypothetical enemies?

71
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:02,666
It's wrong!

72
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:05,166
Why do we have to protect
someone like that?

73
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,625
You know Mr. Mitsuya
supports the new law

74
00:05:07,708 --> 00:05:09,791
that expands superhuman rights.

75
00:05:09,875 --> 00:05:12,208
He's our ally and we
have to guard him.

76
00:05:12,291 --> 00:05:14,166
Political bargaining.

77
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:16,583
He probably thinks it'll help
him centralize control

78
00:05:16,666 --> 00:05:20,625
over superhumans. I don't
like it, but we need his vote.

79
00:05:20,708 --> 00:05:23,500
He was trying to find a way to
put superhumans down with force!

80
00:05:23,583 --> 00:05:24,791
He's not on our side!

81
00:05:24,875 --> 00:05:26,750
Claude actually cares
about superhumans

82
00:05:26,833 --> 00:05:29,166
and we treat him
like he's a criminal!

83
00:05:32,125 --> 00:05:33,666
[KIKKO whimpers]

84
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,500
Kikko stop!

85
00:05:39,875 --> 00:05:42,333
What happened?
Between you and Claude?

86
00:05:42,416 --> 00:05:46,750
[KIKKO grunts] Jiro. Why don't
you tell me the truth?

87
00:05:46,833 --> 00:05:48,166
[gasps]

88
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:49,875
No one has to know.

89
00:05:49,958 --> 00:05:52,291
But please, at least
reveal your feelings to me.

90
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:53,791
[gasps]

91
00:05:53,875 --> 00:05:55,375
[KIKKO gasps]

92
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,250
[door clatters]

93
00:06:05,333 --> 00:06:08,708
Where'd Kikko go? Oh, you still
have that old photo?

94
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:10,625
Emi. Who is this?

95
00:06:10,708 --> 00:06:11,833
[EMI]
Huh?

96
00:06:13,291 --> 00:06:17,083
It's true. You don't remember...
anything that happened.

97
00:06:19,958 --> 00:06:22,375
[EMI]
Jin. That was his name.

98
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:25,291
Jin. So how do I find him?

99
00:06:25,375 --> 00:06:28,250
You can't... He's dead now.

100
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:30,000
He's dead?

101
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,375
Killed by Rainbow Knight.

102
00:06:31,458 --> 00:06:32,833
[gasps]

103
00:06:35,458 --> 00:06:38,333
[EMI] Remember what Yumihiko
from the BL Club said.

104
00:06:38,416 --> 00:06:40,291
He wasn't the only one.

105
00:06:40,375 --> 00:06:42,000
Rainbow Knight kidnapped
other children

106
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:43,833
during the Daitetsu Incident.

107
00:06:43,916 --> 00:06:45,166
[door clatters]

108
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:49,958
[gasps]
Shh! Mr. Jiro. We have a guest.

109
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:51,958
[MAGOTAKE] You want to bring up
the Daitetsu Incident now,

110
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,083
after all this time?

111
00:06:54,166 --> 00:06:56,375
[SATOMI]
Only as a friendly reminder.

112
00:06:56,458 --> 00:06:58,708
I didn't mean to upset you.

113
00:06:58,791 --> 00:07:01,916
[MAGOTAKE sighs] So you're
telling me he's Claude.

114
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:03,083
Is that right?

115
00:07:03,166 --> 00:07:04,541
You know, we really
must stop bickering

116
00:07:04,625 --> 00:07:06,041
with each other like this.

117
00:07:06,125 --> 00:07:07,375
After all, Magotake,

118
00:07:07,458 --> 00:07:10,166
you and I were both called
superhuman in the past.

119
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:15,041
[MAGOTAKE] You're home.
Jiro. Let me introduce you.

120
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:17,125
This is Mr. Yoshiaki Satomi.

121
00:07:17,208 --> 00:07:19,458
A good friend of mine
since before the war.

122
00:07:19,541 --> 00:07:22,041
Now I'm just an old man who
spends most of his time

123
00:07:22,125 --> 00:07:25,875
advising advertising firms.
Have you heard of Imperial Ads?

124
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,500
I know of them.

125
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,791
[SATOMI]
Sorry to trouble you.

126
00:07:29,875 --> 00:07:33,416
Wait. Imperial Ads
is backing Claude.

127
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:35,166
That's what we believe at least.

128
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:38,333
It's a new era. We no longer
sell goods to the public.

129
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,000
Now we're in the business
of promoting ideas.

130
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,791
Fantasies, if you will.

131
00:07:42,875 --> 00:07:45,541
Our plan is merely to sell a
perception of superhumans

132
00:07:45,625 --> 00:07:47,458
that everyone can look up to.

133
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:52,166
[sighs]

134
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:54,958
[JIRO]
How did you meet him?

135
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,833
In the war.

136
00:07:57,916 --> 00:08:00,875
I was doing research on
superhumans at the Ikuta Labs.

137
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:04,250
Satomi was conducting superhuman
military operations

138
00:08:04,333 --> 00:08:05,541
on the continent.

139
00:08:05,625 --> 00:08:08,083
So about that talk
you were having.

140
00:08:08,166 --> 00:08:10,458
Have anything to do with this?

141
00:08:10,541 --> 00:08:13,000
[MAGOTAKE gasps, chuckles]

142
00:08:13,083 --> 00:08:16,208
Hey! Look, it's Jin.
It's been a while, hasn't it?

143
00:08:16,291 --> 00:08:18,083
So you finally remembered?

144
00:08:18,166 --> 00:08:22,083
It isn't funny. I forgot
about him until this.

145
00:08:22,166 --> 00:08:24,833
I forgot... my friend.

146
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,958
And now you think
it might be him.

147
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:30,333
You're starting to believe Jin
and Claude are the same person.

148
00:08:30,416 --> 00:08:33,458
That's impossible.
Jin's dead. So I've heard.

149
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:37,291
If he is alive, he'd be
one year older than you.

150
00:08:37,375 --> 00:08:39,583
The two of you were inseparable.

151
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:40,875
[JIRO gasps]

152
00:08:42,875 --> 00:08:45,375
[NAGAKAWA] I was supposed
to call Jiro to Sapporo.

153
00:08:46,791 --> 00:08:51,291
Don't worry about him.
That witch will protect you.

154
00:08:51,375 --> 00:08:53,625
[NAGAKAWA]
I want Jiro to understand.

155
00:08:53,708 --> 00:08:55,958
[SATOMI]
He will, soon.

156
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,416
Well, it's time to get ready.

157
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:02,291
The US military already got
the tip. He's on his way.

158
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:06,625
[NAGAKAWA] Golubaya Laika.

[ULLR] Yes. The Iron Mask
Swordman saved us again.

[ULLR] Where were you,
Mr. Matsutaro?

[KIKKO]
Good question!

You always disappear at
the most important times!

[ULLR] I wonder, who is the

No! That's absurd!

[KIKKO grunts]
But... what if it is true?

176
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,625
He'd be a defender of justice,

without the Superhuman
Bureau ever knowing.

[KIKKO] ...he's not
against wearing one.

Hey now! It's Doctor Nagakawa!

Sorry.

189

I guess he seems more like a

[REIICHI] I heard Claude's

It inspired me.

I mean, maybe, superhumans are
capable of saving this world.

And it's not just a fantasy.

I know. But where do we start?

195
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:12,625
I'm not sure. But there's
got to be more than fighting

to hide my face from everyone.

Golubaya Laika?

00:11:37,166 --> 00:11:39,500
[EMI] There are multiple reports
from Hakko High School.

203
00:11:39,583 --> 00:11:41,708
A superhuman crashed
on the campus.

00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:43,708
[JIRO] They're all
claiming the same thing.

That his identity
is Golubaya Laika.

Golgol? Who's that again?

[EMI]
Golubaya Laika.

208
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,166
He manipulates gravity and
magnetism to fly at high speeds.

209
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,791
The first superhuman to fly
in space using just his body.

210
00:11:57,875 --> 00:12:00,625
[JIRO] Unlike Master Ultima
who's part spaceman,

211
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:03,250
Golubaya is a
superhuman from Earth.

212
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:05,791
Recently, he disobeyed
orders to attack

an enemy nation from space.

He told the media, preserving
the beauty of the planet

00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:13,125
was worth risking the life
of every superhuman.

demoted to a training center.

Why is he in Japan?

No way.

00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,750
You don't want that
to happen, do you?

314
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,375
[RAITO] Did you figure
out what Claude wants?

315
00:17:56,458 --> 00:17:58,833
The doctors killed in Sapporo.

316
00:17:58,916 --> 00:18:01,625
They were part of Ikuta
Labs before the war.

317
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:04,958
Ikuta... The superhuman
research lab.

318
00:18:05,041 --> 00:18:06,625
Dr. Hitoyoshi worked there.

319
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:07,958
Rumor is after the war,

320
00:18:08,041 --> 00:18:10,166
some of the researchers
were taken to the US,

321
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:12,375
where they were allowed
to continue their research.

322
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:15,041
And the Antares was
harbored on Bonin Island.

323
00:18:15,125 --> 00:18:17,250
Part of the Ogasawara Islands.

324
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,500
Ogasawara?

325
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:20,666
Territory commandeered
by the United States.

326
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:23,625
It returns to Japan's
control in June.

327
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:25,958
It wouldn't surprise me
if the US and Japan

328
00:18:26,041 --> 00:18:28,625
shared a superhuman
research facility there.

329
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:29,541
[gasps]

330
00:18:29,625 --> 00:18:31,083
[KAEDE]
Before he was shot down,

331
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:34,375
Golubaya Laika was flying
straight towards Boneen Island.

332
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,041
Maybe... he knew
something was going on.

333
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,291
That's all we can do.
We reveal the truth.

334
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,333
What you do with it is up to.

335
00:18:44,791 --> 00:18:47,666
[EMI] He says the scent
is definitely from here.

336
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,250
He's acting strange, though.

337
00:18:49,333 --> 00:18:51,541
Like he's scared of
whatever's inside.

338
00:18:51,625 --> 00:18:52,875
Wait out here.

339
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,791
[CLAUDE]
Yes. I know what you said.

340
00:18:58,875 --> 00:19:02,208
All the kidnapped children were
killed except for Daitetsu.

341
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:06,041
But that wasn't the truth.
They were alive and sent away.

342
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,375
Of course you had to lie.

343
00:19:07,458 --> 00:19:08,875
The fallout would
have been immense.

344
00:19:08,958 --> 00:19:10,791
[JIRO gasps]

345
00:19:10,875 --> 00:19:12,458
[CLAUDE]
It's true.

346
00:19:12,541 --> 00:19:15,083
The Rainbow Knight did
take several children.

347
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,083
In order to protect them.

348
00:19:17,166 --> 00:19:19,291
He wanted to save us
from being sent to the lab

349
00:19:19,375 --> 00:19:22,000
on Ogasawara island.

350
00:19:22,083 --> 00:19:23,916
Then why did you lie
and tell the media

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,041
he asked for a ransom?

352
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:28,250
You wanted to destroy the
Rainbow Knight's image

353
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:31,208
in the public eye.
To make him a criminal!

354
00:19:31,291 --> 00:19:35,083
The Rainbow Knight.
He never demanded a ransom.

355
00:19:35,166 --> 00:19:37,458
[CLAUDE] You labeled him
a dangerous superhuman.

356
00:19:37,541 --> 00:19:40,083
An enemy of the people.
You ended it all.

357
00:19:40,166 --> 00:19:43,166
I was watching when it happened.

358
00:19:43,250 --> 00:19:44,333
[JIRO grunts]

359
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,125
[grunts]

360
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:50,666
[MAGOTAKE]
We had our reasons.

361
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:54,000
The Rainbow Knight said
he'd reveal your existence.

362
00:19:54,083 --> 00:19:57,791
That superhuman experiments were
being performed on children.

363
00:19:57,875 --> 00:20:00,458
Quite simply. We believed
we needed an organization

364
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,916
to protect superhumans.
This was our opportunity.

365
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,333
If the legendary Rainbow Knight
turned out to be a criminal,

366
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,208
it would work to our advantage.

367
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:11,041
The government could strengthen
their grip on superhumans.

368
00:20:11,125 --> 00:20:14,208
A necessary sacrifice for
starting the Bureau.

369
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,041
You killed him?

370
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,583
[MAGOTAKE]
Yes.

371
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:22,208
You framed him to look like
a criminal. And murdered him?

372
00:20:22,291 --> 00:20:23,041
Father!

373
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:24,208
[MAGOTAKE]
Jiro?

374
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,125
Answer me Father!

375
00:20:31,125 --> 00:20:34,666
[CLAUDE] The truth was Rainbow
Knight was never a kidnapper.

376
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:35,583
Now you know.

377
00:20:35,666 --> 00:20:37,916
Jin. Is that you?

378
00:20:40,791 --> 00:20:44,666
Jin Nagakawa.
Been a while, hasn't it?

379
00:20:44,750 --> 00:20:48,916
I'll be honest. I barely
have any memories of you.

380
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:52,541
I can understand.
You were deeply traumatized.

381
00:20:52,625 --> 00:20:54,291
They did everything they
could to make you believe

382
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,125
your hero was a criminal.

383
00:20:56,208 --> 00:20:58,208
And assassinated
him as you watched.

384
00:20:58,291 --> 00:21:02,416
Was there a chance I could
have ended up like you?

385
00:21:02,500 --> 00:21:06,375
Of course. If you weren't the
adopted son of Magotake.

386
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:08,458
They'd have taken you
to Ogasawara,

387
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:11,250
cut up your body, peered deep
into your mind.

388
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:15,458
Fused you together with
machines, animals, viruses,

389
00:21:15,541 --> 00:21:16,708
or worse.

390
00:21:16,791 --> 00:21:19,958
Sometimes, other superhumans.

391
00:21:20,041 --> 00:21:22,125
Anything to bring
out your abilities.

392
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:23,916
They didn't have limits.

393
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,833
[CLAUDE] You see what
they did to me, Jiro?

394
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,375
[gasps]

395
00:21:38,458 --> 00:21:41,666
[CLAUDE] The Superhuman Bureau
does not protect superhumans.

396
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:42,958
[AKITA]
Jiro!

397
00:21:43,041 --> 00:21:44,333
[EMI]
Careful, Chief! He's armed!

398
00:21:44,416 --> 00:21:45,541
[CLAUDE]
Akita.

399
00:21:45,625 --> 00:21:47,750
[AKITA] If anyone's
responsible, it's me.

400
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,541
We were in such a hurry to
create the Superhuman Bureau.

401
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:51,833
I'll admit, mistakes were made.

402
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:52,541
[JIRO]
Chief?

403
00:21:52,625 --> 00:21:54,250
You have to believe me.

404
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:56,250
I only wanted to
protect superhumans.

405
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:57,416
For the sake of our planet.

406
00:21:57,500 --> 00:21:58,625
[JIRO gasps]

407
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,708
[CLAUDE] Don't make
me laugh. Our planet?

408
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:04,291
You really think I don't know
where you come from?

409
00:22:06,166 --> 00:22:07,166
[JIRO grunts]

410
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,666
[CLAUDE grunts]

411
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:23,916
[AKITA groans]

412
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:32,166
[CLAUDE] He's not one of us.
He's a freak from outer space.

413
00:24:03,708 --> 00:24:06,916
[AKITA] Fumers. We disassembled
our bodies to travel through

414
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:08,875
vast distances of space.

415
00:24:08,958 --> 00:24:12,166
We're here in search of beings
who can one day evolve

416
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:14,791
and become more like us.

417
00:24:14,875 --> 00:24:18,000
On this planet they're
called superhumans.
