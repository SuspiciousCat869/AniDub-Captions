Do you know what
it's true nature is?

180
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,666
It's operated by a superhuman

[CLAUDE] Its superior

used in conflicts

Or in petty squabbles
between other superhumans.

188
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,916
We should be focused on

a brighter future.

the Antares was the first

He was responsible for more
than seventy deaths today.

00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:00,041
Yeah. But you're including
the crew of the submarine,

You're right.

The chief will contact
the US about that,

and we'll get to the
bottom of what's going on.

[KIKKO] The submarine's

Shouldn't we have

It doesn't mean that
I can forgive Claude.

at exactly the right time.

He's most likely
connected to Imperial Ads.

Imperial Ads is just a
stupid advertising agency.

Why are you so
hostile towards them?

Because--

Superhumans are a type of human.

307

Anyway, Claude isn't superhuman.

Mr. Akita.

325
00:16:29,833 --> 00:16:31,458
Let's cut to the chase.

326
00:16:31,541 --> 00:16:33,958
The minister is for
the Revised Secrecy Laws.

327
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,000
The Ministry of Health and
Welfare is submitting them

328
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:37,500
to the legislature.

329
00:16:37,583 --> 00:16:39,625
That's right. In full support.

330
00:16:39,708 --> 00:16:41,166
Please, take a seat.

331
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,416
Pardon my asking,
but you're aware

332
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,500
the Japanese government
secretly employs

333
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:52,458
superhuman soldiers in the
country's security forces?

334
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:53,916
This new Superhuman law.

335
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,250
It'll effectively
ban that practice.

336
00:16:56,333 --> 00:16:57,333
Not to worry.

337
00:16:57,416 --> 00:16:58,750
We're covered.

338
00:16:58,833 --> 00:17:01,000
If they register themselves
as a superhuman,

339
00:17:01,083 --> 00:17:02,500
they can volunteer.

340
00:17:02,583 --> 00:17:04,458
It's not a total ban.

341
00:17:04,541 --> 00:17:07,416
Defense.
Foreign affairs. Police.

342
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:09,958
Mr. Mitsuya will help
pull all the different

343
00:17:10,041 --> 00:17:11,333
disciplines together.

344
00:17:11,416 --> 00:17:14,916
But you see,
in order to do that--

345
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,791
we have to make sure longhaired
kids with electric guitars

346
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:20,916
aren't inspired by
subversives like this.

347
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:23,875
Are you proposing
that we make a deal?

348
00:17:23,958 --> 00:17:26,291
[CROWD chattering]

349
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,125
We need to discuss it
with the Americans

350
00:17:28,208 --> 00:17:29,791
before we take action.

351
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,583
But this Claude
villain is an enemy,

352
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,250
and must be dealt with sternly.

353
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,916
[REPORTER 11A] Minister,
what about those who say

354
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,375
he's a superhuman of justice,

355
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:39,541
who revealed the Antares
was an inhumane weapon?

356
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,750
Really?

357
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,208
If he is right,
and on the side of justice,

358
00:17:43,291 --> 00:17:44,833
wouldn't that make
the U.S. military

359
00:17:44,916 --> 00:17:46,750
and the Japanese
government evil?

360
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,166
[TAKI] You took quite
a beating, Detective.

361
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:52,958
[KIDS chattering]

362
00:17:59,916 --> 00:18:01,625
I don't approve
of these tools!

363
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,500
There's nothing to worry about.

364
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:06,458
Advanced technology
is identical to magic.

365
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:08,333
Our magic is science.

366
00:18:08,416 --> 00:18:09,708
There's no difference.

367
00:18:09,791 --> 00:18:12,250
We're officially commissioned
by the police force.

368
00:18:12,333 --> 00:18:15,416
Please relax.
It'll make things much easier.

369
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,625
Then I'm going
to need your help.

370
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:19,500
I want to find out
who Claude is.

371
00:18:19,583 --> 00:18:20,916
That's no problem.

372
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,250
There's no mystery
we can't uncover.

373
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:25,083
That's the motto
of us Sciencers.

374
00:18:25,166 --> 00:18:26,458
We'll get to the truth.

Dreamers and fools.
The Bureau protects them all.

376

[TAKI, KAEDE]
Huh?

377
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,708
[ULLR] Are you sure you want
to go alone, Star Child?

378
00:18:43,125 --> 00:18:45,750
[CLAUDE] Miss Kikko.
I want to show you something.

379
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:56,125
Whatever's inside,
maybe it's something

380
00:18:56,208 --> 00:18:58,333
for my eyes only.

381
00:18:58,416 --> 00:19:01,041
[ULLR] Star Child.
If this turns out to be nothing,

382
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:04,166
you have to buy me
miso butter ramen for dinner.

383
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,750
It's been two months.
And no sign of Claude.

384
00:19:06,833 --> 00:19:08,208
It must be important.

Why did you... kill them?

Tell me.

Bring forth my Comet Tail.

Explain yourself, human.

404
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:35,708
Why this terrible act?

[CLAUDE] Listen to me.
Future queen of the devil realm.

406
00:21:39,083 --> 00:21:41,291
There's a reason I had
to kill these people.

407
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,125
For justice?

408
00:21:45,208 --> 00:21:48,958
[CLAUDE] As a superhuman,
I cannot allow evil to live.

409
00:21:49,041 --> 00:21:51,583
I must destroy it
wherever it thrives.

410
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,750
[KIKKO]
One more question, Claude.

411
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:04,791
Tell me.

Are you somebody I know?

Yes.

I thought so.

the pursuit of freedom

Justice fights justice
in the name of peace.

Even today, your justice
invades my freedom.

Tell me now.
What reason do you fight for?
