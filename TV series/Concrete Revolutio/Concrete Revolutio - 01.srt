00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,958
[JIRO] When Grosse Augen
goes giant-size,

164
00:12:18,041 --> 00:12:20,250
he shifts the surrounding
Temporal Phase,

165
00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:23,333
basically becoming invisible
to normal humans like me.

166
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:25,375
Tempura-what now?

167
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:27,041
The Fred &amp; Hoyle effect.

168
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,541
Let me try and
explain it another way.

169
00:12:29,625 --> 00:12:31,000
Imagine a film reel.

170
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,916
As it plays, we perceive the
image as seamless motion.

171
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,708
But in reality,
there are blank spaces

172
00:12:35,791 --> 00:12:37,083
between the frames.

173
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:39,583
Gaps in time,
invisible to the human eye,

174
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:42,083
but every bit as real
as the images we see.

175
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,000
That's where Grosse Augen goes,

176
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,791
phasing into the
"gaps" between time.

177
00:12:46,875 --> 00:12:48,625
I bet it's because he
doesn't wanna hurt people

178
00:12:48,708 --> 00:12:50,541
or destroy any buildings
while he's beating up

179
00:12:50,625 --> 00:12:51,583
the bad guys.

180
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,833
Who knows?

181
00:12:52,916 --> 00:12:54,791
This Kikai does have an
observation mechanism

182
00:12:54,875 --> 00:12:55,916
in it, but--

183
00:12:57,750 --> 00:13:00,250
I honestly haven't the
first clue how to read it!

184
00:13:00,333 --> 00:13:02,458
And besides, I really
ought to keep my eyes

185
00:13:02,541 --> 00:13:03,416
on the road.

186
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,708
[KIKKO chuckles]

187
00:13:05,833 --> 00:13:08,583
So um, just who are you?

188
00:13:08,666 --> 00:13:10,833
[JIRO] Superhumans
protect human peace, right?

189
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:14,250
Well, who do you think
protects all the superhumans?

190
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,500
[KIKKO]
Huh?

191
00:13:15,583 --> 00:13:16,583
[JIRO] They're forced
to hide their identities

192
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,125
just to live among
normal humans.

193
00:13:19,208 --> 00:13:21,625
We're the ones who're
tasked with protecting them.

194
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,833
Nowadays, they don't have
to keep switching jobs,

195
00:13:23,916 --> 00:13:26,208
or be forced to move
from place to place.

196
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,708
[KIKKO]
You can do it, Grosse Augen!

197
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:34,000
The evil alien's
straight up ahead!

198
00:13:34,083 --> 00:13:35,708
Right this way!

199
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,250
All right.

Whoa! What is that?

A literal iron horse?

203
00:13:50,166 --> 00:13:51,333
Where is he?

204
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,166
Right, got it!

I will not allow you to

[KIKKO]
Watch out! A heat ray!

214
00:14:32,916 --> 00:14:34,833
I could protect Jiro
with an air shield.

215
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:36,833
Or would that act like
a lens and make it worse?

know these things.

You don't want to fail
another test, do you?

Do you have to
rub that in right now?!

Tracked me down again, huh?

[EMI] You've been injected
with fluids from a monster

called Nuppepoo.

Don't feel anything, do you?

Well, it smells so sweet,
you can never hide.

No matter how far you run,

I'll always be able
to track you...

Grosse Augen?

253
00:17:14,041 --> 00:17:16,791
[EMI] You've forcibly possessed
and are living inside a human.

254
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,583
Because of this,
both of your bodies

255
00:17:18,666 --> 00:17:19,791
are reaching their limits.

256
00:17:19,875 --> 00:17:21,208

When I found him,

266
00:17:59,125 --> 00:18:01,375
I could tell he
was close to death.

267
00:18:01,458 --> 00:18:03,708
His soul spoke to me,
and I answered.

268
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:05,750
There was only
one way to save him.

269
00:18:05,833 --> 00:18:08,041
I knew what I had to do.

270
00:18:08,125 --> 00:18:09,250
I agreed.

271
00:18:09,333 --> 00:18:11,916
"I will give you my life
so you might live."

272
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,500
"But in exchange,
to save this planet,

273
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,625
you must fight alongside me."

274
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,916
[JIRO] The way I see it, Grosse
Augen took over your body,

275
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:24,916
and is in fact controlling you.

276
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:27,750
Your existences are
unstable. Dangerous.

277
00:18:27,833 --> 00:18:28,875
I don't get it.

278
00:18:28,958 --> 00:18:30,541
Nothing bad happened
when Grosse Augen

279
00:18:30,625 --> 00:18:33,083
fought aliens in the past--
why's this time different?

280
00:18:33,166 --> 00:18:36,500
I understand. And thank you.

281
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,666
But no.

282
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:40,166
I gave my life so
Grosse Augen could live.

283
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,458
I intend to keep that promise.

284

Just so we're clear,
you'd give up everything?

285
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:48,458
You can't tell us that
you dying is no big deal!

286
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,541
It's true Grosse Augen's
body has reached its limit.

287

But it's still possible
for him to return

You said you protected
superhumans and kept them safe!

00:19:47,666 --> 00:19:50,083
And I dispose of
the dangerous ones.

00:19:50,166 --> 00:19:51,666
That's my other job.

303
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:55,166
[ONDA] Due to the Gemini
Accident in America,

304
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:56,625
our collimators stopped working

305

and we couldn't
procure new ones.

306

He said he could get
me the latest model--

307
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,916
that my research was
too important to stop.

308
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,875
To think, I was
dealing with an alien!

309
00:20:05,958 --> 00:20:07,750
The Gemini Accident
was probably caused

by an "S" Planetarian as well.

Take a look at this.

00:20:13,916 --> 00:20:16,166
It does detect x-ray
sources more accurately

313
00:20:16,250 --> 00:20:19,083
than any technology
available here on Earth.

314
00:20:19,166 --> 00:20:20,916
And yet--

315
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,625
Anyone can freely
change the data

316
00:20:22,708 --> 00:20:24,166
with external radio waves,

317
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,708
making the readings
completely worthless.

00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:29,291
But why? Why would
someone do all this?

any evil aliens next time.

00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:39,708
[JIRO] So there never
was any information,

323
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,708
or at least none worth stealing.

324
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:43,958
[HYOUMA] Well, we did succeed
in locating Grosse Augen

325
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:46,083
and successfully
confirmed his identity.

326
00:20:46,166 --> 00:20:47,208
Don't complain.

327
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:48,875
[AKITA]
The "S" Planetarian likely came

328
00:20:48,958 --> 00:20:50,958
from a base of theirs
believed to be on the planet

329
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:53,166
called Scorpio-X1.

330
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:55,000
I imagine they're
not too keen on us

331
00:20:55,083 --> 00:20:56,500
confirming its existence.

332
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:57,750
[knocking]

333
00:20:59,541 --> 00:21:00,625
[EMI]
Hello.

334
00:21:00,708 --> 00:21:02,708
Ah. Welcome!

335
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,750
What... is this?

336
00:21:04,833 --> 00:21:06,291
It's your new gig.

337
00:21:07,125 --> 00:21:10,208
Welcome to the Super
Population Research Lab.

338
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,791
Starting today, you're
an official team member.

339
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:20,791
[KIKKO]
You're Grosse Augen.

340
00:21:20,875 --> 00:21:21,958
But you--

341
00:21:36,125 --> 00:21:38,708
[SHIROTA] That day,
in exchange for separating me

342
00:21:38,791 --> 00:21:40,916
from Grosse Augen
and freeing him,

343
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,208
he let me merge
with the captured alien.

344
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:45,458
The "S" Planetarian.

345
00:21:45,541 --> 00:21:48,375
If my heart was dedicated
to order and peace,

346
00:21:48,458 --> 00:21:51,625
I'd be able to control
its body and mind.

347
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:54,416
And once again become
a superhuman of justice.

348
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,333
[KIKKO]
Come to think of it,

349
00:21:58,416 --> 00:22:00,875
I do remember several
reports of an "S" Planetarian

350
00:22:00,958 --> 00:22:02,291
that was fighting <i>kaiju</i> .

351
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:06,958
You went against the
Superhuman Bureau that day.

352
00:22:07,041 --> 00:22:09,625
You didn't kill him,
you saved him!

353
00:22:09,708 --> 00:22:11,166
Jiro, you really are the one I--

354
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,500
I'm finished with
the Superhuman Bureau!

355
00:22:19,375 --> 00:22:20,750
[JIRO]
Farewell, Kikko!

356
00:24:03,583 --> 00:24:04,666
[FUUROUTA]
Hey, guys!

357
00:24:04,750 --> 00:24:06,250
You know the skinny
on ghosts, right?

358
00:24:06,333 --> 00:24:08,958
We're not like all those other
monsters, beasts, and spirits!

359
00:24:09,041 --> 00:24:11,541
Ghosts love playing with kids.
It's in our nature.

360
00:24:11,625 --> 00:24:13,541
We're friendly creatures
who love playing pranks

361
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:14,875
on all the squares out there!

362
00:24:14,958 --> 00:24:16,375
I'm Fuurouta the ghost.

363
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:17,541
Don't forget it!
