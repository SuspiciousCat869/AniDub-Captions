you made this country girl

[MICHIKO] That's what the
Marketing Division does, sir.

This assignment comes directly

13

Satomi's been with us

system in his rocketship.

The <i>kaiju</i> he captured on Mars

00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:52,458
was mass produced,
turned into a weapon,

19
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,291
and is now used
by the US military

20

all over the world.

Some are saying

Well, we're definitely

Now, our top story.

28
00:02:46,666 --> 00:02:48,250
The US Defense
Department announced

29
00:02:48,333 --> 00:02:50,333
that the <i>kaiju</i> assigned
to its Okinawa base

30
00:02:50,416 --> 00:02:51,375
has died.

31
00:02:51,458 --> 00:02:52,666
The carcass was
reportedly discarded

32
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,125
off the coast
of Kikaijima Island.

[HYOUMA]
A "Broken Lance." Jeez.

34
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,458
That's what they're calling
these types of incidents.

35
00:02:59,541 --> 00:03:01,458
<i>Kaiju</i> from places like
Greenland and Spain

36
00:03:01,541 --> 00:03:03,625
have supposedly been
disposed of, too.

37
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,416
Meaning they're
killing them all.

00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,291
Well there's nothin' here.

39
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:09,458
Who knows,
maybe the fish ate it.

40
00:03:09,541 --> 00:03:12,041
Ooh! And speaking of eating!

41
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,291
Yeah, thanks.

42
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,291
Maybe it was never
here to begin with.

43
00:03:18,375 --> 00:03:19,916
[MICHIKO] If it wasn't
thrown in the ocean,

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,708
where was it really taken?

45
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,375
It'll be in Tokyo soon.

00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:26,000
You'll be in charge of
directing its public debut.

47
00:03:26,083 --> 00:03:29,000
The campaign'll include
magazines, television, radio.

Hell, even word-of-mouth.

Aren't you going to ask me why?

50
00:03:33,291 --> 00:03:34,916
In my business,
I've found it's best

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,666
not to ask why.
But I can venture a guess.

52
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,791
[SATOMI]
Is that so?

00:03:39,875 --> 00:03:41,291
Enlighten me.

[MICHIKO] Okinawa gets
returned in a few years.

55
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,458
The Japanese public
needs to outgrow its fear

56
00:03:45,541 --> 00:03:47,041
of <i>kaiju</i> before then.

57
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:49,125
My guess is,
this job came down

58
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,208
from the government in Roppongi?

59

Have you heard of
the Superhuman Bureau?

00:03:54,958 --> 00:03:57,583
I haven't, Advisor.
Please, enlighten me.

[SATOMI]
Remember their name.

So what I think is,

00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:12,625
we should be listening to them.

What do you mean?

Listening to <i>kaiju</i> ?

69
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:18,791
[MALE TV] Well, they were on the
Earth since we were primates.

70
00:04:18,875 --> 00:04:20,833
And now we want to
use them for our wars?

Kill them in our struggles?

72
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:23,708
Since we're on
the subject of war,

73
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:25,833
how about the
U.S. military working

Japan was shut down,

00:04:32,125 --> 00:04:34,125
and the number of

You don't think I ate it?

what are <i>kaiju</i> anyway?

100
00:05:27,083 --> 00:05:28,583
[KIKKO] At the time,
a nationwide debate

was raging about <i>kaiju</i> .

Were they evil?
Victims of human intrusion?

103

Everyone had an opinion.

104

The younger generation
were sympathetic to them,

in particular.

106
00:05:38,125 --> 00:05:39,791
It was as though
the debate was fueling

some kind of agenda.

Ugh. It must have died.

One of America's <i>kaiju</i> .

I hope you know some way
to revive this thing.

187
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,833
We'll use GaGon's cells.

Their regenerative
powers are unequaled.

After I inject
this into its body,

it'll grow double its size.

I've tested it many times.

[UKYO]
This is a cellular invigorator.

193
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,583
It enhances the biological
structure of any <i>kaiju</i> .

194
00:09:03,666 --> 00:09:04,958
Just a single injection,

195
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:07,750
and you can create a
dragon out of a lizard's tail.

Just as I promised.

to make some money.

And then?

It's not anyone's weapon.

We've taken out too many <i>kaiju</i> .

If we intervene now,

we'll be branded
as enemies of peace,

and the students will
side against us.

But the way they made
Jiro lose control like that--

266
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,625
it's an attack against
the Superhuman Bureau.

267

There is another way.

268

Say an accident happens.

Tonight at exactly 1:40 AM,
at the Shinjuku West bridge,

a cargo train and tanker
carrying American jet fuel

271

A series of small mistakes
results in a collision.

273
00:12:35,083 --> 00:12:36,541
Then a fire.

274
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:38,833
[AKITA] An explosion large
enough to destroy a <i>kaiju</i>

275
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,041
of that size.

276
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:41,750
Civilian casualties
would be minimal

277
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:43,500
due to the hour of the crash.

278
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,333

will say the driver

who can see into the future.

Of course he doesn't know.

Such a sweetheart.

If he doesn't know the truth,
then what's the point

of letting him
stay on this job?

307

He's seriously injured.

He's far stronger

The only people
qualified to love him...

to an abrupt end.

482
00:25:26,083 --> 00:25:28,875
It was soon followed by
the so-called monster craze.

483
00:25:28,958 --> 00:25:31,125
A different story.
For another time.

484
00:25:33,375 --> 00:25:35,125
[DON] Prepare yourself,
my fellow viewers:

485
00:25:35,208 --> 00:25:36,791
It's time for Mountain Horse!

486
00:25:36,875 --> 00:25:38,666
Haru, Freeze, Dee,
and yours truly,

487
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:39,958
Don, their leader.

488
00:25:40,041 --> 00:25:42,125
It's all fun-and-games
when we get together.

489
00:25:42,208 --> 00:25:43,416
No one ever died from laughter,

490
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:45,291
so do it to your
heart's content!

491
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:47,625
Uh, I'm gonna excuse myself now.
