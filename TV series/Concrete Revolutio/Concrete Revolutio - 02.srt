00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,500
Scandal.

320
00:14:50,583 --> 00:14:52,583
The way I heard it is
back when she was in college,

321
00:14:52,666 --> 00:14:54,750
Miss Emi was Professor
Hitoyoshi's assistant,

322
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:56,416
which is how she first met Jiro.

323
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:57,791
Then they both got
jobs at the Bureau

324
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,125
where the professor's
an advisor,

325
00:14:59,208 --> 00:15:00,291
and the rest is history.

326
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:01,833
[FUUROUTA]
Yeah, but they live together!

327
00:15:01,916 --> 00:15:04,083
And they're going steady,
so it's fine!

328
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:05,333
[FUUROUTA]
Why are you mad at me?

329
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:06,666
I'm just letting you know!

330
00:15:06,750 --> 00:15:09,041
I figured it out on
my own a long time ago!

331
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,125
But it doesn't freak me out
so much that I wanna quit!

332
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:14,250
And you're wrong! I took
this job to help the planet,

333
00:15:14,333 --> 00:15:15,916
not chase after some stupid boy!

334

interest to run, little boy.

[FUUROUTA]
Superhuman Bureau, freeze!

338
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,125
That's your only warning!

00:15:30,208 --> 00:15:31,916
[CAMPE]
I've been looking for you.

340
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,666
At last, I've grown
enough to exact my revenge!

341
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:35,666
[FUUROUTA]
What did you say?

342
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,375
Fuurouta! Die!

343
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,250
[FUUROUTA]
Hitoyoshi!

344
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:48,791
Long time no see, Fuurouta.

345
00:15:48,875 --> 00:15:51,083
You haven't changed a bit.

346
00:15:51,166 --> 00:15:53,208
Very funny. Why are you here?

347
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,208
[CAMPE yells]

[JIRO grunts]

349
00:16:01,375 --> 00:16:03,041
I said no! Campe!

350
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,916
Campe?

00:16:08,666 --> 00:16:09,625

[FUUROUTA gasps]

354
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,375
[AKITA] As you know,
all the superhumans

355
00:16:25,458 --> 00:16:27,083
employed by the
Public Security Force

have been killed in action.

357
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:30,958
With that, we can't
allow the Tartaros Bugmen

358
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:33,250
to continue operating
on their own agenda.

359
00:16:33,333 --> 00:16:35,000
[HYOUMA] But yesterday
they told us to keep our noses

360
00:16:35,083 --> 00:16:36,500
out of it.

361
00:16:36,583 --> 00:16:38,375
[JIRO] Regardless, we can't
just ignore their occupation

362
00:16:38,458 --> 00:16:39,916
of the Diet Building.

363
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,958
I'll do it.

364
00:16:41,041 --> 00:16:42,208
That's our Jiro.

365
00:16:42,291 --> 00:16:43,541
[JIRO]
However...

366
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:45,250
It's still possible they're
actually superhumans

367
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,500
who have turned to evil.

368
00:16:46,583 --> 00:16:48,666
If there's a chance to
negotiate, I'll take it.

369
00:16:48,750 --> 00:16:50,833
[FUUROUTA] All we gotta do
is stop the bad guys, right?

370
00:16:50,916 --> 00:16:53,250
Why not let me handle that? Huh?

371
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,208
Brr!

372
00:16:54,291 --> 00:16:55,458
Watch it!

373
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:56,916
The virus is only inert
as long as it's in that

liquid nitrogen.

375
00:16:58,958 --> 00:17:00,666
Have you forgotten
the only reason you're here

376
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,083
is to meet with a lawyer?

377
00:17:02,166 --> 00:17:03,958
[FUUROUTA] But I know the
enemy better than you.

378
00:17:04,041 --> 00:17:06,166
Not to mention, I'm the only
one who can enter the fog

379
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,875
and not be affected by it.

00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:11,333
This is my chance
to do something good.

382

Really?

00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:13,500
Yeah, and if I pull it off,

00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,333
how about ya let me
join the Bureau?

[CAMPE]
And that's all there was to it.

Guess I must've got 'em.

00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,375
They were right on top of us!

00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,833
Wha--? Hey!

398
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:25,291
I can't always save you,
so don't get caught by humans

00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:27,875
or Tartaros Bugmen anymore!

00:18:27,958 --> 00:18:29,041
You let one get away?

00:18:29,125 --> 00:18:30,416
Of course I didn't.

402
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:32,208
That one was just
a really big bug.

403
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,375
Since I'm a ghost,

404
00:18:33,458 --> 00:18:35,666
I can totally talk to
animals and stuff.

405
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:40,916
[CAMPE] Just like that,
this queen lost her people.

406
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,458
You don't mean--?

407
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:45,458
I was young and foolish,
so I was caught by humans.

408
00:18:45,541 --> 00:18:47,833
I was about to be
sold like a pet.

409
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:50,291
The Black Fog had
come to save me.

410
00:18:50,375 --> 00:18:53,208
But you had freed me
by the time it arrived.

411
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:56,250
No. That can't be true.

412
00:18:56,333 --> 00:18:58,041
Tartaros Bugmen.

413
00:18:58,125 --> 00:19:01,291
They've kept to Japan's
woods since the time of myth.

414
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,083
That was the contract
they formed with humankind.

415
00:19:04,166 --> 00:19:07,541
However, modern politicians
forgot about that agreement,

416
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,708
and sold off the
national forests.

417
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,416
As a result, the Bugmen
lost their habitat,

418
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,208
and soon came to punish
those responsible.

419
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,833
So they brought the Black Fog.

420
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,125
[FUUROUTA]
That's awful.

were looking for me.

and there was no way

any of that back then!

I was so happy.

I thought there was
actually someone out there

them were anything but.

No, Jiro.

[FUUROUTA gasps]

compensate for what she lost.

That said, taking
Fuurouta's life

for what he's done!

455
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,166
I know.

456
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:35,375
Because you were friends,
it hurt all the more.

457

But can you forgive him now,

because you're still friends?

Look at me. Please.

I'm all grown up now.

But you're still exactly
the same as when we met.

We're from different worlds.

We cannot be friends.

[FUUROUTA] Things were so
much easier in the old days.

[JIRO]
Yeah.

00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,208
so I can fix all
the wrong stuff!

479
00:21:33,291 --> 00:21:36,166
[JIRO] Don't say that.
You stay the way you are.

480
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:38,583
[FUUROUTA crying]

481
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:39,666
[JIRO]
It's fine.

482
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:43,208
[FUUROUTA crying]

483
00:21:45,916 --> 00:21:48,625
[AKITA] As for the matter of
letting Fuurouta join us or not,

484
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:51,291
those in favor please
raise your hands.

485
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:53,333
I think he could be useful.

486
00:21:53,416 --> 00:21:54,958
[AKITA] Not to mention,
having a ghost around

487
00:21:55,041 --> 00:21:57,125
will be entertaining.

488
00:21:57,208 --> 00:21:58,500
How 'bout you?

489
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:01,125
Well, I'd say,
this isn't exactly the place

490
00:22:01,208 --> 00:22:02,541
where a kid should
be hanging around

491
00:22:02,625 --> 00:22:03,875
and getting into trouble.

492
00:22:03,958 --> 00:22:05,125
So no.

493
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:07,000
And I've been against
it from the beginning.

494
00:22:07,083 --> 00:22:08,166
So uh...

495
00:22:09,458 --> 00:22:11,375
--Come on!
--Really? Why?

496
00:22:11,458 --> 00:22:13,041
Because.

497
00:22:13,125 --> 00:22:15,083
He thinks we protect
good superhumans

498
00:22:15,166 --> 00:22:17,041
and fight evil in all its forms.

499
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:18,541
He does?

500
00:22:18,625 --> 00:22:22,250
With him here, there's no
way I'll be able to forget that.

501
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,583
Thing is, we need him.

502
00:22:28,166 --> 00:22:31,166
[JIRO]
It's fine. Stay the way you are.

503
00:24:03,416 --> 00:24:05,958
[RAITO] As the only Metropolitan
Police Department Detective

504
00:24:06,041 --> 00:24:07,791
who handles superhuman cases.

505
00:24:07,875 --> 00:24:10,250
And with the soul of justice
in my steel body.

506
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:13,000
I work in secret for
people's peace and safety.

507
00:24:13,083 --> 00:24:14,500
Don't call me superhuman.

508
00:24:14,583 --> 00:24:16,083
Call me Detective.

509
00:24:16,166 --> 00:24:17,291
Raito Shiba!
