[TEACHER 9A] In regards
to the origin of life,

7
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:31,083
the most popular theory is that
it started simply by chance.

8
00:02:31,166 --> 00:02:32,375
Over several thousand years,

9
00:02:32,458 --> 00:02:35,041
elements in the ocean
formed a protein.

10
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:37,750
And a gradual chemical
evolution took place.

11
00:02:37,833 --> 00:02:40,750
This resulted in creating
the Primordial soup.

12
00:02:40,833 --> 00:02:42,791
Without this
miraculous occurrence,

13
00:02:42,875 --> 00:02:45,166
the Earth would be
completely devoid of life.

But, I can't mention
that info to the Bureau.
