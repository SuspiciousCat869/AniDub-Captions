desire to merge,

which is the driving
force behind their search

"Combining" is their
most unique feature,

I've been looking for.

320
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,416
I know that. But that
man's not here anymore.

321
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,208
He's gone.

322
00:15:02,291 --> 00:15:03,458
[MIEKO gasps]

323
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:12,500
[JIRO]
A robot that thought for itself

324
00:15:12,583 --> 00:15:14,833
and decided to rebel
against its maker.

325
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,958
That's how I
imagined it, anyway.

326
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,625
Like a ninja, disappearing
to find justice.

327
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:21,083
Justice?

328
00:15:21,166 --> 00:15:23,833
But that's not what
Miss Mieko is after.

329
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,791
She's just searching
for a loved one.

330
00:15:25,875 --> 00:15:27,375
It's not love.

331
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,833
The only reason
they look for each other

332
00:15:28,916 --> 00:15:30,041
is 'cause they're made to.

333
00:15:30,125 --> 00:15:33,000
So? I think
people are the same way.

334
00:15:33,083 --> 00:15:35,583
We seek out love,
no matter what the cost.

335
00:15:35,666 --> 00:15:37,750
It's a simple fact of life!

336
00:15:37,833 --> 00:15:41,500
And in a way, finding love
is its own kind of justice.

337
00:15:41,583 --> 00:15:43,708
Shiba thinks justice
can only be served

338
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:44,875
by destroying her.

339
00:15:47,125 --> 00:15:48,500
But why?

340
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,125
Isn't there a way we can
both be right about this?

341
00:15:52,458 --> 00:15:53,333
[MIEKO]
You're wrong.

342
00:15:53,416 --> 00:15:54,541
I am going to find him,

343
00:15:54,625 --> 00:15:56,750
and I won't give up
my search until I do.

344
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:59,500
Things just need to stop
getting in my way first.

345
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,791
Everything that's happened
has been a byproduct

346
00:16:01,875 --> 00:16:03,708
of the way you were designed.

347
00:16:03,791 --> 00:16:05,958
You were built with
an artificial love.

348
00:16:06,041 --> 00:16:08,166
And it draws you to robots
that were manufactured

349
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,541
with the same
Yatsuka technology.

350
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:13,125
[MIEKO]
Is that why I'm drawn to you?

351
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:16,291
[RAITO]
Mieko!

352
00:16:23,708 --> 00:16:24,833
[HYOUMA]
All right, Jiro.

353
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,125
Time's frozen in a
hundred-meter radius.

354
00:16:27,208 --> 00:16:28,708
But I can only hold it
for the equivalent

355
00:16:28,791 --> 00:16:30,541
of thirty seconds.

356
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:31,833
You know what to do.

357
00:16:33,416 --> 00:16:34,416
I'm on it.

358
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,500
Now Equus, rear your head!

359
00:16:56,458 --> 00:16:57,625
[HYOUMA panting] 

360
00:16:57,708 --> 00:16:59,208
[KIKKO]
Oh, gosh!

361
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,166
Hope it was enough,
and that no one noticed.

362
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,083
[MIEKO]
What the--? How did--?

363
00:17:08,166 --> 00:17:11,083
[JIRO] Sorry about this.
I followed the detective.

364
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,083
I knew if I stayed close to him,
you'd show up eventually.

365
00:17:14,166 --> 00:17:15,083
[MIEKO]
But why?

366
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,375
[RAITO]
It's simple.

367
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:18,291
I have the same basic design
as the male Type B

368
00:17:18,375 --> 00:17:20,083
that was built alongside you.

369
00:17:20,166 --> 00:17:23,291
That's why I reacted so much
when we came in contact.

370
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,458
Same as you.

371
00:17:24,541 --> 00:17:25,666
So that's it?

372
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:26,791
None of it's real?

373
00:17:26,875 --> 00:17:28,208
[JIRO]
Enough chatter.

374
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,625
We'll finish this later.

375
00:17:29,708 --> 00:17:31,916
I'm shutting her down
till we're somewhere safe.

376
00:17:33,541 --> 00:17:34,750
I think not!

377
00:17:34,833 --> 00:17:36,750
I'll finish this
by destroying her!

378
00:17:36,833 --> 00:17:37,833

379

I refuse to let

[JIRO, RAITO grunting]

383
00:17:56,875 --> 00:17:59,541
[MIEKO]
I have to know! Please!

384
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,416
Why won't you let me find him?

385
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:03,375
Tell me!

386
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,250
It's your purpose.

387
00:18:05,333 --> 00:18:08,875
Your prime directive is to
merge with the male Type B.

388
00:18:08,958 --> 00:18:11,541
Together, you will form
a bomb and detonate.

389
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,333
That's not true.

390
00:18:22,208 --> 00:18:24,333
[RAITO] If you choose
to stay with me, however,

391
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:25,500
you can avoid that.

392
00:18:28,791 --> 00:18:29,916
[RAITO gasps]

393
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,291
[HANTA] This is where
the water plant was?

394
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,250
[RAITO]
Right.

395
00:18:48,333 --> 00:18:49,708
Construction was
behind schedule,

396
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:51,875
so the land
hadn't dried up yet.

397
00:18:51,958 --> 00:18:52,916
Pretty soon, though,

398
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,833
tons of those
will be built here.

399
00:18:54,916 --> 00:18:56,166
It's hard to believe.

400
00:18:58,333 --> 00:19:00,625
Half a decade ago,
I assumed Miss Mieko

401
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:02,541
had self-destructed.

402
00:19:02,625 --> 00:19:04,583
In reality,
she had merely sunk

403
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:07,666
to the bottom of the reservoir.

404
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:09,416
And that's where she rested.

405
00:19:10,291 --> 00:19:12,541
An acquaintance of mine
happened to work there.

406
00:19:12,625 --> 00:19:14,875
He called me when
they found her.

407
00:19:14,958 --> 00:19:16,500
It's starting
to feel like fate,

408
00:19:16,583 --> 00:19:18,125
you coming home when you did.

409
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,625
[HANTA]
I could have done something.

410
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:25,375
But instead I just stayed
hidden in the south.

411
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,333
Because that was my given order.

412
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,333
[RAITO] And in that time,
the country has rotted away.

413
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:32,541
The justice I fought
to protect was lost

414
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:35,541
alongside many young lives.

415
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:37,875
That's why I brought you here.
So you can merge.

416
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,291
The love and sense
of justice you two felt

417
00:19:41,375 --> 00:19:42,833
were manufactured.

418
00:19:42,916 --> 00:19:44,708
But I'll teach you
the real meaning of justice

419
00:19:44,791 --> 00:19:46,416
here and now, Hanta.

420
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,708
We'll open Japan's eyes.
They'll--!

421
00:19:52,916 --> 00:19:53,958
Why are you here?

422
00:19:59,916 --> 00:20:00,875
No!

423
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:06,000
You can't. Not yet.

424
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:08,250

means nothing!

If we do it there,
the government

427

will have no choice
but to--[gasps]

No! Don't let them!

said they would be,

only that they'd become
the "ultimate weapon."

The Android Megasshin.

No one else knows about
this superhuman yet.

If they infiltrate the venue,

437
00:20:55,583 --> 00:20:58,208
they can still cause enough
damage to suit my goals!

[HANTA, MIEKO]
Detective Shiba.

I cannot fulfill your command.

Why not?

441
00:21:06,208 --> 00:21:08,250
I'm the only reason
you two have been reunited

after all these years!

443
00:21:09,791 --> 00:21:11,583
[HANTA, MIEKO]
And I'm grateful for that.

444
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:15,041
However, what you're
asking me to do is evil.

445

You're nothing but a machine!

That's where you're wrong.

447
00:21:18,416 --> 00:21:19,583
They're justice.

448
00:21:19,666 --> 00:21:21,375
How can they possibly
know what that means?

449
00:21:21,458 --> 00:21:24,583
Because it was programmed
into them from the start.

450
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:25,958
To protect the country.

451
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:27,791
To save the people.

452
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,916
To be truly righteous.

453
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,791
Humans interpret these things
based on their own values,

454
00:21:32,875 --> 00:21:34,583
and thus make mistakes.

455

But machines perform flawlessly.

are you saying I'm evil?
