honored you asked me out

for drinks.

3
00:00:12,458 --> 00:00:14,125
[ULLR]
I needed a night off.

4
00:00:14,208 --> 00:00:17,208
I have to make that girl
worthy of becoming a princess.

5
00:00:17,291 --> 00:00:18,625
Oh, really?

6
00:00:18,708 --> 00:00:20,791
Jiro and the Chief are
convinced she's just a witch.

7
00:00:20,875 --> 00:00:21,625
Nothing more.

8
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:22,791
[ULLR]
Far from it.

9
00:00:22,875 --> 00:00:24,833
She's charmed many
people in this world.

10
00:00:24,916 --> 00:00:28,333
And puts them under a contract
without their knowledge.

11
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,125
That's her real power.

12
00:00:30,208 --> 00:00:32,666
[EMI] So she's not so much
a witch, but more of a--

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,916
[ULLR] Please don't say "devil."
That's such a human concept.

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,875
She's simply tasked
with becoming a ruler

15
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,208
in a different dimension.
It's not her fault.

[EMI] Let's cut to
the chase, shall we?

17
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:43,666
She's in love with Jiro.

18
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,666
And as her guardian, you can't
let that hinder your plans.

19
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:49,625
[ULLR] It could jeopardize
our true purpose.

You feel the same way?

I couldn't care less.

I just feel uncomfortable
that she's always
