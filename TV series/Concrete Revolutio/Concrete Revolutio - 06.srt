And stop puttin' things in

Otherwise, we'll show this.

Then we get as much
publicity as we want.

Hey. Where's Dee?

489
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:13,583
One more thing.

490
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:15,500
Be sure we get to keep
our pay advances.

Mr. Don!

00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,208
You guys are superhumans.

00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,416
So join us.

Let me guess: you're
recruiting superhumans

00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:43,375
to join you.

To defeat you. Yes.

So then...

00:21:47,083 --> 00:21:48,583
What answer did they give?

503
00:21:48,666 --> 00:21:51,625
They're not superhumans.
And never plan to be.

Turn it off! Turn it off!

It's too bad.

With those powers,

508
00:21:57,916 --> 00:22:00,333
and the right management,
they could do some good.

You just don't get it.
