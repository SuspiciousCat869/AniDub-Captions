Chika did her best to recruit me

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:16,625
for her school idol group.

5
00:00:16,708 --> 00:00:18,250

I'm sorry!

6
00:00:18,333 --> 00:00:19,333
[CHIKA]
Wait!

00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:20,958
[CHIKA]
Did you hear it?

8
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,125
I did.

9
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:23,750
[RIKO] Inspired by
the sounds of the ocean,

10
00:00:23,833 --> 00:00:26,625
the three of us began
writing songs together.

the more I liked the idea

[CHIKA]
I have faith!

I know in my heart that this
is the right thing to do!

17

Well?

27
00:00:57,375 --> 00:00:58,291
From what I can see,

28
00:00:58,375 --> 00:00:59,750
I definitely think
we're improving.

29
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,041
We're doing better,

30
00:01:01,125 --> 00:01:02,625
but our kicks could stand
to be a bit sharper.

31
00:01:02,708 --> 00:01:03,750
See that one there?

32
00:01:03,833 --> 00:01:05,416
Ah! I see what you mean!

33
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:07,833
[RIKO] Wow, you're so good at
catching things like that.

34
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,666
[YOU]
Thanks, I used to do high diving

35
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,541
and we analyzed form a lot.
How's our rhythm, Riko?

36
00:01:12,625 --> 00:01:15,708
[RIKO] We're mostly spot on, but
Chika, yours is a little off.

37
00:01:15,791 --> 00:01:17,833
[CHIKA]
I'm a failure!

Uh?

00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,166
[RIKO]
Relax, you're fine.

40
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:23,250
We've just gotta
keep practicing.

41
00:01:23,333 --> 00:01:24,083
Okay?

42
00:01:24,166 --> 00:01:25,666
Oh hey, an Ohara helicopter.

43
00:01:25,750 --> 00:01:26,958
Who're they?

44
00:01:27,041 --> 00:01:29,125
This rich family that runs
a hotel in Awashima.

45
00:01:29,208 --> 00:01:31,791
There's a rumor our new director
is from their family as well.

46
00:01:31,875 --> 00:01:34,208
[CHIKA]
Whoa, cool!

47
00:01:36,666 --> 00:01:38,708

Uh, is it getting closer?

48

I don't think so.

No need to be formal though!

and just call me Mari!

Uh. Why are you in a uniform?

65
00:03:42,208 --> 00:03:45,000
Do I look weird or something?
Or am I wearing it wrong?

66
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,166
Is it the ribbon?

67
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,208
Please tell me this
is the right color!

68
00:03:47,291 --> 00:03:48,791
But aren't you the new director?

69
00:03:48,875 --> 00:03:50,125
[MARI]
That's correct,

70
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,208
but I'm also a third year
student at this school!

71
00:03:52,291 --> 00:03:53,916
I'm pretty much the
best of both worlds,

72
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,875
kinda like a surf n' turf meal!

73
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,500
I don't understand
what you're saying.

74
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:58,833
[MARI]
Is not obvious to you?

75
00:03:58,916 --> 00:04:01,208
No, because you're uttering
complete nonsense!

76
00:04:01,291 --> 00:04:02,458
When did she get here?

77
00:04:02,541 --> 00:04:03,750
Oh-em-gee, Dia!

hands to yourself.

It's joke!

My goodness. When you left
during our first year

86
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,333
I thought you'd be
gone for good.

87
00:04:19,416 --> 00:04:21,000
What on earth made you
change your mind

88
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
and come back after
all this time anyway?

You could at least pretend to
listen when someone is speaking!

[laughs] It's joke.

Anyway, do you honestly expect
us to believe your tall tales?

94
00:04:33,916 --> 00:04:36,250
There's no way a third
year is our director.

95
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:39,000
How funny, that
part is not joke!

96

Didn't anyone tell you?

97
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:42,500
It just so happens my
father recently made a

98
00:04:42,583 --> 00:04:45,500
very generous donation
to this school.

99
00:04:45,583 --> 00:04:46,125
For real?

100
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,958
He did?! But why?

101
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:49,833
Like, I guess we're
charitable people!

102
00:04:49,916 --> 00:04:51,208
Also, I heard a little rumor

103
00:04:51,291 --> 00:04:53,458
Uranohoshi started a
new School Idol Club.

104
00:04:53,541 --> 00:04:55,083
Wait, you transferred
back for that?

puss and get in their way.

107
00:04:58,708 --> 00:05:00,125
So I've come to lend my support.

108
00:05:00,208 --> 00:05:01,500
Really?! Thanks a lot!

have to worry about a thing!

Wow! It's a miracle.

115
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:14,791
Or a joke!

116
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,375
If anyone needs me for anything,

117
00:05:16,458 --> 00:05:18,208

fill this place with people,

121
00:05:26,416 --> 00:05:28,000
and perform for
all those people,

122
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,250
then I'll approve the club
with the members you have.

And you'll totally
have a budget!

126
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:35,833
Great, but what happens
if we can't fill the gym?

127
00:05:35,916 --> 00:05:37,500
If you can't hold up
your end of the deal,

128
00:05:37,583 --> 00:05:38,833
you'll have to
disband your group.

129
00:05:38,916 --> 00:05:40,375
What...? We can't...

130
00:05:40,458 --> 00:05:41,708
It shouldn't be a problem

131
00:05:41,791 --> 00:05:44,250
if you're really passionate
about being an idol.

132
00:05:44,333 --> 00:05:45,333
It's up to you.

133
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:46,541
What should we do?

00:05:46,625 --> 00:05:49,125

pretty big, you know?

145

00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,375
[gasps]

147
00:06:07,458 --> 00:06:08,375
What's wrong?

148

Don't you get it?

149
00:06:09,875 --> 00:06:12,875
Even if we were to invite all
the girls at our school,

150
00:06:12,958 --> 00:06:17,625
there's not enough.
We can't fill this room.

151
00:06:17,708 --> 00:06:19,125
No way.

152
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:20,250
So now what?

153
00:06:20,333 --> 00:06:23,083
You think Mari
already knew that?

154
00:06:27,916 --> 00:06:30,208
So lame!

155
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:33,208
[RIKO] I agree but, I understand
what the director's doing.

156
00:06:33,291 --> 00:06:34,541
Don't you see?

157
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:36,625
If we can't accomplish this,
then what can we do?

158
00:06:36,708 --> 00:06:38,916
But we finally have
a song that's amazing.

159
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,583
And our choreography's
almost perfect!

Well, wanna quit then?

161
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:43,083
We're not quitting!

00:12:13,708 --> 00:12:15,500
It's possible.

323
00:12:15,583 --> 00:12:16,916
[ALL]
Hm...

324
00:12:18,583 --> 00:12:20,916
The water...

325
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,041
Guys, this is it!
This is can be our name!

326
00:12:23,125 --> 00:12:24,416
Seriously?

327
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:26,125
We don't even know who wrote
this in the first place.

328
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:27,708
That's why we should use it!

329
00:12:27,791 --> 00:12:29,708
This is like destiny
or whatever.

330
00:12:29,791 --> 00:12:31,625
'Cause we found it by accident!

331
00:12:31,708 --> 00:12:34,541
Come on, I say don't look
a gift horse in the mouth!

332
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:35,791
You've got my vote!

333
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:38,291
Fine, I agree. Not like
we had any better ideas.

334
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,625
Great! It's settled then!

335
00:12:39,708 --> 00:12:41,916
All because of this
one fateful moment.

336
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,208
Hooray! We have a name!

337
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:47,166
[GIRLS] Come see the idols of
Uranohoshi Girl's High School.

338
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,375
We are Aqours!

339
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:50,500
Hold on! We haven't
actually been approved

340
00:12:50,583 --> 00:12:52,666
as an official club
by the school yet!

341
00:12:52,750 --> 00:12:54,666
[CHIKA]
Ah... Okay then.

342
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:58,166
Come see the unofficial idols of
Uranohoshi Girl's High School.

343
00:12:58,250 --> 00:12:59,541
We're Aqours!

344
00:12:59,625 --> 00:13:01,458
And we're going to have
our very first concert

345
00:13:01,541 --> 00:13:04,458
this Saturday at two o'clock at
the high school's gymnasium!

[DIA grunts]

347
00:13:06,083 --> 00:13:07,458
[RIKO] I don't think we should
call it "unofficial" either.

348
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,958
[CHIKA] Aw jeez, well what
do you want me to call it?!

349
00:13:10,041 --> 00:13:12,375

Come see our live show.

351
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,833

Please come out
and support us!

353

[STUDENTS]
It's our turn to take a picture!

354
00:13:17,875 --> 00:13:18,583
[RIKO, CHIKA]
Uh?

355
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,541
One... two... three.

356
00:13:20,625 --> 00:13:23,000
Let's set sail for
a great adventure!

357
00:13:23,083 --> 00:13:25,166
[STUDENTS]
Aye, aye!

358
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:27,458
[CHIKA]
Wow. You sure is popular.

359
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:28,708
[RIKO chuckles]

360
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,833
Help you out?

361
00:13:29,916 --> 00:13:30,958
[CHIKA]
Mm!

362
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:31,708
Sure thing.

363
00:13:31,791 --> 00:13:32,375
Really?

364
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:33,958
Duh, of course!

365
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:39,291
[CHIKA, YOU]
Wow! It's perfect!

366
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,333
[RIKO] I think we should
revise this part.

367
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:43,458
Instead of stepping here,
wouldn't it be better

368
00:13:43,541 --> 00:13:45,541
to move like this so we
can face the audience?

369
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:48,083
[YOU] Okay, well that means
I should go around this side

370
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:49,375
before the chorus, then.

371
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:50,458
[RIKO]
Sounds good.

372
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,250
Uh, hey Chika,
what do you think?

373
00:13:56,291 --> 00:13:58,083
[RIKO]
Let's call it a night.

374
00:13:58,166 --> 00:13:59,500
[YOU]
Yeah.

375
00:13:59,583 --> 00:14:01,875
Oh my gosh, is it
that late already?

376
00:14:01,958 --> 00:14:03,791
None of the buses
are running anymore!

377
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:04,625
[RIKO]
What?!

378
00:14:04,708 --> 00:14:05,750
[MITO]
Hm?

379
00:14:11,041 --> 00:14:12,333
Is everything all right?

380
00:14:12,416 --> 00:14:15,041
Yes. They told me to keep
better track of time

381
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,458
and don't let it happen again.

382
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:18,458
Okay. You're really into this!

383
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:19,375
Huh?

384
00:14:19,458 --> 00:14:20,625
[SHIMA]
Honestly, I'm surprised

385
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,708
to see Chika so
wrapped up in it.

386
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,875
Uh, why's that?

387
00:14:23,958 --> 00:14:26,041
She starts off all excited
about something,

388
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:27,833
but usually loses
interest pretty fast.

389
00:14:27,916 --> 00:14:29,500
I don't think she
loses interest.

390
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,000
She just doesn't commit
to stuff half-heartedly.

391
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:34,541
Chika's gonna give this
everything she's got.

392
00:14:34,625 --> 00:14:36,541
That's just how she is.

393
00:14:36,625 --> 00:14:38,791
I see. You're the expert!

394
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:40,291
[laughs]

395
00:14:40,375 --> 00:14:43,083
Anyway, do you think the
show will go smoothly?

396
00:14:43,166 --> 00:14:45,125
It's coming up!

397
00:14:48,250 --> 00:14:51,291
I really hope so.

398
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:53,291
A full house, though?

399
00:14:53,375 --> 00:14:54,541
[YOU]
I'm nervous,

400
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:57,208
since there aren't a lot
of people around here.

401
00:14:58,833 --> 00:14:59,750
[SHIMA]
Don't worry.

402
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,000

Huh?

403
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:01,916
Have faith.

404
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,291
It's a good community.

00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:18,833
[RIKO]
Are you sure about this?

406
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,416
I'm really worried
my skirt is too short.

407
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,958
[CHIKA]
Of course I'm sure!

408
00:15:23,041 --> 00:15:25,958
Look at the costumes Mu's wore
during their first concert!

409
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,541
You look great!

410
00:15:27,625 --> 00:15:31,125
[RIKO] Uh. Maybe I'm not cut out
to be a school idol after all.

411
00:15:31,208 --> 00:15:32,625
[CHIKA]
It'll be fine!

412
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,541
Once you're on stage you
won't even think about it.

413
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:37,125
[YOU]
It's almost time, girls!

414
00:15:37,208 --> 00:15:39,291
What exactly do we do again?

415
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:42,333
[CHIKA] Uh, we put our hands
in the middle like this.

416
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:44,375
Wanna hold hands?

417

Huh?

418
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,333
Come on, just try it with me.
I think it will work better.

419
00:15:48,416 --> 00:15:49,416

420
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,000
It feels nice and warm.

will affect our turnout.

if nobody shows up?

disband like Mari said.

to believe in your dreams.

That's why we became
school idols.

To inspire others.
