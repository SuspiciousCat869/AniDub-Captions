00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:12,750
[KANAN]
Previously on,

00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:14,041
[GIRLS]
<i>"Love Live! Sunshine!!"</i>

3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:15,083
[CHIKA]
Aqours!

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:16,291
[KANAN]
We managed to break through

5
00:00:16,375 --> 00:00:17,833
the prelims of Love Live.

6
00:00:17,916 --> 00:00:18,875
[CHIKA]
Zero.

7
00:00:18,958 --> 00:00:20,250
[YOU]
Tokyo?

8
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,041
[KANAN] But with no new
applicants, we went to Tokyo

9
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,416
to find out how Mu's
saved their school.

10
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,625
[CHIKA] And they
were so wonderful,

11
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,583
'cause they did a
brand new thing.

12
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,416
They weren't afraid
to pave the way.

13
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:33,291
Mu's worked hard to make
their dreams a reality.

14
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,166
They were free,
and true to themselves.

15
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,708
[KANAN] So now, we'll work
hard toward our new goal

16
00:00:38,791 --> 00:00:41,458
of turning that zero into a one!

17
00:00:47,666 --> 00:00:49,875
Hello everybody!
Nice to meet you.

18
00:00:49,958 --> 00:00:52,666
We're idols of Uranohoshi
Girl's High School!

19
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:54,916
[ALL]
We are Aqours!

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,875
[CHIKA] Today, we have something
very special to share with you.

21
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:01,791
And that is...

22
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:36,041
[KANAN]
One, two, three, four...

23
00:02:36,125 --> 00:02:38,333
One, two, three, four...

24
00:02:38,416 --> 00:02:40,666
Try and speed up your movement
right there, Ruby.

25
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:41,875
[RUBY]
Uh, 'Kay!

26
00:02:41,958 --> 00:02:43,125
[KANAN]
Oh, and Yoshiko.

27
00:02:43,208 --> 00:02:44,375
[YOSHIKO]
Yohane!

28
00:02:44,458 --> 00:02:46,500
[KANAN laughs]
You need to speed up a bit, too.

29
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,291
[YOSHIKO]
Understood! Teleportation mode!

30
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:50,250
[KANAN]
Good!

31
00:02:50,333 --> 00:02:52,750
Let's take five everyone!

32
00:02:52,833 --> 00:02:54,666
[ALL sigh]

33
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:56,416
It's too dang hot today, zura!

34
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,208
Feels like I'm melting
into a Ruby puddle!

35
00:02:59,291 --> 00:03:00,708
[YOU]
Here!

36
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:03,333
On hot days like this, it's
important to stay hydrated!

37
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:04,625
Okay, got it!

38
00:03:04,708 --> 00:03:06,208
Thank you!

39
00:03:07,458 --> 00:03:10,416
[exhales] It's a gorgeous day!

40
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,500
Yes, but you should
take a break as well.

41
00:03:12,583 --> 00:03:15,791
Too much time in the sun can
wreak havoc on your complexion.

42
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:20,625
Not Kanan! She loves the
sun and it loves her back!

43
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,416
[groaning]

44
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,041
[ALL gasp]

45
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,125
I tried to warn you that
wearing black in this heat

46
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:26,541
was a poor choice.

47
00:03:26,625 --> 00:03:28,791
Foolish mortal! You
would never understand!

48
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,666
Black is a fundamental for
a fallen angel's identify!

49
00:03:31,750 --> 00:03:34,166
[DIA]
As is heatstroke, apparently.

50
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,333
Heads up Chika!

51
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,916
Special delivery!

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,291
Nice catch!

53
00:03:40,375 --> 00:03:42,416
Thanks ladies!

54
00:03:43,125 --> 00:03:47,875
[CHIKA laughs] This is awesome;
things are starting to heat up.

55
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,750
Let's keep doing our best!

56
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,166
Aye aye ma'am!

57
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:55,500
Okay then! Who's ready
to get back to work?

58
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:56,875
Boop! Boop!

59
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,250
What?!

60
00:03:58,333 --> 00:04:00,833
[DIA] Overworking ourselves
is against club rules!

61
00:04:00,916 --> 00:04:04,500
Says Kanan! She's the
expert on exercise!

62
00:04:04,583 --> 00:04:05,875
That's true,

63
00:04:05,958 --> 00:04:08,166
and I guess the hottest part
of the day is coming up.

64
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,375
[DIA]
I understand you're worried

65
00:04:09,458 --> 00:04:11,208
since the regional
qualifiers for Love Live

66
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:12,791
are right around the corner,

67
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:15,208
but it's equally important to
give your body a proper rest.

68
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,833
[RUBY]
You're so smart, Sis!

69
00:04:16,916 --> 00:04:18,416
[KANAN]
Before we do anything else,

70
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:21,000
everyone needs to
pitch in some cash!

71
00:04:21,083 --> 00:04:23,041
[YOSHIKO]
The time has come again.

72
00:04:23,125 --> 00:04:25,458
It's the ultimate
daily challenge.

73
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:29,458
[chuckles] Today I will not
descend to Ragnarok.

74
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:31,208
I will... prevail!

75
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,708
[KANAN]
Get ready.

76
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:34,875
One... two...

77
00:04:36,333 --> 00:04:38,333
[YOSHIKO]
How do I always lose?

78
00:04:38,416 --> 00:04:40,583
I'm afraid you're
just few yen short.

79
00:04:40,666 --> 00:04:43,875
Which one of you got the
expensive ice cream?!

80
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:45,041
Zura.

81
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:46,041
Ruby.

82
00:04:46,125 --> 00:04:47,583
Yoha.

83
00:04:47,666 --> 00:04:49,958
You know the rest of us would
enjoy some cold air as well.

84
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:53,000
I don't understand why the
classrooms don't have AC.

85
00:04:53,083 --> 00:04:55,333
[RIKO] The school wouldn't
invest in something so expensive

86
00:04:55,416 --> 00:04:56,958
when it's about to be shut down.

87
00:04:57,041 --> 00:04:58,166
[CHIKA]
I guess so.

88
00:04:58,250 --> 00:04:59,791
Oh yeah, that reminds me!

89
00:04:59,875 --> 00:05:03,041
Would someone check and see
if there's any new applicants.

90
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:04,083
[MARI grunts]

91
00:05:04,166 --> 00:05:05,583
[DIA]
Mari! That's so un ladylike!

92
00:05:05,666 --> 00:05:08,041
According to the website...

93
00:05:08,125 --> 00:05:10,000
According to the website?

94
00:05:10,083 --> 00:05:11,750
[MARI]
According to the website...

95
00:05:11,833 --> 00:05:14,958
According to the website...?

96
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:16,791
Zero!

97
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:21,583
[CHIKA groans] I don't get it,
why isn't anyone signing up?

98
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:25,166
Our school can't possibly
be that boring.

99
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:25,833
[door opens]

100
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:26,500
[YOU]
Mm?

101
00:05:26,583 --> 00:05:27,875
[CHIKA]
Huh?

102
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:28,958
Hello?

103
00:05:29,041 --> 00:05:31,500
[CHIKA]
Hi, Mutsu! What are you up to?

104
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:34,250
Oh. We were just here
to return some books

105
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,375
What about you?
More idol practice?

106
00:05:36,458 --> 00:05:38,500
Yep! The regional
qualifiers are soon.

107
00:05:38,583 --> 00:05:40,166
You work out in this heat?

108
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:44,125
It's not so bad. We practice
every day, so we're used to it.

109
00:05:44,208 --> 00:05:45,375
Whoa, for real?

110
00:05:45,458 --> 00:05:47,000
Every single day?

111
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,708
Even though it's
summer vacation?

112
00:05:48,791 --> 00:05:50,083
[CHIKA]
Mm-hm!

113
00:05:50,166 --> 00:05:52,333
[KANAN]
Hey, time to go back up, Chika!

114
00:05:52,416 --> 00:05:55,750
'Kay! Bye girls!

115
00:05:55,833 --> 00:05:59,000
See ya later.

116
00:05:59,083 --> 00:06:01,500
That's crazy, they
practice every day?

117
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,458
It's pretty amazing that
they're doing all this

118
00:06:03,541 --> 00:06:06,041
just to keep our school
from closing down.

119
00:06:06,125 --> 00:06:07,000
Yeah.

120
00:06:07,083 --> 00:06:08,083
[MUTSU]
You know what though?

121
00:06:08,166 --> 00:06:09,500
They're really sparkling!

122
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:10,958
[ITSUKO]
They're inspiring!

123
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,583
[YOSHIMI]
For sure!

124
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:19,125
[sighs] Another day
of practice down!

125
00:06:19,208 --> 00:06:22,125
Yeah, but I can tell we're
really improving!

126
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,500
Hey, Riko. Any updates
on the new song?

127
00:06:24,583 --> 00:06:26,875
Hanamaru and are I
fine tuning the lyrics,

128
00:06:26,958 --> 00:06:29,125
and Kanan is choreographing
the dance.

129
00:06:29,208 --> 00:06:31,125
I can't wait to perform
it on stage,

130
00:06:31,208 --> 00:06:32,958
we're going to be
totally <i>brillante</i> !

131
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:34,541
[KANAN]
We worked really hard today.

132
00:06:34,625 --> 00:06:37,333
I say we reward ourselves
with a swimming break!

133
00:06:37,416 --> 00:06:38,375
[splashing]

134
00:06:38,458 --> 00:06:39,083
[DIA]
Not again!

135
00:06:39,166 --> 00:06:42,000
[GIRLS chattering]

136
00:06:42,083 --> 00:06:44,375
[KANAN]
Come on in, the water's great!

137
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:45,791
[gasps]

138
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:51,833
[MUTSU]
Ah, there they are!

139
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,666
Hey Chika!

140
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:57,458
[CHIKA] Oh, hi Mutsu!
I thought you went home already.

141
00:06:57,541 --> 00:06:59,458
Well, not yet.

142
00:06:59,541 --> 00:07:01,958
We actually wanted to
ask you a little question.

143
00:07:02,041 --> 00:07:03,208
[CHIKA]
Yeah?

144
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,250
It's just that... You've
spent your whole summer

145
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,416
practicing for Love Live
regionals, right?

146
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,666
So we wondered if being a school
idol is as fun as it looks.

147
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:14,833
It sounds silly, but we kinda
thought maybe we could try

148
00:07:14,916 --> 00:07:18,291
and become school idols too,
and help save the school.

149
00:07:18,375 --> 00:07:21,000
[ITSUKO] And we're not the only
ones, there are tons of students

150
00:07:21,083 --> 00:07:23,250
at our school who feel exactly
the same as we do!

151
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:25,000
We all just wanna help out!

152
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:26,708
You really feel that way?

153
00:07:26,791 --> 00:07:28,166
Yes!

154
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:29,916
They're going to combine and
shut us down, aren't they?

155
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,250
We love this place too,
but we're just kids,

156
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:34,333
we never imagined we might
be able to save it.

157
00:07:34,416 --> 00:07:38,083
Exactly! That's why seeing all
your hard work is so inspiring!

158
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:39,416
Let us help you!

159
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:41,708
We all want the same thing,
to save our school,

160
00:07:41,791 --> 00:07:45,375
to sparkle and shine, the
same way that you girls do!

161
00:07:45,458 --> 00:07:47,083
Uranohoshi is special to us,

162
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,750
and we'll do whatever it
takes to keep it open!

163
00:07:49,833 --> 00:07:52,041
[CHIKA cries]

164
00:07:52,125 --> 00:07:54,125
Well, Chika?

165
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,083
What do you say?

166
00:07:58,583 --> 00:08:01,083
Okay! We'll do it together!

167
00:08:01,166 --> 00:08:01,916
[YOSHIMI]
For real?!

168
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:02,625
[CHIKA]
Yeah!

169
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,041
[MUTSU]
Thank you!

170
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,916
[YOU] This is pretty
exciting stuff, huh?

171
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,708
[CHIKA laughs]
I can't wait for Love Live!

172
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,875
It's gonna rock!

173
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,458
[RIKO]
Just the song?

174
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:14,666
[CHIKA] Yeah! I know they don't
have time to learn the dance,

175
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:16,458
but I figure they could
at least learn the song

176
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,583
and maybe sing with
us up on stage.

177
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,083
Think they can do it?

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,500
Yep!

179
00:08:21,583 --> 00:08:24,125
We're gonna sound so awesome,
all singing together!

180
00:08:24,208 --> 00:08:25,500
We'll get super famous,

181
00:08:25,583 --> 00:08:27,583
and then the school will get
a ton of new applicants.

182
00:08:27,666 --> 00:08:29,833
They'll have no choice
but to keep us open!

183
00:08:29,916 --> 00:08:31,500
It's possible, but still...

184
00:08:31,583 --> 00:08:33,208
[CHIKA]
Right now,

185
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:38,000
I wanna turn that
zero into a one.

186
00:08:38,083 --> 00:08:41,625
Today, when I was talking
to Mutsu and the others,

187
00:08:41,708 --> 00:08:45,125
I thought about why our
school has zero applicants.

188
00:08:45,208 --> 00:08:47,291
I mean, Uranohoshi
is so much fun

189
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:49,541
and everyone always
looks super happy.

190
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:51,416
It's not just the school either,

191
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,125
our town can also
be very charming.

192
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,791
I feel like that must mean that
this is a wonderful place,

193
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:58,666
you know?

194
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:00,375
We may have zero applicants,

195
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,916
but only 'cause they
don't understand

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,750
how awesome our school is yet!

197
00:09:04,833 --> 00:09:07,833
It's not like I don't care about
Love Live, because I do.

198
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:10,708
I just want everyone to see
this place through our eyes.

199
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:15,125
And... And I think we
can totally do that!

200
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:21,833
[RIKO gasps]
Whoa, Chika!

201
00:09:21,916 --> 00:09:23,625
Behind you!

202
00:09:23,708 --> 00:09:27,166
There's like a ghost!
Or spirit! I'm not sure!

203
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:29,541
[gasps] Mom!
What are you doing here?

204
00:09:29,625 --> 00:09:32,625
Did you say your mom?
Is she a ghost?!

205
00:09:32,708 --> 00:09:36,083
Oh my! Yes, I'm Chika's mother,
but I'm not a ghost!

206
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,833
You must be our
new neighbor, then!

207
00:09:37,916 --> 00:09:40,416
Right, of course!
I'm terribly sorry.

208
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,583
Nice to meet you!

209
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:42,833
No worries, dear!

210
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:45,041
Nice to meet you too,
and aren't you pretty?

211
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:47,791
Oh... Me? That's
kind of you to say!

212
00:09:47,875 --> 00:09:49,125
And also true.

213
00:09:49,208 --> 00:09:50,250
[CHIKA]
Mm...

214
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,333
Hold up, you never
answered me earlier!

215
00:09:52,416 --> 00:09:54,458
Aren't you supposed
to be in Tokyo?

216
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:55,833
Yes, well I was,

217
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:59,041
until Shima told me you were
in the School Idols Club

218
00:09:59,125 --> 00:10:00,416
and I should come back
to see you perform.

219
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,833
Something to that effect
anyway, so here I am!

220
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,666
Shima should mind
her own business!

221
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,083
But anyway, Mother,

222
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:08,375
I've got some important stuff
to talk about with Riko,

223
00:10:08,458 --> 00:10:10,458
so can you please just
give us some space?

224
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,250
Fine, fine. I'll see myself out.

225
00:10:13,333 --> 00:10:15,125
Ah, one question though.

226
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:16,791
Yeah, what?

227
00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,500
Will you give up? Or stay true?

228
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,041
I won't give up!

229
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:32,000
Your mom is kinda cool.

230
00:10:32,083 --> 00:10:34,666
[CHIKA]
What? That's just crazy!

231
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:37,750
But enough about her,
let's get back to Love Live!

232
00:10:37,833 --> 00:10:39,625
Right!

233
00:10:39,708 --> 00:10:42,541
[GIRLS]
Love Live! Sunshine!!

00:10:49,625 --> 00:10:50,708
Is it?

237
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:53,625
My new domain awaits.
Yohane's arrived!

238
00:10:53,708 --> 00:10:56,166
[CHIKA] They're asking where
we're supposed to meet?

239
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,583
Did we come from over there?

240
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,458
Or was it over there?

241
00:10:59,541 --> 00:11:00,958
[ALL sigh]

242
00:11:01,041 --> 00:11:03,416
[YOU] I wonder where Mutsu
and the others could be?

243
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:06,500
I'm positive I said to
meet us here. I think.

244
00:11:06,583 --> 00:11:07,333
[MUTSU]
Chika!

Ah! There!

So glad you made it!

[MUTSU]
I'm so sorry!

00:11:12,791 --> 00:11:15,125
We had a little
trouble finding you.

250

Where's everyone else?

--'Bout that...
--Yeah.

We wanted to tell you
before now, the thing is...

00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:22,708
No problem!

254
00:11:22,791 --> 00:11:25,416
We understand, it's okay.
It is summer vacation.

255
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,250
[MUTSU] We really did tell
everyone at school.

256
00:11:27,333 --> 00:11:28,458
[CHIKA]
Huh, uh?

257
00:11:28,541 --> 00:11:31,208
It's true, we tried our best.

258
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:32,458
Uh, what?

259
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,083
All right! Is everybody
ready to go?

260
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,166
[URANOHOSHI STUDENTS]
Yeah!

[AQOURS] They're all here!
Everyone's joining in!

262
00:11:41,916 --> 00:11:43,208
Awesome.

263
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,833
Did we surprise you?

264
00:11:44,916 --> 00:11:47,333
Yeah! If we all sing
on stage together,

265
00:11:47,416 --> 00:11:49,500
I know that we'll
shine super bright!

266
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:51,458
We'll show how great
our school can be!

267
00:11:51,541 --> 00:11:53,875
[RIKO]
Wait, I'm sorry!

268
00:11:53,958 --> 00:11:57,166
[CHIKA]
Huh? What for?

269
00:11:59,291 --> 00:12:00,583
[RIKO]
The thing is...

270
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:02,625
I looked it up and there's
a rule which states

271
00:12:02,708 --> 00:12:04,291
the only people
allowed to sing

272
00:12:04,375 --> 00:12:06,208
are those who
applied beforehand.

273
00:12:06,291 --> 00:12:07,708
[CHIKA]
Oh, no.

274
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:08,958
[RIKO]
On top of that,

275
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:11,625
they're not even allowed
to be near the stage.

276
00:12:11,708 --> 00:12:14,333
I should have said
something sooner.

277
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,666
[CHIKA]
I'm so sorry, everyone!

[MUTSU]
Hey, it's not your fault!

279
00:12:17,208 --> 00:12:19,541
I mean, we didn't really
give you much warning.

280
00:12:19,625 --> 00:12:22,041
[YOSHIMI] Yeah, it's fine!
Think of it this way,

281
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,000
you'll have a super huge
cheering section!

282
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:26,291
[MUTSU] And you can bet we're
gonna be loud and proud!

and give it your best!

can't believe we're really here.

Me neither, zura.

287
00:12:40,125 --> 00:12:43,041
I never imagined we'd
actually make it this far.

288
00:12:43,125 --> 00:12:44,833
Feels like I'm dreamin'!

It's not that hard to believe!

This is real. This is happening.

Now! All that's left is
to become school idols,

294
00:12:57,500 --> 00:12:59,500
and descend upon
the stage together!

with anyone else!

[KANAN] Wow, we finally made
it after all this time,

300
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:14,916
and as third years nonetheless.

301
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,583
[DIA]
It does seem surreal,

302
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:19,416
and it's all because of someone
who was very stubborn.

303
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:24,166
Yeah, true. We never
thank her, so thanks.

But I'm the one that should
be thanking you girls.

You're both the reason
I became a school idol

in the first place.

307
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:33,500
And we're here now because
you decided to wait for me.

I love you both so much.

I never could have imagined

what kind of life
was waiting for me.

Captain Chika for that!

of me, you also have to thank

00:13:58,125 --> 00:14:00,291
Love Live, and thank
Mu's as well!

318
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,083
And school idols everywhere.

319
00:14:02,166 --> 00:14:06,333
Besides, both of you
played a part too!

320
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:09,083
A lot of things are
going to come our way.

321
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:12,625
It won't always
be easy. In fact,

322
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:15,416
I'm sure there will be
a lot of obstacles.

323
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:20,416
But I'm going to enjoy
every single second of it.

324
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,250
I'll treasure this time,

325
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:24,916
and savor each special moment.

326
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:30,083
Because together... together
is how we'll truly shine!

327
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:32,000
[DIA]
Well said.

328
00:14:32,083 --> 00:14:35,833
The nine of us will sparkle.

329
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,875
[CHIKA]
There's more than just nine.

330
00:14:37,958 --> 00:14:39,916
Let's go!

331
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:48,458
[CHIKA] Today, we have
something very special to share

332
00:14:48,541 --> 00:14:53,333
with you, and that is the story
of a little town called Uchiura,

333
00:14:53,416 --> 00:14:56,500
and the school in it!

334
00:14:56,583 --> 00:14:58,416
Here is where Aqours was born.

335
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:01,500
Here, the ocean's big,
and it kisses the shoreline.

336
00:15:01,583 --> 00:15:04,166
Here the sun always
shines bright!

337
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:06,958
Our town's small, and
there aren't many people.

338
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:09,833
But there's plenty of fish
and tons of oranges,

339
00:15:09,916 --> 00:15:12,625
probably more than you
could ever even eat!

340
00:15:12,708 --> 00:15:16,083
Everyone who lives there
is super friendly.

341
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,458
In this town, there's also
what you might consider

342
00:15:18,541 --> 00:15:22,375
a small high school.
All of its students are here!

343
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:25,208
Cheering us on!

344
00:15:25,291 --> 00:15:26,916
Not too long ago,

345
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,291
we decided to start
a School Idol Club.

346
00:15:31,375 --> 00:15:34,500
In Akiba, we saw Mu's
for the very first time.

347
00:15:34,583 --> 00:15:38,708
We wanted shine like
they did, except...

348
00:15:38,791 --> 00:15:41,416
[BOTH]
Wait, compose?

349
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:42,666
That's right!

350
00:15:42,750 --> 00:15:45,208
You have to be able to
write your own songs!

351
00:15:45,291 --> 00:15:48,500
It's in the Love Live rules.
Otherwise you'll fail!

352
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:50,500
[BOTH]
An obstacle!

353
00:15:50,583 --> 00:15:53,541
Luckily enough, we got
a new transfer student.

354
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,791
Riko could play piano
and write songs!

355
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:58,458
It's a miracle!

356
00:15:58,541 --> 00:15:59,750
[RIKO]
I'm so sorry!

357
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,958
[BOTH]
What?!

358
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,500
[STUDENTS laughing]

359
00:16:02,583 --> 00:16:04,958
[CHIKA] Riko had just moved
to our little town from Tokyo,

360
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:06,500
and wasn't really
that interested

361
00:16:06,583 --> 00:16:08,375
in school idols at first.

362
00:16:08,458 --> 00:16:11,708
She had her own problems
to deal with.

363
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,208
[CHIKA, YOU]
But then...

364
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:15,416
I want to shine!

365
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,333
[YOU] That's how Riko
became the third member

366
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:18,750
of our budding
school idol group!

367
00:16:18,833 --> 00:16:20,458
Next up!

368
00:16:20,541 --> 00:16:26,708
Oh, hi there! I wanna join,
but I'm not very athletic, zura.

369
00:16:26,791 --> 00:16:28,083
And me?

370
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:32,125
I'd love to be a school idol,
but I'm way too shy.

371
00:16:32,208 --> 00:16:32,791
[STUDENTS gasp]

372
00:16:32,875 --> 00:16:34,333
I am called Yohane!

373
00:16:34,416 --> 00:16:37,208
I have descended
from the heavens!

374
00:16:37,291 --> 00:16:41,583
I wish to spread my wings in a
place where I can be truly free!

375
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,583
After our numbers
had grown to six,

376
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:47,333
we decided to make a promo
video about our town,

377
00:16:47,416 --> 00:16:49,666
and our wonderful community.

378
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,041
Before we knew it,

379
00:16:51,125 --> 00:16:54,166
we'd been invited to perform
at an event in Tokyo!

380
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:55,083
The future, zura!

381
00:16:55,166 --> 00:16:56,125
Look at all the people!

382
00:16:56,208 --> 00:16:59,000
Some know it as the city of sin!

383
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:01,250
This is where we're singing!

384
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:03,375
Let's do this!

385
00:17:03,458 --> 00:17:06,583
We lost? There's no way!

386
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:10,625
[CHIKA]
We came in last.

387
00:17:10,708 --> 00:17:12,958
Wanna know how many
votes we received?

388
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:14,250
Zero.

389
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,458
[RIKO]
Zero.

390
00:17:15,541 --> 00:17:16,500
[YOU]
Zero.

391
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:17,250
[YOSHIKO]
Zero.

392
00:17:17,333 --> 00:17:17,958
[RUBY]
Zero.

393
00:17:18,041 --> 00:17:19,541
[HANAMARU]
Zero.

394
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,166
[CHIKA]
Zero...

395
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,416
Being a school idol
is really kinda tough.

396
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,541
It was definitely harder
than we thought it would be.

397
00:17:30,625 --> 00:17:33,708
You give up?

398
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:38,416
Hey Chika? Should we give up?

399
00:17:38,500 --> 00:17:40,250
[CHIKA]
It was frustrating!

400
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:42,541
It was really frustrating!

401
00:17:42,625 --> 00:17:46,833
We had worked hard,
but it wasn't enough!

402
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:50,583
We got zero votes!
Why? We deserved more!

403
00:17:50,666 --> 00:17:54,291
[RIKO] On that day, we all
decided on a new goal together.

404
00:17:54,375 --> 00:17:56,500
Turn that zero into a one.

405
00:17:56,583 --> 00:17:58,875
That's right! We can't
let it end with a zero.

406
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,625
So we'll just have
to keep trying.

407
00:18:00,708 --> 00:18:03,916
If we work hard, I'm sure
that zero will become a one!

408
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,125
Together, we decided
to carry on!

409
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:07,708
[RIKO]
Then our group grew yet again,

410
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,833
as we found some new allies!

411
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,750
I'm Uranohoshi's student
council president, Dia!

412
00:18:12,833 --> 00:18:15,625
I guess if you're joining
the idols, I will too!

413
00:18:15,708 --> 00:18:17,791
<i>Ciao bellas</i> , I'm Mari!

414
00:18:17,875 --> 00:18:20,333
These three former idols
joined hands again,

415
00:18:20,416 --> 00:18:22,250
and became part of our group.

416
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:25,791
With all nine members,
Aqours was finally perfect!

417
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,708
And so we entered
the Love Live prelims

418
00:18:27,791 --> 00:18:31,333
and passed with flying colors!
We were all really happy!

419
00:18:31,416 --> 00:18:32,375
And yet...

420
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,375
We had no new applicants.

421
00:18:34,458 --> 00:18:37,041
Our old foe was back again.

422
00:18:37,125 --> 00:18:39,916
That pesky zero clung to us
like a wet towel, zura!

423
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,125
Why?!

424
00:18:44,208 --> 00:18:46,500
[KANAN] We thought about
our problem a lot.

425
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,083
We thought about how
we could move forward.

426
00:18:49,166 --> 00:18:52,458
We thought of ways to change
that zero into a one.

427
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,333
And together,
we made a decision.

428
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:57,958
What we decided...

429
00:18:58,041 --> 00:18:59,333
...was with our town....

430
00:18:59,416 --> 00:19:01,083
...and with our school.

431
00:19:01,166 --> 00:19:03,083
And of course,
with all our friends.

432
00:19:03,166 --> 00:19:06,541
At last, we would
follow our own path!

433
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,708
Accepting whatever came our way.

434
00:19:08,791 --> 00:19:10,750
[DIA] We'd treasure
every precious moment.

[MARI] Because that's
what it means to shine!

436
00:19:15,666 --> 00:19:17,166
We'll enjoy life,

and shine bright!

[CHIKA] You might be wondering
what exactly we managed

461
00:23:06,666 --> 00:23:08,666
to make out of that zero.

462
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:11,416

like an impossible dream.

But when things seemed
their darkest,

we found a light
shining inside of us.

It was the belief
that the nine of us

could do something
truly amazing.
