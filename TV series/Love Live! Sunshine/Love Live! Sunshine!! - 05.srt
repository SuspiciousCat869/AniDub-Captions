Previously on,

00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:13,958
[GIRLS]
<i>Love Live! Sunshine!!</i>

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,583
[RUBY]
Chika invited me and Hanamaru

4
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,583
to join the newly approved
School Idol Club.

5
00:00:17,666 --> 00:00:20,000
[CHIKA] I know you two would
shine so bright on stage!

6
00:00:20,083 --> 00:00:21,375
[RUBY]
I really wanted to do it,

7
00:00:21,458 --> 00:00:23,458
but I was worried about what
my sister would think.

8
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:24,875
Then Hanamaru told me...

9
00:00:24,958 --> 00:00:27,458
[HANAMARU] Isn't that something
you'd really like?

10
00:00:27,541 --> 00:00:28,583
In that case,

11
00:00:28,666 --> 00:00:30,458
this is your chance to shine!

12
00:00:30,541 --> 00:00:32,666
[RUBY] So I joined!
And Hanamaru did, too!

13
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:35,166
[CHIKA] Nobody really knows if
they can or can't do something

14
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:38,083
they like. Where's the fun
if you don't try though?

15
00:00:38,166 --> 00:00:39,208
[RUBY]
And just like that,

16
00:00:39,291 --> 00:00:41,708
Aqours had five members!

17
00:00:42,375 --> 00:00:43,833
[YOSHIKO]
I feel it.

18
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:47,041
There's a rift in the spiritual
barriers between our worlds.

19
00:00:47,125 --> 00:00:49,666
The magical balance
has been altered.

20
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:52,166
The fate of this humble
planet now depends on

21
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,708
a divine decision from
the heavens above.

22
00:00:54,791 --> 00:00:57,083
Now behold the Fallen
Angel, Yohane,

23
00:00:57,166 --> 00:01:00,958
descended to this dark world to
foresee all, the chosen vessel!

24
00:01:01,041 --> 00:01:03,500
Come and join the
ranks of my demons!

25
00:01:03,583 --> 00:01:06,291
Gain true power!

26
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:13,833
[YOSHIKO chuckles]
Yes, I did it, hooray!

27
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:15,541
What's with Yohane?!

28
00:01:15,625 --> 00:01:17,250
Who is this fallen angel?!

29
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:19,083
What about her demon followers?!

30
00:01:19,166 --> 00:01:21,041
Do those things really exist?!

31
00:01:21,125 --> 00:01:23,000
Yeah, right!

32
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:25,333
[YOSHIKO panting]
Oh, get it together, Yoshiko!

33
00:01:25,416 --> 00:01:26,750
You're in high school now!

34
00:01:26,833 --> 00:01:28,625
You're way too old
for this nonsense.

35
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,083
But your only alternative
is facing reality.

36
00:01:31,166 --> 00:01:33,500
Can you shoulder a
burden that heavy?

37
00:01:33,583 --> 00:01:34,958
Yes, of course!

38
00:01:35,041 --> 00:01:37,041
I can handle anything!

39
00:01:37,125 --> 00:01:39,666
To those of you clinging
to your weak mortal coils,

40
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,416
Yohane offers the deal
of a lifetime.

41
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:45,250
As my demons. Heh, heh.

42
00:01:45,916 --> 00:01:49,458
[YOSHIKO cries] I can't believe
I actually said that!

43
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:51,916
I'm never going back to school!

44
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:26,375
[YOU] Oh... We've barely
moved up at all!

45
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,166
[RIKO] Come on, it's
better than yesterday

46
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,750
when we were
in 4,856th place.

47
00:03:31,833 --> 00:03:32,833
[YOU]
I guess.

48
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,750
At least we're not
dropping in rank.

49
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,250
From what I saw online, our
songs are getting good reviews.

50
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,500
Not to mention, people think
our two newest members

51
00:03:39,583 --> 00:03:40,333
are beyond cute!

52
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,625
Does it really say that?!

53
00:03:41,708 --> 00:03:42,875
You betcha!

54
00:03:42,958 --> 00:03:44,875
And it seems Hanamaru
is especially popular.

55
00:03:44,958 --> 00:03:47,625
[RIKO] Yeah, "I'll be
cheering for Hanamaru."

56
00:03:47,708 --> 00:03:49,708
[YOU] "I hope she sings
as pretty as she looks.

57
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:50,750
Can't wait to hear!"

58
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:51,666
[CHIKA]
See? See?

59
00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:53,041
You guys are a hit!

60
00:03:53,125 --> 00:03:55,291
Wait! So this thing's
a computer?

61
00:03:55,375 --> 00:03:55,916
For real?!

62
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,291
I read about this.

63
00:03:57,375 --> 00:03:59,791
is it true you can connect
to the internet and then

64
00:03:59,875 --> 00:04:02,708
gain access to an entire
sea of knowledge?

65
00:04:02,791 --> 00:04:04,083
Yeah, it's true.

66
00:04:04,166 --> 00:04:06,458
Except it's more like a sea
of adorable cat videos.

67
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:07,916
Wow!

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,333
[RUBY laughs]

69
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:11,375
Okay, has she seriously never
seen a computer before?

70
00:04:11,458 --> 00:04:13,875
Actually, she lives in
this super ancient temple

71
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,125
and they're kinda lacking
in technological stuff.

72
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:17,375
That makes sense.

73
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:20,708
You should have seen her
at Numazu the other day.

74
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:22,291
Whoa.

75
00:04:22,375 --> 00:04:24,750
How in the heck are you supposed
to turn on this faucet, zura?

76
00:04:24,833 --> 00:04:26,708
[gasping]

77
00:04:26,791 --> 00:04:28,250
It's the future!

78
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:31,541
Ruby, it's the future!
I love Numazu!

79
00:04:31,625 --> 00:04:32,416
Yeah...

80
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,791
Can I please touch it?

81
00:04:33,875 --> 00:04:34,750
[CHIKA]
Uh, sure.

82
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:37,375
[gasping]

83
00:04:42,291 --> 00:04:44,458
Huh?

84
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,583
Zura!

85
00:04:45,666 --> 00:04:46,791
[ALL gasping]

86
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:48,708
Wait. What button did
you press just now?

87
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,916
Oh, ah...

88
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,333
Well, there was one that
was glowin' really brightly

89
00:04:54,416 --> 00:04:55,916
so I kinda sorta pushed it.

90
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,250
You, Is it okay?

91
00:04:57,333 --> 00:04:59,458
[YOU] I hope I saved the file
for our costumes!

92
00:04:59,541 --> 00:05:01,500
[HANAMARU]
Uh, sorry.

93
00:05:01,583 --> 00:05:04,166
It was an accident! I didn't
mean to mess it all up.

94
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,750
[laughs] Don't worry,
it'll be okay.

95
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:08,208
[HANAMARU whimpers]

96
00:05:08,875 --> 00:05:11,208
[HANAMARU] Wow! It really
is a sea of knowledge.

97
00:05:11,291 --> 00:05:13,333
Everyone must know
everything now, huh?

98
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:14,791
Yeah!

99
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:16,291
And to switch to the other
window you just click here.

100
00:05:16,375 --> 00:05:17,833
So cool, zura!

101
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,250
Hey. Aren't we supposed
to be practicing?

102
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,291
I think it can wait
a few more minutes.

103
00:05:22,375 --> 00:05:24,375
Besides, I'm more worried
about how we're gonna

104
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:25,916
increase our ranking.

105
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,208
It'll be tough with so many
other school idols out there.

106
00:05:28,291 --> 00:05:31,166
Especially with us living way
out here in the boonies!

107
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:34,250
We're plain and we're boring!
The Queens of Average!

108
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,458
All hail the Queens of Average.

109
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,625
I don't understand why we
have to stand out though.

110
00:05:38,708 --> 00:05:40,625
'Cause it'll help
our popularity.

111
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:43,125
What can we do to set
ourselves apart?

112
00:05:43,208 --> 00:05:44,875
Let's see...

113
00:05:44,958 --> 00:05:47,875
Here's a thought. Maybe we could
try changing our group name

114
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:49,750
to something a little
more eccentric?

115
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:53,083
That "Something" being
"The Three Mermaids"?

116
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,250
Oh, wait it's five now!

117
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,875
"The Five Mermaids"
would be adorable!

118
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:58,791
[ALL giggling]

119
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:00,458
Come swimming with us!

120
00:06:00,541 --> 00:06:03,208
[ALL]
For we are "The Five Mermaids"!

121
00:06:03,291 --> 00:06:04,916
Would you please stop
bringing that up?!

122
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,583
But dancing in those
fins would be tough.

123
00:06:06,666 --> 00:06:08,166
I know, I know!

124
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,333
We'll tell them to cheer for us
so our fins will turn into legs!

125
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:13,083
[CHIKA] Oh my gosh yes,
that's an awesome idea!

126
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:16,166
But in exchange for them, we'll
have to give up our voices.

127
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,500
But we need those!

128
00:06:17,583 --> 00:06:20,333
Enough with the stupid
mermaid ideas, all right?

129
00:06:20,416 --> 00:06:22,625
Truly, "The Little Mermaid"
is a tragic tale.

130
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:23,708
Don't you agree?

131
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:24,583
[CHIKA]
Yes.

132
00:06:24,666 --> 00:06:26,083
[RIKO]
You're just being mean!

133
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:29,000
I don't recall any of your
original ideas being any better!

134
00:06:29,083 --> 00:06:30,250
[CHIKA] Yeah well, I
don't recall them being

135
00:06:30,333 --> 00:06:31,791
any worse either!

136
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:34,208
Curses! I was really hoping
nobody would be up here today.

137
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:35,208
[YOU]
Does it even really matter?

138
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:36,333
S'that Yoshiko?

139
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,541
[gasps] Zuramaru!

140
00:06:37,625 --> 00:06:39,541
Uh! Stealth mode!

141
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,083
[HANAMARU]
Huh...

142
00:06:42,166 --> 00:06:43,666
[STUDENT 5AA]
Wanna grab a bite to eat?

143
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:44,875
[STUDENT 5BB]
Sure thing!

144
00:06:44,958 --> 00:06:46,000
[YOSHIKO] No one should
be able to locate me

145
00:06:46,083 --> 00:06:49,291
while I'm using my
stealth mode powers.

146
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:50,791
Well, look-ee who
we have here.

147
00:06:50,875 --> 00:06:54,166
[YOSHIKO screaming]
Yeah? Well, what of it?

148
00:06:54,250 --> 00:06:55,750
I just happened to
accidentally descend

149
00:06:55,833 --> 00:06:58,208
from the heavens inside
the school, like you do.

150
00:06:58,291 --> 00:06:59,750
It happens.

151
00:06:59,833 --> 00:07:02,250
[YOSHIKO] Don't act like
everything is normal! Spill it!

152
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:04,333
What have people in class
been saying about me?

153
00:07:04,416 --> 00:07:05,875
Huh?

154
00:07:05,958 --> 00:07:08,000
Come on, you know what I mean!
Tell me what they're saying!

155
00:07:08,083 --> 00:07:10,541
Like, "Yoshiko's so weird!"
and then like,

156
00:07:10,625 --> 00:07:14,291
"She called us demons,
tee-hee!" Tell me!

157
00:07:14,375 --> 00:07:15,375
[HANAMARU]
Oh...

158
00:07:15,458 --> 00:07:16,666
Crap, I knew it!

159
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,500
Your response has confirmed
my deepest fears!

160
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:21,458
Everyone probably thinks I'm
a complete and utter nut job!

161
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:23,541
You mortals will
never understand!

162
00:07:23,625 --> 00:07:26,416
I retreat. To solitude!

163
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,666
To tell you the truth,

164
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:30,375
I haven't heard anyone
mention a word about it.

165
00:07:30,458 --> 00:07:33,208
Really! I think you're
probably overreactin' a bit.

166
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:34,541
[YOSHIKO]
I'm not!

167
00:07:34,625 --> 00:07:35,875
Wait, what?

168
00:07:35,958 --> 00:07:38,833
[laughs] Actually most people
are wonderin' why

169
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,333
you aren't comin' to school.

170
00:07:40,416 --> 00:07:42,166
Seems they're worried they
did or said somethin'

171
00:07:42,250 --> 00:07:44,125
to make you stay home.

172
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:45,416
Wow, really?

173
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:47,208
[HANAMARU]
Yep.

174
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,583
[YOSHIKO]
Is that the truth?

175
00:07:48,666 --> 00:07:50,083
Do you swear on it?

176
00:07:50,166 --> 00:07:52,708
Cross your heart and hope to
fall from the heavens above?

177
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:55,291
Uh. I swear.

178
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:57,333
[YOSHIKO]
Okay! It's not too late!

179
00:07:57,416 --> 00:07:59,458
I can still be normal!

180
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,500
This is my chance
for a fresh start!

181
00:08:02,583 --> 00:08:03,666
Zuramaru!

182
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:05,500
[whimpering] Is that me, zura?

183
00:08:05,583 --> 00:08:09,500
Yohane has a very
special mission for you.

184
00:08:09,583 --> 00:08:10,416
[STUDENT 5CC]
Good morning.

185
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:12,333
[STUDENT 5DD]
Hey there.

186
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:21,916
[STUDENTS]
Ah...

187
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,833
[YOSHIKO laughs]
Excellent, they've noticed me.

188
00:08:24,916 --> 00:08:26,166
Like Zuramaru said,

189
00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,666
they don't seem to remember
my previous actions.

190
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:31,291
All right!

191
00:08:31,375 --> 00:08:32,208
Good morning!

192
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,875
[ALL]
Oh. Uh, good morning!

193
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:35,750
[STUDENTS chattering]

194
00:08:35,833 --> 00:08:36,791
[STUDENT 5A]
It's surprising,

195
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,375
you seem so different
from before!

196
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,500
And we were super
worried about you.

197
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:43,041
Since you stopped coming
to school and all that.

198
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,583
I'm so sorry!

199
00:08:44,666 --> 00:08:47,208
I'm glad to be back and hope we
can be friends. Sound good?

200
00:08:47,291 --> 00:08:48,708
Absolutely!

201
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:52,375
I was wondering... What
was your first name again?

202
00:08:52,458 --> 00:08:53,916
You don't remember?

203
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,291
Oh wait, I don't either.

204
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:57,583
Help us out, here! Was it, Yo...

205
00:08:57,666 --> 00:08:59,375
Yo... Yoha.

206
00:08:59,458 --> 00:09:03,250
Yoshiko! You can just
call me Yoshiko, okay?

207
00:09:03,333 --> 00:09:04,958
Oh, sure thing!

208
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:06,125
[STUDENTS laughing]

209
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,791
[RUBY] Looks like
Yoshiko's finally back.

210
00:09:07,875 --> 00:09:08,875
Yep!

211
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:10,791
I accepted her
special mission, zura!

212
00:09:10,875 --> 00:09:12,291
What mission is that?

213
00:09:12,375 --> 00:09:13,166
Monitor you?

214
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,541
Please accept.

215
00:09:14,625 --> 00:09:17,083
You see the fallen angel
Yohane only tends to emerge

216
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,750
when I'm being careless.
You can help me.

217
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:22,250
Basically I'm supposed to stop
her if things get weird!

218
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:24,750
[RUBY] Like if the fallen
angel comes out?

219
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,916
[STUDENT 5B] Hey, what kind
of hobbies do you have?

220
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,666
Hobbies?

221
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:31,750
Uh... None that I can think of.

222
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:33,250
[YOSHIKO] Hold up,
I can't waste my chance

223
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:34,416
to fit in with everyone!

224
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:36,375
I'll make the class
like me even more!

225
00:09:36,458 --> 00:09:39,083
Uh. Except for fortune telling.

226
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,458
Whoa, for real?!

227
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:43,083
Can you please tell my fortune?

228
00:09:43,166 --> 00:09:44,375
Well, sure!

229
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,291
Let's see...

230
00:09:46,375 --> 00:09:47,375
Oh!

231
00:09:47,458 --> 00:09:49,541
Why don't we do it
right here, okay?

232
00:09:49,625 --> 00:09:52,250
[STUDENTS laughing, cheering]

233
00:09:52,333 --> 00:09:53,625
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

234
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:56,958
[STUDENTS]
Huh?

235
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,916
'Kay, I'm ready!

236
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,958
Here! Will you please
light the candle?

237
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:05,083
Huh?!

238
00:10:05,166 --> 00:10:07,416
[YOSHIKO] Oh. Hear
me spirits that sprawl

239
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,041
in the heavens and underworld,

240
00:10:09,125 --> 00:10:12,583
I make a proclamation to you
who dwell in purgatory.

241
00:10:12,666 --> 00:10:17,875
Lucifer, who baptized Azmodeus,
join the fallen angel Yohane.

242
00:10:17,958 --> 00:10:19,333
Ha!

243
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:22,916
The time has come for
you all to descend!

244
00:10:27,958 --> 00:10:30,666
[YOSHIKO]
I did it again!

245
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:33,708
[exhales]

246
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:37,250
[YOSHIKO]
You were supposed to monitor me!

247
00:10:37,333 --> 00:10:40,791
Now everything is
ruined! [cries]

248
00:10:40,875 --> 00:10:42,875
You realize I had no
possible way of knowin'

249
00:10:42,958 --> 00:10:44,416
you were carryin' that
stuff around.

250
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,250
What exactly happened?

251
00:10:46,333 --> 00:10:49,250
I only just heard about
this myself, but...

252
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,166
Apparently back when she
was in middle school,

253
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:53,000
Yoshiko was convinced
she was actually

254
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:55,500
a fallen angel from heaven.

255
00:10:56,375 --> 00:10:57,333
Behold mortals!

256
00:10:57,416 --> 00:10:59,416
A heavenly being
stands before you!

257
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,458
Fallen angel, Yohane!

258
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:05,125
Would you like to
descend with me?

259
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,791
As it turns out,
she hasn't managed

260
00:11:06,875 --> 00:11:09,750
to really break the habit yet.

261
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:11,291
[YOSHIKO]
I understand.

262
00:11:11,375 --> 00:11:13,750
I know I'm not a
real fallen angel.

263
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,458
How could I be?

264
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,541
They don't even really exist.

265
00:11:17,625 --> 00:11:19,041
Seriously?

266
00:11:19,125 --> 00:11:20,625
So why'd you bring that weird
stuff to school with you?

267
00:11:20,708 --> 00:11:22,375
[YOSHIKO]
Well, I can explain!

268
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:26,041
That "weird stuff" is crucial
to Yohane's identity.

269
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,541
Without those things,

270
00:11:27,625 --> 00:11:30,375
I would lack the ability to
descend from the heavens!

271
00:11:30,458 --> 00:11:31,666
Guh!

272
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,250
I'm starting to understand
you're going through

273
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:36,625
a complicated phase right now.
I'm sure it's perfectly normal.

274
00:11:36,708 --> 00:11:37,791
[RUBY]
Check this out!

275
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:39,208
I did a search for her online;

276
00:11:39,291 --> 00:11:41,125
it looks like she does
do fortune telling.

277
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:41,708
[CHIKA]
Oh?

278
00:11:41,791 --> 00:11:42,958
[RUBY]
Uh...

279
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,208
[YOSHIKO] Come, descend
with Yohane once again.

280
00:11:45,291 --> 00:11:46,958
[YOSHIKO screams]
Turn it off!

281
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:49,250
Look, I just wanna be a
normal high school student!

282
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,250
More than anything!

283
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:52,708
You gotta help me!

284
00:11:52,791 --> 00:11:54,583
Zura...

285
00:11:54,666 --> 00:11:55,833
You're so cute.

286
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:56,708
[RUBY, HANAMARU]
Hm?

287
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:58,333
Huh?

288
00:11:58,416 --> 00:12:01,375
I found it! What
we've been missing!

289
00:12:01,458 --> 00:12:02,791
I don't follow.

290
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:04,333
Listen to me, Yoshiko!

291
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:08,000
I mean... listen to me, Yohane!

292
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:12,208
Would you like to join us?
And be a school idol?

293
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:14,041
Say what?

294
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:16,625
[CHIKA]
Love Live! Sunshine!!

295
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:21,166
[RIKO]
We-We're going to sing in this?

296
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:24,000
They're even shorter
than the last ones!

297
00:12:24,083 --> 00:12:25,833
People are sure to see our--!

298
00:12:25,916 --> 00:12:26,916
I've got shorts!

299
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,250
[RIKO]
Stop it, pull your skirt down!

300
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:32,166
[sighs] I just don't
know about this idea.

301
00:12:32,250 --> 00:12:35,083
Don't worry! I searched the web
for fallen angel idols, and

302
00:12:35,166 --> 00:12:37,625
there weren't any! We're
gonna stand out for sure.

303
00:12:37,708 --> 00:12:38,750
I suppose.

304
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,375
These costumes are
more unique anyway.

305
00:12:41,458 --> 00:12:42,583
Really unique.

306
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:45,583
I'll say. It's a
little embarrassing.

307
00:12:45,666 --> 00:12:47,958
I'm not comfortable in this.

308
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,166
Hey, should we really be
wearing these clothes?

309
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,583
Much less performing in them?

310
00:12:51,666 --> 00:12:52,958
Right, 'cause they're adorable!

311
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:54,666
[RIKO]
That is not what I mean.

312
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,875
I don't know.

313
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,250
No way this is gonna work.

314
00:12:57,333 --> 00:12:59,000
It's going to be super awesome!

315
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:00,500
We'll go out onstage and sing,

316
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:03,875
then everyone will see how
charming a fallen angel can be!

317
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,250
A fallen angel can be charming?

318
00:13:07,333 --> 00:13:09,125
Uh? Absolutely not!

319
00:13:09,208 --> 00:13:11,250
People are just gonna think
we're a bunch of weirdos!

320
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:12,750
No, they're going to love us!

321
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,000
Trust me!

[AUDIENCE cheering]

323
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:19,333
[YOSHIKO]
Discarded from the very heavens,

324
00:13:19,416 --> 00:13:23,250
I'm the fallen angel Yohane!

325
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:25,583
Watch me descend!

326
00:13:26,416 --> 00:13:27,333
They love me! [laughs]

327
00:13:27,416 --> 00:13:28,833
She's laughing.

328
00:13:28,916 --> 00:13:30,583
That's probably a
good sign, right?

329
00:13:30,666 --> 00:13:32,583
I guess it's decided.

330
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:36,291
[MITO] There, there,
who's a good doggie?

331
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,625
Hey there. How's it going?

332
00:13:39,708 --> 00:13:44,833
[RIKO whimpers]

333
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:45,541
[YOU]
Hm...

334
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:47,583

Shiitake, no!

[CHIKA]
What's going on?

337
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,916
[RIKO screaming]
Get down!

338
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,708
Just calm down!
Shiitake won't hurt you!

339
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,166
[screaming]

340
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:00,333
Ow, my face!

341
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:04,791
[RIKO]
Get away!

Whoa, perfect form!

[ALL]
Wow!

346
00:14:12,541 --> 00:14:14,166
[RIKO groans]
Chika!

347
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:16,500
[RIKO'S MOM]
Welcome home.

348
00:14:16,583 --> 00:14:19,416
Oh, hey, Mom...

349
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:22,125
[CHIKA] I'll leave the
costumes to you, then!

350
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:24,833
Aye, aye, Chika!

351
00:14:26,375 --> 00:14:27,541
[HANAMARU]
We should go, too.

352
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,208
[RUBY]
Have a good one! Bye-bye!

353
00:14:29,291 --> 00:14:30,666
[CHIKA]
'Kay, see ya!

354
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:32,041
Ow, it's still tender.

355
00:14:32,125 --> 00:14:33,041
I bet!

356
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:34,833
I'm glad you think
it's so funny.

357
00:14:34,916 --> 00:14:37,333
You'd better put that dog up
the next time I'm over there!

358
00:14:37,416 --> 00:14:39,375
[CHIKA]
Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

359
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,833
Oh jeez. Do you always
laugh at your friends

360
00:14:41,916 --> 00:14:43,375
when they're really distressed?

361
00:14:43,458 --> 00:14:45,333
Well, no, not usually.

362
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:48,291
I was really just thinking about
how different we all are!

363
00:14:48,375 --> 00:14:49,875
Uh?

364
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:53,208
I'm super happy that we started
the School Idol Club together.

365
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,458
It's hard to believe,

366
00:14:54,541 --> 00:14:56,541
but I used to think we
were normal and boring.

367
00:14:56,625 --> 00:14:58,333
Are you still obsessing
over that?

368
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:01,041
[CHIKA] I can't help it!
This whole thing was my idea,

369
00:15:01,125 --> 00:15:04,083
so I feel I gotta
take responsibility.

370
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:07,458
But deep down, I know I lack
the necessary leadership skills

371
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,625
to run this group on my own.

372
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,625
Wow, Chika...

373
00:15:11,708 --> 00:15:14,333
But the more I get
to know everyone,

374
00:15:14,416 --> 00:15:16,166
the more I see how
unique we are!

375
00:15:16,250 --> 00:15:18,958
Each of us has her own
personality and charm.

376
00:15:19,041 --> 00:15:22,875
We're anything but ordinary,
and I think we're very special.

377
00:15:22,958 --> 00:15:27,500
Together, I know we can
shine the brightest!

378
00:15:27,583 --> 00:15:29,333
I always knew you were a weirdo.

379
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:30,833
[yelps]

380
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:33,083
I've thought that since the
day I met you at the harbor.

381
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:34,750
Wait a sec, are you
complimenting me

382
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,083
or insulting me?

383
00:15:36,166 --> 00:15:37,291
Maybe both.

384
00:15:37,375 --> 00:15:39,333
What?! You can't do
both at the same time!

385
00:15:39,416 --> 00:15:42,333
Anyway, Chika, let's
continue to do our best.

386
00:15:42,416 --> 00:15:43,875
We're going to show everybody

387
00:15:43,958 --> 00:15:47,875
what a bunch of normal girls
like us are capable of, right?

388
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:52,125
[gasps] I still feel like you're
insulting me, but okay.

389
00:15:52,208 --> 00:15:53,625
[RIKO]
Bet I can beat you back home!

390
00:15:53,708 --> 00:15:56,041
[CHIKA] No fair, cheater!
Uh oh, watch out for Shiitake!

391
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:56,958
[RIKO]
Uh?!

392
00:15:57,041 --> 00:15:58,750
[CHIKA]
Made ya look! [laughs]

393
00:15:58,833 --> 00:16:02,916
Now... The prophesied angel has
fallen upon the beaches of Izu,

394
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:04,416
to say hello!

395
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:07,833
Join with Yohane, and descend!

396
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:09,958
[ALL]
Please join us!

397
00:16:11,916 --> 00:16:13,750
[RIKO]
I can't believe I did that.

398
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,500
[CHIKA]
Well, You? Whaddya think?

399
00:16:15,583 --> 00:16:16,541
We're about to see.

400
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:17,791
[computer chimes]

401
00:16:17,875 --> 00:16:19,083
[CHIKA]
No way!

402
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:21,125
Our rank just jumped way up!

403
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:23,125
That crazy idea really worked?

404
00:16:23,208 --> 00:16:25,458
Check out all the new
comments! Yay, us!

405

"I'd fall for Ruby any day."

[HANAMARU]
"Ruby is adorable."

407
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:32,750
[RIKO] "Ruby looks so great in
her cute little mini-skirt."

[RUBY]
"I love Ruby's smile."

409
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,375
[gasping] Oh, I'm flattered!

410
00:16:37,458 --> 00:16:39,958
Hi, I'm the fourth demon
under Lady Yohane.

411
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:40,916
I'm...

412
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I'm Ruby Kurosawa.

413
00:16:43,083 --> 00:16:45,500
As the littlest demon
of our group, it's...

414
00:16:45,583 --> 00:16:46,541
...nice to meet ya!

415
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,041
Oh! What an adorable <i>bella</i> !

416
00:16:49,125 --> 00:16:52,458
[DIA] Adorable?
It's far from adorable!

417
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:55,791
It's shameless! It's disgusting!

418
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,625
Come on, they're only
stage costumes, right?

419
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,083
We were just acting!

420
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:02,708
This is exactly why I was
opposed to this whole idea!

421
00:17:02,791 --> 00:17:05,500
That's enough! The only
reason I even permitted

422
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:07,958
my sister to join this
ridiculous School Idol Club

423
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:10,250
was because I never knew
that the group would...

424
00:17:10,333 --> 00:17:12,500
Well, dress her up in that
travesty of a costume!

425
00:17:12,583 --> 00:17:15,166
But, I'm really sorry, Dia.

426
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:17,708
Besides... Doing demeaning
things to raise your rank

427
00:17:17,791 --> 00:17:19,750
is insulting and I
will not allow it!

428
00:17:19,833 --> 00:17:23,083
Those sorts of actions will not
be tolerated in the future!

429
00:17:23,166 --> 00:17:25,791
But still, our goal was to
raise our rank and we did.

430
00:17:25,875 --> 00:17:28,250
You may have raised it,
but only temporarily.

431
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:31,375
Such basic methods will never
yield long lasting results.

432
00:17:31,458 --> 00:17:35,166
[gasping, sighs]

433
00:17:35,250 --> 00:17:36,666
Huh?!

434
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,375
[DIA] If you're truly serious
about being idols,

435
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:42,250
you should rethink
your strategy.

436
00:17:42,333 --> 00:17:44,833
[CHIKA]
Yes ma'am.

437
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:48,375
[CHIKA]
That was a bust.

438
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:51,375
The president really hit the
nail on the head, didn't she?

439
00:17:51,458 --> 00:17:53,666
We insulted Mu's by
dressing up like that.

440
00:17:53,750 --> 00:17:55,083
It's just plain rude of us.

441
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:57,083
You can't blame yourself
for this, Chika!

442
00:17:57,166 --> 00:17:57,833
[YOSHIKO]
She's right.

443
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:58,916
[ALL]
Mm?

444
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,291
[YOSHIKO]
Blame Yohane.

445
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:02,416
It's her fault.

446
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,916
[CHIKA]
Huh?

447
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,333
Honestly, I should have dropped
this act a long time ago.

448
00:18:06,416 --> 00:18:07,083
Yoshiko!

449
00:18:07,166 --> 00:18:08,166
[YOSHIKO]
It's true!

450
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:09,833
And, it's okay.

451
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,666
Starting tomorrow, I can finally
be a normal high schooler.

452
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,416
[RUBY] But, what about
being a school idol?

453
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,291
[YOSHIKO]
Mm... I think I'll pass.

454
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:24,666
I don't want to cause
you guys trouble. Bye!

455
00:18:24,750 --> 00:18:27,333
Even though it was only for a
little while, I appreciate you

456
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,625
playing along with the
fallen angel thing.

457
00:18:29,708 --> 00:18:32,291
It was fun, really.

458
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:36,416
I wonder why she wanted
to be a fallen angel?

459
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:40,125
[HANAMARU] I know.
Or at least I can guess.

460
00:18:40,208 --> 00:18:44,000
I think it's because she was
probably always normal...

461
00:18:44,083 --> 00:18:45,708
...like the rest of us.

462
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:48,625
She never really
stood out before.

463
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:53,250
[HANAMARU] Have you ever asked
yourself that question?

464
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:57,291
"Is this the real me, or am I
meant to be somethin' more?

465
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:59,541
Maybe I was once
a sparkling angel,

466
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:01,291
but now I'm stuck on Earth."

467
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:04,125
I think Yoshiko just wanted
to feel like she was special.

468
00:19:04,208 --> 00:19:05,208
I mean, don't we all?

469
00:19:05,291 --> 00:19:06,958
I see.

470
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:12,333
I can understand that feeling;
it makes perfect sense.

471
00:19:12,416 --> 00:19:14,666
When we were in
kindergarten together,

472
00:19:14,750 --> 00:19:16,791
Yoshiko used to say...

473
00:19:16,875 --> 00:19:19,791
[YOSHIKO] Did you know I'm
really an angel from heaven?

474
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:21,541
One day I'm gonna
grow some wings!

475
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,125
Then I'll soar through the sky!

476
00:19:23,208 --> 00:19:25,625
Zura!

477
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,291
Yeah.

478
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:42,666
This is how it should be.

479
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:00,875
[CHIKA]
Hey, Fallen Angel Yohane.

480
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:02,166
[YOSHIKO]
Huh?

481
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:08,041
[ALL] Please, join our club
and become a school idol!

482
00:20:08,125 --> 00:20:10,791
[YOSHIKO]
Uh...? Huh?

483
00:20:10,875 --> 00:20:13,083
[CHIKA laughs]
Come on, you heard us!

484
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,291
Join our group!

485
00:20:14,375 --> 00:20:16,375
We'd love to have
Yohane on board!

486
00:20:16,458 --> 00:20:19,958
What are talking about?
Didn't you hear me yesterday?

487
00:20:20,041 --> 00:20:20,791
I...

488
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,833
We don't care! Just be you!

489
00:20:22,916 --> 00:20:25,750
Even if that means
being a fallen angel!

490
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,125
I'm sorry!

491
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:28,916
[ALL gasp]

492
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,208
Wait!

493
00:20:30,291 --> 00:20:32,541
I made the student council
president mad at us!

494
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:33,791
[CHIKA]
No!

495
00:20:33,875 --> 00:20:35,416
It was my fault for not
thinking things through!

496
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,541
You're fine the way
you are, Yoshiko!

497
00:20:37,625 --> 00:20:38,750
Trust me!

498
00:20:38,833 --> 00:20:41,916
[YOSHIKO]
What does that even mean?!

499
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,833
Excuse me, ma'am!

500
00:20:47,541 --> 00:20:49,458
[YOSHIKO]
Go away!

501
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:50,791
[CHIKA]
You know what?

502
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:53,833
I think I understand how
Mu's became so legendary!

503
00:20:53,916 --> 00:20:56,916
I get how they connected
school idols the way they did!

504
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:59,791
At least hear me out, please!

505
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,833
[YOSHIKO]
Stop! Just cut it out already!

506
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:08,208
[ALL panting]

507
00:21:08,291 --> 00:21:10,583
[CHIKA] When they were on
stage, they showed everyone

508
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,583
exactly what they loved
without any hesitation.

509
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:18,125
[pants] It didn't matter what
others might think of them,

510
00:21:18,208 --> 00:21:19,791
or how popular they
might become,

511
00:21:19,875 --> 00:21:23,208
'cause the most important thing
is to show your favorite self!

512
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:26,041
Your shining self!
Don't let it go!

513
00:21:26,125 --> 00:21:29,250
You have to love every single
part of yourself, Yoshiko!

514
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:32,958
Including Yohane,
the Fallen Angel!

515
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,458
You sure? I might say
weird stuff again.

516
00:21:38,541 --> 00:21:40,000
That's okay.

517
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:42,625
And there might be some times
when I perform rituals.

518
00:21:42,708 --> 00:21:44,708
I think we can probably
manage a few.

519
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:46,875
What if I order you
to become my demons?

520
00:21:46,958 --> 00:21:48,750
Well, let's see...

521
00:21:48,833 --> 00:21:51,416
I guess, If I don't like it,
I can always refuse.

522
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,708
Uh?

523
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:57,250
[gasps]

524
00:21:57,333 --> 00:21:59,083
Come with us.

525
00:22:06,708 --> 00:22:08,166
[CHIKA laughs]

526
00:22:08,250 --> 00:22:10,250
[YOSHIKO laughs]

527
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:14,875
[DIA]
Mari!

528
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,958
That's me! Can I help you?

529
00:22:17,041 --> 00:22:18,916
What is the meaning
of your e-mail?!

530
00:22:19,000 --> 00:22:20,166
You don't know?

531
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:22,125
I like totally made
it crystal clear.

532
00:22:22,208 --> 00:22:24,291
[DIA]
No way.

533
00:22:24,375 --> 00:22:26,875
You have got to be kidding!

534
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,625
[GIRLS]
Next time, "Let's make a PV!"
