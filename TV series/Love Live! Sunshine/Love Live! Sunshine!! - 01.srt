1
00:00:12,541 --> 00:00:15,291
[CHIKA] It was the miracle
that I desperately needed.

2
00:00:19,458 --> 00:00:23,333
[CHIKA] It could only
be one thing... fate.

3
00:00:24,875 --> 00:00:26,750
[YOU, CHIKA gasping]

4
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:30,208
Look! Come on, Chika!

5
00:00:30,958 --> 00:00:33,291
[CHIKA] I wanted to be
captivated by something.

6
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:34,541
Take one!

7
00:00:34,625 --> 00:00:36,708
[CHIKA] I wanted to do
my best in something.

8
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:37,750
[BOTH gasping]

9
00:00:37,833 --> 00:00:39,250
I'll help you!

10
00:00:39,333 --> 00:00:42,625
[CHIKA] I just wanted to put
my best foot forward, but...

11
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:46,333
...my feet didn't exactly know
where they were going yet.

12
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,541
[CHIKA] Luckily, destiny
stepped in and took charge.

13
00:00:54,625 --> 00:00:58,500
It gave me a push,
and there it was!

14
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:04,916
[CHIKA laughs]

15
00:01:05,875 --> 00:01:10,750
[CHIKA gasping]

16
00:01:14,666 --> 00:01:16,625
[CHIKA]
The something!

17
00:02:49,375 --> 00:02:54,083
[STUDENTS chattering]

18
00:02:57,583 --> 00:02:59,541
[CHIKA]
Join the School Idol Club!

19
00:02:59,625 --> 00:03:01,541
Starting this Spring!

20
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,916
School Idol Club!

21
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,041
[CHIKA]
Sign up today and don't delay!

22
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:07,666
You! You!

23
00:03:07,750 --> 00:03:10,333
Come on, embrace
your inner idol!

24
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,291
The School Idol Club wants you!

25
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:15,458
Don't you want
the Idol Club too?!

26
00:03:20,625 --> 00:03:21,833
[YOU]
Uh, Chika?

27
00:03:21,916 --> 00:03:25,166
[CHIKA whines]
They all just ignored me.

28
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,375
[YOU]
Uh...

29
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:28,541
[CHIKA] Why doesn't
anyone wanna sign up?

30
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:33,458
We're so... cool!

31
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,583
[CHIKA groans]

32
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:40,750
What was that?

33
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:43,083
If I had to guess,
I would say Chika.

34
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:45,333
Is this about that
idol nonsense again?

35
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:47,333
The noise is gonna
bother our customers.

36
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:49,333
I asked her to keep it down.

37
00:03:49,416 --> 00:03:51,125
She's living in a dream world!

38
00:03:51,208 --> 00:03:54,375
Things work too differently
way out here in the country!

39
00:03:54,458 --> 00:03:56,125
Aw, man, that one hurt.

40
00:03:56,208 --> 00:03:57,875
Is anything injured?

41
00:03:57,958 --> 00:03:59,541
Nah, only my pride!

42
00:03:59,625 --> 00:04:01,166
Whatcha think?

43
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:01,916
Tell me!

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,416
[YOU]
Mm... Well...

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:05,250
[CHIKA laughs]

46
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:06,875
Looks good to me!

47
00:04:06,958 --> 00:04:08,333
Hooray!

48
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:10,500
So are you really serious
about this club?

49
00:04:10,583 --> 00:04:11,333
[CHIKA]
Yep!

50
00:04:11,416 --> 00:04:12,500
What the...?

51
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,208
Check it out, I plan
on setting it all up

52
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,291
right after we start
the new term!

53
00:04:16,375 --> 00:04:18,541
Heh. Okay. Any members? Oh!

54
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,875
As of right now, nobody, unless
of course you count

55
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:23,541
me, myself, and I.
You're already in swim club.

56
00:04:23,625 --> 00:04:26,333
No offense, but this school idol
thing seems kind of sudden.

57
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,791
It does?

58
00:04:27,875 --> 00:04:30,041
Well, yeah. I mean, it's not
like you've ever taken

59
00:04:30,125 --> 00:04:32,958
any sort of interest in club
activities before, so...

60
00:04:33,041 --> 00:04:34,750
...what's the deal?

61
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,791
[CHIKA laughs]

62
00:04:36,875 --> 00:04:38,583
[YOU]
Mm...

63
00:04:38,666 --> 00:04:42,166
[BOTH gasp] If we don't hurry,
we'll miss the bus!

64
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,875
[SHIMA]
Chika! You! Hey, hey!

65
00:04:43,958 --> 00:04:46,333
What have I told you girls about
using the guest entrance?

66
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:48,083
[CHIKA, YOU]
It's an emergency!

67
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:48,958
[horn honks]

68
00:04:49,041 --> 00:04:50,166
[YOU gasps]
There it goes!

69
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,708
[CHIKA]
We want on!

70
00:04:52,791 --> 00:04:55,458
[CHIKA, YOU]
Stop that bus!

71
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:02,750
[YOU, CHIKA sigh]

72
00:05:02,833 --> 00:05:04,625
Thank goodness they
stopped for us!

73
00:05:04,708 --> 00:05:08,416
We'd be super late if we had to
wait for the next one.

74
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,458
[YOU] Whoa, you've already made
a flyer?

75
00:05:10,541 --> 00:05:12,875
Yep! Nothing wrong
with being prepared.

76
00:05:12,958 --> 00:05:15,958
Ah... Plus I'm super excited!

77
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,375
Well, yeah. It's just...

78
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:19,375
Is something wrong?

79
00:05:19,458 --> 00:05:21,416
No! I'm excited, too!

80
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,708
I'll do my very best
to help you out, Chika!

81
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,250
The School Idol Club
needs people like you.

82

[wind blows]

83
00:05:29,708 --> 00:05:33,583

and too good to be true.

85
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:37,333
Well don't rush in all at once.

Hiya!

92
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,250
Ever thought of becoming
a school idol?

93
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,500
Zura?

Forget I said it!

Anyway, I promise our
club will be tons of fun!

97
00:06:00,583 --> 00:06:02,583
I'm sure you'd both be very
popular!

98
00:06:02,666 --> 00:06:04,583
So, what do you think?

99
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:06,875
[HANAMARU]
Huh? You want us to be idols?

Are you interested?

It sounds cool!
Do you put on concerts?

104
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:18,208
[CHIKA] Mm-mm. Well, I mean,
not as of right now.

105
00:06:18,291 --> 00:06:19,541
I'm still putting
everything together,

106
00:06:19,625 --> 00:06:21,083
that's why I need
a cutie like you!

gonna be okay?

It's so lowly!

Oh no, she's brain damaged!

No, not at all!

126
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:01,000
Ordinary humans
such as yourselves

127
00:07:01,083 --> 00:07:04,000
could never comprehend the
greatness standing before you!

[YOU]
Whoa.

129
00:07:05,333 --> 00:07:07,750
Okay, I'm more worried
about your legs though.

130
00:07:07,833 --> 00:07:10,750
[groans] Pain is just
a state of mind!

131
00:07:10,833 --> 00:07:14,083
For this fragile meat vessel
is only too temporary!

132
00:07:14,166 --> 00:07:16,333
You might assume that I
am one of your own kind,

133
00:07:16,416 --> 00:07:19,208
but in fact I am Yohane,
the fallen angel!

134
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,750
Oops, I probably shouldn't have
revealed my true identity!

135
00:07:21,833 --> 00:07:22,375
Guess there's no...

136
00:07:22,458 --> 00:07:24,791
Hold up, Yoshiko?

137
00:07:24,875 --> 00:07:26,583
Oh my gosh, it is you!

138
00:07:26,666 --> 00:07:28,458
It's me Hanamaru!

139
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,458
From kindergarten, remember?

140
00:07:30,541 --> 00:07:34,500
Ha-na-ma-ru-ru?

141
00:07:34,583 --> 00:07:38,166
I know not of whom you speak,
you insolent girl!

142
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,083
Rock... Paper...

[HANAMARU, YOSHIKO]
....Scissors!

144
00:07:41,666 --> 00:07:44,083
Look at those scissors;
you're definitely Yoshiko!

145
00:07:44,166 --> 00:07:45,458
That is a human name!

146
00:07:45,541 --> 00:07:48,375
I'm Yohane, the fallen
angel, got it?!

147
00:07:48,458 --> 00:07:49,208
Yohane!

Hey!

[YOSHIKO]
Ah! Get lost!

151
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,958
[HANAMARU]
Yoshiko, Don't run away!

152
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,583
[RUBY]
Slow down!

153
00:07:56,666 --> 00:07:58,958
[YOSHIKO]
Beat it, mortal!

154
00:07:59,041 --> 00:08:00,791
[CHIKA]
That was strange.

155
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,875
Oh well, I'm gonna recruit
those girls later!

156
00:08:02,958 --> 00:08:04,375
[laughs]

157
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,791
Are these flyers yours?

158
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:07,583
Were you the ones
passing them out earlier?

159
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:08,833
[BOTH]
Huh?

160
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,791
I wasn't aware we had
a School Idol Club here

161
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,291
at Uranohoshi
Girls' High School,

162
00:08:12,375 --> 00:08:15,416
so perhaps you could
enlighten me?

163
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,583
Are you a new
student at this school?

164
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,500
No, she's not a new
student, stupid!

165
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,041
She's actually one
of the third years!

166
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:25,000
And more importantly, she is...

167
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,500
No way!

168
00:08:28,833 --> 00:08:31,500
[CHIKA]
The Student Council President?

169
00:08:32,416 --> 00:08:34,416
[DIA] Basically, you were
recruiting new members

170
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:36,125
for a club you've
yet to apply for,

171
00:08:36,208 --> 00:08:38,041
further more you have
not received permission

172
00:08:38,125 --> 00:08:39,583
to start said club.

173
00:08:39,666 --> 00:08:41,083
Is that against the rules?

174
00:08:41,166 --> 00:08:43,333
I wasn't trying to cause
trouble or anything!

175
00:08:43,416 --> 00:08:45,458
I'm just really excited
about this club,

176
00:08:45,541 --> 00:08:47,375
so I might have jumped
the gun a bit.

177
00:08:47,458 --> 00:08:49,958
Ah-ha. And how many
members do you have?

178
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:53,083
There's only one name written on
the form you've provided me.

179
00:08:53,166 --> 00:08:55,833
Well, if you count
me, uh, just me.

180
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,958
[DIA]
I see.

181
00:08:57,041 --> 00:08:58,458
Need I remind you

182
00:08:58,541 --> 00:09:00,208
that you actually need five
members to start a new club?

183
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:03,500
That's exactly why I was
trying to recruit people, silly!

184
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:04,916
[yelps]

185
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,333
[DIA groaning]

186
00:09:07,416 --> 00:09:10,708
[DIA growls] You're in no
position to be laughing!

187
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:12,333
[CHIKA]
I'm sorry, ma'am!

188
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:15,458
Anyway, as it is, I simply
cannot accept this application.

189
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:16,666
It's far from complete.

190
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:18,166
Wha...?

191
00:09:18,250 --> 00:09:21,875
C'mon Chika, let's just
come back later.

192
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,500
Fine! I'll submit it again
when I have five members!

193
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,666
[DIA] Well, you're free
to do whatever you wish.

194
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:27,875
But don't get your hopes up

195
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,750
in regards to getting
your club approved.

196
00:09:29,833 --> 00:09:31,166
[CHIKA]
Why wouldn't it be?

197
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:33,833
Because as long as I'm the
student council president,

198
00:09:33,916 --> 00:09:36,583
I will never allow a School
Idol Club to form here!

199
00:09:36,666 --> 00:09:38,208
[CHIKA, YOU grunting]

200
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,541
That's... not fair!

201
00:09:45,416 --> 00:09:48,375
[CHIKA]
Well, that was a complete bust.

202
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,333
I mean, what does
President Grumpy Pants

203
00:09:50,416 --> 00:09:53,041
have against School Idol
Clubs anyway?

204
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:54,750
I don't think she's like them.

205
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:56,791
Okay, a while back, one
of the girls in my class

206
00:09:56,875 --> 00:09:59,291
tried to start an Idol Club too
but she also got rejected.

207
00:09:59,375 --> 00:10:01,291
What?! Did you know
that this whole time?!

208
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:02,666
Sorry!

209
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:05,166
[groans] Why didn't you say
something earlier then?

210
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,291
[YOU]
You were so excited.

211
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,666
I didn't want to ruin it for
you.

212
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,458
I heard a rumor...

213
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:14,625
Supposedly, the president comes
from a really old fishing family

214
00:10:14,708 --> 00:10:15,875
or something like that.

215
00:10:15,958 --> 00:10:17,916
Anyway, some of the
other students say

216
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,583
that's why she's so serious.

217
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:23,500
And why she thinks school
idol clubs are ridiculous.

218
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:29,000
There's nothing
ridiculous about them.

219
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,916
[CHIKA]
Ta-dah! We arrived!

220
00:10:33,458 --> 00:10:34,708
You guys are late.

221
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,208
I thought today you
had early release?

222
00:10:37,291 --> 00:10:39,916
[YOU] Yeah, we did, but we
got a little sidetracked.

223
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,208
[CHIKA]
Here!

224
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,958
Straight from my mom
with tender love and care.

225
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,041
Her love usually
involves oranges.

226
00:10:46,125 --> 00:10:48,250
[CHIKA] If you don't want Mom's
love, tell her yourself!

227
00:10:48,333 --> 00:10:49,500
[KANAN laughs]

228
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,833
[KANAN grunts]

229
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:53,916
So Kanan, I don't suppose
there's any chance

230
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:55,833
you'll come back to
school this term?

231
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,000
Well, it's hard to know
for sure at this point.

232
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,958
There's a lot to do here.

233
00:11:00,041 --> 00:11:03,750
And Dad's bone is still healing
up, so I can't really say.

234
00:11:03,833 --> 00:11:05,083
That's too bad.

235
00:11:05,166 --> 00:11:07,708
I was gonna see if you
wanted to sign up as well.

236
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,458
Sign up for what?

237
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:14,458
Since you asked, I've decided
to become a school idol!

238
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:15,916
[KANAN]
Oh yeah?

239
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,083
Just remember that while you
guys may be second years,

240
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:21,041
I'm a third year student, so...

241
00:11:21,125 --> 00:11:22,375
I remember!

242
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:23,541
But you'd be amazing!

243
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:25,416
[KANAN]
From Mom, with love.

244
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:27,666
--[YOU laughs]
--[CHIKA] Aw, dried fish again?

245
00:11:27,750 --> 00:11:29,916
If you don't want Mom's
love, tell her yourself.

246
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,666
But yeah, that's how things are.

247
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:33,958
I'll be back at school
just as soon as I can.

248
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:37,333
In the meantime, keep me
in the loop, okay?

249
00:11:37,416 --> 00:11:39,333
Oh, okay.

250
00:11:39,416 --> 00:11:42,500
[helicopter blades whirling]

251
00:11:42,583 --> 00:11:43,208
Huh?

252
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,500
Hey, what's that noise?

253
00:11:44,583 --> 00:11:46,916
Probably the Oharas.

254
00:11:53,333 --> 00:11:55,916
Two years already.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,833
[CHIKA grunting]

256
00:12:04,916 --> 00:12:07,458
[CHIKA] I have to figure out
a way to make this work.

257
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:10,583
I can't give up
when I'm so close.

258
00:12:28,833 --> 00:12:31,083
[CHIKA gasping]

259
00:12:32,333 --> 00:12:33,500
Huh?

260
00:12:34,541 --> 00:12:35,708
Wha--?

261
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,708
Nah. She's not gonna
swim in April.

262
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:41,666
[RIKO panting]

263
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,958
[yelling]

264
00:12:44,041 --> 00:12:45,125
[CHIKA grunting]
Wait!

265
00:12:45,208 --> 00:12:47,083
That water is freezing!
You'll get sick!

266
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,500
Let go of me! Get off!

267
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,125
I have to do this!

268
00:12:50,208 --> 00:12:52,750
[BOTH grunting]

269
00:12:53,791 --> 00:12:55,000
[CHIKA]
Uh!

270
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:56,250
[RIKO]
Ah!

271
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,625
[RIKO, CHIKA scream]

272
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:06,041
[GIRLS]
Love Live! Sunshine!!

273
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:07,833
[RIKO sneezes]

274
00:13:07,916 --> 00:13:12,083
[CHIKA] Are you okay?
The water's not very warm yet.

275
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:13,583
There are dive shops around

276
00:13:13,666 --> 00:13:17,041
if you really want to go
swimming that badly.

277
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:19,375
I wanted to hear the
sound of the ocean.

278
00:13:19,458 --> 00:13:21,625
Like, inside the ocean?

279
00:13:21,708 --> 00:13:23,666
But, what for?

280
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:28,083
Never mind, I guess it's
none of my business,

281
00:13:28,166 --> 00:13:29,958
but seriously, why do
you wanna hear it?!

282
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,583
[RIKO]
Heh. The thing is,

283
00:13:32,666 --> 00:13:36,333
I'm composing a song for piano,
but no matter how hard I try

284
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:38,666
I just can't seem to capture
the sounds of the water.

285
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:40,625
Wow! That's so cool!

286
00:13:40,708 --> 00:13:42,916
It's amazing that you
can write your own music!

287
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:45,375
So do you go to
school around here?

288
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,791
Tokyo.

289
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:48,625
[CHIKA] No way. You came here
all the way from Tokyo?

290
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,000
Well, I guess it's complicated.

291
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:52,625
[CHIKA]
Nah, I think that's awesome!

292
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,916
Oh! Do you know any of
the school idols there?

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,333
Did you say school idols?

294
00:13:56,416 --> 00:13:58,958
Yep! Tokyo's supposed to have
a ton of famous groups.

295
00:13:59,041 --> 00:14:00,333
Which one is your favorite?

296
00:14:00,416 --> 00:14:02,166
I'm not following.

297
00:14:02,250 --> 00:14:03,666
Huh?

298
00:14:08,833 --> 00:14:11,666
[yawns]

299
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:13,541
[CHIKA]
You mean you don't know?

300
00:14:13,625 --> 00:14:16,083
School idols are girls
who, well, go to school!

301
00:14:16,166 --> 00:14:19,208
And perform in live competitions
and stuff like that!

302
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:20,583
They're not famous, are they?

303
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:22,916
Oh my gosh, they're
totally famous!

304
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,125
And sometimes if a
group is good enough,

305
00:14:25,208 --> 00:14:27,375
they could even get to
perform at the Dome.

306
00:14:27,458 --> 00:14:28,666
If it makes you feel any better,

307
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,750
I only learned about
all this recently.

308
00:14:30,833 --> 00:14:32,416
Wow, really?

309
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:34,500
I've been so involved
in my piano playing

310
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:36,916
so I guess I never even
knew they existed.

311
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,958
Hey, you wanna see 'em?

312
00:14:39,041 --> 00:14:41,750
They're so cool!
Trust me on this!

313
00:14:41,833 --> 00:14:43,291
Like, you mean watch
them right now?

314
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:44,500
[CHIKA]
Yep, on my phone!

315
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:47,416
[RIKO]
Hm. They're, uh--

316
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:48,750
[CHIKA]
Awesome?

317
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:54,750
I was gonna say, well,
they look kinda... average.

318
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,583
I mean! You know, like
normal in the best way!

319
00:14:57,666 --> 00:15:00,041
I just thought they'd look
more like celebrities

320
00:15:00,125 --> 00:15:02,500
since they're famous
idols and all.

321
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,875
[CHIKA] I agree.

322
00:15:03,958 --> 00:15:05,708
What?

323
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:09,000
I admit, it really
surprised me, too.

325

[CHIKA]
When you talk about piano,

326
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:20,250
I can tell you're super
passionate about it,

327
00:15:20,333 --> 00:15:22,375
to the point where you'd
jump into freezing waters

328
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,625
just to write a song better.

329
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:27,750
To be consumed by
your very passion,

330
00:15:27,833 --> 00:15:30,416
to have a special dream.

331
00:15:43,833 --> 00:15:47,458
I've never had that kind
of feeling before.

332
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:51,500
You know something?

333
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:53,625
I'm normal, too.

334
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:58,125
[CHIKA] If you look up 'normal'
in the dictionary,

335
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:01,000
you'd probably see a picture
of me next to it.

336
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:03,500
No matter what I did,
I never stood out.

337
00:16:03,583 --> 00:16:06,208
To be fair, it never
even really bothered me.

338
00:16:06,291 --> 00:16:09,583
'Cause if everyone is special,
then nobody's special, right?

339
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,125
Time flew by.

340
00:16:11,208 --> 00:16:15,208
Before I knew it, I was in my
second year of high school.

341
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:16,541
Not cool!

342
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,666
I had to act before I became
permanently normal!

343
00:16:18,750 --> 00:16:20,333
I needed to evolve
into Chika-chi,

344
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:23,500
an awesomely normal
monster, and do it soon!

345
00:16:23,583 --> 00:16:25,875
So, roar!

[RIKO laughs]

351
00:16:34,708 --> 00:16:40,000
Then I saw them. On that
day, everything changed.

352
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:48,500
[CHIKA] They were just
average high schoolers,

353
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,125
but when they all worked
together on that stage,

354
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:53,875
they shined like the sun!

355
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:58,916
♪♪♪

356
00:17:06,875 --> 00:17:09,083
And then I began to wonder,

357
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,458
is this something
that I could do, too?

358
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,500
How cool would it be
to stand on that stage

359
00:17:13,583 --> 00:17:15,041
and move as one person?

360
00:17:15,125 --> 00:17:20,000
I wanted to be like them.
They captivated me.

361
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:24,500
They inspired me!

362
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:31,458
I realized school idols were,
well, they were...

363
00:17:31,541 --> 00:17:36,166
They were so... They were so...

364
00:17:36,250 --> 00:17:39,791
They were so incredibly radiant!

365
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,958
[CHIKA] I immediately listened
to all of their songs.

366
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:47,625
I watched every
single video online.

367
00:17:47,708 --> 00:17:49,375
I memorized their lyrics.

368
00:17:49,458 --> 00:17:52,708
I knew I wanted to do this
with my own friends.

369
00:17:52,791 --> 00:17:55,333
I wanted to inspire
others like me.

370
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,750
I felt passionate!

371
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:03,541
But mostly, I learned
that I want to shine!

372
00:18:05,708 --> 00:18:07,750
Thanks a lot.

373

Because your story
is seriously amazing,

374

I'll work hard too.

Wow, really?

Yes.

"That day will definitely come!"

in their song, right?

So there's no way I'm
gonna give up now.

In order to enter Love Live,

434
00:20:24,666 --> 00:20:27,833
you can only compete if you're
using original material,
