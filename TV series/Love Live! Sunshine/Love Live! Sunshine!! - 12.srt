[GIRLS]
<i>Love Live! Sunshine!!</i>

3
00:00:14,041 --> 00:00:15,458
[YOSHIKO]
With the qualifiers looming,

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:18,916
You signed a pact of darkness
and stepped in for Riko.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:20,625
However, doubts
about her friendship

6
00:00:20,708 --> 00:00:22,125
with Chika were sinister.

7
00:00:22,208 --> 00:00:25,666
[YOU] Maybe Chika didn't
want it to be just us two.

8
00:00:25,750 --> 00:00:27,166
[YOSHIKO]
One dark night...

9
00:00:27,250 --> 00:00:29,583
[CHIKA] You don't have to
change your stride or anything,

10
00:00:29,666 --> 00:00:31,625
I figure we can start over
from the beginning.

11
00:00:31,708 --> 00:00:32,958
[YOU]
Oh wow.

12
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:34,750
I'm so...

13
00:00:34,833 --> 00:00:36,083
I'm so dumb!

14
00:00:36,166 --> 00:00:38,458
[YOSHIKO] Now, divine
forces of cosmic influence

15
00:00:38,541 --> 00:00:41,041
will descend upon Love Live!

16
00:00:48,291 --> 00:00:49,416
Still nothing.

17
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,583
[DIA] I cannot believe
they have the nerve

18
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,083
to make us wait like this!

19
00:00:52,166 --> 00:00:54,333
[KANAN]
The suspense is killing me!

20
00:00:54,416 --> 00:00:56,333
[CHIKA]
Don't worry!

21
00:00:56,416 --> 00:00:58,125
[KANAN]
I'm going for a run!

22
00:00:58,208 --> 00:01:00,583
When they post the results,
should I call you?

23
00:01:00,666 --> 00:01:01,875
No thank you!

24
00:01:01,958 --> 00:01:03,208
[CHIKA] That means you'll
have to wait longer!

25
00:01:03,291 --> 00:01:04,625
[gasps]

26
00:01:07,791 --> 00:01:09,791
Slow down or you'll get sick!

27
00:01:09,875 --> 00:01:12,416
[HANAMARU] I can't help it,
food keeps me calm, zura!

28
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:14,625
[YOSHIKO]
Demons, hear my plea!

29
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:16,416
Lend your powers to Yohane!

30
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,791
Send me dark magic
and psychic strength.

31
00:01:18,875 --> 00:01:21,708
Your master calls you!

32
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,000
This is sacred, you know!

33
00:01:25,083 --> 00:01:26,166
[YOU]
It's time!

34
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,583
Okay, here they are...

35
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:30,625
The results of the Love
Live preliminaries!

36
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:33,750
I'm just so nervous!

37
00:01:33,833 --> 00:01:35,375
Let it be an "A" for Aqours.

38
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:36,625
A... A... A!

Liizu Express.

41
00:01:42,291 --> 00:01:42,625
No way.

42
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,250
We lost.

43
00:01:43,333 --> 00:01:45,000
It can't be true!

44
00:01:45,083 --> 00:01:47,625
Oh! They sorted it
by entry number!

45
00:01:47,708 --> 00:01:49,458
[ALL groan]

46
00:01:49,541 --> 00:01:50,750
[CHIKA]
I can't believe you!

47
00:01:50,833 --> 00:01:52,333
[YOU]
Sorry about that!

48
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,666
Let's see...

49
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:57,083
Liizu Express. Green Tears.

50
00:01:57,166 --> 00:02:00,458
Meenana. Aqours.

51
00:02:00,541 --> 00:02:01,500
Aqours!

52
00:02:01,583 --> 00:02:02,916
[DIA]
We did it!

[ALL cheering]

54
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,000
[MARI]
We made it.

55
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:06,583
Love Live...

56
00:02:06,666 --> 00:02:08,291
Oh my god.

57
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:13,333
Oh my god! Oh my god!

58
00:03:44,916 --> 00:03:48,125
[KANAN] How about a celebratory
meal? Enjoy, ladies!

59
00:03:48,208 --> 00:03:50,125
It's the catch of the day!

60
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:52,458
What's special about
having sashimi?

61
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,458
Sorry, I'll do my best to add
steak to the menu next time.

62
00:03:55,541 --> 00:03:58,500
Maybe we can put something
with it, like fresh fruit!

63
00:03:58,583 --> 00:03:59,583
[HANAMARU]
And pastries!

64
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,541
[KANAN]
But we don't have any of that!

65
00:04:01,625 --> 00:04:04,458
[RUBY screaming]
Look at this!

66
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:05,666
[CHIKA]
What's up?

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:08,916
[RUBY] The number of
views on our video!

68
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,750
It's only been up
for a few days!

69
00:04:10,833 --> 00:04:12,375
That's a lot of people!

70
00:04:12,458 --> 00:04:13,875
Even more exciting--

71
00:04:13,958 --> 00:04:16,333
we've got tons of comments too!

72
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:17,541
"How cute!"

73
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,125
"Aqours are dancing
their way to Love Live."

74
00:04:19,208 --> 00:04:20,708
"This is a dark horse."

75
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,958
The dark force?

76
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:24,333
You know, I'm glad we
got more than a zero.

77
00:04:24,416 --> 00:04:25,583
Are you surprised?

78
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,666
Don't forget we did make
it through qualifiers.

79
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,208
[phone ringing]

80
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,000
[BOTH]
Uh?

81
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:32,291
[CHIKA]
Huh? It's Riko.

82
00:04:33,125 --> 00:04:36,541
[RIKO] Congratulations on
getting through the prelims!

83
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:39,291
[CHIKA]
How'd your competition go?

84
00:04:39,375 --> 00:04:41,208
[RIKO]
Everything went great.

85
00:04:41,291 --> 00:04:42,916
I played the piece I wrote.

86
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,166
It felt wonderful!

87
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:47,416
That's amazing.

88
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,333
Hey! Next time there
will be nine of us.

89
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,208
We're gonna be at Love
Live all together!

90
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:56,083
Ah! You're right!

91
00:04:56,166 --> 00:04:57,375
Can't wait.

92
00:04:57,458 --> 00:04:58,791
See you soon!

93
00:04:58,875 --> 00:05:00,250
[ALL laugh]

94
00:05:00,333 --> 00:05:03,041
There's more. Love Live will
give us the fame we need!

95
00:05:03,125 --> 00:05:05,250
We can easily save the
school if we do...

96
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:06,791
...our Rubesty!

97
00:05:06,875 --> 00:05:09,208
All it'll be perfect timing
considering the open house

98
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:10,166
we have coming up!

99
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,250
I didn't know about that!

100
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:14,875
<i>Si</i> , it'll be held in
September this year!

101
00:05:14,958 --> 00:05:16,791
Now that we've passed
the qualifiers,

102
00:05:16,875 --> 00:05:19,625
there's no doubt our school
has gained some notoriety.

103
00:05:19,708 --> 00:05:20,875
<i>Corretta</i> !

104
00:05:20,958 --> 00:05:22,500
Considering the number
of views on our video,

105
00:05:22,583 --> 00:05:24,708
I wouldn't be surprised
if dozens of students

106
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:27,541
applied for the open
house, you know...?

107
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:29,708
[ALL]
Uh?

108
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,541
[MARI]
Zero.

109
00:05:30,625 --> 00:05:31,541
[DIA]
Uh?

110
00:05:31,625 --> 00:05:33,041
It says... zero.

111
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,166
No way!

112
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,208
[DIA]
You have to be joking, right?

113
00:05:36,291 --> 00:05:37,083
Zero.

114
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,458
[YOU]
Not even one person?

115
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:44,291
[CHIKA sighs]

116
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,375
We got another zero.

117
00:05:46,458 --> 00:05:48,625
I wonder if the number
of admissions applicants

118
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,125
will be different though.

119
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:53,208
No clue. I thought we were
starting to get popular.

120
00:05:53,291 --> 00:05:56,333
We ran into people
who recognized us.

121
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,208
Oh, wow!

122
00:05:57,291 --> 00:05:59,291
You're Kanan from Aqours, right?

123
00:05:59,375 --> 00:06:00,250
Uh...

124
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:02,250
It really is you!

125
00:06:02,333 --> 00:06:04,000
Can I have your
autograph? Please?

126
00:06:04,083 --> 00:06:05,208
[KANAN]
Autograph?

127
00:06:05,291 --> 00:06:06,833
Are you sure you've got
the right person?

128
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:08,500
Full speed ahead, matey!

129
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:10,333
Heh... Aye aye, Cap'n!

130
00:06:10,416 --> 00:06:12,333
Please! Just one little picture?

131
00:06:12,416 --> 00:06:13,083
[RUBY screams]

132
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,916
Stop right there.

133
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,250
Now then,

134
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:19,000
how would you like to take
a photo with me instead?

135
00:06:19,083 --> 00:06:21,000
[AQOURS FAN 12C]
Uh. Do I know you?

136
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:25,625
[DIA]
Uh! I'm a school idol too!

137
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:28,250
Is our 15 minutes
of fame up already?

138
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,708
If it makes you feel any better,
I don't think Dia ever got hers.

139
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:35,000
I'm lost. What'll we do
if no new students apply?

140
00:06:35,083 --> 00:06:36,583
Out of ideas here.

141
00:06:36,666 --> 00:06:37,625
Me too.

142
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,250
I thought we'd be farther along.

143
00:06:39,333 --> 00:06:41,333
Otonokizaka was as good
as saved by this point.

144
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,500
[gasps] Are you sure about that?

145
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:48,083
[YOU] Mm-hm. It was pretty much
decided it would stay open.

146
00:06:48,166 --> 00:06:50,208
Wow. Guess we're behind.

147
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,625
[KANAN] Some things
are out of our control.

148
00:06:52,708 --> 00:06:55,125
If anything, this is a
testament to how tough it is

149
00:06:55,208 --> 00:06:56,875
to be a school idol
where we live.

150
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,916
There's gotta be more to it.

151
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,041
No one applied.

152
00:07:00,125 --> 00:07:02,083
We can't be too hard
on ourselves.

153
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,833
There are so many
people in Tokyo,

154
00:07:03,916 --> 00:07:06,083
you can always expect
at least one.

155
00:07:06,166 --> 00:07:08,000
It's different here.

156
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:15,791
Maybe, but I don't feel right
using that as an excuse.

157
00:07:15,875 --> 00:07:17,458
Chika...

158
00:07:18,583 --> 00:07:19,291
Uh?

159
00:07:19,375 --> 00:07:20,791
There has to be a way!

160
00:07:20,875 --> 00:07:24,333
We didn't come this far as
school idols to give up now!

161
00:07:25,208 --> 00:07:28,416
Chika! If you eat it that
fast, you'll get-- Huh?!

162
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,250
Chika!

163
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:33,541
[CHIKA] I need to be

[YOU, KANAN laugh]

167
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:58,000
[CHIKA] Mu's would've already
saved their school by now.

168
00:07:58,083 --> 00:08:02,250
I always thought that they
weren't very different from me.

169
00:08:02,333 --> 00:08:04,666
They seemed like normal people
who were trying their best

170
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,375
to shine for the world.

171
00:08:06,458 --> 00:08:08,791
And a part of me hoped
that I could do that too.

172
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:11,625
Mu's inspired me.

173
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:13,666
What makes them so special?

174
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:17,791
Maybe they had a better leader.

175
00:08:17,875 --> 00:08:20,666
If you keep talking to yourself
people will think you're nuts.

I can't figure out
what to do next.

Hey. Are you okay?

178
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:30,833
What's the point of
feeling sorry for myself?

179
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,041
I'm gonna go!

Where?

181
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:35,583
Uh? How long have you
been standing there?

182
00:08:35,666 --> 00:08:38,416
Really. It took you that long?

Yeah! Let's do it!

185
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:45,375
I have to figure out what makes
Mu's different than our group.

186
00:08:45,458 --> 00:08:47,666
They were able to
save Otonokizaka.

187
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,166
That's incredible!

188

What was so special about them?

189
00:08:51,583 --> 00:08:53,125
We could go back to
where they started

190
00:08:53,208 --> 00:08:55,708
and really think about it.

191
00:08:55,791 --> 00:08:57,250
I think it's a good idea.

Splendid. Once more, Yohane
descends upon that city of sin.

scares her so much?

out above other groups.

This was... Mu's school.

327
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,875
They loved this place,
and saved it.

They entered Love Live...

demonic presence?

Cut it out, zura.

we could take a look around.

Oh, sure!

337
00:14:54,791 --> 00:14:56,750
You wouldn't happen to be
school idols, would you?

338
00:14:56,833 --> 00:14:59,000
Uh, yeah! We're fans of Mu's.

339
00:14:59,083 --> 00:15:01,250
We came here to learn
more about them.

340

Of course!

341
00:15:02,416 --> 00:15:03,958
I'm not surprised.

Welcome. A lot of
idols come here.

find what you're looking for.

[CHIKA]
Huh?

345
00:15:12,416 --> 00:15:15,416
They really loved it here,
but the members of Mu's

346
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:18,250
didn't leave anything behind.

347
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:19,791
All the awards they won,

348
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:23,833
the trophies, the ribbons,
their records...

349
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,625
They said their hearts
would be connected,

350
00:15:25,708 --> 00:15:27,916
even without those things.

351
00:15:29,750 --> 00:15:32,750
That's the way Mu's wanted it.

You might fall
and hurt yourself!

Figure out what
made Mu's special?

363

Well... Coming here
gave me some clues.

How do you feel?

I'm... glad I came here.

It's nice. I liked
this school a lot.

Fallen Angel. Stigma.

Did we accomplish anything
by going to Tokyo?

I'm not sure.

What was it that
made Mu's great?

377

There was something that
made them different.

I'm not sure if we'll
ever have an answer.

What should we do
once we <i>ritorno</i> ?

380
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:12,166
I guess... we should focus
on saving the school.

Winning Love Live
can't be all it takes.

I think... we aren't
going to be like them.

There's no point in chasing
after Mu's, or Love Live,

or that shining feeling.

407

Well, I think she means
we move forward.

411

It isn't about being number one,

or beating the other
school idols.

413

Mu's had greatness
in spite of all that.

Yep. And they were so wonderful

'cause they did a
brand new thing.

They weren't afraid
to pave the way.

417
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,583
Mu's worked hard to make
their dreams a reality!

418
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:04,458
They were free and
true to themselves.

419
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:07,833
Mu's didn't follow,
they tried things,

420
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:11,000
and that's why they could fly!

421
00:19:11,083 --> 00:19:14,291
To shine like Mu's we have to
stop living in their shadow.

00:19:14,375 --> 00:19:17,291
It's time for us to
spread our own wings.

We have to run into the unknown
with our heads held high!

424
00:19:20,958 --> 00:19:23,500
It's time for us to
figure out who we are!

425
00:19:23,583 --> 00:19:27,375
If we put our hearts into it,
nothing will hold us back!

426
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:31,291
Just watch! We'll create
our own miracles!

427
00:19:31,375 --> 00:19:32,291
We'll be free.

staying true to who we are.

But wait, if we run
without a direction

434
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,333
won't we separate
from each other?

[CHIKA] Dear Honoka, I love
Mu's with all my heart.

462
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,500
When I saw your group,
all these normal girls

463
00:20:58,583 --> 00:21:01,125
doing amazing things
and shining bright,

464
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:04,208
I started wondering if
I could be that way.

465
00:21:04,291 --> 00:21:07,583
I wanted to be a
leader like you.

466
00:21:07,666 --> 00:21:09,416
But it's so clear now.

467
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,166
I'm okay the way I am.

468
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:14,000
If I look at all the
friends I've made

469
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:15,750
and all the things around me,

470
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:17,916
I feel good about the future.

471
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,083
I'll keep running without fear.

472
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:22,125
That's what Mu's represents.

473
00:21:22,208 --> 00:21:25,541
That's what it means to shine.

474

place in the world.

that's not what you want.
