3
00:00:14,125 --> 00:00:16,083
[YOSHIKO] Would you like
to descend with me?

4
00:00:16,166 --> 00:00:17,875
[HANAMARU] Yoshiko had
a hard time gettin' rid of

5
00:00:17,958 --> 00:00:19,166
her Yohane persona!

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:20,333
[CHIKA]
I found it!

7
00:00:20,416 --> 00:00:21,916
[HANAMARU]
Then Chika suggested that Aqours

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,416
become fallen angel idols
so we'd stand out.

9
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:26,250
[DIA]
It's disgusting!

10
00:00:26,333 --> 00:00:28,666
[HANAMARU] We had to go
back to the drawing board.

11
00:00:28,750 --> 00:00:30,166
[YOSHIKO] I should've
dropped this whole act.

12
00:00:30,250 --> 00:00:32,708
[HANAMARU] But Chika and
Yoshiko had a little talk.

13
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:34,416
[CHIKA]
'Cause the most important thing

14
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,875
is to show your favorite self!

15
00:00:35,958 --> 00:00:38,666
Your shining self!
Don't let it go!

16
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:40,375
[HANAMARU]
And then...

17
00:00:41,208 --> 00:00:43,416
[DIA]
Explain yourself now!

18
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,166
There's nothing more I can say.

19
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:47,333
Uranohoshi High School
is gonna close down,

20
00:00:47,416 --> 00:00:50,416
and the students will go
to a school in Numazu.

21
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:52,250
I thought you already knew.

22
00:00:52,333 --> 00:00:54,458
I heard, but nothing
was certain.

23
00:00:54,541 --> 00:00:56,000
[MARI]
That's right.

24
00:00:56,083 --> 00:00:59,208
It's not exactly a done deal.
I keep pushing them to wait,

25
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,166
but there's only
so much I can do.

26
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:02,541
And why would you care?

27
00:01:02,625 --> 00:01:04,041
I think you already
know that I have

28
00:01:04,125 --> 00:01:06,666
my own personal reasons for
becoming the director here.

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:08,416
[DIA]
Uh...

30
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:10,791
I'm not going to
lose this school.

31
00:01:10,875 --> 00:01:13,333
No matter what.

32
00:01:13,416 --> 00:01:15,458
It's important to me.

33
00:01:15,541 --> 00:01:18,666
More than any other
place in the world.

34
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,833
[DIA] I hope you have
a strategy in mind.

35
00:01:21,916 --> 00:01:23,166
Did you realize that every year

36
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:26,041
we have fewer and fewer
applicants enrolling here?

37
00:01:26,125 --> 00:01:29,041
And that's exactly why we
need the School Idol Club.

38
00:01:29,125 --> 00:01:30,541
You're serious?

39
00:01:30,625 --> 00:01:33,416
I said it back then, didn't I?

40
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,625
I never believed in giving up.

41
00:01:35,708 --> 00:01:36,875
Even now.

42
00:01:36,958 --> 00:01:40,541
I know there's a chance
to turn things around.

43
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,291
It'll be fine.

44
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:45,875
I'll find my own way to keep
the school from closing.

45

[door opens, closes]

46

[YOSHIKO]
Can you believe it?

49
00:03:29,041 --> 00:03:31,125
It was super annoying!
Don't you think?

50
00:03:31,208 --> 00:03:33,125
We all agree! Right?

51
00:03:33,208 --> 00:03:34,208
It so was!

52
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,000
Have a good day!

53
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,458
Bye-bye, new best friends!

[STUDENT 5A]
Yoshiko is so funny!

55
00:03:37,875 --> 00:03:39,375
[STUDENT 5C]
I know!

56
00:03:39,458 --> 00:03:41,083
Well, that was tiring.

57
00:03:41,166 --> 00:03:44,000
Uh! It shouldn't be
this hard to be normal!

58
00:03:44,083 --> 00:03:45,416
Like we've been sayin',

59
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,541
you don't gotta force yourself
to be ordinary, zura!

Bad news! I have bad news!

68
00:04:00,875 --> 00:04:02,166
[HANAMARU]
What's the matter?

69
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,583
It's terrible!
Our school is gonna be--

70
00:04:04,666 --> 00:04:06,541
[ALL]
Combined and shut down?!

71
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:09,083
[RUBY]
Mm! That's what's going around.

72
00:04:09,166 --> 00:04:11,458
We'll have to merge with
a school in Numazu.

73
00:04:11,541 --> 00:04:14,000
So we might as well kiss
Uranohoshi goodbye.

74
00:04:14,083 --> 00:04:15,208
It can't be!

75
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:16,708
When?

76
00:04:16,791 --> 00:04:20,458
Well, that still depends on next
year's enrollment numbers.

77
00:04:20,541 --> 00:04:21,958
If there aren't enough
new students,

78
00:04:22,041 --> 00:04:25,041
they'll have no choice
but to close down.

79
00:04:27,708 --> 00:04:29,000
Close down?

80
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,125
[RIKO, YOU gasp]

00:04:30,208 --> 00:04:31,041
This is it!

00:04:31,125 --> 00:04:32,375
Our time has finally come!

83
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:35,041
Sounds to me like Uranohoshi
is on its last leg!

84
00:04:35,125 --> 00:04:37,208
I'd say our school's in
desperate need of saving!

85
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,208
Are you okay?

86
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:39,583
I think you need to sit down.

87
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:41,416
Yoo-hoo! Earth to Chika.

88
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,916
What are you so happy about?

89
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,083
[CHIKA] I can't believe
this is happening!

90
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,833
Our school is shutting down!

91
00:04:48,916 --> 00:04:50,458
It's just like Otonokizaka!

92
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,625
Oh, yeah!

93
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:55,916
[CHIKA grunts] The stage
has been set perfectly!

94
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,458
We'll work together
and save our school!

95
00:04:58,541 --> 00:05:00,583
And we're going to shine!

96
00:05:00,666 --> 00:05:03,833
Like Mu's! They'll
be our guiding light.

97
00:05:03,916 --> 00:05:06,750
You can't really think
it's going to be that easy.

98
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:09,000
How do you feel, Hanamaru?

99
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:11,041
[HANAMARU]
We'll be combined and shut down!

100
00:05:11,125 --> 00:05:12,375
[RUBY]
Not you too!

101
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:13,958
You're tellin' me that if
this place has to close,

102
00:05:14,041 --> 00:05:15,625
we'll go to school
in Numazu, zura?

103
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:17,750
We could officially call
ourselves city girls!

104
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:19,708
Right, yeah...

105
00:05:19,791 --> 00:05:20,833
[HANAMARU sighs]

106
00:05:20,916 --> 00:05:23,000
That's just like her.
Good grief.

107
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:25,125
Zuramaru has always
been like this.

108
00:05:25,208 --> 00:05:26,791
No way.

109
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,166
[gasps] It's the future, zura!

110
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,083
[YOSHIKO]
Huh...?

111
00:05:37,166 --> 00:05:39,083
I guess it makes sense.

112
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,666
Well, what about you, Yoshiko?

113
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:43,833
I, for one, think closing this
place down is a terrific idea!

114
00:05:43,916 --> 00:05:45,625
In the big city there
will be tons of students

115
00:05:45,708 --> 00:05:47,958
who are up to date with
the latest trends, like me!

116
00:05:48,041 --> 00:05:49,708
Oh, that's wonderful to hear!

117
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:51,500
Think of all your old friends
from middle school!

118
00:05:51,583 --> 00:05:53,041
You can reconnect!

119
00:05:53,125 --> 00:05:55,500
[YOSHIKO] I meant to say I'm
completely against combining!

120
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:56,541
[ALL]
Uh?

121
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,125
[CHIKA]
Listen up!

122
00:05:58,208 --> 00:06:00,291
We now know that our treasured
house of learning is in danger

123
00:06:00,375 --> 00:06:04,500
of closing. So Aqours
will take swift action...

124
00:06:04,583 --> 00:06:06,708
...to save the school!

125
00:06:06,791 --> 00:06:10,083
[YOU]
Uh... Full speed ahead!

126
00:06:10,166 --> 00:06:11,916
Let's perform a rescue mission!

127
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,250
Yeah, you have our attention,
so tell us your plan!

128
00:06:16,333 --> 00:06:17,166
Huh?

129
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:18,458
[ALL]
What?

130
00:06:18,541 --> 00:06:21,250
[yawns]

131
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:22,375
[CHIKA]
All righty!

132
00:06:22,458 --> 00:06:23,583
I did some research,

133
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,375
and all Mu's had to do
was form their group

134
00:06:25,458 --> 00:06:29,333
and register for their
ranking as school idols.

135
00:06:29,416 --> 00:06:34,166
They performed together at Love
Live, and then got super famous.

136
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:36,291
Do all that and
the school is saved.

137
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,416
[YOU]
Oh, is that it?

138
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,208
[CHIKA]
I think so.

139
00:06:39,291 --> 00:06:41,125
Except...

140
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:46,416
The number of students taking
the entry exam keeps decreasing.

141
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:47,583
[knocking]

142
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,916
Uh! Come in.

143
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,833
Hey Sis, got a sec?

144
00:06:52,916 --> 00:06:54,333
[DIA]
Is something the matter?

145
00:06:54,416 --> 00:06:55,833
Not really.

146
00:06:55,916 --> 00:06:57,958
I wanted to let you know I might
be running a little late.

147
00:06:58,041 --> 00:06:58,958
[DIA]
Again?

148
00:06:59,041 --> 00:07:00,958
Yeah. Chika thinks
that if our club

149
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:03,666
made a promo video it might
inspire some new applicants

150
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,250
to come to our school next year.

151
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:09,583
[DIA]
Thank you for telling me.

152
00:07:09,666 --> 00:07:10,458
[gasps]

153
00:07:10,541 --> 00:07:11,666
I'll let mother and father know

154
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,125
that you won't be
home for dinner.

155
00:07:13,208 --> 00:07:14,333
You don't mind?

156
00:07:14,416 --> 00:07:15,416
Thank you so much!

157
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:16,583
[DIA]
It's fine.

158
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:18,416
Just make sure you're
home before dark.

159
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:20,875
Right! Gotta run, see ya later!

160
00:07:20,958 --> 00:07:22,125
How is it?

161
00:07:22,208 --> 00:07:24,583
Being a school idol.

162
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:26,250
It's a lot of hard work,

163
00:07:26,333 --> 00:07:27,666
but I'm having fun.

164
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,541
Oh.

165
00:07:29,625 --> 00:07:32,458
[RUBY] Where are the other
student council members?

166
00:07:32,541 --> 00:07:33,666
[DIA]
Their schedules are full

167
00:07:33,750 --> 00:07:35,541
because they're all
involved in other clubs.

168
00:07:35,625 --> 00:07:37,333
Too bad.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:40,791
Would you--

170
00:07:40,875 --> 00:07:42,000
Well, you'd better get going.

171
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:44,125
Uh...

172
00:07:44,208 --> 00:07:46,291
[DIA]
You wouldn't want to be late.

173
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,583
[RIKO]
Cool things about Uchiura?

174
00:07:55,666 --> 00:07:56,375
That's right!

175
00:07:56,458 --> 00:07:57,708
This town is so rinky-dink

176
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,791
most people probably don't
know anything about it!

177
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:01,958
So we'll make a video that
tells them all the great stuff

178
00:08:02,041 --> 00:08:02,958
we have going on!

179
00:08:03,041 --> 00:08:04,041
[YOSHIKO]
So we're filming a PV?

180
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:06,333
Yup! Mu's did something
like this, too.

181
00:08:06,416 --> 00:08:09,250
We'll make it look awesome here
and post it for everyone to see!

182
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,875
The sea of knowledge, zura?

183
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,166
Well, whaddaya think?

184
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:14,250
Everybody's gonna love it!

185
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:17,500
[gasps] I don't know what to
say to that camera thingy!

186
00:08:17,583 --> 00:08:18,708
I can't do it!

187
00:08:18,791 --> 00:08:20,625
[RUBY whimpering]

188
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:24,500
[YOU]
Mm... Where'd she go?

189
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:27,458
[YOSHIKO]
I predict she's in the tree!

190
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:29,708
[ALL gasp]

191
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,875
[RUBY]
Crazy! I can't get up that tree!

192
00:08:31,958 --> 00:08:32,500
[YOU]
Ha!

193
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:33,833
[RUBY shrieks]

194
00:08:33,916 --> 00:08:36,333
Wow! That was amazing!
Can we see it again?

195
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,291
We don't have the time
for that right now!

196
00:08:41,958 --> 00:08:42,958
Check out that view!

197
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:46,750
Mt. Fuji looks so
awesome from here!

198
00:08:46,833 --> 00:08:51,000
And what do you think about
this shimmering ocean, huh?

199
00:08:51,083 --> 00:08:52,500
Guess what else?

200
00:08:52,583 --> 00:08:54,791
Our mandarin oranges are yummy!

201
00:08:54,875 --> 00:08:56,833
If you walk into
town we have a--

202
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:58,708
In the town we have a lot of...

203
00:08:58,791 --> 00:09:03,291
Uh... We have a lot
of nothing at all!

204
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:05,041
[YOU]
You can't tell them that.

205
00:09:05,125 --> 00:09:07,833
[CHIKA sighs]
Okay.

206
00:09:07,916 --> 00:09:09,791
You can even visit the big city!

207
00:09:09,875 --> 00:09:11,291
Just a bus ride away!

208
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,791
While you're at it check out
some of the great stores!

209
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:18,291
And there's more... nearby!

210
00:09:18,375 --> 00:09:19,833
[RIKO]
Have some money to spend?

211
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,750
If you bike ride over
the big hill you'll find

212
00:09:21,833 --> 00:09:25,125
the exhilarating Izu shopping
arcade, a great time waster.

213
00:09:25,208 --> 00:09:27,625
Good grief. Gettin' here
wasn't easy at all.

214
00:09:27,708 --> 00:09:32,208
And it would take a person
500 yen to get to Numazu by bus!

215
00:09:32,291 --> 00:09:37,500
[YOSHIKO groans]
This isn't working out!

216
00:09:37,583 --> 00:09:41,041
[CHIKA]
Mm... You're up.

217
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:44,125
[YOSHIKO chuckles]
Greetings, little demons.

218
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:46,583
It is I, fallen angel Yohane.

219
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,708
Now then, allow me
to familiarize you

220
00:09:48,791 --> 00:09:50,916
with the earth upon
which I have landed!

221
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,166
The first thrilling feature?

222
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,291
This dirt!

00:09:54,375 --> 00:09:55,958
[laughs]

224
00:09:56,041 --> 00:09:57,500
I just love it when Yoshiko

225
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:59,541
shares her true self
with the world!

226
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:02,583
Uh. Maybe we should think
about taking this whole video

227
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,750
in a different direction.

228
00:10:03,833 --> 00:10:05,625
Aw! But this is funny!

229
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,500
[RIKO] But it's not
supposed to be funny!

[WAITRESS 6A]
Here you are, ladies!

232
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:12,125
Been a while since we've
had such a big group.

233
00:10:12,208 --> 00:10:15,250
Let us know if there's
anything you need!

234
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:18,333
Why did we come to a café?

235
00:10:18,416 --> 00:10:20,166
I hope your family
didn't get angry

236
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,458
'cause we got too loud
last time we were there.

237
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:23,708
[CHIKA] Not at all!

238
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:25,625
We came here 'cause Riko
doesn't wanna come in

239
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,958
if Shiitake's roaming around.

240
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,833
I never said I didn't
want to come in!

241
00:10:28,916 --> 00:10:31,166
I just suggested you keep
your dog on a leash!

242
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,166
Do I have to?

243
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,625
That's how it is.

244
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,458
Most people think of their
pets as part of the family,

245
00:10:35,541 --> 00:10:36,375
is that so weird?

246
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,333
I don't get it.

You're afraid of
little dogs, too?

[RIKO]
It's not the size!

255
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:53,750
It's the fangs
that freak me out!

Are you done yet?

271
00:11:19,541 --> 00:11:23,583
Well, I've done some simple
editing. This was tough.

272
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:26,375
But really we don't have
much to work with.

273
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:30,208
Only filming around here makes
things difficult, I guess.

274
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,875
As a last resort we could
always add a few shots

[CHIKA]
It was just a thought!

I don't think Riko trusts those
bright ideas of yours anymore.

Come on, Hanamaru,
finish dessert on the way!

293
00:12:11,125 --> 00:12:12,458
[CHIKA]
Can I admit something?

294
00:12:12,541 --> 00:12:14,333
Showing people how great
it is around here

295
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,708
is harder than I thought.

296
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,250
[RIKO] The video was a nice
idea, but our small town

297
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,791
might be hard to appreciate
through a computer screen.

298
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,041
[CHIKA]
Yeah.

299
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,125
I want to try it though.
If we lose our school,

300
00:12:24,208 --> 00:12:27,375
it would be a lot tougher for
all of us to hang out like this.

301
00:12:27,458 --> 00:12:29,958
You're probably right.

302
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:34,333
[CHIKA] As school idols,
we really need to work hard.

303
00:12:34,416 --> 00:12:36,583
[RIKO]
I thought we did.

304
00:12:36,666 --> 00:12:40,000
You're right about that.
But you know what?

305
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:42,041
I just realized something.

306
00:12:42,125 --> 00:12:45,000
This is important to me!

00:12:45,083 --> 00:12:46,291
I love it.

308
00:12:46,375 --> 00:12:49,708
I don't want to
let our school go!

309
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:53,583
[laughs] Me either!

You should totally tell me
the next time you visit.

The masters of the house tend
to get a little <i>irritata</i>

313
00:13:04,291 --> 00:13:06,875
if someone comes
in without asking.

314
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,416
Our school's
being shut down?

315
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:10,666
No it's not. Well, not yet.

316
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:12,708
But there's work to be done.

317
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,750
We have to take action.

318
00:13:14,833 --> 00:13:17,916
And that's why I need
you to fight again.

319
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,333
Do you?

320
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:27,750
You should never underestimate
