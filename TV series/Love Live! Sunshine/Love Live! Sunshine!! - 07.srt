to save our school

00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:20,416

[CHIKA] We have a lot
of nothing at all!

[DIA] But they struggled
with highlighting our town

and school's best features.

00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:27,708
[MARI] Putting in a lot of
effort isn't gonna be enough!

10
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,458

So they kept searching.

11

[RIKO] I can't believe
we didn't see it.

12
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:35,083
Maybe this is what makes our
school and town so special.

[CHIKA]
That's it!

With that realization,

Aqours took a big step
toward helping our school.

16

Did you just say our video
has 50 thousand views?

17
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:46,833
Whoa, for real?

18
00:00:46,916 --> 00:00:48,208
Yeah, a lot of people
are talking about

Awesome, this is awesome!

25

Those rankings are for
the entire country, right?

You're telling me that
out of over 5,000

00:01:05,916 --> 00:01:08,083

we're in the top 100?

28
00:01:08,166 --> 00:01:10,375
Normally I wouldn't want to
get excited over a temporary

29
00:01:10,458 --> 00:01:12,916
boost in our position,
but it's pretty amazing!

And get this--in improved
ranking, we're first!

Really? That's so cool!

32
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:20,875
You know what? If things
keep going like this,

33
00:01:20,958 --> 00:01:22,916
we could even be the
champions of Love Live!

34
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,250
You think so?

35
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,291
Somehow I get the feeling
it won't be that easy.

I didn't say it would be,
but at least we know

And they'd like us

I understand. So this is
an official event, then?

Mm-hm.

These kind of trips can
be expensive, you know?

Becoming a school idol is a

What are you doing, Mari?

88
00:05:05,791 --> 00:05:07,958
This isn't a game.
You know what it means

89
00:05:08,041 --> 00:05:10,416
to allow these girls to go
to Tokyo for this event.

90

[MARI] You could totally
stop them and stuff.

91
00:05:12,916 --> 00:05:14,791
Just bear in mind that
if you do keep them

92
00:05:14,875 --> 00:05:15,958
from performing in Tokyo,

93
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,833
they just might quit
trying all together.

94
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:20,208
I mean, don't you want
them to succeed?

95
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:23,416
Want them to overcome the
obstacles that we could not?

96
00:05:23,500 --> 00:05:25,833
Want them to be <i>vittorioso</i> ?

Sure, but what happens if
they aren't successful?

99
00:05:29,625 --> 00:05:31,708
What if they all fail instead?

100
00:05:31,791 --> 00:05:33,041
If that were to happen,

101
00:05:33,125 --> 00:05:34,958
those girls would be haunted
by their inadequacy.

102
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,125
It's a possibility,

103
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,291
but not something they
can totally avoid.

104
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,291
If they're serious about
being school idols

and saving the school,

106
00:05:41,583 --> 00:05:43,750
then they have to give
it their best shot.

Can you keep it down?
I can't concentrate over here!

323

Whatever, zura!

Here goes!

[GIRLS chattering]

00:15:26,875 --> 00:15:30,875
[RUBY] Okay then. I'm just gonna
start laying the futons.

[CHIKA] Hey! Listen, I talked to
the innkeeper and you... huh?

330
00:15:41,625 --> 00:15:44,083
[YOU]
Otonokizaka. Mu's' school?

331
00:15:44,166 --> 00:15:46,500
[CHIKA] Yeah, and it turns
out they're close by!

00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:47,291
Hey, Riko!

333
00:15:47,375 --> 00:15:48,416
[RIKO]
Uh?

334
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,833
What do you say?
Wanna go check it out?

Uh...

Ah, come on!
It'll be so awesome!

339
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,333
It's something I've
always wanted to see!

340
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:58,625
This is the high school
Mu's kept alive!

341
00:15:58,708 --> 00:16:00,250
Where they practiced
all their routines!

342
00:16:00,333 --> 00:16:02,208
[RUBY]
Sounds fun, I wanna go too!

343
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,375
[YOU]
Aye aye, count me in!

344
00:16:03,458 --> 00:16:05,250
[HANAMARU]
Isn't Tokyo dangerous at night?

345
00:16:05,333 --> 00:16:07,125
[CHIKA] Dangerous how?
Are there ninjas?

346
00:16:07,208 --> 00:16:08,916
[HANAMARU]
Yoshiko is shaking with fear!

347
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,500
[YOSHIKO]
I am not!

348
00:16:10,583 --> 00:16:12,583
Sorry! I'll pass this time.

349
00:16:12,666 --> 00:16:13,833
[ALL]
Why?

350
00:16:13,916 --> 00:16:16,666
[RIKO] I'm going to bed.
But you girls have fun.

351
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,791
Okay then...

352
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:24,500
You know what? We should, too.

353
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:28,291
[RUBY] You're right. We have
a show tomorrow, after all.

354
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:39,583
[YOSHIKO grunting]

355
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:40,791
[RIKO]
Uh?

356
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,583
Yohane has descended.

357
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:44,208
[RIKO laughs]

358
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:46,333
[CHIKA]
Having trouble sleeping?

359
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,916
Yes, and you?

360
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,583
Yeah, a little.

361
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:54,041
I'm sorry.

362
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:56,625
You know, for bringing
the room down earlier.

363
00:16:56,708 --> 00:17:01,708
[CHIKA] Mm-mm! It's not
your fault. It's mine.

364
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:05,916
Otonokizaka High. You could
say they're pretty famous

365
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:08,541
when it comes to their
musical programs.

366
00:17:08,625 --> 00:17:10,875
Maybe it's because back when
I was in middle school

367
00:17:10,958 --> 00:17:13,333
I had competed
nationally for piano.

368
00:17:13,416 --> 00:17:14,541
But when I entered high school

369
00:17:14,625 --> 00:17:16,791
there were some big
expectations for me.

370
00:17:16,875 --> 00:17:18,333
[CHIKA]
Wow, really?

371
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,958
[RIKO] I don't hate my
old school or anything.

372
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,625
I just practiced constantly.

373
00:17:23,708 --> 00:17:28,333
I felt like I had to live up
to those expectations.

374
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:31,958
And then I didn't do so hot
during the last competition.

375
00:17:32,041 --> 00:17:34,041
[CHIKA]
Living up to expectations...

376
00:17:34,125 --> 00:17:35,541
It's kind of nerve wracking.

377
00:17:35,625 --> 00:17:36,791
[RIKO]
Huh?

378
00:17:36,875 --> 00:17:38,125
When we left Numazu,

379
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:40,750
and all of our friends
came to wish us luck,

380
00:17:40,833 --> 00:17:43,833
I was super happy they came,
but also kinds scared.

381
00:17:43,916 --> 00:17:46,458
I know they're all
cheering for us.

382
00:17:46,541 --> 00:17:49,041
I really don't want to
let any of them down.

I can't fail.

384
00:17:51,250 --> 00:17:53,000
Oh, Chika...

385
00:17:54,041 --> 00:17:54,833
[CHIKA]
I'm sorry!

386
00:17:54,916 --> 00:17:56,000
Uh?

387
00:17:56,083 --> 00:17:58,541
I didn't mean to just
ramble on and on.

Mm-mm. I'm glad you did.

leave us behind or anything.

The ranking?

425
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:35,833
[EVENT STAFF 7A]
Yes, that's correct.

426
00:20:35,916 --> 00:20:38,375
This year, we decided to base
the ranking of the show's idols

427
00:20:38,458 --> 00:20:41,083
off the votes we receive from
everyone in the audience.

428
00:20:41,166 --> 00:20:42,666
So if you're near the top,

then I guess you have a chance
of getting famous even faster?

Yeah, I suppose.
