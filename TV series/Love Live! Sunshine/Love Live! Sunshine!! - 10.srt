[MARI]
Kanan returned to school,

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,833
but things got a
little complicated.

5
00:00:16,916 --> 00:00:18,208
[MARI]
Welcome back!

6
00:00:18,291 --> 00:00:20,125
[MARI] Even though she
was there with us again,

7
00:00:20,208 --> 00:00:21,875
she refused to join Aqours!

8
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:23,875
[DIA] It wasn't that
Kanan couldn't sing

9
00:00:23,958 --> 00:00:25,833
and she didn't freeze up either.

10
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:27,375
Her acts were intentional.

11
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:30,041
[MARI] Turns out, she was only
trying to be a good friend.

12
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,958
[KANAN]
Hug me.

13
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:35,375
Hug me.

14
00:00:35,458 --> 00:00:36,958
[MARI]
We worked things out,

15
00:00:37,041 --> 00:00:40,583
and just like that Aqours had
a full group with nine members!

It's so hot!

[RUBY]
It might make you feel better

26
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:47,000
if you changed out
of the black cape.

27
00:02:47,083 --> 00:02:48,916
[YOU] Is there a reason you
wanted to meet during

28
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,083
the hottest part of the day?

29
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,666
Well, today marks the
beginning of summer vacation!

30
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:55,958
And, like, everyone here
should know what that means!

You! Tell us now!

00:02:57,291 --> 00:02:59,791
[CHIKA gasping]
We all get to go to the beach?

33
00:02:59,875 --> 00:03:01,375
Is that right?

34
00:03:01,458 --> 00:03:03,625
Summer vacation means my papa
will be on his way home soon!

35
00:03:03,708 --> 00:03:05,791
I visit my granny
during the summer.

Eh! Eh! You're wrong!

39
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:14,416
I can't believe you
have the nerve

40
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,083
to call yourselves school idols!

41
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:19,791
Your lack of knowledge is
completely unacceptable!

42
00:03:21,416 --> 00:03:23,791
Okay, we're not getting it.
What's going on in the summer?

43
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,791
I'm still shocked
you don't know.

44
00:03:25,875 --> 00:03:27,125
What does summer mean?

45
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,250
Tell them, Ruby.

00:03:28,333 --> 00:03:30,916
Uh... It means Love Live

That's my widdle sis!

You're exactly right, you
adorable clever cutie-pie!

49
00:03:35,083 --> 00:03:36,791
You're such a good school
idol, aren't you?

50
00:03:36,875 --> 00:03:37,875
I did my Rubesty!

51
00:03:37,958 --> 00:03:39,750
What's with the
sibling comedy routine?

52
00:03:39,833 --> 00:03:43,166
This is no routine! Uh!
Summer means Love Live.

53
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,541
Everyone knows
this is the season

54
00:03:44,625 --> 00:03:46,541

[DIA grunts]

56

We're starting an intense
training regimen

57
00:03:49,958 --> 00:03:52,250
so the preliminaries will
be a piece of cake.

[DIA] Using my own
top-secret methods,

60
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:57,208
I obtained Mu's training
camp schedule.

61
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:58,750
We'll follow it to the letter.

You're so amazing, Dia!

63
00:04:00,958 --> 00:04:02,375
Swimmin' ten kilometers a day?

64
00:04:02,458 --> 00:04:04,458
And running 15
kilometers? Gross.

65
00:04:04,541 --> 00:04:06,458
There's no way we can
do all of that stuff!

66
00:04:06,541 --> 00:04:08,666
Well. I dunno, I probably could.

67
00:04:08,750 --> 00:04:12,083
All it takes is a little passion
and you can accomplish anything!

68
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:13,958
Do your Rubesty!

69
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:16,333
Why is she so excited
about this torture?

70
00:04:16,416 --> 00:04:18,500
She was totally
holding back before.

71
00:04:18,583 --> 00:04:22,083
But now she's giving it
her all and shining bright!

[DIA]
No bad attitudes!

73
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:27,208
Now, let's head outside
to start our training!

74

[ALL]
Uh...

75
00:04:34,583 --> 00:04:37,125
[YOU] Hey, wait a minute! Didn't
you say you had to help out

76
00:04:37,208 --> 00:04:38,833
at the beach
snack bar, Chika?

77
00:04:38,916 --> 00:04:41,375
That's right! The neighborhood
council is sponsoring it

78
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:42,875
and they asked me
to give them a hand

79
00:04:42,958 --> 00:04:45,166
with all the cooking and
stuff. I almost forgot!

80
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:46,916
Uh! I'm supposed
to help as well.

81
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,916
Not you too! We need to dedicate
our time to training now.

82
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:51,625
That schedule is
not gonna work.

83
00:04:51,708 --> 00:04:53,291
There's no way we'll
be able to do it all.

84
00:04:53,375 --> 00:04:57,666
Between the snack bar and
training, when would we sleep?

85
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:59,166
--[DIA] Heh.
--[RUBY shrieks]

86
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:01,958
Idea! What if we all helped
out at the snack bar

87
00:05:02,041 --> 00:05:04,166
in the afternoon? That would
give us plenty of <i>tempo</i>

88
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:06,166
to schedule training earlier
and later in the day,

89
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:07,208
when it's cooler out.

90
00:05:07,291 --> 00:05:09,000
Sounds like a
perfect plan, zura!

91
00:05:09,083 --> 00:05:10,958
But training was supposed
to last all day!

92
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:12,750
Since we're spending
all our time together,

93
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:14,583
why not hold summer
camp at my place?

94
00:05:14,666 --> 00:05:16,000
[ALL]
Now it's a summer camp?

95
00:05:16,083 --> 00:05:17,833
If we borrow a room
at my family's inn,

96
00:05:17,916 --> 00:05:19,333
everyone can stay over

97
00:05:19,416 --> 00:05:21,041
and we'll have a head start
on the stuff we have to do!

98
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,000
That sounds great!
It'll be especially nice

99
00:05:23,083 --> 00:05:24,666
'cause your house is
right next to the beach!

100
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,666
And we won't have to go
anywhere to meet each other.

101
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,666
We can use the extra time
in the morning and evening

102
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,666
for more practice.

103
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,750
Zura. But is it
okay to stay over

104
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,541
without askin'
permission, Chika?

105
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:36,625
I'll take care of all the
details! Summer camp it is!

All right, I declare
this meeting a success.

Everyone is goofing around.

I got here at four a.m. but...

125
00:06:44,666 --> 00:06:48,541
I guess everybody else must've
still been at home in bed.

126
00:06:49,958 --> 00:06:51,250
Course we were still in bed.

127
00:06:51,333 --> 00:06:53,208
Four a.m.'s way too early.

128
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,458
Fine. So then, we're
going to have to make up

129
00:06:55,541 --> 00:06:57,166
for that lost training time.

130
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:59,708
First things first. We can get
prepared at the snack bar

131
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:02,916

demanding! Let's go.

Huh?! Our snack bar's behind
this dumpy one, right?

There's no use lyin'
to yourself, Dia.

135
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,208
It's a pile of junk.

136
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,208
It is compared to next door.

137
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:20,000
How can we compete
with a place like that?

138
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:23,083
They're from the big city, zura!

to give up the battle

The sort of girls
who win at Love Live

aren't the types to throw
in the towel so easily!

They've gotta step up
to the challenge!

the stops to bring in customers.

outsold us last year.

Well, fancy menus can't
kill our mighty spirit!

We could have saved a lot of

Wow. I think we might

to miss Love Live.

318
00:14:38,666 --> 00:14:40,000
Huh?

319
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,125
[RIKO] You know, I wasn't
sure what to do when I got

320
00:14:42,208 --> 00:14:45,541
the message. Sort of felt like
I was given another chance

321
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:48,875
out of the blue, and I'd
be silly not to take it.

322
00:14:48,958 --> 00:14:51,583
But then, we all started
the summer camp,

323
00:14:51,666 --> 00:14:55,083
and we were hanging
out together.

324
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:57,333
There were a few
things I realized.

325
00:14:57,416 --> 00:15:01,208
I like going to our school,
and being a school idol.

326
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,875
Ever since I moved out here,

327
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:06,083
it's become such a big
part of my life.

328
00:15:06,166 --> 00:15:10,083
I really like every single
member of Aqours.

329
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:13,541
And you, especially.

330
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:20,666
I had to ask myself, "Riko, what
is most important to you?"

331
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,708
[RIKO]
It wasn't a hard decision.

332
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,166
This is exactly where
I want to be.

333
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:30,750
I've never been happier.

334
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:34,750
That's great.

335
00:15:34,833 --> 00:15:36,791
I want to make
the best song I can.

336
00:15:36,875 --> 00:15:39,166
My goal right now is to
help us get through prelims.

337
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:42,250
That's what's important to me.

338
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:45,333
It's the truth.

339
00:15:45,416 --> 00:15:46,875
I understand.

340
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,625
If you're sure that's what
you really wanna do.

341
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,375
[RIKO] If only you'd hurry
up with those lyrics.

342
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:52,833
Hey, stop rushing me!

343
00:15:52,916 --> 00:15:54,916
[RIKO] Relax. You know I'm
only giving you a hard time.

344
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,416
Now c'mon. We should go inside
before we catch cold.

345
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,416
Sure.

346
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:08,750
[BOTH]
Hey!

347
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:11,583
[KANAN, MARI laughing]

348
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,041
[CHIKA, RIKO]
Hey!

349
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:14,708
Here! Enjoy your meal!

350
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:16,208
[RUBY, HANAMARU gasping]

351
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,375
And that's one Stewshine--

352

[HANAMARU, RUBY yelp]

353
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,458
[CHIKA]
Where are you going?

354
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,666
[KANAN] I was going to ask Riko
about the dance. Wanna come?

355
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:27,250
[CHIKA]
Sure do!

356
00:16:27,333 --> 00:16:29,375
Something precious to you?

357
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:32,041
That's going to be the
theme of our lyrics?

358
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,541
I actually just came up with it.

359
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,666
Haven't written
much yet, but here.

360
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:42,291
[RIKO]
Something precious to you.

361
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:45,250
[KANAN]
Riko?

362
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:46,666
[RIKO]
Uh?

363
00:16:46,750 --> 00:16:49,583
[KANAN] Maybe we can take
a look and help Chika out.

364
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,666
[RIKO]
Oh! Of course.

365
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,458
[CHIKA]
Her song...

366
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,625
[BOTH]
Awful.

367
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,625
[CHIKA] I guess that means you
didn't sell much today either.

368
00:16:59,708 --> 00:17:02,833
[YOU] Check it out! I turned
the leftovers into curry!

369
00:17:02,916 --> 00:17:04,541
It's Sailor's Curry with a side

370
00:17:04,625 --> 00:17:07,958
of Stewshine and a few
Tears of a Fallen Angel!

371
00:17:08,041 --> 00:17:09,083
[ALL]
Um...

372
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:11,083
I think this might
be our last meal.

373
00:17:11,166 --> 00:17:14,916
Um. Riko why don't
you do the honors?

374
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:22,666
This is delicious.

375
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,750
Wow You, I had no idea that you
were such an amazing chef!

376
00:17:26,833 --> 00:17:29,083
[MARI]
Mm! <i>Delizioso</i> !

377
00:17:29,166 --> 00:17:31,333
Thanks, it's my papa's
secret recipe!

378
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:32,958
It works with almost anything!

379
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,375
[DIA chuckles]
With that in our back pocket,

380
00:17:35,458 --> 00:17:37,458
we'll sell out
tomorrow for sure.

381
00:17:37,541 --> 00:17:39,041
You okay, Dia?

382
00:17:39,125 --> 00:17:40,125
More please. Zura!

Hey! What's got you
feeling so down, huh?

387
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:48,625
Oh, nothing.

388
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:51,041
I'm okay. Everything's good.

389

[laughing]

391
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,333
Listen up! I will now
begin a lecture

392
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,875
on the history of Love Live

393
00:18:02,958 --> 00:18:05,500
and about the legendary school
idols who have participated.

394
00:18:05,583 --> 00:18:07,166
Why so late?

395
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:09,333
You girls parade around
like serious idols,

396
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,625
but in my opinion you know

397
00:18:10,708 --> 00:18:12,625
far too little about this
sacred competition.

398
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:14,041
Here we go.

399
00:18:14,125 --> 00:18:16,708
We will begin our lesson
with the creation of A-RISE.

400
00:18:16,791 --> 00:18:17,625
Mm?

high time we hit the hay!

It's only nine o'clock.
We're not even sleepy yet.

If we don't quiet
down early tonight

are gonna come

pull our souls out
through our butts!

Uh? What is it?

There's a favor I wanna ask you.

423

[RIKO] It's the middle
of the night, Chika.

424
00:19:21,875 --> 00:19:23,000
Where are we going?

425
00:19:23,083 --> 00:19:25,250
[CHIKA] Don't worry,
just a little farther!

426
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,750
[CHIKA]
I was thinking about it

427
00:19:27,833 --> 00:19:30,666
and I realized that I've never
heard the piece you wrote.

428
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:32,541
We came out here
so you can play,

429
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:34,750
and not worry about
anyone listening in!

430
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:37,333
You spent a lot of time
making this dream a reality.

431
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:38,583
You wrote it.

432
00:19:38,666 --> 00:19:40,125
Even when it seemed impossible

433
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,000
you still gave it
everything you had.

434
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:43,916
Will you please play it for me?

435
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,958
I don't know.

436
00:19:45,041 --> 00:19:46,416
[CHIKA]
Just a little?

437
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,750
You don't have to play
the whole thing.

438
00:19:49,833 --> 00:19:53,041
There's nothing special
about it, really.

[CHIKA]
It's really amazing!

444
00:20:25,583 --> 00:20:29,708
I can tell you put a lot
of yourself into it.

Listen...

[RIKO]
Uh?

447
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,416
You should enter
the competition.

[RIKO gasps]

449
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:42,125
[CHIKA] I know it sounds
crazy of me to say that.

450
00:20:42,208 --> 00:20:43,958
It doesn't even make sense!

451
00:20:44,041 --> 00:20:45,708
I mean, I'm the one
who invited you

452
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,750
to become a school idol
in the first place.

453
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:51,541
Riko, I was so glad you joined,

454
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:54,500
and I know what Aqours
means to you!

455
00:20:54,583 --> 00:20:56,541
But... But you have to!

456
00:20:56,625 --> 00:20:58,583
You don't want me in the
group anymore, do you?

457
00:20:58,666 --> 00:21:01,791
[CHIKA] That's not it!
Of course I want you there!

458
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:03,833
I started thinking about

459
00:21:03,916 --> 00:21:09,250
when I first asked you
to join me and You.

460
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:10,666
You were nervous.

461
00:21:10,750 --> 00:21:12,500
And you worried that
you'd lost your passion

462
00:21:12,583 --> 00:21:14,375
for playing the piano.

463
00:21:14,458 --> 00:21:16,666
I thought if we worked on
being school idols together

464
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,208
you might get inspired.

465
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,916
I hoped that you'd feel better
about everything again.

466
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:25,041
I hoped that you'd get back to
it, and face all of your fears.

467
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:27,041
I thought that might be nice.

468
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,083
But I...

469
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:30,125
Uh?

470
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,875
There's so much to think about.

471
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,666
You care about our town,
our school, and our friends.

472
00:21:36,750 --> 00:21:38,916
I feel the same way.

473
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,166
Tell me though.

474
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:42,041
Doesn't playing the piano
mean just as much?

475
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:45,250
It used to be the most important
thing in the whole world.

Only you can answer that.

477
00:21:47,708 --> 00:21:50,208
I'll wait for you
to figure it out.

478
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:53,958
We're not going anywhere.

479
00:21:54,041 --> 00:21:56,000
Don't be afraid to compete.

480
00:21:56,083 --> 00:21:59,250
We'll all be waiting right here
for you no matter what happens.

481
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:01,375
I promise!
