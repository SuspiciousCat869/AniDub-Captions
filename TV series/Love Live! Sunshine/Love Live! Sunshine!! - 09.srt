Huh?

00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,666
[KANAN]
I'm sorry.

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:19,291
But I quit.

4
00:00:19,375 --> 00:00:21,083
I'm done being an idol.

5
00:00:21,166 --> 00:00:23,458
[MARI]
Why?

6
00:00:23,541 --> 00:00:25,583
Because of Tokyo?

7
00:00:25,666 --> 00:00:28,791
Listen, it's no <i>problema</i> !

8
00:00:28,875 --> 00:00:32,208
[KANAN] Mari, don't you have
the chance to study abroad?

9
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,000
You should really go.

10
00:00:34,083 --> 00:00:37,958
No way. Are you
serious right now?

11
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,500
We've already talked about this,

12
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:42,125
and I decided to stay
here at Uranohoshi.

13
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,166
Come on, Dia, back me up!

14
00:00:49,458 --> 00:00:52,291
Say something.

15
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:54,250
[KANAN]
She agrees with me.

16
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:57,291
There's no point in continuing.

17
00:00:59,083 --> 00:01:02,416
[MARI]
Kanan! Dia!

18
00:01:08,833 --> 00:01:10,958
It's time to move on.

19
00:02:42,541 --> 00:02:44,250
Oh, boy. The festival!

20
00:02:44,333 --> 00:02:47,333
[HANAMARU] I wanna visit
the yummy food stalls, zura!

21
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:49,333
Oh, what an amazing
bench this is!

22
00:02:49,416 --> 00:02:52,208
In the name of Yohane I
claim thee as my perch!

23
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:53,750
What do we do with here?

24
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:56,875
We got back from Tokyo and she's
stuck in fallen angel mode.

25
00:02:56,958 --> 00:02:58,458
[HANAMARU]
Just leave her alone.

26
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,666
Where's Shiitake?

27
00:02:59,750 --> 00:03:02,333
Hopefully that crazy dog
is put up somewhere.

28
00:03:02,416 --> 00:03:05,958
Hey Chika, what are we going
to do for the summer festival?

29
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:07,916
Excellent question
as always, You.

30
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,291
Let me think on it a bit.

31
00:03:09,375 --> 00:03:11,625
Well, Numazu's fireworks
show's pretty cool.

32
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:13,750
I can't believe they want
us to perform there.

33
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:16,500
It could be a good opportunity.

34
00:03:16,583 --> 00:03:19,583
Not to mention it's also a great
way to get our name out there.

35
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,125
That's true.

36
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:23,833
But it's so soon it doesn't
leave us much time to practice.

37
00:03:23,916 --> 00:03:26,208
We should be fine.
We'll just have to focus

38
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:29,000
and make whatever practices
we do have count.

39

shine as bright as we can!

And if that's still not enough,
then we'll work even harder!

Rinse and repeat and
we're sure to succeed!

Keep up the good work!

Hold on, tell me something!

59
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:16,833
Were you a school idol?

[KANAN]
Talk about nosy.

61
00:04:19,916 --> 00:04:22,083
I used to be.

62
00:04:25,208 --> 00:04:26,333
[YOU]
What's wrong?

63
00:04:26,416 --> 00:04:27,833
It's Kanan.

64
00:04:27,916 --> 00:04:29,833
I just don't understand why she
quit being a school idol.

65
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:32,250
I thought the president
already explained it.

66
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:33,708
She froze up and couldn't sing

67
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:35,750
when they were in
Tokyo or something.

68
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,000
[CHIKA]
That's what she said,

69
00:04:37,083 --> 00:04:39,375
but it's not like Kanan
to give up so easily.

70

[RIKO]
Oh, really?

71
00:04:40,750 --> 00:04:42,958
Yeah. I've known her
since we were kids

72
00:04:43,041 --> 00:04:45,875
and she was always
super strong.

73
00:04:45,958 --> 00:04:48,416
[KANAN] Come on,
don't be chicken, Chika!

You gotta be brave
or you'll regret it.

So that's how she is.

80
00:05:07,166 --> 00:05:10,208
But looking at her now, she
seems so distant and stuff.

I've got it!

00:05:13,625 --> 00:05:16,833
She's been possessed
by a powerful demon!

84

Talk about a head scratcher.

85

It'd be so much easier

86
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,416
if I knew more about when
she was a school idol.

87

Maybe, but we'll never know
since she won't talk about it.

Have you ever overhead
them talking?

Right.

Whoa, no kidding?

104
00:05:59,125 --> 00:06:01,000
I don't know all the details,

105
00:06:01,083 --> 00:06:02,916
but I'm pretty sure
the Tokyo performance

106
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,666
is what started this whole mess.

107
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:06,666
Because when Dia got
back from their trip,

108

she suddenly didn't wanna
talk about school idols.

But just because I'm back

to hold you back.

The Kanan I knew would never
run from her feelings,

she'd keep going and
fight for her dreams.

big smile on her face.

It's been two whole

that we can't be idols anymore!

But you can't force Kanan to
change her mind and go back to

being a school idol, no matter
how much you wish she would!

Why not?!

Why are you both so eager to
give up your school idol dreams?

Chika-chi and Aqours didn't!

failed, so why are you?!

about what happened there.

But you've never
been one to give up

And besides, I can't since
I'm a school idol now!

320
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:21,291
We want to save this place!

321
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:28,000
[MARI]
You're kidding?

322
00:15:28,083 --> 00:15:30,583
So that's why.

323
00:15:32,208 --> 00:15:33,875
[DIA]
Where are you going?

324
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:35,458
I'm gonna slug her!

325
00:15:35,541 --> 00:15:39,625
Because she just... 'cause she
should have told me the truth!

326
00:15:39,708 --> 00:15:41,666
You're so selfish.

327
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:46,375
All Kanan has ever done is worry
about you and your well-being.

328
00:15:49,458 --> 00:15:53,041
[DIA]
About how you fit in.

329
00:15:53,125 --> 00:15:55,166
About your feelings.

330
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,833
[DIA]
And...

331
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:02,291
...about your future.

332
00:16:07,416 --> 00:16:10,458
[DIA]
She cares more than anyone.

333
00:16:13,791 --> 00:16:15,583
[MARI]
How would I know that?!

334
00:16:15,666 --> 00:16:18,041
She never bothered to tell me!

335
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,333
[DIA]
She showed you all the time.

336
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,875
You just never
bothered to see it.

337
00:16:31,416 --> 00:16:33,750
[MARI grunting]

338
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,500
She did.

339
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:41,916
[MARI]
Huh?

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,250
[KANAN] Were you listening
to anything I said?

341
00:16:44,333 --> 00:16:50,583
Even if you had to move again,
I'd never forget about you.

342
00:16:54,541 --> 00:16:56,375
Kanan...

343
00:17:24,041 --> 00:17:25,916
Stupid.

344
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,708
[KANAN]
Mari?

345
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:31,333
[MARI] It's time we settled
this once and for all.

346
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:33,375
[splash]

347
00:17:33,458 --> 00:17:35,666
[MARI]
Why didn't tell me back then?

348
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:38,791
You should have told me
what you were feeling!

349
00:17:38,875 --> 00:17:41,083
I wanted to look out for
you like you did for me,

350
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:44,375
because that's what friends
are supposed to do!

351
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:49,166
[MARI] I didn't care about
my future back then.

352
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,541
Studying abroad?

353
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:53,000
Why would I care about
such a silly thing?

354
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:54,666
You couldn't sing.

355
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:57,833
You couldn't sing, Kanan,
and I couldn't let that go!

356
00:17:57,916 --> 00:17:59,750
I thought you needed me!

357
00:17:59,833 --> 00:18:03,166
[gasps]

358
00:18:07,291 --> 00:18:08,541
Listen.

359
00:18:08,625 --> 00:18:10,958
I care about you
more than anything!

360
00:18:11,041 --> 00:18:13,875
Don't forget that.

361
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,333
If that's true...

362
00:18:15,416 --> 00:18:17,750
If that's honestly how
you feel deep inside,

363
00:18:17,833 --> 00:18:18,916
then say it!

364
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,541
Stop making it all
about winning Love Live!

365
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:23,125
Be real with me!

366
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:24,125
[MARI]
You're right.

367
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:25,208
[KANAN]
Uh?

368
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,500
So, go ahead.

369
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,291
[MARI whimpers]

370
00:18:38,375 --> 00:18:40,791
[DIA] We'll be in so much
trouble if we get caught!

371
00:18:40,875 --> 00:18:42,000
[KANAN]
Don't worry!

372
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,041
Huh?

373
00:18:44,125 --> 00:18:44,583
[DIA shrieks]

374
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:46,375
[laughs]

375
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,166
[MARI]
Who are you?

376
00:18:48,250 --> 00:18:49,833
Um, hug!

377
00:18:49,916 --> 00:18:51,291
Uh?

378
00:18:54,375 --> 00:18:56,125
Hug me!

379
00:18:57,958 --> 00:19:00,041
Hug me.

380
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,041
[cries]

381
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:14,583
[BOTH crying]

382
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,708
[CHIKA laughs]
You care for them a lot.

383
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,333
I think I might be starting
to figure you out!

384
00:19:30,416 --> 00:19:31,875
That may be,

385
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:33,541
but you're going to have to
take care of them from now on.

386
00:19:33,625 --> 00:19:36,333
Oh and fair warning, they're
a pretty sensitive pair.

387
00:19:36,416 --> 00:19:38,791
Maybe I should keep you
around since you're the expert.

388
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,916
Wait, what?

389
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,000
I don't have time
to be in any clubs.


390
00:19:42,083 --> 00:19:44,333
I'm far too busy with
the student council.


391
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,208
Oh, stop making up excuses!


392
00:19:46,291 --> 00:19:48,208
Now that we have Mari and Kanan,


393
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:51,000
we only need one more person
to make Aqours perfect.


394
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,958
[DIA]
Ruby?


395
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:55,708
We made this especially
for you, Sis!

396
00:19:55,791 --> 00:19:58,833
Consider it your
welcome present!

397
00:20:07,500 --> 00:20:12,458
[music plays]

398
00:20:20,750 --> 00:20:25,708
[singing in Japanese]

399
00:23:14,583 --> 00:23:16,750
[KANAN laughs]
So Aqours, huh?


400
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:19,083
[YOU]
Hm? Yeah, what's so funny?


401
00:23:19,166 --> 00:23:20,916
When we had our
school idol group,


402
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,833
it happened to also
be called Aqours.


403
00:23:22,916 --> 00:23:24,958
Whoa! That's super crazy.


404
00:23:25,041 --> 00:23:27,541
[RIKO]
Yes, what a coincidence.


405
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:30,125
[KANAN] Well, I suppose it
could be a coincidence.


406
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:30,750
[YOU]
Wait...


407
00:23:30,833 --> 00:23:32,916
[ALL]
Mm?


408
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:36,083
[KANAN] But I think... It's more
likely that a certain someone


409
00:23:36,166 --> 00:23:38,458
was playing us like fiddles.


410
00:23:38,541 --> 00:23:40,791
[RIKO] Oh my gosh,
I said to forget about it!


411
00:23:40,875 --> 00:23:42,666
[CHIKA]
Okay!


412
00:23:42,750 --> 00:23:44,208
[KANAN]
But I won't name names.


413
00:23:44,291 --> 00:23:45,625
[YOU]
Aqours?


414
00:23:46,958 --> 00:23:49,833
[ALL] Next time,
"We've got Stewshine!"
