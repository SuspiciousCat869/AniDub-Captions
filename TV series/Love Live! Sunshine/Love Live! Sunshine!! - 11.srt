Uh?

[CHIKA] Next time, we'll

I can't wait!

in the Hokkaido qualifiers!

Oh. Is that the group

You met them in Tokyo?

Yeah, aren't they so awesome?

[KANAN] I get how you're
feeling right now.

35
00:03:08,833 --> 00:03:11,000
But focus more on
the upcoming prelims

and less on our
possible competition.

How about a little

to get the pool
cleaned again, Dia?

00:03:42,916 --> 00:03:45,125
Perhaps, but you were
supposed to remind me!

00:03:45,208 --> 00:03:46,291
I did though!

54
00:03:46,375 --> 00:03:47,750
Remember back when
summer started?

00:03:47,833 --> 00:03:50,041
I said you needed to do
something about the pool.

Well obviously I'm doing
something about it right now!

to help you out with stuff.

Her absence is going to
throw off our formation.

[KANAN]
I'm not sure.

We could change the routine,

or we could try to find
someone to stand in for her.

00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:59,250
that I got to the studio
in Tokyo safely.

164
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:03,250
Yeah. It's nice but kind of
dull without you ladies.

165
00:08:03,333 --> 00:08:06,208
[CHIKA laughs]
Oh, wait, hang on a sec.

166
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,541
Wanna say hi to everyone?
Here, Hanamaru!

167
00:08:08,625 --> 00:08:14,125
[gasps] Uh, uh...
hello, hello there!

168
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:16,125
[RIKO]
Hanamaru? How are you?

169
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:18,291
Eek! It's the future, zura!

170
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:19,791
You've got to be kidding me.

171
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,750
Surely you at least know
how to use a smart phone.

172
00:08:21,833 --> 00:08:23,000
[RIKO]
Oh, is that Yoshiko?

173
00:08:23,083 --> 00:08:24,958
[gasps]

174
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:29,000
[laughs] I, Yohane, am
busy falling from grace.

175
00:08:29,083 --> 00:08:31,333
Uh... Here, talk to Ruby!

176
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,500
[RIKO]
Hi there!

177
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:35,541
[RUBY shrieks]

178
00:08:35,625 --> 00:08:39,125
[CHIKA] Why's everybody so shy?
It's not like she's a stranger!

179
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:41,125
[HANAMARU] I get nervous
talkin' on the phone,

180
00:08:41,208 --> 00:08:42,708
plus it's comin' from Tokyo!

181
00:08:42,791 --> 00:08:44,250
[CHIKA]
Does it matter?

182
00:08:44,333 --> 00:08:45,958
Anyway, it's You's turn!

183
00:08:46,041 --> 00:08:47,125
Huh?

184
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:48,833
Is there anything you
wanna say to Riko?

185
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,875
Go on!

186
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:52,583
Yeah.

187
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:56,291
[gasps] I'm sorry, my
phone's battery is low.

188
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,708
Of course I didn't
forget to charge it!

189
00:08:58,791 --> 00:08:59,833
Or did I...?

190
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,208
[laughs] Don't worry about it.

191
00:09:02,291 --> 00:09:04,083
Tell everyone I said hi, okay?

192
00:09:04,166 --> 00:09:05,625
[CHIKA]
Yep!

193
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:13,500
Oh, good. She sounds great.
All settled in.

194
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,333
[CHIKA]
All right, You!

195
00:09:22,416 --> 00:09:24,666
Do you feel like running
through it a few more times?

196
00:09:24,750 --> 00:09:26,291
Just to be sure.

197
00:09:26,375 --> 00:09:29,250
Yeah. You betcha!

198
00:09:31,541 --> 00:09:32,958
I know you're a workaholic,

199
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:35,458
but you can't handle all this
paperwork by yourself.

200
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,916
It's not that much.
I can handle it.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,708
Whatever! This is why Kanan
and I came by to help!

202
00:09:40,791 --> 00:09:42,833
You'd be like, super
lost without us here!

203
00:09:42,916 --> 00:09:44,791
[paper rustling]

204
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:46,250
[MARI]
What's that form?

205
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,916
Chika's original application
to form the idol club.

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,875
I'd almost forgotten
that she turned it in.

207
00:09:53,333 --> 00:09:54,833
No way!

208
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,500
I didn't expect Chika-chi and
You to be the founding members.

209
00:09:57,583 --> 00:09:58,958
Why's that?

210
00:09:59,041 --> 00:10:00,666
Well, looking at them now,
I thought it would have been

211
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:02,833
Chika and Riko who
started the club.

212
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,666
Yes, I could
certainly understand

213
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,125
how you got that impression,

214
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:09,583
especially with how close
the two of them are now.

215
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,666
But it was You.

216
00:10:20,916 --> 00:10:25,166
[YOU] Should I really
be Riko's stand in?

217
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:26,500
[MARI]
Ha! Whoa!

218
00:10:26,583 --> 00:10:29,166
These puppies could give
Kanan a run for her money!

219
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,833
[MARI screams]

220
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,958
[MARI]
Oh! Ouchie!

221
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:36,208
Huh?! Ah!

222
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:37,916
Uh. Mari?

223
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,083
[MARI laughs]

224
00:10:40,166 --> 00:10:43,083
[ALL]
Love Live! Sunshine!!

225
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:47,375
[YOU]
You wanna talk about Chika?

226
00:10:47,458 --> 00:10:48,583
[MARI]
<i>Si</i> !

227
00:10:48,666 --> 00:10:50,250
Are you ladies
having a <i>problema</i> ?

228
00:10:50,333 --> 00:10:53,333
[YOU] Oh, uh...
not so much anymore.

229
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,875
We practiced a bunch so I
think we've got it down now.

230
00:10:56,958 --> 00:10:58,041
[MARI]
Good.

231
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,625
But I wasn't talking
about the dance.

232
00:10:59,708 --> 00:11:01,041
Huh?

233
00:11:01,125 --> 00:11:05,708
Riko stole Chika-chi from
you and now a fire rages!

234
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:08,333
Like a huge burning
storm of jealousy!

235
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:10,416
Huh? It does not!

236
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:13,083
I think you broke
your storm radar.

237
00:11:13,166 --> 00:11:14,500
[groans]

238
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:19,083
Liar liar! Come on, you
can be real with me.

239
00:11:19,166 --> 00:11:20,500
Uh. What do you mean?

240
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,833
Let it out. You can't talk
to Riko or Chika-chi,

241
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:28,000
so talk to me instead. Sit down.

242
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,291
Here's the thing...

243
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:40,625
For a while now,

244
00:11:40,708 --> 00:11:43,208
I've really wanted to do
something fun with Chika.

245
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:45,375
You know, make some
cool memories.

246
00:11:45,458 --> 00:11:50,250
But before I knew it, we were
already in middle school.

247
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:54,083
You're planning on joining
the Swimming Club, aren't you?

248
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:55,500
[YOU]
Yep! What about you?

249
00:11:55,583 --> 00:11:57,750
Oh, I don't know.

250
00:11:58,291 --> 00:12:00,083
[YOU]
This year, when Chika told me

251
00:12:00,166 --> 00:12:01,833
she wanted to start
the school idol club,

252
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:05,708
and she asked me to join too,
I was super happy.

253
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:10,083
I was excited to finally
do something together.

254
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:13,833
And then... Well,
Riko joined the club

255
00:12:13,916 --> 00:12:18,375
and the two of them began
writing songs together.

256
00:12:18,458 --> 00:12:24,750
Soon after, everyone else had
joined and I began to wonder.

257
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:28,416
Maybe Chika didn't want it
to be just the two of us,

258
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:32,083
and my being there was bad.

259
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,375
You? Why's that?

260
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:36,833
[YOU]
Just because.

261
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:38,791
I don't mind everyone
else joining,

262
00:12:38,875 --> 00:12:42,125
but I've always been told that
I pick things up really easily.

263
00:12:42,208 --> 00:12:44,958
So I thought, and it
might sound stupid,

264
00:12:45,041 --> 00:12:48,791
but maybe I'm making
things hard for her.

265
00:12:48,875 --> 00:12:49,333
[MARI]
Hiyah!

266
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:50,833
[YOU]
Ow!

267
00:12:50,916 --> 00:12:52,291
Well that's a lot of assuming,

268
00:12:52,375 --> 00:12:53,875
and what happens when
you assume things?

269
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:55,208
Yeah, but...

270
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:57,791
[MARI] Shake it off,
shake it off, shake it off!

271
00:12:57,875 --> 00:12:59,916
Stop keeping it all inside.

272
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,333
You love, Chika-chi, right?

273
00:13:01,416 --> 00:13:03,041
[YOU]
Duh.

274
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:07,208
Then you just need to be like,
totally honest with her!

275
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,708
Huh?

276
00:13:08,791 --> 00:13:11,166
[MARI] I'm speaking from
experience on this one.

277
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:12,875
I wasn't honest
with my best friends

278
00:13:12,958 --> 00:13:14,791
and we lost two whole years.

279
00:13:14,875 --> 00:13:17,125
Learn from my mistakes.

[gasps]

281
00:13:24,291 --> 00:13:27,875
I can tell her the truth, right?

282
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,625
Good morning!

283
00:13:30,708 --> 00:13:32,958
[CHIKA]
Oh! Morning, You!

284
00:13:33,041 --> 00:13:36,416
Heh. Hey, check this out! Look!

Wow, cute! It looks good on you!

286
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:42,208
Yeah, I know, right? And
there's one for everybody!

287
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:43,708

Wasn't that nice?

290
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,625
Riko's gonna wear one
when she performs too!

291
00:13:48,708 --> 00:13:51,791
Here's one for you. Ta dah!

to start practice?

Hm?

00:14:04,791 --> 00:14:06,291
Let's work hard today.

300
00:14:06,375 --> 00:14:07,833
Yeah!

301
00:14:10,625 --> 00:14:14,208
I never did actually
talk to her.

302
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:15,916
What should I do?

303
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,666
I don't even know
where I would start.

304
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:19,291
[CHIKA]
Huh?

305
00:14:19,375 --> 00:14:20,750
Listen up.

306
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,333
Which one of us do you
love more, me or Riko?

Tell me, now!

308
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:28,416
[laughs] Maybe too
straightforward.

Oh, Chika...

Please tell me how
you really feel.

I know!

Look Chika, I'm full steam
ahead for you, okay?

on in my head today?

00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:08,541
No, not busy at all.

322
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:09,916
Did you need something?

323
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:13,250
[RIKO] Yeah. It's just that,
well, I heard you had to

324
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,000
stand in for me during
the prelim performance.

325
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:19,125
I'm sorry. I feel kinda selfish.

326
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:20,708
[YOU]
Nah, you're fine.

327
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,625
I wanted to say don't
worry about me.

328
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:25,250
You should do whatever works
for the two of you.

329
00:15:25,333 --> 00:15:29,833
[YOU]
But... I...

330
00:15:29,916 --> 00:15:31,916
Don't force yourself
to copy me.

331
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,708
You have your own unique way of
moving, and it's perfect.

332
00:15:34,791 --> 00:15:35,958
[YOU]
I dunno.

333
00:15:36,041 --> 00:15:38,583
Well I'm sure that
Chika feels the same.

334
00:15:38,666 --> 00:15:41,208
[YOU] I don't think
she does... not really.

335
00:15:41,291 --> 00:15:42,750
Huh?

336
00:15:42,833 --> 00:15:44,291
[YOU]
No matter how you look at it,

337
00:15:44,375 --> 00:15:47,916
you're the best person to stand
beside Chika for this song.

338
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,291
Besides...

339
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:51,541
...I've noticed she
always looks happiest

340
00:15:51,625 --> 00:15:54,208
when she's with you,
and she's constantly

341
00:15:54,291 --> 00:15:57,708
talking about doing her
best because of you.

342
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:03,250
I get it, so that's
how you see things.

343
00:16:09,833 --> 00:16:10,958
[RIKO]
Listen.

344
00:16:11,041 --> 00:16:12,958
There's something
you should know.

345
00:16:13,041 --> 00:16:14,583
Huh?

346
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:21,125
[RIKO]
Okay, bye.

347
00:16:23,833 --> 00:16:26,125
Is that true?

348
00:16:27,166 --> 00:16:27,958
[CHIKA]
Hey, You!

349
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:29,416
[gasps]

350
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,916
[CHIKA]
Hey, You!

351
00:16:36,083 --> 00:16:39,000
Huh?!

352
00:16:39,083 --> 00:16:41,916
Chika? What are you doing?

353
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,916
[CHIKA] I thought maybe
we could practice!

354
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:44,833
Right now?

355
00:16:44,916 --> 00:16:46,541
[CHIKA]
Yeah, right now!

356
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:49,416
I've been thinking hard
about it, and I decided,

357
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:53,333
well, I think we should use your
own moves in the routine!

358
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,791
You don't have to change
your stride or anything.

359
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:57,916
I figure we can start over
from the beginning.

360
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,375
We'll do it together,
just the two of us!

361
00:17:00,458 --> 00:17:01,916
[YOU gasps]

362
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,875
Hey, wait!

363
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:13,208
[RIKO]
Listen.

364
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,083
There's something
you should know

365
00:17:15,166 --> 00:17:16,541
about Chika.

366
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:18,041
She told me before

367
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,541
she was worried about
always having to turn down

368
00:17:20,625 --> 00:17:23,541
your invitations to
do things together.

369
00:17:26,041 --> 00:17:27,500
[RIKO]
And that's why

370
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:31,208
she was really determined to
become a school idol with you.

371
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:34,708
She wanted to see it
through with you!

372
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:38,458
[footsteps, door creaks]

373
00:17:38,541 --> 00:17:40,500
Ha! Huh...?

374
00:17:44,041 --> 00:17:45,958
What's wrong?

375
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:52,333
You're covered with sweat.
What happened to you?

376
00:17:52,416 --> 00:17:54,250
Oh, there aren't
any buses running

377
00:17:54,333 --> 00:17:59,500
and my sister was too busy
to give me a ride over here.

378
00:17:59,583 --> 00:18:01,083
I don't really know
what's going on,

379
00:18:01,166 --> 00:18:03,166
but you haven't seemed
like yourself lately.

380
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:06,000
I'm probably overthinking it,
but I wanted to be sure.

381
00:18:06,083 --> 00:18:08,500
Ha, ha. Uh...

382
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:11,333
Oh, wow.

383
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:13,791
I'm so...

384
00:18:13,875 --> 00:18:16,083
I'm so dumb!

385
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,708
Why are you dumb?

386
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:21,208
[CHIKA screams]
We're gonna get dirty!

387
00:18:21,291 --> 00:18:22,250
I don't care!

388
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:23,625
[CHIKA]
The ground is cold!

389
00:18:23,708 --> 00:18:24,541
[YOU]
I don't care!

390
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,041
[CHIKA]
This is embarrassing!

391
00:18:26,125 --> 00:18:27,583
[YOU]
I don't care!

392
00:18:27,666 --> 00:18:29,125
[CHIKA] We can't sit in the
middle of the street like this!

393
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,458
[YOU]
I don't care!

394
00:18:30,541 --> 00:18:33,208
[CHIKA]
You're ridiculous!

395
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,833
[BOTH laugh]

396
00:18:50,541 --> 00:18:52,458
Let's do this.

397
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:55,625
Let's do this!

398
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,750
This one is for Love Live!

399
00:18:57,833 --> 00:19:00,625
This one is for our
first big step!

400
00:19:00,708 --> 00:19:04,416
Let's go out there and shine
brighter than ever before!

401
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,958
Aqours!

402
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:10,791
[ALL]
Sunshine!

403
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:20,916
[RIKO]
I get it. I understand.

404
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,166
I didn't at first,
but I finally know

405
00:19:23,250 --> 00:19:26,625
why Chika wanted to be
a school idol so badly.

406
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,458
It wasn't about her.

407
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,791
It was about so much more.

408
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,958
[YOU]
Yeah.

409
00:19:32,041 --> 00:19:34,416
Because for Chika,
shining isn't something

410
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:38,250
she wanted to do by herself. She
wanted to share that spotlight

411
00:19:38,333 --> 00:19:42,333
and join hands with others so
we could all shine together.

412
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:43,666
[RIKO]
You and me,

413
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:46,916
and the rest of Aqours,
we shined much brighter--

414
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:50,958
more than we could have ever
possibly shone by ourselves.

415
00:19:51,041 --> 00:19:54,500
That feeling spread to our
school, to our community,

416
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:58,250
to those who watched us
perform, and it connects us.

417
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,583
[YOU]
I agree.

418
00:19:59,666 --> 00:20:01,666
That's what Chika wanted to do.

419
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:06,500
To discover that shining
feeling and be a school idol.

420
00:20:06,583 --> 00:20:08,083
[inhales]

421
00:20:08,166 --> 00:20:13,125
[singing in Japanese]

422
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:50,791
[CHIKA]
Next time, "It's time to fly."
