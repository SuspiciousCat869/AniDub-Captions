00:09:48,708 --> 00:09:50,083
[gasps]

163
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,458
Isn't it frustrating?

164
00:09:52,541 --> 00:09:54,791
Yeah, it is, I mean,
a little bit.

165
00:09:54,875 --> 00:09:56,333
But we really did our best,

166
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:59,708
so I'd say I'm pretty
darn satisfied.

167
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:02,666
It was fun. Just... fun.

168
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,958
All right.

169
00:10:10,375 --> 00:10:12,333
[RUBY sighs]
We're finally home!

170
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:14,666
[HANAMARU] That means I
can say zura again, zura!

171
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:16,000
[YOSHIKO]
It's not like you ever stopped.

172
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:17,458
[HANAMARU]
Zura!

173
00:10:17,541 --> 00:10:18,791
[STUDENTS]
Hey!

174
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,500
[CHIKA]
Wow, look, everyone's here!

175
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:23,041
[STUDENTS]
Welcome home!

176
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,958
How did you like Tokyo,
was it fun?

177
00:10:25,041 --> 00:10:26,583
Well, yeah!

178
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,708
There were all kinds
of cool places to shop

179
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,375
and a ton of delicious
foods to try!

180
00:10:30,458 --> 00:10:31,458
Did you sing well?

181
00:10:31,541 --> 00:10:33,625
Tell us! You didn't get
nervous, did ya?

182
00:10:33,708 --> 00:10:35,708
A bit! We survived
it all though.

183
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,958
Right?

184
00:10:37,041 --> 00:10:39,250
Yeah, we sure did. And
the routine went well.

185
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:40,750
You know, it's funny
you  brought it up

186
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,416
'cause we were just
talking about how

187
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:43,583
it was the best performance

188
00:10:43,666 --> 00:10:45,583
we've ever done and
it all went awesome.

189
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,166
That's great to hear!

190
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:49,666
Guess I got all worried
for nothing. Yay!

191
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,666
I knew it! So that
means the rumors

192
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,875
about you aiming to win
Love Live are true!

193
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,208
Huh?

194
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:56,416
Of course they're all true!

195
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:57,583
I mean, you don't get invited

196
00:10:57,666 --> 00:10:59,375
to a big event in
Tokyo for nothing!

197
00:10:59,458 --> 00:11:02,708
Yeah, you got it! Well,
we'll do what we can!

198
00:11:02,791 --> 00:11:04,500
[BOTH exhale]

199
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:05,250
[DIA]
Welcome back.

200
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:06,666
[RUBY gasps]

201
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,458
[RUBY]
Dia.

202
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:16,416
[RUBY whimpers]

203
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:18,583
[cries]

204
00:11:18,666 --> 00:11:21,791
You did the best
you could, Ruby.

205
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:30,333
[RUBY cries]

206
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:42,250
[MARI]
It's been quite a while

207
00:11:42,333 --> 00:11:44,375
since you called me
out here like this.

208
00:11:44,458 --> 00:11:47,625
[KANAN] Well, Dia reached out.
She told me about the girls.

209
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:48,875
[MARI]
Oh?

210
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,125
[KANAN]
What are you going to do?

211
00:11:54,208 --> 00:11:56,791
[GIRLS]
Love Live! Sunshine!!

212
00:11:58,875 --> 00:12:01,916
[DIA] So no one in the
audience voted for you?

213
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,416
That's right.

214
00:12:03,500 --> 00:12:06,666
Considering how intense school
idol competitions can be,

215
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:10,250
I wish I could say I was
surprised to hear that.

216
00:12:10,333 --> 00:12:12,166
I want you to understand this...

217
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:15,541
Despite the outcome not being
ideal, this wasn't a failure.

218
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,416
You have so much dedication!

219
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,000
You practice for hours on end,

220
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:22,708
and you gave the audience one of
your best performances to date.

221
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:25,583
However, that alone
won't be enough.

222
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:28,416
Every year, expectations grow.

223
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:30,250
[YOU]
What do you mean by that?

224
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:33,125
[DIA]
7,236.

225
00:12:33,208 --> 00:12:35,375
Does that number mean
anything to you?

226
00:12:35,458 --> 00:12:37,000
--Yohane counts her--
--No, zura.

227
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:40,541
You didn't let me finish!

228
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:42,208
That was the final
number of entrants

229
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,791
for Love Live last year.

230
00:12:43,875 --> 00:12:46,166
And, it will only
continue to rise.

231
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:49,125
It's ten times the amount
of the first competition.

232
00:12:49,208 --> 00:12:51,333
So many...

233
00:12:51,416 --> 00:12:53,458
School idols have
always been popular,

234
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,750
and that won't change
any time soon.

235
00:12:55,833 --> 00:12:58,708
The truth is that ever
since Love Live began,

236
00:12:58,791 --> 00:13:01,791
more and more girls are deciding
to become school idols.

237
00:13:01,875 --> 00:13:04,333
Groups like A-RISE and
Mu's are so famous

238
00:13:04,416 --> 00:13:06,125
the trend is sure to continue.

239
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:09,708
And now they're even holding
the championships in Akiba Dome.

240
00:13:09,791 --> 00:13:13,791
You see, That's the reality
of being a school idol.

241
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:14,416
[RIKO]
Wow.

242
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,958
[DIA]
Yes.

243
00:13:16,041 --> 00:13:18,208
You didn't get any audience
votes, and we couldn't perform.

244
00:13:18,291 --> 00:13:20,625
Nothing more can be done
about those things now.

245
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:22,000
That's just how it is.

246
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:24,375
[gasps] Wait, you
didn't perform?

247
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:26,583
What do you mean?

248
00:13:27,875 --> 00:13:31,291
Two years ago there was a
similar rumor circulating

249
00:13:31,375 --> 00:13:33,916
about our school
being shut down.

250
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,041
School idol? Who, me?

251
00:13:37,125 --> 00:13:38,500
Of course you!

252
00:13:38,583 --> 00:13:40,458
We're forming a group and if
it becomes popular enough

253
00:13:40,541 --> 00:13:42,166
we might be able
to save the school!

254
00:13:42,250 --> 00:13:43,833
You're so stylish!

255
00:13:43,916 --> 00:13:46,916
Mari, if you join our team would
hit the top ranks in no time!

256
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,250
[MARI]
<i>Scusa</i> .

257
00:13:48,333 --> 00:13:51,708
I'm not interested in
that type of thing.

258
00:13:51,791 --> 00:13:53,041
Hug! [laughs]

259
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:54,125
Hey, what are you doing?!

260
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:55,833
I won't let go! Say yes!

261
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:57,625
This is peer pressure, yunno?!

262
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:58,666
[KANAN]
No way!

263
00:13:58,750 --> 00:14:00,291
[MARI]
Come on already! Quit it!

264
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,833
[KANAN] Say you'll join us
or I'll hold out forever!

265
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:08,583
[MARI] I don't know where
things went wrong.

266
00:14:08,666 --> 00:14:10,791
Everyone in the town supported
what we were doing,

267
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:13,666
and we all seemed to be
having a wonderful time!

268
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:18,333
Yes, and the one show we
did went well too. But...

269
00:14:18,416 --> 00:14:19,833
Perform in Tokyo?

270
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:21,250
Yes, perform in Tokyo!

271
00:14:21,333 --> 00:14:23,333
We've been invited to
participate in the competition!

272
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:25,291
Keep yelling like that and
you'll blow your voice out

273
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:26,916
before we even get there.

274
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,750
[DIA] This is our one chance
to change everything!

275
00:14:28,833 --> 00:14:30,625
If we can make everyone
fall in love with us there,

276
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:33,625
we'll qualify for
Love Live easy!

277
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:38,291
But then, we couldn't
even sing a note.

278
00:14:38,375 --> 00:14:41,416
We were blown away by the
talent of the other groups.

279
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,291
The stage seemed so big
and the lights so bright.

280
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:48,250
We were terrified to perform.

281
00:14:49,916 --> 00:14:51,750
Count yourselves lucky
that you managed to get

282
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,083
as far as you did.

283
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,750
I see now. That's why you
were against us, huh?

284
00:14:55,833 --> 00:14:58,750
[DIA] I figured something like
this would happen to you.

285
00:14:58,833 --> 00:15:00,125
[DIA]
That's enough!

286
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,625
This farce was only successful

287
00:15:01,708 --> 00:15:03,583
because of the efforts of
previous school idols,

288
00:15:03,666 --> 00:15:05,333
and the good will
of this community!

289
00:15:05,416 --> 00:15:07,166
And don't you dare forget it!

290
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:09,458
Becoming a school idol?
Winning Love Live?

291
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:11,500
Even if you're trying
to save Uranohoshi,

292
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:15,166
who are you kidding? Why bother.
Those things are impossible.

293
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:18,791
So you're saying that it's
better to just give up?

294
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:22,625
I think that's exactly
what needs to happen.

295
00:15:24,041 --> 00:15:25,708
[KANAN gasps]

296
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,916
Kanan...

297
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,833
[laughs]

298
00:15:46,333 --> 00:15:50,708
It needs to stop before
someone gets hurt.

299
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:54,125
I'm never going to give up.

300
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:57,000
I won't stop fighting
for you and Dia!

301
00:15:57,083 --> 00:16:00,666
There has to be a way to
get our friendship back!

302
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,708
I can't stop trying.

303
00:16:02,791 --> 00:16:06,250
You two mean more
to me than anything.

304
00:16:06,333 --> 00:16:08,041
[MARI cries]

305
00:16:10,541 --> 00:16:13,041
[MITO] I went ahead and ran
some bath water for you!

306
00:16:13,125 --> 00:16:13,958
[CHIKA]
Thanks.

307
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,791
You take it easy
too, okay, Riko?

308
00:16:15,875 --> 00:16:19,041
I will. Thanks again
for the ride.

309
00:16:19,125 --> 00:16:20,083
Chika?

310
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,000
--[CHIKA] Huh?
--[RIKO] You okay?

311
00:16:23,083 --> 00:16:26,416
[CHIKA] Eh. I'll think
everything over.

312
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:28,375
I need to get my
act together, right?

313
00:16:28,458 --> 00:16:31,375
Or it'll make things
harder for the others.

314
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:39,166
Chika...

315
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:42,041
[YOSHIKO]
That's all for now.

316
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,541
[RUBY]
One and two. One and--

317
00:16:47,625 --> 00:16:49,000
[RUBY yelps]

318
00:16:50,458 --> 00:16:52,833
[DIA] Yes. I gave
it to her straight.

319
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,916
[KANAN]
Okay.

320
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:58,208
[DIA]
This is what you wanted, right?

321
00:17:00,625 --> 00:17:02,541
What you wanted.

322
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,166
[YOU]
Hold on.

323
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,958
We giving up?

324
00:17:10,583 --> 00:17:13,958
Tell us. Are we giving up?

325
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:31,833
It's a little chilly out there.

326
00:17:31,916 --> 00:17:33,500
[RIKO]
Mm.

327
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,666
[CHIKA gasps]

328
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,583
[birds chirping]

329
00:18:16,041 --> 00:18:19,000
[gasps] Where's she going?

330
00:18:24,291 --> 00:18:25,833
[CHIKA grunts]

331
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,416
[RIKO panting]
Chika!

332
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:36,416
Chika! Chika!

333
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,125
Chika!

334
00:18:38,208 --> 00:18:41,833
[inhales] Huh? What's wrong?

335
00:18:41,916 --> 00:18:46,333
[sighs] What on earth
are you doing?!

336
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:50,875
Um... I thought I might be
able to find something out here.

337
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:51,750
[RIKO]
What?

338
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,333
Remember?

339
00:18:53,416 --> 00:18:55,833
We all dove in together to help
you find the sound of the ocean.

340
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,458
I decided to give
it a try to see

341
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,416
if I could find something too.

342
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,208
[RIKO]
Oh yeah?

343
00:19:01,291 --> 00:19:02,791
[CHIKA]
Mm-hm!

344
00:19:04,916 --> 00:19:06,833
Well, have you found anything?

345
00:19:06,916 --> 00:19:08,833
Still looking. Nothing yet.

346
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,041
You sure?

347
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:12,625
[CHIKA] Mm-hm. I'm gonna
keep looking though.

348
00:19:12,708 --> 00:19:15,083
It's okay. I don't
mind the search.

349
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:17,458
Just gotta continue.

350
00:19:17,541 --> 00:19:18,666
It's tough.

351
00:19:18,750 --> 00:19:20,625
Most of the time I can't
see what's up ahead.

352
00:19:20,708 --> 00:19:23,041
But I try to keep
swimming along.

353
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,791
It's a zero right now,
but one day,

354
00:19:25,875 --> 00:19:30,625
it might turn into a one or a
ten, that's why I can't stop.

355
00:19:30,708 --> 00:19:35,625
If I give it all up, I'll never
know how much we can grow.

356
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,333
Chika...

357
00:19:37,416 --> 00:19:40,041
[CHIKA] How could I stop
being a school idol now?

358
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:44,791
We have so far to go!
Our score was a zero!

359
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,791
A zero.

360
00:19:47,708 --> 00:19:49,333
We worked so hard.

361
00:19:49,416 --> 00:19:51,500
And it should've counted
for something more.

362
00:19:51,583 --> 00:19:54,833
We practiced so much together,
we made our costumes, our songs,

363
00:19:54,916 --> 00:19:58,208
and even that video.
We pushed ourselves every day

364
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:01,791
and I can't understand
why that wasn't enough.

365
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:06,375
The only thing we wanted to do
was go out there and shine!

366
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:09,833
[gasps]

367
00:20:09,916 --> 00:20:11,750
I can't believe we
ended up with a zero!

368
00:20:11,833 --> 00:20:14,416
A zero? No!

369
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:15,125
[gasps]

370
00:20:15,208 --> 00:20:17,041
This is so frustrating!

371
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:18,458
I don't care if
it's different now

372
00:20:18,541 --> 00:20:20,875
than it used to be back then!

373
00:20:20,958 --> 00:20:24,708
It's not fair.
We deserved so much more.

374
00:20:24,791 --> 00:20:28,458
[cries] I just can't stand it.

375
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:34,666
[RIKO]
I'm so relieved.

376
00:20:34,750 --> 00:20:37,333
It's not good for you
to hold it all inside.

377
00:20:37,416 --> 00:20:39,708
I'm supposed to be the one
who cheers you all up!

378
00:20:39,791 --> 00:20:41,791
I don't wanna upset you more!

379
00:20:41,875 --> 00:20:44,000
I was the one who talked
you all into this!

380
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:45,375
We put ourselves out there

381
00:20:45,458 --> 00:20:47,208
and we don't have
anything to show for it!

382
00:20:47,291 --> 00:20:49,791
That's why I've
gotta keep going!

383
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:55,291
That's why... I have to try!

384
00:20:55,375 --> 00:20:58,375
Listen to me.
You didn't make us join.

385
00:20:58,458 --> 00:21:00,583
All of us wanted to
try something new.

386
00:21:00,666 --> 00:21:02,541
We wanted to do this.

387
00:21:02,625 --> 00:21:04,458
I did.

388
00:21:04,541 --> 00:21:05,958
[gasps]

389
00:21:06,041 --> 00:21:08,291
[RIKO]
You did. Ruby did.

390
00:21:08,375 --> 00:21:09,750
Hanamaru did.

391
00:21:09,833 --> 00:21:11,750
And even Yoshiko did!

392
00:21:11,833 --> 00:21:13,500
[YOU]
Ahoy!

393
00:21:13,583 --> 00:21:15,375
[CHIKA]
But...

394
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,666
We're here for you.

395
00:21:16,750 --> 00:21:18,208
You can always
share your feelings

396
00:21:18,291 --> 00:21:20,416
because all of us are
in this together now!

397
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,125
[YOU]
Chika!

398
00:21:22,708 --> 00:21:23,583
[HANAMARU]
Zura!

399
00:21:23,666 --> 00:21:25,958
[GIRLS laughing]

400
00:21:26,041 --> 00:21:30,541
[RIKO] Win or lose we'll never
leave you. We're friends!

401
00:21:30,625 --> 00:21:33,083
[CHIKA cries]

402
00:21:33,166 --> 00:21:35,125
[GIRLS laugh]

403
00:21:42,125 --> 00:21:44,208
I'm not sure we'll be
able to go from zeros

404
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,208
to the winners' circle just yet.

405
00:21:46,291 --> 00:21:47,750
It's okay.

406
00:21:47,833 --> 00:21:50,083
I think we might be able to
work our way to a one though.

407
00:21:50,166 --> 00:21:52,250
I want to see if we
can make that happen.

408
00:21:52,333 --> 00:21:54,750
We all feel that way.

409
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,208
Uh?

410
00:21:59,291 --> 00:22:02,125
[ALL gasping]

411
00:22:04,083 --> 00:22:05,916
Yeah!
