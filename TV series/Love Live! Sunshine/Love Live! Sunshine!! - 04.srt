Ever since I was a little girl,

00:00:19,833 --> 00:00:23,000
I was always the quiet
one who played alone.

3
00:00:23,083 --> 00:00:25,291
I wasn't all that
good at sports,

4
00:00:25,375 --> 00:00:28,750
and I was cast as a tree
in the school play.

[HANAMARU]
It wasn't so bad.

6
00:00:33,166 --> 00:00:36,041
I got kinda used to spendin'
time by myself.

7
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:40,750
I started to love readin' more
than anything else in the world.

8
00:00:40,833 --> 00:00:45,541
Books were my happy place,
and the library was a paradise!

00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:47,958
I loved being whisked away!

10
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:53,125
I felt my imagination growin'
with every story I read.

I'd always feel a
little lonely inside.

After everything
we've been through

don't have enough members.

The director said okay so that
means we're in the clear!

Well, she didn't just say okay.

She could hardly
contain herself!

32
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:22,250
It seems a little strange
that she's this eager

33
00:03:22,333 --> 00:03:24,291
to help us with this stuff.
Don't you think so?

34
00:03:24,375 --> 00:03:27,000
Maybe she's just a huge
fan of school idols.

No, I think there might
be more to it than that.

She did say we'd have to clean
the room before using it.

We deserve so much
better than this!

Oh, no! That's not my thing.

out sometimes, too!

all the way to the top?

So, what's up? I've never
seen you here before.

Well, we're in training!

It's all a part of
being school idols!

Oh.

Well, keep up the good work!

she's not even out of breath.

farther along than you are.

You want to be a school idol?

Yup!

But why?

No, not at all! But I could've
sworn you told me yesterday

interested in joining them.

Yeah, but then I remembered how
much fun we had watchin' 'em!

Yeah, we could try it together.

[RUBY] But I'm worried
I might be too shy.

00:10:16,875 --> 00:10:20,333
with me joining the

[CHIKA]
Huh?

Okay, it's like this...

213
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,083
It means they're trying
out the School Idol Club

214
00:11:00,166 --> 00:11:02,166
to see if they like it.
If they have a good time,

215
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:04,291
they might join, but if
it's not their thing,

216
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:05,833
they'll be free to go.

I'm afraid so.
Things are complicated.

Because of the student

Uh! Yeah.

from other school idols.

What about composing songs?

Guess we'll have to
squeeze that in

between everything
else on the schedule.

I feel like a real school idol

when we talk about
this kinda stuff!

237

Any idea where we're
actually going to practice?

Fly ball! Pick it up!

00:11:49,958 --> 00:11:52,166
Both the courtyard and
field are taken already,

242
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:54,291
and the club room is way
too small to dance in.

243
00:11:54,375 --> 00:11:56,166
Why don't we just
practice at the beach?

244
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,875
If you think about
all the time we'd waste

245
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,666
travelling there, it
makes more sense

246
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,375
to figure out a place
here at school.

247

Maybe the rooftop would work!

248

I never thought of that.

249
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:05,875
There's a lot of room to dance,

250
00:12:05,958 --> 00:12:08,000
and that's where Mu's
always practiced too!

00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,958
In that case, here's
your chance to shine!

324
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:21,625
Now, go on up!

325
00:15:21,708 --> 00:15:24,500
But, I can't go alone.

326
00:15:24,583 --> 00:15:26,375
Go.

327
00:15:39,041 --> 00:15:41,291
[HANAMARU] The girl who spent
all her time in the library

328
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:43,500
with me always put others first.

329
00:15:43,583 --> 00:15:47,166
It was nice of her, but she'd
often forget her own needs.

330
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,583
And be unfair to herself.

331
00:15:49,666 --> 00:15:51,416
All the dreams she had...

332
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:53,500
All the high hopes
for her future...

333
00:15:53,583 --> 00:15:58,333
...were locked away in the
deepest parts of her soul.

334
00:15:58,416 --> 00:16:01,875
I wanted to figure out a way to
pry open the door to her heart,

335
00:16:01,958 --> 00:16:07,416
and take away all her fears.

336
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:11,666
To let loose the light inside,
so it could come floodin' out.

337
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,583
[RUBY panting]

338
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,208
--[CHIKA] You're almost here!
--[RIKO] Go, Ruby!

339
00:16:15,291 --> 00:16:18,250
[RUBY panting]

340
00:16:18,333 --> 00:16:21,625
[HANAMARU] I knew it could make
every corner of the world shine.

341
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,583
It would brighten the sky.

342
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,375
She'd be happy, and
the universe would glow!

343
00:16:27,458 --> 00:16:31,416
[RUBY gasping, laughing]

344
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,708
[HANAMARU]
Her joy... That was my dream.

345
00:16:34,791 --> 00:16:42,375
[panting] I did it. I did it!

346
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,083
And on your first try, too!

347
00:16:44,166 --> 00:16:46,291
Look, Ruby!

348
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:52,291
[gasping]

349
00:16:52,375 --> 00:16:53,875
Yeah, we did it!

350
00:16:53,958 --> 00:16:57,750
We made it to the very top!

351
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,791
[DIA]
Did you need something?

352
00:17:05,875 --> 00:17:08,916
You must have called me
here for a reason.

353
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,250
I did. And I hope that
you'll hear me out.

354
00:17:19,333 --> 00:17:21,000
Your sister has some
things on her mind

355
00:17:21,083 --> 00:17:23,666
and she really needs
to talk to you.

356
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,208
What do you mean?

357
00:17:34,583 --> 00:17:35,958
Oh, Ruby.

358
00:17:36,041 --> 00:17:38,541
I already know.

359
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:39,083
[RUBY]
Sis?

360
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:41,333
[gasping]

361
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:42,416
[DIA]
Ruby?

362
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,458
Hey Dia.

363
00:17:43,541 --> 00:17:45,583
What are you doing here?

364
00:17:45,666 --> 00:17:47,916
Tell me why you're
here with them, now.

365
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,666
I, uh, I was trying, I mean...

366
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,166
Don't be upset!
It's just a trial!

367
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:55,333
I'll do it.

368
00:17:55,416 --> 00:17:57,208
Okay...

369
00:18:04,541 --> 00:18:07,000
Hear me out.

370
00:18:12,583 --> 00:18:14,458
Don't you see?

371
00:18:14,541 --> 00:18:16,791
I want this!

372
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,458
[bell chimes]

373
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:22,750
[door clicks]

374
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,458
[MARI]
That's wonderful.

375
00:18:26,541 --> 00:18:31,625
Her dream finally came true.

376
00:18:31,708 --> 00:18:34,041
[DIA]
What are you talking about?

377
00:18:39,125 --> 00:18:41,625
Please let me join the club!

378
00:18:41,708 --> 00:18:43,000
Without a doubt!

379
00:18:43,083 --> 00:18:44,208
Thanks!

380
00:18:44,291 --> 00:18:46,041
I'll do my best!

381
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,958
What about Hanamaru?
Is she not joining?

382
00:18:55,375 --> 00:18:59,000
[HANAMARU] And so,
I guess my story ends here.

383
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,958
[HANAMARU]
The dream I had just came true.

384
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:13,250
So I'm comin' back
to the world of books.

385
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,250
I'm alone again.

386
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,125
That's okay.

387
00:19:33,750 --> 00:19:35,708
[HANAMARU]
Bye-bye.

388
00:19:38,125 --> 00:19:39,333
I saw, ya know!

389
00:19:39,416 --> 00:19:41,000
[gasps]

390
00:19:43,625 --> 00:19:44,791
What'd you say?

391
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:46,125
I noticed!

392
00:19:46,208 --> 00:19:48,458
I saw it all when you
thought I wasn't looking!

393
00:19:48,541 --> 00:19:50,208
All that time I thought
you were pretending

394
00:19:50,291 --> 00:19:53,291
you wanted to be a school
idol, because of me!

395
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:55,958
I was worried you were
pushing yourself too hard,

396
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:59,458
for something you didn't
even care about!

397
00:20:01,875 --> 00:20:06,166
[RUBY]
But then, when we were dancing,

398
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:08,500
and when we were on the rooftop,

399
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:12,458
and we were all
spending time together...

400
00:20:12,541 --> 00:20:15,166
...I noticed that
you looked happy!

401
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,125
[HANAMARU]
Uh.

402
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:18,916
[RUBY]
And I realized,

403
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,166
you love school idols
as much as me!

404
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,708
You only thought it was
something you wouldn't

405
00:20:22,791 --> 00:20:25,250
like to do, but you
don't have to be alone!

406
00:20:25,333 --> 00:20:28,583
[gasps] It's not true.

407
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:29,958
I don't like them.

408
00:20:30,041 --> 00:20:34,458
Then why spend so much
time reading that magazine?

409
00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:35,791
[HANAMARU]
It's because...

410
00:20:35,875 --> 00:20:37,291
[footsteps]

411
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:38,541
[RUBY]
Listen to me!

412
00:20:38,625 --> 00:20:40,291
I've always thought it
would be so wonderful

413
00:20:40,375 --> 00:20:42,833
to become a school idol
with you! Side by side!

414
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:46,125
We could help each
other work hard!

415
00:20:46,208 --> 00:20:48,833
I wouldn't be able to
do anything like that.

416
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,208
I don't know how, zura.

417
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:52,666
I'd mess it up.

418
00:20:52,750 --> 00:20:55,166
You know the girl you
keep looking at? Rin?

419
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,333
She didn't think
she would make

420
00:20:56,416 --> 00:21:01,125
a good school idol either,
but look at her!

421
00:21:01,208 --> 00:21:05,791
[RIKO] She loved it, so she
decided to give it a try.

422
00:21:05,875 --> 00:21:07,208
I don't think there's
anything wrong

423
00:21:07,291 --> 00:21:10,000
with starting out that way.

424
00:21:10,083 --> 00:21:11,708
[gasps]

425
00:21:12,791 --> 00:21:14,000
[RUBY]
Please!

426
00:21:14,083 --> 00:21:16,041
Without you, this
doesn't feel right!

427
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:19,916
Be a school idol with me!

428
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,583
I'm scared. Can I even do it?

429
00:21:22,666 --> 00:21:24,583
[CHIKA] I ask myself
the same question.

430
00:21:24,666 --> 00:21:26,166
Uh?

431
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:29,083
Nobody really knows if they can
or can't do something they like.

432
00:21:29,166 --> 00:21:31,875
Where's the fun if
you don't try though?

433
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,750
[RUBY laughs]

434
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,416
[BOTH laughing]

435
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:40,208
[CHIKA laughs]

436
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,583
[CHIKA] 
Okey-doke!

437
00:21:57,666 --> 00:21:59,125
You ready?

438
00:21:59,208 --> 00:22:01,166
Let's go!

439
00:22:04,833 --> 00:22:07,875
4,999th place? No way.

440
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:11,666
So there are 4,998
groups above us?

441
00:22:11,750 --> 00:22:13,166
That's so many!

442
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:15,250
[HANAMARU]
Hm. Well!

443
00:22:15,333 --> 00:22:16,625
Better start running!

444
00:22:16,708 --> 00:22:17,583
Zura!

445
00:22:17,666 --> 00:22:18,416
[YOU, CHIKA, RIKO]
Yeah!

446
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:20,083
[RUBY laughs]

447
00:23:47,208 --> 00:23:50,625
[YOSHIKO]
Next time, "Yohane Descends."
