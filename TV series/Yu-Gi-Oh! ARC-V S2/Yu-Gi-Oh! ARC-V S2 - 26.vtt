WEBVTT

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:03.900
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.266
<i>Ya'll ready?</i>

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:07.866
We've reached the last duel
of the first round!

00:00:07.866 --> 00:00:11.433
Give it up for that brooding
bad boy, Shay Obsidian!

00:00:11.433 --> 00:00:15.100
And his red‐headed rival,
Dennis MacField!

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.200
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:20.133
Time to learn
who you really are!

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:24.066
Witness the assent of
Raidraptor ‐ Revolution Falcon!

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.700
Take out Trapeze Magician!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.266
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:00:31.266 --> 00:00:33.333
Shay's not treating this
like a duel.

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.033
He's battling
like it's an all‐out war!

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:43.633
It's time for the real Dennis
to now be revealed!

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:46.966
Is this what you
wanted to see?

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.733
Polymerization...

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.000
I knew it!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.900
Only duelists from a certain
dimension use that card!

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.866
Now that the cat's out of
the bag,

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:58.633
I can hit you
with everything I've got!

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:00.066
I Fusion Summon...

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:05.600
The ground shaking
Chaos Ancient Gear Giant!

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.566
I knew you were from
the Fusion Dimension!

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.033
You have someone from the Fusion
Dimension on your team?

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.733
I thought you were
fighting against them.

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:17.000
It's true we were deceived,
but at least the enemy agent

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.166
has finally been revealed.

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:22.433
Of course, there could be a
traitor on your side as well.

This duel's taking more
twists and turns

00:02:29.566 --> 00:02:31.533
than the Galloping
Gulch river!

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:34.033
And now Shay's saying that
Dennis is from some place

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.133
called the Fusion
Dimension!

00:02:36.133 --> 00:02:37.666
From Fusion...

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:40.066
Could it be true?

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:41.966
I am also convinced
there is someone

00:02:41.966 --> 00:02:44.133
from the Fusion Dimension
who has infiltrated

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:45.733
the upper echelons of your city.

00:02:45.733 --> 00:02:48.766
You certainly seem
sure of yourself, Declan.

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.700
It's as if you've
already identified

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.700
who the individual is.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.400
I have my suspicions,
as I'm sure you do as well.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.833
(throat clearing)

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:02.500
How interesting...

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.066
But I suggest we return our
attention to the Friendship Cup.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.266
Aren't you curious to see
how your Lancer

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.633
deals with this
sudden turn of events?

00:03:10.633 --> 00:03:13.333
Shay has plenty of fight
left in him..

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:15.233
An' plenty of
life points, too!

00:03:15.233 --> 00:03:18.266
He and his Revolution Falcon
look like they're ready

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.133
to swoop in fly
off with a win!

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.000
But they'll have to be
at the top of their games

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.333
to lock gears with
Dennis's Gear Giant!

00:03:24.333 --> 00:03:26.733
Just look at the size
of that feller!

00:03:26.733 --> 00:03:30.366
Why, next to him, Shay's
Falcon looks more like a
canary!

00:03:30.366 --> 00:03:32.766
Thanks to you,
I can now let loose

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:35.066
since I have nothing
left to hide!

00:03:35.066 --> 00:03:36.466
Bring it!

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:39.466
♪

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:51.566
♪

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:58.166
By the time I'm done
with your Gear Giant,

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.166
it'll be a giant heap of junk!

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.733
Is that what you said
right before our Giants

00:04:02.733 --> 00:04:04.933
bulldozed their way through
your hometown?

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:08.200
That's it!
You asked for this!

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.366
I'm activating the traps
Raidraptor ‐ Chain Lock

00:04:11.366 --> 00:04:13.533
and Raidraptor ‐ Reactor!

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.633
Since your Chaos Ancient Gear
Giant has more attack points

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:19.400
than my Raidraptor
‐ Revolution Falcon,

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.666
Chain Lock switches it into
defense mode!

00:04:25.933 --> 00:04:29.600
And when a monster changes
battle mode, Raidraptor Reactor

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.100
destroys your Giant
and deals you damage

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:33.966
equal to its attack points!

00:04:35.533 --> 00:04:38.366
Shay's moves will zero out
Dennis's life points!

00:04:38.366 --> 00:04:41.800
And send him
riding off into the sunset!

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.000
Toppling my Giant
will be harder than you think!

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.066
It's not affected by any spells
or traps you use against it!

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.400
(Melissa)
<i>Whew!</i>

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.400
For a second there,
I thought I was a goner!

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.266
Better stay on your toes,
folks!

00:05:03.266 --> 00:05:07.066
This duel's turning
downright dangerous!

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:11.433
I can't believe Dennis
is from Duel Academy.

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:14.866
Messing with a Giant
is always a bad idea!

00:05:14.866 --> 00:05:16.800
It's gonna snatch your Falcon
out of the sky

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.233
like it's a measly little fly!

00:05:19.233 --> 00:05:22.466
Shay's traps didn't slow that
Chaos Giant down one iota!

00:05:22.466 --> 00:05:24.266
He better think of something
lickety‐split

00:05:24.266 --> 00:05:26.766
or it's adios for
him and his Falcon!

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:29.233
Your Chaos Giant
isn't the unstoppable

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:30.866
war machine that you
think it is!

00:05:30.866 --> 00:05:33.666
My Falcon will use its special
ability to change its attack

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:37.033
and defense points to zero
and render it totally harmless!

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.233
Nice try!

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:40.300
But when Chaos Giant attacks,

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.000
it negates all of your monster's
special abilities!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.866
Terrific.

00:05:51.233 --> 00:05:55.766
(Dennis)Say Shay, all this
destruction remind you of
anything?

00:05:55.766 --> 00:05:57.333
Looks like you're about
to get thrashed

00:05:57.333 --> 00:05:59.933
just like all
your friends from back home!

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.800
Nothing like a blast from
the past... am I right?

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.700
(Shay)
The day those
war machines attacked

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.966
was the worst day
of my life.

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.100
They were relentless...

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.000
destroying everything
in their path.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.400
Our homes,
reduced to rubble.

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:21.800
But we wouldn't give up.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.266
We stood our ground...

00:06:24.266 --> 00:06:26.866
friends fighting
side by side.

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.066
Yuto...

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:41.066
(gasping throughout)

00:06:49.933 --> 00:06:53.166
I can feel what Yuto
went through...

00:06:53.166 --> 00:06:55.533
All that devastation...

00:06:55.533 --> 00:06:57.433
It's horrible.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:04.733
Once my Giant's through
playing around with your Dragon,

00:07:04.733 --> 00:07:07.333
the rest of your life points
will be liquidated,

00:07:07.333 --> 00:07:09.200
terminating this duel!

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.533
It's been real, Shay.

00:07:10.533 --> 00:07:11.666
Adios!

00:07:14.166 --> 00:07:15.900
(Mellisa)
<i>This duel's done!</i>

00:07:24.133 --> 00:07:25.833
<i>This duel's done!</i>

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:29.433
<i>Huh?</i>

00:07:33.166 --> 00:07:34.100
What's this?

00:07:35.166 --> 00:07:37.033
I used a special ability...

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:39.733
I was able to summon
Raidraptor ‐ Force Strix

00:07:39.733 --> 00:07:41.000
and decrease the amount
of damage I took.

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.500
For each spell
and trap on my field,

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:47.400
I was able to lower
the damage by 100.

00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.666
<i>My, my, my...</i>

00:07:48.666 --> 00:07:50.800
NNIt looked like it
wascurtains for 'ol Shay,

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:52.700
NNbut he's still
hanging onby a thread!

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.233
You may have a lot more
fight than most of your people,

00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:59.600
but against my Chaos Giant,
it won't matter!

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.833
Your Raidraptor can't avoid
its devastating power!

00:08:02.833 --> 00:08:05.500
Say bye‐bye to your birdie!

00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:07.133
You'd be wise to quit,

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:09.900
but "wise" isn't exactly
in your repertoire.

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:13.433
I'm wise enough to know
that you're a lowdown snake.

00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:16.200
And also wise enough to know
I can't back down...

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.133
until you crawl back in
the hole where you came from!

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.900
That's the spirit, Shay!

00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.733
Never cave in!

00:08:22.733 --> 00:08:25.333
You didn't get to be the top
of your class by giving up,

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:26.733
am I right?

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:27.733
What did you say!?

00:08:27.733 --> 00:08:30.833
Oh, I know a lot
about your past.

00:08:30.833 --> 00:08:33.733
You and I have a very
special someone in common.

00:08:33.733 --> 00:08:35.033
Yep...

00:08:35.033 --> 00:08:37.800
I bet you didn't know that I was
in Heartland for months

00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:41.433
before the invasion,
looking for a certain girl.

00:08:41.433 --> 00:08:43.666
This is gonna be snaptastic!

00:08:43.666 --> 00:08:46.633
But before I blow your minds,
I'll first need a volunteer

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:49.233
from the audience
to hop up here and join me!

00:08:55.333 --> 00:08:56.833
Yeehaw!

00:08:56.833 --> 00:08:59.266
(Dennis)
Trapeze Magician's picked you!

00:08:59.266 --> 00:09:01.600
I'd be deeply honored
if you would assist me

00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.000
in a little vanishing act
I've been working on.

00:09:06.266 --> 00:09:09.433
I came to the Xyz Dimension
on a mission,

00:09:09.433 --> 00:09:11.633
looking for a special someone.

00:09:11.633 --> 00:09:13.066
And one day I found her.

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:16.533
And at that point, the time for
fun and games was over

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:18.266
because once I
located my target,

00:09:18.266 --> 00:09:20.100
my mission had to commence
full force.

00:09:41.733 --> 00:09:43.500
Nice of you
to drop in, Yuri.

00:09:44.633 --> 00:09:46.366
So, where's my prize?

00:09:48.366 --> 00:09:49.566
That way.

00:09:52.533 --> 00:09:54.666
She's holed up
in the stadium?

00:09:54.666 --> 00:09:56.066
That's right.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:58.766
She and the rest
of the resistance.

00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:06.366
There she is.

00:10:06.366 --> 00:10:08.133
The one with the bracelet
on her wrist.

00:10:14.333 --> 00:10:16.233
Hi.

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:18.200
You take it from here.

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:20.500
She's a good girl,
so would you please promise me

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.700
that you'll take it easy
on her, okay?

00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:24.800
I make no such promise...

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.133
Hopefully she puts up
a little struggle.

00:10:27.133 --> 00:10:29.066
I always love a challenge.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.000
Nowhere left to run.

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.533
What a shame.

00:10:42.533 --> 00:10:44.900
I enjoy a good game
of hide and seek...

00:10:46.033 --> 00:10:48.400
Good, you're putting up
a fight.

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.166
If you beat me,
you can keep running.

00:10:52.166 --> 00:10:55.766
But if I win, you'll have to
come along quietly.

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:57.566
(laughing)

00:10:57.566 --> 00:10:59.533
Or not.

00:11:02.033 --> 00:11:03.833
The girl's name...

00:11:03.833 --> 00:11:04.966
was Lulu.

00:11:04.966 --> 00:11:06.366
Lulu?

00:11:06.366 --> 00:11:08.366
Your wittle baby sister.

00:11:08.366 --> 00:11:10.300
(gasping)

00:11:10.300 --> 00:11:11.866
Surprise!

00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:28.266
You abducted Lulu?

00:11:28.266 --> 00:11:30.333
Eh, only indirectly...

00:11:30.333 --> 00:11:31.866
If they touch
a hair on her head

00:11:31.866 --> 00:11:34.200
you're gonna wish you never
picked up a duel disk!

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.566
I'm out of the loop
as far as she's concerned.

00:11:36.566 --> 00:11:39.000
But if you're stressed about
your sis why don't you just head

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.100
to Fusion now and rescue her
from Duel Academy?

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:43.900
You'd better get going!

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:45.500
The minutes
are ticking away.

00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.000
If you delay too long,
it may be too late to save her.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.333
Oh, I will!

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:51.866
But not before I crush you

00:11:51.866 --> 00:11:54.300
and make you pay
for taking my sister away!

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:57.066
It's time to feel
the pain of my people!

00:11:57.066 --> 00:11:59.366
This won't take long...

00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:00.466
I promise!

00:12:01.966 --> 00:12:07.600
I activate the spell card
Rank‐Up‐Magic Soul Shave Force!

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.900
I give up half my life points...

00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:12.833
and summon Revolution Falcon
from my graveyard!

00:12:16.233 --> 00:12:18.433
Then I use it
to build the Overlay Network!

00:12:23.033 --> 00:12:26.600
You Fusion Warriors built
the ultimate war machine...

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.900
So I'll take it down using an
ultimate monster of my own!

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:32.433
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:12:32.433 --> 00:12:34.400
You're cleared
for takeoff...

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.800
Raidraptor ‐ Satellite
Cannon Falcon!

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.333
(Melissa)
<i>Thundering bullfrogs!</i>

00:12:41.333 --> 00:12:44.333
Shay started out
empty‐handed, but now he's got a
monster

00:12:44.333 --> 00:12:45.966
no one would want
to wrestle with!

00:12:55.866 --> 00:12:58.933
You and your Academy cronies
hunted down my friends

00:12:58.933 --> 00:13:01.533
and then sealed
them all inside cards!

00:13:01.533 --> 00:13:03.933
This duel is my chance
to finally avenge them...

00:13:03.933 --> 00:13:06.433
by taking you down
once and for all!

00:13:06.433 --> 00:13:10.400
I activate Cannon Falcon's
special ability!

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.100
Once per turn my Raidraptor ‐
Satellite Cannon Falcon

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.400
can use an Overlay Unit
to weaken

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:18.633
your Chaos Ancient Gear Giant.

00:13:18.633 --> 00:13:20.200
Sorry, not impressed!

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.733
Losing 800 attack points

00:13:21.733 --> 00:13:25.300
for every Raidraptor in my
graveyard isn't impressive?

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.000
There are five Raid Raptors
in my graveyard!

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.166
Now...

00:13:29.166 --> 00:13:32.433
Satellite Cannon Falcon,
get set to strike!

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:45.833
Fire one!

00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:51.500
This is for my friends
whose souls you took!

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.700
I can't make you feel
the fear my friends felt,

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.066
<i>but I'll do my best!</i>

00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:03.666
<i>Fire two!</i>

00:14:08.033 --> 00:14:09.633
This is for Lulu!

00:14:14.533 --> 00:14:17.066
Cowards like you,
who hide behind lies

00:14:17.066 --> 00:14:19.700
and feed on the weak, will pay!

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:20.900
Grr...

00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:23.200
Fire three!
Feel my fury!

00:14:35.933 --> 00:14:37.533
This'll cool your Cannon!

00:14:39.666 --> 00:14:41.433
(Melissa)
<i>That Action Card was his,</i>

00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:44.133
if it weren't for that
speed bump.

00:14:44.133 --> 00:14:47.400
And this next blast
is for my best friend, Yuto!

00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:50.333
He detested you Fusion Warrior
lowlifes with a passion

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:51.266
greater than mine!

00:14:52.766 --> 00:14:54.133
So much hatred...

00:14:54.133 --> 00:14:56.733
Fire four, for Yuto!

00:15:09.266 --> 00:15:13.500
He'll never
hurt us again.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:17.033
I...
get it, but...

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:18.966
But dueling...

00:15:18.966 --> 00:15:22.633
to get... revenge...

00:15:22.633 --> 00:15:23.966
on your enemies...

00:15:23.966 --> 00:15:25.566
It is not
the answer.

00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.000
I couldn't get the Action Card
the first time,

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.166
but the second time's the charm.

00:15:40.166 --> 00:15:41.300
Huh?
Ahh!

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:47.633
Ahhhhhhh!

00:15:47.633 --> 00:15:49.333
(Melissa)
<i>Well, hang me up to dry!</i>

00:15:49.333 --> 00:15:51.866
Looks like Dennis drew
the short straw again!

00:16:00.666 --> 00:16:02.000
Missed it!

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.400
These potholes are
wreaking havoc on my game,

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:08.800
if I drive over one more bump
I'm going to lose my mind!

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:10.566
No matter how much
I make you suffer,

00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:12.733
it won't make up for
all of the pain you caused,

00:16:12.733 --> 00:16:14.433
but at least I'll get
to reap my revenge!

00:16:15.633 --> 00:16:17.033
No, Shay!
Back off!

00:16:17.033 --> 00:16:18.833
Number five, fire!

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.100
And now...

00:16:32.100 --> 00:16:35.133
Cannon Falcon,
attack and take out Dennis!

00:16:42.300 --> 00:16:45.433
(Melissa)
I've seen some high‐flying
monsters in my day,

00:16:45.433 --> 00:16:47.266
but this one
takes the ranch!

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:50.033
No wonder it's called
a Satellite Cannon!

00:16:50.033 --> 00:16:52.400
It's heading straight out
of the stratosphere...

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.500
<i>What is it gonna do?</i>

00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:03.666
Dennis, you had your fun,
capturing my sister,

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:05.766
playing with
the lives of my friends!

00:17:05.766 --> 00:17:07.066
Well, no more!

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:10.933
A new day is rising and with it
will come your downfall!

00:17:10.933 --> 00:17:12.533
(Melissa)
<i>Oh, my!</i>

00:17:12.533 --> 00:17:15.466
Shay's new monster is
certainly a sight to
behold...

00:17:15.466 --> 00:17:18.233
In fact,
I think the entire planet

00:17:18.233 --> 00:17:21.466
is getting a look see
at its magnificence!

00:17:21.466 --> 00:17:24.733
And I'm betting Dennis is
about to get an eyeful of
skyfull

00:17:24.733 --> 00:17:27.733
when this monster
fires up its fury!

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.400
For all the victims
you hunted down...

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.666
this is payback!

00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.600
Go Vengeful Vengeance!

00:18:01.966 --> 00:18:03.900
(screaming)

00:18:08.633 --> 00:18:11.866
(cheering)

00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:17.100
You win, Shay.
Can we call it even?

00:18:18.766 --> 00:18:20.300
I don't like bikes anymore.

00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:23.966
It's Shay that
wins the day!

00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:26.366
<i>Boy, oh, boy!</i>

00:18:26.366 --> 00:18:27.933
What a rooting
tooting finish

00:18:27.933 --> 00:18:30.400
for the first round
of the Friendship Cup!

00:18:50.266 --> 00:18:52.200
(whimpering)

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:55.866
It certainly was
a great duel,

00:18:55.866 --> 00:18:57.933
but who's gonna
clean it all up?

00:18:57.933 --> 00:18:59.166
<i>Not me!</i>

00:19:03.266 --> 00:19:06.633
Now I'm gonna do to you
what you did to all my friends.

00:19:06.633 --> 00:19:09.566
Hope you enjoy living the rest
of your life inside a card.

00:19:15.233 --> 00:19:17.700
Why won't my Duel Disk
turn you into a card?

00:19:21.333 --> 00:19:22.566
Declan!

00:19:22.566 --> 00:19:24.833
He sabotaged my Disk!

00:19:24.833 --> 00:19:28.333
I want Dennis MacField
taken into custody at once.

00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:32.733
Cool it!

00:19:32.733 --> 00:19:34.033
Hey, lemme go!

00:19:35.533 --> 00:19:38.333
The Professor must have sent
Dennis to capture me as well.

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.700
So if Duel Academy captured
both Lulu, and Rin...

00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:47.233
They must want me
and Celina as well.

00:19:47.233 --> 00:19:49.533
But what do they want with us?

00:19:51.533 --> 00:19:52.900
Where are you going?

00:19:52.900 --> 00:19:54.433
To speak
with Dennis.

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:56.000
I have...questions.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:20:01.600
Or maybe you don't want me
to find the answers?

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:04.566
(man)
The situation
is extremely delicate.

00:20:04.566 --> 00:20:08.833
(man 2)
You must understand that our
city is on the brink of chaos.

00:20:08.833 --> 00:20:12.100
(woman)
Unfortunately, we cannot allow
you to take any action

00:20:12.100 --> 00:20:14.366
that might lead
to further disorder.

00:20:14.366 --> 00:20:16.433
(man 3)
It is a matter
of public safety.

00:20:16.433 --> 00:20:18.066
Isn't that right, Presider?

00:20:18.066 --> 00:20:19.600
Indeed.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:21.966
We simply cannot afford
any disturbance,

00:20:21.966 --> 00:20:25.533
especially one that might draw
us into an interdimensional war.

00:20:25.533 --> 00:20:28.566
I'm sure you understand, Declan.

00:20:38.466 --> 00:20:40.100
Wow...

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.366
I sensed a lot of anger
within Yuto,

00:20:42.366 --> 00:20:43.700
but he's the one who told me

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.233
to keep dueltaining
to bring joy to the world.

00:20:46.233 --> 00:20:48.466
Because he knew that even with
all his anger,

00:20:48.466 --> 00:20:51.433
he wanted to change
for the better and that revenge

00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:53.566
wasn't the right way
to solve our problems.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:59.033
And Yuto was right.

00:20:59.033 --> 00:21:01.766
There has to be another way!

00:21:01.766 --> 00:21:04.066
I have to find some way
to stop this war

00:21:04.066 --> 00:21:06.266
and bring all
the dimensions together!

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:08.200
And I'm gonna find it!
