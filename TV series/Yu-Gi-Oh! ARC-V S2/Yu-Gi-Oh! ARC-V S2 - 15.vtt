00:00:01.266 --> 00:00:03.000
(Zuzu)
Hey, Yugo! You keep speeding
like this

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.166
and the Duel Chasers'll be
after us again!

00:00:05.166 --> 00:00:07.200
You kiddin' me, Zuzu?

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.633
They wouldn't dare hassle

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.700
two Friendship Cup headliners
like us.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.100
Speaking of...

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.133
Looks like the opening
ceremony's about to start!

00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:16.933
Hold on tight, 'cause we're
going supersonic!

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:19.866
(revving)
(shrieking)

00:00:21.633 --> 00:00:23.000
(beeping)

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.966
Sir, we've located your
twoduelists of interest.

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.500
Would you like
usto detain them?

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.600
No, no, just keep an eye
on them for now.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.333
After all,

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.433
the game is only now just
beginning.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.300
And trust me,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.400
things are about to get
far more interesting.

(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>Howdy, folks!</i>

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:49.566
Welcome to
the Openin' Ceremonies

00:01:49.566 --> 00:01:52.100
of the rootin‐est,
tootin'‐est tournament in
town!

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.433
<i>The Friendship Cup!</i>

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:56.233
I'm sure you're just as
excited as two pigs in a pen

00:01:56.233 --> 00:01:58.833
to see the people of our
great city come together

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:01.900
in the spirit of friendship
and competition.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.300
Now, what say you all
put yourhands together

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.966
and make some noise for all
thecourageous competitors

00:02:06.966 --> 00:02:10.000
who'll be competing in this
rip‐roaring contest of
cards!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.633
Let's give it up!
Yee‐haw!

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.100
(crowd cheering)

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700
(cheering)

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.133
And if these folks are
psyched for that,

00:02:20.133 --> 00:02:22.500
they're gonna love
what's coming next!

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.000
I never thought I'd be down
about dueling.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.366
But I can't stop
thinking about the others.

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:31.933
I wish...

00:02:31.933 --> 00:02:34.933
I knew that they were okay.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:37.266
As you know, it's become
tradition

00:02:37.266 --> 00:02:38.766
for the Friendship Cup's
champion

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:42.266
to hold an exhibition duel just
prior to the opening ceremonies.

00:02:42.266 --> 00:02:44.600
I humbly propose that
Yuya Sakaki

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.566
be invited to challenge
Jack Atlas.

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.166
Why me?

00:02:48.166 --> 00:02:49.566
The rest of you,
this way.

00:02:49.566 --> 00:02:51.600
Hey, where are you taking
everyone else?

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.700
They will be fine, young boy.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.433
You just focus on your match
with Mr. Atlas.

00:02:56.433 --> 00:02:59.066
You'll see them again
in the Friendship Cup.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:03.133
Until then, rest assured
knowing they are safe and sound.

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:06.133
Yes, indeed, as long as
they continue to win.

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:08.133
Correct, Presider?

00:03:08.133 --> 00:03:09.566
Correct.

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:13.133
Now, please make all of our new
guests feel at home,

00:03:13.133 --> 00:03:16.333
so long as victory rides by
their sides.

00:03:16.333 --> 00:03:17.800
Don't you waste a brain cell

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.466
worrying about Gong
and the rest of us.

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:21.133
We'll be good to go, promise.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:22.800
How do they not realize
that Yuya's

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.533
just the opening act
and I'm the headliner?

00:03:25.533 --> 00:03:28.900
Yuya, you had better crush
Jack Atlas, that traitor!

00:03:32.666 --> 00:03:35.333
Wow, Crow sure was angry.

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.766
Huh? Hey.

00:03:38.766 --> 00:03:41.300
What do you know about
Jack Atlas?

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:43.033
Nothing special.

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:46.066
Aw, come on, tell me.

00:03:46.066 --> 00:03:48.433
Isn't he a big
duel star around here?

00:03:48.433 --> 00:03:51.700
Jack's not just a star,
he's a superstar.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.900
Sounds like I got my work
cut out for me.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:55.466
I didn't want to
say anything

00:03:55.466 --> 00:03:57.533
because I didn't want
to scare you with the truth.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.300
Jack's the best dualist
this city has ever seen.

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.700
He's unbeatable.

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.233
Unbeatable, huh?

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:07.266
I guess that is
kind of scary.

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:09.933
But then again, it's kind of
exciting, too.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:11.800
It means I have a chance
to do something

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.366
duel fans will
never see coming!

00:04:13.366 --> 00:04:14.533
You mean...

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:17.066
beat Jack Atlas,
the Master of Faster,

00:04:17.066 --> 00:04:19.000
the one and only King?

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.766
Okay, maybe I wasn't
very clear before.

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:24.533
See, Jack doesn't just
have great cards,

00:04:24.533 --> 00:04:26.800
he has the best
strategies, too.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.900
To beat him you'll need
something special,

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:32.233
something that nobody else
seems to have.

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:34.600
Well, at least nobody
around here.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.033
Guess it's a good thing I'm
not from around here, then.

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:42.200
Well, I guess we'll find out
soon enough.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.700
'Cause your match is
about to start.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.800
Follow me.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.800
(Yugo)
Shake your tail feather, Zuzu!

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:50.900
We're gonna miss the start!

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.100
I'm hurrying!
Wait for me!

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.300
Sorry, Zuzu, but I just
can't help myself.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.566
I mean, check out
this stadium.

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:01.133
It's too cool!

00:05:01.133 --> 00:05:04.600
Can you believe we actually
get to duel here?

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.066
Somebody pinch me!

00:05:06.066 --> 00:05:08.266
Gotta admit,
you're right.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:10.133
It's even bigger
than I thought.

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:12.133
And there's not an
empty seat in the house.

00:05:12.133 --> 00:05:13.333
This is big time.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.200
And now,
to kick the party off

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:17.100
with the man everyone
wants to see.

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:18.566
<i>He needs no introduction,</i>

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:20.633
but I'll still read
what's on the
teleprompter!

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:23.300
Give it up for the Master of
Faster...

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.333
<i>Jack Atlas!</i>

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.933
Atlas! Atlas! Atlas!

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:29.533
Atlas! Atlas!

00:05:29.533 --> 00:05:31.933
Atlas! Atlas! Atlas!

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:33.733
Atlas! Atlas!

00:05:33.733 --> 00:05:36.500
Yeah! Jack! Jack!

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.800
(all)
We love you, Jack! Yay!

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.900
Yep, our hometown
hero is here

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:43.166
and ready to duel in an
exhibition match!

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:45.400
Which means we have someone
else to introduce as well.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.633
So without further ado,
here he is,

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.633
<i>Jack's challenger!</i>

00:05:49.633 --> 00:05:51.933
Huh?

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:53.433
Of course by
"challenger",

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:56.000
I don't actually mean that
Jackwill in any way be
challenged.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.533
It's really just a figure
of speech, but I digress.

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:03.533
<i>Here he is, Yuya Sakaki!</i>

00:06:15.978 --> 00:06:17.412
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>Enterin' stage left</i>

00:06:17.412 --> 00:06:19.145
is the dueltaining
challenger,

00:06:19.145 --> 00:06:20.512
<i>Yuya Sakaki!</i>

00:06:20.512 --> 00:06:22.145
Can it be?

00:06:25.712 --> 00:06:28.145
I can hardly control this thing
as it is.

00:06:28.145 --> 00:06:30.312
Should be real entertaining
trying to duel on it!

00:06:33.112 --> 00:06:34.545
Yuya.

00:06:34.545 --> 00:06:37.078
I can't believe it!

00:06:37.078 --> 00:06:39.612
(beeping)

00:06:39.612 --> 00:06:40.778
Your bracelet!

00:06:40.778 --> 00:06:43.812
it only goes off
when Yuya's around.

00:06:43.812 --> 00:06:47.645
That means
there's no doubt.

00:06:47.645 --> 00:06:48.945
It's Yuya.

00:06:48.945 --> 00:06:51.645
(Yugo)
That's Yuya?

00:06:53.412 --> 00:06:55.245
Since you said
he looked like me,

00:06:55.245 --> 00:06:57.778
I thought he'd be
a lot more handsome.

00:06:57.778 --> 00:07:00.212
But I feel sorry for him.

00:07:00.212 --> 00:07:02.312
He's bound for pound town.

00:07:02.312 --> 00:07:03.678
What's that mean?

00:07:03.678 --> 00:07:06.412
The same thing happens
every year.

00:07:06.412 --> 00:07:09.578
They pick some chump
for Jack to beat.

00:07:09.578 --> 00:07:11.712
It's the tournament's way

00:07:11.712 --> 00:07:14.778
of reminding everyone
how amazing he is.

00:07:14.778 --> 00:07:17.478
See, Jack doesn't take part
in the tournament,

00:07:17.478 --> 00:07:19.812
but he does face
whoever wins it.

00:07:19.812 --> 00:07:21.845
So having us watch this
smack‐down

00:07:21.845 --> 00:07:25.845
makes us even more intimidated
by Jack's duel skills.

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:27.912
He's always two steps ahead.

00:07:27.912 --> 00:07:29.878
He thinks of absolutely
everything,

00:07:29.878 --> 00:07:31.678
from his monsters
to his spells

00:07:31.678 --> 00:07:33.678
to the mental aspect
of the game.

00:07:33.678 --> 00:07:35.878
Sure he's known as
the "Master of Faster,"

00:07:35.878 --> 00:07:37.712
but truth is he's a master of

00:07:37.712 --> 00:07:40.812
every strategic element
there is to know in dueling.

00:07:40.812 --> 00:07:44.245
So your friend doesn't
stand a chance.

00:07:44.245 --> 00:07:46.345
Sorry, but you don't
know him.

00:07:46.345 --> 00:07:47.445
Wow.

00:07:47.445 --> 00:07:49.178
I'm sorry if I touched
a nerve there.

00:07:49.178 --> 00:07:51.145
Guess you really
believe in him.

00:07:51.145 --> 00:07:52.645
I do.

00:07:52.645 --> 00:07:56.245
Now then, what do you say we
quit talking about Jack
Atlas

00:07:56.245 --> 00:07:58.712
and bring him out for
all your fine folks

00:07:58.712 --> 00:08:00.412
<i>to feast your eyes on!</i>

00:08:00.412 --> 00:08:03.578
After all, how many more
words of praise

00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:05.812
could we possibly bestow
on the fella?

00:08:05.812 --> 00:08:07.712
Well, a few
more, actually!

00:08:07.712 --> 00:08:09.945
Here he is. The amazing,
the astonishing,

00:08:09.945 --> 00:08:14.678
the awesome and awe‐inspiring
Jack Atlas!

00:08:14.678 --> 00:08:17.045
(crowd cheering)

00:08:25.012 --> 00:08:27.445
(crowd cheering)

00:08:27.445 --> 00:08:29.512
Who's the Master of Faster?

00:08:29.512 --> 00:08:30.978
Who rules the duels?

00:08:30.978 --> 00:08:32.645
That's right, it's me!

00:08:32.645 --> 00:08:35.012
(girls)
We adore you, Jack Atlas!

00:08:42.345 --> 00:08:45.412
Did I mention that Jack puts on
a good show, too?

00:08:47.545 --> 00:08:49.345
Hello, my faithful!

00:08:49.345 --> 00:08:52.345
Tell Jack how you want me
todispose of this dueling
dud!

00:08:52.345 --> 00:08:53.345
Huh?

00:08:53.345 --> 00:08:55.478
Not too quick, Master!

00:08:55.478 --> 00:08:56.912
Let him last at least
three turns!

00:08:58.512 --> 00:08:59.745
So be it.

00:08:59.745 --> 00:09:02.045
Then this is how those
three turns will go

00:09:02.045 --> 00:09:04.045
for this unfortunate
underachiever.

00:09:04.045 --> 00:09:05.745
Not cool.

00:09:05.745 --> 00:09:07.978
Turn one!

00:09:07.978 --> 00:09:12.145
I'll make the first move and
set the stage for my victory!

00:09:12.145 --> 00:09:13.745
Turn two!

00:09:13.745 --> 00:09:17.078
I'll allow the amateur to make
some bad moves.

00:09:17.078 --> 00:09:18.245
Turn three!

00:09:18.245 --> 00:09:20.045
I will put him
out of his misery

00:09:20.045 --> 00:09:23.012
and emerge from this duel
victorious!

00:09:23.012 --> 00:09:25.378
Jack is prepared as always.

00:09:25.378 --> 00:09:27.612
That's just what we want,
is it not?

00:09:27.612 --> 00:09:29.345
Yes, it will
allow us to gauge

00:09:29.345 --> 00:09:31.512
how skilled these
Lancers really are.

00:09:31.512 --> 00:09:34.645
(Boldo)
I look forward to seeing what
they're capable of, Presider.

00:09:34.645 --> 00:09:36.045
(White)
Indeed.

00:09:36.045 --> 00:09:39.945
Let's see if their actions
live up to their words.

00:09:39.945 --> 00:09:42.412
Good luck, Yuya.

00:09:42.412 --> 00:09:46.478
(thinking) Jack Atlas says he
can beat me in three turns.

00:09:46.478 --> 00:09:50.312
Guess that means he doesn't
think very highly of me.

00:09:50.312 --> 00:09:53.412
That just makes me want to prove
him wrong even more!

00:09:53.412 --> 00:09:54.678
With the duel
about to start,

00:09:54.678 --> 00:09:56.412
it's time to activate
a field spell.

00:09:56.412 --> 00:09:58.245
But for this special
exhibition,

00:09:58.245 --> 00:10:00.812
they're gonna be dueling
on an Action Field!

00:10:00.812 --> 00:10:03.678
Huh?
What's an Action Field?

00:10:03.678 --> 00:10:06.045
Wait, for real?
Huh?

00:10:06.045 --> 00:10:08.312
We have granted your request.

00:10:08.312 --> 00:10:12.178
The use of Action Cards will
be permitted in this duel.

00:10:12.178 --> 00:10:13.312
(Declan)
Good.

00:10:13.312 --> 00:10:15.778
If you want to see what the
Lancers can do,

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:19.078
you must allow us to duel
how we duel best.

00:10:19.078 --> 00:10:21.645
(Boldo)
So you say. But now ther
e are no excuses.

00:10:21.645 --> 00:10:25.312
(Gale) Yes, if the Lancer loses,
it does not bode well.

00:10:25.312 --> 00:10:26.345
(Gray)
Agreed, Presider?

00:10:26.345 --> 00:10:29.278
Agreed.
(chuckles)

00:10:29.278 --> 00:10:31.978
(Melissa)
All right, let's get on
with the show!

00:10:31.978 --> 00:10:34.012
Today's Action Field is...

00:10:34.012 --> 00:10:35.712
Crossover...

00:10:35.712 --> 00:10:37.812
<i>Acceleration!</i>

00:10:37.812 --> 00:10:40.778
(computer voice)
Duel mode engaged,
autopilot activated.

00:10:45.312 --> 00:10:47.945
Now then, gentlemen,
rev those engines!

00:10:47.945 --> 00:10:50.945
On your mark.
Get set.

00:10:50.945 --> 00:10:53.312
Go!
(revving)

00:10:54.945 --> 00:10:56.312
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:10:57.412 --> 00:10:58.512
(thinking)
Cool!

00:10:58.512 --> 00:11:00.378
This Duel Runner has an
autopilot function

00:11:00.378 --> 00:11:03.212
so I can focus on dueling
instead of steering.

00:11:03.212 --> 00:11:04.945
New Domino City,
let me hear you!

00:11:04.945 --> 00:11:06.578
(cheering)

00:11:06.578 --> 00:11:07.978
<i>Excellent!</i>

00:11:07.978 --> 00:11:11.245
And now, time for Yuya to
feel the sting of defeat!

00:11:11.245 --> 00:11:12.545
Here goes!

00:11:12.545 --> 00:11:16.045
I'll set the pace of this duel
with Red Sprinter!

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:23.078
And since this is the only
monster on the field,

00:11:23.078 --> 00:11:25.412
I can summon one
Level 3‐or‐below

00:11:25.412 --> 00:11:27.878
Tuner Monster
from my hand.

00:11:27.878 --> 00:11:30.212
And I choose this one.

00:11:30.212 --> 00:11:31.345
Reveal yourself.

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:33.745
Red Resonator!

00:11:33.745 --> 00:11:35.612
And now for the fun part.

00:11:35.612 --> 00:11:39.445
Level 2 Red Resonator, tune with
Level 4 Red Sprinter!

00:11:39.445 --> 00:11:41.278
(manic laughter)

00:11:43.478 --> 00:11:46.112
Witness the power of this
ultimate pairing!

00:11:46.112 --> 00:11:48.412
Witness the power of my...

00:11:48.412 --> 00:11:49.878
Synchro Summon!

00:11:49.878 --> 00:11:53.278
Now rise, Red Wyvern!

00:11:55.945 --> 00:11:56.978
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>And true to his name,</i>

00:11:56.978 --> 00:11:58.778
the Master of Faster
brings out

00:11:58.778 --> 00:12:02.512
an incredibly powerful
monster incredibly fast!

00:12:02.512 --> 00:12:06.845
And it would seem Yuya is in
incredibly big trouble!

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:19.567
Oh, yeah!

00:12:19.567 --> 00:12:21.767
Go Jack!
All right!

00:12:21.767 --> 00:12:25.534
Sorry Zuzu, I know Yuya is your
friend, but I can't help it!

00:12:25.534 --> 00:12:27.200
Jack is just too amazing!

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.634
I'm with you, Jack!

00:12:28.634 --> 00:12:31.767
I'll now place one facedown
and end my turn.

00:12:36.234 --> 00:12:39.467
Rumor has it you call yourself
a dueltainer, Yuya.

00:12:39.467 --> 00:12:42.800
Well, then by all means,
go ahead and entertain me.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.034
That won't be a problem at
all, Jack, 'cause it's
showtime!

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:49.200
First I'm setting
the Pendulum Scale

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.767
with Scale 1 Stargazer
Magician,

00:12:51.767 --> 00:12:53.867
and Scale 8
Timegazer Magician!

00:12:53.867 --> 00:12:57.434
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:05.700
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:07.200
all at the same time!

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.100
Swing far, pendulum!

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:13.134
Carve the arc of victory!

00:13:13.134 --> 00:13:15.434
My monsters are ready...

00:13:15.434 --> 00:13:18.300
to swing into action!

00:13:20.034 --> 00:13:24.834
Hocus pocus to it, Performapal
Trump Girl!

00:13:24.834 --> 00:13:27.667
H‐2‐go, Performapal Skeeter
Skimmer!

00:13:27.667 --> 00:13:30.400
Stamp to it, Performapal
Stamp Turtle!

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.000
But like any great showman,
I've saved the best for last.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:36.767
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:13:36.767 --> 00:13:38.534
(roaring)

00:13:38.534 --> 00:13:41.800
(Melissa)
<i>Four monsters at once?</i>

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:43.634
What a whopping
first move!

00:13:43.634 --> 00:13:46.300
And it appears that y'all in
attendance are wondering,

00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:47.434
<i>what the hey?</i>

00:13:47.434 --> 00:13:48.534
<i>Can't blame you.</i>

00:13:48.534 --> 00:13:50.134
This is some
never‐before‐seen summoning!

00:13:50.134 --> 00:13:52.800
Can it be that Yuya has what it
takes to win this duel?

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:56.034
That the Master of Faster is
being masterfully outshined?

00:13:56.034 --> 00:13:59.034
That Yuya really is the
dueltainer he says he is?

00:13:59.034 --> 00:14:00.200
Keep it up, Yuya!

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:02.267
Show everyone
just what you can do!

00:14:02.267 --> 00:14:04.734
And now, thanks to
Performapal Trump Girl,

00:14:04.734 --> 00:14:08.134
I'm allowed to use a Pendulum
Monster to Fusion Summon!

00:14:08.134 --> 00:14:10.267
It's time to merge your might!

00:14:10.267 --> 00:14:14.500
I fuse Performapal Trump Girl
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.700
Now with a dash of cosmic
chemistry,

00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:19.767
I can create an even
mightier monster!

00:14:21.967 --> 00:14:23.400
Taking center stage,

00:14:23.400 --> 00:14:25.867
the one, the only...

00:14:25.867 --> 00:14:28.767
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:14:31.334 --> 00:14:33.067
(roaring)

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:36.800
But Rune Eyes will have to share
this stage,

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:40.967
because next I overlay Stamp
Turtle and Skeeter Skimmer!

00:14:44.300 --> 00:14:47.700
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:51.634
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons!

00:14:51.634 --> 00:14:53.767
I Xyz Summon!

00:14:53.767 --> 00:14:57.800
Rank 4 Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon!

00:15:00.834 --> 00:15:02.634
Didn't that belong to...

00:15:02.634 --> 00:15:05.600
Yeah, it sure did.
That was Yuto's Dragon.

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.467
Three new summoning methods?

00:15:07.467 --> 00:15:10.634
This is something my eyes
have never seen before.

00:15:10.634 --> 00:15:13.700
It seems these Lancers
truly do have power.

00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:16.467
The boy is quite impressive,
is he not?

00:15:16.467 --> 00:15:18.000
Mm‐hmm.

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.567
Oh, yes, he is quite
entertaining.

00:15:20.567 --> 00:15:23.600
(Melissa)
Well, partners and
partnerettes,

00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:26.034
I think it safe to say that
none of us saw these

00:15:26.034 --> 00:15:28.700
dynamite dueltaining moves
coming from Yuya!

00:15:28.700 --> 00:15:30.500
But that's not to say someone
else didn't,

00:15:30.500 --> 00:15:33.767
and that someone is
Jack Atlas!

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:35.367
Time to see if
the Master of Faster

00:15:35.367 --> 00:15:37.434
can be fast enough on
his feet to take down

00:15:37.434 --> 00:15:40.534
these new threats before they
take him down!

00:15:40.534 --> 00:15:43.300
Nice moves, Yuya,
but not nice enough!

00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:45.034
Since you now have
two monsters out

00:15:45.034 --> 00:15:46.900
with more attack points
than Red Wyvern,

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.534
then I'm permitted to destroy
one of them.

00:15:49.534 --> 00:15:51.600
The strongest one,
as a matter of fact!

00:15:53.734 --> 00:15:59.034
So say farewell to your
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:59.034 --> 00:16:00.700
Don't think so!

00:16:01.934 --> 00:16:03.467
Nice!

00:16:05.534 --> 00:16:09.967
I activate the Action Spell
Mirror Barrier!

00:16:09.967 --> 00:16:12.534
So now Rune‐Eyes is
safe and sound!

00:16:12.534 --> 00:16:13.567
Hot dawg!

00:16:13.567 --> 00:16:16.100
Did y'all just see that?
Crazy!

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.400
(girls)
Poor Jack, that isn't fair!

00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:19.467
Get on track, Jack.

00:16:19.467 --> 00:16:20.734
Poor Jacky‐poo.

00:16:20.734 --> 00:16:23.467
I say, these Action Cards
change everything!

00:16:23.467 --> 00:16:25.067
Such a thrill.

00:16:25.067 --> 00:16:27.734
You know what?
I didn't think it was possible,

00:16:27.734 --> 00:16:30.134
but Turbo Duelin' just got
nitro'd!

00:16:30.134 --> 00:16:31.367
For real!

00:16:31.367 --> 00:16:34.367
You said you'd beat me
in three turns.

00:16:34.367 --> 00:16:36.767
So guess I gotta beat you...

00:16:36.767 --> 00:16:37.900
in two!

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:40.834
And with Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon...

00:16:40.834 --> 00:16:44.634
that's exactly what I'll do!

00:16:44.634 --> 00:16:47.467
I'm using two of
its Overlay Units.

00:16:47.467 --> 00:16:51.200
Each Overlay Unit cuts your Red
Wyvern's attack points in
half,

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:55.334
and Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
gains those attack points.

00:16:57.900 --> 00:16:59.334
(roaring)

00:17:01.834 --> 00:17:04.334
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Yuya's Dragon just
lasso'd itself

00:17:04.334 --> 00:17:05.900
<i>a heap of attack points!</i>

00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.234
Is the Master of Faster headed
straight for disaster?

00:17:12.300 --> 00:17:13.500
Here goes!

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:15.467
Dark Rebellion!

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:18.100
Attack Jack's Red Wyvern!

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.200
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:17:27.434 --> 00:17:29.534
(Melissa)
<i>Oh! And just like that,</i>

00:17:29.534 --> 00:17:33.300
Jack is down to a paltry
300 life points!

00:17:33.300 --> 00:17:35.767
Now to drop 'em to zero!

00:17:35.767 --> 00:17:38.467
Go, Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:38.467 --> 00:17:41.167
Attack Jack Atlas directly!

00:17:41.167 --> 00:17:42.434
Good grief!

00:17:42.434 --> 00:17:44.400
Seems like the Master's
finally met his match!

00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:46.534
(girls)
Oh, no! We can't look!

00:17:48.800 --> 00:17:51.934
Spiral Skyshot!

00:18:05.586 --> 00:18:07.886
Spiral Skyshot!

00:18:25.420 --> 00:18:27.686
Surprised?
Well, I'm not!

00:18:27.686 --> 00:18:31.286
Because I got the hang of Action
Duels quicker than you expected!

00:18:31.286 --> 00:18:33.386
With the Action Spell
Evasive Evasion,

00:18:33.386 --> 00:18:35.386
I not only got to
summon a Token,

00:18:35.386 --> 00:18:37.086
but I also got to
stop your attack!

00:18:37.086 --> 00:18:40.220
Seems you're not the only man
of action around here, Yuya!

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.486
(man)
Incredible!

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.886
Nice.

00:18:48.886 --> 00:18:51.586
But since I used Trump Girl
to Fusion Summon Rune‐Eyes,

00:18:51.586 --> 00:18:53.420
Rune‐Eyes gets
to attack twice!

00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:55.786
Rune‐Eyes, attack his Token!

00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:58.520
I activate the trap
Reject Reborn!

00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:01.786
It slams the brakes on your
monster's attack!

00:19:05.686 --> 00:19:09.353
Reject Reborn also
destroys my Token.

00:19:09.353 --> 00:19:12.720
But I get to bring back two
monsters from my graveyard!

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:14.720
And that's too bad for you!

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:15.953
That's not good!

00:19:15.953 --> 00:19:18.720
(Jack, on P. A.)
<i>Not for you it's not!</i>

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:20.520
I blocked two attacks,

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:23.920
so rise again, Red Wyvern
and Red Resonator!

00:19:25.620 --> 00:19:28.420
And thanks to Red Resonator's
special ability,

00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:30.486
I now regain life points equal

00:19:30.486 --> 00:19:32.953
to my Red Wyvern's attack
points!

00:19:32.953 --> 00:19:37.486
Red Wyvern has 2,400, so I
regain 2,400 life points!

00:19:37.486 --> 00:19:40.620
Oh, my! Not only did Jack
sidestep Yuya's attack,

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.820
but he was able to bring back
two of his monsters

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:45.586
and nearly all the life points
he lost before!

00:19:45.586 --> 00:19:48.920
Jack Atlas ain't just in
topfighting form right now,

00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:51.920
he appears to
bebetter than ever!

00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:53.886
(cheering)

00:19:56.453 --> 00:19:58.453
(girls)
We love you, Jack!

00:20:00.353 --> 00:20:03.120
Almost had him!
I end my turn!

00:20:03.120 --> 00:20:08.520
And Dark Rebllion Xyz Dragon's
attack points return to normal.

00:20:08.520 --> 00:20:10.286
Jack sure did show him!

00:20:10.286 --> 00:20:11.386
All right!

00:20:11.386 --> 00:20:12.986
Yuya.

00:20:12.986 --> 00:20:14.920
Listen up, Yuya.

00:20:14.920 --> 00:20:16.986
You call yourself
a duelatiner.

00:20:16.986 --> 00:20:18.220
Well, here's my review.

00:20:18.220 --> 00:20:20.753
Your performance was abysmal,
mediocre at best.

00:20:22.386 --> 00:20:24.920
And I'm gonna bring
the curtain down on you!

00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:26.220
(growls)

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.720
I promised I would beat you
on the third turn,

00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.253
and I'm a man of my word!

00:20:30.253 --> 00:20:31.686
(revving)

00:20:35.086 --> 00:20:36.653
My draw!

00:20:36.653 --> 00:20:38.253
And my first order of business

00:20:38.253 --> 00:20:40.653
will be to tune
Level 2 Red Resonator

00:20:40.653 --> 00:20:42.386
with Level 6 Red Wyvern!

00:20:47.286 --> 00:20:49.786
Now from the ancient chasms
of a lost world,

00:20:49.786 --> 00:20:54.153
I awake a great and terrible
power!

00:20:54.153 --> 00:20:56.353
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:56.353 --> 00:21:00.253
Now rise, Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:02.720
(roaring)

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:05.086
And with its arrival will
come your end,

00:21:05.086 --> 00:21:07.820
because thanks to Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:10.053
I can destroy
all your monsters

00:21:10.053 --> 00:21:12.620
and then you take 500 points
of damage

00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:15.186
for each one that perished
by its flames!

00:21:15.186 --> 00:21:18.853
Feel the heat, Yuya, of your
impending demise!

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.153
And now, Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend,

00:21:29.153 --> 00:21:32.020
attack Yuya directly,
then end this!

00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:35.353
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:21:35.353 --> 00:21:37.453
Now get out of my arena!

00:21:39.286 --> 00:21:41.920
Aah!

00:21:45.053 --> 00:21:46.620
