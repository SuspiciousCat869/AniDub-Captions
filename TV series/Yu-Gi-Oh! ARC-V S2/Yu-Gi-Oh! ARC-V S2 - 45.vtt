WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.000
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.966
Unite and fight!

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:07.433
Unite and fight!

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:10.433
So Sergey the psycho
swiped Zuzu?

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:13.800
And Celina was taken back
to the Fusion Dimension?

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.033
Roget...

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:16.666
He wants to rule this City.

00:00:16.666 --> 00:00:19.033
And he's gonna use Zuzu to make
sure Duel Academy

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:20.766
doesn't get in
the way of that.

00:00:20.766 --> 00:00:22.766
I'm busting her out!

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.400
Wait up!
Ugh!

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.500
Buddy.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.933
The Friendship Cup will
continue...

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:33.000
with a special guest competitor.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.100
Welcome, Zuzu.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.333
You're just in time to see the
next duel get underway.

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:44.533
Jack Atlas is the hope for the
Commons and the Topsiders alike,

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:47.866
but when Sergey defeats Jack,
their hero will fall.

00:00:47.866 --> 00:00:50.766
They will be looking for a new
leader to guide them.

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:51.866
Me!

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.466
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.266
Initiate Turbo Thruster Mode.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.866
It's transformation time.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.466
Aagghh!

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:14.633
I've transformed him into the
first Biocybernetic Duelist.

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:16.400
Biocybernetic?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.033
If you believe you can
dethrone me,

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:20.800
you're just spinning your
wheels!

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.433
Before this day ends,

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:25.000
all of New Domino City will
be bowing before me.

Engaging Action Card damage
parameters!

00:02:45.366 --> 00:02:48.066
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Uh‐oh!
Jack better watch out!

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:49.266
And now,

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:52.600
Earthbound Tundra's effect
activates!

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.700
By banishing my Action Card,
you take 300 points of damage,

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.933
and your monster loses
300 attack points.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.266
(Melissa)
<i>Not again!</i>

00:03:04.266 --> 00:03:06.566
Sergey's going on an
Action Card rampage!

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:10.166
And it looks like all
Jack's can do is sit back and
take it!

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.366
I must ensure Jack cannot pass
me to retrieve Action Cards...

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.500
before me!

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:19.033
(Melissa)
Sergey's tearing up the
terrain!

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:20.900
Now this course has
more holes in it

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.166
then a prairie full of
groundhogs!

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:26.233
He's trying to knock Jack
out of the race!

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:28.100
Fight fair, you psycho!

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.233
C'mon, Jack!
Crush that creep!

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:32.600
Right now he'll be
lucky to survive.

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.666
(beeping)

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:41.133
(Melissa)
I spy another Action Card
just up ahead!

00:03:41.133 --> 00:03:43.566
It seems like Jack can't
catch a break!

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.566
<i>Jumpin' jackrabbits!</i>

00:03:48.566 --> 00:03:52.366
The Master of Faster is gonna
leapfrog over Sergey!

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.366
Must not let Jack pass me!

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.166
(Melissa)
<i>Aw, fiddlesticks!</i>

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.700
Swatted out of the air
like he was a measly fly!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.600
And to add injury to insult,
Sergey weakens Jack again!

00:04:07.233 --> 00:04:10.333
I don't think Jack can muscle
his way out of this one!

00:04:10.333 --> 00:04:12.833
That maniac has Jack
pinned back.

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:16.833
He's not gonna last much
longer if Sergey keeps up the
crazy.

00:04:16.833 --> 00:04:19.766
What a letdown.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.100
(sinister chuckle)

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:28.366
So sorry to rain on
your parade, people.

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:31.766
I'm afraid the Master of Faster
is all washed up.

00:04:31.766 --> 00:04:32.633
(sinister chuckle)

00:04:34.533 --> 00:04:38.100
I banish another Action Card to
deal you damage

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:40.266
and weaken your monster.

00:04:40.266 --> 00:04:45.766
Next, I activate the spell card
Earthbound Rescue!

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:48.866
By retrieving Earthbound
Stone Sweeper,

00:04:48.866 --> 00:04:51.033
I can summon it back
to the field.

00:04:51.033 --> 00:04:53.466
Next optimal move is to summon

00:04:53.466 --> 00:04:57.033
the Tuner Monster Earthbound
Prisoner Ground Keeper!

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:02.500
I activate the spell Harmonic
Synchro Fusion

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.100
and I can use two monsters
on my field,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.700
to Synchro Summon and Fusion
Summon!

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:13.333
I'm not losing to some maniac
on a moped. You are going down!

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.633
Initiating Synchro Summon

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:18.900
to tune Level 1 Earthbound
Prisoner Ground Keeper

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.133
with Level 5 Earthbound Prisoner
Stone Sweeper.

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:27.633
I Synchro Summon!

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:32.000
Earthbound Servant Geo Gremlin!

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.766
(roaring)

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.600
I will now initiating secondary
action in protocol!

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.833
These two Earthbound Prisoners
assimilate into one!

00:05:45.366 --> 00:05:47.366
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:47.366 --> 00:05:50.333
Earthbound Servant Geo Gremlina!

00:05:50.333 --> 00:05:52.200
(roaring)

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:57.733
Initiating victory protocol
alpha.

00:05:57.733 --> 00:05:59.700
Alpha?

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:04.300
I activate Geo Gremlin's
special ability.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.866
You must choose whether
to destroy

00:06:06.866 --> 00:06:10.966
or not destroy your Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:14.433
If you destroy
your Archfiend,

00:06:14.433 --> 00:06:16.500
there will be no battle
this turn,

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.100
and you will postpone defeat
by one turn.

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.466
If you do not destroy your
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:24.800
then I will gain life points

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:27.000
equal to your monster's
attack points!

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.433
(roaring)

00:06:29.433 --> 00:06:31.100
But that will be irrelevant,

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.433
because my monsters can attack

00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:37.033
and deplete the rest of your
life points.

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:39.966
Now... make choice!

00:06:39.966 --> 00:06:42.866
Jack only has one choice.

00:06:42.866 --> 00:06:46.133
Jack must choose to
destroy his Dragon.

00:06:46.133 --> 00:06:48.700
It's his one and only hope
of survival.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.233
But he doesn't know that that
won't help him either.

00:06:52.233 --> 00:06:53.400
Why?

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.666
Because Gremlina's special
ability will kick in

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:58.533
the instant that Jack
eliminates Archfiend.

00:06:58.533 --> 00:07:00.400
I assume that isn't
a good thing.

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.833
Correct, my dear.

00:07:02.833 --> 00:07:07.133
Gremlina's special ability will
destroy all of Sergey's monsters

00:07:07.133 --> 00:07:11.700
and deal damage equal to their
total attack points to Jack.

00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:12.966
(gasps)

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:15.066
Between them,
the two Gremlin monsters

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:17.100
have four thousand
attack points.

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:22.600
But Jack only has 2,500 life
points, so he will lose.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:29.466
And now, choice must be
selected.

00:07:29.466 --> 00:07:31.266
I don't like the options.

00:07:31.266 --> 00:07:33.466
Optimal choice,
destroy Dragon.

00:07:33.466 --> 00:07:34.533
No chance.

00:07:34.533 --> 00:07:36.066
My Dragon is part of me,

00:07:36.066 --> 00:07:38.966
and I won't just throw it away
like it's garbage.

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:40.666
Destroy Dragon!

00:07:40.666 --> 00:07:43.066
Archfiend and I
have a special bond!

00:07:43.066 --> 00:07:44.800
We know that we can
count on each other,

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:46.333
even when things look hopeless

00:07:46.333 --> 00:07:47.666
and our backs are
up against the wall.

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:50.366
I would never betray it
to save myself!

00:07:50.366 --> 00:07:53.033
Does not... compute.

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:54.700
What is happening?

00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:56.600
(roaring)

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:58.600
(Melissa) Jack won't
ditch his Dragon,

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:01.766
so Sergey gets bucked up by
1,500 life points!

00:08:01.766 --> 00:08:05.233
Protocol alpha alternative
initialized.

00:08:05.233 --> 00:08:11.066
Geo Gremlin, annihilate
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:08:11.066 --> 00:08:14.400
Once Archfiend bites the dust,
Jack sheds 500 life points!

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:17.500
And I'm sure as shooting that
after this attack,

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.566
Geo Gremlina will
make a beeline

00:08:19.566 --> 00:08:22.800
straight at Jack to strike
the K. O. blow!

00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.566
Jack Atlas' reign has
finally come to an end!

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:29.766
And then I will rule this
City as its true King.

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:31.800
Chance of victory...

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.166
100%!

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:34.933
(roaring)

00:08:38.466 --> 00:08:41.766
I'm activating
the trap Red Gem!

00:08:41.766 --> 00:08:45.600
This saves my Archfiend from
destruction this turn.

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.066
But your life points
are not protected.

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:55.300
Geo Gremlina, attack Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:58.766
(roaring)

00:08:58.766 --> 00:09:01.766
With Red Gem protecting it,
you're spinning your wheels!

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:06.000
Foolish. Saving your Dragon
is not optimal move.

00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.733
I told you.

00:09:07.733 --> 00:09:09.633
Archfiend's never let me down,

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:11.833
and I won't ditch it when it
looks like I'm running on
empty.

00:09:11.833 --> 00:09:14.666
We're bound by
the same spirit!

00:09:14.666 --> 00:09:16.200
Aagghh!

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.033
Dueling fires us up!

00:09:18.033 --> 00:09:21.366
The tougher the competition
gets, the hotter we burn!

00:09:21.366 --> 00:09:23.466
Archfiend and I have a single
purpose,

00:09:23.466 --> 00:09:26.266
to battle with blazing glory
for all to see

00:09:26.266 --> 00:09:28.166
'til we shine like the sun!

00:09:28.166 --> 00:09:32.433
The Master of Faster and his
Dragon, ruling together!

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:36.900
Does not compute.

00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.866
<i>Does not compute!</i>

00:09:38.866 --> 00:09:40.266
Now what?

00:09:40.266 --> 00:09:43.900
(groaning)

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.933
(rapid beeping)

00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:49.533
I end my turn.

00:09:49.533 --> 00:09:51.633
And I'll take over!

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.466
Give up!

00:09:54.466 --> 00:09:57.033
Odds of victory 100%.

00:09:57.033 --> 00:09:59.600
My new body's too speedy
for you!

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.866
You move like slug,

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:04.300
while Sergey bolts down track as
quick as lightning!

00:10:05.666 --> 00:10:07.100
Talk is cheap.

00:10:07.100 --> 00:10:10.266
(rapid beeping)

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:13.266
I count seven Action Cards
on track ahead of us.

00:10:13.266 --> 00:10:16.800
And I... will capture
all of them!

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.733
(rapid beeping)

00:10:19.733 --> 00:10:22.833
His emotions are overloading
my programming!

00:10:24.933 --> 00:10:27.000
(Melissa) Jack's
really pouring it on!

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.200
He's pulled within striking
distance of Sergey!

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.933
You're not gonna shake me
that easily, pal.

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:34.900
All right.

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:38.366
Then you are in for bumpy ride!

00:10:38.366 --> 00:10:41.833
I relish a good
obstacle course.

00:10:41.833 --> 00:10:45.200
Only one of us can rule this
track... and that's me!

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:49.066
(Melissa)
Jack seems to be closing in
using pure willpower!

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:52.366
'Course, riding inside
your opponent's slipstream
helps, too!

00:10:52.366 --> 00:10:53.833
(sinister chuckle)

00:10:53.833 --> 00:10:56.033
You are still right where
you should be...

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:57.200
stuck behind me!

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.333
When the time is right,
I'll see the light.

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:01.966
What light?

00:11:01.966 --> 00:11:04.600
I hardly ever fall behind,
but when I do,

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.433
I count on my intuition lighting
up the way ahead.

00:11:07.433 --> 00:11:10.033
It'll show me the path to
victory!

00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:16.533
(Melissa)
Now, that's the Jack Atlas
we all know and admire!

00:11:16.533 --> 00:11:19.533
Why, he's as full of fight
as a barrel of testy
scorpions!

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:21.500
They cooled off.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.166
Because of Jack.

00:11:26.066 --> 00:11:28.200
(Melissa)
There's an Action Card
dead ahead!

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.066
And it will be mine!

00:11:30.066 --> 00:11:31.033
Uhh!

00:11:47.333 --> 00:11:49.100
No way!

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:51.900
(Melissa)If I hadn't seen that
move with my own pair of
peepers,

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.666
I wouldn't have
believed it!

00:11:53.666 --> 00:11:55.333
Due to Earthbound Tundra,

00:11:55.333 --> 00:11:58.700
only one of us is allowed to
have Action Cards.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.966
So I have to get rid of mine.

00:12:00.966 --> 00:12:02.966
So that means you can't
keep using

00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:05.466
Earthbound Tundra's effect to
drain my life points away!

00:12:05.466 --> 00:12:07.600
(Melissa)
Once again, the Master of
Faster's

00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.166
<i>always ahead of the pack!</i>

00:12:09.166 --> 00:12:11.566
Now he can kick things into
overdrive!

00:12:11.566 --> 00:12:15.466
Jack's scooting straight
for the next Action Card
on the track!

00:12:15.466 --> 00:12:17.133
It's still there?

00:12:17.133 --> 00:12:19.400
But that little card was ripe
for the pickin'!

00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.033
<i>What's Jack up to?</i>

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:22.300
Shall I show you?

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:24.200
I'm gonna win this my way!

00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:27.166
(groaning)

00:12:27.166 --> 00:12:29.000
What a fool.

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.066
Now Sergey can pick up
that Action Card

00:12:31.066 --> 00:12:34.633
and keep dealing you damage like
before, Mr. Master of Nothing!

00:12:34.633 --> 00:12:38.266
(Melissa)
That card has Sergey's name
written all over‐‐ Huh?

00:12:38.266 --> 00:12:39.333
(rapid beeping)

00:12:39.333 --> 00:12:41.300
He's short‐circuiting!

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:46.100
Jack Atlas, let's go!

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:49.733
I don't need an Action Card
to crush runt like you!

00:12:49.733 --> 00:12:52.133
Instead of letting the field
decide the outcome,

00:12:52.133 --> 00:12:54.766
the best duelist will win.

00:12:54.766 --> 00:12:56.466
(people murmuring)

00:12:56.466 --> 00:12:58.666
(crowd cheering)

00:12:58.666 --> 00:13:00.833
I'm ending my turn.

00:13:00.833 --> 00:13:02.133
Your move, Sergey!

00:13:02.133 --> 00:13:04.400
I will break you!

00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:05.933
Now attack!

00:13:05.933 --> 00:13:07.766
Geo Gremlin, crush Archfiend!

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:09.766
Now!
(roaring)

00:13:09.766 --> 00:13:12.800
I activate the Action Spell
Tenacity!

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.166
When I'm down to one Monster
on my field,

00:13:15.166 --> 00:13:18.666
this Action Spell will shield
it from being destroyed!

00:13:18.666 --> 00:13:20.800
But you can't avoid taking
damage!

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:26.333
Geo Gremlina, show no mercy!

00:13:26.333 --> 00:13:27.900
Go!

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:29.433
(roaring)

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:32.466
(Jack)
Tenacity saves my Dragon again!

00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:35.200
(Melissa)
Jack's done a great job of
protecting Archfiend,

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.166
but he can't do diddly to
protect himself!

00:13:38.166 --> 00:13:40.833
Very good!
Keep up the pressure!

00:13:40.833 --> 00:13:42.466
Crush the hopes and dreams

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:45.366
of each and every individual
living in this city!

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:48.000
New Domino will be paralyzed
with despair,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.066
and I'll move in
to save the day!

00:13:50.066 --> 00:13:53.233
In a short time, the people of
New Domino City

00:13:53.233 --> 00:13:56.366
will have a new hero
to look up to.

00:13:56.366 --> 00:13:59.300
I activate the spell
Earthbound Fusion!

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.900
It lets me Fusion Summon.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:06.700
I fuse Geo Gremlin
and Geo Gremlina!

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:10.333
I bring a monster
to destroy you!

00:14:10.333 --> 00:14:13.300
Rising up from molten depths of
this world.

00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:15.833
His volcanic temper is
legendary!

00:14:15.833 --> 00:14:19.000
As are his infernal deeds
on the battlefield!

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.066
I Fusion Summon!

00:14:21.066 --> 00:14:22.466
Emerge...

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:27.166
Earthbound Servant Geo Grasha!

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.600
I can handle that clown.

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:31.033
Enough!

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:34.800
When Geo Garshna attacks your
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:38.300
your Dragon's attack points
become zero!

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.700
Your Action Spell was able to
save Archfiend,

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:50.200
but it cannot save you!

00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:54.266
Jack Atlas, you are finished!

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:00.866
Jack Atlas, you are finished!

00:15:00.866 --> 00:15:03.133
(Melissa)Jack better pull
another rabbit out of his
helmet!

00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:05.766
I discard Red Mirror,
from my hand!

00:15:05.766 --> 00:15:08.166
This is no
ordinary looking glass!

00:15:08.166 --> 00:15:10.566
When your Monster attacks,
Red Mirror lets me add

00:15:10.566 --> 00:15:13.066
a Red Monster to my hand
from the graveyard.

00:15:13.066 --> 00:15:16.733
Next, I discard Red Warg
and Dark Resonator

00:15:16.733 --> 00:15:19.700
to activate the trap card
Red Soul.

00:15:19.700 --> 00:15:23.033
It not only prevents Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend

00:15:23.033 --> 00:15:24.466
from being destroyed,

00:15:24.466 --> 00:15:27.266
but it reduces the amount
of damage I take.

00:15:27.266 --> 00:15:29.100
You're almost through!

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.966
(Melissa)Jack found out a way
to survive Sergey's onslaught,

00:15:31.966 --> 00:15:34.500
but the Master of Faster is
hanging on by a thread!

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:38.066
He's down to few piddling
life points, only 200!

00:15:41.466 --> 00:15:43.266
Looks like Sergey's
road wrecking

00:15:43.266 --> 00:15:45.800
has caused the track to reach
the breaking point!

00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:47.233
(groaning)

00:15:47.233 --> 00:15:48.633
<i>He's not gonna make it!</i>

00:15:48.633 --> 00:15:49.666
Uhh!

00:15:49.666 --> 00:15:52.000
Whoa!
Jack used his Dragon

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.300
to pull off a
heart‐thumpin' midair
rescue!

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.966
This duel's gonna be decided
on the track.

00:15:56.966 --> 00:15:59.300
That's how I roll, Sergey!

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.133
Does not compute!

00:16:01.133 --> 00:16:02.600
Jack is enemy!

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:04.766
Enemy should not help enemy!

00:16:04.766 --> 00:16:07.233
System overload!

00:16:07.233 --> 00:16:11.066
(sighs)
I'm free.

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:21.733
It's moments like this that
make Gong proud to be a duelist.

00:16:21.733 --> 00:16:23.400
Unreal!
Huh?

00:16:23.400 --> 00:16:25.333
You rock and rule, Jack!

00:16:25.333 --> 00:16:27.533
We believe in you
and we always will!

00:16:27.533 --> 00:16:29.833
Jack, you are the tops!

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:31.433
Best duelist ever!

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:34.100
(Melissa)
That was an impressive save
all right,

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:36.966
but Jack is still weak and
now he's pullin' up the
rear!

00:16:36.966 --> 00:16:38.333
He better giddy‐up quick,
folks,

00:16:38.333 --> 00:16:41.000
'cause there's an
Action Card straight ahead!

00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:43.500
Do not miss this chance, Sergey!

00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:45.633
Use that card to take
Atlas down!

00:16:45.633 --> 00:16:48.700
(Melissa)
That card has Sergey's name
written all over it!

00:16:49.966 --> 00:16:51.933
Sergey!

00:16:51.933 --> 00:16:54.533
And now...

00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:58.233
Atlas, prepare for the fight
of your life!

00:16:58.233 --> 00:17:02.866
Do not hold back and come at me
with everything in you arsenal!

00:17:02.866 --> 00:17:04.600
I'm in!

00:17:04.600 --> 00:17:07.233
Get back to the plan, Sergey!

00:17:07.233 --> 00:17:09.500
It's too late, Roget.

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:11.366
You failed.

00:17:11.366 --> 00:17:13.600
Pick up the next Action Card
on the track!

00:17:13.600 --> 00:17:14.966
Do it or else!

00:17:14.966 --> 00:17:17.200
Sergey isn't your puppet
anymore.

00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.066
He and Jack are going to
finish this duel their way.

00:17:22.133 --> 00:17:23.666
Jack!

00:17:23.666 --> 00:17:26.233
Show me why you are Master!

00:17:26.233 --> 00:17:30.666
All right, Sergey, let's push
this duel into overdrive!

00:17:30.666 --> 00:17:32.300
I'm gonna light it up,

00:17:32.300 --> 00:17:35.066
to give this city something
to cheer about!

00:17:35.066 --> 00:17:37.600
Ready, set...

00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.461
Draw!

00:17:43.529 --> 00:17:45.463
Ready, set...

00:17:45.463 --> 00:17:47.929
Draw!

00:17:49.663 --> 00:17:52.963
Excellent! The card I need
to fuel my victory!

00:17:52.963 --> 00:17:56.596
I'm now going to activate
the equip spell Soul Fist!

00:17:58.663 --> 00:18:02.196
I equip it onto Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend.

00:18:04.729 --> 00:18:06.729
So now your monster's
attack points

00:18:06.729 --> 00:18:09.763
become the same as Scarlet
Red Dragon Arhfiend's,

00:18:09.763 --> 00:18:13.763
so your monster's no longer
stronger than mine!

00:18:13.763 --> 00:18:15.996
(Melissa)
Well, pick my jaw off
the floor!

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:18.929
Sergey zeroed out Archfiend's
attack points before,

00:18:18.929 --> 00:18:20.896
but Jack boomeranged it
back at him,

00:18:20.896 --> 00:18:22.896
so Grashna has zero points
now, too!

00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:25.496
I activate Archfiend's
special ability!

00:18:25.496 --> 00:18:27.663
It allows me to destroy
all your monsters,

00:18:27.663 --> 00:18:30.196
then you take 500 points of
damage for each one

00:18:30.196 --> 00:18:32.096
that perished by its flames!

00:18:32.096 --> 00:18:34.563
Prepare to feel the heat!

00:18:41.029 --> 00:18:43.196
(roaring)

00:18:43.196 --> 00:18:45.663
(manic laughing)

00:18:45.663 --> 00:18:47.696
And now that you're your
Grashna is no more,

00:18:47.696 --> 00:18:49.963
Soul Fist's other effect
activates!

00:18:49.963 --> 00:18:52.663
So Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's attack points

00:18:52.663 --> 00:18:55.996
become the same as Grashna's
original attack points!

00:19:05.829 --> 00:19:08.296
Great, Jack!

00:19:08.296 --> 00:19:10.329
Master of Faster!

00:19:10.329 --> 00:19:12.229
Sultan of Speed!

00:19:12.229 --> 00:19:14.396
Our city's ace racer!

00:19:14.396 --> 00:19:15.729
And champion!

00:19:15.729 --> 00:19:18.096
(cheering)

00:19:21.963 --> 00:19:23.029
You ready?

00:19:23.029 --> 00:19:25.496
I am always ready!

00:19:25.496 --> 00:19:29.329
Bring the pain and let me feel
the power of your Dragon!

00:19:29.329 --> 00:19:32.396
All right, if that's
what you want.

00:19:32.396 --> 00:19:34.063
Now go, Archfiend!

00:19:34.063 --> 00:19:37.563
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:19:38.729 --> 00:19:40.096
Aah!

00:19:46.829 --> 00:19:48.196
Grab him, Archfiend!

00:19:50.596 --> 00:19:52.063
No!

00:19:52.063 --> 00:19:55.063
I once again control
my own fate, Jack!

00:19:55.063 --> 00:19:58.463
Farewell... for now!

00:19:58.463 --> 00:20:01.729
Until next time!

00:20:01.729 --> 00:20:03.463
Ha ha ha ha!

00:20:03.463 --> 00:20:05.896
I'm free!

00:20:05.896 --> 00:20:08.329
(Melissa)
How could we ever have
doubted him?

00:20:08.329 --> 00:20:11.529
Once again, Jack Atlas,
the Master of Faster,

00:20:11.529 --> 00:20:14.496
<i>wins the day!</i>

00:20:14.496 --> 00:20:17.396
Well done!
Good show, Jack ol' Boy!

00:20:17.396 --> 00:20:20.363
(cheering)

00:20:20.363 --> 00:20:22.496
(rapid beeping)

00:20:24.296 --> 00:20:25.329
I...

00:20:25.329 --> 00:20:28.563
No!

00:20:28.563 --> 00:20:30.463
(cheering)

00:20:30.463 --> 00:20:32.896
Atlas! Atlas! Atlas!

00:20:32.896 --> 00:20:35.363
Atlas! Atlas! Atlas!

00:20:35.363 --> 00:20:37.729
Atlas! Atlas! Atlas!
