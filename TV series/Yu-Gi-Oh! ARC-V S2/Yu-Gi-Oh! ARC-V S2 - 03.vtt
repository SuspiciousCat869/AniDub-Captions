00:00:04.833 --> 00:00:07.400
(Nico Smiley)
The Battle Royal
is now over!

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.400
They've taken on fiery flames,
icy icebergs, jungly jungles,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.000
and raucous ruins,
but nothing could stop them

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.866
from taking center stage
on our center court!

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.266
I know we had some
technical difficulties

00:00:19.266 --> 00:00:21.733
and couldn't watch
the duels in their entireties‐‐

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.400
sorry but no refunds, folks‐‐
so even I'm curious

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.066
to see who made it through
to the next round!

00:00:27.066 --> 00:00:28.900
And here they are now.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.400
Give it up for these eight
great dynamic duelists!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.233
(cheering)

00:00:34.233 --> 00:00:36.333
There's Yuya,
right in front.

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.366
And Zuzu's there, too!

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.300
(cheering)

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.233
The... great... eight!

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.400
I think I lost my appetite.
Reed didn't make it.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.366
You'll just have to feast
your eyes on Yuya and Zuzu then.

00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:00.300
Goosepickels! Goosepickels!
Goosepickels!

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.200
(cheering)

00:01:06.366 --> 00:01:09.800
Just look at Yuya and Zuzu‐‐
they're both totally exhausted.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.733
That Battle Royal must
have been rough on them.

00:01:12.733 --> 00:01:15.233
Hey, how come
Sylvio's down there?

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:19.166
(Frederick)
Ach! I thought that guy lost
to Yuya in the first round!

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:21.300
He's not the only one
who lost a duel.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.800
Aura lost, too, against
that ninja Moon Shadow.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.000
(man)
Hey, Sylvio! Did your
dad pull some strings?!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.066
(woman)
Yeah, Daddy,
the big politician!

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:32.733
(man)
You don't belong here!

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.066
(man)
You musta hacked
the live feed

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.200
and held it ransom so
you could get back in!

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.666
(man)
I don't know what you're
trying to sell us,

00:01:37.666 --> 00:01:38.966
ya cheater,
but we ain't buyin' it!

00:01:38.966 --> 00:01:40.933
(man)
Get outta here,
you loser!

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.933
(man)
Why don't you pack your bags
and go back to Daddy?

00:01:43.933 --> 00:01:45.266
Be quiet, all of you!

00:01:45.266 --> 00:01:48.000
I got here because of
one simple reason!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400
I got the skills
that give the chills,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:53.066
cause the thrills,
and pay the cable bills,

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.833
so silence all the banter,

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.100
and show some respect
to this Lancer!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.566
(woman)
A Lancer?!

00:01:58.566 --> 00:01:59.566
(woman)
Never heard of it.

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.000
(child)
What's a Lancer?

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.800
Stop acting so special!
My darling's also a Lancer,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.666
and he's better
than you, Sylvio!

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.400
Ladies and gentlemen, I have
an important announcement

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.600
to make on behalf
of the Leo Corporation.

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.533
I ask that you remain calm, as
this may come as a great shock.

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:19.166
Effective immediately,
the Arc League Championship

00:02:19.166 --> 00:02:23.233
will be...
suspended indefinitely!

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:24.666
(shocked reactions)

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:26.900
No way!
You gotta be kidding me!

There's certainly
no easy way to say this.

00:03:35.266 --> 00:03:37.733
The reason for suspending
the Championship is that,

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:39.933
during the Battle Royal,
an enemy force

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:43.066
from another dimension
has invaded our world!

00:03:43.066 --> 00:03:46.100
We've learned some
extremely disturbing facts

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.333
about how
this group operates.

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:49.066
As organizers
of this tournament,

00:03:49.066 --> 00:03:52.500
the Leo Institute feels
it's absolutely essential

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.400
to reveal the truth
about what's happening,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.933
no matter how ominous and
unsettlingly that truth is.

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.733
To invade the dimension
we live in,

00:03:59.733 --> 00:04:02.933
the invaders sent their
elite army Obelisk Force.

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:04.733
When we discovered this,

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:08.500
we decided to shut down the live
broadcast of the Battle Royal

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.266
to avoid causing panic not
only here in Paradise City

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.966
but throughout
the whole world.

00:04:16.233 --> 00:04:18.100
Invaders?
Another dimension?

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.166
(man)
What's an Obelisk Force?

00:04:19.166 --> 00:04:21.233
(man) They gotta be
pulling our duel disks!

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.166
(man)
No way!

00:04:22.166 --> 00:04:23.500
(man)
What's with the lies?

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.733
(Henrietta)
I understand
the cause for doubt,

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:30.000
but if you don't believe me,
see for yourselves!

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:31.933
Aah!

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.266
(gasping)

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:38.000
That's horrible!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.733
They turned him into a card!

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:42.533
Is that why we haven't
seen Dipper around?

00:04:42.533 --> 00:04:45.200
You think they turned him
into a card, too?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.166
It's shocking,
but this is the way

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.933
our enemies try to implement
their cruel plan!

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:52.066
Once they defeat
their opponents in duels,

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:55.166
they mercilessly
transform them into cards.

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:58.166
You lose a duel and
get turned into a card

00:04:58.166 --> 00:04:59.700
and it's all over?

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.400
Can all this
really be real?

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.666
It can't be.

00:05:02.666 --> 00:05:05.800
Ach!
It's card‐iclysmical!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.633
Hmm.

00:05:08.633 --> 00:05:10.333
But do not despair.

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:14.600
We were quite fortunate,
because during the Battle Royal,

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.400
our heroic duelists
were able to completely repel

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:18.600
the cruel invaders!

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.266
We owe them our thanks.

00:05:20.266 --> 00:05:24.133
Avenge those who have fallen
and destroy the enemy!

00:05:24.133 --> 00:05:26.833
Blitzing Bombardment!

00:05:26.833 --> 00:05:30.300
Aah!

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.233
All right!
In your face!

00:05:32.233 --> 00:05:33.766
How's that feel,
losers?

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.466
(laughing)

00:05:38.066 --> 00:05:40.233
Yah!

00:05:42.266 --> 00:05:45.466
(Sora)
The trap Fusion
Fortress'll save me!

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.033
Isn't that Sora?

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:48.400
(all)
Sora?!

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:50.600
(Henrietta)
These duelists
standing before you

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.600
will form an elite team
known as the Lancers

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.866
to take on any threats
coming our way.

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:59.666
(crowd)
Lancers! Lancers! Lancers!
Lancers!

00:05:59.666 --> 00:06:04.800
Lancers! Lancers!
Lancers! Lancers! Lancers!

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:08.100
The way she makes it sound,
Sora's one of the enemies.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.833
(Allie)
She's lying!
That can't be true!

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.066
Allie's right.

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.800
Sora's always
been our friend.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.833
I wonder
why Sora's dueling

00:06:15.833 --> 00:06:18.100
when he was already
out of the tournament?

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.333
Maybe he got a do‐over
like Sylvio did?

00:06:21.333 --> 00:06:23.933
But why was Sora
battling against Yuya?

00:06:23.933 --> 00:06:26.666
Whilst everyone was battling
against an enemy,

00:06:26.666 --> 00:06:28.733
the two of them would
have been the only ones

00:06:28.733 --> 00:06:31.800
having an ordinary
tournament duel.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:34.500
Thanks to the selfless actions
of these fearless Lancers,

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:36.766
our world is safe
for the moment.

00:06:36.766 --> 00:06:40.000
We don't know when our
enemies will attack again,

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
but we can be
certain they will.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:44.933
That is why we all
need to be prepared.

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:46.933
We must be able
to protect ourselves,

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:48.866
and the only way
to do that

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:51.633
is to train harder than
we ever have before.

00:06:51.633 --> 00:06:53.766
The Leo Institute will
provide the places

00:06:53.766 --> 00:06:56.166
and the courses
to make that happen.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.133
You must be
the new Lancers,

00:06:58.133 --> 00:07:00.866
the ones who will
save our world!

00:07:04.166 --> 00:07:06.200
(cheering)

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.900
(man)
I wanna be a Lancer!
Sign me up!

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.433
I'm ready, too!

00:07:09.433 --> 00:07:10.933
You on board, Kit?

00:07:10.933 --> 00:07:13.233
You better believe it,
Julia!

00:07:13.233 --> 00:07:16.566
(Declan)
The world has changed.

00:07:16.566 --> 00:07:19.333
The peaceful days of
happiness we all once knew

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:21.433
are sadly a thing
of the past now.

00:07:21.433 --> 00:07:23.733
We have just entered
a new age...

00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:25.666
an age of combat.

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:28.500
Because of this, all students
of the Leo Institute

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.733
will stand at the
front lines as soldiers.

00:07:30.733 --> 00:07:32.833
Special Ops Duelists.

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:35.233
Warriors for our world.

00:07:35.233 --> 00:07:36.633
All right!
That's sounds awesome!

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:37.600
I'll take
those invaders down!

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:38.733
Nobody messes
with our home!

00:07:38.733 --> 00:07:40.066
They don't stand
a chance!

00:07:40.066 --> 00:07:42.400
And even I, Declan Akaba,

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.300
will stand shoulder to
shoulder in battle with them!

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.700
Like legendary knights,
those who will stand

00:07:47.700 --> 00:07:50.666
on the front lines
are modern‐day warriors.

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:53.700
And like those honorable,
ancient heroes,

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:57.166
these Lancers will meet
their enemies and defeat them!

00:07:57.166 --> 00:08:00.266
(crowd)
Lancers rule!
Lancers rule!

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:03.266
Lancers rule! Lancers rule!

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:06.400
Lancers rule!
Lancers rule!

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:09.400
Lancers rule! Lancers rule!

00:08:09.400 --> 00:08:12.533
Lancers rule!
Lancers rule!

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:15.200
Lancers rule! Lancers...

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:18.066
Hey, where's Zuzu?

00:08:18.066 --> 00:08:19.466
Isn't she coming?

00:08:19.466 --> 00:08:21.400
Yeah, where is she?

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000
Oh!
Hey, isn't that Zuzu's?

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:31.700
(groaning)

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:35.200
What are you
doing with it?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.333
I'm sorry,
but Zuzu's gone.

00:08:37.333 --> 00:08:38.566
Ah!

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:40.300
(Frederick)
Gone shopping
for a new shirt?

00:08:40.300 --> 00:08:42.600
(Yuya)
No, she's gone!
Gone, gone!

00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:44.000
(Allie)
But we saw her!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.333
She came back with you
and the others!

00:08:46.333 --> 00:08:50.366
That wasn't her.
That girl wasn't Zuzu.

00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:53.333
Huh? What do you mean
she's not Zuzu?

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:55.566
Stop pulling
my lederhosen.

00:08:55.566 --> 00:08:58.500
She looks just like Zuzu,
but her name is Celina.

00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.966
Celina?!

00:08:59.966 --> 00:09:01.733
While the Battle Royal
was going on,

00:09:01.733 --> 00:09:05.033
they swapped clothes and
took each other's place.

00:09:05.033 --> 00:09:06.600
They changed clothes?

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:08.100
Why would they do that?

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:13.833
Zuzu opened my eyes
to the truth, Yuya.

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:15.666
I'm through
with the Professor.

00:09:15.666 --> 00:09:17.900
She risked everything
to help me,

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.133
and now I'm going
to return the favor.

00:09:21.133 --> 00:09:23.200
I promise I'll do
whatever it takes

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.133
to rescue her
from Duel Academy.

00:09:25.133 --> 00:09:29.166
I'll fight them with all
my might... as a Lancer.

00:09:29.166 --> 00:09:31.266
You have my word.

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.733
(groaning)
I'll get her back!

00:09:41.733 --> 00:09:44.400
Just tell me where
this Duel Academy is!

00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:46.666
Where is it!?
Tell me, Yuya!

00:09:46.666 --> 00:09:49.233
I'm‐‐ I'm afraid
it's not that simple.

00:09:49.233 --> 00:09:50.933
I'll make it simple
for ya!

00:09:50.933 --> 00:09:53.166
You tell me the where
and don't worry about the how!

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:56.166
I'll find whoever took her
and take her back!

00:09:56.166 --> 00:09:57.833
Zuzu...

00:09:57.833 --> 00:10:01.066
(crying)

00:10:08.066 --> 00:10:12.366
I'm sorry, but Zuzu's
in another dimension.

00:10:12.366 --> 00:10:15.866
Huh? Did you say
"dimension"?!

00:10:15.866 --> 00:10:19.100
But the Lancers and I are
gonna rescue her.

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:20.633
Not without me,
you aren't.

00:10:20.633 --> 00:10:22.966
I'm not going to sit
here and do nothing!

00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:25.833
I'll pound the enemy
into a pfannkuchen!

00:10:25.833 --> 00:10:27.466
Count me in too!

00:10:27.466 --> 00:10:29.366
Wherever Yuya goes,
I go!

00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:31.300
Got it?!

00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:33.733
Whatever, you two.
I don't need a crystal ball

00:10:33.733 --> 00:10:35.600
to see that you
don't have the skills.

00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:38.400
If anyone's going with
my darling, it's gonna be me,

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.666
so get in line.

00:10:39.666 --> 00:10:41.533
Calm your horses, Aura.

00:10:41.533 --> 00:10:43.866
What say we let them do
some talking

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:45.633
while you and Gong
do some walking.

00:10:45.633 --> 00:10:46.800
Don't worry.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.700
Yuya'll be fine.

00:10:51.133 --> 00:10:52.466
Huh?
Huh?

00:10:55.066 --> 00:10:56.466
Dad!
Sorry, Aura,

00:10:56.466 --> 00:10:59.200
but our chit‐chat's
gonna have to wait.

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:06.000
(Yuya)
I'll find Zuzu!
I swear I will!

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.100
What a man!

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.333
And nobody's gonna
stand in my way!

00:11:09.333 --> 00:11:12.066
I'll go wherever I have to
to get Zuzu back,

00:11:12.066 --> 00:11:14.333
and I'll do
whatever's necessary

00:11:14.333 --> 00:11:16.366
to defeat all our enemies!

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:18.033
When you say "enemies,"

00:11:18.033 --> 00:11:19.900
does that mean Sora
as well?

00:11:19.900 --> 00:11:21.333
Huh?

00:11:21.333 --> 00:11:22.500
Come with me.

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:25.666
Uhh...
Mom, what're you doing!?

00:11:25.666 --> 00:11:27.833
Teaching you a lesson
you'll never forget!

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:29.833
Now move it
before I lose it!

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:32.466
Uh‐oh, I don't like
the sounds o' this.

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:34.266
(Frederick)
Wait for me.

00:11:40.333 --> 00:11:41.833
Why would my darling's mom

00:11:41.833 --> 00:11:44.033
take everyone
to an abandoned arcade?

00:11:44.033 --> 00:11:45.333
I hope she has better taste

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:47.833
when it comes to Yuya's
and my wedding reception.

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.433
(engines revving)

00:11:49.433 --> 00:11:50.500
Huh?
Huh?

00:12:00.566 --> 00:12:03.200
Feels good to be back
in the saddle again!

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.533
Mom, what's with the get‐up
and the motorcycle?

00:12:06.533 --> 00:12:08.100
Don't call me Mom!

00:12:08.100 --> 00:12:10.000
Call me the Queen
of the Sirens!

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.833
The Queen of the Sirens!?

00:12:11.833 --> 00:12:13.966
What is they!?

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:16.166
Years back before
Yoko was Yuya's mom,

00:12:16.166 --> 00:12:17.900
she was part of
a team o' lady bikers

00:12:17.900 --> 00:12:20.466
that caused a pretty big
stir in Paradise City.

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:21.800
That's an understatement!

00:12:21.800 --> 00:12:23.366
I was the big,
bad boss lady,

00:12:23.366 --> 00:12:26.366
and nobody messed
with us on my watch!

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:27.500
That's right.

00:12:27.500 --> 00:12:29.166
They used to call me
Loco Yoko!

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.766
Loco Yoko?

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:33.466
Yeah, that sounds about
right with how you're acting.

00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:35.833
This isn't the time
for jokes, Yuya!

00:12:35.833 --> 00:12:38.300
But it is time to pop
the clutch on this duel!

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:41.866
I activate the Action Field
Pier Of Peril!

00:12:41.866 --> 00:12:45.133
(computer voice)
Augmented Reality Combat
System energized.

00:12:45.133 --> 00:12:47.500
Generating Action Field.

00:12:51.433 --> 00:12:53.033
I'm about to teach you
a lesson!

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:54.333
Teach me a lesson?

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:56.300
But I already finished
all my homework.

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.033
Besides,
this is embarrassing.

00:12:58.033 --> 00:13:00.033
There's no way I'm
gonna duel my own mother.

00:13:00.033 --> 00:13:03.100
Nobody says no to
the Queen of the Sirens!

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:08.500
Look out, Yuya, 'cause
Loco Yoko's back on the scene

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.333
and she's about to lay down
some serious tracks!

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:14.300
Here I come!

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:18.166
Hit the brakes!

00:13:18.166 --> 00:13:20.366
The Queen of the Sirens
only knows one speed,

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.000
and that's supersonic!

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.200
The pedals to the metal,
and there's no slowing down!

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.466
Let's get this battle
brawling already!

00:13:27.466 --> 00:13:30.066
Uh, Mom,
I mean "Queen Siren,"

00:13:30.066 --> 00:13:32.600
any chance we can
take a pit stop?

00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:34.133
Aura, remember to stay

00:13:34.133 --> 00:13:36.200
on your future
mother‐in‐law's good side.

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.300
Back in my day,
to get respect,

00:13:38.300 --> 00:13:40.200
you had to show power.

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.700
And dueling was the way
to prove I had it.

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:46.066
(engine revving)

00:13:46.066 --> 00:13:47.933
And I proved it
over and over,

00:13:47.933 --> 00:13:51.433
not just for me, but for
the rest of the Sirens!

00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:52.933
I liked you better
when you made me

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:54.866
pancakes
in the morning!

00:13:56.966 --> 00:14:00.000
Well the only thing
I'm serving up now is defeat!

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.866
I don't what you're
trying to prove, Mom,

00:14:01.866 --> 00:14:03.700
but if it's a duel
you're looking for,

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.866
it's a duel you'll get!

00:14:10.833 --> 00:14:14.066
When I win, you'd better
not dock my allowance!

00:14:14.066 --> 00:14:16.166
I'm not gonna
shortchange you,

00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:18.200
not like you're
trying to do to Sora.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.466
What does Sora have to do
with any of this?

00:14:20.466 --> 00:14:24.166
Everything, and Loco Yoko's
more than happy to show you why!

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:25.600
Bring it.

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:28.566
(both)
Let's duel!

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:35.433
(both)
Let's Duel!

00:14:35.433 --> 00:14:37.900
(computer voice)
Action Cards dispersed.

00:14:37.900 --> 00:14:40.133
To get this show
started right,

00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.700
I summon
Performapal Salutiger!

00:14:46.433 --> 00:14:48.466
And thanks to Salutiger,
I can summon

00:14:48.466 --> 00:14:51.000
Performapal Helpprincess
to the stage as well!

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:54.333
With that,
I end my turn.

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:55.766
Your move, Mom.

00:14:55.766 --> 00:14:57.300
Defeat her,
my darling!

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:59.266
Because the way your mom's
been treating you,

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:01.700
she's the one who
deserves to be grounded!

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:03.466
That was a good move...

00:15:03.466 --> 00:15:05.700
notice how I didn't
say "great move."

00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:07.566
I think someone
needs a timeout,

00:15:07.566 --> 00:15:08.933
and it's not me!

00:15:08.933 --> 00:15:11.800
When I was the leader
of the Sirens,

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.266
taking five was
never an option.

00:15:14.266 --> 00:15:17.133
I had to be tough as nails
'cause every duelist in town

00:15:17.133 --> 00:15:18.866
wanted a piece of us.

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:21.300
But all they got was
a piece of humble pie!

00:15:21.300 --> 00:15:23.466
They knew not to mess
with any of the Sirens,

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:25.766
because they knew
if they messed with my friends,

00:15:25.766 --> 00:15:27.566
they were messing
with me.

00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.766
But some people didn't
get the message.

00:15:29.766 --> 00:15:31.533
They'd come back
over and over,

00:15:31.533 --> 00:15:34.933
and I'd beat them again
and again.

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:36.800
Eventually though,
since they weren't able

00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.466
to beat me fair and square,

00:15:38.466 --> 00:15:42.233
they decided to start
taking shortcuts.

00:15:42.233 --> 00:15:44.433
(man)
Nice of you to show up.

00:15:44.433 --> 00:15:46.800
Your friend was hoping
you'd stop by!

00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:48.300
So this is what
it's come to?

00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:50.333
You punks really
are psycho.

00:15:50.333 --> 00:15:52.000
Thanks for
the compliment.

00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:53.366
You're too kind.

00:15:53.366 --> 00:15:55.100
How low can
you creeps go!?

00:15:55.100 --> 00:15:57.300
That's just what
we're tryin' to find out.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.333
We had to do somethin' special
to get your attention, right?

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.400
You let her go,
or you'll regret it!

00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:05.666
We won't mess with your
pretty little protégé,

00:16:05.666 --> 00:16:08.333
that is, as long as
you beat us!

00:16:08.333 --> 00:16:10.400
All right then...

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.600
let's get
this battle started.

00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:15.533
It's my turn now,
I draw!

00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:18.300
It's time for me to rev
my engine, spin my wheels,

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:20.000
and kick things
up a notch!

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:21.533
I summon...

00:16:21.533 --> 00:16:23.533
my Road Raven Renegade!

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.300
Let's go!
I'll take you all on at once!

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:39.133
Heh, you sure do
talk big...

00:16:39.133 --> 00:16:41.900
but you won't when
we get through with you!

00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:44.200
(man)
You boys are taking
all the fun out of this.

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.466
I see sneering
and snickering,

00:16:48.466 --> 00:16:50.700
but no smiles.

00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:52.566
Huh? Who said that?

00:16:52.566 --> 00:16:53.933
Who's up there?

00:16:53.933 --> 00:16:56.400
You're turning dueling
into fighting.

00:16:56.400 --> 00:16:59.166
And that's not the way
it's supposed to work.

00:16:59.166 --> 00:17:01.466
This is none of
your business‐‐ get lost!

00:17:01.466 --> 00:17:03.066
Yeah, beat it,
we settle things

00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:04.400
our own way here!

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.633
Disappear or you're
gonna regret it, pal!

00:17:06.633 --> 00:17:09.900
I really don't think
I'll regret anything.

00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:10.733
What?!
You little twerp!

00:17:10.733 --> 00:17:12.366
Who do you
think you are?

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:13.533
Come down here
an' say that!

00:17:13.533 --> 00:17:14.933
I'll be
more than happy to

00:17:14.933 --> 00:17:16.633
because you're
dueling out of spite,

00:17:16.633 --> 00:17:18.366
and dueling has
nothing to do with that.

00:17:18.366 --> 00:17:20.166
They're holding
my friend!

00:17:20.166 --> 00:17:23.233
What am I supposed to do,
forget about her?!

00:17:23.233 --> 00:17:25.533
Even if you're
forced to duel...

00:17:25.533 --> 00:17:29.233
you still have to duel
with a smile!

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:31.366
Now I'm gonna
rev things up

00:17:31.366 --> 00:17:33.866
by tributing
Red Raven Renegade...

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:40.833
...to summon
Road Raven Red Queen!

00:17:49.833 --> 00:17:51.366
Red Queen lets me
take control

00:17:51.366 --> 00:17:52.933
of all your monsters,

00:17:52.933 --> 00:17:54.733
because Red Queen is
a natural leader,

00:17:54.733 --> 00:17:56.700
just like me!

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:00.033
Now I've got control of
all the monsters on your field!

00:18:00.033 --> 00:18:01.466
Haa!

00:18:04.566 --> 00:18:06.366
Aah!

00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:11.833
Thanks, Mom!

00:18:11.833 --> 00:18:13.400
Nice way to treat
your own son!

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.033
It's not as bad as you think

00:18:15.033 --> 00:18:16.266
because the monster's
attack points

00:18:16.266 --> 00:18:18.366
I just took control of
drop to a hundred.

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:23.833
But it will be once I activate
a little something known as...

00:18:23.833 --> 00:18:26.800
The spell card
SMILE WORLD!

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:33.133
All monsters gain
100 attack points

00:18:33.133 --> 00:18:35.100
for every monster
on the field.

00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:37.200
There are
three monsters out,

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.000
so each one gets
300 extra attack points!

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.100
Whoa.
They're all smiling!

00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:55.966
(all)
Huh?

00:18:58.766 --> 00:19:00.833
(laughing)

00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:09.433
(both laughing)

00:19:09.433 --> 00:19:11.100
Here I go!

00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:13.566
Performapal Salutiger,
attack!

00:19:13.566 --> 00:19:15.233
(growling)

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:18.966
Aah!

00:19:20.766 --> 00:19:22.600
Performapal
Helpprincess,

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:24.700
give Yuya
a not‐so‐helping hand!

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:26.466
(chuckling)

00:19:30.066 --> 00:19:34.300
Now Road Raven Red Queen,
throttle him!

00:19:39.333 --> 00:19:41.600
(whimpering)

00:19:50.166 --> 00:19:52.366
Your friend is
safe and sound.

00:19:52.366 --> 00:19:54.133
I hope you see,

00:19:54.133 --> 00:19:57.633
sometimes a smile is
the simplest solution.

00:19:57.633 --> 00:19:58.900
(Mom)
That man...

00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:00.366
the one who appeared
from nowhere

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:02.433
and saved my friend...

00:20:02.433 --> 00:20:05.766
that man was
your father.

00:20:08.900 --> 00:20:11.266
He stole my friend back
from those thugs,

00:20:11.266 --> 00:20:13.033
but he stole
my heart as well.

00:20:13.033 --> 00:20:15.500
And he did it without
anyone getting hurt.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.200
Yuya, I hope you can be
more like your dad,

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.700
because if you can't,

00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:22.066
you won't only fail
to save Sora,

00:20:22.066 --> 00:20:25.000
but you'll fail
yourself as well.
