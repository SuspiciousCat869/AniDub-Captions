Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.733
(Melissa)
Once again, Jack Atlas
proves he has plenty o' pluck

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:09.666
and snatchesvictory from
the jaws of destruction!

00:00:09.666 --> 00:00:13.666
The protesters have spread out
all across New Domino City.

00:00:13.666 --> 00:00:15.866
Attention, people
of New Domino!

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.766
The chaos you are witnessing
in our fine city is proof

00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:20.800
that the High Council
has failed you!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.666
To ensure order, I have no
choice but to assume

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.500
fullauthority over this city
and its government

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.533
He's lying!

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:32.033
He's using the chaos
so he can take over the City!

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:35.866
But people‐‐ both Commons and
Topsiders‐‐ you can't let him!

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.533
The City belongs to you!!

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.466
So you gotta
work together...

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:41.100
Zuzu!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.700
Yuya, if you can hear me,

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.800
you have to convince them to
stopfighting with each
other.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.533
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:50.066
Dueltain your way
into their hearts!

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:51.466
Yuya!

00:00:51.466 --> 00:00:52.833
Hop on!

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.266
<i>Your attention, please!</i>

00:00:57.266 --> 00:00:59.633
Jack Atlas and I are about
to duke it out

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.366
in the final bout
of the Friendship Cup!

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:04.600
I will have
to shut you down!

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.000
<i>I regret to inform you</i>

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.333
that the council has relieved
you of yourduties, Roget.

00:01:09.333 --> 00:01:13.066
We are also ordering all
security forces to disengage

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:14.700
<i>from further combat.</i>

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.966
Jack and I will put on a show
guaranteed to rock every
block

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.433
<i>in this metropolis!</i>

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:20.966
<i>And when it's over.</i>

00:01:20.966 --> 00:01:23.233
you're gonna find
that there's a new King!

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.966

To the protestors
who disagree with my rule...

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.033
Who think they have the right to
stand in defiance against me...

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:37.766
Let me remind you all...

00:02:37.766 --> 00:02:42.766
That I, Jean Michel Roget,
am the one and only person

00:02:42.766 --> 00:02:45.533
who decides what
happens in my city!

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.466
So if you're not backing down,

00:02:47.466 --> 00:02:51.133
I will be forced
to break you down!

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.700
(Roget)
Attention all Sector
Security units...

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.100
Enter the Duel Palace
and arrest Yuya,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.466
Jack and the rest
of thetraitors.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.966
(whimpering)

00:03:13.733 --> 00:03:14.966
Guess they got
scared and decided

00:03:14.966 --> 00:03:16.733
to hightail it
outta here.

00:03:16.733 --> 00:03:19.033
They can run,
but they can't hide!

00:03:19.033 --> 00:03:20.533
Let's get 'em!

00:03:20.533 --> 00:03:23.366
(man)
Time to rock
and roll 'em!

00:03:23.366 --> 00:03:25.400
(overlapping shouts)

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.633
Looks like Security's finally
found us!

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.900
We can't let them stop Yuya
from dueling Jack

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.633
when the whole City's watching!

00:03:31.633 --> 00:03:33.800
(screaming)

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.100
(Gong)
You're up Sylvio!

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:36.566
Sylvio's up!

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:39.500
And he's ready to bring
the house down!

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.666
And action!

00:03:40.666 --> 00:03:44.333
Abyss Actor ‐ Superstar
upstage the competition!

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:51.633
Flower Cardian Lightshower,
time for you to slice and dice!

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:53.233

00:03:55.566 --> 00:03:56.633

Ravaging Rebellion!

00:04:04.433 --> 00:04:06.233
Enough tiptoeing around

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:08.333
it's time to end
this once and for all!

00:04:08.333 --> 00:04:09.933
Ragnarok attack!

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.533
And show them
who reigns supreme!

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:26.700
Who do these Lancers
think they are?

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.566
Their interference
is going to ruin everything!

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.733
(guards groaning)

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:37.566
Riley...

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.966
(Riley)
Sector Security...

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.066
If you've
got the stuff, kid.

00:04:51.066 --> 00:04:54.033
Then don't be afraid to use it,
'cause when you do,

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.266
there won't be anybody
who'll be able to stop you.

00:04:58.966 --> 00:05:01.233
Listen up, Sector Security!

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.100
You don't have a chance
of beating me!

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.500
I'm gonna be gritty, just like
Jack said, so watch out!

00:05:13.866 --> 00:05:16.000
I Synchro Summon!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
C/C/C Rock Blaster
of Battle!

00:05:25.233 --> 00:05:26.500
Here goes.

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.866
Rock Blaster of Battle, come on,
let's rock this battle!

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.666
Huh?

00:05:41.033 --> 00:05:42.900
Pretty good, huh?

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.200
(guards groaning)

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.600
Whoa... Those guys
trashed Security!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.533
They totally hammered 'em.

00:05:48.533 --> 00:05:51.700
Then there's nobody left to stop
us from taking over this place!

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.100
Oh, yeah!

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.533
And the first thing we oughta do
is empty out the trash!

00:05:56.533 --> 00:06:00.533
(man)
And that means you Topsiders
are getting the heave ho!

00:06:00.533 --> 00:06:02.866
Let's show 'em who's boss!

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:04.233
(overlapping shouts)

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:05.300
(Jack)
<i>Back off!</i>

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:06.500
Whoa.
Huh?

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.800
Let me make one
thing perfectly clear...

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.000
In the Duel Palace, there are
only battles on the track,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.566
<i>notoff the track.</i>

00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:17.566
Everyone is equal here, so no
one is kicking anyone out,

00:06:17.566 --> 00:06:18.900
but if you want
to watch my duel,

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:21.533
both Commons
and Topsidersalike,

00:06:21.533 --> 00:06:24.100
then you're more
than welcome to stay.

00:06:24.100 --> 00:06:26.266
The Friendship Cup
has to have a champion.

00:06:26.266 --> 00:06:29.200
And tonight we
shall find out who!

00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.766
So get set to watch the duel
of your lives New Domino!

00:06:33.766 --> 00:06:36.200
(Roget)
He must be out of his mind!

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.066
The poor sap
still believes

00:06:38.066 --> 00:06:40.666
he's the people's champion.

00:06:42.066 --> 00:06:45.033
Fine, enjoy this last duel
while you can.

00:06:45.033 --> 00:06:46.600
Because once it's done,

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:49.000
I'm locking you up
and throwing away the key

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.900
and then I'll take
my rightful place

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.833
as the people's champion.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:58.633
♪

00:06:58.633 --> 00:07:00.600
Oh, Yuya...

00:07:02.566 --> 00:07:04.433
(Melissa)
If Jack Atlas says
this battle's

00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:06.333
gonna be the duel of our lives,

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:08.666
I better bring on
the broadcasting!

00:07:08.666 --> 00:07:11.300
This battle's gonna crown
a champion tonight

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:13.366
and I've gotta give
the rootin'est,

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.900
tootin'est commentary
this city has ever seen!

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:19.733
Now, this hasn't been the
friendliest of Friendship Cup's

00:07:19.733 --> 00:07:22.600
I mean, it was supposed to bring
the City together as one,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.166
to have some fun!

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:25.800
Maybe it's not too late.

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:32.833
(Melissa)
Ladies and gents,
young'uns and youngettes...

00:07:32.833 --> 00:07:36.400
Exploding onto the scene
is Yuya Sakaki!

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:40.966
You gotta
win this, Yuya!

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:42.866
So that means no losing!

00:07:42.866 --> 00:07:45.066
Oh, yeah!

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:46.733
Y'know what
I need, Tokmuatsu?

00:07:46.733 --> 00:07:48.133
An agent.

00:07:48.133 --> 00:07:50.633
I'm just as good a duelist
as Yuya is but he's the one

00:07:50.633 --> 00:07:52.266
who gets all the top gigs!

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:53.533
Before you find an agent,

00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:55.600
you might want to find
some talent first.

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.900
Maybe take a class or two.

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.300
Am I right, Sam?

00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:00.466
Seems like a tall order
if you ask me.

00:08:00.466 --> 00:08:01.700
Listen, pipsqueak!

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.966
I have more talent
in my little finger

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:06.333
than Yuya has in his
entire body!

00:08:06.333 --> 00:08:07.333
(Gong)
Quiet!

00:08:07.333 --> 00:08:08.366
(all)
Huh?

00:08:08.366 --> 00:08:10.233
Here comes a real star.

00:08:10.233 --> 00:08:12.466
Jack Atlas is about
to make his entrance.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:16.766
(Melissa)
And now, soaring
through the sky is my hero,

00:08:16.766 --> 00:08:22.900
your hero, even yourcats'
and dogs' hero, Jack Atlas!

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:25.833
(cheering and applause)

00:08:25.833 --> 00:08:27.333
Who's the one
Master of Faster?

00:08:27.333 --> 00:08:28.800
Who rules the duels?

00:08:28.800 --> 00:08:30.533
That's right, it's me!

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:32.400
It's really him!

00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:39.400
(Melissa)
Jack Atlas always has what it
takes to truly fire things up!

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:41.500
He's the pride
of this here City,

00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:43.300
<i>the star of stars,</i>

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.366
the King of the
competition!

00:08:45.366 --> 00:08:48.366
But he's gonna face
his toughest test yet!

00:08:48.366 --> 00:08:51.200
The Friendship Cup
has come full circle.

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:54.333
It started with a duel
betweenYuya and Jack, and this
here's

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:56.633
<i>their rematch for it all!</i>

00:08:56.633 --> 00:08:59.366
Hey, there Jack,
long time no duel.

00:08:59.366 --> 00:09:01.800
You ready to put
on a show for these folks?

00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:04.133
That all depends on you!

00:09:04.133 --> 00:09:05.300
(gasps)

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.866
So far you've done
nothing to impress.

00:09:07.866 --> 00:09:09.900
You think you've been
entertaining the crowd,

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:11.266
well guess again!

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:12.600
You want to be
a dueltainer,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.266
but you're nothing
but a class clown.

00:09:14.266 --> 00:09:16.666
And you're
the only one laughing.

00:09:16.666 --> 00:09:18.166
(gasps)

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:21.033
That isn't true, Jack!

00:09:21.033 --> 00:09:22.833
And I'm not a class clown.

00:09:22.833 --> 00:09:26.066
I know I have what it takes
toput smiles back on the
faces

00:09:26.066 --> 00:09:31.000
of everyone in New Domino
City, and my friends know it
too!

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:32.466
You tell 'em!

00:09:32.466 --> 00:09:34.466
(Yuya)
<i>It's showtime, Jack!</i>

00:09:34.466 --> 00:09:35.933
We must move.

00:09:35.933 --> 00:09:39.033
And I'm ready to show
everyone what dueling is all
about!

00:09:39.033 --> 00:09:41.966
A friend told me to dueltain
myway into the hearts of
everyone

00:09:41.966 --> 00:09:44.466
in this city,
and that's what I'm gonna do!

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:49.633
Oh, so you really think
you can entertain my crowd?

00:09:49.633 --> 00:09:52.600
You think you've
got what it takes.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.433
We'll see about that.

00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:55.733
Now, let's swing into action

00:09:55.733 --> 00:09:58.366
and see if you fall flat
on your face!

00:09:58.366 --> 00:10:01.766
This'll be one finale
of a final!

00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:04.400
<i>So without further ado...</i>

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.133
Let's get this
rodeo started!

00:10:07.133 --> 00:10:10.666
Can Yuya Sakaki dueltain his
way to victory

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:14.800
or will Jack Atlas
have the last laugh?

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.066
<i>The battle begins now!</i>

00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:21.166
Let's fire up the Action
Field, Crossover
Acceleration!

00:10:21.166 --> 00:10:22.333
(computer)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:10:22.333 --> 00:10:23.866
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:10:24.966 --> 00:10:26.433
(Melissa)
<i>On your marks...</i>

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:28.233
<i>Get set...</i>

00:10:28.233 --> 00:10:29.566
<i>Go!</i>

00:10:31.066 --> 00:10:32.200
(both)
Let's duel!

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:38.166
I'll kick things
into overdrive!

00:10:38.166 --> 00:10:41.233
By summoning a monster that's
sure to help speed my way

00:10:41.233 --> 00:10:43.500
to victory, Red Sprinter!

00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:47.800
And since this is the only
monster on the field,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:50.600
I can summon one Level
3‐or‐below Tuner Monster

00:10:50.600 --> 00:10:51.600
from my hand.

00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:53.233
And I choose this one...

00:10:53.233 --> 00:10:54.466
Reveal yourself...

00:10:54.466 --> 00:10:56.633
Red Resonator!

00:10:56.633 --> 00:10:58.666
(Red Resonator cackling)

00:11:00.533 --> 00:11:03.500
And watch now as my
Level 2 Red Resonator tunes

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:05.733
with Level 4 Red Sprinter!

00:11:05.733 --> 00:11:07.933
(cackling)

00:11:07.933 --> 00:11:10.833
Witness the power of this
ultimate pairing!

00:11:10.833 --> 00:11:14.700
Witness the power of my...

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:16.633
Synchro Summon!

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:17.633
Now rise...

00:11:17.633 --> 00:11:21.366
Red Wyvern!

00:11:21.366 --> 00:11:22.666
(Melissa)
<i>Whoa! Looks like Jack's</i>

00:11:22.666 --> 00:11:24.333
counting on history
repeating itself,

00:11:24.333 --> 00:11:26.666
because he's making
the exact same moves

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.466
as his first duel
against Yuya!

00:11:28.466 --> 00:11:31.566
Question is though...
Can Yuya rewrite history

00:11:31.566 --> 00:11:33.633
and give it a different
ending thistime?

00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.433
(Yuya)
That's no accident.

00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:43.233
It's Jack's way of testing me,
to see if I stepped my game up.

00:11:43.233 --> 00:11:45.366
Now that you've seen
my firepower...

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:48.266
I'll end my turn.

00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:49.900
You're in the spotlight now,
Yuya!

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:52.300
And it's time to show us
how you handle the heat!

00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:54.866
Thanks, Jack, I will!

00:11:54.866 --> 00:11:56.733
And the crowds gonna eat up...

00:11:56.733 --> 00:11:59.833
My next move's gonna
sizzle with excitement!

00:11:59.833 --> 00:12:03.100
(Yuya)
Dad, this is for you.

00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:04.733
It's showtime!

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.400
(Yuya)
It's showtime!

00:12:13.166 --> 00:12:15.200
(Jack)
We'll see about that!

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.166
(no audio)

00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:19.100
(guard groaning)

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:20.533
(Sora)
We're in.

00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:23.900
Saving Zuzu will be easier
than taking candy from a baby...

00:12:29.466 --> 00:12:31.600
(Melissa)
The Friendship Cup
is just getting going!

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:34.333
But the action is already
heating up!

00:12:34.333 --> 00:12:37.466
Jack Atlas summoned his
powerful Red Wyvern

00:12:37.466 --> 00:12:40.666
and it's ready to
roast the competition.

00:12:40.666 --> 00:12:43.933
(Yuya)
Zuzu said only I could stop
the fighting between the Commons

00:12:43.933 --> 00:12:45.200
and Topsiders.

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:47.066
And to do that
I gotta put on a show

00:12:47.066 --> 00:12:49.700
that will have everyone on
the edge of their seats!

00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:51.933
Here goes!

00:12:51.933 --> 00:12:53.800
Let's get started!

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:57.800
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale 1 Performapal Gumgumouton

00:12:57.800 --> 00:13:00.900
and Scale 5 Performapal
Bubblebowwow!

00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:05.633
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:13:05.633 --> 00:13:08.500
I'm allowed to summon monsters
between Level 2 and 4

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:09.500
at the same time.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:11.733
Swing far pendulum!

00:13:11.733 --> 00:13:14.466
Carve the arc of victory!

00:13:14.466 --> 00:13:19.966
My monsters are ready to swing
into action!

00:13:19.966 --> 00:13:22.900
It's go time,
Timebreaker Magician!

00:13:24.466 --> 00:13:28.200
And now that I'm all finished up
Pendulum Summoning...

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:32.266
I'm summoning Performapal ‐
Radish Horse!

00:13:32.266 --> 00:13:33.633
(squeals)

00:13:35.133 --> 00:13:36.700
Wait, a minute guys...

00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.400
If Pendulum Summoning lets you
summon a whole lot of monsters

00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.800
all at once...

00:13:40.800 --> 00:13:44.066
How come Yuya summoned those
two monsters one at a time?

00:13:44.066 --> 00:13:46.233
Huh?
Huh?

00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:48.166
(Yuya)
<i>Check this out!</i>

00:13:48.166 --> 00:13:49.100
(all)
Huh?

00:13:51.133 --> 00:13:54.600
Timebreaker Magician
just gained attack points.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.000
That's some magic trick!
That's some magic trick!

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.833
When Timebreaker Magician is
Pendulum Summoned all by itself,

00:13:59.833 --> 00:14:02.800
its attack points get doubled!

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.866
So that's why Yuya didn't
Pendulum Summon both monsters

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:07.433
at the same time!

00:14:07.433 --> 00:14:10.533
Yuya's sure full of surprises
and now his Magician's

00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:11.966
full of attack points!

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:14.666
Betcha Jack never saw
that coming...

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:16.200
A clever move, Yuya.

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:17.333
Of course it's clever.

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:19.466
It's exactly what
I would've done.

00:14:19.466 --> 00:14:22.200
(Yuya)
So far, so good.

00:14:25.033 --> 00:14:27.000
And Mom...

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.133
Dad...

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:31.466
I promise it's only
gonna get better!

00:14:31.466 --> 00:14:34.566
Ladies and gents, may I have
your attention, please?

00:14:34.566 --> 00:14:37.100
I now present for your
entertainment pleasure

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:39.000
a most unusual card...

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.000
A spell that'll turn
your frowns upside down!

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.466
Now, I, Yuya Sakaki, will
utilize this lovable, laughable,

00:14:45.466 --> 00:14:49.266
fantastically fun card to get
you grinning from ear to ear!

00:14:49.266 --> 00:14:53.733
So show me those happy faces
and your pearly whites!

00:14:53.733 --> 00:14:55.100
Or not!

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.100
Now, get ready to get happy,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:01.433
'cause here comes Smile World!

00:15:01.433 --> 00:15:05.300
With this stunningly sunny
spell card, all monsters gain

00:15:05.300 --> 00:15:08.066
100 attack points for every
monster on the field

00:15:08.066 --> 00:15:09.900
until the end
of the turn.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:11.666
That goes for all monsters
on the field...

00:15:11.666 --> 00:15:14.766
That means Jack's Red Wyvern
also gains attack points.

00:15:14.766 --> 00:15:16.666
Was that smart
on Yuya's part?

00:15:16.666 --> 00:15:19.333
I know Yuya wants to make
everyone smile...

00:15:19.333 --> 00:15:21.700
But Gong didn't think
that meant Jack Atlas!

00:15:21.700 --> 00:15:24.766
I'd never make a bonehead
move like that!

00:15:24.766 --> 00:15:26.333
It's curtains for Yuya!

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:29.433
Since there are three monsters
in play right now,

00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:33.266
each one of 'em gets
an extra 300 attack points!

00:15:34.633 --> 00:15:38.500
But hold your horses for Radish
Horse's special ability!

00:15:38.500 --> 00:15:43.200
It's blowing its top because Red
Wyvern loses 800 attack points!

00:15:46.933 --> 00:15:49.866
And one monster on my field
gets to gain the same number

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:52.266
of attack points that
it just lost!

00:15:52.266 --> 00:15:54.200
And I'm giving these
extra attack points

00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.533
to Timebreaker
Magician!

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:59.166
And he's gonna gallop
his way to victory!

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.433
(all)
Yuya sure
isn't horsing around!

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:09.300
Yuya knew exactly what
he was doing all along.

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.600
'Course he did.
If anyone can give Jack

00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:13.600
a run for his money,
it's Yuya.

00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.333
Yuya played it exactly
the way I would have.

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:19.866
This is certainly a stunning
turn of events, folks!

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:23.166
This duel's been
so much fun.

00:16:23.166 --> 00:16:26.133
It's great to be back
on the track and back to doing

00:16:26.133 --> 00:16:27.566
what I do best,

00:16:27.566 --> 00:16:30.133
entertaining the crowd
and making dad proud!

00:16:30.133 --> 00:16:32.700
It's time to break
this duel wide open!

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:34.600
Timebreaker!

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.933
Trample Red Wyvern!

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.633
(Jack)
You're entertaining no one!

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:45.433
You haven't learned a thing
since our last duel!

00:16:45.433 --> 00:16:49.466
I activate the trap
King's Synchro!

00:16:49.466 --> 00:16:52.000
When you attack a Synchro
Monster on my field,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:54.833
King's Synchro stops it cold.

00:16:54.833 --> 00:16:58.200
Then I can Synchro Summon using
Red Wyvern and a Tuner Monster

00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.800
in my graveyard!

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.366
I tune Level 2 Red Resonator
with Level 6 Red Wyvern!

00:17:07.633 --> 00:17:11.466
Now, from the ancient chasms of
a lost world I awake a great

00:17:11.466 --> 00:17:14.700
and terrible power...

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.933
I Synchro Summon...

00:17:17.933 --> 00:17:21.000
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:17:34.666 --> 00:17:36.900
Jack's not only shut down
Yuya's attack,

00:17:36.900 --> 00:17:40.133
but he's brought out his
most famous flaming monster!

00:17:40.133 --> 00:17:42.533
I really thought you would have
stepped up your game,

00:17:42.533 --> 00:17:44.966
but you're just as clueless
as you were last time

00:17:44.966 --> 00:17:45.966
I destroyed you.

00:17:45.966 --> 00:17:47.066
That's not true!

00:17:47.066 --> 00:17:50.066
I have stepped up
my game... (groans)

00:17:50.066 --> 00:17:51.566
(Yuya)
But if Xiangke Magician

00:17:51.566 --> 00:17:53.600
is the only card
left in my hand,

00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:56.500
there's nothing left
I can really do.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500
I guess I'll end my turn.

00:18:01.066 --> 00:18:03.233
Yuya's attack points
just got a flat tire.

00:18:03.233 --> 00:18:04.800
He needs some roadside
assistance!

00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.166
Yuya was all
smiles moments ago,

00:18:07.166 --> 00:18:09.466
but with Smile World's
effect gone

00:18:09.466 --> 00:18:12.666
Jack's done and brought
back the doom and gloom!

00:18:12.666 --> 00:18:14.966
Another setback...
Aw, man...

00:18:14.966 --> 00:18:17.000
(Jack)
What do you expect
when you keep relying

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:19.366
on your dad's
strategies?

00:18:19.366 --> 00:18:20.366
What?!

00:18:20.366 --> 00:18:23.533
And not on your own skills!

00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:26.700
Well, my dad's dueltaining

00:18:26.700 --> 00:18:29.466
was what made him
the greatest champion ever!

00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:32.000
And your just
a poor imitator.

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:35.366
Why not dueltain like only you
can instead of copying your dad?

00:18:35.366 --> 00:18:37.666
Be you, Yuya!

00:18:37.666 --> 00:18:40.033
Maybe he's right.

00:18:40.033 --> 00:18:41.766
I have to be me.

00:18:41.766 --> 00:18:43.066
(Roget laughing)

00:18:43.066 --> 00:18:45.100
This has been fun.

00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:47.933
I almost hate to see it end.

00:18:47.933 --> 00:18:50.166
But this is the end...

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:51.700
For both of you.

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:55.266
<i>Hubuh‐wha?</i>

00:18:55.266 --> 00:18:58.200
There's something blocking
the road ahead‐‐ Ah!

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:00.633
It's Sector Security
and they're looking

00:19:00.633 --> 00:19:03.166
to put the brakes
onthis here battle!

00:19:05.266 --> 00:19:08.166
But no one's gonna put
the brakes on Jack!

00:19:11.733 --> 00:19:14.966
(computer) Battle
Royal mode engaged!

00:19:14.966 --> 00:19:15.966
<i>Ah!</i>

00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:16.900
<i>Ten on two?</i>

00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:18.533
<i>That ain't fair!</i>

00:19:18.533 --> 00:19:21.000
(Jack)
So Roget wants to play.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.533
Well, I'm game.

00:19:22.533 --> 00:19:25.300
Jack and Yuya
made a fatal error.

00:19:25.300 --> 00:19:27.400
They ignored my authority.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.200
And anyone who makes
that mistake

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:31.333
must and will be punished!

00:19:31.333 --> 00:19:33.900
(Roget) Attention
Sector Security...

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:37.200
Run Jack and Yuya
off the road!

00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:39.200
Roger that.

00:19:39.200 --> 00:19:43.100
Goyo Emperor attack,
Performapal Radish Horse!

00:19:45.633 --> 00:19:47.900
(gasps, groans)

00:19:50.466 --> 00:19:53.066
I activate
the Action Card Evasion!

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.466
It dodged the attack!

00:19:54.466 --> 00:19:56.633
Well, I 'm not gonna miss!

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.166
(screams)

00:20:00.166 --> 00:20:01.866
Ah! No!

00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:05.800
(Jack)
I activate the trap
card Red Connection!

00:20:05.800 --> 00:20:08.366
Listen up you want
to be crossing guards.

00:20:08.366 --> 00:20:11.766
All of your monsters can no
longer attack, and all monsters

00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:14.366
lose 500 attack points!

00:20:20.233 --> 00:20:23.200
Now that I put Sector Security
on time out,

00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:25.500
let's get back
to our duel!

00:20:25.500 --> 00:20:28.500
It's my turn!

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.033
It seems that I expected
entirely too much

00:20:31.033 --> 00:20:32.333
from this duel.

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:35.966
I guess even I make mistakes
in judgment sometimes.

00:20:35.966 --> 00:20:41.066
And Roget, if you step on to my
track, prepare to get burned!

00:20:41.066 --> 00:20:45.033
I activate Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's special ability!

00:20:45.033 --> 00:20:47.266
It destroys all monsters,

00:20:47.266 --> 00:20:51.600
including yours Yuya!

00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:54.766
And then delivers 500 points
of damage for each one that

00:20:54.766 --> 00:20:57.133
perished by its flames.

00:20:57.133 --> 00:20:59.100
Feel the heat!

00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.033
(gasps)

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:10.833
(screaming)
