Did she say Gong?!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:15.833
Gong is here?

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:18.500

The Friendship Cup's
off to a rootin'‐tootin' start!

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.633
And all the
hootin‐n'‐hollerin' ya hear is
for Crow Hogan,

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:09.266
the winner of
our debut duel!

00:02:12.133 --> 00:02:14.000
Way to work
those cards, Crow!

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.466
You were rocktastic!

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.033
You'renumero uno!

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.533
I knew you'd soar
into the next round!

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.566
Crow dueled well
for a Common,

00:02:21.566 --> 00:02:24.866
and that Gong,
he certainly showed
some potential.

00:02:24.866 --> 00:02:27.666
Too bad potential
doesn't make
for a winner.

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:30.466
It would have been nice
to see him continue on.

00:02:30.466 --> 00:02:33.233
Seeing underdogs
overachieving is fun.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:36.700

like his physique.

He must feel terrible.

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:00.366
And now I can't even see him
to cheer him up

00:03:00.366 --> 00:03:03.733

ridiculous rules.

All of the sixteen
Friendship Cup participants

for the duration
of the tournament.

00:03:10.066 --> 00:03:12.600

However, you may only remain
in the lap of luxury

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.300
as long as you're
in the tournament.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.566

If you lose,
you will be removed at once.

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:20.166
Now that Gong's been knocked out
of the tournament,

00:03:20.166 --> 00:03:22.000
where's he gonna stay?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.200
Oh, no!

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.400
What if they send him
back to The Facility?!

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.566
I mean,
I already lost a duel too,

even if it was
just an exhibition match.

00:03:31.566 --> 00:03:33.600
Doesn't seem fair
that I get to stay here.

Huh?

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.366

Then again, maybe I won't be
sticking around for much longer!

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:42.266
'Cause it looks
like it's my turn to duel.

00:03:42.266 --> 00:03:44.233
What if I have to duel
one of the other Lancers?

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:47.866
(heartbeat thumping)
Or even worse... Zuzu.

00:03:47.866 --> 00:03:49.700
Either way...

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.066

to duel in the Friendship Cup.

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.566
I don't want to face
one of my friends.

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:04.133
But it looks
like I don't have any choice!

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:05.933

I wonder who it will be?

00:04:05.933 --> 00:04:08.900

Shh...!
Huh?

00:04:11.933 --> 00:04:13.166
Keep it down, Yuya.

00:04:13.166 --> 00:04:15.633
You're going to get both of us
in major trouble.

00:04:15.633 --> 00:04:17.400
How'd you get out?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.300
I thought
that we were all in lockdown.

Uh...

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.700
Hmm... on second thought...

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.566
are they really like noses?

00:04:29.566 --> 00:04:31.233
I mean, locks can't smell,

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:33.900
and we don't use noses
to protect our valuables...

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.566
Oh, yeah... that sure is
something to think about.

00:04:36.566 --> 00:04:37.800

C'mon, wrap it up!

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.666
Huh?
Huh?

These security guards

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.966
will be back from their lunch
before you know it‐‐

00:04:41.966 --> 00:04:43.500
they're all chew and no chat.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:46.166
And I'm not risking my tail
over one rare card.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:50.566
Huh? You're bribing people
with rare cards again?

00:04:50.566 --> 00:04:54.033
Shh! Why don't you just
broadcast it to the whole city?

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.600
Uh, you do realize that there
are security cameras

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.033
in all of our rooms, right?

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:01.966
What?!

00:05:01.966 --> 00:05:04.200

lock me up again,

they're more than welcome to‐‐

00:05:06.366 --> 00:05:09.000

Please go
back to your room!

I don't wanna become
a jailbird!

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:16.466
Well, maybe you should've
thought of that

00:05:16.466 --> 00:05:18.033
when you accepted
my rare card!

00:05:18.033 --> 00:05:20.333
A deal's a deal,
so deal with it!

00:05:20.333 --> 00:05:21.900
Now zip the lip!

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.166
Consider it zipped!

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:24.333
What's so urgent

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:26.166
that you had to
talk to me right now?

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.133
Because...

00:05:28.133 --> 00:05:31.133
I heard some news
that you needed to hear.

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:33.600
And it just couldn't wait?

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600
No, it's way too important.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.866
I overheard some workers
shooting the breeze

00:05:38.866 --> 00:05:41.433
outside my room earlier today...

00:05:41.433 --> 00:05:45.333
(man 1)
These duelists and their fancy
schmancy rooms make me sick!

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:48.600
Even if it is just temporary for
the tournament, it's not right!

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.666
(man 2)
Yeah! Crow and Shinji and
Chojiro are all from the slums!

00:05:52.666 --> 00:05:54.533
They're no better
than you or me,

00:05:54.533 --> 00:05:57.500
but now they're bein' treated
like VIP Topsiders!

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.233
(man 1)
Why should they get
special treatment?

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:00.900
I hope they all lose!

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.466
(Chojiro)
Listening to those halfwits
made me so furious,

00:06:03.466 --> 00:06:06.466
I was ready to give them
a piece of my mind,

00:06:06.466 --> 00:06:09.100
but just as I was
about to unleash my wrath...

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:10.900
(man 3)
Aah, don't get jealous.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.433
Don't you guys know
what happens to the duelists

00:06:12.433 --> 00:06:13.966
that lose their matches?

00:06:13.966 --> 00:06:15.333
(man 2)
Sure, I do.

00:06:15.333 --> 00:06:18.400
Once they lose, the duelists get
kicked outta their fancy digs.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.866
(man 3)
Nah, it's worse than that.

00:06:19.866 --> 00:06:23.066
The losers get hauled off
somewhere not very nice.

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:24.500
(man 2)
The Facility?

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:26.300

Nah, someplace way worse!

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.466

Seriously?

00:06:27.466 --> 00:06:28.766
(man 2)
Where do the take them?!

00:06:28.766 --> 00:06:31.733
Don't tell anybody
you heard this from me

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:36.100
They're sent underground to work
in a gigantic garbage dump‐‐

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.066
and I bet
it don't smell like roses!

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.900
They're forced

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.400
Are you serious, Chojiro?!

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.433
Yes. I'd always heard stories
about this place.

00:06:48.433 --> 00:06:49.766
I thought they were just rumors,

00:06:49.766 --> 00:06:53.433
but it sounds like there is
truth to these tales.

00:06:53.433 --> 00:06:55.200
Sector Security
only transports

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.866
special prisoners
to that site.

00:06:56.866 --> 00:06:58.266
What do you mean
"special"?

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:01.266
Escapees... and anyone else
who's a threat to their system.

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:02.366
Huh?!

00:07:02.366 --> 00:07:04.666
(Chojiro)
Whenever a prisoner gets caught

00:07:04.666 --> 00:07:06.366
planning or trying
to escape,

00:07:06.366 --> 00:07:08.166
his pals get punished, too.

00:07:08.166 --> 00:07:09.400
I didn't
do nothing!

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:10.466
(Chojiro)
The guards round them all up...

00:07:10.466 --> 00:07:12.033
drag them off...

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:15.066
and nobody ever sees them again.

00:07:15.066 --> 00:07:16.400
It gets worse.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.566
The prisoners are forced to work
until they drop.

00:07:18.566 --> 00:07:21.900
There's no mercy for the weak.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:24.866
Our knowledge is based solely
on whispers from below

00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:27.333
because no one has ever
returned from there.

00:07:27.333 --> 00:07:30.233
I'm not surprised
such a place exists

00:07:30.233 --> 00:07:33.700
because I've lived through
the history of this city.

00:07:33.700 --> 00:07:37.933
For a long time, our metropolis
has been constantly expanding...

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:40.733
but during the ten years
I was held in detention,

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:43.500
the growth spiraled
out of control.

00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:45.100
Tens of millions of people

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:48.366
are now crammed
into a relatively small area.

00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:52.600
The majority of the people in
this city dwell in the slums,

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:55.500
where the Commons live
in extreme poverty,

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:59.800
struggling from day to day
just to survive.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:03.266
The lucky few, however,
live as Topsiders.

00:08:03.266 --> 00:08:05.900
These people enjoy
a life of complete luxury

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.700
and flaunt their wealth
and status

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:12.466
without any thought for those
less fortunate than they are.

00:08:12.466 --> 00:08:14.600
As a result
of this wasteful lifestyle,

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.500
mountains of garbage constantly
piled up, blanketing our homes.

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.333
Our leaders couldn't
ignore the problem forever,

00:08:23.333 --> 00:08:26.900
which is why they constructed
the underground waste refinery.

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.700
Of course, the Topsiders
who created the problem

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.300
refuse to get
their hands dirty.

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.966
Instead, they've left
their mess

00:08:33.966 --> 00:08:35.833
for Commons
to take care of...

00:08:35.833 --> 00:08:38.600
while they continue
to live the life of luxury.

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.166
They use us and throw us away.

00:08:41.166 --> 00:08:43.833
To them,
our lives are no different

00:08:43.833 --> 00:08:46.433
than the garbage
they thoughtlessly discard.

00:08:46.433 --> 00:08:49.066
Right now, we live like kings.

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:53.033
But if we lose,
we are worse than peasants.

00:08:53.033 --> 00:08:54.666
Gong lost his duel.

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:57.800
Does that mean he was
sent to the refinery?

00:08:57.800 --> 00:08:59.833
I am afraid so.

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:00.766

Riley is as powerful

Naturally, the very idea
of entering into battle

00:13:34.666 --> 00:13:36.166

it's not worth it.

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.866
It's way too risky!

You can't expect a kid

00:13:56.066 --> 00:13:58.333

this lack of self‐awareness
