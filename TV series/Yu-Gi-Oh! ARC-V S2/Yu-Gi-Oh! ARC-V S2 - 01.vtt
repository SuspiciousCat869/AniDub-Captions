00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.666
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.666 --> 00:00:06.400
(Sora)
Dueling has
never been for fun,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.533
but I guess it was fun seeing
all those Xyzians run for cover.

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:12.800
You know what Duel Academy
did to the Xyz Dimension?

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.533
It wrecked
their world...

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.900
A world filled with
happiness and joy.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.566
Your buddies
took it all away!

00:00:19.566 --> 00:00:20.833
Stuff happens.

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:23.533
You can't make an omelet
without breaking a few eggs.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:27.100
Yuto, I'm having a hard time
trying to get Sora to understand

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.966
what dueling's
really about,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:33.466
but maybe together, by combining
our monsters, we can reach him!

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:34.900
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.266
Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon!

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:42.533
Time to swoop in and
take out Saber‐Tooth!

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.100
(both shouting)

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:47.633
(horn blowing)

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:49.700
(arena announcer)
Time's up!

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.700
The Battle Royal
is officially over!

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.633
(Gong)
Yuya! You all right?

00:00:54.633 --> 00:00:55.866
Huh?

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:57.000
(Yuya)
Hey, you found Zuzu!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
I'm not Zuzu.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:00:59.600
Huh?

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.500
Then where is she?

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.666
Don't tell me your friends
took her away!

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:05.733
Sora!

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:08.966
You've all dueled well.

00:01:08.966 --> 00:01:10.266
Declan!

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.666
I got rid of all the
Fusion Dimension dweebs

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:14.200
just like you
wanted me to.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.900
I therefore qualify
to join

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.933
the elite, exclusive ranks
of the Lancers.

00:01:18.933 --> 00:01:20.033
Who're they?

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.333
This Battle Royal
was really a test.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.800
A test to see who can
cut it as a Lancer.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.000
Lancer?

00:01:27.866 --> 00:01:31.033

(Yuya)
Hey, Declan!

00:02:31.566 --> 00:02:32.800
What's the deal?

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.533
We thought the Battle Royal
was the next stage

00:02:34.533 --> 00:02:35.966
of the
Championship,

00:02:35.966 --> 00:02:38.833
and now we find out it was
just some sorta lame tryout

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:40.400
to become
one of your Lancers?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.000
What are you
trying to pull?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.833
I am simply trying
to save our world, Yuya.

00:02:44.833 --> 00:02:47.766
Once I learned warriors
from the Fusion Dimension

00:02:47.766 --> 00:02:50.066
were planning
to infiltrate our home

00:02:50.066 --> 00:02:53.433
I needed a way to stand up to
them without causing a panic.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.633
The Battle Royal was
the perfect camouflage

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.500
for the real conflict
at hand.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.933
I sent the best duelists
the Leo Institute had to offer

00:03:00.933 --> 00:03:02.800
to drive
back the enemy.

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.500
Turns out, their best
wasn't good enough.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.266
But you and your friends,
however, have what it takes.

00:03:08.266 --> 00:03:10.533
So you used us?

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.333
(Declan)
I simply used the resources
available to me.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:17.100
By repulsing the Fusion Warriors
you proved your strength today.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.533
But defending our world
is not good enough.

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:22.366
We have to take the battle
to the Fusion Dimension.

00:03:22.366 --> 00:03:27.500
And you and your fellow Lancers
will lead that charge!

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.266
And end up
like our friends?

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:30.466
Turned into cards?

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.833
Reed and Trout, they didn't
deserve this!

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:33.833
Nobody did!

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.966
Don't you see that?

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:40.133
And Zuzu,
what about her? (sobs)

00:03:40.133 --> 00:03:42.533
What if they got
to Zuzu, too?

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:46.566
(sobbing)

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:49.433
She might be gone
forever!

00:03:49.433 --> 00:03:51.300
And it's your fault!

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.133
He isn't
to blame.

00:03:53.133 --> 00:03:54.733
Huh!

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:57.966
If anyone's responsible
for her fate, it's me.

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.333
So Zuzu's M‐I‐A
'cause of you?

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.066
Gong don't even know
who you are, lady!

00:04:03.066 --> 00:04:04.733
My name
is Selena.

00:04:04.733 --> 00:04:06.366
I'm from the
Fusion Dimension!

00:04:06.366 --> 00:04:07.700
Say what?

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.566
If you're from
the Fusion Dimension,

00:04:09.566 --> 00:04:11.500
then you're one
of our enemies!

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:12.966
(thinking)
Just fantastic!

00:04:12.966 --> 00:04:14.400
Now that the cat's
out of the bag

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.166
they'll never
let her out of their sights.

00:04:16.166 --> 00:04:18.966
Looks like me taking Selena back
to Duel Academy

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:21.033
isn't
in the cards.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:22.866
So there's a Fusion
freak among us!

00:04:22.866 --> 00:04:25.100
And dressed as Zuzu Boyle
no less!

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.200
Obviously she's
an enemy agent!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.433
Your disguise is uncanny, but
I saw through you immediately!

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:32.900
Now you better talk
or I'll‐‐

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.966
Step aside.

00:04:33.966 --> 00:04:35.466
I am interrogating
her!

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:37.433
Are you working
for Fusion, too?

00:04:37.433 --> 00:04:38.466
No.

00:04:38.466 --> 00:04:40.233
But I have made a promise
to protect her.

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:41.566
To who?

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:43.333
You better give me
a name, ninjaman!

00:04:43.333 --> 00:04:45.366
Or I'll‐‐
Selena is no spy.

00:04:45.366 --> 00:04:47.666
In fact, a squad of
Fusion Warriors was sent

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:49.033
to hunt her
down.

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:50.233
It's true.

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:52.233
These warriors are members
of Obelisk Force.

00:04:52.233 --> 00:04:53.800
They were
hot on my trail,

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:55.466
but since Zuzu and I
switched outfits,

00:04:55.466 --> 00:04:57.100
they probably thought
she was me.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.033
Wait, the two
of you switched duds?

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:01.766
Why would Zuzu agree
to do that?

00:05:01.766 --> 00:05:03.866
Because...

00:05:03.866 --> 00:05:06.266
She wanted to give me
the chance to meet Shay.

00:05:06.266 --> 00:05:07.966
Why?

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:11.166
(Selena)
Zuzu told me how Duel Academy
had attacked innocent Xyzians,

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:12.766
but I didn't believe her.

00:05:12.766 --> 00:05:15.500
She wanted me to find Shay
and hear the story from him.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.100
So she offered
to be my decoy,

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.100
to keep Obelisk Force
off of my tail.

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:22.933
Then Zuzu's...
(crying)

00:05:25.266 --> 00:05:28.266
If you don't want to lose
any more friends like Zuzu,

00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:30.166
then it's best
you join my Lancers

00:05:30.166 --> 00:05:32.166
and take the fight
to them.

00:05:32.166 --> 00:05:36.866
This task will require all the
strength and determination
you can muster!

00:05:36.866 --> 00:05:38.466
You can avenge them.

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.466
I will provide
the opportunity.

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:43.366
All you must do is follow
my lead and trust me.

00:05:43.366 --> 00:05:45.300
You're asking us
to trust you?

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:46.633
After all your lies?

00:05:46.633 --> 00:05:50.800
I don't care about your battle,
all I want are my friends back!

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.033
All of them!

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:53.866
Bring them back!

00:05:57.033 --> 00:06:02.100
A duelist settles his issues
with a duel, not his fists.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:03.900
All right, then!

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.166
If that's how you want it,
I'll duel you,

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.233
for dragging us
all into this fight!

00:06:08.233 --> 00:06:09.800
Very well,
then.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.533
If you should defeat me,

00:06:11.533 --> 00:06:15.600
I will accept any punishment
you see fit for my misdeeds.

00:06:23.166 --> 00:06:25.500
What is
Declan up to?

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:26.566
Oh!

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:28.266
You do not yet understand

00:06:28.266 --> 00:06:30.233
the gravity of the threat
to this world.

00:06:30.233 --> 00:06:32.300
Establishing the Lancers
was the only way

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.133
to stop another
tragedy.

00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:36.466
I will not allow the people
of this dimension

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:39.500
to suffer the same fate
as the Xyzians!

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.333
I'll show you what I mean!

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:46.566
By activating the Action Field
Neo Heartland City!

00:06:46.566 --> 00:06:49.900
(computer voice)
Augmented reality
combat system energized.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:52.133
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:06:54.933 --> 00:06:56.200
(snarling)

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:59.333
Heartland City is located
in the Xyz Dimension.

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:00.866
(Shay)
Or it was.

00:07:00.866 --> 00:07:04.233
It's nothing more
than a ruined shell now.

00:07:05.966 --> 00:07:07.866
Because of you
Fusionites!

00:07:07.866 --> 00:07:09.033
Keep going, Shay.

00:07:09.033 --> 00:07:11.400
Tell Selena
the full story.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:16.366
(stifling tears)

00:07:16.366 --> 00:07:19.566
I guess it's too difficult
to relive a tragedy.

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:22.900
Fine, I will fill in
the details.

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.833
The Xyzians
were peaceful.

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:27.233
Yet were completely
helpless and unprepared

00:07:27.233 --> 00:07:29.233
to stop Duel Academy's
invasion.

00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:30.800
That's why
we must fight them.

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:32.033
(Yuya)
Enough!

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:35.466
I'm through hearing you talk.
Got it?

00:07:35.466 --> 00:07:38.966
I'm simply informing Selena of
the travesties that took place.

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:40.266
I said enough!

00:07:40.266 --> 00:07:42.800
Not talking about it isn't
going to change the fact

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.066
that you and your friends
will have to fight them.

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:46.633
Declan...

00:07:46.633 --> 00:07:48.700
I'm ending this now!

00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:52.466
Everything that happened to
my friends is all your fault!

00:07:52.466 --> 00:07:56.600
You set us up, and now,
I'm gonna take you down!

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:02.800
If you're so eager
to go into battle,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:04.833
then take me on
right now!

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:06.300
Let's duel!

00:08:07.366 --> 00:08:09.933
I'll use Scale 4
Performapal Trump Witch

00:08:09.933 --> 00:08:12.100
and Scale 8
Xiangsheng Magician

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.800
to set
the Pendulum Scale!

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.333
I'm taking control of
this duel, starting now!

00:08:25.766 --> 00:08:27.466
Swing far Pendulum!

00:08:27.466 --> 00:08:29.833
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:35.166
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:08:37.566 --> 00:08:40.433
Wield your wizardry,
Stargazer Magician!

00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:44.000
Splash to it, Performapal
Splashmammoth!

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.233
Pendulum Summoning
already?

00:08:46.233 --> 00:08:48.833
Yuya really does
mean business!

00:08:48.833 --> 00:08:51.533
With that,
I end my turn.

00:08:51.533 --> 00:08:53.333
Why would Zuzu
risk her own life

00:08:53.333 --> 00:08:56.733
just so that you
could talk to me?

00:08:57.933 --> 00:08:59.666
It's my turn.

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:01.966
I draw.

00:09:01.966 --> 00:09:05.100
Using the special ability
of my D/D Swirl Slime,

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:06.533
I will fuse it&amp;

00:09:06.533 --> 00:09:09.066
with my D/D Berfomet.

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:13.500
Your powers have grown to be
quite impressive,

00:09:13.500 --> 00:09:16.800
but as you will see, I am
more than capable of warding off

00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:19.533
any threat you send
my way, Yuya!

00:09:19.533 --> 00:09:21.400
I Fusion Summon!

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:25.000
D/D/D
Flame King Genghis!

00:09:26.733 --> 00:09:28.400
This is starting
to heat up!

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:30.533
If this is anything
like their last duel,

00:09:30.533 --> 00:09:33.133
we're in for
quite the show!

00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:34.400
Really?

00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.966
I didn't realize he and
Yuya had dueled before!

00:09:36.966 --> 00:09:38.100
Yeah.

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:39.366
Back
at You Show.

00:09:39.366 --> 00:09:41.233
Who won
the duel?

00:09:41.233 --> 00:09:45.133
We never got to find out, on
account of Declan running out.

00:09:45.133 --> 00:09:48.033
But Gong's not sure
Yuya would've won.

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:51.166
I think I'll add a little
variety to the field
by summoning...

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:53.233
D/D Nighthowl!

00:09:54.033 --> 00:09:55.500
(roaring)

00:09:56.833 --> 00:09:58.633
Whoa, that's a
Tuner Monster?

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:00.033
That's right.

00:10:00.033 --> 00:10:03.366
Declan's mastered a slew o'
different summoning methods!

00:10:03.366 --> 00:10:06.033
Once I've successfully
summoned Nighthowl,

00:10:06.033 --> 00:10:08.500
I'm allowed to summon another
D/D monster

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.433
straight from
my graveyard,

00:10:10.433 --> 00:10:13.400
by lowering
its attack points to zero!

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.733
I bring back
D/D Berfomet!

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:24.333
I tune Level 3 D/D Nighthowl
with my Level 4 D/D Berfomet!

00:10:29.266 --> 00:10:30.400
Observe!

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:33.233
Such is the power
we shall wield together

00:10:33.233 --> 00:10:36.866
when we defy and defeat
the forces of Duel Academy!

00:10:36.866 --> 00:10:38.733
I Synchro Summon!

00:10:38.733 --> 00:10:42.166
D/D/D Gust King Alexander!

00:10:45.466 --> 00:10:46.733
Impressive.

00:10:46.733 --> 00:10:49.300
He certainly knows how
to keep you on your toes.

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:51.433
When I summon another D/D/D
monster

00:10:51.433 --> 00:10:53.433
such as
Gust King Alexander,

00:10:53.433 --> 00:10:57.933
Flame King Genghis resurrects
a D/D monster from my graveyard.

00:10:57.933 --> 00:11:01.233
Arise once again,
D/D Swirl Slime!

00:11:01.233 --> 00:11:02.800
And as
a further twist,

00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:06.500
D/D/D Gust King Alexander's
special ability activates!

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:08.466
Whenever a D/D monster
is summoned,

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:11.100
my Gust King can
command another D/D monster

00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:14.533
to rise from the graveyard‐‐
as it will now!

00:11:14.533 --> 00:11:18.133
D/D Berfomet, return
to the field of battle!

00:11:19.333 --> 00:11:22.133
Berfomet's special ability
now activates!

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:24.800
Doubling the Level
of my Swirl Slime to four!

00:11:27.666 --> 00:11:30.733
And with that, I take my Swirl
Slime and Berfomet...

00:11:30.733 --> 00:11:33.966
and build
the Overlay Network!

00:11:36.466 --> 00:11:37.800
Oh!

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:41.266
Prepare to face a trio
of sovereign warriors,

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:44.166
because there's a third
king on the way!

00:11:44.166 --> 00:11:46.433
I Xyz Summon!

00:11:46.433 --> 00:11:49.900
D/D/D
Wave King Caesar!

00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.833
I can't
believe my eyes...

00:11:55.833 --> 00:11:58.466
Why, this is unprecedented!

00:11:58.466 --> 00:12:02.300
Sounds like you need to get your
nose out of your textbooks,
Mr. MacField!

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.866
I thought everybody
at Leo knew

00:12:03.866 --> 00:12:07.100
Declan Akaba had
mastered the big three.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.766
So it's common
knowledge?

00:12:08.766 --> 00:12:11.466
Well, there's really nothing
common about it, now is there?

00:12:11.466 --> 00:12:14.133
You forgot one!

00:12:14.133 --> 00:12:16.733
Declan knows how
to Pendulum Summon, too.

00:12:16.733 --> 00:12:17.766
Unbelievable!

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:19.366
He knows
four methods?

00:12:19.366 --> 00:12:21.100
And I'm sure he wants
to test them all out

00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:25.833
against
Duel Academy!

00:12:25.833 --> 00:12:28.233
So you traveled to this
dimension to challenge me.

00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:29.166
Didn't you?

00:12:29.166 --> 00:12:30.733
I did.

00:12:30.733 --> 00:12:33.466
My goal was to track down
fugitives from Xyz.

00:12:33.466 --> 00:12:36.233
By taking them down, I'd
show what I was capable of.

00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:39.666
The Professor would see
his mistake then.

00:12:39.666 --> 00:12:42.633
And he'd have to let me join
Obelisk Force.

00:12:42.633 --> 00:12:44.300
I believed
in the Professor's vision

00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.633
of uniting all four
dimensions.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:48.433
But after
what Zuzu told me,

00:12:48.433 --> 00:12:51.433
I'm beginning to have
serious doubts.

00:12:51.433 --> 00:12:55.700
You see, she said that Obelisk
Force had attacked all Xyzians,

00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:58.400
including those
who weren't duelists.

00:12:58.400 --> 00:12:59.866
I found it hard
to believe

00:12:59.866 --> 00:13:02.733
Obelisk Force could do
anything so terrible.

00:13:02.733 --> 00:13:04.500
Is what she
told me true?

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.200
Or was Zuzu filling
my head with lies?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:09.100
All of it's true.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.966
Your Obelisk Force was
merciless.

00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:14.833
They chased down
everyone in their path

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.066
whether they were
a duelist or not.

00:13:17.066 --> 00:13:18.400
Gust King!

00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:21.033
Focus your fury
on Stargazer Magician

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:23.400
and blow him off
the field!

00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.866
Wave King Caesar will be
next to strike.

00:13:37.866 --> 00:13:41.900
Send Splashmammoth into
extinction with Tidal Torrent!

00:13:50.233 --> 00:13:53.966
Yuya, you picked a battle
you could never win!

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:57.433
Now feel the full force
of Flame King's ferocity!

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:06.100
Aaah!
Uhn! Uhn!

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.300
(people shouting in fear)

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.866
(laughing)

00:14:23.233 --> 00:14:26.033
I can still hear
the attackers laughing,

00:14:26.033 --> 00:14:29.566
and the screams of those
desperately trying to escape.

00:14:29.566 --> 00:14:32.766
Their voices will remain seared
in my memory forever!

00:14:32.766 --> 00:14:34.300
Declan is
flawless.

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:37.533
Each one of his attacks
has left Yuya defenseless.

00:14:37.533 --> 00:14:40.400
This duel is a complete mismatch
on every level.

00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.766
I place one card facedown
and end my turn!

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.566
Of course,
I know that nothing

00:14:46.566 --> 00:14:49.466
I have done so far has been
a surprise to you.

00:14:49.466 --> 00:14:51.533
I know exactly
what you're thinking,

00:14:51.533 --> 00:14:53.700
that you still have
a chance to come back.

00:14:53.700 --> 00:14:55.333
(Yuya grunts)

00:14:55.333 --> 00:14:58.733
You've learned how to maximize
your Pendulum powers.

00:14:58.733 --> 00:15:01.900
Yuya... I encourage you
to use them against me.

00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:05.866
It's the only chance
you have of winning.

00:15:05.866 --> 00:15:07.333
When it comes
to dueling,

00:15:07.333 --> 00:15:09.566
you don't miss a beat,
do you, Declan?

00:15:09.566 --> 00:15:12.233
No wonder everyone
thinks you're a genius.

00:15:12.233 --> 00:15:14.433
I bet you also knew
exactly what would happen

00:15:14.433 --> 00:15:16.500
in the Battle
Royal, too!

00:15:16.500 --> 00:15:19.566
Like how many would be lost and
how many'd make it through!

00:15:19.566 --> 00:15:22.700
It turned out just like
you predicted, didn't it?

00:15:24.933 --> 00:15:28.100
We're nothing but puppets
to you, aren't we?

00:15:30.066 --> 00:15:32.066
But I have news for you.

00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:34.933
You're not gonna be
pullin' any strings...

00:15:34.933 --> 00:15:37.700
not after I get through
with you!

00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:40.733
Someone has to
take you down a notch, Declan.

00:15:40.733 --> 00:15:43.066
And that someone
is me!

00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:49.600
It's time for this duel
to swing my way again, Declan!

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:51.633
It's showtime!

00:15:57.333 --> 00:15:59.333
I'm bringing back
Stargazer Magician

00:15:59.333 --> 00:16:02.300
and Performapal
Splashmammoth!

00:16:02.300 --> 00:16:04.200
But I'm not stopping there!

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.733
Come on out,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:09.033
(roaring)

00:16:09.033 --> 00:16:12.766
Splashmammoth, it's time for you
to splash on to the scene

00:16:12.766 --> 00:16:16.700
and add some bubbles to this
battle by activating your
special ability,

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:19.700
so I can Fusion Summon
without Polymerization!

00:16:20.533 --> 00:16:21.633
All right!

00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:24.366
Now I'll fuse Performapal
Splashmammoth...

00:16:24.366 --> 00:16:26.833
with Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:26.833 --> 00:16:28.833
By fusing
the fierceness of my Dragon

00:16:28.833 --> 00:16:30.566
with the ancient might
of my Mammoth,

00:16:30.566 --> 00:16:34.300
I'll create a new,
more powerful monster!

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:36.566
I Fusion Summon!

00:16:36.566 --> 00:16:39.633
Beast‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:42.566 --> 00:16:44.366
(roaring)

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:45.833
Rock on!

00:16:45.833 --> 00:16:47.266
That dragon
was so powerful

00:16:47.266 --> 00:16:49.533
that it even took Gong down
in a duel before,

00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:51.733
so it's
gonna destroy Declan!

00:16:51.733 --> 00:16:55.466
I activate Stargazer Magician's
special ability!

00:16:55.466 --> 00:16:57.500
Now I can bring back one
of the monsters I used

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.200
to summon
Beast‐Eyes!

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:04.966
Welcome back,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:04.966 --> 00:17:09.366
Now I activate Performapal Trump
Witch's Pendulum ability!

00:17:09.366 --> 00:17:12.700
Like Splashmammoth, she also
lets me Fusion Summon a monster

00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:16.366
without using
Polymerization!

00:17:16.366 --> 00:17:18.900
She'll give a little hocus
to my Odd‐Eyes,

00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:22.666
and then lend a dash
of pocus to Stargazer Magician!

00:17:22.666 --> 00:17:26.966
I'm fusing Stargazer Magician
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:33.166
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:33.166 --> 00:17:35.666
Rune‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:40.666 --> 00:17:42.466
(roaring)

00:17:46.366 --> 00:17:48.700
(roaring)

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.733
Beast‐Eyes and Rune‐Eyes
are more than allies,

00:17:50.733 --> 00:17:52.166
They're my friends!

00:17:52.166 --> 00:17:54.233
And I wouldn't have discovered
how to summon either of them

00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:56.933
if it hadn't been
for Zuzu!

00:17:56.933 --> 00:18:00.666
'Cause Zuzu learned how to
Fusion Summon from Sora.

00:18:00.666 --> 00:18:01.900
Training?

00:18:01.900 --> 00:18:03.166
You and
Zuzu?

00:18:03.166 --> 00:18:04.233
Yeah!

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:07.700
Zuzu asked me
to help her with‐‐

00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:10.133
Wait, is it supposed
to be a secret

00:18:10.133 --> 00:18:12.833
that you wanted me to teach
you Fusion Summoning?

00:18:12.833 --> 00:18:14.233
Fusion
Summoning?

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.066
She studied
under Sora?

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:21.500
Interesting.

00:18:21.500 --> 00:18:24.066
I didn't realize she had
studied Fusion Summoning

00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:26.566
from a student
of Duel Academy.

00:18:26.566 --> 00:18:29.533
So you knew all along that
Sora came from Duel Academy?

00:18:29.533 --> 00:18:31.200
Of course.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.300
His Fusion Summoning powers
went far beyond those

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:37.166
of the other students
at the Leo Institute.

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:39.933
I'm finally beginning
to understand.

00:18:39.933 --> 00:18:42.966
Zuzu and Sora opened your eyes
to the world of Fusion Summoning

00:18:42.966 --> 00:18:46.300
which led to you taking Pendulum
Summoning to the next level.

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:47.666
Yeah, 'cause that's
what friends do,

00:18:47.666 --> 00:18:49.866
no matter where
they're from.

00:18:49.866 --> 00:18:51.266
We help each other,

00:18:51.266 --> 00:18:53.633
and together, we're
gonna take you down.

00:18:53.633 --> 00:18:55.600
It's curtains
for you, Declan!

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.400
I look forward
to seeing you try!

00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:01.400
Since I used Stargazer
Magician to form Rune‐Eyes,

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.633
it can attack
three times!

00:19:03.633 --> 00:19:04.766
(roaring)

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:08.366
Let's do this,
Rune‐Eyes!

00:19:08.366 --> 00:19:09.766
Power up!

00:19:09.766 --> 00:19:11.233
And take out
his Kings!

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.966
Go,
Triple Spiral Skyshot!

00:19:30.766 --> 00:19:32.500
Your sister?

00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.900
Obelisk Force
really took Lulu away?

00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:36.666
Yes, they did.

00:19:36.666 --> 00:19:38.233
And it hurts to look
at you

00:19:38.233 --> 00:19:40.433
because you look
exactly like her.

00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:41.566
Huh.

00:19:41.566 --> 00:19:43.333
Okay!

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:45.400
Go, Beast‐Eyes!

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:47.633
Blazing
Spiral Storm!

00:19:47.633 --> 00:19:50.433
There's no way Declan's
packing near enough life points

00:19:50.433 --> 00:19:53.200
to survive a direct attack
from old Beast‐Eyes!

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.800
He's finished!

00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:56.200
(gasping)

00:20:09.466 --> 00:20:11.766
Oh!
What gives?

00:20:11.766 --> 00:20:13.900
I kept myself
from feeling the burn

00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.300
by activating my trap card
D/D/D Contract Change!

00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:18.400
Huh!

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.100
By banishing the D/D/D
monster in my graveyard

00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.733
with the most
attack points,

00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:25.966
I took no damage from your
Beast‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:20:31.333 --> 00:20:32.933
I was so close.

00:20:32.933 --> 00:20:34.333
That's not all.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:38.300
I add a D/D Pendulum Monster to
my hand that's Level 4 or below.

00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:40.100
Your strategy
has failed.

00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.933
True, your desire
to get revenge for Zuzu

00:20:42.933 --> 00:20:46.433
may have gotten you
this far, but not far enough.

00:20:46.433 --> 00:20:49.533
A duelist cannot win on
passion and emotions alone.

00:20:49.533 --> 00:20:51.533
But if you believe
you're strong enough

00:20:51.533 --> 00:20:55.000
to defeat a master duelist,
you're sadly mistaken.

00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.266
Battling Obelisk Force
is no game.

00:20:57.266 --> 00:20:59.166
They are ferocious
adversaries.

00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:01.400
But I know you and your
friends have what it takes

00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:03.100
to go deck to deck
with them.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.466
I'll never join
your Lancers!

00:21:05.466 --> 00:21:06.600
Oh?

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:09.000
Not even to save your
dear friend Zuzu?

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.566
Wha‐‐ ?

00:21:10.566 --> 00:21:11.733
Save her?

00:21:11.733 --> 00:21:13.466
Are you
telling me...

00:21:13.466 --> 00:21:15.933
We can get Zuzu back?

00:21:15.933 --> 00:21:19.300
Then Obelisk Force must
have taken her prisoner!

00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:21.566
Did you see them
carry Zuzu off?

00:21:21.566 --> 00:21:22.600
Huh?!

00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.066
(thinking)
If Declan saw Yuri capture Zuzu,

00:21:25.066 --> 00:21:27.133
he might put two and two
together,

00:21:27.133 --> 00:21:29.133
which would blow
my cover big‐time!

00:21:29.133 --> 00:21:31.366
You want to save
Zuzu?

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:33.800
Well, let's see
if that's even possible.

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.100
Let's see if you have what it
takes to defeat me first.
