00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.166
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V."

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.233
(crowd cheering)

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:09.833
(man, on P. A.)You can cut the
tension in this duel arena with
a knife!

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:12.500
Or better yet, with a pair
of scissors!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.200
Is Dennis gonna cut Shay's
life points down to
confetti?

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.966
Or does Shay
have one more way

00:00:16.966 --> 00:00:20.433
to sashay his way
out of danger?

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.900
(second man, on P. A.)
<i>This is Sector Security.</i>

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.366
You're all being detained for
taking part

00:00:24.366 --> 00:00:26.033
in underground
turbo duels.

00:00:26.033 --> 00:00:30.533
Do not resist or you will be
severely punished.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.000
Good news, sir.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.666
We have all the hooligans
involved

00:00:33.666 --> 00:00:36.100
in the underground Turbo
duels in custody,

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.233
including the two riders
and their friend

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.800
<i>that you had your eye on.</i>

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.866
There's more work to be done.

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.200
These three duelists

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.900
aren't the only ones on
my "most wanted" list,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.866
and I want them all
apprehended.

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:51.000
Sector Security
is heading this way!

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.266
Run for it!

00:00:52.266 --> 00:00:53.533
They must've
followed us here.

00:00:55.633 --> 00:00:57.833
Get down!

00:00:57.833 --> 00:00:59.433
Let me go!

00:01:03.866 --> 00:01:05.500
Oh!

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.233
Huh? Riley?

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:08.566
(whimpering)

00:01:08.566 --> 00:01:10.433
Leave the kids alone,
you big bully!

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:11.766

Yeah, my latest
arrest.

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:21.633
Uhh!

00:02:21.633 --> 00:02:24.400
Hey! If that was supposed
to hurt, it didn't!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.166
Aah!

00:02:28.666 --> 00:02:30.700
But that did.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.466
(guard) Don't think we forgot
about you two.

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:34.400
Go on, get in there! Move!

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:38.633
Wait!

00:02:38.633 --> 00:02:40.633
Tell me, where's Riley?

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:42.000
Get back, you punk!

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.700
Tell me, where's Riley?

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.500
I said get back!

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.700
(all)
Oh, no!

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.300
Behave or you're next!

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.166
Be cool!

00:02:51.166 --> 00:02:53.900
I'll find you guys when we get
out of this mess!

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.666
(all)
No! Don't take him!

00:02:56.666 --> 00:02:57.966
You big jerks!

00:02:57.966 --> 00:02:59.866
You took our friends away!

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:01.000
It no fair!

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:04.866
Hey!
I know you can hear me!

00:03:04.866 --> 00:03:06.500
I want some answers!

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.833
Chill, Yuya.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:11.000
How am I supposed to chill?
Riley's in danger.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.100
Wrong, Yuya.
Riley's in good hands.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.833
The kid's safe.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:18.800
Moon Shadow swooped in when
security showed up.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.033
Moon Shadow?
He was there?

00:03:21.033 --> 00:03:23.400
(Celina)
And just like that, he wasn't.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.666
So Riley's safe.
Thank goodness.

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:27.633
So who's this
Moon Shadow guy?

00:03:27.633 --> 00:03:29.433
Someone you know from
your dimension?

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:31.833
Yeah. He must have been
hanging out in the trees

00:03:31.833 --> 00:03:33.500
when he saw
the heat closing in.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.966
Declan probably sent him out
to find Riley.

00:03:35.966 --> 00:03:37.166
For sure.

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.566
Anyway, at least he got
spared the paddy wagon.

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:41.000
It's not so bad.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.533
Only wimps can't
handle it here.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:43.966
Hello!

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:46.100
Let me out! I really can't
handle it in here!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:48.100
I'm begging you!
I'll do anything!

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.000
Want me to dance a jig?
No problem.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.266
I'll dance a jig!

00:03:51.266 --> 00:03:53.233
You're not helping,
Sylvio.

00:03:53.233 --> 00:03:54.933
I'm sorry, old pal.

00:03:54.933 --> 00:03:57.200
Wish you hadn't got caught up
in all of this.

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.600
Don't sweat it.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.166
We've been through worse
together.

00:04:00.166 --> 00:04:02.766
We'll figure out a way to make
it through this as well.

00:04:02.766 --> 00:04:04.200
Hope you're right.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.033
'Cause without us, the kids
will be all on their own.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:08.200
Chin up, Crow.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.700
They've got each other
to count on.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.633
Yeah.

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:12.266
So, uh,

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:14.666
you guys have any idea of
where they're taking us?

00:04:14.666 --> 00:04:15.833
Yep.

00:04:15.833 --> 00:04:18.066
This is a Sector Security
transport.

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:20.200
That means we're going
to just one place,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.266
and it's no playground.

00:04:22.266 --> 00:04:25.200
Say hello to the Facility.

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.753
♪

00:04:40.127 --> 00:04:43.693
Five people that were detained
will be arriving there shortly.

00:04:43.693 --> 00:04:46.093
One of them
I want you to separate

00:04:46.093 --> 00:04:48.860
from the others for a special
interrogation.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.327
Something about her piques my
curiosity.

00:04:52.327 --> 00:04:56.127
Then again, they all do, so keep
the others on a short leash.

00:04:56.127 --> 00:04:58.893
Definitely separate from the
other inmates.

00:04:58.893 --> 00:05:01.927
<i>Consider it done, sir.</i>

00:05:01.927 --> 00:05:03.727
It's taken some doing,

00:05:03.727 --> 00:05:06.660
but at last,
they are mine.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:07.860
All right!

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.127
New high score,
here I come!

00:05:10.127 --> 00:05:13.093
Hey, just heard it
from the boss man.

00:05:13.093 --> 00:05:14.693
We got five new
prisoners coming in.

00:05:14.693 --> 00:05:17.660
We already have an officer
assigned to one of 'em,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.960
but he wants you to handle
the other four.

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:22.160
He doesn't want them
in general population.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.793
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

00:05:23.793 --> 00:05:25.627
Repeat it!
Look, I got it!

00:05:25.627 --> 00:05:27.060
No gen whatever...

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.093
I mean, how badly do you think
I can mess this up?

00:05:34.893 --> 00:05:37.260
I'm here to transfer
five prisoners.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.293
Proceed.

00:05:38.293 --> 00:05:40.093
Prisoner?
Did you say prisoner?

00:05:40.093 --> 00:05:41.627
I'm not a prisoner,
my name is‐‐

00:05:41.627 --> 00:05:43.760
You don't have a name,
you're just a number.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.893
Uhh.

00:05:44.893 --> 00:05:46.960
I have special orders
for the girl,

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.460
so say goodbye to
your friends, missy.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:49.460
You're coming with me.

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.193
Huh?
Don't worry.

00:05:51.193 --> 00:05:53.727
I'm gonna be fine.

00:05:53.727 --> 00:05:55.893
You other four, follow me.

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:01.093
There's no unauthorized
dueling in here,

00:06:01.093 --> 00:06:03.060
so we've confiscated
your duel disks.

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:05.593
Here are you decks.

00:06:05.593 --> 00:06:07.927
I thought you said
there was no dueling.

00:06:07.927 --> 00:06:11.393
You'll come to realize that your
cards have other uses.

00:06:11.393 --> 00:06:13.993
So I'd take care of them
if I were you.

00:06:13.993 --> 00:06:17.827
Now then, welcome to your
new home sweet home.

00:06:22.127 --> 00:06:24.860
(Sylvio)
They're tossing us in with
everyone else?

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.827
This is different than my normal
five‐star accommodations.

00:06:28.827 --> 00:06:30.093
Believe it or not,

00:06:30.093 --> 00:06:31.827
half the people locked up in
this place

00:06:31.827 --> 00:06:33.727
don't deserve to be here.

00:06:33.727 --> 00:06:34.827
They were rounded up
and arrested

00:06:34.827 --> 00:06:37.027
because of their
ideas and beliefs.

00:06:37.027 --> 00:06:39.393
Yeah, beliefs that
don't mesh so well

00:06:39.393 --> 00:06:41.093
with the current people
in charge.

00:06:41.093 --> 00:06:43.560
So, like us,
these people are innocent.

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:44.960
Right.

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:47.727
But still, being locked up
can take its toll on you.

00:06:47.727 --> 00:06:49.160
What do you mean?

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:52.393
Well, even the innocent have
their breaking point.

00:06:52.393 --> 00:06:54.860
We'll have to try
and stay strong,

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:57.560
just like some of
these lifers here.

00:07:01.027 --> 00:07:03.627
(buzzing)

00:07:03.627 --> 00:07:05.960
All right,
dredges of humanity.

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.460
This is where I leave you,
but don't worry,

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.227
I'm sure you'll make
plenty of new friends
down here in gen pop.

00:07:12.227 --> 00:07:13.393
(chuckles)

00:07:13.393 --> 00:07:16.393
Thanks. It's so nice
to know that you care.

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:19.593
Uh, hold it.

00:07:19.593 --> 00:07:22.193
Wasn't I supposed to do
something with them?

00:07:22.193 --> 00:07:23.360
Ehh, I forget.

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:25.560
Well, it's just us now.

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.560
Oh.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.927
And them.

00:07:27.927 --> 00:07:29.960
Hey, new guys.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.293
Huh?

00:07:31.293 --> 00:07:34.560
Ain't you gonna
come say hi?

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.127
(whimpers)
Yeah, we were
just about to.

00:07:37.127 --> 00:07:38.927
Too late. you've hurt
my feelings.

00:07:38.927 --> 00:07:41.393
And when you hurt his feelings
your hurt my feelings.

00:07:41.393 --> 00:07:43.393
And do you have any idea
what that means?

00:07:43.393 --> 00:07:46.427
Uh, that you guys are
a bit too sensitive?

00:07:46.427 --> 00:07:49.827
No, Yuya, what it means is
that they're gonna hurtyou.

00:07:49.827 --> 00:07:51.327
Good idea!

00:07:51.327 --> 00:07:52.960
You mean great idea!

00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.660
Gong says leave
those four alone!

00:07:56.693 --> 00:07:58.327
No way!
For real?

00:07:58.327 --> 00:08:00.293
Gong, is that‐‐

00:08:00.293 --> 00:08:02.460
Yuya, so good to see you!

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:04.593
You, too.
Super close up.

00:08:04.593 --> 00:08:06.693
Gong's been worried
sick about you!

00:08:06.693 --> 00:08:08.793
But now you're safe
in Gong's arms!

00:08:08.793 --> 00:08:10.193
And Gong's overjoyed!

00:08:10.193 --> 00:08:12.327
Uh‐oh. Hope you brought
a life jacket

00:08:12.327 --> 00:08:14.093
'cause here come
the waterworks!

00:08:14.093 --> 00:08:17.060
I guess any friend of Yuya's
is a friend of ours.

00:08:17.060 --> 00:08:19.693
I suppose that would
include me, then.

00:08:19.693 --> 00:08:22.393
After all, we're friends,
right, Yuya?

00:08:22.393 --> 00:08:24.593
Yes it's me, Dennis.

00:08:24.593 --> 00:08:27.293
Dennis! I didn't expect to
find you here.

00:08:27.293 --> 00:08:29.127
(sighs)
Neither did I,

00:08:29.127 --> 00:08:30.493
but they brought Shay and I in

00:08:30.493 --> 00:08:31.993
for being in an
underground duel.

00:08:31.993 --> 00:08:33.760
Shay's locked up here, too?

00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:35.693
Mm‐hmm.
But he got into some trouble.

00:08:35.693 --> 00:08:37.160
Trouble?

00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:40.327
A dozen inmates decided to give
him a not‐so‐welcome party.

00:08:40.327 --> 00:08:42.760
Shay decided to give 'em
a not‐so‐nice thank you

00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.160
and got placed in isolation.

00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:46.160
Wait, so, Gong,
you're telling us

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:48.027
that you know
who these people are?

00:08:48.027 --> 00:08:49.927
Yes. And had
you harmed them,

00:08:49.927 --> 00:08:51.860
Gong would've eaten your
meals for a week.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.493
Ah!

00:08:53.493 --> 00:08:56.027
But feel free to fill up
on Sylvio's meals.

00:08:56.027 --> 00:08:57.027
Hmm?

00:08:57.027 --> 00:08:59.493
Gong, accept our apology!

00:08:59.493 --> 00:09:00.727
We meant no harm!

00:09:00.727 --> 00:09:03.460
(both)
We're sorry! We're sorry!

00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:06.727
(Sylvio)
Well, Gong, you've certainly
got them well‐trained.

00:09:06.727 --> 00:09:08.760
Where's the rest of the crew,
Yuya?

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.660
How's the little one doing?
Any leads on Zuzu?

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:14.493
Riley's safe and sound
thanks to Moon Shadow

00:09:14.493 --> 00:09:16.160
showing up in
the nick of time.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.093
Now, about Zuzu...

00:09:18.093 --> 00:09:20.293
What? Please tell Gong you
found her!

00:09:20.293 --> 00:09:22.227
Not yet, but...

00:09:22.227 --> 00:09:25.327
I definitely know that she's
somewhere in this city.

00:09:25.327 --> 00:09:28.160
I have to bust out of here
so I can find her!

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:30.327
So, Gong,
how do we bust out?

00:09:30.327 --> 00:09:31.793
What's the plan here?

00:09:31.793 --> 00:09:34.027
Afraid Gong has no plan.

00:09:34.027 --> 00:09:36.193
But where there's
a will, there's a way!

00:09:36.193 --> 00:09:37.427
Don't you worry, Yuya.

00:09:37.427 --> 00:09:39.360
We're gonna figure
something out!

00:09:50.393 --> 00:09:52.260
Huh?
That's all?

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.127
Gotta make sure there's enough
for everyone.

00:09:55.127 --> 00:09:57.660
There is, for everyone
on the planet!

00:09:57.660 --> 00:09:59.127
We're waitin'!

00:09:59.127 --> 00:10:00.393
Yeah, move it!

00:10:00.393 --> 00:10:01.827
Hurry up
already!

00:10:01.827 --> 00:10:04.060
Huh. Enjoy your meal.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:05.727
(groans)

00:10:05.727 --> 00:10:07.327
(chuckling)
Hello.

00:10:07.327 --> 00:10:08.427
Hmm?

00:10:08.427 --> 00:10:10.493
You'll have to excuse
my friend there.

00:10:10.493 --> 00:10:13.260
He's simply not very good
with the help.

00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:14.393
As for my meal,

00:10:14.393 --> 00:10:16.027
I'm thinking steak tartare,

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:18.793
arugula salad with toasted
pine nuts and mineral water.

00:10:18.793 --> 00:10:21.893
Not even the pine nuts?

00:10:21.893 --> 00:10:22.993
We all got the same.

00:10:22.993 --> 00:10:24.560
We'll just have
to make due.

00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:26.793
He's right.
Now come on, let's go eat.

00:10:26.793 --> 00:10:30.360
I certainly hope the dessert bar
service is better.

00:10:36.327 --> 00:10:38.293
Was that a card?

00:10:38.293 --> 00:10:40.493
(Crow)
Yuya, we saved you
a seat, come on!

00:10:40.493 --> 00:10:41.893
Huh?

00:10:44.227 --> 00:10:45.493
Whoa! Uhh!

00:10:45.493 --> 00:10:47.060
Yuya!

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:48.993
Aw, what a shame!

00:10:48.993 --> 00:10:50.893
You've gotta be
more careful.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.893
Whoopsie!

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.860
(inmates laughing)

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:01.227
Not my fault!
Look.

00:11:01.227 --> 00:11:02.627
I tripped over the klutz!

00:11:02.627 --> 00:11:04.027
Shame.

00:11:04.027 --> 00:11:06.927
This is the water I used to
clean all the toilets with, too.

00:11:06.927 --> 00:11:07.860
You punk!

00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:09.660
You did that on purpose!

00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.827
Hey!
(all)
Huh?

00:11:10.827 --> 00:11:13.060
Quit causing trouble,
you hear me!

00:11:13.060 --> 00:11:14.860
Or I'll give you some!

00:11:14.860 --> 00:11:17.660
Let it go, fellas.

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.627
Best not to make a scene.

00:11:19.627 --> 00:11:21.860
Dennis and Gong will share
their food with you.

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:23.427
Hey, look there.

00:11:29.293 --> 00:11:30.927
The kingpin.

00:11:30.927 --> 00:11:32.260
Him?

00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:33.960
Kingpin?

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:36.060
Yuya.
Are you okay, buddy?

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.227
Uh...
(chuckles)

00:11:37.227 --> 00:11:40.327
Yeah, but tell me more
about this kingpin.

00:11:40.327 --> 00:11:42.260
He's tough...
and powerful.

00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.727
He controls
everything!

00:11:44.727 --> 00:11:48.960
If there's one guy you don't
want to mess with‐‐ it's him!

00:12:02.206 --> 00:12:06.040
Okay, fellas, I want you to
scrub this place 'til it shines!

00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:07.673
Seriously?

00:12:07.673 --> 00:12:09.206
Yeah, we just
got done washing

00:12:09.206 --> 00:12:11.240
every last pot and pan
from breakfast!

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.006
Can't you get someone else
to do this?

00:12:13.006 --> 00:12:14.806
Yeah, I could.

00:12:14.806 --> 00:12:18.873
But you guys did such a good job
washing all those dishes.

00:12:18.873 --> 00:12:20.840
Why would I want to
change things up?

00:12:20.840 --> 00:12:22.240
Now get to work!

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:24.540
And careful about some of
the hairballs you find.

00:12:24.540 --> 00:12:26.540
We got a rat problem.

00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:28.340
Actually, uh...

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:31.273
I was kinda feeling
a little sick, boss.

00:12:31.273 --> 00:12:33.340
A card?

00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:35.006
Me, too!
Little sick.

00:12:35.006 --> 00:12:36.773
Same here.
I need rest.

00:12:36.773 --> 00:12:38.806
I'm feeling fevery.

00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:44.106
Hmm.

00:12:44.106 --> 00:12:46.273
You can all go back to your
cells.

00:12:46.273 --> 00:12:48.106
Thank, boss.
Appreciate it.

00:12:48.106 --> 00:12:51.406
What are you looking at?
Get scrubbing!

00:12:51.406 --> 00:12:52.906
Wait!
Yeah!

00:12:52.906 --> 00:12:54.440
What was all that about?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.873
Really?

00:12:55.873 --> 00:12:58.840
If you're too dense to know,
then that's your fault.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.440
Hey!
I want answers!

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:04.306
(Dennis) Duh, Sylvio.
Haven't you figured it out yet?

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:05.906
It's really pretty simple.

00:13:05.906 --> 00:13:08.706
In this prison, dueling cards
are like credit.

00:13:08.706 --> 00:13:10.040
They can buy you things.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:11.206
And not just things.

00:13:11.206 --> 00:13:13.740
As you just saw, they can get
you favors, too.

00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:16.540
So that's why they
let us keep our decks.

00:13:16.540 --> 00:13:19.006
Man, wish someone had
told me this earlier.

00:13:19.006 --> 00:13:21.140
I'd be in the penthouse
suite by now!

00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:23.706
No way! We can't give
our cards away, Sylvio!

00:13:23.706 --> 00:13:26.773
They're worth more than anything
we would get in return.

00:13:26.773 --> 00:13:28.740
Huh? Hold up.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.440
How did you guys
know about this?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:33.406
Did you give up
your cards?

00:13:33.406 --> 00:13:35.273
I can't believe it!

00:13:35.273 --> 00:13:37.973
I've lost a lot of respect
for you, Gong.

00:13:37.973 --> 00:13:39.273
You're wrong!
Huh?

00:13:39.273 --> 00:13:41.606
You should have even more
respect for Gong.

00:13:41.606 --> 00:13:42.840
That's right.

00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:44.040
Huh?

00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:45.806
Don't worry about it,
fellas.

00:13:45.806 --> 00:13:48.306
No, this needs to be said!

00:13:48.306 --> 00:13:50.073
Before we arrived at
the Facility,

00:13:50.073 --> 00:13:52.140
both of our decks were
taken in a duel,

00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:54.273
and we didn't have a single card
to our names.

00:13:54.273 --> 00:13:58.206
(other prisoner)
So we were constantly being
tormented.

00:13:58.206 --> 00:13:59.906
That's when Gong stepped in.

00:13:59.906 --> 00:14:00.906
Huh?

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.740
Uh, what's up?

00:14:08.740 --> 00:14:10.806
Huh?
Take these.

00:14:10.806 --> 00:14:14.140
But now these two don't get
messed with anymore.

00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:17.540
(prisoner)
Everything changed after that.

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.140
(second prisoner)
And changed even more,
thanks to Dennis!

00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.673
Huh?

00:14:21.673 --> 00:14:25.640
From now on if my pals want
extra gravy they get it, cool?

00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:27.373
What can I say?

00:14:27.373 --> 00:14:29.373
Gong's a good influence on me.

00:14:29.373 --> 00:14:31.840
Sorry I accused you, Gong.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:35.173
But it's not right that the
Facility works that way.

00:14:35.173 --> 00:14:37.040
Our cards are a part of us.

00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:39.406
Yeah.
Gong agrees.

00:14:39.406 --> 00:14:41.006
(cell door opens)

00:14:41.006 --> 00:14:43.240
Let's go.
Right now.

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:45.106
Go where?

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.273
Look sharp!

00:14:50.273 --> 00:14:53.340
You're standing before
Kingpin Chojiro Tokumatsu!

00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:55.040
Hmm? Couldn't be.

00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.440
Same goes for you!

00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:58.140
You're standing before Sylvio!

00:14:58.140 --> 00:14:58.940
Quiet!
Quiet!

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:02.206
Maybe just keep
your mouth shut.

00:15:02.206 --> 00:15:04.540
I mean, like, indefinitely.
(groans)

00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.506
The cards.

00:15:06.506 --> 00:15:08.540
Tokumatsu runs this joint.

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:11.173
If you want no trouble,
then hand over your cards.

00:15:11.173 --> 00:15:12.240
(Yuya)
Or what?

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:15.006
Or face the wrath
of Tokumatsu!

00:15:15.006 --> 00:15:16.406
No, never!

00:15:16.406 --> 00:15:17.840
What'd you say?

00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:20.806
Gong's with Yuya.

00:15:20.806 --> 00:15:23.740
Taking a duelist's cards is
like taking his soul.

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.606
So, it ends right here.

00:15:25.606 --> 00:15:27.873
We're not scared of you
one bit.

00:15:27.873 --> 00:15:29.773
Yeah, you're just
a big bully,

00:15:29.773 --> 00:15:31.840
and I deal with bullies
just one way.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.040
By standing up to them!
So show me what you got!

00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:37.306
Is this wise?

00:15:37.306 --> 00:15:39.273
Yes, it is.
And dangerous.

00:15:39.273 --> 00:15:41.906
You dare defy my orders?

00:15:41.906 --> 00:15:44.506
You are very foolish indeed!

00:15:44.506 --> 00:15:46.940
I wield great power here!

00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:49.506
I can make your lives most
unpleasant.

00:15:49.506 --> 00:15:51.873
Now, I repeat,
give me your cards!

00:15:51.873 --> 00:15:53.473
(Yuya)
And I repeat,

00:15:53.473 --> 00:15:55.740
that's not gonna happen,
King‐pinhead!

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.506
You insolent child!

00:15:57.506 --> 00:16:00.506
Perhaps this will
change your mind!

00:16:04.273 --> 00:16:05.406
Huh?

00:16:08.406 --> 00:16:09.406
No way!

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.573
(all)
Aah!

00:16:12.573 --> 00:16:14.440
Behold.

00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:16.273
My duel card collection.

00:16:16.273 --> 00:16:18.740
Some I have won in battle,
some I have been given,

00:16:18.740 --> 00:16:21.740
but the cards all tell
of the same tale.

00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:23.773
And what tale might that be?

00:16:23.773 --> 00:16:26.506
That I am all powerful,
of course.

00:16:26.506 --> 00:16:28.406
That's what dueling
is all about.

00:16:28.406 --> 00:16:30.240
Don't think so.

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:32.673
Duels are all about
having fun!

00:16:32.673 --> 00:16:34.140
Fun?

00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:36.340
Get out!

00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.206
Boss, can you
believe this kid?

00:16:38.206 --> 00:16:40.506
He belongs in the nuthouse,
not the big house!

00:16:40.506 --> 00:16:42.106
(laughing)

00:16:42.106 --> 00:16:45.073
You sound like
a halfwit hyena!

00:16:45.073 --> 00:16:46.740
Yes, sir.
Yes, I do.

00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.706
As for you, you've made
your decision,

00:16:48.706 --> 00:16:51.306
so you must now live
with the consequences.

00:16:51.306 --> 00:16:52.540
Guard!

00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.773
Ahoy?
Did you ring?

00:16:54.773 --> 00:16:55.773
Aah!

00:16:55.773 --> 00:16:57.973
Bring me two Duel Disks.

00:16:57.973 --> 00:17:00.706
We are going to have a match.

00:17:00.706 --> 00:17:02.806
Huh? Ooh, an Ultra Rare!

00:17:02.806 --> 00:17:05.240
Yes. Duel Disks on the way!

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:08.973
And you, child, are well on your
way to a rude awakening.

00:17:08.973 --> 00:17:12.706
If you don't believe me that
dueling is all about power,

00:17:12.706 --> 00:17:14.306
then I'll demonstrate.

00:17:14.306 --> 00:17:16.206
By overpowering you!

00:17:16.206 --> 00:17:19.177
So let's do this!

00:17:29.909 --> 00:17:31.943
♪

00:17:31.943 --> 00:17:34.276
Don't you forget, young one.

00:17:34.276 --> 00:17:37.109
We're in a prison,
so there's no place to run.

00:17:37.109 --> 00:17:38.843
Great! So when
you start losing,

00:17:38.843 --> 00:17:40.476
you can't go hide!

00:17:40.476 --> 00:17:41.443
Why you...

00:17:41.443 --> 00:17:43.409
Enough!

00:17:43.409 --> 00:17:45.043
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:51.009 --> 00:17:53.076
Look.
That duel stance.

00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:56.209
Yeah, it's a stance
that I recognize.

00:17:56.209 --> 00:17:58.043
I'll go first!

00:17:58.043 --> 00:18:01.043
And I'll activate the spell
Flower Gathering!

00:18:01.043 --> 00:18:04.409
This powerful card
allows me to summon

00:18:04.409 --> 00:18:07.776
four Flower Cardians from my
deck in attack mode.

00:18:07.776 --> 00:18:09.176
Behold!

00:18:09.176 --> 00:18:11.709
The fine and formidable flora:

00:18:11.709 --> 00:18:14.409
Flower Cardian Pine,
Zebra Grass, Willow,

00:18:14.409 --> 00:18:16.609
and lastly, Paulownia!

00:18:16.609 --> 00:18:19.476
Wow, four cards out
just like that!

00:18:19.476 --> 00:18:22.409
Next, I activate
the sweet smelling spell card

00:18:22.409 --> 00:18:23.709
Flower Stacking!

00:18:23.709 --> 00:18:25.009
I'm allowed to select

00:18:25.009 --> 00:18:27.809
three Flower Cardian monsters
in my deck

00:18:27.809 --> 00:18:30.276
and place them
on top of my deck

00:18:30.276 --> 00:18:32.476
in any order I like!

00:18:32.476 --> 00:18:34.676
And the Flower Cardians
I select are:

00:18:34.676 --> 00:18:37.576
Zebra Grass With Moon,
Paulownia With Phoenix,

00:18:37.576 --> 00:18:40.043
and Willow with Calligrapher!

00:18:41.609 --> 00:18:43.376
Next I'll activate
Flower Cardian

00:18:43.376 --> 00:18:45.576
with Pine's special ability!

00:18:45.576 --> 00:18:49.243
Pine with Crane takes my first
Pine's place.

00:18:52.243 --> 00:18:53.509
But I'm not done.

00:18:53.509 --> 00:18:55.643
Since Pine With Crane was
successfully summoned,

00:18:55.643 --> 00:18:57.943
I can draw another card
from my deck.

00:18:57.943 --> 00:19:01.543
Zebra Grass With Moon,
and I use its ability!

00:19:01.543 --> 00:19:04.809
By tributing my first Zebra
Grass, I can summon it!

00:19:06.443 --> 00:19:10.309
And as before, I get to draw
a card this time as well!

00:19:10.309 --> 00:19:13.143
And that card is Paulownia
With Phoenix,

00:19:13.143 --> 00:19:15.643
and now I'll use its
special ability!

00:19:15.643 --> 00:19:19.109
Allowing me to increase my
bouquet of devastation.

00:19:19.109 --> 00:19:21.876
I can now draw another card!

00:19:21.876 --> 00:19:25.676
And that card is Willow
With Calligrapher!

00:19:25.676 --> 00:19:27.376
And by activating its ability,

00:19:27.376 --> 00:19:30.976
I can tribute my earlier Willow
and summon it forth!

00:19:30.976 --> 00:19:32.743
Your defeat is taking root,

00:19:32.743 --> 00:19:35.576
and my victory is blossoming
into reality!

00:19:35.576 --> 00:19:37.609
Simply amazing!

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:40.009
He just keeps summoning more
powerful monsters.

00:19:40.009 --> 00:19:41.309
Will it ever end?

00:19:41.309 --> 00:19:45.009
I drew Flower Cardian Cherry
Blossom, with Curtain.

00:19:45.009 --> 00:19:48.243
However, since Cherry Blossom
is not on my field,

00:19:48.243 --> 00:19:50.676
I must send this card
to the graveyard.

00:19:50.676 --> 00:19:53.109
Now, time to put my foot down.

00:19:53.109 --> 00:19:56.709
It's time to prove to you that
dueling is for power

00:19:56.709 --> 00:19:58.476
and not for fun!

00:19:58.476 --> 00:20:02.609
And time to use Willow With
Calligrapher's special ability!

00:20:02.609 --> 00:20:06.076
With it, all my monsters'
Levels become two!

00:20:08.443 --> 00:20:12.643
But in exchange,
I'm able to Synchro Summon!

00:20:19.576 --> 00:20:22.876
Behold, dueling at its
very best!

00:20:22.876 --> 00:20:25.043
Dueling at its most powerful!

00:20:25.043 --> 00:20:28.709
I synchro summon!

00:20:28.709 --> 00:20:33.243
Rise, Level Eight Flower Cardian
Lightshower!

00:20:36.976 --> 00:20:40.676
That monster's packing some
serious flower power.

00:20:40.676 --> 00:20:44.409
I'll now place two cards
facedown to end my turn.

00:20:44.409 --> 00:20:48.576
Now you see what power can do.

00:20:48.576 --> 00:20:50.509
And soon, you shall feel it.

00:20:50.509 --> 00:20:53.776
The only thing that I'm feeling
is a rush of excitement!

00:20:53.776 --> 00:20:55.709
'Cause the fun
is just starting!

00:20:55.709 --> 00:20:57.243
My draw!

00:20:57.243 --> 00:20:58.809
Let's see how fun
you think this is.

00:20:58.809 --> 00:21:00.209
Whenever you draw a card,

00:21:00.209 --> 00:21:03.576
I can now activate Flower
Cardian Lightshower's ability

00:21:03.576 --> 00:21:07.909
which deals you
1,500 points of damage!

00:21:07.909 --> 00:21:09.276
Yuya!

00:21:09.276 --> 00:21:11.476
But that would mean that
every time Yuya draws,

00:21:11.476 --> 00:21:12.843
he'll take damage!

00:21:12.843 --> 00:21:15.309
Kinda makes you wonder how much
fun he's having now.

00:21:15.309 --> 00:21:18.043
Nice move you pulled
on me there, Dingpin,

00:21:18.043 --> 00:21:20.276
but I got one even better!
What?

00:21:20.276 --> 00:21:22.809
I set the Pendulum Scale
with Scale Three

00:21:22.809 --> 00:21:27.176
Performapal Bit Bite Turtle and
Scale Eight Timegazer Magician!

00:21:27.176 --> 00:21:30.343
I'm taking control of this duel,
starting now!

00:21:38.109 --> 00:21:39.976
My.

00:21:39.976 --> 00:21:42.709
Dueling has changed a lot since
I was locked up.

00:21:42.709 --> 00:21:45.643
I can summon monsters between
Levels Four and Seven

00:21:45.643 --> 00:21:47.143
all at the same time!

00:21:47.143 --> 00:21:48.776
At the same time?

00:21:48.776 --> 00:21:53.343
Swing far Pendulum!
Carve the arc of victory!

00:21:54.709 --> 00:21:59.143
My monsters are ready to swing
into action!

00:22:02.209 --> 00:22:04.876
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:22:04.876 --> 00:22:07.109
(roaring)

00:22:07.109 --> 00:22:10.576
See‐saw to it, Performapal
Teeter Totter Hopper!

00:22:10.576 --> 00:22:14.043
Crawl to victory, Performapal
Sellshell Crab!

00:22:14.043 --> 00:22:15.376
Hmm.

00:22:15.376 --> 00:22:17.676
I'm activating the trap card
Fraud Freeze!

00:22:17.676 --> 00:22:20.109
Every monster you Special
Summoned from your hand

00:22:20.109 --> 00:22:22.076
returns to your hand,

00:22:22.076 --> 00:22:23.943
so all of your monster's
will be gone!

00:22:23.943 --> 00:22:26.843
Oh, no!

00:22:26.843 --> 00:22:28.476
Not good.

00:22:28.476 --> 00:22:31.743
If Yuya Pendulum summons again,
the same thing will happen!

00:22:31.743 --> 00:22:33.509
Not good is right.
'Cause after all,

00:22:33.509 --> 00:22:35.809
Pendulum Summoning's key
to Yuya's tactics!

00:22:35.809 --> 00:22:38.843
And key to finishing this
duel as quick as possible,

00:22:38.843 --> 00:22:40.909
because Lightshower
deals big damage

00:22:40.909 --> 00:22:42.543
whenever Yuya draws a card.

00:22:42.543 --> 00:22:44.143
Yuya.

00:22:45.309 --> 00:22:47.743
Perhaps now you
finally understand

00:22:47.743 --> 00:22:50.209
that power is
everything, Yuya.

00:22:50.209 --> 00:22:53.643
And you'd better believe this
power is only growing.

00:22:53.643 --> 00:22:55.809
The worst is yet to come!

00:22:55.809 --> 00:22:58.376
