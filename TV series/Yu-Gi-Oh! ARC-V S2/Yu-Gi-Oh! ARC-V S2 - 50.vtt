Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"&amp;

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.633
I thought you were
bringing your "A" game today,

00:00:06.633 --> 00:00:09.300
but you and your monsters
have flunked miserably!

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.266
We've been saving
the very best for last!

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:14.166
It's showtime!

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:17.266
(announcer on PA)
Folks, I can feel
the electricity!

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:20.233
The whole city has rallied
behind Yuya!

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:22.766
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.366
That's a wrap!

00:00:27.366 --> 00:00:31.600
(announcer)
The Friendship Cup has a new
champion, Yuya Sakaki!

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.766
Let's hear it for Yuya,
New Domino City!

00:00:33.766 --> 00:00:35.266
<i>He earned it today!</i>

00:00:35.266 --> 00:00:36.966
Yeah!
That's right!

00:00:36.966 --> 00:00:41.300
(man on PA)
Today Jack and Yuya showed us
the city can be unified.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.400
New Domino will no longer
be divided in two.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.466
Instead, you must
work together

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:50.000
to build a better future
for all our citizens!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.266
<i>Yuya!</i>

00:00:51.266 --> 00:00:52.900
<i>Roget took Zuzu!</i>

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.100
He did what?

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.666
Roget said...
he's taking Zuzu...

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:01.233
back to...
Duel Academy‐‐ Aagh!

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:02.733
Sora!

00:01:02.733 --> 00:01:04.000
You're nuts!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Only a madman would program
his own headquarters

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.700
to
self‐destruct!

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.766
What better way
to cover my tracks

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:12.333
than to leave no tracks
at all?

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:15.766
To make it any further,
you'd have to get past me.

00:01:15.766 --> 00:01:16.900
Let's duel!

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.866
Don't worry, Zuzu!

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.000
Roget isn't taking you anywhere!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.700
That's a promise!

I'd never guess a guy like you
would be so light on your feet!

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:35.333
Slow down!!

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.633
Gong don't slow down when
Gong's friends are in trouble!

00:02:38.233 --> 00:02:40.133
(plane roaring)

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:41.733
It's Shay.

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:44.666
Come on, you could've given us
a ride, you jerk!

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:57.166
You ready?

00:02:57.166 --> 00:02:58.400
Yeah!

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.900
Who needs a door,

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.300
Smash it, Rise Falcon!

00:03:15.766 --> 00:03:18.733
You say that you're the best
Duel Academy has to offer.

00:03:18.733 --> 00:03:20.133
If that's truly the case

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:22.866
then I guess my father
has lowered his standards.

00:03:22.866 --> 00:03:24.900
Oh, Declan,
once I get through

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.833
knocking your sorry self
off your high horse,

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:30.633
I shall drag you back
to your father,

00:03:30.633 --> 00:03:34.400
and then proceed to show him
how far his son has fallen.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.200
You're living
in a dream world,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.333
and I'm here to wake you up
with a painful dose of reality.

00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:41.600
Defeating me and running back
to Duel Academy

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:43.600
isn't going
to happen.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.733
You will fail as usual.

00:03:46.733 --> 00:03:48.266
Verbal claptrap.

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.066
Say whatever
you'd like, Roget,

00:03:50.066 --> 00:03:51.866
but I promise you this:

00:03:51.866 --> 00:03:55.966
Your days of troublemaking
end here and now!

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:58.966
And to make good on my word,
I'm activating the spell card

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:01.166
Forbidden Dark Contract
With The Swamp King!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.933
I can now summon D/D/D Chaos
King Apocalypse!

00:04:06.933 --> 00:04:09.733
(roaring)

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:15.700
Its reign
will be short.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:18.000
You're right because
thanks to my spell,

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.366
I can use Chaos King
to summon a Fusion monster

00:04:21.366 --> 00:04:24.733
without using
Polymerization.

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:29.366
I fuse Chaos King Apocalypse
and D/D Lamia!

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:39.533
I fusion summon D/D/D
Dragonbane King Beowulf!

00:04:44.866 --> 00:04:48.333
Fusion summoning
without Polymerization.

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:50.600
You must think
you're so clever, Declan.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600
There's no thinking
about it, Roget.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:54.133
I know it as fact...

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:58.533
Because when I use my
Tuner Monster D/D Lamia
to Fusion Summon,

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:03.133
I can discard my spell Forbidden
Dark Contract With The Swamp
King to the graveyard

00:05:03.133 --> 00:05:06.366
which allows me
to bring back D/D Lamia!

00:05:11.966 --> 00:05:13.033
A Tuner?

00:05:13.033 --> 00:05:14.833
That means you can
Synchro Summon!

00:05:14.833 --> 00:05:17.133
I can do more
than that.
What?

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:20.700
I'm going to crush you and
your monsters into oblivion!

00:05:24.066 --> 00:05:26.566
Zuzu!

00:05:26.566 --> 00:05:27.733
Where are you?

00:05:27.733 --> 00:05:29.366
I'm setting
the Pendulum Scale

00:05:29.366 --> 00:05:32.333
with my
Scale 6 D/D Savant Thomas

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:35.233
and my Scale 8 D/D
Savant Nikola,

00:05:35.233 --> 00:05:37.600
I Pendulum Summon!

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:47.400
Now I can summon as many Level 7
monsters as I see fit!

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.766
The energy
of the universe swings

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:51.366
between the forces of
darkness and of light.

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:54.900
I shall now harness the power of
this eternal oscillation!

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:57.133
I Pendulum Summon

00:05:57.133 --> 00:06:01.166
and call upon my D/D/D Chaos
King Apocalypse once again!

00:06:01.866 --> 00:06:03.833
(monster roaring)

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:11.166
Level 1 D/D Lamia tunes Level 7
Chaos King Apocalypse!

00:06:20.133 --> 00:06:21.800
I Synchro Summon!

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.733
Appear, Level 8 D/D/D Cursed
King Siegfried!

00:06:28.633 --> 00:06:31.033
He paired Synchro Summoning
with Pendulum?

00:06:31.033 --> 00:06:34.400
D/D/D Cursed King Siegfried
negates a spell or trap card

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.200
until your next turn,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:38.700
so the effect of your
Magic Shield is history!

00:06:38.700 --> 00:06:42.566
So what was once indestructible
is now target practice.

00:06:42.566 --> 00:06:45.800
You think you can outduel me?
Well, think again, Roget!

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:47.633
You're finished!

00:06:53.633 --> 00:06:55.666
Blast you, Declan!

00:06:55.666 --> 00:06:56.800
Now Beowulf!

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:59.333
Attack Ancient Gear Howitzer!

00:06:59.333 --> 00:07:03.800
Beowulf deals you damage even if
your monster is in defense mode!

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:14.800
Your reign over New Domino City
ends here and now, Roget!

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.666
Siegfried, attack
and finish this duel!

00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:29.566
(Roget laughs)

00:07:29.566 --> 00:07:31.133
Nothing's finished.

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:33.133
Did you really think
you'd won?

00:07:33.133 --> 00:07:35.433
Because I have
zero life points?

00:07:35.433 --> 00:07:37.333
I'm beyond
life points.

00:07:37.333 --> 00:07:39.200
I'm immortal!

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:41.833
Declan, you must
be careful.

00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:44.066
Roget duels as though
he has nine lives.

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:46.900
All right, it's time
to finish you off!

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.700
(roaring)

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:55.766
He's gone!

00:07:55.766 --> 00:07:58.100
Like his life points.

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:00.666
(Roget laughs)

00:08:00.666 --> 00:08:04.033
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty:
2,000 life points.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.500
(laughing loudly)

00:08:12.933 --> 00:08:14.166
How is this possible?

00:08:14.166 --> 00:08:16.500
What crazy magic trick
is this?

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:17.500
No trick.

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.766
I am immortal,
Declan.

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.533
You might defeat me,
but you'll never win.

00:08:22.533 --> 00:08:25.800
And you will never
get rid of me, ever.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:30.133
No matter how hard you try,
no matter how strong you duel,

00:08:30.133 --> 00:08:32.666
you will eventually fall
to me, Declan.

00:08:32.666 --> 00:08:35.500
I'm an unstoppable force
that will never relent

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.900
until you're nothing
but a shattered shell.

00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:39.766
(laughing)

00:08:42.966 --> 00:08:45.733
Well, this communication center
has seen better days.

00:08:45.733 --> 00:08:49.533
Hopefully Sora got outta here
before it got blasted.

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:52.600
Yeah, and hopefully he's
in better shape than this room.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.766
Don't worry about Sora,
the kid's gonna be fine.

00:08:55.766 --> 00:08:58.000
How do you know?
Did you see him?

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.166
No, but I've seen him
in action.

00:09:02.166 --> 00:09:05.966
He's as tough as they come,
and I got the scars to prove it.

00:09:05.966 --> 00:09:08.833
Ninjas can break
into many places...

00:09:08.833 --> 00:09:11.900
(groans),
just not cyberspace.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:12.966
Riley!

00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:13.966
Moon Shadow!

00:09:13.966 --> 00:09:14.900
Yuya!

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.366
Have you seen Zuzu?

00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:19.066
My brother's locked in there
with her and Roget.

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:21.766
We tried everything,
but we can't break in.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:28.766
I'm activating D/D Savant
Thomas' Pendulum ability

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:31.233
which permits me to return
one Pendulum Monster

00:09:31.233 --> 00:09:33.666
in my Extra Deck
to my hand.

00:09:35.766 --> 00:09:39.500
And that monster is
D/D/D Chaos King Apocalypse.

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:43.866
And with that, I'll end
with a facedown.

00:09:43.866 --> 00:09:46.366
So, you still want
to keep dueling?

00:09:46.366 --> 00:09:48.466
My, you're forever
the optimist.

00:09:48.466 --> 00:09:51.066
Well,
here's a reality check.

00:09:51.066 --> 00:09:52.566
You never
had a chance!

00:09:52.566 --> 00:09:53.966
(laughing)

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:56.966
Let's see.

00:09:56.966 --> 00:09:58.866
Maybe we should try
kicking it again?

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:00.500
Yuya!

00:10:00.500 --> 00:10:01.433
Gong!

00:10:01.433 --> 00:10:03.500
Perfect timing!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.266
We need your help, buddy.

00:10:05.266 --> 00:10:07.233
You gotta "Gongdoze"
this door

00:10:07.233 --> 00:10:10.366
so we can rescue Zuzu
and Declan from Roget!

00:10:10.366 --> 00:10:12.733
We tried to bust the lock,
but no such luck!

00:10:12.733 --> 00:10:14.233
Sheesh!

00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:17.566
Can't you guys do anything
on your own?

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:20.066
(Yuya)
Sora!

00:10:20.066 --> 00:10:25.166
I guess it's up to me to save
the day once again for you guys.

00:10:25.166 --> 00:10:26.433
(moaning)
Sora!

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:28.666
I got you!

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:31.966
And I'll get to...
unlocking that lock.

00:10:31.966 --> 00:10:33.766
It's been a long day,

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:37.800
but I have one more trick
up my sleeve.

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:41.933
All right, let me show you guys
how a hero does some "heroing."

00:10:50.533 --> 00:10:52.033
Zuzu!
Declan!

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.600
We're in an interesting
situation.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:10:59.800
A never‐ending duel.

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:01.633
Never‐ending?

00:11:01.633 --> 00:11:02.833
That's right!

00:11:02.833 --> 00:11:04.366
Which means I can
never be defeated!

00:11:04.366 --> 00:11:05.433
No.

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:07.800
Not necessarily.
(Roget scoffs)

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:09.766
One of us
could decide to quit.

00:11:10.733 --> 00:11:12.266
You.

00:11:12.266 --> 00:11:14.866
Are you suggesting
that I might forfeit?

00:11:14.866 --> 00:11:16.366
(laughing)

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:18.100
Absolutely
ludicrous!

00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:20.133
It's my turn!
Ha!

00:11:20.133 --> 00:11:23.566
D/D/D Chaos King Apocalypse's
special ability allows me

00:11:23.566 --> 00:11:25.566
to summon it
during your turn!

00:11:25.566 --> 00:11:27.533
(roaring)

00:11:29.966 --> 00:11:33.133
But by doing so, I must get rid
of D/D Savant Thomas

00:11:33.133 --> 00:11:35.766
and D/D Savant Nikola
from my Pendulum Zone.

00:11:35.766 --> 00:11:38.100
I know for a fact
that Pendulum Summoning

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.466
is an important weapon
for you.

00:11:40.466 --> 00:11:44.533
So now that you have abandoned
it, you are never going to win!

00:11:44.533 --> 00:11:46.500
I wouldn't be
so sure.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.200
When D/D Savant Nikola
is destroyed,

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.066
I can return one Pendulum
Monster on the field to my hand.

00:11:53.066 --> 00:11:55.866
This allows me to once again
set the Pendulum Scale

00:11:55.866 --> 00:11:58.966
with Savant Nikola
and Savant Thomas.

00:11:58.966 --> 00:12:01.766
And now, I activate
the trap

00:12:01.766 --> 00:12:04.633
Dark Contract
with the Swinging Abyss!

00:12:04.633 --> 00:12:07.833
Whenever a D/D Pendulum Monster
returns to my hand,

00:12:07.833 --> 00:12:11.733
my opponent takes damage equal
to my monster's defense points.

00:12:11.733 --> 00:12:14.966
Chaos Apocalypse
has 2,000 defense points.

00:12:14.966 --> 00:12:17.766
So you take 2,000 points
of damage,

00:12:17.766 --> 00:12:20.733
which is all the life
points you have left!

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.266
Roget's gone!

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:28.200
Not for long.

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:30.000
(laughing)

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:32.533
Like I said,
I can keep resurrecting.

00:12:32.533 --> 00:12:34.366
How's he able
to do that?

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:37.666
Intrusion penalty:
2,000 life points.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.566
You can never
get rid of me, Declan.

00:12:41.566 --> 00:12:42.733
Yes.

00:12:42.733 --> 00:12:46.533
And now I have you exactly
where I want you, Roget.

00:12:46.533 --> 00:12:47.900
That's absurd!

00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:49.300
Is it?

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:53.200
I can destroy D/D Savant Thomas
and D/D Savant Nicola again

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.366
to summon
Chaos King Apocalypse.

00:12:55.366 --> 00:12:59.066
And by returning Chaos King
Apocalypse to my hand,

00:12:59.066 --> 00:13:04.866
I set the Pendulum Scale
once more,

00:13:04.866 --> 00:13:07.766
which triggers my Dark
Contract With Swinging Abyss

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:10.400
that deals you 2,000 points
of damage,

00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:13.466
which eliminates
all your life points.

00:13:13.466 --> 00:13:15.033
So when you resurrect,

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:19.200
I just do this combo all over
and defeat you again.

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.233
And again and again,
until the end of time!

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:25.266
(gasping)

00:13:25.266 --> 00:13:26.733
So, you lose,
Roget,

00:13:26.733 --> 00:13:29.933
and I'm talking
to the real Roget up there!

00:13:32.366 --> 00:13:33.766
(Yuya)
Zuzu!

00:13:33.766 --> 00:13:37.400
You could never
fool me, Roget!

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.833
Declan, you think
you're so smart?

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:42.500
Well, I have Zuzu and
I'm bringing her back with me

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:44.266
to the Fusion Dimension

00:13:44.266 --> 00:13:48.266
and handing her over
to your father, the Professor!

00:13:48.266 --> 00:13:49.666
Gong don't
get it!

00:13:49.666 --> 00:13:52.966
He hasn't told you about
his famous father, has he?

00:13:52.966 --> 00:13:54.466
That doesn't
surprise me.

00:13:54.466 --> 00:13:56.600
He's Leo Akaba.
The Professor.

00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:58.500
The leader
of Duel Academy!

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:59.733
Duel Academy?

00:13:59.733 --> 00:14:02.066
So, then his pops
is the head honcho

00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:03.400
of the guys
we're fighting?

00:14:03.400 --> 00:14:05.066
This don't add up
to Gong!

00:14:05.066 --> 00:14:07.866
There's no way
Declan's the Professor's boy!

00:14:07.866 --> 00:14:09.266
It's true.

00:14:09.266 --> 00:14:10.900
And Declan's
cunning duplicity

00:14:10.900 --> 00:14:12.666
has made all of you
unwitting accomplices

00:14:12.666 --> 00:14:14.100
in the dimensional war!

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.633
Impossible!

00:14:15.633 --> 00:14:17.166
Oh,
don't be naiïve.

00:14:17.166 --> 00:14:20.233
The Professor's master plan
was to split the work.

00:14:20.233 --> 00:14:23.466
He conquers
the Fusion and Xyz Dimensions,

00:14:23.466 --> 00:14:27.533
his son Declan the Standard
and Synchro Dimensions.

00:14:27.533 --> 00:14:28.833
Declan never told you

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:31.033
the Lancers are
the Akabas' private army!

00:14:31.033 --> 00:14:32.433
(gasping)

00:14:32.433 --> 00:14:35.566
I'm in their way, of course,
so they want me eliminated.

00:14:35.566 --> 00:14:36.633
(chuckling)

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:38.600
Things are going according
to their plan.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.166
Once I'm pushed aside,

00:14:40.166 --> 00:14:42.866
Declan will declare himself
king of this city‐‐

00:14:42.866 --> 00:14:45.066
nay, of the whole
Synchro Dimension!

00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:47.533
(laughing)

00:14:47.533 --> 00:14:49.600
You've laid out
a very convincing story

00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:51.300
except for
one thing.

00:14:51.300 --> 00:14:53.300
If what you are saying
is true,

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:56.300
then why did the Professor
send you to this dimension?

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.033
After all, you did say
you were the best duelist

00:14:59.033 --> 00:15:01.233
Duel Academy had
to offer.

00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:06.233
You're nothing
but a no good liar, Roget!

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:07.700
(grunting
with malice)

00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:09.933
I believe Declan
a hundred percent!

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:11.333
He's trying
to help us all

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:14.600
but you're just trying
to help yourself!

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.166
Let Zuzu go!

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.866
I'm afraid I can't.

00:15:17.866 --> 00:15:19.633
Your friend
is my lifeline!

00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:22.233
Zuzu is the key
to my survival.

00:15:22.233 --> 00:15:23.466
I'll never let her go.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:29.133
Move it!

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:32.000
Zuzu!

00:15:35.466 --> 00:15:36.666
Now then...

00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:39.533
Off to the Professor
and Duel Academy we go.

00:15:39.533 --> 00:15:41.133
He should reward me
quite handsomely

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:43.500
for delivering
such a worthy prize.

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.100
Oh, I wouldn't worry
too much,

00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.233
I'm sure your cell won't be
too cold and damp.

00:15:48.233 --> 00:15:50.400
I can't wait
to see his face.

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.466
Hey Roget!

00:15:52.466 --> 00:15:54.466
Next floor's
your last!

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:56.933
'Cause your ride's
about to hit rock bottom!

00:15:56.933 --> 00:15:59.933
You're the one who threw
New Domino City into chaos

00:15:59.933 --> 00:16:03.066
and you're going to pay,
the hard way!

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:05.333
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend:

00:16:05.333 --> 00:16:07.766
Turn up the heat!

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:17.100
(Roget and Zuzu screaming)

00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.433
Oh, no!

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:30.166
Zuzu!

00:16:30.166 --> 00:16:32.166
Hip Hippo!

00:16:41.133 --> 00:16:43.333
Zuzu.
Wake up.

00:16:43.333 --> 00:16:44.566
It's all right.

00:16:44.566 --> 00:16:45.966
You're safe now.

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.100
I'm safe.

00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:52.433
I missed you.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:56.633
We're finally
back together.

00:16:56.633 --> 00:17:01.733
And I'll never let you
outta my sight again!

00:17:01.733 --> 00:17:03.766
(sobbing)

00:17:18.666 --> 00:17:20.900
(Roget, scoffing)
You think you're all safe!

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:22.033
Roget!

00:17:22.033 --> 00:17:25.333
That you've defeated me
and won?

00:17:25.333 --> 00:17:26.866
(grunting)

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:29.200
Wow, he doesn't know
when to quit.

00:17:30.533 --> 00:17:33.633
Of course not, I always have
another plan ready.

00:17:33.633 --> 00:17:35.000
What you're standing on

00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:38.500
is the biggest interdimensional
transporter known to man!

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.266
And with it, I'm sending you all
plummeting to other dimensions!

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:43.500
That's crazy!

00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:45.866
He's two cards short
of a deck!

00:17:45.866 --> 00:17:50.133
And the best part, I have no
idea where you'll end up.

00:17:50.133 --> 00:17:52.766
I hope that you don't
scare easily.

00:17:52.766 --> 00:17:55.866
Some of these dimensions
can be quite horrific.

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:58.966
And this
is checkmate!

00:17:58.966 --> 00:18:01.033
I'm clearing
the board.

00:18:01.033 --> 00:18:02.533
Bon voyage, Yuya!

00:18:02.533 --> 00:18:04.000
You lose!

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000
You all lose!
(laughing)

00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:12.000
(laughing)

00:18:12.866 --> 00:18:14.666
I've really outdone myself.

00:18:14.666 --> 00:18:16.733
This is an incomparable end
game!

00:18:16.733 --> 00:18:19.266
(moaning)

00:18:20.033 --> 00:18:21.066
Riley!

00:18:21.066 --> 00:18:22.233
Ohhh!

00:18:22.233 --> 00:18:24.533
Riley!

00:18:24.533 --> 00:18:26.033
You saved me.

00:18:27.333 --> 00:18:29.166
Hang on!

00:18:38.233 --> 00:18:41.800
(frightened gasps)

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:54.066
(laughing wildly)

00:18:54.066 --> 00:18:57.333
It's time, time for you all
to fall!

00:18:57.333 --> 00:19:01.333
You're all going into the void,
to disappear forever!

00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.033
Ta‐ta!

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:06.433
See you never!

00:19:13.233 --> 00:19:16.366
(Roget screaming)
No!

00:19:21.933 --> 00:19:24.900
Huh?
The hole's closed up!

00:19:24.900 --> 00:19:27.033
And we're all
in one piece.

00:19:35.066 --> 00:19:37.500
Are we safe now?

00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:39.100
We are.

00:19:39.100 --> 00:19:43.000
Everything's gonna be okay,
Zuzu, I promise.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.533
'Cause you're back
with your friends.

00:19:45.533 --> 00:19:47.933
And Roget won't
bother us anymore.

00:19:47.933 --> 00:19:50.300
So let's win this war
and go home.

00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:51.600
Yuya...

00:19:58.300 --> 00:20:00.733
I'm glad
you're all right.

00:20:08.933 --> 00:20:09.866
What the‐‐

00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:11.800
Yuya, what's
happening now?

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:14.666
Not sure, but it looks like
the dimensional transporter

00:20:14.666 --> 00:20:15.833
is
rebooting again.

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:17.033
(Zuzu screams)

00:20:17.033 --> 00:20:19.433
Zuzu!
Yuya!

00:20:20.633 --> 00:20:23.066
Zuzu!

00:20:23.066 --> 00:20:25.000
Aaaah!

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:27.000
Don't let go!

00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:37.266
(all screaming)

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.666
What happened?

00:20:47.666 --> 00:20:49.300
I'm not sure...

00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.033
But it seems likely Roget's
dimensional transporter
malfunctioned

00:20:53.033 --> 00:20:55.066
and created a wormhole.

00:20:55.066 --> 00:20:56.433
A wormhole?

00:20:56.433 --> 00:20:58.600
(Sora)
It's a kind of connection
through space.

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:01.200
Almost like a tunnel
between dimensions.

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.600
That's right.

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.766
But wormholes aren't routes that
can be predictably traveled.

00:21:05.766 --> 00:21:07.800
So where's Yuya
and the others?

00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:10.200
They were transported
to another dimension.

00:21:10.200 --> 00:21:12.266
But I don't know
which one,

00:21:12.266 --> 00:21:15.633
or if we will ever
find out which one.

00:21:15.633 --> 00:21:18.533
They may be lost
forever.

00:21:33.566 --> 00:21:34.666
Huh?

00:21:40.133 --> 00:21:41.366
Whoa!

00:21:41.366 --> 00:21:43.833
Looks like New Domino City
got totally blown away!

00:21:43.833 --> 00:21:46.033
We're not
in New Domino City.

00:21:46.033 --> 00:21:47.533
(Gong)
How do you know?

00:21:47.533 --> 00:21:51.033
Because this is my home,
or what's left of it.

00:21:51.900 --> 00:21:53.766
We're in the Xyz Dimension.
