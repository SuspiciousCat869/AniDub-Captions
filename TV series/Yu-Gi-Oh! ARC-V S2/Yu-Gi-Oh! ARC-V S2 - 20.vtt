WEBVTT

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.100
(crowd cheering)

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.700
(crowd) Commons! Commons!
Commons!

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.700
Whoa.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.300
This here Friendship Cup crowd

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.400
doesn't sound so friendly
anymore.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.800
(crowd)
Commons! Commons! Commons!

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.266
Commons! Commons!

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.600
Uh, okay, well,

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.200
time to mosey on up to our next
big matchup,

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.300
and for that we've got an
oldie but a goodie for you:

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.100
<i>Chojiro the Hero!</i>

00:00:34.666 --> 00:00:37.333
These new duel runner's
sure are fancy.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.900
Back in my day, we dueled on
bicycles.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.566
(Melissa, on P. A.) He was
one of the top duelists

00:00:42.566 --> 00:00:44.866
when this cowgirl
was just a calf.

00:00:44.866 --> 00:00:48.100
I wonder if this old dog has
learned any new tricks.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.966
Chojiro.

00:00:53.666 --> 00:00:55.733
I've been away
ten long years,

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:57.433
and I have missed you all!

00:00:57.433 --> 00:01:01.033
But your hero is back
and better than ever!

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:05.466
(thinking)
And I have Yuya and my cellmates
to thank for that.

00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:09.133
Yuya reminded me how much fun
dueling can be,

00:01:09.133 --> 00:01:12.766
and my fellow friends risked
everything to help me escape.

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:14.900
And I owe them big time.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.633
I owe them a win.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:19.866
(Melissa)
<i>Facing our senior dreamer</i>

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:24.166
is the dueling diva,
Zuzu Boyle!

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:26.333
Zuzu!?

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.933
All right, Zuzu, remember
everything I taught you.

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:32.600
Step on the gas, go fast
and don't finish last.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.300
Zuzu's gonna zig‐zag
her way to a win!

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.266
Somebody call my agent!

00:01:37.266 --> 00:01:41.066
(Melissa)
Dueling in the Friendship Cup
for the first time is no rodeo.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:44.166
I wonder what's racing
through her mind?

00:01:44.166 --> 00:01:46.633
(thinking)
Yuya.

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.200
Oh, no,

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.000
One'll win, but the other
will lose.

I gotta stop the duel!

00:02:57.066 --> 00:02:59.700
I can't let my friends
battle each other!

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.166
(Melissa)This is sure to be
one doozy of a duel, folks,

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:07.033
with newcomer Zuzu Boyle
takingon the legendary Hero
Chojiro.

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.100
This couldn't be worse.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100
No matter who wins,
one of my friends

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.866
is going to that underground
trash heap for good.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.600
(thinking)
I must win for my fans to show
them dreams can come true.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.433
It is most unfortunate that
I will be sentencing her

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:26.833
to a life of hard labor.

00:03:26.833 --> 00:03:29.566
I'm sorry, young lady.

00:03:29.566 --> 00:03:31.800
Excuse me?

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.033
(thinking)
What's he apologizing for?

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:38.000
Let's fire up
the Action Field...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.666
Crossover Acceleration!

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:44.733
(computer voice)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:47.566
<i>Autopilot activated.</i>

00:03:47.566 --> 00:03:49.166
(Melissa)
<i>On your mark...</i>

00:03:49.166 --> 00:03:50.733
<i>get set...</i>

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:53.100
<i>Go!</i>

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.533
Aah!

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:56.166
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:03:56.166 --> 00:04:00.033
Ugh! She needs some
training wheels!

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:02.633
(thinking)
How am I gonna drive and duel

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:06.666
when the only driving I'm used
to is Yuya driving me nuts!

00:04:06.666 --> 00:04:10.866
(Melissa)
As our dukin' duelists speed
out of the first turn,

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:13.466
it's Hero Chojiro
who takes the lead!

00:04:13.466 --> 00:04:15.400
That means he goes first!

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.400
My humble apologies,
but I must win.

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.466
From my hand I summon
Flower Cardian Pine!

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:27.533
I activate Flower Cardian Pine
with Crane's special ability!

00:04:27.533 --> 00:04:30.266
It knocks my old card
to the curb.

00:04:30.266 --> 00:04:33.500
Since Pine with Crane was
successfully summoned,

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.466
I draw another card!

00:04:35.466 --> 00:04:39.933
But since it's not a Cardian,
I send it to my graveyard.

00:04:39.933 --> 00:04:42.000
And now it's your turn,
young lady.

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:46.800
It's time for Miss Boyle
to battle!

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.900
(thinking) I hope Yuya's well
enough to watch my debut duel.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.566
Here I go!

00:04:52.566 --> 00:04:54.866
Since you have a monster,
but I don't,

00:04:54.866 --> 00:04:57.233
I'm allowed to summon
the sweet sounding

00:04:57.233 --> 00:05:00.500
Solo the Melodious Songstress.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.933
She might not be allowed
to attack this turn,

00:05:02.933 --> 00:05:05.433
but joining the stage is
the dynamic and dangerous

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.266
Opera the Melodious Diva!

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:10.433
(Melissa)
Zuzu's first moves sound a
little out of tune!

00:05:10.433 --> 00:05:13.400
First she summons a monster
which has fewer attack
points

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.933
than Chojiro's
Pine with Crane.

00:05:14.933 --> 00:05:17.600
Then she summons a diva that
has more attack points

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.000
<i>but can't attack!</i>

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.066
I activate Fortissimo!

00:05:22.066 --> 00:05:25.133
This power‐packed spell gives
Solo the Melodious Songstress

00:05:25.133 --> 00:05:28.766
600 extra attack points until
the next turn!

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:31.666
And that's music to my
Songstress' ears!

00:05:34.666 --> 00:05:36.400
Let's go!

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:40.566
Solo the Melodious Songstress,
take out Pine with Crane!

00:05:43.766 --> 00:05:46.833
Now that's what I can
a number one hit!

00:05:46.833 --> 00:05:49.433
More like a one‐hit wonder.

00:05:49.433 --> 00:05:51.333
Be careful.

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:53.700
That's it for now.
I end my turn.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:55.133
Not bad.

00:05:55.133 --> 00:05:57.300
That's why...
I'm so sorry.

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.266
He's apologizing again.

00:05:59.266 --> 00:06:00.600
I wonder why.

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.300
I draw.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.800
And I activate the spell card
Recardination!

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:10.166
It allows me to summon
one Cardian monster
from my graveyard!

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:13.633
Bloom again, Flower Cardian
Pine with Crane!

00:06:13.633 --> 00:06:17.266
And now I activate the spell
card Sneaky Sleeve!

00:06:17.266 --> 00:06:20.333
My Flower Cardian's level
blossoms to two.

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:23.566
Then I draw one card
from my deck.

00:06:23.566 --> 00:06:25.133
(thinking)
If I draw the card I need,

00:06:25.133 --> 00:06:27.266
it's the beginning of the end
for her.

00:06:27.266 --> 00:06:29.133
But I must have the courage
to play it.

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:31.133
I draw!

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.300
I'm sorry!

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.933
I'm sorry
that you're sorry?

00:06:36.933 --> 00:06:40.200
I activate the spell
Super Koi Koi!

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.433
Game over.

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:44.233
That's the card that almost
slammed Yuya permanently

00:06:44.233 --> 00:06:45.833
in their showdown
in the slammer.

00:06:45.833 --> 00:06:47.633
Zuzu.

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:50.700
I will now draw three cards!

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:52.700
If any of them are
Flower Cardian's,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:55.300
I can then summon them!

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.166
But if they're not, I have to
send them to the graveyard,

00:06:58.166 --> 00:07:01.900
and I take 1,000 points
of damage for each card.

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:04.833
But that is a risk
well worth taking.

00:07:04.833 --> 00:07:06.400
I draw!

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:08.566
Yes! I drew the card!

00:07:08.566 --> 00:07:10.033
(groaning)

00:07:10.033 --> 00:07:11.266
The second card.

00:07:11.266 --> 00:07:12.866
Will I go two for two?

00:07:12.866 --> 00:07:15.833
Yes, a second Cardian.

00:07:15.833 --> 00:07:17.433
(crowd gasps)

00:07:17.433 --> 00:07:20.366
And card number three!

00:07:20.366 --> 00:07:22.300
Aah!

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:24.833
A Cardian indeed.

00:07:24.833 --> 00:07:27.133
Well, rock my socks!

00:07:27.133 --> 00:07:29.900
Hero Chojiro has just gone
three for three!

00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.333
That's right!
I did it!

00:07:32.333 --> 00:07:34.966
Hero Chojiro is back!

00:07:34.966 --> 00:07:37.033
Due to Super Koi Koi's effect,

00:07:37.033 --> 00:07:40.133
as these three Flower Cardians
bloom on my field,

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:43.366
their attack points drop to zero
and become Level 2.

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:46.033
That may sound terrible
to your ears,

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:48.566
but this is great news for me

00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:50.633
because I'm now allowed
to tune them.

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:55.433
Behold, dueling at its
very best.

00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.733
Dueling at its most powerful.

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:00.700
I Synchro Summon.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.166
Rise, Level 8 Flower Cardian
Lightshower!

00:08:06.933 --> 00:08:09.100
(cheering)

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.633
And now...

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:15.000
Lightshower, rain down on Solo
the Melodious Songstress!

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.433
Oh, no.
I'm done for.

00:08:21.366 --> 00:08:25.033
Lightshower, rain down on Solo
the Melodious Songstress!

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:27.300
This doesn't look good.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:28.300
Huh?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.666
But that does!

00:08:29.666 --> 00:08:30.666
An Action Card.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.033
I'm playing this!

00:08:36.033 --> 00:08:38.433
The Action Card Take Flight!

00:08:38.433 --> 00:08:42.466
My Songstress' attack points
soar by 600!

00:08:42.466 --> 00:08:43.800
Huh.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.633
I thought that was gonna be
Zuzu's swan song,

00:08:46.633 --> 00:08:48.600
but it looks like she's just
getting warmed up!

00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:50.366
Excuse me!

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:56.300
Oh, no!

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.500
Talk about a chart‐toppin'
move!

00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.766
Way to put the "zu"
in zoom, Zuzu!

00:09:03.766 --> 00:09:07.366
I snagged...
another Take Flight!

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:10.033
So my Songstress' attack points
take off again!

00:09:10.033 --> 00:09:12.566
(Melissa)
Zuzu's Songstress is now
stronger

00:09:12.566 --> 00:09:14.200
than Chojiro's
Lightshower!

00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.033
Oh, yeah? Well, two
can play at that game!

00:09:17.033 --> 00:09:18.100
Gotcha!

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:20.000
(giggles)

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.433
I play the Action Spell
Miracle!

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:26.566
My monster's safe, and it cuts
the damage I take in half.

00:09:29.333 --> 00:09:31.400
Impressive, young lady.

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:33.100
You really know how to
hang tough.

00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:36.300
When I duel,
I duel for one reason...

00:09:36.300 --> 00:09:37.900
To wow the crowd!

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.966
I admire the fire
in your eyes.

00:09:40.966 --> 00:09:44.133
It is a shame that
I must... extinguish it.

00:09:44.133 --> 00:09:45.333
Huh?

00:09:45.333 --> 00:09:49.900
Once you draw, Lightshower deals
1,500 points of damage!

00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:52.766
Sorry, but losing
is in the cards.

00:09:52.766 --> 00:09:57.900
(Melissa)Looks like Zuzu's
been hogtied into dealing
herself damage.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.866
I may be down,
but whatever happens,

00:10:00.866 --> 00:10:02.866
I'll keep on fighting...

00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:04.366
all the way!

00:10:04.366 --> 00:10:06.300
That girl's sure got guts.

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.366
(Chojiro)
As promised, Lightshower deals
you 1,500 points of damage!

00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:16.066
I admire you for
not giving up.

00:10:16.066 --> 00:10:18.533
Just what is it
that keeps you going?

00:10:18.533 --> 00:10:20.900
I'm sending a message
to someone.

00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:22.266
A friend.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:27.733
I know he's feeling pretty
down, for losing his duel.

00:10:27.733 --> 00:10:30.700
But he has to remember
why he duels.

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:32.900
<i>He duels to dueltain!</i>

00:10:32.900 --> 00:10:34.966
And I want to remind him,

00:10:34.966 --> 00:10:38.500
that for us dueltainers,
it's always showtime!

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:41.300
It's time I take
center stage!

00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.466
(gasps)

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:47.266
That sounds oddly familiar!

00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:50.033
And it's time I take
center stage!

00:10:50.033 --> 00:10:51.300
Oh, my!

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:52.933
Could this be the young lady

00:10:52.933 --> 00:10:55.666
that Yuya's been looking for?

00:10:55.666 --> 00:10:57.733
Now I'll tribute this duet

00:10:57.733 --> 00:10:59.933
and combine them to summon a
whole new monster!

00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:03.566
She'll blow you away with her
musical talent.

00:11:03.566 --> 00:11:05.866
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:11:05.866 --> 00:11:07.700
Magically appearing in their
place

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.166
is Mozarta the Melodious
Maestra!

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.500
By hitting the perfect note,

00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:20.100
her special ability lets me
summon another Melodious Diva!

00:11:22.633 --> 00:11:24.633
Aria the Melodious Diva,

00:11:24.633 --> 00:11:26.933
let your voice ring loud and
proud for all to hear!

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.466
Zuzu's putting on a show
for the ages.

00:11:34.466 --> 00:11:38.166
This act's got me singing the
blues and seeing red!

00:11:38.166 --> 00:11:39.400
On with the show!

00:11:39.400 --> 00:11:41.600
Thanks to the spell Fortissimo,

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.333
Mozarta the Melodious Maestra
gets an extra 600 attack points!

00:11:49.266 --> 00:11:51.900
And with more points
comes more pizzazz!

00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.466
Check out Mozarta's new
glittering, glamorous gown!

00:11:55.466 --> 00:11:57.766
This Zuzu duels with style!

00:11:57.766 --> 00:12:00.333
She's so got
the glam to slam.

00:12:00.333 --> 00:12:02.000
Zuzu!

00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.433
There's no doubt who this
crowd's rooting for!

00:12:04.433 --> 00:12:07.000
Zuzu!
Show 'em how it's done!

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:11.066
Mozarta, bring down the house
with your most powerful strain!

00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:14.433
Get set to belt one out!

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.700
Zuzu...

00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:18.233
You're a hit.

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:20.400
I can be...

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.966
entertaining, too, you know?

00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:24.633
Aah!

00:12:24.633 --> 00:12:26.100
(crowd gasps)

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.800
(Zuzu)
Graceful Wave!

00:12:32.066 --> 00:12:35.000
I play... Evasion!

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.400
To duck your monster's attack!

00:12:38.666 --> 00:12:40.200
(Melissa)
<i>What a move, y'all!</i>

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:42.133
Amazing dueltaining.

00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:44.133
Yuya would be proud!

00:12:44.133 --> 00:12:47.566
(thinking)
He knows Yuya!

00:12:47.566 --> 00:12:52.266
Hey, between us, I'm a huge
fan of your performance so far.

00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:53.500
What else you got?

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.866
Any more musical moves?

00:12:55.866 --> 00:12:58.566
Since my Aria missed
her attack before,

00:12:58.566 --> 00:13:00.700
she can use her special ability

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:03.433
to reduce your life points
by 800!

00:13:03.433 --> 00:13:04.866
Resonating Wave!

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.966
How's that?

00:13:12.966 --> 00:13:15.366
Does it give you a case of the
goosepickles?

00:13:15.366 --> 00:13:17.033
(both laughing)

00:13:17.033 --> 00:13:20.100
(thinking)
You're watching, right, Yuya?

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:21.766
Huh?

00:13:21.766 --> 00:13:24.200
(Zuzu)
You're not alone, ever.

00:13:29.666 --> 00:13:31.466
<i>Now hear this!</i>

00:13:31.466 --> 00:13:33.700
I activate the spell
Piping Pipes

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:37.300
and equip it onto Mozarta the
Melodious Maestra!

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:41.866
This spell shuts down damage

00:13:41.866 --> 00:13:43.533
from your monster's special
ability,

00:13:43.533 --> 00:13:45.366
and my Mozarta gains
the same number

00:13:45.366 --> 00:13:47.300
of attack points
that it blocks!

00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.666
What the what?

00:13:48.666 --> 00:13:50.366
Pretty sweet!

00:13:50.366 --> 00:13:53.966
Zuzu won't be taking any more
damage from Lightshower now.

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:56.833
I end my turn!

00:13:56.833 --> 00:13:58.666
Hmph.

00:13:58.666 --> 00:13:59.933
I'm up!

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:05.000
I play...

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.133
Super All In which returns
Lightshower to my Extra Deck!

00:14:08.133 --> 00:14:10.633
Now for the real entertainment!

00:14:10.633 --> 00:14:13.000
I'm bringing back all the
monsters I used

00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.966
to Synchro Summon Lightshower!

00:14:14.966 --> 00:14:18.000
Come back, Flower Cardian Pine
with Crane,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.566
Zebragrass with Moon,

00:14:19.566 --> 00:14:23.633
Paulownia with Phoenix and
Willow with Calligrapher!

00:14:23.633 --> 00:14:26.900
And now, I draw one card.

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.700
And if it's a Flower Cardian,

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:31.900
then I can summon another
Level 2 monster!

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.766
However, if it's
not a Cardian,

00:14:34.766 --> 00:14:37.366
all of the monsters on
my field are destroyed,

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.533
and I lose half of my life
points.

00:14:39.533 --> 00:14:42.533
This is a huge gamble for
Chojiro!

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:44.533
If he don't get
the card he needs,

00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:47.466
his goose is as good
as cooked!

00:14:51.466 --> 00:14:54.233
This is a huge gamble for
Chojiro!

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:56.233
If he don't get
the card he needs,

00:14:56.233 --> 00:14:58.666
his goose is as good
as cooked!

00:14:58.666 --> 00:15:00.566
On with the show.

00:15:01.833 --> 00:15:03.833
(thinking)
It all comes down to this draw.

00:15:03.833 --> 00:15:06.733
Let us see what fate has decided
for our futures.

00:15:06.733 --> 00:15:07.733
I draw!

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:14.900
I'm so sorry, Zuzu!

00:15:16.333 --> 00:15:19.066
I drew Flower Cardian Cherry
Blossom with Curtain!

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:27.400
That makes five
Level 2 Flower Cardians.

00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:30.100
Level 2 Willow with
Calligrapher

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.500
tunes Level 2 Flower Cardian
Cherry Blossom with Curtain,

00:15:33.500 --> 00:15:35.866
Pine with Crane,
Zebragrass with Moon

00:15:35.866 --> 00:15:39.366
and Paulownia with Phoenix!

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:46.166
Behold, as five blinding beams
become one beacon of light!

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:48.400
I Synchro Summon...

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.933
Flower Cardian Lightflare!

00:15:55.633 --> 00:15:57.966
5,000 attack points!

00:15:57.966 --> 00:16:02.466
If Lightflare attacks Aria, all
your life points will be gone!

00:16:02.466 --> 00:16:04.066
That's true.

00:16:04.066 --> 00:16:06.033
But thanks to Piping Pipes's
effect,

00:16:06.033 --> 00:16:09.400
you're only allowed to attack
Mozarta!

00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:10.633
I am?

00:16:10.633 --> 00:16:13.500
All right, but your Maestra's
getting the hook!

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:14.733
Sorry!

00:16:14.733 --> 00:16:16.333
Lightflare!

00:16:16.333 --> 00:16:18.466
Take out Mozarta!

00:16:21.033 --> 00:16:22.333
An Action Card!

00:16:31.066 --> 00:16:32.333
(crowd cheering)

00:16:32.333 --> 00:16:34.900
Now I activate Overpass!

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.166
When our monsters battle, they
swap their attack points!

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:41.366
That's a super switcheroo!

00:16:41.366 --> 00:16:45.033
I activate Lightflare's
special ability!

00:16:45.033 --> 00:16:47.700
It stops your spell card
from being activated

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:50.933
and slices it to pieces!

00:16:50.933 --> 00:16:52.233
Oh, no.

00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:54.833
Destroy Mozarta!

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:03.300
Since Flower Cardian Lightflare
negates all of your spells,

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:06.066
grabbing Action Cards cannot
help you out anymore

00:17:06.066 --> 00:17:07.966
for the rest of this duel!

00:17:07.966 --> 00:17:11.333
Making a comeback just got
a whole lot harder.

00:17:11.333 --> 00:17:13.133
(Melissa)
Zuzu's turnaround just turned
around again,

00:17:13.133 --> 00:17:15.866
and she's in trouble with a
capital "T"!

00:17:15.866 --> 00:17:20.900
Well I'm gonna turn this "T"
into a "W".

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:23.400
It's time to floor this crowd!

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.033
My turn!

00:17:25.033 --> 00:17:28.400
(shouting)

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:31.766
I summon Soprano the Melodious
Songstress!

00:17:31.766 --> 00:17:34.033
My Soprano's special ability

00:17:34.033 --> 00:17:37.566
lets me Fusion Summon without
using Polymerization

00:17:37.566 --> 00:17:39.166
Lucky.

00:17:39.166 --> 00:17:41.300
Seems this duel hung on that
draw,

00:17:41.300 --> 00:17:43.266
and you got just what you
needed.

00:17:43.266 --> 00:17:45.400
I fuse Aria the Melodious Diva

00:17:45.400 --> 00:17:47.700
with Soprano the Melodious
Songstress!

00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:50.200
Together you'll sing a
sensational duet

00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:54.200
that will form an even more
melodious monster!

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.600
I Fusion Summon!

00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:59.633
Blossom in the spotlight with
a song of victory,

00:17:59.633 --> 00:18:03.500
Bloom Diva the Melodious Choir!

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.866
♪ La la la la ♪

00:18:08.466 --> 00:18:10.466
She can Fusion Summon.

00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:12.533
My, my.

00:18:12.533 --> 00:18:14.366
Bloom Diva!

00:18:14.366 --> 00:18:16.633
Belt one out and attack his
Lightflare!

00:18:16.633 --> 00:18:18.533
Is Zuzu insane?!

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:21.166
Why would she have a monster
with 1,000 attack points

00:18:21.166 --> 00:18:23.633
take on one with
5,000 attack points?

00:18:23.633 --> 00:18:26.300
'Cause this card can't be
destroyed in battle,

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.900
and Chojiro takes the damage
that I would have taken instead,

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.200
plus his monster is destroyed!

00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.566
It's over!

00:18:33.566 --> 00:18:35.733
No, it is not!

00:18:35.733 --> 00:18:39.266
Lightflare also shuts down
the special abilities
of the monster it's battling!

00:18:39.266 --> 00:18:43.033
(Melissa)
It looks like Zuzu's strategy
to save herself fell flat

00:18:43.033 --> 00:18:45.266
and Chohijro's
still on top!

00:18:45.266 --> 00:18:47.500
Not for long!

00:18:53.800 --> 00:18:55.900
Aah!

00:18:58.466 --> 00:18:59.833
Why did she grab that?

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:04.766
(thinking)
Here I go.

00:19:04.766 --> 00:19:07.300
I play the Action Spell
Overpass!

00:19:07.300 --> 00:19:09.033
Didn't I tell you already

00:19:09.033 --> 00:19:12.100
that you can't play spells
against me?

00:19:16.633 --> 00:19:19.333
I'm wondering if that
helmet's too tight,

00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:20.833
'cause Zuzu should know by now

00:19:20.833 --> 00:19:23.266
that there's no point
in playing Action Cards.

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:25.400
It's over, young lady.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:27.100
No, it's just
getting started.

00:19:27.100 --> 00:19:28.233
Say what?

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:31.066
I send Score the Melodious Diva
to the graveyard

00:19:31.066 --> 00:19:33.266
to activate her special ability!

00:19:33.266 --> 00:19:35.933
By banishing two copies of
the same spell card,

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:38.466
I can activate its effect!

00:19:38.466 --> 00:19:40.333
(growling)

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:44.000
Overpass, do your thing and lay
down the road to victory!

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:46.966
♪ La la la la la ♪

00:19:46.966 --> 00:19:49.300
And your Lightflare's
special ability

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:51.866
can do nothing to stop this!

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:55.066
Due to Overpass' effect,
when our monsters battle,

00:19:55.066 --> 00:19:57.300
their attack points are swapped!

00:20:00.666 --> 00:20:02.400
Bloom Diva!

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:05.000
Wrecking Refrain!

00:20:08.066 --> 00:20:10.066
Aah!

00:20:12.033 --> 00:20:13.733
(Melissa)
<i>It's over!</i>

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:17.400
In one of the most shocking,
come from‐behind victories ever,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:20.933
<i>Zuzu has won this duel!</i>

00:20:22.566 --> 00:20:23.800
I won.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:25.400
Zuzu!

00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:30.100
You did it, Zuzu.

00:20:30.100 --> 00:20:32.066
Way to duel.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.533
Congratulations, young lady.

00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:39.366
Thank you.

00:20:39.366 --> 00:20:42.133
Do you...
So you know my friend Yuya?

00:20:42.133 --> 00:20:46.800
I suspect he's more
than just a friend.

00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.066
Aah!
Uhh!

00:20:49.066 --> 00:20:51.266
Now, I'm sorry.
(giggles)

00:20:51.266 --> 00:20:52.466
(crowd cheering)

00:20:52.466 --> 00:20:53.500
You're still our hero!

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:54.866
You still got it!
You're no zero!

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:58.000
A duel is the same as life,
my friends!

00:20:59.966 --> 00:21:01.566
Some days, you win,

00:21:01.566 --> 00:21:03.400
some days, you lose.

00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:06.800
What's important is to enjoy
the journey!

00:21:09.466 --> 00:21:11.100
Huh?

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.333
Now, I must go.

00:21:17.366 --> 00:21:19.400
Chojiro.

00:21:23.066 --> 00:21:25.266
(thinking)
Well, Yuya, I hope this duel

00:21:25.266 --> 00:21:29.166
makes you want to swing into
action.

00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:31.866
Thanks, Zuzu.
You were awesome.

00:21:33.533 --> 00:21:36.933
I hope I can be awesome,
just like you are.
