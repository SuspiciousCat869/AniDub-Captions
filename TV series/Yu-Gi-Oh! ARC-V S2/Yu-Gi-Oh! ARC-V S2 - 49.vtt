(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.633
(Melissa)
Jack just jackhammered
all of Sector Security

00:00:07.633 --> 00:00:10.700
with one blast from his
Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.000
And now, Yuya's in the line
of fire!

00:00:15.366 --> 00:00:16.900
I used this
Action Spell

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.833
to zip past
your flames, Jack.

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:19.733
Yay!
Yay!

00:00:19.733 --> 00:00:21.266
Yeah!
Yuya made it!

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:23.433
Hurry up and make
your move.

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:25.400
I mean
your dad's move...

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.766
Unless of course you have
the guts to be your own man!

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.133
(Yuya)
There's a monster
I can Synchro Summon

00:00:31.133 --> 00:00:33.100
only after I Pendulum Summon!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.866
This is something unique
that only I can do!

00:00:35.866 --> 00:00:37.833
Unbelievable!

00:00:37.833 --> 00:00:40.400
Now I Synchro Summon!

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.333
Nirvana High Paladin!

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:45.433
Aah!

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:47.733
Elysium Elimination!

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.633
Well done.

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.833
You're taking dueltaining
and Pendulum Summoning,

00:00:55.833 --> 00:00:58.233
the very best
of both worlds,

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.033
and combining the two
of them into one.

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:02.900
So that's
what Jack meant...

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900
that I was only copying
what my dad was doing,

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.366
not really learning
and weaving it

00:01:07.366 --> 00:01:08.800
into my own style.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.200
That's just what
I'm gonna do!

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.566
My monsters are ready...

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:16.333
to swing
into action!

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:21.900
Get ready, 'cause I've saved
the best for last!

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.033

(Melissa)
Jack summoned his Tyrant
Red Dragon Archfiend early on

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.933
and he's giving Yuya
a schooling!

00:02:30.933 --> 00:02:33.333
By contrast,
the team Yuya assembled

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.233
looks downright
pre‐school!

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:36.566
Time to use
what I've learned

00:02:36.566 --> 00:02:39.400
from all my friends and family
and win this duel!

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.900
Here's a card
that's guaranteed

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.433
to turn Jack's frown
upside down.

00:02:45.433 --> 00:02:48.366
Even your Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend is gonna crack

00:02:48.366 --> 00:02:50.933
a smile when it gets
a power‐up...

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:52.900
Well, maybe not.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.966
But those 600 extra attack
points certainly have turned

00:02:55.966 --> 00:02:58.933
my troupe into a group
of grinners and winners!

00:02:58.933 --> 00:03:01.466
And I'll follow that move
by having Radish Horse

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.400
veg out by using
its special ability!

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.466
Watch it take
1,100 attack points

00:03:06.466 --> 00:03:08.733
from Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:10.433
and toss 'em over to Odd‐Eyes,
to give

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.133
my Pendulum Dragon
a massive power infusion!

00:03:14.433 --> 00:03:16.866
See? Veggies do
make you stronger!

00:03:16.866 --> 00:03:19.966
Stronger than Jack Atlas's
Dragon, that's for sure!

00:03:19.966 --> 00:03:22.966
And now Yuya can rally
all his monsters and win this!

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:25.933
Yes! The finish line
is in his sights!

00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:27.800
How disconcerting!

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.866
Jack better
pull it together!

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:33.433
I activate the trap
Over the Red!

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:35.733
Since my Tyrant lost
attack points,

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:37.733
this card doubles
its remaining ones

00:03:37.733 --> 00:03:40.100
until the end
of this turn!

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.100
Then by banishing Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.500
I can add its attack points
to my Tyrant as well!

00:03:53.366 --> 00:03:55.900
(Melissa) Well, flip
me like a flapjack!

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.966
Look at all those
attack points!

00:03:57.966 --> 00:03:59.400
It's incredible...

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.966
He must've learned
how to duel by watching me.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.966
Only if his eyes
were closed.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:07.866
I'm the best of the best,
and I aim to stay that way!

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.600
You haven't buckled yet,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600
but if you want to knock
this King from his top spot,

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:14.533
you've got to show
some more backbone!

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:18.166
Let's see if you can stand up to
the heat of my fiery friend!

00:04:21.766 --> 00:04:24.700
Oh, I will, Jack.
That's a guarantee!

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.733
And I'll take
what my dad taught me,

00:04:26.733 --> 00:04:29.966
and what I learned
from everyone around me...

00:04:29.966 --> 00:04:33.266
and take my game
to a whole new level!

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:35.600
Aah! Is he off
his rocker?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.100
You're up next,
Nirvana High Paladin!

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:41.933
Use your Pendulum ability
on Timebreaker Magician!

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.966
So Timebreaker Magician
can no longer be destroyed,

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:47.233
plus I won't take any damage!

00:04:47.233 --> 00:04:49.400
All right,
go Timebreaker!

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:52.266
Attack Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:04:52.266 --> 00:04:55.033
That monster's too puny
to take on Tyrant!

00:04:55.033 --> 00:04:57.233
It looks like
an itty‐bitty fruit fly

00:04:57.233 --> 00:04:59.533
trying to take down
a grizzly bear!

00:05:03.033 --> 00:05:05.433
It's true my guy
won't win this battle,

00:05:05.433 --> 00:05:07.066
but Nirvana's effect
on Timebreaker

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:08.500
hasn't fully
played out yet.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.800
See, once it's done fighting,
it weakens your Dragon!

00:05:14.433 --> 00:05:16.900
(Terron)
2,000 attack points gone!
Not bad!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.433
Yes, but in terms
of pure power,

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:22.933
Jack's Tyrant still
has a tyrannical advantage!

00:05:25.333 --> 00:05:27.633
I thought you were bringing
your A‐game today,

00:05:27.633 --> 00:05:30.533
but you and your monsters
have flunked miserably!

00:05:30.533 --> 00:05:33.133
We'll make the grade,
just wait and see!

00:05:33.133 --> 00:05:36.266
We've been saving
the very best for last!

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:38.166
It's showtime!

00:05:38.166 --> 00:05:40.400
You tell 'em,
Yuya!
Hey, Crow!

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.033
Thought you should know
that your duel

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:44.700
has brought the whole city
to a standstill.

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:46.733
All the crazy chaos
has calmed down

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:49.400
and you're about
to have plenty of company!

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.700
Who has time
to fight

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:52.700
when the duel of
the century is going on?

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:54.266
Win this one for me,
buddy!

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:57.666
All right...
You got it!

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:03.200
Now get set,
let's keep the party going!

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:05.900
And what's a party without
some surprises?

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.100
Nirvana High Paladin
can use

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.166
its Pendulum ability
on another monster.

00:06:10.166 --> 00:06:11.633
This time,
swing it onto one

00:06:11.633 --> 00:06:14.433
that's a Level higher
than Timebreaker Magician.

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:19.000
Let's hoof it,
Radish Horse!

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.800
Use your noggin and knock
that Dragon for a loop!

00:06:25.433 --> 00:06:27.000
(beeping)

00:06:29.266 --> 00:06:32.000
(Duel Chaser 227)
If enjoying this duel
is a crime,

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.566
then lock me up
and throw away the key!

00:06:35.566 --> 00:06:37.900
What do you say to the long arm
of the law

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:40.366
giving these two VIPs
an escort?

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.333
(all shouting)

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:45.066
I've got some more
ba‐aad news for you

00:06:45.066 --> 00:06:46.766
because now Nirvana
High Paladin's

00:06:46.766 --> 00:06:49.733
effect bounces over
to Performapal Gumgumouton!

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:51.166
I bet once it attacks,

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:53.333
Mouton's not as sheepish
as it looks!

00:06:53.333 --> 00:06:55.366
(all giggling)

00:06:55.366 --> 00:06:56.466
Right!

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:59.133
Let it rip, Gumgumouton!

00:06:59.133 --> 00:07:01.833
Ram that Tyrant
with all your might!

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.833
It's getting weaker
and weaker!

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:09.466
Yuya's monsters just keep
hammering away!

00:07:09.466 --> 00:07:11.833
Well, Gong do declare.
This is the most

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.533
pendulumtainin' duel
Gong's ever seen!

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:17.300
Yuya sure did save
the best for last.

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:19.666
It certainly
is a moving moment!

00:07:19.666 --> 00:07:21.800
Oh, I'm so honored!

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:23.600
He's dueling
just like me.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.633
A move this special deserves
to be named

00:07:25.633 --> 00:07:28.333
by someone only as special
as me and no one else.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:30.500
I'm going to call it...

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.533
The Pendulum Pummeler!

00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.566
Huh?

00:07:36.433 --> 00:07:39.900
(Yuya)
Bubblebowwow,
it's over to you!

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:42.200
Give that Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.466
a good scrubbing!

00:07:46.566 --> 00:07:48.166
Sic 'im,
Bubblebowwow!

00:07:48.166 --> 00:07:50.300
That's one powerhouse pooch!

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.200
Keep it going, Yuya!

00:07:52.200 --> 00:07:53.233
Hang in there,
buddy!

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:56.566
Huh?
What's going on down there?

00:07:56.566 --> 00:07:57.700
Aah!

00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:59.900
Hovering hamsters!

00:07:59.900 --> 00:08:02.066
Somebody better call a doc,
'cause our fair city

00:08:02.066 --> 00:08:04.333
is suffering
some major congestion!

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:06.033
Folks are gathering
from all over

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:07.466
to watch the big duel!

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:10.266
Supervisor Lazar, are you
enjoying the match?

00:08:10.266 --> 00:08:12.200
I hope the view
is to your liking.

00:08:14.066 --> 00:08:15.266
The view is okay,

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:17.600
but the match is taking
my breath away.

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:19.800
I haven't seen
a good win in ages

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.666
and I know I won't
come away disappointed.

00:08:26.566 --> 00:08:28.433
Very clever!

00:08:28.433 --> 00:08:31.966
You used your moves to send
a message to the whole city!

00:08:31.966 --> 00:08:34.333
None of those four monsters
were especially strong

00:08:34.333 --> 00:08:37.000
by themselves,
but by working together

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.033
they made a huge impact!
That's just what'll happen

00:08:40.033 --> 00:08:42.133
in New Domino
if people pull together!

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:44.633
You've proven yourself
a worthy adversary,

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:47.666
but you still have to prove
you can beat me!

00:08:56.766 --> 00:08:59.000
Ha!
All right, Yuya!

00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:00.766
It all comes down
to this.

00:09:00.766 --> 00:09:03.300
Time to find out
who will reign supreme!

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:05.866
You got it!
Here I go!

00:09:08.566 --> 00:09:12.133
My friends,
here comes the grand finale!

00:09:12.133 --> 00:09:13.866
(cheering)

00:09:15.033 --> 00:09:17.933
That's just what
I wanted to hear!

00:09:17.933 --> 00:09:21.333
My monsters from Levels three
to six have all attacked.

00:09:21.333 --> 00:09:23.233
<i>So that leaves...</i>

00:09:23.233 --> 00:09:24.300
(all)
Seven!

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.933
<i>Right you are!</i>

00:09:25.933 --> 00:09:28.533
The last monster
of my troupe to attack

00:09:28.533 --> 00:09:31.966
will be my Level Seven
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:09:31.966 --> 00:09:34.866
Go ahead, Yuya!
Attack away!

00:09:34.866 --> 00:09:37.833
(crowd chanting)
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:40.766
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!

00:09:40.766 --> 00:09:44.966
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!

00:09:44.966 --> 00:09:48.033
(Melissa)
Folks, I can feel
the electricity!

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:51.466
The whole city has rallied
behind Yuya!

00:09:51.466 --> 00:09:53.333
This is so cool.

00:09:53.333 --> 00:09:54.700
I never thought
this day would come.

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.700
Huh?

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.966
The city is now one...

00:09:57.966 --> 00:10:00.400
and we're finally together
having some fun,

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:02.866
and it's all thanks
to the bestest dueltainer

00:10:02.866 --> 00:10:05.133
there ever was, Yuya!

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:09.800
Ready, my friends?

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.766
Let's bring this
to an end together!

00:10:11.766 --> 00:10:13.433
(all)
We're with you, Yuya!

00:10:13.433 --> 00:10:16.433
Odd‐Eyes...
Pendulum Dragon!

00:10:16.433 --> 00:10:18.400
Attack Tyrant...

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:20.166
Red Dragon...

00:10:20.166 --> 00:10:21.600
Archfiend!

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.166
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:10:25.566 --> 00:10:29.300
And now, it's the end
of the show, Jack...

00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:32.000
And the curtain falls
on you!

00:10:39.333 --> 00:10:40.933
That's a wrap!

00:10:40.933 --> 00:10:44.800
(Melissa)
The Friendship Cup has
a new champion, Yuya Sakaki!

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.400
With his powerful combination
of Pendulum Summoning

00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:48.966
<i>and dueltaining pizzazz,</i>

00:10:48.966 --> 00:10:51.333
this amazing duelist
has not only captured

00:10:51.333 --> 00:10:53.566
New Domino City's
top dueling prize,

00:10:53.566 --> 00:10:56.200
he's captured
our hearts as well!

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:57.733
(all)
Yeah!

00:10:57.733 --> 00:10:59.666
(cheering)

00:10:59.666 --> 00:11:03.566
(crowd chanting)
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!
Yuya! Yuya!

00:11:03.566 --> 00:11:04.633
Ha ha!

00:11:04.633 --> 00:11:05.566
(children)
Oh yeah!

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:09.533
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!
Yuya! Yuya!

00:11:09.533 --> 00:11:13.566
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!

00:11:13.566 --> 00:11:15.600
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!
(Gong sobbing)

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.133
Gong so happy...

00:11:22.466 --> 00:11:24.266
(chuckling)

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:43.333
You dueled great,
Jack.

00:11:43.333 --> 00:11:45.433
There's nothing great
about losing.

00:11:45.433 --> 00:11:48.300
(stammering)
Sorry, Jack!

00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:50.333
You may have been
the better man today.

00:11:50.333 --> 00:11:51.466
But that doesn't mean

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:53.633
you'll be the better man
tomorrow.

00:11:53.633 --> 00:11:54.766
Oh, well.

00:11:54.766 --> 00:11:57.466
I relinquish my crown
to you, for now.

00:11:57.466 --> 00:12:00.933
But believe me,
I'll regain it soon enough.

00:12:02.133 --> 00:12:05.200
I certainly had my doubts...
(chuckling)

00:12:05.200 --> 00:12:09.033
but I'll give this battle
a two‐star performance.

00:12:09.033 --> 00:12:11.433
Thanks! Beats zero stars
for sure.

00:12:11.433 --> 00:12:13.833
Dueling you was
the ultimate blast.

00:12:13.833 --> 00:12:16.266
It looks like the rest
of the city agrees.

00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:20.433
And next time I'm gonna get
a four out of four!

00:12:20.433 --> 00:12:22.700
Today is a great day.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.500
The only way it could have
been better is if I had won.

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:27.400
But it wasn't
meant to be.

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.300
You all have
a new champion,

00:12:29.300 --> 00:12:32.666
so let's give him
his 15 minutes of fame.

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:34.733
Let's hear it for
Yuya, New Domino City!

00:12:34.733 --> 00:12:36.266
<i>He earned it today!</i>

00:12:36.266 --> 00:12:39.866
(all cheering)

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:46.266
(Gale)Jack and Yuya, stay where
you are and do not move!

00:12:54.033 --> 00:12:55.333
It's the council.

00:12:55.333 --> 00:12:56.700
Wonder what
those windbags want?

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.833
The High Council sure knows
how to get our attention.

00:12:59.833 --> 00:13:03.400
My fellow citizens, now
that our Friendship Cup

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.633
has reachedits
exhilarating conclusion,

00:13:05.633 --> 00:13:08.266
the council has deemed
thisan ideal moment

00:13:08.266 --> 00:13:11.433
to announce some momentous
newsfor the whole city!

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:14.500
The Friendship Cup was
founded to encourage harmony

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:16.766
between Topsiders
and Commons.

00:13:16.766 --> 00:13:18.933
Each year, the city
would hold a tournament

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:21.833
to determine the most
powerful duelist among the
people.

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.766
(White)
The winner,
whether Topsider or Commons,

00:13:24.766 --> 00:13:27.966
would be crowned champion.
And that champion would
serve

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:29.766
as a symbol to
all our city

00:13:29.766 --> 00:13:32.466
that opportunity exists
for all who live here.

00:13:32.466 --> 00:13:34.833
We believed this
systemwas working,

00:13:34.833 --> 00:13:37.000
benefiting Topsiderand
Common alike.

00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.500
Instead of bringing
the people together,

00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.433
we may have
unintentionally torn

00:13:41.433 --> 00:13:43.733
the good people
of New Domino apart.

00:13:43.733 --> 00:13:45.433
(Azul)
<i>We have come to realize</i>

00:13:45.433 --> 00:13:48.000
that if New Domino City
is to survive,

00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:50.800
change is needed
and everyone in our society

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.633
must somehow come together
as they never have before.

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:57.266
With unrest breaking out
across the city,

00:13:57.266 --> 00:14:00.800
that goal seemed impossible,
but today Jack and Yuya

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:03.366
showed us the city
can be unified.

00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:06.533
New Domino will no longer
be divided in two.

00:14:06.533 --> 00:14:08.633
Instead, you must
work together

00:14:08.633 --> 00:14:11.966
to build a better future
for all our citizens!

00:14:11.966 --> 00:14:14.433
As a first step,
the members of the council

00:14:14.433 --> 00:14:17.233
have agreed to step down
immediately.

00:14:17.233 --> 00:14:19.700
We believe the future
of New Domino City

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:23.066
should be entrusted to a new
and younger generation.

00:14:23.066 --> 00:14:25.800
This direction is one
we deem to be sound.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.166
Do you, citizens of
New Domino City,

00:14:28.166 --> 00:14:29.233
<i>agree as well?</i>

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:32.500
(cheering)

00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.100
(Melissa)
Folks, whether you're
a Topsider, or a Common,

00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.200
or somewhere in between,
I think we can all agree

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.100
this is
a truly momentous moment!

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.633
Yesiree, this day is gonna be
one for the history books!

00:14:45.633 --> 00:14:47.566
And since I've been
right smack dab

00:14:47.566 --> 00:14:49.300
in the middle
of everything,

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.766
there will probably be
a chapter about me!

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.000
(stammering)

00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.200
Yuya, are you ready
to take your victory lap?

00:14:58.200 --> 00:14:59.700
Yep!
Sounds good.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.366
<i>Yuya!Roget took Zuzu!</i>

00:15:02.366 --> 00:15:03.533
He did what?

00:15:03.533 --> 00:15:06.000
That snake!
What happened, Sora?

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.100
We were getting
outta there

00:15:08.100 --> 00:15:10.700
when Roget just showed up
outta nowhere!

00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:13.233
I barely made it out
of there in one piece.

00:15:13.233 --> 00:15:16.166
Then there's no time
to waste.

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:20.100
Roget said that
he's taking Zuzu...

00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.700
back to...
Duel Academy...

00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.300
Aah!
Sora!

00:15:25.733 --> 00:15:28.000
(White)Yuya! It seems
you need a ride

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.900
to Sector
Security Headquarters.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:31.266
<i>Be sure to buckle up!</i>

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:42.000
You're nuts! Only a madman
would program

00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:44.100
his own headquarters
to self‐destruct!

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.366
What better way
to cover my tracks

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:48.366
than to leave
no tracks at all?

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:50.300
A brilliant plan indeed.

00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:53.100
Except all your other plans
went nowhere!

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.266
You're a failure!

00:15:54.266 --> 00:15:56.533
Ahh!
The whole place could blow!

00:15:56.533 --> 00:15:59.233
Let's move it!

00:15:59.233 --> 00:16:00.533
I'm warning you!

00:16:00.533 --> 00:16:03.400
Remember, I already took down
two of your allies!

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.500
Watch out or the same thing
might happen to you!

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:08.033
You're sicker
than sick!

00:16:08.033 --> 00:16:11.400
Risking all these lives
to cover your escape!

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.100
You know you've been
beaten, Roget!

00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:15.433
You can't cut it here,
so you're cutting out,

00:16:15.433 --> 00:16:18.466
a scared little puppy dog
scurrying back to Duel Academy!

00:16:18.466 --> 00:16:19.600
That's enough!

00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.333
This is not a retreat,
missy!

00:16:21.333 --> 00:16:24.700
I haven't lost!
This is a minor setback.

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:26.100
But I will return!

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:29.100
(Declan)
I don't think so, Roget.
You won't have a chance

00:16:29.100 --> 00:16:32.000
to come back, because
you're never leaving here.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.500
What's that?

00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:35.966
There's been a slight change
in your plans.

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:39.900
Oh, I should have known
you would show up.

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.633
Then you should have thought
of a better way to escape.

00:16:43.633 --> 00:16:46.900
But thinking isn't one
of your strong suits, now is it?

00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.633
Case in point, you actually
thought you could escape

00:16:49.633 --> 00:16:51.933
back to Duel Academy
with Zuzu.

00:16:51.933 --> 00:16:54.533
Sure, she could be
a good bargaining chip

00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:57.100
to curry favor
with my father...

00:16:57.100 --> 00:17:00.200
But there's one small
problem.

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:03.100
To make it any further
you'd have to get past me,

00:17:03.100 --> 00:17:06.366
and I'm about to expose you
for the gutless rat you are.

00:17:06.366 --> 00:17:09.300
Ahh!
You have two options, Roget.

00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:12.600
Option one,
surrender Zuzu to us.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.866
Option two,

00:17:13.866 --> 00:17:17.066
resist and we'll force you
to surrender...

00:17:17.066 --> 00:17:20.300
and get Zuzu back
anyway.

00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:21.633
Is that so?

00:17:21.633 --> 00:17:23.833
Well, I prefer to go
with Option Three.

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:26.866
I have other escape
routes, Dec‐lame!

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:28.233
(grunts)
Are you okay?

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.333
Wait! Declan!
(grunting)

00:17:47.333 --> 00:17:49.966
It was foolish of you
to come after me.

00:17:49.966 --> 00:17:52.366
No doubt you believe
you have the upper hand,

00:17:52.366 --> 00:17:54.866
but I am going to
prove you wrong...

00:17:54.866 --> 00:17:56.800
by breaking you.

00:17:56.800 --> 00:17:58.966
Though I'm willing
to make you an offer.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:03.700
If you truly want
to save Zuzu Boyle,

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:06.266
then take her place and come
with me as my prisoner

00:18:06.266 --> 00:18:09.133
to Duel Academy
and face your father.

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:10.533
You're kidding me,
right?

00:18:10.533 --> 00:18:12.066
Not so.

00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:14.233
If I showed up with you
instead of Zuzu,

00:18:14.233 --> 00:18:15.800
the Professor
would be thrilled.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.700
Just imagine the reception
I would get bringing home

00:18:19.700 --> 00:18:21.233
the Professor's
rebellious son

00:18:21.233 --> 00:18:23.333
so that he could receive
his punishment!

00:18:24.433 --> 00:18:25.866
Keep dreaming.

00:18:25.866 --> 00:18:27.433
When I go
to Duel Academy,

00:18:27.433 --> 00:18:32.166
it will be on my terms
and my terms alone.

00:18:32.166 --> 00:18:34.133
If you're so tough,
then you shouldn't have

00:18:34.133 --> 00:18:35.866
any trouble
outdueling me!

00:18:35.866 --> 00:18:37.833
Let's do this.

00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:43.100
(computer)
Generating Action Field:
Crossover.

00:18:47.266 --> 00:18:49.000
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:51.066
And now
for your demise.

00:18:51.066 --> 00:18:54.433
To start, I'll activate
the spell Polymerization

00:18:54.433 --> 00:18:57.866
and use it to fuse
two Ancient Gear Soldiers!

00:18:57.866 --> 00:19:00.566
Utilizing my vast
combat experience,

00:19:00.566 --> 00:19:03.266
along with my superior
tactical intellect,

00:19:03.266 --> 00:19:06.200
I will reconfigure my pair
of mechanized warriors

00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.466
into a devastating
war machine!

00:19:08.466 --> 00:19:12.966
I Fusion Summon
Ancient Gear Howitzer!

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.933
And for my next move,
I'll activate this!

00:19:27.933 --> 00:19:30.900
It's the spell
Ancient Gear Magic Shield!

00:19:30.900 --> 00:19:34.366
I'll equip it onto
Ancient Gear Howitzer!

00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:35.733
By equipping this shield,

00:19:35.733 --> 00:19:38.100
my Howitzer can't
be destroyed in battle,

00:19:38.100 --> 00:19:40.433
and gains
1,200 defense points,

00:19:40.433 --> 00:19:43.066
and now it's special ability
activates!

00:19:43.066 --> 00:19:44.900
For each spell card
on my field,

00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:47.300
you take
1,000 points of damage!

00:19:55.333 --> 00:19:59.000
A somersault and a cartwheel.
Nice moves, Declan.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:01.866
But you don't have the moves
to take out my monster

00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:03.833
because Magic Shield
protects it

00:20:03.833 --> 00:20:05.733
from all
your card effects.

00:20:05.733 --> 00:20:09.866
Why do you think
Duel Academy sent me here?

00:20:09.866 --> 00:20:13.600
Because I alone was capable
of conquering this dimension,

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:15.233
just as I will
conquer you!

00:20:24.766 --> 00:20:26.300
Don't worry, Zuzu.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.500
Roget isn't taking you
anywhere!

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:29.866
That's a promise.

00:20:29.866 --> 00:20:32.800
