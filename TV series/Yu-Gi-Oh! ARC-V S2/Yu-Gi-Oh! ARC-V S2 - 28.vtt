WEBVTT

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.000
<i>Howdy everyone!</i>

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.333
Are ya'll ready for
some duelin'?

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.400
I sure hope so, 'cause
some duelin' is brewin'!

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.633
After all, it's the
Friendship Cup's third day!

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.466
And that means we've now
entered the second round

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:17.466
and only eight
duelists remain!

00:00:17.466 --> 00:00:19.533
Who among 'em
will advance?

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:21.666
Well, whadaya say
we find out?!

00:00:21.666 --> 00:00:24.133
Today's first match up
will be...

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:27.833
Zuzu Boyle versus
Sergey Volkov!

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:29.633
(cheering)

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.566
Alright Zuzu,
you know Yuya's game plan...

00:00:38.066 --> 00:00:40.566
(Yuya)
I promise to take
center stage Zuzu...

00:00:40.566 --> 00:00:42.133
by winning
the Friendship Cup...

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:44.066
swinging the crowd my way...

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:47.800
and bringing smiles back
to the hearts of everyone!

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.400
Now it's time for me to step
into the spotlight

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.300
and win this crowd over...

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.766
After all,
there's a war coming.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:57.200
A dimensional war.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.466
And these poor people don't know
a thing about it,

00:00:59.466 --> 00:01:01.166
so I've got to warn them.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:02.600
But if they're going to
believe me,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.233
they need to respect me‐‐

00:01:04.233 --> 00:01:06.833
which means I need
to win this duel!

(cheering)

00:02:11.066 --> 00:02:13.633
Just listen to this
capacity crowd!

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:14.966
<i>But I gotta hunch...</i>

00:02:14.966 --> 00:02:16.466
It's about to
get even louder

00:02:16.466 --> 00:02:19.366
after I introduce
our first duelist...

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:22.600
She's sportin' two 'z's' but
she won't put ya to sleep:

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:23.866
<i>Zuzu Boyle!</i>

00:02:23.866 --> 00:02:25.000
(cheering)

00:02:27.766 --> 00:02:30.833
That Zuzu sure has a bright
future ahead of her!

00:02:30.833 --> 00:02:33.766
Bet She could
do anything!

00:02:33.766 --> 00:02:35.366
'Cept my job,
o' course.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.566
Jack Atlas...

00:02:38.566 --> 00:02:41.500
Get ready to see
what I can do.

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:54.866
Yuya, I know you're watching,
and I won't let you down.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.900
Go!
Win this!

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.133
(Melissa Trail)
And here he comes
Zuzu's opponent:

00:03:01.133 --> 00:03:03.000
<i>Sergey Volkov!</i>

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.966
They say no one duels with
moreconviction than Sergey,

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:07.700
but I'm pretty sure
that's 'cause Sergey

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.966
is an actual real‐life
convict! (laughing)

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.100
Zuzu will have to watch
herself 'round this fierce
felon

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.933
because as we've seen
he's an even bigger menace

00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:19.466
on the duel field
than he is to society!

00:03:19.466 --> 00:03:20.600
Go, Zuzu!

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.166
Take this thug down!

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:28.333
Listen carefully, Sergey...

00:03:28.333 --> 00:03:31.800
Zuzu is an essential piece
to my ultimate plan.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.333
You are to defeat her
by any means necessary

00:03:34.333 --> 00:03:35.933
and bring her to me...

00:03:35.933 --> 00:03:37.533
in one piece.

00:03:40.766 --> 00:03:43.400
And now, let's
giddy‐on‐up!

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.533
But, since the Duel Palace's
duel field was all chawed up

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:47.933
<i>during our last match up,</i>

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:50.566
we're givin' all you watchin'
a special treat

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.866
by takin' it
to the street!

00:03:52.866 --> 00:03:56.200
What say we start our
duelist's dash with a
splash!

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.100
<i>Now let's break it in!</i>

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.633
Let's activate
the Action Field:

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:16.333
<i>Crossover Acceleration!</i>

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:20.433
(robotic voice)
Duel Mode engaged.
Autopilot standing by.

00:04:20.433 --> 00:04:22.100
(Melissa)
<i>On your marks,</i>

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.300
<i>get set,</i>

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.333
<i>go!</i>

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:25.466
(tires screeching)

00:04:28.333 --> 00:04:29.533
Let's duel!
Duel!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.200
Let's duel!
Duel!

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.433
(cheering)

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:39.533
And now it's a race
for the Palace Gates.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.300
Whoever gets there first will
get the right to go first!

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.333
<i>Zuzu has the early lead!</i>

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:45.566
Yeah!

00:04:45.566 --> 00:04:48.000
Now the question is:
Can she hold onto it?

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.933
You could cut the tension
with a knife!

00:04:49.933 --> 00:04:51.700
Or better yet,
with a duel runner

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.833
because at the speeds these
two duelists are goin'

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.566
I'd reckon they would
shred through anything

00:04:55.566 --> 00:04:56.633
<i>that got in their way!</i>

00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:58.500
Which, incidentally,
is why I don't do

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.066
my announcin'
trackside anymore.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:04.366
Everything I've done so far
has gone to plan.

00:05:04.366 --> 00:05:06.466
What could possibly
go wrong now?

00:05:10.366 --> 00:05:13.833
(Melissa) Whoa! Sergey has
kicked things up a notch!

00:05:13.833 --> 00:05:15.666
He's gaining
on Zuzu fast!

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.500
<i>This'll be close!</i>

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.566
(engines roaring)

00:05:18.566 --> 00:05:20.400
Whoever exits
this tunnel first

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.733
wins the all‐important
first move...

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:24.900
<i>And it's Zuzu!</i>

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:29.100
Yes! I'm first!

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:32.800
I summon
Canon The Melodious Diva!

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:33.933
(melodious humming)

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.566
Next I'lI place one card
facedown and end my turn!

00:05:40.566 --> 00:05:42.866
And just like that,
the stage is set

00:05:42.866 --> 00:05:46.033
for a performance next turn
that Sergey won't forget‐‐

00:05:46.033 --> 00:05:48.300
and his life points
won't withstand!

00:05:49.366 --> 00:05:50.766
I draw.

00:05:51.933 --> 00:05:54.766
I summon Thorn Prisoner Van.

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:57.533
(growling)

00:05:57.533 --> 00:06:00.033
Huh? Zero attack points?

00:06:00.033 --> 00:06:02.600
Whoa.
What the hooey?!

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.933
Did Sergey really
just summon a card

00:06:04.933 --> 00:06:07.833
with zero attack points
in attack mode?!

00:06:07.833 --> 00:06:09.333
Huh?

00:06:09.333 --> 00:06:12.066
Just what could Sergey
be up to here?

00:06:12.066 --> 00:06:13.600
That is all.

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.400
What?

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.733
All he did was summon
a monster with no attack points?

00:06:20.733 --> 00:06:24.633
Why would he do that?

00:06:24.633 --> 00:06:27.700
Unless he's trying to throw me
off my game...

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:29.433
I draw!

00:06:29.433 --> 00:06:33.300
First, I'll activate the trap
card Melodious Rhythm Change!

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:38.900
Now, by returning a Melodious
monster to my hand

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.266
I can bring out a new one,
and the one I choose is this:

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:46.200
Mozarta The Melodious Maestra!

00:06:47.966 --> 00:06:51.066
Mozarta's special ability
activates!

00:06:51.066 --> 00:06:54.066
By hitting the perfect note
I'm able to summon

00:06:54.066 --> 00:06:57.466
a Melodious monster
that's Level Four‐or‐below!

00:06:57.466 --> 00:07:00.800
Come on back,
Canon The Melodious Diva!

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.400
Pathetic.

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.333
This musical number's
not over.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:07.966
Next up is this gal...

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:11.566
Come on out,
Solo The Melodious Songstress!

00:07:13.700 --> 00:07:16.066
Interesting.

00:07:16.066 --> 00:07:17.733
(Melissa)
<i>Talk about a quick‐draw!</i>

00:07:17.733 --> 00:07:21.300
Zuzu has already summoned
three monsters to her field,

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:24.366
and Sergey only has one
with zero attack points!

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:27.400
Is this duel over
before it's begun?

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:30.000
Yeah! Zuzu!
Take him down!

00:07:31.233 --> 00:07:32.566
Go time!

00:07:32.566 --> 00:07:35.766
Mozarta, belt one out
and attack Thorn Prisoner Van!

00:07:38.366 --> 00:07:39.433
<i>Whoa, Nelly!</i>

00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:41.800
Sergey's life points
will take a plunge!

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:44.100
Van's special ability activates.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:48.533
If I show I have another
Thorn Prisoner in hand,

00:07:48.533 --> 00:07:53.233
I pay 400 life points and take
no damage in battle.

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:54.566
Here is card.

00:07:54.566 --> 00:07:56.766
Thorn Prisoner Darli.

00:08:00.566 --> 00:08:01.700
(grunting)

00:08:04.333 --> 00:08:05.733
Huh?
(Melissa)
Ouch!

00:08:05.733 --> 00:08:09.466
That looked bad, but as far
as moves go it was good!

00:08:09.466 --> 00:08:11.600
And there is more for you.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:15.533
I am allowed to summon Van
along with Thorn Prisoner Darli!

00:08:15.533 --> 00:08:16.633
Come now!

00:08:20.233 --> 00:08:21.366
(muffled groaning)

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:29.566
Another monster
with zero attack points?

00:08:29.566 --> 00:08:32.700
Uh... Looks like Sergey
doesn't understand

00:08:32.700 --> 00:08:34.533
the concept of
defense mode.

00:08:34.533 --> 00:08:37.000
It's almost like
he's askin' to be attacked!

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.566
Solo The Melodious Songstress,
you're up!

00:08:40.566 --> 00:08:42.533
Attack Darli!

00:08:42.533 --> 00:08:45.400
Darli's ability activates.

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:47.366
By paying
400 life points

00:08:47.366 --> 00:08:49.933
I negate attack once per turn.

00:08:53.133 --> 00:08:54.233
(grunting)

00:08:58.233 --> 00:09:01.766
So be it‐‐ but I still have
one attack left!

00:09:01.766 --> 00:09:04.466
Canon, attack Darli!

00:09:04.466 --> 00:09:06.500
Since Darli can't use
its ability

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.066
this attack will hit home!

00:09:20.066 --> 00:09:22.800
Hold your horses!
Look there!

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.600
Sergey's goin' for
an Action Card!

00:09:26.766 --> 00:09:29.466
At least he was,
till that major misstep.

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.666
That's what I call
a rough landing.

00:09:33.666 --> 00:09:35.866
It's the perfect chance
for Zuzu to pounce.

00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:38.666
(metal grinding)

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.633
Sergey, are you okay?

00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:52.866
You're hurt!

00:09:52.866 --> 00:09:56.066
Hold on‐‐ I'll end my turn
so you can get help.

00:09:56.066 --> 00:09:57.200
(chuckling)

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:03.066
It's you...
who needs help!

00:10:06.166 --> 00:10:09.266
I must say, for being Roget's
top duel enforcer

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:12.466
Sergey sure seems to be
having trouble.

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.833
His vitals are spiking.

00:10:14.833 --> 00:10:16.033
Focus.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.200
Let's go!
(cheering)

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:24.033
I draw now.

00:10:24.033 --> 00:10:27.166
I summon second
Thorn Prisoner Darli!

00:10:32.466 --> 00:10:34.466
And next...

00:10:34.466 --> 00:10:37.366
Level One Darli
tunes Level One Van.

00:10:43.866 --> 00:10:46.333
I Synchro Summon...

00:10:46.333 --> 00:10:48.466
Thorn Observer Zuma!

00:10:51.066 --> 00:10:52.200
(growling)

00:10:55.333 --> 00:10:57.566
Its ability activates!

00:10:57.566 --> 00:11:01.833
One Thorn Counter is placed
on every monster on the field.

00:11:01.833 --> 00:11:03.033
Huh?!

00:11:03.033 --> 00:11:04.266
(grunting)

00:11:04.266 --> 00:11:06.033
(chuckling)

00:11:06.033 --> 00:11:10.533
At end of turn,
I take 400 points damage

00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:13.833
for every monster I have
with Thorn Counter.

00:11:13.833 --> 00:11:15.733
But at end of your turn,

00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:19.366
you take damage
from your monsters.

00:11:19.366 --> 00:11:22.033
I place one card facedown
and end turn.

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:29.400
Since I have one Thorn Counter,

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:33.600
I'm taking
400 points of damage.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.733
(grunting)

00:11:37.166 --> 00:11:39.300
Ya know, I'd like to feel bad
for Sergey

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:41.166
but he's doing this
to himself.

00:11:41.166 --> 00:11:43.566
Ouch, talk about sufferin'
for you craft!

00:11:43.566 --> 00:11:46.500
His vitals are still rising.

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:48.233
He must calm himself.

00:11:49.800 --> 00:11:52.566
(Melissa)
It's Zuzu's move,
but with all her monsters

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:54.233
being prevented
from attackin',

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:56.600
does she even have
a move to make?

00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:58.233
Zuzu, don't give up.

00:11:58.233 --> 00:12:00.366
Remember what
you're dueling for!

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:02.433
Here we go!

00:12:02.433 --> 00:12:05.900
Come on.
Please, please...

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.166
Yes, perfect!

00:12:07.166 --> 00:12:12.033
I now activate trap card
Thorn Growth!

00:12:12.033 --> 00:12:14.300
It doubles damage
from Thorn Counters!

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:16.300
(gasping)

00:12:18.233 --> 00:12:21.333
(screaming)

00:12:21.333 --> 00:12:23.800
(Zuzu)
As if the stakes
weren't high enough already!

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.666
Unless my next move
is the right move,

00:12:25.666 --> 00:12:27.300
I could be done for!

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:30.766
I can't let that happen.
Here goes...

00:12:30.766 --> 00:12:32.966
I activate Polymerization!

00:12:34.533 --> 00:12:36.400
With it,
I'll fuse together

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:38.200
Mozarta...

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.400
Canon...

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.433
and Solo.

00:12:41.433 --> 00:12:44.666
Now listen as these three
harmonize and fuse into one

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:46.366
as their powers merge
and transform

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.533
into something
even more melodic.

00:12:48.533 --> 00:12:51.000
Behold, the show‐stopping
songstress

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:53.066
whose voice will blow you away:

00:12:53.066 --> 00:12:55.166
Bloom Prima
The Melodious Choir!

00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:58.566
And here's the best part,
Sergey...

00:12:58.566 --> 00:13:01.800
For each of the three monsters
that I used to summon Prima,

00:13:01.800 --> 00:13:04.300
she gains 300
attack points!

00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.200
So that's a bonus
of 900!

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.100
Thorn Growth's effect activates.

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.800
When Thorn Counter
leaves the field,

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:16.466
I take 100 points damage
for each one.

00:13:19.166 --> 00:13:20.300
(grunting)

00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:23.500
There he goes again...

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.833
It's almost like
he's his own worst enemy.

00:13:26.833 --> 00:13:29.900
And now:
Bloom Prima, attack Zuma!

00:13:33.066 --> 00:13:37.100
Since you attacked Zuma,
special ability activates.

00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:40.333
When monsters I used to summon
Zuma are in graveyard,

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:43.933
I pay 400 life points
to avoid taking damage.

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:46.333
(grunting)

00:13:46.333 --> 00:13:48.633
And since Zuma left the field,

00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:52.433
Thorn Growth deals me
100 points of damage.

00:13:52.433 --> 00:13:53.566
(grunting)

00:13:55.766 --> 00:13:57.166
And there's more...

00:13:57.166 --> 00:13:59.400
With no Thorn Counters
on the field,

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:02.366
Thorn Growth is destroyed!

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:06.100
But due to Zuma's special
ability, I can summon Zuma

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:09.100
and the monsters that were used
to Synchro Summon it.

00:14:09.100 --> 00:14:11.033
(growling and groaning)

00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:15.100
(Melissa) Jumpin'
Jiminy Jackrabbit!

00:14:15.100 --> 00:14:18.200
Sergey has once again filled
his field with monsters!

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.733
But what's even harder to
swaller' is that he's gone

00:14:20.733 --> 00:14:23.266
and placed 'em all
in attack mode again!

00:14:23.266 --> 00:14:25.766
I just don't get it.

00:14:25.766 --> 00:14:27.366
What's he doing?

00:14:27.366 --> 00:14:28.500
Sergey...

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.633
You're not the only one
with abilities.

00:14:30.633 --> 00:14:32.366
Bloom Prima has one, too,

00:14:32.366 --> 00:14:34.033
and it lets her attack
Zuma again!

00:14:36.166 --> 00:14:39.133
That is of no concern to me.

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:41.733
Due to Darli's
special ability,

00:14:41.733 --> 00:14:44.633
I pay 400 life points
to negate attack.

00:14:46.933 --> 00:14:48.400
<i>Sergey's done it again!</i>

00:14:48.400 --> 00:14:51.766
He's evaded Zuzu's attack
only to deal damage to himself,

00:14:51.766 --> 00:14:54.300
and now he's down to 200
life points!

00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:57.233
If this goes on
he'll lose for sure!

00:14:57.233 --> 00:15:00.033
Well...
I guess this is over.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.866
It's as though
he wants to lose.

00:15:03.866 --> 00:15:05.433
(Declan)
Wrong...
Huh?

00:15:05.433 --> 00:15:09.433
Sergey is simply, yet painfully,
backing himself against a wall,

00:15:09.433 --> 00:15:11.433
because when you have
nothing to lose

00:15:11.433 --> 00:15:14.266
then that is when
you can strike without fear.

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:19.633
I'm now through with my turn.

00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:23.000
But strangely, I'm not through
being concerned for Sergey.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.300
How he was hurt earlier.

00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.066
Maybe showing compassion
is a better way

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:29.300
to get this crowd's respect
than winning.

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.400
(Zuzu)
Hey!
Huh?

00:15:31.666 --> 00:15:34.066
I think that we oughta
pause this duel.

00:15:34.066 --> 00:15:36.266
We have an
injured duelist here!

00:15:36.266 --> 00:15:39.633
(Zuzu)
We need to stop this until
we're sure that's he's okay!

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:43.000
(men)
We say no way!

00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:44.500
I wanna see more!

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.900
That's right,
get back to battlin'!

00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:48.533
What's wrong with you all?

00:15:48.533 --> 00:15:51.600
Weren't you ever taught
to show people some mercy?

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:54.466
This isn't what dueling
is supposed to be about!

00:15:54.466 --> 00:15:55.600
This isn't right!

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.966
It's like Yuya said...

00:16:00.233 --> 00:16:02.600
You all call this
the Friendship Cup, but...

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.866
That's just a big lie!

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.600
Zuzu...
(Zuzu)
This tournament has absolutely

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.866
nothing to do
with friendship.

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:09.866
<i>And that's a problem,</i>

00:16:09.866 --> 00:16:11.833
because friendship
and unity

00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:13.933
is what you all
need most right now!

00:16:13.933 --> 00:16:15.833
It's the only way
you'll be able to fight

00:16:15.833 --> 00:16:18.200
the coming invasion
from Duel Academy!

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:20.400
It's the only way
you'll survive!

00:16:20.400 --> 00:16:21.800
<i>But it's not too late!</i>

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.433
<i>There's still time‐‐</i>

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:26.100
Time to remember what it
means to look out for one
another!

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.200
<i>Like friends would!</i>

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.766
That's right!
You tell 'em, Zuzu!

00:16:29.766 --> 00:16:31.433
Get them to listen to you!

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:33.600
Come on!
Listen!

00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:34.733
You fool!

00:16:35.966 --> 00:16:37.900
You talk of mercy...

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:39.366
But tell me this...

00:16:39.366 --> 00:16:41.533
What if I
don't want it?

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.866
What if I don't need it?

00:16:43.866 --> 00:16:46.400
What if it's you
who's in danger?

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:48.566
Sure, I may be injured.

00:16:48.566 --> 00:16:51.033
And yes,
down on life points too.

00:16:51.033 --> 00:16:52.300
But that's...

00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:54.700
Just how I like it.

00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:56.166
Say what?

00:16:56.166 --> 00:16:59.533
Mercy, worry, concern,

00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:03.500
All signs ofweakness...

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.100
And like all
who are weak...

00:17:07.100 --> 00:17:11.166
They must be destroyed!

00:17:11.166 --> 00:17:13.833
(siren blaring)

00:17:13.833 --> 00:17:16.733
This is what
I was afraid of.

00:17:16.733 --> 00:17:19.100
I just hope
he doesn't go too far.

00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:21.233
I need her unscathed.

00:17:21.233 --> 00:17:23.166
Such fear I see...

00:17:23.166 --> 00:17:26.166
Like a mouse being
hunted by a lion.

00:17:26.166 --> 00:17:31.000
Try to scurry away‐‐
but you'll never escape!

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.033
So many have tried...

00:17:33.033 --> 00:17:34.533
...too many
to recall...

00:17:34.533 --> 00:17:37.200
but I know how many
have succeeded.

00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.900
The answer?

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:40.933
Absolutely none.

00:17:40.933 --> 00:17:44.133
And that number
isn't going to change today.

00:17:44.133 --> 00:17:45.933
Bye‐bye, little mouse!

00:17:45.933 --> 00:17:47.233
Ah!

00:17:49.900 --> 00:17:51.366
(Sergey laughing)

00:17:51.366 --> 00:17:52.966
My turn now!

00:17:52.966 --> 00:17:55.766
And first
I activate Polymerization!

00:17:55.766 --> 00:17:57.400
Polymerization?

00:17:57.400 --> 00:18:01.566
I fuse Van, Darli and Zuma
together to create

00:18:01.566 --> 00:18:03.933
new ultimate monster‐‐

00:18:03.933 --> 00:18:08.766
a beast that doesn't want mercy,
only chaos!

00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:11.233
I Fusion Summon...

00:18:11.233 --> 00:18:14.300
Unleash heartpounding dread,

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:17.733
Thorn Over Server
Vandarlizuma!

00:18:20.233 --> 00:18:22.133
Huh?
Is he crazy?!

00:18:22.133 --> 00:18:24.066
Sergey's played
yet another monster

00:18:24.066 --> 00:18:26.100
with zero attack points
in attack mode?

00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.966
Gotta admit, after all that
tough talk about 'rage'

00:18:28.966 --> 00:18:31.866
and 'chaos'
Sergey sure didn't deliver.

00:18:31.866 --> 00:18:34.300
Careful.
He's up to something.

00:18:34.300 --> 00:18:36.766
Okay, stay focused.

00:18:36.766 --> 00:18:39.066
Time to gain from pain!

00:18:39.066 --> 00:18:43.500
I subtract my life points from
2500 and double that number!

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:47.033
And that number becomes
Vandarlizuma's attack points!

00:18:47.033 --> 00:18:48.100
(gasping)

00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:50.300
Sergey has 200 life points...

00:18:50.300 --> 00:18:52.000
So that would mean...

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.866
(Yuya)
It has 4600 attack points!

00:18:54.866 --> 00:18:58.200
(gasping)
And by paying
100 life points...

00:18:58.200 --> 00:19:01.433
I reduce one of your monster's
attack points to 100.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:06.033
In other words: Bloom Prima
is now singing blues!

00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:13.666
And then Vandarlizuma's
attack points go up even more!

00:19:13.666 --> 00:19:16.433
Whoa, Zuzu's in serious
trouble!

00:19:16.433 --> 00:19:20.266
And all because Sergey is
seriously off his rocker!

00:19:20.266 --> 00:19:22.066
This is horrible...

00:19:22.066 --> 00:19:24.933
Sergey's gonna attack
and take out Zuzu.

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.500
Zuzu is going to lose
this duel...

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:32.266
Let's just hope
that's all she loses.

00:19:32.266 --> 00:19:35.500
Vandarlizuma,
annihilate Bloom Prima!

00:19:38.566 --> 00:19:39.633
(growling)

00:19:42.266 --> 00:19:43.533
(gasping)

00:19:43.533 --> 00:19:45.200
Huh?
An Action Card!

00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.000
That's the only thing
that can save me.

00:19:50.800 --> 00:19:53.633
No... nothing can save you!

00:19:53.633 --> 00:19:56.233
Now... feel... my...

00:19:56.233 --> 00:19:57.333
Rage!

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.833
Zuzu!

00:20:07.833 --> 00:20:11.033
And now here comes
the very best part ...

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:12.333
You...

00:20:12.333 --> 00:20:13.833
Lose!

00:20:32.666 --> 00:20:33.866
Farewell.

00:20:35.066 --> 00:20:36.466
Foolish brute!

00:20:38.266 --> 00:20:41.600
Security, retrieve Zuzu
and bring her to me!

00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:43.400
In a shocking
turn of events,

00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:46.300
Sergey Volkov
has taken the "W"

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.166
but not before taking out
his opponent, Zuzu,

00:20:49.166 --> 00:20:52.833
sendingher crashing hard
into a soaring skyscraper

00:20:52.833 --> 00:20:55.200
where her fate
is as yet unkown.

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:59.300
Zuzu's a fighter folks, but
until we learn otherwise,

00:20:59.300 --> 00:21:01.033
she may be down
for the count.

00:21:02.466 --> 00:21:03.600
No!
