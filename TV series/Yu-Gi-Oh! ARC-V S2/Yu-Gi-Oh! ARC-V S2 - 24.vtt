00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.866
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.200
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Two more duelists
are about to dance

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.066
with Yugo taking on Sylvio
Sawatari!

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:11.066
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:12.900
Here goes!

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.833
I Synchro Summon! Clear Wing
Sychro Dragon!

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.433
(roaring)

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:22.266
(Melissa)
Yugo just Synchro Summoned in
record time!

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.000
That Dragon's
awful powerful,

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.100
and it looks like it's got a
nasty temper, too!

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.633
Back to you, Sylvio!

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.433
(Melissa)
Just look at how Yugo
and Sylvio

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.233
are jostling
for position!

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.466
What's going on, Odd‐Eyes?

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.133
Why are you glowing?

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:41.733
I activate the spell Abyss Prop
Wild Wagon!

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:46.233
Clear Wing, take flight and
finish off this fight!

00:00:46.233 --> 00:00:47.933
Huh?

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.400
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:55.000
(Melissa)
<i>What a duel!</i>

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.500
Yugo pulled off
one doozy of a win!

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:01.000
Huh?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.500
(thinking)
What happened?

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.566
It's like I was dueling...

00:01:03.566 --> 00:01:05.900
Now come along.
Show's over.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.733
Wait, come along where?

00:01:07.733 --> 00:01:10.133
Let me go!
Remove your hands!

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:13.166
No!
Not you, too!

Let me go, you goons!

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.400
I demand to know where you
gorillas are taking me!

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.066
I would have
told you earlier,

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:24.066
but you didn't say
the magic word.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:25.433
Pretty please!

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.433
Everybody who loses a duel
gets sent to the underground,

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:31.100
and it's always
a one‐way trip.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:34.400
Well, I only travel first class,
so I'm not going!

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.666
I‐‐ I refuse!
You can't do this to me!

00:02:37.666 --> 00:02:39.466
Yeah, well, we're doing it.

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:41.733
And if I was you, I'd learn
the rules and follow 'em.

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:43.966
What rules?

00:02:43.966 --> 00:02:46.233
The rules you need
to get by.

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:48.566
So if you don't wanna be
dumpster diving,

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:52.933
pay attention,
or pay the consequences!

00:02:52.933 --> 00:02:55.366
How about I just pay you to
reverse this ride

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:56.766
and let me slide?

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:58.400
(sinister laugh)
(sinister laugh)

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:59.800
And ruin all the fun?

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.433
Not a chance.

00:03:01.433 --> 00:03:05.000
Now, say hello to your
new home away from home.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700
Better face facts, friend.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.466
You've fallen hard.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.500
You're in the basement now.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.166
The last, pitiful stop for
New Domino City's

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.866
losers, misfits
and malcontents.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:29.633
Any dreams you may have had of a
better life are up in smoke now.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:31.433
But you see, this ain't
rock bottom,

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.366
'cause' no matter how low you
go, there's somebody 'round

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:37.266
that's looking to bring you
down even lower.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.966
If you think it's hot now,
well it can get hotter.

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:43.566
And the funk?
Oh, the funk can get funkier.

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:45.133
So if you want to impress,

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:47.333
might I suggest you toss your
losing ways,

00:03:47.333 --> 00:03:50.300
'cause this is the proverbial
tip of the trash heap.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:54.166
There's a long way to fall, and
you ain't got no parachute.

00:03:54.166 --> 00:03:56.366
You keep on dueling and losing,

00:03:56.366 --> 00:03:58.866
there's no telling how low
you'll go.

00:03:58.866 --> 00:04:01.666
I... want out!

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:02.866
Huh?

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:04.933
Send me back up.

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:07.666
That Yuya got lucky, but next
time I'll beat him.

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:10.466
And when I do, I'll be
a Duel Chaser again!

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:13.500
I'm afraid that's not
the way it works, my friend.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.033
Sure, I'm the guy that
got the connections

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:17.500
to help you fly the coop,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.033
but you had your shot
and you wasted it.

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:23.300
No! Please!
I'm begging you!

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.566
Give me one more chance!
Too late, copper!

00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.666
The only way to get topside

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:33.833
is to start winning some duels
down here, you dig?

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:36.366
But it's not gonna be no
walk in the park.

00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:39.300
The competition's just as tough
as upstairs,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.600
and they'll crush you
just as hard.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.400
Now if you want to get
another audience

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.900
with the Sultan of Swank,
start winning some duels.

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.700
Now get out of my sight!

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.400
(Gong)
Stop right there!

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:54.900
Tell your thugs
to let him go, Lucas!

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.266
Well, if it isn't the
legendary Hero Chojiro.

00:04:59.266 --> 00:05:02.800
And if I'm not mistaken, it's
Dashing Dennis' right‐hand man,

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:04.966
Gong the Goon, correct?

00:05:04.966 --> 00:05:09.133
Sorry I hadn't had the
opportunity to welcome you two.

00:05:09.133 --> 00:05:12.700
So how about I make it up to you
with a very special offer?

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:15.733
You two beat everyone of my boys
here in a duel,

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:18.533
and I'll see about sending you
back above ground.

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:21.900
Have your pack of punks gang up
so they pulverize us?

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.933
That's exactly the kind of
"special offer"

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:27.466
I'd expect from a sleazy,
slimy snake like you!

00:05:27.466 --> 00:05:28.733
Come on, now.

00:05:28.733 --> 00:05:30.900
I'm just trying to cut you
all some kindness.

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.466
There usually ain't no
exit door from this place,

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:36.400
but if you can show me
you got the skill to thrill,

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.400
I could be persuaded to
present you with an opportunity

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:41.633
to escape your situation
in a manner

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:44.366
that anyone here would do
anything to have.

00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:45.600
Huh?

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.900
You appreciated it
when I gave you

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.366
the same chance to duel
your way out of here.

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:53.800
The problem was that
you underestimated
the competition, right?

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:56.100
You said, and I quote,

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.200
"Throw as many Commons
at me as you want,

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:00.933
but they can't win
'cause I'm a Topsider."

00:06:00.933 --> 00:06:02.866
(moans)

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:03.800
(thud)

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.766
Maybe the two of you
can avoid

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:07.900
making the same mistake he did.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.800
You got a lot of nerve,
you cheesy lowlife!

00:06:10.800 --> 00:06:12.500
Who are you?

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.266
You told Gong that
you were a promoter,

00:06:15.266 --> 00:06:17.866
but all you seem
to be promoting is pain.

00:06:17.866 --> 00:06:19.633
Well, you see...

00:06:19.633 --> 00:06:23.133
I'm also a refuse reclamation
entrepreneur.

00:06:23.133 --> 00:06:24.766
Refuse recla‐what?

00:06:24.766 --> 00:06:26.600
Refuse is trash.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.866
Are you saying we're trash?

00:06:27.866 --> 00:06:29.433
Not me.

00:06:29.433 --> 00:06:31.666
The powers that be are the ones
who throw away duelists

00:06:31.666 --> 00:06:33.233
who lose in the Friendship Cup.

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:34.933
They're the ones
who say you're trash.

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:38.300
But me, I know that even in
a mountain of junk,

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:41.433
sometimes you can find
a hidden gem,

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:43.133
and that's exactly
what I'm doing here.

00:06:43.133 --> 00:06:44.700
Looking 'round for gems.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.633
What happens
when you find 'em?

00:06:46.633 --> 00:06:50.133
Do you send 'em to battle
in that underground
duel arena of yours?

00:06:50.133 --> 00:06:51.966
How could I not?

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:53.500
But the diamonds?

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.800
I take them straight
to the boss.

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.100
Who's the boss?

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.300
A man who's all power
and no cower,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:02.600
the Director of Security.

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:04.100
Jean Michel Roget.

00:07:09.766 --> 00:07:11.666
Let Gong get this straight.

00:07:11.666 --> 00:07:14.700
You're in cahoots with the
Director of Security?

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.600
Whenever there's a raid on the
underground duel arena,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.533
Mr. Roget lets me know
in advance,

00:07:19.533 --> 00:07:22.533
so I'm able to avoid
incarceration.

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:25.066
In return, I supply him with
what he wants.

00:07:25.066 --> 00:07:27.633
You provide the Director
with the best duelists

00:07:27.633 --> 00:07:29.433
and he lets you go about
your business.

00:07:29.433 --> 00:07:31.700
I think the both of you
are disgusting.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.500
Why does he take 'em, Swank?

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:36.900
I never asked,
and Mr. Roget doesn't say.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.766
All I know is the boss wants
all the tough duelists

00:07:39.766 --> 00:07:41.233
I can get for him.

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:44.533
You know that duelist they call
Sergei from the Friendship Cup?

00:07:44.533 --> 00:07:46.266
He's one of the discoveries

00:07:46.266 --> 00:07:49.300
I presented as a gift to
Mr. Roget.

00:07:51.066 --> 00:07:53.000
Now, let me introduce
the duelists

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:56.066
about to lock horns in today's
third exciting matchup!

00:07:56.066 --> 00:07:58.700
So please stand up and stomp
your spurs

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.966
for New Domino's Damon
Lopez and Sergei Volkoff!

00:08:03.966 --> 00:08:07.666
The dueling dynamo Damon is
entering first!

00:08:07.666 --> 00:08:09.066
(laughs)

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:10.466
<i>And coming up fast</i>

00:08:10.466 --> 00:08:14.433
is the dangerous and
diabolicalSergei!

00:08:14.433 --> 00:08:16.633
Not that Sergei.

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:17.900
It's got to be him.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:20.800
(Lucas)
They call him the Dueling
Destroyer.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:25.800
When I found Sergei, he was, uh,
very well known in the City.

00:08:25.800 --> 00:08:29.166
Sergei didn't care if a
duelist was a pro or an amateur.

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:33.233
Long as they had skills, he'd
challenge 'em and destroy
'em.

00:08:33.233 --> 00:08:35.200
After his last rampage,

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.433
it took half of Security to
bring him down.

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:41.833
But even in The Facility,
he couldn't be contained.

00:08:41.833 --> 00:08:45.300
Finally, they sent him down to
the underground.

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.700
When Sergei got here, I made him
the same offer I'm making you.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.200
He accepted and beat 50
of my top men.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.733
50 duelists?

00:08:53.733 --> 00:08:55.200
All by himself?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:58.533
It was a feat worthy of
a call to Roget.

00:08:58.533 --> 00:09:01.333
And, boy, did I make
Roget's day!

00:09:01.333 --> 00:09:04.733
He brought Sergei back up top
lickety split.

00:09:04.733 --> 00:09:07.533
Destroy your foes,
my knight.

00:09:07.533 --> 00:09:12.900
And soon my dreams
will become a reality.

00:09:18.400 --> 00:09:20.800
Damon versus Sergei?

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:23.266
That leaves two remaining
duelists to battle:

00:09:23.266 --> 00:09:24.833
Shay and Dennis.

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.066
Interesting.

00:09:28.066 --> 00:09:31.166
Since this duel doesn't
involve a Lancer,

00:09:31.166 --> 00:09:33.833
I hope you won't mind if I
step out for a few moments.

00:09:33.833 --> 00:09:37.833
That's fine, Declan, but where
is it you're going?

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:40.433
Out for a breath of fresh air.

00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:46.933
That's crazy!

00:09:46.933 --> 00:09:50.400
Sergei's brain is all bot, but
his brawn's flesh and bones?

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:53.300
(Lucas) I'm just saying
what some people say.

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:57.366
He's programmed to destroy
every duelist like a machine.

00:09:57.366 --> 00:09:58.933
And remember:

00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:02.033
this guy used to be a wild,
ruthless criminal.

00:10:02.033 --> 00:10:05.100
But now he does whatever the
Director directs him to do.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:08.766
He's totally under his
control, like a robot.

00:10:08.766 --> 00:10:11.433
So Roget can
control people.

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:13.900
Yeah. It's like he has
a technology

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:15.733
that's out of this world.

00:10:15.733 --> 00:10:17.000
Huh?

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.766
Maybe he got it
from that place

00:10:18.766 --> 00:10:20.766
you were blabbing about
before Dennis's elbow

00:10:20.766 --> 00:10:22.766
went kung fu on you.

00:10:22.766 --> 00:10:24.700
We came from
the Standard Dimension

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.933
to the Synchro Dimension.

00:10:25.933 --> 00:10:27.266
Uhh!

00:10:27.266 --> 00:10:28.666
You nearly broke a rib!

00:10:28.666 --> 00:10:32.200
Could be, could be not.

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:34.933
Yeah, seems very unlikely.

00:10:34.933 --> 00:10:38.500
Then again, Roget is a very
unlikely person.

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.833
One day, he just showed up,

00:10:40.833 --> 00:10:42.666
and before you could say
"New Domino"

00:10:42.666 --> 00:10:45.500
he had the High Council eating
out of his hands.

00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:48.600
They made Roget the top dog of
Sector Security,

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.566
and he's been barking orders
ever since.

00:10:51.566 --> 00:10:55.000
Let's get this rodeo
rocking and those runners
rolling!

00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.366
(computer)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:10:57.366 --> 00:10:59.500
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:11:01.433 --> 00:11:03.500
(Melissa)
<i>On your mark...</i>

00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.833
<i>Get set...</i>

00:11:04.833 --> 00:11:06.333
<i>Go!</i>

00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:10.466
Let's duel!

00:11:10.466 --> 00:11:14.233
So if this Roget ain't from
around these parts...

00:11:14.233 --> 00:11:18.666
then Gong reckons he might've
done some dimension hopping!

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.833
(explosion)

00:11:23.833 --> 00:11:25.166
(Melissa)
<i>I'll be!</i>

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.933
Damon's devastatingly
dangerous Alien Shocktrooper

00:11:27.933 --> 00:11:30.733
just demolished the last of
Sergei's monsters!

00:11:30.733 --> 00:11:33.100
Now Sergei's been left
wide open!

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:35.600
I expected a fight from you,
Sergei.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.033
Truth is I've had tougher
battles with a hangnail!

00:11:38.033 --> 00:11:40.266
(crowd shouting)

00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.833
Sergei's done!

00:11:44.833 --> 00:11:47.666
Getting caught by Security must
have took all the destroying

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:49.866
out of the big, bad Dueling
Destroyer!

00:11:49.866 --> 00:11:51.766
You think so?

00:11:51.766 --> 00:11:54.300
We'll see.
We'll see.

00:11:54.300 --> 00:11:56.966
Roget's good for business,

00:11:56.966 --> 00:11:58.800
so I'm good with Roget.

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:02.400
Weren't for him, I'd have
been locked up long ago.

00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.800
Least I can do is pick
through the trash here

00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.633
and find him the best duelists
I can.

00:12:06.633 --> 00:12:09.700
He's the reason I can make you
my offer.

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:11.266
Just beat all the duelist's
down here,

00:12:11.266 --> 00:12:13.133
and I'll get you back up top.

00:12:15.366 --> 00:12:17.500
I'm giving you
the best opportunity

00:12:17.500 --> 00:12:19.433
you're gonna get to
get above ground again.

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:22.000
But if you don't think you can
handle it...

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.433
Chojiro can handle it
just fine!

00:12:26.533 --> 00:12:28.866
If you don't want to
wind up here forever,

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:30.266
you better take a shot.

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:31.900
Oh, no!

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.933
They sent you here
for helping me escape?

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:36.500
I wish I could
make it up to you!

00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.200
If you really wanna make it up,
take us on in a duel.

00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:43.033
That way, at least one of us
might get out of here.

00:12:43.033 --> 00:12:45.833
But when Roget finds out
that we won the battle,

00:12:45.833 --> 00:12:47.833
it ain't gonna be you!

00:12:47.833 --> 00:12:49.300
You lousy...

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.966
You think you could beat me,
you ungrateful little rat?

00:12:51.966 --> 00:12:54.800
Calm down! This isn't gonna
help us get outta here!

00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.800
I can beat both of you
talentless pipsqueaks without
even breaking a sweat!

00:12:56.800 --> 00:12:57.800
Let me go, Gong, let me go!

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.166
I'm the one
who's getting out!

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:07.766
I can go topside if
I beat you all, right?

00:13:07.766 --> 00:13:10.333
Well, that's just what I'm
prepared to do!

00:13:10.333 --> 00:13:12.666
Now, who wants to be
loser number one?

00:13:12.666 --> 00:13:14.000
Sylvio!

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:17.300
This boy sounds like he really
means business.

00:13:17.300 --> 00:13:19.366
And that means more business
for me.

00:13:32.433 --> 00:13:33.966
All right!

00:13:33.966 --> 00:13:35.600
This battle was a breeze!

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:37.900
Second round, here I come!

00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:39.800
(cheering)

00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.033
Oh, man.

00:13:44.033 --> 00:13:46.233
This isn't what dueling
should be.

00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:48.566
They're just rooting for Sergei
to get what he deserves

00:13:48.566 --> 00:13:50.966
and get sent underground.

00:13:50.966 --> 00:13:53.366
I wish...

00:13:53.366 --> 00:13:55.333
I had gotten through to them.

00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:01.733
If what you heard
is correct,

00:14:01.733 --> 00:14:04.633
then Roget must have
come from...

00:14:04.633 --> 00:14:07.333
Duel Academy in
the Fusion Dimension.

00:14:07.333 --> 00:14:09.300
Huh?

00:14:09.300 --> 00:14:11.166
Nicely done.

00:14:11.166 --> 00:14:14.233
Continue gathering information
from underground.

00:14:14.233 --> 00:14:17.933
Observe and report back to me
how the Lancers are doing.

00:14:17.933 --> 00:14:20.466
I will.

00:14:20.466 --> 00:14:22.833
Wait. Don't go yet.

00:14:35.333 --> 00:14:37.966
I...
I, uh...

00:14:39.033 --> 00:14:40.900
Be gritty!

00:14:43.133 --> 00:14:45.966
Just wanna say that I'm sorry.

00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:49.066
I'm sorry, Moon Shadow,
and I'm sorry, Declan.

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:51.033
Sorry for what?

00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:54.866
I was the one who was supposed
to duel in the Friendship Cup,

00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:58.933
but you made Moon Shadow duel
for me and got in trouble.

00:14:58.933 --> 00:15:02.833
Bowing out of your duel only
made it easier for Moon Shadow

00:15:02.833 --> 00:15:04.766
to gain access to the
underground.

00:15:04.766 --> 00:15:06.800
It still doesn't make it okay

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.866
that I was rooting for
Moon Shadow to lose.

00:15:09.866 --> 00:15:12.500
Why would you root
against him?

00:15:12.500 --> 00:15:15.300
Because he's better than me.

00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:18.700
Your moves were awesome and you
were in the lead...

00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.333
And I got scared,

00:15:21.333 --> 00:15:24.166
that if he won you'd like him
more than me.

00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:27.766
I wanted to be someone
Declan could count on,

00:15:27.766 --> 00:15:29.533
like Moon Shadow.

00:15:29.533 --> 00:15:33.233
And, maybe someday,
I'm gonna be.

00:15:33.233 --> 00:15:35.900
If you've got the stuff, kid,

00:15:35.900 --> 00:15:37.800
then don't be afraid
to use it.

00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:39.100
'Cause when you do,

00:15:39.100 --> 00:15:41.766
there won't be anybody
who'll be able to stop you.

00:15:43.333 --> 00:15:46.966
I'm gonna be a super‐amazing
duelist like you two.

00:15:46.966 --> 00:15:48.700
And Yuya.

00:15:48.700 --> 00:15:51.466
And Yuya?

00:15:51.466 --> 00:15:53.500
<i>(shouting on TV)</i>

00:15:56.233 --> 00:15:57.233
Huh?

00:15:57.233 --> 00:16:00.333
Damon?

00:16:00.333 --> 00:16:02.700
(Melissa, on P. A.)
What a come‐from‐behind
victory!

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:04.233
<i>I hope the boy's okay.</i>

00:16:04.233 --> 00:16:07.866
I'm not sure how what just
happened happened.

00:16:14.100 --> 00:16:16.466
I can't believe Sergei won.

00:16:16.466 --> 00:16:18.733
Damon was so far ahead
of him!

00:16:18.733 --> 00:16:21.600
Yeah, Sergei was getting
destroyed until
a few seconds ago!

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.566
It appears
the Dueling Destroyer

00:16:24.566 --> 00:16:28.400
hasn't lost his
destroying ways after all.

00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:30.366
That duel was too easy.

00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:32.866
Not enough to satisfy his
appetite.

00:16:37.633 --> 00:16:40.100
(Melissa, on P. A.) I‐I
don't know how he did it,

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:42.700
but in a dramatic
come‐from‐behind victory,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.766
Damon is out,
and the winner is

00:16:44.766 --> 00:16:48.166
the Dueling Destroyer,
Sergei Volkoff!

00:16:49.666 --> 00:16:53.500
Another duelist sent away to
work away in the underground.

00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.966
(knock on door)
Huh?

00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:01.033
Who is it?

00:17:01.033 --> 00:17:03.066
Moon Shadow.
Moon Shadow?

00:17:03.066 --> 00:17:05.066
How did you escape from
the underground?

00:17:05.066 --> 00:17:06.433
How's everyone doing?

00:17:06.433 --> 00:17:07.566
Don't worry.

00:17:07.566 --> 00:17:09.200
So far, we're all doing fine.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:12.600
That's great.
I was worried.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.066
I can't believe you all
found a way to escape.

00:17:15.066 --> 00:17:17.566
Did you crawl through
the pipes?

00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:19.766
No, we did not.

00:17:19.766 --> 00:17:22.833
And it is only I who escaped.

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:26.866
You mean, my friends
aren't with you? Why not?

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:30.333
The purpose of my mission
is not to rescue the Lancers.

00:17:30.333 --> 00:17:32.866
The purpose of my mission
is to gather up

00:17:32.866 --> 00:17:36.066
as much information as I can
from the underground.

00:17:36.066 --> 00:17:37.733
Your mission?

00:17:37.733 --> 00:17:40.066
Your mission should be about
saving my friends!

00:17:40.066 --> 00:17:42.700
Declan doesn't care about us,
right?

00:17:42.700 --> 00:17:45.300
How could someone
be so selfish!

00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.400
On the contrary.

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:49.800
Huh?
He cares very much.

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.233
We are finding connections
between this world and Fusion.

00:17:53.233 --> 00:17:55.833
Their forces can
trap us into cards,

00:17:55.833 --> 00:17:58.566
and Declan doesn't want that
to happen to the Lancers.

00:17:58.566 --> 00:18:03.700
So for now, the underground is
the safest place for them to be.

00:18:03.700 --> 00:18:05.433
I hope you're right.

00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:07.500
You must trust that I am.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:10.700
I'll be back with an update
on your friends.

00:18:10.700 --> 00:18:13.166
Just make sure you do
whatever it takes

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:14.533
to win the Friendship Cup.

00:18:14.533 --> 00:18:16.533
That's what Declan wants.

00:18:16.533 --> 00:18:18.500
Riley wants that as well.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.200
You saw Riley?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:24.600
Yuya sees that something is
wrong with this world.

00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.266
Yuya thinks that dueling's
about having fun.

00:18:29.266 --> 00:18:33.666
But the people around here only
care about winning and losing.

00:18:33.666 --> 00:18:38.300
So if Yuya wants to change their
minds, he's gotta be a winner.

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.933
He's gotta be...
a winner,

00:18:40.933 --> 00:18:42.966
just as awesome as Jack Atlas!

00:18:42.966 --> 00:18:46.033
It's the only way he'll be
able to get through to them.

00:18:46.033 --> 00:18:49.000
Nobody cared about Jack when
he was from the Commons.

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.066
He was just down there,
miserable, dreaming his dreams,

00:18:52.066 --> 00:18:54.733
but then he got gritty,
and before you knew it,

00:18:54.733 --> 00:18:57.566
he rose to the top
and started putting up W's

00:18:57.566 --> 00:18:59.600
and then won the Friendship Cup.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.033
He was everyone's hero,

00:19:01.033 --> 00:19:02.966
so they listened to whatever
he had to say.

00:19:02.966 --> 00:19:06.000
The only way people are
going to listen to Yuya

00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.800
is if he wins
the Friendship Cup

00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:10.233
to get the chance to duel
against Jack!

00:19:10.233 --> 00:19:13.466
And if he beats Jack, then
he'll be everyone's new
hero.

00:19:14.866 --> 00:19:18.066
And they'll listen to
what he has to say.

00:19:18.066 --> 00:19:22.033
I can't believe Riley
said all that.

00:19:22.033 --> 00:19:23.833
I don't...

00:19:23.833 --> 00:19:26.633
I don't want to
let Riley down,

00:19:26.633 --> 00:19:29.000
but Jack beat me like I was
nothing in our duel.

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.766
I used to think
I could take him,

00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:34.966
but I'm just not sure I can
swing things my way.

00:19:34.966 --> 00:19:38.300
I think I know what
Jack Atlas would suggest.

00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.733
If you've got the stuff, kid,

00:19:40.733 --> 00:19:42.933
then don't be afraid
to use it.

00:19:42.933 --> 00:19:44.966
'Cause when you do,
there won't be anybody

00:19:44.966 --> 00:19:47.133
who'll be able to stop you.

00:19:47.133 --> 00:19:49.933
(gasps)
You're right.

00:19:49.933 --> 00:19:53.066
The only way to show what
dueling's really about

00:19:53.066 --> 00:19:54.966
is to seize the spotlight!

00:19:54.966 --> 00:19:58.866
And the best way to do that is
for me defeat Jack Atlas.

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:01.833
I've been having a hard time
believing I could,

00:20:01.833 --> 00:20:03.333
but not anymore!

00:20:05.033 --> 00:20:07.666
Do one thing for me,
Moon Shadow.

00:20:07.666 --> 00:20:10.633
Tell Riley thanks
and I'll do my best.

00:20:10.633 --> 00:20:13.866
I'll win and show this city
what dueling's really about!

00:20:13.866 --> 00:20:15.400
I will not.
(gasps)

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:17.766
Riley has already gone back
with Declan

00:20:17.766 --> 00:20:19.766
and is locked in council
headquarters.

00:20:19.766 --> 00:20:22.866
I must return underground to
continue my mission.

00:20:22.866 --> 00:20:26.100
Huh? Just a sec...

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:27.800
I have a mission for you.

00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.433
I think it's only close to
impossible.

00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:44.433
Huh?

00:20:55.533 --> 00:20:58.466
(gasps)
This is Yuya's handwriting.

00:20:58.466 --> 00:21:00.700
(Yuya's voice)
"Dear Zuzu.

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.133
"It stinks that I can't see you
in person,

00:21:03.133 --> 00:21:05.500
"but I know you're doing
just fine.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.400
"Hope you're enjoying
the food!

00:21:07.400 --> 00:21:08.633
"Sure beats the burnt waffles

00:21:08.633 --> 00:21:11.000
"your dad makes for us on
Waffle Wednesdays.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.900
"I do miss the sweet syrup he
drowns them in, though.

00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:16.133
"Oh, and speaking of sweet,

00:21:16.133 --> 00:21:17.666
"nice duel, by the way.

00:21:17.666 --> 00:21:19.866
"You looked like a natural on
that Runner.

00:21:19.866 --> 00:21:22.500
"Maybe we can bring one back
with us when we get home.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.000
"That's right.

00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.566
"I'm gonna make sure we get
back home, no matter what.

00:21:26.566 --> 00:21:29.900
"But first, I have to
get through to the people
of this city.

00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.366
"It's a lot tougher than I
thought it would be.

00:21:32.366 --> 00:21:34.066
"I can't believe that
everyone's okay

00:21:34.066 --> 00:21:35.866
"with sending people away
forever.

00:21:35.866 --> 00:21:38.366
"I hoped I could remind everyone
that dueling's

00:21:38.366 --> 00:21:40.766
"about having fun and smiling,

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.100
"but it's hard to do
when I'm having

00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.666
"a hard time smiling
and having fun myself.

00:21:44.666 --> 00:21:47.466
"Losing to Jack was the worst,

00:21:47.466 --> 00:21:49.533
"but seeing you duel and
entertain the crowd

00:21:49.533 --> 00:21:51.400
"turned things around for me.

00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:53.333
"When we all left
to look for you,

00:21:53.333 --> 00:21:56.033
"I made a promise to everyone
that I'd find you,

00:21:56.033 --> 00:21:58.933
"save the galaxy and bring you
home safe and sound.

00:21:58.933 --> 00:22:00.600
"Well, the first part's done.

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.966
"Now I just have to work on the
safe and sound.

00:22:02.966 --> 00:22:06.233
"And that goes for Gong and
Sylvio and everyone else!

00:22:06.233 --> 00:22:09.133
"'Cause I'm not gonna
abandon any of my friends!

00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:12.633
"I'll leave this world a place
where everyone can smile again.

00:22:12.633 --> 00:22:15.866
"And then we can all
go back home...

00:22:15.866 --> 00:22:19.033
and have some of your dad's
burnt waffles!"

00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:20.900
Yum, yum.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.833
I promise to take
center stage, Zuzu,

00:22:23.833 --> 00:22:25.400
by winning the Friendship Cup,

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:27.433
swinging the crowd my way

00:22:27.433 --> 00:22:30.766
and bringing smiles back to the
hearts of everyone!
