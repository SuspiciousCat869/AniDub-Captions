00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:03.800
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.700
(Shay)
The sooner we start,
the sooner I'll finish you off

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.133
and the sooner I can
go after Duel Academy!

00:00:09.133 --> 00:00:11.966
(Crow)
Hope you have a plan B,
'cause I ain't losin'.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:13.366
(Shay and Crow)
Let's Duel!

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.400
(Yuya)
What's this plan
you were talking about?

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.866
And why am I involved?

00:00:16.866 --> 00:00:19.466
Very soon, I will rule
over this city.

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:23.000
In fact, I have already
begun to take control.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.100
Declan!
Riley! You rat!

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.066
Your friends
are safe for now.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.733
I promise no harm
will come to them.

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:34.000
But that guarantee
requires your cooperation.

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.000
(Shay)
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.166
Rise up,
Raidraptor Blaze Falcon!

00:00:43.166 --> 00:00:46.000
Attack Crow directly!
Huh?

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.133
(screaming)

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:50.733
(Melissa)
Crow better pick up
his game quick

00:00:50.733 --> 00:00:54.133
or his Duel Runnin' days
are over.

00:00:54.133 --> 00:00:56.233
(Jean Michel Roget)
I was sent here by Duel Academy

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.766
to prepare this city
for invasion.

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:00.400
But while I carried out
my mission,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.033
I began to love
this world and its people.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:07.866
Join forces with me, Yuya, and
together we will rule this city.

(Melissa)
<i>Check it out, duel fans!</i>

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.166
Crow's got the lead,
but Shay's got a Falcon

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:18.133
lookin' to swoop on in
and change that

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:21.233
since all o' Crows cards
have done gone 'n' flown the
coop.

00:02:21.233 --> 00:02:22.900
Crow's got
some work to do!

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.566
You may think I'm down and out
but you better watch out,

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.200
'cause I'm gonna ground you!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.233
Bring it on!

00:02:28.233 --> 00:02:29.600
And after I get through
with you,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.733
I'm takin' out anyone else
who dares get in my way!

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:35.666
There's one small problem with
your plan. You can't beat me!

00:02:35.666 --> 00:02:37.200
So, good luck, Shay!

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.566
(excited chatter)
Yeah, you tell 'em, Crow!

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.700
You show 'im
who's the boss, Crow!

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.866
Or better yet,
lemme at 'im!

00:02:44.866 --> 00:02:46.800
Watch out,
you can't fly!

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.866
Beat 'im, Crow!

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.833
Move aside, slowpoke!

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.533
That Action Card's mine!

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.866
We'll see about that!

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:00.233
When there are no monsters
out on my field,

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:03.700
I can summon Blackwing Gofu
The Vague Shadow!

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.766
If you thought
getting that Action Card

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.600
was gonna be a breeze,
you were half right!

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:14.500
Missed it.

00:03:16.533 --> 00:03:19.600
When I summon Blackwing
Gofu The Vague Shadow,

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.600
I can also summon two Vague
Shadow Tokens in attack mode!

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.366
And I'm puttin' 'em to use
right away!

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:30.733
I tune Gofu The Vague Shadow
with my two Shadow Tokens!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.666
FYI, Gofu The Vague Shadow
lets me Synchro Summon a monster

00:03:37.666 --> 00:03:39.900
from my graveyard
instead of from my deck!

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.200
From the graveyard?

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.433
Watch as my monsters
unite to fight!

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.200
I...
Synchro Summon!

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.700
Return to the fray,

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:53.766
Assault Blackwing Raikiri
The Rain Shower!

00:03:53.766 --> 00:03:55.766
Gee whiz!
This grave robbin' move

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:57.666
has Crow back in
the driver's seat!

00:03:57.666 --> 00:03:59.400
<i>Listen up, Topsiders,</i>

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.133
your time at the top
is coming to an end

00:04:02.133 --> 00:04:03.600
'cause just like
my monster,

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.366
<i>no matter how many times</i>

00:04:05.366 --> 00:04:07.733
you push us Commons downor
try to get rid of us,

00:04:07.733 --> 00:04:09.500
you'll neverkeep
us down forever.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.166
<i>We'll always bounce back</i>

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:13.266
and fightfor what
we believe in!

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:15.866
None of your speeches are gonna
save you from my attack.

00:04:15.866 --> 00:04:17.933
The onslaught's coming!

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:22.800
You will join forces
with me, correct?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.366
No. No way.

00:04:24.366 --> 00:04:25.433
But why?

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:28.100
If your goal is to
stop Duel Academy,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.233
who can be more helpful
than someone from their world,

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:33.600
someone who knows
their ins‐and‐outs?

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.066
I don't need you.

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.800
Really? So, who are
you going to turn to?

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.733
Surely not the High Council?

00:04:39.733 --> 00:04:41.433
That bunch of
doddering old fools

00:04:41.433 --> 00:04:44.633
aren't in a position
to even help themselves.

00:04:44.633 --> 00:04:46.000
All thanks to you!

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.333
That's right, Yuya.

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:50.366
If I did not act and take
matters into my own hands,

00:04:50.366 --> 00:04:53.100
it would have been
too late for all of us.

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.333
The High Council
can barely decide

00:04:55.333 --> 00:04:57.100
what to eat without debate.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.066
Time is of the essence.

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:02.066
You must be aware
that Duel Academy

00:05:02.066 --> 00:05:06.233
could strike at any moment since
I can't find Dennis MacField.

00:05:06.233 --> 00:05:07.566
(gasping)

00:05:07.566 --> 00:05:12.733
His cover was blown, so I
sent him back to Duel Academy.

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:16.900
Sora sent him back
to the Fusion Dimension,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:19.933
so Dennis probably told them
that Zuzu and Celina are here.

00:05:19.933 --> 00:05:21.733
I would guess yes.

00:05:21.733 --> 00:05:24.600
Don't you find it a little
interesting that Sora

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.200
would allow Dennis
to go back to Duel Academy?

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.333
Why would he do such a thing?

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:30.733
If you're tryin' to say

00:05:30.733 --> 00:05:33.266
that Sora and Dennis are working
together, you're wrong!

00:05:33.266 --> 00:05:34.633
Sora's my friend!

00:05:34.633 --> 00:05:37.533
But wasn't Dennis
your friend too?

00:05:37.533 --> 00:05:40.933
They're Fusion Warriors trained
by the Professor at Duel Academy

00:05:40.933 --> 00:05:44.433
to be ruthless machines
who follows orders!

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:48.533
Zuzu!

00:05:50.066 --> 00:05:51.533
Uh‐oh.

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:53.266
Where'd she run off to?

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.433
I never shoulda
let her out o' my sight!

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:02.566
This whole place is plastered
with security stiffs!

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:04.500
If they find Zuzu,
we're in trouble!

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.733
With a capital
T, R, O, U, B, L, E!

00:06:11.933 --> 00:06:12.866
(gasping)

00:06:13.933 --> 00:06:15.166
(Frankie and Amanda)
Hi, Crow!

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:16.333
Oh, no!

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:18.366
Those jackals
could get hurt up there!

00:06:19.966 --> 00:06:21.666
Oh, boy!
Nice job!

00:06:21.666 --> 00:06:23.100
No climbing!

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.533
Stay on the attack!

00:06:27.566 --> 00:06:29.133
(screaming)

00:06:31.733 --> 00:06:32.933
Zuzu!

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:34.566
She's all right!

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.666
It's time to
make it rain with pain!

00:06:38.666 --> 00:06:39.800
Whoa, time out!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.900
Time out?

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.900
We need to put the brakes
on this duel!

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:45.533
You wanna give up,
feel free, but I'm no quitter!

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:48.866
Raikiri, let's get back
t' the business at hand.

00:06:48.866 --> 00:06:51.600
Use your special ability
to destroy his monster!

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.533
Take out Blaze Falcon!

00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.266
Why won't you listen to me?

00:06:56.266 --> 00:06:59.100
I activate the trap
Raidraptor Reversal!

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.800
Not only does this trap card
protect my Blaze Falcon

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:05.200
from Raikiri's special
ability, it also lets me draw!

00:07:11.766 --> 00:07:15.533
Crow almost de‐feathered
Shay's Falcon! Huh?

00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:19.333
Wait. Why is our kidsome
missing a kid?

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:20.533
Beats me.

00:07:20.533 --> 00:07:23.066
Maybe he ditched us
for some donuts?

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.366
And your friend, Zuzu.

00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:29.500
If you want to protect her
and Celina,

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:31.933
then it's in your best
interest to team with me.

00:07:31.933 --> 00:07:35.400
Under my watchful eye, I will
keep them out of harm's way

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.933
and Duel Academy's reach.

00:07:37.933 --> 00:07:39.700
What do you mean,
keep an eye on them?

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:41.233
You're gonna lock them up?

00:07:41.233 --> 00:07:44.066
Strictly as a precautionary
measure, of course.

00:07:44.066 --> 00:07:47.266
But they'll be well taken
care of. You have my word.

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:49.266
Your word is worthless.

00:07:49.266 --> 00:07:51.400
That stings, Yuya.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:55.033
The fact that you distrust
me so is of great concern.

00:07:55.033 --> 00:07:57.733
Why is it that you
don't believe me?

00:07:57.733 --> 00:08:00.733
'Cause you've done nothing
to earn my trust, Roget.

00:08:00.733 --> 00:08:02.666
You hunted me
and my friends down.

00:08:02.666 --> 00:08:05.066
You locked us up
when all we want to do

00:08:05.066 --> 00:08:07.466
is stop this interdimensional
war from happening,

00:08:07.466 --> 00:08:09.066
and I'm still gonna stop it,

00:08:09.066 --> 00:08:11.966
even if I have to do it
with my own two hands!

00:08:11.966 --> 00:08:13.766
I regret my earlier actions,

00:08:13.766 --> 00:08:16.200
but I had to be certain
of your intentions.

00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.066
You and I are on
the same page, Yuya.

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:22.966
If you can use your talents
to end this crisis peacefully,

00:08:22.966 --> 00:08:24.666
I will be very happy.

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:29.600
You must believe in me, Yuya, or
else there is no moving forward.

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.866
I'm giving my Raikiri an
upgrade that's gonna take you
down!

00:08:39.866 --> 00:08:44.800
I equip Sky Excalibur
on Raikiri!

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.066
So now my Blackwing gains
an extra 400 attack points!

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:51.166
Just listen to me.
Don't attack!

00:08:51.166 --> 00:08:53.000
That's not gonna happen!

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.033
Raikiri,
take out Blaze Falcon!

00:09:01.066 --> 00:09:03.300
Shay was on cruise
controlfor a while,

00:09:03.300 --> 00:09:04.866
but Crowturned
this duel around

00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:06.400
quick enoughto make
your head spin!

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:08.866
If he won't listen,
I'll have to make him listen!

00:09:08.866 --> 00:09:13.466
I activate the spell card
Rank‐Up‐Magic Raptor's Force!

00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:16.533
It brings
my Blaze Falcon back!

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:21.766
Then I overlay
Raidraptor Blaze Falcon

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:25.966
to Xyz Summon a Raid Raptor
that's one Rank higher!

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.766
I wonder what
it's gonna be?

00:09:27.766 --> 00:09:30.600
Fiercest falcon,
set your wings ablaze

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.366
and lock your gaze
on our ill‐fated foe!

00:09:33.366 --> 00:09:35.233
Now, make it so!

00:09:35.233 --> 00:09:38.900
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.833
Emerge, Raidraptor
Revolution Falcon!

00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:48.033
If you're not going to
let me pause this duel,

00:09:48.033 --> 00:09:51.766
then I have to end it now
before things get worse.

00:09:51.766 --> 00:09:54.866
Raidraptor Revolution Falcon's
special ability

00:09:54.866 --> 00:09:58.333
activates destroying your
monster, and dealing you damage

00:09:58.333 --> 00:10:02.200
equal to half of Raikiri The
Rain Shower's attack points.

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:09.166
Your Falcon's blasts
didn't do any damage at all!

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:10.566
You can't mess with Raikiri

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:12.933
as long as Sky Excalibur
is in its hands!

00:10:12.933 --> 00:10:14.600
Stop before it's too late!

00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:19.433
(alarmed cries)

00:10:19.433 --> 00:10:21.066
Terron, no!

00:10:21.066 --> 00:10:25.433
(Melissa)Some kid's gettin'
a piggyback from Crow's
monster!

00:10:25.433 --> 00:10:27.500
This ain't no
amusement park ride!

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:29.066
<i>That boy needs help!</i>

00:10:29.066 --> 00:10:31.533
Terron must've
fallen on its back!

00:10:31.533 --> 00:10:33.500
(alarmed cries)

00:10:33.500 --> 00:10:35.733
I need a parachute!

00:10:35.733 --> 00:10:37.500
They're in a
dillyof a pickle!

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.033
<i>Once the duelin' starts,</i>

00:10:39.033 --> 00:10:41.900
their Duel Runnersare
stuck on autopilot!

00:10:41.900 --> 00:10:43.666
You're gonna be
all right, Terron!

00:10:43.666 --> 00:10:44.866
Just don't let go!

00:10:44.866 --> 00:10:48.866
(alarmed cries)

00:10:49.966 --> 00:10:51.966
I said, don't let go!

00:10:51.966 --> 00:10:54.100
Don't worry, Terron!
I'll catch you!

00:10:56.166 --> 00:11:00.300
Uhh! Can't hold on!

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:01.366
(screaming)

00:11:01.366 --> 00:11:02.733
Terron!

00:11:02.733 --> 00:11:04.700
(screaming)

00:11:04.700 --> 00:11:06.066
Gotcha!

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:08.500
Huh?

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.500
I thought
I was a goner.

00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:13.066
Not this time.

00:11:15.866 --> 00:11:18.133
Crow's gonna
ground you for a week!

00:11:18.133 --> 00:11:21.233
That's prob'ly better that
all this flying around he just
did.

00:11:21.233 --> 00:11:22.533
(all gasping)

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.433
So long, Shay!
That was fun!

00:11:34.266 --> 00:11:36.100
That was amazing.

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:45.900
(thinking) I can't believe
he was able to save Terron!

00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.700
I totally woulda been a pancake
if it wasn't for Shay.

00:11:58.700 --> 00:12:00.433
Y' know,
he's not that scary.

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:01.600
Really?

00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.733
I can't believe
he helped.

00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:05.866
Maybe we read him
all wrong.

00:12:05.866 --> 00:12:10.533
I think that way deep down,
he's a lot like Crow!

00:12:10.533 --> 00:12:14.600
He likes to act tough and rough,
but it's all for show.

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:18.300
On the inside, he's as warm
and fuzzy as a baby chick.

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:22.700
Sorry I didn't get
what you were drivin' at.

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.000
Thought you were
messin' around.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:27.266
Thanks for savin'
the little jackal.

00:12:27.266 --> 00:12:30.266
You don't have to
thank me, Crow.

00:12:30.266 --> 00:12:32.700
I only did
what needed to be done.

00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.866
Just like I need to
take down Duel Academy

00:12:34.866 --> 00:12:38.033
and you need to
take down the Topsiders.

00:12:38.033 --> 00:12:41.233
Huh! I guess even though
we have different enemies,

00:12:41.233 --> 00:12:43.500
we're sort o' fighting
for the same thing.

00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.633
Good luck trying to take down
all of those Duel Academy thugs.

00:12:46.633 --> 00:12:49.200
It doesn't sound
like it's gonna be easy.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.700
You could say the same thing
about you and the Commons

00:12:51.700 --> 00:12:53.900
trying to change things
in this dimension.

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:57.100
Yeah. I guess we both
have our work cut out for us.

00:12:57.100 --> 00:12:58.633
That we do!

00:12:58.633 --> 00:13:01.166
Okay, let's out
the pedal to the metal!

00:13:01.166 --> 00:13:03.500
Shay, no holding back!

00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.666
I wouldn't think of it!

00:13:11.133 --> 00:13:13.200
(Melissa)
<i>Talk about excitement!</i>

00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:16.200
I still can't believe how
thatboy hopped on a monster's
back

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:18.200
<i>like he was rodeo rider!</i>

00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:21.566
But that buckin' bronco
ain't puttin' a kibosh on
this duel!

00:13:21.566 --> 00:13:23.433
It's my move!

00:13:23.433 --> 00:13:27.233
I activate the spell
Rank‐Up‐Magic Skip Force

00:13:27.233 --> 00:13:30.133
I overlay
Raidraptor Revolution Falcon

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:33.733
to Xyz Summon a Raidraptor
that's two Ranks higher!

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.033
How remarkable!

00:13:37.033 --> 00:13:39.900
When Shay ranks up a Monster,
he doesn't mess around!

00:13:39.900 --> 00:13:42.600
When you've seen as much
real combat as I have,

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.466
you learn one thing. If you
want to stay in the game,

00:13:45.466 --> 00:13:47.333
you have to keep
pushing to the edge!

00:13:47.333 --> 00:13:50.033
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:13:50.033 --> 00:13:51.533
You're cleared for takeoff,

00:13:51.533 --> 00:13:54.633
Raidraptor Satellite
Cannon Falcon!

00:13:56.666 --> 00:13:59.933
That Falcon's attack
pointsare in an orbit of their
own!

00:13:59.933 --> 00:14:03.366
Not bad, Shay, but not good
enough to take out my Raikiri!

00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:04.800
But there's more to come.

00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:06.966
More of what?
This!

00:14:06.966 --> 00:14:10.433
By sending Rank‐Up‐Magic
Raid Force to my graveyard,

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.033
I can add
the Rank‐Up‐Magic Skip Force

00:14:12.033 --> 00:14:14.333
that's in my graveyard
to my hand!

00:14:14.333 --> 00:14:17.433
Then I'll activate
Rank‐Up‐Magic Skip Force

00:14:17.433 --> 00:14:19.400
to put my next move
in motion.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:21.866
I overlay Satellite
Cannon Falcon

00:14:21.866 --> 00:14:23.966
to build
the Overlay Network!

00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:30.433
You've seen my Blaze,
Revolution,

00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:33.233
and Satellite Falcons,
but now you're going to witness

00:14:33.233 --> 00:14:36.466
the next evolutionary step
in my aerial arsenal!

00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:39.133
Go, Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:43.300
Rise up, Raidraptor
Ultimate Falcon!

00:14:44.633 --> 00:14:47.333
I activate Ultimate Falcon's
special ability!

00:14:47.333 --> 00:14:50.700
By using one Overlay Unit,
Ultimate Falcon

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.400
negates the effects
of all cards

00:14:52.400 --> 00:14:55.366
and lowers their attack
points by 1,000!

00:14:57.966 --> 00:14:59.466
It's go time!

00:14:59.466 --> 00:15:03.933
Ultimate Falcon take to the
skies and take out Raikiri!

00:15:03.933 --> 00:15:06.333
Broadside Barrage!

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:21.666
(all)
Huh?

00:15:22.733 --> 00:15:23.766
This is intense!

00:15:23.766 --> 00:15:25.233
Best duel ever!

00:15:27.566 --> 00:15:29.066
I have to admit,
I didn't think

00:15:29.066 --> 00:15:31.933
you'd have enough firepower
t' take out Raikiri.

00:15:31.933 --> 00:15:35.066
But because you did, I have
to send it to my Extra Deck.

00:15:35.066 --> 00:15:36.666
Well,
that's good news for me,

00:15:36.666 --> 00:15:39.333
because now that you don't have
any monsters on your field,

00:15:39.333 --> 00:15:41.933
Ultimate Falcon's
special ability kicks in

00:15:41.933 --> 00:15:44.200
and you lose
1,000 life points,

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:46.466
and that means
that you lose the duel!

00:15:46.466 --> 00:15:49.433
Crow better have a
quickresponse or he's
hist'ry!

00:15:49.433 --> 00:15:50.933
When you blasted Raikiri,

00:15:50.933 --> 00:15:53.100
Sky Excalibur
was sent to my graveyard,

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:55.033
but I can still
draw from its power!

00:15:55.033 --> 00:15:57.166
I can bring back
a blast from the past

00:15:57.166 --> 00:15:59.500
and summon a Tuner Monster
from my graveyard.

00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:03.433
Welcome back,
Oroshi The Squall!

00:16:03.433 --> 00:16:05.033
That bird can't save you,

00:16:05.033 --> 00:16:07.566
because Ultimate Falcon
renders it useless!

00:16:07.566 --> 00:16:09.333
Just accept that it's over!

00:16:09.333 --> 00:16:10.966
(Melissa)
It looks like Shay
is right!

00:16:10.966 --> 00:16:13.266
Crow is still
hangin' on by his talons,

00:16:13.266 --> 00:16:16.566
but his Oroshi doesn't
stand achance against Ultimate
Falcon!

00:16:16.566 --> 00:16:18.866
Plus, he's all out o'
spell and trap cards!

00:16:18.866 --> 00:16:20.633
For Crow
to pull off an upset,

00:16:20.633 --> 00:16:23.800
first he'll have t'
pull off a miracle!

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:25.833
Oh, I will!

00:16:25.833 --> 00:16:27.533
I draw!

00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:32.500
Now we're talkin'!

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.900
Since there's a Blackwing
already on my field,

00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:38.200
I can summon Blackwing
Bora The Spear!

00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.666
Oroshi The Squall
tunes Bora The Spear!

00:16:51.333 --> 00:16:53.066
I Synchro Summon

00:16:53.066 --> 00:16:56.933
Assault Blackwing
Sohaya The Rain Storm!

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.233
And when I summon this
awesome bird to my side,

00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:03.733
I can bring back
another Assault Blackwing

00:17:03.733 --> 00:17:05.366
straight from my graveyard!

00:17:05.366 --> 00:17:08.200
Say hey to Sayo
The Rain Hider!

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.100
Sohaya The Rain Storm
counts as a Tuner Monster,

00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:14.133
'n' that means
I can Synchro Summon again!

00:17:15.666 --> 00:17:19.866
Sohaya The Rain Storm
tunes Sayo The Rain Hider!

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:24.100
I Synchro Summon

00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:28.833
Assault Blackwing
Raikiri The Rain Shower!

00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:29.966
<i>My!</i>

00:17:29.966 --> 00:17:32.166
That symphony
of Synchro Summonin'

00:17:32.166 --> 00:17:35.333
was certainly somethin'
else, wasn't it, folks?

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:37.900
One more move
and this duel's over!

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.033
Since I have
a monster on my field,

00:17:40.033 --> 00:17:43.366
Raikiri can destroy
one of your cards!

00:17:43.366 --> 00:17:46.100
Your Ultimate Falcon
is finished!

00:17:49.733 --> 00:17:51.833
Your Ultimate Falcon
is finished!

00:17:51.833 --> 00:17:53.900
It took a lot of effort
to revive Raikiri.

00:17:53.900 --> 00:17:55.333
But it was all for nothing,

00:17:55.333 --> 00:17:58.433
'cause Ultimate Falcon's
immune to its special ability!

00:17:59.866 --> 00:18:01.200
It's no biggie!

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.300
Just like us Commons,
my Blackwings

00:18:03.300 --> 00:18:05.433
can call upon their friends
whenever they need help!

00:18:05.433 --> 00:18:06.666
What are you plannin' to do?

00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:07.866
Oh, you'll see!

00:18:07.866 --> 00:18:11.200
Sohaya's super special,
'cause its special ability

00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.000
activates from my graveyard.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000
So if I banish one, I can summon
the other one to my field!

00:18:24.266 --> 00:18:27.066
And since I used a Blackwing
to summon Raikiri,

00:18:27.066 --> 00:18:29.466
it can be treated
as a Tuner Monster.

00:18:29.466 --> 00:18:32.600
I'm about to kick
the duel into high gear,

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.666
so I'll have Raikiri go ahead

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:37.200
and tune
my Sohaya The Rain Storm!

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.600
Get ready to feast your eyes
on a thundering display of power

00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.000
that will have you shaking
in your duel disk!

00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:46.066
I Synchro Summon...

00:18:48.666 --> 00:18:53.233
Assault Blackwing
Onimaru The Divine Thunder!

00:18:57.233 --> 00:18:59.966
Now, friends, I have
seen some amazin' sights,

00:18:59.966 --> 00:19:02.633
but this one certainly
soars above em' all!

00:19:02.633 --> 00:19:06.166
I've never seen someone
Synchro Summon so many
times!

00:19:06.166 --> 00:19:07.900
He's proved once
an' for all

00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:11.600
that folks from the Commons
make for truly dandy
duelists!

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:12.966
Time to take flight!

00:19:12.966 --> 00:19:16.600
Onimaru, finish Ultimate Falcon
once and for all!

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.433
Onimaru's special ability
will now kick in.

00:19:19.433 --> 00:19:21.400
That means
the power of its attack

00:19:21.400 --> 00:19:23.133
will increase by 1,000 points

00:19:23.133 --> 00:19:26.733
for each Synchro Summon
I made this turn!

00:19:26.733 --> 00:19:28.333
With this final attack,

00:19:28.333 --> 00:19:31.133
the true power of the Commons
reveals itself!

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.200
Thundering Thrash!

00:19:47.833 --> 00:19:49.733
<i>Crow soars to victory!</i>

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:50.733
Huh?

00:19:50.733 --> 00:19:53.733
(cheering)

00:20:02.833 --> 00:20:05.500
(Melissa)
This whole stadium
has been electrified

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.400
by Crow's
thunderin' thrashin'!

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.933
(cheering)

00:20:09.933 --> 00:20:11.866
Thank you!

00:20:11.866 --> 00:20:13.966
Crow!

00:20:13.966 --> 00:20:16.100
If Crow can overcome
the odds like that,

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:18.400
well, then
all of us Commons can!

00:20:22.466 --> 00:20:23.600
(laughing)

00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:24.533
Huh?

00:20:33.833 --> 00:20:37.733
Our duel may be over, but our
missions have just started.

00:20:37.733 --> 00:20:39.566
We each have enemies
to overcome,

00:20:39.566 --> 00:20:41.200
and it won't be easy
for either of us.

00:20:41.200 --> 00:20:43.666
But after today,
I'll be ready for them!

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:52.000
Hey, Shay!

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.433
Stay strong, my friend.

00:21:06.400 --> 00:21:08.866
I'm with you guys, too!

00:21:10.366 --> 00:21:12.566
I'll never join you, Roget.

00:21:12.566 --> 00:21:14.900
Zuzu Boyle
was spotted at the track.

00:21:14.900 --> 00:21:16.800
Capture her immediately.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:18.000
No!

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.533
You better
leave Zuzu alone!

00:21:20.533 --> 00:21:22.933
Unhand me!

00:21:22.933 --> 00:21:26.366
(groaning)

00:21:26.366 --> 00:21:28.000
Leave Zuzu alone!

00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:31.366
I knew I couldn't trust you,
Roget, you snake!

00:21:31.366 --> 00:21:34.266
I won't let you
hurt my friends!

00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:37.200
If you do,
then you'll answer to me!

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:44.266
I offered my friendship,
but Yuya rejected me.

00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:46.566
What a pity.

00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:51.966
I better find Zuzu soon,

00:21:51.966 --> 00:21:54.733
before it's too late
for both of us!

00:21:59.966 --> 00:22:01.800
(groaning)

00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:03.133
Enjoy your stay!

00:22:03.133 --> 00:22:04.266
(groaning)
