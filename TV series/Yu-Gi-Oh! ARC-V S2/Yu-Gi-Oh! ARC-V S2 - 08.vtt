WEBVTT

00:00:00.966 --> 00:00:04.400
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V..."

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.233
You arrest
the small fry.

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.966
Yes, sir!

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.833
Take it easy!
Let's talk this out first!

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:13.033
We don't wanna
make any trouble!

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:14.366
You already have.

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:16.000
We're taking the whole lot
o' you Commons in

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.666
for trespassing
into Tops Villa Area.

00:00:18.666 --> 00:00:19.966
But we just got here!

00:00:19.966 --> 00:00:21.300
Then we'll give
you newcomers

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.733
a free tour
of the detention center.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:24.833
You're gonna love
The Facility.

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:26.133
(grunting)

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:28.133
I guess I have no choice!

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.566
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:32.700
Marksman Heiji... attack!

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.733
(yelping)

00:00:34.733 --> 00:00:35.966
Surrender while you can

00:00:35.966 --> 00:00:37.733
and maybe we won't throw
the whole book at you.

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.933
Sorry, but that isn't
part of the plan.

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:43.833
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:46.100
Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.066
Fusion...
Interesting.

00:00:48.066 --> 00:00:51.400
Send additional security units
to Sector D‐8.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.100
(Jean‐Michel Roger)
Who are these duelists?

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.266
They use Action Cards
and Fusion Summon...

00:01:01.266 --> 00:01:03.300
and what is this Pendulum thing?

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.833
(menacing chuckle)

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.366
(strange rumbling)

00:01:10.866 --> 00:01:12.966
(man)
Leave these
people alone!

00:01:12.966 --> 00:01:15.100
Raikiri, cut open a path!

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.433
(thunder booming)

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.433
(alarmed shouting)

00:01:25.266 --> 00:01:26.966
Thank you....

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:28.533
I think....

(children laughing)

00:02:33.933 --> 00:02:36.233
There's no sign of
the fugitives in Sector B.

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:43.333
That should do the trick.

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.633
Nobody will find you now.

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:46.766
Wait!

00:02:46.766 --> 00:02:49.000
This place is crawling
with Sector Security.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Their eyes are...
everywhere.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.933
Sorry, I thought
we were safe.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:57.066
No, once you would have been,
but now the Topsiders

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:00.400
are making sure Sector Security
is down here 24/7.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:06.200
If I had a card for every time
Sector Security

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.000
treated me fairly,
I'd have no cards.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.400
And then they'd fine me
for having no cards!

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.566
Yugo!

00:03:12.566 --> 00:03:15.300
I totally get why Sector
Security and the Topsiders

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.833
make you angry,
but you and this world

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.833
have a much bigger problem‐‐
the Fusion Dimension.

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:22.800
And the only way
you're going to defeat them

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.233
is if you all work together.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.866
Anyone meet a kid
named Yuya!?

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:31.433
Anyone...?

00:03:31.433 --> 00:03:34.500
'Bout yay tall...
I don't even
have one bar?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.433
I guess my calling plan doesn't
have coverage in this dimension.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.833
Yo, Dennis!
Little help please?

00:03:40.833 --> 00:03:42.000
Yes, sir!

00:03:43.966 --> 00:03:45.866
That sun has sunburn written
all over it.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.666
Ta‐da!

00:03:50.666 --> 00:03:52.233
(boy)
Did y' see that, Dad!?

00:03:52.233 --> 00:03:54.733
Hey! That trick was amazing!

00:03:54.733 --> 00:03:58.166
Abraca‐thank you!

00:03:58.166 --> 00:04:00.333
Look Dad, I just made
your money disappear.

00:04:05.533 --> 00:04:08.133
(Dennis, VO)
I just got
a million dollar idea!

00:04:16.633 --> 00:04:18.733
I'm impressed, pal.

00:04:18.733 --> 00:04:21.166
I saw how you stood up
t' those Sector Security goons

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:22.700
t' protect the kid.

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:25.433
Any duelist who helps
the helpless is okay by me!

00:04:25.433 --> 00:04:27.233
You definitely
got some guts!

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.533
Sorry, but, uh,
who are you?

00:04:29.533 --> 00:04:31.366
Welcome back, Crow!

00:04:31.366 --> 00:04:32.500
'Sup, Amanda!

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.133
Where's Frankie
and Terron?

00:04:35.133 --> 00:04:36.633
In New Domino.

00:04:36.633 --> 00:04:39.600
They wanted t' help you scrounge
up more supplies for a change.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.900
Seriously?

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:43.266
Uh...

00:04:44.533 --> 00:04:46.400
You coming in or what?

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:50.400
(Crow)
You thought we wouldn't be able
to eat tonight, well now we can!

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.466
Awesome!

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:53.833
Tuna feast sandwiches coming up!

00:04:53.833 --> 00:04:55.866
You four wanna join us
for some chow?

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:58.066
Of course they do!

00:04:58.066 --> 00:04:59.733
Hmm.
Huh?

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.233
I haven't seen
you guys before.

00:05:05.233 --> 00:05:06.566
Where y' from?

00:05:06.566 --> 00:05:09.366
Well, actually‐‐
Thanks for saving
our bacon!

00:05:09.366 --> 00:05:10.633
Ok...

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:13.000
I would've taken control
of the situation, of course,

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.366
but I guess leapfrogging across
dimensions wore me out!

00:05:16.366 --> 00:05:17.666
Uh, you leapfrogged
from where?

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.200
Paradise City.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.033
I'm Sylvio Sawatari and back
in the Standard Dimension

00:05:22.033 --> 00:05:24.333
I'm a dueling superstar.

00:05:24.333 --> 00:05:27.500
And this is Yuya Sakaki,
my personal assistant.

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.533
What?!

00:05:28.533 --> 00:05:31.266
And this li'l firecracker
here is Celina.

00:05:31.266 --> 00:05:33.433
She comes from a whole
different dimension.

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:34.566
Oh, yeah?

00:05:34.566 --> 00:05:35.866
Looks like when
I picked up the tuna,

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:38.400
I brought a few nuts along, too.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.466
Look I know it's hard
to believe,

00:05:40.466 --> 00:05:43.066
but we traveled to your
dimension to find duelists

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:44.933
who can help us
save the galaxy.

00:05:44.933 --> 00:05:46.300
Sure, sure.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.133
Look I can't wrap my head
around your particular

00:05:48.133 --> 00:05:50.833
brand of "crazy",
but you guys seem okay to me.

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.166
Anyway, if y' need
a place to crash...

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.466
you're welcome t' stay.

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.966
Your attention, please...

00:05:59.966 --> 00:06:02.033
Our show is ready
to begin!

00:06:02.033 --> 00:06:04.000
One... two...

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.466
three!

00:06:10.033 --> 00:06:12.666
(gasping)

00:06:12.666 --> 00:06:14.333
Whoa!
Look!

00:06:14.333 --> 00:06:15.600
C'mon, Terron.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:16.600
We don't have
time for this.

00:06:17.933 --> 00:06:19.666
You ought to be
ashamed o' yourself!

00:06:19.666 --> 00:06:22.766
You'd rather make yourself
rich than find Yuya!

00:06:22.766 --> 00:06:24.333
Who needs to find Yuya?

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:25.700
We do!

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.933
All we have to do is
attract lots of attention

00:06:27.933 --> 00:06:30.466
and Yuya and the others
will findus.

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:32.400
You really think
that could work?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.400
I have no idea...
but it's worth a try!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.500
Please listen to me!

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.600
The future of your
entire world is at stake!

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.366
There's an interdimensional
war raging...

00:06:43.366 --> 00:06:44.933
Must be some kind o'
performance art.

00:06:44.933 --> 00:06:46.933
Then she needs
better material.

00:06:46.933 --> 00:06:48.833
It's only a matter of time
till Obelisk Force

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:50.300
attacks your dimension.

00:06:50.300 --> 00:06:52.466
Please listen.
This is serious!

00:06:52.466 --> 00:06:54.333
You have to believe me!

00:06:54.333 --> 00:06:56.466
When they attack,
they can turn you

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:58.700
into a card just like them!

00:06:58.700 --> 00:06:59.733
(laughing)

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:03.533
I knew this would be
a tough sell...

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:06.633
but it's starting to look
downright impossible.

00:07:06.633 --> 00:07:08.100
What's so funny?

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:11.233
Is the end of the world really
that hysterical to you?

00:07:11.233 --> 00:07:12.833
I mean, I've travelled
to other dimensions

00:07:12.833 --> 00:07:14.533
and seen the aftermath.

00:07:14.533 --> 00:07:17.633
Then prove it and hop
to another dimension right now!

00:07:17.633 --> 00:07:19.733
Honey, please!
Don't encourage them!

00:07:19.733 --> 00:07:20.666
(hecklers laughing)

00:07:20.666 --> 00:07:22.766
Fine!
You want proof!?

00:07:22.766 --> 00:07:26.466
Then I'll be more than happy
to give it to you wise guy!

00:07:26.466 --> 00:07:28.966
What're we
stopping here for?

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:29.933
For an opportunity.

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.600
Now Clear Wing Synchro Dragon...
put these skeptics to shame

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.333
and send me away...
show them your true powers...

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.033
(male heckler)
Nice try....

00:07:52.688 --> 00:07:54.488
(male heckler)
You showed us...

00:07:54.488 --> 00:07:55.988
Is your dragon invisible?

00:07:55.988 --> 00:07:57.788
No it's not invisible!

00:07:57.788 --> 00:08:00.888
(man #2)
Look, bub, quit harassing my
customers with your nonsense.

00:08:00.888 --> 00:08:03.621
Maybe you'd like to share your
story with Sector Security!

00:08:03.621 --> 00:08:05.721
(girl)
Hey, that's our lunch!

00:08:05.721 --> 00:08:07.788
Come back here,
y' little crooks!

00:08:07.788 --> 00:08:09.688
Now's our chance!
Come on!

00:08:09.688 --> 00:08:11.555
And don't come back!

00:08:11.555 --> 00:08:12.788
(laughing)

00:08:12.788 --> 00:08:17.388
Crow's gonna be
so proud of us!

00:08:17.388 --> 00:08:19.255
Hey, Crow!
You here!?

00:08:19.255 --> 00:08:21.588
Yeah! What've you slackers
been up to?

00:08:21.588 --> 00:08:23.555
Ta‐da!

00:08:23.555 --> 00:08:24.921
Where'd you get
this stuff?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:26.355
Oh, from a café.

00:08:26.355 --> 00:08:28.188
Yeah, we ordered
"take out"!

00:08:28.188 --> 00:08:30.988
What made you think it was okay
t' start stealing!?

00:08:30.988 --> 00:08:33.721
'Cause...
We just wanted t' pull
our own weight.

00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.121
And what good
will that do you

00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:37.455
if it lands you both
in The Facility?

00:08:37.455 --> 00:08:40.155
Those coppers mentioned
that place, what is it?

00:08:40.155 --> 00:08:41.921
It's a place
you never wanna visit.

00:08:43.288 --> 00:08:47.655
Let's just say it makes doin'
hard time look easy!

00:08:47.655 --> 00:08:51.288
It's like a home away from home
for us Commons.

00:08:51.288 --> 00:08:54.155
See, there are two classes
of people in this city‐‐

00:08:54.155 --> 00:08:56.588
you're either a Topsider
or a Common.

00:08:56.588 --> 00:08:58.888
Topsiders live in luxury
and have everything

00:08:58.888 --> 00:09:00.521
they could possibly need...

00:09:00.521 --> 00:09:03.788
while us Commons are forced
t' live in their shadows.

00:09:03.788 --> 00:09:05.288
We're always
struggling to survive,

00:09:05.288 --> 00:09:08.788
so we live off whatever
we can scrape up.

00:09:08.788 --> 00:09:11.221
If you even try to question
the way things are run,

00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:12.955
Sector Security
won't think twice

00:09:12.955 --> 00:09:14.788
about throwing you
into The Facility,

00:09:14.788 --> 00:09:18.655
and marking you so that everyone
knows you paid a visit there.

00:09:18.655 --> 00:09:20.555
That's terrible.

00:09:20.555 --> 00:09:23.155
Yeah, but for right now
it is what it is.

00:09:23.155 --> 00:09:25.621
The important thing now
is to survive.

00:09:25.621 --> 00:09:27.221
That means we have
t' stick together

00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:28.955
and help each other
any way we can,

00:09:28.955 --> 00:09:31.021
but that doesn't
mean you should steal!

00:09:31.021 --> 00:09:34.455
Hey, how'd you two
get here so fast?

00:09:34.455 --> 00:09:37.488
(Terron)
And have time to change
your outfits and hairdos?

00:09:37.488 --> 00:09:38.955
Terron, what're you
talking about?

00:09:38.955 --> 00:09:40.188
Don't interrupt!

00:09:40.188 --> 00:09:42.721
Weren't you two
like just at the café?

00:09:42.721 --> 00:09:45.588
They must have
seen Zuzu.
Yeah!

00:09:45.588 --> 00:09:48.088
And the one who
looks like me musta been Yugo.

00:09:48.088 --> 00:09:49.821
This café,
where is it?

00:09:49.821 --> 00:09:51.688
Guys, what is going on?

00:09:51.688 --> 00:09:54.855
They saw our friends
and we have t' find them.

00:09:54.855 --> 00:09:57.788
Sector Security has you four
on their radar now.

00:09:57.788 --> 00:10:00.188
If you go wandering into
the city, they'll find you!

00:10:03.055 --> 00:10:05.388
So you stay here.
I'll track 'em down.

00:10:07.155 --> 00:10:09.388
Howdy‐doo,
all you city slickers!

00:10:09.388 --> 00:10:10.988
<i>It's Melissa Trail here!</i>

00:10:10.988 --> 00:10:12.788
And, as usual,
I'm here t' round up

00:10:12.788 --> 00:10:16.155
all the latest trends thatare
stampedin' our metropolis!

00:10:16.155 --> 00:10:19.088
Like the young magic‐slinger
who's mesmerizin' crowds

00:10:19.088 --> 00:10:20.788
in this here
Midway Park!

00:10:20.788 --> 00:10:22.321
<i>Let's take a gander!</i>

00:10:22.321 --> 00:10:25.055
Time to raise the curtain
on the next show, Gongster!

00:10:25.055 --> 00:10:27.521
We don't have a curtain
and Gong's leavin' this park

00:10:27.521 --> 00:10:29.188
t' search for Yuya!

00:10:29.188 --> 00:10:31.355
But, we're attracting
TV coverage!

00:10:31.355 --> 00:10:35.255
If we put on a great show,
I'm sure Yuya will see us on TV!

00:10:35.255 --> 00:10:38.721
And that's a chance
we can't pass up.

00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:42.021
That'd only be true
if we were dueling.

00:10:42.021 --> 00:10:43.921
All right then.
So let's duel.

00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:45.021
What!?

00:10:45.021 --> 00:10:46.855
I bet all the kids
in this crowd would love

00:10:46.855 --> 00:10:48.888
to see a superhero duel!

00:10:48.888 --> 00:10:50.555
You pullin'
my pompadour?

00:10:50.555 --> 00:10:53.688
I'll play the dashing hero and
you'll be the grumpy bad guy.

00:10:53.688 --> 00:10:54.755
Gong's no grump!

00:10:54.755 --> 00:10:56.388
(grumbling)

00:10:56.388 --> 00:10:57.955
Wait! Gong didn't accept!

00:10:57.955 --> 00:10:59.021
Too late!

00:10:59.021 --> 00:11:01.921
I activate the Action Field,
Crossover!

00:11:03.021 --> 00:11:04.788
Gong's gonna make you
regret this!

00:11:07.688 --> 00:11:08.721
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:11:08.721 --> 00:11:10.721
(robotic voice)
<i>Action Cards dispersed...</i>

00:11:10.721 --> 00:11:12.121
But first,
I gotta make you dress

00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:14.188
the part of a supervillain!

00:11:14.188 --> 00:11:17.321
I think the spell Hot Surprise
should do the trick!

00:11:17.321 --> 00:11:19.955
It lets me summon a Fire
Attribute Monster to your field

00:11:19.955 --> 00:11:21.988
to set you ablaze
with badness!

00:11:21.988 --> 00:11:25.188
Kids, look at his evil sidekick,
Performage Plushfire,

00:11:25.188 --> 00:11:27.955
with its whistle
of infinite calamity!

00:11:27.955 --> 00:11:30.188
Gong's gonna crush you
for ruin'...

00:11:30.188 --> 00:11:31.888
You're really getting
into the role!

00:11:31.888 --> 00:11:33.221
Stay back, please!

00:11:33.221 --> 00:11:35.721
Gong the Goon
is a ruthless brute!

00:11:35.721 --> 00:11:37.755
Don't worry though,
'cause I can extinguish

00:11:37.755 --> 00:11:39.788
the threat with
a monster card...

00:11:39.788 --> 00:11:42.355
namely, Performage Wind Drainer!

00:11:45.855 --> 00:11:49.221
(Melissa Trail)
Our performin' buckaroos
have just pulled a switcheroo,

00:11:49.221 --> 00:11:51.321
'cause rather than puttin' on
a magic show,

00:11:51.321 --> 00:11:54.855
they've done decided t' stage
a rip‐roarin' card duel!

00:11:57.021 --> 00:11:59.755
Now... I, Dennis the Defender,

00:11:59.755 --> 00:12:03.555
will protect this park...
from my evil archenemy!

00:12:03.555 --> 00:12:07.288
I activate the spell
Performance Mage Hurricane!

00:12:07.288 --> 00:12:10.221
It blows my spell card
back to my hand!

00:12:10.221 --> 00:12:13.455
(wind blowing)

00:12:13.455 --> 00:12:16.021
And now that I've snatched back
Hot Surprise,

00:12:16.021 --> 00:12:18.755
Performage Plushfire is
destroyed and you,

00:12:18.755 --> 00:12:22.521
Gong the Goon, take 400 points
of devastating damage!

00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:25.188
Your evil schemes
are extinguished!

00:12:25.188 --> 00:12:27.721
You poor pathetic excuse
for a duelist!

00:12:27.721 --> 00:12:30.255
Dennis the Defender just gave
that fire‐slinger

00:12:30.255 --> 00:12:31.755
<i>a good thumpin'!</i>

00:12:31.755 --> 00:12:33.788
And saved us from
Gong the Goon!

00:12:33.788 --> 00:12:36.221
That's what us
superheroes are for!

00:12:36.221 --> 00:12:37.721
(Gong)
Cut it out!
Huh?

00:12:39.188 --> 00:12:41.421
The only thing super
about you...

00:12:41.421 --> 00:12:44.155
is how super sorry you'll be
when Gong's through with you!

00:12:44.155 --> 00:12:45.321
But, Gong...

00:12:45.321 --> 00:12:46.555
You're more interested

00:12:46.555 --> 00:12:49.121
in hoggin' the spotlight
than findin' our friend!

00:12:49.121 --> 00:12:51.555
Gong's gonna knock
some sense into you!

00:12:51.555 --> 00:12:53.555
You can't be serious.
Gong is!

00:12:53.555 --> 00:12:55.555
When the dust settles,
your showboatin' days

00:12:55.555 --> 00:12:58.121
are gonna be
permanently over!

00:12:58.121 --> 00:12:59.821
Now Listen t' Gong, y'all!

00:12:59.821 --> 00:13:01.888
That clown is no hero!

00:13:01.888 --> 00:13:03.655
He tried t' make
Gong look bad,

00:13:03.655 --> 00:13:06.488
but Dennis there
is the real wrongdoer!

00:13:06.488 --> 00:13:08.121
You mean...
he tricked us?

00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:11.021
Yeah, but Gong'll slam that
fraud like a tidal wave!

00:13:11.021 --> 00:13:13.488
(grunting)

00:13:13.488 --> 00:13:15.021
(excited chattering)

00:13:16.955 --> 00:13:19.621
Well, if it makes
'em happy...

00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:21.721
(angry snorting)
(wicked laughing)

00:13:21.721 --> 00:13:24.121
So you exposed my plot!

00:13:24.121 --> 00:13:27.188
I am actually the notorious
uber‐villain

00:13:27.188 --> 00:13:30.088
Dennis the Destroyer!

00:13:30.088 --> 00:13:32.788
But it's already too late,
Super Gong!

00:13:32.788 --> 00:13:36.321
You and your foolish fans...
are all doomed!

00:13:49.702 --> 00:13:50.969
You're through!

00:13:50.969 --> 00:13:53.669
Dennis the Destroyer
thinks not!

00:13:53.669 --> 00:13:56.336
Since I have Performage Wind
Drainer my Mage's Fortress

00:13:56.336 --> 00:13:59.102
prevents you from attacking me,
you super zero!

00:13:59.102 --> 00:14:00.302
Aww man!

00:14:00.302 --> 00:14:01.869
(sinister chuckle)

00:14:01.869 --> 00:14:04.536
I am far more powerful
than you imagine!

00:14:04.536 --> 00:14:07.036
You have no hope
of prevailing!

00:14:08.502 --> 00:14:10.802
(shouting)

00:14:10.802 --> 00:14:13.436
Woo, that's one doozy
of a draw!

00:14:13.436 --> 00:14:16.169
I'm sending this
Superheavy Samurai Soulhorns

00:14:16.169 --> 00:14:18.102
straight t' the graveyard...

00:14:18.102 --> 00:14:19.802
so I can summon
the Tuner Monster...

00:14:19.802 --> 00:14:21.969
Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter!

00:14:24.536 --> 00:14:28.136
And it'll be joined by
Superheavy Samurai Scales!

00:14:29.202 --> 00:14:30.436
And when Gong summons

00:14:30.436 --> 00:14:33.002
Superheavy Samurai Scales,
Gong can summon

00:14:33.002 --> 00:14:35.869
a Superheavy Samurai
from his graveyard.

00:14:35.869 --> 00:14:38.769
Come on back,
Superheavy Samurai Soulhorns!

00:14:40.602 --> 00:14:42.802
I tune Superheavy
Samurai Trumpeter

00:14:42.802 --> 00:14:45.402
with Superheavy Samurai Scales!

00:14:45.402 --> 00:14:47.736
Once Gong completes this move,
you're going to wish you

00:14:47.736 --> 00:14:49.669
never tricked Gong
into duelin' ya!

00:14:51.636 --> 00:14:53.536
Gong Synchro Summons!

00:14:53.536 --> 00:14:56.202
Put this double‐dealin'
conman on the ropes,

00:14:56.202 --> 00:15:00.602
Superheavy Samurai
Ogre Shutendoji!

00:15:00.602 --> 00:15:01.536
Go get 'im, Gong!

00:15:01.536 --> 00:15:02.802
With pleasure!

00:15:02.802 --> 00:15:05.236
Gong's got some real bad news
for you, Macfield,

00:15:05.236 --> 00:15:06.502
'cause my Ogre's
special ability

00:15:06.502 --> 00:15:08.602
knocks out all your spell
and trap cards!

00:15:10.202 --> 00:15:11.836
Curses!

00:15:11.836 --> 00:15:13.669
But when my Mage's Fortress
is destroyed,

00:15:13.669 --> 00:15:15.169
I get to draw one card.

00:15:17.502 --> 00:15:19.269
Yeah?
Well, since Gong summoned

00:15:19.269 --> 00:15:22.169
a Superheavy Synchro monster,

00:15:22.169 --> 00:15:27.002
Gong can summon
Superheavy Samurai Soulclaw!

00:15:27.002 --> 00:15:29.902
Soulhorns' special
ability activates!

00:15:29.902 --> 00:15:33.736
Then I equip Soulclaw
on to Shutendoji!

00:15:40.069 --> 00:15:43.136
Then Soulclaw's
special ability activates!

00:15:43.136 --> 00:15:45.569
Giving my Ogre
a helping hand by boosting

00:15:45.569 --> 00:15:48.702
its attack and defense
points by 500!

00:15:48.702 --> 00:15:50.936
And Gong's Ogre can use
its defense points

00:15:50.936 --> 00:15:53.269
to attack while
it's in defense mode!

00:15:53.269 --> 00:15:56.202
So my Ogre's gonna blow
Wind Drainer away!

00:15:58.336 --> 00:15:59.402
(yelping)

00:16:02.436 --> 00:16:04.502
Gong's got more where
that came from!

00:16:04.502 --> 00:16:08.069
Thanks t' Superheavy Soulhorns,
my Ogre can attack a second time

00:16:08.069 --> 00:16:10.969
when there's no traps or spells
in Gong's graveyard.

00:16:10.969 --> 00:16:14.336
This time, it's got you
in its sights McField!

00:16:14.336 --> 00:16:15.202
(screaming)

00:16:16.569 --> 00:16:18.702
(Melissa Trail)
Pa‐how‐‐ Pull out
the maple syrup,

00:16:18.702 --> 00:16:21.836
'cause Super Gong just
flap‐jacked that varmint!

00:16:21.836 --> 00:16:24.736
You may have hindered my plans,
Super Gong...

00:16:24.736 --> 00:16:25.936
But I shall prevail!

00:16:28.069 --> 00:16:30.636
I'll put my notorious
Pendulum Scale into motion

00:16:30.636 --> 00:16:32.569
using two of my hench‐monsters,

00:16:32.569 --> 00:16:37.002
Performage Mirror Conductor
and Performage Fire Dancer!

00:16:37.002 --> 00:16:39.236
I can summon a slew
of menacing monsters

00:16:39.236 --> 00:16:43.702
between Levels 4
and 5 simultaneously!

00:16:43.702 --> 00:16:48.136
Now, behold the savage power
of my Pendulum Summon!

00:16:48.136 --> 00:16:50.869
I call upon
Performage Plushfire...

00:16:50.869 --> 00:16:52.102
And Wind Drainer!

00:16:54.969 --> 00:16:56.836
What in the world is
a Pendulum Summon?

00:16:56.836 --> 00:16:59.436
I thought I was here
reporting on a magic show‐‐

00:16:59.436 --> 00:17:00.869
<i>but the tricks on me!</i>

00:17:00.869 --> 00:17:03.602
I can't believe we just saw a
brand new summoning method

00:17:03.602 --> 00:17:05.069
<i>called Penudulum!</i>

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.869
It has happened again.

00:17:06.869 --> 00:17:10.369
This is a real‐life battle...
So Pendulum Summoning can
also bring back monsters

00:17:10.369 --> 00:17:12.236
that were destroyed.

00:17:12.236 --> 00:17:15.069
Interesting‐‐ I'm learning more
and more.

00:17:16.436 --> 00:17:19.602
It appears I need to learn
a few new moves myself.

00:17:19.602 --> 00:17:22.536
Super Gong... when you lose
I'm gonna take your deck

00:17:22.536 --> 00:17:24.602
and put it
right where it belongs...

00:17:24.602 --> 00:17:26.502
and that's in the trash!

00:17:26.502 --> 00:17:28.469
Boo you!
You're mean!

00:17:28.469 --> 00:17:31.069
Of course I'm mean,
I'm the bad guy!

00:17:31.069 --> 00:17:33.869
And bad guys do
whatever it takes to win!

00:17:33.869 --> 00:17:36.236
Wind Drainer will use
its special ability

00:17:36.236 --> 00:17:39.036
to drain its own level!

00:17:39.036 --> 00:17:41.969
Since my monster minions
are now the same Level,

00:17:41.969 --> 00:17:43.569
I can build...

00:17:43.569 --> 00:17:46.936
the Overlay Network!

00:17:46.936 --> 00:17:48.436
Now for my next trick,

00:17:48.436 --> 00:17:52.069
here's a summon you probably
have never seen before!

00:17:54.136 --> 00:17:56.036
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:56.036 --> 00:17:57.136
(chuckling)

00:17:57.136 --> 00:17:59.136
Prepare to face
the acrobatic atrocities

00:17:59.136 --> 00:18:03.136
of my Rank 4 Performapal
Trapeze Magician!

00:18:03.136 --> 00:18:04.602
Sweetness!

00:18:17.211 --> 00:18:19.011
I Xyz Summon!

00:18:19.011 --> 00:18:20.011
(chuckling)

00:18:20.011 --> 00:18:22.278
Prepare to face
the acrobatic atrocities

00:18:22.278 --> 00:18:25.878
of my Rank 4
Performapal Trapeze Magician!

00:18:25.878 --> 00:18:26.878
A Rank?

00:18:26.878 --> 00:18:28.178
What is a Rank?

00:18:28.178 --> 00:18:29.844
Don't ask me how,
but Dennis just pulled

00:18:29.844 --> 00:18:32.511
a ten‐gallon surprise out of
a two‐gallon hat!

00:18:32.511 --> 00:18:34.878
He rounded up another
summoning method called Xyz

00:18:34.878 --> 00:18:37.578
<i>that I've never heard of!</i>

00:18:37.578 --> 00:18:40.744
I activate Mirror Conductor's
Pendulum Ability!

00:18:40.744 --> 00:18:43.178
Your Shutendoji's attack
and defense points become

00:18:43.178 --> 00:18:46.778
the same amount, except it'll be
the lower of the two.

00:18:46.778 --> 00:18:48.911
So since your monster has
1000 attack points,

00:18:48.911 --> 00:18:51.778
its defense points
also fall to 1000!

00:18:51.778 --> 00:18:54.078
Ha! How do you like that,
Super Gong!?

00:18:54.078 --> 00:18:57.611
Gong don't!
Plus, I'll activate Fire
Dancer's special ability,

00:18:57.611 --> 00:18:59.944
which lets Trapeze Magician
deal damage even if

00:18:59.944 --> 00:19:02.278
it attacks a monster
in defense mode!

00:19:02.278 --> 00:19:05.144
I activate Trapeze Magician's,
special ability!

00:19:05.144 --> 00:19:06.878
By using one of its
Overlay Units it can

00:19:06.878 --> 00:19:10.778
attack you twice
in a single turn!

00:19:10.778 --> 00:19:13.311
Now sway this way
and do my bidding!

00:19:13.311 --> 00:19:15.178
Take down that Ogre!

00:19:18.211 --> 00:19:19.511
Thanks to Gong's Soulclaw,

00:19:19.511 --> 00:19:22.144
it stops Gong's Ogre
from being destroyed.

00:19:22.144 --> 00:19:23.844
Yeah, but you still
take damage,

00:19:23.844 --> 00:19:26.211
thanks to Fire Dancer's
special ability!

00:19:26.211 --> 00:19:28.478
(cringing)

00:19:28.478 --> 00:19:32.044
Save yourself from further
humiliation and surrender now.

00:19:32.044 --> 00:19:32.944
Gong don't think so.

00:19:34.144 --> 00:19:38.044
Then ready yourself for
a second dose of damage!

00:19:38.044 --> 00:19:40.411
Trapeze Magician,
take another swinging swat

00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:42.911
at Superheavy Samurai
Ogre Shutendoji!

00:19:44.144 --> 00:19:45.944
(grunting)

00:19:45.944 --> 00:19:47.511
(laughing)

00:19:47.511 --> 00:19:48.844
You must enjoy
taking damage,

00:19:48.844 --> 00:19:50.544
because you're
very good at it!

00:19:50.544 --> 00:19:51.611
Boo!

00:19:51.611 --> 00:19:53.944
Stop 'im, Super Gong!
Yeah, fight back!

00:19:53.944 --> 00:19:55.044
(chuckling)

00:19:55.044 --> 00:19:56.678
Resistance is futile!

00:19:56.678 --> 00:19:58.878
(Melissa Trail)
Super Gong took a mighty big
whuppin' that round,

00:19:58.878 --> 00:20:00.311
<i>but he's still standin'!</i>

00:20:00.311 --> 00:20:02.144
That feller's quick on
the drawan' looks like

00:20:02.144 --> 00:20:03.711
he's still got
plenty o' fight!

00:20:03.711 --> 00:20:06.544
You may think this duel
is a goof, Dennis,

00:20:06.544 --> 00:20:08.411
but I'm serious!

00:20:08.411 --> 00:20:12.211
(grunting)

00:20:12.211 --> 00:20:14.344
Gong ain't
goin' down that easy.

00:20:14.344 --> 00:20:15.878
I unequip Soulhorns

00:20:15.878 --> 00:20:18.911
to summon it on my field
in defense mode.

00:20:18.911 --> 00:20:21.311
Like that move's
supposed to scare me!

00:20:21.311 --> 00:20:22.944
I activate Mirror Conductor's

00:20:22.944 --> 00:20:24.944
Pendulum ability
once again!

00:20:24.944 --> 00:20:27.078
Since Soulhorns
has 0 attack points,

00:20:27.078 --> 00:20:29.844
its defense points
become 0 as well!

00:20:29.844 --> 00:20:31.844
Gong also unequips Soulclaw

00:20:31.844 --> 00:20:34.911
to summon it
in defense mode!

00:20:34.911 --> 00:20:36.711
Now Gong's got three
Superheavy Samurais

00:20:36.711 --> 00:20:38.144
on Gong's field.

00:20:38.144 --> 00:20:41.244
Well, since Soulclaw's attack
and defense points are the same,

00:20:41.244 --> 00:20:43.311
Mirror Conductor's
ability won't work,

00:20:43.311 --> 00:20:45.078
but I'm not worried.

00:20:45.078 --> 00:20:47.678
Since I unequipped Soulclaw,
Superheavy Samurai

00:20:47.678 --> 00:20:51.878
Ogre Shutendoji's defense points
drop by 500.

00:20:51.878 --> 00:20:54.644
I summon...
the Tuner Monster,

00:20:54.644 --> 00:20:57.678
Superheavy Samurai Drum!

00:20:57.678 --> 00:21:02.044
My Superheavy Samurai Drum
tunes Superheavy Samurai Ogre

00:21:02.044 --> 00:21:05.844
Shutendoji, Soulclaw
and Soulhorns!

00:21:07.078 --> 00:21:08.844
By tuning
these four Samurais,

00:21:08.844 --> 00:21:12.011
Gong'll create a super samurai
to add to Gong's team!

00:21:14.844 --> 00:21:17.578
Gong Synchro Summons!

00:21:17.578 --> 00:21:21.811
Superheavy Samurai Warlord
Susanowo is gonna serve you up

00:21:21.811 --> 00:21:25.611
a heapin' helpin'
of just desserts!

00:21:25.611 --> 00:21:27.478
Thanks anyway,
but villains need

00:21:27.478 --> 00:21:29.744
to watch their waist,
Super Gong!

00:21:29.744 --> 00:21:32.378
Mirror Conductor drops your
Susanowo's defense points

00:21:32.378 --> 00:21:33.811
to 2400!

00:21:33.811 --> 00:21:36.978
You messed with me, now I'm
gonna mess with you!

00:21:36.978 --> 00:21:40.811
Susanowo let's Gong pay
500 life points to use a spell

00:21:40.811 --> 00:21:43.611
in your graveyard!

00:21:43.611 --> 00:21:46.744
Now Gong'll activate
Performance Mage Hurricane

00:21:46.744 --> 00:21:50.544
which blows your Pendulum
monsters back to your hand.

00:21:50.544 --> 00:21:52.711
Now that
Mirror Conductor's gone,

00:21:52.711 --> 00:21:56.111
Susanowo's defense points
return t' normal.

00:21:56.111 --> 00:21:59.711
Susanowo can attack
while in defense mode!

00:21:59.711 --> 00:22:03.311
Susanowo take out
Trapeze Magician!

00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:04.778
Swinging Sword Strike!

00:22:08.844 --> 00:22:11.044
Curse you, Super Gong!

00:22:11.044 --> 00:22:13.878
He did it!
Woo! Perty impressive!

00:22:13.878 --> 00:22:16.178
Thanks t' Super Gong,
peace has been restored

00:22:16.178 --> 00:22:17.378
<i>to our fair city!</i>

00:22:17.378 --> 00:22:20.844
This is Melissa Trail
signin' off!

00:22:20.844 --> 00:22:22.078
We're a smash hit!

00:22:22.078 --> 00:22:24.611
You said Yuya would watch
the show and find us,

00:22:24.611 --> 00:22:27.011
but there's no Yuya around,
you liar.

00:22:27.011 --> 00:22:28.978
You just used me
to make a buck.

00:22:28.978 --> 00:22:30.778
You really are
a super villain.

00:22:30.778 --> 00:22:33.311
Relax, Gong‐ster!
It's only a matter of‐‐

00:22:33.311 --> 00:22:36.344
(man #3)
That was sweet!

00:22:36.344 --> 00:22:40.711
If talent were a crime, you'd be
at the Facility doing time.

00:22:40.711 --> 00:22:43.044
Thanks.
I guess?

00:22:43.044 --> 00:22:46.878
I'm Lucas Swank, duel promoter,
extradaordinaire, mon frere!

00:22:46.878 --> 00:22:51.878
I turn duelists
like you into megastars!

00:22:51.878 --> 00:22:53.144
(grunting)

00:22:53.144 --> 00:22:55.644
Stick with me and soon fame
and fortune will be

00:22:55.644 --> 00:22:57.278
ours for the taking.
