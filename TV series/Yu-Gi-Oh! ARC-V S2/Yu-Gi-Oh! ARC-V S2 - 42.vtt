WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.800
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:08.866
Riley!

00:00:08.866 --> 00:00:10.600
Huh?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.533
I see the Professor still has
you on his leash... Barret.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:18.333
Step aside.
You'll have to make me!

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:19.833
(both)
Let's duel!

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:23.133
(Moon Shadow)
Heads up!

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:24.066
Huh?
Huh?

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.033
Moon Shadow!

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:29.833
The word from above
is that Obelisk Force

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:30.866
just showed up here.

00:00:30.866 --> 00:00:32.033
It is true.

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:34.533
They are tracking down
Celina as we speak.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:37.066
She needs your help,
but you'll have to hurry.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:39.533
Right now, the only one
protecting her is Riley.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:40.933
I will cover you!

00:00:42.366 --> 00:00:43.433
I think it's a breakout!
What's that?

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.366
(guard)
Alert!
Riot in progress!

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.000
All available guards
report to Sorting Area C!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.166
This is not a drill!
Guys, this is the chance
we've been waiting for!

00:00:50.166 --> 00:00:51.566
It's time.

00:00:51.566 --> 00:00:54.033
Spread the word that we're going
ahead with the plan.

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:56.766
We broke into the vault and
now we're breaking out

00:00:56.766 --> 00:00:58.033
<i>our DuelDisks!</i>

00:00:58.033 --> 00:00:59.800
We captured the generator
room and cut power

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.300
to all the
security systems!

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.900
Listen up my
fellow Commons...

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.766
Our campaign against
the Topsiders has begun!

00:01:06.766 --> 00:01:08.700
<i>The underground is ours!</i>

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.900
We'll ride the conveyor
belts to the surface!

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.866
And take the future
into our own hands!

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:14.766
(man1)
Let's roll!
(man 2)
Power to the Commons!

00:01:14.766 --> 00:01:17.500
I build the Overlay Network
and Xyz Summon

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.133
Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon!

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.666
Attack‐‐!

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.200
Halt!
What?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.566
I activate... Beastborg
Medal Of The Crimson Chain!

00:01:27.566 --> 00:01:30.233
Your mighty Dragon
is now harmless!

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:31.900
I'm doomed!

(roaring)

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.333
(Yuya)
To unchain my monsters, I need
to destroy Barret's Beastborg.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.366
But I can't destroy his
Beastborg if my monsters

00:02:52.366 --> 00:02:53.933
are chained up!

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:55.366
What a mess!

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.600
Go!

00:03:02.266 --> 00:03:03.900
(Yuya groaning)

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.133
I didn't want you feeling that
you were left out, so I've put

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:09.966
you under lock and key
just like your dragons.

00:03:09.966 --> 00:03:13.033
My Crimson Chain not only
prevents you from activating

00:03:13.033 --> 00:03:14.400
spells and traps...

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.800
But you are no longer allowed
to summon monsters as well!

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.233
I can't play anything?

00:03:21.233 --> 00:03:22.300
This stinks.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.833
Big time.

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:26.366
You've dueled enough times
to know when a comeback

00:03:26.366 --> 00:03:27.600
is impossible.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.333
So save me the time
and the trouble

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:31.966
and hand Celina
over to me.
Never!

00:03:31.966 --> 00:03:33.833
As a soldier
I can respect

00:03:33.833 --> 00:03:35.500
standing up
for a comrade

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.966
but it's better if she comes
with me willingly.

00:03:37.966 --> 00:03:39.466
Why's that?

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:42.966
Because if Obelisk Force
captures her instead of me

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:45.733
there's no telling what they
will do to her, what levels

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:49.300
of discipline they will dish out
on a traitor.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.600
But I can protect her from
the harshest of punishments.

00:03:55.366 --> 00:03:56.766
Listen Yuya,

00:03:56.766 --> 00:03:59.700
though Celina and I may fight
on different sides now,

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.700
I haven't forgotten the years
we spent together side‐by‐side,

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.266
battling for the same cause.

00:04:05.266 --> 00:04:07.533
So let's just end this now.

00:04:07.533 --> 00:04:09.633
I swear that
I will help her.

00:04:09.633 --> 00:04:12.300
No one cares more
for her than I do.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.666
This is for the best.

00:04:15.666 --> 00:04:17.400
Your best isn't good enough!

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.566
What was that?

00:04:19.566 --> 00:04:21.400
You heard what I said.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.633
I won't let you
take Celina!

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:27.500
Not now, not ever!

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:28.800
Is that so?

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.533
How do you intend to stop me
when you and your monsters

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:32.733
are all in chains?

00:04:32.733 --> 00:04:36.500
It's not gonna be easy,
but I'll find a way somehow.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:39.200
No matter what it takes,
Barrett, I'm gonna protect

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.866
Celina from your
whole dimension!

00:04:41.866 --> 00:04:44.400
(weak voice)
Yuya...

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.466
Tough talk is cheap.

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:50.966
When your side loses ‐‐ and your
side will lose very badly ‐‐

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:54.066
let's see if you'll
be singing a different tune.

00:04:54.066 --> 00:04:55.066
Bring it!

00:04:55.066 --> 00:04:57.366
I'm not afraid!

00:04:57.366 --> 00:04:59.266
You will be!

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:07.266
You toughed out
my first barrage,

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:10.233
but now I'm calling in
the heavy armor.

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:12.866
Roll in, Carrier Sentinel!

00:05:14.766 --> 00:05:18.266
Carrier Sentinel also brings me
additional backup by letting me

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:22.100
draw a monster
from my deck for support.

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:25.900
This Pitch‐Black Warwolf will
prove essential in executing

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.200
my battle plans when I activate
Beastborg Fusioner!

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:33.833
This spell card allows me to
fuse Pitch‐Black Warwolf with

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.466
Carrier Sentinel to summon
a new Beastborg!

00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:41.433
A Beastborg that rules the
battlefield with shock and awe!

00:05:44.166 --> 00:05:45.900
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.966
Advance to the front lines,
Beastborg Wolf Kampfer!

00:05:52.066 --> 00:05:55.400
If you couldn't handle one
Beastborg what can you do

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:57.166
against two, Yuya?

00:05:57.166 --> 00:06:00.866
Especially when Panther Predator
has set its eye on you!

00:06:00.866 --> 00:06:04.733
My ferocious feline will inflict
damage equal to half of its

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:06.766
attack points this turn.

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:09.800
(roaring)

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:14.533
Fire your Quasar Beam and deal
800 points of damage!

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:21.833
There's more.

00:06:21.833 --> 00:06:25.933
My trap Beastborg Medal
of the Steel Chain activates!

00:06:25.933 --> 00:06:29.133
All your monsters lose attack
points equal to the damage

00:06:29.133 --> 00:06:33.100
you took, so both your Dragons
grow weaker by 800!

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:40.533
Just hang in there!

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:43.600
I promise I'll free you!

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.700
Yeah, right.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.100
Don't make promises
that you can't keep.

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:48.400
You can't win this duel.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:49.733
You can't
save Celina.

00:06:49.733 --> 00:06:51.200
You can't do a thing!

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.800
What's it gonna take
to get through to you?

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.200
Much more than what you're
dishing out!

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.533
It's not over!

00:06:57.533 --> 00:07:00.200
I've gotten out of much tougher
jams than this!

00:07:07.900 --> 00:07:09.766
(whimpering)

00:07:16.666 --> 00:07:18.300
Go away!

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.933
I won't let you take Celina!

00:07:30.300 --> 00:07:33.566
♪

00:07:33.566 --> 00:07:35.333
(gasps)

00:07:39.433 --> 00:07:40.733
(gasps)

00:07:40.733 --> 00:07:43.333
(whimpering)

00:07:43.333 --> 00:07:46.266
(scared moaning)

00:07:50.166 --> 00:07:51.500
Riley...

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:53.633
I'm the one you have
to fight, not Riley!

00:07:53.633 --> 00:07:56.366
You can't fight anyone.

00:07:56.366 --> 00:07:58.433
(Riley)
Celina needs my help...

00:07:58.433 --> 00:08:01.633
If I don't keep them away,
they'll take her...

00:08:01.633 --> 00:08:03.533
I gotta fight back.

00:08:03.533 --> 00:08:05.600
I gotta stop em'!

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:07.933
If you've got the stuff, kid.

00:08:07.933 --> 00:08:10.000
Then don't be afraid
to use it.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.233
'cause when you do,

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.800
there won't be anybody who'll be
able to stop you.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.033
I won't let you take Celina.

00:08:16.033 --> 00:08:18.833
But if you're not going to stop,
you're leaving me no choice

00:08:18.833 --> 00:08:20.700
but to stop you myself.

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:24.900
I promise to stand up
and fight...

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.500
And when Celina needed my help,
I was there for her!

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:35.066
Three against one,
but I...

00:08:35.066 --> 00:08:37.533
defeated them.

00:08:37.533 --> 00:08:39.600
And I can do it again!

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.633
(weak voice)
Riley... no...

00:08:41.633 --> 00:08:44.633
You've... done... enough...

00:08:44.633 --> 00:08:45.700
(groans)

00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:46.900
(gasps)

00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:48.266
Run Riley...

00:08:48.266 --> 00:08:49.300
It's fine.

00:08:49.300 --> 00:08:51.133
I'm feeling better...

00:08:51.133 --> 00:08:53.866
I can fight them
all by... myself.

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.100
Celina!

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:56.100
No!

out of your Dragons!

00:14:29.166 --> 00:14:32.833
And since I dealt you damage,
Wolf Kampfer's special ability

00:14:32.833 --> 00:14:36.066
orders up a tactical strike
that blasts away 300

of your life points!

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.133

out of your Dragons!

you know how dangerous

00:18:27.666 --> 00:18:29.700
Sector Security
patrols can be.

00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:31.600
Obelisk Force
may be even worse

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:34.333
and they're
hunting down Celina.

00:18:34.333 --> 00:18:37.133
Yuya's trying to stop them
but it may not be enough.

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:41.433
I'll do everything I can to help
him send Obelisk Force packing!

00:18:41.433 --> 00:18:43.166
I'll be dueling
beside you.

Well, guys?
Where should we start lookin'?

We do need to find Zuzu, but
Riley may also need our help.

00:19:04.566 --> 00:19:06.266
Remember, Riley's
defending Celina

00:19:06.266 --> 00:19:08.033
from Obelisk Force
all alone.

00:19:08.033 --> 00:19:09.433

If we head that way, we can back
him up and scout for Zuzu!

I bet once Yuya heard that
Obelisk Force was here,

00:19:23.266 --> 00:19:25.333
he went to help
Celina, as well.

00:19:25.333 --> 00:19:28.200
If we head in Riley's direction
and luck is on our side,

all of our friends.

I'd help them search, but I must
return to Riley

Sir, we've picked up more
Obelisk troops in sector RT55.

That's where Celina is located
so they're probably

Could this bracelet
