00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.800
And when we
pull this off,

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.600
our Topsider "friends" are
gonna find out what it's
like

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.166
to be treated
as bottom dwellers!

thinks he's dueling

in the "Un‐friendship Cup!"

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.700
Look I understand
why you're angry, Shinji.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.200
But pitting Commons and
Topsiders against each other

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.033
isn't gonna fix anything!

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:06.833
If you really want to
change this world,

00:03:06.833 --> 00:03:08.333
then you've gotta
bring 'em together,

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:09.500
not tear 'em apart.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.700
Oh, please, that's easy
for you to say.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.900
But you never had to survive

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.333
by eating
someone else's scraps

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:17.366
for breakfast,
lunch and dinner.

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:20.766
We're hungry, Yuya,
hungry for a rebellion!

00:03:20.766 --> 00:03:21.700
Aah.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.633
(Crow)
Man, I know Shinji and I

00:03:23.633 --> 00:03:25.366
have had it rough
all these years,

00:03:25.366 --> 00:03:26.766
but a rebellion?

00:03:26.766 --> 00:03:28.400
I don't know about that.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.466
But maybe that's the way
it's gotta be.

00:03:30.466 --> 00:03:32.466
Like back in the day,
when the whole City,

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:34.666
Topsiders and Commons alike,

00:03:34.666 --> 00:03:37.266
stood behind Jack
when he became champ,

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:38.700
I was stoked!

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.966
Imagine,
those hoity‐toity Topsiders

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:43.633
supporting a guy
who came from Commons!

00:03:43.633 --> 00:03:45.466
I hoped things
were gonna change!

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:46.866
But they didn't.

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:49.966
It's like Jack thinks
he's a Topsider himself.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.500
So I hate to say it,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.133
but maybe Shinji's way
is the right way...

00:03:54.133 --> 00:03:56.100
that we need a rebellion.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.233
But I don't know.

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:00.500
If we work together,
we can win!

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:01.866
Sure, some of you
might be thinking

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.900
that the rebellion
won't work.

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.833
You're thinking, "What can
one person do to cause
change?

00:04:06.833 --> 00:04:08.366
<i>It's hopeless."</i>

00:04:08.366 --> 00:04:09.466
<i>But I say you're wrong!</i>

00:04:09.466 --> 00:04:11.966
Little changes
can lead to big changes!

00:04:11.966 --> 00:04:16.133
No matter how small, like
my tiny Pin the Bullseye!

00:04:16.133 --> 00:04:17.500
Sure, it's
special ability

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.566
only deals a measly
200 points of damage,

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:24.800
but if I have three of them,
it deals a significant blow!

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.100
Unh!

I have to banish it!

send it to my Extra Deck.

Silver Claw

Yuya can't be serious!

He's playing that wimp again?

00:16:57.053 --> 00:16:59.153
Is he trying
to throw this duel?

Summoning Tuning Magician

will take me
right to the brink!

00:17:03.719 --> 00:17:06.219
You gain 400
life points, of course,

00:17:06.219 --> 00:17:09.286
while I'll lose
that exact same amount!

00:17:09.286 --> 00:17:12.053
Why would he make himself weaker
on purpose?

00:17:12.053 --> 00:17:13.786
Another genius move!

00:17:13.786 --> 00:17:16.419
You keep digging yourself
into deeper trouble!

00:17:16.419 --> 00:17:18.419
Thanks to you,
Hama is becoming

00:17:18.419 --> 00:17:22.419
stronger by the second!

00:17:22.419 --> 00:17:24.986
My grandma could've made
a better move than that.

Oh, dear,
we could lose everything.

00:17:27.753 --> 00:17:30.586
Tuning Magician may seem weak,

00:17:30.586 --> 00:17:33.753
but it can tune my monsters
with the best of 'em!

Welcome to the battlefield,
Enlightenment Paladin!

<i>Seems like Yuya</i>

00:17:53.019 --> 00:17:55.786
has a little life
in him after all!

00:17:55.786 --> 00:17:57.353
Huh?
That's great,

00:17:57.353 --> 00:17:59.719
but what in the world
took him so long?

00:17:59.719 --> 00:18:01.319
Huh?

00:18:01.319 --> 00:18:03.219
Amazing!

00:18:03.219 --> 00:18:05.686
He just went
from loser to bruiser!

00:18:05.686 --> 00:18:07.786
Congratulations, Yuya.

00:18:07.786 --> 00:18:09.086
That's one
of the coolest monsters

00:18:09.086 --> 00:18:10.586
I've seen in this tournament,

00:18:10.586 --> 00:18:12.919
but "cool" won't cut it
against Hama!

00:18:12.919 --> 00:18:16.619
Your Paladin's not
strong enough to stop it!

00:18:16.619 --> 00:18:18.553
(Yuya)
You're right.

00:18:18.553 --> 00:18:21.319
Paladin isn't
strong enough... yet!

00:18:21.319 --> 00:18:24.653
But watch what happens when
its special ability kicks in!

00:18:24.653 --> 00:18:27.353
Since I used Tuning Magician
to Synchro Summon,

00:18:27.353 --> 00:18:29.186
I can snag one spell
from the graveyard

00:18:29.186 --> 00:18:30.953

00:18:35.219 --> 00:18:36.919
Hold on! Hey!

00:18:36.919 --> 00:18:38.286
What's happening?

00:18:38.286 --> 00:18:42.186
I'm about to add the spell card
Gap Power to my hand!

00:18:44.953 --> 00:18:46.653
Here we go!

00:18:46.653 --> 00:18:49.186
I'm raising
Paladin's attack points

00:18:49.186 --> 00:18:51.019
by increasing them
by half the difference

00:18:51.019 --> 00:18:52.486
in our life points!

00:18:52.486 --> 00:18:55.919
It's easy math and adds up
to trouble for you!

00:18:55.919 --> 00:18:58.119
I can see the finish line,
Shinji,

00:18:58.119 --> 00:19:02.886

rearview mirror!

It's more powerful
than Hama now!

00:19:05.386 --> 00:19:06.953
I thought
Timebreaker was worthless.

00:19:06.953 --> 00:19:08.719
I can't believe
he pulled it off!

00:19:08.719 --> 00:19:14.086
(Sam)
I never would have thought to
use Tuning Magician that way!

00:19:14.086 --> 00:19:15.519
Shinji, I hope you learned

00:19:15.519 --> 00:19:17.819
