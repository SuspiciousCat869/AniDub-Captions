00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:04.433
(Melissa)
Hey‐howdy‐hey,
duel fans!

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:05.566
<i>Hope you're ready!</i>

00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:07.333
Oh, I am!

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:11.100
Because we are about to begin
the second day of dueling

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.533
<i>in the Friendship Cup!</i>

00:00:12.533 --> 00:00:15.500
And to kick things off,
it'll be Officer 227

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.900
of the Duel Chaser Division
versus Yuya Sakaki!

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.233
So hold onto your hats,
'causethis is sure to be a good
one!

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.366
Yuya!

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.333
Yuya...

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.533
Yuya?

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:37.666
Why does he get
to duel before I do?

00:00:37.666 --> 00:00:38.933
Oh wait, I know...

00:00:38.933 --> 00:00:40.133
Best looking
goes last.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:45.566
(knocking)

00:00:45.566 --> 00:00:48.466
(beeping)

00:00:48.466 --> 00:00:50.266
You're up next...

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.300
You can follow
me, Yuya...

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.700
Sam, the card
that you gave me.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.166
You want me to win so that I can
give this card back to Jack.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:05.733
Mmm‐hmm.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.733
But if I win, that means
the person I'm dueling loses.

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.033
And that means it's on me

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:14.866
for sending them to that
underground garbage dump.

00:01:14.866 --> 00:01:16.800
And that's all sorts
of wrong...

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.066
Someone has to
put a stop to this.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:22.133
So wish me luck, 'cause the one
who's gonna stop it is me!

And here he comes, duel
buckaroos and buckarettes!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.866
The Duel Chaser who is so
by‐the‐book he goes by a
number,

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:36.400
<i>227!</i>

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.000
But many thought his number
was up after a hot pursuit

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.100
<i>went cold on National TV!</i>

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.666
Let's see if he
can cuff the competition!

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:46.666
Please, he couldn't
even catch a cold.

00:02:46.666 --> 00:02:50.233
<i>Give it up for 227!</i>

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:52.833
♪

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:57.500
It's all up to
you now, 227.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.100
Win and your
old job is yours.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.333
Lose and it's to
the underground.

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:06.133
And now, introducing
Yuya Sakaki!

00:03:06.133 --> 00:03:07.433
(woman)
You stink!

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:09.700
(boy)
Jack beat you like
you were nothing!

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.533
(boy)
It's the master
of disaster!

00:03:11.533 --> 00:03:13.333
(man)
Hope you don't
duel like last time.

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:14.866
(man)
Yuya?
More like boo‐ya!

00:03:14.866 --> 00:03:17.066
This crowd is so not
showing the love!

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.466
Of course not.

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:21.700
You're serving
them meatloaf

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.933
when what they
want is filet mignon!

00:03:23.933 --> 00:03:25.200
Yuya...

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.633
Never mind the crowd,
I'm still rooting for you.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:37.566
<i>Yeehaw!</i>

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:39.666
We're about to put the pedal
to the medal

00:03:39.666 --> 00:03:41.866
and tear up
this ol' track!

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:42.866
(Yuya)
Wait!

00:03:42.866 --> 00:03:43.866
<i>What?</i>

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:44.766
Listen...

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:46.933
You all need to
know something!

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:50.733
This Friendship Cup
is not about Friendship!

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:54.100
When a duelist loses, they're
sent away to the underground

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.500
where they're forced
into hard labor!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.933
Huh?

00:03:57.933 --> 00:03:59.700
What?

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.000
And once they're there,
they stay there,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.833
cleaning up trash
against their will

00:04:03.833 --> 00:04:05.700
for the rest of
their lives!

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:06.866
So then...

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:07.866
Oh, no!

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:08.866
Everyone who's lost,

00:04:08.866 --> 00:04:10.200
Gong, Chojiro,

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.733
they're all prisoners?

00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:14.133
You see, they'vetricked
us and you!

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:15.700
If Yuya is right...

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:16.766
Then...

00:04:16.766 --> 00:04:17.800
Then what?

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.433
This doesn't
change a single thing.

00:04:19.433 --> 00:04:20.700
Yes.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.333
You see, it is only right that
there are consequences

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:26.200
for those duelists
who lose their matches.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.933
(White)
High stakes create high drama,
and clearly this crowd agrees.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.300
(cheering and chatter)

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.033
(gasps)

00:04:39.033 --> 00:04:41.066
So naive.

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:42.900
(sighing)

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.533
You ain't from
here are you?

00:04:45.533 --> 00:04:47.800
This is life
in the big city!

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.700
<i>Am I right y'all?</i>

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:51.900
(cheering)

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.866
You mean you're
all okay with this?

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:54.933
You bet!

00:04:54.933 --> 00:04:55.933
Now, what do
you say?

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:57.100
Let's duel!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.766
It's time to fire up the
Action Field Crossover...

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:02.233
Acceleration!

00:05:04.166 --> 00:05:06.666
Wait... this doesn't
make any sense.

00:05:06.666 --> 00:05:08.600
(computer)
<i>Duel Mode engaged!</i>

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.800
<i>Autopilot activated...</i>

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:15.733
<i>Now, on your mark...</i>

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:16.966
<i>Get set...</i>

00:05:16.966 --> 00:05:19.100
<i>And...</i>

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.100
<i>go!</i>

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.200
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:05:27.966 --> 00:05:31.000
And since 227 has
rounded the corner first

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.533
<i>he gets to go first!</i>

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:35.400
Punishing duelists
is wrong!

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.333
It goes against everything
dueling stands for!

00:05:38.333 --> 00:05:40.500
Sounds like you're just
worried you're gonna lose

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.033
and get what's
coming to you!

00:05:42.033 --> 00:05:43.266
Yeah, he's chicken.

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:45.533
That's probably why
he lost to Jack Atlas!

00:05:45.533 --> 00:05:46.900
I'm not afraid.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.133
I'm standing up for my friends
and you need to listen!

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:52.033
Quit wasting
your breath...

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:54.666
This city only listen
to winners.

00:05:54.666 --> 00:05:58.300
They won't turn an ear
until you prove you can win.

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.066
So put up or shut up!

00:06:01.066 --> 00:06:04.000
Dueling is about
spreading joy, not fear!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.833
(227)
Enough talk!

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:08.700
You and I are here to duel
not to make speeches!

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.833
So get yourself ready...

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.966
'Cause the long arm of
the law is coming for you!

00:06:16.733 --> 00:06:19.433
(cheering)

00:06:19.433 --> 00:06:21.100
It's my turn!

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.733
And for my first move,
I'm summoning...

00:06:23.733 --> 00:06:24.733
Jutte Lord!

00:06:27.333 --> 00:06:29.166
Thanks to its
special ability,

00:06:29.166 --> 00:06:32.166
I can summon another
Jutte monster!

00:06:32.166 --> 00:06:33.866
Come Jutte Fighter!

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:38.233
Level 2 Jutte Fighter...

00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:40.366
Tunes Level 4
Jutte Lord!

00:06:42.833 --> 00:06:45.366
To catch my prey...
I call a predator.

00:06:48.266 --> 00:06:49.900
I Synchro Summon!

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:51.966
Level 6 Goyo Predator!

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:55.300
But I'm not
done yet...

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:56.600
Because now...

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.233
I activate
the equip spell...

00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:00.333
Goyo Arrow!

00:07:00.333 --> 00:07:03.100
And who better to partner it up
with than Goyo Predator!

00:07:06.833 --> 00:07:09.733
And this weapon's
locked and loaded!

00:07:09.733 --> 00:07:11.466
So my Predator
deals damage...

00:07:11.466 --> 00:07:14.300
Equal to a hundred times
its own level!

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:16.233
Predator's
level is six...

00:07:16.233 --> 00:07:18.533
So you're gonna
be taking...

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:19.800
600 points
of damage!

00:07:24.366 --> 00:07:26.100
I end my turn!

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.433
Yee‐ha!

00:07:27.433 --> 00:07:28.800
This duel only
just started,

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.533
but this
copper's in hot pursuit

00:07:30.533 --> 00:07:32.500
and already chased down
a heaping helping

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.400
of Yuya's life points!

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:37.100
Now time to
see your moves...

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.966
Or are you just going to bore
us all with more talk?

00:07:40.966 --> 00:07:44.733
(Yuya)
Fine, I guess my dueltaining
will have to change their minds.

00:07:44.733 --> 00:07:45.733
All right then...

00:07:45.733 --> 00:07:46.700
It's showtime!

00:07:48.633 --> 00:07:49.900
I set the Pendulum Scale

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.833
with Scale 3 Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Light Phoenix...

00:07:53.833 --> 00:07:57.866
and my Scale 8 Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn!

00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:01.533
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:10.133
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:08:10.133 --> 00:08:11.666
all at the same time!

00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:15.733
But I know you're
sick of all my talking,

00:08:15.733 --> 00:08:17.333
so don't take my
word for it...

00:08:17.333 --> 00:08:19.333
See for yourself!

00:08:19.333 --> 00:08:21.500
My monsters
are ready...

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.500
to swing into action!

00:08:25.266 --> 00:08:26.266
Seeing' is believin'

00:08:26.266 --> 00:08:28.866
Performapal
Bot‐Eyes Lizard!

00:08:28.866 --> 00:08:32.033
Light up the night
Performapal Fireflux!

00:08:32.033 --> 00:08:34.700
And now, ladies
and gentlemen...

00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.433
Grab your popcorn and
don't you dare blink

00:08:37.433 --> 00:08:40.633
because the real
show is starting now!

00:08:40.633 --> 00:08:42.033
Here we go!

00:08:42.033 --> 00:08:45.666
Bot‐Eyes Lizard
attack Goyo Predator!

00:08:45.666 --> 00:08:48.466
But that Predator
has 2,400 attack points

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:51.033
and Yuya's Lizard
only has 1,600!

00:08:51.033 --> 00:08:53.266
This may be
a short show!

00:08:53.266 --> 00:08:56.000
Next I activate Performapal
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn's

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.600
Pendulum ability!

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.066
It lets me add a
Performapal's attack points

00:09:00.066 --> 00:09:03.666
to an Odd‐Eyes
that's battling!

00:09:03.666 --> 00:09:05.333
What are you
talking about?

00:09:05.333 --> 00:09:08.233
Your Odd‐Eyes isn't even
the one attacking!

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:09.633
True!

00:09:09.633 --> 00:09:13.233
But that's all about to change
due to Bot‐Eyes' ability!

00:09:13.233 --> 00:09:16.100
My bow‐tied buddy can
take on a new identity

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:20.433
and the identity it chooses
is, the one, the only,

00:09:20.433 --> 00:09:23.900
the show stopping,
Odd‐Eyes Dragon!

00:09:26.466 --> 00:09:29.200
And now, Performapal
Fireflux power it up

00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.900
with those 1,200
attack points!

00:09:32.633 --> 00:09:35.233
Now Odd‐Eyes, finish
what Bot‐Eyes started!

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.533
<i>And just like that,</i>

00:09:38.533 --> 00:09:42.433
Goyo Arrow and Goyo Predator
are Goyo‐gone!

00:09:42.433 --> 00:09:43.900
Your turn now, Fireflux,

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:45.933
you helped with
Odd‐Eyes' attack...

00:09:45.933 --> 00:09:47.866
Now attack on
your own!

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:53.233
Well, folks, Yuya
promised to put on a show!

00:09:53.233 --> 00:09:56.566
And I'd say he certainly has
made good on that so far!

00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:58.066
Now that
the battle is over,

00:09:58.066 --> 00:10:00.933
the effect of Odd‐Eyes Unicorn's
ability is over, too...

00:10:02.700 --> 00:10:05.233
So I'll just go ahead
and end my turn.

00:10:05.233 --> 00:10:07.466
This kid is
doing rather well.

00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:08.733
Yes.

00:10:08.733 --> 00:10:11.266
But it's probably because
he's not facing Jack.

00:10:11.266 --> 00:10:12.633
Lucky move!

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:14.500
But luck has a
way of running out...

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.133
Whereas my skills as
a duelist don't!

00:10:17.133 --> 00:10:18.833
It's my turn!

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:21.600
I activate the spell
Monster Reborn!

00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600
And with it...

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:23.966
I'll bring back
Goyo Predator!

00:10:25.300 --> 00:10:27.533
Uh‐oh, the Predator
is back...

00:10:27.533 --> 00:10:31.033
Now the question is
who its prey will be!

00:10:31.033 --> 00:10:34.700
Go Goyo Predator, hunt down
Yuya's Bot‐Eyes Lizard!

00:10:37.933 --> 00:10:40.100
Hold your horses...
Yuya's making a move

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:42.433
before that Predator
can make its move!

00:10:42.433 --> 00:10:44.666
He's going for
an Action Card!

00:10:44.666 --> 00:10:46.366
Don't think so!

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.066
Hang in there!

00:10:56.066 --> 00:10:58.700
Yuya tried to pickpocket
that there Action Card

00:10:58.700 --> 00:11:00.900
but got
served some justice!

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:02.433
What a stopper from
the copper.

00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:11.066
This pursuit
isn't over yet...

00:11:11.066 --> 00:11:13.433
Your monster may have
been destroyed!

00:11:13.433 --> 00:11:15.833
But my Predator
can bring it back!

00:11:15.833 --> 00:11:16.833
Huh?

00:11:16.833 --> 00:11:20.066
That's right, consider
it commandeered!

00:11:20.066 --> 00:11:21.800
<i>Oh, my...</i>

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.800
Yuya's monster has flipped
andis fighting for the other
side!

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:29.566
Go Bot‐Eyes, do some damage
and light up that Fireflux!

00:11:33.666 --> 00:11:35.700
I'll end my
turn right there...

00:11:35.700 --> 00:11:37.266
<i>Sufferin' sarsaparillas!</i>

00:11:37.266 --> 00:11:41.100
Yuya's life points sure took
a walloping that round!

00:11:41.100 --> 00:11:43.933
I'm down... but
there's no way that I'm out!

00:11:43.933 --> 00:11:45.233
The show must
go on!

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.966
Once again, my
monsters are ready...

00:11:50.966 --> 00:11:52.933
To swing into
action!

00:11:54.733 --> 00:11:56.100
Welcome back, Fireflux!

00:11:58.433 --> 00:12:01.033
Good to see you again,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:10.800
Yuya may be lacking
in life points,

00:12:10.800 --> 00:12:13.366
but this move is
quite the show stopper!

00:12:13.366 --> 00:12:16.033
Due to Odd‐Eyes Unicorn's
special ability,

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:19.433
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon will
gain Fireflux's attack points,

00:12:19.433 --> 00:12:23.000
so when Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
uses its own special ability

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.333
and deals
double damage,

00:12:24.333 --> 00:12:27.866
Officer 227 will really
feel the burn!

00:12:27.866 --> 00:12:29.700
Yuya can with
this match right here!

00:12:31.900 --> 00:12:33.500
Blast him, Yuya!

00:12:33.500 --> 00:12:35.233
(man)
Take him down!

00:12:35.233 --> 00:12:37.300
It all comes down
to this...

00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:39.333
One attack
and it's over!

00:12:42.933 --> 00:12:44.666
(Melissa)
It all comes down
to this...

00:12:44.666 --> 00:12:46.766
One attack
and it's over!

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:49.866
(crowd chanting)
Do it! Do it!

00:12:49.866 --> 00:12:51.033
Finish him, Yuya!

00:12:51.033 --> 00:12:52.500
(man)
Throw the book
at him!

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.766
Send him
underground!

00:12:53.766 --> 00:12:55.466
(man)
That Copper don't
deserve to win!

00:12:55.466 --> 00:12:57.800
He's nothing but garbage!

00:12:57.800 --> 00:12:59.433
(cheering and jeering)

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:04.500
(Yuya)
If I attack,
I'll win...

00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:06.733
But that means I'll be sending
him to the underground

00:13:06.733 --> 00:13:09.600
for a life of hardship.

00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:11.733
You should've attacked
when you had the chance!

00:13:21.033 --> 00:13:23.500
Ha, and it's
all mine!

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:26.366
Well, hog‐tie a huckleberry
and fetch the sheriff!

00:13:26.366 --> 00:13:28.933
227 has snagged
an Action Card!

00:13:28.933 --> 00:13:30.700
Check this out!

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.533
I play Battle Lock!

00:13:32.533 --> 00:13:35.533
And you're no longer allowed
to attack this turn!

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.700
Your lock on the win
has been locked up!

00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.233
That's what Yuya
gets for hesitating.

00:13:47.366 --> 00:13:49.866
You call
this a show?

00:13:49.866 --> 00:13:51.266
I end my turn.

00:13:54.200 --> 00:13:56.033
When a duelist
loses the crowd,

00:13:56.033 --> 00:13:59.000
it's usually not long before
he loses the match...

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.800
Yuya...

00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:02.166
You punk kid!

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:04.100
It's time I teach
you the rule of law!

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:05.100
Get ready!

00:14:08.766 --> 00:14:11.166
I summon Stygian Security
from my hand!

00:14:13.866 --> 00:14:16.900
Then I'll tune Level 1
Stygian Security with your‐‐

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:21.733
I mean my Level 4
Bot‐Eyes!

00:14:21.733 --> 00:14:23.733
You may not respect the badge,
but you will learn

00:14:23.733 --> 00:14:27.166
to respect this mighty
and magnificent enforcer!

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:29.500
I Synchro Summon!

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.933
Goyo chaser,
front and center!

00:14:34.466 --> 00:14:35.766
But I'm not done...

00:14:35.766 --> 00:14:37.200
Oh, no...

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.633
As I said,
Yuya...

00:14:38.633 --> 00:14:41.100
You will now learn
the rule of law!

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.033
I activate the spell card
Polymerization!

00:14:44.033 --> 00:14:46.066
Polymerization!

00:14:46.066 --> 00:14:49.066
Yuya, this next card is a
gift from a certain someone...

00:14:49.066 --> 00:14:52.933
A someone who wants to make
sure you crash and burn!

00:14:52.933 --> 00:14:55.100
I Fusion Summon!

00:14:55.100 --> 00:14:58.100
Now, bow to the ultimate
authority figure!

00:14:58.100 --> 00:15:00.166
Bow down to
Goyo Emperor!

00:15:02.233 --> 00:15:03.966
I do not believe it!

00:15:03.966 --> 00:15:07.400
Since when did Officer 227
know how to Fusion Summon?

00:15:10.733 --> 00:15:13.400
That's some gift...

00:15:13.400 --> 00:15:15.933
I wonder who
gave him that card?

00:15:18.266 --> 00:15:19.533
All right...

00:15:19.533 --> 00:15:22.533
Goyo Emperor, slay Yuya's
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.566
Blazing Breath
Blast!

00:15:29.633 --> 00:15:32.466
(Melissa)
That some seriously
bad breath!

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:35.733
Goyo Emperor's
special ability activates!

00:15:35.733 --> 00:15:40.833
Pardoning the destruction of
your Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:40.833 --> 00:15:43.166
My, Yuya got lucky!

00:15:43.166 --> 00:15:44.400
Don't get
used to it.

00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:46.866
That monster's now under
my jurisdiction!

00:15:46.866 --> 00:15:47.800
(gasps)

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:53.000
How's that for laying
down the law, Yuya?

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:55.800
Now, maybe the next time you
think about crossing me,

00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:57.866
you'll think twice!

00:15:57.866 --> 00:16:00.266
Go, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon...

00:16:00.266 --> 00:16:01.700
Attack Fireflux!

00:16:06.766 --> 00:16:08.733
(groans)

00:16:08.733 --> 00:16:12.266
And Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
has a new special ability

00:16:12.266 --> 00:16:14.500
that I'm sure you're
quite familiar with.

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:16.433
Instead of
destroying Fireflux,

00:16:16.433 --> 00:16:18.666
I can now commandeer
that blazing bug!

00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:22.366
<i>Oh, my...</i>

00:16:22.366 --> 00:16:25.200
Yuya's two monsters have
turned against him!

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:26.933
(man)
One more attack
and he's through!

00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:28.300
(man)
This duel's over!

00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.600
(man)
Finish him, 227!

00:16:32.066 --> 00:16:34.900
Prepare to be
processed, Yuya!

00:16:39.154 --> 00:16:41.088
Prepare to be
processed, Yuya!

00:16:43.454 --> 00:16:47.188
If losing is part of your
shtick, you need new material.

00:16:47.188 --> 00:16:48.588
Yuya...

00:16:48.588 --> 00:16:51.654
That's right, you all know that
if you mess around with the law,

00:16:51.654 --> 00:16:53.788
the law doesn't
mess around!

00:16:55.154 --> 00:16:57.388
♪

00:17:00.888 --> 00:17:04.321
Go, Fireflux
attack Yuya directly!

00:17:04.321 --> 00:17:06.688
It's time to close
the case on this duel!

00:17:08.921 --> 00:17:11.588
Light Phoenix's Pendulum
ability activates!

00:17:11.588 --> 00:17:13.321
When you attack
me directly...

00:17:13.321 --> 00:17:15.254
I can destroy
Odd‐Eyes Unicorn

00:17:15.254 --> 00:17:18.321
to summon Odd‐Eyes Light
Phoenix by my side!

00:17:18.321 --> 00:17:21.654
(Melissa)
And just like that Yuya has
whipped out a monster

00:17:21.654 --> 00:17:23.988
that's stronger
than Fireflux!

00:17:23.988 --> 00:17:26.021
Looks like our copper's
gonna have to let Yuya

00:17:26.021 --> 00:17:28.988
<i>walk away a free man!</i>

00:17:28.988 --> 00:17:30.621
A last minute pardon...

00:17:30.621 --> 00:17:31.888
I end my turn!

00:17:31.888 --> 00:17:34.888
So Yuya gets one more
chance to turn things around...

00:17:34.888 --> 00:17:38.421
And turn around this crowd
that seems to despise him...

00:17:38.421 --> 00:17:39.554
<i>Can he do it?</i>

00:17:39.554 --> 00:17:40.821
We're about to
find out!

00:17:44.654 --> 00:17:47.454
Time to watch
a rising star!

00:17:47.454 --> 00:17:48.788
(laughs)

00:17:52.121 --> 00:17:55.188
I activate the spell:
Double Reborn Level 4!

00:17:56.721 --> 00:17:59.921
We both bring back one Level 4
monster from our graveyards

00:17:59.921 --> 00:18:01.921
and place them
in defense mode!

00:18:01.921 --> 00:18:03.254
What are you up to?

00:18:03.254 --> 00:18:04.854
You'll see!

00:18:04.854 --> 00:18:06.954
Fine then, if I have
to, I'll bring back...

00:18:06.954 --> 00:18:09.621
Level 4 Jutte Lord!

00:18:11.721 --> 00:18:15.554
And I'll revive my Level 4
Performapal Bot‐Eyes Lizard!

00:18:17.021 --> 00:18:19.021
Thanks to Bot‐Eyes's
special ability...

00:18:19.021 --> 00:18:21.354
I'll have it
become Odd‐Eyes Dragon!

00:18:22.754 --> 00:18:24.021
But there's more...

00:18:24.021 --> 00:18:26.054
Next by tributing
Light Phoenix...

00:18:26.054 --> 00:18:28.554
I can evolve
Odd‐Eyes Dragon...

00:18:28.554 --> 00:18:31.154
And that's some
bad news for you!

00:18:31.154 --> 00:18:32.521
You are all talk!

00:18:32.521 --> 00:18:33.588
No.

00:18:33.588 --> 00:18:35.321
Talking didn't
work, remember?

00:18:35.321 --> 00:18:37.154
Now I'm all action.

00:18:37.154 --> 00:18:40.288
And you're all but defeated,
'cause this duel's showstopper

00:18:40.288 --> 00:18:41.988
is finally here...

00:18:41.988 --> 00:18:45.188
And it's here to stop
you, Officer 227!

00:18:45.188 --> 00:18:48.654
Introducing Odd‐Eyes
Saber Dragon!

00:18:50.221 --> 00:18:53.921
Saber Dragon attack Jutte Lord
with all of your might...!

00:19:00.088 --> 00:19:01.821
Big deal‐‐
Is that all ya got?

00:19:01.821 --> 00:19:03.254
No, it's not...

00:19:03.254 --> 00:19:06.521
'Cause now Odd‐Eyes Saber
Dragon's ability activates!

00:19:06.521 --> 00:19:09.821
When Odd‐Eyes Saber Dragon
destroys your monster in battle,

00:19:09.821 --> 00:19:12.554
it's allowed to destroy
another one of your monsters!

00:19:12.554 --> 00:19:14.021
No way!

00:19:14.021 --> 00:19:16.121
Say goodbye to
Goyo Emperor!

00:19:18.054 --> 00:19:21.221
With Goyo Emperor outta
the way, its special ability...

00:19:21.221 --> 00:19:23.121
is gone, too!

00:19:23.121 --> 00:19:24.821
(gasps)

00:19:24.821 --> 00:19:27.087
Without Goyo Emperor's
ability in play,

00:19:27.087 --> 00:19:29.721
Yuya gets
his monsters back!

00:19:29.721 --> 00:19:30.721
Whoa!

00:19:30.721 --> 00:19:32.221
He's got the goods!

00:19:32.221 --> 00:19:34.054
Yeah, Never
woulda thunk it!

00:19:34.054 --> 00:19:37.854
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon
attack 227 directly!

00:19:39.054 --> 00:19:41.754
An Action Card!

00:19:41.754 --> 00:19:44.787
There are two
Action Cards up ahead!

00:19:44.787 --> 00:19:48.921
If 227 gets 'em, he still has
achance to get out of this
mess!

00:19:48.921 --> 00:19:50.954
Who will get
to them first?

00:19:52.087 --> 00:19:53.187
That Action Card's...

00:19:53.187 --> 00:19:54.254
All mine!
All mine!

00:19:56.454 --> 00:19:57.521
Oh, yeah!

00:19:57.521 --> 00:19:58.454
I play...

00:19:58.454 --> 00:19:59.954
Evasion!

00:19:59.954 --> 00:20:01.787
Well, I got
the spell No Action!

00:20:01.787 --> 00:20:03.321
It negates your
Action Card,

00:20:03.321 --> 00:20:05.254
so there's no
evading my attack now!

00:20:08.987 --> 00:20:10.321
(gasping)

00:20:11.987 --> 00:20:13.254
(roaring)

00:20:18.521 --> 00:20:20.954
(cheering)

00:20:21.987 --> 00:20:25.387
And we have
our winner!

00:20:25.387 --> 00:20:27.221
Yuya...

00:20:27.221 --> 00:20:29.187
You won...

00:20:29.187 --> 00:20:31.221
But that means another
duelist is sent underground.

00:20:33.921 --> 00:20:37.487
(Jean)
Well, well, well...

00:20:37.487 --> 00:20:39.821
You say that
the Friendship Cup is bad,

00:20:39.821 --> 00:20:41.821
but it seems you had
no qualms winning.

00:20:43.287 --> 00:20:45.187
(cheering)

00:20:47.054 --> 00:20:48.854
<i>Congratulations, Yuya!</i>

00:20:48.854 --> 00:20:50.321
Just listen
to that crowd.

00:20:50.321 --> 00:20:52.254
They absolutely
adore you!

00:20:52.254 --> 00:20:55.121
Way to walk to the walk
instead of talk the talk.

00:20:55.121 --> 00:20:57.321
(crowd chanting)
Yuya, Yuya, Yuya!

00:20:57.321 --> 00:20:58.421
(woman)
Way to go!
(man)
Well done!

00:20:58.421 --> 00:20:59.621
(man)
227 was a chump.

00:20:59.621 --> 00:21:00.987
(man)
He's gone
for good!

00:21:00.987 --> 00:21:02.687
Oh, no...

00:21:02.687 --> 00:21:04.521
They don't get it...

00:21:04.521 --> 00:21:05.787
They still don't see
that dueling

00:21:05.787 --> 00:21:07.587
is supposed to be for fun.

00:21:10.887 --> 00:21:12.187
(groaning)

00:21:14.487 --> 00:21:16.587
Hold on...

00:21:16.587 --> 00:21:18.587
Wait, stop!

00:21:18.587 --> 00:21:19.654
Don't do it!

00:21:19.654 --> 00:21:21.254
Don't take him to
the underground.

00:21:21.254 --> 00:21:23.687
It's wrong!

00:21:23.687 --> 00:21:25.387
(straining)

00:21:25.387 --> 00:21:26.421
No!

00:21:26.421 --> 00:21:27.887
You can't!

00:21:27.887 --> 00:21:30.021
