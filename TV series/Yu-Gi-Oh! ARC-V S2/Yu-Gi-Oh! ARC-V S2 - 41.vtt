Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

Obelisk Force!

00:00:06.433 --> 00:00:09.033
Duel Academy's finally
come to this dimension.

00:00:09.033 --> 00:00:12.666
Their first order of business
must be to find Celina and Zuzu.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.733
And my job is to make sure
that doesn't happen.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.100
(man over bullhorn)
<i>This is Sector Security.</i>

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.433
<i>Stop where you are.</i>

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:21.666
Uhh!

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.066
(growling)

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:26.900
(thinking)
Sergey had better
not disappoint.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.333
Tell the other Lancers in
the underground where we are.

00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.233
I'll stay and keep Celina safe
till you come back.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.466
Drop your Duel Disk
and surrender.

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:40.466
Never!

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:42.800
So be it.
You can't stop us.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.866
How about me?

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.233
Sora...
This is unexpected.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:50.166
You can thank me later.

00:00:52.033 --> 00:00:54.566
Aah!

00:00:54.566 --> 00:00:57.900
(all groaning)

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.833
They won't be
bothering us anymore.

Huh?
Stay back... or else!

Riley can't protect
Celina forever.

00:02:36.666 --> 00:02:39.100
I gotta move it
before they lose it.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:40.900
(all gasping)

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.633

00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:55.633
(Yuya)
Go back to Duel Academy
where you belong!

00:02:57.533 --> 00:02:58.600
You okay?

00:03:01.866 --> 00:03:03.866
Don't worry, Celina!

00:03:03.866 --> 00:03:06.700
I won't let them take you!

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.733
Riley!

00:03:08.733 --> 00:03:12.200
It's okay.
Calm down.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.333
(anxious breathing)

00:03:17.633 --> 00:03:19.900
How did you wind up down here?

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.566
(Celina)
Riley saved me after I was
ambushed by Sector Security.

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.800
They tried to take me to Roget.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.133
For real?

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:29.100
Luckily,
Riley saved the day.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.666
It was three on one.

00:03:30.666 --> 00:03:32.433
It could've been
ten on one,

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:37.333
but that wouldn't have
been enough to stop Riley.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:41.500
Whoa, that's amazing!
Wish I could've seen it.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.866
Huh?
Huh?

00:03:44.066 --> 00:03:45.166
(sinister laughter)

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:56.066
Hah. I see the Professor still
has you on his leash, Barrett.

00:03:56.066 --> 00:03:59.100
Nice to see you, too, Celina.

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:03.500
If you think you're
bringing me back,

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.300
you're wrong, 'cause
I'm not going anywhere.

00:04:14.066 --> 00:04:16.566
Step aside.
You'll have to make me!

00:04:16.566 --> 00:04:18.333
Shouldn't be a problem.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:21.100
No one will stop me from
carrying out my mission.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.066
No one but me.

00:04:23.066 --> 00:04:28.300
You just made a bad decision.
And I'll make you regret it!

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.933

From what I saw, enough
to add up to trouble.

00:05:32.733 --> 00:05:34.900

I was dueling Yuya when these
guys on gliders appeared.

00:06:21.033 --> 00:06:24.233
A friend of Yuya's told me
they were hunting down Celina.

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:25.800
Guys on gliders?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:27.100
(Crow)
Yeah.

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.933
Shay called them
the Obelisk Force.

00:06:28.933 --> 00:06:30.266
Obelisk Force!?

00:06:30.266 --> 00:06:32.400
So, who was this
friend of Yuya's?

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:34.666
He said his name was Sora.

00:06:34.666 --> 00:06:38.100
Sora?
Has everyone traveled
to this dimension?

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:40.200
He's from the Duel Academy.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:41.966
Doesn't that
make him an enemy?

00:06:41.966 --> 00:06:45.533
Gong thinks so. But why'd he
call himself Yuya's friend?

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:48.200
I say we drop everything
and get to the bottom of this.

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:49.400
Good idea!

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.533
Aah!

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:51.866

Huh?

The word from above

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.833
is that Obelisk Force
just showed up here.

00:07:26.833 --> 00:07:28.000
It is true.

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.333
They are tracking down
Celina as we speak.

00:07:30.333 --> 00:07:32.766
She needs your help,
but you'll have to hurry.

00:07:32.766 --> 00:07:35.566
Right now, the only one
protecting her is Riley.

00:07:35.566 --> 00:07:37.833
That's a tall order
for someone so little.

00:07:37.833 --> 00:07:39.800
Obelisk will
take Riley apart.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.833
Quick!
Let's move out!

00:07:41.833 --> 00:07:44.233
(Moon Shadow)
Wait, Gong. You are
still needed here.

00:07:44.233 --> 00:07:45.100
Huh?
Huh?
Huh?

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.133
Zuzu is also a target.

00:07:47.133 --> 00:07:49.800
You must stay here
to keep watch over her.

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.366
If somehow she is tracked
here to the underground,

00:07:52.366 --> 00:07:55.700
alone, she will be
easily outmatched.

00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.266
Got it. Good luck.
Gong's with ya in spirit.

00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:01.466
Thanks.
Let's go!

Nice work, partner!

00:08:39.666 --> 00:08:42.200
Now I'll polish off
all the leftovers!

00:08:43.533 --> 00:08:46.000
Hey, put that‐‐ Hey!
(groaning)

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.900
(Shinji via P. A.)
My fellow Commons!
It's time for us to rise up!

00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.166
For years, the Topsiders
have ruled over us

00:08:53.166 --> 00:08:54.666
and treated us
like animals!

00:08:54.666 --> 00:08:57.100
But now we have a chance to
take control of the future!

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.833
Our tomorrow starts today!

00:09:00.833 --> 00:09:02.733
(cheering)
Down with the Topsiders!

00:09:02.733 --> 00:09:05.366
Yeah! First up is
takin' down the guards!

00:09:05.366 --> 00:09:08.433
Remember, together
we've got 'em outnumbered!

00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:11.266
We'll use all this junk
they dump to trash 'em!

00:09:11.266 --> 00:09:14.300
There's a riot
in Sorting Zone C!

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.266
The inmates are overpowering
our security guards.

00:09:17.266 --> 00:09:19.566
It's utter chaos.
We need backup

00:09:19.566 --> 00:09:22.433
before the situation
spirals out of control!

00:09:22.433 --> 00:09:24.133
(growling)

00:09:24.133 --> 00:09:28.033
Lock down all zones now!
Don't let anyone escape!

00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:31.133
(Terron)
Look, it's Crow!
Huh?

00:09:31.133 --> 00:09:33.700
How did you three
end up down here?

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:36.633
Security was after us and
a ninja hid us underground.

00:09:36.633 --> 00:09:38.266
Zuzu was with us, too!

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:40.333
Yeah, but she
just took off!

00:09:40.333 --> 00:09:42.000
Took off where!?

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.600
I will retrieve Celina!

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:48.166
Oppose me, and you must
face the savagery

00:09:48.166 --> 00:09:51.200
of my Beastborg monsters!

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:55.766
I activate Beastborg Fusioner
to summon one right away!

00:09:55.766 --> 00:09:59.466
I fuse Panther Warrior
and Dark Sentinel

00:09:59.466 --> 00:10:02.766
to mix the savagery
of a jungle hunter

00:10:02.766 --> 00:10:06.500
with the attack strength of
a high‐tech combat machine!

00:10:08.266 --> 00:10:12.400
I Fusion Summon the most
dangerous mercenary

00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:17.233

Beastborg Panther Predator!

00:10:17.233 --> 00:10:19.933
Panther Predator,
lock and load!

00:10:19.933 --> 00:10:23.166
Fire your Quasar Beam
to inflict damage

00:10:23.166 --> 00:10:26.066
equal to half
your attack points!

00:10:26.066 --> 00:10:27.866
(roaring)
Uhh!

00:10:27.866 --> 00:10:31.333
(groaning)

00:10:31.333 --> 00:10:34.966
I place these two cards
and end my turn.

00:10:37.400 --> 00:10:41.500
Celina, the Professor
ordered me to bring you back.

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:45.466
And as you know, I never
disobey a direct order.

00:10:46.833 --> 00:10:50.433
Well, I'm ordering you
to go back without me.

00:10:50.433 --> 00:10:53.733
Impossible. Celina,
what happened to the person

00:10:53.733 --> 00:10:55.766
who wanted to fight
on the front lines?

00:10:55.766 --> 00:10:58.666
Please, listen to me.
Come back peacefully

00:10:58.666 --> 00:11:01.500
and I'll convince the
Professor to make it happen.

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:05.566
Barrett,
that's not me anymore.

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:07.866
I've learned too much‐‐

00:11:07.866 --> 00:11:11.033
far too much
about Duel Academy.

00:11:11.033 --> 00:11:13.366
The Professor is
a destructive maniac

00:11:13.366 --> 00:11:16.766
with a mad dream, and I
won't be part of his scheme!

00:11:16.766 --> 00:11:19.500
We can't let her
go back there.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:21.033
She won't.
Huh?

00:11:21.033 --> 00:11:23.366
Celina's staying right here.

00:11:23.366 --> 00:11:25.633
And as for Duel Academy,

00:11:25.633 --> 00:11:29.166
its days of wrecking
people's lives are over!

00:11:29.166 --> 00:11:30.166

Huh?

Exercise?
Yeah.

00:11:54.700 --> 00:11:57.200

Slow down. This isn't how
you get to the elevator!

That's not an option.
They're expecting that.

Ha! We prefer "or else"!

Mom always thought
I should use my dueling

to make people smile,
and Dad felt the same way.

He felt the point of dueling
was to spread happiness.

00:13:00.206 --> 00:13:03.606
But how can I do that
and still protect Celina?

00:13:03.606 --> 00:13:07.306
What's wrong? Thinking of
going AWOL to avoid losing?

It worked!

00:17:42.006 --> 00:17:43.540
Next stop, Topside!

00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.640
Great news, Shinji!

00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:46.373
We broke into the vault

00:17:46.373 --> 00:17:48.940
and now we're breakin' out
our Duel Disks!

00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:51.606
Shinji,
mission accomplished!

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:53.173
We captured
the generator room

00:17:53.173 --> 00:17:55.906
and cut power to all
the security systems!

00:17:55.906 --> 00:18:00.073
Listen up, my fellow Commons.
Today is a new day!

00:18:00.073 --> 00:18:02.573
Today is the day
we've waited for!

00:18:02.573 --> 00:18:04.840
Our campaign against
the Topsiders has begun!

00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.873
<i>The underground is ours!</i>

00:18:06.873 --> 00:18:09.340
And now it's time
we take it to the streets!

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.840
We'll ride the conveyor belts
to the surface

00:18:11.840 --> 00:18:13.806
and take the future
into our own hands!

00:18:13.806 --> 00:18:15.706
Let's roll!
Power to the Commons!

00:18:15.706 --> 00:18:20.440
Thanks a lot. This was
truly a team effort.

00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:22.606
It was totally our pleasure.

00:18:22.606 --> 00:18:24.140
We've been
itchin' for action

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.640
ever since
we got down here.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:27.506
Our boss got tossed
in this dump

00:18:27.506 --> 00:18:29.106
and we haven't seen him
in, like, forever.

00:18:29.106 --> 00:18:31.440
We've been searchin' for
ways to get him outta here.

00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:33.340
We looked high and low,
but so far,

00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:35.073
we haven't found
a trace of Chojiro.

00:18:35.073 --> 00:18:36.406
(Chojiro)
'Til now, that is!

00:18:36.406 --> 00:18:37.340
Huh?
Huh?

00:18:39.106 --> 00:18:41.406
Chojiro!
Chojiro!

00:18:41.406 --> 00:18:43.206
Come on, let's go!
We're free!

00:18:43.206 --> 00:18:44.873
Let's get out a' here!
(laughter)

00:18:44.873 --> 00:18:46.873
Topsiders, here we come!

00:18:46.873 --> 00:18:48.773
Zuzu!

00:18:48.773 --> 00:18:51.340
♪

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:53.006
Gong found you!
Huh?

00:18:53.006 --> 00:18:54.573
Thank goodness!

00:18:54.573 --> 00:18:56.840
Gong was lookin'
all over for ya.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:59.606
Please, Gong!
Help me get to Yuya!

00:18:59.606 --> 00:19:01.373
I have a terrible feeling!

00:19:01.373 --> 00:19:05.573
My bracelet just glowed again.
I think Yuya's in danger!

00:19:05.573 --> 00:19:09.506
Uh‐oh! Gong wonders if
he ran into Obelisk Force.

00:19:09.506 --> 00:19:11.340
From Duel Academy?

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:12.840
They flew
into this dimension

00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:14.273
like a bunch of bats!

00:19:14.273 --> 00:19:15.640
Out of the way!
Topsiders are going down!

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:16.573
Huh?

00:19:16.573 --> 00:19:19.073
Move it or lose it!

00:19:19.073 --> 00:19:21.540
Zuzu!

00:19:21.540 --> 00:19:24.506
Gong!

00:19:24.506 --> 00:19:27.240
(panting)

00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:29.106
Hmm...

00:19:31.406 --> 00:19:33.073
Let's rock!

00:19:33.073 --> 00:19:34.140
Yeah!
Yeah!

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:36.806
Sir, we've spotted
two targets

00:19:36.806 --> 00:19:38.840
in Sector
Romeo‐Tango‐55‐‐

00:19:38.840 --> 00:19:40.706
Yuya Sakaki and
Riley Akaba.

00:19:40.706 --> 00:19:41.773
Uhh!

00:19:41.773 --> 00:19:43.173
They appear to be
engaged in battle

00:19:43.173 --> 00:19:45.006
with a unit
from Obelisk Force.

00:19:45.006 --> 00:19:47.106
It appears that Celina
is also present!

00:19:47.106 --> 00:19:48.206
Celina?

00:19:48.206 --> 00:19:50.673
(thinking)
The Lancers and Duel Academy

00:19:50.673 --> 00:19:52.073
are both fighting over her!

00:19:52.073 --> 00:19:56.306
But I won't let either group
take control of dear Celina!

00:19:56.306 --> 00:19:58.373
(whimpering)

00:20:02.073 --> 00:20:05.040
(screaming)

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.273
I can't go back.

00:20:07.273 --> 00:20:08.806
(gasping)

00:20:08.806 --> 00:20:10.440
(thinking)
I have to focus!

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:12.906
Celina and Riley
are depending on me.

00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:15.473
Barrett might have the lead,
but he must have

00:20:15.473 --> 00:20:18.206
some weakness I can
turn to my advantage.

00:20:18.206 --> 00:20:19.940
If I pick apart his game,

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.906
his whole strategy revolves
around his trap card.

00:20:22.906 --> 00:20:24.240
Without that card,

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:27.006
he can't tie my monsters
down in chains.

00:20:27.006 --> 00:20:29.540
So what can I do
to counter it?

00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.740
As long as I have
a Beastborg on my field,

00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:37.573
my trap keeps 'em
locked up.

00:20:37.573 --> 00:20:39.740
(thinking)
So if I can find a way

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:42.006
to take out Beastborg
Panther Predator,

00:20:42.006 --> 00:20:44.440
then Barrett's trap
would bite the dust, too!

00:20:45.506 --> 00:20:47.640
Huh?
Okay!

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:49.206
Even though Salutiger

00:20:49.206 --> 00:20:50.373
and Silver Claw
are chained up,

00:20:50.373 --> 00:20:52.706
I can still overlay them!

00:20:54.673 --> 00:20:57.706
With these two monsters,
I build the Overlay Network

00:20:57.706 --> 00:21:01.706
and Xyz Summon
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:21:01.706 --> 00:21:04.406
Go!

00:21:04.406 --> 00:21:06.806
(roaring)

00:21:10.906 --> 00:21:14.006
(thinking)
When Dark Rebellion
destroys his Beastborg,

00:21:14.006 --> 00:21:16.940
his trap card
will be history!

00:21:16.940 --> 00:21:18.240
Attack!
Halt!

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.506
What?

00:21:19.506 --> 00:21:24.606
I activate Beastborg Medal
of the Crimson Chain!

00:21:24.606 --> 00:21:27.540
Listen up, grunt!
You can't outsmart me!

00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:29.440
My Crimson Chain activates

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.740
when you summon a monster
from your Extra Deck.

00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:35.773
Once again, your monster
can't go on the attack.

00:21:35.773 --> 00:21:39.406
Your mighty Dragon
is now harmless!

00:21:39.406 --> 00:21:40.540
Oh, no!

00:21:40.540 --> 00:21:41.473
Huh?

00:21:43.573 --> 00:21:46.640
I'm doomed!

00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:48.806
