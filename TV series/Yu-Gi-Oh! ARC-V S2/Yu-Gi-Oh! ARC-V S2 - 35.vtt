WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.466
(Yuya)
Previously on
Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V...

00:00:04.366 --> 00:00:05.500
(man)
Zuzu Boyle...

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:06.600
What do you want?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.200
We have you surrounded.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.233
Director, we have the fugitive
and her accomplices in custody.

00:00:12.233 --> 00:00:13.733
<i>Well done.</i>

00:00:13.733 --> 00:00:15.766
Bring them in
immediately.

00:00:15.766 --> 00:00:17.333
(Sora)
Heads up!

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.033
Sora!

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:22.733
Looks like
I'm late to the party‐‐

00:00:22.733 --> 00:00:24.433
hope you don't mind
if I drop in!

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:28.566
You told me
they were in custody!

00:00:28.566 --> 00:00:30.300
<i>Yes... director...</i>

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.533
but some kid who can Fusion
Summon got in our way.

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.466
Fusion.

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:37.200
It must be Sora.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.233
Attention, security...

00:00:39.233 --> 00:00:41.700
Zuzu Boyle hasevaded
apprehension.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.800
If you spot her,
arrest her on sight.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.566
<i>Use any means necessary.</i>

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:51.866
And when I say by any means,
I mean by any means!

00:00:51.866 --> 00:00:55.733
Battling for a spot
in the semifinals is...

00:00:55.733 --> 00:00:59.366
Yugo and Celina!

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:02.866
Sergey and Yuya are
very important to me.

00:01:02.866 --> 00:01:04.766
But so is Celina.

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.800
For the city
to be all mine,

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.433
these three are instrumental

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:12.166
in my plans
for a total checkmate.

I'm counting on you.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.200
You have to keep Zuzu
safe from Roget.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.466
Because the sooner
we're all back together,

00:02:31.466 --> 00:02:35.100
the sooner we can stop
all the fighting.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.066
And get home.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:41.366
(crowd, chanting)
We love Yugo! We love Yugo!

00:02:41.366 --> 00:02:43.366
We love Yugo...

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.933
Well, Rin Rin,

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.566
I'm one step closer
to the finals.

00:02:47.566 --> 00:02:49.366
The sun may be setting,

00:02:49.366 --> 00:02:52.600
but not on our dreams
of winning the Friendship Cup.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.166
I wish you could
be here with me...

00:02:54.166 --> 00:02:56.333
well, I guess
you kinda were with me,

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:59.466
'cause I met that girl
that looks just like you.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:02.300
Mark my words.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.966
I will win
this duel for you, Rin.

00:03:04.966 --> 00:03:06.600
Promise.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.666
Look! Celina is
moseying on over

00:03:08.666 --> 00:03:10.033
to the startin' line...

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:13.233
(crowd, chanting)
Celina! Celina! Celina!

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.133
So, you're the next chump
to lose to me, huh?

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:20.100
Huh?

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.633
You've better have
brought your "A" game

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.033
'cause I'm coming at you
with everything I got!

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.233
Are you hearin' me?

00:03:26.233 --> 00:03:27.433
You will be lucky
to make it through

00:03:27.433 --> 00:03:30.200
in one piece‐‐
now, let's duel!

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.333
Huh?

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:33.666
(laughing)
It's you!

00:03:33.666 --> 00:03:34.933
Huh?

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.633
Rin!

00:03:36.633 --> 00:03:39.400
I said duel,
not drool!

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.933
(thinking)
<i>Wait... Rin...</i>

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:47.433
is that the girlZuzu
was talking about?

00:03:47.433 --> 00:03:49.033
The one who
looks like us?

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.066
(man)
What's got into Yugo?

00:03:51.066 --> 00:03:54.100
(man 2)
Looked like
a knuckle sandwich.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.333
Rin?

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:57.066
I'm not Rin!

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:58.733
The name's Celina!

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:06.733
Course, you are...

00:04:06.733 --> 00:04:08.666
oopsie.

00:04:09.933 --> 00:04:12.300
If you really
aren't Rin,

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.766
why do you have the same
bad breath as her?

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:15.900
Take a hike!

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.966
Aaah!

00:04:20.133 --> 00:04:22.400
Rin Rin!
Take a seat!

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.666
Rin Rin!
Take a hint!

00:04:24.666 --> 00:04:26.900
Rin Rin!
Take off!

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.600
Reckon there's
a mix‐up down there.

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.600
Looks like Yugo's mistakin'
Celina for a friend o' his,

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:33.733
And Celina's gone
n' mistaken Yugo

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:37.233
for a walkin',
talkin' punchin' bag.

00:04:37.233 --> 00:04:38.833
Oh, yeah.

00:04:38.833 --> 00:04:41.133
There's supposed to be
a duel happenin'!

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:42.800
So, whaddaya say
we start off

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.200
the final match
of the second round?

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.433
Let's fire up the Action Field
Crossover Acceleration!

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:53.533
<i>Duel Mode engaged!</i>

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:55.933
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:57.333
Standing by?

00:04:57.333 --> 00:04:59.233
But my Runner's
not even standing up!

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.100
(Melissa)
On your mark...
get set... go!

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.666
(both)
Let's duel!

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:10.733
Whoa! Celina took off
like a bolt of lightning!

00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:13.666
If she high tails it past
the Duel Palace gates first,

00:05:13.666 --> 00:05:16.000
she'll get to go first!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.133
Dear Celina,

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:20.133
it's imperative
you win this match.

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:22.666
As such, I'll assist
as best I can.

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.166
Patch me into
the course control grid

00:05:26.166 --> 00:05:28.100
and be on standby.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.466
(man)
<i>Yes, director.</i>

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.233
(thinking)
Okay, so maybe that
isn't Rin Rin.

00:05:37.233 --> 00:05:39.000
But Celina looks
just like her.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.766
<i>Just like Zuzu did.</i>

00:05:40.766 --> 00:05:43.433
Funny thing is,
Rin Rin and I always

00:05:43.433 --> 00:05:46.633
dreamt about dueling each
other in front of a big
crowd.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.366
I guess, in a way, we're
finally getting our wish.

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:54.866
And I gotta say,
it feels as rockin'

00:05:54.866 --> 00:05:56.533
<i>as I thought it would.</i>

00:05:56.533 --> 00:05:59.233
Hey! What's with
the silly grin on your face?

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.833
You're seriously
weirding me out, buddy.

00:06:01.833 --> 00:06:04.200
So snap out of it!

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.833
Come on,
I saw your duel with Sylvio,

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.833
I know you got game.

00:06:08.833 --> 00:06:10.100
Huh?

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.433
I want your very best.

00:06:11.433 --> 00:06:13.766
Buh... uh?

00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:15.866
I know you got game.
I want your very best.

00:06:15.866 --> 00:06:17.400
Suuuure!

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.266
Whoa!
Yugo takes the lead!

00:06:20.266 --> 00:06:22.866
And he's first
through the gates

00:06:22.866 --> 00:06:24.666
<i>so he gets to go first!</i>

00:06:26.733 --> 00:06:28.133
All right!

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:29.966
Let's get
this duel started!

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:33.000
And, hey, what better way
is there to start than

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.866
with a steady beat?

00:06:34.866 --> 00:06:38.033
I summon Speedroid
Den‐Den Daiko Duke!

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.966
Then I'll end my turn.

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:46.366
What?

00:06:46.366 --> 00:06:48.033
That's really
your very best?

00:06:48.033 --> 00:06:51.500
A measly monster with
just 1200 attack points?

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.000
Uh...

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.600
Guess it didn't
occur to you

00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:57.300
to maybe play
a facedown as well?

00:06:58.566 --> 00:07:01.500
Remember the time
I said that you got game?

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.833
I take it back.

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:07.100
It's my turn now!

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.066
I summon Lunalight
Purple Butterfly!

00:07:10.066 --> 00:07:11.733
Take flight!

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:19.300
Next I'll play
Polymerization

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.300
'cause only a fool
plays one card!

00:07:21.300 --> 00:07:23.900
So I made a mistake‐‐
let it go, Rin.

00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:25.566
Call me 'Rin'
one more time,

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:27.000
and you'll really
start to understand

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.866
the meaning of the word
"mistake"‐‐ got it?

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.466
Now then,
where was I?

00:07:30.466 --> 00:07:33.666
Ahh, yes, the spell
Polymerization.

00:07:33.666 --> 00:07:35.133
With it,
I fuse together

00:07:35.133 --> 00:07:38.466
Lunalight Blue Cat
and Lunalight White Rabbit!

00:07:38.466 --> 00:07:42.166
By combining the powers of
these two magnificent monsters,

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:45.100
I can create
a new lunar legend!

00:07:48.433 --> 00:07:50.200
I Fusion Summon

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.566
Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:07:52.566 --> 00:07:54.033
Celina's
summoning skills

00:07:54.033 --> 00:07:56.666
are as slick as
a cat's reflexes!

00:07:56.666 --> 00:07:59.666
Now, Cat Dancer's
special ability activates!

00:07:59.666 --> 00:08:02.000
By tributing
one of my monsters,

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.133
she can attack twice.

00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:07.566
Huh? That doesn't
sound fair!

00:08:07.566 --> 00:08:11.200
So, say so long
to Lunalight Purple Butterfly

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:15.266
and hello to Cat Dancer's
first attack!

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:17.566
Blast 'em!

00:08:17.566 --> 00:08:19.133
B last 'em!

00:08:19.133 --> 00:08:20.766
Rin...

00:08:20.766 --> 00:08:23.900
Lunalight
Cat Dancer... go!

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:31.800
It's not all bad‐‐

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.833
one drawback
of Dancer's special ability

00:08:33.833 --> 00:08:36.366
is that your monster survives
the initial attack.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:37.833
(growling)

00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:39.300
That's hardly a drawback.

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:41.400
After all,
Yugo still takes damage,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:43.100
and at this rate
his life points will be

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:44.700
runnin' on empty
in no time!

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.000
Okay, Cat Dancer,
time for take two.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.100
let Daiko Duke
have it once more!

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:51.700
Go Full Moon Mayhem!

00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:05.000
Yugo's already lost
2400 life points!

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.933
<i>Can he mount a comeback,</i>

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:09.833
or will Celina continue
to sink her claws in?

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:17.066
(Melissa)
Yugo's already lost
2400 life points!

00:09:17.066 --> 00:09:18.766
<i>Can he mount a comeback,</i>

00:09:18.766 --> 00:09:21.766
or will Celina continue
to sink her claws in?

00:09:21.766 --> 00:09:24.833
I must say, I've always
been more of a dog person,

00:09:24.833 --> 00:09:26.666
but this Celina's not bad.

00:09:26.666 --> 00:09:31.166
I completely agree, darling‐‐
she certainly is the cat's meow.

00:09:33.333 --> 00:09:34.700
Yay, Celina!

00:09:34.700 --> 00:09:36.666
You give me
the chickenpimples.

00:09:36.666 --> 00:09:39.233
Let's go, Yugo, otherwise,
change your name to Yu‐can't!

00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:40.733
I'm in a real
bad spot...

00:09:40.733 --> 00:09:43.600
(Rin Rin)
You just need
to focus, Yugo!

00:09:44.833 --> 00:09:46.133
Seriously!

00:09:46.133 --> 00:09:48.233
If you weren't always
getting distracted,

00:09:48.233 --> 00:09:50.333
you'd be on the podium
winning a trophy.

00:09:50.333 --> 00:09:52.466
And not
some bath towels.

00:09:52.466 --> 00:09:54.300
You've gotta learn
to concentrate.

00:09:54.300 --> 00:09:55.866
Can you do that
for me?

00:09:55.866 --> 00:09:58.600
All right,
fine‐‐ I will!

00:09:58.600 --> 00:10:01.333
I will...

00:10:01.333 --> 00:10:02.466
for you, Rin.

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:04.700
All right, Yugo.

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:06.266
Time to get going.

00:10:06.266 --> 00:10:07.966
(straining)

00:10:07.966 --> 00:10:10.433
Man, you can't keep me
all alone in here.

00:10:12.466 --> 00:10:14.200
Wait, I'm not alone.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:17.066
I'm never alone as long as
I have my friends in my deck.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.466
You're up‐‐
I end my turn!

00:10:21.466 --> 00:10:23.833
Then I'll finally begin.

00:10:23.833 --> 00:10:27.066
And this time, Celina,
with my very best.

00:10:27.066 --> 00:10:29.433
Because I made
a promise to Rin Rin,

00:10:29.433 --> 00:10:31.133
and it's a promise
I won't break!

00:10:31.133 --> 00:10:32.933
And it all
adds up to me winning.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.433
Too bad, 'cause
come my next turn,

00:10:36.433 --> 00:10:38.000
I'm taking you down,
Yugo.

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.133
Sure, give me
your very best.

00:10:42.133 --> 00:10:44.833
'Cause no matter
what you think,

00:10:44.833 --> 00:10:47.266
this duel isn't over yet.

00:10:47.266 --> 00:10:48.533
Not even close.

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:50.633
Don't believe me?

00:10:50.633 --> 00:10:53.200
No problem!
You will soon enough!

00:10:53.200 --> 00:10:54.833
It's my turn!

00:10:56.633 --> 00:10:58.966
Time for me
to go supersonic!

00:10:58.966 --> 00:11:01.133
I'm summoning
my spinning sidekick

00:11:01.133 --> 00:11:03.133
Speedroid Terrortop!

00:11:09.466 --> 00:11:10.866
But there's more.

00:11:10.866 --> 00:11:12.633
Next, I'm rolling out this.

00:11:12.633 --> 00:11:14.100
It's an eyeful.

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.366
Here's looking at you,
Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice!

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:20.800
But I won't be
getting too attached

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.866
'cause I'm tuning Level 1
Red‐Eyed Dice

00:11:22.866 --> 00:11:24.966
with my Level 3
Terrortop!

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.533
I Synchro Summon...

00:11:33.533 --> 00:11:35.633
Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle!

00:11:40.566 --> 00:11:43.300
(Melissa)
And just like that,
Yugo's back in the saddle

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.333
<i>and ready to battle.</i>

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:48.200
So you were finally able
to make a decent move.

00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.766
But my monster's still
the strongest out on the field.

00:11:51.766 --> 00:11:55.366
Sorry, Yugo,
but I'm still not impressed.

00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:56.933
I agree with you, Celina,

00:11:56.933 --> 00:11:58.500
you shouldn't be
impressed yet.

00:11:58.500 --> 00:11:59.733
What?

00:11:59.733 --> 00:12:02.666
Synchro Summoning
some super cool monster

00:12:02.666 --> 00:12:04.700
doesn't make up
for my slow start.

00:12:05.966 --> 00:12:07.566
But I'm redlining now.

00:12:07.566 --> 00:12:09.600
And that's
how I like to duel!

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.266
Ya know, in the moment‐‐
making it up as I go.

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:13.600
Trusting in some luck!

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.933
That's no way to duel!

00:12:14.933 --> 00:12:17.000
You have to have
a plan to win!

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.500
Plans are overrated.

00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.233
Huh?
But not this guy!

00:12:21.233 --> 00:12:23.133
And I think that
you'll agree once you see

00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:24.733
its special ability!

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.700
When it battles a monster,
its attack points double!

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:31.333
Now, go!

00:12:34.366 --> 00:12:36.200
Yugo's making his move.

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.333
If this attack connects,

00:12:37.333 --> 00:12:39.400
Celina will be
completely defenseless!

00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:43.766
Adjust course point
delta five to gamma 10.

00:12:43.766 --> 00:12:46.400
This should get Celina
back on the right track.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:50.466
(computer voice)
Changing Course Point
delta five to gamma ten.

00:12:52.266 --> 00:12:53.766
Huh? What's happening?

00:12:53.766 --> 00:12:55.733
(voice)
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:12:55.733 --> 00:12:58.033
Course change
initiated.

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:06.933
<i>(computer beeping)</i>

00:13:06.933 --> 00:13:09.300
Hey, my Duel Runner's
zigging instead of zagging!

00:13:11.866 --> 00:13:13.333
Aah!

00:13:13.333 --> 00:13:15.800
Oh, man‐‐
this is gonna be close!

00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:17.433
(straining)

00:13:22.300 --> 00:13:25.300
Oh, man! That twist
nearly twisted Yugo!

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:26.600
Shifting gears is
one thing,

00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.600
but shifting courses
isdownright dangerous!

00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.733
This new path
will lead Celina

00:13:31.733 --> 00:13:35.900
straight to an Action Card
that will be rather useful.

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:39.433
An Action Card!

00:13:39.433 --> 00:13:41.866
I play the Action Spell
Big Escape!

00:13:41.866 --> 00:13:44.633
So, now your attack
is no good!

00:13:45.833 --> 00:13:47.566
Well, that stinks
'cause now my Puzzle's

00:13:47.566 --> 00:13:49.600
attack points are gonna
drop all the way back down

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:51.200
to a measly 1300.

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:53.200
Celina sure got
lucky there!

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:55.033
That course change
changed the course

00:13:55.033 --> 00:13:56.533
of this entire duel!

00:13:56.533 --> 00:13:58.700
<i>Yugo can't be happy!</i>

00:13:58.700 --> 00:14:01.066
Aww, I totally
thought I had ya!

00:14:01.066 --> 00:14:02.166
Huh?

00:14:02.166 --> 00:14:04.400
Nice pick up back there!

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:06.066
You got some
serious skills!

00:14:06.066 --> 00:14:07.633
(chuckling)

00:14:07.633 --> 00:14:08.966
But they're seriously

00:14:08.966 --> 00:14:11.733
no match for me
and my monsters!

00:14:11.733 --> 00:14:15.766
I place two cards facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:15.766 --> 00:14:17.100
(chuckling)

00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.633
It looks like the Director
is up to new tricks.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:24.666
Celina's victory is
close at hand.

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:27.700
The only thing
left to do now is squeeze!

00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.100
Hey Yugo, 'member when I said
I was gonna beat you next turn?

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:42.833
Well, next turn is now!

00:14:42.833 --> 00:14:45.433
Uh‐oh, I don't like
the sound of this.

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:47.666
Celina doesn't
just look like Rin.

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:49.166
She's tough like her, too.

00:14:49.166 --> 00:14:50.400
Maybe more!

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:51.733
Here goes!

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.933
First, I summon
Lunalight Black Sheep!

00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:02.000
And next I play
the spell Polymerization!

00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:04.033
I fuse
Lunalight Black Sheep

00:15:04.033 --> 00:15:06.600
and Lunalight
Cat Dancer!

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:09.500
By combining the reflexes
of a fierce feline

00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.300
with the cunning covertness
of a stealthy beast,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:15.333
I can create
a new lunar legend!

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:20.166
I Fusion Summon!

00:15:20.166 --> 00:15:22.566
Now, appear,
sleek creature of the night,

00:15:22.566 --> 00:15:25.133
and ready
those razor sharp claws!

00:15:25.133 --> 00:15:28.366
Lunalight Panther Dancer is
on the prowl!

00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.966
But I'm not done yet,
and neither is my Black Sheep!

00:15:35.966 --> 00:15:37.900
When it's used
to Fusion Summon,

00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.866
I can bring it back to my hand
from my graveyard!

00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.833
Panther Dancer...

00:15:44.833 --> 00:15:45.900
Pounce!

00:15:45.900 --> 00:15:48.433
Attack Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle!

00:15:50.433 --> 00:15:52.533
Uh‐oh, it looks
like Yugo could be

00:15:52.533 --> 00:15:54.333
takin' a permanent cat nap!

00:15:54.333 --> 00:15:55.566
(growling)

00:15:55.566 --> 00:15:57.033
I can declaw this!

00:15:57.033 --> 00:15:59.566
Puzzle's special ability
activates,

00:15:59.566 --> 00:16:01.400
doubling
its attack points!

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:06.066
Smart play! Since Puzzle has
more attack points,

00:16:06.066 --> 00:16:08.566
Yugo will take
less damage.

00:16:08.566 --> 00:16:10.933
As though I didn't
see that coming.

00:16:10.933 --> 00:16:14.366
Panther Dancer's
special ability activates!

00:16:14.366 --> 00:16:17.733
It lets me attack
your monster twice!

00:16:17.733 --> 00:16:21.500
Wait‐‐ wasn't that the ability
of your other monster, too?!

00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.633
Yep, seems like
my Cats enjoy

00:16:23.633 --> 00:16:25.366
digging their claws
into your monsters

00:16:25.366 --> 00:16:27.566
and treating them
like a scratching post.

00:16:32.900 --> 00:16:35.533
Looks like Yugo's life points
have sprung a leak!

00:16:38.666 --> 00:16:40.866
And it sure looks like
your Puzzle's attack points

00:16:40.866 --> 00:16:43.100
have sprung
a leak as well!

00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.066
Oh, man, she sure
had this planned!

00:16:46.066 --> 00:16:49.366
Celina has the monsters,
life points, and momentum.

00:16:49.366 --> 00:16:51.233
This duel's done.

00:16:51.233 --> 00:16:52.766
Well, Yugo,
this is it.

00:16:52.766 --> 00:16:54.766
No! I can't
go out like this!

00:16:54.766 --> 00:16:58.000
(Melissa)
Looks like Yugo is really
starting to panic here.

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:02.200
(thinking) C'mon,
Yugo, you gotta win.

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:03.666
<i>For Rin Rin.</i>

00:17:03.666 --> 00:17:04.866
<i>But how?</i>

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:09.400
I got it!
Here goes!

00:17:12.566 --> 00:17:16.066
Oh, no!
An Action Card!

00:17:16.066 --> 00:17:18.533
Adjust course point
Zulu Lima Two

00:17:18.533 --> 00:17:20.466
to Delta Mike One.

00:17:20.466 --> 00:17:22.333
<i>(siren blaring)</i>

00:17:22.333 --> 00:17:23.833
(voice)
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:17:23.833 --> 00:17:26.366
Course change
initiated.

00:17:26.366 --> 00:17:28.733
Seriously?

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.566
The duel course
changed again?

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:38.100
Something's up for sure.

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:40.300
(Melissa)
Land sakes‐‐ 'cause
of the course change,

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.133
Yugo couldn't lasso
that Action Card!

00:17:42.133 --> 00:17:45.033
(chuckling)
How unexpected.

00:17:45.033 --> 00:17:46.933
Roget's constant
interfering

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:50.700
has made this duel
more entertaining!

00:17:50.700 --> 00:17:53.300
Talk about bad luck.

00:17:53.300 --> 00:17:55.500
I can't catch
a break here.

00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.666
It's like...

00:17:56.666 --> 00:17:58.800
someone has it out for me
or something.

00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.400
First, Celina lucks
into an Action Card,

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:03.766
and then I luck
outta one.

00:18:03.766 --> 00:18:06.133
So much for winning this
for Rin Rin.

00:18:06.133 --> 00:18:08.133
I really believed
I could deliver a "W,"

00:18:08.133 --> 00:18:09.500
but I was all wrong.

00:18:10.733 --> 00:18:13.400
Makes me wonder
what Rin Rin ever saw in me.

00:18:13.400 --> 00:18:15.733
(Rin Rin) Make up
your mind already!

00:18:17.100 --> 00:18:18.433
Come on!

00:18:18.433 --> 00:18:19.800
You've been staring
at your hand

00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:22.166
for almost
an hour now, Yugo!

00:18:22.166 --> 00:18:25.000
You don't have any moves
left to make!

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:27.166
Face it.
The duel's over!

00:18:27.166 --> 00:18:29.100
I've won!
Just give up!

00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:30.266
No way, Rin!

00:18:30.266 --> 00:18:32.600
That's one move
I'll never make!

00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:34.466
(sighing)
Yeah, I know.

00:18:34.466 --> 00:18:35.966
And...

00:18:35.966 --> 00:18:38.266
that's one of my favorite things
about you, Yugo,

00:18:38.266 --> 00:18:41.366
that no matter what,
you never give up.

00:18:41.366 --> 00:18:44.200
Oh, yeah!
That's what she saw!

00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:45.833
The course has changed,

00:18:45.833 --> 00:18:48.366
but you losing... hasn't!

00:18:48.366 --> 00:18:49.600
Panther Dancer,

00:18:49.600 --> 00:18:51.400
attack Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.700
and shred the rest
of Yugo's life points!

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.066
Panther Dancer,
attack Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle

00:19:00.066 --> 00:19:03.533
and shred the rest
of Yugo's life points!

00:19:03.533 --> 00:19:04.733
It's a long shot,

00:19:04.733 --> 00:19:07.533
but I play the trap card
Re‐Dyce‐Cle!

00:19:08.866 --> 00:19:11.233
First, I have
to choose a Synchro Monster

00:19:11.233 --> 00:19:13.833
in my Extra Deck
that I want to summon.

00:19:13.833 --> 00:19:16.933
So I choose
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:19:25.900 --> 00:19:27.866
Odd‐Eyes...

00:19:27.866 --> 00:19:31.033
Next, I summon a Dice monster
from my graveyard.

00:19:31.033 --> 00:19:33.466
So, come on out,
Red‐Eyed Dice.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.900
Then I roll a die,

00:19:39.900 --> 00:19:43.266
and Red‐Eyed Dice's Level
becomes the number I roll.

00:19:43.266 --> 00:19:44.866
So, if I want
to Synchro Summon

00:19:44.866 --> 00:19:48.966
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,
I gotta roll a three!

00:19:48.966 --> 00:19:51.900
If not,
all the monsters I have out,

00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:54.300
well, they won't be
out for long.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:56.000
They'll be destroyed.

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.033
That's some risk
you're taking!

00:19:58.033 --> 00:20:01.366
So then it all comes down
to this one die roll!

00:20:01.366 --> 00:20:04.633
You said you wanted me to give
you my very best, Celina,

00:20:04.633 --> 00:20:07.333
well, I'm giving you
my best and my all!

00:20:07.333 --> 00:20:10.766
Here goes.
Come on, number three!

00:20:21.833 --> 00:20:24.200
What‐‐ no way!
Yeah‐‐ yes way!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:27.233
My Red‐Eyed Dice's
Level becomes 3!

00:20:27.233 --> 00:20:28.666
And now...

00:20:30.966 --> 00:20:32.600
Level 3 Red‐Eyed Dice

00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.400
tunes with Level 4
Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle!

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:43.400
Beat your wings to whip up
a whirlwind of destruction!

00:20:47.966 --> 00:20:50.200
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:53.200
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:58.666
Absolutely astoundin'!

00:20:58.666 --> 00:21:00.233
All thanks
to one roll of the die,

00:21:00.233 --> 00:21:03.600
Yugo may now be rolling
on to a big victory!

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:08.600
In case
you hadn't noticed,

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.766
my monster still has
more attack points,

00:21:10.766 --> 00:21:12.900
So really,
not much has changed.

00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:14.333
Are you sure?

00:21:14.333 --> 00:21:16.933
'Cause you should always
expect the unexpected!

00:21:21.466 --> 00:21:23.833
(roaring)

00:21:34.433 --> 00:21:36.833
(Yuya)
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon?

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:43.466
Celina?

00:21:44.266 --> 00:21:45.866
Time to end this!

00:21:51.466 --> 00:21:52.866
(both)
Here I go...

00:21:52.866 --> 00:21:54.766
Showtime!
