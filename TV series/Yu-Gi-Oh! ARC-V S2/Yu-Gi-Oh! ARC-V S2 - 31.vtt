WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.000
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc V."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.133
You're going down,
just like the Topsiders.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.766
(thinking)
<i>I have to win this</i>

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:11.500
and unite the people
of this world.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.500
Just like Zuzu
tried to do.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.066
I summon Tuning Magician
in Defense Mode.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.233
(giggling)

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:22.866
(thinking)
I wonder how that card found
its way into Yuya's deck.

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:24.466
<i>But more importantly,</i>

00:00:24.466 --> 00:00:26.800
I wonder if he even knows
how to use it.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.500
Hama the Conquering Bow,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.366
attack and destroy
his Magician!

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:33.533
I Synchro Summon!

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:35.733
Enlightenment
Paladin!

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.666
Huh?

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.333
Paladin, take out
Hama the Conquering Bow!

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.700
(booming)

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.666
When it destroys
a monster in battle,

00:00:46.666 --> 00:00:50.233
you take damage equal
to your monster's attack points.

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.000
Aah!

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.400
In what's gotta
be the greatest

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.100
come‐from‐behind
victory I ever saw,

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.733
Yuya crushes it!

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:03.933
Perhaps this pawn will prove
useful after all.

After withstanding wave after
wave of wicked wasp attacks,

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.166
Yuya Sakaki managed
to lasso a victory

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:17.733
from Shinji Weber,

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:21.066
and now the winner's
headed back to the pits!

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:22.666
Hey, Yuya!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.066
No time, Sam.

00:02:25.066 --> 00:02:26.500
(man)
You topped that Common!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.300
(second man)
...even for someone like you.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.600
You sent him to the Underground
where he belongs.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.133
...troublemaking Common...

00:02:32.133 --> 00:02:35.766
You shut him up
and shut his rebellion down!

00:02:35.766 --> 00:02:38.033
This is Yuya's fault!

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:40.100
Shinji's a Common
like we are.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.066
He was fighting
so that we could be free,

00:02:42.066 --> 00:02:45.200
but now, thanks to Yuya,
he's going away forever.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.566
Yuya ain't with us!

00:02:46.566 --> 00:02:48.933
I betcha he's working
for the Topsiders.

00:02:48.933 --> 00:02:50.300
(man)
You don't wanna help us!

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.400
(second man)
You must be one of 'em!

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.233
No, you got it all wrong,
I swear!

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:56.133
Just hold them horses.

00:02:56.133 --> 00:02:58.500
Look, y'all may not wanna
warm up to the winner

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:59.866
of this here duel,

00:02:59.866 --> 00:03:02.466
but it was a humdinger
of a match!

00:03:02.466 --> 00:03:05.533
So, Topsiders and Commons,

00:03:05.533 --> 00:03:07.300
in the spirit
of the Friendship Cup,

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.800
let's come together as one

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.766
and give our winner
a hearty round of applause.

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:13.200
Bravo, Yuya.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.166
I say, you're tops
in my book, Yuya.

00:03:16.166 --> 00:03:17.366
Topsider!

00:03:17.366 --> 00:03:18.966
You're a zero!

00:03:18.966 --> 00:03:21.266
Well done, Yuya!
You make me sick!

00:03:21.266 --> 00:03:23.533
How much are they payin' ya?

00:03:23.533 --> 00:03:25.466
Hope it was worth it!

00:03:25.466 --> 00:03:27.733
(thinking)
All I wanted
was to win the duel

00:03:27.733 --> 00:03:29.766
and win over
the crowd.

00:03:29.766 --> 00:03:32.133
But winning made
everything worse.

00:03:32.133 --> 00:03:34.500
Now, instead of bringing
people together,

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.833
I drove the Topsiders and
Commons even farther apart.

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:39.933
<i>I gotta fix this.</i>

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:42.000
<i>But maybe Jack was right.</i>

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.600
Maybe I don't have
what it takes.

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:54.033
It's over.

00:03:54.033 --> 00:03:55.300
Ugh?

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.666
(clapping)

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.266
Why is Roget here?

00:04:01.266 --> 00:04:02.833
Well, I'll be!

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.966
Looks like Yuya has
a new number‐one fan!

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:07.800
The director of security
himself.

00:04:09.366 --> 00:04:10.933
Splendid work, Yuya.

00:04:10.933 --> 00:04:13.700
You've demonstrated
admirable dexterity.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.966
The way you boldly
transitioned from

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.733
Pendulum
to Synchro Summoning

00:04:17.733 --> 00:04:21.266
actually made me gasp with
excitement and appreciation.

00:04:21.266 --> 00:04:24.266
I knew it wasn't a mistake
to keep my eye on you.

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:26.300
When you take down
these rabble‐rousers

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.966
like that lowly
Common, Shinji,

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.400
it makes my job
at Sector Security

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.700
that much easier.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.566
And I and all of the Tops
thank you for that.

00:04:35.566 --> 00:04:37.700
I don't know how we can
ever pay you back,

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.533
but I'm sure as friends,
we can find a way.

00:04:40.533 --> 00:04:41.600
Uh?

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.433
I see what's going on.

00:04:43.433 --> 00:04:45.733
You and Roget are
buddy‐buddy.

00:04:45.733 --> 00:04:47.333
You little rat!

00:04:47.333 --> 00:04:48.800
You're in Roget's pocket!

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:51.700
You were working for security
the whole time!

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.900
I could never figure
outwhy you were the one

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:55.866
who got pickedto
duel Jack.

00:04:55.866 --> 00:04:57.400
<i>Now I know‐‐it's because</i>

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.833
you and the Topsidersare
working together!

00:04:59.833 --> 00:05:01.366
That's not true!

00:05:01.366 --> 00:05:03.166
(all gasping)

00:05:03.166 --> 00:05:05.200
Folks, it sounds
like Shinji's saying

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.133
Yuya and Roget are
in cahoots!

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:10.200
This turn of events has
"scandal" written all over it.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.333
And that can't be good
for the Friendship Cup.

00:05:13.333 --> 00:05:15.000
You gotta believe me!

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.433
Why would I work with
someone who locked me up?

00:05:17.433 --> 00:05:19.033
I'd never
double‐cross you!

00:05:19.033 --> 00:05:21.333
I've always had your back,
and I always will!

00:05:21.333 --> 00:05:23.300
(man)
Save it,
you two‐faced liar!

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.766
How does someone duel
the Master of Faster,

00:05:25.766 --> 00:05:27.833
lose to him, and then
get to keep dueling

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:30.066
when all the other losers
are sent underground

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:32.300
to pick up trash for
the rest of their lives?

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:34.066
Don't sound right to me!

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:36.100
(gruff man)
When you're buddy‐buddy
with security,

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.833
anything's possible.

00:05:37.833 --> 00:05:39.233
(shrill man)
So what was it, Yuya?

00:05:39.233 --> 00:05:41.233
Security promise
they wouldn't

00:05:41.233 --> 00:05:43.033
send you underground
if you lose?

00:05:45.666 --> 00:05:48.100
You're working for them,
aren't you?

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.566
You lied to us,
all of us!

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:56.733
You lied to us,
all of us!

00:05:56.733 --> 00:05:58.333
You know
that can't be true!

00:05:58.333 --> 00:05:59.866
I'd never go
behind a friend's‐‐

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:02.800
Of course,
it isn't true.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:06.533
No one's working
for anyone, right?

00:06:06.533 --> 00:06:08.633
I chose Yuya
to battle Jack

00:06:08.633 --> 00:06:10.833
because I recognized
his potential.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:12.700
What's that
supposed to mean?

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.166
It's clear Yuya has
special gifts.

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:18.833
When this young man demonstrated
his Pendulum Summoning,

00:06:18.833 --> 00:06:22.100
an ability we previously
knew nothing about,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.566
I felt it was
important to discover

00:06:24.566 --> 00:06:27.300
just how powerful
it actually was.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.833
So, to find out,
I pitted him against Jack Atlas,

00:06:30.833 --> 00:06:33.033
our city's top duelist.

00:06:33.033 --> 00:06:36.600
As you know, despite
Yuya's considerable skills,

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:37.600
Jack won.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.266
But as a result
of that duel,

00:06:39.266 --> 00:06:40.966
my faith in Yuya Sakaki

00:06:40.966 --> 00:06:43.000
and his formidable
talent has grown.

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000
And continues to.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.133
His ability improves
with every battle.

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:51.200
You all witnessed him
successfully Synchro Summon

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:52.900
after Pendulum
Summoning,

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.266
proving he continues to evolve
and grow as a duelist.

00:06:56.266 --> 00:06:58.066
(cheering and applause)

00:06:58.066 --> 00:06:59.733
Listen, Yuya.

00:06:59.733 --> 00:07:03.166
They are the ones
who share my belief in you.

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:06.333
And I know they share
my wish for you.

00:07:06.333 --> 00:07:09.633
We want you to win
the Friendship Cup

00:07:09.633 --> 00:07:13.066
and face Jack Atlas
once more.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.000
Smile for the cameras,
superstar.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.533
Hey, wait a minute here,
I don't wanna‐‐

00:07:22.533 --> 00:07:24.566
(reporter)
So, highlighting
the latest developments,

00:07:24.566 --> 00:07:26.900
the newcomer
Yuya Sakaki has won

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.866
a dramatic,
come‐from‐behind victory

00:07:28.866 --> 00:07:30.433
over Common
Shinji Weber.

00:07:30.433 --> 00:07:32.000
<i>And, as you just heard‐‐</i>

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.466
Why is Roget
being so nice?

00:07:34.466 --> 00:07:36.366
It certainly
makes you wonder.

00:07:36.366 --> 00:07:39.633
It's as if he wants
something from the boy.

00:07:41.266 --> 00:07:44.700
Roget is trying
to sway his allegiance.

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.466
Yuya is not one to be easily
fooled, though.

00:07:47.466 --> 00:07:50.766
His loyalty lies
with the Lancers.

00:07:54.133 --> 00:07:56.300
Wait a sec‐‐ don't you
wanna hear from me, too?

00:07:56.300 --> 00:07:58.733
(thinking)
Yuya? Working
for the Topsiders?

00:07:58.733 --> 00:08:01.200
<i>It can't be true!</i>

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.433
I thought we were
on the same team.

00:08:03.433 --> 00:08:05.033
<i>I'm so stupid.</i>

00:08:05.033 --> 00:08:07.133
I never should've
told him about Jack.

00:08:07.133 --> 00:08:08.500
Never should've
trusted him.

00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:10.900
Never should've
given him that card.

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:13.133
If I could go back,
I would.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:16.000
I'd take that card
and just tear it up

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.266
<i>and never talk to Yuya.</i>

00:08:18.266 --> 00:08:19.666
<i>Wish I never met him.</i>

00:08:19.666 --> 00:08:21.133
He lied to me
and pretended

00:08:21.133 --> 00:08:22.833
<i>to be my friend.</i>

00:08:22.833 --> 00:08:25.566
But he's no better than
Jack‐‐ he's the worst!

00:08:27.166 --> 00:08:28.466
(growling)

00:08:28.466 --> 00:08:30.066
Save your praise.
I‐‐ huh?

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:31.566
All this yapping
you're doing

00:08:31.566 --> 00:08:32.766
is making me sick!

00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:34.966
You think Yuya's amazing.

00:08:34.966 --> 00:08:37.133
Well, I think it's amazing
how you fixed the duel

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:38.633
so he'd win.

00:08:38.633 --> 00:08:40.700
That's not true!

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.333
Burn my biscuits!

00:08:42.333 --> 00:08:44.500
Shinji's on
the warpath again!

00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.366
He's convinced
that Director Roget's

00:08:46.366 --> 00:08:48.300
up to some dirty
duel dealings!

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:49.733
As New Domino City's

00:08:49.733 --> 00:08:51.966
number one
investigative reporter,

00:08:51.966 --> 00:08:53.566
I'll get the inside scoop

00:08:53.566 --> 00:08:55.466
for all you
valued viewers out there!

00:08:55.466 --> 00:08:56.700
Let's hustle it up!

00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:58.966
Shinji, if I'm guilty
of fixing duels,

00:08:58.966 --> 00:09:01.566
you therefore must be
a full‐fledged traitor.

00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:03.033
And how's that?

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:05.200
It simply
stands to reason.

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.566
If you say the match
with Yuya is fixed,

00:09:07.566 --> 00:09:09.866
well, that means
you threw the duel.

00:09:09.866 --> 00:09:12.433
Did you lose
on purpose, Shinji?

00:09:12.433 --> 00:09:15.066
Was your rebellion
all a lie?

00:09:15.066 --> 00:09:17.733
Are you the traitor
to all the commons?

00:09:17.733 --> 00:09:21.566
We both know very well
you aren't a traitor, Shinji.

00:09:21.566 --> 00:09:24.466
You just can't face the fact
that you are a loser.

00:09:24.466 --> 00:09:27.133
And a sore one,
at that.

00:09:27.133 --> 00:09:30.466
When I get my hands on you,
you'll be the one who's sore.

00:09:30.466 --> 00:09:32.333
Remove him.

00:09:32.333 --> 00:09:35.466
There's only one place
garbage belongs.

00:09:35.466 --> 00:09:37.233
Underground.

00:09:37.233 --> 00:09:40.433
Ugh! Let me go!
This isn't over, Roget!

00:09:40.433 --> 00:09:42.533
And you're
the traitor, Yuya!

00:09:42.533 --> 00:09:44.200
(straining)

00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:46.233
Shinji! I didn't
want this to happen!

00:09:46.233 --> 00:09:47.900
You'll pay for this!

00:09:47.900 --> 00:09:49.700
I never trusted you
from the start!

00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.900
That's what I always told Crow,
and now he knows for sure!

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:54.800
Shinji, I'm gonna do
whatever it takes

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.266
to make this right.

00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:59.366
I never let
my friends down.

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.000
Never, and I'm not
starting now.

00:10:08.633 --> 00:10:10.100
Hey, let me go!

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:13.400
You don't understand,
I gotta find my friend!

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.000
She could be hurt
really badly!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.566
You heard
what he said.

00:10:22.133 --> 00:10:25.266
Hurry! Let's get
the lowdown on Yuya!

00:10:25.266 --> 00:10:26.633
Ah‐buh‐huh?

00:10:26.633 --> 00:10:29.366
Golly, I reckon
our lowdown just

00:10:29.366 --> 00:10:30.733
high‐tailed it
out of here.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.066
Roget just let Yuya go?

00:10:36.066 --> 00:10:38.833
That proves that they're
totally working together!

00:10:38.833 --> 00:10:42.333
(thinking)
I know it's a big city,
but I'm gonna find you, Zuzu.

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:45.366
And I know exactly
who's gonna help me do it.

00:10:45.366 --> 00:10:48.633
I just hope Sora's playing
for the good guys again.

00:10:55.433 --> 00:10:58.566
This is where
I saw Sora during my duel.

00:10:58.566 --> 00:11:00.333
He's gotta be here.

00:11:00.333 --> 00:11:02.166
Hey! Sora!

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:04.800
It's me, Yuya!

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.066
Come on out!

00:11:06.066 --> 00:11:07.766
Enough with
the hiding, Sora.

00:11:07.766 --> 00:11:09.266
Where are you?

00:11:09.266 --> 00:11:10.533
(thinking)
<i>Tsk, tsk, Yuya.</i>

00:11:10.533 --> 00:11:12.866
I wish you had eyes
on the back of your head.

00:11:12.866 --> 00:11:15.533
Then you'd realize that
you were being followed.

00:11:15.533 --> 00:11:18.933
Sora!
Come on out!

00:11:18.933 --> 00:11:20.566
I need your help!

00:11:20.566 --> 00:11:22.000
Sora!

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.966
(thinking)Seriously, Sora,
enough is enough.

00:11:24.966 --> 00:11:27.166
You gotta be near here‐‐
aah!

00:11:29.533 --> 00:11:31.100
Finally.
Shh!

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:32.533
They're tailing you.

00:11:32.533 --> 00:11:34.033
Come on.

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:35.366
Stick to the shadows.

00:11:35.366 --> 00:11:36.700
Where's Zuzu?

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.333
Is she here?
Is she all right?

00:11:38.333 --> 00:11:39.933
Keep your voice down!

00:11:39.933 --> 00:11:41.333
You found her helmet.

00:11:41.333 --> 00:11:43.133
Did you find
the rest of her?

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.433
Less talk,
more walk.

00:12:00.433 --> 00:12:02.500
(panting)

00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.166
Zuzu's okay.

00:12:04.166 --> 00:12:05.600
So just chill.

00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:07.633
I got her tucked away
safe and sound.

00:12:07.633 --> 00:12:10.433
So no need to lose
your cool or anything.

00:12:10.433 --> 00:12:12.633
Boy,
that's a relief.

00:12:12.633 --> 00:12:14.433
I'm so glad
you found her.

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.033
Thanks, Sora.

00:12:16.033 --> 00:12:18.033
I owe you big‐time.

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:20.700
But you know I...
I gotta admit,

00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.766
I can't believe
you're actually here.

00:12:22.766 --> 00:12:24.500
I was worried that
I'd never see you again.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:26.100
Yeah, about that...

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:28.233
You know...

00:12:28.233 --> 00:12:31.400
I was kind of worried
seeing you again, Yuya.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:34.200
It's not like we parted
on the best of terms.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.800
Uh‐huh, I remember.

00:12:37.966 --> 00:12:40.233
But I'm back, and...

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:44.100
I'm here to tell you that
nothing will ever be the same.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.266
Last time we talked,
you said some scary stuff

00:12:51.266 --> 00:12:53.300
like dueling's about
crushing your enemy.

00:12:53.300 --> 00:12:55.200
Yeah, I did.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.866
Because that's
what Duel Academy taught me.

00:12:57.866 --> 00:12:59.600
To use force.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:02.766
To conquer dimensions
by any means.

00:13:02.766 --> 00:13:05.166
So then, if you're here,

00:13:05.166 --> 00:13:08.533
does that mean Duel Academy's
gonna attack this dimension?

00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:09.900
That's not right.

00:13:09.900 --> 00:13:12.100
Are you going
to let them capture Zuzu?

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:14.500
Uhh‐‐ Zuzu ain't
going anywhere.

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.400
Well, they have done
stuff like this before.

00:13:17.400 --> 00:13:21.133
Dennis captured
Shay's sister, Lulu.

00:13:21.133 --> 00:13:22.733
Zuzu ain't
going anywhere.

00:13:22.733 --> 00:13:24.933
Not on my watch.

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:27.100
I've been looking
everywhere for Zuzu.

00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.500
And now that
I finally found her,

00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.700
I'll do anything
to keep her safe.

00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:32.666
Keep her safe?

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:33.866
<i>That's right.</i>

00:13:33.866 --> 00:13:36.500
You see, I was
out to capture Selene.

00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.266
When she showed up
with your friends,

00:13:38.266 --> 00:13:40.433
I knew Zuzu might be
in trouble.

00:13:40.433 --> 00:13:42.466
There wasn't
any time to waste.

00:13:42.466 --> 00:13:43.966
So I high‐tailed it
out of there

00:13:43.966 --> 00:13:45.600
<i>as fast as I could.</i>

00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.200
I knew it wasn't
cool to do,

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.200
<i>but I had no choice.</i>

00:13:49.200 --> 00:13:50.900
When I got back
to Duel Academy,

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:52.766
I started searching
right away.

00:13:52.766 --> 00:13:54.666
I know the place like
the back of my hand,

00:13:54.666 --> 00:13:56.266
so I knew
I could find her.

00:13:56.266 --> 00:13:57.700
I'm quick and quiet,

00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.700
so getting around unseen
wouldn't be too hard.

00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:02.600
<i>I looked everywhere.</i>

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:06.133
Inside, outside,
but still no Zuzu.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:07.800
I was running
out of places to look,

00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:10.200
and that's when
I heard the Professor.

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:12.400
(Professor)
So you failed
to capture Zuzu?

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.033
Disappointment does not
do justice to how I feel.

00:14:16.033 --> 00:14:18.000
That's when
I found out the truth.

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.866
The Professor didn't
just want Celina.

00:14:20.866 --> 00:14:23.766
<i>He wanted Zuzu too.</i>

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:25.633
But I don't understand.

00:14:25.633 --> 00:14:27.666
What's the Professor
trying to do?

00:14:27.666 --> 00:14:29.900
And what does he want
with Celina and Zuzu

00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:32.200
and all the others?

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.500
Look, I'm not gonna
drop it just because

00:14:34.500 --> 00:14:36.333
you're giving me
the silent treatment.

00:14:36.333 --> 00:14:38.900
I already told you
everything I know.

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:42.366
They told me our mission
was to bring Celina back.

00:14:42.366 --> 00:14:44.733
Duel Academy taught me
to follow orders,

00:14:44.733 --> 00:14:45.966
not question them.

00:14:45.966 --> 00:14:47.266
I never asked.

00:14:49.300 --> 00:14:51.033
It wouldn't've
made any difference

00:14:51.033 --> 00:14:52.533
if I did know.

00:14:52.533 --> 00:14:54.333
We have to obey
the Professor's orders,

00:14:54.333 --> 00:14:55.833
no matter what.

00:14:55.833 --> 00:14:58.900
That's the Duel Academy rule.

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.133
Once I knew Zuzu
wasn't at Duel Academy,

00:15:03.133 --> 00:15:04.666
I went back
to your dimension

00:15:04.666 --> 00:15:06.500
to complete my mission
to get Celina

00:15:06.500 --> 00:15:08.366
and hopefully
find Zuzu, too.

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:11.333
But when I got there,
it was too late.

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:13.466
I learned that
Celina and you Lancers

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:15.933
left for
another dimension.

00:15:19.133 --> 00:15:21.600
So you came to Synchro
looking for us?

00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.066
Yeah, when I heard
about the Friendship Cup,

00:15:24.066 --> 00:15:26.333
I figured I would
find you there.

00:15:26.333 --> 00:15:28.433
And that's when I heard
Dennis spill the beans

00:15:28.433 --> 00:15:30.266
<i>about being from Fusion.</i>

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:32.100
<i>His cover was blown.</i>

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:34.133
So I sent him back
to Duel Academy.

00:15:39.400 --> 00:15:41.133
Back to Duel Academy?

00:15:41.133 --> 00:15:43.866
But Dennis will tell them
that Zuzu and Celina are here.

00:15:43.866 --> 00:15:46.166
All I did was rip
the band‐aid off.

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:47.533
Huh?

00:15:47.533 --> 00:15:49.100
It's time
to face facts, Yuya.

00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.233
Obelisk Force
will be here soon.

00:15:51.233 --> 00:15:53.500
And they're coming
for Celina and Zuzu.

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:56.166
Stopping them is
going to be

00:15:56.166 --> 00:15:58.033
next to impossible.

00:15:58.033 --> 00:16:00.633
They've already failed
the Professor once.

00:16:00.633 --> 00:16:03.166
They're not gonna
risk his wrath again.

00:16:03.166 --> 00:16:06.433
They won't stop
till Zuzu is theirs.

00:16:06.433 --> 00:16:08.266
But I'm willing
to disobey the Professor

00:16:08.266 --> 00:16:10.566
<i>because Zuzu's my friend.</i>

00:16:10.566 --> 00:16:13.300
I know that she would
do anything for me,

00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:16.400
so I'm gonna do anything
and everything in my power

00:16:16.400 --> 00:16:18.533
to keep Zuzu
out of their hands.

00:16:18.533 --> 00:16:20.333
You're serious?

00:16:20.333 --> 00:16:22.566
Zuzu is my...

00:16:22.566 --> 00:16:25.133
my bestest bud.

00:16:25.133 --> 00:16:26.933
At Duel Academy,

00:16:26.933 --> 00:16:28.233
I had classmates,

00:16:28.233 --> 00:16:30.533
but I don't know
if I had any friends.

00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:32.500
There was
no time for that.

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:34.566
If you wanted to be
the best of the best,

00:16:34.566 --> 00:16:36.500
you had to be cold
and calculating,

00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.466
<i>and I was.</i>

00:16:38.466 --> 00:16:40.800
But then when
I met you and Zuzu,

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.933
I felt like I finally
had my first real friends.

00:16:43.933 --> 00:16:45.933
Sora...

00:16:45.933 --> 00:16:47.766
That's why I can't
let them get her.

00:16:47.766 --> 00:16:49.600
I won't
let them get her!

00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:52.233
Because once Zuzu's
locked up in Duel Academy,

00:16:52.233 --> 00:16:54.066
no one ever escapes.

00:16:55.266 --> 00:16:57.700
I've got it
all figured out, Yuya.

00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.533
I have Zuzu
in a safe place.

00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:01.266
All you have to do
is go get Celina

00:17:01.266 --> 00:17:02.466
and bring her to me.

00:17:02.466 --> 00:17:04.000
Sora,
why would I do that?

00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.100
So that we can
make a trade.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.900
You hand Celina
over to me,

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.533
then you take
Zuzu back home.

00:17:10.533 --> 00:17:12.600
I can't just
abandon Celina.

00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:13.800
What's the big deal?

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.400
Look, Yuya,
Duel Academy's

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.566
where Celina
originally came from,

00:17:17.566 --> 00:17:19.500
and I'm just bringing her
to where she belongs.

00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.700
No, I'm not doing it, Sora.

00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.900
I'm not letting
anybody go there.

00:17:24.900 --> 00:17:27.266
Not Celina, not Zuzu,

00:17:27.266 --> 00:17:29.566
and I'm gonna get
Lulu out of there too!

00:17:29.566 --> 00:17:32.733
(over radio)The Professor's not
getting his way!

00:17:32.733 --> 00:17:34.900
My, my, my.

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.866
How very interesting.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.166
So Duel Academy is
about to attack this city,

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:45.633
and I have no doubt
they'll send Yuri.

00:17:45.633 --> 00:17:47.633
And wherever Yuri goes,

00:17:47.633 --> 00:17:50.500
incalculable
destruction follows.

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:52.366
I want Yuya
and the boy with him

00:17:52.366 --> 00:17:53.766
brought to me
immediately.

00:17:53.766 --> 00:17:56.466
I will interrogate
them both myself.

00:17:56.466 --> 00:17:58.600
They will lead us
straight to Zuzu.

00:17:58.600 --> 00:18:01.100
Or suffer
the consequences.

00:18:05.233 --> 00:18:07.066
You have to face
the facts, Yuya.

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:08.933
I didn't want
to involve Celina,

00:18:08.933 --> 00:18:10.933
but there's no other way
to save Zuzu.

00:18:10.933 --> 00:18:12.266
Get her out now.

00:18:12.266 --> 00:18:13.633
Obelisk Force is coming,

00:18:13.633 --> 00:18:15.700
and they'll tear this place
apart till they find her.

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:17.500
And if I take
Zuzu back home,

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:19.900
Obelisk Force is gonna
come looking for her there.

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.700
That means they'll tear
my home apart, too.

00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:25.066
And all my friends
could get hurt.

00:18:27.866 --> 00:18:30.133
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

00:18:30.133 --> 00:18:31.500
If you don't
want that to happen,

00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:34.266
let me take Celina back
and talk to the Professor.

00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:36.133
Do you really believe
he'll listen to anything

00:18:36.133 --> 00:18:37.733
you or anybody else
has to say?

00:18:37.733 --> 00:18:39.300
Uh...

00:18:40.833 --> 00:18:43.333
Duel Academy's
gotta be defeated.

00:18:43.333 --> 00:18:46.400
And if you join us,
I know we can stop them.

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:49.100
It's the only way
we can keep everyone safe.

00:18:49.100 --> 00:18:50.500
Uh?

00:18:51.700 --> 00:18:52.733
Look out!

00:18:54.266 --> 00:18:55.566
Yuya!

00:18:55.566 --> 00:18:57.000
Get out of here!

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.933
Take care
of Zuzu for me!

00:19:03.900 --> 00:19:06.233
I'm counting on you, Sora.

00:19:11.533 --> 00:19:12.866
This is so weird.

00:19:12.866 --> 00:19:14.433
Where am I?

00:19:14.433 --> 00:19:15.800
The last thing
I remember,

00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:17.200
I was dueling.

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.200
Then... nothing,
it's a total blank.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.866
Are you okay?

00:19:24.266 --> 00:19:26.066
Hey, look,
it's the girl

00:19:26.066 --> 00:19:28.133
who wiped out
in the Friendship Cup.

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:29.500
(gasping)

00:19:29.500 --> 00:19:31.000
Wow, you look
pretty good for someone

00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.966
who destroyed a skyscraper,
blew up a runner,

00:19:32.966 --> 00:19:35.700
and fell
about 40 stories.

00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.033
It was that bad, huh?

00:19:38.033 --> 00:19:40.166
(Terron)
No, it was way worse.

00:19:40.166 --> 00:19:42.300
So then...

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:44.300
I guess
it's safe to assume

00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:46.133
I didn't win the duel, huh?

00:19:46.133 --> 00:19:47.500
Yeah,
it's pretty safe.

00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:48.833
So, like,
when you were backstage,

00:19:48.833 --> 00:19:50.766
did you run
into Crow or Yuya?

00:19:50.766 --> 00:19:51.866
Huh?

00:19:51.866 --> 00:19:53.733
You guys know Yuya?

00:19:53.733 --> 00:19:56.333
You betcha‐‐
we're B. F. F.'s!

00:19:56.333 --> 00:19:57.833
He stayed with us
and Crow.

00:19:57.833 --> 00:19:59.566
He snored a lot.

00:19:59.566 --> 00:20:03.233
Oh, wait, maybe it was
that other girl.

00:20:03.233 --> 00:20:04.833
She made the roof shake.

00:20:04.833 --> 00:20:06.533
Kept us up all night.

00:20:06.533 --> 00:20:08.533
But it wasn't
too bad.

00:20:08.533 --> 00:20:11.033
So, like, was it super‐cool
being in the Friendship Cup

00:20:11.033 --> 00:20:13.066
and dueling in front
of millions of people?

00:20:13.066 --> 00:20:15.133
I guess it was okay.

00:20:15.133 --> 00:20:16.700
Until I got blasted
off the track

00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:18.000
and lost my duel.

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.466
(Frankie)
Come on, guys,
we gotta hurry.

00:20:20.466 --> 00:20:23.400
You don't wanna miss the start
of Crow's next duel, do you?

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:26.300
So, hey, you wanna come
with us and cheer for Crow?

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.600
Well, I...

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.466
The only thing is
we can't go see him

00:20:29.466 --> 00:20:31.866
at the Duel Palace 'cause
we kinda got kicked out

00:20:31.866 --> 00:20:33.733
by security last time
we sneaked in.

00:20:33.733 --> 00:20:35.666
But don't you
worry about that.

00:20:35.666 --> 00:20:38.100
We have our own secret place
to see the duels from.

00:20:38.100 --> 00:20:40.766
Yeah, and it's a place
where security can't find us.

00:20:40.766 --> 00:20:42.833
Come on!
Let's go!

00:20:42.833 --> 00:20:45.300
Slow down!
Last time I went this fast,

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:47.500
I nearly took
a building down.

00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:54.000
(thinking)
If Shinji's right,
then Yuya is a traitor.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:57.066
So that means all the Lancers
are traitors,

00:20:57.066 --> 00:20:58.633
including
my next opponent.

00:20:58.633 --> 00:21:02.000
I've gotta take them down
one by one.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.200
And then I'll take down
the ultimate traitor.

00:21:04.200 --> 00:21:06.133
<i>Jack Atlas.</i>

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:11.033
(thinking)
Dennis can't be
the only one.

00:21:11.033 --> 00:21:13.433
There must be others
from Duel Academy

00:21:13.433 --> 00:21:15.666
that've infiltrated
this dimension.

00:21:15.666 --> 00:21:18.666
<i>I can't trust anybody.</i>

00:21:18.666 --> 00:21:20.633
<i>I have to treat them all</i>

00:21:20.633 --> 00:21:22.466
<i>like the enemy.</i>

00:21:22.466 --> 00:21:25.800
(Melissa)
