00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:04.233
(Yuya)
Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:06.100
(Melissa)
Hope you're ready...

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.600
because we are about to begin

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.733
the second day of dueling
in the Friendship Cup!

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.266
And to kick things off,

00:00:12.266 --> 00:00:15.300
it'll be Officer 227
of the Duel Chaser Division

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.733
versus Yuya Sakaki!

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:19.833
You all need to know
something!

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:23.200
When a duelist loses, they're
sent away to the underground

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.433
where they're forced
into hard labor!

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:26.533
Huh?

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:27.600
What?

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
And once they're there,
they stay there,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.533
cleaning up trash
against their will

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:33.033
for the rest of their lives!

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:34.633
So naiïve.

00:00:34.633 --> 00:00:37.166
You ain't from here,
are ya?

00:00:37.166 --> 00:00:39.400
This is life
in the big city!

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.000
Am I right, y'all?

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.300
(cheering)

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.100
You mean you're all okay
with this?

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.200
You bet!

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.266
Let's Duel!

00:00:48.766 --> 00:00:51.166
I guess my dueltaining will have
to change their minds.

00:00:51.166 --> 00:00:53.366
(laughing)

00:00:53.366 --> 00:00:58.233
Introducing Odd‐Eyes
Saber Dragon!

00:00:58.233 --> 00:01:01.566
Attack Jutte Lord
with all of your might!

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:08.033
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon,
attack 227 directly!

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:15.366
(Melissa)
And we have our winner!

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.133
Yuya...

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:18.900
(Melissa)
Congratulations, Yuya!
Huh?

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.033
Just listen to that crowd.
They absolutely adore you!

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:24.266
(Yuya)
Wait, stop!

00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:26.100
Don't do it!

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.000
Don't take him
to the underground!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.233
It's wrong!

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:31.466
You're making a mistake!

that dueling is
about having fun.

00:02:45.566 --> 00:02:48.233
But in the end, the whole city
still thinks

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:51.100
sending someone
to the underground is okay.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.633
<i>All righty, folks!</i>

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:55.166
Two more duelists
are about to dance,

00:02:55.166 --> 00:02:58.266
with Yugo taking on
Sylvio Sawatari!

00:02:58.266 --> 00:02:59.600
Sylvio?

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.833
That means more R&amp;R for me.

00:03:03.633 --> 00:03:06.733
Once again, cast aside
like a soggy sandwich!

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:09.566
How come Sylvio gets to duel
instead of me?

00:03:09.566 --> 00:03:12.266
Huh?
Huh?

00:03:12.266 --> 00:03:14.366
Syl‐vi‐o...

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:15.766
I'm finally up!

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.566
It was starting to feel like
they'd never call my name!

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:22.966
I'm totally revved up
for this party!

00:03:22.966 --> 00:03:24.500
This is for Rin Rin.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.166
You and I both had a dream‐‐

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:28.666
to one day duel
in the Friendship Cup.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.433
And today that dream is
coming true!

00:03:32.633 --> 00:03:36.033
Okay, I'm primed
and ready to go supersonic

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:37.833
and leave the competition
in the dust!

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:41.700
(Melissa)
It's time to say howdy‐doo
to our duelists!

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.100
Give 'em an earful of
cheerful as they blast onto the
field!

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.033
And the first to take
to the track is Yugo!

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:55.100
Followed by
Sylvio Sawatari!

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.300
The great dueltainer!

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.266
For anyone who wants
an autograph,

00:03:59.266 --> 00:04:01.933
meet me in the winner's circle
after the duel!

00:04:01.933 --> 00:04:04.133
(crowd booing)
(man) Sylvio?

00:04:04.133 --> 00:04:07.100
More like Sylvi‐no!
(booing)

00:04:10.433 --> 00:04:11.900
Yugo's up.

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:16.400
(crowd cheering)

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.866
This crowd is already
charged up,

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:21.933
and I haven't even
beaten you yet!

00:04:21.933 --> 00:04:25.766
I can feel their adulation
coursing through my whole body!

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.666
Don't go spoiling my moment
by losing too quickly!

00:04:28.666 --> 00:04:31.466
No need to worry,
'cause I won't lose.

00:04:31.466 --> 00:04:33.266
Our duel begins...

00:04:33.266 --> 00:04:34.366
now!

00:04:34.366 --> 00:04:37.733
So fire up...
the Action Field...

00:04:37.733 --> 00:04:40.200
Crossover Acceleration!

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.766
(computer)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:43.200
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:50.833
(Melissa)
<i>On your marks...</i>

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:52.800
<i>get set...</i>

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.900
<i>Go!</i>

00:04:55.733 --> 00:04:57.300
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.900
(Yugo)
Need a manual?

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.333
I'm fine!

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:08.566
(Melissa)
<i>Hoo‐wee!</i>

00:05:08.566 --> 00:05:10.233
That's some fancy
freeform drivin'!

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:13.466
Fancy and fast enough to earn
him the right to go first!

00:05:13.466 --> 00:05:16.166
Hey, not bad
for a first‐timer, huh?

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:17.700
Not too good either.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:19.633
Oh, really?

00:05:19.633 --> 00:05:20.900
Check this!

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.100
I'm going for gold
with my very first move!

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.333
I'll use my Scale 3
Abyss Actor Extras...

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:28.933
and my Scale 8 Abyss Actor
Funky Comedian

00:05:28.933 --> 00:05:30.600
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.100
Okay, actors!

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:33.600
Take your places, please!

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.600
Now, I can summon monsters
between Level 4 and 7

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.433
all at the same time!

00:05:38.433 --> 00:05:39.933
I Pendulum Summon!

00:05:39.933 --> 00:05:42.533
Now meet some of my other
cast members!

00:05:42.533 --> 00:05:45.166
Monsters, emerge!

00:05:45.166 --> 00:05:48.566
Like the talented
Abyss Actor Superstar!

00:05:48.566 --> 00:05:53.266
And the unpredictable Abyss
Actor Sassy Rookie!

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.800
(Melissa)
Sylvio's one of those
dueltainer types,

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.766
and it looks like
his entertaining ways

00:05:57.766 --> 00:06:00.133
have turned the crowd's
jeers into cheers!

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:02.833
Pulling out all
the stops, I see.

00:06:02.833 --> 00:06:04.866
That was just
the warm‐up act.

00:06:04.866 --> 00:06:10.066
Superstar's special ability
lets me get Abyss Script
Opening Ceremony!

00:06:10.066 --> 00:06:12.233
Ha!

00:06:12.233 --> 00:06:15.166
And it will serve
as your closing ceremony!

00:06:15.166 --> 00:06:17.100
Attention one and all!

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.700
This spell ups
my life points by 500

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:22.166
for each Abyss Actor
in attack mode!

00:06:22.166 --> 00:06:25.766
This is how I roll, bold and
brash, with plenty of flash!

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:37.400
And the best is yet to come!

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.233
(crowd cheering)

00:06:40.466 --> 00:06:42.333
I dare you to try
and top that!

00:06:42.333 --> 00:06:44.133
Challenge accepted!

00:06:44.133 --> 00:06:46.000
You're going down!

00:06:51.333 --> 00:06:52.866
You're going down!

00:06:58.333 --> 00:06:59.600
Sylvio...

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.533
When there's no other monsters
on my field,

00:07:01.533 --> 00:07:03.233
I can summon this.

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:05.300
Speedroid Terrortop!

00:07:08.366 --> 00:07:10.566
And when I have Terrortop
on the field,

00:07:10.566 --> 00:07:14.900
I'm also allowed to bring out
Speedroid Taketomborg!

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:15.966
Hiya!

00:07:19.566 --> 00:07:21.366
But I'm not done yet.

00:07:21.366 --> 00:07:25.166
Next, I'll roll out
the Tuner Monster...

00:07:25.166 --> 00:07:27.366
Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice!

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.000
I tune Level 1 Red‐Eyed Dice

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.166
with Level 3 Terrortop
and Taketomborg!

00:07:37.166 --> 00:07:39.533
Here goes!

00:07:39.533 --> 00:07:42.500
This duel is about to take off
in a big way!

00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:45.200
Get set for a monster
that will beat its wings

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.433
and whip up a whirlwind
of destruction...

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:54.533
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:54.533 --> 00:07:57.166
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:02.266
(Melissa)
<i>Jumping Jiminy!</i>

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:04.900
Yugo just Synchro Summoned
in record time!

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.800
That Dragon's
awful powerful

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.800
and it looks like it's got
a nasty temper, too!

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.333
A dragon...

00:08:13.333 --> 00:08:15.200
This should be fun!

00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.500
Destroying Dragons is
my favorite hobby!

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.600
I've never done it
while riding a Duel Runner,

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.200
but that will simply add
to the drama!

00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:24.666
Hurry up and end
your turn so I can attack!

00:08:24.666 --> 00:08:26.733
You'll have to wait for me
to attack first!

00:08:26.733 --> 00:08:29.133
Clear Wing,
take out Sassy Rookie

00:08:29.133 --> 00:08:31.166
with Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:36.366
Rookie, do your thing!

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:39.300
Shield yourself
and deflect that blast!

00:08:44.233 --> 00:08:47.300
Your monster may be safe,
but your life points aren't!

00:08:49.433 --> 00:08:51.600
That's enough fun
for one turn!

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.233
Back to you, Sylvio!

00:08:54.433 --> 00:08:55.866
(Melissa)
<i>What a duel!</i>

00:08:55.866 --> 00:08:57.766
Just look at how Yugo
and Sylvio

00:08:57.766 --> 00:08:59.300
are jostling
for position!

00:09:01.300 --> 00:09:03.233
What's going on,
Odd‐Eyes?

00:09:03.233 --> 00:09:05.133
Why are you glowing?

00:09:06.933 --> 00:09:09.300
It's my turn once again!

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.500
Ha‐ha‐ha!

00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:12.333
You damaged me
a little just now,

00:09:12.333 --> 00:09:14.533
but that setback only makes
things more interesting.

00:09:14.533 --> 00:09:16.533
As long as I'm able
to Pendulum Summon,

00:09:16.533 --> 00:09:19.500
there's no way you can't
stop me from winning.

00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.666
That's not gonna happen,

00:09:21.666 --> 00:09:25.733
'cause I activate the trap
Dragon's Bind!

00:09:25.733 --> 00:09:28.766
You're no longer allowed
to Pendulum Summon any monster

00:09:28.766 --> 00:09:32.066
that has less attack points than
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon.

00:09:32.066 --> 00:09:34.833
So if you planned
to Pendulum Summon a monster

00:09:34.833 --> 00:09:37.833
with 2,500 attack points
or less, you're out of luck!

00:09:37.833 --> 00:09:39.233
Oh, no!

00:09:39.233 --> 00:09:41.900
Your deck's basically
on lockdown!

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.166
And if you're thinking
of attacking my Dragon,

00:09:44.166 --> 00:09:47.166
Follow Wing will make you
think twice!

00:09:47.166 --> 00:09:50.466
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
can't be destroyed in battle!

00:09:50.466 --> 00:09:53.400
Plus, when a Level 5‐or‐above
monster attacks it,

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.200
that monster will be destroyed

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.700
and then my Clear Wing gets
all of its attack points!

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.566
So if the only thing attacking
does is hurt me,

00:10:01.566 --> 00:10:02.933
thanks but no thanks!

00:10:02.933 --> 00:10:04.333
I'm outta here!

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:06.633
You can run,
but you can't hide!

00:10:06.633 --> 00:10:08.533
Sooner or later,
I'll catch up!

00:10:08.533 --> 00:10:12.166
(Sylvio)
People, the Sylvio Show is
far from over!

00:10:12.166 --> 00:10:14.466
Even though I can't
Pendulum Summon,

00:10:14.466 --> 00:10:18.100
I'll summon my monsters to
the stage the old‐fashioned
way!

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:22.533
Please give a warm welcome to
my Abyss Actor Leading Lady!

00:10:28.866 --> 00:10:31.166
Did you summon that monster
to battle my Dragon

00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:32.700
or to go trick‐or‐treating?

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.200
Your Leading Lady won't be
able to destroy my Clear Wing.

00:10:36.200 --> 00:10:37.766
Then it's a good thing
I know a way

00:10:37.766 --> 00:10:39.466
to make
your Clear Wing disappear

00:10:39.466 --> 00:10:41.433
without destroying it
in combat!

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:44.100
I just have to tap into
Superstar's special ability

00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:47.166
so I can get the spell
Abyss Script Fantasy Magic!

00:10:47.166 --> 00:10:49.900
That will send your Dragon
back to your hand!

00:10:52.533 --> 00:10:55.566
The world's greatest
dueltainer is ready to strike!

00:10:55.566 --> 00:10:58.266
I activate Superstar's
special ability!

00:10:58.266 --> 00:10:59.966
It doesn't matter what you do

00:10:59.966 --> 00:11:02.166
thanks to my Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:06.000
When your monster
that's Level 5‐or‐above
activates its special ability,

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.300
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon
not only stops it,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.666
but your monster is
also destroyed!

00:11:10.666 --> 00:11:12.100
Reverse Revenge!

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:20.100
Aw, great!

00:11:20.100 --> 00:11:21.900
If you want to get rid
of Clear Wing,

00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:24.666
you've got to be more clever
than that, Sylvi‐no!

00:11:24.666 --> 00:11:28.000
My Dragon has more talent than
any Monster in your whole deck!

00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:32.600
If I win, Sylvio will be forced

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.833
to work
in the underground refinery.

00:11:34.833 --> 00:11:36.333
(gasps)

00:11:36.333 --> 00:11:37.800
If I win?

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:40.633
Ugh.
Still plenty of duel left!

00:11:40.633 --> 00:11:43.666
I activate the spell
Abyss Prop Wild Wagon!

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:44.766
Ha!

00:11:46.133 --> 00:11:47.833
(horses neighing)

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:50.400
Time for my monsters
to hit the trail!

00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:53.000
'Cause everyone knows
there's nothing more dramatic

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.900
than a chase!

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.100
Whoa!

00:11:56.100 --> 00:11:58.400
Sylvio's Monsters are making
a break for it!

00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.933
They won't get far!

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:15.800
(Melissa)
The excitement is building,
folks!

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.266
Sylvio's monsters are bolting
down the track

00:12:18.266 --> 00:12:20.466
like a pair of
rabid coyotes!

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:23.833
But Clear Wing's determined
to cut 'em off at the
pass!

00:12:23.833 --> 00:12:25.633
Quit running scared!

00:12:25.633 --> 00:12:27.300
Stage fright
got you?

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:28.833
Me, scared?
Get real!

00:12:28.833 --> 00:12:30.366
I'm making the most
of the moment

00:12:30.366 --> 00:12:32.000
so this crowd gets
their money's worth!

00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.966
(Sylvio)
I end my turn!

00:12:33.966 --> 00:12:38.333
With the end of your turn, Clear
Wing's ability wears off!

00:12:38.333 --> 00:12:40.366
So its attack points
return to normal!

00:12:40.366 --> 00:12:42.400
My turn!
Hiya!

00:12:42.400 --> 00:12:45.266
All right, Clear Wing,
go and attack!

00:12:45.266 --> 00:12:47.633
Take out his Leading Lady!

00:12:51.233 --> 00:12:54.866
Fortunately, my Wagon comes
with built‐in defenses!

00:12:54.866 --> 00:12:58.633
Since my Leading Lady hitched a
ride, she's won't be
destroyed!

00:13:03.133 --> 00:13:05.433
Oh, she's safe,
but you're sure not!

00:13:05.433 --> 00:13:07.266
You still take damage!

00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:11.066
In this case,
I don't mind taking damage,

00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:14.200
'cause now, my Leading Lady
can use her special ability!

00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.333
She works her witchcraft to chip
away at your Dragon's
strength!

00:13:18.333 --> 00:13:20.600
And your Clear Wing
loses attack points

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.533
equal to the damage
that I took.

00:13:22.533 --> 00:13:25.100
That little sorceress
is full of surprises!

00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.266
She's got a wand and she is
not afraid to wield it!

00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:31.666
That's what you get

00:13:31.666 --> 00:13:33.766
for selling the world's
greatest dueltainer short!

00:13:33.766 --> 00:13:35.033
Here goes!

00:13:35.033 --> 00:13:37.733
Leading Lady, do you thing!

00:13:37.733 --> 00:13:40.200
Clear Wing's special ability
activates!

00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:42.200
Destroying your Leading Lady!

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:44.433
My Wagon has more surprises
for you!

00:13:44.433 --> 00:13:47.966
It protects my Leading Lady
from any spells, traps,

00:13:47.966 --> 00:13:50.933
or special abilities that
you activate during this turn,

00:13:50.933 --> 00:13:54.966
leaving her free to keep
working her magic!

00:13:54.966 --> 00:13:56.366
(gasping)

00:13:56.366 --> 00:13:58.633
Weakening your Clear Wing
gives me an added advantage,

00:13:58.633 --> 00:14:01.166
'cause your Dragon's Bind
trap will be weaker, too!

00:14:01.166 --> 00:14:03.266
Now I can Pendulum Summon
monsters

00:14:03.266 --> 00:14:07.400
with more than 1,500
attack points instead of 2,500!

00:14:07.400 --> 00:14:10.266
While you were busy coasting,
we were going into overdrive!

00:14:10.266 --> 00:14:13.100
(Melissa)
That Sylvio is one
clever cowboy!

00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.300
For a minute there, he
looked like buzzard food,

00:14:15.300 --> 00:14:18.233
but he just turned the tables
on Yugo lickety‐split!

00:14:18.233 --> 00:14:19.833
Yugo...

00:14:19.833 --> 00:14:23.033
You don't know when to quit,
do you, Sylvio?

00:14:23.033 --> 00:14:26.566
In fact, that's something
we both have in common!

00:14:26.566 --> 00:14:28.266
(both)
It's your turn!

00:14:28.266 --> 00:14:32.233
That last series of moves was so
amazing I even impressed myself,

00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:34.100
but that's nothing compared
to the grand finale

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:35.466
I've planned for you!

00:14:35.466 --> 00:14:37.333
Let me show you!

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:39.900
Since I already set
my Pendulum Scale...

00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:41.300
I Pendulum Summon!

00:14:41.300 --> 00:14:46.533
Superstar, I'm calling on you
for an encore performance!

00:14:46.533 --> 00:14:47.866
(Melissa)
<i>Bravo!</i>

00:14:47.866 --> 00:14:50.700
That there's some
crackerjack card play!

00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:53.533
Next, Funky Comedian will
get into the act

00:14:53.533 --> 00:14:55.866
by using its Pendulum ability!

00:14:55.866 --> 00:14:58.766
By sending Abyss Actor Superstar
back to my Extra Deck,

00:14:58.766 --> 00:15:02.566
Abyss Actor Sassy Rookie gains
Superstar's attack points.

00:15:05.366 --> 00:15:07.166
All righty, Rookie!

00:15:07.166 --> 00:15:08.900
Attack Clear Wing pronto!

00:15:16.066 --> 00:15:17.300
(Melissa)
<i>Jeepers!</i>

00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:19.966
Yugo just took a heap‐load
of damage!

00:15:19.966 --> 00:15:22.333
My Leading Lady
will join in the fun, too!

00:15:22.333 --> 00:15:24.000
By wielding her special ability,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:28.033
she can clear out all
of Clear Wing's attack points!

00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:29.800
(Melissa)
<i>Zero attack points?</i>

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:33.333
That Lady just turned
Yugo's Dragon into a
pussycat!

00:15:33.333 --> 00:15:34.900
Sensational!

00:15:34.900 --> 00:15:38.400
Once my Leading Lady attacks
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,

00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:40.066
you, sir, will lose the duel!

00:15:40.066 --> 00:15:43.433
(Melissa)
Uh‐oh, it looks like
the jig is up for Yugo!

00:15:43.433 --> 00:15:46.233
Leading Lady,
this is your big moment!

00:15:46.233 --> 00:15:48.833
Attack and win me this duel!

00:15:53.100 --> 00:15:54.900
(Sylvio)
It's over, Yugo!

00:15:56.033 --> 00:15:57.333
It's an Action Card!

00:16:00.900 --> 00:16:01.966
(gasps)

00:16:01.966 --> 00:16:04.366
(Melissa)
<i>Will it be enough?</i>

00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:07.033
I'm activating Miracle!

00:16:07.033 --> 00:16:08.866
Not only does this Action Spell

00:16:08.866 --> 00:16:10.666
save my Clear Wing
from being destroyed,

00:16:10.666 --> 00:16:13.000
it cuts the damage I take
in half!

00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:19.133
Yugo's still in this match!

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:23.233
If there's one thing
I can't stand,

00:16:23.233 --> 00:16:25.466
it's a duelist
who hogs the spotlight,

00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:27.900
especially when I'm trying
to hog it!

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:31.766
I've left you
too weak to win, though!

00:16:31.766 --> 00:16:34.866
(Melissa)
Yugo's life points are
running on fumes!

00:16:34.866 --> 00:16:38.600
Does he have anything left in
the tank to stage a
comeback?

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.266
Here goes!

00:16:40.266 --> 00:16:42.700
If I don't get the card I need
on this next draw,

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:43.866
it's all over.

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.466
Excellent!

00:16:51.466 --> 00:16:53.966
Now I've got a road map
to victory!

00:16:55.333 --> 00:16:58.600
I'm summoning
Speedroid Double Yoyo!

00:16:58.600 --> 00:16:59.566
Yah!

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:03.800
And its special ability
lets me summon

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.000
another Speedroid
from my graveyard,

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.266
so welcome back to the battle,
Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice!

00:17:12.766 --> 00:17:14.800
You're going
to Synchro Summon?

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.866
Even if you succeed,
it'll be too little too late!

00:17:17.866 --> 00:17:22.366
My Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice tunes
my Speedroid Double Yoyo!

00:17:22.366 --> 00:17:23.633
Yah!

00:17:29.666 --> 00:17:31.900
By merging the best
of both monsters,

00:17:31.900 --> 00:17:33.533
I'm about to go supersonic

00:17:33.533 --> 00:17:36.033
and break every speed barrier
that exists!

00:17:36.033 --> 00:17:38.600
I Synchro Summon!

00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:41.833
Hit the accelerator,
Hi‐Speedroid Hagoita!

00:17:46.933 --> 00:17:50.500
By tributing Hagoita...

00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:53.800
all the monsters on the field
gain a special ability!

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:55.866
(both gasping)

00:17:55.866 --> 00:17:57.333
Did you say all of them?

00:17:57.333 --> 00:17:58.900
That's right!

00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:00.366
So from here on out,

00:18:00.366 --> 00:18:02.000
whenever a monster's
level changes,

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.966
those monster's gain
one additional level.

00:18:04.966 --> 00:18:07.066
Ha!
All that trouble,

00:18:07.066 --> 00:18:09.266
for something not very useful,
I'm afraid.

00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:11.933
You should be afraid,
Sylvio!

00:18:11.933 --> 00:18:15.266
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:18:15.266 --> 00:18:16.500
Huh?
(gasps)

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:23.066
I activate the spell
Hi‐Speed Re‐Level!

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:26.266
I'm kicking this duel
into high gear!

00:18:26.266 --> 00:18:28.800
By banishing Hagoita
from my graveyard,

00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:31.933
all our monsters change
to match its Level!

00:18:31.933 --> 00:18:34.566
So all the monsters on the field
are Level 5!

00:18:34.566 --> 00:18:37.133
And now,
thanks to Hagoita's ability,

00:18:37.133 --> 00:18:39.466
all our monsters gain one level!

00:18:42.166 --> 00:18:44.433
I am so not digging
this plot twist!

00:18:44.433 --> 00:18:47.333
Now you can activate
Clear Wing's ability.

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:48.766
That's right!

00:18:48.766 --> 00:18:51.400
A special ability
that will take you down!

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:53.500
So it all comes down to this!

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:57.133
Since your Leading Lady
and Sassy Rookie are now
above Level 5,

00:18:57.133 --> 00:18:59.800
my Dragon can now send them
to the showers!

00:19:03.666 --> 00:19:05.833
Clear Wing now gains
the attack points

00:19:05.833 --> 00:19:08.033
of the monsters
that were just destroyed,

00:19:08.033 --> 00:19:10.433
making it strong enough
to finish you off!

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:16.133
Clear Wing, take flight
and finish off this fight!

00:19:22.433 --> 00:19:23.533
Huh?!

00:19:28.233 --> 00:19:30.733
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:19:34.566 --> 00:19:36.433
(grunting)

00:19:37.733 --> 00:19:39.133
(Melissa)
<i>Yee‐haw!</i>

00:19:39.133 --> 00:19:40.800
<i>What a duel!</i>

00:19:40.800 --> 00:19:42.766
Those boys had
my head spinning

00:19:42.766 --> 00:19:44.933
like an out‐of‐control
merry‐go‐round!

00:19:44.933 --> 00:19:48.866
But in the end, Yugo pulled
off one doozy of a win!

00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:52.800
Huh?

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.633
(thinking)
What happened?

00:19:55.633 --> 00:19:56.766
It's like I was dueling.

00:19:56.766 --> 00:20:00.366
I aced this duel
and now it's on to round two!

00:20:00.366 --> 00:20:03.200
I just wish Rin Rin could have
seen me win.

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:05.133
There were a couple
of times there

00:20:05.133 --> 00:20:09.533
where I wasn't sure
if I was watching Yugo or Yuya.

00:20:09.533 --> 00:20:12.900
I was so close to winning,
I could taste it!

00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:14.833
(growls)

00:20:14.833 --> 00:20:16.533
(man)
That was funtastic, Sylvio,

00:20:16.533 --> 00:20:18.333
but the fun's over now!

00:20:18.333 --> 00:20:19.666
(woman)
Sorry to see you go!

00:20:19.666 --> 00:20:21.966
(man 2)
Yeah, your dueltaining
style rocks!

00:20:21.966 --> 00:20:24.200
Too bad I'll never see
you duel again!

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:25.400
(women)
We love you!

00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:26.800
(crowd cheering)

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:28.466
(Melissa)
Sylvio may have been
the runner‐up,

00:20:28.466 --> 00:20:31.200
but it sounds like
he won this crowd over!

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.333
Huh?

00:20:32.333 --> 00:20:34.233
(Sylvia)
Yugo!
Huh?

00:20:34.233 --> 00:20:36.066
Don't you hear
that cheering?

00:20:36.066 --> 00:20:38.000
We brought these fans
to their feet!

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:39.900
Give 'em a little
love back!

00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:42.533
Get off that runner
and take a bow!

00:20:42.533 --> 00:20:45.366
Huh?
You know, it's strange.

00:20:45.366 --> 00:20:48.700
I didn't notice before,
but you look a lot like Yuya.

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:50.433
Huh?

00:20:50.433 --> 00:20:52.366
You're not the first
to say that.

00:20:52.366 --> 00:20:54.333
In fact, I would say...

00:20:54.333 --> 00:20:56.700
the two of you look
exactly alike.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:58.133
Why is that?

00:20:59.766 --> 00:21:01.633
You made it close, superstar.

00:21:01.633 --> 00:21:03.100
But not quite
close enough.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.500
Now come along.
Show's over.

00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.500
Wait, come along where?

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:08.600
Let me go!

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.400
Remove your hands!

00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:13.133
This ensemble is expensive!

00:21:13.133 --> 00:21:15.566
No.
