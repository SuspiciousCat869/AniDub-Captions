WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:02.966
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.900
(Melissa)
We've now entered
the second round

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.900
and only eight
duelists remain!

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.600
Who among 'em
will advance?

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:13.400
Today's first
match up will be...

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.466
Zuzu Boyle versus
Sergey Volkov!

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.600
(Jean Michael Roget)Listen
carefully, Sergey...

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.933
Zuzu is an essentialpiece
to my ultimate plan‐‐

00:00:23.933 --> 00:00:26.700
you are to defeat herby
any means necessary

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.433
<i>and bring her to me...</i>

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.966
<i>in one piece.</i>

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.700
Let's duel!
Duel!

00:00:39.933 --> 00:00:41.100
(Zuzu)
You're hurt!

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.866
(Jean Michael Roget)
His vitals
are spiking.

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:44.066
Focus.

00:00:44.066 --> 00:00:46.733
I think that we
oughta pause this duel.

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:48.966
We have an injured
duelist here!

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:50.000
Mercy...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.966
worry...

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:52.366
concern...

00:00:52.366 --> 00:00:56.066
all signs
of weakness.

00:00:56.066 --> 00:00:59.033
And like all who
are weak...

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.633
They must
be destroyed!

00:01:03.066 --> 00:01:04.400
(alarm blaring)

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.466
This is what I
was afraid of...

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.666
I just hope he doesn't
go too far.

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.433
I need her unscathed.

00:01:13.433 --> 00:01:14.833
Zuzu!

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.966
(Melissa)
In a shocking
turn of events,

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:28.066
Sergey Volkov has
taken the "W."

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:32.333
Zuzu's a fighter folks, but
until we learn otherwise,

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.400
she may be down for
the count.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.800

Sergey Volkov has just
re‐entered the stadium!

00:02:49.933 --> 00:02:52.566
Our winner took an incredible
amount of punishment

00:02:52.566 --> 00:02:55.666
and certainly dished
some out‐‐ maybe too much!

00:02:55.666 --> 00:02:56.933
(laughing)

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.533
She's done!

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:00.833
She's history!

00:03:00.833 --> 00:03:03.400
That look of terror on
the little mouse's face

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.433
was beautiful!

00:03:05.433 --> 00:03:07.733
(laughing)

00:03:07.733 --> 00:03:09.733
Beautiful!

00:03:09.733 --> 00:03:12.000
That Sergey's something else!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.133
He doesn't just
beat his opponents.

00:03:14.133 --> 00:03:15.866
He destroys them.

00:03:15.866 --> 00:03:18.166
He's frightening.

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:22.166
♪

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:24.100
Declan this is most
disappointing.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.766
You assured us
that your Lancer's

00:03:25.766 --> 00:03:27.666
were the best of
the best.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:32.200
(Gray)
But it appears once again,
your best has been bested.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.733
(Azul)
What do you have to
say for yourself?

00:03:35.733 --> 00:03:38.466
(Boldo)
Your silence on this
matter speaks volumes.

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:42.033
How can your Lancers win a war
when they can't even win a duel?

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:45.266
(laughing)

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.500
Security is heading
towards Sergey!

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.833
(laughing)

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.766
(Melissa)They've gone
an' hogtied 'em!

00:03:59.766 --> 00:04:02.566
And now they're escortingout
of the stadium.

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:05.633
If an easy duel like
that causes him to break down,

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:08.500
Sergey needs some
fine tuning.

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:10.200
But what
about Zuzu?

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.400
Zuzu...

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:12.733
Zuzu!

00:04:19.933 --> 00:04:21.233
Zuzu.

00:04:21.233 --> 00:04:22.366
No!

00:04:22.366 --> 00:04:24.233
I can't
think the worst.

00:04:24.233 --> 00:04:26.033
She's going to
be ok.

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:26.966
I just know it!

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.100
Open up!

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.166
Let me out!

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:35.400
We're moving up to
the next matchup...

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.166
Shinji Weber vs
Yuya Sakaki!

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:39.166
(gasps)

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.000
(beeping)

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:47.833
It's your
turn, Yuya.

00:04:47.833 --> 00:04:49.233
Sam, Zuzu!

00:04:49.233 --> 00:04:50.966
How is she?

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:52.033
I don't know.

00:04:52.033 --> 00:04:53.933
Someone's got
to go help her!

00:04:53.933 --> 00:04:56.266
(Shinji)
It's no use,
Yuya.

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:58.033
Shinji.

00:04:58.033 --> 00:05:00.833
Zuzu lost her duel so
she doesn't matter to them.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.966
We're nothing but toys
for the Topsiders

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:05.633
and when we break
they throw us away.

00:05:05.633 --> 00:05:09.033
As far as they're
concerned, she's trash.

00:05:09.033 --> 00:05:11.233
That can't be!

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:12.366
They can't leave
her there.

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:13.766
What if
she's hurt!

00:05:13.766 --> 00:05:15.633
They don't care what
happens to her.

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:17.600
And they don't care
what happens to you.

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.066
(gasps)

00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:20.466
That's why I'm fighting.

00:05:20.466 --> 00:05:23.833
To change this rotten
society once and for all!

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:26.233
I'm tired of being
treated like an animal

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:29.833
by this stinking mess
they call a City!

00:05:29.833 --> 00:05:30.966
I've had enough!

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:32.900
I'm going to force
them to change!

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.966
I'm going to lead the Commons
in a rebellion to take the power

00:05:35.966 --> 00:05:39.866
that's rightfully ours and
overthrow the Topsiders!

00:05:39.866 --> 00:05:43.266
And I can't lead the people
if I'm sent to the underground.

00:05:43.266 --> 00:05:45.900
So beating you is
the only possible way

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:47.833
that I can keep
fighting!

00:05:47.833 --> 00:05:50.033
I don't care about
dueling you right now!

00:05:50.033 --> 00:05:51.533
All I can think
about is Zuzu

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:53.833
and how I can get
to her to help her.

00:05:53.833 --> 00:05:55.633
Who knows how badly
she's hurt.

00:05:55.633 --> 00:05:56.800
Zuzu needs me!

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.566
I just know it!

00:05:58.566 --> 00:06:01.000
Zuzu's way more
important than dueling!

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.600
Dueling might be
the only way to save her.

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:05.800
You think you can just
walk on outta here?

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:07.266
Keep dreamin'!

00:06:07.266 --> 00:06:08.566
You want to
help your friend?

00:06:08.566 --> 00:06:11.066
Then get on your
runner and ride.

00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:13.566
Maybe you can do something
for her out there,

00:06:13.566 --> 00:06:17.800
but there's nothing you can
do for her locked up in here.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.733
Hope to see you at
the starting line.

00:06:19.733 --> 00:06:21.300
I'm sure Zuzu
does to.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:30.800
The second
matchup of Day Two

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.133
of the Friendship Cup's
about to start!

00:06:33.133 --> 00:06:37.233

Hang on, Zuzu.

00:06:44.866 --> 00:06:46.200

but so far there's
no trace of her.

00:06:55.500 --> 00:06:57.366
(Jean Michael Roget)
After that impact
there's no way

00:06:57.366 --> 00:07:00.066

It's time to turn your
anger into action!

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.154
Let it fuel our fight
to set ourselves free

00:08:28.154 --> 00:08:30.087
from the Topsiders
tyranny!

00:08:30.087 --> 00:08:31.720
<i>I will win this duel...</i>

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.854
and together, we'll
win this fight!

00:08:33.854 --> 00:08:36.254
<i>Fight with me!</i>

00:08:36.254 --> 00:08:37.987
It's our turn!

00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:40.954
I summon Battlewasp
Pin The Bullseye!

00:08:44.454 --> 00:08:46.920
Shinji's monster
is bee‐utiful...

00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:49.420
But it's only
got 200 attack points!

00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:52.987
After all his big talk he
leads with that puny thing.

00:08:52.987 --> 00:08:55.820
His rebellion's off to
a very weak start.

00:08:55.820 --> 00:08:57.587
I'm beginning this
duel with a monster

00:08:57.587 --> 00:08:59.620
that's only got 200
attack points

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.754
because it's a
lot like we are!

00:09:01.754 --> 00:09:04.987
By itself, it has almostno
power to do anything.

00:09:04.987 --> 00:09:07.087
And on our own, we
don't have the power

00:09:07.087 --> 00:09:09.187
to do very much
ofanything either.

00:09:09.187 --> 00:09:12.287
But if weak monsters unite
andfight together they can
win,

00:09:12.287 --> 00:09:14.520
and if we all fight
together we have the power

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:16.887
to overturn this unjust
society...

00:09:16.887 --> 00:09:19.120
And we can
be winners, too!

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:21.154
(murmuring)

00:09:21.154 --> 00:09:23.620
I activate its
special ability...

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:29.454
once per turn, Pin The Bullseye
can deal 200 points of damage.

00:09:29.454 --> 00:09:31.020
(groans)

00:09:32.587 --> 00:09:35.887
I play a facedown
and end my turn.

00:09:35.887 --> 00:09:38.587
After a "rebel"‐rousing
start, Shinji stepped up

00:09:38.587 --> 00:09:40.320
and finally dealt
some damage.

00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:41.754
But with justone
weak monster,

00:09:41.754 --> 00:09:43.220
Shinji'll have
topull some tricks

00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:44.887
out of hissaddlebag
to win!

00:09:44.887 --> 00:09:47.654
I know the monster I've
got isn't very strong.

00:09:47.654 --> 00:09:50.687
But with the power of tens of
thousands of Commons behind us,

00:09:50.687 --> 00:09:52.087
we can't lose!

00:09:52.087 --> 00:09:54.054
Together we
can do this!

00:09:54.054 --> 00:09:56.220
Let's get this
rebellion started!

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:58.720
(murmuring)

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.120
(Yuya)
How's he gonna start anything
with 200 attack points?

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:03.554
My turn!

00:10:03.554 --> 00:10:05.020
I'm taking the sting
out of your bee

00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:09.154
by setting the Pendulum Scale
with Scale 2 Performapal Gongato

00:10:09.154 --> 00:10:12.220
and Scale 6 Performapal
Extra Slinger!

00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.587
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:10:15.587 --> 00:10:18.787
♪

00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.087
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 3 through 5

00:10:24.087 --> 00:10:26.220
all at the same time!

00:10:26.220 --> 00:10:27.854
Swing far,
Pendulum!

00:10:27.854 --> 00:10:30.120
Carve the arc
of victory!

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:34.320
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:37.387
Come on out Performapal
Silver Claw...

00:10:37.387 --> 00:10:40.887
and Performapal
Salutiger!

00:10:40.887 --> 00:10:44.087
(Melissa)
Yuya's pulled off a
perfect Pendulum Summon!

00:10:44.087 --> 00:10:45.587
And now,
I'm activating

00:10:45.587 --> 00:10:48.520
the power producing
spell card Gap Power!

00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.687
If you've got more life
points than I do,

00:10:50.687 --> 00:10:52.554
one of my monsters
gains attack points

00:10:52.554 --> 00:10:54.720
equal to half
the difference!

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:57.287
Really?

00:10:57.287 --> 00:11:00.354
The difference between
our life points is 200.

00:11:00.354 --> 00:11:02.354
So I think I'm going
to give my Silver Claw

00:11:02.354 --> 00:11:04.054
a little something
to howl about.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:07.387
I can't believe
you'd waste a spell

00:11:07.387 --> 00:11:09.987
just to get a measly hundred
attack points.

00:11:09.987 --> 00:11:13.954
When my Silver Claw goes after
Pin The Bullseye you'll see.

00:11:13.954 --> 00:11:16.554
When Silver Claw attacks,
its special ability

00:11:16.554 --> 00:11:20.054
gives every Performapal
300 extra attack points

00:11:20.054 --> 00:11:21.820
till the end
of my turn!

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:25.954
Added all up, that's a total of
4200 attack points between them!

00:11:25.954 --> 00:11:28.954
With back‐to‐back attacks,
I'll put you away!

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:32.720
This has the makings
of one‐turn win for Yuya!

00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:39.387
With back‐to‐back attacks,
I'll put you away!

00:11:39.387 --> 00:11:42.454
This has the makings
of a one‐turn win for Yuya!

00:11:42.454 --> 00:11:45.087
Oh, the fun of
one and done.

00:11:45.087 --> 00:11:47.720
He'll put that bigmouth
Shinji in his place.

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.654
Come on, Shinji!

00:11:49.654 --> 00:11:50.754
Silver Claw...

00:11:50.754 --> 00:11:52.054
attack!

00:11:52.054 --> 00:11:53.987
Things may not
work as you planned.

00:11:53.987 --> 00:11:57.854
I activate the trap
Battlewasp Nest!

00:11:57.854 --> 00:12:00.454
It lets me summon a
second Pin The Bullseye

00:12:00.454 --> 00:12:02.487
and stop your attack.

00:12:02.487 --> 00:12:05.387
Only bad thing is‐‐ I can
only use this awesome effect

00:12:05.387 --> 00:12:07.420
twice during
the duel.

00:12:12.387 --> 00:12:14.854
It looks to me like
you and your Silver Claw

00:12:14.854 --> 00:12:17.054
bit off more than
you can chew!

00:12:17.054 --> 00:12:18.254
(Melissa)
Hot digity!

00:12:18.254 --> 00:12:20.787
Shinji not only picked up
an extra monster,

00:12:20.787 --> 00:12:23.020
but he just
ended Yuya's attack!

00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:24.720
(cheering, murmuring)

00:12:28.187 --> 00:12:31.520
Since my attack ended,
Silver Claw's ability ends too

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.887
so my pals
power down!

00:12:35.454 --> 00:12:36.887
You've got to
do better...

00:12:36.887 --> 00:12:38.720
if you thought winning
would be that easy

00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:40.787
you're in for
a rude awakening.

00:12:40.787 --> 00:12:43.687
(Yuya)
The only one in for
a rude awakening is you.

00:12:43.687 --> 00:12:45.387
You only have two
weak monsters.

00:12:45.387 --> 00:12:47.754
I can handle this.

00:12:47.754 --> 00:12:49.520
I end my turn!

00:12:51.687 --> 00:12:52.887
C'mon, Yuya.

00:12:52.887 --> 00:12:54.254
I know you're worried
about Zuzu,

00:12:54.254 --> 00:12:55.754
but keep your
head in the game.

00:12:59.387 --> 00:13:00.754
My turn!

00:13:00.754 --> 00:13:04.387
I summon the Tuner Monster
Battlewasp Sting The Poison!

00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.520
I'm able to summon
this wicked wasp

00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:12.387
directly from my hand by
negating its special abilities.

00:13:12.387 --> 00:13:15.154
Come on out, Battlewasp

It'll be tough
to tangle with!

00:13:41.787 --> 00:13:44.820
Just like me and
my fellow Commons!

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.220

We're with you all the way,

We just want
what's right!

00:13:58.787 --> 00:14:01.087

Shinji's just turned
this duel upside down

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:19.554
by summoning a super‐strong
Synchro Monster!

00:14:19.554 --> 00:14:21.254

How am I
gonna beat it?

There he is.

This fight

doubling the damage caused

00:14:44.687 --> 00:14:46.754
Twice as much damage!

Here's only a fraction of

A card that's sure
to bring down our enemy!

00:16:02.087 --> 00:16:05.354
By sending Battlewasp Dart
The Hunter to the graveyard,

00:16:05.354 --> 00:16:07.320
you take damage equal
to the attack points

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.620
of all the monsters
that were destroyed in battle.

00:16:09.620 --> 00:16:11.187
No way!

Plus, that
damage is doubled

thanks to Azusa The Ghost Bow's
special ability!

00:16:16.287 --> 00:16:19.620
My Salutiger had
1700 attack points.

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:21.054
Correct, Yuya.

00:16:21.054 --> 00:16:24.120

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:54.754
If it's not too late.

00:17:58.654 --> 00:18:00.154
This duel's done for!

00:18:00.154 --> 00:18:01.654
(gasping)

00:18:07.354 --> 00:18:08.687
This duel's done for!

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:10.854
(gasping)

00:18:13.887 --> 00:18:18.420
I activate Acceleration‐
negating your special ability!

00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:19.687
Aw man...

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:22.820
Yuya's still
standing!

00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:23.820
(gasping)

00:18:27.354 --> 00:18:29.787
You lucked out with
that Action Spell, Yuya.

00:18:29.787 --> 00:18:32.454
But luck won't be
able to stop this.

00:18:32.454 --> 00:18:35.854
The rebellion is so much
bigger than either of us.

00:18:35.854 --> 00:18:37.354
Your turn.

00:18:37.354 --> 00:18:40.154
(Yuya)
Maybe this City isn't fair,
but inciting a riot

00:18:40.154 --> 00:18:41.720
isn't the answer.

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:43.487
That's not
what I duel for.

00:18:43.487 --> 00:18:45.787
That's not what
Zuzu duels for.

00:18:49.587 --> 00:18:52.554
I know we want to get home
to our friends and family,

00:18:52.554 --> 00:18:55.220
and I promise you we'll
see them soon Zuzu,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:57.954
but first we have to
stop this war from happening

00:18:57.954 --> 00:18:59.420
and fix this City.

00:18:59.420 --> 00:19:01.654
I swear it, Zuzu!

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:09.287
My monster
is ready...

00:19:09.287 --> 00:19:12.820
to swing into
action!

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.920
It's go time,
Timebreaker Magician!

00:19:17.354 --> 00:19:18.620
(Melissa)
<i>Mercy me!</i>

00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:19.654
Yuya just
Pendulum Summoned,

00:19:19.654 --> 00:19:23.154
but he only summoned
one monster!

00:19:23.154 --> 00:19:26.254
I activate Timebreaker
Magician's special ability!

00:19:26.254 --> 00:19:29.487
Since I chose to only Pendulum
Summon this one monster,

00:19:29.487 --> 00:19:32.354
Timebreaker's
attack points are doubled

00:19:32.354 --> 00:19:34.454
That's 2800
attack points.

00:19:34.454 --> 00:19:37.854
Timebreaker Magician attack
Azusa The Ghost Bow!

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.520
Your turn Silver Claw,
attack Pin The Bullseye!

00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:51.887
When Silver Claw attacks,
its special ability

00:19:51.887 --> 00:19:55.187
gives it an extra 300
attack point power up!

00:19:57.187 --> 00:20:01.054
Battlewasp Nest's effect
summons another Pin The Bullseye

00:20:01.054 --> 00:20:03.320
and stops you from attacking
for the rest of the turn!

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.654
(Melissa)
There goes Shinji stonewalling
Yuya's attack again!

00:20:09.654 --> 00:20:12.254
But that's the second time
you used that effect,

00:20:12.254 --> 00:20:15.287
so your Battlewasp Nest
is destroyed!

00:20:15.287 --> 00:20:18.754
Now you can't stop any of
my attacks anymore, Shinji!

00:20:18.754 --> 00:20:20.420
I end my turn.

00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:21.654
(Yuya)
but before you
know it,

00:20:21.654 --> 00:20:23.320
I'll be
ending this duel!

00:20:23.320 --> 00:20:25.820
Sounds like Yuya's
back in this.

00:20:33.487 --> 00:20:36.287
That was a pretty clever
move you made, Yuya...

00:20:36.287 --> 00:20:38.520
but you're not just
fighting me now!

00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:41.054
I've got thousands‐‐hundreds
of thousands

00:20:41.054 --> 00:20:43.287
<i>of Commons on my side!</i>

00:20:43.287 --> 00:20:47.020
We're finally standing upfor
justice‐‐ for freedom!

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:48.720
<i>And no onecan stop us!</i>

00:20:54.687 --> 00:20:56.487
It's our turn!

00:20:56.487 --> 00:20:58.354
Sorry, Shinji.

00:20:58.354 --> 00:21:00.287
but I'm gonna
win this duel.

00:21:00.287 --> 00:21:01.987
