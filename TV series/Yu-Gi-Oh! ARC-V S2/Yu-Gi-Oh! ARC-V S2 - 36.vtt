WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:03.766
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:03.766 --> 00:00:07.766
What do you you say
we start up the final match
of the second round?

00:00:07.766 --> 00:00:08.933
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:08.933 --> 00:00:10.433
Dear Celina.

00:00:10.433 --> 00:00:12.600
It's imperative
you win this match.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.033
I'll assist as best I can.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:17.333
Patch me into
the course control grid

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.200
and be on standby.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.733
I Synchro Summon!

00:00:20.733 --> 00:00:23.066
Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle!

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.300
Now go!

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.133
Yugo's making his move.

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:28.333
If this attack connects,

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.933
Celina will be
completely defenseless.

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:34.366
Adjust course point
Delta five to Gamma ten.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.033
(computer)
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:38.933
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.933
Aah!

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.066
Oh, man, this is
gonna be close!

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.366
Ha. How unexpected.

00:00:49.366 --> 00:00:51.400
Roget's constant interfering

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.433
has made this duel
more entertaining!

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:56.366
I Fusion Summon!

00:00:56.366 --> 00:01:01.733
Lunalight Panther Dancer
is on the prowl!

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.366
Attack Hi‐Speedroid Puzzle

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.200
and shred the rest of Yugo's
life points!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.966
I Synchro Summon!

00:01:07.966 --> 00:01:11.366
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:12.733
(roaring)

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:19.166
(roaring)

00:01:19.166 --> 00:01:20.533
(whimpering)

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:26.833
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon?

00:01:26.833 --> 00:01:28.633
Time to end this!

00:01:29.966 --> 00:01:31.266
Here I go!

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:33.100

(Melissa, on P. A.)This has been
one hot humdinger of a duel!

00:02:50.666 --> 00:02:53.300
Like when Yugo was about to grab
an Action Card

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.400
only to have the course change
on him at the last second!

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.800
But he came back
and summoned

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.733
his big ol' Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:02:59.733 --> 00:03:01.733
to get the upper hand
against Celina!

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:04.033
Question is, can he keep it?

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:06.866
Ha ha!
What a duel!

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:09.100
I mean, is this
the best or what, huh?

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.233
Hey, Rin, don't you agree?

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:13.700
My name's not Rin!

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.366
Oh, yeah! Sorry!

00:03:15.366 --> 00:03:16.433
(Celina)
And another thing:

00:03:16.433 --> 00:03:18.600
You think that dumb dragon's
gonna help you?

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.500
The toughest monster on the
field is still hanging with me,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.333
although she's about to groove
on over and pay you a visit!

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:27.900
Now, Panther Dancer!

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.300
Attack Clear Wing!

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.166
Don't think so, Celina!

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.033
You may have a kitten
in your corner,

00:03:34.033 --> 00:03:36.300
but I've got luck on my side!

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:40.266
I activate the trap
Dicetadium of Fate!

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.866
I roll one die, and if an even
number comes out,

00:03:44.866 --> 00:03:48.233
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon gains
1,000 attack points!

00:03:48.233 --> 00:03:51.133
But if I roll an odd number,
it gets destroyed.

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:54.266
So you're counting on chance to
save you again, huh?

00:03:54.266 --> 00:03:56.833
Fine, then.
Go right ahead.

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:58.966
It all comes down to this.

00:03:58.966 --> 00:04:00.500
Come on even!
Go!

00:04:03.566 --> 00:04:06.000
It's a six!
Yugo did it!

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.533
Clear Wing's attack points
increase!

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:12.133
And my chances of winning
decreased.

00:04:12.133 --> 00:04:16.300
(Melissa, on P. A.)
This makes Yugo's monster the
heaviest hitter on the field!

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:20.666
So when Panther Dancer
attacks, Celina takes
damage!

00:04:21.733 --> 00:04:23.800
I thought Yugo was through.

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.400
But, boy, was I wrong.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.133
What a duel!

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:30.166
It's been fun, but it's
about to get funner.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.933
For me, that is.

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:35.433
(thinking)
Yugo's got
the upper hand now.

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:37.933
Yugo, you little pest.

00:04:37.933 --> 00:04:40.600
When will you learn that you
will not walk away the victor?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:45.000
Adjust course point X‐Ray Tango
44 to Gulf‐Gulf six.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.866
(computer)
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:04:46.866 --> 00:04:49.800
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.466
The course is changing again?
Uhh!

00:04:52.466 --> 00:04:56.229
And it will lead Yugo down
a one‐way street to defeat.

00:05:01.044 --> 00:05:02.844
(computer)
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.077
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:05:05.077 --> 00:05:07.744
The course is changing again?
Uhh!

00:05:07.744 --> 00:05:11.610
And it will lead Yugo down
a one‐way street to defeat.

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:16.144
(Melissa, on P. A.)Celina better
muster up a move right quick!

00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:17.977
(Celina)
An action card.

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.277
(Melissa)
That Celina sure has got
scoopin' down pat!

00:05:23.277 --> 00:05:25.777
Boy, every time
you get in a jam,

00:05:25.777 --> 00:05:28.044
it seems as though the course
changes.

00:05:28.044 --> 00:05:30.744
And so does my advantage!

00:05:30.744 --> 00:05:32.344
Hey, it's cool!

00:05:32.344 --> 00:05:34.777
It's just for someone who
doesn't count on luck,

00:05:34.777 --> 00:05:36.844
you've had some lucky breaks!

00:05:38.344 --> 00:05:40.144
I play my Action Card.

00:05:40.144 --> 00:05:43.110
So get ready for...
Miracle!

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:46.310
Not only does it save my
Panther Dancer from being
destroyed,

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:49.744
it cuts the damage
I take in half.

00:05:49.744 --> 00:05:52.477
Uhh!

00:05:52.477 --> 00:05:55.477
Hmm. Excellent.

00:05:55.477 --> 00:05:58.210
Well played.
I guess the duel goes on.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.644
And goes on with Clear Wing's
points back to normal.

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:05.677
(Topsider)
Celina's dueling is quite
splendid!

00:06:05.677 --> 00:06:08.110
You totally rock, Celina!

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.310
You're the bomb!

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:13.577
This duel's playin' out
like a game of hot
potata'.

00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:14.977
First Celina
had the edge,

00:06:14.977 --> 00:06:17.077
<i>then Yugo yanked it away,</i>

00:06:17.077 --> 00:06:19.110
then Celina yanked it back,
then‐‐

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.044
<i>Oh, I can't keep track!</i>

00:06:21.044 --> 00:06:25.177
Next, I place one card
face down and end my turn.

00:06:25.177 --> 00:06:27.210
For now, that is.

00:06:30.744 --> 00:06:33.744
You say I had some
lucky breaks, Yugo?

00:06:33.744 --> 00:06:35.944
Well, you've had your share
as well.

00:06:35.944 --> 00:06:37.144
That's true.

00:06:37.144 --> 00:06:38.610
But yours are different.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:39.810
Huh?

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:41.877
My luck's been random.

00:06:41.877 --> 00:06:45.010
Your luck feels like there's
something more behind it.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.010
(scoffs)

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:49.010
(Yugo)
But I'm not making excuses.

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.977
After all, I'm still
gonna win.

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:52.777
And win big!

00:06:52.777 --> 00:06:55.510
I draw!
Here goes! Uhh!

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:57.010
All right!

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:58.410
I'm gonna summon...

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:00.910
Speedroid Pachingo‐Kart!

00:07:03.477 --> 00:07:05.544
And it's gonna
drive you crazy

00:07:05.544 --> 00:07:10.077
because it automatically
destroys one of your monsters.

00:07:10.077 --> 00:07:12.844
Bye‐bye, Panther Dancer!

00:07:12.844 --> 00:07:14.410
Afraid not.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.110
Panther Dancer
can't be destroyed

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.877
by any special abilities.

00:07:19.977 --> 00:07:22.077
You sure about that, Celina?

00:07:22.077 --> 00:07:24.177
'Cause my dragon's got
a different opinion.

00:07:24.177 --> 00:07:27.344
What?
Go do your thing, Clear Wing!

00:07:27.344 --> 00:07:29.777
Hyah!
(roaring)

00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:32.610
(roaring)

00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:35.544
When a monster activates
its special ability,

00:07:35.544 --> 00:07:38.410
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon not
only stops it,

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:43.010
but that monster is also
destroyed!

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:45.577
So heading straight to
the scrap heap is...

00:07:45.577 --> 00:07:47.277
Pachingo‐Kart.

00:07:49.977 --> 00:07:52.910
Why...
Why destroy my own monster?

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.944
Because now Clear wing gains
Pachingo‐Kart's

00:07:55.944 --> 00:07:59.477
1,800 attack points,
that's why!

00:07:59.477 --> 00:08:02.277
It has 4,300
attack points?

00:08:02.277 --> 00:08:04.177
Yugo's not skipping
a beat.

00:08:04.177 --> 00:08:07.577
He's got an answer for
everything Celina throws at him.

00:08:07.577 --> 00:08:09.677
And now...
Here I go.

00:08:09.677 --> 00:08:13.144
(both)
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon,
attack!

00:08:13.144 --> 00:08:15.610
(roaring)

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:20.277
Adjust course point X‐Ray Gulf
21 to Bravo 11.

00:08:20.277 --> 00:08:22.210
(computer)
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.544
<i>Course change initiated.</i>

00:08:23.544 --> 00:08:25.710
Well, what do you know?

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:26.944
(thinking)
Could Yugo be right?

00:08:29.744 --> 00:08:31.577
There, my dear.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:32.977
You're set up.

00:08:32.977 --> 00:08:35.110
Take this new path
and you'll find

00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.110
that a useful Action Card is
waiting for you.

00:08:44.877 --> 00:08:45.744
Huh?

00:08:50.877 --> 00:08:54.444
What in tarnation?! Celina
didn't pick up the Action
Card,

00:08:54.444 --> 00:08:57.177
so she couldn't do anything
to stop Yugo's attack.

00:08:57.177 --> 00:09:00.077
Unbelievable.
What is she thinking?

00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:05.477
I don't need luck to win,
random or otherwise.

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:08.110
(Yugo)
Are you out of your mind?

00:09:08.110 --> 00:09:11.377
No one said you need it,
but if it's there, take it!

00:09:11.377 --> 00:09:14.110
Dueling's all about
seizing the opportunity.

00:09:14.110 --> 00:09:15.544
That's how I duel,

00:09:15.544 --> 00:09:18.544
which is why after you passed
that Action Card, I grabbed it!

00:09:18.544 --> 00:09:20.310
But of course you did.

00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.277
Come on, it was
too good to pass up.

00:09:23.277 --> 00:09:26.010
So I did it.

00:09:26.010 --> 00:09:28.644
It doesn't matter,
I'll still beat you.

00:09:28.644 --> 00:09:30.277
And I'll do it my way.

00:09:30.277 --> 00:09:31.510
(Celina)
<i>The right way.</i>

00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:33.244
<i>With skills and strategy.</i>

00:09:33.244 --> 00:09:35.744
So good luck with
your Action Cards.

00:09:35.744 --> 00:09:38.744
Luck's what you believe in
most, after all.

00:09:38.744 --> 00:09:41.410
Oh, you're right about that,
but only partly.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:44.677
Because luck is just one part
of what I really believe in.

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.610
<i>Having fun in a duel!</i>

00:09:46.610 --> 00:09:49.144
(Melissa)
Oh, my! What a war
of words!

00:09:49.144 --> 00:09:51.044
But I have a feeling
it'll be nothing

00:09:51.044 --> 00:09:54.277
compared to the war of
monsters were about to see, duel
fans.

00:09:54.277 --> 00:09:56.277
And who knows what other
surprises

00:09:56.277 --> 00:09:59.910
might be just around
the bend!

00:10:03.677 --> 00:10:05.677
♪

00:10:07.477 --> 00:10:11.510
You made some good moves, Yugo,
but not as good as this.

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.010
I activate Lunalight
Reincarnation Dance,

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:17.177
and it's gonna shift things
my way!

00:10:17.177 --> 00:10:19.677
'Cause it adds two Lunalight's
to my hand!

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:23.010
I see what you're doing.

00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:24.877
You're planning to
Pendulum summon!

00:10:24.877 --> 00:10:27.744
Right! And you should
plan to lose.

00:10:29.277 --> 00:10:30.544
We'll see about that.

00:10:30.544 --> 00:10:32.277
I'll end things with
a facedown!

00:10:32.277 --> 00:10:35.677
And that means Clear Wing's
special ability ends

00:10:35.677 --> 00:10:38.710
and its attack points
return to normal.

00:10:40.644 --> 00:10:42.710
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>What a round that was!</i>

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.810
And this crowd can't seem
to get enough!

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.144
I never did hear a stadium
so full of

00:10:47.144 --> 00:10:49.277
hootin' and hollerin'
duel fanatics

00:10:49.277 --> 00:10:51.010
<i>as this one right here!</i>

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.310
And it seems split right down
the middle.

00:10:53.310 --> 00:10:55.110
Half the crowd is cheering
for Celina,

00:10:55.110 --> 00:10:57.477
while the other half
is rooting Yugo on!

00:10:57.477 --> 00:11:00.544
But don't take my word
for it, just listen!

00:11:00.544 --> 00:11:02.677
Celina!
Yugo!

00:11:02.677 --> 00:11:05.344
Celina!
Yugo!

00:11:05.344 --> 00:11:07.344
(thinking)
Are they rooting for us?

00:11:07.344 --> 00:11:09.110
I can't believe it.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.310
This is unreal.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:12.677
(crowd cheering)

00:11:25.544 --> 00:11:27.510
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>These fans won't quit!</i>

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.110
And I'm sure not gonna
make 'em!

00:11:29.110 --> 00:11:31.410
Otherwise they might start
yelling at me!

00:11:31.410 --> 00:11:33.744
Just listen to 'em, Celina!

00:11:33.744 --> 00:11:35.010
They want more!

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:38.510
So what do you say
we give 'em just that?!

00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:40.110
You're on.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.710
(thinking)
This is so great!

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.077
It's what dueling's
all about!

00:11:43.077 --> 00:11:45.310
(thinking)
It's so weird.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.577
All I cared about
was winning this duel.

00:11:47.577 --> 00:11:50.744
But now, I'm actually
having a fun time.

00:11:50.744 --> 00:11:52.377
Who would have thought?

00:11:52.377 --> 00:11:55.844
Hey there, front row!
Having a good time?

00:11:55.844 --> 00:11:57.744
(laughing)

00:11:57.744 --> 00:11:59.177
Oh, wait.

00:11:59.177 --> 00:12:01.810
Since when have I ever cared
about entertaining the crowd?

00:12:01.810 --> 00:12:04.210
Oh, man, this is so
totally weird.

00:12:06.144 --> 00:12:08.510
Yugo, let's wow the crowd.

00:12:08.510 --> 00:12:10.210
Oh, yeah!

00:12:10.210 --> 00:12:14.110
(all shouting)

00:12:16.177 --> 00:12:18.610
Ha ha ha!

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:31.410
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Our duelists have made their
way out of the Duel Palace.

00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:33.910
Let's see where the road
takes 'em!

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:36.744
It's my turn now,
and I'm gonna make it count,

00:12:36.744 --> 00:12:38.510
'cause I'm setting
the Pendulum Scale

00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:43.144
with Scale 1 Lunalight Wolf and
Scale 5 Lunalight Tiger!

00:12:43.144 --> 00:12:46.077
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 4

00:12:46.077 --> 00:12:48.977
all at the same time!

00:12:54.544 --> 00:12:56.044
So let's get to it.

00:12:56.044 --> 00:12:58.210
First, I'm going to
Pendulum Summon

00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:02.310
the dapper but dangerous
Lunalight Black Sheep!

00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:06.810
And now the sweet yet strong,
Lunalight Purple Butterfly!

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.344
(Melissa, on P. A.)
In just two shakes
of a lamb's tail,

00:13:09.344 --> 00:13:11.377
Celina summoned
two monsters!

00:13:11.377 --> 00:13:14.644
I activate Lunalight Tiger's
pendulum ability!

00:13:14.644 --> 00:13:20.477
I can summon a Lunalight Fusion
Monster from my graveyard!

00:13:20.477 --> 00:13:23.044
So, dancing this way is...

00:13:23.044 --> 00:13:25.444
Panther Dancer!

00:13:25.444 --> 00:13:28.010
Thing is, she can't attack

00:13:28.010 --> 00:13:30.610
and gets destroyed at
the end of this turn.

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:33.644
So if Panther Dancer's
not sticking around,

00:13:33.644 --> 00:13:35.010
why bring her back?

00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.510
You want to know why?
Watch and learn.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:40.677
I activate Lunalight Wolf's
pendulum ability!

00:13:40.677 --> 00:13:43.377
It lets me summon a new powerful
Lunalight monster

00:13:43.377 --> 00:13:46.244
by banishing the monsters
on my field!

00:13:46.244 --> 00:13:50.577
I fuse Panther Dancer, Black
Sheep and Purple Butterfly!

00:13:50.577 --> 00:13:53.177
By combining the precision
of a panther,

00:13:53.177 --> 00:13:55.777
the cunning covertness of a
stealthy beast

00:13:55.777 --> 00:13:58.977
and the fluttering fury of a
nighttime huntress,

00:13:58.977 --> 00:14:03.010
I can create a new
lunar legend!

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:04.744
I Fusion Summon!

00:14:04.744 --> 00:14:06.710
The majestic, the mighty,

00:14:06.710 --> 00:14:10.710
the masterful Lunalight
Leo Dancer!

00:14:14.577 --> 00:14:16.577
With 3,500 attack points,

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:18.444
that dancer's got
all the right moves!

00:14:18.444 --> 00:14:20.910
Whoa!
Brace yourself!

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:25.244
Lunalight Leo Dancer, take down
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.477
In that case, I play...

00:14:28.477 --> 00:14:31.644
the Action Card Rejuvenation!

00:14:31.644 --> 00:14:34.610
(thinking)
The one that I choose
to ignore.

00:14:34.610 --> 00:14:37.710
Rejuvenation increases Clear
Wing Synchro Dragon's

00:14:37.710 --> 00:14:40.577
attack points by 800!

00:14:40.577 --> 00:14:42.177
And there's more!

00:14:42.177 --> 00:14:44.977
Clear Wing can't be destroyed
during this battle!

00:14:47.244 --> 00:14:48.977
Kinda strange that
I'm smiling.

00:14:48.977 --> 00:14:51.577
Had I snatched that card,
I would've saved Panther Dancer

00:14:51.577 --> 00:14:53.177
and a good chunk of
my life points.

00:14:53.177 --> 00:14:55.077
So why are you?

00:14:55.077 --> 00:14:56.844
'Cause this duel's
just that much fun.

00:14:56.844 --> 00:15:00.510
(thinking)
Guess I never knew
duel's could be fun.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:02.377
Aah!

00:15:02.377 --> 00:15:03.977
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>What a showdown!</i>

00:15:03.977 --> 00:15:06.877
This tussle's got more bite
than a rumba of
rattlesnakes!

00:15:06.877 --> 00:15:09.210
Your Clear Wing may survive.

00:15:09.210 --> 00:15:11.744
But your life points
still take a hit.

00:15:11.744 --> 00:15:14.477
And Rejuvenation's effect
is now over.

00:15:14.477 --> 00:15:17.744
So Clear Wing's attack points
return to normal.

00:15:19.944 --> 00:15:21.577
And there's more bad news.

00:15:21.577 --> 00:15:23.310
Leo Dancer's special ability

00:15:23.310 --> 00:15:25.344
automatically destroys
your monster.

00:15:25.344 --> 00:15:28.710
So say goodbye to Clear Wing!

00:15:28.710 --> 00:15:30.744
Say what?!
That's right!

00:15:30.744 --> 00:15:33.610
Your Clear Wing's clearly
no match for my Leo Dancer!

00:15:33.610 --> 00:15:35.844
I wouldn't be so sure
about that.

00:15:35.844 --> 00:15:39.844
I activate Clear Wing's special
ability once again!

00:15:41.544 --> 00:15:44.844
It not only stops Leo Dancer's
special ability,

00:15:44.844 --> 00:15:46.877
but it also destroys
your monster.

00:15:46.877 --> 00:15:48.610
Two can play at that game!

00:15:48.610 --> 00:15:51.910
Because Leo Dancer
isn't affected by your
special ability either!

00:15:51.910 --> 00:15:53.877
So we're right back
where we started.

00:15:53.877 --> 00:15:56.244
Your Clear Wing
will be destroyed.

00:15:56.244 --> 00:15:57.710
We'll see!

00:15:57.710 --> 00:15:58.877
Here goes!

00:15:58.877 --> 00:16:01.877
I banish my Action Card
so that I can activate

00:16:01.877 --> 00:16:03.710
Miracle Mirror!

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:05.544
(roaring)

00:16:05.544 --> 00:16:10.077
Clear Wing can't be destroyed
for the entire turn!

00:16:10.077 --> 00:16:12.977
Well, I still have one last
trick up my sleeve.

00:16:12.977 --> 00:16:15.544
My Leo Dancer can attack twice
in one turn,

00:16:15.544 --> 00:16:17.877
and it's double‐trouble
for you.

00:16:22.110 --> 00:16:25.177
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Yugo's down to just
200 life points.

00:16:25.177 --> 00:16:28.344
He is finished.

00:16:33.544 --> 00:16:36.410
Yugo, no matter what happens
in this duel,

00:16:36.410 --> 00:16:38.110
from here on out,

00:16:38.110 --> 00:16:41.244
you're not the chump
I thought you were.

00:16:41.244 --> 00:16:44.277
Let's see what you got.
I end my turn.

00:16:44.277 --> 00:16:46.144
Your move.

00:16:46.144 --> 00:16:48.977
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Hangin' on by a measly
200 life points,

00:16:48.977 --> 00:16:52.677
Yugo'll be deep fried and
fricasseed in no time flat!

00:16:52.677 --> 00:16:56.510
If he's gonna win, he's
gonna have to win this turn!

00:16:58.944 --> 00:17:00.244
Here I go!

00:17:00.244 --> 00:17:01.744
(both)
It's showtime!

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:05.510
For my first move,

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:08.310
I'm gonna bring the crowd
to its feet by activating

00:17:08.310 --> 00:17:11.877
The special ability of Den‐Den
Daiko Duke from my graveyard!

00:17:11.877 --> 00:17:14.244
Since I have less than
1,000 life points,

00:17:14.244 --> 00:17:17.544
by banishing it, I can
summon a Turner Monster.

00:17:17.544 --> 00:17:19.444
Duel fans, welcome back...

00:17:19.444 --> 00:17:21.877
Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice!

00:17:29.810 --> 00:17:31.210
There's more!

00:17:31.210 --> 00:17:34.077
I tune Red‐Eyed Dice with
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:17:34.077 --> 00:17:37.844
to pave the way...
for an even mightier dragon!

00:17:37.844 --> 00:17:41.610
Watch as the essence of that
monster takes shape!

00:17:41.610 --> 00:17:45.810
Watch as it is forged
by raw power!

00:17:45.810 --> 00:17:47.810
(both)
I Synchro Summon!

00:17:47.810 --> 00:17:51.177
Take flight, Crystal Wing
Synchro Dragon!

00:17:54.010 --> 00:17:55.410
Attack!

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:57.477
You're attacking?
But why?

00:17:57.477 --> 00:17:59.510
My Leo Dancer has
more attack points.

00:17:59.510 --> 00:18:01.477
Oh, yeah, I'm well aware.

00:18:01.477 --> 00:18:03.177
All right, Crystal Wing,

00:18:03.177 --> 00:18:05.677
let's end this with some
razzle‐dazzle.

00:18:05.677 --> 00:18:07.177
(roaring)

00:18:07.177 --> 00:18:10.910
And watch as its special
ability activates!

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:16.310
It's taking center stage along
with Leo Dancer's attack points!

00:18:16.310 --> 00:18:19.310
Seriously? 6,500?

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:22.077
'Fraid so.
Bye‐Bye!

00:18:22.077 --> 00:18:25.377
Go, Crystal Cataclysmic
Strike!

00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:30.844
(roaring)

00:18:38.244 --> 00:18:40.777
Uugghh!

00:18:40.777 --> 00:18:42.877
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>Yeeeee‐haaaaw!</i>

00:18:42.877 --> 00:18:45.410
There you have it,
cowpokes and cow‐quettes!

00:18:45.410 --> 00:18:48.010
Let's raise ourselves a
rip‐roarin' ruckus

00:18:48.010 --> 00:18:52.244
for the winner of this here
dynamite duel! Yugo!

00:18:52.244 --> 00:18:54.410
And this crowd is ecstatic
about it!

00:18:54.410 --> 00:18:57.110
Really, who in their right
mind wouldn't be?

00:18:59.677 --> 00:19:01.577
(crowd cheering)

00:19:08.477 --> 00:19:10.744
(cheering continues)

00:19:16.210 --> 00:19:18.610
(exhales)

00:19:18.610 --> 00:19:20.044
That was great.

00:19:20.044 --> 00:19:24.744
I wish I had always known
how fun dueling could be.

00:19:24.744 --> 00:19:26.310
Thank you.

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:29.010
You're thanking me?
For beating you?

00:19:29.010 --> 00:19:31.744
(both laughing)

00:19:31.744 --> 00:19:34.044
Huh? Yuya?

00:19:34.044 --> 00:19:36.677
What?
Nothing. Never mind.

00:19:36.677 --> 00:19:38.810
Yugo?
Yeah?

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:47.144
(chuckles)

00:19:48.577 --> 00:19:50.310
I wish you luck.

00:19:50.310 --> 00:19:52.110
Huh? Thanks.

00:19:52.110 --> 00:19:54.710
(Melissa, on, P. A.)
Oh, my! It just keeps
getting better!

00:19:54.710 --> 00:19:57.510
Now these two duelists,
rivals on the road,

00:19:57.510 --> 00:19:59.710
are forging a friendship
off of it.

00:19:59.710 --> 00:20:02.744
Truly what the Friendship
Cup's all about!

00:20:02.744 --> 00:20:05.177
Good luck in
your next duel.

00:20:05.177 --> 00:20:07.444
(chuckles nervously)
Thanks, RinRin.

00:20:11.610 --> 00:20:13.310
Uh, ha ha!

00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:17.044
Actually, forget everything
I just said.

00:20:17.044 --> 00:20:20.244
No, you're not Rin.

00:20:20.244 --> 00:20:23.310
Even she doesn't
hit that hard.

00:20:25.177 --> 00:20:28.310
Just keep your paws
off me, okay?

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.010
(thinking)
Yuya, you always said that
dueling's about having fun.

00:20:32.010 --> 00:20:34.244
I think I'm starting to get
what you mean.

00:20:39.877 --> 00:20:41.610
Huh?

00:20:45.310 --> 00:20:48.577
Was I ... dueling?

00:20:48.577 --> 00:20:52.244
I'll miss Celina, but...

00:20:52.244 --> 00:20:55.577
(laughing)
I'm stoked for what's next!

00:21:03.177 --> 00:21:05.944
(Yugo)
Though I gotta strange feeling
that what's next

00:21:05.944 --> 00:21:09.044
may be happening sooner
than later.
