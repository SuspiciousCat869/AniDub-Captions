Gong is here?

What an honor...

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:19.766
I should be in that
Turbo Duel!

00:00:19.766 --> 00:00:21.000

I gotta win this tournament

so I can take down
that traitor Jack!

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:50.800
And if that means
I have to run over Gong,

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.966

I'm gonna do.

Turbo Duel!

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.466
From my research and
reportin', I know Crow has
skills

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:38.466
that can set fire
to a barbecue,

00:02:38.466 --> 00:02:40.566

firsthand,

00:02:40.566 --> 00:02:42.566

gonna win, folks?

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.600
(Melissa)
Looks like Crow's stuck
in first gear!

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.166

Gong's comin' up on
the first corner fast.

00:03:52.066 --> 00:03:54.566

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:58.066
Careful, Gong!
(grunting)

00:04:03.333 --> 00:04:05.666
I've gotta end this fast
to help the little rugrats!

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:07.666
Crow grabbed the bull
by the horns

00:04:07.666 --> 00:04:09.833
so the first turn
is his for the takin'!

00:04:09.833 --> 00:04:12.466
(crowd shouting)

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:18.266
Aw, why can't y'all just have
a pop an' enjoy the duel?

00:04:18.266 --> 00:04:20.566
Those little legs
are so fast!

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:22.666
It's my move!
Since I don't have

00:04:22.666 --> 00:04:23.933
any monsters
on my field,

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:26.600
I can summon Blackwing,
Gust the Backblast,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.300
in attack mode!

00:04:32.166 --> 00:04:35.400
Gust the Backblast lets me
summon another Blackwing‐‐

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.866
the Tuner Monster,
Oroshi the Squall!

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:39.966
(squawking)

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:42.266
It's time to ruffle
his feathers!

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:45.466
Oroshi the Squall
tunes Gust the Backblast!

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:53.766
I synchro summon!

00:04:53.766 --> 00:04:55.600
Fly forth,
assault Blackwing,

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.200
Kuniyoshi
the white rainbow!

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.233
That Crow hatched that monster
in the blink of Gong's eye!

00:05:01.233 --> 00:05:03.233
Gong's got his work
cut out for himself!

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:07.433
(thinking)
What's he gawkin' at?

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.033
You best focus on our duel!

00:05:12.033 --> 00:05:13.433
Oh, I'm focused,
all right!

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:15.000
Focused on
taking you down!

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:31.353
You best focus on our duel!

00:05:31.353 --> 00:05:32.787
Oh, I'm focused,
all right!

00:05:32.787 --> 00:05:34.453
Focused on
taking you down!

00:05:34.453 --> 00:05:37.453
I send a Blackwing from
my hand to the graveyard

00:05:37.453 --> 00:05:41.687
so that Kuniyoshi can blow
away 300 of your life points.

00:05:41.687 --> 00:05:43.320
(grunting)

00:05:46.253 --> 00:05:49.020
Guess Gong's the one
who has t' stay focused!

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.920
Next, I'm gonna play
the Tuner Monster Blackwing‐‐

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:54.353
Blizzard the Far North!

00:05:54.353 --> 00:05:56.687
(squawking)

00:05:56.687 --> 00:05:59.387
This'll speed
my victory along.

00:05:59.387 --> 00:06:01.887
Once Blizzard the Far North
is on my field,

00:06:01.887 --> 00:06:04.753
it can also bring out another
Blackwing from my graveyard!

00:06:06.787 --> 00:06:10.253
I'm summoning Blackwing,
Jetstream the Blue Sky!

00:06:10.253 --> 00:06:12.187
(howling)

00:06:14.887 --> 00:06:17.453
I tune level 2 Blizzard
the Far North

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:20.153
with level 1
Jetstream the Blue Sky!

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:28.953
I Synchro Summon
Assault Blackwing,

00:06:28.953 --> 00:06:31.053
Kunisada the White Rainbow!

00:06:31.053 --> 00:06:33.153
(growling)

00:06:33.153 --> 00:06:35.020
A pair o' birdie
buddies, huh?

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.353
Well, Gong ain't scared
of a couple of chickens!

00:06:37.353 --> 00:06:39.687
Gong's gonna deep fry 'em!

00:06:39.687 --> 00:06:41.853
Don't bite off more
than you can chew!

00:06:41.853 --> 00:06:45.120
Kunisada lets me bring
a Blackwing in my graveyard

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.287
back to my hand,
and then I can add

00:06:47.287 --> 00:06:50.487
its attack points
to both my Synchro Monsters

00:06:50.487 --> 00:06:53.987
so my two Blackwings
will be flying high!

00:06:53.987 --> 00:06:56.553
Those attack points
just got supersized!

00:06:56.553 --> 00:06:59.920
Unfortunately, I have to wait
until my next turn to attack.

00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.887
It's your move, so
hurry up and make it!

00:07:02.887 --> 00:07:06.920
Crow's totally cruisin'.
Why is he in such a rush?

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.387
Battling
on this duel runner

00:07:08.387 --> 00:07:09.820
is gonna take some
gettin' used to,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:11.153
but Gong'll get it!

00:07:11.153 --> 00:07:13.353
To win,
Gong's gotta adapt!

00:07:14.887 --> 00:07:18.353
(thinking)
Where did those three
rascals run off to?

00:07:18.353 --> 00:07:21.720
(thinking)
He's eyeballin'
the stands again!

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.053
Yo, Crow, we're supposed
t' be duelin' here!

00:07:24.053 --> 00:07:25.887
Whatcha doin',
countin' how many fans

00:07:25.887 --> 00:07:27.220
y' got in the stands!?

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.787
Well, when Gong's
done with ya,

00:07:28.787 --> 00:07:30.320
you won't have
a single one left!

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.687
Gong don't like
bein' ignored!

00:07:34.687 --> 00:07:37.387
Bet Gong's Superheavy
Samurai Magnet

00:07:37.387 --> 00:07:38.753
will keep ya focused,

00:07:38.753 --> 00:07:40.220
but if that
don't do the trick,

00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:42.453
maybe its special
ability will!

00:07:42.453 --> 00:07:44.887
It lets Gong
bring out a second one!

00:07:44.887 --> 00:07:48.587
So, come on out,
Superheavy Samurai Magnet!

00:07:48.587 --> 00:07:50.553
You better stop
your dueldreaming

00:07:50.553 --> 00:07:53.787
'cause Gong just created
an impenetrable defense!

00:07:53.787 --> 00:07:56.753
When Gong has two Superheavy
Samurai Magnets out,

00:07:56.753 --> 00:07:59.020
their special abilities
stop your battlin' birds

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.520
from attacking Gong at all.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:03.120
Gong's turn's done!

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:05.953
Huh. This is gonna take longer
than I had hoped it would.

00:08:05.953 --> 00:08:09.053
Huh?
Where'd they disappear to?

00:08:09.053 --> 00:08:11.653
(thinking)
I got enough on my plate
with this duel

00:08:11.653 --> 00:08:13.853
without having
to worry about them.

00:08:13.853 --> 00:08:16.487
It's my turn!
Hah!

00:08:16.487 --> 00:08:18.953
Oh, my, those chickens
have been tendered!

00:08:18.953 --> 00:08:21.153
Crow's gonna have
t' change things up!

00:08:21.153 --> 00:08:23.287
By sendin' Blackwing,
Harmattan the Dust

00:08:23.287 --> 00:08:24.987
to the graveyard,
I can activate

00:08:24.987 --> 00:08:27.053
Kuniyoshi's
special ability

00:08:27.053 --> 00:08:29.187
and deal you
300 points of damage!

00:08:30.987 --> 00:08:32.320
Got Gong again!

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.987
When it comes
t' sneaky skills,

00:08:33.987 --> 00:08:36.487
Crow Hogan's as crafty
as a cattle rustler!

00:08:36.487 --> 00:08:39.687
I summon Blackwing Blizzard,
the North Wind!

00:08:39.687 --> 00:08:41.220
(roaring)

00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:43.720
Then, with the help of
Blizzard's special ability,

00:08:43.720 --> 00:08:46.987
I can summon
Harmattan the Dust
from my graveyard!

00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:50.053
(squawking)

00:08:50.053 --> 00:08:52.353
Looks like Crow's head
is back in the game.

00:08:52.353 --> 00:08:54.887
He's playing his cards
as perfectly as possible,

00:08:54.887 --> 00:08:57.053
finding ways to
still deal damage

00:08:57.053 --> 00:08:59.620
even when Gong stopped
him from attacking.

00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:01.820
Crow's pretty crafty!

00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:04.053
(thinking)
Kids, just hang in there!

00:09:04.053 --> 00:09:07.253
I'm taking my game
to the next level... literally!

00:09:07.253 --> 00:09:09.787
Thanks to Harmattan's
special ability,

00:09:09.787 --> 00:09:13.253
I can increase
its level from 2 to 5!

00:09:13.253 --> 00:09:15.187
All right.
Seal the deal!

00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:19.853
I Synchro Summon!

00:09:19.853 --> 00:09:22.320
Spread your wings,
Assault Blackwing,

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:24.587
Raikiri
the Rain Shower!

00:09:24.587 --> 00:09:26.720
I've got
a whole battalion now,

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.053
and Raikiri can use that
to its advantage,

00:09:29.053 --> 00:09:31.053
'cause for each
Blackwing on my field,

00:09:31.053 --> 00:09:33.220
it can destroy one of
your monsters!

00:09:33.220 --> 00:09:35.253
Billy Biscuits!
You found a way

00:09:35.253 --> 00:09:37.653
to destroy Gong's Magnets
without attackin'!

00:09:37.653 --> 00:09:39.653
That's right. Both your
Magnets are destroyed,

00:09:39.653 --> 00:09:42.253
so now I can attack you!

00:09:42.253 --> 00:09:44.387
(Melissa) Crow trampled
those defenses

00:09:44.387 --> 00:09:47.487
like a herd
o' angry steer!

00:09:47.487 --> 00:09:50.953
Raikiri, how 'bout you
make it rain with pain!

00:09:50.953 --> 00:09:52.220
(growling)

00:09:52.220 --> 00:09:53.720
Oh, no!
If that attack hits,

00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:56.053
Gong's gonna have barely
any life points left!

00:09:56.053 --> 00:09:58.487
Gong, do something quick
before it's too late!

00:09:59.587 --> 00:10:01.253
(Melissa)
<i>Oh, an action card!</i>

00:10:01.253 --> 00:10:02.753
That right there is one
o' them special cards

00:10:02.753 --> 00:10:04.087
scattered around
the track!

00:10:04.087 --> 00:10:06.687
Can Gong grab it in time
to save his hide?

00:10:07.753 --> 00:10:09.087
(grunting)

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:14.520
(growling)

00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.313
(growling)

00:10:32.313 --> 00:10:34.613
Oh, yeah! Crow's attack
was too slow by a hair!

00:10:34.613 --> 00:10:36.880
Gong's gonna get
the action card in time!

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.013
I wonder how he's gonna
use it to save his hide.

00:10:39.013 --> 00:10:41.647
What the what?
He let it pass him by!

00:10:43.213 --> 00:10:44.980
Oh no, Gong!

00:10:48.713 --> 00:10:50.513
Well, letting
that action card go

00:10:50.513 --> 00:10:52.113
was a mistake
for the ages.

00:10:52.113 --> 00:10:54.413
Gong's playing
like a tenderfoot.

00:10:54.413 --> 00:10:55.880
I thought
it was customary

00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.813
for duelists from
your standard dimension

00:10:57.813 --> 00:10:59.547
to utilize
action cards.

00:10:59.547 --> 00:11:01.347
This is Gong's
style of dueling,

00:11:01.347 --> 00:11:04.813
and his dueling style is
different from the rest of us.

00:11:04.813 --> 00:11:06.647
(thinking)
What's Gong up to?

00:11:06.647 --> 00:11:08.480
Gong's gotta tip
Gong's helmet to you

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.013
for destroyin'
Gong's Magnets.

00:11:10.013 --> 00:11:11.947
But since
Gong took damage,

00:11:11.947 --> 00:11:14.013
and there's no spell
or trap cards

00:11:14.013 --> 00:11:15.280
in Gong's graveyard,

00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.580
Gong can summon this here

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.913
Superheavy Samurai
in defense mode!

00:11:18.913 --> 00:11:20.513
Oh, yeah!

00:11:20.513 --> 00:11:24.147
Show your mettle, Superheavy
Samurai Prepped Defense!

00:11:24.147 --> 00:11:26.613
(thinking)
Oh, now I see
why he didn't grab it.

00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:28.113
Because he wouldn't
have been able

00:11:28.113 --> 00:11:30.080
to summon his monster
if he did.

00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:31.747
But it's not gonna work!

00:11:31.747 --> 00:11:33.513
Your move, Gong!

00:11:33.513 --> 00:11:37.113
Gong's rarin' t' go!

00:11:37.113 --> 00:11:40.913
And Gong's gonna get Gong's turn
off to a high‐powered start

00:11:40.913 --> 00:11:43.080
by settin'
the Pendulum Scale usin'

00:11:43.080 --> 00:11:46.780
Superheavy Samurai Generals
Jade and Coral!

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:48.580
Now Gong's allowed
to summon monsters

00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.480
from Level 2 through 7,
all at the same time!

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:53.847
Gong Pendulum Summons...

00:11:53.847 --> 00:11:55.013
...and brings out

00:11:55.013 --> 00:11:57.080
Superheavy
Samurai Trumpeter...

00:11:58.347 --> 00:12:01.447
and Superheavy
Samurai Flutist!

00:12:02.780 --> 00:12:04.547
(crowd murmuring)

00:12:13.013 --> 00:12:15.380
Time for
some heavy‐lifting!

00:12:15.380 --> 00:12:17.280
General Jade's
pendulum ability

00:12:17.280 --> 00:12:20.013
can raise the level of
Superheavy Samurai Trumpeter

00:12:20.013 --> 00:12:21.513
from 2 to 3!

00:12:24.047 --> 00:12:25.680
And now Gong tunes

00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:27.747
Superheavy
Samurai Trumpeter

00:12:27.747 --> 00:12:30.180
with Prepped Defense
and Flutist!

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.980
Bring it together, guys!

00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:42.147
Gong synchro summons...

00:12:42.147 --> 00:12:46.713
Superheavy Samurai
Beast Kyubi!

00:12:46.713 --> 00:12:49.647
(roaring)
Kyubi!

00:12:49.647 --> 00:12:51.713
That's some serious
summoning right there!

00:12:51.713 --> 00:12:52.980
Despicable!

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.113
Gong's the understudy,
and I'm the main attraction!

00:12:55.113 --> 00:12:56.480
I'm the one who's
supposed to be out there

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:58.080
getting showered
with applause!

00:12:58.080 --> 00:12:59.847
(man)
Gong's rocked so good!

00:12:59.847 --> 00:13:02.113
He's gonna seal
the deal, man!

00:13:02.113 --> 00:13:04.880
Golly! They're all
rootin' for Gong!

00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:08.380
But now he's gotta strike
while the branding iron's
hot.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:09.980
Gong's Superheavy
Samurai is

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:11.647
about to get
even heavier!

00:13:11.647 --> 00:13:14.313
Kyubi picks up
900 defense points

00:13:14.313 --> 00:13:17.147
for each monster
on your field!

00:13:17.147 --> 00:13:18.913
So you're playing it
super‐safe.

00:13:18.913 --> 00:13:20.713
<i>Au contraire, mon frère,</i>

00:13:20.713 --> 00:13:22.313
even if Kyubi is
in defense mode,

00:13:22.313 --> 00:13:24.447
it can use
its defense points to attack!

00:13:24.447 --> 00:13:26.380
It deals damage
with defense points!?

00:13:26.380 --> 00:13:28.047
Only restriction is
that it has to attack

00:13:28.047 --> 00:13:30.580
the monster with
the most attack points!

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:35.880
Kyubi, attack Raikiri
the Rain Shower!

00:13:45.013 --> 00:13:47.280
Crow just took
a slue o' damage!

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.013
<i>He's in big trouble!</i>

00:13:49.013 --> 00:13:51.247
Gong's bringing it!
(growling)

00:13:51.247 --> 00:13:54.447
General Coral's
Pendulum Ability activates!

00:13:54.447 --> 00:13:56.580
Since Kyubi destroyed
your monster,

00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.513
Gong can tribute
General Coral

00:13:58.513 --> 00:14:01.447
to allow Kyubi
to attack again!

00:14:01.447 --> 00:14:03.013
Uh‐oh!

00:14:03.013 --> 00:14:05.447
I don't like
the sound of that!

00:14:05.447 --> 00:14:07.613
Say goodbye
to your Kunisada

00:14:07.613 --> 00:14:10.613
and the rest of
your life points!

00:14:10.613 --> 00:14:12.913
I wouldn't be
so sure, Gong.

00:14:12.913 --> 00:14:15.247
A duel isn't over till
the last card is played!

00:14:15.247 --> 00:14:16.547
Don't kid yourself!

00:14:16.547 --> 00:14:18.780
Gong could tell you weren't
focused on this duel,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:21.280
and it's coming back
to haunt you, big time.

00:14:21.280 --> 00:14:22.980
You're gonna lose
'cause you've been

00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:24.680
distracted
from the get‐go!

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:25.980
Huh?

00:14:27.747 --> 00:14:29.013
That's them!

00:14:29.013 --> 00:14:30.147
Hmm?

00:14:30.147 --> 00:14:32.380
Oh, no...

00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.513
Run, guys!

00:14:34.813 --> 00:14:35.847
This way!

00:14:35.847 --> 00:14:37.380
Stop those kids!

00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.747
(growling)

00:14:38.747 --> 00:14:40.413
So those pipsqueaks
are the ones

00:14:40.413 --> 00:14:41.913
tugging on
your brain stem?

00:14:41.913 --> 00:14:43.780
Who are they?

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:46.447
They're... my family.

00:14:56.713 --> 00:14:57.680
Huh?

00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:08.180
I remember the day
I found 'the lil jackals.

00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:10.980
I was just gonna feed 'em
and send 'em on their way.

00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:13.447
(all gobbling)

00:15:13.447 --> 00:15:14.847
Don't eat so fast!

00:15:14.847 --> 00:15:16.780
This isn't a race,
y' know!

00:15:16.780 --> 00:15:18.347
(gurgling)
Are you okay?

00:15:18.347 --> 00:15:20.213
Terron!

00:15:20.213 --> 00:15:21.913
(burping)

00:15:21.913 --> 00:15:24.580
Hey, Terron,
you just grew a mustache!

00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.447
Oh, yeah? Well, you have
one, too, A‐man‐da!

00:15:27.447 --> 00:15:28.980
Well, so do you‐‐ hah!

00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:30.280
Really?

00:15:30.280 --> 00:15:32.413
You saving that
for later?

00:15:32.413 --> 00:15:34.947
Hey, don't give me
any lip, three lips.

00:15:34.947 --> 00:15:36.613
Well, your soup‐stache
is super ugly!

00:15:36.613 --> 00:15:37.913
Oh, brother!

00:15:37.913 --> 00:15:39.580
But it is
super tasty!

00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.380
Livin' in the slums can
take its toll on you.

00:15:42.380 --> 00:15:45.780
It'd been a long time since
anything made me smile.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.980
Everything has
changed for me

00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:50.880
since those three pups
became part of my clan.

00:15:50.880 --> 00:15:53.580
Let me tell ya, those kids
can drive me up a wall,

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:55.647
but I'd do
anything for 'em.

00:15:55.647 --> 00:15:58.547
Maybe by dueling and winning
the Friendship Cup Tournament,

00:15:58.547 --> 00:16:00.980
I can show the lil' brats
that even commons like us

00:16:00.980 --> 00:16:03.547
can reach as high as the sky
and touch our dreams.

00:16:03.547 --> 00:16:05.113
Hang on now...

00:16:05.113 --> 00:16:08.413
Huh, it looks like
Gong's not the only one

00:16:08.413 --> 00:16:10.413
who has something to duel for,
don't it?

00:16:12.547 --> 00:16:14.447
Go, Crow!
Huh?

00:16:14.447 --> 00:16:16.080
Rule your duel!

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.180
Give Gong
the duel of his life!

00:16:18.180 --> 00:16:19.480
Huh?

00:16:20.780 --> 00:16:22.147
Listen up, Crow!

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:24.480
Holdin' back
isn't Gong's style,

00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:26.247
so if you wanna win
this turbo duel

00:16:26.247 --> 00:16:28.013
and give your
little pals hope,

00:16:28.013 --> 00:16:29.613
then you'd better
come at Gong

00:16:29.613 --> 00:16:30.947
with everything you've got,

00:16:30.947 --> 00:16:33.380
and Gong means
everything!

00:16:35.713 --> 00:16:36.980
Huh.

00:16:38.113 --> 00:16:39.713
Brace yourself!

00:16:39.713 --> 00:16:41.813
Cause you're about
to get Gonged!

00:16:41.813 --> 00:16:44.847
Thanks to General Coral's
special ability,

00:16:44.847 --> 00:16:46.680
it'll be takin'
one for the team,

00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:49.480
so that Kyubi can
attack again!

00:16:49.480 --> 00:16:50.947
All set, Kyubi!?

00:16:50.947 --> 00:16:53.213
Attack Kunisada
the White Rainbow

00:16:53.213 --> 00:16:55.180
and win Gong the duel!

00:17:06.564 --> 00:17:08.331
Attack Kunisada
the White Rainbow

00:17:08.331 --> 00:17:09.998
and win Gong the duel!

00:17:09.998 --> 00:17:11.464
<i>Crow's a goner!</i>

00:17:11.464 --> 00:17:12.731
Not if I can help it!

00:17:13.798 --> 00:17:15.898
I activate the action card...

00:17:15.898 --> 00:17:17.064
Evasion!

00:17:17.064 --> 00:17:19.031
It lets me dodge your attack!

00:17:20.564 --> 00:17:24.264
Crow lassoed that action card
just in the nick o' time!

00:17:24.264 --> 00:17:26.231
(cheering)

00:17:28.364 --> 00:17:31.231
That was some first‐class
turbo duelin'...

00:17:31.231 --> 00:17:33.564
but all your super slick
maneuvers are just

00:17:33.564 --> 00:17:35.431
delaying
the inevitable!

00:17:35.431 --> 00:17:38.198
None of your monsters are
strong enough to stop Kyubi!

00:17:38.198 --> 00:17:40.264
I end my turn!

00:17:40.264 --> 00:17:42.964
And since Superheavy
Samurai General Jade

00:17:42.964 --> 00:17:44.998
is the only monster
in my Pendulum Zone,

00:17:44.998 --> 00:17:46.531
it's destroyed.

00:17:49.031 --> 00:17:50.798
(thinking)
Gotta find a way
t' get rid of that thing!

00:17:52.031 --> 00:17:54.598
I may be down,
but I'm not out!

00:17:54.598 --> 00:17:57.864
The spell Against the Wind
should get me back in the game!

00:17:57.864 --> 00:18:00.064
I can retrieve Blackwing
The Far North

00:18:00.064 --> 00:18:02.098
from my graveyard
by taking damage

00:18:02.098 --> 00:18:03.731
equal to its
attack points.

00:18:03.731 --> 00:18:06.398
That move was bold
but risky.

00:18:06.398 --> 00:18:08.564
You got, like,
no life points.

00:18:08.564 --> 00:18:10.564
You... in trouble!

00:18:10.564 --> 00:18:12.898
I summon Blackwing
Blizzard the Far North!

00:18:15.964 --> 00:18:19.198
And now I'll activate
Blizzard's special ability

00:18:19.198 --> 00:18:21.864
to summon Jetstream
the Blue Sky!

00:18:21.864 --> 00:18:24.131
(growling)

00:18:24.131 --> 00:18:27.331
Jetstream the Blue Sky tunes
with Blizzard the Far North!

00:18:30.931 --> 00:18:34.131
This is the first step
towards finishing this duel!

00:18:35.664 --> 00:18:37.098
I Synchro Summon

00:18:37.098 --> 00:18:38.698
Assault Blackwing

00:18:38.698 --> 00:18:41.631
Kunifusa
the White Rainbow!

00:18:41.631 --> 00:18:43.864
By you callin' out
another Synchro Monster,

00:18:43.864 --> 00:18:45.864
the defense points
of Gong's Kyubi

00:18:45.864 --> 00:18:47.531
soar even higher!

00:18:47.531 --> 00:18:49.164
Yeah, I know,
but since I used

00:18:49.164 --> 00:18:51.631
a Blackwing
to Synchro Summon Kunifusa,

00:18:51.631 --> 00:18:53.631
it turns into
a Tuner monster,

00:18:53.631 --> 00:18:56.298
so that give me
some interesting options!

00:18:56.298 --> 00:18:58.498
Huh!? You've gotta be
goofin' ol' Gong!

00:18:58.498 --> 00:18:59.831
'Fraid not!

00:18:59.831 --> 00:19:01.764
Level 3 Kunifusa Tunes

00:19:01.764 --> 00:19:04.631
both Kuniyoshi and Kunisada
the White Rainbows!

00:19:06.764 --> 00:19:08.564
Assault Blackwings,

00:19:08.564 --> 00:19:10.364
combine your strength
to call forth

00:19:10.364 --> 00:19:12.464
the harbinger of disaster!

00:19:15.264 --> 00:19:17.931
I Synchro Summon!

00:19:17.931 --> 00:19:19.898
Here comes
Assault Blackwing

00:19:19.898 --> 00:19:22.531
Kusanagi the Gathering Storm!

00:19:22.531 --> 00:19:25.098
(growling)

00:19:25.098 --> 00:19:26.798
Since he's got
fewer monsters,

00:19:26.798 --> 00:19:29.631
that's gonna put a serious hit
on Kyubi's defense points.

00:19:29.631 --> 00:19:33.364
Woo‐wee! Crow's chargin'
harder than an angry steer!

00:19:33.364 --> 00:19:34.664
I think
you'll all agree

00:19:34.664 --> 00:19:37.898
he's puttin' on quite
an extravaganza!

00:19:37.898 --> 00:19:39.164
Go, Crow!
Woo‐hoo!

00:19:39.164 --> 00:19:40.131
Yeah!
Get 'im!

00:19:40.131 --> 00:19:41.864
Are you ready, Gong!?

00:19:41.864 --> 00:19:43.764
Kusanagi is
about to become

00:19:43.764 --> 00:19:46.231
more powerful than
you ever thought possible!

00:19:46.231 --> 00:19:47.631
It gains
the attack points

00:19:47.631 --> 00:19:50.264
of all three White Rainbows
I used to summon it!

00:19:52.098 --> 00:19:53.998
6,000 attack points!

00:19:53.998 --> 00:19:55.931
Kusanagi
the Gathering Storm,

00:19:55.931 --> 00:19:59.398
bring the thunder and lightning
and attack Gong's Kyubi!

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:01.898
Good thing Gong's monster
is in defense mode

00:20:01.898 --> 00:20:03.698
'cause Gong won't
take any damage.

00:20:03.698 --> 00:20:05.864
Kusanagi still
deals you damage

00:20:05.864 --> 00:20:08.031
even if your monster is
in defense mode.

00:20:08.031 --> 00:20:09.164
No!

00:20:11.564 --> 00:20:13.598
(thunder crashing)

00:20:19.364 --> 00:20:21.031
No way!

00:20:24.198 --> 00:20:25.598
<i>Hoo‐wee!</i>

00:20:25.598 --> 00:20:26.864
<i>Local yokel Crow Hogan</i>

00:20:26.864 --> 00:20:28.664
and his team
o' feathered fighters

00:20:28.664 --> 00:20:30.698
<i>win the openin' duel!</i>

00:20:30.698 --> 00:20:33.164
(roaring and cheering)

00:20:33.164 --> 00:20:35.531
Whoopee!
You were terrif, Crow!

00:20:38.198 --> 00:20:40.164
That sure was a close one.

00:20:40.164 --> 00:20:42.731
Gong put up a fight,
but I finished up strong.

00:20:42.731 --> 00:20:44.564
(kids)
Yay, Crow!

00:20:44.564 --> 00:20:46.431
That was amazing, Crow!
You showed him who's boss!

00:20:48.498 --> 00:20:50.331
Nice dueling!

00:20:51.864 --> 00:20:53.664
Guys, time to vamoose
our caboose!

00:20:53.664 --> 00:20:55.131
Freeze, you brats!

00:20:55.131 --> 00:20:57.198
This meeting of
the Crow Hogan Fan Club

00:20:57.198 --> 00:20:58.931
is officially
adjourned!

00:20:58.931 --> 00:21:00.531
(crowd murmurs)

00:21:00.531 --> 00:21:02.498
Move it!
Let us through!

00:21:08.764 --> 00:21:09.998
Yo, Crow.

00:21:09.998 --> 00:21:11.764
Gong's faced
some gutsy duelists,

00:21:11.764 --> 00:21:13.098
but you out‐gut 'em all!

00:21:15.464 --> 00:21:17.131
You're not bad
yourself.

00:21:20.264 --> 00:21:22.764
(cheering)

00:21:22.764 --> 00:21:24.264
You rock, Crow!

00:21:24.264 --> 00:21:25.931
Truly a splendid
performance!

00:21:28.998 --> 00:21:32.731
Dueling really can
bring us all together.

00:21:32.731 --> 00:21:35.631
The crowd was arguing
with each other before the duel,

00:21:35.631 --> 00:21:38.898
but they're now
all cheering as one.

00:21:38.898 --> 00:21:41.864
Gong, thanks for
proving that.
