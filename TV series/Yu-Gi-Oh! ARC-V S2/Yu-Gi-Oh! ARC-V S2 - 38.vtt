WEBVTT

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:02.900
(Yuya) Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:03.933 --> 00:00:06.466
You're the snake who took Rin.

00:00:06.466 --> 00:00:07.700
I want her back now!

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.333
Where you going,
you coward?!

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.000
We have her, Director Roget.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.366
(Roget)
<i>Good. Now bring her here.</i>

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:20.633
You lost or somethin', kid?

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:22.833
Let's duel.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:24.966
I Xyz Summon...

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:28.233
Triple‐C Rock Armor Of Battle!

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.600
Crush Security and his
Catapult!

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.366
Uhh!

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.733
(Celina)
Thank you, Riley,
for saving me.

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.633
Huh?

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.533
Moon Shadow.

00:00:42.533 --> 00:00:44.633
(Roget)
<i>Do you have Celina?</i>

00:00:44.633 --> 00:00:48.733
Yes, we have Celina,
and and she is safe with us now.

00:00:48.733 --> 00:00:50.833
(groans)

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:52.533
How could this be?

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.800
If you really wanted
to arrest me,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:56.100
you should have
sent more men.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.300
(growls)

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.500
I'll never allow you
to have Celina or Zuzu.

00:01:01.766 --> 00:01:04.300
Have you fixed Sergey's cerebral
restrictor yet?

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:07.266
Yes, sir. He should
obey you all the time now.

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:09.266
Send him to the
Council Building

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.733
and tell him to
bring me Declan.

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:14.266
(man)
All security teams
in position, sir.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:18.600
(Roget)
Good. Stand by and wait
for my orders.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.733
(thinking)
Declan, you think you've got
everything under control.

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:26.400
Well, it's time I knock you off
of your high horse.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.733
Here's the first match up of the
Friendship Cup semifinals:

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:33.333

(crowd chanting)
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400
Yuya! Yuya!

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.033
Go Crow! Go Crow! Go Crow!
Go Crow!

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.800
(cheering)

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.233
(thinking)
Those helmet heads have Yuya
locked up somewhere in there.

00:03:02.233 --> 00:03:05.766
It's time for the first
tussle of the semifinals.

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:08.866
And it's gonna be Crow
having a go at Yuya!

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:10.033
(thinking)
Yuya's dueling?

00:03:10.033 --> 00:03:11.933
But I thought he'd be handcuffed
and behind bars?

00:03:11.933 --> 00:03:13.100
Something's up.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:18.466
Checkmate is at hand.

00:03:18.466 --> 00:03:20.500
I'd be more assured
about this duel

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.000
if I was able to implant Yuya's
cerebral restrictor,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.266
but Declan's interference
forced me to advance my time
schedule.

00:03:28.266 --> 00:03:33.133
Still, I have other ways to
keep Yuya under my control.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:36.533
And he doesn't even
realize it.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:38.433
The fools in this city

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:41.666
can never tear their eyes away
from the Friendship Cup,

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:45.500
so Yuya and Crow's duel will
provide the perfect distraction.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.633
While everyone is preoccupied,

00:03:48.633 --> 00:03:52.300
my Security forces will teach
Declan and the High Council

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.500
the toughest of lessons.

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.566
Yuya must keep dueling for this
plan to work.

00:03:59.566 --> 00:04:03.966
So I'm leaving nothing
to chance.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:08.000
(thinking)
Roget tried to threaten me,
flatter me, dupe me, scare me,

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.100
and every other dirty trick in
the dictionary

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:11.666
to get me to play along.

00:04:11.666 --> 00:04:14.133
Too bad for him I've got
other ideas.

00:04:14.133 --> 00:04:17.333
It's time to swing
into action.

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.866
Yuya, make this the most
spectacular duel

00:04:20.866 --> 00:04:22.600
New Domino has ever seen.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.333
And after it's all over,

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:26.966
the people of this city
will discover

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:30.133
that they have a new
and rightful ruler.

00:04:30.133 --> 00:04:33.166
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Yuya Sakaki and Crow Hogan
have just saddled up

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:36.533
for what promises to be our
most dynamite duel yet,

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:37.700
<i>'ya hear?</i>

00:04:47.366 --> 00:04:48.500
Hey, Yuya.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.966
I'm sorry.
Huh?

00:04:50.966 --> 00:04:53.333
I was convinced you
and the other Lancers

00:04:53.333 --> 00:04:55.166
had teamed up with
the Topsiders.

00:04:55.166 --> 00:04:57.066
But I was wrong

00:04:57.066 --> 00:04:59.066
My duel against Shay
helped me see

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:01.500
that the Commons and the Lancers
are really fighting

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.700
for the same cause, maybe just
in different dimensions.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.666
Whatever happens
on the track today,

00:05:07.666 --> 00:05:10.233
I want you to know you can
count on me as a friend.

00:05:10.233 --> 00:05:12.733
And I know now that
I can count on you, too.

00:05:12.733 --> 00:05:14.600
Definitely.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.500
Ah, but let's leave this mushy
stuff out of our match.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.900
This is a duel
I need to win.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.166
For all the kids
in the city.

00:05:23.166 --> 00:05:25.200
You hear me, Yuya?

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:27.066
And you better not
hold back either.

00:05:27.066 --> 00:05:28.566
Hmm.

00:05:28.566 --> 00:05:29.900
Crow, hear me out.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.033
I originally wanted
to battle you

00:05:32.033 --> 00:05:34.500
to show people what
dueling is truly about.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.266
How it can entertain and turn
strangers into friends.

00:05:38.266 --> 00:05:41.400
But we've got
bigger problems tonight

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.500
And all the trouble
starts with Roget.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.066
Him again?
What's up?

00:05:48.466 --> 00:05:51.366
(Yuya)
Last I heard,
Roget and Sector Security

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:53.300
have the High Council on
lockdown.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.233
They even captured Declan
and Riley!

00:05:56.233 --> 00:05:58.166
What? Why would
they do that?

00:05:58.166 --> 00:06:01.966
Roget wants to take over
New Domino City.

00:06:01.966 --> 00:06:03.333
(growls)

00:06:03.333 --> 00:06:05.033
If that creep becomes ruler,

00:06:05.033 --> 00:06:07.100
the Commons will have
even less freedom!

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:09.233
Somebody has to find a way
to stop him!

00:06:09.233 --> 00:06:11.400
There's still a chance
to shut him down,

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.066
but it's not gonna be easy.

00:06:13.066 --> 00:06:14.500
I can't do it alone.

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.300
I need your help.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.400
Huh. Anything to stick it
to Roget.

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:26.500
A dead end.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.533
That snake gave me
the slip.

00:06:28.533 --> 00:06:30.966
But he can't dodge me forever.

00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:32.933
Once we reach
the underground,

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:34.733
you will be safe.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:40.833
The sun has set,

00:06:40.833 --> 00:06:43.266
and our duelists are itchin'
to burn the asphalt!

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:46.700
It may take heaps of electricity
to light up the race course,

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:49.833
but there's even more sparks
a‐flyin' in the stadium

00:06:49.833 --> 00:06:52.800
as our duelists prepare
to clash!

00:06:54.133 --> 00:06:56.966
(thinking)
I promised Zuzu
I'd rescue Yuya,

00:06:56.966 --> 00:06:59.766
and that's exactly what
I'm going to do!

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:04.200
(blades whirring)
Uhh!

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:06.566
(thinking)
I just need to get into

00:07:06.566 --> 00:07:09.333
the perfect position
to help him out.

00:07:09.333 --> 00:07:10.266
Uhh!

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.933
Uhh!

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:20.500
It's turbo time!

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:26.566
And time to fire up the Action
Field Crossover Acceleration!

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:29.666
(computer voice)
Duel Mode engaged.
Autopilot activated.

00:07:29.666 --> 00:07:32.700
(horn honks)

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:34.566
(Melisa, on P. A.)
<i>On your marks.</i>

00:07:34.566 --> 00:07:36.133
<i>Get set.</i>

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:37.500
<i>Go!</i>

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:38.566
(crowd cheering)

00:07:38.566 --> 00:07:40.000
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.666
(Melissa)
Our card slingers are bolting
down the track

00:07:42.666 --> 00:07:44.866
like a pair of rampagin'
rhinos!

00:07:44.866 --> 00:07:47.666
First out of the Palace Gates
get's to go first.

00:07:47.666 --> 00:07:51.766
Who's gonna take the first
step towards victory?

00:07:56.233 --> 00:07:59.500
♪

00:07:59.500 --> 00:08:02.300
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>And first up is Crow!</i>

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:04.233
All right!
Here I go!

00:08:04.233 --> 00:08:08.433
And here comes...
Blackwing, Bora the Spear!

00:08:11.233 --> 00:08:13.133
That ought to
do it for now.

00:08:13.133 --> 00:08:15.233
It's your move, Yuya.

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:18.766
(thinking)
If Roget moved this duel up
from tomorrow to tonight,

00:08:18.766 --> 00:08:21.000
he definitely did it
for a reason.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.600
And that reason
can't be any good.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:26.800
But Yuya and I have a plan to
through a wrench in the works.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.766
(thinking)
In order for Roget to
take over the city,

00:08:29.766 --> 00:08:32.766
he has to keep the High Council
locked up in their chambers.

00:08:32.766 --> 00:08:34.433
But if I can free the Council,

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:38.266
Roget loses all his leverage
and his scheme is foiled.

00:08:38.266 --> 00:08:40.700
(Crow, thinking)
This highway leads straight to

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:42.933
the Council at the Hall
of Dominion.

00:08:42.933 --> 00:08:44.966
So as long as we keep dueling,

00:08:44.966 --> 00:08:48.333
Roget will have no idea what
we're up to!

00:08:48.333 --> 00:08:52.766
Hey, Yuya, we can still
entertain the crowd
'till we get there.

00:08:52.766 --> 00:08:54.233
Sounds good to me.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:56.600
Yeah. Now do your thing

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.800
and give this crowd
a wake‐up call.

00:08:58.800 --> 00:08:59.833
Hm!

00:08:59.833 --> 00:09:02.800
Greetings, one and all!
On with the show!

00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:05.700
I hope you folks are ready to
have some fun tonight,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:08.000
because I've reached deep into
my deck to prepare

00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:10.966
a debonair, dueltaining display
just for you!

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.433
I draw!

00:09:13.433 --> 00:09:17.233
To start, I'll conjure up a
beat to get us in the groove!

00:09:17.233 --> 00:09:21.100
Hippo Carnival will bring out
my prancing pachyderms.

00:09:21.100 --> 00:09:24.333
Wait, better yet,
let me super‐size it!

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:26.233
Super Hippo Carnival.

00:09:26.233 --> 00:09:28.666
Here's the herbivore
that gives you more.

00:09:28.666 --> 00:09:31.266
Performapal Hip Hippo!

00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:35.633
This hippo's no solo act.

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:37.533
Check out his dance troupe.

00:09:37.533 --> 00:09:40.500
Taking the stage is
ten tons of fun!

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:43.966
Folks, give 'em
a warm welcome!

00:09:43.966 --> 00:09:45.466
Ba ba!
Ba ba!

00:09:45.466 --> 00:09:47.566
Ba ba!
Ba ba!

00:09:47.566 --> 00:09:49.333
They're primed and loose...

00:09:49.333 --> 00:09:50.766
to shake that caboose!

00:09:50.766 --> 00:09:53.733
(all)
Ba ba! Ba ba!

00:09:53.733 --> 00:09:54.933
Ba!

00:09:54.933 --> 00:09:55.966
Better in rehearsal.

00:09:55.966 --> 00:09:58.666
But you didn't expect
a herd of hippos

00:09:58.666 --> 00:10:00.700
to have so much pep
in their step!

00:10:00.700 --> 00:10:02.733
And all you kids watching
at home,

00:10:02.733 --> 00:10:05.500
get off the couch, join in
and boogie on down!

00:10:07.466 --> 00:10:09.066
(Melissa, on P. A.)
I'm not exactly sure
what Yuya

00:10:09.066 --> 00:10:11.033
is tryin' to lasso
with this strategy,

00:10:11.033 --> 00:10:14.200
but the crowd's soaking it up
like a sponge in a water tank!

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:16.233
They've all gone hippo‐happy!

00:10:16.233 --> 00:10:19.900
I won't let Yuya's dancers
hog the spotlight!

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.700
I activate the trap
Blackwing Festival!

00:10:23.700 --> 00:10:26.233
Yuya has plenty of
talent on his team,

00:10:26.233 --> 00:10:29.466
but this trap lets me summon
some real songbirds!

00:10:29.466 --> 00:10:33.233
Swoop in, my talented trio
of Blackwing Tokens!

00:10:34.666 --> 00:10:37.533
Strike up the music,
my feathered friends!

00:10:37.533 --> 00:10:40.500
(horns playing)

00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:45.566
(singing)

00:10:45.566 --> 00:10:47.033
(Melissa)
<i>Wait a doggone minute!</i>

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:49.933
You're supposed to be
duelin', not
harmonizin'!

00:10:49.933 --> 00:10:52.100
That's enough of your
buffoolery!

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.600
You two are making a mockery of
the Friendship Cup,

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:56.033
and I won't have it!

00:10:56.033 --> 00:10:57.466
This here's a serious
tournament,

00:10:57.466 --> 00:10:59.600
and I expect you gents to act
accordingly!

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.766
Oh, we are serious.

00:11:01.766 --> 00:11:03.566
As you're about
to find out!

00:11:03.566 --> 00:11:05.633
Yuya, get ready to
make your move!

00:11:05.633 --> 00:11:09.266
(thinking)
We're closing in on
the Hall of Dominion.

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.700
(thinking)
There it is,
right ahead of us.

00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.333
We can't stop our Duel Runners

00:11:15.333 --> 00:11:17.333
because they're driving on
autopilot,

00:11:17.333 --> 00:11:20.766
but nothing can stop a duelist
from jumping off!

00:11:20.766 --> 00:11:22.133
This is it!

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:23.500
It's now or never!

00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:27.133
Go save the Council
to save our future!

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.800
I thought they might try
something like this.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.100
That is why I already took
precautionary measures.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:39.100
Aah!

00:11:42.833 --> 00:11:44.600
♪

00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:46.966
Uhh! Uhh!

00:11:46.966 --> 00:11:50.533
That pain came out of nowhere.

00:11:50.533 --> 00:11:53.433
Actually, it came from
inside your helmet.

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:56.433
I took the liberty of installing
a special chip there

00:11:56.433 --> 00:11:58.733
that can give your brain
a jolt of positrons

00:11:58.733 --> 00:12:00.366
whenever I deem it necessary.

00:12:00.366 --> 00:12:02.966
So if you even have an inkling
of doing something

00:12:02.966 --> 00:12:05.666
that I find disagreeable,

00:12:05.666 --> 00:12:09.066
a slight tap on my console
will keep you in line.

00:12:09.066 --> 00:12:11.066
Originally, I had planned
to implant

00:12:11.066 --> 00:12:13.400
a cerebral restrictor
inside your brain.

00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:17.200
But this improvisation suits me
just as well, yes.

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.033
Let's see how you respond when
I increase the charge.

00:12:21.033 --> 00:12:23.766
It should get rid of
all the silly desires

00:12:23.766 --> 00:12:26.766
to leap off your Duel Runner
and rescue the High Council.

00:12:28.333 --> 00:12:31.000
Aah!

00:12:33.833 --> 00:12:34.700
Uhh!

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.133
Hey! Yuya!

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:41.566
Jump off before
it's too late!

00:12:46.366 --> 00:12:48.133
You missed your chance!

00:12:48.133 --> 00:12:50.733
I thought you were
gonna stop Roget!

00:12:50.733 --> 00:12:52.333
Why'd you back off?

00:12:52.333 --> 00:12:55.533
Unless this was all...
a lie.

00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:57.733
(groaning)

00:12:57.733 --> 00:12:59.333
(sinister laugh)

00:12:59.333 --> 00:13:02.066
And that was only
at 50% power.

00:13:02.066 --> 00:13:05.966
I wonder what will happen
at maximum strength.

00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:08.500
Now, our research theorizes

00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.566
that your higher consciousness
will stop functioning,

00:13:11.566 --> 00:13:13.400
and you'll revert to
your primal self.

00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:15.333
Let's put that theory
to the test.

00:13:15.333 --> 00:13:18.200
Aah!

00:13:22.266 --> 00:13:23.733
Uhh!

00:13:23.733 --> 00:13:25.600
Uhh!

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.333
That was weird.

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:33.533
Huh?

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.733
Since when did my card
become a flashlight?

00:13:42.733 --> 00:13:43.666
Huh?

00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:48.466
This cannot be good.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.233
I know Moon Shadow warned us
to lay low for a while,

00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:03.900
but this is a lot lower
than I was counting on.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.900
It could be a lot worse.

00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:08.066
The morning shift had to sort
through and separate

00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:10.433
the moldy socks from
all of the sweaty socks

00:14:10.433 --> 00:14:12.966
and then scrub them
with a used toothbrush.

00:14:12.966 --> 00:14:16.100
We just have to bear it
until Sora finds Yuya.

00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:17.566
Then we can leave this dump.

00:14:17.566 --> 00:14:20.166
Right, Zuzu?

00:14:20.166 --> 00:14:22.466
Your bracelet,
it's cool.

00:14:22.466 --> 00:14:24.533
How do you make it
flash like that?

00:14:24.533 --> 00:14:25.800
I'm not doing it.

00:14:28.433 --> 00:14:32.200
This only happens when
something's up with Yuya.

00:14:36.733 --> 00:14:38.600
(groaning)

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.400
Aah!

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:43.366
Aah!

00:14:43.366 --> 00:14:45.400
Aah!

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:46.833
(groans)

00:14:48.800 --> 00:14:51.066
Yuya, you tried
to trick me!

00:14:51.066 --> 00:14:54.233
Well, this card isn't a trick!

00:14:54.233 --> 00:14:56.300
The spell catastrophe draw!

00:14:56.300 --> 00:14:59.733
It lets me get rid of my five
useless hippos!

00:14:59.733 --> 00:15:02.533
(laughing)

00:15:02.533 --> 00:15:05.366
Then I'm allowed to draw
two cards from my deck!

00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:08.800
Hyah!

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:11.800
Next, I'll use my
Scale 3 Xiangke Magician

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.000
and my scale 8
Xiangsheng Magician

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.666
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:28.233
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 4 through 7

00:15:28.233 --> 00:15:29.500
all at the same time!

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.933
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:15:32.933 --> 00:15:36.366
Carve the arc of victory!

00:15:36.366 --> 00:15:37.866
(all)
My monsters are ready!

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:39.866
So ready...

00:15:39.866 --> 00:15:42.533
to swing into action!

00:15:44.033 --> 00:15:46.166
Turn up the heat!

00:15:46.166 --> 00:15:50.766
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:15:50.766 --> 00:15:51.833
(roaring)

00:15:51.833 --> 00:15:54.800
Xiangsheng activates her
ability!

00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:57.066
She changes
one monster's level

00:15:57.066 --> 00:16:01.266
to become the same as another
monster's level.

00:16:01.266 --> 00:16:05.466
I'm changing the level of your
Bora the Spear to Level 7,

00:16:05.466 --> 00:16:08.200
the same as my Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:09.733 --> 00:16:11.500
Wait! Why are you
doing that?

00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:12.733
Just watch!

00:16:12.733 --> 00:16:15.566
Get set, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:15.566 --> 00:16:18.166
Take out Blackwing,
Bora the Spear!

00:16:18.166 --> 00:16:19.433
(all)
Attack!

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000
(roaring)

00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.566
Seriously?

00:16:23.566 --> 00:16:25.466
Our friendship is over!

00:16:25.466 --> 00:16:27.133
Show no mercy!

00:16:27.133 --> 00:16:29.933
Do not even dare leave
a single feather unsinged!

00:16:29.933 --> 00:16:30.966
(roaring)

00:16:30.966 --> 00:16:33.110
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:16:36.141 --> 00:16:38.441
(Yuya)
Show no mercy!

00:16:38.441 --> 00:16:41.741
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:16:41.741 --> 00:16:42.908
And that's not all!

00:16:42.908 --> 00:16:45.841
Odd‐Eyes' special ability
now activates!

00:16:45.841 --> 00:16:49.341
Whenever it battles a monster
that's Level 5 or higher,

00:16:49.341 --> 00:16:52.308
the damage you take
is doubled!

00:16:52.308 --> 00:16:55.641
Aah!

00:16:55.641 --> 00:16:58.041
That was one whopper
of an attack!

00:16:58.041 --> 00:16:59.608
Yuya threw me for a loop

00:16:59.608 --> 00:17:01.308
when he raised the level of
Crow's monster,

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:03.541
but now I can see
it was a savvy move!

00:17:03.541 --> 00:17:07.241
(on P. A.)It allowed his Odd‐Eyes
to deal an extra helping of
damage!

00:17:07.241 --> 00:17:08.541
<i>You know what, cowpokes?</i>

00:17:08.541 --> 00:17:10.441
Yuya was actuallyfightin'
this duel

00:17:10.441 --> 00:17:12.441
with the gravity it
deservesfrom the start!

00:17:12.441 --> 00:17:15.208
Looks like I was bellyaching
for no reason.

00:17:15.208 --> 00:17:17.041
Sorry, buckaroo.

00:17:17.041 --> 00:17:19.741
I end my turn.
Now you're up.

00:17:19.741 --> 00:17:21.708
(laughing)

00:17:21.708 --> 00:17:23.208
This is outstanding.

00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:26.574
(Roget)
Yuya is solely focused on
defeating his opponent.

00:17:26.574 --> 00:17:31.174
He's completely forgotten
about the High Council or his
friends.

00:17:31.174 --> 00:17:33.908
I really believed
we were working together.

00:17:33.908 --> 00:17:36.708
I thought that you
wanted to stop Roget.

00:17:36.708 --> 00:17:39.441
But you know what?
You're even worse than him.

00:17:39.441 --> 00:17:41.274
You betrayed me!

00:17:41.274 --> 00:17:45.308
And you made me
even more determined
than ever to crush you.

00:17:45.308 --> 00:17:48.874
That's why I'm summoning
Blackwing Calima the Haze

00:17:48.874 --> 00:17:50.974
to fire up my comeback!

00:17:50.974 --> 00:17:52.841
(roaring)

00:17:52.841 --> 00:17:55.474
Now that I have
a Blackwing on my field,

00:17:55.474 --> 00:17:57.574
I can whip up another monster,

00:17:57.574 --> 00:18:01.474
namely, Blackwing,
Gust the Backblast!

00:18:01.474 --> 00:18:03.241
(screeches)

00:18:03.241 --> 00:18:06.108
Gust the Blackbast will tune
Calima the Haze

00:18:06.108 --> 00:18:09.008
to form a new Blackwing!

00:18:09.008 --> 00:18:10.674
(whirring)

00:18:10.674 --> 00:18:14.308
You shouldn't have tried to
double‐cross me, Yuya!

00:18:17.641 --> 00:18:19.341
I Synchro Summon!

00:18:19.341 --> 00:18:20.608
Spread your wings,

00:18:20.608 --> 00:18:24.108
Assault Blackwing,
Raikiri the Rain Shower!

00:18:24.108 --> 00:18:26.574
Rain down the pain, Raikira!

00:18:26.574 --> 00:18:28.241
For each Blackwing
on my field,

00:18:28.241 --> 00:18:30.374
I can destroy one of
Yuya's cards

00:18:30.374 --> 00:18:34.408
and make him pay big time
for his treachery!

00:18:34.408 --> 00:18:35.808
(growls)

00:18:39.241 --> 00:18:42.474
Since you're out of monsters,
I can strike you directly!

00:18:44.274 --> 00:18:45.408
Uhh!

00:18:45.408 --> 00:18:46.541
Aah!

00:18:46.541 --> 00:18:48.108
Uhh!
Uhh!

00:18:49.541 --> 00:18:51.274
Now they both mean business!

00:18:51.274 --> 00:18:54.041
(on P. A.)Crow went at Yuya
like a wildcat!

00:18:54.041 --> 00:18:56.641
Looks like we've got
ourselvesa real
card‐thumper!

00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.608
You messed with
the wrong duelist!

00:18:58.608 --> 00:19:01.774
Now you'll have to deal
with the consequences!

00:19:04.041 --> 00:19:05.708
(grunting)

00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:16.541
Do you think
Yuya's in trouble?

00:19:16.541 --> 00:19:18.508
I hope not.

00:19:18.508 --> 00:19:21.208
(helicopter blades whirring)

00:19:21.208 --> 00:19:23.074
(thinking)
Yuya's acting kinda weird.

00:19:25.141 --> 00:19:26.208
My turn!

00:19:26.208 --> 00:19:28.174
My turn!
My turn!

00:19:28.174 --> 00:19:29.541
My turn!

00:19:29.541 --> 00:19:30.774
(all)
I draw!

00:19:30.774 --> 00:19:31.841
Huh?

00:19:31.841 --> 00:19:34.008
I Xyz Summon!

00:19:34.008 --> 00:19:35.174
What's up?

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.741
Yuya's dueling angry
like Yuto did.

00:19:37.741 --> 00:19:41.241
This isn't like him.

00:19:41.241 --> 00:19:43.808
Your comeback is a joke!

00:19:43.808 --> 00:19:45.941
I play Amazing Pendulum!

00:19:45.941 --> 00:19:48.674
When I don't have any cards
in my Pendulum Zone,

00:19:48.674 --> 00:19:52.008
I can get two Pendulum Cards
from my extra deck!

00:19:52.008 --> 00:19:55.008
Xiangke Magician and
Xiangsheng Magician are back

00:19:55.008 --> 00:19:58.474
to set the Pendulum Scale and
prove you're no match for me!

00:20:05.474 --> 00:20:09.441
I can once again summon monsters
simultaneously!

00:20:09.441 --> 00:20:11.141
I Pendulum Summon!

00:20:11.141 --> 00:20:13.841
Return to the front lines
to fight!

00:20:13.841 --> 00:20:16.674
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:20:16.674 --> 00:20:19.574
(roaring)

00:20:19.574 --> 00:20:23.841
Dial up his destruction,
Performapal Longphone Bull!

00:20:26.408 --> 00:20:29.141
Longphone Bull can ring up
another Performapal

00:20:29.141 --> 00:20:31.008
to join the fray!

00:20:31.008 --> 00:20:33.408
I summon Performapal
Skeeter Skimmer!

00:20:33.408 --> 00:20:35.408
Bring your sting,
Skeeter Skimmer!

00:20:38.074 --> 00:20:40.941
I overlay my two
Performapals.

00:20:40.941 --> 00:20:43.141
To create
the Overlay Network.

00:20:48.941 --> 00:20:51.141
Cloaked in shadows...

00:20:51.141 --> 00:20:53.341
And relentless
in its objective,

00:20:53.341 --> 00:20:56.708
I call upon the most
dangerous of dragons!

00:20:56.708 --> 00:20:58.508
(all)
I Xyz Summon!

00:20:58.508 --> 00:21:02.474
(Yuya)
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:21:04.874 --> 00:21:07.174
That's Yuto's dragon!

00:21:07.174 --> 00:21:09.374
Yuya may be on that Runner,

00:21:09.374 --> 00:21:12.908
but I think someone else
is in the driver's seat.
