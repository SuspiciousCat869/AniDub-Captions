WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.800
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.866
(Yuya)
Now that Gong's been knocked out
of the tournament,

00:00:06.866 --> 00:00:08.166
where's he gonna stay?

00:00:08.166 --> 00:00:09.233
Hey!

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.700
Chojiro!?
Shh!

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.233
Keep it down, Yuya.

00:00:13.233 --> 00:00:15.800
You're going to get both
of us in major trouble.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.900
I overheard some workers
shooting the breeze

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:19.633
outside my room...

00:00:19.633 --> 00:00:23.166
(man)
Once they lose, the duelists get
kicked out of their fancy digs.

00:00:23.166 --> 00:00:24.666
(man 2)
Nah, it's worse than that.

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:29.533
They're sent underground to work
in a gigantic garbage dump.

00:00:29.533 --> 00:00:30.933
(Yuya)
Gong lost his duel.

00:00:30.933 --> 00:00:33.166
Does that mean he was
sent to the refinery?

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.100
I am afraid so.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.333
(Melissa)
<i>He may be a Common,</i>

00:00:36.333 --> 00:00:38.800
but there's nothing common
about Shinji Weber.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.066
<i>He faces: Riley Akaba!</i>

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.966
(Declan)
Don't worry, Riley.
Huh?

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.100
Declan!

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.066
Everything will be okay.

00:00:49.066 --> 00:00:51.766
I'm not dueling,
and you can't make me.

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.666
If you are indeed
refusing to duel today,

00:00:55.666 --> 00:00:56.833
I would like to know why.

00:00:56.833 --> 00:00:59.666
Because my opponent is Shinji.

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.233
You are understandably
reluctant to attack

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:05.600
an opponent who
showed you kindness.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.233
Moon Shadow.

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.633
You will battle
in place of Riley.

00:01:09.633 --> 00:01:11.100
(Moon Shadow)
Of course.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.233
Your reaction today shows me
that you are finally starting

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.033
to make your own decisions.

00:01:16.033 --> 00:01:18.500
I'm pleased
by this development.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.466
You are?

00:01:20.466 --> 00:01:22.466
Mother would have a fit
if she learned

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:25.333
that you were developing
your own personality.

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:29.966
If she had her way, Riley would
remain an empty shell forever.

(Melissa)
<i>What in tarnation?</i>

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.166
Who's this Moon
Shadow fella?

00:02:36.166 --> 00:02:38.266
And why's he
replacin' Riley?

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:40.666
<i>And why'd nobody tell me?</i>

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:43.666
(crowd muttering)

00:02:46.333 --> 00:02:50.233
Well, it appears that, uh,
for some reason,

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:53.700
there's been
a last‐minute switcheroo.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.933
Typical Topsider maneuver.

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:59.233
Bending the rules to do whatever
they want, whenever they want.

00:02:59.233 --> 00:03:03.133
You think handpicking an
opponent is gonna work?!

00:03:03.133 --> 00:03:05.000
Well, this Common's
here to tell ya

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.366
that the only thing
you picked was a fight!

00:03:07.366 --> 00:03:09.633
My, how primitive.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:11.666
What do you expect
from a "Common"?

00:03:11.666 --> 00:03:14.500
Listen, we have
to stand up for ourselves!

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.400
It's time we stopped
letting Topsiders

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.300
rewrite the rules
on duels and on life!

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.566
But we have no one to blame
but ourselves.

00:03:22.566 --> 00:03:24.666
We let Topsiders
run all over us!

00:03:24.666 --> 00:03:29.900
(crowd mutters and boos)

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.800
That is not the way
to win over the crowd.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.000
These fine folks didn't pay
top dollar to hear you
holler!

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.466
You can boo me all you want,

00:03:38.466 --> 00:03:41.166
but that won't stop me from
telling it like it is.

00:03:41.166 --> 00:03:43.533
Topsiders have been
treating us like garbage

00:03:43.533 --> 00:03:45.233
ever since I
can remember.

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:47.966
And we Commons have
sat by and let them.

00:03:47.966 --> 00:03:49.533
They've trashed
our dreams.

00:03:49.533 --> 00:03:52.300
All you sheep might be okay
with that,

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.100
but I for one am going to
take back my future.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:58.066
I'm going to turn
their world upside down.

00:03:58.066 --> 00:03:59.800
Gosh!

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:01.133
<i>Take a look around.</i>

00:04:01.133 --> 00:04:04.566
This crowd's come together as
one to have some fun.

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:06.266
And that's
just what they were doin'

00:04:06.266 --> 00:04:08.300
'til you decided
to shout and pout!

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.700
Instead of turnin' the world
upside down,

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.533
how 'bout turnin'
that frown around?!

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:15.966
Shinji, if you want the crowd
to hate you,

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:18.300
you're doing a great job.

00:04:23.466 --> 00:04:25.066
(Declan)
Riley, stay here.

00:04:25.066 --> 00:04:26.366
I have to take care
of a minor problem.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.300
(Riley)
Problem?

00:04:37.633 --> 00:04:38.966
(Declan)
You called for me.

00:04:40.566 --> 00:04:43.100
(Riley)
I hope this isn't 'cause of me.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.100
(Melissa)
Now let's remember, y'all,
that the City is one,

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.500
and we're here
to have fun!

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.366
So, let's act like it
as we sit back

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:53.200
and watch the Friendship Cup
kick into overdrive!

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.100
I understand
that you aren't pleased

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.100
with the change to today's
duel matchup.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.166
I assure you it's for
the best of the tournament.

00:05:00.166 --> 00:05:01.433
(Gray)
It had better be.

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:02.833
(Declan)
There is no need to worry.

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:04.833
You will still get to see
another Lancer

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:06.333
showcase their abilities.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:09.233
Moon Shadow has considerable
battle experience.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.433
His skills rival,
if not surpass

00:05:11.433 --> 00:05:14.166
any Lancer we have,
he will not disappoint.

00:05:14.166 --> 00:05:19.166
Does Declan think Moon Shadow
is a better duelist than I am?

00:05:21.466 --> 00:05:23.133
<i>Y'all ready to duel?!</i>

00:05:23.133 --> 00:05:26.400
Fire up the Action Field
Crossover Acceleration!

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.566
(computer voice)
<i>Action cards dispersed.</i>

00:05:31.566 --> 00:05:35.233
(Melissa)
On your marks,
get set, go!

00:05:37.466 --> 00:05:38.666
(both)
Let's duel!

00:05:41.566 --> 00:05:43.500
(Yuya)
Man, one of them is gonna lose,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.466
and that means one of 'em's
gonna get sent

00:05:45.466 --> 00:05:47.733
to that garbage dump
underground.

00:05:47.733 --> 00:05:49.333
(Riley)
If Moon Shadow wins,

00:05:49.333 --> 00:05:51.733
does that mean Declan
won't need me anymore?

00:05:51.733 --> 00:05:54.333
Someone is going to fall today,

00:05:54.333 --> 00:05:58.266
so, now it's just a question
of how hard and how fast.

00:06:03.766 --> 00:06:06.400
(Melissa)Both duelists are
heading into the first turn, but
it looks

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.100
like Moon Shadow's leavin'
Shinji in his rearview
mirror.

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.600
(Moon Shadow)
It is my turn
and with that honor

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.833
I summon
Twilight Ninja Shingetsu.

00:06:17.766 --> 00:06:19.800
Then I will activate the spell

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:22.500
Illusion Ninjitsu
Art of Hazy Shuriken.

00:06:24.466 --> 00:06:27.633
By sending the Action Card
I just acquired to my graveyard,

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:30.566
I will now deal you
300 points of damage.

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:32.100
Feel the strike of the ninja!

00:06:36.133 --> 00:06:38.133
Wasting a card
for 300 points?

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:40.433
A ninja,
how thrilling!

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:42.300
He's ninjatastic!

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.600
Bravo!

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000
(Moon Shadow)
Another Action Card.

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:48.800
And another 300 points
of damage.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.833
And again!

00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.466
Moon Shadow's hittin 'em
harderthan a frozen crawdad.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:06.366
I'm shelving those
throwing stars.

00:07:14.333 --> 00:07:17.100
With that sudden shot of
speed Shinji's stopped Moon
Shadow

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:18.633
from pickin' up
an Action Card.

00:07:18.633 --> 00:07:20.766
You may have silenced
my moves,

00:07:20.766 --> 00:07:22.833
but the damage
I have done rings loud.

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:28.266
(Melissa)
Shinji's already taken some
serious damage.

00:07:28.266 --> 00:07:30.633
Now let's see
if he can dish some out!

00:07:30.633 --> 00:07:33.333
I've been an underdog
since the day I was born,

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.366
but underdogs know how to bite.

00:07:35.366 --> 00:07:36.700
It's my move!

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.733
I summon Battlewasp
Arbalest the Rapidfire.

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:44.700
Buzz'em.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.400
Still grabbing
Action Cards?

00:07:48.400 --> 00:07:50.300
Grab as many
as you like.

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.533
I'm still gonna
knock you around ninjerk.

00:07:52.533 --> 00:07:54.666
Arbalest, attack his Ninja!

00:07:56.466 --> 00:08:00.300
(Moon Shadow)
I activate the trap Illusion
Ninjitsu Art of Hazy Toad.

00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.900
By sending this Action Card
to the graveyard,

00:08:02.900 --> 00:08:05.400
my Ninja gains
1000 attack points.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:08.166
Your stinger will now be stung.

00:08:11.666 --> 00:08:13.833
(Melissa)
<i>Un‐bee‐lievable.</i>

00:08:15.933 --> 00:08:17.800
You might think
that's a nice move,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.933
but when an Arbalest
is destroyed,

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.500
I can summon another Arbalest
from my hand.

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.900
I see.

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.433
Your monsters
act like a swarm.

00:08:27.433 --> 00:08:30.466
When one bee falls, another
flies in to take its place.

00:08:30.466 --> 00:08:33.166
My bees are like us Commons,
always working together

00:08:33.166 --> 00:08:36.366
to make surethe
hive survives.

00:08:36.366 --> 00:08:37.766
He's right!

00:08:37.766 --> 00:08:41.066
We Commons have always pitched
in to protect one another.

00:08:41.066 --> 00:08:43.100
(Moon Shadow)
Now that the battle is over,

00:08:43.100 --> 00:08:47.866
Shingetsu's attack
points return to normal.

00:08:47.866 --> 00:08:49.933
Well, I'm finished
with all of my moves.

00:08:49.933 --> 00:08:52.066
You speak of
the strength of your people.

00:08:52.066 --> 00:08:55.500
Well, let us put to the test
your own resolve‐‐ My turn!

00:08:56.566 --> 00:08:59.200
If he wins, I lose.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:03.433
(Moon Shadow)
I activate the spell Ninjitsu
Art of Hazy Duplication

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:06.100
to call upon a Ninja
to fight by my side.

00:09:07.366 --> 00:09:11.333
If Moon Shadow wins this duel,
then Declan...

00:09:11.333 --> 00:09:13.066
will turn his back on me.

00:09:13.066 --> 00:09:15.566
I'll be all alone again.

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:21.433
Duplicate yourself
Twilight Ninja Shingetsu.

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:24.333
Clone as many copies of that
clown as you want.

00:09:24.333 --> 00:09:26.033
None can defeat my Arbalest.

00:09:26.033 --> 00:09:28.400
Your words would have weight
if I were to attack,

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:29.766
but I will not.

00:09:29.766 --> 00:09:32.866
I tribute my second Shingetsu
so that I can summon

00:09:32.866 --> 00:09:36.033
Twilight Ninja Nichirin,
the Chunin.

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:38.266
Not unlike your
swarm of brothers,

00:09:38.266 --> 00:09:39.666
when a ninja is in need,

00:09:39.666 --> 00:09:43.300
his clan springs into action
with the swiftness of the wind.

00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:45.866
Nichirin, slice down Arbalest.

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:53.000
(Melissa)
Moon Shadow's buckin'
like a bronco,

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.433
throwin' Shinji
for a loop!

00:09:54.433 --> 00:09:57.266
Shinji'll have to strike back
hard or he'll lose this duel

00:09:57.266 --> 00:09:59.533
faster than a jack rabbit
on jet skates!

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:01.633
Like that changes anything.

00:10:01.633 --> 00:10:03.800
When Arbalest
is destroyed,

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.866
I can summon another
Arbalest the Rapidfire.

00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:13.900
I end my turn.

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.400
Strike one Battlewasp down
and another will take its place.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:19.033
Because they represent
us Commons,

00:10:19.033 --> 00:10:20.700
and we never back down.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.600
Oh!

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.566
You hear that Topsiders?

00:10:24.566 --> 00:10:26.433
You'll never break
our spirit.

00:10:26.433 --> 00:10:27.666
And neither will you.

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:31.566
I am not here
to break anything.

00:10:31.566 --> 00:10:34.133
Topsiders never had
to fight to survive.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.633
They treat everything
like trash.

00:10:35.633 --> 00:10:37.200
And we're sick of it!

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:41.200
It's time for Topsiders
to feel the sting

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.033
of what it's like
to live like a Common.

00:10:44.033 --> 00:10:47.900
I summon the Tuner Monster
Battlewasp Sting the Poison!

00:10:50.266 --> 00:10:52.766
Level 2 Battlewasp
Sting the Poison

00:10:52.766 --> 00:10:55.666
tunes with my Level 4 Arbalest
the Rapidfire.

00:10:58.533 --> 00:11:01.466
Beat your wings,
bring your stings.

00:11:01.466 --> 00:11:02.633
Unite and fight!

00:11:05.666 --> 00:11:07.133
I Synchro Summon...

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:09.166
Battlewasp Halberd
the Charge!

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.566
(Melissa)
Now that's one critter
who could give

00:11:12.566 --> 00:11:14.633
a horsefly a run
for its money.

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:16.633
(Shinji)
<i>Halberd the Charge,</i>

00:11:16.633 --> 00:11:18.866
take out his Ninja!

00:11:18.866 --> 00:11:20.700
Do not "bee"
so sure.

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.300
I grabbed another Action Card so
that I can activate Hazy Toad.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:29.800
I send that Card
to the graveyard

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:32.466
to increase Shingetsu's
attack points.

00:11:32.466 --> 00:11:34.733
If you think that's going to
stop my swarm

00:11:34.733 --> 00:11:36.133
you've got another thing coming.

00:11:36.133 --> 00:11:37.666
Halberd's Special Ability

00:11:37.666 --> 00:11:39.866
slashes your monster's
attack points in half.

00:11:39.866 --> 00:11:40.933
What?

00:11:45.466 --> 00:11:48.966
(Melissa)
Well pour me on turkey
and call me gravy.

00:11:48.966 --> 00:11:52.400
Shinji just cut Moon Shadow a
big ol' piece of humble pie.

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.166
You raised your Twilight Ninja
Shingetsu's attack points

00:11:56.166 --> 00:11:59.333
to stop me, but it backfired and
you took extra damage instead.

00:12:01.266 --> 00:12:04.200
Topsiders everywhere should take
what just happened to you

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:06.600
as a sign of what's
coming for all of them.

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:08.900
The higher you put yourselves
above us,

00:12:08.900 --> 00:12:11.600
the farther and harder
you're going to fall.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.566
Is that lowly Common
still jabbering on?
Beats me.

00:12:15.566 --> 00:12:17.966
Now hold your horses
and watch your tongue.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:20.933
Talkin' trash to the audience
is a no‐no.

00:12:20.933 --> 00:12:22.566
This here duelin'
tournament's not called

00:12:22.566 --> 00:12:25.500
the Friendship Cup
for nothing now, is it?

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.833
She is right.

00:12:26.833 --> 00:12:29.900
Do not treat your Duel Runner
as a perch for anger.

00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:30.833
Just duel.

00:12:32.166 --> 00:12:34.400
Aren't ninja's
supposed to be silent?

00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:36.966
Guess ninja training isn't what
it used to be.

00:12:36.966 --> 00:12:40.333
Nowadays anyone can put on a
mask and be someone's puppet.

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:43.966
Yeah, that's right you ninjas
have no honor whatsoever.

00:12:43.966 --> 00:12:46.166
You just do whatever
people tell you to do.

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:47.600
How dare you?

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.166
How dare you
disrespect the ninja.

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:53.800
I've never seen Moon Shadow
so angry before.

00:12:53.800 --> 00:12:55.566
Ninja's are not puppets.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:56.733
Nobody controls us.

00:12:56.733 --> 00:12:58.500
We act only
as we desire.

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500
You can beat him, Shinji.

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.933
And right now,
my desire is to unleash

00:13:02.933 --> 00:13:05.133
the devastating power
of the ninja!

00:13:08.666 --> 00:13:11.433
Ninjas are not puppets.
Nobody controls us.

00:13:11.433 --> 00:13:13.666
We act only as we desire.

00:13:13.666 --> 00:13:16.600
You have insulted me
and my whole ninja clan.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.600
For that I will show no mercy.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:23.233
I tribute Twilight Ninja
Nichirin, the Chunin!

00:13:23.233 --> 00:13:25.933
This will mark
the beginning of your end.

00:13:25.933 --> 00:13:27.900
I summon the greatest ninja
of them all,

00:13:27.900 --> 00:13:30.266
Twilight Ninja
Getsuga, the Shogun.

00:13:37.666 --> 00:13:39.700
I look forward
to taking it out.

00:13:39.700 --> 00:13:42.366
(Moon Shadow)
You may try but you will fail.

00:13:42.366 --> 00:13:44.666
By switching Twilight Ninja
Getsuga, the Shogun

00:13:44.666 --> 00:13:46.033
into defense mode,

00:13:46.033 --> 00:13:49.866
I can bring back two
Twilight Ninja Shingetsus.

00:13:49.866 --> 00:13:53.300
Now return under
your leader's banner!

00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:56.433
And Shingetsus protect their
fellow ninjas,

00:13:56.433 --> 00:14:00.200
preventing you
from attacking them at all.

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:03.200
Shinji's in a tougher fix
than a pig at a luau.

00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:06.133
With those two Ninjas on the
field, his hands are tied.

00:14:06.133 --> 00:14:07.433
Ah, that's great...

00:14:07.433 --> 00:14:08.800
And even if he
finds a way

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:10.966
to get rid of those
two Shingetsus,

00:14:10.966 --> 00:14:13.566
he'll have to tussle with
the muscle of a monster

00:14:13.566 --> 00:14:16.733
that's got 3000
defense points!

00:14:16.733 --> 00:14:19.066
Moon Shadow's strategy
is more than powerful,

00:14:19.066 --> 00:14:20.566
<i>it seems invincible!</i>

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:22.233
What can
Shinji do?!

00:14:22.233 --> 00:14:24.900
'Specially now that Moon
Shadow's back to his old
tricks

00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.766
<i>grabbing an Action Card.</i>

00:14:26.766 --> 00:14:29.366
I will continue
to use Hazy Shuriken

00:14:29.366 --> 00:14:31.233
to whittle away your
life points.

00:14:31.233 --> 00:14:33.466
By sending the card I picked up
to the graveyard,

00:14:33.466 --> 00:14:35.533
you are dealt
300 points of damage.

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:39.200
This is getting
kind of old.

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:43.800
The odds are stacked against me,

00:14:43.800 --> 00:14:45.933
just like
they've always been.

00:14:47.766 --> 00:14:49.333
This building's coming down,

00:14:49.333 --> 00:14:51.933
so I suggest you all pack
your bags and hit the road

00:14:51.933 --> 00:14:54.766
before you
get demo'd along with it.

00:14:54.766 --> 00:14:57.733
(Shinji)
When I was just a kid,
the only home I ever knew

00:14:57.733 --> 00:15:01.900
was torn down, and I had to
survive on the streets.

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:07.000
Your story is one of sadness.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.366
I feel your pain,

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.733
but that does mean that I am
letting you win the duel.

00:15:14.033 --> 00:15:14.966
Ugh, stop it!

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:17.300
(Moon Shadow)
And again!

00:15:19.633 --> 00:15:22.266
Don't throw these cards
away like they're trash.

00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.133
(Shinji)
I remember when I dueled this
snotty nosed Topsider as a kid.

00:15:28.133 --> 00:15:31.033
You tried to beat me
with this junk?

00:15:31.033 --> 00:15:33.600
Come back when you
get some real cards.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.466
But since you're a Common,
that'll be never.

00:15:36.466 --> 00:15:38.200
(sarcastic laugh)

00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.566
Topsiders would try to knock me
down over and over,

00:15:41.566 --> 00:15:44.600
but I would get
right back up again and again.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.900
<i>I never backed down!</i>

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:51.533
Shinji's gone through a lot,
no wonder he duels so hard.

00:15:51.533 --> 00:15:54.300
(Commons man)
It's time we stand up
for ourselves!

00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:56.800
(Commons woman)
He's right, Topsiders
trash us all!

00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:58.333
(Commons man 2)
You tell 'em, Shinji!

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:00.400
(Commons man 3)
If he can fight, so can we.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:01.966
We can't keep
going on like this!

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:07.200
(Shinji)
Every day, every year,
every moment

00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:10.166
these Topsiders treated me
as if I was trash.

00:16:10.166 --> 00:16:12.033
As if we were alltrash!

00:16:12.033 --> 00:16:13.566
<i>I say "no more."</i>

00:16:13.566 --> 00:16:16.966
If we stand together, we can
take these Topsiders down.

00:16:16.966 --> 00:16:20.200
I no longer just want to
survive, I want to live!

00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:22.200
(crowd cheering)

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:24.500
Stand! Raise your fists high!

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.366
Rise up as one!

00:16:30.366 --> 00:16:32.633
We must unite and fight!

00:16:32.633 --> 00:16:34.133
Unite and fight!

00:16:34.133 --> 00:16:36.933
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:36.933 --> 00:16:40.066
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:42.200
Unite and fight,
unit and fight...

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:47.533
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:50.300
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:50.300 --> 00:16:53.200
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.233
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:56.233 --> 00:16:59.200
Unite and fight,
unit and fight!

00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.033
Unite and fight,
unit and fight...

00:17:07.266 --> 00:17:10.233
(Moon Shadow)
Your speeches won't change
the outcome of this duel.

00:17:10.233 --> 00:17:11.866
My strategy is perfect.

00:17:11.866 --> 00:17:14.066
I will not break that
which is not broken,

00:17:14.066 --> 00:17:16.400
especially since
it will break you!

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.933
Not this time.

00:17:17.933 --> 00:17:20.633
I activate the
Action Spell Stand Up.

00:17:20.633 --> 00:17:22.166
Sling all the stars you want,

00:17:22.166 --> 00:17:24.733
but it won't slice
through this shield.

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.966
Looks like you're
outnumbered, ninja.

00:17:28.966 --> 00:17:30.400
What did you say?

00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:32.833
See, you're not just
dueling me anymore,

00:17:32.833 --> 00:17:35.333
you're dueling
all us Commons together.

00:17:35.333 --> 00:17:38.166
Now's our chance
to unite and fight.

00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:40.800
(crowd cheering)

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.266
We draw!

00:17:42.266 --> 00:17:44.666
(all)
Draw!

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:51.266
We draw.

00:17:51.266 --> 00:17:53.800
(all)
Draw!

00:17:55.733 --> 00:17:57.966
Together, we will win
this battle.

00:17:57.966 --> 00:18:00.000
Together we will make a change.

00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:03.600
(cheering)

00:18:05.333 --> 00:18:08.433
We activate the spell
Summoning Swarm.

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:10.400
It lets me summon a Battlewasp

00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.666
from my graveyard for every
monster on your field.

00:18:13.666 --> 00:18:18.300
You have three monsters out,
so I'll bring back two Arbalests

00:18:18.300 --> 00:18:22.033
and the Tuner Monster Sting
the Poison from my graveyard.

00:18:27.133 --> 00:18:30.000
(cheering)

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.933
(chanting "Shinji, Shinji")

00:18:34.533 --> 00:18:36.566
Shinji, Shinji!

00:18:39.166 --> 00:18:41.133
Shinji, Shinji!

00:18:56.900 --> 00:18:59.233
(administration staff)
The crowd is getting
out of hand, sir.

00:18:59.233 --> 00:19:01.433
We don't have enough Security
to deal with this.

00:19:01.433 --> 00:19:03.600
No need to worry.

00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:06.466
Let these Commons
have their fun.

00:19:06.466 --> 00:19:08.666
It won't last forever.

00:19:08.666 --> 00:19:12.866
Shinji's got this crowd
all riled up.

00:19:12.866 --> 00:19:15.966
Now for Sting the Poison's
Special Ability.

00:19:15.966 --> 00:19:17.900
By tributing a Battlewasp,

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:21.933
your Twilight Ninja Shingetsu
loses its special abilities.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.266
That means we're allowed
to attack you.

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:29.666
Arbalest, sting away.

00:19:33.966 --> 00:19:37.533
Halberd, slice and dice
the other Shingetsu.

00:19:41.633 --> 00:19:45.366
My Shogun has 3000 defense
points, so you cannot hurt me.

00:19:45.366 --> 00:19:48.033
Not a problem, not with this:

00:19:48.033 --> 00:19:51.566
the trap Urgent Tuning
lets me Synchro Summon

00:19:51.566 --> 00:19:53.266
even during the battle.

00:19:53.266 --> 00:19:54.433
No!

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:57.300
Sting the Poison tunes
Halberd the Charge

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.766
and Arbalest the Rapidfire.

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:07.766
Let's show these Topsiders
we know how to bring the sting.

00:20:09.766 --> 00:20:12.266
We Synchro Summon!

00:20:12.266 --> 00:20:15.933
Level 12 Battlewasp,
Ballista the Armageddon!

00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:27.666
Now, we activate
its Special Ability.

00:20:30.433 --> 00:20:33.966
For every Battlewasp that
I banish from the graveyard,

00:20:33.966 --> 00:20:38.633
your monster loses 500 attack
and defense points.

00:20:38.633 --> 00:20:41.166
Since we're banishing
five Battlewasps,

00:20:41.166 --> 00:20:43.233
Twilight Ninja
Getsuga, the Shogun

00:20:43.233 --> 00:20:46.633
loses a total of 2500
defense points.

00:20:46.633 --> 00:20:48.166
Now's your chance to beat him.

00:20:48.166 --> 00:20:49.933
Ballista the Armageddon,

00:20:49.933 --> 00:20:52.566
attack Twilight Ninja Getsuga,
the Shogun!

00:20:54.866 --> 00:20:58.600
And here's the stinger,
Ballista still deals you damage

00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.933
even if your monster
is in defense mode.

00:21:09.700 --> 00:21:12.533
(Moon Shadow)
No!

00:21:17.500 --> 00:21:20.066
(Melissa)
The winner of today's
second match

00:21:20.066 --> 00:21:24.133
is the ornery
upstart Shinji Weber!

00:21:24.133 --> 00:21:26.400
Don't waste time
celebrating.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:30.000
Focus your energy on making a
change in New Domino City.

00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.266
<i>Rise up, unite and fight!</i>

00:21:34.266 --> 00:21:37.866
Maybe things are finally
gonna change.

00:21:37.866 --> 00:21:40.100
I hope for the better.

00:21:47.966 --> 00:21:50.100
(Melissa) This was
more than just a duel.

00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.733
It downright feels like the
start of a, a rebellion.

00:21:53.733 --> 00:21:55.733
That was rather overstated.

00:21:55.733 --> 00:21:58.666
The Commons are just letting
off a little steam.

00:21:58.666 --> 00:22:01.600
There's absolutely
nothing to worry about.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.266
Wouldn't you agree?

00:22:04.266 --> 00:22:06.833
(Gray)
Your Lancer's have now
lost three in a row.

00:22:06.833 --> 00:22:09.000
(Declan)
Yes, now Moon Shadow
will be sent

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.666
to the underground
waste refinery.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:16.233
Just as I planned all along.
