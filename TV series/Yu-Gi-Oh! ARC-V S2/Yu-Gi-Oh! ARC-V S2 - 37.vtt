(Melissa, on P. A.)This has been
one hot humdinger of a duel!

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.033
Like when Yugo was about to grab
an Action Card

only to have the course change
on him at the last second!

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.333
But he came back
and summoned

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.333
his big ol' Clear Wing
Synchro Dragon

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:18.400

It felt like I was
dueling Celina for real.

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:46.933
Or... was... the entire thing
all just in my imagination?

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:48.400
Maybe being stuck in here

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.700
has got my mind
playing tricks on me.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.566
No, because this wasn't
the first time

00:03:53.566 --> 00:03:57.166
me and Yugo's brains
got crosswired.

00:03:57.166 --> 00:03:59.866
But if what I saw was true...

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.066
Celina's heading
to the underground!

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:04.666
Unless Roget
gets to her first,

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:07.266
and that's even worse news!

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:08.666

00:04:08.666 --> 00:04:11.866

most beneficial

00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.133
to have someone
of that caliber

00:17:28.133 --> 00:17:29.400
battling on our side.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.100
Yes, Declan is a worthy ally,
one whose support

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.866
we would be fools
to turn away from,

00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:35.533
especially
after this display.

00:17:35.533 --> 00:17:38.500
Let us not be rash
and rush to any decisions.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.800
Correct, Presider?

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.000
Yes.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.466
But in the battle
between Roget and Declan,

00:17:44.466 --> 00:17:48.266
I'd say Akaba has just
taken a decisive lead.

00:17:48.266 --> 00:17:50.266
(Declan)
Judging by
how angry you are,

00:17:50.266 --> 00:17:51.766
Riley's mission
was a success

00:17:51.766 --> 00:17:54.200
and Celina
is safe and sound.

00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:57.433
I'll never allow you
to have Celina or Zuzu.

00:17:57.433 --> 00:18:00.533
Any more brilliant plans
you'd like me to ruin?

00:18:00.533 --> 00:18:04.400
So then, you've got Zuzu
safely tucked away as well?

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:05.966
I'm warning you, Declan.

00:18:05.966 --> 00:18:08.566
In New Domino City,
I am the law.

00:18:08.566 --> 00:18:11.700
And no matter what you do,
I promise I'll use my power

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.800
to make sure I get
exactly what I want!

00:18:15.066 --> 00:18:16.833
Have you fixed Sergey's
cerebral restrictor yet?

00:18:16.833 --> 00:18:17.866
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:18:17.866 --> 00:18:19.266
And I've amped up
the voltage,

00:18:19.266 --> 00:18:22.266
so it's 87% more
effective than before.

00:18:22.266 --> 00:18:25.200
He should obey you
all the time now.

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.933
Should? It better be!

00:18:26.933 --> 00:18:28.100
Now wake him up

00:18:28.100 --> 00:18:30.100
and send him
to the Council Building!

00:18:30.100 --> 00:18:31.366
And tell him
to bring me Declan!

00:18:31.366 --> 00:18:32.366
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:18:34.666 --> 00:18:38.633
(thinking)
Declan, you can't hide
Zuzu and Celina from me.

00:18:38.633 --> 00:18:41.900
Sergey and Security will force
that information out of you,

00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.600
one way or another.

00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:47.333
But sending out Security
like this

00:18:47.333 --> 00:18:50.066
may make
the citizens uncomfortable.

00:18:50.066 --> 00:18:52.000
I'll make sure
they're distracted

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:54.233
by the Friendship Cup.

00:18:54.233 --> 00:18:56.000
Ladies and gentlemen,

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.833
I have
a super‐surprise announcement

00:18:57.833 --> 00:18:59.266

00:18:59.266 --> 00:19:02.933

in New Domino City!

00:19:02.933 --> 00:19:05.200
Just sit tight
in your saddles.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.100
Director Roget's made

00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:12.066

This is

A duel after dark

There's no way
I'm missing this!

Man, I never thought

00:19:24.366 --> 00:19:25.833

a semi‐final match

00:19:25.833 --> 00:19:27.233

Odd‐Eyes,

but what's the big rush?

00:20:26.266 --> 00:20:28.600
Somebody gotta catch a train

Don't ask me.
