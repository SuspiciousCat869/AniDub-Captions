00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.866
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:04.866 --> 00:00:08.500
Sorry I hadn't had the
opportunity to welcome you two.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.800
So, how about I make it up to
you with a very special offer?

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.800
You two beat every one
of my boys here in a duel,

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.433
and I'll see about sending you
back above ground.

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:19.233
Even in a mountain of junk,

00:00:19.233 --> 00:00:21.900
sometimes you can find
a hidden gem.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.300
What happens
when you find them?!

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.866
(Lucas Swank)
I take them
straight to the boss,

00:00:25.866 --> 00:00:30.200
the Director of Security,
Jean Michel Roget.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.500
Oh.
Mmm.
Ah.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.633
You know that duelist they call
Sergei from the Friendship Cup?

00:00:35.633 --> 00:00:37.100
He's one of the discoveries

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.533
I presented as a gift
to Mr. Roget.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.633
(Melissa)
Please stand up
and stomp your spurs

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:47.266
for New Domino's Damon
Lopez... and Sergei Volkoff!

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:48.866
Sergei's brain
is all bot,

00:00:48.866 --> 00:00:50.666
but his brawn's
flesh and bones?

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:55.366
(Lucas Swank)
He's programmed to destroy
every duelist like a machine.

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:58.700
It's like he has a technology
that's out of this world.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.333
Uhh!

00:01:00.333 --> 00:01:03.166
(Declan)
If what you heard
is correct,

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:05.366
then Roget must
have come from...

00:01:05.366 --> 00:01:07.533
Duel Academy in
the Fusion Dimension.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.933
Huh?

00:01:08.933 --> 00:01:11.633
Continue gathering
information from underground.

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:14.266
Report back to me how
the Lancers are doing.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.733
I will.

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.733
(Melissa)
In a dramatic
come‐from‐behind victory,

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:22.366
Damon is out, and the winner
is the Duelin' Destroyer,

00:01:22.366 --> 00:01:24.133
<i>Sergei Volkoff!</i>

00:01:24.133 --> 00:01:25.433
(Yuya)
Damon?

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:27.400
Another duelist
sent away to work

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.633
in the underground.

(Melissa)
<i>Yes, siree, cowpokes,</i>

00:02:32.866 --> 00:02:35.233
we've reached the last duel
of the first round!

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:38.833
Give it up for that broodin'
bad boy, Shay Obsidian...
(crowd cheering)

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:43.200
and his red‐headed rival,
Dennis McField!

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.833
♪

00:02:50.233 --> 00:02:52.066
(Shay)
You're hiding something, Dennis.

00:02:54.733 --> 00:02:58.133
You're not as incompetent as
the other Leo duelists I faced.

00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.766
Are you really from Leo?

00:02:59.766 --> 00:03:01.166
Of course.

00:03:01.166 --> 00:03:03.900
They don't teach the kind
of strategies Dennis used

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.600
at the Leo Institute.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.666
So then the question is...

00:03:07.666 --> 00:03:10.533
if he's not a Leo student,
then where's he from?

00:03:10.533 --> 00:03:13.266
I'm not sure Shay was
buying what I was trying

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:15.666
to sell in our last duel.

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:18.333
I'm afraid he might be
sniffin' up the right tree...

00:03:18.333 --> 00:03:21.466
so I've gotta do whatever it
takes to shake him off my tail!

00:03:21.466 --> 00:03:23.566
If this was a normal duel,

00:03:23.566 --> 00:03:25.966
I'd be psyched
to see two friends go at it...

00:03:25.966 --> 00:03:27.200
but this time,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.233
the loser's taking
a one‐way trip underground.

00:03:30.233 --> 00:03:32.300
It must be disappointing

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.500
to see your two Lancers
battle each other?

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:37.266
But that is the way
it has been decided.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:39.200
Correct, Presider?

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.466
Mmm.
Indeed!

00:03:41.466 --> 00:03:43.800
(Declan)
I have no objections,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.433
because this duel will be
quite enlightening.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:48.100
(Gale)
Really?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.766
(electronic pulsing)

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:53.933
(engine running)

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.400
(man)
Bust it open, Shay!
(crowd cheering)

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.966
(man 2)
He's riding high, and the battle
hasn't even started yet!

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.766
(Melissa)
Shay burst onto the scene in
the underground duel circuit,

00:04:00.766 --> 00:04:02.933
just like he burst
into this stadium,

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:06.133
and he's gonna get a heap o'
trouble from his opponent,

00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:12.300
New Domino City's now famous
street artiste, Dennis
McField!

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.000
I'm on a quest to make this the
most dramatic duel ever seen,

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.466
with a deck full of surprises...

00:04:19.466 --> 00:04:21.600
that'll blow you away!

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.933
(cheering)

00:04:26.266 --> 00:04:27.900
(man)
Dennis rules!

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.666
(Melissa)
Hold on to your saddles,
ladies and gents!

00:04:30.666 --> 00:04:32.500
This is gonna be
a duelapalooza

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.433
the likes of which this
here city's never seen!

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:37.100
<i>I don't know about you,</i>

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:39.500
but I for one don't wanna
missa single move!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.266
Why, I feel as charged up
as a family of mice

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.666
let loose in a
cheese factory!

00:04:44.666 --> 00:04:46.600
Let's forget
that you and I are buds

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.933
till this shindig
is over, okay?

00:04:48.933 --> 00:04:51.766
Hmm. You don't have
to worry aboutthat.

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:53.866
This is war, Dennis.

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:55.200
Easy, guy.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:56.533
Don't take it too far!

00:04:56.533 --> 00:04:58.166
<i>Y'all ready?</i>

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.366
<i>Away we go!</i>

00:05:00.366 --> 00:05:03.833
Fire up the
Action Field...

00:05:03.833 --> 00:05:06.466
<i>Crossover Acceleration!</i>

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:07.800
(computer voice)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.333
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:05:10.333 --> 00:05:12.366
(horn honks)

00:05:12.366 --> 00:05:14.133
(beeps)

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:15.866
(Melissa)
<i>The clock is tickin'...</i>

00:05:15.866 --> 00:05:17.566
so you better
get kickin'!

00:05:19.833 --> 00:05:20.966
(both)
Let's duel!

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.333
Time to learn
who you really are.

00:05:29.333 --> 00:05:31.400
Time to pull the sheet
off of this sham

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:32.700
you're trying to sell me.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.933
(Melissa) By jiminy,
Shay wasted no time

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:36.700
seizing control
of this turbofest,

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.666
so now he gets
to go first!

00:05:38.666 --> 00:05:42.333
I'll lead off by summoning
Raidraptor Skull Eagle!

00:05:42.333 --> 00:05:43.500
Take flight!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.133
Next I'm activating
the spell Raidraptor Call!

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:57.233
This'll let me summon a second
Raidraptor Skull Eagle!

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:02.000
And now I'll build
the Overlay Network

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.666
with my two Skull Eagles!

00:06:05.833 --> 00:06:06.933
(blasts)

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.033
I Xyz Summon!

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:11.200
Raidraptor Fiend Eagle!

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.500
(roars)

00:06:14.566 --> 00:06:16.333
(Melissa) Folks, I'm
no birdwatcher,

00:06:16.333 --> 00:06:20.466
but if you ask me, that's one
ferocious lookin' fowl!

00:06:20.466 --> 00:06:22.033
This is when the fun starts!

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:24.600
Thanks to my Skull Eagle's
special abilities,

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.500
my Fiend Eagle's attack
points soar to 1,600!

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.133
(beeping)

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:34.900
Finally, I activate Fiend
Eagle's special ability!

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.833
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:06:36.833 --> 00:06:39.800
you take damage equal
to my Eagle's attack points!

00:06:42.666 --> 00:06:45.666
(Melissa)
Yowch! Dennis took a heap
of damage!

00:06:45.666 --> 00:06:47.333
Up to your old tricks,
I see.

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:49.066
What do you mean
"old" tricks?

00:06:49.066 --> 00:06:51.100
I've seen all these moves
before!

00:06:51.100 --> 00:06:53.300
Next your gonna use
a Rank‐Up Magic card

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.333
just like last time we dueled.

00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:57.200
I'm activating
the spell card...

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.700
Rank‐Up Magic Raid Force!

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:03.166
(Dennis)
You'll use your Fiend Eagle to
Xyz Summon another Raidraptor.

00:07:03.166 --> 00:07:04.433
That's one rank higher.

00:07:04.433 --> 00:07:07.466
Your strategy's as stale
as a loaf of week‐old bread!

00:07:09.866 --> 00:07:11.633
Shay has been busted!

00:07:11.633 --> 00:07:13.500
Dennis has got
his number!

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.500
He isn't just cute,
he's clairvoyant, too!
Ohh.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:19.933
How about pulling something
unexpected for a change?

00:07:19.933 --> 00:07:21.400
You're becoming
way too predictable.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:22.833
Am I?

00:07:22.833 --> 00:07:26.566
You gotta help me keep this
crowd on its toes, buddy‐boy!

00:07:26.566 --> 00:07:28.733
I see through
your strategy, too.

00:07:28.733 --> 00:07:32.433
You like to play subtle
mind games with your opponent.

00:07:32.433 --> 00:07:35.366
Did they teach you that
at the Leo Institute too?

00:07:35.366 --> 00:07:36.900
What are you driving at?

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.833
I'm gonna find out
the truth about you!

00:07:38.833 --> 00:07:40.200
Your move!

00:07:41.666 --> 00:07:44.333
My turn to shine!
Voilà!

00:07:45.966 --> 00:07:48.366
(Dennis)
Oh, dear, I can't
activate this.

00:07:48.366 --> 00:07:49.566
(grunts)

00:07:49.566 --> 00:07:50.666
It would prove to Shay

00:07:50.666 --> 00:07:53.066
that I'm from
the Fusion Dimension.

00:07:53.066 --> 00:07:54.800
Better go with plan B.

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.566
And now I'd like
to perform another trick

00:07:57.566 --> 00:08:00.266
that's sure to impress
my fans and foes alike!

00:08:00.266 --> 00:08:01.833
Dramatic snap!

00:08:03.233 --> 00:08:05.333
Why did Fiend Eagle
lose an Overlay Unit?

00:08:05.333 --> 00:08:06.966
(Dennis)
Maybe this'll
clear things up.

00:08:06.966 --> 00:08:09.033
Hello. Do my eyes
deceive me,

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:12.300
or has Performage Cup
Tricker suddenly appeared?

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:15.266
(rattling)

00:08:15.266 --> 00:08:16.633
What?!

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:19.766
You see, in addition to my
awesome mind‐reading magic,

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.066
I can also summon
Performage Cup Tricker

00:08:22.066 --> 00:08:24.466
by using one Overlay Unit
on the field.

00:08:24.466 --> 00:08:25.466
Not bad, huh?

00:08:25.466 --> 00:08:27.400
You took an Overlay Unit
from me,

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.166
and I'm supposed
to be impressed?

00:08:29.166 --> 00:08:31.600
Nah, this is what
should impress you.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.133
Your Fiend Eagle doesn't
just lose an Overlay Unit,

00:08:34.133 --> 00:08:37.733
it also gives up 600
precious attack points.

00:08:37.733 --> 00:08:38.800
(beeping)

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.900
Oh, great.

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:44.600
After that trick, I have
a very special treat.

00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:48.066
Magical Pendulum Box lets me
draw two cards from my deck.

00:08:48.066 --> 00:08:51.800
If I draw a Pendulum Monster,
it gets added to my hand.

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.366
Otherwise, I send it
straight to the graveyard!

00:08:55.366 --> 00:08:56.866
I hit the jackpot.

00:08:56.866 --> 00:08:58.233
They're both
Pendulum Monsters!

00:09:02.833 --> 00:09:06.400
Performage Bonus Dealer and
Performage Overlay Juggler.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.233
These two fellas are exactly
what I need right now...

00:09:09.233 --> 00:09:10.900
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:14.566
(beeping)

00:09:14.566 --> 00:09:16.466
(Dennis)
Now I can summon monsters

00:09:16.466 --> 00:09:19.466
from Levels four through
five at the same time!

00:09:19.466 --> 00:09:21.600
I Pendulum Summon!

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:25.066
Let the Performage parade
begin!

00:09:25.066 --> 00:09:26.833
(whooshing)

00:09:26.833 --> 00:09:29.533
(Dennis)
First up, we have
Performage Wind Drainer!

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:33.066
Next help me welcome
Performage Wing Sandwichman.

00:09:33.066 --> 00:09:36.866
Lastly, Performage Ball
Balancer spins into sight!

00:09:36.866 --> 00:09:38.000
(Melissa)
<i>Gee‐whillipers!</i>

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:40.366
That was one dilly
of a Pendulum Summon!

00:09:40.366 --> 00:09:42.166
Dennis pulled
off a threefer!

00:09:42.166 --> 00:09:45.433
You're setting up your team
for an Xyz Summon aren't you?

00:09:45.433 --> 00:09:47.066
Oh, you're
the mind reader now.

00:09:47.066 --> 00:09:49.600
Well, I've got another
surprise in the works.

00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:52.333
Use your Pendulum Ability,
Bonus Dealer!

00:09:52.333 --> 00:09:53.766
Thanks to this,

00:09:53.766 --> 00:09:56.566
whenever I Pendulum Summon
at least three Performages,

00:09:56.566 --> 00:09:58.833
I'm entitled
to draw a pair of cards.

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:05.700
(Dennis)
Come join the party,
Performage Fire Dancer!

00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:09.800
I overlay Level four Ball
Balancer and Fire Dancer.

00:10:11.633 --> 00:10:16.033
With these two Monsters,
I build the Overlay Network!

00:10:16.033 --> 00:10:17.266
Better fill up those lungs

00:10:17.266 --> 00:10:19.233
while you have
the chance, folks,

00:10:19.233 --> 00:10:20.833
'cause what you're
about to behold

00:10:20.833 --> 00:10:23.200
will take your breath away!

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.733
I Xyz Summon!

00:10:24.733 --> 00:10:27.900
Put your hands together
for my aerial wonder‐worker,

00:10:27.900 --> 00:10:32.433
Performage Trapeze Magician!

00:10:32.433 --> 00:10:33.766
(Melissa)
<i>Chuck my wagon!</i>

00:10:33.766 --> 00:10:36.300
Both our duelists
can Xyz Summon!

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:38.466
That was so much fun!

00:10:38.466 --> 00:10:40.533
So you know what?
I'll repeat it!

00:10:40.533 --> 00:10:42.933
I Overlay my Cup Tricker...

00:10:42.933 --> 00:10:44.700
Wind Drainer...

00:10:44.700 --> 00:10:48.133
and the great
Wing Sandwichman.

00:10:48.133 --> 00:10:51.800
We have it made in the shade!
I Xyz Summon!

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.366
The monster with the silhouette
you can't forget,

00:10:55.366 --> 00:10:57.966
Performage Shadow Maker.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:11:00.833
With Trapeze Magician's
special ability,

00:11:00.833 --> 00:11:02.900
I can use one
of its Overlay Units

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:05.333
to allow a monster
to attack you, not once,

00:11:05.333 --> 00:11:08.000
but twice in a single turn!

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.566
(laughing)

00:11:09.566 --> 00:11:12.100
And since that monster
is Shadow Maker,

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.733
its special ability
activates as well!

00:11:15.733 --> 00:11:17.733
By using one
of its Overlay Units,

00:11:17.733 --> 00:11:20.733
I can summon another
Shadow Maker from my Extra Deck.

00:11:20.733 --> 00:11:22.566
Mmmm...

00:11:23.933 --> 00:11:26.566
(laughing)

00:11:29.933 --> 00:11:31.100
But that's not all,

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.233
because the Cup Tricker
I sent to my graveyard

00:11:33.233 --> 00:11:35.000
is also getting in
on the action!

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.266
Cup Tricker wants show off
its special ability too!

00:11:39.266 --> 00:11:41.000
Watch it pull a switcheroo

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.333
and move an Overlay Unit from
one Shadow Maker to the other!

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:48.266
Trapeze Magician still has
one Overlay Unit left

00:11:48.266 --> 00:11:49.900
and is gonna use it now!

00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:51.733
It's giving my second
Shadow Maker

00:11:51.733 --> 00:11:54.333
the power to attack twice
as well.

00:11:54.333 --> 00:11:58.600
Why stop at two when
a triumphant trifecta will do?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:00.566
I use Shadow Maker's
Overlay Unit

00:12:00.566 --> 00:12:03.966
to summon
a third Shadow Maker!

00:12:03.966 --> 00:12:05.733
(Melissa)
<i>Blazin' buzzards!</i>

00:12:05.733 --> 00:12:09.533
I never saw one duelist
cast three Shadows before.

00:12:09.533 --> 00:12:12.100
And two of those Shadow
Makers can attack twice!

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:14.366
So if all of them monsters
go full force at once,

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:17.200
then that means they
could do as much damage...

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.300
as a cyclone in
a pottery shop!

00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:23.100
Okay, Trapeze Magician,
take a swing at Fiend Eagle,

00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:25.000
and ground it for good.

00:12:28.966 --> 00:12:32.733
(Dennis)
Okay, Trapeze Magician,
take a swing at Fiend Eagle!

00:12:32.733 --> 00:12:33.966
(whacks)

00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:38.633
It doesn't matter.

00:12:38.633 --> 00:12:40.266
You see, I have a trap card

00:12:40.266 --> 00:12:42.900
that will help me
take control of this duel.

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.233
I activate the trap
Raidraptor Target Flag

00:12:46.233 --> 00:12:49.466
and target
Trapeze Magician!

00:12:49.466 --> 00:12:51.433
Next up, I have
to draw one card,

00:12:51.433 --> 00:12:54.333
and you and I both
get to look at it!

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:55.666
It's a monster card.

00:12:55.666 --> 00:12:57.133
Now pay attention
to what I say

00:12:57.133 --> 00:12:59.633
because I'm only
gonna say it once.

00:12:59.633 --> 00:13:01.033
Huh?

00:13:01.033 --> 00:13:04.000
If your Trapeze Magician
leaves the field,

00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:05.966
Target Flag is destroyed,

00:13:05.966 --> 00:13:09.100
and then I get to check out
the cards in your hand.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.066
Uhh...

00:13:12.633 --> 00:13:14.600
And since I drew
a monster card,

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:17.100
I have the power
to destroy every monster card

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.500
you're holding in your hand!

00:13:18.500 --> 00:13:21.233
(Dennis)
Maybe so, but you're just
spinning your wheels.

00:13:21.233 --> 00:13:22.833
Your life points
are almost gone.

00:13:22.833 --> 00:13:26.033
You can't stop my stars
from shining!
(laughs)

00:13:26.033 --> 00:13:27.966
I'm activating
the spell card

00:13:27.966 --> 00:13:31.000
Rank‐Up Magic
Doom Double Force!

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.400
I'm using it to bring back
my Fiend Eagle

00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:34.833
that was destroyed earlier.

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:37.566
and then I'll Overlay it

00:13:37.566 --> 00:13:41.133
and summon a Raidraptor
with double its Rank!

00:13:41.133 --> 00:13:43.333
I'm gonna keep
pushing you hard, Dennis!

00:13:43.333 --> 00:13:45.566
Sooner or later,
you'll reach the breaking point

00:13:45.566 --> 00:13:47.733
and show your true skills!

00:13:47.733 --> 00:13:51.100
You can't hide the truth
forever.

00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:54.266
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:13:54.266 --> 00:13:58.600
Witness the assent
of Raidraptor Revolution Falcon!

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.566
(explosion)

00:14:01.566 --> 00:14:03.633
Shay just upped the ante
using a monster

00:14:03.633 --> 00:14:05.866
that was past
its expiration date.

00:14:05.866 --> 00:14:08.066
I'll use my Falcon's ability!

00:14:08.066 --> 00:14:09.800
It destroys your monster,

00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:13.033
and you take damage equal
to half its attack points.

00:14:13.033 --> 00:14:14.266
One way or another,

00:14:14.266 --> 00:14:17.366
I'm gonna smoke out the hidden
truth about you, Dennis!

00:14:17.366 --> 00:14:18.833
Let's see how you respond

00:14:18.833 --> 00:14:21.800
when Falcon torches
your Trapeze Magician!

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.300
If you think I'd let you light
up one of my biggest stars,

00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:26.633
you're living in Delusionville!

00:14:26.633 --> 00:14:30.433
I've got its back, and
so does this Performage...

00:14:30.433 --> 00:14:32.866
Magic Tectician!

00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:36.433
Its special ability
makes it a strategic whiz!

00:14:36.433 --> 00:14:38.533
All I have to do
is send Magic Tactician

00:14:38.533 --> 00:14:41.266
and another monster
on my field to the graveyard,

00:14:41.266 --> 00:14:42.800
and that means
your Revolution Falcon

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.266
will attack a different
monster instead!
(cackling)

00:14:45.266 --> 00:14:46.433
Uhh!

00:14:47.833 --> 00:14:49.533
(Dennis)
I lost a Shadow Maker,

00:14:49.533 --> 00:14:54.466
but Trapeze Magician's
special ability kept me
from taking damage.

00:14:54.466 --> 00:14:58.433
Whew! It's not easy
to take either of us down!

00:14:58.433 --> 00:14:59.900
Is it, Trapeze Magician?

00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.500
We both roll
with the punches.

00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:04.833
Oh, I admit you had us
on the defensive

00:15:04.833 --> 00:15:06.566
for a minute or three,

00:15:06.566 --> 00:15:08.300
but if you really
wanna torch us,

00:15:08.300 --> 00:15:11.266
then you'll have to turn up
the heat a whole lot higher!

00:15:11.266 --> 00:15:12.266
Grr!

00:15:12.266 --> 00:15:14.900
This duel's out of control.

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:17.966
I know they had
a friendly rivalry...

00:15:17.966 --> 00:15:20.666
but somehow they've
lost the friendly part.

00:15:27.066 --> 00:15:30.100
I'm gonna rip your mask off
once and for all!

00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:32.066
Whatever!

00:15:32.066 --> 00:15:34.733
Let's treat this crowd
to a slam‐bang finish!

00:15:34.733 --> 00:15:36.066
It's my turn!

00:15:36.066 --> 00:15:39.133
I activate Revolution
Falcon's special ability!

00:15:39.133 --> 00:15:40.766
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:15:40.766 --> 00:15:43.033
it can swoop down and attack
all your monsters!

00:15:43.033 --> 00:15:46.433
Falcon, Take out
Trapeze Magician!

00:15:46.433 --> 00:15:49.133
(Dennis)
Not before I get a piece
of the action, though!

00:15:49.133 --> 00:15:50.533
(pounding)

00:15:50.533 --> 00:15:53.233
(Shay)
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:15:53.233 --> 00:15:57.066
I activate Battle Change!

00:15:57.066 --> 00:16:00.233
This Action Spell redirects
your monster's attack.

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.466
Huh?!

00:16:03.466 --> 00:16:06.500
Instead of trying to take down
my Trapeze Magician,

00:16:06.500 --> 00:16:10.233
your battle bird has to go
after my Shadow Maker instead!

00:16:10.233 --> 00:16:11.933
It's gonna take more
than an Action card

00:16:11.933 --> 00:16:14.333
to get you out
of this mess, Dennis!

00:16:14.333 --> 00:16:17.166
Because of Revolution
Falcon's special ability,

00:16:17.166 --> 00:16:19.100
its attack and defense points
are zeroed out!

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:23.200
(beeping)

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.200
(explosion)

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:27.200
Unh!

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.733
Sorry to disappoint you,

00:16:28.733 --> 00:16:31.466
but I used Overly Juggler's
Pendulum Ability

00:16:31.466 --> 00:16:34.733
to transform Shadow Maker into
an Overlay Unit, which means...

00:16:34.733 --> 00:16:36.700
♪ your attack missed! ♪

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.900
(Shay)
But you really didn't
achieve anything,

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:42.433
because Revolution Falcon can
still attack Trapeze Magician.

00:16:44.833 --> 00:16:46.066
(beeping)

00:16:46.066 --> 00:16:49.833
Revolution Falcon, blast
away at Trapeze Magician!

00:16:49.833 --> 00:16:51.666
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:16:53.533 --> 00:16:55.733
It feels like
I've seen this all before.

00:16:55.733 --> 00:16:58.033
You can pretend this duel
is all fun and games,

00:16:58.033 --> 00:17:00.166
but I know it's really
a battle for survival!

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:01.166
Huh?!

00:17:01.166 --> 00:17:04.333
(explosions)

00:17:04.333 --> 00:17:06.133
Shay's not treating this
like a duel,

00:17:06.133 --> 00:17:08.100
he's battling
like it's an all‐out war!

00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:14.866
(explosion)
(screams)

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.233
Trapeze Magician!

00:17:22.833 --> 00:17:25.900
There's only one high‐flyin'
Monster on the field now,

00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:27.666
and it's not
Trapeze Magician!

00:17:27.666 --> 00:17:30.766
That's gonna cost Dennis
a heap o' life points!

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:33.200
Wait... he didn't lose
one lick of 'em!

00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:35.800
What's the deal
with that?

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.000
What happened!?

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:38.366
Well, you see,
I protected myself

00:17:38.366 --> 00:17:41.100
by playing the Action Spell
Damage Banish.

00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:42.100
(explosion)

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:43.166
I stumbled on it

00:17:43.166 --> 00:17:46.033
just as Trapeze Magician
was destroyed.

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:48.966
Guess you could say
he left me a going‐away present.

00:17:48.966 --> 00:17:51.300
It cuts my battle damage
down to nothing,

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:53.933
so I came out of that attack
as fresh as a daisy!

00:17:53.933 --> 00:17:57.400
Maybe so, but your act
is getting stale.

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:58.533
Drop the faade,

00:17:58.533 --> 00:18:00.866
I'm going to show
everyone the true you!

00:18:00.866 --> 00:18:04.033
Everything I've done
is to set up this moment!

00:18:04.033 --> 00:18:06.500
Remember, when Trapeze
Magician leaves the field,

00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:07.800
Target Flag gets destroyed.

00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.166
(explosion)

00:18:09.166 --> 00:18:11.766
And then I get to see what
you're hiding in your hand!

00:18:16.533 --> 00:18:20.066
It's time for the real
Dennis to now be revealed!

00:18:20.066 --> 00:18:22.266
Is this what
you wanted to see?

00:18:23.533 --> 00:18:25.766
Polymerization.

00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:27.033
I knew it.

00:18:27.033 --> 00:18:29.933
Only duelists from a certain
dimension use that card,

00:18:29.933 --> 00:18:31.733
which means you must be
one of them!

00:18:31.733 --> 00:18:32.666
Your turn!

00:18:34.766 --> 00:18:36.833
Now that the cat's
out of the bag,

00:18:36.833 --> 00:18:39.733
I can hit you
with everything I've got!

00:18:39.733 --> 00:18:43.333
Whether you're ready...
or not!

00:18:46.566 --> 00:18:49.800
First I'll let loose a spell
that'll help get me in gear.

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.800
Chaos Ancient Gear Fusion!

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.933
You have no idea
how good it feels,

00:18:53.933 --> 00:18:55.766
so let the real me shine!

00:18:55.766 --> 00:18:58.333
I'll discard Polymerization
from my hand

00:18:58.333 --> 00:19:01.233
and banish four Xyz Monsters
from my graveyard!

00:19:01.233 --> 00:19:04.033
That move will allow me
to summon four new monsters

00:19:04.033 --> 00:19:06.233
that I'll need to execute
the next step

00:19:06.233 --> 00:19:08.233
in my fiendishly
entertaining scheme!

00:19:08.233 --> 00:19:09.633
(whooshing)

00:19:09.633 --> 00:19:12.033
I have an entire kennel
of Gear Hounds

00:19:12.033 --> 00:19:15.666
ready to do my bidding,
and I'm unleashing them now!

00:19:15.666 --> 00:19:18.000
Ancient Gear Hunting Hound...
(growling...)

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.500
Double Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound...

00:19:20.500 --> 00:19:23.300
(laughing)
Triple Ancient
Gear Hunting Hound...

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.833
and Ultimate Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound!

00:19:26.833 --> 00:19:29.966
Those monsters were used by...

00:19:29.966 --> 00:19:32.200
Obelisk Force.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:34.366
And if you think that's
an impressive sight,

00:19:34.366 --> 00:19:36.300
then just wait till
you see what happens

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.066
after I take all four of
my Ancient Gear Hunting Hounds

00:19:39.066 --> 00:19:40.666
and fuse them together.

00:19:40.666 --> 00:19:42.466
Once joined,
they'll form an Ancient Gear

00:19:42.466 --> 00:19:44.466
of goliath proportions!

00:19:44.466 --> 00:19:46.366
(whooshing)

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:49.733
I Fusion Summon

00:19:49.733 --> 00:19:54.166
The ground‐shaking
Chaos Ancient Gear Giant!

00:19:55.566 --> 00:19:57.533
(loud cranking)

00:20:02.666 --> 00:20:05.800
(beeping)

00:20:11.566 --> 00:20:14.033
(gasping)

00:20:14.033 --> 00:20:15.800
(Melissa)
<i>Weepin' whillipers!</i>

00:20:15.800 --> 00:20:18.133
I've seen some big critters
in my day,

00:20:18.133 --> 00:20:20.833
but that one
takes the ranch!

00:20:20.833 --> 00:20:23.733
Where did Dennis dig up
a Monster that size?

00:20:23.733 --> 00:20:24.966
That war machine!

00:20:24.966 --> 00:20:26.233
(girl)
Run!

00:20:26.233 --> 00:20:27.200
(man)
They're relentless!

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.933
Help!
Move it!

00:20:28.933 --> 00:20:30.366
Quick, this way!

00:20:30.366 --> 00:20:31.433
(screaming)

00:20:31.433 --> 00:20:32.733
(panting)

00:20:34.666 --> 00:20:36.666
(loud stomping)

00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.333
I can tell by the look in your
eye you two have met before.

00:20:41.333 --> 00:20:43.666
I knew you were from
the Fusion Dimension!

00:20:43.666 --> 00:20:44.533
Whoa!
Oh!
Uhh!

00:20:46.133 --> 00:20:49.500
You have someone from the Fusion
Dimension on your team?

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:51.433
I thought you were
fighting against them?

00:20:51.433 --> 00:20:53.200
What is the meaning of this?

00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:54.566
I can't explain.

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:56.900
This is
quite a revelation.

00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.733
If you cannot trust
in the members of your own team,

00:20:59.733 --> 00:21:02.866
then why should the council
have any confidence in you?

00:21:02.866 --> 00:21:04.966
It's true we were deceived,

00:21:04.966 --> 00:21:08.233
but at least the enemy agent
has finally been revealed.

00:21:08.233 --> 00:21:12.166
Of course, there could be a
traitor on your side as well.

00:21:12.166 --> 00:21:14.366
(Melissa)
This duel could still
go either way,

00:21:14.366 --> 00:21:17.033
but it looks like Dennis
has the inside track.

00:21:17.033 --> 00:21:19.833
In fact, with that
mega‐monster on his team,

00:21:19.833 --> 00:21:22.300
he controls the
whole track!

00:21:22.300 --> 00:21:24.500
Bet you never saw
that coming right?!
