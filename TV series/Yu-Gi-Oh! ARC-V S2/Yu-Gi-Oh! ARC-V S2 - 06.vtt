Previously
on "Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"&amp;

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.033
Welcome to the Synchro
Dimension!

00:00:06.033 --> 00:00:07.600
What?

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.833
I remember how I freaked
out the first time I got sent

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.500
to another
dimension.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.900
That's the day I lost Rin Rin.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:15.833
Careful!

00:00:15.833 --> 00:00:17.266
Watch yourself!

00:00:17.266 --> 00:00:19.066
Don't touch that!

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.033
Oh, no!

00:00:20.033 --> 00:00:21.500
(mother)
It's full of germs!

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.666
What's the deal,
Yugo?

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.900
(mother)
Someone help!

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:25.966
Yugo?

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.800
Let's go!

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:29.900
Call Sector Security!

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.833
We were in a restricted,
Tops‐only area

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:34.566
that's
off‐limits to us.

00:00:34.566 --> 00:00:36.666
Topsiders are
the haves of society

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.733
who possess all the
wealth and power here

00:00:38.733 --> 00:00:40.500
in New Domino City.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.366
It's like a fantasyland,
up here.

00:00:43.366 --> 00:00:45.300
But down there
where I live...

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.233
Ah!

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.500
It's a different
world.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.766
Topsiders call the people
who live here "Commons."

00:00:53.766 --> 00:00:57.866
There's only one way to get out
of the slums, and it's to win.

00:00:57.866 --> 00:00:59.800
(man on loudspeaker)
<i>This is Sector Security.</i>

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.533
<i>Pull over immediately!</i>

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:05.700
I activate the Field Spell
Speed World Neo!

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.933
(computer voice)
Duel Mode engaged.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:11.600
<i>Auto‐pilot activated.</i>

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.500
What's going on?

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.566
He's forcing us to duel
and if we lose,

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:17.066
he'll arrest
the both of us.

00:01:17.066 --> 00:01:20.000
Hold on tight 'cause
we're going supersonic!

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:22.833

(woman)
Speed World Neo has been
successfully deployed.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.700
Sector Security
is in pursuit.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.666
Officer 227 of the specialized
Duel Chaser Unit

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:37.333
is closing in
on the renegade Turbo Duelist.

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:38.766
Where are they dueling?

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:40.300
(woman)
<i>Running along Route 8.</i>

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:44.900
Heading from the Villa area
towards City Center.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.866
Very good.

00:02:46.866 --> 00:02:49.833
It's your move...
or so you think.

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:57.000
(siren wailing)

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.366
Hang on tight.

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:03.500
It's time
to throttle this guy!

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.633
First, I'll set the pace
with Speedroid Tri‐Eyed Dice!

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:12.966
And it lets me also summon
this little fly guy,

00:03:12.966 --> 00:03:16.700
so take to the air,
Speedroid Taketomborg!

00:03:22.933 --> 00:03:27.300
I tune Level 3 Tri‐Eyed Dice
with Level 3 Taketomborg!

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:38.433
I Synchro Summon...

00:03:38.433 --> 00:03:41.266
Hi‐Speedroid Kendama!

00:03:46.133 --> 00:03:48.333
Pretty impressive!

00:03:48.333 --> 00:03:49.800
That
was nothing!

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.333
I activate Hi‐Speedroid
Kendama's special ability!

00:03:53.333 --> 00:03:55.600
By banishing one Speedroid
from my graveyard,

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:58.500
he takes 500 points
of damage!

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.100
Yes!

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.466
Advantage me!

00:04:07.466 --> 00:04:10.633
And this facedown is gonna make
sure it stays that way!

00:04:10.633 --> 00:04:13.333
Your move, if you can keep up,
that is!

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:21.333
(anxious moan)

00:04:21.333 --> 00:04:23.000
Are you seriously
dueling that guy

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.100
and driving this thing
at the same time?

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.766
Of course.

00:04:26.766 --> 00:04:29.300
(screaming)

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.400
Has anyone ever told you
that this...

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.266
is nuts!

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:40.233
One more zig or zag,
and I promise I'm gonna gag!

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:42.200
(helicopter approaching)
What now?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.266
Aw, not them!

00:04:58.852 --> 00:05:02.619
We're interrupting our regularly
scheduled broadcast to rustle up

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:05.619
this live report
from high above Route 8!

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:07.786
I'm Melissa Trail here
with exclusive coverage

00:05:07.786 --> 00:05:11.286
of a high speed chase
from our Tops TV Sky Eye!

00:05:11.286 --> 00:05:13.752
(woman on intercom)
Director, there's a
news copter on the scene!

00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:15.819
How would you
like us to proceed?

00:05:15.819 --> 00:05:17.119
Do nothing.

00:05:17.119 --> 00:05:19.119
This type of thing
is inevitable.

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:22.286
Topsiders like to view Sector
Security chasing duelists

00:05:22.286 --> 00:05:23.886
for their own
entertainment.

00:05:23.886 --> 00:05:26.486
Privilege can sometimes
be monotonous,

00:05:26.486 --> 00:05:28.886
so let's
give them a real thrill.

00:05:28.886 --> 00:05:31.852
Change the path
from Route 8 to 11.

00:05:31.852 --> 00:05:33.019
<i>Yes, sir.</i>

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:48.152
Looks like
we got a detour.

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:52.352
Boy, oh, boy!

00:05:52.352 --> 00:05:53.919
We got ourselves
a real dust‐up

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:57.086
with one of Sector Securities
good ol' boys hot on the
heels

00:05:57.086 --> 00:05:59.119
<i>of two feisty Commons!</i>

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:02.186
If you're just joining us,
lemme get y'all up to speed:

00:06:02.186 --> 00:06:05.286
the Commons struck first and
rustled up 500 points of
pain.

00:06:05.286 --> 00:06:07.519
Now Security's forced
to play catch up!

00:06:07.519 --> 00:06:09.752
That copper sure has his work
cut out for him

00:06:09.752 --> 00:06:11.819
if he wants to
wrassle those Commons!

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:14.619
And I'll be here to bring
y'all the action as it
happens!

00:06:17.752 --> 00:06:19.552
After I run circles
around you,

00:06:19.552 --> 00:06:23.252
they're gonna put you
on parking patrol.

00:06:23.252 --> 00:06:24.352
Silence, Commoner.

00:06:24.352 --> 00:06:25.952
Your defeat and capture
is a given.

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:28.486
My apprehension
rate is 100%.

00:06:28.486 --> 00:06:31.052
The chance of me losing
to a sewer rat like you?

00:06:31.052 --> 00:06:31.986
Zero.

00:06:33.619 --> 00:06:35.552
Now I'll show you why!

00:06:35.552 --> 00:06:38.486
I summon
Jutte Fighter!

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:42.719
Next I'll power down

00:06:42.719 --> 00:06:45.652
500 of your Hi‐Speedroid
Kendama's attack points

00:06:45.652 --> 00:06:49.552
to summon Sasumata Gardna
in defense mode.

00:06:52.852 --> 00:06:57.652
I tune Level 2 Jutte Fighter
with Level 3 Sasumata Gardna!

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:01.852
This is your worst
nightmare:

00:07:01.852 --> 00:07:04.952
A monster
that always gets his man.

00:07:04.952 --> 00:07:06.386
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:06.386 --> 00:07:08.152
Goyo Chaser&amp;

00:07:08.152 --> 00:07:10.252
Front and center!

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:16.352
Goyo Chaser, take down
Hi‐Speedroid Kendama!

00:07:25.386 --> 00:07:28.019
The outlaws just got served
some justice!

00:07:28.019 --> 00:07:29.452
Just as planned.

00:07:29.452 --> 00:07:32.052
Keep the pressure
on them.

00:07:32.052 --> 00:07:34.552
Thanks to Goyo Chaser's
special ability

00:07:34.552 --> 00:07:37.486
I can summon
Hi‐Speedroid Kendama to my field

00:07:37.486 --> 00:07:40.152
by cutting its attack points
in half.

00:07:42.252 --> 00:07:44.552
Aah!

00:07:44.552 --> 00:07:49.319
(Director)
Attacking now with Hi‐Speedroid
Kendama is the optimal move.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:52.786
Isn't your job to stop stealing,
not practice it?

00:07:58.619 --> 00:08:02.319
(Melissa) The outlaws
take a major hit!

00:08:02.319 --> 00:08:03.419
Are you okay?

00:08:03.419 --> 00:08:05.386
No, I'm Yugo,
remember?

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:06.486
Just kidding.

00:08:06.486 --> 00:08:10.919
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:08:10.919 --> 00:08:14.452
He doesn't even know
he can't get away anymore.

00:08:14.452 --> 00:08:17.552
Reroute all Security
to District D.

00:08:17.552 --> 00:08:20.419
That's a perfect
placefor this to end.

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:21.719
(woman)
Yes, sir.

00:08:21.719 --> 00:08:24.319
But we need make sure
theCommons watching the duel

00:08:24.319 --> 00:08:27.152
don't do
anything...unpleasant.

00:08:27.152 --> 00:08:31.186
Raise the City alert
levelto 5, just in case.

00:08:31.186 --> 00:08:33.186
(Melissa)
Security's really pouring it on!

00:08:33.186 --> 00:08:35.319
Unless these outlaws
are packing raincoats,

00:08:35.319 --> 00:08:36.686
they're gonna be more
washed up

00:08:36.686 --> 00:08:38.086
than yesterday's laundry!

00:08:38.086 --> 00:08:41.719
Let's kick it up a gear,
and lay some tracks!

00:08:43.152 --> 00:08:46.719
Look out, 'cause Speedroid
Ohajikid's coming at you!

00:08:50.052 --> 00:08:54.152
You think you were so clever
before, taking my monster,

00:08:54.152 --> 00:08:57.119
and then using it
against me?

00:08:57.119 --> 00:08:58.286
Well, you know what?

00:08:58.286 --> 00:08:59.852
Two can play at that game.

00:08:59.852 --> 00:09:01.552
Thanks to my Ohajikid,

00:09:01.552 --> 00:09:05.552
I get to take your Tuner Monster
and use it to Synchro Summon!

00:09:08.019 --> 00:09:12.586
I tune Level 2 Jutte Fighter
with Level 3 Speedroid Ohajikid!

00:09:13.786 --> 00:09:15.886
I Synchro Summon!

00:09:15.886 --> 00:09:17.219
Say hello
to a monster

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:19.686
that always edges out
the competition...

00:09:19.686 --> 00:09:22.152
Hi‐Speedroid Chanbara!

00:09:27.219 --> 00:09:28.619
I'll be!

00:09:28.619 --> 00:09:31.519
The outlaw just served up a
little payback, giving Security

00:09:31.519 --> 00:09:33.052
a taste of his medicine!

00:09:33.052 --> 00:09:34.086
Chanbara!

00:09:34.086 --> 00:09:37.852
Cut Hi‐Speedroid Kendama down
to size!

00:09:37.852 --> 00:09:41.386
And thanks to its special
ability, when Chanbara battles,

00:09:41.386 --> 00:09:43.619
it gets an extra hundred attack
points!

00:09:49.752 --> 00:09:51.119
And there's more!

00:09:51.119 --> 00:09:52.952
Chanbara can
attack twice!

00:09:56.386 --> 00:09:57.486
No way!

00:09:57.486 --> 00:09:58.752
Remember,

00:09:58.752 --> 00:10:01.652
battling makes Hi‐Speedroid
Chanbara even stronger.

00:10:01.652 --> 00:10:04.319
A hundred points stronger!

00:10:10.886 --> 00:10:12.752
Stings,
doesn't it?

00:10:12.752 --> 00:10:14.486
From up here,
it looks to me

00:10:14.486 --> 00:10:18.586
like this outlaw keeps
handcuffing any move
Sector Security makes!

00:10:18.586 --> 00:10:21.619
This is highly uncommon
for a Common.

00:10:21.619 --> 00:10:23.819
Unbeknownst to them,
this is all playing out

00:10:23.819 --> 00:10:26.086
just as I have
planned.

00:10:26.086 --> 00:10:27.819
Before they know it,

00:10:27.819 --> 00:10:29.352
it will be
game over.

00:10:30.552 --> 00:10:33.319
Now I'm activating
Descending Lost Star.

00:10:33.319 --> 00:10:36.319
This trap lets me pick one
Synchro Monster in my graveyard

00:10:36.319 --> 00:10:38.919
and summon it
in defense mode!

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:40.786
I select Goyo Chaser!

00:10:47.652 --> 00:10:51.119
Goyo Chaser loses a Level
and all its defense points,

00:10:51.119 --> 00:10:53.986
but it's still going
to protect and serve.

00:10:53.986 --> 00:10:56.452
That monster sure looks like
a shell of its former self,

00:10:56.452 --> 00:10:58.519
but at least Security's
got some needed backup.

00:10:58.519 --> 00:11:01.019
I'm going
to end my turn.

00:11:01.019 --> 00:11:02.586
(Melissa)
<i>What a showdown!</i>

00:11:02.586 --> 00:11:04.686
Security hasn't slowed
for a second

00:11:04.686 --> 00:11:07.019
but y'all have to give
this outlaw his due.

00:11:07.019 --> 00:11:09.019
<i>He's a dynamic duelist!</i>

00:11:09.019 --> 00:11:11.619
(scoffing)
Give him his due.

00:11:11.619 --> 00:11:14.952
She doesn't have the slightest
idea what she's saying.

00:11:14.952 --> 00:11:19.319
This outlaw is about to play
his last move‐‐ ever!

00:11:34.795 --> 00:11:36.395
This is Melissa Trail
here,

00:11:36.395 --> 00:11:38.995
reporting live
from the Tops TV Sky Eye.

00:11:38.995 --> 00:11:40.462
The battle between
Sector Security

00:11:40.462 --> 00:11:42.228
and one of the Commons'
boldest outlaws

00:11:42.228 --> 00:11:44.828
is kicking into
high gear!

00:11:44.828 --> 00:11:45.995
Hey, hot rod!

00:11:45.995 --> 00:11:48.862
You should give yourself
a speeding ticket!

00:11:48.862 --> 00:11:51.062
Zip it, punk!

00:11:51.062 --> 00:11:53.295
The only one getting
a ticket today is you,

00:11:53.295 --> 00:11:56.562
and it's a one‐way ticket,
straight to The Facility!

00:11:56.562 --> 00:11:58.295
Is that so?

00:11:58.295 --> 00:12:00.295
Gotta catch me
first!

00:12:00.295 --> 00:12:03.162
(Zuzu screaming)

00:12:03.162 --> 00:12:04.728
(Yugo)
How's my dust taste?

00:12:04.728 --> 00:12:05.728
Dirty rat.

00:12:08.962 --> 00:12:10.862
I'll be a monkey's aunt!

00:12:10.862 --> 00:12:14.928
I've seen a lot of wild moves
but never one quite like that!

00:12:14.928 --> 00:12:16.628
Yugo,
be careful!

00:12:16.628 --> 00:12:20.728
I can't let them catch us and
throw us into The Facility.

00:12:20.728 --> 00:12:23.362
It's horrible, like
something out of a nightmare,

00:12:23.362 --> 00:12:26.762
but, at least you can wake up
from nightmares.

00:12:26.762 --> 00:12:29.662
Once you're in The Facility,
there's no getting out.

00:12:30.395 --> 00:12:31.862
And if I can't get out,

00:12:31.862 --> 00:12:33.795
then there's no
Friendship Cup for me...

00:12:33.795 --> 00:12:35.728
and if I'm going to change
things around here,

00:12:35.728 --> 00:12:38.128
it starts there!

00:12:38.128 --> 00:12:39.828
The only way you're
ever gonna take me in

00:12:39.828 --> 00:12:41.728
is if you're able
to take me out first!

00:12:41.728 --> 00:12:43.128
That works for me.

00:12:43.128 --> 00:12:44.262
Now say goodbye.

00:12:44.262 --> 00:12:47.095
Torapart's throwing you
a farewell party!

00:12:50.495 --> 00:12:52.828
I tune Torapart
with Goyo Chaser!

00:12:57.062 --> 00:12:59.862
To catch my prey,
I call a predator.

00:12:59.862 --> 00:13:01.695
I Synchro Summon!

00:13:01.695 --> 00:13:04.428
Level 6
Goyo Predator!

00:13:05.562 --> 00:13:06.928
Goyo Predator!

00:13:06.928 --> 00:13:10.862
You know your assignment:
attack Chanbara full force!

00:13:12.995 --> 00:13:14.695
When Chanbara
battles,

00:13:14.695 --> 00:13:17.995
its attack points get
a hundred point power‐up.

00:13:23.628 --> 00:13:25.962
We've reached our end game.

00:13:25.962 --> 00:13:30.562
Once Officer 227's Goyo Predator
destroys this Commons monster,

00:13:30.562 --> 00:13:32.362
he gets to summon it.

00:13:34.262 --> 00:13:35.828
(Melissa)
I'm not hearing the music,

00:13:35.828 --> 00:13:38.662
but that monster looks to be
doing the do‐si‐do!

00:13:38.662 --> 00:13:41.428
This Turbo Duel's
in the final stretch!

00:13:41.428 --> 00:13:43.528
Y'know, you've been
stealing my monsters from me

00:13:43.528 --> 00:13:45.462
since we started
this duel!

00:13:45.462 --> 00:13:49.362
I never expected Security
would have to sink that low.

00:13:49.362 --> 00:13:52.262
I don't need to hear this
from a stinking criminal.

00:13:52.262 --> 00:13:55.328
I'll do whatever it takes
to put you where you belong.

00:13:58.428 --> 00:14:01.362
The queen puts the king
in check.

00:14:01.362 --> 00:14:05.295
Chanbara, attack with
100 more attack points!

00:14:13.362 --> 00:14:16.562
Chanbara can attack
us again, Yugo!

00:14:16.562 --> 00:14:18.262
We're done for!

00:14:19.395 --> 00:14:21.895
One last shot
and it's over.

00:14:26.095 --> 00:14:27.062
Checkmate.

00:14:31.628 --> 00:14:35.228
Wait, he played a facedown card
on his first turn&amp;

00:14:35.228 --> 00:14:37.462
and he never used it!

00:14:37.462 --> 00:14:39.628
Officer 227,
do not attack!

00:14:39.628 --> 00:14:41.928
I repeat,
do not attack!

00:14:41.928 --> 00:14:44.795
I'll break my record for
consecutive collars‐‐

00:14:44.795 --> 00:14:46.128
Ha ha!

00:14:46.128 --> 00:14:47.695
and get a
big promotion!

00:14:47.695 --> 00:14:50.795
There's no escaping the long arm
of the law!

00:14:50.795 --> 00:14:53.495
Chanbara, attack
one more time!

00:14:56.795 --> 00:14:59.728
I activate the trap
Dice Roll Battle!

00:14:59.728 --> 00:15:02.295
Since I have fewer
than 1000 Life Points,

00:15:02.295 --> 00:15:05.328
by sending one DICE monster
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:15:05.328 --> 00:15:09.028
I can Synchro Summon
using monsters in my graveyard!

00:15:09.028 --> 00:15:10.295
No way!

00:15:10.295 --> 00:15:13.895
I send Speedroid Red‐Eyed Dice
to the graveyard!

00:15:13.895 --> 00:15:15.895
I tune
Level 1 Red‐Eyed Dice

00:15:15.895 --> 00:15:18.928
with Level 6 Hi‐Speedroid
Kendama!

00:15:24.128 --> 00:15:27.762
Beat your wings to whip up a
whirlwind of destruction!

00:15:29.362 --> 00:15:31.162
I Synchro Summon!

00:15:31.162 --> 00:15:34.562
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:15:38.628 --> 00:15:40.228
It gets worse for you.

00:15:40.228 --> 00:15:41.995
Thanks to Dice Roll Battle's
effect,

00:15:41.995 --> 00:15:45.328
all the monsters on your field
have to battle Clear Wing!

00:15:45.328 --> 00:15:48.095
And it doesn't matter how strong
your Chanbara is

00:15:48.095 --> 00:15:49.762
because
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon

00:15:49.762 --> 00:15:52.595
negates its special abilities
and destroys it!

00:16:00.228 --> 00:16:01.728
This can't be!

00:16:01.728 --> 00:16:04.528
(Yugo)
Reverse Revenge!

00:16:09.062 --> 00:16:10.695
And now,

00:16:10.695 --> 00:16:14.328
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon gains
the destroyed monster's attack
points!

00:16:18.762 --> 00:16:21.762
That's totally gotta be
against the law!

00:16:21.762 --> 00:16:25.062
Sorry, but this is one
law‐abiding Dragon!

00:16:25.062 --> 00:16:27.695
And it's about to take you out
fair and square!

00:16:28.495 --> 00:16:30.062
No!
What can I do?!

00:16:35.362 --> 00:16:38.862
Now Clear Wing,
attack!

00:16:48.128 --> 00:16:51.228
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:17:00.828 --> 00:17:02.728
It's over.

00:17:06.262 --> 00:17:07.662
You did it!

00:17:10.462 --> 00:17:12.128
(Melissa)
<i>This is incredible!</i>

00:17:12.128 --> 00:17:14.928
Sector Security just got
served!

00:17:15.762 --> 00:17:17.395
This is most unfortunate.

00:17:17.395 --> 00:17:22.062
Detour those Commons to Point 5
in District D immediately.

00:17:22.062 --> 00:17:23.528
Seal off the ramps.

00:17:23.528 --> 00:17:26.328
Put all Security in the area
on alert.

00:17:26.328 --> 00:17:28.128
(woman)
<i>Yes, sir!</i>

00:17:28.128 --> 00:17:32.462
As for Officer 227,
what a disappointment.

00:17:32.462 --> 00:17:34.462
Have him turn in
his Runner.

00:17:34.462 --> 00:17:37.095
He's useless as trash.

00:17:39.195 --> 00:17:41.128
We're in the clear,
right?

00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:42.828
I'd say no.

00:17:42.828 --> 00:17:44.228
Aah!

00:17:45.928 --> 00:17:47.328
Slam on the brakes!

00:17:47.328 --> 00:17:49.195
And ruin the fun?

00:17:49.195 --> 00:17:50.495
Not a chance!

00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:11.763
(sirens wailing)

00:18:11.763 --> 00:18:13.063
Aaah!

00:18:13.063 --> 00:18:15.430
I hope you're up
for this.

00:18:15.430 --> 00:18:16.930
(Zuzu)
Yugo, stop!

00:18:16.930 --> 00:18:17.863
Stand by!

00:18:20.997 --> 00:18:24.297
It's time to take to the sky!

00:18:29.863 --> 00:18:31.297
Let's move!

00:18:31.297 --> 00:18:34.463
I'm havin' a hard time believing
what my eyes are seein', folks!

00:18:34.463 --> 00:18:36.197
Not only did those outlaws win
the duel,

00:18:36.197 --> 00:18:37.797
but they
just outfoxed Security,

00:18:37.797 --> 00:18:41.097
by jumping over 'em
like a jackrabbit!

00:18:41.097 --> 00:18:43.563
If they get caught, they'll
never see the light of day.

00:18:45.130 --> 00:18:46.430
This is Melissa Trail!

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:48.063
Thanks for
watching and goodnight!

00:18:49.263 --> 00:18:51.030
Get Security to‐‐
Lock down the route‐‐

00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.197
from District D to
District R immediately!

00:18:53.197 --> 00:18:54.430
Seal off
all access roads!

00:18:54.430 --> 00:18:56.197
Copy!
We're on the way!

00:18:56.197 --> 00:18:57.463
Put the entire city
in total lockdown!

00:18:57.463 --> 00:18:58.797
Central Com just
uploaded photos

00:18:58.797 --> 00:19:01.497
of the outlaw and
his female companion.

00:19:04.197 --> 00:19:06.930
You two may think you've
escaped&amp;

00:19:06.930 --> 00:19:08.930
But my eyes are everywhere.

00:19:20.197 --> 00:19:22.230
Well, that certainly wasn't
first class service

00:19:22.230 --> 00:19:23.997
by any means.

00:19:23.997 --> 00:19:24.997
Where are we?

00:19:24.997 --> 00:19:26.530
Like Declan said...

00:19:26.530 --> 00:19:28.497
The
Synchro Dimension.

00:19:28.497 --> 00:19:31.397
Then let's get moving
and find Zuzu!

00:19:33.963 --> 00:19:37.130
Looks like there's a whole other
world above this one.

00:19:37.130 --> 00:19:40.330
I wonder if Gong and the others
are up there?

00:19:41.197 --> 00:19:43.663
(sirens approach, tires screech)

00:19:43.663 --> 00:19:45.663
Your little game is over.

00:19:45.663 --> 00:19:48.030
You should've known
you couldn't elude us forever.

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.497
I hope this isn't
the welcome committee.

00:19:50.497 --> 00:19:51.997
Yeah, it's them
all right.

00:19:51.997 --> 00:19:55.197
They're dressed different,
but the faces match the photos.

00:19:55.197 --> 00:19:56.397
There's two others
with 'em.

00:19:56.397 --> 00:19:57.230
(Director)
<i>Excellent.</i>

00:19:57.230 --> 00:19:59.030
Bring them in
right away.

00:20:02.163 --> 00:20:06.263
Riley, come back!

00:20:06.263 --> 00:20:07.963
Aah! Uhn!

00:20:08.830 --> 00:20:10.730
Riley,
are you okay?

00:20:10.730 --> 00:20:12.497
You hit that wall
pretty hard.

00:20:12.497 --> 00:20:14.497
It wasn't there
a second ago.

00:20:14.497 --> 00:20:15.897
It appeared
outta nowhere.

00:20:21.663 --> 00:20:24.063
We've been looking
all over for you lousy punks

00:20:24.063 --> 00:20:25.263
since last night!

00:20:25.263 --> 00:20:27.130
Don't give us any trouble!

00:20:27.130 --> 00:20:28.197
Last night?

00:20:28.197 --> 00:20:29.463
But we just got here.

00:20:29.463 --> 00:20:31.597
There must be some sorta
mistake.

00:20:31.597 --> 00:20:33.863
(officer)
Can it and put
your hands up!

00:20:33.863 --> 00:20:35.063
Do you know who I am?

00:20:35.063 --> 00:20:37.897
My dad's going to be mayor
and fire you all!

00:20:37.897 --> 00:20:39.897
So go on
and arrest me!

00:20:39.897 --> 00:20:41.430
Come on,
I dare you!

00:20:41.430 --> 00:20:42.530
Sylvio, chill&amp;

00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:43.897
You're making a bad first
impression.

00:20:43.897 --> 00:20:46.463
I'm not gonna stand
for this kind of abuse!

00:20:46.463 --> 00:20:49.663
Let's see if your bark is
as bad as your breath!

00:20:53.930 --> 00:20:56.330
Sylvio, this isn't
a good idea.

00:20:57.297 --> 00:20:59.563
No, Celina,
not you, too?

00:20:59.563 --> 00:21:02.630
I activate the
Action Field...

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:03.963
(computer voice)
<i>Crossover.</i>

00:21:11.997 --> 00:21:14.297
Action Cards
dispersed.

00:21:14.297 --> 00:21:15.563
Let's duel!

00:21:21.230 --> 00:21:25.330
So much for first impressions.

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:33.563
