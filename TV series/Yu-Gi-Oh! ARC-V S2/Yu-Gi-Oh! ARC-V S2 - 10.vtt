(Gong)
What is this place?!

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:09.066
This is New Domino City's

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.000
numero uno
underground duel arena,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.733
where the Commons can let loose
and enjoy a little competition

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.666
away from the pryin' eyes
of the Tops' cops.

No way we'll find
our friends here!

Oh!

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.533
That's... Shay!

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:24.566
I'm here for
the same reason you're here...

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.500
to find powerful duelists.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.600
Shay, we both know we need
Yuya to take down Fusion,

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.900
so let's stop
this Turbo Duelin' nonsense

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.200
and go find him!

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.666
There's more to this duel
than you realize, Gong.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:37.700
It's a feeder to get
into the Friendship Cup.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.366
What's this Friendship Cup?

00:00:39.366 --> 00:00:42.433
(Lucas Swank)
It's New Domino City's
biggest duel tournament.

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:44.966
Winner gets to battle
Mr. Jack Atlas...

00:00:44.966 --> 00:00:47.833
the Master of Faster himself.

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:50.866

gettin' one peek at me

of admission alone!

00:02:43.333 --> 00:02:45.166
But peel your peepers
away from my threads

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:48.100
and you'll see this duel
is still anyone's match!

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.966
Question is‐‐
who wants it more?!

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:53.066
Or better yet...

00:02:53.066 --> 00:02:56.066
Who wants more looks at me

But, fine,
your emcee can take a hint.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.466
What do you say we see
what these two duelists

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.066
have in store for us next?!

00:03:11.066 --> 00:03:13.033

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:16.933
All right, then!

00:03:16.933 --> 00:03:19.200
I think it's time
to take this duel...

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.533
to the next level‐‐
and I mean literally!

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:25.900
I activate Wing Sandwichman's
special abilities!

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.266
They squish the tasty juices
out of the monster between them,

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:32.066
raising its Level to Level 5!

00:03:36.066 --> 00:03:39.300
Now that my three monsters
all have the same Level,

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.633
I can overlay them!

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:47.200
And that allows me...

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.500
to Xyz Summon!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.533
Now taking the stage is Rank 5
Performage Shadow Maker!

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:55.766
Check that out!

00:03:55.766 --> 00:03:57.966
Those shears looks so sweet...

00:03:57.966 --> 00:04:00.733
I might even let 'em
cut my manly mane!

00:04:00.733 --> 00:04:03.233
(cheering)

00:04:03.233 --> 00:04:04.366
(laughs)

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:06.633
This crowd is behind me
all the way!

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.933
So much for Shay, am I right?

00:04:08.933 --> 00:04:12.566
If Dennis attacks with his
new monster, Shay is done for!

00:04:12.566 --> 00:04:14.100
Ohh! Not Shay...

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.400
He's so cute...

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.233
But then Dennis
is pretty sweet, too!

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:20.100
Dueling doesn't get
better than this!

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:22.566
This next move's gonna
decide everything.

00:04:22.566 --> 00:04:23.533
So you know
what that means?

00:04:23.533 --> 00:04:25.666
No bathroom break
for me.

00:04:25.666 --> 00:04:29.500
You can cut the tension in
this duel arena with a
knife!

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.133
Or better yet,
with a pair of scissors!

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:35.033
Is Dennis gonna cut Shay's
life points down to
confetti?

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:36.366
Or does Shay have
one more way

00:04:36.366 --> 00:04:39.300
to sashay his way
out of danger?

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.900
Well, Shay...
Been nice duelin' ya...

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:44.166
But it's time to leave you
in the dust!

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:49.600
Don't be so sure.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.933
Oh, please‐‐ don't even try!

00:04:55.933 --> 00:04:57.000
(worried grumble)

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.433
Here goes...

00:04:58.433 --> 00:05:00.833
This battle decides everything!

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:02.333
Whee!

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:04.800
Shadow Maker, end this now!

00:05:12.633 --> 00:05:14.300
You think
you cut up my life points,

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.033
but you couldn't be more wrong.

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:18.100
'Cause even though
you destroyed my monster,

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.833
Raptor's Ultimate Mace stops me
from taking any damage.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:23.333
And there's more...

00:05:23.333 --> 00:05:26.233
I can then add one
Rank‐Up‐Magic to my hand!

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:28.066
And the one I pick...

00:05:28.066 --> 00:05:31.700
Is none other than Rank‐Up‐Magic
Revolution Force!

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:36.533
Nice move there, Shay...

00:05:36.533 --> 00:05:39.200
But it's not going to make
a bit of difference.

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:41.466
You can only use that spell card
during your turn

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:45.433
and I'm gonna make sure
that turn never happens!

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:49.266
I don't think so‐‐ I activate
the trap Lightning Quick!

00:05:49.266 --> 00:05:53.700
It lets me activate
the spell card I just got.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:54.766
Huh?!

00:05:54.766 --> 00:05:57.600
Rank‐Up‐Magic Revolution Force!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:00.100
I get to take control
of your Shadow Maker.

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.666
(startled gasp)

00:06:05.666 --> 00:06:07.500
Then I can use
Shadow Maker

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:11.233
to Xyz Summon a monster
that's one Rank higher!

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:18.066
Fiercest falcon,
set your wings ablaze

00:06:18.066 --> 00:06:21.000
and lock your gaze
on our ill‐fated foe!

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.233
Now, make it so!

00:06:23.233 --> 00:06:26.233
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:06:26.233 --> 00:06:30.633
Emerge,
Raidraptor ‐ Revolution Falcon!

00:06:33.866 --> 00:06:34.933
What a switch!

00:06:34.933 --> 00:06:36.733
Now Shay's
got a mega‐monster...

00:06:36.733 --> 00:06:39.166
and Dennis has got zip.

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.733
Far out! Far out!

00:06:41.733 --> 00:06:43.266
That was great!

00:06:43.266 --> 00:06:44.733
But not nearly as great

00:06:44.733 --> 00:06:47.566
as my righteous ring collection,
am I right? Yeah!

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:51.833
(gasps)

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:57.100
What in the world?!

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.166
How did you get
Shadow Maker back?

00:06:59.166 --> 00:07:01.266
(devious laughter)

00:07:01.266 --> 00:07:02.500
Yeah!

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:05.066
Shay used it to Xyz Summon
Revolution Falcon.

00:07:05.066 --> 00:07:07.266
Gong's very confused.

00:07:07.266 --> 00:07:10.800
Perhaps a little bit
of explanation is in order.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.333
Right when you took control
of Shadow Maker,

00:07:13.333 --> 00:07:15.100
I used one
of its Overlay Units

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:18.266
to summon a new Shadow Maker
from my Extra Deck.

00:07:18.266 --> 00:07:21.200
(devious laughter)

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.800
All squads...

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.466
Give me a status update.

00:07:24.466 --> 00:07:26.366
<i>Squad Ais in position.</i>

00:07:26.366 --> 00:07:29.766
Squad B is ready
as well, sir.

00:07:29.766 --> 00:07:33.766
Squad C here‐‐ we have
the area cordoned off.

00:07:33.766 --> 00:07:35.833
And what of our special guests?

00:07:35.833 --> 00:07:37.433
They'll all besafely
off the premises

00:07:37.433 --> 00:07:38.466
<i>within three minutes.</i>

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:43.800
Fine. Then it's three minutes
until these Commons

00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.933
have their
last taste of freedom.

00:07:58.125 --> 00:08:00.210
(devious laughter)

00:08:00.210 --> 00:08:03.077
Shay! You're gonna need
a miracle to survive!

00:08:10.977 --> 00:08:11.910
(gasping)
(gasping)

00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:14.577
Aah!

00:08:14.577 --> 00:08:17.144
Aah! Aah!

00:08:19.377 --> 00:08:22.710
(alarm whooping)

00:08:22.710 --> 00:08:24.910
<i>This is Sector Security.</i>

for taking part
in underground Turbo Duels.

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.277
Do not resist or you will be
severely punished.

00:08:32.277 --> 00:08:33.344
<i>Remain where you are</i>

00:08:33.344 --> 00:08:35.377
and prepare to be processed,
lawbreakers!

00:08:40.677 --> 00:08:42.010
(whimpers)

00:08:45.844 --> 00:08:47.944
Hey! Wait!

00:08:49.010 --> 00:08:50.477
Freeze!

00:08:50.477 --> 00:08:52.044
Aah...

00:08:52.044 --> 00:08:53.977
Nuts!

00:08:53.977 --> 00:08:57.044
Good news, sir,
we have all the hooligans

00:08:57.044 --> 00:09:00.077
involved in the underground
Turbo Duels in custody,

00:09:00.077 --> 00:09:02.444
including the two riders
and their friend

00:09:02.444 --> 00:09:03.944
<i>that you had your eye on.</i>

00:09:03.944 --> 00:09:05.477
Good to hear.

00:09:05.477 --> 00:09:07.944
But don't rest on your
laurels yet, Commander,

00:09:07.944 --> 00:09:10.110
there's more work to be done.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.510
After all,
as you well know,

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:14.044
these three duelists

00:09:14.044 --> 00:09:16.777
aren't the only ones
on my most wanted list...

00:09:16.777 --> 00:09:19.110
and I want them all
apprehended.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:20.510
Do it now.

00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.044
<i>Right away, sir.</i>

00:09:23.044 --> 00:09:24.710
(chuckles)

00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.877
The pieces
are coming into place.

00:09:30.744 --> 00:09:32.444
I Synchro Summon!

00:09:32.444 --> 00:09:36.077
No way! To Synchro Summon
you need a Tuner monster!

00:09:36.077 --> 00:09:38.710
Aw, man... I was hoping
you wouldn't notice!

00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:40.144
So you were cheating?!

00:09:40.144 --> 00:09:42.144
No, just trying to cheat.

00:09:42.144 --> 00:09:43.844
I miss... Declan.

00:09:43.844 --> 00:09:45.544
Fine! I won't ever
do it again...

00:09:45.544 --> 00:09:46.710
this match.

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:48.077
Hey, you guys.

00:09:48.077 --> 00:09:50.610
Has anyone seen
Celina or Sylvio?

00:09:50.610 --> 00:09:53.410
The scary girl
and that snobby guy? No.

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:56.010
Me neither.
They're not inside?

00:09:56.010 --> 00:09:59.410
No. They must've headed out
to search for our friends.

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:01.110
I know how they're feeling,

00:10:01.110 --> 00:10:03.410
but it's just not safe
right now.

00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:06.010
Can't have security
nabbing any of us.

00:10:06.010 --> 00:10:08.344
There's just
far too much at stake.

00:10:08.344 --> 00:10:11.744
(worried)
Oh... oh... oh!

00:10:11.744 --> 00:10:12.877
Unh!

00:10:12.877 --> 00:10:15.244
Uh, Riley? You okay?

00:10:15.244 --> 00:10:17.910
I'm going to find Declan.

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:19.544
Hold up!

00:10:19.544 --> 00:10:22.477
Riley, didn't you
just hear me?

00:10:22.477 --> 00:10:24.944
We can't be
wandering around.

00:10:24.944 --> 00:10:27.577
I don't care.

00:10:27.577 --> 00:10:29.444
Look, I know
how important it is

00:10:29.444 --> 00:10:31.677
that you find Declan...

00:10:31.677 --> 00:10:34.077
but that's
why you should wait.

00:10:34.077 --> 00:10:37.677
Until we have a better
chance of finding him.

00:10:37.677 --> 00:10:39.610
Now, don't worry.

00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:43.044
It'll be soon, Riley,
you have my word.

00:10:43.044 --> 00:10:45.110
♪

00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.210
Okay, Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:48.677
Dance your way...

00:10:48.677 --> 00:10:50.377
to victory!

00:10:52.044 --> 00:10:53.444
Aah...!

00:10:57.677 --> 00:10:59.877
(Sylvio, clapping slowly)
Bravo...

00:10:59.877 --> 00:11:02.044
I can't believe
it took you

00:11:02.044 --> 00:11:05.077
three moves to beat him.

00:11:05.077 --> 00:11:06.910
How much time
are you going to waste

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:08.744
dueling these losers?

00:11:08.744 --> 00:11:11.744
I thought you were out here
to find Zuzu.

00:11:11.744 --> 00:11:13.444
I do want to find her,

00:11:13.444 --> 00:11:15.977
but our mission
is also to find duelists

00:11:15.977 --> 00:11:17.377
that are skilled enough

00:11:17.377 --> 00:11:19.177
to take on
the Fusion Dimension.

00:11:20.777 --> 00:11:24.610
Now... who's the very best
duelist that you know of?

00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:28.777
Uh, well, that guy.

00:11:28.777 --> 00:11:30.310
Jack Atlas?

00:11:30.310 --> 00:11:32.310
Must be some kinda
duel celebrity

00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:33.510
around these parts.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.944
(Celina)
Perfect.

00:11:34.944 --> 00:11:36.544
Then he's up next.

00:11:36.544 --> 00:11:38.244
I got something.

00:11:38.244 --> 00:11:39.677
Yeah, the girl.

00:11:39.677 --> 00:11:42.244
The one who escaped from
our dragnet the other day.

00:11:42.244 --> 00:11:44.677
The whiny one
is with her as well.

00:11:44.677 --> 00:11:47.577
Excellent‐‐ but don't
arrest them just yet.

00:11:47.577 --> 00:11:50.577
I want you to follow them
and see where they lead you.

00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:54.310
And even more importantly,
whom they might lead you to.

00:12:06.322 --> 00:12:07.589
(Crow)
You're kidding me.

00:12:07.589 --> 00:12:09.689
Celina and Sylvio
took off again?

00:12:09.689 --> 00:12:10.922
Yeah.

00:12:10.922 --> 00:12:14.022
Man, I thought I made it
clear to them to stay put!

00:12:14.022 --> 00:12:15.589
I know...

00:12:15.589 --> 00:12:17.555
Guess they've made it clear
they don't care.

00:12:17.555 --> 00:12:18.822
(footsteps)

00:12:18.822 --> 00:12:19.755
Huh?
Huh?

00:12:19.755 --> 00:12:21.489
I'm back, Crow,

00:12:21.489 --> 00:12:24.422
and I got
some good stuff, too... huh?

00:12:24.422 --> 00:12:27.022
Security's still got you
trapped, huh?

00:12:27.022 --> 00:12:29.055
Yeah, they don't let up.

00:12:29.055 --> 00:12:30.455
It'll blow over.

00:12:30.455 --> 00:12:32.322
Uh? Thanks again
for helping us

00:12:32.322 --> 00:12:35.322
get away from those
security goons before.

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.589
Yeah, well, if they're
still after you,

00:12:37.589 --> 00:12:39.955
we can't be bringing the heat
down on the kids..

00:12:39.955 --> 00:12:41.789
I understand.

00:12:41.789 --> 00:12:43.022
(door opens)

00:12:43.022 --> 00:12:44.655
Shinji, you're home!

00:12:44.655 --> 00:12:46.489
Shinji!
Shinji!

00:12:46.489 --> 00:12:49.455
(Shinji)
Here‐‐ check out
what I brought you kids!

00:12:49.455 --> 00:12:51.422
Oh!
Oh!
Oh!

00:12:51.422 --> 00:12:52.722
It all looks so yummy!

00:12:52.722 --> 00:12:54.255
It's too good to be true!

00:12:54.255 --> 00:12:55.855
I must be dreaming!

00:12:55.855 --> 00:12:57.255
I wish there was more

00:12:57.255 --> 00:12:59.422
but these were all the snacks
I could carry back.

00:12:59.422 --> 00:13:00.689
Mm‐hmm...
Mm‐hmm...

00:13:00.689 --> 00:13:03.022
What? If I hadn't eaten
the four choco‐choco bars

00:13:03.022 --> 00:13:04.989
then the bag would have ripped.

00:13:04.989 --> 00:13:07.422
Enough with the guilt...
dig in!

00:13:07.422 --> 00:13:10.189
Oh, hey, why don't you come over
and join us too, sport?

00:13:10.189 --> 00:13:11.789
There's plenty to go around.

00:13:11.789 --> 00:13:13.789
Especially when it comes
to donuts.

00:13:13.789 --> 00:13:15.022
Get it?
'Cause they're round?

00:13:15.022 --> 00:13:17.322
Anyway‐‐ I'm off.

00:13:17.322 --> 00:13:18.822
Thanks again, Shinji.

00:13:18.822 --> 00:13:21.555
No problem‐‐
just promise me
you'll be careful.

00:13:21.555 --> 00:13:23.889
I haven't seen Sector
Security this riled up

00:13:23.889 --> 00:13:26.155
since you let all the air
out of their runners.

00:13:26.155 --> 00:13:27.522
(Crow)
C'mon, it's me!

00:13:27.522 --> 00:13:29.055
I'm always careful!

00:13:29.055 --> 00:13:30.055
(kids)
Bye!

00:13:37.589 --> 00:13:38.789
Ah... mmm...

00:13:38.789 --> 00:13:40.489
Oh...
mmm...

00:13:40.489 --> 00:13:42.322
Riley? Dig in.

00:13:42.322 --> 00:13:44.455
Who? Me? Well, uh...

00:13:44.455 --> 00:13:47.522
Better hurry up before
these jackals eat it all!

00:13:47.522 --> 00:13:49.622
Look, it's cool.

00:13:49.622 --> 00:13:51.589
You don't
have to be afraid.

00:13:51.589 --> 00:13:53.255
You're safe here.

00:13:53.255 --> 00:13:54.889
Loosen up.

00:13:54.889 --> 00:13:57.055
It's Shinji's donut joke,
isn't it?

00:13:57.055 --> 00:13:58.355
You're still recovering.

00:13:58.355 --> 00:14:00.322
No more jokes, I promise.

00:14:00.322 --> 00:14:01.889
But if he does try
to tell you

00:14:01.889 --> 00:14:04.289
a knock‐knock joke,
just do what I do and yell

00:14:04.289 --> 00:14:06.022
"No one's home!"

00:14:06.022 --> 00:14:07.055
Now, come on
out of there

00:14:07.055 --> 00:14:08.689
and chow down
with the others.

00:14:08.689 --> 00:14:10.055
That's an order,
mister!

00:14:10.055 --> 00:14:11.622
There's still plenty left!

00:14:11.622 --> 00:14:13.422
But I'd hurry if I were you‐‐

00:14:13.422 --> 00:14:16.089
those kids think
that since they got two hands

00:14:16.089 --> 00:14:17.722
they gotta eat twice as fast.

00:14:17.722 --> 00:14:19.289
Just watch your fingers.

00:14:20.822 --> 00:14:24.355
Now, go wash up
so you can chow down.

00:14:27.722 --> 00:14:28.922
Jackals!

00:14:28.922 --> 00:14:30.589
Go and wash your paws, too!

00:14:30.589 --> 00:14:32.489
But... I like germs!

00:14:32.489 --> 00:14:34.522
I like germs, too!

00:14:34.522 --> 00:14:36.322
Uh‐huh, nice try.

00:14:36.322 --> 00:14:37.589
Can you be more like Riley

00:14:37.589 --> 00:14:40.089
and just follow orders
without the back and forth?

00:14:40.089 --> 00:14:41.755
(all)
Fine.

00:14:41.755 --> 00:14:44.689
Nice technique
there, Riley!

00:14:44.689 --> 00:14:46.255
Impressive lather!

00:14:46.255 --> 00:14:51.522
Tell me, Yuya, why is it
that Riley's so quiet?

00:14:51.522 --> 00:14:54.089
I wish I knew
the answer, Crow.

00:14:54.089 --> 00:14:56.789
So then it's a mystery.
Poor kid.

00:14:56.789 --> 00:14:59.889
Seems like Riley's wrestling
with some serious stuff.

00:14:59.889 --> 00:15:03.822
Has Riley always been
so shy and distant?

00:15:03.822 --> 00:15:05.022
Hmm...

00:15:05.022 --> 00:15:07.055
Sure seems like it.

00:15:07.055 --> 00:15:09.455
I would do anything
to get Riley to smile.

00:15:09.455 --> 00:15:12.522
That's what kids
should be doing.

00:15:12.522 --> 00:15:15.189
In fact, that's one of
the reasons I love dueling.

00:15:15.189 --> 00:15:19.322
To entertain people
so that they can be happy.

00:15:19.322 --> 00:15:22.022
Yeah... I know
just what you mean.

00:15:22.022 --> 00:15:24.322
When these kids watch me duel...

00:15:24.322 --> 00:15:27.155
they get super happy.

00:15:27.155 --> 00:15:28.489
Super happy?

00:15:28.489 --> 00:15:29.789
What's that supposed to mean?

00:15:29.789 --> 00:15:32.389
I'm just saying
I put on a good show.

00:15:32.389 --> 00:15:33.555
No offense, Crow,

00:15:33.555 --> 00:15:35.555
but when I comes
to putting on a good show...

00:15:35.555 --> 00:15:37.622
there's no one better than me.

00:15:37.622 --> 00:15:39.455
Well, offense taken, Yuya!

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.089
I'm more entertaining!

00:15:41.089 --> 00:15:42.555
No way‐‐ I am!

00:15:42.555 --> 00:15:44.222
I'll tell you
what's entertaining, Yuya:

00:15:44.222 --> 00:15:45.722
how clueless you are!

00:15:45.722 --> 00:15:47.122
Oh, really?!

00:15:47.122 --> 00:15:49.922
Well, you want me to tell you
what's entertaining about you?

00:15:49.922 --> 00:15:52.822
Nothing! I'd rather watch
paint dry than watch you duel!

00:15:52.822 --> 00:15:55.455
Fine, then‐‐ let's let
the kids settle this!

00:15:55.455 --> 00:15:57.122
Now, be honest.

00:15:57.122 --> 00:15:59.889
Me or Yuya‐‐ who would you
rather watch in a duel?

00:15:59.889 --> 00:16:01.089
Huh?

00:16:01.089 --> 00:16:03.689
Well? Break Yuya
the news. It's me!

00:16:03.689 --> 00:16:04.922
Riley?!

00:16:04.922 --> 00:16:06.455
Huh?

00:16:06.455 --> 00:16:08.322
Ha! It's me,
isn't it, Riley?

00:16:08.322 --> 00:16:09.255
Oh, yeah!

00:16:09.255 --> 00:16:11.955
Don't try
and lead the witness!

00:16:11.955 --> 00:16:13.422
Tell him, Riley, it's me!

00:16:13.422 --> 00:16:15.122
It's me!
It's me!

00:16:15.122 --> 00:16:16.289
It's me!

00:16:16.289 --> 00:16:18.289
There's only one way
to settle this, Yuya.

00:16:18.289 --> 00:16:19.622
Let's duel!

00:16:19.622 --> 00:16:20.822
Then the kids'll watch

00:16:20.822 --> 00:16:22.789
and decide who puts on
the best show!

00:16:22.789 --> 00:16:23.955
You're on!

00:16:23.955 --> 00:16:25.289
If only so we can
stop arguing,

00:16:25.289 --> 00:16:27.322
because‐‐ phew‐‐
I'm exhausted!

00:16:32.422 --> 00:16:33.589
Plenty of posters

00:16:33.589 --> 00:16:35.255
but no sign
of the man himself.

00:16:35.255 --> 00:16:37.989
I know, and we've looked
pretty much everywhere.

00:16:37.989 --> 00:16:39.755
Hmm?

00:16:42.489 --> 00:16:45.289
Guess we're not the only ones
looking for something.

00:16:45.289 --> 00:16:46.922
No doubt.

00:16:46.922 --> 00:16:49.689
Think it's time...
we head on back now.

00:16:53.622 --> 00:16:56.589
Think you got what it takes
to make this crowd go ga‐ga?

00:16:56.589 --> 00:16:58.455
Well, prove it, Yuya!

00:16:58.455 --> 00:17:01.489
Oh, I will, by putting on
the most dueltaining duel

00:17:01.489 --> 00:17:03.055
anyone has ever seen!

00:17:03.055 --> 00:17:05.055
Oh, yeah?
Oh, yeah!

00:17:05.055 --> 00:17:07.489
Anyone else feel like
we're the adults here

00:17:07.489 --> 00:17:08.822
And they're the kids?

00:17:08.822 --> 00:17:11.055
Yeah, that
pretty much
sums it up.

00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:12.455
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:17:23.284 --> 00:17:25.117
Generating
Action Field...

00:17:25.117 --> 00:17:27.850
Crossover.
♪

00:17:32.437 --> 00:17:34.370
<i>Action Cards dispersed.</i>

00:17:34.370 --> 00:17:36.104
Allow me to go first.

00:17:36.104 --> 00:17:38.804
Ladies and gentlemen!

00:17:38.804 --> 00:17:41.104
Uh, is he talking to us?

00:17:41.104 --> 00:17:42.970
You're about to witness...

00:17:42.970 --> 00:17:44.804
theatrics,
the likes of which

00:17:44.804 --> 00:17:46.837
you have not ever seen before.

00:17:46.837 --> 00:17:49.570
Prepare for my
Pendulum Monsters!

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:51.037
Pendulum Monsters?!

00:17:51.037 --> 00:17:52.137
Sounds cool!

00:17:52.137 --> 00:17:53.604
This is a show!

00:17:53.604 --> 00:17:56.670
That's right and it begins
right here and now!

00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:58.904
Let's see what you got, Yuya.

00:17:58.904 --> 00:18:00.737
I got star power!

00:18:00.737 --> 00:18:03.737
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:18:03.737 --> 00:18:05.404
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:18:05.404 --> 00:18:08.337
I'm taking control of this duel
starting now!

00:18:17.504 --> 00:18:20.870
I'm allowed to summon monsters
from Level 2 through 7

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:22.637
all at the same time!

00:18:22.637 --> 00:18:23.804
(Frankie)
Awesome!

00:18:23.804 --> 00:18:25.304
(Terron)
So cool!

00:18:25.304 --> 00:18:27.237
Swing far, Pendulum.

00:18:27.237 --> 00:18:31.237
Carve the arc of victory!

00:18:31.237 --> 00:18:35.304
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:18:38.437 --> 00:18:41.237
Scratch your way to victory,
Performapal Silver Claw!

00:18:41.237 --> 00:18:44.637
Earn your stripes,
Performapal Salutiger!

00:18:44.637 --> 00:18:47.570
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:50.604
(roars)

00:18:50.604 --> 00:18:52.070
Oh, wow!

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:53.670
He summoned three at once!

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:55.304
Bravo!

00:18:55.304 --> 00:18:57.404
See those smiles
on their faces?

00:18:57.404 --> 00:18:59.837
I believe that's what
you call entertained!

00:18:59.837 --> 00:19:02.437
So I do believe
I've proven my point!

00:19:02.437 --> 00:19:04.104
(happy laughter)

00:19:04.104 --> 00:19:05.570
Way to go, Yuya!

00:19:05.570 --> 00:19:07.170
That was so cool!

00:19:07.170 --> 00:19:09.070
Don't take your bows just yet‐‐

00:19:09.070 --> 00:19:11.070
I still have
my move to make!

00:19:11.070 --> 00:19:13.537
And I can't wait to see
how it stacks up...

00:19:13.537 --> 00:19:16.037
so I end my turn‐‐
it's your go!

00:19:18.470 --> 00:19:19.970
Why are they dueling?

00:19:19.970 --> 00:19:21.137
Maybe they want to see

00:19:21.137 --> 00:19:22.804
who the second‐best
duelist

00:19:22.804 --> 00:19:25.070
in this dimension
is‐‐ behind me.

00:19:25.070 --> 00:19:28.804
Okay‐‐ time to show you
how the Crow flies!

00:19:28.804 --> 00:19:30.004
Here we go!

00:19:30.004 --> 00:19:31.570
Since I don't have
any cards out,

00:19:31.570 --> 00:19:34.870
I'm allowed to summon
Blackwing ‐ Gust The Backblast

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.137
to ruffle your feathers!

00:19:37.137 --> 00:19:38.204
(big shriek)

00:19:40.237 --> 00:19:43.670
Yuya, birds of a feather
like to flock together...

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:46.470
so since I already have
a Blackwing,

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:48.104
I can also summon...

00:19:48.104 --> 00:19:50.470
Blackwing ‐ Oroshi The Squall!

00:19:50.470 --> 00:19:51.537
(shrieking)

00:19:53.137 --> 00:19:56.437
Just like that, Crow
has two monsters, ready to go!

00:19:56.437 --> 00:19:59.170
Next, I tribute
Oroshi The Squall...

00:19:59.170 --> 00:20:02.704
So I can summon Assault
Blackwing ‐ Kunai The Drizzle!

00:20:02.704 --> 00:20:04.204
(scary shriek)

00:20:04.204 --> 00:20:05.204
You see, Yuya?

00:20:05.204 --> 00:20:06.537
You're not the only one

00:20:06.537 --> 00:20:09.270
who can summon multiple monsters
on their first turn.

00:20:09.270 --> 00:20:10.704
You're right
about that, Crow.

00:20:10.704 --> 00:20:12.270
You're making this
interesting.

00:20:12.270 --> 00:20:14.737
Ha‐‐ and it's only
gonna get more so!

00:20:14.737 --> 00:20:16.204
'Cause now I'm gonna
Synchro Summon!

00:20:16.204 --> 00:20:18.170
Huh? But how?

00:20:18.170 --> 00:20:19.770
You don't have a single
Tuner Monster

00:20:19.770 --> 00:20:21.104
out on your field.

00:20:21.104 --> 00:20:23.137
Not yet I don't, Yuya...

00:20:23.137 --> 00:20:26.004
but that's about to change
here and now!

00:20:26.004 --> 00:20:29.037
Since I tributed a Blackwing
to summon Kunai,

00:20:29.037 --> 00:20:31.970
Kunai transforms
into a Tuner Monster!

00:20:31.970 --> 00:20:34.570
Level 5 Kunai The Drizzle
tunes...

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.537
Level 2 Gust The Backblast!

00:20:39.604 --> 00:20:41.437
And by way of their cosmic bond

00:20:41.437 --> 00:20:43.937
I can now forge
an even mightier beast.

00:20:48.104 --> 00:20:49.804
I Synchro Summon!

00:20:49.804 --> 00:20:52.304
Spread your wings,
Assault Blackwing‐‐

00:20:52.304 --> 00:20:54.670
Raikiri The Rain Shower!

00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.304
Synchro Summoning's
the best!

00:20:56.304 --> 00:20:58.470
I don't know‐‐
Pendulum's pretty
cool too!

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.637
Oh, yeah?

00:20:59.637 --> 00:21:01.470
So then you're
gonna side
with Yuya?

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.570
C'mon, Crow's monster
is so cool!

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:05.404
You do have a point...

00:21:05.404 --> 00:21:08.170
Hey, Riley,
whose side are
you on so far?

00:21:08.170 --> 00:21:09.937
Gotta be Yuya's‐‐
am I right?

00:21:09.937 --> 00:21:12.537
Of course you're right‐‐
go on and tell 'em, Riley!

00:21:12.537 --> 00:21:15.237
Uh...

00:21:15.237 --> 00:21:17.704
Uh... or not.

00:21:17.704 --> 00:21:19.304
(laughs)

00:21:19.304 --> 00:21:21.504
I knew that Riley
was a bright kid!

00:21:21.504 --> 00:21:23.670
You're siding with me,
aren't ya, smart stuff?

00:21:23.670 --> 00:21:25.404
Uh...

00:21:25.404 --> 00:21:26.504
Mm...

00:21:26.504 --> 00:21:27.937
Or not.

00:21:27.937 --> 00:21:29.037
(Shinji)
Crow!

00:21:29.037 --> 00:21:30.304
Huh?

00:21:30.304 --> 00:21:31.970
Sector Security
is heading this way!

00:21:31.970 --> 00:21:33.570
Run for it!

00:21:33.570 --> 00:21:34.837
How'd they find us?

00:21:34.837 --> 00:21:36.337
They must've followed us here.

00:21:38.437 --> 00:21:40.504
Get down! Unh!

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.504
Huh? Ooh!

00:21:46.504 --> 00:21:48.637
(siren whooping)

00:21:48.637 --> 00:21:49.804
Blast it!

00:21:49.804 --> 00:21:50.970
(angry growl)

00:21:53.537 --> 00:21:55.737
Huh... huh! Unh!

00:21:55.737 --> 00:21:56.737
Unh...

00:21:56.737 --> 00:21:58.304
Let me go!

00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.370
Hunh!

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.737
Huh? Riley?!

00:22:08.737 --> 00:22:10.237
(all)
Ohh... aah...

00:22:10.237 --> 00:22:11.537
Where's Riley?

00:22:11.537 --> 00:22:13.037
Riley?!

00:22:13.037 --> 00:22:15.237
Leave the kids alone,
ya big bullies!

00:22:15.237 --> 00:22:16.637
