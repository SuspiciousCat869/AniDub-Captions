(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC V..."

00:00:04.466 --> 00:00:05.633
(Officer)
She's gone, sir.

00:00:05.633 --> 00:00:07.400
So far there's no
trace of her.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.966
(Jean Michel Roget)
After that impact, there's no
way she could've gotten away

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.866
on her own.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:14.566
Zuzu's okay.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:16.133
So just chill.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:18.100
I got her tucked away
safe and sound.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.933
So no need to lose
your cool or anything.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:23.400
Boy, that's
a relief.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.866
I'm so glad
you found her.

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.400
Look out!

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.733
Yuya!

00:00:30.733 --> 00:00:32.333
Time is
of the essence.

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:34.900
You must be aware that
Duel Academy could strike

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:38.433
at any moment, and
your friend Zuzu.

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.633
If you want to protect
her and Celina,

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:43.166
then it's in your best
interest to team with me.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.466
I'll never
join you, Roget.

00:00:49.466 --> 00:00:51.766
Zuzu Boyle was spotted
at the track.

00:00:51.766 --> 00:00:53.333
Capture her
immediately.

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:54.500
No!

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.833
You better
leave Zuzu alone!

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:01.133
I knew I couldn't
trust you Roget,

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:04.000
I won't let you
hurt my friends!

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.933
If you do then
you'll answer to me!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.166
(Sora)
I better find Zuzu soon, before
it's too late for both of us!

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.533
(man)

(Yuya)
Roget knows where Zuzu is...

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.400
He's gonna get to her unless
Sora gets to her first.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.200
At Duel Academy, I had
classmates, but I don't know

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.433
if I had any friends.

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:37.933
There was no time for that.

00:02:37.933 --> 00:02:39.766
But then when I met
you and Zuzu,

00:02:39.766 --> 00:02:42.933
I felt like I finally
had my first real friends.

00:02:42.933 --> 00:02:44.333
Sora...

00:02:44.333 --> 00:02:46.100
That's why I can't
let them get her.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.266
I won't let
them get her.

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:52.000
You have to find Zuzu
before Security does.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.500
You just have to.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.933
If anything were to happen to
her, I'd never forgive myself.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.400
(Sora)
Zuzu, where'd you
run off to?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.100
(siren approaching)

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:08.966
Copy that...

00:03:08.966 --> 00:03:12.233
We'll pick up
Zuzu Boyle ASAP.

00:03:12.233 --> 00:03:15.100
Security's got the lowdown
on Zuzu's locale.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.466
Time to play
follow the leader.

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:24.000
Right clear!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.166
Left clear!

00:03:25.166 --> 00:03:26.633
Center clear!

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:28.666
Let's do it, Zuzu!

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.200
When you say """let's do
it," you don't...

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.433
(all three)
Go!

00:03:32.433 --> 00:03:34.766
...mean jumping all
the way down there, do ya?

00:03:34.766 --> 00:03:36.966
You're taller so you don't
have to fall as far!

00:03:36.966 --> 00:03:38.500
(Amanda)
Yeah, Zuzu, come on!

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.900
(Terron)
Hurry up!

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.266
(groaning)

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.966
I didn't fall as far,
but I fell harder.

00:03:49.966 --> 00:03:51.200
That jump's nothin'!

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.733
I guess Crow
winning that duel

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.633
gave us a lot
of extra energy!

00:03:54.633 --> 00:03:55.833
Yeah.

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:56.900
Their match was just,
so awesome.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.400
How could we not
get pumped up?

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.933
Yeah, stuff like
that makes me feel

00:03:59.933 --> 00:04:01.566
like I can jump
to the moon!

00:04:01.566 --> 00:04:03.766
Man, someday I'm gonna
get myself one of those

00:04:03.766 --> 00:04:06.600
way cool Runners and do
jumps and pop wheelies!

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:07.600
Me, too!

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.733
And me three!

00:04:08.733 --> 00:04:10.533
(man)
That's a pretty
dream, kids.

00:04:10.533 --> 00:04:13.266
Too bad it'll
never come true.

00:04:13.266 --> 00:04:14.500
It's security!

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.600
Oh, no!

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.000
(man 2)
Zuzu Boyle...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.300
(Zuzu)
What do you want?

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.633
We have you
surrounded.

00:04:19.633 --> 00:04:23.066
♪

00:04:27.466 --> 00:04:29.000
(man 2)
Zuzu Boyle...

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.733
(Zuzu)
What do you want?

00:04:30.733 --> 00:04:35.000
We have you
surrounded.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.500
Not a hundred percent.

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.600
I spy a way out!

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.766
Then let's
shake our caboose!

00:04:41.766 --> 00:04:44.366
Go!

00:04:44.366 --> 00:04:45.933
Typical criminal.

00:04:45.933 --> 00:04:47.733
Fleeing the scene
of a crime!

00:04:50.766 --> 00:04:54.133
Your little escape route
is nothing but a dead end!

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:56.033
You're mine,
twerps!

00:04:56.033 --> 00:04:57.800
Arrest them
Goyo Predator!

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.633
Director, we have the fugitive
and her accomplices in custody.

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:06.100
(Jean Michel Roget)
<i>Well done.</i>

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.233
Bring them
in immediately.

00:05:08.233 --> 00:05:09.600
Yes, sir!

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.233
I'll come
along quietly,

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:14.566
so please can't you
let these kids go?

00:05:14.566 --> 00:05:15.966
They have...

00:05:15.966 --> 00:05:18.800
Nothing to do
with any of this.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.433
Oh, yes we
do, Zuzu.

00:05:20.433 --> 00:05:22.133
You're our friend, we're
not gonna stand around

00:05:22.133 --> 00:05:23.866
and do nothing.

00:05:23.866 --> 00:05:26.766
We're not letting 'em take you
anywhere, not now, not later,

00:05:26.766 --> 00:05:27.900
not ever!

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.900
We're stickin' to
you like forever glue!

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:34.066
Thanks, guys.

00:05:34.066 --> 00:05:35.766
But no...

00:05:35.766 --> 00:05:38.233
If I only had
a Duel Disk...

00:05:38.233 --> 00:05:39.666
You want Zuzu?

00:05:39.666 --> 00:05:41.633
You're gonna have to
get through us first!

00:05:41.633 --> 00:05:43.666
Yeah, we're gonna
bop you cops!

00:05:43.666 --> 00:05:44.966
(man)
Heh.

00:05:44.966 --> 00:05:47.866
That's some big talk
coming from such small fries!

00:05:47.866 --> 00:05:49.600
Yuya...

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.733
(Sora)
Heads up!

00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:58.900
(Zuzu)
Sora!

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:00.400
Looks like I'm late
to the party,

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:03.533
hope you don't
mind if I drop in!

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:05.233
And I brought
a plus one!

00:06:10.666 --> 00:06:13.000
This is my buddy...

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.100
Frightfur Chimera!

00:06:23.466 --> 00:06:26.200
And it brought you
a housewarming gift!

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.700
Don't you coppers have
some tickets to write

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:37.866
or doughnuts to eat?

00:06:37.866 --> 00:06:39.000
Sora...

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.333
What're you
doing here?

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.800
Let's see if we get
out of this first

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.800
and we can chit
chat about that later!

00:06:46.833 --> 00:06:48.000
Right.

00:06:51.466 --> 00:06:56.000
Time for
their swan song!

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.733
To start things off
on the right note,

00:06:57.733 --> 00:07:01.333
I'm blending the vocal stylings
of three Melodious monsters

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:03.033
to bring out a
singing sensation

00:07:03.033 --> 00:07:05.333
who can really
belt one out!

00:07:12.033 --> 00:07:14.100
Give it up for...

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:17.700
the blossoming beauty, Bloom
Prima the Melodious Choir!

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.100
But don't let her
beauty fool you,

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:27.100
When she's in perfect harmony
her voice will blow you away!

00:07:29.233 --> 00:07:31.400
You're on,
Bloom Prima!

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.600
Hit it!

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.800
(groaning)

00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:40.133
(all)
All right!

00:07:40.133 --> 00:07:42.200
How 'bout an encore?

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.366
You heard him!

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:46.000
Bloom Prima, floor
these coppers for good!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.366
Wrecking Refrain!

00:07:54.333 --> 00:07:55.633
There's our
opening guys!

00:07:55.633 --> 00:07:56.866
Move it!

00:07:56.866 --> 00:07:59.100
Let's go!

00:07:59.100 --> 00:08:01.933
Escape is not...
an option!

00:08:01.933 --> 00:08:04.566
You're all going to be singing
the blues in The Facility!

00:08:06.300 --> 00:08:07.433
(Zuzu)
No chance!

00:08:07.433 --> 00:08:09.033
If you think you're gonna
send us away,

00:08:09.033 --> 00:08:11.300
you're gonna have
to catch us first!

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.433
That's exactly what
I plan on doing!

00:08:13.433 --> 00:08:15.233
Goyo Predator...

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:16.800
(growling)

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.300
Get your prey!

00:08:23.266 --> 00:08:25.866
There's no outrunning
the long arm of the law!

00:08:25.866 --> 00:08:28.333
...you're mine!

00:08:28.333 --> 00:08:30.066
Not if I
can help it!

00:08:30.066 --> 00:08:34.433
Fusion Fright Waltz will
put an end to your pursuit!

00:08:34.433 --> 00:08:38.300
Sorry coppers, but this
dance card's all filled up!

00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:40.400
Our monsters are partnering
up their attack points

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:42.400
and dancing their
way to victory!

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.200
Victory?

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.666
Yeah so watch this pair dance
the two‐step all over you!

00:08:49.666 --> 00:08:50.900
Now...

00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.200
Places please,
Chimera!

00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:55.966
Center stage,
Bloom Prima!

00:08:55.966 --> 00:08:58.833
It's just about time
for the big finale...

00:08:58.833 --> 00:09:02.100
And the only ones in
the spotlight are you!

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.966
Bloom Prima, Chimera!

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:07.766
First our two dance
partners will politely meet!

00:09:07.766 --> 00:09:11.200
Then they cut loose, party,
and move their feet!

00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:12.700
Now let's give
this dance a whirl...

00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:13.833
Easy, though!

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:15.200
No one wants
to hurl.

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.500
You'll start to grin!

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.700
Crack a Smile,
smirk and spin!

00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:21.833
Bystanders gasp in
shock and awe.

00:09:21.833 --> 00:09:23.966
Three of which
are young and small.

00:09:23.966 --> 00:09:26.366
So since you're not
paying attention...

00:09:26.366 --> 00:09:29.233
I think it's a
good time to mention...

00:09:29.233 --> 00:09:32.133
Your Monster just
got destroyed!

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:34.200
Bet that'll
get you annoyed!

00:09:34.200 --> 00:09:36.833
It was the first of three
to be wiped out!

00:09:36.833 --> 00:09:39.500
Which brings us closer
to winning this bout!

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:42.633
My monsters do
hope you've all had fun.

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:47.133
Because our dynamic dance
is now fully done!

00:09:47.133 --> 00:09:48.300
Whoops!

00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:50.500
We almost
forgot about you!

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.166
But now that you're beat,
we've won

00:09:53.166 --> 00:09:54.766
and this duel
is thoroughly through!

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.466
Thanks, Sora!

00:10:02.466 --> 00:10:03.633
What a show!

00:10:03.633 --> 00:10:04.633
Come on, Zuzu!

00:10:04.633 --> 00:10:05.733
Let's get it
in gear!

00:10:05.733 --> 00:10:06.733
Right!

00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:08.133
Hurry, Sora!

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:12.033
(groaning)

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:17.000
You told me they
were in custody!

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.133
<i>Yes, Director...</i>

00:10:19.133 --> 00:10:22.233
But some kid who Fusion
Summon got in our way.

00:10:22.233 --> 00:10:23.900
Fusion...

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:26.400
It must
be Sora.

00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:28.366
Attention Security.

00:10:28.366 --> 00:10:31.166
Zuzu Boyle hasevaded
apprehension.

00:10:31.166 --> 00:10:34.133
She is on the run
andshe is not alone.

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:37.000
If you spot her, arrest
her on sight.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:40.166
<i>Use any means necessary.</i>

00:10:40.166 --> 00:10:43.733
And when I say by any means,
I mean by any means!

00:10:47.466 --> 00:10:48.666
You search
down there!

00:10:48.666 --> 00:10:50.366
Don't let her
get away!

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.033
They gone?

00:10:55.033 --> 00:10:56.233
Think so.

00:10:56.233 --> 00:10:57.966
Ha!
I know so.

00:10:57.966 --> 00:10:59.133
They're clueless.

00:10:59.133 --> 00:11:00.866
You know, I never got
the chance to say thanks

00:11:00.866 --> 00:11:03.166
for pulling me out
of that building.

00:11:03.166 --> 00:11:04.566
That was you?

00:11:04.566 --> 00:11:06.100
You're a hero.

00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:07.233
What's your name?

00:11:07.233 --> 00:11:08.966
Should we call you
super something?

00:11:08.966 --> 00:11:12.033
(Terron)
Yeah! And it's
gotta sound super cool!

00:11:12.033 --> 00:11:15.566
(Sora)
Not super
duper cool?

00:11:15.566 --> 00:11:17.533
This is my friend
Sora!

00:11:17.533 --> 00:11:18.566
Your friend?

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:20.000
Yep.

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.766
He's the one who taught me
all about Fusion Summoning!

00:11:22.766 --> 00:11:24.100
Wow...

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:25.200
He must be a
real good teacher

00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:28.000
cause' you two schooled
Security just now.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.633
When I saw both your
monsters dancing together,

00:11:30.633 --> 00:11:32.966
it was like watching
perfect partners!

00:11:32.966 --> 00:11:35.400
Seeing it was a
thing of beauty...

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:37.966
... Two monsters
kicking booty!

00:11:37.966 --> 00:11:41.266
They destroyed Security's
monsters one, two, three...

00:11:41.266 --> 00:11:43.133
...So now we're free!

00:11:43.133 --> 00:11:45.366
(Amanda)
Hey we sound
pretty good!

00:11:45.366 --> 00:11:47.200
(Terron)
I think Frankie
needs some work.

00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.366
Thanks for saving
me again.

00:11:49.366 --> 00:11:52.233
I'm always getting
you into trouble.

00:11:52.233 --> 00:11:54.633
If you hadn't run off
after the first time,

00:11:54.633 --> 00:11:57.200
I wouldn't have had to
save you the second time.

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:58.800
Yeah, I'm sorry...

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.466
But I didn't know what do
when I woke up by myself.

00:12:01.466 --> 00:12:05.633
Well, I guess it was my fault
for leaving you alone like that.

00:12:05.633 --> 00:12:08.300
But I only did it 'cause I
wanted to let Yuya know

00:12:08.300 --> 00:12:10.466
that you were okay
as quick as I could.

00:12:10.466 --> 00:12:12.900
So how's Yuya doing?

00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.866
We're not 100%
on that.

00:12:15.866 --> 00:12:19.100
After he beat Shinji,
we haven't seen him since.

00:12:19.100 --> 00:12:21.500
'Cause he probably took
off looking for you..

00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:22.900
Yeah...

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.466
But that didn't
turn out too good.

00:12:25.466 --> 00:12:27.933
I wanted to show him you
weren't in danger,

00:12:27.933 --> 00:12:29.466
but that led me to
putting him in danger!

00:12:30.933 --> 00:12:33.066
Look out!

00:12:33.066 --> 00:12:34.300
Yuya!

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.066
Get outta here!

00:12:36.066 --> 00:12:37.933
Take care
of Zuzu for me!

00:12:40.800 --> 00:12:42.433
That means...

00:12:42.433 --> 00:12:44.433
It's all my fault
Yuya's in trouble.

00:12:48.633 --> 00:12:51.600
Zuzu...

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:54.233
(man)
You want a cerebral
restrictor for Yuya?

00:12:54.233 --> 00:12:55.966
(Jean Michel Rochet)
Yes.

00:12:55.966 --> 00:12:59.100
The restrictor will allow me
to directly control him,

00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:01.600
the same way
I control Sergey.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.100
<i>Are you sure, Director?</i>

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.033
I mean, the one you
implanted in Sergey,

00:13:05.033 --> 00:13:07.400
the cerebral links
completely shorted out

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.100
and nearly cooked
his cranium.

00:13:09.100 --> 00:13:10.766
We're barely
able to repair it.

00:13:10.766 --> 00:13:12.700
Don't you think it's
too dangerous?

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.233
When will
it be ready?

00:13:15.233 --> 00:13:18.066
It'll take until
Midnight tonight.

00:13:18.066 --> 00:13:20.733
Then why are you wasting
time talking to me?

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.066
You have one hour!

00:13:22.066 --> 00:13:24.866
The restrictor must be
in place and functional

00:13:24.866 --> 00:13:28.166
for Yuya's match
tomorrow.

00:13:28.166 --> 00:13:28.966
<i>Yes...</i>

00:13:28.966 --> 00:13:31.533
I understood,
Director.

00:13:31.533 --> 00:13:33.700
(Jean Michel Roget)
I have no doubt
that Duel Academy

00:13:33.700 --> 00:13:35.533
will invade New Domino City

00:13:35.533 --> 00:13:39.133
and steal away everything
that I have built!

00:13:39.133 --> 00:13:43.100
But I cannot and
will not let that happen!

00:13:43.100 --> 00:13:47.866
To fight against them, I will
need both Sergey and Yuya

00:13:47.866 --> 00:13:49.900
to battle
under my control.

00:13:54.066 --> 00:13:55.566
I can't keep
running forever.

00:13:55.566 --> 00:13:57.800
I don't care
about Security.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:00.000
I have to go
help Yuya.

00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.366
No way,
no how, Zuzu!

00:14:02.366 --> 00:14:05.366
Security's everywhere
what if they grab ya?

00:14:05.366 --> 00:14:08.400
Yeah, and lock ya up
in The Facility forever?

00:14:08.400 --> 00:14:09.700
I know...

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.166
But that's a risk
I'm willing to take.

00:14:12.166 --> 00:14:15.500
You know why Security's
looking for you?

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:16.900
Sure I do.

00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.300
I lost my duel so they
want to send me underground.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:21.466
You think they sent this
whole Security force out

00:14:21.466 --> 00:14:24.166
just to find some
girl who lost a match?

00:14:24.166 --> 00:14:26.666
Then why am
I so special?

00:14:26.666 --> 00:14:30.033
They have to find you
before Duel Academy does.

00:14:30.033 --> 00:14:33.166
Duel Academy's going to invade
this world sooner than later

00:14:33.166 --> 00:14:35.000
and try to
take you away.

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.366
And I can't let
that happen.

00:14:37.366 --> 00:14:39.366
So you running around
trying to save Yuya

00:14:39.366 --> 00:14:41.433
isn't an
option right now.

00:14:41.433 --> 00:14:44.233
I'm not letting you out
of my sight again Zuzu.

00:14:44.233 --> 00:14:46.800
You're staying put.

00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:50.766
Sora... so you're
totally on our side now.

00:14:50.766 --> 00:14:53.066
And you're gonna fight
against Duel Academy?

00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:54.266
Well...

00:14:54.266 --> 00:14:56.333
Well what, Sora?

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:59.400
Are you or
aren't you?

00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:00.766
Look, Zuzu.

00:15:00.766 --> 00:15:03.900
Duel Academy's been my
home for my entire life.

00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.600
But you know what
they've done!

00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:08.533
You can't let the past
control what you do now.

00:15:08.533 --> 00:15:10.700
You have to fight for
what you think is right.

00:15:13.466 --> 00:15:15.500
You make it
sound so easy.

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.900
But I was brought up and
raised by Duel Academy.

00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:20.700
I was one of their
elite fighters.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.433
They taught me
everything I know.

00:15:23.433 --> 00:15:25.066
What's he
talking about?

00:15:25.066 --> 00:15:28.033
What's this Duel Academy
mumbo jumbo?

00:15:28.033 --> 00:15:29.966
I heard Zuzu say
somethin' about it

00:15:29.966 --> 00:15:33.133
and it sure
sounded scary.

00:15:33.133 --> 00:15:35.133
Yeah...
I remember.

00:15:35.133 --> 00:15:36.633
But these two
are friends.

00:15:36.633 --> 00:15:39.900
Why would Sora's people wanna
come here and attack us?

00:15:39.900 --> 00:15:41.533
We are friends.

00:15:41.533 --> 00:15:44.200
So that's why I'm
helping you out Zuzu.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:47.000
Even though the invasion
can't be stopped...

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.566
I can still
help you out.

00:15:49.566 --> 00:15:51.933
I should have done this
when I first found you.

00:15:51.933 --> 00:15:55.666
It was foolish of me to
wait and risk your safety.

00:15:55.666 --> 00:15:58.133
What're you doing?

00:15:58.133 --> 00:16:00.400
I'm sending
you home, Zuzu.

00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:03.066
Back to your family
and friends.

00:16:03.066 --> 00:16:04.400
Sora!

00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:05.833
No, you won't!

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:08.533
I'm not abandoning
my friends.

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:12.066
Either we all go home
together, or none of us go!

00:16:12.066 --> 00:16:13.900
That's the only way.

00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:15.733
I will not leave
my friends behind.

00:16:17.833 --> 00:16:21.900
Come on Zuzu, I know
how you feel but...

00:16:21.900 --> 00:16:23.000
Who's there?

00:16:27.666 --> 00:16:30.533
Who's there?

00:16:30.533 --> 00:16:32.666
It is I,
Moon Shadow.

00:16:32.666 --> 00:16:37.166
You may not know me, but
you know my brother Sun Shadow.

00:16:37.166 --> 00:16:39.300
You turned him into a card

00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:43.266
and now you will
pay for your actions.

00:16:43.266 --> 00:16:46.200
I know in my heart his
spirit led me here to you,

00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:50.200
finally face‐to‐face, so I
can battle to avenge him!

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.833
No, Moon Shadow!

00:16:51.833 --> 00:16:54.866
We're all on the same
team now, he's one of us!

00:16:54.866 --> 00:16:56.733
He is no ally
of mine!

00:16:56.733 --> 00:16:58.833
He is my
sworn enemy!

00:16:58.833 --> 00:17:00.166
Not anymore!

00:17:00.166 --> 00:17:01.666
Tell him, Sora...

00:17:01.666 --> 00:17:04.200
Tell him you don't do
stuff like that anymore!

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.466
Moon Shadow,
Sora's our friend.

00:17:06.466 --> 00:17:09.733
He saved me and he's trying
to get us all home.

00:17:09.733 --> 00:17:11.800
And I'm going to...

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:15.100
I will get you back to
your friends and family.

00:17:15.100 --> 00:17:17.400
And like you said,
I'm going to make sure

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:19.433
no one gets
left behind!

00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:26.466
I apologize for what I
did to your brother,

00:17:26.466 --> 00:17:30.033
and I know just being sorry
about it doesn't bring him back.

00:17:30.033 --> 00:17:34.200
If my apology isn't enough, you
can do whatever you want to me.

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:36.733
The only thing I ask is that
you give me enough time

00:17:36.733 --> 00:17:38.566
to keep my
promise to Yuya.

00:17:38.566 --> 00:17:40.266
Promise?

00:17:40.266 --> 00:17:42.966
I promised Yuya that
I'd protect Zuzu,

00:17:42.966 --> 00:17:46.733
and that's one
promise that I want to keep.

00:17:46.733 --> 00:17:48.733
You gotta at least
give me that.

00:17:51.733 --> 00:17:54.600
Zuzu, you know yourself that
you can't be running around

00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:56.700
with Security
on every corner.

00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.333
Since you can't get to Yuya,
I'll bring Yuya to you,

00:18:01.333 --> 00:18:03.733
it's the only option.

00:18:03.733 --> 00:18:06.666
And then Moon Shadow,
I'm all yours.

00:18:06.666 --> 00:18:08.433
Do whatever
you like.

00:18:08.433 --> 00:18:10.100
I'm at
your mercy.

00:18:13.733 --> 00:18:15.733
Agreed.

00:18:15.733 --> 00:18:18.500
Until then, I will keep Zuzu
and the children safe.

00:18:18.500 --> 00:18:20.666
I know of a secret
place in the underground

00:18:20.666 --> 00:18:23.933
hidden from prying eyes
of Sector Securty.

00:18:23.933 --> 00:18:25.566
The underground's
bad news!

00:18:25.566 --> 00:18:27.500
Are they gonna make us
work hard all the time

00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.133
if we go down
there with you?

00:18:29.133 --> 00:18:30.766
Why can't we
stay here?

00:18:30.766 --> 00:18:33.900
It may be hard for you to
believe because you are children

00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:35.600
with teeny‐weeny thoughts,

00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:37.100
but the Underground
is much safer

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:38.766
than the streets
of this city

00:18:38.766 --> 00:18:42.733
with hundreds of Sector
Security forces around.

00:18:42.733 --> 00:18:45.866
They've even taken control
of the High Council.

00:18:45.866 --> 00:18:48.133
When there is nowhere
safe above ground,

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:51.466
even the mighty
grizzly hides below.

00:18:51.466 --> 00:18:52.900
Worry not.

00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:55.033
I promise you
will be safe there.

00:18:55.033 --> 00:18:57.633
We will have the help of
the Lancers underground

00:18:57.633 --> 00:18:59.600
to assure it.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.133
Alright.

00:19:01.133 --> 00:19:04.133
At least I know we
have friends down there.

00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:06.266
(Sora)
And up here.

00:19:06.266 --> 00:19:08.933
I told you I'd bring Yuya
to you and I will.

00:19:08.933 --> 00:19:11.166
And I'll make sure both
of you and all your friends

00:19:11.166 --> 00:19:12.633
can go home together.

00:19:12.633 --> 00:19:13.633
Right.

00:19:13.633 --> 00:19:14.633
I trust you.

00:19:14.633 --> 00:19:16.300
Because you're a
great friend, Sora.

00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:19.800
And what's more,
you're my teacher.

00:19:19.800 --> 00:19:23.400
If you can't trust your
teacher, who can you trust?

00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:26.366
Zuzu...

00:19:26.366 --> 00:19:28.500
Your form's
totally terrible!

00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.800
It's elbows in
like this!

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:34.433
It still show's that there is a
lot you have to learn from me,

00:19:34.433 --> 00:19:35.633
a lot!

00:19:35.633 --> 00:19:37.133
(giggling)

00:19:43.333 --> 00:19:46.533
Well, I sure do hope y'all
are ready for the next dustup!

00:19:46.533 --> 00:19:49.966
Battling for a spot in
the semifinals is...

00:19:49.966 --> 00:19:52.866
<i>Yugo and Celina!</i>

00:19:55.766 --> 00:19:59.033
(Jean Michel Roget)
Sergey and Yuya are
very important to me.

00:19:59.033 --> 00:20:01.866
But so is Celina.

00:20:01.866 --> 00:20:06.000
For the City to be all mine,
these three are instrumental

00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.700
in my plans for
a total checkmate.
