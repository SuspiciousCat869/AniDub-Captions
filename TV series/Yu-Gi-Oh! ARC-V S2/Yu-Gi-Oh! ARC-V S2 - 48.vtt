WEBVTT

00:00:01.166 --> 00:00:04.100
(Yuya)
Previously on Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V...

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:06.566
(Roget)
Attention all Sector
Security units...

00:00:06.566 --> 00:00:09.466
enter the Duel Palace
and arrest Yuya, Jack

00:00:09.466 --> 00:00:11.333
and the rest of
the traitors.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.333
(Declan)
Enough tiptoeing around
it's time to end this

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:15.800
once and for all!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:17.300
Ragnarok attack!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.800
Show them who reigns supreme!

00:00:22.933 --> 00:00:25.333
(Roget)
Who do these Lancers
think they are!

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.233
They're interference
is going to ruin everything!

00:00:28.233 --> 00:00:30.400
(Yuya)
<i>It's showtime, Jack!</i>

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.166
A friend told me to dueltain
myway into the hearts of
everyone

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:35.766
in this city and that's
what I'm gonna do!

00:00:35.766 --> 00:00:37.533
We'll see about that.

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:38.766
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:38.766 --> 00:00:40.366
(Sora)
We're in.

00:00:40.366 --> 00:00:41.633
Saving Zuzu will be easier

00:00:41.633 --> 00:00:44.433
than taking candy
from a baby...

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.200
(Roget)
This has been fun.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.666
But this is the end...
for both of you.

00:00:49.666 --> 00:00:52.466
There's something blocking
the road ahead‐‐ Ah!

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:54.366
<i>It's Sector Security!</i>

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:57.700
But no one's gonna put
the brakes on Jack!

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.666
(Roget) Attention:
Sector Security...

00:00:59.666 --> 00:01:02.433
run Jack and Yuya off
the road!

00:01:02.433 --> 00:01:06.100
I activate Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's special ability!

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.666
It destroys all monsters...

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:11.300
including yours, Yuya!

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:14.233
Feel the heat!

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:16.766
(surprised gasp)

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.933

(Melissa)
<i>Whoo‐eeee!</i>

00:02:26.733 --> 00:02:29.966
Jack just jackhammered all of
Sector Security with one
blast

00:02:29.966 --> 00:02:32.566
from his Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:34.933
And now, Yuya's
in the line of fire!

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:37.566
(Jack) I'll admit it's
certainly been real, Yuya...

00:02:37.566 --> 00:02:40.133
really disappointing that is!

00:02:40.133 --> 00:02:42.300
(Melissa) Jack Atlas
just mish‐mashed

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.266
all o' security's
monsters,

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:47.666
meanin' Yuya's days of
duelin' are done for!

00:02:47.666 --> 00:02:48.733
That's it!?

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:49.733
Yuya lost
the duel?

00:02:49.733 --> 00:02:50.866
That can't be!

00:02:50.866 --> 00:02:53.166
Let's wait til
the smoke clears.

00:02:55.866 --> 00:02:59.000
I use this action spell to zip
past your flames, Jack,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.500
so I'm still in the game.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.933
(Melissa)
With quick thinkin'
and shrewd duelin'

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.433
Yuya pulled the fat
out o' the fire!

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:05.633
Yay!
Yay!

00:03:05.633 --> 00:03:06.700
Yuya made it!

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.833
Ah...

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:09.633
He had me
worried there.

00:03:09.633 --> 00:03:12.333
Yuya's not out
of the woods yet.

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:15.033
(Jack)
You may have survived,
but your defense didn't.

00:03:17.533 --> 00:03:20.833
Scarlight Red Archfiend...
turn up the heat!

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:23.800
Scorch Yuya
with Molten Crimson Flare!

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.266
(Melissa)
Jack's pourin'
on the punishment!

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:33.433
(grunting)

00:03:33.433 --> 00:03:36.300
I'm activating
the action spell Double Draw!

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.033
When I take 2000
or more points of damage,

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:42.533
I get to draw two cards!

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:44.500
But it's two cards, too late!

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.166
There's no amount of cards
that can save you now,

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:48.966
but don't let that stop you!

00:03:48.966 --> 00:03:52.666
I end my turn;
take your best shot!

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:54.700
Jack's still the top dog
here folks

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.100
and that's
why he's ourhero!

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.000
The hero for all
of New Domino City!

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.966
Jack will pay!

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:03.166
(Roget)
What is it?!

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.333
Director, we have
a situation!

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:06.633
<i>Two unknown individuals</i>

00:04:06.633 --> 00:04:08.000
have infiltrated
our headquarters

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.700
andappear to be heading
towards Zuzu's cell!

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.900
They're taking down
all our guards!

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:14.866
Then send more!

00:04:14.866 --> 00:04:17.000
Stop slacking, Moon Shadow.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.133
I'm taking down
my fifth guard already!

00:04:19.133 --> 00:04:21.500
For your information, Sora,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.033
I have already taken down
my sixteenth.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.633
(grunting)

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.066
There's still
a whole horde of 'em.

00:04:36.066 --> 00:04:37.366
This may take a while.

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:39.600
Time that we do not have.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.100
Roget has brainwashed all of
Security to serve him,

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.366
but maybe we can use
that to our advantage.

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:48.333
How are we gonna do that?

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:50.333
If they're all under
mind control,

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:51.700
perhaps we can turn them

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.600
all off at once if we can find
the master switch.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.400
(Melissa)
Yuya's blasted past
some of Jack's

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.000
most blisterin'
attacks...

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.400
but does this youngin'
have anything left

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.700
<i>in the tank?!</i>

00:05:05.766 --> 00:05:08.500
(Yuya)
I've been dueltaining my whole
life to bring smiles

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.500
to the crowd,
just like dad did.

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.633
Why not dueltain like only you
can instead of copying your dad.

00:05:15.633 --> 00:05:17.833
Be you, Yuya!

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:19.466
(Yuya)
But is it true that
I haven't actually

00:05:19.466 --> 00:05:21.200
learned anything
from my dad?

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.866
That I'm just copying him?

00:05:22.866 --> 00:05:26.200
That I've never actually
dueled on my own?

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.600
Hurry up and make your move.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.966
I mean your dad's move.

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:34.766
Unless of course you have
the guts to be your own man!

00:05:34.766 --> 00:05:37.800
But that's
a long shot at best.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.633
Jack...
I'm gonna beat you my way!

00:05:40.633 --> 00:05:42.933
(Yuya)
I'll show him that I haven't
copied my dad;

00:05:42.933 --> 00:05:44.400
I learned from him.

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.500
And I'll use those dueltaining
skills to show Jack

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:50.900
that I can win and bring
the crowd to their feet.

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.366
Watch your back, Jack!

00:05:57.866 --> 00:05:59.233
Here goes...

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:01.766
I Pendulum
Summon!

00:06:01.766 --> 00:06:04.733
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:06:04.733 --> 00:06:08.700
It's go time,
Timebreaker Magician!

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:13.700
Giddyup and go...
Performapal Radish Horse!

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.200
And here's a monster that
oughta jog your memories, Jack!

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:17.633
It's Tuning Magician!

00:06:17.633 --> 00:06:20.566
(Tuning Magician laughing)

00:06:20.566 --> 00:06:22.500
That's the card I gave him!

00:06:24.533 --> 00:06:27.966
When I summon Tuning Magician,
you regain 400 life points

00:06:27.966 --> 00:06:30.366
while I take 400
points of damage.

00:06:30.366 --> 00:06:31.566
(grunts)

00:06:35.066 --> 00:06:36.666
I know I know it sounds
crazy to give you

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:38.866
your life points back,
but by doing so,

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:41.500
I get to summon
Performapal Life Swordsman.

00:06:48.466 --> 00:06:50.800
And since you got 400 life
points back,

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.766
I'm breathing some life
into my swordsman's

00:06:52.766 --> 00:06:55.733
attack points.

00:06:55.733 --> 00:06:58.366
You know why your dragon
is always so angry?

00:06:58.366 --> 00:07:00.233
Because it's probably
not eating right.

00:07:00.233 --> 00:07:02.300
So here's a radish to chew on.

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.466
But being healthy
has its downside.

00:07:04.466 --> 00:07:07.966
It's less angry, so it has 500
fewer attack points..

00:07:07.966 --> 00:07:10.666
Which transfer
over to my swordsman.

00:07:10.666 --> 00:07:12.366
Jack, you think
that I haven't

00:07:12.366 --> 00:07:14.833
improved my game at all,
but I have.

00:07:14.833 --> 00:07:18.333
You didn't see these new
and improved moves coming.

00:07:18.333 --> 00:07:21.033
Like Sam giving me his
Tuning Magician,

00:07:21.033 --> 00:07:22.600
making my deck stronger.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.266
Okay, prove it to me.

00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:26.166
Let's see if all this talk
carries any weight

00:07:26.166 --> 00:07:29.333
and can actually fuel you past
the Master of Faster!

00:07:29.333 --> 00:07:31.866
You'll be in my rearview
mirror in no time

00:07:31.866 --> 00:07:35.533
because I'm taking this duel
to a whole new level!

00:07:35.533 --> 00:07:39.833
Tuning Magician tunes Radish
Horse and Timebreaker Magician!

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:48.300
I Synchro Summon!

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.600
Welcome to the battlefield,
Enlightenment Paladin!

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.666
(Yuya)
Welcome to the battlefield,
Enlightenment Paladin!

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:06.066
I can't believe Yuya
was able to use

00:08:06.066 --> 00:08:07.533
my little Tuning Magician

00:08:07.533 --> 00:08:09.433
to summon such
a powerful monster.

00:08:09.433 --> 00:08:13.500
Enlightenment Paladin, enlighten
Jack on what you can do!

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:16.533
He lets me take Smile World
back from my graveyard!

00:08:19.933 --> 00:08:22.233
Smile World was the key
to my dad's dueltaining,

00:08:22.233 --> 00:08:24.166
and it's the key
to my dueltaining too.

00:08:24.166 --> 00:08:26.700
And when the time's right,
it'll be the key...

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:28.033
to your defeat.

00:08:28.033 --> 00:08:29.266
(Jack scoffs)

00:08:29.266 --> 00:08:32.400
I tribute Performapal
Life Swordsman,

00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:36.000
to raise Elemental Paladin's
attack points by 900!

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:41.466
Making Elemental Paladin
stronger than your dragon!

00:08:41.466 --> 00:08:42.866
All right then...

00:08:42.866 --> 00:08:44.433
Enlightenment Paladin,

00:08:44.433 --> 00:08:46.933
bring the house down
on Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:08:46.933 --> 00:08:48.200
(Enlightenment Paladin shrieks)

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:51.666
I play the trap Red Crystal
which prevents my dragon

00:08:51.666 --> 00:08:57.066
from being destroyed by your
predictably pathetic play!

00:08:57.066 --> 00:08:59.666
(Melissa)
Jack's life points
are gonna take a tumble

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:03.166
but his dragon is still
alive an' kickin'!

00:09:03.166 --> 00:09:04.966
And Yuya's,
prob'ly kickin' himself

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:06.866
for not pullin' off
that attack.

00:09:06.866 --> 00:09:09.566
Oh man...
I guess I have to end my turn.

00:09:09.566 --> 00:09:11.666
And now that my turn's over,

00:09:11.666 --> 00:09:13.466
your Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend

00:09:13.466 --> 00:09:16.200
regains its attack points
while Enlightenment Paladin

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.733
loses his attack points.

00:09:21.233 --> 00:09:24.666
(Sylvio)
It's like Yuya needs training
wheels or something.

00:09:24.666 --> 00:09:27.500
Yuya is pulling out
all the stops in this battle,

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:29.766
but Jack's not slowing down
for a second,

00:09:29.766 --> 00:09:30.866
he's just blasting
right through

00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:32.133
like they're not even there.

00:09:32.133 --> 00:09:35.400
Gong hopes Yuya's
got somethin' up his sleeve.

00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:38.900
(Yuya)
My dad's dueltaining made
him a champion,

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:41.333
but my dueltaining's
just made me a chump.

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:44.500
Yuya, your dueltaining
is nothing...

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:46.066
but a joke.

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:48.733
A cheap rip‐off
of your dad's style.

00:09:48.733 --> 00:09:51.000
Void of anything original.

00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.400
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend
use your special ability

00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:57.633
to wipe out Yuya's
Enlightenment Paladin!

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:03.433
I activate Performapal
Bubblebowwow's Pendulum
ability!

00:10:03.433 --> 00:10:07.433
This pooch destroys itself
to stop your special ability!

00:10:12.066 --> 00:10:14.000
That won't save you!

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:17.066
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend
bring the heat!

00:10:17.066 --> 00:10:19.633
Roast his Enlightenment
Paladin with...

00:10:19.633 --> 00:10:22.966
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:10:22.966 --> 00:10:24.300
Nice try.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.033
My other Pendulum monster
uses its special ability!

00:10:27.033 --> 00:10:29.900
Go, Performapal Gumgumouton!

00:10:29.900 --> 00:10:33.166
It pulls the wool over your
attack and stops it!

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:35.633
But you still take
damage, Yuya!

00:10:35.633 --> 00:10:38.600
Life points that you can
ill afford to lose!

00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.566
(Melissa)
Yuya's life points
are runnin' on fumes!

00:10:41.566 --> 00:10:45.600
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:48.833
Using the abilities of your
Pendulum Monsters like that...

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:51.833
was the most original thing
you've done all duel.

00:10:57.133 --> 00:10:59.400
(guards groaning)

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.033
(groaning)

00:11:04.033 --> 00:11:06.766
(Moon Shadow)
Control room secure.

00:11:06.766 --> 00:11:08.533
Hey check it out!

00:11:08.533 --> 00:11:11.400
That's the mind
control system!

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:14.933
And I have just
the card to blow it up.

00:11:14.933 --> 00:11:18.400
(distant explosion)

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.066
What was that blast?

00:11:20.066 --> 00:11:23.133
Seems like there's a whole lot
going on outside of this cell.

00:11:23.133 --> 00:11:24.766
I hope everyone's okay.

00:11:24.766 --> 00:11:26.666
(Roget)
What's taking so long?

00:11:26.666 --> 00:11:28.166
I ordered all Security forces

00:11:28.166 --> 00:11:30.600
to apprehend the intruders
by any means necessary.

00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:31.900
<i>I don't know.</i>

00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.500
They were all heading
towards the control

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:36.600
center to apprehend them, but
they've suddenly stopped

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.800
<i>following orders.</i>

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.633
How absurd.

00:11:39.633 --> 00:11:43.100
That must mean my mind control
system is now...

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.566
offline!

00:11:49.333 --> 00:11:51.266
(beeping)

00:11:53.933 --> 00:11:55.366
What am I doing here?

00:11:55.366 --> 00:11:58.466
And what...
are they all doing here?

00:11:58.466 --> 00:12:00.733
We aren't trick or treating!

00:12:00.733 --> 00:12:02.033
(Melissa)
<i>Wowza!</i>

00:12:02.033 --> 00:12:05.000
Looks like Jack and Yuya
aren't the only ones

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.100
<i>tussling in town today!</i>

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.533
(screaming)

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:14.266
This is one rumble
that's as feisty

00:12:14.266 --> 00:12:16.933
<i>as a hogtiedhedgehog.</i>

00:12:16.933 --> 00:12:20.533
Shay, Sylvio, and Gong,
please come with me.

00:12:20.533 --> 00:12:23.400
Let's bring peace
back to the streets.

00:12:23.400 --> 00:12:25.300
Does that mean you're gonna
take down the Commons?

00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.900
That's horrible!

00:12:26.900 --> 00:12:28.700
And a whole
lot o' mean.

00:12:28.700 --> 00:12:30.533
Trust me, when they
get a sight of Sylvio

00:12:30.533 --> 00:12:32.666
the superstar,
they'll drop their Duel Disks

00:12:32.666 --> 00:12:34.933
and snap a selfie
with me.

00:12:34.933 --> 00:12:36.533
Don't worry about
a thing, y'all.

00:12:36.533 --> 00:12:38.200
Gong's on it.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:42.133
We're not here to hurt
anybody, we're here to help.

00:12:42.133 --> 00:12:45.566
And that's exactly what
we're all gonna do, I promise.

00:12:45.566 --> 00:12:47.633
Just be sure
to have some snacks

00:12:47.633 --> 00:12:49.333
ready for me
when I get back.

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:51.966
And Terron, please don't
eat all the donuts.

00:12:51.966 --> 00:12:54.200
Saving this city is hungry work.

00:13:03.733 --> 00:13:06.300
(Yuya)
Jack actually gave me
a compliment.

00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:10.000
Using the abilities of your
Pendulum Monsters like that...

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.266
was the most original thing
you've done all duel.

00:13:13.266 --> 00:13:16.166
The most original
thing I did all duel...

00:13:16.166 --> 00:13:19.533
Someone's gotta step up
and do something new.

00:13:19.533 --> 00:13:21.833
You opened the door
to Pendulum Summoning!

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:23.200
Oh, yeah!

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:24.933
I was the first ever
to Pendulum Summon

00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:26.566
and that was pretty
original too.

00:13:28.033 --> 00:13:30.933
I mean, I've dueltained
all my life,

00:13:30.933 --> 00:13:34.533
but Pendulum Summoning
is something unique to me.

00:13:34.533 --> 00:13:36.666
So when Jack said that I
haven't been really
dueltaining

00:13:36.666 --> 00:13:39.033
in my own unique style,
he was right.

00:13:39.033 --> 00:13:41.600
Because my own unique style
isn't just dueltaining,

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:44.633
it's swinging things my way like
no one has ever done before!

00:13:44.633 --> 00:13:48.966
It's time to show you
how I, and only I, can duel!

00:13:48.966 --> 00:13:51.566
You had better
not disappoint me, Yuya.

00:13:51.566 --> 00:13:53.600
Now get on with it already!

00:13:55.600 --> 00:14:00.300
It's my turn... my way!

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:04.033
I'm setting the Pendulum Scale
with Performapal Gumgumouton

00:14:04.033 --> 00:14:06.266
and Xiangke Magician!

00:14:06.266 --> 00:14:09.000
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:14:15.366 --> 00:14:18.700
I can summon as many Level 2
monsters as I want.

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:20.700
Swing far Pendulum!

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:24.666
Carve the arc of victory!

00:14:24.666 --> 00:14:28.233
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:14:28.233 --> 00:14:31.333
Let's hear it
for Performapal Cheermole!

00:14:31.333 --> 00:14:32.866
And here's something...

00:14:32.866 --> 00:14:34.700
all new!

00:14:34.700 --> 00:14:37.733
And now Level 8 Enlightenment
Paladin tunes my Level 2

00:14:37.733 --> 00:14:40.233
Performapal Cheermole!

00:14:40.233 --> 00:14:41.800
Have you lost your mind?

00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.366
Enlightenment Paladin
isn't a Tuner Monster.

00:14:44.366 --> 00:14:46.466
(Yuya)
That's where you're wrong!

00:14:46.466 --> 00:14:48.166
There's a monster
I can Synchro Summon

00:14:48.166 --> 00:14:50.333
only after I Pendulum Summon!

00:14:50.333 --> 00:14:53.066
This is something unique
that only I can do!

00:14:53.066 --> 00:14:54.466
Unbelievable!

00:15:05.866 --> 00:15:08.233
Now I Synchro Summon!

00:15:08.233 --> 00:15:11.333
Nirvana High Paladin!

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:12.466
(grunts)

00:15:16.033 --> 00:15:17.266
(gasps)

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:19.166
(Melissa)
<i>Well, dunk my bucket!</i>

00:15:19.166 --> 00:15:22.266
Somehow, someway, Yuya Sakaki
has showed us

00:15:22.266 --> 00:15:25.000
something no onehas
ever laid eyes on!

00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:27.866
Ah, so you're finally
dueling your way.

00:15:27.866 --> 00:15:29.433
It's about time you showed up.

00:15:29.433 --> 00:15:33.800
Nirvana High Paladin...
attack Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:44.900
Elysium Elimination!

00:15:51.166 --> 00:15:53.833
Well done,
but not too well done.

00:15:53.833 --> 00:15:57.300
Your attack activated
my trap King Scarlet.

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.500
Not only does it protect
my dragon from destruction,

00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:04.166
but King Scarlet also transforms
into a Tuner Monster!

00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:08.166
What do you have planned, Jack?

00:16:08.166 --> 00:16:09.300
(Frankie)
This duel's amazing!

00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:11.166
(Terron)
Jack and Yuya are awesome!

00:16:11.166 --> 00:16:12.766
(Amanda)
Neither one
of them's backing down!

00:16:12.766 --> 00:16:15.533
The only way this could be
better is if I were dueling.

00:16:15.533 --> 00:16:17.633
This is the finest final ever.

00:16:17.633 --> 00:16:19.433
(man)
Yuya rules!
(man 2) Yeah, get 'im, Jack!

00:16:19.433 --> 00:16:22.266
So you've finally found
your voice, Yuya.

00:16:22.266 --> 00:16:23.800
Too bad you found it too late.

00:16:29.833 --> 00:16:31.200
It's over!

00:16:31.200 --> 00:16:32.400
Now!

00:16:32.400 --> 00:16:37.766
I summon the tuner monster
Mirror Resonator!

00:16:37.766 --> 00:16:39.700
He has two tuner monsters?

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:41.533
Wonder what Jack's
plannin'?

00:16:41.533 --> 00:16:43.166
(gasps)

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:44.633
And I wonderif it
involves anything

00:16:44.633 --> 00:16:46.600
<i>to avoid thatdeep drop!</i>

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.733
Look out!

00:17:05.633 --> 00:17:08.666
I blaze my own trail...
in life and in dueling!

00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:12.133
Now my King Scarlet and my
Mirror Resonator both tune

00:17:12.133 --> 00:17:14.800
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:16.333
Woah, both of 'em?

00:17:16.333 --> 00:17:17.600
(all)
No way!

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.433
(Jack Atlas)
Together these monsters

00:17:19.433 --> 00:17:21.666
will call forth
an absolute power

00:17:21.666 --> 00:17:24.100
destined to rule
this duel!

00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.900
Now I Synchro Summon!

00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:32.633
Bow down and tremble in terror

00:17:32.633 --> 00:17:36.566
before Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:17:36.566 --> 00:17:37.633
(roaring)

00:17:43.633 --> 00:17:45.566
(Jack Atlas)
Bow down and tremble in terror

00:17:45.566 --> 00:17:48.500
before Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:17:53.633 --> 00:17:57.333
(Melissa)
Yee hah, Jack's newest
dragon is scarier

00:17:57.333 --> 00:18:00.900
than a scarecrow
and hotter than a habanero!

00:18:03.033 --> 00:18:05.700
I can hardly believe
what I'm seeing!

00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:09.933
Just when Yuya steps up his
game, Jack steps his up too!

00:18:12.066 --> 00:18:13.300
Yuya and Jack
are certainly

00:18:13.300 --> 00:18:16.033
bringing out the best
in one another.

00:18:16.033 --> 00:18:18.133
A champion might rest
on his laurels

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:19.633
when he reaches
the top.

00:18:19.633 --> 00:18:22.433
But a true champion never
stops honing his skills,

00:18:22.433 --> 00:18:25.633
because for a true champion,
there isn't a top.

00:18:29.133 --> 00:18:33.300
Now, my tyrant's special
ability activates!

00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.266
It destroys all your cards!

00:18:35.266 --> 00:18:37.233
Including your Pendulum Cards!

00:18:37.233 --> 00:18:39.900
Absolute Power Inferno!

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.400
<i>Oh, my!</i>

00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:48.133
That sure was a
clean sweep!

00:18:48.133 --> 00:18:49.900
But my field won't
stay empty for long

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:53.233
thanks toHighPaladin's
special ability!

00:18:53.233 --> 00:18:55.333
When Nirvana High Paladin
is destroyed,

00:18:55.333 --> 00:18:58.533
it reappears
in my Pendulum Zone!

00:18:58.533 --> 00:19:01.366
That won't help you!

00:19:01.366 --> 00:19:04.300
Tyrant Red Dragon Archfiend,
attack Yuya directly

00:19:04.300 --> 00:19:05.933
and end this duel!

00:19:05.933 --> 00:19:07.966
Molten Crimson Tide!

00:19:10.033 --> 00:19:12.566
I'm activating
the action spell Evasion,

00:19:12.566 --> 00:19:13.966
so I can evade your attack!

00:19:13.966 --> 00:19:15.833
It won't work, Yuya.

00:19:15.833 --> 00:19:17.666
You see, you're not allowed
to play spells

00:19:17.666 --> 00:19:20.600
when Tyrant Red Dragon
Archfiend is attacking!

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:22.400
And your little
misdemeanor

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:25.433
increases my dragon's
attack points by 500,

00:19:25.433 --> 00:19:26.400
not that I needed it.

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.466
There's no way you can
out clever me!

00:19:29.466 --> 00:19:31.766
Because, by stopping
my spell,

00:19:31.766 --> 00:19:33.733
I get to summon
Acrobatic Magician

00:19:33.733 --> 00:19:38.433
from my hand in defense mode
to protect my life points!

00:19:38.433 --> 00:19:40.933
Then you leave me no choice
by to have my tyrant

00:19:40.933 --> 00:19:43.100
make your
magician disappear!

00:19:49.033 --> 00:19:50.833
(Yuya)
When my magician
is destroyed,

00:19:50.833 --> 00:19:52.933
it goes to my
Pendulum Zone too,

00:19:52.933 --> 00:19:55.666
so now my Pendulum Scale
is once again set!

00:19:55.666 --> 00:19:56.833
Heh.

00:19:56.833 --> 00:19:58.866
So you bought
yourself another turn.

00:19:58.866 --> 00:20:02.400
But all you're doing
is delaying the inevitable.

00:20:02.400 --> 00:20:03.666
You think you
have the upper hand,

00:20:03.666 --> 00:20:05.400
but the way
I'm dueling now,

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:07.500
I don't think anyone
can beat me.

00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.600
I'm actually glad
to hear you say that.

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:12.133
At first you just followed
in your father's footsteps.

00:20:12.133 --> 00:20:13.800
But now, you're creating
your own path.

00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.833
Create my own path?

00:20:15.833 --> 00:20:19.100
Your father dueltained
the only way he knew how

00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:22.733
and now you've started to duel
the only way you know how.

00:20:22.733 --> 00:20:24.633
You're taking dueltaining

00:20:24.633 --> 00:20:28.300
and Pendulum Summoning,
the very best of both worlds

00:20:28.300 --> 00:20:31.200
and combining
the two of them into one.

00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:33.266
(Yuya thinking)
So that's what Jack meant.

00:20:33.266 --> 00:20:36.133
That I was only copying
what my dad was doing,

00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:39.266
not really learning and weaving
it into my own style.

00:20:39.266 --> 00:20:41.733
And that's what I should have
been doing with everyone

00:20:41.733 --> 00:20:43.000
I ever dueled.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.700
Learning from them to create
my own style of dueling.

00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.733
That's just what
I'm gonna do...

00:20:48.733 --> 00:20:51.633
to win this duel...

00:20:53.266 --> 00:20:56.700
They've all helped me to
become the duelist that I am.

00:20:56.700 --> 00:20:59.800
And I know they're out there
right now doing everything

00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.233
they can to save this city.

00:21:04.233 --> 00:21:07.200
To restore peace and bring calm
to all the chaos.

00:21:09.433 --> 00:21:11.500
To help those in need

00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:13.566
and bring friends back
together again...

00:21:19.266 --> 00:21:22.500
To right the wrongs
no matter the odds.

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:26.600
And with all of their help,
I'm going to defeat you!

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:29.833
Since I already built
my Pendulum Scale...

00:21:29.833 --> 00:21:32.633
My Scale 2
Acrobatic Magician

00:21:32.633 --> 00:21:36.900
and Scale 8 Nirvana High Paladin
are set in my Pendulum Zone!

00:21:36.900 --> 00:21:40.633
And now I can summon monsters
between Level 3 and Level 7

00:21:40.633 --> 00:21:42.866
all at the same time!

00:21:42.866 --> 00:21:44.700
Swing far pendulum!

00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:47.333
Carve the arc of victory!

00:21:47.333 --> 00:21:49.733
My monsters are ready...

00:21:49.733 --> 00:21:52.066
to swing into action!

00:22:13.033 --> 00:22:14.966
Wow, that's quite the crew.

00:22:14.966 --> 00:22:16.500
<i>Whoo‐ee.</i>

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:17.633
Well done, Yuya!

00:22:17.633 --> 00:22:19.166
Awright!
Hurray!
Yuya!
Awesome!

00:22:19.166 --> 00:22:22.066
(shocked gasping)

00:22:25.100 --> 00:22:26.666
Get ready!

00:22:26.666 --> 00:22:28.533
Because I've saved
the best for last!
