00:10:04.599 --> 00:10:06.766
You can Pendulum Summon, too?

Abyss Stage Treasure Boat

00:10:34.699 --> 00:10:37.299
During our own turns, we each
put a monster on the boat to

00:10:37.299 --> 00:10:39.166
keep it safe because
all our other monsters

Oh.

00:11:29.029 --> 00:11:30.995
The exhaust fan wasn't
working so we thought

00:11:30.995 --> 00:11:32.795
we'd fix it on our own.

00:11:32.795 --> 00:11:35.229
He's a real
exhaust fan fan.

00:11:35.229 --> 00:11:36.795
Okay.

00:11:36.795 --> 00:11:38.195

00:11:38.195 --> 00:11:39.662
The duel's
already started.

00:11:39.662 --> 00:11:41.562
Right...

00:11:47.129 --> 00:11:48.995
It's my move!

00:11:48.995 --> 00:11:51.362
I...

00:11:51.362 --> 00:11:52.629

Win this!

00:11:59.495 --> 00:12:02.495
Let me see what this
Action Duel is all about.

00:12:02.495 --> 00:12:04.029
I activate...

00:12:04.029 --> 00:12:07.062
Sound Rebound!

00:12:08.229 --> 00:12:09.362
(scared moan)

00:12:09.362 --> 00:12:11.595
This will silence
any chance you have

00:12:11.595 --> 00:12:14.229
of preventing me
from activating a spell.

00:12:14.229 --> 00:12:16.862
I'm liking these Action Cards.

00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:18.095
Now what should I do next

00:12:18.095 --> 00:12:20.629
to really get
this crowd into this duel?

00:12:22.662 --> 00:12:25.262
I activate Super Koi Koi!

00:12:25.262 --> 00:12:28.829
I draw three cards from my deck,
and if any of them

00:12:28.829 --> 00:12:31.895
are Flower Cardians,
I can summon them!

00:12:31.895 --> 00:12:34.095
But if you draw don't
draw a Flower Cardian,

00:12:34.095 --> 00:12:35.929
it goes straight
to the graveyard,

00:12:35.929 --> 00:12:40.295
and you take a thousand points
of damage for every single one.

00:12:40.295 --> 00:12:43.862
You only go around once, friend,
and I'm going 'round in style!

00:12:43.862 --> 00:12:45.829
Time to draw!

00:12:45.829 --> 00:12:49.295
(men chanting)
Draw, draw, draw, draw, draw!

00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:51.595
Here's card number one!

00:12:51.595 --> 00:12:55.162
Flower Cardian Clover with Boar!

00:12:55.162 --> 00:12:56.929
One for one.

00:12:56.929 --> 00:12:59.695
Let's see number two!

00:12:59.695 --> 00:13:02.595
Flower Cardian Maple With Deer!

00:13:02.595 --> 00:13:04.495
He got another Flower Cardian?

00:13:04.495 --> 00:13:05.695
Of course he did.

00:13:05.695 --> 00:13:06.695
He's our hero!

00:13:06.695 --> 00:13:08.362
The final card.

00:13:08.362 --> 00:13:10.062
This could make
it three for three.

00:13:10.062 --> 00:13:11.195
Yes!

00:13:11.195 --> 00:13:14.462
Flower Cardian Peony
With Butterfly!

00:13:14.462 --> 00:13:17.695
Due to Super Koi Koi's effect,
these three lose all their

00:13:17.695 --> 00:13:20.395
attack points,
and their Levels drop to 2.

00:13:22.729 --> 00:13:24.962
Flower Cardian Peony
With Butterfly

00:13:24.962 --> 00:13:26.562
tunes Clover
with Boar

00:13:26.562 --> 00:13:28.529
and Maple with Deer!

00:13:28.529 --> 00:13:29.995
Behold my friends...

00:13:29.995 --> 00:13:32.162
As the majestic beauty
of the butterfly

00:13:32.162 --> 00:13:33.895
tunes itself to the valor

00:13:33.895 --> 00:13:37.595
and swiftness of the deer
and to the bravery of the boar,

00:13:37.595 --> 00:13:40.995
I Synchro Summon!

00:13:40.995 --> 00:13:44.595
Come forth,
Flower Cardian Boardefly!

00:13:48.495 --> 00:13:52.095
Now go take root on the Treasure
Boat Of The Lucky Seven.

00:13:55.562 --> 00:13:57.795
(man 2)
Hey!
(man)
All right!

00:13:57.795 --> 00:13:59.629
You're going to have to do
better than that

00:13:59.629 --> 00:14:00.729
to take me down.

00:14:00.729 --> 00:14:02.762
You haven't seen anything yet,

00:14:02.762 --> 00:14:05.195

my best for later.

00:14:05.195 --> 00:14:08.295
Now then, take center
stage Yuya...

00:14:08.295 --> 00:14:09.329
(surprised grunts)

00:14:09.329 --> 00:14:11.962

Come on! Let's see some action!

00:14:11.962 --> 00:14:14.162

What's his problem?
(man 3)
What's with that kid?

00:14:14.162 --> 00:14:16.195
(Chojiro)
Yuya!
Uh, oh, right.

00:14:16.195 --> 00:14:17.662
I draw.

00:14:17.662 --> 00:14:20.029
I summon Performapal Hip Hippo.

00:14:20.029 --> 00:14:21.862
(grunts)

00:14:21.862 --> 00:14:24.962
(man)
That Hippo has more pop
in its step than that kid!

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:26.929
(Yuya)
Wonder when they're going
to make their move.

00:14:26.929 --> 00:14:28.929
Are you ready to roll?

00:14:32.029 --> 00:14:34.929
(Yuya)
While I'm here dueling,
Zuzu might be in real trouble.

00:14:36.262 --> 00:14:38.329
I'm only in here cause
of you and your pals!

00:14:40.429 --> 00:14:41.495
Oh.

00:14:41.495 --> 00:14:43.429
Huh?

00:14:43.429 --> 00:14:45.729
(man)
Come on, show us
what that Hippo can do!

00:14:48.395 --> 00:14:49.395
And now...

00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:51.329
I guess I'll end my turn.

00:14:51.329 --> 00:14:52.662
(man)
Why don't he duel?

00:14:52.662 --> 00:14:54.162
(man 2)
Come on, let's see some action!

00:14:54.162 --> 00:14:55.662
(Chojiro)
What are you doing, Yuya?

00:14:55.662 --> 00:14:58.662
I thought you said dueling was
all about making people smile?

00:14:58.662 --> 00:15:00.429
(Sylvio)
The only thing you're making
people do right now

00:15:00.429 --> 00:15:02.329
is fall asleep.

00:15:02.329 --> 00:15:04.195
Uh‐oh...

00:15:04.195 --> 00:15:05.862
He's losing their attention.

00:15:05.862 --> 00:15:07.462
(Gong)
Losing whose attention?

00:15:09.895 --> 00:15:12.295
Seems like you two
are up to something...

00:15:12.295 --> 00:15:13.862
something no good!

00:15:13.862 --> 00:15:16.862
♪

00:15:18.162 --> 00:15:20.662
If you're getting
stage fright, Yuya...

00:15:20.662 --> 00:15:23.729
Then I guess it's up to me
to whip up the crowd!

00:15:23.729 --> 00:15:27.295
I activate Treasure Boat Of The
Lucky Seven's effect,

00:15:27.295 --> 00:15:30.062
which lets me draw an extra card
for every monster

00:15:30.062 --> 00:15:32.229
I have on the boat.

00:15:32.229 --> 00:15:34.195
That means I draw two cards!

00:15:34.195 --> 00:15:35.262
Ha!

00:15:35.262 --> 00:15:36.262
Ha!

00:15:36.262 --> 00:15:37.495
You may have
gotten two cards

00:15:37.495 --> 00:15:39.162
but that's
two cards too late.

00:15:39.162 --> 00:15:40.595
Oh, yeah?

00:15:40.595 --> 00:15:44.095
Well, then maybe a third
will do the trick, old timer!

00:15:44.095 --> 00:15:45.795
You draw two cards,

00:15:45.795 --> 00:15:48.295
but you want an Action Card
on top o' that!?

00:15:48.295 --> 00:15:50.329
You're a greedy one, kid.

00:15:50.329 --> 00:15:51.729
Winners don't wait,

00:15:51.729 --> 00:15:54.729
we go out and grab victory,
right, Yuya?

00:15:54.729 --> 00:15:56.495
(Gong)
Snap out of it Yuya!

00:15:56.495 --> 00:15:59.295
Gong knows you better than you
know yourself.

00:15:59.295 --> 00:16:02.195
Gong can tell when you're
worried, and Gong bets you're

00:16:02.195 --> 00:16:04.595
worried about Zuzu.

00:16:04.595 --> 00:16:06.195
Of course I am Gong!

00:16:06.195 --> 00:16:08.029
Listen, Gong's worried too.

00:16:08.029 --> 00:16:09.462
But Gong's got a plan.

00:16:09.462 --> 00:16:11.529
Not just Gong though.

00:16:11.529 --> 00:16:13.929
We got a plan.

00:16:13.929 --> 00:16:15.395
Hi!

00:16:15.395 --> 00:16:16.729
Whoosh!

00:16:16.729 --> 00:16:19.029
(Gong)
Do what you gotta do!

00:16:19.029 --> 00:16:21.629
And we'll do what we gotta do.

00:16:26.862 --> 00:16:27.895
Yeah!

00:16:29.429 --> 00:16:30.895
And now it's...

00:16:30.895 --> 00:16:32.529
Showtime!

00:16:32.529 --> 00:16:33.995
(crowd cheering)

00:16:33.995 --> 00:16:37.762
Sounds like Yuya
is ready to join the fun.

00:16:37.762 --> 00:16:40.595
I activate Hippo Carnival!

00:16:41.729 --> 00:16:42.795
(indistinct shouting)

00:16:45.562 --> 00:16:47.029
(unintelligible chanting)

00:16:47.029 --> 00:16:49.662
Huh?!
It's a... stampede!

00:16:49.662 --> 00:16:51.729
(screaming)

00:16:51.729 --> 00:16:54.762
Hi‐ho, hippo!

00:16:54.762 --> 00:16:55.695
(Yuya shouts)

00:16:55.695 --> 00:16:57.029
I want in
on this action!

00:17:03.329 --> 00:17:07.262
(all yelling)

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:10.395
(Yuya laughing)

00:17:10.395 --> 00:17:13.795
(Sylvio screaming)

00:17:13.795 --> 00:17:15.795
(groaning)

00:17:15.795 --> 00:17:18.695
(surprised gasp)
What're you doing?

00:17:18.695 --> 00:17:19.995
Wow, you okay kid?

00:17:19.995 --> 00:17:21.295
That was some move.

00:17:21.295 --> 00:17:23.629
Hey, what's going on here?

00:17:23.629 --> 00:17:24.595
(gasps)

00:17:28.462 --> 00:17:29.462
(gasps)

00:17:29.462 --> 00:17:32.229
Oh, no!

00:17:32.229 --> 00:17:34.629
Where did he go?

00:17:34.629 --> 00:17:36.729
(grunts)

00:17:38.295 --> 00:17:39.295
Stop!

00:17:39.295 --> 00:17:40.529
(rapid thuds)

00:17:40.529 --> 00:17:42.629
(men groaning)

00:17:47.162 --> 00:17:48.862
(Gong groaning)

00:17:48.862 --> 00:17:50.962
You been walking around
on your hands?

00:17:50.962 --> 00:17:52.062
Why're you here?

00:17:52.062 --> 00:17:54.829
Gong came to rescue you.

00:17:54.829 --> 00:17:56.495
Like I need help.

00:17:56.495 --> 00:17:57.562
(growls)

00:17:57.562 --> 00:17:59.329
Fools.

00:17:59.329 --> 00:18:00.862
Hey!
Wait up!

00:18:01.862 --> 00:18:04.762
♪

00:18:06.629 --> 00:18:09.429

Who's there?

00:18:10.862 --> 00:18:12.295
Dennis?

00:18:12.295 --> 00:18:13.795
Your knight in...

00:18:13.795 --> 00:18:16.595
no armor is here
to rescue you, princess.

00:18:16.595 --> 00:18:19.529
Take my hand

Stop the duel!

00:18:22.995 --> 00:18:24.195
Nobody move!

That's bad news for you.

00:18:54.817 --> 00:18:55.917
Very bad!

You don't have to knock
everyone out, you know.

00:19:27.917 --> 00:19:29.450
Don't move a muscle!

Hey, what's with the pit stop?

00:19:51.984 --> 00:19:54.484
A real duelist doesn't
leave his duel disk behind.

00:19:56.550 --> 00:19:58.517
Come on.

00:19:58.517 --> 00:20:00.650
Hey, wait!

00:20:02.050 --> 00:20:05.250
Chojiro...

00:20:05.250 --> 00:20:09.117
This duel was just
a distraction for a jailbreak?

00:20:09.117 --> 00:20:10.317
What're you
trying to say?

00:20:11.784 --> 00:20:13.984
Sorry, Chojiro.

00:20:13.984 --> 00:20:16.184
But I have to
save my friend Zuzu.

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:19.450
(indistinct shouting)

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:23.150
(Yuya)
Listen, my friends
out there all alone

00:20:23.150 --> 00:20:24.884
and Security's
trying to get her.

00:20:24.884 --> 00:20:26.984
I can't let that happen.

00:20:26.984 --> 00:20:30.917
Chojiro, I have to find her.

00:20:30.917 --> 00:20:32.484
Then go.

00:20:32.484 --> 00:20:33.884

00:20:36.450 --> 00:20:37.884
Chojiro!

00:20:37.884 --> 00:20:39.350
I'll hold 'em back...

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:40.650
You get out of here!

00:20:42.484 --> 00:20:43.817
Good luck, kid.

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.984
Thanks for watching the show!

00:20:54.984 --> 00:20:57.017
And as a token
of our gratitude,

00:20:57.017 --> 00:21:00.517

You get goin' while we got the
guards distracted and help Yuya!

00:21:19.784 --> 00:21:21.317
We can take care of ourselves.

00:21:21.317 --> 00:21:22.784
Thank you...

00:21:23.917 --> 00:21:25.617
(man)
We got plenty more!

00:21:25.617 --> 00:21:27.917
You get a card,
and you get a card!

00:21:27.917 --> 00:21:30.117
Everybody gets a card!

00:21:30.117 --> 00:21:32.384
I'll never forget
what you've done for me.

00:21:32.384 --> 00:21:33.450
Never.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:35.184
Let's go, Yuya.

00:21:35.184 --> 00:21:36.250
Huh?

00:21:36.250 --> 00:21:37.850
Yeah.

00:21:37.850 --> 00:21:39.550
It's time, Sylvio!

00:21:39.550 --> 00:21:41.517
And leave these rares behind?

This show's a wrap!

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.917
We've all had a blast performing
for you, but now it's time for

00:21:56.917 --> 00:21:58.850
us to take a bow.
