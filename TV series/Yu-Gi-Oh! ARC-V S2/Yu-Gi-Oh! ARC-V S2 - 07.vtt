00:00:00.645 --> 00:00:03.945
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:06.045
This is Melissa Trail here,

00:00:06.045 --> 00:00:08.111
reporting live from
the Tops TV Sky Eye.

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:10.078
The battle between
Sector Security

00:00:10.078 --> 00:00:12.045
and one of Commons
boldest outlaws

00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:13.811
is kicking into high gear!

00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:17.578
I Synchro Summon
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon!

00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.378
Reverse Revenge!

00:00:24.011 --> 00:00:25.711
No! What can I do?

00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.611
Now, Clear Wing, attack!

00:00:27.611 --> 00:00:30.111
Spin Storm Sky Strike!

00:00:34.945 --> 00:00:36.911
(Melissa Trail)
This is incredible!

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.545
Sector Security
just got served!

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:42.145
(Jean Michel Roget)
You two may think
you've escaped...

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.978
but my eyes are everywhere.

00:00:50.745 --> 00:00:52.878
(Yuya)
Let's get moving and find Zuzu!

00:00:52.878 --> 00:00:55.645
(siren wailing)

00:00:55.645 --> 00:00:57.711
(security officer)
Your little game is over.

00:00:57.711 --> 00:01:00.645
You should've known
you couldn't elude us forever.

00:01:00.645 --> 00:01:02.411
Yeah, it's them all right.

00:01:02.411 --> 00:01:05.611
They're dressed different,
but the faces match the photos.

00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:06.945
There's two others with 'em.

00:01:06.945 --> 00:01:08.245
(Jean Michel Roget)
Bring them in right away.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:13.945
We've been lookin' all over
for you lousy punks

00:01:13.945 --> 00:01:15.411
since last night!

00:01:15.411 --> 00:01:16.645
Don't give us any trouble!

00:01:16.645 --> 00:01:19.311
Last night?
But we just got here.

00:01:19.311 --> 00:01:21.045
(grunts)

00:01:21.045 --> 00:01:22.878
Sylvio,
this isn't a good idea.

00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.611
No, Celina,
not you, too!

00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:30.345
(all)

(alarm blaring)

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:35.878
(female operator)
There's a malfunction in
the duel control mainframe.

00:02:35.878 --> 00:02:38.778
(male operator)
Reroute command data
to Alpha Channel stat.

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:42.178
Transferring data stream
from Delta to Alpha now.

00:02:42.178 --> 00:02:43.645
It's not working.

00:02:43.645 --> 00:02:45.945
The system could be
under a cyberattack.

00:02:45.945 --> 00:02:47.745
(female operator #2)
Where's the problem
coming from?

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:49.211
(female operator #3)
District D‐8.

00:02:49.211 --> 00:02:50.478
(male operator #2)
Isn't that the location

00:02:50.478 --> 00:02:53.578
we rerouted
Sector Security to?

00:02:53.578 --> 00:02:55.611
(Jean Michel Roget)
Give me a visual.

00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:58.311
(female operator)
I wish I could, sir, but our
systems are going haywire.

00:02:58.311 --> 00:03:00.445
We're running
an analysis and...

00:03:00.445 --> 00:03:02.611
Oh, sir,
the anomaly is stemming

00:03:02.611 --> 00:03:04.711
from an unknown
duel card interface.

00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:15.711
(screaming)

00:03:15.711 --> 00:03:18.611
Oh, no!
Sylvio, you okay?

00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:20.045
(grunts)

00:03:20.045 --> 00:03:23.578
It was over...
before it even started.

00:03:23.578 --> 00:03:25.978
You, 'cuff that punk!

00:03:27.978 --> 00:03:30.445
(snarling)

00:03:30.445 --> 00:03:32.145
Hey, watch it, guy!

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:34.011
You might want to
rethink this...

00:03:34.011 --> 00:03:36.978
or my dad'll have your badge
when he becomes mayor.

00:03:36.978 --> 00:03:40.011
I don't think these guys know
how to act any other way.

00:03:40.011 --> 00:03:42.045
Oh, we can play nice.

00:03:42.045 --> 00:03:44.478
As long as you Commons
don't resist arrest

00:03:44.478 --> 00:03:46.011
and come along
peacefully.

00:03:46.011 --> 00:03:48.311
Sorry, but I don't
do "peaceful."

00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:49.678
Celina!

00:03:49.678 --> 00:03:52.011
These guys
got me runnin' on red!

00:03:52.011 --> 00:03:55.711
Now, which one of you
wants to fall first?

00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:57.511
Hey!
This isn't helping...

00:03:59.811 --> 00:04:02.545
Please...
where's my big brother?

00:04:02.545 --> 00:04:04.145
Do you know?

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:06.611
I don't.

00:04:06.611 --> 00:04:09.111
But it'll be okay,
Riley.

00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:11.145
I'll take care of you
till we find him.

00:04:11.145 --> 00:04:12.945
That's a promise.

00:04:12.945 --> 00:04:14.945
You, arrest
the small fry.

00:04:14.945 --> 00:04:16.478
Yes, sir.

00:04:18.445 --> 00:04:20.111
Stay behind me.

00:04:20.111 --> 00:04:23.778
I wouldn't resist if I were you,
it'll only make things worse.

00:04:23.778 --> 00:04:25.378
Take it easy!

00:04:25.378 --> 00:04:26.878
Let's talk this out first.

00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:28.978
We don't wanna make
any trouble.

00:04:28.978 --> 00:04:30.411
You already have.

00:04:30.411 --> 00:04:32.345
We're taking the whole lot
of you Commons in

00:04:32.345 --> 00:04:34.711
for trespassing
into Tops Villa Area.

00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:37.278
Come on! Seriously?

00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:38.645
But we just got here!

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.045
Then we'll give
you newcomers

00:04:40.045 --> 00:04:42.178
a free tour of
the detention center.

00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:43.978
You're gonna love
The Facility.

00:04:43.978 --> 00:04:46.645
(grunts)
I guess I have no choice.

00:04:46.645 --> 00:04:48.678
(both)
Let's duel!

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:51.211
This way!

00:04:54.911 --> 00:04:56.945
If you're thinking of
making a run for it,

00:04:56.945 --> 00:04:58.545
better think again.

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:00.478
(groans)

00:05:13.077 --> 00:05:14.710
If you're thinking of
making a run for it,

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.310
better think again!

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.243
(groans)

00:05:20.043 --> 00:05:22.277
Yuya, you can
make a difference.

00:05:22.277 --> 00:05:24.443
Show everyone what
dueling's really about.

00:05:24.443 --> 00:05:27.677
And just like your dad,
do it with a smile.

00:05:27.677 --> 00:05:29.577
(Yuya thinking)
You got it, Mom.

00:05:29.577 --> 00:05:32.610
I've only got one chance
to make a first impression

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.910
so I better put
my best duel forward.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:37.743
Which means I have to handle
this the way Dad would have

00:05:37.743 --> 00:05:40.843
and let the Dueltainer in me
take center stage!

00:05:40.843 --> 00:05:43.110
I'll show these coppers
that I'm not here to harm them

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.443
but to entertain them
and make them smile.

00:05:45.443 --> 00:05:48.310
Hello, Officers!

00:05:49.743 --> 00:05:52.243
May I have your
attention please?

00:05:52.243 --> 00:05:55.210
You are all about to witness
a dueling extravaganza

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:57.377
the likes of which
you've never seen before!

00:05:57.377 --> 00:06:00.910
My name's Yuya Sakaki
and my dad was a trailblazer!

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.210
He pioneered an awesome
form of dueling

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:04.810
that he called
Dueltainment!

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:07.177
And now I'm gonna give you
a demonstration!

00:06:07.177 --> 00:06:08.743
Cool, right?

00:06:08.743 --> 00:06:11.110
This better be
a performance for the ages

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:13.043
or it'll be curtains
for all of us!

00:06:13.043 --> 00:06:14.843
Let's get this show
on the road!

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:18.010
First,
I'd like you to meet

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.943
one of my most popular
Perfomapals, Hip Hippo!

00:06:24.343 --> 00:06:26.543
Whoa‐ah!

00:06:26.543 --> 00:06:29.143
It'll be okay, Riley.
Trust me.

00:06:30.777 --> 00:06:32.677
Get hoppin', Hippo.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:37.443
Pardon my Hip Hippo,
but it's hopping with excitement

00:06:37.443 --> 00:06:39.177
'cause this is
its first‐ever performance

00:06:39.177 --> 00:06:41.910
in another dimension.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:44.210
(female operator)
We've restored visuals
in District D‐8.

00:06:47.843 --> 00:06:49.610
This hippo hops,

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:52.110
but I got other hippos
that like to dance.

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:55.377
So get set to get
your groove on!

00:06:55.377 --> 00:06:59.310
I activate the dancetastic
spell card Hippo Carnival!

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:02.977
Okay, ladies!

00:07:02.977 --> 00:07:04.243
Now hit it!

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:07.910
Uh...

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.843
(Yuya)
These samba loving ladies
are here to protect me,

00:07:11.843 --> 00:07:15.810
so don't even think of trying
to dance around their defenses.

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.710
As long as the music
keeps playing,

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:19.143
they'll never skip a beat.

00:07:24.543 --> 00:07:26.043
(thinking)
So weird...

00:07:29.777 --> 00:07:32.310
Aren't those the happiest
Hippos you ever saw?

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:34.977
And there's a lot more fun
and surprises coming up.

00:07:34.977 --> 00:07:37.243
We do hope you enjoyed
our first turn.

00:07:37.243 --> 00:07:40.243
Yeah, whatever.

00:07:40.243 --> 00:07:44.443
I got some fun surprises planned
for you twerps, too.

00:07:44.443 --> 00:07:47.443
Starting with Vigilante Zeni!

00:07:47.443 --> 00:07:49.043
When Zeni's on the job,

00:07:49.043 --> 00:07:50.710
he likes workin'
with a partner.

00:07:50.710 --> 00:07:53.710
By dropping Zeni's
attack points to zero,

00:07:53.710 --> 00:07:55.343
his special ability

00:07:55.343 --> 00:07:58.177
lets me bring a second
Vigilante into this brawl.

00:07:58.177 --> 00:08:02.243
And that'll be the Tuner Monster
Vigilante Gata!

00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:06.510
A Tuner Monster?

00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:08.343
Then I know what's next.

00:08:08.343 --> 00:08:10.143
If you're thinkin'
I'm gonna tune

00:08:10.143 --> 00:08:12.510
Vigilante Gata
with Vigilante Zeni,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:14.677
then you're spot on!
Move it, you two!

00:08:21.577 --> 00:08:24.377
We'll break this
delinquent down so much,

00:08:24.377 --> 00:08:28.177
no one'll ever
put 'em back together.

00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:29.910
I Synchro Summon...

00:08:29.910 --> 00:08:31.910
My ultimate enforcer,

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:33.943
Marksman Heiji Type 0!

00:08:35.577 --> 00:08:38.277
Great, not what
I was aiming for.

00:08:38.277 --> 00:08:40.410
Thanks to Marksman's
special ability,

00:08:40.410 --> 00:08:42.243
by sending a card
to the graveyard,

00:08:42.243 --> 00:08:45.910
my Marksman can take aim and
give Hip Hippo the heave‐ho!

00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:47.643
But that's not all...

00:08:47.643 --> 00:08:50.443
400 of your life points
are getting tossed as well!

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.310
This Action Spell will give me
plenty of protection!

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:01.843
Guard Cover's
letting this pretty lady

00:09:01.843 --> 00:09:03.110
cut in and take the hit!

00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:09.610
Well, buddy, you're still
gonna take damage.

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:13.210
And my Marksman can keep
doling out punishment

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.277
'cause it can use its ability
over and over again.

00:09:16.277 --> 00:09:19.443
So your Hip Hippo's
still a goner.

00:09:19.443 --> 00:09:20.843
Think again.

00:09:20.843 --> 00:09:23.943
Thanks to Guard Cover,
my pink pachyderms protected.

00:09:32.443 --> 00:09:34.310
You all right, Riley?

00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:36.843
Hang on tight,
Hippo's 'bout to bounce.

00:09:38.677 --> 00:09:42.110
The last few moves
got my Hip Hippo so jumpy,

00:09:42.110 --> 00:09:44.910
its turned into
a regular "hoppapotumus"!

00:09:44.910 --> 00:09:46.977
I think you need to
ground your game,

00:09:46.977 --> 00:09:49.777
and make sure that hopper
takes down that copper!

00:09:51.943 --> 00:09:53.643
Time to join the fun.

00:09:53.643 --> 00:09:56.810
I summon Lunalight Blue Cat!

00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:58.843
Whatever you thugs
try throwing at me,

00:09:58.843 --> 00:10:00.410
I can handle.

00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:05.910
So go ahead...
and take your best shot.

00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:08.177
Marksman Heiji,
show this Common

00:10:08.177 --> 00:10:10.377
what happens
when you break the law.

00:10:21.777 --> 00:10:23.810
You still have
one Hippo left.

00:10:23.810 --> 00:10:26.010
That stinks... for you!

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:29.243
Because I have one card left
in my hand to take it out!

00:10:29.243 --> 00:10:31.010
This is just terrific.

00:10:31.010 --> 00:10:33.243
Now Yuya's gonna lose
his last Hippo!

00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:35.810
If you were dueling
more than dancing,

00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:37.910
maybe you wouldn't have
gotten into this mess!

00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:40.010
Let this be a lesson.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:43.210
Never mess with
Sector Security.

00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:46.077
Marksman Heiji,
you may blast away!

00:10:58.285 --> 00:11:01.052
Ha‐ha.
One delinquent down.

00:11:01.052 --> 00:11:04.052
(Yuya)
Sorry, but your Marksman
missed its mark.

00:11:04.052 --> 00:11:06.418
No! It can't be!

00:11:12.218 --> 00:11:15.218
Mirror Barrier...
where'd that come from?

00:11:15.218 --> 00:11:18.718
(Yuya)
I saw the card just in time
and snagged it.

00:11:18.718 --> 00:11:20.652
It's an Action Spell.

00:11:20.652 --> 00:11:23.485
My Mirror Barrier absorbed
your monster's blast

00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:25.818
and protected both
Hip Hippo and me!

00:11:25.818 --> 00:11:27.852
What exactly are
these Action Spells

00:11:27.852 --> 00:11:29.585
your buddy keeps
babbling on about?

00:11:29.585 --> 00:11:32.185
First of all,
that twerp isn't my buddy.

00:11:32.185 --> 00:11:34.785
Secondly,
Action Spells are cards.

00:11:34.785 --> 00:11:36.285
They're spread
around the field.

00:11:36.285 --> 00:11:38.852
If you pick them up,
they can give you an advantage.

00:11:38.852 --> 00:11:40.618
Action cards?

00:11:40.618 --> 00:11:43.952
What an interesting
development.

00:11:46.418 --> 00:11:48.418
I gotta find me one...

00:11:52.318 --> 00:11:54.618
Now I can get
a piece of the action.

00:11:56.085 --> 00:11:58.618
I'm activating
the Action Spell

00:11:58.618 --> 00:12:00.352
Zero Penalty!

00:12:00.352 --> 00:12:03.885
It wipes out all your little
pink pal's attack points.

00:12:07.952 --> 00:12:09.485
Hip Hippo!

00:12:09.485 --> 00:12:12.185
Marksman Heiji, attack!

00:12:12.185 --> 00:12:14.418
(both screaming)

00:12:33.325 --> 00:12:36.092
I knew we could never count on
your pathetic skills

00:12:36.092 --> 00:12:37.492
to get us out of this mess!

00:12:37.492 --> 00:12:39.792
Why don't you at least
learn something from me

00:12:39.792 --> 00:12:41.292
if you're gonna get beat?!

00:12:41.292 --> 00:12:43.492
I flamed out fast,
but with style!

00:12:43.492 --> 00:12:45.392
Your turn,
security man.

00:12:45.392 --> 00:12:47.392
Go ahead and show me
what you're made of.

00:12:47.392 --> 00:12:49.058
Don't mind if I do.

00:12:55.958 --> 00:12:58.992
I tune Level 3
Vigilante Gata

00:12:58.992 --> 00:13:02.625
with Level 4
Vigilante Zeni!

00:13:02.625 --> 00:13:04.325
I Synchro Summon...

00:13:04.325 --> 00:13:07.158
Marksman Heiji Type 0!

00:13:10.025 --> 00:13:13.858
I had a funny feeling
I would be seeing him again.

00:13:13.858 --> 00:13:15.392
I'll give you this much‐‐

00:13:15.392 --> 00:13:17.725
you guys aren't
terribly original,

00:13:17.725 --> 00:13:19.492
but you're consistent.

00:13:19.492 --> 00:13:22.358
Riley, don't worry
about a thing.

00:13:22.358 --> 00:13:23.958
We're gonna be fine.

00:13:23.958 --> 00:13:25.658
(security officer)
Don't lie to the kid!

00:13:25.658 --> 00:13:27.958
If you keep resisting,
you'll just make it worse!

00:13:27.958 --> 00:13:30.125
This will be
your last chance.

00:13:30.125 --> 00:13:31.592
Surrender while you can

00:13:31.592 --> 00:13:33.758
and maybe we won't throw
the whole book at you.

00:13:33.758 --> 00:13:36.758
Sorry, but that isn't
part of the plan.

00:13:36.758 --> 00:13:38.925
Surrendering is for wimps.

00:13:38.925 --> 00:13:41.825
I'll fight back
with a spell card.

00:13:41.825 --> 00:13:44.125
I activate Polymerization!

00:13:44.125 --> 00:13:46.692
I fuse Lunalight Blue Cat

00:13:46.692 --> 00:13:48.925
with Lunalight
Purple Butterfly!

00:13:48.925 --> 00:13:51.625
By combining the reflexes
of a fierce feline

00:13:51.625 --> 00:13:54.325
with the fluttering fury
of a nighttime huntress,

00:13:54.325 --> 00:13:56.658
I can create
a new lunar legend!

00:13:58.925 --> 00:14:01.158
I Fusion Summon

00:14:01.158 --> 00:14:03.325
the Fusion Monster

00:14:03.325 --> 00:14:05.225
Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:14:05.225 --> 00:14:07.192
What's a Fusion Monster?

00:14:07.192 --> 00:14:10.125
Fusion, interesting.

00:14:10.125 --> 00:14:13.792
Send additional security
units to Sector D‐8.

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:16.792
Do not let these individuals
escape at any cost.

00:14:16.792 --> 00:14:20.292
I activate the spell
Lunalight Perfume.

00:14:20.292 --> 00:14:22.192
It's truly a refreshing scent.

00:14:22.192 --> 00:14:23.958
So refreshing, in fact,
that I can bring back

00:14:23.958 --> 00:14:25.892
Lunalight Blue Cat
from the graveyard

00:14:25.892 --> 00:14:27.858
to scratch my way
to freedom!

00:14:27.858 --> 00:14:30.758
Resurrecting my feline friend
gives me an extra advantage,

00:14:30.758 --> 00:14:32.725
because it now doubles
the attack points

00:14:32.725 --> 00:14:34.325
of Lunalight Cat Dancer!

00:14:37.225 --> 00:14:38.725
It's time to pounce.

00:14:38.725 --> 00:14:40.692
I activate
Cat Dancer's ability!

00:14:40.692 --> 00:14:43.958
By tributing
Lunalight Blue Cat...

00:14:43.958 --> 00:14:47.692
my Cat Dancer can attack
your monster twice!

00:14:47.692 --> 00:14:50.392
Messing with us
was a huge mistake,

00:14:50.392 --> 00:14:53.558
but you'll see that for yourself
when Lunalight Cat Dancer

00:14:53.558 --> 00:14:55.392
takes aim at your Marksman!

00:14:55.392 --> 00:14:57.325
Full Moon Mayhem!

00:15:03.992 --> 00:15:05.925
(yelling)

00:15:07.225 --> 00:15:08.558
No way!

00:15:08.558 --> 00:15:10.392
We're getting skunked
by these Commons!

00:15:10.392 --> 00:15:12.625
But all we have to do
is wait for backup

00:15:12.625 --> 00:15:14.658
and then we'll
surround and impound!

00:15:14.658 --> 00:15:16.758
You may think we came
to make trouble,

00:15:16.758 --> 00:15:18.725
but really we just
came to make friends.

00:15:18.725 --> 00:15:20.192
Yuya...

00:15:20.192 --> 00:15:21.792
Yeah, what is it?

00:15:27.358 --> 00:15:29.525
We're here
to make friends,

00:15:29.525 --> 00:15:31.892
but I don't think
we need this many.

00:15:31.892 --> 00:15:33.925
Call in all the troops you want.

00:15:33.925 --> 00:15:36.658
It just means more for me
to take down!

00:15:38.425 --> 00:15:40.258
(whimpering)

00:15:42.092 --> 00:15:44.592
It's too bad they got
so lucky against me.

00:15:44.592 --> 00:15:46.025
If I was still in this duel,

00:15:46.025 --> 00:15:48.125
I'd make these mall cops
beg for mercy!

00:15:48.125 --> 00:15:50.358
I'd take 'em
all out by myself!

00:15:50.358 --> 00:15:53.692
Look, you yourselves should know
when you're defeated.

00:15:53.692 --> 00:15:56.925
So be smart about this
and make the right decision.

00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:59.358
Just put your Duel Disks down.

00:15:59.358 --> 00:16:01.758
(Yuya thinking)
There's too many of them.

00:16:01.758 --> 00:16:03.825
I don't know how
we're going to get away...

00:16:03.825 --> 00:16:05.792
Unless...

00:16:05.792 --> 00:16:08.058
It's my turn!

00:16:08.058 --> 00:16:11.758
(thinking)
Just what the doctor ordered.

00:16:11.758 --> 00:16:14.658
I'll use Scale 1
Performapal Monkeyboard

00:16:14.658 --> 00:16:16.958
and Scale 6
Performapal Guiturtle

00:16:16.958 --> 00:16:18.558
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:16:18.558 --> 00:16:21.825
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:16:35.125 --> 00:16:37.658
And now, I'm allowed
to summon monsters

00:16:37.658 --> 00:16:40.592
from Level 2 through 5
all at the same time!

00:16:40.592 --> 00:16:42.758
Yep! I would have
Pendulum Summoned, too!

00:16:42.758 --> 00:16:44.825
Wait!
We're not there yet!

00:16:44.825 --> 00:16:47.158
Before I Pendulum Summon,

00:16:47.158 --> 00:16:50.358
I'm activating Guiturtle's
Pendulum ability.

00:16:50.358 --> 00:16:52.125
It lets me draw a card.

00:16:54.125 --> 00:16:56.792
(thinking)
Setting my Pendulum Scale
was the first step,

00:16:56.792 --> 00:16:58.992
but if I don't get
the next card I need here,

00:16:58.992 --> 00:17:00.625
then it was all for nothing.

00:17:16.188 --> 00:17:18.354
(thinking)
If I don't get
the next card I need here,

00:17:18.354 --> 00:17:21.388
then it was all for nothing.

00:17:26.521 --> 00:17:30.121
Well... did I pull it off?

00:17:35.188 --> 00:17:36.654
Awesome!

00:17:36.654 --> 00:17:38.188
Hey, Monkeyboard!

00:17:38.188 --> 00:17:40.521
I think it's time
I stop monkeying around

00:17:40.521 --> 00:17:42.654
and activate
your Pendulum ability.

00:17:42.654 --> 00:17:45.254
Now I can add
a Performapal to my hand

00:17:45.254 --> 00:17:48.221
that's Level 4‐or‐below.

00:17:49.654 --> 00:17:51.121
Okay, I'm set.

00:17:51.121 --> 00:17:53.188
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:17:53.188 --> 00:17:55.621
Carve the arc of victory!

00:17:57.088 --> 00:18:01.354
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:18:03.788 --> 00:18:06.754
Let's hear it for
Performapal Cheermole!

00:18:06.754 --> 00:18:09.721
Get your beat on
Performapal Drummerilla!

00:18:09.721 --> 00:18:12.721
Toot your own horn,
Performapal Trumpanda!

00:18:12.721 --> 00:18:15.321
Not only can these three
carry a tune,

00:18:15.321 --> 00:18:18.154
but they're gonna
carry me to victory!

00:18:18.154 --> 00:18:19.621
Exactly right.

00:18:19.621 --> 00:18:22.288
They're gonna play
your swan song, creeps.

00:18:22.288 --> 00:18:24.554
(security officer)
Move in! Arrest them all!

00:18:28.721 --> 00:18:31.488
Who are these duelists?

00:18:31.488 --> 00:18:34.721
They use Action Cards
and Fusion Summon...

00:18:35.988 --> 00:18:38.488
And what is
this Pendulum thing?

00:18:38.488 --> 00:18:39.988
Clearly these are
not the Commons

00:18:39.988 --> 00:18:42.221
we were searching for
last night.

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:44.221
But if they aren't them,

00:18:44.221 --> 00:18:47.188
then who can these
individuals be?

00:18:47.188 --> 00:18:50.454
I've got these dozen,
how about you?

00:18:50.454 --> 00:18:52.821
Celina,
I'll distract these guys

00:18:52.821 --> 00:18:54.754
while you make
a break for it with Riley

00:18:54.754 --> 00:18:56.488
and get to someplace
that's safe.

00:18:56.488 --> 00:18:58.454
You want me to cut and run?

00:18:58.454 --> 00:19:01.188
Trust me, I have a plan.

00:19:01.188 --> 00:19:03.521
And it all starts
once I activate

00:19:03.521 --> 00:19:05.854
the spell
Performance Hurricane!

00:19:08.088 --> 00:19:11.621
Okay, let the jam
session begin!

00:19:12.921 --> 00:19:15.021
I hope you feel
the beat and bounce

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:17.688
because each Performapal
is gonna bounce one card

00:19:17.688 --> 00:19:19.788
on your field back
to your hand.

00:19:31.254 --> 00:19:33.221
Hey, looks like your monster

00:19:33.221 --> 00:19:35.354
wants to boogie
before it bounces!

00:19:49.404 --> 00:19:51.271
Celina, go!

00:19:51.271 --> 00:19:53.037
I'm not going anywhere!

00:19:53.037 --> 00:19:55.471
If you think I'm gonna
babysit instead of duel,

00:19:55.471 --> 00:19:57.704
then you should of
hired another nanny!

00:19:57.704 --> 00:20:00.171
Come on, Celina, please!

00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:01.404
Too late, you twerp!

00:20:01.404 --> 00:20:05.237
Marksman Heiji's
special ability activates!

00:20:05.237 --> 00:20:07.037
When this monster
leaves the field,

00:20:07.037 --> 00:20:09.137
I can bring back the monsters
that were used

00:20:09.137 --> 00:20:10.904
to summon it
from the graveyard!

00:20:13.671 --> 00:20:17.104
(Celina)
Oh, no! These monsters
are blocking our escape!

00:20:21.171 --> 00:20:22.971
Now, arrest them all!

00:20:25.104 --> 00:20:27.404
Oh, Yuya!

00:20:30.304 --> 00:20:32.704
(chuckling)

00:20:32.704 --> 00:20:34.604
(engine revving)

00:20:52.037 --> 00:20:54.571
(man)
Leave these people alone!

00:20:54.571 --> 00:20:58.037
They've done nothing to you,
but that never matters, does it?

00:20:58.037 --> 00:21:01.771
Time to teach you a lesson!
Raikiri, cut open a path!

00:21:30.204 --> 00:21:32.437
Thank you...

00:21:32.437 --> 00:21:34.537
I think.
