WEBVTT

00:00:02.433 --> 00:00:08.766
(Lucas Swank)
It's like I said, if you ride
with me, you ride in luxury.

00:00:08.766 --> 00:00:12.433
This is the place.

00:00:12.433 --> 00:00:15.200
You boys are about to
see some of the best duelists

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:17.933
New Domino City has
never heard of.

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.066
(Gong)
Gong's not interested.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.200
Finding Yuya and our friends
is more important

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.800
than finding out about
some duelists no one knows.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.433
But if this is a place
where duelists gather...

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:30.966
Then Yuya and the others
could be here scouting them.

00:00:30.966 --> 00:00:32.966
How do you figure that?

00:00:32.966 --> 00:00:34.533
Because it's our job
as Lancers

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.866
to find new allies
in this dimension.

00:00:36.866 --> 00:00:38.666
And if Lucas is
telling the truth,

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:41.400
this place could be a
duelist gold mine.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.533
We could find an
entire army here,

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.233
and since they're
the best of the best,

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:48.433
those fiends from Fusion
won't stand a chance!

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:51.400
If you buy the story this
guy's tryin' to sell us.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.366
(Lucas Swank)
What I sell is 100% pure gold!

00:00:54.366 --> 00:00:56.733
I hope you're not tryin'
to insinuate

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.766
that Lucas Swank
the premier promoter would lie!

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:03.933
I'll teach you to doubt
the Sultan of Swank.

00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:05.300
Now come on!

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.166

Maybe you'll believe
your eyes.

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:23.800

What is
this place?

00:02:30.366 --> 00:02:35.033
This is New Domino City's numero
uno underground duel arena

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:37.833
where the Commons can let loose
and enjoy a little competition

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.666
away from the pryin'
eyes of the Top's cops.

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:41.933
Don't sound legit!

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:43.766
No way we'll find
our friends here!

00:02:43.766 --> 00:02:45.133
Oh!

00:02:45.133 --> 00:02:46.933
What now?

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:49.300

I Xyz Summon!

00:02:51.533 --> 00:02:55.566
Take flight Raidraptor
Rise Falcon!

00:02:55.566 --> 00:02:57.033
(roaring)

00:03:01.966 --> 00:03:04.200
With attack points that
low you should have summoned

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.833
a chicken out instead to
match your personality!

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:11.433
(Shay)
Once Rise Falcon's special
ability activates,

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:13.866
we'll see who
tries to fly the coop.

00:03:13.866 --> 00:03:15.500
By using one
Overlay Unit,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.766
it gains your monster's
attack points!

00:03:20.366 --> 00:03:21.566
Aw, come on!

00:03:21.566 --> 00:03:22.633
Let's do this.

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.933
Raidraptor Rise Falcon,
finish him!

00:03:25.933 --> 00:03:28.066
Ravaging Rebellion!

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.766
(crowd, chanting)
Shay all the way, Shay
all the way, Shay all the way!

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.833
I'm here for the same
reason you're here,

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:48.600
to find powerful duelists.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.533
You see, Gong,
the kind of duelists

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.666
we need to find are in
underground places like this.

00:03:53.666 --> 00:03:57.466
I tell ya, these guys are rough,
tough and up to snuff.

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.700
I think you're getting
ahead of yourself.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.000
When I heard all
the best duelists

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.633
were in the underground,
I got my hopes up.

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:04.966
What a joke.

00:04:04.966 --> 00:04:07.700
All the supposed hot shots
are nothing but hot dogs.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.200
These duelists
talk a good game,

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.733
but the best of them is
barely second rate.

00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:13.533
(laughing)

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:17.000
When Shay Baby pours on that
sweet Xyz Summon sauce of his,

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.766
ain't no duelist in town
can shut him down.

00:04:19.766 --> 00:04:23.300
As an Xyz master myself, that
doesn't surprise me at all.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.233
So you got some Xyz
summonin' skills as well.

00:04:26.233 --> 00:04:29.766
I can't wait to see if the talk
can keep up with the walk.

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:31.533
Trust me, it won't.

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:34.566
The Xyz he learned at the Leo
Institute is laughable at best.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:36.333
Is that so, Shay?

00:04:36.333 --> 00:04:38.400
Then I wonder why
my Xyz monsters

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.400
are so much
stronger than yours.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.266
What did you
just say?!

00:04:42.266 --> 00:04:44.433
You can settle
this later!

00:04:44.433 --> 00:04:46.700
But right now,
you got any idea

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.533
where Yuya and
the others might be?

00:04:48.533 --> 00:04:50.333
Not a clue.

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:52.200
When I got to this dimension,
I was alone.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.466
Which was
fine by me.

00:04:54.466 --> 00:04:56.266
I don't need any
snot‐nosed brat

00:04:56.266 --> 00:04:58.700
or some wanna be
heroes getting in my way.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.466
So you haven't even
looked for 'em?!

00:05:00.466 --> 00:05:02.266
They're not
my problem.

00:05:02.266 --> 00:05:04.433
I only care about finding
strong duelists

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:07.400
because the quicker I do, the
quicker I can leave this world

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.233
to attack Fusion Dimension.

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:11.100
Yeah, but, a Lancer's
also got a responsibility

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.966
to look out for
his teammates!

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:14.600
What's a Lancer?

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.666
And this "dimensions"
mumbo‐jumbo?

00:05:17.666 --> 00:05:19.400
We came from
the Standard Dimension

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.100
to this Synchro
Dimension‐‐ ow!

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:23.533
You nearly
broke a rib!

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:24.900
So sorry, Gong.

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.366
Sometimes my elbow
has a mind of its own.

00:05:27.366 --> 00:05:29.133
Is that so?

00:05:29.133 --> 00:05:31.900
Ixnay on the imensionday
to the oreignerfay.

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.900
Hey, hold the phone.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:34.600
What's goin' on
behind that hand?

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.400
Oh, just checking
my breath.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.533
But let's get back to
the reason why we're here.

00:05:38.533 --> 00:05:40.400
You wanted us to
duel, right?

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.100
Right.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.333
See I was on the lookout
for some fresh talent

00:05:44.333 --> 00:05:46.700
to take on my
main man Shay.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.733
And that is you.

00:05:48.733 --> 00:05:51.166
You got somethin',
Dashin' Dennis!

00:05:51.166 --> 00:05:53.233
That somethin's
called star quality.

00:05:53.233 --> 00:05:55.866
Am I right or
am I right?

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:57.100
(chuckles)

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.066
That's quite a compliment
coming from you, Lucas.

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:01.566
You're not thinking
of doing this?

00:06:01.566 --> 00:06:04.300
Duh, I've got
star quality.

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:06.966
Then Gong hopes you burn
out like a supernova.

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.200
Come on, Gong, they're
dueling on motorcycles.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:10.733
That's the spice I
need to build me up

00:06:10.733 --> 00:06:14.033
from a star to
a superstar!

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.666
First things, first,
they're not motorcycles.

00:06:16.666 --> 00:06:19.033
They're Duel Runners,
got it?

00:06:19.033 --> 00:06:21.066
Ain't you never seen
a Turbo Duel before?

00:06:21.066 --> 00:06:22.566
(both)
A Turbo Duel,
what's that?

00:06:24.933 --> 00:06:27.366
A long time ago, Turbo
Duels were just the way

00:06:27.366 --> 00:06:29.033
some Commons used
to battle.

00:06:29.033 --> 00:06:30.466
Really?

00:06:30.466 --> 00:06:33.666
Crow told us it started when
a few daredevil Commons dueled

00:06:33.666 --> 00:06:36.133
while they were racing through
the highways of New Domino.

00:06:37.366 --> 00:06:40.100
They didn't even care
if they got in trouble.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.700
They just wanted to duel
harder and drive faster.

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.700
High‐speed dueling
and driving.

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:47.200
Double the action,
double the fun.

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.000
That's true, but Turbo Duels
are more than just a good time.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.566
To us they're kind
of like freedom.

00:06:52.566 --> 00:06:54.966
(Terron)
The Topsiders try
to keep us down,

00:06:54.966 --> 00:06:56.833
but when they're
riding on their Runners

00:06:56.833 --> 00:06:59.700
all their problems
go away!

00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.133
Hey, it's not
much fun over here,

00:07:02.133 --> 00:07:04.600
you and Beary wanna go
hang with the others?

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:09.266
Can we go?

00:07:09.266 --> 00:07:11.366
I didn't come all this way
for storytime, you know.

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:16.500
Anyhow, that sure rubbed
the Topsiders the wrong way.

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.400
They said Turbo Duels
were a menace

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.333
to the peace
of New Domino City,

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:23.100
so a specialized unit of Sector
Security was created

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:25.566
to go after them:
the Duel Chasers.

00:07:25.566 --> 00:07:27.100
Duel Chasers, huh?

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.966
Yeah, they're an elite
Duel Runner task force,

00:07:29.966 --> 00:07:31.333
and if you lose
to them...

00:07:31.333 --> 00:07:33.833
They throw you in
"The Facility" right away!

00:07:33.833 --> 00:07:35.600
Just for dueling?

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.800
When my father's mayor, he'll
put a stop to such nonsense.

00:07:40.166 --> 00:07:42.466
Good thing luck
was on our side.

00:07:45.066 --> 00:07:49.233
(Yuya)
If Crow didn't show up, Security
would've gotten us, too.

00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:51.633
(Crow)
They take more
than just people.

00:07:51.633 --> 00:07:52.833
(all)
Crow!

00:07:52.833 --> 00:07:54.633
Topsiders and
Sector Security

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:57.400
basically stole Turbo Dueling
from us, too.

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:58.900
You mean...

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.700
No one around here
is doing it anymore?

00:08:01.700 --> 00:08:03.133
Well, not for fun.

00:08:03.133 --> 00:08:06.400
Now we're forced into Turbo
Duels to entertain Topsiders.

00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:07.866
What do
you mean?

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:10.700
When Security chases one of
us Commons on the highway,

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.533
they transform it
into a Combat Lane

00:08:12.533 --> 00:08:15.166
and broadcast the whole
thing on live TV.

00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:16.633
It stinks.

00:08:16.633 --> 00:08:19.066
Anyway, I just took a quick
loop around the neighborhood

00:08:19.066 --> 00:08:20.600
and Security's everywhere,

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.933
so if you wanna stay off their
radar, chill here for a while.

00:08:23.933 --> 00:08:27.300
All of you.

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:29.733
So, because of a few
cops on motorbikes,

00:08:29.733 --> 00:08:32.233
you scurried back here
to hide like a rat?

00:08:32.233 --> 00:08:33.500
What'd you say?

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:34.866
Celina!

00:08:34.866 --> 00:08:37.166
And you didn't find any
news about our friends!

00:08:37.166 --> 00:08:40.700
Celina, you owe Crow an
apology, he's helping us!

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.300
Fine, but he needs to learn
how to help better!

00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.566
You know what, forget
it, I'll handle it.

00:08:45.566 --> 00:08:48.233
Wait, where
are you going?

00:08:48.233 --> 00:08:49.533
Where else?

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:51.700
To dig up some
information myself!

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:54.233
If you wanna get yourself
caught, go ahead.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:57.666
I think that's a risk
I'm willing to take, too.

00:08:57.666 --> 00:08:59.200
I need to get some
fresh air.

00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:01.900
My nose doesn't deserve
this kind of treatment.

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:03.033
I'm gonna
go find Declan.

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:04.333
The sooner I find him,

00:09:04.333 --> 00:09:06.400
the sooner I get out of
this garbage dump.
Declan?

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.266
(Yuya)
We need to stick
together, don't leave!

00:09:09.266 --> 00:09:11.633
Riley, Sylvio!

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:16.366
Just great!

00:09:16.366 --> 00:09:18.233
Now I'm worse off
than when I started.

00:09:30.289 --> 00:09:32.789
Turbo Dueling is
a snap, yep!

00:09:32.789 --> 00:09:34.089
Racing around the track,

00:09:34.089 --> 00:09:36.522
throwing caution to
the wind, taking center stage!

00:09:36.522 --> 00:09:37.689
I was made for this!

00:09:37.689 --> 00:09:39.256
Oh, how I'd love
to try it.

00:09:39.256 --> 00:09:41.956
How about you, Gong?

00:09:41.956 --> 00:09:43.822
Oh, no,
not Gong.

00:09:43.822 --> 00:09:45.822
Gong don't have
time for duels.

00:09:45.822 --> 00:09:48.089
Gong's gotta find
Yuya and the others!

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:49.622
(groaning)

00:09:49.622 --> 00:09:51.789
But what a stage.

00:09:51.789 --> 00:09:57.756
(crowd, chanting)
We want Shay, we want Shay,
we want Shay, we want Shay...

00:09:57.756 --> 00:10:00.422
That crowd sure gets an
entertainer's blood pumping.

00:10:00.422 --> 00:10:02.789
Makes me want to change
those cheers for Shay

00:10:02.789 --> 00:10:04.322
into cheers for Dennis.

00:10:04.322 --> 00:10:05.556
(laughing)

00:10:05.556 --> 00:10:07.189
My instincts
were right.

00:10:07.189 --> 00:10:09.789
Dashin' Dennis
is gonna be a hit!

00:10:09.789 --> 00:10:12.622
(whimpering)

00:10:12.622 --> 00:10:14.422
So, let's
get it on!

00:10:14.422 --> 00:10:17.456
A Turbo Duel between Shay Baby
and Dashin' Dennis!

00:10:18.922 --> 00:10:22.222
Shay, we both know we need
Yuya to take down Fusion,

00:10:22.222 --> 00:10:26.422
so let's stop this Turbo Duelin'
nonsense and go find him.

00:10:26.422 --> 00:10:29.156
There's more to this duel
than you realize, Gong.

00:10:29.156 --> 00:10:31.089
There's bigger
things at stake.

00:10:31.089 --> 00:10:32.989
It's a feeder to get into
the Friendship Cup.

00:10:32.989 --> 00:10:34.622
What's this
Friendship Cup?

00:10:34.622 --> 00:10:38.722
(Lucas Swank)
It's New Domino City's
biggest duel tournament.

00:10:38.722 --> 00:10:42.256
As a kind of symbol of harmony
between Topsiders and Commons,

00:10:42.256 --> 00:10:45.722
the best duelists get together
for this festival once a year.

00:10:45.722 --> 00:10:48.789
And the winner... ha!

00:10:48.789 --> 00:10:51.656
The winner gets to battle
Mr. Jack Atlas,

00:10:51.656 --> 00:10:54.922
the Master
of Faster himself.

00:10:54.922 --> 00:10:56.822
The Master of Faster?

00:10:56.822 --> 00:10:59.122
Sounds like he knows how to
put the petal to the metal.

00:10:59.122 --> 00:11:02.322
Jack Atlas is New Domino
City's‐‐ no, make that

00:11:02.322 --> 00:11:06.622
the world's greatest, strongest,
most powerful duel champion!

00:11:06.622 --> 00:11:08.289
Then I have to
duel down here, Gong.

00:11:08.289 --> 00:11:09.656
And why's that?

00:11:09.656 --> 00:11:11.989
Because if the greatest duelists
are in the Friendship Cup,

00:11:11.989 --> 00:11:13.889
I gotta qualify
for that tournament.

00:11:13.889 --> 00:11:16.189
That's the best way to
meet the best duelists

00:11:16.189 --> 00:11:17.356
this dimension
has to offer

00:11:17.356 --> 00:11:19.522
and get them to
join our Lancers team!

00:11:19.522 --> 00:11:23.689
And they'll definitely want to
join us once I beat Jack Atlas.

00:11:23.689 --> 00:11:27.789
Only you won't battle
Jack Atlas, I will.

00:11:27.789 --> 00:11:29.356
Maybe so.

00:11:29.356 --> 00:11:31.922
But only if you
can defeat me first.

00:11:34.322 --> 00:11:35.722
Gong gives up.

00:11:39.022 --> 00:11:40.389
(to himself)
Gong's finally
hit bottom.

00:11:40.389 --> 00:11:41.856
Hey, now!

00:11:41.856 --> 00:11:44.856
This is the Sultan of Swank
asking you to make some noise

00:11:44.856 --> 00:11:48.056
for my rockin' rings, thrillin'
threads and because

00:11:48.056 --> 00:11:50.322
we're about to
get the gettin' on!

00:11:50.322 --> 00:11:53.389
It's time to
Turbo Duel!

00:11:53.389 --> 00:11:55.722
Just one more victory
makes it ten in a row

00:11:55.722 --> 00:11:58.222
for Superstar Shay, which
gives him a guaranteed

00:11:58.222 --> 00:11:59.989
go at the Friendship Cup!

00:11:59.989 --> 00:12:03.589
But now, there's a red‐headed
stranger standin' in Shay's way.

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:06.756
The bright, blazin' new
starshootin' into the
stadium

00:12:06.756 --> 00:12:09.622
is my latest and
greatestduelin' discovery!

00:12:09.622 --> 00:12:12.622
Make some noise for thelean,
mean duelin' machine,

00:12:12.622 --> 00:12:15.422
<i>Dashin' DennisMcField!</i>

00:12:15.422 --> 00:12:17.656
And now, give it
up for the undefeated

00:12:17.656 --> 00:12:21.389
underground
champion, Sweet Baby Shay!

00:12:21.389 --> 00:12:25.489
We got some new rulesjust
for this match.

00:12:25.489 --> 00:12:29.522
Dashin' Dennis starts
with4000 life points like
normal,

00:12:29.522 --> 00:12:33.989
NNbut nine‐time winner Shay, he
gets just a thousand!

00:12:41.089 --> 00:12:43.156
Listen up, some of
you might be thinkin',

00:12:43.156 --> 00:12:46.089
this challenge is just too
tough for Shay to overcome,

00:12:46.089 --> 00:12:49.456
but isn't overcoming challenges
what a champion's got to do

00:12:49.456 --> 00:12:50.856
to become a champion?

00:12:50.856 --> 00:12:54.222
Now, let's get the
action in traction!

00:13:10.037 --> 00:13:12.371
I'm so diggin'
Dashin' Dennis!

00:13:12.371 --> 00:13:14.571
My gut's got Shay
goin' all the way!

00:13:17.737 --> 00:13:20.237
Hope there are no hard
feelings after I win.

00:13:20.237 --> 00:13:22.437
You win?
I don't think so.

00:13:22.437 --> 00:13:24.204
Enough idling' around.

00:13:24.204 --> 00:13:27.104
What say we get
those engines roarin'!

00:13:27.104 --> 00:13:30.671
<i>Go Speed World Neo!</i>

00:13:30.671 --> 00:13:32.204
(computer voice)
<i>Duel Mode engaged.</i>

00:13:32.204 --> 00:13:35.304
<i>Auto‐pilot activated.</i>

00:13:35.304 --> 00:13:38.937
(Lucas Swank)
Lemme here you
scream for the green!

00:13:38.937 --> 00:13:41.237
(beeping, tires squealing)

00:13:42.404 --> 00:13:43.937
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:13:43.937 --> 00:13:45.637
Lemme show you
how it's done!

00:13:45.637 --> 00:13:48.737
First up, I'm summoning
Raidraptor Skull Eagle!

00:13:52.504 --> 00:13:57.437
Following that, I'm activating
the spell Raidraptor Call!

00:13:57.437 --> 00:14:01.337
This'll let me summon a
second Raidraptor Skull Eagle.

00:14:01.337 --> 00:14:03.204
And now I'll build
the Overlay Network

00:14:03.204 --> 00:14:05.104
with my two
Skull Eagles.

00:14:08.371 --> 00:14:10.404
I Xyz Summon!

00:14:10.404 --> 00:14:12.804
Raidraptor
Fiend Eagle!

00:14:15.137 --> 00:14:17.937
And thanks to my Skull
Eagle's special abilities,

00:14:17.937 --> 00:14:21.571
my Fiend Eagle's attack
points soar to 1600.

00:14:23.971 --> 00:14:27.104
Finally, I activate Fiend
Eagle's special ability!

00:14:27.104 --> 00:14:29.004
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:14:29.004 --> 00:14:32.504
you take damage equal to
my Eagle's attack points!

00:14:38.937 --> 00:14:41.004
(Dennis)
I gotta ground
that bird.

00:14:41.004 --> 00:14:44.537
(Shay)
I place one card face
down and end my turn.

00:14:44.537 --> 00:14:46.804
That's why Shay
is the man to beat.

00:14:46.804 --> 00:14:49.837
First he floors it,
then he soars it!

00:14:49.837 --> 00:14:53.004
He's not wastin' any time
showin' why he rules the
road.

00:14:53.004 --> 00:14:56.971
Is Dashin' Dennis in
over his red head?

00:14:56.971 --> 00:14:58.537
Don't count
me out!

00:14:58.537 --> 00:15:00.371
I'm gonna put
Shay to shame.

00:15:00.371 --> 00:15:03.471
Now it's time to get
this show on the road.

00:15:03.471 --> 00:15:06.104
Since you've got a high‐flying
feathered friend on the field,

00:15:06.104 --> 00:15:08.304
I can get my own
game off the ground

00:15:08.304 --> 00:15:11.671
and summon my Trusty
Performage Wind Drainer!

00:15:13.471 --> 00:15:15.704
When it's brought out,
its level goes down by one.

00:15:17.704 --> 00:15:20.137
This is sure to level
the playing field.

00:15:20.137 --> 00:15:23.304
I summon Performage
Ball Balancer!

00:15:23.304 --> 00:15:25.337
I overlay wind drainer
and Ball Balancer

00:15:25.337 --> 00:15:27.271
to build
the Overlay Network!

00:15:30.804 --> 00:15:34.137
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you

00:15:34.137 --> 00:15:38.104
the fearless, peerless
flying prestidigitator!

00:15:39.404 --> 00:15:44.337
I Xyz Summon Performage
Trapeze Magician!

00:15:47.637 --> 00:15:49.604
He can Xyz
Summon too?!

00:15:49.604 --> 00:15:51.504
McField is Mc‐mazing!

00:15:51.504 --> 00:15:53.604
I use Fiend Eagles
other Overlay Unit

00:15:53.604 --> 00:15:56.671
to activate its
special ability!

00:15:56.671 --> 00:16:00.537
So, once again your life points
are gonna do a disappearing act

00:16:00.537 --> 00:16:01.904
because you
take damage equal

00:16:01.904 --> 00:16:05.071
to Trapeze Magician's
attack points!

00:16:05.071 --> 00:16:07.304
This could be curtains
for Dashin' Dennis!

00:16:07.304 --> 00:16:10.437
Trapeze Magician's
got 2500 attack points!

00:16:10.437 --> 00:16:13.137
McField has 2400
life points!

00:16:13.137 --> 00:16:14.871
If this works...

00:16:14.871 --> 00:16:17.137
It's the end of
the road for him.

00:16:17.137 --> 00:16:19.637
Due to my Magician's
special ability,

00:16:19.637 --> 00:16:23.104
my life points are protected
so I take no damage!

00:16:23.104 --> 00:16:24.737
(giggling)

00:16:26.471 --> 00:16:29.337
Now I'm using one of Trapeze
Magician's Overlay Units

00:16:29.337 --> 00:16:31.137
which lets
it attack twice!

00:16:33.104 --> 00:16:35.771
Trapeze Magician, make
that Eagle vanish!

00:16:37.837 --> 00:16:40.671
(Lucas Swank)
Dennis just turned
this duel upside down!

00:16:40.671 --> 00:16:42.471
Now he's got Shay
on the run!

00:16:54.274 --> 00:16:57.340
(Lucas Swank)
Dennis just turned
this duel upside down!

00:16:57.340 --> 00:16:59.674
Now he's got Shay
on the run!

00:16:59.674 --> 00:17:02.140
Shay's only got
100 life points!

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:04.307
Yeah, he's almost
runnin' on empty!

00:17:04.307 --> 00:17:06.907
Trapeze Magician, what do
you say we end this show

00:17:06.907 --> 00:17:08.940
with a little
hocus pocus?

00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:11.807
I activate the
trap Necro Raptor!

00:17:11.807 --> 00:17:14.707
It blocks your
monster's attack.

00:17:14.707 --> 00:17:18.540
And lets me summon one
Raidraptor from the graveyard:

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.840
Raidraptor Fiend Eagle,
come on back!

00:17:25.307 --> 00:17:26.574
(gasping)

00:17:26.574 --> 00:17:28.874
I can see why you
won nine in a row,

00:17:28.874 --> 00:17:31.507
but winning ten isn't
in the cards!

00:17:33.874 --> 00:17:36.640
Dennis is ridin' 'n
drivin' n' groovin' 'n provin'

00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:38.807
that he's more than a
match for our Shay!

00:17:38.807 --> 00:17:40.607
Unlike the other
Leos I've met,

00:17:40.607 --> 00:17:43.207
you seem to know
what you're doing,

00:17:43.207 --> 00:17:45.474
and that's not
the Leo way!

00:17:45.474 --> 00:17:47.140
I'm activating
the spell card

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.474
Rank‐Up‐Magic
Raid Force!

00:17:50.474 --> 00:17:52.407
I use Raidraptor
Fiend Eagle

00:17:52.407 --> 00:17:56.407
to Xyz Summon another Raidraptor
that's one Rank higher!

00:17:56.407 --> 00:17:58.040
Raidraptor
Force Strix!

00:18:01.307 --> 00:18:04.674
By using one Overlay Unit,
Force Strix lets me

00:18:04.674 --> 00:18:08.307
add Raidraptor Necro Vulture
to my hand and summon it!

00:18:10.174 --> 00:18:14.374
Then I tribute Necro Vulture to
activate its special ability!

00:18:14.374 --> 00:18:17.374
It lets me retrieve
Rank‐Up‐Magic Revolution Force

00:18:17.374 --> 00:18:20.507
from my graveyard
and activate it again!

00:18:20.507 --> 00:18:23.507
I use Force Strix to
Xyz Summon a Raidraptor

00:18:23.507 --> 00:18:26.174
that's one Rank
higher!

00:18:26.174 --> 00:18:29.607
Terror of the skies,
predator of blazing force,

00:18:29.607 --> 00:18:31.940
with wings that slash,
and talons that tear.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.140
Go Rank Up Xyz
Evolution!

00:18:36.140 --> 00:18:40.007
Rise up Rank 5
Raidraptor Blaze Falcon!

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:45.907
By using one overlay unit Blaze
Falcon's special ability

00:18:45.907 --> 00:18:49.874
destroys your monster and
deals you 500 points of damage.

00:18:54.107 --> 00:18:55.207
(yelping)

00:18:55.207 --> 00:18:56.740
Trapeze Magician!

00:18:56.740 --> 00:18:58.874
Has gone bye‐bye!

00:18:58.874 --> 00:19:01.374
And your life points
are about to vanish, too,

00:19:01.374 --> 00:19:04.140
once I activate
Raptor's Ultimate Mace!

00:19:04.140 --> 00:19:05.874
I equip it on Blaze Falcon

00:19:05.874 --> 00:19:08.507
to raise its attack
points by a thousand!

00:19:08.507 --> 00:19:09.907
You're done!

00:19:09.907 --> 00:19:12.007
Blaze Falcon attacks you
directly!

00:19:12.007 --> 00:19:14.440
(Lucas Swank)
Dennis has only
1900 life points!

00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:16.174
<i>This will wipe him out!</i>

00:19:16.174 --> 00:19:17.407
Don't count on it!

00:19:17.407 --> 00:19:18.840
When your monster
attacks me directly,

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.507
Performage Ball Balancer's
special ability

00:19:21.507 --> 00:19:24.407
lets me summon it
from the graveyard.

00:19:24.407 --> 00:19:26.540
(Shay)
You're wasting
your time, McField.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:28.540
Blaze Falcon can
attack you directly

00:19:28.540 --> 00:19:31.207
even if you have a
monster to defend with.

00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:33.140
I activate
Pinch Breaker!

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.174
Your monster's attack
points become the same

00:19:35.174 --> 00:19:37.274
as my monster's
defense points.

00:19:37.274 --> 00:19:39.340
So, it won't be strong
enough to finish me off.

00:19:43.774 --> 00:19:46.240
Dashin' Dennis just
took a big hit,

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:49.974
but that redhead's
keepin' it together.

00:19:49.974 --> 00:19:51.774
You're not out of
the woods yet!

00:19:51.774 --> 00:19:54.007
When Blaze Falcon
deals you damage,

00:19:54.007 --> 00:19:56.240
it also gets to
destroy your monster.

00:19:59.607 --> 00:20:01.807
Man, not only did he
blast my Balancer,

00:20:01.807 --> 00:20:06.507
but his Blaze Falcon's attack
points go back up to 2000.

00:20:06.507 --> 00:20:09.340
I place one card face
down and end my turn.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.107
You're not as incompetent as
the other Leo duelists I faced.

00:20:16.107 --> 00:20:17.507
Are you really
from Leo?

00:20:17.507 --> 00:20:19.207
Of course.

00:20:19.207 --> 00:20:21.740
(Lucas Swank)
They're down to just a
hundred life points each!

00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:24.507
I have no clue who's
gonna win!

00:20:24.507 --> 00:20:27.040
We should give these
people what they came for.

00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:28.674
Let's end with a
show stopper.

00:20:31.174 --> 00:20:35.274
Folks, feast your
peepers on this.

00:20:35.274 --> 00:20:38.740
I've set the Pendulum Scale with
Scale 2 Performage Water Dancer

00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:44.340
and Scale 6 Performage
Fire Dancer!

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.807
Now I can summon monsters
between Level 3 and 5

00:20:47.807 --> 00:20:49.974
all at
the same time!

00:20:49.974 --> 00:20:52.574
I Pendulum Summon!

00:20:52.574 --> 00:20:54.974
Now taking center
stage are a pair

00:20:54.974 --> 00:20:57.807
of Performage
Wing Sandwichmen!

00:20:57.807 --> 00:21:01.474
And a true balancing act,
Performage Ball Balancer.

00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:07.107
A Pendulum Summon?

00:21:07.107 --> 00:21:09.807
That move has all sorts of
crazy written all over it?

00:21:09.807 --> 00:21:11.540
(laughing)

00:21:11.540 --> 00:21:13.774
Just when I thought
I knew what was going on,

00:21:13.774 --> 00:21:15.974
they change the script,
and I'm loving it!

00:21:21.507 --> 00:21:23.574
(Jean Michel Roget)
A Pendulum Summon?

00:21:23.574 --> 00:21:27.074
(woman)
At an underground duel field
beneath New Domino City.

00:21:27.074 --> 00:21:29.340
Send our
agents there now.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:31.440
We have found our
fugitives.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:32.840
