Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V."

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:07.500
(guard)
Welcome to your new
home sweet home.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.100
Well, it's just us now.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.966
Oh. And them.

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:15.133
Ain't ya gonna come say hi?

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:17.333
Uh, yeah, we were
just about to.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:18.600
Too late!

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.200
Gong says leave
those four alone!

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.133
No way, for real?
Gong is that‐‐

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.300
Yuya, so good to see you!

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.066
Guess any friend of Yuya
is a friend of ours.

00:00:29.066 --> 00:00:31.100
I suppose that would
include me, then.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.200
Dennis.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.566
Tokumatsu runs this joint.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:40.166
If you want no trouble,
then hand over your cards.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.400
(Yuya)
Or what?

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:43.066
Or face the wrath
of Tokumatsu!

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.433
No, never!

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:45.666
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:45.666 --> 00:00:49.000
I Synchro Summon!

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.466
Level 8 Flower Cardian
Lightshower!

00:00:55.366 --> 00:00:57.900
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.700
(roaring)

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.233
See‐saw to it, Peformapal Teeter
Totter Hopper!

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:06.733
Crawl to victory,
Peformapal Sellshell Crab!

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.400
I'm activating the trap card
Fraud Freeze,

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.433
so all of your monster's
will be gone!

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:14.433
Oh, no!

00:01:14.433 --> 00:01:16.766
Perhaps now you finally
understand

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.266
that power
is everything, Yuya.

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:21.466
The worst is yet to come!

00:01:21.466 --> 00:01:24.300

Your cards are mine.

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:29.233
Thanks to my
superior skills,

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.233
I have you backed up
against the wall!

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.766
You are no longer able to
Pendulum Summon, dear boy.

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:36.833
My victory is guaranteed!

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:38.433
There's something wrong.

00:02:38.433 --> 00:02:39.433
Hmm?

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:41.033
It's like he's only
out to win!

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:44.266
Hero Chojiro was
never concerned about
winning or losing.

00:02:44.266 --> 00:02:45.966
Hero Chojiro?

00:02:45.966 --> 00:02:47.400
Don't call me that!

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.400
Huh?
Huh?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.966
For my name is...

00:02:49.966 --> 00:02:51.866
Kingpin Chojiro!

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:55.266
The Kingpin hasn't lost since
he arrived at the Facility.

00:02:55.266 --> 00:02:57.900
His M. O. is to pin down
all your strongest monsters

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.533
and keep 'em out of action.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:01.466
Fitting name don't you think?

00:03:01.466 --> 00:03:04.433
Thousands have tried to
dethrone the Kingpin,

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:07.866
but all they got
was a royal beat down!

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:10.233
He stomped them,
and he's gonna stomp you!

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:13.800
Chojiro may have stopped me for
now, but I'm not giving up.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.933
I place one monster
in defense mode

00:03:15.933 --> 00:03:19.500
and then I'll end my turn.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.166
Funny, after all your yapping
about things swinging your way,

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:25.600
all that you are capable of
doing in the end

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.466
is summon a monster
in defense mode.

00:03:28.466 --> 00:03:32.533
Well, as long as I have a card
in play, I still have a chance.

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:35.600
The duelists before you
all felt the same way,

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.066
but none could defeat me,

00:03:37.066 --> 00:03:39.233
and you won't either!

00:03:39.233 --> 00:03:42.566
Due to Flower Cardian
Lightshower's special ability,

00:03:42.566 --> 00:03:45.100
I choose not to draw a card.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.600
This may seem like a drawback,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.400
but in exchange, the next time
you draw a card,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.800
you will take 1,500 points
of damage,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.766
bringing you one step closer
to defeat.

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:56.533
(man) Yeah!
Way to go, Kingpin!

00:03:56.533 --> 00:03:58.366
(second man)
Yeah, you just punked
that pest!

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:00.433
I've warned you
clowns before!

00:04:00.433 --> 00:04:02.200
Silence yourselves!

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.066
I've no need for cheerleaders.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:07.066
Their support is temporary
at best.

00:04:07.066 --> 00:04:11.300
I now rely solely on myself to
outlast those who oppose me.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.300
That guy doesn't get it.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.600
Dueling is for building
your fan base...

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.200
and becoming a celebrity.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.100
Then you're a D‐lister!

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.166
Even your feeble mind can
understand

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:23.266
that you have
no chance to win.

00:04:23.266 --> 00:04:25.300
Accept defeat now and give me
half your cards,

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.500
and I'll spare you further
suffering.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.133
I think I'll hold on
to my cards, thanks.

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:33.333
But there is something I'm
planning to give you.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:35.066
A slice of humble pie!

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:37.266
Some may admire your bravado,

00:04:37.266 --> 00:04:39.333
but it is no match
for my brute power!

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:41.066
I'm not gonna back down!

00:04:41.066 --> 00:04:43.600
So go ahead and show me
what your made of!

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.133
Someone as stubborn as you
will never understand...

00:04:47.133 --> 00:04:48.966
'til I make you understand!

00:04:48.966 --> 00:04:51.400
Lightshower, destroy his
facedown monster

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.000
and rain on his parade!

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.466
You lost another monster that
you cannot afford to lose.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.766
It's my turn.

00:05:00.766 --> 00:05:04.000
(thinking)
I'll drop 1,500 life points
when I draw this card,

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.466
which means I won't have enough
life points left

00:05:06.466 --> 00:05:09.266
to draw another for the rest
of this duel.

00:05:09.266 --> 00:05:11.800
This really has to count
or I'm done for.

00:05:15.133 --> 00:05:18.000
Drawing that card
will cost you.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.333
Lightshower deals you 1,500
points of damage!

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.933
Aah!

00:05:27.933 --> 00:05:30.500
I really hope that card
was worth it, pal.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.133
I'm summoning the monster I just
got in defense mode.

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:40.233
And ending my turn!

00:05:40.233 --> 00:05:42.400
That was pointless.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.500
It's over.

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:48.200
Again, I choose not to draw
a card this turn,

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.066
which means Flower Cardian
Lightshower's special ability

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:53.333
will activate
on your next turn.

00:05:53.333 --> 00:05:57.066
In the meantime, Lightshower,
take out his facedown monster!

00:05:59.166 --> 00:06:01.366
That dude is putting Yuya's
monsters

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:03.533
through the shredder
one at a time!

00:06:03.533 --> 00:06:06.233
The final step in your undoing
has arrived.

00:06:06.233 --> 00:06:08.733
When you draw a card at
the start of your turn,

00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:11.133
your remaining life points
will be wiped out.

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:14.600
And all your cards
will be mine!

00:06:26.894 --> 00:06:29.327
The final step in your undoing
has arrived.

00:06:29.327 --> 00:06:31.794
When you draw a card at
the start of your turn,

00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:34.361
your remaining life points
will be wiped out.

00:06:34.361 --> 00:06:37.361
And all your cards
will be mine!

00:06:37.361 --> 00:06:39.427
You should have
taken the easy way out

00:06:39.427 --> 00:06:41.327
when I gave you
the chance to forfeit

00:06:41.327 --> 00:06:43.261
and give up only
half your cards.

00:06:44.594 --> 00:06:46.827
Now it's too late!

00:06:46.827 --> 00:06:50.261
Hurry up and draw
so I can watch you lose.

00:06:50.261 --> 00:06:54.161
Chojiro used to be my hero
when I was a kid.

00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:56.661
Uh‐huh. He never acted
like this before.

00:06:56.661 --> 00:06:57.894
What happened?

00:06:57.894 --> 00:07:00.694
You mean he wasn't always a
despicable sourpuss?

00:07:00.694 --> 00:07:02.661
It was just the opposite.

00:07:02.661 --> 00:07:05.627
He used to be every kid's
favorite duelist.

00:07:05.627 --> 00:07:07.194
We idolized him.

00:07:07.194 --> 00:07:09.527
Idolized?
You kidding?

00:07:09.527 --> 00:07:11.027
It's true.

00:07:11.027 --> 00:07:13.261
Back then, I was one of his
biggest fans.

00:07:13.261 --> 00:07:15.127
You should've seen him in
action!

00:07:15.127 --> 00:07:16.394
When Hero Chojiro dueled,

00:07:16.394 --> 00:07:18.127
he kept us on the edge
of our seats.

00:07:18.127 --> 00:07:19.794
Be a hero!

00:07:19.794 --> 00:07:22.194
(Crow)
He didn't care about
winning or losing,

00:07:22.194 --> 00:07:25.861
just about making us feel like
every draw was an adventure!

00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:28.294
Even after he became a dueling
sensation,

00:07:28.294 --> 00:07:32.461
Chojiro felt a responsibility to
give back to his fellow Commons.

00:07:32.461 --> 00:07:35.827
I know firsthand, 'cause I was
one of his pupils.

00:07:35.827 --> 00:07:39.494
When trouble broke out in our
hood, Chojiro knew what to do.

00:07:39.494 --> 00:07:41.827
Why are you wasting energy
fighting each other?

00:07:41.827 --> 00:07:43.927
Channel your fury into
something positive,

00:07:43.927 --> 00:07:46.794
like learning how to duel.

00:07:46.794 --> 00:07:49.927
Dueling is the best way for you
to challenge each other.

00:07:49.927 --> 00:07:52.061
You will learn much
about your cards,

00:07:52.061 --> 00:07:55.227
and even more perhaps about
yourselves.

00:07:55.227 --> 00:07:58.894
You may even create bonds that
will last a lifetime.

00:08:01.027 --> 00:08:03.161
(chanting)
Chojiro! Our hero!

00:08:03.161 --> 00:08:04.994
Chojiro!
Our hero!

00:08:04.994 --> 00:08:07.827
Be a hero!

00:08:07.827 --> 00:08:09.427
But look how much
he's changed.

00:08:09.427 --> 00:08:12.327
This Chojiro only cares
about winning duels,

00:08:12.327 --> 00:08:14.327
no matter what
it takes!

00:08:14.327 --> 00:08:16.227
If he was such a superstar
duelist,

00:08:16.227 --> 00:08:19.061
how'd he end up in this
detention dump?

00:08:19.061 --> 00:08:20.227
Good question.

00:08:20.227 --> 00:08:21.961
The last I saw him,

00:08:21.961 --> 00:08:24.361
he was challenging the best
duelists in Tops,

00:08:24.361 --> 00:08:26.527
but he soon left
the dueling scene.

00:08:26.527 --> 00:08:30.161
You must realize how hopeless
your situation has become.

00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:31.561
Surrender.

00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:34.861
End this pointless farce and
accept that you can't win!

00:08:34.861 --> 00:08:38.127
Never!
There's always a chance!

00:08:38.127 --> 00:08:40.894
You can never predict what
will happen in a duel.

00:08:40.894 --> 00:08:42.961
That's what makes it fun!

00:08:42.961 --> 00:08:44.161
Nonsense!

00:08:44.161 --> 00:08:46.261
Dueling has nothing to do
with having fun!

00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:47.627
You're wrong!

00:08:47.627 --> 00:08:52.061
The whole point is to put
a smile on people's faces.

00:08:52.061 --> 00:08:55.294
I learned that from
my mom and dad.

00:08:55.294 --> 00:08:57.927
And the duels I've had proved
that it's true!

00:08:57.927 --> 00:08:59.761
I once thought like you do,

00:08:59.761 --> 00:09:02.394
but I learned the hard way that
in the end,

00:09:02.394 --> 00:09:04.694
power is all that matters.

00:09:04.694 --> 00:09:06.894
While thousands dwell
in luxury

00:09:06.894 --> 00:09:09.861
in the magnificent skylands
above the city,

00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:13.127
far below them, millions
struggle just to survive!

00:09:13.127 --> 00:09:16.094
I could not allow such
injustice to stand!

00:09:16.094 --> 00:09:18.594
That is why I chose to duel
the Topsiders!

00:09:18.594 --> 00:09:20.894
My victories would prove that
the Commons

00:09:20.894 --> 00:09:22.494
were worthy of respect.

00:09:22.494 --> 00:09:24.961
It would bring revolutionary
change!

00:09:24.961 --> 00:09:26.394
Aah!

00:09:26.394 --> 00:09:27.561
But I failed.

00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:29.827
The Topsiders did not duel
fairly.

00:09:29.827 --> 00:09:33.027
They stockpiled the most
powerful cards that
money could buy

00:09:33.027 --> 00:09:35.227
and used them to overpower me!

00:09:35.227 --> 00:09:38.261
And as my wins went away,
so did my fans.

00:09:38.261 --> 00:09:40.361
What were once cheers
were now boos.

00:09:40.361 --> 00:09:44.094
It seemed that in an instant,
I was no longer "Hero" Chojiro.

00:09:44.094 --> 00:09:46.194
My heart was broken.

00:09:46.194 --> 00:09:48.161
From that day on,
I no longer cared

00:09:48.161 --> 00:09:49.827
what people thought anymore.

00:09:49.827 --> 00:09:51.761
All that mattered was winning.

00:09:51.761 --> 00:09:55.627
And that meant not leaving my
fate to the luck of the draw.

00:09:55.627 --> 00:09:57.794
And since I cared so much
about winning,

00:09:57.794 --> 00:10:01.194
I did the unthinkable:
I cheated.

00:10:01.194 --> 00:10:02.761
With this one mistake,

00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:04.994
I went against everything I used
to believe in,

00:10:04.994 --> 00:10:08.161
causing me to fall in a downward
spiral that led me

00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:12.194
to the detention facility
I now call home.

00:10:12.194 --> 00:10:13.894
(cell doors close)

00:10:13.894 --> 00:10:16.027
But that's how life goes
sometimes.

00:10:16.027 --> 00:10:17.927
I'm no longer naive like you.

00:10:17.927 --> 00:10:19.361
I tried to bridge the gap

00:10:19.361 --> 00:10:21.661
between Tops and Commons
through dueling,

00:10:21.661 --> 00:10:24.894
but in the end, all it did
was put me in this dump.

00:10:24.894 --> 00:10:27.194
Dueling isn't for fun
and entertainment,

00:10:27.194 --> 00:10:29.627
it's just a means of survival.

00:10:29.627 --> 00:10:31.894
And with this mentality,
I have survived,

00:10:31.894 --> 00:10:33.927
and now I am the boss here.

00:10:33.927 --> 00:10:37.394
So I may no longer have my
dreams, but I do have my power.

00:10:37.394 --> 00:10:39.294
And this power
will crush you.

00:10:39.294 --> 00:10:41.361
Don't be so sure!

00:10:41.361 --> 00:10:44.527
I'm gonna find a way to pull
this out, no matter what!

00:10:56.194 --> 00:10:57.927
This duel is over!

00:10:57.927 --> 00:11:01.694
Flower Cardian Lightshower's
special ability activates,

00:11:01.694 --> 00:11:04.061
dealing you enough damage
to defeat you!

00:11:04.061 --> 00:11:06.094
I don't think so!

00:11:06.094 --> 00:11:08.894
I drew Performapal Rain Goat!

00:11:08.894 --> 00:11:12.461
And by sending it to the
graveyard, I take no damage!

00:11:12.461 --> 00:11:14.261
Yuya!
Yuya!

00:11:14.261 --> 00:11:18.294
Maybe Chojiro isn't as
unbeatable as he thinks he is.

00:11:18.294 --> 00:11:20.194
(scoffs)
You were lucky,

00:11:20.194 --> 00:11:21.794
but your ruin is still at hand!

00:11:21.794 --> 00:11:23.427
Unless it's not!

00:11:23.427 --> 00:11:26.494
Since I sent a Performapal from
my hand to the graveyard,

00:11:26.494 --> 00:11:28.627
I can summon
Teeter Totter Hopper

00:11:28.627 --> 00:11:31.294
from the graveyard in
defense mode!

00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:32.794
That card's back?

00:11:32.794 --> 00:11:34.894
I bet it will
tip the duel Yuya's way.

00:11:34.894 --> 00:11:37.494
Once per turn,
Teeter Totter Hopper

00:11:37.494 --> 00:11:39.461
can't be destroyed
in battle.

00:11:39.461 --> 00:11:41.794
And if I choose to send it
to the graveyard

00:11:41.794 --> 00:11:43.127
at the end of your turn,

00:11:43.127 --> 00:11:45.394
I can add another Performapal
from my graveyard

00:11:45.394 --> 00:11:47.827
that's Level 3 or below
to my hand!

00:11:47.827 --> 00:11:49.627
Impossible!
Hmm.

00:11:49.627 --> 00:11:51.227
So then that means...

00:11:51.227 --> 00:11:53.394
Yuya can bring back
Performapal Raingoat.

00:11:53.394 --> 00:11:55.161
And on Chojiro's turn,

00:11:55.161 --> 00:11:58.161
Yuya will use Teeter Totter
Hopper to protect himself.

00:11:58.161 --> 00:12:00.227
And at the end of his turn,
Yuya can send it

00:12:00.227 --> 00:12:02.694
to the graveyard to bring
Raingoat back.

00:12:02.694 --> 00:12:05.794
So when Chojiro tries to use
Lightshower's special ability

00:12:05.794 --> 00:12:07.894
again to wipe out Yuya's life
points,

00:12:07.894 --> 00:12:10.494
all Yuya has to do is send
Raingoat to the graveyard

00:12:10.494 --> 00:12:12.661
to take no damage,
and that also allows him

00:12:12.661 --> 00:12:14.661
to bring back Teeter Totter
Hopper again.

00:12:14.661 --> 00:12:18.094
Oh, I get it!
Yuya's creating an infinite loop

00:12:18.094 --> 00:12:20.061
where he'll take no damage.

00:12:20.061 --> 00:12:21.727
Impossible!

00:12:21.727 --> 00:12:24.227
No one ever stymied
the boss's combo before.

00:12:24.227 --> 00:12:27.694
There's always a first.

00:12:27.694 --> 00:12:30.827
And you're going
to be the last!

00:12:44.457 --> 00:12:46.823
Guard, we wanna
see the duel!

00:12:46.823 --> 00:12:48.190
Hey, let us in!

00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:49.357
It's private.

00:12:49.357 --> 00:12:50.423
Aw, come on!

00:12:50.423 --> 00:12:52.257
We haven't seen
a good battle in ages!

00:12:52.257 --> 00:12:53.990
We'll make it
worth your while!

00:12:53.990 --> 00:12:56.190
Yeah, give us a break!
Come on!

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:57.723
Hurry or we'll miss it!
Let us in!

00:12:57.723 --> 00:12:59.357
Huh?

00:13:01.323 --> 00:13:02.857
(prisoner)
Come on, we're gonna miss
the best part!

00:13:02.857 --> 00:13:05.390
Who's winning?
The Kingpin for sure!

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.590
Keep dueling!

00:13:07.590 --> 00:13:10.223
Looks like everybody's
backing the Boss!

00:13:10.223 --> 00:13:11.790
Yeah, but all
the backing in the world

00:13:11.790 --> 00:13:13.723
ain't gonna help the Boss
get around that kid's

00:13:13.723 --> 00:13:16.557
"infinite loop" card combo
he just threw down?

00:13:16.557 --> 00:13:18.490
Eh, that looks like
a showstopper,

00:13:18.490 --> 00:13:19.923
but the boss
can beat it easy.

00:13:19.923 --> 00:13:22.890
If there's a loop, then there
has to be a loop hole, right?

00:13:22.890 --> 00:13:25.057
Just slip an attack through
the hole and it's over.

00:13:25.057 --> 00:13:26.323
There's a hole all right,

00:13:26.323 --> 00:13:28.757
but it's where
your brain ought to be!

00:13:28.757 --> 00:13:31.057
And with that,
I'll end my turn.

00:13:31.057 --> 00:13:33.823
Now that I just beat your
unbeatable strategy,

00:13:33.823 --> 00:13:36.023
I can't wait to see
what's up next.

00:13:36.023 --> 00:13:37.257
Now let's have some fun!

00:13:37.257 --> 00:13:40.190
I already told you I'm not
dueling to have fun!

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:41.990
I'm dueling to defeat you!

00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:46.557
It's my turn,
and I choose to draw!

00:13:46.557 --> 00:13:47.557
He's gonna draw?

00:13:47.557 --> 00:13:49.023
What about
his strategy?

00:13:49.023 --> 00:13:51.890
Looks like the old grump decided
to shift gears.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:54.090
(prisoner)
Whoa, he's gonna draw?

00:13:56.290 --> 00:13:59.423
(thinking)
It seems like forever since
I risked my fate

00:13:59.423 --> 00:14:01.490
on drawing the perfect card.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:04.190
And I must admit,
it feels good.

00:14:04.190 --> 00:14:05.557
(chuckles)

00:14:05.557 --> 00:14:08.290
Wait. That can't be a grin
on his face, can it?

00:14:08.290 --> 00:14:10.623
(thinking)
I spent years trying
to avoid risk,

00:14:10.623 --> 00:14:14.790
first by cheating and then by
inventing a risk‐free strategy.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.723
But the truth is,
I miss the thrill

00:14:16.723 --> 00:14:19.223
of taking a chance on
the next card.

00:14:19.223 --> 00:14:21.557
(chanting)
Hero Chojiro!
Hero Chojiro!

00:14:21.557 --> 00:14:24.223
Hero Chojiro! Hero Chojiro!

00:14:24.223 --> 00:14:26.623
Hero Chojiro!
Hero Chojiro!

00:14:26.623 --> 00:14:29.057
Hero Chojiro! Hero Chojiro!

00:14:29.057 --> 00:14:30.523
Hero Chojiro!
Hero Chojiro!

00:14:30.523 --> 00:14:32.923
That's it, guys!
Crank it up!

00:14:32.923 --> 00:14:34.890
Make this cellblock rock!

00:14:34.890 --> 00:14:36.657
Hero Chojiro!
Hero Chojiro!

00:14:36.657 --> 00:14:38.890
Hero Chojiro! Hero Chojiro!

00:14:38.890 --> 00:14:40.157
(thinking)
Incredible.

00:14:40.157 --> 00:14:43.490
I've never seen the other
inmates so happy before.

00:14:45.357 --> 00:14:46.890
(laughs)

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:48.357
All right, then!

00:14:48.357 --> 00:14:50.023
If you jokers want fun and
excitement,

00:14:50.023 --> 00:14:51.790
then that's what you'll get!

00:14:51.790 --> 00:14:55.990
(thinking)
'Cause I now see that my true
fans have never left me.

00:14:55.990 --> 00:14:58.623
Be a hero!

00:14:58.623 --> 00:15:00.623
(cheering)

00:15:00.623 --> 00:15:02.057
Oh, yes!

00:15:02.057 --> 00:15:05.457
I've drawn the spell
Super Koi Koi!

00:15:05.457 --> 00:15:07.457
Awesome!
That spell is sweet!

00:15:07.457 --> 00:15:10.357
Due to Super Koi Koi's effect,
I draw three cards!

00:15:10.357 --> 00:15:13.057
If any of them are
Flower Cardians,

00:15:13.057 --> 00:15:14.590
I can summon them!

00:15:14.590 --> 00:15:17.357
But if they're not, I have to
send them to the graveyard,

00:15:17.357 --> 00:15:20.857
and I take 1,000 points of
damage for each card.

00:15:22.423 --> 00:15:26.057
Get ready, 'cause every card is
an adventure!

00:15:26.057 --> 00:15:27.657
(prisoner)
"Chojiro the Hero" is back!

00:15:27.657 --> 00:15:30.423
Dueling is a reflection of the
way we should live our lives.

00:15:30.423 --> 00:15:31.857
(all)
Aw.

00:15:31.857 --> 00:15:33.957
Some days, you win,
some days, you lose,

00:15:33.957 --> 00:15:37.057
but what's important is
that you enjoy the journey.

00:15:37.057 --> 00:15:41.557
Ultimately,
everyone wins if...

00:15:41.557 --> 00:15:43.257
we all have fun!

00:15:43.257 --> 00:15:44.990
(all)
Too true!

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.590
(both)
Too fun!

00:15:48.190 --> 00:15:50.690
It's time to draw
the first card!

00:15:50.690 --> 00:15:52.390
Yeah!
Draw!

00:15:52.390 --> 00:15:54.590
(both)
Be a hero!

00:15:54.590 --> 00:15:56.823
Aagghh!

00:15:56.823 --> 00:15:59.690
I drew Flower Cardian Clover
With Boar!

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:01.390
(all cheering)

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:02.890
Card two.

00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.123
(both)
Do it, Chojiro!

00:16:05.123 --> 00:16:07.357
Be a hero!

00:16:07.357 --> 00:16:10.623
This time it's Flower Cardian
Maple with Deer!

00:16:10.623 --> 00:16:13.657
Now card number three!

00:16:13.657 --> 00:16:15.090
Aagghh!

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:19.523
The third card is Flower Cardian
Peony with Butterfly!

00:16:19.523 --> 00:16:21.257
(man)
Whoa! The boss sure has
a green thumb!

00:16:21.257 --> 00:16:23.257
Due to Super Koi Koi's effect,

00:16:23.257 --> 00:16:25.257
all three monsters attack and
defense points

00:16:25.257 --> 00:16:28.790
are reduced to zero
and change to Level 2!

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.090
Since they all have the same
Level,

00:16:31.090 --> 00:16:32.823
I can tune these monsters

00:16:32.823 --> 00:16:36.023
and give rise to an entirely
new creation!

00:16:38.423 --> 00:16:40.323
Behold, my friends,

00:16:40.323 --> 00:16:42.390
as the majestic beauty of
the butterfly

00:16:42.390 --> 00:16:45.223
tunes itself to the valor and
swiftness of the deer

00:16:45.223 --> 00:16:47.423
and to the bravery of the boar!

00:16:47.423 --> 00:16:50.923
Now I Synchro Summon!

00:16:50.923 --> 00:16:55.390
Come forth, Flower Cardian
Boardefly!

00:16:57.757 --> 00:16:59.423
It's on!

00:16:59.423 --> 00:17:02.823
Flower Cardian Lightshower, take
out Teeter Totter Hopper!

00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.423
Except Teeter Totter Hopper

00:17:04.423 --> 00:17:08.390
can use its special ability to
save itself!

00:17:08.390 --> 00:17:10.323
But it can only stop
one attack!

00:17:10.323 --> 00:17:13.657
Boardefly, it is now your turn
to take that Hopper out.

00:17:13.657 --> 00:17:16.290
And even if your monster is in
defense mode,

00:17:16.290 --> 00:17:19.490
Boardefly can still deal you
damage.

00:17:22.057 --> 00:17:23.123
Yuya!

00:17:23.123 --> 00:17:24.890
That ends my turn.

00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:27.190
With your life points so
dangerously low,

00:17:27.190 --> 00:17:29.423
you have no possible hope of
winning this duel,

00:17:29.423 --> 00:17:32.957
and yet I feel certain that you
will not concede defeat.

00:17:32.957 --> 00:17:35.323
You're right.
Huh.

00:17:35.323 --> 00:17:37.390
And it's time I take
center stage!

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:38.657
(snaps fingers)

00:17:38.657 --> 00:17:41.190
Our showdown is reaching
its climax.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:42.857
It looks like I'm down.

00:17:42.857 --> 00:17:46.923
But wait. I'm about to give
you a demo of my dueltaining
skills!

00:17:46.923 --> 00:17:48.857
You ain't seen nothing yet!

00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:01.596
(cheering)

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:06.163
It begins now!

00:18:06.163 --> 00:18:07.196
Oh, yeah!

00:18:07.196 --> 00:18:10.263
I activate the spell
Pendulum Storm!

00:18:10.263 --> 00:18:12.763
It blows away both of my
Pendulum Monsters!

00:18:15.230 --> 00:18:17.730
Wait! He's getting rid
of his own cards?

00:18:17.730 --> 00:18:19.463
Just bear with me.

00:18:19.463 --> 00:18:21.163
I'm bringing down the curtain
on one act

00:18:21.163 --> 00:18:22.896
so I can bring up another.

00:18:22.896 --> 00:18:24.563
It's way more fun that way.

00:18:26.630 --> 00:18:28.896
In exchange,
Pendulum Storm

00:18:28.896 --> 00:18:30.496
destroys one of your
spell or trap cards.

00:18:33.396 --> 00:18:35.330
Fraud Freeze isfinito!

00:18:35.330 --> 00:18:38.430
Time for Yuya to heat things
up and burn this guy.

00:18:38.430 --> 00:18:41.830
I set the Pendulum Scale with
Peformapal Sellshell Crab

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:44.096
and Performapal Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:18:44.096 --> 00:18:48.263
I'm taking control of
this duel, starting now!

00:18:56.163 --> 00:18:59.696
Now I can summon Level 3
monsters all at the same time!

00:18:59.696 --> 00:19:01.496
Crank it up, Yuya!

00:19:01.496 --> 00:19:04.130
(chanting)
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:19:04.130 --> 00:19:06.630
Pendulum!
Pendulum!

00:19:06.630 --> 00:19:09.296
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:19:09.296 --> 00:19:12.063
Pendulum!
Pendulum!

00:19:12.063 --> 00:19:13.063
Pendulum! Pendulum!

00:19:13.063 --> 00:19:14.530
(Yuya)
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:19:14.530 --> 00:19:17.996
Carve the arc of victory!

00:19:17.996 --> 00:19:23.963
My monsters are ready...
to swing into action!

00:19:23.963 --> 00:19:27.663
Show some bite, Performapal Bit
Bite Turtle!

00:19:27.663 --> 00:19:30.363
Make some magic,
Timegazer Magician!

00:19:30.363 --> 00:19:31.763
Quick!

00:19:31.763 --> 00:19:34.763
Bit Bite Turtle, chomp into
Flower Cardian Lightshowers!

00:19:34.763 --> 00:19:36.363
Have you lost your mind?

00:19:36.363 --> 00:19:37.663
Bit Bite Turtle's
attack points

00:19:37.663 --> 00:19:40.063
are miniscule compared to
Lightshower's.

00:19:42.563 --> 00:19:44.796
What? What's wrong with
my Lightshower?

00:19:44.796 --> 00:19:47.463
When my monster is destroyed,
so is yours!

00:19:47.463 --> 00:19:51.796
Take out my Turtle and the same
fate is shelled out to you!

00:19:51.796 --> 00:19:54.730
But you will still take damage,
so you lose!

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:55.796
Nope!

00:19:55.796 --> 00:19:57.696
Odd‐Eyes, use your special
ability!

00:19:57.696 --> 00:20:01.563
When my Pendulum monster
battles, I take no damage!

00:20:01.563 --> 00:20:04.163
So I'm safe and sound!

00:20:04.163 --> 00:20:07.630
That was unexpected,
and very impressive.

00:20:07.630 --> 00:20:11.296
Well, wait 'til you see
Sellshell Crab's
Pendulum ability!

00:20:11.296 --> 00:20:14.063
When a Pendulum Monster
on my field gets destroyed,

00:20:14.063 --> 00:20:16.163
I don't sweat it,
because Sellshell Crab

00:20:16.163 --> 00:20:18.396
can summon a monster
from my Pendulum Zone!

00:20:18.396 --> 00:20:21.096
I'm putting you on
battle duty, Odd‐Eyes!

00:20:21.096 --> 00:20:22.396
(roaring)

00:20:24.596 --> 00:20:25.730
We're all set!

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:29.030
Odd‐Eyes, attack Boardefly!

00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.830
I'll save my monster
by playing Fraud Check!

00:20:31.830 --> 00:20:33.696
None of my Flower Cardians

00:20:33.696 --> 00:20:37.163
can be destroyed in battle
during this turn.

00:20:37.163 --> 00:20:39.696
That rat!
But he'll still take damage.

00:20:39.696 --> 00:20:42.663
And Odd‐Eyes can double that
damage!

00:20:42.663 --> 00:20:44.296
You see, whenever Odd‐Eyes

00:20:44.296 --> 00:20:46.696
battles a monster that's
Level 5 or above,

00:20:46.696 --> 00:20:49.063
it's special ability kicks in.

00:20:49.063 --> 00:20:51.763
Aah!

00:20:51.763 --> 00:20:53.763
And I'll add to
the shock and awe

00:20:53.763 --> 00:20:55.896
with the spell
Pendulum Climax!

00:20:55.896 --> 00:20:57.396
Uhh! Arrgghh!

00:20:57.396 --> 00:20:59.663
By tributing my Timegazer
Magician,

00:20:59.663 --> 00:21:02.363
I can take a monster from your
graveyard

00:21:02.363 --> 00:21:05.096
that's the same Level
and equip it to Odd‐Eyes!

00:21:05.096 --> 00:21:08.963
I'm equipping your
Flower Cardian Cherry Blossom
with Curtain!

00:21:08.963 --> 00:21:11.063
Half the attack points
from your monster

00:21:11.063 --> 00:21:13.530
will be added to Odd‐Eyes'
attack points!

00:21:13.530 --> 00:21:15.696
Your dueling style is
truly entertaining.

00:21:15.696 --> 00:21:18.030
And I saved
the best moves for last!

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:21.496
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon is
allowed to attack again!

00:21:21.496 --> 00:21:25.163
Odd‐Eyes, attack with
Spiral Flame Strike.

00:21:29.363 --> 00:21:31.763
It deals double the damage to
finish you off!

00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:44.463
Boss!
Are you okay?

00:21:44.463 --> 00:21:47.930
Mm. I have never been better.

00:21:50.030 --> 00:21:54.763
I must admit, dueling you
has been great fun.

00:21:54.763 --> 00:21:57.496
(all talking)

00:21:57.496 --> 00:21:59.030
Chojiro!
Our hero!

00:21:59.030 --> 00:22:01.030
Chojiro! Our hero!

00:22:01.030 --> 00:22:02.930
Chojiro!
Our hero!

00:22:02.930 --> 00:22:04.730
Chojiro! Our hero!

00:22:04.730 --> 00:22:06.796
Chojiro!
Our hero!

00:22:06.796 --> 00:22:08.896
Chojiro! Our hero!

00:22:08.896 --> 00:22:10.896
Chojiro!
Our hero!

00:22:10.896 --> 00:22:12.996
Chojiro! Our hero!

00:22:12.996 --> 00:22:15.630
Be a hero!

00:22:15.630 --> 00:22:19.330
(prisoners)
Be a hero!

00:22:19.330 --> 00:22:22.263
(Jean Michel Roget)
Is my special guest
enjoying her stay?

00:22:22.263 --> 00:22:25.296
When we brought her in, the
detainee was uncooperative.

00:22:25.296 --> 00:22:27.230
She has since settled down,
however.

00:22:27.230 --> 00:22:29.263
Ah, very good.

00:22:29.263 --> 00:22:32.530
Then I believe it's time
that I pay her a visit...

00:22:32.530 --> 00:22:35.030
personally.
