Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh Arc V"...

00:00:04.636 --> 00:00:07.369
(announcer)
Time to mosey on up
to our next big match‐up,

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:11.502
with newcomer Zuzu Boyle
takingon the legendary Hiro
Chojiro!

00:00:12.736 --> 00:00:13.836
Zuzu?

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:16.869
This couldn't
be worse.

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.302
No matter who wins,

00:00:18.302 --> 00:00:21.036
one of my friends is going to
that underground trash heap

00:00:21.036 --> 00:00:21.969
for good.

00:00:23.802 --> 00:00:25.369
(Zuzu screaming)

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.202
Let's duel!

00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:31.202
Mozarta, bring down the house
with your most powerful strain!

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:34.102
Graceful Wave!

00:00:34.836 --> 00:00:35.736
I play...

00:00:35.736 --> 00:00:37.236
Evasion!

00:00:37.236 --> 00:00:39.902
To duck your
monster's attack!

00:00:39.902 --> 00:00:42.102
I admire you
for not giving up.

00:00:42.102 --> 00:00:44.602
Just what is it
that keeps you going?

00:00:44.602 --> 00:00:46.536
I'm sending a message
to someone.

00:00:46.536 --> 00:00:48.336
I know
he's feeling pretty down.

00:00:48.336 --> 00:00:51.102
But he has to remember
why he duels...

00:00:51.102 --> 00:00:52.936
He duels to dueltain!

00:00:52.936 --> 00:00:56.108
And I want to remind him,
that for us dueltainers,

00:00:56.108 --> 00:00:57.841
it's always showtime!

00:00:57.841 --> 00:00:58.941
Agh!

00:00:58.941 --> 00:01:00.141
Bloom Diva!

00:01:00.141 --> 00:01:02.474
Wrecking Refrain!

00:01:06.674 --> 00:01:08.408
(announcer)
<i>It's over!</i>

00:01:08.408 --> 00:01:12.574
Zuzu has won
this duel!

00:01:12.574 --> 00:01:14.441
You did it, Zuzu.

00:01:14.441 --> 00:01:16.208
Way to duel.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.541
Well, Yuya,

00:01:17.541 --> 00:01:21.008
I hope this duel makes you
want to swing into action.

00:01:21.008 --> 00:01:22.408
Thanks, Zuzu.

00:01:22.408 --> 00:01:23.608
You were awesome.

00:01:25.441 --> 00:01:29.308
I hope I can be awesome,
just like you are.

Congrats, Zuzu!

00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:34.841
I'm proud
of you.

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:35.841
Thing is...

00:02:35.841 --> 00:02:37.574
I know your win
should cheer me up.

00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.474
But how can it?

00:02:39.474 --> 00:02:43.108
After all, losing to Jack
is still on my mind

00:02:43.108 --> 00:02:45.274
and now Chojiro is, too.

00:02:45.274 --> 00:02:47.441
He's been sent
underground!

00:02:50.674 --> 00:02:53.608
All because...
he just tried...

00:02:53.608 --> 00:02:56.008
to be a friend
when I needed one.

00:02:56.008 --> 00:02:58.241
(announcer)
Well, duelin' buckaroos
and buckarettes,

00:02:58.241 --> 00:03:00.441
sounds like that last match
has y'all hankerin'

00:03:00.441 --> 00:03:03.074
for more
monsters and mayhem!

00:03:03.074 --> 00:03:04.874
So I've got some
great news.

00:03:04.874 --> 00:03:06.308
<i>There is more!</i>

00:03:06.308 --> 00:03:07.808
So sit back in
your saddles

00:03:07.808 --> 00:03:11.641
and get ready
for more duelin'!

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:13.041
From yours truly!

00:03:13.041 --> 00:03:15.874
C'mon, c'mon,
please let it be me.

00:03:15.874 --> 00:03:19.274
Presenting the last match of
the Friendship Cup's first
day,

00:03:19.274 --> 00:03:21.141
<i>Tony vs. Celina!</i>

00:03:21.141 --> 00:03:22.241
Celina?

00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.341
Celina?

00:03:23.341 --> 00:03:25.374
Here's hoping she brought her
A‐game,

00:03:25.374 --> 00:03:28.674
'cause she'll be facing the
Commons' fast‐rising
superstar,

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:30.174
<i>Tony Zomboni!</i>

00:03:31.574 --> 00:03:34.674
Guess they're saving the best
for last‐‐ Lame‐O's!

00:03:34.674 --> 00:03:37.141
Oh, well‐‐
Guess I get the day off then.

00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:38.408
No problem.

00:03:38.408 --> 00:03:41.674
If I'm not dueling, I'll just do
the next best thing.

00:03:44.208 --> 00:03:46.941
Get some shuteye and
start maxin' and relaxin'.

00:03:46.941 --> 00:03:47.774
Yes!

00:03:47.774 --> 00:03:49.174
Tony's one of us Commons!

00:03:49.174 --> 00:03:51.241
When he wins, he'll show
those Topsiders

00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.408
that we're a force
to be reckoned with!

00:03:53.408 --> 00:03:55.108
(growling)

00:03:55.108 --> 00:03:57.974
You think it should be you
who battles this girl.

00:03:57.974 --> 00:03:59.608
Am I right?

00:03:59.608 --> 00:04:00.774
Well...

00:04:00.774 --> 00:04:02.974
That match will
happen in due time.

00:04:02.974 --> 00:04:06.408
You see, if Celina is the
duelist I believe she is,

00:04:06.408 --> 00:04:08.441
she'll win this match
and keep winning

00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:10.008
all the way to the finals.

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:11.808
And as she rises
in the ranks,

00:04:11.808 --> 00:04:14.208
her popularity
will rise as well.

00:04:14.208 --> 00:04:16.641
And that's when you will
crush her.

00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:19.274
And Jack Atlas afterwards.

00:04:20.974 --> 00:04:22.374
For you see,

00:04:22.374 --> 00:04:25.074
when we've destroyed the city's
two biggest dueling stars,

00:04:25.074 --> 00:04:28.008
the people's hearts
and souls will be crushed.

00:04:28.008 --> 00:04:30.508
They won't have the wherewithal
to fight back,

00:04:30.508 --> 00:04:33.474
and when
I take over this city,

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.374
it will be checkmate.

00:04:42.908 --> 00:04:45.874
If Celina loses
this upcoming duel,

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:48.374
she'll meet the same fate
as Gong and Chojiro.

00:04:48.374 --> 00:04:51.274
She'll be taken to the garbage
dump underground,

00:04:51.274 --> 00:04:53.208
banished
and locked away!

00:04:53.208 --> 00:04:55.474
And they call this
the Friendship Cup?!

00:04:55.474 --> 00:04:57.541
Well, that's just
a big lie!

00:04:57.541 --> 00:04:59.474
You hear me?
Hey!

00:04:59.474 --> 00:05:01.474
You have to stop
this tournament now!

00:05:01.474 --> 00:05:04.408
Come on, I know that
you're listening!

00:05:04.408 --> 00:05:05.441
(announcer)
<i>Yee‐ha!</i>

00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.874
<i>This may well be</i>

00:05:06.874 --> 00:05:09.308
the rootin'est, tootin'est
duel of the day so far!

00:05:09.308 --> 00:05:12.141
These two cardslingers aren't
holding anything back!

00:05:12.141 --> 00:05:14.874
(crowd roaring)

00:05:14.874 --> 00:05:17.741
Right now, Tony's in
the driver's seat!

00:05:17.741 --> 00:05:21.574
Will Celina be able to fend
off his frightful fiends?

00:05:22.041 --> 00:05:22.874
My turn.

00:05:22.874 --> 00:05:24.308
Here goes!

00:05:24.308 --> 00:05:25.308
First up...

00:05:25.308 --> 00:05:27.674
I play Lunalight Purple
Butterfly!

00:05:30.241 --> 00:05:32.474
Next I'm activating
the spell card

00:05:32.474 --> 00:05:34.208
Polymerization!

00:05:34.208 --> 00:05:36.641
Now I can fuse
Lunalight Cat Dancer

00:05:36.641 --> 00:05:39.774
and Lunalight Purple
Butterfly!

00:05:39.774 --> 00:05:42.141
By combining the reflexes
of a fierce feline

00:05:42.141 --> 00:05:44.741
with the fluttering fury
of a nighttime huntress,

00:05:44.741 --> 00:05:47.408
I can create
a new lunar legend!

00:05:50.574 --> 00:05:52.308
I Fusion Summon!

00:05:52.308 --> 00:05:54.408
Now appear
sleek creature of the night,

00:05:54.408 --> 00:05:57.674
and ready those razor‐sharp
claws!

00:05:57.674 --> 00:06:01.141
Lunalight Panther Dancer
is on the prowl!

00:06:04.774 --> 00:06:06.508
<i>Meow!</i>

00:06:06.508 --> 00:06:09.841
That monster's clawpaws are
nothing to sneeze about!

00:06:09.841 --> 00:06:10.941
<i>But you know what is?</i>

00:06:10.941 --> 00:06:14.074
Being stuck in a room
with that thing!

00:06:15.308 --> 00:06:18.441
What?I happen to be allergic
to cats, okay?

00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.908
<i>So much dander.</i>

00:06:19.908 --> 00:06:21.308
Excellent.

00:06:21.308 --> 00:06:22.808
Good move, Celina.

00:06:22.808 --> 00:06:24.741
You're on your way.

00:06:24.741 --> 00:06:27.574
Your Panther's about
to take a permanent cat nap!

00:06:27.574 --> 00:06:30.741
I activate Bottomless
Trap Hole!

00:06:36.241 --> 00:06:38.574
Wrong‐‐ Panther Dancer
can't be destroyed

00:06:38.574 --> 00:06:40.808
by your card's effects.

00:06:40.808 --> 00:06:42.174
Toldja she's sleek.

00:06:42.174 --> 00:06:43.808
Uh‐oh!

00:06:43.808 --> 00:06:45.741
And she's got
more moves than just that.

00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.141
You see, now you're in
for double trouble!

00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:49.741
What's that mean?

00:06:49.741 --> 00:06:51.274
Watch and see!

00:06:51.274 --> 00:06:53.408
Attack
Archfiend Zombie Skull!

00:06:53.408 --> 00:06:55.408
Cataclawsmic
Strike!

00:06:57.974 --> 00:06:59.608
You cut my life points
down a bit,

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:03.308
but it seems your Panther's not
allowed to destroy my monsters.

00:07:03.308 --> 00:07:05.308
And that's
not good for you!

00:07:05.308 --> 00:07:08.708
'Cause I activate
the Equip Spell Zombie Heart!

00:07:08.708 --> 00:07:10.141
When Zombie‐Skull battles

00:07:10.141 --> 00:07:12.108
a monster that has
more attack points,

00:07:12.108 --> 00:07:15.141
you take damage equal
to its attack points,

00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:18.441
which is
a whopping 2,500.

00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:21.274
That's exactly how many life
points you have left!

00:07:21.274 --> 00:07:23.808
In other words,
this duel is over.

00:07:23.808 --> 00:07:24.974
You've lost!

00:07:24.974 --> 00:07:26.308
Don't think so.

00:07:26.308 --> 00:07:28.741
Remember when I said you
were in double trouble?

00:07:28.741 --> 00:07:30.208
Well, here it comes!

00:07:30.208 --> 00:07:31.208
Whoa!
You don't mean‐‐

00:07:31.208 --> 00:07:33.674
Panther Dancer gets
two attacks!

00:07:33.674 --> 00:07:37.441
And my Panther can destroy
your monster this time!

00:07:44.541 --> 00:07:47.474
And when Panther Dancer
destroys your Zombie‐Skull,

00:07:47.474 --> 00:07:50.541
it gains 200
attack points.

00:07:51.574 --> 00:07:52.941
Wait, I don't get it.

00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:56.741
What good will 200 extra attack
points do Panther Dancer now?

00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:58.508
Your cat isn't able
to attack anymore.

00:07:58.508 --> 00:08:00.308
But it can.

00:08:00.308 --> 00:08:04.174
Panther Dancer doesn't just get
to attack one of your monsters
twice‐‐

00:08:04.174 --> 00:08:06.774
She's allowed to attack
all of them twice!

00:08:06.774 --> 00:08:08.041
Tony!

00:08:08.041 --> 00:08:10.274
(Zuzu) So let 'er
rip, Panther Dancer!

00:08:10.274 --> 00:08:14.374
Take down his monsters
and win us this duel!

00:08:16.374 --> 00:08:18.574
Celina showed what she can do,

00:08:18.574 --> 00:08:20.774
but I gave up my chance.

00:08:20.774 --> 00:08:22.041
(announcer)
<i>And we have our winner!</i>

00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:24.941
It's Celina!
You go, girl!

00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:26.774
Never mind my
cat allergy.

00:08:26.774 --> 00:08:29.308
You're "purr‐fect"
in every way!

00:08:29.308 --> 00:08:32.041
I can't wait to see
more of your moves!

00:08:32.041 --> 00:08:34.974
Yes, indeed,
I can't wait either.

00:08:34.974 --> 00:08:38.374
Celina was even more impressive
than I had anticipated.

00:08:38.374 --> 00:08:42.908
And just listen to that crowd
of simpletons cheer for her.

00:08:42.908 --> 00:08:45.608
Everything is going
according to plan.

00:08:45.608 --> 00:08:47.608
Celina!

00:08:47.608 --> 00:08:49.274
(announcer)
<i>And that's all, folks!</i>

00:08:49.274 --> 00:08:52.874
The first day of dustups at
the Friendship Cup is now
over!

00:08:52.874 --> 00:08:57.441
But don't worry, this
rodeo's just revvin' up!

00:08:57.441 --> 00:08:58.374
(heavy sigh of relief)

00:08:58.374 --> 00:09:00.374
♪ 'Til then! ♪

00:09:00.374 --> 00:09:04.841
Remember, our city is one
and we're here to have fun!

00:09:04.841 --> 00:09:06.808
All right!
I love it!

00:09:06.808 --> 00:09:07.908
<i>Yeah!</i>

00:09:07.908 --> 00:09:09.374
Now let's hear it
for the cowgirl

00:09:09.374 --> 00:09:11.341
whose play‐by‐play
makes your day!

00:09:11.341 --> 00:09:14.574
<i>Let's hear it for ME!</i>

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:17.274
(man)
Thank you for coming,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:09:17.274 --> 00:09:19.441
Please don't forget
your belongings.

00:09:19.441 --> 00:09:21.141
<i>Have a nice day.</i>

00:09:21.141 --> 00:09:22.208
<i>What?</i>

00:09:22.208 --> 00:09:24.208
It's because I don't
like cats, isn't it?

00:09:24.208 --> 00:09:26.208
This cup's
all about friendship!

00:09:26.208 --> 00:09:27.074
<i>Please!</i>

00:09:28.174 --> 00:09:29.674
You gotta be
kidding me.

00:09:29.674 --> 00:09:31.408
Today wasn't
about friendship.

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:33.208
Friends don't punish
losing duelists

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:34.974
by sending them
to the underground.

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.774
That's not what
dueling's about!

00:09:36.774 --> 00:09:40.274
Dueling's about putting on a
good show and having a fun time!

00:09:40.274 --> 00:09:42.574
At least,
it used to be.

00:09:42.574 --> 00:09:44.074
But not around
here.

00:09:44.074 --> 00:09:45.741
But what can I do?

00:09:45.741 --> 00:09:48.108
It's not like
I can walk away.

00:09:48.108 --> 00:09:49.541
And if I don't win
my duels,

00:09:49.541 --> 00:09:51.274
then I'm gonna be
sent down there too

00:09:51.274 --> 00:09:54.641
just like Gong and
Chojiro and now Tony!

00:09:54.641 --> 00:09:56.474
Argh!

00:09:56.474 --> 00:09:59.674
And nothing I do or say
will bring my friends back!

00:09:59.674 --> 00:10:03.274
This is just the way things are
around here.

00:10:03.274 --> 00:10:05.874
The boy's so concerned
with his friends!

00:10:05.874 --> 00:10:08.074
What he should be
concerned with is dueling.

00:10:08.074 --> 00:10:09.841
If he duels the way
he fought Jack,

00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:11.941
he will lose his
next challenge.

00:10:11.941 --> 00:10:15.241
Yes, in fact all the challenges
that lay ahead are formidable.

00:10:15.241 --> 00:10:16.774
Wouldn't you agree, Declan?

00:10:16.774 --> 00:10:19.074
Obviously, but I would say
that after today,

00:10:19.074 --> 00:10:21.808
there is more cause
for optimism than concern.

00:10:21.808 --> 00:10:25.608
After all, our duelists have
shown a great deal of promise.

00:10:25.608 --> 00:10:27.974
I'm not so sure that I agree
with that sentiment.

00:10:27.974 --> 00:10:30.774
True, your Lancers
won two matches

00:10:30.774 --> 00:10:33.108
but they also suffered
two defeats.

00:10:33.108 --> 00:10:36.108
You're hardly convincing us
of your Lancers' abilities.

00:10:36.108 --> 00:10:37.774
Correct, Presider?

00:10:37.774 --> 00:10:39.008
Who knows?

00:10:39.008 --> 00:10:42.474
We'll just have to see how
things unfold tomorrow.

00:10:42.474 --> 00:10:43.741
If that's all then,

00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:46.774
we'll take our leave
of you now.

00:10:46.774 --> 00:10:49.174
What?
Leaving so soon?

00:10:49.174 --> 00:10:53.174
But we still have so many
pressing matters to discuss.

00:10:53.174 --> 00:10:57.474
Please, Declan, stay just
a bit longer, won't you?

00:10:57.474 --> 00:10:58.941
Join us for a meal

00:10:58.941 --> 00:11:02.174
and break bread with
our very special guest.

00:11:02.174 --> 00:11:03.408
Blast it!

00:11:03.408 --> 00:11:05.508
I've gone and
ruined the surprise.

00:11:05.508 --> 00:11:06.774
(Declan)
What guest?

00:11:06.774 --> 00:11:10.208
Oh, just one of
the very best duelists alive.

00:11:10.208 --> 00:11:13.541
Someone who made your Lancer
look like a novice.

00:11:13.541 --> 00:11:17.641
Why, I'm not even sure
he wasn't taking it easy on him.

00:11:17.641 --> 00:11:21.108
Presenting the one,
the only...

00:11:21.108 --> 00:11:25.008
The Master of Faster!

00:11:25.008 --> 00:11:27.708
Jack Atlas!

00:11:36.494 --> 00:11:37.627
I don't get it.

00:11:37.627 --> 00:11:40.827
I'm a headliner,
a box office draw‐‐ I'm Sylvio!

00:11:40.827 --> 00:11:42.460
So why wasn't I picked
to duel

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.194
on the first day
of the tournament?

00:11:44.194 --> 00:11:47.460
I'd have put on a better show
than the clowns they chose!

00:11:47.460 --> 00:11:50.594
Don't you know
how to treat your stars?

00:11:50.594 --> 00:11:52.094
No, you don't!

00:11:52.094 --> 00:11:54.294
And mark my words!

00:11:54.294 --> 00:11:55.694
You can't make it up
to me.

00:11:55.694 --> 00:11:57.694
I'll hold
this grudge for life!

00:11:57.694 --> 00:11:59.894
For all eternity!
Ha!

00:11:59.894 --> 00:12:01.127
(bell chiming)

00:12:01.127 --> 00:12:02.960
Huh?

00:12:09.594 --> 00:12:11.227
(gulping)

00:12:11.227 --> 00:12:13.694
Then again, I understand that
mistakes can be made

00:12:13.694 --> 00:12:15.727
every once
in a while.

00:12:15.727 --> 00:12:17.460
Ahhh...

00:12:19.494 --> 00:12:21.094
So I'll forgive you
this one time

00:12:21.094 --> 00:12:23.960
and eat this delicious meal
just to be polite, got it?

00:12:25.894 --> 00:12:28.127
So... good!

00:12:28.127 --> 00:12:30.994
And each bite
gets better!

00:12:30.994 --> 00:12:32.060
Yum!

00:12:34.494 --> 00:12:36.527
That's to say,
when I remember to chew

00:12:36.527 --> 00:12:38.660
and not just swallow
the whole thing down,

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:41.194
but that doesn't happen
very often.

00:12:47.327 --> 00:12:49.427
I don't know
what's wrong with me.

00:12:49.427 --> 00:12:51.160
I should be happy.

00:12:54.294 --> 00:12:55.727
But...

00:12:55.727 --> 00:12:58.027
Even with all of this food and
scoring a win today,

00:12:58.027 --> 00:13:00.060
I'm simply not.

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.960
I guess deep down
I'm still worried about Yuya.

00:13:11.994 --> 00:13:13.094
It's funny.

00:13:13.094 --> 00:13:15.394
In a duel,
I always know what to do.

00:13:15.394 --> 00:13:17.627
But in life,
not so much.

00:13:21.194 --> 00:13:23.260
Zuzu and Chojiro
gave it their all

00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.894
to get me out of my funk
when I lost to Jack...

00:13:26.894 --> 00:13:29.994
Your performance was abysmal,
mediocre at best.

00:13:29.994 --> 00:13:32.960
And I'm gonna bring the curtain
down on you!

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:34.360
Boy.

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:37.327
Some harsh words, but not as
harsh as what happened next...

00:13:37.327 --> 00:13:39.127
I'll never forget it.

00:13:39.127 --> 00:13:40.360
I mean,
how could I?

00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.594
It was awful.

00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:45.460
I was trying to put on
a show

00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:48.060
but instead
I got put in my place.

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.094
But even so, there just has to
be a lesson in there somewhere.

00:13:57.694 --> 00:13:59.527
Just wish I knew what it was.

00:13:59.527 --> 00:14:01.427
Guess
that's my duel today...

00:14:01.427 --> 00:14:04.860
Facing this loss and finding
peace with it,

00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:09.394
getting back to being myself
and making my dad proud.

00:14:09.394 --> 00:14:11.027
I just hope
I have it in me!

00:14:13.994 --> 00:14:15.294
So Jack, you're saying

00:14:15.294 --> 00:14:17.960
of all the duelists that
appeared during the first day,

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.427
Zuzu Boyle was the best?

00:14:20.427 --> 00:14:22.127
That's not what
I'm saying at all.

00:14:22.127 --> 00:14:25.127
I'm saying that she had grit and
that's what matters the most.

00:14:25.127 --> 00:14:26.260
(woman)
Grit?

00:14:26.260 --> 00:14:28.927
How does that make one
a better duelist?

00:14:28.927 --> 00:14:32.060
(Jack)
Grit means even if you're not
the best, you can beat the best.

00:14:32.060 --> 00:14:33.960
It's not a trait
you can learn.

00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:36.727
It's something that you find,
if you're lucky.

00:14:36.727 --> 00:14:40.460
So then what you're saying is
that it all comes down to luck.

00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:42.327
(Jack, scoffing)
Well, in my experience,

00:14:42.327 --> 00:14:45.427
luck is only good
if it doesn't run out.

00:14:45.427 --> 00:14:48.460
It's too bad those runners
don't come with training wheels.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:51.860
I would've enjoyed watching
the pipsqueak participate.

00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:53.494
(Declan)
Riley was going to,

00:14:53.494 --> 00:14:57.594
but circumstances forced me
to make other arrangements.

00:14:57.594 --> 00:15:00.360
The ninja Moon Shadow
dueled in Riley's place,

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:04.494
an interesting decision but I'm
quite sure you had your reasons.

00:15:07.327 --> 00:15:08.327
Too bad.

00:15:08.327 --> 00:15:09.827
Riley
has the gift.

00:15:09.827 --> 00:15:11.360
The gift of grit.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:12.427
Huh?

00:15:12.427 --> 00:15:14.327
What are you
talking about, Jack?

00:15:14.327 --> 00:15:15.460
How would you know?

00:15:15.460 --> 00:15:18.660
Because I can see it deep
in Riley's eyes.

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:22.094
The little one has
the same look I once did.

00:15:26.194 --> 00:15:28.960
You see, I wasn't always
the Master of Faster.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:32.060
There was a time
when I was cold and lonely.

00:15:32.060 --> 00:15:34.994
I was about the age
Riley is now.

00:15:34.994 --> 00:15:36.294
So it's true.

00:15:36.294 --> 00:15:38.627
I have heard stories
you were once a Common

00:15:38.627 --> 00:15:40.294
but I never knew
for sure.

00:15:40.294 --> 00:15:42.427
Well, now you do,
Declan.

00:15:42.427 --> 00:15:43.860
And being born
in the slums

00:15:43.860 --> 00:15:46.727
gave me the opportunity
to find something precious:

00:15:46.727 --> 00:15:48.594
The grit I mentioned
before.

00:15:48.594 --> 00:15:49.560
That's what
gave me the strength

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.660
to fight my way out
of that place.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:55.060
And I see that same grit
in little Riley's eyes.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:56.327
Tell me, Declan,

00:15:56.327 --> 00:15:59.394
did Riley grow up
in conditions similar to mine?

00:15:59.394 --> 00:16:01.594
(Declan)
That's why
you're the master.

00:16:01.594 --> 00:16:04.960
Absolutely nothing escapes
your perceptive gaze.

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.994
(Presider)
Is that right?

00:16:06.994 --> 00:16:11.260
Hmm, and all this time I thought
Riley was your younger brother.

00:16:12.494 --> 00:16:14.227
(Declan)
So tell me, Mr. Atlas.

00:16:14.227 --> 00:16:16.760
What motivated you to take
the necessary steps

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.760
to rise up from
the Commons?

00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:21.160
I'm sure Riley
is eager to know.

00:16:25.927 --> 00:16:29.760
It is a tale about how chance
fate changed my life forever!

00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:41.360
My desire to rise up
came from a single card.

00:16:46.994 --> 00:16:50.260
You could say that the winds
of fate brought it to me.

00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:53.294
Or it might've been just
a random act of chance.

00:16:53.294 --> 00:16:55.727
But whatever it was,
what matters is,

00:16:55.727 --> 00:16:58.127
this card entered
my life.

00:16:58.127 --> 00:17:01.627
And I could immediately sense
that it was special.

00:17:01.627 --> 00:17:03.894
Not necessarily
for what it was,

00:17:03.894 --> 00:17:05.660
but for where
it came from,

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:08.560
high in the sky,
above the Commons.

00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:10.627
There was no question
in my mind:

00:17:10.627 --> 00:17:12.460
the card came
from the Tops.

00:17:12.460 --> 00:17:15.627
Did someone accidentally drop
it or simply throw it away?

00:17:15.627 --> 00:17:16.927
<i>I didn't know.</i>

00:17:16.927 --> 00:17:20.194
But I knew it was meant
to play a role in my life.

00:17:20.194 --> 00:17:23.294
So I studied the card
with great care.

00:17:23.294 --> 00:17:24.894
NNHowever, it was
quite ordinary.

00:17:24.894 --> 00:17:27.594
Not exceptionally powerful
or especially rare,

00:17:27.594 --> 00:17:30.794
and that's when it struck me,
like a lightning bolt

00:17:30.794 --> 00:17:33.560
more supercharged
than any Duel Runner.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:36.927
I felt this card wasn't
necessarily for me to use,

00:17:36.927 --> 00:17:38.527
<i>but for me to return.</i>

00:17:38.527 --> 00:17:41.327
Back to the sky,
to the Tops.

00:17:41.327 --> 00:17:44.160
In a way, it was like
a ticket to a better life,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:47.427
NNbut I would have to do my
partin order to redeem it,

00:17:47.427 --> 00:17:49.627
so I slowly began
to hatch a plan

00:17:49.627 --> 00:17:52.194
on how
I would do exactly that.

00:17:52.194 --> 00:17:55.460
NNI would become the best
duelistto ever battle.

00:17:55.460 --> 00:17:57.727
NNThe strongest in all the land!

00:17:57.727 --> 00:17:58.994
<i>And so I did.</i>

00:17:58.994 --> 00:18:02.160
<i>And earned my place here.</i>

00:18:02.160 --> 00:18:05.527
But I'm not the only one
who's not from around here.

00:18:05.527 --> 00:18:08.327
I've been told the two of you
are from a whole other world

00:18:08.327 --> 00:18:10.060
and are
on your own quest.

00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:14.194
If so, allow me to give you
just one piece of advice:

00:18:14.194 --> 00:18:15.360
Be gritty!

00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.294
Huh?

00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:19.460
If you've got the stuff, kid,

00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:21.794
then don't be afraid
to use it.

00:18:21.794 --> 00:18:23.160
'Cause when you do,

00:18:23.160 --> 00:18:26.494
there won't be anybody
who'll be able to stop you.

00:18:26.494 --> 00:18:27.894
Oh...

00:18:29.094 --> 00:18:30.360
(Declan)
I hope you're right,

00:18:30.360 --> 00:18:32.394
because the forces
we're going up against

00:18:32.394 --> 00:18:34.294
are powerful
indeed...

00:18:34.294 --> 00:18:37.560
And we'll need all the help
we can get.

00:18:42.727 --> 00:18:46.260
Pardon me, sir, but
I have a letter for you.

00:18:52.560 --> 00:18:54.894
Why, this is from
the Director himself!

00:18:54.894 --> 00:18:56.760
<i>Greetings, Officer 227.</i>

00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:58.460
<i>I have good news.</i>

00:18:58.460 --> 00:19:01.327
I plan on
temporarily reinstating you

00:19:01.327 --> 00:19:03.894
to your former position
as Duel Chaser.

00:19:03.894 --> 00:19:06.760
The job you so cherished will
be yours again.

00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.094
Of course, there's one
itty‐bitty string attached:

00:19:10.094 --> 00:19:11.927
by accepting your
old position,

00:19:11.927 --> 00:19:14.594
you also accept
to duel tomorrow.

00:19:14.594 --> 00:19:17.427
Your opponent will be
Yuya Sakaki.

00:19:17.427 --> 00:19:19.327
I know,
you wish it was Yugo,

00:19:19.327 --> 00:19:23.260
NNthe duelist who humiliated
you in your last pursuit.

00:19:23.260 --> 00:19:25.460
But I want Yuya
taken down.

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:27.394
And if you're able
to do this,

00:19:27.394 --> 00:19:31.727
I'll make your temporary
reinstatement permanent.

00:19:31.727 --> 00:19:35.060
Yes!
I knew that this day would come!

00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:37.894
I knew the Director would give
me a second chance!

00:19:37.894 --> 00:19:39.827
(laughing)

00:19:39.827 --> 00:19:41.360
After serving my punishment,
of course.

00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:43.527
It's been
the worst experience of my life.

00:19:43.527 --> 00:19:45.927
Kicked off the force,
banished down to the Commons,

00:19:45.927 --> 00:19:48.594
pursued by the same people
I used to work for.

00:19:48.594 --> 00:19:51.060
Being treated like
one of the lowly, no‐good punks

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.427
that I used to chase!

00:19:52.427 --> 00:19:54.827
I wondered
why they locked me up here!

00:19:54.827 --> 00:19:56.794
But now it all
makes sense!

00:19:56.794 --> 00:19:59.927
The Director wanted me
where he could find me,

00:19:59.927 --> 00:20:02.794
where I could once again prove
my worth!

00:20:11.294 --> 00:20:13.327
Oh,
and I will prove it.

00:20:13.327 --> 00:20:16.394
I will come at this Yuya with
everything that I am

00:20:16.394 --> 00:20:18.394
and earn
back my badge!

00:20:18.394 --> 00:20:20.227
And with this card
in my deck,

00:20:20.227 --> 00:20:22.894
the long arm of the law
will grab victory!

00:20:22.894 --> 00:20:25.360
(laughing)

00:20:38.427 --> 00:20:39.560
Dad...

00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.094
This was your card.

00:20:41.094 --> 00:20:42.294
When Mom gave it to me,

00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:44.160
she said you thought
that one day

00:20:44.160 --> 00:20:47.227
I might need a little help
to get my smile back.

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:48.694
Boy, were you right.

00:20:48.694 --> 00:20:50.127
I wish you were here...

00:20:50.127 --> 00:20:53.627
You always knew the right thing
to say.

00:20:53.627 --> 00:20:55.560
(Dad) Take your
dad's advice, Yuya.

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:58.194
Try to laugh when you feel
like crying.

00:20:58.194 --> 00:21:02.627
And when things get tough,
respond with a smile.

00:21:02.627 --> 00:21:07.260
It will give you the strength
to keep moving forward!

00:21:07.260 --> 00:21:09.860
It's kind of
like a pendulum.

00:21:09.860 --> 00:21:11.827
If the pendulum
swings one way,

00:21:11.827 --> 00:21:14.394
you know it will swing
the other way, too.

00:21:14.394 --> 00:21:15.994
<i>Like in a duel!</i>

00:21:15.994 --> 00:21:18.494
The key to dueling is to
believe in your deck...

00:21:18.494 --> 00:21:20.094
<i>and yourself.</i>

00:21:20.094 --> 00:21:21.294
When you're
falling behind,

00:21:21.294 --> 00:21:23.960
you can always make things
swing your way again.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:25.827
So don't worry
about anything.

00:21:25.827 --> 00:21:28.327
Just try to enjoy
the ride.

00:21:28.327 --> 00:21:30.994
Try to remember
what I've told you, Yuya.

00:21:30.994 --> 00:21:33.160
<i>It may help you someday.</i>

00:21:36.094 --> 00:21:37.260
You're right, Dad.

00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.494
It's time I make things
swing my way again.

00:21:39.494 --> 00:21:42.360
So that's
just what I plan on doing.

00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:44.860
I'll rise above
my fears!

00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:46.360
My doubts!

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:50.127
And remind people that dueling's
about having fun!

00:21:50.127 --> 00:21:52.860
Because I'm Yuya Sakaki!

00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:54.794
And it's showtime!

00:23:05.694 --> 00:23:07.760
