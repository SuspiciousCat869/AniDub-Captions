every single Topsider a lesson!

They report that there are
no signs of Obelisk Force
anywhere.

Have they retreated?
Hmm.

00:00:54.266 --> 00:00:56.500
Perhaps they gave up
now that I have

So Sergey the psycho
swiped Zuzu!?

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.133
And Celina was taken back

00:03:31.133 --> 00:03:32.466

00:03:32.466 --> 00:03:34.933
Yuyaaaa!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.500
I swore to protect them,
but I couldn't.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.300
Back up. Why did Sergey
take off with Zuzu?

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.166
Roget. Roget used to work
with Duel Academy.

00:03:47.166 --> 00:03:49.833
But then,
he turned against them.

00:03:49.833 --> 00:03:52.666
He wants to rule this City,
and he's gonna use Zuzu

00:03:52.666 --> 00:03:55.833
to make sure Duel Academy
doesn't get in the way of
that.

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:57.966
So he's plannin'
to use Zuzu

00:03:57.966 --> 00:03:59.866
as some sort of
bargainin' chip?

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.133
No chance.
Huh?

00:04:04.233 --> 00:04:05.666
I'm busting her out!

00:04:05.666 --> 00:04:08.566
Wait for me, Sora!
I'm coming with you!

00:04:08.566 --> 00:04:10.366
You must rest.
I'll go.

00:04:10.366 --> 00:04:13.500
Sorry, ninja man, but you
need a timeout as well.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:14.333
Ninja need no rest.

00:04:14.333 --> 00:04:16.333
You're not
going anywhere!

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.966
I still don't
trust you, bub!

00:04:18.966 --> 00:04:20.900
Sylvio!

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.633
Yuya already said
he's on our side.

00:04:23.633 --> 00:04:25.366
That's good enough for Gong.

00:04:27.766 --> 00:04:29.166
(Sylvio)
Rude.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.400
Wait up! Agh! Uhh.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:35.266
Buddy.

00:04:39.366 --> 00:04:41.900

Mobs of Commons are heading
toward the center of the city.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.266
Instruct all units
to initiate anti‐riot protocols

00:04:45.266 --> 00:04:46.633
at the Duel Palace.

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:48.633
Tell them to open
all stadium gates

00:04:48.633 --> 00:04:51.833
and allow any fleeing Topsiders
to enter.

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:55.433
But absolutely no Commons
can be allowed inside.

00:04:55.433 --> 00:04:56.566
(woman)
<i>Acknowledged.</i>

00:04:56.566 --> 00:04:59.300
And inform the Duel Palace
control center.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.800
The Friendship Cup
will continue,

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.800
with a special guest
competitor.

00:05:08.166 --> 00:05:09.700
♪

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:12.033

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.166

00:05:21.166 --> 00:05:22.766

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:24.100

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.300
Howdy, friends and neighbors!

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.466
We're all set to hurtle
into more turbo duelin' action

00:05:28.466 --> 00:05:31.066
here at the Friendship Cup!

00:05:31.066 --> 00:05:34.033
Apparently,
there's a bit of a ruckus

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:35.700
outside the stadium.

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.100
Thanks to the friendly folks

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:39.466
who work
for Sector Security, though,

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:43.000
in here we can enjoy the duel
safe and cozy!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.833
But, before we get underway,

00:05:44.833 --> 00:05:48.766
there's a surprise that's
sure to tickle y'all pink!

00:05:48.766 --> 00:05:50.566
How can they keep
the tournament goin'

00:05:50.566 --> 00:05:52.933
while the city's
a disaster?

00:05:52.933 --> 00:05:54.933
Originally, Sergey was set
to face off against Yugo,

00:05:54.933 --> 00:05:58.533
but due to extenuatin'
circumstances,

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.800
Yugo had to pull out
of the competition.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:03.700
Which means there's gonna
be a change in today's
matchup.

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:05.933
So who's dueling?

00:06:05.933 --> 00:06:07.666
<i>Don't fret, though,</i>

00:06:07.666 --> 00:06:10.200
'cause we replaced Yugo
with the city's number one
hero!

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.666
It's the Master of Faster
himself, Jack Atlas!

00:06:14.666 --> 00:06:16.000
(gasps)

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:19.566
Huh? Jack's dueling?!

00:06:19.566 --> 00:06:20.833
(crowd chattering)

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:22.033
Goodness me!

00:06:22.033 --> 00:06:23.766
Everyone is in the City
will want to see this!

00:06:23.766 --> 00:06:24.966
I simply adore Jack!

00:06:24.966 --> 00:06:28.300
Folks, this duel's
gonna be humdinger!

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.566
My apologies for announcing
your participation

00:06:30.566 --> 00:06:33.166
before I had a chance
to consult with you.

00:06:33.166 --> 00:06:34.266
(Jack)
No sweat. I'm always
ready and willing

00:06:34.266 --> 00:06:37.233
<i>to get back on the track.</i>

00:06:37.233 --> 00:06:39.666
This won't take long.

00:06:39.666 --> 00:06:42.033
Best of luck.

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:43.700
Hmm.
(beep)

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:47.633
Ah, welcome, Zuzu.

00:06:47.633 --> 00:06:50.833
You're just in time to see
the next duel get underway.

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:52.900
I'm not interested
in watching any duel.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:54.466
Don't you know what's
going on in the City?

00:06:54.466 --> 00:06:56.466
Yes, I know
about the unrest,

00:06:56.466 --> 00:06:58.933
but they'll calm down
soon enough.

00:06:58.933 --> 00:07:00.266
Huh?

00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:02.066
Once the Turbo Duel
between Sergey

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:04.100
and Jack Atlas
has been settled.

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.100
Why is that?

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:07.633
Jack Atlas is the hope
for the Commons

00:07:07.633 --> 00:07:09.566
and the Topsiders alike.

00:07:09.566 --> 00:07:13.266
But when Sergey defeats
Jack, their hero will fall...

00:07:13.266 --> 00:07:15.933
and as all the inhabitants
of New Domino City

00:07:15.933 --> 00:07:18.033
sink into complete despair,

00:07:18.033 --> 00:07:22.933
they will be looking for a new
leader to guide them... me.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:25.466
It will mark
a new beginning
for this city

00:07:25.466 --> 00:07:27.466
and the entire
Synchro Dimension.

00:07:27.466 --> 00:07:28.700
(gasps)

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.900
Mr. Atlas...
do you remember me?

00:07:41.066 --> 00:07:44.500
I... I told you
I was a huge fan,

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.600
and you gave me
one of your cards.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.566
You said it
was perfect for me.

00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:50.933
When I saw what it was,
I thought you were being mean

00:07:50.933 --> 00:07:53.033
'cause it looked super weak.

00:07:53.033 --> 00:07:54.800
So when I found out Yuya
was gonna duel you,

00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:57.366
I gave it to him.

00:07:57.366 --> 00:07:58.800
I was hoping he'd crush you

00:07:58.800 --> 00:08:01.500
and give the card back to you
and tell you how mean you are.

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:04.833
My, my, that's
quite the plan.

00:08:04.833 --> 00:08:06.033
Yeah.

00:08:06.033 --> 00:08:08.433
But Yuya helped
change my tune.

00:08:08.433 --> 00:08:10.633
It turned out that
Tuning Magician was amazing.

00:08:10.633 --> 00:08:13.733
I saw there's no such thing
as a worthless card.

00:08:13.733 --> 00:08:15.233
Each one has a purpose.

00:08:15.233 --> 00:08:18.700
You just have to find out
what that is.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:20.600
It's the same with people.

00:08:21.733 --> 00:08:23.566
You have your purpose.

00:08:23.566 --> 00:08:25.333
Now it's just a question
of what you do with it.

00:08:25.333 --> 00:08:28.500
You'll tell Yuya
the same thing
for me, right?

00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.333
Yeah...

00:08:30.333 --> 00:08:34.366
Looks like the first one out
of the tunnel is Sergey,

00:08:34.366 --> 00:08:37.266
a dangerous duelist who's
as testy as a crocodile!

00:08:37.266 --> 00:08:39.733
Question is,
can he sink his teeth

00:08:39.733 --> 00:08:43.766
into New Domino's Champion
and wrestle away a victory?

00:08:43.766 --> 00:08:45.233
<i>It's time to find out,</i>

00:08:45.233 --> 00:08:47.400
so please welcome
your favorite duelist,

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:52.366
and mine, the one and only,
true legend...

00:08:52.366 --> 00:08:54.066
<i>Jack Atlas!</i>

00:08:59.133 --> 00:09:00.833
(jets rumbling)

00:09:04.866 --> 00:09:06.800
(Jack) Who's the one
Master of Faster?

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.233
Who rules the duels?

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:09.400
That's right, it's me!

00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:11.866
We adore you,
Jack Atlas!

00:09:11.866 --> 00:09:14.033
That's right,
cheer your hero on.

00:09:14.033 --> 00:09:18.166
Raise your hopes high,
so that I can crush them.

00:09:18.166 --> 00:09:21.433
And then replace
your hero with a new one!

00:09:21.433 --> 00:09:23.066
You are no hero!

00:09:23.066 --> 00:09:25.966
Time will prove
you wrong, my dear.

00:09:25.966 --> 00:09:27.400
Jack will fall today,

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.866
and soon all will rise
to be my loyal subjects.

00:09:30.866 --> 00:09:32.100

<i>Whoo, hey!</i>

00:09:39.166 --> 00:09:41.333
This matchup caught us

00:09:41.333 --> 00:09:43.700

just the pick‐me‐up

Let's duel!

00:10:06.766 --> 00:10:09.100
(Melissa)
Jack Atlas made it
out of the gate first,

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:11.166
so he'll take
the openin' turn!

00:10:11.166 --> 00:10:12.633
It's my move!

00:10:12.633 --> 00:10:14.300
I'll kick things
into overdrive

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:16.733
with my red hot
Red Resonator!

00:10:16.733 --> 00:10:19.900
But I'm not done
heating things up!

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.100
I can also summon
this Red Warg from my hand

00:10:23.100 --> 00:10:25.300
by trimming its
attack points in half.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:30.200
To add fuel to the fire,

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.833
Level 2 Red Resonator
will tune Level 6 Red Warg!

00:10:33.833 --> 00:10:37.233
Now from the ancient chasms
of a lost world

00:10:37.233 --> 00:10:42.800
I awake a great
and terrible power.

00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:44.733
I Synchro Summon!

00:10:44.733 --> 00:10:48.000
Now rise Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend!

00:10:50.766 --> 00:10:52.400
(Melissa)
<i>Take it from me, folks!</i>

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.300
That Dragon's got
one fiery disposition!

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:59.466
I'll place one card
facedown, ending my turn.

00:10:59.466 --> 00:11:01.500
(Melissa) Jack's off
to a quick start!

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.966
Yes, and a quick finish.

00:11:03.966 --> 00:11:05.433
My turn!

00:11:05.433 --> 00:11:08.166
Current optimal
duel action is summoning

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:10.933
Earthbound Prisoner Stone
Sweeper to lay groundwork

00:11:10.933 --> 00:11:12.500
for victory conditions.

00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.100
(roaring)

00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.300
For next move I will summon

00:11:18.300 --> 00:11:21.500
Tuner Monster Earthbound
Prisoner Line Walker.

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.033
Protocol now requires me

00:11:27.033 --> 00:11:31.133
to activate spell card
Harmonic Synchro Fusion!

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:32.933
I use two monsters on field

00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:36.133
to Synchro Summon
and Fusion Summon!

00:11:38.833 --> 00:11:40.766
(Melissa)
<i>What a steal!</i>

00:11:40.766 --> 00:11:43.300
That's like conjurin' up
two different summons

00:11:43.300 --> 00:11:45.333
<i>for the price of one!</i>

00:11:45.333 --> 00:11:49.066
Initiating Synchro Summon
as primary action.

00:11:49.066 --> 00:11:51.533
Level 3 Earthbound
Prisoner Line Walker

00:11:51.533 --> 00:11:55.700
tunes Level 5 Earthbound
Prisoner Stone Sweeper.

00:11:57.733 --> 00:11:59.700
I Synchro Summon!

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.233
Earthbound Servant Geo Gryphon!

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:09.633
(roaring)

00:12:09.633 --> 00:12:14.166
Initiating Fusion Summon
as secondary action in protocol.

00:12:14.166 --> 00:12:18.433
These two Earthbound Prisoners
assimilate into one!

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:25.233
I Fusion Summon!

00:12:25.233 --> 00:12:28.400
Earthbound Servant Geo Kraken!

00:12:31.033 --> 00:12:34.666
(Melissa)
A Synchro Monster
and a Fusion Monster!

00:12:34.666 --> 00:12:37.900
Sergey's pullin' out
all the stops!

00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:40.233
Initiating
victory protocol delta.

00:12:40.233 --> 00:12:45.500
By banishing Earthbound
Prisoner Line Walker
from my graveyard,

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:49.100
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend
is considered resummoned.

00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:52.233
Why resummon somethin'
that's already summoned?

00:12:52.233 --> 00:12:53.900
I'm flummoxed!

00:12:53.900 --> 00:12:56.866
Scarlight Red Dragon Archfiend's
resummoning

00:12:56.866 --> 00:12:59.933
triggers Geo Kraken's
special ability.

00:12:59.933 --> 00:13:02.866
Your Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend is destroyed,

00:13:02.866 --> 00:13:06.833
and you take 800 points
of damage.

00:13:06.833 --> 00:13:08.533
Well, pack my mule!

00:13:08.533 --> 00:13:12.000
Seems the only reason Sergey
resummoned Jack Atlas's Dragon

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.933
was so that Geo Kraken
could take a crack at him!

00:13:14.933 --> 00:13:17.466
And if Sergey attacks
with his monsters,

00:13:17.466 --> 00:13:20.633
Jack will be up
a creek without a canoe!

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:28.900
What disaster
for the master of faster.

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.233
Whoa! Jack's Dragon has survived
by some sort of miracle!

00:13:36.233 --> 00:13:37.766
(growling)

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:40.333
(Jack)
Actually, it was thanks

00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:42.166
to the Action Spell Detour.

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.833
It negates
your monster's ability

00:13:43.833 --> 00:13:46.933
and damages you
by 500 points!

00:13:46.933 --> 00:13:49.466
(grunts)

00:13:49.466 --> 00:13:52.800
(Melissa)
Instead of takin' damage,
Jack dealt it back!

00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:54.100
That there's
a prime example

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:57.533
of turnin' the tables
on your adversary!

00:13:57.533 --> 00:13:59.300
Good.

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.066
Give the people
of New Domino City hope.

00:14:02.066 --> 00:14:04.833
They'll feel even more
anguished when you lose.

00:14:04.833 --> 00:14:09.433
I place one card facedown
and end my turn.

00:14:09.433 --> 00:14:11.333
Great battle!
What a twist!

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:13.233
And Jack does it again!

00:14:13.233 --> 00:14:16.300
Huh! Findin' an Action card
was just dumb luck.

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:18.333
(grunting)

00:14:18.333 --> 00:14:20.666
Yuya, you must rest.

00:14:20.666 --> 00:14:23.766
I can't just sit around
and do nothing.

00:14:23.766 --> 00:14:27.000
I'll rest later.
Now's the time for action.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.466
I gotta help rescue Zuzu.

00:14:29.466 --> 00:14:32.233
Hmm. Then I won't
try to stop you.

00:14:32.233 --> 00:14:35.066
And Gong's gonna tag along
to back you up!

00:14:35.066 --> 00:14:36.300
Huh?

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.000
Please don't go!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.000
Riley!

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:41.133
I don't wanna
be left alone!

00:14:41.133 --> 00:14:42.533
You don't
have to worry,

00:14:42.533 --> 00:14:45.433
because Chojiro and Sylvio
will look after you.

00:14:45.433 --> 00:14:47.666
Me? I'm no
babysitter!

00:14:47.666 --> 00:14:50.000
I know you'll take
good care of Riley.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.233
Sure.
Hold it, buster!

00:14:52.233 --> 00:14:53.666
Why do I have
to stay back!

00:14:53.666 --> 00:14:54.866
Because.

00:14:54.866 --> 00:14:57.466
I know it's because
you want all the glory!

00:14:57.466 --> 00:14:59.166
No.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:01.600
It's because taking care
of Riley is important.

00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:03.166
Yuya's right.

00:15:03.166 --> 00:15:05.166
Oh, so you're
on his side!

00:15:05.166 --> 00:15:06.933
Let me remind you that Riley

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:10.500
is related to the leader
of the Lancers Declan Akaba.

00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:14.100
Only our best warrior can be
trusted to care for him.

00:15:14.100 --> 00:15:17.600
You wouldn't want
to disappoint him, would you?

00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.500
Aaaagh!

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.166
That's right,
I wouldn't really
be a babysitter,

00:15:22.166 --> 00:15:24.833
but more like
a top‐level babyguard.

00:15:24.833 --> 00:15:27.133
Yeah sure, that's
one way to look at it.

00:15:27.133 --> 00:15:29.166
Well, in that case,

00:15:29.166 --> 00:15:33.100
since I am the best warrior,
I'll have to say, yeah!

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.000
Thank you.
Good luck!

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.266
Yuya!

00:15:38.266 --> 00:15:39.666
Do not fret.

00:15:39.666 --> 00:15:41.733
We will keep you safe,
my friend.

00:15:41.733 --> 00:15:43.766
Relax‐‐
if bad guys show up,

00:15:43.766 --> 00:15:46.500
your life will
be completely
dependent on me!

00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:49.900
In that case, I suppose we
can always try to run for it.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:50.833
Grrr.

00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:55.366
Here I go!

00:15:55.366 --> 00:15:58.700
Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend's heating things up!

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.466
It allows me to destroy
all your monsters,

00:16:01.466 --> 00:16:04.033
and then you take
500 points of damage

00:16:04.033 --> 00:16:06.733
for each one
that perished by its flames!

00:16:06.733 --> 00:16:09.600
Prepare to feel the heat!

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.733
Ruthless Inferno!

00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:23.733
(growls)

00:16:23.733 --> 00:16:25.533
(electronic bleeping)

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.766
Sergey couldn't activate
that Action Card

00:16:33.766 --> 00:16:35.366
in time to protect himself.

00:16:35.366 --> 00:16:41.333
When Geo Gryphon is destroyed,
your monster is also destroyed.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:45.700
I send Red Gardna to
the graveyard to counter that.

00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.633
Its special ability
protects my monster

00:16:48.633 --> 00:16:51.766
from being destroyed by
any special abilities this turn!

00:16:51.766 --> 00:16:55.766
(Melissa)
Sergey went for a gut punch,
but Jack dodged the blow!

00:16:55.766 --> 00:16:57.766
(Jack)
Enough games!

00:16:57.766 --> 00:17:01.233
Let's see how you handle
the heat when Archfiend
attacks you directly!

00:17:01.233 --> 00:17:03.533
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.666
I activate the trap card
Earthbound Beginnings!

00:17:08.666 --> 00:17:12.900
It cuts the damage
I take in half.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:21.800
Then, I can activate
a Field Spell from my deck.

00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:25.666
I activate Earthbound Tundra!

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:33.866
This field lets me pick up
an extra Action Card

00:17:33.866 --> 00:17:35.500
when I have one in my hand.

00:17:35.500 --> 00:17:38.466
Whoa, that means double
the action for Sergey

00:17:38.466 --> 00:17:40.400
and double the danger
for Jack!

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.600
And by banishing
my Action Card,

00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:44.566
you take 300 points
of damage,

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:47.366
and your monster
loses 300 attack points.

00:17:47.366 --> 00:17:50.600
Sergey certainly thinks
he has the upper hand now.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:55.200
But he's wrong, because
his advantage is mine, too.

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.000
Since Earthbound Tundra
is a Field Spell,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.833
I can do the exact
same thing as Sergey,

00:17:59.833 --> 00:18:01.600
but, of course,
I'll do it better.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.400
(chuckling maniacally)

00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:06.600
Initiate Turbo Thruster Mode!

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.633
It's transformation time.

00:18:10.733 --> 00:18:12.000
(gasps)

00:18:15.833 --> 00:18:18.666
(screaming and groaning)

00:18:20.533 --> 00:18:21.800
(shrieking)

00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:23.666
What's happened to Sergey!?

00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:37.600
Aaagh!

00:18:47.133 --> 00:18:49.100
Aaaagh!

00:18:52.433 --> 00:18:53.433
Uhh!

00:18:53.433 --> 00:18:56.033
Thruster power up by 242%!

00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:01.500
I can now pick up all
Action Cards faster than Jack.

00:19:04.600 --> 00:19:05.933
Hope you have a warranty.

00:19:08.433 --> 00:19:09.700
I banish Action Card
to activate

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:12.900
Earthbound Tundra's
effect.

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:15.433
You take
300 points of damage

00:19:15.433 --> 00:19:17.733
and Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend

00:19:17.733 --> 00:19:20.000
loses 300 attack points!

00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.166
I've faced down a number
of whackadoos in my day,

00:19:23.166 --> 00:19:24.733
but you take the cake!

00:19:24.733 --> 00:19:28.333
(Sergey)
Scanning lane
for more Action Cards.

00:19:31.166 --> 00:19:34.200
All Action Cards
have been targeted,

00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:36.366
will retrieve each one.

00:19:36.366 --> 00:19:38.533
Excellent work, Sergey.

00:19:38.533 --> 00:19:42.600
The Master of Faster
will soon find himself deposed.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:46.200
Then Topsiders and Commons
will finally be united

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:48.300
in their
mutual despair!

00:19:48.300 --> 00:19:50.133
(crowd chattering)

00:19:50.133 --> 00:19:52.500
(Melissa)
I don't know about y'all,
but Sergey's new look

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:55.366
is givin' me a severe case
of the heebie‐jeebies!

00:19:55.366 --> 00:19:57.866
He's looking
more machine than man.

00:19:57.866 --> 00:19:59.100
<i>I mean, I've known people</i>

00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:00.966
who were attached
to their vehicles,

00:20:00.966 --> 00:20:02.566
<i>but this is ridiculous!</i>

00:20:02.566 --> 00:20:04.500
What have you
done to Sergey?

00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:08.766
I've transformed him into
the first Biocybernetic Duelist.

00:20:08.766 --> 00:20:10.533
Biocybernetic?

00:20:10.533 --> 00:20:11.733
(Roget)
By integrating
the latest biological

00:20:11.733 --> 00:20:14.400
and cybernetic technologies,

00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:16.900
I found a way to merge
duelist and vehicle,

00:20:16.900 --> 00:20:19.500
creating the ultimate
dueling machine.

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.533
When this duel is over,

00:20:21.533 --> 00:20:24.333
Jack Atlas will be sent
to the scrap heap.

00:20:32.100 --> 00:20:38.266
Thrust power increasing 175%,
elimination protocol activated.

00:20:38.266 --> 00:20:40.833
Finish off opponent
by any means!

00:20:40.833 --> 00:20:44.000
You can try,
but you won't succeed.

00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:45.933
If you believe
you can dethrone me,

00:20:45.933 --> 00:20:47.800
you're just
spinning your wheels!

00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:50.333
(Roget)
Oh, he will dethrone you Jack.

00:20:50.333 --> 00:20:53.500
There can only be one ruler
in this city.

00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:55.266
Before this day ends,

00:20:55.266 --> 00:20:58.100
all of New Domino City
will be bowing before me.

00:20:58.100 --> 00:21:01.433
There's no way that Jack's
gonna lose this duel,

00:21:01.433 --> 00:21:04.333
and there's no way that you're
gonna take over this city.

00:21:04.333 --> 00:21:07.166
Think again.
Jack will fall.

00:21:07.166 --> 00:21:08.866
And chaos will follow.

00:21:08.866 --> 00:21:11.300
The city will need
a strong leader,

00:21:11.300 --> 00:21:14.566
one who is willing
to rule with an iron fist.

00:21:14.566 --> 00:21:15.866
One such as me.

00:21:15.866 --> 00:21:18.000
(chuckling)

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:20.200
(laughing maniacally)

00:21:23.233 --> 00:21:26.233
