00:00:01.833 --> 00:00:03.966
Check out the rare
cards I snagged!

00:00:03.966 --> 00:00:05.566
Yeah, all of mine
are keepers, too!

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.966
Sylvio, have you spotted
Crow and the others yet?

00:00:11.966 --> 00:00:14.233
No, they're already
too far ahead of us.

00:00:14.233 --> 00:00:15.866
But don't you
sweat it.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.966
My uncanny sense of direction
will lead us out of here!

00:00:18.966 --> 00:00:22.900
I hope so, 'cause going back
isn't an option anymore.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.600
We must follow the path
of all great heroes.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.000
That means to press forward
no matter what the obstacles!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I owe it to those who put my
well‐being before their own.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.300
Onward then!

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.900
Your friend is depending
upon you to rescue her...

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.366
and we must not fail!

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:39.500
We won't!

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.333
I already found us
a way out of here!

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:42.466
See?

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:46.166
We're only a few inches
away from Freedomville!

00:00:46.166 --> 00:00:47.566
Am I great or what?

00:00:47.566 --> 00:00:50.600
Keep moving‐‐ I can't take
this view any longer.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.066
(crashing)
What?

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.433
You led us
to the roof!

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:59.833
I did think the air ducts were
sloping more up than down...

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:02.066
(man)
Stay where you are!
Don't move!

00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:04.666
(Tokumatsu)
We'll have to
battle our way out!

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:07.533
Good thing I picked up those
rare cards to bribe them with!

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:08.833
You can't.

00:01:08.833 --> 00:01:11.200
They aren't like the guards
in the cellblocks.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.700
These guys are
elite Stomptroopers.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.366
They're tough to the core
and can't be bribed!

00:01:17.366 --> 00:01:19.800
You have two
options prisoner slime:

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.066
Surrender now...

00:01:22.066 --> 00:01:24.466
or surrender later.

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:25.866
Thanks for
the warning...

00:01:25.866 --> 00:01:28.400
But I prefer to go
with option three!

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.433
Taking down you
clowns!

00:01:30.433 --> 00:01:32.266
(computer)
<i>Generating Action Field.</i>

00:01:32.266 --> 00:01:33.566
<i>Crossover.</i>

00:01:33.566 --> 00:01:35.100
There's a time and
place for everything,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.833
but this isn't the time and
it sure isn't the place!

00:01:37.833 --> 00:01:39.500
Battle Royal
mode engaged.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:43.300
(all)
Let's duel!

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.866
Big mistake,
kid!

00:01:44.866 --> 00:01:47.366
I summon Jutte Fighter,
front and center!

00:01:51.566 --> 00:01:54.266
And it's bringing
along some backup...

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:55.500
Fire Flint Lady!

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.633
I tune Level 2 Jutte Fighter
with Level 1 Fire Flint Lady!

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:08.433
Fools!

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:09.866
There is no
escape!

00:02:09.866 --> 00:02:12.500
Many have tried,
all have failed!

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.800
I Synchro Summon!

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.633
Level 3 Goyo Defender,
report for duty!

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.033
With Goyo Defender, I
can summon reinforcements

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:24.433
to deal you
justice.

00:02:27.633 --> 00:02:29.500
These guys
mean business!

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.066
Now you know why no one has ever
escaped from The Facility.

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:37.333
We gave you a chance
to surrender...

00:02:37.333 --> 00:02:40.033
Now you will suffer
for your disobedience!

(Sylvio)
You three may want
to rethink this.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.066
My father's a powerful
man with connections...

00:03:48.066 --> 00:03:50.566
he'll have your badges if
you aren't careful.

00:03:50.566 --> 00:03:52.800
I don't think they
care about your dad.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:54.200
Trust me, Yuya...

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.500
They will!

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:59.633
Taking center stage is the
knockout performer

00:03:59.633 --> 00:04:02.833
Abyss Actor Sassy Rookie!

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:03.833
Hey!

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:07.100
Let's do this!

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.000
Sassy Rookie, vaporize one
of those Goyo Defenders!

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.433
Fool!

00:04:12.433 --> 00:04:16.300
When you attack Goyo Defender,
it gains 1,000 attack points

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.333
for every other Goyo Defender
on the field.

00:04:19.333 --> 00:04:20.800
Say what?

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:22.966
So big damage is
coming your way!

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:28.900
You're worse at dueling
than making escape plans.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.233
Oh, yeah?

00:04:30.233 --> 00:04:33.233
Well, Sassy Rookie can't be
destroyed once per turn!

00:04:33.233 --> 00:04:35.066
So there!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:39.466
Justice is served!

00:04:41.233 --> 00:04:43.033
Sylvio, you okay?

00:04:43.033 --> 00:04:44.333
Sure am...

00:04:44.333 --> 00:04:46.133
I may be down but
there's no way I'm out!

00:04:46.133 --> 00:04:48.400
You'll see I'll walk
away the winner.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.666
You should walk away
now while you still can!

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:52.600
Forget walking,
we've got to run!

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.966
So let's get moving!

00:04:53.966 --> 00:04:56.633
This is no time to
be lying down!

00:04:56.633 --> 00:04:59.500
When my father is mayor
you are so going to pay,

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.566
but since he's not...

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:01.633
Bye!

00:05:01.633 --> 00:05:04.033
Running will
do you no good!

00:05:04.033 --> 00:05:07.733
We won't stop until our
mission is complete.

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:10.166
We will chase you down like
the rabid animals you are!

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:14.366
This is
getting ridiculous!

00:05:14.366 --> 00:05:16.700
C'mon, shake
a leg, grandpa!

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.600
How about I shake
your head?

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.900
They don't know where
they're going... but I do.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.166
They're ours!

00:05:26.033 --> 00:05:27.100
Yikes!

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.833
We just ran
out of roof!

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:30.200
Then there's only
one thing left to do

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.333
'cause we aren't
going back...

00:05:31.333 --> 00:05:32.333
You gotta jump!

00:05:32.333 --> 00:05:33.333
Without a rope?

00:05:33.333 --> 00:05:35.433
Anybody
got a parachute?

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:37.666
Parachutes are
for wimps!

00:05:37.666 --> 00:05:39.166
(screaming)

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.000
Right behind you!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.666
(computer)
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 life points.

00:05:46.666 --> 00:05:48.866
I got just the thing to give
our landing a little bounce!

00:05:51.366 --> 00:05:53.900
Hightail it,
Performapal Trampolynx!

00:05:59.233 --> 00:06:02.266
I'm giving that leap and
landing a perfect ten.

00:06:02.266 --> 00:06:04.000
More like a five
if you ask me.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.766
And what score do I get
for losing those creeps?

00:06:06.766 --> 00:06:07.900
A zero.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:08.766
They're still
on out tail!

00:06:20.735 --> 00:06:21.668
Exit, stage left!

00:06:21.668 --> 00:06:23.102
Guess we're dueling
on the run!

00:06:23.102 --> 00:06:25.968
Feet don't
fail me now!

00:06:25.968 --> 00:06:28.402
You're not
going anywhere.

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:30.002
This is the end
of the line.

00:06:30.002 --> 00:06:31.402
We have you boxed
in and outnumbered!

00:06:41.168 --> 00:06:42.802
Resistance is futile.

00:06:42.802 --> 00:06:44.235
Escape is not
an option.

00:06:44.235 --> 00:06:45.502
You cannot
outrun justice!

00:06:49.135 --> 00:06:52.168
I tune Jutte Fighter with
two Goyo Defenders!

00:06:56.835 --> 00:06:58.435
This is the end of
the line, lawbreakers.

00:07:01.302 --> 00:07:03.168
I Synchro Summon...

00:07:03.168 --> 00:07:04.335
Goyo King!

00:07:10.502 --> 00:07:13.268
It gains 400 attack points
for each Goyo monster

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:14.768
on the battlefield!

00:07:20.635 --> 00:07:23.335
Goyo King,
search and destroy!

00:07:24.802 --> 00:07:27.235
My trap'll checkmate
your King's move!

00:07:27.235 --> 00:07:29.902
Performance Pirouette
spins Trampolynx

00:07:29.902 --> 00:07:30.835
into defense mode!

00:07:32.335 --> 00:07:33.468
So what?

00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:36.135
Goyo King's special
ability activates!

00:07:36.135 --> 00:07:38.168
After eliminating
one of your monsters,

00:07:38.168 --> 00:07:40.535
it can seize control
of another!

00:07:41.835 --> 00:07:43.368
Not cool!

00:07:43.368 --> 00:07:45.802
Goyo King, use their own
monster to trip them up!

00:07:49.435 --> 00:07:50.635
(screaming)

00:07:53.102 --> 00:07:55.402
You jail breakers
will be back behind bars

00:07:55.402 --> 00:07:58.968
where animals like
you belong.

00:07:58.968 --> 00:08:01.902
If I had Sassy back,
I'd hammer those guys!

00:08:01.902 --> 00:08:03.368
You couldn't
hammer a nail!

00:08:03.368 --> 00:08:05.268
Listen up,
old‐timer!

00:08:05.268 --> 00:08:07.535
This isn't like dueling
in the stone age!

00:08:07.535 --> 00:08:09.002
Oh, really?

00:08:09.002 --> 00:08:10.568
I'll teach you a thing
or two about combat

00:08:10.568 --> 00:08:11.668
when we're out
of this mess!

00:08:11.668 --> 00:08:13.902
(Gong)
Stop your
squabbling, gents!

00:08:13.902 --> 00:08:16.468
Right now we've got
bigger fish t' fry!

00:08:16.468 --> 00:08:19.468
(Yuya)
Gong!

00:08:19.468 --> 00:08:21.802
Gong's taking charge
of this chase...

00:08:21.802 --> 00:08:23.335
By putting
on the brakes!

00:08:25.068 --> 00:08:27.702
(computer)
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 life points.

00:08:29.168 --> 00:08:31.268
Come repel
these thugs...

00:08:31.268 --> 00:08:33.135
Superheavy Samurai
Magnet!

00:08:39.502 --> 00:08:41.902
Why stop at one
when two's better?

00:08:41.902 --> 00:08:45.202
When Gong got one Superheavy
Samurai Magnet on the field,

00:08:45.202 --> 00:08:47.435
Gong can bring out
another one!

00:08:51.168 --> 00:08:53.635
When Superheavy
Samurai Magnet is on the field,

00:08:53.635 --> 00:08:56.535
you're not allowed to attack
any other monster.

00:08:56.535 --> 00:08:58.502
But, since I have two out,

00:08:58.502 --> 00:09:00.435
you can't attack either
one of 'em,

00:09:00.435 --> 00:09:02.602
meaning you
can't attack at all!

00:09:02.602 --> 00:09:04.868
So you made yourself
invincible.

00:09:04.868 --> 00:09:08.135
If you think your pathetic
shield is going to stop justice

00:09:08.135 --> 00:09:10.502
from being served,
you are sadly mistaken!

00:09:11.935 --> 00:09:14.068
Let's show this
fool why!

00:09:14.068 --> 00:09:15.835
By tributing one of
my Goyo monsters,

00:09:15.835 --> 00:09:17.768
Goyo King takes control

00:09:17.768 --> 00:09:20.002
of one of your
Superheavy Samurai Magnets!

00:09:27.068 --> 00:09:30.802
That was so much fun,
I think I'll do it again!

00:09:30.802 --> 00:09:32.668
They stole both!

00:09:32.668 --> 00:09:34.402
Gong's all tapped
out, then.

00:09:34.402 --> 00:09:37.235
Sorry, Yuya, but someone
else'll have to take over.

00:09:37.235 --> 00:09:38.402
That's me!

00:09:38.402 --> 00:09:39.768
(Yuya)
Shay!

00:09:39.768 --> 00:09:42.568
(computer)
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 life points.

00:09:42.568 --> 00:09:43.902
Nice landing!

00:09:43.902 --> 00:09:46.468
Let me show you
how winners win...

00:09:46.468 --> 00:09:49.702
I'll start things off with
the spell Raidraptor Rig!

00:09:49.702 --> 00:09:54.802
I transform all Level 4 monsters
on the field into Winged‐Beasts!

00:09:54.802 --> 00:09:56.702
Sassy Rookie is
Level Four!

00:09:56.702 --> 00:09:58.768
So now it's
a Winged Beast?

00:09:58.768 --> 00:10:01.002
That goes for Gong's
Magnets too!

00:10:01.002 --> 00:10:03.702
It's time to serve
you some justice...

00:10:03.702 --> 00:10:05.968
I play Xyz Rescue!

00:10:05.968 --> 00:10:08.202
This lets me Xyz Summon,
which is why

00:10:08.202 --> 00:10:11.268
I turned those three
monsters into Winged‐Beasts!

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:14.235
I overlay Sassy Rookie and
those two Magnets!

00:10:18.468 --> 00:10:20.268
When will you
glorified meter maids

00:10:20.268 --> 00:10:23.068
learn that the righteous
will always prevail?

00:10:23.068 --> 00:10:26.402
I am the law and
I have found you guilty!

00:10:26.402 --> 00:10:28.035
I Xyz Summon!

00:10:28.035 --> 00:10:30.002
Arise!

00:10:30.002 --> 00:10:32.402
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:10:36.468 --> 00:10:39.402
It only has
100 attack points?

00:10:39.402 --> 00:10:41.102
That bird is
a featherweight!

00:10:41.102 --> 00:10:42.902
Typical prisoner
slime...

00:10:42.902 --> 00:10:46.068
Too stupid to realize
how stupid they really are.

00:10:46.068 --> 00:10:48.868
That's quite the statement
coming from you, tweedle dum.

00:10:48.868 --> 00:10:51.235
How did you pass
traffic school?

00:10:51.235 --> 00:10:53.368
I'm going to enjoy making
you eat those words,

00:10:53.368 --> 00:10:54.968
you insolent peon.

00:10:54.968 --> 00:10:56.602
Not a chance!

00:10:56.602 --> 00:10:59.835
'Cause my featherweight's more
dangerous than you can imagine!

00:10:59.835 --> 00:11:02.902
By using one Overlay Unit,
it gains the attack points

00:11:02.902 --> 00:11:04.802
of every monster
on your field.

00:11:12.935 --> 00:11:14.502
Raid Raptor,
finish...

00:11:14.502 --> 00:11:15.868
them...

00:11:15.868 --> 00:11:16.968
off!

00:11:32.502 --> 00:11:35.168
Yuya, I have to admit you
have some powerful friends.

00:11:35.168 --> 00:11:36.335
(Dennis)
Hey!

00:11:36.335 --> 00:11:38.535
Just when I was gonna make
my grand cameo entrance,

00:11:38.535 --> 00:11:40.868
...you had to go
and steal the show?

00:11:40.868 --> 00:11:41.968
Dennis!

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:44.268
Wait, isn't Celina
supposed to be with you?

00:11:44.268 --> 00:11:45.802
Don't worry,
big stuff!

00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:48.035
I left Celina safe
and sound with Crow

00:11:48.035 --> 00:11:50.435
in case you lot needed
some saving as well.

00:11:50.435 --> 00:11:52.402
Now, let's
shake some legs!

00:11:57.302 --> 00:11:59.702
Yuya, glad you could
join the party.

00:11:59.702 --> 00:12:01.468
Was getting
worried there for a sec.

00:12:01.468 --> 00:12:03.368
So was I.

00:12:03.368 --> 00:12:04.968
It's just
about time.

00:12:04.968 --> 00:12:08.535
Our welcoming committee
should be here soon.

00:12:08.535 --> 00:12:09.968
It's them!

00:12:09.968 --> 00:12:11.335
Let's move!

00:12:11.335 --> 00:12:13.402
Once we reach the other side,
we're free and clear!

00:12:13.402 --> 00:12:14.735
(Tokumatsu)
Come on!
(Shinji)
Stay out of my way!

00:12:14.735 --> 00:12:15.668
Gong
don't float!

00:12:15.668 --> 00:12:16.735
(Damon)
Swimming time!

00:12:16.735 --> 00:12:17.802
(Dennis)
Jump in!

00:12:17.802 --> 00:12:19.802
Hurry!

00:12:19.802 --> 00:12:20.968
Hang on, Zuzu!

00:12:20.968 --> 00:12:22.602
I'm on my way!

00:12:25.002 --> 00:12:26.002
(man)
The jig is up.

00:12:26.002 --> 00:12:27.168
We have you
surrounded.

00:12:39.411 --> 00:12:40.411
(man)
The jig is up.

00:12:40.411 --> 00:12:43.544
We have you
surrounded.

00:12:43.544 --> 00:12:45.344
They knew all
about the plan!

00:12:45.344 --> 00:12:46.944
I'm sorry!

00:12:46.944 --> 00:12:48.144
(grumbles)

00:12:48.144 --> 00:12:50.277
Tony!

00:12:50.277 --> 00:12:51.544
My, my...

00:12:51.544 --> 00:12:53.911
A little late for a dip,
don't you think?

00:12:53.911 --> 00:12:56.444
Someone informed me there
would be a dueling tournament

00:12:56.444 --> 00:12:57.644
in our facility,

00:12:57.644 --> 00:13:01.044
but apparently, it's actually
a swim meet!

00:13:01.044 --> 00:13:02.344
Guys, who's that?

00:13:02.344 --> 00:13:04.844
Allow me to
introduce myself.

00:13:04.844 --> 00:13:08.011
I am responsible for keeping
order in this fair city.

00:13:08.011 --> 00:13:10.077
My name is
Jean Michel Roget

00:13:10.077 --> 00:13:12.577
and I am the Director of
Sector Security.

00:13:12.577 --> 00:13:16.877
I came here to personally end
your escape attempt... for good.

00:13:25.211 --> 00:13:27.044
(groans)

00:13:27.044 --> 00:13:28.244
We failed.

00:13:28.244 --> 00:13:29.811
Now I'll never see
the kids again.

00:13:29.811 --> 00:13:31.144
You can't give up.

00:13:31.144 --> 00:13:32.244
That's not
how we roll.

00:13:32.244 --> 00:13:33.344
That's right.

00:13:33.344 --> 00:13:34.977
(Celina)
Let go,
you donut dunkers!

00:13:34.977 --> 00:13:38.744
And you Director guy, what
you want with us anyway?

00:13:38.744 --> 00:13:40.244
No need to worry.

00:13:40.244 --> 00:13:42.977
As long as you cooperate
with us, you will be fine.

00:13:42.977 --> 00:13:45.277
(helicopter approaching)

00:13:49.411 --> 00:13:52.311
♪

00:13:56.044 --> 00:13:59.211
The High Council wishes to
question your prisoners.

00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:01.711
You must turn
them over to us.

00:14:01.711 --> 00:14:04.544
(man)
We have been given explicit
orders to transport everyone

00:14:04.544 --> 00:14:07.311
you captured to the Hall
of Dominion.

00:14:07.311 --> 00:14:08.677
I refuse.

00:14:08.677 --> 00:14:10.777
By their escape attempt,
these duelists have already

00:14:10.777 --> 00:14:13.244
demonstrated they're a
threat to public safety.

00:14:13.244 --> 00:14:15.277
We cannot release
them to you

00:14:15.277 --> 00:14:18.611
until we've completed
an investi‐‐

00:14:18.611 --> 00:14:21.544
We will decide if these duelists
are a threat to the city.

00:14:21.544 --> 00:14:23.411
Send them to
us at once.

00:14:23.411 --> 00:14:25.177
The council
wills it.

00:14:25.177 --> 00:14:27.077
Isn't that so,
Presider?

00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:29.344
Indeed, we are
all in agreement.

00:14:29.344 --> 00:14:30.877
It is settled.

00:14:37.244 --> 00:14:38.744
(Jean)
You must
rethink this.

00:14:38.744 --> 00:14:40.577
This is a security
matter.

00:14:40.577 --> 00:14:42.777
I can assure you these
duelists and their cohorts

00:14:42.777 --> 00:14:44.711
are extremely
dangerous.

00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:47.877
They're conspiring to spread
mayhem across the city!

00:14:47.877 --> 00:14:49.611
Listen up,
Director!

00:14:49.611 --> 00:14:51.644
My father is a
very powerful man

00:14:51.644 --> 00:14:54.244
and if he finds out how you
treated his son, then you, sir,

00:14:54.244 --> 00:14:56.744
are going to need to
update your resume!

00:14:56.744 --> 00:15:00.344
You disobeyed Sector Security
and that is a serious violation

00:15:00.344 --> 00:15:01.644
of city law.

00:15:01.644 --> 00:15:04.044
You can hardly blame us
for defending ourselves!

00:15:04.044 --> 00:15:06.111
Your troops were hounding
us since we arrived here

00:15:06.111 --> 00:15:07.644
from our
dimension!

00:15:07.644 --> 00:15:10.244
"From your dimension"?

00:15:10.244 --> 00:15:12.077
Members of
the High Council,

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:14.677
you have heard the suspect
for yourselves!

00:15:14.677 --> 00:15:17.711
Quite remarkably, he claims
to have traveled to our world

00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:19.577
from another dimension.

00:15:19.577 --> 00:15:21.844
But that's...
impossible!

00:15:21.844 --> 00:15:24.111
Indeed it does
sound outrageous,

00:15:24.111 --> 00:15:26.977
but it would explain certain
facts I have observed.

00:15:26.977 --> 00:15:29.944
Namely, it would help clarify
why these young duelists

00:15:29.944 --> 00:15:34.711
have mastered three summoning
methods unknown to our world.

00:15:34.711 --> 00:15:37.111
Fusion...

00:15:37.111 --> 00:15:39.777
Then, Xyz...

00:15:39.777 --> 00:15:41.711
And third, Pendulum.

00:15:43.077 --> 00:15:45.511
Naturally, I was concerned when
these strangers suddenly

00:15:45.511 --> 00:15:48.011
showed up, and
began dueling recklessly

00:15:48.011 --> 00:15:50.477
and threatening the peace
of our great City.

00:15:50.477 --> 00:15:52.577
I had to find
out their plans.

00:15:52.577 --> 00:15:56.444
That is precisely why I had my
security forces round them up.

00:15:56.444 --> 00:15:58.377
I find all this
hard to believe.

00:15:58.377 --> 00:16:00.711
Are you really from
another dimension?

00:16:00.711 --> 00:16:01.811
Yes.

00:16:01.811 --> 00:16:03.311
I know it sounds
out of his world.

00:16:03.311 --> 00:16:06.277
Even I have a hard time
believing it sometimes...

00:16:06.277 --> 00:16:07.977
But we're here
as friends!

00:16:07.977 --> 00:16:10.577
We're not out to
hurt anyone, promise.

00:16:10.577 --> 00:16:13.444
Please believe me!

00:16:13.444 --> 00:16:15.877
He speaks the truth.

00:16:15.877 --> 00:16:18.511
We're here for
peace not chaos.

00:16:30.906 --> 00:16:32.839
He speaks the truth.

00:16:32.839 --> 00:16:35.306
We're here for
peace not chaos.

00:16:35.306 --> 00:16:36.439
Look, it's Declan!

00:16:36.439 --> 00:16:37.773
And Riley!

00:16:37.773 --> 00:16:39.673
Took him long
enough to show up.

00:16:39.673 --> 00:16:42.206
Your world will very soon
be under attack

00:16:42.206 --> 00:16:45.006
by warriors from
the Fusion Dimension.

00:16:45.006 --> 00:16:47.239
We can help you
fight them.

00:16:47.239 --> 00:16:49.506
We Lancers are
the best of the best.

00:16:49.506 --> 00:16:50.939
What're Lancers?

00:16:50.939 --> 00:16:53.406
(Sylvio)
Let's just say we know
how to kick duel disk!

00:16:53.406 --> 00:16:55.406
And I'm the number‐one
warrior on the team,

00:16:55.406 --> 00:16:57.873
so that makes me the best
of the best of the best!

00:16:57.873 --> 00:16:59.173
You are?

00:16:59.173 --> 00:17:01.439
Then we're in a
whole heap of trouble.

00:17:01.439 --> 00:17:03.339
(Jean laughing)

00:17:03.339 --> 00:17:04.773
What're you
laughing at?

00:17:04.773 --> 00:17:06.239
Please excuse me.

00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:08.306
Dimensions fighting
each other?

00:17:08.306 --> 00:17:11.639
I could maybe buy dimension
travel, but dimensional wars?

00:17:11.639 --> 00:17:12.973
Listen, pal!

00:17:12.973 --> 00:17:14.706
I don't like
your 'tude.

00:17:14.706 --> 00:17:17.206
If you don't want my help,
then I'm happy not to give it.

00:17:17.206 --> 00:17:19.039
(Gale)
Silence, please!

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:23.006
Let us review the statements
presented by Declan Akaba.

00:17:23.006 --> 00:17:25.306
There is an
interdimensional war.

00:17:25.306 --> 00:17:27.439
Which now threatens
our world.

00:17:27.439 --> 00:17:29.906
And you have
come to help us.

00:17:29.906 --> 00:17:32.939
Yes, we understand
everything perfectly.

00:17:32.939 --> 00:17:35.906
I'm sure my father could use
someone as level headed as you

00:17:35.906 --> 00:17:38.039
and your pals on his staff
when he's mayor.

00:17:38.039 --> 00:17:39.406
Hold on!

00:17:39.406 --> 00:17:42.206
Do you mean to tell me you
actually believe their tale?

00:17:42.206 --> 00:17:44.173
How do we know they
aren't lying?

00:17:44.173 --> 00:17:45.973
Their veracity is
still up for debate.

00:17:45.973 --> 00:17:48.073
Let us begin with the
question of whether or not

00:17:48.073 --> 00:17:50.439
they traveled here from
a different dimension.

00:17:50.439 --> 00:17:53.039
Their claim to be
interdimensional duel warriors

00:17:53.039 --> 00:17:54.773
seems most
extraordinary...

00:17:54.773 --> 00:17:56.073
Yet how else can
we explain

00:17:56.073 --> 00:17:57.606
their incredible
summoning methods?

00:17:59.239 --> 00:18:01.606
Even if they are
what they claim...

00:18:01.606 --> 00:18:03.773
How can we be certain they
aren't the invaders

00:18:03.773 --> 00:18:06.139
who are planning
to take over our world?

00:18:06.139 --> 00:18:07.439
What?

00:18:07.439 --> 00:18:08.806
You think
we're invaders?

00:18:08.806 --> 00:18:10.539
We came here to
help your world!

00:18:10.539 --> 00:18:12.406
Your real enemies
aren't here yet!

00:18:12.406 --> 00:18:14.173
Even though you're doing
an excellent job

00:18:14.173 --> 00:18:16.173
of making me want
to turn into one.

00:18:16.173 --> 00:18:18.606
(Yuya)
When Obelisk Force arrives,
they'll destroy everything

00:18:18.606 --> 00:18:19.673
in their path...

00:18:19.673 --> 00:18:21.906
Unless you join
forces with us first!

00:18:21.906 --> 00:18:24.073
My security team is
quite capable.

00:18:24.073 --> 00:18:27.273
We don't need
your help.

00:18:27.273 --> 00:18:30.273
As for the matter of your true
identities, our probe will‐‐

00:18:30.273 --> 00:18:31.873
(Gale)
Enough, Director!

00:18:31.873 --> 00:18:33.606
We will take over!

00:18:33.606 --> 00:18:36.639
From this moment forward, all of
these people will be sequestered

00:18:36.639 --> 00:18:39.073
under the direct supervision
of the High Council.

00:18:39.073 --> 00:18:40.439
Under direct
supervision?

00:18:40.439 --> 00:18:42.006
I've been locked
up for ten years

00:18:42.006 --> 00:18:44.573
and I only get to taste
freedom for three seconds?

00:18:44.573 --> 00:18:46.439
There will be
no exceptions.

00:18:46.439 --> 00:18:48.506
(Boldo)
You claim to be friends
of this world.

00:18:48.506 --> 00:18:51.239
Now you will have a
chance to prove that to us.

00:18:51.239 --> 00:18:54.006
(Sylvio)
Uh...
Prove it how?

00:18:54.006 --> 00:18:57.406
By entering the Friendship
Cup dueling tournament.

00:18:57.406 --> 00:18:59.673
A dueling tournament?

00:18:59.673 --> 00:19:02.639
If these people do not choose
to believe that we Lancers

00:19:02.639 --> 00:19:04.873
have what it takes to
protect this dimension,

00:19:04.873 --> 00:19:07.673
we're entering the tournament to
show them how skilled we are.

00:19:09.939 --> 00:19:12.506
If it means a warm
shower, I'm in.

00:19:12.506 --> 00:19:14.073
It's
settled then.

00:19:14.073 --> 00:19:15.973
Really?

00:19:15.973 --> 00:19:18.839
It was always my desire
to enter the Friendship Cup.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:21.606
I'm just surprised you are
allowing me to compete.

00:19:21.606 --> 00:19:25.006
(White)
We are especially eager for
you to participate,

00:19:25.006 --> 00:19:27.106
Chojiro Tokumatsu.

00:19:27.106 --> 00:19:30.839
After all, the Friendship Cup
exists because of you.

00:19:30.839 --> 00:19:32.573
Because of me?

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:36.939
Your imprisonment ten years
ago was one of the main causes

00:19:36.939 --> 00:19:40.373
of the revolt that tore
our city apart.

00:19:40.373 --> 00:19:42.773
Ever since then,
Topsiders and Commons

00:19:42.773 --> 00:19:45.673
have lived in continual
conflict.

00:19:45.673 --> 00:19:48.939
As a direct result,
we formed the elite unit

00:19:48.939 --> 00:19:52.806
known as Duel Chasers to
suppress the unrest.

00:19:52.806 --> 00:19:56.139
Unfortunately, our attempt
to crack down on the dissenters

00:19:56.139 --> 00:19:59.073
led to even greater
turmoil.

00:19:59.073 --> 00:20:02.406
It is our sincere hope
that the Friendship Cup

00:20:02.406 --> 00:20:05.339
will continue to heal the
divisions in our city

00:20:05.339 --> 00:20:09.139
and bring both sides
together uniting us once again.

00:20:09.139 --> 00:20:10.573
And look!

00:20:10.573 --> 00:20:13.973
Jack Atlas is a symbol of that
because he came from Commons

00:20:13.973 --> 00:20:18.639
and is now celebrated by
Topsiders and Commons alike.

00:20:18.639 --> 00:20:19.906
Jack's a jerk...

00:20:19.906 --> 00:20:21.806
He doesn't represent us
and I ain't gonna enter

00:20:21.806 --> 00:20:23.606
and be a part of
your dog and pony show

00:20:23.606 --> 00:20:25.506
to entertain
the Topsiders!

00:20:25.506 --> 00:20:28.339
But Crow, this is the only
way for you to let Frankie

00:20:28.339 --> 00:20:31.639
and the kids know
that you're safe and sound.

00:20:31.639 --> 00:20:33.206
I'm in!

00:20:33.206 --> 00:20:35.939
After ten long years,
my comeback finally begins!

00:20:35.939 --> 00:20:37.173
Yeah, let's duel!

00:20:37.173 --> 00:20:40.206
With my superhuman duel
skills and star‐like charisma,

00:20:40.206 --> 00:20:42.139
I'll take the Synchro
Dimension by storm!

00:20:42.139 --> 00:20:43.939
It's more important
to find Zuzu!

00:20:43.939 --> 00:20:45.406
(Jean)
Zuzu?

00:20:45.406 --> 00:20:47.473
You mean
Zuzu Boyle?

00:20:47.473 --> 00:20:50.939
I knew that rabble‐rouser
was one of you!

00:20:50.939 --> 00:20:52.273
Zuzu?

00:20:52.273 --> 00:20:53.673
You have her?
Where is she?

00:20:53.673 --> 00:20:55.039
Calm down...

00:20:55.039 --> 00:20:57.173
Don't want you bursting
a blood vessel.

00:20:57.173 --> 00:20:58.406
She's safe.

00:20:58.406 --> 00:21:00.373
I mean, why would we ever
harm another competitor

00:21:00.373 --> 00:21:02.239
in the Friendship Cup?

00:21:02.239 --> 00:21:04.006
Zuzu's dueling in
the tournament, too?

00:21:07.773 --> 00:21:10.173
That's seem to have
sparked your interest.

00:21:10.173 --> 00:21:12.573
I'm sure your friend will
be delighted to learn

00:21:12.573 --> 00:21:14.439
that you are
participating as well.

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:19.373
High Council, I agree
that inviting these duelists

00:21:19.373 --> 00:21:22.373
to compete in the Friendship
Cup is a marvelous idea.

00:21:22.373 --> 00:21:25.773
However, I would like
to add another proposal.

00:21:25.773 --> 00:21:26.973
Which is?

00:21:26.973 --> 00:21:28.139
Speak up!

00:21:28.139 --> 00:21:29.639
As you know,
it's become tradition

00:21:29.639 --> 00:21:31.273
for the Friendship Cup's
champion

00:21:31.273 --> 00:21:34.906
to hold an exhibition duel just
prior to the opening ceremonies.

00:21:34.906 --> 00:21:37.639
I humbly propose that
Yuya Sakaki be invited

00:21:37.639 --> 00:21:39.239
to challenge Jack Atlas.

00:21:39.239 --> 00:21:40.706
Why me?

00:21:40.706 --> 00:21:42.406
A good question.

00:21:42.406 --> 00:21:45.806
Based on my observations,
Yuya is the most talented

00:21:45.806 --> 00:21:47.839
of this group
before you.

00:21:47.839 --> 00:21:50.773
That will make him
an ideal competitor.

00:21:50.773 --> 00:21:52.306
We'll see how his
Pendulum Summoning

00:21:52.306 --> 00:21:54.373
matches up against
Jack Atlas.

00:21:54.373 --> 00:21:56.239
Interesting.

00:21:56.239 --> 00:21:58.339
No objections,
Presider?

00:21:58.339 --> 00:22:00.906
I like the idea!

00:22:00.906 --> 00:22:02.406
And you?

00:22:02.406 --> 00:22:04.306
I have no objections,
of course.
