00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.200
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V."

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.600
Hey, Declan!

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.833
We thought the battle royal

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:08.966
was the next stage of
the Championship,

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:10.800
and now we find out
it was just some sort of

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.366
lame tryout to become
one of your Lancers?

00:00:13.366 --> 00:00:15.866
I am simply trying to
save our world, Yuya.

00:00:15.866 --> 00:00:18.833
Once I learned Warriors
from the Fusion Dimension

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.866
were planning to
infiltrate our home,

00:00:20.866 --> 00:00:24.700
I needed a way to stand up to
them without causing a panic.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.400
We have to take the battle to
the Fusion Dimension.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.400
And you and your fellow Lancers
will lead that charge!

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:33.400
And end up like our friends?

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.466
Turned into cards?

00:00:35.466 --> 00:00:39.833
And Zuzu, what about her?

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:41.933
What if they got
to Zuzu, too?

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:44.333
She might be gone forever!

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:47.833
Everything that happened to my
friends is all your fault!

00:00:47.833 --> 00:00:52.566
You set us up, and now,
I'm gonna take you down!

00:00:52.566 --> 00:00:54.066
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:57.133
Yuya, you picked a battle you
could never win!

00:00:57.133 --> 00:01:01.733
Now feel the full force of
Flame King's ferocity!

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:04.666
Aah!
Uhh!

00:01:04.666 --> 00:01:06.700
I Fusion Summon!

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.533
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.400
(roaring)

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.533
Battling Obelisk Force
is no game.

00:01:14.533 --> 00:01:16.733
But I know you and your friends
have what it takes

00:01:16.733 --> 00:01:18.400
to go deck to deck with them.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.033
I'll never join your Lancers!

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.166
Not even to save your dear
friend Zuzu?

What's the deal, Declan?

00:02:29.266 --> 00:02:31.900
Are you telling me you know
what happened to Zuzu?

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.633
If Obelisk Force has her, they
must have taken her back

00:02:34.633 --> 00:02:38.300
to the Fusion Dimension,
back to the Professor.

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.600
Mr. President,
we found Celina!

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.800
Quick, send our
top duelists to help her!

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.700
We can't let her be captured!

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.033
Hold on.
That girl isn't Celina.

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.900
To the untrained eye,
she could pass for her,

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.633
but I'm certain
that's Zuzu Boyle.

00:02:51.633 --> 00:02:54.433
What I don't know is
who she's hiding from.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:56.966
She appears to be terrified.

00:02:58.966 --> 00:03:00.966
What's this?

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.900
What happened?

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.333
That's the mystery duelist
from Synchro!

00:03:08.333 --> 00:03:10.633
You're safe!

00:03:15.666 --> 00:03:17.300
Find them now!

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:20.300
(thinking)
My intel team has no idea where
Zuzu vanished to,

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.900
but it appears Duel Academy

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.166
had nothing to do with her
disappearance.

00:03:24.166 --> 00:03:28.166
For now, though, it's better
if Yuya believes they did.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:29.800
You want to save Zuzu?

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.600
Well let's see if
that's even possible.

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.733
Let's see if you have what it
takes to defeat me first.

00:03:34.733 --> 00:03:36.033
(growls)

00:03:36.033 --> 00:03:39.766
Why does Declan want to recruit
Yuya into the Lancers?

00:03:39.766 --> 00:03:42.666
The boy opposes everything
Declan stands for.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.000
He's mastered
Pendulum Summoning,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.800
which Declan believes
is needed to stand a chance

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:49.800
at defeating
the Fusion Dimension.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.466
My son may be correct,

00:03:51.466 --> 00:03:55.100
but I suspect this Yuya may be
more trouble than he's worth.

00:03:57.133 --> 00:03:58.566
It's my move.

00:03:58.566 --> 00:04:00.233
I draw!

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:01.766
First, I'll set
the Pendulum Scale

00:04:01.766 --> 00:04:04.166
with Scale 1 D/D
Savant Galilei

00:04:04.166 --> 00:04:06.433
and Scale 10 D/D Savant Kepler!

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:14.366
I can now summon monsters
from Level 2 through 9
at the same time!

00:04:14.366 --> 00:04:15.366
Oh!

00:04:15.366 --> 00:04:16.466
Uh‐oh!

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:19.266
Looks like things are
swinging Declan's way.

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:21.900
You may have uncovered the
Pendulum technique, Yuya,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.266
but I have taken it further than
you could have imagined

00:04:24.266 --> 00:04:27.200
by perfecting it!

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.966
I Pendulum Summon!

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.966
Make way for the tyrannical
overlord of despair,

00:04:31.966 --> 00:04:34.200
disorder and devastation...

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.333
D/D/D Oblivion King Abyss
Ragnarok!

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:41.066
(roaring)

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.833
Having summoned my Ragnarok
successfully,

00:04:45.833 --> 00:04:49.766
I can now resurrect a D/D/D
monster from my graveyard!

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:53.500
Return, D/D/D Wave King Caesar!

00:04:56.466 --> 00:04:59.033
(thinking)
Declan's Kings are super
dangerous,

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:01.333
and they both have king‐sized
powers.

00:05:01.333 --> 00:05:03.466
But neither of 'em packs
enough attack points

00:05:03.466 --> 00:05:07.133
to bring down my Dragons!

00:05:07.133 --> 00:05:09.933
Next I summon
D/D Necro Slime!

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:16.866
Then I activate Abyss
Ragnarok's special ability!

00:05:16.866 --> 00:05:19.066
By tributing D/D Necro Slime,

00:05:19.066 --> 00:05:22.066
I banish one monster
on your field!

00:05:24.466 --> 00:05:27.833
You must now bid farewell
to Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:05:27.833 --> 00:05:28.800
Oh, no!

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:33.800
My Dragon!

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.933
At least he can still
count on Beast‐Eyes!

00:05:35.933 --> 00:05:40.600
I activate Necro Slime's
special ability from my
graveyard!

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:45.433
By banishing it, I can Fusion
Summon a D/D/D Monster.

00:05:45.433 --> 00:05:47.600
Aah!
Gong don't like this!

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:49.533
And neither does Yuya!

00:05:49.533 --> 00:05:51.333
Then I guess that just
leaves me!

00:05:51.333 --> 00:05:55.200
I fuse my abyss Ragnarok and
Wave King Caesar together

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:58.866
to form a force that will bring
you to your knees!

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.500
I Fusion Summon...

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.966
D/D/D Wave Oblivion King Caesar
Ragnarok!

00:06:06.966 --> 00:06:09.133
(roaring)

00:06:11.866 --> 00:06:14.800
It's more powerful than my
Dragon.

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:16.766
And your troubles
are far from over!

00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:21.766
I activate D/D/D Wave King
Caesar's special ability
from my graveyard!

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:23.066
I now have free reign

00:06:23.066 --> 00:06:26.833
to add one Dark Contract card
from my deck to my hand.

00:06:26.833 --> 00:06:28.466
The time has come!

00:06:28.466 --> 00:06:30.966
Caesar Ragnarok, focus
all your ferocity

00:06:30.966 --> 00:06:34.533
on Yuya's Beast‐Eyes Pendulum
Dragon!

00:06:34.533 --> 00:06:37.266
Savage Retribution!

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:44.066
Aah! Beast‐Eyes!

00:06:46.452 --> 00:06:48.985
Savage Retribution!

00:06:52.385 --> 00:06:55.485
Aah! Beast‐Eyes!

00:06:55.485 --> 00:06:58.885
Yuya's dragons are dropping
left and right!

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:00.119
Poor Yuya!

00:07:00.119 --> 00:07:02.085
My duelmate's field is
monster‐less!

00:07:02.085 --> 00:07:03.285
(growls)

00:07:03.285 --> 00:07:05.019
Is this the best you've got?

00:07:05.019 --> 00:07:06.719
What did you say?

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:08.785
I said is this the best
you've got?

00:07:08.785 --> 00:07:11.819
I've done nothing
but pick you apart.

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.619
And I haven't even
broken a sweat yet.

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:18.819
You think you can save Zuzu
with these paltry skills?

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:20.552
Don't make me laugh, Yuya.

00:07:20.552 --> 00:07:22.685
This isn't the time for jokes.

00:07:22.685 --> 00:07:25.519
I don't think Zuzu would find
any of this amusing.

00:07:25.519 --> 00:07:27.852
I don't want to hear the name
Zuzu cross your lips

00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:31.419
unless it's to tell me
how to rescue her from
Fusion Dimension!

00:07:31.419 --> 00:07:33.752
I'll tell you
if you defeat me.

00:07:33.752 --> 00:07:35.552
Consider it a bonus.

00:07:35.552 --> 00:07:38.785
You want to get revenge and
pummel me anyway, right?

00:07:38.785 --> 00:07:40.719
Because you hold me
responsible

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:44.085
for your poor friends
becoming...

00:07:44.085 --> 00:07:46.119
two dimensional?

00:07:46.119 --> 00:07:49.119
I'll bet they'll make
the perfect addition
to someone's deck.

00:07:49.119 --> 00:07:52.152
That is, of course, if they
haven't already.

00:07:52.152 --> 00:07:54.085
Uhh! Aah!

00:07:59.919 --> 00:08:03.452
Aah! Aah!

00:08:03.452 --> 00:08:04.819
Yuya!

00:08:04.819 --> 00:08:06.919
Declan's gotta chill out.

00:08:06.919 --> 00:08:09.819
He's driving Yuya
over the edge!

00:08:09.819 --> 00:08:11.652
(groaning)

00:08:15.119 --> 00:08:16.885
All right, Declan!

00:08:16.885 --> 00:08:19.019
You want me to come at you
full force?

00:08:19.019 --> 00:08:20.952
I'll be more than happy
to humor you!

00:08:20.952 --> 00:08:22.819
I pendulum Summon!

00:08:25.885 --> 00:08:30.885
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:08:30.885 --> 00:08:34.652
Say hello to
Stargazer Magician!

00:08:34.652 --> 00:08:38.352
And Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:08:38.352 --> 00:08:40.985
(roaring)

00:08:40.985 --> 00:08:44.219
Plus, I'm inviting Performapal
Pendulum Sorcerer

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:46.519
to join this party, too!

00:08:48.152 --> 00:08:51.785
I activate Xiangsheng
Magician's Pendulum ability!

00:08:51.785 --> 00:08:55.352
I'm taking aim and my game to
the next level!

00:09:00.385 --> 00:09:02.052
Stargazer Magician
will now have

00:09:02.052 --> 00:09:06.785
the same Level as Pendulum
Sorcerer!

00:09:06.785 --> 00:09:08.985
He's got 2 Level 4 monsters!

00:09:08.985 --> 00:09:12.519
I overlay Stargazer Magician
and Pendulum Sorcerer

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.052
in order to build
the Overlay Network!

00:09:17.485 --> 00:09:20.652
Cloaked in shadows and
relentless in its objective,

00:09:20.652 --> 00:09:24.752
I call upon the most dangerous
of Dragons!

00:09:24.752 --> 00:09:27.152
I Xyz Summon!

00:09:27.152 --> 00:09:30.552
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon!

00:09:35.052 --> 00:09:37.485
That's Yuto's dragon!

00:09:37.485 --> 00:09:39.552
(thinking)
Excellent.

00:09:39.552 --> 00:09:43.752
I'm now activating
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon's
special ability.

00:09:43.752 --> 00:09:45.885
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:09:45.885 --> 00:09:49.085
the attack points of your Caesar
Ragnarok are cut in half!

00:09:49.085 --> 00:09:51.419
And then Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:09:51.419 --> 00:09:53.885
gains those attack points.

00:09:53.885 --> 00:09:55.752
(roaring)

00:10:00.085 --> 00:10:04.419
Now I'll use the remaining
Overlay Unit to weaken your
monster again!

00:10:07.519 --> 00:10:09.719
Ragnarok is on the ropes!

00:10:09.719 --> 00:10:11.652
My Yuya's so gonna win this!

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:13.619
This is for Zuzu!

00:10:13.619 --> 00:10:15.319
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon,

00:10:15.319 --> 00:10:18.452
attack with Mauling Mandable
Charge!

00:10:22.352 --> 00:10:25.585
I activate Caesar Ragnarok's
special ability!

00:10:25.585 --> 00:10:27.652
By returning Kepler
to my hand,

00:10:27.652 --> 00:10:30.252
I can equip your monster onto
Caesar Ragnarok,

00:10:30.252 --> 00:10:34.419
and it then gains your
monster's attack points!

00:10:34.419 --> 00:10:38.185
The monster I choose
is Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:10:38.185 --> 00:10:41.319
Ragnarok, reel it in!

00:10:43.385 --> 00:10:45.919
(roaring)

00:10:45.919 --> 00:10:48.419
Odd‐Eyes, no!

00:10:54.219 --> 00:10:55.919
(roaring)

00:11:00.619 --> 00:11:04.385
I end my turn...
with a facedown.

00:11:04.385 --> 00:11:07.119
Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's attack points

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:08.352
now return to normal.

00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:10.952
You were lucky,
but I'll finish you next turn.

00:11:10.952 --> 00:11:13.519
You've done well.
Huh?

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:16.152
You once relied exclusively
on Pendulum Summoning,

00:11:16.152 --> 00:11:18.385
but your skill set has evolved.

00:11:18.385 --> 00:11:20.819
I'm curious.

00:11:20.819 --> 00:11:24.385
I know Zuzu inspired you to
learn how to Fusion Summon.

00:11:24.385 --> 00:11:27.985
but which friend introduced you
to the world of Xyz Summoning?

00:11:29.985 --> 00:11:31.885
Oh, it doesn't matter.

00:11:31.885 --> 00:11:35.252
I'll have plenty of time to
find out who that someone was,

00:11:35.252 --> 00:11:38.769
after I wipe
the floor with you!

00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.353
Prepare yourself, Yuya,

00:11:43.353 --> 00:11:46.186
the Pendulum is
swinging my way now!

00:11:46.186 --> 00:11:48.353
It's my move!

00:11:48.353 --> 00:11:52.786
D/D Savant Galilei's Pendulum
ability activates,

00:11:52.786 --> 00:11:55.186
raising its Scale
from 1 to 3.

00:11:57.153 --> 00:11:58.420
Next from my hand,

00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.986
I'm using D/D Savant Kepler to
set the Pendulum Scale.

00:12:05.386 --> 00:12:08.486
Now I can summon monsters
between Level 4 and 9

00:12:08.486 --> 00:12:10.486
all at the same time!

00:12:10.486 --> 00:12:13.086
First, I'll call two of my most
ruthless Kings

00:12:13.086 --> 00:12:14.753
onto the field of battle.

00:12:14.753 --> 00:12:17.553
Their faces should be very
familiar to you.

00:12:17.553 --> 00:12:22.453
I Pendulum Summon D/D/D Oblivion
King Abyss Ragnarok!

00:12:22.453 --> 00:12:24.486
(roaring)

00:12:27.086 --> 00:12:29.453
And D/D/D Doom King
Armageddon!

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.720
Are you kidding?
What?

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.353
That monster's a maniac!

00:12:37.353 --> 00:12:41.120
Yuya faced him
once before and nearly
got Armageddoned himself!

00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:45.653
I play a trap!

00:12:45.653 --> 00:12:48.853
Wings of Misdirection!

00:12:48.853 --> 00:12:50.320
It prevents you
from activating

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:52.953
any of your monsters special
abilities!

00:12:52.953 --> 00:12:55.353
And it lets me increase
the attack points

00:12:55.353 --> 00:12:57.986
of my Dark Rebellion by 800!

00:12:59.686 --> 00:13:01.953
Yuya's XYZ Dragon
is now more powerful

00:13:01.953 --> 00:13:03.453
than Declan's Armageddon!

00:13:03.453 --> 00:13:06.286
Declan must be shakin'
in his duel disk!

00:13:06.286 --> 00:13:07.553
Very good, Yuya.

00:13:07.553 --> 00:13:10.053
Now let's see how far
you can be pushed.

00:13:10.053 --> 00:13:12.220
I overlay Abyss Ragnarok

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:16.586
and Doom King Armageddon to
build the Overlay Network!

00:13:16.586 --> 00:13:19.620
(roaring)

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:20.653
Unreal.

00:13:20.653 --> 00:13:22.220
Gong can't believe
Gong's eyes!

00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:23.453
My poor Yuya!

00:13:33.853 --> 00:13:36.153
I Xyz Summon!

00:13:36.153 --> 00:13:40.986
D/D/D Duo‐Dawn King Kali Yuga!

00:13:40.986 --> 00:13:43.953
(sinister laugh)

00:13:43.953 --> 00:13:46.820
It's stronger
than my Dragon!

00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:48.286
More than you know, Yuya!

00:13:48.286 --> 00:13:51.420
Kali Yuga neutralizes your trap,
weakening your Dragon,

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.553
thus making my King
even more devastating!

00:13:54.553 --> 00:13:56.986
No way!

00:13:59.753 --> 00:14:01.086
Get ready!

00:14:01.086 --> 00:14:03.553
Duo‐Dawn King Kali Yuga,

00:14:03.553 --> 00:14:08.253
take out Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon with Bolts of Banishment!

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:16.720
Aah!

00:14:23.086 --> 00:14:24.886
Yuya!

00:14:24.886 --> 00:14:26.053
Sweetie‐pie!

00:14:26.053 --> 00:14:28.420
This duel has been a
disappointment.

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:30.386
I expected more from you.

00:14:30.386 --> 00:14:32.253
Much more.

00:14:32.253 --> 00:14:33.920
All your threats
to make me pay

00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:37.386
for what happened to friends
have come to nothing.

00:14:37.386 --> 00:14:40.320
You're too weak to make me pay
for anything!

00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.753
That's enough, Declan!

00:14:41.753 --> 00:14:43.753
We're on our way, Yuya!

00:14:43.753 --> 00:14:44.886
No, stay back!

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.253
I can handle it!

00:14:48.253 --> 00:14:50.886
I'm gonna win for my friends,

00:14:50.886 --> 00:14:54.420
for you, for Zuzu,
and even Yuto!

00:14:54.420 --> 00:14:56.120
Yuto?

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:58.320
After I'm done
with you, Declan,

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.520
nothing will stop me from
rescuing Zuzu.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:03.886
Or from keeping my promise
to Yuto!

00:15:03.886 --> 00:15:06.086
Always remember...

00:15:06.086 --> 00:15:07.753
Use your power...

00:15:07.753 --> 00:15:12.353
to keep the world
entertained and smiling.

00:15:12.353 --> 00:15:14.886
The only thing you care you
care about is combat, Declan!

00:15:14.886 --> 00:15:18.220
But that isn't what dueling
is supposed to be about!

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.386
If you have your way,
the fighting will never end!

00:15:20.386 --> 00:15:23.320
Which is why losing's
not in the cards!

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.720
It never was!

00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.953
It's my move!
Aah!

00:15:28.953 --> 00:15:33.753
I'll beat you with the help of
Shuffle Reborn!

00:15:33.753 --> 00:15:37.253
I may not have any monsters on
my field, but that's okay,

00:15:37.253 --> 00:15:39.986
'cause that lets me put
my spell into action!

00:15:39.986 --> 00:15:42.986
Now I can bring Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon back,

00:15:42.986 --> 00:15:46.386
but it won't have its special
abilities!

00:15:46.386 --> 00:15:48.786
(roaring)

00:15:48.786 --> 00:15:50.053
All right!

00:15:50.053 --> 00:15:52.020
Sweet!

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:55.586
Next, Shuffle Reborn returns
Trump Witch to my deck.

00:15:55.586 --> 00:15:57.920
Then I can draw a card!

00:15:57.920 --> 00:15:59.953
Here goes!

00:15:59.953 --> 00:16:02.286
All right, it's show time!

00:16:02.286 --> 00:16:03.786
Perfect!

00:16:03.786 --> 00:16:06.420
Now I'll use Scale 3 Xiangke
Magician

00:16:06.420 --> 00:16:10.086
and Scale 8 Xiangsheng Magician
to set the Pendulum Scale!

00:16:10.086 --> 00:16:14.020
I'm taking control of
this duel starting now!

00:16:19.653 --> 00:16:23.886
I can summon monsters between
Level 4 and 7 at the same time!

00:16:25.153 --> 00:16:26.953
Swing far, Pendulum!

00:16:26.953 --> 00:16:29.920
Carve the Arc of Victory!

00:16:29.920 --> 00:16:34.186
My monsters are ready to swing
into action!

00:16:34.186 --> 00:16:38.353
Get set to turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:41.820
(roaring)

00:16:41.820 --> 00:16:46.486
Now Xiangke Magician, I call on
you to work your sorcery!

00:16:46.486 --> 00:16:48.120
Use your Pendulum ability

00:16:48.120 --> 00:16:52.153
to change Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon's Rank into a Level!

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.220
(roaring)

00:17:05.153 --> 00:17:07.986
I've never seen anything
like this before!

00:17:09.853 --> 00:17:12.653
Xiangsheng Magician's Pendulum
ability activates,

00:17:12.653 --> 00:17:18.153
so I'm taking aim and my game
to the next level one more time!

00:17:20.086 --> 00:17:22.086
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
will now have

00:17:22.086 --> 00:17:24.953
the same Level as Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:17:24.953 --> 00:17:26.953
The stage has been set!

00:17:26.953 --> 00:17:29.386
Hmm. Nice move.

00:17:29.386 --> 00:17:31.820
I overlay Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon

00:17:31.820 --> 00:17:34.053
and Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon

00:17:34.053 --> 00:17:36.520
in order to build the Overlay
Network!

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:42.020
If Declan wants me to throw
my best at him,

00:17:42.020 --> 00:17:46.353
then this should certainly
make him happy!

00:17:46.353 --> 00:17:48.086
I Xyz Summon!

00:17:48.086 --> 00:17:51.486
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:17:54.686 --> 00:17:56.620
Here we go!

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.353
Yuya.

00:18:02.353 --> 00:18:04.953
You have not disappointed me.

00:18:04.953 --> 00:18:07.620
Next, I activate the trap
Wings of Misdirection

00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:09.353
from my graveyard!

00:18:09.353 --> 00:18:10.653
By banishing it,

00:18:10.653 --> 00:18:13.220
along with my Xiangke and
Xiangsheng Magicians,

00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:17.153
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon gets
an 800 attack‐point power up!

00:18:20.053 --> 00:18:21.020
(roaring)

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:22.453
But that's not all!

00:18:22.453 --> 00:18:24.486
You can't activate any
facedown cards,

00:18:24.486 --> 00:18:27.853
and all your monster's special
abilities are negated!

00:18:27.853 --> 00:18:32.053
Duo‐Dawn King Kali Yuga special
ability activates!

00:18:32.053 --> 00:18:35.353
Your trap has no reign
over my King!

00:18:35.353 --> 00:18:37.786
So what?
That changes nothing.

00:18:37.786 --> 00:18:40.553
It might have 3,500
attack points.

00:18:40.553 --> 00:18:42.653
But my Odd‐Eyes trumps that!

00:18:42.653 --> 00:18:47.053
Plus, you can't activate
the facedown cards to
save your Kali Yuga!

00:18:47.053 --> 00:18:48.920
Face it.

00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.986
You're finished!

00:18:49.986 --> 00:18:51.420
Let's do this, Odd‐Eyes!

00:18:55.786 --> 00:18:58.720
Sweeping Static Strike!

00:19:04.886 --> 00:19:07.686
Sweeping Static Strike!

00:19:11.786 --> 00:19:15.420
I activate Kali Yuga's
special ability!

00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.320
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.686
all spell and trap cards on my
field are destroyed!

00:19:20.686 --> 00:19:24.653
Then I'll use its second
Overlay Unit to bring them back!

00:19:28.220 --> 00:19:31.120
Your Wings of Misdirection can
only affect those cards

00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.853
that were on the field at the
moment the trap was activated.

00:19:33.853 --> 00:19:37.286
That means it no longer affects
the cards I just brought back,

00:19:37.286 --> 00:19:39.420
so I can now play them!

00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:43.420
First, I'll put my trap Dark
Contract with Errors to use!

00:19:43.420 --> 00:19:45.853
Neutralizing your Wings of
Misdirection,

00:19:45.853 --> 00:19:49.520
weakening your precious
Dragon!

00:19:52.153 --> 00:19:55.586
(gasps)
This is only the beginning!

00:19:55.586 --> 00:19:59.320
I now activate the trap
Dark Contract With Renewal!

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:04.020
This allows me to use
Wings Of Misdirection's
effect to my advantage!

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.420
Seriously?

00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:06.986
If you don't believe me,

00:20:06.986 --> 00:20:11.386
then watch as Kali Yuga grows
800 attack points stronger!

00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:15.286
The tables have turned, Yuya!

00:20:15.286 --> 00:20:16.820
Kali Yuga!

00:20:16.820 --> 00:20:20.520
Strike back at Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon!

00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:23.920
(roaring)

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.053
Aah!

00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.353
Yuya!

00:20:45.353 --> 00:20:47.186
Poor guy.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:51.886
Your endgame needs substantial
improvement.

00:20:51.886 --> 00:20:53.920
There's still much
you have to learn

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.820
if you want to rescue Zuzu.

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:57.253
(groaning)

00:20:57.253 --> 00:20:59.553
Still, you do show promise.

00:20:59.553 --> 00:21:00.853
You all do.

00:21:00.853 --> 00:21:02.386
Your Pendulum Summoning skills

00:21:02.386 --> 00:21:04.520
have developed more quickly
than I expected,

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:07.753
and that's just what I need to
take on the Fusion Dimension.

00:21:07.753 --> 00:21:09.486
So instead of just Yuya,

00:21:09.486 --> 00:21:12.486
I will make you all
my Lancers.

00:21:12.486 --> 00:21:16.886
Together we will travel to
the Fusion Dimension.

00:21:16.886 --> 00:21:19.353
Sounds like it could
be a long trip.

00:21:22.286 --> 00:21:25.586
Claude, did you record the data
I requested from this duel?

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:26.886
(Claude)
Yes, Mr. President.

00:21:26.886 --> 00:21:28.286
Well done.

00:21:28.286 --> 00:21:30.020
I want to review everything.

00:21:34.253 --> 00:21:37.120
I have to face facts.

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.686
Declan was right.

00:21:38.686 --> 00:21:41.786
I'm not strong enough
to rescue Zuzu yet.

00:21:41.786 --> 00:21:43.086
But I promise.

00:21:43.086 --> 00:21:46.453
One day, I will be.

00:21:47.553 --> 00:21:51.120
Zuzu!

00:23:06.453 --> 00:23:09.453
