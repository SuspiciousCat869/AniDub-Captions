WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.033
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V"...

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:05.700
(crowd chanting)
Unite and fight!

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.100
Unite and fight!

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.500
(Roget)
Jack Atlas is the hope
for the Commons

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.333
and the Topsiders alike.

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:14.800
But when Sergey defeats Jack,
their hero will fall.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.800
They will be looking for
a new leader to guide them...

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.600
Me.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.800
(Sergey)
Jack Atlas, you are finished!

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.600
(Melissa)
It looks like Sergey's
road wrecking

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.366
has caused the track to
reach the breaking point!

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:29.766
(Sergey groaning)

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.466
(Melissa)
<i>He's not gonna make it!</i>

00:00:31.466 --> 00:00:33.900
Whoa!Jack used his Dragon
to pull off

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.000
a heart‐thumping
midair rescue!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.800
This duel's gonna
be decided on the track.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.600
Does not compute...

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.166
Jack is enemy...

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:44.200
Enemy should not help enemy...

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.700
System overload!

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.133
Oh, I'm free!

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:51.333
Do not hold back
and come at me

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.833
with everything
in your arsenal!

00:00:53.833 --> 00:00:56.233
Get back to the plan, Sergey!

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.333
Sergey isn't your puppet
anymore.

00:00:58.333 --> 00:01:00.966
He and Jack are gonna finish
this duel their way.

00:01:00.966 --> 00:01:02.633
Now go, Archfiend!

00:01:02.633 --> 00:01:05.666
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.533
Grab him, Archfiend!

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.033
No!

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:16.333
I once again control
my own fate, Jack!

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:17.666
Farewell...

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:19.933
Until next time!

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:21.833
(Melissa)
<i>Once again, Jack Atlas,</i>

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.366
the Master of Faster,
wins the day!

00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.333
I...

00:01:27.333 --> 00:01:29.466

(Melissa)
Once again, Jack Atlas
proves he has plenty of pluck

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:36.233
and snatches victory from
the jaws of destruction!

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:38.766
For a while there, it looked
like the Master of Faster

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:40.800
would be slowed to a halt,
but the city's champion

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.033
made a turbolicious
comeback!

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:44.533
The protesters
have spread out

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:46.266
all across
New Domino City.

00:02:46.266 --> 00:02:48.233
(woman)It's hard to keep
an eye on them

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:51.000
with our limited
resources, butwe're doing our
best.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.933
(man)
They're blocking up
the streets

00:02:51.933 --> 00:02:53.433
and flooding
the city center.

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:55.066
If we don't find a way
to stop them soon,

00:02:55.066 --> 00:02:57.566
they'll take over
thewhole city.

00:02:57.566 --> 00:03:00.200
No one's taking over
my city.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.333
Now then...

00:03:03.166 --> 00:03:05.400
Attention all
Sector Security units,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:06.966
this is an emergency alert.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:08.200
(beeping)

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.433
(Roget)
The Commons are out
to cause havoc

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:13.700
to our fair city and must
be stopped immediately!

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.000
(sirens wailing)

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:22.300
Use any means necessary.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.800
(beast roaring, men groaning)

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:30.766
(Shinji)
Looks like Roget
sent out

00:03:30.766 --> 00:03:33.133
his brainwashed goons
to stop us.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.200
And their monsters
are itching for a fight.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.266
Well, you know what
I'm always saying...

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:38.866
When somebody has
an itch,

00:03:38.866 --> 00:03:40.800
the best thing to do
is scratch it!

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.366
All righty, let's do this!

00:03:43.366 --> 00:03:46.033
Time to bring it
to those bozos!

00:03:46.033 --> 00:03:47.766
I'm totally down
with that!

00:03:47.766 --> 00:03:49.266
Here goes!

00:03:49.266 --> 00:03:50.766
(creature muttering)

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.766
Security doesn't
stand a chance

00:03:52.766 --> 00:03:55.000
'cause I'm here
to bring the sting!

00:03:57.233 --> 00:03:59.100
Let's buzz 'em!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.666
Stand strong and show 'em what
we're made of!

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:04.266
Let's short circuit those
crossed up crossing guards

00:04:04.266 --> 00:04:07.266
and show Roget that his goons
are nothing but buffoons!

00:04:07.266 --> 00:04:10.066
(all cheering)

00:04:14.166 --> 00:04:17.000
Neither side
is gonna back down!

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.333
You're right.

00:04:18.333 --> 00:04:20.500
It's only gonna get bigger
and badder.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.233
If they keep fighting,
then both sides

00:04:22.233 --> 00:04:24.100
will never get back
together as one.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.100
(man 1) Hurry up!
(man 2) This way!

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.066
(man 3)
Let's move!

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.033
We'll never make
it to Declan by foot.

00:04:30.033 --> 00:04:32.400
I bet there's a hundred
battles between us

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.933
and the tower
he's holed up in!

00:04:34.933 --> 00:04:37.100
There has to be a way.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.200
There has to be a way to get
to my brother.

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:45.066
Hm... This looks like a job
for Chojiro the Hero!

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.800
When everyone sees their hero,
they'll stop fighting

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:50.600
'cause they'll be too busy
asking for my autograph.

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.766
Thank you, thank you.
Take it easy, superstar.

00:04:52.766 --> 00:04:54.200
If you go out there,
the only thing

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.200
they'll be asking for
is your next of kin.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:59.000
Think so?
I've still got star power!

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000
They'll be lined up
for hours.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.300
(men shouting)

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.533
Or not.

00:05:04.533 --> 00:05:06.033
They're all fighting.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.100
They won't stop!

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.066
(whimpering)

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:16.733
They're getting hurt!

00:05:21.666 --> 00:05:23.666
And no one's stopping them!

00:05:23.666 --> 00:05:25.400
I'll stop the fight!

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.333
Riley, no!
Kid!

00:05:26.333 --> 00:05:27.666
This is no time
to go rogue!

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.033
It's Shay!
It's Shay!

00:05:37.033 --> 00:05:38.466
Easy...

00:05:38.466 --> 00:05:40.166
You could have
gotten yourself hurt.

00:05:42.766 --> 00:05:45.400
Attention,
people of New Domino.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:48.166
The chaos you are witnessing
in our fine city is proof

00:05:48.166 --> 00:05:51.000
that theHigh Council
has failed you,

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.200
and failed to maintain
the peace.

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.466
But have no fear
as there is one person

00:05:55.466 --> 00:05:59.866
who has never
failed you...me!

00:05:59.866 --> 00:06:02.600
Therefore, I have taken it
upon myself

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:03.833
with the humblest
of humbles

00:06:03.833 --> 00:06:07.200
to be the new leader
of New Domino City.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.766
(gasps)
That rat snake!

00:06:09.766 --> 00:06:12.300
To ensure order, I have
no choice but to assume

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.100
full authority over this city
and its government.

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:17.433
And as your new leader,
I think it would be

00:06:17.433 --> 00:06:18.966
in your best interests
to declare

00:06:18.966 --> 00:06:20.833
a full lockdown
of the city.

00:06:20.833 --> 00:06:24.000
We were most foolish
to have trusted that man.

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.300
He's stolen control
of the city from us.

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:29.300
And he's convincing
the Topsiders

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:31.166
that this was
the right thing to do.

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:32.933
I would think that
was pretty clever

00:06:32.933 --> 00:06:35.300
if he wasn't against us,
that is.

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:37.900
You must have a plan
to regain control,

00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:39.633
correct, Presider?

00:06:39.633 --> 00:06:43.033
Yes.
And my plan is you, Declan.

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:47.166
I know you'll defeat Roget
and then save us all.

00:06:47.166 --> 00:06:49.200
I know you won't turn
your back on us

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:52.933
or the welfare of the city
at this crucial hour.

00:06:56.166 --> 00:06:58.333
Topsiders and Commons alike,

00:06:58.333 --> 00:07:00.133
pledge your allegiance
to me

00:07:00.133 --> 00:07:03.666
and I will maintain peace
in the city forever.

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.933
He's lying!

00:07:05.933 --> 00:07:09.166
He's using the chaos
so he can take over the city!

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:11.833
But people, both Commons
and Topsiders,

00:07:11.833 --> 00:07:14.900
you can't let him!
The city belongs to you!

00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.066
So you gotta
work together...

00:07:17.066 --> 00:07:18.533
Zuzu!

00:07:18.533 --> 00:07:20.433
...because when
you're all united,

00:07:20.433 --> 00:07:23.366
you can create a city
where everybody is happy!

00:07:23.366 --> 00:07:25.433
A city
you could be proud of.

00:07:25.433 --> 00:07:28.966
If you're not one,
you're done!

00:07:28.966 --> 00:07:32.300
Yuya, if you can hear me,
you have to convince them

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:34.833
to stop fighting
with each other.

00:07:34.833 --> 00:07:37.800
<i>I know you can do it.</i>

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.666
I think that's
why we're here...

00:07:39.666 --> 00:07:41.400
Not only to save
our own dimension

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.666
but to bring peace
toall dimensions,

00:07:43.666 --> 00:07:46.366
to show that dueltaining
is the way to achieve it!

00:07:46.366 --> 00:07:49.233
Dueltain your way
into their hearts!

00:07:49.233 --> 00:07:50.666
That's enough!
Zuzu!

00:07:52.866 --> 00:07:54.100
Easy there, fella!

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:57.133
Zuzu needs my help
and I'm going to rescue her!

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.433
That's not what
she asked you to do!

00:07:59.433 --> 00:08:02.433
I don't care what she said,
I can't just abandon her!

00:08:02.433 --> 00:08:04.766
Somebody has to
break in and free her!

00:08:04.766 --> 00:08:07.966
Gong agrees
with you 110%, pal.

00:08:07.966 --> 00:08:11.266
But Sora and Moon Shadow
are already on the job.

00:08:11.266 --> 00:08:13.266
Zuzu knew there was
only one person

00:08:13.266 --> 00:08:15.166
who could end
this craziness,

00:08:15.166 --> 00:08:16.600
and that's you!

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:19.766
(Sam)
Hey, Yuya!

00:08:19.766 --> 00:08:22.566
(panting)

00:08:22.566 --> 00:08:25.033
I thought
I'd never find you.

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:26.666
Sam, what are you
doing out here?

00:08:26.666 --> 00:08:29.000
Running as fast as I can
to get you this message

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.933
from the Master
of Faster himself.

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:32.133
Jack Atlas?

00:08:32.133 --> 00:08:33.633
Yeah.

00:08:33.633 --> 00:08:35.433
I just left him
at the Duel Palace

00:08:35.433 --> 00:08:36.933
and he wanted me
to track you down

00:08:36.933 --> 00:08:38.733
and tell you this
personally.

00:08:38.733 --> 00:08:40.166
Jack wanted me to say...

00:08:40.166 --> 00:08:43.200
(Jack)
Yuya, I give your duel with Crow
zero stars.

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.033
You battled
using brute force,

00:08:45.033 --> 00:08:47.033
without any style
or finesse.

00:08:47.033 --> 00:08:49.066
You might call yourself
a dueltainer,

00:08:49.066 --> 00:08:51.633
but there was nothing
entertaining about your duel!

00:08:51.633 --> 00:08:53.933
You couldn't even
make a clown smile.

00:08:53.933 --> 00:08:56.000
Jack doesn't pull
any punches!

00:08:57.700 --> 00:08:59.766
(Yuya)
But maybe Jack is right.

00:08:59.766 --> 00:09:03.033
That duel with Crow
was a total blur!

00:09:03.033 --> 00:09:05.066
I don't remember
much of anything.

00:09:05.066 --> 00:09:07.400
I kinda felt like I was
out of control

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:10.966
and totally forgot
about entertaining the crowd.

00:09:10.966 --> 00:09:13.633
Why did Jack want
to tell me this?

00:09:13.633 --> 00:09:17.433
Beats Gong, but we got bigger
fish to frizzle right now!

00:09:17.433 --> 00:09:19.333
Was there anything else?

00:09:19.333 --> 00:09:21.300
Just one more thing.

00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:23.600
He said to tell you
that it's never too late

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:25.666
to get back on track.

00:09:25.666 --> 00:09:28.233
I want to know
if you have what it takes!

00:09:28.233 --> 00:09:29.533
Yuya!

00:09:29.533 --> 00:09:32.533
Are you going to show how
a real dueltainer duels?

00:09:32.533 --> 00:09:36.033
Or let stage fright keep you
pacing behind the scenes?

00:09:36.033 --> 00:09:37.566
The choice is yours!

00:09:38.633 --> 00:09:40.366
Jack is right.

00:09:40.366 --> 00:09:42.700
He's saying the same thing
Zuzu said...

00:09:42.700 --> 00:09:44.533
Yuya, if you can
hear me,

00:09:44.533 --> 00:09:45.600
you have to convince them

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:48.100
to stop fighting
with each other.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:50.033
Dueltain your way
into their hearts!

00:09:50.033 --> 00:09:51.166
(Yuya)
That's right!

00:09:51.166 --> 00:09:53.400
I have to remind people
that dueling

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:55.000
is to make people happy.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.700
That's what Jack did
in his duel with Sergey.

00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:01.400
Everyone stopped fighting,
Topsiders and Commons alike.

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.066
So if I want the people
to really stop fighting,

00:10:04.066 --> 00:10:06.866
Jack and Zuzu told me
what I have to do.

00:10:06.866 --> 00:10:07.900
Huh? Yuya?

00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:09.300
Whoa‐ho!
Where're you headed now?

00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.066
I've gotta get to
the Duel Palace right away!

00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.966
We're coming with.

00:10:14.966 --> 00:10:17.200
Jack's waiting for me there
and we're gonna put on

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:20.433
the greatest dueltaining show
this city has ever seen!

00:10:20.433 --> 00:10:23.133
(Yuya)
Zuzu wants me
to swing into action

00:10:23.133 --> 00:10:25.000
and that's just what
I'm gonna do.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.066
I'm ready
to take center stage,

00:10:27.066 --> 00:10:29.733
steal the spotlight,
and wow the crowd!

00:10:30.866 --> 00:10:32.933
(Gale)
Declan, are you leaving?

00:10:32.933 --> 00:10:35.700
How dare you turn your back
on the Council!

00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:37.766
(Gray)
I thought you were going
to help us get control

00:10:37.766 --> 00:10:40.033
of the city back
from Roget!

00:10:40.033 --> 00:10:41.733
Without you fighting
for us,

00:10:41.733 --> 00:10:44.633
the city will fall
into further chaos!

00:10:44.633 --> 00:10:47.600
But worse, Roget will be
in control instead of us.

00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.066
We will be powerless.

00:10:49.066 --> 00:10:51.666
I knew we couldn't trust
him or the Lancers.

00:10:51.666 --> 00:10:53.766
They're no better
than Roget.

00:10:53.766 --> 00:10:55.366
Correct, Presider?

00:10:55.366 --> 00:10:59.900
Calm down, don't be so quick
to rush to judgment.

00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:02.900
♪

00:11:12.366 --> 00:11:15.300
Sylvio, our excursion
has not been in vain.

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:17.833
I told you I would
lead you here.

00:11:17.833 --> 00:11:20.400
Only six wrong turns,
but we made it!

00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:22.133
And Declan's inside.

00:11:22.133 --> 00:11:23.666
You'll see
your brother soon.

00:11:23.666 --> 00:11:26.700
All right.
Let's go.

00:11:26.700 --> 00:11:27.733
All we have to do

00:11:27.733 --> 00:11:29.833
is get past
their Security forces.

00:11:29.833 --> 00:11:31.133
A piece of cake!

00:11:31.133 --> 00:11:34.633
Um, make that a big,
thick piece of cake.

00:11:34.633 --> 00:11:37.633
Chojiro the Hero
will step up to the plate!

00:11:37.633 --> 00:11:39.733
While I distract them,
you, Shay, and the little one

00:11:39.733 --> 00:11:42.200
can find a way to slip inside
and find Declan.

00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.533
Huh?!
Any objections?

00:11:43.533 --> 00:11:45.800
No, then here I go!
No, wait, stop! I object!

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:47.500
You're overruled,
you're overruled!

00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:50.200
(Chojiro)
Bring it on, boys!
(laughing)

00:12:16.266 --> 00:12:17.233
Declan!

00:12:17.233 --> 00:12:19.100
Look, you guys!
He's okay!

00:12:20.733 --> 00:12:21.800
Declan!

00:12:23.533 --> 00:12:26.533
(soldiers chanting)
Declan Akaba must not escape!

00:12:26.533 --> 00:12:29.633
Declan Akaba
must not escape!

00:12:29.633 --> 00:12:32.900
Declan Akaba must not escape!

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:36.566
Declan Akaba
must not escape!

00:12:36.566 --> 00:12:39.466
Declan Akaba must not escape!

00:12:39.466 --> 00:12:41.100
(Gale)
Stop!

00:12:41.100 --> 00:12:45.600
(Gray)
We, the High Council,
are in charge, not Roget!

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:50.166
(Azul)
And we order you
to stand down immediately!

00:12:50.166 --> 00:12:53.266
(Boldo)
It seems Declan was still
on our side, Presider.

00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.700
Indeed, I knew
he wouldn't abandon us.

00:12:56.700 --> 00:12:59.500
I knew that he would
stand strong and fight for us.

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:01.000
(laughing)

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:03.633
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:13:03.633 --> 00:13:06.533
I wasn't fighting for you,
I was fighting for the people.

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.566
Roget's mind‐controlled
Security

00:13:09.566 --> 00:13:11.466
would only bring
more suffering to this city,

00:13:11.466 --> 00:13:13.366
and that's why
I had to stop them.

00:13:13.366 --> 00:13:14.833
But you, High Council,

00:13:14.833 --> 00:13:17.733
brought a different kind
of suffering to this City.

00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:20.733
Our way of ruling
was justified.

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:22.000
We know what's best

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.233
for the people
of our great metropolis.

00:13:24.233 --> 00:13:27.033
Only the all‐knowing
High Council is capable

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:28.433
of maintaining
the peace.

00:13:28.433 --> 00:13:30.133
Are we agreed,
Presider?

00:13:30.133 --> 00:13:32.866
Our ways of governing
have maintained the peace

00:13:32.866 --> 00:13:36.100
for generations here
in New Domino City.

00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.966
Yes.
Well, it looks like

00:13:37.966 --> 00:13:40.366
your policies need to be
re‐evaluated,

00:13:40.366 --> 00:13:43.566
because your city,
your great metropolis,

00:13:43.566 --> 00:13:46.666
isn't so great after all.
It was your ways

00:13:46.666 --> 00:13:49.833
that created a rift between
the Commons and Topsiders.

00:13:49.833 --> 00:13:51.433
And instead
of fixing the rift,

00:13:51.433 --> 00:13:53.600
you just ignored them
and made itlook

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:55.600
like this was peace instead
of trying

00:13:55.600 --> 00:13:57.400
to create the real thing.

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.100
And this led to anger,

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.800
which led to chaos,
which led to Roget

00:14:01.800 --> 00:14:03.500
being able to steal control.

00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.700
So maybe you should open up
your eyes,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:08.466
change your ways,
and stop making excuses

00:14:08.466 --> 00:14:10.533
and bring real peace
to everyone.

00:14:10.533 --> 00:14:12.633
So we Lancers
are still going to

00:14:12.633 --> 00:14:14.933
take down Security
and Roget,

00:14:14.933 --> 00:14:16.966
because he doesn't deserve
a free pass

00:14:16.966 --> 00:14:19.300
for how he's made
this city suffer.

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.166
But, when we restore peace
to the city,

00:14:22.166 --> 00:14:24.800
try not to make
the same mistake twice.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:27.433
(all)
Huh?

00:14:28.833 --> 00:14:30.733
Figures!
Everywhere we turn,

00:14:30.733 --> 00:14:33.733
it's the same scene
of mob versus monsters!

00:14:33.733 --> 00:14:35.433
Any other routes
to the Duel Palace?

00:14:37.633 --> 00:14:40.966
We can go this way!
It's a shortcut to a shortcut!

00:14:40.966 --> 00:14:43.433
What are you guys
doing here?

00:14:43.433 --> 00:14:46.400
Kids shouldn't be romping
around at a time like this!

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:48.366
Don't worry,
we're street smart.

00:14:48.366 --> 00:14:50.533
Relax, we know how
to avoid trouble...

00:14:50.533 --> 00:14:52.500
except for all the other
troubles we get in,

00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.833
but that doesn't
apply here.

00:14:53.833 --> 00:14:56.366
So you don't have to worry
about a thing, promise!

00:14:56.366 --> 00:14:59.333
Okay. What say
you lead the way?

00:14:59.333 --> 00:15:00.466
(Amanda)
You got it!

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.033
So, what's at
the Duel Palace?

00:15:02.033 --> 00:15:04.333
I'm gonna meet
Jack Atlas there.

00:15:04.333 --> 00:15:06.933
We'll face off in a duel
that's so entertaining

00:15:06.933 --> 00:15:08.366
it will save your city!

00:15:08.366 --> 00:15:10.133
Huh? You really think
it'll work?

00:15:10.133 --> 00:15:12.333
We better hightail it
over there!

00:15:12.333 --> 00:15:13.666
I know the way so well,

00:15:13.666 --> 00:15:15.966
I could lead you there
with my eyes closed!

00:15:15.966 --> 00:15:17.933
But I think
I'll leave them open.

00:15:17.933 --> 00:15:19.466
Hey I'm older,
I should lead!

00:15:19.466 --> 00:15:20.700
Come on!

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:23.166
You guys are the best!

00:15:23.166 --> 00:15:26.133
The only thanks we want
is for you to save our city!

00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:28.600
Yeah, and put on a great show
with Jack Atlas!

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:29.766
'Course,
it wouldn't hurt

of 'em.

00:15:45.933 --> 00:15:47.400
That's loser talk.

00:15:47.400 --> 00:15:49.566
And we Commons
are anything but that.

00:15:49.566 --> 00:15:50.833
We got this!

00:15:50.833 --> 00:15:53.200
Well, at least I think
we do.

You guys have nothing
to worry about!

00:15:54.966 --> 00:15:56.333
Huh?

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:59.800
'Cause I'm bringing some serious
air power to this tussle!

00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:03.100
Take flight and fight!
Raikiri, what do you say

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.100

With an assist from
his feathered friend!

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:31.433
With you leading us,
we'll keep this fight rolling

00:16:31.433 --> 00:16:34.066
and take control of the city
for all the Commons!

00:16:34.066 --> 00:16:36.000
Take over the city?

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.500
That's not what we should do!
What are you thinking?

00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:39.500
(all)
Huh?

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:40.900
Here's the deal:

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:44.133
Commons and Topsiders have to
stop fighting.

00:16:44.133 --> 00:16:46.000
If we want
to save our city,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.100
then both sides have to
join forces

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.300
and come together
and work as one!

00:16:51.533 --> 00:16:52.800
No thanks.

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.300
Topsiders are the worst
of the worst!

00:16:55.300 --> 00:16:57.600
They've oppressed us
for long enough!

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.533
We finally have
a chance to get revenge

00:16:59.533 --> 00:17:01.066
and we're gonna
take it!

00:17:01.066 --> 00:17:03.500
I'll never forgive
those stuck‐up creeps,

00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:05.333
and there's no way I'll ever
make friends with 'em

00:17:05.333 --> 00:17:06.533
or fight beside 'em!

00:17:06.533 --> 00:17:08.100
So, you guys
are bent on paying

00:17:08.100 --> 00:17:10.166
the Topsiders back,
no matter what.

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:11.933
Listen, I used to
think like you,

and you're wrong, too!

00:17:14.433 --> 00:17:16.233
That's how you see it...

00:17:16.233 --> 00:17:17.800
But from our viewpoint,
the only way

00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.100
to rise up is
to take the Topsiders down.

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:22.000
Maybe you should
figure out whose side

Stay behind Gong!
Gong's gonna clear a path

so that you can get yourself
to the Duel Palace.

Make sure you stay close
though, you hear?

00:18:23.066 --> 00:18:25.633
Gong's gonna bowl a strike
