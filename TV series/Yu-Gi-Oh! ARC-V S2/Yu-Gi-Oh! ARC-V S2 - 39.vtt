WEBVTT

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:04.000
(Yuya) Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! Arc‐V."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.233
(Roget)
The fools in this city
can never

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:08.800
tear their eyes away from the
Friendship Cup.

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.133
While everyone is preoccupied,
my Security forces

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.700
will teach Declan
and the High Council

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.100
the toughest of lessons.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.500
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.933
(Yuya)
In order for Roget to take over
the city,

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.200
he has to keep the High Council
locked up in their chambers.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.700
But if I can free the Council,

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.300
Roget loses all his leverage and
his scheme is foiled.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.000
(Crow)
Go save the Council
to save our future!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.733
I thought he might try
something like this.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.466
Aah!

00:00:39.466 --> 00:00:42.466
That pain
came out of nowhere.

00:00:42.466 --> 00:00:45.366
Actually, it came from
inside your helmet.

00:00:45.366 --> 00:00:48.366
I took the liberty of installing
a special chip there

00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:50.600
that can give your brain
a jolt of positrons

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.166
whenever I deem it necessary

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.966
Yuya, jump off
before it's too late!

00:00:57.533 --> 00:00:58.800
You missed your chance!

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.566
Uhh!

00:01:00.566 --> 00:01:04.333
I wonder what will happen...
at maximum strength.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.066
Aah!

00:01:09.833 --> 00:01:10.833
Uhh!

00:01:10.833 --> 00:01:12.600
Uhh!

00:01:14.733 --> 00:01:17.733
This only happens when
something's up with Yuya.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:19.200
Uhh!

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:22.300
My turn!

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:24.066
My turn!
My turn!

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:25.066
My turn!

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:27.233
(all)
I Xyz Summon!

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:31.466
(Yuya)
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon!

00:01:31.466 --> 00:01:33.266
That's Yuto's dragon!

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.166
Yuya may be on that Runner,

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:39.400
but I think someone else
is in the driver's seat!

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.400

(beeping)

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:54.233
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon,
unleash your fury!

00:02:54.233 --> 00:02:56.900
By using one Overlay Unit...

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.600
...the attack points of your
Raikira are cut in half!

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.933
And then Dark Rebellion XYZ
Dragon

00:03:01.933 --> 00:03:03.533
gains those attack points.

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:06.733
10,000 volts
of unbridled energy

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:10.866
is heading your way
to shock you into submission!

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:13.466
(all)
Your demise will soon
be at hand!

00:03:16.033 --> 00:03:19.000
Crow's Raikiri is gettin'
electrifried!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.200
And Dark Rebellion just keeps
pouring on the juice!

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.566
That Dragon's special ability
has pumped up its power

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:28.100
to a point where Crow's goose
is gonna be completely cooked!

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.333
(crowd cheering)

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.533
That Commons duelist is
completely out‐classed.

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:39.600
I do hope Yuya
finishes him quickly

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.733
so I can pick our poodle up
from the grooming spa.

00:03:41.733 --> 00:03:45.700
If Crow loses, them Topsider's
will never respect us!

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:46.966
(man)
You said it!

00:03:46.966 --> 00:03:50.533
The Topsiders will keep
treatin' us Commons like dirt!

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.766
You're free, Raikiri!

00:03:54.766 --> 00:03:57.100
I'm springing it
by activating the trap

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:58.900
Black Feather Cursed Guard!

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.033
It negates the effects of Yuya's
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon,

00:04:02.033 --> 00:04:03.933
so losing's not in my future.

00:04:03.933 --> 00:04:07.000
Ah, he's resilient.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.500
But even the toughest nut
will eventually crack

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.866
when you apply enough pressure.

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:14.300
Where is the nearest
Action Card?

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:17.100
In unit Tango Delta 6.
It's off course.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.533
Then we'll reconfigure the
track to put it "on" course.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:24.700
What's up?

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:26.900
Yuya's been talking and acting
like he's someone else.

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:31.300
Xiangke Magician, use your
Pendulum ability!

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.833
Work your wizardry
to change

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:36.366
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon's
rank into a Level.

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:47.300
(roaring)

00:04:49.366 --> 00:04:51.666
Just what in the world
are you up to?

00:04:51.666 --> 00:04:54.633
Merely setting you up
so I can knock you down.

00:04:54.633 --> 00:04:57.666
Xiansheng, fire your magic bow

00:04:57.666 --> 00:05:00.866
and set my dark designs in
motion to eliminate Crow!

00:05:04.466 --> 00:05:07.066
Dark Rebellion XYZ Dragon's
Level becomes

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:09.433
the same as Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon's.

00:05:09.433 --> 00:05:11.466
See where this
is headed, Crow?

00:05:11.466 --> 00:05:14.233
Yeah, and I'm not gonna
like it at all.

00:05:14.233 --> 00:05:15.900
There's an Xyz Summon coming!

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.333
Whoa! When Yuya Xyz Summons,

00:05:18.333 --> 00:05:21.966
you know this duel's
jumpin' to another level.

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:26.100
Adjust course point:
Lima‐Kilo 3 to Tango‐Delta
6.

00:05:36.266 --> 00:05:39.733
This path will lead you straight
to an Action Card

00:05:39.733 --> 00:05:42.700
and get rid of that birdbrain
once and for all.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.733
I overlay my Dark Rebellion
XYZ Dragon and...

00:05:46.733 --> 00:05:50.366
...my Odd‐Eyes Pendulum
Dragon to build...

00:05:50.366 --> 00:05:52.966
(all)
...the Overlay Network!

00:05:56.566 --> 00:06:00.700
Two savage Dragons meld their
awesome powers to give rise

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.800
to a monster that will send my
enemies fleeing with dread!

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.366
I Xyz Summon!

00:06:10.866 --> 00:06:13.200
Prepare to feel the wrath of
Odd‐Eyes...

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:15.500
(all)
...Rebellion Dragon!

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:17.133
Ugh!

00:06:17.133 --> 00:06:19.000
Uhh!

00:06:29.366 --> 00:06:31.100
Why isn't the track closing?

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.333
That shockwave fried
all the circuits

00:06:33.333 --> 00:06:34.833
in the surrounding area,

00:06:34.833 --> 00:06:36.633
including the track
controls, sir.

00:06:36.633 --> 00:06:39.066
It also knocked out the backup
circuits, sir.

00:06:39.066 --> 00:06:41.400
Restoring them will
take some time.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:43.333
Ugh!

00:06:43.333 --> 00:06:46.266
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon's
special ability

00:06:46.266 --> 00:06:48.833
annihilates Raikiri and deals
you damage

00:06:48.833 --> 00:06:50.966
equal to Raikiri's
attack points!

00:06:52.666 --> 00:06:55.166
Overlord Howling!

00:06:59.466 --> 00:07:01.933
Sorry, but none of
that's happening

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:05.166
'cause I'm activating the
other effect of my trap Cursed
Guard!

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:08.400
It lets me lower Raikiri's
attack points by 400

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:11.533
and reduce its Level by one to
shield it from destruction!

00:07:11.533 --> 00:07:14.300
Crow just pulled
a rabbit out of a hat!

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:15.533
Raikiri looked like a goner,

00:07:15.533 --> 00:07:17.933
but Crow's quick thinkin'
bailed his monster out!

00:07:17.933 --> 00:07:20.333
And he saved his own bacon
to boot, ya'll!

00:07:20.333 --> 00:07:22.100
Huh? Aah!

00:07:22.100 --> 00:07:24.300
I was mistaken
about the bacon!

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.300
Crow and Yuya's Duel Runners
are about to go

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:29.066
nose‐divin' off the track!

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:33.400
♪

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:35.333
Crow and Yuya's Duel Runners
are about to go

00:07:35.333 --> 00:07:38.366
nose‐divin' off the track!

00:07:38.366 --> 00:07:40.633
I'm gonna wing it
and take to the sky!

00:07:43.366 --> 00:07:45.166
I knew this duel would be an
uphill climb,

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:47.100
but I didn't mean it
literally!

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.033
Come on! Come on!

00:07:50.033 --> 00:07:52.000
I'm gonna need every last bit
of blast you got

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.533
if I wanna land this maneuver!

00:07:53.533 --> 00:07:55.500
Gimme all the juice you got!

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:57.500
Road or no road,
nothing will stop me!

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:01.200
Well, I'll be!

00:08:05.466 --> 00:08:06.833
Whoa! Yuya!

00:08:10.900 --> 00:08:12.300
Fine then!

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:16.100
I'm activating the Equip Spell
Supreme Wing

00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:20.100
And equipping it onto Odd‐Eyes
Rebellion Dragon!

00:08:21.466 --> 00:08:22.400
(roaring)

00:08:25.533 --> 00:08:27.000
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>What a relief!</i>

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.933
Now that there's some
heart‐thumpin'
entertainment!

00:08:30.933 --> 00:08:33.400
(cheering)

00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:36.100
I must admit, Crow was
impressive.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.533
(thinking)
I wonder if the track system
malfunctioned

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:40.433
or if somebody sabotaged it?

00:08:40.433 --> 00:08:42.933
I thought Yuya had maybe teamed
with the Topsiders,

00:08:42.933 --> 00:08:46.033
but that course change just now
put us both in danger.

00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.233
(wristband dinging)

00:09:01.566 --> 00:09:03.433
Oh.

00:09:03.433 --> 00:09:05.200
Huh? You're leaving?

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:07.266
Breaktime's not for
a couple hours.

00:09:07.266 --> 00:09:08.400
If they catch you
wandering off,

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:09.733
they'll put you
on mold patrol.

00:09:09.733 --> 00:09:11.700
Yuya needs me.

00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:13.933
I can't sit back and wait
for Sora to find him.

00:09:13.933 --> 00:09:15.866
I've got to help him
right now.

00:09:15.866 --> 00:09:18.866
Every second counts.
He could be in grave danger.

00:09:18.866 --> 00:09:21.133
That's the worst kind
of danger, too.

00:09:21.133 --> 00:09:23.933
Yeah. How are you
gonna get out of here
without getting caught?

00:09:23.933 --> 00:09:25.000
I don't know.

00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.466
All I do know is
it won't be easy.

00:09:27.466 --> 00:09:29.100
You can say that again.

00:09:29.100 --> 00:09:31.633
I mean, you don't have to
worry about the workers.

00:09:31.633 --> 00:09:33.133
They wouldn't rat you out
for trying to escape.

00:09:33.133 --> 00:09:35.066
But the second
you step out of here,

00:09:35.066 --> 00:09:36.433
the guards will bust you.

00:09:36.433 --> 00:09:39.233
You don't want the guards
catching you. They got cooties.

00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.200
But Yuya...

00:09:45.266 --> 00:09:47.866
We shouldn't be out
in the streets.

00:09:47.866 --> 00:09:51.500
Security will catch us
for sure out here.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.533
I'm holding you back.

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:55.100
You two should leave me.

00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.933
No, we'll never do that.

00:09:56.933 --> 00:09:58.633
I promised I'd help
rescue you.

00:09:58.633 --> 00:10:00.200
Oh!

00:10:00.200 --> 00:10:02.200
(thinking)
They are both in bad shape.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:04.433
We must find a place
to hide and rest.

00:10:04.433 --> 00:10:07.066
We cannot win a battle
if they cannot fight.

00:10:08.333 --> 00:10:10.566
Excuse me, but it appears
that the shockwave

00:10:10.566 --> 00:10:12.233
also scrambled
the chip we planted

00:10:12.233 --> 00:10:14.233
inside Yuya's helmet, sir.

00:10:14.233 --> 00:10:16.100
It's scrambled?

00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.833
Does that mean the aggression
chip no longer functions?

00:10:18.833 --> 00:10:20.966
Very much the opposite, sir.

00:10:20.966 --> 00:10:24.300
We can't turn the chip off and
its running at maximum power.

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:28.033
The brain can't withstand this
nonstop influx of positrons.

00:10:28.033 --> 00:10:29.866
It could cause severe damage,

00:10:29.866 --> 00:10:32.133
damage that cannot
be reversed.

00:10:35.366 --> 00:10:37.466
(thinking)
There is something
wrong with him.

00:10:38.666 --> 00:10:40.300
Yuya, what's your deal?

00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:42.400
Thought we were teaming to
rescue your friends?

00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:46.300
Now you're coming after me?
What gives? Answer me!

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.000
Ugghh! Aah!

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.200
Aah!

00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:50.733
You're thru!

00:10:50.733 --> 00:10:52.300
By using an Overlay Unit,

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:55.100
Odd‐Eyes Rebellion Dragon can
attack as many times

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.433
as the number of monsters it
destroyed this turn!

00:10:59.433 --> 00:11:00.966
Wait! Hold up!

00:11:00.966 --> 00:11:03.666
Your Dragon took out three
of my Blackwings this turn!

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:05.033
Very good!

00:11:05.033 --> 00:11:07.066
So my Odd‐Eyes can attack
three times!

00:11:07.066 --> 00:11:09.833
Rebellion Dragon,
prepare to attack!

00:11:09.833 --> 00:11:10.900
Take aim at...

00:11:10.900 --> 00:11:13.466
Raikiri...
...and attack!

00:11:13.466 --> 00:11:14.633
(roaring)

00:11:14.633 --> 00:11:17.466
(all)
Sweeping Static Strike!

00:11:17.466 --> 00:11:20.266
Don't think so. My trap
Cursed Guard takes effect

00:11:20.266 --> 00:11:22.900
shielding Raikiri
from destruction!

00:11:22.900 --> 00:11:25.166
(Yuya)
But you still take damage!

00:11:25.166 --> 00:11:27.800
Aah!

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:31.066
I managed to save Raikiri,
but there's was a price to pay.

00:11:31.066 --> 00:11:33.100
Because of Cursed Guard's
effect,

00:11:33.100 --> 00:11:36.700
it loses 400 attack points
and one level.

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:38.433
(Melissa, on P. A.) Crow's
keeping it interestin'!

00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:40.900
But that Dragon gets two more
attacks!

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.400
He'll have a tough time
dodging them!

00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:45.800
The positronic current's
still at maximum.

00:11:45.800 --> 00:11:49.166
Yuya cannot withstand those
levels much longer.

00:11:49.166 --> 00:11:50.466
(thinking)
That would be tragic.

00:11:50.466 --> 00:11:52.200
If Yuya is unable to continue,

00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.233
I'll have one less
pawn to play.

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:57.133
But losing a single pawn is a
relatively small price to pay

00:11:57.133 --> 00:11:58.600
to win the endgame

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.833
and clutch New Domino
in the palm of my hand.

00:12:01.833 --> 00:12:03.733
Ha! Those crowds have no idea

00:12:03.733 --> 00:12:06.366
their future is being
determined right now.

00:12:06.366 --> 00:12:10.766
By the time Yuya's duel ends,
I will rule this city.

00:12:13.066 --> 00:12:14.866
My next attack will be worse.

00:12:17.066 --> 00:12:19.900
Lock your sights on Raikiri,
The Sudden Shower!

00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:22.133
(both)
Now attack with
all of your fury!

00:12:22.133 --> 00:12:24.100
(roaring)

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.066
My Cursed Guard trap goes into
effect again!

00:12:27.066 --> 00:12:30.033
Raikiri is saved from
destruction!

00:12:30.033 --> 00:12:33.400
(groans)

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:35.133
(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>Crow hung on again,</i>

00:12:35.133 --> 00:12:37.400
but he's running awful low on
life points,

00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:40.366
and his Raikiri is growing
weaker by the minute!

00:12:40.366 --> 00:12:42.500
(thinking)
What's up with Yuya today?

00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:45.333
He's just not dueling
like he usually does.

00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:47.300
(Roget)
Well done, Yuya.

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:52.300
My takeover nears completion.

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:56.366
♪

00:12:56.366 --> 00:12:59.966

Attention all Sector Security

00:12:59.966 --> 00:13:03.000
Storm the

00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.600
Detain the Presider and

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:07.733
<i>along with Declan Akaba!</i>

00:13:07.733 --> 00:13:09.133
When they

tell them the city'sunder
new command.

00:13:16.400 --> 00:13:19.500
The security forces are
preparing to mobilize.

00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.433
They will try to depose us.

00:13:21.433 --> 00:13:23.166
This is most
worrisome indeed.

00:13:23.166 --> 00:13:25.566
No need for concern
as long as our guest

00:13:25.566 --> 00:13:27.266
continues to offer us
protection.

00:13:27.266 --> 00:13:30.500
We're counting on Declan,
aren't we, Presider?

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.966
Yes!

00:13:31.966 --> 00:13:34.366
With Declan's help,
I'm fully confident

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:38.266
we will thwart this coup
and save our fine city.

00:13:42.133 --> 00:13:44.166
(thinking)
Yuya's out of control.

00:13:44.166 --> 00:13:47.500
I wonder what I could do to try
and knock some sense into him.

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:49.433
There's gotta be a way.

00:13:49.433 --> 00:13:51.566
(all)
I will finish Crow...

00:13:51.566 --> 00:13:52.933
with my third attack!

00:13:52.933 --> 00:13:54.333
Rebellion Dragon,

00:13:54.333 --> 00:13:59.300
destroy Raikiri with
Sweeping Static Strike!

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:03.166
So not good. Cursed Guard may
have saved Raikiri again,

00:14:03.166 --> 00:14:05.433
but I'm still in bad shape!

00:14:07.233 --> 00:14:10.233
Crow's too weak to take another
life points wallopin'!

00:14:10.233 --> 00:14:12.766
If that attack had hit him,
he'd be grounded!

00:14:12.766 --> 00:14:14.666
I activate a trap!

00:14:14.666 --> 00:14:16.166
My Black Feather Hope card!

00:14:16.166 --> 00:14:17.500
(roaring)

00:14:17.500 --> 00:14:21.200
By cutting my life points
in half, I take no damage.

00:14:24.266 --> 00:14:27.200
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Once again, Crow hangs on
by a hair!

00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:28.966
He's like an old
freight train!

00:14:28.966 --> 00:14:30.833
At times it seems like he's
goin' off the rails,

00:14:30.833 --> 00:14:33.000
but he just keeps chuggin'
along!

00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.466
Why do you prolong your
inevitable demise?!

00:14:36.466 --> 00:14:38.000
(thinking)
I got it!

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:39.933
The best way to get
Yuya's attention

00:14:39.933 --> 00:14:41.933
is to take on his
Rebellion Dragon!

00:14:41.933 --> 00:14:44.066
I'll have to bring out
the most powerful monster

00:14:44.066 --> 00:14:45.833
in my whole deck
if I want a chance

00:14:45.833 --> 00:14:47.766
at taking out his Odd‐Eyes!

00:14:47.766 --> 00:14:49.100
Huh?

00:14:49.100 --> 00:14:51.133
As if things couldn't
get any worse!

00:14:51.133 --> 00:14:53.466
Obelisk Force is here!

00:14:56.333 --> 00:14:57.800
(alarm blaring)

00:14:57.800 --> 00:14:59.700
Sir, our warning system has
picked up

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.266
a number of airborne objects.

00:15:01.266 --> 00:15:04.400
There are about 20 of them
flying directly over the city.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:05.666
I have a visual.

00:15:07.500 --> 00:15:09.300
That's Obelisk Force!

00:15:09.300 --> 00:15:12.866
Duel Academy has infiltrated
the Syncro Dimension!

00:15:12.866 --> 00:15:15.333
(thinking)
They could ruin everything.

00:15:15.333 --> 00:15:19.266
Especially if they find Celina
and Zuzu before I do.

00:15:19.266 --> 00:15:21.166
This is Roget.

00:15:21.166 --> 00:15:23.900
(on P. A.)
<i>I retract my last order.</i>

00:15:23.900 --> 00:15:27.900

00:15:27.900 --> 00:15:32.700
Sergey, intercept the attackers
and show them no mercy.

00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:34.800

a beating,

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.300
but he's still hangin' on.

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:39.366
Mercy! And he ain't
the only one!

00:15:39.366 --> 00:15:41.033
Aah!

00:15:41.033 --> 00:15:42.866
How did you get up here?!

00:15:42.866 --> 00:15:44.300
Land sakes!

00:15:44.300 --> 00:15:46.700
(thinking)
If the Professor sent
Obelisk Force in,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:48.766
then I'll bet a week of
jawbreakers

00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:50.600
they're here on a special
mission.

00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:53.466
And that mission can only mean
one thing.

00:15:53.466 --> 00:15:55.433
(Yuya)
I can't just abandon Celina!

00:15:55.433 --> 00:15:57.233
What's the big deal?
Look, Yuya,

00:15:57.233 --> 00:16:00.033
Duel Academy's where Celina
originally came from,

00:16:00.033 --> 00:16:01.800
and I'm just bringing her
to where she belongs!

00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:04.966
No, I'm not doing it, Sora!
Huh?

00:16:04.966 --> 00:16:07.133
I'm not letting anybody
go there!

00:16:07.133 --> 00:16:09.600
Not Celina, not Zuzu!

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.833
(thinking)
I know Zuzu's safe
with Moonshadow,

00:16:11.833 --> 00:16:14.533
but I don't know
where Celina is.

00:16:14.533 --> 00:16:18.300
I have to help her,
but I have to help Yuya, too.

00:16:18.300 --> 00:16:21.633
What should I do?

00:16:21.633 --> 00:16:24.866
Lasso that kid up onto this
flying whirly bird!

00:16:24.866 --> 00:16:26.100
Oh!

00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:27.733
(thud)
Huh? Huh?

00:16:27.733 --> 00:16:30.566
Huh? Who the sprocket are you?

00:16:30.566 --> 00:16:32.766
I'm Sora, and I'm
a friend of Yuya's,

00:16:32.766 --> 00:16:34.100
and I'm here to help.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.233
Okay, then.

00:16:35.233 --> 00:16:37.400
Look, something's haywire
with Yuya.

00:16:37.400 --> 00:16:40.200
Your job is to bring Yuya back
around to his old self again.

00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.566
Is that understood?

00:16:41.566 --> 00:16:43.966
Look, pal, I'm a duelist,
not a psychiatrist.

00:16:43.966 --> 00:16:45.733
I'd help him myself
if I could,

00:16:45.733 --> 00:16:47.533
but another problem
just flew in.

00:16:47.533 --> 00:16:52.033
I'm gonna be super busy trying
to get to Celina before they do.

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:54.000
Before who does?

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.966
Look up there.

00:16:56.966 --> 00:16:59.066
Oh, man!
Who are they?

00:16:59.066 --> 00:17:00.533
(thinking)
He's gone?

00:17:00.533 --> 00:17:02.200
Was I imagining things?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.366
If so,
my imagination was right.

00:17:04.366 --> 00:17:07.066
Something in his head
is seriously out of whack.

00:17:07.066 --> 00:17:10.266
Yuya definitely needs help
to snap out of it.

00:17:10.266 --> 00:17:13.766
I'll have to use my cards to
knock some sense into him.

00:17:13.766 --> 00:17:17.533
Which means I have to
make every move count!

00:17:17.533 --> 00:17:18.833
I draw!

00:17:18.833 --> 00:17:20.400
Hmm.

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:22.800
Drawing this card is a definite
wake‐up call.

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:25.700
It's a sign that I have to
go for broke.

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:27.833
And there's no better card
to do that with

00:17:27.833 --> 00:17:29.233
than the Tuner Monster,

00:17:29.233 --> 00:17:31.800
Blackwing Decay The Ill Wind!

00:17:35.233 --> 00:17:36.866
(roaring)

00:17:36.866 --> 00:17:39.300
By summoning Blackwing
Decay The Ill Wind,

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.833
I'm putting everything
on the line right here.

00:17:41.833 --> 00:17:44.566
This whole duel comes down
to this one card.

00:17:44.566 --> 00:17:46.033
If it doesn't
pull through for me,

00:17:46.033 --> 00:17:47.900
I'll automatically
lose the match!

00:17:47.900 --> 00:17:49.510
It all comes down to this!

00:17:51.656 --> 00:17:53.756
♪

00:17:53.756 --> 00:17:56.889
It all comes down to the next
monster I summon out.

00:17:56.889 --> 00:17:58.322
I'll either make
a comeback with it

00:17:58.322 --> 00:18:00.222
or I'll go down in flames.

00:18:00.222 --> 00:18:02.522
'Cause I'm banking on
Ill Wind having a hand

00:18:02.522 --> 00:18:04.722
in giving Odd‐Eyes
more that it can handle!

00:18:04.722 --> 00:18:06.756
Of course before the battle
begins,

00:18:06.756 --> 00:18:08.689
my Level 4 Decay The Ill Wind

00:18:08.689 --> 00:18:11.089
has to tune my Level 3
Raikiri!

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:14.089
You've been a tough customer
tonight, Yuya,

00:18:14.089 --> 00:18:16.956
but I'm about to soften you up
real quick.

00:18:16.956 --> 00:18:18.822
I Synchro Summon!

00:18:18.822 --> 00:18:21.889
My winged warrior...
Assault Blackwing‐‐

00:18:21.889 --> 00:18:24.289
Chidori The Rain Sprinkling!

00:18:24.289 --> 00:18:27.089
I spotted somethin' foul about
that there fowl!

00:18:27.089 --> 00:18:30.022
Makes me think Crow went ahead
and messed up his turn.

00:18:30.022 --> 00:18:31.989
How in tarnation will that
feathered flyer

00:18:31.989 --> 00:18:33.589
put up a fight against Yuya's
Dragon?

00:18:33.589 --> 00:18:35.222
It's got less attack points.

00:18:35.222 --> 00:18:36.722
Hmm!

00:18:36.722 --> 00:18:40.656
(Crow)
Chidori The Light Rain gains
300 attack points

00:18:40.656 --> 00:18:43.989
for every Blackwing feather
I have in my graveyard!

00:18:43.989 --> 00:18:46.156
(roaring)

00:18:46.156 --> 00:18:48.289
There are five
in my graveyard,

00:18:48.289 --> 00:18:51.956
so that means Chidori
gains 1,500 attack points!

00:18:51.956 --> 00:18:54.289
Crow's paltry monster
just got pumped up!

00:18:54.289 --> 00:18:56.422
Now it's stronger
than Yuya's Dragon!

00:18:56.422 --> 00:18:57.889
Bring it!

00:18:57.889 --> 00:19:02.656
Chidori, amp up for a strike
at maximum power!

00:19:02.656 --> 00:19:04.356
You'll get a charge
out of this!

00:19:04.356 --> 00:19:08.689
Chidori, jog Yuya's memories!
Let 'em have it!

00:19:08.689 --> 00:19:11.056
(all)
Aah!

00:19:30.256 --> 00:19:32.256
(whooshing)

00:19:35.222 --> 00:19:38.589
Aah!

00:19:42.056 --> 00:19:43.689
Bad move, Crow!

00:19:43.689 --> 00:19:46.389
You just brought on your own
destruction with that attack!

00:19:46.389 --> 00:19:49.222
When you destroy a monster
equipped with Supreme Wing,

00:19:49.222 --> 00:19:51.089
your monster is also destroyed!

00:19:51.089 --> 00:19:52.289
No way!

00:19:52.289 --> 00:19:55.756
Yes, 'cause you take damage
equal to...

00:19:55.756 --> 00:19:58.356
...the destroyed monsters
attack points!

00:19:58.356 --> 00:20:00.589
Which is enough to wipe out
your life points.

00:20:02.622 --> 00:20:03.622
(explosion)

00:20:05.589 --> 00:20:06.589
Huh?

00:20:06.589 --> 00:20:09.456
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

00:20:11.822 --> 00:20:13.822
(groaning)

00:20:16.556 --> 00:20:19.189
(groaning)

00:20:19.189 --> 00:20:22.156
(groaning)

00:20:22.156 --> 00:20:23.989
(groaning)

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.356
Huh?

00:20:25.356 --> 00:20:26.689
(on P. A.)
<i>Yessiree!</i>

00:20:26.689 --> 00:20:28.989
Looks to me like we have us
a bona fide winner!

00:20:28.989 --> 00:20:30.856
<i>Yuya Sakaki!</i>

00:20:30.856 --> 00:20:32.656
Little fella's plum
tuckered out.

00:20:32.656 --> 00:20:37.856
Still, Yuya's won the first
duel of the semi‐finals!

00:20:37.856 --> 00:20:40.722
(wristband dinging)

00:20:47.122 --> 00:20:48.522
Huh?

00:20:48.522 --> 00:20:50.922
(dinging continues)

00:20:50.922 --> 00:20:53.056
(dinging stops)
Yuya?

00:20:53.056 --> 00:20:54.722
(Melissa, on, P. A.)
<i>Hoo‐wee, folks!</i>

00:20:54.722 --> 00:20:57.222
That duel had me glued to the
edge of my saddle!

00:20:57.222 --> 00:20:59.722
Yes, sir, the tension was as
thick as molasses!

00:20:59.722 --> 00:21:01.789
Why, it even
wore Yuya out!

00:21:01.789 --> 00:21:03.589
Of course, if he keeps
duelin' like that,

00:21:03.589 --> 00:21:07.722
Jack Atlas better keep a
tighteye on his rear‐view
mirror!

00:21:07.722 --> 00:21:09.922
Don't make me laugh.

00:21:11.589 --> 00:21:15.422
Yuya isn't close to being
in my league.

00:21:16.789 --> 00:21:18.256
(Crow)
Yuya!

00:21:18.256 --> 00:21:20.522
Come on, pal,
snap out of it.

00:21:20.522 --> 00:21:24.689
Yu‐‐ Hey! Get your claws
off me, you buzzards!

00:21:25.789 --> 00:21:27.289
Yuya, you okay?

00:21:27.289 --> 00:21:28.722
(groaning)

00:21:28.722 --> 00:21:30.256
Crow, what's going on?

00:21:30.256 --> 00:21:32.722
All right, there he is.
Thought you were
out for the count.

00:21:32.722 --> 00:21:35.089
Oh, man, I remember now!

00:21:35.089 --> 00:21:37.022
Oh, no! What have I done?!

00:21:37.022 --> 00:21:38.556
We had a plan!

00:21:38.556 --> 00:21:39.489
Just listen to me!

00:21:39.489 --> 00:21:41.022
During our duel,

00:21:41.022 --> 00:21:43.489
some flyin' folks
flew over the stadium!

00:21:43.489 --> 00:21:46.089
Sora said they were
after Celina.

00:21:46.089 --> 00:21:48.322
He went to save her,
but he'll be outnumbered.

00:21:48.322 --> 00:21:49.822
Bet he could use your help.

00:21:49.822 --> 00:21:50.822
He'll get it.

00:21:50.822 --> 00:21:54.422
Come on, you got a date
with a dumpster.

00:21:54.422 --> 00:21:55.889
Let him go!

00:21:55.889 --> 00:21:59.422
I can take care of myself!
Go help your friend Sora!

00:21:59.422 --> 00:22:00.722
Save Celina!

00:22:00.722 --> 00:22:03.989
It's my fault
you're in this mess!

00:22:03.989 --> 00:22:05.156
Please forgive me!

00:22:07.356 --> 00:22:10.356
Wait, where's Yuya
skedaddlin' off to?

00:22:10.356 --> 00:22:12.922
Shoot! That boy always
duels and dashes!

00:22:12.922 --> 00:22:15.389
(tires screeching)

00:22:15.389 --> 00:22:18.622
(thinking)
Sora was sure those guys
were after Celina,

00:22:18.622 --> 00:22:21.156
so they must've been
Obelisk Force!

00:22:21.156 --> 00:22:23.622
And if Obelisk Force is here,
the Duel Academy

00:22:23.622 --> 00:22:26.022
has started their invasion of
this Dimension!

00:22:26.022 --> 00:22:27.656
I gotta find Sora!

00:22:27.656 --> 00:22:30.056
This fight just kicked into
a whole new gear!

00:22:30.056 --> 00:22:32.056
(engine revving)
