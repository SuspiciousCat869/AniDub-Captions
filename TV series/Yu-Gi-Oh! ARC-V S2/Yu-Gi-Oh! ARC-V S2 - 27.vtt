Boy, do I miss 'em...

00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:04.133
Principal Boyle, Frederick,

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:06.233

Feels like forever ago

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.133

to these dimensional wars.

Hopefully winning
this Duel Tournament

00:00:14.733 --> 00:00:17.100
here in the Synchro Dimension
will help...

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.666

it's best to look back
on the past.

Maybe now'd be
a good time to do just that.

In order to take our stand
against Duel Academy

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.466
in the Fusion Dimension,

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.466
my friends and I journeyed here
to the Synchro Dimension.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.933
But I guess we booked
the wrong travel agent,

00:01:44.933 --> 00:01:46.100
because when we arrived,

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.566
we found out we were separated
from the others.

00:01:48.566 --> 00:01:50.766
And things only got worse.

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:54.600
We quickly ran into Synchro's
police force: Sector Security.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.633
They didn't exactly give us
a warm welcome.

The true is same in life,

so when I, Director Roget,
received word

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.166
that some duelists
had been found trespassing,

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.433
I sent my forces
to arrest them.

I did, too,

to one of our new visitors‐‐

a fact I found very intriguing.

00:02:24.766 --> 00:02:27.300

Soon, Sector Security
had us cornered.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.333
It seemed hopeless.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:30.833
That is,

on how things worked
in his city‐‐

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:46.600
how there were two ways of life:

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.600
living in the slums
or in a place called the Tops.

The people that lived there
lived in the lap of luxury.

They called all the shots
and didn't have any worries.

But the folks who lived below

neither were we...

these duelists
from another world.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.700
Naturally, I separated the girl
from the others,

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.666
for I desired
to question her personally.

00:03:25.666 --> 00:03:28.666
Her presence piqued
my curiosity.

00:03:28.666 --> 00:03:31.233
I wanted to know
where she came from.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:33.133
Why she was here.

00:03:33.133 --> 00:03:35.233
And why there are two of her.

Capturing one
proved easier than I thought,

00:03:37.433 --> 00:03:41.533
so I knew I would have
the other one in due time.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:44.000

Soon, I learned
that Sector Security

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.966
was after my lost friend Zuzu.

right in the middle of their
pathetic escape attempt.

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:17.766
We quickly reprocessed them

the elders who govern the city,

overruled my orders.

00:04:28.433 --> 00:04:31.533

Declan and his Lancers
came from their dimension,

00:04:31.533 --> 00:04:34.900
known as the Standard Dimension,
to ours.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.166
(Azul)
He made it clear that his
Lancers were on a mission

00:04:38.166 --> 00:04:42.200
to keep Fusion Dimension's Duel
Academy from attacking here.

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.666
Before, Fusion's forces
were unchecked.

00:04:45.666 --> 00:04:49.500
But now they would be challenged
by the Lancers.

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.133

Declan wanted to make
an alliance with us

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:54.166
to form a more powerful force

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:58.533
to fight back
against the Fusion Dimension.

00:04:58.533 --> 00:05:00.833
But this threat that he spoke of

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:04.833
was one that we were
already quite aware of.

00:05:04.833 --> 00:05:07.066
(Gale)
Ten years earlier,

00:05:07.066 --> 00:05:10.133
after Chojiro Tokumatsu
was locked away,

00:05:10.133 --> 00:05:12.266
our city streets
fell into chaos.

00:05:12.266 --> 00:05:15.600
The tension between Topsiders
and Commons swelled.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.533
(Gray)
And something needed to be done.

00:05:17.533 --> 00:05:21.900
The Council enacted two new
policies to maintain the peace.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.233
(Azul)
The first was to create
the Friendship Cup‐‐

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:27.033
a duel tournament
where Topsiders and Commons

00:05:27.033 --> 00:05:30.400
could come together and share
their love of dueling.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.666
(Boldo)
But that's all the sharing
that would take place.

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:36.900
For you see, the second policy
was to bolster security.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.433
To keep Commons in their place.

00:05:39.433 --> 00:05:41.400
(White)
And we were able
to accomplish this

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.300
by outfitting the security
forces with a new ARC system

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:49.466
that could create something
real, something you could feel‐‐

00:05:49.466 --> 00:05:51.466
from nothing at all.

00:05:51.466 --> 00:05:54.300
And who gave us this technology?

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.833
Why, none other
than Jean Michel Roget.

00:05:57.833 --> 00:05:59.433
And due to its success,

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:01.266
he quickly rose
through the ranks

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:04.900
and became
our Director of Security.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.466
(Gale)
We knew Roget was not
one of us‐‐

00:06:07.466 --> 00:06:10.100
that he was
from the Fusion Dimension.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.400
(Gray)
And we also knew

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.533
that there were those
from Fusion who wanted war,

00:06:13.533 --> 00:06:15.233
but all the more reason...

00:06:15.233 --> 00:06:17.000
(Azul)
To keep him close.

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.300
And besides,
none of us could dispute

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.766
that he was keeping our city
in order.

00:06:21.766 --> 00:06:24.333
(Boldo)
So when Declan Akaba appeared

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:27.233
and presented us with a new way
to stop Fusion,

00:06:27.233 --> 00:06:29.966
we weighed our options.

00:06:29.966 --> 00:06:34.300
(Gale)
Should we keep the peace
with Roget or side with Declan?

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.400
(Gray)
A spirited debate followed
on the matter...

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.600
(Azul)
If we must
make a choice,

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.633
we should choose
to be allies

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:43.966
with the side least
likely to lose.

00:06:43.966 --> 00:06:45.700
(Boldo)
Agreed, but in war

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.866
there are
too many variables.

00:06:46.866 --> 00:06:48.533
There's no telling
who might triumph.

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:50.433
There must be
another option.

00:06:50.433 --> 00:06:55.000
(White)
And there was: we simply decided
to not pick sides.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.266
We would allow Declan
and his Lancers to defend us,

00:06:58.266 --> 00:07:00.300
and if he happened to be
victorious,

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.233
we too would be victorious.

00:07:03.233 --> 00:07:06.933
However, if he and his team
failed in their endeavor,

00:07:06.933 --> 00:07:10.900
we'd still maintain
our good relations with Fusion.

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:12.333
That was the plan.

00:07:12.333 --> 00:07:15.566
But still, we knew
that no plan was perfect,

00:07:15.566 --> 00:07:19.666
especially when dealing
with a man as cunning as Roget.

00:07:37.866 --> 00:07:41.000
see if it could help
in taking Jack down,

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:44.033
way down,
once and for all.

00:07:48.933 --> 00:07:50.833
(Yuya)
My opponent
for the opening ceremony

00:07:50.833 --> 00:07:53.233
was the one and only Jack Atlas,

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:57.133
the legend of legends,
the Master of Faster.

00:07:57.133 --> 00:07:59.600
I was excited to duel him

00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.200
but insulted when he said
he could beat me in three turns!

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.000
He got in my head.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.966
Maybe that's what he was
trying to do.

00:08:05.966 --> 00:08:09.333
Because the truth is,
it did throw me off my game...

00:08:09.333 --> 00:08:12.566
and right when it mattered
most, too.

00:08:12.566 --> 00:08:13.833
Right when I was
looking to take out

00:08:13.833 --> 00:08:16.433
the last bits
of Jack's life points.

You call yourself
a Dueltainer.

Well, here's my review.

00:08:33.233 --> 00:08:34.733
Your performance
was abysmal.

00:08:34.733 --> 00:08:36.100
Mediocre at best.

00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:38.800

00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:39.800

I lost.

00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:02.500
But more than just the match.

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:04.966
I lost my confidence, too.

00:09:04.966 --> 00:09:08.233
And then I nearly lost my lunch
when Chojiro dropped by

00:09:08.233 --> 00:09:10.733
to tell me something
totally surprising

00:09:10.733 --> 00:09:12.966
and even more disturbing.

00:09:12.966 --> 00:09:15.333
He let me know that those
who lose in the Friendship Cup

00:09:15.333 --> 00:09:16.966
are sent deep underground

00:09:16.966 --> 00:09:21.400
to work in a giant trash heap
as punishment.

00:09:21.400 --> 00:09:24.766
So now there was even more
at stake in this tournament‐‐

00:09:24.766 --> 00:09:26.933
for old friends...

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:29.000
and for new.

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.200
Aah...!

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:35.833
(Yuya)
But these weren't stakes I was
willing to put up with.

00:09:35.833 --> 00:09:39.600
Seeing friends get sent
to the underground was horrible.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:41.233
I knew what I had to do!

00:09:41.233 --> 00:09:43.733
My plan was to tell the crowd
about the underground

00:09:43.733 --> 00:09:46.066
so they would learn the truth!

00:09:46.066 --> 00:09:47.966
I thought maybe
it would unite them‐‐

00:09:47.966 --> 00:09:51.500
maybe create a unified front
against this punishment.

00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:53.533
I told them
about the atrocities,

00:09:53.533 --> 00:09:55.066
but they didn't care!

00:09:55.066 --> 00:09:57.433
All they wanted to see
was destruction!

00:09:57.433 --> 00:09:59.900
The more destruction,
the happier they were!

00:10:01.833 --> 00:10:03.533
(crowd chanting)
Yuya! Yuya! Yuya!

00:10:03.533 --> 00:10:05.366
Well done!
227's a chump!

00:10:05.366 --> 00:10:08.033
He's gone for good!
You showed him!

00:10:08.033 --> 00:10:09.100
(thinking)
<i>Oh, no.</i>

00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:10.666
<i>They don't get it.</i>

00:10:10.666 --> 00:10:11.833
<i>They still don't see</i>

00:10:11.833 --> 00:10:15.166
that dueling
is supposed to be for fun.

00:10:15.166 --> 00:10:19.266
(Yuya)
I was in the dumpiest of dumps
when my fellow Lancer Moonshadow

00:10:19.266 --> 00:10:21.300
told me that all my friends
who were sent underground

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.200
were doing just fine.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.800
What a relief that was!

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:27.666
But I was still so bummed that
the people wouldn't listen to me

00:10:27.666 --> 00:10:30.433
when I told them
that they should duel for fun‐‐

00:10:30.433 --> 00:10:33.166
and that's when Moonshadow
dropped another bombshell

00:10:33.166 --> 00:10:36.600
when he gave me a message
from Riley.

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.700
(Riley)
The only way people
are going to listen to Yuya

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:41.433
is if he wins
the Friendship Cup

00:10:41.433 --> 00:10:43.833
to get the chance
to duel against Jack!

00:10:43.833 --> 00:10:47.166
And if he beats Jack, then he'll
be everyone's new hero...

00:10:48.533 --> 00:10:51.800
and they'll listen
to what he has to say.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.766
(gasps)

00:10:53.766 --> 00:10:55.133
(Yuya)
Who woulda thought
that a little kid

00:10:55.133 --> 00:10:57.600
would be the one
teaching me the lessons.

00:10:57.600 --> 00:11:00.300
And I couldn't wait to let Zuzu
know that I'm back

00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:03.533
and ready to take center stage.

00:11:03.533 --> 00:11:04.766
"Dear Zuzu,

00:11:04.766 --> 00:11:07.033
"It stinks that I can't
see you in person,

00:11:07.033 --> 00:11:09.200
"but I know
you're doing just fine.

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:11.266
"Nice duel, by the way.

00:11:11.266 --> 00:11:13.333
"You looked like a natural
on that Runner.

00:11:13.333 --> 00:11:16.200
"Maybe we can bring one
back with us when we get home!

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:19.600
"But first I have to get through
to the people of this city.

00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.166
"I hoped I could remind everyone

00:11:21.166 --> 00:11:23.800
"that dueling's
about having fun and smiling

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:25.933
"but it's hard to do
when I'm having a hard time

00:11:25.933 --> 00:11:28.900
smiling and having fun myself."

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:31.666
I promise to take
center stage, Zuzu,

00:11:31.666 --> 00:11:33.400
by winning
the Friendship Cup,

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.266
swinging the crowd my way,

00:11:35.266 --> 00:11:38.800
and bringing smiles back
to the hearts of everyone!

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:42.733
(Yuya)
But the war between Shay and
Dennis put all that on hold.

00:11:42.733 --> 00:11:47.666
Shay thought something was dodgy
with Dennis and he was right.

00:11:47.666 --> 00:11:50.733
Turns out Dennis
was from the Fusion Dimension.

00:11:50.733 --> 00:11:52.333
But that wasn't the worst of it.

00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:55.200
When Dennis told Shay
he captured his sister,

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:59.966
Shay lost it‐‐ and took out
Dennis and half the stadium.

00:11:59.966 --> 00:12:02.933
(Gale)
Where are you going?

00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:04.400
To speak with Dennis.

00:12:04.400 --> 00:12:06.333
I have... questions.

00:12:06.333 --> 00:12:11.866
Or maybe... you don't want me
to find the answers?

00:12:11.866 --> 00:12:14.833
The situation
is extremely delicate.

00:12:14.833 --> 00:12:16.766
You must understand
that our city

00:12:16.766 --> 00:12:18.866
is on the brink
of chaos.

00:12:18.866 --> 00:12:20.466
Unfortunately,
we cannot allow you

00:12:20.466 --> 00:12:22.200
to take any action

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.300
that might lead
to further disorder.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.433
It is a matter
of public safety.

00:12:26.433 --> 00:12:28.200
Isn't that right,
Presider?

00:12:28.200 --> 00:12:29.566
Indeed.

00:12:29.566 --> 00:12:31.966
We simply cannot afford
any disturbance,

00:12:31.966 --> 00:12:33.633
especially one
that might draw us

00:12:33.633 --> 00:12:35.666
into an
interdimensional war.

00:12:35.666 --> 00:12:37.266
You fools.

00:12:37.266 --> 00:12:39.500
The war isn't coming‐‐
it's already here.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:40.933
As for avoiding trouble‐‐

00:12:40.933 --> 00:12:43.333
that's just inviting trouble
to find you.

00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:45.700
Mm... so noted, Declan,

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:47.800
But on this issue
we disagree.

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.866
So far trouble
has not found us.

00:12:50.866 --> 00:12:52.933
And we plan
to keep it that way

00:12:52.933 --> 00:12:54.533
by keeping the peace‐‐

00:12:54.533 --> 00:12:57.700
and keeping Dennis
away from Roget.

00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.000
We're not comfortable

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.466
with two people from the
Fusion Dimension interacting..

00:13:02.466 --> 00:13:04.066
(groaning)

00:13:04.066 --> 00:13:05.533

Stop right there.

00:13:05.533 --> 00:13:06.400
Huh?
Huh?

00:13:06.400 --> 00:13:07.966
We'll take it from here.

00:13:07.966 --> 00:13:09.633
Dennis is coming with us.

00:13:09.633 --> 00:13:12.100
We have direct orders
from the High Council.

00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:13.700
So hand him over right now.

00:13:13.700 --> 00:13:14.866

That's not happening!

00:13:14.866 --> 00:13:15.866
(all gasp)

00:13:15.866 --> 00:13:17.766

00:13:25.766 --> 00:13:27.666
effective immediately.

00:13:27.666 --> 00:13:29.833
Therefore
your so‐called orders

00:13:29.833 --> 00:13:33.200

whatsoever.

Why would you want to
hurt my feelings like that?

00:15:25.569 --> 00:15:27.769
Because of Dennis MacField.

00:15:27.769 --> 00:15:31.169
He has ties to Duel Academy,
as do you,

00:15:31.169 --> 00:15:34.202
and we do not want him
influencing your judgment.

<i>you worry too much.</i>

00:15:38.169 --> 00:15:40.869
Yes, bringing Duel Academy
here may have been a plan
once

00:15:40.869 --> 00:15:44.436
but now
I have no such interest.

00:15:44.436 --> 00:15:48.636

they would destroy the city...

00:15:48.636 --> 00:15:52.269
after everything I've done
to consolidate my power.

00:15:52.269 --> 00:15:53.836
This city belongs to me‐‐

00:15:53.836 --> 00:15:56.169
not the High Council,
not Duel Academy.

00:15:56.169 --> 00:15:58.136

<i>Thanks to you?</i>

00:15:59.236 --> 00:16:00.336
(Azul)
<i>Meaning what?</i>

00:16:00.336 --> 00:16:03.436
Meaning I've made
this city an empire.

00:16:03.436 --> 00:16:06.036
And now I plan
to be its emperor.

00:16:06.036 --> 00:16:07.269
Emperor?

00:16:07.269 --> 00:16:08.369

Really, you should be
thanking me.

00:16:14.202 --> 00:16:17.636

than being invaded.

00:16:17.636 --> 00:16:18.802
<i>What's that old saying?</i>

00:16:18.802 --> 00:16:21.502

any different?

00:16:29.402 --> 00:16:31.802

<i>What's going to change?</i>

00:16:35.802 --> 00:16:38.936

your ARC technology,

00:16:41.369 --> 00:16:44.836
it wasn't for some
dimensional war but this?

00:16:44.836 --> 00:16:46.002
But of course.

00:16:46.002 --> 00:16:47.669
You must position your pawns
just right

00:16:47.669 --> 00:16:49.969
if you plan
to win the big game.

00:16:49.969 --> 00:16:52.802
Or in other words‐‐
take out the king.

00:16:52.802 --> 00:16:54.969
But let's not get
too far ahead ourselves.

00:16:54.969 --> 00:16:56.969
I've already had to
accelerate my plans

00:16:56.969 --> 00:16:59.002

I thought you were setting
the stage for your boss...

00:17:16.936 --> 00:17:18.536

you were just preparing
