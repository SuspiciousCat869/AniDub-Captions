(Melissa)
Folks, there's
a major scandal brewing!

00:00:05.966 --> 00:00:09.333
Yuya Sakaki has been accused
of secretly scheming with

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:12.166
none other than the organizers
of the Friendship Cup...

00:00:12.166 --> 00:00:15.233
and that could turn
this tournament topsy‐turvy!

00:00:15.233 --> 00:00:16.600
Enough with the gossip,
let's duel!

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.133
Huh?

00:00:18.133 --> 00:00:20.666

The sooner we start,

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:22.733

Scandal schmandal!

00:01:35.333 --> 00:01:36.933
Let's get dueling!

00:01:36.933 --> 00:01:40.166
Well, I always say you should
give the crowd what they want!

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:42.200
I'll get back to covering
the scandal later,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.733
but let's get
this battle a‐blazing!

00:01:46.633 --> 00:01:48.666
(Crow)
I'm the last hope
for the Commons.

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:50.300
If I don't pull out a win today,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.433
nothing will ever
change in this city!

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:55.066
(Shay)
I know there are
agents from Fusion here,

00:01:55.066 --> 00:01:57.033
but I won't be able to
find them if I lose

00:01:57.033 --> 00:01:58.866
and get sent underground!

00:01:58.866 --> 00:02:00.566
You folks all
asked for it,

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.800
and we are
gonna oblige!

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.933
Fire up the Action Field
Crossover Acceleration!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.933
(computer)
Duel Mode engaged.

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:12.766
<i>Autopilot standing by.</i>

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:14.066
(Melissa on PA)
On your marks...

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.466
<i>Get set...</i>

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.033
<i>Go!</i>

00:02:21.733 --> 00:02:23.533
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:27.166
(Melissa)
Crow and Shay have both hit
the track at full throttle!

00:02:27.166 --> 00:02:29.433
I haven't seen this much
horsepower on display

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:31.433
<i>since my rodeo days!</i>

00:02:31.433 --> 00:02:33.900
And speaking of displays,
watching this course

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.100
come to life sure
is a sight to see!

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:42.800
All righty, it's looking
like the track's good to go!

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.766
Now don't you dare think
to blink,

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:49.100
'cause this battle's gonna be
aspectacle you won't wanna
miss!

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.666
The last time Shay dueled,
he and his Raidraptors

00:02:51.666 --> 00:02:54.433
left the Duel Palace
in utter ruin.

00:02:54.433 --> 00:02:58.000
Should he jeopardize
the beauty of my future empire,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.966
he will pay dearly for it.

00:03:03.066 --> 00:03:05.900
I need to track down every
agent from Duel Academy,

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.633
and right now
you're slowing me down.

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:11.433
The only things slowing you
down are your skills.

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:15.133
(Melissa on PA)
And it's Crow by a beak
getting to go first!

00:03:15.133 --> 00:03:16.500
This is more
than just a duel!

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500
The Commons are counting on me!

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.933
I have to win, not just for
them, but for Shinji, too!

00:03:22.266 --> 00:03:23.433
It's my turn!

00:03:23.433 --> 00:03:25.900
And with it, I summon my
feathered friend

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.133
Blackwing,
Jetstream the Blue Sky!

00:03:32.066 --> 00:03:34.166
Birds of a feather like to
flock together,

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.933
so since I already have
a Blackwing flying about,

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:39.566
I can also summon Blackwing,
Oroshi the Squall!

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.566
(squawking)

00:03:45.166 --> 00:03:46.566
But it won't be staying
for long

00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:48.266
'cause I'm tuning
Oroshi the Squall

00:03:48.266 --> 00:03:50.466
with Jetstream the Blue Sky!

00:03:50.466 --> 00:03:52.700
Show 'em how we
turn the power of flight

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.900
into the power of fight!

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.400
I Synchro Summon...

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.900
Assault Blackwing,
Sayo The Rain Hider!

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:01.866
Next, I'm activating

00:04:01.866 --> 00:04:03.566
the Equip Spell
Charging Blade!

00:04:07.333 --> 00:04:10.866
And it's charging
Sayo's attack points by 800!

00:04:10.866 --> 00:04:13.133
But that's not all this
equip spell does.

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:16.966
Since I Synchro Summoned Sayo,
it deals 800 points of damage!

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:26.366
Crow gets in the first
lick of the duel!

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.566
Yes!

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:30.100
Just like my monsters
have combined into one,

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.700
if we unite we can
do anything!

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:35.066
<i>Nobody can keep us down!</i>

00:04:35.066 --> 00:04:36.800
Commons rule!

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.166
You might be up,
but not for long!

00:04:40.166 --> 00:04:42.000
Since I took damage,
I can summon

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.733
Raidraptor, Avenge Vulture!

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:48.900
You sure made the most
out of something bad.

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.533
You got the same
scrappiness that makes us

00:04:50.533 --> 00:04:52.600
Commons so unstoppable.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.500
Now I'm curious to see how you
handle the rest of this duel.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.400
I'm gonna "handle" it
by beating you

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:01.200
so I'm one step closer
to getting to Duel Academy!

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.966
I draw!

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:05.166
It's time for me to add
to my aerial assault

00:05:05.166 --> 00:05:06.333
by summoning...

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:08.066
Raidraptor, Pain Lanius!

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.166
Next, Pain Lanius' Level changes

00:05:16.166 --> 00:05:18.966
so that it's the same level
as Avenge Vulture.

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:20.900
But I have to take damage
equal to my

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:23.833
Raidraptor Avenge
Vulture's defense points.

00:05:23.833 --> 00:05:25.566
For real?

00:05:25.566 --> 00:05:27.566
But it's
no concern of mine.

00:05:27.566 --> 00:05:28.866
It's nothing more than
a peck on the neck.

00:05:30.833 --> 00:05:32.800
And once again
since I took damage,

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.066
I can summon a second
Avenge Vulture!

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.433
I get no pain, no gain,
but this is ridiculous.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:44.600
Since I have three
Raidraptors on my field,

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.166
I'm allowed to activate the
spell card Raidraptor Sanctuary!

00:05:50.833 --> 00:05:53.066
It lets me draw two cards
from my deck!

00:05:53.066 --> 00:05:54.433
It's go time!

00:05:54.433 --> 00:05:56.066
Avenge Vulture attack!

00:05:56.066 --> 00:05:57.266
Ground that Blackwing!

00:05:59.933 --> 00:06:01.533
Nothing's getting grounded!

00:06:01.533 --> 00:06:04.066
Sayo can't be destroyed
twice a turn!

00:06:04.066 --> 00:06:06.066
I can still swipe
some life points!

00:06:06.066 --> 00:06:07.633
Now, swoop on in!

00:06:07.633 --> 00:06:09.266
Sayo's still not
going anywhere.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:13.766
So far you're
0 for two, Shay!

00:06:13.766 --> 00:06:16.066
Well, you know what they say,
third time's the charm!

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:19.266
I activate
Raidraptor Rapid Xyz!

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:22.433
It lets me Xyz Summon
during battle!

00:06:22.433 --> 00:06:24.300
You mean like now?

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.566
I overlay my two Avenge Vultures

00:06:26.566 --> 00:06:29.433
and my Pain Lanius in order to
build the Overlay Network!

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.333
From the shadows, the falcon
soars on wings of courage,

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:38.133
talons ready
for the rebellion!

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.933
I Xyz Summon!

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:45.433
Witness the assent of
Raidraptor Rise Falcon!

00:06:48.133 --> 00:06:51.166
(Melissa)
That Raptor's
giving me the goose bumps!

00:06:51.166 --> 00:06:52.966
By using one Overlay Unit,

00:06:52.966 --> 00:06:54.900
it gains the attack points of
your Blackwing.

00:06:56.566 --> 00:06:59.033
So it looks like my
Rise Falcon's attack points

00:06:59.033 --> 00:07:00.733
are about to go sky high!

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:05.633
Wait a minute!

00:07:05.633 --> 00:07:08.033
You're using my monsters
to your advantage?

00:07:08.033 --> 00:07:09.166
That's right!

00:07:09.166 --> 00:07:10.800
Rise Falcon...

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.300
Attack Sayo The Rain Hider!

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:14.666
(squawking)

00:07:20.733 --> 00:07:23.633
I've grounded your game
and left you with nothing.

00:07:23.633 --> 00:07:25.666
The question is, are you
gonna cave

00:07:25.666 --> 00:07:26.800
or fight back?

00:07:28.900 --> 00:07:30.766
Oh, I'm gonna
fight back all right.

00:07:30.766 --> 00:07:33.100
My Blackwings and I are
just getting revved up,

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:34.800
so you
better watch out!

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:37.100
Yeah, for your birds
falling from the sky.

00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:39.466
Funny, Shay, but you won't be
laughing after you lose!

00:07:46.933 --> 00:07:48.033
♪

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.233
If we climb that tower,

00:07:53.233 --> 00:07:54.633
we'll have
the perfect view.

00:07:54.633 --> 00:07:57.000
Better hurry or
we're gonna miss it.

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:58.933
You're not scared
of heights, are you?

00:07:58.933 --> 00:08:00.933
How high we talking?

00:08:00.933 --> 00:08:04.500
(Security A)
Sir, we have brought
Yuya Sakaki.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:05.700
Escort him in.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:06.700
(door opening)

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:09.266
You may leave now.

00:08:09.266 --> 00:08:11.866
Yuya and I have
some matters to discuss.

00:08:11.866 --> 00:08:13.066
Yes, sir!
Yes, sir!

00:08:15.633 --> 00:08:17.500
What do you want, Roget?

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:20.366
Now, now, there's
no need to be hostile.

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:23.066
Put your mind at ease, Yuya,
I'm here as your friend.

00:08:23.066 --> 00:08:24.500
Get real, Roget.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.866
You could never
be my friend.

00:08:26.866 --> 00:08:28.933
Crow and Shay
are my real friends.

00:08:28.933 --> 00:08:30.866
Are you sure about that?

00:08:30.866 --> 00:08:33.000
After all, whoever wins
this battle

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.466
will certainly be
your next opponent.

00:08:35.466 --> 00:08:36.900
(gasping)

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:39.600
But neither of them
stands a chance.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.633
Your victory is
essential to my plans.

00:08:42.633 --> 00:08:43.800
To your plans?

00:08:45.533 --> 00:08:47.000
♪

00:08:48.466 --> 00:08:50.266
You're no
threat to me, Crow.

00:08:50.266 --> 00:08:51.866
I've faced hordes
of soldiers

00:08:51.866 --> 00:08:53.866
who went after my
people for the fun of it!

00:08:53.866 --> 00:08:55.166
Compared to those creeps,

00:08:55.166 --> 00:08:56.533
you're nothing
but a lightweight!

00:08:56.533 --> 00:08:57.866
Talk all you want,

00:08:57.866 --> 00:08:59.666
but you'll learn soon
enough that us Commons

00:08:59.666 --> 00:09:02.133
are a lot tougher
than you think...

00:09:02.133 --> 00:09:03.166
and I'm gonna
prove it!

00:09:04.433 --> 00:09:05.500
Check this out!

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.733
I'm summoning...

00:09:06.733 --> 00:09:08.766
Blackwing, Tornado
the Reverse Wind!

00:09:10.266 --> 00:09:11.900
(squawking)

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.800
And its special ability
is gonna blow you away!

00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:17.766
It lets me summon a Tuner
monster from my graveyard!

00:09:17.766 --> 00:09:20.400
So welcome back,
Oroshi the Squall!

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.433
Oroshi the Squall tunes
Tornado the Reverse Wind!

00:09:26.166 --> 00:09:27.666
There's a storm coming,

00:09:27.666 --> 00:09:29.733
and with it comes
a deluge of destruction!

00:09:31.533 --> 00:09:33.566
I Synchro Summon!

00:09:33.566 --> 00:09:36.633
Assault Blackwing,
Sohaya the Rain Storm!

00:09:39.333 --> 00:09:41.600
Since I Synchro Summoned Sohaya,

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:43.033
I can now
bring back another

00:09:43.033 --> 00:09:46.033
Assault Blackwing from
my graveyard!

00:09:46.033 --> 00:09:48.400
Come...
Sayo The Rain Hider!

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:51.866
And when it rains,
boy, does it pour!

00:09:51.866 --> 00:09:54.700
Sayo the Rain Hider counts
as a Tuner Monster,

00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.900
and that means that I can
Synchro Summon one more time.

00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:59.166
That can't be!

00:09:59.166 --> 00:10:00.633
Afraid so!

00:10:00.633 --> 00:10:03.500
And the forecast for this duel
is about to get even worse!

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.900
I'm unleashing
a storm of trouble!

00:10:05.900 --> 00:10:07.766
I Synchro Summon!

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:09.833
The turbulent
Assault Blackwing,

00:10:09.833 --> 00:10:12.033
Raikiri the Rain Shower!

00:10:12.033 --> 00:10:13.533
Yee‐haw!

00:10:13.533 --> 00:10:17.433
That was one awe‐inspiring
display of Synchronization!

00:10:17.433 --> 00:10:20.333
Raikiri's special ability
activates!

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:22.033
For each Blackwing on my field,

00:10:22.033 --> 00:10:24.033
Raikiri can destroy
one of your cards!

00:10:25.666 --> 00:10:27.466
Your Rise Falcon
is a goner, Shay!

00:10:29.566 --> 00:10:31.000
(Shay)
Or is it?

00:10:36.666 --> 00:10:39.433
I play the Action Spell
I picked up!

00:10:39.433 --> 00:10:42.400
Mirror Barrier will keep
Rise Falcon safe and sound!

00:10:45.666 --> 00:10:47.333
Only for the time being!

00:10:47.333 --> 00:10:49.233
'Cause now Raikiri
attacks Rise Falcon!

00:10:50.466 --> 00:10:51.800
(yelling)

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:54.933
By sending Raidraptor Booster
Strix to the graveyard,

00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:57.400
Rise Falcon can
use one Overlay Unit

00:10:57.400 --> 00:10:59.233
to rocket itself out
of harm's way!

00:11:09.066 --> 00:11:11.133
That thing
just went supersonic!

00:11:11.133 --> 00:11:14.433
And by using another one of
Rise Falcon's Overlay Units,

00:11:14.433 --> 00:11:17.200
it can take out the monster
that tried to attack it!

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.833
So your
Raikiri is history!

00:11:23.966 --> 00:11:25.266
I don't think so!

00:11:25.266 --> 00:11:27.266
'Cause I play
the trap Blade Shade!

00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:31.733
It shades Raikiri
from being destroyed!

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.500
But I can't say the same
thing for your life points,

00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:39.900
'cause Blade Shade's
about to hit you

00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:41.666
with 500 points of damage!

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.466
Your move.

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:47.833
But you gotta
face facts, Shay,

00:11:47.833 --> 00:11:49.300
I've got the upper hand

00:11:49.300 --> 00:11:52.333
and your aerial assault can
barely get off the ground.

00:11:52.333 --> 00:11:54.633
I might be down,
but I'll rise up.

00:11:54.633 --> 00:11:56.866
My home was destroyed,
my friends captured...

00:11:56.866 --> 00:11:59.200
but that didn't
break me or my spirit.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:01.233
It only made me
stronger...

00:12:01.233 --> 00:12:02.933
and that's
bad news for you!

00:12:02.933 --> 00:12:04.833
(Yuya)
What's this plan
you were talking about?

00:12:04.833 --> 00:12:06.400
And why am I involved?

00:12:06.400 --> 00:12:08.933
Very soon, I will
rule over this city.

00:12:08.933 --> 00:12:12.266
In fact, I have already
begun to take control.

00:12:12.266 --> 00:12:13.866
Declan!
Riley!

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:15.533
You rat!

00:12:15.533 --> 00:12:17.466
Your friends
are safe for now.

00:12:17.466 --> 00:12:20.500
I promise no harm
will come to them.

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:23.066
But that guarantee requires
your cooperation.

00:12:27.833 --> 00:12:29.333
Hey, Shay,
what kind of turkey

00:12:29.333 --> 00:12:31.366
you planning to summon
this time?

00:12:31.366 --> 00:12:33.933
Or maybe you're looking at
bringing out a lame duck?

00:12:33.933 --> 00:12:35.300
Either way, we both know

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.700
that any move you're
planning to make

00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.733
is certainly
gonna be for the birds.

00:12:38.733 --> 00:12:40.333
So bring it on!

00:12:40.333 --> 00:12:42.233
Keep flapping your lips...

00:12:42.233 --> 00:12:44.200
'cause it'll be that much
sweeter when I shut them!

00:12:45.733 --> 00:12:47.466
(Amanda)
They're heading this way!

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:50.566
You sure talk a good game,
Crow, but talk is cheap.

00:12:50.566 --> 00:12:53.033
It's time to
put up or shut up.

00:12:53.033 --> 00:12:54.866
Crow!
Max it out!

00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.800
(Jean Michel)
This so‐called "duel"
is a travesty,

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:03.600
quite unlike the battles
you have fought.

00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:05.200
With Jack Atlas,

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:07.600
Officer 227
and Shinji Weber.

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:11.333
Your duels against them
were fascinating.

00:13:11.333 --> 00:13:13.133
Watching you taught
me an important lesson.

00:13:15.033 --> 00:13:17.733
I always believed the point of
dueling was to defeat one's

00:13:17.733 --> 00:13:20.400
opponent with
overwhelming force.

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.100
But I see what you are
trying to do

00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:25.200
and it has opened
my eyes to new possibilities.

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:27.033
When you battle, you're
actually hoping to

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:29.966
communicate something
greater to the spectators.

00:13:29.966 --> 00:13:32.666
I know that you want to
entertain the crowd,

00:13:32.666 --> 00:13:34.900
Topsiders and Commons alike

00:13:34.900 --> 00:13:37.233
through the spirit of
dueltaining.

00:13:37.233 --> 00:13:39.200
Because why fight
when you can smile?

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:40.866
That's the point.

00:13:40.866 --> 00:13:43.866
When I duel, it's to
make people smile.

00:13:43.866 --> 00:13:46.233
What a wonderful
sentiment.

00:13:46.233 --> 00:13:47.633
Your dueltainer philosophy

00:13:47.633 --> 00:13:49.900
is exactly what
this city needs

00:13:49.900 --> 00:13:53.000
to heal its divisions
and bring everyone together!

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:55.900
Of course, your exhibition duel
against Jack Atlas

00:13:55.900 --> 00:13:57.933
didn't go as well
as you had hoped.

00:13:57.933 --> 00:14:00.666
Your lack of experience with
Turbo Dueling may have

00:14:00.666 --> 00:14:03.900
contributed to
your unfortunate defeat.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:05.466
But since then your skills

00:14:05.466 --> 00:14:07.900
have improved
by leaps and bounds!

00:14:07.900 --> 00:14:10.600
All I ask is that you
keep competing.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.833
Continue dueltaining
with all your heart.

00:14:12.833 --> 00:14:15.900
By doing so, you will bring
smiles to our hearts as well.

00:14:18.766 --> 00:14:21.100
It is the only hope
for our fair city.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:22.600
I am fully confident

00:14:22.600 --> 00:14:25.200
that you will unify
Topsiders and Commons

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.533
and bring us peace!

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:29.800
♪

00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:31.800
I hope Crow
takes this guy down!

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.333
What a meanie!

00:14:33.333 --> 00:14:34.933
More like a maniac!

00:14:34.933 --> 00:14:37.333
He knocked his last opponent
into next week.

00:14:37.333 --> 00:14:38.933
Well, Crow's gonna
show 'em what it's like

00:14:38.933 --> 00:14:40.366
to be bird food!

00:14:40.366 --> 00:14:42.066
I know Shay
seems like a meanie,

00:14:42.066 --> 00:14:44.533
but you'd be mad too if
everything you had

00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:46.166
was taken
away from you.

00:14:46.166 --> 00:14:49.033
Yeah, well,
that's no excuse.

00:14:49.033 --> 00:14:52.266
We're not mean and we never
had anything to begin with!

00:14:52.266 --> 00:14:55.133
And unlike Shay, I always
play by the rules...

00:14:57.900 --> 00:14:59.300
... except for the times
that I don't,

00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.300
which is all the time.

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:03.666
But whenever Crow
caught us doing something

00:15:03.666 --> 00:15:05.100
he thought was wrong,

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:06.900
he'd always
set us straight.

00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:09.466
Crow promised us things
would get better.

00:15:09.466 --> 00:15:11.966
And Crow always
keeps his promise.

00:15:11.966 --> 00:15:13.766
So when he wins
the Friendship Cup,

00:15:13.766 --> 00:15:14.800
everything's gonna
be great!

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.866
(Jean Michel)
My dream is to bring
peace and order

00:15:18.866 --> 00:15:20.233
back to this city,

00:15:20.233 --> 00:15:22.300
and eventually
to our whole world!

00:15:22.300 --> 00:15:25.333
I know that it won't be
easy, but I must try.

00:15:25.333 --> 00:15:28.633
If I can unite
the Topsiders and Commons,

00:15:28.633 --> 00:15:30.433
it will be the first step
toward a brighter

00:15:30.433 --> 00:15:32.433
and more hopeful future!

00:15:32.433 --> 00:15:35.000
Will you help me make
this dream a reality?

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:36.300
I realize
it won't be easy,

00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.533
but with your skills

00:15:37.533 --> 00:15:39.500
and the resources
at my disposal,

00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:42.400
I feel certain that
we will succeed in time.

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:43.700
The first step
is clear.

00:15:43.700 --> 00:15:46.366
You must
defeat Jack Atlas...

00:15:46.366 --> 00:15:48.166
and then lay claim to
the Friendship Cup.

00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:53.800
This city needs an
honorable champion.

00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:56.333
Unlike Jack Atlas,
you have integrity.

00:15:56.333 --> 00:15:58.633
Once you take your place
on his throne,

00:15:58.633 --> 00:16:01.233
we can begin to change
this world for the better.

00:16:01.233 --> 00:16:02.800
If you're so keen
on working with me,

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:03.900
then what was with
the ambush?

00:16:05.833 --> 00:16:07.000
You must understand

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.566
it was done for
your own protection.

00:16:09.566 --> 00:16:12.400
Your goons ever hear
of the word "please"?

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.633
They thought you were
conspiring with

00:16:13.633 --> 00:16:16.000
an outsider who's been
lurking around the city.

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.933
Wait, you mean Sora?

00:16:17.933 --> 00:16:19.033
Sora?

00:16:19.033 --> 00:16:21.233
Oh, is that the name of
the blue‐haired boy?

00:16:21.233 --> 00:16:23.000
What do you
want him for?

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:24.500
After careful
surveillance,

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.766
I've determined
that his presence

00:16:25.766 --> 00:16:27.166
cannot be tolerated

00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:29.500
because it is
a threat to this city.

00:16:29.500 --> 00:16:31.233
He's from Duel Academy,

00:16:31.233 --> 00:16:33.800
so he's the enemy,
right?

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:34.800
You can't trust him.

00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.666
It's true, but...

00:16:37.666 --> 00:16:39.766
Sora is a good
friend of mine.

00:16:39.766 --> 00:16:41.633
He's not a threat
to this city.

00:16:41.633 --> 00:16:43.033
He's not
a threat to anybody.

00:16:43.033 --> 00:16:44.300
He's here to help.

00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:46.733
How foolish of you
to take him at his word.

00:16:46.733 --> 00:16:49.433
Members of Duel Academy
have no friends.

00:16:49.433 --> 00:16:52.200
Their lives are dedicated
to one person alone...

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.766
to the Professor.

00:16:54.966 --> 00:16:56.300
We have to obey
the Professor's

00:16:56.300 --> 00:16:58.433
orders no matter what.

00:16:58.433 --> 00:17:00.700
That's the Duel Academy
rule.

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:04.966
Trust me Yuya.

00:17:04.966 --> 00:17:07.466
Your "friend" Sora
will betray you.

00:17:07.466 --> 00:17:09.700
I know this from experience.

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:13.233
Just like Sora, I too am
from the Fusion Dimension.

00:17:18.566 --> 00:17:20.233
♪

00:17:25.633 --> 00:17:26.866
(Sora)
Figures.

00:17:26.866 --> 00:17:28.833
Just when I need to
reach Zuzu in a hurry,

00:17:28.833 --> 00:17:31.033
they wrap the whole city
in a security blanket!

00:17:37.933 --> 00:17:39.833
Time to take
to the skies!

00:17:39.833 --> 00:17:41.500
And unleash all
my might!

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:42.800
Now it's my turn!

00:17:44.766 --> 00:17:46.000
Here I go.

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.800
I activate the spell
Rank‐Up‐Magic Raid Force!

00:17:50.966 --> 00:17:54.433
I overlay Raid Raptor Rise
Falcon to Xyz Summon

00:17:54.433 --> 00:17:56.800
another Raid Raptor
that's one Rank higher!

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.200
This can't be good.

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:05.166
(Shay)
Terror of the skies,
predator of blazing force,

00:18:05.166 --> 00:18:07.933
with wings that slash,
and talons that tear...

00:18:10.933 --> 00:18:13.866
Go Rank Up Xyz Evolution!

00:18:13.866 --> 00:18:16.900
Rise up,
Raidraptor Blaze Falcon!

00:18:19.066 --> 00:18:22.666
By using one Overlay Unit
Blaze Falcon's special ability

00:18:22.666 --> 00:18:26.200
destroys your monster, and deals
you 500 points of damage.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.766
But thanks to my
trap Blade Shade,

00:18:31.766 --> 00:18:33.166
Raikiri The Rain Shower

00:18:33.166 --> 00:18:34.866
is protected from
being destroyed!

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:40.466
You do know that if
you keep this up, Shay,

00:18:40.466 --> 00:18:41.700
you're totally
gonna end up

00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:43.133
winning the duel for me.

00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:49.633
(Crow)
There's gotta be more to
Shay's game than meets the eye.

00:18:49.633 --> 00:18:52.466
And now Blaze Falcon...
attack Crow directly!

00:18:55.166 --> 00:18:56.100
Huh?

00:18:56.100 --> 00:18:57.333
(screaming)

00:18:59.733 --> 00:19:01.900
When Blaze Falcon
deals you damage,

00:19:01.900 --> 00:19:03.700
it also gets to destroy
your monster.

00:19:07.866 --> 00:19:09.233
(yelling)

00:19:10.733 --> 00:19:12.333
That's a double whammy!

00:19:12.333 --> 00:19:15.266
Since Raikiri is gone,
Blade Shade is also destroyed.

00:19:17.633 --> 00:19:20.233
With that, I'll play two
face‐downs and end my turn!

00:19:21.700 --> 00:19:25.366
(Melissa)Folks, Shay Obsidian
is dueling with the ferocity

00:19:25.366 --> 00:19:27.300
<i>of an enraged raptor!</i>

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.033
Crow better pick up
his game quick,

00:19:29.033 --> 00:19:31.166
or his
Duel Running days are over!

00:19:34.466 --> 00:19:36.166
(Jean Michel)
I was sent here by
Duel Academy

00:19:36.166 --> 00:19:38.800
to prepare this
city for invasion.

00:19:38.800 --> 00:19:40.600
But while I carried out
my mission,

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:43.100
I began to love
this world and its people.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:44.833
My only goal now is
to help the city

00:19:44.833 --> 00:19:46.100
overcome its divisions

00:19:46.100 --> 00:19:48.233
so that everyone
can live in peace.

00:19:48.233 --> 00:19:50.333
But I can't achieve
this vision alone.

00:19:50.333 --> 00:19:52.500
I need your help.

00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:54.333
Join forces
with me, Yuya,

00:19:54.333 --> 00:19:56.266
and together we will
rule this city.

00:19:57.733 --> 00:19:59.266
The choice is yours.
