(Melissa, on P. A.)
<i>Howdy, folks!</i>

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.166
Welcome to the opening
ceremonies of
The Friendship Cup!

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:15.100
Give it up for the Master of
Faster, Jack Atlas!

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:16.600
Our hometown hero is here
and ready

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.500
to duel in an
exhibition match!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.566
Entering stage left is the
dueltaining challenger,

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.066
Yuya Sakaki!

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:24.400
Can it be?

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.233
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:30.033
I'm taking control of
this duel, starting now!

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:33.433
Turn up the heat, Odd‐Eyes
Pendulum Dragon!

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.500
(roaring)

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.400
I fuse Performapaltrump Girl and
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.933
Taking center stage,
the one, the only...

00:00:42.933 --> 00:00:46.000
Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.700
I Xyz Summon!

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.133
Rank 4 Dark Rebellion Xyz
Dragon!

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:56.800
Three new summoning methods?

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.766
This is something my eyes
have never seen before.

00:00:59.766 --> 00:01:02.033
I Synchro Summon!

00:01:02.033 --> 00:01:05.866
Now rise, Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:01:05.866 --> 00:01:09.733
Feel the heat, Yuya, of your
impending demise!

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.533
And now, Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:18.200
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.900
Aah!

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.533
Yuya!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.833

That was quite the victory
Jack Atlas lassoed in!

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.766
That battle was hotter than a
chili pepper milk shake

00:02:36.766 --> 00:02:38.533
with hot sauce!

00:02:38.533 --> 00:02:40.400
(girl)
You ruled that duel!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.433
(boy)
That Yuya had no chance!

00:02:42.433 --> 00:02:44.433
(boy #2)
Scarlet Dragon Archfiend
is the coolest!

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:46.133
(boy #3)
That's how it's done, Jack!

00:02:46.133 --> 00:02:47.900
(boy #4)
You lapped that lap dog!
Ha ha!

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.766
Yes!
Jack Atlas is the man!

00:03:06.766 --> 00:03:09.466
Right, Zuzu?

00:03:09.466 --> 00:03:11.433
Yuya!
Guess not.

00:03:11.433 --> 00:03:12.933
Yuya!

00:03:12.933 --> 00:03:15.533
Yes, sir. Moving in.

00:03:17.566 --> 00:03:18.833
Excuse me, please!

00:03:18.833 --> 00:03:21.866
I have to get down there!
He needs me!

00:03:21.866 --> 00:03:23.200
Yuya!

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.733
I lost.

00:03:29.733 --> 00:03:33.333
Jack said he would beat me,
and he was right.

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:36.933
My best wasn't good enough.

00:03:36.933 --> 00:03:38.400
Huh?

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.966
Yuya!
Yuya!

00:03:39.966 --> 00:03:42.166
So out of shape.

00:03:42.166 --> 00:03:44.133
Zuzu, don't burst
a blood vessel!

00:03:44.133 --> 00:03:45.633
He'll be fine!

00:03:45.633 --> 00:03:47.900
He took that landing
like a champ.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:53.566
Get your hands off me!

00:03:55.166 --> 00:03:58.233
Lay off the threads!
We're VIPs!

00:03:58.233 --> 00:04:00.500
I think you top hats
better back off

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.066
or there's gonna be trouble.

00:04:02.066 --> 00:04:03.500
(Security)
You're already in trouble.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:06.600
We're Sector Security,
and you're under arrest.

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:22.762
You two got a date at
the Facility.

00:04:24.829 --> 00:04:26.029
Stand down.

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:28.295
We act under strict orders from
the High Council

00:04:28.295 --> 00:04:31.462
to place these two individuals
under our direct supervision.

00:04:31.462 --> 00:04:34.629
And their orders outrank yours,
Sector Security.

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:38.362
What does the High Council
want with us?

00:04:39.929 --> 00:04:42.329
Blast those
meddling old fools.

00:04:42.329 --> 00:04:44.562
They will pay!

00:04:46.329 --> 00:04:49.295
We apologize for Sector
Security's rash behavior.

00:04:49.295 --> 00:04:51.229
You two are now under
the watchful eye

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:52.495
of the High Council.

00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:54.862
We'll escort you to your
quarters now.

00:04:54.862 --> 00:04:58.662
I'm not going anywhere until
you tell me how Yuya is!

00:04:58.662 --> 00:05:00.095
Don't worry.

00:05:00.095 --> 00:05:03.529
We take good care of all
Friendship Cup competitors.

00:05:14.962 --> 00:05:17.929
(groaning)

00:05:17.929 --> 00:05:21.162
Feels like I got hit with
a hammer.

00:05:21.162 --> 00:05:23.629
More like a "Jack" hammer.

00:05:23.629 --> 00:05:25.362
Man.

00:05:25.362 --> 00:05:27.395
How embarrassing.

00:05:27.395 --> 00:05:28.662
I gotta step up my game

00:05:28.662 --> 00:05:31.195
if I don't want to get
stepped on again.

00:05:31.195 --> 00:05:34.962
I mean,
I got crushed in the end.

00:05:34.962 --> 00:05:36.995
Aah!

00:05:36.995 --> 00:05:39.862
Jack beat me like it was
nothing.

00:05:51.595 --> 00:05:52.662
Huh?

00:05:52.662 --> 00:05:54.762
I don't know how I got here,

00:05:54.762 --> 00:05:57.195
but someone deserves a tip
for this ocean view.

00:05:57.195 --> 00:05:59.095
A thank you will suffice.

00:05:59.095 --> 00:06:00.562
Huh?

00:06:00.562 --> 00:06:02.729
Oh, please forgive me, Yuya.

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:05.395
It wasn't my intention to
startle you.

00:06:05.395 --> 00:06:07.795
A knock would have
been nice!

00:06:07.795 --> 00:06:09.362
Hey, your all see‐through.

00:06:09.362 --> 00:06:11.095
(chuckles)

00:06:11.095 --> 00:06:13.695
That's because we're all
holographic projections.

00:06:13.695 --> 00:06:16.195
We're not technically here,
I'm afraid.

00:06:16.195 --> 00:06:18.962
But we can all see you
and speak with you.

00:06:18.962 --> 00:06:20.862
We keep a close eye on
all the competitors

00:06:20.862 --> 00:06:22.329
in the Friendship Cup.

00:06:22.329 --> 00:06:25.262
We want to make sure that all
the guests are comfortable,

00:06:25.262 --> 00:06:28.095
So that they may focus on
preparing for their duels,

00:06:28.095 --> 00:06:30.162
correct, Presider?
Correct.

00:06:30.162 --> 00:06:33.095
You are in the penthouse
located at the very top

00:06:33.095 --> 00:06:35.695
of the High Council's
headquarters.

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.395
I'm sure you'll find our
accommodations here

00:06:38.395 --> 00:06:43.729
surpass those of even the most
luxurious 5‐star hotels.

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:45.795
It seems nice, I guess.

00:06:45.795 --> 00:06:48.329
But where are all
my friends staying?

00:06:48.329 --> 00:06:50.195
They are here as well.

00:06:50.195 --> 00:06:51.529
Safe and sound.

00:06:51.529 --> 00:06:54.262
(Azul) All of the 16 Friendship
Cup participants

00:06:54.262 --> 00:06:56.629
will enjoy the same
amenities as you

00:06:56.629 --> 00:06:58.229
for the duration of the
tournament.

00:06:58.229 --> 00:07:00.762
(Boldo) However, you may only
remain in the lap of luxury

00:07:00.762 --> 00:07:02.595
as long as you're in the
tournament.

00:07:02.595 --> 00:07:05.262
(Azul)
If you lose, you will
be removed at once.

00:07:05.262 --> 00:07:09.162
Guess that means I should pack
my bags since I lost to Jack.

00:07:09.162 --> 00:07:12.329
(Boldo)
Your duel with Jack Atlas
was an exhibition match,

00:07:12.329 --> 00:07:16.129
not a tournament match,
isn't that right, Presider?

00:07:16.129 --> 00:07:20.029
Yes. So for now, at least,
this is still your home.

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:23.029
Next time, if you lose,
you must leave.

00:07:23.029 --> 00:07:25.395
So I suggest you start
winning, young man,

00:07:25.395 --> 00:07:27.662
Losing appeals
to no one.

00:07:27.662 --> 00:07:30.295
Be smart and prepare yourself
for your next match.

00:07:30.295 --> 00:07:32.629
It could be your last.

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:36.995
Huh? Wait!
I need to ask about Zuzu.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:40.195
If Zuzu's gonna duel in
the Friendship Cup,

00:07:40.195 --> 00:07:43.829
she must be in this building
somewhere, too.

00:07:49.195 --> 00:07:50.695
It won't open.

00:07:50.695 --> 00:07:52.429
(grunting)

00:07:52.429 --> 00:07:55.662
Hey! Come on! I'm locked
in here! Let me out!

00:07:55.662 --> 00:07:58.595
Hello?
Is anybody there?

00:07:58.595 --> 00:08:00.929
Let me outta here!

00:08:11.795 --> 00:08:14.228
(Gale) We have decided that you
will remain here

00:08:14.228 --> 00:08:16.328
with the rest of the Lancers.

00:08:16.328 --> 00:08:18.495
(Gray)
As you are aware,
Director Roget

00:08:18.495 --> 00:08:21.428
looks upon you as a possible
threat to our city.

00:08:21.428 --> 00:08:23.628
As long as you are under our
supervision,

00:08:23.628 --> 00:08:26.228
security has no jurisdiction
within these walls.

00:08:26.228 --> 00:08:28.961
The Friendship Cup
cannot be compromised.

00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:30.528
Isn't that right, Presider?

00:08:30.528 --> 00:08:31.795
Yes.

00:08:31.795 --> 00:08:34.561
While you may find our facility
a wee bit cramped,

00:08:34.561 --> 00:08:36.661
since you are not competing
feel free

00:08:36.661 --> 00:08:39.261
to move about as you wish in
this building.

00:08:39.261 --> 00:08:41.261
I thank you for your
hospitality.

00:08:41.261 --> 00:08:44.128
I, too, am concerned about
the tournament.

00:08:44.128 --> 00:08:46.695
The last thing I would want to
happen is for the Lancers

00:08:46.695 --> 00:08:49.528
to not be able to prove
themselves worthy.

00:08:55.428 --> 00:08:57.295
(buzzing)
Huh?

00:08:57.295 --> 00:08:58.861
Huh?

00:09:01.761 --> 00:09:05.095
Ah! Now this is living!

00:09:05.095 --> 00:09:07.528
I wonder what the thread count
is for these sheets.

00:09:07.528 --> 00:09:09.095
They're unbelievable.

00:09:09.095 --> 00:09:12.561
I could really
get used to this.

00:09:15.095 --> 00:09:19.495
My Odd‐Eyes and Yuto's Dark
Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:09:20.795 --> 00:09:23.228
Ever since I dueled Yuto,

00:09:23.228 --> 00:09:26.095
I felt like these dragons were
drawn to each other,

00:09:26.095 --> 00:09:28.928
like there was some form of
connection between them.

00:09:28.928 --> 00:09:30.995
I mean, it couldn't be a
coincidence

00:09:30.995 --> 00:09:35.061
that Yugo's Clear Wing Synchro
Dragon showed up, too, could it?

00:09:35.061 --> 00:09:37.128
Can it be that
these two dragons

00:09:37.128 --> 00:09:39.328
are sensing Yugo's dragon
right now?

00:09:39.328 --> 00:09:43.195
So if Yugo's nearby, then Zuzu
must be, too!

00:09:43.195 --> 00:09:45.261
Zuzu, it's me, Yuya!

00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:46.895
Can you hear me?!

00:09:46.895 --> 00:09:50.261
I've travelled a gazillion
miles to find you and bring you
home!

00:09:50.261 --> 00:09:52.795
And I'm not alone,
your friends came, too!

00:09:52.795 --> 00:09:55.061
Gong's here and so is Dennis.

00:09:55.061 --> 00:09:56.361
And Celina came with us,

00:09:56.361 --> 00:09:59.195
even though she's been a
grumplepants!

00:09:59.195 --> 00:10:02.761
Your dad, Frederick, Ally,
Tate, my mom,

00:10:02.761 --> 00:10:04.628
they can't wait to see you
again!

00:10:04.628 --> 00:10:07.995
That's why I swear I won't
give up 'til I find you.

00:10:07.995 --> 00:10:11.695
And I'm gonna use my dueltaining
skills to stop all the fighting

00:10:11.695 --> 00:10:14.061
and make people smile
in every dimension!

00:10:14.061 --> 00:10:16.061
Listen up, Yuya.

00:10:16.061 --> 00:10:17.895
You call yourself
a duelatiner.

00:10:17.895 --> 00:10:19.295
Well, here's my review.

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:21.995
Your performance was abysmal.
Mediocre at best.

00:10:21.995 --> 00:10:25.695
And I'm gonna bring
the curtain down on you!

00:10:29.728 --> 00:10:33.728
Was Jack right? Was my
performance abysmal?

00:10:33.728 --> 00:10:37.595
Maybe I'm not actually
the dueltainer I thought I was.

00:10:37.595 --> 00:10:41.095
Maybe my skills won't
make a difference.

00:10:44.961 --> 00:10:47.328
My bracelet is glowing again.

00:10:47.328 --> 00:10:50.961
And the only time that happens
is when Yuya is around.

00:10:53.728 --> 00:10:55.661
I hope.

00:10:57.695 --> 00:11:00.895
Jack took everything
I threw at him.

00:11:00.895 --> 00:11:04.728
Mauling Mandible Charge!

00:11:10.495 --> 00:11:13.195
Go, Rune‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:11:13.195 --> 00:11:15.795
Attack Jack Atlas directly!

00:11:17.095 --> 00:11:18.961
(roaring)

00:11:21.195 --> 00:11:23.061
Surprised?
Well, I'm not!

00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:26.495
Because I got the hang of Action
Duels quicker than you expected!

00:11:26.495 --> 00:11:28.995
With the Action Spell Evasive
Evasion,

00:11:28.995 --> 00:11:30.761
I not only got to summon
a Token,

00:11:30.761 --> 00:11:32.728
but I also got to stop
your attack!

00:11:32.728 --> 00:11:36.895
Seems you're not the only man
of action around here, Yuya!

00:11:36.895 --> 00:11:41.361
Nice, but since I used Trump
Girl to Fusion Summon Rune‐Eyes,

00:11:41.361 --> 00:11:43.261
Rune‐Eyes gets
to attack twice!

00:11:43.261 --> 00:11:45.628
Rune‐Eyes, attack his Token!

00:11:45.628 --> 00:11:48.728
I activate the trap
Reject Reborn!

00:11:48.728 --> 00:11:52.795
It slams the brakes on
your monster's attack!

00:11:55.361 --> 00:11:57.861
(thinking)
Jack could have played that
card way earlier

00:11:57.861 --> 00:12:00.061
on Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon
to stop me

00:12:00.061 --> 00:12:03.195
from attacking for the entire
turn, but he didn't.

00:12:03.195 --> 00:12:05.628
He decided to take damage
instead

00:12:05.628 --> 00:12:07.895
and pretend like he was
in trouble.

00:12:12.795 --> 00:12:14.761
(roaring)

00:12:14.761 --> 00:12:17.461
But it was all for show.

00:12:17.461 --> 00:12:19.961
(roaring)

00:12:24.261 --> 00:12:27.095
Reject Reborn
also destroys my Token,

00:12:27.095 --> 00:12:30.261
but I get to bring back two
monsters from my graveyard!

00:12:30.261 --> 00:12:32.361
And that's too bad for you!

00:12:32.361 --> 00:12:33.828
That's not good.

00:12:33.828 --> 00:12:35.895
Not for you it's not!

00:12:35.895 --> 00:12:38.428
I blocked two attacks,
so rise again,

00:12:38.428 --> 00:12:41.395
Red Wyvern and Red Resonator!

00:12:41.395 --> 00:12:42.661
(Yuya)
Then it was time for him

00:12:42.661 --> 00:12:45.628
to put on a real show to get
the crowd fired up.

00:12:45.628 --> 00:12:48.195
(Jack)
Now from the ancient chasms
of a lost world,

00:12:48.195 --> 00:12:51.561
I awake a great and terrible
power.

00:12:53.661 --> 00:12:56.461
I Synchro Summon!

00:12:56.461 --> 00:13:00.795
Now rise, Scarlight Red Dragon
Archfiend!

00:13:02.228 --> 00:13:04.795
And with its arrival will come
your end,

00:13:04.795 --> 00:13:07.628
because thanks to Scarlight Red
Dragon Archfiend,

00:13:07.628 --> 00:13:09.761
I can destroy
all your monsters,

00:13:09.761 --> 00:13:12.228
and then you take 500 points
of damage

00:13:12.228 --> 00:13:14.728
for each one that perished by
its flames!

00:13:14.728 --> 00:13:18.728
Feel the heat, Yuya,
of your impending demise!

00:13:23.328 --> 00:13:25.928
And now, Scarlight
Red Dragon Archfiend,

00:13:25.928 --> 00:13:28.695
attack Yuya directly
then end this!

00:13:28.695 --> 00:13:32.161
Molten Crimson Flare!

00:13:32.161 --> 00:13:34.895
Aah!

00:13:34.895 --> 00:13:36.761
(groans)

00:13:36.761 --> 00:13:39.761
(thinking) Jack had Reject
Reborn since his first turn,

00:13:39.761 --> 00:13:42.528
so he could use it
any time he wanted.

00:13:42.528 --> 00:13:44.928
He was playing with me
the whole time,

00:13:44.928 --> 00:13:46.528
and the crowd ate it up.

00:13:46.528 --> 00:13:48.461
I thought I was the one
who was supposed

00:13:48.461 --> 00:13:52.461
to be entertaining the crowd,
but it was him all along.

00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:54.995
And I call myself a dueltainer?

00:13:54.995 --> 00:13:57.495
I couldn't be more wrong.

00:13:57.495 --> 00:14:00.395
Everything my dad taught me
about dueling,

00:14:00.395 --> 00:14:04.161
making people smile,
making sure to have fun,

00:14:04.161 --> 00:14:05.761
I forgot it all
because winning

00:14:05.761 --> 00:14:08.495
was more important than
losing to Jack.

00:14:08.495 --> 00:14:10.828
How will I ever use my
dueltaining skills

00:14:10.828 --> 00:14:14.295
to make people smile if I can't
even keep myself smiling

00:14:14.295 --> 00:14:17.928
when I come face to face with a
duelist like Jack?

00:14:17.928 --> 00:14:19.095
Huh?

00:14:19.095 --> 00:14:21.128
What's that?

00:14:21.128 --> 00:14:22.861
A card?

00:14:22.861 --> 00:14:25.895
Where'd you come from?

00:14:25.895 --> 00:14:28.028
(knocking)

00:14:28.028 --> 00:14:29.595
Who's there?

00:14:29.595 --> 00:14:33.095
Look, I know you're out there,
I can hear your knees knocking.

00:14:34.228 --> 00:14:36.295
Uh...
It's me.

00:14:36.295 --> 00:14:37.661
Me who?

00:14:37.661 --> 00:14:39.761
Your escort from yesterday.

00:14:39.761 --> 00:14:40.895
Remember?

00:14:40.895 --> 00:14:43.228
(Yuya)
What's your name?

00:14:43.228 --> 00:14:45.395
It's Sam.

00:14:45.395 --> 00:14:48.661
Sam, why'd you
give me this card?

00:14:51.228 --> 00:14:53.795
So that when you win
the Friendship Cup,

00:14:53.795 --> 00:14:55.461
and duel Jack again,

00:14:55.461 --> 00:14:59.095
you can tell him that he can
keep his lousy, no‐good card!

00:15:04.461 --> 00:15:06.428
The big day is finally here.

00:15:06.428 --> 00:15:09.261
The Friendship Cup is ready to
get roaring!

00:15:09.261 --> 00:15:12.795
With over 200,000 fans
jam‐packed into this here arena,

00:15:12.795 --> 00:15:16.295
it shows the city can come
together like grits and gravy!

00:15:16.295 --> 00:15:18.395
(cheering, yelling)

00:15:20.961 --> 00:15:24.528
All righty, folks, my
producer's are telling me
it's go‐time.

00:15:24.528 --> 00:15:28.528
So without further ado, let's
jump right into things!

00:15:28.528 --> 00:15:31.795
The city is one and we're here
for fun!

00:15:31.795 --> 00:15:35.095
Because we're all friends!

00:15:35.095 --> 00:15:37.995
(cheering)

00:15:52.161 --> 00:15:55.895
So, why do you want me to give
this card back to Jack?

00:15:55.895 --> 00:15:59.795
'Cause he's the master
of meanies!

00:15:59.795 --> 00:16:02.261
At least he is now.

00:16:02.261 --> 00:16:05.761
(Sam)
Jack used to be the one person
who gave us Commons hope.

00:16:05.761 --> 00:16:08.628
He was born and raised in the
same slums we were.

00:16:08.628 --> 00:16:12.061
Then, when he made it all the
way to the Friendship Cup

00:16:12.061 --> 00:16:14.128
and he started burning up the
competition

00:16:14.128 --> 00:16:17.528
and taking down Topsiders,
he was our hero.

00:16:17.528 --> 00:16:21.261
Then three years ago, he won
the whole tournament.

00:16:21.261 --> 00:16:24.561
He was the first champ to come
from Commons.

00:16:24.561 --> 00:16:28.028
I was so happy to see him on
that throne.

00:16:28.028 --> 00:16:32.428
But, but after that,
Jack changed.

00:16:32.428 --> 00:16:34.695
He changed how?

00:16:34.695 --> 00:16:36.528
(crowd cheering)

00:16:38.828 --> 00:16:40.528
Howdy hey, you all!

00:16:40.528 --> 00:16:43.995
Now, let's start this rodeo!

00:16:43.995 --> 00:16:46.895
Time for this 'lil ol' gal to
intro the 16 duelists

00:16:46.895 --> 00:16:48.961
in this year's Friendship Cup
Tournament.

00:16:48.961 --> 00:16:50.628
<i>So here we go!</i>

00:16:50.628 --> 00:16:52.761
In yesterday's match,
old Jack

00:16:52.761 --> 00:16:54.795
called this tenderfoot
a dueling dud.

00:16:54.795 --> 00:16:57.161
Now, after getting' creamed
into corn grits,

00:16:57.161 --> 00:16:59.561
can the young buck make a
comeback?

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:02.861
<i>Here's Yuya Sakaki!</i>

00:17:02.861 --> 00:17:04.561
(laughing)

00:17:04.561 --> 00:17:06.761
That poor kid
was a major fail.

00:17:06.761 --> 00:17:09.661
It was adorable how
he tried to keep up, though.

00:17:14.395 --> 00:17:16.461
When Jack became champion,

00:17:16.461 --> 00:17:18.595
he stopped hanging out
with us Commons.

00:17:18.595 --> 00:17:20.961
He became an instant
celebrity.

00:17:20.961 --> 00:17:22.961
His face was everywhere.

00:17:22.961 --> 00:17:25.228
The Topsiders threw him
lavish parties

00:17:25.228 --> 00:17:26.961
and showered him with riches.

00:17:26.961 --> 00:17:28.795
It was almost like
he loved it

00:17:28.795 --> 00:17:31.261
and totally forgot
where he came from.

00:17:31.261 --> 00:17:34.428
But I was still
his biggest fan,

00:17:34.428 --> 00:17:36.895
until that one day...

00:17:39.728 --> 00:17:41.928
There he is!
I can't believe it!

00:17:41.928 --> 00:17:43.128
Yo, Jack!

00:17:43.128 --> 00:17:44.528
(man)
Get back!

00:17:46.628 --> 00:17:48.895
Get off the carpet, kid!

00:17:50.561 --> 00:17:53.595
Mr. Atlas, I'm so sorry,
he just...

00:17:53.595 --> 00:17:56.861
Mr. Atlas, I've been your fan
since, like, forever!

00:17:56.861 --> 00:17:58.795
I'm a Common, like you,

00:17:58.795 --> 00:18:00.728
and I just wanted to say
how super psyched I am

00:18:00.728 --> 00:18:03.761
to talk to you in real life
and not pretend.

00:18:03.761 --> 00:18:07.328
I want to be the next
Master of Faster someday.

00:18:07.328 --> 00:18:11.461
Only problem is I've been a
little slow at getting cards.

00:18:11.461 --> 00:18:14.428
But someday soon,
I'll have a deck,

00:18:14.428 --> 00:18:16.428
and I'm gonna be good enough
to be just like you

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:18.761
and be a champ!
Really?

00:18:18.761 --> 00:18:21.028
How about you take this
as a starter?

00:18:21.028 --> 00:18:24.961
It's absolutely perfect
for you.

00:18:24.961 --> 00:18:27.061
(Yuya)
He gave you this card?

00:18:27.061 --> 00:18:28.195
Yeah.

00:18:28.195 --> 00:18:29.728
It has no attack
or defense points.

00:18:29.728 --> 00:18:32.495
It's, like,
the weakest card ever!

00:18:32.495 --> 00:18:35.495
The one he said
was perfect for me!

00:18:35.495 --> 00:18:39.795
A common, nothing card for
a Common, nothing kid!

00:18:41.328 --> 00:18:43.128
I can't stand him now!

00:18:43.128 --> 00:18:46.128
As soon as he got rich, he sold
out and became a Topsider!

00:18:46.128 --> 00:18:49.195
Jack forgot all about us Commons
and where he came from!!

00:18:49.195 --> 00:18:53.161
So he's a traitor,
just like Crow said.

00:18:55.361 --> 00:18:58.761
(Melissa, on P. A.)
Shinji Weber isn't the only
Common in this tourney,

00:18:58.761 --> 00:19:02.395
so is the highflying
freebird, Crow Hogan!

00:19:02.395 --> 00:19:03.928
Will either of
these two become

00:19:03.928 --> 00:19:06.161
another champion from
Commons, like Jack?

00:19:06.161 --> 00:19:08.661
You know,
I'd almost forgotten.

00:19:08.661 --> 00:19:11.528
Jack came from those ghastly
Commons, didn't he?

00:19:11.528 --> 00:19:14.328
That may be, but so long
as Jack keeps winning,

00:19:14.328 --> 00:19:16.561
he's a Topsider in my books!

00:19:16.561 --> 00:19:20.595
Jack Atlas! That lousy traitor
turned his back on us Commons!

00:19:20.595 --> 00:19:22.395
Hey!
Zip it, pal!

00:19:22.395 --> 00:19:24.895
You know Jack's still a Common,
through and through.

00:19:24.895 --> 00:19:27.328
He's a traitor!
No, he's not!

00:19:27.328 --> 00:19:29.495
(crowd arguing, yelling)

00:19:35.061 --> 00:19:37.295
(Sam)
Now that Jack's become
a Topsider,

00:19:37.295 --> 00:19:40.261
he acts like he's better than
everybody else

00:19:40.261 --> 00:19:43.828
Some think that's he still one
of us Commons and cheer him on.

00:19:43.828 --> 00:19:46.028
But not me.

00:19:46.028 --> 00:19:48.228
I want you to beat him, Yuya!

00:19:48.228 --> 00:19:51.361
Beat him for me and all the
Commons he abandoned!

00:19:51.361 --> 00:19:53.195
But why me, Sam?

00:19:53.195 --> 00:19:55.795
Because you know how I feel,
Yuya?

00:19:55.795 --> 00:19:58.695
(Yuya)
Jack said he would beat me,
and he was right.

00:19:58.695 --> 00:20:01.028
My best wasn't good enough.

00:20:01.028 --> 00:20:04.095
(Sam)
Losing to him must've made
you so sad and angry.

00:20:04.095 --> 00:20:08.728
That's how he makes me feel
every single day of my life.

00:20:08.728 --> 00:20:11.195
Yeah.

00:20:11.195 --> 00:20:14.928
(Melissa, on P. A.)
And there you have our
16 competitors

00:20:14.928 --> 00:20:16.995
for this year's
Friendship Cup!

00:20:16.995 --> 00:20:19.495
I'm trying to talk here!

00:20:19.495 --> 00:20:21.061
Don't y'all fight!

00:20:21.061 --> 00:20:23.128
Let's remember the theme
of this tournament:

00:20:23.128 --> 00:20:24.828
The city is one,

00:20:24.828 --> 00:20:27.995
and we've all gotten together
to have some fun!

00:20:27.995 --> 00:20:29.395
(crowd arguing, yelling)

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:31.895
Come on, people,
work with me here!

00:20:31.895 --> 00:20:33.161
Work with me!

00:20:33.161 --> 00:20:35.195
'Cause now, it's
finally time

00:20:35.195 --> 00:20:37.961
for the long‐awaited
Friendship Cup to begin!

00:20:37.961 --> 00:20:40.761
And the first dustup's
gonna be between

00:20:40.761 --> 00:20:44.028
Crow Hogan and
Gong Strong!

00:20:52.761 --> 00:20:54.995
(thinking)
After what happened to Yuya,

00:20:54.995 --> 00:20:58.428
Gong's gonna show 'em
what us Lancers can do!

00:21:01.295 --> 00:21:03.595
(thinking)
I'm dueling for you.

00:21:03.595 --> 00:21:06.095
'Cause when I win, you win!

00:21:06.095 --> 00:21:07.895
Jack's watching,
right?

00:21:07.895 --> 00:21:09.128
Yes.

00:21:09.128 --> 00:21:11.095
(thinking)
I'm gonna teach that traitor

00:21:11.095 --> 00:21:12.428
that ditching us Commons

00:21:12.428 --> 00:21:14.561
was the biggest mistake
of his life!

00:21:14.561 --> 00:21:17.395
(thinking)
The tournament's finally
starting.

00:21:17.395 --> 00:21:18.928
I believe in you, Yuya.

00:21:18.928 --> 00:21:21.961
I know you can beat Jack if you
get a second chance,

00:21:21.961 --> 00:21:24.861
but I know getting that chance
isn't going to be easy.

00:21:24.861 --> 00:21:28.728
(thinking)
Sam wants me to give this card
back to Jack when I duel him.

00:21:28.728 --> 00:21:30.361
But can I even get to Jack?

00:21:30.361 --> 00:21:32.161
I have to win
the Friendship Cup first,

00:21:32.161 --> 00:21:34.428
and that's a long road to
travel.

00:21:34.428 --> 00:21:36.995
Because I haven't proven
that I can win,

00:21:36.995 --> 00:21:39.461
but I have proven that
I can lose.
