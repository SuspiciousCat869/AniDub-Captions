Last time on
"Yu‐gi‐oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.900
Ladies and gentlemen,
I have an important announcement

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.266
to make on behalf of
the Leo Corporation.

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:12.033
Effective immediately,

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.433
the Arc League
Championship will be...

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:17.366
suspended indefinitely!

00:00:17.366 --> 00:00:20.100
(all gasping)

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:24.900
(gasping)

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.433
Mom, what's with the getup
and the motorcycle?

00:00:28.433 --> 00:00:29.866
Don't call me Mom!

00:00:29.866 --> 00:00:31.900
Call me
the Queen of the Sirens!

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.500
What is they?

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.133
Years back, before Yoko
was Yuya's mom,

00:00:36.133 --> 00:00:37.800
she was part of
a team of lady bikers

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.166
that caused a pretty big stir
in Paradise City.

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.966
If it's a duel
you're looking for,

00:00:41.966 --> 00:00:43.600
it's a duel you'll get!

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.566
When I win, you better not
dock my allowance!

00:00:46.566 --> 00:00:48.666
I'm not gonna
shortchange you.

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:50.800
Not like you're trying
to do to Sora.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.000
What does Sora have
to do with any of this?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.200
Everything! And Loco Yoko's
more than happy to show you why!

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.833
Bring it!

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.400
(both)

(Yoko)
When your father swooped in
to save my Siren sister,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.666
it was like something
out of a movie...

00:02:08.666 --> 00:02:11.433
nobody knew how to make
an entrance like your dad.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:14.366
The only thing more amazing
was his smile.

00:02:15.466 --> 00:02:17.733
The moment our eyes met,

00:02:17.733 --> 00:02:20.600
I knew I would spend
the rest of my life with him.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.800
Oh, be still
my beating heart.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.833
I hope my darling Yuya
would do that for me.

00:02:25.833 --> 00:02:29.300
Yusho was the most extraordinary
duelist I've ever met.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.033
You see, I was battling
to settle scores with punks,

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.233
but your dad,
he had different ideas

00:02:35.233 --> 00:02:37.500
about what dueling
was really about.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.333
I'm baffled why anyone would
want to duel out of hate.

00:02:40.333 --> 00:02:43.166
Remember, it takes more muscles
to frown than to smile,

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.466
and who needs
an unnecessary workout?

00:02:45.466 --> 00:02:47.433
Now, let's see
those pearly whites!

00:02:47.433 --> 00:02:49.300
(chuckling)

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:51.066
Oh...

00:02:51.066 --> 00:02:53.800
Whoa, there's a man
with sparkle!

00:02:57.633 --> 00:03:00.233
Your father showed me
the error of my ways,

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:03.000
and eventually my rule
as Queen of the Sirens

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.633
came to an end.

00:03:04.633 --> 00:03:06.333
I may have hung up
my helmet,

00:03:06.333 --> 00:03:09.600
but your dad's showbiz was about
to launch into the stratosphere.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.733
The Leo Corporation
had just invented

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:14.500
the Augmented Reality Combat
system and, as you know,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.266
dueling was changed forever.

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:19.733
ARC technology led to
the rise of Action Duels.

00:03:19.733 --> 00:03:21.600
When they first began,

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.766
Action Duels were exciting,
but primitive.

00:03:23.766 --> 00:03:25.500
They were focused on
pure power.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.166
They were more about
the monster than the duelist.

00:03:28.166 --> 00:03:30.266
But when your father
came onto the scene,

00:03:30.266 --> 00:03:32.566
he revolutionized everything.

00:03:32.566 --> 00:03:34.466
Yeah.

00:03:34.466 --> 00:03:36.566
(Skip Boyle)
When Yusho started
filling his Action Duels

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:38.933
with acrobatics
and razzle dazzle,

00:03:38.933 --> 00:03:40.600
the door to
the world of Dueltainment

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.700
was flung wide open.

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:45.600
But new doors don't
just open themselves.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.100
Someone's gotta step up
and do something crazy

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.300
and new and push 'em open.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:52.400
Just like you did.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.033
You opened the door
to Pendulum Summoning.

00:03:55.033 --> 00:03:58.133
Principle Boyle helped me see
my dad in a whole new light.

00:03:58.133 --> 00:04:00.333
Dad's style,
his razzle dazzle

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:03.000
made people happy and brought
smiles to their faces

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.633
no matter how dire
or dark things got.

00:04:05.633 --> 00:04:09.100
And? Are you following
in your dad's footsteps?

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:11.266
Are you always trying
to make people happy

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:13.300
no matter how dire
the situation?

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.566
I'm not sure...

00:04:15.566 --> 00:04:18.033
I... guess not.

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.633
But that's easy
for you and dad to say.

00:04:20.633 --> 00:04:23.700
What you were dealing with
is nothing compared to me.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.966
I'm trying to save
an entire planet.

00:04:26.966 --> 00:04:28.633
I see no difference.

00:04:28.633 --> 00:04:30.166
Whatever, mom.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:33.600
Your friend got taken by a bunch
of thugs to the local arcade,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:36.466
not to an entire
new dimension like Zuzu did.

00:04:36.466 --> 00:04:39.200
I tried your way,
but the make‐'em‐smile approach

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.133
only got me a missing Zuzu.

00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:43.533
I'll do whatever it takes
to bring her home.

00:04:43.533 --> 00:04:45.766
I would hate to be
Obelisk Force

00:04:45.766 --> 00:04:47.766
knowing what
I'm gonna do to them!

00:04:47.766 --> 00:04:51.166
But what's the point of saving
Zuzu if you lose yourself?

00:04:51.166 --> 00:04:53.666
What are you
talking about?

00:04:53.666 --> 00:04:56.000
Look, I know
it's heartbreaking.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.933
And heartbreaking
for Skip.

00:04:57.933 --> 00:05:00.433
Zuzu means the world to him
and always has.

00:05:00.433 --> 00:05:03.966
Since Zuzu came into this world,
she's been his everything.

00:05:03.966 --> 00:05:06.333
Even You Show School
took a back seat.

00:05:06.333 --> 00:05:09.566
Skip loved Zuzu so much that
he'd rather change her diapers

00:05:09.566 --> 00:05:11.133
than get his doctorate.

00:05:11.133 --> 00:05:13.933
Our families have been close
from the start, so I know.

00:05:13.933 --> 00:05:17.833
Zuzu has kept Skip smiling
and kept him in line, too.

00:05:17.833 --> 00:05:19.433
I know Skip won't feel
a moment's peace

00:05:19.433 --> 00:05:21.566
till his daughter's
safe and sound.

00:05:21.566 --> 00:05:23.000
It's true!

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.633
Neither will we!

00:05:24.633 --> 00:05:26.966
We miss her!

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:29.666
(groaning)

00:05:29.666 --> 00:05:31.866
You must save Zuzu,
no doubt.

00:05:31.866 --> 00:05:33.766
However,
in your darkest moment,

00:05:33.766 --> 00:05:35.666
you must still do
what your father did.

00:05:35.666 --> 00:05:37.966
And what did
your dad do?

00:05:37.966 --> 00:05:39.466
Tell me...

00:05:39.466 --> 00:05:41.833
He found a way
to save your friend,

00:05:41.833 --> 00:05:44.366
but also save the hearts
of the opponents.

00:05:44.366 --> 00:05:47.633
That's right, so you must
save Zuzu and Sora.

00:05:47.633 --> 00:05:49.500
(gasps)
You must try to help him.

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:51.266
And don't stop with him.

00:05:51.266 --> 00:05:53.166
Yuya, you can
make a difference.

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:56.366
Show everyone what
dueling's really about.

00:05:56.366 --> 00:05:59.466
And just like your dad,
do it with a smile.

00:06:01.633 --> 00:06:04.000
Well, this speech has
certainly gone on long enough,

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.733
and so has this turn.

00:06:05.733 --> 00:06:08.933
So how 'bout you and Loco Yoko
get back to battling?

00:06:08.933 --> 00:06:11.133
Since I ended my turn,

00:06:11.133 --> 00:06:12.866
Smile World's effect
also ends,

00:06:12.866 --> 00:06:15.533
so my monster's attack points
return to normal.

00:06:15.533 --> 00:06:18.766
Road Raven Red Queens'
effect ends as well,

00:06:18.766 --> 00:06:22.300
so you regain control of
Helpprincess and Salutiger,

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:25.333
but they've already served their
purpose, so it's no biggie.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.166
Yoko Loco's
in the driver's seat now,

00:06:31.166 --> 00:06:34.133
think you can overtake
the Queen of the Sirens?

00:06:34.133 --> 00:06:37.100
Get set...
to be dethroned.

00:06:49.776 --> 00:06:52.076
Get set...
to be dethroned.

00:06:57.509 --> 00:07:00.676
Are you ready?
Ah!

00:07:07.343 --> 00:07:10.809
Okay, folks,
let's get on with the show!

00:07:10.809 --> 00:07:12.709
(cheering)

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:15.176
Here's where the fun starts!
And thrills, too!

00:07:15.176 --> 00:07:16.876
I'm so loosey‐goosey!

00:07:16.876 --> 00:07:19.476
Whoa, better pace
yourselves, guys.

00:07:19.476 --> 00:07:20.909
Ready?

00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.676
(all)
Here we go!

00:07:25.276 --> 00:07:27.509
Oh, what a man!

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:29.043
Get set for a performance

00:07:29.043 --> 00:07:30.743
that'll leave you
begging for more.

00:07:30.743 --> 00:07:33.509
Following in the legendary
footsteps of my dad,

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:34.976
I'm gonna
knock your socks off

00:07:34.976 --> 00:07:37.709
with a dueltaining
extravaganza!

00:07:37.709 --> 00:07:39.443
Yes!
Go for it!

00:07:39.443 --> 00:07:41.243
To kick things off,

00:07:41.243 --> 00:07:44.343
I'll use a little something
that's sure to razzle
and dazzle.

00:07:44.343 --> 00:07:46.643
And here we go!

00:07:46.643 --> 00:07:49.709
I'll use Stargazer Magician
and Timegazer Magician

00:07:49.709 --> 00:07:51.609
to set the Pendulum Scale.

00:07:51.609 --> 00:07:54.376
I'm taking control
of this duel starting now!

00:08:00.809 --> 00:08:02.809
I'm allowed to
summon monsters

00:08:02.809 --> 00:08:05.743
from Level 2 through 7
all at the same time!

00:08:05.743 --> 00:08:07.543
Swing far, Pendulum.

00:08:07.543 --> 00:08:09.976
Carve the Arc of Victory!

00:08:11.676 --> 00:08:14.843
My monsters are ready
to swing into action!

00:08:16.109 --> 00:08:18.843
Turn up the heat,
Odd‐Eyes Pendulum Dragon!

00:08:18.843 --> 00:08:20.376
(roaring)

00:08:22.143 --> 00:08:24.443
What comes next?
Show us, show us!

00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:27.809
Please Yuya! Please!
We want to know!

00:08:27.809 --> 00:08:29.276
Then I'll show you.

00:08:29.276 --> 00:08:31.143
In honor of my parents,

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:33.309
I'm going to
try something new.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:36.276
If it works, I'll change this
night and make it bright.

00:08:36.276 --> 00:08:40.243
Now then, check what happens
when I play Magical Sky Mirror.

00:08:43.076 --> 00:08:45.276
Now I can activate a spell
in your graveyard

00:08:45.276 --> 00:08:48.843
that's sure to turn
some frowns upside down.

00:08:48.843 --> 00:08:50.609
I'm activating

00:08:50.609 --> 00:08:52.709
the spell Smile World!

00:08:57.309 --> 00:08:58.776
(all)
Whoa!

00:08:58.776 --> 00:09:00.309
Oh, yeah!

00:09:00.309 --> 00:09:03.043
Goose pickles!

00:09:03.043 --> 00:09:05.009
I love it!

00:09:05.009 --> 00:09:07.609
(Yuya)
For every monster
on the field,

00:09:07.609 --> 00:09:10.209
all our monsters
gain 100 attack points

00:09:10.209 --> 00:09:11.609
until the end of the turn.

00:09:11.609 --> 00:09:13.309
And since there are
four monsters,

00:09:13.309 --> 00:09:15.776
they each get 400
additional attack points.

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:25.243
Look at how
they're all beaming.

00:09:25.243 --> 00:09:27.709
Even her Road Raven
cracked a smile.

00:09:27.709 --> 00:09:31.176
It makes me want to do
the strudel doodle.

00:09:31.176 --> 00:09:33.409
The best is still to come.

00:09:33.409 --> 00:09:36.876
Hang on to your suspenders,
Frederick.

00:09:36.876 --> 00:09:39.176
Hey, Mom,
you better not let

00:09:39.176 --> 00:09:41.609
Odd‐Eye Pendulum Dragon's
smile fool you

00:09:41.609 --> 00:09:43.809
because it's still
full of fury.

00:09:43.809 --> 00:09:46.109
Spiral Flame Strike!

00:09:50.009 --> 00:09:52.043
(grunts)

00:09:52.043 --> 00:09:54.043
And there's more
where that came from, Mom.

00:09:54.043 --> 00:09:56.609
Since your Red Queen
is greater than Level 5,

00:09:56.609 --> 00:09:58.976
Odd‐Eyes deals
double the damage.

00:09:58.976 --> 00:10:00.676
Reaction Force!

00:10:03.876 --> 00:10:06.176
And now my Tiger's
gonna earn its stripes

00:10:06.176 --> 00:10:08.043
by attacking you directly.

00:10:15.109 --> 00:10:17.509
Sorry, Mom.
The name's Loco Yoko!

00:10:17.509 --> 00:10:20.443
And don't you dare forget it,
not for a second.

00:10:20.443 --> 00:10:22.609
I can take whatever
you send my way,

00:10:22.609 --> 00:10:25.476
so save your sorrys
for someone who needs 'em!

00:10:25.476 --> 00:10:27.209
Bring it on, Yuya.

00:10:27.209 --> 00:10:28.909
Okay.

00:10:28.909 --> 00:10:31.243
If that's what you want,
that's what you'll get.

00:10:31.243 --> 00:10:34.809
Helpprincess,
give Loco Yoko a royal sendoff

00:10:34.809 --> 00:10:36.609
with a High Five Strike!

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:54.472
(Yuya)
Give Loco Yoko a royal sendoff
with a High Five Strike.

00:11:13.505 --> 00:11:15.772
(laughing)

00:11:15.772 --> 00:11:18.305
It's been so long
since my last duel,

00:11:18.305 --> 00:11:19.972
I almost forgot
what a blast it is.

00:11:19.972 --> 00:11:22.172
(Skip Boyle)
You may be down
for the 10 count,

00:11:22.172 --> 00:11:24.805
but that duel was a TKO.

00:11:24.805 --> 00:11:27.772
(Frederick)
You are the coolest
"mutter" around.

00:11:31.709 --> 00:11:34.443
Huh?
Yuya, I want you to have this.

00:11:37.043 --> 00:11:39.443
You're giving me
Smile World?

00:11:39.443 --> 00:11:41.676
But this...
is the last card

00:11:41.676 --> 00:11:43.876
dad gave you before
he disappeared.

00:11:43.876 --> 00:11:46.843
And now I'm passing it
on to you.

00:11:46.843 --> 00:11:49.543
Your dad thought that one day
you might need a little help

00:11:49.543 --> 00:11:51.409
to get your smile back.

00:11:51.409 --> 00:11:53.376
It looks like that day
has finally come.

00:11:53.376 --> 00:11:55.409
(gasps)

00:11:55.409 --> 00:11:59.076
Yuya, that card should always
serve as a reminder to you.

00:12:00.409 --> 00:12:01.909
If you're down
in the dumps

00:12:01.909 --> 00:12:03.576
or feel like
the world's against you,

00:12:03.576 --> 00:12:06.009
sometimes making someone smile
can turn things around.

00:12:06.009 --> 00:12:07.543
You're right.

00:12:07.543 --> 00:12:09.509
I know you'll not only
bring back Zuzu,

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:13.276
but also find a way to get
your friend Sora smiling again.

00:12:13.276 --> 00:12:14.709
You can do it, Yuya.

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:16.143
You can stop all the fighting.

00:12:16.143 --> 00:12:18.543
That goes ditto for me.

00:12:18.543 --> 00:12:19.776
And me.

00:12:19.776 --> 00:12:22.409
Me, too.
It's unanimous.

00:12:22.409 --> 00:12:24.609
I won't let you down,
promise.

00:12:24.609 --> 00:12:26.543
(Aura)
I hope you can keep it.

00:12:26.543 --> 00:12:29.943
I tried looking into the future,
but it's fuzzy.

00:12:29.943 --> 00:12:31.876
One thing is clear, though,

00:12:31.876 --> 00:12:34.009
as long as you
stay true to yourself,

00:12:34.009 --> 00:12:36.409
no one has the power
to stop you.

00:12:36.409 --> 00:12:39.243
Oh, and I also saw wedding bells
and a giant diamond ring.

00:12:39.243 --> 00:12:41.643
Good to know.

00:12:50.543 --> 00:12:52.376
Guess this is it.

00:12:52.376 --> 00:12:55.943
I never would've made it
this far without my friends.

00:12:55.943 --> 00:12:57.609
And even though you guys

00:12:57.609 --> 00:12:59.543
won't be coming with
me on this mission,

00:12:59.543 --> 00:13:01.576
I know we're all
in it together.

00:13:01.576 --> 00:13:04.343
With your support,
I can't fail.

00:13:04.343 --> 00:13:06.843
I'll be back soon with Zuzu.

00:13:19.843 --> 00:13:22.076
Have you been
wrestling rhinos again?

00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:24.476
Gong's daddy wanted
to test Gong's toughness.

00:13:24.476 --> 00:13:27.276
No sweat, though, just
another Tuesday at the dojo.

00:13:27.276 --> 00:13:28.243
Hmm.

00:13:30.709 --> 00:13:33.709
Oh, goodie, the two weakest
members of our group

00:13:33.709 --> 00:13:37.309
have finally decided to
grace us with their presence.

00:13:37.309 --> 00:13:39.176
But Yuya beat you before,

00:13:39.176 --> 00:13:40.809
so wouldn't that make you
one of the weakest?

00:13:40.809 --> 00:13:42.709
(scoffs)
Get a haircut.

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:44.976
(Declan)
Good, you're all here.

00:13:49.076 --> 00:13:51.043
Like you actually needed

00:13:51.043 --> 00:13:53.409
anyone else
for the job but me.

00:13:57.743 --> 00:14:00.276
The Seven Super Duelists
have reported in

00:14:00.276 --> 00:14:02.143
and are ready for
your orders, sir.

00:14:02.143 --> 00:14:05.309
We are more than seven.
Oh, right. Sorry, sir.

00:14:05.309 --> 00:14:07.276
Including you,
we are eight!

00:14:07.276 --> 00:14:09.676
We're nine.

00:14:09.676 --> 00:14:11.376
Riley will be joining us.

00:14:15.143 --> 00:14:17.909
We're not going
on a field trip.

00:14:17.909 --> 00:14:21.043
How're we supposed
take on Duel Academy

00:14:21.043 --> 00:14:23.743
in the Fusion Dimension
if we have to babysit?

00:14:23.743 --> 00:14:25.543
The kid'll get in our way.

00:14:25.543 --> 00:14:28.543
(Declan)
As a duelist, Riley could
stand up to any one of you.

00:14:28.543 --> 00:14:30.043
How could Riley
stand up to me

00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:32.143
when the pip squeak
barely reaches my kneecaps?

00:14:32.143 --> 00:14:35.843
Hi there. Bet you're awesome if
Declan wants you on our squad.

00:14:35.843 --> 00:14:39.343
How old are you?
Take a wild guess, genius.

00:14:39.343 --> 00:14:42.343
I bet that small fry hasn't made
it out of nursery school yet.

00:14:42.343 --> 00:14:44.943
And anyway, what's Riley done
to earn the honor

00:14:44.943 --> 00:14:47.909
of battling beside me, the
world's top Pendulum duelist?

00:14:47.909 --> 00:14:49.709
(Gong)
Give Gong a break, Sylvio.

00:14:49.709 --> 00:14:51.843
Yuya's the Pendulum
master here.

00:14:51.843 --> 00:14:55.176
The only thing you're tops at
is tootin' your own horn.

00:14:55.176 --> 00:14:56.876
I don't like it one bit.

00:14:56.876 --> 00:14:58.909
Attacking the Fusion Dimension
is tough enough

00:14:58.909 --> 00:15:01.843
without having to
keep our eyes on that kid.

00:15:01.843 --> 00:15:05.176
Then it's a good thing
we won't be going there.

00:15:05.176 --> 00:15:07.776
We're not?
(all gasp)

00:15:21.215 --> 00:15:22.981
(Declan)
Our first destination

00:15:22.981 --> 00:15:24.781
will be the Synchro Dimension.

00:15:24.781 --> 00:15:28.281
Why would we go there
instead of Fusion?

00:15:28.281 --> 00:15:31.415
Because Obelisk Force
hasn't invaded there yet.

00:15:31.415 --> 00:15:33.248
If we get there first,

00:15:33.248 --> 00:15:35.715
we can recruit duelists
and form an alliance

00:15:35.715 --> 00:15:38.181
between the Synchro
Dimension and ours.

00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:41.648
By standing together,
we can crush Duel Academy.

00:15:41.648 --> 00:15:44.548
We don't have time to stumble
around looking for friends.

00:15:44.548 --> 00:15:47.615
Our best chance against
Duel Academy is to strike now.

00:15:47.615 --> 00:15:49.315
We can catch them
by surprise

00:15:49.315 --> 00:15:51.581
and end this fight
once and for all.

00:15:51.581 --> 00:15:55.048
(Declan)
Your plan is perfect if you
want us to meet with disaster.

00:15:55.048 --> 00:15:57.548
What?
I'm afraid Obelisk Force

00:15:57.548 --> 00:15:59.781
is more formidable
than you realize.

00:15:59.781 --> 00:16:02.115
Defeating them will require
a larger fighting force

00:16:02.115 --> 00:16:05.748
than we currently have,
plus careful preparations.

00:16:05.748 --> 00:16:08.615
I should have known it was
a mistake to team up with you.

00:16:08.615 --> 00:16:10.748
If you're too timid to
bring the fight to them,

00:16:10.748 --> 00:16:12.915
I'll go it alone.

00:16:12.915 --> 00:16:15.381
You'll never win.

00:16:15.381 --> 00:16:17.615
I've seen you take down
Obelisk Force

00:16:17.615 --> 00:16:18.981
and I know
how good you are,

00:16:18.981 --> 00:16:20.748
but don't forget
they outnumber you.

00:16:20.748 --> 00:16:23.281
The Professor gathered warriors
from all over Fusion

00:16:23.281 --> 00:16:25.348
and trained them
to be ruthless in battle.

00:16:25.348 --> 00:16:28.348
You can't beat them alone,
no matter how skilled you are.

00:16:28.348 --> 00:16:30.115
Declan's plan makes sense.

00:16:30.115 --> 00:16:32.481
Our mission won't be easy,
but by building up our forces

00:16:32.481 --> 00:16:34.215
and planning
our assault carefully,

00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:36.148
this is a fight
we can win.

00:16:36.148 --> 00:16:39.581
Don't worry, your sister's
going to be okay, trust me.

00:16:41.115 --> 00:16:44.315
The Professor didn't hurt me
and he won't hurt Lulu.

00:16:44.315 --> 00:16:47.015
After all,
we're practically twins.

00:16:47.015 --> 00:16:49.415
Triplets if you count Zuzu.
Huh?

00:16:49.415 --> 00:16:52.148
For some reason,
the Professor must be trying

00:16:52.148 --> 00:16:54.015
to bring all of us together.

00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:57.048
That has to be why he had
Lulu taken to Duel Academy

00:16:57.048 --> 00:17:00.715
and it also explains why he sent
Obelisk Force to hunt me down.

00:17:00.715 --> 00:17:02.948
And hunt down Zuzu.

00:17:02.948 --> 00:17:04.748
(groans)

00:17:04.748 --> 00:17:06.548
I don't have a clue
what the Professor

00:17:06.548 --> 00:17:09.781
is planning to do with us,
but it must be important to him.

00:17:09.781 --> 00:17:13.715
He's putting a lot of time
and resources into finding us.

00:17:13.715 --> 00:17:16.481
So the last thing he'd want
is to put us in harm's way.

00:17:16.481 --> 00:17:20.081
Lulu may be scared,
but she's definitely safe.

00:17:20.081 --> 00:17:22.681
And Zuzu, do you think
she's safe, too?

00:17:22.681 --> 00:17:24.981
Zuzu isn't at
Duel Academy.

00:17:24.981 --> 00:17:26.315
Huh?

00:17:26.315 --> 00:17:28.281
Is she, Declan?

00:17:28.281 --> 00:17:29.381
Huh?
Huh?

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.148
Tell them what you told me.

00:17:31.148 --> 00:17:34.181
Zuzu transported away
with a Synchro duelist.

00:17:34.181 --> 00:17:35.981
Ah!

00:17:35.981 --> 00:17:37.615
(thinking)
Well, I'll be fused.

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:39.648
I thought the Professor
had her for sure.

00:17:39.648 --> 00:17:41.581
Is that really true?

00:17:41.581 --> 00:17:44.148
Did you see Zuzu
go to the Synchro Dimension?

00:17:44.148 --> 00:17:45.781
I did, Yuya.

00:17:45.781 --> 00:17:47.381
A duelist from Synchro

00:17:47.381 --> 00:17:50.481
grabbed Zuzu
and they vanished.

00:17:50.481 --> 00:17:53.015
Earlier in the battle royal,
that same duelist

00:17:53.015 --> 00:17:55.881
defeated three members
of Obelisk Force.

00:17:55.881 --> 00:17:58.281
When I witnessed
that confrontation,

00:17:58.281 --> 00:18:01.248
I knew at once we should
ally with Synchro.

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:04.748
We'll find Zuzu in Synchro,
I'm sure of it.

00:18:04.748 --> 00:18:08.515
We have to get there fast,
before Obelisk Force finds her.

00:18:08.515 --> 00:18:10.481
(grunts)

00:18:10.481 --> 00:18:11.948
Don't be foolish, Shay.

00:18:11.948 --> 00:18:14.815
You know that this is the best
way to save your sister.

00:18:14.815 --> 00:18:17.081
All right, then.

00:18:27.581 --> 00:18:29.781
My technicians
equipped these Duel Disks

00:18:29.781 --> 00:18:32.215
with positron warp drives
that can spring us

00:18:32.215 --> 00:18:33.948
to the other dimensions.

00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:35.848
They reverse engineered
this technology

00:18:35.848 --> 00:18:38.948
using a Duel Disk
from the Xyz Dimension.

00:18:38.948 --> 00:18:41.781
How did you get your hands
on a Xyz Duel Disk?

00:18:41.781 --> 00:18:43.415
Oh, I know...

00:18:43.415 --> 00:18:46.415
Someone got it for you
by swiping it from Yuto.

00:18:46.415 --> 00:18:48.148
And I'm betting that
somebody was you!

00:18:48.148 --> 00:18:49.615
I never believed
that Yuto

00:18:49.615 --> 00:18:52.748
just gave you his
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:18:52.748 --> 00:18:54.148
You stole it from him!

00:18:54.148 --> 00:18:56.248
Along with his Duel Disk.

00:18:56.248 --> 00:18:58.381
(Yuto)
You're wrong!

00:18:58.381 --> 00:19:01.115
You can count on Yuya
as a true friend.

00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:03.481
He will never betray us.

00:19:03.481 --> 00:19:04.681
Trust me, Shay!

00:19:04.681 --> 00:19:06.281
Yuto...

00:19:08.848 --> 00:19:11.115
Something wrong?

00:19:11.115 --> 00:19:13.581
No.

00:19:13.581 --> 00:19:15.915
Back to business.

00:19:15.915 --> 00:19:18.181
Your Duel Disks
have been installed

00:19:18.181 --> 00:19:20.148
with cutting‐edge technology
that enables them

00:19:20.148 --> 00:19:21.781
to activate Action Fields.

00:19:21.781 --> 00:19:23.415
It's important
to become experts

00:19:23.415 --> 00:19:25.681
with the new functions
of your Duel Disks.

00:19:25.681 --> 00:19:28.681
Pendulum Summoning and
Action Cards are two weapons

00:19:28.681 --> 00:19:30.881
that our adversary
does not have.

00:19:30.881 --> 00:19:33.048
These are the keys
to our victory.

00:19:33.048 --> 00:19:36.581
Now, take hold of
your Dimensionizers.

00:19:38.481 --> 00:19:41.148
I've uploaded the coordinates
for Synchro Dimension

00:19:41.148 --> 00:19:42.648
into these cards.

00:19:42.648 --> 00:19:46.348
Insert them into your Duel Disks
and activate them on my command.

00:19:55.815 --> 00:19:58.281
(Frederick)
I hope Yuya sends a postcard

00:19:58.281 --> 00:20:00.415
when he reaches
the next dimension.

00:20:00.415 --> 00:20:03.281
(Allie)
I doubt there's interdimensional
mail delivery, Frederick.

00:20:03.281 --> 00:20:06.181
(Yoko)
But I'm sure he'll be
thinking of us often.

00:20:06.181 --> 00:20:09.048
Just as we'll all
be thinking of Yuya.

00:20:09.048 --> 00:20:11.081
Guten Tag, Nico.

00:20:11.081 --> 00:20:13.715
That boy had
enormous potential.

00:20:13.715 --> 00:20:16.381
I planned to turn him
into a superstar.

00:20:16.381 --> 00:20:19.948
Yuya would've taken
the pro circuit by storm.

00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:22.448
He would have been
adored by the masses.

00:20:22.448 --> 00:20:24.548
I guess it just
wasn't meant to be.

00:20:24.548 --> 00:20:27.348
Cheer up, Nico, because
I know Yuya will come back.

00:20:27.348 --> 00:20:30.381
And he's gonna bring Zuzu
back with him, too.

00:20:30.381 --> 00:20:32.081
After he knocks
the "knockwurst"

00:20:32.081 --> 00:20:34.548
out of those dimensions
with his razamataz.

00:20:34.548 --> 00:20:35.915
You said it, Fred!

00:20:35.915 --> 00:20:37.781
Yuya's gonna show
that dueltaining

00:20:37.781 --> 00:20:41.715
is the best in this world,
their world, or any world!

00:20:41.715 --> 00:20:44.115
Go get 'em, champ!

00:20:44.115 --> 00:20:45.681
Prepare to 'port.

00:20:45.681 --> 00:20:49.181
Activate your cards
in three, two, one...

00:20:49.181 --> 00:20:51.015
go!

00:23:30.648 --> 00:23:33.648
