WEBVTT

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.366
(Yuya)
Previously on
"Yu‐Gi‐Oh! ARC‐V"...

00:00:06.766 --> 00:00:08.966
Go!

00:00:08.966 --> 00:00:11.133
(whimpering)

00:00:11.133 --> 00:00:12.666
You've dueled
enough times

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:15.000
to know when a comeback
is impossible,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.933
so save me the time
and the trouble

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.933
and hand Celina
over to me.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.133
Never!

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.266
Barrett, I can't believe
you couldn't handle

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.100
such a simple
bounty hunt.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.366
I'll handle things
from here.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:29.600
I'll be taking these three fools
into custody.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.666
I finally found you,
you snake!

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.733
I've got a score to settle
with you,

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:38.633
and we're settling it now!

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.566
That's what you get
for taking RinRin!

00:00:41.566 --> 00:00:44.033
What the Professor wants,
the Professor gets.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:48.233
He wanted Rin, just like
he wants me to get Celina now.

00:00:48.233 --> 00:00:49.600
Let's duel!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.800
What's that? Everyone from
the underground has escaped?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.433
Order our reserve units
to comb the city for escapees.

00:00:56.433 --> 00:00:59.233
We must keep our focus
on Obelisk Force.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.233
They won't capture
Celina or Zuzu!

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:05.600
(gasps)
Why is it glowing now?

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.666
(Yuri)
Your Dragon is impressive.

00:01:10.666 --> 00:01:14.233
Annihilating it will give me
tremendous pleasure.

00:01:14.233 --> 00:01:16.366
I Fusion Summon!

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:20.300
Arise, Starving Venom
Fusion Dragon!

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.566
(grunting)

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.933

I think I'm getting closer.

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:47.566
C'mon, Yuya.
I know you're around here.

00:02:53.466 --> 00:02:54.600
(grunts)

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.600
What's wrong with Yuya?

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.433
It's like he's completely
out of control.

00:02:59.433 --> 00:03:01.366
And his monsters
aren't looking so good either.

00:03:03.833 --> 00:03:06.333
(roaring)

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.866
(screaming)

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:14.066
(roaring)

00:03:17.833 --> 00:03:20.300
(grunting)

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.766
(roaring)

00:03:22.766 --> 00:03:25.233
(grunting)

00:03:25.233 --> 00:03:27.033
(grunting)

00:03:34.866 --> 00:03:36.566
Yuya?

00:03:36.566 --> 00:03:41.300
It's finally time.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.533
Finally time... to reunite.

00:03:45.533 --> 00:03:47.233
Reunite...

00:03:47.233 --> 00:03:50.366
and become whole
just as before.

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:52.133
I shall resurrect.

00:03:52.133 --> 00:03:57.100
Resurrect...
and return back here.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.500
Back as one.

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:05.500
He's in there.
I can feel it.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.700
(roaring)

00:04:12.766 --> 00:04:14.866
(roaring)

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:24.933
Things are
getting crazy.

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:27.900
We must stand firm
and hold our ground.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.966
Where's he going?

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:30.633
No idea.

00:04:30.633 --> 00:04:34.333
Reunite... as one.

00:04:34.333 --> 00:04:37.933
Reunite... as one.

00:04:39.533 --> 00:04:42.633
Reunite as one.

00:04:42.633 --> 00:04:44.800
Reunite as one.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.066
What are you
babblin' about?

00:04:49.066 --> 00:04:53.133
You think acting crazy
is gonna throw me off my game?

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:57.000
I'm resurrecting now!

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.833
(roaring)

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:04.800
(roaring)

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.233
I'm resurrecting now!

00:05:09.233 --> 00:05:10.633
Yuya!

00:05:10.633 --> 00:05:11.833
No!

00:05:11.833 --> 00:05:12.933
Yuya!

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.700
(grunting)

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.433
No! Yuri!

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:24.533
(roaring)

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:28.766
(screaming)

00:05:28.766 --> 00:05:31.200
Oh, no!

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.300
Yuya!

00:05:35.866 --> 00:05:39.566
The light... it's gone.

00:05:39.566 --> 00:05:42.400
Yuya, are you okay?

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:44.866
Zuzu, how did
you find me?

00:05:44.866 --> 00:05:47.000
Zuzu Boyle?

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.566
The Professor wants you too,

00:05:49.566 --> 00:05:52.700
but I never expected
you would come to me.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.733
This is bad.
Zuzu, get outta here!

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:58.000
Don't even bother trying.

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.200
Both you and Celina
are mine.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.233
Guess again!

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:04.533
Neither of them
are going anywhere!

00:06:04.533 --> 00:06:07.500
Not as long as I can stand
on my own two feet.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.000
Yuya...

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.700
(grunts)

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.533
(grunting)

00:06:12.533 --> 00:06:16.766
You may be able to stand up,
but you can't stand up to me.

00:06:16.766 --> 00:06:19.266
Take a real good look
at yourself.

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:21.700
You and your monsters
are all chained up.

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.233
You barely have a leg
to stand on.

00:06:24.233 --> 00:06:26.966
You're wrong,
and I'll prove it to you!

00:06:26.966 --> 00:06:29.600
Heh. I admire
your spirit, kid,

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.233
but you can't win a duel
on spirit alone.

00:06:32.233 --> 00:06:33.433
(gasps)

00:06:33.433 --> 00:06:35.500
It also takes tactics,

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.766
tactics I've used
to trap you

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:42.433
and take down foes
far superior to you.

00:06:42.433 --> 00:06:43.400
Yuya‐‐

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.533
Zuzu, don't worry
about me!

00:06:45.533 --> 00:06:47.333
It's fine.

00:06:47.333 --> 00:06:48.900
I'll get us
outta this.

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.966
Duel Academy won't
hurt you or Celina.

00:06:51.966 --> 00:06:55.733
Trust me, it'll
all work out, 'kay?

00:06:59.266 --> 00:07:02.333
(Barrett)
Heh, another promise
that you can't keep.

00:07:02.333 --> 00:07:03.666
Very well, then.

00:07:03.666 --> 00:07:05.900
I'll just have
to finish you.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.433
Let's battle.

00:07:07.433 --> 00:07:11.800
Panther Predator, attack his
Dark Rebellion Xyz Dragon.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:12.733
(growling)

00:07:14.866 --> 00:07:16.533
Due to Crimson Chain's
effect,

00:07:16.533 --> 00:07:21.566
your Dragon isn't destroyed,
but you still take damage.

00:07:21.566 --> 00:07:23.733
And that triggers
Steel Chain's effect,

00:07:23.733 --> 00:07:25.766
so both your Dragons
lose attack points

00:07:25.766 --> 00:07:28.333
equal to the damage
you suffered.

00:07:28.333 --> 00:07:33.466
Odd‐Eyes and Dark Rebellion
lose 700 attack points each.

00:07:36.533 --> 00:07:39.700
But your misery
is far from over, Yuya!

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:44.833
Beastborg Wolf Kampfer deals you
an extra 300 points of damage!

00:07:44.833 --> 00:07:46.400
(grunting)

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:48.566
And watch history
repeat itself

00:07:48.566 --> 00:07:51.866
as my Steel Chain
zaps 300 more attack points

00:07:51.866 --> 00:07:53.333
out of your monsters.

00:07:53.333 --> 00:07:55.500
(roaring)

00:07:55.500 --> 00:07:56.866
(grunts)

00:07:56.866 --> 00:07:59.966
Neither of Yuya's Dragons
has any attack points left!

00:07:59.966 --> 00:08:02.500
You're down
to 600 life points,

00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.700
which isn't enough to survive
my attack next turn.

00:08:05.700 --> 00:08:07.866
It's game over, Yuya.

00:08:07.866 --> 00:08:09.000
(grunts)

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.633
I told you
that you would fail,

00:08:11.633 --> 00:08:14.300
but you refused
to listen.

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.266
The moment you chose
to duel me,

00:08:16.266 --> 00:08:19.800
there was no hope for you
escaping in one piece.

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:22.500
No hope?

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.833
Is he right?

00:08:23.833 --> 00:08:26.333
Do I have no hope
at all, Dad?

00:08:26.333 --> 00:08:27.400
Mom?

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:29.766
It's really...
over?

00:08:33.533 --> 00:08:35.200
After I've come this far?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.800
It can't end like this.

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:39.900
It just can't,
even if it takes a miracle!

00:08:39.900 --> 00:08:41.133
(rumbling)

00:08:41.133 --> 00:08:42.333
Huh?

00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:47.400
I found you.

00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:48.400
It's Sergey!

00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.866
Why's he here?

00:08:49.866 --> 00:08:53.300
(computer voice)
Intrusion penalty,
2,000 life points.

00:08:54.900 --> 00:08:55.900
(beeping)

00:08:57.733 --> 00:08:59.533
What a pleasant surprise.

00:08:59.533 --> 00:09:02.700
Searching for Celina
led me right to Zuzu.

00:09:02.700 --> 00:09:05.533
(light chuckle)
Seize them both, Sergey.

00:09:05.533 --> 00:09:07.200
Affirmative, sir.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:10.166
I activate
Earthbound Prison!

00:09:15.433 --> 00:09:16.533
(whimpering)

00:09:19.066 --> 00:09:20.200
Aah!

00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:22.166
Zuzu, are you okay?

00:09:22.166 --> 00:09:25.400
I am, but...
I'm trapped in here!

00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.533
(Yuya)
Don't sweat it!
I'll break ya outta there soon!

00:09:33.766 --> 00:09:34.766
Good.

00:09:34.766 --> 00:09:35.866
Now, Sergey,

00:09:35.866 --> 00:09:37.700
after you defeat
Barrett and Yuya,

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.833
no one can stop me.

00:09:39.833 --> 00:09:41.200
(laughing)

00:09:45.233 --> 00:09:46.733
(thunder)

00:09:53.233 --> 00:09:55.366
I must defeat
Barrett and Yuya

00:09:55.366 --> 00:09:58.733
to claim Zuzu and Celina
for Master Roget.

00:09:58.733 --> 00:10:00.966
Zuzu has been isolated.

00:10:00.966 --> 00:10:03.166
Refocus target on Barrett.

00:10:03.166 --> 00:10:05.933
Initiating
anti‐Fusion Dimension protocols

00:10:05.933 --> 00:10:09.266
for optimal strategies
to defeat Barrett.

00:10:09.266 --> 00:10:11.433
I don't know
who you are,

00:10:11.433 --> 00:10:13.166
but I don't take
too kindly

00:10:13.166 --> 00:10:15.000
to those who
interrupt my battles.

00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:21.000
Especially those who then have
the nerve to threaten me!

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.300
Go ahead and make your move,
you freak!

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:27.000
Since Earthbound Prison
is in play,

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.133
I am granted opportunity
to summon

00:10:29.133 --> 00:10:32.166
Earthbound Prisoner
Stone Sweeper from hand.

00:10:37.166 --> 00:10:43.333
Next I summon Tuner Monster
Earthbound Prisoner Line Walker.

00:10:43.333 --> 00:10:46.933
Those monsters can't do anything
against me.

00:10:46.933 --> 00:10:48.833
Next step on protocol

00:10:48.833 --> 00:10:53.466
is to activate spell card
Harmonic Synchro Fusion.

00:10:53.466 --> 00:10:58.133
I use two monsters to Synchro
Summon and Fusion Summon!

00:11:01.266 --> 00:11:02.333
No way!

00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:04.733
Synchro Summon
and Fusion Summon?

00:11:04.733 --> 00:11:08.866
Initiating Synchro Summon
as primary action.

00:11:14.766 --> 00:11:17.466
Level 3
Earthbound Prisoner Line Walker

00:11:17.466 --> 00:11:21.500
tunes level 5 Earthbound
Prisoner Stone Sweeper.

00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:23.433
I Synchro Summon!

00:11:23.433 --> 00:11:26.533
Earthbound Servant
Geo Gryphon!

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:30.533
(roaring)

00:11:32.933 --> 00:11:36.600
Initiating Fusion Summon
as secondary action.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:40.666
These two Earthbound Prisoners
assimilate into one!

00:11:45.933 --> 00:11:47.633
I Fusion Summon!

00:11:47.633 --> 00:11:51.466
Earthbound Servant
Geo Kraken!

00:11:51.466 --> 00:11:53.600
(roaring)

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.600
Bravo.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:55.733
By creating a hybrid

00:11:55.733 --> 00:11:57.800
of both Synchro
and Fusion Summoning,

00:11:57.800 --> 00:11:59.166
I've combined
the best aspects

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:03.333
of New Domino City
and Duel Academy.

00:12:03.333 --> 00:12:05.766
Yes, only I could achieve
such a feat.

00:12:05.766 --> 00:12:09.300
Now use this power
to dispel him from my world.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.133
Yes, master.

00:12:11.133 --> 00:12:15.800
(Sergey)
Geo Kraken, attack Wolf Kampfer!

00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:18.333
(roaring)

00:12:18.333 --> 00:12:20.100
(grunts)
Nice try,

00:12:20.100 --> 00:12:23.166
but when Wolf Kampfer's
destroyed in battle,

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:24.400
I can summon the monsters

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:26.766
that were used to create it
from my graveyard!

00:12:28.866 --> 00:12:30.866
(growling)

00:12:30.866 --> 00:12:34.866
Geo Gryphon,
attack Panther Predator!

00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:40.166
When Panther Predator's
destroyed,

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:43.600
I can summon the monsters
used to create it, too!

00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:51.600
But since I no longer
have any Beastborgs

00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.333
standing on my front lines,

00:12:53.333 --> 00:12:56.333
my Steel Chain and Crimson Chain
are both destroyed,

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:59.700
releasing Yuya and his monsters
from lockdown.

00:13:04.166 --> 00:13:05.233
Zuzu!

00:13:05.233 --> 00:13:06.600
You're free!

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.200
That's so great!

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.300
Don't worry,

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.066
I'll break you outta
this weird glowy cage

00:13:11.066 --> 00:13:12.433
in no time flat!

00:13:12.433 --> 00:13:13.833
(grunts)

00:13:13.833 --> 00:13:17.333
Or maybe give me a few more
seconds to figure this one out.

00:13:17.333 --> 00:13:18.933
(Barrett)
There's nothing to figure out.

00:13:18.933 --> 00:13:20.366
Huh?

00:13:20.366 --> 00:13:22.800
As soon as I defeat
this creep,

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:24.133
you're right back
to being

00:13:24.133 --> 00:13:28.000
my number‐one target
for elimination, Yuya.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:30.666
Am I supposed to be
scared by that?

00:13:30.666 --> 00:13:31.933
Duel Yuya?

00:13:31.933 --> 00:13:34.366
How when you
will lose to me?

00:13:34.366 --> 00:13:36.833
Good, Barrett.

00:13:36.833 --> 00:13:39.833
(Barrett)
You only dealt me
a temporary setback.

00:13:39.833 --> 00:13:42.166
I can use the spell
Beastborg Fusioner

00:13:42.166 --> 00:13:43.300
on my next turn

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.500
to resurrect
my Beastborg Squadron

00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:48.633
and force you to retreat
back to your barracks.

00:13:48.633 --> 00:13:51.266
You are not going to have
a second turn.

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:54.566
Analyzing enemy's monsters.

00:13:54.566 --> 00:13:57.166
Calculating endgame scenarios.

00:13:58.666 --> 00:14:02.333
Victory confirmed!

00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:05.000
Due to Geo Kraken's
special ability,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.400
all monsters summoned
during my turn are destroyed.

00:14:11.333 --> 00:14:12.900
What?
All of 'em?

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:22.766
And you take
800 points of damage

00:14:22.766 --> 00:14:24.800
for every
destroyed monster,

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:29.233
which is enough to eliminate
all your life points.

00:14:29.233 --> 00:14:30.566
(screaming)

00:14:35.166 --> 00:14:36.633
(whimpers)

00:14:36.633 --> 00:14:38.000
(groans)

00:14:39.433 --> 00:14:41.400
Barrett?

00:14:41.400 --> 00:14:44.400
Oh, no!
Barrett lost!

00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.300
Celina, I may have lost,

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.000
but I'm still
carrying out my mission.

00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:54.466
You will return
to Duel Academy,

00:14:54.466 --> 00:14:56.933
but I will not be able
to protect you.

00:14:56.933 --> 00:14:59.166
Barrett, no.

00:14:59.166 --> 00:15:00.200
Quit it!

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.300
You can't send Celina
back there!

00:15:04.633 --> 00:15:05.833
Don't do it!

00:15:05.833 --> 00:15:07.833
(Barrett)
Time to go.

00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:15.000
(Yuya)
No!

00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.600
Celina!

00:15:24.133 --> 00:15:26.166
(Yuya)
No!

00:15:26.166 --> 00:15:27.766
Celina!

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:30.866
It's horrible!

00:15:30.866 --> 00:15:32.566
She's gone!

00:15:32.566 --> 00:15:35.266
One down, one to go.

00:15:35.266 --> 00:15:36.700
You brainless baboon!

00:15:36.700 --> 00:15:38.666
How could you let him
take her?

00:15:38.666 --> 00:15:42.800
At least salvage this mess
by capturing Zuzu Boyle.

00:15:44.266 --> 00:15:45.866
Sergey!

00:15:45.866 --> 00:15:48.366
You won't lay a finger
on Zuzu!

00:15:48.366 --> 00:15:50.000
I may have failed Celina,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.133
but that's the last misstep
I'm making today!

00:15:53.133 --> 00:15:55.400
Whatever you do,
whatever you try,

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:57.466
I will stop you!

00:15:57.466 --> 00:15:59.700
Yuya.

00:15:59.700 --> 00:16:01.066
That is incorrect.

00:16:01.066 --> 00:16:04.600
You do not have cards
to win.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:06.933
We'll see about that!
I draw!

00:16:06.933 --> 00:16:08.366
Be careful, Yuya!

00:16:08.366 --> 00:16:11.033
Sergey has plenty
of tricks.

00:16:11.033 --> 00:16:12.166
I'll start things off

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:16.100
by activating the spell card
Magical Thunder.

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:18.900
By sending a spell card
in my hand to the graveyard,

00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:20.233
Magical Thunder strikes

00:16:20.233 --> 00:16:22.933
and destroys one card
on your field!

00:16:22.933 --> 00:16:24.733
How predictable.

00:16:24.733 --> 00:16:28.900
This is precisely the move
I expected Yuya to make.

00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:30.600
Sergey's already set
to counteract it

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.866
with Earthbound
Spell Sealer.

00:16:33.866 --> 00:16:35.200
When you activate a spell,

00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.500
this trap negates and destroys
that spell,

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.400
rendering it
entirely useless.

00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.700
I programmed Sergey to
anticipate all your strategies,

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.600
so you can't win.

00:16:45.600 --> 00:16:47.300
Don't let Sergey get to you.

00:16:47.300 --> 00:16:50.200
I'll be fine.
Worry about yourself!

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.400
Huh?

00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.266
If you duel
like you always have,

00:16:53.266 --> 00:16:55.600
I know you'll come out
on top.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.700
Believe in yourself!

00:16:57.700 --> 00:17:00.133
You can swing things your way
again!

00:17:05.233 --> 00:17:07.500
If I'm going to swing things
my way,

00:17:07.500 --> 00:17:10.000
I have to duel
to make people smile.

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.366
I can't forget who I am.

00:17:12.366 --> 00:17:17.600
(Yoko)
Yuya, that card should always
serve as a reminder to you.

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:19.000
If you're down in the dumps

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.800
or feel like the world's
against you,

00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:24.200
sometimes making someone smile
can turn things around.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:25.466
(Yuya)
Zuzu's right.

00:17:25.466 --> 00:17:27.233
The way I've been dueling
so far,

00:17:27.233 --> 00:17:30.066
I couldn't even make
a hyena laugh.

00:17:30.066 --> 00:17:32.366
But it's time
for all of that to change.

00:17:32.366 --> 00:17:36.333
It's time for me
to swing into action!

00:17:36.333 --> 00:17:38.800
I discard Smile World
from my hand

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:40.866
to destroy
one of your cards!

00:17:40.866 --> 00:17:43.333
Which monster
will you destroy?

00:17:43.333 --> 00:17:47.566
My Geo Gryphon
or my Geo Kraken?

00:17:47.566 --> 00:17:49.066
Neither!
I choose to destroy

00:17:49.066 --> 00:17:52.000
your Field Spell
Earthbound Prison!

00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.000
Huh?

00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:53.966
(groans)

00:17:56.033 --> 00:17:57.400
Unbelievable!

00:17:57.400 --> 00:17:59.166
Why, this unexpected move

00:17:59.166 --> 00:18:01.800
has completely fried
Sergey's programming.

00:18:06.633 --> 00:18:08.100
(grunting)

00:18:10.466 --> 00:18:12.900
(Sergey)
Rebooting complete.

00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:15.066
By destroying
Earthbound Prison,

00:18:15.066 --> 00:18:16.966
you lose half
your life points,

00:18:16.966 --> 00:18:21.500
and your monsters can no longer
use their special abilities.

00:18:27.533 --> 00:18:29.900
I'm free!

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:32.000
Yuya knew he'd take
major damage,

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.266
but he did it anyway
to save Zuzu!

00:18:34.266 --> 00:18:35.666
Yuya!

00:18:35.666 --> 00:18:37.333
(Obelisk Force K)
Halt!
Huh?

00:18:37.333 --> 00:18:39.533
You're coming with us!
(whimpers)

00:18:39.533 --> 00:18:41.033
Zuzu!

00:18:41.033 --> 00:18:42.333
(groaning)

00:18:42.333 --> 00:18:43.866
(whimpers)

00:18:43.866 --> 00:18:46.266
Stay back.

00:18:46.266 --> 00:18:47.400
Moon Shadow.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:49.833
This mission just got
way more risky.

00:18:49.833 --> 00:18:51.466
Without Barrett
or Yuri's help,

00:18:51.466 --> 00:18:54.400
I'm not sure we'll be able
to capture that girl anymore.

00:18:54.400 --> 00:18:56.333
Let's retreat for now.

00:18:59.833 --> 00:19:03.033
Now you can focus
on defeating Sergey.

00:19:03.033 --> 00:19:04.866
Yeah! Thanks
for the help!

00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:07.100
I use Xiangke Magician's
Pendulum ability

00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:10.133
to change Dark Rebellion
Xyz Dragon's rank

00:19:10.133 --> 00:19:11.200
into a level!

00:19:14.833 --> 00:19:16.700
(grunting)

00:19:23.666 --> 00:19:24.933
(roaring)

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:29.766
Then his partner,
Xiangsheng Magician,

00:19:29.766 --> 00:19:31.266
will fire her mystical bow

00:19:31.266 --> 00:19:34.500
to make Dark Rebellion
have the same level as Odd‐Eyes.

00:19:35.933 --> 00:19:37.466
(grunting)

00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.633
(roaring)

00:19:48.133 --> 00:19:50.500
Since my two Dragons
have the same level,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:54.433
I can use them to build
the overlay network!

00:19:54.433 --> 00:19:56.966
Dragon with blazing,
raging eyes,

00:19:56.966 --> 00:20:00.033
come and conquer
all that stands against you!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:04.400
I Xyz Summon!

00:20:04.400 --> 00:20:07.133
Odd‐eyes Rebellion Dragon!

00:20:11.233 --> 00:20:13.733
Here we go, Sergey!

00:20:13.733 --> 00:20:15.400
Odd‐eyes Rebellion Dragon

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:19.500
attacks Earthbound Servant
Geo Gryphon!

00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:21.933
Sweeping Static Strike!

00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:25.666
(roaring)

00:20:27.533 --> 00:20:31.733
You have activated Geo Gryphon's
special ability.

00:20:31.733 --> 00:20:33.600
As a result
of its destruction,

00:20:33.600 --> 00:20:36.933
Odd‐eyes Rebellion Dragon
is also destroyed.

00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.033
With not a single monster
to defend with,

00:20:46.033 --> 00:20:48.866
all your life points
are ripe for the taking.

00:20:48.866 --> 00:20:51.766
Now finish that annoying pest,
Sergey.

00:20:51.766 --> 00:20:54.566
Geo Kraken,
attack Yuya directly

00:20:54.566 --> 00:20:57.966
and eliminate
his remaining life points.

00:20:57.966 --> 00:20:59.700
(roaring)

00:21:08.666 --> 00:21:11.633
(grunting and groaning)

00:21:11.633 --> 00:21:13.566
No. Yuya!

00:21:13.566 --> 00:21:14.866
Stop!

00:21:14.866 --> 00:21:16.233
Seize the girl, Sergey!

00:21:22.433 --> 00:21:23.500
Zuzu!

00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.933
(grunts)

00:21:27.933 --> 00:21:29.100
Aah!

00:21:32.666 --> 00:21:34.033
(grunts)
(whimpers)

00:21:35.366 --> 00:21:37.800
No! Zuzu!

00:21:40.766 --> 00:21:42.466
Zuzu!

00:21:42.466 --> 00:21:43.400
(gasps)

00:21:44.466 --> 00:21:47.100
(Zuzu)
Yuya!
