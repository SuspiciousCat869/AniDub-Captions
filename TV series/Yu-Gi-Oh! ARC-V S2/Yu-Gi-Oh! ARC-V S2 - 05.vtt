WEBVTT

00:00:00.766 --> 00:00:01.566
(clears throat)
(snoring)

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:02.666
Wakey, wakey.

00:00:02.666 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, anybody in there?

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.100
Hey, you snore
pretty loudly.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.733
Huh? Uh...
(grunting)

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:12.666
(groaning)

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:13.800
(loud thud)

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.466
Uh...

00:00:15.466 --> 00:00:18.866
You know, I only came over
to make sure you were okay.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:21.700
Guess getting a thank you is
totally out the question, huh?

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:23.000
Huh?

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:31.933
(groaning)
Good as new!

00:00:31.933 --> 00:00:34.166
She's purring
like a kitten now!

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:36.733
I thought I had to
replace the thrusters.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:39.200
Luckily, they just
needed to be recalibrated.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.733
Spare parts are hard
to come by around here.

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.433
And where is here?

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:45.100
This place...

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.966
is my home.

Welcome to
the Synchro Dimension!

00:01:57.566 --> 00:01:59.966
What?
The Synchro Dimension?

00:01:59.966 --> 00:02:03.000
But I'm supposed to be in
the middle of a battle royal!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.800
The last thing
I remember was...

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.200
This guy...

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.800
This guy who looked like
Yuya but a super evil,

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.433
creepy version of him,
was after me.

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.700
I thought I was toast,
but my bracelet

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.833
made him disappear
and then you showed up.

00:02:17.833 --> 00:02:20.100
Rin!

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.300
You're safe!

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.666
Uhh!

00:02:22.666 --> 00:02:24.633
Sorry, but, uh...

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.133
wrong girl.

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.133
What's that?
Now what's happening?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.266
(gasping)

00:02:31.266 --> 00:02:32.933
So that must be...

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:36.933
how I ended up in
the Synchro Dimension.

00:02:36.933 --> 00:02:38.966
Oh, yeah.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:41.933
Other than Yuto, Yuya said
there was another guy

00:02:41.933 --> 00:02:45.700
that looked just like him
from the Synchro Dimension.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.333
You're like Yuya's twin!

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.700
I mean triplet!

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.133
I mean quadruplet!

00:02:50.133 --> 00:02:51.433
What's your name again?

00:02:51.433 --> 00:02:53.366
Is it Yoyo?
Hmmph! Yo‐Yo?

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:56.933
Aah!
My name is Yugo!
Not Yo‐Yo.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:01.500
Get it right!
(groaning)

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.933
You really aren't Rin.
Huh?

00:03:03.933 --> 00:03:07.833
There's no way Rin would
ever get my name wrong.

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:09.400
Rin.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.600
Wow, nice moves there.

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.200
You remind me a bit
of Lulu and Rin.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.300
A lot, in fact.

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.266
Yugo...

00:03:19.266 --> 00:03:20.700
I wouldn't be surprised

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.333
if the guy who came
after me also took Rin.

00:03:23.333 --> 00:03:26.800
Hold up! You're telling me
you met the creep who has Rin!

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.866
I'm not 100%,
but this guy

00:03:28.866 --> 00:03:31.400
definitely had sleaze
written all over him.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.000
Who is this Rin person?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.900
How could you
let him go?

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.133
I'm sorry.

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:41.900
I wish I could have been
able to stop that guy,

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.633
but once my bracelet
came on, he vanished.

00:03:45.866 --> 00:03:47.733
It's really weird.

00:03:47.733 --> 00:03:49.933
Whenever it starts glowing,

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:51.666
it's always when
I'm with somebody

00:03:51.666 --> 00:03:53.833
who looks
just like Yuya.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:57.733
The first time it
happened, I was with Yuto.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:02.833
As soon as he disappeared,
Yuya showed up.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:05.566
That's why I thought
you were him.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.833
And then, when my bracelet
glowed with you there,

00:04:11.833 --> 00:04:14.500
I thought you'd vanish.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.633
But instead of you, it sent
me away for the first time!

00:04:18.633 --> 00:04:20.833
Away from my friends
and family...

00:04:20.833 --> 00:04:23.566
Well, until we find
you a way home,

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:27.933
New Domino City ain't a bad
place to be, most of the time.

00:04:27.933 --> 00:04:31.233
Check out that skyline‐‐
it's beautiful, right?

00:04:31.233 --> 00:04:32.833
And the parks...

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.900
They're amazing,
if you can get into them.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.600
Don't worry, you'll
get used to being here.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.200
I remember
how I freaked out

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:43.600
the first time I got
sent to another dimension.

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:46.900
It's a day
I won't ever forget.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.166
That's the day
I lost Rin Rin.

00:04:49.166 --> 00:04:51.633
We'd been best friends
since like forever.

00:04:51.633 --> 00:04:55.866
We were inseparable...
until we were separated.

00:05:00.833 --> 00:05:04.100
Looks like someone
found a dead end.

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.266
You're going
to come with me.

00:05:07.266 --> 00:05:10.533
You can do this the
easy way or the hard way.

00:05:10.533 --> 00:05:13.233
I hope
it's the hard way!

00:05:13.233 --> 00:05:15.033
(laughing)

00:05:17.133 --> 00:05:19.366
Come on, where are you?

00:05:19.366 --> 00:05:21.200
Rin!

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:22.266
Rin Rin!

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:28.766
Let her go, creep!

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:33.833
(laughing)

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:36.666
Don't do anything crazy,
you got that?

00:05:36.666 --> 00:05:40.833
I'm so sorry, but crazy
is what I do best!

00:05:40.833 --> 00:05:42.966
Buh‐bye!

00:05:42.966 --> 00:05:45.900
(groaning)

00:05:47.033 --> 00:05:48.200
Uhh!

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.133
Rin Rin!

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:51.066
(gasping)

00:05:51.066 --> 00:05:53.266
No way.

00:05:53.266 --> 00:05:55.733
(groaning)

00:05:55.733 --> 00:05:57.933
Rin!

00:05:57.933 --> 00:05:59.566
Uhh...

00:06:02.866 --> 00:06:04.000
Whoa!

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.766
What's going on?

00:06:05.766 --> 00:06:08.333
Uhh!

00:06:10.433 --> 00:06:13.100
Clear Wing Synchro Dragon?

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.433
Why are you glowing?

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.233
Huh?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:25.233
And the next thing
I knew,

00:06:25.233 --> 00:06:27.500
I was in
the Xyz Dimension.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.100
I've seen
some terrible things,

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.233
but nothing could
prepare me for what I saw.

00:06:45.191 --> 00:06:48.258
I found myself in a place
called Heartland City.

00:06:50.125 --> 00:06:53.191
This place
has seen better days.

00:06:53.191 --> 00:06:55.458
I didn't know
why I was sent there,

00:06:55.458 --> 00:06:57.191
but I had a feeling
it was so I could

00:06:57.191 --> 00:06:59.391
find Rin Rin
and bring her home.

00:07:03.691 --> 00:07:07.525
Rin Rin!
It's me, your best bud!

00:07:07.525 --> 00:07:09.591
I know you're around here!

00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:10.858
Rin!

00:07:11.991 --> 00:07:13.758
Hey!
Huh?

00:07:13.758 --> 00:07:17.125
It's you again!

00:07:17.125 --> 00:07:19.825
Give Rin back and I
might go easy on you.

00:07:19.825 --> 00:07:22.158
You threatening me?
Uhh!

00:07:22.158 --> 00:07:25.058
'Cause you and your
scooter don't scare me.

00:07:25.058 --> 00:07:26.825
Watch your words, pal!

00:07:26.825 --> 00:07:28.625
Nobody disses my ride!

00:07:28.625 --> 00:07:30.925
You've just started something
you can't finish!

00:07:32.858 --> 00:07:34.258
Bring it on!

00:07:36.725 --> 00:07:38.058
Aah!

00:07:39.658 --> 00:07:40.525
Let's duel!
Let's duel!

00:07:42.391 --> 00:07:45.725
You know who that guy
was, don't you?

00:07:45.725 --> 00:07:49.025
Yeah, the crazy creepazoid who
snatched Rin Rin away from me!

00:07:49.025 --> 00:07:52.458
I can't wait 'til I get another
shot at taking that guy down!

00:07:52.458 --> 00:07:55.058
You're wrong!
That guy was Yuto.

00:07:55.058 --> 00:07:58.091
He doesn't have Rin.
Yuto?

00:07:58.091 --> 00:07:59.925
That's right,
and he's on a mission

00:07:59.925 --> 00:08:02.658
to save his friend's
sister Lulu just like you.

00:08:02.658 --> 00:08:06.091
Yuto doesn't have any reason
to have taken your girlfriend.

00:08:06.091 --> 00:08:08.125
My... my girlfriend?

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:09.658
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:08:09.658 --> 00:08:11.158
Guess I just
thought Rin was‐‐

00:08:11.158 --> 00:08:12.525
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no.

00:08:12.525 --> 00:08:13.925
We're just
childhood friends!

00:08:13.925 --> 00:08:16.191
Imagine us, boyfriend
and girlfriend,

00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.058
going on dates
and walking together

00:08:18.058 --> 00:08:19.791
in the moonlight
and holding hands

00:08:19.791 --> 00:08:21.325
and laughing
and joking and‐‐
So, like...

00:08:21.325 --> 00:08:23.425
that's the first time you've
jumped through dimensions?

00:08:23.425 --> 00:08:24.858
Huh?

00:08:26.758 --> 00:08:30.425
Yeah, and this is what
gets me back and forth.

00:08:30.425 --> 00:08:31.791
Rin's out there somewhere

00:08:31.791 --> 00:08:35.491
and this card's gonna
help me find her.

00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:36.625
Uhh!

00:08:36.625 --> 00:08:39.191
Maybe that's why
it sent me to Heartland.

00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:40.925
Hey, I wonder...

00:08:40.925 --> 00:08:42.558
if you were sent
to Heartland

00:08:42.558 --> 00:08:44.125
because that maniac
was there too.

00:08:44.125 --> 00:08:45.825
And wouldn't it be creepy
if that guy

00:08:45.825 --> 00:08:47.725
was watching you duel
from the shadows?

00:08:47.725 --> 00:08:49.091
The only one missing

00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:52.891
from making that
a freaky foursome was Yuya.

00:08:52.891 --> 00:08:54.125
(gasping)

00:08:54.125 --> 00:08:56.025
You don't need
to be rocket scientist

00:08:56.025 --> 00:08:58.191
to know
that's no coincidence.

00:08:58.191 --> 00:09:00.925
You four are totally
linked together.

00:09:00.925 --> 00:09:03.391
Yeah. Maybe
you're on to something.

00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:06.391
Like we all got these
awesome dragons, too,

00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.525
so if it's not coincidence,
it must be some master plan,

00:09:09.525 --> 00:09:10.691
but what?

00:09:10.691 --> 00:09:12.191
I wish I knew,

00:09:12.191 --> 00:09:17.425
because I think
it involves me, too.

00:09:17.425 --> 00:09:19.325
Rin's not the only one
who looks like me.

00:09:19.325 --> 00:09:21.191
There are two other girls.

00:09:21.191 --> 00:09:24.758
I mentioned Lulu.
The other is Celina.

00:09:24.758 --> 00:09:27.391
Celina?
That's right.

00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:30.458
So then there's four of me
and four of you guys.

00:09:30.458 --> 00:09:32.958
What can all of this mean?

00:09:46.032 --> 00:09:48.565
Let's piece together
what we know.

00:09:48.565 --> 00:09:49.999
There are
four dimensions‐‐

00:09:49.999 --> 00:09:54.699
Fusion, Synchro,
Xyz, and Standard.

00:09:54.699 --> 00:09:57.165
Duel Academy is based
in the Fusion Dimension,

00:09:57.165 --> 00:09:58.565
and they're trying to unite

00:09:58.565 --> 00:10:00.865
all four dimensions
into one.

00:10:00.865 --> 00:10:02.932
Why would they do that?

00:10:02.932 --> 00:10:05.232
I don't know, but
they leave devastation

00:10:05.232 --> 00:10:06.799
and destruction
in their wake.

00:10:06.799 --> 00:10:09.332
So, they must have
destroyed Heartland.

00:10:09.332 --> 00:10:12.165
And if that girl Celina
is from Fusion,

00:10:12.165 --> 00:10:15.465
she's responsible for what
happened to Rin Rin as well.

00:10:15.465 --> 00:10:18.599
Not exactly.
Duel Academy's after her too.

00:10:18.599 --> 00:10:21.165
Wait, what?
But why?

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:25.065
Duel Academy's leader is a man
they call "The Professor."

00:10:25.065 --> 00:10:27.199
He's the one who gave
the order to capture girls

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:29.965
who look like me,
like Lulu and Rin.

00:10:29.965 --> 00:10:32.832
So Celina's in danger, too.

00:10:34.365 --> 00:10:37.032
But I still don't
understand why the Professor

00:10:37.032 --> 00:10:39.299
wants to bring
the four of us together.

00:10:39.299 --> 00:10:42.365
What makes you,
what makes me,

00:10:42.365 --> 00:10:44.765
what makes
any of us so special?

00:10:44.765 --> 00:10:47.432
Let's find out.
(gasping)

00:10:47.432 --> 00:10:51.032
You said Rin's at that
Duel Academy place, right?

00:10:54.132 --> 00:10:55.165
Let's go.

00:10:55.165 --> 00:10:56.699
Let's go where?

00:10:56.699 --> 00:10:58.432
Duel Academy!

00:10:58.432 --> 00:11:00.165
That's where Rin is,
right?

00:11:00.165 --> 00:11:03.399
So we'll just go
and bring her back!

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:05.432
Yugo, it isn't
that simple!

00:11:05.432 --> 00:11:06.599
How would we
even get there?

00:11:06.599 --> 00:11:09.799
Our ticket's right here!

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.932
This bracelet's what
transported us here, isn't it?

00:11:12.932 --> 00:11:15.332
If it took me and you
to this dimension,

00:11:15.332 --> 00:11:17.465
it can take us
to Duel Academy!

00:11:17.465 --> 00:11:21.265
All we gotta do
is make it glow!

00:11:21.265 --> 00:11:22.799
Won't work.

00:11:22.799 --> 00:11:23.932
But why?

00:11:23.932 --> 00:11:25.932
I don't control it.

00:11:25.932 --> 00:11:28.932
I'm not the one
who makes it glow.
Uhh!

00:11:28.932 --> 00:11:30.665
The bracelet
only lights up

00:11:30.665 --> 00:11:32.332
when there are
two Yuyas around,

00:11:32.332 --> 00:11:34.799
and there's
only one of you.

00:11:37.332 --> 00:11:40.065
Then get on the
interdimensional hotline

00:11:40.065 --> 00:11:41.232
and call him or something!

00:11:41.232 --> 00:11:44.132
I can't.

00:11:44.132 --> 00:11:46.865
Is it because
you can't or won't?

00:11:46.865 --> 00:11:49.032
It's because...

00:11:49.032 --> 00:11:50.932
Because...

00:11:50.932 --> 00:11:53.099
Yuya...

00:11:53.099 --> 00:11:55.832
Don't you think
I'd try if I could?

00:11:55.832 --> 00:11:57.832
(crying)

00:12:02.065 --> 00:12:04.865
(sobbing)

00:12:10.099 --> 00:12:14.499
Uh... here.

00:12:16.732 --> 00:12:18.232
Don't worry.

00:12:18.232 --> 00:12:19.999
I promise it's clean.

00:12:21.665 --> 00:12:23.565
Thanks, Yugo.

00:12:23.565 --> 00:12:25.565
Yugo, you did it again.

00:12:25.565 --> 00:12:29.399
You're an expert at two things‐‐
dueling and making girls cry.

00:12:29.399 --> 00:12:32.799
If I could use this bracelet
to go where ever I wanted to,

00:12:32.799 --> 00:12:34.032
I'd go home...

00:12:34.032 --> 00:12:38.232
to Yuya, Dad,
and all my friends.

00:12:39.665 --> 00:12:41.132
My bracelet
might be a dead end,

00:12:41.132 --> 00:12:42.465
but maybe you could
use your card

00:12:42.465 --> 00:12:44.365
to transport us
to Fusion.

00:12:44.365 --> 00:12:47.132
I wish. But it's
like your bracelet.

00:12:47.132 --> 00:12:49.932
It just works whenever
it wants to.

00:12:54.299 --> 00:12:57.065
I'm sorry
I got you upset.

00:12:57.065 --> 00:12:59.132
You see,
Rin always told me

00:12:59.132 --> 00:13:01.365
that my mouth
needed a speed bump.

00:13:01.365 --> 00:13:02.565
(laughing)

00:13:02.565 --> 00:13:04.132
She'd tell me to,
"Think about it,

00:13:04.132 --> 00:13:05.632
before you speak
about it."

00:13:05.632 --> 00:13:09.199
She could be harsh,
but she was right.

00:13:09.199 --> 00:13:12.999
Rin was always like "wear your
helmet," "clean your Runner."

00:13:12.999 --> 00:13:16.099
(laughing)
She sounds like a handful.

00:13:16.099 --> 00:13:18.799
Kinda reminds me of you.
Oh?

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:21.932
Careful!
Watch yourself!

00:13:23.132 --> 00:13:25.599
Don't touch that!

00:13:25.599 --> 00:13:27.865
Oh, no!
It's full of germs!

00:13:27.865 --> 00:13:29.499
What's the deal, Yugo?

00:13:31.865 --> 00:13:36.165
Someone help! Intruders in
our park, our lovely park!

00:13:36.165 --> 00:13:38.399
Yugo?
Let's go!

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.532
What?

00:13:39.532 --> 00:13:42.365
Over there!
There were two of them.

00:13:42.365 --> 00:13:44.365
Two Commons!

00:13:44.365 --> 00:13:46.265
Huh?
Uhh!

00:13:46.265 --> 00:13:48.499
How did you two
sneak in here?

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:50.832
The Villa is
for Topsiders only!

00:13:50.832 --> 00:13:52.865
Get on!
Hurry!

00:13:52.865 --> 00:13:54.065
We've got trespassers
here!

00:13:54.065 --> 00:13:55.232
Can we chat
before we go splat?

00:13:55.232 --> 00:13:57.365
Just do what I tell you!

00:13:57.365 --> 00:13:59.365
(engine revs)

00:13:59.365 --> 00:14:00.632
Call Sector Security!

00:14:16.176 --> 00:14:19.242
So, why did we have to
get out of there so fast?

00:14:19.242 --> 00:14:21.942
It's my fault. I knew we
shouldn't have stayed there.

00:14:21.942 --> 00:14:23.442
We were in a restricted,

00:14:23.442 --> 00:14:26.276
tops‐only area
that's off limits to us.

00:14:26.276 --> 00:14:29.209
Topsiders are the haves
of society who possess

00:14:29.209 --> 00:14:32.142
all the wealth and power
here in New Domino City.

00:14:32.142 --> 00:14:33.976
Doesn't seem fair.

00:14:33.976 --> 00:14:36.376
Trust me, it isn't,
and I'm not gonna rest

00:14:36.376 --> 00:14:39.742
until I make things
better for everybody.

00:14:39.742 --> 00:14:42.209
Here, the winners
get to keep everything,

00:14:42.209 --> 00:14:44.309
and the losers
are left with nothing.

00:14:44.309 --> 00:14:46.776
And the Topsiders get to
make all the rules.

00:14:46.776 --> 00:14:48.409
What?
That's awful!

00:14:48.409 --> 00:14:49.976
It is if you're a Common,

00:14:49.976 --> 00:14:52.476
but the Topsiders
like it just fine.

00:14:52.476 --> 00:14:54.342
In fact, they love it.

00:14:54.342 --> 00:14:57.576
They're only a fraction
of the City's population,

00:14:57.576 --> 00:15:01.476
but they're just as rich as
everybody else put together.

00:15:01.476 --> 00:15:02.909
No!

00:15:09.342 --> 00:15:10.642
(gasping)

00:15:17.609 --> 00:15:20.209
Oh, my!
(laughing)

00:15:20.209 --> 00:15:22.276
Yeah.
Pretty impressive, right?

00:15:22.276 --> 00:15:25.709
It's like a fantasyland
up here.

00:15:27.342 --> 00:15:28.676
Huh?

00:15:28.676 --> 00:15:31.009
But down there,
where I live...

00:15:32.276 --> 00:15:33.642
(gasping)

00:15:36.109 --> 00:15:39.042
...it's a different world.

00:15:40.176 --> 00:15:42.076
Huh?

00:15:42.076 --> 00:15:45.309
That's the area where
us Commons have to live.

00:15:45.309 --> 00:15:47.909
It's not much, but it's
got everything I need.

00:15:47.909 --> 00:15:49.376
(gasping)

00:15:49.376 --> 00:15:53.276
Topsiders call the people
who live here "Commons."

00:15:53.276 --> 00:15:55.842
The Topsiders act as if
we're their equals,

00:15:55.842 --> 00:15:58.376
but in their hearts,
it's not even close.

00:15:58.376 --> 00:16:02.942
If we disappeared,
they wouldn't blink an eye.

00:16:02.942 --> 00:16:06.842
Ever since I was a kid, it was
my goal to change our world...

00:16:06.842 --> 00:16:10.009
I Synchro Summon
Hi‐Speedroid Kendama!

00:16:10.009 --> 00:16:13.042
Oh, yeah?
I summon Lucky Pied Piper!

00:16:13.042 --> 00:16:14.376
(both laughing)

00:16:14.376 --> 00:16:17.109
There's only one way
to get out of the slums,

00:16:17.109 --> 00:16:20.476
and it's to win, so Rin
and I decided from the start

00:16:20.476 --> 00:16:24.076
that our dueling skills
would make us winners.

00:16:29.242 --> 00:16:32.009
And we'll never stop trying.

00:16:32.009 --> 00:16:34.909
That's how you go from
being a zero to a hero‐‐

00:16:34.909 --> 00:16:36.709
just like him.
Huh?

00:16:41.276 --> 00:16:44.142
The Master of Faster,
Jack Atlas.

00:16:44.142 --> 00:16:46.642
He was the first and
only duelist from Commons

00:16:46.642 --> 00:16:48.176
to ever win the
Friendship Cup,

00:16:48.176 --> 00:16:50.209
the biggest tournament
in the whole world!

00:16:50.209 --> 00:16:53.076
No one in the city ever
expected a Commons to win,

00:16:53.076 --> 00:16:54.776
but he showed them wrong!

00:16:54.776 --> 00:16:57.176
When Jack Atlas
won the Friendship Cup,

00:16:57.176 --> 00:16:59.576
it gave all Commons
something we can shoot for,

00:16:59.576 --> 00:17:01.709
and if he could
start off in the slums

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:03.842
and reach the top,
so can I.

00:17:03.842 --> 00:17:05.642
Me and Rin,
we looked up to him

00:17:05.642 --> 00:17:07.176
as something
more than a champion.

00:17:07.176 --> 00:17:09.976
He's what we wanted to be.

00:17:11.976 --> 00:17:13.242
I see.

00:17:13.242 --> 00:17:15.609
That's why we
built this Duel Runner‐‐

00:17:15.609 --> 00:17:19.309
so that someday we could
enter the Friendship Cup.

00:17:19.309 --> 00:17:22.042
Turbo dueling Jack
would be a dream come true.

00:17:22.042 --> 00:17:23.876
What's a Turbo Duel?

00:17:23.876 --> 00:17:26.476
This is Sector Security.

00:17:26.476 --> 00:17:28.076
The white Duel Runner...

00:17:28.076 --> 00:17:29.709
Pull over immediately!

00:17:29.709 --> 00:17:32.742
I said, pull over!
Now!

00:17:32.742 --> 00:17:35.709
Those stuck‐up Topsiders
must've reported us!

00:17:38.342 --> 00:17:41.009
Maybe you should pull
over like he told you to!

00:17:41.009 --> 00:17:43.376
Maybe it's just
your taillight is out.

00:17:43.376 --> 00:17:45.142
You don't know
about security!

00:17:45.142 --> 00:17:47.076
The Topsiders
do whatever it takes

00:17:47.076 --> 00:17:48.509
to make sure we stay put!

00:17:48.509 --> 00:17:50.842
I'm sure you could
talk it through.

00:17:50.842 --> 00:17:53.009
We'd get taken
to The Facility.

00:17:53.009 --> 00:17:54.276
The Facility?

00:17:54.276 --> 00:17:55.576
Yeah, it's a like a jail,

00:17:55.576 --> 00:17:57.076
but that's making it
sound nice.

00:17:57.076 --> 00:17:58.642
The only thing worse
than the smell,

00:17:58.642 --> 00:18:00.509
the food, and the cells
are the guards.

00:18:00.509 --> 00:18:02.109
That place takes miserable

00:18:02.109 --> 00:18:04.076
and super‐sizes it
to a whole new level.

00:18:04.076 --> 00:18:05.576
That sounds horrible!

00:18:05.576 --> 00:18:07.142
That's too nice a word.

00:18:07.142 --> 00:18:10.009
And nice has no place
in The Facility.

00:18:16.576 --> 00:18:19.042
We've got a Duel Runner
fleeing on Route 8,

00:18:19.042 --> 00:18:21.676
with Sector Security
currently in hot pursuit.

00:18:21.676 --> 00:18:25.476
Officer reports the Duel Runner
is defying orders to stop.

00:18:25.476 --> 00:18:27.576
Officer requests
permission to engage.

00:18:27.576 --> 00:18:30.509
Officer request is approved.

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.609
You have my permission to
do whatever is necessary

00:18:33.609 --> 00:18:37.042
to subdue those
who defy Security.

00:18:37.042 --> 00:18:38.442
Understood.

00:18:38.442 --> 00:18:40.942
I get the message
loud and clear, sir.

00:18:40.942 --> 00:18:44.409
I activate the Field Spell
Speed World Neo!

00:18:45.476 --> 00:18:47.609
Duel Mode engaged.

00:18:53.009 --> 00:18:54.976
Auto‐pilot activated.

00:18:54.976 --> 00:18:56.642
What's going on?

00:18:56.642 --> 00:18:59.009
He's forcing us to duel,
and if we lose,

00:18:59.009 --> 00:19:00.242
he'll arrest
the both of us.

00:19:00.242 --> 00:19:01.742
Me, too?

00:19:01.742 --> 00:19:04.109
(siren)

00:19:04.109 --> 00:19:07.376
It's duel time!

00:19:07.376 --> 00:19:09.709
A Turbo Duel
is about to commence.

00:19:09.709 --> 00:19:12.076
A Turbo Duel is
about to commence.

00:19:12.076 --> 00:19:14.209
Combat Lane
transfiguration underway.

00:19:14.209 --> 00:19:15.709
All non‐dueling vehicles

00:19:15.709 --> 00:19:19.076
must vacate
the Combat Lane immediately.

00:19:19.076 --> 00:19:21.042
A Turbo Duel
is about to commence.

00:19:21.042 --> 00:19:23.176
Combat Lane
transfiguration underway.

00:19:23.176 --> 00:19:24.576
All non‐dueling vehicles

00:19:24.576 --> 00:19:26.576
must vacate
the Combat Lane immediately.

00:19:26.576 --> 00:19:29.109
I never did ask you...

00:19:29.109 --> 00:19:31.209
I never did ask you
about your name.

00:19:31.209 --> 00:19:34.142
Oh, it's Zuzu‐‐
Zuzu Boyle!

00:19:34.142 --> 00:19:37.109
Well, get ready for
the ride of your life, Zuzu!

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:40.409
Hold on tight 'cause
we're going supersonic!

00:19:45.642 --> 00:19:51.676
Don't you think maybe you
should slow down a bit?

00:19:51.676 --> 00:19:52.742
Waah!

00:19:52.742 --> 00:19:53.942
Slow down?

00:19:53.942 --> 00:19:55.476
But where's
the fun in that?

00:20:01.709 --> 00:20:02.709
Pull over!

00:20:02.709 --> 00:20:03.976
Don't think so!

00:20:07.376 --> 00:20:10.842
Escape isn't an option.

00:20:10.842 --> 00:20:13.142
Me, run?

00:20:13.142 --> 00:20:15.942
No chance!

00:20:17.909 --> 00:20:18.942
