00:18:16.966 --> 00:18:18.533
And since Frightfur Sanctuary

00:18:18.533 --> 00:18:20.900
treats Triple Ancient Gear
Hunting Hound

00:18:20.900 --> 00:18:22.400
as a Frightfur monster,

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:25.766
Frightfur Tiger's special
ability kicks in again,

00:18:25.766 --> 00:18:29.533
giving all my monsters
more attack points!

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:34.466
This is a catastrophe!

00:18:34.466 --> 00:18:37.733
Duh! Frightfur Chimera,
how about we

00:18:37.733 --> 00:18:40.733
give his three‐headed freak
a thorough thrashing!

00:18:40.733 --> 00:18:41.666
Attack!

00:18:47.566 --> 00:18:49.500
(groaning)

00:18:51.366 --> 00:18:54.200
And like last time,
your Hunting Hound

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:55.833
is summoned onto my field,

00:18:55.833 --> 00:19:00.200
giving Frightfur Chimera
300 more attack points.

00:19:02.466 --> 00:19:06.100
And Frightfur Sanctuary
and Frightfur Tiger

00:19:06.100 --> 00:19:08.733
do their magic again,
stuffing my monsters

00:19:08.733 --> 00:19:11.500
with lots of attack points.

00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:14.733
Guys, I have one attack
left, and this attack

00:19:14.733 --> 00:19:17.766
will be much sweeter than
the lollypop in my mouth!

00:19:20.233 --> 00:19:24.200
(groaning)

00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.700
Here, poochy poochy.

00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.500
Come on over
to my side of the field.

00:19:38.166 --> 00:19:39.700
I can't believe this!

00:19:39.700 --> 00:19:42.233
Sora has taken
all of our monsters!

00:19:42.233 --> 00:19:44.266
One from each of us!

00:19:44.266 --> 00:19:46.900
Hey, you're right.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.000
Wouldn't it be funny if
I used them to defeat you?

00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.300
(all gasping)

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:55.566
Looks like you're all
bark and I'm all bite!

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.566
(whimpering)

00:20:03.566 --> 00:20:09.100
(screaming)

00:20:11.700 --> 00:20:16.100
They won't be
bothering us anymore...

00:20:16.100 --> 00:20:17.800
right?

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:20.700
Yes.

00:20:20.700 --> 00:20:22.966
Though we may still
have our differences,

00:20:22.966 --> 00:20:24.933
you did save me
on this day.

00:20:24.933 --> 00:20:27.633
Thank you, Sora.
Mm‐hmm.

00:20:27.633 --> 00:20:30.000
Do you have any idea
where Celina is?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:31.766
I need to find her
and fast!

00:20:31.766 --> 00:20:35.033
Yes. Unfortunately,
she is in grave danger.

00:20:35.033 --> 00:20:36.700
She is weak
and unable to fight,

00:20:36.700 --> 00:20:38.833
so Riley stayed with her,
but I fear

00:20:38.833 --> 00:20:41.466
that Riley cannot
protect her forever.

00:20:41.466 --> 00:20:44.766
That flare I saw‐‐ Obelisk
Force knows where she is.

00:20:44.766 --> 00:20:47.633
Then their situation
is more dire than ever.

00:20:47.633 --> 00:20:50.766
All right. Then I'd
better help even the odds.

00:20:50.766 --> 00:20:54.600
You get backup and I'll get
to kicking some Obelisk butt.

00:20:56.733 --> 00:20:58.766
(groaning)

00:21:01.733 --> 00:21:05.666
(panting)

00:21:09.033 --> 00:21:11.600
They just keep coming.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.000
(whimpering)

00:21:19.533 --> 00:21:21.800
(whimpering)

00:21:25.466 --> 00:21:29.366
(whimpering)

00:21:29.366 --> 00:21:33.000
Riley... you... okay?

00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:34.700
(whimpering)

00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:40.733
(Yuya)
Riley! You in here?

00:21:40.733 --> 00:21:42.566
Don't worry!
I'm coming to help!

00:21:42.566 --> 00:21:44.500
Aah
(Yuya)
Riley!

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:45.900
(groaning)

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.866
Riley!

00:21:48.866 --> 00:21:51.800
