DID YOU HEAR WHAT I SAID,
INUYASHA?

3
00:01:57,006 --> 00:01:58,039
- PUT A CORK IN IT.

4
00:01:58,072 --> 00:01:59,806
JUST GET IT OVER WITH AND GO.

5
00:01:59,839 --> 00:02:00,839
- EVERY TIME YOU TWO RETURN,

6
00:02:00,872 --> 00:02:03,006
IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE IN
THE MIDDLE OF AN ARGUMENT.

7
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,572
- COULD YOU PLEASE TAKE CARE
OF EVERYONE ELSE, KAEDE?

8
00:02:07,606 --> 00:02:08,839
- HMM!

9
00:02:08,872 --> 00:02:11,839

TO LET HER LEAVE, INUYASHA?

10

YOU CAN BE A REAL JERK.

ONLY REASON
I STOPPED ARGUING WITH YOU

14
00:02:22,972 --> 00:02:23,839
WAS BECAUSE I WAS WORRIED

OK, KAGOME?

ALWAYS BEEN THE JEALOUS TYPE

- INUYASHA'S JUST BEING...PETTY.

THAT'S THE ONLY REASON

25
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:47,839
WHY HE TOOK KOGA'S WORD

26
00:02:47,872 --> 00:02:48,806
SO SERIOUSLY.

27

I NEEDED TO HEAR THAT,

BUT THE REAL REASON
I'M GOING BACK

30

IS TO GET SOME MORE BANDAGES

I'M COMING RIGHT BACK,

YOU'RE SO INTERESTED IN ME,

BUT MAYBE THE REASON I CAN'T

86
00:06:13,806 --> 00:06:17,039
IS BECAUSE THE HEART OF ONIGUMO
STILL BEATS WITHIN ME,

AND YET YEARNED FOR KIKYO
TO SUCH A DEGREE

THAT HE OFFERED HIS BODY
UP TO A HOST OF DEMONS,

TO BE REBORN AS MYSELF.

00:11:09,872 --> 00:11:11,739
WITHOUT HER
HANGING AROUND ANYWAY.

162
00:11:11,772 --> 00:11:12,772
- IF THAT'S THE CASE,

163
00:11:12,806 --> 00:11:14,739
THEN WOULD YOU MIND
DOING US ALL A FAVOR

164
00:11:14,772 --> 00:11:16,672
AND STOP THAT NERVOUS FIDGETING?

165
00:11:16,706 --> 00:11:19,239
IT'S INCREDIBLY IRRITATING.

166
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:20,739
- HMM.

167
00:11:21,872 --> 00:11:22,806
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE TO SAY

168
00:11:22,839 --> 00:11:25,072
THAT KAGOME HAS
THE PATIENCE OF A SAINT,

169
00:11:25,106 --> 00:11:25,806
PUTTING UP WITH YOU.

170
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:28,639
- I COULDN'T AGREE
WITH YOU MORE.

171

- BUT THE REAL REASON
I'M GOING BACK

172
00:11:32,239 --> 00:11:35,306
IS TO GET SOME MORE BANDAGES
AND MEDICINE FOR US TO USE.

173
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:39,139
I'M COMING RIGHT BACK,
BUT DON'T TELL INUYASHA THAT.

174
00:11:39,172 --> 00:11:39,872
- HUH?

175
00:11:39,906 --> 00:11:40,939
- SOMETIMES IT'S GOOD

176
00:11:40,972 --> 00:11:42,472
TO MAKE HIM WORRY A LITTLE.

177
00:11:42,506 --> 00:11:46,639

THAT I'D KEEP QUIET.

THERE'S NO NEED
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT HER.

YOU'RE TALKING AS IF
IT WAS ALL MY FAULT

185
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:59,939
THAT SHE DECIDED
TO GET UP AND LEAVE.

186
00:11:59,972 --> 00:12:02,339
WELL, I WON'T APOLOGIZE.

ALL THE BLAME.

THAT WAS WRONG, ANYWAY?

OH.

I DON'T BELIEVE THIS!

252
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:06,765
WHY DIDN'T YOU WAKE ME UP,
FOR CRYING OUT LOUD?!

- WE DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE STILL SLEEPING.

- WHAT'S THAT?

256
00:16:18,798 --> 00:16:20,165
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING, INUYASHA?

257
00:16:20,198 --> 00:16:23,765
- I WAS THINKING HOW WE REALLY
HAVEN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH

258
00:16:23,798 --> 00:16:26,265
CONSIDERING 50 YEARS

I'VE CHANGED A LOT.

00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:32,831
SINCE THAT TIME, LONG AGO,

262
00:16:32,865 --> 00:16:35,398
WHEN I SEALED YOU
TO THIS TREE WE'RE UNDER.

263
00:16:35,431 --> 00:16:37,431
- IT WAS BECAUSE
OF NARAKU'S DECEPTIONS

264
00:16:37,465 --> 00:16:38,498
THAT WE HATED EACH OTHER.

265
00:16:38,531 --> 00:16:42,831
SO MUCH THAT YOU TRAPPED ME
HERE FOR 50 YEARS,

266
00:16:42,865 --> 00:16:44,898
AND THEN YOU DIED.

267
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:51,065
KIKYO, BE HONEST.
HAVE I CHANGED?

268
00:16:56,031 --> 00:16:57,498
BEFORE I KNEW
OF NARAKU'S EXISTENCE,

269
00:16:57,531 --> 00:17:01,698
THERE WAS NO DOUBT THAT
I BURNED WITH RESENTMENT
OVER WHAT YOU'D DONE TO ME,

270
00:17:01,731 --> 00:17:05,765
BUT THEN YOU TOLD ME
THAT MY LIFE WAS YOURS,

271
00:17:05,798 --> 00:17:10,698
AND YOURS IS MINE.

272
00:17:10,731 --> 00:17:12,198
- AH!

273
00:17:13,231 --> 00:17:18,265
- IT SEEMS YOU'RE
NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM
NARAKU AFTER ALL.

274
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:19,665
- YOU'RE SAYING

275
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,631
I'M THE SAME AS NARAKU?

276
00:17:21,665 --> 00:17:22,698
- DEEP WITHIN NARAKU,

277
00:17:22,731 --> 00:17:26,898
ONIGUMO'S HEART BEATS
AND STILL YEARNS FOR MY TOUCH.

278
00:17:26,931 --> 00:17:29,365
- ONIGUMO'S HEART?

279
00:17:29,398 --> 00:17:30,298
- HE DESIRED ME,

280
00:17:30,331 --> 00:17:33,365
AND HAVING ME KILL YOU
WITH MY OWN TWO HANDS

281
00:17:33,398 --> 00:17:35,265
WAS SOMETHING THAT
HE DREAMED ABOUT.

282
00:17:35,298 --> 00:17:40,831
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT
THE JEALOUS HEART OF
ONIGUMO SCHEMED FOR.

283
00:17:42,365 --> 00:17:45,831
- HE WAS JEALOUS OVER
SOMETHING SO RIDICULOUS?

284
00:17:45,865 --> 00:17:52,498
- YES, RIDICULOUS,
BUT THAT'S WHAT MORTALS ARE.

285
00:17:53,131 --> 00:17:57,098
- ONIGUMO'S HEART
REMAINS INSIDE NARAKU.

286
00:17:57,131 --> 00:18:01,598
WAIT. KIKYO, DOES NARAKU HAVE
FEELINGS FOR YOU, TOO, NOW?

287
00:18:01,631 --> 00:18:03,798
- HE IS RELUCTANT TO ADMIT IT,

288
00:18:03,831 --> 00:18:07,998
BUT I AM CERTAIN THAT HE HAS
A LINGERING DESIRE FOR ME,

289
00:18:08,031 --> 00:18:10,531
AND IN AN EFFORT
TO EASE THAT FEELING,

290
00:18:10,565 --> 00:18:12,765
HE'S TRYING TO GET RID OF ME.

291
00:18:13,398 --> 00:18:14,865
- GRR!

292
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,731
- ENOUGH TALK, INUYASHA.

293
00:18:21,765 --> 00:18:24,931
THESE SOULS HAVE
FULLY REJUVENATED ME.

294
00:18:24,965 --> 00:18:28,131
- KIKYO, YOU AREN'T
ACTUALLY PLANNING

295
00:18:28,165 --> 00:18:30,731
TO CONFRONT NARAKU
BY YOURSELF, ARE YOU?

296
00:18:30,765 --> 00:18:32,165
YOU'RE NOT STRONG ENOUGH,

297
00:18:32,198 --> 00:18:36,098
AND I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT
HE MIGHT BE IN LOVE WITH YOU.

298
00:18:36,131 --> 00:18:38,198
IT'S TOO MUCH TO BEAR!

OH, WELL.

303
00:18:45,231 --> 00:18:49,831

YOU FEEL ABOUT ME NOW.

311

BUT I SWEAR I WON'T LET

YOU WON'T HAVE TO FIGHT ANYMORE.

316
00:19:54,765 --> 00:19:58,198
I WILL PROTECT YOU.

00:20:11,865 --> 00:20:15,098
- ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF HOW MEN
ARE PATHETIC FOOLS.

322
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:18,065
YOU HAVE THIS BELIEF
THAT ONCE YOU EMBRACE A WOMAN,

323
00:20:18,098 --> 00:20:19,498
SHE BELONGS TO YOU.

324
00:20:19,531 --> 00:20:20,431
- LISTEN--

325
00:20:20,465 --> 00:20:21,465
- DON'T MOVE.

326
00:20:21,498 --> 00:20:23,898
I'VE LEARNED SOMETHING
FROM WATCHING YOU JUST NOW.

327
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,831
AS LONG AS THE HEART OF
THE WEAK AND PATHETIC ONIGUMO

328
00:20:27,865 --> 00:20:29,431
BEATS WITHIN NARAKU,

329
00:20:29,465 --> 00:20:31,965
THERE WILL BE
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR ME,

330
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,398
AND THAT WILL GIVE ME
THE CHANCE I NEED

331
00:20:34,431 --> 00:20:36,631
TO TOTALLY DESTROY NARAKU.

332
00:20:36,665 --> 00:20:38,165
- KIKYO.

333
00:20:39,265 --> 00:20:41,198
- [WIND BLOWING]

334
00:20:41,231 --> 00:20:44,498
- KIKYO, DON'T GO!

335
00:20:45,931 --> 00:20:48,865
- ONCE THE THREADS
OF FATE ARE TANGLED,

336
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:51,365
THEY CANNOT BE UNDONE.

337
00:20:53,765 --> 00:20:57,031
- KIKYO!

338
00:20:59,798 --> 00:21:02,365
- [THUNDER]

339
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:11,398
- ENVY, A MORTAL EMOTION

340
00:21:11,431 --> 00:21:15,865
LEAKING FROM THE HEART
OF THAT SIMPERING FOOL ONIGUMO.

341
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:17,698
NEVER.

342
00:21:19,131 --> 00:21:21,465
AH.

343
00:21:27,598 --> 00:21:30,331
- THOSE LIGHTS ARE
DISCONNECTED SOULS.

344
00:21:30,365 --> 00:21:32,231
- MY SISTER KIKYO.

345
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:35,031
SHE'S SOMEWHERE NEARBY.

346
00:21:46,265 --> 00:21:47,898
- HUH?

347
00:21:47,931 --> 00:21:50,498
- [RUSTLING]

348
00:21:54,165 --> 00:21:56,498
- KAGOME.

349
00:21:56,531 --> 00:21:58,298
SO SHE WAS WATCHING.

350
00:21:58,331 --> 00:22:02,431
- INUYASHA IS LOOKING
STRAIGHT AT ME.

351
00:22:02,465 --> 00:22:03,598
WHY?

352
00:22:03,631 --> 00:22:05,631
WHY DOESN'T HE LOOK AWAY?

353
00:22:05,665 --> 00:22:07,731
WHAT IS HE THINKING?

354
00:22:30,696 --> 00:22:33,463
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

355
00:23:54,963 --> 00:23:58,996
- NOW THAT INUYASHA
HAS SWORN TO PROTECT KIKYO,

356
00:23:59,029 --> 00:24:00,529
I CAN'T STAY WITH HIM ANYMORE.

357
00:24:00,563 --> 00:24:03,663
BUT ONLY AFTER I'VE RUN BACK
TO THE PRESENT DO I REALIZE

358
00:24:03,696 --> 00:24:05,496
THAT I STILL HAVE A SHARD
OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

359
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:08,996
I KNOW FULL WELL THAT I SHOULD
RETURN IT TO THE FEUDAL ERA,

360
00:24:09,029 --> 00:24:13,696
BUT I ALSO REALIZE THAT IT MEANS
THE END OF MY ADVENTURES.

361
00:24:13,729 --> 00:24:14,463
TORN BY INDECISION,

362
00:24:14,496 --> 00:24:16,129
I STAND IN FRONT
OF THE SACRED TREE

363
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,429
WHERE I FIRST MET INUYASHA.

364
00:24:18,463 --> 00:24:22,363
NEXT TIME,
"BACK TO WHERE WE FIRST MET."

365
00:24:22,396 --> 00:24:23,396
SEE YOU SOON!
