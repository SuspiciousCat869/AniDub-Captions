160
00:11:23,794 --> 00:11:26,161
- THE SCENT OF A DEAD MAN.

161
00:11:26,194 --> 00:11:28,227
- A DEAD MAN?

162
00:11:28,261 --> 00:11:30,527
- [GROANING]

163
00:11:30,561 --> 00:11:31,461
- HUH?

164
00:11:31,494 --> 00:11:32,561
- A DEMON HAS COME.

165
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:35,927
IT DEVOURED THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.

166
00:11:35,961 --> 00:11:36,827
- DEMON?

167
00:11:36,861 --> 00:11:40,161
- ON ITS BACK
WAS THE MARK OF THE SPIDER.

168
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,094
- SPIDER?

169
00:11:41,127 --> 00:11:43,661
- ANOTHER REINCARNATION
OF NARAKU.

170
00:11:43,694 --> 00:11:46,794
- PLEASE HELP ME. UH!

171
00:11:46,827 --> 00:11:48,061
- [GASPS]

172
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:51,061
HAS THAT MAN BEEN DEAD
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING?

173
00:11:51,094 --> 00:11:56,094
- KAGURA MUST HAVE BEEN
CONTROLLING HIS BODY WITH
HER DANCE OF THE DEAD.

174
00:11:56,127 --> 00:11:57,327
IT HAS TO BE A TRAP.

175
00:11:57,361 --> 00:12:01,527
- YEAH, A TRAP SET TO FORCE ME
TO MEET THE THIRD DEMON.

176
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,094
- ARE YOU GOING?
DON'T FALL FOR HER TRICKS.

177
00:12:04,127 --> 00:12:08,427
YOUR WOUNDS ARE STILL
FAR TOO SERIOUS.

178
00:12:08,461 --> 00:12:10,627
- I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE.

179
00:12:10,661 --> 00:12:12,527
- SHE SENT THE DEAD MAN TO US,

180
00:12:12,561 --> 00:12:15,594
WHICH MEANS THAT KAGURA KNOWS
WHERE WE'RE HIDING.

181
00:12:15,627 --> 00:12:20,027
- YES, AND THERE WILL BE
NO CHANCE OF FLEEING.

182
00:12:20,061 --> 00:12:21,227
- I'LL GO AFTER HIM.

183
00:12:21,261 --> 00:12:26,727
HUH! THE DEMON WAS BOUND TO
ATTACK US HERE SOONER OR LATER.

184
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:28,661
- [SQUAWKS]

185
00:12:28,694 --> 00:12:32,261
- IT'S JUST A FEW CHILDREN.
LET THEM GO.

186
00:12:32,294 --> 00:12:36,494
- NARAKU COMMANDED ME
TO DEVOUR THE ENTIRE VILLAGE,

187
00:12:36,527 --> 00:12:39,094
SO I WILL KILL
EVERY LAST HUMAN

188
00:12:39,127 --> 00:12:43,461
AND EVERY SINGLE COW,
CHICKEN, AND HORSE.

189
00:12:43,494 --> 00:12:45,394
- HMM. DO AS YOU WISH.

190
00:12:45,427 --> 00:12:48,994
I CAN'T BEAR YOUR COMPANY
ANY LONGER.

191
00:12:51,661 --> 00:12:54,394
- [SHUDDERING, CRYING]

192
00:12:55,227 --> 00:12:56,461
- DON'T CRY, YUKI.

193
00:12:56,494 --> 00:13:01,794
THE DEMON WILL NEVER FIND US
IF WE STAY HIDDEN UNDER THE HAY.

194
00:13:05,727 --> 00:13:08,761
- AAH!

195
00:13:08,794 --> 00:13:10,027
HE FOUND US!

196
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:13,827
- YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD
ESCAPE ME BY HIDING
AMONG SOME STRAW,

197
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:15,194
NOW, DIDN'T YOU?

198
00:13:15,227 --> 00:13:16,261
- [BOTH SCREAM]

199
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:19,394
- AND YOU CRIED FOR YOUR MAMA
AND PAPA TO SAVE YOU.

200
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:23,761
THEY CAN'T HELP YOU NOW,
BECAUSE I DEVOURED THEM BOTH.

201
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,161
I SPEAK THE TRUTH.

202
00:13:25,194 --> 00:13:28,227
LOOK INSIDE MY BELLY AND SEE!

203
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:30,794
- [BOTH SCREAMING]

204
00:13:31,927 --> 00:13:35,361
- [SHOUTS]

205
00:13:35,394 --> 00:13:38,027
GET OUT OF HERE.

206
00:13:45,561 --> 00:13:47,361
- LOOK AT THAT.

207
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:48,294
- THE DEMON.

208
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,127
- WITH A SPIDER MARK
ON ITS BACK.

209
00:13:51,161 --> 00:13:54,961
- YOU MUST BE NARAKU'S
THIRD INCARNATION.

210
00:13:54,994 --> 00:13:55,827
- HA HA HA HA!

211
00:13:55,861 --> 00:13:57,661
YOU'RE THINKING
I DODGED THE TETSUSAIGA.

212
00:13:57,694 --> 00:14:02,461
YOU'RE SURPRISED AT MY SPEED
DESPITE MY ENORMOUS SIZE.

213
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:06,127
- HUH? HE KNOWS
WHAT I'M THINKING.

214
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,527
- HA HA HA HA!

215
00:14:07,561 --> 00:14:08,761
JUST AS YOU SUSPECT,

216
00:14:08,794 --> 00:14:11,961
I AM ABLE TO READ
THE MINDS OF OTHERS, INUYASHA.

217
00:14:11,994 --> 00:14:17,794
MY SISTERS KAGURA AND KANNA
WERE MERELY THE OPENING ACTS.

218
00:14:17,827 --> 00:14:21,161
NOW GOSHINKI MAKES HIS DEBUT.

219
00:14:21,194 --> 00:14:24,027
- HUH! YOUR BIG SPEECH
IS OVER, DEMON.

220
00:14:24,061 --> 00:14:27,594
TIME TO TAKE YOU
OFF THE STAGE!

221
00:14:28,394 --> 00:14:30,327
HUH?

222
00:14:34,027 --> 00:14:34,927
- I TOLD YOU,

223
00:14:34,961 --> 00:14:38,561
I KNOW EVERY THOUGHT
THAT CROSSES YOUR MIND.

224
00:14:38,594 --> 00:14:40,994
YOU SEEM TO BE
SUFFERING GREATLY.

225
00:14:41,027 --> 00:14:44,227
TELL ME, COULD THIS BE
THE END OF YOU?

226
00:14:44,261 --> 00:14:45,661
- NOT VERY LIKELY.

227
00:14:45,694 --> 00:14:48,327
I'M GETTING TIRED OF YOU.

228
00:14:48,361 --> 00:14:51,227
- AAH!

229
00:14:51,261 --> 00:14:52,894
WHAT?

230
00:14:52,927 --> 00:14:53,861
AHH!

231
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:58,661
- I CAN PREDICT EVERY MOVE
BEFORE YOU MAKE IT.

232
00:14:58,694 --> 00:15:01,494
- [GRUNTING]

233
00:15:01,527 --> 00:15:02,994
- INUYASHA!

234
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,761
- I'LL GO.

235
00:15:03,794 --> 00:15:05,827
HE'S STILL TOO WEAK
TO FIGHT.

236
00:15:05,861 --> 00:15:07,861
[SHOUTS]
- STOP!

237
00:15:07,894 --> 00:15:11,627
IT'S NARAKU'S POISONOUS INSECTS!

238
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,927
- HA HA HA HA!

239
00:15:12,961 --> 00:15:16,261
YOU WERE THINKING
YOU WOULD SUCK ME INTO
YOUR WIND TUNNEL, MONK.

240
00:15:16,294 --> 00:15:20,961
YOU CAN'T, BECAUSE, YOU SEE,
I KNOW ALL OF YOUR WEAKNESSES.

241
00:15:20,994 --> 00:15:26,094
KAGOME, DON'T EVEN CONSIDER
SHOOTING ME WITH YOUR ARROW.

242
00:15:26,127 --> 00:15:28,861
I'LL KILL YOU
BEFORE YOU DRAW THE BOW.

243
00:15:28,894 --> 00:15:31,227
SANGO, YOU ARE UNABLE
TO BATTLE.

244
00:15:31,261 --> 00:15:36,927
YOU STILL CAN'T MOVE
SINCE YOU WERE STRUCK
WITH YOUR OWN WEAPON.

245
00:15:36,961 --> 00:15:39,227
- ME NEXT?

246
00:15:39,927 --> 00:15:41,494
AW...UH! HEY, YOU!

247
00:15:41,527 --> 00:15:43,894
HOW DARE YOU TRY TO IGNORE ME
LIKE THAT!

248
00:15:43,927 --> 00:15:46,994
- DON'T WORRY, SHIPPO.
HE'S JUST TOYING WITH YOU.

249
00:15:47,027 --> 00:15:48,994
- HUH?

250
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,094
- HUH?

251
00:15:54,127 --> 00:15:55,827
THE CHILDREN FROM THE STABLE.

252
00:15:55,861 --> 00:16:00,061
I TOLD YOU TO ESCAPE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING STILL--

253
00:16:00,094 --> 00:16:03,227
OH. THOSE CLOTHES.

254
00:16:04,227 --> 00:16:06,561
DO THEY BELONG
TO YOUR PARENTS?

255
00:16:06,594 --> 00:16:08,627
- UH-HUH.

256
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:22,127
- JUST BE COOL.
I'LL KILL THIS DEMON
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

257
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:25,861
THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE THINKING,
CORRECT, INUYASHA?

258
00:16:25,894 --> 00:16:28,727
DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

259
00:16:29,427 --> 00:16:32,094
YOU ARE HALF-DEMON,
ARE YOU NOT?

260
00:16:32,127 --> 00:16:35,294
YOU HAVE DEMON BLOOD COURSING
THROUGH YOUR VEINS,

261
00:16:35,327 --> 00:16:37,861
YET YOU TAKE PITY ON HUMANS.

262
00:16:37,894 --> 00:16:39,361
- GET OFF MY BACK!

263
00:16:39,394 --> 00:16:42,627
I'LL SLICE YOU IN HALF!

264
00:16:49,361 --> 00:16:55,227
THE TECHNIQUE THAT BRINGS OUT
THE TETSUSAIGA'S ULTIMATE POWER.

265
00:16:58,127 --> 00:16:59,227
THE WIND SCAR.

266
00:16:59,261 --> 00:17:02,961
- INUYASHA, YOU'RE TRYING TO
SLICE THROUGH THE WIND SCAR

267
00:17:02,994 --> 00:17:05,727
AND BLAST ME AWAY,
ARE YOU NOT?

268
00:17:05,761 --> 00:17:08,094
- IF YOU CAN FIGURE THAT OUT,

269
00:17:08,127 --> 00:17:11,394
YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA DIE.

270
00:17:12,194 --> 00:17:16,261
- THE DEMON HAS DESTROYED
THE WIND SCAR.

271
00:17:16,294 --> 00:17:21,394
- OK, THEN I'LL JUST
SLICE YOUR HEAD IN HALF!

272
00:17:22,961 --> 00:17:24,327
[GASPS]

273
00:17:24,361 --> 00:17:25,127
- YOUR PRECIOUS TETSUSAIGA

274
00:17:25,161 --> 00:17:28,594
IS NOTHING MORE THAN
A DOG FANG NOW.

275
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:32,694
- [GASPS]

276
00:17:32,727 --> 00:17:33,794
- [BOTH GASP]

277
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:37,261
- THE TETSUSAIGA IS BROKEN!

278
00:17:49,075 --> 00:17:54,508
- I SUPPOSE THAT PROVES
A DEMON'S FANGS ARE STRONGER
THAN YOUR TETSUSAIGA.

279
00:17:54,542 --> 00:17:55,975
- HUH!

280
00:17:56,008 --> 00:17:57,742
HE BIT IT IN HALF.

281
00:17:57,775 --> 00:18:01,342
HE DESTROYED MY TETSUSAIGA. HUH?

282
00:18:01,375 --> 00:18:03,942
- [SHOUTING]

283
00:18:03,975 --> 00:18:05,008
- AAH!

284
00:18:05,042 --> 00:18:07,308
- INUYASHA, NO!

285
00:18:15,675 --> 00:18:17,008
- HA HA HA HA!

286
00:18:17,042 --> 00:18:20,908
INUYASHA, IT APPEARS THAT
YOUR MIND HAS NOW GONE BLANK.

287
00:18:20,942 --> 00:18:24,475
YOUR SWORD IS BROKEN,
AND SO IS YOUR SPIRIT.

288
00:18:24,508 --> 00:18:27,675
OR ARE YOU DEAD PERHAPS?

289
00:18:27,708 --> 00:18:28,908
- INUYASHA!

290
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,508
- KAGOME!

291
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:34,308
NO, STAY BACK, KAGOME!

292
00:18:34,342 --> 00:18:36,375
AAH!

293
00:18:36,408 --> 00:18:37,642
UH!

294
00:18:37,675 --> 00:18:39,642
- MIROKU!

295
00:18:39,675 --> 00:18:40,675
- AND YOU, MONK,

296
00:18:40,708 --> 00:18:42,942
YOU WERE PREPARED TO DRAW ME
INTO YOUR WIND TUNNEL,

297
00:18:42,975 --> 00:18:47,475
EVEN IF IT MEANT SACRIFICING
YOUR OWN PATHETIC LIFE.

298
00:18:47,508 --> 00:18:48,842
- MIROKU!

299
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,108
- PLEASE, SAY SOMETHING.

300
00:18:50,142 --> 00:18:51,508
- DON'T RUSH TO YOUR DEATH.

301
00:18:51,542 --> 00:18:57,342
BE ASSURED THAT I PLAN
TO DEVOUR EACH AND EVERY
LAST ONE OF YOU HUMANS.

302
00:18:57,375 --> 00:18:58,108
HA HA HA HA!

303
00:18:58,142 --> 00:19:00,408
AND YOU, KAGOME,
SHALL BE MY FIRST.

304
00:19:00,442 --> 00:19:03,008
- INUYASHA! INUYASHA!

305
00:19:03,042 --> 00:19:03,908
- FOOLISH GIRL.

306
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:07,775
INUYASHA IS ALREADY--
HUH! WHAT'S THIS?

307
00:19:07,808 --> 00:19:10,308
INUYASHA'S HEART.

308
00:19:12,542 --> 00:19:15,642
AAH!

309
00:19:21,942 --> 00:19:24,142
- IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG,
GOSHINKI?

310
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:27,342
I THOUGHT THAT YOU WERE ABLE
TO READ MY MIND.

311
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:30,775
- UH! INUYASHA!

312
00:19:31,242 --> 00:19:35,142
- WHAT'S HAPPENED
TO INUYASHA'S FACE?

313
00:19:35,175 --> 00:19:36,708
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

314
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:40,075
WHY HAVE YOU TRANSFORMED?

315
00:19:40,108 --> 00:19:42,808
- HOW WOULD I KNOW THAT?

316
00:19:42,842 --> 00:19:45,042
YOU SHOULD BE LESS CONCERNED
ABOUT ME

317
00:19:45,075 --> 00:19:47,708
AND MORE CONCERNED
ABOUT JUDGMENT DAY.

318
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:49,775
- WHAT'S THE MEANING OF THIS?

319
00:19:49,808 --> 00:19:52,208
HIS HEART IS
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NOW.

320
00:19:52,242 --> 00:19:56,808
HE HAS NONE OF THE INDECISION
OR SADNESS OR FEAR OF BEFORE.

321
00:19:56,842 --> 00:19:58,008
I SENSE ONLY ANGER,

322
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,875
AND HE DELIGHTS IN THE THOUGHT
OF KILLING ME.

WHAT'S HAPPENED TO INUYASHA?

333
00:20:55,508 --> 00:20:58,408
- I CAN FEEL THE BLOOD RUSHING
THROUGH MY BODY.

334
00:20:58,442 --> 00:21:00,542
WHY DO I FEEL THIS WAY?

335
00:21:00,575 --> 00:21:04,108
I FEEL THE NEED TO KILL MORE.

I CAN'T SAY
WHAT I'M GOING TO DO NEXT.

340
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,742
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

341
00:21:16,775 --> 00:21:19,075
- THE DEMON IN HIM,
IT'S GOTTEN STRONGER.

342
00:21:19,108 --> 00:21:23,308
- YES, HE'S ALMOST LIKE
A FULL-BLOODED DEMON NOW.

00:22:00,142 --> 00:22:02,308
- UH...

361

COME AFTER INUYASHA?

NOW THAT HE'S REVERTED
