NOW HAND OVER THE FRAGMENTS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL TO ME

JUST CAN'T TAKE A JOKE.

493

- UH, THERE MUST BE
SOME MISUNDERSTANDING.

494
00:20:44,083 --> 00:20:44,850
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

495

[WHIMPERS]

I'D HAND OVER THE JEWEL SHARDS

501
00:20:56,650 --> 00:20:58,617
AS A RANSOM
TO GET YOU BACK?

502

'CAUSE THAT'S WHAT
A LOVER WOULD DO!

- BUT WE AIN'T LOVERS!

505
00:21:02,983 --> 00:21:05,450
AND WITHOUT LOVE,
THE WHOLE ARGUMENT
KIND OF FALLS APART.

506
00:21:05,483 --> 00:21:08,717
- SO NOW SOME LITTLE GEMS
ARE MORE IMPORTANT THAN ME?

MY ATTACKS FOR VERY LONG.
