1
00:01:55,003 --> 00:01:56,003
>> THIS IS THE SPOT WHERE

2
00:01:56,003 --> 00:02:00,603
INUYASHA AND I FIRST MET.

3
00:02:00,603 --> 00:02:02,136
OF COURSE, THAT WAS 500 YEARS

4
00:02:02,136 --> 00:02:05,936
AGO DURING THE FEUDAL ERA.

5
00:02:05,936 --> 00:02:10,936
THE TREE.

6
00:02:10,936 --> 00:02:12,936
THAT MEANS I'M PRACTICALLY HOME.

7
00:02:12,936 --> 00:02:16,269
HUH?

8
00:02:16,269 --> 00:02:37,936
IS THAT A BOY?

9
00:02:37,936 --> 00:02:43,103
AND IT ALL BEGAN RIGHT HERE.

10
00:02:43,103 --> 00:02:49,503
[GASPS]

11
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:52,136
>> YOU HAVE IT, DON'T YOU?

12
00:02:52,136 --> 00:02:53,269
THE JEWEL.

13
00:02:53,269 --> 00:02:54,603
GIVE IT TO ME!

14
00:02:54,603 --> 00:02:55,269
>> THAT THING.

15
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:56,436
IT'S AFTER ME.

16
00:02:56,436 --> 00:02:59,269
>> THE SACRED JEWEL!

17
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:00,603
>> WHY ARE YOU TAKING SO LONG

18
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,769
TO KILL IT?

19
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,203
JUST DO HER LIKE YOU DID ME.

20
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:07,636
>> DID HE JUST TALK?

21
00:03:07,636 --> 00:03:09,036
SO YOU'RE ALIVE?

22
00:03:09,036 --> 00:03:09,936
AAH!

23
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:11,536
LET GO OF ME!

24
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:12,703
>> OW, OW, OW!

25
00:03:12,703 --> 00:03:14,436
YOU LET GO!

26
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:16,836
>> LET ME GO!

27
00:03:16,836 --> 00:03:19,103
>> HEY, CAN YOU PULL OUT

28
00:03:19,103 --> 00:03:20,769
THIS ARROW?

29
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:23,369
>> HUH?

30
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:24,036
>> LOOK.

31
00:03:24,036 --> 00:03:25,269
CAN YOU PULL OUT THIS ARROW

32
00:03:25,269 --> 00:03:27,703
OR NOT?

33
00:03:27,703 --> 00:03:29,203
>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD

34
00:03:29,203 --> 00:03:33,203
DO, BUT...

35
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:38,136
GIVEN THE CHOICE, I CHOOSE TO...

36
00:03:38,136 --> 00:03:45,203
HELP!

37
00:03:45,203 --> 00:03:47,703
>> AH, HA HA HA!

38
00:03:47,703 --> 00:03:49,869
>> HUH?

39
00:03:49,869 --> 00:03:52,036
>> WICKED CHILD.

40
00:03:52,036 --> 00:03:54,703
>> NASTY HAG.

41
00:03:54,703 --> 00:04:02,469
IRON REAVER SOUL STEALER!

42
00:04:02,469 --> 00:04:12,803
HAH.

43
00:04:12,803 --> 00:04:13,836
>> IF I HADN'T BEEN ATTACKED

44
00:04:13,836 --> 00:04:16,269
BY THAT CENTIPEDE DEMON,

45
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:17,369
IF I HADN'T MET INUYASHA

46
00:04:17,369 --> 00:04:19,836
THAT DAY, I WOULDN'T HAVE TO

47
00:04:19,836 --> 00:04:21,636
STRESS OUT DURING TESTS,

48
00:04:21,636 --> 00:04:22,636
AND GRANDPA WOULDN'T HAVE TO

49
00:04:22,636 --> 00:04:23,969
AGONIZE OVER MY PRETEND

50
00:04:23,969 --> 00:04:28,803
ILLNESSES.

51
00:04:28,803 --> 00:04:29,803
>> HEY, SIS.

52
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:30,969
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

53
00:04:30,969 --> 00:04:31,636
>> YEAH, I GOTTA GO

54
00:04:31,636 --> 00:04:32,636
DO SOMETHING.

55
00:04:32,636 --> 00:04:33,969
>> MAN, WHEN DID SHE BECOME

56
00:04:33,969 --> 00:04:36,136
A MORNING PERSON?

57
00:04:36,136 --> 00:04:36,969
>> MORNING, MOM.

58
00:04:36,969 --> 00:04:38,303
IS MY LUNCH READY?

59
00:04:38,303 --> 00:04:39,136
>> YES.

60
00:04:39,136 --> 00:04:39,803
AND I MADE ENOUGH FOR YOUR

61
00:04:39,803 --> 00:04:41,069
FRIENDS, TOO.

62
00:04:41,069 --> 00:04:42,136
>> WOW, THANKS!

63
00:04:42,136 --> 00:04:43,469
>> NO PROBLEM.

64
00:04:43,469 --> 00:04:45,069
THERE'S ONE THING, KAGOME.

65
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:45,969
>> HUH?

66
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,136
>> DO ME A FAVOR AND ASK HOW

67
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,103
EVERYONE LIKES IT, OK, DEAR?

68
00:04:49,103 --> 00:04:51,769
>> UH, SURE.

69
00:04:51,769 --> 00:04:52,969
JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS LIKE ME

70
00:04:52,969 --> 00:04:54,236
HAVE IT TOUGH ENOUGH WITH JUST

71
00:04:54,236 --> 00:04:57,136
OUR STUDIES TO WORRY ABOUT.

72
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:57,969
>> KAGOME.

73
00:04:57,969 --> 00:04:59,303
>> HMM?

74
00:04:59,303 --> 00:05:01,469
HEY, GOOD MORNING!

75
00:05:01,469 --> 00:05:02,236
>> YEAH.

76
00:05:02,236 --> 00:05:03,736
LET'S GET MOVING, OK?

77
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:06,236
>> OK.

78
00:05:06,236 --> 00:05:07,736
ONCE AGAIN I'M SETTING OUT INTO

79
00:05:07,736 --> 00:05:23,736
THE FEUDAL ERA.

80
00:05:23,736 --> 00:05:26,736
AND ONCE AGAIN...

81
00:05:26,736 --> 00:05:31,469
>> KAGOME, WELCOME BACK!

82
00:05:31,469 --> 00:05:33,236
>> HI, GUYS.

83
00:05:33,236 --> 00:05:34,236
>> HEY, INUYASHA,

84
00:05:34,236 --> 00:05:36,403
LIGHT A FIRE UNDER IT.

85
00:05:36,403 --> 00:05:37,569
>> ONCE AGAIN I'LL CONTINUE

86
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:39,487
THE JOURNEY AND DO MY BEST

87
00:05:39,487 --> 00:05:58,563
TO FIND THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

88
00:05:58,563 --> 00:05:59,563
>> HEY, INUYASHA,

89
00:05:59,563 --> 00:06:00,730
HAVE YOU NOTICED THEM?

90
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:05,996
>> OH, YEAH.

91
00:06:05,996 --> 00:06:06,663
>> WE'RE BEING WATCHED

92
00:06:06,663 --> 00:06:08,263
BY SAIMYOSHO.

93
00:06:08,263 --> 00:06:09,163
>> HA!

94
00:06:09,163 --> 00:06:10,330
NARAKU'S STUPID BUGS ARE

95
00:06:10,330 --> 00:06:11,596
PROBABLY JUST MAKING SURE THAT

96
00:06:11,596 --> 00:06:12,496
WE'RE HEADING TOWARD

97
00:06:12,496 --> 00:06:17,830
THE REALM OF FIRE.

98
00:06:17,830 --> 00:06:18,596
COME ON, MYOGA.

99
00:06:18,596 --> 00:06:19,630
THINK HARD.

100
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:20,530
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T KNOW

101
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:21,530
OF ANY OTHER WAY TO GET

102
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:22,596
TO THE GRAVEYARD?

103
00:06:22,596 --> 00:06:23,996
>> OH, FOR THE LAST TIME,

104
00:06:23,996 --> 00:06:25,163
THERE IS NO OTHER WAY TO REACH

105
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:26,996
THE GRAVEYARD, OK!

106
00:06:26,996 --> 00:06:30,230
>> SO, INUYASHA...

107
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
YOU WOULD LIKE TO KNOW

108
00:06:31,063 --> 00:06:35,063
WHERE THE PATHWAY IS?

109
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,163
>> HMM, KAGURA.

110
00:06:37,163 --> 00:06:38,796
>> HAKUDOSHI IS HEADED TOWARD

111
00:06:38,796 --> 00:06:39,863
THE MOUNTAIN IN THE REALM

112
00:06:39,863 --> 00:06:41,063
OF FIRE.

113
00:06:41,063 --> 00:06:42,230
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE A GATEWAY

114
00:06:42,230 --> 00:06:43,496
THERE THAT LEADS THE TRAVELER

115
00:06:43,496 --> 00:06:45,130
TO THE BORDER BETWEEN THIS WORLD

116
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:46,363
AND THE NEXT.

117
00:06:46,363 --> 00:06:47,030
>> MOUNTAIN IN THE REALM

118
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,530
OF FIRE?

119
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,630
>> I DON'T UNDERSTAND, KAGURA.

120
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:51,530
WHY HAVE YOU COME TO TELL US

121
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,363
THIS?

122
00:06:52,363 --> 00:06:53,663
>> I DON'T KNOW.

123
00:06:53,663 --> 00:06:55,263
YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HAKUDOSHI

124
00:06:55,263 --> 00:07:03,330
THAT.

125
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,863
>> ACTUALLY, INUYASHA,

126
00:07:04,863 --> 00:07:06,063
I DON'T THINK THEY WERE SENT

127
00:07:06,063 --> 00:07:07,163
TO WATCH US.

128
00:07:07,163 --> 00:07:08,763
I THINK THE SAIMYOSHO WERE SENT

129
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:11,096
TO LEAD US TO THE GATE.

130
00:07:11,096 --> 00:07:12,963
>> YES, I AGREE.

131
00:07:12,963 --> 00:07:14,096
BUT IF THEY WERE, IN FACT,

132
00:07:14,096 --> 00:07:15,996
SENT TO SHOW US THE WAY,

133
00:07:15,996 --> 00:07:18,430
PERHAPS IT MEANS THAT HAKUDOSHI

134
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,596
DOESN'T HAVE THE POWER TO PASS

135
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,930
THROUGH THE GATE ALONE.

136
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:21,763
>> IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

137
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:23,063
THE NARAKU WE KNOW, I'M SURE

138
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,230
HE HAS SOMETHING UP HIS SLEEVE.

139
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,930
>> YEAH, BUT THIS IS HAKUDOSHI,

140
00:07:26,930 --> 00:07:28,996
NOT NARAKU, REMEMBER?

141
00:07:28,996 --> 00:07:30,063
>> DON'T FORGET HAKUDOSHI

142
00:07:30,063 --> 00:07:32,096
IS AN INCARNATION OF NARAKU.

143
00:07:32,096 --> 00:07:33,930
>> HAH, LISTEN TO YOU TWO.

144
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:35,730
WHO CARES WHICH ONE IT IS?

145
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:37,063
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS GET TO

146
00:07:37,063 --> 00:07:37,996
THE GRAVEYARD AT THE BORDER

147
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:39,596
OF THE NETHERWORLD FIRST AND GET

148
00:07:39,596 --> 00:07:40,863
HOLD OF THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD

149
00:07:40,863 --> 00:07:42,096
BEFORE THE BAD GUY.

150
00:07:42,096 --> 00:07:43,430
SIMPLE.

151
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,430
>> SPEAKING OF SIMPLE--

152
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:46,430
>> HEY, COME ON.

153
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,430
INUYASHA CAN'T HELP HIS

154
00:07:47,430 --> 00:07:50,430
LIMITATIONS, SHIPPO.

155
00:07:50,430 --> 00:07:58,630
>> INUYASHA.

156
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,263
>> SO THIS IS THE REALM OF FIRE?

157
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:01,963
>> YES.

158
00:08:01,963 --> 00:08:02,796
AND IT CERTAINLY LIVES UP TO

159
00:08:02,796 --> 00:08:09,030
ITS NAME, DOESN'T IT?

160
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,263
>> NOW WHAT?

161
00:08:10,263 --> 00:08:14,263
>> WE WAIT AND SEE.

162
00:08:14,263 --> 00:08:15,363
AFTER THEM.

163
00:08:15,363 --> 00:08:29,363
>> HACHI, GO DOWN.

164
00:08:29,363 --> 00:08:31,130
IT WENT DOWN THERE.

165
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:33,530
>> LOOKS KIND OF CREEPY.

166
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:34,630
>> UH-HUH.

167
00:08:34,630 --> 00:08:35,530
>> GOOD.

168
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,530
IT SHOULD DO IF IT'S

169
00:08:36,530 --> 00:08:38,696
THE ENTRANCE TO A GRAVEYARD.

170
00:08:38,696 --> 00:08:40,696
LET'S GET GOING.

171
00:08:40,696 --> 00:08:43,030
>> MIROKU?

172
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:56,030
>> HMM, INUYASHA'S RIGHT.

173
00:08:56,030 --> 00:08:58,196
>> KAGURA, APPARENTLY INUYASHA
