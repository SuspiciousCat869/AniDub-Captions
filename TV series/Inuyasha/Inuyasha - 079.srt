AND CONTROLLED
THE PLAINS OF MUSASHI.

HUNDRED YEARS OLD,

WAS A FORMIDABLE FOE.

DESTROYED OR STOLEN.

THE COMBINED SADNESS
AND BITTERNESS

238

SAY WE LET HIM GO

IF HE RETURNS
OUR BELONGINGS?

YOU SURE YOU WEREN'T
JUST IMAGINING IT?

272

SO LET'S KEEP
MOVING AHEAD.

277
00:12:21,034 --> 00:12:23,001
- THAT MUST HURT, MASTER JAKEN.

278

GIVING UP THEN.

00:12:26,401 --> 00:12:27,067
- NEVER!

281
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,967
NOW, WOULD YOU
STOP INTERFERING

282
00:12:28,001 --> 00:12:30,234
AND QUESTIONING
MY EVERY MOVE?

283
00:12:30,267 --> 00:12:31,067
NOW, BE OFF!

284
00:12:31,101 --> 00:12:32,867
- BUT I THOUGHT YOU
SAID YOU WANTED ME

285
00:12:32,901 --> 00:12:34,001
TO SEE YOU IN ACTION.

286
00:12:34,034 --> 00:12:36,534
- I SAID NO SUCH THING!

287
00:12:36,567 --> 00:12:38,634
JUST YOU WAIT,
INUYASHA.

288
00:12:38,667 --> 00:12:41,601
I WILL TAKE THE TETSUSAIGA
AWAY FROM YOU,

289
00:12:41,634 --> 00:12:43,534
JUST YOU WAIT AND SEE!

290
00:12:43,567 --> 00:12:47,301
- WELL, THAT TOOK A BIG
BITE OUT OF THE DAY.

291
00:12:47,334 --> 00:12:50,667
- GREETINGS,

292
00:12:50,701 --> 00:12:52,101
- HMM?

293
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:53,267

294
00:12:53,301 --> 00:12:57,867
"IN TRAINING, OFFERING FREE
ADVICE AND WEAPON SHARPENING."

295

- I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT YOU GUYS,

296
00:12:58,967 --> 00:13:01,201
BUT I DON'T LIKE
THE LOOKS OF THIS OLD GUY.

297
00:13:01,234 --> 00:13:02,767
- KEEP IT COMING,
SONNY.

298
00:13:02,801 --> 00:13:05,601
YOU'RE BUILDING
MY CHARACTER.

299
00:13:05,634 --> 00:13:06,634
HEH HEH HEH!

300
00:13:06,667 --> 00:13:09,567
THIS INCENSE HAS DULLED
INUYASHA'S SENSE OF SMELL,

301
00:13:09,601 --> 00:13:12,334
AND HE HAS
NO IDEA WHO I AM.

302
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:13,334
WHAT WILL IT BE?

303
00:13:13,367 --> 00:13:16,267
CAN I SHARPEN YOUR
LIVES OR YOUR KNIVES?

304
00:13:16,301 --> 00:13:17,434
- SHARPEN A LIFE?

305
00:13:17,467 --> 00:13:20,334
- SO, WHY DON'T YOU
LET HIM WORK ON YOUR
SWORD, INUYASHA?

306
00:13:20,367 --> 00:13:21,367
- ON MY SWORD?

307
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,534
- YES, SON.

308
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:25,167
I'D BE HONORED.

309
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:26,101
- HUH.

310
00:13:26,134 --> 00:13:27,767
HOW UNUSUAL TO FIND
A SWORD-SHARPENING MONK.

311
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:30,967
- HE MUST BE A CRAFTSMAN
OF THE FEUDAL ERA.

312
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:33,234
MAYBE I'LL GIVE IT A GO.

313
00:13:33,267 --> 00:13:35,267
NO CHARGE, RIGHT?

314
00:13:35,301 --> 00:13:36,001
- HUH?

315
00:13:36,034 --> 00:13:37,634
- HOW GENEROUS OF YOU.

316
00:13:37,667 --> 00:13:39,534
- DO A GOOD JOB.

317
00:13:39,567 --> 00:13:40,701
- DON'T FORGET THIS.

318
00:13:40,734 --> 00:13:41,601
- JUST A MOMENT.

319
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:42,701
- THAT'S ABOUT ALL THAT
NEEDS SHARPENING.

320
00:13:42,734 --> 00:13:44,667
WE'LL STOP BY LATER
AND PICK THEM UP.

321
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:47,934
- DO A GOOD JOB, OLD MAN.

322
00:13:47,967 --> 00:13:49,567
- DAMN THAT INUYASHA!

323
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,434
ALL RIGHT!

324
00:13:50,467 --> 00:13:51,367
I'LL SHARPEN THEM!

325
00:13:51,401 --> 00:13:53,634
SO, IF I CAN DO A GOOD
JOB ON THESE WEAPONS,

326
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:56,667
