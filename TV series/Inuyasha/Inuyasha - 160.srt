00:17:33,473 --> 00:17:34,773
>> UGH!

515
00:17:34,773 --> 00:17:36,540
>> SO, BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL.

516
00:17:36,540 --> 00:17:39,706
>> INUYASHA, SIT!

517
00:17:39,706 --> 00:17:41,773
>> AAH!

518
00:17:41,773 --> 00:17:42,906
THE JAR!

519
00:17:42,906 --> 00:17:44,640
>> IT WASN'T MY FAULT!

520
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:47,540
>> [THINKING] HE'S IN THE SHED.

521
00:17:47,540 --> 00:17:48,506
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

522
00:17:48,506 --> 00:17:49,306
>> KAGOME?

523
00:17:49,306 --> 00:17:52,873
>> [SOBBING]

524
00:17:52,873 --> 00:17:55,206
>> GRANDPA, WHERE'S INUYASHA AT?

525
00:17:55,206 --> 00:17:58,573
>> HE RAN AWAY.

526
00:17:58,573 --> 00:17:59,440
>> UNBELIEVABLE.

527
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,506
HE BREAKS EVERYTHING HE LAYS HIS

528
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,207
HANDS ON.

529
00:18:13,522 --> 00:18:15,122
>> I THINK HE ALREADY LEFT.

530
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:17,088
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

531
00:18:17,088 --> 00:18:18,488
THAT'S TOO BAD.

532
00:18:18,488 --> 00:18:19,422
>> AND WE WERE DYING TO MEET THE

533
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:20,722
GUY, YOU KNOW?

534
00:18:20,722 --> 00:18:21,955
>> HE COMES AROUND PRETTY OFTEN,

535
00:18:21,955 --> 00:18:23,055
THOUGH, DOESN'T HE?

536
00:18:23,055 --> 00:18:25,788
>> UH, WELL, NOT EXACTLY.

537
00:18:25,788 --> 00:18:27,488
[THINKING] OH, GOOD.

538
00:18:27,488 --> 00:18:29,455
IT ALL WORKED OUT, SORTA.

539
00:18:29,455 --> 00:18:30,755
HE'S SUCH A WEIRDO.

540
00:18:30,755 --> 00:18:32,055
>> KAGOME?

541
00:18:32,055 --> 00:18:32,788
>> HUH?

542
00:18:32,788 --> 00:18:33,788
>> COME GET SOME TEA.

543
00:18:33,788 --> 00:18:35,455
>> ALL RIGHT.

544
00:18:35,455 --> 00:18:45,622
UH, I WON'T BE LONG, YOU GUYS.

545
00:18:45,622 --> 00:18:46,455
>> OH.

546
00:18:46,455 --> 00:18:47,155
>> TOO BAD.

547
00:18:47,155 --> 00:18:48,488
I REALLY WANTED TO SEE HIM.

548
00:18:48,488 --> 00:18:49,788
>> YOU CAN SAY THAT AGAIN.

549
00:18:49,788 --> 00:18:51,388
WE CAME ALL THE WAY HERE, TOO.

550
00:18:51,388 --> 00:18:53,455
>> WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, KAGOME?

551
00:18:53,455 --> 00:18:54,755
YOU'VE BEEN UPSET SINCE THIS

552
00:18:54,755 --> 00:18:56,922
MORN--

553

>> [GASP] YOU WOULDN'T BE--

554
00:18:59,522 --> 00:19:00,955
>> HE'S GOTTA BE.

555
00:19:00,955 --> 00:19:04,222
>> HE'S DEFINITELY!

556
00:19:04,222 --> 00:19:07,355
>> HMM.

557
00:19:07,355 --> 00:19:09,222
WHO ARE YOU GIRLS?

558
00:19:09,222 --> 00:19:10,488
>> YES!

559
00:19:10,488 --> 00:19:11,688
HE'S THE NUTCASE WHO WENT CRAZY

560
00:19:11,688 --> 00:19:13,455
AT THE SCHOOL RECITAL!

561
00:19:13,455 --> 00:19:15,722
>> THE ONE WHO HAD A RUN-IN WITH

HOJO DURING THE CULTURAL

563
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,255
FESTIVAL.

564
00:19:18,255 --> 00:19:19,455
>> THAT GUY WAS KAGOME'S

565
00:19:19,455 --> 00:19:20,755
BOYFRIEND?

566
00:19:20,755 --> 00:19:23,788
>> [SIGH] SORRY TO KEEP YOU.

567
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,888
>> DID KAGOME ASK YOU TO DO THAT

568
00:19:24,888 --> 00:19:26,388
BACK THEN?

569
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:27,988
>> UH-HUH, YEAH.

570
00:19:27,988 --> 00:19:29,022
MORE OR LESS.

571
00:19:29,022 --> 00:19:29,855
>> [THINKING] I DON'T BELIEVE

THIS!

573
00:19:30,722 --> 00:19:33,722
WHY IS INUYASHA TALKING TO THEM?

574
00:19:33,722 --> 00:19:35,122
AAH!

575
00:19:35,122 --> 00:19:35,888
[THINKING] THEY'RE GOING TO FIND

576
00:19:35,888 --> 00:19:37,722
OUT THAT HE'S A HALF DEMON!

577
00:19:37,722 --> 00:19:38,555
>> SO, TELL US.

578
00:19:38,555 --> 00:19:39,488
WHEN DID YOU START SEEING

579
00:19:39,488 --> 00:19:40,288
KAGOME?

580
00:19:40,288 --> 00:19:41,322
>> IT'S BEEN A WHILE NOW, I

581
00:19:41,322 --> 00:19:42,155
GUESS.

582
00:19:42,155 --> 00:19:43,222
>> WHAT'S WITH THE CRAZY DUDS?

583
00:19:43,222 --> 00:19:44,122
ARE YOU WORKING AT THE SHRINE OR

584
00:19:44,122 --> 00:19:44,788
SOMETHING?

585
00:19:44,788 --> 00:19:46,222
>> YOUR EYES SURE ARE AN UNUSUAL

586
00:19:46,222 --> 00:19:47,055
COLOR.

587
00:19:47,055 --> 00:19:48,222
>> DO YOU BLEACH YOUR HAIR WHITE

588
00:19:48,222 --> 00:19:49,155
OR WHAT?

589
00:19:49,155 --> 00:19:50,022
>> IT'S THE COLOR I WAS BORN

590
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,055
WITH.

591
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:53,888
>> [GASP] WOW, THAT'S DIFFERENT.

592
00:19:53,888 --> 00:19:54,922
>> YOU THINK SO?

593
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,288
>> CAN I TOUCH IT?

594
00:19:56,288 --> 00:19:58,855
>> YEAH, I GUESS SO.

595
00:19:58,855 --> 00:19:59,722

596
00:19:59,722 --> 00:20:01,422
ON A CONVERSATION?

597
00:20:01,422 --> 00:20:03,622
>> HEY, HE'S GOTTA BE BIRACIAL

598
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:04,388
OR SOMETHING.

599
00:20:04,388 --> 00:20:06,055
>> BI WHAT?

600
00:20:06,055 --> 00:20:07,888
>> WELL, KAGOME, IS HE?

601
00:20:07,888 --> 00:20:09,222
>> WELL...

602
00:20:09,222 --> 00:20:11,722
YOU COULD CALL IT THAT.

603
00:20:11,722 --> 00:20:13,522
[THINKING] HE IS A HALF DEMON.

604
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:16,155
>> OH, HE'S SWEET!

605
00:20:16,155 --> 00:20:19,122
>> AWESOME.

606
00:20:19,122 --> 00:20:21,188
>> I'M JEALOUS, KAGOME.

607
00:20:21,188 --> 00:20:22,888
>> SO COOL.

608
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,522
>> SO, YOU'VE LIVED OVERSEAS,

609
00:20:25,522 --> 00:20:26,255
HAVE YOU?

610
00:20:26,255 --> 00:20:27,255
>> TELL ME, WHEN DID YOU COME TO

611
00:20:27,255 --> 00:20:32,255
JAPAN?

612
00:20:32,255 --> 00:20:37,755
>> SEE YOU, KAGOME!

613
00:20:37,755 --> 00:20:40,288
>> I'LL BE SEEING YOU.

614
00:20:40,288 --> 00:20:41,855
>> KAGOME, HE'S NOT AS BAD AS

615
00:20:41,855 --> 00:20:43,155
YOU MADE HIM OUT TO BE.

616
00:20:43,155 --> 00:20:44,955
>> YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

617
00:20:44,955 --> 00:20:46,155
I THOUGHT HE LOOKED LIKE A GUY

618
00:20:46,155 --> 00:20:47,855
IN A STREET GANG OR SOMETHING.

619
00:20:47,855 --> 00:20:50,555
>> WELL, HE IS A BIT DIFFERENT,

620
00:20:50,555 --> 00:20:51,688
THOUGH.

621
00:20:51,688 --> 00:20:53,288
>> YOU KNOW, HE'S NOT ALL LIKE I

622
00:20:53,288 --> 00:20:55,155
PICTURED HE'D BE.

623
00:20:55,155 --> 00:20:56,155
>> SEE YA.

624
00:20:56,155 --> 00:20:58,122
>> YOU TWO GET ALONG.

625
00:20:58,122 --> 00:20:59,322
>> NOW, THE REAL PROBLEM IS

626
00:20:59,322 --> 00:21:00,122
HOJO.

627
00:21:00,122 --> 00:21:01,722
>> YEAH, HE DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT

628
00:21:01,722 --> 00:21:03,422
THE BAD BOY.

629
00:21:03,422 --> 00:21:04,255
>> [THINKING] DOES THAT MEAN

630
00:21:04,255 --> 00:21:05,922
THEY LIKE INUYASHA?

631
00:21:05,922 --> 00:21:08,455
OH...

632
00:21:08,455 --> 00:21:09,422
ALL RIGHT!

633
00:21:09,422 --> 00:21:18,155
THEY THINK HE'S COOL.

00:21:19,288 --> 00:21:21,355
UH, KAGOME, WE GOTTA TALK.

636
00:21:21,355 --> 00:21:23,022
YOU DON'T NEED THAT THING, I

637
00:21:23,022 --> 00:21:24,455
HOPE.

638
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:28,455
>> UH, WHAT THING IS THAT?

639
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,888
>> YOU KNOW!

640
00:21:29,888 --> 00:21:30,988
THAT IRON CART YOU USE

641
00:21:30,988 --> 00:21:32,222
SOMETIMES.

642
00:21:32,222 --> 00:21:33,422
