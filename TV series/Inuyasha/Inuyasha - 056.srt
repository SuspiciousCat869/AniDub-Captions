1
00:01:44,428 --> 00:01:47,562
- I'M KAGOME HIGURASHI,
A NINTH-GRADER.

2
00:01:47,595 --> 00:01:51,428
MY FAMILY AND I ARE CARETAKERS
OF A VERY OLD HISTORIC SHRINE,

3
00:01:51,462 --> 00:01:54,695
AND UP UNTIL RECENTLY,
I LED A PRETTY NORMAL LIFE.

4
00:01:54,728 --> 00:01:57,962
BUT ON MY 15th BIRTHDAY, I WAS
DRAGGED INTO THE FEUDAL ERA

5
00:01:57,995 --> 00:02:02,662
BY A DEMON WHO SUDDENLY EMERGED
FROM THE OLD SHRINE WELL.

6
00:02:02,695 --> 00:02:05,862
THERE, COUNTLESS DEMONS WISHING
TO INCREASE THEIR POWER

7
00:02:05,895 --> 00:02:09,028
SEARCHED FOR THE SACRED
SHIKON JEWEL.

8
00:02:09,628 --> 00:02:13,262
THIS IS WHERE I MET
A HALF-DEMON NAMED INUYASHA.

9
00:02:13,295 --> 00:02:19,228
INUYASHA WANTS THE SACRED JEWEL
TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

10
00:02:23,528 --> 00:02:25,995
SINCE WE MET,
WE'VE TRAVELED TOGETHER

11
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:27,295
IN SEARCH OF SACRED JEWEL SHARDS

12
00:02:27,328 --> 00:02:30,595
THAT ARE SCATTERED
THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY.

13
00:02:30,628 --> 00:02:33,228
WE'VE FOUGHT MANY DEMONS
ON OUR JOURNEY,

14
00:02:33,262 --> 00:02:36,695
BUT WE'VE ALSO MADE FRIENDS
ALONG THE WAY...

15
00:02:37,495 --> 00:02:40,428
LIKE SHIPPO, A VERY
CUTE FOX DEMON CHILD.

16
00:02:40,462 --> 00:02:46,195
HE ALWAYS TRIES SO HARD, AND HE
HELPS US WITH HIS FOX MAGIC.

17
00:02:46,795 --> 00:02:47,895
AND THE MONK, MIROKU.

18
00:02:47,928 --> 00:02:50,995
THE WIND TUNNEL ON HIS PALM,
INFLICTED BY NARAKU'S CURSE,

19
00:02:51,028 --> 00:02:53,995

ANYTHING IN ITS PATH.

20
00:02:54,028 --> 00:02:58,862
HE'S FAIRLY DEPENDABLE,
AT LEAST MOST OF THE TIME.

21
00:03:00,928 --> 00:03:04,962
SANGO IS THE LAST SURVIVOR
OF A TRIBE OF DEMON SLAYERS.

22
00:03:04,995 --> 00:03:10,362
HER MISSION IS TO DESTROY NARAKU
TO AVENGE HER PEOPLE.

23
00:03:12,562 --> 00:03:15,928
NARAKU IS THE MOST
DESPICABLE DEMON OF ALL.

24
00:03:15,962 --> 00:03:18,628
HE RESORTS TO DIRTY TRICKS
AND DEVIOUS TRAPS

25
00:03:18,662 --> 00:03:22,762
TO BRING DOWN HIS ENEMIES
WITHOUT NEEDING TO SULLY
HIS OWN HANDS.

26
00:03:22,795 --> 00:03:25,595
HE IS STEADILY ACCUMULATING
SHARDS OF THE JEWEL,

27
00:03:25,628 --> 00:03:28,228
GROWING MORE AND MORE
POWERFUL ALL THE WHILE.

28
00:03:28,262 --> 00:03:32,895
WE'LL POOL OUR STRENGTH AND
SOMEDAY FIND NARAKU'S CASTLE.

29
00:03:32,928 --> 00:03:35,162
TOGETHER, WE'LL BRING HIM DOWN.

HUH?

318
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:10,956
- PLEASE FORGIVE ME FOR BEING
SO ROUGH, PRINCESS.

319
00:18:10,989 --> 00:18:14,422
- YOU SAVED ME.

320
00:18:14,456 --> 00:18:17,056
- YOU WERE ISOLATED FOR SO LONG.

321
00:18:17,089 --> 00:18:19,689
IT MUST HAVE BEEN VERY LONELY.

322
00:18:19,722 --> 00:18:20,456
- YES.

323
00:18:20,489 --> 00:18:22,456
I WAS SO WEAK-HEARTED
AND COWARDLY

324
00:18:22,489 --> 00:18:25,556
THAT I FELL VICTIM
TO AN AWFUL DEMON.

325
00:18:25,589 --> 00:18:27,256
- IT'S ALL OVER NOW.

326
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:30,956
I'LL TAKE YOU TO THE VILLAGE.

327
00:18:30,989 --> 00:18:33,656
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.

328
00:18:46,789 --> 00:18:49,489
- SHE DISAPPEARED.

329
00:18:49,522 --> 00:18:50,522
- YES.

330
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:51,989
THAT WAS HER SOUL.

331
00:18:52,022 --> 00:18:53,722
SHE DIED A LONELY DEATH.

332
00:18:53,756 --> 00:18:54,922
IT WASN'T BITTERNESS.

333
00:18:54,956 --> 00:18:59,689
IT WAS LONELINESS THAT KEPT HER
FROM FINDING PEACE IN DEATH.

334
00:19:00,889 --> 00:19:04,389
THE DEMON COYOTE STOLE
THE PRINCESS' BODY AND SOUL,

335
00:19:04,422 --> 00:19:06,356
THEN IMPERSONATED HER
TO LURE MEN IN,

336
00:19:06,389 --> 00:19:10,922
BUT THEN SUCKED OUT
THEIR YOUTH TO GAIN POWER.

337
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:19,056
I HAVE BURIED THE PRINCESS'
ASHES HERE IN THIS HUMBLE GRAVE.

338
00:19:19,089 --> 00:19:21,122
IF YOU ALL OFFER UP
YOUR PRAYERS,

339
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:23,989
I AM SURE THAT SHE WILL
WATCH OVER THE VILLAGE.

340
00:19:24,022 --> 00:19:25,656
- WE THANK YOU VERY MUCH, MONK.

341
00:19:25,689 --> 00:19:28,789
WE'RE SO GRATEFUL YOU
BROUGHT OUR MEN BACK TO US.

342
00:19:28,822 --> 00:19:32,322
- IT SEEMS NO MORE
THAN A PLEASANT DREAM NOW.

343
00:19:32,356 --> 00:19:33,889
- I'LL SAY.

344
00:19:33,922 --> 00:19:36,422
- HEY, CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

345
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:37,256
- YES.

346
00:19:37,289 --> 00:19:38,622
- DID ANYTHING HAPPEN
ON THE MOUNTAIN?

347
00:19:38,656 --> 00:19:42,622
SANGO SEEMS AWFULLY DEPRESSED
SINCE YOU TWO GOT BACK.

348
00:19:42,656 --> 00:19:43,556
- UH, NO.

MIGHT BE BOTHERING HER.

352
00:19:52,122 --> 00:19:54,189
HOW COULD I BE SO FOOLISH?

353
00:19:55,656 --> 00:19:57,056
- SANGO?

00:19:57,089 --> 00:19:58,656
- HUH?

- WHAT'S WRONG?

356
00:20:02,056 --> 00:20:02,956
- I'M SORRY.

00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,322
I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER FOLLOWED YOU

358

INTO THE MOUNTAINS
LIKE THAT, MIROKU.

- NOW, DON'T BE FOOLISH.

360
00:20:08,122 --> 00:20:11,122
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO DESTROYED
THE DEMON, AREN'T YOU?

361
00:20:11,156 --> 00:20:13,456
- THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
YOU HELPED ME.

362
00:20:13,489 --> 00:20:16,256
- NO, NO.
I RELIED ON YOUR HELP,

363
00:20:16,289 --> 00:20:20,022
BECAUSE I HAD TRUST
IN YOUR STRENGTH, SANGO.

364
00:20:20,056 --> 00:20:20,689
- HUH?

365
00:20:20,722 --> 00:20:23,022
- YOU'RE IMAGINING THINGS.

366
00:20:23,056 --> 00:20:26,656
SANGO WOULDN'T FALL IN LOVE
WITH THAT PERVERT.

- OK.
I'M READY FOR AN EXPLANATION.

369
00:20:31,189 --> 00:20:33,756
- SANGO, YOU CAME WITH ME,

370
00:20:33,789 --> 00:20:36,189
BECAUSE YOU WERE CONCERNED
ABOUT MY SAFETY.

371
00:20:36,222 --> 00:20:37,256
IS THAT CORRECT?

372
00:20:37,289 --> 00:20:39,589
- WELL, SURE THAT'S WHY I CAME.

373
00:20:39,622 --> 00:20:42,389
YES, OF COURSE I WAS
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

374
00:20:42,422 --> 00:20:44,356
YOU'RE NOT EXACTLY REASONABLE

375
00:20:44,389 --> 00:20:46,189
WHEN YOU'RE AROUND WOMEN,
YOU KNOW.

376
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:49,856
I WAS ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN
YOU'D GET INTO TROUBLE.

377
00:20:49,889 --> 00:20:51,556
- I OWE YOU AN APOLOGY.

378
00:20:51,589 --> 00:20:53,389
I HAD TO GO INTO
THE DEMON'S LAIR,

379
00:20:53,422 --> 00:20:57,422
BECAUSE I COULDN'T IGNORE
A WOMAN WHO MIGHT BE GRIEVING.

00:20:57,456 --> 00:20:58,489
- HMM?

381
00:20:58,522 --> 00:21:02,922
IT'S NOT AS THOUGH I'M JEALOUS
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

HUH?

THAN THAT OF ANY OTHER WOMAN.

ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?

OH, NO.
WHAT'LL I DO?

389

HMM.

WELL, DIDN'T I?
