- THE TETSUSAIGA SUPPRESSES THE

A DART RIGHT NOW.

- DURING A PREVIOUS BATTLE,

00:02:24,429 --> 00:02:25,896
THE TETSUSAIGA WAS BROKEN,

11
00:02:25,929 --> 00:02:29,696
AWAKENING INUYASHA'S
DEMON BLOOD.

ONCE IT'S INITIALLY ROUSED,

00:02:34,463 --> 00:02:36,829

OTHERWISE, WHEN HIS LIFE

HIS DEMONIC NATURE
WILL TAKE OVER.

COULD IT BE THAT HE'S

JUST OFF TRAINING SOMEWHERE?

34
00:03:51,796 --> 00:03:52,529
- THINK SO?

35
00:03:52,563 --> 00:03:54,829
SOUNDS LIKE
WAY TOO MUCH HARD WORK

FOR THE INUYASHA

BUT INUYASHA IS
REALLY TORMENTED.

43
00:04:09,996 --> 00:04:12,296
IT'D BE BETTER TO LEAVE HIM
ALONE FOR A WHILE

TO SORT THINGS OUT ON HIS OWN.

IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE
YOU STILL HAVE TROUBLE
