00:10:14,628 --> 00:10:20,228
- WE'LL ALL MEET UP
LATER AT THE ENTRANCE
TO THE VALLEY, SHALL WE?

159
00:10:29,362 --> 00:10:31,795
- HERE, KAGOME. YOU OK?

160
00:10:32,462 --> 00:10:33,728
- KAGOME!

161
00:10:33,762 --> 00:10:37,195
- YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY TOO BAD
THAT YOU'VE COME BACK.

162
00:10:37,228 --> 00:10:39,462
- IT'S A SHAME
YOU DIDN'T STAY AWAY LONGER.

163
00:10:39,495 --> 00:10:42,195
- NOW, WHAT KIND OF GREETING
IS THAT?

164
00:10:42,228 --> 00:10:43,162
- DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?

165
00:10:43,195 --> 00:10:46,128
- TECHNICALLY SPEAKING,
IT'S ABOUT TO START.

166
00:10:46,162 --> 00:10:47,995
- STOP WITH THE MUMBO JUMBO.

167
00:10:48,028 --> 00:10:49,395
- DEFINITELY CATS.

168
00:10:49,428 --> 00:10:51,428
- LOTS AND LOTS OF CATS.

169
00:10:51,462 --> 00:10:53,962
- CATS?

170
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:55,362
- HUH?

171
00:10:55,395 --> 00:10:56,328
HUH?

172
00:10:56,362 --> 00:10:59,595
- HA HA! THAT'S THE WAY, JAKEN.
YOU CAN DO IT.

173
00:11:00,595 --> 00:11:02,562
NO, TO THE RIGHT,
IN FRONT OF YOU.

174
00:11:02,595 --> 00:11:04,795
- IN BEHIND?

175
00:11:04,828 --> 00:11:07,928
- NOW LEFT. RIGHT.
ON THE SIDE. OVER THERE.

176
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:10,395
NO, THERE.
- OVER HERE?

177
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,562
I GOT ONE!

178
00:11:11,595 --> 00:11:13,695
I CAUGHT IT WITH MY BARE HANDS!

179
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:15,728
- YOU'RE SO AMAZING, JAKEN.

180
00:11:15,762 --> 00:11:17,128
YOU'RE THE GREATEST.

181
00:11:17,162 --> 00:11:19,462
- I AM GREAT!

182
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:37,495
- IF IT ISN'T TORON.

183
00:11:43,328 --> 00:11:47,128
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME,
SESSHOMARU.

184
00:11:47,162 --> 00:11:48,295
- I THOUGHT YOU WERE DEAD.

185
00:11:48,328 --> 00:11:51,462
- THAT'S A FINE WAY
TO GREET SOMEONE.

186
00:11:51,495 --> 00:11:54,795
THIS TIME, I'M GOING
TO SETTLE THINGS
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

187
00:11:54,828 --> 00:11:57,428
- WE SETTLED THINGS
A LONG TIME AGO,

188
00:11:57,462 --> 00:11:59,195
BUT IF YOU INSIST.

189
00:11:59,228 --> 00:12:02,662
YOU WON'T BE AS LUCKY
AS YOU WERE 50 YEARS AGO.

190
00:12:02,695 --> 00:12:05,828
- YOU'RE STILL AS BOORISH
AS EVER, I SEE.

191
00:12:05,862 --> 00:12:07,695
I AGREE THAT THINGS
WILL BE DIFFERENT

192
00:12:07,728 --> 00:12:11,062
FROM HOW THEY TURNED OUT
50 YEARS AGO, THOUGH.

193
00:12:11,095 --> 00:12:14,762
OUR MASTER IS WAITING FOR YOU.

194
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:16,028
- MASTER?

195
00:12:16,062 --> 00:12:18,828
- YES, THE ONE WHO LEADS
THE PANTHER TRIBE.

196
00:12:18,862 --> 00:12:21,728
I REALIZE YOUR DEAR FATHER
IS DEAD,

197
00:12:21,762 --> 00:12:25,595
BUT OUR MASTER
IS GOING TO BE RESURRECTED

198
00:12:25,628 --> 00:12:27,762
AT LONG LAST.

199
00:12:27,795 --> 00:12:29,462
- RESURRECTED?

200
00:12:29,495 --> 00:12:30,428
FOR WHAT PURPOSE?

201
00:12:30,462 --> 00:12:32,695
- TO ATTACK THE LANDS
IN THE EAST ONCE AGAIN,

202
00:12:32,728 --> 00:12:37,662
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY,
TO GET OUR REVENGE
ON ALL YOUR KIND.

203
00:12:37,695 --> 00:12:41,328
- I WILL PERSONALLY SEE TO IT
THAT HE NEVER BREATHES AGAIN.

204
00:12:41,362 --> 00:12:45,162
- I'M GLAD TO HEAR YOU'VE
ACCEPTED MY CHALLENGE.

205
00:12:45,195 --> 00:12:48,062
COME, NOW,
DON'T BE SO HASTY.

206
00:12:48,095 --> 00:12:50,328
WE WON'T BATTLE IT OUT HERE.

207
00:12:50,362 --> 00:12:53,062
COME TO OUR CASTLE.

208
00:12:53,562 --> 00:12:58,995
THEN YOU CAN BRING
ALL THE REINFORCEMENTS
THAT YOU REQUIRE.

209
00:13:03,962 --> 00:13:06,195
- LORD SESSHOMARU!

210
00:13:06,228 --> 00:13:09,162
LOOK AT HOW MANY FISH JAKEN
AND I JUST CAUGHT.

211
00:13:09,195 --> 00:13:10,862
- DON'T LEAVE ME BEHIND!

212
00:13:10,895 --> 00:13:13,328
- LORD SESSHOMARU!

213
00:13:13,362 --> 00:13:15,162
[PANTING]
SEE?

214
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,395
- JAKEN.

215
00:13:16,428 --> 00:13:17,228
- YES?

216
00:13:17,262 --> 00:13:19,262
- THE PANTHER DEMON TRIBE
IS BACK.

217
00:13:19,295 --> 00:13:22,528
- AAH! WHAT ARE THEY
DOING HERE AGAIN?

218
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:24,028
- RIN, LISTEN.
- YES?

219
00:13:24,062 --> 00:13:26,228
- YOU ARE TO WAIT HERE
WITH AUN.

220
00:13:26,262 --> 00:13:29,228
- ALL RIGHT.
I WON'T MOVE FROM HERE.

221
00:13:29,262 --> 00:13:30,528
- UH-HUH!

222
00:13:30,562 --> 00:13:32,362
WAIT, MY LORD!

223
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:35,495
- DON'T FORGET TO COME BACK
AND GET US.

224
00:13:35,528 --> 00:13:37,728
WE'LL BE WAITING.

225
00:13:39,428 --> 00:13:40,628
- CAT DEMONS, YOU SAY?

226
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:42,028
- YOU KNOW,
I DISTINCTLY REMEMBER

227
00:13:42,062 --> 00:13:45,962
SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THIS
HAPPENING 50 YEARS AGO.

228
00:13:45,995 --> 00:13:47,195
- 50 YEARS AGO?

229
00:13:47,228 --> 00:13:51,228
- YEAH. A TRIBE OF CATS SWARMED
IN AND ATTACKED FROM THE WEST.

230
00:13:51,262 --> 00:13:52,362
- ARE YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

231
00:13:52,395 --> 00:13:54,595
SOUNDS LIKE ONE
OF YOUR TALL TALES.

232
00:13:54,628 --> 00:13:56,062
- WAIT A MINUTE, INUYASHA.

233
00:13:56,095 --> 00:13:57,895
DON'T YOU THINK
IT COULD HAVE HAPPENED

234
00:13:57,928 --> 00:14:00,195
WHILE YOU WERE SEALED
TO THAT TREE?

235
00:14:00,228 --> 00:14:02,495
- I GUESS,
BUT I WOULDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT.

236
00:14:02,528 --> 00:14:04,062
- I'VE NEVER HEARD OF IT EITHER.

237
00:14:04,095 --> 00:14:05,995
- MAYBE THAT'S 'CAUSE
YOU'RE JUST A BRAT.

238
00:14:06,028 --> 00:14:08,128
- AM NOT! QUIT TREATING ME
LIKE A KID!

239
00:14:08,162 --> 00:14:09,828
- SO, WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED?

240
00:14:09,862 --> 00:14:13,428
- I ESCAPED BEFORE
THE CAT DEMONS ARRIVED.

241
00:14:13,462 --> 00:14:15,195
- NOW IT'S BELIEVABLE.

242
00:14:15,228 --> 00:14:18,862
- I RETURNED AFTER I HEARD THEY
HAD ALL LEFT, AND SURE ENOUGH,

243
00:14:18,895 --> 00:14:22,962
THERE WASN'T A SINGLE CAT DEMON
IN SIGHT.

244
00:14:22,995 --> 00:14:24,062
- WHERE WERE THEY?

245
00:14:24,095 --> 00:14:27,028
- OH, DEARIE ME, I'M AFRAID
THAT'S ALL I CAN REMEMBER.

246
00:14:27,062 --> 00:14:31,662
- THE STORIES ARE TRUE. YOU ARE
A STRANGELY DRESSED PRIESTESS.

247
00:14:31,695 --> 00:14:32,895
- THE CAT DEMONS!

248
00:14:32,928 --> 00:14:36,562
- STOP CALLING US CATS,
YOU LITTLE RACCOON DOG.

249
00:14:36,595 --> 00:14:39,295
- EXCUSE ME, I'M A FOX.

250
00:14:39,328 --> 00:14:42,562
- WHO ARE YOU,
AND WHAT DO YOU WANT?

251
00:14:43,162 --> 00:14:44,962
- IT'S NOT YOU
THAT WE'RE AFTER.

252
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:48,262
WE WANT THE PRIESTESS
WITH THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

253
00:14:48,295 --> 00:14:50,895
- WELL, YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET
THROUGH ME FIRST,

254
00:14:50,928 --> 00:14:52,695
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

255
00:14:52,728 --> 00:14:55,195
- HA! YOU'RE A HALF-DEMON.

256
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,428
- GOT A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

257
00:14:56,462 --> 00:14:59,295
- YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN
TO BE INUYASHA?

258
00:14:59,328 --> 00:15:01,528
- HUH?
- YOU KNOW THIS DEMON?

259
00:15:01,562 --> 00:15:03,495
- I'VE NEVER SEEN HER BEFORE.

260
00:15:03,528 --> 00:15:08,395
- YOU MUST BE HIM,
SESSHOMARU'S BROTHER.

261
00:15:09,362 --> 00:15:13,328
- HUH, YEAH, WE'RE NOT EXACTLY
A CLOSE-KNIT FAMILY.

262
00:15:13,362 --> 00:15:15,228
- LET ME TAKE ON INUYASHA.

263
00:15:15,262 --> 00:15:18,928
SHURON, YOU HANDLE THE MONK
AND THE DEMON SLAYER.

- NOW BRING IT ON!

266
00:15:25,762 --> 00:15:27,395
- I WON'T KILL YOU NOW,

267
00:15:27,428 --> 00:15:31,195
BUT IT SURE WILL BE
A GOOD FIGHT.

268
00:15:32,862 --> 00:15:35,362
JUST TRY AND COME AFTER ME.

269
00:15:35,395 --> 00:15:38,395
- SURE! IT'S YOUR FUNERAL!

270

- AAH!

00:15:41,995 --> 00:15:44,595
- WATCH OUT, SANGO!

00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:48,495
WHAT'S THAT?

- [LAUGHS]

00:16:19,495 --> 00:16:23,562
SHE HAS THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,
ALL RIGHT.

281
00:16:23,595 --> 00:16:27,162
- KAGOME!

- HUH. THAT GIRL SEEMS TO MEAN
A LOT TO YOU, INUYASHA.

283
00:16:38,043 --> 00:16:41,309
- YEAH, AND YOU'D
BETTER LET HER GO.

284
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:44,609
- YOU'LL HAVE TO
COME TO OUR CASTLE
IF YOU WANT HER BACK--

IF YOU CAN, THAT IS.

WE'LL BE WAITING FOR YOU,

OUT OF MY WAY!

00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:56,676
DAMN IT! I'LL GET THEM.

- HOW'S KIRARA?

- SHE'S FINE. I'M SURE
SHE'LL COME TO IN A MINUTE.

- MY LORD,
I'LL BE LEAVING NOW.

WHERE'D THEY GET TO?

- CALM DOWN, INUYASHA.

THIS PLACE REEKS
OF THE CAT STENCH.

DOESN'T INTEND TO TAKE
THOSE DEMONS ON ALONE.

EVEN FOR SOMEONE
AS STRONG AS MY MASTER.
