AFTER THAT, I COULDN'T
GET HER OUT OF MY MIND.

317
00:19:33,764 --> 00:19:37,330
SHE WAS ALWAYS BY MY SIDE...

318
00:19:37,364 --> 00:19:40,730
AND I...BY HERS.

319
00:19:43,397 --> 00:19:45,097
- ME? BECOME A HUMAN?

320
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,030
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

321
00:19:46,064 --> 00:19:47,697
IT'S TRUE THAT
YOU ARE HALF DEMON,

322
00:19:47,730 --> 00:19:49,297
BUT YOU ARE ALSO HALF HUMAN.

323
00:19:49,330 --> 00:19:51,497
IF THE SACRED JEWEL
OF THE 4 SOULS

324
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,030
FELL INTO THE HANDS OF A DEMON,

325
00:19:53,064 --> 00:19:55,830
THEIR POWERS WOULD
UNDOUBTEDLY INCREASE.

326
00:19:55,864 --> 00:19:59,864
HOWEVER, IF IT WERE USED
TO TURN YOU INTO A HUMAN,
IT WOULD BE PURIFIED.

327
00:19:59,897 --> 00:20:05,764
THE JEWEL OF THE 4 SOULS
WOULD PROBABLY CEASE TO EXIST.

328
00:20:05,797 --> 00:20:06,897
- AND THEN WHAT?

329
00:20:06,930 --> 00:20:08,730
WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO YOU?

330
00:20:08,764 --> 00:20:12,764
- MY DUTY IS
TO PROTECT THE JEWEL.

331
00:20:12,797 --> 00:20:17,597
WITHOUT IT, I COULD LIVE
THE LIFE OF AN ORDINARY WOMAN.

I HAD NO SECOND THOUGHTS.

I KNEW I COULD LIVE

I'D LONGED FOR SUCH A LIFE.

BUT THE DAY SHE WAS
TO BRING ME THE JEWEL...

339

- HUH?

UGH!

HUH?

- DIE, INUYASHA!

343
00:20:56,730 --> 00:20:58,664
- [VOICE-OVER]
SHE BETRAYED ME!

KIKYO BETRAYED ME!

345
00:20:59,997 --> 00:21:04,764
AS SOON AS I LET DOWN MY GUARD,
SHE TRIED TO SLAY ME.

346
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,764
I MANAGED TO DODGE THE ARROWS

347
00:21:06,797 --> 00:21:10,530
AND WENT TO THE VILLAGE
TO STEAL THE JEWEL.

00:21:10,897 --> 00:21:15,030
AND THAT'S WHEN
SHE BOUND ME TO THE TREE.

BETRAY ME, INUYASHA?

- HOW DID IT COME TO THIS?

AAH!

HOW DID IT GO SO WRONG?

IT WASN'T SUPPOSED
TO BE LIKE THIS!

BURYING HER HATRED OF INUYASHA,

358

AND OUR JOURNEY IN SEARCH

THIS GUY ISN'T A DEMON.

WELL, WHATEVER HE IS,

HE SURE HAS A LOT OF POWER
IN HIS RIGHT HAND.

363
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:59,227
IS HE AN ALLY, A FOE,
