00:07:46,008 --> 00:07:46,942
>> YES.

175
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:48,308
SOMETHING TELLS ME THE FLASH

176
00:07:48,308 --> 00:07:49,575
THEY SPEAK OF HAS SOMETHING

177
00:07:49,575 --> 00:07:50,842
TO DO WITH THE DEMONIC AURA

178
00:07:50,842 --> 00:07:52,042
WE FELT EARLIER.

179
00:07:52,042 --> 00:07:53,275
>> SPEAKING OF WHICH, THE AURA

180
00:07:53,275 --> 00:07:54,642
SEEMS TO HAVE DISAPPEARED.

181
00:07:54,642 --> 00:07:59,075
>> YEAH, I DON'T SENSE IT NOW.

182
00:07:59,075 --> 00:08:02,575
>> LADY SARA, LADY SARA.

183
00:08:02,575 --> 00:08:05,608
>> HER BODY, HOW HORRIBLE.

184
00:08:05,608 --> 00:08:06,742
>> OVER THERE, KAGOME!

185
00:08:06,742 --> 00:08:08,375
THE BEDDING HAS A CLEAR OUTLINE

186
00:08:08,375 --> 00:08:10,675
OF A HUMAN BODY.

187
00:08:10,675 --> 00:08:11,708
>> YOU'RE RIGHT, AND IT'S NOT

188
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,008

WITH THE LIGHT.

193
00:08:20,008 --> 00:08:21,008
>> VANISHED?

194
00:08:21,008 --> 00:08:28,175
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

195
00:08:28,175 --> 00:08:29,985
>> SAY, MASTER JAKEN, LET'S PLAY

00:08:39,252 --> 00:08:40,185
>> ONE MORE TIME.

205
00:08:40,185 --> 00:08:41,052
RED JAKEN, BLUE JAKEN,

>> FORGET IT.

208
00:08:42,585 --> 00:08:43,385
>> WHY NOT?

209
00:08:43,385 --> 00:08:44,352
SAY IT!

210
00:08:44,352 --> 00:08:48,452

SUCH A STRANGE MORTAL.

312
00:12:48,052 --> 00:12:49,885
LORD SESSHOMARU, WHO WAS THAT

313
00:12:49,885 --> 00:12:51,652
ODD WOMAN ANYWAY?

314
00:12:51,652 --> 00:12:53,885

MIRACLES.

317
00:12:56,618 --> 00:12:58,552
HONESTLY, AS IF A MERE HUMAN

318
00:12:58,552 --> 00:13:00,318
CAN HELP OUR LORD.

319
00:13:00,318 --> 00:13:02,118
>> ARE YOU BLIND, JAKEN?

320
00:13:02,118 --> 00:13:03,818
>> HUH?

321
00:13:03,818 --> 00:13:06,652
>> THAT WAS NO HUMAN.

322
00:13:06,652 --> 00:13:07,318
>> HUH?

323
00:13:07,318 --> 00:13:09,485
IT WASN'T?

324
00:13:09,485 --> 00:13:10,818
>> IT WAS A DEMON.

325
00:13:10,818 --> 00:13:12,318
NOW, PERHAPS SHE WAS ORIGINALLY

326
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:14,485
HUMAN, BUT NEVER QUITE BECAME

327
00:13:14,485 --> 00:13:19,485
A FULL DEMON.

328
00:13:19,485 --> 00:13:22,485
>> WHAT?

329
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:23,152
>> I WONDER WHAT CAUSED

330
00:13:23,152 --> 00:13:26,452
THAT EXPLOSION AT THE CONVENT.

331
00:13:26,452 --> 00:13:27,552
>> WHO KNOWS.

332
00:13:27,552 --> 00:13:28,485
>> I'VE HEARD THAT WHEN

333
00:13:28,485 --> 00:13:29,985

334
00:13:29,985 --> 00:13:31,452
RAPIDLY AS THE ONE WE WITNESSED,

335
00:13:31,452 --> 00:13:32,252
IT CAN ACTUALLY CAUSE

336
00:13:32,252 --> 00:13:33,652
EXPLOSIONS.

337
00:13:33,652 --> 00:13:34,885
BUT WHAT PUZZLES ME EVEN MORE

338
00:13:34,885 --> 00:13:36,218
THAN THE EXPLOSIONS IS WHY

339
00:13:36,218 --> 00:13:38,518
THE BODY OF LADY SARA VANISHED.

340
00:13:38,518 --> 00:13:42,652
ARE THE TWO RELATED?

341
00:13:42,652 --> 00:13:43,585
>> YOU KNOW, I HAVE

342
00:13:43,585 --> 00:13:46,652
A BAD FEELING ABOUT THIS.

343
00:13:46,652 --> 00:13:47,685
>> I'M NOT SURPRISED,

344
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,052
BUT YOU GOT TO ADMIT IT'S GOT

345
00:13:49,052 --> 00:13:50,918
NOTHING TO DO WITH US.

346
