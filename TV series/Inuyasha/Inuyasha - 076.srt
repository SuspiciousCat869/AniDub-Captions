162
00:09:17,242 --> 00:09:20,842
AND THEY CURSED YOUR FATHER
AND HIS FAMILY FOR ALL ETERNITY

163
00:09:20,875 --> 00:09:23,808

ONE DAY GET THEIR REVENGE.

WRATH LASTS 7 GENERATIONS?

IN THE GREAT WAR,
EITHER.

COMING AFTER HIM

- WHAT WERE YOU DOING
WHEN ALL OF THIS WAS GOING ON?

TO HIMSELF

WE COULD OFFER TO HELP HIM!

THE PANTHER TRIBE
A LONG TIME AGO.

- OH, THAT!
MYOGA TOLD ME!

BUT I THOUGHT SESSHOMARU DIDN'T
EVEN FIGHT IN THAT BATTLE.

YOUR FATHER
HAD PASSED ON,

BUT THEY CAME TO RAVAGE
THE COUNTRYSIDE

AND KILL
HIS PEOPLE!

- FORGIVE ME,
BUT I ACTED ON MY OWN

368

AND WENT TO FETCH INUYASHA!

369

HE MAY BE A HALF-DEMON,

370
00:18:46,045 --> 00:18:48,111
BUT HE'S
STILL YOUR FATHER'S SON!

- I SEE.
WHERE IS HE?

372
00:18:50,778 --> 00:18:53,745
WHAT, IS HE TOO COWARDLY
TO SHOW HIMSELF?

373
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:57,345
OR DID HE SIMPLY REFUSE TO COME
TO HIS BROTHER'S AID?

374
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:01,511
- NEITHER, I'M AFRAID THAT
HE'S BEEN PLACED UNDER A SPELL!

- A SPELL?

- INDEED.

377
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,411
HE LOST HIS HEART
TO A MORTAL PRIESTESS

378
00:19:06,445 --> 00:19:08,811
AND FELL PREY
TO HER SACRED POWERS.

379
00:19:08,845 --> 00:19:11,045
- HOW FOOLISH OF HIM.

380
00:19:11,078 --> 00:19:13,778
- YES. WHO ARE THOSE DEMONS?

381
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:17,378
- MY FATHER SAVED THEM
IN THE GREAT WAR.

- WE HAVE ALLIES!
HOW WONDERFUL!

383
00:19:20,945 --> 00:19:22,311
I WAS CONCERNED,
I ADMIT,

384
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:25,545
BUT NOW THAT YOUR FATHER'S
ALLIES HAVE COME TO OUR AID,

385
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:28,778
WE CAN GO INTO BATTLE
WITH CONFIDENCE.

386
00:19:30,945 --> 00:19:32,878
UGH!

387
00:19:32,911 --> 00:19:36,178
OF COURSE, LORD SESSHOMARU
HAD NEVER EXPECTED YOU

388

TO COME TO HIS ASSISTANCE.

389
00:19:37,478 --> 00:19:40,845

SO EASY IF WE HAD THE

BY YOUR FATHER.

- HA! SESSHOMARU CAN'T WIELD
MY SWORD!

392
00:19:46,378 --> 00:19:49,545
- THAT'S NOT THE POINT,
YOU UNGRATEFUL SON!

393
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:52,478
- WOULD YOU STOP HARPING ON ME
ABOUT THE PAST?

394
00:19:52,511 --> 00:19:54,845

NO, WAIT!

I'M GLAD YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

406
00:20:18,745 --> 00:20:21,511
- SO, IS THIS
SOME KIND OF PRISON CELL

407
00:20:21,545 --> 00:20:22,611
THEY'VE PUT US IN?

408
00:20:22,645 --> 00:20:25,378
- YES, AND WE'RE NOT
THE ONLY PEOPLE IN HERE,
EITHER.

00:20:25,411 --> 00:20:27,678
- WHO ELSE IS IN HERE?

DO YOU THINK THEY'RE
THE VILLAGERS?

413
00:20:35,811 --> 00:20:38,045
- NO WONDER THERE WAS NO SIGN
OF LIFE IN THE TOWN.

414
00:20:38,078 --> 00:20:39,945
- YEAH, I THINK IT WAS
LIKE A SECRET VILLAGE.

415
00:20:39,978 --> 00:20:43,245
I GATHER THAT THESE ARE
THE PEOPLE WHO ESCAPED THE WARS.

TO HIDE AND LIVE IN PEACE.
