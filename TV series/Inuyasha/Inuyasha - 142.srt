00:10:19,854 --> 00:10:38,687
THE MASTER THAT HE CHOSE.

174
00:10:38,687 --> 00:10:52,254
I'M THE VICTOR.

175
00:10:52,254 --> 00:10:56,920
HA HA HA HA. BEHOLD!

176
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,320
I AM THE RIDER OF ENTEI!

177
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:11,687
ONWARD, ENTEI!

178
00:11:11,687 --> 00:11:13,187
ENTEI, WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY

179
00:11:13,187 --> 00:11:17,054
SEE IN THIS CHILD?

180
00:11:17,054 --> 00:11:18,654
WATCH THIS.

181
00:11:18,654 --> 00:11:20,320
>> HA HA HA.

182
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,354
>> THE KID.

183
00:11:22,354 --> 00:11:25,554
>> YAH!

184
00:11:25,554 --> 00:11:28,154
HUH? WHERE'D HE GO?

185
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:29,987
>> OVER HERE.

186
00:11:29,987 --> 00:11:39,720
>> WHY, YOU LITTLE RAT.

187
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:42,420
DAMN YOU. ENOUGH!

188
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,254
AAH!

189
00:11:46,254 --> 00:11:53,220
AAH!

190
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,254
AM I GOING TO DIE?

191
00:11:56,254 --> 00:12:00,754
SLAIN BY A MERE CHILD.

192
00:12:00,754 --> 00:12:08,220
NO! AH...

193
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,954
>> NOT TOO BAD.

194
00:12:09,954 --> 00:12:10,987
>> ISN'T IT A LITTLE

195
00:12:10,987 --> 00:12:12,020
BIG FOR YOU?

196
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,320
>> SAVE YOUR WISECRACKS.

197
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,487
I HAVE TO FOCUS ON GETTING USED

198
00:12:14,487 --> 00:12:17,420
TO MY NEW BODY.

199
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:18,887
>> THIS KID'S DIFFERENT

200
00:12:18,887 --> 00:12:20,520
FROM NARAKU.

201
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:21,587
HE DOESN'T MIND

202
00:12:21,587 --> 00:12:25,854
GETTING HIS HANDS DIRTY.

203
00:12:25,854 --> 00:12:37,620
>> NOW, THEN...

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,554
>> LOOKS LIKE EVERYONE

205
00:12:38,554 --> 00:12:39,520
WHO LIVED HERE WAS KILLED

206
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,387
IN THE ATTACK.

207
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:41,187
>> DO YOU THINK

208
00:12:41,187 --> 00:12:42,654
RYGOKOKI DID THIS?

209
00:12:42,654 --> 00:12:47,754
>> COME HERE! LOOK AT THIS!

210
00:12:47,754 --> 00:12:50,420
>> A HORSE'S HOOF MARK.

211
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,520
>> IT'S ENORMOUS.

212
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:52,354
>> WE'D BETTER FIND THEM

213
00:12:52,354 --> 00:12:53,587
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

214
00:12:53,587 --> 00:12:54,520
>> ENTEI'S HOOFPRINTS

215
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,720
COME FROM THAT DIRECTION, BUT

216
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,520
THEY COME TO A STOP RIGHT HERE.

217
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:58,454
>> THEN THIS IS WHERE HE

218
00:12:58,454 --> 00:12:59,820
MUST HAVE TAKEN OFF FROM.

219
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:00,820
>> SO HE PROBABLY FLEW OFF

220
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,420
IN THIS DIRECTION.

221
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:03,754
>> HUH? WHAT'S THAT?

222
00:13:03,754 --> 00:13:05,020
>> IS SOMETHING WRONG?

223
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:06,387
>> I KNOW THIS SCENT.

224
00:13:06,387 --> 00:13:08,220
>> STAY ON YOUR TOES, EVERYONE.

225
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:09,920
AN AURA, DEMONIC AURA,

226
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:25,920
IS HEADED THIS WAY.

227
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,254
>> AAH!

228
00:13:28,254 --> 00:13:34,487
>> IT'S ENTEI! HUH!

229
00:13:34,487 --> 00:13:37,087
>> YOU GOT GUTS COMING TO ME.

230
00:13:37,087 --> 00:13:40,320
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT MUCH.

231
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,520
WIND STAR!

232
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,754
>> IT'S GOING TO HIT HIM

233
00:13:45,754 --> 00:13:52,920
THIS TIME!

234
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:54,887
>> A BARRIER?

235
00:13:54,887 --> 00:13:56,420
>> HUH?

236
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,587
>> HA HA HA.

237
00:13:58,587 --> 00:14:01,120
THAT'S SOME GREETING, INUYASHA.

238
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:01,987
>> WHO IS THAT?

239
00:14:01,987 --> 00:14:02,587
>> I DON'T KNOW,

240
00:14:02,587 --> 00:14:04,120
BUT IT'S NOT RYGOKOKI.

241
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,354
>> YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT HIM.

242
00:14:05,354 --> 00:14:07,554
I KILLED RYGOKOKI.

243
00:14:07,554 --> 00:14:09,087
>> WHO IS HE?

244
00:14:09,087 --> 00:14:11,120
>> IT SEEMS ENTEI HERE

245
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,554
HAS CHOSEN ME AS HIS MASTER

246
00:14:13,554 --> 00:14:19,387
AFTER WITNESSING MY STRENGTH.

247
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,720
>> IT'S A KID.

248
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,954
>> HE'S JUST A CHILD.

249
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:23,154
>> OR MAYBE HE CHOSE ME

250
00:14:23,154 --> 00:14:25,354
FOR RELEASING HIM FROM THE SEAL.

251
00:14:25,354 --> 00:14:26,454
>> YOU MEAN YOU'RE THE ONE

252
00:14:26,454 --> 00:14:28,587
WHO SET THIS DEMON HORSE FREE?

253
00:14:28,587 --> 00:14:29,254
>> THAT CAN'T BE.

254
00:14:29,254 --> 00:14:30,487
IT WAS KAGURA AND THE INFANT

255
00:14:30,487 --> 00:14:31,787
WHO BROKE THE SEAL.

256
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,620
>> AND THE INFANT

257
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:33,420
WAS SPLIT IN TWO

258
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:35,020
BY THE MONK'S SPIRITUAL POWER.

259
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,554
HE COULDN'T HAVE LIVED.

260
00:14:36,554 --> 00:14:39,287
>> HA. YOU ARE SO NAIVE.

261
00:14:39,287 --> 00:14:40,820
THE SPIRITUAL POWERS OF A HUMAN

262
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,654
MONK COULDN'T KILL ME.

263
00:14:42,654 --> 00:14:43,887
>> WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

264
00:14:43,887 --> 00:14:47,187
DOES THAT MEAN YOU'RE THAT BABY?

265
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:49,887
>> I AM HAKUDOSHI.

266
00:14:49,887 --> 00:14:50,854
AS YOU'VE GUESSED,

267
00:14:50,854 --> 00:14:53,120
I'M NARAKU'S INCARNATION.

268
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,320
>> HAKUDOSHI?

269
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,120
>> SO YOU ARE ONE

270
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:56,654
OF NARAKU'S CREATIONS.

271
00:14:56,654 --> 00:14:58,420
>> HAKUDOSHI, I'VE HEARD

272
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,687
THAT YOU'VE KILLED MANY MONKS

273
00:14:59,687 --> 00:15:00,787
AND PRIESTS IN YOUR SEARCH

274
00:15:00,787 --> 00:15:01,720
OF THE BORDER BETWEEN

275
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:03,320
THIS WORLD AND THE NEXT.

276
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:04,487
WHAT'S THERE?

277
00:15:04,487 --> 00:15:06,054
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

278
00:15:06,054 --> 00:15:08,454
>> HA HA HA. I WILL SEARCH

279
00:15:08,454 --> 00:15:10,120
FOR THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

280
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,854
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

281
00:15:11,854 --> 00:15:12,654
>> YOU'RE LOOKING

282
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:14,187
FOR THE JEWEL SHARD?

283
00:15:14,187 --> 00:15:15,087
>> WATCH WHAT YOU'RE

284
00:15:15,087 --> 00:15:16,087
SAYING, KID.

285
00:15:16,087 --> 00:15:17,587
YOU'RE GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH.

286
00:15:17,587 --> 00:15:19,087
>> THERE'S NO NEED TO HIDE IT.

287
00:15:19,087 --> 00:15:20,020
>> THERE ISN'T?

288
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:21,087
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

289
00:15:21,087 --> 00:15:22,120
>> AS THE SAYING GOES,

290
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,487
THE MORE, THE MERRIER.

291
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,887
YOU SHOULD BE GRATEFUL THAT I'VE

292
00:15:24,887 --> 00:15:27,387
GIVEN YOU THAT LITTLE LEAD.

293
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,220
>> HE SEEMS TO BE TELLING

294
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,587
THE TRUTH ABOUT THE SHARD.

295
00:15:29,587 --> 00:15:31,087
THAT MUCH IS CERTAIN.

296
00:15:31,087 --> 00:15:32,454
>> I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT

297
00:15:32,454 --> 00:15:34,120
THE NEXT WORLD OR WHATEVER,

298
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,020
BUT IF THERE'S A SHARD

299
00:15:35,020 --> 00:15:36,120
TO BE FOUND THERE,

300
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:45,454
THEN GO FIND IT YOURSELF! YAH!

301
00:15:45,454 --> 00:15:52,954
DAMN IT.

302
00:15:52,954 --> 00:15:54,354
>> HE GOT AWAY.

303
00:15:54,354 --> 00:15:57,054
>> I WON'T LET THEM ESCAPE.

304
00:15:57,054 --> 00:16:01,387
I'LL FIND THEM. YOU JUST WATCH.

305
00:16:01,387 --> 00:16:03,754
>> WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO NOW?

306
00:16:03,754 --> 00:16:05,920
KILL ANOTHER MONK OR PRIEST?

307
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,287
>> I'M DONE WITH THEM.

308
00:16:07,287 --> 00:16:08,454
HUMANS AREN'T STRONG ENOUGH

309
00:16:08,454 --> 00:16:10,487
FOR ME NOW.

310
00:16:10,487 --> 00:16:13,020
I LOOKED INSIDE THE MONK'S SOUL

311
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:15,287
BEFORE HE SPLIT ME IN TWO.

312
00:16:15,287 --> 00:16:16,454
WAS THAT THE BORDER I SAW

313
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:17,420
BETWEEN THIS WORLD

314
00:16:17,420 --> 00:16:19,020
AND THE NEXT?

315
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:22,287
IT WAS A WORLD OF WHITE MISTS.

316
00:16:22,287 --> 00:16:23,320
I NEED TO LEARN MORE

317
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:29,720
ABOUT THE PLACE, WHICH MEANS...

318
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:32,320
I NEED DEMONS.

319
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,487
>> ARE YOU SERIOUS?

320
00:16:33,487 --> 00:16:34,420
>> FIND ME SOME DEMONS

321
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:35,954
THAT APPEAR TO BE STRONG.

322
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:38,272
>> HUH? DEMONS?

323
00:16:55,006 --> 00:16:57,306
>> AND SO YOU HAVEN'T NOTICED

324
00:16:57,306 --> 00:16:59,106
ANYTHING IN THIS AREA EITHER?

325
00:16:59,106 --> 00:17:00,672
>> NO. AS YOU CAN SEE,

326
00:17:00,672 --> 00:17:02,472
IT'S VERY PEACEFUL HERE.

327
00:17:02,472 --> 00:17:03,806
>> NO DEMON HORSE

328
00:17:03,806 --> 00:17:05,706
RIDDEN BY A YOUNG CHILD?

329
00:17:05,706 --> 00:17:06,706
>> AFRAID I HAVEN'T SEEN

330
00:17:06,706 --> 00:17:08,006
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

331
00:17:08,006 --> 00:17:08,772
I'M SORRY I HAVEN'T

332
00:17:08,772 --> 00:17:09,839
BEEN MUCH HELP.

333
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:10,672
>> OH, NO. THANK YOU

334
00:17:10,672 --> 00:17:11,906
FOR YOUR TIME.

335
00:17:11,906 --> 00:17:12,939
>> SO FAR, WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE

336
00:17:12,939 --> 00:17:14,606
TO COME UP WITH A SINGLE CLUE.

337
00:17:14,606 --> 00:17:15,739
>> IT'S ODD, THOUGH.

338
00:17:15,739 --> 00:17:17,239
EVER SINCE HAKUDOSHI ESCAPED

339
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:18,372
FROM US, THERE HASN'T BEEN

340
00:17:18,372 --> 00:17:19,806
ANY WORD OF NEW ATTACKS ON

341
00:17:19,806 --> 00:17:21,906
