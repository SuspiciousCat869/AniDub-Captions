FOR ALL KINDS OF POISON.

317
00:17:37,466 --> 00:17:39,100
I'LL BREW SOME UP FOR YOU LATER.

318
00:17:39,133 --> 00:17:41,366
AND THIS HERB MAKES
A GOOD ANTISEPTIC.

319
00:17:41,400 --> 00:17:46,533
IT REALLY WORKS,
BUT, BOY, DOES IT STING!

320
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:50,000
- YOU'VE LEARNED A LOT.
- I GUESS.

321
00:17:50,033 --> 00:17:52,900
- KAGOME, YOU'VE GROWN STRONGER.

322
00:17:52,933 --> 00:17:54,200
- WELL, YOU FINALLY NOTICED.

323
00:17:54,233 --> 00:17:57,400
HOW COULD I NOT GET STRONGER,
RUNNING FROM DEMONS
DAY AFTER DAY?

324
00:17:57,433 --> 00:18:00,633
I'VE LEARNED A LOT MORE
THAN YOUR AVERAGE TEENAGER,

325
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,100
IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

326
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:05,633
AND MY ARCHERY'S
NOT TOO SHABBY, EITHER.

327
00:18:06,533 --> 00:18:08,933
THE BONE EATER'S WELL.

328
00:18:08,966 --> 00:18:13,033
THIS WELL CONNECTS THE PRESENT
WITH THESE TIMES,

329
00:18:13,066 --> 00:18:14,400
THE WARRING STATES ERA.

330
00:18:14,433 --> 00:18:17,666
AND INSIDE MY BODY
WAS THE SACRED JEWEL

331
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:20,700
WHICH SO MANY DEMONS SEEK.

332
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:28,533
THAT'S HOW I CAME TO ARRIVE
IN THIS ERA
AND MET INUYASHA.

333
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,400
[GRUNTING]

334
00:18:34,433 --> 00:18:38,766
- KAGOME, I HAVEN'T ASKED
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

335
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,133
YOU'RE HURT, TOO.

336
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:41,300
- HUH?

337
00:18:41,333 --> 00:18:44,333
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
LUMP ON THE HEAD.

338
00:18:44,366 --> 00:18:45,500
I'M SORRY, INUYASHA.

339
00:18:45,533 --> 00:18:47,833
YOU TOLD ME TO STAY AWAY
FROM SESSHOMARU,

340
00:18:47,866 --> 00:18:50,466
BUT I DIDN'T LISTEN
AND ONLY MADE THINGS WORSE.

341
00:18:50,500 --> 00:18:52,700
IF I HAD RUN AWAY
LIKE YOU TOLD ME,

342
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:55,266
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN
SO SERIOUSLY INJURED.

343
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,666
- NO.
IN THE END,

344
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:59,033
IT WAS YOU WHO SAVED ME
WITH YOUR ARROW.

345
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,833
I'M GRATEFUL, KAGOME.

346
00:19:00,866 --> 00:19:01,966
[THINKING]
- HE'S GRATEFUL?

347
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,933
OK, NOW HE'S OFFICIALLY
FREAKING ME OUT.

348
00:19:04,966 --> 00:19:08,266
YOU'RE ACTING TOTALLY WEIRD NOW.

349
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,733
DO YOU HAVE A FEVER?

350
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:12,200
- WHAT'S INUYASHA DOING,

351
00:19:12,233 --> 00:19:16,566
TAKING KAGOME SO DEEP
INTO THE FOREST?
- SHH.

352
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:17,766
YOU HEARD THE STORY,

353
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:21,133
ABOUT HOW NARAKU
DECEIVED ME 50 YEARS AGO.

354
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:24,300
HE'S THE ONE PULLING THE STRINGS
BEHIND SESSHOMARU.

355
00:19:24,333 --> 00:19:27,533
[THINKING]
- HE FIGURED IT OUT.
I GUESS IT'S NO SURPRISE.

356
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:31,733
INUYASHA'S MORE AWARE
OF NARAKU'S MOVEMENTS
THAN ANYONE.

357
00:19:31,766 --> 00:19:33,566
- I'VE MADE A DECISION.

358
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:34,533
- HUH?

359
00:19:34,566 --> 00:19:36,733
- THINGS ARE GETTING
MORE DANGEROUS BY THE DAY.

360
00:19:36,766 --> 00:19:39,500
- YEAH, YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT.
- HUH?

WHAT'S THAT MEAN?

AREN'T YOU SCARED?

363
00:19:42,433 --> 00:19:43,533
WE'RE IN SERIOUS DANGER!

364
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:46,366
THIS TIME, WE WERE LUCKY,
BUT WHO KNOWS ABOUT NEXT TIME?

365
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:48,033
- WELL, I'M NOT AFRAID!

366
00:19:48,066 --> 00:19:49,900
NARAKU'S A TERRIBLE DEMON.

367
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:53,733
WE'VE GOT TO DO WHAT WE CAN
TO DESTROY HIM.

INUYASHA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

371
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:15,466
- I WAS AFRAID.

- I THOUGHT I WAS
GOING TO LOSE YOU.

374
00:20:21,433 --> 00:20:23,800
I WAS TERRIFIED.

375
00:20:24,566 --> 00:20:27,533
- LET ME GO!
I WANT TO SEE!
WHAT'S HE DOING?

376

- THIS ISN'T SOMETHING
FOR CHILDREN TO SEE.

- I'LL HANG ON TO THE JEWEL.

- WHAT DO YOU THINK
YOU'RE DOING?

HUH?

00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:10,566
- KAGOME IS GONE.

- WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!

388

[GRUNTS]
- WHY'D HE PUSH ME LIKE THAT?

392
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,366
HE'S MORE THAN JUST HALF-DEMON.

I'LL GO BACK
AND TEACH HIM A LESSON!

I'M BACK IN MY OWN TIME.

[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

FOR THE VERY FIRST TIME.

00:23:39,525 --> 00:23:41,091
IF I FIND OUT INUYASHA HUGGED ME

IT HAS TO BE
MORE THAN A COINCIDENCE.
