WAS RENDERED PARALYZED.

WAS NOT STRONG ENOUGH

TO PREVENT YOU
FROM FINDING ME.

I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING

- IT IS CLEAR THAT INUYASHA
WISHES FOR MY DEATH.

THAT IS A GOOD THING,

66
00:05:19,161 --> 00:05:23,394
BECAUSE IT MEANS HE FEELS
REMORSE FOR OUR DISPUTE.

67
00:05:23,428 --> 00:05:26,628
LET HIM FEEL REMORSEFUL.

WHY CAN'T YOU BE SATISFIED
WITH THAT?

HE HASN'T FORGOTTEN YOU
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

HE THINKS OF YOU
ALL THE TIME.

- WHEN INUYASHA AND I PARTED,
WE DESPISED ONE ANOTHER.

81
00:06:03,528 --> 00:06:06,461
THE LOVE YOU SPEAK OF
IS BUT A SHALLOW EMOTION,

82
00:06:06,494 --> 00:06:09,494
AN EMOTION WHICH ONLY SERVED
TO DEEPEN THE HATRED.

83

NOTHING CAN RESOLVE
ONE'S DETERMINATION
FOR EXACTING VENGEANCE

IN THE WAY BITTERNESS CAN.

85

IF HE MUST LOVE, THEN LET HIM
LOVE MY CONSUMING RESENTMENT.

86
00:06:22,494 --> 00:06:24,894
AND IN RETURN,
I SHALL LOVE HIS HEART

WHILE IT FALLS
INTO DEEP DESPAIR.

00:06:29,661 --> 00:06:33,594

TOTALLY POINTLESS. I--

GOT TO TALK TO KIKYO.

93
00:06:43,094 --> 00:06:44,794
PLEASE TELL HER
WHAT HAPPENED--

HOW NARAKU DECEIVED YOU.

INUYASHA?

- KIKYO.

97

- HE DIDN'T HEAR ME.
HE CAN'T EVEN SEE ME.

98
00:07:02,394 --> 00:07:03,894
- SO YOU WERE THE ONE DOING IT--

99
00:07:03,928 --> 00:07:07,461
GATHERING THE SOULS
OF THE DEAD WOMEN.

100
00:07:09,394 --> 00:07:12,894
- MY BODY IS MOLDED
FROM THE EARTH AND
BONES AT MY GRAVESITE.

101
00:07:12,928 --> 00:07:17,794
IT MUST BE SUSTAINED
BY HUMAN SOULS IF
I'M TO REMAIN HERE.

102
00:07:17,828 --> 00:07:20,061
INUYASHA,

103
00:07:20,094 --> 00:07:21,561
YOU MUST DESPISE ME.

104
00:07:21,594 --> 00:07:25,828
I HAVE DRAWN IN THE SOULS OF THE
DEAD TO MAINTAIN MY PRESENCE,

105
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:30,261
AND IT IS MY HATRED OF YOU
THAT FUELS MY ACTIONS.

106
00:07:30,294 --> 00:07:31,461
- THAT'S JUST LUDICROUS.

107
00:07:31,494 --> 00:07:33,861
YOU MAY VERY WELL DESPISE ME,
BUT THE FEELING'S NOT MUTUAL.

108
00:07:33,894 --> 00:07:40,894
KIKYO, I NEVER STOP
THINKING ABOUT YOU,
NOT EVEN FOR AN INSTANT.

109
00:07:45,294 --> 00:07:47,261
- HMM.

110
00:07:50,861 --> 00:07:55,228
- I THOUGHT SO. INUYASHA
HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN KIKYO.

111
00:07:55,261 --> 00:07:56,561
SURE. WHY WOULD HE HAVE?

112
00:07:56,594 --> 00:07:59,194
STILL, IT'S HARD TO HEAR IT
SAID OUT LOUD.

113
00:07:59,228 --> 00:08:03,828
INUYASHA'S BEEN TAKEN AWAY
FROM ME.

114
00:08:03,861 --> 00:08:05,294
WHAT AM I SAYING?

115
00:08:05,328 --> 00:08:09,628
IT'S NOT LIKE HE WAS EVER
MY BOYFRIEND OR ANYTHING.

116
00:08:12,028 --> 00:08:14,561
- I COULD NEVER HATE YOU
OR THINK LESS OF YOU.

117
00:08:14,594 --> 00:08:17,694
IT'S YOUR SPIRIT I CARE FOR,
NOT YOUR APPEARANCE.

118
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:21,928
- TRULY, INUYASHA?
YOU WOULDN'T?

119
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:28,928
YOU WOULDN'T DESPISE ME
IF I USED THESE HANDS
TO STEAL THE LIFE FROM YOU?

- [GRUNTING]

- SHE'S KISSING HIM!

122
00:08:38,461 --> 00:08:40,228
- INUYASHA,
AFTER MEETING YOU,

123
00:08:40,261 --> 00:08:43,661
I RENOUNCED MY POSITION
AS A SHRINE PRIESTESS.

124
00:08:43,694 --> 00:08:45,828
I BECAME AN ORDINARY WOMAN.

125
00:08:45,861 --> 00:08:50,961
I LONGED TO EMBRACE YOU
LIKE THIS WHEN I WAS ALIVE.

126
00:08:55,328 --> 00:08:59,328
- INUYASHA, YOU'RE
GOING TO TAKE HER BACK.

127
00:08:59,361 --> 00:09:02,661
SURE YOU ARE.
IT'S ONLY TO BE EXPECTED.

128
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:06,161
WHAT AM I DOING HERE
WATCHING THEM LIKE THIS?

129
00:09:06,194 --> 00:09:08,394
I'M SUCH A FOOL.
OH, GREAT.

130
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:10,394
NOW I'M PROBABLY
GOING TO START CRYING.

131
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:12,561
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WHAT AN IDIOT I AM.

132
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:15,794
- KIKYO'S SCENT
IS SO FAMILIAR.

133
00:09:15,828 --> 00:09:18,194
HER FRAGRANCE IS
JUST AS IT USED TO BE.

134
00:09:18,228 --> 00:09:20,928
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE
IS THAT SHE HAS NO WARMTH.

135
00:09:20,961 --> 00:09:26,528
HER BODY IS COLD FROM DEATH,
AND SHE'S SAD AND LONELY.

136
00:09:26,561 --> 00:09:29,761
- WE ARE UNABLE TO TURN BACK
THE HANDS OF TIME,

137
00:09:29,794 --> 00:09:34,228
SO PLEASE ALLOW ME
TO EMBRACE YOU A LITTLE LONGER.

138
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:35,861
- I CAN'T SAVE YOU.

139
00:09:35,894 --> 00:09:38,294
I CAN'T DO ANYTHING
TO HELP YOU,

140
00:09:38,328 --> 00:09:40,361
EXCEPT STAY LIKE THIS.

141
00:09:40,394 --> 00:09:42,728
IF ONLY TIME
COULD STAND STILL.

142
00:09:42,761 --> 00:09:47,461
- WOULD YOU AGREE TO THAT
IF I DID STOP TIME?

143
00:09:47,494 --> 00:09:50,594
- YES. I DON'T CARE,
AS LONG AS--

144
00:09:50,628 --> 00:09:53,661
AS LONG AS I'M WITH YOU.

145
00:09:53,694 --> 00:09:54,894
- UHH! I CAN'T WATCH.

146
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,894
I'D BE HAPPY TO LEAVE YOU TWO
ALONE IF YOU'D JUST RELEASE ME.

147
00:09:57,928 --> 00:10:01,461
I'LL JUST GO CRAWL UNDER A ROCK
OR SOMETHING LIKE--

148
00:10:01,494 --> 00:10:04,861
HEY! ARE YOU LISTENING?

149
00:10:09,328 --> 00:10:13,528
- INUYASHA,
I WILL NEVER LET YOU GO.

150
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:17,794
COME WITH ME
TO THE DEPTHS OF HELL.

151
00:10:20,794 --> 00:10:22,694
- HE'S BEING DRAGGED DOWN
WITH HER!

152
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:24,061
INUYASHA, SNAP TO IT!

153
00:10:24,094 --> 00:10:25,861
YOU'VE GOTTA GET OUT OF THERE!

154
00:10:25,894 --> 00:10:28,461
IT'S NO USE.
HE'S UNCONSCIOUS.

155
00:10:28,494 --> 00:10:31,328
LISTEN, KIKYO, 'CAUSE I KNOW
THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME.

156
00:10:31,361 --> 00:10:34,828
THAT'S NOT FAIR. INUYASHA SAID
HE WANTED TO BE WITH YOU.

157
00:10:34,861 --> 00:10:38,661
I DIDN'T HEAR HIM SAY ANYTHING
ABOUT WANTING TO DIE WITH YOU.

158
00:10:38,694 --> 00:10:40,261
INUYASHA'S GOING AFTER NARAKU

159
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:43,028
FOR DECEIVING YOU BOTH
50 YEARS AGO.

160
00:10:43,061 --> 00:10:44,594
HE STILL HAS THINGS TO DO.

161
00:10:44,628 --> 00:10:48,494
INUYASHA WANTS TO LIVE TO FIGHT
NARAKU MORE THAN ANYTHING,

162
00:10:48,528 --> 00:10:55,294
AND HE'S DETERMINED TO STAY
ALIVE UNTIL HE FACES HIM
AND AVENGES YOUR DEATH!

163
00:10:56,828 --> 00:11:00,328
DO YOU UNDERSTAND
WHAT I'M SAYING?

164
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:04,361
AAH!

OH, KIKYO...

- AND WHAT IF HE DOES
EXACT REVENGE?

167
00:11:16,028 --> 00:11:19,761
WILL THAT SERVE
TO REVIVE ME?

168
00:11:21,928 --> 00:11:23,628
COME, INUYASHA.

169
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:28,828
COME, RATHER THAN STAYING HERE
AND LIVING WITH MY MEMORY.

YOU AND I SHARE
THE SAME DESIRES.

THE POOR GUY IS UNCONSCIOUS,
REMEMBER?

173
00:11:36,594 --> 00:11:39,061
OTHERWISE
HE'D NEVER FOLLOW YOU.

174
00:11:39,094 --> 00:11:43,028
DO US ALL A FAVOR
AND LET GO OF INUYASHA!

ONCE AGAIN.

- INUYASHA, NEVER FORGET.

REMEMBER THE FEEL OF MY LIPS
AGAINST YOURS,

NOT TO MENTION
THE LOVELY MAIDEN KIKYO.

- THAT'S RIGHT.

281

HE USED TO SAY THAT
THE SACRED JEWEL
GROWS IN BEAUTY

282

WHEN IT IS TAINTED
WITH MALICE.

283
00:18:17,279 --> 00:18:20,579
- HE FUELED THE HATRED
BETWEEN INUYASHA AND MYSELF,

284
00:18:20,612 --> 00:18:25,312
THEN ATTEMPTED TO STEAL
THE JEWEL THAT HAD BEEN
TAINTED IN THE PROCESS.

285
00:18:25,345 --> 00:18:26,379
- LISTEN, KIKYO.

286
00:18:26,412 --> 00:18:30,379
INUYASHA WAS SERIOUSLY WOUNDED
BY NARAKU ONCE AGAIN.

287
00:18:30,412 --> 00:18:32,345
SO, PLEASE...

288
00:18:32,379 --> 00:18:34,012
- I HAVE HEARD ENOUGH.

289
00:18:34,045 --> 00:18:35,245
I ONLY CAME

290
00:18:35,279 --> 00:18:38,679
BECAUSE I THOUGHT I SHOULD KNOW
THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF MY DEATH.

291
00:18:38,712 --> 00:18:41,479
I NOTICED THAT INUYASHA
HAS CHANGED.

292
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:43,845
HIS FACE HAS
A CERTAIN SOFTNESS.

293
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,912
LONG AGO, HIS EYES
WERE MUCH COLDER,

294
00:18:45,945 --> 00:18:49,745
AND HE THOUGHT HE COULD AFFORD
TO PLACE HIS TRUST IN NO ONE.

295
00:18:49,779 --> 00:18:51,412
- KAGOME IS A STRANGE CHILD.

296
00:18:51,445 --> 00:18:55,845
LITTLE BY LITTLE,
SHE HAS BEEN ABLE TO HEAL
THE WOUNDS OF HIS HEART.

297
00:18:55,879 --> 00:18:58,579
- SO SHE IS
THE ONE RESPONSIBLE.

298
00:18:58,612 --> 00:19:02,012
IT WAS SHE WHO CHANGED INUYASHA.

299
00:19:02,879 --> 00:19:03,979
IF I HAD LIVED,

300
00:19:04,012 --> 00:19:08,479
IT IS I WHO WOULD HAVE TENDED
TO THE WOUNDS IN HIS SOUL.

301
00:19:09,079 --> 00:19:10,045
- PLEASE, KIKYO,

302
00:19:10,079 --> 00:19:13,445
CAN YE NOT BREAK AWAY
FROM THE PAST AND MOVE ON?

303
00:19:13,479 --> 00:19:16,279
- WE SHALL MEET AGAIN.

- [SIGHS]

305
00:19:24,645 --> 00:19:29,745
HOW LONG WILL YE WANDER
THE EARTH, KIKYO?

306
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:54,079
- AAH! UHH...UHH...UH!

307
00:19:54,112 --> 00:19:55,945
OHH...AH!

308
00:19:55,979 --> 00:19:57,912
HMM!

309
00:20:05,712 --> 00:20:07,912
- AND SO SHE HAS LEFT US
ONCE AGAIN.

310
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:12,045
INUYASHA, KAGOME WAS NOT ACTING
HER USUAL SELF.

311
00:20:12,079 --> 00:20:15,012
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU AND KIKYO?

312
00:20:15,045 --> 00:20:18,312
- THE SAME THING THAT GOES
ON WHEN YOU'RE WITH A WOMAN.

313
00:20:18,345 --> 00:20:19,845
- AAH!

314
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:20,845
GHASTLY!

315
00:20:20,879 --> 00:20:23,479
YOU MEAN YOU DID THAT
RIGHT IN FRONT OF KAGOME?

316
00:20:23,512 --> 00:20:26,912
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD EXPLAIN
WHAT YOU DO WITH WOMEN!

317
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:28,312
- NOTHING.

318
00:20:28,345 --> 00:20:30,879
- DO YOU THINK KAGOME
WILL EVER COME BACK?

319
00:20:30,912 --> 00:20:33,245
SHE LOOKED AWFULLY UPSET.

320
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,445
- HMM...

321
00:20:34,479 --> 00:20:39,479
- I NEVER STOP THINKING ABOUT
YOU, NOT EVEN FOR AN INSTANT!

322
00:20:39,512 --> 00:20:41,312
I SPOKE THE TRUTH.

323
00:20:41,345 --> 00:20:45,045
- REMEMBER THE FEEL OF MY LIPS
AGAINST YOURS,

324
00:20:45,079 --> 00:20:47,312
FOR IT WAS REAL.

325
00:20:47,345 --> 00:20:49,379
- AND MY WORDS WERE REAL.

326
00:20:49,412 --> 00:20:53,812
- DOES THAT GIRL MEAN MORE
TO YOU THAN I DO?

327
00:20:53,845 --> 00:20:55,979
- UH...UM...

328
00:20:56,012 --> 00:20:58,079
- NOW WHAT COURSE WILL YOU TAKE,
INUYASHA?

329
00:20:58,112 --> 00:21:01,312
KIKYO CAN'T HAVE
GOTTEN TOO FAR YET.
WILL YOU FOLLOW?

330
00:21:01,345 --> 00:21:03,479
- KAGOME IS MORE IMPORTANT
THAN KIKYO IS,

331
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:07,612
SO HURRY AND MAKE UP
WITH KAGOME, INUYASHA.

332
00:21:14,012 --> 00:21:15,912
- HMM. WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH ME?

333
00:21:15,945 --> 00:21:18,845
I WAS IN SUCH A DAZE,
I FORGOT ALL MY THINGS
BACK HERE.

334
00:21:18,879 --> 00:21:20,512
HEY, CAN ANYONE UP THERE
HEAR ME?

335
00:21:20,545 --> 00:21:24,445
- WHAT WILL YOU DO, INUYASHA?
- WHICH GIRL WILL YOU CHOOSE?

336
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,245
- ANSWER!
- WHICH ONE?

337
00:21:27,279 --> 00:21:29,079
- UH...

338
00:21:29,112 --> 00:21:32,945
I DON'T SUPPOSE I COULD HAVE
BOTH OF THEM.

339
00:21:32,979 --> 00:21:34,279
- MM! YOU TWO-TIMING...

340
00:21:34,312 --> 00:21:38,812
- WELL, IT'S A COMMON PROBLEM
BETWEEN MEN SUCH AS OURSELVES.

341
00:21:38,845 --> 00:21:42,879
AND IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE BOTH,
BUT ANOTHER TO KEEP IT A SECRET,

342
00:21:42,912 --> 00:21:46,179
FOR IF EITHER GIRL
WERE TO FIND OUT--

343
00:21:46,212 --> 00:21:47,812
- SIT!
- AAH!

344
00:21:47,845 --> 00:21:50,879
- THAT'S RIGHT, BIG SIT. HMM?

345
00:21:50,912 --> 00:21:51,812
- [GROANING]

346
00:21:51,845 --> 00:21:54,079
- THEY SAY THAT KARMA
INCLUDES BAD THOUGHTS.

347
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:59,412
- JUST AS WELL. IT SPARED HIM
A GREAT DEAL OF GRIEF.

348
00:22:03,433 --> 00:22:05,766
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

349
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,920
- THE PEOPLE IN A NEARBY TOWN

350
00:23:39,953 --> 00:23:42,120
MAKE A LIVING
EXTERMINATING DEMONS.

351
00:23:42,153 --> 00:23:45,086
IF WE GO THERE, WE MAY BE ABLE
TO FIND OUT SOMETHING

352
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,453
ABOUT THE JEWEL SHARDS.

353
00:23:46,486 --> 00:23:49,353
BUT IT SEEMS THAT
WE AREN'T THE ONLY ONES
WHO HAVE FIGURED THAT OUT.

354
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,320
THE EXTERMINATORS FALL PREY
TO ONE OF THEIR OWN KIND

355
00:23:52,353 --> 00:23:54,353
WHO HAS BEEN POSSESSED
BY A DEMON,

356
00:23:54,386 --> 00:23:56,053
AND A SISTER AND BROTHER
FALL INTO A TRAP.

357
00:23:56,086 --> 00:24:00,786
THE ENTIRE DECEPTION HAS BEEN
LAIN BY NONE OTHER THAN NARAKU.

358
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:02,886
NEXT TIME...

359
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:06,086
SEE YOU SOON!
