A BODY MADE OF CLAY.

318
00:22:04,598 --> 00:22:06,565
KIKYO, WHO DESPISES ME,

319
00:22:06,598 --> 00:22:10,332
WHO TRIED TO MURDER KAGOME.

320
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,098
WHERE ARE YOU...

321
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:16,998
MY KIKYO?

322
00:22:30,617 --> 00:22:34,517
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

323
00:23:57,984 --> 00:24:02,545
- KIKYO HAS GIVEN NARAKU
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD
SHE STOLE FROM ME.

324
00:24:02,578 --> 00:24:04,511
NARAKU'S POWER
CONTINUES TO INCREASE,

325
00:24:04,545 --> 00:24:08,345
AND HE SENDS INCARNATIONS OF
HIMSELF TO HUNT DOWN INUYASHA.

326
00:24:08,378 --> 00:24:12,611
THE MIND-READING GOSHINKI SINKS
HIS FANGS INTO TETSUSAIGA.

327
00:24:12,645 --> 00:24:16,178
OH, NO!
INUYASHA DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE!

328
00:24:16,211 --> 00:24:19,811
WAIT!
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOU?

329
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:21,645
NEXT TIME...

330
00:24:22,445 --> 00:24:23,445
SEE YOU SOON.
