COME IN HANDY, YOU KNOW.

- I AM THE VASSAL ASARTI,
REPRESENTING THE TAKETA CLAN.

WE HAVE COME TO
SPEAK WITH SANGO.

- HUH?

47
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:41,922
- I HAVE BEEN ASKED TO REQUEST

48
00:04:41,955 --> 00:04:43,955
THAT YOU DESTROY A DEMON

49
00:04:43,988 --> 00:04:46,388
THAT PLAGUES OUR CASTLE NIGHTLY.

50
00:04:46,422 --> 00:04:48,255
WE WILL NOT QUESTION
YOUR METHODS,

51
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:52,388
AND IF NECESSARY,
WE WILL EVACUATE THE CASTLE.

52
00:04:52,422 --> 00:04:54,988
CONSIDER THIS
AN ADVANCE PAYMENT.

53
00:04:55,022 --> 00:04:56,822
AFTER THE DEMON IS DESTROYED,

54
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,555
YOU WILL RECEIVE
THE OTHER HALF OF THE SUM.

55
00:04:59,588 --> 00:05:02,155
I BELIEVE THIS OFFER IS FAIR.

56
00:05:02,188 --> 00:05:03,322
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

57
00:05:03,355 --> 00:05:05,488
- BUT THAT'S FAR TOO MUCH MONEY.

58
00:05:05,522 --> 00:05:06,388
- YES.

59
00:05:06,422 --> 00:05:08,755
IT'S 20 TIMES WHAT
SHE NORMALLY GETS PAID.

60
00:05:08,788 --> 00:05:10,622
- THEN YOU WILL ACCEPT?

61
00:05:10,655 --> 00:05:13,155
- THE OFFER IS TOO GENEROUS.

62
00:05:13,188 --> 00:05:14,455
SORRY, I MUST DECLINE.

63
00:05:14,488 --> 00:05:16,755

64
00:05:20,888 --> 00:05:24,055
IT'S BEEN FAR TOO LONG, SANGO.

65
00:05:24,088 --> 00:05:25,455
- UH...

66
00:05:25,488 --> 00:05:27,222
DO I KNOW YOU?

67
00:05:29,822 --> 00:05:31,022
- LOOK CLOSER, SANGO.

68
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,388
DOESN'T HE SEEM FAMILIAR?

69
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:34,322
- HE SURE SEEMS TO KNOW YOU.

70
00:05:34,355 --> 00:05:35,288
- YEAH.

71
00:05:35,322 --> 00:05:38,022
- WELL, I CAN'T BLAME HER
FOR NOT REMEMBERING.

72

IT WAS AN AWFULLY LONG TIME AGO.

COME, LET'S RETIRE
TO THE CASTLE,

WHERE WE CAN TALK IN LEISURE

75
00:05:44,522 --> 00:05:48,222
AND BECOME REACQUAINTED
WITH ONE ANOTHER.

- HMM.

78
00:05:51,322 --> 00:05:54,055

79
00:05:55,588 --> 00:05:56,222
WOW!

80
00:05:56,255 --> 00:05:58,088

TO INTRODUCE MYSELF.

I AM KURANOSUKAI TAKETA,
LORD OF THIS CASTLE.

84
00:06:09,322 --> 00:06:10,722
- HE'S A LORD?

85
00:06:10,755 --> 00:06:13,322

86

87
00:06:14,422 --> 00:06:15,822

IT'S BEEN 6 LONG YEARS ALREADY.

93
00:06:25,255 --> 00:06:28,188
MY CASTLE HAD BEEN

YOU SHONE LIKE A SINGLE
WHITE LILY ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

99
00:06:47,055 --> 00:06:51,488
YOU WERE ABSOLUTELY
AWE-INSPIRING.

100
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,522

00:06:58,422 --> 00:07:00,355
I WILL GET TO THE POINT.

103
00:07:00,388 --> 00:07:03,288
SANGO, SLAY THE DEMON
FOR US AT ONCE,

104
00:07:03,322 --> 00:07:04,588
THEN BECOME MY WIFE.

BLAME HER FOR BEING JEALOUS

AFTER THE WAY YOU CAME
ONTO THAT OTHER WOMAN.

SEEN HIM AT IT BEFORE.

A GHOSTLY SPIRIT
SEEKING VENGEANCE.
