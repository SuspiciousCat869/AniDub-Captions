>> HI, YOURSELF.

275
00:09:35,752 --> 00:09:36,852

276
00:09:36,852 --> 00:09:38,352
>> I HEARD YOU CAUGHT A COLD, SO

277
00:09:38,352 --> 00:09:39,686
I THOUGHT I'D BETTER COME TO SEE

278
00:09:39,686 --> 00:09:40,952
HOW YOU'RE DOING.

279
00:09:40,952 --> 00:09:41,986
I'VE BEEN WONDERING WHAT I COULD

280
00:09:41,986 --> 00:09:43,686
DO FOR YOU.

281
00:09:43,686 --> 00:09:45,452
I GAVE IT A LOT OF THOUGHT, BUT

282
00:09:45,452 --> 00:09:46,619
I COULDN'T COME UP WITH MANY

283
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:49,919
IDEAS, EXCEPT THIS.

284
00:09:49,919 --> 00:09:51,452
EVERY KIND OF FRUIT I COULD LAY

285
00:09:51,452 --> 00:09:52,452
MY HANDS ON.

286
00:09:52,452 --> 00:09:53,786
ALL THIS VITAMIN C HAS GOT TO BE

287
00:09:53,786 --> 00:09:54,986
GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

288
00:09:54,986 --> 00:09:56,152
>> GEE, THANKS.

289
00:09:56,152 --> 00:09:57,419
>> AND ANOTHER THING.

290
00:09:57,419 --> 00:09:58,686
>> THESE CHARMS ARE SUPPOSED TO

291
00:09:58,686 --> 00:10:00,452
BRING YOU GOOD HEALTH.

292
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:01,386
THEN I REMEMBERED THAT YOUR

293
00:10:01,386 --> 00:10:02,886
FAMILY RUNS A SHRINE, SO YOU

294
00:10:02,886 --> 00:10:04,719
PROBABLY HAVE YOUR OWN ALREADY.

295
00:10:04,719 --> 00:10:05,686
>> THAT'S OK.

296
00:10:05,686 --> 00:10:06,819
OUR CHARMS DON'T WORK TOO WELL,

297
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:08,286
SO I'LL USE YOURS.

298
00:10:08,286 --> 00:10:09,152
>> HEY!

299
00:10:09,152 --> 00:10:11,652
>> AND THIS, A DUMBBELL.

300
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:12,486
YOU NEVER KNOW.

301
00:10:12,486 --> 00:10:13,486
IT MIGHT HELP BUILD UP

302
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:14,586
YOUR STRENGTH.

303
00:10:14,586 --> 00:10:16,019
>> BOY, YOU'RE SO CONSIDERATE.

304
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:17,752
>> ONE MORE THING.

305
00:10:17,752 --> 00:10:18,686
>> I DON'T NEED ANYTHING ELSE,

306
00:10:18,686 --> 00:10:19,519
REALLY.

307
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,486
>> WOULD YOUR FRIEND LIKE TO

308
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,052
COME IN FOR A FEW MINUTES?

309
00:10:22,052 --> 00:10:24,219
>> HUH?

310
00:10:24,219 --> 00:10:25,852
>> HUH?

311
00:10:25,852 --> 00:10:30,619
>> HUH?

312
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,319
>> WHAT ARE YOU ALL GAWKING AT?

313
00:10:32,319 --> 00:10:33,719
AND WHERE'S KAGOME?

314
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:35,319
>> WE SENT HER BACK HOME.

315
00:10:35,319 --> 00:10:36,452
>> BACK HOME?

316
00:10:36,452 --> 00:10:37,452
>> WE THOUGHT SHE'D GET BETTER

317
00:10:37,452 --> 00:10:39,386
CARE IN HER OWN HOME, SO WE SENT

318
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:41,319
HER BACK TO HER OWN TIME.

319
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:42,486
>> SHE WENT HOME?

320
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,519
AFTER ALL THE TROUBLE

321
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,719
I WENT TO?

322
00:10:44,719 --> 00:10:46,052
THAT IS THE LAST TIME THAT I--

323
00:10:46,052 --> 00:10:47,152
>> WHAT?

324
00:10:47,152 --> 00:10:48,252
HOW COME YOU TOOK OFF

325
00:10:48,252 --> 00:10:49,652
WITHOUT ME?

326
00:10:49,652 --> 00:10:51,386
>> SHIPPO, YOU--

327
00:10:51,386 --> 00:10:52,719
>> UHH!

328
00:10:52,719 --> 00:10:53,552
COME ON!

329
00:10:53,552 --> 00:10:54,752
CAN'T YOU TAKE A LITTLE JOKE?

330
00:10:54,752 --> 00:10:56,419

GET-WELL PRESENTS?

335
00:11:06,752 --> 00:11:08,186
>> NO, IT'S PROBABLY FOR US TO

IN HERE SOMEWHERE.

342
00:11:17,986 --> 00:11:19,252
WHERE IS IT?

343
00:11:19,252 --> 00:11:20,186
>> OH, HEY, GRAMPS.

344
00:11:20,186 --> 00:11:21,386
WHATCHA DOING IN THERE?
