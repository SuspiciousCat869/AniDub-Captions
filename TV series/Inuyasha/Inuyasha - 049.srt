- SO, THEY'RE AFTER THE SACRED
JEWEL SHARD, TOO, ARE THEY?

168
00:09:30,437 --> 00:09:35,004
- KOHAKU, YOU CANNOT
ESCAPE FROM ME.

169
00:09:35,037 --> 00:09:40,904
SURRENDER AND GIVE ME THE SACRED
JEWEL SHARD IN YOUR BACK.

170
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:44,670
- SACRED JEWEL SHARD?

171
00:09:44,704 --> 00:09:48,637
- SURRENDER THE JEWEL!

172
00:09:51,870 --> 00:09:53,337
- AAH!

173
00:09:55,804 --> 00:09:58,370
- [GROWLING]

174
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:00,204
- AAH!

175
00:10:00,237 --> 00:10:01,537
- KOHAKU!

176
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:03,637
- THAT DEMON IS TRYING
TO GET THE SHARD

177
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,304
EMBEDDED IN KOHAKU'S BACK!

178
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:06,204
- WHAT?

179
00:10:06,237 --> 00:10:08,704
THE SACRED SHARD EMBEDDED
IN KOHAKU'S BACK

180
00:10:08,737 --> 00:10:09,504
IS HIS LIFELINE.

181
00:10:09,537 --> 00:10:13,670
IF THE SHARD IS REMOVED,
HE'LL DIE.

182
00:10:15,837 --> 00:10:17,504
HYAH!

183
00:10:17,537 --> 00:10:20,104
- [GROWLING]

184
00:10:24,737 --> 00:10:27,404
- [GROANING]

185
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:28,870
HUH?

186
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:32,137
- KOHAKU.

187
00:10:32,170 --> 00:10:34,904
YOUR MIND WAS
UNDER NARAKU'S CONTROL,

188
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,204
AND YOU WERE IN NARAKU'S CASTLE.

189
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:40,370
SO, WHY ARE YOU HERE NOW?

190
00:10:42,604 --> 00:10:44,370
- WHO ARE YOU?

191
00:10:44,404 --> 00:10:46,170
DO YOU KNOW ME?

192
00:10:46,204 --> 00:10:48,704
- [GASP]

193
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,837
- HUH?

194
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,937
- YOU'VE HURT YOUR ARM.

195
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:59,337
LET ME SEE IT.

196
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:01,837
- UH...EXCUSE ME.

197
00:11:01,870 --> 00:11:02,637
- HMM?

198
00:11:02,670 --> 00:11:05,837
- HAVE WE, YOU KNOW,
UH, MET BEFORE?

199
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:07,737
- MM-HMM.

200
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,804
- THINK, KOHAKU.

201
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,104
ARE YOU SURE YOU DON'T
REMEMBER ANYTHING AT ALL

202
00:11:11,137 --> 00:11:13,370
FROM BEFORE YOU
ESCAPED THE CASTLE?

203
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:14,770
- HMM.

204
00:11:14,804 --> 00:11:15,704
NO.

205
00:11:15,737 --> 00:11:18,437
- YOU DON'T REMEMBER NARAKU?

206
00:11:18,470 --> 00:11:20,437
- NARAKU?

207
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,470
- KOHAKU, I HAVE NO NEED
TO KEEP YOU ALIVE ANY LONGER.

208
00:11:25,504 --> 00:11:28,670
GO JOIN YOUR FATHER
AND THE OTHERS.

209
00:11:28,704 --> 00:11:29,937
- WAIT A MINUTE.

210
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,537
COULD HE HAVE BEEN NARAKU?

211
00:11:32,570 --> 00:11:33,604
- I DON'T KNOW.

212
00:11:33,637 --> 00:11:36,404
I THINK THE KID IS JUST
PUTTING ON AN ACT FOR US.

213
00:11:36,437 --> 00:11:39,137
- IT DOESN'T APPEAR
THAT WAY TO ME.

214
00:11:39,170 --> 00:11:40,970
- YOU MEAN YOU TRUST HIM?

215
00:11:41,004 --> 00:11:42,904
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT.

216
00:11:42,937 --> 00:11:44,870
LAST TIME WE SAW KOHAKU,

217
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:48,170
HE WAS VIRTUALLY A PUPPET...

218
00:11:48,204 --> 00:11:50,870
LIKE A HUMAN WITHOUT A SOUL.

219
00:11:50,904 --> 00:11:52,304
NOW WE HAVE THIS BOY.

220
00:11:52,337 --> 00:11:53,404
- HMM?

221
00:11:53,437 --> 00:11:55,670
- DO YOU THINK IT'S SAFE TO
LEAVE THEM ALONE, KAGOME?

222
00:11:55,704 --> 00:11:57,637
- SANGO WANTED IT THAT WAY,

223
00:11:57,670 --> 00:12:00,304
SO I WASN'T GONNA
ARGUE WITH HER.

224
00:12:02,437 --> 00:12:05,137
- THE SLAYERS' VILLAGE?

225
00:12:05,170 --> 00:12:05,937
- YES.

226
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,770
THAT'S WHERE WE USED
TO LIVE, KOHAKU.

227
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:09,704
- HMM?

228
00:12:09,737 --> 00:12:11,870
THEN YOU MEAN I WAS
A DEMON SLAYER, AS WELL?

229
00:12:11,904 --> 00:12:15,504
- YOU WERE STILL AN APPRENTICE.

230
00:12:17,337 --> 00:12:18,370
- REST YOURSELF, SANGO.

231
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:21,370
WE'LL BE NEEDING YOU
AGAIN IN A SHORT TIME.

232
00:12:21,404 --> 00:12:22,304
- YES, FATHER.

233
00:12:22,337 --> 00:12:25,104
- KOHAKU, YOU, TOO,
MUST PREPARE FOR BATTLE.

234
00:12:25,137 --> 00:12:26,804
- WHO? UH, ME?

235
00:12:26,837 --> 00:12:28,170
- YES, YOU ARE 11 NOW,

236
00:12:28,204 --> 00:12:30,937
PLENTY OLD ENOUGH
TO GO INTO BATTLE.

237
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:33,437
- MM-HMM.

238
00:12:33,470 --> 00:12:36,237
- SANGO?

239
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:37,737
- YES?

240
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:42,104
- DO DEMONS BREATHE FIRE
AND TOXINS, AS THEY SAY?

241
00:12:42,137 --> 00:12:43,270
- SOMETIMES.

242
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,304
- THEN IT'S TRUE.

243
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,437
- KOHAKU, WHAT'S WRONG?

244
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,170
YOU SCARED?

245
00:12:49,204 --> 00:12:52,570
- NO, I NEVER SAID
I WAS SCARED.

246
00:12:52,604 --> 00:12:53,670
- YOU'LL BE FINE.

247
00:12:53,704 --> 00:12:56,070
WE EXTERMINATE
SNAKES AND SPIDERS

248
00:12:56,104 --> 00:12:57,704
AND OTHER SUCH LARGE BEASTS.

249
00:12:57,737 --> 00:13:00,204
AS FATHER SAYS,
THE MOST FRIGHTENING DEMON

250
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:02,804
IS ONE THAT MASQUERADES
AS A HUMAN BEING.

251
00:13:02,837 --> 00:13:05,170
HE SAYS THAT IF
THAT TYPE OF DEMON

252
00:13:05,204 --> 00:13:08,804
COMES TO POSSESS JEWEL,
THEN IT'S TROUBLE.

253
00:13:12,104 --> 00:13:14,270
THE DAY WE WERE
LURED IN BY NARAKU

254
00:13:14,304 --> 00:13:18,204
WAS KOHAKU'S VERY FIRST
EXPERIENCE IN BATTLE.

255
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:22,337
- SAY, TELL ME EVERYTHING
YOU KNOW ABOUT ME.

256
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:23,870
- UH...

257
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:25,670
- I FEEL SO EMPTY

258
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:28,004
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
HOW I GOT HERE.

259
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:31,337
- HE'S JUST LIKE
THE KOHAKU I REMEMBER--

260
00:13:31,370 --> 00:13:34,837
QUIET AND A BIT COWARDLY.

261
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:39,570
- HUH?

262
00:13:39,604 --> 00:13:40,470
- DON'T RUSH IT.

263
00:13:40,504 --> 00:13:43,404
IT'LL TAKE TIME TO REMEMBER.

264
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:49,137
WE'LL HAVE ALL THE TIME
IN THE WORLD TOGETHER NOW.

265
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:53,504
- UH...

266
00:13:53,537 --> 00:13:54,637
EXCUSE ME?

267
00:13:54,670 --> 00:13:55,370
- HMM?

268
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:57,470
- YOU'RE EMBRACING ME.

269
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:59,170
IT'S KIND OF EMBARRASSING.

270
00:13:59,204 --> 00:14:01,037
- WHY ARE YOU SO SHY?

271
00:14:01,070 --> 00:14:02,904
WE'RE SIBLINGS.

272
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,270
KOHAKU HAS COME BACK TO ME.

273
00:14:05,304 --> 00:14:07,837
HE'S ESCAPED FROM
NARAKU'S GRASP.

274
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,904
THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BELIEVE.

275
00:14:09,937 --> 00:14:11,870
- [SIGHS]

276
00:14:11,904 --> 00:14:13,370
- HUH?

277
00:14:16,204 --> 00:14:18,770
- [CLICKING]

278
00:14:20,070 --> 00:14:21,870
- WELL, I'M SURE
A COUPLE GOOD PUNCHES

279
00:14:21,904 --> 00:14:24,104
WOULD KNOCK THE TRUTH
OUT OF HIM.

280
00:14:24,137 --> 00:14:25,170
- COME ON NOW.

281
00:14:25,204 --> 00:14:26,370
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.

282
00:14:26,404 --> 00:14:27,137
- KAGOME IS RIGHT.

283
00:14:27,170 --> 00:14:28,437
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS ALL THAT.

284
00:14:28,470 --> 00:14:31,004
I CAN'T SAY WHETHER
OR NOT IT'S A TRAP,

285
00:14:31,037 --> 00:14:32,004
BUT THE FACT IS,

286
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,037
SANGO'S BEEN REUNITED
WITH HER YOUNGER BROTHER.

287
00:14:34,070 --> 00:14:36,204
- YEAH, AND IF IT IS A TRAP,

288
00:14:36,237 --> 00:14:38,037
THEN SANGO WILL
BE HEARTBROKEN.

289
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,304
- WE HAVE TO KEEP
IN MIND THAT NARAKU

290
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:42,970
LOVES TO TOY WITH
PEOPLE'S FEELINGS.

291
00:14:43,004 --> 00:14:44,437
HUH?

292
00:14:45,837 --> 00:14:47,304
- HMM!

293
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,370
- INUYASHA?

294
00:14:49,404 --> 00:14:51,004
- IF YOU TWO WON'T TELL HER,

295
00:14:51,037 --> 00:14:52,170
THEN I WILL.

296
00:14:52,204 --> 00:14:52,970
- HOLD ON!

297
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:55,337
DON'T DO IT, INUYASHA!

298
00:14:56,804 --> 00:14:58,270
- HUH?

299
00:15:02,804 --> 00:15:03,737
WHAT?

300
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:04,837
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

301
00:15:04,870 --> 00:15:08,004
- LISTEN, SANGO,
IT'S ABOUT KOHAKU.

302
00:15:08,037 --> 00:15:10,704
IT'S OBVIOUSLY ONE
OF NARAKU'S TRAPS.

303
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:11,670
- [GASPS]

304
00:15:11,704 --> 00:15:13,670
YOU'RE WRONG!
I TRUST KOHAKU.

305
00:15:13,704 --> 00:15:15,937
- THAT'S WHAT NARAKU WANTS.

306
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:16,904
- WHAT CHOICE DO I HAVE,

307
00:15:16,937 --> 00:15:18,570
EXCEPT TO TRUST
MY YOUNGER BROTHER?

308
00:15:18,604 --> 00:15:20,670
- THIS WHOLE THING
REEKS OF NARAKU.

309
00:15:20,704 --> 00:15:22,104
- IF WE HADN'T COME TO HIS AID,

310
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:24,304
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD
WOULD HAVE BEEN REMOVED,

311
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,470
AND MY BROTHER REALLY
WOULD HAVE DIED.

312
00:15:26,504 --> 00:15:27,304
- THAT'S THE TRAP.

313
00:15:27,337 --> 00:15:29,204
THAT'S WHAT HE
WANTS YOU TO THINK.

314
00:15:29,237 --> 00:15:31,437
- IT'S NOT A TRAP!

315
00:15:31,470 --> 00:15:34,837
- THAT NICE LADY
WILL BECOME UNHAPPY,

316
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:37,470
AND IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

317
00:15:37,504 --> 00:15:39,604
I CAN'T STAY.

318
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:46,170
- YOU'RE BEING BLINDED BY
LOVE FOR YOUR KID BROTHER!

319
00:15:46,204 --> 00:15:46,904
- ENOUGH!

320
00:15:46,937 --> 00:15:48,337
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I FEEL!

321
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:50,204
- OPEN YOUR EYES!

322
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:52,137
- FAREWELL, THEN.

323
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,104
- LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING--

324
00:15:54,137 --> 00:15:55,904
- HMM?
- HUH?

325
00:15:55,937 --> 00:15:56,837
- [RUMBLING]

326
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,237
- THEY'RE COMING.

327
00:15:59,270 --> 00:16:01,470
- HUNDREDS OF THEM.

328
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:13,937
- [BUZZING]

329
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,637
