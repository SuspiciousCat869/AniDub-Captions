1
00:01:33,147 --> 00:01:34,181
- MMM. THAT HITS THE SPOT.

2
00:01:34,214 --> 00:01:37,447
- KAGOME, ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE BACK TO NORMAL ALREADY?

3
00:01:37,481 --> 00:01:38,114
- YES.

4
00:01:38,147 --> 00:01:39,081
FOR THE TENTH TIME TODAY,

5
00:01:39,114 --> 00:01:40,447
I FEEL PERFECTLY FINE AGAIN.

6
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:43,781
I CAN HARDLY BELIEVE
THE OLD DEMON MANAGED
TO SUCK MY SOUL OUT OF ME,

7
00:01:43,814 --> 00:01:45,447
BUT I'M BACK
TO MY OLD SELF NOW.

8
00:01:45,481 --> 00:01:48,581
- I WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME
FOR INUYASHA, THOUGH.

9
00:01:48,614 --> 00:01:49,747
SINCE HIS RUN-IN WITH KIKYO,

10
00:01:49,781 --> 00:01:54,081
HE'S BEEN SPENDING
A LOT OF TIME
JUST STARING INTO SPACE.

11
00:01:54,114 --> 00:01:55,647
- I JUST DON'T KNOW ANYMORE.

12
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,847
SO I GATHER UP ALL THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL

13
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:00,981
TO BECOME A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON,

14
00:02:01,014 --> 00:02:01,847
AND THEN WHAT?

15
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:04,681
EVEN IF I DO
FULLY BECOME A DEMON,

16
00:02:04,714 --> 00:02:06,814
WILL THAT MAKE ME
STRONGER INSIDE?

17
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:10,714
CAN I EVER TRULY FORGET KIKYO?

18
00:02:13,947 --> 00:02:14,781
- LOOK AT HIM.

19
00:02:14,814 --> 00:02:17,281
I'VE NEVER SEEN HIM
ACT THIS WAY BEFORE.

20
00:02:17,314 --> 00:02:18,947
- NO. NEITHER HAVE I.

21
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:21,781
- TAKE THAT!

22
00:02:21,814 --> 00:02:22,681
- BAD MOVE.

23
00:02:22,714 --> 00:02:24,214
- WHAT'D YOU DO THAT FOR,
SHRIMP?

24
00:02:24,247 --> 00:02:25,414
- TO KNOCK SOME SENSE
INTO YOU.

25
00:02:25,447 --> 00:02:27,847
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE LOOKING
FOR THE JEWEL SHARDS.

26
00:02:27,881 --> 00:02:29,047
- GET OFF MY BACK.

27
00:02:29,081 --> 00:02:31,847
EVEN A GUY LIKE ME
NEEDS SOME TIME TO THINK
ONCE IN AWHILE.

28
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:33,647
- YEAH, THAT'S
WHAT'S WORRYING ME.

29
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:34,947
- WORRY ABOUT THIS!

30
00:02:34,981 --> 00:02:36,481
COME BACK HERE,
YOU LITTLE PIPSQUEAK!

31
00:02:36,514 --> 00:02:37,781
- CAN'T CATCH ME,
CAN YOU, BIG OAF?

32
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:38,714
- NOW YOU'VE DONE IT.

33
00:02:38,747 --> 00:02:40,514
- THE SHIKON JEWEL
IS ENSHROUDED

34
00:02:40,547 --> 00:02:41,414
WITH SUCH MISERY.

35
00:02:41,447 --> 00:02:43,547
KIKYO CLAIMS THAT
INUYASHA BETRAYED HER,

36
00:02:43,581 --> 00:02:45,914
AND INUYASHA SAYS THAT IT WAS
THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

37
00:02:45,947 --> 00:02:49,381
HOW COULD TWO VERSIONS
OF THE SAME STORY
BE SO DIFFERENT?

38
00:02:49,414 --> 00:02:51,181
I ONLY HOPE THAT
THE PUZZLE WILL BE SOLVED

39
00:02:51,214 --> 00:02:54,714
ONCE WE'VE FOUND
ALL THE SHARDS OF THE JEWEL.

40
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,747
- SO I SHOULD GO RIGHT.

41
00:03:06,781 --> 00:03:07,914
- HAVE YOU HEARD ABOUT
THE NEW WOMAN

42
00:03:07,947 --> 00:03:10,947
WORKING AT THE REST HOUSE
UP AHEAD?

43
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:11,914
THEY SAY HER FAIR COMPLEXION

44
00:03:11,947 --> 00:03:13,281
AND BEAUTIFUL EYES
ARE UNPARALLELED,

45
00:03:13,314 --> 00:03:16,047
AND I UNDERSTAND
SHE'S UNATTACHED.

46
00:03:16,081 --> 00:03:18,114
- I COULD USE
A BITE TO EAT.

47
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,647
- JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING.

48
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,114
- DIVINE INTERVENTION.

49
00:03:25,147 --> 00:03:26,681
- SURELY THEY CAN'T BE
SPEAKING OF

50
00:03:26,714 --> 00:03:29,514
THE SAME YOUNG WOMAN
I RECALL.

51
00:03:29,547 --> 00:03:31,814
- YOUR SWEETS ARE READY.

52
00:03:33,047 --> 00:03:34,147
- UH, THANKS.

53

TO THE RIGHT.

54
00:03:36,814 --> 00:03:37,847
- JUST BETWEEN US,

55
00:03:37,881 --> 00:03:39,281
I UNDERSTAND THE DAUGHTER
OF THE LORD IN THIS REGION

56
00:03:39,314 --> 00:03:43,181
HAS BEEN POSSESSED BY
SOME SORT OF EVIL SPIRIT
AND HAS TAKEN TO HER BED.

57
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:46,814
- HE'LL REQUIRE THE AID
OF A SKILLED PRIEST, THEN.

58
00:03:50,047 --> 00:03:53,781
- ARE YOU CERTAIN
THIS MONK IS VIRTUOUS
AND TRUSTWORTHY?

59
00:03:53,814 --> 00:03:55,414
- IF ONE IS TO BELIEVE
HIS CLAIMS,

60
00:03:55,447 --> 00:03:56,447
THEN, AYE, MY LORD.

61
00:03:56,481 --> 00:03:58,747
- MONK, YOU MUST DRIVE AWAY

00:04:01,181 --> 00:04:02,347
OR YOU'LL RECEIVE NOTHING.

IN SUCH TURBULENT TIMES
AS THESE.

SURELY YOUR VASSALS
MUST RESENT YOUR WEALTH.

66

- IMPUDENCE!

67
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:15,247
PRINCESS, A MONK HAS COME
TO OFFER HIS BLESSINGS.

68
00:04:19,181 --> 00:04:20,347
- PARDON ME.

69
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,181
ALLOW ME TO SEE HER.

70
00:04:22,214 --> 00:04:24,547
HER FACE IS TERRIBLY SWOLLEN.

72

ARE YOU CERTAIN
YOU'RE TRULY A MONK?

73
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:30,747

74
00:04:34,614 --> 00:04:36,014
TELL ME ABOUT THAT STATUE.

75
00:04:36,047 --> 00:04:38,781

FROM AN IMPOVERISHED NOBLEMAN.

THEY SAY IT IS
A BLESSED IDOL.

77

I AM PREPARED TO BEGIN.

79

LEAVE THE PRINCESS
HERE WITH ME

80

ON THE GROUNDS

YOU WOULD NOT GIVE IN EASILY.

94
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:43,014
A SHARD OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

95
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:52,114
- THE BEAST SOUNDS
FEARSOME INDEED.

96
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,747
- IT CERTAINLY DOES.

97
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:56,814

A LOOK INSIDE, MILORD.

BESIDES, I WANT TO MAKE SURE
THE DEMON IS LONG GONE.

101
00:06:06,114 --> 00:06:07,914

AN EXORCISM

WAS THE CULPRIT.

TURNED INTO A DEMON

THAT YOUNG MONK?

SHOO, MONKEYS!

- SHE'S WITH ANOTHER MAN.

162
00:08:34,647 --> 00:08:35,414
TOO BAD.

163
00:08:35,447 --> 00:08:38,314
I HATE HAVING
TO RESORT TO VIOLENCE.

164

I MERELY WISH
FOR A GUARANTEE.

- COME ON,
CAN'T YOU TRY AND SEE
THE HUMOR IN IT?

169
00:08:50,981 --> 00:08:52,081
SO I BONKED YOU ON THE HEAD.

170

SOMEWHERE ELSE.

YOU WANT ME TO ATTACK?

176
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:07,814
- RIGHT.

I SHALL MAKE OFF
WITH THE GIRL.

178

- I STILL DON'T GET IT.

179

WHY GO TO ALL THIS TROUBLE

YOUR POWERFUL RIGHT HAND

BETTER THAN THAT.

GET OUT OF CONTROL.

YOU HAVE NO REASON
TO DOUBT MY INTENTIONS.

AND GOT HIMSELF A YOUNG WOMAN
IN THE PROCESS.

WITH HIS RIGHT HAND?

00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:09,514
OR THE YOUNG FOX?

319
00:14:09,547 --> 00:14:12,647
- UH, HE CAN'T BE ALL BAD
IF HE HAS SUCH GOOD TASTE.

320
00:14:12,681 --> 00:14:13,647
- SNAP OUT OF IT, KAGOME.

321
00:14:13,681 --> 00:14:16,447
HE STOLE YOUR JEWEL
FROM UNDER YOUR NOSE.

322
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:17,847
- ENOUGH TALKING.

323
00:14:17,881 --> 00:14:19,647
LET ME AT YOU!

324
00:14:23,681 --> 00:14:26,881
- STRONG,
BUT NOT STRONG ENOUGH.

325
00:14:26,914 --> 00:14:27,681
- CURSE HIM!

326
00:14:27,714 --> 00:14:29,814
HE BLOCKS EVERY STRIKE.

327
00:14:40,147 --> 00:14:42,814
I'LL HAVE THAT JEWEL SHARD
BACK FROM YOU NOW,

328
00:14:42,847 --> 00:14:45,147
UNLESS YOU'D RATHER DIE,
THAT IS.

329
00:14:45,181 --> 00:14:48,514
- HMM.

330
00:14:48,547 --> 00:14:50,047
- AS YOU WISH.

331
00:14:50,081 --> 00:14:51,047
VILLAGERS, TAKE HEED!

332
00:14:51,081 --> 00:14:53,481
DISTANCE YOURSELF
FROM THIS PLACE,
I WARN YOU.

333
00:14:53,514 --> 00:14:55,381
IT'S FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY.

334
00:14:55,414 --> 00:14:56,647
[MURMURING]

335
00:14:56,681 --> 00:14:58,147
- HUH?

336
00:15:03,914 --> 00:15:04,747
- END OF THE LINE.

337
00:15:04,781 --> 00:15:07,747
THIS TIME VICTORY IS MINE.

338
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:08,414
- HMM.

339
00:15:08,447 --> 00:15:10,047
- HE'S HOLDING OUT
HIS HAND.

340
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:12,747
- THIS MAY COME
AS SOMETHING OF A SURPRISE,

341
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:16,314
BUT I'M A VERY SORE LOSER.

342
00:15:16,347 --> 00:15:18,914
WIND TUNNEL!

343
00:15:25,581 --> 00:15:26,947
- IT'S JUST LIKE
BACK AT THE CLIFF.

344
00:15:26,981 --> 00:15:29,414
WHERE'S THE
WIND COMING FROM?

345
00:15:31,481 --> 00:15:33,081
HIS RIGHT HAND'S
DRAWING IT IN.

346
00:15:33,114 --> 00:15:36,914
- LET'S SEE HOW LONG
YOU CAN WITHSTAND ME.

347
00:15:39,681 --> 00:15:40,714
- RUN AWAY!

348
00:15:40,747 --> 00:15:42,681
QUICKLY!

349
00:15:42,714 --> 00:15:44,447
- HIS HAND'S JUST LIKE
A BLACK HOLE.

350
00:15:44,481 --> 00:15:48,247
IT'S SUCKING UP EVERYTHING
THAT ISN'T NAILED DOWN.

351
00:15:48,847 --> 00:15:51,314
- WE'D BETTER
ESCAPE FROM HERE
WHILE WE CAN.

352
00:15:51,347 --> 00:15:53,247
- WE HAVE TO STOP HIM.

353
00:15:53,281 --> 00:15:54,014
- HUH?

354
00:15:54,047 --> 00:15:55,614
- HOW DO WE DO THAT?

355
00:15:55,647 --> 00:15:56,881
- VILLAGERS, TAKE HEED!

356
00:15:56,914 --> 00:15:58,281
DISTANCE YOURSELF
FROM THIS PLACE.

357
00:15:58,314 --> 00:16:03,347
- HE WARNED THE VILLAGERS
BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
TO HURT HUMANS.

358
00:16:03,381 --> 00:16:04,181
- CAN'T LET GO.

359
00:16:04,214 --> 00:16:05,214
- SURRENDER WHILE YOU CAN.

360
00:16:05,247 --> 00:16:08,747
IF YOU GET SUCKED IN,
YOU'LL NEVER COME OUT ALIVE.

361
00:16:08,781 --> 00:16:10,014
- NO CHANCE.

362
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:13,514
I'LL BE TOO BUSY
HACKING YOUR RIGHT HAND OFF
TO SURRENDER.

363
00:16:13,547 --> 00:16:17,681
- MY HAND WILL PULL YOU IN,
SWORD AND ALL.

364
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:20,681
- KAGOME!

365
00:16:25,514 --> 00:16:27,347
KAGOME!

366
00:16:42,798 --> 00:16:45,765
- OH, MY HEAD.

367
00:16:45,798 --> 00:16:47,231
HUH?

368
00:16:48,331 --> 00:16:49,365
- THOSE PRAYER BEADS.

369
00:16:49,398 --> 00:16:52,198
THEY'RE WHAT SEALS OFF
THE POWER OF HIS HAND.

370
00:16:52,231 --> 00:16:54,198
HE STOPPED THE ASSAULT
ON HIS OWN,

371
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:57,565
MEANING HE CAN'T BE
ALL THAT BAD.

372
00:16:59,798 --> 00:17:01,165
- KAGOME, ARE YOU CRAZY?

373
00:17:01,198 --> 00:17:02,298
YOU COULD'VE GOTTEN
YOURSELF KILLED.

374
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:04,831
- I WOULDN'T HAVE DONE IT
IF I'D HAD ANY DOUBTS.

375
00:17:04,865 --> 00:17:06,031
WITH A HAND THAT POWERFUL,

376
00:17:06,065 --> 00:17:08,665
HE COULD HAVE KILLED US
A LONG TIME AGO
IF HE'D WANTED TO.

377
00:17:08,698 --> 00:17:11,131
LET'S AT LEAST
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

378
00:17:11,165 --> 00:17:13,331
MAYBE HE CAN LEND US A HAND.

379
00:17:16,398 --> 00:17:17,431
- I WAS WRONG.

380
00:17:17,465 --> 00:17:18,198
KILL HIM!

381
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:19,531
- YOU JUST BLEW
YOUR LAST CHANCE.

382
00:17:19,565 --> 00:17:20,898
- SETTLE DOWN, WILL YOU?

383
00:17:20,931 --> 00:17:22,031
LET ME EXPLAIN THINGS.

384
00:17:22,065 --> 00:17:25,098
I, TOO,
AM IN SEARCH OF THE SHARDS
OF THE SHIKON JEWEL.

385
00:17:25,131 --> 00:17:27,898
MY PURPOSE IS TO FIND
AND ELIMINATE A DEMON--

386
00:17:27,931 --> 00:17:31,931
A TERRIBLE DEMON
THAT GOES BY THE NAME OF NARAKU.

387
00:17:31,965 --> 00:17:33,465
- NARAKU?

388
00:17:33,498 --> 00:17:34,931
- YES, AND IT WAS
THIS SAME DEMON

389
00:17:34,965 --> 00:17:37,631
WHO LEFT ME
WITH THIS CURSED HOLE
IN MY RIGHT HAND.

390
00:17:37,665 --> 00:17:40,331
- WHAT SORT OF DEMON
IS THIS THING?

391
00:17:40,365 --> 00:17:43,598
- I KNOW LITTLE OF HIM
EXCEPT THAT HE IS VERY WICKED

392
00:17:43,631 --> 00:17:45,698
AND THOUGHT TO DEVOUR PEOPLE.

393
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,231
- YEAH, GO ON.

394
00:17:47,265 --> 00:17:48,931
- ACCORDING TO FATHER,

395
00:17:48,965 --> 00:17:52,998
MY GRANDFATHER
BATTLED NARAKU LONG AGO
IN HIS YOUTH.

396
00:17:53,031 --> 00:17:54,898
IT WAS OVER 50 YEARS AGO.

397
00:17:54,931 --> 00:17:56,498
THEIR BATTLE ENSUED
FOR SEVERAL YEARS,

398
00:17:56,531 --> 00:17:59,665
AND EACH TIME NARAKU
APPEARED BEFORE MY GRANDFATHER,

399
00:17:59,698 --> 00:18:03,331
HE TOOK ON THE FORM
OF A DIFFERENT HUMAN.

400
00:18:04,231 --> 00:18:06,165
- HE WAS A SHAPE-SHIFTER,
SERIOUSLY?

401
00:18:06,198 --> 00:18:08,931
- THEY SAY THAT
THE LAST TIME HE APPEARED
BEFORE MY GRANDFATHER,

402
00:18:08,965 --> 00:18:11,765
HE TOOK ON THE FORM
OF A BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.

403
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:14,265
MY GRANDFATHER
HAD GREAT SPIRITUAL POWERS,

404
00:18:14,298 --> 00:18:18,098
BUT UNFORTUNATELY,
AS FATE WOULD HAVE IT...

405
00:18:18,131 --> 00:18:19,098
- DON'T TELL ME.

406
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:19,965
HE WAS A LECHER.

407
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:22,098
- REMARKABLE INTUITION.

408
00:18:25,765 --> 00:18:28,098
- NARAKU PIERCED
MY GRANDFATHER'S RIGHT HAND

409
00:18:28,131 --> 00:18:29,998
WITH HIS SACRED
RELIGIOUS SEALS

410
00:18:30,031 --> 00:18:32,031
AND MANAGED TO ESCAPE.

411
00:18:32,065 --> 00:18:34,165
- THE ABYSSAL HOLE
THAT I HAVE CURSED YOU WITH

412
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,165
SHALL BE PASSED DOWN
TO YOUR CHILDREN,

413
00:18:36,198 --> 00:18:38,098
AND THEIR CHILDREN,
SO LONG AS I LIVE.

414
00:18:38,131 --> 00:18:44,431
EACH GENERATION
SHALL THUS BE CURSED
UNTIL NO ONE REMAINS.

415
00:18:45,331 --> 00:18:48,098
- EACH YEAR,
THE HOLE IN MY HAND
BECOMES BIGGER

416
00:18:48,131 --> 00:18:50,398
AND THE WIND
EVER MORE POWERFUL.

417
00:18:50,431 --> 00:18:51,831
UNLESS I CAN DEFEAT NARAKU,

418
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,665
I MYSELF WILL EVENTUALLY
BE DEVOURED BY THE HOLE.

419
00:18:54,698 --> 00:18:57,731
- SO IN OTHER WORDS,
YOU MEAN IT WOULD KILL YOU?

420
00:18:57,765 --> 00:19:01,065
- YES, AND I AM PREPARED
TO ACCEPT THAT FATE

421
00:19:01,098 --> 00:19:02,598
IF SUCH IS TRULY MY DESTINY.

422
00:19:02,631 --> 00:19:07,431
BUT IN THE MEANTIME,
I MUST CONTINUE TRYING
TO STOP NARAKU.

423
00:19:07,698 --> 00:19:11,165
THE SACRED JEWEL OF THE 4 SOULS
VANISHED 50 YEARS AGO

424
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:14,365
AND NOW ITS SCATTERED
INTO MANY TINY SHARDS.

425
00:19:14,398 --> 00:19:15,398
KNOWING NARAKU,

426
00:19:15,431 --> 00:19:17,298
HE IS CERTAIN
TO ATTEMPT TO GATHER
THE FRAGMENTS

427
00:19:17,331 --> 00:19:20,031
IN ORDER TO STRENGTHEN
HIS OWN MALICIOUS POWER.

428
00:19:20,065 --> 00:19:20,831
I'M SURE OF IT.

429
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,998
I KNOW BECAUSE
NARAKU ONCE CAME CLOSE

430
00:19:23,031 --> 00:19:24,698
TO GETTING THE JEWEL
50 YEARS AGO.

431
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:29,031
IN DOING SO,
HE SLEW THE PRIESTESS
PROTECTING IT.

432
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:31,198
- YOU SAY HE KILLED
A PRIESTESS?

433
00:19:31,231 --> 00:19:32,098
- THAT'S RIGHT.

434
00:19:32,131 --> 00:19:33,131
- HE MUST BE THE DEMON

435
00:19:33,165 --> 00:19:36,365
WHO DISGUISED HIMSELF AS ME
AND STRUCK DOWN KIKYO!

436
00:19:36,398 --> 00:19:38,331
IT MUST BE HIM!

437
00:19:38,365 --> 00:19:40,498
MIROKU, YOU SAY THIS NARAKU

438
00:19:40,531 --> 00:19:43,198
TAKES ON ALL KINDS
OF DIFFERENT FORMS, RIGHT?

439
00:19:43,231 --> 00:19:44,165
WHAT ABOUT NOW?

440
00:19:44,198 --> 00:19:46,598
WHAT DOES HE LOOK LIKE NOW?

441
00:19:46,631 --> 00:19:47,365
- CALM DOWN.

442
00:19:47,398 --> 00:19:48,431
IF I HAD THAT INFORMATION,

443
00:19:48,465 --> 00:19:51,865
I WOULD HAVE SLAIN HIM
LONG AGO MYSELF.

444
00:19:53,965 --> 00:19:56,531
- NARAKU LAID A TRAP
FOR KIKYO AND ME.

445
00:19:56,565 --> 00:19:58,898
HE MADE US BELIEVE
WE DECEIVED EACH OTHER.

446
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,398
THE DEMON WHO KILLED KIKYO
IS STILL ALIVE

447
00:20:01,431 --> 00:20:03,898
AND IS AFTER
THE SACRED JEWEL FRAGMENTS.

448
00:20:03,931 --> 00:20:06,598
I WILL HUNT DOWN
KIKYO'S KILLER

449
00:20:06,631 --> 00:20:09,031
AND AVENGE HER DEATH.

450
00:20:11,498 --> 00:20:13,765
- IF WE KEEP LOOKING
FOR THESE JEWEL FRAGMENTS,

451
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:17,165
WE'RE SURE TO RUN INTO
NARAKU OURSELVES
SOONER OR LATER.

452
00:20:17,198 --> 00:20:18,498
- HOW DID YOU GET THAT BACK?

453
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:21,165
- LET'S SEARCH
FOR THE JEWEL SHARDS TOGETHER.

454
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:22,065
- UH...

455
00:20:22,098 --> 00:20:24,931
- UNLESS YOU PLAN
ON GIVING UP, INUYASHA.

456
00:20:24,965 --> 00:20:26,665
- I'M NEVER GIVING UP.

457
00:20:26,698 --> 00:20:28,865
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

458
00:20:30,065 --> 00:20:32,098
- I'VE ALWAYS BEEN MORE
OF A SOLITARY MAN,

459
00:20:32,131 --> 00:20:35,531
PREFERRING TO WORK ON MY OWN
THAN IN THE COMPANY OF OTHERS.

460
00:20:35,565 --> 00:20:36,965
- YEAH, BUT IF
WE DON'T ACT FAST,

461
00:20:36,998 --> 00:20:40,065
YOU WON'T EVEN HAVE
YOUR OWN COMPANY TO ENJOY.

462
00:20:40,098 --> 00:20:41,298
- DEAR KAGOME,

463
00:20:41,331 --> 00:20:44,631
ARE YOU TROUBLE BY
THIS WRETCHED FATE OF MINE?

464
00:20:44,665 --> 00:20:45,765
- SORT OF.

465
00:20:45,798 --> 00:20:47,865
- THEN DO ME THIS GOOD TURN,
WILL YOU?

466
00:20:47,898 --> 00:20:50,831
I WISH FOR YOU
TO BEAR ME A SON.

467
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:51,865
- HEKE?

468
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:53,365
- HUH?

469
00:20:53,398 --> 00:20:54,665
- AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?

470
00:20:54,698 --> 00:20:56,698
- IF FOR SOME
UNFORESEEABLE REASON

471
00:20:56,731 --> 00:20:58,498
I SHOULD FAIL
TO DESTROY NARAKU,

472
00:20:58,531 --> 00:21:02,831
I SHOULD LIKE MY SON TO CARRY ON
THE FAMILY'S MISSION.

473

[SIGHS]

474
00:21:03,665 --> 00:21:04,431
- HANDS OFF, PRIEST.

475
00:21:04,465 --> 00:21:06,431
YOUR ONLY FAMILY MISSION
IS LECHERY.

476
00:21:06,465 --> 00:21:07,498
- I'M A MONK, NOT A PRIEST.

477
00:21:07,531 --> 00:21:11,698
- DON'T EVER CONSIDER
LAYING A HAND ON KAGOME AGAIN.

478
00:21:11,731 --> 00:21:12,831
- INUYASHA?

479
00:21:12,865 --> 00:21:14,331
- OH, I BEG YOUR PARDON.

480
00:21:14,365 --> 00:21:16,798
I THOUGHT YOU NO MORE
THAN A COMPANION.

481
00:21:16,831 --> 00:21:19,598
BUT APPARENTLY
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH KAGOME.

482
00:21:19,631 --> 00:21:21,365
- UH...

483
00:21:21,398 --> 00:21:24,131
- MY, THIS IS AWKWARD.

484
00:21:24,898 --> 00:21:26,598
- WELL, YOU'VE GOT IT ALL WRONG.

485
00:21:26,631 --> 00:21:29,131
SHE'S JUST A JEWEL DETECTOR.

486
00:21:29,165 --> 00:21:29,831
- HUH?

487
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,165
IS THAT ALL I AM TO YOU?

488
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:33,031
OH, HOW COULD I FORGET,

489
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:35,631
YOU GOT A THING FOR DEAD GIRLS.

490
00:21:35,665 --> 00:21:36,665
- HUH?

491
00:21:36,698 --> 00:21:37,931
- WHO SHOULD I HELP OUT?

492
00:21:37,965 --> 00:21:40,165
MIROKU'S A LOT NICER
THAN INUYASHA.

493
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:41,898
- YOU WOULDN'T DARE
BETRAY ME!

494
00:21:41,931 --> 00:21:43,131
- YOU CAN'T REALLY BLAME HER.

495
00:21:43,165 --> 00:21:44,831
YOU COULD TREAT HER
MORE KINDLY.

496
00:21:44,865 --> 00:21:46,065
- HA! WHAT DO YOU KNOW?

497
00:21:46,098 --> 00:21:49,665
- WELL, SO MUCH
FOR EVERYONE COMING
TO A PEACEFUL SOLUTION.

498
00:21:49,698 --> 00:21:51,465
I NEVER WANT TO GROW UP.

499
00:21:51,498 --> 00:21:52,631
- YES! EXACTLY!

500
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:53,865
BE MORE GENTLE!

501
00:21:53,898 --> 00:21:54,531
- LIKE THIS.

502
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:55,831
- AAH!
GET YOUR HANDS OFF ME!

503
00:21:55,865 --> 00:21:58,631
- I TOLD YOU
NOT TO TOUCH HER!

[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

505
00:23:38,339 --> 00:23:40,472
- WE NOW KNOW THAT NARAKU
WAS THE DEMON

506
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:43,739
WHO CAUSED INUYASHA
AND KIKYO TO HATE EACH OTHER.

507
00:23:43,772 --> 00:23:45,106
WHILE TRAVELING WITH MIROKU,

508
00:23:45,139 --> 00:23:48,206
WE DISCOVERED THE SCENT OF INK
ON AN OLD BATTLEFIELD.

509
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:51,172
WE FOLLOWED THE SCENT
TO A MYSTERIOUS ARTIST,

510
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:52,106
AND BEFORE WE KNOW IT,

511
00:23:52,139 --> 00:23:55,406
DEMONS ESCAPE FROM THE DRAWING
AND ATTACK US.

512
00:23:55,439 --> 00:23:58,439
WHY HAS THE DRAWING
COME TO LIFE?

513
00:23:59,372 --> 00:24:01,439
NEXT TIME...

514
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:03,839
SEE YOU SOON!
