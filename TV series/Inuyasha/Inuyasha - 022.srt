1
00:01:28,635 --> 00:01:31,002
- A SPIDER ON HIS BACK?

2
00:01:31,035 --> 00:01:35,135
- YES, INUYASHA SAID HE SAW
A SPIDER-SHAPED BURN MARK

3
00:01:35,168 --> 00:01:36,568
IN THE MIDDLE OF
MIROKU'S BACK.

4
00:01:36,602 --> 00:01:40,902
- THE THIEF ONIGUMO
SUFFERED FROM TERRIBLE BURNS.

5
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:43,968
PERHAPS THAT MEANS
THAT MIROKU IS ONIGUMO.

6
00:01:44,002 --> 00:01:51,068
- A SPIDER ON HIS BACK.
THAT SHALL SERVE AS
MIROKU'S OWN SIGN.

7
00:02:02,568 --> 00:02:05,868
- KIKYO DIDN'T USE
THE POWER OF THE SHIKON JEWEL

8
00:02:05,902 --> 00:02:08,102
TO SAVE HERSELF.

9
00:02:09,902 --> 00:02:11,968
- KIKYO CHOSE DEATH
OVER LIFE.

10
00:02:12,002 --> 00:02:15,202
SHE CHOSE TO FOLLOW INUYASHA.

11
00:02:35,002 --> 00:02:36,802
- THIS MANSION IS ENORMOUS!

12
00:02:36,835 --> 00:02:37,968
WHAT DO YOU THINK MIROKU?

13
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:39,502
WILL WE BE STAYING
HERE FOR THE NIGHT?

14
00:02:39,535 --> 00:02:44,935
- I'LL WAGER MIROKU TELLS
THE OWNERS AN OMINOUS CLOUD
HANGS OVER THE MANSION.

15
00:02:44,968 --> 00:02:45,868
- YOU'RE MISTAKEN.

16
00:02:45,902 --> 00:02:49,368
I HAVE A LEGITIMATE
REASON FOR COMING HERE.

17
00:02:49,768 --> 00:02:53,902
- SO THESE DEMONS CARRY OFF
THE SOULS OF DEAD GIRLS?

18
00:02:53,935 --> 00:02:56,735
- YES, AS IF LOSING OUR PRINCESS
WASN'T UPSETTING ENOUGH.

19
00:02:56,768 --> 00:03:01,968
I CANNOT HAVE HER SOUL
STOLEN BEFORE IT REACHES
ITS FINAL RESTING PLACE.

20
00:03:02,002 --> 00:03:03,668
- NO SUCH THING WILL OCCUR.

21
00:03:03,702 --> 00:03:04,935
REST ASSURED THAT
MY ASSOCIATES AND I

22
00:03:04,968 --> 00:03:07,802
SHALL PROTECT THE PRINCESSES
SOUL FROM THESE DEMONS.

23
00:03:07,835 --> 00:03:09,635
- HMM?

24
00:03:13,102 --> 00:03:16,202
- WHAT'D I TELL YOU?
SAME OLD LINE, SAME
OLD UNWARRANTED FEAST.

25
00:03:16,235 --> 00:03:22,335
- PERHAPS, BUT ONE NEEDS
A FULL STOMACH IF HE IS
TO HEAD INTO COMBAT.

26
00:03:22,368 --> 00:03:24,135
THIS PLACE IS TOO QUIET.

27
00:03:24,168 --> 00:03:26,468
THE AIR IS THICK WITH EVIL.

28
00:03:28,035 --> 00:03:30,302
- [LAUGHING]

29
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:31,935
- [HUMMING]

30
00:03:31,968 --> 00:03:33,968
AHH! OH, I FOUND SOME.

31
00:03:34,002 --> 00:03:37,335
KIKYO!
KIKYO, I FOUND SOME!

32
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:47,002
LOOK, IS THIS A MEDICINAL HERB?

33
00:03:47,035 --> 00:03:48,668
- YES, WELL DONE, SAYO.

34
00:03:48,702 --> 00:03:50,135
IT'S CALLED A LANTERN PLANT,

35
00:03:50,168 --> 00:03:51,568
AND IT'S USED
TO REDUCE SWELLING.

36
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:53,635
- KIKYO! KIKYO!
HEY, WHAT ARE THESE?

37
00:03:53,668 --> 00:03:56,335
- DO THESE
GRASSES CURE ANYTHING?

38
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:58,935
- LET'S SEE.

39
00:03:58,968 --> 00:04:04,735
- MASTER SEIKAI,
ARE YOU CERTAIN THAT THE
YOUNG PRIESTESS IS A DEMON?

40
00:04:04,768 --> 00:04:07,702
SHE LOOKS NOTHING MORE
THAN A HUMAN TO MY EYES.

41
00:04:07,735 --> 00:04:10,202
- THEN YOU LACK IN TRAINING.

42
00:04:10,235 --> 00:04:11,268
CAN YOU NOT SENSE IT?

43
00:04:11,302 --> 00:04:15,835
THIS AREA RESONATES
WITH A SINISTER EVIL.

44
00:04:15,868 --> 00:04:17,735
- EXCUSE ME, MONK?

45
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:18,735
- HUH?

46
00:04:18,768 --> 00:04:19,802
- HUH?

47
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,568
- I SEE YOU HAVE BEEN
WATCHING ME FOR SOME TIME NOW.

48
00:04:24,102 --> 00:04:27,768
- HOW VERY AWKWARD.
YOU PERCEIVED US, DID YOU?

49
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:29,635
YOUR BEAUTY IS SO REMARKABLE,

50
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:31,635
I COULD NOT HELP
BUT STARE AT YOU.

51
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,768
- SPARE ME YOUR FLATTERY.

52
00:04:32,802 --> 00:04:37,368
- APPARENTLY MY ETIQUETTE
IS IN SORE NEED OF REFINEMENT.

53
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,835
OHH!

54
00:04:45,235 --> 00:04:46,135
- HMMM.

55
00:04:46,168 --> 00:04:48,502
- GATHER THE SCROLL
FOR ME, WILL YOU?

56
00:04:48,535 --> 00:04:51,602
IT CONTAINS
A SUTRA WARDING OFF EVIL.

57
00:04:51,635 --> 00:04:57,435
SHOULD A DEMON TOUCH IT,
THE BEAST'S TRUE NATURE
WILL BE REVEALED.

58
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:06,502
- HOW FORTUNATE WE HAVE
SUCH SUTRAS TO PROTECT US.

59
00:05:06,535 --> 00:05:08,602
HERE.
YOUR SCROLL.

60
00:05:11,402 --> 00:05:12,668
- [GASP]

61
00:05:12,702 --> 00:05:14,835
SHE TOUCHED THE SUTRA.

62
00:05:14,868 --> 00:05:18,802
YET, THERE WAS
NO TRANSFORMATION.

63
00:05:18,835 --> 00:05:20,668
AAHHHH!

64
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:34,002
- NOW, LET US GO, SHALL WE?

65
00:05:49,235 --> 00:05:52,002
- I-I'M NOT
CERTAIN WHAT TRANSPIRED.

66
00:05:52,035 --> 00:05:56,068
A TREMENDOUS FORCE
DID PASS THROUGH MY BODY.

67
00:05:56,102 --> 00:05:57,435
NO, IT'S GONE!

68
00:05:57,468 --> 00:06:00,135
- WHAT IS IT?
WHAT UPSETS YOU, MASTER SEIKAI?

69
00:06:00,168 --> 00:06:03,068
- LOOK AT THE SCROLL.

70
00:06:03,102 --> 00:06:04,502
- HUH?

71
00:06:04,535 --> 00:06:06,302
THE SUTRA HAS DISAPPEARED.

72
00:06:06,335 --> 00:06:08,802
- IT'S AS THOUGH
IT HAS BEEN ERASED.

73
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:09,835
- HUH?

74
00:06:09,868 --> 00:06:11,768
- PRIESTESS!

75
00:06:15,835 --> 00:06:18,235
I DO NOT KNOW
WHAT BINDS YOU TO THIS WORLD,

76
00:06:18,268 --> 00:06:21,102
BUT IT IS CERTAINLY NOT
A PLACE FOR YOU TO LINGER.

77
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:24,135
GO, AND RETURN
TO WHERE YOU BELONG!

78
00:06:24,168 --> 00:06:25,835
- WHAT'S HE GOIN' ON ABOUT?

79
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:27,935
- HE'S A STRANGE MONK.

80
00:06:31,435 --> 00:06:34,202
- THAT WOMAN
IS NO ORDINARY DEMON.

81
00:06:34,235 --> 00:06:39,335
SHE IS MUCH STRONGER
AND MUCH MORE SINISTER.

82
00:06:39,368 --> 00:06:40,902
- LOOK YONDER.
IT'S LADY KIKYO.

83
00:06:40,935 --> 00:06:44,135
- LUCKILY, WE HAVE
SUCH A TALENTED AND KIND
PRIESTESS IN OUR MIDST.

84
00:06:44,168 --> 00:06:47,102
- AYE, SHE CURES OURS AILS
AND CHEERS THE CHILDREN.

85
00:06:47,135 --> 00:06:53,168
- IT IS SO.
WE ARE TRULY BLESSED, INDEED.

86
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:56,668
- THE WITCH URASUE

87
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:59,102
DESIRED THE SPIRITUAL
POWER OF A PRIESTESS,

88
00:06:59,135 --> 00:07:01,535
SO SHE ROBBED THE BONES
AND EARTH FROM MY GRAVE

89
00:07:01,568 --> 00:07:02,902
AND FIRED MY BODY IN HER KILN.

90
00:07:02,935 --> 00:07:06,968
THE SOUL THAT HAS TRANSMIGRATED
INTO THIS BODY SUITS ME WELL.

91
00:07:07,002 --> 00:07:09,935
WHY DID YOU BETRAY ME, INUYASHA?

92
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:13,768
FOR A SECOND TIME,
YOU ASKED ME TO DIE, INUYASHA.

93
00:07:13,802 --> 00:07:15,435
SO, WHY DO YOU LOOK SAD?

94
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,135
IS IT BECAUSE YOU FEEL
THE HEAT FROM MY HAND?

95
00:07:18,168 --> 00:07:21,968
THE HEAT OF ANGER,
THE FLAMES OF VENGEANCE.

96
00:07:24,135 --> 00:07:27,802
- KIKYO!

97
00:07:46,302 --> 00:07:48,135
- KIKYO?

98
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:50,502
DID YOU HEAR ME?

99
00:07:50,535 --> 00:07:52,068
- SAYO.

100
00:07:52,102 --> 00:07:56,535
- KIKYO, YOU WILL ALWAYS
STAY HERE WITH US, WON'T YOU?

101
00:07:56,568 --> 00:07:59,168
- HMM? HMM...

102
00:07:59,202 --> 00:08:02,602
TELL ME, SAYO,
ARE YOU FOND OF ME?

103
00:08:02,635 --> 00:08:03,568
- MMM-HMM.

104
00:08:03,602 --> 00:08:04,768
- THAT MAKES ME HAPPY.

105
00:08:04,802 --> 00:08:08,302
YOU ARE AS DEAR TO ME AS THOUGH
YOU WERE MY YOUNGER SISTER.

106
00:08:08,335 --> 00:08:10,202
- OHH, TRULY?

107
00:08:10,235 --> 00:08:11,968
- YES.

108
00:08:20,302 --> 00:08:22,202
I CAN LIVE HERE.

109
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,735
I CAN RESIDE IN THIS VILLAGE.

110
00:08:24,768 --> 00:08:27,135
I KNOW I CAN DO IT.

111
00:08:27,168 --> 00:08:32,302
BUT THE QUESTION REMAINS
WILL I BE PERMITTED TO DO IT?

112
00:08:39,802 --> 00:08:42,402
- WELL, EVERYTHING
LOOKS CLEAR OUTSIDE.

113
00:08:42,435 --> 00:08:44,135
ANYTHING UNUSUAL IN HERE?

114
00:08:44,168 --> 00:08:47,435
- NO, SO FAR
EVERYTHING'S BEEN GOOD.

115
00:08:47,468 --> 00:08:51,035
- GOOD--
SO, WHERE'D MIROKU GET TO?

116
00:08:51,068 --> 00:08:53,235
- IT SOUNDS LIKE THERE'S ONE
OTHER PRINCESS LIVING HERE,

117
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:56,735
SO MIROKU SAID HE WANTED
TO GO MAKE SURE SHE WAS SAFE.

118
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:57,535
- OH, SURE.

119
00:08:57,568 --> 00:09:00,202
- THE YOUNGER
PRINCESS IS PETRIFIED.

120
00:09:00,235 --> 00:09:02,035
- LEAVE HER--
I MEAN, THINGS--TO ME.

121
00:09:02,068 --> 00:09:06,868
IF SHE IS LIKE HER SISTER,
THE YOUNGER PRINCESS MUST
BE A BEAUTY BEYOND COMPARE.

122
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:08,135
AHH, I LOVE MY JOB.

123
00:09:08,168 --> 00:09:11,568
- MIROKU, AM I SUPPOSED TO HELP
YOU PROTECT THIS YOUNGER SISTER?

124
00:09:11,602 --> 00:09:15,668
- FIRST WE MUST DO WHAT WE
CAN TO LAY HER FEARS TO REST.

125
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,968
PERHAPS YOU CAN TRANSFORM
INTO SOMETHING CUTE AND FUZZY.

126
00:09:19,002 --> 00:09:20,002
- WHAT FOR?

127
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:23,202
- A BUNNY.
I'VE ALWAYS WANTED
TO SEE ON UP CLOSE!

128
00:09:23,235 --> 00:09:24,268
YOU SEE?

129
00:09:24,302 --> 00:09:25,402
- NO, NOT REALLY.

130
00:09:25,435 --> 00:09:28,635
- I'LL EXPLAIN IT TO YOU ONE
DAY, WHEN YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH

131
00:09:28,668 --> 00:09:30,968
TO TALK MAN TO MAN.

132
00:09:31,002 --> 00:09:31,935
- HE'S SOME PLAYER.

133
00:09:31,968 --> 00:09:33,902
TOO BAD HE HAS
EVERYONE CONVINCED HE'S A SAINT.

134
00:09:33,935 --> 00:09:36,702
OTHERWISE, I'D GIVE
HIM A GOOD STOMPING.

135
00:09:36,735 --> 00:09:37,968
HMMM?

136
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:40,802
UH, ISN'T THIS
A LITTLE CLOSE, KAGOME?

137
00:09:40,835 --> 00:09:42,602
- DEAL WITH IT.
SHE'S CREEPING ME OUT.

138
00:09:42,635 --> 00:09:46,902
IT'S ALMOST LIKE SHE COULD
SPRING TO LIFE ANY MINUTE NOW.

139
00:09:47,868 --> 00:09:51,435
- HMM? THAT WAS YOUR MOTIVATION?

140
00:09:51,468 --> 00:09:52,568
- WHY ELSE WOULD IT BE?

141
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:54,402
HEY, GET YOUR MIND
OUT OF THE GUTTER,

142
00:09:54,435 --> 00:09:57,168
AND CONCENTRATE ON WHAT
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING.

143
00:09:57,202 --> 00:09:58,302
- GUTTER?! AS IF!

144
00:09:58,335 --> 00:10:00,568
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO JUMPED ME
AND STARTED PRESSING FLESH.

145
00:10:00,602 --> 00:10:02,968
- A-HA! SO YOU DID HAVE
YOUR MIND IN THE TRASH.

146
00:10:03,002 --> 00:10:05,168
- I WAS MINDING MY OWN BUSINESS!

147
00:10:05,202 --> 00:10:06,935
- YOU WERE HITTING ON ME.

148
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:08,035
- I MUST TAKE LEAVE.

149
00:10:08,068 --> 00:10:10,968
YOUR SISTER'S SOUL REQUIRES
MY UNWAVERING PROTECTION.

150
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:13,702
- DO NOT ABANDON ME,
MASTER MIROKU!

151
00:10:13,735 --> 00:10:14,702
I FEAR FOR MY SAFETY.

152
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:18,435
- NO ONE WILL
COME AFTER YOU.
I GUARANTEE IT.

153
00:10:18,468 --> 00:10:20,668
- YOU ARE TOO CRUEL.

154
00:10:22,535 --> 00:10:25,268
- AAAHH!

155
00:10:38,168 --> 00:10:40,135

AND COME ON, WHO'S TO SAY?

SHE MIGHT HAVE
CHANGED FOR THE BETTER.
