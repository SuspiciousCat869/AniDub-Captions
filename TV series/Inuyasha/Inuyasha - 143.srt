00:01:46,953 --> 00:01:49,019
>> I AM HAKUDOUSHI.

2
00:01:49,019 --> 00:01:50,753
AS YOU GUESSED, I AM NARAKU'S

3
00:01:50,753 --> 00:01:52,086
INCARNATION.

4
00:01:52,086 --> 00:01:53,486
>> HAKUDOUSHI?

5
00:01:53,486 --> 00:01:54,953
>> SO YOU ARE ONE OF NARAKU'S

6
00:01:54,953 --> 00:01:55,686
CREATIONS?

7
00:01:55,686 --> 00:01:56,586
>> I WILL SEARCH FOR

8
00:01:56,586 --> 00:01:57,919
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

9
00:01:57,919 --> 00:01:59,719
WOULD YOU CARE TO JOIN ME?

10
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:00,519
>> YOU'RE LOOKING FOR

11
00:02:00,519 --> 00:02:01,586
THE JEWEL SHARD?

12
00:02:01,586 --> 00:02:02,519
HUH.

13
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,719
I DON'T GIVE A DAMN ABOUT THE

14
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:05,119
NEXT WORLD OR WHATEVER, BUT IF

15
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:06,453
THERE'S A SHARD TO BE FOUND

16
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:10,319
THERE, THEN GO FIND IT YOURSELF!

17
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:25,819
YAH!

18
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:34,019
>> CURSE YOU.

19
00:02:34,019 --> 00:02:36,186
>> WHAT IS THIS BRAT PLANNING

20
00:02:36,186 --> 00:02:39,753
ANYWAY?

21
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:53,153
>> LET'S GO.

22
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:54,219
>> HEY, LOOK, I WONDER

23
00:02:54,219 --> 00:02:56,019
WHAT'S GOING ON.

24
00:02:56,019 --> 00:03:02,919
>> YEAH.

25
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,819
>> I WILL VOLUNTEER TO GO SPEAK

26
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:06,086
TO THEM.

27
00:03:06,086 --> 00:03:06,886
MISS, I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER

28
00:03:06,886 --> 00:03:07,886
BEARING MY CHILD.

29
00:03:07,886 --> 00:03:09,453
IT'S THE CHANCE OF A LIFETIME.

30
00:03:09,453 --> 00:03:11,986
>> WHAT WAS THAT, MONK?

31
00:03:11,986 --> 00:03:16,153
GRR...

32
00:03:16,153 --> 00:03:17,153
>> YAH...

33
00:03:17,153 --> 00:03:18,619
>> WHAT AN IDIOT.

34
00:03:18,619 --> 00:03:19,953
>> IT WAS A GREETING.

35
00:03:19,953 --> 00:03:21,319
>> EXCUSE ME, DID SOMETHING

36
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:22,719
HAPPEN HERE?

37
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:23,519
>> IT CERTAINLY DID.

38
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:24,653
OUR VILLAGE WAS ATTACKED BY

39
00:03:24,653 --> 00:03:25,919
A HEADLESS DEMON.

40
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:26,586
>> IT TORE UP

41
00:03:26,586 --> 00:03:27,786
THE ENTIRE VILLAGE.

42
00:03:27,786 --> 00:03:28,819
I WAS SCARED RIGHT OUT

43
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:30,286
OF MY WITS.

44
00:03:30,286 --> 00:03:31,886
>> AND THE DEMON, ARE YOU SURE

45
00:03:31,886 --> 00:03:32,753
IT WAS HEADLESS RIGHT FROM

46
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:33,886
THE START?

47
00:03:33,886 --> 00:03:34,953
>> YES.

48
00:03:34,953 --> 00:03:36,286
IT USED TO BE A MAN-EATING DEMON

49
00:03:36,286 --> 00:03:37,586
WHO LIVED OUT IN THE MOUNTAINS.

50
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:38,553
WE DON'T KNOW WHO RIPPED ITS

51
00:03:38,553 --> 00:03:39,586
HEAD OFF, BUT IT'S ALREADY

52
00:03:39,586 --> 00:03:40,853
INJURED MOST OF THE VILLAGERS,

53
00:03:40,853 --> 00:03:42,819
AND IT HASN'T STOPPED YET.

54
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:43,919
>> LEAVE IT TO US!

55
00:03:43,919 --> 00:03:45,153
WE SHALL SLAY THIS DEMON FOR

56
00:03:45,153 --> 00:03:46,253
YOU, GENTLEMEN!

57
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:48,086
HA HA!

58
00:03:48,086 --> 00:03:49,019
>> DO YOU THINK IT'S WISE

59
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:49,919
TO LET THIS MONK HANDLE

60
00:03:49,919 --> 00:03:50,853
THE PROBLEM FOR US?

61
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:51,753
>> NOT MOMENTS AGO, HE WAS

62
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:53,486
FLIRTING WITH ONE OF OUR WOMEN.

63
00:03:53,486 --> 00:03:54,886
>> I DON'T TRUST HIM.

64
00:03:54,886 --> 00:03:56,186
>> SO, SHALL WE CONTINUE

65
00:03:56,186 --> 00:04:00,853
ON OUR WAY?

66
00:04:00,853 --> 00:04:02,253
>> INUYASHA, TRACK THE DEMON'S

67
00:04:02,253 --> 00:04:03,919
SCENT SO WE CAN FOLLOW IT.

68
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,119
>> I DON'T REALLY NEED TO.

69
00:04:06,119 --> 00:04:07,086
IT'S PRETTY OBVIOUS WHICH WAY HE

70
00:04:07,086 --> 00:04:09,657
WENT, DON'T YOU THINK?

71
00:04:09,657 --> 00:04:21,057
>> TRUE ENOUGH.

72
00:04:21,057 --> 00:04:25,990
>> SPEAK OF THE DEVIL.

73
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:26,923
>> AAH!

74
00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:31,923
>> HUH?

75
00:04:31,923 --> 00:04:33,957
>> THAT GIRL IS IN DANGER!

76
00:04:33,957 --> 00:04:35,257
I GOTTA KEEP IT TOGETHER!

77
00:04:35,257 --> 00:04:36,223
>> COME BACK!

78
00:04:36,223 --> 00:04:42,590
HE'LL KILL YOU!

79
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:43,390
DAMN!

80
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:44,790
GET OUT OF HERE!

81
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:48,290
>> STOP IT!

82
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:49,923
>> UH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

83
00:04:49,923 --> 00:04:50,857
>> PLEASE, YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE

84
00:04:50,857 --> 00:04:52,057
HIM STOP.

85
00:04:52,057 --> 00:04:52,790
>> STOP?

86
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:54,023
BUT WHY?

87
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:57,523
>> AAH!

88
00:04:57,523 --> 00:04:59,390
>> A BABY RACCOON DOG.

89
00:04:59,390 --> 00:05:00,323
>> THAT'S MY FATHER.

90
00:05:00,323 --> 00:05:00,990
I'M BEGGING YOU,

91
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,123
PLEASE DON'T HURT HIM.

92
00:05:02,123 --> 00:05:03,090
>> RACCOON DOG?

93
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:04,057
>> I'M AN OTTER.

94
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:05,190
>> WHATEVER?

95
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,223
YOU SURE DON'T LOOK LIKE YOU'RE

96
00:05:06,223 --> 00:05:07,390
RELATED TO THAT THING.

97
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,123
>> HUH?

98
00:05:08,123 --> 00:05:08,857
WAIT, THAT'S NOT

99
00:05:08,857 --> 00:05:09,857
MY FATHER.

100
00:05:09,857 --> 00:05:10,557
>> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU CAN MAKE

101
00:05:10,557 --> 00:05:12,123
A MISTAKE LIKE THAT.

102
00:05:12,123 --> 00:05:13,290
MAYBE EXPLAIN IT AFTER I TAKE

103
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:16,857
CARE OF UGLY HERE.

104
00:05:16,857 --> 00:05:36,523

>> I'M AN OTTER!

109
00:05:41,057 --> 00:05:41,890
>> HOW COME YOU DISGUISE

110
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:43,790
YOURSELF AS A HUMAN GIRL?

111
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,757
>> PA TOLD ME TO.

112
00:05:44,757 --> 00:05:46,257
HE SAID IF I PRETENDED TO BE A

113
00:05:46,257 --> 00:05:47,290
HUMAN GIRL, WHENEVER I LEFT THE

114

115
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:51,023
ALWAYS COME TO MY RESCUE.

116
00:05:51,023 --> 00:05:51,957

117
00:05:51,957 --> 00:05:53,790
PERCEPTIVE.

118
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,123
EARLIER, YOU CALLED THAT DEMON

119
00:05:55,123 --> 00:05:57,023
YOUR FATHER, DIDN'T YOU?

120
00:05:57,023 --> 00:05:58,590
>> YEAH.

121
00:05:58,590 --> 00:05:59,857
I'M LOOKING FOR MY PA.

122
00:05:59,857 --> 00:06:00,957
YOU SEE, I'VE GOT HIS HEAD

123
00:06:00,957 --> 00:06:02,223
INSIDE THIS BUNDLE.

124
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,257
>> WHAT?

125
00:06:03,257 --> 00:06:05,223
>> IT ALL STARTED 3 DAYS AGO.

126
00:06:05,223 --> 00:06:06,790
PA AND I WERE FISHING

127
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,157
IN THE RIVER.

128
00:06:10,157 --> 00:06:11,057

>> HA!

130
00:06:13,457 --> 00:06:15,557
THAT WAS INCREDIBLE, PA!

00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:16,590
>> IT'S EASY ONCE YOU GET

132
00:06:16,590 --> 00:06:17,590
THE HANG OF IT.

133
00:06:17,590 --> 00:06:18,557
WANT TO TRY?

RIVER'S DEPTH.

140
00:06:37,423 --> 00:06:38,890
CAN'T HAVE AN OTTER DROWNING

141
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,357
IN THE RIVER.

142
00:06:40,357 --> 00:06:41,190

143
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:42,223

518
00:23:34,639 --> 00:23:36,239
INUYASHA'S FATHER AT THE BORDER

519
00:23:36,239 --> 00:23:37,839
BETWEEN THIS LIFE AND THE NEXT.

520
00:23:37,839 --> 00:23:38,706
>> HUH.

521
00:23:38,706 --> 00:23:39,806
TIME TO VISIT THE OLD MAN'S

522
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:41,106
GRAVE, HUH?

523
00:23:41,106 --> 00:23:42,606
>> UNFORTUNATELY THE BLACK PEARL

524
00:23:42,606 --> 00:23:44,106
WE USED TO ENTER THE GRAVESITE

525
00:23:44,106 --> 00:23:45,906
CAN'T BE USED AGAIN.

526
00:23:45,906 --> 00:23:46,606
>> ARGH!

527
00:23:46,606 --> 00:23:48,239
ISN'T THERE SOME OTHER WAY IN?

528
00:23:48,239 --> 00:23:49,272
WHAT?

529
00:23:49,272 --> 00:23:50,306
A GUY NAMED HOSENKI KNOWS THE

530
00:23:50,306 --> 00:23:52,972
WAY AND CAN HELP US OUT?

531
00:23:52,972 --> 00:23:54,439
>> NEXT TIME, HOSENKI

532
00:23:54,439 --> 00:23:55,972
AND THE LAST SHARD.

533
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,372
>> I'LL TAKE IT BY FORCE

534
00:23:57,372 --> 00:23:59,372
IF I HAVE TO!
