- I DID IT!

170
00:11:16,777 --> 00:11:19,944
- HE PIERCED
RYUKOTSUSEI'S HEART.

171
00:11:21,177 --> 00:11:22,944
- IS HE DEAD?

172
00:11:23,544 --> 00:11:25,377
- UNH!

173
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:26,844
UH!

174
00:11:32,444 --> 00:11:33,410
- SO LIGHT.

175
00:11:33,444 --> 00:11:34,710
IT USED TO BE SO HEAVY,

176
00:11:34,744 --> 00:11:38,044
BUT NOW IT FEELS LIKE
AN EXTENSION OF MY HAND.

177
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:43,110
- HOW DARE HE WIELD
HIS SWORD AGAINST ME.

178
00:11:43,144 --> 00:11:46,110
YOU'LL PAY, LITTLE MAN!

179

- HASN'T THAT UGLY THING
KEELED OVER YET?

- WHAT A DEMON!

STABBED IN THE HEART,

182
00:12:03,877 --> 00:12:05,177
AND HE ACTS
LIKE NOTHING HAPPENED.

183
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:09,877
- RYUKOTSUSEI WAS A HANDFUL
EVEN FOR INUYASHA'S FATHER,
REMEMBER?

184
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:13,777
HE WON'T DIE UNLESS
HE'S HACKED INTO PIECES.

THE SCENT OF THE WINDSCAR.

195

AROUND THE TETSUSAIGA.

- HUH!

00:13:10,277 --> 00:13:11,944
RYUKOTSUSEI, YOU'RE IN
FOR A BIG SURPRISE,

200
00:13:11,977 --> 00:13:15,177
BECAUSE THINGS ARE
GONNA BE DIFFERENT NOW.

- NOT ONLY DID IT GET LIGHTER,

209

BUT NOW I CAN INVOKE
THE WINDSCAR ANYTIME I WANT.

DID YOU SEE THIS, TOTOSAI?
I WASTED THAT DEMON.

- WELL, I'LL GIVE YOU
THE CREDIT YOU DESERVE,

BUT IT'S TOO EARLY
TO REST ON YOUR LAURELS.

- WHAT'S WITH HIM, ANYWAY?

222
00:14:39,210 --> 00:14:42,777
- HE WAS HIT WITH THE WINDSCAR,
AND IT DIDN'T AFFECT HIM AT ALL.

FINISH HIM OFF THIS TIME.

RIGHT ABOUT HERE!

- THE WHIRLPOOL
AT THE TETSUSAIGA'S AURA

00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:18,317
IS PUSHING BACK

- VERY IMPRESSIVE,
MASTER INUYASHA.

298
00:19:28,084 --> 00:19:32,284
I KNEW FROM THE START YOU HAD
THE STRENGTH TO DEFEAT HIM.

299
00:19:32,317 --> 00:19:35,951
- WE HAD TO PRACTICALLY
DRAG HIM BACK HERE.

300
00:19:35,984 --> 00:19:37,051
- HMM.

THAN I GAVE YOU CREDIT FOR.

WHAT DID YOU DO
TO THE TETSUSAIGA, ANYWAY?

306
00:19:47,751 --> 00:19:50,084
IT'S MUCH BETTER THAN BEFORE.

307
00:19:50,117 --> 00:19:51,351
- WAIT A MINUTE.

308
00:19:51,384 --> 00:19:54,951
YOU USED THE TECHNIQUE
WITHOUT REALIZING?

00:19:54,984 --> 00:19:55,817
- HUH?

310
00:19:55,851 --> 00:20:00,351
- THE TETSUSAIGA'S
ULTIMATE TECHNIQUE:

311
00:20:00,384 --> 00:20:01,584
THE BACKLASH WAVE.

312
00:20:01,617 --> 00:20:04,817
- THE BACKLASH WAVE? HUH?

313
00:20:04,851 --> 00:20:05,684
- HUH?

314
00:20:05,717 --> 00:20:07,551
YOU'RE SAYING THAT
WAS THE BACKLASH WAVE?

315
00:20:07,584 --> 00:20:10,651
- PRECISELY. LET ME EXPLAIN.

316
00:20:10,684 --> 00:20:12,951
IT USES THE ENEMY'S
BLAST OF DEMONIC ENERGY,

317
00:20:12,984 --> 00:20:16,584
ENSNARING IT WITH THE WINDSCAR
AND REVERSING THE FLOW.

318
00:20:16,617 --> 00:20:18,684
- SO IT ENSNARES
THE ENEMY'S ENERGY

319
00:20:18,717 --> 00:20:19,784
AND SENDS IT BACK AT THEM?

320
00:20:19,817 --> 00:20:22,751
- THE WINDSCAR
AND THE DEMON'S ENERGY BLAST

321
00:20:22,784 --> 00:20:24,584
BECOME LIKE WHIRLPOOLS.

322
00:20:24,617 --> 00:20:28,584
IN OTHER WORDS, THE ENEMY
IS SIMULTANEOUSLY BLASTED

323
00:20:28,617 --> 00:20:33,017
BY THE WINDSCAR
AND BY HIS OWN DEMONIC AURA.

324
00:20:33,051 --> 00:20:35,551
ANYWAY, THAT'S THE THEORY.

325
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:36,917
- HUH?

326
00:20:36,951 --> 00:20:37,951
- THE TRICK IS HOW TO DISCERN

327
00:20:37,984 --> 00:20:40,651
PRECISELY WHERE TO CUT THROUGH
THE BLAST OF ENERGY,

328
00:20:40,684 --> 00:20:44,917
AND HIS AURA MUST BE
MUCH STRONGER THAN HIS ENEMY'S

329
00:20:44,951 --> 00:20:46,884
FOR THE TECHNIQUE TO SUCCEED.

330
00:20:46,917 --> 00:20:48,917
- I'M SO IMPRESSED, INUYASHA.

331
00:20:48,951 --> 00:20:50,551
- WHY? ALL I DID BACK THERE

332
00:20:50,584 --> 00:20:53,784
WAS USE MY INSTINCTS
AND FOLLOW MY NOSE.

333
00:20:53,817 --> 00:20:54,651
- HMM.

334
00:20:54,684 --> 00:20:56,184
HE'S SURPASSED MERE THEORY.

335
00:20:56,217 --> 00:20:59,884
PERHAPS HE'S DESTINED
FOR GREATER THINGS
THAN I IMAGINED.

336
00:20:59,917 --> 00:21:03,051
- INUYASHA, NOW IT APPEARS
IT WON'T BE SO HARD FOR YOU

337
00:21:03,084 --> 00:21:05,117
TO WIELD THE TETSUSAIGA
IN BATTLE.

338
00:21:05,151 --> 00:21:07,251
- IT'S EVEN BETTER THAN THAT.

339
00:21:07,284 --> 00:21:10,084
HA HA! WATCH THIS!

340
00:21:10,717 --> 00:21:12,684
HERE GOES NOTHING!

AAH!

- THE WINDSCAR.

343
00:21:22,351 --> 00:21:23,217
- WHAT DID I TELL YOU?

344
00:21:23,251 --> 00:21:26,984
I CAN INVOKE THE WINDSCAR
ANYTIME I WANT.

345
00:21:27,984 --> 00:21:29,417
UNH!

346

- HEY, WE GET
YOUR POINT ALREADY.

350
00:21:39,584 --> 00:21:42,451
- THAT'S NOT THE KIND OF THING
YOU WANT TO BE FLINGING AROUND

351
00:21:42,484 --> 00:21:44,317
LIKE SOME KIND OF TOY.

352
00:21:44,351 --> 00:21:45,451
- HA HA!

353
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,751
THERE'S NO ONE
WHO CAN BEAT ME NOW.

354
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:50,217
I DARE ANYONE TO STOP ME.

355
00:21:50,251 --> 00:21:51,817
- INUYASHA.

356
00:21:51,851 --> 00:21:53,251
- HUH?

357
00:21:53,284 --> 00:21:54,451
- SIT, BOY.

358
00:21:54,484 --> 00:21:55,384
- UNH!

359
00:21:55,417 --> 00:21:58,584
- ONE VICTORY,
AND HE THINKS HE'S INVINCIBLE.

360
00:21:58,617 --> 00:22:01,051
- I'LL SAY. SUCH A SIMPLETON.

361
00:22:01,084 --> 00:22:03,217
- NOT TO MENTION A SHOW-OFF.

362

- [GROANS]

363
00:22:04,984 --> 00:22:07,651
KAGOME HAD TO SAY IT.

364
00:22:09,917 --> 00:22:14,717
- WELL, HE'S STILL
A RUFFIAN, ALL RIGHT.

365
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:15,817
LET'S GO.

[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

367
00:23:58,699 --> 00:24:01,999
- A GIRL NAMED SATSUKI
HOLDS A LONE VIGIL

368
00:24:02,033 --> 00:24:03,466
FOR HER WAR-BOUND BROTHER.

369
00:24:03,499 --> 00:24:06,733
SHE POSSESSES A FRAGMENT
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

370
00:24:06,766 --> 00:24:08,233
AND USES IT AS A CHARM.

371
00:24:08,266 --> 00:24:12,033
IF IT TURNS OUT TO BE REAL,
WE HAVE TO TAKE IT FROM HER.

372
00:24:12,066 --> 00:24:15,566
POOR SHIPPO.
HAS HE FALLEN FOR SATSUKI?

373
00:24:15,599 --> 00:24:17,799
BEFORE WE HAVE TIME
TO FIGURE IT OUT,

374
00:24:17,833 --> 00:24:19,033
A DEMON LAYS A CRUEL TRAP

375
00:24:19,066 --> 00:24:22,466
IN ORDER TO GET
THE FRAGMENT FROM HER.

376
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:25,233
NEXT TIME...

377

SEE YOU SOON.
