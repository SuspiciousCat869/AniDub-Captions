- YEAH?

169
00:09:33,903 --> 00:09:35,736
- WHERE ARE WE GOING?

170
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:37,270
- NARAKU'S CASTLE.

171
00:09:37,303 --> 00:09:39,303
- SO, YOU KNOW WHERE IT IS NOW?

172
00:09:39,336 --> 00:09:40,703
- OF COURSE I DON'T, IDIOT.

173
00:09:40,736 --> 00:09:42,703
- THEN WE'RE JUST WALKING
AROUND IN CIRCLES?

174
00:09:42,736 --> 00:09:44,436
- STOP ASKING DUMB QUESTIONS!

175
00:09:45,573 --> 00:09:48,893
WE ARE BACKTRACKING THE PATH
THAT MUSO TOOK HERE!

176
00:09:48,893 --> 00:09:52,160
- SHOULD WE STOP IN AT ALL
THE VILLAGES HE RAIDED?

177
00:09:52,193 --> 00:09:53,227
- YES, WE SHOULD,

178
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,093
AS WELL AS THE SITE

179
00:09:54,127 --> 00:09:56,127
WHERE THE BANDITS
WERE ALL SLAUGHTERED.

180
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,627
- HUH?

181
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,360
KAGURA.

182
00:10:02,527 --> 00:10:03,693
- YO.

183
00:10:03,727 --> 00:10:04,627
- YOU WITCH!

184
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:06,227
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

185
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,093
- I HAVEN'T COME TO FIGHT.

186
00:10:08,127 --> 00:10:11,927
I SIMPLY WANT TO TELL
YOU WHERE MUSO IS.

187
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,793
- WHERE MUSO IS?

188
00:10:12,827 --> 00:10:14,627
- YOU MEAN, THAT DEMON
IS STILL ALIVE?

189
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:18,093
- YEAH, SOMETHING TOLD ME WE
WEREN'T THROUGH WITH HIM YET.

190
00:10:18,127 --> 00:10:20,393
HOW COME YOU'RE SO HELPFUL
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

191
00:10:20,427 --> 00:10:24,860
- YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THE CAVE
WHERE KIKYO AND ONIGUMO STAYED?

192
00:10:24,893 --> 00:10:27,727
WELL, THAT'S WHERE
MUSO IS HEADED.

193
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,693
- WHAT?

194
00:10:28,727 --> 00:10:31,360
- MUSO'S GONE TO ONIGUMO'S CAVE?

195
00:10:31,393 --> 00:10:33,193
- I'VE TOLD YOU ALL.

196
00:10:33,227 --> 00:10:34,527
FAREWELL.

197
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,327
- WAIT.

198
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,327
DID NARAKU SEND YOU
HERE TO TELL US?

199
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,360
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

200
00:10:38,393 --> 00:10:41,393
- DOES HE KNOW ABOUT
INUYASHA'S SECRET?

201
00:10:41,427 --> 00:10:42,460
- SHUT UP, MIROKU!

202
00:10:42,493 --> 00:10:43,793
WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?

203
00:10:43,827 --> 00:10:45,393
- SECRET?

204
00:10:45,427 --> 00:10:46,993
WHAT SECRET?

205
00:10:47,027 --> 00:10:50,093
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

206
00:10:53,193 --> 00:10:54,360
- AND THERE SHE GOES.

207
00:10:54,393 --> 00:10:56,593
WHAT WAS THAT LITTLE
VISIT ALL ABOUT?

208
00:10:56,627 --> 00:10:57,627
- LAST TIME WE SAW HER,

209
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,027
SHE WAS BETRAYING NARAKU
TO STEAL THE JEWEL SHARDS.

210
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,760
- IT DIDN'T SEEM LIKE
SHE WAS HELPING US

211
00:11:01,793 --> 00:11:04,093
SO THAT SHE COULD
GET BACK AT NARAKU.

212
00:11:04,127 --> 00:11:06,560
- I WONDER IF SHE
TOLD NARAKU ABOUT

213
00:11:06,593 --> 00:11:07,593
WHAT SHE SAW THAT NIGHT--

214
00:11:07,627 --> 00:11:10,260
HOW INUYASHA BECOMES MORTAL
DURING THE NEW MOON.

215
00:11:10,293 --> 00:11:12,493
- EITHER WAY, SHE'S
STILL NOT OUR ALLY.

216
00:11:12,527 --> 00:11:14,327
- WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?

217
00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,493
- YOU MEAN, ABOUT MUSO?

218
00:11:15,527 --> 00:11:19,293
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE KAGURA'S
WORD FOR IT AND BELIEVE HER.

219
00:11:19,327 --> 00:11:20,293
- HUH?
- HUH?

220
00:11:20,327 --> 00:11:21,727
- WELL, THAT'S A CHANGE.

221
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,493
MOST OF THE TIME,

222
00:11:22,527 --> 00:11:24,127
YOU WOULD JUST JUMP
AT THE CHANCE

223
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,460
TO TAKE OFF AND FIGHT.

224
00:11:25,493 --> 00:11:26,960
- SAVE IT, WOULD YOU?

225
00:11:26,993 --> 00:11:27,693
- AAH!

226
00:11:27,727 --> 00:11:28,593
I ONLY MEANT THAT, UH...

227
00:11:28,627 --> 00:11:31,893
- INUYASHA, WHAT ARE
YOU SO ON EDGE ABOUT?

228
00:11:31,927 --> 00:11:35,727
- I'M NOT UPSET, ALL RIGHT?

229
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,827
ARRGH!

230
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:41,393
THIS MUSO GUY IS REALLY
STARTING TO GET TO ME.

231
00:11:41,427 --> 00:11:43,693
WHAT'S HIS DEAL, ANYWAY?

232
00:11:43,727 --> 00:11:44,327
- HMM?

233
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:47,927
- I CAN'T UNDERSTAND NARAKU.

234
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:51,727
- GO TO INUYASHA AND TELL
HIM WHERE TO FIND MUSO,

235
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,927
THEN STAY NEAR
AND KEEP WATCH OVER HIM.

236
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:58,593
- IT'S LIKE HE'S CURIOUS
ABOUT MUSO'S ACTIONS.

237
00:11:58,627 --> 00:11:59,593
[GASPS]

238
00:11:59,627 --> 00:12:01,893
DOES THAT MEAN THAT, UNLIKE ME,

239
00:12:01,927 --> 00:12:05,760
MUSO ISN'T UNDER
NARAKU'S CONTROL?

240
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:10,193
[THUNDER]

241
00:12:10,227 --> 00:12:12,093
- WAIT, KAEDE!

242
00:12:12,127 --> 00:12:13,093
- HUH?

243
00:12:13,127 --> 00:12:14,327
YOU DIDN'T RETURN HOME, KAGOME?

244
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,560
- WELL, I THOUGHT
I'D BETTER TAKE A LOOK

245
00:12:16,593 --> 00:12:18,560
INSIDE THAT CAVE, TOO.

246
00:12:18,593 --> 00:12:19,827
- [SIGHS]

247
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:21,927
IT'S UP AHEAD.

248
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,793
- I REMEMBER.

249
00:12:23,827 --> 00:12:25,693
SOMEONE WAS WITH ME...

250
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:27,693
RIGHT HERE.

251
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,993
THAT'S HER!

252
00:12:31,027 --> 00:12:32,660
WHO IS SHE?

253
00:12:33,727 --> 00:12:35,527
- THERE IT IS.

254
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:40,627
- SO THIS IS WHERE
ONIGUMO ONCE STAYED.

255
00:12:41,993 --> 00:12:42,793
RIGHT HERE--

256
00:12:42,827 --> 00:12:46,093
THIS IS WHERE IT ALL BEGAN.

257
00:12:46,127 --> 00:12:47,427
- KAGOME?

258
00:12:47,460 --> 00:12:49,327
- [GASPS]

259
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,160
HMM?

260
00:12:50,193 --> 00:12:52,127
DON'T MIND ME.

261
00:12:53,193 --> 00:12:55,893
- IT WAS THAT WOMAN I DESIRED.

262
00:12:55,927 --> 00:12:57,827
THIS IS THE PLACE.

263
00:12:57,860 --> 00:12:59,727
IT WAS HERE THAT I--

264
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,627
AAH.

265
00:13:01,660 --> 00:13:03,127
HUH?

00:13:05,027 --> 00:13:05,760
- I'M FINE.

268
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:08,327
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME, KAEDE.

269
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,160
- AH!

270
00:13:09,193 --> 00:13:10,893
IT'S HER AGAIN!

271
00:13:10,927 --> 00:13:12,093
UHH!

272
00:13:12,127 --> 00:13:14,227
IT'S THAT WOMAN--
THE ONE I DESIRED...

273
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:18,327
EVEN IF IT MEANT HAVING TO
SELL MY SOUL TO DEMONS.

[PANTING]

275
00:13:20,493 --> 00:13:22,127
THAT WOMAN--

276
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,560
IT WAS HER I WANTED.

00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:31,193
KIKYO!

- THAT MAN IS MORTAL?

280
00:13:33,093 --> 00:13:35,827
- I FINALLY REMEMBERED
WHAT PAINED ME.

281
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:39,293
IT WAS KIKYO I LONGED FOR.

00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,693
I KNOW YOU.

- KAEDE!

287
00:13:45,827 --> 00:13:48,593
- I ONCE KNEW THIS DEMON,
BUT HIS NAME WASN'T MUSO.

288
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:50,593
WHY WOULD HE SHOW
HIMSELF AROUND HERE

289
00:13:50,627 --> 00:13:53,760
AFTER ALL THESE
YEARS HAVE PASSED?

290
00:13:54,693 --> 00:13:56,393
- STAY OUT OF MY WAY, OLD MAID.

291
00:13:56,427 --> 00:13:58,693
I HAVE COME HERE
SEEKING THAT WOMAN--

292
00:13:58,727 --> 00:14:01,993
THE WOMAN WHO IS
IDENTICAL TO KIKYO.

293
00:14:02,027 --> 00:14:02,727
- I KNEW IT!

00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:05,560
YOU ARE THE FUGITIVE ONIGUMO.

295
00:14:05,593 --> 00:14:06,793
- ONIGUMO?!

00:14:06,827 --> 00:14:08,327
- OUT OF MY WAY!

00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,227
- LEAVE HER ALONE!

- YOU WERE SUPPOSED
TO HAVE GONE HOME.

- SANGO, LOOK DOWN THERE.

HERE IN THIS VERY CAVE.

- INUYASHA, MUSO IS ONIGUMO.

HIS SOUL TO DEMONS

WAS BADLY BURNED.

00:15:19,234 --> 00:15:21,234
EVEN HIS FACE WAS
SCORCHED OFF...

333
00:15:21,268 --> 00:15:24,834
AND THAT IS WHY HE KEPT STEALING
THE FACES OF HIS VICTIMS.

334
00:15:24,868 --> 00:15:29,401
- ONIGUMO'S HEART MUST
HAVE BURST OUT FROM NARAKU.

335
00:15:29,434 --> 00:15:31,301
- I'VE REMEMBERED EVERYTHING,

336
00:15:31,334 --> 00:15:35,334
INCLUDING HOW KIKYO
DIED BACK THEN.

337
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:36,534
ARRGH!

338
00:15:36,568 --> 00:15:37,501
- DAMN IT!

339
00:15:37,534 --> 00:15:40,234
YOU ARE THE ONE THAT
INJURED HER, YOU BASTARD!

340
00:15:40,268 --> 00:15:41,268
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

341
00:15:41,301 --> 00:15:43,668
WHY DO YOU THINK
I FED MY VERY SOUL

342
00:15:43,701 --> 00:15:46,134
TO THE DEMONS THAT I SUMMONED?

343
00:15:46,168 --> 00:15:48,301
I WANTED POSSESSION
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

344
00:15:48,334 --> 00:15:51,934
AND A HEALTHY BODY SO
I COULD STEAL KIKYO AWAY

345
00:15:51,968 --> 00:15:53,034
AND LEAVE THIS CAVE.

346
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:58,468
BUT WHEN I GOT MY NEW BODY,
NOTHING WENT AS I PLANNED.

347
00:16:00,468 --> 00:16:03,101
THE FIRST THING I DID
WHEN I LEFT THE CAVE

348
00:16:03,134 --> 00:16:04,934
WAS CUT DOWN THE VERY WOMAN

349
00:16:04,968 --> 00:16:08,068
I HAD SOLD MY BODY AND SOUL FOR.

350
00:16:10,301 --> 00:16:11,534
- UNH!

351
00:16:11,568 --> 00:16:13,234
OHH.

352
00:16:13,268 --> 00:16:13,901
HUH?

353
00:16:13,934 --> 00:16:14,901
- WHEN NARAKU WAS BORN,

354
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:17,634
ONIGUMO'S CONSCIOUSNESS
STILL LIVED INSIDE HIM.

355
00:16:17,668 --> 00:16:19,901
- BUT NARAKU WAS
CREATED FROM THE UNION

356
00:16:19,934 --> 00:16:21,668
OF HUNDREDS OF DEMONS...

357
00:16:21,701 --> 00:16:23,901
AND THOSE DEMONS
HAD ONE DESIRE--

358
00:16:23,934 --> 00:16:26,834
THE DEATH OF MY SISTER,
THE PRIESTESS.

359
00:16:26,868 --> 00:16:28,368
- KIKYO FOLLOWED HIM--

360
00:16:28,401 --> 00:16:30,468
THAT HALF-DEMON INUYASHA--

361
00:16:30,501 --> 00:16:33,568
STRAIGHT INTO HER VERY DEMISE.

362
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,934
KIKYO PERISHED,
AND THE SACRED JEWEL

363
00:16:39,968 --> 00:16:42,468
WAS BURNED ALONG
WITH HER CORPSE.

364
00:16:42,501 --> 00:16:45,034
AT THAT VERY SAME TIME--

365
00:16:45,068 --> 00:16:47,134
- VANISH.

366
00:16:48,468 --> 00:16:53,668
- SOMEONE PURGED ME
TO A DEEP, DARK PLACE.

367
00:16:54,701 --> 00:16:56,634
- THAT MUST HAVE BEEN NARAKU.

368
00:16:56,668 --> 00:16:57,734
- UH...UNH.

369
00:16:57,768 --> 00:17:00,768
I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW
MANY YEARS I LAY DORMANT FOR,

370
00:17:00,801 --> 00:17:01,934
BUT WHEN I FINALLY AWOKE,

371
00:17:01,968 --> 00:17:05,568
I HAD BEEN HURLED BACK INTO
THE OUTSIDE WORLD AGAIN.

372
00:17:05,601 --> 00:17:07,801
- HE HAS FORGOTTEN EVERYTHING,

373
00:17:07,834 --> 00:17:10,301
EVEN ABOUT NARAKU.

374
00:17:10,334 --> 00:17:14,501
HAVE YOU NOT RECEIVED
ORDERS FROM NARAKU?

375
00:17:14,534 --> 00:17:15,201
- HA!

376
00:17:15,234 --> 00:17:16,901
I TAKE ORDERS FROM NO ONE.

377
00:17:16,934 --> 00:17:18,601
I SLAUGHTER EVERYONE I HATE,

378
00:17:18,634 --> 00:17:21,401
AND BURN THEM TO THE GROUND.

379
00:17:21,434 --> 00:17:24,901
NOW, THEN, INUYASHA,
YOU'RE FIRST.

380
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:27,901
WHY ARE YOU STILL ALIVE, ANYWAY?

381
00:17:27,934 --> 00:17:30,668
KIKYO'S DEAD.

382
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:31,701
- YOU'RE ONE TO TALK.

383
00:17:31,734 --> 00:17:33,734
WHAT ARE YOU DOING COMING
BACK TO LIFE LIKE THIS?

384
00:17:33,768 --> 00:17:35,168
- I'M GOING TO KILL YOU FIRST,

385
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:38,301
AND THEN I'LL DEAL
WITH THAT WOMAN.

386
00:17:38,334 --> 00:17:39,134
- WHO, ME?

387
00:17:39,168 --> 00:17:41,034
- YOU'RE NOT LAYING
A HAND ON KAGOME!

388
00:17:41,068 --> 00:17:43,268
YOU GOT TO GET THROUGH ME FIRST!

389
00:17:43,301 --> 00:17:44,068
- FINE.

390
00:17:44,101 --> 00:17:46,568
THEN LET'S GET
ON WITH IT, SHALL WE?

391
00:17:46,601 --> 00:17:47,501
- POISON INSECTS.

392
00:17:47,534 --> 00:17:50,868
- KAEDE AND KAGOME,
GET BACK OUT OF DANGER.

393
00:17:50,901 --> 00:17:51,701
- HMPH!

394
00:17:51,734 --> 00:17:55,468
I DON'T KNOW WHY
NARAKU LET YOU OUT...

395
00:17:55,501 --> 00:17:59,201
BUT YOU'LL GET EXACTLY THE SAME
TREATMENT I'D GIVE HIM.

396
00:17:59,234 --> 00:17:59,834
AAH!

397
00:17:59,868 --> 00:18:01,634
HERE'S PAYBACK FOR KIKYO!

398
00:18:01,668 --> 00:18:03,201

00:18:11,401 --> 00:18:12,301
IT ALL MAKES SENSE NOW.

00:18:12,334 --> 00:18:15,534
MUSO HAS THE POWER
TO REGENERATE HIS BODY.

406

- YEAH? WHO CARES?

- DAMN YOU!

412
00:18:25,668 --> 00:18:27,634
- I KNEW THAT I SHOULD
HAVE SUCKED MUSO UP

413
00:18:27,668 --> 00:18:29,834
WITH MY WIND TUNNEL
WHILE I HAD THE CHANCE.

414
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:32,868
- DOES THIS MEAN NARAKU
IS PROTECTING MUSO?

415
00:18:32,901 --> 00:18:33,834
- IT'S LOOKING THAT WAY.

416
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:35,968
HE MUST HAVE SENT
THOSE POISON INSECTS HERE

00:18:36,001 --> 00:18:38,334
TO PREVENT ME FROM
USING MY WIND TUNNEL.

418
00:18:38,368 --> 00:18:40,234
- THEN WHY DOES
MUSO KEEP INSISTING

419
00:18:40,268 --> 00:18:42,268
THAT HE TAKES
ORDERS FROM NO ONE?

TO THIS BODY OF MINE.

495
00:22:05,701 --> 00:22:06,401
- UNH!

496
00:22:06,434 --> 00:22:08,434
- INUYASHA, LOOK OUT!

497
00:22:08,468 --> 00:22:11,134
- AAH!

498
00:22:11,168 --> 00:22:12,101
AAH!

499
00:22:12,134 --> 00:22:14,034
- INUYASHA!

500
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:16,634
- [GROANING]

501
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:37,801
- [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

502
00:23:57,596 --> 00:24:01,596
- ONIGUMO'S HEART WAS ALIVE
AND BEATING INSIDE NARAKU.

503
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:03,063
- NARAKU EXPELLED IT,

504
00:24:03,096 --> 00:24:04,730
AND IT TURNED INTO MUSO.

505
00:24:04,763 --> 00:24:06,030
- IT'S STRANGE, KAGOME.

506
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:07,730
NARAKU IS TRYING
TO PROTECT MUSO.

507
00:24:07,763 --> 00:24:10,230
WHY GET RID OF HIM,
THEN TRY TO HELP HIM?

508
00:24:10,263 --> 00:24:14,363
- NARAKU IS TRYING TO ABSORB
MUSO BACK INTO HIS BODY!

509
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:15,096
- HUH?

510
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:17,463
MUSO HAS HIS CLAWS IN NARAKU.

511
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,330
WHAT'S GOING ON?

512
00:24:18,363 --> 00:24:20,030
- ARE MUSO AND NARAKU ENEMIES?

513
00:24:20,063 --> 00:24:23,096
NEXT TIME, "THREE-SIDED
BATTLE TO THE DEATH."

514
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:24,130
THE KEY TO IT ALL IS
THAT SPIDER ON THE BACK.
