FULLY RECOVERED BY NOW.

5

YOU WANT TO HUNT DOWN THAT
NARAKU CREEP, TOO, RIGHT?

6
00:01:37,503 --> 00:01:40,469
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST
JOIN US FOR A WHILE?

ENTHUSIASM FOR MY OFFER.

CHASE NARAKU.

A HUGE SHRINE IS RIGHT
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

YOU'RE THE REAL SON OF

THEY'VE GOT THE SAME EYEBROWS
AND FOREHEAD.

- WHY ARE YOU SO EAGER
TO DO THIS?

144
00:07:00,036 --> 00:07:03,469
- THE WATER GOD STARTED
DEMANDING HUMAN SACRIFICES

145
00:07:03,503 --> 00:07:05,303
FROM OUR VILLAGE
ABOUT HALF A YEAR AGO.

146
00:07:05,336 --> 00:07:07,069
WE'VE HAD HEAVY RAINS
AND FLOODING.

147
00:07:07,103 --> 00:07:10,069
THE WATER GOD SAID THAT
IN ORDER TO LIFT THE CURSE,

148
00:07:10,103 --> 00:07:12,669
A HUMAN SACRIFICE
WAS NECESSARY.

149
00:07:12,703 --> 00:07:13,703
A CHILD WAS SELECTED

150
00:07:13,736 --> 00:07:17,236
WHEN A WHITE ARROW LANDED
ON THE ROOF OF HIS HOME.

151
00:07:17,269 --> 00:07:18,436
FATHER WOULD ALWAYS SAY...

152
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,236
- PLEASE BEAR THE LOSS
FOR THE SAKE OF THE VILLAGE.

153
00:07:21,269 --> 00:07:24,236
- BUT WHEN THE ARROW
LANDED ON OUR ROOF,

154
00:07:24,269 --> 00:07:25,803
HE TOLD ME TO GO AND HIDE.

155
00:07:25,836 --> 00:07:28,636
- SO HE FOUND ANOTHER CHILD
TO TAKE YOUR PLACE,

156
00:07:28,669 --> 00:07:29,936
AND MEANWHILE YOU'RE IN HIDING?

157
00:07:29,969 --> 00:07:33,069
- [SIGH] WHAT A STUPID,
SELFISH PARENT.

479
00:21:49,051 --> 00:21:51,518
- I THINK WE SHOULD SELL THESE
THINGS OFF IN THE NEXT VILLAGE

480
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:53,385
AND HAVE A BIG PARTY
TO CELEBRATE.

481
00:21:53,418 --> 00:21:55,318
- OH,
THAT'S THE LAST TIME I DO

482
00:21:55,351 --> 00:21:58,651
ANY ACTS OF HUMAN KINDNESS
WITH YOU.

483
00:22:03,085 --> 00:22:05,818
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

484
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:38,667
- THIS IS STRANGE.

485
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,667
I HAVEN'T SEEN MIROKU
SINCE THIS MORNING.

486
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:41,467
ACCORDING TO MYOGA,

487
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,867
MIROKU WAS LOOKING AT
HIS RIGHT HAND

488
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:45,434
WITH A SERIOUS EXPRESSION
LAST NIGHT.

489
00:23:45,467 --> 00:23:48,400
THERE'S MORE OF
THOSE POISONOUS INSECTS!

490
00:23:48,434 --> 00:23:50,467
IT MIGHT BE A TRAP
SET BY NARAKU.

491
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:52,500
MIROKU'S WIND TUNNEL
HAS BEEN INJURED,

492
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:54,567
AND HE'S SURROUNDED BY DEMONS.

493
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:56,000
INUYASHA, HURRY.

494
00:23:56,034 --> 00:23:57,834
I THINK MIROKU PLANS
TO DIE FIGHTING.

495
00:23:57,867 --> 00:24:02,267
NEXT TIME, "MIROKU FALLS INTO
A DANGEROUS TRAP."

496
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:03,300
SEE YOU SOON!
