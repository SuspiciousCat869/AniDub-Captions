00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:29,711
THAN YOU FINE FOLKS TO HELP ME

175
00:06:29,711 --> 00:06:30,744
WITH IT.

176
00:06:30,744 --> 00:06:31,744
>> IS THERE SOME PROFIT TO BE

177
00:06:31,744 --> 00:06:32,611
MADE HERE?

178
00:06:32,611 --> 00:06:34,177
>> YES, THE LATEST JOB HAS BEEN

179
00:06:34,177 --> 00:06:35,344
MORE TROUBLE THAN I HAD

180
00:06:35,344 --> 00:06:36,411
ANTICIPATED AND I WAS

181
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:38,277
CONSIDERING GETTING MORE HELP.

182
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:39,277
>> THEN LET US HEAR YOU OUT,

183
00:06:39,277 --> 00:06:40,277
GOOD WOMAN.

184
00:06:40,277 --> 00:06:41,111
>> THERE HAVE BEEN MYSTERIOUS

185
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:45,777
HAPPENINGS IN THE NIGHT.

186
00:06:45,777 --> 00:06:46,844
ONLY THE HOMES OF THE WEALTHY

187
00:06:46,844 --> 00:06:48,311
ARE TARGETED.

188
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:49,044
NO MATTER HOW TIGHT THE

189
00:06:49,044 --> 00:06:51,444
SECURITY, SOMEBODY OR SOMETHING

190
00:06:51,444 --> 00:06:52,677
MANAGES TO BREAK INTO THE HOUSE

191
00:06:52,677 --> 00:06:55,944
AND STEAL EVERYTHING OF VALUE.

192
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:56,644
BECAUSE OF THE MYSTERIOUS

193
00:06:56,644 --> 00:06:58,477
CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE ROBBERIES,

194
00:06:58,477 --> 00:06:59,944
RUMOR HAS IT THAT A DEMON IS

195
00:06:59,944 --> 00:07:01,111
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

196
00:07:01,111 --> 00:07:02,277
EVIL DEEDS.

197
00:07:02,277 --> 00:07:03,144
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, MYSTERIOUS

198
00:07:03,144 --> 00:07:04,311
CIRCUMSTANCES?

199
00:07:04,311 --> 00:07:05,111
>> THE HOUSE CAN BE LOCKED UP

200
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:06,477
TIGHT, BUT SOMEHOW THE THIEF

201
00:07:06,477 --> 00:07:08,011
STILL MANAGES TO ENTER.

202
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:09,244
AND, THOUGH SOMETIMES AN OMINOUS

203
00:07:09,244 --> 00:07:10,677
PRESENCE IS FELT, NOTHING IS

204
00:07:10,677 --> 00:07:11,777
EVER SEEN.

205
00:07:11,777 --> 00:07:13,044
PEOPLE ARE SAYING THAT THIS

206
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:14,477
THIEF CAN WALK THROUGH WALLS AND

207
00:07:14,477 --> 00:07:15,911
BECOME INVISIBLE.

208
00:07:15,911 --> 00:07:17,211
>> JUST LIKE A NINJA.

209
00:07:17,211 --> 00:07:19,144
>> IMPOSSIBLE, EVEN FOR A NINJA.

210
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:19,911
>> THEN DOES THAT MEAN THIS

211
00:07:19,911 --> 00:07:21,144
THING CAN REALLY WALK THROUGH

212
00:07:21,144 --> 00:07:23,577
WALLS AND BECOME INVISIBLE?

213
00:07:23,577 --> 00:07:24,744
>> LOGIC DOES SUGGEST THAT IF

214
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:26,311
IT'S NOT THE WORK OF A HUMAN,

215
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,011
THEN IT MUST BE A DEMON.

216
00:07:28,011 --> 00:07:28,844
>> I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THROUGH

217
00:07:28,844 --> 00:07:30,111
HIS TRICKS.

218
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:31,477
'CAUSE THIS INVISIBLE ENEMY IS

219
00:07:31,477 --> 00:07:34,111
UNDOUBTEDLY USING DEMON MAGIC.

220
00:07:34,111 --> 00:07:35,244
>> AH, COME ON, GIVE IT A REST,

221
00:07:35,244 --> 00:07:35,944
SHIPPO.

222
00:07:35,944 --> 00:07:36,811
MAYBE YOU CAN SEE THROUGH HIS

223
00:07:36,811 --> 00:07:37,711
TRICKS, BUT I'LL SNIFF HIM OUT

224
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:38,711
FIRST.

225
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:39,544
>> YOU GIVE IT A REST, YOU'RE

226
00:07:39,544 --> 00:07:40,711
ALWAYS BEING SUCKERED IN BY

227
00:07:40,711 --> 00:07:41,811
DEMON MAGIC.

228
00:07:41,811 --> 00:07:43,011
>> WHATEVER, THE ONLY MAGIC YOU

229
00:07:43,011 --> 00:07:44,477
PERFORM IS TO RUN AWAY.

230
00:07:44,477 --> 00:07:46,077
>> SHUT UP, THAT'S NOT TRUE!

231
00:07:46,077 --> 00:07:47,011
>> AND FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

232
00:07:47,011 --> 00:07:48,344
I LET MYSELF GET TRICKED ON

233
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,411
PURPOSE.

234
00:07:49,411 --> 00:07:50,377
>> STOP IT, YOU TWO, RIGHT THIS

235
00:07:50,377 --> 00:07:51,211
MINUTE.

236
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,077
>> HUH.

237
00:07:52,077 --> 00:07:53,211
>> HUH.

238
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:55,044
>> HEY, WHERE'S MIROKU GOING?

239
00:07:55,044 --> 00:07:56,077
>> WHEN YOU'VE SORTED THINGS OUT

240
00:07:56,077 --> 00:08:03,754
YOU CAN FOLLOW US, OK?

241
00:08:03,754 --> 00:08:04,921
THIS IS THE TOWN'S SECOND

242
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:06,587
RICHEST HOUSEHOLD.

243
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:07,354
>> OH?

244
00:08:07,354 --> 00:08:08,487
>> BOTH THE RICHEST AND SECOND

245
00:08:08,487 --> 00:08:09,754
RICHEST HOMES HAVE BEEN ROBBED

246
00:08:09,754 --> 00:08:11,021
ALREADY, AND I'VE BEEN EMPLOYED

247
00:08:11,021 --> 00:08:12,554
BY THEM BOTH, SO RATHER THAN

248
00:08:12,554 --> 00:08:13,887
MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES, I WANT

249
00:08:13,887 --> 00:08:15,187
TO BREAK UP INTO 2 GROUPS AND

250
00:08:15,187 --> 00:08:16,887
STAKE OUT EACH HOUSE.

251
00:08:16,887 --> 00:08:18,187
>> THAT SEEMS REASONABLE.

252
00:08:18,187 --> 00:08:20,821
HOW DO YOU WANT TO DIVIDE US UP?

253
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:21,821
>> I REFUSE TO TEAM UP WITH

254
00:08:21,821 --> 00:08:22,854
INUYASHA.

255
00:08:22,854 --> 00:08:23,954
>> HMM.

256
00:08:23,954 --> 00:08:25,154
DAMN RIGHT, I DON'T NEED YOU

257
00:08:25,154 --> 00:08:26,354
ANYWAY.

258
00:08:26,354 --> 00:08:27,221
>> INUYASHA WILL JUST END UP

259
00:08:27,221 --> 00:08:28,621
BEING TRICKED BY DEMON MAGIC

260
00:08:28,621 --> 00:08:29,454
AGAIN.

261
00:08:29,454 --> 00:08:30,354
>> SHUT UP, SHORT STUFF.

262
00:08:30,354 --> 00:08:31,421
I'LL CUT DOWN THE CRIMINAL WITH

263
00:08:31,421 --> 00:08:32,887
MY WIND SCAR.

264
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:33,721
>> UHH, OHH.

265
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,854
>> STOP IT, INUYASHA!

266
00:08:34,854 --> 00:08:36,087
>> MIROKU AND I MUST WORK

267
00:08:36,087 --> 00:08:37,421
SEPARATELY SINCE WE BOTH USE

268
00:08:37,421 --> 00:08:38,787
SPIRITUAL POWERS.

269
00:08:38,787 --> 00:08:40,354
>> HUH?

270
00:08:40,354 --> 00:08:42,721
>> RIGHT, SPIRITUAL POWERS.

271
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:44,221
SANGO, CAN YOU WATCH OVER MY

272
00:08:44,221 --> 00:08:46,321
ESTEEMED SPIRITUAL PEER?

273
00:08:46,321 --> 00:08:49,054
>> NO PROBLEM, COME ON, KIRARA.

274
00:08:49,054 --> 00:08:49,987
>> ALL RIGHT THEN, THE OTHER

275
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:51,554
GIRL GOES WITH THE MONK.

276
00:08:51,554 --> 00:08:52,821
>> SO I GUESS I'M ON MIROKU'S

277
00:08:52,821 --> 00:08:54,654
TEAM.

278
00:08:54,654 --> 00:08:56,154
>> MIROKU WILL PROBABLY BE MUCH

279
00:08:56,154 --> 00:08:57,187
MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE

280
00:08:57,187 --> 00:08:58,454
OLD WOMAN.

281
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,987
>> EVEN MIROKU'S MORE USEFUL

282
00:08:59,987 --> 00:09:01,687
THAN THAT OLD HAG.

283
00:09:01,687 --> 00:09:02,854
>> IF INUYASHA GOES WITH THE

284
00:09:02,854 --> 00:09:04,287
OTHER GROUP, THERE WON'T BE

285
00:09:04,287 --> 00:09:05,154
ANYONE THERE TO KEEP HIM

286
00:09:05,154 --> 00:09:05,821
IN LINE.

287
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:07,121
>> MY SENTIMENTS EXACTLY.

288
00:09:07,121 --> 00:09:08,087
SHIPPO?

289
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,121
I THINK IT WOULD BE BEST IF YOU

290
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,121
WERE TO HELP THE EXORCIST WITH

291
00:09:10,121 --> 00:09:11,754
YOUR FOX DEMON MAGIC.

292
00:09:11,754 --> 00:09:13,487
>> WHAT--ME HELP THE OLD WOMAN?

293
00:09:13,487 --> 00:09:14,287
>> AND DON'T COME RUNNING BACK

294
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:16,421
TO US.

295
00:09:16,421 --> 00:09:17,754
>> HUH, I'LL USE MY FOX DEMON

296
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,654
MAGIC TO CATCH THIS BANDIT.

297
00:09:19,654 --> 00:09:20,487
>> WELL, THAT'S ALL SETTLED

298
00:09:20,487 --> 00:09:21,287
THEN.

299
00:09:21,287 --> 00:09:22,354
I'LL LEAVE YOU IN CHARGE OF THIS

300
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,587
HOUSE, MIROKU.

301
00:09:23,587 --> 00:09:24,854
WE'RE OFF TO THE TOWN'S FIRST

302
00:09:24,854 --> 00:09:27,154
RICHEST HOUSE.

303
00:09:27,154 --> 00:09:31,821
>> PLEASE TRY TO HELP US.

304
00:09:31,821 --> 00:09:32,654
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK WE SHOULD

305
00:09:32,654 --> 00:09:33,487
DO?

306
00:09:33,487 --> 00:09:34,521
>> OK, WELL, THIS DEMON OR

307
00:09:34,521 --> 00:09:35,887
WHATEVER THE HECK IT IS ONLY

308
00:09:35,887 --> 00:09:37,421
STRIKES AT NIGHT, RIGHT?

309
00:09:37,421 --> 00:09:38,654
SO, WE WAIT FOR IT.

310
00:09:38,654 --> 00:09:39,687
>> RIGHT.

311
00:09:39,687 --> 00:09:40,787
SO WE SHOULD REST AND SAVE OUR

312
00:09:40,787 --> 00:09:42,054
STRENGTH FOR LATER.

313
00:09:42,054 --> 00:09:42,921
>> DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE

314
00:09:42,921 --> 00:09:44,587
ALL RIGHT TO ASK FOR A BATH?

315
00:09:44,587 --> 00:09:45,754
>> DO WHATEVER YOU WANT.

316
00:09:45,754 --> 00:09:46,754
>> IF YOU TELL THEM IT'S IN

317
00:09:46,754 --> 00:09:47,954
PREPARATION FOR TONIGHT,

318
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,754
I'M SURE THEY WON'T OBJECT.

319
00:09:49,754 --> 00:09:53,154
RELAX AND ENJOY YOURSELF.

320
00:09:53,154 --> 00:09:55,154
[LAUGHS]

321
00:09:55,154 --> 00:09:56,487
>> I WONDER IF SHIPPO AND THE

322
00:09:56,487 --> 00:09:58,487
OTHERS ARE ALL RIGHT.

323
00:09:58,487 --> 00:09:59,721
>> I BEG OF YOU, DO YOUR BEST

324
00:09:59,721 --> 00:10:02,987
TO HELP US.

325
00:10:02,987 --> 00:10:04,821
>> THAT MAN SEEMS SO DEPRESSED.

326
00:10:04,821 --> 00:10:05,754
>> WELL, IT'S NO WONDER HE'S

327
00:10:05,754 --> 00:10:06,954
DEPRESSED, HIS HOUSE MAY BE

328
00:10:06,954 --> 00:10:08,554
BROKEN INTO TONIGHT.

329
00:10:08,554 --> 00:10:09,454
>> SO, THEN, WHAT DO YOU THINK

330
00:10:09,454 --> 00:10:10,721
WE SHOULD DO NOW?

331
00:10:10,721 --> 00:10:11,987
>> OH, I HAD A FEW IDEAS

332
00:10:11,987 --> 00:10:13,421
ABOUT--LOOK!

333
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:14,654
THE TEA LEAF IS STANDING UP.

334
00:10:14,654 --> 00:10:16,621
THAT IS A GOOD OMEN.

335
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:17,821
>> WHAT KIND OF IDEAS?

336
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:18,954
>> TELL ME, DO YOU REALLY KNOW

337
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,621
HOW TO USE DEMON MAGIC?

338
00:10:20,621 --> 00:10:21,887
>> OF COURSE I DO.

339
00:10:21,887 --> 00:10:23,487
>> AND CAN YOU DISAPPEAR, TOO?

340
00:10:23,487 --> 00:10:24,987
>> I CAN'T ACTUALLY DISAPPEAR AS

341
00:10:24,987 --> 00:10:26,487
SUCH, BUT I'VE HEARD OF DEMON

342
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:27,854

00:16:02,321 --> 00:16:03,321
'CAUSE YOU'RE SO CLOSE TO EACH

516
00:16:03,321 --> 00:16:04,221
OTHER.

517
00:16:04,221 --> 00:16:05,387
BUT SHIPPO'S A LOT SMALLER THAN

518
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,654
YOU, SO GO EASY ON HIM, OK?

519
00:16:07,654 --> 00:16:09,321
>> OH, I'LL GO EASY ON HIM.

520
00:16:09,321 --> 00:16:11,421
HUH.

521
00:16:11,421 --> 00:16:13,821
>> HMM, THAT WAS CARELESS OF ME.

522
00:16:13,821 --> 00:16:14,721
INUYASHA HAS A KEEN SENSE OF

523
00:16:14,721 --> 00:16:16,454
SMELL, HE MUST HAVE CAUGHT MY

524
00:16:16,454 --> 00:16:17,987
SCENT OR SOMETHING.

525
00:16:17,987 --> 00:16:19,121
>> HMM, LET'S HOPE THAT THE

526
00:16:19,121 --> 00:16:20,821
INVISIBLE DEMON DOESN'T HAVE A

527
00:16:20,821 --> 00:16:22,721
SHARP NOSE OR WE'RE IN TROUBLE.

528
00:16:22,721 --> 00:16:24,721
>> UH, SHIPPO?

529
00:16:24,721 --> 00:16:26,221
>> YES, WHAT IS IT, SANGO?

530
00:16:26,221 --> 00:16:28,487
>> OH...IT'S NOTHING.

531
00:16:28,487 --> 00:16:29,987
>> IT WILL BE DARK SOON.

532
00:16:29,987 --> 00:16:31,021
WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO GUARD THIS

533
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,787
FAMILY'S HEIRLOOM--A PRECIOUS

534
00:16:32,787 --> 00:16:34,154
ANCIENT SCROLL.

535
00:16:34,154 --> 00:16:35,421
>> AN OLD SCROLL?

536
00:16:35,421 --> 00:16:36,354
>> FOR SOME REASON, THE DEMON

537
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:37,887
HAS BEEN STEALING SCROLLS ON

538
00:16:37,887 --> 00:16:39,221
ROLLS OF SILK.

539
00:16:39,221 --> 00:16:46,587
>> HMM.

540
00:16:46,587 --> 00:16:48,221
>> SO, WE'VE ALL HAD OUR DINNER.

541
00:16:48,221 --> 00:16:49,521
>> AND TAKEN A BATH.

542
00:16:49,521 --> 00:16:50,721
>> NOW ALL THAT'S LEFT IS TO

543
00:16:50,721 --> 00:16:52,521
WAIT FOR THE CULPRIT TO APPEAR.

544
00:16:52,521 --> 00:16:53,654
>> I WONDER IF HE'LL SHOW UP.

545
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:54,821
>> YEAH, WHAT IF HE DOESN'T

546
00:16:54,821 --> 00:16:55,821
SHOW UP?

547
00:16:55,821 --> 00:16:56,887
>> WE WAIT.

548
00:16:56,887 --> 00:16:57,887
>> SO DO ALL 3 OF US HAVE TO

549
00:16:57,887 --> 00:16:59,087
STAY UP ALL NIGHT?

550
00:16:59,087 --> 00:17:00,387
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

551
00:17:00,387 --> 00:17:01,587
KAGOME, WHY DON'T YOU GO GET

552
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:02,454
SOME SLEEP IN THE NEXT ROOM?

553
00:17:02,454 --> 00:17:03,321
>> THANKS, BUT I'D LIKE TO STAY

554
00:17:03,321 --> 00:17:05,021
UP AS LONG AS I CAN.

555
00:17:05,021 --> 00:17:06,287
>> IT MAY NOT BE THIS HOUSE

556
00:17:06,287 --> 00:17:07,254
TONIGHT.

557
00:17:07,254 --> 00:17:08,421
>> SO, I WONDER WHEN AND WHERE

558
00:17:08,421 --> 00:17:12,554
THE DEMON WILL APPEAR?

559
00:17:12,554 --> 00:17:14,221
>> DID YOU JUST SENSE SOMETHING?

560
00:17:14,221 --> 00:17:15,854
>> NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

561
00:17:15,854 --> 00:17:16,687
>> HUH?

562
00:17:16,687 --> 00:17:18,221
UH, ALL RIGHT.

563
00:17:18,221 --> 00:17:19,454
I GUESS SHE WOULDN'T.

564
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,987
BY THE WAY, WHERE'S SHIPPO?

565
00:17:20,987 --> 00:17:22,187
>> HE MADE HIMSELF INVISIBLE AND

566
00:17:22,187 --> 00:17:24,054
IS WAITING BACK AT THE HOUSE.

567
00:17:24,054 --> 00:17:24,854
>> HUH?

568
00:17:24,854 --> 00:17:26,154
>> DON'T WORRY, EVEN IF THAT

569
00:17:26,154 --> 00:17:27,687
DEMON WERE TO SHOW UP, SHIPPO

570
00:17:27,687 --> 00:17:32,021
CAN'T BE SEEN SO HE'S SAFE.

571
00:17:32,021 --> 00:17:43,854
>> SHIPPO.

572
00:17:43,854 --> 00:17:46,098
>> HUH?

573
00:18:09,917 --> 00:18:11,417
>> AAH!

574
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:19,417
OOH, OOH.

575
00:18:19,417 --> 00:18:22,250
>> OH, WELL.

576
00:18:22,250 --> 00:18:24,083
HUH?

577
00:18:24,083 --> 00:18:28,750
WHOA...OHH, HO HO HO.

578
00:18:28,750 --> 00:18:43,583
OOH, OOH.

579
00:18:43,583 --> 00:18:47,417
>> WHOA!

580
00:18:47,417 --> 00:18:54,417
UH.

581
00:18:54,417 --> 00:18:55,250
NO!

582
00:18:55,250 --> 00:18:56,917
THE HANGING SCROLLS!

583
00:18:56,917 --> 00:18:58,750
FOX FIRE!

584
00:18:58,750 --> 00:19:06,783
>> OH!

585
00:19:06,783 --> 00:19:08,783
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

586
00:19:08,783 --> 00:19:10,517
>> UH, WHAT--ARE YOU SAYING YOU

587
00:19:10,517 --> 00:19:12,517
CAN ACTUALLY SEE ME?

588
00:19:12,517 --> 00:19:13,517
HUH?

589
00:19:13,517 --> 00:19:17,017
THIS IS BAD.

590
00:19:17,017 --> 00:19:19,350
SANGO, OLD WOMAN!

591
00:19:19,350 --> 00:19:25,183
>> HUH?

592
00:19:25,183 --> 00:19:28,850
>> WHOA...OH!

593
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,383
>> HUH.

594
00:19:31,383 --> 00:19:34,517
>> AAH!

595
00:19:34,517 --> 00:19:35,517
>> HMM?

596
00:19:35,517 --> 00:19:39,683
OHH!

597
00:19:39,683 --> 00:19:40,850
>> HOW DID THIS GIGANTIC DEMON

598
00:19:40,850 --> 00:19:42,517
MANAGE TO GET INSIDE THE HOUSE?

599
00:19:42,517 --> 00:19:43,517
>> HEY, HE'S NOT INVISIBLE

600
00:19:43,517 --> 00:19:53,317
AT ALL.

601
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:54,517
>> GIVE THEM TO ME.

602
00:19:54,517 --> 00:19:55,717
GIVE ME BACK THE TREASURES

603
00:19:55,717 --> 00:19:59,683
I FOUND.

604
00:19:59,683 --> 00:20:00,750
>> HE'S GONE.

605
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:02,550
>> HE IS INVISIBLE, AFTER ALL.

606
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:03,750
>> BUT HE HASN'T DISAPPEARED.

607
00:20:03,750 --> 00:20:05,083
>> HAND THEM OVER TO ME.

608
00:20:05,083 --> 00:20:07,650
>> AAH!

609
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:08,983
>> HEY, WHERE THE BLAZES

610
00:20:08,983 --> 00:20:10,783
ARE YOU?

611
00:20:10,783 --> 00:20:13,350
DAMN DEMON, SHOW YOURSELF!

612
00:20:13,350 --> 00:20:19,350
>> GIVE ME THE TREASURES!

613
00:20:19,350 --> 00:20:20,383
>> SHIPPO, WHY ARE YOU STUMBLING

614
00:20:20,383 --> 00:20:21,283
AROUND?

615
00:20:21,283 --> 00:20:22,383
>> INUYASHA.

616
00:20:22,383 --> 00:20:23,250
>> I SEE--YOU'RE TRYING TO

617
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,583
PROTECT THE TREASURES.

618
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:26,783
AND THAT MEANS--

619
00:20:26,783 --> 00:20:28,517
>> DO YOU SEE HIM?

620
00:20:28,517 --> 00:20:30,350
>> YUP.

621
00:20:30,350 --> 00:20:35,583
I SEE YOU.

622
00:20:35,583 --> 00:20:37,350
YOU'RE NOT GETTING AWAY.

623
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:39,017
UH!

624
00:20:39,017 --> 00:20:40,483
>> BUT--BUT HOW?

625
00:20:40,483 --> 00:20:41,483
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE HERE WITH

626
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:43,250
AN UNFAMILIAR SCENT.

627
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:44,350
>> HEY!

628
00:20:44,350 --> 00:20:45,583

629
00:20:45,583 --> 00:20:46,783
>> WELL, WE CAUGHT HIM, BUT WHAT

630
00:20:46,783 --> 00:20:48,183
DO WE DO WITH HIM NOW?

631
00:20:48,183 --> 00:20:50,183
>> PLEASE, PLEASE, SPARE ME.

632
00:20:50,183 --> 00:20:51,350
>> ON ONE CONDITION.

633
00:20:51,350 --> 00:20:52,183
>> HUH?

634
00:20:52,183 --> 00:20:53,183
>> RETURN EVERY SINGLE THING

635
00:20:53,183 --> 00:21:02,650
YOU'VE STOLEN.

636
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:03,450
>> THINGS THAT ARE THIN AND

637
00:21:03,450 --> 00:21:05,317
SHINY ATTRACT ME, SO I COULDN'T

638
00:21:05,317 --> 00:21:06,450
HELP MYSELF.

639
00:21:06,450 --> 00:21:07,483
>> THERE'S SO MUCH.

640
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:08,183
>> SHOULD WE DIVIDE UP

641
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,217
THE SPOILS?

642
00:21:09,217 --> 00:21:10,183
>> EVERYTHING GOES BACK TO ITS

OWNERS.

644
00:21:11,017 --> 00:21:12,117
>> OH, WELL, I'M SURE WE'LL BE

645
00:21:12,117 --> 00:21:13,383
RICHLY REWARDED.

646

647
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,017
TRICK WORKED OUT PERFECTLY.

648
00:21:17,017 --> 00:21:17,783
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN, NEW FOX

649
00:21:17,783 --> 00:21:18,583
MAGIC?

650
00:21:18,583 --> 00:21:19,550
>> WELL, IT'S A LITTLE SOMETHING

651
00:21:19,550 --> 00:21:20,917
I DISCOVERED EARLIER.

652
00:21:20,917 --> 00:21:22,517
YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND.

653
00:21:22,517 --> 00:21:23,283
>> YEAH.

654
00:21:23,283 --> 00:21:24,083
>> NOW THAT YOU'VE LEARNED YOUR

655
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:25,550
LESSON, PLEASE STAY AWAY FROM

656
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:26,350
HUMANS.

657
00:21:26,350 --> 00:21:30,783
>> YES, THANK YOU.

658
00:21:30,783 --> 00:21:32,517
>> WOW, HE'S PAPER THIN.

659
00:21:32,517 --> 00:21:33,850
>> SO, WHEN HE TURNS SIDEWAYS,

660
00:21:33,850 --> 00:21:35,183
HE APPEARS INVISIBLE.

661
00:21:35,183 --> 00:21:36,783
>> I WAS SO TERRIFIED, I REALLY

662
00:21:36,783 --> 00:21:37,950
THOUGHT THAT I'D FINALLY SEEN

663
00:21:37,950 --> 00:21:39,783
THIS INVISIBLE DEMON.

664
00:21:39,783 --> 00:21:40,783
>> OH, COME ON, ARE YOU STUPID,

665

>> I AM NOT STUPID.

667
00:21:42,950 --> 00:21:44,450
>> IF IT WAS INVISIBLE,

668
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:46,283
YOU WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SEE IT.

669
00:21:46,283 --> 00:21:52,283
>> OH, RIGHT.

670
00:23:31,634 --> 00:23:33,501
>> AKITOKI OF THE HOJO FAMILY

671
00:23:33,501 --> 00:23:35,234
CAME TO US WITH A PROBLEM.

672
00:23:35,234 --> 00:23:36,634
IT SEEMS HE'S ON ANOTHER JOURNEY

673
00:23:36,634 --> 00:23:38,201
TO SEAL AWAY SOMETHING CALLED

674
00:23:38,201 --> 00:23:40,201
THE NAGINATA OF KENKON.

675

HOJO I KNOW IN MY TIME.

677
00:23:43,767 --> 00:23:45,067
I SAW IN THEIR FAMILY TREE THAT

678
00:23:45,067 --> 00:23:46,434
THERE'S A GIRL NAMED KAGOME

679
00:23:46,434 --> 00:23:47,467
ON THERE.

680
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:48,501
CAN IT BE THAT I STAY IN THE

681
00:23:48,501 --> 00:23:49,834
PAST, AND I GET MARRIED TO

682
00:23:49,834 --> 00:23:52,001
AKITOKI?

683
00:23:52,001 --> 00:23:54,001
>> NEXT TIME, ON "INUYASHA."
