YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

515
00:20:25,005 --> 00:20:26,172
>> WE NEED TO BE ON OUR WAY NOW,

516
00:20:26,172 --> 00:20:27,505
MASTER.

517
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:34,505
>> YES.

518
00:20:34,505 --> 00:20:41,838
HMM.

519
00:20:41,838 --> 00:21:09,105
>> [LAUGHS]

520
00:21:09,105 --> 00:21:10,605
>> JUST WHAT IS THIS CREEPY KID

521
00:21:10,605 --> 00:21:12,272
UP TO ANYWAY?

522
00:21:12,272 --> 00:21:13,772
HALF KILLING SO MANY IMPORTANT

523
00:21:13,772 --> 00:21:15,938
MONKS AND PRIESTS, HE MUST BE

524
00:21:15,938 --> 00:21:16,938
PEERING INTO THEIR HEARTS

525
00:21:16,938 --> 00:21:18,272
OR SOMETHING.

526
00:21:18,272 --> 00:21:19,438
>> KAGURA, I'M DONE WITH THIS

527
00:21:19,438 --> 00:21:24,605
ONE, DISPOSE OF HIM FOR ME.

528
00:21:24,605 --> 00:21:26,338
I COULDN'T FIND ANYTHING.

529
00:21:26,338 --> 00:21:27,205
EVEN IF THEY'RE HIGHLY

530
00:21:27,205 --> 00:21:28,405
SPIRITUAL, THEY'RE STILL MERELY

531
00:21:28,405 --> 00:21:29,838
HUMANS.

532
00:21:29,838 --> 00:21:30,905
>> WHAT EXACTLY IS IT YOU WERE

533
00:21:30,905 --> 00:21:33,305
TRYING TO FIND?

534
00:21:33,305 --> 00:21:34,938
>> THE BORDER BETWEEN THIS WORLD

535
00:21:34,938 --> 00:21:37,438
AND THE NEXT.

536
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:38,938
THAT'S WHERE THE FINAL SHARD

537
00:21:38,938 --> 00:21:44,605
OF THE SACRED JEWEL LIES.

538
00:21:44,605 --> 00:21:49,467
>> [SNORES]

539
00:23:32,029 --> 00:23:33,029
>> A MYSTERIOUS INCIDENT THAT

540
00:23:33,029 --> 00:23:34,863
KEEPS HAPPENING AT NIGHT.

541
00:23:34,863 --> 00:23:36,029
>> THE HOUSES OF THE WEALTHY ARE

542
00:23:36,029 --> 00:23:37,696
TARGETED, REGARDLESS OF HOW WELL

543
00:23:37,696 --> 00:23:39,196
PROTECTED THEY ARE.

544
00:23:39,196 --> 00:23:40,196
>> SOMEONE BREAKS IN AND STEALS

545
00:23:40,196 --> 00:23:41,529
THEIR VALUABLES.

546
00:23:41,529 --> 00:23:42,696
>> IT'S NO ORDINARY BANDIT FROM

547
00:23:42,696 --> 00:23:43,863
THE LOOKS OF IT.

548
00:23:43,863 --> 00:23:45,363
>> A DEMON THAT CAN TURN ITSELF

549
00:23:45,363 --> 00:23:46,696
INVISIBLE, I WONDER IF WE CAN

550
00:23:46,696 --> 00:23:48,029
DEAL WITH IT WORKING WITH THAT

551
00:23:48,029 --> 00:23:50,363
OLD EXORCIST WOMAN?

552
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:52,863
>> NEXT ON "INUYASHA," A STRANGE

553
00:23:52,863 --> 00:23:54,696
INVISIBLE DEMON APPEARS.

554
00:23:54,696 --> 00:23:56,363
>> JUST LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME,

555
00:23:56,363 --> 00:23:57,696
I'LL SOLVE THIS MYSTERY

556
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:59,696
FOR SURE.
