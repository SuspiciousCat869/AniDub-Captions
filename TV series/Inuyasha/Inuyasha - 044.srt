1
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:50,215
- THESE OLD LEGS CAN'T KEEP UP.

2
00:01:50,248 --> 00:01:51,348
- I BEAT YOU.

3
00:01:51,381 --> 00:01:52,415
- OH, YOU FOOL.

4
00:01:52,448 --> 00:01:54,148
WE WEREN'T IN A RACE.

5
00:01:54,181 --> 00:01:55,481
LOOK AT THAT, MASTER JAKEN.

6
00:01:55,515 --> 00:02:00,448
IT'S A SLAIN DEMON,
JUST AS LORD SESSHOMARU
EXPLAINED TO US.

7
00:02:00,481 --> 00:02:03,348
- WHO ON EARTH
COULD HAVE DONE THIS?

8
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,248
- INUYASHA.

9
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:08,048
- LORD SESSHOMARU.

10
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,181
- INUYASHA DID THIS,

11
00:02:09,215 --> 00:02:13,115
ALTHOUGH I DOUBT
HE WAS ABLE TO ESCAPE UNSCATHED.

12
00:02:14,981 --> 00:02:16,348
- AAH!

13
00:02:16,381 --> 00:02:19,315
- I CAN SMELL IT
ON THE DEMON'S FANGS--

14
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:21,948
THE SCENT OF TETSUSAIGA.

15
00:02:22,915 --> 00:02:24,381
HMM. SO I WAS RIGHT.

16
00:02:24,415 --> 00:02:27,615
THESE FANGS
BROKE THE SWORD IN HALF.

17
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:30,115
- AAH!

18
00:02:30,148 --> 00:02:30,848
- COME WITH ME.

19
00:02:30,881 --> 00:02:33,015
- WE'RE TAKING
THE HEAD WITH US?

20
00:02:33,048 --> 00:02:34,915
- ENOUGH OF THAT, RIN.

21
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:37,281
STOP IT.

22
00:02:37,315 --> 00:02:38,415
- YES, MY LORD.

23
00:02:38,448 --> 00:02:42,848
- THE SCENT IN THE WIND
TELLS ME WHAT TRANSPIRED HERE.

24
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:44,615
ONE THING BAFFLES ME.

25
00:02:44,648 --> 00:02:48,881
THE SCENT OF INUYASHA'S BLOOD
HAS CHANGED.

26
00:02:48,915 --> 00:02:51,281
IT IS NOT THE SMELL
OF A HALF-DEMON.

27
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:55,215
INUYASHA'S BLOOD
HAS THE SAME SCENT
AS MY BLOOD...

28
00:02:55,248 --> 00:02:57,615
AND OF OUR FATHER'S.

29
00:03:11,381 --> 00:03:13,748
- WHEN TETSUSAIGA
WAS BIT IN TWO,

30
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:15,381
I WAS CERTAIN
I WAS GONNA DIE.

31
00:03:15,415 --> 00:03:20,615
MY ENTIRE BODY SUDDENLY BURNED
WITH A DESIRE TO LIVE.

32
00:03:20,648 --> 00:03:23,715
NEXT THING I KNEW,
I'D KILLED GOSHINKI.

33
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:26,348
AND THAT'S WHEN
I FELT SOMETHING STRANGE,

34
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:29,381
SOMETHING I'D NEVER
FELT BEFORE...

35
00:03:31,181 --> 00:03:35,381
PURE PLEASURE
FROM KILLING GOSHINKI.

36
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:38,081
- HERE.

37
00:03:38,115 --> 00:03:38,981
GRILLED FISH.

38
00:03:39,015 --> 00:03:40,015
THIS ONE'S FOR YOU.

39
00:03:40,048 --> 00:03:41,048
- YEAH? THANK YOU.

40
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:42,981
- OH, SNAP OUT OF IT,
WOULD YOU?

41
00:03:43,015 --> 00:03:46,415
QUIT MOPING
OVER YOUR BROKEN SWORD.

42
00:03:46,448 --> 00:03:47,715
AAH!

43
00:03:47,748 --> 00:03:48,748
THAT'S MY FISH.

44
00:03:48,781 --> 00:03:50,548
- NOT ANYMORE.

45
00:03:50,581 --> 00:03:52,048
- HUH?

46
00:03:52,915 --> 00:03:55,181
- AAH!

47
00:03:55,215 --> 00:03:57,315
- [MOO]

48
00:03:57,348 --> 00:03:58,615
- THE BULL THAT BELONGS
TO TOTOSAI,

49
00:03:58,648 --> 00:04:01,215
THE SWORDSMITH
THAT FORGED TETSUSAIGA.

50
00:04:01,248 --> 00:04:02,115
- IT CAME ALONE?

51
00:04:02,148 --> 00:04:04,915
- MASTER INUYASHA.

52
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:07,481
[SUCKING]

53
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:11,381
- MYOGA, YOU FOUND US.

54
00:04:11,415 --> 00:04:12,515
- IT IS HIM.

55
00:04:12,548 --> 00:04:15,415
YOU WERE HIDING OUT
AT MASTER TOTOSAI'S
ALL THIS TIME?

56
00:04:15,448 --> 00:04:18,315
- HOW RUDE,
MAKING ME SOUND
LIKE A COWARD.

57
00:04:18,348 --> 00:04:20,248
- WELL, YOU DID RUN AWAY.

58
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,615
- YEP. YOU SURE DID.

59
00:04:21,648 --> 00:04:22,481
- AHEM.

60
00:04:22,515 --> 00:04:23,581
NEVER MIND THAT.

61
00:04:23,615 --> 00:04:27,048
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED
TO TETSUSAIGA.

62
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:28,681
WHAT'S THAT?

63
00:04:28,715 --> 00:04:31,481
- A DEMON CALLED GOSHINKI
BIT IT IN HALF

64
00:04:31,515 --> 00:04:33,048
WHILE I WAS FIGHTING HIM.

65
00:04:33,081 --> 00:04:34,281
- JUST AS I SUSPECTED.

66
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:38,481
THAT EXPLAINS WHY THE SCENT
OF INUYASHA'S BLOOD
HAS CHANGED.

67
00:04:38,515 --> 00:04:39,281
MY LORD, PLEASE,

68
00:04:39,315 --> 00:04:40,848
YOU MUST TAKE THE PIECES
OF THE SWORD

69
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,281
AND GOT TO MASTER TOTOSAI,
TETSUSAIGA'S SWORDSMITH.

70
00:04:44,315 --> 00:04:47,715
- YOU MEAN TETSUSAIGA
CAN BE PUT BACK TOGETHER AGAIN?

71
00:04:47,748 --> 00:04:48,781
- YES! YES!

72
00:04:48,815 --> 00:04:49,681
NOW HURRY, PLEASE!

73
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:50,781
THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE.

74
00:04:50,815 --> 00:04:54,115
MOMO THE BULL
WILL TAKE YOU RIGHT
TO TOTOSAI'S HOME.

75
00:04:54,148 --> 00:04:55,548
- RIGHT.

76
00:04:55,581 --> 00:04:57,315
BYE FOR NOW.

77
00:05:00,215 --> 00:05:04,181
- AND YOU ARE CERTAIN
THAT INUYASHA WENT THROUGH
A TRANSFORMATION?

78
00:05:04,215 --> 00:05:05,481
- MM-HMM.

79
00:05:05,515 --> 00:05:08,681
DOES IT HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH THE TETSUSAIGA
GETTING BROKEN?

80
00:05:08,715 --> 00:05:10,048
- IT DOES.

81
00:05:10,081 --> 00:05:11,381
AS YOU ARE AWARE,

82
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:15,448
TETSUSAIGA IS AN HEIRLOOM
THAT WAS LEFT TO INUYASHA
BY HIS FATHER.

83
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,715
THE SWORD PROTECTS HIM
FROM HIS ENEMIES,

84
00:05:18,748 --> 00:05:20,048
BUT IT HAS A SECOND PURPOSE:

85
00:05:20,081 --> 00:05:23,348
KEEPING THE DEMON INSIDE
LOCKED UP.

86
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:24,281
- [GASPS]

87
00:05:24,315 --> 00:05:26,415
- IT KEEPS THE DEMON
LOCKED INSIDE INUYASHA?

88
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:28,748
- INUYASHA'S DEATH
IS INEVITABLE

89
00:05:28,781 --> 00:05:31,748
ONCE TETSUSAIGA IS BROKEN.

90
00:05:33,348 --> 00:05:40,748
HIS STRONG DESIRE TO LIVE
AWAKENED THE DEMON BLOOD
THAT FLOWS IN HIS VEINS.

91
00:05:40,781 --> 00:05:42,615
- HMM.

92
00:05:42,648 --> 00:05:45,148
- AND EVEN AFTER
TETSUSAIGA IS REPAIRED,

93
00:05:45,181 --> 00:05:49,981
THAT DEMON PART OF INUYASHA
WILL BE EVEN HARDER TO CONTROL

94
00:05:50,015 --> 00:05:52,515
BECAUSE NOW
HE HAS TASTED THE PLEASURE

95
00:05:52,548 --> 00:05:54,681
OF BRUTALLY SLAYING AN ENEMY.

96
00:05:54,715 --> 00:05:57,681
- DOES THAT MEAN
HIS HEART IS BEING TAKEN OVER

97
00:05:57,715 --> 00:06:00,648
BY THE DEMON IN HIM?

98
00:06:00,681 --> 00:06:03,081
- YOU IDIOT!

99
00:06:10,948 --> 00:06:13,181
- INUYASHA.

100
00:06:14,648 --> 00:06:18,181
[SOBBING]

101
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:27,148
- ONLY A SIMPLETON
WOULD ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN.

102
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:27,881
- HMPH.

103
00:06:27,915 --> 00:06:29,548
- WHAT HAS THIS FOOL
DONE TO YOU,

104
00:06:29,581 --> 00:06:31,715
MY PRECIOUS TETSUSAIGA?

105
00:06:31,748 --> 00:06:32,748
- YEAH, YEAH.

106
00:06:32,781 --> 00:06:36,281
NOW CAN YOU STOP BAWLING
AND START FIXING MY SWORD?

107
00:06:36,315 --> 00:06:37,648
- LISTEN, YOUNGSTER,

108
00:06:37,681 --> 00:06:39,681
IT'S NOT QUITE THAT SIMPLE.

109
00:06:39,715 --> 00:06:40,348
- HUH?

110
00:06:40,381 --> 00:06:41,315
YOU MEAN YOU CAN'T FIX IT?

111
00:06:41,348 --> 00:06:44,015
- I AM A MASTER SWORDSMITH.

112
00:06:44,048 --> 00:06:47,081
I CAN REPAIR IT
OVER THE COURSE OF 3 DAYS,

113
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:49,915
BUT I'LL REQUIRE
SOMETHING TO BOND IT.

114
00:06:49,948 --> 00:06:50,748
- LIKE WHAT?

115
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:54,181
- OPEN UP FOR ME,
WOULD YOU, INUYASHA?

116
00:06:54,215 --> 00:06:55,081
- HMM?

117
00:06:55,115 --> 00:06:56,215
HOW'S THIS?

118
00:06:56,248 --> 00:07:01,015
AAH!

119
00:07:01,948 --> 00:07:05,748
- WELL, THIS FANG
WILL HAVE TO DO.

120
00:07:05,781 --> 00:07:07,381
- WHAT DID YOU DO THAT FOR?

121
00:07:07,415 --> 00:07:08,381
- QUIT YOUR WHINING.

122
00:07:08,415 --> 00:07:12,581
YOUR TOOTH WILL GROW BACK
IN A MERE HALF A DAY.

123
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:13,715
- GOOD.

124
00:07:13,748 --> 00:07:16,248
YOU'RE GETTING
TO BE A REAL PAIN
IN THE NECK, OLD MAN.

125
00:07:16,281 --> 00:07:16,981
YOU'VE GOT 3 DAYS

126
00:07:17,015 --> 00:07:19,081
TO BRING ME
MY REPAIRED SWORD.

127
00:07:19,115 --> 00:07:21,048
- WHY DO I HAVE JUST 3 DAYS?

128
00:07:21,081 --> 00:07:25,948
- BECAUSE THAT'S HOW LONG
YOU SAID YOU'D NEED TO FIX IT.

129
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:27,415
- AHH.

130
00:07:27,448 --> 00:07:28,081
- YEAH.

131
00:07:28,115 --> 00:07:30,448
I'M COUNTING ON YOU,
OLD MAN.

132
00:07:30,481 --> 00:07:31,348
LATER.

133
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:32,048
- GOOD-BYE.

134
00:07:32,081 --> 00:07:34,615
I PROMISE NOT
TO LET YOU DOWN.

135
00:07:44,315 --> 00:07:46,281
- AHH.

136
00:07:53,881 --> 00:07:55,948
WHO ARE YOU?

137
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:00,415
- YOU ARE KAIJINBO,
I TAKE IT--

138
00:08:00,448 --> 00:08:03,748
THE SMITH WHO FORGED
TOO MANY DEVIANT SWORDS

139
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:06,981
AND WAS BANISHED BY
HIS MASTER TOTOSAI.

140
00:08:07,015 --> 00:08:08,215
- TOTOSAI, YOU SAY?

141
00:08:08,248 --> 00:08:13,715
THE SOUND OF HIS NAME
IS STILL ENOUGH
TO MAKE MY BLOOD BOIL.

142
00:08:13,748 --> 00:08:15,648
- HOW ABOUT IT, KAIJINBO?

143
00:08:15,681 --> 00:08:17,615
I WOULD HAVE YOU
FORGE A SWORD FOR ME

144
00:08:17,648 --> 00:08:20,215
WITH THE FANGS
OF THIS DEMON.

145
00:08:21,648 --> 00:08:22,881
- DON'T TAKE ME
FOR A FOOL.

146
00:08:22,915 --> 00:08:28,048
I CANNOT MAKE A SWORD
FROM SOMETHING
THAT IS ALREADY DEAD.

147
00:08:29,915 --> 00:08:33,615
- IS LORD SESSHOMARU
GOING TO USE TENSEIGA,

148
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:35,715
THE SWORD OF HEALING?

149
00:08:40,148 --> 00:08:43,881
- I CAN SEE THE MESSENGERS
FROM THE NETHERWORLD.

150
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:56,215
- THE DEMON'S HEAD
HAS COME BACK TO LIFE.

151
00:08:56,248 --> 00:09:00,281
- ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN SOMETHING,
KAIJINBO.

152
00:09:00,315 --> 00:09:01,515
- THIS SWORD TENSEIGA

153
00:09:01,548 --> 00:09:04,348
WAS FORGED BY THE SAME MASTER
WHO BANISHED YOU SOME TIME AGO,

154
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:08,348
AND THE FANGS OF THE DEMON
I LAID HERE BEFORE YOU
BROKE TETSUSAIGA,

155
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:13,015
A SWORD THAT WAS
ALSO FORGED BY TOTOSAI.

156
00:09:13,048 --> 00:09:13,981
- INCREDIBLE.

157
00:09:14,015 --> 00:09:17,815
- YES, THESE FANGS
WILL FORM A POWERFUL SWORD.

158
00:09:19,881 --> 00:09:24,315
- TETSUSAIGA SHOULD BE
FIXED BY TOMORROW
IF WE'RE LUCKY.

159
00:09:24,615 --> 00:09:27,281
- THIS COULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED
AT A WORSE TIME.

160
00:09:27,315 --> 00:09:29,815
IT'S GONNA BE A LONG NIGHT.

161
00:09:30,915 --> 00:09:31,648
- DAMN HIM.

162
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,681
I WISH THAT TOTOSAI
WOULD HURRY UP

163
00:09:33,715 --> 00:09:34,815
AND BRING ME THE SWORD.

164
00:09:34,848 --> 00:09:38,915
- MY, HE LOOKS LIKE
AN ORDINARY HUMAN NOW.

165
00:09:38,948 --> 00:09:41,615
- I GUESS YOU DIDN'T KNOW THIS
ABOUT INUYASHA.

166
00:09:41,648 --> 00:09:42,915
I HAVE HEARD
THIS HAPPENED TO HIM,

167
00:09:42,948 --> 00:09:46,715
BUT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I'VE ACTUALLY SEEN IT MYSELF.

168
00:09:46,748 --> 00:09:49,481
YOU SEE, HALF-DEMONS
SUCH AND INUYASHA

169
00:09:49,515 --> 00:09:51,915
LOSE THEIR DEMON POWERS
ON ONE GIVEN NIGHT

170
00:09:51,948 --> 00:09:54,081
WHEN THEY BECOME MERE MORTALS.

171
00:09:54,115 --> 00:09:55,215
LOOK HERE.

172
00:09:55,248 --> 00:09:56,381
NO FANGS, AS YOU SEE.

173
00:09:56,415 --> 00:09:58,215
VERY INTERESTING,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

174
00:09:58,248 --> 00:10:03,148
- COULD YOU GET YOUR KICKS
SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN IN MY FACE?

175
00:10:03,181 --> 00:10:04,081
- MY APOLOGIES.

176
00:10:04,115 --> 00:10:06,881
IF A HALF-DEMON
IS ATTACKED ON SUCH A NIGHT,

177
00:10:06,915 --> 00:10:07,948
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER.

178
00:10:07,981 --> 00:10:10,548
SO THE NIGHTS THAT
INUYASHA LOSES HIS POWERS

179
00:10:10,581 --> 00:10:12,381
MUST BE KEPT
STRICTLY SECRET.

180
00:10:12,415 --> 00:10:16,981
- AND HOW IS IT THAT
YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS, MIROKU?

181
00:10:18,781 --> 00:10:20,748
SHIPPO, IT WAS YOU!

182
00:10:20,781 --> 00:10:21,715
- LET GO!

183
00:10:21,748 --> 00:10:22,748
THAT HURTS!

184
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:23,948
- YOU BLABBERMOUTH.

185
00:10:23,981 --> 00:10:26,648
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT YOU'D GO AROUND
TELLING EVERYONE.

186
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,748
- I DIDN'T MEAN
TO DO ANY HARM.

187
00:10:28,781 --> 00:10:32,281
- THAT SHOULD GO WITHOUT SAYING,
SHOULDN'T IT?

188
00:10:32,315 --> 00:10:33,181
- DAMN.

189
00:10:33,215 --> 00:10:35,148
THIS IS GREAT.

190
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,681
EVERY TIME I TURN AROUND,

191
00:10:36,715 --> 00:10:39,748
MORE PEOPLE KNOW
ABOUT MY LITTLE SECRET.

192
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:41,315
- SO WHAT?

193
00:10:41,348 --> 00:10:45,481
IT ONLY PROVES
YOU HAVE MORE FRIENDS
THAN BEFORE.

194
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,881
- WHEN I TURN MORTAL LIKE THIS,

195
00:10:50,915 --> 00:10:54,015
I'M OVERCOME BY
STRONG HUMAN EMOTIONS.

196
00:10:54,048 --> 00:10:56,081
IT'LL BE GOOD RIDDANCE
TO THOSE FEELINGS

197
00:10:56,115 --> 00:10:59,315
ONCE I BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

198
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:02,081
- INUYASHA?

199
00:11:02,115 --> 00:11:04,748
- THEN AGAIN,
IF I DO BECOME A TRUE DEMON,

200
00:11:04,781 --> 00:11:07,715
HOW WILL I REACT
TO KAGOME AND THE OTHERS?

201
00:11:07,748 --> 00:11:09,748
- HERE.

202
00:11:11,081 --> 00:11:12,248
YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T WANDER

203
00:11:12,281 --> 00:11:15,415
TOO FAR AWAY FROM US TONIGHT
IF I WERE YOU.

204
00:11:15,448 --> 00:11:16,348
- HUH.

205
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,215
SPARE ME.

206
00:11:17,248 --> 00:11:19,648
EVERYBODY NEEDS
A LITTLE TIME TO THINK,

207
00:11:19,681 --> 00:11:22,881
AND I'M NO EXCEPTION.

208
00:11:22,915 --> 00:11:24,581
- WHAT'S WITH YOU?

209
00:11:24,615 --> 00:11:27,248
- INUYASHA,
DO YOU STILL INTEND

210
00:11:27,281 --> 00:11:30,215
TO BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON?

211
00:11:30,248 --> 00:11:32,748
YOU REALLY SCARED ME
THE OTHER DAY.

212
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:36,015
- YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN SCARED
OF THE DEMON.

213
00:11:36,048 --> 00:11:37,815
IF I HADN'T
TRANSFORMED WHEN I DID,

214
00:11:37,848 --> 00:11:41,581
YOU ALL WOULD HAVE
BEEN SLAUGHTERED BY GOSHINKI.

215
00:11:43,548 --> 00:11:44,448
- YOU DON'T GET IT.

216
00:11:44,481 --> 00:11:47,048
I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT HOW YOUR FACE CHANGED

217
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,681
OR HOW WE WERE IN DANGER...

218
00:11:48,715 --> 00:11:50,981
- DID I REALLY LOOK
THAT TERRIFYING?

219
00:11:51,015 --> 00:11:53,315
- IT'S JUST--
WHAT SCARED ME THE MOST

220
00:11:53,348 --> 00:11:57,581
WAS THAT IT FELT
LIKE YOU WERE SUDDENLY
OUT OF MY REACH.

221
00:11:57,881 --> 00:12:02,081
I COULDN'T HELP THINKING
THAT YOU WOULD FORGET ABOUT ME.

222
00:12:02,115 --> 00:12:03,981
THAT'S ALL.

223
00:12:04,015 --> 00:12:06,715
- WHEN I TRANSFORMED
THE OTHER DAY,

224
00:12:06,748 --> 00:12:09,315
MY HEART WAS--

225
00:12:09,348 --> 00:12:10,115
COME ON.

226
00:12:10,148 --> 00:12:11,848
DON'T BE SO STUPID.

227
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:14,581
I'M STILL THE SAME GUY
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TO ME.

228
00:12:14,615 --> 00:12:18,948
I WOULDN'T FORGET
ABOUT YOU OR MIROKU
AND THE OTHERS.

229
00:12:18,981 --> 00:12:21,515
- MM-HMM.

230
00:12:21,548 --> 00:12:22,648
DON'T FORGET US.

231
00:12:22,681 --> 00:12:25,848
PLEASE DON'T FORGET US,
INUYASHA.

232
00:12:26,881 --> 00:12:30,815
- KAIJINBO,
3 DAYS HAVE PASSED.

233
00:12:30,848 --> 00:12:35,681
HAVE YOU COMPLETED
FORGING THE SWORD
FROM THE DEMON'S FANGS?

234
00:12:41,548 --> 00:12:43,281
- YES.

235
00:12:43,315 --> 00:12:45,348
IT'S DONE.

236
00:12:45,381 --> 00:12:48,681
A MAGNIFICENT DEMON SWORD.

237
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,029
- THIS MUST BE THE WORK
OF KAIJINBO.

238
00:13:17,562 --> 00:13:20,062
- I'M ALIVE.

239
00:13:20,095 --> 00:13:22,162
BUT HOW CAN THAT BE?

240
00:13:22,195 --> 00:13:24,895
WASN'T I DRAWN IN HALF?

241
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:26,595
I KNEW IT.

242
00:13:26,629 --> 00:13:28,362
- LET'S GO, JAKEN.

243
00:13:28,395 --> 00:13:30,229
PULL YOURSELF TOGETHER QUICKLY.

244
00:13:30,262 --> 00:13:31,529
- MY LORD.

245
00:13:31,562 --> 00:13:38,284
IS IT POSSIBLE
THAT YOU REVIVED ME
WITH YOUR TENSEIGA?

246
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:42,439
- WHO OTHER IS CAPABLE
OF BRINGING SOMEONE BACK
FROM THE DEAD?

247
00:13:42,472 --> 00:13:44,606
- NO ONE, MY LORD.

248
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,172
- HAS KAIJINBO
COMPLETED MY SWORD?

249
00:13:47,206 --> 00:13:48,339
- YES, LORD SESSHOMARU.

250
00:13:48,372 --> 00:13:52,606
HE HAS FORGED A SWORD
FROM THE FANGS
OF THE SLAIN DEMON.

251
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,339
BUT I MUST ADD THAT HIS EYES
HAVE BECOME MOST FEARFUL,

252
00:13:57,372 --> 00:13:58,339
ALMOST AS IF--

253
00:13:58,372 --> 00:14:02,406
AS IF HE HAS BEEN POSSESSED
BY THE SWORD ITSELF.

254
00:14:02,439 --> 00:14:03,306
- HMM.

255
00:14:03,339 --> 00:14:04,906
INTERESTING.

256
00:14:09,172 --> 00:14:10,706
- INUYASHA?

257
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:13,339
PERHAPS YOU SHOULD
GET SOME SLEEP.

258
00:14:13,372 --> 00:14:14,372
- MIROKU--

259
00:14:14,406 --> 00:14:16,739
AWW, COME OFF IT.

260
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:17,506
LEAVE ME ALONE.

261
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:18,472
I'VE NEVER ONCE GONE TO SLEEP

262
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:21,306
WHILE I WAS TRANSFORMED
INTO A MORTAL.

263
00:14:21,339 --> 00:14:24,239
- TOO SCARED
TO GO TO SLEEP?

264
00:14:26,695 --> 00:14:27,995
- OH, I'M SCARED.

265
00:14:28,029 --> 00:14:28,729
SO WHAT?

266
00:14:28,762 --> 00:14:30,862
- AS LONG AS
YOU'RE BEING HONEST.

267
00:14:30,895 --> 00:14:32,729
- A LOT OF ENEMIES
ARE AFTER ME.

268
00:14:32,762 --> 00:14:35,195
IF ANY OF THEM ATTACK ME
WHEN I'M HUMAN LIKE THIS,

269
00:14:35,229 --> 00:14:36,895
I DON'T STAND
A CHANCE IN HELL.

270
00:14:36,929 --> 00:14:38,229
- THERE MIGHT JUST BE
A LESSON

271
00:14:38,262 --> 00:14:41,062
FOR YOU TO LEARN
FROM ALL THIS.

272
00:14:41,095 --> 00:14:42,295
HMM?

273
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:43,262
- MIROKU?

274
00:14:43,295 --> 00:14:44,962
SOMETHING IN THE AIR.

275
00:14:44,995 --> 00:14:46,695
- MM-HMM.

276
00:14:46,729 --> 00:14:48,862
- AN EVIL AURA.

277
00:15:11,195 --> 00:15:13,129
- WHICH ONE IS INUYASHA?

278
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,462
- WHY? WHO WANTS TO KNOW?

279
00:15:16,729 --> 00:15:18,262
- MY NAME IS KAIJINBO.

280
00:15:18,295 --> 00:15:20,129
I'M A SWORDSMITH.

281
00:15:20,162 --> 00:15:21,262
- A SWORDSMITH?

282
00:15:21,295 --> 00:15:23,395
- I FORGED THIS SWORD,
THE TOKIJIN,

283
00:15:23,429 --> 00:15:28,595
AND NOW IT CRIES
FOR A TASTE OF THE BLOOD
OF INUYASHA.

284
00:15:28,629 --> 00:15:32,462
- WHY HAS THIS SMITH
COME AFTER ME?

285
00:15:34,562 --> 00:15:36,762
- SO YOU ARE INUYASHA.

286
00:15:36,795 --> 00:15:39,495
THE SWORD HAS TAUGHT ME SO.

287
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:40,729
DISAPPOINTING.

288
00:15:40,762 --> 00:15:42,029
I EXPECTED A DEMON,

289
00:15:42,062 --> 00:15:44,129
AND YET I AM FACED
WITH A MERE MORTAL.

290
00:15:44,162 --> 00:15:49,462
- INUYASHA, HAVE YOU EVER
WRONGED THIS SWORDSMITH
THAT YOU KNOW OF?

291
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:50,562
- NO.

292
00:15:50,595 --> 00:15:52,795
- YOU HEARD THE MAN.

293
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:53,762
- AS I TOLD YOU,

294
00:15:53,795 --> 00:15:56,195
IT IS THE SWORD
THAT THIRSTS FOR HIS BLOOD.

295
00:15:56,229 --> 00:16:01,729
TOKIJIN WAS FORGED
FROM THE FANGS OF THE DEMON
THAT BROKE YOUR TETSUSAIGA,

296
00:16:01,762 --> 00:16:06,395
THE SWORD THAT WAS CREATED
BY OLD TOTOSAI.

297
00:16:06,429 --> 00:16:07,395
- HUH?

298
00:16:07,429 --> 00:16:08,895
HE USED GOSHINKI'S FANGS?

299
00:16:08,929 --> 00:16:11,862
THE SAME MONSTER
THAT BIT MY SWORD IN HALF?

300
00:16:11,895 --> 00:16:12,929
- IN OTHER WORDS,

301
00:16:12,962 --> 00:16:15,229
THE SWORD IS FILLED
WITH GOSHINKI'S HATRED FOR YOU.

302
00:16:15,262 --> 00:16:15,962
- HUH.

303
00:16:15,995 --> 00:16:17,862
I'VE HEARD EVERYTHING
I NEED TO.

304
00:16:17,895 --> 00:16:20,595
PREPARE YOURSELF, KAIJINBO.

305
00:16:20,629 --> 00:16:22,862
I'LL HACK YOU TO PIECES.

306
00:16:22,895 --> 00:16:24,695
- ESCAPE WHILE YOU CAN,
INUYASHA.

307
00:16:24,729 --> 00:16:27,495
- SANGO AND I
WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS DEMON.

308
00:16:27,529 --> 00:16:29,529
- YOU DON'T STAND A CHANCE
RIGHT NOW.

309
00:16:29,562 --> 00:16:31,862
- DO AS THEY SAY, INUYASHA.

310
00:16:31,895 --> 00:16:33,262
- DAMN.

311
00:16:33,295 --> 00:16:35,895
- HIRAIKOTSU!

312
00:16:36,895 --> 00:16:39,895
- PITY ABOUT YOUR POOR AIM.

313
00:16:50,562 --> 00:16:51,362
[GASPS]

314
00:16:51,395 --> 00:16:53,562
- SANGO'S WEAPON.

315
00:17:01,568 --> 00:17:02,568
- [CHUCKLES]

316
00:17:02,601 --> 00:17:03,435
YOU FOOL.

317
00:17:03,468 --> 00:17:05,768
- I'LL ADMIT YOUR SWORD
IS FORMIDABLE...

318
00:17:05,801 --> 00:17:09,735
WHICH IS WHY
I'LL HAVE TO RESORT TO THIS.

319
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:14,068
FAREWELL!

320
00:17:20,335 --> 00:17:21,168
- HE DID IT.

321
00:17:21,201 --> 00:17:21,968
- AND HERE ALL ALONG

322
00:17:22,001 --> 00:17:24,001
I THOUGHT
THAT MIROKU'S ONLY WEAPON

323
00:17:24,035 --> 00:17:25,168
WAS HIS WIND TUNNEL.

324
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:28,068
HE DOES HAVE SPIRITUAL POWERS.

325
00:17:32,668 --> 00:17:35,401
- BEHIND YOU, MIROKU!

326
00:17:43,968 --> 00:17:47,635
- TOKIJIN IS INVINCIBLE.

327
00:17:47,668 --> 00:17:49,768
NO SWORD CAN MATCH IT.

328
00:17:49,801 --> 00:17:54,301
MY ENEMY ISN'T KAIJINBO,
IT'S THE SWORD.

329
00:17:54,335 --> 00:17:55,201
- [CACKLING]

330
00:17:55,235 --> 00:17:56,635
PLAYTIME IS OVER.

331
00:17:56,668 --> 00:17:58,168
- HE'S ACTING
AS IF NOTHING HAPPENED,

332
00:17:58,201 --> 00:17:59,401
EVEN THOUGH
HIS HEAD IS SPLIT OPEN.

333
00:17:59,435 --> 00:18:04,401
- YEAH, ALMOST AS IF
HE'S CONTROLLED
BY THE TOKIJIN SWORD.

334
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:06,868
- COME FOR ME, INUYASHA,

335
00:18:06,901 --> 00:18:10,435
OR ARE YOU COMPLETELY
PARALYZED BY FEAR?

336
00:18:10,468 --> 00:18:14,668
WILL YOU RUN AND HIDE
LIKE A CHILD?

337
00:18:15,068 --> 00:18:18,268
- INUYASHA,
DON'T LET HIM LURE YOU
INTO BATTLE.

338
00:18:18,301 --> 00:18:21,001
- I'M NOT GONNA FALL
FOR ANY TRICKS LIKE THAT.

339
00:18:21,035 --> 00:18:26,601
THE THING IS
THAT I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT HE'S COME AFTER...

340
00:18:26,635 --> 00:18:29,568
AND I'M NOT GONNA
RUN AWAY AND HIDE.

341
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:30,501
- INUYASHA!

342
00:18:30,535 --> 00:18:34,168
- WHY DOES HE ALWAYS
HAVE TO BE SO STUBBORN?

343
00:18:40,668 --> 00:18:43,268
- [MOO]

344
00:18:43,301 --> 00:18:44,101
- TOTOSAI.

345
00:18:44,135 --> 00:18:45,501
- HAVE YOU REPAIRED
THE TETSUSAIGA?

346
00:18:45,535 --> 00:18:49,335
- I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN
YOU HAD SOMETHING TO DO
WITH ALL THIS COMMOTION.

347
00:18:49,368 --> 00:18:52,268
- YOU'RE LATE,
OR MAYBE YOU HADN'T NOTICED.

348
00:18:52,301 --> 00:18:54,001
THANK YOU.

349
00:18:55,268 --> 00:18:56,568
- MASTER, DON'T DO IT.

350
00:18:56,601 --> 00:18:57,735
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

351
00:18:57,768 --> 00:18:58,935
- TETSUSAIGA WILL NOT TRANSFORM

352
00:18:58,968 --> 00:19:02,735
WHEN YOU ARE IN YOUR HUMAN FORM
WITHOUT YOUR DEMONIC POWERS.

353
00:19:02,768 --> 00:19:05,801
- IT'S BEEN A LONG TIME
SINCE WE MET, KAIJINBO.

354
00:19:05,835 --> 00:19:08,501
- I TOOK YOU FOR DEAD,
TOTOSAI.

355
00:19:08,535 --> 00:19:11,668
- YOU'VE BEEN BUSY
CRAFTING ANOTHER WICKED SWORD,

356
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,835
HAVEN'T YOU, KAIJINBO?

357
00:19:13,868 --> 00:19:17,668
- TOTOSAI, I SHALL PROVE TO YOU
WITHOUT A DOUBT

358
00:19:17,701 --> 00:19:20,535
WHICH OF US
IS THE BETTER SWORDSMITH.

359
00:19:20,568 --> 00:19:21,768
- TOTOSAI, TELL ME,

360
00:19:21,801 --> 00:19:23,968
ARE YOU FAMILIAR
WITH THIS KAIJINBO PERSON?

361
00:19:24,001 --> 00:19:26,135
- YES. HE WAS ONCE
MY DISCIPLE.

362
00:19:26,168 --> 00:19:28,635
I BANISHED HIM
A LONG TIME AGO.

363
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,235
HE WAS MOST UNORTHODOX.

364
00:19:30,268 --> 00:19:33,668
HE KILLED 10 INNOCENT CHILDREN
FOR HIS SWORD.

365
00:19:33,701 --> 00:19:34,901
WHAT A WRETCHED BEAST.

366
00:19:34,935 --> 00:19:38,135
HE COVERED THE BLADE
WITH HUMAN BLOOD AND OIL

367
00:19:38,168 --> 00:19:41,068
IN ORDER TO MAKE IT
SEETHE WITH HATRED.

368
00:19:41,101 --> 00:19:43,101
- DRAW YOUR SWORD, INUYASHA.

369
00:19:43,135 --> 00:19:45,835
I SHALL CRUSH
TOTOSAI'S CREATION

370
00:19:45,868 --> 00:19:48,268
BEFORE HIS VERY EYES.

371
00:19:48,301 --> 00:19:49,001
- HUH.

372
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,001
I WON'T WASTE ANY TIME

373
00:19:50,035 --> 00:19:52,568
DOING YOU
AND THAT SWORD OF YOURS IN.

374
00:19:52,601 --> 00:19:54,168
- MASTER TOTOSAI,

375
00:19:54,201 --> 00:19:56,235
I HOPE THAT YOU'VE MADE
THE TETSUSAIGA

376
00:19:56,268 --> 00:19:59,201
EVEN STRONGER
THAN IT WAS BEFORE.

377
00:19:59,235 --> 00:20:00,468
- PERHAPS A LITTLE.

378
00:20:00,501 --> 00:20:01,935
- A LITTLE ISN'T ENOUGH.

379
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,235
- KAIJINBO'S SWORD
IS FORGED FROM THE FANG

380
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:06,601
OF THE DEMON
THAT BROKE TETSUSAIGA.

381
00:20:06,635 --> 00:20:08,268
- HMM.

382
00:20:17,368 --> 00:20:19,101
- INUYASHA!

383
00:20:22,368 --> 00:20:23,068
- [CACKLES]

384
00:20:23,101 --> 00:20:25,935
THIS WILL PUT AN END TO YOU.

385
00:20:33,668 --> 00:20:35,468
- THAT'S A RELIEF,
TETSUSAIGA.

386
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:39,068
YOU SEEM EVER MORE POWERFUL
THAN BEFORE.

387
00:20:39,101 --> 00:20:40,235
- IT DIDN'T BREAK.

388
00:20:40,268 --> 00:20:40,968
- NOPE.

389
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,068
DIDN'T EXPECT IT WOULD.

390
00:20:42,101 --> 00:20:44,268
- BUT HE'S TOO WEAK
TO HANDLE IT.

391
00:20:44,301 --> 00:20:48,035
- YOUR BODY WILL GIVE IN
LONG BEFORE YOUR SWORD DOES.

392
00:20:48,068 --> 00:20:50,435
- SORRY TO DISAPPOINT YOU,
KAIJINBO.

393
00:20:50,468 --> 00:20:53,135
THAT SWORD OF YOURS
MAY BE PRETTY STRONG,

394
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,068
BUT YOU'RE NOT NEARLY
SKILLED ENOUGH TO WIELD IT.

395
00:20:56,101 --> 00:21:00,268
YOU SHOULD HAVE KILLED ME
WHILE YOU HAD THE CHANCE...

396
00:21:05,101 --> 00:21:07,868
BEFORE I BECAME
A DEMON AGAIN.

397
00:21:07,901 --> 00:21:09,768
- HE'S TRANSFORMING BACK.

398
00:21:09,801 --> 00:21:12,035
- THE SUN'S COMING UP.

399
00:21:12,968 --> 00:21:16,001
- I'M GONNA TEST
TETSUSAIGA'S NEW BLADE

400
00:21:16,035 --> 00:21:18,201
AND YOU'RE FIRST.

401
00:21:26,568 --> 00:21:29,668
HEY, TOTOSAI,
WHAT THE HELL HAVE YOU DONE

402
00:21:29,701 --> 00:21:31,968
TO MY TETSUSAIGA,
YOU OLD CODGER?

403
00:21:32,001 --> 00:21:34,335
ANSWER ME, OLD MAN.

404
00:21:34,368 --> 00:21:37,168
WHAT DID YOU DO TO MY SWORD?

405
00:21:37,201 --> 00:21:39,835
- WHAT? ARE YOU HAVING
SOME KIND OF PROBLEM?

406
00:21:39,868 --> 00:21:41,335
- AS IF YOU HADN'T NOTICED.

407
00:21:41,368 --> 00:21:43,335
WHY IS THIS THING SO HEAVY?

408
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:46,068
- OH, IT MUST
HAVE SOMETHING TO DO

409
00:21:46,101 --> 00:21:48,435
WITH THAT FANG
OF YOURS I USED.

410
00:21:48,468 --> 00:21:50,368
PAY NO MIND.

411
00:21:51,368 --> 00:21:54,001
- NO GOOD HAVING A SWORD
YOU CAN'T EVEN HOLD.

412
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:57,535
I'LL SLICE YOU IN HALF,
INUYASHA.

413
00:21:58,668 --> 00:22:01,001
- YOU MIGHT WANT
TO RAISE YOUR SWORD.

414
00:22:01,035 --> 00:22:02,801
- THAT'S THE WHOLE PROBLEM.

415
00:22:02,835 --> 00:22:05,535
- DAMN THAT OLD MAN.

416
00:22:27,401 --> 00:22:31,135
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

417
00:23:56,325 --> 00:24:00,024
- TOKIJIN, A SWORD FORGED
WITH GOSHINKI'S HATRED,

418
00:24:00,058 --> 00:24:01,958
POSSESSES
THE SWORDSMITH KAIJINBO.

419
00:24:01,991 --> 00:24:05,458
THE POWERFUL WEAPON
IS WIELDED AGAINST INUYASHA,

420
00:24:05,491 --> 00:24:08,158
AND LATER
ITS TRUE OWNER SHOWS UP.

421
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:11,058
SESSHOMARU,
INUYASHA'S BROTHER,

422
00:24:11,091 --> 00:24:11,958
TURNS TOKIJIN ON HIM,

423
00:24:11,991 --> 00:24:14,124
AS THOUGH TRYING
TO TEST SOMETHING.

424
00:24:14,158 --> 00:24:16,291
THEN KAGURA,
NARAKU'S INCARNATION,

425
00:24:16,324 --> 00:24:19,891
STEPS ON THE STAGE
TO REALLY HEAT THINGS UP.

426
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:22,991
NEXT TIME...

427
00:24:23,024 --> 00:24:24,024
SEE YOU SOON!
