>> IF I DIED ONE DAY,

522
00:21:11,758 --> 00:21:14,291
I WAS WONDERING, WOULD YOU--

523
00:21:14,291 --> 00:21:16,191
WOULD YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER ME?

524
00:21:16,191 --> 00:21:20,458
>> UH.

525
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:22,991

00:21:34,925 --> 00:21:36,491
>> DO YOU NEED TO ASK?

532
00:21:36,491 --> 00:21:39,491
I'M GOING TO FIND NARAKU.

533
00:21:39,491 --> 00:21:42,025
>> YES. OF COURSE YOU ARE.

534
00:21:42,025 --> 00:21:43,225
MAY I COME ALONG?

535
00:21:43,225 --> 00:21:44,458
I--I MEAN IF IT'S NOT TOO MUCH

536
00:21:44,458 --> 00:21:46,391
TROUBLE OR ANYTHING. HMM?

537
00:21:46,391 --> 00:21:47,991
>> YOU NEED TO ASK?

538
00:21:47,991 --> 00:21:48,958

00:23:59,289 --> 00:24:00,522
NEARBY, KIRARA

549
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:01,889
MEETS UP WITH KOHAKU.

550
00:24:01,889 --> 00:24:03,122
>> YOU WERE WORRIED ABOUT ME,

551
00:24:03,122 --> 00:24:04,156
KIRARA?

552
00:24:04,156 --> 00:24:05,156
THANKS.

553
00:24:05,156 --> 00:24:06,822
I STILL CAN'T COME BACK, THOUGH.

554
00:24:06,822 --> 00:24:08,222
>> KOHAKU HIDES THE FACT THAT

555
00:24:08,222 --> 00:24:09,556
HE'S RETURNED TO NORMAL,

556
00:24:09,556 --> 00:24:11,022
AND GOES AFTER NARAKU,

557
00:24:11,022 --> 00:24:12,922
AND SANGO IS FULL OF AFFECTION

558
00:24:12,922 --> 00:24:13,889
FOR HER BROTHER.

559
00:24:13,889 --> 00:24:15,256
ONLY KIRARA KNOWS

560
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:16,756
HOW THE SIBLINGS FEEL.

561
00:24:16,756 --> 00:24:18,456
NEXT TIME--KOHAKU,

562
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,889
SANGO, AND KIRARA.

563
00:24:19,889 --> 00:24:21,756
THE SECRET FLOWER GARDEN.

564
00:24:21,756 --> 00:24:22,856
>> KIRARA, WERE YOU

565
00:24:22,856 --> 00:24:24,856
HERE WITH KOHAKU?
