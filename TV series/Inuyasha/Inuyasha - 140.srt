>> A PRIEST LIKE YOU SHOULD BE

520
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,004
ABLE TO SEE THE BORDER BETWEEN

521
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:42,670
THIS LIFE AND THE NEXT.

522
00:23:42,670 --> 00:23:44,770
>> NEXT TIME, ENTEI, THE DEMON

523
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,070
HORSE UNLEASHED.

524
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:49,570
>> THAT'S JUST A STUPID HORSE.
