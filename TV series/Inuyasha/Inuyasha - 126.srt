HMM, A SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

176
00:08:06,828 --> 00:08:07,928
>> I WANT YOU TO IMPLANT THAT

177
00:08:07,928 --> 00:08:09,328
TAINTED SACRED JEWEL SHARD

178
00:08:09,328 --> 00:08:10,861
INTO KAGOME.

179
00:08:10,861 --> 00:08:12,328
ONCE IT IS IN, SHE WILL BE

180
00:08:12,328 --> 00:08:15,161
COMPLETELY UNDER OUR CONTROL.

181
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:17,795
MY MISSION HERE IS ALMOST DONE.

182
00:08:17,795 --> 00:08:18,861
IMPLANT THE SHARD, AND

183
00:08:18,861 --> 00:08:20,828
I SHALL GO INTO HIDING.

184
00:08:20,828 --> 00:08:22,161
>> HAH.

185
00:08:22,161 --> 00:08:23,928
WITH THIS, KAGOME WILL BECOME

186
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:25,570
NARAKU'S SLAVE, YOU SAY?

187
00:08:30,495 --> 00:08:31,528
SHE WILL SHARE THE SAME

188
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,628
FATE AS KOHAKU.

189
00:08:33,628 --> 00:08:34,628
>> KOHAKU?

190
00:08:34,628 --> 00:08:37,161
[GASPS]

191
00:08:37,161 --> 00:08:39,061
THIS IMPURE LIGHT.

192
00:08:39,061 --> 00:08:39,995
DOES SHE INTEND TO PLACE THAT

193
00:08:39,995 --> 00:08:42,161
SHARD INTO ME?

194
00:08:42,161 --> 00:08:43,195
NO!

195
00:08:43,195 --> 00:08:47,461
I--I CAN'T MOVE MY BODY.

196
00:08:47,461 --> 00:08:48,861
THIS STRANGE INFANT HAS A GRASP

197
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,361
ON MY SOUL.

198
00:08:52,361 --> 00:08:53,861
I HAVE TO BREAK FREE.

199
00:08:53,861 --> 00:08:55,028
I HAVE TO FREE MYSELF

200
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:57,395
FROM IT'S GRASP.

201
00:08:57,395 --> 00:08:59,061
>> KAGURA, HOLD ON.

202
00:08:59,061 --> 00:08:59,995
>> HMM?

203
00:08:59,995 --> 00:09:01,561
>> SHE'S A STUBBORN ONE.

204
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:04,128
SHE'S REGAINED CONSCIOUSNESS.

205
00:09:04,128 --> 00:09:06,295
>> INUYASHA!

206
00:09:06,295 --> 00:09:08,428
SAVE ME!

207
00:09:08,428 --> 00:09:09,595
>> IT'S USELESS.

208
00:09:09,595 --> 00:09:11,028
YOU MUST REALIZE BY NOW THAT HE

209
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,228
WON'T COME AND SAVE YOU.

210
00:09:13,228 --> 00:09:15,361
INUYASHA HAS MADE HIS CHOICE.

211
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:17,361
AND HE HAS CHOSEN KIKYO,

212
00:09:17,361 --> 00:09:19,061
NOT YOU.

213
00:09:19,061 --> 00:09:22,428
>> [GRUNTING]

214
00:09:22,428 --> 00:09:26,795
DAMMIT, I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

215
00:09:26,795 --> 00:09:28,361
HUH?

216
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:30,495
>> GO, INUYASHA.

217
00:09:30,495 --> 00:09:32,295
>> KAGOME?

218
00:09:32,295 --> 00:09:33,261
>> BUT, KAGOME--

219
00:09:33,261 --> 00:09:34,495
>> THIS IS NO TIME TO HESITATE,

220
00:09:34,495 --> 00:09:35,528
NOW HURRY.

221
00:09:35,528 --> 00:09:37,228
KIKYO MUST BE WAITING.

222
00:09:37,228 --> 00:09:39,169
>> HMM. YES.

223
00:09:43,595 --> 00:09:48,495
FORGIVE ME.

224
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:49,261
I'M MAKING THE SAME

225
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,461
MISTAKE AGAIN.

226
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:53,883
>> [GRUNTING]

227
00:10:13,695 --> 00:10:15,561
INUYASHA.

228
00:10:15,561 --> 00:10:17,161
>> I LOST KIKYO.

229
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:18,061
AND THEN I THOUGHT I WAS THE

230
00:10:18,061 --> 00:10:19,395
ONLY ONE HURTING,

231
00:10:19,395 --> 00:10:20,995
THEN ACTED SELFISHLY.

232
00:10:20,995 --> 00:10:22,061
NOW I'M ABOUT TO LOSE SOMEONE

233
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:23,995
ELSE WHO'S IMPORTANT TO ME.

234
00:10:23,995 --> 00:10:25,495
DAMMIT.

235
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,695
WAIT FOR ME, KAGOME.

236
00:10:26,695 --> 00:10:28,661
WAIT FOR ME UNTIL I GET THERE!

237
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:33,195
DON'T YOU DIE ON ME!

238
00:10:33,195 --> 00:10:34,895
>> REMEMBER, KAGOME, WHEN YOU

239
00:10:34,895 --> 00:10:37,495
LEARNED THAT KIKYO HAD DIED.

240
00:10:37,495 --> 00:10:39,095
WEREN'T YOU ACTUALLY

241
00:10:39,095 --> 00:10:41,495
QUITE PLEASED?

242
00:10:41,495 --> 00:10:42,595
THE WOMAN WHO CAME BETWEEN YOU

243
00:10:42,595 --> 00:10:44,161
WAS GONE.

244
00:10:44,161 --> 00:10:45,995
THE MOMENT INUYASHA HEARD THAT

245
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:46,861
KIKYO WAS ALIVE,

246
00:10:46,861 --> 00:10:50,328
HE WENT AFTER HER AGAIN.

247
00:10:50,328 --> 00:10:52,761
WHETHER SHE IS DEAD OR ALIVE,

248
00:10:52,761 --> 00:10:53,995
INUYASHA'S HEART BELONGS

249
00:10:53,995 --> 00:10:55,828
TO KIKYO.

250
00:10:55,828 --> 00:10:58,195
DON'T YOU FEEL BITTER TOWARDS

251
00:10:58,195 --> 00:10:59,795
INUYASHA?

252
00:10:59,795 --> 00:11:01,961
DON'T YOU HATE KIKYO?

253
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,095
IT'S OK TO FEEL HATRED.

254
00:11:04,095 --> 00:11:06,561
YOU ARE NOT WRONG TO HATE THEM.

255
00:11:06,561 --> 00:11:07,995
FILL YOUR HEART WITH BITTERNESS

256
00:11:07,995 --> 00:11:10,195
ONCE MORE...

257
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:13,216
AND LET ME GRASP YOUR SOUL.

258
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,262
>> YOU GOT HER.

259
00:11:41,862 --> 00:11:42,403
>> I FEEL BITTER TOWARD

260
00:11:42,403 --> 00:11:44,482
INUYASHA?

261
00:11:44,482 --> 00:11:46,949
I HATE KIKYO?

262
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:48,816
I GUESS I HAVE EVERY REASON TO,

263
00:11:48,816 --> 00:11:49,977
BUT...

264
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:57,916
>> WHAT'S GOING ON HERE,

265
00:11:57,916 --> 00:12:00,682
SOMEHOW SHE REPELLED THE SHARD.

266
00:12:00,682 --> 00:12:02,049
SO THERE ARE SOME THINGS EVEN

267
00:12:02,049 --> 00:12:04,516
THIS DEVILISH BRAT CAN'T DO.

268
00:12:04,516 --> 00:12:06,449
>> HUH?

269
00:12:06,449 --> 00:12:08,816
>> YOU'RE--YOU'RE WRONG.

270
00:12:08,816 --> 00:12:10,149
>> SHE SPOKE!

271
00:12:10,149 --> 00:12:11,516
MY SUGGESTIVE POWERS ARE NOT

272
00:12:11,516 --> 00:12:14,082
WORKING ON THIS GIRL.

273
00:12:14,082 --> 00:12:15,482
>> WHAT YOU ARE SAYING TO ME IS

274
00:12:15,482 --> 00:12:18,382
COMPLETELY WRONG.

275
00:12:18,382 --> 00:12:19,416
INUYASHA CAN'T FORGET

276
00:12:19,416 --> 00:12:21,116
ABOUT KIKYO.

277
00:12:21,116 --> 00:12:22,516
AND EVEN IF I CAN BRING MYSELF

278
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:24,349
TO ACCEPT THIS RATIONALLY,

279
00:12:24,349 --> 00:12:25,616
I STILL FEEL THE PAIN OF

280
00:12:25,616 --> 00:12:27,582
JEALOUSY IN MY HEART.

281
00:12:27,582 --> 00:12:30,149
HOWEVER, BEARING A GRUDGE

282
00:12:30,149 --> 00:12:32,316
AGAINST INUYASHA

283
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:33,616
AND FEELING JEALOUSY TOWARD

284
00:12:33,616 --> 00:12:35,582
KIKYO, THESE ARE NORMAL FEELINGS

285
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:38,782
THAT ANY HUMAN WOULD HAVE,

286
00:12:38,782 --> 00:12:40,082
AND IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT I

287
00:12:40,082 --> 00:12:41,316
SHOULD NECESSARILY FEEL

288
00:12:41,316 --> 00:12:43,682
BITTERNESS TOWARD THESE TWO.

289
00:12:43,682 --> 00:12:44,982
THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT

290
00:12:44,982 --> 00:12:46,949
INUYASHA HAS TRIED TO LEAVE ME,

291
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:47,949
BECAUSE HE KNEW HOW DIFFICULT

292
00:12:47,949 --> 00:12:53,749
ALL THIS WAS FOR ME.

293
00:12:53,749 --> 00:12:55,416
I'VE EVEN WISHED KIKYO GONE,

294
00:12:55,416 --> 00:12:56,782
BUT THEN I'VE ALWAYS FELT BAD

295
00:12:56,782 --> 00:12:58,149
AFTER FOR HARBORING SUCH

296
00:12:58,149 --> 00:13:00,149
THOUGHTS.

297
00:13:00,149 --> 00:13:02,349
I KNOW...ALL THESE FEELINGS...

298
00:13:02,349 --> 00:13:06,549
THEY MEAN...THAT I...

299
00:13:06,549 --> 00:13:07,882
THEY MEAN I'M IN LOVE WITH

300
00:13:07,882 --> 00:13:10,216
INUYASHA!

301
00:13:10,216 --> 00:13:12,149
>> KAGOME!

302
00:13:12,149 --> 00:13:13,549
UH.

303
00:13:13,549 --> 00:13:15,949
>> INUYASHA.

304
00:13:15,949 --> 00:13:18,282
YOU CAME FOR ME.

305
00:13:18,282 --> 00:13:20,016
>> KAGOME!

306
00:13:20,016 --> 00:13:22,682
KAGOME.

307
00:13:22,682 --> 00:13:24,616
>> NOW I SEE WHY NARAKU HATES

308
00:13:24,616 --> 00:13:25,882
THAT GIRL.

309
00:13:25,882 --> 00:13:26,949
>> WHY, YOU...

310
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:28,749
WHAT DID YOU DO TO KAGOME?

311
00:13:28,749 --> 00:13:31,616
>> I JUST RUMMAGED AROUND INSIDE

312
00:13:31,616 --> 00:13:33,882
HER SOUL A LITTLE BIT.

313
00:13:33,882 --> 00:13:35,316
BECAUSE YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET

314
00:13:35,316 --> 00:13:37,716
OVER KIKYO, I WAS ABLE TO FIND

315
00:13:37,716 --> 00:13:39,249
A TINY SPECK OF DARKNESS

316
00:13:39,249 --> 00:13:41,682
IN THAT GIRL'S HEART.

317
00:13:41,682 --> 00:13:43,149
IT'S TOO BAD.

318
00:13:43,149 --> 00:13:44,749
JUST ONE MORE LITTLE STEP, AND I

319
00:13:44,749 --> 00:13:46,616
COULD HAVE CRUSHED HER SOUL.

320
00:13:46,616 --> 00:13:47,682
>> BASTARD.

321
00:13:47,682 --> 00:13:49,616
JUST WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU?

322
00:13:49,616 --> 00:13:52,749
>> INUYASHA!

323
00:13:52,749 --> 00:13:53,882
>> TOOK YOU LONG ENOUGH.

324
00:13:53,882 --> 00:13:55,249
>> KAGOME, ARE YOU OK?

325
00:13:55,249 --> 00:13:56,882
>> KAGURA, KANNA.

326
00:13:56,882 --> 00:13:58,816
>> WHAT, YOU'RE STILL ALIVE?

327
00:13:58,816 --> 00:14:01,282
>> MONK AND DEMON SLAYER,

328
00:14:01,282 --> 00:14:02,849
TELL ME, HOW MANY OF THE

329
00:14:02,849 --> 00:14:04,782
SOLDIERS DID YOU KILL?

330
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:06,049
>> THIS INFANT,

331
00:14:06,049 --> 00:14:07,649
WAS HE MANIPULATING

332
00:14:07,649 --> 00:14:10,182
THE CASTLE SOLDIERS?

333
00:14:10,182 --> 00:14:11,416
HATE TO DISAPPOINT YOU,

334
00:14:11,416 --> 00:14:13,682
BUT WE DON'T KILL NEEDLESSLY.

335
00:14:13,682 --> 00:14:17,549
THIS BABY, THE GAS THE COLOR OF

336
00:14:17,549 --> 00:14:19,282
HIS SKIN.

337
00:14:19,282 --> 00:14:20,449
WAS HE CREATED FROM THE CLUMPS

338
00:14:20,449 --> 00:14:21,949
OF FLESH WHICH NARAKU WAS

339
00:14:21,949 --> 00:14:24,649
PRODUCING AT MOUNT HAKUREI?

340
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:25,816
TELL ME.

341
00:14:25,816 --> 00:14:28,082
ARE YOU NARAKU'S HUMAN HEART?

342
00:14:28,082 --> 00:14:29,982
>> WHY DO YOU THINK THAT?

343
00:14:29,982 --> 00:14:31,382
>> WE KNOW THAT NARAKU HID

344
00:14:31,382 --> 00:14:33,049
HIMSELF AT MOUNT HAKUREI IN

345
00:14:33,049 --> 00:14:34,216
ORDER TO CREATE A MORE

346
00:14:34,216 --> 00:14:35,716
POWERFUL BODY.

347
00:14:35,716 --> 00:14:38,116
ALSO, HE WANTED TO CAST AWAY HIS

348
00:14:38,116 --> 00:14:40,549
HUMAN HEART.

349
00:14:40,549 --> 00:14:41,682
NARAKU TOLD US HE CUT AWAY HIS

350
00:14:41,682 --> 00:14:43,282
HUMAN HEART, WHICH CONTINUED

351
00:14:43,282 --> 00:14:45,282
TO YEARN FOR KIKYO.

352
00:14:45,282 --> 00:14:48,182
THAT WAY, HE COULD SLAY HER.

353
00:14:48,182 --> 00:14:50,449
>> THIS BABY...IS NARAKU'S HEART

354
00:14:50,449 --> 00:14:52,916
WHICH YEARNS FOR KIKYO?

355
00:14:52,916 --> 00:14:54,816
IT'S ABSOLUTELY SICK!

356
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:56,482
THE UNDERHANDED WAYS NARAKU TOYS

357
00:14:56,482 --> 00:14:58,682
WITH PEOPLE'S EMOTIONS!

358
00:14:58,682 --> 00:14:59,949
>> [CHUCKLING]

359
00:14:59,949 --> 00:15:02,049
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY...

360
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:04,216
THAT I AM INDEED THE HUMAN HEART

361
00:15:04,216 --> 00:15:07,182
WHICH NARAKU ONCE POSSESSED.

362
00:15:07,182 --> 00:15:09,249
I CAN CLEARLY SEE INTO A

363
00:15:09,249 --> 00:15:10,816
PERSON'S HEART,

364
00:15:10,816 --> 00:15:12,749
THEIR WEAKNESSES AND FRAILTIES.

365
00:15:12,749 --> 00:15:14,149
I KNOW JUST WHAT TO DO

366
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:15,782
IN ORDER TO MAKE ONE SUFFER,

367
00:15:15,782 --> 00:15:18,782
TO FEEL SORROW OR HATE.

368
00:15:18,782 --> 00:15:21,082
THIS IS ALL FAMILIAR TO ME.

369
00:15:21,082 --> 00:15:23,616
BUT IF THERE IS ONE FEELING THAT

370
00:15:23,616 --> 00:15:25,849
I DID NOT INHERIT FROM NARAKU,

371
00:15:25,849 --> 00:15:27,349
IT IS THE ANGUISH AND

372
00:15:27,349 --> 00:15:32,482
YEARNING FOR KIKYO.

373
00:15:32,482 --> 00:15:33,349
AND WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT

374
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,282
FEELING WENT?

375
00:15:35,282 --> 00:15:36,682
THOSE DISGUSTING CLUMPS OF FLESH

376
00:15:36,682 --> 00:15:38,249
YOU SAW AT MOUNT HAKUREI,

377
00:15:38,249 --> 00:15:42,982
THAT'S WHERE.

378
00:15:42,982 --> 00:15:43,716
>> THAT WAS NARAKU'S

379
00:15:43,716 --> 00:15:46,116
ABANDONED HEART?

380
00:15:46,116 --> 00:15:48,182
>> AND THAT IS WHY I FEEL

381
00:15:48,182 --> 00:15:50,516
NEITHER PAIN NOR SORROW.

382
00:15:50,516 --> 00:15:52,016
>> HUH.

383
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,482
SO IN OTHER WORDS,

384
00:15:53,482 --> 00:15:54,816
YOU'RE JUST A MONSTER CREATED

385
00:15:54,816 --> 00:15:56,282
FROM NARAKU'S HEART,

386
00:15:56,282 --> 00:15:59,082
ALL TWISTED AND GROTESQUE.

387
00:15:59,082 --> 00:16:01,582
THAT'S ALL I NEED TO HEAR.

388
00:16:01,582 --> 00:16:03,916
NOW PREPARE TO DIE!

389
00:16:03,916 --> 00:16:09,916
AAH!

390
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:13,682
HUH?

391
00:16:13,682 --> 00:16:15,049
>> THIS INFANT,

392
00:16:15,049 --> 00:16:17,549
IT CAN CREATE A BARRIER?

393
00:16:17,549 --> 00:16:18,816
THIS IS THE WEIRDEST INFANT I'VE

394
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:21,382
EVER MET.

395
00:16:21,382 --> 00:16:22,416
>> MY WIND SCAR IS

396
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:27,216
BEING SUCKED UP!

397
00:16:27,216 --> 00:16:28,682
AAH!

398
00:16:28,682 --> 00:16:30,803
>> OH, NO, EVERYONE RUN!

399
00:16:35,449 --> 00:16:37,790
>> AAH!

400
00:16:43,916 --> 00:16:45,582
>> DAMN HIM.

401
00:16:45,582 --> 00:16:47,016
THAT BRAT, HE REPELLED

402
00:16:47,016 --> 00:16:51,249
MY WIND SCAR!

403
00:16:51,249 --> 00:16:53,282
>> HEH HEH HEH.

404
00:16:53,282 --> 00:16:54,316
DON'T THINK THIS IS OVER

405
00:16:54,316 --> 00:16:55,516
JUST YET.

406
00:16:55,516 --> 00:16:57,349
I'LL BE BACK SOON.

407
00:16:57,349 --> 00:16:59,082
>> SHUT UP, YOU BASTARD!

408
00:16:59,082 --> 00:17:00,349
IF YOU EVER TOUCH KAGOME

409
00:17:00,349 --> 00:17:02,416
AGAIN...

410
00:17:02,416 --> 00:17:04,382
>> NOW THAT THE PRIESTESS KIKYO

411
00:17:04,382 --> 00:17:05,982
IS NO LONGER WITH US,

412
00:17:05,982 --> 00:17:08,116
THAT GIRL IS THE ONLY ONE WHO

413
00:17:08,116 --> 00:17:10,682
CAN SEE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

414
00:17:10,682 --> 00:17:12,582
>> WHAT?

415
00:17:12,582 --> 00:17:15,049
>> SOON, VERY SOON.

416
00:17:15,049 --> 00:17:17,316
ONCE KAGOME'S EYES BECOME OURS,

417
00:17:17,316 --> 00:17:18,749
THE SACRED JEWEL WILL BECOME

418
00:17:18,749 --> 00:17:20,849
WHOLE ONCE AGAIN...

419
00:17:20,849 --> 00:17:22,249
THE SACRED JEWEL FILLED WITH

420
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,882
HATE, THAT IS.

421
00:17:23,882 --> 00:17:25,082
>> ARE YOU CRAZY?

422
00:17:25,082 --> 00:17:26,082
THERE IS NO WAY ON EARTH

423
00:17:26,082 --> 00:17:27,582
KAGOME WOULD DO ANYTHING TO

424
00:17:27,582 --> 00:17:29,082
HELP NARAKU!

425
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:30,049
>> HA.

426
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:31,282
THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO CORRUPT

427
00:17:31,282 --> 00:17:33,782
THAT GIRL, INUYASHA.

428
00:17:33,782 --> 00:17:35,982
SO LONG AS YOU CANNOT FORGET

429
00:17:35,982 --> 00:17:39,482
KIKYO.

430
00:17:39,482 --> 00:17:41,144
>> GRR...

431
00:17:47,182 --> 00:17:51,582
DAMN HIM.

432
00:17:51,582 --> 00:17:54,382
KAGOME, I'M SORRY I LEFT YOU

433
00:17:54,382 --> 00:17:57,416
ALL ALONE.

434
00:17:57,416 --> 00:17:58,749
I'LL NEVER LET YOU FALL INTO

435
00:17:58,749 --> 00:18:01,416
NARAKU'S HANDS AGAIN.

436
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:03,249
NEVER WILL I LET YOU SUFFER LIKE

437
00:18:03,249 --> 00:18:05,631
KIKYO DID.

438
00:18:18,349 --> 00:18:19,282
>> HMM.

439
00:18:19,282 --> 00:18:20,116
WHAT'S WRONG?

440
00:18:20,116 --> 00:18:21,349
YOU LOOK UNWELL.

441
00:18:21,349 --> 00:18:22,282
>> BE QUIET.

442
00:18:22,282 --> 00:18:23,916
I NEED TO SLEEP.

443
00:18:23,916 --> 00:18:26,416
KAGOME'S SOUL IS STRONGER

444
00:18:26,416 --> 00:18:28,316
THAN I EXPECTED.

445
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:32,249
I USED UP TOO MUCH ENERGY.

446
00:18:32,249 --> 00:18:34,449
>> WHAT'S WRONG WITH HIM?

447
00:18:34,449 --> 00:18:35,716
DID HIS STRUGGLE WITH KAGOME

448
00:18:35,716 --> 00:18:38,316
TIRE HIM OUT?

449
00:18:38,316 --> 00:18:39,982
HE MAY BE NARAKU'S OFFSPRING,

450
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:41,549
BUT APPARENTLY HE'S NOT

451
00:18:41,549 --> 00:18:43,549
ALL-POWERFUL.

452
00:20:38,185 --> 00:20:40,785
>> FORGIVE ME, KAEDE.

453
00:20:40,785 --> 00:20:43,385
>> SAY NO MORE, INUYASHA.

454
00:20:43,385 --> 00:20:45,352
MY SISTER, KIKYO,

455
00:20:45,352 --> 00:20:47,552
WAS FORCED TO RETURN TO THIS

456
00:20:47,552 --> 00:20:50,285
WORLD OF THE LIVING.

457
00:20:50,285 --> 00:20:53,852
WHILE HERE, HER SOUL ONLY

458
00:20:53,852 --> 00:20:55,885
SUFFERED.

459
00:20:55,885 --> 00:20:59,919
AND SO...

460
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,252
>> I WAS UNABLE TO SAVE

461
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:03,019
KIKYO'S SOUL.

462
00:21:03,019 --> 00:21:04,419
SHE WAS KILLED FOR A SECOND TIME

463
00:21:04,419 --> 00:21:07,352
BY THAT BASTARD NARAKU.

464
00:21:07,352 --> 00:21:09,052
>> SISTER KIKYO'S SOUL

465
00:21:09,052 --> 00:21:11,485
HAS FADED NOW.

466
00:21:11,485 --> 00:21:12,519
SHE WILL NO LONGER

467
00:21:12,519 --> 00:21:13,952
HAVE TO SUFFER.

468
00:21:13,952 --> 00:21:14,919
>> BUT I--

469
00:21:14,919 --> 00:21:16,919
>> SO, INUYASHA, YOU NEED NOT

470
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:21,285
SUFFER EITHER.

471
00:21:21,285 --> 00:21:23,819
YES, MY DEAR SISTER IS GONE, BUT

472
00:21:23,819 --> 00:21:27,719
I WISH HER REMAINS COULD BE

473
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:29,485
RETURNED TO HER PROPER

474
00:21:29,485 --> 00:21:30,886
RESTING PLACE.

475
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:38,652
>> I SURE HOPE KAGOME WILL BE

476
00:21:38,652 --> 00:21:40,185
ALL RIGHT.

477
00:21:40,185 --> 00:21:41,585
SHE'S BEEN SLEEPING EVER SINCE

478
00:21:41,585 --> 00:21:43,485
WE RETURNED TO THE VILLAGE.

479
00:21:43,485 --> 00:21:44,419
>> UH.

480
00:21:44,419 --> 00:21:46,019
INUYASHA IS WITH HER.

481
00:21:46,019 --> 00:21:47,352
>> SHE'LL BE JUST FINE.

482
00:21:47,352 --> 00:21:48,033
TRUST ME.

483
00:21:55,185 --> 00:21:59,052
>> HMM.

484
00:21:59,052 --> 00:22:05,052
>> KAGOME, ARE YOU AWAKE?

485
00:22:05,052 --> 00:22:05,719
>> HMM.

486
00:22:05,719 --> 00:22:07,219
I SEE YOU.

487
00:22:07,219 --> 00:22:08,619
SO YOU DID COME FOR ME

488
00:22:08,619 --> 00:22:11,552
AFTER ALL.

489
00:22:11,552 --> 00:22:13,685
>> ARE YOU OK?

490
00:22:13,685 --> 00:22:17,119
TAKE IT EASY.

491
00:22:17,119 --> 00:22:19,052
KAGOME, I'M SORRY ABOUT

492
00:22:19,052 --> 00:22:20,419
WHAT HAPPENED.

493
00:22:20,419 --> 00:22:22,785
I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU.

494
00:22:22,785 --> 00:22:24,485
>> IT'S OK, REALLY.

495
00:22:24,485 --> 00:22:25,785
>> IT IS NOT OK!

496
00:22:25,785 --> 00:22:26,652
I LET YOU GET INTO

497
00:22:26,652 --> 00:22:30,252
SERIOUS DANGER.

498
00:22:30,252 --> 00:22:31,752
ANY LATER, AND I WOULD HAVE LOST

499
00:22:31,752 --> 00:22:37,552
KAGOME, TOO.

500
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:40,185
>> BUT IF YOU WERE TO HEAR NEWS

501
00:22:40,185 --> 00:22:41,752
OF KIKYO'S WHEREABOUTS,

502
00:22:41,752 --> 00:22:42,852
YOU'D GO OFF TO LOOK FOR HER

503
00:22:42,852 --> 00:22:44,119
AGAIN, WOULDN'T YOU?

504
00:22:44,119 --> 00:22:45,152
>> NO, I WOULDN'T!

505
00:22:45,152 --> 00:22:46,285
I WILL NEVER LEAVE YOU AGAIN,

506
00:22:46,285 --> 00:22:47,219
KAGOME.

507
00:22:47,219 --> 00:22:48,385
>> YOU'RE A LIAR.

508
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,419
>> I AM NOT!

509
00:22:50,419 --> 00:22:51,185
>> JUST WHO DO YOU THINK

510
00:22:51,185 --> 00:22:52,285
YOU'RE KIDDING?

511
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:52,985
I'VE KNOWN YOU LONG ENOUGH TO

512
00:22:52,985 --> 00:22:54,852
LEARN A FEW THINGS ABOUT YOU,

513
00:22:54,852 --> 00:22:55,585
YOU KNOW.

514
00:22:55,585 --> 00:22:58,352
AND YOU WOULD DEFINITELY GO.

515
00:22:58,352 --> 00:22:59,952
>> GRR...

516
00:22:59,952 --> 00:23:01,219
>> AND IF YOU DO GO, THEN I'LL

517
00:23:01,219 --> 00:23:02,352
BE UPSET.

518
00:23:02,352 --> 00:23:04,119
BUT THAT'S TO BE EXPECTED,

519
00:23:04,119 --> 00:23:06,685
RIGHT?

520
00:23:06,685 --> 00:23:07,766
>> KAGOME.

521
00:23:13,019 --> 00:23:14,352
HEY, YOU'RE REALLY MAD,

522
00:23:14,352 --> 00:23:16,252
AREN'T YOU?

523
00:23:16,252 --> 00:23:17,913
>> YES, I SUPPOSE I AM.

524
00:23:23,385 --> 00:23:24,285
INUYASHA WILL NEVER

525
00:23:24,285 --> 00:23:27,252
FORGET KIKYO.

526
00:23:27,252 --> 00:23:29,019
BUT I STILL LOVE HIM, AND

527
00:23:29,019 --> 00:23:32,060
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN DO.

528
00:23:36,652 --> 00:23:38,785
>> THANK YOU, KAGOME.

529
00:23:46,626 --> 00:23:48,460
>> I CAME BACK TO THE PRESENT

530
00:23:48,460 --> 00:23:49,267
HOPING TO GET SOME SERIOUS

531
00:23:49,267 --> 00:23:51,308
STUDYING DONE.

532
00:23:51,308 --> 00:23:52,408
CHORUS.

533
00:23:52,408 --> 00:23:53,408
DRAMA.

534
00:23:53,408 --> 00:23:55,242
COOKING DEMONSTRATION!

535
00:23:55,242 --> 00:23:56,175
WHY NOT?

536
00:23:56,175 --> 00:23:57,475
IT'S A CULTURAL FESTIVAL.

537
00:23:57,475 --> 00:23:58,375
>> KAGOME, YOU DIDN'T HELP AT

538
00:23:58,375 --> 00:23:59,742
ALL WITH THE PREPARATIONS,

539
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:00,842
SO YOU'RE ON STANDBY FOR

540
00:24:00,842 --> 00:24:01,875
EVERYTHING.

541
00:24:01,875 --> 00:24:02,775
>> WE'RE COUNTING ON YOU,

542
00:24:02,775 --> 00:24:04,175
KAGOME.

543
00:24:04,175 --> 00:24:04,975
>> AND IF YOU MESS UP,

544
00:24:04,975 --> 00:24:06,675
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

545
00:24:06,675 --> 00:24:08,442
>> NEXT ON "INUYASHA..."

546
00:24:08,442 --> 00:24:09,408
"DON'T BOIL IT!

547
00:24:09,408 --> 00:24:10,942
THE TERRIFYING DRIED UP DEMON!"

548
00:24:10,942 --> 00:24:11,775
I'D RATHER FIGHT A DEMON IN

549
00:24:11,775 --> 00:24:12,608
THE FEUDAL ERA!
