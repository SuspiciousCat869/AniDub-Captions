00:21:41,290 --> 00:21:44,224
IN THAT CASE, HE MUST HAVE
ABANDONED IT,

325
00:21:44,257 --> 00:21:45,957
AND HE'S HIDING SOMEWHERE NEW.

326
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:52,190
STRANGE. UNTIL NOW, I'VE BEEN
ABLE TO SENSE HIS BARRIER.

327
00:21:53,757 --> 00:21:58,024
BUT THIS TIME, IT'S AS IF
HE'S VANISHED INTO THIN AIR,

328
00:21:58,057 --> 00:22:01,257
LEAVING NOT A TRACE BEHIND.

329
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:11,124
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS.

330
00:22:26,347 --> 00:22:29,081
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

331
00:24:01,436 --> 00:24:02,469
- DAMN THAT NARAKU!

332
00:24:02,503 --> 00:24:05,036
WE ALMOST HAD HIM CORNERED.

333
00:24:05,503 --> 00:24:06,569
- ARE YOU SURE THIS IS OK,

334
00:24:06,603 --> 00:24:08,703
THAT I'M BACK IN THE MODERN ERA?

335
00:24:08,736 --> 00:24:09,669
- HEY, KAGOME,

336
00:24:09,703 --> 00:24:12,603
IS IT MY IMAGINATION
OR HAVE WE CHANGED PLACES?

337
00:24:12,636 --> 00:24:13,469
- YOU'RE RIGHT!

338
00:24:13,503 --> 00:24:15,703
HOW ARE WE GONNA
GET THROUGH THE PREVIEW?

339
00:24:15,736 --> 00:24:16,903
- JUST RELAX AND DO IT.

340
00:24:16,936 --> 00:24:21,603
- NEXT TIME,
"GAP BETWEEN THE AGES."

341
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:24,136
HEY, I AIN'T TAKIN' NO TESTS.

342
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,169
- WHEW.
WE'RE BACK TO NORMAL.
