ABOUT HIM.

173
00:07:36,744 --> 00:07:38,244
ALL I SEE IS THE FACE OF A

174
00:07:38,244 --> 00:07:40,677
GOOD-HEARTED DOCTOR.

175
00:07:40,677 --> 00:07:42,410
SO WHY HAS SUCH A MAN GROUNDED

176
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:45,310
HIS SPIRIT IN THIS WORLD?

177
00:07:45,310 --> 00:07:47,377
>> [PANTING]

178
00:07:47,377 --> 00:07:48,344
>> OVER THAT WAY!

179
00:07:48,344 --> 00:07:49,477
I FEEL THE PRESENCE OF A SACRED

180
00:07:49,477 --> 00:07:51,310
JEWEL SHARD!

181
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,044
>> ALL RIGHT.

182
00:07:52,044 --> 00:07:54,244
WE'VE GOT YOU NOW, YOU BASTARD.

183
00:07:54,244 --> 00:07:55,410
>> FASTER, INUYASHA.

184
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,971
WHAT IS THIS BAND OF 7?

185
00:08:02,244 --> 00:08:03,677
AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT THERE ARE

186
00:08:03,677 --> 00:08:04,944
MORE OF THEM?

187
00:08:04,944 --> 00:08:06,444
>> YEAH. WHAT ABOUT IT?

188
00:08:06,444 --> 00:08:07,377
>> I SEE.

189
00:08:07,377 --> 00:08:09,777
VERY BRAVE OF YOU.

190
00:08:09,777 --> 00:08:13,010
CROW!

191
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,910
MASTER INUYASHA, I JUST

192
00:08:14,910 --> 00:08:15,844
REMEMBERED SOME IMPORTANT

193
00:08:15,844 --> 00:08:18,010
BUSINESS I REALLY MUST SEE TO.

194
00:08:18,010 --> 00:08:20,010
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

195
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:22,677
>> HEY! HOLD ON!

196
00:08:22,677 --> 00:08:24,877
>> GIVE THEM HELL!

197
00:08:24,877 --> 00:08:25,910
>> WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS DOES A

198
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:27,477
FLEA HAVE?

199
00:08:27,477 --> 00:08:29,077
>> NEVER MIND, INUYASHA.

200
00:08:29,077 --> 00:08:29,910
HE'S ALREADY DONE MORE THAN

201
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:30,844
ENOUGH.

202
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,177
IT'S BECAUSE OF MYOGA THAT THE 3

203
00:08:32,177 --> 00:08:34,744
OF US ARE ALIVE TODAY.

204
00:08:34,744 --> 00:08:35,544
>> HMM.

205
00:08:35,544 --> 00:08:36,444
YOU'RE RIGHT, KAGOME.

206
00:08:36,444 --> 00:08:38,777
>> JUST LET HIM GO.

207
00:08:38,777 --> 00:08:40,044
>> HMM.

208
00:08:40,044 --> 00:08:43,310
>> THANK YOU, MYOGA.

209
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,177
>> HMM.

210
00:08:44,177 --> 00:08:46,877
IS DR. SUIKOTSU AWAY?

211
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:47,577
>> YES.

212
00:08:47,577 --> 00:08:48,844
HE WENT TO PICK HERBS.

213
00:08:48,844 --> 00:08:50,377
>> OH, I SEE.

214
00:08:50,377 --> 00:08:51,610
>> IF YOU LIKE, I CAN HELP YOU

215
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:52,777
INSTEAD.

216
00:08:52,777 --> 00:08:53,810
>> REALLY?

217
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:57,644
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH.

218
00:08:57,644 --> 00:08:58,844
>> INUYASHA, THERE'S SOMETHING I

219
00:08:58,844 --> 00:09:00,210
DON'T GET.

220
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:00,910
>> WHAT?

221
00:09:00,910 --> 00:09:02,077
>> UNTIL NOW, THE JEWEL SHARDS

222
00:09:02,077 --> 00:09:03,610
POSSESSED BY THE BAND OF 7 HAVE

223
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:05,677
BEEN TAINTED, BUT THIS ONE'S

224
00:09:05,677 --> 00:09:09,577
VERY PURE.

225
00:09:09,577 --> 00:09:10,544
>> WHAT, SO THEN IT DOESN'T

226
00:09:10,544 --> 00:09:12,710
BELONG TO THE BAND OF 7?

227
00:09:12,710 --> 00:09:15,810
>> I'M NOT SURE.

228
00:09:15,810 --> 00:09:18,210
>> DR. SUIKOTSU, I FOUND SOME!

229
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:20,210
>> AH, GREEN GENTIAN.

230
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:22,710
GOOD FOR A WEAK STOMACH.

231
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:23,577
WE'LL PICK THESE, AND THEN WE'LL

232
00:09:23,577 --> 00:09:24,944
GO HOME, OK?

233
00:09:24,944 --> 00:09:26,210
>> UH-HUH.

234
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:27,451
HUH?

235
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:34,977
>> [WHIMPER]

236
00:09:34,977 --> 00:09:36,110
>> WELL, WELL, WELL,

237
00:09:36,110 --> 00:09:37,844
I FINALLY FOUND YOU.

238
00:09:37,844 --> 00:09:39,944
>> HUH?

239
00:09:39,944 --> 00:09:41,777
>> YES, OF COURSE I REMEMBER.

240
00:09:41,777 --> 00:09:43,010
DR. SUIKOTSU CAME TO THIS

241
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,510
VILLAGE OF OURS SHORTLY AFTER

242
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:48,210
THE TOMB OF THE 7 BROKE APART.

243
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:50,210
>> DID YOU SAY THE BAND OF 7?

244
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,277
>> YES.

245
00:09:51,277 --> 00:09:52,944
BY A STRANGE COINCIDENCE, DR.

246
00:09:52,944 --> 00:09:54,744
SUIKOTSU HAD THE SAME NAME AS

247
00:09:54,744 --> 00:09:56,777
ONE OF THOSE ACCURSED BEINGS.

248
00:09:56,777 --> 00:09:58,177
SO THERE WAS A PANIC AMONGST THE

249
00:09:58,177 --> 00:09:59,877
VILLAGERS, WHO BELIEVED HE WAS A

250
00:09:59,877 --> 00:10:01,877
SPECTER WHO HAD ESCAPED FROM A

251
00:10:01,877 --> 00:10:03,177
TOMB.

252
00:10:03,177 --> 00:10:04,844
>> DR. SUIKOTSU IS A MEMBER OF

253
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:07,444
THE BAND OF 7?

254
00:10:07,444 --> 00:10:08,710
>> OF COURSE NOT!

255
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,877
EVEN IF THE NAME IS THE SAME,

256
00:10:09,877 --> 00:10:10,744
THEY HAVE OPPOSITE

257
00:10:10,744 --> 00:10:12,810
PERSONALITIES.

258
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:14,010
I WITNESSED THE EXECUTION OF

259
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:16,344
THOSE 7 HEINOUS WARRIORS WITH MY

260
00:10:16,344 --> 00:10:17,910
VERY OWN EYES.

261
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:19,210
IT WAS A LONG TIME AGO, BUT I

262
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:22,144
REMEMBER IT CLEARLY.

263
00:10:22,144 --> 00:10:23,677
IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO, TO BE

264
00:10:23,677 --> 00:10:24,810
PRECISE.

265
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:25,910
7 MERCENARIES WHO CALLED

266
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:28,077
THEMSELVES THE BAND OF 7 ESCAPED

267
00:10:28,077 --> 00:10:30,477
HERE FROM THE EASTERN LANDS.

268
00:10:30,477 --> 00:10:31,410
THEY COMMITTED COUNTLESS

269
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:32,844
ATROCITIES, LEAVING DEATH AND

270
00:10:32,844 --> 00:10:35,010
SUFFERING IN THEIR WAKE, BUT

271
00:10:35,010 --> 00:10:36,377
THEN THEY FELL INTO A TRAP SET

272
00:10:36,377 --> 00:10:37,410
BY THE LORD OF THE REGION AND

273
00:10:37,410 --> 00:10:39,844
WERE EXECUTED BY THE LORD'S MEN.

274
00:10:39,844 --> 00:10:41,144
SUIKOTSU, ONE OF THE 7

275
00:10:41,144 --> 00:10:42,144
MERCENARIES, WAS A

276
00:10:42,144 --> 00:10:43,677
TERRIFYING-LOOKING CREATURE WHO

277
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:44,744
RESEMBLED MORE DEMON THAN

278
00:10:44,744 --> 00:10:48,477
HUMAN--TRULY EVIL BEING.

279
00:10:48,477 --> 00:10:49,877
BUT OUR SUIKOTSU IS TOTALLY

280
00:10:49,877 --> 00:10:51,144
DIFFERENT.

281
00:10:51,144 --> 00:10:54,044
WHY, THE MAN IS ALMOST A SAINT.

282
00:10:54,044 --> 00:10:54,977
>> THERE YOU GO.

283
00:10:54,977 --> 00:10:56,077
>> HUH?

284
00:10:56,077 --> 00:10:56,910
OH.

285
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,544
THAT FEELS SO MUCH BETTER NOW.

286
00:10:58,544 --> 00:11:00,544
THE PAIN'S ALL GONE AWAY.

287
00:11:00,544 --> 00:11:01,544
>> THERE ARE PLENTY OF MEDICINAL

288
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:02,944
HERBS GROWING IN THIS REGION

289
00:11:02,944 --> 00:11:04,610
THAT I WAS ABLE TO USE.

290
00:11:04,610 --> 00:11:05,510
>> THANK YOU VERY MUCH, YOUNG

291
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:07,144
LADY.

292
00:11:07,144 --> 00:11:08,144
PLEASE GIVE MY REGARDS TO

293
00:11:08,144 --> 00:11:09,777
DR. SUIKOTSU.

294
00:11:09,777 --> 00:11:12,544
IS THERE SOMETHING THE MATTER?

295
00:11:12,544 --> 00:11:14,044
>> I SENSE A JEWEL SHARD.

296
00:11:14,044 --> 00:11:14,944
>> HUH?

297
00:11:14,944 --> 00:11:16,444
IT'S APPROACHING.

298
00:11:16,444 --> 00:11:20,310
TWO OF THEM--NO, 3.

299
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:21,110
>> WHO ARE YOU?

300
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:22,377
WHAT DO YOU WANT WITH ME?

301
00:11:22,377 --> 00:11:23,277
>> DROP THE ACT.

302
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:24,410
I KNOW YOU'RE ONE OF THE BAND OF

303

7.

304
00:11:26,144 --> 00:11:26,844
>> HOLD ON.

305
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:28,477
THERE MUST BE SOME MISTAKE.

306
00:11:28,477 --> 00:11:29,744
I'M A PHYSICIAN.

307
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:32,444
I'M NOT A WARRIOR OF ANY KIND.

308

>> DON'T TRY TO DENY IT.

309
