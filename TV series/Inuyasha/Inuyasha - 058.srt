- YOU.

00:02:17,168 --> 00:02:18,701

YOU'RE A HALF DEMON.

KEEP STRUGGLING.

00:02:46,968 --> 00:02:51,801
THAT'S THE BOTTLE KAGOME USED TO
KEEP THE JEWEL SHARDS IN.

22
00:02:55,768 --> 00:03:00,701
TELL ME WHAT YOU'VE
DONE WITH THE OWNER OF
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS!

23
00:03:00,735 --> 00:03:01,935
- OWNER?

24
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:04,135
I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY OWNER.

00:03:04,168 --> 00:03:05,301
I FOUND THESE.

26
00:03:05,335 --> 00:03:09,001
- DON'T PLAY INNOCENT WITH ME.
YOU STOLE THOSE FROM KAGOME.

27
00:03:09,035 --> 00:03:09,801
- KAGOME?

28
00:03:09,835 --> 00:03:12,701
- THE GIRL WHO HAD
THE JEWEL SHARDS!

29
00:03:12,735 --> 00:03:14,901

30

WHAT TREMENDOUS NEWS!

HA HA HA!

34
00:03:31,568 --> 00:03:32,768
- KAGOME, I'LL FIND YOU.

35
00:03:32,801 --> 00:03:35,768
JUST KEEP HIDING
TILL I GET TO YOU.

36
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,635
- LET'S SEE.

37
00:03:36,668 --> 00:03:40,135
I FOUND THE SHARDS
SOMEWHERE AROUND HERE.

38
00:03:40,168 --> 00:03:40,935
HUH?

39
00:03:40,968 --> 00:03:44,101
SHE MUST BE
IN MY MINIATURE VILLAGE.

40

41

KAGOME, EVERYTHING'S
SET OVER HERE.

42

51
00:04:23,901 --> 00:04:26,135

TO PLEASE NIMENKA.

AN UNUSUAL HALF DEMON
AND A YOUNG GIRL,
ALL WITHIN HOURS.

00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,135
ANSWER ME!

69

INUYASHA'S NOT HURT, IS HE?

70
00:05:21,235 --> 00:05:23,468
YOU'LL BE SORRY IF HE IS.

71
00:05:23,501 --> 00:05:27,901
- LISTEN TO KAGOME CHEW HIM OUT,
NOT A SIGN OF FEAR.

72
00:05:27,935 --> 00:05:30,868
- THAT COMES FROM EXPERIENCE,
I SUPPOSE.

73
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:33,768

00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,668
UH!

75
00:05:35,701 --> 00:05:38,068

- I CAN'T STAND IT!

80
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:55,168
HUMAN BODIES ARE SO WEAK
AND VULNERABLE.

81
00:05:55,201 --> 00:06:01,035
I'VE LOST TOO MUCH BLOOD.
I'M STARTING TO GET DIZZY.

82
00:06:01,068 --> 00:06:04,601
- STILL ALIVE, ARE YOU,
HALF DEMON?

83
00:06:09,468 --> 00:06:11,035

WHERE'S KAGOME?
TELL ME WHERE THE GIRL IS!

86
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:20,401

HAS BECOME VERY BOTHERSOME
SINCE YOU BROKE MY GOURD.

87
00:06:20,435 --> 00:06:23,035
- EXTRACTING NOURISHMENT?

88

89
00:06:24,468 --> 00:06:27,268

90
00:06:27,301 --> 00:06:30,468

YOUR EXPRESSION SAYS IT ALL.

91
00:06:30,501 --> 00:06:32,501
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH THAT FILTHY GIRL.

92
00:06:32,535 --> 00:06:35,668
YOU'LL SEE HER SOON ENOUGH...
INSIDE MY BELLY, THAT IS.

93
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:41,801
YOU WILL BOTH BECOME THE FRUIT

00:06:44,135 --> 00:06:46,901
YAAAH! UH!

97
00:06:46,935 --> 00:06:48,101

98
00:06:48,135 --> 00:06:52,701
YOU CANNOT ESCAPE
FROM THOSE THORNY ROOTS.

- INUYASHA!

100
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,368
- BECAUSE I'M THIS SMALL,
I DON'T KNOW HOW EFFECTIVE

101
00:06:55,401 --> 00:06:59,201
MY WIND TUNNEL WILL BE,
BUT HERE GOES!

00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:08,868

- KAGOME.

104
00:07:20,235 --> 00:07:22,568
- WAIT, INUYASHA.

105
00:07:22,601 --> 00:07:25,901
- KAGOME IS DOWN
IN THE BASEMENT.

106
00:07:25,935 --> 00:07:27,801

HUH? WHERE AM I?
WHAT IS GOING ON?

- SHE'S ALIVE.

115
00:08:04,701 --> 00:08:07,868
- INUYASHA, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

116
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,435
- THESE ARE JUST SCRATCHES.

117

COVER UP.

118
00:08:13,501 --> 00:08:17,168
IT'S TORN, BUT IT'S
BETTER THAN NOTHING.

119
00:08:17,201 --> 00:08:19,835

INUYASHA?

123

YOU'VE BEEN FIGHTING SO HARD,
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE A HUMAN NOW.

124
00:08:31,635 --> 00:08:34,468

128
00:08:51,268 --> 00:08:54,335
- LOOKS LIKE INUYASHA'S
IN PRETTY BAD SHAPE.

129
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:55,101
- YOU'RE RIGHT.

130
00:08:55,135 --> 00:08:56,401
HIS INJURIES LOOK
PRETTY SERIOUS.

131
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,968
WE REALLY SHOULDN'T TRY
TO MOVE HIM.

132
00:09:00,001 --> 00:09:01,435
- I THINK WE CAN GET OUT.

00:09:01,468 --> 00:09:03,901
CAN YOU WALK, INUYASHA?

134

- OUTSIDE? IS IT MORNING YET?

135
00:09:07,201 --> 00:09:08,335
- IT'S PITCH DARK.

136
00:09:08,368 --> 00:09:10,268
YOU'RE PLANNING TO STAY
AND FIGHT?

137
00:09:10,301 --> 00:09:11,535
- YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT.

EVERYONE UNTIL DAYBREAK.

140
00:09:33,368 --> 00:09:35,868
- I GUESS WE CAN'T
JUMP FROM HERE.

141
00:09:35,901 --> 00:09:37,935
WELL, WE CAN'T, CAN WE?

142
00:09:37,968 --> 00:09:42,968
PLUS WE HAVE TO GET MOROKU
AND SHIPPO BACK TO THEIR
NORMAL SIZES.

143

- I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU YET!

- YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME
TO ESCAPE ALONE, RIGHT? NO!

146
00:09:50,468 --> 00:09:53,268
- IS SOMEONE THERE?
- [GASP]

147
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,301
- DID YOU ESCAPE
FROM THE BOX GARDEN?

148
00:09:58,335 --> 00:09:59,801
- WHO ARE YOU, OLD MAN?

149
00:09:59,835 --> 00:10:04,401
- I'M ASHAMED TO ADMIT IT,
BUT I WAS TOKAJIN'S MENTOR.

150
00:10:04,435 --> 00:10:06,935
- SO THEN YOU'RE A SAGE AS WELL?

151
00:10:06,968 --> 00:10:07,868
- WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?

152
00:10:07,901 --> 00:10:11,120
HOW COULD YOU LET THAT ANIMAL
BECOME A SAGE?

- INUYASHA!

154
00:10:12,086 --> 00:10:16,153
- OH, IT WAS NOT I
THAT MADE TOKAJIN A SAGE.

155
00:10:16,186 --> 00:10:17,886
IT WAS NIMENKA.

156
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:20,153
- THE DEMON TREE.

157
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,986
- YES. IT HAPPENED
ABOUT A MONTH AGO.

158
00:10:27,786 --> 00:10:30,686
- I CAN'T STAND THIS TRAINING
DAY IN AND DAY OUT.

159
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:36,020
THERE HAS GOT TO BE A FASTER WAY
THAN THIS TO BECOME A SAGE.

160
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:40,553
HMM? WHAT'S THIS?

161
00:10:40,586 --> 00:10:44,153
HUH. WHO CARES?
CAN'T EAT IT.

- AH, A SACRED JEWEL SHARD.
THANK YOU.

163
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:52,220
- WHO SAID THAT?

164
00:10:52,253 --> 00:10:54,820
- I AM NIMENKA.

165
00:10:54,853 --> 00:11:00,620
YOU THERE. DO YOU WISH
FOR A SAGE'S POWER?

166
00:11:00,653 --> 00:11:02,220
- UH-HUH.

167
00:11:02,253 --> 00:11:06,153
- THEN EAT MY HUMAN-FACED FRUIT.

168
00:11:07,686 --> 00:11:13,053
EAT, AND YOU SHALL POSSESS
THE ART OF THE SAGES.

169
00:11:16,586 --> 00:11:17,886
- EXCELLENT.

170
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:22,853
SWALLOW THE SEEDS, TOO,
AND YOU SHALL HAVE POWER,
A SAGE'S POWER!

171
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:30,420
- WHEN ONE EATS THE HUMAN-FACED
FRUIT FROM THE DEMON TREE,
ONE BECOMES A SLAVE TO NIMENKA.

172
00:11:30,453 --> 00:11:35,320
TOKAJIN OBEYED THE TREE'S
COMMAND TO TURN ME
INTO FERTILIZER

173
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:38,453
SO THAT IT WOULD BEAR
THE FRUIT OF LONGEVITY.

174
00:11:38,486 --> 00:11:41,920
- MASTER SAGE, WHO TRANSFORMED
YOU INTO A PLANT?

175
00:11:41,953 --> 00:11:46,353
- THE FRUIT ALONE ISN'T
ENOUGH FOR LONGEVITY.

176
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:50,186
YOU SEE, THE FRUIT HAS TO BE
SOAKED AND MADE INTO A POTION,

177
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,620
AND ONLY I HAVE KNOWLEDGE
OF THE PROCESS.

178
00:11:53,653 --> 00:11:56,120

HA HA HA! WE MEET AGAIN.
SO THIS IS WHERE YOU ESCAPED TO.

181
00:12:04,053 --> 00:12:07,020
- THE POWER OF THE SHARDS
IS INCREASING!

182
00:12:07,053 --> 00:12:12,920
- TOKAJIN IS NO LONGER HUMAN.
YOU MUST SLAY HIM.

183
00:12:12,953 --> 00:12:15,153
- THAT'S RIGHT.
I'M NO LONGER HUMAN.

184
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:21,520
HUMANS SPEND THEIR MISERABLE
DAYS SLAVING IN THE MUD,
THEN GROW OLD AND DIE.

185
00:12:21,553 --> 00:12:24,186
MY PARENTS BOTH LIVED
AND DIED LIKE THAT.

186
00:12:24,220 --> 00:12:27,553
I REFUSE TO LIVE SUCH
A WEAK, SENSELESS LIFE.

187
00:12:27,586 --> 00:12:30,853
- I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU!
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN THEY WERE!

188
00:12:30,886 --> 00:12:34,286
YOU SACRIFICED OTHERS
JUST SO YOU COULD HAVE
LONGEVITY!

189
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,086
THAT'S NOT STRONG. THAT'S EVIL!

190
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:39,086
- I AM MORE POWERFUL THAN ANYONE
YOU'VE EVER KNOWN,

191
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,553
AND THAT'S WHY I CAN TAKE
ADVANTAGE OF THE WEAK.

CAN'T YOU UNDERSTAND EVEN THAT?

THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS,

196
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:57,786
I HAVE BECOME INVINCIBLE.

197
00:12:57,820 --> 00:13:04,853
I SHALL HAVE ETERNAL LIFE
AND TURN MERE WEAKLINGS
LIKE YOU INTO FERTILIZER!

198

YOU DISGUSTING EXCUSE
FOR A HUMAN!

LET ME DEMONSTRATE!

00:20:38,744 --> 00:20:41,878
- AAH! INUYASHA IS GONE FOREVER!

317
00:20:41,911 --> 00:20:44,544
- DON'T SAY THAT.
INUYASHA IS STILL ALIVE.

318
00:20:44,578 --> 00:20:47,178
- OH, BUT HE WAS SO BADLY HURT,

319
00:20:47,211 --> 00:20:52,178
AND NO MORTAL COULD SURVIVE
A FALL FROM A CLIFF LIKE THIS!

320
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:56,344
- DON'T CRY, SHIPPO.
LET US PRAY FOR HIS REPOSE.

321
00:20:56,378 --> 00:20:57,544
- OH, MOROKU.

322
00:20:57,578 --> 00:21:01,111
- INUYASHA LEFT BEHIND
NO REGRETS WHEN HE PASSED ON.

323
00:21:01,144 --> 00:21:04,711
HE WANTED TO SAVE YOU,
EVEN IF IT COST HIM HIS LIFE.

324
00:21:04,744 --> 00:21:07,311
- HE DID THAT TO SAVE ME?

325
00:21:08,478 --> 00:21:10,811
HOW CAN I EVER LIVE
WITH THAT ON MY SHOULDERS?

326
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:15,344
HOW COULD HE BE SO STUPID,
DOING THAT WHILE HE HAD
NO DEMON POWER?

327
00:21:15,378 --> 00:21:17,611
INUYASHA, YOU'RE SUCH AN IDIOT!

328
00:21:17,644 --> 00:21:21,411
STUPID, STUPID!
HOW COULD YOU DIE ON ME?!

329
00:21:21,444 --> 00:21:24,878
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO NOW?

330
00:21:24,911 --> 00:21:27,011
- YES, HE WAS INDEED FOOLISH.

331
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:27,811
- YOU SAID IT!

332
00:21:27,844 --> 00:21:30,044
INUYASHA WAS THE BIGGEST
FOOL OF ALL!

333
00:21:30,078 --> 00:21:32,944
- HEY! I'M GONE
FOR ONLY 5 MINUTES,

334
00:21:32,978 --> 00:21:35,411
AND LOOK WHAT HAPPENS
TO ALL OF YOU.

335
00:21:35,444 --> 00:21:37,378
SO, WHO WERE YOU CALLING
AN IDIOT?

336
00:21:37,411 --> 00:21:40,611
- YOU'RE ALIVE, INUYASHA!
YOU'RE ALIVE!

337
00:21:40,644 --> 00:21:43,944
- I KNEW YOU'D SURVIVE
THAT SEEMINGLY FATAL FALL.

338
00:21:43,978 --> 00:21:46,211
NO, REALLY, I DID.

339
00:21:47,478 --> 00:21:49,111
- THANK GOODNESS.

340
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:50,878
- I AIN'T SO EASY TO KNOCK OFF.

341
00:21:50,911 --> 00:21:54,478
HOW COULD YOU EVEN THINK
ANYTHING SO INCREDIBLY STUPID?

342
00:21:54,511 --> 00:21:59,311
- YOU CAN HARDLY BLAME US.
WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT YOU, OK?

343
00:21:59,344 --> 00:22:00,444
- HUH?

344
00:22:00,478 --> 00:22:02,578
- WE KNEW YOU WERE
OVEREXERTING YOURSELF.

345
00:22:02,611 --> 00:22:06,278
- STOP BLUBBERING! I'M ALIVE,
SO WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

346
00:22:06,311 --> 00:22:07,878
- I'M NOT BLUBBERING!

347
00:22:07,911 --> 00:22:09,311
- OK, THEN, CRYING.

348
00:22:09,344 --> 00:22:12,011
- I AM NOT!
- ARE SO!

349
00:22:12,044 --> 00:22:12,944
- AM NOT!

350
00:22:12,978 --> 00:22:13,811
- ARE!
- NOT!

351
00:22:13,844 --> 00:22:17,444
- ARE SO!
- SHUT UP AND SIT!

352
00:22:17,478 --> 00:22:19,244
- NOW HE'S DEAD!

353
00:22:31,251 --> 00:22:33,951
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

354
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:01,151
- OH, SANGO, YOU'VE BEEN
GONE JUST 3 DAYS,

355
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,584
AND YET IT SEEMS
LIKE A LIFETIME.

356
00:24:03,617 --> 00:24:06,017
TWO WOULD-BE APPRENTICES
SHOWED UP AT YOUR VILLAGE,

357
00:24:06,051 --> 00:24:08,884
WANTING YOU TO TEACH THEM
TO BECOME DEMON SLAYERS,

358
00:24:08,917 --> 00:24:11,151
AND THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL SISTERS?

359
00:24:11,184 --> 00:24:14,017
OH, POOR YOU, SANGO.
TOUGH BREAK.

360
00:24:14,051 --> 00:24:15,617
MAYBE I SHOULD GO LEND A HAND.

361
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:19,351
NEXT TIME, "THE BEAUTIFUL
SISTER APPRENTICES."

362
00:24:19,384 --> 00:24:21,851
ARE YOU OK, SANGO?

363
00:24:21,884 --> 00:24:22,884
COME ON.

364
00:24:22,917 --> 00:24:23,284
IT'S NOT AS IF I HAVEN'T TOUCHED
YOU THERE BEFORE.
