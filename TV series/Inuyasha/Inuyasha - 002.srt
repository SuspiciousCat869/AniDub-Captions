I WAS PULLED INTO
A HIDDEN WELL

ON MY FAMILY'S SHRINE.

3
00:01:31,955 --> 00:01:34,355
I'M JUST A GIRL
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, OK?

00:01:34,389 --> 00:01:37,689
NOTHING THAT WEIRD
HAS EVER HAPPENED TO ME.

00:01:37,722 --> 00:01:39,355
THERE WAS A BOY, INUYASHA,

PINNED TO A TREE
WHEN I CAME OUT.

HELD FOREVER,

BUT SOMEHOW I BROKE IT.

NOW MONSTERS ARE AFTER
THE SACRED JEWEL OF 4 SOULS,

INSIDE MY BODY?

13
00:02:16,489 --> 00:02:20,822
WHY WOULD I HAVE A JEWEL
WANTED BY DEMONS?

14
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:23,522
- IF YOU HAND
THE JEWEL OVER RIGHT NOW,
