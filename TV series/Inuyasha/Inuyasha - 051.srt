PASSED DOWN
FROM SESSHOMARU'S FATHER,

67
00:05:44,555 --> 00:05:48,988
WERE CARVED FROM
MY VERY OWN BOUGHS.

68

- THEY WERE?

69
00:05:50,088 --> 00:05:54,322
SO THE SHEATHS FOR THEIR SWORDS
CAME FROM THIS TREE.

70
00:05:54,355 --> 00:05:56,622
THEY HOLD SUCH STRANGE POWERS.

71
00:05:56,655 --> 00:05:59,888
OH, I CAN SEE WHY, AFTER SEEING

BETWEEN INUYASHA

- INUYASHA--YOUR YOUNGER
BROTHER?

75
00:06:12,688 --> 00:06:14,488
- INUYASHA'S BLOOD HAS CHANGED.

76
00:06:14,522 --> 00:06:18,655
THE FIRST TIME WAS WHEN A DEMON
BIT AND BROKE THE TETSUSAIGA.

77
00:06:18,688 --> 00:06:24,655
THE SECOND TIME, HE HAD LET GO
OF TETSUSAIGA WHILE FIGHTING ME.

78
00:06:35,988 --> 00:06:37,555
DIE!

79

THAT SCENT AGAIN.

80
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,488
HIS SCENT WASN'T
THAT OF A HALF-DEMON'S.

81
00:06:52,522 --> 00:06:54,955
IT WAS THE SMELL
OF A PURE DEMON'S BLOOD,

82
00:06:54,988 --> 00:06:57,255
LIKE MINE AND MY FATHER'S.

83
00:06:57,288 --> 00:07:00,455

00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:03,488
I HAVE MY DOUBTS.

86
00:07:03,522 --> 00:07:05,588
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

87
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:11,622
- INUYASHA IS A HALF-DEMON, BORN
BETWEEN A DEMON AND A HUMAN.

88
00:07:11,655 --> 00:07:15,655
HE COULD NEVER BECOME
A FULL-FLEDGED DEMON.

89
00:07:15,688 --> 00:07:21,022
SESSHOMARU, THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT YOU, A PURE-BLOODED DEMON,

90
00:07:21,055 --> 00:07:22,988
ARE CAPABLE OF ACCOMPLISHING,

91
00:07:23,022 --> 00:07:26,488
BUT WHICH INUYASHA
COULD NEVER DO.

92
00:07:26,522 --> 00:07:29,588
- GO ON.

93
00:07:29,622 --> 00:07:30,888
- IT IS SIMPLE.

94
00:07:30,922 --> 00:07:33,455
I SPEAK OF PROTECTING ONESELF.

95
00:07:33,488 --> 00:07:35,322
- PROTECTING ONESELF?

96
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:36,722
- YES.

97
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:40,388
IN BATTLE, FOR INSTANCE.

98
00:07:40,422 --> 00:07:43,755
IF YOU FIND YOURSELF
IN A HOPELESS SITUATION,

99
00:07:43,788 --> 00:07:45,888
YOU ARE ABLE TO REMAIN CALM.

100
00:07:45,922 --> 00:07:50,288
YOU NEVER LOSE CONTROL OF
YOURSELF.

101
00:07:50,322 --> 00:07:51,222
- HUH.

102
00:07:51,255 --> 00:07:53,122
IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE
FOR ME TO FALL INTO

103
00:07:53,155 --> 00:07:55,188
SUCH A DESPERATE SITUATION.

104
00:07:55,222 --> 00:07:56,155
- HA HA!

105
00:07:56,188 --> 00:07:58,222
NO, I DON'T SUPPOSE YOU WOULD.

106
00:07:58,255 --> 00:08:01,122
INUYASHA IS ANOTHER MATTER,
HOWEVER.

107
00:08:01,155 --> 00:08:05,155
IF BACKED INTO A CORNER
TO THE POINT WHERE
HIS LIFE IS IN DANGER,

108
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:08,422
HIS DEMON BLOOD TAKES
CONTROL OF THE BODY,

109
00:08:08,455 --> 00:08:12,355
AND IT TRANSFORMS
IN ORDER TO PRESERVE HIS LIFE.

110
00:08:12,388 --> 00:08:16,088
- THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
HIS TRANSFORMATION.

111
00:08:17,222 --> 00:08:19,188
- UNFORTUNATELY FOR INUYASHA,

112
00:08:19,222 --> 00:08:22,155
THE PURE DEMON BLOOD OF
HIS FATHER IS TOO STRONG

113
00:08:22,188 --> 00:08:26,055
FOR A HALF-DEMON
SUCH AS HIMSELF.

114
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:27,322
- WHAT WILL THE OUTCOME BE?

115
00:08:27,355 --> 00:08:35,355
- WELL, IN ESSENCE,
THE DEMON BLOOD WILL
DEVOUR HIS HUMAN SOUL.

116
00:08:35,388 --> 00:08:36,255
- ARRGH!

117
00:08:36,288 --> 00:08:38,688
- HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO
RECOGNIZE HIMSELF.

118
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:42,922
HE WILL NOT BE ABLE
TO DIFFERENTIATE
BETWEEN FRIEND OR FOE.

119
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:45,222
HE WILL SIMPLY KILL.

120
00:08:45,255 --> 00:08:47,488
AND WITH REPEATED
TRANSFORMATIONS,

121
00:08:47,522 --> 00:08:51,255
INUYASHA WILL EVENTUALLY
LOSE HIS SOUL.

122
00:08:51,288 --> 00:08:56,155
HE WILL BECOME A DEMON WHO ONLY
KNOWS HOW TO FIGHT AND KILL,

123
00:08:56,188 --> 00:09:01,288
AND HE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT
UNTIL HE IS DESTROYED.

124
00:09:01,322 --> 00:09:04,055
- [SNARLING]

125
00:09:04,722 --> 00:09:07,588
- I SINCERELY DOUBT THAT
YOUR FATHER WOULD HAVE WISHED

126
00:09:07,622 --> 00:09:10,888
SUCH A TERRIBLE FATE
UPON HIS OWN SON.

127
00:09:10,922 --> 00:09:16,055
THAT IS WHY HE BEQUEATHED
INUYASHA THE SWORD TETSUSAIGA

128
00:09:16,088 --> 00:09:18,188
TO PROTECT HIS SOUL.

129
00:09:18,222 --> 00:09:19,855
- THE TETSUSAIGA PROTECTS HIM?

130
00:09:19,888 --> 00:09:26,288
SO...IF HE RELEASES THE SWORD,
HE IS DOOMED.

131
00:09:29,422 --> 00:09:32,888
- INUYASHA, YOU'VE SURE DONE
A LOT OF GROWING UP.

132
00:09:32,922 --> 00:09:35,422
- HUH? WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

133
00:09:35,455 --> 00:09:36,788
- IT'S A COMPLIMENT.

134
00:09:36,822 --> 00:09:40,955
I MEAN, YOU SAVED KOHAKU'S LIFE
INSTEAD OF KILLING HIM.

135
00:09:40,988 --> 00:09:42,022
- HUH!

136
00:09:42,055 --> 00:09:44,588
YEAH, WELL, I ONLY DID IT TO GET
UNDER NARAKU'S SKIN.

137
00:09:44,622 --> 00:09:47,755
IF WE CAN MANAGE TO GET
KOHAKU BACK ALIVE,

138
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:49,888
THAT OUGHT TO
REALLY TICK HIM OFF.

139
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,922
- PUTTING ON AN ACT AGAIN.

140
00:09:51,955 --> 00:09:54,955
- AND BESIDES, YOU'RE ALIVE.

141
00:09:54,988 --> 00:09:57,555
KOHAKU SPARED YOU.

142
00:09:57,588 --> 00:09:59,255
- HUH?

143
00:09:59,288 --> 00:10:02,422
YOU WERE WORRIED?
- DO YOU NEED TO ASK?

144
00:10:02,455 --> 00:10:05,955
- YOU KNOW, I WAS KIND OF
WORRIED MYSELF.

145
00:10:05,988 --> 00:10:09,122
IT TOOK YOU SO LONG
TO COME BACK FOR ME.

146
00:10:09,155 --> 00:10:11,255
- HMM.
IS YOUR ARM HURTING YOU?

147
00:10:11,288 --> 00:10:13,655
LET ME TAKE A LOOK AT IT.

148
00:10:13,688 --> 00:10:15,955
- NEVER MIND.
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF.

149
00:10:15,988 --> 00:10:17,622
- HEY, IT WILL GET A LOT WORSE

150
00:10:17,655 --> 00:10:19,522
UNLESS YOU TAKE CARE OF IT
EARLY ON.

151
00:10:19,555 --> 00:10:22,222
- IT'S OK.
- IT ISN'T OK!

152
00:10:22,255 --> 00:10:24,088
- I SAID I'M ALL RIGHT!
- ARE NOT!

153
00:10:24,122 --> 00:10:26,755
- AM, TOO!
[BOTH GRUNTING]

154
00:10:26,788 --> 00:10:29,422
- SORRY. I JUST WANTED
TO THANK YOU BOTH.

155
00:10:29,455 --> 00:10:31,955
- HUH?
- THANK US FOR WHAT?

156
00:10:31,988 --> 00:10:35,522
- FOR THE OBVIOUS,
KAGOME AND INUYASHA--

157
00:10:35,555 --> 00:10:37,855
FOR STAYING WITH ME.

158
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,688
- CARRY ON, YOU GUYS.
