515
00:15:10,986 --> 00:15:11,686
LIKE ANOTHER WEAPON.

516
00:15:11,686 --> 00:15:13,019
>> WHAT ARE YOU FOOLS IMAGINING,

517
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,619
ANYWAY?

518
00:15:14,619 --> 00:15:16,019
>> IF INUYASHA STAYS STUCK TO

519
00:15:16,019 --> 00:15:17,486
THE BOULDER...

520
00:15:17,486 --> 00:15:18,653
SEE YOU LATER, GUYS.

521
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,586
I'M GOING BACK HOME NOW.

522
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,686
>> HEY, WAIT, KAGOME!

523
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,153
>> NO CAN DO.

524
00:15:24,153 --> 00:15:26,053
>> DON'T JUST LEAVE ON ME!

525
00:15:26,053 --> 00:15:28,186
[GRUNTING]

526
00:15:28,186 --> 00:15:29,253
DAMN.

527
00:15:29,253 --> 00:15:30,753
[GRUNTING]

528
00:15:30,753 --> 00:15:32,653

529
00:15:32,653 --> 00:15:34,919
>> OH, GREAT. NOT YOU, TOO.

530
00:15:34,919 --> 00:15:36,519
WHAT ARE YOU PICTURING?

531
00:15:36,519 --> 00:15:37,719
>> I KNOW, INUYASHA.

532
00:15:37,719 --> 00:15:39,319
WHY DON'T I TRY SUCKING UP THE

533
00:15:39,319 --> 00:15:40,619
BOULDER THROUGH MY WIND TUNNEL?

534
00:15:40,619 --> 00:15:42,086
THAT'S A GOOD IDEA.

535
00:15:42,086 --> 00:15:42,886
>> CAN YOU SUCK UP THE BOULDER

536
00:15:42,886 --> 00:15:43,886
AND NOT ME?

537
00:15:43,886 --> 00:15:44,753
>> IF I STOP IN THE NICK

538
00:15:44,753 --> 00:15:47,353
OF TIME, IT JUST MIGHT WORK.

539
00:15:47,353 --> 00:15:48,686
HERE'S THE PLAN.

540
00:15:48,686 --> 00:15:49,686
I'LL OPEN MY WIND TUNNEL

541
00:15:49,686 --> 00:15:51,119
LIKE THIS, SUCK UP THE ROCK,

542
00:15:51,119 --> 00:15:52,319
AND JUST AS YOU GET NEAR IT,

543
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,653
I'LL CLOSE MY--UGH.

544
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:55,919
>> [TOGETHER] HUH?

545
00:15:55,919 --> 00:15:56,753
>> WHAT NOW?

546
00:15:56,753 --> 00:15:58,653
WHAT DID YOU STOP TALKING FOR?

547
00:15:58,653 --> 00:16:00,319
>> WELL, IT'S JUST IF YOU'RE

548
00:16:00,319 --> 00:16:01,553
HALF SUCKED IN...

549
00:16:01,553 --> 00:16:03,619
WELL, NO, NOTHING. NEVER MIND.

550
00:16:03,619 --> 00:16:06,019
>> NOW WHAT ARE YOU IMAGINING?

551
00:16:06,019 --> 00:16:07,586
>> NOTHING. JUST FORGET IT.

552
00:16:07,586 --> 00:16:08,953
LET'S GIVE IT A TRY.

553
00:16:08,953 --> 00:16:10,119
DON'T WORRY.

554
00:16:10,119 --> 00:16:12,186
I PROBABLY WON'T SUCK YOU IN.

555
00:16:12,186 --> 00:16:15,504
>> UH-UH! STOP!

556
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,219
>> AHCHOO!

557
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,719
AH.

558
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:25,953
>> WHY DON'T YOU GO ON INSIDE

559
00:16:25,953 --> 00:16:26,953
WITH THE OTHERS?

560
00:16:26,953 --> 00:16:28,253
YOU DON'T HAVE TO STAY OUT HERE

561
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:30,419
IN THE COLD WITH ME.

562
00:16:30,419 --> 00:16:31,486
>> WOULDN'T YOU BE LONELY

563
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:32,419
SITTING OUT HERE

564
00:16:32,419 --> 00:16:33,519
ALL BY YOURSELF?

565
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,686
>> HUH! NOT HARDLY, STUPID.

566
00:16:35,686 --> 00:16:37,286
>> I'LL GO, THEN, IF YOU WANT.

567
00:16:37,286 --> 00:16:39,686
>> I NEVER SAID I WANTED YOU TO.

568
00:16:39,686 --> 00:16:40,353
>> YOU SURE?

569
00:16:40,353 --> 00:16:42,619
>> MM-HMM.

570
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:43,419
>> [THINKING] HOW ARE WE GONNA

571
00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:45,086
GET THAT THING OFF HIM?

572
00:16:45,086 --> 00:16:47,484
THERE MUST BE ANOTHER WAY.

573
00:16:51,986 --> 00:16:53,353
EXCUSE ME.

574
00:16:53,353 --> 00:16:54,486
>> HMM?

575
00:16:54,486 --> 00:16:55,553
>> CAN I SEE THAT?

576
00:16:55,553 --> 00:16:57,286
>> MM-HMM.

577
00:16:57,286 --> 00:16:58,719
>> THIS IS ABOUT ALL THAT

578
00:16:58,719 --> 00:17:00,686
WE CAN OFFER, I'M AFRAID.

579
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:03,153
SO IS THERE A PROBLEM?

580
00:17:03,153 --> 00:17:04,919
>> THIS IS QUITE AMAZING.

581
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,719
>> [TOGETHER] WHAT?

582
00:17:06,719 --> 00:17:08,086
>> LOOK AT THIS STUFF, GUYS.

583
00:17:08,086 --> 00:17:09,353
WASN'T THIS CABBAGE GROWN

584
00:17:09,353 --> 00:17:10,719
IN THE FIELDS HERE?

585
00:17:10,719 --> 00:17:11,986
>> AND IT HAS THE GLOW

586
00:17:11,986 --> 00:17:14,619
FROM OUR MONKEY GOD.

587
00:17:14,619 --> 00:17:16,253
>> IT'S DARK AND DAMP, JUST AS

588
00:17:16,253 --> 00:17:18,353
IT APPEARED IN MY DREAMS.

589
00:17:18,353 --> 00:17:20,019
>> SMALL AND SUFFOCATING.

590
00:17:20,019 --> 00:17:22,219
>> AND IT STUNK OF VEGETABLES!

591
00:17:22,219 --> 00:17:23,286
>> AHA!

592
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,486
THE MONKEY GOD HAS TO BE

593
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:27,019
IN THE FIELDS.

594
00:17:27,019 --> 00:17:28,586
>> HE MUST BE BURIED SOMEWHERE

595
00:17:28,586 --> 00:17:30,219
DEEP UNDERGROUND.

596
00:17:30,219 --> 00:17:31,086
>> WE'LL TURN THE VILLAGE

597
00:17:31,086 --> 00:17:32,786
UPSIDE DOWN IF WE HAVE TO.

598
00:17:32,786 --> 00:17:34,019
>> [TOGETHER] YEAH!

599
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:34,819

00:17:34,819 --> 00:17:36,386
>> PLEASE, NOT OUR FIELDS AGAIN.

601
00:17:36,386 --> 00:17:37,386
>> SIT, BOY.

602
00:17:37,386 --> 00:17:38,886

00:17:41,019 --> 00:17:44,686
IF YOU DON'T MIND.

606
00:17:44,686 --> 00:17:45,853
I KNEW IT.

607
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:47,019
THE PICKLING STONE

608
00:17:47,019 --> 00:17:49,086
IS GLOWING, TOO.

609
00:17:49,086 --> 00:17:51,086
>> THIS IS THE SACRED OBJECT.

610
00:17:51,086 --> 00:17:51,786
>> [TOGETHER] HONORABLE

>> GLOW?

613
00:17:53,619 --> 00:17:55,653
I DON'T SEE ANYTHING AT ALL.

614
00:17:55,653 --> 00:17:57,253
>> WHAT A TERRIBLE THING TO DO

615
00:17:57,253 --> 00:17:58,919
TO THE SACRED OBJECT!

616
00:17:58,919 --> 00:17:59,586
>> SEE?

617
00:17:59,586 --> 00:18:00,586
YOU DID STEAL IT,

618
00:18:00,586 --> 00:18:02,119
JUST LIKE WE SAID!

619
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:03,186
>> NOT AT ALL.

620
00:18:03,186 --> 00:18:04,653
I FOUND IT ON THE OUTSKIRTS

621
00:18:04,653 --> 00:18:05,619
OF THE VILLAGE.

622
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,519
I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE

623
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,986
A PERFECT WEIGHT FOR PICKLING.

624
00:18:07,986 --> 00:18:08,653
>> THEN YOU FOUND IT

625
00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,553
OUTSIDE OF THE FOREST?

626
00:18:10,553 --> 00:18:11,219
>> LIAR!

627
00:18:11,219 --> 00:18:12,619
THE SACRED OBJECT WAS KEPT IN

628
00:18:12,619 --> 00:18:14,786
THE SHRINE, DEEP IN THE FOREST.

629

TO TAKE THE SACRED OBJECT

635
00:18:22,819 --> 00:18:27,186
OUT OF THE BURNING SHRINE.

636
00:18:27,186 --> 00:18:28,486
WE'VE BROUGHT IT FAR ENOUGH.

637
00:18:28,486 --> 00:18:31,286
