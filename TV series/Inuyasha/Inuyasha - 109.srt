00:14:55,742 --> 00:14:59,176
KIKYO.

349
00:14:59,176 --> 00:15:03,876
>> INUYASHA.

350
00:15:03,876 --> 00:15:05,242
>> HMM.

351
00:15:05,242 --> 00:15:06,676
>> WHERE AM I?

352
00:15:06,676 --> 00:15:08,842
>> AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE.

353
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:10,742
>> I SEE.

354
00:15:10,742 --> 00:15:13,242
SO, THEN, I TAKE IT MY

355
00:15:13,242 --> 00:15:14,976
SOUL COLLECTORS WERE NOT ABLE

356
00:15:14,976 --> 00:15:17,042
TO APPROACH THE VILLAGE.

357
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:19,009
>> NO.

358
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:20,642
>> WHAT HAPPENED?

359
00:15:20,642 --> 00:15:22,009
TO THEM?

360
00:15:22,009 --> 00:15:24,542
>> THE BAND OF SEVEN?

361
00:15:24,542 --> 00:15:26,276
>> THOSE CURSED MEN WHO POSSESS

362
00:15:26,276 --> 00:15:29,176
THE DEFILED SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

363
00:15:29,176 --> 00:15:30,576
>> THEY'VE RETREATED,

364
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:31,576
BUT THEY TOOK SUIKOTSU

365
00:15:31,576 --> 00:15:34,976
WITH THEM.

366
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,076
>> I SEE.

367
00:15:39,076 --> 00:15:40,476
KAGOME?

368
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:42,242
>> YES?

369
00:15:42,242 --> 00:15:43,776
>> YOU MUST HAVE SEEN IT.

370
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,176
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD

371
00:15:45,176 --> 00:15:47,809
IN SUIKOTSU'S NECK.

372
00:15:47,809 --> 00:15:49,076
>> I DID.

373
00:15:49,076 --> 00:15:50,709
I SAW THE PURE JEWEL SHARD

374
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:53,476
BECOME CLOUDY.

375
00:15:53,476 --> 00:15:55,609
>> AND THEN HE WENT AWAY,

376
00:15:55,609 --> 00:15:57,909
DIDN'T HE?

377
00:15:57,909 --> 00:15:59,509
IT'S THIS PLACE.

378
00:15:59,509 --> 00:16:02,209
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE LAND.

379
00:16:02,209 --> 00:16:03,909
>> KIKYO, WHAT ARE YOU

380
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:06,776
TRYING TO SAY?

381
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:09,209
>> THIS LAND IS WICKED.

382
00:16:09,209 --> 00:16:10,609
IT DOES NOT ALLOW ANYONE

383
00:16:10,609 --> 00:16:13,042
WITH A DEMONIC AURA TO APPROACH.

384
00:16:13,042 --> 00:16:15,042
IT IS BECAUSE MOUNT HAKUREI

385
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,542
IS PURIFYING THE AIR

386
00:16:16,542 --> 00:16:19,409
OF THE AREAS THAT SURROUND IT.

387
00:16:19,409 --> 00:16:23,442
>> MOUNT HAKUREI.

388
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:25,209
I'VE HEARD OF IT BEFORE.

389
00:16:25,209 --> 00:16:26,342
IT IS A SACRED MOUNTAIN

390
00:16:26,342 --> 00:16:27,609
WHICH ABSOLVES AND CLEANSES

391
00:16:27,609 --> 00:16:28,776
CRIMINALS.

392
00:16:28,776 --> 00:16:30,476
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

393
00:16:30,476 --> 00:16:32,842
THE MAN KNOWN AS DR. SUIKOTSU

394
00:16:32,842 --> 00:16:34,942
WAS ABLE TO LIVE HERE BECAUSE,

395
00:16:34,942 --> 00:16:37,242
DEEP DOWN INSIDE, HE HAD A PURE,

396
00:16:37,242 --> 00:16:39,609
UNTAINTED HEART.

397
00:16:39,609 --> 00:16:41,109
>> BUT HIS OTHER PERSONALITY,

398
00:16:41,109 --> 00:16:42,909
THE SUIKOTSU WHO BELONGED TO THE

399
00:16:42,909 --> 00:16:45,242
BAND OF SEVEN, FINALLY SURFACED,

400
00:16:45,242 --> 00:16:48,209
SO HE WASN'T ABLE TO STAY HERE.

401
00:16:48,209 --> 00:16:49,242
>> SO, THEN, THE REASON THEY

402
00:16:49,242 --> 00:16:50,809
STOPPED FIGHTING AND RETREATED

403
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,942
WAS THEY WERE TOO CLOSE TO

404
00:16:51,942 --> 00:16:54,876
MOUNT HAKUREI?

405
00:16:54,876 --> 00:16:57,142
>> PURE HAS BECOME IMPURE.

406
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,142
IMPURE HAS BECOME PURE.

407
00:16:59,142 --> 00:17:00,842
GOOD IS EVIL.

408
00:17:00,842 --> 00:17:03,576
EVIL IS GOOD.

409
00:17:03,576 --> 00:17:05,942
TO LIVE IS TO DIE.

410
00:17:05,942 --> 00:17:08,742
TO DIE IS TO LIVE.

411
00:17:08,742 --> 00:17:11,576
YES, MOUNT HAKUREI IS INDEED

412
00:17:11,576 --> 00:17:13,742
TOO PURE.

413
00:17:13,742 --> 00:17:14,676
>> HMM.

414
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:17,142
MOUNT HAKUREI, HUH?

415
00:17:17,142 --> 00:17:18,676
>> SO, MIROKU, WHAT SHOULD

416
00:17:18,676 --> 00:17:19,842
WE DO?

417
00:17:19,842 --> 00:17:21,442
>> LET'S GO CHECK IT OUT.

418
00:17:21,442 --> 00:17:23,242
I'M CURIOUS.

419
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,819
>> KIKYO, WHAT ABOUT YOU?

420
00:17:33,642 --> 00:17:34,676
>> HUH.

421
00:17:34,676 --> 00:17:37,642
>> HUH?

422
00:17:37,642 --> 00:17:41,409
>> LADY KIKYO.

423
00:17:41,409 --> 00:17:44,176
>> I CHOOSE TO STAY HERE.

424
00:17:44,176 --> 00:17:45,576
I WANT TO STAY CLOSE

425
00:17:45,576 --> 00:17:48,142
TO THOSE CHILDREN FOR A WHILE.

426
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:49,409
BESIDES...

427
00:17:49,409 --> 00:17:51,309
>> YES?

428
00:17:51,309 --> 00:17:53,009
>> EVEN IF I WISH TO,

429
00:17:53,009 --> 00:17:54,509
I CANNOT GO.

430
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:56,109
>> HUH?

431
00:17:56,109 --> 00:17:59,376
>> INUYASHA, YOU SAW THEM.

432
00:17:59,376 --> 00:18:00,842
YOU SAW MY SOUL COLLECTORS

433
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:02,242
BEING REPELLED BY THE AURA

434
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,609
OF THIS LAND.

435
00:18:03,609 --> 00:18:07,642
>> HMM.

436
00:18:07,642 --> 00:18:09,509
>> IT TOOK EVERYTHING I HAD

437
00:18:09,509 --> 00:18:11,042
JUST TO STAND AT THE BASE OF

438
00:18:11,042 --> 00:18:13,576
THE MOUNTAIN.

439
00:18:13,576 --> 00:18:15,874
>> KIKYO.

440
00:18:24,909 --> 00:18:30,176
>> HMM.

441
00:18:30,176 --> 00:18:34,154
INUYASHA, DO YOU STILL...

442
00:18:52,342 --> 00:18:56,320
>> [BREATHING HEAVILY]

443
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:02,242
HEY, MIROKU.

444
00:19:02,242 --> 00:19:03,276
WHY DO YOU THING KAGOME

445
00:19:03,276 --> 00:19:04,842
IS RIDING WITH SANGO?

446
00:19:04,842 --> 00:19:05,942
>> PROBABLY BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T

447
00:19:05,942 --> 00:19:07,942
WANT TO BE CARRIED BY YOU.

448
00:19:07,942 --> 00:19:09,976
>> BUT WHAT THE HECK DID I DO?

449
00:19:09,976 --> 00:19:11,609
>> WHAT YOU DID OR DIDN'T DO

450
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:12,376
DOESN'T REALLY MATTER

451
00:19:12,376 --> 00:19:13,209
AT THIS POINT.

452
00:19:13,209 --> 00:19:14,542
KAGOME FEELS EMOTIONALLY

453
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:15,609
BETRAYED.

454
00:19:15,609 --> 00:19:17,576
WOMEN ARE VERY SENSITIVE.

455
00:19:17,576 --> 00:19:18,642
KAGOME IS HURT BECAUSE

456
00:19:18,642 --> 00:19:20,009
SHE THINKS THAT YOU MAY STILL

457
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:23,242
HAVE FEELINGS FOR KIKYO.

458
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:24,509
YOU SHOULD LEAVE HER ALONE

459
00:19:24,509 --> 00:19:25,876
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

460
00:19:25,876 --> 00:19:27,609
IT WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY

461
00:19:27,609 --> 00:19:28,642
WISE TO PROVOKE HER

462
00:19:28,642 --> 00:19:30,176
UNNECESSARILY RIGHT NOW.

463
00:19:30,176 --> 00:19:31,342
>> HUH?

464
00:19:31,342 --> 00:19:33,542
>> HEY, KAGOME!

465
00:19:33,542 --> 00:19:34,776
>> INUYASHA!

466
00:19:34,776 --> 00:19:36,042
>> IDIOT.

467
00:19:36,042 --> 00:19:37,842
>> COME ON, ANSWER ME ALREADY.

468
00:19:37,842 --> 00:19:38,709
WHY THE HECK ARE YOU

469
00:19:38,709 --> 00:19:40,242
IGNORING ME?

470
00:19:40,242 --> 00:19:42,309
HEY, KAGOME!

471
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:43,742
>> NOT NOW.

472
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:45,976
>> [GULPS] AAH!

473
00:19:45,976 --> 00:19:47,535
>> HUH?

474
00:19:53,776 --> 00:19:55,176
>> IF YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY,

475
00:19:55,176 --> 00:19:56,776
THEN LET'S HEAR IT, OK?

476
00:19:56,776 --> 00:19:57,642
>> DON'T BOTHER.

477
00:19:57,642 --> 00:19:58,309
>> COME ON.

478
00:19:58,309 --> 00:19:59,576
I KNOW YOU'RE ANGRY.

479
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,742
>> NO, I'M NOT ANGRY.

480
00:20:01,742 --> 00:20:04,042
>> GRR.

481
00:20:04,042 --> 00:20:05,842
ANYWAY, THIS IS NO TIME

482
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:07,209
FOR US TO ARGUE.

483
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:12,109
YOU REALIZE THAT, DON'T YOU?

484
00:20:12,109 --> 00:20:14,042
HMPH.

485
00:20:14,042 --> 00:20:15,876
GRR.

486
00:20:15,876 --> 00:20:16,609
UH...

487
00:20:16,609 --> 00:20:17,409
>> INUYASHA?

488
00:20:17,409 --> 00:20:18,909
>> YEAH, WHAT IS IT?

489
00:20:18,909 --> 00:20:20,042
>> WE'VE TALKED ABOUT IT BEFORE,

490
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:21,542
HAVEN'T WE?

491
00:20:21,542 --> 00:20:23,209
ABOUT ME STAYING WITH YOU.

492
00:20:23,209 --> 00:20:24,542
>> UH...

493
00:20:24,542 --> 00:20:25,942
>> I KNOW THAT THERE'S A BOND

494
00:20:25,942 --> 00:20:28,009
BETWEEN YOU AND KIKYO,

495
00:20:28,009 --> 00:20:29,742
AND I KNOW I CAN'T EVER ASK YOU

496
00:20:29,742 --> 00:20:33,842
TO FORGET ABOUT HER.

497
00:20:33,842 --> 00:20:35,476
AND YET...

498
00:20:35,476 --> 00:20:37,209
I'M GOING TO STAND BY YOU,

499
00:20:37,209 --> 00:20:38,576
INUYASHA.

500
00:20:38,576 --> 00:20:42,009
IT'S WHAT I KNOW I HAVE TO DO.

501
00:20:42,009 --> 00:20:42,909
>> HMM.

502
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:45,576
KAGOME.

503
00:20:45,576 --> 00:20:46,942
>> SO, I'M NOT GOING TO WORRY

504
00:20:46,942 --> 00:20:49,309
ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

505
00:20:49,309 --> 00:20:51,742
>> UH...

506
00:20:51,742 --> 00:20:53,176
>> THERE'S ONE THING, THOUGH.

507
00:20:53,176 --> 00:20:53,942
>> HMM?

508
00:20:53,942 --> 00:20:54,876
>> WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO PICK

509
00:20:54,876 --> 00:20:56,176
A FIGHT WITH ME?

510
00:20:56,176 --> 00:20:57,142
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST

511
00:20:57,142 --> 00:20:59,209
LEAVE ME ALONE?

512
00:20:59,209 --> 00:21:00,042
>> UHH!

513
00:21:00,042 --> 00:21:02,142
>> THIS IS ALREADY HARD ENOUGH!

514
00:21:02,142 --> 00:21:02,976
>> UHH!

515
00:21:02,976 --> 00:21:05,842
>> AAH!

516
00:21:05,842 --> 00:21:06,609
>> HEY, WAIT.

517
00:21:06,609 --> 00:21:07,342
I WAS RIGHT.

518
00:21:07,342 --> 00:21:08,742
YOU ARE ANGRY AFTER ALL.

519
00:21:08,742 --> 00:21:09,409
