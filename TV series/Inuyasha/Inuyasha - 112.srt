173
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:32,781
HIS LIFE, SO THERE HAS TO BE A

174
00:07:32,781 --> 00:07:34,114
REASON FOR HIS FAILURE TO

175
00:07:34,114 --> 00:07:35,214
RETURN.

176
00:07:35,214 --> 00:07:36,814
>> YES, MY SISTERS AND I ARE

177
00:07:36,814 --> 00:07:38,048
EQUALLY WORRIED ABOUT OUR

178
00:07:38,048 --> 00:07:39,181
FATHER.

179
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,214
>> AND THE VILLAGERS FEAR THERE

180
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:41,714
MAY BE A CURSE.

181
00:07:41,714 --> 00:07:43,648
>> WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

182
00:07:43,648 --> 00:07:45,314
>> LET'S CHECK IT OUT, INUYASHA.

183
00:07:45,314 --> 00:07:47,014
>> YEAH, SOMETHING DOESN'T SOUND

184
00:07:47,014 --> 00:07:48,948
RIGHT ABOUT THAT ISLAND.

185
00:07:48,948 --> 00:07:49,881
>> YOU'LL GO THEN?

186
00:07:49,881 --> 00:07:51,214
YOU WOULD DO THAT FOR ME?

187

>> OF COURSE WE WILL.

188
00:07:52,348 --> 00:07:53,481
IT'S ONLY NATURAL FOR YOU TO

189
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,614
WORRY ABOUT YOUR FATHER, AFTER

190
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:56,181
ALL.

191
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,314
>> THANK YOU, FRIENDS.

192
00:07:57,314 --> 00:07:58,914
I WILL GUIDE YOU ACROSS THE LAKE

193
00:07:58,914 --> 00:08:00,414
TO THE ISLAND.

194
00:08:00,414 --> 00:08:01,781
THE AREA IS ALWAYS SHROUDED IN

195
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:03,214
MIST, AND IT'S DANGEROUS IF YOU

196
00:08:03,214 --> 00:08:04,881
DO NOT KNOW YOUR WAY THERE.

197
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:06,114

CONCERN FOR YOU.

203
00:08:14,281 --> 00:08:15,781
IF YOU'LL OBLIGE ME, I WOULD BE

204
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:16,881
MORE THAN WILLING TO HELP YOU

SORRY ABOUT THIS.

IT.

276
00:10:25,948 --> 00:10:27,148
TELL THE BOATMEN?

277

NOT AS STRONG THOUGH, BY THE

00:10:57,481 --> 00:10:58,863
LOOKS OF IT.

293
00:11:07,348 --> 00:11:09,981
NOW I'M SURE OF IT.

294
00:11:09,981 --> 00:11:13,281
IT'S THESE FLOWERS.

295
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:14,548
THEY SMELL JUST LIKE NARAKU'S

296

DEMON PUPPET.

297
00:11:16,514 --> 00:11:17,414

FLOWERS LIKE THESE GROWING

299
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:23,348
AROUND HERE.

301
00:11:25,381 --> 00:11:27,481

CONVENIENT.

306
00:11:35,314 --> 00:11:39,414
WHY WOULD NARAKU DO THIS?

307
00:11:39,414 --> 00:11:40,581
WHY WOULD HE CREATE A DEMON

308
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:42,314
PUPPET MERELY TO HELP THE BAND

309

OF 7 ESCAPE...

310
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:49,448
AND THEN LEAVE THE STRONG SCENT

311
00:11:49,448 --> 00:11:51,181
OF THESE FLOWERS?

312
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:52,114
IT'S LIKE THEY WERE LEFT TO LURE

313

318
00:12:14,948 --> 00:12:18,581
FATHER'S CLOTHING.

319
00:12:18,581 --> 00:12:21,481
IT'S MY FATHER!

DEMONS DID THIS.

327
00:12:30,548 --> 00:12:32,614
>> YEAH, NOW I'M ALMOST POSITIVE

328
00:12:32,614 --> 00:12:33,481
OF IT.

329
00:12:33,481 --> 00:12:35,781
>> OK, BUT FOR WHAT REASON?

330
00:12:35,781 --> 00:12:37,548
>> WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES THIS

331
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,870
ISLAND SO SPECIAL?

332
00:12:43,948 --> 00:12:49,414

IT'S ABOUT TIME YOU SHOWED UP--

335
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:55,130
MAKING ME WAIT SO LONG IN HERE.

336
00:13:00,114 --> 00:13:01,814
THIS PLACE MAKES EVEN A HUMAN

337
00:13:01,814 --> 00:13:03,581
LIKE ME FEEL SICK.

338
00:13:03,581 --> 00:13:04,881
IT MUST BE EVEN MORE TRYING FOR

339
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:07,448
A HALF-DEMON, RIGHT, INUYASHA?

340

>> DAMN.

342
00:13:09,881 --> 00:13:12,981
IT WAS A TRAP.

343
00:13:12,981 --> 00:13:16,581
DID YOU DO ALL THIS, BANKOTSU?

344
00:13:16,581 --> 00:13:18,448
>> DON'T LOOK AT ME.

345
00:13:18,448 --> 00:13:20,681
I WAS ONLY TOLD TO WAIT HERE,

346
00:13:20,681 --> 00:13:25,214
NOTHING MORE THAN THAT.

347
00:13:25,214 --> 00:13:27,148
>> CAREFUL AROUND HIM, INUYASHA.

348
00:13:27,148 --> 00:13:28,648
BANKOTSU'S HALBERD HAS SACRED

349
00:13:28,648 --> 00:13:32,381
JEWEL SHARDS IN IT.

350
00:13:32,381 --> 00:13:33,181
>> THAT'S RIGHT.

351
00:13:33,181 --> 00:13:34,548
IT GOT SCARRED DURING OUR LITTLE

352
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,614
MATCH THE OTHER DAY, SO I USED

353
00:13:36,614 --> 00:13:40,781
THE JEWEL SHARDS TO REPAIR IT.

354
00:13:40,781 --> 00:13:42,881
NOW, LET'S FINISH THIS OFF,

355
00:13:42,881 --> 00:13:45,981
INUYASHA!

356
00:13:45,981 --> 00:13:47,148
>> THIS TIME I'M GOING TO CUT

357
00:13:47,148 --> 00:13:49,210
YOU TO PIECES!

358
00:13:53,548 --> 00:13:54,714
>> I'LL BE THE ONE DOING THE

359
00:13:54,714 --> 00:13:56,976
DAMAGE, HALF-DEMON.

360
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:10,381
>> BANKOTSU HAS THE UPPER HAND.

361
00:14:10,381 --> 00:14:11,881
>> BECAUSE OF THE SHIKON SHARDS

362
00:14:11,881 --> 00:14:16,981
IN BANKOTSU'S HALBERD.

363
00:14:16,981 --> 00:14:18,781
>> DAMN IT.

364
00:14:18,781 --> 00:14:20,248
I'M SICK OF YOU.

365
00:14:20,248 --> 00:14:26,148
WIND SCAR!

366
00:14:26,148 --> 00:14:27,710
>> WHAT?

367
00:14:34,314 --> 00:14:36,614
>> WHAT?

368
00:14:36,614 --> 00:14:38,381
WHAT HAPPENED?

369
00:14:38,381 --> 00:14:39,214
>> WHAT HAPPENED TO THE WIND

370
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,248
SCAR?

371
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:42,948
WHERE IS IT?

372
00:14:42,948 --> 00:14:44,114
>> NOW IT MAKES SENSE.

373
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:45,414
NO WONDER HE TOLD ME TO FIGHT

374
00:14:45,414 --> 00:14:47,015
YOU HERE.

375
00:14:53,148 --> 00:14:54,214
>> WHY CAN'T HE USE THE WIND

376
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,148
SCAR?

377
00:14:55,148 --> 00:14:56,048
>> I BELIEVE IT'S BECAUSE THE

378
00:14:56,048 --> 00:14:57,414
TETSUSAIGA'S DEMONIC POWER IS

379
00:14:57,414 --> 00:15:01,214
BEING PURIFIED BY HIJIRI ISLAND.

380
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:03,014
FURTHERMORE, NO MATTER HOW EVIL

381
00:15:03,014 --> 00:15:04,648
BANKOTSU'S SPIRIT MAY BE, HE WAS

382
00:15:04,648 --> 00:15:07,281
STILL A MERE HUMAN IN LIFE.

383
00:15:07,281 --> 00:15:08,981
INUYASHA HAS DEMON BLOOD IN HIM,

384
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:10,281
AND IN COMPARISON, THE EFFECT OF

385
00:15:10,281 --> 00:15:11,748
HIJIRI ISLAND ON BANKOTSU IS

386
00:15:11,748 --> 00:15:12,781
MINIMAL.

387
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:14,281
>> INUYASHA, YOU'RE SO MUCH

388
00:15:14,281 --> 00:15:15,581
WEAKER THAN THE LAST TIME WE

389
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:18,248
FOUGHT EACH OTHER.

390
00:15:18,248 --> 00:15:20,781
SURRENDER AND DIE.

391
00:15:20,781 --> 00:15:21,781
I DON'T WANT TO STAY ON THIS

392
00:15:21,781 --> 00:15:23,514
MISERABLE ISLAND A MINUTE LONGER

393
00:15:23,514 --> 00:15:25,456
THAN I HAVE TO.

394
00:15:37,748 --> 00:15:39,014
>> SOMEONE HAS TO BE PUTTING UP

395
00:15:39,014 --> 00:15:40,548
THIS PURIFYING BARRIER, I KNOW

396
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:44,248
IT.

397
00:15:44,248 --> 00:15:45,714
JUST AS I THOUGHT.

398
00:15:45,714 --> 00:15:47,155
IT'S OVER THERE.

399
00:16:01,248 --> 00:16:06,681
>> SHINTARO!

400
00:16:06,681 --> 00:16:08,548
>> SAINT HAKUSHIN, PLEASE COME

401
00:16:08,548 --> 00:16:11,150
TO INUYASHA'S ASSISTANCE!

402
00:16:15,181 --> 00:16:19,848
THAT STAFF, IT'S FATHER'S!

403
00:16:19,848 --> 00:16:22,548
>> SHINTARO.

404
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,581
>> SAINT HAKUSHIN ISN'T HERE.

405
00:16:24,581 --> 00:16:25,614
HE'S GONE.

406
00:16:25,614 --> 00:16:26,414
>> WHAT?

407
00:16:26,414 --> 00:16:27,448
HOW COULD THAT BE?

408
00:16:27,448 --> 00:16:33,348
>> HIS BODY WAS ENSHRINED HERE.

409
00:16:33,348 --> 00:16:35,248
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

410
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:36,348
DOES THIS MEAN NARAKU ATTACKED

411
00:16:36,348 --> 00:16:37,914
THIS ISLAND TO STEAL THE SAINT'S

412
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:40,848
BODY?

413
00:16:40,848 --> 00:16:43,481
MIROKU, SAINT HAKUSHIN'S MUMMY

414
00:16:43,481 --> 00:16:45,448
HAS GONE MISSING FROM THE TOMB.

415
00:16:45,448 --> 00:16:47,281
NARAKU MAY HAVE STOLEN IT.

416
00:16:47,281 --> 00:16:49,481
>> SOMEONE'S STOLEN THE BODY?

417
00:16:49,481 --> 00:16:50,614
THEN IT WASN'T SAINT HAKUSHIN

418
00:16:50,614 --> 00:16:54,514
WHO PUT UP THE BARRIER.

419
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,481
IF IT WASN'T SAINT HAKUSHIN,

420
00:16:56,481 --> 00:16:58,281
THEN WHO DID PUT UP THE BARRIER

421
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:00,562
ON HIJIRI ISLAND?

422
00:17:20,835 --> 00:17:23,135
>> INUYASHA!

423
00:17:23,135 --> 00:17:27,902
>> DAMN.

424
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:29,169
>> WHAT DO YOU THINK?

425
00:17:29,169 --> 00:17:31,435
>> WELL, ALL THIS TIME I WAS

426
00:17:31,435 --> 00:17:33,202
CONVINCED THAT SAINT HAKUSHIN

427
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:34,369
WAS THE ONE PUTTING UP THIS

428
00:17:34,369 --> 00:17:36,102
BARRIER AROUND THE ISLAND.

429
00:17:36,102 --> 00:17:37,502
>> BARRIER?

430
00:17:37,502 --> 00:17:38,869
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

431
00:17:38,869 --> 00:17:40,035
SAINT HAKUSHIN WAS SOMEONE WHO

432
00:17:40,035 --> 00:17:41,435
SAVED PEOPLE.

433
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:43,502
WHY WOULD HE PUT UP A BARRIER?

434
00:17:43,502 --> 00:17:44,402
>> YOU REMEMBER THE STRANGE

435
00:17:44,402 --> 00:17:45,602
LIGHT YOU AND YOUR FATHER SAW,

436
00:17:45,602 --> 00:17:46,702
SHINTARO?

437
00:17:46,702 --> 00:17:49,169
IT WAS A DEMON NAMED NARAKU.

438
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:50,569
>> NARAKU?

439
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:51,802
>> YES, YOU SEE, I'M CERTAIN

440
00:17:51,802 --> 00:17:52,835
THAT YOUR FATHER MUST HAVE

441
00:17:52,835 --> 00:17:54,202
FOUGHT NARAKU AND TRIED TO

442
00:17:54,202 --> 00:17:56,043
PROTECT THE SAINT.

443
00:18:24,435 --> 00:18:26,796
>> SAINT HAKUSHIN, SAVE ME!

444
00:18:34,435 --> 00:18:37,202
>> THEN THAT SKELETON REALLY WAS

445
00:18:37,202 --> 00:18:38,669
MY FATHER.

446
00:18:38,669 --> 00:18:39,969
>> NARAKU WANTED TO USE SAINT

447
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,302
HAKUSHIN'S IMMENSE SPIRITUAL

448
00:18:41,302 --> 00:18:41,969
POWER.

449
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:42,835
THAT'S WHY HE CAME TO THE

450
00:18:42,835 --> 00:18:44,269
ISLAND.

451
00:18:44,269 --> 00:18:45,302
AND I'M GUESSING THAT WHEN YOUR

452
00:18:45,302 --> 00:18:46,902
FATHER DISCOVERED THAT, HE TRIED

453
00:18:46,902 --> 00:18:49,069
TO STOP HIM.

454
00:18:49,069 --> 00:18:50,135
>> THAT IS THE DUTY OF THE

455
00:18:50,135 --> 00:18:52,769
VILLAGE HEADMAN.

456
00:18:52,769 --> 00:18:54,069
SO FATHER DIDN'T DIE BECAUSE HE

457
00:18:54,069 --> 00:18:55,669
WAS CURSED.

458
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:57,335
THAT'S RIGHT, ISN'T IT?

459
00:18:57,335 --> 00:19:01,435
>> OF COURSE.

460
00:19:01,435 --> 00:19:02,935
>> IF SAINT HAKUSHIN ISN'T IN

461
00:19:02,935 --> 00:19:04,469
THE SHRINE ANY LONGER, THEN

462
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:06,602
WHERE ON EARTH IS HE?

463
00:19:06,602 --> 00:19:08,724
AND WHO PUT UP THE BARRIER?

464
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:15,102
>> DAMN IT.

465
00:19:15,102 --> 00:19:20,535
>> ONE LAST STRIKE.

466
00:19:20,535 --> 00:19:21,735
THIS IS THE END FOR YOU,

467
00:19:21,735 --> 00:19:23,296
INUYASHA!

468
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,835
>> INUYASHA, WE JUST NEED YOU TO

469
00:19:30,835 --> 00:19:31,802
HOLD HIM OFF A LITTLE BIT

470
00:19:31,802 --> 00:19:36,202
LONGER!

471
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:37,569
NOW, IF I CAN FIND THE CORE OF

472
00:19:37,569 --> 00:19:38,835
THE BARRIER.

473
00:19:38,835 --> 00:19:39,902
SHIPPO, I NEED TO USE YOUR

474
00:19:39,902 --> 00:19:41,203
POWERS.

475
00:19:49,035 --> 00:19:50,569
SHIPPO'S DEMONIC POWERS HAVE

476
00:19:50,569 --> 00:19:51,769
BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE SUTRA

477
00:19:51,769 --> 00:19:52,869
CHARMS.

478
00:19:52,869 --> 00:19:56,502
IT SHOULD PRODUCE A REACTION.

479
00:19:56,502 --> 00:19:57,669
THEY'VE BEEN PURIFIED.

480
00:19:57,669 --> 00:19:59,911
IT'S OVER THERE.

481
00:20:11,702 --> 00:20:13,069
>> I'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE.

482
00:20:13,069 --> 00:20:14,135
IT'S AN ALTAR ORNAMENT SAINT

483
00:20:14,135 --> 00:20:15,935
HAKUSHIN ALWAYS USED.

484
00:20:15,935 --> 00:20:21,869
>> SO THIS IS IT.

485
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:23,335
>> I'LL USE THIS STAFF THE SAINT

486
00:20:23,335 --> 00:20:24,535
ONCE OWNED AND WE'LL TRY IT

487
00:20:24,535 --> 00:20:25,669
TOGETHER.

488
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:30,202
>> MIROKU.

489
00:20:30,202 --> 00:20:32,284
>> LET'S GIVE IT A SHOT, THEN.

490
00:20:40,869 --> 00:20:42,402
>> GIVE ME STRENGTH TO SUCCEED,

491
00:20:42,402 --> 00:20:43,923
FATHER.

492
00:21:17,469 --> 00:21:20,130
>> THE FLOWERS HAVE DISAPPEARED.

493
00:21:24,135 --> 00:21:25,902
>> THE WIND SCAR IS BACK.

494
00:21:25,902 --> 00:21:28,902
THE BARRIER IS BROKEN.

495
00:21:28,902 --> 00:21:30,235
>> THIS ORNAMENT MUST BE WHAT

496
00:21:30,235 --> 00:21:31,769
CREATED THE BARRIER.

497
00:21:31,769 --> 00:21:33,135
>> BUT THIS VAJRA WAS LOCKED UP

498
00:21:33,135 --> 00:21:35,235
INSIDE THE TEMPLE.

499
00:21:35,235 --> 00:21:36,602
>> IT CAN'T BE.

500
00:21:36,602 --> 00:21:37,635
DOES THIS MEAN THAT SAINT

501
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:40,697
HAKUSHIN IS HELPING NARAKU?

502
00:21:44,969 --> 00:21:46,035
>> DON'T THINK THIS WILL SAVE

503
00:21:46,035 --> 00:21:48,169
YOU, INUYASHA, BECAUSE AS YOU

504
00:21:48,169 --> 00:21:49,702
SEE, I'M FEELING MUCH STRONGER

505
00:21:49,702 --> 00:21:51,335
NOW, TOO, NOW THAT THAT

506
00:21:51,335 --> 00:21:52,902
DISGUSTING BARRIER IS FINALLY

507
00:21:52,902 --> 00:21:55,835
GONE.

508
00:21:55,835 --> 00:21:57,002
THE BARRIER'S GONE AND OUR

509
00:21:57,002 --> 00:22:01,169
POWERS HAVE RETURNED TO NORMAL.

510
00:22:01,169 --> 00:22:02,435
