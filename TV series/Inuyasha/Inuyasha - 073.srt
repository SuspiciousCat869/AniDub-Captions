HE DID NOT KILL HUMANS,

YOU SEE, HE AND SHIORI'S FATHER

WERE GUARDIANS OF THE BARRIER,

A DUTY PASSED DOWN

SHIORI HAD INHERITED
HIS GUARDIAN POWERS.

THEN HOW COME--

THE BARRIER WANES WITH AGE,

HE LOSES THE POWER.

RELATED BY BLOOD.

HAD ANY PROBLEMS

THAT'S ONLY BECAUSE
I PROTECT YOU BOTH.

BREAK THROUGH THE BARRIER.

- EVEN I KNOW THAT MUCH.

336
00:19:11,063 --> 00:19:14,597
- KILL A HALF-DEMON WHO
GENERATES A STRONG BARRIER

337
00:19:14,630 --> 00:19:16,563
AND LET TETSUSAIGA
SUCK ITS BLOOD?

338
00:19:16,597 --> 00:19:18,263
THEN THE SWORD WILL
GROW IN POWER

THROUGH NARAKU'S BARRIER.
