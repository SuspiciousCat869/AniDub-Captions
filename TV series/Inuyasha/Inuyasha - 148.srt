1
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:13,370
>> KIKYO.

2
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,704
IT'S YOU.

3
00:00:14,704 --> 00:00:15,370
>> YES.

4
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,204
I BROUGHT SOME GRUEL FOR YOU.

5
00:00:18,204 --> 00:00:21,370
>> FORGET ME.

6
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:26,037
DON'T EVEN BOTHER COMING.

7
00:00:26,037 --> 00:00:29,037
GO AWAY.

8
00:00:29,037 --> 00:00:30,870
>> KIKYO WAS SECRETLY HARBORING

9
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,204
A BANDIT NAMED ONIGUMO.

10
00:00:37,204 --> 00:00:39,037
>> WHY CAN'T I TELL INUYASHA

11
00:00:39,037 --> 00:00:40,370
ABOUT IT?

12
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,870
>> KNOWING HIM, HE'LL PROBABLY

13
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:43,537
JUST BECOME JEALOUS.

14
00:00:43,537 --> 00:00:48,870
>> JEALOUS?

15
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,204
>> INUYASHA, I NEED YOUR HELP.

16
00:00:51,204 --> 00:00:52,037
>> HOW COME?

17
00:00:52,037 --> 00:00:53,470
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

18
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,704
>> I'VE BEEN ASKED TO SLAY

19
00:00:54,704 --> 00:00:56,704
A DEMON FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY,

20
00:00:56,704 --> 00:00:58,204
BUT EVEN FOR ME IT WILL BE

21
00:00:58,204 --> 00:00:59,704
A DIFFICULT MISSION.

22
00:00:59,704 --> 00:01:00,970
>> OH, ALL RIGHT,

23
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:06,804
BUT IT'S GONNA COST YOU.

24
00:01:06,804 --> 00:01:07,837
>> INUYASHA, IT'S COMING

25
00:01:07,837 --> 00:01:08,537
YOUR WAY!

26
00:01:08,537 --> 00:01:10,304
>> LEAVE HIM TO ME.

27
00:01:10,304 --> 00:01:13,537
IRON REAVER SOUL STEALER!

28
00:01:13,537 --> 00:01:14,637
KIKYO, THAT'S THE DEMON'S

29
00:01:14,637 --> 00:01:15,537
TRUE FORM.

30
00:01:15,537 --> 00:01:20,804
>> RIGHT.

31
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:29,170
>> HA, RIGHT ON TARGET.

32
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:30,370
>> YOU--

33
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:31,704
YOUNG LASS.

34
00:01:31,704 --> 00:01:33,137
>> IT'S KAEDE.

35
00:01:33,137 --> 00:01:34,404
>> YES.

36
00:01:34,404 --> 00:01:35,904
YOUR SISTER POSSESSES WHAT

37
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:38,004
IS KNOWN AS THE SHIKON JEWEL,

38
00:01:38,004 --> 00:01:39,237
DOES SHE NOT?

39
00:01:39,237 --> 00:01:40,170
>> WHAT WOULD YE KNOW ABOUT

40
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:42,137
THE JEWEL?

41
00:01:42,137 --> 00:01:44,504
>> ALL WHO ARE WICKED KNOW OF IT

42
00:01:44,504 --> 00:01:45,637
AND PURSUE IT.

43
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:46,570
>> YE INCLUDED?

44
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:48,204
>> I UNDERSTAND THAT THE MORE

45
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:50,337
EVIL THE JEWEL ABSORBS,

46
00:01:50,337 --> 00:01:52,304
THE MORE EVIL IT BECOMES.

47
00:01:52,304 --> 00:01:53,504
OUTSTANDING.

48
00:01:53,504 --> 00:01:54,604
>> MY SISTER HAS IT UNDER HER

49
00:01:54,604 --> 00:01:55,437
CONTROL.

50
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:57,537
IT WON'T BE CORRUPTED.

51
00:01:57,537 --> 00:01:58,570
>> KIKYO'S MANNER IS

52
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,037
SELF-RIGHTEOUS.

53
00:02:00,037 --> 00:02:01,537
FOR ONCE, I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE

54
00:02:01,537 --> 00:02:03,837
HER APPREHENSIVE AND FRIGHTENED.

55
00:02:03,837 --> 00:02:05,237
THAT WOULD BRING ME TRUE

56
00:02:05,237 --> 00:02:06,904
PLEASURE.

57
00:02:06,904 --> 00:02:09,021
HEH HEH HEH.

58
00:02:17,863 --> 00:02:19,330
>> I SEE.

59
00:02:19,330 --> 00:02:21,730
ONIGUMO SAID THAT, DID HE?

60
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:22,997
>> BIG SISTER, I DON'T CARE

61
00:02:22,997 --> 00:02:24,530
FOR THAT MAN.

62
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,097
>> BEAR HIM NO GRUDGE.

63
00:02:26,097 --> 00:02:27,430
GIVE HIM PITY.

64
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,430
HIS INJURIES ARE GREAT.

65
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:30,930
HE SHALL NEVER MOVE FROM THERE

66
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:32,530
AGAIN.

67
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:34,363
>> THAT IS WHAT KIKYO HAD TO SAY

68
00:02:34,363 --> 00:02:37,030
ABOUT THE INCIDENT, BUT I FELT

69
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:38,530
A STRONG FOREBODING ABOUT

70
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:45,697
HER KINDNESS.

71
00:02:45,697 --> 00:02:48,197
>> WHAT A LOVELY SIGHT.

72
00:02:48,197 --> 00:02:49,963
HOWEVER, I UNDERSTAND IF YOU

73
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:51,397
REMAIN BENEATH THE CHERRY TREES

74
00:02:51,397 --> 00:02:52,630
FOR TOO LONG, YOU WILL GO

75
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,363
INSANE.

76
00:02:54,363 --> 00:02:55,297
IS IT THE TREES THAT ARE

77
00:02:55,297 --> 00:02:56,430
CHANGING YOU?

78
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,497
YOU SEEM LIKE A COMPLETELY

79
00:02:57,497 --> 00:02:58,630
DIFFERENT PERSON FROM WHEN

80
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:00,697
I LAST SAW YOU.

81
00:03:00,697 --> 00:03:02,263
AND WHAT OF YOUR PITIFULLY WEAK

82
00:03:02,263 --> 00:03:03,530
POWERS?

83
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:05,263
SPECTERS AND DEMONS ARE IN THEIR

84
00:03:05,263 --> 00:03:07,663
HEYDAY, ALL OF THEM BREAKING

85
00:03:07,663 --> 00:03:13,630
THROUGH YOUR BARRIER.

86
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,630
>> I SEE.

87
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,963
SO YOU WERE THE ONE UNLEASHING

88
00:03:15,963 --> 00:03:18,130
DEMONS AROUND ME.

89
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:19,130
>> I WARNED YOU NOT TO LET

90
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:20,963
YOUR HEART GO TO A MAN.

91
00:03:20,963 --> 00:03:22,963
HE IS THAT WORTHLESS HALF-DEMON,

92
00:03:22,963 --> 00:03:27,763
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN.

93
00:03:27,763 --> 00:03:29,497
GIVE ME THE SACRED JEWEL.

94
00:03:29,497 --> 00:03:34,130
I SHALL PURIFY IT IN YOUR PLACE.

95
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,230
>> YOU DON'T HAVE THE POWER TO.

96
00:03:38,230 --> 00:03:38,963
>> HA!

97
00:03:38,963 --> 00:03:49,130
DIE, KIKYO!

98
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:54,630
AAH!

99
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,730
DAMN YOU, KIKYO.

100
00:03:57,730 --> 00:03:59,630
>> NOW LEAVE, AND I WILL SPARE

101
00:03:59,630 --> 00:04:12,897
YOUR LIFE.

102
00:04:12,897 --> 00:04:15,730
>> ONIGUMO.

103
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,230
ONIGUMO.

104
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:21,397
YOUR EVIL THOUGHTS HAVE BROUGHT

105
00:04:21,397 --> 00:04:23,163
US HERE.

106
00:04:23,163 --> 00:04:25,663
>> A DEMON.

107
00:04:25,663 --> 00:04:29,663
>> TELL ME, WHAT IS IT YOU WANT?

108
00:04:29,663 --> 00:04:31,230
>> I MUST POSSESS MY FORMER

109
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:32,563
MOBILITY, THEN THE JEWEL

110
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,563
WILL BE MINE, NOT TO MENTION

111
00:04:34,563 --> 00:04:39,063
THE LOVELY MAIDEN KIKYO.

112
00:04:39,063 --> 00:04:40,063
>> DONE.

113
00:04:40,063 --> 00:04:42,063
BUT IN RETURN, WE WILL TAKE

114
00:04:42,063 --> 00:04:44,663
YOUR SOUL.

115
00:04:44,663 --> 00:04:47,163
>> HEH HEH.

116
00:04:47,163 --> 00:04:49,297
MY SOUL IS RANCID TO THE CORE,

117
00:04:49,297 --> 00:04:51,730
YET IT STILL HOLDS VALUE.

118
00:04:51,730 --> 00:04:54,397
FEAST ON MY FLESH.

119
00:04:54,397 --> 00:04:55,730
FEAST ON ME, DEMONS.

120
00:04:55,730 --> 00:04:57,230
DEVOUR ME!

121
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:00,397
AND IN EXCHANGE, BESTOW ME WITH

122
00:05:00,397 --> 00:05:04,263
YOUR MOBILITY AND STRENGTH!

123
00:05:04,263 --> 00:05:20,663
[SCREAMING]

124
00:05:20,663 --> 00:05:22,330
>> YOU'VE IMPROVED CONSIDERABLY.

125
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:23,830
>> THANKS.

126
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:25,663
>> NEXT IS THE ARROW OF SEALING.

127
00:05:25,663 --> 00:05:40,063
>> ARROW OF SEALING?

128
00:05:40,063 --> 00:05:41,163
>> THAT WAS THE ARROW

129
00:05:41,163 --> 00:05:42,330
OF SEALING.

130
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:43,430
WE USE IT FOR DEMONS WHO ARE

131
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:45,097
OTHERWISE INVINCIBLE.

132
00:05:45,097 --> 00:05:45,963
>> AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS

133
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:47,263
TO THE DEMON?

134
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:48,563
>> THEY FALL INTO AN ETERNAL

135

SLEEP.

136
00:05:50,997 --> 00:05:52,497
THEY WILL ONLY AWAKEN

137
00:05:52,497 --> 00:05:54,163
WHEN THE ONE WHO SHOT THE ARROW

138
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:55,730
DEEPLY WISHES FOR THE DEMON

139
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,197
TO REVIVE.

140
00:05:58,197 --> 00:05:59,863
I WARN YOU, THOUGH,

141
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:01,563
BEWARE OF THIS TREE.

142
00:06:01,563 --> 00:06:02,230
>> HUH?

143
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:03,530
THE SACRED TREE?

144
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,597
>> IT'S KNOWN AS THE TREE

145
00:06:04,597 --> 00:06:05,730
OF AGES.

146
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,097
IT HAS THE POWER TO TRANSCEND

147
00:06:07,097 --> 00:06:07,930
TIME.

148
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:09,763

>> IF YOU SEAL A DEMON ONTO THIS

150

151
00:06:12,930 --> 00:06:15,263
REMAIN PERFECTLY INTACT.

152
00:06:15,263 --> 00:06:18,930
HUH?

153
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:20,263
>> WHAT'S THAT?

154
00:06:20,263 --> 00:06:22,097
>> THERE ARE SO MANY OF THEM.

155
00:06:22,097 --> 00:06:23,763
OH, HOW COULD I NOT HAVE NOTICED

156
00:06:23,763 --> 00:06:26,830
SUCH A STRONG AURA?

157
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:28,263

158
00:06:28,263 --> 00:06:31,930
GO AND TAKE THE SACRED JEWEL.

159
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,430
THE SACRED JEWEL WILL GIVE YOU

160

IMMENSE DEMONIC POWER.

161
00:06:35,597 --> 00:06:36,930
BECOME THE GREATEST DEMONS

00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,091
>> KIKYO?

347
00:15:14,091 --> 00:15:15,725
SHE'S NOT HERE YET.

348
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:17,058
>> AH, HA HA.

349
00:15:17,058 --> 00:15:20,191
SO YOU'VE COME, HALF-DEMON.

350
00:15:20,191 --> 00:15:21,725
>> WH--WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY,

351
00:15:21,725 --> 00:15:23,458
KIKYO?

352
00:15:23,458 --> 00:15:25,658
>> I SAID, "HALF-DEMON."

353
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:26,958
CAN'T THOSE UGLY DOG EARS

354
00:15:26,958 --> 00:15:31,191
OF YOURS HEAR WHAT I SAY?

355
00:15:31,191 --> 00:15:33,191
>> UGLY DOG?

356
00:15:33,191 --> 00:15:35,125
>> I CAN'T LET A HALF-DEMON

357
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:38,191
LIKE YOU HAVE THE SACRED JEWEL.

358
00:15:38,191 --> 00:15:41,758
I WILL DESTROY YOU HERE AND NOW.

359
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:43,758
DIE, INUYASHA!

360
00:15:43,758 --> 00:15:45,758
BE GONE, HALF-DEMON!

361
00:15:45,758 --> 00:15:47,091
>> DAMN IT!

362
00:15:47,091 --> 00:15:48,925
>> HEH HEH HEH.

363
00:15:48,925 --> 00:15:50,425
NOW THE SACRED JEWEL WILL

364
00:15:50,425 --> 00:15:52,591
BE TAINTED WITH HATRED

365
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:58,125
AND BITTERNESS.

366
00:15:58,125 --> 00:15:59,125
>> DAMN.

367
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:00,525
YOU MEAN ALL THIS TIME YOU WERE

368
00:16:00,525 --> 00:16:03,925
JUST USING ME?

369
00:16:03,925 --> 00:16:05,358
>> THEN TELL ME YOUR NAME,

370
00:16:05,358 --> 00:16:06,691
AND I SHALL NEVER CALL YOU

371
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,358
HALF-DEMON AGAIN.

372
00:16:08,358 --> 00:16:10,025
>> THAT'S WHAT YOU SAID,

373
00:16:10,025 --> 00:16:18,358
AND YET--WHY NOW?

374
00:16:18,358 --> 00:16:25,691
>> AAH!

375
00:16:25,691 --> 00:16:28,591
>> HA HA.

376
00:16:28,591 --> 00:16:33,425
HMM.

377
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:35,391
HEH, SO THERE.

378
00:16:35,391 --> 00:16:37,191
FINALLY, A WAY FOR ME TO BECOME

379
00:16:37,191 --> 00:16:38,691
ALL DEMON AT LAST.

380
00:16:38,691 --> 00:16:40,691
HA, I WON'T LET ANYONE CALL ME

381
00:16:40,691 --> 00:16:44,291
A HALF-DEMON AGAIN!

382
00:16:44,291 --> 00:16:48,358
>> DIE, INUYASHA!

383
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:50,025
I BELIEVED IN YOU.

384
00:16:50,025 --> 00:16:53,191
I TRUSTED YOU.

385
00:16:53,191 --> 00:16:54,858
>> I NEVER DOUBTED YOU,

386
00:16:54,858 --> 00:16:56,358
NOT FOR A MINUTE!

387
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:59,691
YET YOU DECEIVED ME.

388
00:16:59,691 --> 00:17:17,625
>> INUYASHA!

389
00:17:17,625 --> 00:17:20,791
>> KI--KIKYO.

390
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:26,458
HOW COULD--I THOUGHT--

391
00:17:26,458 --> 00:17:28,958
>> SISTER KIKYO!

392
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,291
>> KIKYO!

393
00:17:30,291 --> 00:17:34,791
>> WHO DID THIS TO YOU, KIKYO?

394
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:38,458
>> AM I GONNA DIE LIKE THIS?

395
00:17:38,458 --> 00:17:39,791
>> STOP, THAT'S ALL I NEED

396
00:17:39,791 --> 00:17:42,791
TO HEAR.

397
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,125
>> I GUESS THAT'S OK.

398
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,458
KIKYO, EVEN THOUGH IT ENDED LIKE

399
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:55,825
THIS, I STILL LOVE--

400
00:17:55,825 --> 00:17:57,325
>> THE SACRED JEWEL.

401
00:17:57,325 --> 00:18:00,758
IT WAS ALL BECAUSE OF THIS.

402
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:02,525
LISTEN TO ME, KAEDE.

403
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,791
TAKE THE SACRED JEWEL

404
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,591
AND BURN IT WITH MY BODY.

405
00:18:06,591 --> 00:18:08,558
THAT WAY IT WILL NEVER FALL INTO

406
00:18:08,558 --> 00:18:15,225
THE HANDS OF EVIL AGAIN.

407
00:18:15,225 --> 00:18:16,725
>> KIKYO!

408
00:18:16,725 --> 00:18:21,725
KIKYO!

409
00:18:21,725 --> 00:18:23,558
>> I WILL TAKE THE SACRED JEWEL

410
00:18:23,558 --> 00:18:26,856
WITH ME TO THE NETHERWORLD.

411
00:18:32,258 --> 00:18:34,091
>> IT HAS BEEN 50 YEARS SINCE

412
00:18:34,091 --> 00:18:35,625
INUYASHA WAS SEALED TO

413
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,158
THE SACRED TREE.

414
00:18:37,158 --> 00:18:38,558
HE LOOKS EXACTLY THE SAME

415
00:18:38,558 --> 00:18:40,325
AS HE DID THEN.

416
00:18:40,325 --> 00:18:42,658
50 YEARS AGO, MY SISTER KNEW

417
00:18:42,658 --> 00:18:46,558
THAT SHE WAS GOING TO DIE.

418
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,891
SO WHY DID SHE CHOOSE TO USE

419
00:18:47,891 --> 00:18:50,125
THE ARROW OF SEALING RATHER THAN

420
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,891
A SACRED ARROW TO DESTROY HIM?

421
00:18:52,891 --> 00:18:54,525
WHY DID SHE SEAL INUYASHA TO

422
00:18:54,525 --> 00:18:56,925
THE SACRED TREE--A TREE OF AGES

423
00:18:56,925 --> 00:18:58,591
SAID TO BE ABLE TO TRANSCEND

424
00:18:58,591 --> 00:18:59,725
TIME?

425
00:18:59,725 --> 00:19:01,791
AND IF INUYASHA WAS FILLED WITH

426
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,658
HATRED TOWARD MY SISTER,

427
00:19:03,658 --> 00:19:05,091
WHO TOOK BACK THE SACRED JEWEL

428
00:19:05,091 --> 00:19:06,325
AND SEALED HIM TO THE SACRED

429
00:19:06,325 --> 00:19:09,391
TREE, THEN WHY DOES HE WEAR SUCH

430
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,858
A PEACEFUL EXPRESSION?

431
00:19:12,858 --> 00:19:14,525
IT SEEMS I UNDERSTAND

432
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:17,525
VERY LITTLE AFTER ALL.

433
00:19:17,525 --> 00:19:19,025
I WONDER SOMETIMES IF

434
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:32,625
I EVER WILL.

435
00:19:32,625 --> 00:19:33,358
>> [CRYING]

436
00:19:33,358 --> 00:19:34,858
>> OH, IT'S A BABY!

437
00:19:34,858 --> 00:19:37,025
MY FIRST GRANDCHILD!

438
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,625
A BEAUTIFUL BABY GIRL!

439
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:39,791
>> IT'S OK.

440
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:41,091
GOOD GIRL.

441
00:19:41,091 --> 00:19:42,025
OH, WE'RE GOING TO CALL

442
00:19:42,025 --> 00:19:44,725
YOU KAGOME.

443
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:47,125
KAGOME.

444
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:48,025
>> [CRIES]

445
00:19:48,025 --> 00:19:49,858
>> IT'S NICE TO FINALLY SEE YOU,

446
00:19:49,858 --> 00:19:57,091
KAGOME.

447
00:19:57,091 --> 00:19:57,891
>> KAGOME?

448
00:19:57,891 --> 00:20:00,625
YOUR FRIEND'S ON THE PHONE.

449
00:20:00,625 --> 00:20:02,425
>> THE NOTES FOR PRACTICE?

450
00:20:02,425 --> 00:20:04,291
SURE, I'LL BRING THEM TODAY.

451
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:07,358
I KNOW, I KNOW.
