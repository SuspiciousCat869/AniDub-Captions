1
00:01:42,714 --> 00:01:44,714
>> I'M KAGOME HIGURASHI,

2
00:01:44,714 --> 00:01:46,147
AND I WAS BORN INTO AN OLD

3
00:01:46,147 --> 00:01:47,581
AND RESPECTED FAMILY OF

4
00:01:47,581 --> 00:01:48,881
SHRINEKEEPERS.

5
00:01:48,881 --> 00:01:49,881
I'M A NINTH-GRADE STUDENT

6
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:50,914
IN MIDDLE SCHOOL, LEADING

7
00:01:50,914 --> 00:01:52,781
A PRETTY NORMAL LIFE.

8
00:01:52,781 --> 00:01:54,347
OR SO IT WAS UNTIL MY 15th

9
00:01:54,347 --> 00:01:56,047
BIRTHDAY, WHEN I WAS DRAGGED

10
00:01:56,047 --> 00:01:58,014
INTO THE FEUDAL ERA BY A DEMON

11
00:01:58,014 --> 00:01:58,981
THAT POPPED OUT OF

12
00:01:58,981 --> 00:02:03,147
THE SHRINE WELL.

13
00:02:03,147 --> 00:02:04,147
THAT'S HOW I MET THE YOUNG

14
00:02:04,147 --> 00:02:05,847
HALF-DEMON INUYASHA.

15
00:02:05,847 --> 00:02:07,281
HE AND PRACTICALLY EVERY OTHER

16
00:02:07,281 --> 00:02:09,281
DEMON IS AFTER THE SACRED JEWEL

17
00:02:09,281 --> 00:02:11,114
OF FOUR SOULS--A TREASURE THAT

18
00:02:11,114 --> 00:02:16,314
INCREASES A DEMON'S POWER.

19
00:02:16,314 --> 00:02:17,814
I'VE BEEN GOING BACK AND FORTH

20
00:02:17,814 --> 00:02:19,414
BETWEEN MY WORLD AND THE FEUDAL

21
00:02:19,414 --> 00:02:20,747
ERA, WHERE I TRY TO HELP

22
00:02:20,747 --> 00:02:22,281
INUYASHA AND OTHER FRIENDS

23
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,347
FIND SHARDS OF THE SHATTERED

24
00:02:23,347 --> 00:02:25,381
JEWEL.

25
00:02:25,381 --> 00:02:27,214
ONE GREEDY DEMON--NARAKU--

26
00:02:27,214 --> 00:02:28,581
IS TRYING TO GET THE SACRED

27
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:30,481
JEWEL FOR HIMSELF.

28
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:32,247
SCHEMING TO ABSORB THE DEMON

29
00:02:32,247 --> 00:02:33,847
POWERS OF INUYASHA'S BROTHER

30
00:02:33,847 --> 00:02:36,147
SESSHOMARU, NARAKU LURES HIM

31
00:02:36,147 --> 00:02:37,048
TO HIS CASTLE.

32
00:02:42,414 --> 00:02:43,747
AND JUST AS NARAKU IS

33
00:02:43,747 --> 00:02:45,214
ABOUT TO COMPLETELY CONSUME

34
00:02:45,214 --> 00:02:47,181
SESSHOMARU'S BODY, INUYASHA

35
00:02:47,181 --> 00:02:48,414
BREAKS THROUGH HIS BARRIER

36
00:02:48,414 --> 00:02:50,914
AND RUSHES INTO THE CASTLE.

37
00:02:50,914 --> 00:02:52,047
>> YOU'RE DEAD!

38
00:02:52,047 --> 00:02:55,547
WIND SCAR!

39
00:02:55,547 --> 00:02:56,447
>> HE'S BROKEN THROUGH

40
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:57,547
MY BARRIER.

41
00:02:57,547 --> 00:02:59,847
>> DIE!

42
00:02:59,847 --> 00:03:03,214
>> HUH?

43
00:03:03,214 --> 00:03:04,781
>> INUYASHA IS ABOUT TO FINISH

44
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,247
NARAKU OFF FOR GOOD,

45
00:03:06,247 --> 00:03:08,214
BUT IT ISN'T MEANT TO BE.

46
00:03:08,214 --> 00:03:10,014
>> YOU FOOL!

47
00:03:10,014 --> 00:03:11,281
DON'T THINK THAT YOU CAN EVER

48
00:03:11,281 --> 00:03:13,214
ESCAPE MY GRASP.

49
00:03:13,214 --> 00:03:14,847
>> NARAKU HAD USED SANGO'S

50
00:03:14,847 --> 00:03:16,381
YOUNGER BROTHER KOHAKU

51
00:03:16,381 --> 00:03:17,547
AS A DIVERSION TO MAKE

52
00:03:17,547 --> 00:03:18,881
HIS OWN ESCAPE.

53
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:19,947
THEN HE SIMPLY VANISHED

54
00:03:19,947 --> 00:03:20,909
BEFORE OUR EYES.

55
00:03:30,581 --> 00:03:32,714
>> DAMN THAT NARAKU.

56
00:03:32,714 --> 00:03:34,347
THE CASTLE LOOKS ABANDONED,

57
00:03:34,347 --> 00:03:35,381
SO HE PROBABLY WON'T BE

58
00:03:35,381 --> 00:03:36,847
COMING BACK.

59
00:03:36,847 --> 00:03:39,614
>> I'M AFRAID YOU'RE RIGHT.

60
00:03:39,614 --> 00:03:40,514
AFTER YOU BROKE THROUGH

61
00:03:40,514 --> 00:03:41,981
HIS DEMONIC BARRIER,

62
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:43,314
NARAKU HAD TO MOVE ON

63
00:03:43,314 --> 00:03:45,047
OR ELSE RISK BEING ATTACKED.

64
00:03:45,047 --> 00:03:46,347
>> [GROWLING]

65
00:03:46,347 --> 00:03:48,214
>> HMM.

66
00:03:48,214 --> 00:03:49,314
>> MAN.

67
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:51,381
NARAKU IS PROBABLY VULNERABLE

68
00:03:51,381 --> 00:03:52,447
ENOUGH RIGHT NOW FOR ME

69
00:03:52,447 --> 00:03:54,481
TO KILL HIM, TOO.

70
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:56,514
I WAS SO CLOSE.

71
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:57,435
DAMMIT!

72
00:04:08,347 --> 00:04:09,847
>> [THINKING] I WONDER IF COMING

73
00:04:09,847 --> 00:04:14,547
HOME WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

74
00:04:14,547 --> 00:04:16,081
I FEEL BAD ABOUT LEAVING

75
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:17,847
INUYASHA AND THE OTHERS.

76
00:04:17,847 --> 00:04:20,114
HERE I AM, PERFECTLY SAFE,

77
00:04:20,114 --> 00:04:21,547
JUST PASSING THE TIME STUDYING

78
00:04:21,547 --> 00:04:22,481
WHILE THEY COULD BE

79
00:04:22,481 --> 00:04:24,214
IN REAL DANGER.

80
00:04:24,214 --> 00:04:28,681
I HOPE THEY'RE ALL OK.

81
00:04:28,681 --> 00:04:29,714
>> THIS PROBLEM WILL BE

82
00:04:29,714 --> 00:04:31,114
ON THE TEST IN TWO DAYS,

83
00:04:31,114 --> 00:04:32,081
SO MEMORIZE IT NOW

84
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:33,347
WHILE YOU HAVE THE CHANCE.

85
00:04:33,347 --> 00:04:35,781
>> UH, WHAT TEST?

86
00:04:35,781 --> 00:04:40,781
>> [INDISTINCT CHATTER]

87
00:04:40,781 --> 00:04:42,081
>> I CAN'T SIT AROUND

88
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,881
WORRYING ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE.

89
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:45,414
I'VE ONLY GOT TWO DAYS

90
00:04:45,414 --> 00:04:46,747
TO CATCH UP.

91
00:04:46,747 --> 00:04:47,847
AND IF I DON'T CRAM NOW,

92
00:04:47,847 --> 00:04:49,214
I'LL END UP FLUNKING.

93
00:04:49,214 --> 00:04:49,981
>> YOU WANT TO WALK HOME

94
00:04:49,981 --> 00:04:51,014
WITH US?

95
00:04:51,014 --> 00:04:53,381
>> SURE. YOU BET.

96
00:04:53,381 --> 00:04:55,147
SO YOU SEE THE BIND I'M IN.

97
00:04:55,147 --> 00:04:56,014
DO ME A FAVOR,

98
00:04:56,014 --> 00:04:57,814
AND LEND ME YOUR NOTES.

99
00:04:57,814 --> 00:05:01,281
>> IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.

100
00:05:01,281 --> 00:05:02,247
>> WE HAVE TO STUDY FOR

101
00:05:02,247 --> 00:05:03,514
THE TEST, TOO, YOU KNOW.

102
00:05:03,514 --> 00:05:04,581
>> OH, COME ON, YOU GUYS.

103
00:05:04,581 --> 00:05:05,581
I JUST WANT TO BORROW THEM

104
00:05:05,581 --> 00:05:06,647
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.

105
00:05:06,647 --> 00:05:07,447
I'LL GIVE THEM RIGHT BACK

106
00:05:07,447 --> 00:05:08,114
TO YOU.

107
00:05:08,114 --> 00:05:09,314
>> I KNOW HOW HARD IT MUST BE

108
00:05:09,314 --> 00:05:10,414
WITH ALL THE SCHOOL YOU MISS

109
00:05:10,414 --> 00:05:12,014
'CAUSE YOU'RE SICK ALL THE TIME.

110
00:05:12,014 --> 00:05:13,681
>> I KNEW YOU'D UNDERSTAND.

111
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:14,881
SO HELP ME OUT AND LET ME

112
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,281
MAKE A SUPER-FAST COPY

113
00:05:16,281 --> 00:05:18,114
OF YOUR NOTES, OK?

114
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:19,114
>> ALL RIGHT.

115
00:05:19,114 --> 00:05:20,414
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT

116
00:05:20,414 --> 00:05:21,614
FRIENDS ARE FOR.

117
00:05:21,614 --> 00:05:23,047
>> SO YOU WILL?

118
00:05:23,047 --> 00:05:24,214
>> JUST MAKE IT QUICK.

119
00:05:24,214 --> 00:05:26,214
>> OH! YOU'RE THE BEST!

120
00:05:26,214 --> 00:05:27,747
>> BUT IN EXCHANGE...

121
00:05:27,747 --> 00:05:30,414
>> HUH? WHAT? OH.

122
00:05:30,414 --> 00:05:32,681
>> [TOGETHER] THANKS, KAGOME.

123
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:34,347
>> AW.

124
00:05:34,347 --> 00:05:36,447
>> MMM.

125
00:05:36,447 --> 00:05:39,447
>> MMM.

126
00:05:39,447 --> 00:05:41,514
>> [SIGH]

127
00:05:41,514 --> 00:05:42,881
>> UH, KAGOME?

128
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:43,747
>> HUH?

129
00:05:43,747 --> 00:05:45,947
>> THERE YOU GO, THINKING AGAIN.

130
00:05:45,947 --> 00:05:46,847
>> ABOUT WHAT?

131
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:48,847
>> COME ON. YOU CAN'T FOOL US.

132
00:05:48,847 --> 00:05:49,947
YOUR JEALOUS BOYFRIEND;

133
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:51,047
THE ONE WITH THE ATTITUDE.

134
00:05:51,047 --> 00:05:52,514
>> OH, THAT GUY.

135
00:05:52,514 --> 00:05:54,181
I WASN'T THINKING ABOUT HIM.

136
00:05:54,181 --> 00:05:55,814
>> JUST FESS UP FOR ONCE.

137
00:05:55,814 --> 00:05:57,481
>> SO, HOW'S IT GOING?

138
00:05:57,481 --> 00:05:58,847
>> UH, I DON'T KNOW

139
00:05:58,847 --> 00:06:00,014
WHAT YOU WANT ME TO SAY.

140
00:06:00,014 --> 00:06:02,114
>> THERE MUST BE SOMETHING NEW.

141
00:06:02,114 --> 00:06:03,281
>> WELL, I MET HIS OLDER BROTHER

142
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,181
THE OTHER DAY.

143
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:05,847
>> OH, SO HE HAS A BROTHER?

144
00:06:05,847 --> 00:06:07,914
>> SO, IS HE A PUNK AS WELL?

145
00:06:07,914 --> 00:06:08,614
>> I BET HIS BROTHER'S

146
00:06:08,614 --> 00:06:09,447
JUST AS STRONG.

147
00:06:09,447 --> 00:06:10,181
>> OH, YEAH,

148
00:06:10,181 --> 00:06:11,547
HE'S STRONG, ALL RIGHT--

149
00:06:11,547 --> 00:06:12,381
MAYBE EVEN THE STRONGER

150
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:13,481
OF THE TWO.

151
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:14,381
YOU GET THE TWO OF THEM IN THE

152
00:06:14,381 --> 00:06:15,614
SAME ROOM, AND LET ME TELL YOU,

153
00:06:15,614 --> 00:06:17,547
THE FUR STARTS FLYING.

154
00:06:17,547 --> 00:06:18,781
>> [THINKING] KAGOME'S BOYFRIEND

155
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:20,581
IS DEFINITELY DANGEROUS.

156
00:06:20,581 --> 00:06:21,581
A GOOD FRIEND WOULD STEP IN

157
00:06:21,581 --> 00:06:22,714
AND SAY SOMETHING TO HER,

158
00:06:22,714 --> 00:06:23,714
WOULDN'T SHE?

159
00:06:23,714 --> 00:06:24,681
>> [THINKING] HER FUTURE'S

160
00:06:24,681 --> 00:06:27,181
ON A COLLISION COURSE WITH DOOM.

161
00:06:27,181 --> 00:06:28,047
>> [THINKING] LOVE CAN CONQUER

162
00:06:28,047 --> 00:06:29,114
ALL, KAGOME.

163
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,081
ALL YOU NEED IS TO KEEP

164
00:06:30,081 --> 00:06:34,347
BELIEVING.

165
00:06:34,347 --> 00:06:35,714
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

166
00:06:35,714 --> 00:06:37,547
>> [TOGETHER] NOTHING.

167
00:06:37,547 --> 00:06:38,314
>> WHAT DO YOU SAY?

168
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:42,814
CAN I COPY YOUR NOTES NOW?

169
00:06:42,814 --> 00:06:44,547
>> [TOGETHER] HUH?!

170
00:06:44,547 --> 00:06:45,714
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

171
00:06:45,714 --> 00:06:47,881
>> THE COLLEGES ARE IN EXAMS.

172
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:48,714
