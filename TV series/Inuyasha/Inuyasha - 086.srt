347
00:14:59,214 --> 00:15:02,581
SURRENDER, AND GET IT OVER WITH!

HERSELF.

00:15:13,648 --> 00:15:14,648
>> YOU'RE LATE.

356
00:15:14,648 --> 00:15:15,481
>> HUH?

357
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:16,881
>> A SECOND LATER, AND SHE WOULD

358
00:15:16,881 --> 00:15:18,114
HAVE BEEN DEMON FOOD!

359
00:15:18,114 --> 00:15:19,148
>> SHUT UP!

360
00:15:19,148 --> 00:15:20,348
YOU SHOULD BE THANKING ME

361
00:15:20,348 --> 00:15:21,881
FOR EVEN SHOWING UP.

362
00:15:21,881 --> 00:15:22,948
>> WHAT DID YOU SAY?

363
00:15:22,948 --> 00:15:24,848

00:15:28,814 --> 00:15:30,214
OH!

00:15:30,214 --> 00:15:32,514
HOW DARE YOU?

367
00:15:32,514 --> 00:15:34,081
YOU FIEND!

368
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:36,348
MY BEAUTIFUL FACE IS SCARRED!

00:15:36,348 --> 00:15:37,881
YOU'VE RUINED ME!

370

AROUND HERE.

376
00:15:50,748 --> 00:15:52,914
TIME TO PUT AN END TO THIS.

>> THE DEMON!

381
00:16:04,748 --> 00:16:08,248
>> IS IT UNCONSCIOUS?

384
00:16:15,814 --> 00:16:17,614
>> LOOK. MY LORD!

385
00:16:17,614 --> 00:16:22,048
>> WHAT IS IT?

386
00:16:22,048 --> 00:16:25,285
>> [ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

>> DIE!

389
00:16:38,081 --> 00:16:39,648
HUH?

390
00:16:39,648 --> 00:16:41,248
STAY STILL, WOULD YOU?

391
00:16:41,248 --> 00:16:43,114
>> HA HA HA HA!

392
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:44,814
>> WHAT'S SO FUNNY?

393
00:16:44,814 --> 00:16:46,514
>> THE OCCUPANTS OF THIS CASTLE

394
00:16:46,514 --> 00:16:48,748
BURIED MY HEAD UNDERGROUND.

395
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:49,648
THEY HOPED THAT IT WOULD

396
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:51,214
WARD OFF EVIL.

397
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:53,881
THOSE FOOLISH HUMANS!

398
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:56,448
THAT'S WHY I CURSED THE PRINCESS

399
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:58,081
TO DEATH, THEN ASSUMED

400
00:16:58,081 --> 00:16:59,314
HER APPEARANCE.

401
00:16:59,314 --> 00:17:01,548
AND INTO HER CORPSE, I HID THE

402
00:17:01,548 --> 00:17:03,781
SPIRITUAL POWERS THAT I STOLE

403
00:17:03,781 --> 00:17:07,148
FROM THOSE I DEVOURED.

404
00:17:07,148 --> 00:17:08,481
>> SO THE LORD WAS MERELY

405
00:17:08,481 --> 00:17:11,814
GUARDING THE PRINCESS' BODY

406
00:17:11,814 --> 00:17:14,211
AND ACTING AS A DECOY IN CASE

407
00:17:14,211 --> 00:17:15,929
THE TRUTH WERE EVER LEARNED.

408
00:17:22,711 --> 00:17:23,744
HUH.

409
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:25,544
WELL, THAT'S TOO BAD FOR YOU,

410
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:26,544
DEMON HEAD.

411
00:17:26,544 --> 00:17:27,777
YOU'RE MESSING WITH THE WRONG

412
00:17:27,777 --> 00:17:28,911
PEOPLE THIS TIME.

413
00:17:28,911 --> 00:17:30,811
>> HA HA HA HA!

414
00:17:30,811 --> 00:17:31,844
DO YOU THINK SO?

415
00:17:31,844 --> 00:17:33,044
>> I KNOW SO!

416
00:17:33,044 --> 00:17:34,044
>> WAIT. STOP!

417
00:17:34,044 --> 00:17:34,811
>> HMM?

418
00:17:34,811 --> 00:17:35,911
>> MIROKU!

419
00:17:35,911 --> 00:17:37,877
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT, MIROKU?

420
00:17:37,877 --> 00:17:39,377
QUIT INTERFERING!

421
00:17:39,377 --> 00:17:40,677
>> I HAVE TO ASK THE DEMON

422
00:17:40,677 --> 00:17:42,611
SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S DESTROYED.

423
00:17:42,611 --> 00:17:43,944
>> LIKE WHAT?

424
00:17:43,944 --> 00:17:45,311
>> MONK?

425
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:47,111
>> TELL ME, WHY DIDN'T YOU MAKE

426
00:17:47,111 --> 00:17:48,744
YOUR ESCAPE SOONER?

427
00:17:48,744 --> 00:17:51,277
YOU HAD EASILY OVERPOWERED ME.

428
00:17:51,277 --> 00:17:53,111
WITH SUCH AN OBVIOUSLY POWERFUL

429
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,244
DEMONIC AURA, YOU COULD HAVE

430
00:17:54,244 --> 00:17:56,177
ESCAPED ANYTIME YOU WANTED.

431
00:17:56,177 --> 00:17:57,677
>> HA HA HA HA!

432
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,244
UNTIL NOW, I HAD TO BE CAREFUL

433
00:18:00,244 --> 00:18:01,711
ABOUT APPEARING.

434
00:18:01,711 --> 00:18:03,311
I KNEW THAT THERE WAS A STRONGER

435
00:18:03,311 --> 00:18:05,377
PRESENCE--ONE THAT COULD TAKE

436
00:18:05,377 --> 00:18:07,577
COMPLETE CONTROL OF ME.

437
00:18:07,577 --> 00:18:09,044
>> [TOGETHER] HUH?

438
00:18:09,044 --> 00:18:11,477
>> HUH?

439
00:18:11,477 --> 00:18:13,611
A STRONGER PRESENCE?

440
00:18:13,611 --> 00:18:14,844
>> CORRECT.

441
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:17,111
NARAKU AND THE DEMONIC AURA

442
00:18:17,111 --> 00:18:18,544
HE CONTROLLED.

443
00:18:18,544 --> 00:18:20,944
HOWEVER, NARAKU IS NO LONGER

444
00:18:20,944 --> 00:18:23,277
AROUND, AND I DON'T HAVE TO

445
00:18:23,277 --> 00:18:24,644
HIDE MYSELF IN THIS CASTLE

446
00:18:24,644 --> 00:18:28,444
ANY LONGER!

447
00:18:28,444 --> 00:18:30,111
>> IT'S ESCAPING!

448
00:18:30,111 --> 00:18:31,577
>> HA HA HA HA!

449
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,311
NOW I CAN HAVE MY FILL OF MONKS

450
00:18:34,311 --> 00:18:36,511
AND PRIESTESSES!

451
00:18:36,511 --> 00:18:38,611
>> NOT HAPPENING, UGLY.

452
00:18:38,611 --> 00:18:40,368
WIND SCAR!

453
00:18:44,644 --> 00:18:48,811
>> HUH?

454
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:52,177
[SCREAMING]

455
00:18:52,177 --> 00:18:53,655

>> [GRUNTS]

457
00:19:04,111 --> 00:19:05,377
>> IT'S STILL ALIVE.

458
00:19:05,377 --> 00:19:07,511
>> THE WIND SCAR DIDN'T WORK.

459
00:19:07,511 --> 00:19:09,344
>> HA HA HA HA!

460
00:19:09,344 --> 00:19:11,044
IT'S JUST A START.

461
00:19:11,044 --> 00:19:13,044
I'LL RESTORE MY BODY

462
00:19:13,044 --> 00:19:17,477
AND WREAK HAVOC ON THIS LAND!

463
00:19:17,477 --> 00:19:18,677
WHAT?!

464
00:19:18,677 --> 00:19:20,277
>> WIND TUNNEL!

465
00:19:20,277 --> 00:19:22,915
>> [SCREAMING]

IT'S ALL OVER, FINALLY.

468
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:35,977
>> ABOUT TIME.

469
00:19:35,977 --> 00:19:38,134
WHAT A PAIN THAT WAS.

470
00:19:48,411 --> 00:19:49,644
>> LOOK!

471
00:19:49,644 --> 00:19:50,877
>> THE SKY IS RETURNING

472
00:19:50,877 --> 00:19:52,844
TO NORMAL.

473
00:19:52,844 --> 00:19:54,444
>> THE DEMON'S DESTROYED,

474
00:19:54,444 --> 00:19:55,544
AND THE DEMONIC AURA OVER

475
00:19:55,544 --> 00:19:57,642
THE CASTLE HAS DISAPPEARED.

476
00:20:30,211 --> 00:20:31,811
>> SO IT'S ALL BECAUSE THIS

477
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:34,511
DEMON NAMED NARAKU HAS VANISHED?

478
00:20:34,511 --> 00:20:35,977
AND THAT'S WHY THE DEMONS

479
00:20:35,977 --> 00:20:37,511
IN THIS REGION ARE ACTING UP

480
00:20:37,511 --> 00:20:39,144
SO MUCH?

481
00:20:39,144 --> 00:20:40,944
>> IT SEEMS SO.

482
00:20:40,944 --> 00:20:41,944
>> AH.

483
00:20:41,944 --> 00:20:43,011
THEN I CAN SEE THAT I'LL BE

484
00:20:43,011 --> 00:20:44,411
GETTING VERY BUSY.

485
00:20:44,411 --> 00:20:46,744
BUSINESS WILL SOON BE BOOMING.

486
00:20:46,744 --> 00:20:48,011
>> HUH?

487
00:20:48,011 --> 00:20:50,011
>> OLD WOMAN, I HAVE ONE PIECE

488
00:20:50,011 --> 00:20:51,077
OF ADVICE FOR YOU.

489
00:20:51,077 --> 00:20:51,944
RETIRE.

490
00:20:51,944 --> 00:20:53,011
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A FAKE

491
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:54,411
EXORCIST ANYWAY.

492
00:20:54,411 --> 00:20:56,877
>> INUYASHA, DON'T BE SO BLUNT.

493
00:20:56,877 --> 00:20:58,011
>> SHUT YOUR MOUTH.

494
00:20:58,011 --> 00:20:59,044
IF IT WEREN'T FOR ME

495
00:20:59,044 --> 00:21:00,577
AND MY PURIFICATION SALT,

496
00:21:00,577 --> 00:21:01,477
THE MONK WOULD BE NOTHING

497
00:21:01,477 --> 00:21:02,477
BUT A MEMORY NOW.

498
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:04,144
>> AND I'M GRATEFUL TO YOU.

499
00:21:04,144 --> 00:21:06,377
>> HUH. WOULD YOU LISTEN TO HER?

500
00:21:06,377 --> 00:21:07,744
>> I THINK THIS EXPERIENCE

501
00:21:07,744 --> 00:21:09,377
HAS MADE HER OVERCONFIDENT.

502
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:10,844
>> AND UNFORTUNATELY FOR US,

503
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:12,111
SHE'LL PROBABLY LIVE

504
00:21:12,111 --> 00:21:13,577
A LONG LIFE.

505
00:21:13,577 --> 00:21:14,877
>> YEAH, MEANING SHE WON'T BE

506
00:21:14,877 --> 00:21:16,611
EASY TO GET RID OF.

507
00:21:16,611 --> 00:21:19,311
>> HUH? DID YOU SAY SOMETHING?

508
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,611
>> [TOGETHER] UH, NOPE.

509
00:21:20,611 --> 00:21:21,811
>> HEY, COME ON.

510
00:21:21,811 --> 00:21:22,944
LET'S GET GOING.

511
00:21:22,944 --> 00:21:25,077
>> GOOD IDEA.

512
00:21:25,077 --> 00:21:26,577
>> IF ANYTHING COMES UP,

513
00:21:26,577 --> 00:21:27,477
I'D BE HAPPY TO HELP

514
00:21:27,477 --> 00:21:28,877
YOU YOUNGSTERS.

515
00:21:28,877 --> 00:21:29,544
>> THANKS.

516
00:21:29,544 --> 00:21:31,477
WE MIGHT TAKE YOU UP ON THAT.

517
00:21:31,477 --> 00:21:34,735
>> TAKE CARE! THANKS AGAIN!

518
00:21:39,077 --> 00:21:40,844
>> WELL, PEOPLE, THIS IS

519
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:42,711
BECOMING A REAL PROBLEM.

520
00:21:42,711 --> 00:21:44,711
WITH NARAKU'S DISAPPEARANCE,

521
00:21:44,711 --> 00:21:45,877
EVEN THE DEMONS WHO WERE IN

522
00:21:45,877 --> 00:21:47,244
HIDING ARE STARTING TO LOOK FOR

523
00:21:47,244 --> 00:21:48,244
THE JEWEL SHARDS.

524
00:21:48,244 --> 00:21:49,444
>> HUH.

525
00:21:49,444 --> 00:21:50,844
THEY'RE NOTHING BUT A BUNCH

526
00:21:50,844 --> 00:21:52,577
OF PUNY DEMONS WHO WERE SCARED

527
00:21:52,577 --> 00:21:53,844
OF NARAKU.

528
00:21:53,844 --> 00:21:55,111
I COULD TAKE CARE OF EVERY

529
00:21:55,111 --> 00:22:00,477
SINGLE ONE OF THEM.

530
00:22:00,477 --> 00:22:02,311
[THINKING] BESIDES, IT'S NOT

531
00:22:02,311 --> 00:22:03,544
LIKE NARAKU HAS COMPLETELY

532
00:22:03,544 --> 00:22:04,577
VANISHED OFF THE FACE

533
00:22:04,577 --> 00:22:05,611
OF THE EARTH.

534
00:22:05,611 --> 00:22:08,048
I WILL DEFINITELY FIND HIM.

535
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:28,434
>> [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

536
00:24:00,075 --> 00:24:01,242
>> WHY AM I LIVING

537
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:02,842
IN THIS WORLD?

538
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,375
JUST WHAT AM I?

539
00:24:04,375 --> 00:24:06,442
AND WHERE AM I GOING?

540
00:24:06,442 --> 00:24:07,975
WHAT WAS IT THAT CAUSED MY FATE

541
00:24:07,975 --> 00:24:10,542
TO GO AWRY?

542
00:24:10,542 --> 00:24:12,975
THAT TIME THAT I SPENT WITH

543
00:24:12,975 --> 00:24:18,842
INUYASHA, WHEN I SAVED ONIGUMO.

544
00:24:18,842 --> 00:24:20,342
NEXT TIME,

545
00:24:20,342 --> 00:24:24,342
"KIKYO'S LONELY JOURNEY."

546
00:24:24,342 --> 00:24:26,342
IS THAT MOUNT HAKUREI-SAN?
