1
00:01:46,227 --> 00:01:48,310

2
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:50,610

YOU CAN RUN AND JUMP,

3
00:01:50,644 --> 00:01:53,910
BUT YOU CAN NEVER
ESCAPE MY WIND.

4
00:01:53,944 --> 00:01:56,977
THUNDER BLADES!

5
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,277
- UH!

6
00:02:00,644 --> 00:02:04,877
MY SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

7
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:12,110
- NOW IS THE TIME
TO ESCAPE,

8
00:02:12,144 --> 00:02:15,477
WHEN NARAKU'S BARRIER
IS WEAK.

9
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:18,210
IT'S NO USE.

10
00:02:22,244 --> 00:02:24,577
YES.

11
00:02:25,444 --> 00:02:28,610
HE CAN HELP ME.

12
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:31,444
HE HAS THE POWER

13
00:02:31,477 --> 00:02:35,444
TO SEVER THE BOND
BETWEEN NARAKU AND I.

14
00:02:35,477 --> 00:02:38,577
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

15
00:02:39,277 --> 00:02:41,744
- YO.
- YO, YOURSELF.

16
00:02:41,777 --> 00:02:45,044
- WIND SORCERESS KAGRA,
I RECALL.

17
00:02:45,077 --> 00:02:50,177
- SO, YOU REMEMBER ME.
I AM VERY FLATTERED.

18
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:53,010
TAKE YOUR HAND
FROM YOUR SWORD.

19
00:02:53,044 --> 00:02:55,810
I DIDN'T COME TO FIGHT,
SESSHOUMARU.

20
00:02:55,844 --> 00:02:59,544
I HAVE A PROPOSITION
YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN.

21
00:02:59,577 --> 00:03:01,044
- PROPOSITION?

22
00:03:01,077 --> 00:03:04,110
- YOU KNOW WHAT THESE ARE,
SESSHOUMARU.

23
00:03:04,144 --> 00:03:08,510
I'LL GIVE YOU
THESE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

24
00:03:08,544 --> 00:03:12,977
IN RETURN, I WANT YOU
TO KILL NARAKU.

25
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:13,910
- WHAT?

26
00:03:13,944 --> 00:03:18,910
- FREE ME.
RELEASE ME FROM HIS GRASP.

27
00:03:27,344 --> 00:03:29,744
YOU HAVE THE POWER
TO DO IT.

28
00:03:29,777 --> 00:03:31,310
ONCE YOU KILL NARAKU,

29
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:34,577
ALL THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS
HE HAS GATHERED

30
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:36,977
WILL BE YOURS.

31
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:39,377
LET'S USE THOSE SHARDS
AND PROVIDE OURSELVES

32
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,644
WITH A LITTLE AMUSEMENT.

33
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,544
- YOU INTEND
TO BETRAY NARAKU?

34
00:03:43,577 --> 00:03:46,744
- IT'S NOT AS THOUGH
I HAVE CHOSEN

35
00:03:46,777 --> 00:03:48,544
TO LIVE UNDER HIS COMMAND.

36
00:03:48,577 --> 00:03:50,344
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF MY PLAN?

37
00:03:50,377 --> 00:03:52,877
JOINING FORCES WOULD BE
OF MUTUAL BENEFIT.

38
00:03:52,910 --> 00:03:58,577
- UNFORTUNATELY, I HAVE
NO INTEREST IN THE SACRED JEWEL.

39
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:01,277
IF YOU WISH
TO BECOME FREE,

40
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:05,210
USE THOSE SHARDS YOURSELF
AND DESTROY NARAKU.

41
00:04:05,244 --> 00:04:09,144
- HMM! ARE YOU
AFRAID OF HIM?

42
00:04:09,177 --> 00:04:13,677
- I'M SAYING I'M UNDER
NO OBLIGATION TO ASSIST YOU.

43
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:14,944
- UH!

44
00:04:14,977 --> 00:04:17,710
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOLVE
TO GO IT ALONE,

45
00:04:17,744 --> 00:04:19,710
DON'T EVEN THINK
ABOUT BETRAYING HIM.

46
00:04:19,744 --> 00:04:24,377
- FOOLISH COWARD!
AND YOU CALL YOURSELF A MAN?

47
00:04:24,410 --> 00:04:25,177
- AH!

48
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:28,910
- I MISJUDGED YOU.

49
00:04:29,444 --> 00:04:31,377
- AH!

50
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:35,444
- PATHETIC FOOL.

51
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:36,544
- HA!

52
00:04:36,577 --> 00:04:38,310
THAT DESPICABLE WOMAN.

53
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:41,277
YOU KNOW, I WONDER
IF SHE TRULY INTENDED

54
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,344
TO MAKE YOU HER PROTECTOR.
TALK ABOUT GALL.

55
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:46,910
WHERE ON EARTH
DOES SHE GET THE NERVE?

56
00:04:46,944 --> 00:04:49,844
AN INCARNATION,
THAT'S ALL SHE IS.

57
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:52,144
- YOU'RE SO STRONG,
LORD SESSHOUMARU.

58
00:04:52,177 --> 00:04:55,910
YOU DON'T EVEN NEED
THE POWER OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

59
00:04:55,944 --> 00:04:57,810
- WIND SORCERESS KAGRA.

60
00:04:57,844 --> 00:05:00,477
I WONDER IF SHE CAN USE
THE SACRED JEWEL

61
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:02,844
AND DEFEAT NARAKU
BY HERSELF.

62
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:07,844
EITHER WAY,
IT DOESN'T CONCERN ME.

63
00:05:07,877 --> 00:05:09,910
- HMM?

64
00:05:09,944 --> 00:05:12,577
MILORD, WHERE
ARE YOU OFF TO?

65
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:15,377
ARE YOU LEAVING ALREADY?

66
00:05:15,777 --> 00:05:19,577
AAH! OH, I FORGOT SOMETHING.
COME ALONG.

67
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:23,910
- LORD SESSHOUMARU,
I'M NOT LONELY ANYMORE,

68
00:05:23,944 --> 00:05:27,710
BUT I WONDER
IF MAYBE KAGRA IS.

69
00:05:37,277 --> 00:05:43,044
- MILORD, WHAT SHALL WE DO
ABOUT DINNER?

70
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:52,610
- OOPS. DID I WIND IT
TOO TIGHT?

71
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:54,510
- NO. THANKS, KAGOME.

72
00:05:54,544 --> 00:05:58,710
YOUR REMEDIES HAVE TAKEN AWAY
NEARLY ALL OF THE PAIN.

73
00:05:58,744 --> 00:06:02,244
- LEAVE THAT HALF-DEAD WOLF
ALONE, KAGOME.

74
00:06:02,277 --> 00:06:03,277
- WHAT?

75
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:05,544
- IF IT DOESN'T HURT ANYMORE,
THEN RUN ON HOME...

76
00:06:05,577 --> 00:06:07,710
YOU PUNY LITTLE WOLF.

STANDING THERE ALL WEAK
AND MORTAL, INUYASHA.

YOU'RE IN NO POSITION
TO CRITICIZE THE SHAPE I'M IN.

80
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:19,310
- I'M NOT LIKE THIS
BY CHOICE, IDIOT.

81

- YOU WANT TO FIGHT?

WE SHOULD TAKE BACK
THE JEWEL SHARDS?

- WHY DO YOU HAVE TO
COME ALONG ANYWAY?

87
00:06:35,277 --> 00:06:37,410
- SHUT UP.
THOSE SHARDS BELONG TO ME,

88
00:06:37,444 --> 00:06:39,844
AND I AIN'T GONNA
LET YOU HAVE THEM.

89
00:06:39,877 --> 00:06:43,377
- SO, KAGRA HASN'T RETURNED
TO THE CASTLE YET?

90
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:45,244
- HMM. DOESN'T
LOOK LIKE IT.

91
00:06:45,277 --> 00:06:47,910
I FEEL LIKE
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS

92
00:06:47,944 --> 00:06:52,377
ARE MOVING FURTHER AND FURTHER
AWAY FROM NARAKU'S CASTLE.

93
00:06:52,410 --> 00:06:53,477
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

94
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:56,110
KAGRA WAS CREATED
FROM NARAKU'S BODY.

95
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:59,577
ISN'T SHE ACTING
ACCORDING TO NARAKU'S WILL?

96
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,577
- DOES THAT MEAN KAGRA IS
STEALING THE SHARDS ON HER OWN?

97
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:04,710
- IT'S POSSIBLE.

98
00:07:04,744 --> 00:07:07,544
- DON'T YOU THINK THIS WHOLE
THING IS STRANGE, INUYASHA?

99
00:07:07,577 --> 00:07:09,510
EVEN THE BARRIER.

YOU AND KOGA

101
00:07:11,644 --> 00:07:14,810
ABLE TO PICK UP
THE SCENT OF THE CASTLE?

102
00:07:14,844 --> 00:07:16,477
- THE BARRIER
HAS WEAKENED.

103
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:20,744
IT MUST BE BECAUSE
NARAKU'S OWN POWERS ARE WEAK.

104
00:07:22,744 --> 00:07:24,910
- POWERS ARE WEAK...

105
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:26,244
JUST LIKE MINE.

106
00:07:26,277 --> 00:07:29,110
- RIGHT. NARAKU
IS A HALF-DEMON AS WELL.

107
00:07:29,144 --> 00:07:31,544
- HE IS THE BODY
OF A HUMAN NAMED ONIGUMO

108
00:07:31,577 --> 00:07:33,944
AND GATHERED THE POWERS
OF COUNTLESS DEMONS.

109
00:07:33,977 --> 00:07:36,977
- SO HE'S A HALF-DEMON,
JUST LIKE INUYASHA.

110
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,477
- INUYASHA LOSES HIS POWERS
ON THE NIGHT OF THE NEW MOON.

111
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:44,744
SO MAYBE NARAKU HAS A TIME
WHEN HIS POWERS WANE.

112
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:49,244
- MEANING HE HAS
A WEAKNESS, TOO.

113

IT'S USELESS TO FLEE.

- YOU CAN ALWAYS COUNT
ON US, INUYASHA.

315
00:21:57,742 --> 00:21:59,742
- KNOCK IT OFF,
WOULD YOU!

316
00:21:59,775 --> 00:22:01,675
I DON'T NEED
ANYONE'S HELP!

317
00:22:01,709 --> 00:22:05,175
- HE'S ALWAYS FIGHTING, BUT
AT LEAST HE TRUSTS ALL OF US.

318
00:22:05,209 --> 00:22:08,409
THAT'S WHY HE DIDN'T LOSE HOPE
ON THE NIGHT OF THE NEW MOON.

319
00:22:08,442 --> 00:22:10,875
MAYBE THAT'S THE SECRET
TO HIS STRENGTH.

320
00:22:10,909 --> 00:22:14,409
- WOULD YOU PEOPLE STOP
GETTING UNDER MY SKIN?

321
00:22:14,442 --> 00:22:17,675
NO, I'M SERIOUS!
THAT'S THE LAST WARNING!

322
00:23:59,184 --> 00:24:02,384
- I AM SHIPPO,
THE FOX-DEMON OF JUSTICE,

323
00:24:02,417 --> 00:24:05,817
AND I RECEIVE
A WRITTEN CHALLENGE

324
00:24:05,851 --> 00:24:08,551
FROM THE SURVIVORS
OF THE THUNDER-DEMON TRIBE.

325
00:24:08,584 --> 00:24:14,051
OOH, THEY'RE PRETTY GUTSY,
THINKING THEY CAN COME AFTER ME.

326
00:24:17,784 --> 00:24:23,384
NEXT TIME, SHIPPO GETS
AN ANGRY CHALLENGE.

327
00:24:23,417 --> 00:24:24,417
I HAVE TO
KEEP IT TOGETHER.
