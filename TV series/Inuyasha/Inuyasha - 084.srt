00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:17,188
OFF YOU.

175
00:07:17,188 --> 00:07:18,555
>> WHY DON'T YOU GET AWAY?

176
00:07:18,555 --> 00:07:20,121
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

177
00:07:20,121 --> 00:07:21,888
>> KOGA'S DOING THIS FOR YOU.

178
00:07:21,888 --> 00:07:23,755
HE'S DOING IT TO PROTECT YOU.

179
00:07:23,755 --> 00:07:25,821
>> DON'T SELL KOGA SHORT, AYUMI.

180
00:07:25,821 --> 00:07:26,721
HE'S FIGHTING TO PROTECT

181
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:30,788
BOTH OF US.

182
00:07:30,788 --> 00:07:33,688
>> AAH!

183
00:07:33,688 --> 00:07:36,655

00:07:36,655 --> 00:07:39,121
>> INUYASHA!

185
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:41,121
>> ARE YOU ALL RIGHT, KAGOME?

186
00:07:41,121 --> 00:07:42,388
>> YEAH, WE'RE ALL FINE HERE,

187
00:07:42,388 --> 00:07:43,355
THANKS.

188
00:07:43,355 --> 00:07:44,755
>> INUYASHA?

189
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:45,755
HE MUST BE ONE OF

190
00:07:45,755 --> 00:07:47,755
KAGOME'S FRIENDS.

191
00:07:47,755 --> 00:07:48,588
>> KOGA, WHAT DO YOU THINK

192
00:07:48,588 --> 00:07:49,688
YOU'RE DOING?

193
00:07:49,688 --> 00:07:50,821
HOW COULD YOU PUT KAGOME IN

194
00:07:50,821 --> 00:07:52,321
DANGER LIKE THIS?

195
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:54,355
>> YEAH, LOOK WHO'S TALKING.

196
00:07:54,355 --> 00:07:55,655
THIS IS ALL YOUR FAULT FOR

197
00:07:55,655 --> 00:07:57,788
LETTING THE DEMON ESCAPE.

198
00:07:57,788 --> 00:07:59,421
>> I'LL PROTECT KAGOME, SO YOU

199
00:07:59,421 --> 00:08:01,721
CAN STAY OUT OF THIS, WOLF CUB.

200
00:08:01,721 --> 00:08:02,421
>> I'M THE ONE WHO'S GONNA

201
00:08:02,421 --> 00:08:03,421
PROTECT HER.

202
00:08:03,421 --> 00:08:04,388
>> YOU'RE DOING A LOUSY JOB

203
00:08:04,388 --> 00:08:05,421
SO FAR.

204
00:08:05,421 --> 00:08:06,788
>> GRR.

206
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,221
SO DON'T GO OVERBOARD

207
00:08:09,221 --> 00:08:10,421
ON MY ACCOUNT.

DON'T GET TANGLED UP IN THAT

214
00:08:20,321 --> 00:08:23,288
DEMON'S HAIR.

>> HUH, DON'T WORRY, KAGOME.

216
00:08:25,121 --> 00:08:26,388
JUST WATCH ME.

217
00:08:26,388 --> 00:08:27,521
I'LL GET HIM WITH ONE STRIKE

218
00:08:27,521 --> 00:08:29,121
OF MY WINDSCAR.

219
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,288
>> DAMN MUTT.

TRUST YOU TO COME INTO THE

221
00:08:31,155 --> 00:08:31,988
PICTURE, TRYING TO GET

222
00:08:31,988 --> 00:08:32,955
ALL THE GLORY.

223
00:08:32,955 --> 00:08:35,688
I'M GONNA GET THE DEMON!

224
00:08:35,688 --> 00:08:36,388
>> COULD THIS BE

225
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:40,855
AN UNREQUITED LOVE?

226
00:08:40,855 --> 00:08:42,488
AAH!

227
00:08:42,488 --> 00:08:43,621

SWORD AND ALL.

231
00:08:47,855 --> 00:08:49,021
>> HURRY, INUYASHA,

232
00:08:49,021 --> 00:08:50,621
YOU HAVE TO SAVE HIM.

233
00:08:50,621 --> 00:08:51,788
>> I DO?

234
00:08:51,788 --> 00:08:52,588
>> YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE

235
00:08:52,588 --> 00:08:53,755
WHO CAN DO IT.

00:08:53,755 --> 00:08:55,788
HURRY BEFORE HE'S EATEN ALIVE!

237
00:08:55,788 --> 00:08:57,488

00:08:59,488 --> 00:09:01,155
WHAT HAPPENS TO KOGA.

240
00:09:01,155 --> 00:09:02,221
>> UH!

241
00:09:02,221 --> 00:09:03,421
UH!

242
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,988
>> BUT I CAN'T LET YOU HAVE THE

243
00:09:04,988 --> 00:09:08,355
SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

244
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,455
AH!

245
00:09:09,455 --> 00:09:11,688
MAN, I GOT NOTHING BUT HAIR!

246
00:09:11,688 --> 00:09:13,255
WHAT?

247
00:09:13,255 --> 00:09:16,755
>> INUYASHA!

248
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:19,221
>> NO ONE WILL STOP ME NOW.

249
00:09:19,221 --> 00:09:20,355
I'VE FINALLY BEEN FREED FROM THE

250
00:09:20,355 --> 00:09:21,288
NARAKU.

251
00:09:21,288 --> 00:09:22,455
>> DAMN YOU!

252
00:09:22,455 --> 00:09:26,288
HUH? WHAT?

253
00:09:26,288 --> 00:09:28,055
>> I'LL USE THE SACRED JEWEL

254
00:09:28,055 --> 00:09:30,988
POWER AND RETURN TO MY FORMER

255
00:09:30,988 --> 00:09:32,121
SELF.

256
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:33,321
>> WHAT?

257
00:09:33,321 --> 00:09:34,388
>> KAGOME!

258
00:09:34,388 --> 00:09:35,255
>> KAGOME!

>> WHO'S THE GIRL OVER THERE?

262
00:09:40,488 --> 00:09:41,988
>> HER NAME IS AYUMI,

263
00:09:41,988 --> 00:09:44,021
APPARENTLY KOGA'S FIANCEE.

264
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:44,788
>> HUH?

265
00:09:44,788 --> 00:09:46,321
FIANCEE?

266
00:09:46,321 --> 00:09:47,855
>> WE CAN TALK LATER.

267
00:09:47,855 --> 00:09:49,888
>> WHAT'S THE DEMON'S STORY?

268
00:09:49,888 --> 00:09:51,155
WHERE DID IT COME FROM?

269
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:51,988
>> HE JUST SAID THAT HE'D BEEN

270
00:09:51,988 --> 00:09:53,688
FREED FROM NARAKU.

271
00:09:53,688 --> 00:09:55,355
>> HUH?

272
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,688
TELL US WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT!

273
00:09:57,688 --> 00:10:00,588
>> THAT NARAKU, HE ABANDONED THE

274
00:10:00,588 --> 00:10:03,721
CASTLE AND ME ALONG WITH IT.

275
00:10:03,721 --> 00:10:04,955
>> MEANING IT WASN'T ANOTHER ONE

276
00:10:04,955 --> 00:10:06,788
OF NARAKU'S INCARNATIONS.

277
00:10:06,788 --> 00:10:07,821
>> JUST SOMEONE HE DIDN'T NEED

278
00:10:07,821 --> 00:10:09,088
ANYMORE?

279
00:10:09,088 --> 00:10:10,288
>> YEAH, I CAN SEE HIM

280
00:10:10,288 --> 00:10:11,655
GETTING LEFT BEHIND.

281
00:10:11,655 --> 00:10:12,588
>> HUH.

282
00:10:12,588 --> 00:10:13,755
I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN.

283
00:10:13,755 --> 00:10:15,021
YOU'RE TOO UGLY EVEN FOR ONE OF

284
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:16,721
NARAKU'S DEMONS.

285
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,955
ARGH!

286
00:10:18,955 --> 00:10:21,555
WHAT WERE YOU THINKING, KOGA,

287
00:10:21,555 --> 00:10:24,076
WASTING YOUR TIME SCRAPPING WITH

288
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:26,476
TRASH LIKE THIS BIG HAIRBALL?

289
00:10:26,476 --> 00:10:28,897
>> YEAH, WELL...

290
00:10:28,897 --> 00:10:29,797
>> UH...

291
00:10:29,797 --> 00:10:32,198
UH...

292
00:10:35,964 --> 00:10:37,966
UH!

293
00:10:37,966 --> 00:10:39,847
>> I GUESS I'LL HAVE TO PROTECT

294
00:10:39,847 --> 00:10:41,681
YOU AS WELL, AYUMI.

295
00:10:41,681 --> 00:10:42,914
NOW STAY THERE, OUT OF THE WAY.

296
00:10:42,914 --> 00:10:45,047
YOU MUTT.

297
00:10:45,047 --> 00:10:45,881
I'LL COME BACK AND DEAL

298
00:10:45,881 --> 00:10:47,214
WITH YOU LATER.

299
00:10:47,214 --> 00:10:48,581
>> OH, REALLY?

300
00:10:48,581 --> 00:10:50,281
>> YEAH.

301
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,714
HEY, DEMON, SORRY TO HEAR YOUR

302
00:10:52,714 --> 00:10:54,981
SOB STORY ABOUT BEING ABANDONED.

303
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:57,247
DOES THAT MEAN YOU DON'T KNOW

304
00:10:57,247 --> 00:10:58,714
WHERE NARAKU IS?

305
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:04,081
>> ARGH!

306
00:11:04,081 --> 00:11:07,214
>> AAH!

307
00:11:07,214 --> 00:11:09,647
>> DON'T BE SO HASTY, KOGA.

308
00:11:09,647 --> 00:11:10,681
WE STILL HAVE QUESTIONS

309
00:11:10,681 --> 00:11:12,114
TO ASK IT.

310
00:11:12,114 --> 00:11:14,814
>> DON'T WORRY, YOU'LL GET YOUR

311
00:11:14,814 --> 00:11:16,614
OPPORTUNITY.

312
00:11:16,614 --> 00:11:19,281
ALL RIGHT, DEMON, TELL US

313
00:11:19,281 --> 00:11:21,214
EVERYTHING YOU KNOW,

314
00:11:21,214 --> 00:11:24,414
OR YOU'LL BE SORRY.

315
00:11:24,414 --> 00:11:25,514
>> IT'S USELESS TO

316
00:11:25,514 --> 00:11:27,047
SEARCH FOR HIM.

317
00:11:27,047 --> 00:11:29,381
NARAKU HAS ESCAPED TO A PLACE

318
00:11:29,381 --> 00:11:32,114
WHERE NO ONE CAN TOUCH HIM.

319
00:11:32,114 --> 00:11:33,114
>> HUH?

320
00:11:33,114 --> 00:11:34,447
>> AHH!

321
00:11:34,447 --> 00:11:35,681
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHERE NO ONE

322
00:11:35,681 --> 00:11:36,981
CAN TOUCH HIM?

323
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:38,814
>> HA HA HA!

324
00:11:38,814 --> 00:11:41,247
UNFORTUNATELY FOR YOU, THAT'S

325
00:11:41,247 --> 00:11:42,681
ALL I KNOW.

326
00:11:42,681 --> 00:11:44,381
>> HUH?

327
00:11:44,381 --> 00:11:46,947
>> NARAKU CUT ME OFF BEFORE HE

328
00:11:46,947 --> 00:11:49,147
COULD ACCOMPLISH HIS PLANS.

329
00:11:49,147 --> 00:11:51,181
I DON'T KNOW WHAT NARAKU INTENDS

330
00:11:51,181 --> 00:11:53,014
TO DO NEXT.

331
00:11:53,014 --> 00:11:55,114
HA HA HA!

332
00:11:55,114 --> 00:11:57,581
SERVES YOU RIGHT!

333
00:11:57,581 --> 00:11:58,681
>> IT APPEARS TO BE TELLING

334
00:11:58,681 --> 00:11:59,781
THE TRUTH.

335
00:11:59,781 --> 00:12:01,414
>> DAMN, NOT A SINGLE SCRAP

336
00:12:01,414 --> 00:12:02,814
WE CAN USE.

337
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:03,747
>> HUH.

338
00:12:03,747 --> 00:12:04,681
IF HE DOESN'T KNOW, THEN THERE'S

339
00:12:04,681 --> 00:12:06,081
NOT MUCH WE CAN DO.

340
00:12:06,081 --> 00:12:08,314
HUH.

341
00:12:08,314 --> 00:12:10,147
NOT MUCH, BUT THERE IS ONE THING

342
00:12:10,147 --> 00:12:11,581
THIS TRASH OF A DEMON

343
00:12:11,581 --> 00:12:13,547
IS GOOD FOR.

344
00:12:13,547 --> 00:12:15,381
YAH!

00:18:10,395 --> 00:18:12,028
>> GOOD-BYE!

518
00:18:12,028 --> 00:18:14,095
>> LUCKY MOVE.

519
00:18:14,095 --> 00:18:15,862
>> YOU KNOW, INUYASHA, I THINK

520
00:18:15,862 --> 00:18:17,395
KOGA'S IDEA ABOUT USING HIS

521
00:18:17,395 --> 00:18:19,295
WOLVES MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

522
00:18:19,295 --> 00:18:20,095
>> NO CHANCE.

523
00:18:20,095 --> 00:18:21,462
IT'S WAY TO SIMPLE.

524
00:18:21,462 --> 00:18:22,862
IF HIS SCENT COULD BE TRACKED,

525
00:18:22,862 --> 00:18:23,995
THEN WHY WOULD NARAKU LEAVE ALL

526
00:18:23,995 --> 00:18:25,295
THIS TRASH BEHIND?

527
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:27,095
HUH.

528
00:18:27,095 --> 00:18:28,895
IT'S THE SOURCE OF HIS SCENT.

529
00:18:28,895 --> 00:18:31,028
IT'D BE WAY TOO SLOPPY.

530
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,095
>> AHH...

531
00:18:32,095 --> 00:18:33,495
>> YOU'RE RIGHT.

532
00:18:33,495 --> 00:18:35,062
>> IT'S LIKE NARAKU'S COMPLETELY

533
00:18:35,062 --> 00:18:36,528
CONFIDENT THAT NO ONE WILL EVER

534
00:18:36,528 --> 00:18:37,828
BE ABLE TO FIND HIM.

535
00:18:37,828 --> 00:18:38,895
HE DOESN'T EVEN CARE

536
00:18:38,895 --> 00:18:40,395
IF ANYONE TRIES.

537
00:18:40,395 --> 00:18:41,128
>> HMM.

538
00:18:41,128 --> 00:18:44,095
THAT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE.

539
00:18:44,095 --> 00:18:45,128
AND...

540
00:18:45,128 --> 00:18:46,395
>> HUH?

541
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:48,162
>> DON'T PLAY DUMB.

542
00:18:48,162 --> 00:18:50,262
WHERE DO YOU THINK NARAKU WENT?

543
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,362
COME ON, SHARE YOUR THEORY

544
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:53,028
WITH US.

545
00:18:53,028 --> 00:18:56,128
>> HUH.

546
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,395
HRMPH.

547
00:18:58,395 --> 00:18:59,462
YOU'LL HAVE TO FIGURE IT OUT

548
00:18:59,462 --> 00:19:00,762
FOR YOURSELF.

549
00:19:00,762 --> 00:19:01,762
>> HUH.

550
00:19:01,762 --> 00:19:02,628
>> IN OTHER WORDS, HE HASN'T

551
00:19:02,628 --> 00:19:03,928
FIGURED IT OUT YET.

552
00:19:03,928 --> 00:19:04,762
>> I'LL HAVE TO BE SHARPER

553
00:19:04,762 --> 00:19:08,362
THAN EVER.

554
00:19:08,362 --> 00:19:13,362
>> INUYASHA'S RIGHT, THOUGH.

555
00:19:13,362 --> 00:19:14,795
THE DEMON SAID THAT NARAKU HAD

556
00:19:14,795 --> 00:19:16,262
ESCAPED TO A PLACE WHERE NO ONE

557
00:19:16,262 --> 00:19:17,895
COULD GET TO HIM.

558
00:19:17,895 --> 00:19:18,762
WHERE WOULD WE EVEN START

559
00:19:18,762 --> 00:19:20,099
TO LOOK?

560
00:19:40,406 --> 00:19:42,220
>> WE WERE CLOSE TO THE RIVER ON

561
00:19:42,220 --> 00:19:44,298
THAT NIGHT, TOO.

562
00:19:53,454 --> 00:19:55,354
I WON'T LET NARAKU GET THE

563
00:19:55,354 --> 00:19:57,187
BETTER OF ME.

564
00:19:57,187 --> 00:19:59,720
BUT THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THAT

565
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,220
I'LL BE ALIVE AFTER I GET

566
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:06,154
MY REVENGE.

567
00:20:06,154 --> 00:20:08,498
AYUMI, FORGET ABOUT THAT

568
00:20:08,498 --> 00:20:11,390
NIGHT WE SAW THE RAINBOW.

569
00:20:32,479 --> 00:20:33,901
>> I WON'T FORGET.

570
00:20:33,901 --> 00:20:36,159
I WON'T EVER FORGET THAT HE

571
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,536
PROTECTED ME...

572
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,794
EVEN IF THE RAINBOW FADES.

573
00:20:45,602 --> 00:20:47,969
>> DAMN IT.

574
00:20:47,969 --> 00:20:51,202
JUST WHEN I BECAME ABLE TO BREAK

575
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:54,202
THROUGH NARAKU'S BARRIER.

576
00:20:54,202 --> 00:20:55,702
>> AHH.

577
00:20:55,702 --> 00:20:57,369
I'M SURE THAT WE'LL FIND NARAKU

578
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,269
SOONER OR LATER IF WE ALL WORK

579
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:00,702
TOGETHER.

580
00:21:00,702 --> 00:21:02,869
>> AND EXACTLY WHO DO YOU MEAN

581
00:21:02,869 --> 00:21:04,069
BY "ALL"?

582
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:06,202
ARE YOU INCLUDING KOGA?

583
00:21:06,202 --> 00:21:08,169
EVEN HIS WOLF DEMON FIANCEE HAS

584
00:21:08,169 --> 00:21:09,302
GIVEN UP ON HIM.

585
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:10,602
IS THAT REALLY THE KIND OF LOW

586
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:12,702
LIFE YOU'RE GONNA DEPEND ON?

587
00:21:12,702 --> 00:21:13,902
>> UH, DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE

588
00:21:13,902 --> 00:21:15,202
STILL JEALOUS.

589
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:16,136
>> OF COURSE NOT.

590
00:21:16,136 --> 00:21:17,236
I'M NOT JEALOUS.

591
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,836
>> YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

592
00:21:18,836 --> 00:21:20,469
>> GRR...

593
00:21:20,469 --> 00:21:23,536
LET'S JUST DROP IT, ALL RIGHT?

594
00:21:23,536 --> 00:21:24,469
>> SURE.

595
00:21:24,469 --> 00:21:26,102
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO STARTED IT.

596
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:29,336
>> GRR...

597
00:21:29,336 --> 00:21:31,302
>> COME ON, WHY DON'T YOU JUST

598
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:37,036
FINISH WHAT YOU WERE SAYING?

599
00:21:37,036 --> 00:21:39,236
>> FORGET IT.

600
00:21:39,236 --> 00:21:41,802
>> NOT LIKELY.

601
00:21:41,802 --> 00:21:44,636
AHH...

602
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:46,436
IF ONLY INUYASHA COULD BE A BIT

603
00:21:46,436 --> 00:21:48,036
MORE OPEN...

604
00:21:48,036 --> 00:21:49,602
LIKE KOGA AND AYUMI ARE WITH

605
00:21:49,602 --> 00:21:52,469
THEIR FEELINGS.

606
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:55,169
A LUNAR RAINBOW.

607
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,802
>> HUH.

608
00:21:56,802 --> 00:21:58,136
AIN'T NO SUCH THING AS A RAINBOW

609
00:21:58,136 --> 00:21:59,902
AT NIGHT.

610
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:01,802
>> THERE IS...

611
00:22:01,802 --> 00:22:04,769
TO THOSE PEOPLE WHO CAN SEE IT.

612
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:07,136
>> REALLY?

613
00:22:07,136 --> 00:22:08,602
UH...

614
00:22:08,602 --> 00:22:10,999
>> AHH...

615
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:32,435
>> [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

616
00:23:58,388 --> 00:23:59,921

00:24:01,788 --> 00:24:03,388
WHO HAVE BEEN QUIET UP UNTIL NOW

619
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,354
HAVE STARTED TO ACT UP.

COMPETITION.

624
00:24:10,088 --> 00:24:11,254

625
00:24:11,254 --> 00:24:13,588
STAND UP TO MANAKORA?

626
