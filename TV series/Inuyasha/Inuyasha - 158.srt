REMOVE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD

WANTS TO BETRAY NARAKU, BUT...

83

THERE'S NO END IN SIGHT.

422
00:18:03,104 --> 00:18:05,604

STILL RELEASING RATS.

424

00:18:10,671 --> 00:18:12,504

00:21:32,038 --> 00:21:33,438
THIS.

514
00:21:33,438 --> 00:21:37,438
>> [THINKING] SISTER.

515
00:21:37,438 --> 00:21:40,071
>> KOHAKU.

516
00:21:40,071 --> 00:21:42,671
ON MY WAY HERE, I SAW SO MANY

517
00:21:42,671 --> 00:21:45,571
VILLAGES DEVOURED BY RATS.

518
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:49,438
HOW I WISH THAT YOU WERE NOT A

519
00:21:49,438 --> 00:21:52,438
PART OF THIS.

520
00:21:52,438 --> 00:21:57,404
>> UHH...

521
00:21:57,404 --> 00:21:58,504
[THINKING] I CAN'T DISOBEY MY

522
00:21:58,504 --> 00:22:03,504
ORDERS.

523
00:22:03,504 --> 00:22:05,604
>> KOHAKU!

524
00:22:05,604 --> 00:22:07,602
>> SANGO!

525
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,099
>> [SINGING IN JAPANESE]

526
00:23:57,124 --> 00:23:58,891
>> DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY VILLAGES

527
00:23:58,891 --> 00:24:00,558
WERE DEVOURED JUST TO LURE KIKYO

528
00:24:00,558 --> 00:24:01,758
OUT OF HIDING?

529
00:24:01,758 --> 00:24:03,791
>> WHEN YOU SEE HER, TELL HER

530
00:24:03,791 --> 00:24:05,358
"AS LONG AS YOU KEEP RUNNING

531
00:24:05,358 --> 00:24:06,891
AWAY FROM NARAKU, THIS WILL

532
00:24:06,891 --> 00:24:09,058
HAPPEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN."

533
00:24:09,058 --> 00:24:10,558
>> KOHAKU, YOU'RE GOING TO END

534
00:24:10,558 --> 00:24:12,391
UP DEVOURED BY THE RATS, TOO.

535
00:24:12,391 --> 00:24:13,391
>> I'M SORRY, SISTER,

536
00:24:13,391 --> 00:24:16,724
BUT I CANNOT DISOBEY MY ORDERS.

537
00:24:16,724 --> 00:24:18,758
>> NEXT TIME, KOHAKU'S DECISION

538
00:24:18,758 --> 00:24:20,224
AND SANGO'S HEART.

539
00:24:20,224 --> 00:24:21,891
>> I MUST DEFEAT NARAKU AS SOON

540
00:24:21,891 --> 00:24:23,891
AS POSSIBLE.
