NARAKU IS PURE EVIL.

180
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,067
HE TAKES ONE STEP ON THE

181
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,200
MOUNTAIN AND HE'D BE PURIFIED

182

MAKE THEM TELL US WHERE NARAKU

00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,800
>> THERE IS NOWHERE YOU CAN RUN.

345
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:23,767
THE LORDS OF THE REGION HAVE

346
00:13:23,767 --> 00:13:24,934
UNITED TO SEE THAT YOU ARE

347
00:13:24,934 --> 00:13:26,892
DESTROYED.

348
00:13:33,034 --> 00:13:34,034
>> WHAT NOW?

349
00:13:34,034 --> 00:13:36,392
>> RUN!

350
00:13:45,367 --> 00:13:46,700
>> YOU ARE TOO DANGEROUS TO

351
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,600
ALLOW TO EXIST, EVEN IN THIS AGE

352
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:51,267
OF WARS.

353
00:13:51,267 --> 00:13:52,367
>> HA!

354
00:13:52,367 --> 00:13:55,434
BEFORE I WAS KILLED, I MYSELF

355
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:58,634
HAD KILLED 999 MEN.

356
00:13:58,634 --> 00:13:59,934
IT'S TIME TO FINALLY EVEN THINGS

357
00:13:59,934 --> 00:14:01,667
UP.

358
00:14:01,667 --> 00:14:02,900
OK, THIS IS IT, MEN.

359
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:03,934
DON'T FAIL.

360
00:14:03,934 --> 00:14:04,934
>> COME ON, I'D NEVER LOSE IN A

361
00:14:04,934 --> 00:14:06,200
REAL BATTLE.

362
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:08,479
>> WELL, YOU BETTER NOT.

363
00:14:14,025 --> 00:14:15,558
>> I WONDER WHEN WE'LL BE ABLE

364
00:14:15,558 --> 00:14:17,358
TO RETURN TO OUR VILLAGE.

365
00:14:17,358 --> 00:14:19,325
>> YEAH, I WANT TO GO HOME.

366
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:20,025
>> HEY!

367
00:14:20,025 --> 00:14:21,658
YOU TWO GET BACK TO YOUR POSTS

368
00:14:21,658 --> 00:14:22,558
IMMEDIATELY.

369
00:14:22,558 --> 00:14:25,558
>> YES, SIR.

370
00:14:25,558 --> 00:14:26,758
>> MY LORD, REINFORCEMENTS WILL

371
00:14:26,758 --> 00:14:28,458
ARRIVE SOON.

372
00:14:28,458 --> 00:14:29,758
WE'VE CONSCRIPTED THE VILLAGERS,

373
00:14:29,758 --> 00:14:31,658
AND NOW I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT

374
00:14:31,658 --> 00:14:34,725
THE CASTLE IS COMPLETELY SECURE.

375
00:14:34,725 --> 00:14:37,925
>> I THINK YOU'RE OVERREACTING.

376
00:14:37,925 --> 00:14:40,125
>> HEY, YOU!

377
00:14:40,125 --> 00:14:41,058
HOLD IT!

378
00:14:41,058 --> 00:14:42,225
WHO ARE YOU?

379
00:14:42,225 --> 00:14:43,958
>> BUT, MY LORD, LISTEN!

380
00:14:43,958 --> 00:14:45,025
GREAT ATROCITIES THOUGHT TO BE

381
00:14:45,025 --> 00:14:46,458
THE WORK OF THE RESURRECTED BAND

382
00:14:46,458 --> 00:14:47,958
OF SEVEN HAVE BEEN REPORTED IN

383
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,858
VARIOUS REGIONS.

384
00:14:49,858 --> 00:14:51,458
AND WHAT OF BANRYU, OUR CLAN'S

385
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:54,225
MOST TREASURED POSSESSION?

386
00:14:54,225 --> 00:14:56,558
>> HEY, I'M HERE TO TAKE BACK MY

387
00:14:56,558 --> 00:14:58,625
COMPANION.

388
00:14:58,625 --> 00:14:59,825
>> IT'S HIM!

389
00:14:59,825 --> 00:15:01,258
>> TAKE HIM!

390
00:15:01,258 --> 00:15:02,292
>> REST EASY.

391
00:15:02,292 --> 00:15:04,058
THE HALBERD BANRYU IS TESTAMENT

392
00:15:04,058 --> 00:15:06,025
THAT WE DESTROYED BANKOTSU, THE

393
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:08,325
LEADER OF THE BAND OF SEVEN.

394
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:09,692
WERE HE TO RETURN, WE WOULD

395
00:15:09,692 --> 00:15:11,292
MERELY KILL HIM AGAIN.

396
00:15:11,292 --> 00:15:12,292
[EXPLOSIONS]

397
00:15:12,292 --> 00:15:13,650
>> WHAT'S THAT?

398
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:20,192
MEN, HOLD YOUR GROUND!

399
00:15:20,192 --> 00:15:21,158
DO NOT ALLOW THEM TO ENTER THE

400
00:15:21,158 --> 00:15:26,792
CASTLE GROUNDS!

401
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:27,892
DON'T--

402
00:15:27,892 --> 00:15:29,190
DON'T PANIC.

403
00:15:35,792 --> 00:15:39,792
>> TAKE THAT!

404
00:15:39,792 --> 00:15:41,558
>> LORD, THEY'RE COMING.

405
00:15:41,558 --> 00:15:42,858
>> JUST STAY CALM.

406
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:46,192
THEY'LL NEVER MAKE IT THIS FAR.

407
00:15:46,192 --> 00:15:48,192
>> OH, THERE YOU ARE.

408
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,658
DID YOU GET MY LETTER?

409
00:15:49,658 --> 00:15:51,392
>> IT'S YOU.

410
00:15:51,392 --> 00:15:53,025
>> BUT WHAT ABOUT MY GUARDS?

411
00:15:53,025 --> 00:15:55,092
>> OH, YOUR GUARDS.

412
00:15:55,092 --> 00:15:56,858
I THINK THEY'RE A LITTLE HUNG UP

413
00:15:56,858 --> 00:15:58,792
RIGHT NOW.

414
00:15:58,792 --> 00:16:00,758
>> BUT HOW DID--

415
00:16:00,758 --> 00:16:02,392
>> OK, THEN.

416
00:16:02,392 --> 00:16:03,592
>> WAIT!

417
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:04,825
JUST LISTEN.

418
00:16:04,825 --> 00:16:06,258
YOU'VE COME HERE TO RECLAIM THE

419
00:16:06,258 --> 00:16:08,158
GREAT HALBERD, HAVE YOU NOT?

420
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:10,592
>> HEY, IT'S MY BANRYU.

421
00:16:10,592 --> 00:16:11,658
>> IT'S YOURS.

422
00:16:11,658 --> 00:16:13,436
TAKE IT.

423
00:16:18,558 --> 00:16:20,625

STRONG MEN TO CARRY IT HERE, AND

425
00:16:23,058 --> 00:16:24,325
YET HE CAN PICK IT UP WITH ONE

426
00:16:24,325 --> 00:16:27,825
HAND.

427
00:16:27,825 --> 00:16:29,058
>> HEY, LOOK.

428
00:16:29,058 --> 00:16:30,358
IT'S SO SHINY.

429
00:16:30,358 --> 00:16:32,692
YOU POLISHED IT, HUH?

430
00:16:32,692 --> 00:16:34,025
>> YES.

431
00:16:34,025 --> 00:16:35,792
LOOK, I DON'T CARE IF YOU ARE A

432
00:16:35,792 --> 00:16:36,892
SPECTER.

433
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,925
WILL YOU SERVE ME?

434
00:16:38,925 --> 00:16:40,425
>> BUT, MY LORD...

435

>> BE MY NEW GENERAL, AND

436
00:16:42,225 --> 00:16:43,525
TOGETHER WE SHALL CONQUER THIS

437
00:16:43,525 --> 00:16:44,592
LAND.

438
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:45,925
>> HEY, COME ON, NOW.

439
00:16:45,925 --> 00:16:47,792
ARE YOU SURE YOU READ MY LETTER?

440
00:16:47,792 --> 00:16:50,258
>> WHAT LETTER?

441
00:16:50,258 --> 00:16:51,358
>> "NO BOUNDS."

442
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:52,592
>> NO BOUNDS?

443
00:16:52,592 --> 00:16:53,558
>> "OUR VENGEANCE WILL KNOW NO

444

BOUNDS"--

445
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:59,025
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

446
00:16:59,025 --> 00:17:01,543
1,000.

447
00:17:05,825 --> 00:17:07,258
>> THE FUN'S OVER FOR NOW, I

448
00:17:07,258 --> 00:17:08,325
GUESS.

449
00:17:08,325 --> 00:17:12,158
>> YEAH.

450
00:17:12,158 --> 00:17:13,458
OOH.

451
00:17:13,458 --> 00:17:15,425
IT JUST GOT FUN AGAIN.

452
00:17:15,425 --> 00:17:16,458
>> I GUESS IT'S TIME FOR THE

453
00:17:16,458 --> 00:17:17,492
NEXT ROUND.

454

BACK.

457

>> YEP, AND IT'S TIME TO TEST IT

458
00:17:24,092 --> 00:17:25,358
OUT.

459
00:17:25,358 --> 00:17:27,325
>> THE CASTLE!

>> HIM AGAIN.

461
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:33,458
HALT.

462

00:17:34,558 --> 00:17:35,825
IT'S BEEN AWHILE.

464
00:17:35,825 --> 00:17:36,825
>> DAMN YOU.

465
00:17:36,825 --> 00:17:39,225
WHAT DID YOU DO WITH OUR LORD?

466
00:17:39,225 --> 00:17:40,458
>> 1,000.

467
00:17:40,458 --> 00:17:41,525
>> WHAT?

468
00:17:41,525 --> 00:17:42,825
>> OUR HEADS WERE CHOPPED OFF,

469
00:17:42,825 --> 00:17:44,892
IF YOU'LL RECALL, SO I RETURNED

470
00:17:44,892 --> 00:17:46,225
THE FAVOR.

471
00:17:46,225 --> 00:17:48,325
>> A CURSE ON YOU.

472
00:17:48,325 --> 00:17:49,525
>> ARE YOU READY TO FOLLOW YOUR

473
00:17:49,525 --> 00:17:52,892
LORD?

474
00:17:52,892 --> 00:17:54,110
>> KILL THEM!

475
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:02,425
>> I FEEL EVEN BETTER THAN WHEN

476
00:18:02,425 --> 00:18:04,264
I WAS ALIVE.

477
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:12,258
>> I SENSE A JEWEL SHARD!

478
00:18:12,258 --> 00:18:13,925
>> NOT ONLY THAT, I SMELL

479
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:16,258
GUNPOWDER AND LOTS OF BLOOD.

480
00:18:16,258 --> 00:18:18,325
THERE'S NO MISTAKE.

481
00:18:18,325 --> 00:18:20,924
THE BAND OF SEVEN ARE UP AHEAD.

482
00:18:35,079 --> 00:18:36,512
>> NOT A SINGLE PERSON LEFT

483
00:18:36,512 --> 00:18:38,179
ALIVE?

484
00:18:38,179 --> 00:18:40,479
THAT'S RATHER INCONVENIENT.

485
00:18:40,479 --> 00:18:41,512
YOU WEREN'T REALLY THINKING,

486
00:18:41,512 --> 00:18:45,912
WERE YOU, JUKOTSU?

487
00:18:45,912 --> 00:18:47,046
YOU COULD HAVE AT LEAST KEPT A

488
00:18:47,046 --> 00:18:48,212
WOMAN OR TWO ALIVE TO POUR OUR

489
00:18:48,212 --> 00:18:49,446
DRINKS.

490
00:18:49,446 --> 00:18:50,279
>> HOW COULD I THINK OF LITTLE

491
00:18:50,279 --> 00:18:52,012
THINGS LIKE THAT, BIG BROTHER?

492
00:18:52,012 --> 00:18:53,279
I'VE GOT MUCH MORE IMPORTANT

493
00:18:53,279 --> 00:18:55,712
THINGS TO WORRY ABOUT, LIKE WHEN

494
00:18:55,712 --> 00:18:57,246
AM I GOING TO SEE MY BELOVED

495
00:18:57,246 --> 00:18:59,179
INUYASHA AGAIN?

496
00:18:59,179 --> 00:19:00,679
>> YOU MUSTN'T WORRY, JUKOTSU.

497
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:02,112
INUYASHA HAS A KEEN SENSE OF

498
00:19:02,112 --> 00:19:02,812
SMELL.

499
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:03,812
>> THAT'S TRUE.

500
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:04,846
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS SIT

501
00:19:04,846 --> 00:19:06,546
PATIENTLY AND INUYASHA WILL

502
00:19:06,546 --> 00:19:07,912
FOLLOW THE SCENT OF BLOOD RIGHT

503
00:19:07,912 --> 00:19:09,512
TO US.

504
00:19:09,512 --> 00:19:10,779
>> YOU THINK SO?

505
00:19:10,779 --> 00:19:11,779
WELL, I GUESS WE JUST WAIT,

506
00:19:11,779 --> 00:19:13,712
THEN.

507
00:19:13,712 --> 00:19:15,512
>> BIG BROTHER, ARE YOU NOT

508
00:19:15,512 --> 00:19:17,579
WORRIED ABOUT NARAKU?

509
00:19:17,579 --> 00:19:18,712
>> WHAT ABOUT HIM?

510
00:19:18,712 --> 00:19:19,612
>> WHY DO YOU THINK HE BROUGHT

511
00:19:19,612 --> 00:19:21,379
US BACK FROM THE DEAD?

512
00:19:21,379 --> 00:19:23,046
>> TO HELP HIM GET RID OF HIS

513
00:19:23,046 --> 00:19:25,212
ENEMIES, SUCH AS THE ONES NAMED

514
00:19:25,212 --> 00:19:27,046
INUYASHA AND KOUGA, THAT'S WHY.

515
00:19:27,046 --> 00:19:29,612
>> BIG BROTHER, YOU'RE THE ONLY

516
00:19:29,612 --> 00:19:30,946
ONE OF THE BAND OF SEVEN WHO'S

517
00:19:30,946 --> 00:19:32,279
MET NARAKU.

518
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:33,379
DO YOU THINK YOU COULD TELL US A

519
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,779
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT HE'S

520
00:19:34,779 --> 00:19:37,012
ACTUALLY LIKE?

521
00:19:37,012 --> 00:19:38,946
>> LISTEN, RENKOTSU.

522
00:19:38,946 --> 00:19:40,112
WE'VE BEEN RESURRECTED AND WE

523
00:19:40,112 --> 00:19:41,812
CAN WREAK HAVOC JUST LIKE THE

GOOD OLD DAYS.

525
00:19:43,446 --> 00:19:45,512
ISN'T THAT GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU?

526
00:19:45,512 --> 00:19:47,046
>> YES.

527
00:19:47,046 --> 00:19:48,179
BIG BROTHER IS DETERMINED NOT TO

528
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,146
TELL ME ANYTHING MORE THAN HE

529
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:50,379
ALREADY HAS.

530
00:19:50,379 --> 00:19:52,912
WHY?

531
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:55,779
>> INUYASHA, I REALLY HOPE YOU

532
00:19:55,779 --> 00:20:01,679
GET HERE SOON.

533
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:07,179
>> SOME KIND OF WHIRLWIND.

534
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:08,646
>> I ASSUME YOU ARE THE BAND OF

535
00:20:08,646 --> 00:20:09,779
SEVEN.

536
00:20:09,779 --> 00:20:11,679
>> OH, HEY THERE, KOUGA.

537
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,846
>> WELL, WELL, WELL.

538
00:20:12,846 --> 00:20:13,946
SO THE WOLF GETS HERE BEFORE THE

539
00:20:13,946 --> 00:20:15,146
DOG, I SEE.

540
00:20:15,146 --> 00:20:17,079
>> QUIT ACTING SO SMUG.

541
00:20:17,079 --> 00:20:18,279
I KNOW FOR A FACT YOU'RE IN

542
00:20:18,279 --> 00:20:20,412
CAHOOTS WITH NARAKU.

543
00:20:20,412 --> 00:20:22,046
SO TELL ME WHERE HE IS.

544
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:23,412
>> GEE, IT SEEMS THAT THIS

545
00:20:23,412 --> 00:20:24,779
NARAKU CHARACTER HAS MADE

546
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:27,612
ENEMIES OF A LOT OF PEOPLE.

547
00:20:27,612 --> 00:20:29,312
>> TELL ME WHERE HE IS!

548
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:31,879
>> IT REALLY MAKES ME WONDER, DO

549
00:20:31,879 --> 00:20:34,079
YOU THINK HE CAN BE TRUSTED?

550
00:20:34,079 --> 00:20:35,512
>> WHY ARE YOU ASKING ME?

551
00:20:35,512 --> 00:20:36,979
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO'S MET

552
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:39,146
HIM, BANKOTSU.

553
00:20:39,146 --> 00:20:41,679
>> IF YOU REFUSE TO TELL ME,

554
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:45,146
I'LL KILL YOU!

555
00:20:45,146 --> 00:20:46,979
>> RIGHT, I NEARLY FORGOT.

556
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,279
WE STILL HAVE A MATCH TO FINISH.

557
00:20:49,279 --> 00:20:50,779
>> NICE TRY.

558
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:51,612
I ALREADY KNOW ABOUT THAT

559
00:20:51,612 --> 00:20:53,346
SNAKEBITE SWORD OF YOURS, AND IT

560
00:20:53,346 --> 00:20:58,012
AIN'T GOING TO WORK!

561
00:20:58,012 --> 00:20:59,212
>> DAMN.

562
00:20:59,212 --> 00:21:00,579
HE AVOIDED THE SHOT.

563
00:21:00,579 --> 00:21:03,046
>> HEY, YOU'RE A QUICK ONE,

564
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,446
AREN'T YOU?

565
00:21:04,446 --> 00:21:05,579
I THINK IT MUST BE BECAUSE OF

566
00:21:05,579 --> 00:21:07,246
THE SHIKON JEWEL SHARDS IN YOUR

567

>> WHAT DID YOU--

569
00:21:10,912 --> 00:21:11,946
>> THAT REMINDS ME.

570
00:21:11,946 --> 00:21:13,246
NARAKU ASKED ME IF I WOULD TAKE

571
00:21:13,246 --> 00:21:17,946
THOSE FOR HIM.

572
00:21:17,946 --> 00:21:19,304
>> THIS GUY...

573
00:21:28,112 --> 00:21:29,612
>> I DON'T GET IT.

574
00:21:29,612 --> 00:21:30,546
THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT

575
00:21:30,546 --> 00:21:32,546
ABOUT THIS ONE.

576
00:21:32,546 --> 00:21:34,112
>> HEY, EVERYONE, DON'T LET HIM

577
00:21:34,112 --> 00:21:35,830
GET AWAY!

578

>> MOVE, YOU WIMPY WOLF!

580
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:03,779
