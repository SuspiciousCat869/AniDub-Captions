1
00:01:43,873 --> 00:01:44,939
>> WE CONTINUE OUR JOURNEY

2
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:46,073
HOPING TO GATHER THE SACRED

3
00:01:46,073 --> 00:01:47,606
JEWEL SHARDS BEFORE NARAKU GETS

4
00:01:47,606 --> 00:01:49,306
TO THEM.

5
00:01:49,306 --> 00:01:50,706
WE HEAR ABOUT A VILLAGE OF DEMON

6
00:01:50,706 --> 00:01:52,773
WOMEN, AND SOON FIND A PLACE

7
00:01:52,773 --> 00:01:55,506
OCCUPIED ONLY BY WOMEN.

8
00:01:55,506 --> 00:01:57,039
BUT WE SEE NOTHING SUSPICIOUS

9
00:01:57,039 --> 00:01:58,773
AND DECIDE TO LEAVE RIGHT AWAY.

10
00:01:58,773 --> 00:02:00,139
THAT IS, UNTIL MIROKU'S BAD

11
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:01,606
HABITS SURFACE AGAIN,

12
00:02:01,606 --> 00:02:04,606
AND WE END UP STAYING ONE NIGHT.

13
00:02:04,606 --> 00:02:11,639
OR AT LEAST THAT WAS THE PLAN.

14
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:13,606
>> WHAT'S GOING ON?

15
00:02:13,606 --> 00:02:15,206
>> I'M GOING TO FOLLOW THEM.

16
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:16,306
>> HEY, WAIT!

17
00:02:16,306 --> 00:02:17,339
I'LL GET INUYASHA AND MIROKU

18
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:20,073
TO COME ALONG, TOO.

19
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:21,206
THEY'RE PROBABLY CLOSE BY,

20
00:02:21,206 --> 00:02:22,473
SO IT'LL JUST TAKE A SEC--

21
00:02:22,473 --> 00:02:23,773
>> NEVER MIND, THERE'S NO TIME

22
00:02:23,773 --> 00:02:26,273
TO LOOK FOR THEM.

23
00:02:26,273 --> 00:02:31,773
>> WAIT, SANGO.

24
00:02:31,773 --> 00:02:32,606
>> AAH!

25
00:02:32,606 --> 00:02:35,273
>> [MOANING]

26
00:02:35,273 --> 00:02:38,339
>> AAH!

27
00:02:38,339 --> 00:02:41,006
UHH--

28
00:02:41,006 --> 00:02:42,606
AAH!

29
00:02:42,606 --> 00:02:46,273
UHH...UH...

30
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:48,373
AAH!

31
00:02:48,373 --> 00:02:49,273
>> HA HA HA.

32
00:02:49,273 --> 00:02:50,673
>> WHERE AM I?

33
00:02:50,673 --> 00:02:51,773
>> AND NOW WE SHALL MAKE YOU

34
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:57,439
ONE OF US.

35
00:02:57,439 --> 00:03:01,039
HERE, SWALLOW IT.

36
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,939
SWALLOW IT WITHOUT BITING,

37
00:03:02,939 --> 00:03:05,039
AND VERY SOON THE EGG WILL HATCH

38
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:07,539
INSIDE YOUR STOMACH AND YOU,

39
00:03:07,539 --> 00:03:11,239
TOO, SHALL BECOME ONE OF US.

40
00:03:11,239 --> 00:03:12,839
>> NO WAY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA

41
00:03:12,839 --> 00:03:16,839
MAKE ME SWALLOW THAT THING.

42
00:03:16,839 --> 00:03:18,439
>> UHH!

43
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,573
TELL ME, WHAT KIND OF DEMON

44
00:03:19,573 --> 00:03:20,639
ARE YOU?

45
00:03:20,639 --> 00:03:21,806
>> HA HA HA!

46
00:03:21,806 --> 00:03:23,006
I WANT YOUR FLESH!

47
00:03:23,006 --> 00:03:25,006
GIVE ME YOUR FLESH!

48
00:03:25,006 --> 00:03:26,739
>> WAKANA!

49
00:03:26,739 --> 00:03:29,006
WAKANA, HOW I'VE SEARCHED

50
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:32,539
FOR YOU, MY DEAREST.

51
00:03:32,539 --> 00:03:33,606
>> WHAT'S THAT?

52
00:03:33,606 --> 00:03:34,273
>> OH, NO--

53
00:03:34,273 --> 00:03:40,873
KAGOME, GET BACK!

54
00:03:40,873 --> 00:03:41,639
HEY, YOU, WHAT'D YOU DO WITH

55
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,439
SANGO?

56
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:44,506
IF YOU HID HER SOMEWHERE,

57
00:03:44,506 --> 00:03:45,606
YOU BETTER TELL ME.

58
00:03:45,606 --> 00:03:47,406
>> INUYASHA, WAIT!

59
00:03:47,406 --> 00:03:48,139
THERE'S SOME KIND OF DEMONIC

60
00:03:48,139 --> 00:03:49,306
VAPOR SEEPING OUT OF THEIR

61
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:54,139
MOUTHS.

62
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,339
>> UHH!

63
00:03:55,339 --> 00:03:56,906
>> HMM, SO THIS IS THE VILLAGE

64
00:03:56,906 --> 00:03:58,239
OF DEMON WOMEN WE WERE LOOKING

65
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,706
FOR ALL ALONG.

66
00:03:59,706 --> 00:04:19,549
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW IT.

67
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:20,549
>> YOU WANT ME TO GIVE YOU

68
00:04:20,549 --> 00:04:21,583
MY FLESH?

69
00:04:21,583 --> 00:04:23,949
>> HA HA HA.

70
00:04:23,949 --> 00:04:24,649
>> I HEARD THE RUMORS ABOUT

71
00:04:24,649 --> 00:04:25,849
A VILLAGE OF DEMON WOMEN WHO

72
00:04:25,849 --> 00:04:26,949
WERE SKINNING THEIR POOR VICTIMS

73
00:04:26,949 --> 00:04:30,949
ALIVE.

74
00:04:30,949 --> 00:04:32,216
SO, YOU'RE THE ONE WHO HAS

75
00:04:32,216 --> 00:04:34,049
POSSESSED THESE INNOCENT WOMEN.

76
00:04:34,049 --> 00:04:35,783
>> EXACTLY.

77
00:04:35,783 --> 00:04:37,983
I NEEDED TO FIND MALE FLESH

78
00:04:37,983 --> 00:04:39,449
IN ORDER TO RETURN TO MY

79
00:04:39,449 --> 00:04:40,749
FORMER SELF.

80
00:04:40,749 --> 00:04:41,516
>> WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

81
00:04:41,516 --> 00:04:42,716
YOUR FORMER SELF?

82
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,183
>> I SUPPOSE THERE'S NO HARM

83
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:46,316
IN EXPLAINING...

84
00:04:46,316 --> 00:04:47,716
SINCE YOU'RE GOING TO DIE

85
00:04:47,716 --> 00:04:53,216
VERY SOON ANYWAY.

86
00:04:53,216 --> 00:04:54,816
I WAS ONCE THE DEMON THAT RULED

87
00:04:54,816 --> 00:04:56,949
OVER THE NEARBY MARSH.

88
00:04:56,949 --> 00:04:59,216
ONE DAY, I WAS EXORCISED

89
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,716
BY A MONK AND SEALED WITHIN

90
00:05:00,716 --> 00:05:01,916
A SCROLL.

91
00:05:01,916 --> 00:05:03,816
AND NOT SATISFIED WITH THAT,

92
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,983
THOSE HUMANS TORE AWAY MY FLESH

93
00:05:05,983 --> 00:05:07,616
AND PAINTED A KANNON ON THE

94
00:05:07,616 --> 00:05:08,883
SCROLL.

95
00:05:08,883 --> 00:05:10,149
THEY COMPLETELY RESTRICTED

96
00:05:10,149 --> 00:05:17,816
MY MOVEMENTS.

97
00:05:17,816 --> 00:05:18,716
THE FOOLS.

98
00:05:18,716 --> 00:05:20,316
THEY SEALED ME UP, BUT MY SOUL

99
00:05:20,316 --> 00:05:21,849
DID NOT DIE.

100
00:05:21,849 --> 00:05:22,983
I'VE WAITED PATIENTLY FOR THE

101
00:05:22,983 --> 00:05:24,983
MOMENT OF MY RESURRECTION,

102
00:05:24,983 --> 00:05:27,349
AND NOW YOU SHALL BECOME A PART

103
00:05:27,349 --> 00:05:28,816
OF ME!

104
00:05:28,816 --> 00:05:29,883
>> UHH!

105
00:05:29,883 --> 00:05:32,216
SACRED SUTRA!

106
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,716
>> AAH!

107
00:05:33,716 --> 00:05:37,049
AAH!

108
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:39,283
TRY AND RUN, YOU CANNOT

109
00:05:39,283 --> 00:05:41,349
ESCAPE ME.

110
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:46,349
HUH?

111
00:05:46,349 --> 00:05:47,683
>> YOU CAN'T IMAGINE HOW GLAD

112
00:05:47,683 --> 00:05:49,916
I AM TO FIND YOU'RE ALIVE.

113
00:05:49,916 --> 00:05:54,149
>> I, TOO, AM GLAD, SHINOSUKE.

114
00:05:54,149 --> 00:05:55,783
>> HA HA HA HA.

115
00:05:55,783 --> 00:05:58,149
EXCELLENT, WAKANA.

116
00:05:58,149 --> 00:05:59,516
WE'LL LEAVE THE BOTHERSOME MONK

117
00:05:59,516 --> 00:06:01,016
FOR LATER.

118
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:02,483
RIGHT NOW, I SHALL TAKE THAT

119
00:06:02,483 --> 00:06:07,983
YOUNG MAN'S FLESH INSTEAD.

120
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:09,083
>> UHH!

121
00:06:09,083 --> 00:06:11,183
AAH!

122
00:06:11,183 --> 00:06:12,749
>> INUYASHA, PLEASE TAKE IT EASY

123
00:06:12,749 --> 00:06:13,416
ON THEM.

124
00:06:13,416 --> 00:06:14,916
THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY EVIL,

125
00:06:14,916 --> 00:06:15,649
THEY'RE BEING CONTROLLED

126
00:06:15,649 --> 00:06:17,416
BY SOMEONE.

127
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,716
>> I KNOW THAT.

128
00:06:18,716 --> 00:06:20,316
I'M NOT IN THE HABIT OF HITTING

129
00:06:20,316 --> 00:06:24,016
WOMEN.

130
00:06:24,016 --> 00:06:24,816
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GOING

131
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:28,516
TO KEEP THEM OFF.

132
00:06:28,516 --> 00:06:29,716
THERE ARE TOO MANY OF THEM,

133
00:06:29,716 --> 00:06:31,883
DAMN IT ALL.

134
00:06:31,883 --> 00:06:33,383
>> NOT GOOD.

135
00:06:33,383 --> 00:06:34,816
THE GIRL'S GONE MISSING, MAYBE

136
00:06:34,816 --> 00:06:38,883
SHE RETURNED TO THAT SHRINE.

137
00:06:38,883 --> 00:06:39,816
I'M GUESSING THAT ALL THE

138
00:06:39,816 --> 00:06:40,949
WOMEN IN THE VILLAGE ARE BEING

139
00:06:40,949 --> 00:06:42,449
CONTROLLED BY THAT DEMON,

140
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:44,949
WHATEVER IT IS.

141
00:06:44,949 --> 00:06:46,583
THE QUESTION IS, HOW DO I GET

142
00:06:46,583 --> 00:06:51,083
THEM BACK TO NORMAL?

143
00:06:51,083 --> 00:06:53,016
HEY, THAT'S...

144
00:06:53,016 --> 00:06:54,049
>> WAKANA?

145
00:06:54,049 --> 00:06:55,649
WHERE ARE YOU TAKING ME?

146
00:06:55,649 --> 00:07:00,416
>> OH, INSIDE THE KANNON SHRINE.

147
00:07:00,416 --> 00:07:02,049
>> WAKANA, THE FIANCEE THAT

148
00:07:02,049 --> 00:07:05,183
SHINOSUKE WAS SEARCHING FOR.

149
00:07:05,183 --> 00:07:06,849
WAIT, SHINOSUKE, YOU MUSTN'T

150
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:09,449
GO WITH HER!

151
00:07:09,449 --> 00:07:11,083
SHINOSUKE!

152
00:07:11,083 --> 00:07:12,049
>> HUH?

153
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:13,316
>> RUN FOR IT!

154
00:07:13,316 --> 00:07:15,749
>> IT'S THE MONK MIROKU.

155
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:16,849
>> GET AWAY FROM THERE!

156
00:07:16,849 --> 00:07:18,016
>> MIROKU SEEMS CONCERNED, BUT

157
00:07:18,016 --> 00:07:19,583
I CAN'T HEAR WHAT HE'S SAYING.

158
00:07:19,583 --> 00:07:23,716
>> RUN AWAY!

159
00:07:23,716 --> 00:07:25,483
>> UHH, OH, NO!

160
00:07:25,483 --> 00:07:27,083
UHH!

161
00:07:27,083 --> 00:07:28,516
CURSE IT ALL, MY SPELL

162
00:07:28,516 --> 00:07:31,849
IS BROKEN.

163
00:07:31,849 --> 00:07:33,016
>> OH.

164
00:07:33,016 --> 00:07:34,816
>> WHAT'S GOING ON, WAKANA?

165
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,716
WHAT ON EARTH IS THAT THING?

166
00:07:37,716 --> 00:07:39,249
>> SHINOSUKE, LISTEN TO ME,

167
00:07:39,249 --> 00:07:41,016
TAKE WAKANA AND ESCAPE.

168
00:07:41,016 --> 00:07:42,716
>> BUT WHAT'S GOING ON?

169
00:07:42,716 --> 00:07:43,783
>> HURRY!

170
00:07:43,783 --> 00:07:47,316
>> UHH, RIGHT!

171
00:07:47,316 --> 00:07:48,116
>> I'LL HAVE TO USE MY

172
00:07:48,116 --> 00:07:56,716
WIND TUNNEL.

173
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:58,249
