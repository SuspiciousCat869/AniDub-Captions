2
00:01:45,934 --> 00:01:47,767
NARAKU'S BARRIER, BUT BEFORE

3
00:01:47,767 --> 00:01:49,601
INUYASHA COULD FINISH HIM OFF,

4
00:01:49,601 --> 00:01:51,501

5
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:55,434
INJURED.

6
00:01:55,434 --> 00:01:57,267
THE ONLY REASON HE GOT AWAY WAS

7
00:01:57,267 --> 00:01:58,967
BECAUSE HE RESORTED TO A DIRTY

8
00:01:58,967 --> 00:02:01,434
TRICK--USING KOHAKU.

9
00:02:01,434 --> 00:02:03,301
SURPRISINGLY, IT WAS SESSHOMARU

10
00:02:03,301 --> 00:02:04,922
THAT SAVED KOHAKU.

11
00:02:09,467 --> 00:02:11,367
NARAKU HAD DISAPPEARED, AND WE

12
00:02:11,367 --> 00:02:12,867
WERE ACTUALLY GRATEFUL TO HAVE A

13
00:02:12,867 --> 00:02:14,567
BIT OF A BREATHER, ESPECIALLY

14

INUYASHA.

15
00:02:18,934 --> 00:02:20,801
SO ON WE GO, CONTINUING OUR

16
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,867
JOURNEY TO DESTROY NARAKU AND

17
