A SHIELD AGAINST THE TETSUSAIGA.

00:24:00,823 --> 00:24:03,804
THEY'RE CONTROLLED BY A MAN
WITH 3 JEWEL SHARDS.

312
00:24:03,838 --> 00:24:07,459
IT LOOKS LIKE THE DEMONS
ARE BATTLING FOR TERRITORY
IN THIS NECK OF THE WOODS.

313
00:24:07,493 --> 00:24:10,015
A DARK SHADOW
CUTS THROUGH THE WIND.

314
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:12,915
I CAN FEEL IT.
IS IT ANOTHER
SACRED JEWEL SHARD?

315
00:24:12,948 --> 00:24:15,248
DO I SENSE THE ONES
ON HIS ARMS AND LEGS?

316
00:24:15,281 --> 00:24:18,881
NO. I FEEL IT COMING
FROM THE SKY.

317
00:24:18,915 --> 00:24:22,248
NEXT ON "INUYASHA"...

318
00:24:23,293 --> 00:24:24,293
SEE YOU SOON.
