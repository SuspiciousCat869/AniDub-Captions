USELESS OLD MAN.
ALL THAT WORK FOR NOTHING?

367
00:21:05,548 --> 00:21:06,748

368
00:21:06,781 --> 00:21:09,814
AND HE LEFT
JUST WHEN I WAS
GOING TO TELL HIM.

369
00:21:09,848 --> 00:21:11,148
- TELL HIM WHAT?

370
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:13,314
- HE LABORED SO HARD
AND PERSEVERED,

371
00:21:13,348 --> 00:21:17,014
SO I THOUGHT I SHOULD TEACH HIM
THE METHOD TO BECOME STRONGER,

372
00:21:17,048 --> 00:21:19,548
AND THUS ENABLE HIM
TO BREAK THE BARRIER.

373
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:21,781
- IS IT THE METHOD
THAT I'M THINKING OF?

374
00:21:21,814 --> 00:21:25,381
- YES.
YOU TELL HIM FOR ME, WOULD YOU?

375
00:21:25,414 --> 00:21:26,914
- COUNT ON IT.
