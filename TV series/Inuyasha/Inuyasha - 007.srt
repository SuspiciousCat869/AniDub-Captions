FOREVER AND EVER?

322
00:21:07,637 --> 00:21:08,504
- HUH?

323
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,737
WHAT IN THE WORLD
ARE YOU BABBLING ABOUT?

324
00:21:10,771 --> 00:21:12,437
YOUR BRAIN'S BROKEN
OR SOMETHING.

325
00:21:12,471 --> 00:21:15,504
- BUT YOU SAID
I SHOULD LET YOU PROTECT ME!

326
00:21:15,537 --> 00:21:17,337
- I DIDN'T MEAN IT
LIKE THAT!

327
00:21:17,371 --> 00:21:19,371
IF YOU'LL SHUT UP FOR A MINUTE,

328
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:21,204
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT A SWORD LIKE THIS

329
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:23,071
SHOULD REALLY
BE USED FOR.

330
00:21:23,104 --> 00:21:25,737
STUFF LIKE
COLLECTING JEWEL SHARDS

331
00:21:25,771 --> 00:21:27,637
AND MAKING ME MORE POWERFUL.

332
00:21:27,671 --> 00:21:29,504
I SURE AS HECK
AIN'T WASTING IT

333
00:21:29,537 --> 00:21:33,737
ON BABY-SITTING A HELPLESS
LITTLE HUMAN LIKE YOU.

334
00:21:33,771 --> 00:21:35,271
- HMPH!

335
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:39,071
- I DON'T GET IT.

336
00:21:39,104 --> 00:21:40,771
- HMPH!

337
00:21:43,237 --> 00:21:44,771
SIT, BOY.

338
00:21:45,471 --> 00:21:46,704
IT'S MY FAULT FOR THINKING

339
00:21:46,737 --> 00:21:49,737
I COULD TEACH AN OLD DOG
A NEW TRICK.

340
00:21:49,771 --> 00:21:52,104
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN "TRICK"?

341
00:21:52,137 --> 00:21:54,104
WAIT! WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

342
00:21:54,137 --> 00:21:55,071
COME BACK HERE!

343
00:21:55,104 --> 00:21:59,104
YOU SAID YOU'D TELL ME
HOW TO USE THE SWORD!

344
00:22:09,877 --> 00:22:13,710
[WOMAN SINGING IN JAPANESE]

345
00:23:40,110 --> 00:23:42,243
- SESSHOMARU'S DOWN,
BUT HE'S NOT OUT.

346
00:23:42,276 --> 00:23:46,676
PLUS, HIS LEFT ARM
IS STILL INSIDE
THEIR FATHER'S TOMB.

347
00:23:49,010 --> 00:23:50,976
NOW THAT INUYASHA
HAS TETSUSAIGA,

348
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,710
THE SEARCH FOR MORE
JEWEL SHARDS CONTINUES.

349
00:23:53,743 --> 00:23:55,910
THEY'LL BE A TOWN,
SOME KIDNAPPED GIRLS,

350
00:23:55,943 --> 00:24:00,176
AND A YOUNG SAMURAI
TRYING TO SAVE THE PRINCESS.

351
00:24:00,176 --> 00:24:03,059
NEXT TIME...

352
00:24:03,059 --> 00:24:04,059
SEE YOU SOON!
