53
00:03:25,612 --> 00:03:26,479
>> YES, THEY SEEM LIKE

54
00:03:26,479 --> 00:03:27,879
GOOD PEOPLE.

55
00:03:27,879 --> 00:03:30,179
>> I'M MORE WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

56
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:31,379
THE WORLD OF HUMANS SEEMS TO BE

57
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,546
GOING THROUGH TROUBLED TIMES.

58

>> ESPECIALLY NOW THAT

61
00:03:44,079 --> 00:03:45,579
I'VE MET YOU.

67
00:03:57,312 --> 00:03:58,146
>> PROBABLY RUBBED OFF FROM

68
00:03:58,146 --> 00:03:59,412
A CERTAIN SOMEBODY WE ALL

69
00:03:59,412 --> 00:04:02,879
KNOW ONLY TOO WELL.

70
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,746
>> OF COURSE WE'LL GET RID

71
00:04:03,746 --> 00:04:04,746
OF THIS DEMON THAT'S BEEN

72
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:07,079
PLAGUING YOUR VILLAGE, GOOD SIR.

73
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:09,012
HOWEVER, IF IT IS INDEED HIDING

74
00:04:09,012 --> 00:04:10,846
UP IN THE MOUNTAINS, IT MAY TAKE

75
00:04:10,846 --> 00:04:12,979
US SOME TIME TO CLEAR IT OUT.

76
00:04:12,979 --> 00:04:14,312
>> OH, WE ARE VERY WELL AWARE

77
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:16,546
OF THAT.

78
00:04:16,546 --> 00:04:17,546
>> GOOD.

79
00:04:17,546 --> 00:04:19,846
NOW THEN, ABOUT OUR LODGING.

80
00:04:19,846 --> 00:04:21,379
>> PLEASE STAY HERE AS LONG

81
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,546
AS YOU WISH.

82
00:04:23,546 --> 00:04:24,846
>> DO YOU SUPPOSE WE COULD ASK

83
00:04:24,846 --> 00:04:26,046
THE YOUNG LADIES TO TAKE CARE

84
00:04:26,046 --> 00:04:27,079
OF US?

85
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,679
>> CERTAINLY, I'LL ASK SOME

86
00:04:28,679 --> 00:04:29,812
OF THE YOUNG MAIDENS OVER

87
00:04:29,812 --> 00:04:31,746
TO HELP OUT AT DINNER.

88
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,512
>> AND THROUGH THE NIGHT

89
00:04:32,512 --> 00:04:33,579
AS WELL?

90
00:04:33,579 --> 00:04:35,612
AAH!

91
00:04:35,612 --> 00:04:36,646
>> LET'S NOT IMPOSE ON OUR

92
00:04:36,646 --> 00:04:38,312
HOSTS, MONK.

93
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,412
>> NOW...NOW, EASY, SANGO.

94
00:04:40,412 --> 00:04:42,079
>> COME ON, GIVE ME A BREAK.

95
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:43,012
I DON'T KNOW WHAT ALL THE FUSS

96
00:04:43,012 --> 00:04:44,046
IS ABOUT.

97
00:04:44,046 --> 00:04:44,879
FROM WHAT I'VE HEARD IT'S JUST

98
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,812
A PUNY LITTLE DEMON ANYWAY.

99
00:04:46,812 --> 00:04:47,679
AND IF IT DOESN'T GET US

100
00:04:47,679 --> 00:04:49,579
ANY CLOSER TO THE JEWEL SHARDS,

101
00:04:49,579 --> 00:04:50,512
THEN I'M NOT INTERESTED

102
00:04:50,512 --> 00:04:51,846
IN THE LEAST.

103
00:04:51,846 --> 00:04:52,746
>> PLEASE, GOOD SIR,

104
00:04:52,746 --> 00:04:54,046
DON'T SAY THAT.

105
00:04:54,046 --> 00:04:55,879
>> HEY, WHY SHOULD I CARE?

106
00:04:55,879 --> 00:04:57,246
THE SOONER WE LEAVE THIS DUMP

107
00:04:57,246 --> 00:04:58,746
OF A VILLAGE THE BETTER.

108

00:05:16,012 --> 00:05:17,879
FRIENDS ALWAYS SO VIOLENT?

117
00:05:17,879 --> 00:05:18,646
>> THEY'RE JUST IMMATURE

118
00:05:18,646 --> 00:05:19,846
I GUESS.

119
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,412
BUT DON'T YOU WORRY, I'M ALWAYS

120

124
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:29,979
>> AND YOU LOOK AFTER THINGS

125
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:31,712
HERE, OK, INUYASHA?

126
00:05:31,712 --> 00:05:32,646
>> YEAH, YEAH.

BESIDES, WHAT HAPPENS IF

131
00:05:37,846 --> 00:05:39,079
THE DEMON ATTACKS THE VILLAGE

132
00:05:39,079 --> 00:05:40,712
WHILE EVERYONE IS GONE?

133
00:05:40,712 --> 00:05:41,679

00:23:44,266 --> 00:23:45,399
KAGOME?

00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,366
MIROKU AND I DON'T HAVE THAT

694
00:23:46,366 --> 00:23:47,966

>> I THINK MIROKU HAS FEELINGS

696
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:50,799

00:23:55,766 --> 00:23:58,766
COME OUT AT A TIME OF CRISIS.
