- THE FEELING'S MUTUAL.

318
00:18:47,509 --> 00:18:52,609
- YOU KNOW WHAT? I REALLY DON'T
LIKE THE LOOK OF YOUR FACE.

319
00:18:52,643 --> 00:18:54,343
SAY, HAVE WE EVER
MET BEFORE?

320
00:18:54,376 --> 00:18:56,109
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT OBVIOUSLY,

321
00:18:56,143 --> 00:18:58,643
THIS CONVERSATION
IS GOING NOWHERE FAST.

322
00:18:58,676 --> 00:18:59,609
- INUYASHA, NO.

323
00:18:59,643 --> 00:19:02,343
- SOMEONE WHO SMELLS
EXACTLY LIKE NARAKU

324
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,343
IS KILLING
INNOCENT PEOPLE.

325
00:19:04,376 --> 00:19:06,709
HE DESERVES TO DIE!

326
00:19:07,843 --> 00:19:10,676
- JUST TRY IT! GRR!

327
00:19:10,709 --> 00:19:12,443
- HYAH!

328
00:19:12,476 --> 00:19:16,843
DIE!

329
00:19:18,209 --> 00:19:19,776
- HE DID IT!

330
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:23,709
- NOT YET.

331
00:19:25,143 --> 00:19:27,243
- WHAT'S HIS BODY
MADE OF?

332
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:31,043
IT'S LIKE...
CLAY OR SOMETHING.

333
00:19:31,076 --> 00:19:33,076
UH!

334
00:19:37,309 --> 00:19:39,143
- NARAKU'S POISON INSECTS!

335
00:19:39,176 --> 00:19:41,043
- HUH?

336
00:19:46,543 --> 00:19:48,143
- AAH!

337
00:19:51,576 --> 00:19:52,576
- HIS ARM'S BACK!

338
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,543
- HE'S ABSORBING THE POISON
INSECTS INTO HIS BODY.

339
00:19:56,576 --> 00:20:00,543
MY WIND TUNNEL WILL BE
USELESS AGAINST HIM.

340
00:20:00,943 --> 00:20:03,909
- I'M MORE AMAZING
THAN I THOUGHT I WAS.

341
00:20:03,943 --> 00:20:06,109
SO, WHAT'S IN THAT VILLAGE
OVER THERE?

342
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,443
- HUH? WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

343
00:20:08,476 --> 00:20:10,576
- THAT VILLAGE
IS CALLING ME.

344
00:20:10,609 --> 00:20:12,376
IF I SLAUGHTER
THE VILLAGERS,

345
00:20:12,409 --> 00:20:15,376
MAYBE THIS TIME,
I'LL REMEMBER SOMETHING.

346
00:20:15,409 --> 00:20:16,809

- WHAT?
- STAY BACK! AAH!

351

- NICE. THIS WILL DO
JUST FINE.

00:20:31,609 --> 00:20:34,243
- HMM! THERE!

355
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:36,576
- WE'VE GOT A FIGHT
ON OUR HANDS.

356
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,243
WE MUST USE
EXTREME CAUTION.

357
00:20:38,276 --> 00:20:40,709
- YES, ESPECIALLY SINCE
HE'S NARAKU'S CREATION.

358
00:20:40,743 --> 00:20:44,009
- I'LL BRING HIM DOWN!
HYAH!

WHAT WAS...THAT VISION?

371
00:21:10,809 --> 00:21:12,843
- HE'S ONE OF NARAKU'S
INCARNATIONS.

372
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,276
STAY BACK
AND OUT OF DANGER.

YET HE CLAIMS
HE'S NEVER HEARD OF HIM.

394
00:24:04,285 --> 00:24:08,419
- KAGRA TELLS INUYASHA
THAT MUSO IS IN THE CAVE,

395
00:24:08,452 --> 00:24:10,685
WHERE 50 YEARS AGO,
KIKYO TENDED

TO THE BANDIT ONIGUMO.

397
00:24:13,085 --> 00:24:16,052
- IT MIGHT BE A TRAP, BUT WE
SHOULD FIND SOME ANSWERS THERE.

398
00:24:16,085 --> 00:24:19,785
- MEANWHILE, NARAKU SETS OUT
TO DESTROY KIKYO.

NEXT TIME, ONIGUMO'S
MEMORY RESTORED.
