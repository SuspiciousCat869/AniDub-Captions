HE GAVE ALL THE DEMON SLAYERS
PROPER BURIALS.

WHEN YOU KILL KOHAKU
AND WHEN YOU ARE

- AWFUL. HOW COULD HE?

WHERE ARE YOU?

235
00:15:17,852 --> 00:15:21,196
- KOHAKU KILLED HIS FATHER
AND HIS FELLOW VILLAGERS.

236
00:15:21,229 --> 00:15:23,704
HE MASSACRED AN ENTIRE TOWN.

237
00:15:23,737 --> 00:15:26,212
YET HIS SISTER SAYS
SHE CANNOT KILL HIM.

238
00:15:26,245 --> 00:15:30,625
SHE LOVES HER BROTHER
MORE DEARLY THAN
SHE LOVES HER OWN LIFE.

239
00:15:30,658 --> 00:15:32,331
HOW CAN THIS BE?

240
00:15:32,364 --> 00:15:34,906
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND.

00:15:40,590 --> 00:15:42,162
- HUH?

242
00:15:42,195 --> 00:15:43,165
KOHAKU?

243
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:48,047
- YOU'LL BE ABLE TO GAIN
FULL CONSCIOUSNESS SOON.

00:15:48,248 --> 00:15:51,558
- INUYASHA, THIS IS WHAT
HAPPENED TO YOU 50 YEARS AGO.

245
00:15:51,591 --> 00:15:54,568
NARAKU TRIED TO SET YOU UP
AGAINST THE ONE YOU LOVE.

246
00:15:54,601 --> 00:15:55,537
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

247
00:15:55,571 --> 00:15:57,944
- NARAKU TRIED TO MAKE SANGO
HATE HER BROTHER.

248
00:15:57,978 --> 00:15:59,750
HE HOPED THAT
SHE WOULD KILL HIM.

249
00:15:59,784 --> 00:16:01,924
THEN THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD
IN HIS BACK

250
00:16:01,957 --> 00:16:04,699
WOULD BECOME EVEN MORE EVIL.

251
00:16:04,733 --> 00:16:07,341
- HE TRICKED KIKYO AND INUYASHA
THE SAME WAY,

252
00:16:07,374 --> 00:16:09,548
MADE THEM HATE
AND BETRAY EACH OTHER

253
00:16:09,581 --> 00:16:10,885
SO THEY'D FIGHT.

254
00:16:10,919 --> 00:16:11,955
THAT'S SO EVIL.

255
00:16:11,988 --> 00:16:13,961
I CAN'T BELIEVE
HE'D DO THAT ON PURPOSE.

256
00:16:13,995 --> 00:16:18,910
KIKYO DIED SO THAT
THE SACRED JEWEL
WOULD REMAIN DORMANT.

257
00:16:18,944 --> 00:16:21,117
SANGO REFUSED
TO FIGHT HER BROTHER

258
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:24,261
FOR THE VERY SAME REASON.

259
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:27,838
NARAKU IS SUCH A TOTAL IDIOT.

260
00:16:27,872 --> 00:16:30,581
SANGO WILL NEVER DO
WHAT HE WANTS HER TO DO.

261
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:32,920
SHE'S A KIND PERSON,
AND NO MATTER WHAT,

262
00:16:32,953 --> 00:16:35,131
SHE WILL ALWAYS LOVE
HER LITTLE BROTHER.

- YEAH. STAY RIGHT
WHERE YOU ARE
AND DON'T BUDGE.

00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:21,338
I GOT A THING OR TWO
TO CHEW YOU OUT FOR,

276
00:17:21,372 --> 00:17:24,481
SO DON'T YOU DARE DIE ON ME,
YOU UNDERSTAND THAT?

277
00:17:24,514 --> 00:17:27,056
- IT'S ALL MY FAULT.

278
00:17:30,099 --> 00:17:32,138
BUT...

279
00:17:35,483 --> 00:17:38,726
BUT I CAN GIVE YOU THIS.

280
00:17:43,006 --> 00:17:44,845
- OHH.

281
00:17:48,423 --> 00:17:51,299
- I KNOW.
NARAKU HAS JEWEL SHARDS.

282
00:17:51,333 --> 00:17:53,071
I CAN FIND HIM!

283
00:17:53,104 --> 00:17:54,944
OVER THERE!

284
00:17:56,816 --> 00:17:59,825
NARAKU, TAKE THIS!

285
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:07,985
- UNH! AAH!

286
00:18:09,924 --> 00:18:11,362
- WHAT?

287
00:18:11,396 --> 00:18:13,803
- NARAKU!

288
00:18:13,836 --> 00:18:15,910
YOU ARE TOTALLY DESPICABLE.

289
00:18:15,943 --> 00:18:18,317
NOW...DIE!

290
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:19,421
- SHE'S ONLY A YOUNG GIRL.

291
00:18:19,454 --> 00:18:21,192
WHY DOES SHE HAVE SO MUCH POWER?

292
00:18:21,226 --> 00:18:23,767
SHE'S RENDERED THE VAPORS
HARMLESS SOMEHOW.

293
00:18:23,801 --> 00:18:28,482
THIS KIND OF POWER ONLY BELONGS
TO THE PRIESTESS KIKYO.

294
00:18:28,515 --> 00:18:29,385
CAN'T BE.

295
00:18:29,418 --> 00:18:30,421
- I WON'T LET YOU GO,

296
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:33,230
EVEN IF YOU BEG FOR FORGIVENESS.

297

HA!

298
00:18:38,547 --> 00:18:42,526
- THIS IS EXACTLY LIKE
KIKYO'S ENCHANTED ARROW.

299
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:45,067
DON'T TELL ME THIS GIRL IS...

- SHE DID IT!

THE CASTLE DISAPPEARED!

- IT WAS A PHANTOM CASTLE.

00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:41,617
- LOOK.
- HUH?

317
00:19:46,566 --> 00:19:49,141
DO YOU THINK NARAKU ESCAPED?

318
00:19:49,174 --> 00:19:50,445
- MM-HMM.

319
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:51,381
HE MUST HAVE.

320
00:19:51,415 --> 00:19:52,833
I DON'T SEE ANY JEWEL SHARDS.

321
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:54,953
- DAMN IT.

322
00:19:54,986 --> 00:19:55,956
- I'M SORRY.

323
00:19:55,989 --> 00:19:57,527
I COULDN'T KILL HIM.

324
00:19:57,561 --> 00:19:59,232
- NO NEED TO APOLOGIZE, KAGOME.

325
00:19:59,266 --> 00:20:01,206
WE SHOULD BE THANKING YOU.

326
00:20:01,239 --> 00:20:04,348
WITHOUT YOU,
WE'D ALL BE DEAD BY NOW.

327
00:20:04,383 --> 00:20:07,693
- KAGOME, I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
FIGHT LIKE THAT BEFORE.

328
00:20:07,726 --> 00:20:09,699
IT WAS ALMOST AS GOOD AS ME.

329
00:20:09,732 --> 00:20:10,736
- LISTEN, INUYASHA.

330
00:20:10,769 --> 00:20:13,712
WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN
TO DESTROY NARAKU,

331
00:20:13,745 --> 00:20:15,651
NO MATTER HOW HARD
WE HAVE TO WORK.

332
00:20:15,684 --> 00:20:17,891
WE'VE GOT TO PULL TOGETHER
AS A TEAM.

333
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,697
- DON'T TRY TO
MOVE AROUND, SANGO.

334
00:20:19,731 --> 00:20:21,235
YOU'RE BADLY HURT.

335
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:23,476
- SANGO, WAIT!

336
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:24,546
- SOMEBODY HELP ME STOP HER!

337
00:20:24,579 --> 00:20:26,552
SHE'S TRYING TO GET UP AND WALK!

338
00:20:26,585 --> 00:20:27,922
- SANGO, WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

339
00:20:27,957 --> 00:20:30,665
REST A WHILE.
WE'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

340
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:31,869
- I'M SORRY.

341
00:20:32,181 --> 00:20:34,159
I CAN'T STAY WITH YOU
ANY LONGER.

342
00:20:34,192 --> 00:20:37,670
- SANGO, WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT
NARAKU WAS THREATENING YOU

343
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:38,539
WITH THE LIFE OF YOUR BROTHER

344
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:40,445
IF YOU DIDN'T
GIVE HIM OVER THE SWORD.

345
00:20:40,479 --> 00:20:43,488
- EXACTLY! I'LL END UP
BETRAYING YOU AGAIN!

346
00:20:43,521 --> 00:20:46,731
AS LONG AS NARAKU
STILL CONTROLS KOHAKU...

347
00:20:46,765 --> 00:20:47,969
- BUT, SANGO, PLEASE...

348
00:20:48,002 --> 00:20:49,440
- SO WHAT DO YOU INTEND TO DO,

349
00:20:49,474 --> 00:20:50,878
GO AFTER NARAKU ON YOUR OWN?

350
00:20:50,911 --> 00:20:52,850
YOU'LL NEVER SUCCEED THAT WAY.

351
00:20:52,885 --> 00:20:55,827
- I DON'T HAVE
ANY OTHER CHOICE, MIROKU.

352
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,629
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS.

353
00:20:56,662 --> 00:20:58,201
WE'LL ALL WORK TOGETHER
AS A TEAM

354
00:20:58,234 --> 00:20:59,471
AND TRY TO SAVE YOUR BROTHER.

355
00:20:59,505 --> 00:21:03,985
- YOU NEED MORE THAN ONE PERSON
TO HANDLE THAT KIND OF OPPONENT.

356
00:21:04,019 --> 00:21:07,263
- NOW THAT THAT'S SETTLED,
LET'S TEND TO YOUR WOUNDS.

357
00:21:07,296 --> 00:21:09,369
- BUT WHY WOULD YOU
STILL HELP ME?

358
00:21:09,402 --> 00:21:11,609
- WILL YOU STOP WHINING, SANGO?

359
00:21:11,643 --> 00:21:12,446
WE WANT YOU TO STICK WITH US

360
00:21:12,479 --> 00:21:13,816
BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT
A HALF-BAD FIGHTER,

361
00:21:13,850 --> 00:21:15,488
AND THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT!

362
00:21:15,522 --> 00:21:17,662
- INUYASHA, I'M IMPRESSED.

363
00:21:17,695 --> 00:21:20,337
- YOU SEE? EVEN INUYASHA
WANTS YOU TO STAY,

364
00:21:20,371 --> 00:21:21,708
AND THAT'S SOMETHING
COMING FROM A GUY

365
00:21:21,741 --> 00:21:24,349
WHOSE SWORD YOU STOLE
SO EASILY--

366
00:21:24,383 --> 00:21:25,219
- DON'T SAY THAT!

367
00:21:25,252 --> 00:21:26,490
IT MAKES ME SOUND LIKE
A STUPID HALF-WIT!

368
00:21:26,523 --> 00:21:28,797
- I'M JUST SAYING YOU'RE
A VERY GENEROUS PERSON,

369
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:29,566
THAT'S ALL.

370
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,341
- SANGO, DON'T YOU
LIKE US ANYMORE?

371
00:21:32,375 --> 00:21:33,345
- OF COURSE I DO,

372
00:21:33,378 --> 00:21:35,251
BUT IT'S ALL MY FAULT
THAT THIS HAPPENED,

373
00:21:35,284 --> 00:21:38,642
AND I MIGHT END UP
DOING SOMETHING LIKE THIS
TO ALL OF YOU AGAIN.

374
00:21:39,001 --> 00:21:41,142
BUT...

375
00:21:41,175 --> 00:21:43,683
[CRYING]

376
00:21:46,057 --> 00:21:47,127
- POOR SANGO.

377
00:21:47,161 --> 00:21:50,301
THIS WHOLE THING MUST HAVE BEEN
HEARTBREAKING FOR HER.

378
00:21:52,369 --> 00:21:55,387
IT'S GONNA BE OK, SANGO.
I PROMISE.

379
00:21:56,125 --> 00:21:58,825
WE'RE HERE WITH YOU NOW.

380
00:22:03,956 --> 00:22:05,756
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

381
00:23:38,943 --> 00:23:41,976
- WE JUST HEARD ABOUT AN HERB
THAT WILL HELP KILALA.

382
00:23:42,010 --> 00:23:44,048
SHE WAS POISONED
WHEN SHE BIT INTO NARAKU

383
00:23:44,081 --> 00:23:45,399
AND IS REALLY ILL.

384
00:23:45,432 --> 00:23:48,532
SO INUYASHA AND I GO OUT
IN SEARCH OF THIS
HEALING HERB GARDEN,

385
00:23:48,565 --> 00:23:52,099
AND WE COME ACROSS A HUGE DEMON
WORKING IN THE FIELD.

386
00:23:52,132 --> 00:23:53,832
HE'S OBVIOUSLY REALLY STRONG,

387
00:23:53,865 --> 00:23:56,165
AND HE LOOKS FIERCE
AND DANGEROUS,

388
00:23:56,199 --> 00:23:57,132
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

389
00:23:57,165 --> 00:23:58,932
THERE'S SOMETHING DIFFERENT
ABOUT THIS DEMON.

390
00:23:58,965 --> 00:24:00,904
HIS EYES HAVE
A KINDNESS TO THEM.

391
00:24:01,333 --> 00:24:03,233
NEXT TIME...

392
00:24:04,733 --> 00:24:05,733
SEE YOU SOON!
