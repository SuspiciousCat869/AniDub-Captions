SICKLY AND FRAIL.

91
00:04:31,821 --> 00:04:33,088
THERE WAS NEVER A DAY WHEN SHE

92
00:04:33,088 --> 00:04:34,321
COULD EVEN LIFT HER HEAD FROM A

93
00:04:34,321 --> 00:04:36,454
PILLOW.

94
00:04:36,454 --> 00:04:37,554
THAT'S WHEN MIROKU PASSED

95
00:04:37,554 --> 00:04:38,854
THROUGH THE VILLAGE.

96
00:04:38,854 --> 00:04:42,188
THIS WAS 2 YEARS AGO NOW.

97

>> AND, AS ONE WOULD EXPECT FROM

101
00:04:48,654 --> 00:04:50,288
SUCH COSTLY MEDICINE, IT

102
00:04:50,288 --> 00:04:52,021
COMPLETELY CURED HER!

103
00:04:52,021 --> 00:04:53,354
>> IT CERTAINLY WAS EXPENSIVE

104
00:04:53,354 --> 00:04:56,288
MEDICINE, THOUGH.

105
00:04:56,288 --> 00:04:59,254

106
00:04:59,254 --> 00:05:00,788
>> AND THE 2 OF YOU BECAME FAST

107

FRIENDS?

108
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:02,921
>> NO.

109
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,054
>> MIROKU GAVE US THE MEDICINAL

110
00:05:04,054 --> 00:05:05,521
HERBS THEN VANISHED ALMOST AS

111
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:07,588
SUDDENLY AS HE HAD APPEARED.

112
00:05:07,588 --> 00:05:08,888
>> HEAR THAT?

113
00:05:08,888 --> 00:05:10,688
INNOCENT OF ANY WRONG DOINGS.

114
00:05:10,688 --> 00:05:12,121

115
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:14,221
>> EXCEPT?

116
00:05:14,221 --> 00:05:15,321
I HOPE WHEN YOU ARE WELL, YOU

117
00:05:15,321 --> 00:05:16,354
WOULD CONSIDER BEARING MY CHILD,

118
00:05:16,354 --> 00:05:17,854
SHIMA.

119
00:05:17,854 --> 00:05:20,088
>> YES!

120
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:21,854
2 THINGS KEPT ME GOING.

121
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:23,588
THE EXPENSIVE MEDICINAL HERB AND

122
00:05:23,588 --> 00:05:25,421
THE PROMISE I MADE TO MONK

123
00:05:25,421 --> 00:05:26,521
MIROKU.

124
00:05:26,521 --> 00:05:27,588
THAT'S HOW I COMPLETELY

125
00:05:27,588 --> 00:05:29,354
RECOVERED.

126
00:05:29,354 --> 00:05:30,321
>> SEE?

127
00:05:30,321 --> 00:05:33,488
YOU WERE TRYING TO SEDUCE HER!

128
00:05:33,488 --> 00:05:34,554
>> IT'S OK.

129
00:05:34,554 --> 00:05:35,354
AFTER ALL, IT WAS A THING OF THE

130
00:05:35,354 --> 00:05:36,488
PAST.

131
00:05:36,488 --> 00:05:37,754
>> SO BIG DEAL.

132
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:38,688
IT DIDN'T MATTER THEN AND IT

133
00:05:38,688 --> 00:05:40,054
DOESN'T MATTER NOW.

134
00:05:40,054 --> 00:05:41,421
>> IT IS A BIG DEAL.

135
00:05:41,421 --> 00:05:42,788
>> ISN'T THE EVIL SPIRIT THE

136
00:05:42,788 --> 00:05:44,154
REASON WE'RE HERE?

137
00:05:44,154 --> 00:05:45,188
>> HE'S RIGHT.

138
00:05:45,188 --> 00:05:46,321
TELL US MORE ABOUT THE INCIDENT

139
00:05:46,321 --> 00:05:50,054

>> HUH?

144
00:05:56,788 --> 00:05:58,188
I'M SCARED, TOO, BUT FOR A WHOLE

145
00:05:58,188 --> 00:06:00,721
DIFFERENT REASON.

146
00:06:00,721 --> 00:06:01,854
>> MIROKU, PLEASE DO WHATEVER

147
00:06:01,854 --> 00:06:04,088
YOU CAN TO HELP US.

148

>> IF NOTHING IS DONE, OUR

149
00:06:05,354 --> 00:06:06,388
DAUGHTER WILL END UP THE WIFE OF

150
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:07,621
A DEMON.

151
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:09,054
>> SHIMA'S TO MARRY A DEMON?

152
00:06:09,054 --> 00:06:10,654
>> YES, YES!

153
00:06:10,654 --> 00:06:11,854
THE SHRINE YOU SAW IS DEDICATED

154
00:06:11,854 --> 00:06:13,188
TO THE MASTER OF THE LAKE, AND

155
00:06:13,188 --> 00:06:14,954
MASTER HAS DEMANDED SHIMA TO BE

156
00:06:14,954 --> 00:06:17,788
HIS WIFE.

157
00:06:17,788 --> 00:06:19,388
>> I'VE TRIED TO EXPLAIN TO HIM

158
00:06:19,388 --> 00:06:20,754
THAT I AM BETROTHED, BUT HE

159
00:06:20,754 --> 00:06:22,821
REFUSES TO BELIEVE ME.

160
00:06:22,821 --> 00:06:24,721
>> HMM.

161
00:06:24,721 --> 00:06:27,188
SO SHIMA, WHO WOULD YOUR

162
00:06:27,188 --> 00:06:28,288
BETROTHED BE?

163
00:06:28,288 --> 00:06:30,154
>> THAT'D BE YOU; WHO ELSE?

164
00:06:30,154 --> 00:06:31,554
>> HUH.

165
00:06:31,554 --> 00:06:32,854
>> MIROKU, I'M SO DELIGHTED THAT

166
00:06:32,854 --> 00:06:34,054
YOU REMEMBERED OUR PROMISE AND

167
00:06:34,054 --> 00:06:35,188
RETURNED TO THE VILLAGE AFTER

168
00:06:35,188 --> 00:06:36,688
ALL THIS TIME.

169
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,788
YOU DON'T KNOW HOW I'VE WAITED

170
00:06:37,788 --> 00:06:40,954
FOR THIS DAY TO COME.

171
00:06:40,954 --> 00:06:43,154
>> AH.

172
00:06:43,154 --> 00:06:44,988
RIGHT, I UNDERSTAND.

173
00:06:44,988 --> 00:06:46,154
IN ANY CASE, WE WON'T HAND YOU
