00:23:47,698 --> 00:23:49,465
I BET I'LL GET AN "A"
IN HISTORY,

491
00:23:49,498 --> 00:23:52,665
BUT I STILL DON'T GO ANYWHERE
WITHOUT AN AUTOGRAPH BOOK.

492
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:54,298
DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD GET A CAMERA?

493
00:23:54,332 --> 00:23:56,432
DEMONS ARE PRETTY SCARY
IN GENERAL,

494
00:23:56,465 --> 00:23:58,432
BUT SOMETIMES THERE'S CUTE ONES,

495
00:23:58,465 --> 00:24:00,598
LIKE HIM, FOR EXAMPLE.

496
00:24:00,632 --> 00:24:04,565
NEXT TIME...

497
00:24:04,598 --> 00:24:05,598
SEE YOU SOON!
