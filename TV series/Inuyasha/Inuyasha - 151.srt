00:16:37,054 --> 00:16:38,620
IT'S A WATERFALL!

347
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,420
>> HEY, WAIT.

348
00:16:39,420 --> 00:16:40,420
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

349
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,320
>> LET'S FOLLOW HIM.

350
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,120
WHO KNOWS.

351
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,054
THE BARRIER MIGHT HAVE BEEN

352
00:16:43,054 --> 00:16:55,087
DISPELLED.

353
00:16:55,087 --> 00:16:55,987
>> YOU MUST MAKE YOUR

354
00:16:55,987 --> 00:16:56,987
DECISION...

355
00:16:56,987 --> 00:16:57,920
>> WHETHER OR NOT YOU WILL SAVE

356
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,754
HER.

357
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,487
>> I CAN'T BELIEVE THOSE 2.

358
00:17:01,487 --> 00:17:02,487
LIKE THEY WERE TESTING ME OR

359
00:17:02,487 --> 00:17:04,387
SOMETHING.

360
00:17:04,387 --> 00:17:06,854
WHAT WERE THEY TRYING TO PROVE?

361
00:17:06,854 --> 00:17:09,487
WAS THIS ABOUT INUYASHA?

362
00:17:09,487 --> 00:17:10,554
DID SHE THINK I WOULDN'T SAVE

363
00:17:10,554 --> 00:17:12,987
HER BECAUSE SHE'S IN MY WAY?

364
00:17:12,987 --> 00:17:15,254
THAT'S GOTTA BE IT!

365
00:17:15,254 --> 00:17:17,754
OF ALL THE DIRTY TRICKS!

366
00:17:17,754 --> 00:17:19,020
HOW THEY EVEN THINK I COULD BE

367
00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:20,354
THAT AWFUL?

368
00:17:20,354 --> 00:17:22,954
ARGH!

369
00:17:22,954 --> 00:17:25,387

370
00:17:25,387 --> 00:17:30,454

IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR KIKYO,

378
00:17:41,054 --> 00:17:42,454
SHE'S ALREADY GONE.

379
00:17:42,454 --> 00:17:44,420
WHY DON'T YOU GO AFTER HER?

380
00:17:44,420 --> 00:17:45,354
>> YOU MEAN KIKYO WAS ACTUALLY

381

HERE?

382
00:17:46,887 --> 00:17:49,587
>> YES, BUT SHE LEFT AWHILE AGO.

383
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:51,587
I TOLD HER TO STAY AND SEE YOU,

384
00:17:51,587 --> 00:17:53,020
REALLY.

385
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:55,154
>> HUH?

386
00:17:55,154 --> 00:17:56,920
>> I KNEW IT.

387
00:17:56,920 --> 00:18:00,987
HE'S HAPPY.

388
00:18:00,987 --> 00:18:02,887
>> INUYASHA, WHAT'LL YOU DO?

389
00:18:02,887 --> 00:18:08,720
GO AFTER HER?

390
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,654
>> KAGOME, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN

391
00:18:10,654 --> 00:18:15,254
WITH YOU AND KIKYO?

392
00:18:15,254 --> 00:18:16,487
>> I FELT SO DETERMINED WHEN IT

393
00:18:16,487 --> 00:18:18,054
WAS HAPPENING.

394
00:18:18,054 --> 00:18:19,020
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D FEEL LIKE

395
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,420
THIS NOW.

396
00:18:21,420 --> 00:18:23,254
>> KAGOME!

397
00:18:23,254 --> 00:18:24,687
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?

398
00:18:24,687 --> 00:18:25,854
WHAT'S WITH THE LONG FACE?

399
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:26,920
IT'S NOT LIKE YOU!

400
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:27,987
>> OH, BE QUIET.

407
00:18:34,887 --> 00:18:38,187
>> SHE LOOKS SCARY.

408

>> I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU THINK I

409
00:18:39,154 --> 00:18:40,520
DID, BUT YOU BETTER KNOCK IT OFF

410
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,820
BEFORE I GET SERIOUSLY MAD!

411

FAULT.

THESE THINGS.

419

>> LOOK AT POOR KAGOME.

422
00:19:00,587 --> 00:19:02,187
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN HER LOOK SO

423
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,520
SAD AND DEJECTED?

424
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:07,820
>> YEAH, SO WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

425
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:09,487
>> INUYASHA, LET ME ASK YOU ONE

426
00:19:09,487 --> 00:19:11,287
QUESTION.

427
00:19:11,287 --> 00:19:13,354
ARE YOUR SURE YOU DON'T WANT TO

428
00:19:13,354 --> 00:19:14,954
GO AFTER KIKYO?

429
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:17,087
>> IT'S HARDLY EVEN AN OPTION.

430
00:19:17,087 --> 00:19:18,987
NOT WITH KAGOME LIKE THIS.

431
00:19:18,987 --> 00:19:20,420
>> SO YOU MEAN IF KAGOME HAD

432
00:19:20,420 --> 00:19:22,020
SENT YOU OFF WITH A SMILE, YOU'D

433
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:31,454
HAVE GONE?

434
00:19:31,454 --> 00:19:33,120
>> I'M TOTALLY THE WORST.

435
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:34,554
I WAS UPSET AND TOOK IT ALL OUT

436
00:19:34,554 --> 00:19:36,287
ON INUYASHA.

437
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:42,587
OH, MAYBE HE HATES ME NOW.

438
00:19:42,587 --> 00:19:44,654
HUH?

439
00:19:44,654 --> 00:19:46,854
WHAT IS IT?

440
00:19:46,854 --> 00:19:49,354
>> ARE YOU STILL MAD AT ME?

441
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:57,554
>> AREN'T YOU GOING AFTER KIKYO?

442
00:19:57,554 --> 00:19:58,720
>> WHEN I WAS UP THERE ALONE AT

443
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,187
THE BASE OF THE MOUNTAIN, I MET

444
00:20:00,187 --> 00:20:02,420
SAINT HAJIDI, BUT IT TURNED OUT

445
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:08,120
TO BE KIKYO'S PUPPET.

446
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,020
I FOUND OUT THAT THE REAL KIKYO

447
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:12,354
WAS OVERCOME BY NARAKU'S MIASMA

448
00:20:12,354 --> 00:20:13,687
AND THAT HER LIFE WAS NEARING

449
00:20:13,687 --> 00:20:18,620
ITS END.

450
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:20,620
HOW'S KIKYO?

451
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:23,454
I MEAN HOW DID SHE SEEM?

452
00:20:23,454 --> 00:20:24,520
>> BADLY INJURED AND

453
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
UNCONSCIOUS.

454
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:27,820
BUT THEN...

455
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:29,720
I MANAGED TO PURIFY THE MIASMA,

456
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:32,820
SO I THINK SHE'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

457
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,854
>> YOU MEAN YOU DID THAT FOR

458
00:20:33,854 --> 00:20:35,520
HER?

459
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,454
>> YEAH.

460
00:20:37,454 --> 00:20:38,654
>> HMM.

461
00:20:38,654 --> 00:20:40,854
I SEE.

462
00:20:40,854 --> 00:20:42,287
>> IT'S ONLY NATURAL.

463
00:20:42,287 --> 00:20:43,254
OF COURSE HE'D BE WORRIED ABOUT

464
00:20:43,254 --> 00:20:46,987
HER.

465
00:20:46,987 --> 00:20:49,354
INUYASHA, GO AFTER KIKYO.

466
00:20:49,354 --> 00:20:50,787
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

467
00:20:50,787 --> 00:20:52,387
>> I'M NOT!

468
00:20:52,387 --> 00:20:53,854
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SHOULDN'T BE

469
00:20:53,854 --> 00:20:54,987
WORRIED.

470
00:20:54,987 --> 00:20:57,087
YOU SAVED KIKYO, DIDN'T YOU?

471
00:20:57,087 --> 00:20:58,420
>> UH-HUH.

472
00:20:58,420 --> 00:21:00,187
>> WELL, THEN SHE'S GOTTA BE OK.

473
00:21:00,187 --> 00:21:02,720
I WON'T GO AFTER HER.

474
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,020
>> ARE YOU SURE?

475
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,187
SERIOUSLY?

476
00:21:05,187 --> 00:21:07,687
>> YEAH!

477
00:21:07,687 --> 00:21:09,320
SO TAKE BACK WHAT YOU SAID

478
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:10,587
EARLIER.

479
00:21:10,587 --> 00:21:11,620

LITTLE WHILE AGO.

484
00:21:15,920 --> 00:21:17,087
>> REALLY?

485
00:21:17,087 --> 00:21:18,187
DID I SAY THAT?

486
00:21:18,187 --> 00:21:19,620
>> GAA!

487
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:20,554
