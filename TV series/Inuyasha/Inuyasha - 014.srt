OK, NOW I'M OFFICIALLY FREAKED.

SOME OF THE VIOLENCE?

ACTING SO WEIRD.

- HMM?
- HUH?

- KAEDE.
- I HAVE RECONSIDERED.

173
00:11:08,443 --> 00:11:09,543
- I, TOO, AM A PRIESTESS.

174
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,909
I SHALL RECOVER
MY SISTER'S ASHES
ON MY OWN STRENGTH.

175
00:11:12,943 --> 00:11:15,209
INUYASHA, DO ME THE KINDNESS
OF TELLING ME

176
00:11:15,243 --> 00:11:17,909
WHICH DIRECTION URASUE

TO GET YOURSELF KILLED?

YOU'RE WASTING YOUR BREATH
TRYING TO STOP HER.

YOU'LL NEVER TALK HER OUT OF IT.

HAD BETTER COME WITH YOU.

LOOKING AT JUST NOW.

HE WAS LOOKING RIGHT THROUGH ME,
TO KIKYO.

ALREADY?

THEY'RE NOT FAR OFF.

HE FELL ASLEEP.

00:12:39,243 --> 00:12:42,376
HE WAS SLEEPING THE FIRST TIME
I SAW HIM, TOO.

200
00:12:42,409 --> 00:12:44,209
ACTUALLY, HE WAS UNDER A SPELL,

201
00:12:44,243 --> 00:12:48,143
BUT TO ME, IT LOOKED LIKE
HE WAS MERELY ASLEEP.

202
00:12:48,176 --> 00:12:51,343
I THOUGHT HE HATED KIKYO.

203
00:12:52,976 --> 00:12:56,209
I GET IT!
THIS ALL ABOUT ME
LOOKING LIKE KIKYO.

204
00:12:56,243 --> 00:13:00,209
THAT'S IT, ISN'T IT?

[GASP]

00:13:13,143 --> 00:13:15,643
WHEN HE HELD MY HAND
AND LOOKED AT ME,

210
00:13:15,676 --> 00:13:19,243
IT WASN'T A LOOK OF HATRED
IN HIS EYES.

211
00:13:20,809 --> 00:13:23,876
MY HEART'S STILL POUNDING.

212
00:13:26,109 --> 00:13:27,276
COULD IT BE THAT...

213
00:13:27,309 --> 00:13:30,809
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT HE'S BEEN
HIDING HIS FEELINGS ALL ALONG?

214
00:13:30,843 --> 00:13:33,809
THAT HE ACTUALLY LOVED KIKYO?

[BIRDS CHIRPING]

216

KIKYO'S REMAINS QUICKLY,

LEST URASUE USE THEM
TO SOME EVIL END.

DREADFUL TROUBLE.

- OH, GOOD.
THAT'S JUST WHAT
WE NEED TO HEAR.

IF YOU WERE SO WORRIED
ABOUT HER REMAINS,

222
00:13:56,709 --> 00:13:59,843
WHY DIDN'T YOU
SCATTER THEM IN THE RIVER
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

WE WOULDN'T BE

FOR MAN'S
GRAVESITES AND TOMBSTONES?

227
00:14:08,443 --> 00:14:14,243
A GRAVE IS MORE THAN SIMPLY
A PLACE TO BURY A BODY OR ASHES.

228
00:14:14,276 --> 00:14:17,743
IT IS A PLACE OF REFUGE,
OF SHELTER FOR THE HEARTS

OF THOSE LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND.

- THE LOVED ONES LEFT BEHIND?

231
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,809
- MY SISTER WAS BORN
A PRIESTESS.

SHE USED HER POWERS
FOR THE GOOD OF THE VILLAGERS.

233
00:14:29,043 --> 00:14:32,609
SHE WARDED SPECTERS AND DEMONS
AWAY FROM THE VILLAGE

234
00:14:32,643 --> 00:14:37,443
AND BATTLED ILLNESS AND FAMINE
COUNTLESS TIMES.

235
00:14:38,043 --> 00:14:39,176
EVER SINCE HER DEMISE,

236
00:14:39,209 --> 00:14:42,176
KIKYO'S SPIRIT
CONTINUES TO ENCOURAGE THEM

00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:43,843
TO OVERCOME THEIR OBSTACLES

238
00:14:43,876 --> 00:14:45,709
AND HAVE THE STRENGTH
TO CARRY ON.

239

BY THE WINDS OF DANGER
AND UNCERTAINTY.

HER GRAVE WAS A PLACE
OF REASSURANCE, A HAVEN,

AGAINST THE STORMS OF LIFE.

HE DID BEFORE.

245
00:15:06,176 --> 00:15:09,176
HE'S THINKING OF KIKYO.

246
00:15:10,343 --> 00:15:11,843
HE WAS IN LOVE WITH HER,

247
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:14,243
AND YET SHE SHOT HIM
WITH AN ARROW

248

AND PINNED HIM TO A TREE,

249

00:15:26,143 --> 00:15:29,609
- SHE DIDN'T
RETURN HIS FEELINGS.

253
00:15:29,643 --> 00:15:30,743
- HMM.

254
00:15:30,776 --> 00:15:36,043

SHE DIDN'T LOVE HIM.

WHAT ARE YOU GAWKING AT?

257
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:41,976
THAT'S PRETTY BAD, WHEN YOU CAN

258

EVEN GIVE A HALF-DEMON
THE CREEPS.

259
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,343
- HEH HEH HEH.
- WHAT'S WITH THE SYMPATHETIC
LOOKS YOU'RE GIVING ME?

260
00:15:46,376 --> 00:15:50,109
- OH, NOTHING.
I WAS JUST THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING STUPID.

261
00:15:50,143 --> 00:15:51,943
- HMM.
STUPID LIKE WHAT?

262
00:15:51,976 --> 00:15:54,676
- FORGET IT.
[LAUGHS]
- OUT WITH IT!

263
00:15:54,709 --> 00:15:58,076
KAGOME, I WANT SOME ANSWERS NOW!

ARISE, KIKYO.
COME TO ME.

275
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:31,586
KIKYO, THE GREAT PRIESTESS.

276
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:34,120
YOU FOILED MANY AN ATTEMPT
BY DEMONS AND MONSTERS

277
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:39,253
TO TAKE POSSESSION
OF THE SACRED JEWEL

IF A DEMON SHOULD POSSESS

280
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:44,820
BUT A SINGLE SHARD
OF THE BROKEN JEWEL,

281
00:17:44,853 --> 00:17:50,720
ITS POWERS AS A DEMON
WILL AT LEAST DOUBLE
IN STRENGTH.

282
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,253
I NEED THEM.

283
00:17:52,286 --> 00:17:55,420
I MUST HAVE EVERY FRAGMENT
OF THE JEWEL FOR MYSELF.

284
00:17:55,453 --> 00:17:57,720
GO FORTH AND DESTROY EVERY DEMON

I HAVE BROUGHT YOU BACK,

I'LL GO ON MY OWN
AND GET THE REMAINS BACK, OK?
