>> HERE WE COME.

2
00:00:06,951 --> 00:00:08,984
IT'S THE START OF "INUYASHA."

3
00:00:08,984 --> 00:00:10,051
>> WE'RE GOING TO GATHER ALL THE

4
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:11,884
SHARDS OF THE SACRED JEWEL.

5
00:00:11,884 --> 00:00:13,118
>> AND I'LL DESTROY NARAKU WITH

6
00:00:13,118 --> 00:00:14,618
MY TETSUSAIGA.

7
00:00:14,618 --> 00:00:15,484
>> MOUNT HAKUREI BEGINS TO

8
00:00:15,484 --> 00:00:16,884
DISINTEGRATE, AND INUYASHA GOES

9
00:00:16,884 --> 00:00:18,451
OFF TO SAVE KOGA.

10
00:00:18,451 --> 00:00:19,384
DURING THAT SHORT TIME, THE

11
00:00:19,384 --> 00:00:21,051
NEWLY REBORN NARAKU CONFRONTS

12
00:00:21,051 --> 00:00:22,051
KIKYO.

13
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:23,551
WHAT IS HIS TRUE OBJECTIVE?

14
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:24,984
>> IT'S UP TO ALL OF US.

15
00:00:24,984 --> 00:00:26,151
>> TRAVEL BACK IN TIME FOR A

16
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:30,718
FEUDAL FAIRY TALE, "INUYASHA."

17
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:27,526
>> ALL RIGHT, HIT 'EM.

18
00:02:27,526 --> 00:02:31,426
>> OH, LOOK, IT'S KOGA.

19
00:02:31,426 --> 00:02:32,726
>> IF YOUR COMRADES ARE SO

20
00:02:32,726 --> 00:02:40,160
PRECIOUS TO YOU...

21
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:40,826
>> WHAT NOW?

22
00:02:40,826 --> 00:02:58,960
>> IT'S BREAKING UP.

23
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:02,026
>> HA HA HA...

24
00:03:02,026 --> 00:03:04,260
KIKYO, I SHOULD BE SEEING YOU

25
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:24,736
SOON.

26
00:03:24,736 --> 00:03:27,403
>> AH.

27
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:28,303
KOGA.

28
00:03:28,303 --> 00:03:31,436
>> DAMN IT.

29
00:03:31,436 --> 00:03:32,703
>> INUYASHA.

30
00:03:32,703 --> 00:03:33,536
KAGOME.

31
00:03:33,536 --> 00:03:34,236
>> WE HAVE TO GET OUT OF HERE

32
00:03:34,236 --> 00:03:36,103
QUICKLY OR NARAKU WILL KILL US.

33
00:03:36,103 --> 00:03:38,170
>> KAGOME, I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL.

34
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,236
BUT THERE'S NOTHING MORE WE CAN

35
00:03:39,236 --> 00:03:40,270
DO FOR KOGA.

36
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:41,436
WE HAVE TO GIVE UP ON SAVING

37
00:03:41,436 --> 00:03:44,203
HIM.

38
00:03:44,203 --> 00:03:45,670
>> AHHH.

39
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,636
>> I'D NEVER PUT YOU IN DANGER.

40
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:48,936
>> KOGA.

41
00:03:48,936 --> 00:03:51,703
KOGA.

42
00:03:51,703 --> 00:03:53,170
OH, KOGA.

43
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:53,970
>> HEY, SHIPPOU.

44
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:55,636
>> YES, WHAT?

45
00:03:55,636 --> 00:03:56,903
>> TAKE KAGOME, AND GET OUT OF

46
00:03:56,903 --> 00:03:57,703
HERE FAST.

47
00:03:57,703 --> 00:03:58,836
CAN YOU MANAGE THAT?

48
00:03:58,836 --> 00:04:00,503
>> UH-HUH.

49
00:04:00,503 --> 00:04:03,203
INUYASHA, AREN'T YOU COMING?

50
00:04:03,203 --> 00:04:04,536
>> TAKE GOOD CARE OF KAGOME,

51
00:04:04,536 --> 00:04:06,670
GREAT DEMON SHIPPOU.

52
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:08,203
>> INUYASHA...

53
00:04:08,203 --> 00:04:10,136
>> WE CAN'T LEAVE YOU.

54
00:04:10,136 --> 00:04:11,103
>> YOU WANT TO SAVE THAT SCRAWNY

55
00:04:11,103 --> 00:04:12,503
WOLF, DON'T YOU?

56
00:04:12,503 --> 00:04:13,670
YOU'LL ONLY BE IN MY WAY IF

57
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:14,836
YOU'RE WITH ME.

58
00:04:14,836 --> 00:04:17,203
NOW GO.

59
00:04:17,203 --> 00:04:19,036
>> TRANSFORM!

60
00:04:19,036 --> 00:04:21,170
KAGOME, CLIMB ON BOARD.

61
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:22,570
>> QUICKLY, KAGOME.

62
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,736
>> THERE'S NO TIME TO LOSE.

63
00:04:23,736 --> 00:04:25,003
>> DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.

64
00:04:25,003 --> 00:04:26,403
I PROMISE TO BRING THAT SCRAWNY

65
00:04:26,403 --> 00:04:28,303
WOLF BACK FOR YOU.

66
00:04:28,303 --> 00:04:29,803
>> HMM.

67
00:04:29,803 --> 00:04:34,336
>> COME ON.

68
00:04:34,336 --> 00:04:35,903
BE CAREFUL, INUYASHA, YOU COME

69
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,236
BACK TO US.

70
00:04:37,236 --> 00:04:38,903
YOU PROMISED, REMEMBER.

71
00:04:38,903 --> 00:04:41,603
>> I WILL.

72
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:50,903
>> OH.

73
00:04:50,903 --> 00:04:55,103
>> IS THIS EVIL PRESENCE NARAKU?

74
00:04:55,103 --> 00:04:56,903
STILL, I SENSE SOMETHING

75
00:04:56,903 --> 00:05:06,003
DIFFERENT IN IT.

76
00:05:06,003 --> 00:05:06,970
>> MOUNT HAKUREI IS

77
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:47,836
DISINTEGRATING.

78
00:05:47,836 --> 00:05:50,503
>> NARAKU.

79
00:05:50,503 --> 00:05:57,370
>> AH, KIKYO, WE MEET AGAIN.

80
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,803
>> AHH.

81
00:06:00,803 --> 00:06:06,703
MIASMA IS HORRIBLE.

82
00:06:06,703 --> 00:06:07,836
IF HE FELL INTO THAT POOL,

83
00:06:07,836 --> 00:06:11,470
THERE'S NO WAY TO SAVE HIM.

84
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:17,303
WHAT THE HELL ARE THOSE THINGS?

85
00:06:17,303 --> 00:06:21,036
>> THERE HE IS.

86
00:06:21,036 --> 00:06:22,070
ARE YOU READY FOR SOME

87
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:26,736
LASER?

88
00:06:26,736 --> 00:06:29,970
AHH.

89
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:32,936
HE'S STARTING TO DISSOLVE.

90
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,336
DAMN NARAKU, HE WAS GOING TO

91
00:06:34,336 --> 00:06:35,603
DEVOUR KOGA ALONG WITH THE

92
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:38,836
SACRED SHARDS IN HIS LEGS.

93
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:42,070
AH.

94
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:43,103
YOU'RE ALIVE, ARE YOU,

95
00:06:43,103 --> 00:06:44,436
YOU SCRAWNY WOLF?

96
00:06:44,436 --> 00:06:46,170
>> YEAH, MANGY MUTT.

97
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:49,470
NARAKU? WHAT HAPPENED TO NARAKU?

98
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:51,203
>> WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT LATER.

99
00:06:51,203 --> 00:06:56,570
FIRST WE GET OUT OF HERE.

100
00:06:56,570 --> 00:06:58,736
>> IT'S NO USE, ALL THE OPENINGS

101
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:00,436
ARE ALREADY SEALED.

102
00:07:00,436 --> 00:07:02,536
ISN'T THERE ANY WAY OUT?

103
00:07:02,536 --> 00:07:03,536
>> IT'S FAR TOO EARLY TO GIVE

104
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,536
UP.

105
00:07:04,536 --> 00:07:05,436
IF THERE'S NO EXIT, WE'LL HAVE

106
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:15,170
TO MAKE ONE.

107
00:07:15,170 --> 00:07:19,836
[GRUNTING]

108
00:07:19,836 --> 00:07:21,703
>> WAY TO GO, MIROKU.

109
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:31,170
>> COME ON.

110
00:07:31,170 --> 00:07:33,436
>> THE MOUNTAIN'S CRUMBLING.

111
00:07:33,436 --> 00:07:34,736
>> WHERE'S INUYASHA?

112
00:07:34,736 --> 00:07:36,303
ANYBODY SEEN HIM YET?

113
00:07:36,303 --> 00:07:37,003
>> MAYBE HE DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT

114
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:38,036
IN TIME.

115
00:07:38,036 --> 00:07:39,136
>> NO, I'M POSITIVE, HE'LL GET

116
00:07:39,136 --> 00:07:40,236
OUT ALIVE.

117
00:07:40,236 --> 00:07:41,570
IT'D TAKE A LOT MORE THAN THIS

118
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,736
TO KILL INUYASHA.

119
00:07:43,736 --> 00:07:45,803
YOU BETTER BE OK, INUYASHA.

120
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:46,870
YOU PROMISED ME YOU'D COME

121
00:07:46,870 --> 00:07:51,036
BACK.

122
00:07:51,036 --> 00:07:53,103
>> THE EXIT, WHERE'S THE EXIT?

123
00:07:53,103 --> 00:07:55,136
>> YOU IDIOT.

124
00:07:55,136 --> 00:07:57,136
DON'T YOU EVEN KNOW THE WAY OUT?

125
00:07:57,136 --> 00:07:58,070
>> I USED TO, BUT ALL THE

126
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,703
EXITS HAVE BEEN SEALED.

127
00:07:59,703 --> 00:08:01,703
>> YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.

128
00:08:01,703 --> 00:08:02,936
I AIN'T GONNA DIE IN THIS PLACE

129
00:08:02,936 --> 00:08:04,236
WITH YOU.

130
00:08:04,236 --> 00:08:05,336
>> WE AGREE FOR ONCE.

131
00:08:05,336 --> 00:08:08,136
JUST WHAT I WAS THINKING.

132
00:08:08,136 --> 00:08:10,203
I'M NOT DYING HERE.

133
00:08:10,203 --> 00:08:11,970
>> HUH?

134
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:14,470
>> THERE IT IS, OUR WAY OUT.

135
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:16,203
HUH?

136
00:08:16,203 --> 00:08:19,436
KIKYO.

137
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:20,703
WHAT'S GOING ON?

138
00:08:20,703 --> 00:08:21,770
WHY SHOULD I HAVE A VISION OF

139
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:29,803
KIKYO AT A TIME LIKE THIS?

140
00:08:29,803 --> 00:08:31,003
>> NARAKU, WHAT IS THE MEANING

141
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:34,536
OF YOUR APPEARANCE?

142
00:08:34,536 --> 00:08:36,503
>> ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

143
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:38,103
THIS IS MY NEW, REJUVENATED

144
00:08:38,103 --> 00:08:39,836
BODY.

145
00:08:39,836 --> 00:08:41,736
>> DON'T MAKE ME LAUGH.

146
00:08:41,736 --> 00:08:43,370
DO YOU THINK MY EYES CAN'T SEE

147
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,736
THE TRUTH?

148
00:08:45,736 --> 00:08:47,603
YOU MAY LOOK FORMIDABLE

149
00:08:47,603 --> 00:08:49,303
BUT SUCH FINERY IS NOTHING BUT A

150
00:08:49,303 --> 00:08:50,370
FAADE.

151
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:52,370
YOU ESCAPED MOUNT HAKUREI AND

152
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:54,103
WENT SO FAR AS TO PUT UP A

153
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:55,836
SACRED BARRIER.

154
00:08:55,836 --> 00:08:58,003
WHAT WERE YOU AFTER?

155
00:08:58,003 --> 00:09:01,103
>> SO YOU NOTICED, DID YOU?

156
00:09:01,103 --> 00:09:03,736
HOW VERY ASTUTE.

157
00:09:03,736 --> 00:09:04,503
>> JUST BEFORE THE MOUNTAIN

158
00:09:04,503 --> 00:09:06,203
COLLAPSED, YOUR INCARNATION,

159
00:09:06,203 --> 00:09:08,903
KAGURA, LEFT MOUNT HAKUREI WITH

160
00:09:08,903 --> 00:09:13,036
SOMETHING IN HER POSSESSION.

161
00:09:13,036 --> 00:09:16,473
TELL ME, WHAT'S YOUR PURPOSE?

162
00:09:36,336 --> 00:09:39,870
>> INUYASHA.

163
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,703
HUH?

164
00:09:42,703 --> 00:09:45,136
I SENSE THEM.

165
00:09:45,136 --> 00:09:47,203
I SENSE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

166
00:09:47,203 --> 00:09:48,203
>> IS IT KOGA?

167
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:51,703
>> THEY'RE COMING THIS WAY.

168
00:09:51,703 --> 00:09:56,570
INUYASHA!

169
00:09:56,570 --> 00:09:57,236
>> HE MADE IT OUT ALIVE.

170
00:09:57,236 --> 00:10:05,336
>> LOOK, THEY'RE BOTH SAFE.

171
00:10:05,336 --> 00:10:10,870
>> NOT AGAIN.

172
00:10:10,870 --> 00:10:11,670
KAGOME!

173
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:14,670
>> WHAT ABOUT KAGOME?

174
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,903
>> WATCH OUT.

175
00:10:17,903 --> 00:10:30,536
>> AHHH.

176
00:10:30,536 --> 00:10:32,936
>> AHHH.

177
00:10:32,936 --> 00:10:33,936
>> INUYASHA.

178
00:10:33,936 --> 00:10:34,903
KOGA.

179
00:10:34,903 --> 00:10:36,203
>> STUPID ME, WHAT WAS I

180
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:39,570
THINKING PUTTING HIM IN CHARGE?

181
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:42,236
I'M SORRY, KAGOME, YOU MUST HAVE

182
00:10:42,236 --> 00:10:44,803
BEEN SCARED WITHOUT ME THERE.

183
00:10:44,803 --> 00:10:46,903
>> YOU INGRATE, DON'T ACT LIKE

184
00:10:46,903 --> 00:10:48,536
YOU GOT OUT ALIVE ALL BY

185
00:10:48,536 --> 00:10:49,436
YOURSELF.

186
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:50,570
>> SHUT YOUR MOUTH, MUTT.

187
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:51,836
>> HE'S RIGHT, KOGA.

188
00:10:51,836 --> 00:10:53,370
YOU SHOULD AT LEAST SAY THANKS

189
00:10:53,370 --> 00:10:54,603
OR SOMETHING.

190
00:10:54,603 --> 00:10:56,103
>> HUH?

191
00:10:56,103 --> 00:10:57,136
>> INUYASHA WENT TO SAVE YOU

192
00:10:57,136 --> 00:11:03,470
LONG BEFORE I EVEN ASKED HIM TO.

193
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,303
>> HMM...

194
00:11:05,303 --> 00:11:07,503
>> HUH, DON'T GET ME WRONG.

195
00:11:07,503 --> 00:11:08,836
I JUST DIDN'T WANT NARAKU TO GET

196
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:10,370
YOUR SCARED JEWEL SHARDS.

197
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,770
THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I WENT

198
00:11:11,770 --> 00:11:12,736
AFTER YOU.

199
00:11:12,736 --> 00:11:13,736
>> OH, YEAH?

200
00:11:13,736 --> 00:11:15,136
THEN I DON'T NEED TO THANK YOU.

201
00:11:15,136 --> 00:11:15,936
>> THAT'S THE LEAST YOU COULD

202
00:11:15,936 --> 00:11:16,803
DO.

203
00:11:16,803 --> 00:11:19,670
>> YOU WANT MY THANKS OR NOT?

204
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:20,836
>> ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

205
00:11:20,836 --> 00:11:29,336
HE WANTS YOU TO THANK HIM.

206
00:11:29,336 --> 00:11:31,203
>> HMM.

207
00:11:31,203 --> 00:11:33,770
I'LL ASK YOU JUST ONE MORE TIME.

208
00:11:33,770 --> 00:11:35,603
NARAKU, TELL ME WHAT YOUR TRUE

209
00:11:35,603 --> 00:11:38,370
PURPOSE HERE IS.

210
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,836
>> I'M SURPRISED.

211
00:11:39,836 --> 00:11:41,736
DID YOU COME ALL THIS WAY AND GO

212
00:11:41,736 --> 00:11:43,103
TO ALL THIS TROUBLE TO ASK ME

213
00:11:43,103 --> 00:11:45,203
SUCH A SIMPLE MATTER?

214
00:11:45,203 --> 00:11:46,336
>> I'M THE ONE WHO'S ASKING THE

215
00:11:46,336 --> 00:11:49,136
QUESTIONS.

216
00:11:49,136 --> 00:11:50,270
>> ROUND AND ROUND GOES THE

217
00:11:50,270 --> 00:11:52,136
SPINNING WHEEL.

218
00:11:52,136 --> 00:11:53,403
SPINNING AND WEAVING A RED

219
00:11:53,403 --> 00:11:55,236
THREAD OF FATE.

220
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:57,670
MEETING RASETSU, OR SHOULD I

221
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:59,736
SAY, KANSUKE, WAS NO

222
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:01,703
COINCIDENCE.

223
00:12:01,703 --> 00:12:08,403
IT WAS ALL ACCORDING TO MY PLAN.

224
00:12:08,403 --> 00:12:09,470
>> YOU MEAN...

225
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:11,236
>> I MERELY TOOK ADVANTAGE OF

226
00:12:11,236 --> 00:12:12,903
HIS DESIRE TO FIND A PLACE TO

227
00:12:12,903 --> 00:12:14,503
DIE.

228
00:12:14,503 --> 00:12:17,203
IT WAS ALL SO SIMPLE.

229
00:12:17,203 --> 00:12:18,836
I PUT RUMORS INTO THAT DYING

230
00:12:18,836 --> 00:12:20,736
MAN'S HEAD ABOUT THE SACRED

231
00:12:20,736 --> 00:12:22,470
GROUNDS OF MOUNT HAKUREI.

232
00:12:22,470 --> 00:12:25,936
AND THUS SET HIM ON YOUR PATH.

233
00:12:25,936 --> 00:12:28,536
NOW DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

234
00:12:28,536 --> 00:12:29,336
HA HA HA.

235
00:12:29,336 --> 00:12:30,670
YOU DID NOT COME HERE OF YOUR

236
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,203
OWN ACCORD.

237
00:12:32,203 --> 00:12:34,970
I LURED YOU HERE.

238
00:12:34,970 --> 00:12:37,536
>> HMM.

239
00:12:37,536 --> 00:12:39,070
>> I HAVE OFTEN HEARD YOU HUMANS

240
00:12:39,070 --> 00:12:40,536
REFER TO THIS AS FATE OR

241
00:12:40,536 --> 00:12:43,936
DESTINY.

242
00:12:43,936 --> 00:12:45,103
>> ONCE THE THREADS OF DESTINY

243
00:12:45,103 --> 00:12:46,836
BECOME TANGLED, THEY CANNOT BE

244
00:12:46,836 --> 00:12:49,770
UNDONE.

245
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:51,370
TO WALK DOWN THIS PATH ONCE

246
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,303
MORE ONLY CONFIRMS MY CURSED

247
00:12:53,303 --> 00:12:58,170
DESTINY.

248
00:12:58,170 --> 00:12:59,503
>> ONLY THE WEAK UTTER SUCH

249
00:12:59,503 --> 00:13:01,436
NONSENSE.

250
00:13:01,436 --> 00:13:03,270
IT IS DIFFERENT FOR THE TRULY

251
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,036
POWERFUL.

252
00:13:04,036 --> 00:13:05,736
THEY CREATE THIS SO-CALLED FATE

253
00:13:05,736 --> 00:13:08,403
OR DESTINY WITH THEIR OWN HANDS.

254
00:13:08,403 --> 00:13:09,936
>> YOU'RE THE ONE SPEAKING

255
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:13,070
NONSENSE, NARAKU.

256
00:13:13,070 --> 00:13:15,170
>> OH, YES, YOU WERE INTERESTED

257
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,703
IN FINDING OUT ABOUT MY TRUE

258
00:13:16,703 --> 00:13:19,536
AIM.

259
00:13:19,536 --> 00:13:22,070
>> HMM.

260
00:13:22,070 --> 00:13:23,736
>> YOU WISH TO KNOW?

261
00:13:23,736 --> 00:13:28,103
THEN I SHALL TELL YOU.

262
00:13:28,103 --> 00:13:30,303
YOU SHALL LEARN MY PURPOSE.

263
00:13:30,303 --> 00:13:32,036
WHAT IT IS I NEED TO ACCOMPLISH

264
00:13:32,036 --> 00:13:33,703
AT MOUNT HAKUREI.

265
00:13:33,703 --> 00:13:35,270
HERE IS YOUR ANSWER.

266
00:13:35,270 --> 00:13:39,970
>> AH.

267
00:13:39,970 --> 00:13:43,336
AHH...

268
00:13:43,336 --> 00:13:44,836
>> YOUR IMITATION BODY IS FORMED

269
00:13:44,836 --> 00:13:47,770
OF BONES AND GRAVEYARD SOIL.

270
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:49,470
YOU DON'T EVEN BLEED.

271
00:13:49,470 --> 00:13:51,136
>> AHH...

272
00:13:51,136 --> 00:13:53,903
I CURSE YOU, NARAKU.

273
00:13:53,903 --> 00:14:01,136
>> YOU UNDERESTIMATED ME, KIKYO.

274
00:14:01,136 --> 00:14:02,603
YOU CAME HERE FEELING SELF-

275
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:05,103
ASSURED, SO CERTAIN THAT I WOULD

276
00:14:05,103 --> 00:14:08,570
NOT BE ABLE TO KILL YOU.

277
00:14:08,570 --> 00:14:10,103
YOU BELIEVED THAT AS LONG AS I

278
00:14:10,103 --> 00:14:11,570
HAVE THE HEART OF THAT WORTHLESS

279
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,170
HUMAN, THAT PATHETIC BANDIT,

280
00:14:14,170 --> 00:14:15,570
ONIGUMO, WHO LOVED YOU WITH ALL

281
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:19,503
HIS BEING...

282
00:14:19,503 --> 00:14:20,470
YOU BELIEVED I WOULDN'T

283
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:22,603
HARM YOU.

284
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:24,003
I FEEL NOTHING, EVEN AFTER

285
00:14:24,003 --> 00:14:25,870
WOUNDING YOU SO.

286
00:14:25,870 --> 00:14:28,670
NO REMORSE, NO SADNESS.

287
00:14:28,670 --> 00:14:30,370
>> DOES THAT MEAN HIS HEART NO

288
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:32,770
LONGER BEATS INSIDE YOU?

289
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:34,170
I SEE.

290
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:35,603
THAT'S WHAT KAGURA HAD IN HER

291
00:14:35,603 --> 00:14:41,536
POSSESSION, HIS HUMAN HEART.

292
00:14:41,536 --> 00:14:43,870
UH...

293
00:14:43,870 --> 00:14:45,036
>> THE BOTTOM OF THIS CREVICE IS

294
00:14:45,036 --> 00:14:48,903
FILLED WITH MY MIASMA.

295
00:14:48,903 --> 00:14:50,403
AN IMITATION BODY LIKE YOURS

296
00:14:50,403 --> 00:14:51,836
WILL DISSOLVE EASILY IN A MATTER

297
00:14:51,836 --> 00:14:56,370
OF SECONDS.

298
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:59,103
>> MMM.

299
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,770
>> KIKYO, THIS WILL BE YOUR

300
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,770
BURIAL GROUND.

301
00:15:04,770 --> 00:15:06,670
>> NO, WHY ARE THESE MEMORIES

302
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:14,603
COMING BACK TO ME NOW?

303
00:15:14,603 --> 00:15:20,470
>> AHH.

304
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,803
>> AH.

305
00:15:22,803 --> 00:15:45,336
AHH...

INUYASHA.

307
00:15:46,803 --> 00:15:47,703

>> INUYASHA?

309
00:15:48,936 --> 00:15:50,270
>> I DON'T LIKE THIS.

310
00:15:50,270 --> 00:15:51,236
I'VE GOT A BAD FEELING ABOUT

311
00:15:51,236 --> 00:15:52,836
SOMETHING.

312
00:15:52,836 --> 00:16:03,070
>> INUYASHA?

313
00:16:03,070 --> 00:16:04,103
>> NOW, DO YOU UNDERSTAND,

314
00:16:04,103 --> 00:16:05,370
KIKYO?

315
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:07,084
AT LAST THE NEW BODY I HAVE

316
00:16:07,084 --> 00:16:13,617
DESIRED FOR SO LONG IS MINE.

317
00:16:13,617 --> 00:16:14,884
>> I MUST SAY, YOU TOOK

318
00:16:14,884 --> 00:16:16,084
EXTRAORDINARY STEPS TO KILL A

319
00:16:16,084 --> 00:16:24,117
MERE WOMAN, NARAKU.

320
00:16:24,117 --> 00:16:27,517
>> SESSHOUMARU.

321
00:16:27,517 --> 00:16:28,984
>> HE SHOWS LORD SESSHOUMARU

322
00:16:28,984 --> 00:16:30,851
SUCH A LACK OF RESPECT.

323
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:33,917
HE'S GROWN TOO FULL OF HIMSELF.

324
00:16:33,917 --> 00:16:35,684
>> JAKEN, LISTEN TO ME.

325
00:16:35,684 --> 00:16:36,884
STAY WELL BACK.

326
00:16:36,884 --> 00:16:40,417
>> HUH?

327
00:16:40,417 --> 00:16:41,684
>> I NEVER EXPECTED YOU TO BE

328
00:16:41,684 --> 00:16:43,017
FOLLOWING ME AS WELL,

329
00:16:43,017 --> 00:16:44,617
SESSHOUMARU.

330
00:16:44,617 --> 00:16:46,084
SO YOU FIND ME THAT INTERESTING,

331
00:16:46,084 --> 00:16:47,717
DO YOU?

332
00:16:47,717 --> 00:16:48,651
>> SILENCE.

333

MEDDLING IN OUR AFFAIRS.

335
00:16:50,951 --> 00:16:51,784

337
00:16:52,851 --> 00:16:55,451
>> HUH?

338
00:16:55,451 --> 00:16:56,417
>> SINCE YOU'VE EMERGED FROM

339
00:16:56,417 --> 00:16:58,151
YOUR BARRIER, I ASSUME YOU'RE

340
00:16:58,151 --> 00:16:59,517
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A

341
00:16:59,517 --> 00:17:06,284
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF POWER.

342
00:17:06,284 --> 00:17:07,351
>> WHY DON'T YOU SEE FOR

343
00:17:07,351 --> 00:17:17,884
YOURSELF?

344
00:17:17,884 --> 00:17:23,851
>> HMM.

345
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:24,517
>> GOT HIM!

346
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:29,751
>> HA HA HA!

347
00:17:29,751 --> 00:17:33,517
>> HE'S LAUGHING?

348
00:17:33,517 --> 00:17:35,317
>> SESSHOUMARU, I SHALL NOW

349
00:17:35,317 --> 00:17:37,017
REVERSE THE POWER OF YOUR SWORD

350
00:17:37,017 --> 00:17:42,984
AND FIRE IT BACK AT YOU.

351
00:17:42,984 --> 00:17:44,417
>> AAH!

352
00:17:44,417 --> 00:17:46,984
LORD SESSHOUMARU IS BEING PUSHED

353
00:17:46,984 --> 00:17:57,084
BACK.

354
00:17:57,084 --> 00:17:58,251
>> HUH.

355
00:17:58,251 --> 00:17:59,584
IT'S USELESS.

356
00:17:59,584 --> 00:18:01,817
I WILL NEVER DIE.

357
00:18:01,817 --> 00:18:18,884
HA HA HA HA...

358
00:18:18,884 --> 00:18:20,817
>> SUCH IMPUDENCE.

359
00:18:20,817 --> 00:18:21,884
YOU MERELY WISH TO TEST THE

360
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,517
POWER OF YOUR NEW BODY AGAINST

361
00:18:23,517 --> 00:18:31,551
ME.

362
00:18:31,551 --> 00:18:33,417
>> SESSHOUMARU.

363
00:18:33,417 --> 00:18:34,717
>> INUYASHA, STILL ALIVE, ARE

364
00:18:34,717 --> 00:18:35,517
YOU?

365
00:18:35,517 --> 00:18:37,417
>> WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

366
00:18:37,417 --> 00:18:38,784
>> IT SEEMS THAT NARAKU'S MAIN

367
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,084
INTEREST WAS NOT YOU.

368
00:18:41,084 --> 00:18:42,317
BUT RATHER HIS REAL OBJECTIVE

369
00:18:42,317 --> 00:18:44,451
WAS TO KILL THAT WOMAN.

370
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:49,417
>> HUH?

371
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,617
KIKYO'S BOW.

372
00:18:51,617 --> 00:19:05,584
NO, KIKYO.

373
00:19:05,584 --> 00:19:06,851
WHAT HAPPENED?

374
00:19:06,851 --> 00:19:09,917
DID NARAKU KILL KIKYO?

375
00:19:09,917 --> 00:19:13,417
NO, IT CAN'T BE!

376
00:19:13,417 --> 00:19:15,584
>> NARAKU CANNOT KILL ME.

377
00:19:15,584 --> 00:19:17,317
NOT AS LONG AS HE HAS ONIGUMO'S

378
00:19:17,317 --> 00:19:19,284
HEART, A HEART WHICH CARES FOR

379
00:19:19,284 --> 00:19:35,817
ME.

380
00:19:35,817 --> 00:19:50,084
>> SOUL COLLECTORS.

381
00:19:50,084 --> 00:19:52,717
I FAILED YOU AGAIN, KIKYO.

382
00:19:52,717 --> 00:19:54,917
I LET YOU DIE.

383
00:19:54,917 --> 00:19:56,184
I WASN'T THERE FOR YOU WHEN YOU

384
00:19:56,184 --> 00:19:58,817
DIED ALONE.

385
00:19:58,817 --> 00:20:00,851
>> THIS MIASMA IS TERRIBLE.

386
00:20:00,851 --> 00:20:02,651
THERE'S NO WAY SHE COULD SURVIVE

387
00:20:02,651 --> 00:20:04,384
IT.

388
00:20:04,384 --> 00:20:05,617
UGH!

389
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:06,384
HUH!

390
00:20:06,384 --> 00:20:08,551
LORD SESSHOUMARU.

391
00:20:08,551 --> 00:20:13,217
>> HOLD ON, SESSHOUMARU.

392
00:20:13,217 --> 00:20:14,217
>> DID YOU JUST WATCH HER GET

393
00:20:14,217 --> 00:20:15,717
KILLED?

394
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:20,717
DIDN'T YOU DO ANYTHING TO HELP?

395
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:23,251
I TOLD YOU TO STOP.

396
00:20:23,251 --> 00:20:24,284
>> I DON'T CARE TO KNOW WHAT

397
00:20:24,284 --> 00:20:25,417
YOUR CONNECTION TO THAT WOMAN

398
00:20:25,417 --> 00:20:29,184
WAS.

399
00:20:29,184 --> 00:20:30,284
THE PERSON RESPONSIBLE FOR

400
00:20:30,284 --> 00:20:32,751
KILLING KIKYO WAS NARAKU...

401
00:20:32,751 --> 00:20:35,351
AND YOU.

402
00:20:35,351 --> 00:20:36,617
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO

403
00:20:36,617 --> 00:20:37,917
DIDN'T SAVE HER.

404
00:20:37,917 --> 00:20:42,384
INUYASHA, BLAME YOURSELF.

405
00:20:42,384 --> 00:20:44,117
RATHER THAN TAKE YOUR ANGER OUT

406
00:20:44,117 --> 00:20:46,051
ON ME, I SUGGEST YOU GO AFTER

407
00:20:46,051 --> 00:20:47,351
NARAKU.

408
00:20:47,351 --> 00:21:02,251
>> EXACTLY.

409
00:21:02,251 --> 00:21:08,317
>> KIKYO, FORGIVE ME.

410
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:15,651
>> INUYASHA.

411
00:21:15,651 --> 00:21:21,317
>> INUYASHA.

412
00:21:21,317 --> 00:21:22,451
AH!

413
00:21:22,451 --> 00:21:26,384
THAT'S--WHERE'S KIKYO?

414
00:21:26,384 --> 00:21:28,251
DID SOMETHING HAPPEN TO HER?

415
00:21:28,251 --> 00:21:32,984
>> YEAH.

416
00:21:32,984 --> 00:21:35,651
NARAKU WASN'T AFTER ME.

417
00:21:35,651 --> 00:21:38,451
HE WANTED KIKYO.

418
00:21:38,451 --> 00:21:45,117
HE WANTED TO TAKE HER LIFE.

419
00:21:45,117 --> 00:21:46,751
>> IT CAN'T BE.

420
00:21:46,751 --> 00:21:57,951
KIKYO IS GONE?

421
00:21:57,951 --> 00:21:59,851
>> DAMN THAT NARAKU.

422
00:21:59,851 --> 00:22:00,951
MAKING ME TAKE CARE OF THIS

423
00:22:00,951 --> 00:22:02,951
THING.

424
00:22:02,951 --> 00:22:04,784
>> KIKYO IS DEAD.

425
00:22:04,784 --> 00:22:07,284
>> HUH, WHAT DID YOU SAY?

426
00:22:07,284 --> 00:22:08,717
>> KIKYO IS DEAD

427
00:22:08,717 --> 00:22:12,431
AND NARAKU KILLED HER.

428
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:58,523
>> DAMN, I'M SICK OF THIS.

429
00:23:58,523 --> 00:23:59,523
WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO BABY-SIT

430
00:23:59,523 --> 00:24:00,890
THIS KID?

431
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:02,690
>> KAGURA, IS KIKYO STILL ALIVE

432
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:04,190
OR IS THAT A LIE?

433
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:05,323
>> INUYASHA WON'T COME.

434
00:24:05,323 --> 00:24:07,656
HE'S BUSY LOOKING FOR KIKYO.

435
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:08,856
>> IS THAT BABY AN INCARNATION

436
00:24:08,856 --> 00:24:10,290
OF NARAKU?

437
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:11,790
WHAT DOES HE WANT WITH ME?

438
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,823
>> YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN

439
00:24:12,823 --> 00:24:14,823
SEE THE SACRED JEWEL SHARDS.

440
00:24:14,823 --> 00:24:17,690
KAGOME, I WANT YOUR EYES.

441
00:24:17,690 --> 00:24:18,823
>> NEXT TIME, THE DARKNESS IN

442
00:24:18,823 --> 00:24:20,556
KAGOME'S HEART.

443
00:24:20,556 --> 00:24:22,390
>> INUYASHA WILL NOT COME TO

444
00:24:22,390 --> 00:24:24,390
SAVE YOU.
