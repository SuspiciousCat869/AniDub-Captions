00:20:28,535 --> 00:20:31,168
KILL EACH OTHER
AND COMBINE TO A NEW ONE.

322
00:20:31,201 --> 00:20:33,568
- THE MOUNTAIN MIST LURED YOU.

323
00:20:33,601 --> 00:20:37,935
YOU TOOK THE BAIT,
AND I CAST MY SPELL.

324
00:20:37,968 --> 00:20:38,835
[CHUCKLES]

325
00:20:38,868 --> 00:20:41,701
YOU COULD HAVE JOINED ME
IN HERE, INUYASHA,

326
00:20:41,735 --> 00:20:44,235
IF ONLY YOU HAD THE COURAGE.

327
00:20:44,268 --> 00:20:47,735
SO THIS IS THE WOMAN
WHO RESTORED ME TO LIFE.

328
00:20:47,768 --> 00:20:52,801
I MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD THIS NEW
BODY AT ALL IF NOT FOR HER.

329
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:55,368
- YEAH, RIGHT, LOSER!

330
00:20:55,401 --> 00:20:57,201
SHE DID IT TO SAVE
INUYASHA, NOT YOU,

331
00:20:57,235 --> 00:21:00,301
SO WIPE THAT STUPID
SMILE OFF YOUR FACE!

332
00:21:00,335 --> 00:21:04,101
- AND YET I STILL KNOW HER
TO BE THE FOOLISH WOMAN

333
00:21:04,135 --> 00:21:08,068
WHO FOLLOWED YOU
IN DEATH 50 YEARS AGO.

334
00:21:09,268 --> 00:21:12,201
- NO! DON'T YOU DARE!

335
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:16,201
DON'T YOU TOUCH HER!
NOT NOW OR EVER!

336
00:21:16,235 --> 00:21:17,501
AAH!

337
00:21:17,535 --> 00:21:20,068
AAH! AAH!

[COUGHING]

339
00:21:24,501 --> 00:21:25,701
- INUYASHA!

340
00:21:25,735 --> 00:21:30,568
- HOW DARE HE?
HOW DARE HE!

341
00:21:35,968 --> 00:21:37,601
- NO. IT MAKES NO SENSE.

342
00:21:37,635 --> 00:21:42,001
- IF HER TRUE WISH
WAS TO SAVE INUYASHA
AND NOT BREAK THE SPELL,

343
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:46,168
WHY DO THE ONE THING
SHE OUGHT NOT TO HAVE DONE?

344
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:50,168
BUT SHE DID.

345
00:21:50,201 --> 00:21:55,201
KIKYO AS GOOD AS GAVE ME
THIS BODY HERSELF.

[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

347
00:23:38,412 --> 00:23:40,378
- SO NARAKU HAS A NEW BODY.

348
00:23:40,412 --> 00:23:42,178
DON'T THINK
WE'RE HAPPY ABOUT IT.

349
00:23:42,212 --> 00:23:45,278
WE'RE ACTUALLY KIND OF WORRIED.

350
00:23:45,312 --> 00:23:47,245
INUYASHA'S GOT KIKYO,

351
00:23:47,278 --> 00:23:49,345
MIROKU, HIS WIND TUNNEL,

352
00:23:49,378 --> 00:23:52,078
AND SANGO HAS KOHAKU.

353
00:23:52,378 --> 00:23:54,478
YOU WILL SAVE US,
WON'T YOU, KIKYO?

354
00:23:54,512 --> 00:23:57,212
YOU KNOW THOSE ARE
OUR JEWEL SHARDS, RIGHT?

355
00:23:57,245 --> 00:23:59,678
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO?

356
00:24:00,112 --> 00:24:03,145
NEXT TIME,
"KIKYO CAPTURED BY NARAKU."

SEE YOU SOON!
