NARAKU KNOW ABOUT THIS?

167
00:08:04,793 --> 00:08:06,593
- HE DOESN'T.

168
00:08:06,626 --> 00:08:08,093
HE'S GONE.

169
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:09,059
- HMM.

170
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:09,893
THAT'S RIGHT.

171
00:08:09,926 --> 00:08:13,793
NARAKU DISAPPEARS
ONCE IN A WHILE.

172
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:15,359
- KAGURA?

173
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:18,693
- I'LL GO AND KILL HIM.

174
00:08:18,726 --> 00:08:22,059
THERE'S NO NEED TO WAIT
FOR NARAKU'S ORDERS.

175
00:08:22,093 --> 00:08:24,326
- YOU'D BETTER NOT, KAGURA.

176
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,359
- HMM.

177
00:08:25,393 --> 00:08:28,893
I DESPISE NARAKU'S METHOD
OF STOOPING TO TRICKERY.

178
00:08:28,926 --> 00:08:31,393
I'LL KILL FOR JEWEL SHARDS.

179
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:32,959
I NEED NO SCHEMES.

180
00:08:32,993 --> 00:08:35,326
- IT'S IN NARAKU'S HANDS--

181
00:08:35,359 --> 00:08:37,993
BOTH LIFE AND DEATH.

182
00:08:38,026 --> 00:08:38,926
- HMM?

183
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:42,959
- WE ARE ALL MERELY
NARAKU'S TOOLS.

184
00:08:44,426 --> 00:08:47,026
- I COULD CARE LESS.

185
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,193
HE'S NOT HERE NOW.

186
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,793
- [GROWLING]

187
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:56,193
- THIS IS A STRANGE FOG.

188
00:08:56,226 --> 00:08:58,793
- I CAN'T SEE A THING.

189
00:08:58,826 --> 00:08:59,626
- DAMN!

190
00:08:59,659 --> 00:09:02,693
- THE SMELL IS STRONGEST
RIGHT HERE.

191
00:09:02,726 --> 00:09:05,693
THE CASTLE HAS TO BE CLOSE BY.

192
00:09:05,726 --> 00:09:06,526
- HUH!

193
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,759
KOGA, UP THERE!

194
00:09:07,793 --> 00:09:09,259
- HMM?

195
00:09:13,493 --> 00:09:16,993
SKELETONS WITH SWORDS?

196
00:09:17,026 --> 00:09:18,459
AAH!

197
00:09:19,359 --> 00:09:20,893
- UNH!
- HMM?

198
00:09:20,926 --> 00:09:22,159
- HELLO.

199
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:24,526
IT'S BEEN TOO LONG, KOGA.

200
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:26,693
- NOT YOU AGAIN.

201
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:31,093
- WHAT'S WITH THOSE SKELETONS?

202
00:09:32,759 --> 00:09:34,893
- THEY ARE THE GUARDS
OF THE CASTLE.

203
00:09:34,926 --> 00:09:36,526
THEY'RE COUNTLESS IN NUMBERS.

204
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:38,193
- WIND SORCERESS KAGURA.

205
00:09:38,226 --> 00:09:41,293
I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN
YOUR DESPICABLE FACE--

206
00:09:41,326 --> 00:09:42,959
NOT FOR ONE MINUTE.

207
00:09:42,993 --> 00:09:44,026
HOW COULD I?

208
00:09:44,059 --> 00:09:47,159
YOU'RE THE ONE
WHO KILLED MY COMRADES.

209
00:09:47,193 --> 00:09:48,659
PREPARE TO DIE!

210
00:09:48,693 --> 00:09:51,593
IT'S PAYBACK TIME
FOR ALL YOU DID!

211
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:52,759
- I MISSED YOU, TOO.

212
00:09:52,793 --> 00:09:55,459
I WAS SO CLOSE TO GETTING YOUR
SACRED JEWEL SHARDS BEFORE.

213
00:09:55,493 --> 00:09:58,026
I'LL GET THEM
THIS TIME FOR SURE!

214
00:09:58,059 --> 00:09:58,793
HMM.

215
00:09:58,826 --> 00:10:01,059
IT WILL BE EASY
TO SLOW HIM DOWN.

216
00:10:01,093 --> 00:10:02,659
I'LL MAKE HIM DANCE FOR ME.

217
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,859

UNH!

00:10:15,859 --> 00:10:18,026
- DANCE OF BLADES!

00:10:18,059 --> 00:10:19,626
- NOT THIS TIME.

[GRUNTING]

00:10:24,059 --> 00:10:25,326
SURPRISE!

227
00:10:25,359 --> 00:10:26,826
- HMM.

228
00:10:27,993 --> 00:10:29,059
- GOT HER.

229
00:10:29,093 --> 00:10:29,993
HUH?

230
00:10:30,026 --> 00:10:30,926
- FOOL!

231
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,959
I'LL CRIPPLE YOU!

232
00:10:34,759 --> 00:10:38,026
DANCE OF THE DRAGON!

233
00:10:44,293 --> 00:10:45,093
- NOW WHAT?

234
00:10:45,126 --> 00:10:47,526
- A WHIRLWIND OF BONES,
THAT'S WHAT!

235
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:49,393
- HRRM!

236
00:10:49,426 --> 00:10:51,059
HRRM!

00:10:51,093 --> 00:10:52,459

- [GRUNTING]

240
00:10:57,926 --> 00:11:00,859
- YOU CAN CHOOSE
YOUR OWN FATE, KOGA.

241
00:11:00,893 --> 00:11:03,859
YOU CAN LET THE SKELETONS
IN THE WHIRLWIND

242
00:11:03,893 --> 00:11:04,893
SLICE YOU TO PIECES,

243
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:07,959
OR YOU CAN LEAP OUT
AND BE SLAIN BY ME.

244
00:11:07,993 --> 00:11:10,726
EITHER WAY, SUITS ME FINE.

245
00:11:10,759 --> 00:11:11,759
- KOGA'S STRONG,

246
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,226
BUT HE DOESN'T STAND A CHANCE
AGAINST THAT THING.

247
00:11:14,259 --> 00:11:15,626
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO NOW?

248
00:11:15,659 --> 00:11:19,059
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE WE'RE
STRONG ENOUGH TO HELP.

- LOOK AT THAT WENCH.

00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:27,593
I THINK SHE'S COMPLETELY
ENJOYING THIS.

253
00:11:27,626 --> 00:11:29,659
- IF WE COULD GET THAT
POWERFUL FAN OF HERS,

254
00:11:29,693 --> 00:11:32,526
MAYBE WE'D HAVE A CHANCE
OF RESCUING KOGA.

255
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:33,859
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT!

256
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:36,493
GET UP CLOSE AND SNATCH
IT FROM HER.

257
00:11:36,526 --> 00:11:37,293
- WHO?

258
00:11:37,326 --> 00:11:38,226
- YOU, OF COURSE.

259
00:11:38,259 --> 00:11:39,359
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

260
00:11:39,393 --> 00:11:41,259
SHE'LL NOTICE ME
BEFORE I GET CLOSE,

261
00:11:41,293 --> 00:11:42,359
AND I'LL BE HACKED TO BITS.

262
00:11:42,393 --> 00:11:46,759
- THEN HOW ARE WE GOING TO
FIGHT KAGURA AND THAT WIND?

263
00:11:46,793 --> 00:11:47,659
HMM?

264
00:11:47,693 --> 00:11:48,893
WAIT A MINUTE.

265
00:11:48,926 --> 00:11:49,993
YES, THE WIND!

266
00:11:50,026 --> 00:11:50,793
THERE IS A WAY!

267
00:11:50,826 --> 00:11:54,059
- ITA, STOP ACTING FOOLISH!

268
00:11:56,526 --> 00:11:57,859
- KOGA'S ACTIONS ARE PROOF

269
00:11:57,893 --> 00:12:01,926
THAT NARAKU'S BARRIER
HAS BECOME WEAKER.

270
00:12:02,893 --> 00:12:04,859
- I THINK THAT WE
SHOULD AT LEAST VERIFY

271
00:12:04,893 --> 00:12:06,826
THE EXACT LOCATION
OF THE CASTLE.

272
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:09,959
- WE CAN'T TAKE INUYASHA
IN THE STATE HE'S IN.

273
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:13,193
- WE WON'T, BECAUSE MIROKU
AND I CAN GO ALONE.

274
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:16,793
- AND IF INUYASHA OBJECTS
TO US LEAVING HIM BEHIND,

275
00:12:16,826 --> 00:12:18,593
WE'LL HAVE KAGOME MAKE HIM SIT.

276
00:12:18,626 --> 00:12:20,859
THEN WE CAN SIMPLY
KNOCK HIM OUT.

277
00:12:20,893 --> 00:12:23,393
- OH, NOT THAT METHOD AGAIN.

278
00:12:23,426 --> 00:12:26,493
- I KEEP TELLING YOU...

279
00:12:26,526 --> 00:12:28,293
KOGA LIKES TO BE COMPLIMENTED,

280
00:12:28,326 --> 00:12:30,426
SO I JUST THOUGHT
IF I FLATTERED HIM,

281
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:32,926
I COULD DISTRACT HIM
FROM BECOMING CURIOUS

282
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,126
ABOUT HOW YOU SMELLED.

283
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:36,759
- STILL, YOUR EYES WERE
ALL SPARKLY AND STUFF.

284
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:41,393
YOU KNOW, YOU GET TOO FRIENDLY
WITH THAT WILD ANIMAL, KAGOME.

285
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,193
- I DON'T DO THAT.

286
00:12:43,226 --> 00:12:44,159
- YEAH, YOU DO.

287
00:12:44,193 --> 00:12:45,193
- DON'T YOU START!

288
00:12:45,226 --> 00:12:47,459
- I'M NOT STARTING ANYTHING!

289
00:12:47,493 --> 00:12:48,826
- INUYASHA!

290
00:12:48,859 --> 00:12:49,626
- HUH?

291
00:12:49,659 --> 00:12:50,993
I KNOW THAT VOICE.

292
00:12:51,026 --> 00:12:52,926
- KAGOME!

293
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:53,759
- OH, NO.

294
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,093
THEY'RE KOGA'S FRIENDS!

295
00:12:55,126 --> 00:12:56,693
INUYASHA, HIDE.

296
00:12:56,726 --> 00:12:58,159
- HUH?

297
00:12:58,193 --> 00:12:58,959
- HMM?

298
00:12:58,993 --> 00:13:00,493
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

299
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:01,393
- UNH!

300
00:13:01,426 --> 00:13:03,759
- THE WOLF DEMON TRIBE
HAS COME BACK AGAIN.

301
00:13:03,793 --> 00:13:04,593
- HUH?

302
00:13:04,626 --> 00:13:06,326
WE CAN'T LET THEM SEE HIM.

303
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,426
- KAGOME!

304
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:08,126
KAGOME!

305
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:11,026
QUICKLY! WE NEED YOUR HELP!

306
00:13:11,993 --> 00:13:12,826
- WHAT?

307
00:13:12,859 --> 00:13:14,259
KOGA AND KAGURA ARE
FIGHTING EACH OTHER?

308
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:17,793
- YES, AND THINGS DON'T LOOK
TOO GOOD FOR KOGA RIGHT NOW.

309
00:13:17,826 --> 00:13:20,759
- INUYASHA, YOU MUSTN'T
SHOW YOURSELF.

310
00:13:20,793 --> 00:13:21,593
- HUH.

311
00:13:21,626 --> 00:13:23,526
YOU DON'T NEED
TO WORRY ABOUT THAT.

312
00:13:23,559 --> 00:13:26,593
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
I'M GOING TO HELP KOGA.

313
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:27,793
IF KAGURA'S SHOWN UP,

314
00:13:27,826 --> 00:13:31,693
THAT MEANS NARAKU'S
CASTLE IS NEARBY.

315
00:13:32,826 --> 00:13:34,759
STILL, NARAKU HAD
PUT UP A BARRIER

316
00:13:34,793 --> 00:13:37,093
TO STOP US FROM GETTING CLOSE.

317
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:39,826
I DON'T LIKE THE LOOKS OF THIS.

318
00:13:39,859 --> 00:13:42,726

GO CHECK THIS OUT.

- SANGO?

320
00:13:43,859 --> 00:13:46,293
- INUYASHA, YOU'RE GOING
TO STAY HERE WITH KAGOME, OK?

321
00:13:46,326 --> 00:13:49,693
YOU WANT TO KEEP YOUR MORTAL
STATE A SECRET, DON'T YOU?

322
00:13:49,726 --> 00:13:50,459
- HUH.

323
00:13:50,493 --> 00:13:52,159
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.

324
00:13:52,193 --> 00:13:53,693
- HUH?

325
00:13:53,726 --> 00:13:54,593
AAH!

326

[GRUNTING]

327
00:13:56,359 --> 00:13:58,126
- OH, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

328
00:13:58,159 --> 00:13:59,293
- WHAT AN IDIOT.

00:13:59,326 --> 00:14:00,159
