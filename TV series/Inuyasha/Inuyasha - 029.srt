00:17:44,094 --> 00:17:46,194
- [SIGHS]

310
00:17:51,294 --> 00:17:52,528
- HUH?
- IT'S SANGO.

311
00:17:52,561 --> 00:17:55,761
SANGO, WAS THAT BOY
YOU WERE CHASING
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER?

312
00:17:55,794 --> 00:17:57,861
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO TALK WITH HIM?

313
00:17:57,894 --> 00:18:00,528
- THAT BOY WAS NOT MY BROTHER!

314
00:18:00,561 --> 00:18:02,528
- SORRY, SANGO.

315
00:18:02,561 --> 00:18:05,761
- WELL, THE MAIN THING IS,
YOU'VE RETURNED UNHARMED.

316
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:09,394
SANGO, THIS WHOLE INCIDENT
WITH THE TRAPS AND BARRIER--

317
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:12,461
TELL ME, WAS IT NARAKU
WHO WAS BEHIND IT ALL?

318
00:18:12,494 --> 00:18:13,494
- MM-HMM.
- I SEE.

319
00:18:13,528 --> 00:18:15,728
THEN YOU MUST BE EXHAUSTED
FROM THE ENCOUNTER.

320
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:19,028
LET'S RETURN TO THE VILLAGE
AND GET SOME REST, OK?

321
00:18:19,061 --> 00:18:20,494
- WAIT, MIROKU.

322
00:18:20,528 --> 00:18:23,128
I BEG YOU,
PLEASE PERFORM A SERVICE

323
00:18:23,161 --> 00:18:27,528
TO HONOR AND COMMEMORATE
THE DEAD.

324
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:29,528
- HMM.

325
00:18:31,994 --> 00:18:34,894
- THAT'S THE LAST ONE.
YOU'RE AMAZING KIRARA.

326
00:18:34,928 --> 00:18:37,061
GROWING UP IN THE SLAYERS'
VILLAGE PAID OFF.

327
00:18:37,094 --> 00:18:40,028
YOU MANAGED TO SNIFF OUT
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THE TRAPS.

328
00:18:40,061 --> 00:18:43,628
WE'LL GET SANGO TO SAFELY
DESTROY THESE SOMEWHERE LATER.

329
00:18:43,661 --> 00:18:48,228
NOW THEN, I'LL GO TELL EVERYBODY
ABOUT WHAT YOU MANAGED TO DO.

330
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:52,594
HUH? HEY, KIRARA,
WHERE DID YOU GO?

331
00:18:52,628 --> 00:18:56,494
KIRARA? KIRARA?

332
00:18:56,528 --> 00:18:58,628
- SO WHAT DO YOU MAKE
OF IT ALL, MIROKU?

333
00:18:58,661 --> 00:18:59,394
- WHAT'S THAT?

334
00:18:59,428 --> 00:19:01,028
- ABOUT HER MEETING UP
WITH NARAKU.

335
00:19:01,061 --> 00:19:03,694
I WONDER WHAT SANGO AND NARAKU
ENDED UP TALKING ABOUT.

336
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:07,261
- HE PROBABLY TOLD SANGO
THAT HE WAS MANIPULATING
HER BROTHER LIKE A PUPPET.

337
00:19:07,294 --> 00:19:11,128
- HE TRIED TO GET SANGO
TO FIGHT KOHAKU!

338
00:19:11,161 --> 00:19:13,061
NARAKU IS UNFORGIVABLY CRUEL!

339
00:19:13,094 --> 00:19:15,361
- SANGO CAN'T SLAY
HER OWN BROTHER.

340
00:19:15,394 --> 00:19:16,928
LET'S LEAVE HER ALONE
FOR A WHILE,

341
00:19:16,961 --> 00:19:19,061
LEAVE HER WITH HER THOUGHTS
UNTIL SHE'S READY

342
00:19:19,094 --> 00:19:21,894
TO TALK TO US ABOUT IT.

343
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,794
- WELL, YOU CAN'T JUST
LET HIM OFF THE HOOK.

344
00:19:24,828 --> 00:19:27,928
SO WHAT IF HE'S NARAKU'S PUPPET
WITH A JEWEL SHARD IN HIS BACK?

345
00:19:27,961 --> 00:19:31,161
KOHAKU'S RESPONSIBLE
FOR SLAUGHTERING AN ENTIRE TOWN.

346
00:19:31,194 --> 00:19:35,061
IF SANGO CAN'T KILL HIM,
THEN I'M GONNA HAVE TO
TAKE HIM DOWN.

347
00:19:35,094 --> 00:19:38,661
HEY, SANGO, YOU GOT
A PROBLEM WITH THAT?

348
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:43,494
- UH, INUYASHA, I CAN'T BELIEVE

349
00:19:43,528 --> 00:19:47,461
HOW UTTERLY INSENSITIVE
YOU CAN BE.

350
00:19:47,494 --> 00:19:48,928
SANGO, WAIT UP!

351
00:19:48,961 --> 00:19:52,994
- DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO ABOUT HIM.

352
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,561
DO WE KILL HIM?

353
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:55,694
- OF COURSE!

354
00:19:55,728 --> 00:19:56,861
- NO MATTER WHAT?

355
00:19:56,894 --> 00:19:57,894
- YEAH. THINK ABOUT IT.

356
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:00,061
NARAKU SENT SANGO'S
ZOMBIE-SHARD-PUPPET BROTHER

357
00:20:00,094 --> 00:20:03,094
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT
WE'D BE TOO SENTIMENTAL
AND TOO WIMPY ABOUT IT

358
00:20:03,128 --> 00:20:05,328
TO KILL HIM OFF,
AND THERE'S NO WAY

359
00:20:05,361 --> 00:20:07,028
I'M GONNA FALL FOR THAT!

360
00:20:07,061 --> 00:20:11,528
- HMM. I CAN SEE YOU'RE
REALLY TORN UP ABOUT IT.

361
00:20:11,561 --> 00:20:14,861
- SHUT UP, MIROKU! GET LOST!

362
00:20:14,894 --> 00:20:19,828
I'M IN A LOUSY POSITION.
NOBODY ELSE WILL TAKE
CARE OF THIS EXCEPT ME,

363
00:20:19,861 --> 00:20:22,994
BUT I FEEL BAD FOR SANGO.

364
00:20:28,728 --> 00:20:29,961
- UNH!

365
00:20:29,994 --> 00:20:32,394
DID IT! UNH!

366
00:20:32,428 --> 00:20:36,461
- KOHAKU, YOU'RE NOT
TRYING HARD ENOUGH.

367
00:20:38,428 --> 00:20:43,094
- HUH? HEY, KIRARA.
COME ON NOW. CUT THAT OUT.

368
00:20:43,128 --> 00:20:44,228
- HOW'S THE WOUND?

369
00:20:44,261 --> 00:20:46,328
- HEY, SANGO.
- ROUGH TRAINING.

370
00:20:46,361 --> 00:20:49,761
- ROUGH FOR ME, THAT IS.
I HAVE SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO.

371
00:20:49,794 --> 00:20:51,594
- FATHER TOLD ME HE'S
BEEN WATCHING YOU,

372
00:20:51,628 --> 00:20:55,028
AND HE THINKS YOU'RE GETTING
BETTER EVERY DAY, KOHAKU.

373
00:20:55,061 --> 00:20:56,294
- REALLY?
- REALLY.

374
00:20:56,328 --> 00:20:59,994
- THAT'S THE FIRST TIME
I'VE EVER HEARD
OF FATHER PRAISING ME.

375
00:21:00,028 --> 00:21:05,161
HA HA! MAKES ME FEEL
KIND OF EMBARRASSED.

376
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:09,528
HA HA HA!

377
00:21:09,561 --> 00:21:11,028
- I MADE HIM FORGET.

378
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:15,628
I ERASED ALL THE MEMORIES
OF HIS LIFE.

379
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:22,494
- KOHAKU DIDN'T REACT AT ALL
WHEN HE SAW ME.

380
00:21:22,528 --> 00:21:28,061
HAS HE TRULY FORGOTTEN
EVERYTHING ABOUT ME,
ABOUT HIMSELF?

381
00:21:28,094 --> 00:21:32,728
NO. HE DOESN'T EVEN KNOW
THAT NARAKU IS OUR SWORN ENEMY.

382
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:36,061
I WON'T ALLOW NARAKU
TO MANIPULATE KOHAKU.

383
00:21:36,094 --> 00:21:39,728
I MUST RESCUE HIM
FROM NARAKU'S EVIL GRIP.

384
00:21:39,761 --> 00:21:43,394
- BRING ME THE TETSUSAIGA,
INUYASHA'S PRECIOUS SWORD.

385
00:21:43,428 --> 00:21:49,361
ONLY THEN SHALL I LET
KOHAKU HAVE ETERNAL LIFE.

386
00:21:49,394 --> 00:21:51,761
- I MUST STEAL THE TETSUSAIGA

387
00:21:51,794 --> 00:21:56,294
IN ORDER TO SAVE
MY BROTHER--KOHAKU.

388
00:21:58,794 --> 00:22:01,528
[SINGING IN JAPANESE]

389
00:23:33,594 --> 00:23:37,928
- NARAKU TOLD SANGO TO STEAL
INUYASHA'S SWORD IN EXCHANGE
FOR HER BROTHER'S LIFE?

390
00:23:37,961 --> 00:23:41,294
NARAKU IS THE ABSOLUTE
WORST SCUM OF THE EARTH.

391
00:23:41,328 --> 00:23:43,661
KOHAKU IS BEING USED
IN THE WORST WAY,

392
00:23:43,694 --> 00:23:46,594
BUT WE CAN'T FIGHT HIM
AND RISK KILLING HIM.

393
00:23:46,628 --> 00:23:48,428
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO
ATTACK THE CASTLE

394
00:23:48,461 --> 00:23:50,494
AND DESTROY NARAKU
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

395
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:54,028
EVEN I'M ANGRY ENOUGH
TO DO IT NOW.

396
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:57,294
NEXT TIME:
"TETSUSAIGA IS STOLEN!

397
00:23:57,328 --> 00:23:59,394
SHOWDOWN AT NARAKU'S CASTLE!"

398
00:23:59,428 --> 00:24:00,428
SEE YOU SOON!
