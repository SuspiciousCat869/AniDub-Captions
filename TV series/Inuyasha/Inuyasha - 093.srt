>> HE'S NEVER BEEN THIS POPULAR

250
00:10:03,007 --> 00:10:04,974

HUMILIATION OF BEING TIED UP.

258
00:10:16,907 --> 00:10:18,741

259
00:10:18,741 --> 00:10:20,041
>> IT'S VERY SIMPLE.

260
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,307
THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN MY

WHO CARES WHEN IT HAPPENED?

283
00:10:56,741 --> 00:10:58,341

>> I DON'T GET IT, MIROKU.

291
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:10,941
IF IT WASN'T YOU, THEN WHO COULD

292
00:11:10,941 --> 00:11:13,123

HAPPENED UPON THIS VILLAGE QUITE

302
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,907
BY CHANCE, AND I SENSED A VERY

303
00:11:32,907 --> 00:11:37,941
SUSPICIOUS DEMONIC AURA.

304

SENSE THE PRESENCE OF THE DEMON

308
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:47,741
THAT PLAGUES OUR VILLAGE.

309

WE MUST ASK YOU TO SLAY THE

310
00:11:49,374 --> 00:11:53,174
DEMON AT ONCE.

311
00:11:53,174 --> 00:11:54,407
I COULD HAVE SWORN YOU JUST GREW

312
00:11:54,407 --> 00:11:57,007
LARGER FOR AN INSTANT.

313

314
00:12:04,474 --> 00:12:07,007
>> A FAKE?

315
00:12:07,007 --> 00:12:08,141
>> I'M AFRAID SO.

316
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,841
SOMEONE USING MY IDENTITY IS UP

317
00:12:09,841 --> 00:12:13,307
TO NO GOOD IN THIS REGION.

318
00:12:13,307 --> 00:12:14,607
DO YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ME LIKE

319
00:12:14,607 --> 00:12:16,307
THAT?

320
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:17,141
THINK ABOUT IT.

321
00:12:17,141 --> 00:12:18,174
THAT'S THE ONLY POSSIBLE

322
00:12:18,174 --> 00:12:20,007
EXPLANATION.

323
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,274

>> WHY WOULD SOMEONE IMPERSONATE

326
00:12:24,074 --> 00:12:26,241
YOU OF ALL PEOPLE?

327
00:12:26,241 --> 00:12:27,407
>> IF I WAS GOING TO BE SOMEONE,

328
00:12:27,407 --> 00:12:29,741
I'D PICK SOMEBODY IMPORTANT.

329
00:12:29,741 --> 00:12:30,974
>> AND THAT IS WHY I AM

330

00:12:32,407 --> 00:12:33,341
OUT.

332
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:34,474
>> WE DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL THESE

333
00:12:34,474 --> 00:12:35,207
THEORIES.

334
00:12:35,207 --> 00:12:36,141

>> I KNOW.

339
00:12:40,574 --> 00:12:41,307
WE DON'T TRUST HIM EITHER, BUT

340
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:42,307
HE SAID HE DIDN'T DO THIS TO

341
00:12:42,307 --> 00:12:43,974
YOU.

342
00:12:43,974 --> 00:12:45,607

343
00:12:45,607 --> 00:12:46,407
>> WHY DON'T WE FIND OUT THE

344
00:12:46,407 --> 00:12:47,541
TRUTH FIRST, AND THEN YOU CAN

345
00:12:47,541 --> 00:12:49,741
THROW HIM IN THE RIVER.

346
00:12:49,741 --> 00:12:50,941
>> I DON'T EVEN CARE ANYMORE.

347
00:12:50,941 --> 00:12:52,374
JUST UNTIE ME.

348
00:12:52,374 --> 00:12:53,541
>> DON'T TRY TO TALK YOUR WAY

349
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,707
OUT OF THIS, BECAUSE IT'S NOT

350
00:12:54,707 --> 00:12:55,607
GOING TO WORK.

351
00:12:55,607 --> 00:12:56,274
>> I'M NOT!

352
00:12:56,274 --> 00:12:57,107
>> OK, THEN.

353
00:12:57,107 --> 00:12:58,607
IF YOU'RE SOMEONE ELSE, SHOW US

354
00:12:58,607 --> 00:12:59,307
PROOF.

355
00:12:59,307 --> 00:13:00,574
>> HOW CAN I DO THAT?

356
00:13:00,574 --> 00:13:01,774
>> THAT'S NOT GOING TO BE EASY.

357
00:13:01,774 --> 00:13:04,307
>> I'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THIS

358
00:13:04,307 --> 00:13:07,541
RACKET.

359
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:09,007
HEY, YOU THERE, IF YOU'RE GOING

360
00:13:09,007 --> 00:13:11,141
TO INSIST THAT MIROKU IS GUILTY,

361
00:13:11,141 --> 00:13:13,041
THEN HOW ABOUT YOU SHOW US SOME

362
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:14,774
PROOF?

363
00:13:14,774 --> 00:13:15,974
>> WHY DOES HE ALWAYS HAVE TO BE

364
00:13:15,974 --> 00:13:17,474
SO ROUGH?

365
00:13:17,474 --> 00:13:20,907
>> I KNEW YOU'D SAY THAT.

366
00:13:20,907 --> 00:13:22,607
THEN WE'LL SHOW YOU.

367
00:13:22,607 --> 00:13:24,307
READY, MEN?

368
00:13:24,307 --> 00:13:26,829
>> HERE'S YOUR PROOF?

369
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:37,541
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER?

370
00:13:37,541 --> 00:13:39,907
>> HAS HE LOST HIS MIND?

371
00:13:39,907 --> 00:13:40,674
>> LEAVES.

372
00:13:40,674 --> 00:13:42,407
NOW IT ALL MAKES SENSE.

373
00:13:42,407 --> 00:13:46,907
I HAVE UNRAVELED THIS MYSTERY.

374
00:13:46,907 --> 00:13:48,807
>> MAYBE, BUT WITH YOU ALL TIED

375
00:13:48,807 --> 00:13:49,807
UP LIKE THAT...

376
00:13:49,807 --> 00:13:51,141
>> YOU JUST DON'T LOOK TOO

377
00:13:51,141 --> 00:13:52,574
CONVINCING.

378
00:13:52,574 --> 00:13:53,741
>> THAT'S WHY I KEEP ASKING YOU

379
00:13:53,741 --> 00:13:54,707
TO UNTIE ME.

380
00:13:54,707 --> 00:13:56,107
HASN'T ANYBODY BEEN LISTENING?

381
00:13:56,107 --> 00:13:58,088
COME ON!

382
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,355
>> LET'S HURRY.

383
00:14:07,355 --> 00:14:08,288
THE IMPOSTOR IS HEADING FOR THE

384
00:14:08,288 --> 00:14:11,388
NEXT VILLAGE.

385
00:14:11,388 --> 00:14:13,255
>> MIROKU, COME ON!

386
00:14:13,255 --> 00:14:14,422
TELL US, WILL YOU?

387
00:14:14,422 --> 00:14:16,455
JUST WHO IS THIS IMPOSTOR?

388
00:14:16,455 --> 00:14:17,355
>> WE'LL KNOW FOR SURE WHEN WE

389
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:18,222
GET THERE.

390
00:14:18,222 --> 00:14:19,622
HE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS ME WELL AND

391
00:14:19,622 --> 00:14:22,022
CAN IMITATE ME.

392
00:14:22,022 --> 00:14:23,388
IT WAS THAT LEAF THAT GAVE HIM

393
00:14:23,388 --> 00:14:24,389
AWAY.

394
00:14:32,488 --> 00:14:34,288
>> GO INSIDE, MONK.

395
00:14:34,288 --> 00:14:35,755
>> YES, RIGHT.

396
00:14:35,755 --> 00:14:36,788
>> THERE IS A SHRINE DEEP IN

397
00:14:36,788 --> 00:14:37,722
THIS CAVE.

398
00:14:37,722 --> 00:14:39,455
YOU CAN'T MISS IT.

399
00:14:39,455 --> 00:14:40,655
>> THE SPIRIT OF A RACCOON DOG

400
00:14:40,655 --> 00:14:42,088
NOW HAUNTS THE INTERIOR OF THE

401
00:14:42,088 --> 00:14:45,122
SHRINE.

402
00:14:45,122 --> 00:14:46,422
>> A RACCOON DOG?

403
00:14:46,422 --> 00:14:48,855
THEN HE SHOULD LISTEN TO REASON.

404
00:14:48,855 --> 00:14:50,655
>> THERE WOULD BE NO PROBLEM IF

405
00:14:50,655 --> 00:14:52,255
IT FED ON MOUNTAIN PREY, BUT NOW

406
00:14:52,255 --> 00:14:53,655
IT ATTACKS OUR LIVESTOCK IN

407
00:14:53,655 --> 00:14:54,622
FIELDS.

408
00:14:54,622 --> 00:14:55,955
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

409
00:14:55,955 --> 00:14:57,055
>> WE'VE CONFIDENT THAT YOU,

410
00:14:57,055 --> 00:14:58,755
MONK MIROKU, CAN PUT AN END TO

411
00:14:58,755 --> 00:14:59,988
OUR PROBLEM.

412
00:14:59,988 --> 00:15:02,122
>> BUT PLEASE, DO BE CAREFUL.

413
00:15:02,122 --> 00:15:03,188
>> NOTHING TO FEAR.

414
00:15:03,188 --> 00:15:04,289
LEAVE IT TO ME.

415
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:11,522
YOO-HOO, RACCOON DOG!

416
00:15:11,522 --> 00:15:12,388
COME ON OUT.

417
00:15:12,388 --> 00:15:16,022
SHOW YOURSELF IF YOU'RE IN HERE.

418
00:15:16,022 --> 00:15:19,655
THAT MUST BE THE SHRINE.

419
00:15:19,655 --> 00:15:22,422
>> WHAT DO YOU WANT?

420
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,255
>> CALM DOWN.

421
00:15:23,255 --> 00:15:24,555
IT'S JUST A RACCOON DOG, NOTHING

422
00:15:24,555 --> 00:15:26,488
MORE.

423
00:15:26,488 --> 00:15:31,888
>> ARE YOU THE DEMON?

424
00:15:31,888 --> 00:15:34,088
>> WHAT BUSINESS DOES A MORTAL

425
00:15:34,088 --> 00:15:38,055
HAVE WITH ME?

426
00:15:38,055 --> 00:15:40,488
>> YOU ARE A RACCOON DOG.

427
00:15:40,488 --> 00:15:42,455
>> I'M A WEASEL!

428
00:15:42,455 --> 00:15:44,388
>> YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A RACCOON

429
00:15:44,388 --> 00:15:46,122
DOG TO ME.

430
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:48,888
>> WE DON'T EVEN LOOK CLOSE!

431
00:15:48,888 --> 00:15:51,349
BUT I LOVE EATING RACCOON DOGS.

432
00:15:56,055 --> 00:15:58,822
ARE YOU REALLY A HUMAN?

433
00:15:58,822 --> 00:16:00,722
YOU SMELL MORE LIKE VERMIN TO

434
00:16:00,722 --> 00:16:02,455
ME.

435
00:16:02,455 --> 00:16:05,422
>> NOT GOOD.

436
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,255
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

437
00:16:07,255 --> 00:16:09,488
MY NAME IS MIROKU, AND IF I DO

438
00:16:09,488 --> 00:16:11,455
SAY SO MYSELF, I AM A FAMOUS

439
00:16:11,455 --> 00:16:13,655
MONK AROUND THESE PARTS.

440
00:16:13,655 --> 00:16:15,422
>> MIROKU?

441
00:16:15,422 --> 00:16:17,388
THE ONE WHO USES THE WIND

442
00:16:17,388 --> 00:16:18,655
TUNNEL?

443
00:16:18,655 --> 00:16:19,555
>> PRECISELY.

444
00:16:19,555 --> 00:16:20,722
APOLOGIZE NOW AND I'LL FORGIVE

445
00:16:20,722 --> 00:16:23,022
YOUR TRANSGRESSIONS.

446
00:16:23,022 --> 00:16:25,788
>> THIS IS AN OPPORTUNE TIME.

447
00:16:25,788 --> 00:16:27,288
I SHALL DEVOUR YOU AND BECOME

448
00:16:27,288 --> 00:16:28,788
THE MOST POWERFUL DEMON IN THE

449
00:16:28,788 --> 00:16:30,688
WORLD!

450
00:16:30,688 --> 00:16:31,355
>> NO!

451
00:16:31,355 --> 00:16:32,597
PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!

452
00:16:38,688 --> 00:16:41,188
>> BUT HOW DID YOU GET OUT HERE?

453
00:16:41,188 --> 00:16:42,322

454
00:16:42,322 --> 00:16:43,955
WE SAW YOU GO INSIDE THE CAVE,

455

MIROKU.

456

>> WE'D BETTER HURRY.

457
00:16:51,022 --> 00:16:56,822
>> WHERE DID THIS COME FROM?

458
00:16:56,822 --> 00:16:58,688
YOU ARE A RACCOON DOG--THE

459
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:00,850
MISSING INGREDIENT FOR MY STEW.

460

>> STAY WHERE YOU ARE!

461
00:17:14,055 --> 00:17:15,588
COME ANY CLOSER, EVIL DEMON, AND

462
00:17:15,588 --> 00:17:16,655
I'LL EXPOSE YOU TO MY WIND

463
00:17:16,655 --> 00:17:20,122
TUNNEL.

464
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,488
>> I DARE YOU.

465
00:17:21,488 --> 00:17:22,622
>> ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO TEST

466
00:17:22,622 --> 00:17:24,755
YOUR LUCK?

467
00:17:24,755 --> 00:17:26,188

469
00:17:28,555 --> 00:17:34,288

00:17:41,922 --> 00:17:43,055
I PROMISE TO STOP THIS!

475
00:17:43,055 --> 00:17:46,155
PLEASE FORGIVE ME!

482
00:18:06,455 --> 00:18:07,522
PARTNER.

483
00:18:07,522 --> 00:18:09,322
>> HEY, YOU, RACCOON DOG!

484
00:18:09,322 --> 00:18:11,655
>> I SAID I'M A WEASEL!

485
00:18:11,655 --> 00:18:13,088
>> I DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT.

486
00:18:13,088 --> 00:18:14,255
>> JUST GO BACK QUIETLY TO YOUR

487

MOUNTAIN.

488
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:16,588
I SIMPLY DETEST VIOLENCE, SO

489
00:18:16,588 --> 00:18:18,122
LET'S BE CIVIL ABOUT THIS AND DO

490
00:18:18,122 --> 00:18:20,388
THE RIGHT THING, OK?

491
00:18:20,388 --> 00:18:22,255
>> YOU'RE ALL JUST RACCOON DOGS.

492
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:23,222
DON'T TALK BIG.

493
00:18:23,222 --> 00:18:24,222
I'LL MAKE STEW OUT OF ALL OF

>> I GUESS THIS RACCOON DOG

496
00:18:30,688 --> 00:18:33,655
DOESN'T UNDERSTAND REASON.

497
00:18:33,655 --> 00:18:35,488
WIND TUNNEL!

498
00:18:35,488 --> 00:18:41,388

I WAS SO HUNGRY I COULDN'T BEAR

534

SOMETHING FROM YOUR MISTAKES AND

549
00:20:06,255 --> 00:20:07,588
WILL NEVER TRY ANYTHING SO
