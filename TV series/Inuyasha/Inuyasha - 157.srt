00:18:19,951 --> 00:18:21,617
>> ANSWER ME.

349
00:18:21,617 --> 00:18:23,617
>> I WAS TAKING A BREATHER.

350
00:18:23,617 --> 00:18:24,951
IT'S TIRING BEING WITH YOU

351
00:18:24,951 --> 00:18:29,284
EVERY SINGLE MINUTE OF THE DAY.

352
00:18:29,284 --> 00:18:35,417
>> HUH?

00:19:06,784 --> 00:19:07,984
>> THIS ARROW.

360
00:19:07,984 --> 00:19:09,851
KAGOME WAS THE ONE WHO SHOT IT,

361
00:19:09,851 --> 00:19:11,717
BUT ITS SPIRITUAL POWER BELONGS

362
00:19:11,717 --> 00:19:13,684
TO KIKYO.

363
00:19:13,684 --> 00:19:15,451
HAKUDOSHI'S BARRIER CONNECTED

364
00:19:15,451 --> 00:19:17,217
ME TO THIS WORLD.

365
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,551
IF I'D BEEN SHOT A MOMENT

366
00:19:18,551 --> 00:19:20,217
SOONER, I WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

367
00:19:20,217 --> 00:19:23,317
ABLE TO RETURN.

368
00:19:23,317 --> 00:19:24,717
HA HA HA HA.

369
00:19:24,717 --> 00:19:25,884
I GUESS I HAVEN'T RUN OUT

370
00:19:25,884 --> 00:19:34,284
OF LUCK JUST YET.

371
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:36,317
>> HOSENKI, I'M GOING TO TAKE

372
00:19:36,317 --> 00:19:38,017
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

373
00:19:38,017 --> 00:19:40,451
>> DO AS YOU PLEASE.

374
00:19:40,451 --> 00:19:43,351
INUYASHA, I WAS UNABLE TO

375
00:19:43,351 --> 00:19:45,851
PROTECT THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

376
00:19:45,851 --> 00:19:47,084
I DIDN'T THINK THAT ANYTHING

377
00:19:47,084 --> 00:19:48,817
EVIL WOULD COME THIS FAR IN

378
00:19:48,817 --> 00:19:50,484
ITS PURSUIT.

379
00:19:50,484 --> 00:19:52,284
I WAS NOT ABLE TO PUT AN END

380
00:19:52,284 --> 00:19:53,617
TO THE FIGHTING OVER

381
00:19:53,617 --> 00:19:57,151
THE SACRED JEWEL SHARD.

382
00:19:57,151 --> 00:19:59,051
>> IT WON'T END YET,

383
00:19:59,051 --> 00:20:00,551
NOT UNTIL THE SACRED JEWEL

384
00:20:00,551 --> 00:20:04,884
IS GONE FOR GOOD.

385
00:20:04,884 --> 00:20:06,551
I HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO RID THE

386
00:20:06,551 --> 00:20:09,184
WORLD OF THE JEWEL OF 4 SOULS.

387
00:20:09,184 --> 00:20:10,584
THE ONLY THING I CAN DO IS

388
00:20:10,584 --> 00:20:12,384
FIGHT EVIL DEMONS LIKE NARAKU

389
00:20:12,384 --> 00:20:14,817
WHO PURSUE IT.

390
00:20:14,817 --> 00:20:17,151
SO UNTIL NARAKU'S DEAD,

391
00:20:17,151 --> 00:20:18,284
UNTIL THERE'S NO ONE LEFT

392
00:20:18,284 --> 00:20:19,917
WHO COVETS THE JEWEL,

393
00:20:19,917 --> 00:20:24,651
I'LL KEEP FIGHTING THEM.

394
00:20:24,651 --> 00:20:25,951
>> MMM.

395
00:20:25,951 --> 00:20:27,017
INSTEAD OF PROTECTING

396
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:28,417
THE SHARD,

397
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:30,117
INSTEAD OF RUNNING AWAY,

398
00:20:30,117 --> 00:20:32,184
YOU CHOOSE TO FIGHT?

399
00:20:32,184 --> 00:20:34,317
THEN RETURN TO YOUR WORLD.

400
00:20:34,317 --> 00:20:35,517
IF YOU LINGER,

401
00:20:35,517 --> 00:20:38,651
THE GATE WILL CLOSE.

402
00:20:38,651 --> 00:20:39,717
>> CLOSE?

403
00:20:39,717 --> 00:20:41,384
MASTER INUYASHA, YOU MUST

404
00:20:41,384 --> 00:20:43,551
GO AFTER LORD SESSHOMARU!

405
00:20:43,551 --> 00:20:44,884
HURRY!

406
00:20:44,884 --> 00:20:46,151
>> DID YOU HEAR THAT?

407
00:20:46,151 --> 00:20:46,884
>> YEAH.

408
00:20:46,884 --> 00:20:50,217
I'M COMING.

409
00:20:50,217 --> 00:20:51,551
>> NOW GET OUT OF HERE,

410
00:20:51,551 --> 00:20:53,651
HALF-DEMON.

411
00:20:53,651 --> 00:20:56,151
>> RIGHT.

412
00:20:56,151 --> 00:20:57,384
LET'S GO, PEOPLE!

413
00:20:57,384 --> 00:20:58,051
>> RIGHT.

414
00:20:58,051 --> 00:21:01,717
>> YEAH!

415
00:21:01,717 --> 00:21:05,084
>> I WON'T LET GO!

416
00:21:05,084 --> 00:21:07,984
LORD SESSHOMARU, PLEASE WAIT!

417
00:21:07,984 --> 00:21:09,984
LORD SESSHOMARU!

418
00:21:09,984 --> 00:21:11,317
>> PIPE DOWN AND QUIT MAKING

419
00:21:11,317 --> 00:21:13,351
SUCH A FUSS.

420
00:21:13,351 --> 00:21:14,851
>> WHAT'S THE MATTER, SANGO?

421
00:21:14,851 --> 00:21:17,084
YOU SEEM SORT OF BLUE.

00:21:17,084 --> 00:21:20,417
>> MIROKU, YOU HEARD INUYASHA.

423

THAT UNTIL THE SACRED JEWEL

424
00:21:21,551 --> 00:21:22,951
DISAPPEARS,

425
00:21:22,951 --> 00:21:25,817
THE FIGHTING OVER IT WON'T END.

426
00:21:25,817 --> 00:21:27,317
YOU KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

427
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:28,151
>> YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT

428
00:21:28,151 --> 00:21:33,151
YOUR LITTLE BROTHER KOHAKU.

429
00:21:33,151 --> 00:21:34,817
>> KOHAKU'S LIFE IS LINKED TO

430

431
00:21:36,484 --> 00:21:38,151
IN HIS BACK.

432
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:40,484
WHEN THE SACRED JEWEL IS GONE,

433
00:21:40,484 --> 00:21:44,484
KOHAKU'S LIFE WILL GO WITH IT.

00:21:47,651 --> 00:21:50,817
AND HIS BODY WAS TORN TO SHREDS.

437

WHERE IS IT?

438
00:21:52,151 --> 00:21:59,651
