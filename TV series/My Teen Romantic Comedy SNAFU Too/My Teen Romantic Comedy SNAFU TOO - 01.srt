1
00:00:46,914 --> 00:00:50,622
So tell me... how's this your "go to" solution?

2
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:03,412
See... it's easy.

3
00:01:03,485 --> 00:01:05,519
I've made a world where no one gets hurt.

4
00:02:38,036 --> 00:02:41,702
<i>The culture festival and the athletic
festival ended with no huge mistakes,</i>

5
00:02:42,076 --> 00:02:45,120
<i>and in the blink of an eye the
collective school temperature dropped,</i>

6
00:02:45,192 --> 00:02:46,636
<i>and a cold wind blew.</i>

7
00:02:47,392 --> 00:02:50,279
<i>Furthermore... my surroundings are even bleaker.</i>

8
00:02:51,129 --> 00:02:52,423
<i>But it's always like that.</i>

9
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:53,143
Hey, bro!

10
00:02:53,252 --> 00:02:57,410
Why're you're leaving me out? What
am I Hikitani? Or is it Whatatani!

11
00:02:57,435 --> 00:02:58,932
<i>Yeah Yeah, very funny.</i>

12
00:02:59,952 --> 00:03:03,558
<i>By the way, my name from the
beginning has never been Hikitani.</i>

13
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:04,501
Yahello!

14
00:03:04,526 --> 00:03:06,070
Huh... Oh.

15
00:03:07,051 --> 00:03:08,729
You'll be at service club today, right?

16
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,382
Yeah.

17
00:03:09,582 --> 00:03:11,864
Okay. See you in the club room.

18
00:03:14,723 --> 00:03:15,366
Hachiman!

19
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:15,957
Hm?

20
00:03:16,228 --> 00:03:20,728
We need to pick our group for the Kyoto trip... our
teacher said we can do it during our homeroom class.

21
00:03:20,988 --> 00:03:24,354
Really? Seems like everyone
has already made up their groups.

22
00:03:24,735 --> 00:03:25,919
You really think so?

23
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:28,574
Because I haven't found a group to join yet...

24
00:03:30,667 --> 00:03:31,173
Uh...

25
00:03:33,086 --> 00:03:35,167
<i>I want to protect that smile!</i>

26
00:03:35,714 --> 00:03:37,620
Would you like to be in a group together then?

27
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:38,742
Mm...

28
00:03:38,767 --> 00:03:39,506
Hey!

29
00:03:42,032 --> 00:03:42,992
Hellooo!

30
00:03:43,286 --> 00:03:45,104
Hey, where'd ya go Hayato?

31
00:03:45,424 --> 00:03:47,630
Are you becoming a loner like Whatatani?

32
00:03:47,815 --> 00:03:49,816
Can't I go to the bathroom by myself.

33
00:03:49,841 --> 00:03:52,361
By the way, Tobe, you're using that joke way too often.

34
00:03:52,386 --> 00:03:55,121
Joke about him too much and you'll sink to his level...

35
00:03:55,146 --> 00:03:56,902
you need TO BE better than him.

36
00:03:56,927 --> 00:04:00,015
OH... so now it's about me! Cut me some slack, man!

37
00:04:10,747 --> 00:04:11,418
Thanks!

38
00:04:23,641 --> 00:04:24,968
Your tea's going to get cold.

39
00:04:25,588 --> 00:04:25,991
Huh?

40
00:04:27,043 --> 00:04:28,491
My mouth burns easily.

41
00:04:29,586 --> 00:04:32,970
I wish our school had picked somewhere
more exciting for our trip, like Okinawa.

42
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,725
Kyoto is pretty lame isn't it?

43
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:37,529
Actually there is quite a lot to do in Kyoto.

44
00:04:37,889 --> 00:04:40,388
We can see and experience this
country's culture first hand.

45
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,194
I don't think that's why we're really going.

46
00:04:43,114 --> 00:04:47,111
Really? Then why do you suppose they
make us go on these overnight school trips?

47
00:04:47,136 --> 00:04:49,312
They're giving us an imitation of society.

48
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:54,586
When you go on a business trip with your boss, you don't
get to choose where you stay or even what's for dinner.

49
00:04:55,238 --> 00:05:01,002
But if you compromise, it can be fun in its own way, it's
like practice for deceiving yourself in the future really.

50
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:04,216
Your school trip doesn't sound
like it's very much fun, Hikki.

51
00:05:04,287 --> 00:05:08,482
Come on surely even someone like you has to have
one or two things you're looking forward to seeing?

52
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,402
Maybe.

53
00:05:09,765 --> 00:05:11,184
<i>Like bathing with Saika...</i>

54
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:13,965
Well, I haven't had a chance
to look up anything about it yet.

55
00:05:14,525 --> 00:05:15,411
Have you, Yukinon?

56
00:05:15,436 --> 00:05:16,215
Well, let's see.

57
00:05:16,630 --> 00:05:19,271
There's Ryoan-ji, and Kiyomizudera temples...

58
00:05:19,718 --> 00:05:23,871
but I would also really like to go and see
the famous places around Rokuon-ji and Jishou.

59
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,857
Rokuonjishouji...

60
00:05:25,882 --> 00:05:26,817
Don't mix them up.

61
00:05:27,484 --> 00:05:29,864
They do kinda sound like pretty
cool character names though.

62
00:05:29,889 --> 00:05:31,582
Sorry to have gone and confused you two,

63
00:05:31,617 --> 00:05:34,845
their more common known names
are Kinkaku-ji and Ginkaku-ji.

64
00:05:34,921 --> 00:05:37,040
So why didn't you say that in the first place?

65
00:05:37,065 --> 00:05:37,967
And I guess...

66
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,648
that's about it.

67
00:05:41,127 --> 00:05:42,121
You know a lot!

68
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,003
What are you, a travel book or something?

69
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:46,246
<i>She's way too excited about this.</i>

70
00:05:46,689 --> 00:05:50,923
Having knowledge about Kyoto is
just general knowledge, isn't it?

71
00:05:51,165 --> 00:05:51,569
Hm?

72
00:05:57,549 --> 00:05:58,169
What is it?

73
00:05:58,333 --> 00:06:00,895
Oh it's nothing, nothing here to see at all!

74
00:06:03,596 --> 00:06:04,219
Come in.

75
00:06:06,603 --> 00:06:07,140
Hey!

76
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:08,921
Can we help you?

77
00:06:09,657 --> 00:06:12,660
He needs a consult about
something. So I brought him to you.

78
00:06:12,728 --> 00:06:16,217
Ah, it's nothing I mean nothing
I need to talk to Hikitani about.

79
00:06:17,317 --> 00:06:19,090
We came to ask for a favor, right?

80
00:06:19,115 --> 00:06:24,384
But I can't talk to him... not about this kind of
thing, his reliability is less than zero at this point!

81
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:25,712
Jerk...

82
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:29,566
You can't just walk into our room and say that.

83
00:06:29,591 --> 00:06:33,152
Well, it IS Hikigaya's fault, so it
can't be helped. He's just like that.

84
00:06:33,497 --> 00:06:34,307
I'm sorry...

85
00:06:35,566 --> 00:06:37,371
I'll need to ask you to leave the room now.

86
00:06:38,126 --> 00:06:40,625
That's fine, just let me know
when you guys are done in here.

87
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,814
Where you going? Just sit back down.

88
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,295
They're the ones who are leaving.

89
00:06:47,613 --> 00:06:50,674
They don't have manners or understand politeness.

90
00:06:51,268 --> 00:06:55,590
There is no need to listen to them or to
their rude pleas for our help at this time.

91
00:06:55,944 --> 00:06:58,521
I'm going to kindly ask you guys to please leave us again.

92
00:06:58,546 --> 00:07:00,315
Yeah, you guys are really annoying.

93
00:07:02,698 --> 00:07:04,714
Ah... we're very sorry.

94
00:07:05,129 --> 00:07:08,072
Let's go now, Tobe. We can figure it out on our own.

95
00:07:08,097 --> 00:07:11,194
I'm sorry but we can't go, we just gotta do this.

96
00:07:12,823 --> 00:07:14,816
Um... actually, I just...

97
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:17,408
What!

98
00:07:18,059 --> 00:07:21,764
So basically... you wanna confess
to Ebina and ask her out, correct?

99
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:23,433
Yeah, that's exactly right!

100
00:07:23,458 --> 00:07:25,639
But she'll probably just give me the cold shoulder.

101
00:07:25,664 --> 00:07:27,843
Ah... you don't wanna be rejected.

102
00:07:28,038 --> 00:07:30,478
This is gonna be so fun and super exciting!

103
00:07:30,576 --> 00:07:31,586
You've got this!

104
00:07:33,204 --> 00:07:35,609
I don't think it's really all that easy.

105
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:36,755
You may be right...

106
00:07:37,408 --> 00:07:39,908
Honestly... I don't think we'd be useful.

107
00:07:39,968 --> 00:07:42,610
What? It's okay... we can help him!

108
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:43,776
Please?

109
00:07:46,664 --> 00:07:49,650
What... don't try to force this decision on me.

110
00:07:49,768 --> 00:07:51,474
Hikitani... please...

111
00:07:51,786 --> 00:07:53,766
Hikitani... Please, man!

112
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:57,601
No, no, no. You're being too polite in
asking me... you're not really meaning it...

113
00:07:58,009 --> 00:07:59,486
And you're still getting my name wrong.

114
00:07:59,989 --> 00:08:03,126
Please Yukinon, Tobecchi's
looks pretty troubled about this.

115
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:06,431
If you really think he looks that
troubled, then I guess I'll think on it.

116
00:08:06,456 --> 00:08:09,771
Hey Yukinoshita, you've really
been spoiling Yuigahama lately.

117
00:08:13,484 --> 00:08:15,158
Okay, we'll do it.

118
00:08:15,933 --> 00:08:18,419
And what should we do, specifically?

119
00:08:18,746 --> 00:08:21,145
Well, I... I'll just come right out and ask you...

120
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:22,558
could you be my moral support?

121
00:08:22,583 --> 00:08:23,351
Perfect!

122
00:08:23,376 --> 00:08:25,828
I suppose we can understand your feelings on this.

123
00:08:26,053 --> 00:08:28,943
However, this could be a bit risky for you.

124
00:08:29,403 --> 00:08:30,426
What do you mean risky?

125
00:08:30,451 --> 00:08:33,848
Risky. The danger or the possibility of suffering a loss.

126
00:08:33,873 --> 00:08:37,482
I know what "risk" means Yukinon,
what I meant was what kind of risk.

127
00:08:37,573 --> 00:08:39,684
First he confesses, then she rejects him.

128
00:08:39,709 --> 00:08:41,379
So you already know she'll do that?

129
00:08:41,538 --> 00:08:42,466
But not only that.

130
00:08:42,718 --> 00:08:45,916
The next day, it's natural that everyone
in the class will know, as well, right?

131
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:51,453
It's okay if they know. But then you
start to hear them talking about you.

132
00:08:51,478 --> 00:08:54,587
So it seems like creepy Hikigaya confessed to Kaori!

133
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:58,323
Whoa, poor Kaori! I'm glad I
didn't tell him my email address!

134
00:08:58,797 --> 00:09:01,099
You'll be made the subject of everyone's gossip...

135
00:09:01,896 --> 00:09:04,009
and there's a tiny risk you'll get hurt.

136
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:06,444
Wait was that another one of your stories...

137
00:09:06,469 --> 00:09:07,819
Believe me there are others.

138
00:09:07,913 --> 00:09:11,955
For example, if you confess to one of your
good friends, your relationship after that is...

139
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,655
Okay, okay, we get it.

140
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:15,903
We'll be really careful on that front.

141
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:18,187
Well, gotta go to club practice.

142
00:09:21,565 --> 00:09:25,700
Okay, well for now, let's start
with some of Tobe's charming points.

143
00:09:28,326 --> 00:09:29,528
I'm friends with Hayato!

144
00:09:29,559 --> 00:09:31,443
You're immediately depending on others!

145
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:33,136
Surely you've got something else?

146
00:09:33,247 --> 00:09:35,420
How about... he's always cheerful?

147
00:09:35,493 --> 00:09:38,094
If it were that easy, then bald people would be popular.

148
00:09:38,189 --> 00:09:39,129
Yukinoshita?

149
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:40,396
Let's see...

150
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,026
Annoying... no that doesn't work, what about loud?

151
00:09:44,387 --> 00:09:45,601
Or how about noisy...

152
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,871
Or maybe lively will work. What do you think?

153
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:50,302
Okay, I got it.

154
00:09:51,094 --> 00:09:51,968
Change of plans.

155
00:09:51,993 --> 00:09:52,563
So fast!?

156
00:09:52,588 --> 00:09:56,829
Yes, instead of looking for Tobe's good
points, we'll change him into Ebina's type.

157
00:09:57,267 --> 00:09:58,890
Oh, I see!

158
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:02,934
There's something else. We should figure
out what Ebina's thoughts are about Tobe?

159
00:10:03,088 --> 00:10:03,695
Huh?

160
00:10:04,052 --> 00:10:05,748
Yea... I wonder that too.

161
00:10:05,883 --> 00:10:08,010
<i>Oh, well that seems to be obvious.</i>

162
00:10:08,381 --> 00:10:11,511
Yeah... me too... I really
wanna know what she thinks of me!

163
00:10:11,536 --> 00:10:12,513
You sure about that?

164
00:10:12,877 --> 00:10:15,119
This is the final judgment, there's no turning back.

165
00:10:15,144 --> 00:10:18,151
Well, if we don't know we can't
really move forward with this, right?

166
00:10:19,471 --> 00:10:21,346
<i>Alright... Let's hear it.</i>

167
00:10:25,021 --> 00:10:28,473
Well I think.. She believes you're just a really good guy.

168
00:10:28,793 --> 00:10:30,583
<i>Oh, that's unfortunate.</i>

169
00:10:30,729 --> 00:10:34,122
<i>When girls say "a good guy" it 100% means "I don't care."</i>

170
00:10:34,178 --> 00:10:36,270
Wow... that's a good thing, isn't it?

171
00:10:36,352 --> 00:10:38,203
<i>Your thinking is the only good thing.</i>

172
00:10:39,389 --> 00:10:40,295
I've got it!

173
00:10:40,492 --> 00:10:43,657
Exploring Kyoto will be a great
time to put this into action.

174
00:10:43,862 --> 00:10:46,972
If I remember correctly Hina said she likes Kyoto.

175
00:10:47,389 --> 00:10:48,640
If that's the case...

176
00:10:48,665 --> 00:10:52,116
we have to make a situation where
Tobe and Ebina are together alone.

177
00:10:52,141 --> 00:10:53,743
I wonder if we can make that work.

178
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:55,680
Come in.

179
00:10:56,574 --> 00:10:57,612
Excuse me!

180
00:10:58,183 --> 00:11:00,401
Oh, it's Hina!

181
00:11:00,536 --> 00:11:02,778
Hey there, Yui! Hello Hello!

182
00:11:02,998 --> 00:11:04,451
Oh... Ya hallo!

183
00:11:05,037 --> 00:11:07,193
<i>Huh, what is that? Some sort of tribal greeting?</i>

184
00:11:07,218 --> 00:11:10,043
And Hello hello, Yukinoshita and Hikitani!

185
00:11:10,486 --> 00:11:10,948
Hey.

186
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,935
Why don't you please come in and join us.

187
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:14,474
What's up?

188
00:11:14,842 --> 00:11:16,360
Um, well...

189
00:11:17,362 --> 00:11:18,767
It's about Tobecchi...

190
00:11:19,506 --> 00:11:21,239
I've got a bit of an issue.

191
00:11:22,157 --> 00:11:24,476
You mean with Tobecchi? What is it?

192
00:11:24,994 --> 00:11:27,184
Well... Tobecchi is...

193
00:11:27,209 --> 00:11:28,493
Tobecchi is what?

194
00:11:29,686 --> 00:11:30,516
Lately...

195
00:11:30,988 --> 00:11:34,711
it seems as if Tobecchi is getting
really close to Hayato and Hikitani!

196
00:11:34,742 --> 00:11:38,092
Which means Ooka and Yamato are getting sooo frustrated!

197
00:11:38,117 --> 00:11:40,193
I want to see them indulge into their relationships more!

198
00:11:40,218 --> 00:11:43,737
But with this new angle, the
love triangle will be spoiled!

199
00:11:49,209 --> 00:11:50,919
Well that's...

200
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:53,725
Don't you think Tobecchi's been
talking with Hikitani a lot recently?

201
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:56,414
They keep sending meaningful glances to each other.

202
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:00,575
If you're going to invite more people
in, then you should invite everyone.

203
00:12:00,708 --> 00:12:02,698
And also be more accepting of them.

204
00:12:02,934 --> 00:12:05,309
Actually, I want you to be inviting and accepting.

205
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,479
No way. Never.

206
00:12:06,504 --> 00:12:08,192
Tell us what you're actually trying to say?

207
00:12:09,074 --> 00:12:13,835
Maybe it's weird, but to me it feels like
the group dynamic has changed a bit lately...

208
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:18,962
Maybe. But just remember that males also have
complicated things happening in their lives too,

209
00:12:18,987 --> 00:12:20,450
such as in their relationships.

210
00:12:20,475 --> 00:12:23,361
Ew, complicated male relationships...

211
00:12:23,494 --> 00:12:24,787
That's so unlady like...

212
00:12:24,828 --> 00:12:26,353
Did I say just something awkward?

213
00:12:26,378 --> 00:12:28,649
No, you just summed it all up. It's okay.

214
00:12:29,463 --> 00:12:32,101
Our group dynamic was certainly different in the past.

215
00:12:32,126 --> 00:12:33,847
It just feels so weird now.

216
00:12:33,952 --> 00:12:36,264
I just wish we'd get along like we use to.

217
00:12:36,732 --> 00:12:40,882
Oh before I forget, I also think it
would be great if we got along with Hikitani.

218
00:12:41,222 --> 00:12:43,110
It'd be such a feast for my eyes!

219
00:12:43,135 --> 00:12:45,088
So for our upcoming school trip...

220
00:12:45,192 --> 00:12:47,603
I'm really looking forward to some great memories!

221
00:12:49,304 --> 00:12:51,359
Don't forget... invite people in!

222
00:12:51,981 --> 00:12:54,194
Thanks, Hikitani, I'll see you guys later!

223
00:12:56,691 --> 00:12:58,095
I wonder what that was about...

224
00:12:58,298 --> 00:12:59,197
I'm not sure...

225
00:12:59,331 --> 00:13:02,612
But maybe she's trying to make it
so that everyone gets along again.

226
00:13:02,866 --> 00:13:05,464
Oh, you think so? But, um, Hikki...

227
00:13:05,604 --> 00:13:08,072
How do you guys get along with each other anyway?

228
00:13:08,582 --> 00:13:12,249
Don't you think that asking Hikigaya
that sort of question is quite cruel?

229
00:13:12,629 --> 00:13:15,741
Really Yuigahama, try to be a little more thoughtful.

230
00:13:16,215 --> 00:13:16,621
'Kay?

231
00:13:16,966 --> 00:13:19,971
<i>Really. Think about my feelings a little more!</i>

232
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,642
Hmm...

233
00:13:25,676 --> 00:13:27,964
So how do you guys think we should pick our seats?

234
00:13:27,989 --> 00:13:28,909
Can't we just sit wherever?

235
00:13:28,934 --> 00:13:30,721
Ooh, I want the window seat.

236
00:13:31,574 --> 00:13:32,947
Thank you, Hayato!

237
00:13:33,715 --> 00:13:35,281
You two can sit next to me!

238
00:13:35,721 --> 00:13:38,515
So, Hina will sit here, and
Tobecchi can sit next to her...

239
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:40,637
Hey, you sit here, Yui.

240
00:13:40,662 --> 00:13:43,636
And I'll be here. And Kawasaki will be across from me.

241
00:13:43,661 --> 00:13:45,873
No... no, it's ok I'll sit somewhere else!

242
00:13:45,898 --> 00:13:47,549
No! It's okay.

243
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:53,216
So where do you think we should go sit?

244
00:13:58,492 --> 00:14:00,454
Stop it.. Hachi... Hachiman...

245
00:14:01,805 --> 00:14:04,495
Hey... this is getting to be difficult.

246
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,324
What did something happen over there?

247
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:07,981
All sorts of things...

248
00:14:08,467 --> 00:14:11,239
Kawasaki's been scaring Tobecchi this whole time,

249
00:14:11,264 --> 00:14:13,259
so the conversation isn't going anywhere.

250
00:14:14,012 --> 00:14:16,906
Hina is much more... Hina than usual.

251
00:14:17,473 --> 00:14:19,115
What a disaster for Tobe.

252
00:14:20,008 --> 00:14:22,509
I wish there was a way for
them to be alone with each other.

253
00:14:22,534 --> 00:14:25,360
But if only those two were there
together, maybe nothing would happen.

254
00:14:25,847 --> 00:14:26,838
You might be right.

255
00:14:27,413 --> 00:14:28,561
Oh, Tobe...

256
00:14:29,861 --> 00:14:31,485
Oh no, you heard that Saika?

257
00:14:31,825 --> 00:14:35,446
It's no big deal I also heard it
on our camping trip over summer.

258
00:14:35,784 --> 00:14:36,697
Right, Hachiman?

259
00:14:37,723 --> 00:14:38,356
Yeah.

260
00:14:39,582 --> 00:14:41,242
I have a confession...

261
00:14:41,495 --> 00:14:44,439
I think... I might actually like Ebina.

262
00:14:46,252 --> 00:14:46,925
Ah!

263
00:14:47,017 --> 00:14:49,304
Mount Fuji! Look, over there!

264
00:14:51,544 --> 00:14:52,847
<i>So close!</i>

265
00:14:53,423 --> 00:14:55,429
Ah, I want to see too.

266
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:58,075
Wow. Mount Fuji is just so beautiful!

267
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:02,997
<i>That type of innocent behavior... So many
boys misunderstand, resulting in certain death.</i>

268
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:06,997
<i>If you understand, commit and
say, "I won't make physical contact",</i>

269
00:15:07,197 --> 00:15:12,188
<i>"I won't sit on a boy's seat during break", and
"If I forget something, I won't borrow it from a boy."</i>

270
00:15:12,682 --> 00:15:13,020
What're you doing...

271
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,525
Oh, sorry! I'm going go back over to my seat now.

272
00:15:18,415 --> 00:15:19,935
Um, Hachiman...

273
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,557
Your arm, do you mind?

274
00:15:23,432 --> 00:15:24,952
Uh... Sorry! Sorry!

275
00:15:36,304 --> 00:15:37,130
Hikki!

276
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:38,740
Can I talk to you?

277
00:15:38,918 --> 00:15:39,807
We'll talk later.

278
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,097
Did you forget your job already?

279
00:15:42,164 --> 00:15:44,441
Look, I've already called Tobecchi and Hina.

280
00:15:44,761 --> 00:15:46,054
Come on, hurry up!

281
00:15:49,273 --> 00:15:50,615
It's so dark inside.

282
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,942
If I time it just right and we come in
from this side, they should end up alone.

283
00:15:55,535 --> 00:15:55,748
'Kay.

284
00:15:55,773 --> 00:15:57,475
I think we should all go in pairs!

285
00:15:57,841 --> 00:16:01,790
Yumiko and Hayato will go first, and
then Hikki and I will follow up last.

286
00:16:01,913 --> 00:16:05,805
I don't think we have much time left.. So
we shouldn't leave too much space between us.

287
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,897
I suppose you're right.

288
00:16:06,962 --> 00:16:09,456
I really don't think this will take very long, yeah?

289
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:10,856
I wouldn't worry about it!

290
00:16:11,029 --> 00:16:14,092
Right! I guess we don't really
need to get back early do we?

291
00:16:14,192 --> 00:16:14,643
Hm?

292
00:16:15,093 --> 00:16:18,711
Let's just go really quick, Hayato,
it looks like it'll be a lot of fun!

293
00:16:19,133 --> 00:16:21,352
Well... we'll just go ahead of you guys.

294
00:16:21,557 --> 00:16:21,987
Hm.

295
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:27,355
Whoa, it's really dark in here!

296
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:30,827
Seriously, though... this is MAXIMUM darkness here!

297
00:16:30,852 --> 00:16:31,716
Isn't it?

298
00:16:34,184 --> 00:16:37,348
It says we turn the rock and then we make a wish.

299
00:16:37,774 --> 00:16:38,536
Okay.

300
00:16:38,785 --> 00:16:40,371
Do you already know what to wish for?

301
00:16:40,678 --> 00:16:41,371
I do.

302
00:16:41,396 --> 00:16:42,999
'Kay, let's turn it together.

303
00:16:51,006 --> 00:16:52,907
<i>So that's what you do at a shrine.</i>

304
00:16:58,181 --> 00:16:58,914
Are you done?

305
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,099
Yeah.

306
00:17:00,134 --> 00:17:01,780
Alright let's get out of here then.

307
00:17:04,437 --> 00:17:07,021
Aww. I got "bad luck".

308
00:17:07,461 --> 00:17:09,194
Yea but, that's okay!

309
00:17:10,209 --> 00:17:12,694
Things can only get better
from here, so it's a good thing!

310
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,452
You think?

311
00:17:14,306 --> 00:17:14,787
Hey...

312
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:15,287
Huh?

313
00:17:15,917 --> 00:17:19,302
Offer to tie it up and be sure that you
do it in a higher place, that'd be better.

314
00:17:19,327 --> 00:17:19,775
Oh?

315
00:17:22,190 --> 00:17:24,091
Wait. Can I tie it up for you?

316
00:17:24,116 --> 00:17:24,567
Oh.

317
00:17:25,495 --> 00:17:27,708
Thank you! You're such a gentleman.

318
00:17:29,528 --> 00:17:32,560
It seems that he's really trying to do
his best even if we don't do anything.

319
00:17:32,946 --> 00:17:35,764
Wouldn't it be great, if it keeps going well like this?

320
00:17:35,964 --> 00:17:36,504
Yeah.

321
00:17:38,012 --> 00:17:40,896
I wonder if everyone here is aiming for luck in love.

322
00:17:40,921 --> 00:17:42,160
Uh... yeah.

323
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:45,996
What are you doing?

324
00:17:49,190 --> 00:17:51,357
Wow, this is really quite yummy.

325
00:17:51,986 --> 00:17:52,739
Here, Hikki.

326
00:17:54,187 --> 00:17:55,558
<i>Oh man no way...</i>

327
00:17:56,049 --> 00:17:59,414
Uh, thanks but no thanks... it's
had other people's mouths on it.

328
00:18:04,773 --> 00:18:07,745
Come on, seriously, that's not
something you should be worrying about.

329
00:18:08,085 --> 00:18:09,352
<i>I am worried about it.</i>

330
00:18:10,051 --> 00:18:13,475
Besides, if I drank from that I
wouldn't be able to focus on the taste.

331
00:18:17,991 --> 00:18:19,684
<i>There's no Max Coffee.</i>

332
00:18:23,016 --> 00:18:23,516
Hm?

333
00:18:30,829 --> 00:18:31,983
<i>Of course.</i>

334
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,087
<i>Night.</i>

335
00:18:49,709 --> 00:18:51,119
My, how unexpected.

336
00:18:51,144 --> 00:18:52,993
Should've said that earlier when you saw me.

337
00:18:53,793 --> 00:18:56,752
What's wrong? You leave because
your room was hard to be in?

338
00:18:56,903 --> 00:18:59,673
If it was that hard for me, I
wouldn't have come in the first place.

339
00:19:00,393 --> 00:19:00,957
And you?

340
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:05,969
I became the subject of my classmate's
gossip, so I decided to come here.

341
00:19:06,469 --> 00:19:08,933
I don't understand why they like that kind of talk.

342
00:19:09,026 --> 00:19:12,274
But if they're talking about you,
don't they want to get to know you?

343
00:19:12,808 --> 00:19:13,676
What if you tried?

344
00:19:14,053 --> 00:19:17,812
Well that's great advice coming from you...
considering at the cultural festival you-

345
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:18,996
Me? Wait...

346
00:19:19,263 --> 00:19:21,743
No... It's not my fault, it's society's fault.

347
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:28,247
And? What's the status of our request?

348
00:19:28,483 --> 00:19:30,720
It's not going well, but not badly either.

349
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:35,970
I'm sorry. Since I'm in another class I
can't really help with this assignment.

350
00:19:36,506 --> 00:19:37,558
Don't worry about it.

351
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:40,095
Even though I'm in the same class, I'm not doing much.

352
00:19:40,619 --> 00:19:41,699
Please work on that.

353
00:19:43,266 --> 00:19:43,766
Huh?

354
00:19:44,407 --> 00:19:45,007
Oh!

355
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:49,753
Yummm, that was so good!

356
00:19:49,778 --> 00:19:51,827
It was ferociously flavorful.

357
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:54,506
<i>That was specific.</i>

358
00:19:56,145 --> 00:19:58,984
But seriously, why did you take us out with you again?

359
00:19:59,009 --> 00:20:00,439
Can a teacher really do that?

360
00:20:00,464 --> 00:20:01,644
We're not supposed to.

361
00:20:01,978 --> 00:20:04,205
So I decided to pay you some hush-money in ramen!

362
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:06,998
I would image that's even less appropriate for a teacher.

363
00:20:07,451 --> 00:20:09,012
If you're caught, you'll be scolded.

364
00:20:09,037 --> 00:20:11,332
Being scolded isn't necessarily a bad thing.

365
00:20:11,585 --> 00:20:13,285
It's proof someone's looking out for you.

366
00:20:14,025 --> 00:20:16,073
I'm always looking after you guys too.

367
00:20:16,219 --> 00:20:18,150
So make all the mistakes you want.

368
00:20:18,673 --> 00:20:19,165
Hm?

369
00:20:21,476 --> 00:20:24,362
I'm going to go buy some party
supplies from the liquor store.

370
00:20:24,487 --> 00:20:26,512
Bye now. Get back safely!

371
00:20:57,460 --> 00:20:58,438
Take a right there.

372
00:20:58,674 --> 00:20:59,791
O... oh.

373
00:21:16,709 --> 00:21:19,222
Hey, if we get too far apart, you'll get lost again.

374
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:21,608
You can go on ahead of me.

375
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:24,846
It's not a big deal to stick together especially at night.

376
00:21:25,203 --> 00:21:26,074
It's right there.

377
00:21:26,550 --> 00:21:29,002
Maybe it's okay for you, but it's not for me.

378
00:21:29,027 --> 00:21:29,862
And why not?

379
00:21:30,956 --> 00:21:31,468
Well...

380
00:21:32,688 --> 00:21:37,431
Cause it's this late at night and
we're together, and if we were seen out...

381
00:21:38,461 --> 00:21:39,735
Yeah, you're right.

382
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:51,069
Bye.

383
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:54,242
Okay, good night.

384
00:21:56,662 --> 00:21:57,212
And...

385
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,340
thanks for walking back with me.

386
00:22:07,047 --> 00:22:10,106
When I get back, I'm gonna get in the bath with Saika.

387
00:23:41,492 --> 00:23:42,412
Kyoto, huh?

388
00:23:42,593 --> 00:23:44,347
Is there anywhere you want to go Hachiman?

389
00:23:44,565 --> 00:23:47,513
Let's see. No matter where we go, we'll be together.

390
00:23:47,706 --> 00:23:51,391
Or, as long as we're together anywhere
is fine! Oh, that's very Hachiman!

391
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:54,738
I want to go to Toei Kyoto Studio Park or Arashiyama.

392
00:23:54,884 --> 00:23:56,994
A hot spring at Arashiyama would be nice...

393
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:58,449
What? Hot spring?!

394
00:24:00,029 --> 00:24:01,250
S-Saika?

395
00:24:01,517 --> 00:24:02,950
Hachiman...

396
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:05,532
Shut up, Zaimokuza. Be quiet.

397
00:24:06,465 --> 00:24:07,929
Let's go together.

398
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:10,231
I want to protect this sleeping face!
