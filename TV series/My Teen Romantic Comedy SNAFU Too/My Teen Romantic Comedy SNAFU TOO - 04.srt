1
00:00:05,114 --> 00:00:05,997
Do you have a moment?

2
00:00:06,374 --> 00:00:06,975
What is it?

3
00:00:07,495 --> 00:00:10,840
I wanted to see what you thought would
be a good time to meet up on Saturday.

4
00:00:10,865 --> 00:00:11,298
Huh?

5
00:00:12,945 --> 00:00:14,882
Oh, you haven't heard about the plans yet?

6
00:00:15,602 --> 00:00:17,221
I've been texting with Orimoto...

7
00:00:17,447 --> 00:00:19,100
she wants to hang out on Saturday.

8
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:20,945
No, I didn't hear about that.

9
00:00:23,155 --> 00:00:25,082
I see... but would you wanna go?

10
00:00:25,107 --> 00:00:26,452
There's no way I'd go.

11
00:00:26,872 --> 00:00:27,340
Hm...

12
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,406
I thought maybe you could come and help me out.

13
00:00:32,961 --> 00:00:34,242
I won't be of any help...

14
00:00:34,969 --> 00:00:37,192
and you're not exactly someone who needs my help.

15
00:00:38,297 --> 00:00:40,707
Plus, I don't really wanna go anywhere on my day off.

16
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:44,041
I see...

17
00:00:52,579 --> 00:00:53,832
Hey, it's for you.

18
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:54,797
Huh?

19
00:00:56,331 --> 00:00:59,258
I'm goin' to bed now so be sure
to put it back up when you're done.

20
00:00:59,283 --> 00:01:00,362
O-okay.

21
00:01:03,232 --> 00:01:04,000
Hm...

22
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:06,021
Uh... hello?

23
00:01:06,046 --> 00:01:07,330
Yahello!

24
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,223
Are you fighting with your sister?

25
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:46,302
Compared to your situation, it's nothing.

26
00:02:47,933 --> 00:02:49,053
I see!

27
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:53,545
So, I heard you were invited on a date,
but for some reason you're not going?

28
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,783
I wasn't really invited though.

29
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:57,591
Hayato invited you.

30
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:59,272
It would be good if you went!

31
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,546
Nope, I'm not gonna go.

32
00:03:00,571 --> 00:03:04,962
What? Hayato doesn't usually humble
himself and ask people for things.

33
00:03:05,108 --> 00:03:06,961
He has a lot of pride.

34
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:07,721
Uh...

35
00:03:08,069 --> 00:03:13,578
Though I am curious as to why he wants to
bring you along for this outing in the first place.

36
00:03:14,048 --> 00:03:19,149
Isn't that good though? It's romantic to go
on a date with a girl you liked a long time ago.

37
00:03:21,566 --> 00:03:23,633
I wouldn't say I exactly liked her.

38
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:25,728
I don't understand what you mean by that.

39
00:03:26,819 --> 00:03:29,769
What I should've said is I was
pushing a one-sided desire...

40
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:33,586
She misunderstood things so you
can't call that something real.

41
00:03:36,735 --> 00:03:39,191
You're seriously a monster of reason.

42
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:42,136
What do you mean by that? That isn't true.

43
00:03:42,168 --> 00:03:45,704
Really... Then you're a monster of self-consciousness.

44
00:03:48,603 --> 00:03:49,586
Anyways!

45
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:53,822
You have to go on this date and if you don't, I'll
come and get you at your house and take you myself!

46
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:56,543
Hm...

47
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,710
Thanks, again for coming with me.

48
00:04:03,158 --> 00:04:05,187
It's cause Yukinoshita's sister is scary.

49
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:07,220
If you wanna thank someone, it's her.

50
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:10,270
But, hey, why did you change to a weekday for me?

51
00:04:10,295 --> 00:04:11,663
Uh... Is that them?

52
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:13,994
Sorry for the wait!

53
00:04:16,181 --> 00:04:17,059
Let's go, then.

54
00:04:21,604 --> 00:04:23,133
Shall we start with a movie?

55
00:04:23,231 --> 00:04:25,392
Yeah... I wanna see a movie.

56
00:04:25,437 --> 00:04:26,832
Yeah, yeah... that sounds like a really good idea!

57
00:04:26,857 --> 00:04:28,514
What type of movie should we watch?

58
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,082
Hmm... How about a romance?

59
00:04:30,182 --> 00:04:31,029
Sounds good!

60
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:41,453
Hey Hikigaya...

61
00:04:41,482 --> 00:04:41,958
Hm?

62
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:46,379
If our junior high school friends heard I was
at a movie with you, think they'd be shocked?

63
00:04:46,404 --> 00:04:47,213
Probably.

64
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:48,179
Totally!

65
00:04:55,764 --> 00:04:56,956
<i>If I think back on it,</i>

66
00:04:57,548 --> 00:04:59,883
<i>I feel like it was like this during junior high, too.</i>

67
00:05:00,782 --> 00:05:04,265
<i>Not once during those years had the
distance between us ever grown shorter.</i>

68
00:05:05,503 --> 00:05:09,213
<i>You see... Kaori Orimoto dealt with everyone the same way,</i>

69
00:05:09,323 --> 00:05:10,934
<i>even if she had no interest in them.</i>

70
00:05:11,569 --> 00:05:13,056
<i>That's just the way she is.</i>

71
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:17,694
<i>I had a feeling like I could end something...</i>

72
00:05:18,148 --> 00:05:20,169
<i>something that had never really even started.</i>

73
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:24,779
Wasn't that explosion so crazy?

74
00:05:24,882 --> 00:05:29,829
Hikigaya was super scared you guys. He totally
jumped at that one part; It was really funny!

75
00:05:29,998 --> 00:05:31,964
It was much louder than I expected.

76
00:05:32,107 --> 00:05:33,976
Oh yeah... I was a bit surprised.

77
00:05:34,001 --> 00:05:36,546
I was too but you didn't seem the least bit scared at all.

78
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:38,797
I know right, I thought that too!

79
00:05:38,822 --> 00:05:43,187
I was also a bit frightened by it...
but you acted completely normal, Hayama.

80
00:05:43,588 --> 00:05:45,924
But man, the way Hikigaya jumped.

81
00:05:46,634 --> 00:05:47,081
Yeah...

82
00:05:50,541 --> 00:05:52,484
<i>Are you enjoying making fun of me Orimoto?</i>

83
00:05:53,237 --> 00:05:56,785
If we don't hurry, we may run out
of time to look around the stores.

84
00:06:08,787 --> 00:06:09,220
Uh?

85
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:10,932
Huh?

86
00:06:11,297 --> 00:06:12,409
What's up, Ebina?

87
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:13,420
Hm?

88
00:06:14,298 --> 00:06:14,720
Uh...

89
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:20,480
Haya...!

90
00:06:21,135 --> 00:06:21,806
Ah!

91
00:06:22,263 --> 00:06:23,226
Waa!

92
00:06:25,701 --> 00:06:27,663
<i>Panties! Pink! Unexpected!</i>

93
00:06:29,506 --> 00:06:31,304
Whoa! Yumiko, are you okay?

94
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:33,634
No... Haya... Haya...

95
00:06:34,596 --> 00:06:36,514
It might be a good idea if we leave here soon.

96
00:06:36,872 --> 00:06:37,349
Huh?

97
00:06:38,833 --> 00:06:40,737
I want to go check out the snowboarding gear.

98
00:06:42,811 --> 00:06:44,784
Hey, isn't that Hayato?

99
00:06:48,393 --> 00:06:49,748
What's up there, Hayato!

100
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:51,075
Hey Tobe, what's up?

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:53,460
Listen to this, Iroha said she wanted a new jersey,

102
00:06:53,485 --> 00:06:56,972
so I came with her to buy one, but
so far it's only been about protein...

103
00:06:57,037 --> 00:06:57,455
Huh?

104
00:06:58,608 --> 00:07:01,853
Uh... sorry... did I just interrupt something?

105
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:04,319
Sorry about that man, we'll be going soon anyway.

106
00:07:04,344 --> 00:07:05,367
Right... Iroha?

107
00:07:06,655 --> 00:07:07,755
Hikigaya!!

108
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:11,084
<i>Holy cow she's fast! That's scary!</i>

109
00:07:11,566 --> 00:07:13,400
What seems to be going on with you?

110
00:07:14,263 --> 00:07:15,991
You guys all just hanging out here?

111
00:07:16,314 --> 00:07:17,817
<i>Is the meaning I get from that.</i>

112
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,865
No... we're not really hanging out...

113
00:07:20,935 --> 00:07:23,282
Then tell me who's that girl you're hanging with?

114
00:07:23,445 --> 00:07:25,939
Is that one a new girlfriend for you or something?

115
00:07:26,134 --> 00:07:28,474
Though actually, I see there are two there.

116
00:07:28,499 --> 00:07:29,853
So how do you know both of them?

117
00:07:29,878 --> 00:07:32,397
<i>Holy crap... Iroha is scary...</i>

118
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:35,614
<i>How is she saying that in such a
cold voice while smiling so much?</i>

119
00:07:36,356 --> 00:07:37,436
Sorry, Iroha.

120
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,215
I asked him to hang out.

121
00:07:40,286 --> 00:07:41,646
Oh, did you really?

122
00:07:41,872 --> 00:07:44,333
Well, I was just hanging out here myself too.

123
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:46,517
I know, how bout we hang out together?

124
00:07:46,542 --> 00:07:47,984
How bout later, Iroha...

125
00:07:48,008 --> 00:07:49,722
I think we should get going, okay?

126
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:51,299
Off we go!

127
00:07:51,451 --> 00:07:53,106
Hey, you wanna go to Lion Sports!

128
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,244
No, we don't have to.

129
00:07:54,308 --> 00:07:56,068
They mainly deal with baseball things.

130
00:07:56,093 --> 00:07:58,920
I see... Iroha also shows you that side of her.

131
00:07:58,991 --> 00:07:59,428
What?

132
00:07:59,783 --> 00:08:02,486
She wants everyone to think
she's cute and fun to hang out with.

133
00:08:03,123 --> 00:08:04,965
I think she just wants to be liked.

134
00:08:05,368 --> 00:08:07,564
She doesn't often show people her real self.

135
00:08:08,329 --> 00:08:12,709
<i>So that means, since she doesn't want to be
liked by me, she's showing me her true self.</i>

136
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:16,941
You liked her back in junior high, right?

137
00:08:17,272 --> 00:08:17,689
Huh?

138
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,563
You like that type of girl?

139
00:08:19,855 --> 00:08:20,911
Didn't expect that.

140
00:08:20,936 --> 00:08:21,631
Shut up...

141
00:08:21,987 --> 00:08:23,558
It wasn't just Orimoto.

142
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:26,934
I've also liked gentle girls,
and even the louder girls too.

143
00:08:27,883 --> 00:08:29,280
I've liked all different types.

144
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:32,068
So, you really can't say you like any type.

145
00:08:32,438 --> 00:08:35,505
Just because that's how it used to
be, doesn't mean it's still the same.

146
00:08:36,217 --> 00:08:37,051
That's true.

147
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:39,713
So then...

148
00:08:40,243 --> 00:08:43,101
I guess in the end we haven't
really loved anyone yet have we?

149
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:47,277
Neither you... nor me...

150
00:08:47,851 --> 00:08:51,231
Well, actually, I think... I might kinda sorta like Ebina.

151
00:08:51,641 --> 00:08:54,003
What about you, Hayato? Huh? Tell me.

152
00:08:54,028 --> 00:08:54,832
Well-I-uh...

153
00:08:54,857 --> 00:08:55,452
Come on!

154
00:08:55,638 --> 00:08:57,034
There's no way I'm gonna tell you.

155
00:08:57,134 --> 00:08:59,845
What's the big deal anyway?
Just spill the beans, will ya?!

156
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,155
At least give the initial!

157
00:09:04,866 --> 00:09:05,558
Y.

158
00:09:07,097 --> 00:09:08,884
That's why there was a misunderstanding.

159
00:09:13,261 --> 00:09:14,278
Aren't you hungry?

160
00:09:14,377 --> 00:09:15,624
I'm starving!

161
00:09:15,687 --> 00:09:16,768
What do you guys wanna eat?

162
00:09:16,843 --> 00:09:17,973
Anything is fine.

163
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:19,512
What do you think we should we eat?

164
00:09:19,722 --> 00:09:20,360
Hm...

165
00:09:21,811 --> 00:09:23,417
Saize... I guess.

166
00:09:23,744 --> 00:09:24,255
Wha?

167
00:09:24,523 --> 00:09:26,107
<i>You said anywhere was fine...</i>

168
00:09:27,048 --> 00:09:29,958
<i>What? Is Saize no good? Or am I no good?</i>

169
00:09:30,929 --> 00:09:33,050
Come on, it's not really that big of a deal.

170
00:09:33,547 --> 00:09:34,994
How about that cafe over there?

171
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:37,766
That food was really good!

172
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,594
Right! I found the food to be totally delicious!

173
00:09:39,619 --> 00:09:41,161
That really made me full!

174
00:09:41,186 --> 00:09:43,653
But thanks, you really do have the best taste, Hayama!

175
00:09:43,678 --> 00:09:44,920
He really does!

176
00:09:44,945 --> 00:09:46,903
Especially compared to some other people...

177
00:09:46,928 --> 00:09:48,241
What? You're gonna say it?

178
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:50,412
N-no, I'm not gonna say it!

179
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:51,563
But really...

180
00:09:51,844 --> 00:09:53,366
Saize of all places?

181
00:09:53,391 --> 00:09:54,897
I know, right?

182
00:09:54,966 --> 00:09:57,541
I didn't really know what he was talking about at first.

183
00:09:57,805 --> 00:09:58,761
Me neither!

184
00:09:58,844 --> 00:10:00,297
I'm glad we came here.

185
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:01,024
Yeah.

186
00:10:02,406 --> 00:10:04,756
Hey guys... I don't really like that.

187
00:10:06,065 --> 00:10:06,762
Huh?

188
00:10:12,121 --> 00:10:13,762
Yea... us too!

189
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,289
No... I didn't mean that.

190
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,304
I'm talking about the way you two are acting right now.

191
00:10:18,638 --> 00:10:19,399
Uh!

192
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:23,298
Uh... yeah, okay...

193
00:10:23,971 --> 00:10:25,371
Um... of course.

194
00:10:25,473 --> 00:10:26,508
Y-yeah...

195
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,724
Oh, there they are.

196
00:10:34,908 --> 00:10:35,340
Huh?

197
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:37,447
You guys...

198
00:10:39,467 --> 00:10:40,335
Hikki...

199
00:10:44,378 --> 00:10:45,624
Why are you two here?

200
00:10:46,139 --> 00:10:47,371
Because I called them.

201
00:10:52,063 --> 00:10:54,974
Hikigaya is not the kind of guy
you think you can just make fun of.

202
00:10:56,091 --> 00:10:58,821
He's friends with way better
girls than you two will ever be.

203
00:10:59,114 --> 00:10:59,880
Uh...

204
00:11:00,528 --> 00:11:04,377
If you were smart you would stop saying
such superficial and selfish things.

205
00:11:07,401 --> 00:11:07,972
Oh...

206
00:11:10,862 --> 00:11:11,482
Uh...

207
00:11:12,764 --> 00:11:14,677
Sorry. I'm going home.

208
00:11:15,252 --> 00:11:16,042
Yeah...

209
00:11:16,395 --> 00:11:18,609
Um, sorry, me too.

210
00:11:25,057 --> 00:11:25,943
I see.

211
00:11:33,446 --> 00:11:36,685
This not an election meeting? I was told that it was.

212
00:11:36,764 --> 00:11:38,905
Election meeting? For student council?

213
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,784
Um... we were hoping to maybe talk to
Hayato, about possibly running in the election...

214
00:11:47,171 --> 00:11:48,378
that is if... um...

215
00:11:48,906 --> 00:11:49,733
Oh really...

216
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:51,962
<i>Hayama running for president...</i>

217
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,489
<i>the choice in itself isn't out of the ordinary...</i>

218
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,004
<i>But...</i>

219
00:11:56,148 --> 00:11:57,148
Sorry 'bout that...

220
00:11:57,288 --> 00:11:59,469
I just thought that I'd try to do whatever I can.

221
00:11:59,805 --> 00:12:02,258
Ohhh, so I see.

222
00:12:03,015 --> 00:12:03,962
Big Sis...

223
00:12:04,144 --> 00:12:07,414
So, what's this then, you won't
run for student council president?

224
00:12:08,678 --> 00:12:10,728
I thought you would totally want to do that.

225
00:12:10,753 --> 00:12:11,173
Uh...

226
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:17,137
Instead you're going to force some other sucker
to do the job you don't want to bother with.

227
00:12:17,162 --> 00:12:19,015
Just like Mom always does.

228
00:12:20,605 --> 00:12:22,701
Well, I suppose that's fine for you.

229
00:12:24,368 --> 00:12:27,110
It's okay if you don't do anything, Lil Sis.

230
00:12:27,836 --> 00:12:30,104
Someone else will always do it for you.

231
00:12:30,808 --> 00:12:31,225
Uh...

232
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,290
So that's what this is about.

233
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:42,944
Hm...

234
00:12:43,667 --> 00:12:46,310
So, if we've got nothing more... I'm going home now.

235
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:49,980
Uh... wait up, Yukinon!

236
00:12:55,186 --> 00:12:57,602
Why'd you go to all that trouble just to do that to her?

237
00:12:57,708 --> 00:13:00,991
Do you really have to ask? This always happens.

238
00:13:01,390 --> 00:13:03,764
I think you've gone a bit overboard this time, though.

239
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:04,744
Oh yeah?

240
00:13:04,977 --> 00:13:06,335
Yeah, I mean I get it...

241
00:13:06,547 --> 00:13:10,180
I happen to have a younger sister, so I
can definitely see where you're coming from.

242
00:13:12,984 --> 00:13:16,325
You really do seem to know
everything, don't you, Hikigaya?

243
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:21,499
You don't need to make such a scary face at me.

244
00:13:21,726 --> 00:13:23,778
For real, I'm really impressed by you.

245
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:24,669
Thanks for that.

246
00:13:25,769 --> 00:13:26,751
You're funny though.

247
00:13:26,878 --> 00:13:30,918
You're always trying to search out the
hidden meaning in everyone's words and actions.

248
00:13:31,247 --> 00:13:33,425
I find that I really like that about you.

249
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:38,402
It's like you're afraid of malice or something.

250
00:13:38,427 --> 00:13:39,443
It's very cute.

251
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:43,792
I think people who can handle anything
flawlessly to be a bit boring, don't you?

252
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:50,962
Well, since I've satisfied my curiosity
for the day, I guess I'll go home too.

253
00:13:51,095 --> 00:13:53,714
Plus, things have gotten somewhat strained.

254
00:13:57,755 --> 00:13:59,795
You know you really don't need to look out for me.

255
00:14:00,909 --> 00:14:02,707
Don't worry, I don't intend to.

256
00:14:03,049 --> 00:14:05,848
Honestly, I just did what I felt like I wanted to do.

257
00:14:06,728 --> 00:14:09,538
What you said to Orimoto and Nakamachi...

258
00:14:11,726 --> 00:14:13,843
Was it really okay for you to do that to them?

259
00:14:13,950 --> 00:14:15,296
It was the worst feeling...

260
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:16,858
I rather not have done it.

261
00:14:17,862 --> 00:14:19,849
Well then, I guess, you shouldn't have done it.

262
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,865
Why don't you have a seat?

263
00:14:31,572 --> 00:14:33,191
This whole time I've been wondering...

264
00:14:33,842 --> 00:14:36,627
how do I go about fixing this thing I once destroyed.

265
00:14:37,044 --> 00:14:37,528
What?

266
00:14:38,387 --> 00:14:40,887
I knew you'd fix it... I expected it.

267
00:14:41,627 --> 00:14:44,672
Even though... I knew the penalties, I relied on you.

268
00:14:45,813 --> 00:14:47,827
Because of that... you...

269
00:14:49,084 --> 00:14:49,655
Hey.

270
00:14:50,027 --> 00:14:51,859
You really ought to know your own worth.

271
00:14:52,745 --> 00:14:54,931
And not only yours, but the people around you.

272
00:14:55,889 --> 00:14:57,251
What are you trying to say here?

273
00:14:57,445 --> 00:14:58,017
Tell me...

274
00:14:58,658 --> 00:15:00,377
It was just really difficult to handle.

275
00:15:01,216 --> 00:15:03,478
I should have just tried to do everything a bit better.

276
00:15:04,953 --> 00:15:06,799
But this is the only thing I could do.

277
00:15:07,985 --> 00:15:10,058
You've been doing things like this the whole time.

278
00:15:12,221 --> 00:15:13,155
So just stop...

279
00:15:13,688 --> 00:15:15,423
stop sacrificing yourself.

280
00:15:16,853 --> 00:15:18,287
I'm not the same as you.

281
00:15:18,822 --> 00:15:21,213
Sacrificing myself? Give me a break.

282
00:15:21,619 --> 00:15:23,536
Things like that, just come natural to me.

283
00:15:24,494 --> 00:15:26,093
Because I've always been alone.

284
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:29,281
So it doesn't matter who or what is around me.

285
00:15:29,881 --> 00:15:32,934
The things that happen in front of
my eyes are just parts of my life.

286
00:15:34,051 --> 00:15:35,695
Don't try to fix things you don't get.

287
00:15:37,259 --> 00:15:38,459
When you help someone...

288
00:15:39,146 --> 00:15:42,389
aren't you really just wishing that
you could be helped by someone in return?

289
00:15:46,692 --> 00:15:47,485
You're wrong.

290
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:51,417
Don't force your sympathies
on me or ever feel sorry for me.

291
00:16:01,565 --> 00:16:02,804
<i>Get off my back.</i>

292
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,283
<i>I won't let you call it a self-sacrifice.</i>

293
00:16:06,703 --> 00:16:09,574
<i>There's no way I would be a
sacrifice for a loser like you.</i>

294
00:16:10,167 --> 00:16:11,984
<i>Even if I can't put it into words...</i>

295
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:14,413
<i>I have a certain belief in myself.</i>

296
00:16:15,625 --> 00:16:17,534
<i>The one thing I shared with someone else...</i>

297
00:16:18,617 --> 00:16:21,595
<i>is the belief... that I've already lost.</i>

298
00:16:27,490 --> 00:16:29,943
Yukinoshita came to talk to me this morning.

299
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,840
She says she's going to run for student council president.

300
00:16:34,836 --> 00:16:35,982
Are you serious?

301
00:16:39,518 --> 00:16:41,300
What will you do, Hikigaya?

302
00:16:41,803 --> 00:16:42,954
I won't do anything.

303
00:16:43,363 --> 00:16:46,641
This is actually natural for her,
if you stop and really think about it.

304
00:16:48,381 --> 00:16:49,294
That's true.

305
00:16:50,014 --> 00:16:53,036
If the teachers and others hear
about it, they'll be really happy.

306
00:16:53,465 --> 00:16:55,191
You haven't told anyone about this, yet?

307
00:16:55,707 --> 00:16:56,460
I haven't.

308
00:16:57,114 --> 00:16:59,183
So, I'm going to ask you one more time.

309
00:16:59,514 --> 00:17:02,400
Hikigaya, what will you do now?

310
00:17:06,657 --> 00:17:07,460
Yukinoshita.

311
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:12,653
Are you planning to run for
student council president yourself?

312
00:17:12,946 --> 00:17:13,437
Huh?

313
00:17:15,814 --> 00:17:16,875
You didn't hear about that?

314
00:17:17,697 --> 00:17:18,290
No.

315
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,899
I was going to discuss it with her later.

316
00:17:20,924 --> 00:17:22,440
I wouldn't call that a "discussion".

317
00:17:22,966 --> 00:17:25,235
Is it because what your sister said to you?

318
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:26,945
She has nothing to do with this...

319
00:17:26,970 --> 00:17:28,219
this is what I want to do.

320
00:17:28,432 --> 00:17:29,747
Yukinon... what about the clu...

321
00:17:29,772 --> 00:17:30,652
It's okay.

322
00:17:31,489 --> 00:17:34,392
This club is not really that
difficult to have to deal with...

323
00:17:34,545 --> 00:17:39,653
and I understand how the student council activities
work so it won't be much of an extra burden for me.

324
00:17:40,145 --> 00:17:44,432
If you think objectively this
is the best solution all around.

325
00:17:44,719 --> 00:17:47,898
I will win against Isshiki and
there will be no problem with that.

326
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:49,237
Besides...

327
00:17:50,204 --> 00:17:53,337
Besides... I don't really mind taking on that role.

328
00:17:53,744 --> 00:17:55,567
That very well may be true and all,

329
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,652
but you said you wouldn't run from the beginning.

330
00:17:58,892 --> 00:18:00,919
Are you now talking about your own plan here?

331
00:18:01,165 --> 00:18:01,691
Yeah...

332
00:18:02,911 --> 00:18:05,332
Thinking you can influence everyone is arrogant.

333
00:18:05,873 --> 00:18:08,456
You honestly believe you can do it with your words alone?

334
00:18:10,269 --> 00:18:13,530
Well then... I'll have to think
about the method that considers that.

335
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:18,738
If you think everyone cares enough to hate you...

336
00:18:19,458 --> 00:18:21,961
then you're really thinking way too much of yourself.

337
00:18:25,722 --> 00:18:27,750
Face it, our methods are just different.

338
00:18:29,497 --> 00:18:30,267
That's true.

339
00:18:32,933 --> 00:18:36,138
I see... so that's how Yukinon does things...

340
00:18:44,436 --> 00:18:45,421
Wait a second...

341
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:51,626
Let's walk home together okay?

342
00:18:54,561 --> 00:18:57,291
Yukinon is gonna be in the election, isn't she?

343
00:18:59,461 --> 00:18:59,954
Yeah...

344
00:19:02,398 --> 00:19:03,119
Me too.

345
00:19:04,092 --> 00:19:05,671
I was thinking I'd give it a shot.

346
00:19:06,591 --> 00:19:07,066
Huh?

347
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,584
So that means... you're going
to run for president, as well?

348
00:19:11,163 --> 00:19:11,757
Hmh...

349
00:19:13,561 --> 00:19:14,887
Why are you doing this?

350
00:19:15,453 --> 00:19:16,520
Because, Hikki...

351
00:19:17,133 --> 00:19:18,020
I've got nothing.

352
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:24,218
There are so many things I can't
really do so I was thinking...

353
00:19:24,835 --> 00:19:28,948
that maybe I could actually do something
like this and help us out... you know?

354
00:19:29,308 --> 00:19:30,412
Are you serious?

355
00:19:30,831 --> 00:19:31,733
Don't just selfishly...

356
00:19:31,758 --> 00:19:33,175
I'm not selfish.

357
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:37,425
Everyone else here is selfish.

358
00:19:39,312 --> 00:19:40,933
Have you thought about this thoroughly?

359
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:42,323
I really have...

360
00:19:42,423 --> 00:19:46,029
I've sat and thought this idea through...
and I figured this is all that I can do.

361
00:19:49,324 --> 00:19:52,194
I promise. I'm going to do my best this time.

362
00:19:53,393 --> 00:19:56,190
I've noticed that I've always
tended to rely on you Hikki...

363
00:19:56,977 --> 00:19:58,008
that is until now.

364
00:20:00,176 --> 00:20:01,502
I haven't done anything.

365
00:20:02,136 --> 00:20:02,964
Oh really?

366
00:20:04,224 --> 00:20:05,097
Yes really...

367
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,263
you don't always have to try your best.

368
00:20:07,548 --> 00:20:08,708
It's not just that.

369
00:20:08,796 --> 00:20:09,216
Hm?

370
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:13,312
If Yukinon becomes the new student council president...

371
00:20:14,054 --> 00:20:16,575
she'll honestly make the best school president ever...

372
00:20:16,964 --> 00:20:18,842
and be exactly what this school needs...

373
00:20:19,677 --> 00:20:23,787
but then that means this club might not be around anymore?

374
00:20:24,192 --> 00:20:26,366
Come on, the club won't really go away.

375
00:20:26,471 --> 00:20:27,328
Yes, it will.

376
00:20:28,792 --> 00:20:30,090
Don't you remember, Hikki...

377
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:34,059
during the cultural festival,
Yukinon could only focus on one thing.

378
00:20:34,084 --> 00:20:35,141
Did you forget that?

379
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:36,969
Huh...

380
00:20:38,470 --> 00:20:38,937
I...

381
00:20:40,176 --> 00:20:43,499
Well... I just... really like this club.

382
00:20:47,064 --> 00:20:49,830
I... love us.

383
00:20:55,368 --> 00:20:58,661
But I mean... even if I happen
to become the student president,

384
00:20:58,686 --> 00:21:03,988
I was thinking that if I do it well, I can still be in
the club like I am now. You know cause I mean, it's me.

385
00:21:04,769 --> 00:21:07,236
And nobody's expecting anything from me.

386
00:21:09,005 --> 00:21:09,558
So...

387
00:21:10,838 --> 00:21:12,072
I'm gonna beat Yukinon.

388
00:21:16,101 --> 00:21:16,740
Yuiga...

389
00:21:17,621 --> 00:21:18,957
I'll be fine from here!

390
00:21:19,322 --> 00:21:20,536
Uh... See ya!

391
00:21:20,962 --> 00:21:22,062
O-okay.

392
00:21:25,095 --> 00:21:26,762
Bye bye... Hikki.

393
00:21:33,592 --> 00:21:34,772
<i>It's actually fine...</i>

394
00:21:35,632 --> 00:21:38,878
<i>if both Yuigahama and Yukinoshita
are in mutual agreement for this.</i>

395
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:40,646
<i>But...</i>

396
00:23:41,485 --> 00:23:46,173
Let's see, I'll have a Milano
Doria, a Pepperoncino, and a drink.

397
00:23:46,198 --> 00:23:47,446
Oh! And a fried chicken!

398
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:48,763
You're ordering way too much.

399
00:23:48,788 --> 00:23:50,716
Well, that's what's best about Saize.

400
00:23:50,741 --> 00:23:53,109
It has reasonable prices and food!

401
00:23:53,214 --> 00:23:55,177
That's true! Saize is the best!

402
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,559
Ah, I'd like a Focaccia and a drink.

403
00:23:57,781 --> 00:23:59,201
Is just that okay?

404
00:23:59,332 --> 00:23:59,827
Yeah.

405
00:24:00,115 --> 00:24:02,235
Focaccia tastes great with gum syrup on it.

406
00:24:02,306 --> 00:24:04,370
That sounds so good! I'll have one, too!

407
00:24:04,622 --> 00:24:05,645
Oh, and also...

408
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:09,011
a Chorizo Prosciutto!

409
00:24:09,036 --> 00:24:10,393
Is that your finishing move?
