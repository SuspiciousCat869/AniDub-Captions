1
00:00:10,171 --> 00:00:10,703
Hey...

2
00:00:11,794 --> 00:00:13,091
Did something happen?

3
00:00:15,197 --> 00:00:16,443
Nothing I can recall.

4
00:00:16,811 --> 00:00:18,076
I would say if anything...

5
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:20,704
there's so little happening it's like watching grass grow.

6
00:00:20,849 --> 00:00:23,231
They say "Inscrutable are the ways of Heaven,"

7
00:00:23,266 --> 00:00:26,677
but it would probably go better if
it said "Sometimes things just happen."

8
00:00:28,124 --> 00:00:29,759
What's going on, Big Bro?

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:32,319
Uh... let's see...

10
00:00:33,124 --> 00:00:34,627
Nope, nothing's up at all.

11
00:00:37,887 --> 00:00:38,932
I think I know.

12
00:00:38,957 --> 00:00:40,345
Know what? The muffin man?

13
00:00:40,657 --> 00:00:43,727
You always just sit there and
try to tell me nothing is going on,

14
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:47,047
but you say that even more when you aren't doing so well.

15
00:00:47,815 --> 00:00:48,594
Oh, really?

16
00:00:50,165 --> 00:00:51,044
Big Brother...?

17
00:00:51,433 --> 00:00:51,924
Hm?

18
00:00:51,989 --> 00:00:54,377
Did something happen with Yukino and Yui?

19
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,517
Did they come and say something to you?

20
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:00,798
I just thought that might be the problem.

21
00:01:01,806 --> 00:01:02,452
Really...

22
00:01:03,873 --> 00:01:05,597
Well then... did you do something?

23
00:01:06,287 --> 00:01:08,956
The assumption that I did something is simply ridiculous.

24
00:01:08,999 --> 00:01:13,250
Even if you aren't aware of it there's
still a high probability that you did something.

25
00:01:13,507 --> 00:01:14,628
You have no choice.

26
00:01:14,653 --> 00:01:16,405
You've gotta tell me everything now.

27
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,176
That's easier said than done.

28
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:24,626
It's really nothing.

29
00:01:24,979 --> 00:01:26,012
Oh, come on!

30
00:01:26,623 --> 00:01:28,370
Just tell me what happened okay?

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:30,157
God, you're persistent.

32
00:01:30,463 --> 00:01:31,387
Just back off.

33
00:01:33,234 --> 00:01:35,748
What?! Why are you talking like that to me?

34
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:37,522
I just said what I usually say.

35
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:40,425
Which is, you were being to persistent and annoying.

36
00:01:43,421 --> 00:01:43,857
Fine.

37
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:46,863
Forget I asked.

38
00:01:47,611 --> 00:01:48,652
That's fine by me.

39
00:01:54,889 --> 00:01:57,113
I'm leaving, so make sure you lock the door.

40
00:01:57,265 --> 00:01:57,853
Okay.

41
00:02:02,551 --> 00:02:04,580
I know something happened!

42
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:45,452
Morning!

43
00:03:45,705 --> 00:03:46,424
Morning!

44
00:03:49,362 --> 00:03:53,017
<i>Is this the world that wants to
always keep things just the way they are?</i>

45
00:03:54,636 --> 00:03:55,756
Morning, Hachiman.

46
00:03:58,601 --> 00:04:00,126
Yea... morning.

47
00:04:00,476 --> 00:04:00,990
Huh?

48
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,801
Hm? What is it?

49
00:04:02,986 --> 00:04:04,279
It's nothing really.

50
00:04:04,347 --> 00:04:06,626
I was just thinking how normal your greeting was.

51
00:04:06,651 --> 00:04:08,761
Yeah... I guess, you're right, huh?

52
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,207
It's normal.

53
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:37,771
<i>So bitter.</i>

54
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:03,096
And did you know that the crepe shop
by the station is actually really good?

55
00:05:03,644 --> 00:05:04,544
Really?

56
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:06,775
We should go sometime, Yukinon!

57
00:05:06,861 --> 00:05:08,181
Chocolate banana is the...

58
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,387
So you came.

59
00:05:22,033 --> 00:05:23,194
Yeah I guess so.

60
00:05:36,309 --> 00:05:39,252
Hey... by the way, everyone was normal today.

61
00:05:40,571 --> 00:05:43,853
You know... I mean... everyone...

62
00:05:44,701 --> 00:05:45,481
That's true.

63
00:05:46,831 --> 00:05:49,144
Just looking at them, it was like nothing had happened.

64
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:52,881
If it's true, then that's good.

65
00:05:55,213 --> 00:05:58,249
You're right... but I was totally on pins and needles.

66
00:05:58,315 --> 00:06:01,306
I guess it really wasn't something
I needed to worry about was it!

67
00:06:02,203 --> 00:06:05,300
It was all... completely... normal.

68
00:06:07,788 --> 00:06:10,443
I just don't understand what they're all thinking anymore.

69
00:06:11,369 --> 00:06:14,327
No one does... from the start we had no real idea.

70
00:06:14,385 --> 00:06:16,032
There was no way for us to know...

71
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:18,067
Even if we know each other...

72
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:21,002
understanding one another is a totally different problem.

73
00:06:21,655 --> 00:06:23,526
I wouldn't really worry about it too much.

74
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:26,376
I also think it'd be best if we just went back to normal.

75
00:06:28,855 --> 00:06:30,504
We should go back to normal.

76
00:06:31,334 --> 00:06:31,865
Yeah.

77
00:06:32,829 --> 00:06:34,253
Normal... huh.

78
00:06:35,149 --> 00:06:35,606
Huh...

79
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:39,883
Right... so I suppose that is
what you're considering normal then.

80
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:45,355
So you're saying... you're not going to change?

81
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,711
You are just... uh...

82
00:06:51,488 --> 00:06:52,061
I...

83
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,226
Yukinon!

84
00:06:54,698 --> 00:06:55,952
Uh... So, um...

85
00:06:56,428 --> 00:06:57,006
Come on.

86
00:06:59,436 --> 00:07:00,803
Just me, coming in!

87
00:07:01,256 --> 00:07:03,042
I want to ask a favor of you guys.

88
00:07:05,181 --> 00:07:07,323
Hmh... Did something happen here?

89
00:07:07,356 --> 00:07:10,427
Nope, nothing. So, did you need something from us?

90
00:07:10,667 --> 00:07:12,699
Right! You can come in!

91
00:07:13,213 --> 00:07:15,225
There's something I want to get your help with...

92
00:07:15,722 --> 00:07:17,345
Oh, Shiromeguri...

93
00:07:20,237 --> 00:07:21,937
Oh, hey there, Iroha!

94
00:07:22,063 --> 00:07:24,407
Hey Yui! Hi everyone!

95
00:07:24,474 --> 00:07:26,700
Yahallo! Long time no see!

96
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:36,357
Wow so you're a candidate for student council president?

97
00:07:36,557 --> 00:07:37,451
Yes.

98
00:07:38,691 --> 00:07:42,372
Um... I bet you think that I'm not
really cut out to be the president, huh?

99
00:07:42,397 --> 00:07:43,985
Uh, no, not really...

100
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,831
I know people say all sorts of things about me.

101
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,084
Like I seem kind of dumb or slow.

102
00:07:49,348 --> 00:07:51,716
So then, what's the problem you're bringing us?

103
00:07:51,741 --> 00:07:55,229
As you can see Isshiki is running
for student council president, but...

104
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,930
let's see, how should I go about saying this...

105
00:07:58,256 --> 00:08:00,156
We want it so she doesn't get elected.

106
00:08:00,181 --> 00:08:00,687
Hm...

107
00:08:01,332 --> 00:08:05,620
So, um... you're saying that you don't
want to be the student council president?

108
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:07,234
Yes, that's right.

109
00:08:07,769 --> 00:08:09,463
Then why are you even running for it?

110
00:08:09,495 --> 00:08:13,304
Well, uh... I didn't exactly enter myself as a candidate.

111
00:08:13,475 --> 00:08:14,992
Someone did it behind my back.

112
00:08:15,299 --> 00:08:17,080
<i>Huh? Is she a celebrity?</i>

113
00:08:17,447 --> 00:08:20,123
I would say that I'm pretty noticeable in a bad way.

114
00:08:20,148 --> 00:08:24,092
<i>It's like that... It does seem
like she'd be hated by other girls.</i>

115
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,956
<i>It was the same in junior high...</i>

116
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:29,648
<i>You already had boys wrapped around
your little finger, like a juggler.</i>

117
00:08:30,474 --> 00:08:33,076
Even as a joke, this is pretty complicated.

118
00:08:33,989 --> 00:08:37,481
To become a candidate, you had to
be nominated by at least 30 people.

119
00:08:38,467 --> 00:08:40,617
That many? You got a lot, huh?

120
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:43,357
I'll be talking to these students who did this, of course.

121
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:45,703
If you don't want to do it, then just drop out of it.

122
00:08:46,239 --> 00:08:47,913
I mean, there's nothing else you can do.

123
00:08:48,047 --> 00:08:52,190
Well... you see the problem is Isshiki
is the only candidate right now...

124
00:08:52,215 --> 00:08:54,292
Then she needs a vote of no confidence, right?

125
00:08:54,484 --> 00:08:58,957
But it would be so lame to lose an election
like that! There's no way I could do that.

126
00:09:00,776 --> 00:09:03,207
Have you decided on who will give your campaign speech?

127
00:09:03,817 --> 00:09:04,733
I haven't.

128
00:09:05,021 --> 00:09:06,521
Great, this will be easy then.

129
00:09:06,837 --> 00:09:08,612
Why's that? What do you mean?

130
00:09:09,118 --> 00:09:12,346
Worst case scenario, if it
comes to a vote of no confidence,

131
00:09:12,371 --> 00:09:16,376
we can lose the election and Isshiki will
be able to extract herself without any damage.

132
00:09:16,466 --> 00:09:21,379
Which would be a good thing because then everyone would
know. Isshiki didn't cause herself to lose the election.

133
00:09:21,921 --> 00:09:23,307
Can you do something like that?

134
00:09:23,364 --> 00:09:28,626
No one will blame Isshiki if there is a lack of confidence
in her due to a poorly delivered campaign speech.

135
00:09:39,627 --> 00:09:42,611
And who do you suppose we get to make that kind of speech?

136
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:43,886
Hm, Hikki?

137
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:48,509
I don't think... I like that.

138
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:49,854
It's best if...

139
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:52,579
Whoever is capable should be the one who goes up there.

140
00:09:53,058 --> 00:09:54,807
Well I won't approve you doing it that way.

141
00:09:57,765 --> 00:09:58,688
What's your reason?

142
00:09:59,065 --> 00:09:59,965
Because...

143
00:10:01,737 --> 00:10:03,276
it'd be too unreliable.

144
00:10:03,895 --> 00:10:08,561
Moreover... a horrible speech that creates a lack
of confidence in Isshiki could cause her trouble.

145
00:10:11,002 --> 00:10:15,237
Even if that created a lack of confidence, do
you think they would bother doing another election?

146
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:16,245
That's why...

147
00:10:17,095 --> 00:10:19,182
interest in the student council is so low.

148
00:10:19,432 --> 00:10:22,922
No one would care if they announced the
results without making the number of votes public.

149
00:10:23,094 --> 00:10:24,847
So, see there could be any number...

150
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,388
Yukinoshita.

151
00:10:30,025 --> 00:10:32,233
Slip of the tongue. I retract that.

152
00:10:32,275 --> 00:10:32,698
Uh...

153
00:10:33,886 --> 00:10:35,279
The only other method would be...

154
00:10:35,672 --> 00:10:37,827
to put our support behind another candidate.

155
00:10:38,113 --> 00:10:39,675
If someone else wanted to do it...

156
00:10:40,227 --> 00:10:42,735
explain why they haven't already signed up to run?

157
00:10:44,821 --> 00:10:49,022
I know, we could try to choose someone
that would go up there and do it for us...

158
00:10:51,532 --> 00:10:53,540
Looks like we won't figure it out today.

159
00:10:54,038 --> 00:10:55,234
Let's try again later.

160
00:10:55,561 --> 00:10:56,333
Okay.

161
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:58,761
Ms. Hiratsuka.

162
00:10:59,613 --> 00:11:00,058
Hm?

163
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:02,784
Can I please have a moment of your time?

164
00:11:02,981 --> 00:11:03,437
Hm.

165
00:11:06,146 --> 00:11:08,192
What do you think the outcome would be as of now?

166
00:11:08,742 --> 00:11:09,219
Huh?

167
00:11:09,681 --> 00:11:10,798
What outcome is that?

168
00:11:10,943 --> 00:11:13,343
For a competition on who can better serve people...

169
00:11:13,535 --> 00:11:15,857
and which of us can better solve someone's problems.

170
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:19,291
The winner orders the loser to do whatever they want.

171
00:11:19,316 --> 00:11:20,603
Wait, this is what we're doing?

172
00:11:20,813 --> 00:11:22,206
Th-that's correct.

173
00:11:22,584 --> 00:11:26,168
There have been situations where
everyone worked together to solve a task.

174
00:11:26,206 --> 00:11:27,865
On that front you're all doing well.

175
00:11:32,106 --> 00:11:35,180
If you want to know where you three stand individually...

176
00:11:35,307 --> 00:11:38,493
I guess I can tell you something
at my own discretion and bias.

177
00:11:38,518 --> 00:11:39,277
That's fine.

178
00:11:41,305 --> 00:11:44,264
Well if I were to only judge by the results, then..

179
00:11:44,575 --> 00:11:46,244
Hikigaya is one step ahead.

180
00:11:46,757 --> 00:11:49,298
But if I take into account the process and progress,

181
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:51,024
Yukinoshita is on top.

182
00:11:52,054 --> 00:11:56,501
However, in either case, without Yuigahama's
contributions this would be impossible...

183
00:11:57,320 --> 00:11:59,722
So then... the match isn't decided yet.

184
00:12:00,124 --> 00:12:01,193
That sounds about right.

185
00:12:01,556 --> 00:12:05,113
I see... so that means even
though our opinions are different...

186
00:12:05,207 --> 00:12:06,566
there's no problem, right?

187
00:12:06,608 --> 00:12:08,248
I don't know what you mean by that?

188
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:10,347
I mean that it's not necessary.

189
00:12:10,372 --> 00:12:12,278
We don't need to use the same methods.

190
00:12:12,831 --> 00:12:13,531
Ah...

191
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:17,526
So then there's no real reason for us to
strain ourselves to make our opinions match.

192
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:21,549
Well then... what will the club do until this is resolved?

193
00:12:21,797 --> 00:12:23,332
People can still participate.

194
00:12:23,748 --> 00:12:24,994
That sounds reasonable.

195
00:12:25,305 --> 00:12:25,878
Uh...

196
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:27,871
Remember, Hikigaya...

197
00:12:27,963 --> 00:12:30,677
the thing you and I hate the most is being superficial.

198
00:12:34,102 --> 00:12:35,268
Did something happen?

199
00:12:35,758 --> 00:12:36,239
Nope.

200
00:12:37,622 --> 00:12:38,207
Really...

201
00:12:39,057 --> 00:12:39,639
Okay.

202
00:12:40,666 --> 00:12:42,168
You know you're a nice guy, right?

203
00:12:42,878 --> 00:12:44,771
You've helped quite a lot of people here.

204
00:12:45,296 --> 00:12:46,899
Don't say that, it's not true.

205
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:51,817
I know it doesn't seem like
it, but I do show favoritism here.

206
00:12:51,842 --> 00:12:53,899
Yeah how's that workin' out
with you being a teacher and all?

207
00:12:53,930 --> 00:12:55,930
I praise and encourage all students.

208
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,157
You know I don't really buy that load of crap at all.

209
00:12:58,822 --> 00:13:00,530
Why, because I also scold you?

210
00:13:01,301 --> 00:13:05,180
Well going by your methods, when you meet
someone that you actually want to help...

211
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:07,086
you're not gonna be able to help them.

212
00:13:28,029 --> 00:13:29,363
Thank you for your business!

213
00:13:29,468 --> 00:13:31,866
That's not a face I see very often.

214
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:43,073
Don't just up and run away from me. That's rude of you.

215
00:13:49,226 --> 00:13:50,281
Hikigaya.

216
00:13:50,428 --> 00:13:50,922
Yes.

217
00:13:51,022 --> 00:13:53,159
Why don't you tell me something interesting?

218
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,131
Just look at that super hateful reaction!

219
00:13:57,315 --> 00:13:59,106
Yea, just as I expected!

220
00:14:00,953 --> 00:14:02,912
So... is Yukino doing okay?

221
00:14:02,937 --> 00:14:05,067
Well, she isn't any different than usual.

222
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:07,292
Really... that's great then.

223
00:14:08,077 --> 00:14:10,299
So... has there been any progress?

224
00:14:10,855 --> 00:14:11,326
What?

225
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:13,033
Didn't you go on the school trip?

226
00:14:13,506 --> 00:14:14,840
You sure are in the know.

227
00:14:14,919 --> 00:14:16,908
The souvenirs arrived at the house.

228
00:14:17,111 --> 00:14:18,913
She used a delivery service?

229
00:14:19,516 --> 00:14:21,353
She probably didn't want to see me.

230
00:14:21,781 --> 00:14:23,945
And yet she still bought you all souvenirs.

231
00:14:24,357 --> 00:14:25,078
She's loyal.

232
00:14:25,141 --> 00:14:27,896
Maybe... but I don't think that's really the case.

233
00:14:28,115 --> 00:14:28,528
Huh?

234
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:31,966
She actually hates us... but she doesn't want to be hated.

235
00:14:33,631 --> 00:14:36,321
So now that the big events seem to be all over with...

236
00:14:36,363 --> 00:14:38,573
all that's left are the entrance exams huh?

237
00:14:39,033 --> 00:14:40,392
Don't you find that boring?

238
00:14:40,612 --> 00:14:41,741
No, not really.

239
00:14:42,523 --> 00:14:45,727
Don't forget there are also still the
student council elections and whatnot.

240
00:14:46,115 --> 00:14:47,157
Oh right...

241
00:14:47,423 --> 00:14:50,126
So Meguri's finally retiring her role, huh?

242
00:14:50,235 --> 00:14:55,056
She is Meguri after all. Did she request for
you to make Yukino the student council president?

243
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,413
Uh, no, she actually didn't.

244
00:14:57,753 --> 00:14:59,945
What? That's boring.

245
00:15:01,645 --> 00:15:04,156
So Yukino won't become the student council president?

246
00:15:04,346 --> 00:15:05,091
Probably not.

247
00:15:05,685 --> 00:15:06,397
Hmm...

248
00:15:06,571 --> 00:15:08,085
Um... what about it?

249
00:15:08,345 --> 00:15:11,622
Hmh? Well... I didn't do it either, I guess.

250
00:15:14,184 --> 00:15:15,384
That's pretty boring.

251
00:15:18,015 --> 00:15:18,449
Uh...

252
00:15:21,671 --> 00:15:23,092
Huh? Hikigaya?

253
00:15:23,715 --> 00:15:25,508
Whoa, I haven't seen you in forever!

254
00:15:25,533 --> 00:15:27,164
What a rare encounter to have.

255
00:15:27,426 --> 00:15:28,528
Orimoto...?

256
00:15:29,783 --> 00:15:34,389
<i>I really thought junior high school classmates had
been thrown out of the innermost recesses of my memories.</i>

257
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:39,037
<i>But Kaori Orimoto's name had easily come to me.</i>

258
00:15:41,256 --> 00:15:41,874
Wait...

259
00:15:42,301 --> 00:15:44,094
You go to Soubu High School, right?

260
00:15:44,268 --> 00:15:45,502
Uh... I do.

261
00:15:45,682 --> 00:15:47,782
Oh, so you're really smart then, huh?

262
00:15:48,065 --> 00:15:49,108
I didn't know that.

263
00:15:49,405 --> 00:15:52,259
I mean, it's not like you
really talked to anyone back then.

264
00:15:52,599 --> 00:15:52,997
Uh?

265
00:15:54,583 --> 00:15:55,620
This your girlfriend?

266
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,677
No, she's not...

267
00:15:56,702 --> 00:15:59,401
Of course not. I knew that'd be pretty impossible.

268
00:16:01,238 --> 00:16:03,384
<i>I'm forcing a smile, this is gross.</i>

269
00:16:03,836 --> 00:16:06,316
This girl is actually one of your friends?

270
00:16:06,341 --> 00:16:08,645
<i>Am I imagining it, or did that sound more like,</i>

271
00:16:08,731 --> 00:16:10,240
<i>"Did you really have friends?"</i>

272
00:16:10,637 --> 00:16:12,556
She's an old junior high school classmate.

273
00:16:12,626 --> 00:16:14,188
I'm Kaori Orimoto.

274
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:15,427
Hmm...

275
00:16:16,140 --> 00:16:18,722
Hi... My name is Haruno Yukinoshita..

276
00:16:18,877 --> 00:16:20,050
I'm Hikigaya's...

277
00:16:20,967 --> 00:16:21,537
Hey...

278
00:16:21,664 --> 00:16:22,058
Hm?

279
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,261
Well, what would you say we are, Hikigaya?

280
00:16:24,286 --> 00:16:26,264
Uh... I don't think I really know.

281
00:16:26,373 --> 00:16:29,201
It'd be weird to tell people
that we're actually "friends".

282
00:16:29,273 --> 00:16:31,070
Maybe more like a big sister...

283
00:16:31,473 --> 00:16:34,946
I know! How about we just tell them I'm your girlfriend?

284
00:16:35,246 --> 00:16:37,885
How about we just plainly say
that you're an alum from school?

285
00:16:38,113 --> 00:16:39,791
You're so coldhearted to me!

286
00:16:40,995 --> 00:16:43,130
So you two went to the same school together, huh?

287
00:16:43,290 --> 00:16:45,232
You have any interesting stories?

288
00:16:45,302 --> 00:16:45,759
Huh?

289
00:16:45,823 --> 00:16:47,586
Oh, a love story?!

290
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:50,932
I want to hear all about young Hikigaya's love life.

291
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:53,827
Uh... now that you mention it.

292
00:16:54,232 --> 00:16:56,777
Hikigaya did ask me out once in junior high!

293
00:16:56,802 --> 00:16:57,803
No way!

294
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,316
I so have to hear that!

295
00:17:01,662 --> 00:17:04,999
I was so surprised because we
hadn't talked at all until then.

296
00:17:05,926 --> 00:17:07,012
<i>We had talked...</i>

297
00:17:07,165 --> 00:17:08,483
<i>We texted each other.</i>

298
00:17:09,196 --> 00:17:12,006
<i>We traded addresses out of pity or compassion...</i>

299
00:17:12,807 --> 00:17:15,521
<i>I used all sorts of trivial reasons to text her,</i>

300
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,253
<i>and waited to see if a text would ever come or not...</i>

301
00:17:18,848 --> 00:17:21,857
<i>But I bet she didn't know or even
remember that those things were happening.</i>

302
00:17:22,590 --> 00:17:25,310
Wow, Hikigaya asked you out, huh?

303
00:17:25,776 --> 00:17:27,643
Well, it was a really long time ago.

304
00:17:27,703 --> 00:17:30,724
Yeah, it was a long time ago
and it doesn't really matter now.

305
00:17:31,764 --> 00:17:33,043
O-oh yeah!

306
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,301
You know a guy named Hayama at Soubu?

307
00:17:35,403 --> 00:17:37,669
Hm? Uh... more or less.

308
00:17:37,841 --> 00:17:38,795
For real?!

309
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:41,494
Chika, he can introduce you to Hayama!

310
00:17:41,757 --> 00:17:44,025
Huh? Uh, no thanks.

311
00:17:44,187 --> 00:17:45,906
No, he's not really a friend.

312
00:17:45,931 --> 00:17:47,510
Yeah... I guess you're right.

313
00:17:47,535 --> 00:17:49,156
I can see that not happening.

314
00:17:49,299 --> 00:17:51,438
Hmm, this seems like fun...

315
00:17:51,748 --> 00:17:54,266
Hi... Big Sis will introduce you to him!

316
00:17:54,632 --> 00:17:55,066
Huh?

317
00:17:58,411 --> 00:18:00,817
Hey Hayato? Are you able to come out now?

318
00:18:00,842 --> 00:18:01,859
Or rather, just come.

319
00:18:01,924 --> 00:18:02,408
We're at the donut shop near the station.

320
00:18:02,432 --> 00:18:04,039
What do you think you're doing right now?

321
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,279
Bye, Hayama! I'll send you a text later, okay?!

322
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,952
Holy crap. He was so cool.

323
00:18:17,698 --> 00:18:19,104
Why did you do that Haruno?

324
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:21,166
Because it seemed like such fun.

325
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,634
Not that again?

326
00:18:22,754 --> 00:18:24,983
And I don't get why Hikigaya's here too?

327
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:26,804
He has nothing to do with this does he?

328
00:18:26,829 --> 00:18:28,057
That's not true!

329
00:18:28,082 --> 00:18:32,358
Hikigaya actually liked the girl with
the perm back in his junior high days.

330
00:18:33,742 --> 00:18:36,501
I wonder what kind of face Yukino would make if she knew?

331
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,961
Well, that was a good way to waste some time tonight.

332
00:18:40,158 --> 00:18:42,100
I guess I will head out now guys.

333
00:18:43,474 --> 00:18:45,568
Thanks for hanging out with me, Hikigaya.

334
00:18:45,593 --> 00:18:46,354
Bye now.

335
00:18:57,522 --> 00:19:00,050
It looks like Haruno has taken a liking to you.

336
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,110
Huh? Are you stupid?

337
00:19:02,329 --> 00:19:03,833
She's just making fun of me.

338
00:19:03,970 --> 00:19:07,530
She doesn't poke her nose into the
business of people she has no interest in.

339
00:19:08,922 --> 00:19:10,270
She wouldn't do anything.

340
00:19:10,652 --> 00:19:12,802
She just smothers and kills the things she likes...

341
00:19:13,381 --> 00:19:15,657
or thoroughly crush the things that she hates.

342
00:19:16,814 --> 00:19:17,636
That's scary.

343
00:19:27,599 --> 00:19:28,054
Huh?

344
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:30,034
Good morning there!

345
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:30,754
Hey.

346
00:19:36,832 --> 00:19:39,558
Are you planning on going to the club room today?

347
00:19:39,590 --> 00:19:40,711
Nope, I'm not.

348
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:42,669
Oh.. Okay, then.

349
00:19:44,573 --> 00:19:45,128
Um...

350
00:19:45,835 --> 00:19:48,934
We thought that we should talk to
Iroha a bit more this afternoon...

351
00:19:49,444 --> 00:19:52,086
and it seems like we'll decide on a strategy.

352
00:19:53,752 --> 00:19:58,451
I didn't... I didn't want you to think we
were doing anything without you knowing about it.

353
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:02,114
Well, if it's just to listen then I'll come.

354
00:20:06,417 --> 00:20:09,332
<i>I wonder how long it's been
since I've openly opposed Yukino.</i>

355
00:20:10,398 --> 00:20:11,604
<i>It's the same now, too.</i>

356
00:20:12,817 --> 00:20:15,441
<i>Yukinoshita will reject my method of doing things,</i>

357
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,304
<i>but if it's the same, there is no problem.</i>

358
00:20:21,340 --> 00:20:22,819
You actually really came!

359
00:20:25,003 --> 00:20:26,227
Then let us begin now.

360
00:20:27,664 --> 00:20:30,901
It seems like the best option is
for us to find another candidate...

361
00:20:31,136 --> 00:20:32,955
then as their running opposite to you,

362
00:20:32,980 --> 00:20:36,203
you'll now have the chance to lose
peacefully against them in a run-off.

363
00:20:36,609 --> 00:20:38,151
I think you're right about that.

364
00:20:38,244 --> 00:20:42,228
But personally, I think it would be good
if I could lose against an awesome person.

365
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:46,710
I thought about the contents of the commitment
pledge and campaign speech for the candidate.

366
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:49,990
When you say you thought of a commitment pledge,

367
00:20:50,142 --> 00:20:52,176
you mean the candidate would be a total puppet.

368
00:20:52,655 --> 00:20:53,985
But is that really okay?

369
00:20:54,354 --> 00:20:58,047
If that person is elected, then what will
you do about managing the student council?

370
00:20:58,501 --> 00:21:02,246
So then we just have to make sure to
find someone who can do the job properly.

371
00:21:02,271 --> 00:21:04,193
The hurdle has been raised even more.

372
00:21:04,690 --> 00:21:07,123
If we're thinking about the future then there's no point,

373
00:21:07,157 --> 00:21:08,978
plus it's not a very clever move.

374
00:21:09,178 --> 00:21:12,295
Then... what is the point to your method?

375
00:21:16,153 --> 00:21:20,694
In this scenario, she can avoid the worst
outcome and when she loses the vote of no confidence,

376
00:21:20,719 --> 00:21:23,014
she can then drop out of the re-election process...

377
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,280
"In this scenario..."?

378
00:21:24,582 --> 00:21:25,908
No. You're wrong.

379
00:21:26,204 --> 00:21:28,905
You always go avoiding the problem like this.

380
00:21:33,655 --> 00:21:36,077
So what? Did it cause any problems?

381
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:41,035
Earlier didn't you call this
type of superficiality meaningless?

382
00:21:43,467 --> 00:21:44,972
You really don't want to change?

383
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:45,512
No.

384
00:21:47,681 --> 00:21:48,924
B-but, hey..

385
00:21:49,723 --> 00:21:50,419
Um...

386
00:21:56,393 --> 00:21:57,338
I'm heading home.

387
00:23:41,403 --> 00:23:42,300
Hey!

388
00:23:43,052 --> 00:23:44,929
I wonder if this will be okay.

389
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:48,937
I mean I would feel a lot better if
a good person ran against me, but...

390
00:23:49,202 --> 00:23:51,118
So then someone like Hayama would be good.

391
00:23:51,143 --> 00:23:53,018
No way, it can't be Hayama!

392
00:23:53,043 --> 00:23:54,880
If worse comes to worst, I'll fix it.

393
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:56,581
Thanks so much!

394
00:23:57,071 --> 00:23:59,085
No one really wants to help me.

395
00:23:59,291 --> 00:24:02,011
I can only depend on you guys in the Service Club.

396
00:24:02,637 --> 00:24:03,048
Oh!

397
00:24:03,879 --> 00:24:06,124
I have got to get to practice now.

398
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:07,979
Well, I'm counting on you!
