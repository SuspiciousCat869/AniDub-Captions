1
00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:08,383
Why did I go and embarrass myself like that?

2
00:00:11,943 --> 00:00:15,165
<i>I wanna die! I'm gonna die from embarrassment!!</i>

3
00:00:15,305 --> 00:00:16,912
<i>I don't wanna go to school tomorrow!</i>

4
00:00:16,937 --> 00:00:19,000
<i>I'm so dumb! So frickin' dumb!</i>

5
00:00:19,163 --> 00:00:20,647
<i>Idiot! Idiot!</i>

6
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:29,715
<i>Guess I'll die.</i>

7
00:00:32,432 --> 00:00:34,150
What's wrong with you big bro?

8
00:00:34,725 --> 00:00:35,738
Leave me alone.

9
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,363
Your big bro is kinda having
an identity crisis right now...

10
00:00:42,314 --> 00:00:43,904
Hey you on the floor there...

11
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,550
Identity crisis? What?

12
00:00:49,283 --> 00:00:53,923
So it turns out that people who go on and on
about their "individuality" actually don't have one...

13
00:00:53,989 --> 00:00:57,789
Plus, how can you call it an "identity"
when you can change it super easily?

14
00:00:59,099 --> 00:01:01,203
Komachi, what's with your choice of words?

15
00:01:01,228 --> 00:01:03,954
It's so rude. And the look on your face is weird.

16
00:01:04,848 --> 00:01:06,464
I was pretending to be you!

17
00:01:06,504 --> 00:01:07,723
I don't sound like that.

18
00:01:10,078 --> 00:01:12,498
I seriously don't know what's happened to you...

19
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:17,170
But there's no way for you to
fix your twisted personality,

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,547
it's too late. You're such trash brother, so trashy!

21
00:01:22,468 --> 00:01:25,747
Then again... I guess that I
really like you just the way you are.

22
00:01:26,097 --> 00:01:29,375
Ah! I got a whole mess of points for that little comment!

23
00:01:32,423 --> 00:01:34,018
Thanks for that little sis.

24
00:01:34,551 --> 00:01:36,877
You know, I like the way I am, too.

25
00:01:37,646 --> 00:01:39,428
I got a whole mess of points for THAT one!

26
00:01:40,876 --> 00:01:42,335
What the heck bro?

27
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:27,729
Hi Hikigaya.

28
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,462
Uh, hey.

29
00:03:50,051 --> 00:03:52,053
Uh.. So that...

30
00:03:55,815 --> 00:03:58,487
So that... that meeting for today...

31
00:03:59,567 --> 00:04:02,329
Could you please share with me the
place and time we need to meet up?

32
00:04:03,222 --> 00:04:04,922
Oh yeah... Of course.

33
00:04:07,989 --> 00:04:10,683
Would it be ok if I tell you when Yuigahama gets here?

34
00:04:11,405 --> 00:04:13,982
That's fine. Then you don't have repeat it.

35
00:04:19,778 --> 00:04:20,972
Yahallo!!

36
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:22,077
Hey.

37
00:04:22,787 --> 00:04:23,877
Hi Yuigahama.

38
00:04:34,037 --> 00:04:35,085
Too close.

39
00:04:39,301 --> 00:04:40,937
Hey.. Yuigahama...

40
00:04:41,319 --> 00:04:43,212
do you mind moving away a little bit?

41
00:04:45,136 --> 00:04:47,142
Yeah.. Sorry about that.

42
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,659
I... didn't mean anything...

43
00:04:55,135 --> 00:04:56,308
Yahallo!

44
00:04:56,528 --> 00:04:57,817
We're here to help, Iroha!

45
00:04:58,529 --> 00:05:00,720
Seems like your situation isn't going well.

46
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,506
It isn't going well!

47
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:07,660
Problem here?

48
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,427
No... not at all.

49
00:05:09,452 --> 00:05:10,453
Uh, it's fine..

50
00:05:10,548 --> 00:05:11,848
There's no problem here.

51
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:19,150
'Kay, let's just brace ourselves for the inevitable.

52
00:05:22,154 --> 00:05:22,767
Hey!

53
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,695
Look.. We have some new faces joining us today.

54
00:05:26,112 --> 00:05:29,485
Nice to meet you! I'm Kaihin
High's Student council president...

55
00:05:30,207 --> 00:05:31,637
That was so terrible...

56
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:34,084
Listening to them irritated me...

57
00:05:34,379 --> 00:05:35,220
Totally.

58
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:37,836
Ok then, what should we do?

59
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,362
Don't know.

60
00:05:40,922 --> 00:05:42,627
Hmmm... Well first..

61
00:05:42,652 --> 00:05:45,896
I guess we should actually
figure out what we can do.. Right?

62
00:05:51,803 --> 00:05:53,613
It looks like you've all finished your work.

63
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:58,185
I don't think that we had any Japanese assignments.

64
00:06:00,784 --> 00:06:03,079
Then... What'd you come to talk to me about?

65
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:06,507
So, that means we start with a budget, right?

66
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,340
You guys have no idea whatsoever
what Christmas is, do you?

67
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:11,104
What?

68
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,868
I'll show you what it's all about.

69
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:14,969
Ta-da!

70
00:06:15,589 --> 00:06:16,736
Look what I have!

71
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:18,337
Huh?

72
00:06:18,917 --> 00:06:21,685
Why do you have those on hand? And four of them...

73
00:06:21,786 --> 00:06:23,871
Cause I won these at a wedding reception.

74
00:06:24,262 --> 00:06:25,444
Twice actually...

75
00:06:25,911 --> 00:06:27,770
I was told "You can go by yourself!"

76
00:06:28,544 --> 00:06:29,830
Two times actually...

77
00:06:29,855 --> 00:06:31,529
<i>What is she trying to tell us?</i>

78
00:06:31,703 --> 00:06:33,824
<i>Don't you know after going 4 times by yourself,</i>

79
00:06:33,849 --> 00:06:36,548
<i>it becomes so much fun you'll even pay to go a fifth time?</i>

80
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:40,282
<i>And if things don't go well but
you go a sixth time, I'll go with you!</i>

81
00:06:40,601 --> 00:06:42,806
<i>Seriously, someone hurry up and marry her already!</i>

82
00:06:43,712 --> 00:06:46,438
You guys take these tickets, go do a bit more studying.

83
00:06:46,463 --> 00:06:47,807
And then use them as your breather...

84
00:06:47,832 --> 00:06:48,861
Are you sure?

85
00:06:48,886 --> 00:06:50,699
Oh my gosh, thank you so much!

86
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:53,007
Why go now, when it's so incredibly crowded?

87
00:06:53,118 --> 00:06:55,146
I know... I don't really want...

88
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:57,694
Huuuh? No, it's fine we're gonna go!

89
00:06:58,183 --> 00:07:00,210
Oh, and Pan the Panda!!

90
00:07:00,543 --> 00:07:02,487
They've got Pan's Bamboo fight there!

91
00:07:04,688 --> 00:07:06,170
We can go at any time.

92
00:07:06,195 --> 00:07:08,402
I don't see why we have to go when it will be busy.

93
00:07:08,625 --> 00:07:11,766
Come on, please! They've got all
the Christmas decorations up now!

94
00:07:11,801 --> 00:07:12,408
No.

95
00:07:13,575 --> 00:07:16,409
"Bamboo Fight" uses the same theme all year-round.

96
00:07:16,503 --> 00:07:20,567
Actually.. Their theme attraction has
always been held in the highest regard.

97
00:07:20,609 --> 00:07:21,135
Oh...

98
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,419
You're well-informed.

99
00:07:23,665 --> 00:07:24,490
It's just that...

100
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:26,384
things that big are common knowledge.

101
00:07:26,817 --> 00:07:28,652
Yukinon, we should go!

102
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:29,792
Absolutely not.

103
00:07:30,795 --> 00:07:33,781
Come on... I want you and I to go together.

104
00:07:34,314 --> 00:07:37,295
You know.. Since things have been strained recently...

105
00:07:37,547 --> 00:07:38,856
and these are a gift...

106
00:07:40,811 --> 00:07:41,771
Merchandise.

107
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,402
Wha?

108
00:07:43,872 --> 00:07:44,609
The Panda...

109
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:47,520
Won't they have Christmas. Pan's merchandise right now?

110
00:07:48,262 --> 00:07:52,628
I really wanted to get something like that
for my little sister... as her Christmas gift.

111
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:55,926
That's great! Let's all choose something together!

112
00:07:57,513 --> 00:07:58,959
Well, if that's the case..

113
00:07:59,392 --> 00:08:00,685
I guess we have to go.

114
00:08:02,417 --> 00:08:04,977
So then... Are all four of us gonna go?

115
00:08:05,959 --> 00:08:10,469
Actually, I have a season pass for
myself... we won't need one of the tickets.

116
00:08:10,494 --> 00:08:13,486
Oh! Then we should get one more person to come, right?

117
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:15,299
Who are you thinkin' of?

118
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:18,069
It's. A. Su. Prise!

119
00:08:22,665 --> 00:08:23,234
Hey.

120
00:08:27,259 --> 00:08:29,204
Huh? Hikio is here too?

121
00:08:29,229 --> 00:08:31,082
Hikio! That's super funny!

122
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:32,460
But he's Hikitani.

123
00:08:32,793 --> 00:08:34,461
<i>Guess what, you're both wrong...</i>

124
00:08:36,397 --> 00:08:37,783
Why are those guys here too?

125
00:08:37,868 --> 00:08:39,663
U-Um... Well...

126
00:08:39,871 --> 00:08:43,255
Because.. We couldn't just ask
Iroha's friends to come along with us!

127
00:08:43,566 --> 00:08:46,149
I mean, I'm in a pretty tough spot too, you know!

128
00:08:47,046 --> 00:08:47,651
'Kay...

129
00:09:12,042 --> 00:09:12,882
Hikki.

130
00:09:14,156 --> 00:09:15,282
Thanks for waiting.

131
00:09:16,949 --> 00:09:19,024
<i>Is her soul being sucked out or something?</i>

132
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:27,289
'Kay got it.. Here you go Yui.

133
00:09:27,402 --> 00:09:29,197
Ah great! Thanks so much!

134
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:30,888
Yuigahama...

135
00:09:30,913 --> 00:09:32,402
You know you can't just do that.

136
00:09:32,427 --> 00:09:35,437
Yea but if I ask first, you two
wouldn't have let me take a picture.

137
00:09:35,508 --> 00:09:36,836
That's actually worse.

138
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:39,163
You can't just take a picture without permission.

139
00:09:41,169 --> 00:09:43,901
Sorry guys... I'll ask you next time.

140
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:45,834
There's no next time.

141
00:09:47,866 --> 00:09:50,811
I said sorry! Yukinon stop, wait!

142
00:10:06,457 --> 00:10:08,754
Since this place isn't really Christmassy,

143
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:11,098
it probably won't be a very good resource for us.

144
00:10:11,123 --> 00:10:12,018
Whadda I do?

145
00:10:12,115 --> 00:10:13,488
What the heck do I do?

146
00:10:15,139 --> 00:10:15,799
Hayato!

147
00:10:16,199 --> 00:10:16,665
Hey!

148
00:10:16,776 --> 00:10:18,079
We're riding this together.

149
00:10:18,104 --> 00:10:19,678
Why you little...

150
00:10:19,877 --> 00:10:21,084
Don't you dare.

151
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,901
Hey Tobe...

152
00:10:23,145 --> 00:10:24,663
you're being a third wheel.

153
00:10:24,796 --> 00:10:26,682
But! I'll freak out!

154
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:27,715
And?

155
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,760
Poor thing.. He's having a hard time.

156
00:10:33,353 --> 00:10:35,446
Yeah well. You should help him out.

157
00:10:37,153 --> 00:10:41,486
Or, even better you can go help
him out! Tobe Hachi sounds hot!

158
00:10:41,851 --> 00:10:42,924
Please, just stop.

159
00:10:43,034 --> 00:10:43,588
Sure.

160
00:10:45,132 --> 00:10:46,655
Let's ride together... 'Kay?

161
00:10:46,944 --> 00:10:48,269
Thanks, Hayato!

162
00:10:49,374 --> 00:10:51,486
About before... I'm sorry.

163
00:10:51,705 --> 00:10:55,451
So tell me, did I really cause things
to get awkward between all you guys?

164
00:10:58,508 --> 00:10:59,668
No, you didn't.

165
00:11:00,605 --> 00:11:01,359
How about you?

166
00:11:01,575 --> 00:11:02,105
Same.

167
00:11:03,629 --> 00:11:04,566
Thanks to you.

168
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:20,484
Oh hey, thank you so mu...

169
00:11:21,340 --> 00:11:23,985
Are you ok? You don't look so good.

170
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,443
Oh, it's just you, Miura.

171
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,564
You're looking really pale there.

172
00:11:29,018 --> 00:11:29,937
Here's water?

173
00:11:30,381 --> 00:11:31,223
Thank you.

174
00:11:32,418 --> 00:11:34,129
<i>Isn't Miura a nice girl?</i>

175
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:36,249
Yukinon, are you okay?

176
00:11:37,812 --> 00:11:39,190
Don't worry I'm fine.

177
00:11:39,501 --> 00:11:42,276
It's just crowded... Plus a little hard to handle.

178
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,187
Let's go.

179
00:11:51,523 --> 00:11:52,294
Yeah!

180
00:11:55,954 --> 00:11:58,768
<i>You know... This isn't very Christmas-like either.</i>

181
00:12:00,676 --> 00:12:01,964
Hurry up, Hikki!

182
00:12:02,663 --> 00:12:04,711
Enjoy your trip into the world of...

183
00:12:04,736 --> 00:12:06,048
Bamboo Fight!

184
00:12:12,863 --> 00:12:14,856
Wow. This is amazing.

185
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:15,796
Quiet.

186
00:12:17,543 --> 00:12:18,160
<i>Really?</i>

187
00:12:18,294 --> 00:12:19,660
<i>No talking allowed?</i>

188
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,223
<i>How much do you need to focus?</i>

189
00:12:29,071 --> 00:12:31,798
Aren't Mr. Pan's eyes really freakin' weird?

190
00:12:32,547 --> 00:12:36,033
I mean, honestly... I'd rather
just look at Mary the Aristocat.

191
00:12:40,569 --> 00:12:41,234
Really?

192
00:12:42,095 --> 00:12:44,275
I actually think he's really super cute!

193
00:12:44,355 --> 00:12:45,765
Isn't that right, Hayama?

194
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:56,024
<i>Can't you see... She's trying to make herself
look cute and sweet by fawning over the panda?</i>

195
00:13:02,053 --> 00:13:02,893
Hi-ya!

196
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:06,630
Hey... Hey...

197
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:11,448
<i>Annoying! Cute! Bothersome! Embarrassing!</i>

198
00:13:15,368 --> 00:13:19,213
Come on you can tell Mr. Pan what
is it that you really want, Hikki.

199
00:13:20,606 --> 00:13:21,613
I don't really wa...

200
00:13:28,615 --> 00:13:30,371
Nothing.. Really.

201
00:13:32,908 --> 00:13:34,585
Oh, sure okay.

202
00:13:41,384 --> 00:13:43,023
It's really crowded, huh?

203
00:13:43,229 --> 00:13:45,616
I'm surprised they wanted to come at this time of year.

204
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,940
I'll never come again, if I can help it.

205
00:13:48,266 --> 00:13:51,670
I would... I'd want to come
again if I ever got the chance...

206
00:13:58,045 --> 00:13:59,472
You can come back anytime.

207
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:01,015
It's close.

208
00:14:02,129 --> 00:14:03,127
That's not really...

209
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,506
what I meant though.

210
00:14:06,112 --> 00:14:08,578
However I won't wait if there's no point in waiting.

211
00:14:09,280 --> 00:14:11,544
Instead of waiting.. I'll move first.

212
00:14:18,562 --> 00:14:21,019
Destinyland is really bad at this time of the year.

213
00:14:22,599 --> 00:14:25,871
But I really wouldn't mind knowing what
the newer park next door is like you know.

214
00:14:27,646 --> 00:14:30,561
I bet you it it's a bit quieter there... Maybe.

215
00:14:31,935 --> 00:14:32,638
Maybe.

216
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:38,805
Well..someday then.

217
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:41,933
Mm..someday then.

218
00:14:43,219 --> 00:14:45,096
Let's choose something... shall we?

219
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:50,362
Hikki! How about these?

220
00:14:56,290 --> 00:14:59,311
So, um.. Which one of these would Komachi like?

221
00:14:59,342 --> 00:15:02,816
<i>Lighten up you don't have to
be so serious here of all places.</i>

222
00:15:03,813 --> 00:15:04,847
Hey, Yukinon.

223
00:15:05,136 --> 00:15:05,599
What?

224
00:15:09,474 --> 00:15:11,124
Hikki! Can you take a picture?

225
00:15:11,557 --> 00:15:13,228
Oh yeah... Okay. Got it.

226
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:29,939
What? Really?

227
00:15:30,882 --> 00:15:32,234
Uh... Are you okay?

228
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,050
Yes.

229
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,158
Oh no!

230
00:15:40,086 --> 00:15:42,621
It's okay. We'll catch up later.

231
00:15:43,129 --> 00:15:44,194
Okay then!

232
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:46,528
Shall we go?

233
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:47,502
Great idea.

234
00:15:56,383 --> 00:15:57,513
She's not answering.

235
00:15:57,843 --> 00:16:00,391
Since we've gotten this far,
we may as well enjoy the ride.

236
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,624
They might be waiting for us at the exit.

237
00:16:02,884 --> 00:16:04,410
R... Right, yes.

238
00:16:10,406 --> 00:16:13,220
Wait a second.. Are you scared of these rides?

239
00:16:13,467 --> 00:16:16,217
Not exactly... I mean I'm not scared, but...

240
00:16:18,305 --> 00:16:21,220
You really should've said
something earlier. Let's go back.

241
00:16:21,947 --> 00:16:22,906
It'll be okay.

242
00:16:23,768 --> 00:16:25,752
But, you don't like these rides, right?

243
00:16:26,067 --> 00:16:27,656
I'm saying it's going to be okay.

244
00:16:27,681 --> 00:16:28,641
Are you crazy?

245
00:16:28,982 --> 00:16:31,080
This isn't something worth getting stubborn about.

246
00:16:31,502 --> 00:16:32,337
That's not it.

247
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,047
It'll be fine, really.

248
00:16:35,433 --> 00:16:37,851
So..I wasn't really sure at first,

249
00:16:38,644 --> 00:16:41,265
but when I rode with Yuigahama earlier, I was fine.

250
00:16:42,278 --> 00:16:45,227
I think I can handle this... Most likely.

251
00:16:57,507 --> 00:17:00,444
The drop isn't happening soon,
so you can let go of the bar.

252
00:17:01,723 --> 00:17:03,532
O-..okay then.

253
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,208
You really aren't good with these, are you?

254
00:17:08,408 --> 00:17:09,118
I'm not.

255
00:17:09,417 --> 00:17:11,290
It's because of my sister, really.

256
00:17:12,832 --> 00:17:13,958
When we were kids...

257
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:18,090
She'd always manage to find some way
to mess with me at places like this.

258
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,749
I can see that happening.

259
00:17:21,060 --> 00:17:22,865
She looked like she was having fun...

260
00:17:23,042 --> 00:17:24,397
No matter what she was doing.

261
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,752
That's how she's always been.

262
00:17:40,546 --> 00:17:41,792
Hey, Hikigaya...

263
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:51,551
Promise me.. You'll save me someday.

264
00:18:12,930 --> 00:18:13,484
Here.

265
00:18:13,601 --> 00:18:14,290
Thank you.

266
00:18:14,656 --> 00:18:15,530
How much was it?

267
00:18:16,097 --> 00:18:16,734
Don't worry.

268
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:20,189
There's no way I'm taking money from someone who's sick.

269
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:21,507
That's not a good reason.

270
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,615
Ambulances don't ask for money.

271
00:18:24,008 --> 00:18:26,819
But Paramedics need to get paid for their services...

272
00:18:29,729 --> 00:18:32,039
We've gotten into a similar argument before.

273
00:18:32,130 --> 00:18:33,043
Huh, did we?

274
00:18:33,502 --> 00:18:35,105
It was after we got that doll.

275
00:18:37,327 --> 00:18:38,708
Oh yeah that.

276
00:18:39,268 --> 00:18:41,094
We ran into my sister after that.

277
00:18:42,011 --> 00:18:45,587
You know what... I must admit I was
surprised when you saw through her.

278
00:18:46,048 --> 00:18:47,801
That was just the impression I got from her.

279
00:18:48,421 --> 00:18:51,332
Besides, she doesn't cover things
up when people can see through her.

280
00:18:51,993 --> 00:18:52,679
You're right.

281
00:18:53,346 --> 00:18:55,405
I think that's part of her charm actually.

282
00:18:56,038 --> 00:18:59,080
She just has this thing. Everyone always loves her.

283
00:19:01,892 --> 00:19:06,107
As for me.. I was the obedient girl
that never gave anyone any trouble,

284
00:19:06,787 --> 00:19:12,522
People talked... called me stuck-up,
unpleasant... and other things behind my back.

285
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:16,657
Yeah... You know.. I got that as well.

286
00:19:17,141 --> 00:19:21,929
However, in your case.. It was probably
things more like crass, cheeky, or trash.

287
00:19:21,976 --> 00:19:24,726
Whoa. Wasn't the last one pretty uncalled for?

288
00:19:27,054 --> 00:19:30,757
So anyways... I had no idea how I was supposed to act.

289
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:34,842
So are you still wishing to be more like your big sister?

290
00:19:35,429 --> 00:19:38,364
I don't know. I don't really feel that way anymore...

291
00:19:39,652 --> 00:19:42,927
though she does have something
about her that I definitely don't have.

292
00:19:43,759 --> 00:19:45,362
And you feel like you need that?

293
00:19:45,468 --> 00:19:51,229
No. I used to sit and wonder why I didn't
have what she did but... it would just upset me.

294
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:53,725
You have it too.

295
00:19:54,366 --> 00:19:56,806
You also have something that I don't have either.

296
00:19:57,615 --> 00:19:59,540
So really, we weren't similar at all.

297
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:01,493
Guess you're right.

298
00:20:02,020 --> 00:20:04,799
I think... I wanted something different.

299
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:09,894
And when I finally realized I
couldn't do much of anything,

300
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,380
I started wanting something that neither one of you had.

301
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,155
I thought if I had that, I could help.

302
00:20:18,644 --> 00:20:19,425
Help what?

303
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:22,049
Huh... I wonder?

304
00:20:25,657 --> 00:20:27,722
I'm sorry we went on without you!

305
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:29,755
Don't worry its no big deal.

306
00:20:30,328 --> 00:20:33,087
I hope you got some real good pictures
at the parade while we were gone.

307
00:20:33,343 --> 00:20:35,919
Yeah! I got some of Mr. Pan, too.

308
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:39,419
Oh let me see that, do you mind if
I take a look at all your pictures.

309
00:20:39,817 --> 00:20:41,769
You know you could have gone too if you'd said something.

310
00:20:41,794 --> 00:20:44,053
Hey? Where's Hayato?

311
00:20:44,180 --> 00:20:46,479
Hey Yumiko, let's go over here.

312
00:20:46,504 --> 00:20:48,290
Hey wait. What are you doing, Tobe?

313
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:49,387
Just come with me.

314
00:20:55,193 --> 00:20:56,123
It's starting.

315
00:21:12,336 --> 00:21:13,802
Brings back memories, huh?

316
00:21:53,856 --> 00:21:54,576
I-Iroha?

317
00:21:54,997 --> 00:21:55,809
Iroha!

318
00:23:41,394 --> 00:23:45,037
"Of all who give gifts, these two were the most wise".

319
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:47,430
"Everywhere they are the wise ones."

320
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:49,563
That's the "Gift of the Magi."

321
00:23:49,949 --> 00:23:51,014
Seriously?

322
00:23:51,516 --> 00:23:53,735
They should've just talked it out as a married couple.

323
00:23:53,815 --> 00:23:56,395
I think they're going to break
up due to lack of communication.

324
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:58,865
You're so ruthless, Rumirumi.

325
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:00,675
Calling me Rumirumi is gross.

326
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,851
G-Gross?

327
00:24:02,411 --> 00:24:05,385
I dare you to say that one more time... Please.

328
00:24:05,410 --> 00:24:06,094
Gross.

329
00:24:06,429 --> 00:24:08,465
O-One more, no, three more times!

330
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,653
You're all so dumb.
