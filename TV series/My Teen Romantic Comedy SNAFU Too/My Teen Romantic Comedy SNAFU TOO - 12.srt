1
00:00:02,893 --> 00:00:05,388
- Did you need something? - I mean, you called me here.

2
00:00:05,482 --> 00:00:08,812
I was thinking we could compare
our answers as we said we would.

3
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,225
Did you ask Yukino about her plans?

4
00:00:11,304 --> 00:00:15,341
I know we agreed to that but I don't think
it's fair of me to be the one to tell you.

5
00:00:15,456 --> 00:00:17,124
My what a loyal friend!

6
00:00:17,262 --> 00:00:21,614
I see how it is.. She really
did tell you her plans didn't she?

7
00:00:21,744 --> 00:00:25,537
Wow. So Yukino really does trusts you a great deal huh?

8
00:00:26,388 --> 00:00:27,874
I don't know if it's really trust.

9
00:00:28,057 --> 00:00:30,093
I'm not really very trustworthy.

10
00:00:30,118 --> 00:00:32,144
Oh, so you already know that then?

11
00:00:33,334 --> 00:00:36,159
Right. It's not really trust per se.

12
00:00:36,418 --> 00:00:37,947
It's something much worse.

13
00:00:41,141 --> 00:00:42,647
She hasn't changed at all.

14
00:00:42,736 --> 00:00:44,974
And she actually thinks that this is okay.

15
00:00:45,437 --> 00:00:48,259
I suppose that's a fairly cute thing about her, but...

16
00:00:48,939 --> 00:00:50,527
I don't like this one little bit.

17
00:00:51,656 --> 00:00:53,186
If it isn't trust, then what is it?

18
00:00:54,557 --> 00:00:58,745
Well... At the very least, it's
something that can't be called genuine.

19
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:00,820
That was your word, huh?

20
00:01:02,353 --> 00:01:06,128
Does something like "genuine"... really ever exist?

21
00:02:40,183 --> 00:02:43,863
Man... I'm really wanting to
eat something sweet... ya know?

22
00:02:44,268 --> 00:02:45,309
Don't you guys?

23
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:47,413
Yummy chocolate?

24
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,021
Just a bit? Just a bit o' choco?

25
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,732
That's right it's coming up soon.

26
00:02:51,830 --> 00:02:53,383
You'll be fine though, Hayato.

27
00:02:53,626 --> 00:02:54,966
The rest of us are in trouble.

28
00:02:55,214 --> 00:03:00,140
That's true except Hayato won't really accept
any Valentine's chocolates this year, right?

29
00:03:00,198 --> 00:03:02,340
For real?! What a waste!

30
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,638
I get it though. I mean isn't it kinda scary to
get chocolates from someone you don't really know?

31
00:03:08,591 --> 00:03:11,320
Well, handmade ones are a bit too serious, right?

32
00:03:11,969 --> 00:03:12,968
Serious?

33
00:03:14,397 --> 00:03:15,965
Sure that's right... I guess.

34
00:03:16,197 --> 00:03:19,284
Just some chocolate! Just one thing, a chocolate, please!

35
00:03:19,399 --> 00:03:20,754
Just a little bit'a chocolate!

36
00:03:28,484 --> 00:03:30,098
Handmade... huh?

37
00:03:36,844 --> 00:03:40,282
Hey. Why'd you just leave me behind?

38
00:03:40,307 --> 00:03:42,965
I've never implied that we'd always go to club together.

39
00:03:43,779 --> 00:03:46,073
Well I just thought you would just wait for me, Hikki.

40
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:48,535
Since you stayed in the classroom for a while and all.

41
00:03:49,478 --> 00:03:52,258
Well... Hayama and Miura seemed to be a bit better.

42
00:03:52,882 --> 00:03:55,240
Yeah... seems like everything's fine again.

43
00:03:56,175 --> 00:03:58,885
Everything's going pretty great, right? You know,

44
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:01,820
it's like they're really trying to treasure this moment.

45
00:04:02,013 --> 00:04:03,810
Or they think now is the best time...

46
00:04:04,068 --> 00:04:05,015
Yeah maybe.

47
00:04:05,969 --> 00:04:07,827
There's probably no better time than now.

48
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:11,208
Whoa! It's a very rare positive thought from Hikki!

49
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:13,519
Well the past just makes you want to die from regret

50
00:04:13,544 --> 00:04:16,212
and thoughts of the future
makes you depressed with anxiety.

51
00:04:16,333 --> 00:04:18,804
So process of elimination, now is the best time.

52
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:20,617
Never mind! It was negative!

53
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:22,740
I guess things never change...

54
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:31,666
So, hey there... Will you be free anytime soon?

55
00:04:32,081 --> 00:04:36,555
Huh?! Well, uh... Yeah. I mean... I probably am.

56
00:04:36,616 --> 00:04:39,643
I'm generally mostly free... but it's just I...

57
00:04:45,334 --> 00:04:46,821
I'm gonna think on it a bit.

58
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,101
O-Okay.

59
00:04:49,735 --> 00:04:50,971
Yahallo!

60
00:04:53,071 --> 00:04:54,879
Hikigaya you're late!

61
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:58,251
Isshiki, what are you even doing here?

62
00:04:59,750 --> 00:05:04,325
Anyways... I don't really care by the
way, but do you happen to like sweets?

63
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:07,795
Ya know I'm pretty sure that
Hayama would be happy to eat whatever.

64
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:12,265
I think Hayama actually said he
wasn't accepting any chocolates.

65
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:14,902
What? Why is that?! Don't know.

66
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,594
Because it would obviously lead to conflict.

67
00:05:17,763 --> 00:05:23,264
Back in elementary school, the classroom always had
a more strained atmosphere the day after Valentines.

68
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:27,627
Well... I guess I'll just have to settle for you.

69
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,754
Does someone like you enjoy sweet stuff?

70
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,698
That's a weird question, isn't it?

71
00:05:31,723 --> 00:05:32,659
Hikki just...

72
00:05:33,218 --> 00:05:34,952
he just really really loves sweets!

73
00:05:35,365 --> 00:05:36,642
He honestly does.

74
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:39,882
I don't actually know why you two had to answer for him,

75
00:05:40,113 --> 00:05:41,821
but if so, then that's perfect!

76
00:05:42,027 --> 00:05:43,111
What are you talking about?

77
00:05:43,136 --> 00:05:46,530
Well I wasn't actually sure how
sweet I should be making the chocolate.

78
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:49,561
I mean everyone really has different preferences, right?

79
00:05:49,667 --> 00:05:50,960
Making chocolate huh?

80
00:05:51,310 --> 00:05:53,982
So your saying you plan on making these candies yourself?

81
00:05:54,119 --> 00:05:54,866
I'm surprised.

82
00:05:54,891 --> 00:05:56,150
Why would you say that?!

83
00:05:56,252 --> 00:05:58,272
I'm really quite good at making sweets!

84
00:05:58,764 --> 00:06:02,837
Anyway, I just want to ask your opinion on
the chocolate I'm making out of obligation.

85
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:04,076
Obligation?

86
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:07,938
Oh what? Are you the type who's never
actually gotten chocolate before?

87
00:06:08,628 --> 00:06:09,488
Hikki...

88
00:06:10,448 --> 00:06:12,225
will be getting chocolates for sure.

89
00:06:13,356 --> 00:06:13,922
Right?

90
00:06:18,834 --> 00:06:20,327
Huh? Do you mean...

91
00:06:20,683 --> 00:06:22,060
Heh. That's right.

92
00:06:22,695 --> 00:06:24,390
I've got Komachi, after all.

93
00:06:24,458 --> 00:06:28,528
Komachi? What is that? A rice? She's not a rice.

94
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,466
Komachi is actually Hikki's way cooler little sister.

95
00:06:32,007 --> 00:06:32,956
Your sister?

96
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:34,172
You're such a moron.

97
00:06:34,197 --> 00:06:36,331
I dunno if I can actually deny that though.

98
00:06:36,466 --> 00:06:39,344
So you really are into younger girls after all, huh?

99
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:41,349
That isn't true.

100
00:06:42,004 --> 00:06:45,790
And besides that, your birthday's in April,
so there's less than a year's difference.

101
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,943
You don't really feel like a younger girl at all.

102
00:06:50,783 --> 00:06:51,248
What?

103
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:52,370
Oh, nothing.

104
00:06:53,007 --> 00:06:54,650
I was a bit surprised, that's all.

105
00:06:54,692 --> 00:06:56,934
Weird! Why do you know her birthday?!

106
00:06:57,197 --> 00:06:59,698
You're being creepy, Hikki! Seriously creepy.

107
00:06:59,846 --> 00:07:01,553
You're pretty well informed there.

108
00:07:01,947 --> 00:07:04,767
You know, you were there when she brought it up herself.

109
00:07:04,951 --> 00:07:06,973
You were pointlessly trying to be sly, weren't you?

110
00:07:07,016 --> 00:07:09,698
Pointless... It wasn't pointless at all!

111
00:07:09,723 --> 00:07:14,149
And I'm not sly! If anything, you're
the one being sly here! So stop being mean.

112
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,234
Well actually,

113
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:21,172
I was kinda thinking... I wanna try making some chocolate.

114
00:07:21,396 --> 00:07:24,209
I mean why not? Next year we have exams.

115
00:07:24,369 --> 00:07:27,819
So I figured I should go ahead
and give it a try now, right?

116
00:07:27,844 --> 00:07:28,959
It's now or never.

117
00:07:29,215 --> 00:07:32,267
Wait didn't you say handmade chocolate is way too serious?

118
00:07:32,292 --> 00:07:34,619
{\an8}W-well yes but...

119
00:07:34,816 --> 00:07:37,722
You know what I happen to think
is actually a really good idea.

120
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:41,117
Hikitani you should def give
Hayato some good buddy chocolates!

121
00:07:41,142 --> 00:07:42,395
Nope I don't think so.

122
00:07:42,536 --> 00:07:44,594
I mean it's not like he's gonna accept them anyway.

123
00:07:44,619 --> 00:07:46,451
I bet he would if it was from another guy.

124
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:48,357
Why would a guy do that on Valentine's?

125
00:07:48,554 --> 00:07:50,126
Yeah why would he do that?

126
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:53,964
If he says he's not accepting any,
that makes things a lot more difficult.

127
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,563
It really does.

128
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:00,555
Wow... they're quite scary.

129
00:08:05,686 --> 00:08:07,675
Well... did you need something?

130
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:09,820
Uh, well...

131
00:08:10,488 --> 00:08:13,914
Hey can't you see that I was actually
here first and I'm not done talking?

132
00:08:13,939 --> 00:08:15,984
Yeah? All I see is you drinking tea.

133
00:08:16,008 --> 00:08:16,533
What?

134
00:08:16,558 --> 00:08:20,479
Hey come on now. I'm sure Sakisaki
had a reason to come here, too.

135
00:08:20,794 --> 00:08:22,592
I think we should all hear her out now.

136
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,766
Well it's... its about chocolate as well.

137
00:08:26,458 --> 00:08:29,632
Really you're gonna give someone
chocolates? That's hilarious.

138
00:08:29,657 --> 00:08:30,309
Yeah?

139
00:08:30,534 --> 00:08:31,271
Yeah!

140
00:08:31,296 --> 00:08:34,890
I'm not like you. So you can go
quit acting all high and mighty.

141
00:08:34,954 --> 00:08:35,438
Yeah?

142
00:08:35,462 --> 00:08:36,170
Yeah!

143
00:08:36,584 --> 00:08:38,514
Stop it! Play nice!

144
00:08:39,313 --> 00:08:41,520
Kay... what about chocolate?

145
00:08:42,117 --> 00:08:44,247
My little sister wants to try and make some.

146
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:47,406
Is there anything with chocolate
even a little kid can make?

147
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,757
Something a little kid can make?

148
00:08:49,923 --> 00:08:53,160
But Sakisaki... I thought you were good at home ec stuff.

149
00:08:53,845 --> 00:08:57,200
Well I can cook a bit, but the
stuff I make is really plain.

150
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,934
I don't really think it's something a kid would like much.

151
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,313
So what kind of stuff can you make, by the way?

152
00:09:05,718 --> 00:09:07,729
Boi-Boiled...

153
00:09:09,155 --> 00:09:11,419
I can make boiled sweet potatoes.

154
00:09:13,457 --> 00:09:15,126
Yep, that's plain.

155
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:16,789
I think that's pretty good!

156
00:09:16,814 --> 00:09:21,907
I can't cook anything at all, so I think that
makes you really quite awesome! Right... Yukinon?

157
00:09:21,952 --> 00:09:22,796
Indeed.

158
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:28,602
I think that totally sounds like something cats would
really love. I really think cats loving things is so cute.

159
00:09:28,627 --> 00:09:30,580
Come on is that the best you can do here?!

160
00:09:30,605 --> 00:09:32,366
Cats have nothing to do with this.

161
00:09:33,688 --> 00:09:35,067
This is quite a problem.

162
00:09:35,587 --> 00:09:40,861
Yeah. Miura is really pulling out all the stops
and I'm getting worried that I can't keep up with her.

163
00:09:40,922 --> 00:09:44,534
That's true, but I was actually talking
about the number of requests coming in.

164
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,108
I feel bad... but I kinda get how Hayama feels about this.

165
00:09:49,368 --> 00:09:51,863
Oh, wait that's not what I really meant here.

166
00:09:51,888 --> 00:09:55,906
I meant he's popular so he's gotta think of
other's feelings and is looking out for that.

167
00:09:56,135 --> 00:09:59,345
Yeah, I think that kinda sounds a bit like you.

168
00:10:00,395 --> 00:10:02,113
Really you think so?

169
00:10:05,458 --> 00:10:07,234
So just like me... huh?

170
00:10:07,922 --> 00:10:10,392
Well... all we need is an excuse.

171
00:10:11,024 --> 00:10:13,221
Like a reason for Hayato to accept it.

172
00:10:13,448 --> 00:10:14,000
Huh?

173
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,929
A situation where he has to take it.

174
00:10:17,098 --> 00:10:19,682
Or, one where taking it is the obvious course of action.

175
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:24,334
Okay... so you're saying we
need to come up with an excuse?

176
00:10:25,655 --> 00:10:28,426
For example... instead of a grand gesture,

177
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,409
if you just asked him to test it, he probably would.

178
00:10:31,784 --> 00:10:33,515
Not that I really know.

179
00:10:35,081 --> 00:10:37,589
Hey I know, why don't we all just make some together?

180
00:10:37,614 --> 00:10:39,724
Yeah that is an excellent idea!

181
00:10:39,749 --> 00:10:42,386
Get everyone who asked for help and make an event!

182
00:10:42,471 --> 00:10:45,941
Then you can offer a masterclass
and teach everyone at the same time.

183
00:10:46,444 --> 00:10:48,949
Uh, sure. I actually wouldn't mind doing that.

184
00:10:50,363 --> 00:10:51,570
Uh, vice president?

185
00:10:51,595 --> 00:10:53,878
I need you to draw up and submit a proposal!

186
00:10:53,915 --> 00:10:54,863
So what can I do?

187
00:10:55,096 --> 00:10:56,886
Well let's see, how about you...

188
00:10:58,088 --> 00:10:59,610
just come and work as my partner.

189
00:10:59,635 --> 00:11:01,296
You don't believe in me at all!

190
00:11:01,697 --> 00:11:04,677
So, uh, what will Hikki do then in the class?

191
00:11:05,024 --> 00:11:06,939
Nope, I absolutely cannot cook.

192
00:11:07,128 --> 00:11:07,912
That's okay.

193
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:11,764
You only need to taste the chocolate
and then give us your thoughts.

194
00:11:11,789 --> 00:11:14,217
You're asking the right person. I am very good at that.

195
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:16,643
Okay, I'm counting on you.

196
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:18,922
Okay that's set.

197
00:11:18,947 --> 00:11:21,262
The student council will handle all the details,

198
00:11:21,287 --> 00:11:24,116
Alrighty then you guys, go put on a great class.

199
00:11:26,927 --> 00:11:30,267
So... our last event was very well-received.

200
00:11:30,496 --> 00:11:35,050
We garnered a lot of attention. I'd really like
the opportunity to keep our alliance going strong.

201
00:11:35,075 --> 00:11:36,303
That sounds great!

202
00:11:38,267 --> 00:11:40,361
Oh... I see you guys are here, as well.

203
00:11:40,386 --> 00:11:42,910
Oh, didn't I tell you they were coming?

204
00:11:43,070 --> 00:11:46,354
I'm afraid I don't remember seeing
it in our most recent text exchange...

205
00:11:47,073 --> 00:11:49,129
Oh, man. You're so cute!

206
00:11:50,058 --> 00:11:52,605
We'd like to go ahead and get started, Mr. President.

207
00:11:52,630 --> 00:11:54,014
Great. See you later.

208
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,420
This is also a chance at business...

209
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:58,935
What are they doing here, Isshiki?

210
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:03,500
I figured we could get some funds from
them by collaborating. Isn't that for the best?

211
00:12:03,719 --> 00:12:06,732
And it'd be great for me if I
didn't have to spend my own money.

212
00:12:07,006 --> 00:12:08,245
O-okay.

213
00:12:08,485 --> 00:12:10,480
Well let's put that thought aside for now,

214
00:12:11,058 --> 00:12:13,544
You hide it but you know you're quite capable, Isshiki.

215
00:12:14,323 --> 00:12:15,550
Yahallo!

216
00:12:16,559 --> 00:12:17,467
Sister...

217
00:12:17,511 --> 00:12:19,730
Sorry I was running so late, you guys!

218
00:12:19,847 --> 00:12:23,459
Looks it's Miss Haruno, she's going
to be our special lecturer for today!

219
00:12:23,739 --> 00:12:26,278
Oh Hello there, I'm Miss Haruno!

220
00:12:26,844 --> 00:12:28,221
And WHY did you call her here?

221
00:12:28,261 --> 00:12:31,715
Because she seems really experienced
and I thought we needed that, right?

222
00:12:32,043 --> 00:12:33,776
I could've done this by myself.

223
00:12:35,704 --> 00:12:37,628
Cut up the chocolate and boil it in water.

224
00:12:38,119 --> 00:12:40,927
Once it cools down, then pour it into a mold.

225
00:12:41,124 --> 00:12:41,987
Is that it?

226
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:43,899
Yeah, that's about it more or less.

227
00:12:44,347 --> 00:12:46,254
Huh. That sounds so easy.

228
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:47,501
Don't be so naive!

229
00:12:47,526 --> 00:12:51,044
There's so much more than just boiling water
and simply adding chocolate!

230
00:12:51,069 --> 00:12:54,163
You gotta do it like BAM! And then POW kay?

231
00:12:56,478 --> 00:12:58,671
Was it really okay to bring her along?

232
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:00,490
Don't know why it wouldn't be.

233
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:04,911
Thank you. All right Kei, what
kind of candy would you like to eat?

234
00:13:05,615 --> 00:13:06,942
Eel please!

235
00:13:07,013 --> 00:13:09,308
Uh... uh, well... okay then.

236
00:13:09,692 --> 00:13:10,638
Sorry!

237
00:13:10,845 --> 00:13:13,016
We had that for dinner just the other night.

238
00:13:13,229 --> 00:13:15,681
She loved it and has asked for it ever since.

239
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,891
Overseas, it's more common for
men to give gifts on Valentine's.

240
00:13:19,936 --> 00:13:22,534
So, we should keep that
globalization in mind for this event.

241
00:13:22,559 --> 00:13:23,994
This was a really good idea.

242
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:29,035
With it this way, everyone can act normal.

243
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:33,181
And Tobe's really excited about it, too.

244
00:13:33,558 --> 00:13:34,311
Choco!

245
00:13:34,669 --> 00:13:36,955
I really don't care much about chocolate or Tobe.

246
00:13:37,163 --> 00:13:38,157
Mainly Tobe.

247
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:40,112
That's a little harsh.

248
00:13:40,137 --> 00:13:41,087
Hayato!

249
00:13:50,052 --> 00:13:52,508
Wow... You're really good at this, huh?

250
00:13:53,087 --> 00:13:54,681
Are you hitting on me again?

251
00:13:54,706 --> 00:13:59,375
Thinking that whispering sweet words to me would
work just because I'm making sweets is cute, but foolish.

252
00:13:59,400 --> 00:14:01,422
I'm sorry but, please try again later.

253
00:14:03,171 --> 00:14:03,772
Here!

254
00:14:07,382 --> 00:14:10,095
So tell me, is it way too sweet for you or what?

255
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:17,690
You must remember that there is quite a difference between
Japanese and overseas mindsets when it comes to sweets.

256
00:14:17,819 --> 00:14:19,437
You could call it a culture gap.

257
00:14:20,354 --> 00:14:22,836
Do you have any extra chocolate molds, Hikigaya?

258
00:14:23,214 --> 00:14:24,330
Uh, yeah.

259
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,674
Thanks, these are perfect!

260
00:14:28,985 --> 00:14:32,231
Come to think of it, didn't I
give you Valentine chocolate once?

261
00:14:34,618 --> 00:14:35,787
No, never.

262
00:14:38,092 --> 00:14:39,833
Then I'll give you some this year.

263
00:14:39,955 --> 00:14:41,512
Uh, okay.

264
00:14:43,838 --> 00:14:47,695
That reminds me! You got some from
Yukino before, didn't you, Hayato?

265
00:14:50,887 --> 00:14:52,000
Yeah... I did.

266
00:14:53,288 --> 00:14:55,117
It was before we started elementary school.

267
00:14:55,142 --> 00:14:57,285
I believe you got some too, Haruno.

268
00:15:07,502 --> 00:15:10,754
So... who are you planning to give chocolate to?

269
00:15:10,779 --> 00:15:13,001
Well that's actually not any of your business now is it?

270
00:15:13,026 --> 00:15:15,060
Interesting you're not telling me nobody?

271
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:17,918
Which leads me to believe someone is getting some.

272
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:22,901
Well, there's only a few guys
you'd even consider giving chocolate.

273
00:15:24,465 --> 00:15:26,831
That's ridiculous. You can say what...

274
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,169
I-I'm so sorry!

275
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:35,493
It's fine...

276
00:15:36,228 --> 00:15:37,772
Why are you getting so flustered?

277
00:15:38,219 --> 00:15:40,532
Looking at you like that makes me get flustered, too.

278
00:15:43,562 --> 00:15:45,581
Do not get... flustered.

279
00:15:48,629 --> 00:15:50,431
You still have a way to go, Yukinon.

280
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:54,710
My special ability to handle
bowls and utensils is top notch.

281
00:15:55,134 --> 00:15:58,569
That may be true for this, but you're
still hopeless at everything else.

282
00:16:46,433 --> 00:16:48,852
Well this turned out to be a great event.

283
00:16:48,916 --> 00:16:51,665
It did. Though for a school event it was pretty weird.

284
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,955
You know what, that's okay.

285
00:16:53,354 --> 00:16:55,781
Because you're actually a pretty weird guy as well.

286
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:59,324
Take a look around. Everyone here is kind of weird.

287
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:01,123
Of course, this would end up weird.

288
00:17:01,336 --> 00:17:02,945
Don't you think you're being a little mean?

289
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:07,455
No... but I do believe I understand you a bit better now.

290
00:17:07,561 --> 00:17:10,641
People's perception of others
tend to get clearer day by day.

291
00:17:10,860 --> 00:17:13,544
If you continue to spend time
with someone and grow with them,

292
00:17:13,666 --> 00:17:15,226
you'll eventually understand them.

293
00:17:15,351 --> 00:17:17,812
I don't feel like we've really
grown this year at all, y'know?

294
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:20,418
We just always seem to be doing the same thing.

295
00:17:20,845 --> 00:17:24,941
People usually don't look back to see how far
they've come while they're still walking forward.

296
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:28,522
Of course though, when they come
to a stop they look behind them,

297
00:17:28,775 --> 00:17:32,801
and the more progress they've made, the
more betrayed they feel by their expectations.

298
00:17:33,856 --> 00:17:37,666
Honestly for me, I'm glad I
was able to see this personally.

299
00:17:38,729 --> 00:17:41,178
But I can't continue watching over you guys forever.

300
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,738
Hikki, will you please give these a try for me?

301
00:17:54,231 --> 00:17:55,499
Kay... fine.

302
00:17:55,664 --> 00:17:58,660
You really seem to be preparing
for the absolute worst Hikigaya,

303
00:17:58,725 --> 00:18:00,853
you don't need to worry, I worked on them as well.

304
00:18:00,964 --> 00:18:02,912
Good, it's a relief to know I won't die.

305
00:18:03,131 --> 00:18:04,854
You don't have to be mean about it!

306
00:18:09,945 --> 00:18:11,436
Hmm, well...

307
00:18:12,669 --> 00:18:13,431
Thanks for that.

308
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:15,276
Sure!

309
00:18:16,851 --> 00:18:19,991
Huh. Is this what you're calling genuine?

310
00:18:24,125 --> 00:18:27,406
Are these the kinds of things you feel are genuine to you?

311
00:18:28,213 --> 00:18:29,697
I can't really say for sure.

312
00:18:30,518 --> 00:18:31,663
Is this really it?

313
00:18:32,428 --> 00:18:34,297
I thought you guys were better than that.

314
00:18:36,148 --> 00:18:38,332
Are you really this boring Hikigaya?

315
00:18:38,373 --> 00:18:41,654
I'd be the most popular guy in
class if I were slightly interesting.

316
00:18:42,020 --> 00:18:43,895
I really like that about you.

317
00:18:44,281 --> 00:18:47,023
But right now, you guys are seriously...

318
00:18:47,687 --> 00:18:49,136
pretty boring here.

319
00:18:50,033 --> 00:18:53,488
You know what? I actually prefer
the old Yukino to the new one.

320
00:18:58,832 --> 00:19:01,452
All of this was so new to me,

321
00:19:01,718 --> 00:19:03,683
and I'd never experienced anything like it,

322
00:19:04,219 --> 00:19:07,377
I thought... I just wasn't used to this sort of thing yet.

323
00:19:09,665 --> 00:19:10,974
I actually figured

324
00:19:11,155 --> 00:19:12,873
I'd eventually learn to live with it.

325
00:19:14,643 --> 00:19:18,292
But... she still saw right through all of us.

326
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,860
The student council can take
care of things, you guys can leave.

327
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:25,052
Oh... we don't mind staying and helping until the end.

328
00:19:25,167 --> 00:19:27,929
Yeah, you don't have to always be so polite with us.

329
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:29,480
If you're really sure?

330
00:19:30,055 --> 00:19:32,234
I'll gladly take you up on that offer.

331
00:19:35,469 --> 00:19:38,312
Haruno Yukinoshita had really made something obvious...

332
00:19:38,722 --> 00:19:40,694
something I was trying not to think about.

333
00:19:42,350 --> 00:19:43,889
She said it wasn't trust,

334
00:19:44,842 --> 00:19:47,904
but something else which was much worse than that.

335
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,812
Mother? Why are you here?

336
00:20:04,369 --> 00:20:08,036
Haruno told me all about your career
plans, and I wanted to talk to you.

337
00:20:11,142 --> 00:20:14,996
Yukino, what in the world are
you doing traipsing around so late?

338
00:20:17,923 --> 00:20:21,396
You know, I've never actually expected
this type of behavior to come from you.

339
00:20:23,316 --> 00:20:26,881
I put my trust in you and let
you do as you wanted, but now...

340
00:20:28,796 --> 00:20:32,351
No... I can only blame myself. This is my mistake.

341
00:20:34,694 --> 00:20:36,623
Please tell me where I went so wrong?

342
00:20:36,648 --> 00:20:37,165
Um...

343
00:20:37,678 --> 00:20:42,006
there was a student council event at school
today and we stayed late so we could clean up.

344
00:20:42,454 --> 00:20:46,135
I see. And you walked her home
afterwards? I appreciate it.

345
00:20:46,493 --> 00:20:48,750
But you really shouldn't be staying out so late...

346
00:20:48,872 --> 00:20:52,602
you do that and your family is
bound to start worrying. Right?

347
00:21:00,541 --> 00:21:03,758
I want you to stay true to
yourself and live a life of freedom,

348
00:21:04,134 --> 00:21:08,185
But I'm a bit worried with so much freedom
you may end up going down the wrong path.

349
00:21:08,628 --> 00:21:09,788
I will explain.

350
00:21:11,205 --> 00:21:12,739
But please go home now.

351
00:21:16,382 --> 00:21:19,121
True to herself? True to myself?

352
00:21:19,763 --> 00:21:23,031
We all have our own personal image
that others try and dictate for us...

353
00:21:23,637 --> 00:21:25,523
one that is always slightly off.

354
00:21:26,334 --> 00:21:28,281
We want to remain true to ourselves,

355
00:21:28,822 --> 00:21:30,347
but who gets to decide that?

356
00:21:30,633 --> 00:21:32,879
Who gets to control who we are as people?

357
00:21:35,902 --> 00:21:38,302
Um, I'm gonna... head home now.

358
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:40,206
Oh, I'll walk you.

359
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:40,992
It's okay.

360
00:21:42,015 --> 00:21:44,296
I feel like that'd be unfair.

361
00:21:46,062 --> 00:21:46,742
Okay.

362
00:21:55,610 --> 00:21:58,927
When our image never really matches with reality...

363
00:22:01,524 --> 00:22:06,002
Where can we find... something genuine?

364
00:22:07,635 --> 00:22:09,702
Where can we find our true selves?

365
00:23:42,272 --> 00:23:46,578
There's something I want, but I'm not very smart

366
00:23:47,379 --> 00:23:51,018
and I don't play fair, so I only know one answer.

367
00:23:52,473 --> 00:23:56,206
But I'm sure that's not the
answer someone would expect of me.

368
00:23:57,072 --> 00:24:01,366
Why is it that what I want and what's expected of me
are always so similar...

369
00:24:02,338 --> 00:24:04,230
but at the same time so different?

370
00:24:06,617 --> 00:24:08,789
Honestly, I'd be happy with a lie.
