1
00:00:01,713 --> 00:00:02,576
Big bro!

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:03,768
Take this!

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:04,826
Hm?

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:12,315
Ta-da! It's my recommended souvenir list!

5
00:00:12,340 --> 00:00:14,028
Read it, read it, read it, read it!

6
00:00:14,182 --> 00:00:15,122
Number 3!

7
00:00:18,483 --> 00:00:19,778
Raw yatsuhashi...?

8
00:00:20,079 --> 00:00:23,210
I don't care where you get it, the
first store, the main store, anywhere!

9
00:00:23,235 --> 00:00:23,966
Number 2!

10
00:00:25,892 --> 00:00:27,482
You want oil-absorbing sheets?

11
00:00:27,507 --> 00:00:29,585
Go ahead and get some for mom too, okay?

12
00:00:29,855 --> 00:00:32,370
And now, the long-awaited Number 1!

13
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,477
So, are you going to tell me what's number 1?

14
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:38,537
The number 1 souvenir is...

15
00:00:38,657 --> 00:00:40,909
My big bro's special memories from his trip!

16
00:00:41,043 --> 00:00:42,663
<i>She's cunning and cute...</i>

17
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:44,176
Hachiman...!

18
00:00:44,614 --> 00:00:45,677
Hachiman...

19
00:00:59,179 --> 00:01:00,870
Hachiman...

20
00:01:02,186 --> 00:01:04,283
I never heard you say Uno!

21
00:01:04,829 --> 00:01:05,731
Yaaay.

22
00:01:05,756 --> 00:01:07,224
<i>You're not even in this class.</i>

23
00:02:44,055 --> 00:02:45,230
Hayato!

24
00:02:45,255 --> 00:02:46,581
Oh my god! I'm scared!

25
00:02:46,606 --> 00:02:50,618
Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man!

26
00:02:52,425 --> 00:02:54,297
Did you hear that? A weird voice!

27
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,526
I seriously don't like this kind of stuff.

28
00:02:56,912 --> 00:02:59,536
It's not the ghosts at a haunted house that are scary.

29
00:02:59,695 --> 00:03:01,062
It's the living that are scary.

30
00:03:01,087 --> 00:03:02,850
You can be such a sourpuss.

31
00:03:02,875 --> 00:03:05,003
But you might be good for this type of thing.

32
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:08,426
Well the scariest haunted houses are the
ones where people are doing the scaring.

33
00:03:08,451 --> 00:03:09,366
Forget it!

34
00:03:09,407 --> 00:03:10,783
He's not good at this at all!

35
00:03:11,843 --> 00:03:14,583
Hey... You seem completely fine with all this stuff.

36
00:03:14,869 --> 00:03:17,102
Yeah, I actually like this type of thing.

37
00:03:24,715 --> 00:03:25,521
Kawasaki?

38
00:03:27,527 --> 00:03:28,947
Kawasaki!

39
00:03:29,087 --> 00:03:30,180
Ouch!

40
00:03:31,355 --> 00:03:32,295
Sorry!

41
00:03:32,527 --> 00:03:33,846
Did I really hurt you?

42
00:03:34,045 --> 00:03:35,831
Yeah, it really kind of hurt.

43
00:03:42,374 --> 00:03:46,659
Well... nevermind, forget it.

44
00:03:49,858 --> 00:03:50,657
Thank you.

45
00:03:51,135 --> 00:03:52,131
Come on, let's go.

46
00:04:02,582 --> 00:04:03,684
It's over...

47
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:05,925
That was really, really scary...

48
00:04:06,105 --> 00:04:08,024
That was so much fun, wasn't it?!

49
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:08,629
Yeah.

50
00:04:08,895 --> 00:04:10,794
We really had a good time in there, huh?

51
00:04:11,681 --> 00:04:12,786
Should we head out soon?

52
00:04:12,971 --> 00:04:14,974
Yea, let me go and look for Ebina.

53
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:18,504
Dude, a wooden sword!

54
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:20,381
Ebina, we're going!

55
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,814
Do you think the haunted house
actually worked at all on Tobe and Hina?

56
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,736
Hmm... I wonder.

57
00:04:32,397 --> 00:04:33,584
Down we go.

58
00:04:35,477 --> 00:04:36,843
What a coincidence.

59
00:04:38,392 --> 00:04:39,382
You came here too?

60
00:04:39,939 --> 00:04:40,689
Yes.

61
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:44,533
This place is known as "The Garden
of Tiger Cubs Crossing the Water."

62
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:47,212
Though I'm not sure which part are the tigers.

63
00:04:47,265 --> 00:04:51,394
<i>Oh. Of course, she's interested
since tigers are in the cat family.</i>

64
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:53,365
<i>She is a frisky cat lover.</i>

65
00:04:56,416 --> 00:04:57,869
Ah, Yukinon.

66
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:02,832
Let's go somewhere else ok.

67
00:05:05,924 --> 00:05:07,615
How's the status of our request?

68
00:05:09,239 --> 00:05:11,302
Um, it's a little difficult. Right?

69
00:05:11,327 --> 00:05:15,124
We shouldn't push, or else Ebina will
start to suspect something and hate us.

70
00:05:15,224 --> 00:05:18,310
And plus... We've got one person acting weird.

71
00:05:20,107 --> 00:05:20,866
Plus what?

72
00:05:21,586 --> 00:05:23,398
Nothing... just forget it.

73
00:05:23,752 --> 00:05:26,363
I'm sorry that's it's been left up
to the two of you this whole time.

74
00:05:26,388 --> 00:05:28,133
No, please don't worry about it.

75
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:29,986
But perhaps I can make up for it though.

76
00:05:30,146 --> 00:05:32,763
I think that I've come up with
an idea to help you guys out.

77
00:05:32,926 --> 00:05:33,656
What is it?

78
00:05:33,863 --> 00:05:36,564
It's a list of places in Kyoto that girls might like.

79
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,394
It may be useful to them. Here.

80
00:05:39,466 --> 00:05:41,343
Ah, that's my Yukinon!

81
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:43,358
Okay then, I'm going back.

82
00:05:43,395 --> 00:05:45,617
'Kay. We will see you tomorrow then.

83
00:05:45,845 --> 00:05:47,443
Great. See you guys tomorrow.

84
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:01,985
Hello, Hikkio.

85
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:07,728
So... what in the world are you guys trying to do?

86
00:06:08,122 --> 00:06:11,119
I really think you need to try
and stay out of Ebina's business.

87
00:06:13,085 --> 00:06:14,121
You listening to me?

88
00:06:14,146 --> 00:06:15,115
I'm listening.

89
00:06:15,188 --> 00:06:17,594
But we're not really getting into Ebina's business.

90
00:06:17,702 --> 00:06:18,474
You are.

91
00:06:18,989 --> 00:06:20,048
It's obvious.

92
00:06:22,126 --> 00:06:24,041
And it's starting to get really annoying.

93
00:06:24,235 --> 00:06:25,228
Annoying, huh?

94
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,081
You should know there's someone
else who's wanting us to do this.

95
00:06:28,575 --> 00:06:31,624
Anyway it's not like you're the
one who is directly affected by it.

96
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:32,125
What?

97
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:32,529
Huh?

98
00:06:33,067 --> 00:06:34,963
But I will be affected by this.

99
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:40,435
Listen... If you're going out with Yui,
then you've gotten to know Ebina, right?

100
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:43,295
I-I-I'm not going out with her, I
don't know why you're saying that.

101
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,348
You're totally misunderstanding me. So gross.

102
00:06:46,373 --> 00:06:48,558
No way Yui would go out with you.

103
00:06:48,877 --> 00:06:50,093
That's not what I mean.

104
00:06:50,221 --> 00:06:53,904
I mean that you must know how things
are because you're hanging out with Yui.

105
00:06:54,038 --> 00:06:54,665
Gross.

106
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:57,175
<i>Seriously, you don't have to say it like that again.</i>

107
00:06:57,588 --> 00:07:01,410
There are a lot of guys who say
Ebina's a catch if she would just shut up.

108
00:07:01,539 --> 00:07:03,017
So they ask me to introduce them.

109
00:07:03,217 --> 00:07:05,832
But when I try to do that, she always sweetly declines.

110
00:07:06,742 --> 00:07:08,328
I thought she was shy at first...

111
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,535
I was pretty persistent with introducing her...

112
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,574
But the more I tried she would say...

113
00:07:13,607 --> 00:07:15,868
"Hey... enough already, okay?"

114
00:07:16,029 --> 00:07:18,217
She said that to me, like I was someone else.

115
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:19,336
It was odd.

116
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:24,670
Ebina doesn't really talk
about herself... and I don't pry.

117
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,550
But I'm sure she hates this type of thing.

118
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:29,220
<i>But that's a bit wrong.</i>

119
00:07:30,266 --> 00:07:33,265
<i>If you have to sacrifice part of
yourself in order to protect something,</i>

120
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,458
<i>you'd probably give up and throw it all away.</i>

121
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:38,315
<i>Even the relationships you have now.</i>

122
00:07:39,235 --> 00:07:42,598
So listen... we're having a good time. So...

123
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,678
Could you just mind your own business?

124
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:48,963
If that's it, don't worry...

125
00:07:49,261 --> 00:07:49,843
Hm?

126
00:07:50,097 --> 00:07:52,446
Hayama said not to be concerned about it, okay?

127
00:07:52,471 --> 00:07:53,378
What do you mean?

128
00:07:54,299 --> 00:07:56,693
If Hayato says so then I guess we're fine.

129
00:08:00,430 --> 00:08:02,409
Wow, awesome!

130
00:08:03,335 --> 00:08:04,759
We're gonna take a break, aren't we?

131
00:08:04,783 --> 00:08:05,888
What a great view! You can see the whole city from here!

132
00:08:05,912 --> 00:08:07,079
Yes, we are.

133
00:08:08,118 --> 00:08:09,304
Oh, it's Tobecchi!

134
00:08:09,329 --> 00:08:09,671
Huh?

135
00:08:10,789 --> 00:08:12,024
Yahallo!

136
00:08:12,416 --> 00:08:15,129
Isn't it amazing up here? You can see the whole city...

137
00:08:15,403 --> 00:08:18,048
You haven't forgotten what we
talked about, right, Hikitani?

138
00:08:18,162 --> 00:08:19,588
Hm... I haven't.

139
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:24,649
So, how's it going with the guy relationships?

140
00:08:24,709 --> 00:08:25,615
Intimate yet?

141
00:08:25,825 --> 00:08:27,494
We're getting along fine, I guess.

142
00:08:27,642 --> 00:08:29,130
At night we play cards and stuff.

143
00:08:29,203 --> 00:08:31,342
Well, if I can't see it, I can't actually enjoy it!

144
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:32,856
Honestly Hikitani it would be best

145
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:35,178
if you could do a bit more to
gather all the boys in a place

146
00:08:35,203 --> 00:08:37,083
where I can enjoy the view, as well!

147
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:41,197
Well... it looks like we're going
to Arashiyama, so we could do it then.

148
00:08:43,014 --> 00:08:44,048
That'd be perfect!

149
00:08:52,584 --> 00:08:54,488
You're going to spoil your dinner that way.

150
00:08:57,272 --> 00:08:58,865
Then I'll just give the rest to Hikki.

151
00:08:58,890 --> 00:08:59,954
I don't want to eat that.

152
00:09:00,987 --> 00:09:03,468
<i>Why are you taking a weird little bite out of each item?</i>

153
00:09:04,056 --> 00:09:06,396
<i>I would more likely eat it if it were bit in half.</i>

154
00:09:07,243 --> 00:09:09,178
What should I do with all this, Yukinon?

155
00:09:10,396 --> 00:09:11,615
I'll help eat some of it.

156
00:09:18,652 --> 00:09:20,193
Don't just stand there, eat.

157
00:09:20,528 --> 00:09:22,536
I guess I can help eat some too.

158
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:23,407
'Kay.

159
00:09:24,685 --> 00:09:25,179
Here.

160
00:09:46,002 --> 00:09:47,795
<i>It's like you're trying to feed an animal.</i>

161
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:52,318
<i>It's not bad. Food you don't have
to work for is more delicious, anyway.</i>

162
00:10:03,545 --> 00:10:04,698
Wow!

163
00:10:05,005 --> 00:10:06,460
This place is so amazing!

164
00:10:06,657 --> 00:10:07,741
It really is.

165
00:10:07,767 --> 00:10:08,835
Look at the ground.

166
00:10:10,877 --> 00:10:12,357
Oh look a lantern?

167
00:10:15,111 --> 00:10:16,226
It should be here!

168
00:10:16,251 --> 00:10:17,627
This place is perfect!

169
00:10:17,669 --> 00:10:18,388
Whaddya mean?

170
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:23,500
I... mean for a confession... that is.

171
00:10:23,526 --> 00:10:24,939
<i>Why the passive voice?</i>

172
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:27,945
You're right, I think this is a perfect location.

173
00:10:28,324 --> 00:10:29,582
Yeah... that's great!

174
00:10:31,175 --> 00:10:34,228
For a win-or-lose match... here is good.

175
00:10:37,315 --> 00:10:38,944
Oh man, I'm nervous.

176
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:39,792
Oh god!

177
00:10:39,817 --> 00:10:40,870
You're gonna be okay.

178
00:10:40,895 --> 00:10:42,698
And you'll be getting a real girlfriend.

179
00:10:43,056 --> 00:10:45,180
You might even stop hanging out with me, man.

180
00:10:45,537 --> 00:10:47,255
No way, don't even say that!

181
00:10:48,148 --> 00:10:50,190
Oh man, I'm really nervous though!

182
00:10:50,632 --> 00:10:52,959
Wow, even I'm getting a little bit nervous now.

183
00:10:52,984 --> 00:10:53,966
Hey, Tobe.

184
00:10:54,004 --> 00:10:55,748
Huh? Oh no is something the matter?

185
00:10:55,915 --> 00:10:58,001
I think I'm going crazy over here, Hayato!

186
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,779
Well then, just forgot about it.

187
00:10:59,804 --> 00:11:00,838
What the heck!

188
00:11:00,863 --> 00:11:04,705
I thought I'd come and tell you good luck,
but then I looked at your face and lost courage.

189
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:05,983
That's so rude!

190
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:07,914
But it actually helped me relax, somehow.

191
00:11:15,312 --> 00:11:17,040
You're being awfully uncooperative.

192
00:11:18,149 --> 00:11:18,989
Am I really?

193
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:20,190
Yes, you are.

194
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:23,921
It kind of feels like you're
getting in the way on purpose.

195
00:11:24,712 --> 00:11:26,192
I didn't really mean to.

196
00:11:28,312 --> 00:11:29,920
But I like how everything is now.

197
00:11:30,893 --> 00:11:32,313
I like Tobe and Hina,

198
00:11:32,524 --> 00:11:34,694
and the time we all spend together, that's why.

199
00:11:35,916 --> 00:11:39,500
If you can be broken by something like
this, you weren't really friends to begin with.

200
00:11:40,553 --> 00:11:41,419
You might be right...

201
00:11:42,063 --> 00:11:42,528
But...

202
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:46,584
The things you lose will never come back.

203
00:11:47,046 --> 00:11:50,759
It's really weird to think that such a
shallow relationship could possibly work out.

204
00:11:50,982 --> 00:11:51,850
Maybe so.

205
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:54,924
But I don't think of any of my friends as being shallow.

206
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:58,005
For now my environment... really means everything to me.

207
00:11:58,030 --> 00:11:59,463
Nope, they are shallow.

208
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:00,924
So, what happens to Tobe?

209
00:12:02,237 --> 00:12:04,185
I told him so many times to give up.

210
00:12:05,179 --> 00:12:07,471
I don't think Hina's going to open her heart to him.

211
00:12:08,174 --> 00:12:10,333
But you don't know what will happen in the future.

212
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:13,645
I just didn't want Tobe to move so quickly on this yet.

213
00:12:14,545 --> 00:12:15,805
How selfish.

214
00:12:16,244 --> 00:12:18,065
These are just your own circumstances.

215
00:12:18,090 --> 00:12:18,717
Maybe.

216
00:12:19,615 --> 00:12:20,991
Well tell me about you, then?

217
00:12:21,402 --> 00:12:22,471
What would you do here?

218
00:12:24,786 --> 00:12:26,708
It doesn't matter what I'd do in this situation.

219
00:12:27,528 --> 00:12:30,354
<i>If it were up to me, thinking about it would be useless.</i>

220
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:32,471
<i>Hayama and I are different.</i>

221
00:12:32,984 --> 00:12:33,957
<i>As well as, Tobe.</i>

222
00:12:34,865 --> 00:12:36,512
<i>It really doesn't matter what I'd do,</i>

223
00:12:36,698 --> 00:12:40,140
<i>it has zero bearing on this situation
and would be completely useless.</i>

224
00:12:41,037 --> 00:12:44,041
So basically, you don't want
anything to change around here, correct?

225
00:12:45,234 --> 00:12:46,929
Yeah. That's right.

226
00:12:50,427 --> 00:12:53,171
You know, you're the last person
I wanted to ask for help here...

227
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:56,650
Believe me, same here, moron.

228
00:12:57,152 --> 00:12:59,172
<i>I don't know what Hayama is trying to protect.</i>

229
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:02,537
<i>And quite honestly... it's okay if I don't know...</i>

230
00:13:02,830 --> 00:13:04,670
<i>Because there are things I can do.</i>

231
00:13:21,118 --> 00:13:21,671
Tobe.

232
00:13:21,702 --> 00:13:23,697
H-Hikitani...

233
00:13:23,962 --> 00:13:24,966
Seriously, man...

234
00:13:25,241 --> 00:13:26,952
I'm really freakin' nervous here.

235
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:29,590
So, what will you do if you get rejected tonight?

236
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:32,009
Isn't it mean to ask right before I do this?

237
00:13:32,034 --> 00:13:35,003
It's fine, hurry up and answer. Ebina is on her way.

238
00:13:35,063 --> 00:13:36,876
I'm won't give up on pursuing her.

239
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:39,801
You know me I don't usually care about this kind of stuff.

240
00:13:39,826 --> 00:13:42,575
But this time I really mean it, I'm super serious!

241
00:13:43,296 --> 00:13:43,833
Really?

242
00:13:44,327 --> 00:13:46,838
Then you must make sure to give
it your all until the very end.

243
00:13:47,104 --> 00:13:47,651
Yeah!

244
00:13:47,849 --> 00:13:50,050
You're an okay guy after all, Hikitani!

245
00:13:50,324 --> 00:13:51,929
No, I'm not! Idiot!

246
00:13:53,907 --> 00:13:55,895
See you do have some good points.

247
00:13:56,255 --> 00:13:57,743
So, what brought all that about?

248
00:13:58,050 --> 00:13:59,872
Let's not get too excited just yet.

249
00:14:00,301 --> 00:14:01,658
Tobe's gonna get rejected.

250
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:04,728
Well that's a possibility.

251
00:14:04,753 --> 00:14:06,294
I guess... maybe.

252
00:14:07,227 --> 00:14:09,826
But there might be a way things can work out for the best.

253
00:14:10,131 --> 00:14:11,246
And what's that entail?

254
00:14:14,771 --> 00:14:16,945
That's fine, we'll leave it all up to you then.

255
00:14:17,047 --> 00:14:17,518
Yeah.

256
00:14:19,848 --> 00:14:20,277
Huh?

257
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,640
So, um...

258
00:14:49,213 --> 00:14:49,684
Hm?

259
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,098
<i>First of all, Tobe is absolutely going to get rejected.</i>

260
00:14:54,725 --> 00:14:57,038
<i>Tobe has some realization of what could happen...</i>

261
00:14:57,464 --> 00:14:58,317
<i>but the others...</i>

262
00:14:59,151 --> 00:15:02,258
<i>Tobe isn't the only one who thinks
their relationship is important.</i>

263
00:15:02,785 --> 00:15:04,460
<i>That's why she made her request of me.</i>

264
00:15:04,933 --> 00:15:06,986
<i>And that's why he was agonizing over it.</i>

265
00:15:07,419 --> 00:15:08,859
<i>"I don't wanna lose this."</i>

266
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,593
<i>"I wanna hold on to that hand."</i>

267
00:15:11,102 --> 00:15:12,920
<i>The three of them have the same wish.</i>

268
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:13,998
I, um...

269
00:15:14,901 --> 00:15:15,442
Uh...

270
00:15:16,275 --> 00:15:16,923
I...

271
00:15:17,778 --> 00:15:19,946
<i>So in order to keep Tobe from getting rejected...</i>

272
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,041
<i>to keep the group together...</i>

273
00:15:22,335 --> 00:15:23,810
<i>and to stay friends with Ebina...</i>

274
00:15:24,967 --> 00:15:27,113
<i>there's really only one thing I can do...</i>

275
00:15:27,396 --> 00:15:28,326
<i>and that is...</i>

276
00:15:33,702 --> 00:15:35,150
Um... Well, uh...

277
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:38,108
I...

278
00:15:39,294 --> 00:15:40,047
I...

279
00:15:43,198 --> 00:15:43,633
Uh...

280
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:44,553
I, uh...

281
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,242
I've really liked you for a long time!

282
00:15:47,478 --> 00:15:48,669
Please go out with me!

283
00:16:09,246 --> 00:16:10,055
I'm sorry.

284
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,493
I don't want to go out with anyone right now.

285
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:16,330
No matter who were to ask me out, I wouldn't date them.

286
00:16:17,555 --> 00:16:18,185
Huh...

287
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:21,508
If that's all you want, I'm going.

288
00:16:22,119 --> 00:16:22,641
Uh...

289
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:28,811
There you go.

290
00:16:31,643 --> 00:16:33,842
Hikitani... that wasn't right.

291
00:16:34,486 --> 00:16:36,863
I mean it's good I knew before I got rejected,

292
00:16:37,061 --> 00:16:39,753
but still, man... that wasn't right.

293
00:16:39,778 --> 00:16:41,840
It just means now's not the right time.

294
00:16:42,204 --> 00:16:44,675
We can still enjoy the relationships we have right now.

295
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,168
Yeah, I guess, that's true.

296
00:16:46,201 --> 00:16:48,483
I mean she can't feel this way forever.

297
00:16:52,181 --> 00:16:52,901
Hikitani...

298
00:16:53,654 --> 00:16:56,025
Sorry, dude... but I won't let you win her!

299
00:16:59,923 --> 00:17:02,036
Man... I thought I was gonna have a heart attack!

300
00:17:02,067 --> 00:17:02,751
Sorry.

301
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:07,439
I knew that was the only way
you knew how to do it, but still...

302
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:09,538
I'm sorry.

303
00:17:09,607 --> 00:17:11,163
I don't need your apologies.

304
00:17:25,693 --> 00:17:28,155
I hate the way you choose to do things.

305
00:17:29,597 --> 00:17:30,320
Yukinon...

306
00:17:31,709 --> 00:17:34,782
I don't know why... I can't really explain it,

307
00:17:35,969 --> 00:17:38,730
But the way you handle things... I hate it.

308
00:17:42,706 --> 00:17:43,493
Yukinon...

309
00:17:46,183 --> 00:17:47,185
I'm going back.

310
00:18:00,324 --> 00:18:02,667
Uh, I guess we should go back too.

311
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:04,126
Sure.

312
00:18:05,897 --> 00:18:08,583
So uh, that plan wasn't so good, huh?

313
00:18:09,283 --> 00:18:13,230
I know we were all a bit shocked, and
Hina's timing for everything was slightly off...

314
00:18:13,558 --> 00:18:14,115
Yeah.

315
00:18:15,188 --> 00:18:18,602
But... wow, it was still surprising.

316
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:20,366
I thought you were serious for a moment.

317
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,125
Nope, I wasn't.

318
00:18:22,292 --> 00:18:23,232
I know, right?

319
00:18:29,096 --> 00:18:29,531
But...

320
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:32,969
But really...

321
00:18:35,326 --> 00:18:37,572
Don't do these things... not anymore.

322
00:18:40,349 --> 00:18:42,342
That was the most effective way I knew how.

323
00:18:42,797 --> 00:18:43,684
That's all it was.

324
00:18:43,768 --> 00:18:46,670
It doesn't always have to be about being effective.

325
00:18:46,809 --> 00:18:48,664
But some people didn't want a resolution.

326
00:18:49,593 --> 00:18:51,466
And some wanted to keep things how they were.

327
00:18:51,795 --> 00:18:53,587
You can't meet everyone's needs.

328
00:18:53,904 --> 00:18:57,544
<i>While I said that, I realized
something. This didn't make sense.</i>

329
00:18:57,733 --> 00:19:00,144
<i>It was the deception I hated most in the world.</i>

330
00:19:01,052 --> 00:19:02,744
Tobecchi didn't get rejected...

331
00:19:03,349 --> 00:19:05,604
the boys seem to be getting along nicely...

332
00:19:06,164 --> 00:19:08,297
and Hina is totally fine with everything...

333
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,289
So now we can all just get back to normal again...

334
00:19:12,381 --> 00:19:13,948
like nothing has changed at all.

335
00:19:15,526 --> 00:19:15,976
But...

336
00:19:17,118 --> 00:19:18,216
You need to be more...

337
00:19:20,376 --> 00:19:22,946
considerate... of people's feelings!

338
00:19:24,781 --> 00:19:28,613
How do you know so much about
everything, but still not understand that?

339
00:19:31,499 --> 00:19:34,065
I really don't like it... not at all.

340
00:19:55,624 --> 00:19:56,797
Hello hello!

341
00:19:57,702 --> 00:19:58,791
Did I keep you waiting?

342
00:19:59,276 --> 00:19:59,925
No.

343
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:04,411
I thought I should come thank you.

344
00:20:05,069 --> 00:20:06,244
You don't really have to.

345
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:08,958
We didn't really solve what we talked about.

346
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:11,316
On the surface, yes.

347
00:20:11,341 --> 00:20:13,886
But... you knew what I meant.

348
00:20:14,353 --> 00:20:16,536
<i>When she said she wanted the boys to get along...</i>

349
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:18,843
<i>she meant she wanted to keep them at a distance.</i>

350
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:22,475
<i>She also wanted us to try and
prevent Tobe from asking her out.</i>

351
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:25,423
<i>She probably talked to Hayama about it, too..</i>

352
00:20:25,749 --> 00:20:29,584
<i>And that's why he was so troubled the whole
time and only tried to do things half-way.</i>

353
00:20:30,434 --> 00:20:31,532
Thanks for what you did.

354
00:20:31,887 --> 00:20:33,021
You really helped me out.

355
00:20:33,849 --> 00:20:36,004
Tobe may seem like a garbage person,

356
00:20:36,029 --> 00:20:38,123
but I actually think he's a pretty decent guy.

357
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:39,565
No, I know that.

358
00:20:39,590 --> 00:20:43,827
But if I were to date someone right now, it
just wouldn't go well... you know what I mean?

359
00:20:43,906 --> 00:20:44,555
I don't believe-

360
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,515
It wouldn't.

361
00:20:46,508 --> 00:20:48,809
I'm just... a rotten fujoshi.

362
00:20:50,853 --> 00:20:52,866
Well, then... it is what it is.

363
00:20:53,049 --> 00:20:53,590
Yeah.

364
00:20:53,795 --> 00:20:55,050
It is what it is.

365
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:03,747
You know... maybe it would go
well if I went out with you instead.

366
00:21:07,052 --> 00:21:08,148
Don't joke like that.

367
00:21:08,173 --> 00:21:08,624
Uh...

368
00:21:08,922 --> 00:21:12,696
You know if you go and say things like
that to me, I might end up falling for you.

369
00:21:14,361 --> 00:21:15,688
You almost had me there...

370
00:21:15,888 --> 00:21:19,465
I like how you're open with people
who don't matter... at least to you.

371
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:20,478
That's funny.

372
00:21:20,939 --> 00:21:23,697
I actually really like that part of my personality, too.

373
00:21:23,777 --> 00:21:28,596
Sounds like we have that in common since I also like
how I can say things that I don't actually really mean.

374
00:21:31,918 --> 00:21:32,876
I'm good with me...

375
00:21:33,373 --> 00:21:36,335
and I'm happy with how things
are going at this particular moment.

376
00:21:36,885 --> 00:21:39,869
It's been a long time since I've had something like this,

377
00:21:39,934 --> 00:21:41,213
so I don't want to lose it.

378
00:21:41,510 --> 00:21:44,617
I like where I am, and the people who are with me.

379
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:46,921
That's why...

380
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:49,673
Sometimes I hate myself for it.

381
00:21:53,535 --> 00:21:55,985
<i>Everyone, has something that's important to them,</i>

382
00:21:56,691 --> 00:21:57,851
<i>and they don't want to lose it.</i>

383
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:00,691
<i>So they hide... and they pretend.</i>

384
00:22:01,791 --> 00:22:03,291
<i>That's why they tell lies.</i>

385
00:22:03,747 --> 00:22:04,200
<i>But...</i>

386
00:22:05,055 --> 00:22:06,508
<i>The biggest liar of all...</i>

387
00:22:07,839 --> 00:22:08,574
<i>is me.</i>

388
00:23:42,772 --> 00:23:45,205
It's quiet without big bro around.

389
00:23:45,498 --> 00:23:46,932
Right, Kaa?

390
00:23:49,479 --> 00:23:51,766
I wonder if things are going okay for him.

391
00:23:52,118 --> 00:23:52,785
Right, Kaa?

392
00:23:55,776 --> 00:23:57,784
It's boring without him around.

393
00:23:58,216 --> 00:23:59,170
Let's play, Kaa!

394
00:24:00,053 --> 00:24:02,138
Good kitty! You're so cute!

395
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,999
So soft and silky! Good kitty! Good kitty!

396
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,906
Whoa, where are you going, Kaa?

397
00:24:08,873 --> 00:24:10,413
I hope he'll come back soon.
