1
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:26,358
Komachi's Present List:

2
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,419
Bookstore gift card. Gift card.

3
00:00:28,513 --> 00:00:30,099
Major household appliances.

4
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:33,134
But.. The thing I want the most is your eternal happiness!

5
00:00:33,159 --> 00:00:36,170
Eek! I seriously got a whole lot of points for that one!

6
00:00:36,994 --> 00:00:40,584
Oh and also... We're out of detergent,
so pick some up on your way home.

7
00:00:41,923 --> 00:00:42,686
<i>Idiot.</i>

8
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,999
Oh, hey big brother... welcome home!

9
00:02:21,326 --> 00:02:23,357
You shouldn't study at the heated table.

10
00:02:23,382 --> 00:02:26,781
You could end up falling asleep
under it and then catch a nasty cold.

11
00:02:27,005 --> 00:02:29,022
These tables aren't all that good for people.

12
00:02:29,122 --> 00:02:32,630
You say as you make yourself
comfortable at one of those tables.

13
00:02:36,284 --> 00:02:37,557
By the way, Komachi...

14
00:02:38,558 --> 00:02:39,544
What is this here?

15
00:02:39,997 --> 00:02:42,120
Oh that? It's just what it looks like.

16
00:02:42,367 --> 00:02:42,833
Oh?

17
00:02:43,214 --> 00:02:45,857
<i>This girl really wants major household appliances?</i>

18
00:02:46,092 --> 00:02:48,112
<i>She's my sister, but what in the world...</i>

19
00:02:50,055 --> 00:02:51,222
Thank you big brother.

20
00:02:51,766 --> 00:02:55,006
Oh yeah! I almost forgot, Mom
wants you to order the chicken.

21
00:02:55,151 --> 00:02:55,785
Chicken?

22
00:02:55,959 --> 00:02:56,743
And cake, too.

23
00:02:56,768 --> 00:02:57,769
Oh, that too, huh?

24
00:02:57,827 --> 00:03:01,868
I told her I'd do it, but she didn't
listen. Even though I've done it every year.

25
00:03:02,168 --> 00:03:03,761
It's done out of parental love.

26
00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:06,213
She just wants you to focus on your entrance exams.

27
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,557
Stop it.. You're putting a lot of pressure on me.

28
00:03:09,697 --> 00:03:12,852
Sorry. I couldn't come up with anything else to say.

29
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,200
<i>This is difficult.</i>

30
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,230
<i>I guess hearing that from a slacker would piss anyone off.</i>

31
00:03:17,830 --> 00:03:21,173
So you know... at times like these, "I love you" is good.

32
00:03:21,473 --> 00:03:22,586
Is that so?

33
00:03:22,832 --> 00:03:24,125
Well then, I love you, little sis.

34
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:27,267
Well, I don't necessarily feel
the same, but I appreciate it!

35
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:28,712
You're so rude...

36
00:03:32,132 --> 00:03:34,560
Hikki... Are you going to the club today?

37
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,003
<i>I know, I know. I'm going.</i>

38
00:03:40,843 --> 00:03:42,480
Yeah, so we better get moving.

39
00:03:43,623 --> 00:03:44,830
I'm gonna get my bag!

40
00:03:56,487 --> 00:03:58,405
Tell me why you're going ahead of me again?

41
00:03:58,504 --> 00:04:00,437
I'm standing here waiting for you, aren't I?

42
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:05,836
Uh so.. I'll probably leave early today.

43
00:04:06,055 --> 00:04:08,683
I mean.. I might have to leave early for a little while.

44
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,730
You're going to help Iroha, huh?

45
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:12,923
So you know then.

46
00:04:13,147 --> 00:04:15,391
Well it's easy to tell if you just pay attention!

47
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:18,605
Yukinoshita as well?

48
00:04:18,683 --> 00:04:20,385
I'm not sure if she does or not.

49
00:04:20,632 --> 00:04:22,705
She doesn't ever really talk about you.

50
00:04:25,019 --> 00:04:27,067
So then.. You're doing it alone?

51
00:04:28,215 --> 00:04:31,750
I am.. But really I'm just doing it
because I guess I sort of owe it to her.

52
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,367
You don't have to worry about it.

53
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:35,400
I am worried.

54
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:38,663
You have more important things
to concern yourself with than me.

55
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:50,394
I wonder if Yukinon wanted to
be student council president.

56
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:51,969
Don't know.

57
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:58,168
Well either way.. We really should've
accepted that request together as a club.

58
00:04:58,435 --> 00:05:01,972
I Kina feel that.. Old Yukinon
would've liked the challenge.

59
00:05:02,738 --> 00:05:04,456
So why do you think that's the case?

60
00:05:04,945 --> 00:05:05,652
Because...

61
00:05:06,735 --> 00:05:11,561
I believe Yukinon is the type of person who'd
want a chance to try to overcome that sort of thing.

62
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:16,437
So.. I kinda thought that would've
been a really good start, but...

63
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:18,650
You think so?

64
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,353
Sure.. In the past she probably would've.

65
00:05:22,867 --> 00:05:24,310
But I'm not really sure about now.

66
00:05:25,550 --> 00:05:26,307
Yeah...

67
00:05:28,249 --> 00:05:29,398
Yahallo!

68
00:05:30,474 --> 00:05:31,930
Oh hi, glad you're here.

69
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:33,347
Hey.

70
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:44,400
Um...

71
00:05:44,643 --> 00:05:45,437
You got a moment?

72
00:05:49,815 --> 00:05:50,849
Sure, what is it?

73
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:52,733
You okay if I leave early for a while?

74
00:05:53,777 --> 00:05:54,781
Well let's see..

75
00:05:54,932 --> 00:05:57,585
It's not like we are especially
busy at the moment right now.

76
00:05:57,717 --> 00:05:59,344
Well, uh, yeah you're right...

77
00:05:59,488 --> 00:06:02,959
I have a lot I need to... do.
Komachi's cramming for exams...

78
00:06:03,445 --> 00:06:04,342
Oh that's right.

79
00:06:04,367 --> 00:06:06,408
Yea, it's probably better like this, huh?

80
00:06:06,555 --> 00:06:10,395
There's not really anything we as a club
can give to Komachi to help her with those.

81
00:06:10,665 --> 00:06:12,806
I think we should let Hikki do as much as he can!

82
00:06:12,869 --> 00:06:13,838
Okay, Yukinon?

83
00:06:14,133 --> 00:06:15,559
Sure.. Let's do that.

84
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:17,388
Thanks you guys.

85
00:06:21,897 --> 00:06:22,684
Great then!

86
00:06:22,865 --> 00:06:24,774
I'm going to shoot a text over to Komachi.

87
00:06:28,746 --> 00:06:29,568
Where's Isshiki?

88
00:06:29,755 --> 00:06:30,854
I haven't seen her yet.

89
00:06:31,245 --> 00:06:32,394
Weren't you with her?

90
00:06:34,032 --> 00:06:35,282
Have you heard anything?

91
00:06:35,596 --> 00:06:41,550
I was texting her earlier about the meeting...
but no response. Maybe she's still over at practice.

92
00:06:45,198 --> 00:06:47,114
Gotta say it louder! Huh?

93
00:06:52,126 --> 00:06:54,843
She said she had something to
do today and left a while ago.

94
00:06:55,757 --> 00:06:58,058
You're doing a lot to help the student council out, right?

95
00:06:58,386 --> 00:06:59,905
I see.. So you know that?

96
00:06:59,937 --> 00:07:01,981
She wouldn't tell me what she was doing or anything..

97
00:07:02,214 --> 00:07:04,478
But she did insinuate that she was very busy.

98
00:07:04,684 --> 00:07:07,692
Come on now, if you knew about her
being so busy, why didn't you help her out?

99
00:07:07,717 --> 00:07:09,714
She didn't come and actually ask for help.

100
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:11,347
You're the one she's relying on.

101
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,582
She's really not, she's just using me.

102
00:07:13,745 --> 00:07:15,728
It's because you can't refuse anyone, huh?

103
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,645
Hey, that's the kind of club I'm in.

104
00:07:17,988 --> 00:07:21,547
I have no reason to refuse
her. Unlike you, I'm mostly free.

105
00:07:22,018 --> 00:07:23,151
Is that right?

106
00:07:26,263 --> 00:07:27,362
What are you trying to say?

107
00:07:29,213 --> 00:07:31,257
Even though it has nothing to do with practice..

108
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:33,241
You wouldn't have turned her down either.

109
00:07:33,507 --> 00:07:34,334
I dunno know.

110
00:07:35,713 --> 00:07:38,410
I'm really not as good of a guy as you think I am.

111
00:07:40,652 --> 00:07:42,460
I'm counting on you to help her alright?

112
00:07:54,486 --> 00:07:55,103
Isshiki?

113
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,584
Sorry.

114
00:07:57,894 --> 00:07:59,312
Did I keep you waiting for long?

115
00:07:59,337 --> 00:08:01,839
I waited for a while, so I figured I'd look for you.

116
00:08:01,887 --> 00:08:05,968
I think you're supposed to be saying, "No, I
just got here Isshiki"? Come on get with it.

117
00:08:08,571 --> 00:08:10,894
It's not really heavy today, so it's okay.

118
00:08:11,469 --> 00:08:12,141
Are you sure?

119
00:08:12,183 --> 00:08:12,736
Yeah.

120
00:08:13,195 --> 00:08:15,042
It's getting late.. Let's hurry.

121
00:08:38,626 --> 00:08:40,992
We have high hopes for your individual manpower.

122
00:08:41,219 --> 00:08:42,634
But we'll decide together!

123
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,082
So please make suggestions proactively!

124
00:08:45,289 --> 00:08:47,844
We'll do our best president.

125
00:08:50,818 --> 00:08:52,818
<i>You call them here, then neglect them?</i>

126
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:55,226
Should we go ask what we should be doing?

127
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:57,196
Who do we ask? I can't do it.

128
00:08:57,221 --> 00:08:58,897
Let's ask the teacher what to do.

129
00:08:58,991 --> 00:09:01,366
Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll go and ask.

130
00:09:06,401 --> 00:09:07,472
What should we do?

131
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,723
<i>We met these kids during summer
vacation when we volunteered at their camp.</i>

132
00:09:21,295 --> 00:09:24,343
<i>I destroyed the human relationships
surrounding Rumi Tsurumi.</i>

133
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:28,023
<i>I even made Hayama and his
friends play the unlikely villains.</i>

134
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:31,453
Hey... What's the matter with you?

135
00:09:31,663 --> 00:09:32,759
Nothing to worry about.

136
00:09:33,708 --> 00:09:34,933
What should we do here?

137
00:09:34,991 --> 00:09:36,034
<i>Don't ask me.</i>

138
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,276
Sorry to interrupt.

139
00:09:37,301 --> 00:09:38,901
What should the elementary students to do..

140
00:09:38,926 --> 00:09:39,680
President?

141
00:09:39,858 --> 00:09:40,981
Well..Uh..

142
00:09:41,209 --> 00:09:43,476
We haven't really decided on anything yet.

143
00:09:44,231 --> 00:09:47,068
It's best if we confirm things
with them over there, right?

144
00:09:47,408 --> 00:09:51,536
We said we'd take care of them, remember?
We need to come up with something ourselves.

145
00:09:52,162 --> 00:09:53,882
Right. Yes that's true.

146
00:09:54,102 --> 00:09:55,663
Let's think of a task we need done..

147
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,674
Something that they can't get in the way of.

148
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,705
What about decorations.. Or something along those lines?

149
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,648
Yeah ok.. Let's have them to do that then.

150
00:10:06,462 --> 00:10:08,055
<i>This is okay for the time being,</i>

151
00:10:08,757 --> 00:10:12,283
<i>but we can't build past this point, if
we can't decide what the essentials are.</i>

152
00:10:12,895 --> 00:10:15,378
<i>If she's so hesitant about talking to Tamanawa...</i>

153
00:10:16,446 --> 00:10:17,144
Got a moment?

154
00:10:18,872 --> 00:10:19,472
What's up?

155
00:10:19,537 --> 00:10:24,044
Listen.. If we can't decide on what the events
about, even with help, nothing will get done.

156
00:10:24,069 --> 00:10:25,781
Okay, we'll think of something together.

157
00:10:25,806 --> 00:10:29,567
No way... we won't figure it
out by discussing vague ideas.

158
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,355
I think to start we need to narrow down our list
of things we want to accomplish and then review them.

159
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:37,394
However..won't that really limit our field of vision here?

160
00:10:37,849 --> 00:10:41,697
I think we should use a method of exploring
for a solution where we can all contribute.

161
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:43,378
But.. We don't have time.

162
00:10:43,571 --> 00:10:46,900
That's right, we should all get together
and discuss what to do about that, too.

163
00:10:51,356 --> 00:10:55,896
I get why you are in a hurry.. But let's
try to do our best and help everyone out... 'kay?

164
00:10:58,207 --> 00:11:01,519
Ok then.. But that meeting
needs to really happen right now.

165
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:04,109
No problem. So let's start the meeting right away.

166
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:07,576
We were able to collaborate together on the ground design,

167
00:11:07,616 --> 00:11:11,220
so I think we should start by discussing
the more creative parts of the event.

168
00:11:11,793 --> 00:11:14,619
We need something that is both Christmas and uniquely us.

169
00:11:14,719 --> 00:11:19,535
Upon further reflection I feel like the classic
Christmas concert is the standard event for this area.

170
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,767
Don't you guys think Jazz is more Christmas-like?

171
00:11:21,792 --> 00:11:25,879
But shouldn't we take the young-minded
into consideration? Like have a band.

172
00:11:25,973 --> 00:11:28,600
We should get a church choir or borrow a pipe organ.

173
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:29,414
You tell 'em!

174
00:11:29,599 --> 00:11:32,326
Alright. Let's discuss everything one by one.

175
00:11:33,426 --> 00:11:36,117
Isn't it easier to choose from the things they just said?

176
00:11:36,142 --> 00:11:38,123
Instead of rejecting opinions..

177
00:11:38,175 --> 00:11:42,074
We need to accept everyone's proposals
then make something that we can all agree on.

178
00:11:42,150 --> 00:11:43,687
We can't move forward this way...

179
00:11:43,712 --> 00:11:45,429
Some are systematically similar,

180
00:11:45,763 --> 00:11:47,849
so, we should be able to collaborate on this.

181
00:11:47,891 --> 00:11:51,591
What about a Christmas concert that
includes many different genres of music?

182
00:11:51,616 --> 00:11:53,949
If we're looking for a unified solution..

183
00:11:54,116 --> 00:11:56,581
Don't music and musicals go hand in hand together?

184
00:11:56,606 --> 00:11:58,735
Wait, what if we put those two together?

185
00:11:58,777 --> 00:12:00,583
Sort of like a musical movie?

186
00:12:00,656 --> 00:12:02,006
Then I'll take the initiative and...

187
00:12:02,031 --> 00:12:03,223
You go and tell 'em!

188
00:12:09,286 --> 00:12:10,191
Hachiman!

189
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:12,562
Hey, Hachiman!

190
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,046
Heeey!

191
00:12:20,359 --> 00:12:22,385
The heater is turned up a bit high, isn't it?

192
00:12:22,801 --> 00:12:25,202
It's so... hot.

193
00:12:26,388 --> 00:12:28,045
<i>Weird. Really weird.</i>

194
00:12:28,172 --> 00:12:32,320
<i>Also the heater's the only reason why I'm
blushing. Or it's highly likely I have a cold.</i>

195
00:12:32,887 --> 00:12:34,153
<i>And Totsuka's a boy.</i>

196
00:12:34,722 --> 00:12:35,441
<i>Calm down.</i>

197
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,274
<i>I'll calm down and write a haiku.</i>

198
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,580
<i>Maybe I am sick.</i>

199
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:40,319
<i>No way! I cannot be sick!</i>

200
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,486
<i>Okay, I am sick.</i>

201
00:12:41,528 --> 00:12:42,916
<i>I'm totally sick, aren't I?</i>

202
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,691
<i>I'm so sick! I'm writing a haiku!</i>

203
00:12:49,448 --> 00:12:50,748
This is delicious.

204
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:53,991
Hey, you're eating a lot more than usual, aren't you?

205
00:12:54,144 --> 00:12:57,161
Aren't you supposed to eat a lot
food when you're feeling really tired?

206
00:12:57,261 --> 00:12:59,688
Wait you've seemed like you've been kinda tired, lately.

207
00:12:59,921 --> 00:13:00,693
You think so?

208
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:02,809
Did something happen?

209
00:13:04,811 --> 00:13:05,675
Not really.

210
00:13:06,277 --> 00:13:07,442
Don't worry it's nothing.

211
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:14,269
That's ok. You wouldn't say anything even if it did, huh?

212
00:13:14,306 --> 00:13:15,907
No, that's not entirely true.

213
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:20,775
It's just.. I've been very busy helping
Isshiki out with her request on a certain event.

214
00:13:21,093 --> 00:13:22,946
It's more just me supporting her for now.

215
00:13:23,461 --> 00:13:24,083
Really?

216
00:13:24,252 --> 00:13:26,229
Yeah. Don't you worry about me.

217
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:27,436
Ok then.

218
00:13:28,824 --> 00:13:30,579
You're really cool, huh, Hachiman?

219
00:13:30,769 --> 00:13:31,214
What?

220
00:13:32,633 --> 00:13:36,330
Oh! No no, I don't mean that in a strange way!

221
00:13:36,355 --> 00:13:41,164
I mean.. You really do well on your own.
Even when it's tough for you, you don't whine.

222
00:13:41,595 --> 00:13:43,340
I just think that's really cool of you.

223
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,014
That's not true of me at all.

224
00:13:45,414 --> 00:13:47,940
I actually whine a lot and I complain about everything.

225
00:13:48,946 --> 00:13:50,416
Yeah you probably do.

226
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,497
Really.. Tell me if you need help.

227
00:13:55,769 --> 00:13:57,140
<i>I'm "cool.." huh?</i>

228
00:13:57,868 --> 00:13:58,955
<i>There no way.</i>

229
00:13:59,543 --> 00:14:01,803
<i>I think I'm just purely putting on an act.</i>

230
00:14:03,807 --> 00:14:08,792
<i>I stubbornly cling to these strict ideals that
I've created for myself and have drilled into my mind.</i>

231
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,429
<i>However... Yuigahama's strained smile..</i>

232
00:14:14,015 --> 00:14:16,577
<i>The sullen expression that Isshiki sometimes shows..</i>

233
00:14:17,023 --> 00:14:19,349
<i>And the solitary figure of Rumi Tsurumi,</i>

234
00:14:20,315 --> 00:14:26,591
<i>but.. Most of all, it's the quiet, resigned
smile of Yukinoshita that has only made me wonder.</i>

235
00:14:27,662 --> 00:14:30,004
<i>Is it really as ideal as I thought it was?</i>

236
00:14:46,593 --> 00:14:48,166
Oh hi, what're you doing?

237
00:14:48,191 --> 00:14:50,493
Hey. Are you out buying snacks again?

238
00:14:50,722 --> 00:14:53,408
No. It doesn't seem like there's
going to be a meeting today.

239
00:14:53,941 --> 00:14:55,081
Well, that's too bad.

240
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,382
Yeah, too bad, right?

241
00:14:57,582 --> 00:14:59,748
I guess you won't get to score any points with me.

242
00:14:59,773 --> 00:15:02,761
If scoring points with you is
that simple, I don't need them.

243
00:15:04,129 --> 00:15:06,994
Huh? Hey it's Isshiki and Hikigaya.

244
00:15:07,237 --> 00:15:08,196
Oh hello there.

245
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:09,118
Sup guys!

246
00:15:09,143 --> 00:15:12,139
That's right, I always forget
you two knew each other from before.

247
00:15:12,164 --> 00:15:14,171
Yeah, we went to the same junior high school.

248
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:16,582
I'm actually surprised you had any friends at all.

249
00:15:17,462 --> 00:15:19,088
I don't know if I'd say that

250
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,411
but yeah, okay then.

251
00:15:21,449 --> 00:15:24,386
Sounds like there's a story. You have to tell it to me!

252
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:28,869
Come on.. Tell me the story, will ya?!

253
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:31,124
Cut it out already it's... complicated.

254
00:15:37,181 --> 00:15:39,294
Well, it's all in the past now, isn't it?

255
00:15:41,804 --> 00:15:43,610
Hey, tell me about it!

256
00:15:47,747 --> 00:15:48,623
Um...

257
00:15:48,966 --> 00:15:51,661
No matter how you calculate it, we are going over budget.

258
00:15:51,761 --> 00:15:52,714
What should we do here?

259
00:15:52,896 --> 00:15:55,049
We need to scale down or find more funding.

260
00:15:55,362 --> 00:15:58,165
We're really going to have to
make a decision in the next meeting.

261
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:02,185
So um.. It looks like the kids will be
finished with the decorations really soon.

262
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,816
What do you think I should I have them do next?

263
00:16:03,841 --> 00:16:05,190
How 'bout setting up the tree?

264
00:16:05,232 --> 00:16:07,800
Well, the tree is here and ready to be worked on now..

265
00:16:07,854 --> 00:16:10,709
But if we go ahead and put it together,
don't you think it'll be in the way?

266
00:16:10,963 --> 00:16:14,056
How about we ask the center if they
can put it in the entrance for now.

267
00:16:14,209 --> 00:16:16,302
Christmas is next week so might be ok.

268
00:16:16,429 --> 00:16:19,168
We can just move it back to
the venue on the day of the event.

269
00:16:19,573 --> 00:16:21,203
Okay, great I've got it.

270
00:16:22,709 --> 00:16:24,529
<i>This is the wrong way to do this.</i>

271
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,878
<i>I'm the one giving out all the orders.</i>

272
00:16:27,522 --> 00:16:30,685
<i>You can't really call what I'm
doing support or backup for Isshiki.</i>

273
00:16:31,912 --> 00:16:37,063
<i>I need to somehow fix this, so she can take charge
for the rest of it... Thus fulfilling her request.</i>

274
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,727
We thoroughly looked through all the ideas we had,

275
00:16:41,584 --> 00:16:43,779
then sorted them into doable and not.

276
00:16:44,339 --> 00:16:46,869
Most of them look impossible due to the budget, though.

277
00:16:46,894 --> 00:16:48,482
Oh, thank you for doing that.

278
00:16:48,587 --> 00:16:50,964
This makes the issue at hand crystal clear for me.

279
00:16:51,144 --> 00:16:53,282
We shall all come together and
discuss the possible solutions...

280
00:16:53,307 --> 00:16:54,804
We don't have time for this!

281
00:16:54,974 --> 00:16:56,551
We have a week before the event.

282
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,361
Fortunately there are many
options when looking for a band.

283
00:17:00,587 --> 00:17:02,672
If we can come up with the right combination,

284
00:17:02,765 --> 00:17:04,131
we will host a good event.

285
00:17:04,671 --> 00:17:07,146
So, let's refocus and discuss things first.

286
00:17:09,873 --> 00:17:13,277
If we don't make a decision in the next
meeting, nothing will get done in time.

287
00:17:13,421 --> 00:17:14,704
Please keep that in mind.

288
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:15,532
Of course.

289
00:17:18,631 --> 00:17:21,351
<i>Ugh seriously. This is all over.</i>

290
00:17:25,684 --> 00:17:27,564
<i>Is she making the decorations?</i>

291
00:17:31,377 --> 00:17:32,911
Are you making them all by yourself?

292
00:17:50,671 --> 00:17:51,894
Isn't it obvious?

293
00:17:53,083 --> 00:17:55,029
<i>That was a really delayed response.</i>

294
00:17:59,576 --> 00:18:00,616
What are you doing?

295
00:18:00,646 --> 00:18:01,731
Isn't it obvious?

296
00:18:02,767 --> 00:18:04,580
Don't you have anything better to do?

297
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,408
You know, actually I really don't.

298
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:08,407
Lazy.

299
00:18:08,516 --> 00:18:09,427
Leave me alone.

300
00:18:10,596 --> 00:18:12,566
I need to borrow the box cutter, ok?

301
00:18:18,422 --> 00:18:21,618
I'm guessing based on what I
see your liking the younger girls?

302
00:18:21,686 --> 00:18:23,323
Well, I can't say I dislike them.

303
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,327
I've got a little sister, after all.

304
00:18:26,898 --> 00:18:28,083
Are you hitting on me?

305
00:18:28,108 --> 00:18:31,623
I'm so sorry, I really like
older guys, but this is impossible.

306
00:18:31,787 --> 00:18:34,024
Oh please, clearly I wasn't hitting on you Isshiki.

307
00:18:34,084 --> 00:18:36,111
Why are you treating me like that?

308
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:41,205
They're all done, right?

309
00:18:43,204 --> 00:18:44,298
Time to go back then.

310
00:18:45,121 --> 00:18:47,098
Oh... hey Hachiman... Thank you...

311
00:18:47,123 --> 00:18:47,905
So the tree.

312
00:18:48,656 --> 00:18:50,178
I believe they're still working on it..

313
00:18:50,285 --> 00:18:51,768
So why don't you go give 'em a hand?

314
00:18:51,793 --> 00:18:53,470
Uh... yeah.

315
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:04,578
<i>Even using my old methods,</i>

316
00:19:04,787 --> 00:19:06,893
<i>I did manage to save some things,</i>

317
00:19:07,419 --> 00:19:10,463
<i>but..I'm still not sure if it's enough.</i>

318
00:19:11,260 --> 00:19:13,033
<i>What is my responsibility here?</i>

319
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:15,777
<i>I haven't found the answer to that question yet.</i>

320
00:19:31,262 --> 00:19:31,782
Hey.

321
00:19:32,373 --> 00:19:33,156
Good evening.

322
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,720
Uh..you were shopping?

323
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:41,898
Yes.

324
00:19:42,865 --> 00:19:45,366
So what about you? What are you doing out here this late?

325
00:19:46,196 --> 00:19:47,838
I had some things to take care of.

326
00:19:48,656 --> 00:19:49,171
Right.

327
00:19:52,357 --> 00:19:55,036
So tell me... you're helping Isshiki, right?

328
00:19:55,244 --> 00:19:58,122
Yeah. But it's not like I had a choice in it.

329
00:19:58,275 --> 00:20:00,421
You didn't have to lie to me about what you're doing.

330
00:20:01,434 --> 00:20:02,881
I wasn't really lying to you.

331
00:20:03,559 --> 00:20:05,047
Komachi's exams are big.

332
00:20:05,422 --> 00:20:06,208
That's right.

333
00:20:06,372 --> 00:20:08,305
You didn't technically lie to us.

334
00:20:08,731 --> 00:20:10,586
I'm sorry I took her request on my own.

335
00:20:10,865 --> 00:20:12,015
I don't really mind.

336
00:20:12,528 --> 00:20:14,922
Seriously what you do with your free time is your own.

337
00:20:14,963 --> 00:20:17,278
It's not like I have any control what you do.

338
00:20:17,881 --> 00:20:19,418
I don't have a say in your life.

339
00:20:20,305 --> 00:20:21,335
Unless you mean..

340
00:20:23,222 --> 00:20:24,914
You really just need my permission?

341
00:20:25,496 --> 00:20:27,731
No. I just really wanted you to know okay?

342
00:20:29,717 --> 00:20:30,392
I see.

343
00:20:30,847 --> 00:20:33,311
But there's no need to apologize about it, though.

344
00:20:33,774 --> 00:20:38,861
Anyways... I'm sure that Isshiki finds it a
lot easier to work with you rather than all of us.

345
00:20:41,698 --> 00:20:44,323
You're just really good at resolving things by yourself.

346
00:20:45,487 --> 00:20:46,767
It's always been like that.

347
00:20:47,316 --> 00:20:49,095
I haven't really resolved anything.

348
00:20:50,008 --> 00:20:52,715
Also, I only do things alone because I am alone.

349
00:20:53,469 --> 00:20:54,456
Aren't you the same?

350
00:20:56,065 --> 00:20:56,947
Actually I'm...

351
00:20:59,486 --> 00:21:00,434
not like that.

352
00:21:01,595 --> 00:21:03,647
I always act like I could do anything,

353
00:21:04,464 --> 00:21:06,624
like I totally understand everything.

354
00:21:07,162 --> 00:21:08,641
That's not true, Yukinoshita...

355
00:21:12,581 --> 00:21:14,300
How about taking a break from the club?

356
00:21:15,576 --> 00:21:19,265
If you're there trying to watch over
us.. You're really just wasting your time.

357
00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:22,148
I'm really not, that's not my intention here.

358
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:23,718
But you are doing that.

359
00:21:24,575 --> 00:21:26,109
And you've done it since the beginning.

360
00:21:26,934 --> 00:21:27,843
So, that's why..

361
00:21:30,536 --> 00:21:34,118
It's fine.. If you stop forcing
yourself just for our sake.

362
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:38,426
If we can be torn apart this
easy.. We weren't close to begin with.

363
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:39,983
Am I wrong?

364
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,550
So.. See ya around ok?

365
00:23:41,992 --> 00:23:44,474
We really need to confirm the agenda for the next meeting.

366
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:47,813
Wow, an agenda? That's like super important, isn't it?

367
00:23:47,866 --> 00:23:50,192
We'll then share the updated agenda through the cloud.

368
00:23:50,223 --> 00:23:52,178
The cloud! That sounds so powerful!

369
00:23:52,210 --> 00:23:53,918
We should upload a digest as well.

370
00:23:53,991 --> 00:23:56,386
A digest? Sounds delicious!

371
00:23:56,411 --> 00:23:57,521
Take a decent buffer...

372
00:23:57,546 --> 00:23:59,490
Buffer? I'm down with that!

373
00:23:59,605 --> 00:24:01,658
Okay. I think, we've got it.

374
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:04,622
So, let us all brainstorm and then commit to the results.

375
00:24:04,647 --> 00:24:05,927
Commit to the results!

376
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:07,347
You tell 'em!

377
00:24:07,636 --> 00:24:09,617
So.. What're we discussing?
