1
00:00:03,893 --> 00:00:06,140
You know how it's been super dry out lately.

2
00:00:06,513 --> 00:00:09,510
So... Yumiko decided to bring in a humidifier.

3
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:12,573
Now.. During class it always feels nice and humid.

4
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,060
The ones now are, uh...

5
00:00:14,398 --> 00:00:15,818
<i>There's that smile.</i>

6
00:00:15,892 --> 00:00:17,596
<i>The one that's been there since that day.</i>

7
00:00:18,715 --> 00:00:21,002
<i>Our daily routine hasn't changed much either.</i>

8
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:24,288
<i>All we do is try to fight the urge to run away.</i>

9
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:25,094
Hey, Hikki!

10
00:00:27,526 --> 00:00:28,381
I'm listening.

11
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:33,131
It's a USB. Why do we have to get something
that's so American to power our things?

12
00:00:33,156 --> 00:00:36,606
Ah yeah, that it! A USB.

13
00:00:36,725 --> 00:00:38,998
You can also charge cell phones by USB.

14
00:00:41,339 --> 00:00:43,557
By the way, what are you doing for Christmas huh?

15
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:44,444
Let's see...

16
00:00:44,468 --> 00:00:47,142
<i>I don't want to use the things I've lost as an excuse.</i>

17
00:00:48,071 --> 00:00:51,234
<i>That's why I'm putting up more defenses
and acting like everything is normal.</i>

18
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,218
<i>It's the only thing I know how to do.</i>

19
00:00:53,934 --> 00:00:55,389
Christmas break, huh?

20
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:57,351
You're not gonna be here right Ebina?

21
00:00:57,553 --> 00:00:59,068
And what are you guys doing?

22
00:00:59,924 --> 00:01:01,414
I'm going to be busy too.

23
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:03,253
H-Hayato...

24
00:01:03,576 --> 00:01:05,603
Do you have special plans or something?

25
00:01:05,842 --> 00:01:07,050
H-Huh.

26
00:01:09,199 --> 00:01:09,782
Hikki?

27
00:01:09,807 --> 00:01:10,229
Hm?

28
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:15,902
Why are you staring at me like that?

29
00:02:48,074 --> 00:02:51,242
Uh.. I'm not.. I mean I'm not really staring at you.

30
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:55,494
No, you were totally creepy staring
at me, frankly it was scaring me a bit.

31
00:02:55,581 --> 00:02:57,739
Well doesn't that mean you were staring at me too?

32
00:02:57,976 --> 00:02:59,432
Huh? No, well...

33
00:02:59,966 --> 00:03:01,873
I could feel your eyeballs on me!

34
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:04,270
Burning a hole through me and giving me the chills.

35
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,554
<i>You do know those two things are completely different.</i>

36
00:03:07,402 --> 00:03:09,560
Anyways, is there something you need from me?

37
00:03:09,585 --> 00:03:11,257
No there's nothing I need right now.

38
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:13,559
You, just got my attention, that's all.

39
00:03:13,642 --> 00:03:14,285
Really?

40
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:17,717
<i>Really.. Something suddenly hit me though.</i>

41
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:21,023
<i>Why was I looking over at them so intently?</i>

42
00:03:22,615 --> 00:03:23,300
Morning.

43
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,294
Morning, Saika.

44
00:03:25,344 --> 00:03:26,333
Hey, morning.

45
00:03:28,049 --> 00:03:28,650
What's up?

46
00:03:28,996 --> 00:03:31,258
I noticed you two talking together just now...

47
00:03:31,487 --> 00:03:33,077
and I realized how rare that is.

48
00:03:33,592 --> 00:03:34,234
Really?

49
00:03:35,467 --> 00:03:36,561
Did something happen?

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:38,367
No, nothing happened!

51
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:41,710
W-we're just talking about
our club activities. That's all.

52
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,423
Oh, club activities?

53
00:03:43,683 --> 00:03:46,964
Well if you're still doing things like
you were before, then that's good, right?

54
00:03:49,288 --> 00:03:52,520
So, anyways! If there's anything you need, come see us!

55
00:03:54,006 --> 00:03:55,706
Actually, you know something?

56
00:03:56,016 --> 00:03:58,241
You can drop by even if you don't need anything.

57
00:03:58,856 --> 00:04:00,477
You are always welcome at the club.

58
00:04:00,502 --> 00:04:02,322
Where'd all this motivation come from!

59
00:04:03,545 --> 00:04:04,410
See you later.

60
00:04:07,044 --> 00:04:08,398
Oh hey, Hikki.

61
00:04:11,329 --> 00:04:13,283
So, um.. Wanna head off to club?

62
00:04:30,525 --> 00:04:32,404
Ok... bye!

63
00:04:32,429 --> 00:04:33,511
Bye!

64
00:04:44,306 --> 00:04:46,062
Hey, why did you leave me behind?

65
00:04:46,087 --> 00:04:48,066
I didn't. I was waiting right here for you.

66
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:49,288
Yeah, but that's not...

67
00:04:50,508 --> 00:04:52,409
Well uh... guess that's okay.

68
00:04:53,962 --> 00:04:54,640
Let's go.

69
00:05:03,475 --> 00:05:05,298
By the way, how's the lunch break going?

70
00:05:05,412 --> 00:05:08,322
Huh? Oh.. It's the same as always.

71
00:05:09,004 --> 00:05:09,602
That's good.

72
00:05:12,571 --> 00:05:13,576
Um, hey?

73
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,131
Hm?

74
00:05:15,105 --> 00:05:16,263
Oh, it's nothing.

75
00:05:18,096 --> 00:05:18,763
Ok.

76
00:05:29,302 --> 00:05:30,956
Yahallo, We're here!

77
00:05:36,584 --> 00:05:39,896
So today Saika said that Hikki and I
talking in the classroom is like, a rare thing!

78
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,708
<i>How long is this gonna go on?</i>

79
00:05:41,845 --> 00:05:42,880
I guess that is probably rare for you guys.

80
00:05:42,904 --> 00:05:44,451
<i>How long can this go on?</i>

81
00:05:44,691 --> 00:05:46,188
Not really, right, Hikki?

82
00:05:46,547 --> 00:05:49,772
<i>What will happen to us if we
can't keep continuing like this?</i>

83
00:05:50,691 --> 00:05:51,665
You were tired?!

84
00:05:52,027 --> 00:05:56,141
<i>I probably felt the need to look at Hayama
and his group hoping they'd teach me something.</i>

85
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:59,878
<i>Like how do I smooth over the things that have flaked off?</i>

86
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:01,364
Huh?

87
00:06:02,076 --> 00:06:02,734
Come in.

88
00:06:03,915 --> 00:06:06,564
I need help. I'm in some serious trouble!

89
00:06:06,631 --> 00:06:10,888
Come on, please help me, I'm in big
big trouble and I don't know what to do.

90
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,880
A Christmas event?

91
00:06:14,425 --> 00:06:15,158
Yes.

92
00:06:15,733 --> 00:06:18,075
That's your first job as student council president?

93
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:21,478
Yeah we're supposed to be
partnering with Kaihin High on this.

94
00:06:21,698 --> 00:06:26,313
It's like.. Something that's going to bring
the elderly and nursery school kids together.

95
00:06:27,202 --> 00:06:29,469
All right, who came up with that idea?

96
00:06:29,533 --> 00:06:31,513
They came up with it obviously!

97
00:06:31,538 --> 00:06:33,832
No way I would've ever come up with something like that!

98
00:06:33,857 --> 00:06:34,792
It figures.

99
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:38,769
So.. I was definitely prepared
to turn down their proposal, right?

100
00:06:38,865 --> 00:06:41,577
I mean I have Christmas plans too, after all.

101
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,381
Prepared to turn their proposal down?

102
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:44,951
That's quite a selfish reason.

103
00:06:45,114 --> 00:06:48,314
But then Ms. Hiratsuka jumped in and said we had to do it.

104
00:06:48,398 --> 00:06:50,629
Ah of course, she's involved in this.

105
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:55,196
So, we tried getting together to plan
it.. But it's not working out very well.

106
00:06:55,221 --> 00:06:56,871
It can go that way with other schools.

107
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,045
Don't worry about it.

108
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,060
I don't get why you didn't you bother
talking to Shiromeguri before coming to us?

109
00:07:02,085 --> 00:07:05,077
U-Uh, well. How shall I put this in the best way?

110
00:07:06,301 --> 00:07:10,942
Oh wait I know! She's got entrance exams which
means I really shouldn't be bothering her, right?

111
00:07:10,967 --> 00:07:12,262
<i>U-uh, well...</i>

112
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,832
<i>You guys she's just really hard to deal with, you know?</i>

113
00:07:15,156 --> 00:07:18,320
You guys are the only ones I
can actually depend on around here!

114
00:07:32,619 --> 00:07:33,685
Let's see here.

115
00:07:34,264 --> 00:07:36,565
We understand the basics of your situation.

116
00:07:37,212 --> 00:07:38,071
What should we do?

117
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:39,895
It sounds great! Let's do it!

118
00:07:40,257 --> 00:07:42,841
I feel like we haven't had a good request in forever.

119
00:07:43,285 --> 00:07:45,910
Lately it's like nothing's really been happening.

120
00:07:46,428 --> 00:07:48,040
It'll be like old times..

121
00:07:48,922 --> 00:07:50,401
We should give it a try...

122
00:07:50,796 --> 00:07:54,291
I mean.. Um.. That's cool.. Isn't it?

123
00:07:56,365 --> 00:07:56,993
Yes.

124
00:07:57,945 --> 00:07:59,952
All right.. I think we should do it.

125
00:08:02,476 --> 00:08:03,962
I don't really think we should take it.

126
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:06,852
This is the student council's problem.

127
00:08:07,155 --> 00:08:12,177
In my own opinion I don't think Isshiki should be so
dependent on others first thing after becoming president.

128
00:08:12,301 --> 00:08:14,265
Wh-What do you mean?

129
00:08:15,192 --> 00:08:17,658
You can't expect us to do everything for you.

130
00:08:17,758 --> 00:08:19,642
At the most, we just lend a hand.

131
00:08:19,828 --> 00:08:21,638
Anyways, this is your job now.

132
00:08:21,663 --> 00:08:23,199
So time for you to go away.

133
00:08:23,224 --> 00:08:26,161
I only became president because you told me to, remember.

134
00:08:26,186 --> 00:08:28,105
Which means you have to do something here.

135
00:08:28,632 --> 00:08:30,045
<i>I guess she's right about that.</i>

136
00:08:30,605 --> 00:08:33,205
<i>Of course, I would need to
take responsibility for Isshiki.</i>

137
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:39,341
<i>But that being the case... There's one other
person that I feel I must take responsibility for.</i>

138
00:08:42,115 --> 00:08:44,254
Instead of the club helping out with this issue..

139
00:08:44,534 --> 00:08:47,228
What if I just took your request
for help on this event, myself?

140
00:08:47,253 --> 00:08:49,710
Huh? I guess that'll work.

141
00:08:50,819 --> 00:08:53,474
Plus, if it's just you, it'll be much easier for me.

142
00:08:54,434 --> 00:08:56,426
I mean I'd be much more relaxed.

143
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:57,205
And I know I can depend on you.

144
00:08:57,242 --> 00:08:59,354
Hey.. It's too late to fix what you said.

145
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:01,189
What about asking Hayama?

146
00:09:01,623 --> 00:09:04,369
Wouldn't this have been the perfect
time to ask him to help you out?

147
00:09:06,182 --> 00:09:11,167
It'll be a difficult job, and I know he's busy now
so I didn't really want to go and bother him with it.

148
00:09:11,192 --> 00:09:13,547
<i>But you don't mind bothering me.. Do you?</i>

149
00:09:13,953 --> 00:09:17,336
<i>Look at her.. Talking about
not wanting to be a bother to him.</i>

150
00:09:18,163 --> 00:09:20,707
<i>I suppose she really is just a girl in love.</i>

151
00:09:21,174 --> 00:09:22,234
I admire her.

152
00:09:22,827 --> 00:09:27,288
Besides, the "adorable ditz" act only
works so long and usually just for easy things.

153
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:29,942
You know like making silly mistakes, stuff like that.

154
00:09:30,215 --> 00:09:33,688
If I ask for help with a lot of work,
it will make me seem really annoying.

155
00:09:34,042 --> 00:09:35,349
Oh right there's that?

156
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,931
<i>Could she be any more scheming?</i>

157
00:09:36,956 --> 00:09:37,749
<i>Give it back!</i>

158
00:09:37,774 --> 00:09:39,162
<i>Gimme me back my praise!</i>

159
00:09:40,903 --> 00:09:43,419
Ok.. Then we will meet at the front gate later.

160
00:09:43,444 --> 00:09:45,347
Wait hold on, we're going to start today?

161
00:09:45,372 --> 00:09:47,112
We don't have a lot of time left.

162
00:09:48,072 --> 00:09:50,538
All right then, but I need to change up the meeting place.

163
00:09:51,719 --> 00:09:55,417
I'd get embarrassed if my friends saw us
leaving together and started gossiping about it.

164
00:09:56,077 --> 00:09:59,211
<i>Hm, does she not understand because of our age gap?</i>

165
00:10:00,434 --> 00:10:05,251
<i>Wow, where's the "but you don't have any
friends" reply? She's taking me seriously!</i>

166
00:10:05,578 --> 00:10:06,775
Okay, fine then.

167
00:10:07,662 --> 00:10:09,520
Do you know where the community center is?

168
00:10:09,966 --> 00:10:10,789
Let's meet there.

169
00:10:11,156 --> 00:10:13,111
Great. I'll head there when I'm ready.

170
00:10:13,544 --> 00:10:15,430
Ok then.. I'm counting on you!

171
00:10:16,669 --> 00:10:18,572
<i>That's enough out of you for now..</i>

172
00:10:22,452 --> 00:10:23,759
What did Iroha say?

173
00:10:24,192 --> 00:10:27,120
She whined a lot at first.. But finally accepted it.

174
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:28,209
Okay.

175
00:10:28,582 --> 00:10:31,777
I thought it would be fun if we could
do something, since it's been forever.

176
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,954
I'm sure something else will come up soon.

177
00:10:37,082 --> 00:10:40,856
Maybe.. But it might be better
to not get any requests at all.

178
00:10:41,403 --> 00:10:43,478
So, time can pass with no troubles.

179
00:10:44,533 --> 00:10:45,306
Maybe so.

180
00:10:45,766 --> 00:10:47,667
<i>If that's the case, what have I...</i>

181
00:10:48,443 --> 00:10:49,359
<i>I mean we...</i>

182
00:10:50,510 --> 00:10:53,377
<i>What have we been doing in here for all of this time?</i>

183
00:11:04,642 --> 00:11:07,695
Oh hey there.. I'm so sorry to keep you waiting.

184
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,953
I just had to do some quick shopping.

185
00:11:11,435 --> 00:11:12,917
Hey.. Don't worry about it.

186
00:11:14,569 --> 00:11:15,095
Huh?

187
00:11:15,258 --> 00:11:16,794
What's that annoying face for?

188
00:11:17,907 --> 00:11:21,262
Didn't that "sigh" of yours mean "This
thing is heavy, so carry it for me"?

189
00:11:21,395 --> 00:11:22,925
Oh, it wasn't..

190
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:24,503
That was simply me being me.

191
00:11:26,283 --> 00:11:28,479
Where you trying to hit on me again just now?

192
00:11:28,504 --> 00:11:32,295
It almost made my heart skip a beat,
but seriously it won't work out for us.

193
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,611
Uh..really?

194
00:11:34,677 --> 00:11:37,068
<i>How many times am I going to be rejected by her?</i>

195
00:11:39,927 --> 00:11:41,760
Oh, well th-thank you.

196
00:11:42,133 --> 00:11:44,447
It's fine. I'm just doing my job.

197
00:11:44,713 --> 00:11:46,201
You're so reliable.

198
00:11:46,407 --> 00:11:49,336
I guess I'll just have to rely
on you for the next task, as well.

199
00:11:51,755 --> 00:11:52,889
Good evening everyone!

200
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:08,701
I'm Tamanawa... Kaihin High
School's student council president.

201
00:12:09,124 --> 00:12:09,707
Welcome.

202
00:12:09,892 --> 00:12:11,487
Well uh... Hello there.

203
00:12:11,693 --> 00:12:12,817
I'm so honored...

204
00:12:13,358 --> 00:12:16,599
To be able to blaze this trail
with such fresh and eager recruits.

205
00:12:16,676 --> 00:12:19,460
The synergy born from our partnership of mutual respect...

206
00:12:19,893 --> 00:12:22,479
will be exactly what we need for this event to succeed.

207
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,285
<i>He's really taking it seriously, isn't he?</i>

208
00:12:25,758 --> 00:12:27,025
Can I talk to you, Iroha?

209
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:27,885
Sure.

210
00:12:29,318 --> 00:12:30,755
Huh? Hikigaya?

211
00:12:33,718 --> 00:12:34,467
Hey...

212
00:12:35,714 --> 00:12:37,235
You're in the student council?

213
00:12:37,558 --> 00:12:38,065
Nope.

214
00:12:38,203 --> 00:12:39,412
Hey, me neither.

215
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:42,542
A friend of mine invited me to come along so why not!

216
00:12:43,424 --> 00:12:45,112
Hold up? Are you here alone?

217
00:12:45,137 --> 00:12:47,056
Yeah, I almost always am.

218
00:12:48,421 --> 00:12:49,190
What? That's really funny!

219
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,196
No, it's not.

220
00:12:51,262 --> 00:12:51,990
See ya.

221
00:12:54,712 --> 00:12:57,930
Hikigaya... Wow, you actually know someone?

222
00:12:57,955 --> 00:13:00,747
<i>That sounded more like "you actually know someone?"</i>

223
00:13:00,772 --> 00:13:03,782
<i>Than "you know someone here," you can quit now.</i>

224
00:13:04,173 --> 00:13:06,768
<i>Also.. Don't you remember you've met her once before.</i>

225
00:13:07,774 --> 00:13:10,216
Then tell me who's that girl you're hanging with?

226
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,597
Yeah well... she's just an old classmate.

227
00:13:13,723 --> 00:13:14,328
Really?

228
00:13:15,736 --> 00:13:17,814
Oh.. Great we're finally starting..

229
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:20,064
Come on let's go get us a good seat.

230
00:13:20,317 --> 00:13:22,130
I'd rather sit over in the corner.

231
00:13:23,865 --> 00:13:28,593
Ok.. Let's go ahead and start where we left
off the other day and do a bit more brainstorming.

232
00:13:29,490 --> 00:13:33,354
First is the event concept.. Are
there any ideas on what it should entail.

233
00:13:40,214 --> 00:13:43,783
I think considering what is expected
of us high school leaders now days,

234
00:13:43,808 --> 00:13:46,683
we should have some really
innovative ideas flowing around here.

235
00:13:48,085 --> 00:13:49,302
Oh, I'd like to add..

236
00:13:49,467 --> 00:13:54,314
We really must think of a win-win situation for
both us and the community as a precondition here.

237
00:13:55,772 --> 00:13:59,775
We'll need to evaluate all the
logistical efficiencies strategically, too.

238
00:14:01,449 --> 00:14:02,958
What are they all talking about?

239
00:14:02,992 --> 00:14:07,992
Oh, that? You know... they are just proposing
a bunch of ideas back and forth to one another.

240
00:14:09,535 --> 00:14:12,809
Tell me... isn't there something
more important for us to focus on?

241
00:14:19,174 --> 00:14:21,979
Let's use logical thinking and adopt an ordered mindset.

242
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:23,939
<i>Aren't those actually the same thing?</i>

243
00:14:24,259 --> 00:14:26,093
<i>How many ways can you think logically?</i>

244
00:14:26,211 --> 00:14:29,441
Think from the guest's POV and
regard strategy from a customer's view.

245
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,614
<i>Seriously, those are the exact same things.</i>

246
00:14:31,834 --> 00:14:33,609
<i>How many times can you become a customer?</i>

247
00:14:33,634 --> 00:14:35,764
Let's consider the pros and cons of outsourcing.

248
00:14:35,837 --> 00:14:38,885
The current method is rather
strict scheme-wise. What should we do?

249
00:14:38,965 --> 00:14:40,965
We may end up having to reschedule it.

250
00:14:41,518 --> 00:14:43,251
Shouldn't we go for a bigger buffer?

251
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:45,874
Yes, we need to take a more holistic approach.

252
00:14:58,168 --> 00:15:00,409
Did you get an idea of what all of this is about?

253
00:15:00,434 --> 00:15:02,249
Nope, I didn't understand a thing.

254
00:15:02,369 --> 00:15:05,535
Yeah.. They're talking about
pretty complicated stuff, I guess.

255
00:15:05,582 --> 00:15:10,803
Though I've found saying... "wow" or "I'll have to do
my best too" has worked out pretty well for me, so far.

256
00:15:11,364 --> 00:15:14,928
Also if you always make sure to reply
to their texts, then you're good to go.

257
00:15:14,981 --> 00:15:16,830
Someone is gonna call you out on that.

258
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:20,720
Yea maybe, but you know you're
kind of like that too sometimes.

259
00:15:20,833 --> 00:15:24,014
You seem to be smart, or least
have a high level of awareness.

260
00:15:24,039 --> 00:15:28,911
Please you say that. I'm not highly
aware at all. I'm just highly SELF-aware.

261
00:15:29,024 --> 00:15:31,447
Whatever.. I've kinda lost interest.

262
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:36,664
So anyways.. I gathered up the stuff we
need to do, so let's get started with that.

263
00:15:36,772 --> 00:15:37,281
Oh?

264
00:15:38,102 --> 00:15:38,736
What is it?

265
00:15:41,062 --> 00:15:43,028
You really get along well with them, don't you?

266
00:15:43,954 --> 00:15:45,619
Yeah.. I guess so.

267
00:15:46,883 --> 00:15:49,892
Uh... Wait I seem to recall
that you taught me a lesson once..

268
00:15:49,917 --> 00:15:52,892
That an eager and cute young
girl will always get extra points!

269
00:15:52,917 --> 00:15:54,274
I don't think I taught you that.

270
00:15:55,036 --> 00:15:57,522
Anyway... it looks like you don't need me here.

271
00:15:57,685 --> 00:15:59,885
Uh.. Well actually...

272
00:16:02,199 --> 00:16:04,682
Iroha, can you please take care of this?

273
00:16:04,882 --> 00:16:06,861
Also, this, this, and this.

274
00:16:07,386 --> 00:16:08,561
O-Okay.

275
00:16:10,361 --> 00:16:12,536
If you don't understand something, just ask.

276
00:16:12,757 --> 00:16:14,846
I'll be happy to explain everything for you.

277
00:16:21,865 --> 00:16:25,434
There you have it. Looks like we
have to organize the minutes, too.

278
00:16:26,243 --> 00:16:28,155
Can you, please take care of this?

279
00:16:31,793 --> 00:16:34,560
<i>The student council doesn't
seem to be functioning very well.</i>

280
00:16:35,411 --> 00:16:37,416
<i>I'm sure they're still getting used to one another.</i>

281
00:16:37,736 --> 00:16:40,576
<i>But I think that's preventing any
meaningful discussion amongst them.</i>

282
00:16:41,214 --> 00:16:43,484
Thanks, I'll be sure to check it and let you know.

283
00:16:43,904 --> 00:16:46,592
That's great.. We should also talk about moving forward.

284
00:16:46,766 --> 00:16:47,455
Okay.

285
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,714
Actually. Never mind.

286
00:16:58,442 --> 00:16:59,526
He's our VP.

287
00:16:59,817 --> 00:17:01,377
He seems like he's kind of tough.

288
00:17:01,664 --> 00:17:04,096
I guess they don't think very highly of me in here.

289
00:17:04,816 --> 00:17:06,553
It's always like that at the beginning.

290
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,777
It will improve eventually.

291
00:17:28,889 --> 00:17:29,984
Hey there!

292
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:35,174
Your reaction was really lame just now.

293
00:17:35,633 --> 00:17:37,639
I'm really tired of you acting rude to me.

294
00:17:37,699 --> 00:17:41,003
Oh, come on.. I was only just being myself you know.

295
00:17:49,181 --> 00:17:53,142
You know.. You say I'm sly but
you're acting pretty sly yourself.

296
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:56,734
Come on, I was just being myself then, you know.

297
00:17:56,921 --> 00:17:58,760
Hey.. Wait up for me.

298
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:03,038
We still have many items that are not solidified yet,

299
00:18:03,351 --> 00:18:05,672
So let's continue yesterday's brainstorming.

300
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:08,573
This needs to be super dazzling
since we're working so hard.

301
00:18:08,615 --> 00:18:10,242
Oh, yeah definitely!

302
00:18:10,284 --> 00:18:13,629
We need something really big, or like bright and flashy!

303
00:18:17,154 --> 00:18:20,453
Now that you mention it maybe we
did decide on something too small.

304
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:22,266
<i>Huh? We decided on something?</i>

305
00:18:22,724 --> 00:18:26,717
<i>The minutes don't say anything besides "logical
thinking" and other useless junk like that.</i>

306
00:18:27,731 --> 00:18:30,099
I actually have no idea of what we're doing here.

307
00:18:30,124 --> 00:18:33,554
Let's just say I'm pretty sure we
haven't decided on anything specific.

308
00:18:34,014 --> 00:18:35,975
I think we need to do something bigger.

309
00:18:36,162 --> 00:18:36,922
Your thoughts?

310
00:18:37,205 --> 00:18:38,242
Uh...

311
00:18:39,881 --> 00:18:41,321
I guess that sounds good.

312
00:18:42,744 --> 00:18:46,054
We don't exactly have enough time or
man power to make this event bigger.

313
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,821
No, no. You've got it all wrong.

314
00:18:48,041 --> 00:18:49,722
When in a brainstorming session..

315
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:52,091
You never reject other people's ideas.

316
00:18:52,339 --> 00:18:56,266
If time and lack of people make it
hard to do things on a wider scale,

317
00:18:56,412 --> 00:19:00,286
then we need to stop and talk about
how to deal with the obstacles before us.

318
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:02,637
We shouldn't just jump to conclusions.

319
00:19:02,870 --> 00:19:04,657
So, we can't accept your opinions.

320
00:19:04,682 --> 00:19:06,373
O-Okay.

321
00:19:06,719 --> 00:19:08,923
<i>But he seems perfectly okay shooting me down.</i>

322
00:19:09,430 --> 00:19:11,275
Let's discuss how we can make this happen.

323
00:19:13,459 --> 00:19:15,766
How about bringing in more high schools from the area?

324
00:19:16,005 --> 00:19:19,674
<i>Oh man. Why do these highly-aware
people always like to socialize?</i>

325
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,792
<i>There's no advantage of getting
more high schools to participate.</i>

326
00:19:23,386 --> 00:19:25,965
<i>However.. Frank opposition will be shut down.</i>

327
00:19:26,746 --> 00:19:29,068
Then we head in the direction
of filling the generational gap.

328
00:19:29,093 --> 00:19:30,246
That sounds great!

329
00:19:30,673 --> 00:19:32,407
<i>So.. With that in mind,</i>

330
00:19:32,645 --> 00:19:34,367
<i>I'll play by their rules...</i>

331
00:19:34,744 --> 00:19:36,693
Hey, I've just had a sudden idea,

332
00:19:37,052 --> 00:19:39,330
It's a counter to the proposal you had earlier,

333
00:19:40,034 --> 00:19:41,680
I think a more streamlined mindshare

334
00:19:41,705 --> 00:19:45,982
between our two high schools would help us really
leverage the most synergy and growth potential.

335
00:19:47,314 --> 00:19:48,174
Thoughts on that?

336
00:19:53,137 --> 00:19:53,917
I see.

337
00:19:54,584 --> 00:19:57,700
So, maybe we should just forget
about high schools. Colleges then?

338
00:19:57,818 --> 00:19:59,062
<i>No good, huh?</i>

339
00:19:59,286 --> 00:20:02,363
Wait a minute. That means we would
have just given up the initiative.

340
00:20:02,556 --> 00:20:06,868
To get more stakeholders and a good consensus, we
need a partnership where we can make a clear manifesto..

341
00:20:06,893 --> 00:20:09,677
And clear suggestions to all the
parties involved for this to work.

342
00:20:09,702 --> 00:20:11,808
What in the world are you even saying right now?

343
00:20:11,888 --> 00:20:14,536
You know.. I'm actually not too sure myself.

344
00:20:14,709 --> 00:20:15,569
That's true.

345
00:20:16,936 --> 00:20:18,241
<i>He actually understood that?</i>

346
00:20:20,196 --> 00:20:22,349
How about some nearby elementary schools?

347
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:24,933
Maybe we make it like Gamification.

348
00:20:25,399 --> 00:20:28,875
If we can make these kids actually be
productive while having fun like that,

349
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:30,777
we should be able to get some help from them.

350
00:20:32,386 --> 00:20:33,450
It's a win-win.

351
00:20:33,755 --> 00:20:34,595
Win-win...

352
00:20:35,205 --> 00:20:36,513
Yeah! You tell 'em!

353
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:37,169
<i>Tell 'em what?</i>

354
00:20:38,224 --> 00:20:41,965
I think we really should reach out and
negotiate with some of the elementary schools.

355
00:20:42,142 --> 00:20:45,413
It would be fantastic if you could go
ahead and handle that project for us.

356
00:20:45,438 --> 00:20:46,915
Um well, let's see..

357
00:20:48,817 --> 00:20:49,632
How about it?

358
00:20:52,528 --> 00:20:54,239
Sure.. We'd love to do it!

359
00:21:04,366 --> 00:21:04,863
Yo!

360
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,899
So were you in student council
in junior high? I don't remember.

361
00:21:10,172 --> 00:21:11,424
You really fit in there.

362
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:12,761
Not necessarily.

363
00:21:13,842 --> 00:21:15,249
Soooooo...

364
00:21:16,011 --> 00:21:17,282
Break up with your girlfriend?

365
00:21:17,358 --> 00:21:17,787
Huh?

366
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:21,574
I mean, I was just wondering if you're
trying to get with Isshiki over there.

367
00:21:28,143 --> 00:21:30,816
That's not funny. I'm not even interested.

368
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:32,633
Really, that so?

369
00:21:32,747 --> 00:21:35,412
Well, I thought you were going out
with one of them from the other day.

370
00:21:35,464 --> 00:21:36,537
And who is this "them"?

371
00:21:36,562 --> 00:21:38,667
The ones that showed up that day we hung out.

372
00:21:41,031 --> 00:21:42,017
Oh they're just...

373
00:21:42,861 --> 00:21:44,476
We're actually part of the same club.

374
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:46,527
Wait a sec, you're in a club?

375
00:21:46,627 --> 00:21:47,454
Which club?

376
00:21:48,757 --> 00:21:49,691
Service Club.

377
00:21:51,171 --> 00:21:52,464
The Service Club!

378
00:21:52,703 --> 00:21:54,589
What is that even supposed to mean?!

379
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:55,664
That's the funniest thing ever!

380
00:21:55,689 --> 00:21:57,091
No, it's not funny at all.

381
00:21:57,318 --> 00:21:59,561
Seriously, what do you even do?

382
00:22:00,328 --> 00:22:01,098
Really, you've made my day!

383
00:22:01,132 --> 00:22:03,593
<i>Yeah, it's a club that's pretty hard to understand.</i>

384
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,210
<i>But.. That doesn't make it funny.</i>

385
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:10,065
<i>I can't really.. Laugh at it.</i>

386
00:23:41,441 --> 00:23:43,558
Listen we should really prioritize our tasks and

387
00:23:43,583 --> 00:23:46,420
then go back and decide what
is the most important task to do.

388
00:23:46,445 --> 00:23:47,247
Great idea!

389
00:23:47,271 --> 00:23:48,405
Aren't those the same thing?

390
00:23:48,658 --> 00:23:50,539
How many times are you gonna prioritize?

391
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:52,885
Don't you agree with me that the flexible and pliable

392
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:55,410
thinking of the youth is what
is really needed at this moment?

393
00:23:55,485 --> 00:23:56,015
Tell 'em!

394
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:57,400
<i>They both have the same meaning.</i>

395
00:23:57,713 --> 00:23:59,004
How soft are you gonna get?

396
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:03,573
Okay. We've prepared a plan to pool everyone's
resources and dedicate them to the event.

397
00:24:03,827 --> 00:24:06,108
I'm looking forward to the next brainstorming session!

398
00:24:08,191 --> 00:24:09,798
<i>All we've done is prepare.</i>
