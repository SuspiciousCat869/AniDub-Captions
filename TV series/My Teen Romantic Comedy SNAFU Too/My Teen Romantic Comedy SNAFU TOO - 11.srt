1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,360
What are you guys gonna do?

2
00:00:03,773 --> 00:00:05,701
Hina and I are taking liberal arts,

3
00:00:05,733 --> 00:00:07,332
and Yumiko is still thinking about it.

4
00:00:07,357 --> 00:00:10,205
Oh really? Maybe I'll go towards liberal arts, too...

5
00:00:10,376 --> 00:00:11,351
What about you?

6
00:00:11,376 --> 00:00:14,915
I'm pretty sure I've decided I
just need to think on it more.

7
00:00:15,512 --> 00:00:16,237
Oooohh...

8
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:18,630
Hey, Hayato, which path is better?

9
00:00:18,830 --> 00:00:22,757
It's YOUR future, so you better
take it seriously or you may regret it.

10
00:00:23,008 --> 00:00:23,930
That's true.

11
00:00:24,209 --> 00:00:26,003
By the way, Hayato.

12
00:00:26,309 --> 00:00:28,358
Is it true that you're going out with Yukinoshita?

13
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:29,356
What?!

14
00:00:32,692 --> 00:00:34,603
Who thought that was a good thing to say?

15
00:00:36,616 --> 00:00:39,364
Sorry. I just heard a rumor.

16
00:02:11,589 --> 00:02:13,591
Hey, so did you hear about Hayama?

17
00:02:13,755 --> 00:02:16,719
There were some girls that saw
them together during winter break.

18
00:02:16,744 --> 00:02:18,619
Yeah... seems true, right?

19
00:02:21,687 --> 00:02:23,126
Over here, Yukinon!

20
00:02:23,688 --> 00:02:25,248
Why do we have to move...

21
00:02:25,674 --> 00:02:27,418
Happy Birthday!

22
00:02:28,785 --> 00:02:30,553
Th-thank you.

23
00:02:33,207 --> 00:02:37,345
So Yukinoshita, your birthday
is actually on January 3rd, right?

24
00:02:37,707 --> 00:02:40,628
And my birthday is April 16th in case you're wondering.

25
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,838
I didn't ask. By the way, why
are you even in here right now?

26
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:46,162
Oh come on... it's fine, isn't it, guys?

27
00:02:46,270 --> 00:02:49,422
Actually, I've kinda got a
little favor to ask of all of you.

28
00:02:49,839 --> 00:02:50,978
Uh, so um...

29
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:54,986
I heard a little rumor earlier, are
you and Hayama going out, Yukinoshita?

30
00:02:57,404 --> 00:02:58,098
What?

31
00:03:01,621 --> 00:03:02,766
So, Isshiki...

32
00:03:03,165 --> 00:03:04,146
Y-Yes?

33
00:03:04,337 --> 00:03:06,414
You know that there's no way that's true, right?

34
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,132
Oh, right, of course!

35
00:03:08,225 --> 00:03:11,376
I totally knew that rumor was
a big lie, no way it was true!

36
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,454
Must be when we all met up the other day

37
00:03:13,823 --> 00:03:16,207
I guess someone saw that and got the wrong idea.

38
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:19,617
Ah, I see... some low-life with ulterior motives...

39
00:03:19,642 --> 00:03:22,890
But don't they say gossip usually only lasts 49 days?

40
00:03:22,915 --> 00:03:24,494
75 days actually.

41
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,460
Which is fine if that were the case...

42
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,553
It's kind of strange but Hayama hasn't had any
real rumors linking him to anyone up until now.

43
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:34,961
It felt more like he belonged to everyone.

44
00:03:35,254 --> 00:03:37,865
But now it seems like, since this rumor,

45
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:42,205
there are more and more girls coming out of the
woodwork trying to get him, they're always around him.

46
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:43,256
What does that mean?

47
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:45,378
Well, like directly asking him out...

48
00:03:45,571 --> 00:03:49,299
Even if they don't go that far, they still
try to flirt with him in some way or other.

49
00:03:49,429 --> 00:03:51,553
Seriously I don't understand what you even mean?

50
00:03:51,578 --> 00:03:53,320
How do you flirt with someone like that?

51
00:03:56,948 --> 00:03:58,125
Um, hey there...

52
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:01,902
So are you dating anyone special...

53
00:04:03,049 --> 00:04:03,973
at the moment?

54
00:04:08,808 --> 00:04:11,217
Not really... I'm not.

55
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:16,217
You see that? They're all
coming up to Hayama just like that!

56
00:04:16,242 --> 00:04:19,730
But that was because of the way you said it. Right, Hikki?

57
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,151
<i>Well, uh... most guys wouldn't find that unappealing.</i>

58
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,923
<i>I mean, it really struck a chord in me.</i>

59
00:04:28,489 --> 00:04:29,383
Hikki?

60
00:04:29,408 --> 00:04:31,164
Why are you so quiet all of a sudden?

61
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:33,479
Uh... W-Well.. I mean...

62
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:37,762
I get Hayama's situation. Yes, I actually do get it.

63
00:04:41,276 --> 00:04:43,688
Ah! Those look great on you, Yukinon!

64
00:04:43,918 --> 00:04:45,605
Oh, you think so?

65
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:51,763
Yeah... they do.

66
00:04:52,767 --> 00:04:54,102
Thanks, I guess.

67
00:04:54,594 --> 00:04:56,445
Have you always worn glasses?

68
00:04:56,938 --> 00:04:58,512
They're blue-light blocking glasses.

69
00:04:58,537 --> 00:05:02,115
Really? Maybe I should try some
of those, too, what do you think?

70
00:05:02,482 --> 00:05:04,398
You don't even really use computers, do you?

71
00:05:04,423 --> 00:05:06,994
That's not fair I do use them. I use them a lot!

72
00:05:07,019 --> 00:05:08,972
Yukinon, will you let me see them for a minute?

73
00:05:10,742 --> 00:05:12,031
Oh, we got a message.

74
00:05:18,775 --> 00:05:19,972
Do you have minute?

75
00:05:21,887 --> 00:05:23,925
I've got something I wanna talk about...

76
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:26,835
Uh...

77
00:05:29,177 --> 00:05:32,796
Okay, I'm counting on you for the
career plan consultation meeting!

78
00:05:32,948 --> 00:05:34,642
What? I thought you wanted to talk?

79
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,744
See ya later!

80
00:05:38,896 --> 00:05:40,360
What did you want to talk about?

81
00:05:44,742 --> 00:05:47,132
What exactly is going on with you and Hayato?

82
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,438
Actually there's nothing going on at all.

83
00:05:49,926 --> 00:05:52,121
I have just known him for quite a long time.

84
00:05:52,215 --> 00:05:52,897
Really?

85
00:05:53,077 --> 00:05:56,422
Tell me, Miura, is there anything I gain by lying to you?

86
00:05:56,686 --> 00:05:59,475
Seriously... girls like you are always on me.

87
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,956
What? Why are you talking to me with that kind of tone?

88
00:06:03,316 --> 00:06:05,586
Hey. You're really pissing me off. I hate...

89
00:06:05,611 --> 00:06:06,493
Yumiko!

90
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,434
I promise we just ran into him randomly!

91
00:06:09,641 --> 00:06:11,297
I've already explained it to you.

92
00:06:11,598 --> 00:06:13,017
That's ALL it was.

93
00:06:14,665 --> 00:06:16,286
But if it really was only that...

94
00:06:16,311 --> 00:06:18,059
He wouldn't have cared so much.

95
00:06:18,467 --> 00:06:20,071
There's just gotta be more to it.

96
00:06:20,187 --> 00:06:22,053
And I'm not talking about right now...

97
00:06:22,564 --> 00:06:23,961
What about in the past?

98
00:06:26,975 --> 00:06:30,672
Even if there'd been something,
and I told you about it in detail,

99
00:06:31,025 --> 00:06:32,592
what do you think it'd change for you?

100
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:36,755
Would you or anyone else, even believe it?

101
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:40,153
In the end, it's meaningless.

102
00:06:44,125 --> 00:06:45,505
I really hate that-

103
00:06:50,088 --> 00:06:52,185
Is there anything else you'd like to say to me?

104
00:06:56,277 --> 00:06:58,887
Hey, you should try to calm down a bit... kay?

105
00:06:59,527 --> 00:07:01,087
You need to calm down as well.

106
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:02,540
Don't worry I'm calm.

107
00:07:02,813 --> 00:07:05,215
I'm used to it. This always happens.

108
00:07:05,778 --> 00:07:08,446
As long as the people I am close to understand,

109
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,353
then nothing else really matters.

110
00:07:10,657 --> 00:07:14,707
Well, of course. That's exactly why...

111
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:18,293
I want to be close like that to Hayama.

112
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,623
I want to be just like that.

113
00:07:20,954 --> 00:07:22,345
That's why I want to know.

114
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:25,690
What happened between them before,

115
00:07:25,924 --> 00:07:28,389
you're not really interested
in knowing about that, are you?

116
00:07:28,414 --> 00:07:31,718
I just... Well, I... I thought...

117
00:07:32,486 --> 00:07:37,632
I just thought... it would be really nice if we
could be together for just a little bit longer...

118
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:41,683
And... I just don't want it to be like this.

119
00:07:42,517 --> 00:07:46,027
Hayato's... been acting pretty distant lately...

120
00:07:46,504 --> 00:07:48,352
I know that it's kinda weird for me.

121
00:07:48,377 --> 00:07:51,812
I'm just... at a loss and don't know what else to do.

122
00:07:51,837 --> 00:07:52,949
It isn't weird.

123
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,932
Honestly, it isn't weird at all.

124
00:07:55,173 --> 00:07:57,078
Wanting to stay together is normal.

125
00:07:57,377 --> 00:07:59,225
Don't ever feel bad for wanting that.

126
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,514
<i>Miura wants to know Hayato's future plans,</i>

127
00:08:05,601 --> 00:08:09,209
<i>and wants to know what exactly
he plans on doing with his life.</i>

128
00:08:09,309 --> 00:08:14,132
<i>Surely she know that things can't always stay
the way they are or how she wants them to stay.</i>

129
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:17,307
<i>Nevertheless, she wishes to stay by his side.</i>

130
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,045
But you know, Miura,

131
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,376
Have you thought about why he hasn't told you?

132
00:08:22,829 --> 00:08:24,604
Maybe it means he doesn't want you to know.

133
00:08:25,550 --> 00:08:26,964
Maybe he'll hate you for prying.

134
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:28,199
Hey, Hikki enough!

135
00:08:28,224 --> 00:08:29,205
Hikigaya...

136
00:08:29,829 --> 00:08:31,538
With that said, you still wanna know?

137
00:08:31,563 --> 00:08:32,321
I do.

138
00:08:35,316 --> 00:08:39,433
Even with that chance. It's all I've got for now.

139
00:08:40,715 --> 00:08:43,216
I understand. I'll figure something out.

140
00:08:48,667 --> 00:08:49,839
Here, for you.

141
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,210
Oh, thank you.

142
00:08:52,231 --> 00:08:54,025
So, you're using it right away, huh.

143
00:08:57,297 --> 00:08:58,746
It's okay if you guys go home.

144
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:01,210
Hikki.. We can't just leave everything up to you.

145
00:09:01,235 --> 00:09:04,359
It's fine. It's probably easier to ask him alone. So...

146
00:09:04,832 --> 00:09:07,489
Well.. We're sorry to leave it all up to you though.

147
00:09:07,516 --> 00:09:10,070
No worries. That's how the job is sometimes.

148
00:09:11,059 --> 00:09:12,505
That line doesn't suit you.

149
00:09:15,864 --> 00:09:17,181
My career plans?

150
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:19,158
Does someone want to know about that?

151
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:22,034
No, just asking... ya know for reference.

152
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,834
Hmm... Well, can I ask you a favor as well, then?

153
00:09:27,207 --> 00:09:30,318
You can be quite annoying. Can you stop doing that?

154
00:09:32,819 --> 00:09:35,880
Come on, man. What would you do if I said that to you?

155
00:09:35,905 --> 00:09:37,138
It'd be weird, right?

156
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:39,473
I'll think about that type of thing when it happens.

157
00:09:39,683 --> 00:09:40,428
I see...

158
00:09:41,951 --> 00:09:42,794
My answer?

159
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,253
I will leave to your imagination.

160
00:09:49,545 --> 00:09:50,922
Career plans, huh?

161
00:09:50,963 --> 00:09:53,383
I guess since I've worked so hard playing tennis,

162
00:09:53,424 --> 00:09:55,086
I would probably do something that relates.

163
00:09:55,266 --> 00:09:57,325
Couldn't you get recruited or something like that?

164
00:09:58,238 --> 00:10:00,206
That happens only to a lucky few.

165
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,563
There's no one really here to
be recruited except maybe Hayama.

166
00:10:04,074 --> 00:10:05,576
Everyone, break!

167
00:10:05,711 --> 00:10:07,227
{\an8}See you guys after school!

168
00:10:08,854 --> 00:10:09,899
Doesn't suit me, huh?

169
00:10:09,924 --> 00:10:10,969
Oh, no I...

170
00:10:11,687 --> 00:10:14,329
Just surprised to see you be so
leader-like. I haven't seen it...

171
00:10:14,787 --> 00:10:16,144
I didn't expect it I guess.

172
00:10:16,169 --> 00:10:17,921
I'm doing a pretty good job aren't I?

173
00:10:17,946 --> 00:10:20,069
Even if I'm maybe a bit undependable.

174
00:10:21,113 --> 00:10:22,835
No, you're dependable.

175
00:10:23,326 --> 00:10:24,856
I guess I don't really know yet, but...

176
00:10:25,429 --> 00:10:26,383
Uh.. I mean...

177
00:10:27,184 --> 00:10:28,564
You... probably are.

178
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:35,540
Oh! You're late... Come on.

179
00:10:37,665 --> 00:10:40,817
Oh! And thanks so much to the both of you as well!

180
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:42,740
Yahallo, Iroha!

181
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,658
What would you like for us to do?

182
00:10:45,159 --> 00:10:47,652
We really need to get this room rearranged.

183
00:10:48,110 --> 00:10:50,452
And the alumni are coming by as well.

184
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:52,157
The Alumni are coming?

185
00:10:52,517 --> 00:10:54,763
Well, if it isn't Hikigaya!

186
00:10:55,248 --> 00:10:56,477
Yahallo!

187
00:10:58,828 --> 00:11:00,970
Hey, Sis... I have a question for you.

188
00:11:02,886 --> 00:11:06,316
Hayato's career plans? Why such an interest?

189
00:11:06,341 --> 00:11:07,746
Do you know anything about them?

190
00:11:07,771 --> 00:11:10,174
Just when I thought you'd started doing things yourself...

191
00:11:10,374 --> 00:11:13,122
you're asking people for favors just like in the past...

192
00:11:13,229 --> 00:11:16,722
However back then when you were
really little, it was super cute...

193
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:18,844
Just go figure and it out for yourself.

194
00:11:22,209 --> 00:11:23,179
Yukinon...

195
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,048
Will you walk me to the station!

196
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,621
What?

197
00:11:34,129 --> 00:11:39,208
I can imagine it's not often you get to walk
home with such a beautiful young lady such as myself.

198
00:11:40,244 --> 00:11:41,585
Kay! Shall we go?

199
00:11:42,774 --> 00:11:44,019
Ahhh. Whatever...

200
00:11:46,412 --> 00:11:49,203
Did you ask Yukino what major she was going to pursue?

201
00:11:49,666 --> 00:11:51,028
No... I didn't.

202
00:11:51,417 --> 00:11:53,965
Well, I guess she won't say it herself.

203
00:11:54,569 --> 00:11:57,284
But seriously, you'd better ask her, Hikigaya.

204
00:11:57,668 --> 00:11:59,328
We'll check our answers next time.

205
00:11:59,357 --> 00:12:02,402
Technically I don't think we can
really call her response an answer.

206
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,765
Don't worry about the details, silly!

207
00:12:05,966 --> 00:12:08,643
Speaking of... did you ask Hayato directly?

208
00:12:08,824 --> 00:12:10,694
Yeah. He had a lot to say,

209
00:12:10,719 --> 00:12:12,578
but none of it answered the question at all.

210
00:12:12,603 --> 00:12:16,161
Oh, is that so? So Hayato expected it, too?

211
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:16,974
Why's that?

212
00:12:18,409 --> 00:12:21,166
For someone to help find him... maybe?

213
00:12:28,664 --> 00:12:30,553
"Everyone's Hayama Hayato".

214
00:12:31,023 --> 00:12:34,403
I'm not as good of a guy... as you think I am.

215
00:12:43,419 --> 00:12:43,921
Hello?

216
00:12:44,117 --> 00:12:47,608
Hey... it's me. I'm sorry. I know it's little late.

217
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:49,139
It's okay, what's up?

218
00:12:52,548 --> 00:12:53,526
I need a favor.

219
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,105
You've got this, Hayama!

220
00:12:59,130 --> 00:13:01,602
Good luck on going for yet another win this year!

221
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:06,185
H-Hayato... G-Good luck out there!

222
00:13:09,149 --> 00:13:11,361
While I'm at it, good luck to you, too!

223
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:13,425
Thanks!

224
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:15,691
{\an8}No, no.. Not you, Tobe!

225
00:13:16,883 --> 00:13:18,684
Do your best! Okay.

226
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:23,209
I wish you luck.

227
00:13:25,748 --> 00:13:27,775
Alright... let's do this.

228
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,678
On your mark! Get set!

229
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:03,856
<i>I'm so glad I rode my bike to school today.</i>

230
00:14:03,987 --> 00:14:06,289
<i>There's no way I'd be able to do this otherwise.</i>

231
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,819
You're really keeping up with me.

232
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:16,002
Well, yeah. If I don't think about pacing myself,

233
00:14:16,274 --> 00:14:17,549
it's not impossible.

234
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:24,031
<i>I wonder what people think when they get close
to the point of no return on a difficult task?</i>

235
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:26,966
<i>If there's still half left, does it feel hopeless?</i>

236
00:14:27,324 --> 00:14:30,092
<i>Or is there a sense of relief
since they've already come halfway?</i>

237
00:14:30,792 --> 00:14:33,026
<i>I imagine people feel either one way or the other.</i>

238
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,792
<i>And both of those feelings, no matter what,</i>

239
00:14:36,107 --> 00:14:37,774
<i>make a gap in people's hearts.</i>

240
00:14:38,482 --> 00:14:41,175
<i>That's why... I've pushed myself this far.</i>

241
00:14:43,014 --> 00:14:46,044
Was Miura just a convenient
way to try and avoid other girls?

242
00:14:49,253 --> 00:14:51,230
How about it? Did you find her useful?

243
00:14:51,594 --> 00:14:52,950
Will you just shut up?

244
00:14:55,914 --> 00:14:58,354
Which did you choose, humanities or science?

245
00:14:58,602 --> 00:15:00,134
Fine, I'll put it this way.

246
00:15:02,237 --> 00:15:03,549
Pick the sciences.

247
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:06,280
I have no idea what you picked. And I don't really care.

248
00:15:07,957 --> 00:15:10,645
But there's still time to change it, so pick the sciences.

249
00:15:13,376 --> 00:15:16,579
Don't you understand that's going to
be the only way to get what you want?

250
00:15:16,652 --> 00:15:17,521
{\an8}What I want?

251
00:15:17,796 --> 00:15:20,605
Didn't you tell me to quit
doing these annoying things to you?

252
00:15:21,182 --> 00:15:25,618
I get it. All you want is to be freed
from everyone's great expectations of you.

253
00:15:27,912 --> 00:15:30,774
Not many people pick the sciences. Even less girls do,

254
00:15:30,807 --> 00:15:32,935
they all seem like they wanna go the liberal arts route.

255
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,666
You can start to distance yourself
from the things holding you back

256
00:15:35,719 --> 00:15:37,971
if you choose a different path from everyone else.

257
00:15:37,996 --> 00:15:40,758
Besides, if you do decide to take a different path...

258
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:43,096
then people will understand that and move on.

259
00:15:43,565 --> 00:15:46,631
If your group simply moves
on... no one will ever get hurt.

260
00:15:46,656 --> 00:15:49,022
And the best part, you won't have betrayed anyone.

261
00:15:49,932 --> 00:15:53,287
I knew it... we could never have been friends.

262
00:16:03,399 --> 00:16:05,143
I really hate your guts you know that?

263
00:16:05,907 --> 00:16:06,694
Okay.

264
00:16:07,078 --> 00:16:11,197
I feel like I'm inferior to you, and I can't stand that.

265
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,103
I want us to be equals.

266
00:16:14,954 --> 00:16:17,589
That way, I can actually accept losing to you.

267
00:16:18,348 --> 00:16:21,343
Therefore, that's why I'm not going to do as you suggest.

268
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,279
Sorry I've ruined your chances of winning again.

269
00:16:28,485 --> 00:16:31,358
You didn't. I'll win. Cause that's just who I am.

270
00:16:32,048 --> 00:16:35,021
Moreover, I don't want to lose to the likes of you.

271
00:16:45,735 --> 00:16:48,441
<i>Dammit... Aren't you the cool one?</i>

272
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:54,342
<i>Congratulations on your win, Hayama!</i>

273
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:57,661
I just knew going in that you'd win this race, any words?

274
00:17:01,352 --> 00:17:05,183
Thanks to everyone's support today, I was
able to push through and make it to the end.

275
00:17:05,692 --> 00:17:06,736
My thanks to you.

276
00:17:07,531 --> 00:17:08,382
Yumiko...

277
00:17:10,272 --> 00:17:11,108
Iroha...

278
00:17:12,643 --> 00:17:13,834
thanks, everyone.

279
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:23,507
Let's hear a round of applause for Hayama!

280
00:17:24,173 --> 00:17:26,535
No one cares about the losers, right?

281
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,947
Well I'm guessing he wasn't dating Yukinoshita after all.

282
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:32,593
Yeah, looks like there wasn't any truth to the rumors.

283
00:17:38,509 --> 00:17:39,776
Hey, Hikigaya?

284
00:17:39,801 --> 00:17:40,786
What happened to you?

285
00:17:42,744 --> 00:17:45,745
I was taking a break and they
got worried and sent me here.

286
00:17:46,924 --> 00:17:48,700
Oh... did you get hurt?

287
00:17:48,775 --> 00:17:50,000
Yeah... a little.

288
00:17:50,155 --> 00:17:52,872
I wonder why they didn't take
care of that for you over there?

289
00:17:52,897 --> 00:17:55,031
No one was there when I reached the finish line.

290
00:17:55,073 --> 00:17:56,719
So I see you have bad timing.

291
00:17:56,904 --> 00:18:00,134
Or is it your luck that's so bad? Or maybe bad eyes?

292
00:18:00,316 --> 00:18:01,277
I guess it could be...

293
00:18:01,328 --> 00:18:03,811
My personality, my attitude, take your pick.

294
00:18:05,734 --> 00:18:07,865
Looks like you can't keep your hands to yourself.

295
00:18:12,106 --> 00:18:13,362
Go have a seat over there.

296
00:18:13,592 --> 00:18:15,850
No... I can take care of this on my own thank you.

297
00:18:15,875 --> 00:18:16,763
Just sit down.

298
00:18:28,834 --> 00:18:31,154
{\an8}Ow... uh... that really stings.

299
00:18:31,340 --> 00:18:33,298
Of course it does. I'm disinfecting it.

300
00:18:34,298 --> 00:18:36,697
It's only natural that it'd be effective on you.

301
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:40,351
Please... you don't need to talk to
me like I'm some sort of gross germ.

302
00:18:41,184 --> 00:18:43,304
Well did you figure anything out while running?

303
00:18:43,827 --> 00:18:45,090
Hayama say anything?

304
00:18:45,115 --> 00:18:45,721
Yeah.

305
00:18:46,157 --> 00:18:48,655
He's definitely not choosing science... so.

306
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:50,715
That's an odd way to put it.

307
00:18:52,237 --> 00:18:52,941
All done.

308
00:19:12,562 --> 00:19:14,915
Uh... Th-Thanks... for doing this.

309
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:17,540
It's not... a big deal seriously okay?

310
00:19:21,830 --> 00:19:22,345
Hey.

311
00:19:23,103 --> 00:19:26,431
Can I... ask you which major you're thinking about?

312
00:19:26,975 --> 00:19:29,793
That is the first time you've
ever asked me something like that.

313
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:30,821
Uh, really?

314
00:19:35,185 --> 00:19:37,876
For the time being I'm going with liberal arts.

315
00:19:38,879 --> 00:19:43,033
So... which means.. We'll be in it together.

316
00:19:44,209 --> 00:19:46,756
Well, we'll be in the same field, at the very least.

317
00:19:47,509 --> 00:19:49,748
Kay... I'm gonna head back to the classroom.

318
00:19:50,057 --> 00:19:50,657
Kay.

319
00:19:52,783 --> 00:19:54,369
I'll... See you.

320
00:19:57,355 --> 00:19:58,731
Whoa... Oh hey there!

321
00:19:58,756 --> 00:19:59,835
Oh, Hikki...

322
00:20:00,064 --> 00:20:01,107
Hey, Yuigahama.

323
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:04,378
Oh.. Yeah. I seriously just got here.

324
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:08,860
Hey Yukinon, I'm sorry I'm so late. So...

325
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:11,419
Yumiko and everyone are going to celebrate.

326
00:20:11,680 --> 00:20:12,452
Will you come?

327
00:20:16,242 --> 00:20:20,071
I'm sorry. About those weird rumors...
I'm sure they caused you trouble.

328
00:20:20,104 --> 00:20:21,563
I wouldn't say it was that bad.

329
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:26,299
Also... I'm just really grateful that
you were actually looking out for me.

330
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,118
Yukino... you've really changed a bit.

331
00:20:30,426 --> 00:20:31,179
Have I?

332
00:20:31,962 --> 00:20:34,978
It's just... things around here
are a lot different than back then.

333
00:20:45,285 --> 00:20:46,273
Yukinon!

334
00:20:47,982 --> 00:20:50,076
The food came! There's so much chicken!

335
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:51,585
And it's roasted! C'mon!

336
00:20:52,047 --> 00:20:54,164
You know she really has changed over time.

337
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:57,505
Seems she's not chasing after Haruno anymore.

338
00:20:58,346 --> 00:21:00,849
But... maybe that's just it though huh?

339
00:21:00,874 --> 00:21:02,655
Well that's a good thing, isn't it?

340
00:21:03,398 --> 00:21:04,636
You haven't noticed it?

341
00:21:04,748 --> 00:21:05,501
Noticed?

342
00:21:06,697 --> 00:21:09,435
Well... If you don't get it, I guess its no big deal.

343
00:21:10,561 --> 00:21:12,638
Oh, yeah. I forgot to tell you something.

344
00:21:14,508 --> 00:21:16,224
Relationships don't always end...

345
00:21:16,428 --> 00:21:18,431
simply because you go off to college.

346
00:21:18,456 --> 00:21:19,979
No... they're always changing.

347
00:21:20,246 --> 00:21:23,691
That's just you, Hikigaya. I'm not really like you.

348
00:21:23,731 --> 00:21:26,763
Oh yeah, then why didn't you tell
anyone about your decision, then?

349
00:21:27,803 --> 00:21:30,441
When you pick from the only
option that you have to choose from,

350
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:33,493
you can't really call that your own decision, now can you?

351
00:21:37,636 --> 00:21:39,031
I forgot to tell you something.

352
00:21:40,465 --> 00:21:43,212
So I... really hate your guts, too.

353
00:21:46,872 --> 00:21:48,017
Wow, do you really?

354
00:21:48,667 --> 00:21:50,905
That's the first time anyone has said that to me

355
00:21:51,161 --> 00:21:52,427
right to my face.

356
00:21:53,624 --> 00:21:58,034
Even so... I refuse to choose... anything.

357
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:02,108
I truly think that's the best
way to deal with things, you know.

358
00:22:08,224 --> 00:22:09,808
That's just being selfish.

359
00:23:42,106 --> 00:23:44,712
Oh. So Hayato's chosen liberal arts.

360
00:23:45,006 --> 00:23:47,512
Then... maybe I'll go with that, too.

361
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,776
Is it really that simple of a choice?

362
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:52,145
I mean, there's not really anything I want to do.

363
00:23:52,241 --> 00:23:55,661
I can take time off for the exams,
but I can't really do that with this.

364
00:23:55,702 --> 00:23:57,339
I'd hate to be your boyfriend.

365
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:59,920
What? I don't want to hear that from you, Hikio.

366
00:24:00,891 --> 00:24:02,082
It's just, well...

367
00:24:02,229 --> 00:24:04,678
like, even if I include all the annoying things,

368
00:24:04,703 --> 00:24:07,124
I guess it's fine, after all...

369
00:24:07,337 --> 00:24:10,733
Oh... So its fine to have simple reasons...
