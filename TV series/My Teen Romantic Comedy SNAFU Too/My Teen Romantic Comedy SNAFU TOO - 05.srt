1
00:00:09,778 --> 00:00:10,211
Huh?

2
00:00:16,197 --> 00:00:16,770
Komachi!

3
00:00:18,912 --> 00:00:19,609
What?

4
00:00:20,222 --> 00:00:21,009
Uh...

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:24,699
Can I get you coffee?

6
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,256
Yeah.

7
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:29,526
Okay.

8
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:40,687
Here you go.

9
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:45,797
Hold up... Komachi.

10
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:51,737
Can I talk to you?

11
00:00:52,244 --> 00:00:53,959
Okay, I'll listen.

12
00:01:10,294 --> 00:01:12,698
However, don't you have something to say to me?

13
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:13,104
Uh...

14
00:01:14,755 --> 00:01:15,915
Sorry about earlier.

15
00:01:16,173 --> 00:01:17,883
I shouldn't have said what I said to you.

16
00:01:17,925 --> 00:01:19,623
It wasn't just what you said to me.

17
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:22,106
Your attitude and your personality were bad, as well.

18
00:01:22,191 --> 00:01:23,086
Your eyes too.

19
00:01:23,111 --> 00:01:23,899
That's true.

20
00:01:25,030 --> 00:01:27,869
At any rate, I'm sure there's
something else you did that was bad.

21
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:29,295
Also, true.

22
00:01:29,502 --> 00:01:31,088
And you didn't apologize.

23
00:01:31,231 --> 00:01:32,479
Ah, you're right.

24
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:35,460
But since it's you, Big Brother, it's okay.

25
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,244
And since I'm your little sister.

26
00:01:37,691 --> 00:01:38,611
I'll forgive you.

27
00:01:39,461 --> 00:01:43,111
Also... I'm really sorry for my behavior.

28
00:01:44,118 --> 00:01:45,555
What, don't worry about that.

29
00:01:45,739 --> 00:01:47,925
I forgive you. Because I'm your big bro.

30
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:50,760
You really can be quite full of yourself, can't you Bro?

31
00:01:51,247 --> 00:01:52,926
So you gonna tell me what happened?

32
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:54,459
It's a long story.

33
00:01:56,014 --> 00:01:56,978
That's okay.

34
00:03:28,538 --> 00:03:30,874
I swear... that's just like you.

35
00:03:31,498 --> 00:03:35,177
I mean, I do understand where you're
coming from because I'm your sister...

36
00:03:35,437 --> 00:03:38,523
And we've lived together for
basically forever, so I get it.

37
00:03:38,588 --> 00:03:41,695
I can say "wow, you are so dumb" then smile and move on.

38
00:03:42,009 --> 00:03:44,139
While thinking "He can't be helped" and that's it.

39
00:03:44,501 --> 00:03:46,978
Truthfully... I get a bit sad.

40
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:49,504
But it's different for other people.

41
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,719
They don't understand what you're
thinking and it can be hard on them.

42
00:03:53,369 --> 00:03:55,429
You're nice to me and treat me as an equal...

43
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,048
but I think you're only capable of
that because I'm your little sister.

44
00:03:59,648 --> 00:04:01,672
And most likely, if I weren't your sister...

45
00:04:01,805 --> 00:04:04,264
you wouldn't talk to me or even come anywhere near me.

46
00:04:05,199 --> 00:04:06,946
Well, aside from that point,

47
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,027
I'm really lucky to have you as my sister, you know.

48
00:04:10,821 --> 00:04:12,724
I bet I got a lot of points from that line.

49
00:04:12,958 --> 00:04:14,897
Uh! Wow Big Brother that's so...

50
00:04:19,131 --> 00:04:20,877
That's sweet but if you weren't my big brother,

51
00:04:20,902 --> 00:04:24,549
I absolutely wouldn't come near you and
would completely ignore you so there's that.

52
00:04:24,574 --> 00:04:28,306
Maybe so but I do have some good
points, wouldn't you agree Little Sister?

53
00:04:28,364 --> 00:04:30,901
Nope not at all. You're actually really annoying.

54
00:04:31,268 --> 00:04:31,810
Hm...

55
00:04:34,085 --> 00:04:35,438
But you know...

56
00:04:35,878 --> 00:04:40,562
If you are together with someone for 15 long
years, you can't really help but grow attached to them.

57
00:04:40,821 --> 00:04:43,342
Oh, I bet you I got a lot of points from that great line!

58
00:04:43,676 --> 00:04:46,082
Well, 15 years is a long time.

59
00:04:46,599 --> 00:04:48,003
And then another fifteen.

60
00:04:48,148 --> 00:04:52,014
Actually, more time will pass because
we have all the time in the world.

61
00:04:52,039 --> 00:04:53,079
Quit yammering.

62
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:56,201
How many years do you think I've
been listening to you yammer on and on?

63
00:04:56,226 --> 00:04:58,316
And will keep listening for many more to come!

64
00:04:58,997 --> 00:04:59,668
Do you get it?

65
00:05:00,696 --> 00:05:01,717
Y-yeah...

66
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:04,605
It's not only you.

67
00:05:05,073 --> 00:05:06,977
I have a future I need to protect too.

68
00:05:07,401 --> 00:05:10,401
I really like Yukino and Yui a lot, they're super cool.

69
00:05:10,597 --> 00:05:13,476
So if you break up the club, I'm going to be upset.

70
00:05:14,127 --> 00:05:16,195
So please... just for my sake...

71
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,172
and for the sakes of my friends... can't you do something?

72
00:05:20,948 --> 00:05:23,042
Well if it's for you, I guess I'll have to.

73
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,655
Mhm. Doing it for me is a great idea.

74
00:05:25,865 --> 00:05:27,956
But that's just because I'm so selfish...

75
00:05:27,981 --> 00:05:29,231
I really can't help it.

76
00:05:29,256 --> 00:05:30,444
That is so true.

77
00:05:32,658 --> 00:05:33,565
Thanks for the talk.

78
00:05:34,725 --> 00:05:36,064
You're welcome Big Brother.

79
00:05:41,310 --> 00:05:42,326
<i>After all that...</i>

80
00:05:42,711 --> 00:05:44,499
<i>that's the answer Komachi gave me.</i>

81
00:05:45,499 --> 00:05:47,346
<i>I was searching for the reason somewhere...</i>

82
00:05:48,076 --> 00:05:51,286
<i>to protect that place... and the time we all spend there.</i>

83
00:05:52,309 --> 00:05:56,953
<i>To prevent Yukino Yukinoshita and Yui
Yuigahama from becoming student council president,</i>

84
00:05:57,396 --> 00:05:59,304
<i>what can Hachiman Hikigaya do?</i>

85
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:01,974
<i>Well,</i>

86
00:06:02,986 --> 00:06:05,244
<i>I have no idea and that sucks!!</i>

87
00:06:08,407 --> 00:06:10,929
I know, how about getting rid of our uniforms?

88
00:06:10,954 --> 00:06:11,789
That's great!

89
00:06:11,942 --> 00:06:14,724
It would also be good if there were no more bag checks.

90
00:06:14,996 --> 00:06:16,408
Those are really annoying.

91
00:06:16,478 --> 00:06:19,805
They always seem to find the sexy
manga I've borrowed from my friends...

92
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:20,855
That's just you...

93
00:06:21,775 --> 00:06:22,762
I'll write it down.

94
00:06:22,787 --> 00:06:24,256
Please do not write that down.

95
00:06:24,325 --> 00:06:27,384
More important than "no more checking
our bags," I want to eat lunch on the roof.

96
00:06:27,426 --> 00:06:28,860
Oh, that's a great idea!

97
00:06:30,847 --> 00:06:31,363
Ugh!

98
00:06:36,477 --> 00:06:39,183
Oh, so pitiful, Hachiman Hikigaya!

99
00:06:39,709 --> 00:06:41,316
Stop saying dumb things.

100
00:06:42,105 --> 00:06:43,884
This pitifulness is my default.

101
00:06:44,317 --> 00:06:45,251
Something you want?

102
00:06:45,566 --> 00:06:46,819
Foolish question!

103
00:06:46,937 --> 00:06:49,220
I'm always hunkered down here during the lunch hour.

104
00:06:49,487 --> 00:06:53,404
Anyways my eyes came upon your
sadness, so I came to give you attention.

105
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:56,078
What's wrong with you?

106
00:06:56,232 --> 00:06:58,211
Don't worry it's really not all that important.

107
00:06:58,236 --> 00:06:59,464
Wanna talk about it?

108
00:06:59,489 --> 00:07:00,424
No, that's okay.

109
00:07:00,853 --> 00:07:02,680
Nothing anyone else needs to care or worry about.

110
00:07:02,705 --> 00:07:04,272
Don't be an idiot.

111
00:07:04,704 --> 00:07:09,039
Tell me Hachiman, to what extent have you
painfully listened to my drivel over the years?

112
00:07:09,352 --> 00:07:12,332
I'll listen to your idle gossip, since it's you.

113
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:15,950
You know I'll admit I think I'm pretty cool here...

114
00:07:16,107 --> 00:07:17,559
lending a hand to the weak.

115
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:20,029
Only what you said before that last thing was cool.

116
00:07:20,276 --> 00:07:22,147
So... did you steal that line?

117
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:24,214
Nope... they're all my gems.

118
00:07:24,239 --> 00:07:24,994
Idiot.

119
00:07:25,304 --> 00:07:27,771
You know you're not really saying anything cool right now.

120
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:31,206
Zaimokuza, I have a favor to ask.

121
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:33,302
Uh... um..

122
00:07:33,327 --> 00:07:36,133
So, now as for how we can go about doing this...

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,637
Oh! There you are.

124
00:07:38,226 --> 00:07:38,890
Whoa!

125
00:07:39,206 --> 00:07:40,980
Hey, what are you doing here?

126
00:07:41,005 --> 00:07:43,538
Since you're out here working really hard for me Bro...

127
00:07:43,578 --> 00:07:45,599
I thought I should be doing the same for you!

128
00:07:45,895 --> 00:07:46,932
Ta-da!

129
00:07:46,957 --> 00:07:49,240
I found people who'll gladly work with you Bro!

130
00:07:49,265 --> 00:07:51,131
I can't believe I'm helping out.

131
00:07:51,156 --> 00:07:52,691
And do it with a smile.

132
00:07:52,921 --> 00:07:56,018
Let's start the "Campaign to Retain Yukino and Yui"!

133
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,267
Oh yeah!

134
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:00,153
Not that I really care...

135
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:04,598
But if Yukinoshita and Yuigahama don't end up
running, who's going to be president in the end?

136
00:08:04,845 --> 00:08:05,206
Uh...

137
00:08:05,238 --> 00:08:06,620
Come on now...

138
00:08:07,508 --> 00:08:11,571
Um... tell me why we have to prevent
those two from being elected again?

139
00:08:11,672 --> 00:08:16,115
Really... I'm thinking going to war with
those two could be a very big mistake on our part.

140
00:08:16,345 --> 00:08:18,100
Yes, that is very true but...

141
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:22,695
Big Brother I wanna keep the service club
operating and I must have Yukino and Yui in it.

142
00:08:23,022 --> 00:08:25,843
Honestly I don't care about the student council elections.

143
00:08:25,868 --> 00:08:27,016
Okay?

144
00:08:27,723 --> 00:08:29,311
Then what do I do about Isshiki?

145
00:08:29,784 --> 00:08:33,107
Well whoever this Isshiki person
may be, is she important to you?

146
00:08:33,216 --> 00:08:34,287
No, not at all.

147
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,926
Then, why are you worried about it?

148
00:08:36,006 --> 00:08:38,433
Because a request is still a request Komachi.

149
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:40,684
So, what's more important to you, your job or me?

150
00:08:40,726 --> 00:08:42,465
That's dumb, you, of course.

151
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,818
I've no desire to work.

152
00:08:43,902 --> 00:08:45,546
Process of elimination.

153
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:47,665
Well I guess I don't have to be happy about it...

154
00:08:48,117 --> 00:08:49,073
But, okay.

155
00:08:49,353 --> 00:08:51,033
So what are you going to do about it?

156
00:08:52,927 --> 00:08:53,939
<i>Let's see.</i>

157
00:08:55,694 --> 00:08:59,198
<i>The thing I should give the utmost
priority to is Komachi's request:</i>

158
00:08:59,223 --> 00:09:01,699
<i>Keeping Yukinoshita and Yuigahama in the club.</i>

159
00:09:02,536 --> 00:09:05,367
<i>Supporting the other candidates
is a difficult situation...</i>

160
00:09:05,631 --> 00:09:07,537
<i>so the card left to me is...</i>

161
00:09:10,092 --> 00:09:12,182
I can go try negotiating with Isshiki.

162
00:09:13,161 --> 00:09:15,135
Not gonna happen, she's a girl.

163
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:16,176
Will she even understand you?

164
00:09:16,201 --> 00:09:19,513
If Iroha Isshiki is playing that particular character...

165
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:22,552
I'm going to say I'll have an easy negotiation.

166
00:09:23,258 --> 00:09:26,778
In the end... Isshiki just
wants to protect her brand image.

167
00:09:27,332 --> 00:09:28,324
So because of that...

168
00:09:28,566 --> 00:09:32,850
she wants to avoid the high risk-low
return issue of a vote of no confidence.

169
00:09:32,914 --> 00:09:33,815
Which means...

170
00:09:34,849 --> 00:09:36,668
My first approach was a mistake.

171
00:09:38,472 --> 00:09:39,242
Kawasaki.

172
00:09:39,378 --> 00:09:39,992
Hm?

173
00:09:40,162 --> 00:09:42,519
Who do you think would be a
good student council president?

174
00:09:42,926 --> 00:09:44,506
Can you come up with a list of names?

175
00:09:44,615 --> 00:09:45,162
Huh?

176
00:09:47,311 --> 00:09:49,573
I'm thinking you too, I guess?

177
00:09:49,686 --> 00:09:50,133
Huh?

178
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:53,203
Ha, that's really funny.

179
00:09:53,269 --> 00:09:56,218
There's no way I'd be able to
get nominations from 30 people.

180
00:09:56,635 --> 00:09:58,817
I know that. I just wanted to say it.

181
00:09:59,144 --> 00:10:00,014
Big Bro...

182
00:10:00,549 --> 00:10:02,962
Talk to Yukino and Yui about this, okay?

183
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:04,462
Promise me?

184
00:10:04,732 --> 00:10:08,481
Yeah, but when I go present the idea
to them, I need to sound persuasive.

185
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:10,234
So first I need to prepare.

186
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:14,652
I'm worried that bad things will happen since
you're the type to argue for the sake of arguing.

187
00:10:14,887 --> 00:10:16,047
It'll be okay.

188
00:10:17,034 --> 00:10:20,511
<i>I've now got a reason, a
problem, and a solution established.</i>

189
00:10:21,574 --> 00:10:23,554
<i>I just need to put it into action.</i>

190
00:10:32,854 --> 00:10:36,167
Oh, I would like you to put LCD tablets in the art room.

191
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,634
LCD tablets?

192
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:49,121
<i>One-third of the whole student body, huh?</i>

193
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:53,158
It is I.

194
00:10:53,196 --> 00:10:56,377
We've got enough numbers... I'm
going to move on to the next step now.

195
00:10:56,530 --> 00:10:59,832
Uh... This is not really a good tactic.

196
00:10:59,857 --> 00:11:01,491
This is fraught with danger.

197
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,605
Zaimokuza...

198
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,302
Oh, don't misunderstand me.

199
00:11:04,327 --> 00:11:06,079
It is not you I'm worried about!

200
00:11:06,104 --> 00:11:08,849
You see, I also assume responsibility by assisting,

201
00:11:08,874 --> 00:11:11,743
and the anxiety that you will
blame me for everything is terrible.

202
00:11:11,768 --> 00:11:14,865
And believe me in that instance, I am
prepared to tell everyone everything!

203
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:17,856
You really are such trash Zaimokuza. Never change.

204
00:11:18,273 --> 00:11:19,174
It's okay though.

205
00:11:19,573 --> 00:11:20,840
They can search all they want.

206
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:23,321
The person behind these accounts doesn't exist.

207
00:11:23,809 --> 00:11:24,985
No one's going to get hurt.

208
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:27,130
Just keep this in mind...

209
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:31,649
As long as you don't go and make a
problem a problem, it won't be seen as one.

210
00:11:33,214 --> 00:11:34,449
Can you get Isshiki for me?

211
00:11:37,039 --> 00:11:37,465
Ah!

212
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:38,958
Oh...

213
00:11:39,157 --> 00:11:41,017
<i>Sorry, it's only me.</i>

214
00:11:41,881 --> 00:11:45,072
Copying down all of this stuff
is really difficult you know!

215
00:11:47,437 --> 00:11:52,450
Oh, so by the way, was the girl you were
hanging out with the other day Hayama's girlfriend?

216
00:11:52,475 --> 00:11:53,423
I have no idea.

217
00:11:53,474 --> 00:11:56,838
Come on, surely it's okay if you tell me... isn't it?

218
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:57,950
When this is over.

219
00:12:00,065 --> 00:12:03,431
Whatever I don't really think that
will be much of a problem for me.

220
00:12:03,456 --> 00:12:04,698
Don't you think so too?

221
00:12:04,844 --> 00:12:08,112
So anyway... speaking of him do you like...

222
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,083
what do you think about him?

223
00:12:12,136 --> 00:12:12,515
Huh?

224
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,159
Are you trying to hit on me right now?

225
00:12:14,184 --> 00:12:16,605
Sorry, it can't happen, I have a crush on someone else.

226
00:12:16,630 --> 00:12:17,636
No, that's not it.

227
00:12:18,047 --> 00:12:20,662
I was just simply asking you
what you thought about Hayama.

228
00:12:20,687 --> 00:12:21,075
Oh...

229
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,025
Hm... let me think about it for a second.

230
00:12:24,063 --> 00:12:26,864
At first I thought he was so cute, and I wanted to ki...

231
00:12:27,431 --> 00:12:30,109
I wanted to hold hands with him, or something but...

232
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,525
<i>You just almost said you wanted to "kiss" him?</i>

233
00:12:32,668 --> 00:12:33,644
So anyways...

234
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:36,397
Is there really a point in doing all of this?

235
00:12:36,941 --> 00:12:38,438
It's not like there isn't one.

236
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,360
You know the way you said that just now was kinda vague...

237
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:45,563
There's no way to win against Yukinoshita
or Yuigahama... no matter what you do.

238
00:12:47,073 --> 00:12:49,127
It's pointless in that way.

239
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:54,656
Well, not that I would really want to...

240
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:59,141
but I think it would be super
scary if I actually won the election.

241
00:12:59,450 --> 00:13:01,356
It's not like you're gonna really win this.

242
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:04,244
Yeah... well...

243
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,125
Besides, whoever those people who nominated you
were, they won't really vote for you, will they?

244
00:13:11,429 --> 00:13:13,700
Those people are probably laughing hard right now.

245
00:13:14,015 --> 00:13:16,867
And, when they see you lose the
election, they'll laugh even more about it.

246
00:13:19,456 --> 00:13:21,252
That would make you mad, wouldn't it?

247
00:13:22,336 --> 00:13:25,933
However... wouldn't you want to give
them a taste of their own medicine?

248
00:13:27,342 --> 00:13:29,468
I do... well... I could do it I know I can...

249
00:13:29,493 --> 00:13:30,255
You can.

250
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,327
You've been writing for quite a while now.

251
00:13:34,529 --> 00:13:35,646
Do you know what that is?

252
00:13:35,671 --> 00:13:37,592
It's the list of nominators, right?

253
00:13:37,711 --> 00:13:39,225
That's right. However...

254
00:13:39,691 --> 00:13:42,168
This here is the list of people that nominated you.

255
00:13:42,292 --> 00:13:42,822
Uh...

256
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:45,188
Huh?

257
00:13:45,894 --> 00:13:49,819
But I already have enough, how can I possible
have more than the amount required to run?

258
00:13:49,851 --> 00:13:52,403
The rule says that there must be
at least thirty people to run...

259
00:13:52,916 --> 00:13:54,456
but it's okay if you gather more.

260
00:13:55,313 --> 00:13:58,106
Someone is running an Isshiki support account, online.

261
00:13:58,901 --> 00:14:01,288
If just one-third of the student body supports you...

262
00:14:01,336 --> 00:14:03,245
then you can easily go and win this election.

263
00:14:03,875 --> 00:14:06,342
I don't get where this came from? That's not possible.

264
00:14:06,688 --> 00:14:09,685
And even if I were to win this
thing, I wouldn't be a good president.

265
00:14:10,314 --> 00:14:12,318
I don't have confidence in myself.

266
00:14:12,527 --> 00:14:14,383
Plus I already belong to a club.

267
00:14:14,623 --> 00:14:16,890
I agree it would be difficult to deal with both.

268
00:14:16,924 --> 00:14:18,738
But what you would gain would be huge.

269
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,251
What do you think it is?

270
00:14:20,457 --> 00:14:21,108
What?

271
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:24,007
Well, experience or something like that.

272
00:14:24,393 --> 00:14:26,080
And maybe a good recommendation.

273
00:14:26,438 --> 00:14:29,448
So for the record here... you're acting like a teacher.

274
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:30,175
That's wrong.

275
00:14:30,624 --> 00:14:32,605
The thing you gain is the chance to say...

276
00:14:33,299 --> 00:14:37,748
"Even though I'm a freshman and student council
president, I'm doing my best and showing up to practice!"

277
00:14:38,021 --> 00:14:38,554
See?

278
00:14:38,881 --> 00:14:39,674
Ew.

279
00:14:41,292 --> 00:14:43,844
And when you're a freshman,
and you mess up, you're forgiven.

280
00:14:44,066 --> 00:14:47,494
You also have the excuse of going to
practice when student council gets annoying.

281
00:14:47,991 --> 00:14:49,425
And the opposite is also true.

282
00:14:49,603 --> 00:14:52,517
Yea, but it's still gonna be really difficult for me.

283
00:14:52,542 --> 00:14:53,335
What do I do?

284
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,667
When those times happen, you can consult Hayama.

285
00:14:56,137 --> 00:14:56,578
Huh?

286
00:14:56,864 --> 00:14:58,217
It's okay to accept his help.

287
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:02,699
Hey, maybe you can make him keep an eye out for
you and walk you home after practice sometimes.

288
00:15:07,149 --> 00:15:10,093
No way, how are you actually even this smart?

289
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:11,032
I just am.

290
00:15:12,213 --> 00:15:12,676
Hm...

291
00:15:13,828 --> 00:15:17,130
If this many people are supporting
me, I guess I can't say no.

292
00:15:17,595 --> 00:15:20,908
You know I've gotta say... your
suggestion is quite attractive.

293
00:15:21,413 --> 00:15:22,359
Let me tell you...

294
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:25,465
it really hurts me being laughed
at by the kids in my class.

295
00:15:27,862 --> 00:15:30,037
Okay, I'll work with you. Let's win this!

296
00:15:35,323 --> 00:15:36,553
Have you changed your minds yet?

297
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:39,808
No I haven't. This is the best strategy.

298
00:15:40,231 --> 00:15:41,791
Mine hasn't changed, either.

299
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:43,968
It's not necessary for you to run, too.

300
00:15:44,084 --> 00:15:46,217
It is. And I don't wanna lose.

301
00:15:46,581 --> 00:15:48,227
Actually why are you running?

302
00:15:48,336 --> 00:15:51,465
Because, if you aren't here Yukinon, the club will end.

303
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:53,211
I don't want that to happen.

304
00:15:53,638 --> 00:15:55,184
It's not going to come to that.

305
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:56,170
It will!

306
00:15:56,489 --> 00:15:59,032
The truth is, you don't have to run in the election.

307
00:15:59,474 --> 00:16:02,014
Not just you, Yuigahama, you too, Yukinoshita.

308
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:04,049
What are you even talking about?

309
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,603
I'm pretty sure we rejected your crazy plan.

310
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,338
You did, but it's not that plan.

311
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:08,904
Huh?

312
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,335
I already gave up on that.

313
00:16:14,029 --> 00:16:15,918
Did you have something to do with this?

314
00:16:16,145 --> 00:16:17,407
An interested party...

315
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:19,284
I don't really know who it was though.

316
00:16:19,827 --> 00:16:20,640
I see.

317
00:16:20,665 --> 00:16:22,301
An amazing number of people.

318
00:16:22,326 --> 00:16:25,522
Yeah, it's about about one-third of
the student body of the high school.

319
00:16:25,849 --> 00:16:27,542
<i>This number is the actual truth.</i>

320
00:16:28,169 --> 00:16:31,970
<i>Although, it was impossible to
gather this much support for Isshiki...</i>

321
00:16:32,562 --> 00:16:35,522
<i>In other words, there's just one big lie in the moon.</i>

322
00:16:36,275 --> 00:16:37,243
I got it, okay?

323
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:38,389
Later man.

324
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:38,850
Out!

325
00:16:41,356 --> 00:16:42,769
<i>This is nothing but junk.</i>

326
00:16:43,598 --> 00:16:45,511
<i>It was just a tool used to persuade them.</i>

327
00:16:46,157 --> 00:16:48,867
<i>So... I just need to get through this day,</i>

328
00:16:49,501 --> 00:16:51,314
<i>and then get rid of the support accounts.</i>

329
00:16:51,693 --> 00:16:52,921
<i>Erase all of it.</i>

330
00:16:54,088 --> 00:16:55,766
In order for Isshiki to be president...

331
00:16:56,212 --> 00:16:58,916
I cleared all the requirements
and the shackles holding her down.

332
00:16:58,996 --> 00:17:03,177
So, there's no need for you to run
for student council president anymore.

333
00:17:08,063 --> 00:17:09,679
So a support account, huh?

334
00:17:23,504 --> 00:17:24,348
Well I'm glad.

335
00:17:26,447 --> 00:17:27,644
So, this is settled, right?

336
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:36,395
So... I see...

337
00:17:36,675 --> 00:17:39,972
You're telling us there's no
reason we need to act anymore.

338
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,265
Yeah, I guess you don't, huh.

339
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:43,481
Yes.

340
00:17:46,772 --> 00:17:49,378
I really thought you of all people would understand.

341
00:17:49,558 --> 00:17:50,015
Uh?

342
00:17:51,398 --> 00:17:51,910
Huh?

343
00:17:52,191 --> 00:17:53,855
I guess I'll go tell the teachers.

344
00:17:54,389 --> 00:17:55,960
Uh! We'll come.

345
00:17:56,196 --> 00:17:57,600
Just one of us is enough.

346
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:15,416
Um... Sorry about that.

347
00:18:15,665 --> 00:18:17,596
Huh? Why are you apologizing?

348
00:18:18,008 --> 00:18:20,360
Well, you really worked on this didn't you?

349
00:18:20,920 --> 00:18:23,752
Like, your public pledge, and the speech, and stuff.

350
00:18:24,011 --> 00:18:26,180
Oh that... that doesn't really matter.

351
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,455
I bet you did a lot too, didn't you, Hikki?

352
00:18:28,609 --> 00:18:31,299
Oh wow, your hair has grown all long and straggly.

353
00:18:31,324 --> 00:18:32,436
Here, let me fix it.

354
00:18:33,189 --> 00:18:34,576
It doesn't need fixing.

355
00:18:34,891 --> 00:18:35,709
There, there.

356
00:18:40,612 --> 00:18:42,440
I bet you did your best too, huh?

357
00:18:42,972 --> 00:18:43,943
Not really...

358
00:18:51,828 --> 00:18:53,419
This place is important to me.

359
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:56,588
And you somehow protected it.

360
00:18:59,557 --> 00:19:00,045
Hey...

361
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:04,685
I knew that I probably wouldn't
beat Yukinon for the presidency,

362
00:19:05,275 --> 00:19:09,983
but then I also worried that if I did win, then I
wouldn't be able to come to the club activities anymore.

363
00:19:11,132 --> 00:19:13,931
And I have you to thank for all of this.

364
00:19:14,151 --> 00:19:15,255
You're wrong about that.

365
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:18,665
That's enough.

366
00:19:30,675 --> 00:19:32,045
You did your best, Hikki!

367
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,158
What are you saying?

368
00:19:34,674 --> 00:19:36,135
Hikki did his best, huh?

369
00:19:36,181 --> 00:19:38,215
Stop... I didn't really do anything.

370
00:19:38,982 --> 00:19:39,897
That's true.

371
00:19:40,130 --> 00:19:42,185
I mean nothing we can actually see, right?

372
00:19:42,411 --> 00:19:43,917
But then again I know you...

373
00:19:44,494 --> 00:19:46,579
I bet you did something you didn't want to do.

374
00:19:47,305 --> 00:19:49,100
Maybe you wanted to change your ways...

375
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,744
however it's not something you can easily do.

376
00:19:53,028 --> 00:19:54,975
And your guilty conscious lingers.

377
00:19:56,698 --> 00:19:58,371
I couldn't really do anything,

378
00:19:58,689 --> 00:20:01,395
but even so I wondered if this was the right thing to do.

379
00:20:02,052 --> 00:20:04,669
So, it will probably bother you more, Hikki.

380
00:20:06,124 --> 00:20:08,197
Now we can go back to how it was before.

381
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:09,953
I don't know about that.

382
00:20:12,501 --> 00:20:15,010
I really thought you of all people would understand.

383
00:20:18,458 --> 00:20:21,246
This club is not really that difficult to deal with,

384
00:20:21,271 --> 00:20:22,923
and I understand how the
student council activities work...

385
00:20:22,955 --> 00:20:24,497
<i>There are people that can't act...</i>

386
00:20:25,472 --> 00:20:26,960
<i>if they are not given a problem...</i>

387
00:20:27,718 --> 00:20:29,126
<i>and they can't find a reason.</i>

388
00:20:31,286 --> 00:20:33,181
<i>The only thing that remained for me...</i>

389
00:20:33,982 --> 00:20:37,237
<i>was the suspicion, I had made a big mistake.</i>

390
00:20:37,979 --> 00:20:39,126
Do you start working today?

391
00:20:39,583 --> 00:20:40,410
I sure do!

392
00:20:41,084 --> 00:20:44,430
You know, I kinda don't think it'll
go so well in the beginning, though.

393
00:20:44,883 --> 00:20:47,589
Next year my little sister will enter this school.

394
00:20:47,674 --> 00:20:48,221
Oh?

395
00:20:48,756 --> 00:20:50,961
Listen, you better try and do a good job.

396
00:20:52,848 --> 00:20:53,360
Ah!

397
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:57,979
What? Are you trying to hit on me? You are
being too obvious! It's uncomfortable! Sorry!

398
00:20:58,230 --> 00:21:00,887
<i>Seems you had a different reason for rejecting me before.</i>

399
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:02,215
Good luck to you then...

400
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,580
Oh, Hikigaya.

401
00:21:07,346 --> 00:21:08,253
I can grab that.

402
00:21:08,825 --> 00:21:10,846
Thanks! I had more things than I thought.

403
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:11,633
Ugh!

404
00:21:16,998 --> 00:21:19,057
Seems like it's a different room, huh?

405
00:21:21,894 --> 00:21:24,529
Man, I was really gunning for her too.

406
00:21:24,647 --> 00:21:25,079
What?

407
00:21:25,332 --> 00:21:28,419
I had thought Yukinoshita would
become the student council president.

408
00:21:28,846 --> 00:21:31,336
And then Yuigahama would become the vice president.

409
00:21:31,541 --> 00:21:32,928
And you'd be general affairs!

410
00:21:32,953 --> 00:21:35,162
You gave me a minor position? Wow.

411
00:21:35,254 --> 00:21:38,056
And, when I've graduated, I would sometimes come back...

412
00:21:38,081 --> 00:21:40,156
just to hang with you guys during meetings...

413
00:21:40,181 --> 00:21:41,829
And then I'd get to say things like,

414
00:21:41,854 --> 00:21:44,954
"The cultural festival and the
sports festival were so much fun!"

415
00:21:45,087 --> 00:21:46,520
And you guys did that!

416
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:50,546
You know... I've always dreamt of that.

417
00:21:53,469 --> 00:21:55,329
<i>I've been thinking about consequences.</i>

418
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:58,799
<i>What if... And this is purely hypothetical...</i>

419
00:21:59,609 --> 00:22:02,884
<i>What if we could go back to the last
save point and make a different choice?</i>

420
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:04,675
<i>What do you think would've happened?</i>

421
00:22:05,339 --> 00:22:06,610
<i>Would things have been different?</i>

422
00:22:08,117 --> 00:22:10,064
<i>The answer is no.</i>

423
00:23:41,879 --> 00:23:45,373
Okay, surely that's everything by now, right, Iroha?

424
00:23:45,398 --> 00:23:48,844
Tobe, the refrigerator needs to
move, it's supposed to go in the corner.

425
00:23:48,869 --> 00:23:50,629
And the heater goes next to the desk.

426
00:23:50,654 --> 00:23:53,102
Aww... You should've told me that before.

427
00:23:53,175 --> 00:23:56,115
Hey, Iroha, I've gotta head
out to my seasonal Christmas job!

428
00:23:56,140 --> 00:24:00,509
But I'm bored now, and I want to finish remodeling
the student council room as soon as possible.

429
00:24:00,534 --> 00:24:01,849
O-okay.

430
00:24:01,981 --> 00:24:03,274
But I need to get to work.

431
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,410
I wish Hayato would hurry up and get here!

432
00:24:05,435 --> 00:24:06,523
Uh. Hayama?

433
00:24:06,548 --> 00:24:08,973
Okay, Tobe! You can go ahead and leave right now.

434
00:24:09,412 --> 00:24:10,580
O-okay.
