1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:04,320
I did a mean thing to Iroha huh?

2
00:00:04,847 --> 00:00:07,841
If you were going to feel this
guilty, you shouldn't have rejected her.

3
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:11,067
I had to. Why would you even say that when you know why?

4
00:00:11,177 --> 00:00:12,773
That's a dick move on your part.

5
00:00:12,968 --> 00:00:13,806
Yeah, well...

6
00:00:15,447 --> 00:00:17,516
I'm flattered she feels that way about me.

7
00:00:18,293 --> 00:00:19,140
But she's wrong.

8
00:00:20,088 --> 00:00:22,102
I don't think... I'm right for her.

9
00:00:23,711 --> 00:00:24,556
You're amazing.

10
00:00:25,387 --> 00:00:27,860
You change the people around you so easily.

11
00:00:28,171 --> 00:00:30,030
What? That's out of the blue.

12
00:00:30,683 --> 00:00:33,011
It's really not. I told you...

13
00:00:33,509 --> 00:00:36,146
I'm not as nice of a guy as you might think I am.

14
00:00:39,347 --> 00:00:42,693
{\an8}I've complimented you for my own sake.

15
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,723
<i>We will be arriving Kaihin Makuhari.</i>

16
00:00:48,748 --> 00:00:50,960
Oh, great... our stop is up here next.

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,571
'key.

18
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:55,832
Isshiki... My stop is next, too. Where do you get off?

19
00:00:58,069 --> 00:01:00,941
Um.. My bags are really heavy...

20
00:01:03,008 --> 00:01:05,489
Yeah. That's seems like a good idea.

21
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,129
You know... that really sucked.

22
00:01:13,384 --> 00:01:17,393
Yeah. But honestly you knew it was
going to be a bad idea in the first place.

23
00:01:18,225 --> 00:01:22,527
I couldn't help it. Everything was so
exciting, and I just got caught up in it all.

24
00:01:22,552 --> 00:01:23,424
It surprised me.

25
00:01:23,448 --> 00:01:24,944
I mean honestly, I didn't really think

26
00:01:24,969 --> 00:01:28,258
you were the type to get so emotionally
caught up in that sort of environment.

27
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:32,824
I surprised myself, too. You know I
really thought I'd be a lot cooler about it.

28
00:01:32,947 --> 00:01:37,128
Yeah. You really seem to have nothing but love
on the brain, but I know you can be pretty clever.

29
00:01:37,153 --> 00:01:39,722
This isn't about me... I'm talking about you.

30
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:40,185
{\an8}What?

31
00:01:40,856 --> 00:01:44,028
Anyone's heart would start to beat
faster after that kind of display.

32
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:44,848
Display?

33
00:01:45,566 --> 00:01:48,663
I realized... I wanted something genuine as well.

34
00:01:50,297 --> 00:01:51,563
So, you heard that?

35
00:01:51,875 --> 00:01:54,126
Your voice just kinda spilled out of the room.

36
00:01:54,379 --> 00:01:55,530
Forget about it.

37
00:01:55,596 --> 00:01:56,948
I won't ever forget it.

38
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,175
I'm unable to forget it...

39
00:01:59,429 --> 00:02:01,999
and that's why I thought today
was the day I should tell him.

40
00:02:02,292 --> 00:02:05,620
Well.. Listen... Don't worry about it.

41
00:02:06,006 --> 00:02:07,873
You didn't actually do anything wrong.

42
00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:10,855
Are you taking advantage of my
sad heart and trying to woo me?

43
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,203
Sorry but it's still impossible.

44
00:02:12,228 --> 00:02:13,065
That's not it...

45
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:18,728
I mean all is not really lost just yet... actually,
this is a rather effective method of attack for Hayama.

46
00:02:19,043 --> 00:02:20,816
Everyone will sympathize with me...

47
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:23,190
and then hold back to spare my hurt feelings, right?

48
00:02:23,735 --> 00:02:24,390
Y-Yeah.

49
00:02:24,551 --> 00:02:25,839
There's more to my logic.

50
00:02:26,183 --> 00:02:28,749
You worry about the person that you rejected, right?

51
00:02:28,877 --> 00:02:30,500
Like... you'd feel sorry for them.

52
00:02:31,937 --> 00:02:34,376
This defeat has just laid the groundwork...

53
00:02:36,083 --> 00:02:38,386
now I'll try to progress to the next stage.

54
00:02:39,402 --> 00:02:43,683
So then... I... have to keep doing my best.

55
00:02:47,193 --> 00:02:49,174
Listen... you're great.

56
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:52,840
It's your fault though. I'm like this because of you.

57
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:56,565
Well... it's true I made you
president, but other than that...

58
00:02:57,064 --> 00:02:59,764
Please... take responsibility.

59
00:04:35,212 --> 00:04:38,378
So um... why did you want to gather us all here together?

60
00:04:38,863 --> 00:04:42,242
{\an8}To confirm our objective and
solidify our plan before we go.

61
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:43,179
Okay...

62
00:04:43,364 --> 00:04:45,474
The current plan is completely impossible.

63
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:48,018
We can only finish part of everything, at best.

64
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:51,448
It's going to be a pretty pitiful
event compared to how we advertised it.

65
00:04:51,597 --> 00:04:53,829
What do you think we should do in order to prevent that?

66
00:04:54,686 --> 00:04:56,917
Uh... I don't really know.

67
00:04:56,942 --> 00:04:58,592
{\an8}There's a problem with the meetings.

68
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:02,869
They integrate all our ideas... but
no one is really making any decisions.

69
00:05:03,288 --> 00:05:07,008
So let's completely get rid of these
indecisions, and have a proper meeting.

70
00:05:07,714 --> 00:05:11,855
We'll have objections, rejections,
but also clear answers to each idea.

71
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,697
Can we have that meeting?

72
00:05:14,568 --> 00:05:16,904
Well then... what do you think about that?

73
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:20,528
I think... it's better not to disturb what we have.

74
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:24,707
Trying to raise a counter-proposal like
that now is going to be tough to pull off.

75
00:05:24,732 --> 00:05:26,247
You're right, that's true...

76
00:05:26,682 --> 00:05:27,979
Let's do it anyways.

77
00:05:30,274 --> 00:05:34,986
Personally, speaking... I don't wanna go
out there and put on a pitiful event, okay?

78
00:05:36,677 --> 00:05:37,667
Maybe so...

79
00:05:38,027 --> 00:05:42,086
in my opinion, I was actually thinking a
play would be a much better idea for this.

80
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:45,084
Imagine if we could have both music and a play.

81
00:05:45,109 --> 00:05:48,109
That would really be a great
deal for all the guests that attend.

82
00:05:48,134 --> 00:05:49,663
I'm not sure about separating.

83
00:05:49,787 --> 00:05:52,616
The synergistic effect will fade,
and doesn't that double the risk?

84
00:05:52,641 --> 00:05:55,343
That may be. But we need to look at the event budget-wise.

85
00:05:55,368 --> 00:05:57,164
We really should think about this as a group,

86
00:05:57,331 --> 00:05:58,945
{\an8}since this is what the meeting is for.

87
00:05:58,981 --> 00:05:59,885
I agree with that.

88
00:06:00,792 --> 00:06:01,926
Agreed! Agreed!

89
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:02,571
Tell 'em!

90
00:06:02,644 --> 00:06:04,323
Um, may I ask something?

91
00:06:05,086 --> 00:06:07,805
Why are you against having two
different parts to the event?

92
00:06:08,136 --> 00:06:09,789
{\an8}Well, I'm not really against it...

93
00:06:10,465 --> 00:06:14,099
If we can join our visions, I think
we can have a stronger sense of unity.

94
00:06:14,124 --> 00:06:18,076
The framework of a joint event is a must,
even if we're just using it to build our image.

95
00:06:18,101 --> 00:06:20,037
Is a joint event even necessary?

96
00:06:20,395 --> 00:06:23,882
Yes. Don't you see that jointly,
synergy will arise out of a large event...

97
00:06:23,908 --> 00:06:28,330
There's no synergy here, and if things stay
like this, we won't make it much of an event.

98
00:06:28,429 --> 00:06:31,218
So tell me. Why are you trying to stick with this method?

99
00:06:31,636 --> 00:06:33,442
Because we took a consensus.

100
00:06:33,506 --> 00:06:35,926
And then we even shared the grand design of it all.

101
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:36,863
We agree!

102
00:06:36,888 --> 00:06:37,644
{\an8}Tell em!

103
00:06:38,551 --> 00:06:39,369
You're wrong.

104
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:43,384
You're all so conceited, thinking we can all do it.

105
00:06:43,789 --> 00:06:46,865
That's why even though you're
wrong, you won't acknowledge it.

106
00:06:47,733 --> 00:06:50,741
You're just really looking to
gloss over your own failures.

107
00:06:50,766 --> 00:06:53,602
Resorting to scheming with all your useless empty words.

108
00:06:53,627 --> 00:06:56,053
Just to gain peace of mind through mutual assent.

109
00:06:56,738 --> 00:06:59,497
It's very easy to do that when
you can blame others, isn't it?

110
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:04,079
Actually, I feel like this is
simply a lack of communication.

111
00:07:04,233 --> 00:07:08,578
You know what... we should take another cool
down period and then regroup to discuss this.

112
00:07:08,603 --> 00:07:09,485
Agreed.

113
00:07:12,683 --> 00:07:16,414
If all you're going to do is play
make-believe, could you please go do it elsewhere?

114
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:23,582
From the beginning you've only been
saying words that have no real substance.

115
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:28,310
Is using words you've learned in a class that
mimics a make-believe job really that much fun?

116
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:32,138
You speak in terms that are
mistaken for actual communication here.

117
00:07:33,012 --> 00:07:35,132
Which means nothing actually gets done...

118
00:07:35,426 --> 00:07:37,463
There's no way to make progress like this.

119
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,187
{\an8}You won't produce anything.

120
00:07:40,389 --> 00:07:43,134
{\an8}You won't get anything. You won't help anything.

121
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:44,907
It's all so fake.

122
00:07:46,482 --> 00:07:47,344
Yukinon...

123
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:52,559
Seriously though, would you guys mind
not wasting anymore of our time here?

124
00:07:56,881 --> 00:08:02,120
Instead of working together, don't you think it would
be much better to have our guests enjoy double the fun?

125
00:08:02,145 --> 00:08:05,359
They'll experience the uniqueness of each school. Right?

126
00:08:05,448 --> 00:08:08,523
Uh, y-yes. I-I think that sounds good.

127
00:08:09,033 --> 00:08:11,062
So what do you think? Huh?

128
00:08:11,144 --> 00:08:15,496
Uh... Mhm. You can tell em that, too. Right? Right?

129
00:08:24,957 --> 00:08:29,723
I don't understand why you two had to go and
say all that now! Look how awkward it is in here!

130
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,907
I really don't think I said anything wrong or unfair.

131
00:08:33,162 --> 00:08:35,115
I agree it was a fair argument...

132
00:08:35,365 --> 00:08:37,667
but you really should learn to read the room better...

133
00:08:37,769 --> 00:08:38,947
Or something like that.

134
00:08:38,972 --> 00:08:42,464
If you actually expect this boy here to
read the room, you're wasting your time.

135
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,074
He can only read the lines of text that are in his books.

136
00:08:45,099 --> 00:08:48,237
Guess that's too bad huh?
However, as the resident bookworm,

137
00:08:48,313 --> 00:08:50,799
even I can read between the lines. So there.

138
00:08:51,139 --> 00:08:53,177
Besides, aren't you the one she's angry at?

139
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:56,248
No way. She just agreed that it was a fair argument.

140
00:08:56,383 --> 00:08:58,510
Therefore, your assumption is unjustified.

141
00:08:58,699 --> 00:09:01,862
Yup, there it is, that's exactly
why she's pissed at you now.

142
00:09:02,165 --> 00:09:03,288
Listen to what she's saying.

143
00:09:03,313 --> 00:09:04,515
Um, hello...

144
00:09:04,723 --> 00:09:06,917
Are YOU listening to me Hikigaya?

145
00:09:07,067 --> 00:09:09,038
I'm talking to the both of you, you know.

146
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:15,234
{\an8}Here you go.

147
00:09:16,993 --> 00:09:18,850
Oh, thanks...

148
00:09:20,087 --> 00:09:21,117
Cheers!

149
00:09:22,077 --> 00:09:22,949
Okay...

150
00:09:23,737 --> 00:09:25,282
You've changed a bit, haven't you?

151
00:09:25,558 --> 00:09:28,006
You were just so boring back when we were in school.

152
00:09:29,124 --> 00:09:30,407
Yeah? I was?

153
00:09:31,171 --> 00:09:36,194
Well, I, I mean yea I guess you were...
I suppose its in the eye of the beholder.

154
00:09:36,717 --> 00:09:39,931
Listen., I definitely don't
wanna go out with you or anything.

155
00:09:40,126 --> 00:09:43,114
Yeah, well I'm not asking you out or anything.

156
00:09:43,237 --> 00:09:43,959
True...

157
00:09:44,808 --> 00:09:47,227
But maybe we've got something going as friends.

158
00:09:47,365 --> 00:09:48,284
You're funny.

159
00:09:49,043 --> 00:09:51,839
So do you think you would come to the next reunion?

160
00:09:52,454 --> 00:09:53,867
Nope, absolutely not.

161
00:09:54,099 --> 00:09:55,775
I know, right? Funny.

162
00:09:55,826 --> 00:09:57,644
No, not funny at all.

163
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:01,405
Could you put it over there?

164
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:10,957
Hachiman, it's fine.

165
00:10:11,188 --> 00:10:13,281
I've got it. I don't need your help.

166
00:10:13,759 --> 00:10:15,807
Yeah, you say that, but you are...

167
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:16,327
Go.

168
00:10:24,712 --> 00:10:25,815
Just so you know...

169
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:28,170
I can do this way more alone than you can.

170
00:10:30,114 --> 00:10:32,293
Seriously though, you sound dumb.

171
00:10:36,937 --> 00:10:38,076
Hey, so you...

172
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,222
That's not my name.

173
00:10:39,247 --> 00:10:40,017
H-huh?

174
00:10:40,187 --> 00:10:40,842
Rumi.

175
00:10:41,888 --> 00:10:43,071
So, hey, Rumi...

176
00:10:46,105 --> 00:10:47,644
Would you like to be in our play?

177
00:10:54,123 --> 00:10:57,150
{\an8}Yuigahama. Did you finish packing the cookie bags?

178
00:10:57,357 --> 00:10:58,956
Mhm! I just finished them!

179
00:10:59,294 --> 00:11:01,063
Do you want me to help with the cakes, too?

180
00:11:01,088 --> 00:11:01,871
No, it's fine.

181
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:04,864
Actually don't you dare touch these cakes, okay?

182
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,041
For any reason.

183
00:11:06,073 --> 00:11:07,732
Could you say that in a nicer tone!

184
00:11:08,257 --> 00:11:12,206
Ohhhhh, maaaan! This is absolutely terrible.

185
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:15,340
The script is good, so you don't
need to worry that much, all right?

186
00:11:15,865 --> 00:11:19,344
That's because our secretary buckled
down and did her best work on this.

187
00:11:20,434 --> 00:11:22,654
And you... you really made it...

188
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:27,814
Oh, that's right, I'm going
to go see how everyone is doing.

189
00:11:28,887 --> 00:11:31,221
Oh, can you go confirm a few things?

190
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:34,013
Mainly the final timings for
the show with our vice president?

191
00:11:34,251 --> 00:11:36,741
And also, I'm counting on you for the cakes!

192
00:11:37,972 --> 00:11:40,522
Roger that... President.

193
00:13:38,265 --> 00:13:39,352
Welcome back.

194
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:41,058
Great work today, Yuigahama.

195
00:13:41,749 --> 00:13:43,089
Ahh Thanks!

196
00:13:50,396 --> 00:13:51,666
What in the world is this?

197
00:13:51,702 --> 00:13:53,233
Well it's a Christmas present!

198
00:13:53,258 --> 00:13:54,459
Don't you know using a paper cup is considered wasteful?

199
00:13:55,066 --> 00:13:57,810
Yeah, Yukinon chose the design. I chose the shape.

200
00:13:58,394 --> 00:14:02,906
Yeah, huh. Not fair, I didn't
get anything for either one of you.

201
00:14:03,332 --> 00:14:04,668
Hey, don't worry about it.

202
00:14:04,933 --> 00:14:06,807
It's just an upgrade from your paper cup.

203
00:14:07,675 --> 00:14:08,778
Well thanks you guys.

204
00:14:08,954 --> 00:14:10,289
{\an8}You're very welcome!

205
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:12,948
Oh and... for the request as well...

206
00:14:13,789 --> 00:14:15,522
I really thank you. You saved me.

207
00:14:16,024 --> 00:14:17,510
Because of you it ended well.

208
00:14:18,359 --> 00:14:20,143
The request isn't over yet, right?

209
00:14:22,431 --> 00:14:25,555
Don't you remember? I accepted your request?

210
00:14:26,406 --> 00:14:30,951
Yeah... but the request has been fulfilled and
all. So what is this some kind of weird riddle?

211
00:14:32,207 --> 00:14:34,606
Maybe. If you like riddles.

212
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,353
Oh, I totally get it now!

213
00:14:38,709 --> 00:14:41,197
But it's okay if Hikki doesn't get it... right?

214
00:14:42,279 --> 00:14:44,267
Well, regardless of your confusion,

215
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:46,834
It's still Christmas, so I
think we should have a party, okay?

216
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:48,001
No, I don't think so.

217
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:50,097
Do you have any plans, Yukinon?

218
00:14:50,497 --> 00:14:53,056
If we're going to have a party,
I can keep my schedule open.

219
00:14:53,081 --> 00:14:54,731
Really? Alright then!

220
00:14:54,756 --> 00:14:56,819
Aren't you going to ask me about my plans?

221
00:14:56,844 --> 00:15:00,140
Or is this a case of indirectly
insinuating I'm not invited?

222
00:15:00,165 --> 00:15:03,088
Well... we know there's no way you could have plans.

223
00:15:03,113 --> 00:15:05,552
Oh! I want to eat one of your cakes, Yukinon!

224
00:15:05,577 --> 00:15:07,662
But the cake you ate earlier was one that I made...

225
00:15:07,687 --> 00:15:11,654
<i>In all honesty, if wishes could be
granted for all who desire them...</i>

226
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:13,916
<i>If I could get what I wanted...</i>

227
00:15:15,564 --> 00:15:18,759
<i>I wouldn't wish for anything. Or want for anything.</i>

228
00:15:19,825 --> 00:15:24,464
<i>The things I can easily get are likely
never genuine. Nor what I really wanted.</i>

229
00:15:25,323 --> 00:15:27,069
<i>And I'll surely lose it one day...</i>

230
00:15:28,076 --> 00:15:30,802
<i>So I think... I will keep searching for it.</i>

231
00:15:44,808 --> 00:15:47,615
Hey, question for you.. Yukinon's birthday is coming up,

232
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:49,413
when can you and I go and get her a present?

233
00:15:49,585 --> 00:15:50,516
Oh, right...

234
00:15:51,601 --> 00:15:53,025
Are you free tomorrow maybe?

235
00:15:54,645 --> 00:15:56,855
Uh... yeah, I am.

236
00:15:57,492 --> 00:15:59,781
Okay, great. Tomorrow it is then.

237
00:16:00,297 --> 00:16:00,780
Kay.

238
00:16:03,442 --> 00:16:04,846
Oh, it's Yumiko.

239
00:16:05,447 --> 00:16:08,059
Y-Yahallo, Yumiko! Oh, wait a second!

240
00:16:09,405 --> 00:16:12,311
So um... What is everyone gonna do after this?

241
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:14,048
I think I'm gonna head home soon.

242
00:16:14,515 --> 00:16:16,401
I'm not that good with crowded places.

243
00:16:16,599 --> 00:16:18,100
Aww.. What about...

244
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:20,306
We'll see each other at school really soon, won't we?

245
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,736
Okay, shall we go?

246
00:16:26,538 --> 00:16:29,728
Oh, gosh darnit! I actually forgot
to buy a good-luck charm back there!

247
00:16:29,799 --> 00:16:33,645
And I also forgot to write a wish, so
I'm just gonna dash back and do that, too!

248
00:16:33,832 --> 00:16:35,639
Oh, if you're going to get a charm, maybe I should-

249
00:16:35,664 --> 00:16:40,531
What the heck are you even saying, bro?
Don't be Brotrash! Idiot! Halfwit! Hachiman!

250
00:16:40,686 --> 00:16:42,571
Hachiman isn't even an insult!

251
00:16:42,718 --> 00:16:45,337
Okay, goodbye Yukino! I'm heading off for now!

252
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:51,596
What's funny?

253
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:54,574
Idiot! Halfwit! Hachiman!

254
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,379
It seems like Yukinoshita's insult
dictionary has had a long-awaited update...

255
00:17:13,219 --> 00:17:15,970
I was just wondering if it's okay if we go this way?

256
00:17:16,175 --> 00:17:17,707
Uh... Yes.

257
00:17:17,901 --> 00:17:21,753
So, um... I was thinking since it's
New Year's, you'd be off with your family.

258
00:17:22,045 --> 00:17:24,536
Oh... I'm not going anywhere this year.

259
00:17:25,007 --> 00:17:27,240
I don't really have much going on to be honest.

260
00:17:27,584 --> 00:17:30,901
Besides, in the end it doesn't make a
big difference whether I'm there or not.

261
00:17:31,335 --> 00:17:32,747
Well then, isn't that okay?

262
00:17:33,867 --> 00:17:36,186
It's nice when it doesn't matter if you show up...

263
00:17:36,377 --> 00:17:37,752
because you're not bothering anyone.

264
00:17:37,947 --> 00:17:40,394
There are people in the world
who ruin things just by existing.

265
00:17:40,419 --> 00:17:42,424
<i>Next stop is Keisei Makuhari Station.</i>

266
00:17:42,449 --> 00:17:44,233
So was that a self-introduction?

267
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:48,630
Yes it is. And that's why I have come to
avoid dealing with people as much as possible.

268
00:17:51,894 --> 00:17:53,774
So.. This is where I get off.

269
00:17:55,044 --> 00:17:55,876
Hikigaya.

270
00:18:00,939 --> 00:18:02,498
I wish you a Happy New Year.

271
00:18:30,678 --> 00:18:32,818
Hey don't I look really intelligent now?

272
00:18:32,958 --> 00:18:37,010
Y'know, the idea that glasses equals
intelligence is already pretty unintelligent...

273
00:18:37,035 --> 00:18:38,564
Shut up, stupid! Hmph!

274
00:18:44,876 --> 00:18:47,107
{\an8}Oh hey, it's Hikigaya!

275
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:50,258
Look it's Haruno and Hayato?

276
00:18:51,785 --> 00:18:52,457
Hey there...

277
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:56,278
Oh, that's right.

278
00:18:56,414 --> 00:19:00,212
It's Yukino's birthday soon,
so that's why it's just you two.

279
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:04,043
I notice you two always seem to
get along quite well, don't you?

280
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:04,802
Uh-huh.

281
00:19:04,827 --> 00:19:07,029
My sister was with us earlier, but disappeared.

282
00:19:07,477 --> 00:19:08,717
Who knows were she is now?

283
00:19:09,429 --> 00:19:11,900
However, you two hanging out together is pretty rare.

284
00:19:12,316 --> 00:19:15,055
Ah... we're going to a New Year's dinner party.

285
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:18,289
Well, actually, our parents have
been close for a very long time.

286
00:19:18,909 --> 00:19:21,264
Which means we're together for holidays like this.

287
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,991
Our parents are off making the rounds somewhere right now.

288
00:19:26,229 --> 00:19:28,022
So we're here just waiting around.

289
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,735
Ah, yea I can see that.

290
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,778
Oh, I know.

291
00:19:37,390 --> 00:19:37,892
Hello?

292
00:19:38,189 --> 00:19:39,843
Ah, hello Yukino.

293
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:42,774
It's your big sister! Can you come over here now?

294
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:43,428
{\an8}I'm hanging up.

295
00:19:43,453 --> 00:19:45,615
Are you? You sure you want to do that?

296
00:19:46,065 --> 00:19:46,550
{\an8}What?

297
00:19:46,908 --> 00:19:48,118
Hold on, just a minute.

298
00:19:49,393 --> 00:19:50,231
Here you go.

299
00:19:50,467 --> 00:19:51,826
Uh! No wait...

300
00:19:57,102 --> 00:19:58,786
Uh... hello there.

301
00:19:59,092 --> 00:20:02,672
Huh? I can't believe it. Why are you over there?

302
00:20:03,016 --> 00:20:06,384
Uh, well actually... uh, that's
because we're here to, um...

303
00:20:08,256 --> 00:20:09,441
I'll be there soon.

304
00:20:12,582 --> 00:20:14,668
Ah, Yukinon! Over here!

305
00:20:17,812 --> 00:20:20,742
Yuigahama. Wow you're here, too?

306
00:20:21,019 --> 00:20:24,825
Uh I am! Well actually I was
already here out shopping with Hikki.

307
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:26,303
And we kinda got caught...

308
00:20:26,855 --> 00:20:28,553
Oh. So I see...

309
00:20:28,752 --> 00:20:30,597
Took you long enough, Yukino!

310
00:20:31,132 --> 00:20:34,277
Calling me out of the blue and
telling me to come here is shameless...

311
00:20:35,085 --> 00:20:39,081
Oh now, now... it actually seems like
you got here in quite a hurry Yukino...

312
00:20:41,428 --> 00:20:43,424
So uh what do you want to have to drink, huh?

313
00:20:43,689 --> 00:20:45,159
I'll have black tea please.

314
00:20:47,343 --> 00:20:50,515
It's been a while since we've all had tea, huh?

315
00:20:50,608 --> 00:20:51,755
It sure has.

316
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:53,959
Haruno.

317
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:58,366
Oh... have you finished?

318
00:20:58,839 --> 00:21:00,108
Yes we have.

319
00:21:00,661 --> 00:21:03,389
I'm so sorry to have kept you waiting, Hayato.

320
00:21:03,414 --> 00:21:06,230
It's okay, everyone here kept me pretty entertained.

321
00:21:08,453 --> 00:21:12,255
Well.. I'm glad to see you're
here, as well.. Yukino, dear.

322
00:21:12,556 --> 00:21:13,515
Hi, Mother...

323
00:21:21,036 --> 00:21:22,203
Are these your friends?

324
00:21:22,228 --> 00:21:23,690
They're Yukino's friends.

325
00:21:23,715 --> 00:21:25,778
Oh my goodness, I'm so sorry.

326
00:21:25,803 --> 00:21:29,832
You know I've never really met any of
Yukino's schoolmates outside of Hayato here.

327
00:21:29,857 --> 00:21:32,729
I sincerely hope you guys can
remain close friends with her.

328
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:33,282
'Kay!

329
00:21:34,912 --> 00:21:36,712
So, you guys ready to go?

330
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:37,879
Okay.

331
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:42,769
Yukino?

332
00:21:43,191 --> 00:21:44,179
I don't want to...

333
00:21:44,204 --> 00:21:47,087
This is also a birthday celebration for you, you know.

334
00:21:52,431 --> 00:21:54,816
Yukino, don't do this.

335
00:23:41,454 --> 00:23:43,202
These must be my real true colors.

336
00:23:43,227 --> 00:23:44,802
That's really why I couldn't let go.

337
00:23:44,827 --> 00:23:46,677
I locked it deep within myself.

338
00:23:46,702 --> 00:23:48,252
And I averted my eyes from the truth.

339
00:23:48,277 --> 00:23:50,845
I just wanted to be criticized and shown the light.

340
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:54,204
I wanted someone to see me, see
through the pretentious person I was.

341
00:23:54,229 --> 00:23:56,154
There were eyes looking in from the outside...

342
00:23:56,179 --> 00:23:57,827
and so I held high hopes.

343
00:23:57,852 --> 00:24:00,683
I thought that maybe finally
they might be able to find me.

344
00:24:00,708 --> 00:24:03,263
I really thought they might be able to look inside me.

345
00:24:03,288 --> 00:24:04,083
Reality.

346
00:24:04,201 --> 00:24:07,286
How can you be so sure that it's
not a figment of your imagination?

347
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,361
Is anything really genuine anymore?
