1
00:00:13,558 --> 00:00:14,918
So... See ya.

2
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:32,137
There's just one week left before
the big Christmas event, right?

3
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:35,583
I went to see how things were
going, but everyone had already left.

4
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:39,518
I was on my way home from the mall when
I looked over and saw you sitting there.

5
00:00:40,249 --> 00:00:40,741
Oh.

6
00:00:43,169 --> 00:00:44,809
Is this your car, Ms. Hiratsuka?

7
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,074
You had a different one during the summer didn't you?

8
00:00:48,132 --> 00:00:50,645
Yeah... that was just a rental car for camp.

9
00:00:51,085 --> 00:00:52,342
This one's my baby.

10
00:00:54,498 --> 00:00:55,273
Hikigaya...

11
00:00:57,124 --> 00:00:58,674
Do you mind if we make a quick stop?

12
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,333
Here we are.

13
00:03:09,061 --> 00:03:09,868
Hikigaya.

14
00:03:22,085 --> 00:03:24,099
You know... You look pretty cool there.

15
00:03:24,336 --> 00:03:26,228
It's because I'm acting really cool.

16
00:03:30,414 --> 00:03:32,055
So tell me.. How's it going?

17
00:03:32,618 --> 00:03:33,765
It's going pretty bad.

18
00:03:34,010 --> 00:03:35,785
Oh? What's bad about it?

19
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,238
Tough question. I don't know if I
can give a short answer for that one.

20
00:03:39,797 --> 00:03:41,458
Come on.. Just give it a try.

21
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:43,016
'Kay...

22
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:45,856
Well...

23
00:03:48,704 --> 00:03:50,727
I guess the big problem is our timing.

24
00:03:51,188 --> 00:03:52,580
We just have one week left...

25
00:03:52,789 --> 00:03:55,015
And I don't know how to solve the situation we're in.

26
00:03:55,951 --> 00:03:59,033
Tamanawa and Isshiki.. They're both really scared.

27
00:03:59,564 --> 00:04:01,906
They don't want to be blamed for things that may go wrong,

28
00:04:02,264 --> 00:04:07,884
so to avoid taking responsibility, they just go about
gathering everyone's opinions and accepting them all.

29
00:04:08,125 --> 00:04:11,305
The result of that.. Is this
current stagnant situation we're in.

30
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,272
Where it's not clear on who's supposed to be
leading, and who is shouldering the most responsibility.

31
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:18,540
That was our first mistake.

32
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:22,211
Well I guess it's something along those lines.

33
00:04:25,008 --> 00:04:26,072
You look closely...

34
00:04:27,212 --> 00:04:30,251
And you really excel at figuring
out what people are thinking.

35
00:04:31,227 --> 00:04:31,905
That's not true...

36
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:32,781
However,

37
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:36,111
you just don't understand their feelings.

38
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,723
People's thoughts and emotions aren't always the same...

39
00:04:41,356 --> 00:04:46,015
That's why they sometimes seem to come to
completely irrational conclusions that confuse us.

40
00:04:46,628 --> 00:04:51,918
That's also why Yukinoshita, Yuigahama,
and you yourself, give the wrong answers.

41
00:04:51,943 --> 00:04:55,756
Wait... Those two are not involved
with the project I'm currently working on.

42
00:04:55,781 --> 00:04:59,571
Well actually.. I was asking about
those two from the start, Hikigaya.

43
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:09,455
But I guess... Both of them are the same inside...

44
00:05:09,641 --> 00:05:11,943
Which means there's one thing at the root of this:

45
00:05:12,848 --> 00:05:13,802
It's the heart.

46
00:05:15,104 --> 00:05:19,007
Maybe but that's not really something I
can just think about and understand... is it?

47
00:05:20,538 --> 00:05:21,685
You just don't get it, huh?

48
00:05:22,668 --> 00:05:24,459
Well then.. Think about it some more.

49
00:05:25,132 --> 00:05:27,509
Keep calculating until there's nothing left.

50
00:05:27,848 --> 00:05:30,826
Think up all the answers, then squash them one by one,

51
00:05:31,604 --> 00:05:34,287
and then what's left.. Is your answer.

52
00:05:36,873 --> 00:05:40,661
Yea but still... Doesn't mean that
it'll help me understand any better?

53
00:05:40,854 --> 00:05:44,873
Okay... then your calculations are
wrong.. Or you've missed something.

54
00:05:45,053 --> 00:05:47,019
So you should do your calculations again.

55
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,419
You're crazy, you know that?

56
00:05:49,573 --> 00:05:50,580
And you're an idiot!

57
00:05:50,874 --> 00:05:54,270
If you could calculate feelings,
we'd have them on hard drives by now.

58
00:05:54,857 --> 00:05:57,384
The last answer, the one you're unable to solve.

59
00:05:57,664 --> 00:05:59,904
That's what we call human emotions.

60
00:06:01,936 --> 00:06:04,876
I know... I also make those kind of mistakes

61
00:06:04,901 --> 00:06:08,621
when I do my own calculating, which
is probably why I'm still on the market.

62
00:06:08,943 --> 00:06:11,136
Just the other day, one of my friends got married...

63
00:06:11,995 --> 00:06:14,784
See... That's because nobody's got good taste in women.

64
00:06:15,237 --> 00:06:15,712
Huh?

65
00:06:17,576 --> 00:06:19,591
<i>If I had been born ten years earlier,</i>

66
00:06:20,337 --> 00:06:21,968
<i>and if we had met ten years ago,</i>

67
00:06:22,956 --> 00:06:25,482
<i>I think that maybe I would have fallen for her hard.</i>

68
00:06:26,295 --> 00:06:28,344
<i>It means nothing to think about that now, though.</i>

69
00:06:28,369 --> 00:06:30,108
Whaa... Where did that come from?

70
00:06:30,359 --> 00:06:31,913
Well.. Okay then.

71
00:06:32,254 --> 00:06:36,079
As a way of thanking you for that..
I'm going to give you a special hint here.

72
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:40,578
When you sit and think...

73
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:43,586
You need to figure out and make
sure you focus on the right point.

74
00:06:43,786 --> 00:06:44,598
For example,

75
00:06:45,352 --> 00:06:50,213
think about why you are helping Isshiki,
not as a member of the service club, but by yourself.

76
00:06:50,279 --> 00:06:52,159
Try to think about why you did that.

77
00:06:52,478 --> 00:06:55,696
Was this for the service club.. Or for Yukinoshita?

78
00:06:57,217 --> 00:06:58,813
I could tell just by looking.

79
00:06:59,259 --> 00:07:02,961
After the election issue..
Yukinoshita came to me about it.

80
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:06,900
You know she doesn't really talk about herself..

81
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:09,468
But I could tell how she felt by the way she was acting.

82
00:07:10,685 --> 00:07:12,171
Are you the same way in that regard?

83
00:07:12,797 --> 00:07:15,477
Uh.. Well. I don't really know.

84
00:07:15,561 --> 00:07:18,651
Well if you hold anywhere near
the same beliefs that she does..

85
00:07:18,868 --> 00:07:23,339
Then you wind up thinking that in order to not
hurt those you care for, you must push them away.

86
00:07:23,364 --> 00:07:24,814
In my opinion anyway.

87
00:07:25,246 --> 00:07:26,936
Of course it's all hypothetical.

88
00:07:27,062 --> 00:07:28,564
Yeah, I guess so.

89
00:07:28,951 --> 00:07:30,659
In a hypothetical situation.

90
00:07:30,936 --> 00:07:33,414
However, that's not what you should be thinking about.

91
00:07:33,687 --> 00:07:38,492
For instance.. You should really stop and think
expressly about why you don't want to hurt them.

92
00:07:38,926 --> 00:07:40,741
And you should have that answer immediately.

93
00:07:42,225 --> 00:07:43,984
They have become important to you...

94
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:45,579
So you do not wish to hurt them.

95
00:07:47,445 --> 00:07:48,901
But, you know, Hikigaya...

96
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,821
It's impossible to never hurt anyone.

97
00:07:52,947 --> 00:07:57,384
Simply just by existing... We'll
unconsciously manage to hurt someone.

98
00:07:57,935 --> 00:08:01,059
They do it when they are living, and
even still do it after they've died.

99
00:08:02,045 --> 00:08:07,128
They do it by getting involved... Even if they
try not to get involved, they'll still hurt someone.

100
00:08:08,396 --> 00:08:10,379
However when it's someone you don't care about,

101
00:08:10,563 --> 00:08:12,092
you won't even notice if you hurt them.

102
00:08:12,574 --> 00:08:14,762
What's necessary is self-awareness.

103
00:08:14,936 --> 00:08:18,295
When you feel like you're hurting
someone... It proves that you care about them.

104
00:08:19,534 --> 00:08:21,454
That's what caring for people is about.

105
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:25,393
You must be prepared to hurt that
person even when you try not to.

106
00:08:30,091 --> 00:08:31,411
That's my hint for you.

107
00:08:32,209 --> 00:08:36,942
Sometimes people will lose out on things, because
they're thinking about protecting someone else.

108
00:08:37,536 --> 00:08:40,244
But... That isn't something you should be sad about.

109
00:08:40,704 --> 00:08:43,254
Maybe, it's something you should be proud of.

110
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:45,771
I don't know, that all sounds so hard.

111
00:08:46,024 --> 00:08:47,937
Yeah. It can be hard.

112
00:08:48,484 --> 00:08:51,041
You can do it. Because I was able to do it.

113
00:08:52,816 --> 00:08:56,110
Maybe so... But assuming people can do what you can..

114
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,070
Is a little presumptuous.

115
00:08:58,237 --> 00:09:00,460
Seriously, you are such a brat!

116
00:09:02,195 --> 00:09:03,161
Okay, then.

117
00:09:04,087 --> 00:09:05,114
I'll be honest.

118
00:09:05,844 --> 00:09:08,877
You know... It might not even have to be you that does it.

119
00:09:09,494 --> 00:09:11,024
Someday in the future...

120
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:13,650
Yukinoshita herself may change.

121
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:17,708
Maybe someone that can even
understand her will appear before her.

122
00:09:18,495 --> 00:09:21,077
Or there might be someone who
will come and break down her walls.

123
00:09:22,035 --> 00:09:24,929
That's also true... of Yuigahama as well.

124
00:09:26,917 --> 00:09:28,790
Maybe.. Someday huh?

125
00:09:30,183 --> 00:09:34,088
To all you guys, the present feels
like it's the most important thing ever.

126
00:09:34,763 --> 00:09:36,412
But that is in no way true.

127
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,272
You can always balance things out eventually.

128
00:09:39,682 --> 00:09:41,546
That's how the world works after all.

129
00:09:43,163 --> 00:09:43,876
However,

130
00:09:44,309 --> 00:09:46,753
That said, I think it would be nice if it were you.

131
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:51,505
I have hope that you and Yuigahama will
get in and break down Yukinoshita's walls.

132
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:53,265
Well...

133
00:09:54,126 --> 00:09:56,341
Easier said then done... As you know.

134
00:09:57,922 --> 00:10:00,015
Remember the present isn't everything...

135
00:10:00,289 --> 00:10:04,614
But... there are things you can do
now... that can only be found here.

136
00:10:05,074 --> 00:10:06,333
And the time is now.

137
00:10:06,963 --> 00:10:07,827
It's right now.

138
00:10:09,717 --> 00:10:13,336
Just keep on thinking and
struggling. Flounder in your distress.

139
00:10:13,783 --> 00:10:15,789
If you don't do that, it isn't genuine.

140
00:10:24,855 --> 00:10:25,628
Yea but...

141
00:10:26,461 --> 00:10:29,427
It doesn't mean you're being
genuine just because you're struggling.

142
00:10:29,947 --> 00:10:32,911
Oh wow you really are a royal brat, aren't you?

143
00:10:50,022 --> 00:10:54,159
<i>My current obstacle is of course the big
joint Christmas event that's looming over us.</i>

144
00:10:55,563 --> 00:10:58,434
<i>And with that, Iroha Isshiki's issue has reared its head.</i>

145
00:10:58,594 --> 00:11:01,468
<i>And everything is entangled in Rumi Tsurumi's situation.</i>

146
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:04,186
<i>What is the most suitable solution to these problems?</i>

147
00:11:04,328 --> 00:11:05,900
<i>I don't think I can fix this alone.</i>

148
00:11:06,025 --> 00:11:09,492
<i>Should I ask for help? Why am I
trying to lean on others so soon?</i>

149
00:11:09,695 --> 00:11:12,485
<i>The bonds between people are like some types of drugs.</i>

150
00:11:12,719 --> 00:11:14,867
<i>Before you know it, you've become dependent on them.</i>

151
00:11:15,113 --> 00:11:18,219
<i>During the student council
election, Komachi was my reason.</i>

152
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:19,619
<i>"Do it for Komachi."</i>

153
00:11:20,232 --> 00:11:21,718
<i>That was my excuse to act.</i>

154
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,286
<i>No..I had to do this my way.</i>

155
00:11:25,317 --> 00:11:28,745
<i>I was probably wrong at the
time... and most likely still am.</i>

156
00:11:29,176 --> 00:11:33,190
<i>I need to act based on the answer,
the reason that I find for myself.</i>

157
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:35,307
<i>Yukinoshita and Yuigahama...</i>

158
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,060
<i>Why didn't I want to let those two run for president?</i>

159
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,873
<i>Until I got a reason...</i>

160
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:42,325
<i>My real reason to act was...</i>

161
00:11:51,684 --> 00:11:53,404
<i>Because there was something I wanted.</i>

162
00:12:21,132 --> 00:12:21,840
Come in.

163
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:35,775
Hikki.

164
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,417
Something wrong? You actually knocked and all...

165
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:43,153
I said you don't have to force yourself to show up.

166
00:12:43,692 --> 00:12:45,289
But I'm here for a reason now.

167
00:12:46,939 --> 00:12:47,725
Have a seat.

168
00:13:07,621 --> 00:13:08,672
What's going on?

169
00:13:09,163 --> 00:13:11,098
You're acting a little different than normal.

170
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,694
I've come to make a request.

171
00:13:20,496 --> 00:13:23,171
A request? You're actually going to speak to us now?

172
00:13:24,586 --> 00:13:27,067
You know the Christmas event Isshiki came to us about?

173
00:13:27,935 --> 00:13:29,698
It's way more difficult than I thought.

174
00:13:30,868 --> 00:13:32,407
So I'd like to ask for your help.

175
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:34,003
Yea but...

176
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:36,102
No.. I know what you want to say.

177
00:13:36,608 --> 00:13:38,370
I took it all upon myself..

178
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:40,835
And I said it wouldn't help Isshiki in the end.

179
00:13:41,281 --> 00:13:44,241
But I'm the one that advised her
to be student council president.

180
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:46,324
Do you remember the students at camp this summer?

181
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:49,583
That girl is participating.. But it's like before.

182
00:13:49,675 --> 00:13:51,589
I do.. Her name is Rumi, right?

183
00:13:51,653 --> 00:13:53,450
See, I really want to do something.

184
00:13:53,848 --> 00:13:56,739
I know because of what I've done,
I've caused all these problems.

185
00:13:57,062 --> 00:13:59,032
And by coming here I'm being selfish...

186
00:13:59,418 --> 00:14:01,828
Wanting your help. Needing it.

187
00:14:07,164 --> 00:14:11,910
So that means... you admit to this being your fault?

188
00:14:12,655 --> 00:14:14,549
Yeah.. I can't deny it.

189
00:14:16,115 --> 00:14:16,602
Right.

190
00:14:23,009 --> 00:14:25,763
Since you are responsible for all of this by yourself...

191
00:14:26,202 --> 00:14:28,669
Then you should also be able to solve it all by yourself.

192
00:14:33,861 --> 00:14:34,372
Right.

193
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,071
My bad... Forget I asked.

194
00:14:39,272 --> 00:14:39,834
Wait.

195
00:14:40,353 --> 00:14:41,394
It's not like that...

196
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,551
It doesn't have to be! This is wrong!

197
00:14:44,804 --> 00:14:46,722
She's right. I should fix it myself.

198
00:14:47,186 --> 00:14:50,530
It's perfectly natural to do
that. I need clean up after myself.

199
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,491
It is.

200
00:14:51,515 --> 00:14:52,413
It's not!

201
00:14:52,438 --> 00:14:54,822
Both of you are totally wrong about all this!

202
00:14:55,335 --> 00:14:58,183
Look.. You aren't the only one responsible here.

203
00:14:58,445 --> 00:15:01,880
You might've thought of the idea...
And you might have even carried it out..

204
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,070
But we're no better in this either!

205
00:15:04,379 --> 00:15:06,098
We forced all of this on you.

206
00:15:06,965 --> 00:15:08,780
No.. That's not really true here.

207
00:15:08,805 --> 00:15:09,740
Yes, it is!

208
00:15:10,014 --> 00:15:11,410
It's not just your fault..

209
00:15:11,435 --> 00:15:13,362
Things HAVE gotten weird around here..

210
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:15,983
And I'm just as.. Responsible to...

211
00:15:16,379 --> 00:15:16,871
I...

212
00:15:19,798 --> 00:15:23,185
Yukinon what you said just now... Is unfair in my opinion.

213
00:15:23,963 --> 00:15:25,645
Now you're going to go and say that?

214
00:15:26,693 --> 00:15:28,071
You are a coward as well.

215
00:15:31,468 --> 00:15:34,724
Wait.. This is not what I want
to talk about, nor why I came here.

216
00:15:34,868 --> 00:15:36,642
Yukinon.. You've said nothing.

217
00:15:37,151 --> 00:15:39,845
There are things that you have to
tell us, or we won't ever get it.

218
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:41,656
You never said anything either.

219
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,893
From the beginning you've acted
as if nothing was the matter.

220
00:15:45,711 --> 00:15:47,370
I thought.. That you-

221
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:51,406
that's how you both wanted things to be... then...

222
00:15:53,308 --> 00:15:55,838
"There are things that you have
to tell us, or we won't get it."

223
00:15:57,815 --> 00:16:00,983
But then... There are things that
we won't get even if you do say it.

224
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:02,830
That's not what I...

225
00:16:03,604 --> 00:16:07,515
Maybe I can't... Maybe I can't
accept it, even if you say it out loud.

226
00:16:08,348 --> 00:16:12,192
I'd probably think there's some other
reason for it, or some sort of ulterior motive.

227
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,724
Or some other selfish reason for telling me.

228
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:16,432
But, if..

229
00:16:17,241 --> 00:16:18,860
If we actually talk about it...

230
00:16:19,238 --> 00:16:21,926
And have conversations... Then we...

231
00:16:21,986 --> 00:16:22,919
But that's not it.

232
00:16:26,192 --> 00:16:28,853
It's arrogant to think something
like that would be understood.

233
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:34,130
The pretension of the person who said it...
And conceit of the person it was told to...

234
00:16:34,529 --> 00:16:38,088
There are many things that you won't
absolutely understand if you just talk about it.

235
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:42,253
That's why... I don't just want words.

236
00:16:44,778 --> 00:16:45,799
That's not true...

237
00:16:46,292 --> 00:16:49,071
If nobody says something, then how can you understand!

238
00:16:50,049 --> 00:16:53,827
Yeah... Expecting people to
understand without words is delusional.

239
00:16:55,574 --> 00:16:56,087
But...

240
00:17:01,793 --> 00:17:02,343
But I...

241
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:05,853
I...

242
00:17:08,647 --> 00:17:09,325
I just...

243
00:17:10,836 --> 00:17:12,587
I don't only want words.

244
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,457
There was certainly something that I wanted all along.

245
00:17:16,276 --> 00:17:22,410
Not understanding each other, becoming good friends, being
together, sharing together... Or anything else like that.

246
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:24,403
I don't need to be understood.

247
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,547
I want to understand.

248
00:17:27,406 --> 00:17:29,075
To understand. To know.

249
00:17:29,399 --> 00:17:32,292
I want to know and have peace. I want to be at ease.

250
00:17:32,439 --> 00:17:35,047
Because the things that I don't know are frickin' scary.

251
00:17:35,190 --> 00:17:40,470
Wanting to understand completely is a terribly
self-righteous, tyrannical, arrogant desire.

252
00:17:40,654 --> 00:17:42,792
It's really disgraceful and nauseating.

253
00:17:43,105 --> 00:17:46,073
Holding that desire is so disgusting I can't stand it!

254
00:17:47,073 --> 00:17:47,575
But, if...

255
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,650
If, we can both share that desire,

256
00:17:51,628 --> 00:17:54,838
if we can burden each other
with that ugly self-satisfaction...

257
00:17:55,544 --> 00:17:57,948
and if we can allow that relationship to exist...

258
00:18:00,411 --> 00:18:03,499
I know that that relationship is completely impossible!

259
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:07,234
I know that type of thing is not within my reach!

260
00:18:08,914 --> 00:18:09,547
And yet-

261
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:18,263
And yet, I find...

262
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:20,893
I...

263
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,281
I really...

264
00:18:26,565 --> 00:18:28,007
want something genuine.

265
00:18:35,676 --> 00:18:36,695
Oh Hikki...

266
00:18:38,137 --> 00:18:41,175
I don't.. Really understand.

267
00:18:49,022 --> 00:18:49,890
I'm sorry.

268
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:53,480
Yukinon!

269
00:19:01,381 --> 00:19:02,082
Hikki!

270
00:19:02,946 --> 00:19:03,712
Let's go!

271
00:19:03,737 --> 00:19:04,922
No way.. I'm not going.

272
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:06,664
Yes you are, we're gonna go together!

273
00:19:06,689 --> 00:19:08,535
Yukinon said she didn't understand...

274
00:19:08,577 --> 00:19:11,395
I also think she doesn't know
what to do in this type of situation,

275
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:13,725
and come to think of it I don't know either. But..

276
00:19:13,805 --> 00:19:16,322
We can't let whatever we have end without knowing!

277
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:17,745
Now or never!

278
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:20,101
This is the first time I've seen Yukinon like this!

279
00:19:20,983 --> 00:19:23,431
Come on.. We have to go after her...

280
00:19:32,572 --> 00:19:34,146
I can walk on my own fine.

281
00:19:35,795 --> 00:19:36,416
Let's go.

282
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:43,889
U..Um hey..

283
00:19:43,942 --> 00:19:46,443
I was going to come in but you seem to be in a hurry...

284
00:19:46,481 --> 00:19:47,397
We really are.

285
00:19:47,597 --> 00:19:48,497
We gotta go.

286
00:19:50,065 --> 00:19:53,218
Uh... there's no meeting today. Wanted you to know.

287
00:19:53,276 --> 00:19:54,133
A-And uh...

288
00:19:54,158 --> 00:19:55,133
Okay.. Got it.

289
00:19:55,504 --> 00:19:56,084
Wait...

290
00:19:56,340 --> 00:19:58,487
Please just stop and listen to me for a second...

291
00:19:58,821 --> 00:20:01,473
If you're looking for her she's upstairs. Go!

292
00:20:02,723 --> 00:20:03,492
Thanks for that.

293
00:20:24,562 --> 00:20:25,447
Yukinon!

294
00:20:27,896 --> 00:20:29,225
I don't understand it.

295
00:20:33,898 --> 00:20:37,284
I don't get what you mean by "genuine?" I'm confused.

296
00:20:37,764 --> 00:20:38,615
That's why...

297
00:20:43,036 --> 00:20:44,960
It's okay.. Yukinon.

298
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,317
What do you mean it's okay?

299
00:20:47,740 --> 00:20:50,954
If we're being honest here.. I
didn't really understand myself.

300
00:20:52,602 --> 00:20:56,399
So... if we talk about it, we'll understand it better...

301
00:20:56,879 --> 00:20:59,820
But... Maybe even then we won't understand, right?

302
00:21:00,387 --> 00:21:04,775
And that's fine.. We may never
really come to understand it.. I mean...

303
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,790
I can totally see us not ever being able to get it.

304
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,598
So maybe I don't understand after all.

305
00:21:14,654 --> 00:21:15,408
But, you know...

306
00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:17,207
I really...

307
00:21:19,959 --> 00:21:23,108
Seriously.. Hate the way things are right now!

308
00:21:26,484 --> 00:21:28,599
Hey now.. Why are you crying?

309
00:21:33,228 --> 00:21:34,673
I really was right, huh?

310
00:21:36,819 --> 00:21:37,932
Coward.

311
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:54,821
Hikigaya.

312
00:21:55,667 --> 00:21:56,138
Yeah?

313
00:21:58,824 --> 00:22:01,172
As for your request... I accept.

314
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:03,109
Thank you

315
00:22:04,016 --> 00:22:05,246
im gonna help, too.

316
00:22:08,285 --> 00:22:09,220
I appreciate it.

317
00:23:42,874 --> 00:23:44,261
Beer is the best!

318
00:23:44,341 --> 00:23:47,016
It was so not me, delivering that cool speech.

319
00:23:47,096 --> 00:23:49,590
Way to go, me! I'm a great teacher!

320
00:23:49,615 --> 00:23:51,226
No, a great woman.

321
00:23:51,399 --> 00:23:54,071
Why can't a great woman like me get married?

322
00:23:54,118 --> 00:23:58,051
'Scuse me! Can I get a chicken
wasabi? And a husband while you're at it!

323
00:23:58,091 --> 00:23:59,181
Just kidding!

324
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,734
Ugh, it's almost Christmas.

325
00:24:00,759 --> 00:24:03,804
Makes me sick. If only I didn't have to work.

326
00:24:03,829 --> 00:24:06,535
If I didn't have to work, I
could party all through Christmas!

327
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,232
Can I get a highball, please!

328
00:24:09,411 --> 00:24:10,905
I wanna get married.
