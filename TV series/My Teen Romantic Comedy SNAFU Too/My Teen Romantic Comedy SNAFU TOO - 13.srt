1
00:00:03,227 --> 00:00:05,340
About the other day... I'm sorry.

2
00:00:06,016 --> 00:00:06,897
No problem!

3
00:00:07,291 --> 00:00:10,585
My mom is always trying to tell me
that I stay out much too late, too.

4
00:00:10,868 --> 00:00:13,180
Yeah... that's what moms are supposed to do.

5
00:00:13,723 --> 00:00:15,321
They're always complaining about something.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:19,089
And with the entrance exams coming up and all,

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,222
Komachi and our mom have really been going at each other.

8
00:00:22,247 --> 00:00:25,023
Oh that's right, Komachi has her exams tomorrow.

9
00:00:25,275 --> 00:00:27,205
We even get the whole day off because of it.

10
00:00:27,440 --> 00:00:30,850
Knowing Komachi, I think she's going
to end up being just fine tomorrow.

11
00:00:31,112 --> 00:00:31,827
Yeah.

12
00:00:31,852 --> 00:00:34,343
But as her big brother, you must be worried, right?

13
00:00:34,368 --> 00:00:35,491
I find that I am.

14
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:38,719
I mean, Komachi's really cute,
so she'll surely be popular.

15
00:00:38,786 --> 00:00:40,675
That means she'll have to be careful around guys,

16
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,484
and she'll need to be sure to keep people from
finding out about her useless, no good, worthless brother.

17
00:00:45,509 --> 00:00:47,238
It would surely ruin her good reputation.

18
00:00:47,275 --> 00:00:48,818
THAT'S what you're worried about now?

19
00:00:48,843 --> 00:00:50,478
You act like she's already passed!

20
00:00:50,584 --> 00:00:53,858
Are you trying to be positive
or negative? I can't really tell?

21
00:00:54,277 --> 00:00:56,898
Oh! Yukinon? Did you make those cookies yourself?

22
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:58,398
Uh... yeah.

23
00:00:58,618 --> 00:01:01,345
In fact I baked up this batch of cookies last night.

24
00:01:05,215 --> 00:01:06,410
That sounds nice.

25
00:01:06,608 --> 00:01:08,896
I've been trying really hard with baking cookies.

26
00:01:08,973 --> 00:01:10,140
But I'm still struggling.

27
00:01:10,322 --> 00:01:11,662
These cookies are for you.

28
00:01:11,687 --> 00:01:13,515
Wow! Thank you so much!

29
00:01:16,369 --> 00:01:18,995
But, uh... Is this all for me?

30
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:23,614
<i>Why am I looking away?</i>

31
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:26,955
What about Hikki?

32
00:01:39,753 --> 00:01:40,851
You can have some.

33
00:01:41,035 --> 00:01:42,477
Uh... Thank you.

34
00:03:22,732 --> 00:03:23,378
See ya.

35
00:03:23,692 --> 00:03:24,772
Yeah, later!

36
00:03:25,262 --> 00:03:25,792
Uh...

37
00:03:33,827 --> 00:03:34,538
Well, um...

38
00:03:41,893 --> 00:03:45,246
So uh... Yeah.. I'm gonna head on out now!

39
00:03:49,857 --> 00:03:50,962
So then, uh...

40
00:03:52,459 --> 00:03:54,799
Well... what should we do now?

41
00:04:00,046 --> 00:04:02,419
Yukino... I'm here to pick you up.

42
00:04:02,517 --> 00:04:03,379
Sis?

43
00:04:05,249 --> 00:04:07,742
I don't think there is any need
for you to come and pick me up.

44
00:04:07,767 --> 00:04:11,870
Mom told me to stay with you for now.
So you better do what she says, okay?

45
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:15,236
Why is this happening all of a sudden?

46
00:04:15,329 --> 00:04:17,157
Really? I think you know why.

47
00:04:18,697 --> 00:04:21,878
Well, it's just, that's something I have to do myself.

48
00:04:21,951 --> 00:04:23,168
It has nothing to do with you.

49
00:04:23,209 --> 00:04:25,526
Do you even you have a so-called "self"?

50
00:04:26,221 --> 00:04:28,950
You've just been following in my footsteps up until now.

51
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,099
Do you even think on your own?

52
00:04:31,836 --> 00:04:35,106
You've always been free to do as
you please in your own built castle,

53
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:37,932
but you've never decided anything on your own.

54
00:04:38,925 --> 00:04:41,009
Even now, you don't know how to act.

55
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:46,747
What exactly is it? What do you want to do?

56
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:49,542
Do you think that you could
possibly do this fight somewhere else?

57
00:04:50,615 --> 00:04:52,916
I don't think this is a fight where having now.

58
00:04:52,941 --> 00:04:55,669
After all, we've never had any kind of fight before.

59
00:04:56,145 --> 00:04:59,242
Well, either way.. This isn't
a discussion to have in public.

60
00:05:01,998 --> 00:05:04,347
Yeah... so... we are thinking about it...

61
00:05:05,018 --> 00:05:06,937
Both Yukinon... and me, too.

62
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:11,725
Oh? Yeah? Well, tell me about it when you get home.

63
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:15,838
I mean, it's not like you have anywhere else to go?

64
00:05:15,903 --> 00:05:17,361
It's just you and me.

65
00:05:19,131 --> 00:05:26,044
Umm... uhh... so, uh.. Oh, yeah! Wanna come over?

66
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:33,590
I came along with them without a second thought...

67
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:38,502
I'm sorry, guys. I didn't mean to cause you trouble.

68
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:40,477
Not at all. Don't worry.

69
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,162
That's right! Don't worry about anything at all, my dear!

70
00:05:45,391 --> 00:05:47,348
So you must be, Hikki... right?

71
00:05:47,373 --> 00:05:47,995
Yeah.

72
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,178
Yui has told me so much about you.

73
00:05:50,203 --> 00:05:52,266
Mother! You don't have to tell him that!

74
00:05:52,291 --> 00:05:55,046
But I want to talk to Hikki and get to know him, too!

75
00:05:55,071 --> 00:05:56,532
You don't have to!

76
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:59,460
Oh, I know. Yukino's staying over, right?

77
00:05:59,623 --> 00:06:00,533
She'll need a futon and clean sheets.

78
00:06:00,558 --> 00:06:01,846
I'll take care of that!

79
00:06:05,162 --> 00:06:06,779
Sorry about my mom and all.

80
00:06:06,804 --> 00:06:08,560
She's really happy you came over.

81
00:06:08,597 --> 00:06:10,460
She doesn't usually get this excited...

82
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,740
I'm so embarrassed.

83
00:06:11,765 --> 00:06:12,673
It's alright.

84
00:06:12,978 --> 00:06:15,941
You two are close, huh? I'm a little jealous of that.

85
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:22,484
With family like that, it'd be hard for anyone, let
alone Yukinoshita, to have a good relationship with them.

86
00:06:23,976 --> 00:06:26,660
I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said something like that.

87
00:06:26,933 --> 00:06:28,264
I think I'll be leaving now.

88
00:06:28,289 --> 00:06:31,410
Oh, I was actually just thinking why don't you stay?

89
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:33,007
But I couldn't...

90
00:06:33,032 --> 00:06:35,350
You have me sleep over at your house all the time...

91
00:06:35,717 --> 00:06:37,601
and I don't think you want to go home.

92
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:41,780
Plus, I bet you wouldn't be able
to talk it out peacefully right now.

93
00:06:42,098 --> 00:06:45,028
Why don't you spend the night here
so you can at least think it over?

94
00:06:45,379 --> 00:06:47,436
But still let your sister know, just in case.

95
00:06:47,461 --> 00:06:48,964
Yeah. You should do that.

96
00:06:50,466 --> 00:06:53,119
Okay, then. I guess you're both right about that.

97
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:58,792
Hello, sis?

98
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:04,193
I don't think we'll be able to
talk this out peacefully tonight.

99
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:06,484
I'm going to spend the night thinking it over.

100
00:07:07,518 --> 00:07:09,153
I'm letting you know, just in case.

101
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,413
{\an8}Oh? Okay.

102
00:07:13,972 --> 00:07:16,692
Hikigaya is with you too, right? Give him the phone.

103
00:07:24,449 --> 00:07:27,004
Here go Hikki... she wants to talk to you.

104
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:31,607
What is it?

105
00:07:31,766 --> 00:07:35,139
You know... You're always so nice, Hikigaya.

106
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:54,527
Are you still awake?

107
00:07:55,830 --> 00:07:56,473
Yeah.

108
00:07:57,993 --> 00:08:00,186
{\an8}What do you wanna do... Yukinon?

109
00:08:01,872 --> 00:08:02,721
I don't know...

110
00:08:03,176 --> 00:08:06,095
{\an8}Well, I do know... just what I wanna do...

111
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:08,212
{\an8}I've made up my mind.

112
00:08:09,936 --> 00:08:13,627
Tomorrow, will you go on a date with me?

113
00:08:16,509 --> 00:08:17,556
I'm sorry?

114
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:20,470
It's so cold!

115
00:08:20,495 --> 00:08:21,707
You have your exam ID?

116
00:08:22,072 --> 00:08:24,629
And an eraser and handkerchief? And an extra pencil?

117
00:08:24,654 --> 00:08:25,729
I've got it.

118
00:08:26,478 --> 00:08:28,033
I'm on my way, then, big bro!

119
00:08:28,505 --> 00:08:30,385
Kay. Be careful out there.

120
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,482
Sine, cosine, tangent...

121
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:36,715
Looks like it's gonna snow all day.

122
00:08:44,257 --> 00:08:45,930
Hikki, let's go on a date!

123
00:08:47,885 --> 00:08:48,373
What?!

124
00:08:57,719 --> 00:09:00,894
If I'm in the way here, I can
leave... It's no problem at all.

125
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:02,101
It's... fine.

126
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:07,992
Seriously you guys... I want us to be together.

127
00:09:14,118 --> 00:09:15,546
The Sea Life Park?

128
00:09:18,606 --> 00:09:19,798
Is this really okay?

129
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:22,788
Yeah! We don't have to worry about snow in here.

130
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,765
Yay! Sharks!

131
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:28,449
Sharks, huh?

132
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,412
Yukinon! Sorry I didn't tell you earlier.

133
00:09:31,445 --> 00:09:33,323
We should get more excited, okay?!

134
00:09:33,537 --> 00:09:35,124
Easier said than done.

135
00:09:36,481 --> 00:09:38,829
Whoa... look at all those hammerhead sharks!

136
00:09:38,856 --> 00:09:41,218
Wait so you're allowed to take pictures in here?

137
00:09:43,325 --> 00:09:45,472
See? Hikki is having fun here, too!

138
00:09:51,129 --> 00:09:51,576
Wh-what?

139
00:09:51,871 --> 00:09:54,487
Nothing, I was just a little surprised is all.

140
00:09:55,355 --> 00:09:57,910
How about... I take a picture with you and the sharks.

141
00:09:57,957 --> 00:10:00,424
Really? Komachi's gonna be so jealous.

142
00:10:04,868 --> 00:10:06,899
It says it's a nurseryfish.

143
00:10:07,692 --> 00:10:09,980
They live in muddy streams but don't swim much.

144
00:10:10,051 --> 00:10:13,012
They're known for carrying their
egg clusters on forehead hooks.

145
00:10:13,149 --> 00:10:14,003
So cool.

146
00:10:14,430 --> 00:10:15,090
Yeah.

147
00:10:15,565 --> 00:10:18,602
And they get to eat shrimp and
whatever else that passes them by.

148
00:10:19,329 --> 00:10:20,788
They really live the perfect life.

149
00:10:20,813 --> 00:10:22,121
You're envious of that?!

150
00:10:22,202 --> 00:10:26,131
Wow, now that I've really taken a
look at it, this fish resembles someone.

151
00:10:26,518 --> 00:10:28,060
Isn't that right Fishigaya?

152
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,734
Hey, we're nothing alike and leave my name out of it.

153
00:10:30,917 --> 00:10:32,965
Ew... Gross... nasty!

154
00:10:33,982 --> 00:10:35,849
You shouldn't say means things like that.

155
00:10:36,336 --> 00:10:38,066
They're doing their best to survive.

156
00:10:38,335 --> 00:10:40,545
Alright well I guess they're kinda cute.

157
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:43,464
Well, I don't know if you can call them cute,

158
00:10:43,703 --> 00:10:45,264
but they certainly are charming.

159
00:10:46,892 --> 00:10:48,611
You can't exactly call them "cute"

160
00:10:49,171 --> 00:10:51,497
if you've already established them as "gross."

161
00:10:53,056 --> 00:10:54,849
Ooh, a dogfish shark!

162
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:57,244
{\an8}It kinda looks like Sable!

163
00:10:57,269 --> 00:10:57,811
How's that?

164
00:10:57,892 --> 00:11:00,257
A catshark? That makes no sense.

165
00:11:00,833 --> 00:11:03,829
They must be like cats in some
way if they've taken their name.

166
00:11:05,742 --> 00:11:08,394
She reacts to anything with cat in its name, huh?

167
00:11:08,776 --> 00:11:11,427
She really does love cats. How frisky.

168
00:11:12,506 --> 00:11:15,168
It kinda feels like a cat's tongue when I touch it.

169
00:11:15,461 --> 00:11:16,552
That's shark skin.

170
00:11:16,818 --> 00:11:18,669
Ah, there's a ray, too.

171
00:11:19,191 --> 00:11:22,337
Oh gross! I just felt something that was super slimy!

172
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,805
What did you touch? Was it Hikigaya?

173
00:11:24,963 --> 00:11:26,714
You should hurry and go wash your hands.

174
00:11:27,835 --> 00:11:31,399
Could you stop treating me like that? I'm not a ray, okay?

175
00:11:32,659 --> 00:11:37,002
Cat... Catshark... Cat... Meow.

176
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:39,121
Or... shaa maybe?

177
00:11:39,146 --> 00:11:41,729
Just because it's a shark does not mean it goes shaa.

178
00:11:43,129 --> 00:11:44,904
That's it? You done already?

179
00:11:45,084 --> 00:11:49,445
Mhm. It wouldn't be fair to tire them out
because I'm touching them too much.

180
00:11:49,601 --> 00:11:52,028
I see. Well that's very you.

181
00:11:54,568 --> 00:11:57,894
And what exactly do you mean by "very me", Hikki?

182
00:11:58,513 --> 00:12:02,608
I bet you have an idea of me in your mind
but I'm not as nice of a girl as you think.

183
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:08,401
Ah Penguins!

184
00:12:08,569 --> 00:12:10,153
Come on guys we've gotta go see em!

185
00:12:13,062 --> 00:12:15,628
Oh wow, they're so disgustingly cute!

186
00:12:15,785 --> 00:12:18,347
I need to get a picture of this for Komachi.

187
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:19,664
Look... look how they're swimming.. Isn't that so cute?

188
00:12:19,738 --> 00:12:22,749
Seeing them like this makes you
think they're kind of like birds, huh?

189
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,743
Uh Penguins are actually birds Yuigahama.

190
00:12:26,750 --> 00:12:27,570
I knew that.

191
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:40,278
What's up?

192
00:12:41,338 --> 00:12:42,711
I'm gonna go wait inside.

193
00:13:06,756 --> 00:13:07,880
Where's Yuigahama?

194
00:13:08,119 --> 00:13:10,466
She's taking pictures of the fairy penguins.

195
00:13:11,098 --> 00:13:11,546
Kay.

196
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:20,250
Some of them are left to themselves.

197
00:13:20,451 --> 00:13:22,618
Yeah... that one is pretty big, after all.

198
00:13:23,660 --> 00:13:27,028
Always unable to find a place to
belong without a pillar of support...

199
00:13:27,401 --> 00:13:29,672
Hiding in the crowd, going with the flow...

200
00:13:30,021 --> 00:13:32,029
following everyone else's paths...

201
00:13:32,422 --> 00:13:34,353
until it runs into an unseen wall.

202
00:13:34,682 --> 00:13:36,210
Which fish are you talking about?

203
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:37,627
Myself.

204
00:13:46,615 --> 00:13:48,177
Sorry to keep you waiting!

205
00:13:50,589 --> 00:13:53,685
Oh wow... they look like fireworks, huh?

206
00:13:54,013 --> 00:13:54,720
You think so?

207
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:57,206
Don't you? That one over there.

208
00:13:58,831 --> 00:14:00,212
"Frooom... pop!"

209
00:14:14,626 --> 00:14:15,777
Too close.

210
00:14:19,599 --> 00:14:21,237
I'm glad we did this.

211
00:14:23,750 --> 00:14:24,550
Together.

212
00:14:30,002 --> 00:14:30,835
Done!

213
00:14:31,745 --> 00:14:33,578
Unless.. You wanna do it again?

214
00:14:33,686 --> 00:14:36,872
No, that's ok. No point in seeing
the same places more than once.

215
00:14:36,897 --> 00:14:39,779
Y-yeah. I'm a bit tired now.

216
00:14:40,341 --> 00:14:42,891
Aw, really? I think it'd be fun.

217
00:14:43,495 --> 00:14:45,684
I mean, we still have some time. Don't we?

218
00:14:56,775 --> 00:15:02,476
Hiding its instability... it continues to turn so slowly.

219
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,838
Instead of making any progress...

220
00:15:06,993 --> 00:15:09,261
it just keeps going around in circles.

221
00:15:11,583 --> 00:15:14,227
Even so... eventually...

222
00:15:24,205 --> 00:15:26,405
Seems to be... almost done.

223
00:15:38,910 --> 00:15:40,230
What are we gonna do now?

224
00:15:41,071 --> 00:15:41,742
Go home?

225
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:43,804
That's not what I meant.

226
00:15:47,838 --> 00:15:51,049
- About Yukinon. - Also... me.

227
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:53,861
And about us.

228
00:15:55,493 --> 00:15:57,567
I'm confused... what do you mean?

229
00:16:17,696 --> 00:16:18,358
Hikki.

230
00:16:20,985 --> 00:16:21,503
Here.

231
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:27,904
As thanks for way back when.

232
00:16:39,186 --> 00:16:41,290
Do you remember... my request?

233
00:17:02,529 --> 00:17:06,391
Homemade cookies? You made these all by yourself?

234
00:17:06,416 --> 00:17:08,395
I did, but messed up on them a bit.

235
00:17:10,101 --> 00:17:13,727
You're incredible... I'm proud.. Yuigahama.

236
00:17:14,538 --> 00:17:17,292
Do you remember when I told you I'd try to do it myself...

237
00:17:17,526 --> 00:17:20,454
and do it my own way without
trying to be like other people?

238
00:17:20,794 --> 00:17:22,295
So this is how they turned out.

239
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:26,143
These are... a thanks for that.

240
00:17:27,531 --> 00:17:29,336
You already paid me back for that.

241
00:17:29,746 --> 00:17:30,749
Even so,

242
00:17:32,504 --> 00:17:34,050
they're a token of my thanks.

243
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,124
To be honest I want it all.

244
00:17:39,819 --> 00:17:41,939
What is now, and what will be in the future.

245
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:47,264
But that's just me being unfair. I'm also a coward.

246
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,640
However, I've made up my mind on this.

247
00:17:56,476 --> 00:17:57,223
I see...

248
00:17:58,082 --> 00:18:01,063
I worry that if we figure out how we feel about things,

249
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,424
we might not be able to keep things how they are.

250
00:18:04,272 --> 00:18:07,039
So now... this is my new final request.

251
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:11,489
Our task is to fix our problems.
Do you think we can do that?

252
00:18:13,250 --> 00:18:17,007
Hey Yukinon... is that battle still going on in our club?

253
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,928
Yes. The winner can make the loser do anything they want.

254
00:18:21,723 --> 00:18:26,133
I think I know how to solve the problem you have
right now... I mean at least I think I do, Yukinon.

255
00:18:26,993 --> 00:18:30,434
However I believe it's the same
solution to our problem as well.

256
00:18:31,378 --> 00:18:35,150
So, when I win... I'm going to take it all, okay?

257
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,316
She didn't actually come out and
say anything really specific here.

258
00:18:41,614 --> 00:18:44,108
Putting it into words would confirm it for all of us...

259
00:18:44,781 --> 00:18:46,161
so she kept avoiding it.

260
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:51,035
It's probably not fair, but
this is all I could come up with.

261
00:18:51,768 --> 00:18:54,255
I want us to stay this way forever.

262
00:18:55,365 --> 00:18:56,189
What do you think?

263
00:18:58,283 --> 00:19:00,311
Yuigahama isn't wrong about this.

264
00:19:01,485 --> 00:19:05,318
I have a feeling she was the only one
looking at the right answers from the beginning.

265
00:19:05,753 --> 00:19:08,901
Accepting her proposal would
make things easier for all of us.

266
00:19:09,504 --> 00:19:09,965
But...

267
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:15,324
Yukinon... Is that okay with you?

268
00:19:24,977 --> 00:19:27,297
Well... I...

269
00:19:27,524 --> 00:19:30,959
No... this is wrong. She's making a mistake.

270
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:34,549
I... don't want...

271
00:19:34,853 --> 00:19:37,876
Letting Yukinoshita leave her
future in someone else's hands,

272
00:19:38,866 --> 00:19:40,606
is in no way okay here.

273
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:42,488
I just...

274
00:19:47,915 --> 00:19:48,823
I think...

275
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,899
I think I would be okay with...

276
00:19:51,924 --> 00:19:52,272
No.

277
00:19:57,025 --> 00:19:58,691
I can't accept your proposal.

278
00:19:59,434 --> 00:20:00,936
This isn't being fair to her.

279
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,795
Yukinoshita needs to solve this on her own.

280
00:20:11,545 --> 00:20:14,336
"Yui Yuigahama... is a nice girl."

281
00:20:14,892 --> 00:20:17,220
I decided that without even thinking of the truth.

282
00:20:17,946 --> 00:20:20,210
"Yukino Yukinoshita... is a strong girl."

283
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:23,682
So I burdened her with the ideal image I had of her.

284
00:20:24,348 --> 00:20:27,270
Besides... that proposal's just...

285
00:20:28,972 --> 00:20:30,137
One big lie.

286
00:20:30,536 --> 00:20:34,452
I don't want vague answers. Or
any superficial relationships.

287
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,084
I'm totally serious... I don't want that.

288
00:20:38,803 --> 00:20:40,224
I'm know I'm being stupid.

289
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:43,257
And I know it'll never be that way.

290
00:20:44,238 --> 00:20:45,553
And I know how this will end.

291
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,264
I'll end up being left with nothing again.

292
00:20:49,756 --> 00:20:55,368
Even so... I want us to think...
to suffer... And struggle...

293
00:20:56,187 --> 00:20:56,846
And I...

294
00:21:11,504 --> 00:21:13,927
You know... I thought you'd say that.

295
00:21:28,198 --> 00:21:30,389
You do not get to decide how I feel here.

296
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,806
Anyways... this isn't the last request.

297
00:21:36,303 --> 00:21:37,209
Hikigaya...

298
00:21:39,102 --> 00:21:40,890
We still have your request, right?

299
00:21:47,881 --> 00:21:50,798
Even if we're wrong, it's okay...

300
00:21:51,397 --> 00:21:52,977
Because every time we are wrong,

301
00:21:53,528 --> 00:21:55,703
we will continue to look for the right answer.

302
00:21:56,672 --> 00:21:58,256
Oh... one more thing...

303
00:21:59,561 --> 00:22:00,990
I have a request.

304
00:22:02,177 --> 00:22:03,654
Can I tell you what it is?

305
00:22:07,473 --> 00:22:09,492
Sure. Let's hear it.
