[HIYORI] "The sea witch
handed the little mermaid

00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:24,139
a knife and said,

'Pierce the prince's heart,

I...

8
00:00:39,821 --> 00:00:42,115
Hey, uh...

9
00:00:42,198 --> 00:00:44,617
Oh, hi. Didn't know
you would be here.

10
00:00:44,701 --> 00:00:46,953
I gotta support
my friends, right?

11
00:00:48,997 --> 00:00:50,915
[HIYORI]
Friends, huh?

12
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:56,129
[MAKOTO] You know, when I
swam with you that time...

13
00:00:56,212 --> 00:00:57,380
I couldn't help but
feel like you were

14
00:00:57,464 --> 00:00:59,716
trying too hard at something.

15
00:00:59,799 --> 00:01:02,177
Trying too hard? Really?

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:04,012
Hate to tell ya, but that's
what you have to do

17
00:01:04,095 --> 00:01:06,473
to win tournaments.

18
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:08,475
That wasn't what I meant.

19
00:01:08,558 --> 00:01:10,977
I was talking about Ikuya.

20
00:01:13,104 --> 00:01:14,147
Do you think maybe you should

21
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:17,359
try to have a little
more faith in him?

22
00:01:17,442 --> 00:01:20,695
If you did, it'd probably
make swimming easier.

23
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,655
You could be yourself
in the water.

24
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:23,740
Tch.

25
00:01:23,823 --> 00:01:26,117
--It works for--
--[HIYORI] Let me guess.

26
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:27,744
Nanase.

27
00:01:29,037 --> 00:01:32,665
[HIYORI] That guy's the only
thing anybody ever talks about!

28
00:01:32,749 --> 00:01:36,711
Why'd he have to come back
into Ikuya's life like that?

29
00:01:36,795 --> 00:01:39,130
I just...

30
00:01:39,214 --> 00:01:42,258
I don't see what's
so great about him.

31
00:01:44,260 --> 00:01:47,263
[MAKOTO] I can't really explain
it, but I think if you swam

32
00:01:47,347 --> 00:01:50,392
with Haru, you'd understand.

33
00:01:50,475 --> 00:01:52,310
Seriously, there's something
special about him

34
00:01:52,394 --> 00:01:54,104
when he swims.

35
00:01:54,187 --> 00:01:56,481
[CROWD cheering]

36
00:01:56,564 --> 00:01:59,192
Sounds like its time
for Ikuya's race.

37
00:03:32,369 --> 00:03:35,622
[ANNOUNCER 8A] The third heat
of the men's 200-meter,

38
00:03:35,705 --> 00:03:37,123
individual medley will
begin momentarily.

39
00:03:37,207 --> 00:03:38,875
Hey, sorry I'm late.

40
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,960
They're starting now. Come on.

41
00:03:41,044 --> 00:03:44,089
Looks like I made
it just in time.

42
00:03:44,172 --> 00:03:45,507
It's weird.

43
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:47,008
Haruka used to swear up and down

44
00:03:47,092 --> 00:03:50,136
that he'd only swim free,
and now look at him.

45
00:03:51,554 --> 00:03:55,016
Well, everybody has to
grow up sometime, I guess.

46
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,560
Nanase from Hidaka's
in the next lane.

47
00:03:57,644 --> 00:04:00,063
Since when does <i>he</i> do IM?

48
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,067
[MIKOSHIBA] You guys were
pretty close with Kirishima

49
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,403
back in your middle school
days, weren't you?

50
00:04:06,486 --> 00:04:08,405
Yeah.

51
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:10,907
This'll be an
interesting race.

52
00:04:12,325 --> 00:04:15,370
[ANNOUNCER 7A]
Take your marks.

--[beep]
--[CROWD] Go!

00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:22,419
[KISUMI] Oh, the butterfly!
Haru's so good!

55
00:04:22,502 --> 00:04:24,087
Yeah, but...

56
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:25,588
Ikuya.

57
00:04:25,672 --> 00:04:28,174
That's unusual for him.

58
00:04:28,258 --> 00:04:30,427
It's like he's
fighting the water.

59
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:38,101
[NAO] Good turn. He's
obviously worked on that.

60
00:04:38,184 --> 00:04:40,478
I can't believe
he's never done this!

61
00:04:40,562 --> 00:04:41,813
Yeah.

62
00:04:46,026 --> 00:04:48,945
[IKUYA] Why can't I swim
the way I mean to?

63
00:04:49,029 --> 00:04:51,281
The water feels so heavy.

64
00:05:01,750 --> 00:05:03,376
[IKUYA]
Haru...

65
00:05:05,295 --> 00:05:09,841
[IKUYA] When he swims,
the water seems so liberated.

66
00:05:09,924 --> 00:05:12,052
He doesn't pin himself down,

67
00:05:12,135 --> 00:05:14,512
and he isn't limited by speed.

68
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:18,141
[IKUYA]
How can he be that free?

69
00:05:20,935 --> 00:05:24,105
[IKUYA]
Haru hasn't changed at all.

70
00:05:24,189 --> 00:05:27,609
No, the one who's
different... is me.

71
00:05:29,527 --> 00:05:31,154
[IKUYA]
I built a cage around my heart

72
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:33,615
without even realizing it.

73
00:05:36,076 --> 00:05:37,577
[IKUYA]
But now...

74
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:40,288
I think I finally understand
why I held onto swimming

75
00:05:40,372 --> 00:05:42,123
for all those years.

76
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:50,173
[IKUYA] I was just so afraid
of being left alone again.

77
00:05:50,256 --> 00:05:53,635
I was sure everybody
would end up abandoning me.

78
00:05:55,970 --> 00:06:00,016
[IKUYA] That's why I tried
to make myself stronger.

79
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:01,935
I thought if I could
stand on my own,

80
00:06:02,018 --> 00:06:05,397
then I'd be okay when the
world turned its back on me.

81
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:09,109
So I put all of my
energy into swimming.

82
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:13,530
Before long, I pushed
myself into a corner.

83
00:06:13,613 --> 00:06:15,240
But I know I was wrong.

84
00:06:15,323 --> 00:06:17,283
I was only running away.

85
00:06:18,576 --> 00:06:20,704
[IKUYA] I was scared of
loneliness, and I hid that

86
00:06:20,787 --> 00:06:23,415
by swimming like my
life depended on it.

87
00:06:24,708 --> 00:06:26,668
[IKUYA]
But I had it backwards.

88
00:06:26,751 --> 00:06:30,839
You don't get strong so
you can live life alone.

89
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,717
It turns out true strength
is the kind you gain

90
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:36,803
for the sake of the
people you care about.

91
00:06:36,886 --> 00:06:38,388
And the more you build it,

92
00:06:38,471 --> 00:06:41,725
the more you understand
what it means to be free!

93

I told you I'd keep my promise.

00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,955
So, you really did remember.

110
00:07:47,415 --> 00:07:49,709
How could I forget it?

00:07:54,673 --> 00:07:58,468
Haru. Thank you!

112

[NAO] Well. Looks like
everything worked out.

Yeah. Think so.

[HARUKA] Remember the
shooting stars we saw?

115

[IKUYA]
Oh, that's right.

116
00:08:24,828 --> 00:08:27,330
That meteor shower
was beautiful.

117
00:08:27,414 --> 00:08:30,250

what it was you wished for.

Uh--

126
00:08:47,183 --> 00:08:48,893
I just asked him what he wished
for at the training camp.

127
00:08:48,977 --> 00:08:50,311
Hey! Haru!

128

[ASAHI] Oh, sweet!
Come on, tell us everything!

129
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:56,026
[MAKOTO]
I wanna know, too!

130
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:58,862
All right, all right, fine--
the wish I made that night

131
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:01,197
was to be like Haru.

132
00:09:01,281 --> 00:09:03,783
I wanted to be a hero
the way he is.

133
00:09:03,867 --> 00:09:05,160
A hero?

134
00:09:05,243 --> 00:09:08,413
Yeah. Not the kind that
fights evil or whatever,

135
00:09:08,496 --> 00:09:09,998
but the kind that
everyone admires

136
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:11,708
and looks up to, you know?

137
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:13,460
I wanna be the type
of person who's always

138
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:16,671
there to help when
someone's in trouble.

139
00:09:16,755 --> 00:09:17,922
I don't get it.

140
00:09:18,006 --> 00:09:19,674
Someone's embarrassed.

141
00:09:19,758 --> 00:09:21,634
I am not.

142
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:25,555
But maybe you're
already someone's hero.

143
00:09:25,638 --> 00:09:26,556
I dunno.

144
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,099
Yeah, I think you could be!

145
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:31,853
You just don't realize it yet,
that's all. Like Haru here.

146
00:09:31,936 --> 00:09:33,313
Stop it.

147
00:09:33,396 --> 00:09:35,732
The best heroes don't think
of themselves as heroes--

148
00:09:35,815 --> 00:09:37,776
that's what makes 'em heroes!

head back in there.

00:10:12,018 --> 00:10:13,478
Yeah.

162
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,647
Wait a sec. What's wrong?

163
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:18,983
[HARUKA] Do you think Ikuya
really sees me as a hero?

164
00:10:19,067 --> 00:10:20,318
[gasps]

165
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:24,406
[MAKOTO chuckles] I'm sure
he's not the only one.

166
00:10:26,449 --> 00:10:29,369
[panting]

167
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,746
[IKUYA]
Hey.

168
00:10:42,424 --> 00:10:44,801
[HIYORI]
You were amazing out there!

169
00:10:44,884 --> 00:10:47,846
You sure know how to come
through when it counts.

170
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,810
Listen. I've given it
some thought, and...

171
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:56,604
I wanna start
swimming relays again.

172
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,067
[HIYORI]
With Nanase?

173
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:05,488
That's not what I'm
saying. Hear me out.

174
00:11:05,572 --> 00:11:07,741
[HOSHIKAWA]
Just the guy I wanted to see.

175
00:11:07,824 --> 00:11:08,950
[IKUYA]
Captain.

176
00:11:09,034 --> 00:11:10,326
That was quite a race!

177
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:13,079
It looked like you were
finally back in your groove.

178
00:11:13,163 --> 00:11:14,914
Thank you, sir,
I appreciate it.

179
00:11:14,998 --> 00:11:17,083
[HOSHIKAWA]
Let me ask you something.

180
00:11:17,167 --> 00:11:19,127
How do you feel about
the freestyle relay?

181
00:11:19,210 --> 00:11:21,463
It's the last event of
the college championships.

182
00:11:21,546 --> 00:11:24,215
If you swim like that
again, we can win.

183
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:29,429
Yes. I'd be honored to compete.

184
00:11:29,512 --> 00:11:31,014
Glad to hear it.

185
00:11:31,097 --> 00:11:32,182
[IKUYA]
But there's one condition.

186
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:35,352
[HOSHIKAWA]
Hm? Yeah, what's that?

187
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,228
[IKUYA]
Put Hiyori in it with me.

188
00:11:37,312 --> 00:11:38,730
Uh--

189
00:11:38,813 --> 00:11:40,482
[IKUYA] I've been
swimming IM for so long,

190
00:11:40,565 --> 00:11:43,902
my relay exchanges have
gotten kinda rusty.

191
00:11:43,985 --> 00:11:47,197
[IKUYA]
But, with Hiyori there,

192
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:50,033
I've no doubt I'll
be able to do it.

193
00:11:50,116 --> 00:11:51,576
You mean that?

194
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:53,661
That makes sense,
and I don't see

195
00:11:53,745 --> 00:11:56,289
any problem with putting
both of you in.

196
00:11:56,373 --> 00:11:58,625
How's that sound, Toono?

197
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:00,377
I'm not...

198
00:12:00,460 --> 00:12:02,003
[IKUYA] I realized,
despite how many years

199
00:12:02,087 --> 00:12:04,172
we've known each other,
you and I have never competed

200
00:12:04,255 --> 00:12:06,466
in one relay together.

201
00:12:06,549 --> 00:12:10,470
But that's what we should've
done from the start.

202
00:12:10,553 --> 00:12:14,808
So please, swim with me, okay?

203
00:12:20,689 --> 00:12:23,650
[HIYORI]
All right. Let's do it.

204
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,193
[GOU]
Check it out!

205
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:27,612
Haruka beat the qualifying time
in the 100-meter freestyle,

206
00:12:27,696 --> 00:12:29,447
just like we knew he would!

207
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,865
[NAGISA]
Whoa!

208
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:32,951
[ROMIO] And we know
what that means, right?

209
00:12:33,034 --> 00:12:35,870
He and Rin are finally gonna
race each other again!

210
00:12:35,954 --> 00:12:38,081
[gasps] Hold on, guys,
that's not all.

211
00:12:38,164 --> 00:12:39,666
He swam in the IM, too!

212
00:12:39,749 --> 00:12:40,834
Huh?

213
00:12:40,917 --> 00:12:42,711
Are you sure he's
talking about our Haru?

214
00:12:42,794 --> 00:12:45,130
The Haruka who only swims free?

215
00:12:45,213 --> 00:12:46,131
IM?

216
00:12:46,214 --> 00:12:48,049
It's the individual
medley, duh!

217
00:12:48,133 --> 00:12:50,176
Well, what kind of
results did he get?

218
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,720
He wasn't fast
enough to qualify,

219
00:12:51,803 --> 00:12:54,180
but he got second in his heat.

220
00:12:54,264 --> 00:12:55,974
And now he's getting
ready to swim

221
00:12:56,057 --> 00:12:57,475
in the freestyle relay!

222
00:12:57,559 --> 00:12:58,727
[REI]
What?!

223
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,478
The freestyle relay is
the absolute highlight

224
00:13:00,562 --> 00:13:02,355
of the college championships!

225
00:13:02,439 --> 00:13:04,733
There's gonna be a live
broadcast, isn't there?

226
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:07,444
I wanna watch Haru swim!

227
00:13:07,527 --> 00:13:10,447
Yeah, I wanna see, too!

228
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:11,948
[AYUMU]
Don't worry, guys.

229
00:13:12,032 --> 00:13:15,410
I saw this coming,
so in my infinite wisdom,

230
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,037
I got the AV room.

231
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,705
[SWIM CLUB]
Ah!

232
00:13:18,788 --> 00:13:22,000
[MOMOTARO]
Woo-hoo! Seijuro's up first!

233
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:23,460
Take the lead and keep it.

234
00:13:23,543 --> 00:13:25,712
That's the best strategy, huh?

235
00:13:26,713 --> 00:13:28,840
Yeah, but he's gotta
beat their captain,

236
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:31,051
Hoshikawa, the ace of Shimo U.

237
00:13:31,134 --> 00:13:34,554
This is a high-stakes
race, for sure!

238
00:13:34,637 --> 00:13:37,015
[SHIZURU]
That Chappy guy's the anchor.

239
00:13:37,098 --> 00:13:38,224
But he's a first-year!

240
00:13:38,308 --> 00:13:40,143
That's true, but once
you see him swim,

241
00:13:40,226 --> 00:13:42,937
I think you'll understand
why that's the case.

242
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:51,988
[whistle blowing]

243
00:13:52,072 --> 00:13:54,032
[MIKOSHIBA]
This year's championship

244
00:13:54,115 --> 00:13:55,950
belongs to Hidaka U.

245
00:13:56,034 --> 00:13:58,620
Huh. I could say
that you're wrong,

246
00:13:58,703 --> 00:14:00,747
but I'd rather show you.

247
00:14:08,797 --> 00:14:11,925
[ANNOUNCER 7A]
Take your marks.

248

[chuckles] Hope you're in
top form today, Archerfish.

Ugh. Give it a rest, Kiryuu.

'Cause today, I'm a bazooka.

So get ready to be blown away!

00:14:34,364 --> 00:14:37,951
[CROWD cheering]

255
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:41,621
Wait a second.

256
00:14:41,705 --> 00:14:43,123
You're feeling nervous,
aren't you?

257
00:14:43,206 --> 00:14:44,582
Me? No way.

258
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:47,002
I bet <i>you're</i> totally
freakin' out, though.

259
00:14:47,085 --> 00:14:48,294
Nah, I'm okay.

260
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:50,755
I've been giving myself
pep talks in the mirror.

261
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:54,843
"I am a genius. I am a genius".

262
00:14:54,926 --> 00:14:55,885
It helps a lot.

263
00:14:55,969 --> 00:14:58,179
Ah-- Hey, you jerk!
Don't mock me!

264

They're even!

268
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:18,908
[HARUKA]
Trust him.

269
00:15:22,704 --> 00:15:24,497
He's your friend, right?

270
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,503
No need to remind me.
I do trust him.

271
00:15:34,424 --> 00:15:35,800
Hiyori!

272
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,638
Haru!

273
00:15:48,772 --> 00:15:50,690
[HIYORI]
Right.

274
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:54,152
This is what Ikuya felt
during Nanase's free.

275
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:01,326
[MAKOTO] I can't really
explain it, but I think

276
00:16:01,409 --> 00:16:04,996
if you swam with Haru,
you'd understand.

277
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,664
Have a little more
faith in him.

278
00:16:06,748 --> 00:16:08,208
It would make swimming easier.

279
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:10,669
You could be yourself
in the water.

280
00:16:10,752 --> 00:16:14,172
[HIYORI]
Yeah, I <i>can</i> be myself.

Yeah, that was a total blast!

pretty incredible.

Eh, 70 points.

312

He still has room to improve.

You think he can
transform even more?

[AZUMA]
I'm sure of it.

he ends up transforming into.

Hey, Hiyori?

317

I've been thinking about
something that happened

318
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:15,794
when I was in kindergarten.

319
00:18:15,877 --> 00:18:17,420
There was this kid at
the swimming school

320
00:18:17,504 --> 00:18:19,339
I used to go to.

321
00:18:19,422 --> 00:18:21,716
He was always
swimming by himself.

322
00:18:24,511 --> 00:18:26,054
[IKUYA] I really wanted
to be friends with him,

323
00:18:26,137 --> 00:18:27,764
but I wasn't sure how.

324
00:18:27,847 --> 00:18:31,935
I guess... I had a hard time
knowing how to approach him.

325
00:18:32,018 --> 00:18:36,731
But eventually, I did. And...

326
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:38,525
...he smiled at me.

327
00:18:39,776 --> 00:18:43,488
[IKUYA]
It was a genuine smile.

328
00:18:43,571 --> 00:18:46,658
But not too long after that,
he had to move away,

329
00:18:46,741 --> 00:18:49,202
and I thought I'd
never see him again.

330
00:18:51,329 --> 00:18:52,997
[IKUYA]
Was that kid...?

331
00:18:57,752 --> 00:19:00,547
[HIYORI] You talk about
<i>his</i> smile, but your smile

332
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:03,174
was probably a
life-saver for him.

333
00:19:06,344 --> 00:19:10,348
I wouldn't be surprised
if you were his hero, Ikuya.

334
00:19:22,986 --> 00:19:24,279
Yo.

335
00:19:24,362 --> 00:19:25,780
Oh, hey.

336
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:28,658
Nice swimming. Congrats.

337
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:29,993
Thank you.

338
00:19:31,453 --> 00:19:33,455
[NATSUYA]
I'm really proud of you, Ikuya.

339
00:19:33,538 --> 00:19:35,206
You've worked hard for this.

340
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:38,293
[IKUYA]
Yeah.

341
00:19:39,836 --> 00:19:42,464
[NATSUYA]
Listen, I'm sorry.

342
00:19:42,547 --> 00:19:44,424
[IKUYA]
What are you apologizing for?

343
00:19:44,507 --> 00:19:46,092
[NATSUYA laughs]
You're right,

344
00:19:46,176 --> 00:19:48,303
maybe it's better
to say "thanks."

345
00:19:48,386 --> 00:19:50,472
I have a new dream now
because of you.

346
00:19:50,555 --> 00:19:52,015
Dream?

347
00:19:52,098 --> 00:19:55,352
That's right, for you and me
to take on the world together.

348
00:19:55,435 --> 00:19:58,730
And I'm not talking
about prize money, either.

349
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:00,899
It's more than that.

350
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:03,735
I wanna fight for
my strength and pride.

351
00:20:03,818 --> 00:20:06,529
To become number one
in the whole world.

352
00:20:06,613 --> 00:20:08,865
[IKUYA]
Are you... crying?

353
00:20:08,948 --> 00:20:09,866
You're crying.

354
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:11,826
[NATSUYA]
Shut up! Of course not.

355
00:20:14,037 --> 00:20:15,580
Natsuya?

356
00:20:15,663 --> 00:20:17,165
Hey, it's you!

357
00:20:17,248 --> 00:20:20,210
That was an awesome
exchange in there.

358
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:21,795
Congratulations.

359
00:20:21,878 --> 00:20:24,339
Thanks for sayin' so.

360
00:20:24,422 --> 00:20:26,299
[NATSUYA]
And, uh...

361
00:20:26,383 --> 00:20:28,927
I should tell you.
I'm sorry, Hiyori.

362
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:31,554
For leaving you to
protect Ikuya like that.

363
00:20:31,638 --> 00:20:34,641
It was too much of a burden
to expect you to bear alone.

364
00:20:34,724 --> 00:20:37,310
It's fine. I'm okay.

365
00:20:37,394 --> 00:20:40,313
Hey, don't call me a burden
like I'm not even here.

366
00:20:40,397 --> 00:20:42,440
Hah! Right, sorry.

367
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:44,609
Well, glad I got a
chance to see you both.

368
00:20:44,693 --> 00:20:46,152
I'm gonna head home now.

369
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,280
Later.

370
00:20:52,534 --> 00:20:54,828
Don't you think you
should go with him?

371
00:20:54,911 --> 00:20:56,121
[IKUYA]
Hm?

372
00:21:10,510 --> 00:21:12,470
[KISUMI]
You look bored or something.

373
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,264
I'm fine.

374
00:21:14,347 --> 00:21:17,392
I'm just weird how you only see
one side of people sometimes.

375
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:19,144
Um. Sorry.

376
00:21:19,227 --> 00:21:21,438
Oh! I'm Kisumi Shigino!

377
00:21:21,521 --> 00:21:24,149
By the way, do you wanna
join my Basketball Club?

378
00:21:26,693 --> 00:21:29,195
Let me think about it.

379
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:31,156
[MAKOTO]
Wow, you guys did great!

380
00:21:31,239 --> 00:21:34,701
Maybe both your teams could
have a joint practice sometime!

381
00:21:34,784 --> 00:21:36,536
I'll talk to the captain.

382
00:21:36,619 --> 00:21:37,787
I should warn you, though.

383
00:21:37,871 --> 00:21:40,165
Our practices can
be pretty tough.

384
00:21:40,248 --> 00:21:42,167
Asahi, you sure you can keep up?

385
00:21:42,250 --> 00:21:43,084
Are you kidding?

386
00:21:43,168 --> 00:21:45,045
My training regimen's hardcore!

387
00:21:45,128 --> 00:21:47,547
[IKUYA]
And what regimen is that?

388
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,549
[ASAHI] Well, I stand on
my head and do push-ups

389
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:51,009
while flutter-kicking
at the same time--

390
00:21:51,092 --> 00:21:52,302
[IKUYA]
Yeah right! You wish.

391
00:21:52,385 --> 00:21:53,845
That's not even possible.

392
00:21:53,928 --> 00:21:55,430
[ASAHI]
Hey! At least let me finish!

393
00:21:55,513 --> 00:21:56,556
[IKUYA]
Stupid Asahi.

394
00:21:56,639 --> 00:21:58,183
[MAKOTO]
I think that's enough, guys.

395
00:21:58,266 --> 00:21:59,184
[IKUYA]
Remember when you made up

396
00:21:59,267 --> 00:22:00,643
that dumb schedule
for training--

397
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:02,479
[ASAHI] The past has
nothing to do with this!

398
00:22:02,562 --> 00:22:04,564
[IKUYA]
Shut up! I think it does!

399
00:22:06,316 --> 00:22:08,568
[NAGISA] It's time for Haru
to challenge the world!

400
00:22:08,651 --> 00:22:10,153
[REI] Wait, I don't
recognize those guys.

401
00:22:10,236 --> 00:22:12,530
[NAGISA] Next time:
"Interval in the Evening Calm!"

402
00:22:12,614 --> 00:22:14,616
[NAGISA, REI]
Calm... Calm... Calm...
