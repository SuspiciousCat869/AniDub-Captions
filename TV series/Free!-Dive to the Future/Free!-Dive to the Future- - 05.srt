Hey, Coach Sasabe,
how much longer we got?

I'd say we have
about an hour left.

By the way, Ms. Amakata,

16
00:00:37,958 --> 00:00:40,083
I'd be more than happy
to take over driving.

17
00:00:40,166 --> 00:00:42,375
Oh, no! I'm perfectly fine!

18
00:00:42,458 --> 00:00:44,791
I don't get many chances
to drive big vans like this,

19
00:00:44,875 --> 00:00:46,208
so it's kind of fun!

Hey, Ayumu. You all right?

Never been better.

I appreciate all of you
making the trip to be here.

Thanks to the relationship
built between Samezuka

this training camp together.

I have to admit,
I'm a little disappointed

needs some fine-tuning,

a hesitation problem.

He's pretty good once he
gets in the water, though.

97
00:05:50,833 --> 00:05:53,500
Maybe he's just nervous today.

like to stay behind, Captain!

That's fine with me.

to overdo it, okay?

more on your form as you
move through the water.

You're in the same year.

138
00:08:09,958 --> 00:08:11,708
what might be troubling him?

139
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:16,625
Well, uh, maybe.

140
00:08:16,708 --> 00:08:18,125
[REI, GOU]
A false start?

141
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:20,916
Yeah. It was bad.

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,541
And it didn't help that
that was our last

143

middle school
tournament, either.

144
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:29,083
I'm guessing he's just
worried about making

145
00:08:29,166 --> 00:08:31,708
the same mistake again
in high school.

146
00:08:31,791 --> 00:08:34,041
And having all those
people around watching us

147
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,375
probably reminds him of
the day when it happened.

148
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:39,208
It was a big race.

Since then,

I've been completely

00:09:09,791 --> 00:09:11,625
[GOU]
Hope you enjoy!

160
00:09:11,708 --> 00:09:14,750
It's a big hit!
Kunikida is a great cook!

161
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:17,750
Yup! Guess that's the
magic of secret spices!

162
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:19,833
Right, Ayumu?

163
00:09:19,916 --> 00:09:21,083
[AYUMU]
Mm-hm.

164
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:22,625
And here's another batch
of the Kunikida family's

165
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:25,750
ultra-spicy curry
ready for serving!

166
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:29,125
Wow, Gou and her friend make
the greatest curry in the world!

167
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,625
It's almost too hot to handle.

168
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,625
[MOMOTARO]
Ooh, man, it burns so good!

169
00:09:35,666 --> 00:09:37,083
[USAMI]
Come on, Mikoshiba.

170
00:09:37,166 --> 00:09:39,083
That's what you consider spicy?

171
00:09:39,166 --> 00:09:40,250
[MOMOTARO]
You're already done?

172
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:42,458
Huh. Yeah, and I'm
on my way to get

173
00:09:42,541 --> 00:09:45,750
a heaping plate of seconds.

174
00:09:45,833 --> 00:09:47,583
Ready for more, Gou!

175
00:09:47,666 --> 00:09:49,000
Hey, what's your deal?

176
00:09:49,083 --> 00:09:51,458
You're not worthy of
Gou's amazing curry!

177
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:54,416
What? I've had it with you!

178
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,875
[NAGISA]
Mm! This is really yummy!

179
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:59,875
[GOU giggles] Ayumu gets
all the credit for that.

180
00:09:59,958 --> 00:10:01,375
[REI]
It's magnificent!

181
00:10:01,458 --> 00:10:03,916
[AYUMU] Thanks, it's an
old family recipe.

182
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,333
Huh? Seaweed?

183
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,791
But... Why would you...?

184
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,958
Because it tastes
better with seaweed.

185
00:10:14,041 --> 00:10:15,291
[ROMIO]
If you say so.

186
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:16,416
That looks great!

187
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,541
There's plenty more
if you want some.

188
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:20,916
Did you bring that along
from home, Shizuru?

189
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,166
[SHIZURU] Yeah. My family
runs a seafood store.

190
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:26,708
[ROMIO] They gather their
inventory by skin-diving.

191
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:29,541
That's how Shizuru became
such a talented swimmer.

192
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:31,083
Ah, that's interesting.

193
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,166
Uh-huh!

194
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,416
So, did you get to
eat a lot of curry

195
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:35,333
when you lived in New York?

196
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,375
Yeah!

197
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:37,666
[GOU]
I hear it's different there!

198
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,250
At this one place,
they're famous

199
00:10:39,333 --> 00:10:41,708
for serving up the
world's spiciest recipe!

200
00:10:41,791 --> 00:10:43,125
[GOU]
Oh, wow! No kidding?

201
00:10:43,208 --> 00:10:46,083
[AYUMU] How spicy is it?
Please, tell me everything!

202
00:10:46,166 --> 00:10:48,916
[ROMIO] It's so intense,
the chef wears a gas mask

203
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,875
while he's preparing it!

204
00:10:49,958 --> 00:10:51,208
[GOU]
No way!

205
00:10:51,291 --> 00:10:53,875
[ROMIO] It's true! I went
with my family one time!

206
00:10:54,958 --> 00:10:57,541
[NITORI]
So, for the last day of camp,

207
00:10:57,625 --> 00:11:00,166
I thought having a time trial
for each of the four strokes

208
00:11:00,250 --> 00:11:01,458
might be a good idea.

209
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:02,958
Works for me.

210
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:04,791
I dunno, it is the last day--

211
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:07,291
shouldn't we do
something special?

212
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:08,833
[NITORI]
Any thoughts, guys?

213
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,666
But of course.

214
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:14,583
Actually, if you don't mind,
we have a proposition.

215
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:20,208
[SWIM COACH 5A]
Let's say hello to our new

216
00:11:20,291 --> 00:11:23,083
swimming coach, everybody.

217
00:11:23,166 --> 00:11:25,000
Nice to meet all of you.

218
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:26,750
I'm Coach Tachibana.

219
00:11:26,833 --> 00:11:29,500
[applause]

220
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:34,000
People you swim with

221
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:36,916
all seem to end up
suffering, don't they?

222
00:11:43,291 --> 00:11:44,750
[sighs]

223
00:11:46,625 --> 00:11:49,083
[RIN]
What about you, though?

224
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,875
Don't you wanna get
to that point yourself?

225
00:11:57,791 --> 00:12:00,291
[NATSUYA]
Hey. Great day, huh?

226
00:12:03,541 --> 00:12:06,250
[NATSUYA] Haven't seen you
since the hot spring.

227
00:12:06,333 --> 00:12:08,291
Yeah.

228
00:12:08,375 --> 00:12:10,333
Listen, correct me if I'm wrong,

229
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:14,041
but do you have a
brother named Ikuya?

230
00:12:14,125 --> 00:12:15,125
Whoa, no way!

231
00:12:15,208 --> 00:12:16,666
So you guys know
each other then?

232
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,166
Uh, well, no.

233
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:21,083
It's just, I saw him swim
at nationals in high school.

234
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,291
Gotcha.

235
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,208
Yup. That was my little
brother, all right.

236
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,083
There was something remarkable
about the way he swam.

237
00:12:28,166 --> 00:12:31,583
Uh-huh! Can ya tell
how proud I am?

238
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:39,166
[SOSUKE] So, uh, what,
keeps you busy Kirishima?

239
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:41,250
[NATSUYA] Oh, y'know,
swimming wherever I want,

240
00:12:41,333 --> 00:12:42,916
whenever I want.

241
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,500
Travelling the world,
entering races.

242
00:12:45,583 --> 00:12:48,000
You meet a lot of
cool people that way.

243
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:49,291
Like, I was just in Australia,

244
00:12:49,375 --> 00:12:51,083
and I met this Japanese
guy who's been preparing

245
00:12:51,166 --> 00:12:53,875
for the global stage ever
since he was a little kid.

246
00:12:53,958 --> 00:12:56,500
I liked how solid and
straightforward he was.

247
00:12:56,583 --> 00:13:00,583
And obviously super
passionate about the sport.

248
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:01,666
[chuckles]

249
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:02,916
What's so funny?

250
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:06,291
Sorry. That reminds me
of somebody I know.

251
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:07,541
Oh, yeah?

252
00:13:07,625 --> 00:13:08,875
That's weird--one time
while we were talking

253
00:13:08,958 --> 00:13:11,291
he told me that I reminded
him of someone he knows.

254
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,958
A guy he wants to swim
with again someday.

255
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,916
Really? What a coincidence.

256
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,208
So, uh...

257
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:24,041
I heard you suffered
a shoulder injury.

258
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:25,458
How's it healin' up?

259
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:28,333
Not too bad.

260
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,416
The doctor says if I
keep up with my rehab,

261
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,291
I should be able to swim again.

262
00:13:32,375 --> 00:13:33,833
I probably won't
be strong enough

263
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,250
to compete anymore, though.

264
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:39,416
But, if I have surgery...

265
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,750
Then you could go
back to competitions,

266
00:13:41,833 --> 00:13:43,625
unless the treatment
didn't work out,

267
00:13:43,708 --> 00:13:46,000
which would ruin your
swimming career for good.

268
00:13:46,083 --> 00:13:47,375
Is that right?

269
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:55,666
That's a tough
choice for anyone.

270
00:13:57,458 --> 00:13:59,833
[NATSUYA]
Sosuke Yamazaki.

271
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:01,458
I didn't put it together
right away when I heard

272
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:03,833
you graduated from Samezuka.

273
00:14:03,916 --> 00:14:06,625
But you went to
Tokitsu High, too.

274
00:14:06,708 --> 00:14:07,875
You were famous
for your butterfly

275
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:09,833
back in those days, weren't you?

276
00:14:11,791 --> 00:14:13,958
Yeah, until I hurt my shoulder.

277
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:16,166
But if it healed up,
you'd be good enough

278
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,125
to compete internationally.

279
00:14:21,083 --> 00:14:22,875
[NATSUYA] Allow me to share
a few words of wisdom

280
00:14:22,958 --> 00:14:24,833
that I think'll
do you some good.

281
00:14:24,916 --> 00:14:26,500
They're from Mikhail,
the greatest coach

282
00:14:26,583 --> 00:14:29,166
to ever come out of the
Russian swimming world.

283
00:14:29,250 --> 00:14:31,208
He once said, "Victory
only comes to people

284
00:14:31,291 --> 00:14:32,791
who believe in themselves."

285
00:14:32,875 --> 00:14:36,458
Inspiring, huh? Those
words really struck me.

286
00:14:36,541 --> 00:14:41,583
What I heard was, "win or lose,
life is what you make of it."

287
00:14:41,666 --> 00:14:43,958
Next thing I knew,
I was on a plane.

288
00:14:45,958 --> 00:14:47,541
[NATSUYA]
Now that quote's my mantra.

[REI]
Well, this is it, team.

291
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,375
Tomorrow is the final day
of our training camp.

292
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,250
And for the grand finale,
we've decided to hold

293
00:14:57,333 --> 00:15:00,750
a medley relay between all
three schools in attendance!

294
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,041
That sounds awesome!

295
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:04,333
Um, the first-year guys, too?

296
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,208
[REI]
Naturally!

297
00:15:05,291 --> 00:15:06,541
Uh--

00:15:06,625 --> 00:15:09,875
Shizu's backstroke and
Romi's swimming freestyle!

299
00:15:09,958 --> 00:15:11,458
That's the first leg.

300
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:13,166
But it's way too soon!

301
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:15,541
And you want me
to be the anchor?

302
00:15:15,625 --> 00:15:18,625
I assure you, such apprehension
is entirely unwarranted.

We'll be right there
to support you.

304

We're just practicing.

00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:26,041
So we can have some fun with it!

Sorry. I just can't.

It's all right. Don't try
to carry this burden alone.

We're here to help you
overcome your fear.

313

This is a team, after all!

314
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:53,708
Being a team means all of us
are swimming toward one goal.

315
00:15:53,791 --> 00:15:54,750
That's right.

316
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:56,375
Your teammates have
got your back.

317
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,875
So lean on us! And just
dive in with all you've got!

318
00:15:59,958 --> 00:16:01,333
Okay?

319
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,708
[ROMIO]
Teammates...

320
00:16:07,791 --> 00:16:09,500
[SAMEZUKA SWIMMER 5C]
Remember to keep that energy up!

321
00:16:09,583 --> 00:16:10,666
[SWIMMERS]
Right!

322
00:16:10,750 --> 00:16:13,208
It's just practice,
but I'm here to win!

323
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:16,208
Rei and Nagisa really put
some planning into this, huh?

324
00:16:16,291 --> 00:16:17,500
Yes.

325
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:20,791
A relay competition.
Now that's not a bad idea.

326
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:23,375
The suggestion came
from Iwatobi High.

327
00:16:23,458 --> 00:16:25,583
They wanna grow as a team.

328
00:16:25,666 --> 00:16:26,958
Makes sense.

329
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:32,583
[REI] This brings back
memories of the very first

330
00:16:32,666 --> 00:16:35,500
relay we swam with
Makoto and Haruka.

331
00:16:35,583 --> 00:16:37,083
I know, right?

332
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,125
And we weren't really prepared
for it back then, either.

333
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:41,708
True.

334
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:44,791
Actually, that was my first time
participating in a relay, too.

335
00:16:44,875 --> 00:16:46,625
Perhaps all I managed
to do in that race

336
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:49,583
was hold the rest
of the team back.

337
00:16:49,666 --> 00:16:52,166
But still, the burning
emotion I felt when we all

338
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:56,000
swam together as a team
still lives on to this day.

339
00:16:56,083 --> 00:16:58,291
Deep in my heart.

340
00:16:58,375 --> 00:17:01,500
And now, it's the source
of all my confidence.

341
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:06,125
Yup!

342
00:17:06,208 --> 00:17:07,916
So I say we get ready to
have as much fun as we can

343
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,833
in this relay,
Iwatobi Swim Club style!

344
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,375
[REI, SHIZURU, ROMIO]
Okay!

345
00:17:12,458 --> 00:17:14,083
Well, the water's waiting!

346
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,041
There's still time to
back out if you're chicken.

347
00:17:19,125 --> 00:17:21,541
Yeah, in your
dreams, scaredy-cat!

348
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:29,000
[SAMEZUKA SWIMMER 5C]
Take your marks.

349
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,958
--[whistle blows]
--[SWIMMERS] Go!

350
00:17:31,041 --> 00:17:33,208
All right! Go, Shizu!

351
00:17:33,291 --> 00:17:34,833
[SAMEZUKA SWIMMER 5A]
Momo's in the lead!

352
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,916
[SAMEZUKA SWIMMER 5B]
Lookin' good, Momotaro!

353
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,041
[SOUFUUKAN SWIMMER 5A]
You can do it, Aoba!

354
00:17:42,791 --> 00:17:45,666
[AMAKATA]
You got this, Isurugi!

355
00:17:45,750 --> 00:17:47,666
[GOU]
Let's go!

356
00:17:54,666 --> 00:17:56,833
Iwatobi's smoking 'em!

357
00:17:56,916 --> 00:17:58,958
[GOU]
You're doing great, Nagisa!

358
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:01,833
[SASABE] Yeah, Nagisa,
that's how it's done!

359
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,125
[REI] Romio.

360
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,083
I promise, whatever happens,

361
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:10,791
I'll hand you a good
position in the relay.

362
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:13,166
So just dive in
with all your heart.

363
00:18:19,666 --> 00:18:21,083
Go, Rei!

364
00:18:24,958 --> 00:18:26,916
Awesome exchange.

365
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
[ROMIO]
Mm.

366
00:18:29,083 --> 00:18:31,541
[SOSUKE] Picture what
comes after you dive.

367
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,208
[ROMIO]
After I dive.

368
00:18:33,291 --> 00:18:34,416
[REI]
Being a team means all of us

369
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,416
are swimming toward one goal.

370
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:41,916
[ROMIO]
All of us.

371
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,625
[REI]
I promise, whatever happens,

372
00:18:43,708 --> 00:18:45,875
I'll hand you a good
position in the relay.

373
00:18:45,958 --> 00:18:47,750
Your teammates
have got your back.

374
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:49,500
So lean on us!

375
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:53,208
[SAMEZUKA SWIMMER 5D]
Whoa, it's close!

376
00:18:57,666 --> 00:19:00,833
Think about what your
reason for jumping in is.

377
00:19:00,916 --> 00:19:02,083
[ROMIO]
Right now...

378
00:19:02,166 --> 00:19:04,208
[REI] It's the source
of all my confidence.

379
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:06,666
[ROMIO]
This is it!

380
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,833
Not yet.

381
00:19:18,916 --> 00:19:20,000
That was perfect!

382
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,083
--[NAGISA] Great job!
--[SHIZURU] Romi!

383
00:19:21,166 --> 00:19:22,208
Yeah!

384
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,541
A clean start!

385
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,125
Ha, we showed you!

386
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:36,458
And that's the
power of Samezuka!

387
00:19:36,541 --> 00:19:39,000
[USAMI]
Hmph. You got lucky this time.

388
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,625
[MINAMI]
That was a good race.

389
00:19:40,708 --> 00:19:42,125
[NITORI]
Yeah, I agree!

390
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,583
You did it, Romi!

391
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,041
Whoa, Nagisa!

392
00:19:45,125 --> 00:19:46,416
You dove so well.

393
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:48,541
Yes, it was exquisite!

394
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:51,416
[ROMIO]
But, guys, we lost.

395
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:53,916
So? That exchange
was incredible!

396
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,166
Right!

397
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,083
[SHIZURU]
I'm... so proud of you.

398
00:19:57,166 --> 00:19:58,125
[ROMIO]
Hey! Um.

399
00:19:58,208 --> 00:20:00,458
Okay, you don't have
to cry about it!

400
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,083
[laughs] You're a
sensitive guy, huh?

401
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:05,166
[REI]
Shizuru, you were great as well!

402
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:07,083
I knew you could.

403
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:12,750
I got the same feeling
out there you did, Captain.

404
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:16,125
And because of that.
Now I'm even more frustrated!

405
00:20:16,208 --> 00:20:18,666
We have to win the next one!

406
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:21,041
Well, we just need
to work a lot harder!

407
00:20:21,125 --> 00:20:23,208
Indeed. All four of us.

408
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,000
Because we are a team!

409
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:26,125
[ROMIO, SHIZURU]
Yeah!

410
00:20:30,083 --> 00:20:32,333
[NATSUYA]
Yamazaki.

411
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:35,166
Have you made your mind up yet?

412
00:20:35,250 --> 00:20:37,000
Not yet. I, uh...

413
00:20:37,083 --> 00:20:41,333
[NATSUYA] Hey. What do ya
say we make a little bet?

414
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,708
A bet?

415
00:20:42,791 --> 00:20:44,208
[NATSUYA] If you can pick
which hand I'm hiding

416
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:47,000
the coin in, then
you keep believing

417
00:20:47,083 --> 00:20:50,833
in your dream and move
forward. No excuses.

418
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,583
Okay. And if I pick
the other hand?

419
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:58,666
[NATSUYA] If you choose that
one, you have to take a break.

420
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,291
Sometimes in life,
you gotta take the long road.

421
00:21:01,375 --> 00:21:04,125
Relax, loosen up a little.

422
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,166
Here goes.

423
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:09,708
Pick one.

424
00:21:14,916 --> 00:21:16,125
[SOSUKE]
The right.

425
00:21:17,416 --> 00:21:18,833
Final answer?

426
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:26,583
On second thought, never mind.

427
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,250
I'd rather decide for myself.

428
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,375
Good plan.

429
00:21:32,458 --> 00:21:33,708
Okay.

430
00:21:36,416 --> 00:21:38,750
Take care. It's been fun.

431
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:41,250
[SOSUKE]
Yeah.

432
00:21:46,125 --> 00:21:48,833
Yeah. I think he's gonna
turn out all right.

433
00:21:56,375 --> 00:21:57,625
[MISAKI]
Check it out, Coach!

434
00:21:57,708 --> 00:21:59,291
[MAKOTO]
Huh? What is it?

435
00:21:59,375 --> 00:22:00,541
Look!

436
00:22:00,625 --> 00:22:02,333
That's our old coach
who moved away before!

437
00:22:03,833 --> 00:22:06,750
[gasps] That's Nao!

438
00:22:11,541 --> 00:22:14,250
[NAGISA] The past. Events
that cannot be changed.

439
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:17,125
[REI] The future: a vision that
gives us hope and expectation!

440
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,541
[NAGISA] Next time:
"Mermaid of the Abyss!"
