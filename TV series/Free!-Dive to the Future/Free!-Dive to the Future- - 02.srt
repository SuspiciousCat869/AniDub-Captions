1
00:00:09,541 --> 00:00:10,875
[HARUKA]
Ikuya?

2
00:00:10,958 --> 00:00:12,583
--[HARUKA gasps]
--[ASAHI] Huh?

3
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:13,833
[ASAHI]
He's here?

4
00:00:13,916 --> 00:00:16,583
Where's he going? Hey, wait up!

5
00:00:16,666 --> 00:00:19,000
Excuse me, you guys,
it's an emergency!

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,666
[IKUYA] Why do you have
to quit swimming, Haru?

7
00:00:39,041 --> 00:00:42,875
[ASAHI panting]
Damn it, we lost him.

8
00:00:44,291 --> 00:00:45,708
Ikuya.

9
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:20,500
[TEAMMATES]
Go!

10
00:02:22,416 --> 00:02:24,916
[TEAMMATES]
Ikuya!

11
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
[MAKOTO]
Even Ikuya's getting beaten!

12
00:02:27,083 --> 00:02:28,916
How'd this happen?

13
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,791
[TEAMMATES]
Asahi!

14
00:02:30,875 --> 00:02:32,000
[MAKOTO]
Wow.

15
00:02:32,083 --> 00:02:34,791
The competition's
tougher at regionals!

16
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:41,291
Look at that.
He got faster again.

17
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:43,208
[GROUP]
Haru!

18
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:48,125
[ASAHI laughs]
He is so great!

19
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:52,250
Go, Haru!

20
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,291
[ASAHI]
Go!

21
00:02:58,291 --> 00:03:01,833
[ASAHI] Crap! We were
so close to victory!

22
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:04,083
Yeah, and we tried so hard, too.

23
00:03:04,166 --> 00:03:05,875
But it still wasn't
enough, was it?

24
00:03:05,958 --> 00:03:09,000
We're just gonna have to
practice more from now on!

25
00:03:09,083 --> 00:03:11,125
Yeah, you're right.

26
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:14,041
It's fine. We'll win the
next summer tournament.

27
00:03:14,125 --> 00:03:15,625
The four of us!

28
00:03:15,708 --> 00:03:16,875
Heck yeah!

29
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,541
Let's start our swimming
boot camp! Right now!

30
00:03:19,625 --> 00:03:21,416
[MAKOTO]
Hold on--slow down, Asahi!

31
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:23,541
Don't you think it's a little
too early for all that?

32
00:03:23,625 --> 00:03:25,041
[ASAHI]
Yeah, well, I can't help it!

33
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,833
I'm so pissed off
about losing today,

34
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,333
I wanna get to work
as fast as I can!

35
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:37,000
[HARUKA grunts] I told you,
I only swim free.

36
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,541
[IKUYA]
He even says it in his sleep.

37
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:39,583
[ASAHI whispering]
We should whisper stuff

38
00:03:39,666 --> 00:03:41,375
and see if it messes
with his dream!

39
00:03:41,458 --> 00:03:43,416
[MAKOTO] Can't we just wake
him up normally, please?

40
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,666
[ASAHI]
Aw, that's no fun!

41
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,208
Okay, fine, you won't
let me do that,

42
00:03:46,291 --> 00:03:48,708
so how about I just tickle
him until he goes crazy?

43
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:50,125
[MAKOTO]
Asahi, that's enough, okay?

44
00:03:50,208 --> 00:03:51,791
[ASAHI]
Got ya now, Ikuya!

45
00:03:51,875 --> 00:03:54,125
[HARUKA]
What's going on?

46
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:57,208
Well, we came to get you.
It's time for training camp!

47
00:03:57,291 --> 00:03:59,375
Yeah! We talked
about that, remember?

48
00:03:59,458 --> 00:04:02,291
We decided to camp out at the
school, just the four of us!

49
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,083
I already put in for
permission and everything!

50
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,166
And it's even okay
with my brother.

51
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,458
[MAKOTO]
Good swim. Here.

52
00:04:26,541 --> 00:04:28,333
Thank you.

53
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:31,250
[MAKOTO] Hey, look at
that. Check out Ikuya.

54
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:32,625
[HARUKA]
Free.

55
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:34,958
Whoa! That's so cool!

56
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:39,000
Ikuya's doing freestyle?
Look at him go!

57
00:04:39,083 --> 00:04:41,666
I'm not gonna let him
outdo me, though!

58
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,500
A training camp?
That sounds ambitious.

59
00:04:48,583 --> 00:04:49,708
Uh-huh.

60
00:04:49,791 --> 00:04:51,916
They wanna be ready
for next summer.

61
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,666
That's an early start.

62
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,458
Better than a late one.

63
00:04:57,208 --> 00:04:58,291
I've got an idea.

64
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,375
Why don't we bring
them some snacks?

65
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:04,291
[sighs] We have to try
not to spoil them too much.

66
00:05:05,333 --> 00:05:08,000
[GUARD 2A] Well, I'm here
if you boys need me.

67
00:05:08,083 --> 00:05:10,000
Okay, thanks a lot, sir!

68
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:16,666
[IKUYA]
Don't fall asleep, Asahi.

69
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,458
[yelps] What? No, I'm awake!

70
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:21,500
Hey, it's too early for that.

71
00:05:21,583 --> 00:05:23,250
We're just gettin' started!

72
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:25,000
It looks like the next
thing on the agenda

73
00:05:25,083 --> 00:05:28,291
is reflex training, then
weightlifting before bed.

74
00:05:28,375 --> 00:05:30,375
And practice is at sunrise.

75
00:05:30,458 --> 00:05:32,250
That's way too much work!

76
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:35,250
Weren't you the one who planned
everything out for us?

77
00:05:35,333 --> 00:05:37,458
Not that this thing
makes sense, anyway.

78
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:39,875
You didn't even schedule
a single break in here.

79
00:05:39,958 --> 00:05:41,875
What do you mean, "break"?

80
00:05:41,958 --> 00:05:43,500
We can't expect to win
the next summer tournament

81
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:46,250
if we're sitting around
on our butts all the time!

82
00:05:46,333 --> 00:05:47,916
That's a long way off.

83
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,750
You better not pile
all this work on us

84
00:05:49,833 --> 00:05:52,416
and then transfer away
to another school again.

85
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,708
Oh, yeah, that's a good point.

86
00:05:53,791 --> 00:05:55,958
Your family tends to
move around quite a bit.

87
00:05:56,041 --> 00:05:58,666
Guess it comes with the
territory with your dad's job.

88
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,833
No need to worry!

89
00:05:59,916 --> 00:06:01,916
I'm not gonna move ever again!

90
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,625
And besides, we'll never
get anything done

91
00:06:03,708 --> 00:06:05,958
if we keep focusing on
dumb stuff like that!

92
00:06:06,041 --> 00:06:09,083
The best thing for us to do
is just live life in the now!

93
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,541
[stomach growls]

94
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:14,041
[MAKOTO laughs]
Somebody's hungry!

95
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:15,500
[HARUKA]
Let's eat something.

96
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,166
Yes! Dibs on chicken sandwich!

97
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,250
[IKUYA]
What? Hey, that's not fair!

98
00:06:19,333 --> 00:06:20,625
We only have one
of those things!

99
00:06:20,708 --> 00:06:22,333
[ASAHI]
You snooze, you lose!

100
00:06:22,416 --> 00:06:23,875
[MAKOTO]
Don't fight!

101
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:30,458
[ASAHI snoring]

102
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,416
Huh?

103
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:48,708
Where's my towel?

104
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:03,583
Ikuya.

105
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:12,125
--[HARUKA] What're you doing?
--[gasps]

106
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,041
I thought you were all sleeping.

107
00:07:15,125 --> 00:07:18,625
I woke up, and then came
to get something that I left.

108
00:07:21,875 --> 00:07:23,166
Look up.

109
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,833
Huh?

110
00:07:24,916 --> 00:07:26,208
On the news, it said
there's gonna be

111
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:28,000
a meteor shower tonight.

112
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:32,791
[HARUKA] Oh, yeah, I heard
something about that.

113
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,833
[IKUYA] Hey. Have you ever
wished on a shooting star?

114
00:07:36,916 --> 00:07:39,208
'Course not. When
you want things,

115
00:07:39,291 --> 00:07:41,333
you have to make them happen.

116
00:07:41,416 --> 00:07:43,875
[laughs] That's so you.

117
00:07:43,958 --> 00:07:48,458
[HARUKA] Anyway.
You swam freestyle today.

118
00:07:48,541 --> 00:07:54,833
Yeah. I started thinking that
maybe I ought to give it a try.

119
00:07:54,916 --> 00:07:58,083
I mean, we lost the medley
at the tournament,

120
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:01,625
but your freestyle
was so incredible.

121
00:08:01,708 --> 00:08:05,583
You passed those guys
like it was nothing.

122
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,916
Haru.

123
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,000
All I want is to learn
how to swim like you do!

124
00:08:13,291 --> 00:08:15,958
Well, thanks, but,
just copying my form

125
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,708
won't be enough.

126
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:20,916
The point of swimming freestyle
is to do it your way.

127
00:08:22,708 --> 00:08:25,125
I know that. But still.

128
00:08:25,208 --> 00:08:27,291
I'll work hard and
improve my speed.

129
00:08:27,375 --> 00:08:28,583
So, um!

130
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,500
Please, Haru.

131
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,666
Promise me we'll race
freestyle someday!

132
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,250
Sure.

133
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,458
[IKUYA gasps]

134
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,166
[HARUKA]
It's happening.

135
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,041
So, what did you wish for?

136
00:09:01,416 --> 00:09:02,791
[IKUYA]
It's a secret.

137
00:09:06,541 --> 00:09:07,625
[ASAHI]
Well?

138
00:09:07,708 --> 00:09:09,000
[HARUKA]
He's not here.

139
00:09:09,083 --> 00:09:11,458
[ASAHI sighs]
Maybe we had the wrong guy.

140
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:14,791
No. I know that was Ikuya.

141
00:09:16,083 --> 00:09:19,750
Haru and Asahi should've
been back by now.

142
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,166
I wonder if something's wrong.

143
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:22,958
[phone buzzes]

144
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,500
[KISUMI]
What's up?

145
00:09:24,583 --> 00:09:26,458
Dunno. It's from Nagisa.

146
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,375
[MAKOTO] Apparently,
Ikuya's still swimming!

147
00:09:30,458 --> 00:09:33,750
Nagisa thinks he might even
be at this tournament!

148
00:09:33,833 --> 00:09:36,625
[gasps] Ikuya's here?

149
00:09:36,708 --> 00:09:37,916
[NAGISA]
I wonder if Haru and Mako

150
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,833
got to see their old friend.

151
00:09:39,916 --> 00:09:42,708
Sorry, is Haru the guy
who was all dressed up

152
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:45,708
and riding a camel in the
recruiting video we saw?

153
00:09:45,791 --> 00:09:47,291
[NAGISA laughs]
That's him!

154
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:50,375
The mysterious peddler
on his trusty camel, Chappy!

155
00:09:50,458 --> 00:09:51,791
[SHIZURU]
Wow!

156
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:55,291
And now he's working hard
at a college in Tokyo.

157
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:58,458
He's in Tokyo? Wow,
that's so awesome!

158
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,375
Oh, that's right,
Romio, you transferred

159
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,791
from Tokyo, didn't you?

160
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:02,916
Uh-huh!

161
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,916
Well, I was actually
born in New York,

162
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,791
but my second home is Tokyo!

163
00:10:06,875 --> 00:10:09,333
So when are we gonna get
to ride Chappy the camel?

164
00:10:09,416 --> 00:10:10,666
Easy there.

165
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,333
Chappy's a worthy goal,
but the summer tournament

166
00:10:12,416 --> 00:10:13,583
has to come first.

167
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:15,291
Oh, yeah, speaking of Tokyo--

168
00:10:15,375 --> 00:10:17,208
that's where the nationals
are being held this year,

169
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,458
so if we make it there,

170
00:10:18,541 --> 00:10:20,500
you'll get to meet
Haru and Mako yourselves!

171
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:22,000
But wait a sec.

172
00:10:22,083 --> 00:10:24,083
If you guys get to compete
at the All-Japan Invitational,

173
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:25,791
wouldn't that mean you'll
have an opportunity

174
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:28,083
to swim with Haruka again there?

175
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:29,916
Hold on, we can swim at that?

176
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,916
[AYUMU]
Yes. There's no age restriction,

177
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,125
so even high school
students can compete.

178
00:10:34,208 --> 00:10:36,125
If you want to go,
all you have to do is beat

179
00:10:36,208 --> 00:10:39,541
a certain qualifying time, and
you're automatically eligible.

180
00:10:41,041 --> 00:10:44,041
I see. Well, you know,
it's a lofty dream,

181
00:10:44,125 --> 00:10:46,333
but every little step
gets us closer!

182
00:10:46,416 --> 00:10:49,625
We can start by knocking out
our special practice regimen!

183
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:52,958
Let's give it our all,
Iwatobi Swim Club!

184
00:10:53,041 --> 00:10:55,375
[IWATOBI SWIM CLUB]
Yeah!

185
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:59,125
[MAKOTO] Let's see here.
Where's Ikuya's name?

186
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,458
[gasps]

187
00:11:00,541 --> 00:11:03,875
[MAKOTO] There! It's under
Shimogami University.

188
00:11:03,958 --> 00:11:06,875
According to the program,
he's only gonna do the IM.

189
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,000
"IM"?

190
00:11:08,083 --> 00:11:09,958
It means "Individual Medley."

191
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,750
So he's not swimming
relays anymore.

192
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:14,416
But he's at Shimogami.

193
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,833
I hear they're a really
strong sports school.

194
00:11:16,916 --> 00:11:18,000
[AZUMA]
Shimo U is home

195
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:21,250
to a slew of uniquely
talented athletes.

196
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:24,291
Hah. That's their section there.

197
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,375
Watch out for those guys.

198
00:11:29,083 --> 00:11:31,208
[SAGAE]
Whoa. A new record.

199
00:11:31,291 --> 00:11:33,583
Plenty of strong
competitors this year, huh?

200
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,000
Heh. You seem glad.

201
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:36,208
Sure!

202
00:11:36,291 --> 00:11:38,041
It's always exciting
to watch a fast swimmer.

203
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:39,625
Right, Kirishima?

204
00:11:39,708 --> 00:11:42,416
Who cares? I focus on me.

205
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,916
There's no reason to compare
myself to anybody else.

206
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,791
I'm gonna go get ready.

207
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,125
[HIYORI]
Good luck!

208
00:11:50,458 --> 00:11:52,875
Why is that guy
always so standoffish?

209
00:11:52,958 --> 00:11:54,750
[MAKOTO]
Um, excuse me.

210
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:57,291
Is there an Ikuya
Kirishima here with you?

211
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:59,041
Sorry, who are you people?

212
00:11:59,125 --> 00:12:01,666
We are some of Ikuya's old
buddies from middle school.

213
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:03,833
Oh, you were that
super-fast kid!

214
00:12:03,916 --> 00:12:05,791
Who swam the 100-meter free!

215
00:12:05,875 --> 00:12:08,916
[TERASHIMA] Haruka Nanase
from Iwatobi, right?

216
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
--Yeah.
--[ASAHI] Hey, I know you!

217
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:13,541
You're Kotarou Terashima, right?

218
00:12:13,625 --> 00:12:14,625
Wha...?

219
00:12:14,708 --> 00:12:18,000
[ASAHI]
AKA, the Archerfish of Naruto!

220
00:12:18,083 --> 00:12:19,750
Why is he an "Archerfish"?

221
00:12:19,833 --> 00:12:21,791
Don't you ever
call me that again!

222
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:22,833
[yelps]

223
00:12:22,916 --> 00:12:24,041
Asahi!

224
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,625
[SAGAE laughs]
Well, that may be his alias,

225
00:12:26,708 --> 00:12:29,250
but you shouldn't
say it to his face.

226
00:12:29,333 --> 00:12:31,916
You should be happy that
you even have an alias!

227
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,291
I decided to start
calling myself

228
00:12:33,375 --> 00:12:34,791
"The Marlin of Genkainada,"

229
00:12:34,875 --> 00:12:36,458
but it didn't stick,
and now I'm the only person

230
00:12:36,541 --> 00:12:37,708
who ever uses it!

231
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:39,541
Ugh, what a loser.

232
00:12:39,625 --> 00:12:41,041
What'd you say?

233
00:12:41,125 --> 00:12:42,083
There's nothing lamer

234
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:43,916
than giving yourself
an alias, nerd.

235
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,208
Just let it go, Asahi--

236
00:12:45,291 --> 00:12:47,500
we didn't come here
to pick a fight!

237
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,833
So, is Ikuya with you or not?

238
00:12:49,916 --> 00:12:51,666
[HIYORI]
Obviously, he's not.

239
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,666
Don't see him anywhere, do you?

240
00:12:54,708 --> 00:12:57,625
Anyway, the next race is
getting ready to start.

241
00:12:57,708 --> 00:12:59,500
I suggest you go back
to your own seats,

242
00:12:59,583 --> 00:13:01,291
so you can cheer them on.

243
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:07,458
[ASAHI]
Wow, Haru's unbelievable!

244
00:13:07,541 --> 00:13:08,541
[gasps]

245
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,750
[ASAHI] He beat his personal
record time again!

246
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,708
[IKUYA] Right. I need
to get stronger, too.

247
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:22,541
It looks like Ikuya's
working extra hard today.

248
00:13:22,625 --> 00:13:24,083
Yeah.

249
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,458
[NATSUYA] All right, practice
is over! Time to cool down!

250
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:28,625
Hey. We're all done for the day.

251

You okay?

253
00:13:32,875 --> 00:13:35,458
I'm fine. Just gonna
swim a bit more.

254
00:13:35,541 --> 00:13:36,916
[ASAHI]
Uh, wait a sec!

255
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:37,875
[GUY 2A]
Good practice.

256
00:13:37,958 --> 00:13:39,291
[GIRL 2A]
Yeah, you, too!

257
00:13:42,958 --> 00:13:48,791
[IKUYA] Stronger. I have to
become as strong as I can!

258
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:50,666
Just like Haru.

[IKUYA]
I feel so... heavy.

Oh, thank goodness!

266
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,041
You almost drowned.

267
00:14:26,125 --> 00:14:28,000
So we brought you
to the hospital.

268
00:14:28,083 --> 00:14:30,875
Haru dove in and saved you
in the nick of time!

Sorry.

00:14:34,541 --> 00:14:35,666
[NATSUYA]
Look. This all happened

272
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,166
because you pushed
yourself too hard

273
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,291
and didn't take any breaks!

274
00:14:39,375 --> 00:14:40,583
You're lucky to be alive.

275

A few more seconds
and you could've died!

have to be so hard on him.

277
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:50,291
No, it's okay.
Thank you for saving me.

278
00:14:50,375 --> 00:14:53,416
Sure thing. I'm glad
you're all right.

here a while just to be safe.

280

Don't you ever do
something like that again!

281

[IKUYA]
I'm sorry.

282
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:06,083
You guys missed out on
practice because of me.

283

[HARUKA]
It's fine.

284
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:10,375
[IKUYA] But that was our last
chance to swim this year.

285
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:12,291
Just means we'll have
to put our goals on hold

286
00:15:12,375 --> 00:15:14,958
till next summer, that's all.

287
00:15:15,041 --> 00:15:17,500
Till next summer, huh?

288
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:20,125
I swear. I'll get
stronger by then.

289
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:23,666
For the team, and for myself.

290
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:27,125
I'll even be good enough
to compete against you.

[IKUYA] Promise me something.
That next summer

294
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:38,875
you'll race me freestyle.

[HARUKA]
Okay. You got it.

296
00:15:51,458 --> 00:15:53,541
What's with that glasses
guy from Shimo U?

297
00:15:53,625 --> 00:15:55,791
Why's he gotta act
like such a jerk?

298
00:15:55,875 --> 00:15:57,750
And still no Ikuya, either.

That's Haru's freestyle.

315
00:16:45,791 --> 00:16:48,166
His strokes do seem
to have a similar rhythm,

316
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:51,708
but still. It's not just a copy.

317
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:53,500
[gasps]

318
00:16:53,583 --> 00:16:55,208
[KISUMI]
What changed?

319
00:16:55,291 --> 00:16:56,583
I thought back in middle school,

320
00:16:56,666 --> 00:16:58,916
Ikuya used to swim breaststroke
more than anything.

321
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:01,291
Yeah. That was his specialty.

322
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:02,750
During our first summer,

323
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,291
he told me he wanted
to get better at free.

324
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:06,875
Not just freestyle.

325
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:10,291
It looks like he's also mastered
the backstroke and butterfly.

326
00:17:10,375 --> 00:17:13,750
[AZUMA] Hey. Why do you
only swim freestyle?

327
00:17:13,833 --> 00:17:15,208
Huh? This guy?

328
00:17:15,291 --> 00:17:18,125
[AZUMA] What's wrong?
S'that all you wanna do?

329
00:17:18,208 --> 00:17:19,541
[HARUKA]
Uh--

330
00:17:19,625 --> 00:17:22,208
[AZUMA] Well, I'll let
you give it some thought.

331
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,500
Okay that was weird.
What's his deal?

332
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:25,666
No clue.

333
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:28,000
Maybe he's a scout
or a coach or something.

334
00:17:28,083 --> 00:17:30,750
I guess that could be it.

335
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,875
Crap! We forgot about Ikuya!

336
00:17:34,458 --> 00:17:35,208
[MAKOTO]
Locker room?

337
00:17:35,291 --> 00:17:36,750
[ASAHI]
Yeah, this way!

338
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,083
No luck.

339
00:17:41,166 --> 00:17:43,291
Well, his race hasn't
been over that long.

340
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:46,166
Maybe we should wait in
here for a few minutes?

341
00:17:46,250 --> 00:17:49,250
[KISUMI] Now we're getting
into stalker territory, guys.

342
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:56,416
There you are.

343
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:58,708
Hey.

344
00:17:58,791 --> 00:18:00,833
'Bout ready to take off?

345
00:18:00,916 --> 00:18:02,291
What's the big hurry?

346
00:18:02,375 --> 00:18:05,083
Relax, the tournament's
not even over yet.

347
00:18:05,166 --> 00:18:08,000
Our school races are the
only ones that matter, right?

348
00:18:08,083 --> 00:18:10,583
Here. I brought all
your stuff for ya.

349
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,041
Yeah, I dunno.

350
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,541
We should ditch this place
and go get somethin' to eat.

351
00:18:14,625 --> 00:18:16,083
Come on, I'll let
everybody else know

352
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:17,708
that we're leavin' early.

353
00:18:17,791 --> 00:18:19,208
[IKUYA]
Uh...

354
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,833
[IKUYA]
So, your 200-meter backstroke.

355
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,333
It was faster today.

356
00:18:24,416 --> 00:18:26,916
Yeah, but it's nowhere
near as fast as yours.

357
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:28,625
Seriously, you did
some amazing work

358
00:18:28,708 --> 00:18:30,083
out there today, Ikuya!

359
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:33,125
You should let Natsuya know
the first chance you get.

360
00:18:33,208 --> 00:18:37,000
He's in another time zone.
It's not like it's urgent news.

361
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:40,875
Sure, sure. Hey, why don't
you order this cake!

362
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,708
It's got pistachio cream,
your favorite.

363
00:18:43,791 --> 00:18:46,250
Maybe I'll get one, too.

364
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:50,083
Uh, Hiyori. You're
acting kind of weird.

365
00:18:50,166 --> 00:18:53,541
Oh, come on, I'm always
weird, you know that!

366
00:18:53,625 --> 00:18:57,250
[MAKOTO sighs]
We didn't even get to say hi.

367
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,791
[KISUMI] He's not avoiding
us on purpose, is he?

368
00:18:59,875 --> 00:19:01,666
[laughs] No way!

369
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:03,708
Well, I would've liked to
catch up with him, too,

370
00:19:03,791 --> 00:19:05,375
but at least we found out
that he's still swimming.

371
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:06,125
I mean, that's enough for--

372
00:19:06,208 --> 00:19:07,500
[yelps]

373
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:08,541
[KISUMI]
Are you all right?

374
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:10,083
[MAKOTO]
Sorry, I only have tissues.

375
00:19:10,166 --> 00:19:14,166
[ASAHI] Oh, thanks.
Ugh, now I'm all sticky.

376
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:16,125
[HARUKA] I think I left
my towel at the venue.

377
00:19:16,208 --> 00:19:17,041
[MAKOTO, ASAHI]
Huh?

378
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:18,375
[HARUKA]
I'll go get it.

379
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,250
[MAKOTO] 'Kay. We'll wait
for you at the station!

380
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:21,458
Cool.

381
00:19:24,083 --> 00:19:25,958
[HIYORI]
Somethin' wrong?

382
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:28,625
[IKUYA] I think I left
my phone at that café.

383
00:19:28,708 --> 00:19:30,000
Then let's go back.

384
00:19:30,083 --> 00:19:32,416
[IKUYA]
No. I can go by myself.

385
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,708
See ya tomorrow.

386
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:38,333
[HIYORI]
Forgot your phone, huh?

387
00:19:38,416 --> 00:19:40,166
That's not all you've forgotten.

388
00:19:55,416 --> 00:19:56,666
[gasps]

389
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,416
Ikuya.

390
00:20:10,583 --> 00:20:11,708
Haru.

391
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,291
[HARUKA]
I saw your individual medley.

392
00:20:15,375 --> 00:20:17,041
[IKUYA]
Oh, you were there?

393
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:20,416
I didn't see you swim any races.

394
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,416
Why did you only
compete in the IM?

395
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:28,375
Do you not do relays anymore?

396
00:20:28,458 --> 00:20:30,916
[IKUYA]
What for?

397
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:32,916
I'm fine swimming alone.

398
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,083
[gasps]

399
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:38,875
[HARUKA]
Back in middle school...

400
00:20:38,958 --> 00:20:41,333
When I quit out of nowhere...

401
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:45,333
I shouldn't have.
I'm sorry, I just--

402
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,833
[IKUYA]
Forget about that.

403
00:20:46,916 --> 00:20:50,125
It doesn't bother me now.
It's all in the past.

404
00:20:50,208 --> 00:20:51,458
"All in the past"?

405
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:53,875
[HIYORI]
Hey, there you are!

406
00:20:53,958 --> 00:20:55,125
Hiyori?

407
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:57,500
I'm okay, you could've
gone home without me.

408
00:20:57,583 --> 00:20:59,000
Yeah, sorry, I know.

409
00:20:59,083 --> 00:21:02,458
I just had a little
spark of curiosity.

410
00:21:02,541 --> 00:21:03,666
Nanase, was it?

411
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,916
Ikuya's pretty exhausted
from his big race,

412
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,625
so I'd prefer you didn't
keep him too long, okay?

413
00:21:08,708 --> 00:21:09,916
Come on. Let's go.

414
00:21:12,083 --> 00:21:13,291
Wait a sec--

415
00:21:19,375 --> 00:21:20,666
[ASAHI]
No way!

416
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:23,166
Maybe that means
he really is angry!

417
00:21:23,250 --> 00:21:25,041
[sighs] You know,
when I moved away,

418
00:21:25,125 --> 00:21:26,958
I also had to quit the
team without warning,

419
00:21:27,041 --> 00:21:29,041
so I guess I can't
really blame him.

420
00:21:29,125 --> 00:21:31,416
I prob'ly owe him
an apology, too.

421
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,375
Well, at least we know
where to find him now.

422
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,625
Why don't we all go visit
him together sometime?

423
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:39,541
That way, you can tell him
what's on your mind.

424
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:42,500
[ASAHI]
Good thinkin'. Let's do that.

425
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:47,541
[NATSUYA] Hey, Ikuya! How was
the newcomer tournament?

426
00:21:47,625 --> 00:21:50,916
Uneventful. I'm surprised
you're awake.

427
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,333
[NATSUYA]
Why wouldn't I be?

428
00:21:52,416 --> 00:21:54,375
It's evening where I am, too.

429
00:21:54,458 --> 00:21:56,208
Oh, and I guess I did
get a little bit of sleep

430
00:21:56,291 --> 00:21:57,208
during the flight.

431
00:21:57,291 --> 00:21:59,958
[IKUYA]
Hm? You're not in America?

432
00:22:00,041 --> 00:22:01,958
[NATSUYA] Nah, I heard about
this interesting coach,

433
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:04,416
so I flew out to meet him.

434
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,916
I'm in Sydney.

435
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,750
Just landed a minute ago.

436
00:22:10,958 --> 00:22:12,208
[NAGISA]
Wonder how Rin's doing?

437
00:22:12,291 --> 00:22:14,000
[REI] The lives of two men
with complex thoughts

438
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:15,500
and feelings are about to cross!

439
00:22:15,583 --> 00:22:17,958
[NAGISA] Next time:
"Fist Swim in Another Country!"

440
00:22:18,041 --> 00:22:19,291
[REI]
Don't miss this one!
