for the individual medley.

161
00:08:38,383 --> 00:08:39,676
Thank you!

162
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:42,637
Do you want me to
show you how to order?

163
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,181
[STAFF 9A]
Okay.

164
00:08:45,265 --> 00:08:47,517
Two miso-braised
mackerel sets, right?

165
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,269
I'll get it started for you.

166
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,856
She tore it up.

167
00:08:52,939 --> 00:08:54,899
She's supposed to.

168
00:08:55,984 --> 00:09:00,739
[STAFF 9A] All right, here
we are. Enjoy your meal!

169
00:09:00,822 --> 00:09:02,115
I get it.

170
00:09:02,198 --> 00:09:03,575
[HARUKA]
Let's eat.

171
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:17,964
Ah--

172
00:09:18,048 --> 00:09:19,507
[HARUKA]
Just a second.

173
00:09:30,310 --> 00:09:31,853
Impressive.

174
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,148
{\an8}<i>Utsokt</i> !

175
00:09:38,902 --> 00:09:40,278
Glad you like it.

176
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,200
[RALPH]
Albert.

177
00:09:45,283 --> 00:09:47,202
Hey, Ralph. You okay?

178
00:09:47,285 --> 00:09:48,495
Of course not!

179
00:09:48,578 --> 00:09:51,247
You're always
disappearing on me!

180
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,749
Let's go.

181
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:56,711
<i>Vi ses</i> . See ya later.

182
00:09:56,795 --> 00:09:58,171
See ya.

183
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:01,341
[ISUZU sighs]
Jeez, bro,

184
00:10:01,424 --> 00:10:04,094
I thought that race
was gonna kill me!

185
00:10:06,471 --> 00:10:08,390
[ISUZU]
The guy from the arcade?

186
00:10:08,473 --> 00:10:11,184
What's he doing here?

187
00:10:11,267 --> 00:10:13,061
Hang on.

188
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:15,146
Now I know where
I've seen him.

189
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,155
[NAGISA]
It's finally time!

190
00:10:24,239 --> 00:10:26,241
I can't believe regionals
really start tomorrow!

191
00:10:26,324 --> 00:10:27,283
Uh-huh!

192
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:28,827
And the best part is
we all get to do

193
00:10:28,910 --> 00:10:32,455
the medley relay together!
I'm super excited!

194
00:10:32,539 --> 00:10:34,082
It's gonna be fun!

195
00:10:34,165 --> 00:10:36,584
Your exchanges have gotten
much better lately.

196
00:10:36,668 --> 00:10:38,837
That's all thanks
to the captain here!

197
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:39,879
Oh, no.

198
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:41,464
It's because you've
worked so hard.

199
00:10:41,548 --> 00:10:43,341
Speaking of which,
while Nagisa and I

200
00:10:43,425 --> 00:10:45,552
may have won in our
individual events,

201
00:10:45,635 --> 00:10:49,180
it was only because we had the
support of you and Shizuru.

202
00:10:49,264 --> 00:10:50,974
And we can't forget about
the assistance from

203
00:10:51,057 --> 00:10:53,476
our wonderful managers,
Gou and Ayumu.

204
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,353
Iwatobi Swim Club
could never have gotten

205
00:10:55,437 --> 00:10:57,063
this far without you.

206
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,065
And Rei and I are
third-years now,

207
00:10:59,149 --> 00:11:01,401
so this is our last summer here.

208
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:05,655
Feels like just yesterday
you invited me to join the club.

209
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:07,824
Time really does fly,
doesn't it?

210
00:11:07,907 --> 00:11:09,492
[NAGISA]
Mm!

211
00:11:09,576 --> 00:11:12,579
[REI] But, we haven't reached
the end of our journey yet!

212
00:11:12,662 --> 00:11:15,957
Don't forget, we still
have nationals!

213
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,585
With all our friends in Tokyo!

214
00:11:18,668 --> 00:11:21,129
Regionals are just a
checkpoint along the way.

215
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,132
We're aiming for
something far greater!

216
00:11:24,215 --> 00:11:26,426
After all, Haruka and the
others are working hard

217
00:11:26,509 --> 00:11:29,095
to make it to the world
stage, aren't they?

218
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:30,263
World stage?

219
00:11:30,347 --> 00:11:31,765
Correct!

220
00:11:31,848 --> 00:11:34,392
Our bodies and minds haven't
finished evolving quite yet.

221
00:11:34,476 --> 00:11:36,603
We have the potential to
reach beyond the nationals

222
00:11:36,686 --> 00:11:39,856
and go all the way to the top!

223
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,983
This from the guy who
said "it took millions

224
00:11:42,067 --> 00:11:43,777
of years for life to
crawl from the oceans--

225
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,403
why go back to the water?"

226
00:11:45,487 --> 00:11:48,156
[laughs] You've evolved
more than anybody.

227
00:11:48,239 --> 00:11:49,282
[laughs]

228
00:11:49,366 --> 00:11:50,867
Um, actually.

229
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,495
I really want to go
to nationals, too!

230
00:11:53,578 --> 00:11:55,747
I'm ready to go back to Tokyo.

231
00:11:55,830 --> 00:11:57,332
So that my second
home can see me

232
00:11:57,415 --> 00:11:58,625
now that I'm "new and improved!"

233
00:11:58,708 --> 00:12:01,544
And I could go for some
of that Tokyo seafood.

234
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:03,046
Like seaweed side-dishes.

235
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,547
[AYUMU]
Sounds good!

236
00:12:04,631 --> 00:12:07,258
[NAGISA laughs] And there's tons
of food I wanna try, too!

237
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:10,178
Like a concrete jungle parfait!

238
00:12:10,261 --> 00:12:12,138
[REI]
Dreams...

239
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:15,016
I wonder where I'll be
this time next year,

240
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,559
and where I'll be headed.

241
00:12:16,643 --> 00:12:18,812
[GOU] You guys do know we're
not going for the food, right?

242
00:12:22,691 --> 00:12:23,817
[TSUKUSHI coos]

243
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,235
Whoa there.

244
00:12:27,070 --> 00:12:28,822
Aw, he's adorable.

245
00:12:28,905 --> 00:12:31,491
I always wished I had a younger
brother when I was growing up.

246
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:34,119
[AKANE] Yeah? Well, then,
you're welcome to take mine.

247
00:12:34,202 --> 00:12:35,578
He's all yours.

248
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:37,580
[ASAHI]
Mm?

249
00:12:37,664 --> 00:12:39,165
Hey, what's that face for?

250
00:12:39,249 --> 00:12:40,000
Nothing.

251
00:12:40,083 --> 00:12:41,167
Huh?

252
00:12:41,251 --> 00:12:43,378
[AKANE]
Nice work today, guys!

253
00:12:43,461 --> 00:12:45,005
Aw, yeah!

254
00:12:45,088 --> 00:12:47,340
Especially Ikuya.

255
00:12:47,424 --> 00:12:49,634
You beat the qualifying
time for 100-meter free

256
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:51,302
and 100-meter breaststroke!

257
00:12:51,386 --> 00:12:52,429
Cheers!

258
00:12:52,512 --> 00:12:54,514
[ASAHI, HIYORI, IKUYA]
Cheers!

259
00:12:54,597 --> 00:12:56,099
Thanks, everybody.

260
00:12:56,182 --> 00:12:58,018
You were great, too, Asahi.

261
00:12:58,101 --> 00:13:00,353
Yeah, I mean, I know I lost
and all, but I'm still

262
00:13:00,437 --> 00:13:02,105
really happy that you
finally got the chance

263
00:13:02,188 --> 00:13:04,649
to swim freestyle your own way.

264
00:13:04,733 --> 00:13:05,692
Yeah.

265
00:13:05,775 --> 00:13:06,943
[ASAHI]
But!

266
00:13:07,027 --> 00:13:10,071
You're gonna eat my dust
next time, so get ready!

267
00:13:10,155 --> 00:13:11,531
That takes me back.

268
00:13:11,614 --> 00:13:13,074
You said that in seventh grade.

269
00:13:13,158 --> 00:13:14,409
[ASAHI]
Shut up!

270
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:15,785
But you did beat
the qualifying time

271
00:13:15,869 --> 00:13:17,412
in the 200-meter butterfly--

272
00:13:17,495 --> 00:13:19,289
that's really
impressive, too, Asahi!

273
00:13:19,372 --> 00:13:22,000
That's because "Butterfly"
is my middle name!

274
00:13:22,083 --> 00:13:25,420
[MAKOTO] Natsuya swam, too,
didn't he? In the IM?

275
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:26,921
He did.

276
00:13:27,005 --> 00:13:29,424
And he ended up beating the
qualifying time, apparently.

277
00:13:29,507 --> 00:13:30,675
[ASAHI]
Oh, sweet!

278
00:13:30,759 --> 00:13:32,927
Yeah, which means he's
gonna be my rival now.

279
00:13:33,011 --> 00:13:34,929
That makes it
brother-versus-brother!

280
00:13:35,013 --> 00:13:36,181
Badass!

281
00:13:36,264 --> 00:13:39,684
[KISUMI]
Hey! Sorry I'm late!

282
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:41,853
So, how did your
big race turn out?

283
00:13:41,936 --> 00:13:44,397
He got his butt kicked
by Ikuya in freestyle.

284
00:13:44,481 --> 00:13:46,107
[ASAHI]
He wasn't talking to you!

285
00:13:46,191 --> 00:13:47,650
So you're both going
to the All-Japan

286
00:13:47,734 --> 00:13:50,737
for the 50-meter free,
and Ikuya for 100 meter.

287
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,115
Then there's Haru,
for the one and 200.

288
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,077
Makoto, have you heard
from Rin at all?

289
00:13:57,160 --> 00:13:58,536
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, the other day.

290
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,830
He said he qualified
in 100-meter butterfly

291
00:14:00,914 --> 00:14:02,374
and 100-meter freestyle.

292
00:14:02,457 --> 00:14:05,502
[KISUMI] Hundred-meter
free'll be crowded!

293
00:14:05,585 --> 00:14:08,004
Wait, hang on a sec,
you mean Rin Matsuoka,

294
00:14:08,088 --> 00:14:09,172
the one you and Haru swam with

295
00:14:09,255 --> 00:14:10,674
when you were in
elementary? That guy?

296
00:14:10,757 --> 00:14:12,175
Yep!

297
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:14,386
Haru and I swam in our first
medley relay ever with Rin,

298
00:14:14,469 --> 00:14:16,638
and another friend, Nagisa.

299
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:18,390
Rin Matsuoka.

300
00:14:18,473 --> 00:14:21,393
Oh, yeah, he went to high school
at Samezuka Academy, didn't he?

301
00:14:21,476 --> 00:14:23,770
Right. After that,
he moved to Australia,

302
00:14:23,853 --> 00:14:25,605
and now he's going to
college there and swimming

303
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:27,649
with a club team in Sydney.

304
00:14:27,732 --> 00:14:30,652
[KISUMI] Rin and Haru are
the perfect rivals.

305
00:14:30,735 --> 00:14:32,821
Oh, yeah, I heard they
were having friendly races

306
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,447
today at Haru's training camp.

307
00:14:34,531 --> 00:14:36,408
Think you'll go watch
and cheer him on?

308
00:14:36,491 --> 00:14:37,409
Yeah!

309
00:14:37,492 --> 00:14:39,035
I'm heading over
there after work.

310
00:14:39,119 --> 00:14:41,037
That's kind of a hike, isn't it?

311
00:14:41,121 --> 00:14:43,498
Maybe. But it's fine.

312
00:14:43,581 --> 00:14:45,625
Sure he'll do great either way.

313
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:49,129
[ACTRESS 9A]
I'm not good enough.

314
00:14:49,212 --> 00:14:52,298
You should try to find
happiness with someone else!

315
00:14:52,382 --> 00:14:54,300
But they were made
for each other!

316
00:14:54,384 --> 00:14:55,760
They'll get back together soon.

317
00:14:55,844 --> 00:14:57,929
Women are such fickle creatures.

318
