Haru.

3
00:00:24,139 --> 00:00:25,682
That was a great swim.

4
00:00:25,765 --> 00:00:28,101
Nah, it was nothing special.

5
00:00:28,184 --> 00:00:29,436
Hold on, isn't that...?

6
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:30,353
Yup.

7
00:00:30,437 --> 00:00:32,355
Albert Wahlander from Sweden.

8
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:33,815
He holds the current
world record

9
00:00:33,898 --> 00:00:37,569
for the 100 and
200-meter freestyle.

10
00:00:37,652 --> 00:00:39,195
That's crazy.

[ISUZU]
Makoto Tachibana, right?

12
00:00:41,281 --> 00:00:43,992
Isuzu Mikoshiba, Hidaka
High School Swim Team.

13
00:00:44,075 --> 00:00:45,535
I'm the captain, actually!

You've swum against my brothers!

Wait, you mean like

17
00:00:51,541 --> 00:00:52,292
[ISUZU]
Yeah!

18
00:00:52,375 --> 00:00:53,918
Wow, small world!

[gasps]

20
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:57,672
Were you watching? How was Haru?

21
00:00:57,756 --> 00:01:00,175
Well, his form seemed
to be pretty decent.

22
00:01:00,258 --> 00:01:02,052
But it's not like they
call Albert Wahlander

23
00:01:02,135 --> 00:01:05,347
the Odin of the swimming
world for nothing, you know.

24
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:08,683
[MAKOTO] Odin? As in the
Norse god of battle and death?

25
00:01:08,767 --> 00:01:11,686
[ISUZU] Right. Rumor has it,
anyone who swims with him

26
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:14,356
feels their mind
being torn apart.

27
00:01:17,609 --> 00:01:19,444
Could everyone except
staff and participants

28
00:01:19,527 --> 00:01:21,363
please clear out
of the venue now?

29

Oh, Rin. You're here. Hey.

33
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:16,561
Hey. What's up?

34
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:18,938
[RIN]
It's been a while.

35
00:03:19,022 --> 00:03:20,273
[SOSUKE]
Yeah.

36
00:03:20,357 --> 00:03:21,900
When did you get
back from Sydney?

[RIN]
Eh, not long ago.

38
00:03:23,651 --> 00:03:26,029
Couldn't miss out
on the All-Japan.

39
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:27,697
[SOSUKE]
Sounds like fun.

40
00:03:28,698 --> 00:03:31,534
[RIN] Oh, by the way,
I brought a souvenir for ya.

Okay...?

42
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:36,331
I thought somethin' soft
and cute would help

scary face of yours.

44
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,418
[SOSUKE]
Gee, thanks, very funny.

45
00:03:40,502 --> 00:03:42,921
And I expect you to wear it.

46
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:45,674
Oh, hey, I stopped by Samezuka.

47
00:03:45,757 --> 00:03:48,510
Ai and Momo are gonna
swim in the regionals.

48
00:03:48,593 --> 00:03:49,552
[SOSUKE]
That's great.

49
00:03:49,636 --> 00:03:51,554
Those two have
worked really hard.

50
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:54,557
Plus, my coach Mikhail
is related to Ai.

51
00:03:54,641 --> 00:03:56,309
How's that for a twist, right?

52
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:57,477
You're kidding.

53
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,355
[RIN] Nope. Life's
funny sometimes, huh?

54
00:04:00,438 --> 00:04:01,940
That's for sure.

55
00:04:03,858 --> 00:04:06,111
[RIN]
So, anyway.

56
00:04:06,194 --> 00:04:09,864
Listen. I, uh...

You wanna know about my surgery?

Don't cry.

00:04:48,445 --> 00:04:50,155
I'm not crying!

00:04:52,198 --> 00:04:55,285
Feels like I'm finally on
the starting block now.

66
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:58,580
Keep taking on the world
while I catch up, okay?

00:05:01,166 --> 00:05:02,959
Don't get all sappy.

00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:05,045
There's no time to wait around.

69
00:05:05,128 --> 00:05:08,965
I gotta keep movin' forward,
far beyond the horizon.

70
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:10,633
Ever the poet.

71
00:05:10,717 --> 00:05:12,886
It fits, though,
don't you think?

72
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,017
[MAKOTO]
Still no answer.

73
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:20,935
Whoa. What's going on with him?

74
00:05:21,019 --> 00:05:23,605
He lost his friendly
the other day so,

75
00:05:23,688 --> 00:05:25,565
he's prob'ly kinda bummed.

76
00:05:25,648 --> 00:05:27,067
Could be.

77
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:29,736
Maybe he just needs a little
time to process it all.

78
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:35,700
[MAKOTO] If you're done
with your ten laps,

79
00:05:35,784 --> 00:05:38,119
it's time for a break!

How are you feeling, Misaki?

00:05:39,996 --> 00:05:41,539
Great! I'm a lot better now!

00:05:41,623 --> 00:05:43,917
And thank you again for your
help the other day, Coach.

83
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,127
I'm sorry I didn't
notice it sooner.

84
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:48,546
Just try not to
overexert yourself.

85
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,590
[MISAKI]
'Kay!

86
00:05:50,674 --> 00:05:51,424
Hey, there.

00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,468
Oh! Hi, Nao!

88
00:05:53,551 --> 00:05:55,929
[NAO] I heard something that
has me a little worried.

89
00:05:56,012 --> 00:05:58,431
About Haruka.

90
00:05:58,515 --> 00:06:00,141
Guessing it has to do
with the friendly race

91
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,726
at his training camp?

92
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:03,311
[NAO]
Yeah.

93
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:06,314
I didn't get there in time
to watch the whole thing.

94
00:06:06,398 --> 00:06:09,109
All I managed to catch was
Haru coming in second,

95
00:06:09,192 --> 00:06:11,945
and getting beaten by
that Albert Wahlander guy.

96
00:06:12,028 --> 00:06:13,446
I see.

97
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,074
[MAKOTO] I haven't been
able to reach him since.

98
00:06:16,157 --> 00:06:18,535
Apparently, they're all
moving to a higher-elevation

99
00:06:18,618 --> 00:06:21,329
training facility next.

100
00:06:21,413 --> 00:06:24,082
I'm worried he might be dwelling
on the fact that he lost.

101
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:26,334
And I can't help but wonder
if there's something

102
00:06:26,418 --> 00:06:28,795
I can do to help
him overcome that.

103
00:06:29,963 --> 00:06:31,589
I think you might
enjoy the kind of job

104
00:06:31,673 --> 00:06:34,009
where you can support
swimmers one-on-one.

105
00:06:34,092 --> 00:06:35,093
[MAKOTO]
What?

106
00:06:35,176 --> 00:06:36,720
[NAO]
You know, like a trainer, maybe.

107
00:06:36,803 --> 00:06:38,263
Really?

108
00:06:38,346 --> 00:06:39,806
[NAO]
Of course.

109
00:06:39,889 --> 00:06:42,225
Helping them with stretches
and massage to prevent injury.

110
00:06:42,308 --> 00:06:46,521
And mental support to keep them
in the right headspace.

111
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,023
I'm glad I have a
friend who's familiar

112
00:06:48,106 --> 00:06:50,066
with this stuff, or I
wouldn't have been able

113
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,985
to learn so much about it.

114
00:06:52,068 --> 00:06:54,320
Yeah, that's interesting.

115
00:06:54,404 --> 00:06:57,073
[NAO] After what happened
with my eye, sports medicine

116
00:06:57,157 --> 00:06:59,576
seemed like the best thing
for me to focus on.

117
00:06:59,659 --> 00:07:03,038
This way, I can still
engage with swimming.

118
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,998
I'm sure you can find
something that makes use

119
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,499
of your talents, too.

120
00:07:06,583 --> 00:07:07,584
So, tell me--

121
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:10,378
[MISAKI]
Hey, Coach? Can I talk to you?

122
00:07:10,462 --> 00:07:12,297
I'd better get going.

123
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:14,674
Your competition's coming
up soon, isn't it?

124
00:07:14,758 --> 00:07:15,675
Good luck.

125
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,136
Thanks, I'm gonna
give it my best!

126
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,640
[MAKOTO]
What'd you wanna tell me?

127
00:07:22,724 --> 00:07:24,893
Well, it's just that I've
been having a hard time

128
00:07:24,976 --> 00:07:26,436
getting my turns right.

129
00:07:26,519 --> 00:07:28,813
Maybe you're kicking too soon
when you push off the wall,

130
00:07:28,897 --> 00:07:30,523
but let's check.

131
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,567
Give it another try
and I'll watch.

132
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,277
'Kay, I will, sir!

00:07:37,113 --> 00:07:40,116
[MISAKI] Natsume's turns have
always been really smooth.

134
00:07:41,785 --> 00:07:43,620
When you say Natsume,
you're talking about

135
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:45,372
your rival who moved away?

136
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:48,333
Yeah. I'm gonna
work hard, though!

See ya, Coach Tachibana!

[MAKOTO] Sports are
all about competition.

141
00:08:01,012 --> 00:08:03,682
There has to be a
winner and a loser.

142
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:05,392
But up until the moment
when the winner

143
00:08:05,475 --> 00:08:07,352
and the loser are decided,

144
00:08:07,435 --> 00:08:11,064

with everything they've got.

toward becoming a true champion!

Three years isn't really
very long at all.

Making it to nationals in that
amount of time is incredible.

Kinda makes me wonder if
he's possessed or something.

162
00:08:51,896 --> 00:08:52,897
Possessed?!

163
00:08:52,981 --> 00:08:55,942
Yes. By the ghost
of the butterfly!

164
00:08:56,026 --> 00:08:57,819
Seriously though,
a simple "congratulations"

165
00:08:57,902 --> 00:08:59,779
would be sufficient.

166
00:08:59,863 --> 00:09:01,823
[NAGISA] And I'm doing
100-meter breaststroke!

167
00:09:01,906 --> 00:09:04,784
That's so great, Nagisa!
I'll come see!

168
00:09:04,868 --> 00:09:06,745
[NAGISA] From Samezuka,
Ai and Momo made it

169
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:10,165
into the medley, and Ai's
doing 100-meter breast, too!

170
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:11,374
[MAKOTO]
Oh, wow.

171
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,209
So you're gonna have
to compete with Nitori.

172
00:09:13,293 --> 00:09:14,961
[GOU]
Ooh, and guess what else?

173
00:09:15,045 --> 00:09:17,630
My brother's in
Tokyo as we speak!

174
00:09:17,714 --> 00:09:18,506
He's here?

175
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,966
Yes!

176
00:09:20,050 --> 00:09:21,634
You guys should try to meet
up if you have some time!

177
00:09:21,718 --> 00:09:23,094
[MAKOTO]
Cool, thanks for the heads-up.

178
00:09:23,178 --> 00:09:24,512
See ya soon!

179
00:09:24,596 --> 00:09:26,598
So, Rin's already in Tokyo?

180
00:09:26,681 --> 00:09:28,099
He wants to see Sosuke.

181
00:09:28,183 --> 00:09:31,311
Gotcha. We'll see them all soon!

182
00:09:31,394 --> 00:09:35,815
Haru, Mako, Sosuke,
and Rin! N'that Ikuya guy.

183
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,151
And maybe his friend Asahi, too!

184
00:09:38,234 --> 00:09:40,653
You still use nicknames
for Haruka and Makoto?

185
00:09:40,737 --> 00:09:43,698
Sure! They're my
friends, aren't they?

186
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,158
Should I be more formal?

187
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,534
[REI]
"Sir Haruka!"

188
00:09:46,618 --> 00:09:47,952
He sounds like a prince.

189
00:09:48,036 --> 00:09:49,162
[REI]
"Lord Makoto!"

190
00:09:49,245 --> 00:09:50,538
He sounds like a samurai.

191
00:09:50,622 --> 00:09:52,457
Let's just name them
for their muscles!

192
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:56,044
"Beautiful, Killer-muscles,
Cool. BKC Nanase!"

193
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:59,714
Makoto's NKL. "Nice,
Killer-muscles, Lovely!"

194
00:09:59,798 --> 00:10:01,591
[AYUMU] Doesn't quite
roll off the tongue.

195
00:10:01,675 --> 00:10:03,134
Well, I dunno.

196
00:10:03,218 --> 00:10:05,929
"Perfect Killer-muscles
Handsome" was pretty famous.

197
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,514
Famous with who?

198
00:10:07,597 --> 00:10:09,015
My grandpa.

199
00:10:20,276 --> 00:10:22,404
[MAKOTO] It says here, the way
they swim is like a dog

200
00:10:22,487 --> 00:10:24,447
sniffing the ground as it walks.

201
00:10:24,531 --> 00:10:27,283
That's why, here in Japan,
we call them dog sharks.

202
00:10:27,367 --> 00:10:30,662
Wow. He's a cute lookin'
little fella, isn't he?

203
00:10:30,745 --> 00:10:32,664
Yeah, I've been waiting
to show it to you.

204
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:34,332
Man, you're still
as weird as ever.

205
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:36,126
Haru's the exact same way.

206
00:10:36,209 --> 00:10:38,712
You haven't changed
much, either.

207
00:10:38,795 --> 00:10:41,089
It seems like you've
gotten stronger, though.

208
00:10:41,172 --> 00:10:42,173
Yeah.

209
00:10:42,257 --> 00:10:44,217
Goin' abroad made
a real difference.

210
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:49,180
[MAKOTO]
I heard you saw Sosuke?

211
00:10:50,724 --> 00:10:52,058
Yep.

212
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:53,518
His surgery was a success.

213
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:54,978
[gasps]

214
00:10:56,563 --> 00:11:00,316
I'm so glad! Good for him.

215
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:03,153
By the way, back in Sydney,

216
00:11:03,236 --> 00:11:05,989
I met an old teammate of
yours, Natsuya Kirishima.

217
00:11:06,072 --> 00:11:07,949
He said he's been wandering
all over the world

218
00:11:08,033 --> 00:11:09,617
entering competitions.

219
00:11:09,701 --> 00:11:11,745
Nao told me a little
bit about that.

220
00:11:11,828 --> 00:11:13,705
Natsuya's a pretty
cool guy, huh?

221
00:11:13,788 --> 00:11:15,790
Yeah, apparently his little
brother'd been having

222
00:11:15,874 --> 00:11:17,042
some trouble lately.

223
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,877
Right, but Haru
helped him out of it.

224
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,670
They competed in the IM.

225
00:11:20,754 --> 00:11:22,172
Our Haru?

226
00:11:22,255 --> 00:11:24,174
[MAKOTO] Mm-hm! But he
hasn't decided if he wants

227
00:11:24,257 --> 00:11:26,217
to do it again or not.

228
00:11:28,303 --> 00:11:31,181
[RIN] It's free or
nothin' with that guy.

229
00:11:31,264 --> 00:11:33,350
What's goin' on with him
these days, anyway?

230
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:36,061
I haven't been able to reach
him since I got back.

231
00:11:37,145 --> 00:11:38,480
[MAKOTO sighs]

232
00:11:38,563 --> 00:11:39,981
Did somethin' happen?

233
00:11:40,065 --> 00:11:42,734
His training camp
had a friendly race.

234
00:11:42,817 --> 00:11:46,988
He lost to a Swedish guy
named Albert Wahlander.

235
00:11:47,072 --> 00:11:50,241
Listen. You should be
careful of that one.

236
00:11:50,325 --> 00:11:53,328
The boy's talent is inhuman.

237
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:59,042
Haru swam with him... and lost?

238
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:04,005
We gotta go. C'mon.

239
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:04,839
Where?

240
00:12:04,923 --> 00:12:05,882
[RIN]
To see Haru!

241
00:12:05,965 --> 00:12:07,592
Now? You're kidding!

242
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:16,976
[AZUMA]
Ugh.

243
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:19,229
You're only focusing on
the long distances.

244
00:12:19,312 --> 00:12:21,981
Don't forget. Sprint practice
is just as important.

245
00:12:22,065 --> 00:12:23,191
Sorry, Coach.

246
00:12:23,274 --> 00:12:25,068
I guess I'll work on
my sprinting next, then.

247
00:12:25,151 --> 00:12:26,319
You're the one who got yourself

248
00:12:26,403 --> 00:12:29,572
into that friendly race
and then lost, remember?

249
00:12:29,656 --> 00:12:32,826
Don't get all cute with me.
Of course ya lost.

250
00:12:32,909 --> 00:12:35,954
Your body's not ready to face
a world-record-holder.

251
00:12:36,037 --> 00:12:37,706
I'll win next time.

252
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:40,709
You always competitive
to the point of stupidity?

253
00:12:40,792 --> 00:12:42,752
I'm gonna take a quick break.

254
00:12:42,836 --> 00:12:45,338
If there's more to the
lecture, let's hear it.

255
00:12:48,341 --> 00:12:50,885
[AZUMA] You ever heard
the term " <i>shuhari</i> ?"

256
00:12:50,969 --> 00:12:52,012
Don't think so.

257
00:12:52,095 --> 00:12:53,304
It's an old word.

258
00:12:53,388 --> 00:12:55,640
Goes back to
classical disciplines.

259
00:12:55,724 --> 00:12:57,559
" <i>Shu</i> " stands for fundamentals.

260
00:12:57,642 --> 00:13:00,103
The " <i>ha</i> " part means
breaking from tradition.

261
00:13:00,186 --> 00:13:03,106
And the last syllable
" <i>ri</i> " is for transcending.

262
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:07,777
Except your freestyle broke
from tradition first.

263
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:09,696
That's the wrong order.

264
00:13:09,779 --> 00:13:12,323
You need to get back
to fundamentals.

265
00:13:14,492 --> 00:13:15,326
Save it.

266
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:16,953
[AZUMA]
Watch the attitude!

267
00:13:17,037 --> 00:13:17,829
He's here.

268
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,874
Yeah! Still workin' hard, I see.

269
00:13:20,957 --> 00:13:21,708
Hey.

270
00:13:21,791 --> 00:13:22,959
Hello, sir.

271
00:13:23,043 --> 00:13:26,171
You're a long way from
your school. Who's this?

272
00:13:26,254 --> 00:13:27,464
[RIN]
Rin Matsuoka.

273
00:13:27,547 --> 00:13:31,092
Oh. The freestyle swimmer.
What brings ya here?

274
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:32,719
Well, I've been
studying in Sydney,

275
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:35,847
but I'm back in town for
the All-Japan Invitational.

276
00:13:35,930 --> 00:13:36,931
Sydney?

277
00:13:37,015 --> 00:13:38,308
I don't suppose you've
run into someone

278
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,101
named Mikhail over
there, have ya?

279
00:13:40,185 --> 00:13:41,811
Yeah, that's my coach.

280
00:13:44,022 --> 00:13:46,024
Really?

281
00:13:46,107 --> 00:13:48,902
So the kid I'm coaching
is about to go

282
00:13:48,985 --> 00:13:51,237
head-to-head with the kid
he's been coaching.

283
00:13:51,321 --> 00:13:53,615
Seems like fate.

284
00:13:53,698 --> 00:13:57,369
Does that mean you're officially
Haru's coach now, Mr. Azuma?

285
00:13:57,452 --> 00:13:58,912
Yeah, in theory.

286
00:13:58,995 --> 00:14:01,790
But he doesn't listen
to a word I say.

287
00:14:01,873 --> 00:14:04,000
Come on out for the day, Nanase!

288
00:14:04,084 --> 00:14:05,377
[laughs]

289
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:07,754
[RIN] This guy was Mikhail's
rival back in the day.

290
00:14:07,837 --> 00:14:10,715
Gou called him "Perfect
Killer-muscles Handsome,"

291
00:14:10,799 --> 00:14:12,509
Ryuji Azuma.

292
00:14:13,551 --> 00:14:15,887
[AZUMA] Ya have to start
over from square one.

293
00:14:15,970 --> 00:14:18,640
What good would it do me
to go backwards at this point?

294
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:21,685
[AZUMA] Did ya not hear
anything I said about <i>shuhari</i> ?

295
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:22,686
[HARUKA]
That again?

296
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:24,354
Haru.

297
00:14:24,437 --> 00:14:26,481
Makoto? What are you doing here?

298
00:14:26,564 --> 00:14:29,859
[MAKOTO] I couldn't reach you,
so I was getting worried.

299
00:14:29,943 --> 00:14:32,987
Sorry. I've been ignoring
my phone for two weeks.

300
00:14:33,071 --> 00:14:36,616
That's okay. It's
good to see you.

301
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,369
But back to what
Mr. Azuma was saying.

302
00:14:39,452 --> 00:14:41,413
When you fillet mackerel,
you're always supposed to

303
00:14:41,496 --> 00:14:42,997
sharpen the knife first, right?

304
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:43,873
What's that got to do--

305
00:14:43,957 --> 00:14:45,208
[HARUKA]
Of course.

306
00:14:45,291 --> 00:14:47,460
It's the only way you're
going to get a clean cut.

307
00:14:47,544 --> 00:14:49,713
Well, that's kinda what
bein' a swimmer is like.

308
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:51,631
Before you can attack
your goals, it's important

309
00:14:51,715 --> 00:14:54,467
to sharpen yourself,
just like you would a knife.

310
00:14:54,551 --> 00:14:56,011
I'm pretty sure that's
what your coach

311
00:14:56,094 --> 00:14:57,721
was trying to tell you.

312
00:14:59,931 --> 00:15:01,725
[HARUKA]
Start from the beginning.

313
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:03,852
[MAKOTO chuckles]

314
00:15:03,935 --> 00:15:07,397
[clears throat] Okay, like I've
told you a million times.

315
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,065
It's all about technique.

316
00:15:10,066 --> 00:15:12,027
[AZUMA]
That's the idea. Got it?

317
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:14,279
Yeah. I'll remember.

318
00:15:14,362 --> 00:15:16,197
Took ya long enough.

319
00:15:16,281 --> 00:15:17,907
[RIN]
Done with your chat, Haru?

320
00:15:17,991 --> 00:15:18,867
[BOTH gasp]

321
00:15:18,950 --> 00:15:20,285
[HARUKA]
Rin!

322
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:25,915
[RIN] How long's it been?
Since that surprise party?

323
00:15:25,999 --> 00:15:27,250
Think so.

324
00:15:27,334 --> 00:15:29,336
Got pretty heated during
your practice back there.

325
00:15:29,419 --> 00:15:30,170
Yeah.

326
00:15:30,253 --> 00:15:31,921
[laughs]

327
00:15:32,005 --> 00:15:32,797
[HARUKA]
What's funny?

328
00:15:32,881 --> 00:15:33,965
I dunno.

329
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:36,801
Haven't seen that side
of you in a while.

330
00:15:38,011 --> 00:15:41,681
I'd never felt that before.

331
00:15:41,765 --> 00:15:44,851
Like the water was being
sucked away from me.

332
00:15:44,934 --> 00:15:45,894
I was swimming,

333
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:48,480
but it didn't feel
like it somehow.

334
00:15:48,563 --> 00:15:50,482
Jeez, the guy must've
been pretty incredible

335
00:15:50,565 --> 00:15:52,609
for you to talk like that.

336
00:15:52,692 --> 00:15:54,110
Sounds exciting!

337
00:15:54,194 --> 00:15:56,071
Haven't changed, have you?

338
00:15:56,154 --> 00:15:58,239
[RIN]
I change every day.

339
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,575
My times are always
changin', too.

340
00:16:00,658 --> 00:16:03,495
But if there's anything
that has stayed the same,

341
00:16:03,578 --> 00:16:06,915
it's this: I still
wanna swim with you.

342
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:12,379
[RIN] I can't wait to
race you in freestyle.

343
00:16:12,462 --> 00:16:13,713
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

344
00:16:19,511 --> 00:16:22,555
[MAKOTO] They're aiming
for the global level.

345
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,183
So... what can I do?

346
00:16:25,266 --> 00:16:28,478
[AZUMA] Hey. You're
somethin', you know that?

347
00:16:28,561 --> 00:16:29,854
Me?

348
00:16:29,938 --> 00:16:31,439
You have a knack for getting
into an athlete's head

349
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:32,774
and makin' 'em listen.

350
00:16:32,857 --> 00:16:34,943
I've known Haru for a long time.

351
00:16:35,026 --> 00:16:37,445
Still, it's not as easy
as you might think.

352
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:40,407
The better a swimmer gets,
the more stubborn he can be.

353
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:41,991
[gasps]

354
00:16:44,953 --> 00:16:47,414
Look. I have to ask.

355
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,249
Why are you coaching him?

356
00:16:51,084 --> 00:16:53,086
He captured my
interest because he's

357
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:56,715
so damned comfortable
in the water.

358
00:16:56,798 --> 00:16:58,967
When I used to compete,
I won all the races

359
00:16:59,050 --> 00:17:03,013
that I was mentally into, and
lost all the ones that I wasn't.

360
00:17:03,096 --> 00:17:06,558
I realized I'd hit
my limit, so I retired.

361
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:08,143
But since then,
I've never stopped

362
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:10,353
thinking about swimming.

363
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:13,857
I kept looking for an
outlet besides competing.

364
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,568
Then one day, I decided
I wanted to help train

365
00:17:16,651 --> 00:17:18,987
new swimmers who had the
potential to reach a level

366
00:17:19,070 --> 00:17:20,405
that I never could.

367
00:17:20,488 --> 00:17:22,615
I went searching for
swimmers overseas,

368
00:17:22,699 --> 00:17:24,826
but no one stood out to me.

369
00:17:24,909 --> 00:17:27,996
Until... I saw Nanase.

370
00:17:30,665 --> 00:17:33,418
[AZUMA] And yet, he limits
himself to freestyle.

371
00:17:33,501 --> 00:17:36,546
How's that for
some irony, right?

372
00:17:36,629 --> 00:17:39,090
But, that kind of
obsession is exactly

373
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:41,843
what creates a top-rate athlete.

374
00:17:41,926 --> 00:17:44,929
He has the focus that
I was always missing.

375
00:17:45,013 --> 00:17:48,308
Finding him was
like striking gold.

376
00:17:48,391 --> 00:17:49,601
One day,

377
00:17:49,684 --> 00:17:53,188
I know he'll be a better
swimmer than I ever was.

378
00:17:53,271 --> 00:17:55,523
[gasps]

379
00:17:55,607 --> 00:17:57,484
Don't tell him that, though.

380
00:18:01,821 --> 00:18:02,864
Hey.

381
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,741
What's up, you two?

382
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:10,288
Wow. You found a great coach.

383
00:18:10,372 --> 00:18:11,539
[HARUKA]
Hm?

384
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:16,753
[MAKOTO]
A way to engage with swimming

385
00:18:16,836 --> 00:18:18,838
without competing.

386
00:18:25,512 --> 00:18:27,681
Hey, Misaki, ready?

387
00:18:27,764 --> 00:18:29,015
[MISAKI]
Yeah!

388
00:18:34,938 --> 00:18:38,024
[MAKOTO]
Okay. Let's have a talk.

389
00:18:42,278 --> 00:18:44,114
[MAKOTO]
Try to relax more.

390
00:18:44,197 --> 00:18:45,281
Right.

391
00:18:46,991 --> 00:18:48,702
[MISAKI] I guess I've been
thinking so much about

392
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:51,746
swimming with Natsume again
that I started to tense up.

393
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:54,124
That's what makes
a good rivalry, though.

394
00:18:54,207 --> 00:18:55,208
[MISAKI]
Hm?

395
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:58,378
I know a lot of
relationships like that.

396
00:18:58,461 --> 00:19:00,672
One person takes
it super seriously

397
00:19:00,755 --> 00:19:03,675
and gets obsessed with
facing the other person.

398
00:19:03,758 --> 00:19:05,552
Or they get separated
from their rival

399
00:19:05,635 --> 00:19:08,471
for a long time,
and when they meet again,

400
00:19:08,555 --> 00:19:11,891
their feelings are so intense
that they end up clashing.

401
00:19:11,975 --> 00:19:14,686
But every time,
things somehow turn out

402
00:19:14,769 --> 00:19:16,980
for the best once
they swim together.

403
00:19:20,233 --> 00:19:21,818
It'll be the same for you.

404
00:19:21,901 --> 00:19:23,069
I'm sure swimming with him again

405
00:19:23,153 --> 00:19:25,488
will help you to see
things more clearly.

406
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,284
It's important to
treasure the bond

407
00:19:29,367 --> 00:19:31,077
the two of you have.

408
00:19:31,161 --> 00:19:32,537
You're getting this
chance to see him

409
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,081
because you've stuck
with swimming.

410
00:19:35,165 --> 00:19:38,418
You've got to cherish every race
with a rival like that.

411
00:19:42,839 --> 00:19:45,091
[MAKOTO]
So that's Natsume, huh?

412
00:19:47,844 --> 00:19:49,929
[MISAKI, NATSUME gasp]

413
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:03,193
[whistle blows]

414
00:20:03,276 --> 00:20:04,903
[ANNOUNCER 10A]
Take your marks.

415
00:20:04,986 --> 00:20:07,364
--[beep]
--[CROWD] Go!

416
00:20:07,447 --> 00:20:09,783
--[NAO] Go!
--[MAKOTO] Misaki!

417
00:20:11,659 --> 00:20:13,203
[MISAKI]
This feeling.

418
00:20:16,623 --> 00:20:19,751
[MISAKI, NATSUME laughing]

419
00:20:20,752 --> 00:20:22,212
Ha!

420
00:20:25,548 --> 00:20:27,467
[MISAKI]
It's just like before!

421
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:32,222
--[NAO] Keep it up!
--[MAKOTO] Yeah!

422
00:20:37,352 --> 00:20:38,728
Last stretch!

423
00:20:50,699 --> 00:20:51,866
[gasps]

424
00:20:57,497 --> 00:20:59,249
[MISAKI]
Natsume.

425
00:20:59,332 --> 00:21:00,583
You were great!

426
00:21:00,667 --> 00:21:03,461
[gasps] Thanks a lot!

427
00:21:03,545 --> 00:21:05,422
I think your swimming
was awesome, Misaki!

428
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,090
I'm glad we got to
swim together again!

429
00:21:07,173 --> 00:21:08,967
It was fun!

430
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:11,177
Right? Me, too!

431
00:21:11,261 --> 00:21:12,012
[MISAKI]
Coach!

432
00:21:12,095 --> 00:21:13,722
Nice swimming, Misaki!

433
00:21:13,805 --> 00:21:14,973
I know you didn't wanna lose,

434
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:17,392
but at least you beat
your personal best time!

435
00:21:17,475 --> 00:21:18,476
Yeah!

436
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,936
I think having a chance
to race with him

437
00:21:20,020 --> 00:21:22,022
was what pushed me
to try my hardest!

438
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,482
Oh, and, uh...

439
00:21:24,566 --> 00:21:26,317
You were a big help, too!

440
00:21:26,401 --> 00:21:27,819
[gasps]

441
00:21:34,659 --> 00:21:37,704
Anyway, I'd better get going,
but thanks for everything!

442
00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:42,334
[MAKOTO]
Hey, listen.

443
00:21:42,417 --> 00:21:44,419
What you said about
becoming a trainer.

444
00:21:44,502 --> 00:21:46,338
Could you give me more details?

445
00:21:48,006 --> 00:21:49,049
Really?

446
00:21:49,132 --> 00:21:50,383
Yeah!

447
00:21:50,467 --> 00:21:52,052
I wanna make it my mission
to help great swimmers

448
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:55,680
achieve their dreams!
And not just Haru.

449
00:21:55,764 --> 00:21:57,390
Lots of people.

450
00:21:57,474 --> 00:22:00,018
The greatest athletes
in the world!

451
00:22:07,108 --> 00:22:09,194
[NAGISA]
Okay, let's get on board!

452
00:22:09,277 --> 00:22:10,737
I can't believe
it's finally time!

453
00:22:10,820 --> 00:22:12,072
[REI]
Oh, dear!

454
00:22:12,155 --> 00:22:14,407
Our train departs in one
minute--we need to hurry!

455
00:22:14,491 --> 00:22:15,450
Come on, let's go!

456
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,951
[NAGISA]
But I wanted to get lunch.

457
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:18,203
[AYUMU]
There's no time.

458
00:22:18,286 --> 00:22:20,038
[GOU]
Pick up the pace!

459
00:22:22,165 --> 00:22:23,750
[NAGISA]
We're headed to Tokyo!

460
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:25,794
[REI] And this is our last
summer in high school!

461
00:22:25,877 --> 00:22:28,338
[NAGISA] Next time:
"Streamline of Unity!"

462
00:22:28,421 --> 00:22:29,881
[REI]
All we can do is our best!
