1
00:00:26,850 --> 00:00:29,811
[phone buzzes]

2
00:00:29,894 --> 00:00:30,979
Hey.

3
00:00:31,062 --> 00:00:32,939
[MAKOTO] Hi, Haru?
Do you have a minute?

4
00:00:33,023 --> 00:00:34,315
Yeah, what's up?

5
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,692
[MAKOTO] You know how
we bought suits for the

6
00:00:35,775 --> 00:00:38,236
University Entrance
Ceremony yesterday?

7
00:00:38,319 --> 00:00:40,155
Well, it looks like they
gave me the voucher

8
00:00:40,238 --> 00:00:41,823
for your suit on accident.

9
00:00:41,906 --> 00:00:45,035
So yeah, I was wondering
if you might have mine.

10
00:00:45,118 --> 00:00:46,244
I've got it.

11
00:00:46,327 --> 00:00:49,330
[MAKOTO] Really? Okay good.
That's a relief.

12
00:00:49,414 --> 00:00:51,541
I couldn't find it anywhere,
so I was starting to worry

13
00:00:51,624 --> 00:00:53,418
that I might've dropped it.

14
00:00:53,501 --> 00:00:55,879
Wanna meet up later today
and grab our suits together?

15
00:00:55,962 --> 00:00:57,047
[MAKOTO]
Good thinkin'.

16
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:59,382
Yeah. Would you be
free to meet up at six?

17
00:00:59,466 --> 00:01:02,552
I've got a few places I
need to stop by beforehand.

18
00:01:02,635 --> 00:01:04,220
Don't tell me you're
still trying to hunt down

19
00:01:04,304 --> 00:01:06,097
those presents for Ren and Ran.

20
00:01:06,181 --> 00:01:08,892
[MAKOTO] I am. Apparently
they're super popular.

21
00:01:08,975 --> 00:01:12,354
None of the stores I've been to
had any in stock. But still...

22
00:01:12,437 --> 00:01:14,898
...sounds like the twins have
wanted these for a long time,

23
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:18,193
so I'm gonna try and track some
down before their birthday.

24
00:01:18,276 --> 00:01:21,029
Okay. Well, hopefully you'll
be able to find them.

25
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:22,739
Thanks, I appreciate it.

26
00:01:22,822 --> 00:01:24,699
Anyway, I'll see you
at the store at six.

27
00:01:24,783 --> 00:01:26,910
Right. I'll be in touch later.

28
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:31,331
I'd better go soon. I've got
my keys and wallet on me...

29
00:01:31,414 --> 00:01:33,750
Wait. Where's... Where's my bag?

30
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,052
[OMASA] I think we drove
past here in the truck,

31
00:03:07,135 --> 00:03:11,056
but I'm not sure.
Aw, I don't see it anywhere.

32
00:03:11,139 --> 00:03:14,059
[YAMANAKA groans] Crap!
This event is a do-or-die,

33
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:16,353
once-in-a-lifetime
chance for Iwatobi!

34
00:03:16,436 --> 00:03:18,396
But we lost the
beak in transport.

35
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,023
And Fujii was supposed
to wear the costume,

36
00:03:20,106 --> 00:03:21,733
but now he's running late!

37
00:03:21,816 --> 00:03:24,235
He says he won't be able
to make it until four PM.

38
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,613
[yells] That isn't even
close to soon enough--

39
00:03:26,696 --> 00:03:28,114
the first match'll be over!

40
00:03:28,198 --> 00:03:30,158
You wear it in
his place, Kasahara!

41
00:03:30,241 --> 00:03:33,161
I would, but I have a crippling
fear of mascot costumes.

42
00:03:33,244 --> 00:03:34,871
Well then why did
you take this job?

43
00:03:34,954 --> 00:03:37,082
We do nothing but
follow a mascot around!

44
00:03:37,165 --> 00:03:39,167
Won't you be fine once
you're inside the thing?

45
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,669
Too scary.

46
00:03:40,752 --> 00:03:43,380
[YAMANAKA groans] I'd do it
myself if not for my hernia.

47
00:03:43,463 --> 00:03:45,090
[yelps]

48
00:03:45,173 --> 00:03:48,885
It's all over. Little Iwatobi's
gonna lose by default.

49
00:03:48,968 --> 00:03:51,429
Don't even talk like that,
we're not gonna let that happen!

50
00:03:51,513 --> 00:03:54,307
Our mission is to make
Little Iwatobi's name famous!

51
00:03:54,391 --> 00:03:56,309
To help all of Japan to
recognize the greatness

52
00:03:56,393 --> 00:03:57,977
of the town of Iwatobi!

53
00:03:58,061 --> 00:04:00,188
[gasps] Wow, Yamanaka.

54
00:04:00,271 --> 00:04:03,400
Our Little Iwatobi's
about to dive to the future.

55
00:04:03,483 --> 00:04:05,568
Yeah? Then I sure
hope you have a plan.

56
00:04:05,652 --> 00:04:08,405
Indeed I do. Before the first
match of the tournament,

57
00:04:08,488 --> 00:04:09,656
we're gonna find
ourselves a beak,

58
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,199
and a substitute wrestler!

59
00:04:11,282 --> 00:04:13,535
[KASAHARA, OMASA]
Hm! Yes, sir!

60
00:04:14,869 --> 00:04:16,079
[HARUKA]
Hm?

61
00:04:18,873 --> 00:04:23,294
[HARUKA] This looks like...
Little Iwatobi's beak.

62
00:04:23,378 --> 00:04:25,338
But why is it here?

63
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:33,722
[MAKOTO groans] They're sold
out everywhere. Oh well.

64
00:04:33,805 --> 00:04:37,142
Where do I go to next? Uh...

65
00:04:39,144 --> 00:04:41,646
[MAKOTO]
"Regional Mascot Sumo"?

66
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:46,276
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Bet Haru would love that.

67
00:04:56,745 --> 00:04:58,997
[REI] I'm roughly ten
meters from the target.

68
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,665
According to my best estimate,

69
00:05:00,749 --> 00:05:02,751
I should be working with
a zero point five meter

70
00:05:02,834 --> 00:05:05,587
per second tailwind, with a
moderate drift to the left.

71
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:07,380
So if my calculations
are correct...

72
00:05:07,464 --> 00:05:08,506
...with this much force...

73
00:05:08,590 --> 00:05:09,924
...coming from this angle...

74
00:05:10,008 --> 00:05:11,468
...I'll hit dead on!

75
00:05:11,551 --> 00:05:13,345
Huh? The wind
suddenly shifted.

76
00:05:13,428 --> 00:05:14,095
[whistle blows]

77
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,972
Why?!

78
00:05:16,056 --> 00:05:18,016
Aw, man. That wasn't even close.

79
00:05:18,099 --> 00:05:19,893
[MOMOTARO]
Yeah!

80
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:21,227
[REI]
I'm sorry.

81
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:22,479
No worries.

82
00:05:22,562 --> 00:05:24,230
I think you go next, Momo.

83
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:27,192
Okay! Here goes!

84
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:30,278
Behold my Ultra
Stream Otter Kick!

85
00:05:31,571 --> 00:05:33,782
[NITORI]
What?! Two panels!

86
00:05:33,865 --> 00:05:35,408
Momo's crazy, but he's
still a real threat...

87
00:05:35,492 --> 00:05:38,536
[REI] No way.
He had such sloppy form.

88
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:39,579
[NITORI grunts]

89
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,040
[NAGISA grunts]

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:46,211
[NAGISA, UOZUMI, MOMOTARO]
All right!

91
00:05:46,294 --> 00:05:49,005
[MOMOTARO]
A fabulous prize, woo hoo!

92
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:52,926
[NAGISA]
Hey, Rei. Ya want some?

93
00:05:53,009 --> 00:05:55,303
[NAGISA chuckles]

94
00:05:55,387 --> 00:05:57,305
I'd love some,
thank you, Nagisa.

95
00:05:57,389 --> 00:06:00,517
[NITORI] Does Iwatobi throw a
festival like this every year?

96
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,519
[REI]
No. This is the first one.

97
00:06:02,602 --> 00:06:05,355
The chamber of commerce started
it to try to liven up the town.

98
00:06:05,438 --> 00:06:07,524
It seems to be going
pretty well. I like it.

99
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:10,360
Yeah. I'm glad we got a chance
to relax, after a whole

100
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:12,862
spring break of
"Mikoshiba's special training."

101
00:06:12,946 --> 00:06:15,532
Heh. It feels as though
providence brought us

102
00:06:15,615 --> 00:06:17,659
to this festival to
reward our hard work.

103
00:06:17,742 --> 00:06:21,204
A little surprise gift from
the spring breeze itself.

104
00:06:21,287 --> 00:06:22,706
Yeah. Sure.

105
00:06:22,789 --> 00:06:24,874
I doubt I would've come here
if you hadn't invited me,

106
00:06:24,958 --> 00:06:26,459
so thanks, Nagisa.

107
00:06:26,543 --> 00:06:28,586
Of course, festivals are always
more fun with lots of people.

108
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,796
[MOMOTARO]
Not that you guys aren't fun,

109
00:06:29,879 --> 00:06:32,465
but I wish Gou could've
made it out, too.

110
00:06:32,549 --> 00:06:35,677
She's with her family right now,
but she said she'd come later.

111
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:37,804
Yahoo!

112
00:06:37,887 --> 00:06:41,141
Oh! Say, does anyone else
feel like getting lunch soon?

113
00:06:41,224 --> 00:06:42,726
Yes, I could eat.

114
00:06:42,809 --> 00:06:44,644
All the snacks I had just made
me hungrier for some real food.

115
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,938
[gasps] Hey! Here's an idea!

116
00:06:47,022 --> 00:06:49,899
Let's grab some food and
then eat over there!

117
00:06:49,983 --> 00:06:51,818
Iwatobi's doing a sumo match?

118
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:53,695
[REI] Yeah, they're having
a mascot tournament in Tokyo,

119
00:06:53,778 --> 00:06:55,739
and the whole thing'll
be streamed online.

120
00:06:55,822 --> 00:06:57,657
[UOZUMI]
What even is a Little Iwatobi?

121
00:06:57,741 --> 00:07:00,785
[NAGISA]
H-Huh?! Oh, come on!

122
00:07:00,869 --> 00:07:02,787
Iwa means "boulder,"
tobi means "black kite,"

123
00:07:02,871 --> 00:07:04,497
so it's a boulder-headed bird!

124
00:07:04,581 --> 00:07:07,250
You might also want to mention
that it's the regional mascot.

125
00:07:07,334 --> 00:07:08,793
Yeah, I've seen it before.

126
00:07:08,877 --> 00:07:11,254
Gotta say, a bird with a rock
for a head is pretty weird.

127
00:07:11,338 --> 00:07:13,506
[NAGISA] Give it a rest,
it's not that weird!

128
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:16,843
Just look at the screen.
Little Iwatobi's adorable!

129
00:07:16,926 --> 00:07:18,219
And he'll be even
cuter in motion,

130
00:07:18,303 --> 00:07:20,347
so let's cheer him on together!

131
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,891
[footsteps]

132
00:07:22,974 --> 00:07:24,225
[MIYAKO]
Oh.

133
00:07:24,309 --> 00:07:27,228
It figures Rin would've
stopped by before he left.

134
00:07:27,312 --> 00:07:28,980
'Course he would.

135
00:07:30,523 --> 00:07:34,152
[GOU] Hey, Dad. I'm guessing
Rin told you this himself.

136
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:36,780
But he's leaving home to do
some training in Australia,

137
00:07:36,863 --> 00:07:39,574
so please watch over
him while he's away.

138
00:07:39,657 --> 00:07:41,951
And please watch over
me and Mom, too.

139
00:07:42,035 --> 00:07:43,995
We'll be counting on you.

140
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:47,499
[chuckles] You've given
him quite the workload.

141
00:07:47,582 --> 00:07:50,085
That's cause I know
Dad can handle it!

142
00:07:50,168 --> 00:07:51,378
Anyway, I gotta go.

143
00:07:51,461 --> 00:07:53,380
The festival's already
gotten started.

144
00:07:53,463 --> 00:07:55,298
Why the rush? Got a date?

145
00:07:55,382 --> 00:07:56,424
[gasps] No way.

146
00:07:56,508 --> 00:07:57,717
I'm just going to meet up

147
00:07:57,801 --> 00:07:59,386
with Hana and a few other
friends, that's all.

148
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:03,973
Oh. All right, I'll let you
leave it at that for now.

149
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,433
'Kay, I'd better get going.

150
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:08,019
I'll call you when
I'm on my way home.

151
00:08:08,103 --> 00:08:10,730
Sure. You make good
choices, all right?

152
00:08:14,484 --> 00:08:17,487
Rin and Gou are both
doing great, dear.

153
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:18,947
We love you.

154
00:08:23,076 --> 00:08:26,705
[RIN] It's finally time
to take on the world.

155
00:08:27,747 --> 00:08:30,917
[RIN] Hey, old man.
You're watchin' right?

156
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:33,586
'Cause I'm just gettin' started.

157
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:50,103
[ASAHI]
'Sup, Kisumi?

158
00:08:50,186 --> 00:08:51,312
Yo!

159
00:08:51,396 --> 00:08:53,815
So, I kinda got lost
on the way over here.

160
00:08:53,898 --> 00:08:55,108
Hey, at least you made it.

161
00:08:55,191 --> 00:08:57,235
Heck yeah. How've ya been?

162
00:08:57,318 --> 00:08:58,862
I see you're already
getting a head start

163
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:01,489
in the working man department,
what's that like?

164
00:09:01,573 --> 00:09:04,826
Oh, well, my uncle's in real
estate and this is his office.

165
00:09:04,909 --> 00:09:06,745
I've been working here
since spring break started.

166
00:09:06,828 --> 00:09:07,996
It's a good gig.

167
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:10,165
That would explain why
you weren't in Iwatobi!

168
00:09:10,248 --> 00:09:13,001
It was my first time back
in ages. I missed you, man.

169
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,919
I heard you brought a whole
bunch of millet dumplings

170
00:09:15,003 --> 00:09:17,797
for my family.
Hayato was super excited.

171
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,717
Oh, yeah. Your brother's
growing up crazy fast.

172
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,010
Threw me for a loop.

173
00:09:22,093 --> 00:09:24,429
Anyway, I brought a few
things for you, too.

174
00:09:24,512 --> 00:09:26,556
[KISUMI]
Oh, cool, thanks!

175
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:28,683
I gotta admit, you're
unexpectedly considerate

176
00:09:28,767 --> 00:09:30,518
when it comes to
this kinda thing.

177
00:09:30,602 --> 00:09:32,354
Why would that be unexpected?

178
00:09:32,437 --> 00:09:34,356
Do ya wanna stick around
and have some tea?

179
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,566
I would If I could, but I
need to run and pick up

180
00:09:36,649 --> 00:09:38,485
my suit for the
entrance ceremony.

181
00:09:38,568 --> 00:09:40,695
Gotta do what'cha gotta do.

182
00:09:40,779 --> 00:09:43,365
[ASAHI] Hm. At least we're
goin' to the same college,

183
00:09:43,448 --> 00:09:45,950
am I right? I'll catch
you at the ceremony.

184
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:47,869
Right, I'll see ya
pretty soon then.

185
00:09:47,952 --> 00:09:50,163
So you got in with a
sports recommendation?

186
00:09:50,246 --> 00:09:51,247
[ASAHI]
Yeah.

187
00:09:51,331 --> 00:09:52,624
Well, now I can't
wait for college.

188
00:09:52,707 --> 00:09:54,125
I'll get to play
basketball with ya.

189
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:56,419
[ASAHI] I got in for swimming,
you know that, dude!

190
00:09:56,503 --> 00:09:59,839
[KISUMI] Ha! Yeah. Hey, before
you take off, one thing.

191
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:01,800
The other day,
Makoto and Haru came--

192
00:10:01,883 --> 00:10:03,802
--[phone buzzing]
--[ASAHI] Ah. One second.

193
00:10:03,885 --> 00:10:05,845
Shoot. It's from my sister.

194
00:10:05,929 --> 00:10:08,932
I'm s'posed to grab a few
things for her. I'd better go.

195
00:10:09,015 --> 00:10:10,600
Thanks for the present.
You're good.

196
00:10:10,684 --> 00:10:13,561
No prob, Kisumi.
I'll see ya. Take care.

197
00:10:13,645 --> 00:10:14,979
Sure thing.

198
00:10:16,564 --> 00:10:20,694
Well. It's fine, I'll have lots
of chances to tell him later.

199
00:10:20,777 --> 00:10:24,364
[MAKOTO groans] Can't seem
to find them anywhere.

200
00:10:24,447 --> 00:10:27,992
Sorry! I didn't see you.
Little Iwatobi?

201
00:10:28,076 --> 00:10:29,244
Wait!

202
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:31,996
Sir. I take it you know
who Little Iwatobi is?

203
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:36,376
Uh. Yeah. I mean I'm from
Iwatobi, so there's that.

204
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:38,378
Oh, yeah, he's the one.

205
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:41,256
Agreed. He's athletic,
and the right height.

206
00:10:41,339 --> 00:10:42,590
What now?

207
00:10:42,674 --> 00:10:44,342
You don't have a crippling
fear of mascot costumes,

208
00:10:44,426 --> 00:10:45,885
--now do ya?
--[MAKOTO] Huh?

209
00:10:45,969 --> 00:10:48,471
[OMASA] You like Iwatobi, right?
You're a fan, aren't you?

210
00:10:48,555 --> 00:10:50,015
Yeah. Sure.

211
00:10:50,098 --> 00:10:52,183
Then it seems to me that
this is your lucky day,

212
00:10:52,267 --> 00:10:53,268
and ours as well.

213
00:10:53,351 --> 00:10:55,228
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Kay.

214
00:10:55,311 --> 00:10:58,189
[GROUP] Please, sir: the town
of Iwatobi is in your hands!

215
00:10:58,273 --> 00:11:00,233
[MAKOTO]
I would, but I'm--

216
00:11:00,316 --> 00:11:02,068
[YAMANAKA] But, I'm sure you
can be a little late, right?

217
00:11:02,152 --> 00:11:04,612
C'mon, just hear us out, we'll
treat you well, I promise.

218
00:11:04,696 --> 00:11:05,822
Huh.

219
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,786
Tokyo really is
bustling, isn't it?

220
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,663
[IKUYA]
Yeah, makes it hard to relax.

221
00:11:13,747 --> 00:11:15,206
Aw...

222
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:17,375
Personally, I've been looking
forward to moving out here.

223
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:20,211
It's a definite change
of pace from Kyoto.

224
00:11:20,295 --> 00:11:21,755
But there're still
some quiet places.

225
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:23,715
This café has a nice vibe.

226
00:11:23,798 --> 00:11:26,009
I don't exactly hate it.

227
00:11:26,092 --> 00:11:29,763
Ha! I figured you would
say something like that.

228
00:11:29,846 --> 00:11:33,350
Oh, yeah, Have you gotten a suit
for the entrance ceremony?

229
00:11:33,433 --> 00:11:35,060
Haven't had a chance.

230
00:11:35,143 --> 00:11:38,104
[HIYORI] What? You know it's
the day after tomorrow, right?

231
00:11:38,188 --> 00:11:40,815
[phone buzzes]

232
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:42,108
[HIYORI]
What's up?

233
00:11:42,192 --> 00:11:45,570
It's from Natsuya.
He texted "don't overdo it."

234
00:11:45,653 --> 00:11:47,572
He doesn't know what
he's talking about.

235
00:11:47,655 --> 00:11:50,325
[laughs] It sounds like he's
just worried about you.

236
00:11:50,408 --> 00:11:52,494
That's what big
brothers are for.

237
00:11:52,577 --> 00:11:53,828
But I'm not a kid anymore.

238
00:11:53,912 --> 00:11:55,622
[HIYORI] Well, as your
friend, I'm worried, too.

239
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:57,916
If you've suddenly become
such a responsible adult,

240
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:01,544
then where's your suit
for the entrance ceremony?

241
00:12:01,628 --> 00:12:03,505
I know! Why don't we
shop for one together?

242
00:12:03,588 --> 00:12:05,215
[IKUYA]
I'm still eating.

243
00:12:06,675 --> 00:12:08,843
[NATSUYA]
Hey. Nao. How've you been?

244
00:12:08,927 --> 00:12:12,555
Not bad. It's good to hear ya.
How are the States treating you?

245
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:13,765
[NATSUYA]
All right.

246
00:12:13,848 --> 00:12:15,975
Just finished a race
in San Francisco.

247
00:12:16,059 --> 00:12:19,688
And right now, I'm about
to get on a bus to LA.

248
00:12:19,771 --> 00:12:21,898
[NAO]
Sounds like an intense schedule.

249
00:12:21,981 --> 00:12:25,777
Well, I'm used to it. What's new
on your end? Ya done moving yet?

250
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,320
[NAO]
Finished last week.

251
00:12:27,404 --> 00:12:29,406
It sucked havin' to move from
my old place just 'cause

252
00:12:29,489 --> 00:12:32,242
the campus changed
locations, but that's life.

253
00:12:32,325 --> 00:12:33,702
[NATSUYA] So did you
have to quit your job

254
00:12:33,785 --> 00:12:34,994
at the district pool then?

255
00:12:35,078 --> 00:12:37,706
Yeah. I'm really gonna
miss my students.

256
00:12:37,789 --> 00:12:39,249
Didn't get to tell
them all bye either,

257
00:12:39,332 --> 00:12:41,418
so that was disappointing.

258
00:12:41,501 --> 00:12:44,045
Too bad, but I bet a lot of
them'll keep on swimming,

259
00:12:44,129 --> 00:12:46,256
and, as long as they do,
you never know...

260
00:12:46,339 --> 00:12:48,633
You might run into
them again someday.

261
00:12:48,717 --> 00:12:53,346
Yeah. I hope that happens.
Oh, and speaking of which.

262
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:56,558
Your brother'll be at a college
in Tokyo come April, right?

263
00:12:56,641 --> 00:12:58,560
Scary stuff. You okay?

264
00:12:58,643 --> 00:13:01,438
Don't talk to me like I'm
an overprotective parent.

265
00:13:04,232 --> 00:13:05,567
[NATSUYA]
Turns out,

266
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:07,944
Ikuya's friend Hiyori is going
to Shimogami with him.

267
00:13:08,028 --> 00:13:09,154
So he won't be alone.

268
00:13:09,237 --> 00:13:10,905
[NAO]
Yeah, he'll be fine.

269
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,616
[NATSUYA] Anyway. I'll bring
a little somethin' back for ya

270
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,076
the next time I'm in Japan.

271
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,829
[NAO laughs]
Looking forward to it.

272
00:13:17,912 --> 00:13:20,206
I've got those weird dolls you
brought me last time sitting in

273
00:13:20,290 --> 00:13:22,167
a place of honor on my desk.

274
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:25,587
Oh. I think those were
tournament mascots.

275
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:27,380
Had no idea what
they were at the time.

276
00:13:27,464 --> 00:13:28,631
They're great.

277
00:13:28,715 --> 00:13:31,092
I'm excited to see what
souvenir ya get me next.

278
00:13:31,176 --> 00:13:34,846
Hey, a gag gift's better than
no gift, so drop the tone.

279
00:13:34,929 --> 00:13:39,184
Heh. Well, what do I care?
Till next time, Nao.

280
00:13:39,267 --> 00:13:41,770
[NAO]
Yeah. Catch you later, Natsuya.

281
00:13:42,771 --> 00:13:45,273
[GOU]
Sosuke, over here!

282
00:13:45,357 --> 00:13:47,984
[GOU laughs]
Hey, I'm glad you made it!

283
00:13:48,068 --> 00:13:49,736
--[HANAMURA] Good afternoon.
--[SOSUKE] Hey.

284
00:13:49,819 --> 00:13:52,072
It was nice of you to come
and hang out with us today.

285
00:13:52,155 --> 00:13:54,491
Will things be okay at the
restaurant without you?

286
00:13:54,574 --> 00:13:57,327
Yeah. My cousin who's
the chef is helping today,

287
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,703
so I got the day off.

288
00:13:58,787 --> 00:14:01,331
Sosuke helps out at the
restaurant his family owns.

289
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:02,832
Wow, that's pretty cool.

290
00:14:02,916 --> 00:14:05,377
So do you plan to take
over the family business?

291
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:08,380
--No. I, uh...
--[NAGISA] Gou! Sosuke! Hana!

292
00:14:08,463 --> 00:14:09,881
There you are!

293
00:14:09,964 --> 00:14:12,050
What's up, Nag? We're
not too late, are we?

294
00:14:12,133 --> 00:14:14,719
Nah! Everyone's gathered
over there, come on!

295
00:14:14,803 --> 00:14:17,138
Sosuke, what's up?

296
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:18,640
I'm glad you could make it out!

297
00:14:18,723 --> 00:14:19,974
[BOYS]
Same here!

298
00:14:20,058 --> 00:14:21,101
[SOSUKE]
Thanks.

299
00:14:21,184 --> 00:14:23,144
We got permission
to slack off today!

300
00:14:23,228 --> 00:14:25,814
Tell ya what, Gou: how about I
get us both some <i>yakisoba</i> ?

301
00:14:25,897 --> 00:14:27,774
[GOU] Thanks, but I
already had lunch, so...

302
00:14:27,857 --> 00:14:29,651
What's goin' on here,
some kinda show?

303
00:14:29,734 --> 00:14:31,319
They're livestreaming
Little Iwatobi

304
00:14:31,403 --> 00:14:34,322
as he competes in a regional
mascot sumo tournament.

305
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:37,534
So all of us decided to watch it
from here as a show of support.

306
00:14:37,617 --> 00:14:39,869
Isn't Little Iwatobi the
mascot Haru likes?

307
00:14:39,953 --> 00:14:42,455
You guessed it!
That's our Sosuke!

308
00:14:42,539 --> 00:14:45,792
Unless I'm mistaken, the match
should start any second.

309
00:14:49,796 --> 00:14:52,340
[MAKOTO] Wait, so... You want
me to dress up as Iwatobi

310
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:53,842
and battle another mascot?

311
00:14:53,925 --> 00:14:55,844
Look, it's not a pit fight,
it's a sumo match.

312
00:14:55,927 --> 00:14:57,429
It'll all be very civilized.

313
00:14:57,512 --> 00:14:59,472
I realize this is sudden,
but your hometown needs you,

314
00:14:59,556 --> 00:15:01,725
so please rise up
to the challenge!

315
00:15:01,808 --> 00:15:03,685
[OMASA] I'm done taking
his measurements!

316
00:15:03,768 --> 00:15:05,770
The staffer who was meant
to do this is on his way.

317
00:15:05,854 --> 00:15:08,148
He should be here
by the next match.

318
00:15:08,231 --> 00:15:10,859
[MAKOTO] Wait. Sorry, but uh...
Shouldn't this guy have a beak?

319
00:15:10,942 --> 00:15:12,318
--[BOTH gasps]
--[MAKOTO] Hm?

320
00:15:12,402 --> 00:15:15,905
Yeah, he should have a beak.
But we lost it in transit.

321
00:15:15,989 --> 00:15:16,740
[MAKOTO]
Huh?

322
00:15:16,823 --> 00:15:18,324
[OMASA sobs]

323
00:15:18,408 --> 00:15:20,994
[YAMANAKA] Even now. Our people
are doing their best to find it.

324
00:15:21,077 --> 00:15:22,871
Guess fake beaks are
hard to come by.

325
00:15:22,954 --> 00:15:24,247
[YAMANAKA]
We need your help!

326
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,958
[OMASA] Please, sir!
Just be the sub for one match!

327
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:29,461
We won't keep you here
for any longer, we promise!

328
00:15:29,544 --> 00:15:31,046
[YAMANAKA]
It's just one match!

329
00:15:31,129 --> 00:15:32,630
All right, I'll do it.

330
00:15:32,714 --> 00:15:34,716
I still have a little more time
before I'm supposed to meet

331
00:15:34,799 --> 00:15:37,427
my friend, so if
I'm who you want...

332
00:15:37,510 --> 00:15:39,220
[BOTH gasp]

333
00:15:39,304 --> 00:15:41,514
[MIKOSHIBA] Hey! This
sure is a coincidence.

334
00:15:41,598 --> 00:15:43,850
I wasn't expecting to
run into you here.

335
00:15:43,933 --> 00:15:45,935
Same. Are you
out shopping, or...?

336
00:15:46,019 --> 00:15:48,730
[MIKOSHIBA] Yeah. Momotaro's
been pestering me for a toy.

337
00:15:48,813 --> 00:15:52,442
Somethin' to do with 3D deep
sea creatures. It's funny.

338
00:15:52,525 --> 00:15:53,735
He's in high school now,

339
00:15:53,818 --> 00:15:55,737
but he still has the taste
of a grade-schooler.

340
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:58,323
Think I remember seeing
that toy somewhere in there.

341
00:15:58,406 --> 00:16:01,034
[MIKOSHIBA] Oh cool. Really?
Well, that works out.

342
00:16:01,117 --> 00:16:04,412
I guess this shop is one of
those well-kept secrets, huh?

343
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:07,123
Uh... What'cha got there?

344
00:16:07,207 --> 00:16:09,334
I'm pretty sure it's
Little Iwatobi's beak.

345
00:16:09,417 --> 00:16:11,711
I found it on the
side of the road.

346
00:16:11,795 --> 00:16:14,506
How'd somethin' like
that end up in Tokyo?

347
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:16,800
Wait, now that I think about it,
I saw there's some kind of

348
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:18,718
regional mascot
thing goin' on today.

349
00:16:18,802 --> 00:16:21,888
Yeah! Tachibana was
involved somehow!

350
00:16:21,971 --> 00:16:23,223
Where'd you see him?

351
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,475
[YAMANAKA] How's it feel?
Everything tight?

352
00:16:25,558 --> 00:16:27,686
[MAKOTO]
Uh yeah! Real tight.

353
00:16:27,769 --> 00:16:29,813
[YAMANAKA] I'm extremely
reluctant to present

354
00:16:29,896 --> 00:16:32,941
Little Iwatobi to the world
in this improvised state.

355
00:16:33,024 --> 00:16:34,734
But I think we've done
all we can for now.

356
00:16:34,818 --> 00:16:36,236
[MAKOTO]
Right.

357
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:39,489
[MAKOTO sighs] I cannot
let Haru see me like this.

358
00:16:39,572 --> 00:16:41,324
--[HARUKA] Is Iwatobi here?
--[MAKOTO gasps]

359
00:16:42,784 --> 00:16:45,453
[HARUKA gasps]
S'cuse me.

360
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:48,373
[YAMANAKA gasps]
Y-You found it!

361
00:16:48,456 --> 00:16:49,624
[KASAHARA]
Iwatobi's beak!

362
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,626
[OMASA] This is amazing,
thanks for bringing it!

363
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,503
[YAMANAKA] What a relief.
Now we can show our

364
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:56,089
Little Iwatobi to the country
with full confidence!

365
00:16:56,172 --> 00:16:58,133
We're in your debt, truly!

366
00:16:58,216 --> 00:16:59,175
[HARUKA]
Sure.

367
00:16:59,259 --> 00:17:00,260
[YAMANAKA]
All right, Iwatobi.

368
00:17:00,343 --> 00:17:01,720
[MAKOTO gasps]

369
00:17:01,803 --> 00:17:03,638
[YAMANAKA] Turn around so I
can switch out your beak--

370
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:06,641
Hey, why are you running?
I'm not gonna hurt you!

371
00:17:06,725 --> 00:17:08,184
[YAMANAKA]
Mr. Tachibana, please!

372
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:09,978
I can't let you do the
match with the wrong beak!

373
00:17:10,061 --> 00:17:11,479
--Come back!
--[HARUKA] Hey, Makoto.

374
00:17:12,647 --> 00:17:14,149
[MAKOTO]
Hi.

375
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,735
[YAMANAKA] Oh. So the two
of you know each other.

376
00:17:16,818 --> 00:17:18,737
That explains
everything, actually.

377
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,656
Let's all do our best
as a team, okay?

378
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:22,699
So how--

379
00:17:22,782 --> 00:17:24,701
[MAKOTO]
Please don't ask right now.

380
00:17:24,784 --> 00:17:27,912
[NAGISA] Check it out!
The match is starting!

381
00:17:27,996 --> 00:17:30,206
[NITORI] I'm starting to feel
the hype all of a sudden.

382
00:17:30,290 --> 00:17:33,084
[UOZUMI] Huh, that looks like
a pretty professional set-up.

383
00:17:36,254 --> 00:17:38,882
[MIRACLE GLOVES-KUN grunts]

please take your
starting positions!

387
00:17:46,931 --> 00:17:49,726
[MAKOTO] I have to give my all.
This is for Iwatobi.

388
00:17:49,809 --> 00:17:51,644
For my home!

389
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:53,313
You can do this.

Come and get it. Rockhead.

it's a boulder!

He's strong. Can't move.

Do your best, okay?

00:18:20,715 --> 00:18:22,342
[REI gasps]
Hey, is something the matter?

401
00:18:22,425 --> 00:18:24,511
[GOU] Not really, it's just
the muscles on those legs

402
00:18:24,594 --> 00:18:26,137
look strangely familiar.

403

Hey, uh... That's Haru.

404
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:31,351
[NAGISA] Right? There,
in the background?

405
00:18:31,434 --> 00:18:33,978
[REI] I think you're right!
That's Haruka for sure!

406
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,814
Oh, and... It's hard
tell at this distance,

407
00:18:35,897 --> 00:18:37,899
but I think I see
Makoto's backpack.

408

[NAGISA]
Yeah, I see it, too!

409

That's whose legs they are!
I'm certain now.

410

I'd know those calves anywhere!

It's Makoto's on that stage!

He's fighting for the
pride of Iwatobi!

[grunting]

416

Huh? What the...?

"baptism of Tokyo."

with Iwatobi than Tokyo though.

That was super cool!

456
00:20:27,467 --> 00:20:29,427
[SOSUKE]
Backstroke for days.

457
00:20:29,511 --> 00:20:31,304
Wait. Sosuke watched it?

458
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:33,223
Do your best in the
next match, too!

459
00:20:33,306 --> 00:20:36,393
[MAKOTO] I was just a sub,
so I won't be in the next match.

460
00:20:36,476 --> 00:20:38,353
Aw, that's disappointing.

461
00:20:38,436 --> 00:20:40,772
Anyway, tell Haru
we all said hi.

462
00:20:40,855 --> 00:20:43,191
[MAKOTO] Will do. Tell everyone
that we said hi, too.

463
00:20:43,274 --> 00:20:44,943
Sure! Buh-bye!

464
00:20:45,026 --> 00:20:47,654
See ya... Ugh...

465
00:20:47,737 --> 00:20:49,823
Oh, yeah. Makoto. Look here.

466
00:20:49,906 --> 00:20:54,577
Huh? The twin organisms Namako
and Senjunamako! No way!

467
00:20:54,661 --> 00:20:56,204
Can't believe you
remembered that.

468
00:20:56,287 --> 00:20:58,456
Well, I've only been
looking for them forever.

469
00:20:58,540 --> 00:20:59,582
Here they are.

470
00:20:59,666 --> 00:21:01,960
Huh? Did you get them for me?

471
00:21:02,043 --> 00:21:05,255
Yeah. You said Ren and
Ran wanted them, right?

472
00:21:06,756 --> 00:21:10,593
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm! This means a lot, Haru.

473
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,137
[HARUKA]
Should we go get our suits?

474
00:21:12,220 --> 00:21:13,555
[MAKOTO]
Sure.

475
00:21:18,893 --> 00:21:20,812
[laughs]

476
00:21:20,895 --> 00:21:24,024
[HIYORI] It's a waste, ya know.
You looked great in that suit.

477
00:21:24,107 --> 00:21:27,527
For real. That was the
one for you, I mean it.

478
00:21:27,610 --> 00:21:29,863
I wanna choose these
things for myself.

479
00:21:29,946 --> 00:21:31,990
[HIYORI]
Do ya have to be stubborn?

480
00:21:32,073 --> 00:21:36,036
Oh, well, that is one of the
things I like about you.

481
00:21:36,119 --> 00:21:37,454
[IKUYA]
What's that mean?

482
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:41,583
[MAKOTO]
Feel like I'm playing dress-up.

483
00:21:41,666 --> 00:21:44,002
It's embarrassing.

484
00:21:44,085 --> 00:21:47,589
I think we've found your suit.
You look so handsome.

485
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,132
Thanks, you really think so?

486
00:21:49,215 --> 00:21:51,468
[curtain clatters]

487
00:21:51,551 --> 00:21:55,930
Wow! You boys make
a dashing pair.

488
00:21:56,014 --> 00:21:57,223
It's so stuffy.

489
00:21:57,307 --> 00:21:59,642
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Haru.

490
00:22:00,727 --> 00:22:01,853
I don't know about you,

491
00:22:01,936 --> 00:22:04,731
but I'm starting to
feel like an adult now.

492
00:22:04,814 --> 00:22:07,108
Same here.

493
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:10,487
[MAKOTO] Even then, I think
we were still just kids,

494
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,615
but the curtain was about to
rise on our college lives.

495
00:22:13,698 --> 00:22:16,910
It's quite the story,
but it's for another time.

496
00:22:21,873 --> 00:22:23,708
[NAGISA] Haru and the
others are finally starting

497
00:22:23,792 --> 00:22:24,626
their new lives!

498
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:26,044
[REI]
Exciting stuff, we know.

499
00:22:26,127 --> 00:22:28,213
[NAGISA] Next time:
"Sprouting Dive Start!"

500
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:29,631
[REI]
Look forward to it!
