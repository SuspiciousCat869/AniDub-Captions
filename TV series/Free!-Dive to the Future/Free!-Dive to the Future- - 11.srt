1
00:00:10,708 --> 00:00:13,166
[REI] Tokyo really is
as crowded as they say.

2
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:14,625
[ROMIO]
Right?

3
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,500
It's always like this around
Hachiko in the summertime.

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,708
But the Moyai statue's a good
place to meet up, too,

5
00:00:18,791 --> 00:00:20,291
if you're trying
to avoid the crowds.

6
00:00:20,375 --> 00:00:23,625
[laughs] I get why you say
Tokyo's your second home--

7
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,541
you could give tours!

8
00:00:24,625 --> 00:00:26,625
[GOU]
This place is great.

9
00:00:26,708 --> 00:00:28,250
[GOU, AYUMU gulp]

10
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:30,083
There're muscles
all over the place!

11
00:00:30,166 --> 00:00:31,208
And more!

12
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:34,291
Wow. Hachiko.

13
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:35,416
[MAKOTO]
Hey!

14
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:37,958
Mako!

15
00:00:38,041 --> 00:00:39,541
Sorry to hold you up!

16
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:41,916
It's fine--we just got here!

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,333
Wait, where's Rei?

18
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:45,541
[NAGISA]
He went to the bathroom.

19
00:00:45,625 --> 00:00:48,166
That's the evil king who
wanted the magic lamp.

20
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:49,750
[MAKOTO]
Hm? Oh.

21
00:00:49,833 --> 00:00:52,333
You guys must be the
new club members.

22
00:00:52,416 --> 00:00:54,250
[ROMIO]
Romio Hayafune!

23
00:00:54,333 --> 00:00:56,166
[AYUMU]
Ayumu Kunikida!

24
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,916
[SHIZURU]
Shizuru Isurugi.

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,166
I've heard a lot
about you three.

26
00:01:00,250 --> 00:01:02,791
Hi, I'm Makoto Tachibana.

27
00:01:02,875 --> 00:01:03,458
Pleasure's mine.

28
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:05,125
[ALL gasp]

29
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:07,916
[ROMIO, AYUMU, SHIZURU]
We're honored to meet you!

30
00:02:39,083 --> 00:02:41,250
[REI] It's such a delight
to catch up with you!

31
00:02:41,333 --> 00:02:43,000
[MAKOTO]
Yeah, long time no see.

32
00:02:43,083 --> 00:02:44,458
How've you been doing?

33
00:02:44,541 --> 00:02:45,875
[REI]
Quite well!

34
00:02:45,958 --> 00:02:48,416
[NAGISA] Haru's at his
training camp today, isn't he?

35
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:49,958
He's been trying to get
more practice in,

36
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,833
since the All-Japan's
almost here.

37
00:02:51,916 --> 00:02:53,416
So the nationals start tomorrow.

38
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:54,583
You feelin' ready?

39
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:55,750
Yes!

40
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:58,666
I'm butterfly and
Nagisa's breaststroke.

41
00:02:58,750 --> 00:03:00,958
It's all so exciting!

42
00:03:01,041 --> 00:03:05,500
[MAKOTO] Mm-hm! Rei. Nagisa.
I'm proud of you guys.

43
00:03:06,625 --> 00:03:08,708
I'm sorry you two
didn't make the cut,

44
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:11,041
but we can still go
cheer on your teammates!

45
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:12,291
[BOTH]
Sir!

46
00:03:12,375 --> 00:03:14,625
[NAGISA] I'm just sad
we couldn't see Haru.

47
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:16,083
[REI]
There's no helping it, Nagisa.

48
00:03:16,166 --> 00:03:18,125
The All-Japan Invitational
is next week,

49
00:03:18,208 --> 00:03:21,125
and that is a pivotal time
in any swimmer's career!

50
00:03:21,208 --> 00:03:22,708
[NAGISA]
I guess you're right.

51
00:03:22,791 --> 00:03:24,458
Didn't you tell us that
your older brother

52
00:03:24,541 --> 00:03:26,291
is doing some
extra training, too?

53
00:03:26,375 --> 00:03:28,041
Yeah, but he and Haruka
are working with

54
00:03:28,125 --> 00:03:29,500
different coaches,
so they aren't going to be

55
00:03:29,583 --> 00:03:31,916
practicing together or anything.

56
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,291
[NAGISA]
Hm.

57
00:03:33,375 --> 00:03:35,500
[REI] It's inspiring to see
everyone working so hard

58
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:36,916
toward their goals.

59
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I suggest we do the same!

60
00:03:39,083 --> 00:03:41,541
And the first step to
that is a good meal!

61
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,666
Let's eat!

62
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,500
[ALL]
Sounds good!

63
00:03:47,541 --> 00:03:51,000
[MIKHAIL] Mm! I can't tell you
how much I love Japanese food!

64
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:53,166
Your muscles appear to be
in excellent condition,

65
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,416
by the way.

66
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:57,125
I feel like sashimi that
found its way to water!

67
00:03:57,208 --> 00:03:58,916
I don't think sashimi
has any business

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,375
in the water, Coach.

69
00:04:00,458 --> 00:04:02,166
[MIKHAIL]
Oh, almost forgot!

70
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:04,166
He's probably on break, too.

71
00:04:08,625 --> 00:04:10,583
Shouldn't you answer that?

72
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,166
[sighs]

73
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:17,125
Yeah, what?

74
00:04:17,208 --> 00:04:18,958
[MIKHAIL]
Ryuuji, finally!

75
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:20,666
How long has it been?

76
00:04:20,750 --> 00:04:22,500
I tried calling you
a million times,

77
00:04:22,583 --> 00:04:23,583
but it wasn't going through.

78
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,166
'Cause I was ignoring you.

79
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:28,333
[laughs] You are as unfriendly
as you've always been, I see!

80
00:04:28,416 --> 00:04:29,750
Listen, I'm busy here.

81
00:04:29,833 --> 00:04:31,958
You mind gettin' to the point?

82
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:34,291
Just want to say I'm in Japan.

83
00:04:34,375 --> 00:04:36,500
I hear you've been coaching
someone who's competing

84
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:38,250
in the All-Japan Invitational.

85
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,250
How do you know about that?

86
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,208
'Cause I know everything
about you, obviously.

87
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,791
But here's the kicker.

88
00:04:44,875 --> 00:04:47,416
I'm also training a swimmer
who's in the All-Japan--

89
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,000
isn't that something?

90
00:04:49,083 --> 00:04:51,791
If we'd seen his rad
muscles back in our day,

91
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,500
he would've given you
a run for your money!

92
00:04:54,583 --> 00:04:55,750
Look, Mikhail.

93
00:04:55,833 --> 00:04:58,500
I've got a quick word
of advice to give you.

94
00:04:58,583 --> 00:04:59,708
What's that?

95
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:02,166
I know that you're a
little behind the times,

96
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,500
but no one says the
word "rad" anymore.

97
00:05:04,583 --> 00:05:06,458
[gasps] Really?

98
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,708
Really, but here's
a phrase that'll

99
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,583
make you sound extra cool.

100
00:05:10,666 --> 00:05:13,583
You should say "I'm totes
hip with the kids, yo!"

101
00:05:13,666 --> 00:05:17,208
"Totes hip with the kids,"
I think I can do that.

102
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,750
You're the best, Ryuuji!

103
00:05:18,833 --> 00:05:21,958
I'll be sure to master it
before the All-Japan Invi--

104
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:24,833
That one of your friends?

105
00:05:24,916 --> 00:05:26,875
More like a fungus that
I've been stuck with

106
00:05:26,958 --> 00:05:28,041
since high school.

107
00:05:28,125 --> 00:05:29,791
Someone from Iwatobi?

108
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:31,250
Nah, different school.

109
00:05:31,333 --> 00:05:34,375
We met each other competing
at the nationals one year.

110
00:05:34,458 --> 00:05:35,666
He's actually Russian,

111
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:37,541
but he was living
here at the time.

112
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,916
Now that I think about it,
the high school nationals

113
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,750
will be starting tomorrow.
Isn't Iwatobi going?

114
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,041
[gasps]

115
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,875
[REI]
What a lovely meal!

116
00:05:50,958 --> 00:05:53,125
[MAKOTO] Sorry, everyone.
I gotta get goin'.

117
00:05:53,208 --> 00:05:55,625
My shift starts soon,
and I don't wanna be late.

118
00:05:55,708 --> 00:05:58,041
But, this has been fun!

119
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,250
Besides your classes,

120
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,458
you're also coaching
at a swim club. Right?

121
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,541
Yeah. Oh, hey! Since
you guys are here,

122
00:06:03,625 --> 00:06:05,416
why don't you come
by for a swim?

123
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:06,500
[ALL gasp]

124
00:06:06,583 --> 00:06:08,458
Sure thing!

125
00:06:08,541 --> 00:06:09,666
[gasps]

126
00:06:11,875 --> 00:06:14,041
[MAKOTO]
Romio and Shizuru.

127
00:06:14,125 --> 00:06:16,958
They have opposite styles,
but they're equally good.

128
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:19,291
If they keep on improving,
then I think they'll

129
00:06:19,375 --> 00:06:21,708
both be going places
by next year.

130
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:23,666
Yeah, Romio's been
regularly attending

131
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:26,583
a swimming club ever since
he was in elementary school.

132
00:06:26,666 --> 00:06:28,666
And Shizu kinda does
things his own way,

133
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:30,666
but he's got natural talent!

134
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:34,666
I can't wait to see
how far they go.

135
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,625
[REI]
I agree. They're inspiring!

136
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:39,625
[NAGISA laughs]
You said it!

137
00:06:39,708 --> 00:06:41,500
So, you are ready, Rei?

138
00:06:41,583 --> 00:06:44,125
Of course! It's my first
time at the nationals.

139
00:06:44,208 --> 00:06:45,708
I could not be readier!

140
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:47,500
Yeah, he's been
training really hard.

141
00:06:47,583 --> 00:06:49,166
We're so proud of him!

142
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:51,791
I appreciate your
support, Nagisa.

143
00:06:51,875 --> 00:06:54,291
The Iwatobi Swim Club has
accomplished quite a lot

144
00:06:54,375 --> 00:06:55,625
during the last three years.

145
00:06:55,708 --> 00:06:57,500
Let's show them what we've got!

146
00:06:57,583 --> 00:06:59,000
[NAGISA]
Mm-hm!

147
00:06:59,083 --> 00:07:02,041
[REI] I'm kind of nervous,
but I have faith in our team.

148
00:07:02,125 --> 00:07:04,708
All we can do is
our best, right?

149
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,291
[NAGISA] Roger that!
Let's get some practice in!

150
00:07:07,375 --> 00:07:10,791
[GOU] Hold on, Nagisa! You're
supposed to warm up first!

151
00:07:10,875 --> 00:07:12,541
[KON]
How's Nanase doing?

152
00:07:12,625 --> 00:07:14,708
[AZUMA]
Hm? Eh, fine.

153
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,875
[KON] Not too long ago, I wrote
a story about that Kinjou kid,

154
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,416
from Naribusawa.

155
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:22,875
Man, talk about potential.

156
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:24,583
He had already gotten
a lot of buzz

157
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,125
as a butterfly swimmer,
but ever since he switched

158
00:07:27,208 --> 00:07:31,083
to freestyle, he's been
making insane progress.

159
00:07:31,166 --> 00:07:34,041
It's not official or anything,
but during practice yesterday,

160
00:07:34,125 --> 00:07:36,208
the guy beat the
national record.

161
00:07:36,291 --> 00:07:38,958
[AZUMA] Sounds like we've got
another monster on the scene.

162
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,833
I figured you'd be at least
a little interested.

163
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:44,000
So what's the deal?

164
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:46,250
[AZUMA] Yeah, I'm just bored
with swimmers who have

165
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:49,333
nothing to offer outside
of brute strength.

166
00:07:49,416 --> 00:07:50,708
The champs

167
00:07:50,791 --> 00:07:52,458
are the ones who fight
like their lives

168
00:07:52,541 --> 00:07:54,083
are depending on it.

169
00:07:54,166 --> 00:07:56,791
[MOMOTARO]
Yahoo! I can't wait!

170
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,250
[NITORI] Let's give it our best
in there so we can go home

171
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:00,666
with no regrets!

172
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:01,583
[SAMEZUKA SWIMMERS]
Right!

173
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,291
[NAGISA]
Ai! Momo!

174
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,291
Hey!

175
00:08:04,375 --> 00:08:05,625
[MOMOTARO]
It's Gou!

176
00:08:05,708 --> 00:08:08,041
Did you guys come to
check out the venue, too?

177
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:10,250
Yes. This is our last
high school meet,

178
00:08:10,333 --> 00:08:13,291
so we're trying to be as
prepared for it as possible.

179
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:16,291
It was too bad how that relay
at regionals turned out.

180
00:08:16,375 --> 00:08:18,791
Yeah, your swimming
that day was amazing.

181
00:08:18,875 --> 00:08:21,500
Ah! Really? Thank you so much!

182
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:24,166
[SHIZURU]
For you.

183
00:08:24,250 --> 00:08:25,416
Fancy fish?

184
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,083
No way! I want some!

185
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,541
[SHIZURU]
Go ahead.

186
00:08:28,625 --> 00:08:31,041
[UOZUMI] Whoa, sweet! That's
really thoughtful of you!

187
00:08:31,125 --> 00:08:32,500
I guess I'll be
competing against you

188
00:08:32,583 --> 00:08:34,041
in the breaststroke, huh?

189
00:08:34,125 --> 00:08:37,833
That's right, and I hope
you're ready to face me, Nagisa.

190
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:40,333
Because my plan is to apply
everything I've learned

191
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:43,541
in the last three years of
training to this one race.

192
00:08:43,625 --> 00:08:46,458
Oh, I'm ready. Let's go.

193
00:08:46,541 --> 00:08:48,541
[ISUZU]
Momotaro!

194
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:51,458
[gasps] Hey, sis!

195
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,458
Wait, what?

196
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:53,958
Those two are siblings?

197
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:55,958
What are you up to, Momo?

198
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:58,541
Um. Scopin' the place out?

199
00:08:58,625 --> 00:09:01,750
[gasps] You're so cute!

200
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,666
You must be Iwatobi's
famous Gou!

201
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,375
Um, hi?

202
00:09:05,458 --> 00:09:06,958
[ISUZU]
I'm Isuzu Mikoshiba!

203
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,208
It's nice to meet ya.

204
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,333
Both my brothers talk
about you all the time!

205
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,333
Oh. I wonder what they've said.

206
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,583
Aw, come on, sis, Gou
thinks I'm really cool,

207
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:15,833
please don't ruin it!

208
00:09:15,916 --> 00:09:16,750
[ISUZU] Is it true your
brother Rin's muscles

209
00:09:16,833 --> 00:09:18,208
are the stuff of legends?

210
00:09:18,291 --> 00:09:19,625
[GOU gasps]

211
00:09:19,708 --> 00:09:22,458
Are his pecs really so
enormous that he has cleavage?

212
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,750
Can it be you understand?

213
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:26,000
Yes.

214
00:09:26,083 --> 00:09:27,250
Hey, I heard that Nanase's

215
00:09:27,333 --> 00:09:28,750
attending a training
camp right now

216
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:31,291
to get ready for the
All-Japan Invitational.

217
00:09:31,375 --> 00:09:32,833
He is.

218
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,500
So, unfortunately, it seems
highly doubtful he'll be able

219
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,541
to make it here
for tomorrow's races.

220
00:09:36,625 --> 00:09:40,291
I understand. This is a really
important time for him.

221
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,791
And for Rin, too.

222
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,500
I'm sure he's working
extremely hard.

223
00:09:47,333 --> 00:09:48,833
[REI]
Yes, I'm sure.

224
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:54,291
[panting]

225
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,375
[AZUMA]
I think we should call it a day.

226
00:09:59,458 --> 00:10:02,833
See ya. Don't forget
your cooldowns.

227
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,500
Coach Azuma.

228
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:11,875
[phone ringing]

229
00:10:11,958 --> 00:10:13,625
Hey, Haru.

230
00:10:13,708 --> 00:10:16,833
There's somethin' I wanted
to talk to you about.

231
00:10:16,916 --> 00:10:20,625
[HARUKA] Sure. I wanted
to talk to you, too.

232
00:10:23,166 --> 00:10:27,500
[REI] It's finally here.
My last high school summer.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,750
Where'd Rei go?

234
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,625
[AMAKATA]
We meet again, Tokyo.

235
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:36,833
Where there once
was a barren desert,

236
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,750
now stands a city of hope.

237
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:43,000
[SASABE]
Huh? Hey! Nagisa!

238
00:10:43,083 --> 00:10:45,250
Hey, it's Coach!

239
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:47,958
We thought we'd come
and cheer you guys on.

240
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,750
It is your big moment in
the spotlight, after all!

241
00:10:50,833 --> 00:10:54,125
[SASABE laughs]

242
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:57,625
[KISUMI] Don't you think we
got here a little too early?

243
00:10:57,708 --> 00:11:00,333
[laughs] I guess after
that close call last time,

244
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,875
I was worried about
being too late.

245
00:11:01,958 --> 00:11:03,000
I dunno, you guys,

246
00:11:03,083 --> 00:11:05,125
I didn't even go
to that high school.

247
00:11:05,208 --> 00:11:06,708
Come on, don't be like that!

248
00:11:06,791 --> 00:11:09,833
At least you get to spend
time with your friends!

249
00:11:09,916 --> 00:11:12,875
[KISUMI] But, wait, you didn't
go to their high school either.

250
00:11:12,958 --> 00:11:14,458
[ASAHI] I know, but I
wanna cheer on the guys

251
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:16,458
from my old school.

252
00:11:21,166 --> 00:11:23,750
There you are. Come on, get in.

253
00:11:25,625 --> 00:11:28,083
[HARUKA]
Coach Mikhail let you leave?

254
00:11:28,166 --> 00:11:29,500
Sure.

255
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,500
But, look, if this throws
off your condition,

256
00:11:31,583 --> 00:11:33,833
you can't blame me,
you got that?

257
00:11:33,916 --> 00:11:35,416
I'm not that fragile.

258
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:39,750
A single day off isn't
gonna undo everything.

259
00:11:39,833 --> 00:11:41,958
Still pretty cocky, aren't ya?

260
00:11:42,041 --> 00:11:43,666
Same goes for you.

261
00:11:47,375 --> 00:11:49,666
[HARUKA]
Hey, you're driving too fast.

262
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,041
[AZUMA] Damn, it's almost
time for the All-Japan,

263
00:11:54,125 --> 00:11:56,125
and this knucklehead
changes his whole schedule

264
00:11:56,208 --> 00:11:57,833
to go support his old teammates?

265
00:11:57,916 --> 00:11:59,833
Who the hell does that?

266
00:12:02,625 --> 00:12:04,333
[MAKOTO]
Look at all the people!

267
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,833
Guess it's a good thing
we got here early.

268
00:12:07,916 --> 00:12:09,291
[ASAHI]
There they are!

269
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:11,666
Okay, I'll catch up
with you guys later!

270
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:12,708
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm!

271
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:15,083
[NAGISA]
Mako! You're here!

272
00:12:15,166 --> 00:12:16,666
Sure am. Hey, guys.

273
00:12:16,750 --> 00:12:18,416
You're so early!

274
00:12:18,500 --> 00:12:21,541
I know. I couldn't
sleep for some reason.

275
00:12:21,625 --> 00:12:25,166
[NAGISA laughs] That's weird,
you're not even swimming today!

276
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:26,708
[MAKOTO]
Right? I don't get it.

277
00:12:26,791 --> 00:12:29,666
[RIN] So did you tell Rei
and Nagisa you were coming?

278
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:31,000
Nope.

279
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:33,500
Yeah, I haven't told
any of my guys either.

280
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:37,291
Well, this kind of thing is more
fun if it's a surprise, right?

281
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:40,541
Isuzu!

282
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,666
I can't believe there's
another Mikoshiba.

283
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:47,500
She's got some
serious power! Plus...

284
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:48,166
[gasps]

285
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:49,333
[UOZUMI]
She's hot!

286
00:12:49,416 --> 00:12:51,958
Yahoo! That's my sister!

287
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:53,458
That was a great race.

288
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:54,958
Yeah, I know, right?

289
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:56,583
Did you come to see us?

290
00:12:56,666 --> 00:12:57,875
Yeah.

291
00:12:57,958 --> 00:12:59,958
And there's something
I wanna tell you.

292
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:03,416
[KISUMI]
Asahi still isn't back.

293
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,916
Well, I'm sure he
and his old buddies

294
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,750
had a lot of catching up to do.

295
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,666
Hey, where's Rei, though?

296
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,583
He was saying he
needed some fresh air,

297
00:13:10,666 --> 00:13:13,125
so he went outside
for a few minutes.

298
00:13:15,916 --> 00:13:18,333
[ASAHI] You guys look so much
older now, it's crazy!

299
00:13:21,875 --> 00:13:24,500
[INUHIKO]
You okay? What's wrong?

300
00:13:24,583 --> 00:13:26,458
Nothing. I just zoned out.

301
00:13:27,541 --> 00:13:30,666
[RIN]
Damnit! We're so close, too!

302
00:13:30,750 --> 00:13:31,875
Hey, look.

303
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:35,875
[HARUKA]
We can just park in there.

304
00:13:35,958 --> 00:13:38,583
Huh? But, it's way too far!

305
00:13:38,666 --> 00:13:40,666
No, it'll be faster if we run.

306
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:45,583
[laughs] Don't you think this
is a bit dumb for us to do

307
00:13:45,666 --> 00:13:47,250
right before the All-Japan?

308
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,916
It's not dumb. It's just free.

309
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,666
[laughs]

310
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:10,208
This isn't like me.

311
00:14:10,291 --> 00:14:11,666
Okay.

312
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,291
Guess I better get back to
the people I came here with.

313
00:14:14,375 --> 00:14:16,833
I'll text you guys.
See ya later!

314
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:18,166
[KAZAMI SWIMMERS]
Bye!

Hey! Aren't you--?

[ASAHI] I can't believe you
still wear those red glasses!

317
00:14:37,583 --> 00:14:39,500
[REI]
Yes. Hold on.

318
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:41,125
If you're here, that must
mean you've kept up

319
00:14:41,208 --> 00:14:43,916
with swimming all these years!

320
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,125
Well, no. You're in
street clothes, so.

321
00:14:47,208 --> 00:14:48,708
You're here to watch?

322
00:14:48,791 --> 00:14:49,875
Uh-huh!

323
00:14:49,958 --> 00:14:51,750
I gotta support my
high school team, right?

324
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:53,791
I just started my
first year of college.

325
00:14:53,875 --> 00:14:56,000
And yup, I'm still a swimmer!

326
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:00,458
I'm gonna compete in
the butterfly race myself.

327
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,958
[ASAHI] Whoa! No kidding?
That's awesome!

328
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,541
I didn't even make it to
the nationals in high school!

329
00:15:05,625 --> 00:15:07,291
So I'm guessing that's
the reason you look like

330
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:09,041
you're about to throw up, huh?

331
00:15:09,125 --> 00:15:12,000
Uh-- I'm not nervous!

332
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:13,750
There are a lot of ways
to prepare yourself

333
00:15:13,833 --> 00:15:16,208
mentally for this kind of stuff.

334
00:15:16,291 --> 00:15:18,708
But try not to think
about it too much, okay?

335
00:15:19,875 --> 00:15:21,458
[ASAHI]
Victory's tricky.

336
00:15:21,541 --> 00:15:23,333
You just gotta make or break it!

337
00:15:23,416 --> 00:15:25,583
I don't wanna break
anything, though.

338

[ASAHI laughs]
It's a figure of speech.

339
00:15:27,916 --> 00:15:30,666
My point is, part of
winning is always luck,

340
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:32,250
and it seems like you've
got some of the best

I mean look, here we are,
after all this time.

And we ran into each other
today, of all days.

That's true.

345
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:46,208
Maybe you have a point there.

Hey, forget the maybe!
