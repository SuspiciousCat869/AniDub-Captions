00:00:48,204 --> 00:00:50,165
I'll be right there!

8
00:00:51,166 --> 00:00:55,920
[HIYORI] When I was a little
kid, I was alone all the time.

[MOM 6A] Aw, are you
by yourself, Hiyo?

13
00:01:06,348 --> 00:01:09,059
[HIYORI]
Really, I hated being alone.

14
00:01:09,142 --> 00:01:11,853

It turns out your
father and I both

have to work again
this Sunday. Sorry.

I'll be okay, Mom!

19
00:01:21,738 --> 00:01:24,741
[HIYORI]
I had to keep on smiling.

20
00:01:24,824 --> 00:01:27,827
I needed to be the kind
of kid grown-ups liked.

21
00:01:29,329 --> 00:01:30,997
[HIYORI] So I tried to
act the way I thought

22
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:32,624
they would want me to.

23
00:01:35,335 --> 00:01:37,003
[HIYORI]
Anytime I was around people,

24
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:40,674
I was focused on playing a part.

25
00:01:40,757 --> 00:01:44,344
But, whenever I was in the
water, those were the times

26
00:01:44,427 --> 00:01:46,638
I felt the most like myself.

I first met Ikuya.

Hey. You're really good
at swimming, aren't you?

Uh, thank you.

Do you wanna swim together?

Uh!

Sure!

00:02:11,246 --> 00:02:12,664
[HIYORI]
That was the day when I learned

37
00:02:12,747 --> 00:02:15,583
how to smile for real again.

00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,971

Kirishima, up for some karaoke?

You still haven't heard
my awesome singing!

44
00:04:07,779 --> 00:04:10,615
Yeah, right! It's more
like dancing and yodeling!

He's all, "yo-de-lay-hee-hoo!"

You think that's cool.

Amazing!

00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:19,124
So? You coming?

No thanks. I'm kinda busy today.

I see you're not just
a backstroke swimmer.

00:04:26,923 --> 00:04:29,134
Your 50-meter free's
improved, too.

Sorry, Captain.

[HIYORI]
Hold on, Ikuya!

58
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:41,646
[IKUYA]
I know it's stupid to get mad

59
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:44,441
just because my time got worse.

60
00:04:44,524 --> 00:04:47,485
But I can't let anyone
see me acting so weak.

61
00:04:47,569 --> 00:04:49,487
I have to get stronger.

62
00:04:50,488 --> 00:04:53,491
You're still obsessing
over Nanase, aren't you?

63
00:04:53,575 --> 00:04:55,285
It's not hard to figure
out why you've been

64
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:57,412
struggling in freestyle.

65
00:05:02,125 --> 00:05:04,753
I've told you about
all this before.

66
00:05:04,836 --> 00:05:08,798
In middle school, when I had
that accident during practice.

67
00:05:08,882 --> 00:05:12,302
Haru came to save
me just in time.

68
00:05:12,385 --> 00:05:13,762
But then,

69
00:05:13,845 --> 00:05:17,557
I got really upset when he
quit and the team split up.

70
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,728
[IKUYA] I guess I decided
to keep swimming because...

71
00:05:21,811 --> 00:05:24,230
...I just couldn't stand still.

72
00:05:24,314 --> 00:05:29,319
I really believed, if I gave
him some time, he'd come back.

73
00:05:29,402 --> 00:05:31,780
Then I went to America.

74
00:05:31,863 --> 00:05:34,908
And, well... You know
what happened.

75
00:05:36,326 --> 00:05:38,870
[IKUYA] As I sank through
the water all alone,

76
00:05:38,953 --> 00:05:42,916
I thought, "Wow.
Haru's gone for good."

77
00:05:44,876 --> 00:05:46,461
[IKUYA]
And that wasn't all.

78
00:05:46,544 --> 00:05:48,338
I realized how weak
I was for relying

79
00:05:48,421 --> 00:05:51,424
on my brother and my
teammates all the time.

80
00:05:51,508 --> 00:05:53,218
That I'm the only person
who has the power

81
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:55,095
to make myself stronger.

82
00:05:57,847 --> 00:06:00,600
[IKUYA]
I had to do it all alone.

83
00:06:00,684 --> 00:06:03,853
But then, when I saw him again,

84
00:06:03,937 --> 00:06:05,522
the weakness I thought
I left behind

85
00:06:05,605 --> 00:06:07,399
came flooding back to me.

86
00:06:09,734 --> 00:06:11,111
[IKUYA]
And I just can't allow myself

87
00:06:11,194 --> 00:06:16,032
to be that vulnerable right now.

161
00:10:06,179 --> 00:10:07,472
How long have you
been coaching here?

162
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:09,849
It's my first day.

163
00:10:09,933 --> 00:10:11,893
It all started
during spring break,

164
00:10:11,976 --> 00:10:13,395
when I met that
little guy on a trip

165
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,814
to pick out Haru's apartment.

166
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:17,399
He's serious about swimming.

167
00:10:17,482 --> 00:10:20,151
I wanted to help out
more kids like that.

168
00:10:20,235 --> 00:10:22,779
So, you're both goin'
to school here in Tokyo?

169
00:10:22,862 --> 00:10:24,614
Yep! Asahi, too.

170
00:10:24,698 --> 00:10:26,032
They're at Hidaka though.

171
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:28,785
You're all together
again--that's wonderful!

172
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:30,995
I take it the two of them
are still swimming, as well?

173
00:10:31,079 --> 00:10:33,915
[MAKOTO]
Mm! Yeah. They are.

174
00:10:33,998 --> 00:10:36,292
But I'm in the sports
education department.

175
00:10:36,376 --> 00:10:37,752
So I don't swim much.

176
00:10:37,836 --> 00:10:40,005
Oh. Then you and I are similar.

177
00:10:40,088 --> 00:10:42,674
I've been majoring
in sports medicine.

178
00:10:42,757 --> 00:10:45,218
I want a job where I can
support other swimmers,

179
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:47,303
so I'm working to
become a trainer.

180
00:10:54,019 --> 00:10:57,063
[NAO] Oh, wow! You three
really have grown up!

181
00:10:57,147 --> 00:10:59,441
You look like you're
a lot tougher now.

182
00:10:59,524 --> 00:11:01,067
How've you been?

183
00:11:01,151 --> 00:11:02,569
Not too bad.

184
00:11:02,652 --> 00:11:04,195
[AKANE]
I hear you were Asahi's manager

185
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:05,905
when he was in middle school.

186
00:11:05,989 --> 00:11:08,450
I sure hope he didn't cause
you too much trouble.

187
00:11:08,533 --> 00:11:11,453
Cut it out! Stop
treating me like a baby!

188
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:13,163
Still a little on the
sensitive side, huh?

189
00:11:13,246 --> 00:11:15,749
[ASAHI] Aw! Jeez,
leave it alone, already!

190
00:11:15,832 --> 00:11:19,377
[laughs] What's
Ikuya been up to?

191
00:11:19,461 --> 00:11:20,879
Have you kept in touch?

192
00:11:23,131 --> 00:11:25,175
[NAO] Natsuya says he's
back from America,

193
00:11:25,258 --> 00:11:27,135
going to college in Tokyo.

194
00:11:27,218 --> 00:11:30,680
[MAKOTO] Yeah, he's at
Shimogami University now.

195
00:11:30,764 --> 00:11:33,850
Actually, we just saw him
for the first time in years

196
00:11:33,933 --> 00:11:35,352
at a newcomer tournament.

197
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:37,187
Oh, that's great!

198
00:11:39,314 --> 00:11:40,648
Isn't it?

199
00:11:40,732 --> 00:11:44,486
I guess, but it seems he's
not doing so great lately.

200
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:46,071
[NAO]
What happened?

201
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,200
It was my fault.

202
00:11:52,285 --> 00:11:54,829
That's what Ikuya's
teammate said, at least.

203
00:11:54,913 --> 00:11:58,291
People I swim with always
seem to end up suffering.

204
00:11:58,375 --> 00:11:59,417
Oh...

205
00:11:59,501 --> 00:12:01,711
Man! That's such a load of crap!

206
00:12:01,795 --> 00:12:03,088
Makoto and I have swum with you

207
00:12:03,171 --> 00:12:04,964
and you don't see us
suffering, do ya?

208
00:12:05,048 --> 00:12:06,633
[MAKOTO chuckles]

209
00:12:06,716 --> 00:12:08,218
We wanna make this right.

210
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:09,969
But we're not sure how.

211
00:12:12,222 --> 00:12:14,599
Can't you just talk to him?

212
00:12:14,683 --> 00:12:16,393
Well, Toono--

213
00:12:16,476 --> 00:12:18,603
That's the teammate
we mentioned.

214
00:12:18,687 --> 00:12:21,606
It seems he doesn't want
Ikuya anywhere near Haru.

215
00:12:21,690 --> 00:12:23,900
I see. Okay, then.

216
00:12:23,983 --> 00:12:26,611
I'll see what Natsuya
can tell me.

217
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:29,739
But still. Based on
everything you just told me,

218
00:12:29,823 --> 00:12:31,491
I feel like there's
more you guys can do

219
00:12:31,574 --> 00:12:33,993
to improve the situation.

220
00:12:34,077 --> 00:12:35,578
[gasps]

221
00:12:35,662 --> 00:12:39,457
[NAO] Just my opinion as
your former teammate. 'Kay?

222
00:12:42,293 --> 00:12:43,420
[HARUKA, ASAHI, MAKOTO]
Right.

223
00:12:44,963 --> 00:12:48,174
[HIYORI]
Look, I found a great café.

224
00:12:48,258 --> 00:12:49,426
[IKUYA]
Yeah, colorful.

225
00:12:49,509 --> 00:12:51,344
Let's go on the way home.

226
00:12:52,804 --> 00:12:56,016
[IKUYA] Sorry. I'm not
in the mood today.

227
00:12:56,099 --> 00:12:57,350
That's fine.

228
00:12:57,434 --> 00:12:59,769
It'll still be there whenever
you feel up to it.

229
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:02,731
[IKUYA]
Hm.

230
00:13:03,982 --> 00:13:05,734
[HIYORI]
Hey, didn't the little mermaid

231
00:13:05,817 --> 00:13:08,153
turn into seafoam at the end?

232
00:13:10,363 --> 00:13:13,033
You know, in that story
you like so much.

233
00:13:16,369 --> 00:13:19,497
I'm not too fond
of it, actually.

234
00:13:20,999 --> 00:13:22,792
She stayed right by
the prince's side

235
00:13:22,876 --> 00:13:25,086
throughout everything,
and yet...

236
00:13:28,506 --> 00:13:30,133
Hey, something wrong?

237
00:13:32,844 --> 00:13:34,346
Of course not.

238
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,517
[ASAHI]
So good!

239
00:13:40,977 --> 00:13:42,145
What gives?

240
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:43,688
Is it National No-Mackerel Day?

241
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,231
That's not a thing.

242
00:13:45,315 --> 00:13:48,151
[AZUMA] What'd I tell you
knuckleheads about mackerel?

243
00:13:48,234 --> 00:13:53,031
Listen up. The hot dish
here is <i>Tanuki</i> soba.

244
00:13:53,114 --> 00:13:54,449
This guy again?

245
00:13:54,532 --> 00:13:56,534
What, are you some
kinda cafeteria foodie?

246
00:13:56,618 --> 00:13:59,871
Yup. Got a blog and everything.

247
00:13:59,954 --> 00:14:01,873
[ASAHI]
Sorry I asked.

248
00:14:01,956 --> 00:14:04,334
[AZUMA]
Hey, you. Remember a while back,

249
00:14:04,417 --> 00:14:08,046
I wanted to know why
you only swim free.

250
00:14:08,129 --> 00:14:09,881
Got an answer for me yet?

251
00:14:13,218 --> 00:14:14,928
Unless you discover
it for yourself,

252
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:17,847
your potential's gonna
stay locked up forever.

253
00:14:19,891 --> 00:14:22,268
You still haven't
told us who you are.

254
00:14:22,352 --> 00:14:25,438
[ASAHI] You're not just
a food critic, are you?

255
00:14:25,522 --> 00:14:28,817
Right now, all I wanna do is
get my blog ranking higher.

256
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:31,403
Be sure to click the heart
button if you like my stuff.

257
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:35,657
I'm not "hearting"
anything for you!

258
00:14:36,950 --> 00:14:38,410
[KON]
Hey, Asahi.

259
00:14:38,493 --> 00:14:40,286
What's up, Kon?

260
00:14:40,370 --> 00:14:42,580
Hey, Haru, this is
my sister's husband.

261
00:14:42,664 --> 00:14:44,249
The sports journalist
I told you about.

262
00:14:44,332 --> 00:14:47,168
Kon Kurimiya.

263
00:14:47,252 --> 00:14:48,044
Working?

264
00:14:48,128 --> 00:14:49,963
Kinda-sorta.

265
00:14:51,589 --> 00:14:54,676
Hey, uh. How do you know Ryuuji?

266
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:56,052
Wait, who's Ryuuji?

267
00:14:56,136 --> 00:14:58,722
Oh! That old guy with the coat?

268
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:01,099
Well yeah, he's...

269
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,267
[MIKHAIL]
I can't get over how many

270
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:04,519
great Japanese
proverbs there are!

271
00:15:04,602 --> 00:15:06,396
Like, "Time is muscle!"

272
00:15:06,479 --> 00:15:07,564
Ooh! And, uh...

273
00:15:07,647 --> 00:15:10,442
"One day, your muscles
won't be around!"

274
00:15:10,525 --> 00:15:12,819
And "Muscle is the key
to every door."

275
00:15:12,902 --> 00:15:14,863
Which one is your
favorite, Rin- <i>kun</i> ?

276
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:16,781
[RIN] Uh, I don't
have a preference.

277
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:18,241
Rin- <i>kun</i> . Please.

278
00:15:18,324 --> 00:15:19,868
They say, "Those who
laugh at muscle

279
00:15:19,951 --> 00:15:21,661
will one day cry over muscle."

280
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:23,038
[gasps]

281
00:15:25,874 --> 00:15:27,167
[RIN]
Who is that?

282
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:28,418
[MIKHAIL]
Well, now!

283
00:15:28,501 --> 00:15:29,878
Looks like they're
watching a video

284
00:15:29,961 --> 00:15:32,380
of one of my high
school tournaments.

285
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,007
No way.

286
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,383
[MIKHAIL]
What's this?

287
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:37,969
Could it be that you're
captivated by my impressive

288
00:15:38,053 --> 00:15:39,929
muscles I had back in my prime?

289
00:15:40,013 --> 00:15:42,182
[RIN]
Those strokes are really bold!

290
00:15:42,265 --> 00:15:43,975
[MIKHAIL]
You think <i>I</i> was powerful--

291
00:15:44,059 --> 00:15:45,894
look at the fellow
swimming next to me.

292
00:15:45,977 --> 00:15:47,270
[KON]
That's Ryuuji.

293
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:49,272
Actually, they used to call
him "Fully-Built Ryuuji"

294
00:15:49,356 --> 00:15:51,816
in those days.
An unbelievable swimmer,

295
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,778
he had insane competitive
talent at the global level.

296
00:15:54,861 --> 00:15:56,237
That old geezer?

297
00:15:56,321 --> 00:15:58,239
[KON] Yeah, but he gave up
competitive swimming

298
00:15:58,323 --> 00:16:00,658
out of nowhere for some reason.

299
00:16:00,742 --> 00:16:03,870
I heard he was coaching
overseas after his retirement.

300
00:16:03,953 --> 00:16:05,288
All the swimmers who
train under him

301
00:16:05,372 --> 00:16:07,916
tend to pile on a ton of muscle.

302
00:16:07,999 --> 00:16:09,584
So now people have
taken to calling him

303
00:16:09,668 --> 00:16:12,295
"Pile-It-On Ryuuji."

304
00:16:12,379 --> 00:16:14,881
The rumors said he
was back in Japan.

305
00:16:14,964 --> 00:16:18,218
I wonder if he's planning
to work as a coach here, too?

306
00:16:20,929 --> 00:16:22,389
[NATSUYA]
It's been a while.

307
00:16:23,431 --> 00:16:25,225
I'm back in Japan
for a little bit.

308
00:16:25,308 --> 00:16:27,018
[HIYORI]
Oh, that's good to hear.

309
00:16:29,604 --> 00:16:31,231
[NATSUYA]
How's Ikuya doing?

310
00:16:31,314 --> 00:16:32,190
[HIYORI gasps]

311
00:16:32,273 --> 00:16:33,441
I tried calling his phone,

312
00:16:33,525 --> 00:16:35,610
but I'm having a hard
time getting through.

313
00:16:35,694 --> 00:16:39,698
[HIYORI] Well, he's upset that
his time's not improving.

314
00:16:39,781 --> 00:16:40,824
[NATSUYA]
Is it worse?

315
00:16:40,907 --> 00:16:42,283
It's nothin' to worry about.

316
00:16:42,367 --> 00:16:47,038
If I know him, he'll bounce
back from this in no time.

317
00:16:47,122 --> 00:16:48,665
He just missed
your calls because

318
00:16:48,748 --> 00:16:51,126
he's focusing on
training, I guess.

319
00:16:51,209 --> 00:16:53,253
[NATSUYA]
Probably.

320
00:16:53,336 --> 00:16:54,629
He always has been
the type to forget

321
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:56,965
about what's going
on around him.

322
00:16:57,048 --> 00:17:02,595
Just make sure he doesn't
push himself too hard, okay?

323
00:17:02,679 --> 00:17:05,598
I can't go through that again.

324
00:17:05,682 --> 00:17:06,975
Sure.

325
00:17:08,268 --> 00:17:10,562
[MISAKI]
Wow, this looks yummy!

326
00:17:10,645 --> 00:17:12,355
College must be so awesome!

327
00:17:12,439 --> 00:17:15,650
[laughs] So he wasn't
just a cafeteria critic.

328
00:17:15,734 --> 00:17:17,610
He used to swim competitively?

329
00:17:20,155 --> 00:17:21,656
Uh, Haru?

330
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:25,910
[HARUKA] He asked why I refuse
to swim anything but free,

331
00:17:25,994 --> 00:17:28,329
and I still haven't
stopped thinking about it.

332
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:32,334
I just... I don't
know how to answer.

333
00:17:32,417 --> 00:17:34,002
Tricky.

334
00:17:35,670 --> 00:17:37,964
[MISAKI] Then you should
start swimming other stuff.

335
00:17:38,048 --> 00:17:39,341
[gasps]

336
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:41,885
[MAKOTO gasps]

337
00:17:41,968 --> 00:17:44,095
Uh-- What'd I say?

338
00:17:50,226 --> 00:17:51,644
[HIYORI]
All his strokes are worse.

339
00:17:51,728 --> 00:17:54,105
Back, butterfly,
even his breaststroke,

340
00:17:54,189 --> 00:17:56,107
and that's his best one!

341
00:17:56,191 --> 00:18:00,236
But... especially freestyle.

342
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,199
[KON] Why do you think Ryuuji
was roaming around Hidaka U?

343
00:18:04,282 --> 00:18:06,326
[AKANE]
He's a coach, right?

344
00:18:06,409 --> 00:18:09,371
If you ask me,
he found a prospect.

345
00:18:09,454 --> 00:18:10,205
[KON]
Hm.

346
00:18:10,288 --> 00:18:11,581
[doorbell chimes]

347
00:18:11,664 --> 00:18:13,541
Hello, sir, welcome in.

348
00:18:15,335 --> 00:18:17,253
Well, speak of the devil.

349
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:26,262
[gasps]

350
00:18:35,730 --> 00:18:37,774
[HIYORI]
Ikuya?

351
00:18:37,857 --> 00:18:39,192
You okay?

352
00:18:41,736 --> 00:18:43,613
I can't see the stars.

353
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,871
[IKUYA]
I could see them that night.

354
00:18:54,582 --> 00:19:00,046
[IKUYA]
By the pool. Haru and me.

355
00:19:00,130 --> 00:19:03,049
In the sky, in the water.

356
00:19:03,133 --> 00:19:05,176
As we made that
promise together.

357
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:07,554
Stars were falling everywhere.

358
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,934
[IKUYA] I felt like
my wish would come true.

359
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:15,228
Like I had been set free.

360
00:19:16,646 --> 00:19:19,107
[IKUYA]
But, I was wrong.

361
00:19:19,190 --> 00:19:21,359
I was as weak as I ever was.

362
00:19:22,902 --> 00:19:24,988
I told you, you're not.

363
00:19:25,071 --> 00:19:26,740
I know if I sink again,
there won't be

364
00:19:26,823 --> 00:19:29,075
anyone there to rescue me.

365
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,704
Which is why it's up to me
to make myself stronger.

366
00:19:32,787 --> 00:19:35,331
And why I trained so hard.

367
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:38,001
You have the skill
to take on the world.

368
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:41,129
To compete globally!

369
00:19:41,212 --> 00:19:44,841
[IKUYA]
That's not true. I'm a weakling.

370
00:19:44,924 --> 00:19:46,051
[HIYORI]
No, you're wrong!

371
00:19:46,134 --> 00:19:48,887
You're a lot stronger
than you were!

372
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:52,432
You can become everything
that you wanna be--I know it!

373
00:19:52,515 --> 00:19:55,769
To make your wish come true,
you don't need shooting stars!

374
00:19:59,689 --> 00:20:01,316
[IKUYA] "In exchange
for her lovely voice,

375
00:20:01,399 --> 00:20:06,571
the little mermaid gained legs,
and excruciating pain."

376
00:20:06,654 --> 00:20:10,241
I traded away my heart
to gain strength.

377
00:20:10,325 --> 00:20:12,494
Or so I thought.

378
00:20:12,577 --> 00:20:16,748
But, I still didn't
get to be human.

379
00:20:17,874 --> 00:20:21,127
[HIYORI] Stop it! You're not
the little mermaid, Ikuya!

380
00:20:21,211 --> 00:20:22,212
I should just accept

381
00:20:22,295 --> 00:20:25,215
that I'll never be
strong like Haru.

382
00:20:26,591 --> 00:20:27,425
[IKUYA gasps]

383
00:20:40,146 --> 00:20:43,149
Would you forget about
Nanase already?

384
00:20:43,233 --> 00:20:45,860
I can't bear to see you
suffering because of him.

385
00:20:45,944 --> 00:20:48,822
I won't tolerate it!

386
00:20:48,905 --> 00:20:51,533
What I choose to think
about is my decision.

387
00:20:51,616 --> 00:20:54,994
You could be in
worldwide competition.

388
00:20:55,078 --> 00:20:59,040
I know you can! You can
become a whole new you!

389
00:20:59,124 --> 00:21:01,209
And if that'll make you
happy, then I'll do any--

390
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,795
[IKUYA] Shut up! You don't
understand at all!

391
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,088
Don't act like you do!

392
00:21:05,171 --> 00:21:06,172
[HIYORI grunts]

393
00:21:14,472 --> 00:21:17,058
[HIYORI]
You're not yourself anymore.

394
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:20,145
Not since you saw him.

395
00:21:20,228 --> 00:21:23,982
I wish you'd just get him
out of your life for good.

396
00:21:24,065 --> 00:21:28,361
Ikuya. You're the
one who's confused!

397
00:21:28,445 --> 00:21:30,196
Why can't you see that
the best thing for you

398
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:31,865
is to let him go?!

399
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:36,286
Look. It's none of your
damn business, okay?!

400
00:21:36,369 --> 00:21:37,746
[HIYORI gasps]

401
00:21:48,298 --> 00:21:49,424
Sorry.

402
00:21:57,515 --> 00:21:59,017
Ikuya...

403
00:22:04,773 --> 00:22:06,941
Here he is, workin' hard.

404
00:22:21,539 --> 00:22:23,833
[REI] We seek strength because
we need to feel safe.

405
00:22:23,917 --> 00:22:25,835
[NAGISA] But sometimes,
strength becomes weakness.

406
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,545
[REI] Next time:
"A Solitary Medley!"

407
00:22:27,629 --> 00:22:29,589
[NAGISA]
Time for a tournament!
