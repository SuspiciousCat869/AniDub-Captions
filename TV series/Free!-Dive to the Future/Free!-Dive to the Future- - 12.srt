1
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,599
[ROMIO]
Shizuru, milk or orange juice?

2
00:01:49,683 --> 00:01:51,017
[SHIZURU]
Milk in the mornings.

3
00:01:51,101 --> 00:01:52,185
[ROMIO]
Do we have enough cups?

4
00:01:52,268 --> 00:01:53,561
[NAGISA]
Here's a measuring cup!

5
00:01:53,645 --> 00:01:56,356
[MAKOTO chuckles]
Whoa, not so fast!

6
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:58,191
[NAGISA]
Huh? That's crazy!

7
00:01:58,274 --> 00:01:59,067
[MAKOTO]
It's true.

8
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,443
Incredible!

9
00:02:00,527 --> 00:02:01,986
You're saying it was
Haruka's first time swimming,

10
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,447
and he swam crawl without
even being taught how?

11
00:02:04,531 --> 00:02:05,657
That's what happened.

12
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:07,575
A full 25 meters!

13
00:02:07,659 --> 00:02:08,827
[ROMIO, REI, NAGISA, SHIZURU]
Huh?!

14
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,161
[MAKOTO]
Everyone was blown away,

15
00:02:10,245 --> 00:02:11,621
even the swimming teacher.

16
00:02:11,705 --> 00:02:13,581
It caused a pretty
big commotion.

17
00:02:13,665 --> 00:02:15,333
[REI]
He hadn't even started school!

18
00:02:15,417 --> 00:02:16,501
No way!

19
00:02:16,584 --> 00:02:18,962
How come I never heard
that story before?

20
00:02:19,045 --> 00:02:20,714
[MAKOTO]
I thought I mentioned it.

21
00:02:20,797 --> 00:02:22,173
[REI]
How very shocking!

22
00:02:22,257 --> 00:02:23,383
So, yeah.

23
00:02:23,466 --> 00:02:25,135
Haru's been swimming
only freestyle

24
00:02:25,218 --> 00:02:27,220
for basically his entire life.

25
00:02:27,303 --> 00:02:29,222
[NAGISA]
Sounds like him!

26
00:02:29,305 --> 00:02:30,932
[MAKOTO]
Well, dig in.

27
00:02:31,016 --> 00:02:33,143
[ROMIO]
You're such a good cook!

28
00:02:33,226 --> 00:02:34,936
[NAGISA] The toast is
kinda burnt, though.

29
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,229
[MAKOTO laughs]

30
00:02:36,312 --> 00:02:37,439
[SHIZURU]
Are there salad bowls?

31
00:02:37,522 --> 00:02:39,107
[MAKOTO]
Just use your plate.

32
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,358
This is it, you guys!

33
00:02:40,442 --> 00:02:42,527
The first day of the All-Japan!

34
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,280
[MAKOTO] Mm-hm! We should head
out after we're finished eating.

35
00:02:45,363 --> 00:02:47,824
I can't wait to see
Chappy's mysterious master

36
00:02:47,907 --> 00:02:48,783
swim in person!

37
00:02:48,867 --> 00:02:49,743
Should be fun!

38
00:02:49,826 --> 00:02:50,785
[ROMIO]
I'm ready!

39
00:02:50,869 --> 00:02:51,953
[NAGISA]
It's not just Haru though--

40
00:02:52,037 --> 00:02:53,663
a bunch of his friends'll
be there, too!

41
00:02:53,747 --> 00:02:54,664
Plus Rin!

42
00:02:54,748 --> 00:02:55,915
This is a chance
for us to see some

43
00:02:55,999 --> 00:02:57,000
of the greatest swimmers...

44
00:02:57,083 --> 00:02:59,878
[MAKOTO]
You've come really far, Haru.

45
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,509
[AZUMA] Well, you startin'
to get nervous?

46
00:03:08,553 --> 00:03:10,388
[HARUKA]
Not really.

47
00:03:10,472 --> 00:03:13,183
[AZUMA]
Good answer.

48
00:03:13,266 --> 00:03:15,852
Guess it's that time.

49
00:03:15,935 --> 00:03:17,562
Yeah.

50
00:03:17,645 --> 00:03:20,148
All right. Let's get breakfast.

51
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:23,401
It'll be my treat today.

52
00:03:23,485 --> 00:03:25,236
[MIKHAIL] I mentioned before
that Ryuuji and I have been

53
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:28,073
rivals ever since
high school, right?

54
00:03:28,156 --> 00:03:29,407
Yeah.

55
00:03:29,491 --> 00:03:31,659
[MIKHAIL]
That guy was a prodigy!

56
00:03:31,743 --> 00:03:33,119
Anybody could see
that he was headed

57
00:03:33,203 --> 00:03:35,580
straight for the
top of the world.

58
00:03:35,663 --> 00:03:37,957
"Was"? Did something happen?

59
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:40,710
A few days before the
All-Japan one year,

60
00:03:40,794 --> 00:03:43,630
a close friend of his
got into a bad accident.

61
00:03:43,713 --> 00:03:44,714
[RIN]
Oh.

62
00:03:44,798 --> 00:03:46,091
Ryuuji could've
skipped the tournament

63
00:03:46,174 --> 00:03:48,343
and hurried to his side,
but instead decided to wait

64
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:51,513
till after the race
was over to go see him.

65
00:03:51,596 --> 00:03:53,598
[RIN]
Wow. How'd it go?

66
00:03:53,682 --> 00:03:56,893
Not well. He lost.

67
00:03:56,976 --> 00:04:01,523
It was painful for him to
sacrifice so much, only to fail.

68
00:04:01,606 --> 00:04:05,235
After that, he ended up
retiring from the sport.

69
00:04:05,318 --> 00:04:07,445
Seems like he's still trying
to figure out what's

70
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:09,656
truly important to him
while staying connected

71
00:04:09,739 --> 00:04:11,825
to swimming in some way.

72
00:04:11,908 --> 00:04:14,994
Which would explain
his working with Nanase.

73
00:04:15,078 --> 00:04:17,997
To make sure that he doesn't
make the same mistakes,

74
00:04:18,081 --> 00:04:20,083
or feel the same pain.

75
00:04:23,837 --> 00:04:25,588
[GOU]
Hey, Makoto!

76
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:29,009
Good morning, ladies.

77
00:04:29,092 --> 00:04:30,510
[GROUP]
Same to you guys.

78
00:04:30,593 --> 00:04:32,262
How'd you like Suzu's place?

79
00:04:32,345 --> 00:04:33,680
[ISUZU]
"Suzu"?

80
00:04:33,763 --> 00:04:36,016
It wasn't very restful.
These two wouldn't let me sleep

81
00:04:36,099 --> 00:04:38,184
until they'd converted me
to the muscle fandom.

82
00:04:38,268 --> 00:04:39,519
[ISUZU, GOU giggle]

83
00:04:39,602 --> 00:04:41,521
[MOMOTARO]
Gou!

84
00:04:43,565 --> 00:04:44,858
[NITORI]
Hey, everyone.

85
00:04:44,941 --> 00:04:46,109
--[NAGISA, MAKOTO] Morning!
--[REI] Good to see you.

86
00:04:46,192 --> 00:04:47,318
[MOMOTARO] If I'd known
you were staying there,

87
00:04:47,402 --> 00:04:48,486
I'd've stayed, too!

88
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:50,321
[ISUZU]
Yeah, like I'd let that happen.

89
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,740
[NAGISA]
Are we all here?

90
00:04:51,823 --> 00:04:52,782
[NITORI]
Yup!

91
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,420
You're late, Haru.

92
00:05:47,504 --> 00:05:49,089
You just got here, too.

93
00:05:49,172 --> 00:05:51,508
[laughs] Touché.

94
00:05:56,721 --> 00:05:59,891
[MIKHAIL]
Ryuuji! Hello--

95
00:05:59,974 --> 00:06:01,184
Back off.

96
00:06:01,267 --> 00:06:02,936
[MIKHAIL] Aw, can't you
be happier to see me

97
00:06:03,019 --> 00:06:04,813
after all these years? [laughs]

98
00:06:04,896 --> 00:06:07,607
[AZUMA] Why would I be happy
to see you, muscle-freak?

99
00:06:07,691 --> 00:06:10,568
Wow! You're so quick
with the insults!

100
00:06:10,652 --> 00:06:11,986
[AZUMA]
How long has it been?

101
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:13,613
[MIKHAIL]
Since the tournament in Dubai?

102
00:06:13,697 --> 00:06:14,989
[AZUMA]
Yeah. I think you're right.

103
00:06:15,073 --> 00:06:16,408
[MIKHAIL]
Ah, memories!

104
00:06:16,491 --> 00:06:18,076
[ANNOUNCER 12A] Welcome to
day one of the 86th annual

105
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:21,037
All-Japan Invitational
Swimming Tournament.

106
00:06:21,121 --> 00:06:23,957
We will begin our program
of events momentarily

107
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,460
with a series of
qualifying races.

108
00:06:27,544 --> 00:06:28,628
[RIN]
You ready, Haru?

109
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,671
[CROWD cheering]

110
00:06:29,754 --> 00:06:31,172
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

111
00:06:32,757 --> 00:06:33,842
[NAGISA]
Here we go!

112
00:06:33,925 --> 00:06:35,593
Indeed.

113
00:06:35,677 --> 00:06:37,512
[AMAKATA] So anyone who
beats the base time gets

114
00:06:37,595 --> 00:06:39,347
to go on to the
world championship?

115
00:06:39,431 --> 00:06:41,558
Uh-huh, but it's actually
a whole lot trickier

116
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:42,809
than it sounds.

117
00:06:42,892 --> 00:06:46,104
Only two swimmers can
qualify in each race.

118
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:47,731
This is a totally
different level than

119
00:06:47,814 --> 00:06:49,357
the other tournaments
we've been to.

120
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:50,734
No kidding?

121
00:06:51,818 --> 00:06:54,362
[sighs] So remind me.

122
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:58,950
Today is Haru's 200-meter free,
Rin's 100-meter butterfly,

123
00:06:59,034 --> 00:07:02,495
and Asahi and Toono's
50-meter freestyle, right?

124
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:03,913
Yeah, and don't
forget about Ikuya--

125
00:07:03,997 --> 00:07:05,290
[ANNOUNCER 12A]
The qualifier for the men's

126
00:07:05,373 --> 00:07:07,500
200-meter individual medley
will begin in a moment.

127
00:07:07,584 --> 00:07:10,754
Man, the big day
is finally here.

128
00:07:10,837 --> 00:07:11,796
Sure is.

129
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,091
It's Ikuya...
against his brother!

130
00:07:16,301 --> 00:07:17,135
[NATSUYA laughing]

131
00:07:17,218 --> 00:07:19,220
[IKUYA]
Would you stop laughing?

132
00:07:19,304 --> 00:07:22,557
[NATSUYA] Sorry. I just
never expected this.

133
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,142
Y'know I kinda wish
I could go back

134
00:07:24,225 --> 00:07:25,894
and tell my middle-school self,

135
00:07:25,977 --> 00:07:28,396
"One day, when you're
all grown up,

136
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,650
you're gonna compete in the
All-Japan against your brother."

137
00:07:34,235 --> 00:07:38,615
I wish I could, too.
Wonder if I'd believe me.

138
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:43,953
[NATSUYA]
Don't you dare hold back.

139
00:07:46,748 --> 00:07:49,918
Me, hold back? You wish.

140
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,303
Well, you two, good luck.

141
00:08:01,971 --> 00:08:03,515

Whoa! Natsuya's fast!

144
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:16,444
You got this.

145
00:08:18,071 --> 00:08:21,157
[MAKOTO] Look at that!
Ikuya's closing in on him!

146

[MIKHAIL] Hey, Natsuya's
little brother's got talent!

00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,013
They're even.

It's way too close to call.

up speed this far in?

What's the holdup? We gotta go!

318
00:17:13,106 --> 00:17:14,649
[HIYORI]
We'll be right there!

319
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:15,775
'Kay, See ya.

320
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:17,360
[HIYORI]
Till tomorrow, then.

321
00:17:17,444 --> 00:17:18,778
[ASAHI]
Yup!

322
00:17:18,862 --> 00:17:21,698
Well, I guess I better
be heading home, too.

323
00:17:21,781 --> 00:17:22,574
G'night, guys.

324
00:17:22,657 --> 00:17:24,284
Yeah, have a good one.

325
00:17:24,367 --> 00:17:25,618
[KISUMI]
Bye!

326
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:27,746
[ASAHI] Oh, hey, could you
give me a ride, Kisumi?

327
00:17:29,164 --> 00:17:30,749
So, uh.

328
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,834
[RIN]
There you are.

329
00:17:32,917 --> 00:17:34,169
[MAKOTO]
Rin!

330
00:17:34,252 --> 00:17:37,630
What's up? Are you two
the only ones still here?

331
00:17:37,714 --> 00:17:38,673
Just us.

332
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:40,383
Hey, good job on the butterfly!

333
00:17:40,467 --> 00:17:42,385
Oh, yeah. Thank you.

334
00:17:42,469 --> 00:17:44,387
The way you hung in
there at the very end?

335
00:17:44,471 --> 00:17:45,764
Impressive!

336
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:49,142
[RIN laughs] I'm really worn
out from it now, though.

337
00:17:49,225 --> 00:17:52,354
But, next the real fight begins.

338
00:17:54,856 --> 00:17:56,107
Since we're all here,

339
00:17:56,191 --> 00:17:58,151
what do you say we go
cool off for a little bit?

340
00:17:58,234 --> 00:17:59,486
[RIN]
Eh...

341
00:17:59,569 --> 00:18:02,447
And I know just the
place we should go.

342
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:08,578
[MAKOTO] It's funny, I haven't
been this close to the ocean

343
00:18:08,661 --> 00:18:10,246
since I moved here.

344
00:18:13,249 --> 00:18:16,294
Coach said I'd have to
throw something away.

345
00:18:16,378 --> 00:18:19,422
But I didn't really
wanna do that.

346
00:18:20,674 --> 00:18:23,176
[HARUKA]
And then I lost.

347
00:18:23,259 --> 00:18:26,471
I've been thinking
about it since the race.

348
00:18:26,554 --> 00:18:29,140
Maybe this means
that I don't deserve

349
00:18:29,224 --> 00:18:31,518
to compete internationally.

350
00:18:31,601 --> 00:18:34,479
[RIN, MAKOTO laugh]

351
00:18:34,562 --> 00:18:36,564
What's so funny?

352
00:18:36,648 --> 00:18:37,857
Nothin'.

353
00:18:37,941 --> 00:18:39,359
Just thinkin' about
how even you're

354
00:18:39,442 --> 00:18:40,777
feelin' the pressure now.

355
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:43,571
Seems like this thing's
got you all fired up.

356
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,782
Yeah, you're the reason
we're all here.

357
00:18:45,865 --> 00:18:48,076
Your swimming inspires us.

358
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:50,203
I think the fact that
you're worried about it...

359
00:18:50,286 --> 00:18:51,579
That's your answer.

360
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:52,455
[RIN]
Heh.

361
00:18:52,539 --> 00:18:54,541
I don't get it.

362
00:18:55,959 --> 00:18:58,294
Look, Haru.

363
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:00,588
I've had so many
pressures in life--

364
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,716
I thought they'd crush me.

365
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:05,051
I didn't always
believe in myself.

366
00:19:06,094 --> 00:19:09,639
[RIN] Hah. Guess you
know that, though.

367
00:19:09,723 --> 00:19:12,934
But, after all of our
struggling and butting heads,

368
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:17,230
somehow, we overcame everything
and made it this far.

369
00:19:17,313 --> 00:19:19,816
There's more than one
way to chase a dream.

370
00:19:21,109 --> 00:19:24,612
[RIN] So, I say we face
tomorrow head-on!

371
00:19:24,696 --> 00:19:26,573
That sound good?

372
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:30,785
You know, now that I've
worked with those kids,

373
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:32,912
I know I wanna be a trainer!

374
00:19:32,996 --> 00:19:34,247
[RIN]
Yeah?

375
00:19:34,330 --> 00:19:35,582
[MAKOTO] I've been watching
them go head-to-head

376
00:19:35,665 --> 00:19:37,959
in pursuit of their dreams,
and that showed me

377
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:41,212
that there's a lot more I
wanna do in the future.

378
00:19:41,296 --> 00:19:44,758
I can't wait to see
where life takes me!

379
00:19:44,841 --> 00:19:47,052
So now, my goal is
to help swimmers

380
00:19:47,135 --> 00:19:48,720
who aim for the top.

381
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,973
If I do, maybe that will open
doors for me to teach kids

382
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:54,768
how fun swimming is, too.

383
00:19:54,851 --> 00:19:57,270
Wow, that's a beautiful dream.

384
00:19:57,354 --> 00:19:58,355
And, of course,

385
00:19:58,438 --> 00:20:00,982
I wanna keep supporting
you guys, also.

386
00:20:01,066 --> 00:20:02,692
I mean, what could be cooler

387
00:20:02,776 --> 00:20:05,153
than getting to have more
moments like this again?

388
00:20:05,236 --> 00:20:07,989
[RIN]
Heh. Yeah, I agree.

389
00:20:09,657 --> 00:20:11,409
[RIN]
I'm rootin' for you, Makoto.

390
00:20:11,493 --> 00:20:13,578
[MAKOTO]
I appreciate it.

391
00:20:15,413 --> 00:20:16,414
[MAKOTO, RIN gasp]

392
00:20:16,498 --> 00:20:20,043
[inhales]

393
00:20:20,126 --> 00:20:24,381
[yells]

394
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:28,426
[HARUKA]
Bring it on, world!

395
00:20:31,388 --> 00:20:32,931
[RIN]
Uh-- Haru.

396
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:35,934
[laughs] Come on, Rin,
let's go, too!

397
00:20:36,017 --> 00:20:41,022
Uh-- What is this?
Some kinda teen drama?

398
00:20:41,106 --> 00:20:42,399
Wait up!

399
00:20:44,609 --> 00:20:46,611
[MIKHAIL] There's still a lot
of tight races waiting for them

400
00:20:46,695 --> 00:20:47,821
in this tournament.

401
00:20:47,904 --> 00:20:49,280
Those kids are so young.

402
00:20:49,364 --> 00:20:50,990
The pressure must be enormous.

403
00:20:51,074 --> 00:20:53,159
They just need more
strength of mind.

404
00:20:53,243 --> 00:20:55,704
Dammit. That Nanase.

405
00:20:55,787 --> 00:20:58,748
He was so close to going
to the world championships.

406
00:20:58,832 --> 00:21:00,500
But did you notice?

407
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:01,835
[AZUMA]
Yeah.

408
00:21:01,918 --> 00:21:03,795
I think that bad start
really sapped his strength

409
00:21:03,878 --> 00:21:05,422
at the beginning of the race.

410
00:21:05,505 --> 00:21:07,340
Toward the halfway point,
though, it was clear

411
00:21:07,424 --> 00:21:10,844
that his speed was
greater than Albert's.

412
00:21:10,927 --> 00:21:13,346
[MIKHAIL] But then,
he slowed down at the end.

413
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:15,682
My guess is that
he had his mind

414
00:21:15,765 --> 00:21:19,769
on something else, and it
wasn't Albert or Kinjou.

415
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,022
I think he faltered at
the feeling of surpassing

416
00:21:22,105 --> 00:21:24,065
his limits in freestyle.

417
00:21:24,149 --> 00:21:26,901
That kid's got so much
untapped potential,

418
00:21:26,985 --> 00:21:28,403
it's kinda terrifying.

419
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,989
I think Rin- <i>kun</i> 's right
up there with him, though.

420
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:33,116
[AZUMA]
Hmph! We'll see tomorrow.

421
00:21:33,199 --> 00:21:35,535
He won't stop talking
about stupid crap

422
00:21:35,618 --> 00:21:37,954
like friendship and bonds.

423
00:21:38,038 --> 00:21:39,831
[MIKHAIL]
Times change, Ryuuji.

424
00:21:39,914 --> 00:21:43,001
Who knows what direction
their lives will take next?

425
00:21:52,677 --> 00:21:54,637
[HIYORI]
He beat the base time by a mile.

426
00:21:54,721 --> 00:21:57,640
That's a tournament record
in 100-meter freestyle.

427
00:21:57,724 --> 00:21:59,893
This guy's insane.

428
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:02,354
[ANNOUNCER 12A] Men's 100-meter
freestyle qualifier,

429
00:22:02,437 --> 00:22:03,730
fourth heat.

430
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:09,569
[RIN]
So? How do you feel?

431
00:22:09,652 --> 00:22:11,404
[HARUKA]
I'm surprisingly calm.

432
00:22:11,488 --> 00:22:14,657
[RIN laughs]
I'm psyched.

433
00:22:14,741 --> 00:22:19,245
The whole world's ahead of us.
It's kinda like a dream.

434
00:22:19,329 --> 00:22:22,040
[HARUKA]
No. This is real.

435
00:22:22,123 --> 00:22:24,000
[RIN]
Yeah, you're right.

436
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:27,671
It's so close, we can
reach out and touch it.

437
00:22:27,754 --> 00:22:30,590
Nobody knows what's gonna
happen from here on out.

438
00:22:30,674 --> 00:22:32,008
It's a mystery.

439
00:22:32,092 --> 00:22:35,720
[HARUKA] Whatever's ahead.
I'm ready to face it.

440
00:22:35,804 --> 00:22:39,140
[RIN]
Me, too! It's time to dive.

441
00:22:39,224 --> 00:22:40,475
[RIN, HARUKA]
To the future!

442
00:22:40,558 --> 00:22:42,060
[CROWD]
Go!

443
00:23:43,997 --> 00:23:46,541
[TV ANNOUNCER 12A] Nanase's
still leading at the turn!

444
00:23:46,624 --> 00:23:49,419
[TV ANNOUNCER 12B] Looks like
he's setting an excellent pace!

445
00:23:49,502 --> 00:23:50,837
[TV ANNOUNCER 12A]
If this keeps up, we'll have

446
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,505
a new tournament record.
