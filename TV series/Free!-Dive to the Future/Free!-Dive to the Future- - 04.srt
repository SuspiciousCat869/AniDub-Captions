1
00:00:10,666 --> 00:00:13,708
[IKUYA] Once upon a time,
nestled far, far below

2
00:00:13,791 --> 00:00:16,208
the land where
human beings lived...

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,583
[IKUYA]
At the bottom of the ocean,

4
00:00:18,666 --> 00:00:21,875
which flowed so clear,
like purest glass--

5
00:00:21,958 --> 00:00:25,458
there was the mermaid's kingdom.

6
00:02:18,916 --> 00:02:20,291
[ASAHI]
See?

7
00:02:20,375 --> 00:02:22,791
Kisumi told us Shimogami
doesn't have practice today.

8
00:02:22,875 --> 00:02:24,666
[HARUKA]
Wow, he was actually right.

9
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:26,708
Jeez, have a little
faith in your friend!

10
00:02:26,791 --> 00:02:30,458
[laughs] It's early in the day,
so he might still be in class.

11
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,833
Do you know what
department he's in?

12
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,333
[ASAHI]
Agh, dammit. I forgot to ask!

13
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:38,083
Asahi.

14
00:02:38,166 --> 00:02:40,166
What's up? Did you see Ikuya?

15
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:41,208
Not yet.

16
00:02:41,291 --> 00:02:42,250
We need to find out
what department

17
00:02:42,333 --> 00:02:44,041
his classes are in first.

18
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:46,166
[KISUMI]
Sorry, I don't have that info.

19
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:47,333
Ugh. Are you kidding?

20
00:02:47,416 --> 00:02:48,791
I thought you said
you made friends

21
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,458
with an upperclassman who's
dating one of their guys!

22
00:02:50,541 --> 00:02:51,666
Just ask her!

23
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,750
I would, but I don't
think I can reach her.

24
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:55,750
I'm pretty sure she had made
plans to go to a movie

25
00:02:55,833 --> 00:02:57,875
with her boyfriend today. Sorry!

26
00:02:57,958 --> 00:03:00,625
They're going to see
<i>A Rat's Life 2</i> , actually.

27
00:03:00,708 --> 00:03:02,625
That sounds terrible.

28
00:03:02,708 --> 00:03:04,666
[MAKOTO] I guess we'll just have
to check all the departments

29
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:06,375
and hope we get lucky.

30
00:03:06,458 --> 00:03:08,708
We won't find him by
wandering around.

31
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,916
Uh--

32
00:03:13,083 --> 00:03:14,625
What the...? You again?!

33
00:03:14,708 --> 00:03:15,916
[ASAHI]
Hello, Archerfish!

34
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,750
I told you not to call me that!

35
00:03:17,833 --> 00:03:20,625
Hey, quiet down.
Listen, Archerfish.

36
00:03:20,708 --> 00:03:21,708
[growls]

37
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,041
Ikuya Kirishima.
We're here to see him.

38
00:03:23,125 --> 00:03:25,833
[TERASHIMA] Ha! Sorry,
there's no practice today.

39
00:03:25,916 --> 00:03:27,916
In fact, I was just
on my way to the movies

40
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,291
with my girlfriend.

41
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:31,625
We scored some tickets
to <i>A Rat's Life 2</i> !

42
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:32,625
Wait a minute.

43
00:03:32,708 --> 00:03:34,250
Uh-- Oh, come on.

44
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:36,000
There is no way Kisumi's
friend's boyfriend

45
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:38,000
and this jerk are
the same person.

46
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:39,166
What's the matter?

47
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:42,000
Do you guys know Misae,
too, or something?

48
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:43,875
Hang on, let me make sure.

49
00:03:46,583 --> 00:03:48,500
[ASAHI]
Mm. It's a match.

50
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,333
I can't believe my own
girlfriend calls me Archerfish!

51
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:53,500
There's no justice
in this world!

52
00:03:53,583 --> 00:03:54,125
Anyway.

53
00:03:54,208 --> 00:03:55,500
Am I boring you?

54
00:03:55,583 --> 00:03:58,416
Do you know where we
can find Ikuya right now?

55
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,291
Gimme one good reason
why I should help you guys.

56
00:04:01,375 --> 00:04:03,041
I'd play nice if I were you.

57
00:04:03,125 --> 00:04:05,083
We can tell our friend to
talk to your girl and say.

58
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,291
"Terashima's so awesome!"

59
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,958
If you give us some
intel on Ikuya.

60
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,416
Hey, you okay?

61
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,625
[HIYORI] Yeah, just remembered
I need to do something.

62
00:04:18,708 --> 00:04:20,875
Why don't you go on to
the pool without me, 'kay?

63
00:04:20,958 --> 00:04:22,083
[IKUYA]
'Kay.

64
00:04:22,166 --> 00:04:23,375
Well, good luck with
whatever you're doin'.

65
00:04:23,458 --> 00:04:25,958
Thanks. I won't be too long.

66
00:04:28,958 --> 00:04:29,875
Empty.

67
00:04:29,958 --> 00:04:32,625
Maybe they left for the day.

68
00:04:32,708 --> 00:04:35,875
[HIYORI]
What are you three doin' here?

69
00:04:35,958 --> 00:04:37,375
We came here to
visit our friend.

70
00:04:37,458 --> 00:04:39,541
You got some kinda
problem with that?

71
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:40,916
Oh, this again?

72
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,750
Ikuya's too busy
to waste his time

73
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:45,041
reminiscing on childish things.

74
00:04:45,125 --> 00:04:47,791
--Screw you!
--[HARUKA] Calm down.

75
00:04:47,875 --> 00:04:49,958
Nanase, wasn't it?

76
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,875
I thought I was clear
when we talked before.

77
00:04:51,958 --> 00:04:54,041
Ikuya has a very full schedule.

78
00:04:54,125 --> 00:04:56,250
But there's no practice today.

79
00:04:56,333 --> 00:04:58,958
[HIYORI] No, that's why he's
practicing solo instead.

80
00:04:59,041 --> 00:05:00,791
I'd rather you not disturb him.

81
00:05:00,875 --> 00:05:03,458
We won't interrupt
his training, okay?

82
00:05:03,541 --> 00:05:06,416
We only wanna talk to him
for a few minutes.

83
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:08,708
[sighs]

84
00:05:08,791 --> 00:05:10,500
Well, I can see you're
not backing down,

85
00:05:10,583 --> 00:05:12,666
but at least wait
until he's finished?

86
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:15,333
He should be done in
about two hours or so.

87
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:20,291
[ASAHI] Ugh! I get a bad
feeling from that guy.

88
00:05:20,375 --> 00:05:21,666
It's no big deal.

89
00:05:21,750 --> 00:05:24,166
The important thing is that
we get to visit Ikuya.

90
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:26,208
So, what do you think
we should say to him?

91
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:29,083
[MAKOTO] Hm. Well, first,
we'd better apologize.

92
00:05:29,166 --> 00:05:30,875
And then, uh...

93
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,208
[ASAHI]
Go on.

94
00:05:32,291 --> 00:05:34,250
I wanna talk to him about
the summer training camp

95
00:05:34,333 --> 00:05:36,291
we all did in middle school.

96
00:05:36,375 --> 00:05:38,291
Oh, yeah, I forgot
all about that!

97
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:41,291
But you were the one
who suggested it.

98
00:05:41,375 --> 00:05:43,000
That night while you
guys were asleep,

99
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,916
Ikuya and I had a talk.

100
00:05:46,083 --> 00:05:47,875
[HARUKA] He asked if I'd
race him in freestyle

101
00:05:47,958 --> 00:05:50,000
the next summer.

102
00:05:50,083 --> 00:05:53,208
And then, he made a wish
on a shooting star.

103
00:05:54,916 --> 00:05:57,166
You never told us about that.

104
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,250
Yeah, I wonder what
Ikuya was wishing for.

105
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:00,625
[HIGASHI]
A pork cutlet bowl.

106
00:06:00,708 --> 00:06:01,583
Say wha...?

107
00:06:01,666 --> 00:06:02,916
That's what I wish I had,

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,625
but the ones at this
place are no good.

109
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,375
They have good mackerel.

110
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:12,166
There's no such thing
as good mackerel.

111
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:14,500
So, we meet again, fellas.

112
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,666
[MAKOTO]
It's that guy.

113
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:17,583
Yeah, what a coincidence.

114
00:06:17,666 --> 00:06:20,416
Word to the wise, boys.

115
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:22,958
Always order the
<i>kitsune</i> udon here.

116
00:06:23,041 --> 00:06:24,583
It's the best.

117
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,291
Okay...?

118
00:06:28,458 --> 00:06:30,541
Enjoy your day.

119
00:06:30,625 --> 00:06:31,750
Who is that?

120
00:06:31,833 --> 00:06:34,541
Something tells me he's
not a student here.

121
00:06:54,458 --> 00:06:58,291
[IKUYA] Damn it!
I thought I got over this!

122
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,666
[IKUYA gasps]

123
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,625
[IKUYA]
Not again.

124
00:07:03,708 --> 00:07:07,500
I guess... I'm just...

125
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:08,875
[SHIMOGAMI SWIMMER 4A]
Hey, Kirishima!

126
00:07:08,958 --> 00:07:09,916
[SHIMOGAMI SWIMMER 4B]
He sank!

127
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,083
Ikuya!

128
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:16,375
[panting]

129
00:07:18,458 --> 00:07:20,833
[HIYORI]
Hey! You all right?

130
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:25,000
Yeah, I'm fine.
Leave me alone, okay?

131
00:07:25,083 --> 00:07:27,375
[gasps]

132
00:07:27,458 --> 00:07:29,583
[MAKOTO] We're kinda early,
don't you think?

133
00:07:29,666 --> 00:07:31,375
[ASAHI]
Beats being too late.

134
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:34,541
Maybe this way we can
avoid Ikuya's bodyguard.

135
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:37,416
Not here.

136
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,875
Come on! He lied
to us, didn't he?

137
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:44,541
[HIYORI] Now that's rude.
Of course I wasn't lying to you.

138
00:07:46,333 --> 00:07:48,958
[HARUKA]
We waited, just like you said.

139
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,750
Now let us see him.

140
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,666
[HIYORI]
He already left.

141
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,916
He wasn't feeling very well,
so he decided to finish

142
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,500
practicing early and
turn in for the evening.

143
00:07:57,583 --> 00:07:59,250
Did he now?

144
00:07:59,333 --> 00:08:01,750
Why would I lie about
something like that?

145
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:02,750
If that's the case,

146
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,333
then we'll just go
check in on him.

147
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,916
You don't mind putting us
in touch with him, do you?

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,708
Maybe you should
forget about Ikuya

149
00:08:08,791 --> 00:08:10,208
and mind your own business.

150
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:12,208
Sorry, but if something's
going on with our friend,

151
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:14,875
that is our business!

152
00:08:14,958 --> 00:08:16,666
[HIYORI] Like I said,
this is an especially

153
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:18,625
crucial time for him.

154
00:08:18,708 --> 00:08:20,958
You're athletes, too.
You should understand.

155
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:23,833
We do understand, but you
better cut the attitude!

156
00:08:23,916 --> 00:08:25,708
Let it go, Asahi.

157
00:08:25,791 --> 00:08:28,458
Sorry. I didn't
mean it that way.

158
00:08:28,541 --> 00:08:31,291
So, you guys friends, or what?

159
00:08:33,125 --> 00:08:35,208
I'm his best friend.

160
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,875
I guess I haven't
introduced myself, have I?

161
00:08:40,458 --> 00:08:43,041
My name's Hiyori Toono.

162
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,750
Ikuya and I got
to know each other

163
00:08:44,833 --> 00:08:47,041
while we were studying
abroad in America.

164
00:08:47,125 --> 00:08:49,541
When we came back to Japan,
his older brother,

165
00:08:49,625 --> 00:08:52,541
Natsuya, asked me
to look after him.

166
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,250
Then that means you
know about us already.

167
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:58,416
[HIYORI] Oh, he might have
mentioned you once or twice.

168
00:08:58,500 --> 00:08:59,833
If I remember correctly,

169
00:08:59,916 --> 00:09:02,291
you were his teammates,
but you broke up the Swim Club

170
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:04,916
before your second
year of middle school.

171
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,041
That's why we're here.

172
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,291
We've been trying
to apologize to him.

173
00:09:09,375 --> 00:09:11,666
[HIYORI] What good do you
think that'll do now?

174
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:13,583
During our first summer
break in middle school,

175
00:09:13,666 --> 00:09:15,375
I made him a promise.

176
00:09:15,458 --> 00:09:18,791
I told him I'd race him in
freestyle the summer after.

177
00:09:18,875 --> 00:09:21,083
I just wanna make sure
he knows how sorry I am

178
00:09:21,166 --> 00:09:23,291
that I didn't make
good on my word.

179
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,875
How noble, but that
was so long ago.

180
00:09:26,958 --> 00:09:30,208
He probably doesn't
even remember it now.

181
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:32,500
You're just being a nuisance.

182
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:33,541
Oh, and by the way, guys,

183
00:09:33,625 --> 00:09:36,083
Ikuya doesn't swim
relays anymore.

184
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:38,958
He decided to switch his
focus to the IM a while back.

185
00:09:39,041 --> 00:09:40,291
You know somethin'?

186
00:09:40,375 --> 00:09:41,791
I'm gettin' sick of hearin'
you speak for Ikuya

187
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,791
like you're his damn boss.

188
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:46,083
[HIYORI] His brother
asked me to protect him.

189
00:09:46,166 --> 00:09:48,583
We've known Natsuya
even longer than you have!

190
00:09:48,666 --> 00:09:51,541
We've been friends with Ikuya
since middle school, remember?

191
00:09:51,625 --> 00:09:53,916
But I'm his best friend.

192
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,875
Middle school is one thing,

193
00:09:55,958 --> 00:09:58,791
but if we're talking about
being friends with Ikuya now,

194
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,458
you three don't have the right.

195
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:03,583
"The right"? The hell we don't!

196
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,291
[HIYORI] He's well on his
way to the global stage.

197
00:10:06,375 --> 00:10:08,708
Weaklings like you
would drag him down.

198
00:10:08,791 --> 00:10:09,875
If you're not strong,

199
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,291
you simply don't deserve
to be around him.

200
00:10:12,375 --> 00:10:13,666
That's what I think.

201
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:15,791
--[ASAHI] Oh, yeah?
--Let's settle this with a race.

202
00:10:15,875 --> 00:10:16,500
Haru!

203
00:10:16,583 --> 00:10:19,000
Hah! Race? Great idea.

204
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:21,000
We'll compete with the
right to be friends

205
00:10:21,083 --> 00:10:22,666
with Ikuya on the line.

206
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,166
Oh, but wait,
my specialty's backstroke.

207
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:27,000
And you only swim free.

208
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,833
If I know one thing
about you, it's that.

209
00:10:29,916 --> 00:10:30,916
That's fine, though.

210
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,250
I'm happy to swim
freestyle instead.

211
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,625
So then. Shall we race?

212
00:10:36,583 --> 00:10:39,500
[MAKOTO] I'll race you.
Let's do backstroke.

213
00:10:39,583 --> 00:10:40,583
Makoto.

214
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:43,416
It's gonna be okay, Haru.

215
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,041
Trust me.

216
00:10:45,125 --> 00:10:45,958
[gasps]

217
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:48,166
Tachibana. That right?

218
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:50,958
Ah, so you're going to
step up and race me instead?

219
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:52,791
That sounds like a plan.

220
00:10:52,875 --> 00:10:54,166
This ought to be interesting.

221
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:56,958
We'll see just how
serious you are.

222
00:10:58,125 --> 00:11:00,666
[ASAHI] Are you sure you're
okay with doing this, Makoto?

223
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:02,625
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm. It kinda gave me the urge

224
00:11:02,708 --> 00:11:04,500
to swim for real again.

225
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:07,541
Besides, our friendship with
Ikuya's worth fighting for.

226
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:08,916
[AKANE]
What's all this?

227
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,500
You're having a race against
one of Ikuya's friends?

228
00:11:11,583 --> 00:11:13,750
Do you mind if I come
to cheer you guys on?

229
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,958
This isn't exactly
a happy occasion, sis.

230
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,875
It'd be really weird
to have an audience.

231
00:11:17,958 --> 00:11:19,125
Okay, then.

232
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,291
[KISUMI] Makoto! I just
heard about your race!

233
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,625
Can I come?

234
00:11:23,708 --> 00:11:25,583
No! Like I just said,
it's not that kinda race!

235
00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:28,541
Come on, Asahi, I'm a part
of this, too, you know.

236
00:11:28,625 --> 00:11:30,625
You probably have
a club that day.

237
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:32,333
I can skip it just this once!

238
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:33,375
[laughs]

239
00:11:33,458 --> 00:11:34,833
[ASAHI]
Oh, now you can play hooky?

240
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:37,000
You've got way too much
on your plate, you know that?

241
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,125
[KISUMI]
No fair!

242
00:11:39,083 --> 00:11:40,833
[NAGISA]
Wow, check it out!

243
00:11:40,916 --> 00:11:43,500
That's from our deserted
island camp two years ago!

244
00:11:43,583 --> 00:11:44,958
Sure takes me back!

245
00:11:45,041 --> 00:11:46,208
Sounds like fun.

246
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,458
You wanna go to a
deserted island, too?

247
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:51,208
Let's do a training camp
in another country!

248
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:53,666
[NAGISA]
Ooh! Now there's an idea!

249
00:11:53,750 --> 00:11:55,375
Not so fast, Nagisa.

250
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,416
Training camps are
serious business.

251
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,708
We need to take
a practical approach

252
00:11:58,791 --> 00:12:00,666
and make it as
effective as we can.

253
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:03,250
We just heard back
from Samezuka Academy!

254
00:12:03,333 --> 00:12:04,250
[REI]
Gou!

255
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:05,583
What did they say?

256
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:09,041
[GOU laughs] We did it,
they're totally on board!

257
00:12:09,125 --> 00:12:12,583
Yahoo! I'm going to
camp with Gou!

258
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:13,958
It's not just her.

259
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:17,000
We'll be training with
the whole Iwatobi Swim Club.

260
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:18,291
And Soufuukan, too,

261
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:20,750
so there'll be three
teams in total.

262
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,833
That's right!

263
00:12:21,916 --> 00:12:23,708
I gotta give her
some stag beetle sap.

264
00:12:23,791 --> 00:12:24,708
She's gonna love it!

265
00:12:24,791 --> 00:12:27,416
Hey! Are you listening, Momo?

266
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,583
[MOMOTARO]
Sure!

267
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:31,250
Soufuukan is where
that Capybara guy goes!

268
00:12:31,333 --> 00:12:34,000
This'll be my chance to
beat him in swimming, too!

269
00:12:34,083 --> 00:12:36,041
Just do me a favor
and don't get into a fight

270
00:12:36,125 --> 00:12:38,833
like you did at that
resort over spring break.

271
00:12:38,916 --> 00:12:40,250
Oh, I forgot!

272
00:12:40,333 --> 00:12:42,958
I should probably tell Sosuke
about the training camp.

273
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,458
[DOCTOR 1A]
The way you've been improving,

274
00:12:45,541 --> 00:12:47,500
you're definitely
ready to swim again.

275
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:49,000
[SOSUKE]
Really?

276
00:12:49,083 --> 00:12:51,958
[DOCTOR 1A] Yes. Be careful
not to overwork it, though.

277
00:12:52,041 --> 00:12:55,083
There is a very real risk
of damaging the area again.

278
00:12:55,166 --> 00:12:57,333
And, what happens then?

279
00:12:57,416 --> 00:12:59,458
You'd go back to
rehab, that's all.

280
00:12:59,541 --> 00:13:01,041
Even reinjuring it
wouldn't put you

281
00:13:01,125 --> 00:13:02,875
out of commission permanently.

282
00:13:02,958 --> 00:13:04,833
I guess it's kinda like
I'm carrying a bomb

283
00:13:04,916 --> 00:13:06,333
on my shoulder, huh?

284
00:13:06,416 --> 00:13:08,791
I wouldn't say
it's that serious.

285
00:13:08,875 --> 00:13:10,708
However, if you do want
to return to swimming

286
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,083
at your full capacity,

287
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:15,083
it's possible you'll be
forced to make a decision.

288
00:13:15,166 --> 00:13:16,666
Decision?

289
00:13:21,041 --> 00:13:22,708
[GOU]
Hey, Sosuke!

290
00:13:24,541 --> 00:13:28,000
[SOSUKE]
Gou. You headin' home?

291
00:13:28,083 --> 00:13:30,041
[GOU] Mm-hm! Just got
done with club stuff.

292
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,375
You on your way home, too?

293
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:32,916
Yeah, it's late.

294
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,916
Oh, by the way, I got a text
message from Ai earlier.

295
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,500
About a little training camp.

296
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:39,791
Sounds like both of our
schools are gonna be there.

297
00:13:39,875 --> 00:13:41,083
Yeah, that's right!

298
00:13:41,166 --> 00:13:43,166
Are we gonna see you
there, too, maybe?

299
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,750
Yep. I'll come along as an alum.

300
00:13:45,833 --> 00:13:47,250
The doctor even
said that it's okay

301
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,041
for me to start swimming again.

302
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:50,416
That's wonderful!

303
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:54,041
I know! But don't mention
it to Rin yet, okay?

304
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:55,041
Huh?

305
00:13:55,125 --> 00:13:57,875
It's just, I wanna
tell him myself.

306
00:14:05,291 --> 00:14:07,375
[HIYORI]
Hey, I brought you some snacks.

307
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:09,958
[IKUYA]
That much?

308
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,375
I figured, if you
haven't eaten yet,

309
00:14:11,458 --> 00:14:13,666
I might as well
make you dinner, too.

310
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,041
[IKUYA]
I ate already.

311
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:16,833
You don't have
to do all this stuff.

312
00:14:16,916 --> 00:14:19,333
Oh, come on, at least
have some ice cream!

313
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:20,958
Want me to make some coffee?

314
00:14:21,041 --> 00:14:22,791
It's okay, I can make it.

315
00:14:22,875 --> 00:14:24,750
Just have a seat.

316
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:29,500
Oh, this old thing?
You held onto it, huh?

317
00:14:29,583 --> 00:14:32,333
You really like this story.

318
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:35,500
You do know that everybody's
been worried about you, right?

319
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,041
I mean, it's pretty obvious

320
00:14:37,125 --> 00:14:40,000
that you haven't been running
at your full power recently.

321
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:42,958
Like, no matter how many times
I tell everyone you're okay,

322
00:14:43,041 --> 00:14:45,291
they're not buyin' it.

323
00:14:45,375 --> 00:14:47,000
Captain Hoshikawa's
had his eye on you

324
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:49,375
for a while, too.

325
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:52,250
He really wants you
in that freestyle relay.

326
00:14:52,333 --> 00:14:54,625
Except I don't do
relays anymore.

327
00:14:54,708 --> 00:14:56,125
I know, I know.

328
00:14:56,208 --> 00:14:58,583
You're at your strongest now
that you've devoted yourself

329
00:14:58,666 --> 00:15:00,583
to the individual medley.

330
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,083
I get it.

331
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:05,333
Hiyori. You ran into my old
teammates today, didn't you?

332
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,625
How'd you know?

333
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:12,125
[IKUYA] I saw them nearby,
right as I was heading out.

334
00:15:12,208 --> 00:15:15,083
[HIYORI] Look, I just told them
the same thing as before.

335
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:17,541
That this is a critical
time in your life,

336
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:21,041
and I don't want them
around to distract you.

337
00:15:21,125 --> 00:15:23,083
That's okay, right?

338
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:26,916
[IKUYA]
I guess.

339
00:15:43,291 --> 00:15:45,041
[ISANA]
That's not a great start.

340
00:15:45,125 --> 00:15:46,750
[SUZUKI]
But look at that nice form!

341
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:47,875
[HIKARU]
Yeah, but what good is form

342
00:15:47,958 --> 00:15:49,875
if there's no speed behind it?

343
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:52,541
What's up, Nanase?

344
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:55,916
Next to Suzuki. It's Ikuya!

345
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,916
Yeah, it's Ikuya Kirishima.

346
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,416
We're looking at me!

347
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,166
Sorry, but there's
just no comparison

348
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:02,625
between you and him.

349
00:16:04,083 --> 00:16:05,791
[INADA] He didn't swim
in a high school tournament

350
00:16:05,875 --> 00:16:09,041
over here until he came back
from the US as a third-year,

351
00:16:09,125 --> 00:16:11,166
but he set a tournament record.

352
00:16:11,250 --> 00:16:13,291
He only competed in the IM.

353
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:15,416
You know a lot
about him, Inada.

354
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:17,666
Well, collecting
data's my hobby!

355
00:16:17,750 --> 00:16:19,791
It's kind of unusual for
someone to only swim

356
00:16:19,875 --> 00:16:21,541
in the IM, though.

357
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:25,291
Actually, Ikuya was our
teammate back in middle school.

358
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,458
[HIKARU]
Really?

359
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:28,291
So you guys were friends?

360
00:16:28,375 --> 00:16:32,000
[ASAHI] Yeah, but not
so much these days.

361
00:16:32,083 --> 00:16:33,166
I feel ya.

362
00:16:33,250 --> 00:16:34,541
When old friends stop
seeing each other,

363
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,000
they drift apart and
their friendship just dies.

364
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,125
I've been down that road before.

365
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:40,625
I dunno about all that.

366
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,208
I mean, I've moved around
a lot since I was a little kid,

367
00:16:43,291 --> 00:16:45,041
and I still keep in touch
with my other friends

368
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,125
from back then.

369
00:16:46,208 --> 00:16:48,458
Then what happened
with Kirishima?

370
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:50,625
Did you guys have a fight?

371
00:16:51,666 --> 00:16:53,541
That happens a lot, too.

372
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:55,333
I wouldn't let it bug ya.

373
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:56,708
We should be putting
practice before

374
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,625
friendship right now, anyway.

375
00:16:58,708 --> 00:17:00,041
Yeah. True.

376
00:17:00,125 --> 00:17:01,916
The most important thing
is to stay focused

377
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,333
on getting stronger.

378
00:17:03,416 --> 00:17:05,583
There's more than one way
to make yourself stronger!

379
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:07,166
[SUZUKI]
Whoa, Mikoshiba!

380
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:08,833
Everything that you
gained from the people

381
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:12,333
in your past makes you a better
version of yourself today.

382
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:14,333
Practicing's important,
but plenty of other

383
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:16,458
things in life
are more important.

384
00:17:16,541 --> 00:17:17,791
All right!

385
00:17:17,875 --> 00:17:19,625
It's almost time for the
general meeting to start!

386
00:17:19,708 --> 00:17:20,958
[GROUP]
Right!

387
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,833
[ASAHI]
Guys, we're here! Sorry.

388
00:17:29,916 --> 00:17:31,750
[KISUMI] Hey, what have
you two been doing?

389
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:34,041
Practice ran kinda
late, that's all.

390
00:17:36,958 --> 00:17:38,000
[HARUKA]
Here.

391
00:17:38,083 --> 00:17:40,000
Oh, thanks a lot, Haru.

392
00:17:41,875 --> 00:17:44,791
[KISUMI] Listen, guys.
Are you sure about this?

393
00:17:44,875 --> 00:17:46,833
It just seems kinda
childish to have a contest

394
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,625
over someone's friendship.

395
00:17:48,708 --> 00:17:50,208
I don't get it.

396
00:17:50,291 --> 00:17:53,541
[laughs] True, but I think
some good might come of it.

397
00:17:53,625 --> 00:17:55,625
If I swim with Toono,

398
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,375
maybe it'll help me
understand him better.

399
00:17:58,458 --> 00:18:00,916
There's something about him
that doesn't seem right.

400
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:03,000
I'm not sure what, though.

401
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,000
Well, I still think
it's pretty lame.

402
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:06,916
[ASAHI] The best way to learn
about someone is to swim

403
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,583
with them, right, Haru?

404
00:18:08,666 --> 00:18:09,750
[HARUKA]
Yeah.

405
00:18:09,833 --> 00:18:12,875
Hey! Not everyone's
a swimmer, you know!

406
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:17,000
[MISAKI]
Um. Don't I know you?

407
00:18:17,083 --> 00:18:18,166
[MAKOTO]
Misaki?

408
00:18:18,250 --> 00:18:19,541
Yeah, hi again!

409
00:18:19,625 --> 00:18:21,458
[MAKOTO]
Hi! Good to see you.

410
00:18:21,541 --> 00:18:23,125
[BOY 4A]
Hurry, Misaki!

411
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,416
'Kay! I'll be right over!

412
00:18:29,833 --> 00:18:30,750
Who's that?

413
00:18:30,833 --> 00:18:32,041
That's Misaki.

414
00:18:32,125 --> 00:18:33,166
I met him during spring break

415
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,125
when I was apartment
hunting with Haru.

416
00:18:36,208 --> 00:18:37,958
He had a rival
he wanted to beat,

417
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,791
so he was doing his best
to improve his swimming.

418
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,791
[MAKOTO] His coach had just
resigned out of the blue.

419
00:18:44,875 --> 00:18:48,583
Since we were there, Haru and I
helped him practice a little.

420
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,041
Judging by the flyer,

421
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,750
they're still
looking for a coach.

422
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,583
[MAKOTO] I hope the next time
he sees that rival of his,

423
00:18:55,666 --> 00:18:58,083
they'll be able to
have some fun together.

424
00:18:58,166 --> 00:18:59,666
Yeah, me, too.

425
00:19:21,625 --> 00:19:23,041
You're early.

426
00:19:23,125 --> 00:19:25,000
Didn't think you'd show up.

427
00:19:25,083 --> 00:19:27,416
[HIYORI] Well, you know,
unlike some people,

428
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:30,041
I honor my word.

429
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:33,041
Are you ready to
get started, Tachibana?

430
00:19:33,125 --> 00:19:34,291
Yeah.

431
00:19:38,875 --> 00:19:39,916
[IKUYA]
"The Little Mermaid."

432
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,875
Take your marks!

433
00:19:43,916 --> 00:19:44,958
[whistle blows]

434
00:19:46,333 --> 00:19:48,583
[IKUYA] "Desperate to walk
upon land, the mermaid

435
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,458
went to the lair of
the wicked sea witch.

436
00:19:51,541 --> 00:19:53,708
In exchange for
her lovely voice,

437
00:19:53,791 --> 00:19:56,208
she was granted human legs.

438
00:19:56,291 --> 00:19:57,958
But when she reached the shore,

439
00:19:58,041 --> 00:20:00,458
each step brought
excruciating pain,

440
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:03,625
as though 1,000 swords
were piercing her."

441
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:05,791
[ASAHI]
It's close!

442
00:20:05,875 --> 00:20:07,875
Look at Makoto!

443
00:20:07,958 --> 00:20:09,000
[panting]

444
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,708
[HIYORI]
Damn!

445
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,291
[IKUYA]
What about me?

446
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,250
What's that mean for me?

447
00:20:18,708 --> 00:20:20,541
[IKUYA]
What did I gain?

448
00:20:20,625 --> 00:20:23,750
And what did I
give up to get it?

449
00:20:27,041 --> 00:20:28,166
[HIYORI]
There!

450
00:20:28,250 --> 00:20:31,083
[BOTH panting]

451
00:20:31,166 --> 00:20:33,166
You're not half bad.

452
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,458
[panting]

453
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,958
[HIYORI]
I'm impressed.

454
00:20:39,041 --> 00:20:40,875
You actually put up a
pretty good fight for someone

455
00:20:40,958 --> 00:20:43,291
who hasn't swum in
a while, Tachibana.

456
00:20:43,375 --> 00:20:44,500
You were great, too!

457
00:20:44,583 --> 00:20:47,125
I had no idea you
would be that fast.

458
00:20:47,208 --> 00:20:49,541
Thanks for racing me.

459
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,625
You don't deserve
to speak to Ikuya,

460
00:20:51,708 --> 00:20:53,291
much less be his friends.

461
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,125
[ASAHI] Are you--
What the hell are you saying?

462
00:20:55,208 --> 00:20:56,458
[KISUMI]
Asahi.

463
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:59,208
But still, you did take
the time to race with me,

464
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:02,708
so let me tell you something
you don't know about him.

465
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,125
It's my gift to you.

466
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:06,041
All right, tell us.

467
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:07,500
[HIYORI] You remember
back in middle school

468
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:10,166
when he ran out of oxygen
and almost drowned?

469
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:14,625
[HIYORI]
Yeah, I figured you would.

470
00:21:14,708 --> 00:21:16,750
Well, he had another
oxygen deprivation

471
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:18,916
incident in the states.

472
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:22,500
[HIYORI]
And this one was very serious.

473
00:21:22,583 --> 00:21:24,583
He was in the
hospital for a while.

474
00:21:26,208 --> 00:21:27,791
[MAKOTO]
Really?

475
00:21:27,875 --> 00:21:29,166
[ASAHI]
No way.

476
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,875
[HIYORI]
Ikuya is quite delicate.

477
00:21:31,958 --> 00:21:34,125
But, he eventually
overcame everything

478
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:36,208
that happened to him,
and now he's an even stronger

479
00:21:36,291 --> 00:21:39,333
swimmer than he ever was before.

480
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,708
It's funny.

481
00:21:40,791 --> 00:21:42,583
I've heard a lot
about you, Nanase,

482
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:44,750
and I've begun to
notice a pattern.

483
00:21:44,833 --> 00:21:47,041
People you swim with
all seem to end up

484
00:21:47,125 --> 00:21:48,708
suffering, don't they?

485
00:21:48,791 --> 00:21:50,125
[HARUKA gasps]

486
00:22:01,541 --> 00:22:02,875
Haru.

487
00:22:07,625 --> 00:22:09,083
[HARUKA]
I...

488
00:22:12,166 --> 00:22:13,708
[REI] Now it's our turn
for some action!

489
00:22:13,791 --> 00:22:16,333
[NAGISA] Our joint training
camp is loaded with people!

490
00:22:16,416 --> 00:22:18,291
[REI]
Next time: "An Ominous Workout!"

491
00:22:18,375 --> 00:22:19,583
[NAGISA]
Let's do this!
