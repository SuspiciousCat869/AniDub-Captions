1
00:00:12,208 --> 00:00:16,041
[IKUYA]
I'm alone again. I have no one.

2
00:00:16,125 --> 00:00:17,875
No one to save me.

3
00:00:19,416 --> 00:00:22,041
[IKUYA]
So, I guess... I...

4
00:00:24,375 --> 00:00:28,958
[IKUYA gasps, pants]

5
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:34,875
[phone vibrates]

6
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,291
Good morning, Ikuya.
You sleeping?

7
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,750
[IKUYA] Not anymore,
thanks to you. What's up?

8
00:00:39,833 --> 00:00:42,666
Not much. Thought I'd
give you a wakeup call.

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:45,333
Wouldn't want you to
be late for practice.

10
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,125
[IKUYA]
I'm not gonna be late.

11
00:00:47,208 --> 00:00:48,958
Good, you'd get in trouble.

12
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,333
You know, I've been
thinking about

13
00:00:50,416 --> 00:00:52,125
what happened yesterday.

14
00:00:52,208 --> 00:00:54,625
Your old teammate
from middle school.

15
00:00:54,708 --> 00:00:56,500
Nanase, wasn't it?

16
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,666
Look, it's not that big a deal.
Just forget about it.

17
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:03,041
I gotta get ready to go,
so, I'll see ya later.

18
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:45,916
[alarm beeping]

19
00:03:03,041 --> 00:03:08,000
[music plays]

20
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:09,833
[DAVID]
G'day, Rin.

21
00:04:09,916 --> 00:04:11,208
Oh, hey, David.

22
00:04:11,291 --> 00:04:13,208
So, how do you like
Mikhail as a coach?

23
00:04:13,291 --> 00:04:15,583
He's great, but...

24
00:04:15,666 --> 00:04:17,416
But what?

25
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,916
Quick question, Rin- <i>kun</i> !

26
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,583
Do you like ramen with barbeque
pork or fish cake in it?

27
00:04:22,666 --> 00:04:25,458
He's... different.

28
00:04:25,541 --> 00:04:28,791
[DAVID] He's known for being
smart, but a bit eccentric.

29
00:04:28,875 --> 00:04:30,166
You're lucky though.

30
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,000
Mikhail's really sought after.

31
00:04:32,083 --> 00:04:33,875
He rarely coaches
people one-on-one.

32
00:04:33,958 --> 00:04:36,041
[RIN]
Yeah. I'm kinda surprised.

33
00:04:37,416 --> 00:04:39,250
[DAVID] Well, he must've
seen something in ya

34
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:40,250
that he likes.

35
00:04:40,333 --> 00:04:43,041
[RIN]
I'm not sure what though.

36
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,625
But regardless, I'm grateful.

37
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:47,916
Yeah.

38
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,541
Hey, Chris. What's wrong?

39
00:04:49,625 --> 00:04:52,000
Oi! Rin! Guess what?

40
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,708
This random Japanese guy,
just showed up outta nowhere

41
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,041
and asked Mikhail to
coach him! Isn't that crazy?

42
00:04:57,125 --> 00:04:58,291
Huh?

43
00:04:58,375 --> 00:05:00,416
[CHRIS] Mikhail said no,
but then the guy said,

44
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,541
"If I beat everyone here,
then you have to be my coach!"

45
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,416
[DAVID] Japanese guy...
Friend of yours, maybe?

46
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,416
No. Doesn't sound
like anyone I know.

47
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:12,125
[JOHANN]
He's fast!

48
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,458
[DAVID]
Huh?

49
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,958
[NATSUYA] I'm not that fast--
maybe all of you guys

50
00:05:18,041 --> 00:05:19,666
are just too slow.

51
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:23,375
Huh?

52
00:05:27,458 --> 00:05:29,791
Well, well, well! Wanna go next?

53
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:36,875
[RIN]
Sounds fun.

54
00:05:39,458 --> 00:05:41,333
Just try and keep up.

55
00:05:41,416 --> 00:05:43,708
Oh. Somebody's confident!

56
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:46,666
It isn't worth your time.

57
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:48,666
[RIN]
But, Coach.

58
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,791
No matter how many
people you can outswim,

59
00:05:50,875 --> 00:05:53,375
I'm still not going
to agree to your deal.

60
00:05:54,541 --> 00:05:56,041
Ugh. Why not?

61
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:58,791
You've already seen how
easily I beat these guys.

62
00:05:58,875 --> 00:06:01,750
[MIKHAIL] Pure speed is not
the only thing I care about.

63
00:06:01,833 --> 00:06:03,416
[NATSUYA]
So what more do you want?

64
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:06,833
[MIKHAIL]
If you must know, it's...

65
00:06:06,916 --> 00:06:09,500
[NATSUYA]
Ah-- Uh...

66
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,375
[MIKHAIL]
Muscles.

67
00:06:11,458 --> 00:06:12,625
Huh?

68
00:06:12,708 --> 00:06:14,500
You've got them, but not
really the kind I like.

69
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:15,708
[NATSUYA]
What does that mean?

70
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,458
He kinda reminds me
of my sister.

71
00:06:17,541 --> 00:06:20,083
You see, Rin- <i>kun</i> 's muscles
are cho-very-good.

72
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,458
Cho-very-what-now?

73
00:06:21,541 --> 00:06:23,708
It's Japanese slang,
it means "amazing."

74
00:06:23,791 --> 00:06:25,541
I figured you would
understand that.

75
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:27,125
It's not that I
don't understand,

76
00:06:27,208 --> 00:06:28,666
it's that nobody
says that anymore.

77
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,916
Really? Is that true?

78
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,791
Yeah.

79
00:06:32,875 --> 00:06:34,791
Oh, no! I'm uncool!

80
00:06:34,875 --> 00:06:38,041
I'd say I'm MK5, but I
bet that's out, too!

81
00:06:45,666 --> 00:06:48,041
[RIN]
He really is skilled as a coach.

82
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,708
[TSUKAMOTO] Inada got sixth in
the 100-meter breaststroke.

83
00:06:57,791 --> 00:07:00,583
Kiryuu placed third
in 200-meter free.

84
00:07:00,666 --> 00:07:03,583
And Nanase got second
in 100-meter free.

85
00:07:10,333 --> 00:07:12,083
[MIKOSHIBA]
Hey, Nanase.

86
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,708
You okay? You're spacing out.

87
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:17,958
No, I'm all right.
I'm just thinking.

88
00:07:18,041 --> 00:07:20,083
[TSUKAMOTO] ...focus on those
events during practice.

89
00:07:35,916 --> 00:07:37,000
[IKUYA gasps]

90
00:07:42,916 --> 00:07:44,041
[HOSHIKAWA]
Kirishima.

91
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:47,208
So, I guess the
tournament went well.

92
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:48,291
[IKUYA]
Yeah.

93
00:07:48,375 --> 00:07:50,166
You know, your IM
is really amazing.

94
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:51,875
It's a shame that's your
only event though--

95
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:53,500
you're such a great swimmer.

96
00:07:53,583 --> 00:07:55,500
Why don't you do
freestyle relay?

97
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:58,166
Well, that isn't
really my thing.

98
00:07:58,250 --> 00:08:01,250
[HIYORI] Sorry, captain, but
Ikuya doesn't swim in relays.

99
00:08:01,333 --> 00:08:02,708
Why not?

100
00:08:02,791 --> 00:08:05,000
Because he prefers to focus
on the individual events.

101
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:06,416
Right? Tell him.

102
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,541
Yeah.

103
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,583
I can perform better
if I'm by myself.

104
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,083
[HOSHIKAWA]
What kinda reason is that?

105
00:08:11,166 --> 00:08:13,208
I gotta go. Sorry.

106
00:08:17,833 --> 00:08:20,083
[HOSHIKAWA]
Wasted potential.

107
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:21,666
[SAOTOME] Hey, do you
wanna go to that meetup

108
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,958
with Oudoukan University later?

109
00:08:24,041 --> 00:08:26,750
Thanks, I would, but I already
have plans for today, so...

110
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,583
[SAOTOME] What, again?
You're no fun, Tachibana.

111
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,000
Sorry, next time.

112
00:08:32,083 --> 00:08:34,083
[SOSUKE]
Kirishima?

113
00:08:34,166 --> 00:08:36,666
Oh. You've been
talking to Nagisa.

114
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:37,791
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm.

115
00:08:37,875 --> 00:08:39,125
[SOSUKE]
I think I saw him compete

116
00:08:39,208 --> 00:08:40,250
in the individual medley,

117
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:43,916
but that's about
all the info I have.

118
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,750
Is there some kind of problem?

119
00:08:45,833 --> 00:08:49,375
[MAKOTO] No. I mean,
Haru talked to him a little.

120
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:50,708
And from the sound of it...

121
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:55,416
Well, I dunno, it seems
like he's changed a lot.

122
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:56,833
[SOSUKE sighs]

123
00:08:56,916 --> 00:08:59,000
[MAKOTO] You know, since Haru
and I both quit swimming

124
00:08:59,083 --> 00:09:01,833
for a while back in middle
school and everything.

125
00:09:03,458 --> 00:09:06,166
Old teammates are tough. Yeah.

126
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:13,708
Yo.

127
00:09:13,791 --> 00:09:16,416
I guess I haven't introduced
myself to you, have I?

128
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,625
My name's Natsuya Kirishima.

129
00:09:18,708 --> 00:09:20,375
I'm Rin Matsuoka.

130
00:09:20,458 --> 00:09:23,083
[NATSUYA] Really? Thought
Rin was a girl's name.

131
00:09:25,375 --> 00:09:25,833
[NATSUYA sighs]

132
00:09:25,916 --> 00:09:27,125
Uh--

133
00:09:27,208 --> 00:09:29,833
Look, no reason you
gotta be so uptight.

134
00:09:29,916 --> 00:09:32,041
How 'bout we get
somethin' to eat?

135
00:09:32,125 --> 00:09:34,208
This is my first time
here in Sydney.

136
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,875
Come show me around!

137
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,333
Ah!

138
00:09:46,416 --> 00:09:47,916
[RIN]
You like your beer, huh?

139
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,125
[NATSUYA]
Yeah, is that a problem?

140
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,916
[RIN]
Just not sure it's a good idea

141
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,166
for a competitive swimmer.

142
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,750
[NATSUYA]
Well, I don't have a team.

143
00:09:54,833 --> 00:09:57,416
So only person I have
to answer to is me.

144
00:09:57,500 --> 00:10:00,333
Ah. Then what do you...

145
00:10:00,416 --> 00:10:01,791
[NATSUYA]
Collect prize money.

146
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,333
I don't follow.

147
00:10:03,416 --> 00:10:05,791
[NATSUYA] Okay, I spend
my days travelling all over

148
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,541
the world entering races
that offer cash prizes.

149
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:10,666
Naturally. I win.

150
00:10:10,750 --> 00:10:12,208
And then...

151
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:14,916
I use the prize money I get
to set off for a new place.

152
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:19,708
See, there's more than one kind
of lifestyle for swimmers.

153
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:22,333
A lot of people go this route.

154
00:10:22,416 --> 00:10:23,333
What's wrong?

155
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,916
Uh, nothing.

156
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,333
It does seem like a waste
of your talent, though.

157
00:10:27,416 --> 00:10:28,625
Well, enough about me.

158
00:10:28,708 --> 00:10:30,708
Somebody told me
that you went to Sano.

159
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:31,625
Uh?

160
00:10:31,708 --> 00:10:33,208
Iwatobi kid here.

161
00:10:33,291 --> 00:10:34,583
Wait, are you kidding?

162
00:10:34,666 --> 00:10:38,458
Then do you know Haru?
Sorry, I mean Haruka Nanase.

163
00:10:38,541 --> 00:10:41,250
Haruka Nanase? Yeah, I know him.

164
00:10:41,333 --> 00:10:43,958
He started going to Iwatobi
when I was in my third year.

165
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:45,333
You mean middle school, right?

166
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,708
Yeah. Weren't you
at Sano Middle?

167
00:10:47,791 --> 00:10:49,208
Oh, uh, no.

168
00:10:49,291 --> 00:10:51,458
I was here in Australia
as an exchange student

169
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:52,875
training in swimming.

170
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:55,083
Damn, you came here
when you were that young?

171
00:10:55,166 --> 00:10:56,875
You were kinda cocky
then, weren't ya?

172
00:10:56,958 --> 00:11:00,250
You think so?
Yeah, maybe a little.

173
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:02,958
You know, Haruka was
pretty cocky, too.

174
00:11:03,041 --> 00:11:06,583
Always said "I only
swim free." Constantly!

175
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,375
Then again, I heard he
gave up on the sport.

176
00:11:08,458 --> 00:11:10,000
[gasps]

177
00:11:10,083 --> 00:11:11,833
So, what's he been
up to recently?

178
00:11:11,916 --> 00:11:14,375
He's not really done
with swimming, is he?

179
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,291
No. He picked it
back up in high school

180
00:11:16,375 --> 00:11:19,125
and now he's training with
his college team in Japan.

181
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:22,041
He's aiming for the global
stage, the same as I am.

182
00:11:22,125 --> 00:11:24,166
Swimming with him
at the world level...

183
00:11:24,250 --> 00:11:26,000
That's my dream.

184
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,333
Interesting.

185
00:11:27,416 --> 00:11:28,916
If that's how you feel,
then you might end up

186
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,333
being my little brother's rival.

187
00:11:31,416 --> 00:11:34,416
[RIN]
Oh, you have a brother?

188
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,791
Uh, Natsuya?

189
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:39,041
[snoring]

190
00:11:39,125 --> 00:11:40,958
[RIN]
Come on, keep it together here.

191
00:11:41,041 --> 00:11:43,166
[NATSUYA]
Sorry, heh.

192
00:11:43,250 --> 00:11:44,750
This is where I'm staying.

193
00:11:44,833 --> 00:11:46,125
Thanks a lot.

194
00:11:47,208 --> 00:11:48,541
What is it?

195
00:11:48,625 --> 00:11:52,416
Nothin'. I stayed at
this place once, too.

196
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,791
[RIN] Jeez, that guy
is so high-maintenance.

197
00:12:00,875 --> 00:12:02,208
[sighs]

198
00:12:11,583 --> 00:12:14,291
Maybe... I'll tell
him in person.

199
00:12:17,666 --> 00:12:20,583
[MAKOTO] Hey, everybody,
sorry I'm so late.

200
00:12:20,666 --> 00:12:22,083
Wait, where's Kisumi?

201
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,416
He said he had a
meeting with his club.

202
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:27,833
Dang, he's really getting into
this whole college thing, huh?

203
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,083
Yeah, I think it
kinda suits him.

204
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,125
Anyway, do we have a plan
for visiting Ikuya yet?

205
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:36,958
Actually, you know...

206
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:38,916
I'm not sure it's a
good idea for all of us

207
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,541
to barge in on him like that.

208
00:12:40,625 --> 00:12:43,000
Maybe, it'd be better
if Kisumi went there solo

209
00:12:43,083 --> 00:12:44,666
and broke the ice first.

210
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,666
What's up? That doesn't
sound like you.

211
00:12:46,750 --> 00:12:49,541
Sorry. I just don't
know what to say,

212
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:52,166
since I promised him that
I wouldn't move again.

213
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:57,416
It'll be fine. He's
not mad about that.

214
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,166
That's right, you talked to him
about it before, didn't you?

215
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:02,375
[MAKOTO]
Mm-hm.

216
00:13:02,458 --> 00:13:03,833
The two of us had a conversation

217
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:07,125
after you quit the team
and Asahi moved away.

218
00:13:07,208 --> 00:13:08,666
The team broke up, of course,

219
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:11,291
but it seemed like
he was optimistic

220
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,791
about continuing to swim.

221
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:16,583
[ASAHI] Hm. Not long after that,
he went off to America

222
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,041
with Natsuya, didn't he?

223
00:13:18,125 --> 00:13:19,291
[MAKOTO]
Yeah.

224
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:22,250
What was the deal with
that super rude guy

225
00:13:22,333 --> 00:13:23,583
back at the tournament?

226
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:25,125
Are they friends
from high school?

227
00:13:25,208 --> 00:13:26,625
Dunno.

228
00:13:26,708 --> 00:13:29,583
[ASAHI] I don't even know what
high school Ikuya went to,

229
00:13:29,666 --> 00:13:32,125
or how long he's been
back from the states.

230
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,916
It's kinda like...
even though we all

231
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,583
used to be teammates
when we were younger,

232
00:13:39,666 --> 00:13:42,250
we don't really know
anything about him now.

233
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:06,375
Hey, good swimming.

234
00:14:06,458 --> 00:14:07,458
But I noticed your rhythm

235
00:14:07,541 --> 00:14:08,833
was a little bit
different than usual.

236
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:10,166
Is there something on your mind?

237
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,083
[IKUYA]
No, not really.

238
00:14:13,166 --> 00:14:15,291
[HIYORI] You're breathing
kinda heavy, too.

239
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,541
[IKUYA]
You worry too much.

240
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,708
[JOHANN]
He's here again.

241
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,583
That's four days in a row, yeah?

242
00:14:28,666 --> 00:14:30,375
Won't take no for an answer.

243
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:32,250
Look, mate, you
should prob'ly stop

244
00:14:32,333 --> 00:14:34,208
hangin' out with
this guy every night.

245
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,916
It's not a big deal.
He's harmless.

246
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:40,958
[RIN]
Mikhail?

247
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,458
[MIKHAIL]
Natsuya- <i>kun</i> .

248
00:14:46,541 --> 00:14:49,333
Come back all you want,
but I won't change my mind.

249
00:14:49,416 --> 00:14:51,916
Heh. Yeah, that's
what you think.

250
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,583
[MIKHAIL]
You're quite confident.

251
00:14:53,666 --> 00:14:55,458
You said you like muscles.

252
00:14:55,541 --> 00:14:57,041
I've got just the thing.

253
00:14:57,125 --> 00:14:58,041
[MIKHAIL]
Mm.

254
00:14:58,125 --> 00:15:00,916
[NATSUYA]
Heh, heh! How's this?

255
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,875
I already have that.

256
00:15:02,958 --> 00:15:04,541
I should've known.

257
00:15:04,625 --> 00:15:06,375
All right, then, how 'bout this?

258
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:07,833
[gasps]

259
00:15:07,916 --> 00:15:09,250
[NATSUYA]
It's a rare find in Japan,

260
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:11,916
coveted by muscle
maniacs nation-wide!

261
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,666
I'm pretty sure my little
sister has the same one.

262
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,041
[MIKHAIL]
Does she really?

263
00:15:16,125 --> 00:15:18,333
Well then, please, you must
introduce me to her!

264
00:15:18,416 --> 00:15:19,250
[gasps]

265
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,000
Is everything okay?

266
00:15:21,083 --> 00:15:24,250
I just had a really
ominous feeling.

267
00:15:24,333 --> 00:15:25,666
Ayumu!

268
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:27,291
If anything should happen
to me, I need you to swear

269
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,416
that you'll protect
this book with your life!

270
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,458
I can't promise you that.

271
00:15:32,708 --> 00:15:35,000
Hey, guys, I'm here.

272
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:36,583
Look what the cat dragged in.

273
00:15:36,666 --> 00:15:39,083
You could've at least called
and told us you'd be late.

274
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,750
What've you been doing?

275
00:15:40,833 --> 00:15:43,000
Oh, just gathering
some information.

276
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,166
I happened to make friends
with an upperclassman

277
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,916
whose boyfriend is a member
of Shimogami's Swim Club.

278
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,416
For real?

279
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,500
[KISUMI] Mm-hm. And according
to intel collected with my

280
00:15:51,583 --> 00:15:56,125
super detective skills,
the 25th is X Day!

281
00:15:56,208 --> 00:15:57,625
[ASAHI]
X Day?

282
00:15:57,708 --> 00:16:00,125
In other words, it's the one day
they don't have practice.

283
00:16:00,208 --> 00:16:03,000
That's prob'ly the day
you guys should visit Ikuya.

284
00:16:03,083 --> 00:16:04,500
[MAKOTO]
What do you mean "you guys"?

285
00:16:04,583 --> 00:16:05,375
Aren't you going?

286
00:16:05,458 --> 00:16:06,625
[KISUMI]
Me? Sorry, I can't.

287
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:07,958
I have a meeting with
another club that day--

288
00:16:08,041 --> 00:16:09,541
[ASAHI] Damn it, what's
more important to you?

289
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,750
Your friends or
your stupid clubs?

290
00:16:11,833 --> 00:16:14,500
[KISUMI] They're both important,
don't make me choose!

291
00:16:14,583 --> 00:16:16,375
[NATSUYA] Hate to keep
dragging you out so much.

292
00:16:16,458 --> 00:16:18,875
[RIN] If you feel that bad,
I'll let you buy.

293
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:20,125
Sorry, can't.

294
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:22,000
I have a strict policy
against spoiling people.

295
00:16:22,083 --> 00:16:24,791
I guess you're gonna hafta
keep paying for your own food.

296
00:16:24,875 --> 00:16:26,833
[phone vibrates]

297
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:34,541
[RIN]
Is everything okay?

298
00:16:34,625 --> 00:16:37,541
Message from home.
Ikuya's struggling.

299
00:16:37,625 --> 00:16:38,583
Ikuya?

300
00:16:38,666 --> 00:16:40,291
[NATSUYA]
My little brother.

301
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,791
Why's that ring a bell?

302
00:16:42,875 --> 00:16:45,166
It's Ikuya Kirishima.

303
00:16:45,250 --> 00:16:47,041
Kirishima?

304
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,708
So, Ikuya said he's
having a hard time?

305
00:16:50,791 --> 00:16:52,625
[NATSUYA]
No, that was a friend of his.

306
00:16:52,708 --> 00:16:55,500
They met in America while
he was studying abroad.

307
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:59,083
That's cool. Your brother went
overseas for swim training, too.

308
00:17:00,958 --> 00:17:02,041
Did you tell me
that you were friends

309
00:17:02,125 --> 00:17:03,666
with Haruka Nanase?

310
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:04,916
[RIN]
Yeah.

311
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:09,416
In his first year
of middle school,

312
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,875
Ikuya swam the
relay with Haruka.

313
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,500
But Haruka left the
Swimming Club after that.

314
00:17:18,708 --> 00:17:20,750
[NATSUYA] One by one, his
other teammates either quit

315
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:26,541
or moved away, so the team
broke up. Ikuya was all alone.

316
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:27,916
[NATSUYA] That's why,
during his second year,

317
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,291
he came to America,
where I was studying.

318
00:17:31,375 --> 00:17:33,541
I mean, it's not like
I hold it against anybody,

319
00:17:33,625 --> 00:17:35,166
of course.

320
00:17:38,791 --> 00:17:40,000
Once he made it to the states,

321
00:17:40,083 --> 00:17:43,500
he put all of his energy
into practicing with me.

322
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:45,041
But my brother's problem
is that he gets

323
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:48,791
so focused on something, he
loses sight of everything else.

324
00:17:48,875 --> 00:17:50,333
One day, he pushed
himself too hard

325
00:17:50,416 --> 00:17:52,458
and almost drowned in the pool.

326
00:17:53,583 --> 00:17:55,125
[NATSUYA] There was no
serious physical damage,

327
00:17:55,208 --> 00:17:59,708
but the mental shock must've
taken a huge toll on him.

328
00:17:59,791 --> 00:18:02,250
He had to stay in the
hospital for a while.

329
00:18:05,625 --> 00:18:09,333
[NATSUYA] Still, I think that
experience made him stronger.

330
00:18:09,416 --> 00:18:10,583
Not just in breaststroke,

331
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,041
but free, butterfly,

332
00:18:12,125 --> 00:18:14,666
and backstroke, too.
He mastered all of them

333
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:17,875
and completely swore
off doing relays.

334
00:18:17,958 --> 00:18:20,916
He keeps posting better
and better IM times,

335
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,750
but at the pace he's
going, I'm worried

336
00:18:22,833 --> 00:18:25,583
that he might hit a plateau.

337
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,541
I want Ikuya to make it
to the global level.

338
00:18:30,583 --> 00:18:32,208
[RIN]
What about you, though?

339
00:18:32,291 --> 00:18:33,416
Huh?

340
00:18:33,500 --> 00:18:35,541
Don't you wanna get
to that point yourself?

341
00:18:37,083 --> 00:18:39,250
Nah, I don't really need to.

342
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,208
I swim when I want, how I want.

343
00:18:41,291 --> 00:18:43,416
[RIN] Then why did you ask
Mikhail to coach you?

344
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,791
[NATSUYA]
So I can get better, of course.

345
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:49,375
But, it's not because
I care about medals.

346
00:18:49,458 --> 00:18:50,791
[gasps]

347
00:19:01,083 --> 00:19:02,833
Natsuya, are you saying
your dream is to--

348
00:19:02,916 --> 00:19:05,000
Hey. You feel like
havin' a race with me?

349
00:19:05,083 --> 00:19:05,916
Huh?

350
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,041
Two-hundred-meter freestyle!

351
00:19:08,125 --> 00:19:09,291
What, are you chicken?

352
00:19:09,375 --> 00:19:11,708
[RIN] No, you said you
only swim how you want.

353
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,416
[NATSUYA]
Well, this is what I want!

354
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,041
[RIN]
But, there's no money in it.

355
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,875
[NATSUYA]
Then let's just make a bet.

356
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:18,541
Uh. Loser buys dinner.

357
00:19:18,625 --> 00:19:20,666
[RIN]
That's not an equal bet, though.

358
00:19:20,750 --> 00:19:21,833
Not the way you drink.

359
00:19:21,916 --> 00:19:23,875
[NATSUYA]
Okay, how 'bout a new swimsuit?

360
00:19:23,958 --> 00:19:25,916
[RIN]
I don't need one right now.

361
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,458
No dice, huh? Let me see.

362
00:19:28,541 --> 00:19:30,791
[RIN laughs]
You're like Sosuke.

363
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,833
[NATSUYA]
Hm?

364
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,375
Oh, Sosuke was a
good friend of mine

365
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,708
from back home.

366
00:19:34,791 --> 00:19:36,916
He always wanted to make
everything a competition.

367
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,083
But, what? He's not
your friend anymore?

368
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,125
[panting]

369
00:19:40,208 --> 00:19:42,125
[RIN]
He's a rival and a friend.

370
00:19:42,208 --> 00:19:43,625
[NATSUYA]
So he's a swimmer like us, then.

371
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:46,291
[RIN]
Yeah, but he hurt his shoulder.

372
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:48,250
Once it heals,

373
00:19:48,333 --> 00:19:51,166
I swear we're gonna
swim together again!

374
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,500
And Haruka?

375
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:56,458
Wow, that seems to be
a common theme with you.

376
00:19:56,541 --> 00:19:59,041
How many of these
dreams do you have?

377
00:19:59,125 --> 00:20:01,125
[NATSUYA]
Mm! Okay, how 'bout this idea?

378
00:20:01,208 --> 00:20:04,166
If I win, then I get to
crash at your apartment!

379
00:20:04,250 --> 00:20:05,625
I only have the hotel
till next week.

380
00:20:05,708 --> 00:20:07,041
[RIN]
Uh...

381
00:20:07,125 --> 00:20:08,750
[chuckles]

382
00:20:11,416 --> 00:20:16,833
[beeping]

383
00:20:16,916 --> 00:20:20,083
[VOICE 3A]
Take your marks!

384
00:20:20,166 --> 00:20:21,166
[beep]

385
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:30,833
[NATSUYA] Leaning on that
precious leg strength, huh?

386
00:20:30,916 --> 00:20:32,333
Nice try!

387
00:20:40,916 --> 00:20:41,958
[RIN]
He caught up!

388
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:43,875
[NATSUYA]
Now it's about to get fun!

389
00:20:47,916 --> 00:20:50,541
[RIN]
Damn, he's powerful!

390
00:20:50,625 --> 00:20:51,708
Ha!

391
00:20:58,416 --> 00:20:59,750
Aw!

392
00:21:00,833 --> 00:21:02,083
[NATSUYA]
This sucks.

393
00:21:02,166 --> 00:21:05,375
It wasn't supposed
to storm until tomorrow!

394
00:21:05,458 --> 00:21:07,875
Oh, well, guess there's
always next time.

395
00:21:07,958 --> 00:21:10,791
Do you still need
a place to stay, though?

396
00:21:10,875 --> 00:21:12,375
Think I'll go to Japan.

397
00:21:12,458 --> 00:21:13,083
[RIN]
Huh?

398
00:21:13,166 --> 00:21:14,291
Nice meeting you, Rin.

399
00:21:14,375 --> 00:21:16,791
And thanks, by the way.

400
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:18,958
Because of you, I remembered
that I have somebody

401
00:21:19,041 --> 00:21:20,875
I wanna swim with, too.

402
00:21:25,166 --> 00:21:27,291
[MIKHAIL] Well, looks like
he got the message.

403
00:21:27,375 --> 00:21:28,708
Did you really not
wanna work with him

404
00:21:28,791 --> 00:21:30,791
because of his muscles?

405
00:21:30,875 --> 00:21:32,041
[MIKHAIL]
Rin- <i>kun</i> .

406
00:21:32,125 --> 00:21:33,541
There are two types of
muscles in this world.

407
00:21:33,625 --> 00:21:35,416
There's the kind of
muscles that I like

408
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:37,750
and the kind I can do without.

409
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,708
His were the latter.

410
00:21:39,791 --> 00:21:41,125
[RIN]
So you did mean it.

411
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,833
I never say anything
I don't mean.

412
00:21:43,916 --> 00:21:45,166
But still.

413
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:46,500
I don't feel like there
would have been any point

414
00:21:46,583 --> 00:21:48,291
in my coaching that young man.

415
00:21:48,375 --> 00:21:49,791
[RIN]
Huh?

416
00:21:49,875 --> 00:21:51,166
[MIKHAIL] His face told me
that what matters most to him

417
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,416
is not here.

418
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,541
You figured that out
just from his face?

419
00:21:54,625 --> 00:21:55,625
Of course.

420
00:21:55,708 --> 00:21:58,125
I used to know someone
like that, too.

421
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,041
[REI] At last, our friends
are infiltrating Shimo U!

422
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,166
[NAGISA]
Then what happens?

423
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:17,125
[REI] Next time:
"Interference of Loss!"

424
00:22:17,208 --> 00:22:19,541
[NAGISA]
A fireworks display of feelings!
