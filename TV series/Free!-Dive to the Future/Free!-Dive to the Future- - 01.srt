1
00:00:16,041 --> 00:00:19,000
[HARUKA]
Water is alive.

2
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:22,666
I can't imagine how many times
I've had that thought.

3
00:00:24,458 --> 00:00:26,458
[HARUKA]
Water's a living thing.

4
00:00:26,541 --> 00:00:29,500
No matter how much your
body grows and changes,

5
00:00:29,583 --> 00:00:32,708
the water'll always reach
out and embrace you.

6
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:35,708
It's got a mind of its own.

7
00:00:35,791 --> 00:00:37,041
But...

8
00:00:39,625 --> 00:00:42,916
[HARUKA]
How long can that last?

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,083
It's not just about water,

10
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:48,958
there's one other thought
that's always stuck with me.

11
00:00:49,041 --> 00:00:50,416
[gasps]

12
00:00:53,166 --> 00:00:54,958
[HARUKA]
Prodigy at ten.

13
00:00:55,041 --> 00:00:56,666
Genius at 15.

14
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:59,000
At 20, I'll be...

15
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:04,833
[HARUKA]
Makoto.

16
00:01:04,916 --> 00:01:07,333
Hey, Haruka. G'morning!

17
00:01:13,958 --> 00:01:15,041
[MAKOTO]
Whoa!

18
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,666
Aw. Not cool, Haru!

19
00:01:20,750 --> 00:01:22,875
You came here to swim, right?

20
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:25,125
Uh, well, yeah, but...

21
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,833
[MAKOTO chuckles]
I swear. Sometimes it seems like

22
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,541
you can't survive
out of water, Haruka.

23
00:01:41,208 --> 00:01:44,250
[HARUKA]
Don't call me Haruka.

24
00:01:44,333 --> 00:01:46,125
[MAKOTO] In high school,
you always used to talk about

25
00:01:46,208 --> 00:01:48,791
how you couldn't wait
to be a normal person.

26
00:01:48,875 --> 00:01:52,291
Do you still feel
the same way these days?

27
00:01:52,375 --> 00:01:53,666
Well, uh...

28
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,708
[MAKOTO gasps]
I gotta run!

29
00:01:55,791 --> 00:01:57,041
See ya 'round, Haru!

30
00:01:57,125 --> 00:01:58,500
And best of luck today!

31
00:01:58,583 --> 00:01:59,666
Thanks.

32
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,166
A normal person. Right.

33
00:02:14,333 --> 00:02:16,958
[IKUYA] I'm never gonna
be a normal person.

34
00:02:17,041 --> 00:02:18,583
[HIYORI]
Huh? Where'd that come from?

35
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:21,333
[IKUYA]
Nevermind. It's just a saying.

36
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:23,208
No need to worry about that.

37
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:25,708
You are extraordinary
and you always will be.

38
00:02:25,791 --> 00:02:27,833
You are Ikuya, after all.

39
00:02:27,916 --> 00:02:29,458
Are you sure that's
a good thing?

40
00:02:29,541 --> 00:02:32,750
'Course it is! What's
wrong? Are you mad?

41
00:02:32,833 --> 00:02:34,250
I'm fine.

42
00:04:16,125 --> 00:04:17,541
[DAVID]
Oi, Rin, ya done?

43
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:19,875
Nah, I'm gonna swim
a little longer.

44
00:04:19,958 --> 00:04:22,041
[DAVID]
Okay. Have fun then.

45
00:04:22,125 --> 00:04:24,416
Yeah, thanks, I'll
see you tomorrow.

46
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:36,791
[RIN laughs] Oh, man, those
goofballs never change.

47
00:04:58,625 --> 00:05:01,875
[ASAHI gasps]
Hang on. Don't I know you?

48
00:05:01,958 --> 00:05:03,791
Nanase? Haruka Nanase?

49
00:05:03,875 --> 00:05:05,291
You do remember me, right?

50
00:05:05,375 --> 00:05:07,291
It was a long time ago, but...

51
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:08,625
[gasps]

52
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:13,500
[HARUKA]
Wait. Yeah, Asahi Shiina!

53
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:15,958
Aw, I knew you couldn't
forget this face!

54
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:17,500
It's been a hot minute.

55
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:20,250
I don't think I've seen you
since we were in middle school!

56
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,000
This is too crazy!

57
00:05:22,083 --> 00:05:24,666
How come you don't look all
that excited to see me?

58
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:27,291
I guess that's just par for
the course with you, huh?

59
00:05:27,375 --> 00:05:29,125
You haven't changed much!

60
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:30,583
Well, neither have you.

61
00:05:30,666 --> 00:05:32,375
Sorry, but that's
where you're wrong.

62
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:34,583
Can't you tell how
mature I've gotten?

63
00:05:34,666 --> 00:05:35,875
By the way, guess what!

64
00:05:35,958 --> 00:05:38,333
You remember Kisumi
Shigino, don't you?

65
00:05:38,416 --> 00:05:40,458
He's going to this college, too!

66
00:05:40,541 --> 00:05:41,958
Yeah, I knew that.

67
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:43,916
Aw, man, I wanted to tell you!

68
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,625
So, did you guys go to high
school together, or what?

69
00:05:46,708 --> 00:05:48,625
Nope. Different schools.

70
00:05:48,708 --> 00:05:50,250
His younger brother
takes swimming lessons

71
00:05:50,333 --> 00:05:52,166
at the Iwatobi SC though.

72
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,750
So I saw him again there.

73
00:05:53,833 --> 00:05:55,208
SC?

74
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,375
[HARUKA] Anyway, you
still swimming, Asahi?

75
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:04,125
Uh-- Well, yeah,
why wouldn't I be?

76
00:06:04,208 --> 00:06:06,458
In fact, starting
practice here today.

77
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:08,500
What about you though?

78
00:06:08,583 --> 00:06:11,500
Didn't you quit doing
Swim Club after I moved?

79
00:06:11,583 --> 00:06:14,166
You never answered
my letters, so...

80
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,416
[HARUKA]
Sorry.

81
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,416
But, yeah, I started
swimming again

82
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,083
after I got to high school.

83
00:06:19,166 --> 00:06:20,916
I'm headed to practice now, too.

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,916
Wow, really? That's awesome.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,541
I can't wait to compete on
the same team as you again!

86
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:26,750
Same here.

87
00:06:26,833 --> 00:06:28,083
[ASAHI chuckles]

88
00:06:29,125 --> 00:06:31,541
[TSUKAMOTO]
Listen carefully, first-years.

89
00:06:31,625 --> 00:06:33,083
My name's Coach Tsukmoto.

90
00:06:33,166 --> 00:06:36,041
Welcome to your first
swim team practice with us.

91
00:06:36,125 --> 00:06:37,666
Let me make one thing clear.

92
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:38,833
You're not gonna have time

93
00:06:38,916 --> 00:06:40,625
for your typical college
shenanigans here.

94
00:06:40,708 --> 00:06:43,791
You'll be way too busy for
part-time jobs and partying.

95
00:06:43,875 --> 00:06:47,166
Stay focused at all times!

96
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:48,416
Now then.

97
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:50,500
I want all our newcomers
to introduce themselves

98
00:06:50,583 --> 00:06:53,375
one at a time and demonstrate
their best stroke for us.

99
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:54,541
Come on, line up!

100
00:06:54,625 --> 00:06:56,291
[SWIM TEAM]
Yes, sir!

101
00:06:56,375 --> 00:06:58,666
[RIN grunts]

102
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:00,916
[WILSON]
Ah, Rin, you're still here.

103
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,875
Good timing, actually.

104
00:07:02,958 --> 00:07:04,875
[RIN]
Hey there, Coach.

105
00:07:04,958 --> 00:07:07,083
I want to introduce somebody.

106
00:07:07,166 --> 00:07:09,875
Rin, this is my
good friend, Mikhail.

107
00:07:09,958 --> 00:07:11,250
<i>Konnichiwa</i> , Rin- <i>kun</i> .

108
00:07:11,333 --> 00:07:13,708
Wil has told me a
great deal about you.

109
00:07:13,791 --> 00:07:15,000
"Rin- <i>kun</i> "?

110
00:07:15,083 --> 00:07:17,625
[WILSON]
He's lived in Japan.

111
00:07:17,708 --> 00:07:19,833
You've got some
impressive muscles there!

112
00:07:19,916 --> 00:07:23,000
Oh so glad to meet
you, Mr. Matsuoka.

113
00:07:23,083 --> 00:07:26,791
Uh. Yeah, nice to meet you, too.

114
00:07:26,875 --> 00:07:27,625
[TSUKAMOTO]
Next!

115
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:29,250
I swim freestyle.

116
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:31,416
My name's Haruka Nanase.

117
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:33,875
[ASAHI]
Hey, Haru.

118
00:07:33,958 --> 00:07:37,250
You still goin' around
sayin' you only swim free?

119
00:07:37,333 --> 00:07:41,541
[HARUKA] No. I'll do
other strokes at practice.

120
00:07:41,625 --> 00:07:42,750
But...

121
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:47,333
When I swim for real,
I swim free.

122
00:07:54,583 --> 00:07:57,000
[ASAHI laughs]
Haru's still got it!

123
00:07:57,083 --> 00:07:58,625
How 'bout that?

124
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:03,625
[panting]

125
00:08:03,708 --> 00:08:05,583
Rin- <i>kun</i> , cho-very good!

126
00:08:05,666 --> 00:08:07,916
I'm sorry, what did you say?

127
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,625
It's Japanese slang
for "really amazing"!

128
00:08:11,708 --> 00:08:14,000
[ASAHI]
Speeding up on the turn!

129
00:08:14,083 --> 00:08:15,625
[MIKOSHIBA]
That's a nice kick!

130
00:08:19,333 --> 00:08:20,583
[laughs]

131
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:25,541
[BOTH gasp]

132
00:08:25,625 --> 00:08:27,291
[SWIM TEAM gasps]

133
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,166
[SUZUKI]
Great work, Nanase!

134
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,375
Yeah, you know.

135
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,375
I saw you swim free
before, at nationals.

136
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,416
I got to go last year.

137
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,666
No way!

138
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:47,416
You didn't tell me you
went to nationals, Haru!

139
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:48,958
Our team almost
qualified to go, too,

140
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:50,833
but we just barely missed out.

141
00:08:50,916 --> 00:08:52,333
Oh, that's too bad.

142
00:08:52,416 --> 00:08:54,250
I was at nationals last year.

143
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:57,208
Swam the 200 free.
Name's Isana Kiryuu.

144
00:08:57,291 --> 00:08:58,958
And I'm Hikaru Unita.

145
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,833
Came here from Hokkaido.

146
00:09:00,916 --> 00:09:02,166
He's our guy.

147
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,833
Everybody calls him the
King Salmon of the North.

148
00:09:04,916 --> 00:09:06,958
Stop fishin' for compliments!

149
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,708
Oh, that's cool, I guess.

150
00:09:08,791 --> 00:09:10,958
[HIKARU] Come on,
you're supposed to laugh!

151
00:09:11,041 --> 00:09:12,333
Listen, first-years,

152
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:14,833
college is a whole different
animal than high school.

153
00:09:14,916 --> 00:09:16,166
Don't get careless.

154
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:17,333
[BOTH]
Uh, yes, sir!

155
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:18,375
And don't forget,

156
00:09:18,458 --> 00:09:20,500
the newcomer
tournament's next week.

157
00:09:20,583 --> 00:09:23,166
The first-years from all the
best college teams in Kanto

158
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:24,375
are gonna be there,

159
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,125
so I want all of you
to bring your A-game!

00:09:27,458 --> 00:09:29,166
Yes, sir, Coach. Coming!

162
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:31,208
From the looks of it,
Mikoshiba's swimming style's

163
00:09:31,291 --> 00:09:32,750
all about raw power.

164
00:09:32,833 --> 00:09:35,083
I've watched him
in tournament races.

165
00:09:35,166 --> 00:09:36,750
Oh, yeah, you and
Mikoshiba already

166
00:09:36,833 --> 00:09:38,208
know each other, right, Haru?

167
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,416
Yeah, we do.

168
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,583
We went to different
high schools, though.

169
00:09:41,666 --> 00:09:44,250
Hey, I was wondering.
Where's Makoto?

170
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:46,250
D'you know if he's doing okay?

171
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:48,750
He's living in Tokyo now, too.

172
00:09:50,041 --> 00:09:51,458
[SAOTOME]
Oh, gosh.

173
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,708
I really hope I'll be able
to keep up with this lecture.

174
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:55,833
If you want, I could
let you borrow my notes.

175
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,750
Would you?

176
00:09:56,833 --> 00:09:59,958
--Sure. Uh-- Oh.
--[phone buzzes]

177
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:01,291
Who's Nagisa?

178
00:10:01,375 --> 00:10:03,791
Is that your girlfriend
or something?

179
00:10:03,875 --> 00:10:05,291
No, he's actually a guy

180
00:10:05,375 --> 00:10:08,541
I used to swim with
in high school.

181
00:10:08,625 --> 00:10:12,083
[NAGISA]
Whoa! Mako replies really fast!

182
00:10:12,166 --> 00:10:15,583
[GOU] Sure it's okay to
bug him? He might be in class.

183
00:10:15,666 --> 00:10:17,583
[REI] I don't think Makoto's
the type of person

184
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:20,000
who would reply to a text
message during a lecture.

185
00:10:20,083 --> 00:10:21,291
[gasps]

186
00:10:21,375 --> 00:10:22,541
[NAGISA]
What, is that all?

187
00:10:22,625 --> 00:10:24,208
[REI] All you said
was that we'd acquired

188
00:10:24,291 --> 00:10:25,583
three new members.

189
00:10:25,666 --> 00:10:27,375
He probably didn't know how
else to respond to that.

190
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:29,000
Okay, then we'll just
have to give him

191
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,500
some more information, yeah?

192
00:10:31,583 --> 00:10:32,625
Come over here, you three.

193
00:10:32,708 --> 00:10:35,000
We need to take a
quick photo of you!

194
00:10:35,083 --> 00:10:37,000
[ROMIO, SHIZURU, AYUMU]
Oh! Okay!

195
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:38,625
[NAGISA]
Let's start with you, Romi!

196
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:40,333
Gimme a big smile!

197
00:10:41,666 --> 00:10:43,666
[NAGISA]
Shizu, you're up next!

198
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:46,416
[REI]
Come on now, don't be so rigid!

199
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,375
[NAGISA]
Now you, Ayumu!

200
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:50,625
[GOU] You know you can
relax a little, right?

201
00:10:50,708 --> 00:10:52,250
Um, okay.

202
00:10:52,333 --> 00:10:54,666
So, Ayumu, if you had to
pick a favorite muscle,

203
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:55,833
which one would it be?

204
00:10:55,916 --> 00:10:58,583
Oh, uh. I'm not really
that into muscles.

205
00:10:58,666 --> 00:11:00,916
What, who doesn't like muscle?

206
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,791
[AYUMU]
I don't mind them, but I prefer

207
00:11:02,875 --> 00:11:04,625
people with a little
fat on them.

208
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:07,041
This might not be the
right club for you!

209
00:11:07,125 --> 00:11:08,250
[REI]
Oh, dear.

210
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,666
Is it me, or do these
look like mugshots?

211
00:11:10,750 --> 00:11:12,416
Yeah, they kinda do.

212
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,416
Then why don't we
take one together!

213
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:17,166
Come on, guys, get
into your swimsuits!

214
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,333
I have to say, it's a
little bit strange

215
00:11:19,416 --> 00:11:22,291
that I'm the one you're
asking to take your picture.

216
00:11:22,375 --> 00:11:23,833
But all right!

217
00:11:23,916 --> 00:11:26,166
I'll make sure it's the best
group photograph you ever saw!

218
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,041
As the saying goes.

219
00:11:28,125 --> 00:11:30,083
"Only a mortal can
capture a photograph

220
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:31,666
that's fit for the gods."

221
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,916
"Miracles don't--"

222
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,416
[NAGISA] Sorry, Miss A,
we don't have all day!

223
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,666
[AMAKATA]
Ah! Okay!

224
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:37,458
Now, pay very close attention.

225
00:11:37,541 --> 00:11:39,291
Photography theory
tells us that if we--

226
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:41,083
[camera clicks]

227
00:11:41,166 --> 00:11:44,291
[GOU]
Ha! You were saying, Mr. Expert?

228
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:46,208
That is far from beautiful.

229
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:47,541
Get back together so we
can take another one--

230
00:11:47,625 --> 00:11:49,166
[NAGISA]
Okay, and off it goes!

231
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,500
[yelps] No!

232
00:11:51,583 --> 00:11:52,583
[GOU]
It's so you!

233
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,333
[REI]
What is that supposed to mean?

234
00:11:55,291 --> 00:11:59,583
[MAKOTO chuckles]
That's our Rei.

235
00:11:59,666 --> 00:12:01,125
[phone buzzes]

236
00:12:01,208 --> 00:12:02,958
[MAKOTO]
Haru?

237
00:12:03,041 --> 00:12:04,958
[VOICE]
Hey, Makoto, it's me.

238
00:12:05,041 --> 00:12:07,000
Huh? That isn't Haruka's voice.

239
00:12:07,083 --> 00:12:09,250
[ASAHI]
Aw, man, he didn't buy it!

240
00:12:09,333 --> 00:12:11,916
Who is this? Is Haru
there with you?

241
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,666
Sure is, and Kisumi's
with us, too!

242
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,083
With who?

243
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:18,750
[KISUMI] Hey, Makoto!
That musta been weird.

244
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,083
You were expecting
Haru and got Asahi.

245
00:12:21,166 --> 00:12:22,541
Hey! Dammit, Kisumi.

246
00:12:22,625 --> 00:12:24,875
Why'd you hafta go and let
the cat out of the bag?

247
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:28,375
Asahi? Wait, you
mean that Asahi?

248
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:32,625
Yep, the one and only.
Did you miss me?

249
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:38,083
[MAKOTO] So your sister runs
this whole restaurant?

250
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:40,916
[AKANE] Well, it originally
belonged to my mother-in-law.

251
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:42,916
She managed it for a long time.

252
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,791
[ASAHI] Yeah, so now Akane
basically owns the place.

253
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:48,375
Whatever you want,
it's on the house.

254
00:12:48,458 --> 00:12:51,166
Wait, I'm sorry, but you
do have to pay your bill.

255
00:12:51,250 --> 00:12:52,375
Aw, come on, sis.

256
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,750
There's no need to be stingy.

257
00:12:53,833 --> 00:12:56,875
[AKANE]
I have to! This is a business.

258
00:12:56,958 --> 00:12:58,583
Anyway, Makoto,
you sure look like

259
00:12:58,666 --> 00:13:01,416
you've grown a lot since
last time I saw you.

260
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,416
Oh, yeah, he's a big man now!

261
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,916
Thanks. But you've
changed, too, Asahi.

262
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Like, your face looks older.

263
00:13:07,583 --> 00:13:09,333
Not too old, right?

264
00:13:09,416 --> 00:13:12,333
Oh, hey, Haru says that
you've decided on your major.

265
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:14,541
Sports education
sounds interesting.

266
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:16,500
So, you wanna be a
swimming teacher, then?

267
00:13:16,583 --> 00:13:18,291
Yeah, I figured
teaching kids how fun

268
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:20,750
swimming is would be
the perfect job for me.

269
00:13:20,833 --> 00:13:22,791
He's right, sounds
just like him.

270
00:13:22,875 --> 00:13:24,916
If I remember right,
you moved to Kyushu

271
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,375
after you left
Iwatobi, didn't you?

272
00:13:27,458 --> 00:13:29,458
Were you able to keep swimming?

273
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:31,375
[ASAHI] Yeah, for a while,
but then I transferred

274
00:13:31,458 --> 00:13:33,500
to Kazami High School
not too long after that,

275
00:13:33,583 --> 00:13:35,791
and they didn't have a
swim club when I got there.

276
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,166
Can you believe it?

277
00:13:37,250 --> 00:13:39,416
It took a lot of doing,
but I managed to rustle up

278
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,583
enough members to start
a club on my own.

279
00:13:41,666 --> 00:13:44,625
[MAKOTO] Wow, you, too?
That's what we did!

280
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:47,250
We started Iwatobi Swim Club
with some friends.

281
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:48,500
Tell him about it.

282
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:51,333
Yeah. First we had to
fix up the pool, though.

283
00:13:51,416 --> 00:13:53,041
[ASAHI]
Really? So did we!

284
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,166
That's a lot harder work
than I thought it'd be.

285
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,250
It took us forever to scrub
all that moss out!

286
00:13:58,333 --> 00:14:00,041
Ooh, wanna see some pictures?

287
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,333
What, of the moss?

288
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,708
[ASAHI]
No, genius!

289
00:14:03,791 --> 00:14:06,416
[ASAHI] See? These are my
old buddies from high school.

290
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,875
[KISUMI]
Huh.

291
00:14:07,958 --> 00:14:10,291
And this is a picture of my
old swim team from Kyushu.

292
00:14:10,375 --> 00:14:13,416
We kicked major butt at
the junior tournament.

293
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:14,333
[KISUMI]
Eighth grade?

294
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:16,458
[ASAHI]
Ninth grade, I think.

295
00:14:16,541 --> 00:14:17,666
Oh, then there's this one.

296
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:20,583
[gasps] Look, I'm so little!

297
00:14:20,666 --> 00:14:23,750
[KISUMI laughs] Look how
young and innocent Haru is!

298
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,500
I'm still young and innocent.

299
00:14:25,583 --> 00:14:27,125
That's a weird thing to say.

300
00:14:27,208 --> 00:14:29,000
You look like a monkey, Asahi.

301
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:30,875
Hey! You take that back!

302
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:33,083
Wait a sec! There's Ikuya!

303
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:34,791
Wonder what he's been up to.

304
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:38,375
Uh-oh. Something wrong?

305
00:14:38,458 --> 00:14:40,333
Not really, it's just
that I never got a chance

306
00:14:40,416 --> 00:14:43,750
to tell Ikuya I was moving
away before I left Iwatobi.

307
00:14:43,833 --> 00:14:44,916
Well, uh...

308
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,208
He actually followed
Natsuya to America

309
00:14:47,291 --> 00:14:49,416
from eighth grade up.

310
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,666
I'm not sure if he's still
doing any swimming, though.

311
00:14:52,750 --> 00:14:54,250
We'll never make
friends like we had

312
00:14:54,333 --> 00:14:56,375
back then, that's for sure.

313
00:14:56,458 --> 00:14:58,958
Hey, that almost sounded
like a line out of a movie!

314
00:14:59,041 --> 00:15:01,416
What are you tryin' to sound
all cool and stuff for?

315
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:03,125
And why do you have to
talk about "back then"

316
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:04,375
like it's ancient history?

317
00:15:04,458 --> 00:15:06,958
We're still friends now,
aren't we? Ya big dope.

318
00:15:07,041 --> 00:15:08,541
[AKANE]
Reel it in, you two.

319
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,875
You guys're way too young
to sit here reminiscing

320
00:15:10,958 --> 00:15:12,750
like you're a bunch
of old geezers.

321
00:15:12,833 --> 00:15:15,125
You need to enjoy your youth
while you've got it.

322
00:15:15,208 --> 00:15:16,000
Know what I mean?

323
00:15:16,083 --> 00:15:17,125
Ha! Guess you're right.

324
00:15:17,208 --> 00:15:19,250
Yeah, we need to
live in the present.

325
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:20,875
Which is why we gotta
roll up our sleeves

326
00:15:20,958 --> 00:15:22,625
and aim for the big leagues now!

327
00:15:22,708 --> 00:15:24,750
True, that's one way
you could do it.

328
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:26,666
Well, you wanna make it big?

329
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:29,000
Then first you have to win
the All-Japan Invitational

330
00:15:29,083 --> 00:15:30,625
and get onto the national team.

331
00:15:30,708 --> 00:15:31,916
And before any of that,

332
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,958
there's the newcomer
tournament, too.

333
00:15:34,041 --> 00:15:35,500
[AKANE]
Oh, you're talking about the

334
00:15:35,583 --> 00:15:39,208
Intercollegiate Newcomer
Swimming Tournament, right?

335
00:15:39,291 --> 00:15:41,291
My husband's supposed
to be covering that.

336
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,541
"Covering"?

337
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,583
Oh, yeah, she's married
to a sports journalist.

338
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:46,166
Sounds like a cool
job, doesn't it?

339
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:48,041
[KISUMI]
Whoa, that's amazing!

340
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,875
[MAKOTO] So that's why
there are so many pictures

341
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:51,916
and news articles
hanging up in here.

342
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,125
[ASAHI]
Uh-huh!

343
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:55,166
Funny enough, after
that last tournament...

344
00:16:11,125 --> 00:16:12,833
Ikuya!

345
00:16:17,583 --> 00:16:19,250
[ALL]
Haru!

346
00:16:22,375 --> 00:16:25,791
[ASAHI] Crap! We were
so close to victory!

347
00:16:25,875 --> 00:16:28,083
Yeah, and we tried
so hard, too.

348
00:16:28,166 --> 00:16:29,916
But it still wasn't
enough, was it?

349
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,083
We're just gonna have to
practice more from now on!

350
00:16:33,166 --> 00:16:35,166
Yeah. You're right.

351
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:38,125
It's fine--we'll win the
next summer tournament.

352
00:16:38,208 --> 00:16:39,708
The four of us.

353
00:16:39,791 --> 00:16:40,791
[ASAHI]
Heck yeah!

354
00:16:40,875 --> 00:16:42,708
Let's start our
swimming boot camp!

355
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:43,708
Right now!

356
00:16:43,791 --> 00:16:45,583
[MAKOTO]
Hold on, slow down, Asahi!

357
00:16:45,666 --> 00:16:47,458
Don't you think it's a little
too early for all that?

358
00:16:47,541 --> 00:16:49,125
[ASAHI]
Yeah, well, I can't help it!

359
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,916
I'm so pissed off
about losing today,

360
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,416
I wanna get to work
as fast as I can!

361
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:05,625
[DOCTOR 1A] Hm. Your shoulder
looks much better.

362
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:09,375
You can try swimming again,
as long as you don't overdo it.

363
00:17:09,458 --> 00:17:11,458
All right?

364
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,750
Thanks.

365
00:17:17,666 --> 00:17:18,750
[sighs]

366
00:17:18,833 --> 00:17:20,333
[knocking]

367
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:24,250
Sosuke. Employee dinner.

368
00:17:24,333 --> 00:17:26,000
You hungry? Dig in!

369
00:17:26,083 --> 00:17:28,375
Oh, thanks a lot, Kazuma.

370
00:17:28,458 --> 00:17:30,916
What you workin' so
hard on over here?

371
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,041
Sorry to barge in.

372
00:17:32,125 --> 00:17:34,083
It's cool. I mean,
I never get very far

373
00:17:34,166 --> 00:17:36,625
when I sit down to
write a letter anyway.

374
00:17:36,708 --> 00:17:39,125
[KAZUMA] Yeah, I suck
at stuff like that, too.

375
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,041
[KAZUMA laughs]
Listen, don't worry too much

376
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,458
about the family.

377
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,875
And I can handle the
restaurant myself.

378
00:17:46,958 --> 00:17:49,625
I'll be taking things over
eventually, after all.

379
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:51,458
Changing the name.

380
00:17:51,541 --> 00:17:53,166
How's "Restaurant Kazuma"?

381
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,416
Getting ahead of
yourself, aren't ya?

382
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:56,541
Better believe it.

383
00:17:56,625 --> 00:17:58,041
You have fun with that.

384
00:17:58,125 --> 00:18:00,041
[BOTH laugh]

385
00:18:00,125 --> 00:18:01,875
[NITORI]
Nanase's at a tournament?

386
00:18:01,958 --> 00:18:04,125
Wait, you mean
that newcomer one?

387
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,500
[NAGISA]
Yup! Apparently, he met up with

388
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:08,625
a couple of guys he used
to do medley relays with

389
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:10,583
back in middle school,
and now they're all gonna be

390
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,708
on the same college
swim team together!

391
00:18:12,791 --> 00:18:15,416
I think their names
are Asahi and Ikuya!

392
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,666
That's mostly right, except
I believe he only met up

393
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:19,750
with one of them.

394
00:18:19,833 --> 00:18:21,791
[GOU]
It's a little confusing.

395
00:18:21,875 --> 00:18:23,375
From what I could tell,
the team member that

396
00:18:23,458 --> 00:18:26,583
Haru's already been in contact
with is named Asahi Shiina,

397
00:18:26,666 --> 00:18:30,875
and the one he hasn't heard
from is named Ikuya Kirishima.

398
00:18:30,958 --> 00:18:33,666
Wait, that Kirishima?

399
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,916
Do you know that guy, Sosuke?

400
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,666
[SOSUKE]
Yeah. I've seen him compete.

401
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,708
[SOSUKE]
His style was incredibly smooth.

402
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:47,750
[REI]
At the last tournament?

403
00:18:47,833 --> 00:18:50,625
You mean in the individual
medley, not the relay.

404
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:52,416
Yeah. And his freestyle...

405
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:54,708
It looked almost
exactly like Haru's.

406
00:18:54,791 --> 00:18:56,708
[NAGISA]
What? You're kidding!

407
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,083
[REI]
I see.

408
00:18:58,166 --> 00:19:00,291
Perhaps, like me, he was
enchanted by Haruka's

409
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,166
beautiful freestyle
and decided to adopt

410
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,666
that technique for himself.

411
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:05,375
If that's the case,
then maybe he's also

412
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,458
swimming at a Tokyo university!

413
00:19:07,541 --> 00:19:09,666
If nothing else, I bet he
and Nanase'll meet again

414
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:11,750
at the newcomer
tournament today!

415
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:33,375
Okay. This is the place.

416
00:19:34,458 --> 00:19:36,208
[MAKOTO]
Hey, Kisumi.

417
00:19:36,291 --> 00:19:37,708
[KISUMI]
What's taking you so long?

418
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:40,791
Sorry. My train got delayed.

419
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:41,958
[KISUMI]
Hurry up!

420
00:19:42,041 --> 00:19:44,541
Haru and Asahi's race
is about to start!

421
00:19:44,625 --> 00:19:47,541
Yeah, I'm trying. Where are you?

422
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:48,708
[KISUMI]
I'm in the audience,

423
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:49,958
right in the middle
of the second level.

424
00:19:50,041 --> 00:19:52,708
If you head upstairs,
you should see me.

425
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,958
Cool, be right there.

426
00:19:55,041 --> 00:19:57,375
[laughs] It's been forever
since the last time

427
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:59,500
you and I raced each other.

428
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:01,458
You do remember
what I said to you

429
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:04,375
back in middle school,
don't you, Haru?

430
00:20:04,458 --> 00:20:06,750
I'll catch up with you soon!

431
00:20:06,833 --> 00:20:08,375
Oh, did you say that to me?

432
00:20:08,458 --> 00:20:09,500
You forgot that?

433
00:20:09,583 --> 00:20:10,958
C'mon, when someone
declares war,

434
00:20:11,041 --> 00:20:13,083
the least you can do
is remember it!

435
00:20:13,166 --> 00:20:14,541
Guess that means
we've been at war

436
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:15,750
for six years, then.

437
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:17,000
Uh-huh.

438
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,916
At the time, seeing
that freestyle of yours

439
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,833
got me so shaken up that
I couldn't even swim.

440
00:20:21,916 --> 00:20:24,208
But that's not happening again.

441
00:20:24,291 --> 00:20:26,500
Just made it, barely!

442
00:20:26,583 --> 00:20:28,125
[KISUMI]
Yeah, that was close!

443
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:30,041
This is the first time
I've seen Asahi swim

444
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,583
since middle school.

445
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,583
Right, same here.

446
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,541
[KISUMI] So regardless
of who wins or loses,

447
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:37,208
everyone who beats
a certain time

448
00:20:37,291 --> 00:20:39,541
goes to the All-Japan
Invitational, yeah?

449
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:41,416
[MAKOTO] No, this is
a newcomer tournament,

450
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,166
so no matter how good
their times are,

451
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:45,250
there's no guarantee any
of them will get selected

452
00:20:45,333 --> 00:20:47,416
to move on to All-Japan.

453
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:51,250
Still. It's their first
college competition.

454
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:55,708
Which means this is a huge
debut for Haru and Asahi!

455
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,500
[ANNOUNCER 1A]
Take your marks.

456
00:20:59,416 --> 00:21:01,375
--[beep]
--[CROWD] Go!

457
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:05,916
--Go, Asahi!
--[MAKOTO] Haru!

458
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:08,875
Look how fast they are!

459
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,500
That Shiina guy has got
some serious talent,

460
00:21:14,583 --> 00:21:16,041
check it out.

461
00:21:16,125 --> 00:21:18,708
Who knew there would be so many
impressive first-years here?

462
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:21,208
Guess I can't afford
to get lazy.

463
00:21:23,625 --> 00:21:25,666
[MAKOTO]
They're picking up more speed!

464
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:28,500
[panting]

465
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:32,625
[KISUMI]
Whoa! They're way ahead!

466
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:37,708
That doesn't impress me.

467
00:21:37,791 --> 00:21:41,750
Big deal. Just inferior
copies of Ikuya.

468
00:21:44,250 --> 00:21:46,375
[CROWD cheers]

469
00:21:46,458 --> 00:21:50,250
[ASAHI] Agh, man! I'm so
gonna own you next time.

470
00:21:50,333 --> 00:21:52,041
Nah, I'll beat you again.

471
00:21:52,125 --> 00:21:54,708
Oh, what makes you so confident?

472
00:21:54,791 --> 00:21:56,250
You're still just
as smug as you were

473
00:21:56,333 --> 00:21:58,000
in our middle school days.

[HARUKA gasps]

475
00:22:03,083 --> 00:22:05,708
What's up? You okay there, Haru?

476
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:10,416
[HARUKA]
Ikuya?

477
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,416
[NAGISA] The gears of fate
have started to turn.

478
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,041
Get ready for a big reunion!

479
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,583
Next time: "A Promise
on a Shooting Star!"

480
00:22:16,666 --> 00:22:17,625
[REI]
Wonder what thoughts

481
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:19,541
are passing through
Haruka's mind.
