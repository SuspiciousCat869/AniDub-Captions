1
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,552
[MAKOTO]
All right!

2
00:00:20,635 --> 00:00:21,678
That's it for today.

3
00:00:21,761 --> 00:00:24,556
[KIDS]
Thank you, Coach Tachibana!

4
00:00:24,639 --> 00:00:27,976
You all be careful
on your way home.

5
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:32,564
[MISAKI] Hey, Coach? Is it okay
if I swim for a little longer?

6
00:00:32,647 --> 00:00:33,857
No problem.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,650
I'll be here for a while,
too, so let me know

8
00:00:35,734 --> 00:00:36,860
if you need anything.

9
00:00:36,943 --> 00:00:39,195
'Kay, I will!

10
00:00:39,279 --> 00:00:42,407
[AZUMA]
That kid's got some enthusiasm.

11
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:44,576
So, seems we meet again.

12
00:00:44,659 --> 00:00:46,911
[MAKOTO]
What are you doing here?

13
00:00:46,995 --> 00:00:48,455
I wanted him to coach me.

14
00:00:48,538 --> 00:00:49,873
[MAKOTO]
Really?

15
00:00:49,956 --> 00:00:52,167
Don't worry. It's not anything
official or permanent.

16
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,626
I'm not about to drop everything

17
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:55,670
and start working
at your college.

18
00:00:55,754 --> 00:00:56,921
Relax.

19
00:00:57,005 --> 00:00:58,923
Just think of these as
a few private lessons.

20
00:00:59,007 --> 00:01:00,342
Yeah, but...

21
00:01:00,425 --> 00:01:03,178
I heard you were a famous coach,
and you worked overseas.

22
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:07,057
Haru. Don't you think this
could be kinda... expensive?

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,808
I'm not worried about the money.

24
00:01:08,892 --> 00:01:11,186
He can just buy me
dinner or somethin'.

25
00:01:11,269 --> 00:01:15,690
I'm not picky. As long
as it's not mackerel.

26
00:01:15,774 --> 00:01:16,941
I'm ready when you are.

27
00:01:17,025 --> 00:01:19,694
Well, you're not wastin'
any time, I see.

28
00:01:20,779 --> 00:01:22,405
Haru...

29
00:02:53,913 --> 00:02:55,957
[KISUMI]
I'm so bored.

30
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:58,710
Everybody else has been
so busy with practice lately,

31
00:02:58,793 --> 00:03:00,754
they haven't had any
time to hang out.

32
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:02,464
Plus Makoto has his job.

33
00:03:02,547 --> 00:03:04,341
[AKANE]
Aw, poor baby.

34
00:03:04,424 --> 00:03:07,135
Their college championships
are coming up, remember?

35
00:03:07,218 --> 00:03:09,763
They can't participate in
the All-Japan Invitational

36
00:03:09,846 --> 00:03:12,349
unless they can beat
the qualifying time.

37
00:03:12,432 --> 00:03:14,017
[KISUMI]
Yeah, I don't think Haru'll have

38
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,727
any trouble with that, though.

39
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:18,313
'Course Asahi's
the problem child.

40
00:03:18,396 --> 00:03:21,858
He acts tough, but he's a lot
more fragile than he looks.

41
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:24,861
--Oh? [laughs]
--[door bell chimes]

42
00:03:24,944 --> 00:03:26,988
Hey, sis. I'm starving!

43
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:28,365
Can you make something?

44
00:03:28,448 --> 00:03:30,241
Sure, I'll see what I can do.

45
00:03:30,325 --> 00:03:31,618
[ASAHI]
So, what's goin' on?

46
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:32,911
Eh, nothin' really.

47
00:03:32,994 --> 00:03:34,954
Just talkin' about how
soon the tournament is.

48
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:36,456
Y'ready?

49
00:03:36,539 --> 00:03:38,792
[ASAHI] Will be! I'm starting
bright and early tomorrow!

50
00:03:38,875 --> 00:03:41,252
Come on, Akane,
I'm dyin' over here!

51
00:03:41,336 --> 00:03:43,046
Sorry, but it looks like
we might be short

52
00:03:43,129 --> 00:03:46,383
on ingredients for dinner.
I'm gonna run to the store.

53
00:03:46,466 --> 00:03:47,550
Watch Tsukushi for me?

54
00:03:47,634 --> 00:03:48,802
Sure.

55
00:03:50,053 --> 00:03:51,846
Uh-oh, I think he
wants you, Kisumi.

56
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,807
Aw, cut it out!

57
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:55,392
No love for Uncle Asahi.

58
00:03:55,475 --> 00:03:58,103
[AKANE laughs]
Well, I'll leave you to it.

59
00:03:58,186 --> 00:03:59,979
[ASAHI]
Hey, easy there, Skushi.

60
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:01,439
Why don't you come to--

61
00:04:01,523 --> 00:04:03,650
[KISUMI]
Whoa, that looked like it hurt!

62
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:06,861
[ASAHI]
He's got a good kick on him.

63
00:04:06,945 --> 00:04:09,280
Well then, I'd better
be on my way.

64
00:04:09,364 --> 00:04:10,740
Have a good night.

65
00:04:10,824 --> 00:04:14,411
And don't forget, you owe me
a plate of cafeteria soba.

66
00:04:14,494 --> 00:04:15,954
See ya.

67
00:04:17,122 --> 00:04:19,541
Maybe this guy's not so bad.

68
00:04:19,624 --> 00:04:21,334
Yeah, I guess.

69
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:24,921
[MAKOTO]
That was surprising though.

70
00:04:25,005 --> 00:04:28,633
Never thought you'd arrange
something like that yourself.

71
00:04:28,717 --> 00:04:30,844
[HARUKA]
I'm not quite sold on it.

72
00:04:30,927 --> 00:04:31,678
But still...

73
00:04:31,761 --> 00:04:33,054
Huh?

74
00:04:33,138 --> 00:04:34,848
[HARUKA]
It's for Ikuya.

75
00:04:37,684 --> 00:04:38,893
[MAKOTO]
Yeah.

76
00:04:48,903 --> 00:04:52,323
[pants]

77
00:04:52,407 --> 00:04:54,451
Hey, Kirishima. You okay?

78
00:04:54,534 --> 00:04:55,285
[IKUYA]
Yeah.

79
00:04:55,368 --> 00:04:56,911
This isn't like you.

80
00:04:56,995 --> 00:04:59,205
Your time keeps getting
worse and worse.

81
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:00,498
If this keeps up,

82
00:05:00,582 --> 00:05:02,834
you're not going to qualify
for the All-Japan.

83
00:05:02,917 --> 00:05:04,794
Yeah, I know that.

84
00:05:07,505 --> 00:05:09,049
[pants]

85
00:05:11,217 --> 00:05:12,635
[gasps]

86
00:05:15,513 --> 00:05:17,932
What's been going on with him?

87
00:05:18,016 --> 00:05:20,727
It's nothing. I'm sure
he's just stressin' out

88
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,188
because the tournament's
around the corner.

89
00:05:29,736 --> 00:05:32,322
[SAGAE] Today's regimen was
even tougher than usual!

90
00:05:32,405 --> 00:05:34,282
[TERASHIMA] Yeah, well, I'm
going for a tournament record,

91
00:05:34,366 --> 00:05:37,452
so if you ask me,
it wasn't tough enough.

92
00:05:37,535 --> 00:05:39,371
Anyway, what do you say
we go get some food?

93
00:05:39,454 --> 00:05:40,372
Well, I'm down!

94
00:05:40,455 --> 00:05:41,831
Wanna come along, Toono?

95
00:05:41,915 --> 00:05:42,999
Sorry.

96
00:05:43,083 --> 00:05:44,834
I'm really tired,
so I'm gonna go on home.

97
00:05:44,918 --> 00:05:45,877
Have fun though.

98
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:46,961
Suit yourself.

99
00:05:47,045 --> 00:05:49,839
How 'bout you,
Kirishima? You hungry?

100
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:51,508
[gasps]

101
00:05:51,591 --> 00:05:53,885
Huh? What's up with you two?

102
00:05:53,968 --> 00:05:55,261
Did you have a fight?

103
00:05:55,345 --> 00:05:57,389
No, it's nothin' like that.

104
00:05:57,472 --> 00:06:00,141
But sure, I'll come
eat with you, guys.

105
00:06:00,225 --> 00:06:01,267
See ya, Toono!

106
00:06:01,351 --> 00:06:02,394
Yeah, later!

107
00:06:02,477 --> 00:06:03,770
[HIYORI]
Bye.

108
00:06:09,234 --> 00:06:10,527
Ikuya...

109
00:06:19,411 --> 00:06:21,371
Come on.

110
00:06:21,454 --> 00:06:25,500
After all we've been through,
why's it have to be like this?

111
00:06:25,583 --> 00:06:26,835
[HIKARU]
Oh, yeah.

112
00:06:26,918 --> 00:06:29,379
Did you ever get a chance
to see Kirishima?

113
00:06:29,462 --> 00:06:30,588
Huh?

114
00:06:30,672 --> 00:06:32,966
I'm guessing you went
over to Shimogami U?

115
00:06:33,049 --> 00:06:35,343
Yeah, but we didn't
get to talk to him.

116
00:06:35,427 --> 00:06:36,970
Well, he is aiming
for the global level,

117
00:06:37,053 --> 00:06:38,221
so I'm sure he's pretty busy.

118
00:06:38,304 --> 00:06:40,724
And besides that, I hear
he's been in a slump.

119
00:06:40,807 --> 00:06:42,142
A slump?

120
00:06:42,225 --> 00:06:44,894
Hey, same here, my time isn't
improving at all lately!

121
00:06:44,978 --> 00:06:46,604
Only an athlete
who's reached the peak

122
00:06:46,688 --> 00:06:49,357
can fall into a slump, and you
don't fit that description.

123
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:52,360
Your problem is that you're not
working hard enough, Suzuki.

124
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,903
You're right, sorry!

125
00:06:53,987 --> 00:06:56,114
[MIKOSHIBA] Look, guys, the
college championships'll be here

126
00:06:56,197 --> 00:06:57,365
before we know it.

127
00:06:57,449 --> 00:06:59,909
We need to make the most
out of the time we have.

128
00:06:59,993 --> 00:07:01,661
That's the best way to win!

129
00:07:01,745 --> 00:07:03,621
[SWIM TEAM]
Right!

130
00:07:03,705 --> 00:07:06,249
[HIKARU] I really hope we can
ace the championships.

131
00:07:06,332 --> 00:07:08,918
And after that comes the
All-Japan tournament!

132
00:07:09,002 --> 00:07:10,420
[ASAHI] Yeah, but getting
there is probably

133
00:07:10,503 --> 00:07:13,506
gonna be a close call,
based on how I've been doing.

134
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:15,800
Wow, you owned right up to that.

135
00:07:15,884 --> 00:07:17,427
But I'm gonna stake
everything I've got

136
00:07:17,510 --> 00:07:19,012
on that close call!

137
00:07:19,095 --> 00:07:20,263
Yeah, I've noticed
you've really been

138
00:07:20,347 --> 00:07:22,599
giving 110 percent lately.

139
00:07:22,682 --> 00:07:24,517
You better believe it!

140
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:26,227
I aim for the top!

141
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:28,688
I've got more practice
lined up after this!

142
00:07:28,772 --> 00:07:31,941
Well, I'm not sure how
far I can feasibly go,

143
00:07:32,025 --> 00:07:34,694
but for the next four years,
I'm gonna give it all I've got.

144
00:07:34,778 --> 00:07:36,821
I've been dreaming of
competing at the global level

145
00:07:36,905 --> 00:07:39,783
ever since I was a little kid.

146
00:07:39,866 --> 00:07:41,368
Dreaming.

147
00:07:41,451 --> 00:07:43,620
So what are your plans, Nanase?

148
00:07:43,703 --> 00:07:46,289
Haven't you always wanted
to make it that far?

149
00:07:48,083 --> 00:07:49,542
[HARUKA]
Um...

150
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:53,171
[HARUKA] I'm from the
small town of Iwatobi.

151
00:07:53,254 --> 00:07:56,633
I always loved water.

152
00:07:56,716 --> 00:07:59,678
And I only swam free.

153
00:07:59,761 --> 00:08:01,554
My elementary school
teammates helped me

154
00:08:01,638 --> 00:08:03,431
realize how much fun
it could be to swim

155
00:08:03,515 --> 00:08:06,810
in relays instead of just solo.

156
00:08:06,893 --> 00:08:08,395
Then middle school
and high school

157
00:08:08,478 --> 00:08:12,899
brought new teammates,
and new experiences.

158
00:08:12,982 --> 00:08:15,360
Now I'm swimming here in Tokyo.

159
00:08:17,737 --> 00:08:21,533
[HARUKA] I feel like I've
come a really long way,

160
00:08:21,616 --> 00:08:24,285
But if you ask me where
I'm headed next...

161
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,955
[HARUKA]
I...

162
00:08:31,584 --> 00:08:32,669
Nanase.

163
00:08:32,752 --> 00:08:35,088
Your biggest weakness
is your mentality.

164
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,799
But it can also
be a great asset.

165
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:41,052
Mental fortitude is
essential for an athlete.

166
00:08:41,136 --> 00:08:45,223
Your mind is what decides how
good your results will be.

167
00:08:45,306 --> 00:08:47,976
You have plenty of
strength to unlock.

168
00:08:48,059 --> 00:08:52,105
This is my animal instinct
talking, of course.

169
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:53,189
One thing.

170
00:08:53,273 --> 00:08:54,774
What's that?

171
00:08:57,235 --> 00:09:00,321
We don't allow food or drinks
this close to the pool.

172
00:09:04,784 --> 00:09:06,578
[AZUMA]
Sorry.

173
00:09:06,661 --> 00:09:08,830
[phone ringing]

174
00:09:08,913 --> 00:09:09,998
[IKUYA]
Yeah.

175
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,001
[NATSUYA] Hey! I finally
got a hold of you.

176
00:09:13,084 --> 00:09:14,419
[IKUYA]
So, what do you want?

177
00:09:14,502 --> 00:09:16,838
[NATSUYA] Did you get my message
that I'm back in Japan?

178
00:09:16,921 --> 00:09:20,342
I'm in Tokyo now if you
wanna meet for dinner.

179
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,303
[IKUYA] Nah, the college
invitational is coming up.

180
00:09:23,386 --> 00:09:26,806
You're no fun.
How's your condition?

181
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:30,685
[IKUYA] I dunno. Nothing's
changed, so normal, I guess?

182
00:09:30,769 --> 00:09:32,187
[NATSUYA]
If you say so.

183
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,314
But don't push yourself too
hard if you're not up to it.

184
00:09:34,397 --> 00:09:38,651
You can still go global,
even if it's not this year.

185
00:09:38,735 --> 00:09:41,446
You could just sit this one out
and wait till you're better.

186
00:09:42,906 --> 00:09:44,699
[IKUYA]
Yeah, I know.

187
00:09:44,783 --> 00:09:48,119
[NATSUYA] Like it or not,
I'm comin' to see you race.

188
00:09:48,203 --> 00:09:50,413
[IKUYA] It doesn't matter
if you're there or not.

189
00:09:50,497 --> 00:09:52,582
I'm still gonna win.

190
00:09:52,665 --> 00:09:56,211
I have to win
at that tournament.

191
00:09:56,294 --> 00:09:59,964
[NATSUYA] Ikuya. Are you
sure everything's okay?

192
00:10:00,048 --> 00:10:01,841
[IKUYA]
I told you, I'm fine.

193
00:10:01,925 --> 00:10:04,386
I gotta get up early,
so I'll let you go.

194
00:10:13,687 --> 00:10:15,313
In that mermaid story,

195
00:10:15,397 --> 00:10:19,442
didn't she turn into
seafoam in the end?

196
00:10:19,526 --> 00:10:21,778
I'm not too fond
of it, actually.

197
00:10:24,989 --> 00:10:28,076
[IKUYA]
I'll win. I have to.

198
00:10:33,289 --> 00:10:34,374
[NAO]
Natsuya.

199
00:10:34,457 --> 00:10:35,375
Nao!

200
00:10:35,458 --> 00:10:37,252
Sorry. Am I late?

201
00:10:37,335 --> 00:10:40,964
Nah. I just got here,
too. Shall we?

202
00:10:46,302 --> 00:10:48,221
Been a long time, hasn't it?

203
00:10:48,304 --> 00:10:49,055
[NATSUYA]
Yeah.

204
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:50,223
Last time we saw each other,

205
00:10:50,306 --> 00:10:53,393
we weren't even old
enough to drink yet.

206
00:10:53,476 --> 00:10:54,644
Oh, right!

207
00:10:54,728 --> 00:10:56,688
Here's a souvenir from Sydney.

208
00:10:56,771 --> 00:10:59,399
Ooh, black tea! Thanks a lot.

209
00:10:59,482 --> 00:11:00,817
[chuckles]

210
00:11:01,985 --> 00:11:04,904
So, um. Been over to see Ikuya?

211
00:11:04,988 --> 00:11:06,656
I haven't had the chance yet.

212
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:09,367
He says he's busy preparing
for the tournament.

213
00:11:09,451 --> 00:11:10,869
I see.

214
00:11:10,952 --> 00:11:12,746
Why do you wanna know?

215
00:11:12,829 --> 00:11:14,748
Well, I talked to
Makoto, Haruka,

216
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:16,374
and Asahi the other day.

217
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:17,625
Oh, yeah?

218
00:11:17,709 --> 00:11:19,210
Can't believe they're
all in the same city.

219
00:11:19,294 --> 00:11:21,129
[NAO]
Mm-hm.

220
00:11:21,212 --> 00:11:24,299
They mentioned that Ikuya's
been struggling lately.

221
00:11:24,382 --> 00:11:25,800
[sighs]

222
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:29,220
I'm not surprised.

223
00:11:29,304 --> 00:11:32,140
I noticed he'd been acting
kinda weird recently.

224
00:11:32,223 --> 00:11:33,516
Now what?

225
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,851
What do you mean?

226
00:11:34,934 --> 00:11:37,562
Don't you wanna talk to
him about what's going on?

227
00:11:39,022 --> 00:11:40,815
It doesn't matter if I
wanna talk or not--

228
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:43,234
he refuses to meet up with me.

229
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:46,905
Besides. I trust him
to do what's best.

230
00:11:46,988 --> 00:11:49,616
He's been through a lot
of difficult things.

231
00:11:49,699 --> 00:11:52,577
But he is my little
brother, after all.

232
00:11:52,660 --> 00:11:54,496
So I know he'll be okay.

233
00:11:55,705 --> 00:11:59,000
If anyone goes global,
it'll be him.

234
00:11:59,084 --> 00:12:00,377
[gasps]

235
00:12:01,878 --> 00:12:03,046
Natsuya.

236
00:12:03,129 --> 00:12:04,464
Huh?

237
00:12:04,547 --> 00:12:07,842
Listen, that's a lovely
sentiment, but maybe it's time

238
00:12:07,926 --> 00:12:10,136
for you to approach
things more seriously.

239
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,390
Not just Ikuya,
but swimming, too.

240
00:12:22,816 --> 00:12:23,983
[knocking]

241
00:12:24,067 --> 00:12:25,235
[KAZUMA]
Comin' in.

242
00:12:26,611 --> 00:12:27,529
Look at you!

243
00:12:27,612 --> 00:12:29,447
Headin' out tomorrow?

244
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:30,824
That's right.

245
00:12:30,907 --> 00:12:32,158
Kinda brings back memories

246
00:12:32,242 --> 00:12:34,494
of when I did my
training in Tokyo.

247
00:12:34,577 --> 00:12:36,705
But I thought you said it was
your training in France

248
00:12:36,788 --> 00:12:38,707
that made you into
the chef you are today.

249
00:12:38,790 --> 00:12:40,625
Well, when I said that,
it was because I was

250
00:12:40,709 --> 00:12:42,293
trying to become a French chef.

251
00:12:42,377 --> 00:12:46,464
After that, I went to Mexico,
then India, then Tokyo.

252
00:12:46,548 --> 00:12:49,217
Your career's been kind of
a long road, I guess.

253
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:50,635
Maybe, but sometimes in life,

254
00:12:50,719 --> 00:12:55,432
you gotta take the long road.
That said, here's a tip.

255
00:12:55,515 --> 00:12:57,559
Once you've made your
choice, don't look back.

256
00:12:57,642 --> 00:12:59,394
All you really have to do
is believe in yourself

257
00:12:59,477 --> 00:13:01,354
and keep on moving forward.

258
00:13:01,438 --> 00:13:02,689
And don't you forget--

259
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:05,108
you'll always have me
to back you up, bro.

260
00:13:05,191 --> 00:13:06,234
I'll leave you be.

261
00:13:06,317 --> 00:13:07,861
Travel safe, okay?

262
00:13:07,944 --> 00:13:09,112
Sure.

263
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:13,533
Thanks, Kazuma.
That means a lot.

264
00:13:15,493 --> 00:13:17,787
From now on,

265
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:20,331
I'm done hesitating.

266
00:13:20,415 --> 00:13:23,043
Uh-- Come on, Makoto!

267
00:13:23,126 --> 00:13:24,252
I don't want us
to be late again,

268
00:13:24,336 --> 00:13:26,504
like at the newcomer tournament!

269
00:13:26,588 --> 00:13:30,383
Sorry, it took me a long
time to get ready!

270
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:32,719
We'll get to see Ikuya
swim today, right?

271
00:13:32,802 --> 00:13:33,887
Think so.

272
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:35,597
I hope you have a chance
to work things out

273
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,848
with him this time.

274
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,558
Everything'll be fine.

275
00:13:38,641 --> 00:13:42,145
We'll all be there.
Haru, Asahi, and us.

276
00:13:42,228 --> 00:13:43,688
Do you think there's
anything I can do

277
00:13:43,772 --> 00:13:45,398
to help you guys?

278
00:13:47,484 --> 00:13:49,694
Yeah, just be there for us.

279
00:13:51,154 --> 00:13:52,614
Well, let's hit the road!

280
00:13:52,697 --> 00:13:55,784
It's time to see our friends
in the college championships!

281
00:13:55,867 --> 00:13:57,285
Off we go!

282
00:13:58,828 --> 00:14:00,205
[TSUKAMOTO]
For you first-years,

283
00:14:00,288 --> 00:14:03,083
these'll be your
first major races.

284
00:14:03,166 --> 00:14:05,001
And for all of you,
this is your opportunity

285
00:14:05,085 --> 00:14:08,338
to enter the ranks for
the All-Japan Invitational.

286
00:14:08,421 --> 00:14:10,215
What I mean, of course,
is that today's times

287
00:14:10,298 --> 00:14:13,843
will decide if you qualify.
So keep your energy high...

288
00:14:15,011 --> 00:14:16,763
...and give it your best!

289
00:14:16,846 --> 00:14:18,139
[SWIM TEAM]
Sir!

290
00:14:28,274 --> 00:14:30,527
[ASAHI]
Whoa, check it out!

291
00:14:30,610 --> 00:14:32,320
This is it, huh?

292
00:14:32,404 --> 00:14:33,488
Yeah.

293
00:14:33,571 --> 00:14:35,073
[NATSUYA]
Gives you a rush, doesn't it?

294
00:14:35,156 --> 00:14:36,324
[HARUKA, ASAHI]
Huh?

295
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:38,576
Yo. Remember me?

296
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:42,706
[ASAHI] Uh-- Are you kidding me?
Natsuya's here, too?

297
00:14:42,789 --> 00:14:45,375
Not exactly the reaction
I was going for.

298
00:14:45,458 --> 00:14:47,877
You're right, sorry,
it's good to see you!

299
00:14:47,961 --> 00:14:49,254
[HARUKA]
Hope you're well.

300
00:14:49,337 --> 00:14:53,425
Hey, relax, I'm not your dad.
So, how's it going?

301
00:14:53,508 --> 00:14:55,552
--Not bad.
--[ASAHI] Can't complain.

302
00:14:57,387 --> 00:14:59,097
[HARUKA]
Except...

303
00:14:59,180 --> 00:15:02,392
Ikuya's been having
a hard time lately.

304
00:15:02,475 --> 00:15:04,477
I wanna try and do--

305
00:15:04,561 --> 00:15:08,565
Hey, it's okay. I don't
need you to explain.

306
00:15:08,648 --> 00:15:10,400
You just try to handle
things the best you can,

307
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:13,028
and don't worry about the rest.

308
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:17,198
[NATSUYA]
I'm rootin' for you. Good luck.

309
00:15:17,282 --> 00:15:18,408
[HARUKA, ASAHI]
Thank you!

310
00:15:20,285 --> 00:15:22,412

Find someone you like?

311
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:23,830
We'll see.

312
00:15:23,913 --> 00:15:26,499
For right now, most of my
attention's on these guys.

313
00:15:26,583 --> 00:15:28,126
Want some?

314
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,754
I like the Kanto udon flavor.

Good. We made it
in plenty of time.

00:15:34,591 --> 00:15:36,051
[KISUMI] They're a lot
louder than the crowd

318
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:37,844
at the newcomers' meet.

319
00:15:37,927 --> 00:15:39,262
[MAKOTO]
Yeah.

320
00:15:40,972 --> 00:15:42,849
[MAKOTO]
It's finally happening.

321
00:15:43,767 --> 00:15:44,976
Haru and the others have their

322
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:47,395
college championships
today, don't they?

323
00:15:47,479 --> 00:15:48,897
Yes they do, and if
they're able to beat

324
00:15:48,980 --> 00:15:51,232
the qualifying time,
it means they can advance

325
00:15:51,316 --> 00:15:52,525
to the All-Japan tournament!

326
00:15:52,609 --> 00:15:55,153
[GOU] Haruka can make
the cut, no problem!

327
00:15:55,236 --> 00:15:57,822
Is Rin not gonna come back
to Japan for this one?

328
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:00,116
I'm sure he'd like to,
but he's enrolled in a school

329
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:02,577
in Sydney now, so he's
not allowed to compete

330
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:04,788
in a Japanese championship.

331
00:16:04,871 --> 00:16:07,082
But for the
All-Japan Invitational...

332
00:16:07,165 --> 00:16:08,875
Oh, that's perfectly fine!

333
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,211
To make it, all he's gotta do
is beat the qualifying time

334
00:16:11,294 --> 00:16:15,256
at an Australian tournament.
And check this out!

335
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,675
Look what he just sent!

336
00:16:16,758 --> 00:16:18,510
He qualified in the
100-meter butterfly

337
00:16:18,593 --> 00:16:20,637
and 100-meter freestyle!

338
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,180
[NAGISA]
Cool!

339
00:16:22,263 --> 00:16:24,974
He's amazing! Tell him
we say congratulations!

340
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:27,602
[GOU giggles]
I will!

341
00:16:27,686 --> 00:16:30,313
If he's swimming freestyle,
he'll be with Haru!

342
00:16:30,397 --> 00:16:31,815
Right!

343
00:16:31,898 --> 00:16:34,025
And won't that race be an
impressive spectacle to behold?

344
00:16:34,109 --> 00:16:35,318
Our own Rin and Haruka,

345
00:16:35,402 --> 00:16:37,821
finally facing off
at the national level!

346
00:16:37,904 --> 00:16:39,447
[giggles] Awesome!

347

Look, there's Haruka.

349
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:47,789
It's the final for the
100-meter freestyle!

--Um, sorry, I'm excited.

362
00:17:34,127 --> 00:17:36,254
He had the lead by seven heads.

00:17:36,338 --> 00:17:39,090
Dang. I guess the
kid's name is Nanase.

364
00:17:39,174 --> 00:17:40,508
And "nana" means "seven."

365
00:17:40,592 --> 00:17:43,678
Yeah that's cool, but there's
much more to see here.

366
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:45,472
He really is unbelievable.

367
00:17:45,555 --> 00:17:47,891
We didn't come here
just to look impressed.

368
00:17:47,974 --> 00:17:50,435
The 50-meter free
final's up next.

That's Toono's race.

Thanks.

Uh...

It's you.

398
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:27,824
[ASAHI] I'm glad we finally
get to talk. How've you been?

399
00:19:27,907 --> 00:19:29,784
[IKUYA]
I'm okay, I guess.

400
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,830
There's so much
I wanted to tell you.

401
00:19:33,913 --> 00:19:37,542
By the way, I ran into your
brother back in the arena.

402
00:19:37,625 --> 00:19:38,793
Huh.

403
00:19:38,877 --> 00:19:41,796
It's been a while since
he and I saw each other.

404
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:44,049
I'm not too proud of the times
I've been posting lately,

405
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:46,176
so I didn't wanna
reach out to him.

406
00:19:46,259 --> 00:19:48,720
Ikuya, are you okay?

407
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:51,056
All three of us have been
really worried about you.

408
00:19:51,139 --> 00:19:52,807
We even went to your
college to try to find you

409
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:54,601
so we could all
talk things over.

410
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:56,394
But then, that four-eyed,
stuck-up jerk

411
00:19:56,478 --> 00:19:58,021
wouldn't stop
getting in the way.

412
00:19:58,104 --> 00:19:59,689
What's his problem?

413
00:19:59,773 --> 00:20:00,857
I dunno.

414
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:03,151
I don't think he's
all that bad of a guy.

415
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:05,195
Deep down, he really cares.

416
00:20:05,278 --> 00:20:06,905
I'm sorry. I guess
I shouldn't talk crap

417
00:20:06,988 --> 00:20:09,366
about your friend like that.

418
00:20:09,449 --> 00:20:11,785
[IKUYA] I don't know if
I'd say he's a "friend."

419
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:12,786
Huh?

420
00:20:12,869 --> 00:20:15,413
There's no way to tell anymore.

421
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:18,166
I hit a wall when
I was in the states.

422
00:20:18,249 --> 00:20:20,210
Once that happened,
I saw a weakness in myself

423
00:20:20,293 --> 00:20:22,796
that I didn't notice
when I swam on a team.

424
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:25,882
Ever since then, I haven't
depended on anyone else.

425
00:20:25,965 --> 00:20:27,801
Instead, I've been
completely focused on

426
00:20:27,884 --> 00:20:30,512
becoming stronger on my own.

427
00:20:30,595 --> 00:20:32,639
Having "friends" or "teammates."

428
00:20:32,722 --> 00:20:35,558
I don't know what
that means anymore.

429
00:20:35,642 --> 00:20:37,060
I'm sorry.

430
00:20:37,143 --> 00:20:38,561
Back when we were
in middle school,

431
00:20:38,645 --> 00:20:41,564
my dad ended up having to take
a transfer out of nowhere.

432
00:20:41,648 --> 00:20:44,150
So, during spring break,
while you were in America,

433
00:20:44,234 --> 00:20:46,444
my family suddenly
had to move away.

434
00:20:46,528 --> 00:20:48,697
I never got the
chance to apologize.

435
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:51,449
It's all right.
I understand that.

436
00:20:51,533 --> 00:20:52,617
But still, no matter what,

437
00:20:52,701 --> 00:20:54,077
I'll always think
of you as a friend.

438
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:56,621
You do know that, right?

439
00:20:56,705 --> 00:21:00,542
The four of us had a real bond.

440
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:04,045
And I know Haru and Makoto
feel the same way.

441
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:05,171
So...

442
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,673
Thanks for that.

443
00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:11,428
[IKUYA] I'm glad we got to talk,
too. But I should go.

444
00:21:11,511 --> 00:21:12,470
[ASAHI]
Huh?

445
00:21:12,554 --> 00:21:14,139
[IKUYA]
In the water, I'm alone.

446
00:21:14,222 --> 00:21:17,559
No one's gonna save me.
That won't change.

447
00:21:20,937 --> 00:21:22,522
Ikuya...

448
00:21:22,605 --> 00:21:25,233
[IKUYA]
I need to build more strength.

449
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:29,070
Otherwise, I won't
be me anymore.

450
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,906
[IKUYA]
I have to reach the point where

451
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:35,035
I'm not relying on anybody else.

452
00:21:35,118 --> 00:21:38,496
Stronger. Stronger.

453
00:21:38,580 --> 00:21:42,625
Right now, there's no
other solution for me.

454
00:21:44,669 --> 00:21:48,381
[gasps] Haru? Why--?

455
00:21:48,465 --> 00:21:52,385
[HARUKA] This was the only
way I could swim with you.

456
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:55,305
Stop thinking you can
go through life alone.

457
00:21:55,388 --> 00:21:57,223
Because you're not alone.
