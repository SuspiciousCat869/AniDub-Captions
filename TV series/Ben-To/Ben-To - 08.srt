No running in the halls.

00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,250
[SHAGA] Uh-oh.
Sorry 'bout that.

4
00:00:20,333 --> 00:00:22,000
[ASEBI] Yeah,
we won't do it again.

5
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:23,916
[SAWAGI PRES] Yes,
well, I certainly hope not.

00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,250
[SAWAGI VP] Let's go.

00:00:25,333 --> 00:00:26,750
Whoa,
she got really mad.

8
00:00:26,833 --> 00:00:28,541
Man, we were
just running in the halls,

00:00:28,625 --> 00:00:29,541

Slow down, Asebi!

00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:38,875
If you snooze, you lose!
This is gonna hurt really bad!

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:42,583
[SAWAGI PRES] As stewards of
Marutomi University High School,

14
00:00:42,666 --> 00:00:44,375
it is our duty to
exchange students

15
00:00:44,458 --> 00:00:46,291
with other schools
from time to time.

16
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,250
This task falls directly on
the shoulders of the

17
00:00:48,333 --> 00:00:51,125
student council and you,
its distinguished members.

18
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,750
It's almost like we're--

19
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:55,958
It's like we're diplomats.

20
00:00:56,041 --> 00:00:58,125
And as such,
we'll all have to behave

21
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,958
in a way that does
our school proud.

22
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:02,458
Yes, indeed.
That's very true, in fact,

23
00:01:02,541 --> 00:01:04,541
you took the words
right out of my mouth.

24
00:01:04,625 --> 00:01:06,708
[SAWAGI VP] With that in mind,
there're many things to discuss.

25
00:01:06,791 --> 00:01:08,833
Direct your attention
to the handout.

26
00:01:08,916 --> 00:01:10,458
The floor is yours, President.

27
00:01:10,541 --> 00:01:12,791
Oh, why, thank you,

You're in luck, 'cause
I made some incredibly

32
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,833

00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:56,041
[SATO] Oh, thank yo--

taste amazingly good?

cold glass of milk, huh?

Come on, you silly
goosey you, drink up already!

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,541
Hey, Sato.
This game kinda sucks.

39
00:03:07,625 --> 00:03:09,750
I can't reach her
with my punches.

40
00:03:09,833 --> 00:03:11,125
[SATO] That's 'cause
she's a genius at it

41
00:03:11,208 --> 00:03:13,166
and it's pretty much
impossible to beat her.

42
00:03:13,833 --> 00:03:15,083
[SHAGA] Oh, heck yeah!

43
00:03:15,583 --> 00:03:17,125
I'm so awesome at this game!

44
00:03:17,208 --> 00:03:18,625
I bet I could beat
you blind-folded;

45
00:03:18,708 --> 00:03:19,750

46

Come on.

00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:22,833
[YARIZUI] Mm hm.

49
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,791
Aw yeah!

00:03:28,916 --> 00:03:30,750
I won!
I'm the winner!

51
00:03:30,833 --> 00:03:33,416
[SATO] Wow, that's surprising;
Asebi's not half bad.

52
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:34,208
[SHAGA] That's 'cause
she used to work

53
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:35,666
part time in a game store.

54
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,125
She stunk at first,
but after playing

with the customers every day,

got really good at it.

[YARIZUI] So.

00:03:52,416 --> 00:03:53,833
I'm curious...
How much does the game

64
00:03:53,916 --> 00:03:55,583
and console cost altogether?

65
00:03:55,666 --> 00:03:56,833
[SATO] Oh.
Well.

66
00:03:56,916 --> 00:03:58,916
I'm not sure, but I
know it's pretty cheap

67
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,625
if you buy it second hand.

Why, what's up?

the truest freedom
there is, but I disagree.

00:07:29,833 --> 00:07:31,375
So who was that
young man who

160
00:07:31,458 --> 00:07:33,500
dropped by to visit you earlier?
Your boyfriend?

161
00:07:33,583 --> 00:07:36,000
Gross. No way,
he's just a friend.

162
00:07:36,083 --> 00:07:37,125
[SAWAGI PRES]
Don't be so careless,

163
00:07:37,208 --> 00:07:38,625
are you trying to get us busted?

164
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:39,875
[SAWAGI VP] I think
we should go head

165
00:07:39,958 --> 00:07:41,875
and find a hideout
somewhere just to be safe.

166
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:42,916
[SAWAGI PRES] Good call.

167
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,250
Hey, I think I hear
someone coming.

168
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:51,375
Look.
He's waking up.

169
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,791
[SATO] You guys.
Where am I?

170
00:07:53,875 --> 00:07:54,791
[YARIZUI] The hospital.

171
00:07:54,875 --> 00:07:56,000
[SATO] Hospital?

172
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,791
[SHAGA] Yeah.
The Inoue General Hospital.

173
00:07:57,875 --> 00:07:59,875
It's operated by Asebi's family.

174
00:07:59,958 --> 00:08:02,541
You're pretty
lucky you're not dead.

175
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,625
They said its
better if you stay in

176
00:08:04,708 --> 00:08:07,166
your bed for a little while.
Lie down and rest.

177
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,833
Your whole body's
completely covered

178
00:08:08,916 --> 00:08:10,666
in bandages;
you look like a mummy.

179
00:08:10,750 --> 00:08:13,333
[SHAGA] I'm just really
glad you're still alive.

180
00:08:13,791 --> 00:08:16,458
You fell really far!
Whoosh!

181
00:08:16,541 --> 00:08:18,250
Seeing you like this
has given me an idea

182
00:08:18,333 --> 00:08:20,416
for a role-play that
I think you'll enjoy.

183
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:22,250
[SATO] A role play?

184
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,250
"Please don't force
yourself on me when I'm all

185
00:08:24,333 --> 00:08:26,958
tied up like this, Shaga!"
Don't look so surprised!

186
00:08:27,041 --> 00:08:28,208
You've got porn mags
in your room with

187
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,750
stuff much worse than that!

188
00:08:29,833 --> 00:08:31,125
I'm no expert,
but don't you have

189
00:08:31,208 --> 00:08:32,916
to be eighteen to
buy dirty magazines?

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,791
Oho, he's got his ways!

191
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,958
I bet an innocent, young girl
like the Ice Witch here

192
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,333
would be shocked
if she saw the smut

193
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,208
you've got in your room, Sato.

194
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,791
Or should I say Pervert--

195
00:08:41,875 --> 00:08:43,791
Visiting hours
are over, ladies!

196
00:08:43,875 --> 00:08:45,083
Time to go home!

197
00:08:45,166 --> 00:08:46,833
[SHAGA] 'Kay.

198
00:08:48,291 --> 00:08:50,291
[NURSE 8A] Kids these days.

199
00:08:55,333 --> 00:08:56,916
[SHAGA] Looks like it's
about time for Macchan

200
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,500
to do her job, Ice Witch.

201
00:08:58,583 --> 00:08:59,291
[YARIZUI] Right.

202
00:08:59,375 --> 00:09:00,375
The Ice Witch!

203
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:01,875
[ASEBI] We'll come
see ya tomorrow!

204
00:09:01,958 --> 00:09:03,625
[SHAGA] Later, Pervert!

205
00:09:03,708 --> 00:09:07,041
--The Beauty by the Lake!
--Oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

206
00:09:07,125 --> 00:09:08,916
[SAWAGI PRES]
I'm just a regular nurse!

207
00:09:12,541 --> 00:09:13,291
Hey, hold on.

208
00:09:13,375 --> 00:09:14,458
Why, what's
the matter?

209
00:09:14,541 --> 00:09:16,250
[SHAGA] I feel like I know her.

210
00:09:16,333 --> 00:09:19,000
Huh. Maybe it's
my imagination.

211
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,250
Hey, Sato.
No, please, don't get up.

212
00:09:40,166 --> 00:09:41,875
[SATO] What's up?

213
00:09:45,625 --> 00:09:47,708
Oshiroi found some
inspiration for her novel,

214
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:49,166
so she left early.

215
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,333
She wanted to write it
down before she lost it.

216
00:09:58,041 --> 00:10:00,041
I'm really sorry, Sato.

217
00:10:00,708 --> 00:10:02,250
I feel horrible.

218
00:10:02,333 --> 00:10:05,458
I didn't realize how
important that thing is to you.

219
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:09,583
Now that I know, I regret
throwing it out the window.

220
00:10:09,666 --> 00:10:11,458
[YARIZUI] I want
to make it up to you.

221
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,708
[SATO THINKS] I can think of a
couple of things you can do!

222
00:10:13,791 --> 00:10:16,166
I'll let you have
half of my next bento.

223
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,125
[Sato groans]

224
00:10:18,208 --> 00:10:19,750
[YARIZUI] See ya.

225
00:10:21,416 --> 00:10:22,708
[SAWAGI PRES]
I found the Ice Witch!

226
00:10:22,791 --> 00:10:24,041
She's in three-oh-two!

227
00:10:24,125 --> 00:10:25,791
[NURSE 8C] The patient
in room two-oh-six told me

228
00:10:25,875 --> 00:10:27,833
he's suffering from some
pretty bad headaches.

229
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:29,416
[NURSE 8D] In that case,
it's probably best

230
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,291
to tell a doctor immediately.

231
00:10:38,708 --> 00:10:41,208
I have excellent news!

232
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:49,916
[SHIRAUME] Ben-To.

233
00:10:50,500 --> 00:10:51,833
[Oshiroi moans]

234
00:10:51,916 --> 00:10:54,666
[OSHIROI] It's wrong.
All wrong.

235
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,916
Well, I suppose
I should get going, huh?

236
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,875
[SAWAGI VP] Not just yet.

237
00:11:00,958 --> 00:11:01,916
What's wrong?

238
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,208
I've made it too
far to tuck my tail

239
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,333
between my legs and give up!

240
00:11:04,416 --> 00:11:06,083
The Ice Witch is
so close I can literally

241
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:07,333
reach out and touch her.

242
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:09,083
Stopping now would be
like asking me to take

243
00:11:09,166 --> 00:11:11,208
six steps back and half
a dozen the other way!

244
00:11:11,291 --> 00:11:13,250
[SAWAGI VP] Yes, I know;
but I also know the idiom

245
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:14,833
you just tried to
use there makes

246
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,291
absolutely no sense whatsoever.

247
00:11:17,375 --> 00:11:18,791
And aren't you
forgetting something?

248
00:11:18,875 --> 00:11:21,000
Oh, that's right.

249
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,375
I took it upon
myself to handle it.

250
00:11:24,666 --> 00:11:26,000
None of this
even matters.

251
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:28,166
Can't you see it's
entirely meaningless?

252
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,083
Why continue on like this?

253
00:11:30,166 --> 00:11:32,000
Because I want
to meet her for myself!

254
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:34,083
I want to meet the Ice Witch!

255
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:37,500
My heart is about to explode,
and I just can't take it!

256
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:38,833
Oh, Sis.

257
00:11:38,916 --> 00:11:40,250
[SAWAGI PRES]
Don't you worry, Kyo.

258
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,208
I'll come back safe and sound,
just you wait and see!

259
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:50,208
[SAWAGI VP THINKS] That
night was just like this one.

260
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:54,500
Why did you come
here again, Sis?

261
00:11:54,583 --> 00:11:55,666
Well?

262
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,041
[SAWAGI PRES]
That girl. Who is she?

263
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,708
[SAWAGI VP] The Ice Witch.

264
00:12:07,125 --> 00:12:08,416
She's an infamous
wolf who

265
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:10,083
has laid claim to
this territory.

266
00:12:10,166 --> 00:12:12,583
Hold on, how do
you know so much about her?

267
00:12:12,666 --> 00:12:15,916
Because like you,
I find myself intrigued by her.

268
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,250
[SAWAGI VP] Rumor has it,
she's the one who

269
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:20,166
took out the
Monarch the other day.

270
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:22,916
[SAWAGI PRES] Seriously?
He used to rule this area!

271
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,750
[SAWAGI VP] She heads up
the strongest club in the west.

272
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:27,875
The Karasuda High School
Half-Price Food Lover's Club.

273
00:12:27,958 --> 00:12:31,375
In a town of tough competitors,
they're known as the toughest.

274
00:12:31,458 --> 00:12:33,583
[SAWAGI PRES] She must
be something special then.

275
00:12:33,666 --> 00:12:37,416
I'd give anything to see her do
battle up close and in person.

276
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:44,916
Sis, give me
a status update.

277
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,166
How's it going so far?

278
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:48,791
Fine. Everything's
in perfect order.

279
00:12:55,916 --> 00:12:58,208
[SAWAGI PRES] It's her.
The Ice Witch.

280
00:12:59,083 --> 00:13:02,208
Sorry! I really
didn't mean to--

281
00:13:02,916 --> 00:13:04,625
I'm just here to
take your temperature.

282
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:06,583
We want to make sure
we do everything possible

283
00:13:06,666 --> 00:13:08,833
to give you a speedy recovery.

284
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:15,041
[SAWAGI PRES] I can
take it out in just a second.

285
00:13:15,125 --> 00:13:17,416
[SATO THINKS] I think
I'd rather put it in!

286
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:20,583
I want to get to know you
as intimately as I possibly can.

287
00:13:20,666 --> 00:13:22,208
[beeping]

288
00:13:22,291 --> 00:13:23,791
[SAWAGI VP]
Ninety-eight-point-four degrees.

289
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,958
That's a little higher
than it should be.

290
00:13:26,041 --> 00:13:28,208
How can you be smart
enough to plan all this out,

291
00:13:28,291 --> 00:13:31,916
and yet still be so completely
clueless about everything else?

292
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,416
[SAWAGI PRES]
I want to know all about you.

293
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:35,500
Tell me your deepest secrets!

294
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,958
My little heart's
beating so fast.

295
00:13:38,041 --> 00:13:39,500
It's like--

296
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,041
[SAWAGI VP] Like first love.

297
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,708
Isn't that an apt
way to describe it?

298
00:13:44,791 --> 00:13:45,916
[SAWAGI PRES] Yes!

299
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,250
It's like an innocent
and pure first love!

300
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,000
[SAWAGI PRES] Okay,
you can lie back now.

301
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,833
[SATO] What is this?

302
00:13:58,375 --> 00:13:59,333
[SAWAGI PRES] Look at that.

303
00:13:59,416 --> 00:14:01,250
When I put my
feet next to yours--

304
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:02,250
Your head's all the way up

305
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,208
there and
mine's down here.

306
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:07,125
Wow. My goodness,
you're really tall.

307
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,458
Well? What should
we do now?

308
00:14:11,541 --> 00:14:12,916
[SAWAGI VP] Sh.

309
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,708
The staff will find us if
you keep yelling like that.

310
00:14:14,791 --> 00:14:17,333
It was a total disaster;
I ruined everything!

311
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,000
Her pulse went nuts and
she started hyperventilating.

312
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,208
There's no doubt about it,
Kyo, the Ice Witch

313
00:14:22,291 --> 00:14:23,375
hates me now for sure.

314
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,250
You can't exactly
blame her; anyone would

315
00:14:25,333 --> 00:14:27,791
get a little weirded out if a
stranger climbed into her bed.

316
00:14:27,875 --> 00:14:30,375
Oh.
You think?

317
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:33,166
Well, I didn't have a choice!
I'm drawn to her.

318
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,666
And I want to know everything
about her there is to know!

319
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:38,166
No matter what might happen!

320
00:14:44,333 --> 00:14:45,958
[SATO] Why is she measuring me?

321
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,541
[SAWAGI VP] I need
you to try to stay still.

322
00:14:47,625 --> 00:14:48,916
[SATO] That's weird.

323
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,125
Not sure what, but something
about her is different.

324
00:14:51,208 --> 00:14:52,916
I need to measure
your other arm.

325
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:56,083
[Sato going crazy]

326
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,041
[SAWAGI VP] Okay, I'm all done.

327
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,750
[SAWAGI PRES] You work fast.

328
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:02,083
[SAWAGI VP] We good?

329
00:15:02,166 --> 00:15:04,083
We definitely got all
the information we needed.

330
00:15:04,166 --> 00:15:06,375
For a girl, she has
really long arms.

331
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:08,541
I would imagine her reach
comes in pretty handy

332
00:15:08,625 --> 00:15:10,291
in the middle of a brawl.

333
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:13,208
[SAWAGI PRES] I wish you
could show me how you move.

334
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:16,375
There's nothing I'd love more
than to see you in action.

335
00:15:16,791 --> 00:15:17,875
[SAWAGI PRES] I wanna
see what you can do

336
00:15:17,958 --> 00:15:19,416
with those long limbs of yours.

337
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:20,291
[Sato cries out]

338
00:15:20,375 --> 00:15:22,083
What gives?
Are you okay?

339
00:15:22,166 --> 00:15:23,625
Oh no, please don't tell me.

340
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,500
[SAWAGI PRES] You don't
think I'm worthy of your time!

341
00:15:25,583 --> 00:15:27,416
Go ahead, you can
be honest with me.

342
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:30,500
Just admit that you think a
round with me would be like--

343
00:15:33,041 --> 00:15:35,791
[SAWAGI VP] Like taking
candy from a baby, perhaps?

344
00:15:35,875 --> 00:15:37,375
[SAWAGI PRES] Yes!
That's the one!

345
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:40,500
A round with me would be like
giving candy to a little baby!

346
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,083
Oh, boy.
It's taking, not giving;

347
00:15:43,166 --> 00:15:45,500
how does giving candy to
a baby make sense?

348
00:15:45,875 --> 00:15:47,333
[SAWAGI VP] Of all the
people I've ever met,

349
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:50,083
you're absolutely the worst
at constructing similes.

350
00:15:50,166 --> 00:15:52,541
Seriously, you have got to stop;
it is super embarrassing.

351
00:15:52,625 --> 00:15:53,875
So what? All I want is

352
00:15:53,958 --> 00:15:55,708
to witness the
heroism of the Ice Witch!

353
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,333
I wanna learn her magical ways,

354
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,416
and know all her deepest,
darkest secrets.

355
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,958
Can you explain
how you being a weirdo

356
00:16:01,041 --> 00:16:02,583
stalker has anything to do with

357
00:16:02,666 --> 00:16:04,833
the fact that you're
simile-challenged?

358
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,083
I'm disappointed.

359
00:16:07,166 --> 00:16:09,416
Why weren't you able to
dodge such a weak attack?

360
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:12,375
[SATO THINKS] Sometimes sweet,
and sometimes sour.

361
00:16:12,458 --> 00:16:14,666
The capricious
nature of a woman.

362
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:16,625
[SAWAGI VP] She's kind of
muscular, but aside from that,

363
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:18,041
I really don't
see anything that's

364
00:16:18,125 --> 00:16:19,750
particularly unusual about her.

365
00:16:19,833 --> 00:16:20,958
[SAWAGI PRES] Maybe
there's something at play

366
00:16:21,041 --> 00:16:23,458
that we haven't
thought about yet.

367
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:24,500
[SAWAGI PRES] That girl.

368
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:25,750
[SHAGA] Hey!
How ya feelin', sport?

369
00:16:25,833 --> 00:16:26,666
[SAWAGI PRES]
She's a freshman at

370
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,500
Marutomi University High School.

371
00:16:28,583 --> 00:16:30,458
Her name's Ayame Shaga.

372
00:16:30,541 --> 00:16:32,500
[SAWAGI VP] Most people
know her by her nom de guerre,

373
00:16:32,583 --> 00:16:34,291
the Beauty by the Lake.

374
00:16:39,416 --> 00:16:41,416
I have zero good ideas.

375
00:16:41,791 --> 00:16:43,125
I'm thinking about
going for a Hamburg

376
00:16:43,208 --> 00:16:45,125
steak loaded with
garlic chives bento.

377
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,083
Just wait until you see
the size of the patty,

378
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,958
and there's a
crap-ton of rice, too!

379
00:16:49,041 --> 00:16:51,125
Not to mention the
omelet they put on the side!

380
00:16:51,208 --> 00:16:52,833
And the steak comes
on a bed of whole

381
00:16:52,916 --> 00:16:54,541
and chopped cabbage leaves!

382
00:16:54,625 --> 00:16:56,458
Looks great, doesn't it?

383
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,583
And, when I finally
swallow down the last bite,

384
00:16:58,666 --> 00:17:00,416
I promise I'll
be thinking of you.

385
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,208
Bye bye, now!

386
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,666
[SAWAGI PRES] This is
unbelievable, why would the

387
00:17:07,750 --> 00:17:09,875
Ice Witch endure
such humiliation?

388
00:17:09,958 --> 00:17:11,625
[SAWAGI VP] You need to
keep it down out there, Sis.

389
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,416
You're gonna blow our cover.

390
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,291
After everything she said,

391
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:18,041
how could you
sit there and take it?

392
00:17:18,125 --> 00:17:20,125
I'm so sad.
I could cry!

393
00:17:20,208 --> 00:17:21,708
Because to me you're like.

394
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:24,375
[Sato shouts with excitement]

395
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,583
[SHAGA] I told him about
the Hamburg steak.

396
00:17:30,666 --> 00:17:32,416
And he seemed pretty jealous.

397
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:35,291
I just wish I could've
seen the look on his face.

398
00:17:35,375 --> 00:17:37,666
How long will it take
him to recover from that fall?

399
00:17:37,750 --> 00:17:39,416
I bet he'll be
back out tomorrow.

400
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,333
Yeah, but what about
all those bandages?

401
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,666
Oh please, those
are just for show.

402
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,833
[SHAGA] Asebi's family runs that
hospital so I called in a favor.

403
00:17:46,916 --> 00:17:48,375
I asked them to wrap
him up like a mummy

404
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,416
'cause I thought
it'd be hilarious.

405
00:17:50,791 --> 00:17:52,791
[SHAGA] And I was so right.

406
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:58,416
[SATO THINKS] There's a
hot nurse on top of me,

407
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:00,083
and I dunno what I should do!

408
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,583
[door opens]

409
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:05,583
Uh, hi, I'm a nurse.

410
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,791
Okay Sis, you're blowing
your own cover

411
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:10,541
by completely
freaking out right now.

412
00:18:10,625 --> 00:18:13,125
If I were you,
I'd get outta there ASAP!

413
00:18:14,875 --> 00:18:16,416
[SATO THINKS] What's up
with all the tension?

414
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,625
Oh, no way!

415
00:18:17,708 --> 00:18:20,000
Those two nurses are
about to fight over me!

416
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,000
[SATO THINKS] If I had a choice,

417
00:18:23,083 --> 00:18:24,958
I'd definitely want the
hot one to win!

418
00:18:25,041 --> 00:18:26,708
Roger that, I'm going
to make like a tree

419
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,750
and high tail it out of
here right now.

420
00:18:28,833 --> 00:18:30,125
Excuse me, there are many

421
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:32,125
pressing matters that
require my attention.

422
00:18:32,208 --> 00:18:34,000
[SATO THINKS] Crap!
The hottie's leaving.

423
00:18:34,083 --> 00:18:36,250
[NURSE 8A] Stop right there.

424
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,000
[SAWAGI PRES]
What can I do for you?

425
00:18:38,083 --> 00:18:39,291
It's your cap.

426
00:18:40,250 --> 00:18:42,041
From now on,
make sure it's on straight.

427
00:18:42,125 --> 00:18:44,416
[SAWAGI PRES] Right.
Thank you very much, ma'am.

428
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:45,583
[NURSE 8A] Hold on!

429
00:18:45,666 --> 00:18:46,875
What's the matter?

430
00:18:46,958 --> 00:18:48,791
Your collar
is all wrong, too.

431
00:18:49,125 --> 00:18:50,958
[SAWAGI PRES] I'm sorry.
Okay then.

432
00:18:51,041 --> 00:18:51,958
[NURSE 8A] One more thing.

433
00:18:52,041 --> 00:18:53,958
Oh for the love--what
is it now?

434
00:18:54,041 --> 00:18:55,541
[NURSE 8A] Take these.

435
00:18:55,625 --> 00:18:58,125
You're the rookie who started
training here today, aren't you?

436
00:18:58,208 --> 00:19:00,458
Stop slacking and do your job!

437
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:06,375
[SATO THINKS] No more Grandma.

438
00:19:06,458 --> 00:19:07,500
[SAWAGI VP]
Get outta there, Sis!

439
00:19:07,583 --> 00:19:09,166
Run while you still can!

440
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,166
No way. This is
the perfect opportunity

441
00:19:11,250 --> 00:19:13,666
for me to get some one-on-one
time with the Ice Witch!

442
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:15,208
[SAWAGI VP] What?

443
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,708
[MOTHER 4] So, what did they
have you cook in home ec. today?

444
00:19:16,791 --> 00:19:17,875
[YOUNG GIRL 4A]
Fish paste rolls!

445
00:19:17,958 --> 00:19:19,500
Want some?
They're delicious!

446
00:19:19,583 --> 00:19:20,708
[MOTHER 4A] Yeah, I can't wait.

447
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,916
[OSHIROI] Maybe
I should go visit Sato.

448
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,708
Come on! Let's get
those clothes off

449
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,750
so I can see everything!

450
00:19:28,291 --> 00:19:30,125
When I first laid
eyes on you, I swear,

451
00:19:30,208 --> 00:19:31,750
it was as if I could
see the fiery passion

452
00:19:31,833 --> 00:19:33,416
burning deep down inside of you.

453
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:35,125
I will never forget
that moment.

454
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,750
How exciting
and touching it was!

455
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:40,458
I can't take it!
It's too much!

456
00:19:40,541 --> 00:19:42,625
I can't control myself anymore!

457
00:19:42,708 --> 00:19:45,875
Whoa. It's so muscular;
like a boy's leg.

458
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,208
[SATO] Uh, thank you?

459
00:19:47,291 --> 00:19:48,541
Oh wow,

460
00:19:48,625 --> 00:19:49,833
and your voice is a
lot deeper than I expected.

461
00:19:49,916 --> 00:19:51,625
Yeah, it dropped
after puberty.

462
00:19:51,708 --> 00:19:53,333
What do we have here--

463
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:56,125
[SAWAGI VP] Oh my.

464
00:19:56,208 --> 00:20:00,250
Oh wow, no way.
You're-- you're a--

465
00:20:00,333 --> 00:20:03,500
Pervert!
Pervert! Pervert!

466
00:20:03,583 --> 00:20:04,625
[SATO] Wait!

467
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,458
He's a big pervert!

468
00:20:06,541 --> 00:20:10,208
[SATO] Wait a sec!
No! Please!

469
00:20:10,291 --> 00:20:11,458
You've got the wrong idea!

470
00:20:11,541 --> 00:20:12,750
[SAWAGI PRES] Somebody
please come and help me!

471
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:14,666
[SATO] Come back!
I can explain everything!

472
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:16,208
[SAWAGI PRES]
I'm being chased by a pervert!

473
00:20:16,291 --> 00:20:19,666
[SATO] I'm not a pervert!
I swear to you, I'm not!

474
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:23,791
[NURSE 8A]
What's this commotion?

475
00:20:23,875 --> 00:20:26,083
[NURSE 8E] We've got a
pervert on our hands, ma'am!

476
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:30,125
[ASEBI] Hey, guess what?

477
00:20:30,208 --> 00:20:32,125
You're sick,
so I brought you hot milk!

478
00:20:32,208 --> 00:20:33,333
Looky-looky-loo!

479
00:20:33,416 --> 00:20:35,541
[SATO] No. No. No.
Oh no!

480
00:20:37,166 --> 00:20:40,458
[SATO] Okay, that hurt!
I feel like I'm burning alive!

481
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,291
This sucks!

482
00:20:41,375 --> 00:20:44,041
[OSHIROI] Sato?
Holy cow.

483
00:20:44,416 --> 00:20:48,000
This is fappable.
Yes! Momma likey.

484
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,125
[SATO]
'Momma likey' what?

485
00:20:49,208 --> 00:20:50,750
[NURSE 8A] There's the pervert!

486
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:56,583
I did not see
that one coming.

487
00:20:56,666 --> 00:20:57,875
I mean, who would've
ever thought the

488
00:20:57,958 --> 00:21:00,083
Ice Witch is actually a boy!

489
00:21:00,166 --> 00:21:02,375
No. That wasn't the
Ice Witch, it was Yo Sato,

490
00:21:02,458 --> 00:21:05,125
aka 'The Pervert,' one of
her minions from the club.

491
00:21:05,208 --> 00:21:07,250
The Pervert?

492
00:21:07,333 --> 00:21:08,833
This is dumb!

493
00:21:08,916 --> 00:21:10,625
Why'd we even
dress up like this?

494
00:21:10,708 --> 00:21:12,333
[SAWAGI VP] Hate to
say it, but I told you so.

495
00:21:12,416 --> 00:21:15,250
I even tried to warn you, but
you wouldn't listen to me.

496
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:16,791
You know, in a way,
I feel like this

497
00:21:16,875 --> 00:21:19,208
experience has
given me some peace.

498
00:21:22,250 --> 00:21:23,375
[SAWAGI PRES]
Truth be told, it's been

499
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,708
three years since my
heart raced like this!

500
00:21:29,750 --> 00:21:31,416
I finally found it.

501
00:21:32,833 --> 00:21:36,333
Oh, hey. What are
those two doing here?

502
00:21:36,958 --> 00:21:38,625
[SHAGA] Bento boxes.

503
00:21:40,291 --> 00:21:43,333
[SHAGA] Whoa!
What happened?

504
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,291
[closing song]

505
00:21:57,916 --> 00:21:59,916
[girl singing in Japanese]

506
00:23:16,708 --> 00:23:19,000
[SAWAGI PRES] Open up and say.
'Ah'!

507
00:23:19,083 --> 00:23:23,666
Are you serious?
Why do I have to do tha--?

508
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:25,375
Uh-oh, Kyo.

509
00:23:25,458 --> 00:23:27,750
You've got a little
something on your face.

510
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:30,791
So did I get it?

511
00:23:30,875 --> 00:23:31,666
[SAWAGI PRES] Yeah.

512
00:23:33,875 --> 00:23:34,583
Oh hey, Sis.

513
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:35,833
Don't worry it's fine.

514
00:23:35,916 --> 00:23:38,250
I already memorized the
entire preview dialogue.

515
00:23:38,333 --> 00:23:39,666
I know it like--

516
00:23:40,125 --> 00:23:41,416
I think 'like the
back of your hand'

517
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,500
is the phrase
you're looking for.

518
00:23:42,583 --> 00:23:44,041
Yes!
I think that's the one!

519
00:23:44,125 --> 00:23:45,416
And yet,
you still haven't said

520
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:46,666
a single one of
your lines, have you?
