1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,166
[SHAGA] Check it out!
Allow me to blow your minds.

2
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:11,458
Ta-da!

3
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:13,500
[SATO] What're those?

4
00:00:13,583 --> 00:00:15,208
[SHAGA] I was talking with
Matsuba at Ralph Store

5
00:00:15,291 --> 00:00:17,416
yesterday and
she gave them to me.

6
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,291
She told me to share
them with you guys.

7
00:00:21,208 --> 00:00:23,625
[SATO] They're free tickets
to the Super Hawaiian Park.

8
00:00:23,708 --> 00:00:24,958
What's that?

9
00:00:25,041 --> 00:00:26,958
[YARIZUI] A water park.
And everything's indoors.

10
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:30,208
It's run by the same company
that owns the Ralph Store chain.

11
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:33,291
[SATO THINKS] A water park?
That means swimsuits!

12
00:00:33,375 --> 00:00:36,500
[YARIZUI] You okay?
What's the deal?

13
00:00:36,583 --> 00:00:38,625
[SATO] We have to do this!

14
00:00:39,916 --> 00:00:41,750
[YARIZUI] Sure,
it sounds pretty fun.

15
00:00:41,833 --> 00:00:43,333
[SATO] Great!
Thank you!

16
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:46,041
[SATO THINKS] Summer just
began, and I already get

17
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:48,333
to see Yarizui
in a bathing suit.

18
00:00:48,416 --> 00:00:54,083
I am the happiest man
on the face of the earth!

19
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:59,458
[opening song]

20
00:01:16,083 --> 00:01:18,041
[girl singing in Japanese]

21
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,916
[SATO] Geez.

22
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,750
I didn't realize we'd have
to travel so far to get there.

23
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:32,875
[SHAGA] It's just
a two hour train ride,

24
00:02:32,958 --> 00:02:34,375
and it'll totally be worth it.

25
00:02:34,458 --> 00:02:35,791
I brought some snacks

26
00:02:35,875 --> 00:02:37,208
if you're starting
to get hungry.

27
00:02:37,291 --> 00:02:39,333
[SATO] Thanks,
but that's not the problem.

28
00:02:39,416 --> 00:02:41,500
It's just train tickets
are freakin' expensive.

29
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:42,583
[SHAGA] Why're you so cheap?

30
00:02:42,666 --> 00:02:44,041
[SATO] It's not like I wanna be!

31
00:02:44,125 --> 00:02:45,625
I've barely got enough
to get by each month.

32
00:02:45,708 --> 00:02:47,708
[SHAGA] A cheap
excuse for a cheap guy.

33
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,041
Yeah, sorry I couldn't
afford to buy you train

34
00:02:50,125 --> 00:02:51,583
tickets on top
of the free passes

35
00:02:51,666 --> 00:02:52,583
I gave you to the water park.

36
00:02:52,666 --> 00:02:54,541
[SATO] No,
that's not what I meant!

37
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:58,000
Just think about all the
fun you're going to have today!

38
00:02:58,083 --> 00:02:59,375
The place is huge so
I'm sure you'll have

39
00:02:59,458 --> 00:03:01,500
your hands full
exploring it all.

40
00:03:01,583 --> 00:03:04,583
[SATO THINKS]
I'll have my hands full?

41
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,666
They're definitely
a hand full. Oh yeah.

42
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:11,500
Hey, cut it out!
Yarizui is more than enough!

43
00:03:11,583 --> 00:03:13,916
[SATO THINKS] I wonder what
kind of swimsuit she wears.

44
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,791
A bikini?
One piece?

45
00:03:15,875 --> 00:03:17,333
Maybe a school swimsuit?

46
00:03:17,416 --> 00:03:19,916
Whatever, the cut
doesn't really matter.

47
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
She's gonna be clad
in a single, skimpy,

48
00:03:22,083 --> 00:03:23,791
thin layer and that's priceless.

49
00:03:23,875 --> 00:03:25,125
That's more than enough to make

50
00:03:25,208 --> 00:03:27,125
up for the cost
of the train ride.

51
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,208
Yes.

52
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,708
I would spend all
the money I have

53
00:03:29,791 --> 00:03:31,833
just to see her in a swimsuit!

54
00:03:31,916 --> 00:03:33,083
[YARIZUI] I win.

55
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,791
There's no beating
the president, guys.

56
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:36,541
What?
That bites!

57
00:03:36,625 --> 00:03:38,875
I really thought I had a chance
there, but I'm second place!

58
00:03:38,958 --> 00:03:40,083
Dang it!

59
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:42,291
Of course I had to
get stuck with the joker.

60
00:03:42,375 --> 00:03:43,916
At least I'm in third.

61
00:03:44,708 --> 00:03:46,875
Awww!
You're the Lowest Dirt!

62
00:03:46,958 --> 00:03:48,041
That's too bad!

63
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,708
[SATO] What the--?
How'd this even happen?

64
00:03:49,791 --> 00:03:51,333
I've got like a
million cards left.

65
00:03:51,416 --> 00:03:52,958
Well, maybe you
should've concentrated

66
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,041
on getting rid of 'em
instead of fantasizing.

67
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,458
I'm less than
impressed with

68
00:03:56,541 --> 00:03:58,833
your inability to
focus on the battle.

69
00:03:59,750 --> 00:04:01,166
[SATO] You want
focus, let's go again!

70
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:03,458
[SHAGA] Okay fine, round two!
It's your shuffle, genius!

71
00:04:03,541 --> 00:04:05,083
[SATO] Yeah, I'm aware of that.

72
00:04:05,166 --> 00:04:07,041
[SHAGA] Whoever's the
Lowest Dirt this round has

73
00:04:07,125 --> 00:04:09,375
to carry everyone's
bags when we get there!

74
00:04:12,875 --> 00:04:14,208
All right, which one
of you ladies

75
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:16,125
packed something
ridiculously heavy?

76
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,583
Oh, that would
be me, I'm really sorry.

77
00:04:18,666 --> 00:04:21,458
I couldn't make this trip
without my laptop, and I had to

78
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,625
bring my Oxford Dictionary
and my favorite anatomy book.

79
00:04:23,708 --> 00:04:25,833
[SATO] Why would you need
all that at a water park?

80
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,541
'Cause my novel.

81
00:04:27,625 --> 00:04:30,416
Detective Saito is lured to a
water park with free tickets

82
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,166
only to encounter a serial
killer who targets lifeguards,

83
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,750
but the detective
falls prey to his

84
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,583
evil scheme and is
publicly disgraced.

85
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,083
Well, that's the plotline
I was tinkering

86
00:04:38,166 --> 00:04:39,333
with late last night anyway.

87
00:04:39,416 --> 00:04:41,375
But that's pretty much
all I've got for now so

88
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,083
obviously I had to
come prepared just

89
00:04:43,166 --> 00:04:44,500
in case inspiration strikes me.

90
00:04:44,583 --> 00:04:46,791
[SATO] You couldn't just
pack a pen and notepad?

91
00:04:46,875 --> 00:04:47,666
And why do you
need an anatomy book?

92
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,291
[SHAGA] I'm missing a ticket.

93
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,666
That's really weird, I must've
dropped it somewhere on the way.

94
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,750
Oh well, I guess
it's not like we can go

95
00:04:53,833 --> 00:04:55,250
search the train for
it or anything.

96
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,416
Somebody's gotta pay.

97
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:57,583
Wait, you don't mean--

98
00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,625
Sorry, I don't have
any more passes.

99
00:04:59,708 --> 00:05:02,333
I'm using my
employee card to get in.

100
00:05:02,416 --> 00:05:04,750
[SATO] Take your bags at least!

101
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,750
[SATO] This sucks!
After I pay for the train home

102
00:05:08,833 --> 00:05:10,750
I'm only gonna have
three hundred yen left.

103
00:05:10,833 --> 00:05:12,250
Talk about the Lowest Dirt.

104
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,875
[NIKAIDO] Pervert?

105
00:05:14,625 --> 00:05:17,333
[NIKAIDO] This is the last place
I expected to run into you.

106
00:05:17,416 --> 00:05:18,625
Just my luck.

107
00:05:18,708 --> 00:05:19,916
Y'know,
I'd really appreciate it

108
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:21,291
if you'd stop
calling me Pervert!

109
00:05:21,375 --> 00:05:22,666
Would you stop
following me, Pervert?

110
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:24,583
This is the entrance,
we're both going inside, 

111
00:05:24,666 --> 00:05:26,791
and don't ever call
me that again, okay?

112
00:05:28,583 --> 00:05:30,333
Hey! Nikaido!

113
00:05:30,416 --> 00:05:33,541
I'm so glad you
could make it out!

114
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:34,791
Yeah.

115
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,041
What're you looking at?

116
00:05:40,125 --> 00:05:41,375
I'm just surprised
that you act so normal.

117
00:05:41,458 --> 00:05:42,375
Look, how many
times do I have to

118
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,541
tell you I'm not a pervert?

119
00:05:43,625 --> 00:05:45,541
Whatever. Doesn't matter
if you are or not

120
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:47,166
you're still stuck with
it as your nom de guerre.

121
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,666
[SATO] Huh?

122
00:05:48,750 --> 00:05:50,125
Listen man, I know you get
a kick outta messin' with me,

123
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:50,833
but don't make
any jokes about my--

124
00:05:50,916 --> 00:05:51,750
It's not a joke.

125
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:52,791
I spread the
name around already.

126
00:05:52,875 --> 00:05:54,875
Wait; hold on
a sec, you did what?

127
00:05:55,583 --> 00:05:57,416
[OSHIROI] Cut it out!
What're you doing?

128
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:59,250
Please stop pinching me!
Especially there!

129
00:05:59,333 --> 00:06:01,500
Hey. That sounds like
Oshiroi's voice.

130
00:06:01,583 --> 00:06:03,416
[SHAGA] Oh calm down,
you know you like it!

131
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,583
Wow!
Look how pink they are!

132
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:08,000
They're just begging
to be pinched!

133
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,416
What the hell're
you doing, Pervert?

134
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,458
I'm harnessing the power
of my mind to see through walls.

135
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:14,708
[SHAGA] Damn, Matsuba!

136
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:16,958
Your clothes really hide
those ginormous ta-tas.

137
00:06:17,041 --> 00:06:18,333
[MATSUBA] Ya think so?

138
00:06:18,416 --> 00:06:20,708
Well I've gotta reserve the
goods for my husband.

139
00:06:20,791 --> 00:06:22,000
[SHAGA] I bet you
grope 'em all the

140
00:06:22,083 --> 00:06:23,500
time to make 'em bigger, huh?

141
00:06:23,583 --> 00:06:27,250
[MATSUBA] You might wanna
borrow Oshiroi's anatomy book.

142
00:06:27,333 --> 00:06:28,791
[SHAGA] Really, Ice Witch?

143
00:06:28,875 --> 00:06:30,583
You wore your swimsuit under
your clothes the whole way here?

144
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,875
That's so middle school.

145
00:06:31,958 --> 00:06:33,666
[YARIZUI] It's a
time saving measure.

146
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,250
[SHAGA] What's wrong?

147
00:06:35,333 --> 00:06:36,958
[YARIZUI] I forgot my
spare pair of underwear.

148
00:06:37,041 --> 00:06:39,500
[SHAGA] I guess you're goin'
commando on the way home.

149
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,458
[YARIZUI] Looks like it.

150
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:45,166
[YARIZUI] Wait, here they are.

151
00:06:46,125 --> 00:06:49,083
[steel drum music playing]

152
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:55,000
Geez, whaddya think's
taking them so long?

153
00:06:55,083 --> 00:06:58,583
[SHAGA] Sato!
We're over here! Hey!

154
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:02,125
[OSHIROI] Look!
We locked down the perfect spot!

155
00:07:03,291 --> 00:07:05,708
[SATO] Oh, cool.
Thanks, great job.

156
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,291
[Sato groans]

157
00:07:12,375 --> 00:07:16,333
[SATO] I can see so
much skin. I'm dyin' here.

158
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,166
[YARIZUI] What's the deal?
Why are you staring at me?

159
00:07:19,250 --> 00:07:21,875
You're not about to make fun of
me for stretching, are you?

160
00:07:21,958 --> 00:07:23,833
No, of course not.
Don't be ridiculous!

161
00:07:23,916 --> 00:07:25,708
[YARIZUI] Oh,
so now I'm ridiculous?

162
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:27,500
[SATO] I didn't mean
it like that, Yarizui!

163
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:30,083
[MATSUBA] Oh, good.
You all found each other.

164
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:36,416
I'm gonna go hang out
in the café over there for a

165
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,666
little while, so try not
to get in any trouble.

166
00:07:40,916 --> 00:07:44,500
[YARIZUI] Well. Let's go.
Come on, follow me, Sato!

167
00:07:44,833 --> 00:07:46,041
[SATO] Uh, yeah!

168
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,791
[OSHIROI] Right behind you!
[SHAGA] Wait for me!

169
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,208
[SATO] Got it!

170
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:57,750
[Oshiroi giggles]

171
00:08:12,208 --> 00:08:14,583
[SATO] Good job, loser.

172
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:22,875
[SATO] Sorry, excuse me.

173
00:08:34,666 --> 00:08:36,333
"Hyoketsu Ice", huh?

174
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:39,416
I wonder if she--
Nah, that can't be it.

175
00:08:39,833 --> 00:08:41,208
Saito had a
weird feeling.

176
00:08:41,291 --> 00:08:42,375
[SATO] Hey Yarizui?

177
00:08:42,458 --> 00:08:44,166
I was just wondering,
how'd you wind

178
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,708
up with Ice Witch
as your nom de guerre?

179
00:08:49,291 --> 00:08:51,541
[SATO] Uh, I'm sorry. If
you're not comfortable talking

180
00:08:51,625 --> 00:08:53,166
about it just forget
I ever asked.

181
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:54,541
[YARIZUI] No,
it's not a big deal.

182
00:08:54,625 --> 00:08:57,166
I'd rather you hear
it from me anyway.

183
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,208
[YARIZUI] Well, you see,
it's kind of embarrassing,

184
00:09:01,291 --> 00:09:03,291
but I got the name
my freshman year.

185
00:09:03,375 --> 00:09:06,041
After a brawl, I went to
pay for my half-price bento

186
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:09,333
and I tried to buy a can of
Hyoketsu Ice along with it.

187
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,708
[SATO] Really?

188
00:09:10,791 --> 00:09:13,125
[YARIZUI] Calm down.
I wasn't trying to buy booze.

189
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:15,000
I only grabbed it
'cuz it was on sale

190
00:09:15,083 --> 00:09:16,708
and I liked the can's design.

191
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:19,208
I thought it was some
new flavored water.

192
00:09:19,291 --> 00:09:20,875
[SATO] Uh, okay.

193
00:09:20,958 --> 00:09:22,208
[YARIZUI]
It's not like I drank it.

194
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:24,375
The cashier didn't
even let me buy it.

195
00:09:24,458 --> 00:09:26,541
I was wearing my uniform
so it was obvious

196
00:09:26,625 --> 00:09:28,541
I was too young to drink.

197
00:09:30,833 --> 00:09:33,250
Okay guys, do you
have to look at me like that?

198
00:09:33,333 --> 00:09:35,750
Look at you like what?
So, how 'bout you, Shaga?

199
00:09:35,833 --> 00:09:37,375
The whole 'Beauty
by the Lake' thing.

200
00:09:37,458 --> 00:09:39,500
I'm sure there's gotta be an
interesting story behind that.

201
00:09:39,583 --> 00:09:40,583
Whoa!

202
00:09:40,666 --> 00:09:42,500
Way to put a girl
on the spot, Sato!

203
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:43,875
[SATO] You don't wanna
talk about yours either?

204
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:45,083
I just don't understand
why you're

205
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,875
asking me about
this all of a sudden.

206
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:49,875
Y'know you have to allow a girl
to keep some secrets to herself.

207
00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:51,500
If you really wanna
know, it's because she ate

208
00:09:51,583 --> 00:09:54,416
her first half-price bento in
Lake Park and as soon as she

209
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,708
was done eating
she passed out

210
00:09:55,791 --> 00:09:57,125
on the bench until
the next morning.

211
00:09:57,208 --> 00:09:58,875
Hey, did you
have to tell him?

212
00:10:01,083 --> 00:10:03,125
Wow, noms de guerre
seem kinda mean, huh?

213
00:10:03,208 --> 00:10:04,208
Yeah.

214
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,250
I was expecting
some cool back story.

215
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,125
[NIKAIDO] Well, it's not
like yours is that cool.

216
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,250
[YARIZUI] I didn't know Sato
has a nom de guerre now.

217
00:10:10,333 --> 00:10:11,666
What is it?

218
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,000
Just ignore him! Don't
listen to anything he says!

219
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,708
[announcement tones]

220
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:17,208
[PARK ANNOUNCER 7A] Aloha!
Thanks for visiting us today!

221
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:20,250
We now have a variety of
bento boxes ready to sell.

222
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:23,333
Come on by the poolside
café and enjoy a bite to eat!

223
00:10:23,416 --> 00:10:24,958
How can I help you?

224
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:26,958
[YARIZUI] Alright.
[SHAGA] I wonder.

225
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,541
[SATO] Oh, man, food.

226
00:10:28,625 --> 00:10:29,750
[Sato's stomach growls]

227
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,583
[SATO THINKS] This sucks.

228
00:10:31,666 --> 00:10:33,291
With the way my luck is
going today, it's pretty damn

229
00:10:33,375 --> 00:10:35,375
doubtful they're gonna
offer any discounts.

230
00:10:36,916 --> 00:10:38,208
[Oshiroi's stomach growls]

231
00:10:38,291 --> 00:10:40,750
[SATO] Sounds like
I'm not the only one.

232
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:47,833
Of course you're here.
I figured you might come.

233
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,625
Well, it's not
like we could turn

234
00:10:49,708 --> 00:10:51,458
down a personal
invitation from Macchan.

235
00:10:51,541 --> 00:10:54,125
[BRUNETTE] For real.
How could we say no to her?

236
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,333
[VENDOR 7A] Yo!

237
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,958
We've got your new
vending machines.

238
00:11:14,833 --> 00:11:16,000
[ASEBI] I made it!

239
00:11:16,083 --> 00:11:17,958
Good thing I rolled off
that truck and woke up!

240
00:11:18,041 --> 00:11:20,250
I sure hope this
free ticket's still valid

241
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:22,458
and they'll actually let me in.

242
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,958
[SHAGA] Ben-To.

243
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:39,875
Does it feel
tense to you guys?

244
00:11:39,958 --> 00:11:41,458
Hey, look who's
over there, Saito.

245
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,833
I'm sorry, I mean, Sato!

246
00:11:42,916 --> 00:11:44,250
[SATO] What're they doing here?

247
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:46,958
Hold on.
That can only mean one thing.

248
00:11:47,041 --> 00:11:48,458
[YARIZUI] Exactly.

249
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:51,041
The park's owned
by Ralph Store,

250
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:53,791
so they mark down
their bento here, too.

251
00:11:53,875 --> 00:11:55,416
Yeah. What, you
really didn't know that?

252
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,333
It's why this
place is so popular.

253
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,708
They offer half-price food
specials every Sunday

254
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,916
starting one hour before
closing the water park.

255
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,083
[Oshiroi's stomach growls]

256
00:12:04,166 --> 00:12:05,041
[Sato's stomach growls]

257
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:06,541
[SATO THINKS] Awesome.

258
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:09,541
I've still got a chance of
getting my stomach to shut up.

259
00:12:10,083 --> 00:12:12,375
They're rolling out
the discount cart right now.

260
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:14,541
Looks like those're
the half-price deals.

261
00:12:14,625 --> 00:12:16,625
[SATO] I think I've seen
those bentos before.

262
00:12:16,708 --> 00:12:18,750
[MATSUBA] Yeah, it wouldn't
surprise me if you have.

263
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,041
Since the park's
affiliated with Ralph Store,

264
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,625
it's stocked with the same food.

265
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:24,583
[OSHIROI] There are a couple of
'em I don't recognize though.

266
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,875
[SHAGA]
"Loco Moco Bulging Bento"?

267
00:12:26,958 --> 00:12:29,500
That one's gotta be exclusive
to the water park, huh?

268
00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:31,500
[MATSUBA] It's influenced
by Hawaiian cuisine,

269
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:33,833
but modified for
Japanese sensibilities.

270
00:12:33,916 --> 00:12:36,750
It's basically hamburger
patties on rice.

271
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:38,916
It comes with a fruit
salad and you scoop it

272
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,500
off into the lid, and then you
just microwave the meal.

273
00:12:42,583 --> 00:12:44,333
[OSHIROI] Yeah, that's
sounding pretty delicious to me.

274
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,750
[MATSUBA] It is.

275
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,083
The other box they're offering
is the Bosomelet Bento.

276
00:12:48,166 --> 00:12:49,791
It was actually
selected from a recipe

277
00:12:49,875 --> 00:12:51,666
contest amongst Ralph
Store employees.

278
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,291
They're doing an early
release for it in the

279
00:12:53,375 --> 00:12:54,958
area to see what people think.

280
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,666
Not to brag or anything,
but it's my recipe.

281
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:01,125
Their marketing people came up
with the silly name though.

282
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:04,166
There are two different flavors
of fried rice hidden beneath

283
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:07,625
the omelet and lining the tray,
and I added just a dash of

284
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:09,041
condensed milk to the omelet,

285
00:13:09,125 --> 00:13:11,500
so it has quite the
unique flavor to it.

286
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:14,541
[YARIZUI] Oh really?
Consider me enticed.

287
00:13:14,625 --> 00:13:17,208
[MATSUBA] I think the Loco
Moco Bulging bento is gonna

288
00:13:17,291 --> 00:13:19,875
get the laurel wreath seal,
but I stand by my

289
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:22,125
Bosomelet recipe and
I highly recommend it.

290
00:13:22,208 --> 00:13:23,791
[YARIZUI]
Thanks for the heads up.

291
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,041
So what do you guys think?

292
00:13:25,125 --> 00:13:27,333
Have you all decided
on your prey yet?

293
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:33,833
[SATO] Look! Here comes
the God of Discounts!

294
00:13:33,916 --> 00:13:36,666
[OSHIROI] Oh, man.
I wonder what he's like.

295
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,125
[SHAGA] Really?
That's him?

296
00:14:20,583 --> 00:14:22,541
Hey, what's that?

297
00:14:24,333 --> 00:14:26,625
[SATO] He's putting
the food in the pool?

298
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:28,875
[MATSUBA] Those are Super Fresh
Balls, they're specifically

299
00:14:28,958 --> 00:14:32,125
designed to allow bento brawls
to take place in the pool.

300
00:14:32,208 --> 00:14:33,958
They're still determining
their practicality.

301
00:14:34,041 --> 00:14:35,208
It seems like
it would make

302
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:36,791
the battle more unpredictable.

303
00:14:36,875 --> 00:14:39,791
With the motion of the water,
you never know what to expect.

304
00:14:39,875 --> 00:14:42,833
[SATO] Yeah, good point.
Regardless.

305
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:45,666
No matter what
situation we might face.

306
00:14:45,750 --> 00:14:48,458
We will do battle
as proud wolves!

307
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:52,000
[ALL] And we will
take what we desire!

308
00:14:57,708 --> 00:15:00,958
There's no running by
the poolside, okay you guys?

309
00:15:06,041 --> 00:15:07,291
[ASEBI] Wow!

310
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:10,333
It's a beach ball with
some kind of food inside!

311
00:15:11,958 --> 00:15:13,416
Ow! That hurts!

312
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,375
Why are my legs
cramping up on me?

313
00:15:15,458 --> 00:15:17,416
[BENTO BRAWLER 7B]
The chlorine's killing my eyes!

314
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,583
Perfect, now's
my chance!

315
00:15:22,583 --> 00:15:24,750
[BRUNETTE] You're chasing the
laurel wreath seal again, huh?

316
00:15:24,833 --> 00:15:28,125
You've gotten pretty ambitious
lately, haven't you, Pervert?

317
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,791
So he wasn't just
messing with me,

318
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,416
that's really my
nom de guerre?

319
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,916
I thought you knew.
Everybody else does.

320
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,166
Sorry but you're
stuck with it, pal.

321
00:15:36,250 --> 00:15:38,375
You're The Pervert now!

322
00:15:39,958 --> 00:15:42,541
It's mine now!

323
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:49,958
[SATO THINKS]
No! Don't look!

324
00:15:50,041 --> 00:15:52,000
Think of something else!
Anything!

325
00:15:52,083 --> 00:15:55,083
Resist the temptation if you
wanna be able to move!

326
00:15:55,166 --> 00:15:56,958
It's hopeless!

327
00:16:00,541 --> 00:16:02,166
[SHAGA] Sato!

328
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:04,666
[SATO] Shaga?

329
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,250
[SHAGA] Poor Sato.

330
00:16:08,333 --> 00:16:10,541
You looked like you were
having a hard time moving,

331
00:16:10,625 --> 00:16:12,375
so I thought I'd help you out.

332
00:16:19,333 --> 00:16:21,583
[NIKAIDO] It's right there!
You can do this, man!

333
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:24,083
I want that bosomelet
in my mouth!

334
00:16:28,416 --> 00:16:31,250
[NIKAIDO] It's mine!
Macchan created that dish,

335
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:34,125
so I wanna be the one
who feasts upon it!

336
00:16:34,208 --> 00:16:35,791
I have to!

337
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,833
[MATSUBA] A dash
of condensed milk!

338
00:16:38,750 --> 00:16:39,958
[NIKAIDO] I have to!

339
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,916
[MATSUBA] Fried rice!

340
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,791
[NIKAIDO] I have to-- 

341
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,833
I am less
than impressed

342
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:57,958
with your inability to
focus on the battle.

343
00:16:58,041 --> 00:17:00,041
Am I helping?

344
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,583
Damn it!

345
00:17:02,666 --> 00:17:03,791
[SHAGA] Really?

346
00:17:03,875 --> 00:17:06,166
Don't tell me you're
already dropping out?

347
00:17:07,208 --> 00:17:09,708
[SHAGA] Hey!
That's mine, dammit!

348
00:17:21,625 --> 00:17:23,125
Hey, are you alright?

349
00:17:23,208 --> 00:17:25,458
Ya sound like you're havin' a
hard time catchin' your breath.

350
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,125
[SHAGA] You're one to talk.

351
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,291
--Holy crap!
--You've gotta be kidding me!

352
00:17:33,375 --> 00:17:34,333
[GOATEE] He must be using the

353
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,333
wall jets for
maximum propulsion!

354
00:17:38,666 --> 00:17:40,041
[SHAGA] How is he that agile?

355
00:17:40,125 --> 00:17:42,333
[GOATEE] It's like he's got
a rudder between his legs!

356
00:17:42,875 --> 00:17:44,375
Did you just
say a rudder?

357
00:17:44,458 --> 00:17:47,958
There's no way.
It can't be that big!

358
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:50,375
[SHAGA] He's almost to it!

359
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,916
He actually got it!

360
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:12,291
I did it! I got
the laurel wreath seal!

361
00:18:12,375 --> 00:18:13,958
[SHAGA] Well.
There's his rudder.

362
00:18:14,041 --> 00:18:17,166
The Loco Moco Bulging
bento's all mine!

363
00:18:17,250 --> 00:18:19,958
Look at it!
It's huge!

364
00:18:20,041 --> 00:18:22,583
[SATO] Oh yeah!
I am the man!

365
00:18:22,666 --> 00:18:24,541
Uh.
Hey. Sato?

366
00:18:24,625 --> 00:18:26,916
Yeah, and he says
he's not a pervert.

367
00:18:29,541 --> 00:18:30,416
[SATO] No!

368
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,541
You want me to heat that up?

369
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:34,125
[YARIZUI] Yes, please.
What the hell?

370
00:18:34,208 --> 00:18:36,333
No, no, no. No! Oh no.
Oh no!

371
00:18:36,416 --> 00:18:37,958
[SHIRAUME] Hello, Sato.

372
00:18:38,041 --> 00:18:40,666
Oh great, what the heck
are you doing here, Shiraume?

373
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,500
That's really your biggest
concern right now?

374
00:18:42,583 --> 00:18:45,041
What strikes me as the biggest
issue at hand is the fact that

375
00:18:45,125 --> 00:18:47,500
you're exposing yourself
to the entire water park,

376
00:18:47,583 --> 00:18:50,041
and more
specifically, to Oshiroi.

377
00:18:50,125 --> 00:18:52,250
[SATO] Look, it's not like
I meant for this to happen!

378
00:18:52,333 --> 00:18:53,375
Where'd she--

379
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,875
[SHIRAUME]
Go put some clothes on.

380
00:18:59,958 --> 00:19:01,916
[UCHIMOTO] Wooo!

381
00:19:02,666 --> 00:19:04,625
[SHIRAUME] I'm terribly
sorry you had to see that.

382
00:19:04,708 --> 00:19:06,291
C'mon, it'll be okay.

383
00:19:06,375 --> 00:19:09,708
[SATO] Oh man, that
hurt but it was worth it.

384
00:19:11,708 --> 00:19:13,375
[YARIZUI] Nicely done, Sato.

385
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,958
I can't believe I missed your
moment of victory, though.

386
00:19:16,041 --> 00:19:17,750
I wish I could've seen it.

387
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:19,833
[SATO] Honestly,
it's probably for the

388
00:19:19,916 --> 00:19:21,333
best that you weren't around.

389
00:19:21,416 --> 00:19:22,833
[YARIZUI] And why's that?

390
00:19:22,916 --> 00:19:26,250
[SATO] Uh, anyway, check it out.
Another seal for the book!

391
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,708
Awesome.

392
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:30,791
[YARIZUI] We better
make sure we don't lose it

393
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:32,666
before we get back
to the club room.

394
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:35,333
Here.
I've got an idea.

395
00:19:37,458 --> 00:19:39,125
Why did you do that?

396
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,416
It's gonna be tough
for you to lose it now.

397
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,583
[SATO] Huh?
Are you serious?

398
00:19:43,666 --> 00:19:45,625
[YARIZUI] When am I not?

399
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:51,958
Okay, Yarizui,
if you insist.

400
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:53,166
[SHAGA] Oh, come on.

401
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,208
Are you really gonna
show it off like that?

402
00:19:55,875 --> 00:19:58,000
[SATO] I see you
got a bento, too.

403
00:19:58,083 --> 00:19:59,916
Yep. It was just floating
around out there and

404
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,375
nobody seemed to notice it,
so I swam over and grabbed it.

405
00:20:02,458 --> 00:20:03,875
[YARIZUI] Funny
how it works out.

406
00:20:03,958 --> 00:20:06,541
Yet another reason these
brawls are so interesting.

407
00:20:06,625 --> 00:20:07,625
Well, then.

408
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,916
What're we waiting for,
let's dig in.

409
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,500
[SATO] Right!

410
00:20:11,583 --> 00:20:13,500
[ALL]
Thank you for the meal!

411
00:20:18,583 --> 00:20:19,875
[YARIZUI] Let's see.

412
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:23,583
Wow.
She wasn't kidding.

413
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,666
This really is a unique omelet.
It has such a rich flavor to it.

414
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:28,708
The fried rice is
seasoned with vinegar

415
00:20:28,791 --> 00:20:30,916
so it complements
the eggs nicely.

416
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:32,750
[SATO] Mind if I have a bite?

417
00:20:32,833 --> 00:20:34,125
[YARIZUI]
Not at all. Go for it.

418
00:20:34,208 --> 00:20:36,500
[SHAGA] Me too!
I want one of your patties!

419
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,916
[SATO] I would've given you
a bite, but not half of it!

420
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:42,333
Oh my gosh, the sauce
on it is so tangy and delicious!

421
00:20:42,416 --> 00:20:43,708
No wonder it got the seal!

422
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:45,333
You're sharin'
your pork with me!

423
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:46,208
No way!

424
00:20:46,291 --> 00:20:47,375
[SATO] Hand it over, dammit!

425
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:50,666
I thought you
wanted a bite?

426
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:52,833
[SATO] Yes, I do!
Thank you!

427
00:20:54,541 --> 00:20:56,166
[MATSUBA] Hey Nikaido?

428
00:20:56,750 --> 00:20:58,875
I made this before
we left earlier today

429
00:20:58,958 --> 00:21:01,041
but I can't eat
it all by myself.

430
00:21:01,125 --> 00:21:02,666
You wanna share?

431
00:21:04,208 --> 00:21:05,625
I'd love to!

432
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:10,500
Oh, wow.

433
00:21:10,583 --> 00:21:12,916
Those're some
succulent bosomelets!

434
00:21:16,708 --> 00:21:20,500
[SATO] Alright, Yarizui.
I guess we should pack up.

435
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:39,250
[closing song]

436
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,666
[girl singing in Japanese]

437
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:13,541
This place has everything
you could ask for.

438
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,208
Hey, is there something
wrong, Beauty?

439
00:23:16,291 --> 00:23:17,666
Oh, it's nothing really.

440
00:23:17,750 --> 00:23:19,666
I could've sworn I saw
Asebi during the brawl

441
00:23:19,750 --> 00:23:22,041
but I must've confused
her with somebody else.

442
00:23:23,750 --> 00:23:26,458
That is by far the most
fun I've ever had in a sew--

443
00:23:26,541 --> 00:23:27,791
Well, whatever...

444
00:23:27,875 --> 00:23:29,083
We should prob'ly hurry up
and get to the preview.

445
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:31,333
Really? Is it that
time again already?

446
00:23:33,958 --> 00:23:35,375
What's it
gonna be about?

447
00:23:35,458 --> 00:23:37,250
The touch of evil
reaches out for Sato

448
00:23:37,333 --> 00:23:39,291
after he suffers an
unfortunate accident.

449
00:23:39,375 --> 00:23:40,666
And the episode's highlight?

450
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:42,250
The characters
briefly introduced

451
00:23:42,333 --> 00:23:44,000
today will get more screen time.

452
00:23:44,083 --> 00:23:45,916
And you can count on that!

453
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:46,958
Just watch it.
