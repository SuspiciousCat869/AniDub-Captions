00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:37,625
Nooooooo!!!

00:00:49,166 --> 00:00:50,541
[ASEBI]
Wow.

6
00:00:51,583 --> 00:00:54,166
[ASEBI] Looks like
another beautiful day!

7
00:00:56,666 --> 00:00:58,583
[SHAGA] You want
to make a bento for Sato?

8
00:00:58,666 --> 00:00:59,875
Are you serious?

9
00:00:59,958 --> 00:01:00,916
[ASEBI] Uh-huh!

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,958
I mean he ate a
whole bunch of those

11
00:01:02,041 --> 00:01:03,416
cookies I made the other day,

12
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:06,208
so I figure he must like
my cooking an awful lot!

13
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,041
So that means
he'd probably be super

14
00:01:08,125 --> 00:01:10,583
happy if I made him
a full-fledged bento!

15
00:01:10,666 --> 00:01:13,208
Oh. Yeah, I guess
that makes sense.

16
00:01:13,291 --> 00:01:16,708
I'm gonna make it
extra big in case he's hungry!

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:26,500
That's great!
Uh, good idea!

18
00:01:26,583 --> 00:01:28,625
Yeah.
I'm sure he'll love it!

19
00:01:28,708 --> 00:01:31,416
Well, I hope so!
Anyway, bye!

20
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:33,916
I gotta get cooking pretty soon!

21
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
[SHAGA] All right,
give it your best shot!

22
00:01:36,083 --> 00:01:37,791
[ASEBI] I sure will!

23
00:01:37,875 --> 00:01:40,708
[SHAGA] Poor Sato.
He's so dead.

24

doing at my school?

Go!

30
00:02:36,750 --> 00:02:40,875
[OSHIROI] So, Sato, what
happened to your cheek?

31
00:02:40,958 --> 00:02:43,333
[SATO] Well, how
should I put this?

32
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:46,541
Let's just say a wild
animal attacked me.

33
00:02:46,625 --> 00:02:47,791
[OSHIROI] Hold on,

34
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,583
are you telling me you
were ra--ra--ra--ra--

35
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:54,083
Not even close.
You need to calm down.

00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:56,625
[YARIZUI] Here.
This ought to help.

37
00:02:56,708 --> 00:02:59,875
Hey. Thanks, Yarizui,
I really appreciate it.

38
00:03:00,916 --> 00:03:01,958
Do you think
it would be best to

39
00:03:02,041 --> 00:03:03,250
skip out on tonight's brawl?

40
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,208
No way!
I'm not missing it!

41
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,541
[ASEBI] Wait!

42
00:03:08,208 --> 00:03:09,375

43
00:03:09,458 --> 00:03:10,791
Uh, hey.

44
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:12,791
[SATO] Hi, Asebi.

45
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,875
I'll lend you my good
luck charm just this once.

46
00:03:16,958 --> 00:03:19,041
You're gonna thank me later.

47
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:20,875
Hope you're hungry.

48
00:03:20,958 --> 00:03:22,833
I made a special
bento just for you!

49
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:25,291
Huh?
For me?

50
00:03:30,958 --> 00:03:33,083
[SATO THINKS] Jeez, Shaga.
Don't scare me like that.

51
00:03:33,166 --> 00:03:34,458
I was afraid she
was gonna pull out

52
00:03:34,541 --> 00:03:36,625
something weird,
but this looks awesome.

53
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,541
Well, here I go!

54
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,541
Okay! Dig in!

55
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:43,458
[SATO THINKS] First,
let's try the pork filet.

56
00:03:48,583 --> 00:03:51,000
[SATO THINKS] Wha--
what the hell is this?

57
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:52,875
Looking at it,
it has to be a pork filet,

58
00:03:52,958 --> 00:03:57,541
but the flavor is--It
tastes like banana?

59
00:04:01,875 --> 00:04:06,291
That's not right.
This tastes like raw tuna!

60
00:04:09,708 --> 00:04:11,166
It's sweet!

61
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:15,083
Like it was covered in sugar, or
honey, or soda or something!

62
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:19,250
[SATO THINKS] Whoa!
It's spicy!

63
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:23,041
But why?
And do I dare try this one?

64
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,083
[SATO THINKING] It doesn't
taste like anything!

65
00:04:28,166 --> 00:04:31,500
But--but at least the
rice won't betray me!

66
00:04:34,041 --> 00:04:37,083
[SATO THINKS] Coriander?
But it's rice!

67
00:04:39,583 --> 00:04:41,833
[SATO THINKS] I don't even know
what I'm eating anymore.

68
00:04:41,916 --> 00:04:44,750
It's over.
It's all over.

69
00:04:45,250 --> 00:04:48,583
My taste buds are
completely wrecked.

70
00:04:48,666 --> 00:04:50,458
So?
Is it good?

71
00:04:50,541 --> 00:04:52,666
Yeah.
It's great.

72
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,250
Okay. Better eat
every last bite!

73
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:59,000
Uh. Sure.
You bet I will!

74
00:04:59,083 --> 00:05:01,583
Wow. Your sweat
is so beautiful!

00:05:01,666 --> 00:05:03,708

That's--no, never mind.

to ignore her for now.

00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:25,791
You have no idea
what I've been through!

86
00:07:26,208 --> 00:07:27,833
[SATO] You gotta find
me something to wear!

87
00:07:27,916 --> 00:07:29,833
Please!
It's an emergency!

00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,583
This boy is from your school.

92
00:07:47,666 --> 00:07:51,375
Am I correct? His name
is Yo Sato, I believe.

93
00:07:51,458 --> 00:07:53,208
Yes.
That's correct.

94
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:54,291
[SAWAGI PRES] Excellent.

95
00:07:54,375 --> 00:07:55,625
Now that you've
confirmed his identity

96
00:07:55,708 --> 00:07:57,125
and seen the
footage we captured,

97
00:07:57,208 --> 00:07:59,708
will you also confirm that
this is an act of trespassing,

98
00:07:59,791 --> 00:08:01,416
along with what can
only be described

99
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,708
as public indecency and
disturbing the peace?

100
00:08:03,791 --> 00:08:06,750
[SHIRAUME] Indeed.
It's just as you say.

101
00:08:08,041 --> 00:08:09,375
Very well then...

On behalf of Marutomi High
School, in response to the

103
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,291
strange and perverse
display we've seen just now,

104
00:08:14,375 --> 00:08:16,958
we demand a written
apology from your school.

105
00:08:19,458 --> 00:08:20,833
[SAWAGI VP]
Despite these conditions.

106
00:08:20,916 --> 00:08:22,833
I do believe that it
would be best to resolve

107
00:08:22,916 --> 00:08:25,583
this matter privately to
avoid creating a scandal.

108
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:27,000
[SHIRAUME]
I couldn't agree more.

109
00:08:27,083 --> 00:08:29,416
I was going to
suggest the same thing.

110
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,541
[SHIRAUME] This girl is
from your school, yes?

111
00:08:34,625 --> 00:08:37,125
I believe her name
is Ayame Shaga.

112
00:08:37,208 --> 00:08:39,708
We have determined,
that in addition to the lewd

113
00:08:39,791 --> 00:08:43,416
acts depicted here, she has
trespassed on school property

114
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,250
on numerous occasions
without authorization.

115
00:08:46,333 --> 00:08:47,875
To facilitate these actions,

116
00:08:47,958 --> 00:08:50,791
she also acquired one of
our school's uniforms,

117
00:08:50,875 --> 00:08:52,708
and has been
brazenly attempting to

118
00:08:52,791 --> 00:08:54,583
blend in with the rest
of the students.

119
00:08:54,666 --> 00:08:56,541
How unfortunate.

120
00:08:58,375 --> 00:08:59,583
[SAWAGI PRES]
Let's put this behind us.

121
00:08:59,666 --> 00:09:01,750
I suggest we reach
an agreement that will

122
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:04,208
preserve the relationship
between our two schools.

123
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:07,000
We are equals, after all.

124
00:09:07,083 --> 00:09:08,000
Yes.

125
00:09:08,083 --> 00:09:10,250
I think that's a
splendid proposal.

126
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:12,208
But there's one thing to settle.

127

[SHIRAUME] On behalf
of Karasuda High

128
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:20,166
I demand a written
apology from your school.

129
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,625
And that's final.

130
00:09:21,708 --> 00:09:23,083
I will continue
this conversation

131
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,333
once you agree
to that condition.

132

[both laugh]

133
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:39,000
[SAWAGI PRES]
It's not fair, Kyo!

134
00:09:39,083 --> 00:09:42,833
I don't wanna apologize to her!
She's so mean!

135
00:09:43,333 --> 00:09:44,666
I warned you that
this might happen

136
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:47,291
if you rubbed it in
too much, didn't I?

137
00:09:47,375 --> 00:09:49,250
The written apology
document was to be used

138
00:09:49,333 --> 00:09:51,750
as a last resort,
not something to flaunt around.

139
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:52,958
I know!

140
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:54,833
But you saw her--she
was so full of herself!

141
00:09:54,916 --> 00:09:57,583
I wanted to wipe
that smug look off her face!

142
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:01,416
Kyo!

143
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,583
C'mon.
Look on the bright side,

144
00:10:03,666 --> 00:10:06,708
it's not as if we lost anything,
it was just a tie.

145
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:10,208
Besides, the information
we learned about

146
00:10:10,291 --> 00:10:13,083
those Wolves is worth
more than any apology.

147
00:10:15,541 --> 00:10:19,208
[SHIRAUME] Thanks to you.
I was humiliated today.

00:11:25,666 --> 00:11:27,625
[OSHIROI]
"What's wrong, Saito?"

160
00:11:27,708 --> 00:11:29,541
"You're glistening with sweat!

161
00:11:29,625 --> 00:11:31,625
Finally feeling the
heat, are you?"

162
00:11:31,708 --> 00:11:33,333
[OSHIROI]
"What have you done?

163
00:11:33,416 --> 00:11:35,333
My body's on fire!"

164
00:11:35,416 --> 00:11:37,958
[OSHIROI] Saito tries to resist.

165
00:11:38,041 --> 00:11:42,291
[OSHIROI] But his willpower--
is rapidly fading,

166
00:11:42,375 --> 00:11:45,875
as he is overwhelmed with
the lust of a salacious beast!

167
00:11:45,958 --> 00:11:48,416
[OSHIROI] Will he give in?
Find out next time!

168
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,000
[OSHIROI]
I really outdid myself!

169
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:04,041
[OSHIROI] Oh wow, I got a whole
lot of hits on the site today!

170
00:12:04,125 --> 00:12:05,583
Let me see.

171
00:12:05,666 --> 00:12:08,166
I'm looking at well over ten
thousand views for this week.

172
00:12:08,250 --> 00:12:10,166
I must have some new readers!

173
00:12:10,916 --> 00:12:14,333
[notification sound]

174
00:12:14,416 --> 00:12:15,708
It's Ume.

175
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:19,666
Hello Oshiroi, how are you?

176
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,750
[OSHIROI] Fine, but--

177
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:22,291
[SHIRAUME]
Did I call at a bad time?

178
00:12:22,375 --> 00:12:25,208
[OSHIROI] No, not really.
I was just a little startled,

179
00:12:25,291 --> 00:12:28,333
since you're calling a bit
earlier than you usually do.

180
00:12:28,416 --> 00:12:30,333
I'm sorry. I was suddenly
struck with the

181
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:33,708
need to see your face
and I just couldn't resist.

182
00:12:34,625 --> 00:12:37,000
Speaking of which,
your cheeks are a bit red.

183
00:12:37,083 --> 00:12:38,750
Oh, really?

184
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:40,708
[SHIRAUME] You don't happen
to have a fever, do you?

185
00:12:40,791 --> 00:12:44,000
No, it's not that.

186
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:45,333
[SHIRAUME] Perhaps,
you would like me to

187
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,000
stop by and check on you?

188
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,541
Oh no,
I think I'll be fine!

189
00:12:49,625 --> 00:12:51,708
There's no need for that!

190
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,833
[Oshiroi cries out]

191
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:06,708
[SHIRAUME] Are you okay?
What's wrong, Oshiroi?

192
00:13:06,791 --> 00:13:08,500
Ow, my head!

193
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,000
No! Saito!

194
00:13:15,083 --> 00:13:17,541
Please don't die on me, Saito!

195
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:24,250
Gone. It's all gone.

196
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,458
[OSHIROI] I'm sorry, Saito.
Rest in peace.

197
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,166
[SHIRAUME] Oshiroi?
Did something happen?

198
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,291
Hello?

199
00:13:48,833 --> 00:13:49,958
[SATO] Ben-To.

200
00:14:00,750 --> 00:14:01,875
Ume?

201
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:08,875
[SHIRAUME] You
shouldn't exert yourself.

202
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:11,125
It's all right now.

203
00:14:11,208 --> 00:14:13,750
I promise that I'll take
very good care of you.

204
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,791
There's nothing to
worry about anymore.

205
00:14:15,875 --> 00:14:17,333
Just relax.

206
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,250
[OSHIROI] Well,
I wasn't really worried

207
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,875
about anything to begin with.

208
00:14:20,958 --> 00:14:22,958
Also, when did you get here?

209
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:25,375
[SHIRAUME] I came as
soon as I saw you pass out.

210
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:26,708
[OSHIROI]
"Pass out"?

211
00:14:26,791 --> 00:14:28,333
Perhaps your
memory is fuzzy,

212
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:31,125
but you let out a scream
when we were chatting earlier.

213
00:14:31,208 --> 00:14:33,416
While the camera seemed
to be malfunctioning,

214
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,791
it appeared that you had
collapsed on your bed.

215
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,041
I didn't collapse so
much as I just went to sleep.

216
00:14:39,125 --> 00:14:40,125
Poor thing.

217
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:42,583
You really frightened
me, you know.

218
00:14:42,666 --> 00:14:46,583
So, I quickly changed your
clothes, and tucked you in.

219
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,833
[OSHIROI] You what?

220
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,458
I took your clothes off.

221
00:14:55,166 --> 00:14:58,125
[SHIRAUME] And of course.
Your underwear.

222
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,333
[SHIRAUME] Oh no, this won't do.

223
00:15:03,791 --> 00:15:07,083
Look, your cheeks
are burning up.

224
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,916
[OSHIROI] Yeah, but I mean,
uh-- it's not a fever.

225
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:12,250
[SHIRAUME] I'm here for you,

226
00:15:12,333 --> 00:15:14,416
it's okay to admit
that you're sick.

227
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:16,958
No, you've got
it all wrong.

228
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:19,625
I'm telling you,
I don't have a fever.

229
00:15:19,708 --> 00:15:22,416
[OSHIROI] If you don't believe
me, use a thermometer.

230
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,833
Why would I lie?

231
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:27,583
Yes, of course.
I did already.

232
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:29,125
But this one is broken.

233
00:15:29,208 --> 00:15:31,458
It said your temperature
was normal.

234
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:36,416
[SHIRAUME]
There lie down and rest a bit.

235
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,666
[OSHIROI] Uh, sure.

236
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:42,458
Don't be afraid.
I'll be right here by your side.

237
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,625
'Kay.

238
00:15:53,666 --> 00:15:55,000
[stomach growl]

239
00:15:57,125 --> 00:15:59,708
Oh my. You want
a late night snack?

240
00:15:59,791 --> 00:16:02,625
Oh, uh--I--
I guess so.

241
00:16:02,708 --> 00:16:04,916
I had a feeling
that this might happen,

242
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,833
so I prepared some food for you.

243
00:16:06,916 --> 00:16:07,833
Oh.

244
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,583
Wow!
A rice porridge bento!

245
00:16:13,666 --> 00:16:15,125
I went home and
made it when your fever

246
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:17,708
started to pass so I
assure you, it's quite fresh.

247
00:16:17,791 --> 00:16:20,333
That's nice,
but my fever passed

248
00:16:20,416 --> 00:16:22,458
because I never had
one in the first place.

249
00:16:22,541 --> 00:16:23,875
[SHIRAUME]
I kept it in a thermos,

250
00:16:23,958 --> 00:16:25,666
so it's the perfect temperature.

251
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,000
Eat it all while
it's still warm.

252
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:30,375
All of it?
Are you sure?

253
00:16:30,458 --> 00:16:32,708
Of course.
I made it just for you,

254
00:16:32,791 --> 00:16:35,500
so you don't have
to worry about sharing.

255
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:38,208
Did I get it right?

256
00:16:38,291 --> 00:16:39,250
[OSHIROI] Yep!

257
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,208
A little salty,
just how I like it.

258
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:44,583
I'm glad. There's a
bit on your face.

259
00:16:45,208 --> 00:16:47,083
Eat every last bite,
and I'm sure

260
00:16:47,166 --> 00:16:48,500
you'll feel better in no time.

261
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,083
I guess so, but I
was fine to begin with.

262
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,208
[SHIRAUME] Let's see.

263
00:16:52,291 --> 00:16:54,083
Would you like some
fried salmon too?

264
00:16:54,166 --> 00:16:55,875
Oh.
Yes, please.

265
00:16:55,958 --> 00:16:57,083
Here.

266
00:16:58,125 --> 00:17:00,416
You were so hot,
we should wipe all

267
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,541
that sweat off your
body when you're done.

268
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:07,250
[OSHIROI] Huh?
Ume?

269
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:11,958
I think I'm gonna be fine.
I didn't sweat more than usual.

270
00:17:12,041 --> 00:17:14,750
[SHIRAUME] You don't
have to act so brave.

271
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:18,833
If you neglect to clean
yourself at a time like this,

272
00:17:18,916 --> 00:17:21,333
you could end up with a rash
or something even worse.

273
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,541
[OSHIROI] Yeah, but--

274
00:17:22,625 --> 00:17:25,458
It's all right. Now turn
around and face me.

275
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:27,208
I'd rather not.

276
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,375
I'm doing this
for your own good.

277
00:17:36,458 --> 00:17:40,125
[OSHIROI] I know, but--This
is really embarrassing!

278
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,750
We've taken baths
together countless times.

279
00:17:42,833 --> 00:17:44,500
Why are you so shy now?

280
00:17:44,583 --> 00:17:49,666
'Cause, well,
that's not the same.

281
00:17:49,750 --> 00:17:51,750
I completely understand.

282
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:53,625
What?

283
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:57,583
When we took a bath
we were both naked,

284
00:17:57,666 --> 00:17:59,500
so I need to strip as well.

285
00:18:01,666 --> 00:18:04,791
[OSHIROI] Ume.
Please don't.

286
00:18:05,125 --> 00:18:09,750
I don't like it.
No more!

287
00:18:14,833 --> 00:18:16,000
[SHIRAUME] Hey, Oshiroi.

288
00:18:16,083 --> 00:18:17,041
[OSHIROI] Can we just stop?

289
00:18:17,125 --> 00:18:19,041
[SHIRAUME] Did
something just fall?

290
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:24,166
Why are
you so scared?

291
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,875
[SHIRAUME] What
kind of book is this?

292
00:18:35,208 --> 00:18:38,541
[OSHIROI] Oh, it's a-- just--

293
00:18:40,791 --> 00:18:43,500
[OSHIROI] What in
the hell was that?

294
00:18:50,833 --> 00:18:53,833
Hey, Sato. You have
got to check this out!

295
00:18:55,291 --> 00:18:56,333
Come on.

296
00:18:56,416 --> 00:18:58,500
I promise, this is
right up your alley.

297

Borrow it for a while.

298
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,416
I've already had
my fun, trust me.

299
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:07,833
What's wrong?

300
00:19:07,916 --> 00:19:10,500
It's fine! I know
you're into this stuff!

we were bros!

Don't you like this?

00:19:32,083 --> 00:19:33,791
[SATO] Look,
I told you, I'm not--

You have some very
interesting hobbies, don't you?

00:19:51,208 --> 00:19:53,666
like this doing
in Oshiroi's room?

315
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,375
I don't know!
And I don't really care, either!

316
00:19:56,458 --> 00:19:58,708
[SHIRAUME]
Don't play dumb with me.

317
00:20:01,625 --> 00:20:03,916
[SHIRAUME] Would you stop
harassing poor Oshiroi?

318
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:06,041
You should be ashamed
of yourself, making this smut.

319
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:08,666
You seriously
think I put that together?

320
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,166
[SHIRAUME] Then who did?

321
00:20:10,250 --> 00:20:12,541
Why else would
Oshiroi have this book?

322
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:20,041
She likes muscles!

323
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:22,666
She's writing a novel!
You haven't read it, have you?

324
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,500
It's full of muscle men!

325
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,666
And one of
the characters in this

326
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:28,833
messed up story of
hers is based on me!

327
00:20:31,583 --> 00:20:33,208
I guess she put
my face on those dudes

328
00:20:33,291 --> 00:20:35,750
to make her weird fantasy
just a little more real--

329
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,833
[SHIRAUME] For you information,
I read Oshiroi's writings

330
00:20:38,916 --> 00:20:40,500
every time she updates her page.

331
00:20:40,583 --> 00:20:43,541
And I assure you, they have none
of the smut you mentioned.

332
00:20:43,625 --> 00:20:46,500
I'm also certain
that Oshiroi would never

333
00:20:46,583 --> 00:20:48,541
make a tasteless
collage like this.

334
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:50,750
Not in a million years.

335
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:53,791
And if you think she
based a character off of you,

336
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,708
you are simply delusional.

337
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:57,541
[GIRL STUDENT 9C]
Hey, what's this?

338
00:21:00,208 --> 00:21:02,291
Now you've made
me angry.

339
00:21:02,791 --> 00:21:04,875
[punching and Sato cries out]

340
00:21:04,958 --> 00:21:06,166
[UCHIMOTO] So hot.

341
00:21:06,250 --> 00:21:08,125
[GIRL STUDENT 9C]
Oh my gosh, he is so gross.

342
00:21:08,208 --> 00:21:09,250
[GIRL STUDENT 9D]
What a pervert.

343
00:21:09,333 --> 00:21:11,125
He's such a pathetic loser.

344
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:12,833
[GIRL STUDENT 9C] Somebody
should neuter this freak.

345
00:21:12,916 --> 00:21:13,541
[GIRL STUDENT 9D]
"Freak"?

346
00:21:13,625 --> 00:21:14,916
He's more like a worm.

347
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:18,583
You scored, Sato!
Verbal abuse, too!

348
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,083
[SATO THINKS] On the upside.

349
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,208
[GIRL STUDENT 9C] So disgusting.

350
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,625
[GIRL STUDENT 9D] Just die!

351
00:21:25,958 --> 00:21:28,791
[SATO] At least
the view is nice.

352
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,375
[closing song]

353
00:21:39,708 --> 00:21:41,666
[girl singing in Japanese]

354
00:23:04,541 --> 00:23:06,708
[YARIZUI] They say when you
sneeze, someone is talking

355
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:09,958
about you, but what
about three sneezes?

356
00:23:10,541 --> 00:23:13,375
Someone fell for you.
Is that it?

357
00:23:15,541 --> 00:23:17,666
[YARIZUI]
Well, it's silly anyway.

358
00:23:18,875 --> 00:23:20,166
[sneeze]

359
00:23:21,791 --> 00:23:25,041
[YARIZUI] Wait, four?
What does four sneezes mean?

360
00:23:25,125 --> 00:23:26,708
Hm.

361
00:23:33,916 --> 00:23:35,458
Don't miss the next episode!

362
00:23:35,541 --> 00:23:37,583
Who, knows what
might happen when--

363
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,291
Actually,
I have no idea what's

364
00:23:40,375 --> 00:23:42,541
going to happen,
nobody told me! Help!

365
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,500
Next time.
Why don't we take a pass on

366
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:46,958
doing the episode
preview, 'kay, Sis?
