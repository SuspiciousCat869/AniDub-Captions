Thank you for shopping with us!

[SATO] Have you heard the
cliché about a young man

8
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:07,916
waking up to find a
beautiful girl in his bed?

I didn't think that ever
happened in real life,

Too bad she's my cousin.

The hell is your problem?
Keep it down!

13
00:02:21,958 --> 00:02:24,125
[SATO] My bad.
Sorry about that.

14
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,750
[SATO] Gotta go!

15
00:02:29,458 --> 00:02:31,708
Back in the day you
only had a couple of these dirty

16
00:02:31,791 --> 00:02:33,708

to keep them hidden

but you've got no shame now.

Looks like you've
gone full-blown perv.

Oh my goodness,
it's all so scandalous.

[SATO] Stop!
They're not mine, all right?

This kid named Uchimoto

I just don't understand how
I ended up in the friend zone.

32
00:03:13,375 --> 00:03:15,541
And I don't understand
how warming up your voice

33
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:18,416
is related to what you're
trying to do right now.

34
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,041
Yeah, good point!

35
00:03:21,708 --> 00:03:23,458
So, what's
goin' on anyway?

What made you come
all the way here?

37

Well, I came
because I wanna

00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:28,416
know how I ended
up in the friend--

39

[SATO] All right.
That's enough, Shaga.

40
00:03:30,625 --> 00:03:32,833
You've gotta at least
try a different tactic.

41
00:03:32,916 --> 00:03:34,208
Now why're you here?

See, the
friend zone isn't--

[SATO] This is pointless.

C'mon, just
one more time!

[SATO] Do you always wear
your uniform on weekends?

Oh no.

91
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:43,958
First, I couldn't decide what
to wear, then I ran out of time

92

trying stuff on, so I
ended up stuck with this.

if it was a little loose

something Sato,

is she normally like this
or has she gone insane?

that no means no?

is she adorable,

wanna feel her up, too?

it or not,

00:08:17,208 --> 00:08:18,291
school girls' uniform and

158
00:08:18,375 --> 00:08:20,375
infiltrates the
suspect's hideout."

159
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:22,250
"However Monk,
the dastardly perpetrator,

160
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,583
can easily see
through Saito's disguise."

161
00:08:24,666 --> 00:08:27,083
Saito, huh?
And Monk's in there?

162
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:29,583
You take over Ice Witch,
I'm getting bored with this.

163
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,125
"Wait a second, I'm not
really a high school girl".

164
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:35,041
"I know, Saito. I've waited
for you for so long."

165
00:08:35,125 --> 00:08:36,958
"Stop it, take
your hands off me".

166
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,166
Oh my.

167
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:39,541
"What's the matter big boy,

168
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:41,708
is this your first
time or something?"

169
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:47,250
So is this type
of thing

170
00:08:47,333 --> 00:08:50,125
popular with the kids nowadays?

171
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:51,958
They're gonna
eat you alive!

172
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,083
Get up! get back
out there and fight!

173
00:08:54,166 --> 00:08:55,333
I've got faith in you!

174
00:08:55,416 --> 00:08:56,708
He's getting in touch
with his feminine side!

175
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:58,458
I knew it!

176
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,125
[SATO] Crap, it's Shiraume!

177
00:09:02,208 --> 00:09:03,125
[SHIRAUME] What did
you do to Oshiroi?

178
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:04,250
[OSHIROI] Sato!
Run for your life!

179
00:09:04,333 --> 00:09:05,458
[SHIRAUME] 
Start talking!

180
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:06,958
You'd better spill it
or I will hurt you.

181
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,833
[SATO] I'm not the
one at fault, trust me.

182
00:09:08,916 --> 00:09:11,416
[SHAGA] Hey, why'd you go
and put your bra back on?

183
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,041
You want me to take
it off again, dontcha?

184
00:09:13,125 --> 00:09:14,916
[OSHIROI] No!
Please let me go!

185
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,416
See, what'd I tell ya?

186
00:09:17,166 --> 00:09:19,750
So you're the one
who's responsible for all this!

187
00:09:19,833 --> 00:09:21,000
Hold up, what?

188
00:09:21,083 --> 00:09:22,500
[SHIRAUME] Do you
go to our school?

189
00:09:22,583 --> 00:09:24,125
I've never seen you before.

190
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:26,708
I'm a first year at
Marutomi University High.

191
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,583
The name's Ayame Shaga.

192
00:09:28,666 --> 00:09:29,708
[SHIRAUME] I see.

193
00:09:29,791 --> 00:09:32,250
Where'd you get
this uniform, Shaga?

194
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:34,000
I borrowed it from
your adorable friend here.

195
00:09:34,083 --> 00:09:35,416
Sato got it for me.

196
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,958
[SHIRAUME] I see. Once again,
your insolence has left

197
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,458
me with no other
choice in the matter!

198
00:09:45,708 --> 00:09:47,166
Suck on that.

199
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:49,833
Hopefully next time he'll know
not to act like such a tool.

200
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:52,500
But the question remains,
what do I do with you?

201
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:55,833
I'd mess up your pretty hair,
but you beat me to it.

202
00:09:55,916 --> 00:09:56,708
Oh stop.

203
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:57,916
[SHIRAUME] For your own sake,

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,916
I demand that you take
a bath immediately.

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,125
[SHAGA] Wait, what?

206
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:02,833
[SHIRAUME] Do you prefer
your bathwater warm?

207
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,166
Or hot?

208
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:05,541
Hey, wait a second,
don't you think

209
00:10:05,625 --> 00:10:08,125
maybe we should
discuss this first?

210
00:10:10,666 --> 00:10:13,666
Man, that girl is scary.

211
00:10:15,291 --> 00:10:17,041
[ENDO] Gimme a
status report.

212
00:10:17,125 --> 00:10:18,250
[NIKAIDO] Yes, sir.

213
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,916
I've gathered all the
intel I can find on

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,208
Wolves in the Western Territory
with a <i>nom de guerre</i> .

215
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:26,875
The only thing we have
to worry about now is her.

216
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:29,791
The Beauty by the Lake.

217
00:10:29,875 --> 00:10:32,208
[ENDO] Ayame Shaga.

218
00:10:38,833 --> 00:10:40,041
[MALE VOICE 4A] Ben-To!

219
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:44,458
[SATO] Hello? What?
[SHAGA] You have to come quick!

220
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:48,166
Hurry! Or Mistress Shiraume
will find me!

221
00:10:48,583 --> 00:10:51,541
Mistress Shiraume?
Just perfect.

222
00:10:55,458 --> 00:10:57,625
[SHAGA] I'm over here!

223
00:10:59,958 --> 00:11:02,083
[SATO] Shaga?

224
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,583
[SHAGA] Took you long enough!

225
00:11:05,666 --> 00:11:08,583
Hey. What's
with the frilly dress?

226
00:11:08,666 --> 00:11:12,416
And you smell nice, like flowery
bath soap or something.

227
00:11:17,833 --> 00:11:19,125
[SHIRAUME] Just remember,

228
00:11:19,208 --> 00:11:21,375
I'm doing this for your own
good, do you understand?

229
00:11:21,458 --> 00:11:24,791
Besides, after what you did to
Oshiroi you deserve it.

230
00:11:25,416 --> 00:11:27,291
I did nothing wrong,
I was only trying to forge

231
00:11:27,375 --> 00:11:29,583
some bonds with a little
female contact, that's all.

232
00:11:29,666 --> 00:11:32,416
Yes, of course.
Here's an idea.

233
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,833
Why don't we forge
some bonds of our own?

234
00:11:37,375 --> 00:11:40,750
How about a little
female contact with me?

235
00:11:42,250 --> 00:11:43,958
Wow, that hurt.

236
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:46,250
Hey, hold on!
Wait!

237
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:49,583
My little Shaga.

238
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,541
Hey, let's
talk about this

239
00:11:52,625 --> 00:11:55,041
before we do anything
crazy. Okay?

240
00:11:56,375 --> 00:11:59,125
You can run but you
can't hide, my pretty.

241
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,500
Huh?

242
00:12:03,666 --> 00:12:05,833
I want you to trust me,
darling, I've done this a

243
00:12:05,916 --> 00:12:07,291
thousand times
so there's nothing

244
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:08,625
for you to be worried about.

245
00:12:08,708 --> 00:12:10,458
Yeah, right.

246
00:12:10,541 --> 00:12:12,833
How does this feel?

247
00:12:14,916 --> 00:12:16,583
[SHAGA] Get off me!

248
00:12:20,041 --> 00:12:22,583
[SHAGA] You expect
me to wear this thing?

249
00:12:22,666 --> 00:12:24,750
[SHIRAUME] Of course, I
think you'd look perfect in it.

250
00:12:24,833 --> 00:12:26,750
Here, let me help you put it on.

251
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,583
Well, I'd say
you're pretty lucky,

252
00:12:28,666 --> 00:12:30,000
you managed to get
away unscathed.

253
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:31,625
[SHAGA] I want to die.

254
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:34,833
Look, don't be silly.
It looks nice on ya.

255
00:12:34,916 --> 00:12:36,791
I'd think you'd be
more into fashion.

256
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:39,000
I mean, since you're
half-Italian and all.

257
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:42,000
I know you're just trying
to make me feel better.

258
00:12:43,583 --> 00:12:45,541
I have to distract
myself so I don't keep

259
00:12:45,625 --> 00:12:47,833
remembering the terrible
events that just transpired.

260
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:49,458
But how?

261
00:12:49,541 --> 00:12:51,666
Sato!
What time is it?

262
00:13:00,416 --> 00:13:01,958
So you showed up.

263
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,458
Does someone
wanna tell me

264
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:05,916
what's up with the dress?

265
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,166
It's kind of
a long story,

266
00:13:07,250 --> 00:13:08,750
it's better to just
leave it alone.

267
00:13:08,833 --> 00:13:10,083
That's fine by me.

268
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,500
I didn't really wanna
know anyway.

269
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:17,583
Tell me, Sato, which
bento are you going after?

270
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:20,833
[SATO] The Japanese
style tofu burger.

271
00:13:21,291 --> 00:13:23,333
[SHAGA] I thought, as a
general rule, members of the

272
00:13:23,416 --> 00:13:25,583
Half-Price Food Lovers club
don't go for the same dish?

273
00:13:25,666 --> 00:13:27,083
[SATO] Yeah, so?

274
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:29,458
Don't tell me that you're
gonna go after that one, too.

275
00:13:29,541 --> 00:13:30,958
No way.

276
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:33,541
You take it; I'll grab the
ginger fried pork bento instead.

277
00:13:34,750 --> 00:13:35,916
[SHAGA] What's wrong?

278
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,000
Are we going after the
same dish, Ice Witch?

279
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,166
[door opens]

280
00:13:39,250 --> 00:13:41,875
[SHAGA] So, that's
the Beefy God, huh?

281
00:13:42,583 --> 00:13:44,750
I see you did
your homework.

282
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:47,375
Yeah, I know a thing or
two about the shops in the west.

283
00:13:47,458 --> 00:13:48,500
So?

284
00:13:48,583 --> 00:13:49,750
[YARIZUI] Where do
you get your intel?

285
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:54,541
Listen up.

286
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,541
Yes, ma'am.

287
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,666
The number of
half-priced bentos

288
00:13:56,750 --> 00:13:59,083
to Wolves is
extremely low tonight.

289
00:13:59,166 --> 00:14:02,000
And these guys aren't
exactly pushovers either.

290
00:14:02,083 --> 00:14:03,625
So bring your 'A Game.'

291
00:14:03,708 --> 00:14:05,583
[SATO] Yeah.
I gotcha.

292
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:08,541
[SATO] Hey!

293
00:14:08,625 --> 00:14:10,708
What the heck do
you think you're doing?

294
00:14:14,291 --> 00:14:16,041
[NIKAIDO] Let's rock and roll.

295
00:14:19,166 --> 00:14:20,708
[SHAGA]
What's with the Ice Witch?

296
00:14:20,791 --> 00:14:22,750
She's a cold-hearted
Wolf, isn't she?

297
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,791
Definitely lives up
to her nom de guerre.

298
00:14:24,875 --> 00:14:26,000
[SATO] I guess so.

299
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,458
Just save yourself the
trouble and give up.

300
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,541
Oh please...

301
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,041
Your lame attempt
at cracking jokes

302
00:14:30,125 --> 00:14:32,333
is as pathetic as it ever was.

303
00:14:33,166 --> 00:14:35,958
Hey, that wasn't a joke.
Wait!

304
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,833
[SATO] Damn, I'm late!

305
00:14:58,208 --> 00:14:59,416
[YARIZUI] Bring it on.

306
00:15:17,666 --> 00:15:18,750
[SATO] Shaga!
Are you all right?

307
00:15:18,833 --> 00:15:20,916
I told you this was a bad idea!

308
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,125
[SHAGA] I'm perfectly fine.

309
00:15:23,208 --> 00:15:25,375
Haven't you ever heard the old
adage "whatever doesn't

310
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,250
kill you only makes you
stronger in the end"?

311
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:29,166
I would say that applies to her.

312
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:30,208
And I'd say you've

313
00:15:30,291 --> 00:15:31,958
completely lost
touch with reality.

314
00:15:32,041 --> 00:15:33,833
The Ice Witch may
have beaten me this time.

315
00:15:33,916 --> 00:15:36,458
But trust me, this isn't
even close to being over.

316
00:15:36,541 --> 00:15:39,750
From the harsh jaws of defeat,
I will snatch victory.

317
00:15:43,083 --> 00:15:45,166
Go get a bento and
give it to me afterwards,

318
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:47,708
then once you do,
you'll have your reward.

319
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,708
A big hug from me!

320
00:16:09,625 --> 00:16:11,708
[YARIZUI] You're pretty
good, but it's hard

321
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:14,333
to take you
seriously in that getup.

322
00:16:14,416 --> 00:16:17,125
Still, you're not nearly
good enough to beat me!

323
00:16:17,208 --> 00:16:18,250
Wait, what?

324
00:16:22,041 --> 00:16:24,625
[YARIZUI] We stand on a
battlefield for half-price food,

325
00:16:24,708 --> 00:16:26,166
but you're so focused.

326
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:28,208
you only have eyes for me.

327
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:30,750
[YARIZUI] You may be strong,
but if you don't keep the

328
00:16:30,833 --> 00:16:33,625
food in mind, then it's
just senseless violence.

329
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,333
You can't
win like that.

330
00:16:48,583 --> 00:16:51,708
You still have
a lot to learn, Beauty.

331
00:16:51,791 --> 00:16:54,541
Please understand
that I don't hate you.

332
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,041
[SATO] Shaga!

333
00:16:57,125 --> 00:16:59,166
[YARIZUI] Never give up.

334
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,666
[YARIZUI] To get what
you want, you have to

335
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,041
focus on what matters most.

336
00:17:04,125 --> 00:17:05,958
I have to focus
on what matters most.

337
00:17:06,041 --> 00:17:07,125
[stomach growls]

338
00:17:09,333 --> 00:17:11,416
Oh no, you don't!

339
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,708
I get what I want!

340
00:17:22,791 --> 00:17:25,416
[SATO THINKS] This guy
is nuts! He's so strong!

341
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,708
But I don't care.
Defeat is not an option!

342
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,375
[SATO] Spinach seasoned
with soy sauce,

343
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:32,000
served with veggies and rice.

344
00:17:32,083 --> 00:17:33,916
The vibrant colors
are bright enough to

345
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,208
rival the flowers of
a holiday wreath!

346
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:39,333
[SATO] Wait a sec!
Is that tofu burger handmade?

347
00:17:39,416 --> 00:17:41,041
You gotta be kiddin' me!

348
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:44,208
And are those maitake
mushrooms served in bean paste?

349
00:17:44,291 --> 00:17:45,333
Jackpot!

350
00:17:45,416 --> 00:17:48,166
I didn't even know
it had mushrooms!

351
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:50,416
That bento is all mine!

352
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,250
[FEMALE CLERK 4B] Thank
you, please come again!

353
00:18:24,333 --> 00:18:25,791
You got it, congratulations.

354
00:18:25,875 --> 00:18:27,541
[SATO] Yeah.
Sure did.

355
00:18:31,625 --> 00:18:33,000
[YARIZUI] Who was that guy?

356
00:18:33,083 --> 00:18:35,166
He's definitely not
from around here.

357
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,666
[SHAGA] Next time you
won't be so lucky, Ice Witch.

358
00:18:38,458 --> 00:18:39,750
[SATO] Shaga.

359
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:40,875
[YARIZUI] If you ever
wanna give it another shot,

360
00:18:40,958 --> 00:18:43,333
you know where you
can find me, Beauty.

361
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:46,458
C'mon Sato,
we should get going;

362
00:18:46,541 --> 00:18:48,458
I'm absolutely starved.

363
00:18:48,541 --> 00:18:51,416
Sorry Shaga, but I'm
gonna eat in the club room.

364
00:18:52,708 --> 00:18:55,833
[YARIZUI] You're welcome
to join us, if you want to.

365
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,250
[SHAGA] No, thanks.

366
00:19:00,458 --> 00:19:02,208
[SATO] Man, I wonder
what's wrong with her.

367
00:19:02,291 --> 00:19:04,750
[YARIZUI] You should probably
go eat with her, Sato.

368
00:19:04,833 --> 00:19:06,333
[SATO] Oh, whatever,
she'll be fine.

369
00:19:06,416 --> 00:19:08,791
I remember when we were little
kids and they'd give us animal

370
00:19:08,875 --> 00:19:11,041
crackers at school she would
always throw a huge fit

371
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:12,833
just like this whenever she
didn't get an elephant.

372
00:19:12,916 --> 00:19:14,333
[YARIZUI] Just go.

373
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:16,958
I can't stand guys who ignore
girls when they're hurting.

374
00:19:17,041 --> 00:19:19,416
She needs somebody
to talk to right now.

375
00:19:20,083 --> 00:19:21,375
Lemme ask you this,

376
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:23,291
if I was the one crying
and not her,

377
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,666
would you try to help me,

378
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:27,791
or would you stand there
doing nothing like a coward?

379
00:19:29,291 --> 00:19:31,083
[SATO] Good advice.

380
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:35,625
[ENDO] Interesting.

381
00:19:35,708 --> 00:19:37,875
In that case,
I think it's best we put the

382
00:19:37,958 --> 00:19:40,041
plan into action before
they make their move.

383
00:19:40,125 --> 00:19:41,666
[NIKAIDO] But,
it's possible that rivalry

384
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:43,250
might hurt us as well, boss.

385
00:19:43,333 --> 00:19:44,833
[ENDO] So what?

386
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:47,583
Why should I care about a bunch
of Wolves in sheep's clothing?

387
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:55,041
[SATO] Seriously.
Would you quit pouting, Shaga?

388
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,708
The truth is,
I'm ticked off at you,

389
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:01,125
but I'm also mad at myself.

390
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:04,333
Let's settle this now!

391
00:20:04,416 --> 00:20:06,833
Rock-paper-scissors
to determine who's responsible.

392
00:20:06,916 --> 00:20:08,625
Do we have a deal?

393
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,958
I'll take rock;
so do the right thing!

394
00:20:11,458 --> 00:20:13,125
[SHAGA] Okay, rock,
paper, scissors.

395
00:20:13,208 --> 00:20:14,291
Go!

396
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:20,333
[SATO] Sorry.

397
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:22,958
[SHAGA] Now say
it ten more times.

398
00:20:23,041 --> 00:20:25,041
[SATO] I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

399
00:20:25,125 --> 00:20:26,750
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

400
00:20:26,833 --> 00:20:28,000
How many do I have left?

401
00:20:28,083 --> 00:20:29,500
Twenty more to go.

402
00:20:29,583 --> 00:20:30,583
[SATO] The hell?

403
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,291
[SHAGA]
Shut up, moron.

404
00:20:32,625 --> 00:20:36,000
No! That was the best
bite in the whole box!

405
00:20:36,083 --> 00:20:38,125
It's delicious.

406
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,875
Oh, Sato.

407
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:46,500
I almost forgot to
give you your reward.

408
00:20:48,708 --> 00:20:49,833
Um, what are you doing?

409
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:51,250
Did you forget our deal?

410
00:20:51,333 --> 00:20:54,250
Your bento box in exchange
for a big hug, remember?

411
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:56,041
Yeah, I do.

412
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,291
[SHAGA]
This is a little awkward,

413
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,750
so why don't you hurry
up and get it over with?

414
00:20:59,833 --> 00:21:01,333
Come on.

415

how did we get like this?

00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:14,958
I just don't understand how
I ended up in the friend zone.

418
00:21:15,041 --> 00:21:18,375
[SATO] You're joking, right?
Let it go already.

419
00:21:19,250 --> 00:21:22,041
[SHAGA] Fine, I will.

420

[SHAGA] Sato, can I
tell you something?

421
00:21:27,916 --> 00:21:29,375
[SATO] Yeah, sure.

422
00:21:33,333 --> 00:21:34,416
[SHAGA] Never mind.

423
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:35,458
[SATO] What?

424
00:21:35,541 --> 00:21:36,750
[SHAGA] It's not important.

425
00:21:36,833 --> 00:21:38,500
[SATO] You have to tell me now.

426
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:40,625
[SHAGA] Just-- Just
forget about it, okay?

427
00:21:40,708 --> 00:21:42,750
[SATO] Ugh.
That is so not cool.
