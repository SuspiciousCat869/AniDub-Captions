[SATO VO] It was the
night of April sixth,

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:19,916
in the year twenty-eleven AD.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,333
That's when...
I died.

00:00:22,416 --> 00:00:25,416
[LITTLE BOY 1A] Hey Mama,
how come this guy isn't movin'?

7
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:31,500
I didn't miss it, did I?
The half-price bento.

[heels clapping on the ground]

00:00:38,875 --> 00:00:40,958
[SATO] What happened?

10
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:43,000
[opening song]

00:01:03,041 --> 00:01:05,000
[girl singing in Japanese]

12
00:02:12,958 --> 00:02:14,166
[SATO] Looking back,
I can't help but

13
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:15,916
question my purpose in life.

14
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,833
I came into this world
fifteen years ago and

15
00:02:17,916 --> 00:02:21,083
I've spent the last fourteen of
'em playing Sega games.

16
00:02:21,166 --> 00:02:23,000
[SATO] I had a normal childhood.

17
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:26,208
I mean, I've had my share of
screw ups, like any other kid.

18
00:02:26,291 --> 00:02:29,583
Like when I was little, I nearly
blew myself up at my dad's work,

19
00:02:29,666 --> 00:02:30,875
and I didn't know
you had to pay to

20
00:02:30,958 --> 00:02:33,083
get on the train until
a few years ago.

21
00:02:33,166 --> 00:02:35,666
Other than that, my
life's been pretty boring.

22
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,125
Especially compared to
my pal Ishioka from junior high.

23
00:02:39,208 --> 00:02:41,333
That guy's got enough
material for a primetime

24
00:02:41,416 --> 00:02:43,666
TV show that'd
sell millions of DVDs.

[stomach sound]

28
00:02:51,166 --> 00:02:53,000
[SATO] I guess you can't
die on an empty stomach

29
00:02:53,083 --> 00:02:54,708
or I'd be a goner.

30
00:02:55,083 --> 00:02:57,208
[crowd murmuring]

31
00:02:58,166 --> 00:03:01,750
[SATO] How did I get beat up at
the freakin' grocery store?

32
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,041
[Sato winces]

00:03:33,666 --> 00:03:35,208
Damn it.

35
00:03:38,833 --> 00:03:40,083
Perfect.

36
00:03:41,208 --> 00:03:42,666
Thank you.
Have a good evening, sir.

37
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,625
Yeah thanks, you too.

38
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:54,125
[SATO THINKS] I wonder
what she was she tryin' to say.

39
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:56,791
Was it....
"I love you"?

40
00:03:56,875 --> 00:03:58,750
Wait, she loves me?

41
00:03:58,833 --> 00:04:01,125
[YARIZUI] Hold me.

42
00:04:03,916 --> 00:04:05,125
I'm just
a high school kid;

43
00:04:05,208 --> 00:04:10,000
my feeble mind can't
handle that kinda fantasy!

44
00:04:11,583 --> 00:04:15,666

[Oshiroi whimpers]

46
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,083
[SATO] Believe it or not,

47
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,500
all that happened on
my first day of school.

48
00:04:35,833 --> 00:04:37,250
[SATO] It's the second
day of school and

49
00:04:37,333 --> 00:04:39,041
I'm walking there from the ER.

50
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:42,208
Man, I can't remember
a thing from last night.

51
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,500
[OSHIROI] Um, Saito?

52
00:04:46,625 --> 00:04:48,375
'scuse me, Saito?

53
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:52,458
[SATO] Who, me?
My name's actually Sato.

54
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:53,708
Yo Sato.

55
00:04:53,791 --> 00:04:55,666
[OSHIROI] Oh my goodness,
how embarrassing!

56
00:04:55,750 --> 00:04:57,833
Sorry about that!
Sato not Saito.

57
00:04:57,916 --> 00:05:00,416
I'm just so glad you're okay.
I was awfully worried about

58
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,750
you after the craziness
that went down last night.

59
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,750
[OSHIROI] Wow!
Look at all your bruises!

60
00:05:06,833 --> 00:05:07,791
I can't believe
you sprained your

61
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:09,166
left arm and your right ankle.

62
00:05:09,250 --> 00:05:11,250
That takes talent!
Did you break any bones?

63
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,416
Maybe a few ribs?

64
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:14,166
[SATO] Thankfully
I wasn't hurt that bad.

65
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,708
[OSHIROI] That's good, I guess.

66
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,500
Although I was kinda hoping
you broke out of the hospital.

67
00:05:17,583 --> 00:05:18,791
[SATO] The nurses were all like,

68
00:05:18,875 --> 00:05:21,458
"You should be
hospitalized, just to be safe."

69
00:05:21,541 --> 00:05:23,291
But when they called
my parents, my dad said,

70
00:05:23,375 --> 00:05:24,708
"If the boy can walk,

71
00:05:24,791 --> 00:05:28,333
then toss him out on his ass!"
and he hung up on them.

72
00:05:28,416 --> 00:05:29,791
[SATO] So in other words,

73
00:05:29,875 --> 00:05:33,416
"I ain't gonna pay the kid's
hospital fees!" Screw him.

74
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,375
I guess the nurses
let me stay overnight

75
00:05:35,458 --> 00:05:37,291
because they
took pity on me.

76
00:05:37,375 --> 00:05:38,666
You weren't admitted
but there's no

77
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:40,583
mistaking that you
were injured, right?

78
00:05:40,666 --> 00:05:41,833
I'll try to hold back.

79
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:43,458
[SATO] Okay.

80
00:05:43,541 --> 00:05:45,041
If only your injuries
were more visible,

81
00:05:45,125 --> 00:05:46,708
then I'd have a better idea of
your current physical condition.

82
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:48,750
I remember going to the
supermarket last night

83
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:50,958
'cause I was really hungry and I
was hoping they might have some

84
00:05:51,041 --> 00:05:53,541
half-price bento or somethin'
but I have no idea

85
00:05:53,625 --> 00:05:56,208
what happened once I got there.

86
00:05:57,083 --> 00:06:00,041
Are you telling me that you
don't remember anything at all?

87
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:02,083
Not even meeting me?

88
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,875
Uh.
You mean we've met before?

89
00:06:04,958 --> 00:06:05,875
Huh.

90
00:06:05,958 --> 00:06:07,458
[Oshiroi cries out
and then sobs]

91
00:06:07,541 --> 00:06:09,375
Oh, crap!
What've I done?

92
00:06:09,458 --> 00:06:11,416
What the hell is wrong
with you, Sato?

93
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:14,166
You just started high school and
you're already makin' girls cry?

94
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,125
Not cool, man!
So not cool!

95
00:06:16,208 --> 00:06:17,208
What's not to like?

96
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,958
[Sato stammers]

97
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:21,250
[OSHIROI] If you don't
remember meeting me,

98
00:06:21,333 --> 00:06:23,833
then that means you
must've lost your memory!

99
00:06:23,916 --> 00:06:26,875
You're a lonely man who's
abandoned his tortured past!

100
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:31,625
My creative juices
are flowin' now, Saito!

101
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,458
Hey, if you were at
the supermarket last night,

102
00:06:33,541 --> 00:06:34,958
then why dontcha be
a pal and fill me

103
00:06:35,041 --> 00:06:36,291
in on the details
about what happened--

104
00:06:36,375 --> 00:06:37,500
[OSHIROI] Oh, it was nothing!

105
00:06:37,583 --> 00:06:40,208
Don't worry your
pretty little head about it!

106
00:06:50,375 --> 00:06:54,000
[SATO] Hey.
She looks familiar.

107
00:06:54,083 --> 00:06:55,666
[SATO] Let me see.

108
00:06:55,750 --> 00:06:58,333
Where've I seen her before?

109
00:07:14,291 --> 00:07:16,458
Yeah, that's it!
I remember now!

110
00:07:16,541 --> 00:07:17,875
She was at the
supermarket, too,

111
00:07:17,958 --> 00:07:20,083
and she kept staring at me and
trying to say something.

112
00:07:20,166 --> 00:07:23,291
I think it's pretty obvious that
she's in love with me.

113
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:26,791
[SATO] Huh?
Where'd she go?

114
00:07:29,916 --> 00:07:32,166
Is that for me?

115
00:07:32,625 --> 00:07:35,833
Well, take it.
Don't just stand there, help me.

116
00:07:44,041 --> 00:07:46,041
[SATO THINKS] The red tie
means she's a sophomore.

117
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,583
Sweet, an older woman.

118
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:52,750
[SATO] So, uh, looks
like all this trash

119
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:54,666
is nothin' but
empty bento boxes.

120
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,958
Yeah, today's the day
for plastic recycling pick up.

121
00:07:59,625 --> 00:08:02,416
[SATO] I'm just surprised to see
so many of 'em, y'know?

122
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,916
[YARIZUI] That's because
our club forgot to take

123
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,750
out the trash before break,
and this is the first plastic

124
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,666
recycling pick up day we've
had since school started.

125
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,375
[SATO THINKS]
Geez, how many bento

126
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,583
do you go through in a day?

127
00:08:14,666 --> 00:08:15,875
[SATO] Can't you
throw out a little at a time

128
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:18,208
so it doesn't pile up like this?

129
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:20,250
Don't you understand how the

130
00:08:20,333 --> 00:08:23,208
waste system works in Japan?
Or have you been Americanized?

131
00:08:23,291 --> 00:08:25,833
Plastic recycling is
only collected once a week.

132
00:08:25,916 --> 00:08:28,458
Oh yeah,
believe me, I know.

133
00:08:30,916 --> 00:08:32,791
[YARIZUI] Unfortunately,
I'm the only one in

134
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:35,083
my club who ever
takes the trash out.

135
00:08:36,458 --> 00:08:39,541
[SATO] What kinda club are you
in anyway? You're the one who

136
00:08:39,625 --> 00:08:42,416
was staring at me from outside
the store yesterday, aren't you?

137
00:08:42,500 --> 00:08:44,916
[YARIZUI] Don't come to
the supermarket again.

138
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:48,250
[school bells chime]

139
00:08:48,333 --> 00:08:49,958
[MALE STUDENT 1A] Alright,
who's ready to chow down?

140
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:52,208
[FEMALE STUDENT 1A] So,
what do you wanna do for lunch?

141
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:54,166
[SATO THINKS] I left these
fish cakes in the hospital's

142
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:57,375
fridge overnight, but now
they're all warm and gross.

143
00:08:57,458 --> 00:09:00,083
Whatever, it's sustenance.

144
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:01,625
[SATO] I vaguely
remember buying them for

145
00:09:01,708 --> 00:09:04,625
dinner last night,
but that's about all I've got.

146
00:09:04,708 --> 00:09:08,041
Everything else is a
complete and total blank.

147
00:09:16,208 --> 00:09:18,583
[SATO] Um, hello?
Who are you?

148
00:09:18,666 --> 00:09:20,041
[SHIRAUME] My name is Shiraume.

149
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:23,000
[SATO] Hang on.
I know that name.

150
00:09:23,083 --> 00:09:24,250
Oh yeah!

151
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,791
[SATO] Yesterday,
our homeroom teacher said,

152
00:09:25,875 --> 00:09:27,875
"You need to elect a
class representative!"

153
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,416
which I thought was weird

154
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,833
'cause none of us really know
each other yet, but then--

155
00:09:30,916 --> 00:09:32,333
[SHIRAUME] I'll do it.

156
00:09:32,416 --> 00:09:33,875
[SATO] You volunteered
yourself and became

157
00:09:33,958 --> 00:09:36,166
our class representative
on the spot.

158
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:38,250
[SHIRAUME] It's very
nice to meet you all.

159
00:09:38,333 --> 00:09:40,375
Yeah, that's right.
You're Ume Shiraume!

160
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:41,791
[SHIRAUME] Indeed.

161
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:44,000
[SATO] No offense, but that's
kind of a weird name.

162
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:46,208
[SATO] When the teacher
wrote it on the board yesterday,

163
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,458
I thought, "That's Ume squared."

164
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,791
Ya mind
if I call you that?

165
00:09:50,875 --> 00:09:51,916
[SHIRAUME] Yes, I mind.

166
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,666
Stop fooling around
or I'll get angry.

167
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,000
[SATO] You're not now?

168
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,333
[SHIRAUME] If you
know what's good for you,

169
00:09:56,416 --> 00:09:58,000
you'll stay away
from Hana Oshiroi.

170
00:09:58,083 --> 00:09:59,250
[SATO] Oshiroi?

171
00:09:59,333 --> 00:10:00,375
[SHIRAUME] Don't play dumb.

172
00:10:00,458 --> 00:10:01,791
I know you were out
with her yesterday

173
00:10:01,875 --> 00:10:03,625
and you walked to school
together this morning.

174
00:10:03,708 --> 00:10:05,791
[SATO] This morning?
Oh!

175
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:08,208
That girl with the glasses who's
been following me around?

176
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:12,083
Hey, if you're so "in-the-know,"
then what did we do yesterday?

177
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:16,166
[SHIRAUME] I warned you,
don't make me angry.

178
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:17,500
[SATO] Huh?

179
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:20,166
[Sato cries out]

180
00:10:20,250 --> 00:10:22,333
[students ooh and ahh]

181
00:10:26,791 --> 00:10:28,166
[MALE STUDENT 1B] Hey, did
I miss somethin', Uchimoto?

182
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,541
[Uchimoto giggles]

183
00:10:30,291 --> 00:10:34,583
[school bells chime]

184
00:10:36,291 --> 00:10:38,333
[SATO] If I'd known
Karasuda Private High School

185
00:10:38,416 --> 00:10:39,583
had its own dorms,

186
00:10:39,666 --> 00:10:41,875
I would've thought twice
about transferring here.

187
00:10:41,958 --> 00:10:43,958
[SATO] Somehow
I just knew my old man

188
00:10:44,041 --> 00:10:46,708
would make me move
in to be closer to school.

189
00:10:47,083 --> 00:10:49,125
[SATO] The problem is
the dorm only serves breakfast,

190
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,125
so you're on your
own for lunch and dinner.

191
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:52,500
[SATO] I get that
they wanna teach

192
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:54,250
their students to
be independent,

193
00:10:54,333 --> 00:10:57,375
self-sufficient adults, but
living on your own seriously

194
00:10:57,458 --> 00:11:00,333
sucks when you don't know the
first thing about cooking.

195
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:02,833
[SATO] One month's allowance
is twenty-five-thousand yen,

196
00:11:02,916 --> 00:11:04,625
and subtracting other expenses,

197
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,583
I'm left with a
daily food budget of--

198
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,833
If I eat light at lunch,

199
00:11:07,916 --> 00:11:10,291
then I can stretch
my dinner budget to--

200
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:17,041
[YARIZUI] Don't come to
the supermarket again.

201
00:11:17,125 --> 00:11:18,916
I'm afraid I don't
have much of a choice.

202
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,041
I knew you'd
be here Sai--.

203
00:11:20,125 --> 00:11:21,250
I mean, Sato!

204
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:24,125
[OSHIROI] Don't mind me!
I'm just a fly on the wall!

205
00:11:24,208 --> 00:11:26,916
I simply couldn't resist the
lure of burning, manly passion!

206
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,708
[SATO] Uh.

207
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:35,875
[OSHIROI] Wait!

208
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:39,083
Sorry to spook ya.
But go this way.

209
00:11:58,166 --> 00:12:01,041
[YARIZUI] I told you
not to come here.

210
00:12:08,958 --> 00:12:10,333
[SATO] Whoa!
Check it out!

211
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:11,791
They're half-price!

212
00:12:11,875 --> 00:12:18,750
Tonight, I dine on bento!

213
00:12:35,416 --> 00:12:39,166
[BENTO BRAWLER 1A]
No. It's you. The Witch.

214
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:42,458
[SATO THINKS]
What's he talking about?

215
00:12:44,166 --> 00:12:47,333
[BENTO BRAWLER 1A]
You're the Ice Witch.

216
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:50,041
[SATO] But that's--

217
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:03,708
[SATO] Ben-To!

218
00:13:05,458 --> 00:13:07,041
[SATO] That's right.

219
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:11,500
[SATO] It's all coming
back to me now.

220
00:13:11,583 --> 00:13:13,333
[SATO] I was really
hungry last night,

221
00:13:13,416 --> 00:13:15,958
so I went to the store
to pick up some dinner.

222
00:13:16,708 --> 00:13:17,666
[OSHIROI] Oh my gosh!
I'm sorry!

223
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,083
[SATO] That's
where I met Oshiroi.

224
00:13:19,166 --> 00:13:21,583
I, uh--I touched you
with my filthy hands!

225
00:13:23,875 --> 00:13:25,625
[SATO] And then...

226
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:38,416
[SATO] It was game over.

227
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,875
[SATO] Aw, yeah!
Just a little higher!

228
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,708
All I need is one
little gust of wind!

229
00:13:46,791 --> 00:13:49,041
Almost there.

230
00:13:52,625 --> 00:13:55,083
Why the
heck am I all wet?

231
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:01,416
[ABURA] If ya got that much
energy, you must be fine.

232
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,416
Wait, where am I?

233
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,583
[ABURA] The Ho-Ki
Mart employee break room.

234
00:14:05,666 --> 00:14:08,541
Would ya mind walkin' your
friend home when she wakes up?

235
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:11,000
[ABURA] The store's already
closed up for the night.

236
00:14:11,083 --> 00:14:13,791
And the other guys
left a while ago.

237
00:14:13,875 --> 00:14:15,250
[SATO] Um, sir?

238
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:17,333
[SATO] What were all of
those people doin' here?

239
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:19,625
Nothin' special.
They're just the kind of folks

240
00:14:19,708 --> 00:14:21,583
who enjoy a little,
friendly competition.

241
00:14:21,666 --> 00:14:23,083
Over bento?

242
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:24,541
[ABURA] Now I don't want to
be rude, but I get the feelin'

243
00:14:24,625 --> 00:14:25,750
that you and
your friend here are

244
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,416
nothin' more than
a pair of lowly Dogs.

245
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,541
Dogs?

246
00:14:28,625 --> 00:14:30,083
[ABURA] This place
is a regular store,

247
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:31,166
and I'm just your

248
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:33,208
run-of-the-mill
supermarket employee.

249
00:14:33,291 --> 00:14:36,041
Most shoppers who come
in are picking up essentials,

250
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:39,916
but some of 'em come here
to test their skills in battle.

251
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,166
[ABURA] Sorry, kid, but you're
gonna have to step up your

252
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:45,333
game if you ever wanna get your
hands on a half-priced bento.

253
00:14:45,416 --> 00:14:46,625
If you ask me, you're better off

254
00:14:46,708 --> 00:14:49,791
buyin' one at full-price
like a good boy.

255
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:52,166
'Cause they'll
beat the shit outta you.

256
00:14:53,916 --> 00:14:56,833
[SATO] C'mon, it's just
a silly bento, right?

257
00:14:58,166 --> 00:14:59,708
[ABURA] You're lucky I'm
an employee 'cause

258
00:14:59,791 --> 00:15:02,041
that's the only
thing stoppin' me.

259
00:15:02,125 --> 00:15:03,916
A word of warning, kid.

260
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,916
If you call it
"a silly bento" in front

261
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,666
of the knights turned Wolves.

262
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:10,000
[ABURA] They'll kill you.

263
00:15:10,083 --> 00:15:12,416
[ABURA] This store is a
hunting ground for the Witch.

264
00:15:12,500 --> 00:15:13,250
[SATO] The Witch?

265
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:15,958
[ABURA] Yeah.
The Ice Witch.

266
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,000
[BENTO BRAWLER 1A]
You're the Ice Witch.

267
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:23,541
[ABURA] I feel bad that you
kids missed out on dinner,

268
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:26,083
so I left some protein bars
on the shelf for ya.

269
00:15:26,166 --> 00:15:27,291
When your friend wakes up,

270
00:15:27,375 --> 00:15:29,250
be sure to grab one
before you hit the road.

271
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,583
[ABURA] Oh, and here's
some tomato juice over

272
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,708
here if you'd rather
have that instead.

273
00:15:32,791 --> 00:15:34,166
Later.

274
00:15:45,958 --> 00:15:47,583
[guys react to power going out]

275
00:15:48,791 --> 00:15:49,833
[FEMALE STUDENT 1D]
I heard the power went out

276
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:51,208
at the boys'
dorm last night.

277
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:53,416
Yeah, some idiot decided
to microwave a

278
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:56,291
protein bar with the wrapper
on it and killed the breaker.

279
00:15:56,375 --> 00:15:57,500
[FEMALE STUDENT 1E] Seriously?

280
00:15:57,583 --> 00:16:01,000
He left the wrapper on?
Wow, what a dumbass!

281
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:07,250
[SHIRAUME] I demand to know
your relation to Hana Oshiroi.

282
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:08,791
[SATO] Well, uh.

283
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,583
I'm not really sure
how to answer that.

284
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:13,083
We're fellow
supermarket casualties?

285
00:16:13,166 --> 00:16:15,458
[SHIRAUME] You don't want
to make me angry, do you?

286
00:16:16,583 --> 00:16:18,875
[SATO] I get the
feeling you already are.

287
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,583
[SATO]

288
00:16:19,666 --> 00:16:20,875
[SHIRAUME] Yes.

289
00:16:20,958 --> 00:16:22,375
[Sato grunts from
getting hit several times]]

290
00:16:22,458 --> 00:16:24,375
[SHIRAUME] If you have no
intention of answering honestly,

291
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:27,041
I'll just have to ask
again later. 'Kay?

292
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,166
You must be crazy
to come here again tonight.

293
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:47,291
Maybe, but I guess
that makes you crazy, too.

294
00:16:48,625 --> 00:16:49,833
[SATO] Are you ready for this?

295
00:16:49,916 --> 00:16:51,416
[OSHIROI] Yeah, you bet!

296
00:17:05,125 --> 00:17:07,583
[OSHIROI] Oh, how I love
the smell of hunky men!

297
00:17:07,666 --> 00:17:09,208
[SATO THINKS]
I think I get it now.

298
00:17:09,291 --> 00:17:12,083
Last time, the bento I wanted
just happened to be half-price.

299
00:17:12,166 --> 00:17:14,458
It was nothin'
more than bad luck.

300
00:17:14,541 --> 00:17:15,708
When I made
a move for it,

301
00:17:15,791 --> 00:17:17,750
the whole supermarket
suddenly went insane.

302
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,583
I've never seen
anything like it.

303
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:22,458
It was like someone
ignited nitroglycerin.

304
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,625
[SATO] Hey!

305
00:17:24,708 --> 00:17:26,625
[OSHIROI] Oh, I'm okay;
he just startled me is all.

306
00:17:26,708 --> 00:17:29,125
I promise you I'm made
of stronger stuff than that!

307
00:17:29,666 --> 00:17:30,750
[OSHIROI] I'm so sorry!

308
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:32,875
Your hands have
been sullied by my DNA!

309
00:17:32,958 --> 00:17:36,000
[SATO] Geez, you really
are a germophobe, huh?

310
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:47,833
The Ice Witch is
here again tonight.

311
00:17:49,708 --> 00:17:50,916
[SATO] Which one's your target?

312
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:53,083
[OSHIROI] I want the
"This'll Make You Sweat!

313
00:17:53,166 --> 00:17:55,416
Feel the burn!
Super-Spicy Hamburger Bento!"

314
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,041
[SATO] Gotcha.
Then I'll go for the

315
00:17:57,125 --> 00:18:01,541
"Stick with It, Natto Okra Rice
Bowl with Cheese Topping Bento."

316
00:18:43,541 --> 00:18:44,375
[SATO] This is it!

317
00:18:44,458 --> 00:18:47,041
[crazed shouts]

318
00:18:47,541 --> 00:18:49,708
[SATO] Be careful!
Keep your head protected!

319
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,208
[SATO] Aw man,
I tried to tell ya--

320
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:56,708
[OSHIROI] They'll eat
you alive, Brunette!

321
00:18:56,791 --> 00:18:58,375
[SATO] Calm down!

322
00:19:02,750 --> 00:19:05,458
[SATO THINKS] Holy crap.
So these are the Wolves.

323
00:19:05,541 --> 00:19:07,625
I never would've
imagined putting a half-price

324
00:19:07,708 --> 00:19:12,125
sticker on a bento could turn
normal people into such savages.

325
00:19:13,166 --> 00:19:14,333
[OSHIROI] Get up!

326
00:19:14,416 --> 00:19:15,958
You gotta get back out
there and fight, Monk!

327
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,000
Damn, you're right!

328
00:19:18,583 --> 00:19:21,083
He listened to me!

329
00:19:34,416 --> 00:19:36,000
I've got
faith in you, Saito!

330
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:38,458
Don't die, but if
you do, don't you worry.

331
00:19:38,541 --> 00:19:41,250
I'll weep for
you at your funeral!

332
00:19:41,333 --> 00:19:44,583
[OSHIROI] Punch his lights
out! Look out behind you!

333
00:19:50,083 --> 00:19:51,458
[SATO] Crap!

334
00:19:52,541 --> 00:19:54,666
You should never
have come back here.

335
00:19:57,458 --> 00:19:58,916
Hey, watch out!

336
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:03,125
[BENTO BRAWLER 1O] It's her!

337
00:20:04,125 --> 00:20:06,541
[BENTO BRAWLER 1N]
It's the Ice Witch!

338
00:20:07,583 --> 00:20:09,416
What? You have
gotta be kiddin' me!

339
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:11,708
She's the Ice Witch?

340
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:14,500
Then what was she
trying to say to me that night?

341
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:16,541
[YARIZUI] You idiot.

342
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:37,041
[OSHIROI] Yeah!
Go for it, Saito!

343
00:20:44,958 --> 00:20:46,458
Bye.
Coming out tomorrow?

344
00:20:46,541 --> 00:20:47,916
You know it.

345
00:20:57,375 --> 00:20:59,541
[YARIZUI] Only the
strong dine on bento.

346
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,041
That is the rule
of this battlefield.

347
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,500
[SATO] But how'd you--?

348
00:21:04,583 --> 00:21:06,750
[YARIZUI] If you want
to learn to survive here,

349
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,708
then meet me in
clubroom five-oh-one

350
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:12,458
tomorrow morning
at seven-thirty sharp.

351
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:16,208
[OSHIROI] Yeah, that
was pretty fun, wasn't it?

352
00:21:16,291 --> 00:21:19,958
So, whaddya wanna do?
Go get something to eat?

353
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,458
[closing song]

354
00:22:20,541 --> 00:22:22,500
[girl singing in Japanese]

355
00:22:50,375 --> 00:22:54,083
[SATO] Clubroom five-oh-one.
Well, this is it.

356
00:22:54,166 --> 00:22:55,291
[YARIZUI] How's that feel?

357
00:22:55,375 --> 00:22:56,875
[OSHIROI] Um, a little lower.

358
00:22:56,958 --> 00:22:58,500
[YARIZUI] How about this?

359
00:22:58,583 --> 00:23:01,291
[Oshiroi excitedly moans]

360
00:23:01,375 --> 00:23:04,666
[OSHIROI] Oh, yes!
Yes! That's it right there!

361
00:23:12,958 --> 00:23:14,666
[YARIZUI] Perfect timing.

362
00:23:15,083 --> 00:23:17,458
Welcome to the Half-Priced
Food Lover's clubroom.

363
00:23:17,541 --> 00:23:22,041
I'm the club president and its
only member, Sen Yarizui.

364
00:23:22,125 --> 00:23:24,916
For now, I'll call you the
half-price-bento-seeking idiot.

365
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,791
Then I guess I should
call you the Ice Witch.

366
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,375
[YARIZUI] Whoa. How'd I get
stuck doing the preview?

367
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,125
It's not really my kinda thing.

368
00:23:40,208 --> 00:23:41,208
Whatever.

369
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:43,083
[YARIZUI] Bento Brawls
aren't just a hobby,

370
00:23:43,166 --> 00:23:44,416
they're a way of life.

371
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,291
You'll see.

372
00:23:45,375 --> 00:23:46,791
Next time.
