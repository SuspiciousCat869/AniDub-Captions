00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:29,041
We'll have to grab
you some sandals from

157
00:07:29,125 --> 00:07:31,000
the shoe lockers on the way out.

158
00:07:34,875 --> 00:07:36,791
Hey, is everything
okay, Shaga?

159
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:38,541
[SHAGA] Uh, yeah!

160
00:07:38,625 --> 00:07:41,458
It's just--Do you mind if
we go to a different store?

161
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,500
[SATO] How come?

162
00:07:42,583 --> 00:07:44,000
[SHAGA] I wanna shake it up.

163
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:45,708
I was just at Ralph's
a couple of days ago.

164
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,041
[SATO] Huh?

165
00:07:47,125 --> 00:07:48,708
But you were all about
goin' there when I showed

166
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:50,875
you that advertisement
Yarizui gave me.

167
00:07:51,291 --> 00:07:52,916
Wait a second,
where the heck did it go?

168
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,125
I just had it.

169
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,000
It listed all the
specials and everything.

170
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:56,625
This sucks!

171
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:58,666
Wow, what a dummy.

172
00:07:58,750 --> 00:08:00,208
[SHAGA] C'mon, let's go.

173
00:08:00,291 --> 00:08:02,750
[SATO] But what about Asebi?

174
00:08:02,833 --> 00:08:04,708
[SHAGA] You can wait if
you want to but it's gonna

175
00:08:04,791 --> 00:08:06,875
take her a little while
to get that coffee.

176
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:14,041
[ASEBI] What should I do?
It won't stop vending!

177
00:08:14,125 --> 00:08:16,791
And it hasn't given
me a single coffee!

178
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:19,666
[ASEBI] Wait, it's cola!

179
00:08:20,875 --> 00:08:24,500
I love cola!
It's so cold and fizzy!

180
00:08:24,583 --> 00:08:26,000
[SHAGA] See?

181
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,166
[ASEBI] All of a sudden
I'm feelin' a little chilly.

182
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:28,583
[SHAGA] The poor
girl's always got a cold,

183
00:08:28,666 --> 00:08:30,416
which is another good
reason to keep your distance.

184
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,375
[SATO] I wondered why
she was wearin' a scarf.

185
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:33,708
[SHAGA] Thankfully
she doesn't realize how

186
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,833
unlucky she is 'cause
she's an eternal optimist.

187
00:08:36,916 --> 00:08:37,833
[SECURITY GUARD]
Stop right there!

188
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,208
Crap, he found me!

189
00:08:39,291 --> 00:08:40,333
[SECURITY GUARD] You can
run all you want but there's

190
00:08:40,416 --> 00:08:42,333
no gettin' away from
me and my battery!

191
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:44,833
[SECURITY GUARD]
Bend over, ya little perv!

192
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,833
[SHAGA] Run away!
[SATO] Way ahead of ya!

193
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,333
[SHAGA] I'll distract the
geezer and his men;

194
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:49,625
you make a break for Ralph's!

195
00:08:49,708 --> 00:08:50,500
Meet ya there!

196
00:08:50,583 --> 00:08:52,041
[SATO] Got it!
[SHAGA] Hi!

197
00:09:11,416 --> 00:09:14,125
[SATO] Oh, hey.
I made it in time.

198
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:22,916
[LITTLE GIRL 5A]
Gimme! Meanie!

199
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,291
[LITTLE BOY 5A]
You can't have it!

200
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,041
Let me get your
change for you, sir.

201
00:09:26,125 --> 00:09:27,875
Thanks for shopping Ralph's.

202
00:09:29,208 --> 00:09:31,000
[SATO] About my outfit,
it's not what you think!

203
00:09:31,083 --> 00:09:32,500
[YARIZUI] I'm not
judging you, Sato.

204
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:35,041
If you wanna wear women's
clothing, that's fine with me.

205
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:36,833
No, I didn't have
anything else to wear--

206
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:37,666
it's a long story!

207
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,250
And I can't wait to hear it!

208
00:09:39,333 --> 00:09:42,125
[NIKAIDO] The man I was prepared
to call my rival is a pervert!

209
00:09:42,208 --> 00:09:43,208
How embarrassing.

210
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,875
Look, I think people
should be free

211
00:09:44,958 --> 00:09:46,875
to do as they please so
if it makes you happy--

212
00:09:46,958 --> 00:09:48,875
No way!
Please, let me explain myself--

213
00:09:48,958 --> 00:09:50,875
I knew you were pervy,
but this is crazy!

214
00:09:50,958 --> 00:09:52,041
If I called you cute,

215
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:53,541
is that an acceptable
compliment?

216
00:09:53,625 --> 00:09:54,541
None of this
would've happened

217
00:09:54,625 --> 00:09:55,666
if it weren't for Shaga!

218
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:57,916
Stop yelling,
you're causing a scene!

219
00:09:58,416 --> 00:10:02,833
I've got one thing to
say to you--Good job, Sato.

220
00:10:11,875 --> 00:10:13,041
[MALE VOICE 5A] Ben-To.

221
00:10:15,791 --> 00:10:17,208
[SATO] So hey.

222
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:18,625
The reason I'm
dressed like this--

223
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:20,583
[NIKAIDO] I don't
wanna hear your excuses.

224
00:10:20,666 --> 00:10:24,166
I don't have anything to say
to a lowlife perv like you.

225
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,000
I was a fool to think you'd be
worthy of a nom du guerre.

226
00:10:27,083 --> 00:10:29,500
If you'll just
let me explain to you.

227
00:10:30,333 --> 00:10:31,333
[NIKAIDO] Forget it!

228
00:10:31,416 --> 00:10:32,916
Have fun being crushed
by the Monarch!

229
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,291
[SATO] Huh?

230
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:41,291
[SATO] What's this?
He had the ad all along?

231
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:43,083
What the heck is
the "Monarch" anyway?

232
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,750
[YARIZUI] A dangerous Wolf.

233
00:10:44,833 --> 00:10:47,958
He's claimed a lot of
territory including this store.

234
00:10:48,041 --> 00:10:50,666
He's not afraid to play dirty
if that's what it takes to win.

235
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,875
That's why all the other
Wolves keep their distance.

236
00:10:52,958 --> 00:10:54,375
So do you think I
should be worried?

237
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,625
[SHAGA] You've got some nerve!
What're you doing here?

238
00:10:57,708 --> 00:10:59,750
You know this is
the Monarch's territory.

239
00:10:59,833 --> 00:11:01,166
You should've stayed out West

240
00:11:01,250 --> 00:11:02,541
where you belong
'cause he's gonna

241
00:11:02,625 --> 00:11:04,833
be super pissed off when
he finds out you came here.

242
00:11:04,916 --> 00:11:07,625
Oh, I have no intention
of taking him on.

243
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,458
However.

244
00:11:09,541 --> 00:11:11,041
[SATO]
"The Great Hokkaido Fair"?

245
00:11:11,125 --> 00:11:13,208
[YARIZUI] Yeah.
I picked it up this morning.

246
00:11:13,291 --> 00:11:15,333
"Unique bento made
from the freshest

247
00:11:15,416 --> 00:11:17,208
ingredients straight
from Hokkaido."

248
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,708
[OSHIROI]
They all look so yummy!

249
00:11:18,791 --> 00:11:21,625
[SATO] "Don't miss our
four-day fair starting Friday!"

250
00:11:21,708 --> 00:11:24,458
It sounds fantastic
but specialty items like those

251
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:27,166
are usually snatched up long
before they get discounted.

252
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,416
[Sato's phone rings]

253
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,166
[SATO] I'm sorry.
Lemme get this real quick.

254
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:33,416
Oh, hey Shaga.
Oshiroi's uniform?

255
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,791
[SATO] Sure, no problem.

256
00:11:34,875 --> 00:11:36,500
I'll swing by
and pick it up later.

257
00:11:36,583 --> 00:11:37,833
Oh, by the way.

258
00:11:37,916 --> 00:11:39,375
Uh, hold on.

259
00:11:39,458 --> 00:11:41,375
Hey, is it cool with
you if I take this with me?

260
00:11:41,458 --> 00:11:42,958
[YARIZUI] Sure, go ahead.
You can have it.

261
00:11:43,041 --> 00:11:45,500
[SATO] Awesome, thank you!
So do you know the Ralph Store

262
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,375
that's over in the
Eastern Territory?

263
00:11:47,458 --> 00:11:48,916
Yeah, of course
you've been there before.

264
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:50,708
Well, I was thinking
when I come by to pick up

265
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,833
the uniform we could head ov--

266
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,791
And with that, he was
gone, so I didn't even get

267
00:11:55,875 --> 00:11:57,541
the chance to tell him
about the Monarch.

268
00:11:57,625 --> 00:11:59,083
That's why I came
here to warn him.

269
00:11:59,166 --> 00:12:00,458
You did?

270
00:12:00,833 --> 00:12:02,583
[SATO THINKS]
She must really be into me!

271
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,708
I had no idea you
cared so much, Yarizui.

272
00:12:04,791 --> 00:12:06,875
Well yeah,
you're my friend,

273
00:12:06,958 --> 00:12:09,500
despite the fact it looks like
you're not really into girls,

274
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,541
which is a little
bit disappointing.

275
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,666
[YARIZUI] But, like I said,

276
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:13,791
if it makes you
happy I support you.

277
00:12:13,875 --> 00:12:15,541
I swear
I love the ladies!

278
00:12:15,625 --> 00:12:17,833
And not in the "I like to
dress as one" kinda way.

279
00:12:17,916 --> 00:12:20,375
Be proud of who
you really are, Sato!

280
00:12:21,125 --> 00:12:22,500
I suppose I should've
seen this coming.

281
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:23,958
I missed whatever
you just said.

282
00:12:24,041 --> 00:12:25,250
[SHAGA] Doesn't matter.

283
00:12:27,666 --> 00:12:29,208
I wonder what's
gotten into her.

284
00:12:29,291 --> 00:12:30,583
It's almost time.

285
00:12:30,666 --> 00:12:32,500
The God of Discounts
is making her move.

286
00:12:32,583 --> 00:12:35,583
[SATO] A woman?
And she's pretty young, too.

287
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:36,958
[YARIZUI] Her name's
Kiku Matsuba

288
00:12:37,041 --> 00:12:39,583
but she's known as Macchan.
She was a successful and

289
00:12:39,666 --> 00:12:41,583
well-known Wolf until
about a year ago.

290
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:44,666
And then she became
a God of Discounts?

291
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:51,458
[SATO] Oh, man.

292
00:12:51,541 --> 00:12:52,750
We're lucky there're
still a couple of

293
00:12:52,833 --> 00:12:55,375
bento leftover
from the Hokkaido Fair.

294
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,041
And a few regular ones, too.

295
00:12:58,125 --> 00:12:59,333
I think I'm
gonna go for the

296
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:01,416
Hokkaido Salmon
Fish soup tonight.

297
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,333
I'll have
the Eel Roe bento.

298
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,083
Um. Well,
in that case.

299
00:13:05,166 --> 00:13:07,916
I guess I'm gonna go for--
Oh, I don't know.

300
00:13:16,208 --> 00:13:17,041
Let's go!

301
00:13:17,125 --> 00:13:18,125
[SATO] Right!
[OSHIROI] Right!

302
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,250
[SATO] You're mine!

303
00:13:27,375 --> 00:13:28,500
[SATO] Shaga?

304
00:13:30,125 --> 00:13:31,333
[SHAGA] It's a real shame you
teamed up with the Ice Witch,

305
00:13:31,416 --> 00:13:34,375
because that makes you
my opponent, Sato!

306
00:13:34,458 --> 00:13:36,291
I've got you now!

307
00:13:48,916 --> 00:13:50,791
[YARIZUI] Bad news,
Beauty by the Lake.

308
00:13:50,875 --> 00:13:52,833
Sorry, but the battle's over.

309
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:56,500
I guess this
makes us even, then.

310
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,958
[YARIZUI] Well played, Beauty.

311
00:14:01,583 --> 00:14:03,041
Yeah, I got one!

312
00:14:06,833 --> 00:14:09,125
Who the hell
are all of you?

313
00:14:09,916 --> 00:14:12,041
I hate to break it to you,
but I can't let you

314
00:14:12,125 --> 00:14:14,333
get your hands on a
bento tonight, Pervert.

315
00:14:14,416 --> 00:14:15,208
But why?

316
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:17,166
'Cause we are Gabriel Ratchet.

317
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,000
A gang of brawlers who
faithfully serve the Monarch.

318
00:14:20,083 --> 00:14:22,500
And you guys think
you're gonna stop me?

319
00:14:23,416 --> 00:14:24,583
[YARIZUI] What's with them?

320
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:26,125
It's as if their
sole purpose is to

321
00:14:26,208 --> 00:14:28,458
keep Sato from getting a bento.

322
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:31,791
Oh no, don't tell me!

323
00:14:39,458 --> 00:14:41,291
Get outta there, Sato!

324
00:14:53,333 --> 00:14:54,875
[SATO] Who're you?

325
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,958
So you must be
the Ice Witch's new Dog.

326
00:14:58,041 --> 00:14:59,500
Leave him alone!

327
00:15:09,291 --> 00:15:11,250
He's gonna kill him.

328
00:15:12,791 --> 00:15:13,958
Your name
is gonna go down in

329
00:15:14,041 --> 00:15:16,791
history after tonight's
bento brawl, kid.

330
00:15:19,208 --> 00:15:21,250
You should be honored
that I chose you!

331
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:22,375
That's enough!

332
00:15:22,458 --> 00:15:24,416
[YARIZUI] Monarch!
You've already won.

333
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,833
So what are you trying to prove?

334
00:15:26,916 --> 00:15:28,166
If you didn't want
to start a war

335
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,791
between the East
and West Territories,

336
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:31,833
you shouldn't have brought
your Dog on my turf.

337
00:15:31,916 --> 00:15:32,875
Monarch!

338
00:15:32,958 --> 00:15:34,000
[ENDO] Think you
can stop me, Beauty?

339
00:15:34,083 --> 00:15:36,541
You're nothin' but
a useless mongrel.

340
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:41,291
[ENDO] Stand back and keep your
mouth shut like a good girl.

341
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:42,541
[ENDO] This is it, kid.

342
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,875
Your blood will signal
the start of the battle!

343
00:15:44,958 --> 00:15:46,500
We're about to
find out who's the

344
00:15:46,583 --> 00:15:49,166
strongest bento brawler of all!

345
00:16:00,375 --> 00:16:03,791
[SATO] The first thing I saw
when I finally came to was her.

346
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,208
[SATO] Whoa,
is she flirting with me?

347
00:16:08,291 --> 00:16:09,833
Did I get romantic
with this woman

348
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:12,208
and I don't even remember it?

349
00:16:12,291 --> 00:16:14,708
Oh, got your
mojo back?

350
00:16:14,791 --> 00:16:17,541
That was faster than I expected.

351
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,791
It was too fast for you.

352
00:16:22,875 --> 00:16:28,250
I'm so disappointed with myself,
but I am just a teenager y'know!

353
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,041
Um.
Can I ask you somethin'?

354
00:16:30,125 --> 00:16:30,958
[MATSUBA] Yeah, sure.

355
00:16:31,041 --> 00:16:32,333
[SATO] Uh.

356
00:16:32,416 --> 00:16:35,541
See, I don't really remember
anything, but ma'am...

357
00:16:35,625 --> 00:16:36,750
I want you to be
honest with me,

358
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:39,250
would you say that
I put up a good fight?

359
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:43,291
Honestly. I'm afraid
you came up short.

360
00:16:43,375 --> 00:16:45,750
But there's always
next time, right?

361
00:16:45,833 --> 00:16:47,041
[SATO] I'm such a loser!

362
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,916
I can't believe I don't
remember a thing!

363
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:50,250
And what's worse,

364
00:16:50,333 --> 00:16:53,166
my lack of experience left
her totally unsatisfied!

365
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:55,500
[SATO] She's got a ring on so
she must be a married woman.

366
00:16:55,583 --> 00:16:57,750
If her husband shows
up I'm a dead man.

367
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,791
Don't be such a coward!
You can't back down now!

368
00:16:59,875 --> 00:17:01,208
No way!

369
00:17:01,291 --> 00:17:03,208
[SATO] Who cares if
I finished too fast?

370
00:17:03,291 --> 00:17:04,583
I'm still full of energy!

371
00:17:04,666 --> 00:17:07,083
What I lack in quality I'll
make up for in quantity!

372
00:17:07,166 --> 00:17:10,083
This is it!
Time to stand erect my--

373
00:17:10,166 --> 00:17:11,875
Hey Sato, you awake?

374
00:17:11,958 --> 00:17:13,791
I'm so glad you
finally woke up.

375
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,875
I was getting worried
Shaga and I were gonna

376
00:17:15,958 --> 00:17:18,083
have to carry you
back to your dormitory.

377
00:17:18,166 --> 00:17:20,708
Is something wrong?
You look awfully pale.

378
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,875
What, did the Monarch's
attack leave you dazed?

379
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,208
Who is The Monarch again?

380
00:17:24,291 --> 00:17:26,708
It appears your
memory's been affected.

381
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:29,333
This is the break room
of the Ralph Store.

382
00:17:29,416 --> 00:17:31,333
The God of Discounts was
kind enough to let you

383
00:17:31,416 --> 00:17:34,125
rest here after the
Monarch defeated you.

384
00:17:34,208 --> 00:17:35,666
Oh.
I get it now.

385
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:37,625
[SHAGA] Here, we went and
picked up some clothes for you.

386
00:17:37,708 --> 00:17:39,500
Hurry and get dressed
so we can leave.

387
00:17:39,583 --> 00:17:41,041
Uh. I'm kinda modest
so would you

388
00:17:41,125 --> 00:17:43,041
mind leaving the
room while I change?

389
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,291
What's there
to be modest about?

390
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:46,125
You're already
down to your boxers.

391
00:17:46,208 --> 00:17:48,125
Now quit whining and
get dressed, would ya?

392
00:17:48,208 --> 00:17:49,166
Okay, listen up.

393
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,750
I'll shoot straight
with you ladies;

394
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,166
I can't really stand up right
now if you know what I mean.

395
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:55,250
Oh, was your
leg injured in the fight?

396
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:56,333
Let me see.

397
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:58,583
No, actually
my leg's okay.

398
00:18:00,666 --> 00:18:02,458
Wait just a minute.

399
00:18:02,541 --> 00:18:03,625
[SATO THINKS] Crap!
She figured it out!

400
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,500
[SHAGA] Uh-oh, Sato!
Someone got excited.

401
00:18:06,583 --> 00:18:09,083
I'll bet squeezing you like
this doesn't help, huh?

402
00:18:09,166 --> 00:18:10,791
What happened?
I don't understand.

403
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,625
Nothin' happened!
She's bein' silly.

404
00:18:12,708 --> 00:18:13,875
I get the feeling
you're trying

405
00:18:13,958 --> 00:18:15,416
to hide something from me.

406
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:18,625
[SATO] Really, it's nothing!
I'll be able to stand up soon.

407
00:18:18,708 --> 00:18:21,083
[SHAGA] Tell her part of
you is already standing.

408
00:18:21,958 --> 00:18:23,791
I bought coffee
filters like you asked

409
00:18:23,875 --> 00:18:25,583
but there were three
different kinds and I didn't

410
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:26,875
know which ones to buy,

411
00:18:26,958 --> 00:18:29,583
so I ended up getting
all three of 'em--

412
00:18:29,666 --> 00:18:31,833
Thanks, how much
do I owe you?

413
00:18:33,666 --> 00:18:35,208
[SATO] I'm sure this looks bad.

414
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:38,250
If I switch 'em all to men
I can use this in my novel.

415
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,958
I know it's not
much but I'm afraid

416
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:42,750
it's all that was left.

417
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,250
Thanks.

418
00:18:44,333 --> 00:18:45,791
I'm just grateful to have
something to eat tonight, ma'am.

419
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:46,958
I mean.

420
00:18:49,041 --> 00:18:50,166
Rub-a-dub-dub
thanks for the--

421
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,583
Before we
start eating dinner,

422
00:18:51,666 --> 00:18:54,541
Beauty, I have
something to ask you.

423
00:18:54,625 --> 00:18:55,625
What?

424
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,041
You've got connections
to the Monarch,

425
00:18:57,125 --> 00:18:58,583
do you know his plans?

426
00:18:58,958 --> 00:19:01,500
Oh, gimme a break,
like I'd ever tell you.

427
00:19:04,541 --> 00:19:06,041
All right, fine!
I'll tell you!

428
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:07,791
The Monarch's goal
is to eventually

429
00:19:07,875 --> 00:19:10,125
rule over all the
supermarkets in the city.

430
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,291
You've gotta
be kidding me.

431
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:13,333
"Operation Dominate the West."

432
00:19:13,416 --> 00:19:15,916
When the Hokkaido Fair ends
three short days from now,

433
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,291
a group of Wolves from
the Eastern Territory,

434
00:19:18,375 --> 00:19:19,791
led by Gabriel Ratchet,

435
00:19:19,875 --> 00:19:22,500
will launch an attack on
all the Western stores.

436
00:19:22,583 --> 00:19:23,708
According to the Monarch,

437
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:26,041
this plan is all about
settling an old grudge.

438
00:19:26,125 --> 00:19:27,166
No way.

439
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:28,666
[SATO] Did he say what happened?

440
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:30,583
[SHAGA] Nothing specific,
but he said something about

441
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:32,375
the strongest Wolf in
the East being defeated

442
00:19:32,458 --> 00:19:34,125
by a Wolf from the West.

443
00:19:34,208 --> 00:19:35,916
It must've happened a
while back but the Monarch

444
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,208
isn't about to let it go.

445
00:19:38,791 --> 00:19:39,833
Please don't be mad.

446
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,416
I meant to tell
you about it earlier

447
00:19:41,500 --> 00:19:43,875
but things have been
so crazy, you know?

448
00:19:44,416 --> 00:19:46,375
And I was kinda
scared to tell you

449
00:19:46,458 --> 00:19:47,875
because I could get in trouble.

450
00:19:47,958 --> 00:19:50,708
I just--sorry.

451
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,791
[SATO] How do you know all this?

452
00:19:51,875 --> 00:19:53,291
Are you helping
him execute his plan?

453
00:19:53,375 --> 00:19:56,166
Uh.
I can't tell you.

454
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,416
You brought Sato
here because you

455
00:19:57,500 --> 00:19:59,125
knew the Monarch
was waiting for him.

456
00:19:59,208 --> 00:20:00,875
You lured him into
a trap, didn't you?

457
00:20:00,958 --> 00:20:03,458
No! I didn't! I would never
do such a thing! Never!

458
00:20:03,541 --> 00:20:04,625
Then why
did you wait to tell

459
00:20:04,708 --> 00:20:06,875
us about this until the
very last second?

460
00:20:06,958 --> 00:20:08,958
I told you,
I was scared.

461
00:20:10,333 --> 00:20:11,125
'Cause Sato.

462
00:20:11,208 --> 00:20:12,291
Who? Me?

463
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:14,166
Are you really scared

Hey!

A mongrel.
