You must
be so angry with us.

00:00:12,083 --> 00:00:14,458
I know I'd be furious if
I was in your place.

[SAWAGI PRES]
I hope you want revenge,

'cause we really
wanna fight you again!

You come find us as
soon as you're ready, okay?

6
00:00:21,041 --> 00:00:22,041
[SAWAGI VP] Come and find us.

7
00:00:22,125 --> 00:00:24,041
Hunt us to the
ends of the earth.

8
00:00:24,125 --> 00:00:25,875
[SAWAGI PRES] If you dare.

00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:37,291
[NIKAIDO] Hang on.
I wanna ask--you something.

10
00:00:38,208 --> 00:00:41,625
Forget Orthros.
Who are you, really?

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:43,666
Well, my name
is Kyo Sawagi,

12
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,041
and this is my sister
who shares the same name.

13
00:00:46,125 --> 00:00:47,291
It may sound odd but

14
00:00:47,375 --> 00:00:48,625
they're written as two
different characters--

15
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:50,166
Why do you always have
to take things so literally?

16
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:52,958
It was a hypothetical question,
he didn't ask for our names.

17
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:54,500
Oh. Sorry.

18
00:00:54,583 --> 00:00:56,666
Where in the hell did
the two of you come from?

19

[SAWAGI PRES] Nice try buddy

our home address to some
skeevy dude we just met.

21
00:01:02,125 --> 00:01:03,916
[SAWAGI PRES] However,
since we told you to hunt us,

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I suppose it's only fair
that we let you know

23
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,958
which supermarkets
we're planning to hit next.

Would you please
cut it out, Sis?

31
00:02:57,208 --> 00:02:58,875
I know you're excited
about our victory,

but what are the
neighbors going to think?

00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:02,250
[SAWAGI PRES] How
you can be so calm?

34
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:04,500
We witnessed the
power of the Ice Witch!

35
00:03:04,583 --> 00:03:07,416
And, not only did we
totally overpower her,

36
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,500
but we also snatched her bento.

37
00:03:09,583 --> 00:03:11,416
It just feels so good!

38
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,541
Yeah.

39
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:14,583
It was pretty awesome.

00:03:14,666 --> 00:03:16,708
This is what we've always
dreamed about, Kyo.

41
00:03:16,791 --> 00:03:17,875
Remember?

42
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:19,333
Ever since you and
I were little kids we've

43
00:03:19,416 --> 00:03:21,958
known that we were
destined to be Wolves.

44
00:03:22,041 --> 00:03:25,291
Now, our dream has
finally become a reality.

[YOUNG SAWAGI PRES] Found you!

46
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,833
[SAWAGI PRES]
Back then, we had no idea

47
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,500
those brawlers
were called Wolves.

48
00:04:01,583 --> 00:04:03,500
I wonder when
we figured that out.

49
00:04:03,583 --> 00:04:06,041
[SAWAGI VP] It had to
be before we started school.

50
00:04:06,791 --> 00:04:08,333
[SAWAGI VP] When our
kindergarten teacher asked us

51
00:04:08,416 --> 00:04:09,875
what we wanted to be when
we grew up, we answered:

52
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,625
[BOTH] When we're
all grown up we wanna be Wolves!

53
00:04:14,541 --> 00:04:16,666
Yeah. We'd already
made up our minds.

54
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,083
Uh-huh.

55
00:04:18,166 --> 00:04:21,791
We knew from the start,
we wanted to be noble Wolves.

56
00:04:23,041 --> 00:04:24,541
Noble.

Whoa, where did
all this come from?

59
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:32,916
There was nothing noble
about what I did last night!

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,083
I'm sorry,
but I couldn't help myself;

61
00:04:35,166 --> 00:04:37,208
I said something really
mean to the Pervert!

62
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:38,416
What did you say to him?

63
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,708
"Hey Perv, it doesn't
look like there's an

64

wimpy body of yours!

Next time you're gonna be a
big, red puddle on the floor!"

I probably shouldn't say that to

strangling them.

Hey Kyo, are you sure that
wasn't just a bad dream?

69
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:54,291
Oh. Now that you mention it,
I guess it was.

70
00:04:54,375 --> 00:04:55,958
But still, what if he decides he

71
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:57,583
doesn't want to fight
us anymore?

00:04:57,666 --> 00:04:59,583
If that happens, what're
we gonna do, Kyo?

73
00:04:59,666 --> 00:05:01,791
I don't think we have
any reason to worry.

If it'll make you feel better,

No, I didn't.

[OSHIROI] That's too bad 'cause
I did awesome on my novel!

thing really inspired me.

wrote itself, y'know?

Orthros are strong,
but I never would've

97
00:05:50,791 --> 00:05:52,750
thought they were strong
enough to beat Yarizui.

98
00:05:52,833 --> 00:05:54,208
I had to start writing
the old fashioned way

99
00:05:54,291 --> 00:05:56,666
with paper and pen because
my laptop exploded but it

100
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,458
makes me feel
more like a real writer;

and everything!

stop them by myself.

Huh? Do you
know why?

[BRUNETTE] Maybe
she's gone into hiding?

117
00:06:37,708 --> 00:06:40,250
After all, that was
a harsh way to lose.

118

To be honest,
I've been toying with

the idea of skipping
tonight's brawl myself.

No, you can't
give up now!

worry, okay?

Uh. Hey,
it's me, Yarizui.

00:08:26,250 --> 00:08:28,500
Oh, yeah. Sorry.

you at a bad time,

156
00:08:30,375 --> 00:08:32,041
but I was worried about you.

157
00:08:32,125 --> 00:08:33,833
So I came by.

158
00:08:38,458 --> 00:08:40,666
[SATO THINKS] She's not dressed.

159
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:44,958
[YARIZUI] Why are you
staring at me like that?

160
00:08:45,041 --> 00:08:47,500
Oh, uh-- I'm sorry.

161
00:08:47,583 --> 00:08:49,250
I don't look
that bad, do I?

162
00:08:49,333 --> 00:08:50,875
Because you're getting
me all worried now.

163
00:08:50,958 --> 00:08:53,875
Oh, no. Uh. You
look just fine to me.

164
00:08:53,958 --> 00:08:55,833
I dropped in outta the blue so
if this isn't a good time-- 

165
00:08:55,916 --> 00:08:56,791
[YARIZUI] Come in.

166
00:08:56,875 --> 00:08:57,958
Wait, but are you sure?

167
00:08:58,041 --> 00:08:59,458
[YARIZUI] Of course, I'm sure.

168
00:08:59,541 --> 00:09:02,875
I already had a slight cold
but it got worse overnight.

169
00:09:02,958 --> 00:09:05,291
I woke up feeling
absolutely horrible.

170
00:09:05,375 --> 00:09:07,583
I've been lying
in bed all day long.

171
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,416
Huh?

172
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:12,750
[YARIZUI] Yeah,
I'm sorry I forgot call you.

173
00:09:12,833 --> 00:09:15,125
I didn't mean to make you worry.

174
00:09:24,125 --> 00:09:25,750
[SATO THINKS] Oh, I get it now.

175
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,000
Everything okay?

176
00:09:27,083 --> 00:09:29,458
Uh, yeah, sorry!

177
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:32,000
I thought you might be sick,
so I brought these for you.

178
00:09:32,083 --> 00:09:34,416
That's so sweet.
Thank you.

179
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:45,041
[SATO] It's covered
in her sweat!

180
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:48,250
It was on her forehead until
just a few seconds ago!

181
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:54,083
Hey Sato?

182
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:57,083
Do you mind checking to see
if my fever's gone down?

183
00:09:57,166 --> 00:09:58,583
No prob.

184
00:10:04,125 --> 00:10:06,875
I'm afraid you're
still warm, Yarizui.

185
00:10:06,958 --> 00:10:10,000
I'm sorry, but would you
please stay with me tonight?

186
00:10:10,083 --> 00:10:11,583
Don't apologize.

187
00:10:11,666 --> 00:10:14,291
I'd be happy to stay with you
and share some coffee.

188
00:10:14,375 --> 00:10:17,083
[YARIZUI] Do you mind
if I have a bottle of Pocari?

189
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:20,916
[SATO] Not at all!
Go right ahead!

190
00:10:22,583 --> 00:10:25,500
The cold feels
good on my skin.

191
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:29,666
Oh!

192
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,166
I guess you've still got
a bit of a fever, huh?

193
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,333
Yeah, guess so,

194
00:10:32,416 --> 00:10:34,708
but I'm sure it'll
go down eventually.

195
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,416
Look, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

196
00:10:40,833 --> 00:10:42,416
[SATO] It was all my fault.

197
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,416
I never should've
let my guard down.

198
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,708
No, it wasn't
your fault.

199
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:49,375
I simply wasn't strong
enough to take them on.

200
00:10:49,458 --> 00:10:52,333
Next time,
we're gonna win for sure.

201
00:10:52,666 --> 00:10:54,375
Yarizui.

202
00:10:54,458 --> 00:10:57,083
Yeah, I agree. Once you
start feeling better,

203
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,083
we can give it
another shot, okay?

204
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,333
[YARIZUI]
The day after tomorrow.

205
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,541
We have to.

206
00:11:01,625 --> 00:11:03,208
Summer will be over
soon, and that means--

207
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,625
That means
that this might be

208
00:11:04,708 --> 00:11:06,416
our last chance
to get an eel bento!

209
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,041
Yeah, exactly.

210
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:10,958
[YARIZUI] The Super Audrey
has an eel special

211
00:11:11,041 --> 00:11:13,833
every year and
it's absolutely amazing.

212
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:18,125
[YARIZUI] Delicious freshwater
eel grilled over charcoals.

213
00:11:18,208 --> 00:11:20,333
They cook a new
batch each hour and the

214
00:11:20,416 --> 00:11:23,583
customers only
purchase the fresh ones.

215
00:11:23,666 --> 00:11:25,083
Now listen.

216
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,083
That night, when the
God of Discounts gets to work,

217
00:11:29,166 --> 00:11:31,041
all of the eel bento
boxes are marked

218
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,416
half-price regardless of
when they were made.

219
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:36,250
You're tellin' me we can
get fresh eel for half-price?

220
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,208
[YARIZUI] I've got to
get my hands on one.

221
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:41,625
So do me a favor, if you happen
to run into the twins tonight,

222
00:11:41,708 --> 00:11:45,083
will you tell them to meet
me at Super Audrey?

223
00:11:45,833 --> 00:11:49,666
The eel bento
is gonna be all mine!

224
00:11:55,958 --> 00:11:57,333
[BRUNETTE] Ben-To.

225
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:00,541
[GIRL STUDENT 11F]
Hey, whatever happened with

226
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,166
that guy who texted you?

227
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,166
[GIRL STUDENT 11H]
Oh, I blew him off.

228
00:12:03,250 --> 00:12:05,000
He turned out to
be a total creep.

229
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:06,375
[SPORTS TEAM GUY 11A]
Karasuda High!

230
00:12:06,458 --> 00:12:08,000
Fight! Fight!
[WALLA: SPORTS TEAM] On! On!

231
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:10,125
[SPORTS TEAM GUY 11A]
Karasuda High!

232
00:12:10,208 --> 00:12:12,250
Fight! Fight!
[WALLA: SPORTS TEAM] On! On!

233
00:12:33,458 --> 00:12:35,291
[SATO] Orthros asked
you to invite me?

234
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,166
[NIKAIDO] More like
they forced me to.

235
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,458
[SATO] But what could they
possibly want with me?

236
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:40,958
[SAWAGI PRES] Uh, Pervert?

237
00:12:49,583 --> 00:12:50,916
I'm--

238
00:12:51,791 --> 00:12:53,375
[SAWAGI PRES] I'm--

239
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:55,416
[SATO] I get the
feeling she's trying to say,

240
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,458
"I'm gonna strangle you, Perv!"

241
00:12:57,541 --> 00:12:58,750
I'm--
I'm sorry about all

242
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,958
the terrible things
I said the other day.

243
00:13:01,041 --> 00:13:03,083
Please, forgive me!

244
00:13:05,333 --> 00:13:08,500
Thank you, but you
didn't say anything that bad.

245
00:13:10,458 --> 00:13:12,166
Do you mind if
we take a timeout?

246
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,625
Sure, go right ahead.

247
00:13:15,666 --> 00:13:17,000
[SAWAGI VP] I told you
that was just a dream.

248
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,416
Now what are we gonna do?

249
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:19,541
[SAWAGI PRES] I know, I
should've listened to you, Sis.

250
00:13:19,625 --> 00:13:21,166
[SATO] Those two have
some serious issues.

251
00:13:21,250 --> 00:13:23,583
[NIKAIDO] No joke. Tell
me something I don't know.

252
00:13:23,666 --> 00:13:26,166
[BENTO BRAWLER 11B] Check it out
guys, Orthros are here again.

253
00:13:27,791 --> 00:13:30,375
Well, I guess there's no
reason to stick around.

254
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:33,291
They're scared of us, Kyo!

255
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:35,791
Look at them
trying to sneak out!

256
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:37,083
Please excuse my sister's

257
00:13:37,166 --> 00:13:39,583
rude behavior; she can be
extremely competitive.

258
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,666
What's so rude about it?

259
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:44,041
I simply think that losers
need to know their place.

260
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:49,166
I mean, look at the two of you;
you're like--You're like--

261
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:53,791
They're like a couple
of dumb dogs, right?

262
00:13:53,875 --> 00:13:55,375
Yeah!
Way to go!

263
00:13:55,458 --> 00:13:57,083
You guys are just two dumb dogs

264
00:13:57,166 --> 00:13:58,541
who aren't even
worthy of our time!

265
00:13:58,625 --> 00:14:00,208
And you're gonna
be begging us for mercy

266
00:14:00,291 --> 00:14:02,875
when we wipe this filthy
floor with your faces!

267
00:14:02,958 --> 00:14:05,291
"Filthy?" Don't you think
that's kind of insulting

268
00:14:05,375 --> 00:14:06,916
to the people
who work here, Sis?

269
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,875
Uh. You're gonna
beg for mercy when

270
00:14:08,958 --> 00:14:10,041
we wipe this clean
and shiny floor wi--

271
00:14:10,125 --> 00:14:11,166
That's too much;

272
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,833
now it sounds like
you're mocking them.

273
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:18,708
We're done playing
your little games, ladies.

274
00:14:18,791 --> 00:14:20,208
We're gonna
beat you tonight.

275
00:14:20,291 --> 00:14:21,375
Oh, you think so?

276
00:14:21,458 --> 00:14:22,750
Well, good luck but
we're not gonna be

277
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:25,583
defeated by a couple
of dumb dogs.

278
00:14:36,916 --> 00:14:38,166
[SHAGA] I see.

279
00:14:38,250 --> 00:14:40,083
So they beat the crap
outta you guys again, huh?

280
00:14:40,166 --> 00:14:42,166
You are two dumb dogs.

281
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:43,166
Thanks, Shaga.

282
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,541
Enough about us, okay?

283
00:14:44,625 --> 00:14:46,500
Did you get the info
I asked you for or not?

284
00:14:46,583 --> 00:14:48,208
[SHAGA] Didn't your mother
teach you any manners?

285
00:14:48,291 --> 00:14:50,083
Girls don't like pushy guys.

286
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,541
[NIKAIDO]
Just answer me, would ya?

287
00:14:51,625 --> 00:14:53,083
[SHAGA] Okay, okay.

288
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:54,875
I'll give you your
info but only because

289
00:14:54,958 --> 00:14:57,416
I'm a kind,
generous person, jerk.

290
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:59,791
[SHAGA] Have you ever
heard of the Sonic Store?

291
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:01,541
No, doesn't ring a bell.

292
00:15:01,625 --> 00:15:03,833
[SHAGA] It first sprung
up not too far from here,

293
00:15:03,916 --> 00:15:07,291
in Yumehiro, but it was so
popular that it became a chain.

294
00:15:07,375 --> 00:15:08,791
But get this,

295
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:11,791
the company that operates
it is the Sawagi Corporation.

296
00:15:11,875 --> 00:15:12,875
[SATO] Wait a second.

297
00:15:12,958 --> 00:15:14,916
Are you trying to
say that Orthros--

298
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:17,500
[SHAGA] Yep, they're the
daughters of the owner.

299
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,250
They used to live in Yumehiro,

300
00:15:19,333 --> 00:15:21,541
and they moved here
about three years ago.

301
00:15:21,625 --> 00:15:23,083
That's interesting.

302
00:15:23,166 --> 00:15:25,375
Happen to know if they were
Wolves before they moved away?

303
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,583
From what I've heard,
they were active Wolves

304
00:15:27,666 --> 00:15:31,083
in Yumehiro, but they stopped
brawling when they came here.

305
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:34,041
It sounds like they ran into
some trouble back home.

306
00:15:35,625 --> 00:15:36,875
[NIKAIDO] I'll see ya later.

307
00:15:36,958 --> 00:15:38,875
I'm gonna go to
Yumehiro to investigate.

308
00:15:38,958 --> 00:15:41,000
Okay, drive safely!

309
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:46,833
So, do you wanna
play some Virtua?

310
00:15:46,916 --> 00:15:48,041
Alright,
but while I'm here

311
00:15:48,125 --> 00:15:49,750
I really gotta find Orthros.

312
00:15:49,833 --> 00:15:53,208
Yarizui said to tell them
about the eel bento--

313
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,291
Oh yeah!

314
00:15:57,375 --> 00:15:59,333
Super Audrey's eel bento
special is coming up!

315
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:00,708
I'm looking forward to it, too.

316
00:16:00,791 --> 00:16:02,333
[SATO] I was supposed to
tell them to show up there,

317
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,250
but I'm gonna have
to leave the job to you!

318
00:16:04,333 --> 00:16:05,750
[SHAGA] Huh? Why
do I have to do it?

319
00:16:05,833 --> 00:16:07,833
Tell 'em Yarizui will
be waiting for them there.

320
00:16:07,916 --> 00:16:08,666
See ya!

321
00:16:08,750 --> 00:16:10,125
Wait!
Hold on, Sato!

322
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,083
What the hell is wrong with you?

323
00:16:14,875 --> 00:16:16,833
Oh man, this sucks.

324
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:31,625
[SHAGA] Come to the Super Audrey

325
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:34,791
tomorrow night for
half-price eel bento.

326
00:16:35,791 --> 00:16:39,125
The Ice Witch wants you to
know she'll be waiting for you.

327
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,291
Oh, we wouldn't
miss it for the world.

328
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:43,041
Please tell her
thanks for extending

329
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,458
such a generous invitation.

330
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,250
[SAWAGI PRES] I assume
you'll be there, too.

331
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,041
See you tomorrow.

332
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:53,250
[SAWAGI PRES]
I'm so excited, Kyo!

333
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,625
Aren't you?

334
00:16:54,708 --> 00:16:56,500
We get a chance to brawl
against the Ice Witch again!

335
00:16:56,583 --> 00:16:58,416
[SAWAGI VP] Yes.
It's all very exciting.

336
00:16:58,500 --> 00:16:59,916
I know.

337
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:04,166
[SAWAGI VP] Oh no,
it's a Dog Day.

338
00:17:04,250 --> 00:17:06,166
Just like three years ago.

339
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,833
Yeah, I almost forgot.

340
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:10,958
It was a Dog Day.
This can't be good.

341
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,208
[SATO] What do you
mean you've gotten worse?

342
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,375
How in the heck did that happen?

343
00:17:17,166 --> 00:17:19,375
[YARIZUI] I told you
not to visit me today.

344
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,708
Well, too bad!

345
00:17:20,791 --> 00:17:22,583
Now tell me how you've
gotten even sicker!

346
00:17:22,666 --> 00:17:24,000
[YARIZUI] All right, fine.

347
00:17:24,083 --> 00:17:25,500
I thought it would
be a good idea

348
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,375
to prepare myself for battle.

349
00:17:27,458 --> 00:17:28,708
Okay.

350
00:17:28,791 --> 00:17:30,791
[YARIZUI] So last night,
I decided to take a really

351
00:17:30,875 --> 00:17:33,000
hot bath thinking that
it would kill the virus.

352
00:17:33,083 --> 00:17:34,458
Okay.

353
00:17:34,541 --> 00:17:36,666
[YARIZUI] When I got out,
my skin was burning up,

354
00:17:36,750 --> 00:17:39,458
so I put on my PJs and
sat in front of the AC.

355
00:17:39,541 --> 00:17:40,708
Okay.

356
00:17:40,791 --> 00:17:42,958
[YARIZUI] And it felt
so good I fell asleep.

357
00:17:43,041 --> 00:17:44,166
[SATO] I wanna be mad,

358
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:46,458
but that sounds like
something I would do.

359
00:17:46,791 --> 00:17:48,500
[SATO] Maybe you should
forget about the Super Audrey--

360
00:17:48,583 --> 00:17:51,291
No way! I can't let
a cold get me down!

361
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:53,166
[SATO] But you can't fight
anyone in your current state.

362
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,666
Are you
giving up on me?

363
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,833
I'll show you.

364
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,750
I want you to go to
the pharmacy for me.

365
00:17:57,833 --> 00:18:00,416
I just need some cold
medicine and I'll be fine.

366
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:01,833
[SATO] Are you sure about that?

367
00:18:01,916 --> 00:18:03,250
The bento brawl
is tomorrow night.

368
00:18:03,333 --> 00:18:04,375
I know!

369
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,333
I'll be fine, Sato!

370
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:10,416
[YARIZUI] Please.
Do this for me.

371
00:18:11,625 --> 00:18:13,833
[SATO THINKS]
She sounds terrible...

372
00:18:16,250 --> 00:18:19,125
I've gotta do whatever
I can to help her out.

373
00:18:22,916 --> 00:18:24,291
[FEMALE CLERK 11A]
Good evening, sir!

374
00:18:32,875 --> 00:18:34,833
[NIKAIDO] Have you
ever heard of Orthros?

375
00:18:35,750 --> 00:18:37,166
Sorry, but I don't
believe I've had the

376
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:39,291
pleasure of meeting
you before, Wolf.

377
00:18:39,375 --> 00:18:41,416
Now who told you to
come here and talk to me?

378
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,750
A lovely lady
who was once

379
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,833
known as The Monarch Butterfly.

380
00:18:44,916 --> 00:18:46,000
Matsuba.

381
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:47,541
Please give her my
best regards, will you?

382
00:18:47,625 --> 00:18:48,791
Of course I will, that is,

383
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:50,791
if you tell me what
happened three years ago.

384
00:18:50,875 --> 00:18:52,916
I've already tried asking
some of the other Wolves

385
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,375
but they just ignore me
and refuse to answer.

386
00:18:55,458 --> 00:18:57,125
I called her out of desperation

387
00:18:57,208 --> 00:18:59,083
and she said you'd
be able to help me.

388
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,333
[GLASSES MAN 11A] I'm afraid
I can't tell you anything.

389
00:19:01,416 --> 00:19:03,416
As you know, every town
has its own set of rules.

390
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,291
The last thing I want
to do is break them,

391
00:19:05,375 --> 00:19:07,666
'cause I'd have to
give up being a Wolf.

392
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,083
Although, I suppose
there wouldn't be any

393
00:19:11,166 --> 00:19:14,041
harm in helping someone who
knows one of my old friends.

394
00:19:14,125 --> 00:19:15,458
[GLASSES MAN 11A]
All right fine,

395
00:19:15,541 --> 00:19:17,541
I'll tell you because I'm
feeling charitable today.

396
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,375
[GLASSES MAN 11A]
Back then, there was a

397
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,666
pair of Wolves who took
on an odd name.

398
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:24,291
That of a two-headed dog from
ancient Greek Mythology.

399
00:19:24,375 --> 00:19:27,291
However, they were
soon driven out of town.

400
00:19:27,375 --> 00:19:29,833
By a Wolf called
Heracles' Combo.

401
00:19:29,916 --> 00:19:32,416
Wait, seriously?
But why?

402
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,208

Look how scared they are!

That's what you get, brats!

You're not so tough now.

You girls are goin' down!

406
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:42,708
[SAWAGI PRES] Why?
Why are you doing this?

407
00:19:44,958 --> 00:19:47,125
Stop it!
Go away!

408
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:48,708
What did we ever do to you?

409
00:19:48,791 --> 00:19:50,750
[SAWAGI VP] Kyo!
Kyo, wake up!

410
00:19:51,958 --> 00:19:53,416
[SAWAGI VP] You okay?

411
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,708
It sounds like you had a bad
dream about that day again, huh?

412
00:19:57,541 --> 00:19:59,333
[SAWAGI VP] This is
getting out of hand, Sis.

413
00:19:59,416 --> 00:20:00,791
Maybe we should call it off.

414
00:20:00,875 --> 00:20:03,791
No way.
We've gotta fight.

415
00:20:03,875 --> 00:20:07,458
We can't let the Ice Witch and
those dumb dogs win that easily.

416
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,916
[SAWAGI PRES] It's not going
to be like last time, okay?

417
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,500
I promise.

418
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:15,500
[GLASSES MAN 11A] It didn't
take long for news of Orthros'

419
00:20:15,583 --> 00:20:17,791
return to reach us
here in Yumehiro.

420
00:20:17,875 --> 00:20:19,708
My first thought was,
"There's a Dog Day

421
00:20:19,791 --> 00:20:22,166
coming up, this is just
like three years ago."

422
00:20:22,250 --> 00:20:23,208
I have no doubt.

423
00:20:23,291 --> 00:20:25,750
Heracles' Combo will show up.

424
00:20:25,833 --> 00:20:28,875
You've got to find a way
to save them somehow.

425
00:20:42,458 --> 00:20:47,291
[HERACLES] It's time to drive
you away again, Orthros.

426

In that case,

429
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:24,625
this suppository
should do the trick.

430
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:25,875
But you have to be careful;

431
00:22:25,958 --> 00:22:28,000
some people don't like
taking suppositories.

432

[SATO THINKS] I can't blame 'em.

Who wants to stick
medicine up their butt?

to put it in by
themselves the first time.

438

Which brawler will take home the
coveted half-price eel bento?

Next time:
