[FEMALE STUDENT 3A]
So how did everything go?

00:00:11,125 --> 00:00:12,333
[FEMALE STUDENT 3B] Not so good.

I found an awesome

[ALL GIRLS]
Good morning, Coach Dandou!

00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,541
[YAMAHARA]
Hey, did you guys hear?

9
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:28,333
[KENDO CLUB A]  'Bout what?
You mean, the streaker who ran

10
00:00:28,416 --> 00:00:30,583
around campus and then
jumped into the incinerator?

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:32,000
I heard that.

12
00:00:32,083 --> 00:00:33,125
[KENDO CLUB B] I betcha
he was a hippy who was tryin'

13
00:00:33,208 --> 00:00:34,875
to protest the burning of trash.

14
00:00:34,958 --> 00:00:37,083
[KENDO CLUB A] Nah man, they
just tie themselves to stuff.

15
00:00:37,166 --> 00:00:38,166
[KENDO CLUB C] Hold up!

16
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:39,375
Do you think it
could've been an alien?

17
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:40,541
[KENDO CLUB D]
Get a life, dumbass!

18
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:41,416
What I heard was-- 

19
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:42,625
[KENDO CLUB E] Um, excuse me?

20
00:00:42,708 --> 00:00:44,833
[KENDO CLUB F] Yeah?
What is it, Freshman?

21
00:00:44,916 --> 00:00:46,791
[KENDO CLUB E] I heard
someone threw a school uniform

22
00:00:46,875 --> 00:00:48,458
out the window and
the student council,

23
00:00:48,541 --> 00:00:49,666
who were out collecting trash,

24
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:51,625
added it to the pile
they were gonna burn.

25
00:00:51,708 --> 00:00:53,458
Apparently, the guy
who'd lost his uniform

26
00:00:53,541 --> 00:00:57,375
jumped into the
incinerator to get it back.

27
00:00:57,458 --> 00:00:59,000
[KENDO CLUB ALL]
Yeah, right.

00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:47,541
[SHIRAUME]
Would you mind telling me

32
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,041
where your
cell phone is, Sato?

33
00:02:49,125 --> 00:02:50,958
Huh?
My phone?

34
00:02:51,041 --> 00:02:52,125
Uh, but why?

35
00:02:52,208 --> 00:02:53,625
[SHIRAUME] Tell me
where it is right now or

36
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:55,125
I'll be forced to
search you for it.

37
00:02:55,208 --> 00:02:57,041
Seriously?
Wait!

38
00:02:57,125 --> 00:02:58,625
Yeah, I remember
where it is now!

39
00:02:58,708 --> 00:03:00,291
I left it in my dorm room!

40
00:03:00,375 --> 00:03:03,833
[SATO] I'm telling the truth!
Tell her I'm not lying!

41
00:03:04,375 --> 00:03:06,958
[SATO] Hey! Don't just
turn your backs on me!

And you are?
Aw, crap.

No, that's not it.

Uchi.

00:03:17,916 --> 00:03:20,416
Hey, thanks, I really
owe ya one, buddy.

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,208
My advice to you is just
enjoy what's about to happen.

48
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,041
I know I would.

49
00:03:25,125 --> 00:03:26,250
[SATO] Huh?

50
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:37,916
[Sato screams]

51
00:03:40,208 --> 00:03:42,375
[YARIZUI] You're telling me
she did this to you because

52
00:03:42,458 --> 00:03:44,416
you wouldn't give
her your cell phone?

53
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:46,166
Yeah, she totally
embarrassed me

54
00:03:46,250 --> 00:03:47,875
in front of the whole class.

55
00:03:47,958 --> 00:03:50,250
When she pulled
my uniform off me,

56
00:03:50,333 --> 00:03:52,833
the zipper on my pants ripped.

57
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:56,958
Well, in that case.
Take 'em off.

58
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,333
C'mon, let's go.
I don't have all day.

59
00:04:00,416 --> 00:04:03,875
[SATO] But this is
all so sudden.

60
00:04:03,958 --> 00:04:05,833
I mean, it's just
that I've never

61
00:04:05,916 --> 00:04:07,291
done it before, y'know?

62
00:04:07,375 --> 00:04:09,250
I'm just fixing
your zipper, perv.

63
00:04:09,333 --> 00:04:10,750
[SATO] I knew that.

64
00:04:12,083 --> 00:04:13,625
[YARIZUI] I might
as well fix the top

65
00:04:13,708 --> 00:04:15,375
button on your
shirt while I'm at it.

66
00:04:15,458 --> 00:04:16,916
Take that off, too.

67
00:04:29,916 --> 00:04:31,958
Geez, would you
quit staring at me like that?

68
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:33,708
Who, me?
I wasn't staring, I swear!

69
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:36,166
[YARIZUI] Of the different
types of half-price bento,

70
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:38,250
sushi are the
hardest to find.

71
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:39,541
And why's that?

72
00:04:39,625 --> 00:04:41,125
[YARIZUI] I'm sure you're
aware sushi bentos are

73
00:04:41,208 --> 00:04:43,250
the most expensive
at the supermarket.

74
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,000
Even at half-price,
they're still pretty costly.

75
00:04:46,083 --> 00:04:48,000
And they tend to go bad faster.

76
00:04:48,083 --> 00:04:49,625
They're also very
popular so

77
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:51,166
they sell-out before
the end of the day.

78
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,291
[SATO] What do you mean "only"?
I don't want you takin' any!

[OSHIROI] Just a
couple for research?

00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Hey Sato,
are you even listening?

81
00:04:57,083 --> 00:04:58,833
[SATO] Uh.
Not really.

82
00:04:58,916 --> 00:05:01,166
I'm sorry. Would you
mind if we talked about

83
00:05:01,250 --> 00:05:03,541
all this once I got my
clothes back on?

84
00:05:03,625 --> 00:05:06,416
Sorry but I'm feelin'
a little overexposed.

85
00:05:07,375 --> 00:05:09,416
[SATO] No, my uniform!
What the hell?

86
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,250
[YARIZUI] Now that your uniform
isn't around to distract you,

87
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:15,541
what do you say we continue
our conversation, Sato?

88
00:05:15,625 --> 00:05:17,625
Wait, what was I
talking about again?

89
00:05:17,708 --> 00:05:18,958
Oh yeah sushi.

90
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:20,708
So it's basically a meal
that consists of mostly--

91
00:05:20,791 --> 00:05:21,958
I know what sushi is!

Nice boxers, perv.

94
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:35,750
This is all your fault.

00:05:35,833 --> 00:05:38,375
You should've just
handed over your phone.

96
00:05:39,291 --> 00:05:40,625
[SHIRAUME]
I apologize for jumping

97
00:05:40,708 --> 00:05:42,375
to conclusions last night.

98
00:05:42,458 --> 00:05:43,916
Oshiroi explained
everything and

99
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,333
it all makes perfect
sense to me now.

100
00:05:47,458 --> 00:05:49,958
I don't understand why
anyone would fight over food.

101
00:05:50,041 --> 00:05:52,458
However, I am thrilled to
know that these battles

102
00:05:52,541 --> 00:05:54,666
are giving Oshiroi
inspiration for her novel.

103
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:56,375
Wait, you're writing
about the brawls?

104
00:05:56,458 --> 00:05:57,041
That's cool.

105
00:05:57,125 --> 00:05:58,250
Well.

106
00:05:58,333 --> 00:05:59,583
[SHIRAUME]
Sorry if I was rude but

107
00:05:59,666 --> 00:06:01,791
I'm concerned about
Oshiroi's well-being.

108
00:06:01,875 --> 00:06:04,375
Promise me you won't
push her too hard.

109
00:06:04,458 --> 00:06:07,333
[YARIZUI] I have no intention
of pressuring anyone.

110
00:06:08,791 --> 00:06:11,083
[SHIRAUME] Well,
in that case, she can stay.

111
00:06:11,625 --> 00:06:12,708
[SHIRAUME] Before I go,

112
00:06:12,791 --> 00:06:14,250
I have a message
from the student council.

113
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,708
[SATO] Are you a member?

114
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,916
[SHIRAUME] Would I deliver a
message for them if I wasn't?

115
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,083
[SATO] But we
just had the election.

116
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:21,625
I thought the results
weren't supposed

117
00:06:21,708 --> 00:06:22,500
to be announced
until this weekend.

118
00:06:22,583 --> 00:06:23,875
I assure you, I will be a

119
00:06:23,958 --> 00:06:25,541
member of the student council.

120
00:06:25,625 --> 00:06:29,166
I have ways of making
sure I always get what I want.

121

Oshiroi's applications for the

And now that you have the
minimum of three members,

124
00:06:36,083 --> 00:06:37,583

will be added to

[YARIZUI] Thank you.

127
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:42,541
[SHIRAUME] Very well then,
if you'll please excuse me.

Trash-collection?

Each day,
the student council

00:06:47,166 --> 00:06:48,958
collects trash around campus.

132
00:06:49,041 --> 00:06:50,333
[SHIRAUME]
Then we dispose of it in

the most efficient way possible.

134
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:53,791
We burn it.

[STUDENT COUNCIL GIRL 3A]
Hey, wait!

141
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:16,208
[YAMAHARA] C'mon.

142
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,666
Do you think I give a crap
about some dumbass

who jumped into an incinerator?

144
00:07:19,875 --> 00:07:21,125
I heard that the
Ice Witch has been

145
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:24,125
lookin' for new Dogs,
and she found two.

They're freshmen students
Yo Sato and Hana Oshiroi.

147
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:31,500
They're both pretty weak
but they've got potential,

148
00:07:31,583 --> 00:07:33,083
so I was thinkin' about asking

'em if they wanna join up with
us before they get too strong.

Here's a question for ya.

00:07:38,291 --> 00:07:39,958
[DANDOU]
What makes 'em so special?

153
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:41,875
[YAMAHARA] I dunno, but if
the Ice Witch has her eye

154
00:07:41,958 --> 00:07:44,208
on two Dogs, there's
gotta be something.

155
00:07:44,291 --> 00:07:46,833
[DANDOU] So they've got the
same ranking as you boys?

156

[YAMAHARA] Basically, yes,
but there's one defining

00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,041
characteristic that
makes us different.

158
00:07:51,125 --> 00:07:53,166
We're Hunting Dogs.

159
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:56,916
[YAMAHARA] We aren't scavengers,
we hunt, Coach Dandou.

160
00:07:58,291 --> 00:08:00,291
[OSHIROI] You jumped head-first
into an incinerator and

161
00:08:00,375 --> 00:08:02,625
you've only got five little
burns and three scratches.

162
00:08:02,708 --> 00:08:04,208
Talk about amazing!

163
00:08:04,291 --> 00:08:06,208
I know I'm lucky
I made it out alive but I

164
00:08:06,291 --> 00:08:08,041
feel like I got
run over by a truck.

165
00:08:08,125 --> 00:08:09,625
If you're
not feeling good,

166
00:08:09,708 --> 00:08:11,166
maybe we should
skip the bento brawl.

167
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:14,458
Nah, I still wanna go.
I could use something to eat.

168
00:08:16,875 --> 00:08:20,041
Hey, Sato. Do you
mind if I come with you?

169
00:08:20,125 --> 00:08:22,041
You never
asked me before.

170
00:08:22,125 --> 00:08:24,333
Sure, okay, we can go together.

171
00:08:24,416 --> 00:08:25,916
"Go together"?

172
00:08:27,958 --> 00:08:29,750
I'm so using that!

173
00:08:33,166 --> 00:08:36,208
[YAMAHARA] Whassup,
Sato? Hey, Oshiroi.

174
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,500
[OSHIROI AND SATO] Coach Dandou
and the Hunting Dog Unit?

175
00:08:40,583 --> 00:08:42,333
Isn't he the guy
with the perma-scowl

176
00:08:42,416 --> 00:08:43,833
who also teaches Japanese?

177
00:08:43,916 --> 00:08:45,791
[YAMAHARA] Yeah, but he
won't be joining us tonight.

178
00:08:45,875 --> 00:08:47,416
He stopped by this
hole-in-the-wall place

179
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:51,041
called Hiro-chan's for some
miso ramen and fried rice.

180
00:08:51,125 --> 00:08:52,541
[YAMAHARA] That's all
the poor guy can afford

181
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:55,625
on his measly teacher's salary.

182
00:08:55,708 --> 00:08:57,541
Anyway,
my name's Yamahara.

183
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,750
I'm the captain of the
Kendo club and I'm also

184
00:08:59,833 --> 00:09:01,125
the leader of the Hunting Dogs.

185
00:09:01,208 --> 00:09:02,166
[SATO] Oh, yeah?
[OSHIROI] Hello.

186
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,458
It's hard to believe
you guys have

187
00:09:03,541 --> 00:09:05,416
only been doin' this
for two weeks now. Crazy.

188
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,750
You're really good at it, too,

189
00:09:06,833 --> 00:09:08,750
but I guess that's to be
expected when an awesome

190
00:09:08,833 --> 00:09:11,541
brawler like the Ice Witch
is your teacher, huh?

191
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,500
Let me get straight
to the point.

192
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,833
How'd you like to join
the Hunting Dog Unit?

193
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:18,250
[YAMAHARA] I mean,
no pressure or anything.

194
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:20,333
We're not doing
too bad ourselves,

195
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:22,041
but we could use more people.

196
00:09:22,125 --> 00:09:23,333
You don't have
to answer right away.

197
00:09:23,416 --> 00:09:25,166
Why don't you just hang
out with us for a while

198
00:09:25,250 --> 00:09:26,375
and see how it goes?

199
00:09:26,458 --> 00:09:28,458
I can guarantee you a bento.

200
00:09:28,541 --> 00:09:29,458
[SATO] Really?

201
00:09:29,541 --> 00:09:30,791
[Sato's stomach makes noise]

202
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,500
Sure, we can
give it a try.

203
00:09:33,583 --> 00:09:34,458
Yeah, sounds like fun!

204
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,250
Sweet!
Glad to have ya!

205
00:09:36,916 --> 00:09:39,166
[YAMAHARA] You'll see eight
other guys wearing one of these.

206
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:41,833
They're your allies, the members
of the Hunting Dog Unit.

207
00:09:41,916 --> 00:09:42,958
Okay.

208
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:49,208
[YAMAHARA] Whatever
you do, stick to the plan.

209
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:52,000
It sounds crazy but,
trust me, it'll work.

210
00:09:52,083 --> 00:09:53,583
All you've gotta do
is follow our lead,

211
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:56,625
and you'll go home
with a warm bento tonight.

212
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:04,458
[SATO] Damn, he's fast!

213
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,083
[SATO] It's the
Hunting Dog Unit!

214
00:10:13,041 --> 00:10:14,958
Okay, follow me!

215
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,833
[YAMAHARA] Let's go!

216
00:10:22,541 --> 00:10:24,166
Wow, that was easy!

217
00:10:24,250 --> 00:10:27,958
[OSHIROI] This is the first
time I've actually gotten one!

218
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:34,291
Can't you see they've
got bento in their hands?

219
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:36,625
Now back off, losers.

220
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,166
[KENDO CLUB A]
That was easier than last time!

221
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:40,625
[KENDO CLUB D] I didn't
expect it to go so well

222
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,083
with two newbs taggin' along!

223
00:10:42,166 --> 00:10:43,083
[KENDO CLUB B] Yeah, no kiddin'!

224
00:10:43,166 --> 00:10:44,875
[OSHIROI] Is something wrong?

225
00:10:44,958 --> 00:10:46,500
No. No,
it's nothing.

226
00:10:46,583 --> 00:10:48,791
[SATO AND OSHIROI]
Thank you for the food!

227
00:10:55,041 --> 00:10:58,125
Wow, it's delicious, huh?

228
00:10:58,208 --> 00:10:59,541
[YAMAHARA] What's up, Sato?

229
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,458
You're thinkin' about switching
teams now, aren't ya?

230
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:04,250
[SATO] Well, I dunno.
[OSHIROI] "Switching teams"?

231
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,125
It must be a pretty
tough decision for ya.

232
00:11:06,208 --> 00:11:08,833
We may not be Wolves like
the Ice Witch but as you saw,

233
00:11:08,916 --> 00:11:10,916
we can easily get
our hands on bento,

234
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,166
as long as we work together.

235
00:11:19,708 --> 00:11:22,166
I'm sorry but
would ya mind if

236
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,375
I thought it over
a little longer?

237
00:11:24,791 --> 00:11:25,958
Meet us tomorrow night.

238
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:28,500
We'll be at the same
place at the same time.

239
00:11:28,583 --> 00:11:30,541
Until then,
hold on to the jersey.

240
00:11:30,625 --> 00:11:32,500
It's a good fit on you.

241
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:40,000
[UCHIMOTO] Ben-To!

242
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:42,458
[KENDO CLUB A] I hate to say it

243
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:43,791
but I ain't so sure about
the newbs, Captain.

244
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:45,125
[KENDO CLUB F] Yeah, me too.

245
00:11:45,208 --> 00:11:46,666
They don't seem like
they wanna join up with us.

246
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:48,416
[YAMAHARA] They may
not now but they will.

247
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,416
They're not gonna be
able to resist the urge of

248
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:53,041
getting their hands on
a bento every night.

249
00:11:53,125 --> 00:11:55,166
The fact that they're
undecided means we've still

250
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:57,750
got a good chance of
winning 'em over.

251
00:11:58,541 --> 00:12:00,875
[YARIZUI] Dandou and
the Hunting Dog Unit?

252
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:02,208
Why'd you go with those guys?

253
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:04,125
When we went to
the supermarket their leader

254
00:12:04,208 --> 00:12:06,166
asked us if we wanted
to join up with them.

255
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,291
[YARIZUI] And?

256
00:12:07,375 --> 00:12:09,750
[SATO] I told 'em
we'd think about it.

257
00:12:09,833 --> 00:12:11,000
[SATO] They work
together in a way that

258
00:12:11,083 --> 00:12:12,708
makes it super easy
to get bento but--

259
00:12:12,791 --> 00:12:14,875
[OSHIROI ] This is the first
time I've ever gotten one!

260
00:12:14,958 --> 00:12:16,833
[YARIZUI] Congratulations.

261
00:12:16,916 --> 00:12:19,000
[SATO] I was really lookin'
forward to eating mine

262
00:12:19,083 --> 00:12:20,750
but it didn't taste
all that great.

263
00:12:20,833 --> 00:12:21,750
[YARIZUI]
Which one did you get?

264
00:12:21,833 --> 00:12:23,000
The large Cheese Pork

265
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:24,583
Cutlet Curry Rice
bento from Tokiwa.

266
00:12:24,666 --> 00:12:26,750
[YARIZUI] Come on, that's
one of their specialties.

267
00:12:26,833 --> 00:12:28,666
There's no way it tasted bad.

268
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:30,458
They must've
missed the mark today.

269
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:31,583
It was just "meh."

270
00:12:31,666 --> 00:12:33,416
[YARIZUI] Seriously?

271
00:12:34,833 --> 00:12:35,833
[YARIZUI]
Oh, I get it now.

272
00:12:35,916 --> 00:12:37,791
You get what?

273
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,708
[YARIZUI] Nothing.
Don't worry about it.

274
00:12:39,791 --> 00:12:43,125
[SATO] Aw, c'mon,
don't leave me hangin'.

275
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:44,916
[YARIZUI] I remember
back when this club was

276
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,500
first started the
president once said.

277
00:12:47,583 --> 00:12:50,375
"You may like bento now,
but wait until you've

278
00:12:50,458 --> 00:12:53,458
tasted one that you've
earned at half-price."

279
00:12:54,291 --> 00:12:55,875
[YARIZUI] Think about
that the next time you dig

280
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:59,833
into a bento and you'll
understand what I'm getting at.

281
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,416
[YARIZUI]
Thanks for the meal.

282
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:24,250
And just what do
you think you're doing?

283
00:13:24,333 --> 00:13:25,708
You've already eaten.

284
00:13:25,791 --> 00:13:27,541
[SATO] Just a little bite?
[YARIZUI] Not gonna happen.

285
00:13:34,333 --> 00:13:36,833
[YARIZUI] Fine,
but you guys owe me.

286
00:13:38,708 --> 00:13:40,875
Okay, ladies first.

287
00:13:41,416 --> 00:13:42,916
Wait, you don't
want me eating

288
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:43,958
from your chopsticks,
do you?

289
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,458
I have no
problem with it.

290
00:13:45,541 --> 00:13:46,666
What, are you worried that I'm

291
00:13:46,750 --> 00:13:47,750
gonna give you
cooties or something?

292
00:13:47,833 --> 00:13:51,208
No! I'm sure
you're cootie-free!

293
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:56,083
It's so yummy!

294
00:13:58,833 --> 00:14:00,750
"Ah,"

295
00:14:07,416 --> 00:14:11,708
That's tasty!
Thanks for lettin' me try it.

296
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:20,333
[OSHIROI] So what's up?

297
00:14:20,416 --> 00:14:21,958
I can tell something's
bothering you.

298
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:24,875
[SATO] Listen, I was just
wondering if you'd wanna--

299
00:14:24,958 --> 00:14:28,833
well, if you'd
wanna do it with me.

300
00:14:30,958 --> 00:14:32,208
Wow. Uh.

301
00:14:32,291 --> 00:14:34,500
I really don't know how to
respond to that, Sato.

302
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:35,875
That didn't come out right!

303
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,375
Uh.

304
00:14:37,458 --> 00:14:39,166
I mean, it's not like I'm
not interested in you at all.

305
00:14:39,583 --> 00:14:43,250
It's just--You're
a cool guy, but I want

306
00:14:43,333 --> 00:14:46,166
my first time to be, well,
special, you know?

307
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:47,625
With someone I love.

308
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:49,958
But you can hold my
hand if you want to.

309
00:14:50,541 --> 00:14:52,708
I meant do you wanna join
the Hunting Dog Unit with me?

310
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,916
Wait, what?

311
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,375
But I thought you asked
if I wanted to "do it"

312
00:14:55,458 --> 00:14:57,583
with you--
Ow, quit doing that!

313
00:14:57,666 --> 00:14:58,791
I've gotta
do something to

314
00:14:58,875 --> 00:15:00,666
get your mind out of the gutter.

315
00:15:02,208 --> 00:15:03,458
Is that really necessary?

316
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,625
[OSHIROI] I don't
want your hands to be

317
00:15:04,708 --> 00:15:07,166
covered in germs
and oil from my hair!

318
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,166
[SATO] Got it!

319
00:15:36,416 --> 00:15:38,750
You'd better let go of me!

320
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:41,083
[OSHIROI] Oh hey, welcome back!

321
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,833
[YARIZUI] I thought you were
gonna be out with Sato.

322
00:15:43,916 --> 00:15:47,166
Nah, I decided not
to go, but I brought dinner.

323
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:48,791
Cool, then let's eat.

324
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,541
[SATO] You gonna make me go by
myself again tonight, Oshiroi?

325
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,333
Yeah, sorry.

326
00:16:08,166 --> 00:16:10,250
Hey look, I wanna
show you something.

327
00:16:10,333 --> 00:16:12,291
See this laurel wreath seal?

328
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,375
You won't believe how
we ended up with this one.

329
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,791
Our bus broke down in a
blizzard and we had to walk

330
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:20,125
three miles in the snow
to get to the supermarket.

331
00:16:20,208 --> 00:16:21,458
[OSHIROI] Really?

332
00:16:21,541 --> 00:16:23,458
[YARIZUI] When we finally
got there, ten Wolves

333
00:16:23,541 --> 00:16:25,333
were crowded
around the last bento.

334
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:27,208
We weren't about to
let them take it from us,

335
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,250
so we challenged them
and a giant fight broke out.

336
00:16:30,625 --> 00:16:33,541
It was such
a spectacular victory.

337
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:36,625
[OSHIROI] I can't
believe you beat me again.

338
00:16:36,708 --> 00:16:38,500
[YARIZUI] Well, I can't
believe that this was

339
00:16:38,583 --> 00:16:40,833
my twenty- third win in a row.

340
00:16:40,916 --> 00:16:43,333
[SATO] There's no way
you're ever gonna beat her.

341
00:16:43,416 --> 00:16:46,166
She's a pro,
just like I am at Virtua.

342
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,250
What's Virtua?

343
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,541
It's a game.
One of my all-time favorites.

344
00:16:50,625 --> 00:16:53,041
See, it's a fighting game
called Virtua Fighter 2.

345
00:16:53,125 --> 00:16:55,791
The stronger the enemy is,
the more fired up you get.

346
00:16:55,875 --> 00:16:58,375
And you have to gain respect
from the other players.

347
00:16:58,458 --> 00:16:59,750
Once you've won
them over, you'll get a

348
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,666
nickname and that
means you've really made it.

349
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:05,000
But only the
strongest get that far--

350
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:22,125
[OSHIROI] Wait for me!
I'm coming with you!

351
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:36,333
So I don't suppose
you're ready to

352
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:38,125
give me an answer
tonight, are ya?

353
00:17:38,208 --> 00:17:39,833
You mean, whether
or not I'm gonna join you

354
00:17:39,916 --> 00:17:41,666
and the Hunting Dog Unit?

355
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,708
[SATO] Well, I've
been thinking about it,

356
00:17:43,791 --> 00:17:46,083
and I'll give you my
answer later on.

357
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:48,000
In my own way.

358
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,375
Aren't you gonna take one?

359
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:20,958
[YAMAHARA] What the
hell are you doing?

360
00:18:21,041 --> 00:18:22,916
I'm giving you
my answer, Yamahara.

361
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,250
You make winning easy
but that's too boring.

362
00:18:25,333 --> 00:18:28,208
The game's not rewarding
if there's no challenge.

363
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,166
What's the fun
in fighting for bento if

364
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,375
you can just walk
up and take one?

365
00:18:33,708 --> 00:18:35,208
So here's a
little tip for ya.

366
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,125
Bentos taste better
when you earn them.

367
00:18:37,208 --> 00:18:39,375
I'd rather have one I beat a
Wolf to get, than anything

368
00:18:39,458 --> 00:18:41,958
you and your lackeys
could ever get me.

369
00:18:47,083 --> 00:18:50,125
Oh yeah, I almost forgot
to return your jacket to ya.

370
00:18:50,583 --> 00:18:51,916
Well, now
that that's over,

371
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,416
guess I'll be able to
enjoy my bento again!

372
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:58,750
Geez,
I completely forgot

373
00:18:58,833 --> 00:19:01,166
that Hiro-chan's was
closed tonight.

374
00:19:10,375 --> 00:19:11,875
We're the
Hunting Dogs, dammit!

375
00:19:11,958 --> 00:19:13,416
As long as we work together,

376
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,041
we can be victorious
even if we're weak!

377
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,416
[SATO] Whether
there's two or twenty,

378
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,750
I'll take you Dogs down!

379
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,916
You did it, Sato!

380
00:19:48,291 --> 00:19:49,916
I got one!

381
00:19:55,208 --> 00:19:56,250
Sato!
Come back!

382
00:19:56,333 --> 00:19:57,416
[DANDOU] Down, boy.

383
00:19:58,708 --> 00:19:59,750
He's got a fire that you
and the other Dogs lack.

384
00:19:59,833 --> 00:20:03,125
That kid has the eyes of a Wolf.

385
00:20:03,208 --> 00:20:05,666
Sato.
Good to know.

386
00:20:10,666 --> 00:20:12,875
[SATO] Be honest with me,
are you really cool with

387
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:15,958
being in the Half-Price
Food Lovers club?

388
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,500
Y'know Sato...

389
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:21,291
Ever since I was just a kid,
people have picked

390
00:20:21,375 --> 00:20:23,500
on me for being a
little different.

391
00:20:23,583 --> 00:20:25,000
I used to get bullied
a lot because I'm

392
00:20:25,083 --> 00:20:27,000
a germaphobe
and a bit of an oddball.

393
00:20:27,083 --> 00:20:28,833
But not anymore.

394
00:20:28,916 --> 00:20:31,583
You and Yarizui make me feel
as though I really belong!

395
00:20:31,666 --> 00:20:33,041
And--

396
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:35,875
I can't tell you how happy I
am that I met both of you!

397
00:20:35,958 --> 00:20:39,541
And that's why, I swear,
I'm truly honored to be

398
00:20:39,625 --> 00:20:42,541
one of the members of the
Half-Price Food Lovers' club.

399
00:20:42,625 --> 00:20:43,875
I didn't know.

400
00:20:43,958 --> 00:20:45,291
[OSHIROI] Come on,
let's go upstairs.

401
00:20:45,375 --> 00:20:48,875
Don't just stand there, Sato.
Yarizui's waiting.

402
00:20:57,416 --> 00:20:59,916
[YARIZUI] It looks like
you put up a good fight.

403
00:21:00,375 --> 00:21:01,875
Lemme
ask you one thing.

404
00:21:01,958 --> 00:21:04,541
What do the half-priced
bento mean to you?

405
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,750
Are they nothing more
than just left-over food?

406
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:08,166
[SATO] No, ma'am!

407
00:21:08,250 --> 00:21:11,333
[BOTH] No, they're not!
They're so much more than that!

408
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,625
[YARIZUI] Keys to the clubroom.
Hold on to 'em.

409
00:21:17,958 --> 00:21:19,500
[OSHIROI] Yes, ma'am!
[SATO] Yes, ma'am!

410
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,125
[ALL] Thanks for the meal!

411
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:25,291
[SATO] Finally!
A bento that tastes good!

412
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:28,166
[YARIZUI] You two owe me
a bite of yours, remember?

413
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,166
[SATO] What?

414
00:21:33,916 --> 00:21:36,750
[YARIZUI] Okay, guys,
now we can call it even.

415
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:40,000
[closing song]

416
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:51,083
[girl singing in Japanese]

417
00:23:11,125 --> 00:23:12,625
[SHAGA] I challenge you, Sato.

418
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:15,291
[SATO] Huh?
What're you talkin' about?

419
00:23:15,375 --> 00:23:18,208
And why're you fightin' me
with something so soft?

420
00:23:18,625 --> 00:23:21,958
That didn't hurt at all.
It kinda felt good.

421
00:23:27,625 --> 00:23:29,458
[SATO] No way.
Shaga?

422
00:23:35,375 --> 00:23:38,000
The preview?
Do I have to?

423
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:39,791
The only reason
I came over here is

424
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,833
'cause I wanna play video games.

425
00:23:42,416 --> 00:23:43,583
Let's finish
our match, Sato!

426
00:23:43,666 --> 00:23:46,208
[SATO] Aw c'mon.
Can't it wait 'til next time?
