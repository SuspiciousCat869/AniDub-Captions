1
00:00:08,416 --> 00:00:10,791
[SATO] So you're the Ice Witch.

2
00:00:10,875 --> 00:00:13,291
[YARIZUI] Yeah, so what?
Now listen to me.

3
00:00:13,375 --> 00:00:15,791
I'm not doing this for
shits and giggles.

4
00:00:16,833 --> 00:00:18,083
[OSHIROI] It's my back.

5
00:00:18,166 --> 00:00:19,833
I was up late working last
night and when I woke

6
00:00:19,916 --> 00:00:22,541
up this morning my back
felt like it was on fire.

7
00:00:22,625 --> 00:00:25,083
Those feet of hers looked like
the solution to my problem,

8
00:00:25,166 --> 00:00:27,083
and let me tell you,
they were for sure!

9
00:00:27,166 --> 00:00:29,166
[YARIZUI] She asked me
to massage her back.

10
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:30,583
[SATO THINKS] They're nice feet.

11
00:00:30,666 --> 00:00:33,583
[YARIZUI] Anyway, have
a seat and we'll get started.

12
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,041
What were you
working on so late?

13
00:00:36,125 --> 00:00:37,500
Oh, my novel.

14
00:00:37,583 --> 00:00:39,708
You never really know when
inspiration's gonna hit ya.

15
00:00:39,791 --> 00:00:41,416
That's why I have
to slave away in front

16
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,500
of the computer screen
for hours on end.

17
00:00:43,583 --> 00:00:46,291
[SATO] Wow, you're a novelist?
That's cool.

18
00:00:46,375 --> 00:00:48,750
See, me, I'm more into
playing video games.

19
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,125
[YARIZUI] Shut up.

20
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:53,208
Right now the two of you are
nothing more than Dogs.

21
00:00:53,291 --> 00:00:56,500
But if you shut your mouths and
listen, then with some hard work

22
00:00:56,583 --> 00:00:59,458
you might be able to
graduate from Dog to Wolf.

23
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:01,625
Do ya think so?

24
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:08,083
[YARIZUI] That's the spirit.
Now let's get to work.

25
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:12,291
[SATO] Wow.
That feels so amazing!

26
00:01:12,375 --> 00:01:14,625
[YARIZUI] I don't know
what you're talking about.

27
00:01:14,708 --> 00:01:15,791
Here, lemme help
you sign this paperwork.

28
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:18,916
[SATO] Hey.
Wait a second.

29
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:22,166
This is a club
entry form, isn't it?

30
00:01:22,250 --> 00:01:24,250
[YARIZUI] Maybe, don't
rack your brain over it.

31
00:01:24,333 --> 00:01:26,875
[SATO] Sorry if I seem
reluctant but Oshiroi

32
00:01:26,958 --> 00:01:29,166
lost consciousness
after she signed it.

33
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,625
And that's enough to make
anybody nervous, y'know?

34
00:01:31,708 --> 00:01:33,333
[YARIZUI] Well, you'd
better hurry and sign it.

35
00:01:33,416 --> 00:01:35,833
Unless you wanna
end up like her.

36
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:44,500
You're bigger
fools than I thought.

37
00:01:44,583 --> 00:01:46,291
Risking your lives,
and for what?

38
00:01:46,375 --> 00:01:47,958
Half-priced bento?

39
00:01:48,041 --> 00:01:51,250
I've heard it all before.
So save your breath.

40
00:01:51,333 --> 00:01:52,666
There's no need to explain.

41
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:55,916
Congratulations, Dogs.
I accept your applications.

42
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,583
You're now part of the
Half-Price Food-Lovers Club.

43
00:01:58,666 --> 00:01:59,958
Welcome.

44
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:01,833
[SATO VO] On the
morning of April ninth,

45
00:02:01,916 --> 00:02:04,041
in the year twenty-eleven AD.

46
00:02:04,125 --> 00:02:05,791
It happened again.

47
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,875
I died.

48
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,458
[opening song]

49
00:02:29,125 --> 00:02:31,083
[girl singing in Japanese]

50
00:03:49,208 --> 00:03:51,166
The mission is a 'go.'

51
00:03:53,541 --> 00:03:56,375
[YARIZUI] These are all the
supermarkets in the area.

52
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,125
The times listed are
when they usually

53
00:03:58,208 --> 00:04:00,041
mark down
their bento boxes.

54
00:04:00,125 --> 00:04:02,583
Since you two are just
starting out. I'd stick with

55
00:04:02,666 --> 00:04:05,375
either the Ho-ki Mart or
the Super Tokiwa.

56
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,416
Of course, you
know the Ho-ki Mart.

57
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,875
That's where you got your
asses kicked last night.

58
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:12,083
Both of these places
are beyond your ability,

59
00:04:12,166 --> 00:04:15,208
but you should go anyway
for the experience.

60
00:04:15,291 --> 00:04:17,958
[YARIZUI] Those supermarkets
are on my turf, but I suppose

61
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:21,000
it's time for me to mix it up
and branch out a little.

62
00:04:21,541 --> 00:04:23,041
Try not to die.

63
00:04:23,666 --> 00:04:25,833
[SATO] The Ho-Ki Mart's
God of Discounts.

64
00:04:25,916 --> 00:04:27,666
The Beefy God.

65
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:29,208
Remember,
we can't move 'til

66
00:04:29,291 --> 00:04:31,166
Beefcake's done
with his business.

67
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,875
[YARIZUI] Bento brawling
has a set of rules

68
00:04:32,958 --> 00:04:34,708
that must be followed.

69
00:04:34,791 --> 00:04:36,750
[YARIZUI] Number one:
you can't make a move until

70
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:39,833
the supermarket's God of
Discounts leaves the floor.

71
00:04:40,583 --> 00:04:43,041
Look!
I think he's done!

72
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,791
[SATO] You can't
make a move until the

73
00:04:45,875 --> 00:04:49,083
God of Discounts
leaves the floor.

74
00:04:52,541 --> 00:04:54,458
[cries of chaos]

75
00:04:56,791 --> 00:04:58,291
[SATO] Let's go!

76
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,333
[BENTO BRAWLER 2C]
Mine, all mine!

77
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:11,291
[YARIZUI] Number two, don't take

78
00:05:11,375 --> 00:05:14,166
more food than you
can eat in one sitting.

79
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:15,375
[SATO THINKING]
This is hardcore.

80
00:05:15,458 --> 00:05:17,708
I had no idea the
Wolves were so fierce.

81
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,250
Well, there're
too many rules to name.

82
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:23,083
But the most important
one of all is this:

83
00:05:23,166 --> 00:05:26,833
[YARIZUI] Always have respect.
And never lose your pride.

84
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:32,208
[Sato cries out]

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,000
Think we should
go to the next one?

86
00:05:49,791 --> 00:05:50,916
[SATO] Are you all right?

87
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,125
[OSHIROI] I think my
spine might be broken.

88
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:56,041
Hey. It's the
pup and glasses!

89
00:05:56,125 --> 00:05:57,250
What brings you guys here?

90
00:05:57,333 --> 00:05:58,916
Why'd you
call me "the pup"?

91
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,875
'Cause you're a Dog, man.
Get it?

92
00:06:00,958 --> 00:06:01,625
Hey Monk!
Wassup?

93
00:06:01,708 --> 00:06:03,166
Oshiroi.
Not so nice.

94
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:04,583
There's no harm
in being friendly

95
00:06:04,666 --> 00:06:05,916
before the brawl gets going.

96
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,958
That said, the Old Master
should be here any minute.

97
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,416
Wait, the Old who?

98
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:12,541
[MONK] Him. Super Tokiwa's
God of Discounts.

99
00:06:12,625 --> 00:06:13,875
[SATO] Whoa.

100
00:06:13,958 --> 00:06:16,041
Is it me or does he
seem pretty old for the job?

101
00:06:17,458 --> 00:06:19,208
Aw, damn it.
It's her again.

102
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:20,833
Looks like there's
a boar at the party.

103
00:06:20,916 --> 00:06:22,250
What's a boar?

104
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,041
[GOATEE] It'll take the
Old Master another five

105
00:06:24,125 --> 00:06:26,000
minutes to finish
putting the seals on.

106
00:06:26,083 --> 00:06:27,416
Goatee guy!

107
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,000
Well, should we go get
ourselves some dinner or what?

108
00:06:30,083 --> 00:06:31,833
Absolutely,
these punks need to

109
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:33,708
recognize they're on our turf!

110
00:06:33,791 --> 00:06:35,625
So cool!

111
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,708
[SATO] Oh, man.
So that's a boar?

112
00:06:45,458 --> 00:06:46,958
[SATO] Ooh, side boob.

113
00:06:56,958 --> 00:06:58,000
So you wanna
play dirty, huh?

114
00:06:58,083 --> 00:06:59,291
Damn boar!

115
00:07:01,833 --> 00:07:03,791
Run, Pup!
Get outta here!

116
00:07:04,666 --> 00:07:07,541
[BRUNETTE] Do what he says!
Run!

117
00:07:07,625 --> 00:07:11,208
Save yourselves
while you can.

118
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:12,666
Holy crap.

119
00:07:14,708 --> 00:07:15,750
[SATO] Wait a second!

120
00:07:15,833 --> 00:07:16,833
Those haven't even
been discounted yet!

121
00:07:16,916 --> 00:07:19,083
[OSHIROI] She's
taking every last one!

122
00:07:20,583 --> 00:07:22,250
[MEAN LADY 2A]
Hey, Old Man River!

123
00:07:22,333 --> 00:07:23,791
Now!

124
00:07:23,875 --> 00:07:26,416
Hurry and put the seal on these
or I'll make you regret it!

125
00:07:27,583 --> 00:07:29,625
[MEAN LADY 2A]
Whatcha waitin' for?

126
00:07:31,625 --> 00:07:33,125
[MEAN LADY 2A]
Faster, wrinkles!

127
00:07:33,208 --> 00:07:35,083
Geez. Can you
pick up the pace?

128
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:36,916
You were gonna do
it anyway, right?

129
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,250
Get it over with,
you useless, old fart.

130
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,000
[SATO]
'Boar' seems too nice for her.

131
00:07:41,083 --> 00:07:42,541
[OSHIROI] Well, whatever
you wanna call her,

132
00:07:42,625 --> 00:07:45,041
she has the fangs to fend off
the Wolves, that's for sure.

133
00:07:45,125 --> 00:07:46,833
Talk about scary.

134
00:07:46,916 --> 00:07:49,208
[GOATEE] This whole
thing's our fault.

135
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,541
[MONK] All I really
wanted was for the

136
00:07:50,625 --> 00:07:53,333
Old Master to finish
out the day on a high note.

137
00:07:55,208 --> 00:07:57,500
Pride and
respect. Always.

138
00:07:58,458 --> 00:07:59,458
[GOATEE] Oh well.

139
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,625
[BENTO BRAWLER 1F]
Man, that sucked.

140
00:08:00,708 --> 00:08:02,291
[BENTO BRAWLER 2F]
We'll get 'em next time.

141
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:04,833
[SATO THINKS]
So this is why there

142
00:08:04,916 --> 00:08:06,541
weren't any left yesterday.

143
00:08:06,625 --> 00:08:08,541
It makes
perfect sense now.

144
00:08:21,916 --> 00:08:23,708
Um. I'm sorry
I had to touch

145
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:25,875
it with my hands but
there was no other way.

146
00:08:25,958 --> 00:08:27,083
Oh...

147
00:08:27,166 --> 00:08:28,666
I'm not too finicky
about germs or anything.

148
00:08:28,750 --> 00:08:30,416
Thanks a lot!

149
00:08:34,875 --> 00:08:36,333
Wow.
So good!

150
00:08:36,416 --> 00:08:38,708
These salmon rice balls
are the best ever!

151
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,750
[SATO] Now my favorite part.

152
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,916
Yum.
You want some?

153
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:03,500
[OSHIROI]
'Kay.

154
00:09:11,458 --> 00:09:13,166
It's really good!

155
00:09:20,291 --> 00:09:21,541
What a meal.

156
00:09:21,625 --> 00:09:24,125
Bentos are great,
but this isn't half-bad either!

157
00:09:24,208 --> 00:09:25,500
[OSHIROI] Honestly,
I really wanted

158
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,833
something a
little heartier tonight.

159
00:09:27,916 --> 00:09:28,875
[SATO] Yeah, me, too.

160
00:09:28,958 --> 00:09:30,208
But sometimes
it's better to look

161
00:09:30,291 --> 00:09:31,416
on the bright side, ya know?

162
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,375
That 'Boar' could've
eaten us for dinner.

163
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:47,750
[SHIRAUME]
If you don't mind,

164
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,208
I'd like to get something
out of the way.

165
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:51,875
Sure.
What's up?

166
00:09:51,958 --> 00:09:53,333
[SHIRAUME]
I wanna hear the truth:

167
00:09:53,416 --> 00:09:55,375
what do you think of Oshiroi?

168
00:09:55,458 --> 00:09:57,416
[SATO] You seem pretty
intent on a direct answer.

169
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,458
Am I in the middle of
a love triangle here?

170
00:09:59,541 --> 00:10:01,041
[SHIRAUME] Leave her alone!
Now!

171
00:10:01,125 --> 00:10:02,833
She's mine!

172
00:10:03,333 --> 00:10:04,375
[SHIRAUME]
Do you catch my drift?

173
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,541
Uh. Just to
be perfectly clear.

174
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,125
Who's yours?

175
00:10:08,208 --> 00:10:10,166
[SHIRAUME] Oshiroi, jerk. And
I don't want you forcing her to

176
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,666
run around collecting half-price
bentos, is that clear?

177
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:16,000
[SATO] Crystal. But I'm not
forcing her to do anything;

178
00:10:16,083 --> 00:10:18,000
it's her choice to
come along.

179
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,166
There is no
way she'd ever do

180
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:21,500
something that dangerous
of her own accord.

181
00:10:21,583 --> 00:10:23,041
[SATO] If you see it
that way, you might need

182
00:10:23,125 --> 00:10:24,791
to get your eyes checked.

183
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,541
[SHIRAUME] Don't make me angry.

184
00:10:26,625 --> 00:10:28,791
You're not already?

185
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,541
[SHIRAUME] If you think
she enjoys spending time

186
00:10:31,625 --> 00:10:32,791
with you more than
she does with me,

187
00:10:32,875 --> 00:10:33,833
then I'd say you're the one who

188
00:10:33,916 --> 00:10:35,333
needs to have their
eyes checked.

189
00:10:35,416 --> 00:10:36,666
[SATO] I didn't say that!
All I said--

190
00:10:36,750 --> 00:10:38,541
Shut your stupid mouth!

191
00:10:38,625 --> 00:10:41,541
[SHIRAUME] I won't give up.
You'd better watch your back!

192
00:10:41,625 --> 00:10:44,791
[SATO] Bye bye then, I'm really
glad we had this conversation.

193
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:47,000
[SHIRAUME] What was that?
You want some more?

194
00:10:57,916 --> 00:10:59,208
[MALE VOICE 2A] Ben-To!

195
00:11:00,875 --> 00:11:03,291
Is Oshiroi
joining us today?

196
00:11:03,375 --> 00:11:05,791
Well, the thing is--

197
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,166
Uh, are you okay?
Um.

198
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,833
Hey, I bet you wanna
know about me and Ume.

199
00:11:14,916 --> 00:11:15,583
Huh?

200
00:11:15,666 --> 00:11:16,916
[OSHIROI] Let's see.

201
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:19,000
I guess the best place to
start is the beginning.

202
00:11:19,083 --> 00:11:20,833
We met in grade
school and she's been

203
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:23,291
pretty much the only
friend I've had ever since.

204
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,916
We hit it off right away.

205
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:26,625
She said she liked
reading my novels and she

206
00:11:26,708 --> 00:11:28,833
always went out of
her way to please me.

207
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,458
Wait!
That sounded bad.

208
00:11:30,541 --> 00:11:31,875
I didn't mean it that way!

209
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:33,958
She can get territorial
when it comes to me.

210
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:35,291
[SATO] No kidding.

211
00:11:35,375 --> 00:11:37,916
She beat me up just
for hangin' out with you.

212
00:11:41,208 --> 00:11:44,541
So, I'm guessing
she won't make it today.

213
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,000
What?
It's my move.

214
00:11:51,625 --> 00:11:54,625
Yeah, right.
Of course, go ahead.

215
00:11:57,375 --> 00:11:58,958
[SATO] Eleven in a row.

216
00:11:59,625 --> 00:12:02,250
This isn't even close
to a fair fight.

217
00:12:03,125 --> 00:12:05,125
[YARIZUI] It's about
time we get going.

218
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:06,666
[SATO] Yeah, guess so.

219
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:07,416
[YARIZUI] Sato.

220
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,291
[SATO] Uh, yeah?
What?

221
00:12:09,375 --> 00:12:10,291
Whether or
not you become

222
00:12:10,375 --> 00:12:14,208
a Wolf someday is all up to you.

223
00:12:16,375 --> 00:12:18,083
Geez, no pressure.

224
00:12:27,166 --> 00:12:28,750
[SATO] Which one is it?

225
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:33,083
I'm sure she'll end up
getting mad at me again.

226
00:12:33,708 --> 00:12:37,166
[marching sounds]

227
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,208
[Brunette gasps]

228
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:39,291
What's that?

229
00:12:40,708 --> 00:12:41,750
There's a storm comin'.

230
00:12:41,833 --> 00:12:42,916
What, in the store?

231
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,541
Yeah, that's what
we call the Rugby club.

232
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:46,458
They're in the middle
of spring training.

233
00:12:46,541 --> 00:12:48,416
[BRUNETTE] Those
guys are big and hungry.

234
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,708
Every time they come in,
they clean the place out.

235
00:12:50,791 --> 00:12:52,541
They're like an avalanche.

236
00:12:52,625 --> 00:12:54,333
I don't get it.

237
00:12:56,083 --> 00:12:58,500
Hey, wait up!
Why're you leaving?

238
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:00,500
There's no point
wastin' time here.

239
00:13:00,583 --> 00:13:02,750
Yeah, this was
over before it began.

240
00:13:02,833 --> 00:13:04,000
Check it out.

241
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,750
[GOATEE] A boar in
the middle of a storm?

242
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,208
[MONK] Let's try our
luck someplace else.

243
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:13,125
[revving of motorcycle engine]

244
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,125
[GOATEE] Oh, wow!

245
00:13:16,333 --> 00:13:17,416
[BRUNETTE] The Wizard!

246
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,041
So who is he?
Like a Wolf or somethin'?

247
00:13:21,125 --> 00:13:23,041
[GOATEE] Why'd he show up?

248
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,458
[MONK] Man, this is hopeless.

249
00:13:31,541 --> 00:13:34,041
[BRUNETTE] Especially
with the Wizard here.

250
00:13:34,125 --> 00:13:36,916
You comin', Pup?
Or you stickin' around?

251
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,208
I'm gonna
run inside and grab

252
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,416
a bowl of noodles real quick.

253
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,125
[SATO] The boar.

254
00:13:52,291 --> 00:13:53,916
[SATO] And the storm.

255
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:57,125
[KANESHIRO]
Are you giving up?

256
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,750
[SATO THINKS]
Who is this guy?

257
00:14:04,125 --> 00:14:06,791
Whaddya mean?
Sometimes I just feel

258
00:14:06,875 --> 00:14:09,208
like having a cup
of noodles for dinner.

259
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,125
Do you wanna be
a Wolf or don't you, kid?

260
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,083
[YARIZUI] Once you get the
taste of blood on your lips,

261
00:14:23,166 --> 00:14:25,416
you'll never be
a measly Dog again.

262
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,250
And you won't be able to
stomach a pig's humiliation.

263
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:33,250
[Sato's stomach rumbles]

264
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:38,416
"Always have respect
and never lose your pride."

265
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:40,000
Hell yeah.

266
00:14:47,708 --> 00:14:50,000
I'm not lettin' you
through 'til he's done, lady!

267
00:14:50,083 --> 00:14:53,416
From now on, you have
to play by the rules, too!

268
00:14:56,166 --> 00:15:00,916
[SATO] He's almost finished!
Just a little bit longer!

269
00:15:01,875 --> 00:15:03,625
[SATO] Oh, crap!

270
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:08,833
[Sato cries out]

271
00:15:08,916 --> 00:15:11,208
Sorry, Old Master!

272
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:15,291
[SATO] It's the Wizard!

273
00:15:15,375 --> 00:15:17,416
[KANESHIRO]
Here comes a boar charge.

274
00:15:20,250 --> 00:15:22,541
Oh wow, he used her
charge attack against her.

275
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:23,750
That was so cool!

276
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,833
It looks like he's all done.

277
00:15:36,375 --> 00:15:40,500
There's one problem.
The storm's still here.

278
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:43,166
[KANESHIRO]
Think we can take 'em?

279
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:44,750
[SATO] Yeah!

280
00:15:44,833 --> 00:15:47,125
[BENTO BRAWLER 2G] Grab all
the bentos and side dishes, men!

281
00:15:51,375 --> 00:15:54,166
Whoa! Holy crap,
the Wizard's here!

282
00:15:54,250 --> 00:15:56,416
We're screwed!

283
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,125
I'm sorry little piggies, but it

284
00:15:58,208 --> 00:16:00,833
appears the old
trough's empty tonight.

285
00:16:05,166 --> 00:16:07,916
[SATO THINKS] Amazing!
He really is a Wizard!

286
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:20,666
You came back!
Just in time!

287
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,125
Thanks a lot.

288
00:16:23,166 --> 00:16:24,583
[SATO] What's going on?

289
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,583
You're havin' all the fun!
And we can't let that happen!

290
00:16:27,666 --> 00:16:30,291
These smelly pigs
don't deserve half-price food!

291
00:16:30,375 --> 00:16:31,625
I'm glad we
could help out!

292
00:16:31,708 --> 00:16:32,750
But we're
not here for you.

293
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:35,166
Yeah, we just
came for the grub.

294
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:42,708
[BENTO BRAWLER 2G] Don't
be distracted by the Wolves!

295
00:16:42,791 --> 00:16:44,375
Go after the bento!

296
00:16:44,458 --> 00:16:45,625
[BENTO BRAWLER 2Z]
Whatever you do,

297
00:16:45,708 --> 00:16:48,458
don't let 'em take the
laurel wreath seal!

298
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,291
[SATO THINKS] The what seal?

299
00:16:52,166 --> 00:16:53,250
[BRUNETTE] Damn pigs.

300
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:54,916
You have no respect!

301
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,875
You're just a
bunch of greedy swine!

302
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,750
I think it's about time
we teach 'em a lesson in pride!

303
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:02,208
Don't waste your breath.
They're weak.

304
00:17:02,291 --> 00:17:05,000
[TOGETHER] Let's fry
these little piggies!

305
00:17:05,583 --> 00:17:06,541
Having fun?

306
00:17:06,625 --> 00:17:08,750
I'm having a blast!

307
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,833
Just don't forget what
we're fighting for.

308
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,000
Okay?

309
00:17:12,083 --> 00:17:14,250
Y'mean the pride
of the Wolves?

310
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:15,916
I won't!

311
00:17:32,291 --> 00:17:35,833
[Sato cries out]

312
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:56,291
[SATO] Aw man.
Where's my bag?

313
00:17:56,375 --> 00:17:58,166
I hope it's in the clubroom.

314
00:17:58,250 --> 00:18:00,083
[phone rings]

315
00:18:00,166 --> 00:18:01,166
[SATO] Yeah.
Hello?

316
00:18:01,250 --> 00:18:02,041
[SHIRAUME]
I thought you should know

317
00:18:02,125 --> 00:18:03,791
that Oshiroi is really upset.

318
00:18:03,875 --> 00:18:06,625
And it's all because
of you and Yarizui.

319
00:18:06,708 --> 00:18:08,083
What are
you talking about?

320
00:18:08,166 --> 00:18:09,458
[SHIRAUME]
Don't play dumb with me.

321
00:18:09,541 --> 00:18:12,166
You'll make me angry.
I'm coming for you tomorrow.

322
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:13,083
[hang up click]

323
00:18:13,166 --> 00:18:15,250
[phone beeps]

324
00:18:15,333 --> 00:18:16,958
[SATO] An email?

325
00:18:17,750 --> 00:18:20,083
[SATO] It's from Oshiroi.

326
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:26,291
"I really hope you're
not upset with me."

327
00:18:27,208 --> 00:18:29,208
I'm not upset with you;
I'm just scared of

328
00:18:29,291 --> 00:18:32,083
Shiraume and what
she might do to me.

329
00:18:35,291 --> 00:18:37,666
[SHIRAUME] You annoy me.
Stop harassing her.

330
00:18:37,750 --> 00:18:39,333
If you don't, I'll break
your fingers and

331
00:18:39,416 --> 00:18:40,916
throw your cell
phone into a river.

332
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,750
How does that
sound, you pervy creep?

333
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:44,250
See you tomorrow.

334
00:18:48,666 --> 00:18:50,791
[SATO] I knew
I left my bag here!

335
00:18:54,708 --> 00:18:56,291
[SATO] Yarizui?

336
00:18:57,250 --> 00:18:59,083
[YARIZUI] I just got a call
from someone who sounded a

337
00:18:59,166 --> 00:19:01,708
lot like Shiraume
threatening to kill me.

338
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:03,208
Where is Oshiroi?

339
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:04,875
I'm a little worried
about her now.

340
00:19:04,958 --> 00:19:06,625
With Shiraume.

341
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:08,958
Hey, what are
you doing here so late?

342
00:19:09,041 --> 00:19:11,916
Don't tell me.
You were waiting for us?

343
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,708
[YARIZUI] Well, yeah.

344
00:19:14,291 --> 00:19:16,166
[SATO] So you were
waiting yesterday, too?

345
00:19:16,250 --> 00:19:19,041
[YARIZUI] It's your
first victory, right?

346
00:19:19,125 --> 00:19:20,416
[SATO] Yeah.

347
00:19:21,708 --> 00:19:23,750
[YARIZUI] You should be proud.

348
00:19:24,416 --> 00:19:26,541
[YARIZUI] Mackerel
boil and miso?

349
00:19:26,625 --> 00:19:28,125
Did you have any
clue what you were

350
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:30,416
taking when you
grabbed this one?

351
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:32,875
[YARIZUI] This bento has
a laurel wreath seal.

352
00:19:32,958 --> 00:19:34,250
[SATO] What's that?

353
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,125
[YARIZUI] It's a special seal
the God of Discounts

354
00:19:36,208 --> 00:19:39,125
puts on the bento they
like best. You're lucky.

355
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,416
They're extremely
hard to come by.

356
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:44,625
[YARIZUI] That's
because every brawler out

357
00:19:44,708 --> 00:19:46,875
there has their sights
set on grabbing one.

358
00:19:46,958 --> 00:19:48,291
Whoever gets their hands on it

359
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:51,083
is declared the
champion of that day.

360
00:19:52,208 --> 00:19:54,500
[YARIZUI] Your first victory
has a laurel wreath seal.

361
00:19:54,583 --> 00:19:57,333
That takes some
serious talent, Sato.

362
00:19:57,416 --> 00:19:58,875
It must've been tough.

363
00:19:58,958 --> 00:20:02,833
[SATO] Yeah, it was actually.
We were up against a storm.

364
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,208
[YARIZUI] Oh?

365
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:06,000
[SATO] But the Wolf they
call the Wizard showed

366
00:20:06,083 --> 00:20:07,708
up at the last minute
and helped out.

367
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,291
The Wizard was there?

368
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,791
[YARIZUI] I know him,
he's a third year here.

369
00:20:12,875 --> 00:20:16,583
His name's Yu Kaneshiro.
Remember it well.

370
00:20:16,666 --> 00:20:18,708
[SATO] Okay then, I will.

371
00:20:20,291 --> 00:20:23,458
[SATO] Whoa!
That's a lot of seals!

372
00:20:23,541 --> 00:20:26,208
[YARIZUI] Every single one
brings back memories.

373
00:20:26,625 --> 00:20:30,375
[YARIZUI] Well, someday I'll
have to tell you about them.

374
00:20:31,083 --> 00:20:32,083
[YARIZUI] Here.

375
00:20:32,166 --> 00:20:34,291
You should put
yours inside, too!

376
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:36,083
Oh!
All right!

377
00:20:40,083 --> 00:20:41,458
Oh, cool.

378
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,708
So you write the person's
name and the date below it?

379
00:20:45,083 --> 00:20:46,500
Hey.

380
00:21:02,083 --> 00:21:04,000
[YARIZUI] Okay.
Let's dig in.

381
00:21:08,958 --> 00:21:10,083
[SATO] Yum!
[YARIZUI] Hold it...

382
00:21:10,416 --> 00:21:12,458
Always give
thanks before you eat.

383
00:21:12,541 --> 00:21:14,416
It's important.
You have to thank the

384
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,500
cook who prepared it,
the God of Discounts

385
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:20,041
who reduced it, and the brawlers
you fought against to get it.

386
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:21,833
[YARIZUI] You've gotta learn
to respect what you've

387
00:21:21,916 --> 00:21:24,416
earned and to never
take it for granted.

388
00:21:24,875 --> 00:21:27,125
Thank you for this meal.

389
00:21:27,208 --> 00:21:29,708
Thank you for this meal.

390
00:21:52,875 --> 00:21:54,833
[closing song]

391
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,708
[girl singing in Japanese]

392
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,375
In the next episode,
I'll continue to

393
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:39,125
protect Oshiroi from
the evil pervert Sato.

394
00:23:39,208 --> 00:23:40,458
What?
More?

395
00:23:40,541 --> 00:23:42,541
If I keep running my mouth
I might wake her up and

396
00:23:42,625 --> 00:23:44,750
if that happens you're
going to be very sorry.

397
00:23:44,833 --> 00:23:47,041
Now get that camera
out of my face.
