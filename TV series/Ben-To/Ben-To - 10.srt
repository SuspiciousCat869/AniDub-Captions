1
00:00:12,583 --> 00:00:13,666
[SAWAGI PRES] She's so weak.

2
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:15,541
I think we might've
got the wrong girl.

3
00:00:15,625 --> 00:00:16,958
[SAWAGI VP] Did you
even look at her?

4
00:00:17,041 --> 00:00:19,708
I mean, her hair and her
build are completely different.

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:21,625
[SAWAGI PRES]
Whatever, details shmetails.

6
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:24,208
I got too excited to
bother with such things.

[knock at door]

00:02:03,291 --> 00:02:05,375
The door's open.

17
00:02:06,833 --> 00:02:11,000
[SAWAGI PRES] Small group.
Are you the club's only members?

18
00:02:11,083 --> 00:02:13,875
[SHAGA] The class
president and vice president?

19
00:02:14,541 --> 00:02:16,125
There somethin'
I can help you with?

20
00:02:16,208 --> 00:02:18,000
[SAWAGI PRES] It's
considered dreadful manners

21
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:19,708
to speak with your
mouth full, Shaga.

22
00:02:19,791 --> 00:02:21,583
It's not an action that's very
becoming of the Beauty--

23
00:02:21,666 --> 00:02:24,083
[SAWAGI VP] Just bow.

24
00:02:24,166 --> 00:02:25,500
Oh, yes of course.

25
00:02:25,583 --> 00:02:28,458
It's proper to exchange
pleasantries first.

26
00:02:28,916 --> 00:02:30,458
We're just
dropping by to discuss

27
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,041
a simple matter with you.

28
00:02:32,125 --> 00:02:34,500
I'm sure you're aware of this,
but we still haven't received a

29
00:02:34,583 --> 00:02:37,250
report detailing your club's
activities for last month.

30
00:02:37,333 --> 00:02:38,583
[SHAGA THINKS]
We just played games.

31
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,291
[SAWAGI VP] So is your
club president available?

32
00:02:40,375 --> 00:02:41,750
[SHAGA] Uh.

33
00:02:41,833 --> 00:02:43,541
No, I'm really sorry, but
they're not here right now.

34
00:02:43,625 --> 00:02:44,875
Who is our president?

35
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,291
[SAWAGI PRES] Your club
won't receive any funding

36
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,583
next month unless you get
this turned in right away.

37
00:02:48,666 --> 00:02:50,375
Here, please tell
your president this

38
00:02:50,458 --> 00:02:52,833
is a matter of urgency
and to hand it in ASAP.

39
00:02:52,916 --> 00:02:54,125
Yeah.

40
00:02:54,208 --> 00:02:56,291
[SAWAGI PRES] Now,
the main reason we're here.

41
00:02:56,375 --> 00:02:57,666
[SHAGA] That wasn't
the main reason?

42
00:02:57,750 --> 00:02:58,833
[SAWAGI PRES]
Can you explain what

43
00:02:58,916 --> 00:03:00,458
exactly you're doing
in this photo?

44
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:01,541
[SHAGA] Um, well.

45
00:03:01,625 --> 00:03:03,375
We'd specifically like
to know under

46
00:03:03,458 --> 00:03:05,041
what pretense you would
visit the grounds of

47
00:03:05,125 --> 00:03:07,291
Karasuda High while
garbed in their uniform.

48
00:03:07,375 --> 00:03:08,916
This is quite
awkward for us.

49
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,958
They are demanding a formal
apology for the incident.

50
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,500
We believe that some form of
explanation is in order here.

51
00:03:14,583 --> 00:03:16,958
It's no big deal; I went
to see Sato and the Ice Witch.

52
00:03:17,041 --> 00:03:18,250
[SAWAGI PRES THINKS] Bingo!

53
00:03:18,333 --> 00:03:20,125
Shaga, you couldn't
possibly be referring to--

54
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:21,750
I'm sorry, but I'm
afraid we'll have to

55
00:03:21,833 --> 00:03:23,458
request the student
council summon you

56
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:24,583
for a meeting at a later date.

57
00:03:24,666 --> 00:03:27,000
We'll hear your
formal excuse there.

58
00:03:27,708 --> 00:03:28,625
Sure, whatever.

59
00:03:28,708 --> 00:03:30,125
You don't seem
very well rested.

60
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,541
Not to chastise you, but
the polite course of action

61
00:03:32,625 --> 00:03:34,791
is for one to cover their
mouth whenever they yawn.

62
00:03:34,875 --> 00:03:37,500
You really must take your nom
de guerre into consideration.

63
00:03:37,583 --> 00:03:38,541
You are the Beaut--

64
00:03:38,625 --> 00:03:40,208
[slap and then muffled voice]

65
00:03:40,291 --> 00:03:41,916
[SAWAGI VP] I don't
mean to alarm you,

66
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,583
but there's a hideous
animal in here.

67
00:03:43,666 --> 00:03:45,625
[ASEBI] What?
Really?

68
00:03:45,708 --> 00:03:49,375
I wanna play with a cute
animal! Where'd it go?

69
00:03:49,458 --> 00:03:51,458
[SHAGA] Well, geez.
Talk about stuck up.

70
00:03:51,541 --> 00:03:52,416
C'mere, sweetie!

71
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,541
Whatever.
High five, Shiraume.

72
00:03:55,125 --> 00:03:56,375
And there you have it.

73
00:03:56,458 --> 00:03:58,125
Our first contact with the
Beauty by the Lake.

74
00:03:58,208 --> 00:03:59,833
We need to
tread lightly here.

75
00:03:59,916 --> 00:04:01,583
We still don't know
to what extent these

76
00:04:01,666 --> 00:04:03,375
Wolves are connected
to one another.

77
00:04:03,458 --> 00:04:05,291
I don't think it would
be wise of us to try to

78
00:04:05,375 --> 00:04:07,375
flush them out until we
have more information.

79
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:08,875
[SAWAGI PRES]
Be honest with me, Kyo.

80
00:04:08,958 --> 00:04:10,041
Did you get the
feeling she thought

81
00:04:10,125 --> 00:04:11,541
I was some kind of weirdo?

82
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:14,125
[SAWAGI VP] Your act was a
little off, but I'm not worried,

83
00:04:14,208 --> 00:04:15,666
we could've made
a worse impression.

84
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:18,041
Besides, if she thought
anyone was a weirdo,

85
00:04:18,125 --> 00:04:21,833
I'm pretty sure it was me, which
is still your fault, of course.

86
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:27,333
[SHAGA] Games, games,
games, games, games.

87
00:04:27,416 --> 00:04:29,375
[SECURITY GUARD] Quit runnin',
you're not gettin' away!

88
00:04:29,458 --> 00:04:31,208

close to Shaga's

89

gonna get their own ass-battery!

90
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,791
[ASEBI] Whoa,
it's like a real life game!

91
00:04:34,875 --> 00:04:38,458
Sounds like Sato's
back on campus again.

92
00:04:38,958 --> 00:04:41,875
[general chaos below and
screeching tires]

93
00:04:41,958 --> 00:04:45,000
[SHAGA] Games, games.

94
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:48,166
[SHAGA] I guess I
better check on her.

95
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:53,500
Hang on. Where
did Asebi go?

96
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:56,708
Well, that makes sense.

97
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,625
[NURSE 10A] Patient Yo Sato?

98
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,375
[SATO] Right here!

99
00:05:03,458 --> 00:05:04,750
[NURSE 10A] We've got
your discharge papers,

100
00:05:04,833 --> 00:05:06,083
so you're ready to go.

101
00:05:06,166 --> 00:05:08,166
We're prescribing some
painkillers, just in case.

102
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:10,875
Be careful with them, though,
they do cause drowsiness.

103
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:18,708
[NURSE 10A] Looks
like there's a balance

104
00:05:18,791 --> 00:05:20,791
from your last
examination as well.

105
00:05:20,875 --> 00:05:24,750
So that brings you to a grand
total of ninety-four twenty.

106
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,083
[NURSE 10A] You take care now!

107
00:05:27,166 --> 00:05:28,875
Right, thanks a lot.

108
00:05:29,208 --> 00:05:31,041
This month turned
out to be a bitch.

109
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:32,625
Well, alright then.

110
00:05:32,708 --> 00:05:35,541
I've got no choice but to score
a big, fat bento the next time--

111
00:05:38,833 --> 00:05:41,166
Orthros?
Are you serious?

112
00:05:41,250 --> 00:05:42,875
This guy must
be incredibly strong.

113
00:05:42,958 --> 00:05:44,291
To say the least.

114
00:05:44,375 --> 00:05:46,416
And they've been popping
up a lot these past few days,

115
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,625
randomly taking down
eastern wolves left and right.

116
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:56,958
[NIKAIDO] Every Wolf
needs to be aware of this.

117
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,041
[SHAGA] So, what?

118
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,541
You're trying to
figure out who he is?

119
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:00,708
[NIKAIDO] If possible.

120
00:06:00,791 --> 00:06:02,125
It's gotten to the
point where none of the

121
00:06:02,208 --> 00:06:04,041
Eastern Wolves are
willing to fight them.

122
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:06,791
Every person who's faced
Orthros is now racked with

123
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:10,291
fear and they've completely
lost their taste for battle.

124
00:06:10,375 --> 00:06:13,750
Some of them would rather starve
than go to another bento brawl.

125
00:06:14,791 --> 00:06:17,416
[SHAGA] Okay, but if
he's fought that many Wolves,

126
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:19,208
all you gotta do is ask
one of them what he

127
00:06:19,291 --> 00:06:21,041
looks like and you can
figure out the rest, right?

128
00:06:21,125 --> 00:06:22,625
[NIKAIDO] It'd be great
if it were that easy,

129
00:06:22,708 --> 00:06:24,916
but none of Orthros'
victims are exactly helpful;

130
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,166
they all said the same thing
when I asked them about it.

131
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:31,333
"The next thing I knew,
I was plunged into darkness."

132
00:06:31,916 --> 00:06:34,208
[NIKAIDO] In other words,
nobody can remember.

133
00:06:34,291 --> 00:06:37,750
We've got no idea what Orthros
look like or how they fight.

134
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:39,541
There's only one
thing we do know,

135
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:42,541
Orthros is the nom de
guerre for a pack of two.

136
00:06:42,625 --> 00:06:44,166
Wait, a pack?

137
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:47,291
So, you're saying
Orthros is two people?

138
00:06:47,375 --> 00:06:49,208
[NIKAIDO] Yeah, according
to the one person

139
00:06:49,291 --> 00:06:51,833
with some memory of their
attack, a Karasuda student who

140
00:06:51,916 --> 00:06:53,375
went to a brawl in the East,

141
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,875
she was the last
victim I spoke with.

142
00:06:55,958 --> 00:06:57,083
[NIKAIDO] And she
heard something

143
00:06:57,166 --> 00:06:58,458
before she blacked out.

144
00:06:58,541 --> 00:07:01,041
[SAWAGI PRES] I think we
might've got the wrong girl.

145
00:07:01,125 --> 00:07:02,458
[SHAGA] The wrong girl?

146
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:04,708
[NIKAIDO] And she had a
theory on why they said that.

147
00:07:04,791 --> 00:07:07,708
She said she's convinced Orthros
is searching for a particular

148
00:07:07,791 --> 00:07:10,916
Wolf whom they feel will
be a worthy opponent.

149
00:07:11,291 --> 00:07:13,666
[SHAGA] Why?
What do they want?

150
00:07:25,125 --> 00:07:26,541
Did you just
say the Monarch?

151
00:07:26,625 --> 00:07:29,625
[SATO] Yeah, all splayed out
in a store on the Eastside.

152
00:07:30,791 --> 00:07:33,416
I was kinda wonderin' if
you were the one behind it.

153
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,083
And why the hell
would I do something like that?

154
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:42,041
Dammit!

155
00:07:43,666 --> 00:07:45,250
So, hey, I was thinking.

156
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,708
[SATO] Oh, yeah?

157
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:50,208
Were you still
planning to go

158
00:07:50,291 --> 00:07:51,916
to a bento brawl tomorrow night?

159
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,250
[SATO] Mm-hmm.

160
00:07:54,291 --> 00:07:55,500
Why don't you
go to a supermarket

161
00:07:55,583 --> 00:07:56,791
on the Eastside for a change?

162
00:07:56,875 --> 00:07:59,791
[SATO] Nope.
Yarizui made a good point.

163
00:07:59,875 --> 00:08:00,916
[YARIZUI] Y'know, Sato.

164
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,583
If you wanna get
back to bento brawling,

165
00:08:02,666 --> 00:08:05,375
I think you should hit
up the Kamoshida Mart.

166
00:08:05,458 --> 00:08:07,333
There aren't any
high schools in that area,

167
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:09,416
so your competition
should be light.

168
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,541
It won't mess with
your healing too much.

169
00:08:11,625 --> 00:08:14,666
You should take it easy
until you're a hundred percent.

170
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:15,916
That okay?

171
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,458
And that's
what I'm doing.

172
00:08:17,541 --> 00:08:20,000
It kinda sounded like she
might be worried about me.

173
00:08:20,083 --> 00:08:22,208
So it's the Kamoshida
Mart for me until--

174
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:26,791
What?
No way!

175
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:29,375
Bow before
your master, swine.

176
00:08:29,458 --> 00:08:31,250
[SATO] One more round!

177
00:08:31,333 --> 00:08:32,791
[SHAGA] Alright, drop dead.

178
00:08:32,875 --> 00:08:33,916
[Sato cries out]

179
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,916
[SHAGA] How'd ya like that?

180
00:08:39,333 --> 00:08:40,958
Ninety-four victories,

181
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:44,916
three hundred-seventy-eight
losses. Good morning.

182
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,333
You got somethin'
on your mind, Oshiroi?

183
00:08:48,416 --> 00:08:50,583
[OSHIROI] Maybe if
Saito was actually a decoy.

184
00:08:50,666 --> 00:08:52,208
No, that's such a cliché.

185
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:55,125
But a naked investigation,
now that's original.

186
00:08:55,208 --> 00:08:56,875
Maybe at a hot spring,
no, a changing room.

187
00:08:56,958 --> 00:08:58,333
[SATO] Ugh.
Freakin' creepy.

188
00:08:58,416 --> 00:08:59,958
[OSHIROI] And once
all of Saito's openings

189
00:09:00,041 --> 00:09:02,250
had been stuffed full--
wait, no, the lockers.

190
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:03,666
I mean the lockers.

191
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:05,916
Once Saito had been fully
stuffed inside the locker.

192
00:09:17,375 --> 00:09:19,875
[YARIZUI] Sato.
You gonna make your move?

193
00:09:19,958 --> 00:09:21,958
[SATO] Right.
Sorry.

194
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,875
You're brawling tonight.
Give it your all.

195
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:29,333
Oh, I'm planning on it.

196
00:09:29,416 --> 00:09:32,375
It's been too long since
I had half-price-- Hey!

197
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:34,666
Can I please take
back that last move?

198
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:35,833
[YARIZUI] Of course not.

199
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:37,125
[OSHIROI] I'll see
you guys later, okay?

200
00:09:37,208 --> 00:09:39,750
I'm gonna skip tonight's
brawl and head home.

201
00:09:39,833 --> 00:09:42,500
But best of luck
to the two of you!

202
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,041
[OSHIROI] Two!

203
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,250
Of course, that's it!
There are two of them!

204
00:09:46,333 --> 00:09:49,666
Geez, I can't believe it took
me this long to realize it!

205
00:09:49,750 --> 00:09:52,583
Two people are attacking Saito!

206
00:09:55,375 --> 00:09:59,000
Hold on, are you gonna
fight two people this time?

207
00:10:00,958 --> 00:10:03,333
[SHAGA] Huh.
So this is Kamoshida.

208
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,833
[SHAGA] Whoa.
What?

209
00:10:05,916 --> 00:10:07,708
Why are they here?

210
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,500
[SHAGA] I'm gonna
have to hear their crap:

211
00:10:09,583 --> 00:10:12,041
"Fighting for half-price
food is so gauche".

212
00:10:12,125 --> 00:10:13,958
They're so damn stuck up.

213
00:10:14,791 --> 00:10:16,333
[SHAGA] Well, I doubt
we've gotta worry about

214
00:10:16,416 --> 00:10:18,916
Orthros showing up at
a tiny store like this.

215
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,958
Good luck, Sato!

216
00:10:26,333 --> 00:10:27,916
And the rush
is starting to kick in.

217
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,166
I missed this feeling.

218
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:33,250
Yarizui.

219
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:35,875
I'm not sure if your logic was
entirely sound on this strategy.

220
00:10:35,958 --> 00:10:38,708
It looks like there're plenty
of hungry Wolves after all.

221
00:10:38,791 --> 00:10:40,625
Now what should I go for?

222
00:10:40,708 --> 00:10:42,750
[SAWAGI PRES AND SAWAGI VP]
Well, look who it is.

223
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:47,458
[SATO] I know you.
Huh?

224
00:10:47,541 --> 00:10:51,041
It's nice to see you again.
How are you, Pervert?

225
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:13,041
[SHAGA] What the hell?
Oh no, Sato!

226
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:23,708
[SAWAGI VP] Ben-
[SAWAGI PRES] To!

227
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,708
You're finally awake.

228
00:11:29,791 --> 00:11:31,875
You shouldn't
try to talk yet.

229
00:11:31,958 --> 00:11:35,208
It looks like Orthros pulled
a serious number on you.

230
00:11:35,291 --> 00:11:38,541
I'll explain.
Orthros is a pack of two Wolves

231
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,416
who recently
appeared on the scene.

232
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:43,416
The Beauty by the Lake can fill
in some of the details for you,

233
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:47,250
but in all honestly, we really
don't know that much about 'em.

234
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,958
I'm guessing you don't
remember anything either.

235
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,208
Then there's
no doubt they're

236
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,708
the ones who attacked you.

237
00:11:53,791 --> 00:11:57,041
And seems they've targeted
the Half-Price Food Lovers Club.

238
00:11:57,125 --> 00:11:59,458
I have a feeling
I know who's next.

239
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:00,791
[SHAGA] Chill!

240
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:04,416
[NIKAIDO] You earned that one.

241
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:07,208
Call me if you
remember anything.

242
00:12:13,416 --> 00:12:16,416
[Sawagi Pres cries
and blows bubbles]

243
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:18,666
Can you please
not drown yourself, Sis?

244
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,666
What's your problem this time?

245
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:22,041
[SAWAGI PRES] What do you think?

246
00:12:22,125 --> 00:12:24,875
The Pervert was so much
weaker than his reputation.

247
00:12:24,958 --> 00:12:26,458
[SAWAGI VP] I know how you feel.

248
00:12:26,541 --> 00:12:28,875
I simply can't believe he's the
one who took down the Monarch.

249
00:12:28,958 --> 00:12:30,416
It's quite disappointing.

250
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,708
[SAWAGI PRES] I just wasn't
expecting him to be so pitiful.

251
00:12:32,791 --> 00:12:34,500
Maybe I was a little
too rough on him.

252
00:12:34,583 --> 00:12:36,666
We should apologize
next time we see him.

253
00:12:36,750 --> 00:12:38,000
[SAWAGI VP] They're not
supposed to remember us,

254
00:12:38,083 --> 00:12:40,375
Kyo, so just walking right
up and apologizing

255
00:12:40,458 --> 00:12:42,000
for attacking them might
defeat the purpose.

256
00:12:42,083 --> 00:12:45,333
I feel completely
unfulfilled from that fight.

257
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,041
I've gotta scratch
this itch, Kyo!

258
00:12:48,125 --> 00:12:51,750
I say we hit every store around
Karasuda High starting tomorrow!

259
00:12:51,833 --> 00:12:53,500
[SAWAGI VP] You've gotta
get a grip on yourself, Sis.

260
00:12:53,583 --> 00:12:55,541
We can't draw
that much attention.

261
00:12:55,625 --> 00:12:58,625
The last thing we need
is for them to expect us.

262
00:12:58,708 --> 00:13:00,583
[SAWAGI PRES] But there's
no way we can stop now.

263
00:13:00,666 --> 00:13:02,708
We promised we would
never surrender again.

264
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:05,000
Not after what happened.

265
00:13:09,875 --> 00:13:11,250
[SAWAGI VP] I know that we can't

266
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,791
but there's just
so much at stake.

267
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:15,416
I don't think I
could live through

268
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:17,541
that kind of humiliation again.

269
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:21,500
Once was too much.
I'd rather die.

270
00:13:24,166 --> 00:13:26,166
[SATO] Oh, my head.

271
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:41,333
[SATO] Greek mythology?
Interesting.

272
00:13:42,291 --> 00:13:44,500
Orthros, that sounds--

273
00:13:45,041 --> 00:13:48,041
I'll explain. Orthros
is a pack of two Wolves

274
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:50,541
who recently appeared
on the scene.

275
00:13:52,166 --> 00:13:56,291
[SATO] Orthros is a bicephal.
A large two-headed black dog,

276
00:13:56,375 --> 00:13:59,208
brother of Cerberus,
the guard dog of Hades.

277
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:01,250
Orthros was
charged with guarding a

278
00:14:01,333 --> 00:14:03,333
herd as opposed
to the gates of Hell.

279
00:14:03,416 --> 00:14:04,916
He was killed by
Heracles during a

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,416
raid to steal the red cattle.

281
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:11,416
A tragic end for a
loyal and skilled herding dog.

282
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:13,541
[NIKAIDO] I have a feeling
I know who's next.

283
00:14:17,416 --> 00:14:20,083
[SATO] Sorry, I didn't
mean to wake you.

284
00:14:20,166 --> 00:14:23,916
Geez, I can't believe
I fell asleep like that.

285
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,291
So uh, what's this?
Not to pry or anything.

286
00:14:28,375 --> 00:14:30,083
[YARIZUI]
Oshiroi was looking at it.

287
00:14:30,166 --> 00:14:33,458
I guess she was using it as
a reference for her novel.

288
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,958
I passed out before she left,
she must've forgotten it.

289
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:38,500
Man.

290
00:14:38,583 --> 00:14:41,166
She really does a lot of work on
those creepy novels of hers.

291
00:14:41,250 --> 00:14:43,916
[YARIZUI] Why is your
face all bandaged up?

292
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,333
Well, I got the
crap kicked outta me.

293
00:14:46,416 --> 00:14:48,916
[YARIZUI] I take it that's why
you didn't come back last night?

294
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:51,000
[SATO] Yeah, sorry about that.

295
00:14:51,083 --> 00:14:52,958
[YARIZUI] There's no
need to apologize,

296
00:14:53,041 --> 00:14:55,416
I know you didn't
do it on purpose.

297
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:57,458
Just keep working on
building your health back up.

298
00:14:57,541 --> 00:14:59,666
[SATO] Yeah!
I am!

299
00:15:06,083 --> 00:15:07,625
Funny coincidence
about this book,

300
00:15:07,708 --> 00:15:08,458
the one who attacked me--

301
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:09,916
I was just thinking.

302
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:11,458
Uh, yeah?

303
00:15:11,541 --> 00:15:14,041
You know,
about tonight?

304
00:15:14,125 --> 00:15:15,708
Why don't you
come with me?

305
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:17,375
Wait.
Come with you?

306
00:15:17,458 --> 00:15:19,333
I think we should
do it together.

307
00:15:19,416 --> 00:15:21,208
[SATO] You think we should?

308
00:15:21,291 --> 00:15:22,541
[YARIZUI] Well, yeah.

309
00:15:22,625 --> 00:15:25,541
After last night, you
should come along with me.

310
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:27,375
Yeah, you're
absolutely right!

311
00:15:27,458 --> 00:15:28,666
As long as you're sure--

312
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,833
Great, we'll walk to
the market together then.

313
00:15:30,916 --> 00:15:34,333
You need to celebrate now that
you're out of the hospital.

314
00:15:34,416 --> 00:15:36,750
What better way
than half-price food?

315
00:15:37,666 --> 00:15:39,833
[SATO] Sounds good.

316
00:15:45,458 --> 00:15:47,333
I'm sure we'll
be fine tonight.

317
00:15:47,416 --> 00:15:49,000
Did you say
something to me?

318
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,208
[SATO] Oh,
it was nothing; forget it.

319
00:15:52,666 --> 00:15:54,125
[SATO THINKS] The odds of
running into Orthros two

320
00:15:54,208 --> 00:15:56,541
nights in a row
have gotta be pretty slim.

321
00:16:02,291 --> 00:16:03,333
[SATO] Shaga?

322
00:16:03,416 --> 00:16:04,583
Hey.

323
00:16:04,666 --> 00:16:07,041
[YARIZUI] I'll be
waiting over by the bento.

324
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:09,583
So what's up, what're
you doing out here?

325
00:16:09,666 --> 00:16:11,625
[SHAGA] No reason.
I just felt like it.

326
00:16:11,708 --> 00:16:13,291
[GOATEE] Hey.
Pervert.

327
00:16:13,708 --> 00:16:15,333
It's nice you're
out of the hospital and all,

328
00:16:15,416 --> 00:16:17,875
but don't expect us to go
easy on you or anything.

329
00:16:17,958 --> 00:16:20,791
We'll celebrate your discharge
by letting you watch us win.

330
00:16:20,875 --> 00:16:21,833
[SATO] Hey.

331
00:16:21,916 --> 00:16:22,750
[BRUNETTE] What?

332
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,041
[SATO]
Your head, are you okay?

333
00:16:25,125 --> 00:16:26,833
[BRUNETTE] It's nothin',
just a few scratches.

334
00:16:26,916 --> 00:16:28,250
[MONK] It could've
been a lot worse

335
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,916
but she passed out
after the first punch.

336
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:35,083
Whoa!
What the hell?

337
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:35,916
[SHAGA] Hey!

338
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,583
[SATO] Good evening ladies!

339
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:40,083
Thanks!
Good evening to you too!

340
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:43,875
Y'know, this feels
familiar somehow.

341
00:16:43,958 --> 00:16:46,375
Are you guys--are you twins?

342
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,083
We would like
to apologize to you.

343
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:50,500
We got a little carried
away yesterday.

344
00:16:51,333 --> 00:16:54,166
I don't know why
you're apologizing, but okay.

345
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,458
I'm so glad we got
the chance to see you again.

346
00:16:56,541 --> 00:16:58,541
[SATO] Yeah, me too,
I'm twice as glad.

347
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,250
I feel like I'm at a buy-one
get-one free sale.

348
00:17:01,333 --> 00:17:02,750
Oh my goodness,
how rude of us,

349
00:17:02,833 --> 00:17:05,083
I just realized we haven't
even introduced ourselves yet.

350
00:17:05,166 --> 00:17:06,708
My name is Kyo Sawagi.

351
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,083
And this is my
little sister, Kyo.

352
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:10,916
[SATO] Wait.
Kyo and Kyo?

353
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:12,333
Yes.

354
00:17:12,416 --> 00:17:13,791
It's pronounced the same
but the character is different.

355
00:17:13,875 --> 00:17:15,791
See, my 'Kyo' is the one
in myocardial infarction and--

356
00:17:15,875 --> 00:17:17,041
Her 'Kyo' is the one in

357
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,375
bellflower and my
'Kyo' is the one in mirror.

358
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:21,041
[SAWAGI PRES] Exactly,
that's what I meant.

359
00:17:21,125 --> 00:17:23,500
Don't forget it
when you see us again.

360
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:31,875
Always a pleasure to
see you, Beauty by the Lake.

361
00:17:36,333 --> 00:17:38,208
What's with you?
Is something wrong?

362
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:40,000
[BRUNETTE] No.
I guess not.

363
00:17:42,750 --> 00:17:44,291
"It's warm and gentle.

364
00:17:44,375 --> 00:17:47,041
A flavor I remember from long
ago at my Grandmother's.

365
00:17:47,125 --> 00:17:50,083
A Japanese dish easy on
both mind and body.

366
00:17:50,166 --> 00:17:51,916
Plum and dried
sardines over rice,

367
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,916
served with seasonal
vegetables." It's mine.

368
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,333
Freaking long name.

369
00:17:56,416 --> 00:17:57,416
I was starting to
get worried you

370
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,958
were having a
stroke or somethin'.

371
00:17:59,041 --> 00:18:00,500
But that's just your meal.

372
00:18:00,583 --> 00:18:03,166
I'm gonna shoot
for the shrimp tempura.

373
00:18:23,208 --> 00:18:25,083
Pervert!
Look out!

374
00:18:26,875 --> 00:18:28,208
Whoa, Shaga!

375
00:18:30,166 --> 00:18:31,583
[YARIZUI] What the--?

376
00:18:34,125 --> 00:18:35,791
What the hell
is goin' on here?

377
00:18:35,875 --> 00:18:37,833
[YARIZUI] Sato!
Look!

378
00:18:44,416 --> 00:18:45,916
Ice Witch!
Be careful!

379
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,666
Watch out for the basket!

380
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,541
[SAWAGI PRES] The Ice Witch?

381
00:18:51,541 --> 00:18:55,125
[SAWAGI PRES] We've found you!
At long last, we finally meet!

382
00:18:55,541 --> 00:18:57,333
This moment's
been a long time coming.

383
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,000
If only you could
know how eagerly

384
00:18:59,083 --> 00:19:01,041
we've anticipated
meeting you in battle.

385
00:19:01,125 --> 00:19:03,250
Make it count, Ice Witch.

386
00:19:23,166 --> 00:19:24,500
Holy-- Look at that!

387
00:19:24,583 --> 00:19:26,708
They're using the
baskets for their attacks!

388
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:35,125
[SATO] I see.
So they're the ones.

389
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:37,250
[SHAGA] They're Orthros!

390
00:19:37,333 --> 00:19:39,625
What?
Orthros?

391
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:46,375
[SHAGA] Bring it on!

392
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:53,916
Nice try, Beauty.

393
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,833
But you're weaker
than you realize.

394
00:19:55,916 --> 00:19:58,458
[NIKAIDO] I'm putting
you down, Orthros!

395
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:01,208
[SAWAGI VP] Sure,
you might have led the

396
00:20:01,291 --> 00:20:02,833
Gabriel Ratchet
back in your day.

397
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:05,000
[SAWAGI PRES] But your
time has come and gone!

398
00:20:20,916 --> 00:20:22,125
[SAWAGI VP]
Is this all you've got?

399
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,958
[SAWAGI PRES] You're
disappointing us, Witch!

400
00:20:27,333 --> 00:20:28,666
[SATO] You got 'em!

401
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:36,208
[SAWAGI PRES] I know it's
rude but I can't help laughing!

402
00:20:40,541 --> 00:20:41,833
[SATO] Yarizui!

403
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:47,500
[SATO] Go!
Now!

404
00:20:47,583 --> 00:20:48,750
[YARIZUI] Sato, behind you!

405
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,416
[BOTH] The moment
we've been waiting for!

406
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:12,875
[SHAGA] The Ice Witch.
She's down.

407
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:16,166
[SATO] Yarizui.
I can't believe it.

408
00:21:18,166 --> 00:21:21,583
[SAWAGI PRES] It was well worth
the long wait, wasn't it, Kyo?

409
00:21:21,666 --> 00:21:23,791
[SAWAGI VP] Yes,
it was, Sis. It really was.

410
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,541
You must be
so angry with us.

411
00:21:25,625 --> 00:21:27,750
I know I'd be furious
if I was in your place.

412
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:29,541
Oh, please tell me
you want revenge,

413
00:21:29,625 --> 00:21:31,416
'cause we really
wanna fight you again!

414
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,875
You come find us as soon
as you're ready, okay?

415
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:37,291
We'll wait patiently
for you until then.

416
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:40,875
It's all mine.

417
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:44,166
Good work, Sis.
Now let's get out of here.

418
00:21:48,041 --> 00:21:49,708
How could this happen?

419
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:53,875
[closing song]

420
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,708
[girl singing in Japanese]

421
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,625
Don't forget,
our name is Orthros.

422
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,083
We don't run and we do not hide.

423
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:25,250
[SAWAGI VP] Come and find us.

424
00:23:25,333 --> 00:23:27,291
Hunt us to the
ends of the earth.

425
00:23:27,375 --> 00:23:28,875
[SAWAGI PRES] If you dare.

426
00:23:33,416 --> 00:23:34,500
[SAWAGI PRES]
Maybe we should've been more

427
00:23:34,583 --> 00:23:36,166
careful with our
wording back there.

428
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,958
I mean, what if the
Pervert decides to stalk us?

429
00:23:39,041 --> 00:23:40,833
They do call him
the Pervert for a reason!

430
00:23:40,916 --> 00:23:42,416
[SAWAGI VP] Yeah,
you say that now,

431
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:44,875
but you'd complain even more
if he didn't start stalking us.

432
00:23:44,958 --> 00:23:46,916
Well yeah,
I'd be insulted!
