1
00:00:08,666 --> 00:00:10,083
[OSHIROI] The battle with the
diabolical Anarch had begun.

2
00:00:10,166 --> 00:00:11,250
[OSHIROI] "I'm gonna
ruffle your feathers

3
00:00:11,333 --> 00:00:12,958
from top to bottom,
little chicky."

4
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:14,833
[OSHIROI] And so he did,
tearing at the innocent Saito

5
00:00:14,916 --> 00:00:17,166
from behind and giving him
a very dirty surprise!

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,833
But the Anarch was
also using the power

7
00:00:18,916 --> 00:00:20,500
of his minions,
the Shabrael Rachet,

8
00:00:20,583 --> 00:00:23,166
to take over all the
steaming hot saunas in town.

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:25,541
Legs sprawled in
defeat, bodies glistening,

10
00:00:25,625 --> 00:00:27,833
the boys submit to the
Anarch, longing for release.

11
00:00:27,916 --> 00:00:30,041
But Saito attempted
to penetrate the Anarch's

12
00:00:30,125 --> 00:00:31,916
defenses with
his rock hard passion.

13
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,333
Will our hero end
up on top or on bottom?

14
00:00:34,416 --> 00:00:36,250
Muscle Cop Episode 6!

15
00:00:36,333 --> 00:00:38,458
[OSHIROI]
Don't you dare miss it!

16
00:00:42,541 --> 00:00:45,333
[MATSUBA]
What a lovely surprise.

17
00:00:45,416 --> 00:00:47,791
Did my old rival come
here to cheer me up?

18
00:00:47,875 --> 00:00:49,458
[KANESHIRO] Sorry,
but I'm not one

19
00:00:49,541 --> 00:00:51,125
to bother over
things like that.

20
00:00:51,208 --> 00:00:53,125
I actually came
here to say goodbye.

21
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:55,375
I'm afraid I have to
leave the city for a while.

22
00:00:55,458 --> 00:00:56,833
[MATSUBA] You're leaving?

23
00:00:56,916 --> 00:00:59,541
[KANESHIRO] Yeah, it turns
out I'll be studying abroad.

24
00:00:59,625 --> 00:01:02,208
I see.
Good for you.

25
00:01:02,291 --> 00:01:04,666
It's nice to know that
you're as free as ever.

26
00:01:04,750 --> 00:01:06,000
I'm jealous.

27
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:08,958
But to be perfectly
honest, I was hoping

28
00:01:09,041 --> 00:01:11,833
you'd be able to put
a stop to Endo's plan.

29
00:01:11,916 --> 00:01:13,833
[KANESHIRO] I wouldn't
worry about that.

30
00:01:13,916 --> 00:01:16,291
Wolves have their own
set of rules, you know.

31
00:01:16,375 --> 00:01:17,625
Those who break them will be

32
00:01:17,708 --> 00:01:19,791
thrown out of the
pack eventually.

33
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:21,416
[MATSUBA] You think?

34
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:25,125
I still believe in the
pride the Wolves possess.

35
00:01:25,208 --> 00:01:27,416
I know you do.

36
00:01:29,916 --> 00:01:34,208
[KANESHIRO] Well, take
care, Monarch Butterfly.

37
00:01:38,333 --> 00:01:40,291
[opening theme]

38
00:01:59,958 --> 00:02:01,916
[girl singing in Japanese]

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:14,458
[YARIZUI] It seems
everyone is here.

40
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:16,250
So let's begin, shall we?

41
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:19,541
[YARIZUI] Do you hear me,
Wolves of the West?

42
00:03:20,666 --> 00:03:21,708
[WEST WOLF 6A]
Get over yourself.

43
00:03:21,791 --> 00:03:23,375
What, you think
you're our leader?

44
00:03:23,458 --> 00:03:24,625
[WEST WOLF 6B]
That's fine by me.

45
00:03:24,708 --> 00:03:26,333
It's the Ice Witch
we're talking about here.

46
00:03:26,416 --> 00:03:28,333
[WEST WOLF 6C] Just hurry
and get this started already.

47
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:30,416
[YARIZUI] I believe I've
already told you everything I

48
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,291
know about the Monarch's plot,

49
00:03:32,375 --> 00:03:35,333
so I don't need to go
over the details, right?

50
00:03:35,416 --> 00:03:38,000
[WEST WOLF 6A] He's planning
on taking over the West, right?

51
00:03:38,083 --> 00:03:40,250
Monarch sure is
thinking big these days.

52
00:03:40,333 --> 00:03:41,541
[WEST WOLF 6B]
He's just an idiot.

53
00:03:41,625 --> 00:03:42,666
[WEST WOLF 6C]
Even if he comes out

54
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,041
swinging with all of his men,

55
00:03:44,125 --> 00:03:45,333
what does he think
he's gonna accomplish?

56
00:03:45,416 --> 00:03:46,416
[WEST WOLF 6B] Hey, stop it!

57
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,166
Why the hell're
you peeing in public?

58
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,583
[WEST WOLF 6C]
That's not me, man.

59
00:03:49,666 --> 00:03:50,750
Chill out.

60
00:03:50,833 --> 00:03:52,541
It's just a dog
marking his territory.

61
00:03:52,625 --> 00:03:54,916
[WEST WOLF 6B] Look at this guy!
He can't hold it in, either!

62
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,875
And to top it
all off, he's naked!

63
00:03:56,958 --> 00:03:58,375
[WEST WOLF 6D] Ew.
Gross.

64
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:00,250
[WEST WOLF 6A] Anyway, the
Monarch can come if he likes,

65
00:04:00,333 --> 00:04:03,166
but there's no way he's
beating us in our own territory.

66
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:04,041
[WEST WOLF 6B] Exactly.

67
00:04:04,125 --> 00:04:05,375
That's what I'm talkin' about!

68
00:04:05,458 --> 00:04:07,666
We know how good the
bentos from our turf taste.

69
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:09,583
As long as we have
that hunger we won't let

70
00:04:09,666 --> 00:04:11,541
anyone take them away from us!

71
00:04:11,625 --> 00:04:12,750
[YARIZUI] I see.

72
00:04:12,833 --> 00:04:15,000
Your hunger will be
satisfied that easily?

73
00:04:15,083 --> 00:04:16,583
[WEST WOLF 6A]
What are you implying?

74
00:04:16,666 --> 00:04:18,916
So long as the Monarch's
able to wreak havoc,

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,291
there's a hole in my
stomach that'll never be filled.

76
00:04:21,375 --> 00:04:22,916
[WEST WOLF 6D]
So you have a plan?

77
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,875
I think it's time for
us to go on the offensive.

78
00:04:25,958 --> 00:04:27,083
While you're all fighting,

79
00:04:27,166 --> 00:04:29,041
I'm going after his home
base-- Ralph Store.

80
00:04:29,125 --> 00:04:30,250
[SATO] What?

81
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:31,833
And you're positive
this is the only way?

82
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:33,666
All right, but what do you
want us to do to help out?

83
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:34,958
[YARIZUI] Oh, it's quite simple.

84
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,500
You'll take care
of our home base.

85
00:04:36,583 --> 00:04:39,041
Yeah, that sounds like
a lot of responsibility to me.

86
00:04:39,125 --> 00:04:41,708
[WEST WOLF 6B] They
sure won't be expecting that.

87
00:04:41,791 --> 00:04:43,750
[WEST WOLF 6A] You do
whatever you want, Ice Witch.

88
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:45,125
We'll keep fighting,

89
00:04:45,208 --> 00:04:48,458
eating and protecting
our pride, just like always.

90
00:04:48,541 --> 00:04:49,583
[YARIZUI] I'm counting on you.

91
00:04:49,666 --> 00:04:51,333
Uh, okay.

92
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:52,666
[YARIZUI] You know what to do.

93
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:55,083
Let's make our
preparations for the battle.

94
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:58,333
Don't you dare let the
West fall while I'm gone.

95
00:04:59,625 --> 00:05:01,291
[YARIZUI] All right.
Be careful out there.

96
00:05:01,375 --> 00:05:04,291
[SATO] Uh, Yarizui, are you
sure you're okay alone?

97
00:05:04,375 --> 00:05:05,541
[YARIZUI]
At Ralph Store,

98
00:05:05,625 --> 00:05:08,416
the bento with a seal is
zangee chicken karaage.

99
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,666
It's made just
for Wolves like us.

100
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:13,791
Created by Macchan,
a former Wolf herself.

101
00:05:13,875 --> 00:05:15,791
From what I'm told,
its flavor is unrivaled.

102
00:05:15,875 --> 00:05:18,291
All right, but that isn't
really the issue here.

103
00:05:18,375 --> 00:05:20,416
There's no need
to act so worried.

104
00:05:20,500 --> 00:05:22,208
I'm just going to
grab some dinner,

105
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:24,833
just like any other night.

106
00:05:27,250 --> 00:05:29,583
[OSHIROI] She's so cool.

107
00:05:30,958 --> 00:05:32,500
[YARIZUI THINKS]
It's over tonight, Monarch.

108
00:05:32,583 --> 00:05:35,208
I'm putting an end to this.

109
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,791
[SHAGA]
"Monarch Butterfly?" Who's that?

110
00:05:38,875 --> 00:05:40,333
[EAST WOLF 6A] That's what
they used to call Macchan back

111
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:42,166
when she was active as a Wolf.

112
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,666
She was strong,
maybe the strongest.

113
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:47,000
And more beautiful than
you could ever imagine.

114
00:05:47,083 --> 00:05:48,750
All of the East Wolves
looked up to her;

115
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,625
she was like a hero
or a goddess to us.

116
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:53,833
Oh, thank you.

117
00:05:53,916 --> 00:05:55,250
Anyway, about a year ago,

118
00:05:55,333 --> 00:05:57,416
the Monarch Butterfly had
a battle with the Wizard,

119
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,791
who was considered the strongest
Wolf in the West at the time.

120
00:06:01,333 --> 00:06:03,166
[EAST WOLF 6A] Both were
evenly matched, but when their

121
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:05,583
epic struggle reached
its conclusion.

122
00:06:08,041 --> 00:06:09,208
[EAST WOLF 6A]
It was the Wizard,

123
00:06:09,291 --> 00:06:12,041
who ultimately claimed
the laurel wreath seal.

124
00:06:21,250 --> 00:06:22,250
[EAST WOLF 6A] But that night,

125
00:06:22,333 --> 00:06:24,250
the Wizard was
found unconscious,

126
00:06:24,333 --> 00:06:26,041
passed out in the
middle of the road.

127
00:06:26,125 --> 00:06:30,166
And next to him, there was an
empty bento on the ground.

128
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:32,250
Huh? So what
happened to him?

129
00:06:32,333 --> 00:06:34,000
The Wizard may
have prevailed in battle,

130
00:06:34,083 --> 00:06:35,458
but it left him so exhausted,

131
00:06:35,541 --> 00:06:37,916
he didn't have the
strength to return home.

132
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,916
[EAST WOLF 6A] But even though
his body refused to go on,

133
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,333
he wouldn't let
the food go to waste.

134
00:06:42,416 --> 00:06:46,541
He savored every last bite
until his consciousness faded.

135
00:06:47,875 --> 00:06:50,000
I never thought
of the Wizard like that.

136
00:06:50,083 --> 00:06:51,416
Though to be honest,

137
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:53,291
I can't really think of anyone
who'd be crazy enough to

138
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,583
collapse in the middle of street

139
00:06:54,666 --> 00:06:56,333
and keep eating until
they passed out.

140
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:59,791
[EAST WOLF 6A] If you'd seen the
fight, maybe you'd understand...

141
00:06:59,875 --> 00:07:00,708
By the way,

142
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,166
Tadaaki Endo was
an underclassmen

143
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,625
who attended the same
school that Macchan went to.

144
00:07:04,708 --> 00:07:07,041
As you know,
he's the current "Monarch."

145
00:07:07,125 --> 00:07:09,375
[EAST WOLF 6A] After Macchan got
married and quit being a Wolf,

146
00:07:09,458 --> 00:07:11,291
he and his gang
stepped up and brought

147
00:07:11,375 --> 00:07:13,333
the East together in a snap.

148
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,208
[EAST WOLF 6A] But he
still can't cope with the fact

149
00:07:17,291 --> 00:07:19,875
that his old upperclassman
lost that battle.

150
00:07:19,958 --> 00:07:21,291
And that's why he
wants to take over

151
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,041
the West while the
Wizard is still here.

152
00:07:23,125 --> 00:07:24,166
[EAST WOLF 6A] Not quite.

153
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,875
The truth is,
his big plan to conquer

154
00:07:25,958 --> 00:07:27,416
both sides is
nothing but a bluff.

155
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:29,125
The only thing he's
really interested in

156
00:07:29,208 --> 00:07:32,041
is the title of
"the strongest Wolf."

157
00:07:32,791 --> 00:07:34,833
He didn't like the way that
battle ended a year ago.

158
00:07:34,916 --> 00:07:38,000
So he's trying to recreate it
and make sure his side wins.

159
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:39,250
If he's supposed to be the

160
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:40,750
successor to the
Monarch Butterfly,

161
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:42,208
there's no better
way to prove that

162
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:44,250
than to defeat the
Wizard's successor.

163
00:07:44,333 --> 00:07:46,000
Hold on a second--
are you talking about

164
00:07:46,083 --> 00:07:48,208
who I think
you're talking about?

165
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,041
The Monarch's Dogs
are looking for scraps, again?

166
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,916
They'll have to
get past us first.

167
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,541
[GOATEE] He can
send as many of his pets

168
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:09,958
as he wants,
makes no difference to us.

169
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:26,000
[SHAGA] Stop right there!

170
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,416
[SATO] Shaga?

171
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:30,041
[SHAGA] We need to talk.

172
00:08:30,125 --> 00:08:31,958
[SATO] What? Is right
now really the time for this?

173
00:08:32,041 --> 00:08:33,291
[SHAGA] No complaining!

174
00:08:33,375 --> 00:08:36,125
[SATO] Shaga, come on!
What is wrong with you?

175
00:08:36,875 --> 00:08:38,083
Okay, that was awkward.

176
00:08:38,166 --> 00:08:39,875
So is he coming back?

177
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:43,583
[SATO] Then his real plan
is just to beat Yarizui?

178
00:08:43,666 --> 00:08:46,208
So it would seem.
He wants to prove himself.

179
00:08:46,291 --> 00:08:47,833
Or at least that's
what the retired

180
00:08:47,916 --> 00:08:49,375
Wolf I talked to told me.

181
00:08:49,458 --> 00:08:52,000
It turns out he's calling
himself the Monarch because he

182
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,291
wants to become the successor
to the Monarch Butterfly.

183
00:08:55,375 --> 00:08:56,333
[SHAGA] You get it?

184
00:08:56,416 --> 00:08:57,416
It's no coincidence
that he chose

185
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,416
that nom de guerre for himself.

186
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:02,250
We were wrong in thinking that
he wanted to conquer the West.

187
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,541
What he really wants is to
settle an old score by

188
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:07,500
defeating the Wizard's
successor, the Ice Witch.

189
00:09:07,583 --> 00:09:09,083
But that's crazy.

190
00:09:09,166 --> 00:09:11,791
[SHAGA] Anyway, you'd better go
warn her before it's too late.

191
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:13,500
We both know the
Monarch isn't afraid to

192
00:09:13,583 --> 00:09:15,166
play dirty to get what he wants.

193
00:09:15,250 --> 00:09:17,333
[SATO] She said she was
targeting his home turf.

194
00:09:17,416 --> 00:09:19,125
She wanted to end this tonight,

195
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,458
so she left for
Ralph Store by herself.

196
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:23,333
What was she thinking?

197
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:27,041
[SATO] It's no use.

198
00:09:27,125 --> 00:09:28,541
[DUDE 6A] I heard some
guys in the East were

199
00:09:28,625 --> 00:09:30,541
beating up this girl in
front of the plaza.

200
00:09:30,625 --> 00:09:31,875
It's screwed up!

201
00:09:31,958 --> 00:09:33,041
[DUDE 6B] Dude, are you serious?

202
00:09:33,125 --> 00:09:34,708
[DUDE 6C] Think we
should call the cops?

203
00:09:40,333 --> 00:09:41,875
We're coming for ya.

204
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,791
[MALE ONLOOKER 6A]
What the hell was that?

205
00:09:45,875 --> 00:09:48,583
All those guys
going after one girl?

206
00:09:50,208 --> 00:09:51,625
Hey, what happened here?

207
00:09:51,708 --> 00:09:53,958
Some gang dressed in
all black beat up a girl.

208
00:09:54,041 --> 00:09:56,625
[SATO] Dressed in black?
Then that means.

209
00:09:56,708 --> 00:09:58,791
[SHAGA] Yeah.
Gabriel Ratchet.

210
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,708
Damn Monarch.

211
00:10:04,333 --> 00:10:06,958
[SHAGA] I'm an East Wolf,
which means the Ice Witch is

212
00:10:07,041 --> 00:10:10,125
supposed to be my enemy,
but this is different.

213
00:10:10,208 --> 00:10:12,666
I can't forgive them for this!

214
00:10:34,041 --> 00:10:35,916
[MATSUBA] It's been a
while, hasn't it, Nikaido?

215
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,041
Oh.
Hey, Macchan.

216
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:40,416
Would you mind telling
me what this is all about?

217
00:10:40,500 --> 00:10:42,708
I've heard the rumors,
but now I want the truth.

218
00:10:42,791 --> 00:10:44,916
[NIKAIDO] Even if I did
tell you, then what?

219
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,583
You're not a Wolf
anymore, are you?

220
00:10:46,666 --> 00:10:48,333
[MATSUBA] I suppose
asking for personal

221
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,041
reasons isn't
good enough, then?

222
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,958
Please, I think
I deserve to know.

223
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:54,291
Just tell me what
you're planning.

224
00:10:54,375 --> 00:10:56,000
[NIKAIDO]
Look, I'm sorry but--

225
00:11:00,625 --> 00:11:04,166
[MATSUBA] Nikaido,
what on earth did you do?

226
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:05,416
Of course.

227
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,291
So this is why you've
gathered everyone here.

228
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,500
All of Gabriel Ratchet
has come together to

229
00:11:09,583 --> 00:11:11,666
show the strength
of the Eastern Territory.

230
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:15,958
But you're not hunting.
You're here to incite a war.

231
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:18,000
[MATSUBA] As you said,
I'm not a Wolf anymore.

232
00:11:18,083 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm nothing but a
supermarket employee now,

233
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:23,000
and I can't do
anything to stop you.

234
00:11:23,083 --> 00:11:25,750
However,
as a human being,

235
00:11:25,833 --> 00:11:28,166
I despise you for doing this.

236
00:11:36,958 --> 00:11:39,458
[ENDO] You've seen
better days, Ice Witch.

237
00:11:40,208 --> 00:11:42,208
[YARIZUI] Even at my worst,
I'm better than you.

238
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:44,333
You're not a Wolf,
you're not even human.

239
00:11:44,416 --> 00:11:47,000
Just a beast without
pride or shame.

240
00:11:48,458 --> 00:11:50,666
[ENDO] Howl while
you can, Ice Witch.

241
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,291
Because once I defeat you,

242
00:11:52,375 --> 00:11:55,125
this "beast" is going
to be a conqueror.

243
00:11:55,541 --> 00:11:57,875
[ENDO] Let's see how long
that pride of yours lasts when

244
00:11:57,958 --> 00:11:59,708
I've claimed the title
of the strongest

245
00:11:59,791 --> 00:12:01,583
and you're groveling at my feet!

246
00:12:02,875 --> 00:12:05,208
Stop it, this has gone
far enough, Monarch,

247
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,208
or should I just say Endo?

248
00:12:07,291 --> 00:12:09,500
[NIKAIDO] Regardless of what
you say, I know that it isn't

249
00:12:09,583 --> 00:12:11,708
your strength you're
trying to prove here.

250
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:13,750
It's freedom that you long for.

251
00:12:13,833 --> 00:12:15,625
On the wings of a butterfly.

252
00:12:15,708 --> 00:12:17,500
[MATSUBA]
Is that true, Nikaido?

253
00:12:17,583 --> 00:12:20,791
[NIKAIDO] You know as well
as I do that this is pointless.

254
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:22,083
Even if you inherit her name,

255
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,791
nothing will change for
you or anyone else.

256
00:12:24,875 --> 00:12:28,125
The Monarch Butterfly
is already gone!

257
00:12:28,208 --> 00:12:29,750
[ENDO] Shut up!

258
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,541
What are you doing?

259
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:35,291
Forgive me, Macchan.

260
00:12:35,625 --> 00:12:37,333
[MATSUBA] Nikaido, are you okay?

261
00:12:37,416 --> 00:12:39,916
[ENDO] He's not your concern,
Goddess of Discounts!

262
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,833
Are you going to prepare
the half-price labels or not?

263
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,750
[MATSUBA THINKS] Why did
it have to turn out like this?

264
00:13:11,458 --> 00:13:15,791
I'm sorry, but there's
nothing I can do.

265
00:13:16,666 --> 00:13:18,666
You can take your
pride to the grave with you.

266
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,875
I'll bury you myself!

267
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,750
[SATO] Stop!

268
00:13:26,541 --> 00:13:29,041
You've gone far
enough, Monarch!

269
00:13:35,875 --> 00:13:36,916
[MALE VOICE 6A] Ben-To!

270
00:13:39,791 --> 00:13:41,791
What are
you doing, Sato?

271
00:13:41,875 --> 00:13:44,541
Didn't I tell you your job
was to protect the West?

272
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:48,125
[SATO] Oshiroi is there.
So are Brunette and Goatee.

273
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:49,958
Besides, if we didn't
come to help you,

274
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:51,875
what kinda friends would we be?

275
00:13:51,958 --> 00:13:55,416
[SATO] And don't think I forgot.
You said it yourself, right?

276
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,833
You hate guys who stand by

277
00:13:56,916 --> 00:13:59,083
and do nothing
when a girl is hurting.

278
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:02,666
[ENDO] You had me worried
for a second there, Ice Witch.

279
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:04,916
I actually thought someone
worthwhile was coming

280
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,791
to save you, not a
useless pair of weaklings.

281
00:14:07,875 --> 00:14:09,083
You can say
what you want,

282
00:14:09,166 --> 00:14:10,916
but the fact remains
that they're Wolves.

283
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,625
Do you understand, Monarch?

284
00:14:12,708 --> 00:14:14,833
In other words,
someone who's not a Wolf,

285
00:14:14,916 --> 00:14:16,166
who's not a Dog,

286
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:18,416
who's nothing but a filthy
rat has no room to talk.

287
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,666
How's that?

288
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,041
That's quite
a mouth you've got.

289
00:14:22,125 --> 00:14:24,041
Who do you think
you're talking to?

290
00:14:24,125 --> 00:14:25,875
[SHAGA] To you, obviously.

291
00:14:25,958 --> 00:14:27,541
But if I was talking to a wall,

292
00:14:27,625 --> 00:14:29,916
it'd make for better
conversation.

293
00:14:30,708 --> 00:14:34,166
[weird noise]

294
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:36,333
[SATO] What's that noise?

295
00:14:36,791 --> 00:14:38,541
You're kiddin' me!

296
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:44,583
[YARIZUI] Letting your
stomach do the talking, are you?

297
00:14:44,666 --> 00:14:46,791
With the half price
bentos right in front of us,

298
00:14:46,875 --> 00:14:49,208
there's no need for
words anymore.

299
00:14:49,291 --> 00:14:52,000
That's fine. I'll beat
my message into you.

300
00:14:52,083 --> 00:14:54,791
Our pride as Wolves
won't let us lose to a rat!

301
00:14:54,875 --> 00:14:58,333
Treat others with respect,
and never lose your pride!

302
00:14:58,416 --> 00:15:00,125
[ALL] Those are the
rules of this battlefield!

303
00:15:00,208 --> 00:15:01,916
Attack!

304
00:15:03,541 --> 00:15:04,833
We are the Wolves.

305
00:15:04,916 --> 00:15:07,000
We uphold our rules and
put our pride on the line!

306
00:15:07,083 --> 00:15:10,375
To the victor go eternal
glory and half-price bentos!

307
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,791
And to the defeated only
disgrace and hunger awaits!

308
00:15:13,875 --> 00:15:16,333
[ENDO] You need
to learn your place!

309
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,583
[ENDO] How does it feel
to taste the power of a

310
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:21,291
man who's been
fasting for three days?

311
00:15:21,375 --> 00:15:23,625
On this battlefield,
hunger isn't a weakness,

312
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,458
it's the source of our strength!

313
00:15:25,541 --> 00:15:28,416
Only those who hunger
for victory ever grasp it.

314
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:32,208
And with my hunger at its
peak, my power is unparalleled.

315
00:15:32,833 --> 00:15:35,458
Let's test that, shall we?

316
00:15:41,708 --> 00:15:43,333
[YARIZUI] It doesn't matter
how long you fast when

317
00:15:43,416 --> 00:15:45,583
your target isn't the
bento in the first place.

318
00:15:45,666 --> 00:15:47,000
Gnash your teeth all you like,

319
00:15:47,083 --> 00:15:49,958
but you're no Wolf if you
lose sight of your prey.

320
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:56,458
Feeling a little
sluggish, Monarch?

321
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:02,125
[YARIZUI] You're nothing
but a slobbering beast,

322
00:16:02,208 --> 00:16:04,875
gazing longingly at
butterflies in the sky.

323
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:07,750
A prideless rat that can't rise
up from the muck that blinds it.

324
00:16:07,833 --> 00:16:09,166
[ENDO] Shut up!

325
00:16:12,125 --> 00:16:13,291
[ENDO] I am the Monarch!

326
00:16:13,375 --> 00:16:16,375
The strongest Wolf that
has ever drawn breath!

327
00:16:21,208 --> 00:16:22,916
Your hunger is shallow
and meaningless.

328
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,083
You have no focus,
no conviction, or pride.

329
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:28,000
Which means you have
no hope to defeat us!

330
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:31,833
[ENDO] Dammit!

331
00:16:32,833 --> 00:16:34,333
Sato!

332
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:41,958
My leg!

333
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,708
This is the
hunger of a Wolf!

334
00:16:54,958 --> 00:16:57,250
[SATO] Wow.
We really did it.

335
00:16:57,333 --> 00:16:59,833
[SHAGA] Yeah. That wasn't
as bad as I thought.

336
00:16:59,916 --> 00:17:02,333
[YARIZUI] I agree.
You did well, you two.

337
00:17:03,625 --> 00:17:05,625
Hey, are you gonna
be able to make it home?

338
00:17:05,708 --> 00:17:08,833
Of course. I'm fine, but I
think I'm going to pass on

339
00:17:08,916 --> 00:17:11,541
fighting for the bento with
the seal this time around.

340
00:17:14,583 --> 00:17:15,791
[SATO] Wow.

341
00:17:17,833 --> 00:17:19,875
Well, what do you
think we should do?

342
00:17:19,958 --> 00:17:22,500
Come on.
It's obvious!

343
00:17:23,583 --> 00:17:24,875
It's mine.

344
00:17:24,958 --> 00:17:26,791
You wish, buddy!

345
00:17:34,041 --> 00:17:36,083
[OSHIROI] Yarizui, you're okay!

346
00:17:36,916 --> 00:17:39,791
[YARIZUI] Oshiroi?
How are things in the West?

347
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,125
[OSHIROI] We did great!

348
00:17:41,208 --> 00:17:43,791
I protected the shop
and got a bento!

349
00:17:45,125 --> 00:17:47,250
I see.
Congratulations, then.

350
00:17:47,333 --> 00:17:48,708
I grabbed one as well.

351
00:17:48,791 --> 00:17:50,666
[OSHIROI]
I'd expect nothing less!

352
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:52,833
Oh, but where's Sato?

353
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,208
[SHAGA] Hey, be careful, you're
gonna spill the hot water!

354
00:17:58,291 --> 00:18:00,875
[SATO] If you're gonna complain,
then walk on your own!

355
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,541
Oh, hey there, Oshiroi!
It was pretty tough this

356
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:07,375
time around, but here,
check this out.

357
00:18:07,750 --> 00:18:09,958
I got the one
with the seal!

358
00:18:15,833 --> 00:18:16,833
[MATSUBA] Finally awake?

359
00:18:18,125 --> 00:18:20,208
[NIKAIDO] What happened?
How did the battle go?

360
00:18:23,291 --> 00:18:24,375
[NIKAIDO] Endo.

361
00:18:24,458 --> 00:18:25,666
[MATSUBA] After you
were knocked out,

362
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,958
some of the Ice Witch's
allies came to help her.

363
00:18:28,041 --> 00:18:30,208
[NIKAIDO]
The Ice Witch's allies?

364
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:34,291
It was him.
That pervert, huh?

365
00:18:34,375 --> 00:18:35,541
[MATSUBA] I'm sorry.

366
00:18:35,625 --> 00:18:37,250
I suppose this is
something I should have

367
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:40,291
taken care of before
I retired as a Wolf.

368
00:18:40,916 --> 00:18:42,166
[NIKAIDO] We did
this on our own.

369
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:46,291
It's our fault.
Please don't apologize.

370
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,833
It's time for you
to live your life freely now.

371
00:18:48,916 --> 00:18:51,666
Gabriel Ratchet is disbanded.

372
00:18:57,166 --> 00:18:59,916
But now, I'm nothing
but a lowly Dog.

373
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,750
I haven't earned the
freedom I've been granted.

374
00:19:02,833 --> 00:19:04,583
[MATSUBA] Then like a
beast searching for a home,

375
00:19:04,666 --> 00:19:06,666
go wherever the wind takes you.

376
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,750
I'm sure you'll find
your way soon enough.

377
00:19:08,833 --> 00:19:10,750
I have faith in you.

378
00:19:11,375 --> 00:19:12,750
Macchan.

379
00:19:13,125 --> 00:19:14,791
[MATSUBA] Now go live your life.

380
00:19:15,416 --> 00:19:16,750
[NIKAIDO] Right.

381
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:33,000
[NIKAIDO] Farewell.
Monarch Butterfly.

382
00:19:38,625 --> 00:19:40,875
[SATO] Hey!
Cut it out! That's mine!

383
00:19:40,958 --> 00:19:42,875
[SHAGA] Who cares?
You're not even hungry, right?

384
00:19:42,958 --> 00:19:44,458
[SATO] Of course I am!

385
00:19:44,541 --> 00:19:47,166
And besides, if you'd just asked
nicely, I'd let you have some!

386
00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:49,708
[YARIZUI] Is that so?
Then I'll try some as well.

387
00:19:50,625 --> 00:19:53,375
No. Not you,
too? Man.

388
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:56,875
I've actually never
tried zangee karaage before,

389
00:19:56,958 --> 00:19:58,250
but it seems they marinate the

390
00:19:58,333 --> 00:20:00,166
chicken longer than
the usual kind.

391
00:20:00,250 --> 00:20:01,875
The flavor's truly exquisite.

392
00:20:01,958 --> 00:20:05,083
Well, that's nice.
But between the two of you,

393
00:20:05,166 --> 00:20:07,708
There's hardly any left for me.

394
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:14,333
[ALL] What a delicious meal!

395
00:20:15,958 --> 00:20:18,291
[SHAGA] I ate so
much I got sleepy.

396
00:20:19,125 --> 00:20:20,791
Hey, Shaga!

397
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:28,125
So, Sato, do you think
I'm a Wolf like you guys?

398
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:31,000
Hey, c'mon, what are
you talking about?

399
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:34,208
In the end, no matter
how hard I try,

400
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:35,666
it seems like you're
the one who always

401
00:20:35,750 --> 00:20:37,625
ends up with the best bentos.

402
00:20:37,708 --> 00:20:41,833
Also, I think I lose out to
the Ice Witch every time.

403
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,208
Whether you're
a Wolf or not...

404
00:20:44,291 --> 00:20:46,333
You're something
different than just a Dog.

405
00:20:46,416 --> 00:20:48,541
Something way more impressive.

406
00:20:50,958 --> 00:20:51,958
Ya think so?

407
00:20:52,041 --> 00:20:53,291
Uh-huh.

408
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:56,000
Seems like Oshiroi was
pretty amazing today, too.

409
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:58,041
Saito was held in
bondage by Shabriel Ratchet

410
00:20:58,125 --> 00:21:00,875
when the Anarch came before him,
baring absolutely everything--

411
00:21:05,041 --> 00:21:07,500
Jeez. I didn't think she
would fall asleep for real.

412
00:21:07,583 --> 00:21:09,541
She fought pretty
hard back there.

413
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:10,958
Let her rest for a while.

414
00:21:11,041 --> 00:21:12,166
'Kay.

415
00:21:15,333 --> 00:21:17,000
The Beauty by the Lake.

416
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,583
I'm a little bit jealous.

417
00:21:18,666 --> 00:21:21,083
It seems like she's already
become a wonderful Wolf.

418
00:21:21,166 --> 00:21:22,250
[YARIZUI] What are
you talking about?

419
00:21:22,333 --> 00:21:23,500
You two are no different.

420
00:21:23,583 --> 00:21:25,625
Soon you'll have your very
own nom de guerre.

421
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:26,916
The same as her.

422
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,500
Do you think so?

423
00:21:29,333 --> 00:21:31,000
My own title, huh?

424
00:21:31,083 --> 00:21:33,875
Man, I sure hope I
end up with a cool one.

425
00:21:35,208 --> 00:21:36,625
[SATO] This is
just the beginning.

426
00:21:36,708 --> 00:21:38,500
I'll keep growing stronger.

427
00:21:38,583 --> 00:21:43,041
I'll show my pride as a Wolf,
and earn my own legacy.
