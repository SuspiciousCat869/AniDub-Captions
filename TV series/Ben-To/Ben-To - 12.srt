1
00:00:13,958 --> 00:00:15,583
[SATO] Are you all right?

2
00:00:15,666 --> 00:00:17,250
[YARIZUI] What time is it?

3
00:00:17,333 --> 00:00:18,791
[SATO] It's almost six o'clock.

4
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:20,208
[YARIZUI] Seriously?

5
00:00:20,291 --> 00:00:22,000
The God of Discounts
at Super Audrey

6
00:00:22,083 --> 00:00:24,125
doesn't do his
markdowns until ten.

7
00:00:24,208 --> 00:00:25,833
I've still got time to sleep.

8
00:00:25,916 --> 00:00:28,958
I don't think it's a good
idea for you to go, Yarizui.

9
00:00:31,833 --> 00:00:35,000
[YARIZUI] It'll be fine, just
give me another hour or two.

10
00:00:35,083 --> 00:00:36,791
You know it's kinda funny.

11
00:00:37,375 --> 00:00:39,375
That eel is
exactly what I need.

12
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,666
If I ate some I
wouldn't be so tired.

13
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:45,250
My body could use the nutrients,
and I'm getting hungry.

14
00:00:45,333 --> 00:00:48,625
You would think that would
be enough to motivate me.

15
00:00:48,708 --> 00:00:54,583
I have to go defeat Orthros, and
get my hands on the eel bento.

16
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,291
You rest.

17
00:01:10,375 --> 00:01:13,000
And let me play
the hero for once.

18
00:01:22,875 --> 00:01:26,833
[door opens and closes]

19
00:01:33,375 --> 00:01:35,333
[opening song]

20
00:01:43,291 --> 00:01:45,250
[girl singing in Japanese]

21
00:03:09,208 --> 00:03:11,041
Man.

22
00:03:11,125 --> 00:03:13,458
Maybe I should just take
a break for a little while.

23
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:15,250
Nothing's coming to me.

24
00:03:15,333 --> 00:03:18,666
[OSHIROI] My laptop's
fixed and I get writer's block.

25
00:03:19,916 --> 00:03:22,458
I'm just gonna have to
fight my way through it!

26
00:03:26,541 --> 00:03:29,500
[sinister laughter]

27
00:03:41,291 --> 00:03:43,000
It's about time
for us to leave.

28
00:03:43,083 --> 00:03:44,083
Are you ready?

29
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:46,791
I'm just worried because
it's a Dog Day.

30
00:03:46,875 --> 00:03:49,916
What if he's waiting for us?

31
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,166
[SAWAGI VP] It's been
three years since then.

32
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:54,250
Please don't worry, Sis.

33
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:58,541
Yeah, I know, but--but
I can't help myself.

34
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:02,625
So wait.

35
00:04:02,708 --> 00:04:05,375
They moved because
of this Heracles guy?

36
00:04:06,166 --> 00:04:07,375
[NIKAIDO] Yeah.

37
00:04:07,458 --> 00:04:09,166
And according to my
sources, he's the one who

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,583
drove them out of
Yumehiro three years ago.

39
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:14,708
"Drove them out"?
What do you mean drove them out?

40
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:19,500
You've got to find a way
to save them somehow.

41
00:04:25,291 --> 00:04:27,541
[SAWAGI PRES] It looks
like it's going to rain.

42
00:04:33,791 --> 00:04:34,916
[SATO] I dunno.

43
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,750
[HERACLES] Aw c'mon,
what's the big deal?

44
00:04:36,833 --> 00:04:38,375
You said you wanna
get an eel bento

45
00:04:38,458 --> 00:04:40,708
for your sick friend
Yarizui, right?

46
00:04:40,791 --> 00:04:42,458
Do you or don't you?

47
00:04:42,541 --> 00:04:43,750
[SATO] Why're you doing this?

48
00:04:43,833 --> 00:04:46,375
[HERACLES] Do you
honestly think I'd tell you?

49
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,750
Whatever.

50
00:04:49,375 --> 00:04:51,166
[HERACLES] Give it
some thought, okay?

51
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,875
See ya.

52
00:04:55,375 --> 00:04:58,375
I could cry. Because
to me you're like--

53
00:05:00,625 --> 00:05:03,500
Go get me
an eel bento.

54
00:05:03,583 --> 00:05:05,708
Please, Sato.

55
00:05:08,416 --> 00:05:11,666
[SATO] If I don't stop thinking
about it, I'm gonna go crazy.

56
00:05:15,708 --> 00:05:18,083
You okay? Or do you
just want to go home?

57
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:21,375
[SAWAGI PRES] I'll be alright.
I can do this, I know I can.

58
00:05:21,458 --> 00:05:23,083
C'mon, let's go.

59
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,083
[BRUNETTE] Hey look.
It's the Pup.

60
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,875
[HERACLES] Figures he'd run.

61
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:38,458
[HERACLES]
So tell me somethin',

62
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:40,375
are you guys friends
with the Pervert?

63
00:05:49,458 --> 00:05:52,000
I've always been told
history repeats itself.

64
00:05:52,083 --> 00:05:54,750
I guess I'm about to
find out if that's true.

65
00:05:55,083 --> 00:05:57,583
[rain begins to pour]

66
00:05:57,666 --> 00:05:59,875
[HERACLES] That's just perfect.

67
00:06:05,916 --> 00:06:08,708
Ugh, this freakin' downpour
came outta nowhere!

68
00:06:09,166 --> 00:06:10,541
[SHAGA] Was that Sato?
[NIKAIDO] The Pervert?

69
00:06:10,625 --> 00:06:12,458
[SHAGA] Hey!
Where the hell are you going?

70
00:06:12,541 --> 00:06:15,000
Aw man.
What's gotten into that guy?

71
00:06:22,041 --> 00:06:24,541
[SHAGA] Oh man,
I am totally soaked!

72
00:06:35,583 --> 00:06:37,916
Is it just me or does
something feel off?

73
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:40,458
[NIKAIDO] They're here.

74
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:41,875
[SHAGA] Orthros!

75
00:06:42,875 --> 00:06:44,250
See? I knew it
was a good idea

76
00:06:44,333 --> 00:06:46,250
to go back home
and grab an umbrella.

77
00:06:46,333 --> 00:06:47,583
[SAWAGI VP] Yeah, it
would've been had we not

78
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:50,125
gotten completely
drenched on our way there.

79
00:06:55,125 --> 00:06:56,541
So, what's that smell?

80
00:06:56,625 --> 00:06:59,208
And does it seem like it's a
little smoky in here to you?

81
00:06:59,291 --> 00:07:00,708
[SAWAGI VP] If I had
to guess, I'd say it's

82
00:07:00,791 --> 00:07:02,458
probably from all the
eel they're grilling.

83
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:05,125
The store's ventilation
system can't--

84
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:06,791
[SAWAGI PRES] Watch it, Kyo!

85
00:07:06,875 --> 00:07:08,125
You should really
know better than to

86
00:07:08,208 --> 00:07:09,791
stop walking when
somebody's right behind you--

87
00:07:09,875 --> 00:07:11,333
It's him.

88
00:07:11,416 --> 00:07:14,458
Hey there, ladies.
Long time no see.

89
00:07:17,583 --> 00:07:18,708
I heard a rumor
that the two

90
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:20,916
of you had startled
bento brawling again.

91
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,875
At first I didn't believe it
'cause I thought you

92
00:07:22,958 --> 00:07:25,416
lost your taste for half-price
food a while back.

93
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,166
But surprise, surprise,
here you are!

94
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:30,208
I'm only gonna
give you one warning, girls.

95
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,958
Get the hell outta
here and go back into

96
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:34,666
retirement or I'll be forced
to destroy you again.

97
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,750
So what's it gonna be?

98
00:07:35,833 --> 00:07:37,000
Are you stayin' or goin'?

99
00:07:37,083 --> 00:07:38,583
As you know, I'm
not opposed to beating

100
00:07:38,666 --> 00:07:40,750
the crap outta lovely
ladies like you.

101
00:07:40,833 --> 00:07:44,125
If I were you, I'd get
outta here while I still can.

102
00:07:44,750 --> 00:07:47,416
This guy's tough.
Who is he anyway?

103
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,083
Heracles Combo.
It has to be.

104
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,333
[SATO] Heracles' Combo?

105
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:57,666
[HERACLES] That's me.

106
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:00,791
Well, kind of--I mean, that's
not my real name.

107
00:08:00,875 --> 00:08:02,291
It's just my nom de guerre.

108
00:08:02,375 --> 00:08:04,416
[SATO] So you're a Wolf, too?

109
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,791
[HERACLES] I have
something I need to ask you.

110
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:09,458
Nuh-uh.

111
00:08:09,541 --> 00:08:10,791
We're going to stay.

112
00:08:10,875 --> 00:08:12,000
[HERACLES] Are you sure?

113
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:13,583
Because I've already
talked to all the Wolves

114
00:08:13,666 --> 00:08:15,375
here and they're on my side now.

115
00:08:15,458 --> 00:08:18,500
I told 'em what happened
three years ago and they agreed.

116
00:08:18,583 --> 00:08:20,875
[HERACLES] Things would go
smoother without you two here.

117
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,166
[SAWAGI PRES]
I don't understand.

118
00:08:22,250 --> 00:08:24,375
Why're you doing
this to us again?

119
00:08:24,458 --> 00:08:26,041
[HERACLES] You kiddin' me?

120
00:08:26,125 --> 00:08:28,375
I thought I told
you this the last time.

121
00:08:28,458 --> 00:08:30,500
You're too strong
for your own good.

122
00:08:30,583 --> 00:08:32,250
[HERACLES] It disrupts
the food chain, y'know?

123
00:08:32,333 --> 00:08:34,125
It's impossible for us
to have a fair brawl

124
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:36,291
as long as you two are around.

125
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:37,916
Just give up, Orthros.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,208
There's no hope
for the two of you.

127
00:08:40,708 --> 00:08:42,041
No!

128
00:08:42,125 --> 00:08:43,500
We're not gonna give up on
the brawl because of you!

129
00:08:43,583 --> 00:08:45,000
It's not over!

130
00:08:45,083 --> 00:08:47,166
Somebody will come forward
and offer to fight alongside us.

131
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:48,791
You'll see!

132
00:08:48,875 --> 00:08:49,833
I bet the Ice Witch

133
00:08:49,916 --> 00:08:51,458
and the Pervert will help us!

134
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,833
[HERACLES]
The Pervert?

135
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:56,291
Oh yeah, you're talking
about that Yo Sato kid, huh?

136
00:08:56,375 --> 00:08:58,500
I saw him outside
but he ran off.

137
00:09:06,208 --> 00:09:07,458
[BENTO BRAWLER 5L] Seriously?

138
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:08,791
[BENTO BRAWLER 1J]
The Pervert ditched the brawl?

139
00:09:08,875 --> 00:09:09,750
[BENTO BRAWLER 1P]
Do you guys think he

140
00:09:09,833 --> 00:09:11,875
was scared of Heracles' Combo?

141
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,958
[SHAGA] Sato ran off?

142
00:09:14,041 --> 00:09:15,625
But that's not like him.

143
00:09:16,583 --> 00:09:17,583
[HERACLES] Okay, fine.

144
00:09:17,666 --> 00:09:20,041
Go ahead and wait
if you want to.

145
00:09:20,125 --> 00:09:21,291
[HERACLES] 
Listen up...

146
00:09:21,375 --> 00:09:23,291
If you wanna rid
yourselves of Orthros once

147
00:09:23,375 --> 00:09:26,125
and for all, you're
gonna have to cooperate.

148
00:09:26,791 --> 00:09:28,041
[HERACLES] What do
you do with a nail that

149
00:09:28,125 --> 00:09:30,666
sticks out too far
to pound down?

150
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:34,333
Any guesses?
I'll tell ya.

151
00:09:34,416 --> 00:09:36,250
You yank it out!

152
00:09:36,333 --> 00:09:38,208
Like I did
three years ago.

153
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:39,583
Huh?

154
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:46,750
Oh. Hi.
How're you tonight?

155
00:09:46,833 --> 00:09:48,041
I'm not too bad.

156
00:09:48,125 --> 00:09:49,833
I can't believe
you came out again.

157
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,166
You really put
everything you got

158
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:52,416
into these bento brawls, huh?

159
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,583
Yeah, of course we do!

160
00:09:53,666 --> 00:09:54,916
Maybe you'll be able
to beat us tonight.

161
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,125
Yeah.

162
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:01,916
I'm about to destroy
your world, ladies.

163
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,041
[SAWAGI VP] Sis.
What's going on?

164
00:10:05,958 --> 00:10:08,208
Look, I've had just about
enough of you two.

165
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:09,875
You both win every single night.

166
00:10:09,958 --> 00:10:12,250
Nobody else even
stands a chance,

167
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:15,333
and we always get stuck
with your leftovers.

168
00:10:15,416 --> 00:10:16,541
[HERACLES]
I thought you'd eventually get

169
00:10:16,625 --> 00:10:18,375
bored but I was wrong.

170
00:10:18,458 --> 00:10:21,041
The thing is, we don't wanna
brawl with you anymore.

171
00:10:21,125 --> 00:10:24,458
So how about you grab the bento
you want and get the hell out.

172
00:10:24,875 --> 00:10:26,166
[HERACLES] What's the matter?

173
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:28,458
You girls came here for
half-price food, didn't you?

174
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,000
Go ahead.

175
00:10:30,083 --> 00:10:31,750
[BENTO BRAWLER 12A]
Hurry up and take 'em already!

176
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:32,958
[BENTO BRAWLER 12B]
Yeah, we can't start the

177
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:34,625
brawl until you
twerps are gone.

178
00:10:34,708 --> 00:10:37,041
[BENTO BRAWLER 12C] C'mon!
We ain't got all night!

179
00:10:50,875 --> 00:10:52,666
Ya see?
This is more like it!

180
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:55,875
We can finally have a fair
fight without you around!

181
00:10:56,500 --> 00:10:58,833
[HERACLES] 
And don't come crawling back.

182
00:10:58,916 --> 00:11:01,416
'Cause I won't
let that happen. 'Kay?

183
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,666
[NIKAIDO] So that's
how he drove 'em off.

184
00:11:15,750 --> 00:11:17,833
[SHAGA] He's a
heartless bastard.

[doors open]

[GOD OF DISCOUNTS 12A]
All right! Who's ready

187
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,666
for half-priced bento?

188
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:26,041
If so, you'd better act fast
'cause it won't last long.

189
00:11:26,125 --> 00:11:27,375
You're not gonna be able to find

190
00:11:27,458 --> 00:11:30,208
this kinda quality any
cheaper, that's for sure!

191
00:11:30,291 --> 00:11:32,000
[GOD OF DISCOUNTS 12A]
Only a few minutes left.

192
00:11:32,083 --> 00:11:35,791
And then it's an all out war
for half-price eel bento!

193
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,875
[HERACLES]
What are you waiting for?

194
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,041
You can go ahead and
get your dinner, Orthros.

195
00:11:40,125 --> 00:11:41,416
We'll wait right here.

196
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:43,958
You should know
the drill by now.

197
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,208
Hey, Sis? Can we
just take one and go?

198
00:11:48,291 --> 00:11:49,708
Please?

199
00:11:49,791 --> 00:11:51,666
[SAWAGI PRES] I guess
that's all we can do now.

200
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:54,625
I'm so sorry I keep dragging
you into trouble like this, Kyo.

201
00:11:54,708 --> 00:11:56,333
I didn't mean to.

202
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,125
[SAWAGI VP] I know, Sis.

203
00:12:02,833 --> 00:12:04,250
Hey you!

204
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,125
Way to go!

205
00:12:07,208 --> 00:12:09,333
Y'know, for a second there,
I was worried you might

206
00:12:09,416 --> 00:12:13,166
try to rebel, but I'm glad to
see you made the right choi--

207
00:12:16,166 --> 00:12:17,916
[HERACLES] It's you.

208
00:12:20,458 --> 00:12:22,000
Sato!

209
00:12:46,916 --> 00:12:47,916
[ALL] Ben-To!

210
00:12:49,291 --> 00:12:50,750
[OSHIROI] At the Super Bawdry,
where the stage is

211
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:53,791
set for a test of manly muscle,
Nick Kaido waited patiently.

212
00:12:53,875 --> 00:12:56,166
[OSHIROI] Deep down he knew that
Saito, his partner in more ways

213
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:58,291
than one, was the only person
who could avert this crisis.

214
00:12:58,375 --> 00:12:59,333
"He's our last hope.

215
00:12:59,416 --> 00:13:02,708
If he can't stop this,
no one can!"

216
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:03,916
[OSHIROI] However,
it was obvious that

217
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,041
Saito wasn't his
usual manly self.

218
00:13:06,125 --> 00:13:09,083
He was gasping for air and
soaked in ice-cold sweat.

219
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,000
[OSHIROI] As he turned
to look at the girls,

220
00:13:11,083 --> 00:13:13,666
his gaze spoke clearer
than his words ever could.

221
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,291
[OSHIROI] "I'm sorry but
I can't pull myself

222
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:18,291
away from this
manly world for you!"

223
00:13:27,583 --> 00:13:28,958
[OSHIROI] What's wrong with me?

224
00:13:29,041 --> 00:13:31,833
Why can't I write
decent dialogue?

225
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,791
[SHAGA] Sato!
Do something!

226
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,750
[HERACLES] Don't ever
show your faces here again.

227
00:13:38,833 --> 00:13:40,250
Got it, Orthros?

228
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,500
[GOD OF DISCOUNTS 12A]
And to top it all off,

229
00:13:41,583 --> 00:13:43,708
the laurel wreath seal!

230
00:13:44,041 --> 00:13:45,750
Laurel wreath seal?

231
00:13:47,083 --> 00:13:48,583
[SAWAGI PRES] I want that bento.

232
00:13:48,666 --> 00:13:50,750
Nothing else
can satisfy my hunger.

233
00:13:50,833 --> 00:13:51,750
[SAWAGI VP]
What do you mean, Sis?

234
00:13:51,833 --> 00:13:53,958
Life is too short
to live in fear.

235
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:57,041
I say we show Heracles'
Combo we're not afraid.

236
00:13:57,125 --> 00:14:00,083
[SAWAGI PRES] If nothing else,
at least we can say we tried.

237
00:14:00,916 --> 00:14:02,250
Yeah, okay.

238
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,208
Sorry if this seems
selfish to you.

239
00:14:04,291 --> 00:14:06,041
I don't think you're
being selfish at all.

240
00:14:06,125 --> 00:14:08,833
In fact, this is ultimately
what's best for the both of us.

241
00:14:08,916 --> 00:14:12,000
We're Orthros, remember?
An unstoppable team.

242
00:14:12,083 --> 00:14:13,958
It's us against the world.

243
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,708
We can do this, Kyo.

244
00:14:54,125 --> 00:14:55,500
[HERACLES]
You want the laurel wreath?

245
00:14:55,583 --> 00:14:57,458
Go ahead and take it.

246
00:15:00,375 --> 00:15:03,750
[NIKAIDO] I can't believe
he's just offering it to them.

247
00:15:04,333 --> 00:15:06,125
If only we had more time,
maybe I could've

248
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,875
convinced everybody
else to stand up to him.

249
00:15:08,958 --> 00:15:10,916
[SATO] It smells so good.

250
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:12,375
Wait.
Huh?

251
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,375
After this,

252
00:15:18,458 --> 00:15:19,666
you and I may never
be noble Wolves again.

253
00:15:19,750 --> 00:15:21,125
I know.

254
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:27,250
Hey! You've gotta
go help them, Sato!

255
00:15:37,125 --> 00:15:39,458
Fine. If you
won't, I will!

256
00:15:39,541 --> 00:15:40,375
What?

257
00:15:40,458 --> 00:15:41,916
[SATO] Be patient, Shaga.

258
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,583
Real wolves have a different
way of communicating.

259
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:47,875
We don't need words.
You'll see.

260
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:51,541
This is all we need!

261
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:55,333
[HERACLES] What the--?

to work up an appetite!

265
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,833
It didn't take me long to
figure out what I had to do.

266
00:16:19,375 --> 00:16:20,541
See?

267
00:16:20,625 --> 00:16:22,333
When one stomach growls,
the others take notice.

268
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:25,625
Luckily, we've got half-price
bento right in front of us.

269
00:16:26,875 --> 00:16:29,833
And we've got the
instincts of a Wolf!

270
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,000
[SAWAGI PRES AND VP]
He did this for us?

271
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:41,291
Thank you, Pervert.

272
00:16:41,375 --> 00:16:44,291
What the hell're you doing?
Stop fighting!

273
00:16:44,375 --> 00:16:46,833
I thought you were with me; but
you're screwing up my plan!

274
00:16:46,916 --> 00:16:48,250
Knock it off!

275
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:49,958
[SATO] 'Cause you're
nothin' more than a bully!

276
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,083
[BRUNETTE] The Pup's right,

277
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:52,416
why should we waste
our time with you?

278
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:53,541
I'm embarrassed
we went along

279
00:16:53,625 --> 00:16:56,541
with your stupid plan
as long as we did!

280
00:16:56,916 --> 00:16:58,833
You'll never be able
to truly appreciate the taste

281
00:16:58,916 --> 00:17:00,666
of your half-price
bento if you force the

282
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:02,916
strongest wolves
out of the brawl.

283
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,750
[HERACLES] You bastards
think you're so smart.

284
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:09,541
It looks like you've left me
with no other choice.

285
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,458
I'll just have to beat
the ever-loving-crap

286
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:12,958
out of all of you!

287
00:17:13,041 --> 00:17:15,291
You'd better get ready,
'cause you're about

288
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:17,791
to feel the wrath of
Heracles' Combo!

289
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:20,208
[HERACLES] You asked for it!

290
00:17:24,375 --> 00:17:26,833
[SATO] Heads up,
Heracles' Combo!

291
00:17:26,916 --> 00:17:29,291
[HERACLES] You've gotta yank
the nail that sticks out too far

292
00:17:29,375 --> 00:17:31,958
or they're never gonna
learn their lesson!

293
00:17:33,166 --> 00:17:34,833
I don't think so, pal.

294
00:17:34,916 --> 00:17:36,958
There's another
way to fix that nail.

295
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:39,791
You get a bigger hammer!

296
00:17:39,875 --> 00:17:41,166
What's that mean?

297
00:17:42,541 --> 00:17:44,916
You get strong
enough to beat 'em!

298
00:17:45,583 --> 00:17:47,208
Whatever.
There's no way!

299
00:17:47,291 --> 00:17:48,083
Oh yeah?

300
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:49,208
Well, if there's anyone here who

301
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:51,958
can beat Orthros,
it's gotta be Sato!

302
00:17:52,375 --> 00:17:54,416
[NIKAIDO] Right?
Don't mess with the Pervert!

303
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:57,125
He's a lot stronger
than you think!

304
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,166
All right, Perv,
you ready to do this?

305
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:08,125
[SATO AND NIKAIDO] Yeah!
You're goin' down, Orthros!

306
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,333
You think we should?

307
00:18:11,416 --> 00:18:14,833
Well. Yeah! I do.

308
00:18:14,916 --> 00:18:18,375
We came close to losing it all.
I'm so glad we didn't.

309
00:18:18,458 --> 00:18:20,000
And it's all thanks to them!

310
00:18:20,083 --> 00:18:22,000
[HERACLES] Damn you!

311
00:18:25,375 --> 00:18:28,375
Okay, Orthros!
Get out there!

312
00:18:28,458 --> 00:18:30,125
You guys want
the laurel wreath seal?

313
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:31,375
Then you have to fight for it!

314
00:18:31,458 --> 00:18:33,083
[stomach growls]

315
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,208
[SATO] C'mon!

316
00:18:45,416 --> 00:18:47,500
[SAWAGI PRES AND VP]
Excuse us, you're in the way.

317
00:18:47,958 --> 00:18:49,541
[SAWAGI PRES] So hey, Kyo.

318
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:50,875
[SAWAGI VP] Yeah, Sis?

319
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:52,291
[SAWAGI PRES] Whaddya say
we show these awesome--

320
00:18:52,375 --> 00:18:55,500
I mean, these pathetic brawlers
the power of Orthros?

321
00:18:55,583 --> 00:18:57,208
[SAWAGI VP] I'm all for it!

322
00:19:03,750 --> 00:19:06,041
[OSHIROI] I'm so hungry
I can't concentrate anymore.

323
00:19:06,125 --> 00:19:08,125
I wonder if Sato's still here.

324
00:19:09,416 --> 00:19:10,750
[NIKAIDO] It's all
or nothing now!

325
00:19:10,833 --> 00:19:11,958
[SATO] There're only six left!

326
00:19:12,041 --> 00:19:13,166
[SAWAGI PRES]
You can have the other five

327
00:19:13,250 --> 00:19:15,083
but the laurel wreath
bento is all mine!

328
00:19:15,166 --> 00:19:16,625
[SAWAGI VP] Calm down, Kyo!

329
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,125
[SHAGA] You ladies are gonna
have to fight a lot harder than

330
00:19:18,208 --> 00:19:20,833
that or you're not getting
any half-price food!

331
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,708
[BRUNETTE] This is
delicious! For real!

332
00:19:29,791 --> 00:19:33,541
This has to be the best eel
bento I've ever had in my life.

333
00:19:34,875 --> 00:19:36,500
It's still so freakin' hot!

334
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:37,958
I don't know what
they do to their sauce

335
00:19:38,041 --> 00:19:39,000
but it's the best.

336
00:19:39,083 --> 00:19:40,875
Oh wow, this is yummy!

337
00:19:42,291 --> 00:19:43,625
[BRUNETTE] And how is yours?

338
00:19:43,708 --> 00:19:45,833
[SAWAGI VP AND PRES] Uh.
Well, it's pretty good, I guess.

339
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,083
[NIKAIDO] Orthros.

340
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,333
I was really impressed
by your tenacity.

341
00:19:50,416 --> 00:19:51,333
Nice work tonight.

342
00:19:51,416 --> 00:19:52,708
[SAWAGI PRES] Thanks.

343
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:54,333
We had a lot of fun brawling
with you guys tonight.

344
00:19:54,416 --> 00:19:55,541
Let's do it again soon.

345
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:57,833
And next time, we'll win.

346
00:19:57,916 --> 00:19:58,875
[BRUNETTE] Hey.

347
00:19:58,958 --> 00:19:59,916
The Pup's not here,
where'd he go?

348
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:01,583
He left as soon as
the brawl ended;

349
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:04,208
said he needed to see the Ice
Witch about his punishment.

350
00:20:04,291 --> 00:20:05,208
[SHAGA] Huh?

351
00:20:05,291 --> 00:20:06,333
[GOATEE]
The Pervert's a masochist?

352
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:07,916
[MONK] I believe it.

353
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:09,458
[SAWAGI PRES] Nikaido, I'm kinda
surprised you're not with him.

354
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:11,833
I thought "the two dumb
dogs" were inseparable.

355
00:20:11,916 --> 00:20:13,250
[NIKAIDO] Me and the Pervert?
No way!

356
00:20:13,333 --> 00:20:14,833
Now stop calling us that!

357
00:20:14,916 --> 00:20:17,125
Do you really think
she's gonna be upset, Sato?

358
00:20:17,208 --> 00:20:19,083
You are such a moron.

359
00:20:22,208 --> 00:20:23,583
[YARIZUI] Well?
How did it go?

360
00:20:23,666 --> 00:20:26,041
[SATO] May I present
the laurel wreath seal.

361
00:20:26,875 --> 00:20:28,583
[YARIZUI] I can't
believe you did it.

362
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,916
You never cease to amaze me.

363
00:20:31,416 --> 00:20:34,000
[YARIZUI] Sato. In
your letter you said

364
00:20:34,083 --> 00:20:36,500
sick people deserve
to be looked after.

365
00:20:36,583 --> 00:20:38,125
What can I do to thank you?

366
00:20:38,208 --> 00:20:40,250
I appreciate you
taking care of me.

367
00:20:40,333 --> 00:20:42,041
How about you give
me half the bento?

368
00:20:42,125 --> 00:20:43,083
Fine.

369
00:20:43,166 --> 00:20:44,708
If that's what
you want, so be it.

370
00:20:44,791 --> 00:20:47,291
Now.
You ready to dig in?

371
00:20:54,375 --> 00:20:56,041
[SATO] You take the first bite.

372
00:20:56,125 --> 00:20:57,958
But you're the one
who won the bento.

373
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,250
You should take the first bite.

374
00:20:59,333 --> 00:21:00,666
But--

375
00:21:00,750 --> 00:21:03,250
Go on, it's only fair.
But please give thanks first.

376
00:21:03,333 --> 00:21:04,541
'Kay.

377
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:06,500
Thanks for the food.

378
00:21:06,958 --> 00:21:09,083
[SATO] Whoa, it's so tender!

379
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,541
So how does it taste?

380
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:17,291
It's perfect.

381
00:21:17,375 --> 00:21:18,541
And what makes you say that?

382
00:21:18,625 --> 00:21:20,041
Well, it's hard to explain.

383
00:21:20,125 --> 00:21:22,416
This eel is so incredibly
delicious that while the taste

384
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,666
of it is still lingering in
my mouth, I almost don't even

385
00:21:24,750 --> 00:21:28,166
want to open it to speak for
fear I might lose the flavor.

386
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:31,333
It's that good?
I can't wait to try it!

387
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,333
Thanks for the food.

388
00:21:38,666 --> 00:21:41,500
This is, by far, the best
eel I've ever tasted.

389
00:21:41,583 --> 00:21:43,208
I don't know how you
got your hands on this

390
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,625
but I'm glad you did.

391
00:21:44,708 --> 00:21:47,166
To be honest with you,
there was so much going

392
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:50,000
on tonight that I'm not sure
how it happened either.

393
00:21:50,625 --> 00:21:53,083
But there's one thing I do know.

394
00:21:53,166 --> 00:21:54,583
Be they weak or strong,

395
00:21:54,666 --> 00:21:58,375
everybody deserves the
chance to brawl for bento.

396
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:00,333
I couldn't agree more.

397
00:22:00,416 --> 00:22:02,916
No one should be
judged by their skill level.

398
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,458
That would make things boring.

399
00:22:04,541 --> 00:22:07,416
I think the more brawlers
there are the more fun it is.

400
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:08,375
Don't you?

401
00:22:08,458 --> 00:22:09,583
[SATO] Yep!

402
00:22:09,666 --> 00:22:11,250
So to fill you in on
what happened tonight,

403
00:22:11,333 --> 00:22:14,250
there are these two
Wolves called Orthros.

404
00:22:14,958 --> 00:22:16,916
[closing song]
[girl singing in Japanese]

405
00:22:20,666 --> 00:22:22,583
[YARIZUI] Let's go!
Hurry, guys!

406
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,125
[SATO] What's the rush?

407
00:22:24,208 --> 00:22:27,375
[OSHIROI] Wait up, Yarizui!
My legs are shorter than yours!
