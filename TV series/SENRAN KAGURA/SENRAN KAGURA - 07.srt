00:07:40,083 --> 00:07:41,208
But, why can't we just go on

159
00:07:41,291 --> 00:07:43,000
a peaceful nature walk instead?

160
00:07:43,083 --> 00:07:45,708
I'll protect you, there's
nothing to worry about.

161
00:07:45,791 --> 00:07:47,875
Okay. I can handle this.

162
00:07:47,958 --> 00:07:49,125
Ready, go!

163
00:07:49,208 --> 00:07:50,583
[ALL] Right!

164
00:07:52,041 --> 00:07:53,541
[CAT] While we may
not know the evil ninja's

165
00:07:53,625 --> 00:07:55,000
true intentions,

166
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:57,875
it's obvious those five are
a part of their objective.

167
00:07:57,958 --> 00:07:59,833
They're special students
and they possess qualities

168
00:07:59,916 --> 00:08:01,416
worthy of merit.

169
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:03,583
But the fact that they have yet
to reach their full potential

170
00:08:03,666 --> 00:08:06,458
has you worried,
doesn't it, Sensei?

171
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:11,250
Aw man, we've barely started

172
00:08:11,333 --> 00:08:13,291
and this is already
ridiculously hard!

173
00:08:13,375 --> 00:08:15,750
One. Two. Three!

174
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:18,458
[ASUKA] Ninja Art
Flying Squirrel Flight!

175
00:08:20,416 --> 00:08:22,458
[NARRATOR] Ninja Art
Flying Squirrel Flight.

176
00:08:22,541 --> 00:08:24,791
A technique in which
a shinobi uses a woven drape

177
00:08:24,875 --> 00:08:26,791
as a glide wing to get
to the ground quickly from

178
00:08:26,875 --> 00:08:28,125
an elevated position.

179
00:08:28,208 --> 00:08:30,208
And it's great for panty shots.

180
00:08:30,291 --> 00:08:32,375
Real nice... landing.

181
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,875
[ASUKA] I wonder how
everyone else is holding up.

182
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:38,208
[IKARUGA] Wow.

183
00:08:38,291 --> 00:08:39,833
I've still got a ways to go.

184
00:08:39,916 --> 00:08:41,541
[KIRIYA] It's nearly
impossible to reach the summit

185
00:08:41,625 --> 00:08:43,041
of the mountain in one day.

186
00:08:43,125 --> 00:08:44,875
Remember, if you don't
conserve your energy,

187
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:47,166
it could cost you your life.

188
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:50,666
Yep. I'm definitely gonna
be the first to the top.

189
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:55,791
[KIRIYA] So please make sure
you get enough rest overnight.

190
00:08:55,875 --> 00:08:57,500
Ow!

191
00:08:57,583 --> 00:09:00,375
[KIRIYA] I promise this training
will make you stronger.

192
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,500
I've gotta find Hibari
before I do anything.

193
00:09:03,583 --> 00:09:05,833
[ASUKA] Uh. It's so hot.

194
00:09:08,291 --> 00:09:10,416
[ASUKA] Let's give
the girls a little air.

195
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:14,666
Ahhh!

196
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:16,541
It's so freakin'
cold. If I'm not careful

197
00:09:16,625 --> 00:09:18,916
I might freeze
off my love muffins!

198
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:21,791
[roar]

199
00:09:21,875 --> 00:09:23,625
What the hell?

200
00:09:27,416 --> 00:09:30,250
I feel like the wind's
going to blow me away!

201
00:09:30,333 --> 00:09:32,958
[hiss]

202
00:09:33,041 --> 00:09:34,416
Ah!

203
00:09:37,791 --> 00:09:39,666
She's got to be
around here somewhere.

204
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:42,541
[YAGYU] Uh...?

205
00:09:44,666 --> 00:09:45,791
[YAGYU] Oh no!

206
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:51,291
Teimapaku is no ordinary
mountain, that's for sure!

207
00:09:51,375 --> 00:09:53,083
[KIRIYA] But even so,
I trust you girls.

208
00:09:53,166 --> 00:09:55,000
And I know you can handle it!

209
00:09:55,083 --> 00:09:56,541
[NARRATOR] Teimapaku.

210
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:58,583
A special training area where
countless contrivances have

211
00:09:58,666 --> 00:10:02,041
been put in place to plunge
trainees into severe conditions.

212
00:10:02,125 --> 00:10:04,125
[hiss]

213
00:10:04,208 --> 00:10:05,625
I'm not sure why,
but I'm getting

214
00:10:05,708 --> 00:10:07,833
a really bad
vibe from this snake!

215
00:10:07,916 --> 00:10:09,708
[Asuka breathing heavy]

216
00:10:09,791 --> 00:10:13,166
Ahhh!

217
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,375
Ahhh!

218
00:10:27,291 --> 00:10:28,166
[ASUKA] An eel?

219
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,333
It has whiskers.

220
00:10:29,416 --> 00:10:31,666
Wait, eels don't
have whiskers, do they?

221
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,333
What in the name of
everything holy is this?

222
00:10:34,416 --> 00:10:37,750
[ASUKA] Well, whatever
you are, you're goin' down!

223
00:10:41,708 --> 00:10:44,000
I'm sorry mister fish monster.

224
00:10:44,875 --> 00:10:46,916
Hey. Stop it!

225
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,708
[hiss]

226
00:10:48,791 --> 00:10:50,416
No, means no!

227
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,541
Who's my little punk bitch?

228
00:10:53,625 --> 00:10:55,125
[POLAR BEAR] I am.

229
00:10:58,083 --> 00:10:59,541
That's right.
All of you bears better

230
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:01,000
think twice before you step up

231
00:11:01,083 --> 00:11:03,125
[KATSURAGI] to Hanzo's
number one shinobi!

232
00:11:03,208 --> 00:11:04,708
[breathing heavy]

233
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,875
[sneeze]

234
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:09,791
[KATSURAGI] I need to stop
talkin' smack and put on some

235
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,875
freakin' clothes or I'm
gonna catch a cold out here.

236
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:16,500
Change clothes!

237
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,000
A sumo costume?

238
00:11:20,875 --> 00:11:23,916
Well, if it keeps
me warm, who cares?

239
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,958
It's heavy! It's so heavy!

240
00:11:27,041 --> 00:11:28,416
Using my weapon
to get my footing

241
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,958
was not a smart choice.

242
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:32,083
Now I can't even defend myself!

243
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,250
Yagyu!

244
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,666
Hibari! Stay back!

245
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:35,708
Are those gold fish?

246
00:11:35,791 --> 00:11:37,208
No, they're
flesh-eating piranhas.

247
00:11:37,291 --> 00:11:38,541
Oh. That's not good.

248
00:11:38,625 --> 00:11:40,916
[YAGYU] Don't worry about
me, you just keep going!

249
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,458
No way!

250
00:11:42,541 --> 00:11:45,166
[HIBARI] This time, I'm the one
who's going to protect you!

251
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,000
Hibari.

252
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:49,250
Secret Ninja Art!

253
00:11:51,666 --> 00:11:53,791
Ninja Bunny Boom!

254
00:11:54,833 --> 00:11:56,208
Take my hand!

255
00:11:59,541 --> 00:12:01,875
[HIBARI] Thanks for
the lift, Mr. Bunny!

256
00:12:03,291 --> 00:12:05,166
That sure was
a close call, huh?

257
00:12:05,250 --> 00:12:06,916
[YAGYU] I thought the river
would be the safest route

258
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,750
but it appears I was
wrong about that.

259
00:12:08,833 --> 00:12:11,875
I'm lucky those stupid fish
didn't eat more than my clothes.

260
00:12:11,958 --> 00:12:12,625
Hibari?

261
00:12:12,708 --> 00:12:14,208
Yeah, what's up?

262
00:12:14,291 --> 00:12:15,291
Thanks.

263
00:12:15,375 --> 00:12:16,791
You saved my life.

264
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,250
Oh no, your
breasts are in danger!

265
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,625
Ugh!

266
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:26,125
Take that, you jerk!

267
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:28,291
Now it's time to
go get the scroll!

268
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,666
It's getting pretty late.
I'd better make camp

269
00:12:41,750 --> 00:12:43,375
and try to get some rest.

270
00:12:44,791 --> 00:12:45,750
Who's there?

271
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:48,000
Wait, hold on!
It's me, Katsuragi!

272
00:12:48,083 --> 00:12:50,625
What happened? You got fat.

273
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,833
[IKARUGA] So you really
wrestled a polar bear?

274
00:12:53,916 --> 00:12:54,875
[KATSURAGI] Oh yeah.

275
00:12:54,958 --> 00:12:56,708
I totally dominated him, too.

276
00:12:56,791 --> 00:12:58,791
Well, this is supposed
to make us stronger.

277
00:12:58,875 --> 00:12:59,791
Yeah, yeah.

278
00:12:59,875 --> 00:13:01,000
[stomach growl]

279
00:13:01,083 --> 00:13:02,500
It's just that I'm so hungry.

280
00:13:02,583 --> 00:13:04,000
[IKARUGA] You amateur.

281
00:13:04,083 --> 00:13:06,125
Securing a food supply should
have been your first move.

282
00:13:06,208 --> 00:13:07,583
[IKARUGA] Here.

283
00:13:08,375 --> 00:13:10,208
[KATSURAGI] Whoa,
where'd you get acorns?

284
00:13:10,291 --> 00:13:12,583
I gathered them while
I was making my way up.

285
00:13:12,666 --> 00:13:14,333
[KATSURAGI] Sure you don't
mind sharing with me?

286
00:13:14,416 --> 00:13:15,625
Not at all.

287
00:13:15,708 --> 00:13:17,583
Thanks a lot! Leave
it to our class chairman!

288
00:13:17,666 --> 00:13:19,208
Not sure why
you're being so nice.

289
00:13:19,291 --> 00:13:21,375
But I gotta say, I do
prefer your generous side

290
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:22,333
to your bitchy one.

291
00:13:22,416 --> 00:13:23,916
I'll take that as a compliment.

292
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,541
Now shut up and eat already.

293
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:27,541
Hey, don't start
ordering me around!

294
00:13:27,625 --> 00:13:29,541
But since you offered,
I guess I'll help myself!

295
00:13:29,625 --> 00:13:31,125
Oh, I almost forgot.

296
00:13:31,208 --> 00:13:33,750
I found a nice hot spring just a
little farther up the mountain.

297
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:35,541
Seriously?

298
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:37,666
[IKARUGA] I wonder
if the other girls

299
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,041
are making it
okay out here.

300
00:13:39,125 --> 00:13:40,875
I'm sure they're
all doing fine.

301
00:13:40,958 --> 00:13:42,541
[Ikaruga chuckle]
[KATSURAGI] What's so funny?

302
00:13:42,625 --> 00:13:44,750
Nothing, just reminiscing
about the old days.

303
00:13:44,833 --> 00:13:46,208
Huh?

304
00:13:46,291 --> 00:13:48,791
I was thinking about when
we first enrolled at Hanzo.

305
00:13:48,875 --> 00:13:51,875
It was only the two of us,
kinda like right now.

306
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:53,666
[KATSURAGI] Yeah.

307
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:54,875
I guess you're right.

308
00:13:54,958 --> 00:13:56,875
Those were the days.

309
00:13:58,333 --> 00:13:59,875
[both chuckle]

310
00:14:00,791 --> 00:14:03,958
[Yagyu grunting]

311
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,250
Wow!

312
00:14:08,791 --> 00:14:11,291
[HIBARI] This spring
water pool is awesome!

313
00:14:11,375 --> 00:14:13,333
It's as good a
place as any to clean up.

314
00:14:13,416 --> 00:14:15,083
It's way safer
than the stupid river.

315
00:14:15,166 --> 00:14:18,208
Yeah, I don't see any flesh
eating fishies over here.

316
00:14:19,125 --> 00:14:20,291
[YAGYU] Thanks
again for earlier.

317
00:14:20,375 --> 00:14:21,541
Huh?

318
00:14:21,625 --> 00:14:23,375
It seems all I ever
do is worry about you.

319
00:14:23,458 --> 00:14:25,041
And yet, you're the one
who just rescued me

320
00:14:25,125 --> 00:14:26,958
from a school of
deadly piranhas.

321
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:27,958
[YAGYU] You're
a lot more skilled

322
00:14:28,041 --> 00:14:29,875
than I give you credit for.

323
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,125
[HIBARI] It's not like I really
did anything special back there.

324
00:14:34,208 --> 00:14:36,125
My body just reacted
on its own without

325
00:14:36,208 --> 00:14:37,791
me even thinking about it.

326
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:40,583
Besides, I like you
looking after me.

327
00:14:41,625 --> 00:14:43,666
Good, I'm glad to hear it.

328
00:14:46,291 --> 00:14:49,166
It sure is nice being
out here all on my own.

329
00:14:50,208 --> 00:14:51,958
[HOMURA] You're not fit to call
yourself the granddaughter

330
00:14:52,041 --> 00:14:54,291
of the legendary shinobi!

331
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:05,625
Once we scale this,
we'll be at the top!

332
00:15:05,708 --> 00:15:07,458
I'm not gonna
let you beat me!

333
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,416
[ASUKA] Looks like if
I go through this tunnel,

334
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,333
it should be a shortcut.

335
00:15:15,416 --> 00:15:17,500
Man, it's really dark in here.

336
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,541
I hope nothing jumps out at me.

337
00:15:19,625 --> 00:15:22,208
No! You can't be
sacred of the dark, Asuka!

338
00:15:22,291 --> 00:15:23,708
Now be strong!

339
00:15:23,791 --> 00:15:25,958
You're the granddaughter of
the legendary shinobi Hanzo!

340
00:15:26,041 --> 00:15:27,458
[CAT] What a laugh!

341
00:15:27,541 --> 00:15:28,875
[ASUKA] Who's there?

342
00:15:28,958 --> 00:15:30,375
[CAT] Do you honestly
believe that being related to

343
00:15:30,458 --> 00:15:33,333
the legendary shinobi
means anything in combat?

344
00:15:33,416 --> 00:15:34,916
A Monster!

345
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,875
[meow]

346
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,708
[CAT] Blood lines
are nothing more than

347
00:15:40,791 --> 00:15:42,625
memories of family ties.

348
00:15:42,708 --> 00:15:46,500
It would be foolish of you to
rely on them to save your life!

349
00:15:49,083 --> 00:15:50,583
I never said that
they would save me!

350
00:15:50,666 --> 00:15:53,166
[CAT] Do your bloodlines
make you any less weak?

351
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,291
[gasp]

352
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:55,708
Ahhh!

353
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:58,208
[CAT] If you're not your
bloodline, then what are you?

354
00:15:58,291 --> 00:15:59,666
Just me.

355
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:01,125
Myself.

356
00:16:03,333 --> 00:16:05,291
I'm-- I'm Asuka!

357
00:16:05,375 --> 00:16:06,750
[ASUKA] Ahhh!

358
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,041
I lost.

359
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,000
[HOMURA] You're not fit to
call yourself the granddaughter

360
00:16:16,083 --> 00:16:18,208
of the legendary shinobi!

361
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,833
[ASUKA] She was right.

362
00:16:19,916 --> 00:16:21,541
Who do I think I am?

363
00:16:21,625 --> 00:16:24,375
[HANZO] You definitely
take after your father.

364
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:26,666
[YOUNG ASUKA] My dad?

365
00:16:26,750 --> 00:16:28,125
Do you really think so?

366
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:29,666
[HANZO] At first, I didn't
like the idea of your father

367
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,916
marrying your mother.

368
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:33,041
He gave up on his dream
of becoming a lawyer,

369
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,125
and told me he was going to
open a sushi shop instead.

370
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:39,125
He said, "I don't need
dreams, money, or land.

371
00:16:39,208 --> 00:16:41,875
All I want is to live
my life with the one I love.

372
00:16:41,958 --> 00:16:45,375
And there's nothing you can
say to convince me otherwise."

373
00:16:46,458 --> 00:16:48,333
[HANZO] I'll never forget
the look on his face.

374
00:16:48,416 --> 00:16:50,166
I could tell he meant business.

375
00:16:50,250 --> 00:16:52,500
That's all it took to
convince me he was making

376
00:16:52,583 --> 00:16:53,833
the right decision.

377
00:16:53,916 --> 00:16:55,333
Your father,
much like your mother,

378
00:16:55,416 --> 00:16:59,208
is a lot stronger than he
might seem at first glance.

379
00:16:59,291 --> 00:17:02,083
[ASUKA] Well, I'm a lot
stronger than I look, too!

380
00:17:03,375 --> 00:17:04,791
I'm here because of them.

381
00:17:04,875 --> 00:17:07,166
My mom, my dad,
and my grandfather.

382
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:10,125
I may not be them, but so what?

383
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,625
[ASUKA] I'm me!

384
00:17:11,708 --> 00:17:13,416
Secret Ninja Art.

385
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:16,041
Double Sword Attack!

386
00:17:17,291 --> 00:17:19,333
[meow]

387
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:21,291
[CAT] There's a feeling
of inferiority that comes

388
00:17:21,375 --> 00:17:23,458
from the pressure of
others' expectations.

389
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,708
It can cast shadows
of doubt within the mind,

390
00:17:25,791 --> 00:17:28,041
but you must remember,
shinobi have no reason

391
00:17:28,125 --> 00:17:29,708
to fear the shadows.

392
00:17:29,791 --> 00:17:31,041
Where'd it go?

393
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,250
[CAT] Shinobi are
courageous, because they have

394
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:36,416
nothing to fear except
for their own weaknesses.

395
00:17:39,958 --> 00:17:41,708
Once we get through the
jungle, it's just a little bit

396
00:17:41,791 --> 00:17:43,291
farther to the top
of the mountain!

397
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:44,625
Think so?

398
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:46,041
I can't say why, but it
feels like the right way!

399
00:17:46,125 --> 00:17:47,125
[YAGYU] Good enough.

400
00:17:47,208 --> 00:17:48,750
I've got faith in you.

401
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:55,250
[ALL] Huh?

402
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,208
Ha! Well, I win!
Sorry, losers!

403
00:17:57,291 --> 00:17:58,583
It's a tie!

404
00:17:58,666 --> 00:18:02,541
Didn't Sensei say there
would be a scroll somewhere?

405
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:03,666
[KATSURAGI]
Who the hell's that?

406
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:04,833
[WOMAN] Congratulations!

407
00:18:04,916 --> 00:18:06,250
You've reached the
summit of the mountain!

408
00:18:06,333 --> 00:18:08,166
However, your journey
is not over yet.

409
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,791
In fact, your quest
is only just beginning!

410
00:18:10,875 --> 00:18:12,083
[IKARUGA] What do
you want from us?

411
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:13,833
[WOMAN] Ladies.
I stand before you

412
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:15,708
as the final
gateway of Teimapaku

413
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,458
and the last obstacle
of your journey!

414
00:18:17,541 --> 00:18:18,791
So that's it!

415
00:18:18,875 --> 00:18:20,541
We're gonna have ta'
beat her to get the scroll.

416
00:18:20,625 --> 00:18:22,708
Well, if that's what
we have to do, then fine.

417
00:18:22,791 --> 00:18:24,083
Who are you?

418
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:25,208
You've heard my name.

419
00:18:25,291 --> 00:18:26,708
I'm Daidoji!

420
00:18:26,791 --> 00:18:28,166
What, like the Daidoji?

421
00:18:28,250 --> 00:18:30,166
Wait, so she's
actually a real person?

422
00:18:30,250 --> 00:18:32,000
I never thought
I'd get to meet her!

423
00:18:32,083 --> 00:18:33,250
Do you guys know her?

424
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:34,666
Yeah, only by name.

425
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:37,416
We've heard stories about the
ultimate upperclassman.

426
00:18:37,500 --> 00:18:40,083
She's a former student who,
despite passing her final exams,

427
00:18:40,166 --> 00:18:42,291
volunteered to stay behind
and help train shinobi!

428
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:44,750
Whoa! But why would
anybody want to do that!

429
00:18:44,833 --> 00:18:46,500
Daidoji's a living legend.

430
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:49,708
She's been at Hanzo for years
so she's gotta be pretty tough.

431
00:18:49,791 --> 00:18:52,750
On second thought.
Are we sure she's a woman?

432
00:18:52,833 --> 00:18:55,208
I see a couple of
reasons to think so!

433
00:18:57,250 --> 00:19:00,083
You don't stand a chance
against me one-on-one!

434
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:02,875
[DAIDOJI] You'll have
to attack me all at once!

435
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:07,708
[DAIDOJI] Ah!

436
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:16,625
[DAIDOJI] You
ladies are pathetic.

437
00:19:16,708 --> 00:19:18,000
She's way too strong!

438
00:19:18,083 --> 00:19:19,750
She's on another level.

439
00:19:19,833 --> 00:19:21,250
Yeah right, whatever.

440
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,791
I'm not scared of her!

441
00:19:30,666 --> 00:19:31,916
This is a travesty!

442
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,291
How dare you call
yourselves shinobi?

443
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,000
Unbelievable!
She's so powerful

444
00:19:36,083 --> 00:19:37,750
they couldn't even get close!

445
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,166
She's stronger than I am.

446
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,083
But I still have to try.

447
00:19:41,166 --> 00:19:42,541
Come on!

448
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:51,041
[ASUKA] If I run,
I only defeat myself!

449
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:55,916
[ASUKA] Ahhh!

450
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:56,750
Oh, no!

451
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:58,208
Asuka!

452
00:19:58,875 --> 00:20:01,250
[HIBARI] Are
you all right? Asuka!

453
00:20:01,333 --> 00:20:03,083
Please wake up!

454
00:20:03,166 --> 00:20:04,791
[DAIDOJI] You five bring
disgrace to the name

455
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,291
of Hanzo Academy.

456
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:10,708
[KIRIYA] Thank you, Daidoji.

457
00:20:10,791 --> 00:20:12,166
You've made your point.

458
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,166
Where did you come from?

459
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,041
What the hell is
going on here, Sensei?

460
00:20:16,125 --> 00:20:18,041
[KIRIYA] Daidoji is the
one who planned this trip.

461
00:20:18,125 --> 00:20:20,083
She was the brains
behind all of it.

462
00:20:20,875 --> 00:20:22,541
She wanted to do
her part to make sure

463
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,583
her underclassmen live up
to the Hanzo Academy name.

464
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:29,791
Now that's what I
call dedication. Amazing.

465
00:20:33,041 --> 00:20:35,000
Even though
your attacks lack focus,

466
00:20:35,083 --> 00:20:37,291
at least you were brave
enough to fight back.

467
00:20:37,375 --> 00:20:40,750
And in my book, that
counts for a great deal.

468
00:20:43,791 --> 00:20:46,000
I guess that means Asuka's
the winner this time.

469
00:20:46,083 --> 00:20:48,250
Well, whadaya gonna do?

470
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:52,583
[DAIDOJI] I can tell there's
a considerable amount of

471
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:54,791
untapped strength
deep within Asuka.

472
00:20:54,875 --> 00:20:58,458
It's clear that she is yet
to realize her full potential.

473
00:20:58,541 --> 00:21:00,500
So you can sense that, too?

474
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,291
Power like hers
that lies dormant

475
00:21:02,375 --> 00:21:03,750
is an unconscious power.

476
00:21:03,833 --> 00:21:06,041
As such, it is a
double-edged sword.

477
00:21:06,125 --> 00:21:09,000
Should she take the wrong path,
it's possible she could end up

478
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:11,250
in the same place as the other.

479
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:13,000
That won't happen.

480
00:21:13,083 --> 00:21:14,625
[KIRIYA] Not this time.

481
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:16,541
[RIN] You watch, Sensei!

482
00:21:16,625 --> 00:21:19,041
I'm gonna be a super-ninja!

483
00:21:21,083 --> 00:21:22,666
C'mon, we wanna
know what it says!

484
00:21:22,750 --> 00:21:24,416
So hurry up and open it!

485
00:21:25,375 --> 00:21:27,708
Jeez, Katsu. There's
no need to be pushy.

486
00:21:27,791 --> 00:21:29,458
You wanna read
it as much as I do.

487
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:31,541
Maybe. Yeah.

488
00:21:34,208 --> 00:21:35,791
[KATSURAGI] Well,
what does it say?

489
00:21:35,875 --> 00:21:39,291
"Power is a katana
and a shield." Wow.

490
00:21:39,375 --> 00:21:41,791
[DAIDOJI] This is the greatest
secret of the shinobi,

491
00:21:41,875 --> 00:21:44,250
written down by
Master Hanzo himself.

492
00:21:44,333 --> 00:21:45,791
[gasp]

493
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:48,208
[HANZO] In order
to gain true power,

494
00:21:48,291 --> 00:21:52,000
you must use both
the katana and the shield.

495
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,666
[ASUKA] I'm not gonna
whine or complain anymore.

496
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,083
Grandpa. I swear.

497
00:21:59,166 --> 00:22:01,291
I'll make you proud.

498
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:12,458
♪

499
00:23:32,416 --> 00:23:34,291
[ASUKA] Is it true
Ikaruga and Katsu used to

500
00:23:34,375 --> 00:23:35,541
have problems getting along?

501
00:23:35,625 --> 00:23:37,000
[KIRIYA] Yes, they were
quite cantankerrific.

502
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,125
[ASUKA] And when I came around?

503
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:39,458
[KIRIYA] You were
very freshmanormous.

504
00:23:39,541 --> 00:23:40,625
[ASUKA] And Yagyu and Hibari?

505
00:23:40,708 --> 00:23:41,708
[KIRIYA] They were
chumminacious.

506
00:23:41,791 --> 00:23:43,208
[ASUKA] Wait, what?

507
00:23:43,291 --> 00:23:44,583
[KIRIYA] Next time, "A Shinobi
Classroom Retrospective".

508
00:23:44,666 --> 00:23:46,875
[ASUKA] Come and get it like
your life depends on it!
