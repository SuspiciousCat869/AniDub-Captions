159
00:09:09,458 --> 00:09:11,583
and show 'em that Hanzo
shinobi mean business!

160
00:09:11,666 --> 00:09:13,125
But Katsu!

161
00:09:13,208 --> 00:09:14,000
Go!

162
00:09:14,083 --> 00:09:15,041
No, I can't!

163
00:09:15,125 --> 00:09:17,208
What are you
waiting for? Hurry!

164
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,750
Alright.

165
00:09:23,541 --> 00:09:25,208
[EVIL NINJAS] Ahhh!

166
00:09:25,291 --> 00:09:27,583
[Katsuragi yell]

167
00:09:28,291 --> 00:09:31,208
[evil ninjas scream]

168
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,375
[MIRAI] Aw shucks.

169
00:09:35,458 --> 00:09:37,416
It appears that one
of them has escaped.

170
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,666
[HIKAGE] Unfortunately, the
trap didn't trigger in time

171
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:41,625
to catch the shinobi Asuka.

172
00:09:41,708 --> 00:09:44,000
She's a lot faster
than I thought she'd be.

173
00:09:44,083 --> 00:09:45,250
Geez.

174
00:09:45,333 --> 00:09:47,000
You say that as if
you're impressed with her.

175
00:09:47,083 --> 00:09:49,833
[KATSURAGI] Ha! I knew
you'd be lurkin' around here!

176
00:09:49,916 --> 00:09:51,791
[MIRAI] Well, this
works out perfectly.

177
00:09:51,875 --> 00:09:54,833
I was hoping to take
my revenge on you!

178
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:58,250
I guess that means
I get to go another round

179
00:09:58,333 --> 00:09:59,541
against you, blondie.

180
00:09:59,625 --> 00:10:01,666
Good, I've been
looking forward to it!

181
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,208
You disgust me!

182
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,458
[MIRAI] I've hated you from
the moment I laid eyes on you!

183
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:07,541
Where is Hibari being hidden?

184
00:10:08,416 --> 00:10:10,333
Don't you dare
ignore me, pigtails!

185
00:10:10,416 --> 00:10:11,708
Ready, Katsu?

186
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,166
Let's do it.

187
00:10:16,250 --> 00:10:18,666
[power yell]

188
00:10:19,708 --> 00:10:21,541
Shinobi kekkai!

189
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,500
Shinobi kekkai!

190
00:10:29,375 --> 00:10:32,250
Hate that I had to
copy Ikaruga, but oh well.

191
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,083
[HIKAGE] Is this necessary?

192
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:37,500
I mean, you're only gonna lose.

193
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:43,666
Well, you won't be
able to ignore me anymore

194
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:45,541
now that we're in a kekkai.

195
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:47,666
I came here to protect
my friend Hibari.

196
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,125
Not listen to you.

197
00:10:49,208 --> 00:10:51,958
[HIKAGE] Why is it that you
want to fight me so badly?

198
00:10:52,041 --> 00:10:53,583
Because ever since
you kicked my butt,

199
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:55,750
all I could think about
was returnin' the favor!

200
00:10:55,833 --> 00:10:58,333
Now that I've got the chance,
I'm not gonna blow it!

201
00:10:58,416 --> 00:11:00,625
Let me to give you a
word of advice, blondie.

202
00:11:00,708 --> 00:11:01,916
Advice?

203
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,583
[HIKAGE] You should never
talk while fighting,

204
00:11:03,666 --> 00:11:05,541
'cause you'll bite your tongue.

205
00:11:05,625 --> 00:11:07,583
Fine, then I'll
get right to it!

206
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,916
[HIKAGE] That look in her eyes.

207
00:11:23,791 --> 00:11:26,500
[MAN] Fear. Pity. Anger.

208
00:11:26,583 --> 00:11:29,125
In our line of work,
emotion can prove fatal,

209
00:11:29,208 --> 00:11:30,833
so you must learn
to suppress it.

210
00:11:30,916 --> 00:11:33,458
Go after your target with a
cool head and you'll increase

211
00:11:33,541 --> 00:11:36,250
your chances of survival.

212
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,208
[HIKAGE] When I look in
her eyes, it's like she's

213
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:40,416
reaching within me to bring
those suppressed emotions

214
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,750
to the surface.

215
00:11:41,833 --> 00:11:43,250
[KATSURAGI] Ha!
[HIKAGE] Ugh.

216
00:11:45,541 --> 00:11:47,416
Why're you just
standin' there? Bring it!

217
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:50,458
It feels... like a
wave of sadness hit me.

218
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:52,000
How bizarre.

219
00:11:52,083 --> 00:11:54,458
It's hard to believe
I ever had these feelings.

220
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:55,833
What're you babblin'
to yourself about?

221
00:11:55,916 --> 00:11:57,000
Get over here and fight!

222
00:11:57,083 --> 00:11:58,833
[HIKAGE] You don't
have to tell me twice.

223
00:11:58,916 --> 00:12:02,583
Ready to die?
Secret ninja art! Thrust!

224
00:12:02,666 --> 00:12:04,416
Let's see what you've got!

225
00:12:11,791 --> 00:12:14,541
[Katsuragi breathing heavy]

226
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:18,666
I'm not gonna lose to you.

227
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:20,125
Oh really?

228
00:12:20,208 --> 00:12:22,708
Well, one of us has to lose
and it ain't gonna be me!

229
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,833
[grunts]

230
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:43,166
You're not the only person here

231
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:46,000
who's trying to protect
something they cherish!

232
00:12:47,291 --> 00:12:49,625
I am, too, y'know.

233
00:12:52,875 --> 00:12:58,875
[Young Mirai crying]

234
00:13:07,958 --> 00:13:09,541
Here, watch me do it.

235
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,666
[gasp]

236
00:13:14,250 --> 00:13:16,541
[HOMURA] Okay,
now you give it a try.

237
00:13:18,666 --> 00:13:20,875
[MIRAI] I also have something...

238
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:23,666
...that's worth fighting for!

239
00:13:25,333 --> 00:13:27,083
I know that.

240
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,791
What? How? You don't
know anything about me!

241
00:13:30,875 --> 00:13:33,625
[Yagyu power yell]

242
00:13:33,708 --> 00:13:35,416
[MIRAI] Ahhh!

243
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:41,375
You're right, I may not know
what it is you hold dear,

244
00:13:41,458 --> 00:13:43,208
but I do know this...

245
00:13:43,291 --> 00:13:44,833
All of us have something,

246
00:13:44,916 --> 00:13:46,791
that we would give
our lives to protect.

247
00:13:46,875 --> 00:13:49,375
[MIRAI] My friends,
'cause they don't ignore me.

248
00:13:49,458 --> 00:13:51,041
Understandable,
there's nothing worse

249
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:52,750
than being ignored.

250
00:13:52,833 --> 00:13:54,125
I feel the same way!

251
00:13:54,208 --> 00:13:56,458
I really hate myself
for agreeing with you!

252
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:00,333
Secret ninja art!
Valkyrie, fire!

253
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,333
[YAGYU] Ahhh!

254
00:14:06,416 --> 00:14:08,500
[gunfire]

255
00:14:16,250 --> 00:14:19,750
[both power yell]

256
00:14:22,833 --> 00:14:24,458
You're not too bad.

257
00:14:24,541 --> 00:14:26,583
Well, neither are you.

258
00:14:28,708 --> 00:14:31,250
Okay, one more
floor and I'm golden!

259
00:14:33,708 --> 00:14:35,666
It's just you?

260
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:36,875
Whaddya mean?

261
00:14:36,958 --> 00:14:38,333
[HOMURA] I never
would've expected you to be

262
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,125
the last good
girl left standing.

263
00:14:40,208 --> 00:14:41,666
[ASUKA] What have
you done with Hibari?

264
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:43,583
[HOMURA] Unfortunately,
she got caught eavesdropping,

265
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,750
so we've got her
locked up in a cell.

266
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,375
What the heck
was she thinking?

267
00:14:47,458 --> 00:14:49,458
I bet that she was trying
to get the scroll back!

268
00:14:49,541 --> 00:14:50,958
[HOMURA] If you
wanna go any farther,

269
00:14:51,041 --> 00:14:53,041
you're gonna
have to get past me.

270
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,791
Good luck, Asuka!

271
00:14:57,166 --> 00:14:58,958
Shinobi kekkai!

272
00:15:03,208 --> 00:15:05,500
Homura! I'm
gonna take you down!

273
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:07,666
Ha! Yeah right, you wish.

274
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:16,750
Uh-oh, what a shame!

275
00:15:16,833 --> 00:15:18,791
I turned my back
and I lost a prisoner.

276
00:15:18,875 --> 00:15:20,125
[HARUKA] How careless of me.

277
00:15:20,208 --> 00:15:22,291
I'm begging you, Haruka.
Please let me outta here!

278
00:15:22,375 --> 00:15:23,541
And why should I do that?

279
00:15:23,625 --> 00:15:24,666
[HIBARI] I need to
tell my friends about

280
00:15:24,750 --> 00:15:26,250
the yoke technique!

281
00:15:26,333 --> 00:15:29,250
I've gotta warn them 'cause you
guys'll die if they beat you!

282
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,583
What's it matter?

283
00:15:30,666 --> 00:15:32,083
Huh?

284
00:15:32,166 --> 00:15:33,750
[HARUKA] The only way you and
your friends will be able

285
00:15:33,833 --> 00:15:36,208
to complete your mission is if
you can defeat us in battle.

286
00:15:36,291 --> 00:15:37,791
I don't wanna complete
the mission if it means

287
00:15:37,875 --> 00:15:39,375
you guys're gonna die!

288
00:15:40,125 --> 00:15:42,291
[HARUKA] Well, if our
time's up, then so be it.

289
00:15:42,375 --> 00:15:43,625
Like it or not,
we've been ordered

290
00:15:43,708 --> 00:15:45,166
to go out there
and risk it all.

291
00:15:45,250 --> 00:15:46,750
We've no choice but to fight.

292
00:15:46,833 --> 00:15:49,416
It's our penance for being
saved from our living hell.

293
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,333
[HIBARI] You never told me
how you ended up here.

294
00:15:51,416 --> 00:15:53,208
Why did you
become an evil ninja?

295
00:15:53,291 --> 00:15:54,833
[HARUKA] My father is
the general director

296
00:15:54,916 --> 00:15:56,041
of a large hospital.

297
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:57,333
[HIBARI] He is?

298
00:15:57,416 --> 00:15:59,583
[HARUKA] His public
reputation was impeccable,

299
00:15:59,666 --> 00:16:02,333
but in reality, he was
a despicably evil man.

300
00:16:02,416 --> 00:16:04,708
He silenced malpractice
cases with cash he made

301
00:16:04,791 --> 00:16:06,875
by cheating on his taxes.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,708
[HARUKA] He rarely spent
any time at home with me

303
00:16:09,791 --> 00:16:12,916
and my mother, but not
because he was working.

304
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,916
I'm sure you can guess why.

305
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,333
Instead of taking her
frustrations out on him,

306
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,041
my mother doted on me.

307
00:16:20,125 --> 00:16:21,583
No, I take that back.

308
00:16:21,666 --> 00:16:23,583
It wasn't so much
that she doted on me,

309
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:27,916
as I was her dress-up doll.
A toy for her to play with.

310
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,666
[HARUKA'S MOTHER] How adorable!
You look precious!

311
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,375
Then when I
started middle school,

312
00:16:34,458 --> 00:16:37,291
I found it harder to deal
with my mother's smothering.

313
00:16:37,375 --> 00:16:40,541
But instead of speaking up,
I buried my feelings.

314
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,666
[HARUKA] You can only hide
your emotions for so long

315
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:45,958
before your sanity
starts breaking down.

316
00:16:46,625 --> 00:16:47,833
[YOUNG HARUKA] If I
just burn everything,

317
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,458
then that'll be the end of it.

318
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:53,291
Finally, I can be free
once and for all.

319
00:16:55,666 --> 00:16:57,125
[gasp]

320
00:16:57,208 --> 00:16:59,750
[SUZUNE] Didn't anyone ever
teach you not to play with fire?

321
00:17:08,333 --> 00:17:10,833
I had no idea that
Suzune-sensei had been

322
00:17:10,916 --> 00:17:12,916
scouting me for Hebijo Academy.

323
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,083
[HARUKA] She certainly
has a keen eye.

324
00:17:16,583 --> 00:17:19,166
[HARUKA] While the mere thought
of death might terrify you,

325
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:21,375
we aren't afraid because we've
been pulled from the brink

326
00:17:21,458 --> 00:17:23,916
of death once already.

327
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,500
I'm free?

328
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,583
[HARUKA] Well, not to roam
the castle but you're free

329
00:17:27,666 --> 00:17:29,166
to fight me if you wish.

330
00:17:29,250 --> 00:17:32,166
Let's see if you've got what it
takes to defeat me in battle.

331
00:17:32,791 --> 00:17:34,791
[HARUKA] What's
the matter? C'mon!

332
00:17:34,875 --> 00:17:36,916
Don't you wanna
take a shot at me?

333
00:17:38,583 --> 00:17:41,000
[HIBARI] Shinobi
transformation!

334
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:44,625
[HIBARI] I'm gonna do this
all by myself, Yagyu!

335
00:17:44,708 --> 00:17:45,791
You just watch!

336
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,000
You don't have to
worry about me anymore.

337
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,916
[HIBARI] Shinobi kekkai!

338
00:17:52,625 --> 00:17:54,083
[HARUKA] My,
isn't this charming?

339
00:17:54,166 --> 00:17:55,833
[HIBARI] I've got a question
about the yoke technique,

340
00:17:55,916 --> 00:17:57,916
do you know if you have some
time before it takes effect

341
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,458
or does it happen right away?

342
00:17:59,541 --> 00:18:02,416
Hmmm. I'm afraid I don't have
an answer for you, my dear.

343
00:18:02,500 --> 00:18:03,458
[HIBARI] Huh?

344
00:18:03,541 --> 00:18:04,791
It activates
when the person who cast

345
00:18:04,875 --> 00:18:06,708
the technique
acknowledges our loss.

346
00:18:06,791 --> 00:18:08,958
You see, there's a
surprisingly fine line

347
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,583
between winning and losing.

348
00:18:10,666 --> 00:18:12,666
So, all we have to do
is keep the headmaster

349
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:13,833
from activating it!

350
00:18:13,916 --> 00:18:14,875
Now don't you
think you might be

351
00:18:14,958 --> 00:18:16,875
getting ahead
of yourself, cutie?

352
00:18:18,583 --> 00:18:19,833
[HARUKA] You don't
honestly believe that you

353
00:18:19,916 --> 00:18:22,250
and your friends can
defeat us, do you?

354
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,125
[HARUKA] Why don't you
just give up, Hibari?

355
00:18:30,291 --> 00:18:33,333
I may be down but
this fight isn't over.

356
00:18:33,416 --> 00:18:36,958
[HIBARI] I'm not the
weakling, that you think I am.

357
00:18:37,041 --> 00:18:38,875
I'm gonna win.

358
00:18:38,958 --> 00:18:40,750
You just watch me!

359
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:45,166
Secret ninja art.
Come to me.

360
00:18:45,250 --> 00:18:47,291
[rumbling]

361
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:50,000
[bunny yell]

362
00:18:50,958 --> 00:18:53,541
[HARUKA] I won't fall
for the same trick twice!

363
00:19:03,708 --> 00:19:07,125
My, that was careless of me.

364
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,541
Hey guys.

365
00:19:10,625 --> 00:19:12,666
I hope you can hear me!

366
00:19:15,041 --> 00:19:16,041
Hibari!

367
00:19:16,125 --> 00:19:17,291
[HIBARI] Don't
fight the evil ninja!

368
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:18,625
What do you mean? Why not?

369
00:19:18,708 --> 00:19:20,500
If they lose in battle,
the headmaster'll activate

370
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:22,416
the yoke technique
and they'll die!

371
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,708
[KATSURAGI] Seriously?

372
00:19:23,791 --> 00:19:25,625
If they lose, they die?

373
00:19:25,708 --> 00:19:27,708
I promise I'll explain
it all to you later!

374
00:19:27,791 --> 00:19:30,791
But for now, just try
not to fight them!

375
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:31,833
Oh no!

376
00:19:31,916 --> 00:19:33,125
I had no idea
Hibari was capable

377
00:19:33,208 --> 00:19:35,375
of such powerful telepathy.

378
00:19:35,458 --> 00:19:36,791
[ASUKA] Is that true?

379
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,833
If you lose this fight,
you'll lose your life?

380
00:19:39,916 --> 00:19:41,041
Yep, that's
what happens when

381
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,416
the yoke
technique's invoked.

382
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,833
How can you act like
it's no big deal that

383
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:47,250
you're risking your life?

384
00:19:47,333 --> 00:19:49,666
[HOMURA] 'Cause it's not
a big deal. If I fail, I die.

385
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:51,750
Whatever. Personally,
I think that's the way

386
00:19:51,833 --> 00:19:53,541
it oughta be for all shinobi.

387
00:19:53,625 --> 00:19:58,041
Homura. How
could you say that?

388
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,916
You've got it all wrong!

389
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,708
But why did you
let him do this to you?

390
00:20:08,791 --> 00:20:10,291
Now, now, there's
no need to worry.

391
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,500
Nothing will happen to us unless
we lose and that's not likely.

392
00:20:13,583 --> 00:20:14,666
[KATSURAGI] That's messed up.

393
00:20:14,750 --> 00:20:15,916
That's how it goes.

394
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,500
[KATSURAGI] How can
you be so nonchalant?

395
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,833
Don't you care if you die?

396
00:20:21,250 --> 00:20:22,541
Drama queen.

397
00:20:22,625 --> 00:20:25,333
She just had to go and
tell everybody, didn't she?

398
00:20:25,416 --> 00:20:26,416
Hibari!

399
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:28,583
I'm so glad to hear
that she's safe!

400
00:20:28,666 --> 00:20:30,541
[MIRAI] Hey! I'm
still here ya' know!

401
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:32,750
I told you how much
I hate being ignored!

402
00:20:33,458 --> 00:20:35,041
Ugh. What?

403
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,625
I'm not going to fight you.

404
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:39,625
Not when your survival
depends on the outcome.

405
00:20:42,041 --> 00:20:44,375
We've gotta find the
headmaster on the top level!

406
00:20:44,458 --> 00:20:47,333
He's the only one that
can lift the yoke technique.

407
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,750
[HIBARI] And I'll grab the
scroll while I'm up there!

408
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:56,333
Not if I stop you!
Secret ninja art Death Kiss!

409
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,833
[HIBARI] Ahhh!

410
00:21:03,958 --> 00:21:05,291
[HARUKA] Finally.

411
00:21:05,375 --> 00:21:08,708
It's time for you to become
my little puppet, cutie.

412
00:21:11,125 --> 00:21:12,208
[ALL] Secret ninja art!

413
00:21:12,291 --> 00:21:14,666
[IKARUGA] Phoenix
Flame Flash, One!

414
00:21:14,750 --> 00:21:16,125
Ahhh!

415
00:21:17,083 --> 00:21:18,750
[screaming]

416
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,333
[KATSURAGI] Tornado Spindel!

417
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,791
[KATSURAGI] Ha!

418
00:21:29,875 --> 00:21:31,500
[dinging]

419
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:36,125
[MIRAI] Ahhh!

420
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:39,666
We've gotta find this
headmaster douche bag!

421
00:21:42,083 --> 00:21:44,708
Hey! Tell me how we
can get to the top level!

422
00:21:44,791 --> 00:21:45,791
Why should I?

423
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,875
What good is goin'
up there gonna do?

424
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:50,291
As shinobi we have to
be ready to take the lives

425
00:21:50,375 --> 00:21:51,958
of others to complete
our mission.

426
00:21:52,041 --> 00:21:55,125
It sucks, but at least we have
control over our own lives!

427
00:21:55,208 --> 00:21:56,666
[KATSURAGI] Why
would you give that up?

428
00:21:56,750 --> 00:21:59,875
You're outta luck. The
only path is sealed off.

429
00:22:03,708 --> 00:22:05,125
Someone's helpin' them.

430
00:22:05,208 --> 00:22:06,791
Let's head to the top, Yagyu!

431
00:22:06,875 --> 00:22:08,458
You go on without me.

432
00:22:08,541 --> 00:22:09,791
[KATSURAGI] What?

433
00:22:09,875 --> 00:22:11,541
I think Hibari's voice
was coming from below us.

434
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:13,375
So I'm gonna look for her.

435
00:22:13,458 --> 00:22:16,791
Okay. Then go
do what you gotta do!

436
00:22:16,875 --> 00:22:20,208
But you weren't this strong
the last time we fought.

437
00:22:20,291 --> 00:22:22,375
[IKARUGA] Ninjutsu is a skill
of the mind and right now

438
00:22:22,458 --> 00:22:24,375
mine is exceedingly frustrated.

439
00:22:24,458 --> 00:22:26,208
We should be joining
forces to take down the jerk

440
00:22:26,291 --> 00:22:29,166
who's controlling you, and not
fighting against each other.

441
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,791
You think?

442
00:22:30,875 --> 00:22:32,875
I don't know
how to explain it,

443
00:22:32,958 --> 00:22:35,416
but this added power is
a reflection of my pride

444
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,458
as a good ninja.

445
00:22:37,541 --> 00:22:38,708
[YOMI] Well, good for you.

446
00:22:38,791 --> 00:22:41,166
It must be nice to be
so incredibly fortunate.

447
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:42,375
There's something
you should know about

448
00:22:42,458 --> 00:22:44,250
what you saw on TV that day.

449
00:22:44,333 --> 00:22:46,916
You see, the only reason my
father did that interview

450
00:22:47,000 --> 00:22:49,333
was to announce
he was adopting a child.

451
00:22:50,250 --> 00:22:52,541
Hold on, you mean,
you were adopted?

452
00:22:52,625 --> 00:22:54,333
He claimed to be a
philanthropist who opened

453
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,333
his heart to a girl who had
lost all her relatives,

454
00:22:57,416 --> 00:23:00,291
but the truth is he was forced
to adopt me to carry on

455
00:23:00,375 --> 00:23:04,083
the shinobi family line because
his own son was a failure.

456
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,041
[Yomi gasp]

457
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:09,458
All I have to my name is my
mission to live as a shinobi.

458
00:23:09,541 --> 00:23:10,791
And there's not
a drop's worth of

459
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:12,625
familial affection to be found.

460
00:23:12,708 --> 00:23:14,083
Uh.

461
00:23:16,166 --> 00:23:20,375
[YOMI] Why? Why did you
choose to tell me all of this?

462
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:24,083
[crying] It's not fair.

463
00:23:24,166 --> 00:23:27,333
How am I supposed
to hate you now?!

464
00:23:32,666 --> 00:23:34,583
[ASUKA] I know that whenever
we fall on hard times,

465
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:37,333
we can move past it, as
long as we work together

466
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:38,833
and look out for one another.

467
00:23:38,916 --> 00:23:41,416
Next time, the final
episode of Senran Kagura

468
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,166
Ninja Flash,
"Super-Secret Ninja Art".

469
00:23:44,250 --> 00:23:46,916
Come and get it like
your life depends on it!
