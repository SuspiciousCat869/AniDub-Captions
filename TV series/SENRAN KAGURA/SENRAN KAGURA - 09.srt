who's worried about Hibari.

160
00:09:31,833 --> 00:09:34,791
We want to do everything
we can to save her.

161
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:47,625
[birds chirping]

162
00:09:48,458 --> 00:09:50,875
It's gotta be
around here somewhere.

163
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,208
[HIBARI] That must be it.

164
00:09:57,291 --> 00:09:59,791
Hebijo Clandestine
Girl's Academy.

165
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:07,916
[EVIL NINJA 1] Who are you?

166
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,083
Um. I'm a student.
Please don't hurt me!

167
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:11,458
[EVIL NINJA 2] I've
never seen you before!

168
00:10:11,541 --> 00:10:13,125
How do we know
you're not a spy?

169
00:10:13,208 --> 00:10:14,875
I'm telling you
you've got it all wrong!

170
00:10:14,958 --> 00:10:16,666
I was invited
here by Miss Haruka!

171
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:17,750
[EVIL NINJA 1] What?

172
00:10:17,833 --> 00:10:19,208
[EVIL NINJA 2]
We'll see about that.

173
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:26,458
[EVIL NINJA] Miss Haruka.

174
00:10:26,541 --> 00:10:27,791
Yes, go ahead.

175
00:10:27,875 --> 00:10:28,958
[EVIL NINJA] We caught
a suspicious-looking girl

176
00:10:29,041 --> 00:10:30,708
outside the academy.

177
00:10:30,791 --> 00:10:32,083
[HARUKA] A girl?

178
00:10:32,166 --> 00:10:34,250
[EVIL NINJA] She says
she was invited here by you.

179
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:37,833
[HARUKA] My, my. That
was sooner than I expected.

180
00:10:37,916 --> 00:10:40,041
Have her brought to
my room immediately.

181
00:10:40,125 --> 00:10:41,500
[EVIL NINJA] But the
rules say that when we

182
00:10:41,583 --> 00:10:44,625
catch an intruder we must
report it to Suzune-sensei.

183
00:10:45,916 --> 00:10:48,333
And I said you should bring
her to my room immediately.

184
00:10:48,416 --> 00:10:50,833
[EVIL NINJA] Uh yes,
of course! Right away, ma'am!

185
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:06,208
Hello, cutie.

186
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:07,666
[HARUKA] Well, they
certainly weren't creative

187
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,375
with their knots, were they?

188
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,375
That's not very sexy at all.

189
00:11:11,458 --> 00:11:14,166
My apologies. The girls
here may be a bit rough

190
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:16,291
compared to
what you're used to.

191
00:11:17,041 --> 00:11:18,458
But I'm not like them.

192
00:11:18,541 --> 00:11:21,250
I always take
special care of my pets.

193
00:11:23,375 --> 00:11:24,875
[HIBARI] Is this alright?

194
00:11:24,958 --> 00:11:26,083
[HARUKA] Of course it is.

195
00:11:26,166 --> 00:11:28,666
I was just about to
bathe when you arrived.

196
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh. I see.

197
00:11:30,083 --> 00:11:32,083
[HARUKA] I'm so thrilled
that you've come here.

198
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:34,458
In time you'll learn to
think of it as your home,

199
00:11:34,541 --> 00:11:36,166
and me as family.

200
00:11:38,125 --> 00:11:40,166
Yeah. I can't thank you enough

201
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:42,916
for taking me in, Haruka.

202
00:11:43,541 --> 00:11:44,541
[HIBARI] But
I'm a little worried

203
00:11:44,625 --> 00:11:46,583
about how the
others will treat me.

204
00:11:46,666 --> 00:11:49,208
Will they really accept
someone who was their enemy?

205
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,750
[HARUKA] Of course they will.

206
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:53,125
Don't you worry your
pretty little head.

207
00:11:53,208 --> 00:11:55,583
Just relax and enjoy yourself.

208
00:11:55,666 --> 00:11:58,666
Let me relieve
that troubled mind.

209
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,791
[HARUKA] I couldn't care
less about the headmaster

210
00:12:01,875 --> 00:12:04,333
and his "secret
scroll" nonsense.

211
00:12:04,416 --> 00:12:06,791
I already have
exactly what I wanted.

212
00:12:06,875 --> 00:12:08,250
[HIBARI] I know I can do this.

213
00:12:08,333 --> 00:12:11,416
I'm going to set
everything right, I swear it.

214
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,666
Welcome to the
elite training grounds.

215
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,250
Not much to look at, I know.

216
00:12:16,333 --> 00:12:18,708
But you'll soon see we
use every resource we have

217
00:12:18,791 --> 00:12:21,541
to make the workouts
as grueling as possible.

218
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:24,500
[HARUKA] Survival of
the fittest is law here.

219
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:27,000
[HOMURA] Well, well,
we have a visitor.

220
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:28,958
It appears that we've
lowered our standards,

221
00:12:29,041 --> 00:12:30,875
guess they'll let
anyone in these days.

222
00:12:30,958 --> 00:12:31,958
We're definitely gonna have to

223
00:12:32,041 --> 00:12:34,041
talk to the security personnel.

224
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:36,250
Girls. I'd like you
to meet the newest member

225
00:12:36,333 --> 00:12:39,666
of our academy. I
scouted her out myself.

226
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,583
[MIRAI] I swear, if
this is another one of your

227
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,875
"pet" projects,
I'm gonna throw up.

228
00:12:45,416 --> 00:12:47,291
Are you sure about this?

229
00:12:48,583 --> 00:12:50,333
Well, I don't have a
place at Hanzo anymore,

230
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,625
so I might as well
be somewhere I'm wanted.

231
00:12:52,708 --> 00:12:57,375
I see. Well from now on consider
all of us your friends, okay?

232
00:12:57,458 --> 00:12:58,750
[HOMURA] Something wrong?

233
00:12:58,833 --> 00:13:02,583
Well, no. Just-- I didn't
expect you to trust me.

234
00:13:02,666 --> 00:13:04,500
And why is
that? Shouldn't we?

235
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,291
Let me guess,
you think we're accepting

236
00:13:06,375 --> 00:13:08,000
a former enemy too quickly.

237
00:13:08,083 --> 00:13:10,083
What were you
expecting, a shake down?

238
00:13:10,166 --> 00:13:12,916
Ever notice that "good"
people are often narrow minded?

239
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,416
Evil is a much more
tolerant way of life.

240
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,791
You might find
that the line between

241
00:13:16,875 --> 00:13:19,166
good and evil is a blurry one.

242
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:21,750
Okay. But what
if I betrayed you?

243
00:13:21,833 --> 00:13:23,500
Would you forgive me?

244
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:26,125
[HIKAGE] Depends. There are
many subtle levels of betrayal,

245
00:13:26,208 --> 00:13:27,666
and as long as
you don't get caught

246
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:29,250
there's nothing
to forgive, right?

247
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:30,500
Uh.

248
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:31,958
If you think you
can get away with it,

249
00:13:32,041 --> 00:13:33,750
then go ahead and try.

250
00:13:33,833 --> 00:13:36,500
Evil never turns
its back on anyone.

251
00:13:38,416 --> 00:13:42,291
[HOMURA] Just remember. Whatever
you do is at your own risk.

252
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,250
[MIRAI] Yeah, yeah. Anyway...

253
00:13:44,333 --> 00:13:46,083
If you're stupid
enough to ignore me,

254
00:13:46,166 --> 00:13:47,291
I'll slit your throat.

255
00:13:47,375 --> 00:13:49,041
I won't ignore
you, just don't hurt me!

256
00:13:49,125 --> 00:13:51,000
Uh huh. I've
heard that before.

257
00:13:51,083 --> 00:13:53,208
So I'll be keeping
my eye on you, missy.

258
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:54,666
Uh. 'Kay.

259
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:04,583
So, I take it you're
a middle-class girl?

260
00:14:04,666 --> 00:14:07,083
At least you're not a snob
like that one friend of yours.

261
00:14:07,166 --> 00:14:08,500
May I ask you a question?

262
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:09,958
How do you feel about sprouts?

263
00:14:10,041 --> 00:14:11,041
Huh?

264
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:12,875
 Sprouts. I'm
talkin' about sprouts.

265
00:14:12,958 --> 00:14:15,958
[HIBARI] Oh, um. They're
pretty good, I guess.

266
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:18,250
[YOMI] Really? Don't you think
that the government's increase

267
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,750
in the price of sprouts
is absolutely ridiculous?

268
00:14:20,833 --> 00:14:23,416
I mean, how are the common
folk supposed to get by?

269
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:25,750
You understand me, don't you?

270
00:14:25,833 --> 00:14:27,041
[HIKAGE] I like her already.

271
00:14:27,125 --> 00:14:28,416
If she'll let
Yomi talk her ear off

272
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,375
she can be the head of
the team for all I care.

273
00:14:30,458 --> 00:14:31,708
[HOMURA] Very funny.

274
00:14:31,791 --> 00:14:34,333
It's almost time for
training to begin. Let's go.

275
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,208
[MALE TEACHER] The
word "shinobi" is written

276
00:14:37,291 --> 00:14:38,791
as "heart" under "blade."

277
00:14:38,875 --> 00:14:42,708
Temper your heart until it is as
cold as the steel of your sword.

278
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:43,708
Something wrong?

279
00:14:43,791 --> 00:14:45,416
Oh, no. I'm just
surprised you have

280
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:46,958
so many students here.

281
00:14:47,041 --> 00:14:50,541
I mean, Hanzo Academy only has
five students, including me.

282
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,625
That's because Hebijo
Academy isn't concerned about

283
00:14:53,708 --> 00:14:56,083
[HARUKA] bloodlines
the way other schools are.

284
00:14:56,166 --> 00:14:59,041
We gather here for a
variety of different reasons.

285
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:00,833
Some seek fortune,
while others simply

286
00:15:00,916 --> 00:15:02,958
want to hide from the world.

287
00:15:03,041 --> 00:15:05,500
[HARUKA] Homura came from
a family line of good ninjas.

288
00:15:05,583 --> 00:15:06,916
If things had
played out differently,

289
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,791
she may have been
a classmate at Hanzo.

290
00:15:08,875 --> 00:15:10,958
[HIBARI] Then, why did
she become an evil ninja?

291
00:15:11,041 --> 00:15:14,125
[HARUKA] A matter of
"ineligibility," you could say.

292
00:15:14,208 --> 00:15:17,041
As you may recall, one
of Hanzo's requirements

293
00:15:17,125 --> 00:15:18,833
for new students
is that they have

294
00:15:18,916 --> 00:15:21,791
no prior record
of criminal behavior.

295
00:15:21,875 --> 00:15:23,500
[HIBARI] Criminal behavior?

296
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:25,333
[HARUKA] I heard
she stabbed someone.

297
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,333
[Hibari gasp]

298
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:27,416
[HARUKA] She
had no other choice

299
00:15:27,500 --> 00:15:29,333
but to become an
evil ninja after that.

300
00:15:30,583 --> 00:15:33,291
[HARUKA] Mirai, on the other
hand, was a victim of violence.

301
00:15:33,375 --> 00:15:35,041
She joined Hebijo
Academy in order to

302
00:15:35,125 --> 00:15:37,375
get revenge on
those that bullied her.

303
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:39,833
[HARUKA] Hikage was
raised on the battlefield

304
00:15:39,916 --> 00:15:42,041
since she was a child,
which forced her to become

305
00:15:42,125 --> 00:15:44,625
a ruthless and
deadly fighting machine.

306
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:47,916
[HARUKA] Yomi grew
up in extreme poverty,

307
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,708
and lost her
parents as a result.

308
00:15:49,791 --> 00:15:51,791
She despises the
world's social structure,

309
00:15:51,875 --> 00:15:53,708
and hopes to destroy it.

310
00:15:57,625 --> 00:15:59,791
[HARUKA] Here at Hebijo
Clandestine Girls' Academy,

311
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:01,916
the five of us have been
recognized for rising to the

312
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,875
top of the class on the merits
of our own unique strengths.

313
00:16:04,958 --> 00:16:06,625
[HARUKA] That freedom of
growth is what's allowed us

314
00:16:06,708 --> 00:16:08,333
to become so powerful.

315
00:16:13,625 --> 00:16:15,250
[HARUKA] That freedom of
growth is what's allowed us

316
00:16:15,333 --> 00:16:17,750
to become so powerful.

317
00:16:17,833 --> 00:16:20,583
[HIBARI] I miss my friends.

318
00:16:20,666 --> 00:16:22,625
I miss Yagyu.

319
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,750
[HARUKA] Sorry to interrupt.

320
00:16:24,833 --> 00:16:26,625
Huh?

321
00:16:26,708 --> 00:16:28,250
This is Suzune-sensei.

322
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:30,250
She's advisor here
at Hebijo Academy.

323
00:16:30,333 --> 00:16:32,041
[HIBARI] Hi. I'm Hibari!

324
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:34,583
[SUZUNE] Let's get to the
point. I find it unlikely that

325
00:16:34,666 --> 00:16:36,750
you've switched
sides of your own accord.

326
00:16:38,125 --> 00:16:39,291
You shouldn't worry.

327
00:16:39,375 --> 00:16:41,583
It's not as though
this is without precedent.

328
00:16:41,666 --> 00:16:43,583
[HARUKA] Now that these new
opportunities are open to her,

329
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:46,166
who knows how powerful
she might become?

330
00:16:46,250 --> 00:16:47,916
Right dear?

331
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,583
[SUZUNE] Haruka.
I leave her to you.

332
00:16:50,666 --> 00:16:52,125
[HARUKA] Yes, ma'am.

333
00:16:52,208 --> 00:16:53,375
[SUZUNE] Hibari, was it?

334
00:16:53,458 --> 00:16:54,833
[HIBARI] Uh, yes ma'am!

335
00:16:54,916 --> 00:16:56,708
[SUZUNE] It takes
incredible resolve to turn

336
00:16:56,791 --> 00:16:58,250
from good to evil.

337
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:01,750
You have to forsake
yourself, body and soul.

338
00:17:01,833 --> 00:17:04,375
Body and soul, huh?

339
00:17:05,916 --> 00:17:07,750
[HARUKA] Suzune-sensei
was once a good ninja,

340
00:17:07,833 --> 00:17:09,541
just like you were.

341
00:17:09,625 --> 00:17:11,166
That's top-secret, by the way.

342
00:17:11,250 --> 00:17:13,041
I'm only telling you
because I want you to realize

343
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,125
you're not alone.

344
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:16,000
She could help
you if you'll let her.

345
00:17:16,083 --> 00:17:20,375
That woman... used
to be a good ninja, too?

346
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:26,125
Hold on. Could
she possibly be--?

347
00:17:28,375 --> 00:17:31,583
[MAN] A transfer?
Do you think that's wise?

348
00:17:31,666 --> 00:17:33,875
[SUZUNE] One of our top
students recommended her.

349
00:17:33,958 --> 00:17:36,583
She has significant
skills as a shinobi.

350
00:17:36,666 --> 00:17:38,291
However, she is
a former member of--

351
00:17:38,375 --> 00:17:40,125
[MAN] Administration
over new recruits is

352
00:17:40,208 --> 00:17:42,083
your department, not mine.

353
00:17:42,166 --> 00:17:43,750
[SUZUNE] Yes, of course.

354
00:17:43,833 --> 00:17:46,791
[MAN] Tell me, are you
upset that I ordered the

355
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:49,583
theft of the scroll without
discussing it with you?

356
00:17:49,666 --> 00:17:51,708
[SUZUNE] I don't
care either way, sir.

357
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:53,875
As I said before,
simply acquiring it

358
00:17:53,958 --> 00:17:55,375
will accomplish nothing.

359
00:17:55,458 --> 00:17:58,125
Without the chosen one,
it's just useless paper.

360
00:17:58,208 --> 00:18:00,000
[MAN] Tread lightly, Suzune.

361
00:18:00,083 --> 00:18:01,625
Who do you think
makes it possible

362
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,541
for you to even be here?

363
00:18:03,625 --> 00:18:05,166
I'm the one who
took you in after you

364
00:18:05,250 --> 00:18:07,583
failed your mission
for the good ninja.

365
00:18:07,666 --> 00:18:10,666
You would be a corpse right
now if I hadn't intervened.

366
00:18:10,750 --> 00:18:12,708
[SUZUNE] I would
never forget, sir.

367
00:18:16,875 --> 00:18:18,833
[SUZUNE] Don't try to pretend
that you saved my life

368
00:18:18,916 --> 00:18:21,166
out of the kindness
of your heart.

369
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:24,125
You've used me just
as much as I've used you.

370
00:18:24,208 --> 00:18:26,500
The time has come.
Soon everything under

371
00:18:26,583 --> 00:18:29,458
the moon and stars will
be stained with blood.

372
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:34,625
Apparently, Hebijo has
an abundance of students.

373
00:18:34,708 --> 00:18:36,833
[IKARUGA] When you take
their numbers into account,

374
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:39,250
it'd be absolutely impossible
for them to stay hidden

375
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:41,375
inside the city
like Hanzo Academy.

376
00:18:41,458 --> 00:18:42,750
Yeah, you got a point.

377
00:18:42,833 --> 00:18:45,916
Maybe they hide in the
forest, or a mountain base.

378
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,666
So which way should
we start looking?

379
00:18:47,750 --> 00:18:49,625
It's a shinobi facility,
so they probably

380
00:18:49,708 --> 00:18:51,666
took chi flow and
feng shui into account

381
00:18:51,750 --> 00:18:52,666
when they were
building the place.

382
00:18:52,750 --> 00:18:53,875
[KATSURAGI] Mhm.

383
00:18:53,958 --> 00:18:56,541
I can't keep up,
this is too complicated.

384
00:18:56,625 --> 00:18:58,541
You seem to
have calmed down.

385
00:18:58,625 --> 00:19:00,291
Please forgive my outburst.

386
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,625
[KIRIYA] I'm not the
one who deserves an apology.

387
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,375
I'm just glad Asuka
was able to find you.

388
00:19:05,458 --> 00:19:07,083
[YAGYU] She
really surprised me.

389
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,458
[YAGYU] When she
confronted me, I was so angry

390
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:10,916
I couldn't hold back.

391
00:19:12,083 --> 00:19:13,583
[YAGYU] Yet she
still managed to easily

392
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:15,625
dodge my full-powered thrust.

393
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:19,166
[YAGYU] Even the
Hebijo shinobi we fought

394
00:19:19,250 --> 00:19:21,000
weren't able to
dodge that attack.

395
00:19:21,083 --> 00:19:22,541
[KIRIYA] Asuka's
abilities do seem to be

396
00:19:22,625 --> 00:19:24,541
improving at
an accelerated rate.

397
00:19:24,625 --> 00:19:26,666
She's becoming quite powerful.

398
00:19:26,750 --> 00:19:29,208
[YAGYU] Yes sir, I
believe that's the case.

399
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,500
[DAIDOJI] I can tell
there's a considerable amount

400
00:19:34,583 --> 00:19:36,791
of untapped strength
deep within Asuka.

401
00:19:36,875 --> 00:19:39,750
It's clear that she's yet
to realize her full potential.

402
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:41,333
Power like
hers that lies dormant

403
00:19:41,416 --> 00:19:42,958
is an unconscious power.

404
00:19:43,041 --> 00:19:45,291
As such, it is a
double-edged sword.

405
00:19:45,375 --> 00:19:47,541
Should she
take the wrong path--

406
00:19:47,625 --> 00:19:50,291
[KIRIYA] She'll end up
in the same place as her.

407
00:19:50,375 --> 00:19:52,000
[distant bell jingle]

408
00:19:52,083 --> 00:19:52,916
[YAGYU] What's wrong?

409
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,583
Nothing.

410
00:19:54,666 --> 00:19:56,583
[KIRIYA] I have some
business to take care of.

411
00:19:56,666 --> 00:19:58,250
Wait here until I get back.

412
00:19:58,333 --> 00:19:59,916
Understood, sir.

413
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:05,291
Well, that was different.

414
00:20:05,375 --> 00:20:07,000
[ASUKA] What are
you talking about?

415
00:20:07,083 --> 00:20:09,000
He usually vanishes
with a puff of smoke.

416
00:20:09,083 --> 00:20:10,583
Where's his ninja flair?

417
00:20:14,625 --> 00:20:16,791
[KIRIYA] The sound came
from somewhere around here.

418
00:20:16,875 --> 00:20:18,000
[bell jingle]

419
00:20:18,083 --> 00:20:20,041
[KIRIYA] Huh? Who are you?

420
00:20:20,125 --> 00:20:24,500
[SUZUNE] Hebijo Girls' Academy.
Shinobi Instructor. Suzune.

421
00:20:24,583 --> 00:20:25,541
Suzune?

422
00:20:25,625 --> 00:20:27,166
[SUZUNE] And you
are Hanzo Academy's

423
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:30,125
head instructor. Kiriya.

424
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:33,000
[SUZUNE] I challenge you.

425
00:20:48,625 --> 00:20:52,000
Impressive. But I doubt you
came here just to show off.

426
00:20:58,375 --> 00:20:59,375
[KIRIYA] Rin!

427
00:20:59,458 --> 00:21:01,791
[chuckles] It's been awhile.

428
00:21:01,875 --> 00:21:04,333
I had to see if you
had gotten rusty or not.

429
00:21:04,416 --> 00:21:07,250
[SUZUNE] I would say the
answer is definitely "not".

430
00:21:08,041 --> 00:21:09,333
[SUZUNE] I'm surprised
you didn't realize

431
00:21:09,416 --> 00:21:10,583
it was me earlier.

432
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:11,875
I've had many great students,

433
00:21:11,958 --> 00:21:14,250
it's hard to remember
each one's techniques.

434
00:21:16,583 --> 00:21:19,416
[SUZUNE] I guess so. Speaking
of students, one of yours

435
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:21,250
just arrived
at Hebijo Academy.

436
00:21:21,333 --> 00:21:23,375
Does the name
"Hibari" ring a bell?

437
00:21:23,458 --> 00:21:25,458
Please tell me you haven't
done anything to her.

438
00:21:25,541 --> 00:21:26,916
[SUZUNE] She's fine.
But we both have

439
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,750
responsibilities now, don't we?

440
00:21:28,833 --> 00:21:30,500
I think you know
what you have to do.

441
00:21:30,583 --> 00:21:31,666
Why did you do it?

442
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:33,875
Why did you choose
to become an evil ninja?

443
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:35,916
The answer to that question...

444
00:21:37,208 --> 00:21:39,916
...is on the paper
you hold in your hand.

445
00:21:42,750 --> 00:21:44,458
A map leading to Hebijo?

446
00:21:44,541 --> 00:21:46,416
Well, what else did you expect?

447
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,958
I'll be awaiting
your arrival, Sensei.

448
00:21:51,375 --> 00:21:52,750
No, wait!

449

It pisses me off!

[MIRAI ] Oh, really?

454
00:23:38,666 --> 00:23:39,958
[HARUKA] You wear an ugly
man mask, carry a torch,

and then you hula dance
in the nude. It never fails.
