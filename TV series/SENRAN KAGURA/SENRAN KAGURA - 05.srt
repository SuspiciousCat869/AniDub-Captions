00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,916
However, if you pair a strong
mind with a capable body,

160
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,666
true skill will
start to show itself.

161
00:07:36,750 --> 00:07:39,000
In other words, it's by
standing firmly with both feet

162
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:41,625
on the ground and a focused
mind that the earth will become

163
00:07:41,708 --> 00:07:43,125
your strength, got it?

164
00:07:43,208 --> 00:07:44,833
Uh, yeah, I understand!

165
00:07:44,916 --> 00:07:46,041
[KIRIYA] Katsuragi!

166
00:07:46,125 --> 00:07:47,291
Huh?

167
00:07:47,375 --> 00:07:49,375
What's goin' on, is it
time for lunch already?

168
00:07:49,458 --> 00:07:50,916
[BOTH] She's in trouble.

169
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:51,916
[KIRIYA] Yes, she is!

170
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,625
Now, go out in the hall!

171
00:07:53,708 --> 00:07:55,416
[HARUKA] We've searched
the entire campus.

172
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,416
This is the only
possibility left.

173
00:07:57,500 --> 00:08:00,250
[YOMI] It's much older and less
lavish than the other buildings.

174
00:08:00,333 --> 00:08:01,750
[HOMURA] And it's
not in use anymore.

175
00:08:01,833 --> 00:08:05,000
It's probably still here
for historical purposes.

176
00:08:05,083 --> 00:08:08,125
[MIRAI] "Off-limits to
unauthorized personnel," huh?

177
00:08:08,208 --> 00:08:09,708
Yeah.

178
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:12,000
It looks as though we've found
their secret hideout, ladies.

179
00:08:12,083 --> 00:08:15,791
[MIRAI] I can smell
good ninja and it reeks!

180
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:17,333
Man.

181
00:08:17,416 --> 00:08:19,000
Why'd he have to send me out
in the hall for taking a nap?

182
00:08:19,083 --> 00:08:20,500
[KATSURAGI]
That's not cool at all.

183
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:22,916
And it's such a
beautiful day outside.

184
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,000
I'd rather be out there
playin' and havin' fun

185
00:08:25,083 --> 00:08:27,208
than stuck inside
this hell hole.

186
00:08:27,291 --> 00:08:29,541
[KATSURAGI] Yeah.
Like when I was a kid.

187
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:31,416
Those were the days.

188
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,250
[Young Katsuragi laughing]

189
00:08:33,333 --> 00:08:34,708
Choco!

190
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:36,416
[laughing]

191
00:08:37,541 --> 00:08:38,458
[YOUNG KATSURAGI] Wait!

192
00:08:38,541 --> 00:08:40,208
Mommy! Daddy!

193
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,375
[Choco barking]

194
00:08:43,458 --> 00:08:44,875
[NARRATOR] When
Katsuragi's parents failed

195
00:08:44,958 --> 00:08:46,333
an important mission,

196
00:08:46,416 --> 00:08:48,708
they knew that according to
shinobi law, the only way

197
00:08:48,791 --> 00:08:50,208
they could ever make up
for their failure,

198
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:52,833
would be to surrender
their lives.

199
00:08:52,916 --> 00:08:55,666
Instead, they chose to
disregard the law completely

200
00:08:55,750 --> 00:08:58,916
and went on the run to
live as fugitive ninjas.

201
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,375
They left their
young daughter behind

202
00:09:00,458 --> 00:09:03,083
so she would not be
implicated in their crimes.

203
00:09:03,166 --> 00:09:04,541
[crying]

204
00:09:04,625 --> 00:09:06,166
[NARRATOR] Katsuragi believed
that if she worked hard

205
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,541
to become a superior good ninja,
her parents' crime and flight

206
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,833
would eventually be forgiven.

207
00:09:12,416 --> 00:09:13,750
[YOUNG KATSURAGI]
Someday I'll be reunited

208
00:09:13,833 --> 00:09:15,875
with Mommy and
Daddy, I know it!

209
00:09:15,958 --> 00:09:17,875
I just have to get strong!

210
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:20,666
Stronger than
any other shinobi!

211
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,083
[KATSURAGI] Not again.

212
00:09:24,166 --> 00:09:27,291
I told myself I wasn't going
to think about them anymore.

213
00:09:27,375 --> 00:09:29,041
This sucks.

214
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,166
[Hikage sigh] I don't
understand why we're waiting.

215
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:34,500
Can't we just bust in?

216
00:09:34,583 --> 00:09:36,000
If this really is their
secret headquarters

217
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:38,541
I doubt getting inside will
be as easy as "bustin' in".

218
00:09:38,625 --> 00:09:40,625
What do you
suggest we do, Haruka?

219
00:09:40,708 --> 00:09:43,416
[chuckles] Well, first off
we'll need to eliminate

220
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,416
the most dangerous
obstacle in our way.

221
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,500
[HOMURA] We have a
mission. We're not here to

222
00:09:46,583 --> 00:09:47,916
run around in circles.

223
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,500
There's no need to worry.

224
00:09:49,583 --> 00:09:52,291
They'll be stripped bare soon
enough, I can promise you that.

225
00:09:52,375 --> 00:09:57,291
[Haruka chuckling]
[alarm]

226
00:09:57,375 --> 00:09:58,791
[alarm]

227
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,500
Oh wow! That's so loud!

228
00:10:00,583 --> 00:10:01,666
It's all right!

229
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:03,083
Somebody's triggered
the intruder alarm.

230
00:10:03,166 --> 00:10:03,958
Intruders?

231
00:10:04,041 --> 00:10:05,708
Oh no!

232
00:10:08,833 --> 00:10:10,500
[KIRIYA] They appear
to be ordinary students.

233
00:10:10,583 --> 00:10:11,708
How can you be sure?

234
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:13,666
So there's no need to worry?

235
00:10:15,166 --> 00:10:16,125
Hey, sensei.

236
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,625
Did those
idiot jocks sneak over

237
00:10:17,708 --> 00:10:19,166
and trip the friggin'
alarm again?

238
00:10:19,250 --> 00:10:20,958
[KIRIYA] It would appear so.

239
00:10:21,041 --> 00:10:22,083
[KIRIYA] Katsuragi,
that's enough.

240
00:10:22,166 --> 00:10:23,625
You may return to class now.

241
00:10:23,708 --> 00:10:24,833
Yes, sir.

242
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,166
Thank you, dumb jocks!

243
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:27,958
I dunno who you are but
because of your stupidity,

244
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:29,541
I'm off the hook!

245
00:10:29,625 --> 00:10:32,250
[cawing]

246
00:10:32,333 --> 00:10:34,208
[KIRIYA] What are
you doing in here?

247
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:37,125
[KIRIYA] Surely you two
know this area's off-limits

248
00:10:37,208 --> 00:10:38,500
to students, don't you?

249
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,375
Let me guess, you little
punks are playing hooky?

250
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:43,625
One of you wanna say something?

251
00:10:49,541 --> 00:10:51,625
[KIRIYA] You'd better
start talking or else.

252
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:55,416
Your classes
and names, please.

253
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:57,083
If you won't tell me, I'll
have to march you straight

254
00:10:57,166 --> 00:10:59,583
to the faculty office myself.

255
00:11:00,416 --> 00:11:01,791
[KIRIYA] Huh?

256
00:11:03,416 --> 00:11:04,541
They're puppets?

257
00:11:04,625 --> 00:11:06,041
No, the girls!

258
00:11:08,875 --> 00:11:09,750
What the hell?

259
00:11:09,833 --> 00:11:10,875
Something is wrong!

260
00:11:10,958 --> 00:11:12,958
Ikaruga, can you
tell what's going on?

261
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:14,333
It's a shinobi kekkai!

262
00:11:14,416 --> 00:11:15,833
What? But how?

263
00:11:15,916 --> 00:11:17,625
No. Yagyu, don't go!

264
00:11:17,708 --> 00:11:18,875
[KATSURAGI] Yagyu?

265
00:11:18,958 --> 00:11:20,083
[HIBARI] Please, come back!

266
00:11:20,166 --> 00:11:22,000
It's too dangerous!

267
00:11:22,083 --> 00:11:23,416
Let's go!

268
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,041
[IKARUGA] Is it
just this building?

269
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:26,583
No.

270
00:11:26,666 --> 00:11:29,666
The entire academy has been
enveloped in a shinobi kekkai!

271
00:11:29,750 --> 00:11:31,041
[KATSURAGI] This is insane!

272
00:11:31,125 --> 00:11:33,666
How could one person
put up a barrier this big?

273
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,250
[IKARUGA] I don't
think this is one person.

274
00:11:35,333 --> 00:11:37,666
The only explanation is that
a group of shinobi each raised

275
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:39,958
a barrier at the same time
and then combined them!

276
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,541
I didn't even know
that was possible.

277
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,250
I've never seen it
with my own eyes before

278
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:45,500
but I've read books about
shinobi who have the ability

279
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,791
to pull it off.
And I remember...

280
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,916
one of them
was puppet masters.

281
00:11:50,833 --> 00:11:52,625
You mean like the
one who attacked us?

282
00:11:52,708 --> 00:11:53,833
[HIBARI] That was
the scariest thing

283
00:11:53,916 --> 00:11:55,958
that's ever happened to me.

284
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:59,125
I bet those shinobi from Hebijo
Girl's Academy are behind this!

285
00:11:59,208 --> 00:12:00,833
Yeah, and I suspect
they're the ones who

286
00:12:00,916 --> 00:12:02,250
tripped the alarm earlier.

287
00:12:02,333 --> 00:12:03,708
[KATSURAGI] 'Cause they
wanted to separate us

288
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:05,541
from Kiriya-sensei!

289
00:12:06,625 --> 00:12:07,625
[KIRIYA] Damn it!

290
00:12:07,708 --> 00:12:09,875
An evil ninja sneak attack!

291
00:12:17,375 --> 00:12:19,375
Be careful. The evil
ninja are here somewhere

292
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:20,958
merging their kekkai barriers.

293
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,500
We have to stop them fast.

294
00:12:22,583 --> 00:12:24,625
If we don't figure out a way
to pull them apart, somehow,

295
00:12:24,708 --> 00:12:25,875
then we're sitting ducks.

296
00:12:25,958 --> 00:12:27,250
They wanna go "fist-a-cuffs"?

297
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:28,666
Well, that's just fine by me!

298
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,875
I'm so scared.

299
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,500
No, don't be. 'Cause
I'll always protect you,

300
00:12:31,583 --> 00:12:32,541
no matter what.

301
00:12:32,625 --> 00:12:34,916
Everybody, prepare
for battle, now!

302
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:40,750
[IKARUGA] Shinobi
Transformation!

303
00:12:40,833 --> 00:12:42,791
[ASUKA] Shinobi Transformation!

304
00:12:43,791 --> 00:12:46,416
[KATSURAGI] Shinobi
Transformation!

305
00:12:47,333 --> 00:12:49,041
[YAGYU] Shinobi Transformation.

306
00:12:49,791 --> 00:12:51,916
[HIBARI] Shinobi Transformation!

307
00:12:55,958 --> 00:12:57,833
[KATSURAGI] Come out, come out,
wherever you are!

308
00:12:57,916 --> 00:13:00,000
Well? Dontcha wanna play?

309
00:13:00,083 --> 00:13:01,458
Wait, Katsuragi!

310
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:03,416
What the hell's your problem?

311
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,458
We're inside the
enemy's shinobi kekkai.

312
00:13:05,541 --> 00:13:07,625
It's dangerous to recklessly
charge ahead like that.

313
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,291
Not as dangerous as sittin'
around waiting to be attacked!

314
00:13:10,375 --> 00:13:13,791
I agree, but first we need to
know what the enemy's doing!

315
00:13:13,875 --> 00:13:18,125
[chuckles] And now it's time

477
00:20:12,333 --> 00:20:14,166
[HIBARI] I could
use your help Yagyu!

478
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:16,500
Shinobi Transformation.

479
00:20:21,833 --> 00:20:24,166
[Yagyu gasp]

480
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:26,458
Hibari must be in
a different kekkai.

[heavy breathing]

482
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,375
You've got some legs on you,

483
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,583
but you're not fast enough
to outrun me, ya hussy!

484
00:20:32,666 --> 00:20:34,708
If I can take her down
then I might be able

485
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:36,416
to move into another kekkai.

486
00:20:36,500 --> 00:20:39,166
Why're you ignoring me and
acting like you're not afraid?!

487
00:20:39,250 --> 00:20:41,416
Ah! All right, at least
you seem ready to face me

488
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:42,833
in one-on-one combat now.

489
00:20:42,916 --> 00:20:45,083
But, I'm in a hurry, so
we'll have to make it quick.

490
00:20:45,166 --> 00:20:48,000
You have got some nerve
to make such demands of me!

491
00:20:48,083 --> 00:20:49,791
Ah! Screw this!

492
00:20:49,875 --> 00:20:51,541
[MIRAI] Secret Ninja Art.

493
00:20:51,625 --> 00:20:53,666
Valkyrie, go!

494
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:55,375
[MIRAI] Ignore me, will ya?

495
00:20:55,458 --> 00:20:56,833
You're gonna pay!

496
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:06,333
[MAN] Are you telling me
this mission is no longer for

497
00:21:06,416 --> 00:21:09,833
the purpose of stealing their
super secret ninja art scroll?

498
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:12,666
[SUZUNE] No, this mission is
laying the groundwork for that.

499
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:15,125
I personally trained the
elite five and helped them

500
00:21:15,208 --> 00:21:17,041
hone their skills as shinobi.

501
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,208
There is no cause for concern.

502
00:21:20,458 --> 00:21:23,458
[MAN] It is said that the
evil ninja's Scroll of Yin,

503
00:21:23,541 --> 00:21:26,708
and the good ninja's Scroll,
the scroll of Yang,

504
00:21:26,791 --> 00:21:29,166
were originally one.

505
00:21:29,250 --> 00:21:31,291
Let me remind you,
it is our destiny

506
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:33,458
to combine the
scrolls once again.

507
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,000
We've waited a long time
for this and I will not rest

508
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,750
until it is done.

509
00:21:37,833 --> 00:21:39,791
[SUZUNE]
I understand completely.

510
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,375
[SUZUNE] He talks about
"our destiny" but I know

511
00:21:50,458 --> 00:21:55,125
he's concerned with fulfilling
his own selfish desires. Hm!

512
00:21:56,541 --> 00:21:58,916
[SUZUNE] He's such
a vulgar snob.

[ASUKA] Homura,
you're the enemy?

00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:34,625
[HOMURA] Are you surprised?

[ASUKA] Yeah!

[HOMURA] Well, here's
a bigger surprise.

518
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:38,250
I go to the tanning
salon to give my skin
