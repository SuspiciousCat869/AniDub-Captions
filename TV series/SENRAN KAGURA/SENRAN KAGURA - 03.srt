00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:38,958
[explosion]

159
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:41,500
[all coughing]

160
00:07:41,583 --> 00:07:43,791
Sorry for holding up dinner.

161
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,458
So, what caused you to be late?

162
00:07:49,541 --> 00:07:50,791
A phone call.

163
00:07:50,875 --> 00:07:52,666
Ikaruga's family is
quite frantic at the moment.

164
00:07:52,750 --> 00:07:54,166
Is everything all right?

165
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:56,041
You guys got attacked
by an evil ninja?

166
00:07:56,125 --> 00:07:57,291
So what was she like?

167
00:07:57,375 --> 00:07:58,708
Well, I dunno.

168
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:00,416
She was really
snobby and frilly.

169
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,500
That's not what I meant.

170
00:08:01,583 --> 00:08:03,083
Like, was she super strong?

171
00:08:03,166 --> 00:08:04,916
Oh yeah. There's no
way I could've fought her

172
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,333
on my own. She totally
would've kicked my butt.

173
00:08:07,416 --> 00:08:10,083
I'm sorry I wasn't strong
enough to help you, Ikaruga.

174
00:08:10,166 --> 00:08:11,875
It's okay. I'm
the one who ordered you

175
00:08:11,958 --> 00:08:13,250
to stay clear of the fight.

176
00:08:13,333 --> 00:08:15,791
[KATSURAGI] No way! So
it was just you against her?

177
00:08:15,875 --> 00:08:18,750
Yeah! You knocked that
hoe-bag's teeth in, didn't ya?

178
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:21,375
No, I simply refused
to continue fighting her.

179
00:08:21,458 --> 00:08:24,625
As shinobi, it is our duty to
avoid pointless altercations.

180
00:08:24,708 --> 00:08:26,708
Geez. If it had
been me, I would've

181
00:08:26,791 --> 00:08:29,666
manhandled that evil skank!
Watch, I'll show you!

182
00:08:29,750 --> 00:08:30,875
[KATSURAGI]
C'mere you evil doer!

183
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,125
[ASUKA] What's with you?

184
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:33,416
[KATSURAGI] I'm gonna
squeeze the evil out!

185
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,166
[KATSURAGI] Gimme
those wicked wobblies!

186
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:38,166
[IKARUGA] I lied. I
didn't refuse to fight her.

187
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,166
I knew I wasn't
strong enough to win.

188
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:41,166
[KIRIYA] Ikaruga.

189
00:08:41,250 --> 00:08:42,208
Yes, sir?

190
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,458
May I have a moment?

191
00:08:43,541 --> 00:08:44,916
[IKARUGA] Sure.

192
00:08:46,083 --> 00:08:47,125
Is somethin' wrong?

193
00:08:47,208 --> 00:08:49,416
Don't worry.
Just finish your dinner.

194
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:50,708
[Hibari sigh]
[YAGYU] Hm.

195
00:08:50,791 --> 00:08:52,125
[HANZO] How cute!

196
00:08:52,208 --> 00:08:54,291
I can tell that you girls
are really good friends.

197
00:08:54,375 --> 00:08:56,208
Yeah, we're the
bestest friends ever.

198
00:08:56,291 --> 00:08:57,333
Aren't we, Yagyu?

199
00:08:57,416 --> 00:08:59,041
I just do my best
to keep Hibari safe

200
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,916
because she's always
getting into trouble.

201
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,125
[HIBARI] That's not true!
Quit treating me like a baby!

202
00:09:04,208 --> 00:09:06,708
She's just worried
because she cares about you.

203
00:09:06,791 --> 00:09:08,416
Now tell me, are
you girls so close

204
00:09:08,500 --> 00:09:09,833
that you take baths together?

205
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:11,416
Yes, sir!

206
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:13,916
[HIBARI] We even wash each
other's backs and everything!

207
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,208
Well, if you girls
ever need help

208
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,875
I'm an excellent back washer!

209
00:09:17,958 --> 00:09:19,041
Didn't I tell you?

210
00:09:19,125 --> 00:09:20,458
No perving out over
my friends, Grandpa!

211
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,875
I'm not "pervin' out".

212
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:24,541
I'm simply offering my
services to these young ladies.

213
00:09:24,625 --> 00:09:25,750
[KATSURAGI] Master Hanzo
suffers from the same

214
00:09:25,833 --> 00:09:27,666
disease I do, funbag-itis!

215
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,791
[ASUKA] Ahhh!

216
00:09:29,875 --> 00:09:32,500
[Hanzo chuckling]

217
00:09:32,583 --> 00:09:34,666
[IKARUGA] What do you mean
my brother's gone missing?

218
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:36,000
Your family called earlier.

219
00:09:36,083 --> 00:09:37,625
They can't find him anywhere
and they were hoping

220
00:09:37,708 --> 00:09:39,291
you might know
his whereabouts.

221
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,333
Why do they think I
would know where he is?

222
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,041
My brother and I
don't really talk,

223
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:44,541
and we've never
been all that close.

224
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:45,375
[KIRIYA] I see.

225
00:09:45,458 --> 00:09:46,625
[IKARUGA] I'm sorry.

226
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:47,916
[KIRIYA] Oh, no. Don't
apologize, I just wanted

227
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,750
to ask in case you
happened to know something.

228
00:09:49,833 --> 00:09:51,750
They are your
family, after all.

229
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,958
My family. Yes, of course.

230
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,666
[grunt]

231
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,666
Gonna stand out
here all night?

232
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,000
No. I felt like
someone was watching me.

233
00:10:09,083 --> 00:10:10,458
What?

234
00:10:11,416 --> 00:10:12,791
[HIBARI] Huh?

235
00:10:13,958 --> 00:10:16,458
[ASUKA] Well, I
don't see anybody.

236
00:10:16,541 --> 00:10:19,000
I'm sorry I guess that
it was just my imagination.

237
00:10:19,083 --> 00:10:20,541
But you're usually spot-on.

238
00:10:20,625 --> 00:10:21,958
We all have our off days.

239
00:10:22,041 --> 00:10:23,250
So, we've got half an hour

240
00:10:23,333 --> 00:10:24,833
and then it's
time to hit the sack.

241
00:10:24,916 --> 00:10:26,375
[ASUKA] Yes ma'am!
[HIBARI] Gotcha!

242
00:10:26,458 --> 00:10:29,000
[KATSURAGI] What kinda party
ends before the sun comes up?

243
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,041
[IKARUGA] The evil ninja
attack and the disappearance

244
00:10:31,125 --> 00:10:34,625
of my brother must be
making me a little jumpy.

245
00:10:38,125 --> 00:10:39,416
[IKARUGA'S FATHER] As
of today, she is a member

246
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,208
of our immediate family.

247
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,208
Say hello to
your brother, dear.

248
00:10:43,291 --> 00:10:44,958
Hi. Nice to meet you.

249
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,916
So tell me somethin'.

250
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,041
How much money did
my old man pay for you?

251
00:10:50,125 --> 00:10:51,500
[IKARUGA'S FATHER] Watch
your mouth, Murasame!

252
00:10:51,583 --> 00:10:53,333
She's a distant relative.

253
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:55,250
[MURASAME] Yeah,
whatever you say.

254
00:10:55,333 --> 00:10:56,708
[gasp]

255
00:10:56,791 --> 00:10:58,083
[MURASAME] Like it matters.
It doesn't change the fact

256
00:10:58,166 --> 00:10:59,833
that you've
forsaken me, Father.

257
00:10:59,916 --> 00:11:01,708
[IKARUGA'S FATHER]
That's enough out of you!

258
00:11:03,333 --> 00:11:04,708
[chuckles]

259
00:11:11,250 --> 00:11:12,458
[IKARUGA] I think he hates me.

260
00:11:12,541 --> 00:11:13,875
[IKARUGA'S FATHER]
Don't worry about him.

261
00:11:13,958 --> 00:11:16,458
There are times when we
are forced to be resolute,

262
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,291
even with our
own flesh and blood.

263
00:11:18,375 --> 00:11:20,416
That is the
law of the shinobi.

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,416
[Ikaruga shaky gasp]

265
00:11:27,666 --> 00:11:28,833
[IKARUGA] What is this?

266
00:11:28,916 --> 00:11:30,166
[IKARUGA'S FATHER]
Hien. A sword that's been

267
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,166
in our family for generations.

268
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:35,041
Now I'm handing it
down to you, my daughter.

269
00:11:35,125 --> 00:11:38,125
[IKARUGA] To me?
Thank you, Father!

270
00:11:46,291 --> 00:11:48,333
[NARRATOR] After realizing
their son, Murasame,

271
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,041
wasn't cut out to be a ninja,

272
00:11:50,125 --> 00:11:51,625
Ikaruga's family adopted her

273
00:11:51,708 --> 00:11:54,458
to carry on their
shinobi bloodline.

274
00:11:54,541 --> 00:11:57,791
[IKARUGA] Brother.
Why did you run away?

275
00:12:06,583 --> 00:12:07,958
[Ikaruga gasp]

276
00:12:13,250 --> 00:12:14,250
Who's there?

277
00:12:14,333 --> 00:12:16,625
[MURASAME] Well,
well, aren't you slick?

278
00:12:18,875 --> 00:12:21,208
Brother, it's you!

279
00:12:21,291 --> 00:12:23,125
Long time no see.

280
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:34,041
[IKARUGA] Brother.
What're you doing here?

281
00:12:34,125 --> 00:12:35,291
Why do you
keep calling me that?

282
00:12:35,375 --> 00:12:37,250
It's not like you're
my actual little sister.

283
00:12:37,333 --> 00:12:39,125
[IKARUGA] What do you think
you're doing with Hien?

284
00:12:39,208 --> 00:12:40,500
[MURASAME] What's
it matter to you?

285
00:12:40,583 --> 00:12:42,708
This sword belongs
to my family,

286
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:44,458
which means I can do
whatever I want with it.

287
00:12:44,541 --> 00:12:45,625
No, you cannot!

288
00:12:45,708 --> 00:12:48,125
Hien was given to
me by our father and--

289
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:50,208
By our father, huh?

290
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,416
Wow, you've sure got
some nerve, guttersnipe.

291
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,458
You're not a real
member of our family.

292
00:12:54,541 --> 00:12:55,958
Dad wrote me
off when he realized

293
00:12:56,041 --> 00:12:58,208
I'd never be a
shinobi. That's fine.

294
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,416
But I'm not going to let
you take this sword from me.

295
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:02,333
I can't stand the
thought of a family heirloom

296
00:13:02,416 --> 00:13:04,458
in the hands of
an outsider, like you!

297
00:13:04,541 --> 00:13:07,791
If you hadn't been adopted,
Hien would've been mine someday.

298
00:13:07,875 --> 00:13:11,708
It's all your fault! You
ruined everything for me!

299
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:14,250
I've always felt bad about
how everything worked out.

300
00:13:14,333 --> 00:13:15,291
[MURASAME] What?

301
00:13:15,375 --> 00:13:16,958
I totally understand
if you hate me,

302
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,458
but I never meant to hurt you.

303
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:19,791
[MURASAME] Yeah, right!

304
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,375
You're just trying to
make me look like a fool!

305
00:13:21,458 --> 00:13:23,416
I swear I'm not doing
anything of the sort.

306
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,000
I simply want Hien back.

307
00:13:25,083 --> 00:13:27,375
Then come here
and take it from me!

308
00:13:30,208 --> 00:13:31,583
Damn!

309
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:34,458
Okay, now
you're askin' for it!

310
00:13:34,541 --> 00:13:36,416
I took sixth place at
the chain-sickle tournament

311
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,875
back in grade school!

312

00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:20,500
I lied! I'm totally scared!

468
00:19:20,583 --> 00:19:21,958

Gotta save the frog!

471
00:19:40,458 --> 00:19:41,833
[Asuka] Huh?

472
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:48,083
Geez, Ikaruga! Why'd you
go and scare me like that?

473
00:19:48,166 --> 00:19:49,583
Sorry, but it's
the only way I could

474
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:51,875
get you to
touch the little guy.

475
00:19:56,208 --> 00:19:57,291
I thought he
was gonna be crushed

476
00:19:57,375 --> 00:20:00,208
by that falling
rock so I rescued him.

477
00:20:00,291 --> 00:20:02,541
You aren't scared
anymore, are you?

478
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,750
That's weird.
I'm not scared at all.

479
00:20:04,833 --> 00:20:08,750
I dunno... why though.
But the more I look at him,

480
00:20:08,833 --> 00:20:11,958
[ASUKA] he's kinda cute. I
can't believe I just said that.

481
00:20:12,041 --> 00:20:14,500
I knew you'd be fine as
soon as you touched him.

482

You're the type who sees
the beauty in everything.

Art! Double Sword Slice!

I did it!

487
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:49,541
[KATSURAGI] That's awesome!

488
00:20:49,625 --> 00:20:51,333
[HIBARI] Yeah, no kidding!

489
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,875
I must say I'm impressed.

490
00:20:52,958 --> 00:20:55,583
That was flawless!
You did great!

491
00:20:55,666 --> 00:20:57,208
Good work, Asuka.

492
00:20:57,291 --> 00:21:00,208
Hey Grandpa! Pretty
good for my first time, huh?

493
00:21:00,291 --> 00:21:02,041
[HANZO] Yep! I'm proud of you!

494
00:21:02,125 --> 00:21:03,375
[KIRIYA] I would really
love to know what you did

495
00:21:03,458 --> 00:21:05,750
to help her conquer her
fear of frogs, Ikaruga.

496
00:21:05,833 --> 00:21:07,666
To be honest, it
wasn't all that hard to do

497
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:09,541
because she's a good person.

498
00:21:09,625 --> 00:21:11,125
She'd convinced
herself that she was

499
00:21:11,208 --> 00:21:13,166
afraid of frogs without
ever being around them,

500
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:15,375
so I just had to get
her to interact with one.

501
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:17,166
[IKARUGA] I made it seem
as though a frog was in danger

502
00:21:17,250 --> 00:21:18,750
knowing that she'd save it.

503
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:20,666
Once she touched it,
her fear was gone.

504
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:22,833
[KIRIYA] That's amazing.
I'm so glad the girls

505
00:21:22,916 --> 00:21:24,208
have you to help them.

506
00:21:24,291 --> 00:21:25,875
You even put me to shame.

509
00:21:30,083 --> 00:21:32,875
Master Hanzo. Thanks
for reminding me of that.

510
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,625
Don't be silly! I
should be thanking you

511
00:21:34,708 --> 00:21:37,083
for going above and
beyond your duties.

512
00:21:38,208 --> 00:21:40,791
I hope the girls realize how
lucky they are to have you.

513
00:21:40,875 --> 00:21:43,416
You are so much more than
just their leader, Ikaruga.

514
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:45,041
You're like a
big sister to them.

515
00:21:45,125 --> 00:21:47,125
A... sister?
