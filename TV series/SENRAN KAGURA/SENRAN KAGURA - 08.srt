00:09:06,416 --> 00:09:08,666
This barrier is going
to become our grave.

161
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:12,625
That's not gonna happen.

162
00:09:12,708 --> 00:09:14,750
Katsuragi. I--

163
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,833
We're gonna get outta here
but we have to work together

164
00:09:16,916 --> 00:09:18,333
to make that happen, okay?

165
00:09:18,416 --> 00:09:19,291
Together?

166
00:09:19,375 --> 00:09:20,416
Follow my lead,

167
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,458
and start kicking
like a crazy person.

168
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:24,791
Are you really not
afraid or just faking it?

169
00:09:24,875 --> 00:09:27,750
I'd be a piss poor shinobi
if I let death bother me.

170
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,416
[KATSURAGI] If I can escape,
great. If not, oh well.

171
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:34,208
You don't blame me
for trapping you in here?

172
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:35,833
You crack me up, Ikaruga.

173
00:09:35,916 --> 00:09:38,291
Why would I blame you for
something you couldn't control?

174
00:09:38,375 --> 00:09:39,458
Huh?

175
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,041
It sounds like you're
asking for blame.

176
00:09:41,125 --> 00:09:43,375
And that can be
a rough burden to carry.

177
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:46,583
[KATSURAGI] Shit happens.
Just work to make it right.

178
00:09:46,666 --> 00:09:48,458
[KATSURAGI] I think I've
finally figured you out.

179
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:49,625
[IKARUGA] What?

180
00:09:49,708 --> 00:09:51,708
In a way, you and
I are pretty similar.

181
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:52,916
What do you mean?

182
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,791
We both have a tendency
to be total klutzes.

183
00:09:55,875 --> 00:09:57,458
Maybe that's
why we butt heads.

184
00:09:57,541 --> 00:09:59,791
We see the same things in each
other that we try to hide

185
00:09:59,875 --> 00:10:01,875
from everyone else in the world.

186
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,833
[KATSURAGI] So we lash out,

187
00:10:03,916 --> 00:10:06,333
act childish, and
become social shut-ins.

188
00:10:06,416 --> 00:10:08,208
We let our insecurities
take hold and we

189
00:10:08,291 --> 00:10:11,166
end up sabotaging what could've
been a kick-ass friendship.

190
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,333
Oh, Katsuragi. I'm sorry.

191
00:10:15,208 --> 00:10:18,000
Well, that's not
coming down anytime soon.

192
00:10:18,083 --> 00:10:19,333
Ikaruga?

193
00:10:19,416 --> 00:10:21,541
If we give up we might
as well be dead, right?

194
00:10:21,625 --> 00:10:23,541
Yeah. Whaddya
say we show this wall

195
00:10:23,625 --> 00:10:25,541
what two shinobi can do?

196
00:10:25,625 --> 00:10:26,958
Sounds good to me.

197
00:10:27,041 --> 00:10:28,666
Let's get freaky.

198
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:37,083
[both power yell]

199
00:10:38,458 --> 00:10:39,833
[crash]

200
00:10:48,541 --> 00:10:50,083
[KATSURAGI] Kiriya-sensei!

201
00:10:50,166 --> 00:10:52,083
I seem to recall
forbidding you from creating

202
00:10:52,166 --> 00:10:54,416
a kekkai barrier
outside of practice.

203
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,333
Wait. How did you bring it down?

204
00:10:56,416 --> 00:10:57,708
I thought only
I could do that!

205
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:58,791
A better question would be

206
00:10:58,875 --> 00:11:00,791
why you did it
in the first place.

207
00:11:01,875 --> 00:11:03,208
[KIRIYA] As punishment,
you'll wait out

208
00:11:03,291 --> 00:11:04,958
in the hall until sunrise.

209
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:06,250
[KATSURAGI] Wait, sunrise?

210
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:08,708
But it's just now sunset!

211
00:11:10,708 --> 00:11:12,625
[KATSURAGI] This is a little
excessive don't ya think?

212
00:11:12,708 --> 00:11:14,375
I didn't-- I'm sorry.

213
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,375
For what? Doesn't bother me.

214
00:11:16,458 --> 00:11:18,958
I get some exercise and
I get to watch the star pupil

215
00:11:19,041 --> 00:11:20,500
let it all hang out.

216
00:11:20,583 --> 00:11:22,250
Just don't tell anyone!

217
00:11:23,333 --> 00:11:24,625
Well, anyway.

218
00:11:24,708 --> 00:11:27,000
I hope we get some new
students at the school soon.

219
00:11:27,083 --> 00:11:28,333
Hell yeah.

220
00:11:28,416 --> 00:11:30,250
The more friends we have,
the more fun it will be.

221
00:11:30,333 --> 00:11:32,083
Yes, I agree.

222
00:11:32,166 --> 00:11:33,708
[IKARUGA] Friends.

223
00:11:33,791 --> 00:11:34,833
[KATSURAGI] I hope
we get a girl who's more

224
00:11:34,916 --> 00:11:36,750
grope-worthy
than somebody I know.

225
00:11:36,833 --> 00:11:39,541
Hey! Are you implying
that I'm subpar?

226
00:11:40,416 --> 00:11:43,125
Well, honestly, your
shino-boobs could be bigger.

227
00:11:49,208 --> 00:11:53,708
[birds chirping]

228
00:11:54,458 --> 00:11:57,333
[IKARUGA]
Shinobi Transformation!

229
00:12:03,375 --> 00:12:04,500
Well done, Ikaruga.

230
00:12:04,583 --> 00:12:06,333
That was a flawlessly
performed technique.

231
00:12:06,416 --> 00:12:08,583
This state reflects your
inner self and amplifies

232
00:12:08,666 --> 00:12:10,708
your strength to its
full potential in battle.

233
00:12:10,791 --> 00:12:12,666
Wow, I like
your "inner self".

234
00:12:12,750 --> 00:12:15,375
Stop. Don't
look at me like that.

235
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:17,416
Katsuragi! Show us your stuff.

236
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,916
You got it, boss!

237
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:23,333
Time for your shot, big boy.

238
00:12:23,416 --> 00:12:26,083
Hey! What kind of stupid
transformation is that?

239
00:12:26,166 --> 00:12:27,833
I've always wanted
to cosplay a nurse.

240
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:29,291
Don't you think I look hot?

241
00:12:29,375 --> 00:12:30,708
Would you please get serious?

242
00:12:30,791 --> 00:12:32,333
Technically there
aren't any rules restricting

243
00:12:32,416 --> 00:12:33,500
that type of clothing that--

244
00:12:33,583 --> 00:12:34,791
Kiriya-sensei!

245
00:12:35,875 --> 00:12:37,083
[KIRIYA] Katsuragi.
Your clothing choice

246
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,916
should allow for
mobility in combat.

247
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,291
That outfit is hardly suited
for strenuous activity.

248
00:12:41,375 --> 00:12:42,583
Then I'll try again!

249
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,750
[KATSURAGI]
Shinobi Transformation!

250
00:12:44,833 --> 00:12:46,750
This should be easier
to kick some ass in, huh?

251
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:48,208
Oh no you don't!

252
00:12:48,291 --> 00:12:50,208
I refuse to fight alongside
someone dressed like that!

253
00:12:50,291 --> 00:12:52,125
[KATSURAGI] You are
such a Debbie-downer.

254
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:55,041
[KATSURAGI] Well,
I guess this should do it.

255
00:12:55,125 --> 00:12:56,666
The two of you have
worked incredibly hard

256
00:12:56,750 --> 00:12:59,666
this past year, and your ability
to transform is proof of that.

257
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:02,250
Please help your underclassman
achieve the same results.

258
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:04,083
[BOTH] Underclassman?

259
00:13:05,208 --> 00:13:07,958
[ASUKA] I'm gonna be late
on the very first day!

260
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,833
Here it is!

261
00:13:11,375 --> 00:13:13,541
[ASUKA] Okay so I go
through this tearoom.

262
00:13:13,625 --> 00:13:15,000
Or maybe it was--?

263
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,500
Ahhh!

264
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:21,666
[KIRIYA] Welcome.

265
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,916
As you may have
guessed, this young lady

266
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:28,166
is Hanzo Academy's
newest student and she'll be

267
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,625
training with you from now on.

268
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:31,750
My name's Asuka!

269
00:13:31,833 --> 00:13:33,166
A big-boobed newb!

270
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:34,750
That's just what
I was hoping for!

271
00:13:34,833 --> 00:13:36,750
Don't start molesting
her on the first day.

272
00:13:36,833 --> 00:13:38,875
[KIRIYA] Incidentally, Asuka
is also the granddaughter

273
00:13:38,958 --> 00:13:40,250
of Master Hanzo.

274
00:13:40,333 --> 00:13:41,625
She's the granddaughter--

275
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,333
Of the legendary shinobi?

276
00:13:43,958 --> 00:13:46,625
Yeah. It's a pleasure
to meet you both.

277
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,166
[ASUKA] Ahhh!

278
00:13:52,500 --> 00:13:54,750
That didn't go so well.

279
00:13:55,375 --> 00:13:57,541
[KATSURAGI] I guess being
legendary isn't hereditary.

280
00:13:57,625 --> 00:13:59,208
Maybe she's just nervous.

281
00:13:59,291 --> 00:14:00,291
[IKARUGA] Perhaps.

282
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:02,208
She puts on a good show.

283
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:04,833
I think she'll
fit in just fine.

284
00:14:04,916 --> 00:14:06,291
I guess.

285
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:10,750
[KATSURAGI] You've got
a lot of bruises.

286
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:12,125
You gonna be okay there, newbie?

287
00:14:12,208 --> 00:14:13,291
[ASUKA] Oh yeah, you bet!

288
00:14:13,375 --> 00:14:14,458
This is nothing!

289
00:14:14,541 --> 00:14:15,708
[KATSURAGI] So
there's a warrior's heart

290
00:14:15,791 --> 00:14:17,208
behind these fun bags!

291
00:14:17,291 --> 00:14:18,458
Ahhh!

292
00:14:18,541 --> 00:14:20,250
Hey, what do you
think you're doing?

293
00:14:20,333 --> 00:14:22,333
Giving those bruises some TLC.

294
00:14:22,416 --> 00:14:23,750
Huh?

295
00:14:23,833 --> 00:14:25,333
[ASUKA] Somehow I don't
think that's going to heal them

296
00:14:25,416 --> 00:14:28,666
any faster! I'm through
bathing. Goodnight!

297
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:33,041
I think I found
a new groping buddy.

298
00:14:33,125 --> 00:14:35,083
She's nothing like us.

299
00:14:35,458 --> 00:14:37,541
Great things are
expected of that girl.

300
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:40,583
I'm sure success will be handed
to her on a silver platter.

301
00:14:40,666 --> 00:14:42,750
[IKARUGA] Especially
because of her grandfather.

302
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:44,125
Her life must be easy.

303
00:14:44,208 --> 00:14:45,125
I don't believe it.

304
00:14:45,208 --> 00:14:47,541
Are you jealous of her, Ikaruga?

305
00:14:51,458 --> 00:14:53,208
[KIRIYA] Asuka! You
have to pick up the pace!

306
00:14:53,291 --> 00:14:54,541
[ASUKA] Right!

307
00:14:54,625 --> 00:14:56,000
[IKARUGA] I was resented
for showing even a glimpse

308
00:14:56,083 --> 00:14:57,500
of my talent back home.

309
00:14:57,583 --> 00:14:59,375
She is attending the
finest shinobi school

310
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:02,500
in the country and still
can't manage to show any?

311
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:04,291
[ASUKA] Ahhh!

312
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,250
[KATSURAGI] Asuka!

313
00:15:07,333 --> 00:15:09,375
Asuka, don't come any closer!

314
00:15:13,625 --> 00:15:14,833
[KIRIYA] Be thankful
this was just training

315
00:15:14,916 --> 00:15:16,291
and not the real deal.

316
00:15:16,375 --> 00:15:17,958
I'm sorry about that, you guys.

317
00:15:18,041 --> 00:15:19,791
Yeah, yeah, no worries.

318

[KIRIYA] Asuka, where did
those clothes come from?

319
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,583
[ASUKA] What happened?

320
00:15:24,666 --> 00:15:26,750
I wasn't wearing this earlier.

321
00:15:26,833 --> 00:15:28,291
Wait a minute, this is
the really nice looking

322

school uniform I saw the
other day! That's so weird!

323
00:15:31,083 --> 00:15:33,500
[IKARUGA] Did she unconsciously
trigger a Shinobi Transformation

324
00:15:33,583 --> 00:15:35,666
with no effort at all?

325
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:37,375
[ASUKA] I can't
do anything right.

326
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,083
You gotta be kiddin' me.

327
00:15:39,166 --> 00:15:40,666
We went through a
whole year of training

328
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,541
before we were
able to transform.

329
00:15:42,625 --> 00:15:44,500
Well, I doubt I'll
be able to do it again.

330
00:15:44,583 --> 00:15:46,166
To be honest, I don't
have the slightest clue

331
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:47,416
how I even pulled it off.

332
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,625
[IKARUGA]
Still. You have talent.

333
00:15:49,708 --> 00:15:50,833
Of course she does, silly.

334
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:53,000
She's the granddaughter
of Master Hanzo.

335
00:15:53,083 --> 00:15:54,583
You say that, but I
don't feel like I'm doing

336
00:15:54,666 --> 00:15:56,333
his name any justice.

337
00:15:56,416 --> 00:15:59,333
I have to succeed, not
just for the sake of Grandpa,

338
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:02,375
but for myself. I'm
gonna try my very best.

339
00:16:02,458 --> 00:16:03,916
That's my path.

340

Asuka.

341

Keep up that
attitude and I guarantee

342

victory will be yours!

343

[ASUKA] You think so?

344
00:16:10,416 --> 00:16:13,750
[IKARUGA] I see. So
she is like us, after all.

345
00:16:13,833 --> 00:16:15,291
Well, that settles it.

think of you as my big sisters!

That's incorrect.

It's a flying squid.

[ASUKA] Huh? Oh, you don't say.

357

Hi. I hope that we can
all become good friends.

Aw, they're both
absolutely precious!

00:16:49,625 --> 00:16:52,583
And now that they're here, I'm
not gonna be the newbie anymore!

363

 She hasn't
even had any training

366
00:17:04,291 --> 00:17:05,708
and she's already amazing!

367
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,041
Most impressive.
This should be interesting.

[IKARUGA] Then there's her.

371

[ASUKA] Well, at least she's
still managing to avoid them.

[KIRIYA] Stop running away,
You should be dodging!

373

[HIBARI] But I don't understand
the difference, Sensei!

You've got some wicked skills.

Hey!

[IKARUGA] Stop right there!

378
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:40,083
It's an underclassman's duty to
clean up before leaving class!

[HIBARI] Yagyu.

380
00:17:41,416 --> 00:17:43,916
That one has some
kinda nerve, doesn't she?

381
00:17:44,625 --> 00:17:46,708
Skill means
everything to a shinobi.

382

Huh?

383
00:17:48,083 --> 00:17:49,416
Therefore the ones
with the least skill should

[IKARUGA] Don't
walk away from me!

You can't ignore the rules just
because you feel like it!

blow a fuse, Ikaruga!

[IKARUGA] Look at me
when I'm talking to you!

389
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,583
As class chairman, I
should not have to tolerate

390
00:18:03,666 --> 00:18:05,833
that kind of impertinence
from a junior student.

gonna heat up around here.

really a nice person though.

At least she gets along
really well with Hibari.

But Yagyu was eventually
able to break out of

Nah. I have way too
much fun annoying you,

00:23:33,791 --> 00:23:35,625
We finally get the
chance to do a preview!

474
00:23:35,708 --> 00:23:37,125
[HIKAGE] Woo hoo.

475
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,041
[YOMI] I would like to take
this opportunity to express

476
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:39,583
the true majesty of sprouts!

477
00:23:39,666 --> 00:23:40,708
[HIKAGE] Um, Yomi?
[YOMI] Yes?

478
00:23:40,791 --> 00:23:41,916
[HIKAGE] We don't
have time for that.

479
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,416
[YOMI] But--

480
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:44,833
[HIKAGE] Next time, "Hebijo
Clandestine Girls' Academy".

481
00:23:44,916 --> 00:23:46,833
[YOMI] Come and get it
like your life depends on it!
