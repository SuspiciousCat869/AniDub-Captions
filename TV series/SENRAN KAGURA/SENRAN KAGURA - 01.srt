but I wish he'd lay
off the smoke bombs.

158
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:16,208
His methods
may be old-fashioned

159
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:17,416
but he's a great teacher.

160
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,875
Every shinobi's
got their own thing.

161
00:09:18,958 --> 00:09:20,333
Guess his is smoke bombs.

162
00:09:20,416 --> 00:09:23,041
Hmm. So, what's
your schtick, Asuka?

163
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,041
Lemme guess, you
suffocate all your enemies

164
00:09:25,125 --> 00:09:26,833
with your big boobies!

165
00:09:26,916 --> 00:09:28,958
[ASUKA] Leave me alone!
You're embarrassing me!

166
00:09:29,041 --> 00:09:30,625
[KATSURAGI] Don't be embarrassed
of your tig-ol-bitties!

167
00:09:30,708 --> 00:09:32,541
[IKARUGA] Quit goofing off!
We've got to get to training.

168
00:09:32,625 --> 00:09:34,125
[ASUKA AND KATSURAGI]
Yes, ma'am.

169
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,416
Do we have to go?

170
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,958
[YAGYU] What's the matter?

171
00:09:38,041 --> 00:09:40,000
[HIBARI] I'm just
scared, that's all.

172
00:09:40,083 --> 00:09:43,375
I'm not good at
hand-to-hand combat, Yagyu.

173
00:09:43,458 --> 00:09:44,291
[YAGYU] Hibari.

174
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,750
[HIBARI] Yeah?

175
00:09:46,625 --> 00:09:48,916
You can do it.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,250
Heck yeah!

177
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:52,166
If everybody's changed
and ready, then let's go.

178
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:54,541
Sensei will be
mad if we're late.

179
00:09:54,625 --> 00:10:01,166
[horn]

180
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:02,833
[KIRIYA] All right,
today's first sparring match

181
00:10:02,916 --> 00:10:04,375
will be between...

182
00:10:04,458 --> 00:10:06,500
Katsuragi and Ikaruga!

183
00:10:06,583 --> 00:10:08,083
[BOTH] Yes, sir!

184
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,541
[NARRATOR] The Cabinet's
Special Intelligence Bureau

185
00:10:13,625 --> 00:10:16,083
Section One's top-secret
training center.

186
00:10:16,166 --> 00:10:17,375
That was a mouthful.

187
00:10:17,458 --> 00:10:19,208
Look, it's a
shinobi school, okay?

188
00:10:20,208 --> 00:10:23,041
[NARRATOR] Third year
students, Ikaruga...

189
00:10:26,875 --> 00:10:28,250
Got you!

190
00:10:28,333 --> 00:10:29,875
[NARRATOR]
...and Katsuragi.

191
00:10:32,625 --> 00:10:34,833
[Katsugari grunting]

192
00:10:34,916 --> 00:10:36,375
Yeah! You go, Katsu!

193
00:10:36,458 --> 00:10:38,083
[NARRATOR] Second year, Asuka.

194
00:10:38,166 --> 00:10:40,583
[HIBARI] Now that's
what I'm talkin' about!

195
00:10:40,666 --> 00:10:41,666
That was awesome!

196
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,375
[NARRATOR] First
year students, Hibari.

197
00:10:43,458 --> 00:10:45,666
And the prodigy, Yagyu.

198
00:10:46,791 --> 00:10:48,958
Next up, Asuka versus Yagyu.

199
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,708
Sir!

200
00:10:53,958 --> 00:10:55,708
Here goes nothin'!

201
00:11:00,333 --> 00:11:01,750
[NARRATOR] The only
people on campus who know

202
00:11:01,833 --> 00:11:04,458
about this secret school
are the five top-heavy teens

203
00:11:04,541 --> 00:11:06,583
in training and their sensei.

204
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:08,333
Together, they spend
their days and nights here

205
00:11:08,416 --> 00:11:11,541
working towards their
goal of becoming shinobi.

206
00:11:13,333 --> 00:11:15,166
[KATSURAGI] Still can't
believe I kicked your ass!

207
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,208
[IKARUGA] Only because
I couldn't use my sword.

208
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:19,166
Someone's a sore loser.

209
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:20,875
You just got lucky, okay?

210
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:23,291
[laughing]

211
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,750
Man. I'm gettin'
hungry. What do you guys

212
00:11:27,833 --> 00:11:29,208
wanna do for lunch today?

213
00:11:29,291 --> 00:11:30,750
I don't care as long as
it's not fast food again.

214
00:11:30,833 --> 00:11:32,416
[ASUKA] I've got
it covered, ladies!

215
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,000
I brought you back a little
somethin' from my trip.

216
00:11:35,083 --> 00:11:37,000
Wow, are those
Futomaki rolls?

217
00:11:37,083 --> 00:11:38,208
They look so yummy!

218
00:11:38,291 --> 00:11:39,541
I have to admit,
that's way better than

219
00:11:39,625 --> 00:11:41,125
some silly souvenir.

220
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:46,000
These are delicious. Where
did you get them, Asuka?

221
00:11:46,083 --> 00:11:47,666
I stayed at my folks'
last night and they wouldn't

222
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:49,208
let me leave
without taking some.

223
00:11:49,291 --> 00:11:50,958
Right. How could I forget?

224
00:11:51,041 --> 00:11:52,583
[IKARUGA] Your family
owns a sushi shop.

225
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,208
[ASUKA] The best in town!

226
00:11:54,291 --> 00:11:56,333
What better way to
express my gratitude than

227
00:11:56,416 --> 00:11:58,833
by caressing
your heavenly honkers?

228
00:12:01,833 --> 00:12:04,000
[KIRIYA] Whoa. Are
those futomaki rolls?

229
00:12:04,083 --> 00:12:05,541
Yeah! [coughing]

230
00:12:05,625 --> 00:12:07,416
Would you like one,
Kiriya-sensei?

231
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,875
[KIRIYA] Why yes, thank you.

232
00:12:12,333 --> 00:12:14,791
So tell me, Asuka, how's
Hanzo holding up these days?

233
00:12:14,875 --> 00:12:16,916
[ASUKA] Grandpa?
Oh, he's doing great.

234
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,750
He wanted these rolls
to be perfect so he woke up

235
00:12:18,833 --> 00:12:21,250
at the crack of dawn
this morning to make 'em.

236
00:12:21,333 --> 00:12:23,833
You don't say. It's good
to hear he hasn't changed

237
00:12:23,916 --> 00:12:25,583
even after all this time.

238
00:12:25,666 --> 00:12:27,125
[KIRIYA] Enough
with the small talk.

239
00:12:27,208 --> 00:12:29,333
It's time to take your shinobi
training to the next level.

240
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,291
I'm sending you on your first
mission outside the school.

241
00:12:32,375 --> 00:12:33,750
Are you sure
we're ready for that?

242
00:12:33,833 --> 00:12:35,625
Awesome! This is what
I've been waitin' for!

243
00:12:35,708 --> 00:12:37,083
[NATSURAGI] What good're
all the shinobi skills

244
00:12:37,166 --> 00:12:38,666
we've learned if
we never use 'em?

245
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:41,541
We finally get a chance
to show you what we can do!

246
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:44,000
Alright! Need us
to assassinate someone?

247
00:12:44,083 --> 00:12:46,958
No, you'll be dealing with
punks in the shopping district.

248
00:12:47,041 --> 00:12:48,916
The merchants are losing
business because of the

249
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,666
delinquents who're hanging
around and causing trouble.

250
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,333
So we have
to beat up punks?

251
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,250
I don't like punks.
They're scary.

252
00:12:55,333 --> 00:12:56,625
No need to worry, Hibari,

253
00:12:56,708 --> 00:12:58,000
I'll be right
there to protect you.

254
00:12:58,083 --> 00:12:59,500
[Hibari gasps]

255
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:11,208
[KATSURAGI] Man, this
sucks. I thought we were

256
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:13,125
gonna get a cool
top-secret mission like

257
00:13:13,208 --> 00:13:15,375
escorting a VIP or
infiltrating an embassy

258
00:13:15,458 --> 00:13:17,000
for classified information.

259
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:18,750
Why would anyone
hire a group of students

260
00:13:18,833 --> 00:13:20,625
for an important mission
of state when there are

261
00:13:20,708 --> 00:13:23,208
plenty of qualified shinobi
available to do the job?

262
00:13:23,291 --> 00:13:25,458
[KATSURAGI] If there's so many,
why're we huntin' punks?

263
00:13:25,541 --> 00:13:27,750
How are we supposed to
fight 'em in a public place?

264
00:13:27,833 --> 00:13:30,500
We'll be in big trouble if
anyone finds out we're shinobi.

265
00:13:30,583 --> 00:13:32,541
[ASUKA] This might end up
being harder than we thought.

266
00:13:32,625 --> 00:13:34,166
[IKARUGA] Yes, that's
why it's excellent training.

267
00:13:34,250 --> 00:13:35,416
[KATSURAGI]
Yeah, yeah, whatever.

268
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:37,333
Are we just gonna wander
around 'til we find 'em

269
00:13:37,416 --> 00:13:39,541
or should we come
up with a plan?

270
00:13:40,375 --> 00:13:41,625
Hibari's got a good point.

271
00:13:41,708 --> 00:13:43,750
We're wasting our time
walking around aimlessly.

272
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,541
I think we should split
up and search for our target.

273
00:13:46,625 --> 00:13:57,291
[market chatter]

274
00:13:57,375 --> 00:13:59,791
As far as I can tell,
the temple is punk-free.

275
00:13:59,875 --> 00:14:01,333
[GIRL] 'Scuse me?

276
00:14:01,416 --> 00:14:03,291
[ASUKA] Hey, I know you!

277
00:14:03,375 --> 00:14:05,875
We met on
the water bus earlier.

278
00:14:06,666 --> 00:14:09,000
You're stalkin' me, aren't ya?

279
00:14:09,083 --> 00:14:10,750
[HOMURA] I'm on a
field trip with my school.

280
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:13,000
[ASUKA] Cool! How
do you like Asakusa?

281
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:14,541
It's beautiful but
I'd like it even more

282
00:14:14,625 --> 00:14:17,083
if I could find my friends.
I got separated from 'em

283
00:14:17,166 --> 00:14:19,333
and my stupid school
doesn't allow cell phones.

284
00:14:19,416 --> 00:14:21,500
I don't suppose you remember
where you last saw 'em?

285
00:14:21,583 --> 00:14:24,500
Uh, I think that it was
near one of the main streets.

286
00:14:24,583 --> 00:14:26,000
[HOMURA] This
doesn't look right.

287
00:14:26,083 --> 00:14:27,916
It's gonna be hard to
figure out what street it was

288
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
'cause Asakusa's
got so many of 'em.

289
00:14:30,083 --> 00:14:32,333
Do you have any idea
where they might be headed?

290
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:33,708
I really appreciate
your help but I'm sure

291
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:35,125
you've got better
things to do.

292
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:37,541
Oh, it's not a big deal.
I don't have any plans today.

293
00:14:37,625 --> 00:14:38,750
Are you sure?
'Cause you looked busy

294
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,000
when I ran into you.

295
00:14:40,083 --> 00:14:41,375
Oh, no, I was
just wrapping up

296
00:14:41,458 --> 00:14:42,833
a class assignment, that's all.

297
00:14:42,916 --> 00:14:44,083
You go to school here, right?

298
00:14:44,166 --> 00:14:45,541
I don't wanna get you
in trouble or anything.

299
00:14:45,625 --> 00:14:47,166
Don't you worry,
that's not gonna happen,

300
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:48,833
I've got family
ties to my school.

301
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:51,750
I try not to abuse
it but it sure is handy.

302
00:14:51,833 --> 00:14:55,291
Really? Well,
aren't you a lucky girl?

303
00:14:55,375 --> 00:14:57,333
[HIBARI] Can I
ask you somethin'?

304
00:14:57,416 --> 00:14:59,791
Why'd you come with me when
we were supposed to split up?

305
00:14:59,875 --> 00:15:02,333
Because somebody
needs to protect you.

306
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,708
I'm not a baby, you
know, I can handle those

307
00:15:04,791 --> 00:15:06,125
mean 'ol punks by myself!

308
00:15:06,208 --> 00:15:08,625
You say that but what
if they sneak up on you?

309
00:15:08,708 --> 00:15:10,166
Why would they wanna do that?

310
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,958
I know they're mean and all
but do they have to play dirty?

311
00:15:12,041 --> 00:15:13,041
[GIRL PUNK]
Hold it right there.

312
00:15:13,125 --> 00:15:14,500
Huh?

313
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,875
[Punks laughing]

314
00:15:19,958 --> 00:15:21,500
[PUNK 1] Judgin'
by the uniforms,

315
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,833
these bimbos are
from Hanzo Academy.

316
00:15:23,916 --> 00:15:25,166
[GIRL PUNK] Is that so?

317
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:28,125
One a them hoity-toity
schools, ain't it?

318
00:15:28,208 --> 00:15:29,791
What does it matter to you?

319
00:15:29,875 --> 00:15:32,416
'Cause if you go there,
you gotta have money.

320
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,625
You must be the punks that
we've been looking for.

321
00:15:34,708 --> 00:15:37,250
Hibari! Send
out the signal, now!

322
00:15:37,333 --> 00:15:38,708
[HIBARI] Okay!

323
00:15:41,458 --> 00:15:43,125
[NARRATOR]
A shinobi smoke signal.

324
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:46,791
A warning shot into the sky that
only trained ninja can detect.

325
00:15:46,875 --> 00:15:48,416
Basically, when
you see one of these,

326
00:15:48,500 --> 00:15:50,500
you know shit's
about to go down.

327
00:15:56,875 --> 00:15:58,125
I don't know where
they could've gone;

328
00:15:58,208 --> 00:15:59,208
we've looked everywhere.

329
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,208
I'm sorry for the trouble.

330
00:16:01,291 --> 00:16:03,041
Oh no, I'm sorry
I haven't been able

331
00:16:03,125 --> 00:16:05,583
to help you find
your classmates!

332
00:16:05,666 --> 00:16:07,291
[ASUKA] A signal!

333
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
Is something wrong?

334
00:16:09,083 --> 00:16:10,708
Not at all.
Everything's A-OK!

335
00:16:10,791 --> 00:16:12,125
I just realized
that we forgot to check

336
00:16:12,208 --> 00:16:15,666
at the Benten-sama
shrine! C'mon, let's go!

337
00:16:25,416 --> 00:16:28,125
Did you come here lookin'
for a fight, little girl?

338
00:16:28,208 --> 00:16:30,916
I dunno if we can take
'em on our own, Yagyu.

339
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,541
We don't have to.

340
00:16:42,250 --> 00:16:44,541
Great, more
Hanzo Academy chicks.

341
00:16:44,625 --> 00:16:46,041
[Hibari small outcry]

342
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,958
'Kay, whose face
am I bashin' in first?

343
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:51,458
[PUNK] You startin'
a fight with us?

344
00:16:51,541 --> 00:16:53,333
We've been asked
to rid the shopping district

345
00:16:53,416 --> 00:16:55,916
of punks, like you.
I suppose that you could

346
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,541
just call us the
disciplinary committee.

347
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:01,083
Where's Asuka?
Have you seen her?

348
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,750
We could really use
her help right now.

349
00:17:03,833 --> 00:17:06,000
[sigh] I wish she'd
take this seriously.

350
00:17:06,083 --> 00:17:07,208
Can you handle crowd control?

351
00:17:07,291 --> 00:17:09,291
Sure thing! Leave it to me!

352
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:12,625
If you want a
fight, then we'll give ya one!

353
00:17:12,708 --> 00:17:13,708
[PUNKS] Yeah!

354
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:15,000
I guess we don't
have much of a choice.

355
00:17:15,083 --> 00:17:16,208
Let's do this, Katsu!

356
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,666
Okay!

357
00:17:19,416 --> 00:17:22,250
[ASUKA] Now I'm worried. I
hope the others are all right.

358
00:17:22,333 --> 00:17:23,458
[HOMURA] We've looked
all over the city

359
00:17:23,541 --> 00:17:25,416
and there's no sign of 'em.

360
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,000
They must've left already.

361
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:29,458
[ASUKA] You really think
they'd leave without you?

362
00:17:33,041 --> 00:17:35,666
[Asuka startled]

363
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:39,083
[HIBARI] Sorry for
the inconvenience!

364
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,041
This road is temporarily
closed for construction!

365
00:17:42,125 --> 00:17:44,375
Geez, I wish
they'd hurry it up.

366
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,791
I didn't even break a
sweat against those creeps.

367
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,666
I can't believe
Asuka never showed up.

368
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:51,666
Right? What're we
gonna do with that girl?

369
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:55,291
[Punks moaning]

370
00:17:55,375 --> 00:17:56,750
[GIRL PUNK] Uh...

371
00:17:57,458 --> 00:17:58,875
[KATSURAGI] How're those
scumbags getting back up

372
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:00,666
after we beat
the crap outta them?

373
00:18:00,750 --> 00:18:02,208
Something's not right!

374
00:18:02,291 --> 00:18:04,375
[IKARUGA] I get the feeling
we might be in over our heads.

375
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:06,458
Hey you guys, hold on!

376
00:18:06,541 --> 00:18:07,500
What is it, Hibari?

377
00:18:07,583 --> 00:18:08,958
It sounds crazy,
but I don't think

378
00:18:09,041 --> 00:18:10,125
those punks have souls!

379
00:18:10,208 --> 00:18:11,791
[gasp] What?

380
00:18:12,958 --> 00:18:14,500
[GIRL] She may
not be the brightest.

381
00:18:14,583 --> 00:18:17,416
But her senses
are sharp. [chuckles]

382
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:18,541
I'll do whatever it takes

383
00:18:18,625 --> 00:18:20,666
to get my hands
on that little cutie.

384
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:27,208
No way! You
gotta be kiddin' me!

385
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:36,750
It's a shinobi kekkai!

386
00:18:36,833 --> 00:18:38,250
[NARRATOR] A shinobi kekkai.

387
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:40,291
A barrier that
transcends time and space

388
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:42,083
where ninja can beat
the ever lovin' crap

389
00:18:42,166 --> 00:18:44,541
out of one another
without being seen.

390
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:46,166
I knew I sensed something odd!

391
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:47,291
They're shinobi, too!

392
00:18:47,375 --> 00:18:48,666
I didn't think it
would come to this.

393
00:18:48,750 --> 00:18:50,708
[IKARUGA] But there's only
one thing we can do now.

394
00:18:50,791 --> 00:18:53,083
Yeah, and that's
kick their punk asses!

395
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,625
Sensei's gonna be pissed
but we've got no choice.

396
00:18:55,708 --> 00:18:57,458
[IKARUGA]
Shinobi transformation!

397
00:18:57,541 --> 00:18:59,791
[HIBARI, KATSURAGI, AND YAGYU]
Shinobi transformation!

398
00:19:01,375 --> 00:19:03,208
[NARRATOR] A
shinobi transformation.

399
00:19:03,291 --> 00:19:05,500
A secret technique in
which ninja must release

400
00:19:05,583 --> 00:19:08,291
dormant energy from
all six chakras at once.

401
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:11,041
If successful, they will
instantaneously change into

402
00:19:11,125 --> 00:19:13,375
a uniform matching
their fighting style.

403
00:19:13,458 --> 00:19:15,500
Not only does transforming
give us a quick peek

404
00:19:15,583 --> 00:19:17,333
at the goods, if
you know what I mean,

405
00:19:17,416 --> 00:19:20,750
but it allows them to use their
powers at the maximum level!

406
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,666
[Punks growl]

407
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:26,416
[HOMURA] Are you all right?

408
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,416
Uh. Yeah, I'm okay.

409
00:19:29,458 --> 00:19:31,375
Thanks again for helping me.

410
00:19:31,458 --> 00:19:34,083
[ASUKA] No problem. Uh sorry,
I don't know your name.

411
00:19:34,166 --> 00:19:35,958
Mine's Asuka.

412
00:19:36,041 --> 00:19:37,708
My name's Homura.

413
00:19:37,791 --> 00:19:39,375
That's pretty, I like it!

414
00:19:39,458 --> 00:19:41,583
Well, I'll see
you later, Homura!

415
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,791
[HOMURA] I blatantly
revealed my bloodlust to her

416
00:19:44,875 --> 00:19:47,083
and she never even sensed it.

417
00:19:47,833 --> 00:19:49,208
Don't worry, I'm
sure your friends will

418
00:19:49,291 --> 00:19:52,708
turn up sooner
or later! Bye-bye!

419
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:56,500
Oh, I'm not worried. I
know exactly where they are.

420
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,500
[HARUKA] The time has come
my precious little puppets,

421
00:19:58,583 --> 00:20:00,916
let's show these
girls what you can do.

422
00:20:04,875 --> 00:20:06,333
[Girl Punk grunt] 

423
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:26,708
[IKARUGA] They're wooden
dolls. But how can that be?

424
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,125
[HIBARI] Huh?

425
00:20:31,708 --> 00:20:33,041
[KATSURAGI] We were attacked
by wooden dolls posing as punks.

426
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:34,500
How's that even possible?

427
00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,958
[IKARUGA] I have no idea.

428
00:20:36,041 --> 00:20:38,416
All I know is that
we were their target.

429
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,916
Who would attack us?
We don't have any enemies.

430
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,583
It's kinda hard to
explain but I only sensed

431
00:20:42,666 --> 00:20:44,250
a single presence
from the dolls.

432
00:20:44,333 --> 00:20:45,625
[HIBARI] It's as if one
person was controlling

433
00:20:45,708 --> 00:20:47,458
all four of them.

434
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,291
Are you alright, dear?

435
00:20:50,375 --> 00:20:51,333
I think so.

436
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:52,791
You're just as cute as can be.

437
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:53,791
Thanks?

438
00:20:53,875 --> 00:20:55,833
[Haruka chuckling] See ya!

439
00:20:55,916 --> 00:20:58,500
Wow! She's so
friendly and pretty!

440
00:20:58,583 --> 00:20:59,708
[YAGYU] I don't trust her.

441
00:20:59,791 --> 00:21:00,875
[HIBARI] Well,
I think she's sweet!

442
00:21:00,958 --> 00:21:02,666
[ASUKA] There you are!

443
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
What happened to you?

444
00:21:05,083 --> 00:21:06,625
Yeah, why's
your uniform soaked?

445
00:21:06,708 --> 00:21:08,458
[ASUKA] It's kind
of a long story.

446
00:21:08,541 --> 00:21:10,375
You see, this girl was lost
and couldn't find her class

447
00:21:10,458 --> 00:21:12,583
so I helped her--
Whoa! You look pissed!

448
00:21:12,666 --> 00:21:14,750
I am 'cause we needed
your help more than anyone!

449
00:21:14,833 --> 00:21:17,083
Those punks we were after
turned out to be dolls.

450
00:21:17,166 --> 00:21:18,375
[ASUKA] What do
you mean "dolls"?

451
00:21:18,458 --> 00:21:20,458
We'll update you later.
It can wait until after

452
00:21:20,541 --> 00:21:23,041
you've received your
punishment from Kiriya-sensei.

453
00:21:23,125 --> 00:21:24,625
[ASUKA] My punishment?

454
00:21:24,708 --> 00:21:26,875
[IKARUGA] You'd better be ready
for some hardcore meditation!

455
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,750
[ASUKA] Aw...

456
00:21:31,416 --> 00:21:33,333
[HARUKA] They were quite
lovely. In fact, I'd like to

457
00:21:33,416 --> 00:21:36,708
make all of them
my pretty, little puppets.

458
00:21:36,791 --> 00:21:38,541
[GIRL] I'd like to hear
your thoughts, Homura.

459
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:41,125
Tell us about the legendary
shinobi's granddaughter.

460
00:21:41,208 --> 00:21:43,666
[HOMURA] Let's just say I was
expecting a formidable warrior

461
00:21:43,750 --> 00:21:45,166
and I left disappointed.

462
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:47,291
[GIRL 1] If they're so
