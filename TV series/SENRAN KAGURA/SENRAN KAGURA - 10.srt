only way the shinobi students

Bringing them together, and

00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:35,458
Are you coming?

313
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:36,458
[HIBARI] Yeah!

314
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:39,958
[Hibari gasps]

315
00:14:40,041 --> 00:14:42,791
My, you're such a clumsy
little girl, aren't you?

316
00:14:42,875 --> 00:14:43,583
[gasps]

317
00:14:43,666 --> 00:14:45,000
I'm so sorry, Haruka!

318
00:14:45,083 --> 00:14:49,041
Don't apologize. It
just makes you cuter.

319
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:50,500
Thank you.

320
00:15:00,541 --> 00:15:02,291
[ASUKA] I won't
need this anymore.

321
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,291
Are you ready
to go now, Asuka?

322
00:15:07,416 --> 00:15:08,916
Sure thing.

323
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:12,000
[KATSURAGI] So that's Hebijo
Clandestine Girls' Academy, huh?

324
00:15:12,083 --> 00:15:14,583
[YAGYU] Hibari's being held
somewhere inside those walls.

325
00:15:14,666 --> 00:15:16,750
[IKARUGA] Let's wait here
until the sun goes down.

326
00:15:20,791 --> 00:15:22,041
[MIRAI sighs]

327
00:15:22,125 --> 00:15:23,750
There's nothing
better than a hot bath

328
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:25,583
after a hard day of training!

329
00:15:25,666 --> 00:15:27,791
[HIBARI] I've gotta try
to get the secret scroll back

330
00:15:27,875 --> 00:15:29,333
before the others make it here.

331
00:15:29,416 --> 00:15:31,583
[HIKAGE] What's wrong?
Do we make you nervous?

332
00:15:31,666 --> 00:15:33,375
[gasps]

333
00:15:33,958 --> 00:15:37,500
[HIBARI] So, um, do you mind
if I ask you guys something?

334
00:15:37,583 --> 00:15:39,291
If it has to do with
sprouts, you're in luck,

335
00:15:39,375 --> 00:15:40,458
because I'm an expert!

336
00:15:40,541 --> 00:15:42,458
No. It's not
about sprouts.

337
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:44,833
Well, then I don't
know if I can help.

338
00:15:44,916 --> 00:15:46,000
I was wondering
if you could tell me

339
00:15:46,083 --> 00:15:49,083
more about
Suzune-sensei, please?

340
00:15:49,166 --> 00:15:50,666
She's a really
good teacher.

341
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,291
She can be awfully
strict sometimes,

342
00:15:52,375 --> 00:15:55,125
but you can tell that she has
faith in us and our abilities.

343
00:15:55,208 --> 00:15:56,833
Unfortunately, she
doesn't share my interest

344
00:15:56,916 --> 00:15:58,916
in sprouts even
though she raised me.

345
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,375
I wouldn't be the
elegant young lady

346
00:16:00,458 --> 00:16:03,166
you see before you if it
wasn't for Suzune-sensei.

347
00:16:03,250 --> 00:16:06,416
[MAN] Seize the
traitor Suzune at once!

348
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:08,541
[HOMURA] You okay
there, space cadet?

349
00:16:08,625 --> 00:16:09,833
You aren't startin'
to miss your teacher back

350
00:16:09,916 --> 00:16:11,541
at Hanzo Academy, are ya?

351
00:16:11,625 --> 00:16:14,000
[YOMI] You know you're free
to go back to them if you want.

352
00:16:14,083 --> 00:16:15,875
[HIBARI] Um. No, that's not it!

353
00:16:15,958 --> 00:16:17,333
[HARUKA] That's enough, ladies.

354
00:16:17,416 --> 00:16:20,625
Let's stop picking on my
poor, little Hibari, okay?

355
00:16:20,708 --> 00:16:24,833
She's new, so we should be
extra nice to her. Like this.

356
00:16:24,916 --> 00:16:27,958
I, uh. No
Haruka. Please.

357
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:30,958
You like it. Don't you?

358
00:16:33,375 --> 00:16:35,166
If you ask me, it looks
like you're the one

359
00:16:35,250 --> 00:16:36,750
who's picking on her, Haruka.

360
00:16:36,833 --> 00:16:38,416
[HARUKA] I'm doing
nothing of the sort.

361
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,958
I'm just showing her some love!

362
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:41,208
Call it what you
will, but I think

363
00:16:41,291 --> 00:16:43,041
your behavior is
rather indecent.

364
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:45,041
Goodness, your face is
turning bright red, Mirai.

365
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:46,250
Are you blushing?

366
00:16:46,333 --> 00:16:47,875
No, if I'm red it's
'cause the bath's hot!

367
00:16:47,958 --> 00:16:49,958
Don't start messin'
with me, Yomi!

368
00:16:50,041 --> 00:16:53,208
[giggles]

369
00:16:53,291 --> 00:16:55,916
[laughs]

370
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,541
What a buncha boneheads.

371
00:16:58,625 --> 00:17:00,625
[laughs]

372
00:17:00,708 --> 00:17:03,833
[HIBARI] The more time I spend
with Haruka and the other girls.

373
00:17:03,916 --> 00:17:07,833
The more I realize that deep
down they're not bad people.

374
00:17:07,916 --> 00:17:09,333
[HARUKA] She had
no other choice but to

375
00:17:09,416 --> 00:17:11,500
become an evil ninja after that.

376
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:12,666
[YOMI] You're so cute...

377
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:15,375
[MIRAI] I am not!
You're a big, fat liar!

378
00:17:15,458 --> 00:17:17,583
Cut it out! I'm serious!

379
00:17:21,333 --> 00:17:23,416
[HIBARI] I just know they're
keeping the secret scroll

380
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:26,291
in that room. I have
to get it back somehow.

381
00:17:29,083 --> 00:17:30,375
[HOMURA] You summoned us, sir?

382
00:17:30,458 --> 00:17:33,250
If you don't mind me
asking, what is this about?

383
00:17:37,291 --> 00:17:39,666
[NARRATOR] A Seclusion
drape. It refracts light

384
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:43,291
in such a way that its user
blends in with the background.

385
00:17:43,375 --> 00:17:45,791
It makes a great gift for
the peeping tom in your life.

386
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:48,666
[HIBARI] I'll hide here,
until everyone leaves.

387
00:17:51,125 --> 00:17:53,125
[HOMURA] Suzune-sensei
betrayed us?

388
00:17:53,208 --> 00:17:54,958
[YOMI] But how?
I don't understand.

389
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:56,458
[MAN] She leaked
Hebijo's location

390
00:17:56,541 --> 00:17:58,458
to the Hanzo Academy shinobi.

391
00:17:58,541 --> 00:18:01,416
[MIRAI] For real? But why
would Sensei do such a thing?

392
00:18:01,500 --> 00:18:05,375
[HARUKA] My, my. Could she
be following in my footsteps?

393
00:18:05,458 --> 00:18:08,291
[MAN] She blindsided me.
I knew Suzune had trained

394
00:18:08,375 --> 00:18:12,208
at Hanzo Academy but I never
doubted her loyalty until now.

395
00:18:12,291 --> 00:18:13,625
[MIRAI] Ha, I knew it!

396
00:18:13,708 --> 00:18:16,750
You mean all the rumors
we heard about her were true?

397
00:18:16,833 --> 00:18:20,875
Our sensei...
[thinks] was a good ninja.

398
00:18:20,958 --> 00:18:23,416
[MAN] Now that the Hanzo
shinobi know where to find us.

399
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,083
It won't be long before
they launch a surprise attack.

400
00:18:26,166 --> 00:18:27,791
When they arrive,
I want you to

401
00:18:27,875 --> 00:18:29,875
intercept them
and wipe them out!

402
00:18:29,958 --> 00:18:31,166
Do I make myself clear?

403
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:32,500
[ALL] Yes, sir!

404
00:18:32,583 --> 00:18:34,708
It's imperative that
you win this battle, ladies.

405
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:37,833
Not just for the academy but
for the fate of all evil ninja!

406
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,250
Failure will not be tolerated!

407
00:18:39,333 --> 00:18:40,250
Never!

408
00:18:40,333 --> 00:18:41,083
[sneers]

409
00:18:41,166 --> 00:18:42,625
That's the spirit, Homura.

410
00:18:42,708 --> 00:18:45,750
Such is the earnest
desire of a shinobi.

411
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,625
But I don't want
to take any chances.

412
00:18:48,708 --> 00:18:49,791
Therefore, I will be invoking

413
00:18:49,875 --> 00:18:51,750
the yoke technique immediately.

414
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:53,000
[NARRATOR] The yoke technique.

415
00:18:53,083 --> 00:18:54,791
An outlawed technique
that gives the caster

416
00:18:54,875 --> 00:18:57,125
control over the
shinobi's life or death.

417
00:18:57,208 --> 00:19:00,083
Basically, if you don't defeat
the enemy it's game over.

418
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,000
As loyal students of
Hebijo Academy, I trust that

419
00:19:03,083 --> 00:19:05,125
none of you will have a
problem with my decision.

420
00:19:05,208 --> 00:19:07,416
If that's not the case,
then please speak up.

421
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:08,500
It's no big deal.

422
00:19:08,583 --> 00:19:10,125
We knew it would
happen sooner or later.

423
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:12,125
Yeah. If that's what
you've gotta do.

424
00:19:12,208 --> 00:19:14,916
I'm not worried 'cause I
know we're gonna squash 'em!

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,083
They're finished.

426
00:19:16,166 --> 00:19:17,916
The yoke technique
simply adds an element

427
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,333
of excitement to our mission.

428
00:19:19,416 --> 00:19:21,208
Though I doubt
we're in any real danger,

429
00:19:21,291 --> 00:19:22,791
there's nothing
more exhilarating

430
00:19:22,875 --> 00:19:24,833
than putting
your life on the line.

431
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,083
[HIBARI] I have to tell
the others about this!

432
00:19:32,750 --> 00:19:34,208
Oh my, would you
care to tell me

433
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,541
what you're doing
out here, cutie?

434
00:19:35,625 --> 00:19:38,208
[HIBARI] Um. Well, I was
heading back to my room

435
00:19:38,291 --> 00:19:40,208
but I got lost somewhere
along the way.

436
00:19:40,291 --> 00:19:42,333
[HARUKA] Really? Poor thing.

437
00:19:42,416 --> 00:19:44,291
Your sense of
direction's that bad?

438
00:19:44,375 --> 00:19:45,916
I can't believe you
were so lost you wandered

439
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,500
all the way to
the top floor.

440
00:19:47,583 --> 00:19:48,791
[nervous laugh]

441
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:50,375
[HIBARI] Sorry, I'm
directionally challenged!

442
00:19:50,458 --> 00:19:52,416
Yeah. I'd say so!

443
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,416
You heard everything
that was said, didn't you?

444
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:55,875
Ah...

445
00:19:55,958 --> 00:19:58,375
[HIBARI] Hey! What do you
think you're doing, Haruka?

446
00:19:58,458 --> 00:20:00,458
I'm sorry about this,
my dear, but we simply

447
00:20:00,541 --> 00:20:02,583
can't afford to have you
interfering with our plans.

448
00:20:02,666 --> 00:20:03,750
[MIRAI] I thought
you were cool.

449
00:20:03,833 --> 00:20:05,333
Silly me, I should've
known the enemy

450
00:20:05,416 --> 00:20:06,791
sent you here to spy on us.

451
00:20:06,875 --> 00:20:08,125
What a naughty girl!

452
00:20:08,208 --> 00:20:10,333
Maybe she'll learn her
lesson if we torture her.

453
00:20:10,416 --> 00:20:11,916
We let our
guard down for you.

454
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,333
[HOMURA] Turns out,
you're nothin' but a traitor.

455
00:20:13,416 --> 00:20:15,333
Homura. Please.

456
00:20:17,375 --> 00:20:18,208
[PATROL NINJA] Let's go!

457
00:20:18,291 --> 00:20:19,125
[hysteria]

458
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,125
[PATROL NINJA 1]
What happened?

459
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:24,291
[PATROL NINJA 2]
They're over here! Hurry!

460
00:20:24,375 --> 00:20:25,875
[KATSURAGI] This
is gonna be tough.

461
00:20:25,958 --> 00:20:28,125
How're we supposed to get inside
when we can't find the entrance?

462
00:20:28,208 --> 00:20:29,041
Well, if we
can't find it

463
00:20:29,125 --> 00:20:30,083
then hopefully
the others will.

464

[YAGYU] It looks as though
this bridge will take us

00:20:34,583 --> 00:20:35,583
to the rear of the castle.

467

Are you gonna die if you lose?

Yes, dear,

You can't be serious!

478
00:20:57,791 --> 00:21:00,541
As a heart attack.
Originally, the technique was

479
00:21:00,625 --> 00:21:02,916
only invoked whenever a student
dropped out or attempted

480

the existence of the school.

[MAN] Building this academy

it was expensive as well.
