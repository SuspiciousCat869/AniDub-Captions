1
00:00:12,916 --> 00:00:14,708
Come on! Give up already!

2
00:00:14,791 --> 00:00:16,166
Don't listen to her!

3
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:17,750
[KATSURAGI] Well, well, well.

4
00:00:17,833 --> 00:00:21,458
The always level-headed Yagyu's
face is turning red as a rose!

5
00:00:21,541 --> 00:00:24,166
Go on! Make your move, kid!

6
00:00:25,958 --> 00:00:26,833
I call!

7
00:00:26,916 --> 00:00:27,750
Ha! I fooled ya!

8
00:00:27,833 --> 00:00:29,291
[YAGYU] No way!

9
00:00:33,416 --> 00:00:34,500
Yeah!

10
00:00:34,583 --> 00:00:36,958
You bought that hook,
line, and sinker!

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,208
[ASUKA] All right! We won!

12
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,250
Aw, this stinks!

13
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,416
I can't believe
they beat us so bad!

14
00:00:44,125 --> 00:00:45,708
[Katsuragi laughing]

15
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,625
Now it's time for the
victor to have her spoils.

16
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:52,458
And my forehead
flicks hurt bad!

17
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:54,583
[YAGYU] Wait!
I'm the one who lost.

18
00:00:54,666 --> 00:00:55,625
Do it to me!

19
00:00:55,708 --> 00:00:57,541
Well, this was a
team effort, right?

20
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,750
And since your whole team
lost that means you've all got

21
00:00:59,833 --> 00:01:01,541
a forehead head flick
coming your way!

22
00:01:01,625 --> 00:01:02,916
That is so unfair.

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,250
I don't make the rules,
I just follow them.

24
00:01:05,333 --> 00:01:07,000
Here we go!

25
00:01:07,916 --> 00:01:09,291
Please no!

26
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:11,458
Forgive me, Hibari.

27
00:01:13,458 --> 00:01:14,916
[HIBARI] Ahhh!

28
00:01:17,875 --> 00:01:18,750
[KATSURAGI] Alrighty.

29
00:01:18,833 --> 00:01:20,583
You're up next!

30
00:01:23,958 --> 00:01:26,666
Ugh, my
forehead's throbbing! Ow!

31
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:28,708
Katsu! You really hurt me!

32
00:01:28,791 --> 00:01:30,333
Please. Don't complain.

33
00:01:30,416 --> 00:01:31,958
I took it easy
on the two of you!

34
00:01:32,041 --> 00:01:33,916
[YAGYU] This is all your fault.

35
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,416
You're the reason
I got this card.

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:39,458
Tits for brains!

37
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,541
What?

38
00:01:40,625 --> 00:01:42,625
Hey! Do not bring
my jugs into this!

39
00:01:42,708 --> 00:01:43,708
Fine then.

40
00:01:43,791 --> 00:01:45,333
How about I bring
my fists into it?

41
00:01:45,416 --> 00:01:48,375
[IKARUGA] Keep it down,
please? I'm trying to read.

42
00:01:53,083 --> 00:01:54,833
[HIBARI] Oh, sorry about that.

43
00:01:54,916 --> 00:01:57,666
You know, the salty air
sure does smell awesome!

44
00:01:57,750 --> 00:01:59,458
Is it the salt in
the breeze or is it maybe

45
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,041
just your spectacular
smelling armpits?

46
00:02:02,625 --> 00:02:04,291
Why are you
sniffing me like that?

47
00:02:04,375 --> 00:02:06,208
I mean, seriously,
this is creepin' me out!

48
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,583
I'm just trying
to get a whiff of

49
00:02:07,666 --> 00:02:09,291
your intoxicating
scent, that's all.

50
00:02:09,375 --> 00:02:11,583
It's spicy, and jam-packed
full of pheromones!

51
00:02:11,666 --> 00:02:13,500
[HIBARI] Oh,
I wanna smell, too!

52
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,708
Stop guys!
Quit messin' with me!

53
00:02:16,791 --> 00:02:18,000
Hey, cut it out!

54
00:02:18,083 --> 00:02:20,083
I already told
you guys to be quiet!

55
00:02:20,166 --> 00:02:22,083
[KATSURAGI] Wow, look at that!

56
00:02:30,916 --> 00:02:31,916
I guess that's it.

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,958
[KIRIYA] Yep.

58
00:02:33,041 --> 00:02:35,541
Welcome to
Shinobi Island, girls.

59
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:51,208
♪

60
00:04:20,333 --> 00:04:22,625
[ASUKA] Wow, so this is
where we're gonna be staying?

61
00:04:22,708 --> 00:04:23,500
[KIRIYA] Yes.

62
00:04:23,583 --> 00:04:24,791
It's quite an ancient building.

63
00:04:24,875 --> 00:04:27,416
And a true historical landmark.

64
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:30,166
[KATSURAGI] One might say
it's past its service life.

65
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:33,083
[IKARUGA] To say it's "dated"
would be an understatement.

66
00:04:33,166 --> 00:04:34,875
[KATSURAGI] Yeah,
this place is hella old.

67
00:04:34,958 --> 00:04:36,291
[IKARUGA] But I guess
that's why we're here;

68
00:04:36,375 --> 00:04:38,250
to learn the
ways of old, right?

69
00:04:38,333 --> 00:04:40,291
[HIBARI] It looks
like a haunted house.

70
00:04:40,375 --> 00:04:43,416
Why would you say that?
You shouldn't joke around.

71
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,916
It might scare the others.

72
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,125
You think so?

73
00:04:46,208 --> 00:04:47,958
[KIRIYA] Haunted or not,
it's a ninja house.

74
00:04:48,041 --> 00:04:50,208
A place where famous
shinobi have come to train

75
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,958
since the Edo period.

76
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:53,791
Training here is an
honor in which you should

77
00:04:53,875 --> 00:04:55,625
take a great deal of pride.

78
00:04:55,708 --> 00:04:57,625
Sorry if we
were disrespectful.

79
00:04:57,708 --> 00:04:59,875
It's just different
from how we imagined it.

80
00:04:59,958 --> 00:05:00,875
That's all.

81
00:05:00,958 --> 00:05:01,625
[HIBARI] Maybe
we'll see a ghost.

82
00:05:01,708 --> 00:05:03,083
You should stop.

83
00:05:04,458 --> 00:05:06,458
[KIRIYA] All right, ladies.
It's time to get to work.

84
00:05:06,541 --> 00:05:08,541
[ASUKA] Wait.
You mean like right now?

85
00:05:08,625 --> 00:05:10,083
[KATSURAGI] But we
just got here, Sensei!

86
00:05:10,166 --> 00:05:11,666
C'mon, give us a break!

87
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:13,500
Can't we at least
go swimming first?

88
00:05:13,583 --> 00:05:14,708
No, you cannot.

89
00:05:14,791 --> 00:05:17,541
Not until you complete
your first task!

90
00:05:21,041 --> 00:05:22,708
[KIRIYA] Clean up this place!

91
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,958
[IKARUGA] He's right.

92
00:05:35,041 --> 00:05:36,125
We have to get this mess
sorted out or it won't be

93
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:38,291
in any condition
for us to stay here.

94
00:05:38,375 --> 00:05:40,416
But to actually get
this place in good shape,

95
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,416
we'll have to clean
for the rest of the day.

96
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:43,916
[KATSURAGI] This really sucks.

97
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,041
Here we are with
a great beach right outside,

98
00:05:46,125 --> 00:05:48,500
and we're stuck
inside this friggin' hole.

99
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:51,875
Huh?

100
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,916
What the heck?

101
00:05:56,958 --> 00:05:57,916
[KATSURAGI] No wait!

102
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,083
You've got the
wrong idea, Sensei!

103
00:05:59,166 --> 00:06:00,041
It's not like that!

104
00:06:00,125 --> 00:06:01,125
I wasn't slacking off!

105
00:06:01,208 --> 00:06:02,833
[HIBARI] Sorry, Katsu!

106
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:03,708
[KATSURAGI] Geez!

107
00:06:03,791 --> 00:06:04,958
Don't freak me out like that!

108
00:06:05,041 --> 00:06:07,250
I thought I was in big
trouble, rafter monkey!

109
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,500
Hey. Where did Sensei go?

110
00:06:09,583 --> 00:06:11,708
[IKARUGA] He took off
with Yagyu earlier today.

111
00:06:11,791 --> 00:06:13,083
Something about fishing.

112
00:06:13,166 --> 00:06:14,500
[KATSURAGI] What?

113
00:06:14,583 --> 00:06:16,583
They're out having fun
while we do all the hard labor?

114
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,041
Why'd he take her along?

115
00:06:18,125 --> 00:06:20,958
He wanted to make sure they
actually caught something?

116
00:06:40,041 --> 00:06:41,250
[KIRIYA] Got one.

117
00:06:46,625 --> 00:06:47,958
[KIRIYA] Damn.

118
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:07,416
[KIRIYA] Oh yeah.
This is bad.

119
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:11,166
[KIRIYA] At this rate, I'll
be discredited as a teacher.

120
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:13,666
[ASUKA] Does this mean
that dinner tonight--

121
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:15,666
[KATSURAGI] Is gonna
be whatever they catch?

122
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,041
[IKARUGA] I guess this
is part of our training, too.

123
00:07:18,125 --> 00:07:19,416
I think we'll be okay.

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,041
It looks like we've
got enough salt, rice,

125
00:07:21,125 --> 00:07:22,541
and miso to make something.

126
00:07:22,625 --> 00:07:23,500
Wait a second.

127
00:07:23,583 --> 00:07:25,583
Is that really all we have?

128
00:07:28,333 --> 00:07:31,333
The note says, "Hang in
there. Super-ninja or bust."

129
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:33,208
What's that supposed to mean?

130
00:07:44,083 --> 00:07:47,083
Well, this should take care
of the firewood problem.

131
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,291
Aw man, I can't
wait to go swimming.

132
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,625
Swim suits.

133
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:56,625
[all giggling]

134
00:07:56,708 --> 00:07:59,541
[laughing]

135
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:08,208
These bowls were covered
in a layer of dust,

136
00:08:08,291 --> 00:08:10,666
but it's nothing a good
wipe down can't fix!

137
00:08:11,458 --> 00:08:12,208
[HIBARI] Oh cool.

138
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,666
Where'd you get those leeks?

139
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:15,833
I found them growing
wild behind the house.

140
00:08:15,916 --> 00:08:17,541
I think they're
just about to go bad,

141
00:08:17,625 --> 00:08:19,333
but beggars can't
be choosers, right?

142
00:08:19,416 --> 00:08:20,666
That's true.

143
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,250
So can I ask you something?

144
00:08:25,166 --> 00:08:26,500
[ASUKA] Super-ninja?

145
00:08:26,583 --> 00:08:28,708
Yeah. I'm pretty sure
that's what it says.

146
00:08:28,791 --> 00:08:31,000
I'm guessing someone from
one of the previous classes

147
00:08:31,083 --> 00:08:32,458
must have written it up there.

148
00:08:32,541 --> 00:08:34,500
[HIBARI] But why carve it
where no one can see?

149
00:08:34,583 --> 00:08:36,916
[ASUKA] They were probably
trying to be funny or somethin'.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,916
Or maybe it was
supposed to be a secret.

151
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,583
You know, like they
wanted to write a message

152
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:42,125
where nobody would find it.

153
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:43,250
I've done that before.

154
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:44,291
That sounds cool!

155
00:08:44,375 --> 00:08:45,833
Or maybe it was a wish.

156
00:08:45,916 --> 00:08:47,750
And maybe the person
who wrote it turned out to be

157
00:08:47,833 --> 00:08:49,083
a famous shinobi!

158
00:08:49,166 --> 00:08:51,083
It'd be pretty
neat if they did.

159
00:08:53,125 --> 00:08:55,416
[KIRIYA] I've got
plenty for everyone!

160
00:08:56,125 --> 00:08:57,833
[HIBARI] Whoa!

Anyway, as fun as this was,
I think I'll cut my losses

320
00:18:36,916 --> 00:18:38,583
and call it a day.

321
00:18:39,166 --> 00:18:41,416
Don't forget.
No one bests me twice.

322
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,416
Next time you're going down.

323
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:44,875
[MIRAI] I swear!

324
00:18:46,750 --> 00:18:49,166
We'll be seeing
each other soon!

325
00:18:54,541 --> 00:18:57,250
[HIBARI] That shinobi. Why
do you think she attacked us?

326
00:18:57,333 --> 00:18:59,041
I have no idea.

327
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:01,500
[YAGYU] But she's a lot
more skilled than she looks.

328
00:19:06,791 --> 00:19:08,291
Ugh.

329
00:19:08,375 --> 00:19:10,625
You're even
weaker than I thought.

330
00:19:10,708 --> 00:19:13,500
Oh well. I guess
that's enough for today.

331
00:19:14,041 --> 00:19:15,833
I'm not through with you!

332
00:19:17,375 --> 00:19:20,708
[KATSURAGI] Ahhh!

333
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,166
Huh?

334
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:24,833
What the--?

335
00:19:26,041 --> 00:19:27,375
[KATSURAGI] Where
the hell'd you go?

336
00:19:27,458 --> 00:19:29,750
This fight ain't over,
ya' scaly skank!

337
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,208
They should've
been back by now.

338
00:19:35,291 --> 00:19:37,208
I know, I'm starting
to get freaked out.

339
00:19:37,291 --> 00:19:39,125
What if something
bad happened to them?

340
00:19:39,208 --> 00:19:41,125
[ASUKA] Hey!
There they are!

341
00:19:46,875 --> 00:19:49,041
[KIRIYA] We fell
for their plan.

342
00:19:54,166 --> 00:19:56,166
[KIRIYA] Hebijo Girls' Academy.

343
00:19:56,250 --> 00:19:57,791
You're certain
that's what she said?

344
00:19:57,875 --> 00:19:59,000
[HIBARI] Positive.

345
00:19:59,083 --> 00:20:00,375
[IKARUGA] Have you
heard of it before?

346
00:20:00,458 --> 00:20:02,041
[KIRIYA] Master Hanzo
happened to mention it to me

347
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,375
just the other day.

348
00:20:03,458 --> 00:20:05,666
It's a Clandestine Facility.

349
00:20:05,750 --> 00:20:09,125
Apparently, they specialize
in training evil ninja there.

350
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:11,291
To oppose Hanzo Academy.

351
00:20:11,375 --> 00:20:12,208
No way!

352
00:20:12,291 --> 00:20:13,875
Whoa, you can't be serious.

353
00:20:13,958 --> 00:20:15,458
[KIRIYA] I had
planned on filling you in

354
00:20:15,541 --> 00:20:17,416
during your time here.

355
00:20:17,500 --> 00:20:18,583
It makes sense.

356
00:20:18,666 --> 00:20:21,041
That explains why
that lady attacked me.

357
00:20:24,833 --> 00:20:27,875
And the puppet master in
the shopping district, too.

358
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,250
I have no doubt that Hebijo
is behind all of it.

359
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,083
[KATSURAGI] Funny thing
is, the girl I fought,

360
00:20:36,166 --> 00:20:38,041
it seemed like she
was just testing me,

361
00:20:38,125 --> 00:20:40,083
like she wanted
to see what I was made of.

362
00:20:40,166 --> 00:20:42,708
She had me wrapped
around her little finger!

363
00:20:43,041 --> 00:20:44,541
How did I fall for that?

364
00:20:44,625 --> 00:20:46,583
[KATSURAGI] Next time I
see that skank, it's on!

365
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,208
[YAGYU] I got the same
impression from the shinobi

366
00:20:48,291 --> 00:20:49,291
who attacked us.

367
00:20:49,375 --> 00:20:50,625
So you too?

368
00:20:50,708 --> 00:20:53,291
But I didn't sense very
much blood lust from her.

369
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,041
[HIBARI] Then what
were they up to?

370
00:20:55,125 --> 00:20:57,375
In any case, they wouldn't
go to all this trouble

371
00:20:57,458 --> 00:21:00,500
[KIRIYA] just to pick a
fight with Hanzo Academy.

372
00:21:00,583 --> 00:21:02,916
It really doesn't matter
what their objective is.

373
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,250
Just know that good ninjas

374
00:21:04,333 --> 00:21:06,541
must never yield to
evil ninjas, understood?

375
00:21:06,625 --> 00:21:07,916
[ALL] Yes, sir!

376
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,166
I don't care who
they are, there's no way

377
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:11,583
I'm gonna let 'em beat me!

378
00:21:11,666 --> 00:21:12,666
Damn straight!

379
00:21:12,750 --> 00:21:14,583
Next time those
Hebijo broads show up,

380
00:21:14,666 --> 00:21:16,750
I'm gonna put the
squeeze on 'em! Like this!

381
00:21:16,833 --> 00:21:19,208
[Katsuragi laughing]

382
00:21:19,291 --> 00:21:20,291
Oh boy.

383
00:21:20,375 --> 00:21:21,916
Why does it always
come back to that?

384
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:22,916
Yay! Fun!

385
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,541
I guess Katsu
is feeling better!

386
00:21:24,625 --> 00:21:27,041
C'mon, don't encourage her!

387
00:21:27,125 --> 00:21:29,416
Hey Yagyu, I think it's
almost time for dinner.

388
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,125
[IKARUGA] And all
they think about is food.

389
00:21:31,208 --> 00:21:33,458
I really wish everyone
would take this seriously.

390
00:21:33,541 --> 00:21:36,500
First we'll eat broiled squid,
then some squid sashimi,

391
00:21:36,583 --> 00:21:37,791
and then fried squid.

392
00:21:37,875 --> 00:21:39,375
Wait, all we have is squid?

393
00:21:39,458 --> 00:21:41,916
[YAGYU] If you have a problem
with it, you don't have to eat.

394
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,708
[KIRIYA] I don't understand.

395
00:21:47,791 --> 00:21:50,750
How could the enemy
possibly know about Rin?

396
00:21:50,833 --> 00:22:01,250
♪

397
00:22:02,791 --> 00:22:12,750
♪

398
00:23:32,708 --> 00:23:34,666
[ASUKA] You sure like squid
a lot, dontcha' Yagyu?

399
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:36,375
[YAGYU] Yeah, but I like
other things, too, you know.

400
00:23:36,458 --> 00:23:37,375
[ASUKA] Oh really?

401
00:23:37,458 --> 00:23:38,625
Okay then, what
else do you like?

402
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:40,083
[YAGYU] Hibari.

403
00:23:40,166 --> 00:23:41,583
[ASUKA] You put Hibari in
the same category as squid?

404
00:23:41,666 --> 00:23:44,125
[YAGYU] Next time, "Sneak
Attack! Hanzo Academy"!

405
00:23:44,208 --> 00:23:46,916
[ASUKA] Come and get it
like your life depends on it!
