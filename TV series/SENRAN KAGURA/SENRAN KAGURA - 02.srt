[KIRIYA] Hm.

00:00:53,458 --> 00:00:56,166
[NARRATOR] Kugutsu, aside from
referring to freaky puppets

17
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,500
or marionettes,
is also the name of a

18
00:00:58,583 --> 00:01:01,000
shinobi technique
used to manipulate them.

19
00:01:01,083 --> 00:01:03,333
It is incredibly effective
at tricking an opponent,

20
00:01:03,416 --> 00:01:05,541
and doubles as a
bitchin' party trick.

[KIRIYA] Considering everything
you've told me thus far,

00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:09,583
I'd say the shinobi
that attacked you

23
00:01:09,666 --> 00:01:11,750
is more than likely
a Kugutsu Master.

I mean, they must
have an objective.

What do you think it could be?

32

[KIRIYA] I can't say
for sure. Just be cautious.

[KIRIYA] Sure. What is it?

which one is right for me?

your "characteristics,"
so to speak.

[IKARUGA] There's no
need to rush yourself.

128
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,416
It'll only frustrate
you. Take your time.

129
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,666
It just sucks 'cause
when I ask myself

130
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:01,666
which creature I wanna
summon, my mind starts

131

flipping through
all the ones I like

132
00:08:03,375 --> 00:08:04,750
and then I get overwhelmed.

133
00:08:04,833 --> 00:08:06,625
So, tell me. How'd
you finally decide on

134

that giant fried
chicken thingy?

135
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,208
Do you just really
like fried foods or--

136
00:08:10,291 --> 00:08:11,583
It's called a Phoenix.

137
00:08:11,666 --> 00:08:13,416
That's what I meant.

138

Yes. I think
that's how everyone

141
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:20,541
finds their creature. You
just have to be patient

142
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,333
and let it come to
you when it's ready.

Thank you. I'll try not to
let this summoning business

get me down anymore.

What should I do?

[HANZO] Take a close look
at these swords, Asuka.

00:15:45,208 --> 00:15:47,500
of shinobi practicing
their arts together.

312
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:48,875
Well, that makes sense.

313
00:15:48,958 --> 00:15:50,958
So what is our family's
summoning creature, Grandpa?

314
00:15:51,041 --> 00:15:52,041
[HANZO] Nothing too exciting.

315
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:53,791
It's rather
traditional for shinobi.

316
00:15:53,875 --> 00:15:55,291
Traditional like how?

317
00:15:55,375 --> 00:15:57,166
Please don't leave me
in suspense, for real.

318
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:58,666
I'm dying to know!

319
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,416
[HANZO] Very well then.

320
00:16:01,791 --> 00:16:04,166
[ASUKA] What? We
summon freakin' frogs?

321
00:16:04,250 --> 00:16:05,458
No, that can't be true.

322
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:07,291
You're just teasing me.

323
00:16:07,375 --> 00:16:09,208
I suppose I have no
one but myself to blame

324
00:16:09,291 --> 00:16:10,750
for not making sure
you were comfortable

325
00:16:10,833 --> 00:16:12,291
with them as a child.

326
00:16:12,375 --> 00:16:14,166
It's a cruel twist of fate that
the heir to our family line

327
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:16,541
would possess such
paralyzing fear of frogs.

328
00:16:16,625 --> 00:16:18,875
[HANZO] You must learn
to overcome it, Asuka!

329
00:16:18,958 --> 00:16:19,875
[Asuka sigh]

330
00:16:19,958 --> 00:16:22,375
I'll do my best, Grandpa.

331
00:16:23,125 --> 00:16:25,500
Oh. By the way,
where can I find Kiri--

332
00:16:25,583 --> 00:16:26,750
[BOTH] Ahhh!

333
00:16:26,833 --> 00:16:28,166
[KIRIYA] Nice to see
you again, Master Hanzo.

334
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,625
It's been far too long.

335
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:30,625
[Hanzo coughing]

336
00:16:30,708 --> 00:16:32,625
I see you
haven't changed a bit.

337
00:16:37,041 --> 00:16:38,958
[KATSURAGI] How hard can
it be to find one frog?

338
00:16:39,041 --> 00:16:40,166
We'd probably have better luck

339
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:41,666
if we searched near the pond.

340
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:43,583
[HIBARI]
Come on out, Mr. Frog!

341
00:16:43,666 --> 00:16:45,250
Thanks you guys, but
you're wasting your time

342
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,833
looking for frogs. I need
to handle this myself.

343
00:16:47,916 --> 00:16:49,125
[YAGYU] You won't
able to summon one

344
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:50,500
until you've
conquered your fear

345
00:16:50,583 --> 00:16:52,000
and you can get close to them.

346
00:16:52,083 --> 00:16:53,250
Kinda like this.

347
00:16:53,333 --> 00:16:55,375
No way! I'm not
frenching a frog!

348
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:57,000
[ASUKA] That's it, I
don't care if I ever master

349
00:16:57,083 --> 00:16:58,583
summoning as long as I live.

350
00:16:58,666 --> 00:16:59,750
I'm throwing in the towel.

351
00:16:59,833 --> 00:17:01,291
I never said
you had to kiss it,

352
00:17:01,375 --> 00:17:03,083
but you need to be
comfortable around it.

353
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:04,291
She's got a good point.

354
00:17:04,375 --> 00:17:05,541
The reason we're
out here is because

355
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:06,875
we want you to succeed.

356
00:17:06,958 --> 00:17:08,500
We're only wasting our
time if you don't give it

357
00:17:08,583 --> 00:17:10,958
your all, Asuka.
So please stick with it!

358
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:14,708
'Kay, I'll try.
I'm sorry I'm so whiny.

359
00:17:14,791 --> 00:17:16,291
I know you're just trying
to help and the last thing

360
00:17:16,375 --> 00:17:19,083
I wanna do is
let you guys down.

361
00:17:19,166 --> 00:17:20,500
[KIRIYA] So the creature
she's destined to summon

362
00:17:20,583 --> 00:17:23,041
is the one she's
most afraid of, huh?

363
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:25,208
That's unfortunate.
But at least it explains

364
00:17:25,291 --> 00:17:26,875
why she was having
so much trouble.

365
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,083
Hm.

366
00:17:28,166 --> 00:17:30,041
No luck here either.
I knew finding a frog

367
00:17:30,125 --> 00:17:31,875
might be a tough job,
but I never thought

368
00:17:31,958 --> 00:17:33,666
we'd have this much trouble.

369
00:17:35,708 --> 00:17:37,916
[croaking]

370
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:39,208
Does anyone else hear that?

371
00:17:39,291 --> 00:17:41,875
[croaking]

372
00:17:41,958 --> 00:17:44,958
[Asuka screaming]

373
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,541
I know that I should've
let them find frogs

374
00:17:46,625 --> 00:17:48,750
on their own, but I have
to admit, the suspense of

375
00:17:48,833 --> 00:17:51,125
seeing her reaction
was starting to get to me.

376
00:17:51,208 --> 00:17:52,791
[laughing]

377
00:17:52,875 --> 00:17:54,500
Nice try, but
you aren't fooling me.

378
00:17:54,583 --> 00:17:56,625
Her fear of frogs isn't
the reason you're here.

379
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,666
I heard through the grapevine

380
00:17:57,750 --> 00:17:59,291
the girls were
attacked recently.

381
00:17:59,375 --> 00:18:01,958
Forgive me, I wasn't aware
that you had been informed.

382
00:18:02,041 --> 00:18:04,125
[HANZO] I assume you've
come to the same realization.

383
00:18:04,208 --> 00:18:06,083
You know what
this attack implies.

384
00:18:06,166 --> 00:18:07,541
[grunt]

385
00:18:08,708 --> 00:18:11,500
I think it's safe to say
they're already on the move.

386
00:18:23,250 --> 00:18:25,416
[WOMAN] What are you
impressions of our adversaries?

387
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,208
[HOMURA] Ma'am.
I dealt with Asuka,

388
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,958
the granddaughter of
the legendary shinobi.

389
00:18:30,041 --> 00:18:31,958
She's an idiot. To be
honest, I wouldn't even

390
00:18:32,041 --> 00:18:33,958
consider her a minor threat.

391
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:35,708
[HARUKA] The same
goes for the others.

392
00:18:35,791 --> 00:18:38,041
The poor dears barely put
up a struggle and they were

393
00:18:38,125 --> 00:18:40,666
only fighting a handful
of my adorable puppets.

394
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:42,458
[WOMAN] Then we have
no reason to fear them?

395
00:18:42,541 --> 00:18:43,666
None.

396
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:45,250
[WOMAN] We must not
underestimate the enemy

397
00:18:45,333 --> 00:18:46,833
after only one encounter.

398
00:18:46,916 --> 00:18:49,125
Carelessness leads
to death, after all.

399
00:18:49,208 --> 00:18:51,708
Follow your training and
it will lead you to victory.

400
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,375
[BOTH] Ma'am.

401
00:18:53,458 --> 00:18:55,333
[WOMAN] A full-blown
confrontation with those girls

402
00:18:55,416 --> 00:18:57,583
is inevitable, but we
shall not rush into it.

403
00:18:57,666 --> 00:18:59,541
Patience is a virtue
to be utilized.

404
00:18:59,625 --> 00:19:02,166
We will act as true shinobi,
using stealth and guile

405
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,916
so that we may eliminate
them with one swift stroke.

406
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,375
[ALL] Yes, ma'am.

407
00:19:07,041 --> 00:19:09,750
[WOMAN] Yomi. You
shall face them next.

408
00:19:09,833 --> 00:19:14,583
I'm looking forward
to it. [chuckles]

409
00:19:16,291 --> 00:19:18,375
[Aauka worried]

410
00:19:18,458 --> 00:19:20,583
Don't worry, they're
not all poisonous!

411
00:19:20,666 --> 00:19:23,291
No offense, Hibari, but
you are not exactly helping!

412
00:19:23,375 --> 00:19:24,708
What are you talking about?

413
00:19:24,791 --> 00:19:26,291
It's just a bunch of frogs
in a kiddy pool, ya' baby.

414
00:19:26,375 --> 00:19:29,000
I swear you are the
worst friends on the planet!

415
00:19:30,875 --> 00:19:33,375
Whoa, and that's the ugliest
one of the bunch, too.

416
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:37,041
[KIRIYA] Hebijo Academy?
Are you sure?

417
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,083
I'm afraid it's
the only explanation.

418
00:19:39,166 --> 00:19:40,583
After all this time,
they're finally

419
00:19:40,666 --> 00:19:42,041
revealing themselves to us.

420
00:19:42,125 --> 00:19:43,333
Evil shinobi?

421
00:19:43,416 --> 00:19:45,166
I hope our girls are
ready for what lies ahead.

422
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,833
[NARRATOR] Surprise!
What good is a story

423
00:19:46,916 --> 00:19:48,333
without an adversary?

424
00:19:48,416 --> 00:19:50,833
While our heroines strive
to maintain peace and justice,

425
00:19:50,916 --> 00:19:53,250
the members of the Hebijo
Clandestine Girls' Academy

426
00:19:53,333 --> 00:19:55,666
are all about kickin'
ass just for fun.

427
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:58,166
They are the yin to
Hanzo Academy's yang.

428
00:19:58,250 --> 00:20:00,625
And no, you perverts,
that wasn't a euphemism.

429
00:20:00,708 --> 00:20:02,958
Geez, get your minds
out of the gutter.

430
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,708
[HANZO] Even though
their training is incomplete,

431
00:20:05,791 --> 00:20:07,375
these girls are still shinobi.

432
00:20:07,458 --> 00:20:09,208
Now that Hebijo's
students are on the move,

433
00:20:09,291 --> 00:20:10,750
we must ensure
our girls are ready

434
00:20:10,833 --> 00:20:12,583
to engage them at any time.

435
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:14,791
[HANZO] I hate going
into this without

436
00:20:14,875 --> 00:20:17,041
understanding their objective,
but we must fend off

437
00:20:17,125 --> 00:20:19,125
the sparks that
will be falling our way.

438
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:20,458
[KIRIYA] Right.

439
00:20:26,166 --> 00:20:28,041
I just can't do it!

440
00:20:28,125 --> 00:20:29,375
[screaming]

441
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:32,250
[Ikaruga screaming]

442
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,583
Nice one, Ikaruga!

443
00:20:33,666 --> 00:20:35,750
Now that's what I
call leading by example!

444
00:20:35,833 --> 00:20:37,333
That's not what I'm doing!

445
00:20:38,541 --> 00:20:39,625
You should try that, Asuka!

446
00:20:39,708 --> 00:20:41,208
Just sit back and
enjoy it and you'll be

447
00:20:41,291 --> 00:20:42,875
summoning frogs
in no time at all!

448
00:20:42,958 --> 00:20:44,125
Is she enjoying that?

449
00:20:44,208 --> 00:20:45,833
I don't think
she's enjoying it.

450
00:20:45,916 --> 00:20:47,333
[IKARUGA] I can't
take it anymore!

451
00:20:47,416 --> 00:20:49,875
Someone please get it off!

452
00:20:52,916 --> 00:20:55,208
[ASUKA] It's sweet that you
wanna throw a party for Grandpa.

453
00:20:55,291 --> 00:20:56,458
But he'll get
upset if he thinks

454
00:20:56,541 --> 00:20:57,958
everybody went
out of their way.

455
00:20:58,041 --> 00:20:59,416
[IKARUGA] It's
the least we can do!

456
00:20:59,500 --> 00:21:00,791
I mean, it's a big deal.

457
00:21:00,875 --> 00:21:03,000
The man our school is
named after is visiting us.

458
00:21:03,083 --> 00:21:05,375
We need to show
him some hospitality.

459
00:21:06,083 --> 00:21:07,083
What's the matter?

460
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,708
My grandpa's an amazing man,

461
00:21:08,791 --> 00:21:11,375
but his granddaughter can't
even face a stupid tadpole.

462
00:21:11,458 --> 00:21:12,541
I'm pathetic.

463
00:21:12,625 --> 00:21:14,541
[IKARUGA] What'd I
tell you? Don't rush it.

464
00:21:14,625 --> 00:21:16,333
Yeah. But I can't
help feeling I'm

465
00:21:16,416 --> 00:21:18,291
holding the rest of
you back in training.

466
00:21:18,375 --> 00:21:20,583
Don't beat yourself
up. You're a hard worker.

467
00:21:20,666 --> 00:21:22,791
None of us doubt that
you'll master this thing.

468

So keep your chin up.

469
00:21:24,375 --> 00:21:26,791
And just focus on fighting
through your own doubts, okay?

470
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:28,916
Thanks, Ikaruga.

471
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,500
My pleasure. Besides,
I can't really say anything

472
00:21:31,583 --> 00:21:33,500
after my little freak
out earlier, you know?

Sorry about that.

[YOMI] Goodness, these
bean sprouts cost a fortune.

476
00:21:40,166 --> 00:21:42,083
Its highway robbery,
don't you think?

477
00:21:42,166 --> 00:21:44,041
Yeah, sure.

478

[ASUKA] Hey, what's
wrong? I was--!

[IKARUGA] Kiriya-sensei
told us not to

480
00:21:47,333 --> 00:21:49,458
interact with the public.

481
00:21:49,541 --> 00:21:51,625
Don't you dare ignore me
when I'm speaking to you.

482
00:21:51,708 --> 00:21:52,833
It's incredibly rude.

483
00:21:52,916 --> 00:21:55,000
Didn't anyone ever
teach you any manners?

484
00:21:56,041 --> 00:21:57,750
[YOMI] I shouldn't be
so hard on you ladies.

485
00:21:57,833 --> 00:22:00,666
After all, few are
as proper as me.

[ASUKA] Ikaruga,
help me out.

488
00:23:33,666 --> 00:23:35,500
What can I do to be
as organized as you are?

489
00:23:35,583 --> 00:23:37,166
[IKARUGA] You have to motivate
yourself and stop being

490
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:38,666
so lazy all the time.

491

[ASUKA] All right! From now on,
Asuka's gonna buckle down!

Wait, you think I'm lazy?
