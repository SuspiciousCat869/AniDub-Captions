1
00:00:07,625 --> 00:00:08,875
[evil laugh]

2
00:00:08,958 --> 00:00:11,666
[MAN] Yin and Yang.
It's amazing how the scrolls

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:15,083
respond to the fighting
spirit of these girls.

4
00:00:15,166 --> 00:00:19,000
Just a little longer.
It's so close I can taste it.

5
00:00:19,083 --> 00:00:20,833
[laughs]

6
00:00:27,875 --> 00:00:29,000
What's this?

7
00:00:31,916 --> 00:00:36,333
[steel hits steel]

8
00:00:59,875 --> 00:01:02,791
[HOMURA] You'd better say your
prayers, granddaughter of Hanzo!

9
00:01:10,416 --> 00:01:11,500
[HOMURA gasps]

10
00:01:11,583 --> 00:01:12,625
[YOUNG HOMURA]
You took advantage of me.

11
00:01:12,708 --> 00:01:16,791
Why, Komichi-sensei?
How could you?

12
00:01:16,875 --> 00:01:18,333
[KOMICHI] I was ordered
to find and eliminate

13
00:01:18,416 --> 00:01:19,833
the good ninja's successor.

14
00:01:19,916 --> 00:01:22,875
Don't take it personally;
I'm just completing my mission.

15
00:01:22,958 --> 00:01:24,375
[snickers]

16
00:01:24,458 --> 00:01:27,166
[gasps] So, it was all a lie.

17
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:28,583
The way you treated me.

18
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:30,458
I thought you actually cared,
but you were just trying

19
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,916
to get close me?

20
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,375
[KOMICHI] What can I say?
It made my job a lot easier.

21
00:01:35,458 --> 00:01:37,375
I can't believe you
lied to gain my trust!

22
00:01:37,458 --> 00:01:41,000
You know my secrets! I even
told you I'm a shinobi student!

23
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:42,291
Betrayal works best if you gain

24
00:01:42,375 --> 00:01:44,375
the other person's
trust first, Homura.

25
00:01:44,458 --> 00:01:45,625
[gasps]

26
00:01:45,708 --> 00:01:47,250
[KOMICHI] But you know,
it works even better if

27
00:01:47,333 --> 00:01:49,333
you can get them to
feel affection for you.

28
00:01:49,416 --> 00:01:50,916
[glass breaks]

29
00:01:52,416 --> 00:01:53,791
[stab]

30
00:01:55,375 --> 00:01:57,416
You've always had your
grandfather watching over you

31
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:59,208
so you don't know how
it feels to be betrayed

32
00:01:59,291 --> 00:02:00,208
by someone you love!

33
00:02:00,291 --> 00:02:02,416
I'd choose death
over that any day!

34
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,333
[HOMURA growls]

35
00:02:07,416 --> 00:02:08,916
[ASUKA] I didn't
want to do this.

36
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,333
[screams]

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,500
It looks like somebody
finally figured out

38
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:24,250
how to shift to Yin Style.

39
00:02:24,333 --> 00:02:26,875
You've gotten a lot stronger
since the last time we fought.

40
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,125
[surprised gasp]

41
00:02:34,208 --> 00:02:36,125
Damn! She's got nerve!

42
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,500
[KATSURAGI] I'm lost!

43
00:02:41,583 --> 00:02:44,291
This place is so big I feel like
I'm running around in circles!

44
00:02:44,375 --> 00:02:45,333
Ikaruga.

45
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:46,875
You shouldn't
scare me like that!

46
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:48,291
[IKARUGA] Apparently,
there are some hidden stairs

47
00:02:48,375 --> 00:02:49,458
up ahead of us.

48
00:02:52,875 --> 00:02:53,750
Whoa, it's a freakin' map

49
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,791
of the whole castle!

50
00:02:54,875 --> 00:02:56,208
How did you get
your hands on this?

51
00:02:56,291 --> 00:02:57,708
Someone shot
an arrow at me earlier

52
00:02:57,791 --> 00:02:58,958
and the map was attached to it.

53
00:02:59,041 --> 00:03:00,458
[KATSURAGI] Bet it's the
same person who released

54
00:03:00,541 --> 00:03:03,333
the stairs for me and Yagyu!
Who do ya think it could be?

55
00:03:03,416 --> 00:03:05,083
It must be her.

56
00:03:06,958 --> 00:03:08,166
[SUZUNE] Yes.

57
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,125
It's only a matter
of time before the girls

58
00:03:10,208 --> 00:03:12,375
and the scrolls
finally come together.

59
00:03:12,458 --> 00:03:13,875
[KIRIYA] I don't suppose
you'd care to tell me

60
00:03:13,958 --> 00:03:15,458
what you're planning?

61
00:03:15,541 --> 00:03:18,208
[SUZUNE] What brings you here?
Worried about your students?

62
00:03:18,291 --> 00:03:23,416
[KIRIYA] No. At least, not all
of my students. Just one.

63
00:03:24,583 --> 00:03:27,041
[SUZUNE] I simply want
to prove a point, Sensei.

64
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:30,625
[SUZUNE] After I failed
my mission, I realized that

65
00:03:30,708 --> 00:03:34,000
I could never attain
true power as a good ninja,

66
00:03:34,083 --> 00:03:36,875
because it can
only be found in evil.

67
00:03:38,791 --> 00:03:40,958
I knew that in order
to prove that to you,

68
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:44,916
I'd have to prevail against
your current shinobi students.

69
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,916
[KIRIYA] In other words, your
half-hearted attacks on Hanzo

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,083
were meant to strengthen my
girls so you could defeat them

71
00:03:50,166 --> 00:03:51,583
to prove your point?

72
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:55,166
[SUZUNE] I knew the fear
of an impending attack would

73
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,166
push you to train them harder.

74
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:59,958
And look how far they've
come in such a short time.

75
00:04:00,041 --> 00:04:02,416
Very impressive, Kiriya-Sensei.

76
00:04:03,666 --> 00:04:04,916
When the students chosen by

77
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,458
the super-secret
ninja art scrolls fought,

78
00:04:07,541 --> 00:04:11,000
and my student came out on top,
I thought I was well on my way

79
00:04:11,083 --> 00:04:14,333
to achieving my lifelong goal
of becoming a super ninja.

80
00:04:16,208 --> 00:04:18,833
That is, until the
Yin scroll made its way here.

81
00:04:18,916 --> 00:04:20,041
[KIRIYA] Hold on.

82
00:04:20,125 --> 00:04:22,125
You didn't order them
to take the scroll?

83
00:04:22,208 --> 00:04:24,666
[SUZUNE] No, the order
was given by Hebijo's owner

84
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:26,166
and headmaster, Dogen.

85
00:04:26,250 --> 00:04:28,833
He went behind my back and
contacted the girls directly.

86
00:04:28,916 --> 00:04:30,250
[KIRIYA] What the
hell was he thinking?

87
00:04:30,333 --> 00:04:32,541
Doesn't he know uniting
the Yin and Yang scrolls

88
00:04:32,625 --> 00:04:34,041
is strictly forbidden?

89
00:04:34,125 --> 00:04:36,083
[SUZUNE] This didn't play
out the way I would've liked,

90
00:04:36,166 --> 00:04:39,583
but I must say I'm relieved that
it will all be settled soon.

91
00:04:39,666 --> 00:04:42,166
One of your students
will succeed to the Yin scroll,

92
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,666
and one of mine to the Yang.

93
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:46,375
Once that happens, the two
girls will be forced to fight.

94
00:04:46,458 --> 00:04:48,083
[KIRIYA] No, we have
to put a stop to this!

95
00:04:48,166 --> 00:04:49,333
[steel clangs]

96
00:04:49,416 --> 00:04:51,666
[SUZUNE] Let the kids
have their fun, Sensei.

97
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,666
This isn't our fight,
it's theirs.

98
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:58,458
I think it's best we just stand
back and watch what unfolds.

99
00:04:58,541 --> 00:04:59,750
[KIRIYA gasps]

100
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,750
[SUZUNE] Daidoji!

101
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:10,625
[DAIDOJI] It's been
a long time, Rin.

102
00:05:10,708 --> 00:05:12,750
I think it's a shame that
our reunion was brought about

103
00:05:12,833 --> 00:05:15,000
by such unfortunate
circumstances.

104
00:05:15,083 --> 00:05:17,750
[SUZUNE] It's good to see you
again, my dear underclassman.

105
00:05:17,833 --> 00:05:20,375
Are you still waiting
to defeat me to graduate?

106
00:05:20,458 --> 00:05:23,041
[DAIDOJI] Not anymore.
I've waited long enough.

107
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,250
I've decided that I will
graduate when my underclassmen

108
00:05:26,333 --> 00:05:27,875
crush your students!

109
00:05:27,958 --> 00:05:29,708
[IKARUGA] Are you sure this
is the way to the top floor?

110
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:30,583
[KATSURAGI] Yeah!

111
00:05:34,041 --> 00:05:36,333
[YOMI giggles]

112
00:05:36,416 --> 00:05:37,875
There's no
getting away from us.

113
00:05:37,958 --> 00:05:39,208
[HIKAGE] You can run--

114
00:05:40,833 --> 00:05:42,208
--but you can't hide, Blondie.

115
00:05:42,291 --> 00:05:43,500
I'm only avoiding
you 'cause I know

116
00:05:43,583 --> 00:05:44,791
you'll die if you lose!

117
00:05:44,875 --> 00:05:46,166
You should thank me
for not kickin' your ass!

118
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:48,375
What does it matter
to you whether I live or die?

119
00:05:48,458 --> 00:05:51,541
Besides, you can't beat me so
it's not like I'm in danger.

120
00:05:52,791 --> 00:05:54,500
[KATSURAGI]
It just pisses me off.

121
00:05:54,583 --> 00:05:56,333
Can't you see that
asshole's got your lives

122
00:05:56,416 --> 00:05:57,875
in the palm of his hand?

123
00:05:57,958 --> 00:05:59,875
I guess you're not
one to follow orders, huh?

124
00:05:59,958 --> 00:06:01,333
Listen, there's a big difference

125
00:06:01,416 --> 00:06:04,041
between followin' orders,
and handin' your life over

126
00:06:04,125 --> 00:06:05,291
to somebody else!

127
00:06:06,875 --> 00:06:09,083
[KATSURAGI] Now get outta my
way, 'cause I'm comin' through.

128
00:06:11,041 --> 00:06:12,750
There's that
look in your eyes again.

129
00:06:12,833 --> 00:06:14,625
Whenever you stare
at me like that,

130
00:06:14,708 --> 00:06:16,750
this weird sensation
washes over me.

131
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:18,375
I don't know how
to describe it.

132
00:06:18,458 --> 00:06:20,375
Could it be emotion?

133
00:06:20,458 --> 00:06:21,875
No way.

134
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:23,583
I learned you can't be a warrior
if you wear your emotions

135
00:06:23,666 --> 00:06:25,125
on your sleeve.

136
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,416
But you do and then it
brings it out in me!

137
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:30,333
It makes me so
angry! [grunts]

138
00:06:30,416 --> 00:06:32,291
'Bout damn time
you felt somethin'!

139
00:06:35,375 --> 00:06:38,000
I don't understand
why you piss me off so much!

140
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:39,583
Go ahead.

141
00:06:39,666 --> 00:06:41,666
You may not wanna hear this but
I like you much better this way.

142
00:06:41,750 --> 00:06:43,458
For once, I can
tell you're human.

143
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,791
[chuckles]

144
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:48,625
You know what to do.

145
00:06:48,708 --> 00:06:49,541
Yeah!

146
00:06:49,625 --> 00:06:51,458
We're pullin' a
"Kiriya-sensei"!

147
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,333
[YOMI coughs]

148
00:06:55,416 --> 00:06:56,791
[YOMI] That's the
oldest trick in the book.

149
00:06:56,875 --> 00:06:58,583
[HIKAGE] We know they're
headed to the top level.

150
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,791
We'll have to cut 'em off
before they get there.

151
00:07:00,875 --> 00:07:01,875
[YOMI] Yeah.

152
00:07:04,916 --> 00:07:06,375
[IKARUGA] If my family
cared half as much,

153
00:07:06,458 --> 00:07:08,375
I wouldn't have
suffered like I did.

154
00:07:08,458 --> 00:07:11,375
[HIKAGE] Yomi. Is
there something wrong?

155
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:14,708
Oh, no. I'm fine,
but I am worried about you.

156
00:07:14,791 --> 00:07:16,125
Why?

157
00:07:16,208 --> 00:07:17,333
Well, I've never seen
you have an emotional outburst

158
00:07:17,416 --> 00:07:18,458
like that before.

159
00:07:18,541 --> 00:07:20,291
I didn't know
you had a temper.

160
00:07:21,666 --> 00:07:23,291
Neither did I.

161
00:07:23,833 --> 00:07:24,416
[whip]

162
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,833
[HIBARI whimpers]

163
00:07:25,916 --> 00:07:27,791
[HARUKA] Don't tell me
you're giving up already?

164
00:07:27,875 --> 00:07:28,875
[HARUKA] If you're not
gonna put up a fight,

165
00:07:28,958 --> 00:07:30,208
you could at least
scream a little.

166
00:07:30,291 --> 00:07:31,625
Otherwise, this is no fun.

167
00:07:31,708 --> 00:07:32,791
[whip]

168
00:07:32,875 --> 00:07:36,291
[whimper, scream]

169
00:07:36,375 --> 00:07:38,416
[chuckle]

170
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,583
[gasp]

171
00:07:39,666 --> 00:07:42,000
[machine sounds]

172
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:43,375
[gasps] What the--?

173
00:07:47,083 --> 00:07:48,625
[YAGYU] Touch her again--

174
00:07:48,708 --> 00:07:50,916
--and you'll regret it.

175
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,625
You came to rescue me!

176
00:07:52,708 --> 00:07:53,666
[HARUKA giggles]

177
00:07:53,750 --> 00:07:55,000
I had a feeling
that you'd show up.

178
00:07:55,083 --> 00:07:56,875
[YAGYU] Stop tormenting Hibari!

179
00:07:56,958 --> 00:07:58,458
Aw, do you need
some attention?

180
00:07:58,541 --> 00:08:01,000
Well, I wouldn't mind having
a little fun with you, too!

181
00:08:07,125 --> 00:08:08,458
[crash]

182
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:10,958
[MIRAI] Thought you
could get away from me, huh?

183
00:08:11,041 --> 00:08:12,208
Don't shoot!

184
00:08:12,291 --> 00:08:13,750
[HARUKA] Ugh, you've got
the worst timing, Mirai.

185
00:08:13,833 --> 00:08:15,875
You always barge in just as
things are getting interesting.

186
00:08:15,958 --> 00:08:17,375
Don't get your
panties in a bunch!

187
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:19,625
The rest of us deserve to have
a little fun, too, y'know!

188
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,666
This is no time for you
two to be bickering!

189
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,375
So stop!

190
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,291
[MIRAI shouts]

191
00:08:24,375 --> 00:08:25,625
[YAGYU yells]

192
00:08:25,708 --> 00:08:26,708
[HARUKA grunts]

193
00:08:27,541 --> 00:08:28,208
[YAGYU] You wanna try?

194
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:29,541
[HIBARI] Let's do it!

195
00:08:29,625 --> 00:08:30,958
[BOTH] Secret ninja art!

196
00:08:31,041 --> 00:08:32,541
Come to me, Mr. Bunny!

197
00:08:32,625 --> 00:08:33,833
Hope this works!

198
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:35,875
[HARUKA gasps]

199
00:08:35,958 --> 00:08:36,958
[MIRAI gasps]

200
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:38,666
[crashes]

201
00:08:52,041 --> 00:08:54,750
[HARUKA] They performed
a joint secret ninja art.

202
00:08:54,833 --> 00:08:57,875
[MIRAI] I didn't even
know that was possible.

203
00:08:57,958 --> 00:09:01,375
[HARUKA] Ninjutsu is
a skill of the mind.

204
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:03,000
One of the most
important things I learned

205
00:09:03,083 --> 00:09:04,416
from Suzune-sensei.

206
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,708
And it's true.

207
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:07,958
What we witnessed
is undeniable proof.

208
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:09,875
Shinobi can do anything
they put their mind to,

209
00:09:09,958 --> 00:09:11,875
even the impossible.

210
00:09:11,958 --> 00:09:14,291
I envy their friendship.

211
00:09:14,375 --> 00:09:16,083
Me too.

212
00:09:19,250 --> 00:09:21,250
C'mon! Let's
go after them, Mirai!

213
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,500
[thunder]

214
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:32,833
[gasps]

215
00:09:32,916 --> 00:09:34,916
But I thought I ditched
you! I mean, how did--?

216
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,916
[HOMURA] There's more than one
way to get to the top level!

217
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:39,458
And I know every nook
and cranny of this place!

218
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:41,666
Secret ninja art: First Strike!

219
00:09:43,125 --> 00:09:45,666
[ASUKA] Secret ninja art:
Double Sword Slice!

220
00:09:49,166 --> 00:09:50,250
[DOGEN laughs]

221
00:09:50,333 --> 00:09:51,750
Yes, that's it!

222
00:09:51,833 --> 00:09:54,583
Fight until only one
of you is left standing!

223
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:56,875
I wonder which
one will prevail.

224
00:09:56,958 --> 00:09:58,583
[chuckles]

225
00:10:03,041 --> 00:10:04,666
[ASUKA] Why are we
doing this, Homura?

226
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:06,875
There's no point in us
fighting each other!

227
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,958
[DOGEN] Congratulations, ladies.
You are the chosen ones!

228
00:10:19,041 --> 00:10:19,958
[ASUKA] Who's he?

229
00:10:20,041 --> 00:10:21,458
[HOMURA] That you,
Master Dogen?

230
00:10:23,833 --> 00:10:25,625
What's this
"chosen one" crap?

231
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:26,875
Dogen?

232
00:10:26,958 --> 00:10:28,708
Could he be the headmaster
Hibari mentioned?

233
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:30,041
Listen, Homura.

234
00:10:30,125 --> 00:10:31,833
It is imperative that you
and the Hanzo girl come

235
00:10:31,916 --> 00:10:33,750
to my office immediately.

236
00:10:33,833 --> 00:10:35,083
You will be released
to the guidance

237
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,958
of your respective super-secret
ninja art scrolls.

238
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:39,291
Me and Asuka?

239
00:10:39,375 --> 00:10:42,000
Master Dogen, what in
the hell's goin' on?

240
00:10:42,083 --> 00:10:43,458
You two are
the chosen ones;

241
00:10:43,541 --> 00:10:45,375
the divine representatives
of the scrolls.

242
00:10:45,458 --> 00:10:47,833
And as such, you have the
ability to obtain the power

243
00:10:47,916 --> 00:10:49,250
of both Yin and Yang.

244
00:10:49,333 --> 00:10:51,708
Therefore, I am commanding
you to deliver that power

245
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:53,375
directly into my hands.

246
00:10:53,458 --> 00:10:55,041
What? Are you kiddin' me?

247
00:10:55,125 --> 00:10:57,291
There's no way the
organization would allow--

248
00:10:57,375 --> 00:10:59,125
[grunts]

249
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:00,833
[DOGEN] I gave you
an order, Homura.

250
00:11:00,916 --> 00:11:03,041
Hebijo Clandestine Girls'
Academy and its students

251
00:11:03,125 --> 00:11:04,291
are nothing to me;

252
00:11:04,375 --> 00:11:06,333
they're merely a means
to achieving my dream.

253
00:11:06,416 --> 00:11:07,541
Once I've
attained the power

254
00:11:07,625 --> 00:11:09,291
of the Yin and Yang
scrolls, the evil ninja,

255
00:11:09,375 --> 00:11:12,125
and all other shinobi, will be
forced to bow down before me!

256
00:11:12,208 --> 00:11:16,000
You seriously want me
to betray the organization?

257
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,250
[KATSURAGI] Asuka!

258
00:11:19,333 --> 00:11:19,875
[HIBARI] Are you all right?

259
00:11:19,958 --> 00:11:21,000
Hey, you guys!

260
00:11:26,083 --> 00:11:27,208
What'd you do to her?

261
00:11:27,291 --> 00:11:29,375
What is the meaning
of this, Master Dogen?

262
00:11:29,458 --> 00:11:32,041
That bastard was just
using us to get his hands

263
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,000
on the power of the scrolls.

264
00:11:34,083 --> 00:11:37,041
He tried to get me to
betray the organization.

265
00:11:37,125 --> 00:11:38,500
[MIRAI] What?

266
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:40,875
[chuckles] Y'know.

267
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:43,333
Can't say I'm surprised he
turned out to be a traitor.

268
00:11:43,416 --> 00:11:44,791
Am I the only
one who's confused here?

269
00:11:44,875 --> 00:11:46,708
[HIKAGE] Don't
sweat the details.

270
00:11:46,791 --> 00:11:49,500
All you really need to know
is Dogen's our target.

271
00:11:49,583 --> 00:11:50,833
Yeah?

272
00:11:50,916 --> 00:11:52,833
Then you'd better start
sayin' your prayers, pops!

273
00:11:59,708 --> 00:12:01,333
If that's how it's gonna be.

274
00:12:04,958 --> 00:12:06,333
[deep pulse]

275
00:12:11,833 --> 00:12:13,458
[IKARUGA] A shinobi kekkai?

276
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:18,625
[HIBARI] They're gone!
But where did they go?

277
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:21,000
[YOMI] Don't tell me.

278
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:24,000
Dogen must've pulled
them into the kekkai!

279
00:12:38,375 --> 00:12:39,458
[ASUKA] Where are we?

280
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:41,583
[HOMURA] We're inside
a shinobi kekkai.

281
00:12:41,666 --> 00:12:43,666
If you'd followed my
orders I wouldn't have to go

282
00:12:43,750 --> 00:12:46,708
to such extremes.
Now I've no choice.

283
00:12:46,791 --> 00:12:50,541
Here's my secret
ninja art. Giant Serpent!

284
00:12:52,125 --> 00:12:54,166
[SERPENT roars]

285
00:12:59,833 --> 00:13:01,416
Holy crap! What the
hell are these things?

286
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:03,500
They're robots,
mechanical shinobi.

287
00:13:03,583 --> 00:13:05,833
Dogen has an entire
army protecting him.

288
00:13:05,916 --> 00:13:07,000
Mechanical?

289
00:13:11,166 --> 00:13:13,041
Don't get the wrong idea;
I wasn't saving you.

290
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:16,291
I simply saw an opportunity to
strike one down so I took it!

291
00:13:16,375 --> 00:13:18,500
I can't blame you for
being wary but don't forget

292
00:13:18,583 --> 00:13:20,000
we're on the same team now!

293
00:13:20,583 --> 00:13:21,583
I know.

294
00:13:21,666 --> 00:13:22,958
But I'm still
keeping an eye on you.

295
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,916
That was a nice move!

296
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:36,833
You're right, it was.

297
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,916
Ugh, well so much for humility!

298
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,958
[HARUKA] Uh-oh,
they're surrounded.

299
00:13:40,041 --> 00:13:42,291
[HIBARI] Oh, no!
What're you doin'?

300
00:13:42,375 --> 00:13:44,541
It's important for you
conserve your strength now.

301
00:13:44,625 --> 00:13:47,125
There's a job coming up
that only you can pull off.

302
00:13:55,625 --> 00:13:56,500
[HOMURA] Damn it!

303
00:13:56,583 --> 00:13:57,625
[DOGEN] Try as you might,

304
00:13:57,708 --> 00:13:59,833
there's no defeating
my Giant Serpent.

305
00:13:59,916 --> 00:14:02,625
You're a traitor!
You betrayed me.

306
00:14:02,708 --> 00:14:05,000
Just like he did!

307
00:14:05,083 --> 00:14:08,166
[DOGEN] And you have no
one to blame but yourself!

308
00:14:08,250 --> 00:14:10,666
Perhaps if you
weren't so foolish,

309
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:14,125
you'd know better than to fall
for the same trick twice.

310
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:19,166
[HOMURA laughs maniacally]

311
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,625
[ASUKA] Homura?

312
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:23,625
[HOMURA] Seems you don't know,
who you're messin' with.

313
00:14:23,708 --> 00:14:27,458
The last man who betrayed me,
didn't live to talk about it.

314
00:14:27,541 --> 00:14:28,500
Did you honestly

00:21:19,833 --> 00:21:21,541
[SUZUNE] True power has
nothing to do with whether

473
00:21:21,625 --> 00:21:23,208
a ninja is good or evil.

474
00:21:23,291 --> 00:21:25,625
And that is the lesson
my students taught

475
00:21:25,708 --> 00:21:27,583
their teacher today.

476
00:21:27,666 --> 00:21:29,541
Some sensei
I turned out to be.

477
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:33,291
What do
you think you're doing?

478
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,500
You're going to fall!

479
00:21:34,583 --> 00:21:37,208
Goodbye, Sensei.
Please don't ever forget me.

480
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:37,916
[KIRIYA gasps]

481
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:38,541
[DOGEN grunts]

482
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,000
[DAIDOJI] No!

483
00:21:41,833 --> 00:21:42,708
[GIRLS gasps]

484
00:21:42,791 --> 00:21:44,500
[KIRIYA] Rin!

485
00:22:11,583 --> 00:22:12,791
[ALL] Welcome back!

486
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,333
[IKARUGA] Welcome back!
Everything go okay?

487
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:15,916
Yep, I'm happy
to say that I passed

488
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,375
my advancement test!

489
00:22:17,458 --> 00:22:19,625
Congratulations, Asuka.
I knew you could do it!

490
00:22:19,708 --> 00:22:20,750
[KATSURAGI] Good goin',
Boobalicious!

491
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:22,166
[ASUKA] Cut it out!

492
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,875
I swear, I'm never sharing
good news with you again!

493
00:22:23,958 --> 00:22:25,666
[HIBARI] It took you a while,
but you've finally made it

494
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,333
to the same level as Yagyu!

495
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:30,416
[ASUKA] What? Aw, man.
Thanks a lot.

496
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,791
You just had to go and
remind me, didn't you?

497
00:22:32,875 --> 00:22:34,000
[GIRLS cough]

498
00:22:34,083 --> 00:22:35,333
[KIRIYA] So I hear
you passed your test.

499
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:37,083
[ASUKA] Yeah! I did my best!

500
00:22:37,166 --> 00:22:39,125
About time you reached
the same rank as Yagyu,

501
00:22:39,208 --> 00:22:40,375
your underclassman.

502
00:22:40,458 --> 00:22:43,166
[whimpers] Geez! Sorry
I'm such a late bloomer.

503
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:44,416
[KIRIYA] Nonsense.

504
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:46,375
You've made me, and your
grandfather, very proud.

505
00:22:46,458 --> 00:22:48,958
I'm glad you're home.
Now we can start training again.

506
00:22:49,041 --> 00:22:51,208
Hope you ladies are ready to get
back into the swing of things.

507
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:53,000
[ALL] Yes, sir!

508
00:22:53,083 --> 00:22:54,791
But first,
I should tell you.

509
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,041
Headquarters sent me

510
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:58,291
a report on the Hebijo
Academy investigation.

511
00:23:01,875 --> 00:23:03,583
[KIRIYA] Officials searched
through the castle's ashes with

512
00:23:03,666 --> 00:23:07,958
a fine-toothed comb, but there
was no sign of the elite five.

513
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:11,125
[IKARUGA] Do you
think that means

514
00:23:11,208 --> 00:23:12,916
they got out of there safely?

515
00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:17,833
[YAGYU] There's no
way of knowing but

516
00:23:17,916 --> 00:23:20,375
I choose to believe they did.

517
00:23:20,458 --> 00:23:22,500
[HIBARI] Yeah, you
know what? Me, too!

518
00:23:24,250 --> 00:23:25,416
[KATSURAGI] They're
tough as nails.

519
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,666
They'll be back to pick
a fight with us someday.

520
00:23:36,625 --> 00:23:39,375
[ASUKA] Somehow, I just know
that we'll see them again.
