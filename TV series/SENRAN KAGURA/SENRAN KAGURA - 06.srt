00:09:49,958 --> 00:09:52,208
I still can't
believe she's gone.

164
00:09:54,166 --> 00:09:55,916
[KIRIYA] What're you doing?

165
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
[YAGYU] If I can get Hibari
to sense my presence,

166
00:09:58,083 --> 00:10:00,083
I'm sure she'll
call to me for help.

167
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:02,583
Then I'll be able to force
my way back inside the kekkai.

168
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,666
[KIRIYA] You can't!

169
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:05,416
Please don't put
your life on the line!

170
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:07,500
I'll do whatever it
takes to protect her.

171
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,541
[KIRIYA] No!
It's too dangerous!

172
00:10:09,625 --> 00:10:11,000
[YAGYU] C'mon, Hibari.

173
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:13,041
You can do it.

174
00:10:13,125 --> 00:10:14,416
Sense my presence!

175
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,250
[HARUKA] There's no need
for you to be afraid of me.

176
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:18,166
I just wanna play!

177
00:10:18,791 --> 00:10:20,458
What's the matter, cutie?

178
00:10:20,541 --> 00:10:22,291
You don't wanna play with me?

179
00:10:22,375 --> 00:10:24,000
No! I don't think it's fair

180
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,916
'cause you're a
lot stronger than me!

181
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,416
But I'm gonna do
my best to beat you!

182
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:33,708
[Hibari wailing]

183
00:10:37,416 --> 00:10:39,083
[HARUKA] Why are
you being so cruel?

184
00:10:39,166 --> 00:10:40,250
I mean, can't you
see that I'm just

185
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,041
trying to be friends with you?

186
00:10:42,125 --> 00:10:43,708
[HARUKA] Good friends.

187
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,125
Secret Ninja Art Bunny!

188
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:53,166
Ugh.

189
00:10:54,083 --> 00:10:55,875
Ninja Bunny Boom Boom!

190
00:10:57,291 --> 00:10:58,666
[HARUKA] Ugh!

191
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:04,666
[HIBARI] Thanks
again, Mr. Bunny!

192
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,750
[HARUKA] Well, that was fun.

193
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:08,208
[HARUKA] Here's an idea.

194
00:11:08,291 --> 00:11:10,333
How would you like to see
some evil ninja techniques?

195
00:11:10,416 --> 00:11:12,208
After all, it's only
fair I show you mine

196
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:14,500
now that you've shown
me yours, right cutie?

197
00:11:14,583 --> 00:11:17,375
Uh. No, thank you!
I don't wanna see 'em!

198
00:11:17,458 --> 00:11:20,375
[HARUKA] Ah! Mockery
Meta-applications!

199
00:11:20,458 --> 00:11:22,416
Greed Vectors!

200
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,291
Angles Traced by Inevitability!

201
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,958
It's over.

202
00:11:30,041 --> 00:11:35,250
I tried my best, Yagyu,
but I wasn't strong enough.

203
00:11:38,583 --> 00:11:39,958
[YAGYU] Hibari?

204
00:11:40,041 --> 00:11:41,875
Sense my presence!

205
00:11:41,958 --> 00:11:43,958
Can you hear me?

206
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:45,625
Hibari!

207
00:11:45,708 --> 00:11:47,166
Yeah, I can hear you.

208
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:49,083
[YAGYU] I wanna protect you,
but the only way I can do that

209
00:11:49,166 --> 00:11:51,041
is if you call to me for help!

210
00:11:51,125 --> 00:11:52,625
Do it!

211
00:11:53,541 --> 00:11:55,166
Hurry, Yagyu!

212
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,625
Help me!

213
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:58,166
Please!

214
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,041
[HARUKA] Aw, poor thing.

215
00:12:01,125 --> 00:12:03,208
I must've spanked her too hard.

216
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,458
What?

217
00:12:07,541 --> 00:12:11,833
[struggling]

218
00:12:11,916 --> 00:12:14,375
Well, isn't this grand?

219
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:30,625
[YAGYU] Hibari.

220
00:12:33,875 --> 00:12:35,458
You really came to help me.

221
00:12:35,541 --> 00:12:37,791
I called to you,
and you're here.

222
00:12:37,875 --> 00:12:39,416
[YAGYU] Are you all right?

223
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,083
I'm more worried about
you. I can tell you're hurt.

224
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,208
[YAGYU] Don't
worry. I'll be fine.

225
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,416
Yagyu.

226
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:47,041
[HARUKA] Where
are your manners?

227
00:12:47,125 --> 00:12:50,333
How dare you barge
into my kekkai uninvited?

228
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,708
[YAGYU] How dare you
hurt my best friend?

229
00:12:52,791 --> 00:12:54,125
You'll pay for this!

230
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:56,041
I sure hope you're not thinking
about trying to snatch

231
00:12:56,125 --> 00:12:58,083
my little puppet away from me.

232
00:12:59,166 --> 00:13:00,750
'Cause I'm not gonna
let that happen!

233
00:13:00,833 --> 00:13:02,208
[YAGYU] Ugh.

234
00:13:05,041 --> 00:13:06,875
First you barge into my
kekkai and now you don't even

235
00:13:06,958 --> 00:13:08,666
have the strength
to dodge my attacks.

236
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:10,875
This just isn't your
day is it, sweetheart?

237
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:12,500
I'm surprised your
sensei never warned you

238
00:13:12,583 --> 00:13:15,750
about the physical dangers of
forcing your way into barriers.

239
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:17,916
You got those injuries

240
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,833
'cause you came
in here to save me?

241
00:13:19,916 --> 00:13:22,458
It's all my fault.
I'm sorry, Yagyu!

242
00:13:22,541 --> 00:13:24,166
I never would've
called to you for help

243
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:25,541
if I'd known you'd get hurt!

244
00:13:25,625 --> 00:13:28,708
It was me! I was the one
who called to you, remember?

245
00:13:28,791 --> 00:13:29,958
[HIBARI] Please be careful!

246
00:13:30,041 --> 00:13:32,208
[HARUKA] Ugh, you reek of sweat!

247
00:13:32,291 --> 00:13:34,208
Whaddaya say we hurry
and get this over with

248
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,000
before I start gagging!

249
00:13:36,083 --> 00:13:38,208
This is my Secret Ninja Art.

250
00:13:38,291 --> 00:13:40,125
Kiss of Death!

251
00:13:42,125 --> 00:13:44,416
[HIBARI] Ahhh!

252
00:13:48,625 --> 00:13:51,041
No! Yagyu!

253
00:13:51,125 --> 00:13:53,041
[HARUKA] Such an
unlikeable little girl.

254
00:13:53,125 --> 00:13:55,875
She's not even worthy
of being my puppet.

255
00:13:57,125 --> 00:13:58,458
Please don't hurt her!

256
00:13:58,541 --> 00:14:01,000
She was only
trying to protect me!

257
00:14:01,083 --> 00:14:02,750
Aren't you adorable?

258
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:04,333
[gasp]

259
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:07,166
How could I ever say no to that
precious little face of yours?

260
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
I'll spare her
under one condition.

261
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,500
[HARUKA] All I ask is that
you promise to be my friend

262
00:14:11,583 --> 00:14:13,208
from this day forward.

263
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:15,208
[HIBARI] What is this?

264
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:19,166
For you. It's a token
of our newfound friendship.

265
00:14:19,250 --> 00:14:20,625
[HARUKA] Take care of it.

266
00:14:20,708 --> 00:14:22,333
Ciao, cutie.

267
00:14:26,875 --> 00:14:32,708
[clanging]

268
00:14:32,791 --> 00:14:34,166
[HOMURA] Ah!

269
00:14:35,166 --> 00:14:36,541
[ASUKA] Ugh!

270
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:45,958
[ASUKA] Ahhh!

271
00:14:46,041 --> 00:14:47,875
Game over, Asuka!

272
00:14:47,958 --> 00:14:49,791
[ASUKA] I'm just
gettin' started!

273
00:14:49,875 --> 00:14:51,541
[ASUKA] Secret Ninja Art!

274
00:14:54,916 --> 00:14:57,000
[ASUKA] Double Sword Slice!

275
00:14:59,125 --> 00:15:01,750
Hm. That's one
lousy attack ya got there.

276
00:15:01,833 --> 00:15:04,000
[ASUKA] My Secret Ninja
Art didn't even faze her?

277
00:15:04,083 --> 00:15:05,291
Crap! Now what?

278
00:15:05,375 --> 00:15:06,375
[HOMURA] Guess we've
been trainin' a lot harder

279
00:15:06,458 --> 00:15:09,250
than you guys!
You're no match for me!

280
00:15:10,250 --> 00:15:11,250
[power yell]

281
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:13,416
Ahhh!

282
00:15:16,875 --> 00:15:18,583
Ya see? What did I tell you?

283
00:15:18,666 --> 00:15:20,833
You're so pathetically
weak you can't even handle

284
00:15:20,916 --> 00:15:22,583
a single attack from me!

285
00:15:23,583 --> 00:15:29,291
[ASUKA] Are all... of the Hebijo
girls... as strong as you are?

286
00:15:29,375 --> 00:15:33,083
If so, then... I hope
the others are all right!

287
00:15:33,166 --> 00:15:35,000
You know, if I were you
I wouldn't waste my time

288
00:15:35,083 --> 00:15:37,333
worryin' about anybody
but myself right now.

289
00:15:37,416 --> 00:15:39,666
You're the only
person you can depend on!

290
00:15:39,750 --> 00:15:42,083
Everyone else will
just disappoint you!

291
00:15:42,166 --> 00:15:44,583
You don't seriously
believe that.

292
00:15:44,666 --> 00:15:45,708
[HOMURA] Yeah, I do.

293
00:15:45,791 --> 00:15:46,875
But if you
think like that,

294
00:15:46,958 --> 00:15:48,625
you'll never have any friends.

295
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,208
Homura, that's not
what you want, is it?

296
00:15:51,291 --> 00:15:52,875
To live your life all alone?

297
00:15:52,958 --> 00:15:54,875
Think I give a crap
what you have to say?

298
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:57,291
You've got no right
to lecture me, got it?

299
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:03,666
Did you feel that?

300
00:16:03,750 --> 00:16:05,458
The kekkai has weakened.

301
00:16:05,541 --> 00:16:08,083
Hey, what happened?

302
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:10,125
[HARUKA] Fall back, ladies.

303
00:16:10,208 --> 00:16:12,166
What? But why, Haruka?

304
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:14,375
The kekkai
barrier is collapsing!

305
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:16,625
[HARUKA] Mirai was
defeated in battle.

306
00:16:16,708 --> 00:16:19,708
As a result, the kekkai link
has now become unstable.

307
00:16:19,791 --> 00:16:22,750
We're not going to be able
to maintain it much longer.

308
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:24,208
We've already
accomplished our goal

309
00:16:24,291 --> 00:16:26,458
so we might as well head back.

310
00:16:26,541 --> 00:16:29,000
Make sure you
take care of it, okay?

311
00:16:29,083 --> 00:16:31,666
I'll be seein'
ya' around real soon.

312
00:16:33,583 --> 00:16:34,958
[HIBARI] Ah!

313
00:16:36,416 --> 00:16:37,791
Damn. That's my cue.

314
00:16:37,875 --> 00:16:39,083
We're not done here!

315
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:40,500
You call yourself a shinobi

316
00:16:40,583 --> 00:16:42,375
but you don't stand a
chance against the real deal.

317
00:16:42,458 --> 00:16:44,041
I'd wipe the floor with you!

318
00:16:44,125 --> 00:16:45,791
One thing before I go.

319
00:16:45,875 --> 00:16:47,291
You're not fit to call yourself

320
00:16:47,375 --> 00:16:49,333
the granddaughter of
the legendary shinobi!

321
00:16:49,416 --> 00:16:50,875
[gasp]

322
00:16:58,416 --> 00:17:00,208
It looks like the
kekkai's been lifted.

323
00:17:00,291 --> 00:17:01,916
Ikaruga you made it!

324
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,666
They got away again, huh?

325
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,208
[ASUKA] Katsu!

326
00:17:05,291 --> 00:17:07,041
I was so worried.

327
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:10,125
Oh my gosh, what the
heck happened to her?

328
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,458
[IKARUGA] Yagyu!

329
00:17:11,541 --> 00:17:13,208
[KATSURAGI] Man, they
really roughed her up bad!

330
00:17:13,291 --> 00:17:15,750
[all talking]

331
00:17:15,833 --> 00:17:17,000
[KIRIYA] What's all
the commotion about?

332
00:17:17,083 --> 00:17:18,375
Yagyu.

333
00:17:18,458 --> 00:17:20,000
[IKARUGA] Please Yagyu,
don't give up on us.

334
00:17:20,083 --> 00:17:21,666
It's all my fault!

335
00:17:21,750 --> 00:17:23,791
You're hurt 'cause of me!

336
00:17:26,333 --> 00:17:27,958
[NARRATOR] The
State Shinobi Hospital,

337
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:30,625
an unofficial medical
facility that specializes in

338
00:17:30,708 --> 00:17:32,291
the treatment of good ninjas.

339
00:17:32,375 --> 00:17:34,708
The evil ones are on their own.

340
00:17:34,791 --> 00:17:36,541
[HIBARI] I'm sorry, Yagyu.

341
00:17:36,625 --> 00:17:39,083
I feel terrible about this.

342
00:17:39,166 --> 00:17:42,166
You went through so
much just to protect me.

343
00:17:43,708 --> 00:17:45,791
[YAGYU] And I would do
it all again if I had to.

344
00:17:45,875 --> 00:17:47,000
[HIBARI] Are you okay?

345
00:17:47,083 --> 00:17:48,375
How're you feeling?

346
00:17:48,458 --> 00:17:50,833
[YAGYU] Good, in fact,
I'll be discharged tomorrow.

347
00:17:50,916 --> 00:17:52,416
[sigh]

348
00:17:53,916 --> 00:17:55,375
[HIBARI] It's raining.

349
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,416
[HIBARI]
It's really comin' down!

350
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:02,041
It was rainin' like
this the day we met.

351
00:18:02,833 --> 00:18:04,250
[HIBARI] You remember, dontcha?

352
00:18:04,333 --> 00:18:07,083
It was the day of
the enrollment ceremony.

353
00:18:09,916 --> 00:18:12,666
[Hibari laughing]

354
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:15,291
Splishy-splashy!
Splishy-splashy!

355
00:18:15,375 --> 00:18:17,583
[Hibari laughing]

356
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,333
[NARRATOR] Yagyu stood
in shock as she watched

357
00:18:19,416 --> 00:18:22,041
the girl giggling in the rain.

358
00:18:22,125 --> 00:18:25,583
She looked exactly
like her little sister.

359
00:18:25,666 --> 00:18:28,208
But deep down she knew
there was no possible way

360
00:18:28,291 --> 00:18:30,041
that it could be her.

361
00:18:31,833 --> 00:18:33,958
I love splashin'
in puddles, don't you?

362
00:18:34,041 --> 00:18:36,208
Uh. Yeah, sure.

363
00:18:36,291 --> 00:18:38,208
The enrollment
ceremony's starting soon!

364
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:40,833
[HIBARI] We'd better hurry!
We don't wanna be late!

365
00:18:43,625 --> 00:18:46,291
[YAGYU] How could I
ever forget that day?

366
00:18:49,833 --> 00:18:52,500
[NARRATOR] Just a few months
earlier, Yagyu's little sister

367
00:18:52,583 --> 00:18:55,416
was in a horrible traffic
accident, and she could do

368
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:59,416
nothing but watch as her
sister's life faded away.

369
00:19:01,791 --> 00:19:02,875
Thanks a lot.

370
00:19:02,958 --> 00:19:04,250
[HIBARI] For what?

371
00:19:04,333 --> 00:19:06,666
For staying by
my side no matter what.

372
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:08,833
You don't know how
much it means to me.

373
00:19:08,916 --> 00:19:10,708
Mind if I stay with you
tonight so I can be here

374
00:19:10,791 --> 00:19:13,000
when they release you?

375
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:14,833
I don't mind at all.

376
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,458
[KIRIYA] None of this would've
happened if it weren't

377
00:19:18,541 --> 00:19:20,041
for my lapse in judgment.

378
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:22,166
The responsibility
is mine to bear.

379
00:19:22,250 --> 00:19:23,583
[ASUKA] That's not it, Sensei.

380
00:19:23,666 --> 00:19:25,375
[IKARUGA] We're
disappointed in ourselves.

381
00:19:25,458 --> 00:19:27,541
[KATSURAGI] Yeah. Big time.

382
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,958
Those Hebijo ninja are
way outta our league.

383
00:19:30,041 --> 00:19:31,875
We've been training hard
so I thought we might have

384
00:19:31,958 --> 00:19:34,291
a chance at winning, but
when it comes down to it,

385
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:36,500
we're still no match for them.

386
00:19:36,583 --> 00:19:38,375
[HANZO] I bet a
nutritious Futomaki roll

387
00:19:38,458 --> 00:19:39,708
will help ya get stronger!

388
00:19:39,791 --> 00:19:40,791
[all gasp]

389
00:19:40,875 --> 00:19:42,375
[chuckles]

390
00:19:43,083 --> 00:19:44,500
[ASUKA] Grandpa!
[IKARUGA] Master Hanzo!

391
00:19:44,583 --> 00:19:45,666
[KATSURAGI]
What're you doin' here?

392
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:47,041
[KIRIYA] We weren't
expecting you, sir.

393
00:19:47,125 --> 00:19:49,125
Surprise!
A black cat told me

394
00:19:49,208 --> 00:19:51,541
there was trouble,
so I came right over.

395
00:19:52,416 --> 00:19:53,833
I see.

396
00:19:56,583 --> 00:19:58,208
[slurp]

397
00:19:58,291 --> 00:19:59,833
Ah!

398
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,583
[HANZO] For some reason,
I think beautiful, young ladies

399
00:20:04,666 --> 00:20:06,166
are always at their
cutest when they're

400
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,916
eating my Futomaki rolls.

401
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,125
[ASUKA] Grandpa...

402
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,583
So tell me...

403
00:20:11,666 --> 00:20:13,708
[HANZO] Tell you what, my dear?

404
00:20:13,791 --> 00:20:15,958
Uh. Nah. Forget about it.

405
00:20:16,041 --> 00:20:17,500
Never mind!

406
00:20:17,583 --> 00:20:19,916
[HANZO] Such a
funny little girl.

407
00:20:23,166 --> 00:20:26,458
[HANZO] Even their Secret Ninja
Arts were useless against them?

408
00:20:26,541 --> 00:20:28,666
[KIRIYA] The enemy shinobi
must be training rigorously

409
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,458
to achieve that
level of strength.

410
00:20:30,541 --> 00:20:33,041
[HANZO] I've heard Hebijo
Academy training is so strenuous

411
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:36,208
that many students become
injured, some even die.

412
00:20:36,291 --> 00:20:37,416
[KIRIYA] Seriously?

413
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,708
[HANZO] There aren't
any confirmed reports

414
00:20:38,791 --> 00:20:40,041
so it could be a rumor.

415
00:20:40,125 --> 00:20:41,333
[KIRIYA] Actually,
that explains why they're

416
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:42,750
so powerful for their age.

417
00:20:42,833 --> 00:20:44,916
If they've been forced
to endure such hardships,

418
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:48,500
it's no wonder they're as
strong and devious as they are.

419
00:20:48,583 --> 00:20:50,333
The time has come.

420
00:20:50,416 --> 00:20:52,791
We must decide which girl
will be the successor

421
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,666
of the Super-Secret Ninja Art.

422
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:57,000
[KIRIYA] But they're not ready.

423
00:20:57,083 --> 00:20:58,875
Not yet.

424
00:21:00,458 --> 00:21:02,583
Hey, look who's here, everyone!

425
00:21:02,666 --> 00:21:04,083
[ALL] We're glad you're back!

426
00:21:04,166 --> 00:21:06,416
[YAGYU] Thanks, you guys!
[HIBARI] Yeah, me too!

427
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:08,583
I hate to break
the celebratory mood,

428
00:21:08,666 --> 00:21:10,500
but I need to talk to you girls.

429
00:21:13,875 --> 00:21:15,666
[IKARUGA]
Super-Secret Ninja Art?

430
00:21:15,750 --> 00:21:16,833
[ASUKA] I didn't know
there was anything

431
00:21:16,916 --> 00:21:18,625
stronger than the regular one!

432
00:21:18,708 --> 00:21:20,250
[HIBARI] The "super"
makes it sound hard!

433
00:21:20,333 --> 00:21:22,416
[YAGYU ] So only one person
can become the successor?

434
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,958
[KATSURAGI] Hell yeah!
That sounds like a job

435
00:21:24,041 --> 00:21:26,000
right up my alley!

436
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:26,875
Thanks for playin' girls,

437
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,333
but I got this one locked down!

438
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,166
Sensei's not gonna
choose you just because

439
00:21:30,250 --> 00:21:31,375
you want the job.

440
00:21:31,458 --> 00:21:33,000
Shut up! You're just
jealous 'cause you know

441
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:34,375
I'm the one he's gonna pick.

442
00:21:34,458 --> 00:21:36,916
Uh! Do you really think
you deserve it more than me?

443
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,041
[ASUKA] Hey! I think I
should get a shot at it, too!

444
00:21:39,125 --> 00:21:41,458
Now, now. No one said
Kiriya would be choosing.

445
00:21:41,541 --> 00:21:44,208
Besides, none of you are
qualified to be the successor.

446
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,291
I'll do whatever it
takes, Master Hanzo!

447
00:21:46,375 --> 00:21:48,625
So what is it we have
to do to become qualified?

448
00:21:48,708 --> 00:21:50,500
Do you want us to train
harder until you think

449
00:21:50,583 --> 00:21:52,083
we can manage it?

450
00:21:52,166 --> 00:21:54,250
I'm afraid that I have nothing
to do with the decision either.

451
00:21:54,333 --> 00:21:55,500
[KATSURAGI] Uh...

452
00:21:55,583 --> 00:21:56,958
[HANZO] The shinobi who
will become successor of

453
00:21:57,041 --> 00:22:00,166
the Super-Secret Ninja Art
can only be chosen

454
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:01,958
by the scroll itself.

455
00:22:02,041 --> 00:22:03,666
But how is that possible?

456
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:05,625
The scroll picks the person?

457
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:09,750
[SUZUNE] Did you force them into
using their Secret Ninja Arts?

458
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:11,166
[ALL] Yes, ma'am.

459
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:13,125
[SUZUNE] And when you were
unfazed by their attacks,

460
00:22:13,208 --> 00:22:16,125
did they seem surprised how much
your powers outweigh their own?

461
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,208
[ALL] Yes, ma'am.

462
00:22:17,291 --> 00:22:18,458
[SUZUNE] Good work, ladies.

463
00:22:18,541 --> 00:22:19,750
Job well done.

464
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,333
But how can you say
that when we weren't able

465
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,708
to defeat them?

466
00:22:22,791 --> 00:22:25,041
In fact, we almost
lost one of our own.

467
00:22:25,125 --> 00:22:26,375
[MIRAI] Eh.

468
00:22:26,458 --> 00:22:28,000
[SUZUNE] When given your
mission, were you ordered

469
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:29,583
to exterminate the enemy?

470
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:30,708
[HOMURA] Well, no but--

471
00:22:30,791 --> 00:22:32,375
[SUZUNE]
Mind your place, Homura.

472
00:22:33,333 --> 00:22:35,083
[SUZUNE] Shinobi perform
the duty given to them.

473
00:22:35,166 --> 00:22:36,833
Nothing more, nothing less.

474
00:22:36,916 --> 00:22:39,041
Is that understood?

475
00:22:39,125 --> 00:22:41,125
Yes ma'am,
please forgive me.

476
00:22:41,208 --> 00:22:48,875
♪

477
00:22:48,958 --> 00:22:49,958
[ASUKA] But if you
