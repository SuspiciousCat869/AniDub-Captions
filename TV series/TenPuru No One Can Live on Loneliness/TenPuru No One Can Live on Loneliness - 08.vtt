[AKAGAMI] Today,
I can finally repay everyone

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:08.863 position:24% line:89% align:start
for their kindness.

00:02:08.997 --> 00:02:11.833 position:7% line:83% align:start
First, I'll provide a selection

00:02:11.966 --> 00:02:13.835 position:16% line:89% align:start
for them all to dine on.

And then,

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.304 position:35% line:83% align:start
to Yuzuki,
who's been the kindest of all,

00:02:17.437 --> 00:02:20.842 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll present the gift I bought

But how, Akagami?

Where did you get this meat?

Eh, through an old work
connection.

It's a special occasion, right?

Marry me, Akagami, I beg you.

Well! Really! I'm flattered.

okay?

Please don't say that, Akagami!

[TSUKUYO]
You think you're joking,

All right, everyone.

Now that we're nice and full,

What's that?

00:03:18.032 --> 00:03:19.901 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is for the gift exchange.

00:03:20.034 --> 00:03:21.334 position:21% line:89% align:start
We pull these ropes,

00:03:21.468 --> 00:03:23.771 position:27% line:83% align:start
and that decides
who gets what presents.

[AKAGAMI]
No way!

The Christmas presents are being
distributed randomly?

But this present
is specifically for Yuzuki!

the others their gifts later.

00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:21.976 position:13% line:83% align:start
Am I straying from the path
of enlightenment?

00:12:22.109 --> 00:12:24.178 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm terribly sorry
to disappoint you, Mia--

00:12:24.311 --> 00:12:26.780 position:44% line:83% align:start
Okay!
Everyone get in the bath now,

00:12:26.914 --> 00:12:28.215 position:16% line:89% align:start
before you catch a cold.

00:12:28.349 --> 00:12:29.917 position:27% line:89% align:start
Playtime's over!

00:12:30.751 --> 00:12:32.253 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh, yes.

00:12:32.386 --> 00:12:33.287 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:12:35.022 --> 00:12:37.758 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey. Why isn't Kagura here?

00:12:37.891 --> 00:12:39.226 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:40.894 position:16% line:83% align:start
She always takes her time
changing her clothes.

00:12:41.028 --> 00:12:42.830 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Speaking of Kagura,

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:44.865 position:13% line:89% align:start
she always has that camera.

00:12:44.999 --> 00:12:46.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
What does she do with it,
anyway?

00:12:47.001 --> 00:12:49.036 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Take dirty pictures?

00:12:49.303 --> 00:12:52.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm kind of curious why she came
to our temple, aren't you?

00:12:52.306 --> 00:12:55.242 position:10% line:83% align:start
It is our policy not to pry,
after all.

00:12:56.043 --> 00:12:58.045 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
For years, everywhere I've gone,

00:12:58.178 --> 00:12:59.847 position:19% line:89% align:start
she's been by my side.

00:13:00.281 --> 00:13:02.449 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've known her
since grade school.

00:13:03.217 --> 00:13:06.688 position:10% line:83% align:start
When I had no other friends,
and everyone avoided me.

00:13:07.288 --> 00:13:10.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
When I ran away from home
after a fight with my parents.

00:13:11.392 --> 00:13:15.062 position:16% line:83% align:start
And when I came to Japan,
she was always with me.

00:13:15.195 --> 00:13:16.598 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's right.

00:13:16.731 --> 00:13:19.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'd forgotten how quiet
you were at first.

00:13:19.701 --> 00:13:21.536 position:5% line:89% align:start
That's because I was so nervous.

00:13:21.670 --> 00:13:23.804 position:19% line:83% align:start
These days, you're more
talkative than she is.

00:13:23.937 --> 00:13:26.940 position:13% line:83% align:start
She sure doesn't volunteer
much information about herself.

00:13:27.074 --> 00:13:28.576 position:24% line:89% align:start
That, I've noticed.

00:13:29.076 --> 00:13:31.145 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
It's true. She's mysterious.

00:13:31.278 --> 00:13:33.814 position:33% line:83% align:start
There's a lot
even I don't know about her.

00:13:33.947 --> 00:13:36.283 position:10% line:89% align:start
And yet, one thing I do know,

00:13:36.417 --> 00:13:39.420 position:13% line:83% align:start
is that Kagura would never
betray me, no matter what.

00:13:39.554 --> 00:13:42.590 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Because she's my best friend!

00:13:42.724 --> 00:13:44.191 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:13:44.325 --> 00:13:45.593 position:35% line:89% align:start

[chuckles]

00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:49.396 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Mia, that was beautiful.

00:13:49.531 --> 00:13:52.933 position:13% line:83% align:start
But what is everyone doing
in my personal bath?

00:13:53.568 --> 00:13:56.236 position:24% line:83% align:start
I was so surprised
that I instinctively hid,

00:13:56.370 --> 00:13:57.938 position:27% line:83% align:start
and now it seems
like I'm peeping!

00:13:58.072 --> 00:13:59.641 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's more,

00:13:59.774 --> 00:14:02.409 position:10% line:83% align:start
there's no way I can come out
of hiding in this condition!

00:14:02.843 --> 00:14:05.412 position:13% line:89% align:start
Kiki, am I attractive, too?

00:14:05.547 --> 00:14:06.815 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah. Sure.

00:14:07.214 --> 00:14:09.718 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] I have to escape
without being noticed.

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.418 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hmm...

00:14:12.853 --> 00:14:13.788 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:14:13.921 --> 00:14:15.523 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I was noticed!

00:14:15.657 --> 00:14:17.191 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Hmm.

00:14:17.324 --> 00:14:18.392 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
It's over.

-[AKAGAMI crying]

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:21.929 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hey.

00:14:22.062 --> 00:14:23.698 position:30% line:89% align:start
Sorry I'm late.

00:14:23.832 --> 00:14:25.065 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH giggle]

00:14:25.199 --> 00:14:26.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Kagura, are you

00:14:26.668 --> 00:14:28.536 position:16% line:89% align:start
letting me off the hook?

00:14:28.670 --> 00:14:30.538 position:30% line:89% align:start
What an angel.

00:14:30.672 --> 00:14:32.206 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm outta here.

00:14:32.339 --> 00:14:34.074 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Quick question.

00:14:34.308 --> 00:14:36.143 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hypothetically,
what would you all do

00:14:36.276 --> 00:14:38.680 position:16% line:83% align:start
-if Akagami peeped on us?
-[AKAGAMI gasps]

00:14:38.879 --> 00:14:40.247 position:5% line:89% align:start
Turnabout is fair play, so I'd--

00:14:40.381 --> 00:14:41.549 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI, TSUKUYO]
I'd kill him.

00:14:41.683 --> 00:14:42.483 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:14:42.617 --> 00:14:43.984 position:27% line:89% align:start
That makes sense.

00:14:44.118 --> 00:14:45.587 position:19% line:89% align:start
Not only is it a crime,

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.921 position:19% line:83% align:start
-but a moral failing...
-[AKAGAMI groans]

00:14:48.055 --> 00:14:50.692 position:27% line:83% align:start
...and a complete
and utter betrayal of our trust.

00:14:50.825 --> 00:14:52.092 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:14:52.226 --> 00:14:54.161 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why, he'd have to be
evicted immediately.

00:14:54.395 --> 00:14:57.064 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I wish I could disagree!

00:14:57.197 --> 00:15:00.668 position:24% line:83% align:start
Although, I'd want
to at least hear him out first.

00:15:00.802 --> 00:15:01.870 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:15:02.202 --> 00:15:03.872 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, it's Akagami.

00:15:04.004 --> 00:15:05.673 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure there'd be
some explanation.

00:15:05.807 --> 00:15:07.307 position:30% line:89% align:start
Oh, absolutely!

00:15:07.441 --> 00:15:10.344 position:7% line:83% align:start
You just haven't gotten to know
him like we have, Kagura.

00:15:10.612 --> 00:15:11.646 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:13.247 position:33% line:89% align:start
But even so,

00:15:13.380 --> 00:15:15.449 position:7% line:83% align:start
what an embarrassing situation,
right?

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:18.252 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Akemitsu Akagami,
you're such a fool!

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
Listen to how much faith
they have in you

00:15:20.421 --> 00:15:21.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
as a man of high character!

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:23.658 position:19% line:83% align:start
How could you have ever
doubted them?

00:15:23.792 --> 00:15:24.859 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:15:24.992 --> 00:15:26.561 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll announce my presence.

00:15:26.694 --> 00:15:28.262 position:13% line:89% align:start
Surely they'll understand.

00:15:28.395 --> 00:15:30.598 position:19% line:89% align:start
Goodness, I had no idea

00:15:30.732 --> 00:15:33.768 position:24% line:83% align:start
all of you had such
special feelings for Akagami.

00:15:33.902 --> 00:15:35.936 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, uh.
I wouldn't say "special."

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:38.005 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's true.
We've been through a lot.

00:15:38.138 --> 00:15:39.173 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, special!

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:40.675 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Isn't that something?

00:15:40.809 --> 00:15:42.644 position:19% line:89% align:start

Huh? [screams]

00:15:55.022 --> 00:15:58.025 position:13% line:83% align:start
At the year's end, they say
seeing a turtle is good luck.

00:15:58.158 --> 00:15:59.960 position:41% line:89% align:start
Turtle?

00:16:01.596 --> 00:16:05.132 position:38% line:83% align:start
So it was
all a misunderstanding?

00:16:05.633 --> 00:16:06.835 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right.

00:16:06.967 --> 00:16:09.537 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Yet you were hiding
for quite some time.

00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:10.905 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:16:11.038 --> 00:16:12.707 position:21% line:89% align:start
Give the kid a break.

00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:14.709 position:10% line:89% align:start
He did reveal himself, right?

00:16:15.175 --> 00:16:16.443 position:41% line:89% align:start
He did.

00:16:16.578 --> 00:16:18.412 position:33% line:83% align:start
And I agree,
that was commendable, but--

00:16:18.546 --> 00:16:19.714 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:16:20.347 --> 00:16:23.283 position:7% line:89% align:start
No "buts." It was commendable.

00:16:23.417 --> 00:16:25.820 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] And more substantial
than last time.

00:16:25.954 --> 00:16:27.988 position:19% line:89% align:start
And very, I don't know.

-Manly.
-[AKAGAMI] Uh. Thanks.

We're not spending the night?

00:16:34.762 --> 00:16:36.931 position:13% line:83% align:start

the temple empty that long.

I'm going to stay behind.

Uh, no thanks.

I reserved the whole inn,

set you up in the hot spring,

Why would you do that?

Huh?

00:18:27.041 --> 00:18:29.077 position:19% line:89% align:start
My goal here, Akagami,

00:18:29.209 --> 00:18:31.846 position:30% line:83% align:start
is to make you
leave the temple.

in the way of it.

Grand plan?

00:18:37.685 --> 00:18:40.153 position:30% line:83% align:start
My true purpose
in coming to Japan.

00:18:40.287 --> 00:18:42.189 position:19% line:89% align:start
A simple plan, really,

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.224 position:13% line:89% align:start
to awaken an erotic queen.

00:18:44.826 --> 00:18:48.495 position:27% line:83% align:start
The idea was that
during Mia's time here Japan,

00:18:49.097 --> 00:18:50.865 position:7% line:89% align:start
she'd enjoy sexual intercourse

00:18:50.999 --> 00:18:54.167 position:10% line:83% align:start
with no fewer than 100 ready,
willing, and able men.

Mia is the rightful heir

00:19:01.509 --> 00:19:03.911 position:16% line:83% align:start
who will lead that great,
erotic family to glory.

00:19:04.045 --> 00:19:05.412 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yoo-hoo! Kagura!

00:19:05.546 --> 00:19:07.715 position:16% line:89% align:start
How rude. I was speaking.

00:19:07.849 --> 00:19:10.918 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah, sorry, but you were
seriously losing me.

00:19:11.418 --> 00:19:12.687 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
I had every reason

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:14.789 position:24% line:83% align:start
to believe my plan
would go swimmingly.

00:19:14.922 --> 00:19:16.189 position:33% line:89% align:start
But instead,

00:19:16.323 --> 00:19:18.059 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mia bonded with you

00:19:18.191 --> 00:19:19.359 position:16% line:89% align:start
over your shared interest

00:19:19.493 --> 00:19:21.529 position:30% line:83% align:start
in suppressing
your carnal natures.

00:19:21.663 --> 00:19:23.631 position:7% line:89% align:start
Mia wants to escape her family!

00:19:23.765 --> 00:19:26.199 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's the whole reason
she came to Japan!

00:19:26.433 --> 00:19:28.002 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yes, I'm well aware.

00:19:28.136 --> 00:19:29.671 position:16% line:89% align:start
So what are you thinking?

00:19:29.804 --> 00:19:31.204 position:27% line:89% align:start
Isn't it obvious?

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:34.207 position:24% line:83% align:start

my intentions might be?

Why do you work at the temple?

a lot of money.
