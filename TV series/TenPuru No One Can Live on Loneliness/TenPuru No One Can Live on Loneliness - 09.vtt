[sighs]
Hm...

00:00:16.518 --> 00:00:17.317 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.087 position:27% line:83% align:start
You don't have to
do a single thing but leave.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.623 position:35% line:89% align:start
You do that

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:23.958 position:33% line:83% align:start
and you will
have rescued Mikazuki Temple.

[chanting in Japanese]

00:00:27.729 --> 00:00:28.763 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

[chanting continues]

00:02:05.192 --> 00:02:06.561 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Okay!

00:02:08.228 --> 00:02:10.932 position:13% line:83% align:start
So this temple pounds mochi
at the end of the year, huh?

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.835 position:10% line:83% align:start
It's our way of saying thanks
to all our supporters.

00:02:14.434 --> 00:02:15.837 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Now, let's get started!

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.471 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all gasp]

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:19.007 position:10% line:89% align:start
[YUZUKI] We should split up.

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:20.307 position:27% line:83% align:start
Two groups can do
more than one!

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.909 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO, MIA, KURAGE]
Yeah!

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.778 position:24% line:83% align:start
Well, in that case
I'll team up with

00:02:23.911 --> 00:02:25.178 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tsukuyo and Kurage.

00:02:25.312 --> 00:02:26.146 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:27.682 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:02:27.815 --> 00:02:31.418 position:5% line:83% align:start
Hm. This is part of my training.
I can't mess around!

00:02:32.285 --> 00:02:33.755 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey. You know
what I'm thinking?

00:02:33.888 --> 00:02:35.155 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hm?

00:02:35.288 --> 00:02:37.725 position:19% line:83% align:start
Doesn't pounding mochi
seem pretty dirty?

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:40.728 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why'd you have to
take it that way?

00:02:40.862 --> 00:02:42.697 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's just a traditional
activity!

00:02:42.964 --> 00:02:45.566 position:13% line:83% align:start
But you do know why people
pound mochi, don't you?

00:02:45.767 --> 00:02:49.169 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a fertility thing.
That's not autatically dirty.

00:02:49.302 --> 00:02:50.972 position:35% line:83% align:start
You've got
quite an active imagination.

00:02:51.105 --> 00:02:53.173 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] The mallet
represents your manhood

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:55.442 position:30% line:83% align:start
and the mortar
represents the woman.

00:02:55.743 --> 00:02:58.746 position:16% line:83% align:start
Then you take them both.
Slappy, slappy.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.814 position:24% line:89% align:start
Kurage, cut it out!

00:02:59.947 --> 00:03:01.783 position:24% line:83% align:start
Stop making us all
uncomfortable!

00:03:01.916 --> 00:03:03.117 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.086 position:33% line:83% align:start
That in mind,
wanna trade positions?

00:03:05.352 --> 00:03:06.621 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:03:06.954 --> 00:03:09.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
But these positions
aren't how it works.

00:03:09.157 --> 00:03:11.224 position:13% line:89% align:start
Would you lay off, already?

00:03:11.358 --> 00:03:13.695 position:13% line:83% align:start
Don't lose your composure,
Akemitsu Akagami.

00:03:13.828 --> 00:03:16.597 position:13% line:83% align:start
Focus all of your attention
on the mochi in front of you.

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:19.667 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right, let's go.
[grunts]

00:03:19.801 --> 00:03:20.768 position:44% line:89% align:start
Ahh!

00:03:20.902 --> 00:03:23.871 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Ready, and down!
-[KURAGE] Slappy, boing!

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.174 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[grunting]
-[KURAGE] Slappy, boing!

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:27.775 position:19% line:89% align:start
[KURAGE] Slappy, boing!

00:03:27.942 --> 00:03:30.578 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm? Mm.

00:03:30.712 --> 00:03:32.747 position:35% line:83% align:start
You have to
knead the mochi, Akagami.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.082 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ahh! My bad!

00:03:34.214 --> 00:03:36.483 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm kinda confused
on what I'm supposed to knead!

00:03:36.617 --> 00:03:39.587 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Really? Should we
switch back, then?

00:03:40.688 --> 00:03:42.890 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mochi and breasts
are nothing like each other.

00:03:43.024 --> 00:03:44.424 position:21% line:89% align:start
Get it together, man!

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.128 position:35% line:83% align:start
This time,
I won't get distracted.

00:03:47.662 --> 00:03:49.097 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Akagami.
-Huh?

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
Look at those three
plump and delicious mochi. Hm.

00:03:52.466 --> 00:03:54.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? Three of them?

00:03:58.773 --> 00:04:01.609 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Be gone, worldly desires!
-Don't go blind!

00:04:01.976 --> 00:04:03.477 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll handle the mochi
from here.

00:04:03.611 --> 00:04:05.445 position:30% line:83% align:start
You need to go
wash out your eyes!

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:06.981 position:27% line:89% align:start
That sounds good.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.717 position:33% line:89% align:start
[tap running]

00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:13.721 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Here.
-I appreciate it. Thank you.

00:04:14.454 --> 00:04:16.423 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've gotta ask,
what possessed you

00:04:16.557 --> 00:04:17.558 position:24% line:89% align:start
to make that joke?

00:04:17.692 --> 00:04:19.193 position:16% line:89% align:start
The one about her boobs?

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:20.595 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, the boob one.

00:04:20.728 --> 00:04:22.063 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought you were
the kind of guy

00:04:22.196 --> 00:04:23.463 position:19% line:89% align:start
who likes those jokes.

00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:25.365 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't get the wrong idea.

00:04:25.499 --> 00:04:27.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
Would you rather
talk about Yuzuki's boobs?

00:04:27.502 --> 00:04:29.070 position:10% line:89% align:start
That wasn't my point at all!

00:04:29.203 --> 00:04:30.972 position:13% line:89% align:start
Or maybe you'd prefer mine?

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:32.140 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:04:32.272 --> 00:04:33.306 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's so funny with that?

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.876 position:33% line:89% align:start
Ah... Anyway.

00:04:35.042 --> 00:04:37.645 position:19% line:83% align:start
I should go see if Mia
and Kagura could use my help.

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.583 position:7% line:89% align:start
I wish I could grow up faster.

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.154 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Huh?
Where did they run off to?

00:04:46.654 --> 00:04:47.989 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Thank you
for your patience!

00:04:48.122 --> 00:04:50.423 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've finished
changing into my uniform.

00:04:50.758 --> 00:04:51.959 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh!
-[MIA] It's traditional

00:04:52.093 --> 00:04:53.326 position:24% line:89% align:start
for pounding mochi!

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.863 position:24% line:83% align:start
Long ago, a rabbit
offered up its own flesh

00:04:55.997 --> 00:04:59.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
to the hungry Buddha and earned
a place on the moon.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:01.969 position:19% line:83% align:start
Through pounding mochi,
we call upon the soul

00:05:02.103 --> 00:05:04.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
of that noble rabbit
and recognize the value

00:05:04.672 --> 00:05:06.607 position:13% line:89% align:start
of the flesh's sustenance.

00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:08.743 position:16% line:89% align:start
So I embody those ideals!

00:05:09.143 --> 00:05:12.213 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's known as Bunny Penance
for pounding mochi.

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:13.815 position:21% line:89% align:start
You can't be serious!

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:16.918 position:10% line:83% align:start
Surely, it's too difficult to
do penance dressed like that?

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
Please, don't stare
so intently at me.

00:05:19.787 --> 00:05:22.056 position:27% line:83% align:start
Feeling your gaze
is embarrassing.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:23.825 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.660 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:05:25.793 --> 00:05:26.961 position:35% line:83% align:start
You need to
change into something else

00:05:27.094 --> 00:05:28.162 position:16% line:89% align:start
before you catch a cold!

00:05:28.296 --> 00:05:29.831 position:24% line:89% align:start
I brought a stove.

00:05:29.964 --> 00:05:32.499 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Oh...
-This feels incredible!

00:05:32.633 --> 00:05:34.467 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] Well, then.
That solves that.

00:05:34.602 --> 00:05:37.404 position:19% line:83% align:start
I couldn't do anything
to stop it!

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:41.776 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Why are we in a haori?

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:44.512 position:16% line:83% align:start
To stay warm and prevent
wardrobe malfunctions.

00:05:44.645 --> 00:05:46.446 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's so warm with you here!

00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:48.616 position:35% line:83% align:start
The heat is
not my biggest concern.

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:50.685 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now, grab her chest
over her clothes

00:05:50.818 --> 00:05:52.653 position:10% line:83% align:start
-to ensure nothing slips out.
-[AKAGAMI] I feel like we've

00:05:52.787 --> 00:05:54.922 position:19% line:83% align:start
strayed from tradition
somewhere along the way!

00:05:55.089 --> 00:05:57.058 position:19% line:83% align:start
From what I'm reading,
this is totally normal

00:05:57.191 --> 00:05:59.527 position:30% line:83% align:start
when performing
the Shared Haori Penance.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is making me horny,
but let's try, Akagami!

00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:05.967 position:38% line:83% align:start
[groans]
If it's our only choice.

00:06:06.634 --> 00:06:08.202 position:10% line:89% align:start
Wow, where'd this come from?

00:06:08.336 --> 00:06:11.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
I can't grab the mallet,
and I won't grab Mia's boobs!

00:06:11.672 --> 00:06:15.009 position:21% line:83% align:start
So I'll lift Mia up,
and then pound!

00:06:16.443 --> 00:06:18.546 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[AKAGAMI] Lift Mia up, pound!
-Ahh!

00:06:19.379 --> 00:06:21.315 position:10% line:89% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Lift Mia up, pound!

00:06:21.682 --> 00:06:24.051 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Lift Mia up, pound!
-[Mia groans]

00:06:24.484 --> 00:06:25.720 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes! It's working!

00:06:25.920 --> 00:06:27.855 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Lift Mia up, pound!
-[Mia groans]

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:31.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
This method is great!
We're making serious... Huh!

00:06:31.458 --> 00:06:33.060 position:21% line:83% align:start
Akagami's holding me
from behind

00:06:33.194 --> 00:06:34.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
in his big, sexy arms.

00:06:34.595 --> 00:06:36.864 position:19% line:83% align:start
And now I'm starting to
feel a little..

00:06:38.633 --> 00:06:40.201 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, no!
We should take a break.

00:06:40.334 --> 00:06:42.536 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Do you need me to
take care of this batch, too?

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:44.372 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, Tsukuyo! Uh...

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:46.374 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're a bunny girl too?

00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:48.576 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
you'd blackmail me

00:06:48.709 --> 00:06:51.478 position:19% line:83% align:start
by threatening to talk
about our kiss, you monster.

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:54.215 position:16% line:83% align:start
I don't remember anything
of the sort!

00:06:54.382 --> 00:06:55.716 position:16% line:89% align:start
I didn't say that, right?

00:06:55.850 --> 00:06:57.051 position:16% line:83% align:start
-C'mon, tell me I didn't.
-[KURAGE] Hey, I have

00:06:57.184 --> 00:06:58.753 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I wouldn't..
-[KURAGE] a question.

00:06:58.886 --> 00:07:00.821 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why isn't anyone else
dressed up like this?

00:07:00.955 --> 00:07:02.123 position:35% line:89% align:start
[exclaims]

00:07:02.356 --> 00:07:03.658 position:38% line:83% align:start

-[KURAGE] Why just me?

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:05.425 position:24% line:89% align:start
[KURAGE] Well? Why?

00:07:05.559 --> 00:07:07.460 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] This is getting
too dangerous.

00:07:07.728 --> 00:07:10.331 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm about to lose the fight
against worldly desires.

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:12.099 position:38% line:83% align:start
What am I
supposed to do?

00:07:12.233 --> 00:07:14.201 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Hey, Akagami.
What's happening?

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.237 position:30% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Yuzuki!

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:19.307 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] I was only gone
a few minutes, so...

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:21.275 position:38% line:83% align:start
I swear,
it's not what it looks like!

00:07:21.409 --> 00:07:22.843 position:16% line:89% align:start
This isn't because of me!

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:25.212 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Then why is Mia
dressed up like that?

00:07:25.346 --> 00:07:27.581 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not to mention
those two.

00:07:28.582 --> 00:07:30.718 position:24% line:83% align:start
Here's your chance
to explain this away.

00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:33.254 position:33% line:83% align:start
Please, stop.
Your grip, it hurts!

00:07:35.523 --> 00:07:38.491 position:10% line:83% align:start
Penance? What kind of penance
is this?

00:07:38.793 --> 00:07:39.961 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've never heard of a penance

00:07:40.094 --> 00:07:41.629 position:21% line:83% align:start
that makes you dress
like a bunny.

00:07:41.762 --> 00:07:43.097 position:38% line:83% align:start
You know,
I'm starting to suspect

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:45.933 position:19% line:83% align:start
the Complete Collection
of Penances is fake.

00:07:47.234 --> 00:07:50.204 position:33% line:83% align:start
So that's it.
She still wants me kicked out.

00:07:55.576 --> 00:07:56.844 position:13% line:89% align:start
[AKAGAMI] I hope you enjoy!

00:07:56.978 --> 00:07:59.280 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[gasping]
-Vegetable miso soup!

00:07:59.413 --> 00:08:00.881 position:7% line:89% align:start
Since it's been chilly outside

00:08:01.015 --> 00:08:03.351 position:10% line:83% align:start
I figured I'd make something
to help warm us all up.

00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:06.554 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Thank you.
-It's so good.

00:08:06.721 --> 00:08:09.056 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hold on. Where's Kiki?

00:08:09.357 --> 00:08:10.725 position:24% line:89% align:start
Maybe in her room?

00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:13.761 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course!
Well, I'll bring her some.

00:08:14.195 --> 00:08:16.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Thanks.
She'll appreciate that!

00:08:16.697 --> 00:08:18.099 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[MIA] Have you heard?
-Huh?

00:08:18.232 --> 00:08:20.267 position:19% line:83% align:start
Miso soup was invented
by a guy named Mister Miso

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:22.670 position:10% line:83% align:start
who served the dish to a monk
named Mister Soup.

00:08:22.803 --> 00:08:25.673 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MIA] And he decided to give it
his last name!

00:08:28.609 --> 00:08:29.844 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Kiki.
-Huh?

00:08:30.111 --> 00:08:32.146 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Oh, it's just you.

00:08:32.346 --> 00:08:34.615 position:19% line:83% align:start
What are you doing here
when it's so cold out?

00:08:34.782 --> 00:08:37.885 position:7% line:83% align:start
I ought to be asking you that.
I brought dinner.

00:08:38.019 --> 00:08:40.321 position:35% line:83% align:start
Thank you.
I was starving.

00:08:40.454 --> 00:08:41.722 position:10% line:89% align:start
Care to have a drink with me?

00:08:41.856 --> 00:08:44.692 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Oh, um,
if you don't mind.

00:08:45.893 --> 00:08:47.762 position:30% line:89% align:start
[sips, exhales]

00:08:48.095 --> 00:08:49.864 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm still shocked
we found a man

00:08:49.997 --> 00:08:51.432 position:16% line:89% align:start
who's so good at cooking.

00:08:51.565 --> 00:08:54.201 position:16% line:83% align:start
Why did you come out here
by yourself to have a drink?

00:08:54.335 --> 00:08:55.903 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's not that bad.

00:08:56.037 --> 00:08:58.806 position:7% line:83% align:start
-There's quite a view tonight.
-Oh, yeah?

00:09:04.645 --> 00:09:05.713 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-[sighs]

00:09:05.846 --> 00:09:07.615 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know how to put it away.

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:10.317 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's my first drink
since the mixers.

00:09:12.253 --> 00:09:14.588 position:24% line:83% align:start
The tokudo ceremony
is coming up soon.

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:16.824 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm grateful for your help
with Yuzuki.

00:09:16.957 --> 00:09:18.325 position:21% line:83% align:start
But we still haven't
figured out

00:09:18.459 --> 00:09:21.162 position:27% line:83% align:start
how we can afford
to repair the principal figure.

00:09:21.662 --> 00:09:23.564 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You're right. Hm.
-Uh...

00:09:24.131 --> 00:09:25.933 position:35% line:83% align:start
But once we
get past this problem

00:09:26.067 --> 00:09:27.968 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki will be closer
than she's ever been

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:30.871 position:13% line:83% align:start
to her dream of taking over
at Mikazuki Temple.

00:09:31.172 --> 00:09:32.907 position:21% line:83% align:start
After she's overcome
that hurdle,

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:35.609 position:10% line:83% align:start
she'll just have to discover
this temple's true form.

00:09:35.876 --> 00:09:37.611 position:7% line:89% align:start
What do you mean, "true form?"

00:09:38.079 --> 00:09:40.214 position:33% line:83% align:start
That won't be
where her journey ends.

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.983 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's only the start
of her real adventure.

00:09:45.453 --> 00:09:49.123 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you? What will you do
when the tokudo's finished?

00:09:49.857 --> 00:09:51.892 position:16% line:83% align:start
Will you devote yourself
to working here

00:09:52.026 --> 00:09:53.994 position:19% line:83% align:start
or will you go through
tokudo yourself,

00:09:54.128 --> 00:09:56.597 position:30% line:83% align:start
keep training,
and become a head priest?

00:09:56.897 --> 00:09:59.266 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki will become
the head priest here.

00:09:59.568 --> 00:10:00.734 position:19% line:89% align:start
After that's happened,

00:10:00.968 --> 00:10:03.104 position:35% line:83% align:start
this temple
won't need me anymore.

00:10:05.272 --> 00:10:06.073 position:24% line:89% align:start
But knowing Yuzuki,

00:10:06.207 --> 00:10:07.875 position:7% line:89% align:start
I suspect she'd feel encouraged

00:10:08.008 --> 00:10:10.111 position:13% line:83% align:start
if someone like you decided
to place their roots down

00:10:10.244 --> 00:10:12.480 position:24% line:83% align:start
-and stay with her.
-Hm.

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.816 position:10% line:83% align:start
After all, who wouldn't want
a man like you around?

00:10:16.016 --> 00:10:17.718 position:30% line:83% align:start
I wish I could
take you with me!

00:10:17.852 --> 00:10:19.554 position:30% line:83% align:start
The two of us,
running a temple?

00:10:19.787 --> 00:10:22.890 position:7% line:83% align:start
Well, I'm sure every day would
be an interesting adventure.

00:10:23.090 --> 00:10:25.626 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then how about you come
and work for me?

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.028 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm sure I could
make it worth your while.

00:10:28.162 --> 00:10:29.897 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You know, if you serve me...
-Huh!

00:10:30.030 --> 00:10:32.833 position:10% line:89% align:start
I have some services for you.

00:10:33.067 --> 00:10:35.836 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Wait. Are you drunk, Kiki?
-[Kiki laughs]

Disguises. Can't be too safe
in enemy territory.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.487 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] What a violent way
to think!

00:11:26.621 --> 00:11:28.523 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know temples and shrines
have had something

00:11:28.657 --> 00:11:29.823 position:16% line:89% align:start
of a tumultuous history,

00:11:29.957 --> 00:11:32.092 position:21% line:83% align:start
but we all get along
just fine now.

00:11:32.493 --> 00:11:33.727 position:21% line:89% align:start
There was even a time

00:11:33.861 --> 00:11:35.129 position:35% line:83% align:start
when we had
Shinto-Buddhist syncretism

00:11:35.262 --> 00:11:37.464 position:16% line:83% align:start
with no real distinction
between our beliefs.

00:11:37.731 --> 00:11:38.933 position:44% line:89% align:start
Wow.

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:41.468 position:13% line:83% align:start

always worrying.

00:11:41.603 --> 00:11:43.103 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

You good?

00:11:50.344 --> 00:11:51.680 position:24% line:83% align:start
I thought you might
have something to say

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.515 position:27% line:83% align:start
about how I look
in my long sleeves.

00:11:53.648 --> 00:11:55.082 position:19% line:89% align:start
Oh, of course! My bad!

It's not like
I need it personally.

00:11:57.418 --> 00:11:59.220 position:10% line:83% align:start

Uh-uh-uh, that won't do.

00:12:25.913 --> 00:12:27.348 position:21% line:83% align:start
You should complement
a grown woman

by telling her
how beautiful she's looking.

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:50.605 position:24% line:83% align:start
You flip this thing
upside-down

00:12:50.739 --> 00:12:52.574 position:16% line:83% align:start
and the number that comes
out of the hole down here

00:12:52.707 --> 00:12:53.841 position:27% line:89% align:start
is your fortune.

00:12:53.974 --> 00:12:56.377 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh! Thanks for the help!

00:12:56.877 --> 00:12:59.413 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, yeah! You're dressed
beautifully today!

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:03.685 position:13% line:83% align:start
I guess kimonos are pretty
beautiful, aren't they?

00:13:04.051 --> 00:13:05.886 position:24% line:83% align:start
That's not exactly
what I meant.

00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.723 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Was that about me,
or about how I'm dressed?

00:13:09.223 --> 00:13:11.660 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] You. I'm learning
how to compliment women.

00:13:11.792 --> 00:13:13.561 position:10% line:89% align:start
But I seem to be struggling.

00:13:13.762 --> 00:13:14.629 position:27% line:89% align:start
Don't over-think!

00:13:14.763 --> 00:13:16.230 position:27% line:89% align:start
Just be up front

00:13:16.363 --> 00:13:18.633 position:16% line:83% align:start
and tell her exactly what
you find attractive about her!

00:13:18.999 --> 00:13:20.769 position:13% line:89% align:start
Like what? Any suggestions?

00:13:20.901 --> 00:13:22.537 position:21% line:89% align:start
[MIA] I've got a few.

00:13:25.372 --> 00:13:27.975 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yawning]

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:30.177 position:10% line:83% align:start
-[YUZUKI] Ah! There you are!
-Huh?

00:13:34.214 --> 00:13:35.816 position:19% line:89% align:start
How are you holding up?

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:37.519 position:44% line:89% align:start
Uh...

00:13:37.951 --> 00:13:39.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
-You're beautiful.
-Huh?

00:13:39.654 --> 00:13:41.855 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, that's so nice.

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:43.457 position:30% line:89% align:start
That's not it!

00:13:43.692 --> 00:13:45.459 position:33% line:83% align:start
Mia taught me
some better things to say.

00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:48.362 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, girl! Let's smash,
or something!

00:13:48.630 --> 00:13:50.665 position:21% line:83% align:start
I wish you'd stuck to
your first line!

00:13:51.298 --> 00:13:52.466 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[AKAGAMI] Anyway.
-[indistinct chatter]

00:13:52.600 --> 00:13:53.934 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I'm glad they're having fun.

00:13:54.201 --> 00:13:56.270 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's been a while
since we visited a shrine.

00:13:56.571 --> 00:13:58.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Did you not wanna go?
-We just couldn't

00:13:59.006 --> 00:14:00.174 position:24% line:83% align:start
because all of our
end-of-year work

00:14:00.307 --> 00:14:02.376 position:27% line:83% align:start
rolled right into
New Year's celebrations.

00:14:02.510 --> 00:14:03.712 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:04.078 --> 00:14:05.814 position:27% line:83% align:start
But now, I wanna
come back each year

00:14:05.946 --> 00:14:07.381 position:30% line:89% align:start
with everyone.

00:14:07.749 --> 00:14:09.483 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't you? [giggles]

00:14:09.983 --> 00:14:11.151 position:44% line:89% align:start
I do.

00:14:14.254 --> 00:14:16.056 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] If I decided
to move out

00:14:16.223 --> 00:14:18.425 position:30% line:83% align:start
it would solve
all their money problems.

00:14:19.126 --> 00:14:20.662 position:7% line:89% align:start
[YUZUKI] I'll take care of it.

00:14:21.261 --> 00:14:22.831 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll handle everything.

00:14:23.063 --> 00:14:24.865 position:16% line:83% align:start
Mikazuki Temple is where
we all belong

00:14:24.998 --> 00:14:26.534 position:21% line:89% align:start
and I'll protect it.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.369 position:27% line:89% align:start
I know you will.

00:14:28.869 --> 00:14:30.037 position:7% line:89% align:start
During my matchmaking meeting,

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:31.539 position:24% line:83% align:start
everything ended up
the way I wanted

00:14:31.673 --> 00:14:34.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
because I refused to give up
no matter what.

00:14:35.275 --> 00:14:36.711 position:19% line:89% align:start
[AKAGAMI] That's right.

00:14:36.845 --> 00:14:39.380 position:21% line:89% align:start
I promised. I swore.

00:14:40.682 --> 00:14:42.149 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will support her.

00:14:43.518 --> 00:14:45.787 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:45.953 --> 00:14:47.689 position:33% line:89% align:start
[YUZUKI] Hm?

00:14:47.822 --> 00:14:49.624 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on!
Where are you going?

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.598 position:16% line:83% align:start
I will ensure Mia awakens
as an erotic queen.

00:14:56.897 --> 00:14:58.198 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's my duty.

00:14:59.266 --> 00:15:00.934 position:21% line:83% align:start
I figured it would be
a simple task

00:15:01.068 --> 00:15:02.970 position:7% line:89% align:start
that wouldn't take any effort.

00:15:04.706 --> 00:15:07.675 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YOUNG KAGURA] I know you!
Isn't your name Mia Christoph?

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:09.376 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:15:09.511 --> 00:15:10.678 position:27% line:89% align:start
Nice to meet you.

00:15:10.812 --> 00:15:13.147 position:7% line:89% align:start
You may call me Kagura Baldwin.

00:15:14.415 --> 00:15:17.451 position:19% line:83% align:start
I thought the two of us
could get along swimmingly.

00:15:17.585 --> 00:15:19.052 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:15:19.554 --> 00:15:21.054 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] But I was caught
off-guard.

00:15:21.188 --> 00:15:23.490 position:41% line:83% align:start
She was
a rebellious child!

00:15:24.224 --> 00:15:26.594 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm banning all eroticism,
Kagura!

00:15:26.828 --> 00:15:28.061 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:15:28.195 --> 00:15:30.532 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've got a non-erotic plan
to run away!

00:15:30.665 --> 00:15:31.666 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh?

00:15:32.232 --> 00:15:34.001 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll write music
to teach the world

00:15:34.134 --> 00:15:35.936 position:16% line:89% align:start
about my anti-eroticism!

00:15:36.069 --> 00:15:37.906 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-I even made lyrics!

00:15:38.038 --> 00:15:39.841 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[YOUNG KAGURA] She's bizarre.
-âª Na-na-na not erotic âª

00:15:39.973 --> 00:15:42.911 position:7% line:83% align:start
Why is she so intent on defying
her family's beliefs?

00:15:43.043 --> 00:15:45.245 position:13% line:83% align:start
-No, I need one fewer "na."
-She should do as they say.

00:15:45.379 --> 00:15:47.916 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YOUNG KAGURA] Life is easier
if you fall in line.

00:15:48.048 --> 00:15:50.217 position:16% line:89% align:start
âª Na-na-na not erotic! âª

00:15:51.586 --> 00:15:53.387 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIA'S MOTHER] You would
send her to Japan?

00:15:53.521 --> 00:15:54.789 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:15:54.923 --> 00:15:56.957 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MIA'S MOTHER] And what benefit
would that serve us?

00:15:57.391 --> 00:15:59.393 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] I've tried various
methods to guide her

00:15:59.527 --> 00:16:01.161 position:10% line:89% align:start
in becoming an erotic queen,

00:16:01.295 --> 00:16:04.097 position:16% line:83% align:start
but it seems that reason
always finds a way to win out.

00:16:04.331 --> 00:16:06.901 position:27% line:83% align:start
She is determined
to suppress her nature.

00:16:07.234 --> 00:16:08.503 position:5% line:89% align:start
[MIA'S MOTHER] It would seem so.

00:16:08.837 --> 00:16:11.472 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] So I propose
we resort to chastity.

00:16:11.639 --> 00:16:14.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
If we show Mia
how painfully drab her life is

00:16:14.374 --> 00:16:16.644 position:13% line:83% align:start
at a nunnery, it may stoke
the fires within her

00:16:16.778 --> 00:16:19.213 position:21% line:83% align:start
and make her seek out
the touch of a man.

00:16:19.747 --> 00:16:22.917 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MIA'S MOTHER] I follow you.
It's reverse psychology.

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:25.018 position:24% line:89% align:start
Then I'll allow it.

00:16:25.385 --> 00:16:28.188 position:35% line:83% align:start
That said,
you must oversee her

00:16:28.322 --> 00:16:30.592 position:35% line:83% align:start
and ensure
she has sexual intercourse

00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:31.992 position:33% line:89% align:start
with 100 men.

00:16:32.493 --> 00:16:34.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
You will capture
her conquests on this

00:16:34.696 --> 00:16:37.799 position:27% line:83% align:start
and report back,
sending news every three days.

00:16:38.165 --> 00:16:39.667 position:19% line:83% align:start
I expect to see results
from you.

00:16:39.868 --> 00:16:42.604 position:35% line:83% align:start
Otherwise,
you will be made to return.

00:16:43.170 --> 00:16:44.639 position:24% line:89% align:start
Certainly, madame.

00:16:48.475 --> 00:16:50.845 position:21% line:83% align:start
-May I ask something?
-Hm?

00:16:51.846 --> 00:16:53.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIA'S MOTHER] You haven't
become attached to her

00:16:53.815 --> 00:16:56.651 position:30% line:83% align:start
and compromised
your work ethic have you?

00:16:56.784 --> 00:16:58.285 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:16:58.418 --> 00:17:00.153 position:19% line:89% align:start
Like that could happen.

00:17:02.422 --> 00:17:04.424 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] At first,
it was impossible

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:07.795 position:30% line:83% align:start
to send photos
every three days as she wanted.

00:17:10.097 --> 00:17:13.033 position:7% line:83% align:start
This will have to be sufficient
for the time being.

00:17:13.868 --> 00:17:16.638 position:33% line:83% align:start
Which is when
that man first arrived.

00:17:16.938 --> 00:17:18.907 position:24% line:83% align:start
I set Mia's sights
on him

00:17:19.039 --> 00:17:22.610 position:27% line:83% align:start
and got some good
material to use in my collages.

00:17:22.977 --> 00:17:24.779 position:19% line:89% align:start
Now, things are easier.

00:17:24.913 --> 00:17:26.781 position:10% line:89% align:start
Despite her stubborn nature,

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:29.349 position:7% line:89% align:start
it seems Mia is more cheerful.

00:17:29.651 --> 00:17:30.718 position:38% line:89% align:start

-Although...
-[both chuckling]

00:17:34.022 --> 00:17:36.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
has she genuinely

00:17:36.456 --> 00:17:38.560 position:7% line:83% align:start
-No, Mia. Friendship or lust...
-Do you wanna practice?

00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:40.762 position:19% line:83% align:start
-...is already enough.
-Sure!

00:17:41.629 --> 00:17:44.064 position:30% line:83% align:start
Falling in love
is strictly forbidden!

[footsteps approaching]

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:49.169 position:27% line:83% align:start
Have you finally
reached an answer, Akagami?

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.172 position:10% line:89% align:start
After careful consideration,

00:17:52.306 --> 00:17:54.542 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think it's best for me
to move away.

00:17:54.676 --> 00:17:55.743 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:17:55.877 --> 00:17:57.277 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] The temple could
use the money

00:17:57.411 --> 00:17:58.980 position:16% line:89% align:start
and I know I could, too.

00:17:59.112 --> 00:18:01.114 position:33% line:83% align:start
We've reached
the same conclusion.

00:18:01.248 --> 00:18:02.617 position:30% line:83% align:start
You've offered
to take on my debt

00:18:02.750 --> 00:18:04.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
and help repair
the principal figure.

00:18:04.886 --> 00:18:07.956 position:7% line:83% align:start
An offer like that comes around
once in a lifetime.

00:18:08.088 --> 00:18:09.857 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're right, of course.

00:18:10.123 --> 00:18:12.527 position:27% line:83% align:start
The man Mia loves
will disappear,

00:18:13.226 --> 00:18:14.394 position:35% line:89% align:start
as he must.

00:18:14.963 --> 00:18:17.464 position:13% line:83% align:start
The money will be all yours
when you move out.

-[Akagami sighs]
-Huh!

00:18:19.099 --> 00:18:20.935 position:13% line:89% align:start
Unless you have a problem.

00:18:21.569 --> 00:18:24.772 position:19% line:83% align:start
I do think it would be
for the best. Believe me.

00:18:26.074 --> 00:18:28.076 position:7% line:89% align:start
But I decline in spite of that!

00:18:28.475 --> 00:18:30.545 position:44% line:83% align:start
What?
You're refusing an offer

00:18:30.678 --> 00:18:32.479 position:33% line:83% align:start
that benefits
everyone involved?

00:18:32.614 --> 00:18:34.916 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's not just the debt
your father left you,

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:38.519 position:7% line:83% align:start
but the one for kissing Tsukuyo
and repairing those vehicles.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:40.622 position:44% line:83% align:start
Uh...
How do you know about those?

00:18:40.788 --> 00:18:42.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
But more important
than any of that,

00:18:42.690 --> 00:18:45.059 position:13% line:83% align:start
how will you afford to have
the principal figure repaired

00:18:45.192 --> 00:18:46.861 position:7% line:89% align:start
with so little time remaining?

00:18:46.995 --> 00:18:49.864 position:21% line:83% align:start
Do you have any ideas
to get out of this predicament?

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:52.634 position:35% line:83% align:start
Not at all!
We'll figure it out!

00:18:54.167 --> 00:18:55.503 position:27% line:89% align:start
How do you know?

00:18:55.637 --> 00:18:57.872 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've just got a feeling
everything will be fine.

00:18:58.039 --> 00:19:00.708 position:7% line:83% align:start
You need to accept the reality
that being a meathead

00:19:00.842 --> 00:19:02.476 position:33% line:83% align:start
won't resolve
any of the problems

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.411 position:19% line:83% align:start
plaguing the residents
of the temple.

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:06.279 position:7% line:89% align:start
I won't let you insult Yuzuki!

00:19:06.413 --> 00:19:08.382 position:30% line:83% align:start
You think she's
who I'm talking about?

00:19:08.616 --> 00:19:11.953 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll admit that it sounds good,
ending our money problems.

00:19:12.219 --> 00:19:13.821 position:10% line:83% align:start
However, what you've offered
would be

00:19:13.955 --> 00:19:16.356 position:27% line:83% align:start
nothing more than
a temporary solution!

00:19:16.490 --> 00:19:17.792 position:33% line:83% align:start
And you fear
you'll find yourself

00:19:17.925 --> 00:19:20.427 position:16% line:83% align:start
facing the same situation
again, right?

00:19:20.561 --> 00:19:23.430 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yes. And there's something
I cannot forsake.

00:19:23.698 --> 00:19:26.734 position:16% line:83% align:start
I swore that I'd support
Yuzuki no matter what.

00:19:27.401 --> 00:19:30.038 position:27% line:83% align:start
So this can't be
my only option. You know?

00:19:30.170 --> 00:19:32.740 position:13% line:83% align:start
There's gotta be something
better than running!

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
Looks like I won't
convince him.

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:39.580 position:10% line:83% align:start
Understood. You may consider
my offer withdrawn.

00:19:39.881 --> 00:19:43.017 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well. I'm certain
he'll come crawling back to me.

00:19:43.151 --> 00:19:44.484 position:16% line:89% align:start
Raising money isn't easy.

00:19:44.619 --> 00:19:45.887 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Thank goodness.
-Mm.

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.221 position:27% line:83% align:start
This means I can
keep my promise to Mia, too.

00:19:48.355 --> 00:19:49.590 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:49.724 --> 00:19:52.492 position:24% line:83% align:start
We swore that we'd
fight side by side.

00:19:53.127 --> 00:19:55.362 position:41% line:83% align:start
-What?
-I refuse to betray her!

00:19:55.563 --> 00:19:58.331 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] Oh, really?
You won't betray her?

00:19:58.599 --> 00:20:00.134 position:27% line:83% align:start
Who do you think
you are?

00:20:00.434 --> 00:20:01.569 position:33% line:89% align:start
You say that,

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:03.571 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you're in love
with Yuzuki Aoba!

00:20:03.838 --> 00:20:05.573 position:35% line:83% align:start
Mia may not
realize it yet,

00:20:05.707 --> 00:20:07.775 position:30% line:83% align:start
but she's truly
in love with you.

00:20:07.942 --> 00:20:09.309 position:24% line:89% align:start
An unrequited love.

00:20:09.577 --> 00:20:11.913 position:27% line:83% align:start
How will she feel
when she finds out?

00:20:12.146 --> 00:20:13.313 position:30% line:89% align:start
It'll hurt her

00:20:13.447 --> 00:20:15.817 position:27% line:83% align:start
and she may never
learn how to love again!

00:20:16.483 --> 00:20:19.319 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[chuckles]
-Is something wrong?

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.790 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't talk about her!
You don't understand Mia!

00:20:22.924 --> 00:20:24.391 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could you know
what she's feeling?

00:20:24.525 --> 00:20:26.728 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've never seen you
so angry before!

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:28.129 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:20:28.261 --> 00:20:30.363 position:10% line:83% align:start
Ever since I met you, you've
always hid your emotions!

00:20:30.497 --> 00:20:32.499 position:21% line:83% align:start
You think this is me
when I'm angry?

00:20:32.767 --> 00:20:34.669 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've even started
raising your voice at me!

00:20:34.802 --> 00:20:36.738 position:35% line:83% align:start
You'll know
if I raise my voice at you!

00:20:36.871 --> 00:20:39.339 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[laughs]
-What's the big idea?

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:40.908 position:19% line:89% align:start
Frankly, I'm relieved.

00:20:41.042 --> 00:20:43.511 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm happy to see you
get so upset on Mia's behalf.

00:20:43.644 --> 00:20:45.546 position:13% line:89% align:start
I told you, I'm not upset.

00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.749 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's clear to me,
you care for Mia.

00:20:47.882 --> 00:20:49.951 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] And you don't only
care about her family.

00:20:50.084 --> 00:20:51.085 position:38% line:89% align:start
[shocked]

00:20:51.919 --> 00:20:53.788 position:27% line:83% align:start
I knew something
seemed a little off.

00:20:54.354 --> 00:20:57.125 position:7% line:83% align:start
I never believed that you would
just betray her like that.

00:20:57.424 --> 00:20:58.926 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh! What do you mean?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.563 position:7% line:83% align:start
I suppose it's how you two look
when you're sharing a smile.

00:21:02.697 --> 00:21:04.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] You seem
genuinely happy.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:09.137 position:10% line:83% align:start
You did all this because you
care so deeply about Mia.

00:21:09.336 --> 00:21:10.638 position:27% line:83% align:start
You never wanted
to do anything

00:21:10.772 --> 00:21:12.272 position:30% line:83% align:start
that would risk
betraying her trust.

00:21:12.405 --> 00:21:13.608 position:35% line:89% align:start
No, you...

00:21:13.741 --> 00:21:15.910 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's okay!
You don't need to hide it.

00:21:16.043 --> 00:21:19.279 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:21:21.314 --> 00:21:22.617 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:21:23.251 --> 00:21:26.554 position:16% line:83% align:start
How unseemly. I shouldn't
have done that. [spraying]

00:21:26.788 --> 00:21:28.956 position:24% line:83% align:start
I simply hold fast
to my position.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:32.627 position:16% line:83% align:start
By my name as a Baldwin,
I shall see my work complete.

00:21:33.227 --> 00:21:36.197 position:21% line:83% align:start
Honestly! How did you
get any other idea?

00:21:36.463 --> 00:21:39.700 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Akagami gagging]

00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:42.870 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[deep exhale]
-Oh!

00:21:43.771 --> 00:21:46.073 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Kagura!
-Hello, there.

00:21:46.207 --> 00:21:47.842 position:7% line:89% align:start
I thank you for your patience.

00:21:48.042 --> 00:21:49.309 position:19% line:89% align:start
Have you seen Akagami?

00:21:49.442 --> 00:21:51.112 position:7% line:89% align:start
He needed to take a quick nap.

00:21:51.245 --> 00:21:52.479 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:52.613 --> 00:21:54.048 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[YUZUKI] Kagura! Just in time!
-Huh?

00:21:54.414 --> 00:21:56.717 position:7% line:83% align:start
We were all out here trying to
brainstorm different ways

00:21:56.851 --> 00:21:59.520 position:13% line:83% align:start
that Mikazuki Temple could
rally up some quick money.

00:21:59.821 --> 00:22:00.955 position:7% line:83% align:start
-I've been asking for advice...
-Huh.

00:22:01.088 --> 00:22:02.657 position:35% line:83% align:start
but I think
we're kind of stumped!

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.859 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Oh.
-You can count on her.

00:22:04.992 --> 00:22:07.562 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's the most dependable
person on the planet!

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:10.131 position:35% line:83% align:start
After all,
she's my best friend

00:22:10.264 --> 00:22:12.066 position:7% line:89% align:start
and we're like identical twins!

00:22:12.633 --> 00:22:14.135 position:30% line:89% align:start
Right, Kagura?

00:22:14.268 --> 00:22:15.837 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:22:16.537 --> 00:22:17.972 position:33% line:89% align:start
What a mess.

00:22:18.673 --> 00:22:21.008 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] I'm nothing
but a dutiful servant.

00:23:52.967 --> 00:23:54.936 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hear the cackling flames
of love!

00:23:55.069 --> 00:23:56.871 position:21% line:83% align:start
You mean "crackling,"
not "cackling."

00:23:57.004 --> 00:23:59.073 position:13% line:83% align:start
I hear your heart crackling
for Akagami.

00:23:59.206 --> 00:24:00.841 position:35% line:83% align:start
My heart's
not crackling for him!

00:24:00.975 --> 00:24:03.811 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just got, you know,
too turned on.

00:24:03.945 --> 00:24:05.379 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[screams]
-Is that so?

00:24:05.513 --> 00:24:07.447 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why don't you say it
even louder?
