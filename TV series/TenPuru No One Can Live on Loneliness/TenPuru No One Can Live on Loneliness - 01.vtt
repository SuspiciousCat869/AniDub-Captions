who borrowed money
from our temple

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.001 position:13% line:89% align:start
and then disappeared on us!

00:21:40.601 --> 00:21:42.335 position:21% line:89% align:start
Listen up, everyone.

00:21:42.904 --> 00:21:45.940 position:7% line:83% align:start
We can't reasonably expect him
to have that kind of money.

00:21:46.073 --> 00:21:48.142 position:27% line:83% align:start
But we obviously
can't ignore it, either.

00:21:48.375 --> 00:21:51.444 position:10% line:83% align:start
So let's decide on a sensible
method of repayment.

00:21:51.579 --> 00:21:53.346 position:16% line:83% align:start
Raise your hands to vote,
everyone.

00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.448 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Slavery.
-Organs.

00:21:55.583 --> 00:21:56.951 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you ask me,

00:21:57.084 --> 00:21:59.352 position:16% line:83% align:start
the best available option
is to sell his dignity.

00:21:59.486 --> 00:22:00.688 position:19% line:89% align:start
[Nyagosuke agree meow]

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:02.489 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE]
I bet he'd really rake it in.

00:22:02.623 --> 00:22:05.159 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Kurage! What are you saying?

00:22:05.293 --> 00:22:07.327 position:13% line:89% align:start
Anyway. Moving right along.

00:22:07.562 --> 00:22:08.930 position:13% line:89% align:start
After weighing the options,

00:22:09.063 --> 00:22:11.532 position:10% line:83% align:start
we've decided you'll repay us
with your body.

00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:14.836 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kagura smile]

00:22:16.469 --> 00:22:17.939 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Akemitsu shock]

00:22:18.072 --> 00:22:21.642 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Akemitsu scream]

00:23:52.633 --> 00:23:54.168 position:44% line:83% align:start
Okay.
Take off all your clothes.

00:23:54.302 --> 00:23:57.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Wait, what?
-Akagami will do the same.

00:23:57.204 --> 00:23:58.372 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, wait, what?

00:23:58.506 --> 00:23:59.974 position:33% line:83% align:start
Some moisture
should do the trick.

00:24:00.107 --> 00:24:01.876 position:35% line:89% align:start
Wait, what?

00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:05.880 position:21% line:83% align:start
Don't worry about it.
Being pervy isn't a bad thing.
