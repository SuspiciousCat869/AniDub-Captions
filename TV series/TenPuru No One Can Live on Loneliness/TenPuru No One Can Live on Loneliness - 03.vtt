00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.612 position:24% line:89% align:start
Akagami? Listen up!

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:14.114 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki and Tsukuyo
clearly weren't up to the task

00:00:14.248 --> 00:00:15.550 position:30% line:83% align:start
of facing you.
-Hey!

00:00:15.683 --> 00:00:17.652 position:21% line:83% align:start
So, now it's up to me
to save this temple!

00:00:17.785 --> 00:00:20.722 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mia, I'm not sure
you really understand.

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:22.155 position:33% line:89% align:start
Don't worry.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.025 position:16% line:83% align:start
I won't ask him to leave
after I defeat him.

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:26.961 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
No, Akagami.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.029 position:10% line:83% align:start
I have a different punishment
in mind.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.132 position:5% line:89% align:start
Namely, that I'll castrate you.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.835 position:35% line:89% align:start
[all shock]

00:00:33.968 --> 00:00:36.270 position:30% line:89% align:start
You. You will?

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
-What a great idea!
-"Great?" Really?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.401 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Look after things
while I'm gone,

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:16.470 position:24% line:53% align:start
-will you, Akagami?
-[AKEMITSU] Yes, of course!

00:02:16.604 --> 00:02:19.807 position:7% line:83% align:start
-And try to get along with Mia.
-[AKEMITSU] Yes, of course!

00:02:19.941 --> 00:02:22.777 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Um. What's "castrate" mean?
-[surprised]

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.277 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just don't worry about it.

00:02:24.411 --> 00:02:26.246 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[Tsukuyo laugh]
-But if you have to,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.348 position:27% line:83% align:start
then work it out
with your fists!

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.184 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course! [question]

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.661 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[YUZUKI] All right, we're off!
[AKEMITSU] Have a good day!

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:44.132 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Akagami!

00:02:44.264 --> 00:02:46.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
Are you ready for our duel?

00:02:48.936 --> 00:02:50.337 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yes, Mia.

00:02:50.772 --> 00:02:52.974 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Calling me by my first name?

00:02:53.107 --> 00:02:55.009 position:19% line:89% align:start
How very presumptuous.

00:02:55.143 --> 00:02:57.111 position:10% line:89% align:start
Mia Christoph, to be precise.

00:02:57.244 --> 00:03:00.548 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I was lodging here
long before you ever showed up!

00:03:00.682 --> 00:03:01.649 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seniority!

00:03:01.783 --> 00:03:04.384 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.
So, we're in the same boat?

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.020 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're not in the same anything!

00:03:06.154 --> 00:03:08.790 position:13% line:83% align:start
Honestly! Not that it's any
of your business...

00:03:08.923 --> 00:03:12.060 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Oh, and I'm Kagura.
-Pleased to meet you.

00:03:12.192 --> 00:03:13.393 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hey, don't ignore me!

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:15.328 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm a fellow lodger
at the convent,

00:03:15.462 --> 00:03:17.230 position:13% line:89% align:start
as well as Mia's attendant.

00:03:17.364 --> 00:03:19.567 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah, does that mean
you're also her sister?

00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:22.235 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Older sister, yes.
-We aren't sisters!

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:24.237 position:7% line:89% align:start
And you are not older than me!

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:26.306 position:21% line:89% align:start
I was thinking, Mia.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.743 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why not call off
this "duel" business?

00:03:28.876 --> 00:03:30.678 position:16% line:89% align:start
Huh? Are you mocking me?

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:34.982 position:10% line:83% align:start
Surely you haven't forgotten
the atrocity you perpetrated!

00:03:36.017 --> 00:03:37.284 position:35% line:89% align:start
[confused]

00:03:37.417 --> 00:03:39.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
I truly hate you
for what you've done!

00:03:39.453 --> 00:03:40.420 position:35% line:89% align:start
I swear it!

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:42.156 position:21% line:89% align:start
I will castrate you!

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:44.892 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:03:48.663 --> 00:03:52.200 position:19% line:83% align:start
-"Atrocity." Remind me-
-[angry]

00:03:52.332 --> 00:03:53.901 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:03:59.372 --> 00:04:02.510 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, uh. What's the plan?

00:04:04.145 --> 00:04:05.913 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Hyakunin Isshu.

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:11.384 position:10% line:83% align:start
Long ago, there was a samurai
who saved a hundred lives

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.554 position:5% line:89% align:start
by bringing one life to an end.

00:04:14.421 --> 00:04:16.289 position:30% line:83% align:start
And the contest
to select that savior

00:04:16.423 --> 00:04:18.693 position:13% line:89% align:start
is known as Hyakunin Isshu!

00:04:19.426 --> 00:04:21.062 position:19% line:89% align:start
Japan's national sport!

00:04:21.195 --> 00:04:22.864 position:16% line:89% align:start
Uh, pretty sure it isn't!

00:04:22.997 --> 00:04:25.365 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ready? Let's begin!

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.205 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Okay.

00:04:31.338 --> 00:04:32.673 position:30% line:89% align:start
She's serious.

00:04:33.473 --> 00:04:34.776 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Prepare yourself.

00:04:35.643 --> 00:04:37.678 position:5% line:89% align:start
Next time, I'll pierce the skin.

00:04:37.812 --> 00:04:39.479 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
This looks bad.

00:04:39.614 --> 00:04:43.151 position:16% line:83% align:start
Still, whatever happens,
I won't hurt Mia.

00:04:43.283 --> 00:04:46.386 position:13% line:89% align:start
Very well. I did warn you!

00:04:47.989 --> 00:04:51.659 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Bare-handed Sword Stopper!

00:04:52.359 --> 00:04:54.629 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:04:54.762 --> 00:04:56.631 position:38% line:89% align:start
Let's go!

00:04:57.665 --> 00:05:01.536 position:13% line:89% align:start
Huh? Goodness me. [giggles]

00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:04.739 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:05:05.472 --> 00:05:08.943 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Her breasts.
They popped out.

00:05:09.544 --> 00:05:11.946 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look away!

00:05:12.412 --> 00:05:14.048 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Grant me salvation!

00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:18.519 position:30% line:89% align:start
There they are!

00:05:19.187 --> 00:05:20.955 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:05:21.088 --> 00:05:25.425 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
And they're utterly magnificent!

00:05:31.933 --> 00:05:33.400 position:10% line:89% align:start
Whoa, are you all right, Mia?

00:05:33.534 --> 00:05:35.269 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
My, my.

00:05:35.402 --> 00:05:36.871 position:19% line:89% align:start
That settles it, then!

00:05:37.004 --> 00:05:40.274 position:21% line:83% align:start
In light of her loss,
Mia will have to be penalized.

00:05:40.407 --> 00:05:43.177 position:19% line:83% align:start
You really crapped out,
huh, Mia?

00:05:43.311 --> 00:05:46.080 position:24% line:89% align:start
No way. My binding.

00:05:46.214 --> 00:05:50.117 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you say, Akagami?
How should Mia be punished?

00:05:50.251 --> 00:05:51.652 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
I have to decide?

00:05:51.786 --> 00:05:54.354 position:10% line:83% align:start
Oh. If you're having trouble,
please allow me!

00:05:55.388 --> 00:05:58.659 position:16% line:83% align:start
I have here an extremely
rare collection of penances.

00:05:58.793 --> 00:06:02.563 position:5% line:83% align:start
An encyclopedia of the world's
most unusual ascetic practices,

00:06:02.697 --> 00:06:04.966 position:33% line:83% align:start
one of which
we'll impose on Mia!

00:06:05.266 --> 00:06:08.169 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] A collection
of penances? For real?

00:06:08.302 --> 00:06:09.937 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, take a look at this one.

00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:12.540 position:10% line:83% align:start
It involves inserting objects
into every orifice

00:06:12.673 --> 00:06:15.509 position:10% line:83% align:start
and enduring various things.
Can you imagine?

00:06:15.643 --> 00:06:18.445 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[MIA] Every orifice?
-Yep.

00:06:18.579 --> 00:06:20.815 position:27% line:83% align:start
-Various things?
-Yep.

00:06:20.948 --> 00:06:23.718 position:33% line:83% align:start
-I'll do it!
-Wait a second!

00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:26.787 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Don't you pity me!
-[AKEMITSU] Please, hear me out!

00:06:26.921 --> 00:06:29.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
If it's up to me,
there's something else I want.

00:06:29.523 --> 00:06:30.725 position:35% line:89% align:start
What is it?

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:33.661 position:13% line:89% align:start
What I want from you is...

00:06:36.597 --> 00:06:38.032 position:33% line:89% align:start
Right there.

00:06:38.165 --> 00:06:39.133 position:35% line:89% align:start
[question]

00:06:44.505 --> 00:06:45.539 position:24% line:89% align:start
Do we have a deal?

00:06:45.673 --> 00:06:48.342 position:10% line:89% align:start
[scared] Hold on, seriously?

00:06:48.843 --> 00:06:50.578 position:16% line:89% align:start
What you want from me is-

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:53.480 position:16% line:83% align:start
-I'll be really careful!
-But. I mean...

00:06:53.614 --> 00:06:55.516 position:38% line:83% align:start
Come on!
Give me just one night!

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:57.351 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just one night?

00:06:57.484 --> 00:06:59.520 position:24% line:83% align:start
Long enough to try
a few things out!

00:06:59.654 --> 00:07:01.155 position:21% line:89% align:start
Try a few things out?

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:03.391 position:16% line:89% align:start
Please. I want it so bad.

00:07:03.524 --> 00:07:05.793 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Absolutely, no freaking way!

00:07:05.927 --> 00:07:09.063 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You keep your hands off me!
-My, my.

00:07:09.462 --> 00:07:11.098 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggle]

00:07:13.801 --> 00:07:14.969 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Oh, well.

00:07:15.336 --> 00:07:18.438 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tried to play nice,
but it just didn't work out.

00:07:19.774 --> 00:07:21.509 position:21% line:89% align:start
It really is a shame.

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.477 position:16% line:89% align:start
Such an interesting book.

00:07:29.116 --> 00:07:32.086 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm sure it would point me
towards enlightenment.

00:07:37.758 --> 00:07:40.394 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Let's settle this
once and for all.

00:07:40.528 --> 00:07:42.063 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mia, what are you...

00:07:42.663 --> 00:07:46.033 position:38% line:83% align:start
[nervous]
One night, just like you said.

00:07:46.767 --> 00:07:49.804 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm ready to accept my penalty
now.

00:07:51.072 --> 00:07:53.741 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] I don't understand
what's happening.

00:07:54.208 --> 00:07:58.546 position:24% line:83% align:start
I sort of felt like
I was running away.

00:07:59.046 --> 00:08:00.381 position:38% line:89% align:start
So, um...

00:08:00.514 --> 00:08:02.249 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Here.

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:04.618 position:27% line:89% align:start
Do what you want.

00:08:05.286 --> 00:08:06.520 position:33% line:89% align:start
But hurry up.

00:08:07.054 --> 00:08:09.924 position:13% line:83% align:start
This is really embarrassing
for me.

00:08:10.057 --> 00:08:11.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:08:12.326 --> 00:08:14.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
This is what you wanted, right?

00:08:16.063 --> 00:08:19.567 position:35% line:83% align:start
It's fine.
Everything will be fine.

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:23.170 position:21% line:89% align:start
Really. After all...

00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.607 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[shock]
-This dream we're experiencing

00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:28.509 position:13% line:89% align:start
will only last for tonight.

00:08:28.642 --> 00:08:32.246 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Dream? I see.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:34.448 position:24% line:89% align:start
So this is a dream.

00:08:34.782 --> 00:08:36.717 position:33% line:89% align:start
In that case.

00:08:36.851 --> 00:08:40.988 position:21% line:83% align:start

anyone's watching.

-Wait, Kagura?
-Hey.

00:08:45.526 --> 00:08:47.795 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is really happening!

00:08:47.928 --> 00:08:50.398 position:27% line:83% align:start
Mia! Why on Earth
are you doing this?

00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:51.866 position:13% line:89% align:start
[scared] Well, you know...

00:08:51.999 --> 00:08:55.069 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] [realize]
The penalty. Of course.

00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:56.003 position:33% line:89% align:start
I get it now.

00:08:56.137 --> 00:08:58.305 position:10% line:89% align:start
Please, this isn't necessary!

00:08:59.006 --> 00:09:00.908 position:7% line:83% align:start
I understand if you don't want
to hand over

00:09:01.042 --> 00:09:02.576 position:10% line:89% align:start
the "Collection of Penances",

00:09:02.710 --> 00:09:05.012 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you don't have
to surrender your virtue!

00:09:05.146 --> 00:09:07.481 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can only imagine
what that toll must be worth

00:09:07.615 --> 00:09:09.016 position:24% line:89% align:start
but nevertheless...

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.952 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're saying all you wanted
from me was a book?

00:09:12.086 --> 00:09:14.655 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Yes! Of course! Hold on.

00:09:14.789 --> 00:09:16.490 position:24% line:83% align:start
What did you think
I was pointing at earlier?

Not quite on the same page, huh?

I've never been so embarrassed
in my entire life!

00:09:30.805 --> 00:09:32.073 position:19% line:89% align:start
How could this happen?

00:09:32.206 --> 00:09:34.975 position:7% line:83% align:start
How could I have gotten things
so wrong?

[panting, sigh]

00:09:37.178 --> 00:09:41.082 position:10% line:83% align:start
What business does a man have
in a place like this, anyway?

00:09:45.186 --> 00:09:47.855 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'll hide in the shed
and meditate.

I might find you here.

Damn you, Kagura!

00:09:58.299 --> 00:10:00.000 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
So what are you up to?

00:10:00.134 --> 00:10:02.203 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's none of your concern.

Huh? No way!

[AKEMITSU] The window's clearly
not an option.

00:10:17.618 --> 00:10:19.019 position:16% line:89% align:start
We don't have our phones.

00:10:19.153 --> 00:10:21.523 position:21% line:83% align:start
And even if we yell,
will anyone hear us?

00:10:21.655 --> 00:10:23.624 position:27% line:89% align:start
I doubt it. Huh.

00:10:24.358 --> 00:10:26.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
We may be stuck in here
till morning.

Here, take this blanket.

00:10:38.573 --> 00:10:40.141 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's cold.

00:10:40.274 --> 00:10:42.511 position:13% line:83% align:start

that's been touched by a man.

00:10:43.277 --> 00:10:46.213 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] I'll just leave it
over here, then.

00:10:47.748 --> 00:10:49.316 position:21% line:89% align:start
What a peculiar desk.

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.418 position:27% line:89% align:start
Mia. What's this?

00:10:52.019 --> 00:10:54.688 position:13% line:83% align:start
Why should I have to answer
any of your questions?

00:10:57.758 --> 00:10:59.628 position:5% line:89% align:start
It's a sutra transcription desk.

00:11:00.161 --> 00:11:02.396 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's for displaying
the heads of those who turn away

00:11:02.531 --> 00:11:04.131 position:10% line:89% align:start
from the Buddha's teachings.

Seriously?

That's what Kagura told me.

00:11:07.902 --> 00:11:10.738 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sure your head
will sit there, eventually.

00:11:10.871 --> 00:11:12.139 position:10% line:89% align:start
To think you'd join a temple

so basic.

Sure you don't want this?

I don't need it.

It'll only get colder
during the night.

Stop being so kind to me.

And what happened earlier, too,

You want me to forget that?

Uh, kind of a difficult request.

Out of character, huh?

00:12:49.370 --> 00:12:51.305 position:10% line:83% align:start

Well, the thing is,
that was actually the real me.

It seems like
no matter what I do,

I can't escape
from my true nature.

It's as if I'm cursed.

00:13:03.984 --> 00:13:06.153 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's the reason
I came to Japan.

The reason you came here?

-See-

00:13:11.559 --> 00:13:14.729 position:30% line:83% align:start

My relatives and I

Listen well, Mia.

A woman who belongs

Is it?

it's a subject I myself

[Mia shocks]

00:15:26.761 --> 00:15:28.830 position:13% line:89% align:start
I feel so close to you now.

00:15:28.962 --> 00:15:32.332 position:7% line:83% align:start
I never realized somebody else
was going through this, too!

00:15:32.466 --> 00:15:36.504 position:10% line:83% align:start
-It hasn't been easy, has it?
-Nuh-uh!

[realize]

00:15:39.173 --> 00:15:43.310 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIA] What a coincidence.
Or could it be fate?

00:15:43.912 --> 00:15:47.948 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Maybe with him, I could-
-[crying]

00:15:50.217 --> 00:15:52.453 position:21% line:89% align:start
I never learn, do I?

00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:56.356 position:16% line:83% align:start
Once again, I let myself
get all carried away.

00:15:58.292 --> 00:16:01.863 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll keep running
from the Christoph family,

00:16:01.995 --> 00:16:05.365 position:21% line:89% align:start
and now from Akagami.

[AKEMITSU]
Let's fight on, Mia!

00:16:07.968 --> 00:16:09.336 position:38% line:89% align:start
Together!

00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:12.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's so encouraging
to have an ally!

00:16:12.774 --> 00:16:16.043 position:13% line:83% align:start
Side by side, we'll pursue
the path of enlightenment!

00:16:18.312 --> 00:16:20.515 position:10% line:83% align:start
I wouldn't want to interfere
with your training.

00:16:20.648 --> 00:16:23.350 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Interfere away. I don't mind!

00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:26.788 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have to admit,
part of me still thinks

00:16:26.921 --> 00:16:28.890 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're only interested in me
for my body.

00:16:29.022 --> 00:16:30.558 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's right!

00:16:30.892 --> 00:16:32.025 position:30% line:89% align:start
I mean, wrong!

00:16:32.159 --> 00:16:33.661 position:35% line:83% align:start
I want you
as a training partner.

00:16:33.795 --> 00:16:36.430 position:19% line:83% align:start
[MIA] I can't promise
I won't get turned on.

00:16:36.564 --> 00:16:39.066 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Again, you, me, same boat.

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:41.736 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Good point.
We'll stick together.

00:16:42.336 --> 00:16:43.671 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's settled, then?

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:45.573 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:16:57.017 --> 00:16:58.653 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ta-da!

00:16:59.152 --> 00:17:00.254 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yo! Sup?

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:02.657 position:10% line:89% align:start
How long were you out there?

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.225 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Whole time.
-Why didn't you help us?

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:06.728 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Now, now.

00:17:06.861 --> 00:17:08.563 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's important
is you two patched things up.

00:17:08.696 --> 00:17:10.532 position:30% line:83% align:start
I don't suppose
you'd have any interest

00:17:10.665 --> 00:17:13.066 position:21% line:83% align:start
in performing penance
all night long?

-[determined]
-[smile]

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:16.804 position:38% line:89% align:start
Bring it!

00:17:16.938 --> 00:17:19.841 position:13% line:83% align:start
With my new ally beside me,
I'm filled with courage!

00:17:20.374 --> 00:17:21.943 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
We can do this!

00:17:22.075 --> 00:17:25.112 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU, MIA]
Hip, hip, hooray!

[YUZUKI]
Kagura? What are you-

00:17:41.529 --> 00:17:44.699 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Akagami,
you're almost there.

00:17:45.098 --> 00:17:46.968 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Here I come, Mia.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:48.402 position:38% line:89% align:start
[realize]

00:17:48.536 --> 00:17:53.007 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's fine. They're
performing penance. See?

[panting]

00:17:55.944 --> 00:17:58.613 position:10% line:83% align:start
I know you can make that hand
go farther than that!

00:17:58.746 --> 00:18:00.213 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah! You got it!

00:18:00.347 --> 00:18:02.517 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Hey, Mia.
I'm bumping into something.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.519 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Just stick it out, Akagami!

00:18:04.652 --> 00:18:07.622 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Hey! Yuzuki!
-[notice]

00:18:08.455 --> 00:18:09.724 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
What is this?

00:18:09.857 --> 00:18:11.091 position:24% line:89% align:start
Here, check it out.

00:18:11.224 --> 00:18:12.727 position:30% line:83% align:start
The two of them
have been going at it

00:18:12.860 --> 00:18:15.063 position:35% line:83% align:start
ferociously
all through the night!

00:18:15.195 --> 00:18:16.463 position:30% line:89% align:start
[grunts pants]

00:18:16.898 --> 00:18:18.700 position:24% line:89% align:start
All night, you say?

00:18:21.301 --> 00:18:24.237 position:24% line:89% align:start
[panting, laughing]

00:18:29.911 --> 00:18:32.279 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Stop it!

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:40.989 position:13% line:89% align:start
What, did something happen?

00:18:41.121 --> 00:18:44.092 position:13% line:89% align:start
I dunno. But she seems mad.

00:18:44.224 --> 00:18:46.561 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Nonsense.
-[question]

00:18:46.694 --> 00:18:49.196 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[KIKI] By the way, Yuzuki.
-Yeah?

00:18:49.329 --> 00:18:51.431 position:27% line:83% align:start
You appear to be
awfully relaxed,

00:18:51.566 --> 00:18:53.735 position:30% line:83% align:start
but what about
your matchmaking meeting?

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:55.803 position:24% line:83% align:start
-It's today, right?
-[question]

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:58.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
Isn't that a pretty
important meeting?

00:18:58.438 --> 00:19:00.842 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like, the temple's future
depends on it?

00:19:00.975 --> 00:19:01.809 position:35% line:89% align:start
[question]

00:19:01.943 --> 00:19:04.411 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm going to be so late!

00:19:04.545 --> 00:19:06.213 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, where's the meeting?

00:19:06.346 --> 00:19:07.982 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ryukoku Temple.

00:19:08.116 --> 00:19:09.449 position:19% line:89% align:start
Think you can make it?

00:19:09.584 --> 00:19:11.586 position:35% line:83% align:start
Barely, and
that's if I catch the next bus!

00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:13.888 position:24% line:83% align:start
So in other words,
we better keep running!

00:19:15.255 --> 00:19:18.526 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then there's my kimono.
I'll need to change somewhere!

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:20.995 position:13% line:83% align:start
I worked at a kimono shop,
so I can help!

00:19:21.562 --> 00:19:22.930 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
You did that, too?

00:19:23.064 --> 00:19:24.632 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Hey. You think
you should let him know

00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:26.701 position:21% line:83% align:start
-you're running late?
-[YUZUKI] No way!

00:19:26.834 --> 00:19:28.703 position:21% line:83% align:start
I have to make sure
this goes perfectly,

00:19:28.836 --> 00:19:29.837 position:24% line:89% align:start
for all our sakes!

00:19:29.971 --> 00:19:31.639 position:16% line:89% align:start
And why is that, exactly?

00:19:31.773 --> 00:19:34.008 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
The truth is, as things stand,

00:19:34.142 --> 00:19:36.144 position:19% line:83% align:start
we're actually supposed
to move out of the temple

00:19:36.276 --> 00:19:37.545 position:21% line:89% align:start
as soon as possible.

00:19:37.679 --> 00:19:39.013 position:35% line:89% align:start
[question]

00:19:39.147 --> 00:19:41.849 position:5% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] My parents are priests,
but don't reside at the temple.

00:19:42.315 --> 00:19:44.418 position:38% line:83% align:start
And since
there's no head priest around,

00:19:44.552 --> 00:19:46.754 position:19% line:83% align:start
our family has no right
to live there.

00:19:46.888 --> 00:19:50.124 position:21% line:83% align:start
We're only there now
because Kiki's helping us out.

00:19:50.257 --> 00:19:52.560 position:19% line:83% align:start
But we can't expect her
to stay forever.

00:19:52.694 --> 00:19:55.228 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was told that once
I graduate high school,

00:19:55.362 --> 00:19:57.532 position:13% line:89% align:start
the temple will be closed.

00:19:57.665 --> 00:19:58.566 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:01.569 position:7% line:83% align:start
Unless this matchmaking meeting
is a big success,

00:20:01.703 --> 00:20:03.504 position:5% line:89% align:start
and a new head priest moves in.

00:20:03.638 --> 00:20:04.906 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Wow.

00:20:05.039 --> 00:20:06.574 position:21% line:83% align:start
So you'd get married
just to save the temple?

00:20:06.708 --> 00:20:08.743 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you really okay with that?

00:20:08.876 --> 00:20:11.344 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's my decision to make
and no one else's.

00:20:11.478 --> 00:20:14.347 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not going to allow
the temple to be closed!

00:20:16.416 --> 00:20:19.453 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'll get there in time!
I promise!

00:20:19.587 --> 00:20:20.855 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:20:20.988 --> 00:20:23.758 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] After all that,
we missed the bus.

00:20:24.458 --> 00:20:26.426 position:24% line:83% align:start
And there's no way
we can run that far.

00:20:26.561 --> 00:20:27.695 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Yuzuki!

00:20:27.829 --> 00:20:29.731 position:16% line:83% align:start
This guy's gonna loan us
his scooter!

00:20:29.864 --> 00:20:31.465 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
When did that happen?

00:20:31.599 --> 00:20:34.535 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Hold on tight, okay?
-You sure you can do this?

00:20:35.169 --> 00:20:36.604 position:16% line:89% align:start
I know all the shortcuts.

00:20:36.738 --> 00:20:39.207 position:19% line:83% align:start
Used to work part-time
as a deliveryman.

00:20:39.339 --> 00:20:42.375 position:35% line:83% align:start
Seriously?
What job haven't you had?

00:20:47.347 --> 00:20:50.317 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
We ran out of gas.

00:20:51.351 --> 00:20:52.820 position:27% line:89% align:start
Is that the bus?

00:20:52.954 --> 00:20:54.354 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's hurry!

00:20:56.190 --> 00:20:58.960 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:21:01.829 --> 00:21:04.098 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Who mistakes a truck for a bus?

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:06.266 position:19% line:89% align:start
I must be a real idiot.

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:07.602 position:24% line:89% align:start
An absolute idiot,

00:21:07.735 --> 00:21:09.436 position:27% line:83% align:start
and don't forget
completely useless.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:11.539 position:13% line:83% align:start
Miss Third Daughter's head.
Stop that!

00:21:11.672 --> 00:21:13.708 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's a useless,
perverted idiot.

00:21:13.841 --> 00:21:15.308 position:24% line:83% align:start
Be that as it may,
you're not helping,

00:21:15.442 --> 00:21:16.944 position:27% line:89% align:start
all right? Stop!

00:21:17.745 --> 00:21:19.647 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I'm sorry, Akagami.

00:21:19.781 --> 00:21:22.717 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm afraid I let your efforts
go to waste.

00:21:24.051 --> 00:21:27.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
I thought I could do it.
Save the temple.

00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:29.557 position:16% line:89% align:start
But maybe it's hopeless.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:32.994 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki.

00:21:34.729 --> 00:21:36.964 position:21% line:89% align:start
[surprise, question]

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:39.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is your opportunity
to change.

00:21:39.934 --> 00:21:41.035 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:41.169 --> 00:21:42.637 position:33% line:89% align:start
Your kimono!

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.471 position:16% line:83% align:start
Put it on now, and we'll
get out at the next flight!

00:21:44.605 --> 00:21:46.107 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
But...

00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:48.308 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we'll borrow this truck
to get where we're going!

00:21:48.441 --> 00:21:49.944 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's fine. As it happens,

00:21:50.077 --> 00:21:52.013 position:33% line:83% align:start
I used to be
a truck driver, too.

Why would they let us borrow it,
though?

00:21:54.048 --> 00:21:55.883 position:16% line:83% align:start
Eh, I'll throw some money
at 'em!

00:21:56.017 --> 00:21:58.085 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] But you're already
in debt as it is!

[AKEMITSU] [laugh]
Hey, what have I got to lose?

00:22:01.522 --> 00:22:03.257 position:38% line:83% align:start
Nothing,
and that's the problem here!

[laughing]

00:22:11.431 --> 00:22:12.900 position:27% line:89% align:start
All right, then.

00:22:13.034 --> 00:22:14.502 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

00:22:14.635 --> 00:22:15.803 position:13% line:89% align:start
Time to get this kimono on,

00:22:15.937 --> 00:22:17.839 position:21% line:83% align:start
and then we'll break
the door down!

00:22:17.972 --> 00:22:19.807 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's the spirit!

[YUZUKI]
No matter what...

00:22:21.474 --> 00:22:22.910 position:24% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI, AKEMITSU]
We won't give up!

00:23:52.733 --> 00:23:55.002 position:33% line:83% align:start
-This is bad.
-What's the problem?

00:23:55.136 --> 00:23:57.872 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yuzu is- She's in a- a...

-Adachi?
-No, that's not it!

00:24:00.608 --> 00:24:03.811 position:30% line:83% align:start
-She's in a lo-
-Love hotel?

00:24:03.945 --> 00:24:07.515 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yes, good! No, wait!
It's bad!
