[TSUKINA] You wanna take over
the temple someday?

00:00:16.283 --> 00:00:17.519 position:30% line:89% align:start
Really, Yuzuki?

00:00:17.986 --> 00:00:19.186 position:35% line:83% align:start
[giggling]
Yeah!

00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:21.121 position:27% line:83% align:start
Running a temple
can be quite difficult.

00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.891 position:7% line:89% align:start
Why would you want to do that?

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.058 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, it's because I...

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:26.794 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:01:58.352 --> 00:02:00.253 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Akagami and I
haven't spoken at all

00:02:00.387 --> 00:02:01.589 position:30% line:89% align:start
since that day.

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.091 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Never mind!

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.027 position:19% line:83% align:start
All of this has nothing
to do with you!

00:02:06.594 --> 00:02:10.031 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Is he mad at me?
Of course, he must be.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:11.264 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:02:11.398 --> 00:02:13.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
I should just apologize.

00:02:14.201 --> 00:02:17.071 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I will.
Akagami's a good guy.

00:02:17.204 --> 00:02:18.372 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm sure he'll forgive me.

00:02:18.506 --> 00:02:20.207 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Oh, man. Thank you so much.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.576 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[woman laughing]
-[YUZUKI] I hear his voice.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:22.977 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
It's fine, really!

00:02:23.111 --> 00:02:24.177 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just don't lose it again, okay?

00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:25.880 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I won't. I'll be careful.

00:02:26.014 --> 00:02:27.615 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Tsukuyo laughs]

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.349 position:7% line:83% align:start
Let me know if you if you need
me to show you how to use it.

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:31.251 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[AKAGAMI] Thanks again.
-[TSUKUYO] It's no problem!

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:33.554 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
What am I doing?

00:02:33.688 --> 00:02:35.489 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have no reason
to be running away!

00:02:37.424 --> 00:02:38.826 position:27% line:89% align:start
[Yuzuki screams]

00:02:39.927 --> 00:02:40.962 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:02:41.328 --> 00:02:43.698 position:27% line:89% align:start
[birds chirping]

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:45.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Looks like decent
job opportunities

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.102 position:30% line:83% align:start
are few and far
between this early in the year.

00:02:48.803 --> 00:02:50.605 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Fine! If it's got
nothing to do with me,

00:02:50.738 --> 00:02:52.907 position:19% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm free to do
what I want!

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.510 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] That was pretty
childish of me, wasn't it?

00:02:56.243 --> 00:02:59.346 position:10% line:83% align:start
Right! I'll talk to her today
and patch things up!

00:03:00.848 --> 00:03:02.884 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Oh, hey! Good morning!

00:03:03.283 --> 00:03:04.519 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:06.486 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, good morning.

00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:09.322 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's get out there
and do our best today!

00:03:10.223 --> 00:03:11.159 position:44% line:89% align:start
Sure.

00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.326 position:16% line:89% align:start
[grunting and screaming]

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:14.529 position:35% line:89% align:start
No! Yuzuki!

00:03:15.228 --> 00:03:17.799 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Just wanted
to immerse myself in Buddhism!

00:03:19.534 --> 00:03:20.768 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Are you all right?

00:03:21.035 --> 00:03:22.070 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Totally fine!

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:23.805 position:21% line:89% align:start
Don't worry about it.

00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:25.606 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Um, Yuzuki?

00:03:26.107 --> 00:03:27.340 position:16% line:89% align:start
I wanted to talk to you.

00:03:27.474 --> 00:03:28.676 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
One moment.

00:03:29.177 --> 00:03:30.611 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Kiki?
-Yuzuki?

00:03:30.812 --> 00:03:33.147 position:16% line:83% align:start
Could you take those out
to the storage shed for me?

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:34.682 position:38% line:89% align:start
Oh. Yeah.

00:03:35.149 --> 00:03:36.684 position:19% line:89% align:start
And you, come with me.

00:03:37.051 --> 00:03:38.285 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'd like to have a word.

00:03:39.654 --> 00:03:40.521 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:03:41.022 --> 00:03:43.624 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] All right.
What did you want to discuss?

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:46.761 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Did something happen
between you two?

00:03:48.162 --> 00:03:50.330 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well, um, actually...

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.134 position:41% line:89% align:start
[purrs]

00:03:53.668 --> 00:03:55.268 position:13% line:89% align:start
You don't have to say more.

00:03:55.402 --> 00:03:57.505 position:41% line:83% align:start
I see.
It's just a lovers' quarrel.

00:03:57.638 --> 00:03:59.607 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Lovers?
She and I aren't in love.

00:03:59.741 --> 00:04:02.043 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Yeah, sure,
keep telling yourself that.

00:04:02.176 --> 00:04:05.245 position:19% line:83% align:start
We did quarrel, though.
We were both being stubborn.

00:04:05.613 --> 00:04:07.181 position:16% line:89% align:start
And somehow it escalated.

00:04:07.447 --> 00:04:08.683 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:04:09.917 --> 00:04:10.852 position:27% line:89% align:start
Tell me, Akagami.

00:04:10.985 --> 00:04:12.787 position:21% line:83% align:start
What am I pointing at
right now?

00:04:13.521 --> 00:04:14.689 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Your boobs.
-Right.

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:16.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm pointing at me, Kiki.

00:04:17.125 --> 00:04:20.293 position:21% line:83% align:start
Exactly. That's just
what I was trying to say.

00:04:20.561 --> 00:04:23.631 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm Kiki, but I'm also a nun,
head priest, and master.

00:04:23.765 --> 00:04:25.767 position:16% line:83% align:start
A single person perceived
as many different things

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.802 position:10% line:83% align:start
by different people, although
as far as you're concerned,

00:04:27.935 --> 00:04:30.138 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm apparently nothing more
than a big pair of tits.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:31.672 position:44% line:89% align:start
Eep!

00:04:31.806 --> 00:04:33.174 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] "Point at the moon,
and you see a finger."

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:34.776 position:30% line:83% align:start
In other words,
people's attention

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.277 position:27% line:83% align:start
tends to be drawn
to the extended finger itself

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:39.412 position:21% line:83% align:start
rather than the moon
it's directed at.

00:04:39.614 --> 00:04:42.282 position:16% line:83% align:start
Likewise, when I pointed
at my breasts,

00:04:42.482 --> 00:04:44.152 position:10% line:89% align:start
I knew it would distract you.

00:04:44.384 --> 00:04:45.887 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey, you set me up!

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.421 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] You can't allow yourself
to lose sight of what matters.

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:52.560 position:7% line:83% align:start
A finger is a prominent signal,
but if you never look past it,

00:04:52.693 --> 00:04:54.028 position:21% line:89% align:start
your gaze won't reach

00:04:54.162 --> 00:04:56.296 position:10% line:83% align:start
the moon you should be paying
attention to.

00:04:56.429 --> 00:04:58.633 position:33% line:83% align:start
Interesting.
But what does it mean?

00:04:58.766 --> 00:05:01.035 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why don't you describe
Yuzuki to me?

00:05:01.202 --> 00:05:02.603 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tell me how you see her.

00:05:04.205 --> 00:05:05.438 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Yuzuki, huh?

00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:07.241 position:27% line:89% align:start
She's dependable.

00:05:07.642 --> 00:05:10.211 position:7% line:83% align:start
A bit careless at times, maybe.
But still..

00:05:10.845 --> 00:05:13.014 position:27% line:83% align:start
she's so positive
and well-adjusted.

00:05:15.216 --> 00:05:17.919 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's certainly a much
stronger person than I am.

00:05:18.786 --> 00:05:21.889 position:19% line:83% align:start
Perhaps you should take
a closer look, Akagami.

00:05:22.355 --> 00:05:23.323 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:05:23.456 --> 00:05:24.292 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Kiki.
-[purring]

00:05:24.424 --> 00:05:25.425 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's a guest here.

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.228 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's the purpose
of their visit?

00:05:27.795 --> 00:05:29.396 position:38% line:83% align:start
They said
they're leaving the temple.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.766 position:33% line:83% align:start
[Kiki gasps]
Providence!

00:05:31.966 --> 00:05:33.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
What do you mean?!

00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:34.735 position:16% line:89% align:start
They'll pay a ridan fee!

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.537 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] It's to remove
their family's grave

00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:38.539 position:21% line:83% align:start
and express gratitude
before they leave!

00:05:38.673 --> 00:05:40.407 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Shouldn't we be
unhappy that parishioners

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:41.809 position:19% line:89% align:start
are leaving the temple?

00:05:41.943 --> 00:05:44.078 position:27% line:83% align:start
Right now, money
is the most important thing!

00:05:44.312 --> 00:05:45.780 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is a blessing
from the Buddha!

00:05:45.947 --> 00:05:48.015 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Her priorities
are totally out of whack!

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:51.118 position:13% line:83% align:start
What a golden opportunity.
I'll make them fork over

00:05:51.252 --> 00:05:53.221 position:21% line:83% align:start
a hundred times more
than what they owe!

00:05:53.353 --> 00:05:55.756 position:35% line:83% align:start
No, Master!
You can't do that!

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.031 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] They're
going to transfer their grave

00:06:04.165 --> 00:06:05.365 position:35% line:83% align:start
to a temple
in their neighborhood.

00:06:05.498 --> 00:06:06.801 position:27% line:89% align:start
[birds chirping]

00:06:06.934 --> 00:06:08.703 position:7% line:89% align:start
The location's more convenient.

00:06:08.903 --> 00:06:10.037 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Please tell me
you demanded

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.371 position:19% line:89% align:start
a ridan fee from them!

00:06:11.772 --> 00:06:13.440 position:33% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Huh?
No, of course not.

00:06:13.574 --> 00:06:14.642 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kiki stutters]

00:06:14.775 --> 00:06:16.010 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was Mother's policy.

00:06:16.177 --> 00:06:18.212 position:19% line:83% align:start
She would never enforce
ridan fees.

00:06:18.613 --> 00:06:20.114 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[Kiki sighs]
-They should be optional.

00:06:20.548 --> 00:06:22.717 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
It's a fair point, but still..

00:06:23.084 --> 00:06:24.685 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
When my mother was around,

00:06:24.852 --> 00:06:26.721 position:21% line:83% align:start
they kept coming here
even though the location

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:28.122 position:19% line:89% align:start
wasn't ideal for them.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.224 position:27% line:83% align:start
They said the way
things are now,

00:06:30.358 --> 00:06:32.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
they can't trust
Mikazuki Temple.

00:06:32.326 --> 00:06:35.229 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:37.031 position:35% line:83% align:start
Obviously,
I'm nowhere near as good

00:06:37.164 --> 00:06:39.300 position:30% line:83% align:start
at any of this
as my mother used to be.

00:06:39.967 --> 00:06:42.435 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've been working really hard
and doing my very best

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:43.905 position:7% line:89% align:start
to earn everyone's trust here,

00:06:44.205 --> 00:06:46.941 position:30% line:83% align:start
but apparently,
it wasn't good enough.

Well, all right, then!

even harder from now on!

Uh, Yuzuki?

[sighing]

00:06:56.083 --> 00:06:57.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki, as of today,

00:06:57.151 --> 00:06:58.886 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm putting an end
to your training.

00:06:59.153 --> 00:07:01.522 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's it. We're done.

Master, why?

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:08.095 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] You'll have to
figure it out on your own.

[TSUKINA] Running a temple

Why would you want to do that?

00:07:20.408 --> 00:07:21.809 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Well, it's because I...

00:07:22.843 --> 00:07:23.911 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
That's funny.

00:07:24.111 --> 00:07:26.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
I can't remember
how I answered her.

00:07:32.219 --> 00:07:34.956 position:10% line:83% align:start

00:07:39.126 --> 00:07:40.594 position:27% line:83% align:start
I don't have time
to be depressed.

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:43.463 position:7% line:83% align:start
After all, there's far too much
work to do around here!

00:07:44.398 --> 00:07:46.367 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm gonna start this new year
off the right way

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:48.302 position:30% line:83% align:start
by working hard
and doing my best!

[KURAGE]
Your best at what?

00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:51.639 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Oh! Well, uh...

[MIA]
Committing harakiri and writing

your New Year's calligraphy

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:57.979 position:24% line:83% align:start
Japan's more exotic
than I realized!

00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:00.014 position:10% line:89% align:start
I wasn't planning on it, no.

00:08:00.314 --> 00:08:02.717 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] She means chores
like airing out the cushions,

00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:04.151 position:10% line:89% align:start
maintaining the tatami mats,

00:08:04.285 --> 00:08:06.053 position:33% line:83% align:start
and polishing
the Buddhist artifacts.

00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:08.122 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, exactly. There are
plenty of other things

00:08:08.255 --> 00:08:10.391 position:21% line:83% align:start
to do around a temple
besides training.

00:08:10.658 --> 00:08:12.526 position:33% line:83% align:start
You're right.
But most of that stuff,

00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:13.961 position:21% line:89% align:start
Akagami's been doing.

00:08:14.595 --> 00:08:15.696 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Haven't you
noticed he's been

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.365 position:27% line:83% align:start
keeping the place
sparkling clean?

00:08:17.631 --> 00:08:20.267 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] As far as the cushions
and mats, he airs them out

00:08:20.401 --> 00:08:21.569 position:24% line:89% align:start
on a regular basis.

00:08:21.702 --> 00:08:22.803 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Yeah, and I help him polish

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:24.271 position:16% line:89% align:start
whatever needs polishing!

00:08:24.638 --> 00:08:26.574 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Okay, but there's
still other work to be done!

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.275 position:30% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] True,
but it won't take too long

00:08:28.409 --> 00:08:29.543 position:21% line:89% align:start
if we work together.

00:08:29.677 --> 00:08:33.214 position:24% line:83% align:start
Uh-huh. Hey, wait.
Where is Akagami?

00:08:33.714 --> 00:08:35.583 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] Kiki had
some business to tend to,

00:08:35.716 --> 00:08:37.018 position:21% line:89% align:start
and he went with her.

00:08:37.385 --> 00:08:38.786 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What for?
-Listen...

00:08:39.020 --> 00:08:41.389 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm curious too,
but I couldn't say.

00:08:42.056 --> 00:08:44.525 position:13% line:89% align:start
My messages are all unread.

00:08:45.026 --> 00:08:46.894 position:13% line:89% align:start
No matter how many I send.

00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:49.797 position:10% line:89% align:start
So you have Akagami's number?

00:08:50.765 --> 00:08:52.333 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why do you have
that information?

00:08:52.466 --> 00:08:54.769 position:21% line:83% align:start
And more importantly,
why don't I have it?

00:08:54.902 --> 00:08:56.070 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE]
I don't have it either,

00:08:56.203 --> 00:08:58.072 position:30% line:83% align:start
and I suddenly
want it very badly.

00:08:58.339 --> 00:08:59.407 position:41% line:83% align:start
[Both]
No fair!

00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:02.109 position:33% line:83% align:start
That's funny,
because I have it.

00:09:02.476 --> 00:09:03.744 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait, why do you have it?

00:09:04.111 --> 00:09:05.679 position:27% line:83% align:start
[Kagura laughing]
Oh, you know.

00:09:05.813 --> 00:09:07.681 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] It's truly unfair
for you to have a leg up

00:09:07.815 --> 00:09:09.116 position:10% line:89% align:start
on the rest of us, you know.

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.684 position:24% line:83% align:start
[MIA] And it's all
because you conquered

00:09:10.818 --> 00:09:12.019 position:30% line:89% align:start
Akagami first!

00:09:12.219 --> 00:09:13.254 position:38% line:83% align:start

Before anything else,

Leave it to Akagami.

Believe me.

[YUZUKI] That's right.
I have to do something.

00:10:34.034 --> 00:10:35.870 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki to resume her training!

As things stand,
Yuzuki is unfit.

to be the head priest

Right now,
Yuzuki has some things

00:10:55.189 --> 00:10:57.224 position:19% line:83% align:start
she needs to figure out
for herself.

00:10:58.425 --> 00:10:59.528 position:19% line:89% align:start

Won't you reconsider?

So, Akagami...

Yuzuki to me?

Yuzuki, huh?

She's dependable.

00:11:46.608 --> 00:11:49.376 position:7% line:83% align:start
A bit careless at times, maybe.
But still...

[YUZUKI]
Why can't I do it?

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.180 position:24% line:89% align:start
Tell me, Mother...

00:13:34.014 --> 00:13:36.116 position:33% line:83% align:start
is it because
I'm not good enough?

00:13:36.751 --> 00:13:38.520 position:16% line:89% align:start
Am I lacking in some way?

00:13:39.486 --> 00:13:44.224 position:19% line:83% align:start
Then I'll work harder,
and harder, until I'm perfect.

[KIKI]
Yuzuki, as of today,

00:13:46.894 --> 00:13:48.630 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm putting an end
to your training.

00:13:48.929 --> 00:13:50.998 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Harder and harder.

00:13:51.231 --> 00:13:52.866 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKINA]
You can't do it, Yuzuki!

00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.203 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Harder,
and harder, and harder still.

00:13:56.437 --> 00:13:58.005 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKINA]
You can't do it, Yuzuki.

00:13:58.872 --> 00:14:02.811 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] So, please. Please
don't take the temple away.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:05.179 position:38% line:83% align:start
[sobbing]
Come back, Mother.

00:14:07.682 --> 00:14:09.283 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I'm so cold.

00:14:09.917 --> 00:14:11.653 position:27% line:89% align:start

[screaming and grunting]

00:14:13.621 --> 00:14:17.458 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Could she be there?
Not a chance. No way!

00:14:17.991 --> 00:14:20.595 position:21% line:89% align:start
I mean, it's Yuzuki.

00:14:21.195 --> 00:14:24.632 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's strong.
Much stronger than I am.

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:36.210 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Perhaps you should
take a closer look, Akagami.

00:14:44.786 --> 00:14:46.554 position:33% line:89% align:start
Oh, it's you.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:48.989 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
All this time...

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:51.626 position:27% line:83% align:start
what part of her
have I been looking at?

00:14:52.292 --> 00:14:54.428 position:27% line:83% align:start
She faked a smile
when she was sad.

00:14:55.129 --> 00:14:57.364 position:30% line:83% align:start
She acted tough
when she felt weak.

00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:02.002 position:10% line:89% align:start
But the truth is, she's so...

00:15:03.772 --> 00:15:07.007 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:24.958 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
You're so warm, Akagami.

00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:39.006 position:41% line:83% align:start
No use.
Can't get up with this fever.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.976 position:38% line:89% align:start
[snoring]

00:15:43.110 --> 00:15:44.178 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akagami?!

00:15:44.311 --> 00:15:45.847 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Oh, Yuzuki, you're awake!

00:15:46.514 --> 00:15:48.650 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Right, I need to apologize.

00:15:48.949 --> 00:15:50.685 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Okay, time to apologize.

00:15:51.018 --> 00:15:51.985 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
I'm so--

00:15:52.119 --> 00:15:54.455 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Both scream]

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.825 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I'm sorry.

00:15:57.257 --> 00:15:59.026 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
No. I'm sorry.

00:15:59.828 --> 00:16:02.362 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Yuzuki laughs]

00:16:02.496 --> 00:16:05.533 position:33% line:89% align:start
[Both laugh]

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:09.604 position:21% line:83% align:start
I feel like you and I
haven't talked in a while,

00:16:09.737 --> 00:16:11.071 position:13% line:89% align:start
and I've really missed it.

00:16:13.942 --> 00:16:15.142 position:33% line:89% align:start
Yeah, me too.

00:16:16.109 --> 00:16:17.846 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
You took care of me all night?

00:16:18.445 --> 00:16:20.247 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Until I passed out, anyway.

00:16:20.815 --> 00:16:21.982 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I'm sorry.

00:16:22.115 --> 00:16:23.350 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
What are you sorry for now?

00:16:23.818 --> 00:16:25.419 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I just am.

00:16:26.220 --> 00:16:27.622 position:24% line:83% align:start
[Yuzuki chuckling]
I'm surprised

00:16:27.755 --> 00:16:29.691 position:24% line:83% align:start
you thought to look
for me under the bridge.

00:16:29.958 --> 00:16:32.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Well, at first
I figured there was no chance

00:16:32.392 --> 00:16:34.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
you'd do something as stupid
as I did.

00:16:35.630 --> 00:16:37.599 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I talked to Kurage,
and she said you were,

00:16:37.732 --> 00:16:39.801 position:16% line:83% align:start
and these are her words,
"a bumbling idiot."

00:16:39.934 --> 00:16:41.235 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
A bumbling idiot?

00:16:41.569 --> 00:16:43.671 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] You know, to be
perfectly honest with you,

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:46.139 position:24% line:83% align:start
that place carries
a lot of meaning for me.

00:16:47.642 --> 00:16:49.376 position:33% line:83% align:start
The first key
to achieving enlightenment

00:16:49.511 --> 00:16:52.680 position:44% line:83% align:start
is...
"No one should live alone."

00:16:54.248 --> 00:16:55.517 position:27% line:89% align:start
When I was a kid

00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
my father used to say that
all the time.

00:16:58.318 --> 00:16:59.687 position:27% line:83% align:start
But in his case,
it wasn't anything

00:16:59.821 --> 00:17:01.756 position:24% line:83% align:start
more than an excuse
to build a harem.

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:02.924 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:17:03.525 --> 00:17:05.860 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] In time,
I came to hate that phrase.

00:17:06.493 --> 00:17:08.897 position:35% line:83% align:start
So much so
that I promised myself

00:17:09.029 --> 00:17:10.430 position:24% line:89% align:start
I would live alone.

00:17:11.431 --> 00:17:13.333 position:24% line:83% align:start
But you put an end
to that idea.

00:17:15.537 --> 00:17:17.739 position:30% line:83% align:start
Down underneath
that fateful bridge,

00:17:18.138 --> 00:17:20.542 position:19% line:83% align:start
my entire world turned
upside-down.

00:17:23.377 --> 00:17:24.512 position:30% line:89% align:start
Please, Yuzuki

00:17:24.679 --> 00:17:26.748 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want you to include me
in your life.

00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:28.282 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Akagami.

00:17:29.149 --> 00:17:30.350 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
When I tried to be alone,

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:31.853 position:19% line:89% align:start
you refused to let me.

00:17:32.152 --> 00:17:33.387 position:19% line:89% align:start
So I can't sit back now

00:17:33.521 --> 00:17:35.322 position:33% line:83% align:start
and allow you
to do the same thing!

00:17:36.423 --> 00:17:38.258 position:21% line:83% align:start
That's why I'm asking
you to recognize me

00:17:38.392 --> 00:17:39.961 position:24% line:83% align:start
as one of the bonds
that you treasure.

00:17:40.093 --> 00:17:42.229 position:21% line:89% align:start
[Yuzuki sobs feebly]

00:17:42.396 --> 00:17:44.766 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] But you
shouldn't have to bear

00:17:44.899 --> 00:17:46.400 position:21% line:89% align:start
this responsibility.

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:48.570 position:16% line:89% align:start
This is only happening...

00:17:48.736 --> 00:17:51.839 position:38% line:83% align:start
[sobbing]
because I'm not good enough!

00:17:52.607 --> 00:17:55.142 position:21% line:83% align:start
But you haven't done
anything wrong, Akagami.

00:17:55.475 --> 00:17:58.278 position:13% line:83% align:start
You should be able to go do
whatever you want.

00:17:58.546 --> 00:18:00.648 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yet you're so busy
all the time.

00:18:01.883 --> 00:18:03.483 position:10% line:89% align:start
I cause you so much trouble.

00:18:03.618 --> 00:18:05.787 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm doing this
because I want to.

00:18:06.921 --> 00:18:08.523 position:13% line:89% align:start
Because I love this temple.

00:18:09.423 --> 00:18:11.325 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just like you love it, Yuzuki.

00:18:15.462 --> 00:18:19.634 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, it's because...I love
Mikazuki Temple.

00:18:21.636 --> 00:18:23.236 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I remember now.

00:18:25.773 --> 00:18:28.342 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could I forget
something so simple?

00:18:30.712 --> 00:18:31.746 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Akagami?

00:18:32.312 --> 00:18:33.514 position:35% line:89% align:start
Thank you.

00:18:34.281 --> 00:18:35.482 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:37.451 position:24% line:89% align:start
With all my heart.

00:18:40.187 --> 00:18:42.322 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
We overheard everything!

[Yuzuki screaming]

00:18:43.925 --> 00:18:45.392 position:16% line:89% align:start
How long were you there?!

00:18:45.627 --> 00:18:47.327 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just long enough to listen in

00:18:47.461 --> 00:18:49.664 position:33% line:83% align:start
while he put
one of these inside you.

00:18:49.797 --> 00:18:50.765 position:27% line:89% align:start
What did he do?!

00:18:50.898 --> 00:18:52.667 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I put nothing inside no one!

00:18:53.101 --> 00:18:54.535 position:33% line:89% align:start
Really, Yuzu.

Everybody here...
we all love Mikazuki Temple.

00:19:20.995 --> 00:19:24.197 position:7% line:83% align:start
So you have no right to exclude
us from helping you.

You guys.

00:19:26.634 --> 00:19:27.769 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Though, actually...

00:19:28.069 --> 00:19:30.071 position:24% line:83% align:start
on second thought,
maybe it's really you

00:19:30.203 --> 00:19:31.739 position:13% line:89% align:start
who's being excluded here.

Kiki.

00:19:49.289 --> 00:19:50.591 position:35% line:83% align:start
Um, Master.
I...

00:19:50.725 --> 00:19:54.294 position:27% line:83% align:start
Kiki...I get it.
I understand now.

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.497 position:33% line:83% align:start
I figured out
what I lost sight of...

00:19:58.666 --> 00:20:00.535 position:24% line:83% align:start
and why you stopped
my training.

00:20:02.036 --> 00:20:04.271 position:19% line:83% align:start
When I couldn't live up
to my mother,

00:20:04.772 --> 00:20:05.606 position:33% line:89% align:start
I panicked...

00:20:06.206 --> 00:20:08.710 position:19% line:83% align:start
and worried what others
were thinking about me.

Preserving everyone's
relationship with the temple.

So, please...

my training.

00:20:49.851 --> 00:20:51.652 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] The selfish
desire for recognition

00:20:51.786 --> 00:20:54.421 position:16% line:83% align:start
is the absolute farthest
one can possibly get

00:20:54.555 --> 00:20:56.356 position:10% line:89% align:start
from achieving enlightenment.

00:20:56.958 --> 00:20:58.025 position:21% line:89% align:start
Given time to think,

00:20:58.159 --> 00:21:00.327 position:13% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki came to an important
realization

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:02.930 position:19% line:83% align:start
about how a head priest
should truly be.

00:21:03.831 --> 00:21:04.866 position:33% line:89% align:start
That's that.

00:21:06.067 --> 00:21:07.568 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nothing to do with me.

00:21:08.401 --> 00:21:09.637 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:18.246 --> 00:21:19.914 position:27% line:83% align:start
Should you be up
and about already?

00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:22.817 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah.
My fever's gone down now.

00:21:23.718 --> 00:21:26.353 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've decided not to pursue
an outside job.

00:21:28.488 --> 00:21:29.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'm going to ask
our parishioners

00:21:29.924 --> 00:21:31.592 position:24% line:83% align:start
to offer donations
toward the repairs

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:32.960 position:16% line:89% align:start
on the principal figure.

00:21:33.961 --> 00:21:36.429 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] I'm not sure
they'll chip in so easily.

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.234 position:21% line:83% align:start
It may be difficult.
I agree with you.

00:21:40.768 --> 00:21:43.704 position:30% line:83% align:start
And that's why
I sacrificed myself,

00:21:43.971 --> 00:21:45.338 position:21% line:83% align:start
thinking that it was
the best way

00:21:45.472 --> 00:21:46.741 position:19% line:89% align:start
to protect the temple.

00:21:47.374 --> 00:21:48.408 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:21:48.876 --> 00:21:52.180 position:24% line:83% align:start
But I was so wrong.
When you obtain something

00:21:52.312 --> 00:21:56.150 position:7% line:83% align:start
through that kind of sacrifice,
it ends up being unsustainable.

[YUZUKI] The fifth key
to achieving enlightenment

00:22:00.154 --> 00:22:03.057 position:24% line:83% align:start
is, "Don't run away
from your weaknesses."

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:07.228 position:16% line:83% align:start
From this point on, we're
all going to work together.

00:22:07.695 --> 00:22:09.797 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's right. Well said.

Don't you worry.

00:23:32.513 --> 00:23:35.383 position:13% line:83% align:start
