By the way, Yuzuki.

00:00:10.512 --> 00:00:11.445 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:13.247 position:35% line:83% align:start
You appear
to be awfully relaxed,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.750 position:30% line:83% align:start
but what about
your matchmaking meeting?

00:00:15.884 --> 00:00:17.050 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's today, right?

00:00:17.184 --> 00:00:18.385 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.187 position:35% line:83% align:start
Isn't that
a pretty important meeting?

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
Like, the temple's future
depends on it?

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.926 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm going to be so late!

00:00:25.058 --> 00:00:26.628 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, where's the meeting?

00:00:26.761 --> 00:00:28.095 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ryukoku Temple.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.532 position:7% line:89% align:start
The truth is, as things stand,

00:00:30.665 --> 00:00:32.634 position:19% line:83% align:start
we're actually supposed
to move out of the temple

00:00:32.767 --> 00:00:33.902 position:21% line:89% align:start
as soon as possible.

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:35.102 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:36.270 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
My parents are priests,

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:37.939 position:5% line:89% align:start
but don't reside at the temple.

00:00:38.506 --> 00:00:40.608 position:27% line:83% align:start
And since there's
no head priest around,

00:00:40.742 --> 00:00:43.076 position:19% line:83% align:start
our family has no right
to live there.

00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:46.480 position:7% line:83% align:start
Unless this matchmaking meeting
is a big success,

00:00:46.614 --> 00:00:48.282 position:5% line:89% align:start
and a new head priest moves in!

00:00:48.716 --> 00:00:51.519 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wow. So you'd get married
just to save the temple?

00:00:51.653 --> 00:00:53.320 position:7% line:89% align:start
Are you really okay with that?

00:00:53.821 --> 00:00:56.189 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's my decision to make,
and no one else's.

00:00:56.558 --> 00:00:59.259 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm not going to allow
the temple to be closed!

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:11.706 position:16% line:89% align:start
I thought I could do it.

00:01:11.839 --> 00:01:13.140 position:27% line:89% align:start
Save the temple.

00:01:13.741 --> 00:01:15.275 position:16% line:89% align:start
But maybe it's hopeless.

00:01:17.712 --> 00:01:18.613 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:22.784 position:33% line:89% align:start
Huh? [gasps]

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.620 position:16% line:83% align:start
This is your opportunity
to change.

Huh?

00:01:27.087 --> 00:01:28.623 position:13% line:89% align:start
Your kimono, put it on now,

00:01:28.756 --> 00:01:30.792 position:24% line:83% align:start
and we'll get out
at the next light!

[YUZUKI]
But--

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.161 position:13% line:83% align:start
And we'll borrow this truck
to get where we're going!

00:01:34.294 --> 00:01:35.697 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's fine.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.899 position:13% line:83% align:start
As it happens, I used to be
a truck driver, too.

00:01:38.365 --> 00:01:39.466 position:35% line:89% align:start
Here we go!

Time to get this kimono on,

00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.737 position:38% line:83% align:start
and then
we'll break the door down!

it's going to take three years.

Right.

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:43.991 position:30% line:83% align:start

You're wearing work clothes,

[Yuzuki whimpers]

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:16.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
So, the matchmaker
was struck with a sudden illness

00:07:16.337 --> 00:07:17.838 position:7% line:89% align:start
and is sadly unable to attend.

00:07:17.972 --> 00:07:21.142 position:19% line:83% align:start
Therefore, I, Akagami,
will take their place.

is play Cupid for them.

What would you describe

00:07:42.096 --> 00:07:43.998 position:27% line:83% align:start
as an ideal date
with your sweetheart?

00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:46.466 position:44% line:83% align:start
Well,
I do like going to the movies.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.903 position:16% line:83% align:start
I've gotten used to going
by myself,

00:07:49.036 --> 00:07:51.105 position:33% line:83% align:start

having some company.

Things are progressing nicely!

Sitting together,

side by side
in a darkened theater?

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:05.453 position:27% line:89% align:start
How embarrassing.

I'm no demon.

How do you spend your days off?

Luxuriating at a hot springs.

Please,
don't you worry about me.

Alrighty then, milord.

What are your plans
for after you marry?

I've always imagined
having about ten kids.

Uh... I apologize.

00:08:57.405 --> 00:08:58.672 position:38% line:89% align:start
No need.

00:08:58.806 --> 00:09:00.741 position:16% line:83% align:start
It's clear your friends
are everything you said.

Huh?

what he was doing here,

00:09:05.246 --> 00:09:07.748 position:13% line:83% align:start
but I know he wasn't trying
to cause trouble.

00:09:08.682 --> 00:09:10.184 position:41% line:83% align:start
I have
a pretty good track record

00:09:10.317 --> 00:09:11.752 position:16% line:89% align:start
as a judge of character.

00:09:12.486 --> 00:09:14.622 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think your friend
just wanted to make sure

00:09:14.755 --> 00:09:16.123 position:30% line:89% align:start
you were okay.

[YUZUKI'S MOTHER]
Listen, Yuzuki.

00:09:24.565 --> 00:09:26.667 position:13% line:89% align:start
You must never tell a lie.

00:09:27.902 --> 00:09:29.437 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
That's right.

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:30.938 position:27% line:89% align:start
Never tell a lie.

00:09:31.672 --> 00:09:33.307 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is something the matter?

00:09:33.774 --> 00:09:35.943 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Kijo, I'm so sorry.

00:09:36.343 --> 00:09:41.282 position:21% line:83% align:start
You see, the truth is
I have no intention of marrying.

00:09:41.749 --> 00:09:43.417 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] So what you really want
is to find a man

00:09:43.552 --> 00:09:46.987 position:5% line:83% align:start
who can take over as head priest
of Mikazuki Temple?

00:09:47.121 --> 00:09:48.055 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:09:48.189 --> 00:09:49.690 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
And then you'll marry him?

00:09:49.824 --> 00:09:52.893 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know it's not exactly
straightforward.

00:09:53.027 --> 00:09:54.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
So what's the problem?

00:09:54.529 --> 00:09:56.597 position:7% line:89% align:start
Simply go through the motions.

00:09:57.064 --> 00:09:57.765 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:09:57.898 --> 00:09:59.033 position:30% line:89% align:start
[Kiki chuckles]

00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:01.902 position:21% line:83% align:start

till you can become a nun.

00:10:02.036 --> 00:10:03.538 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Uh, yes, but--

00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:05.172 position:16% line:89% align:start
[KIKI] We'll tell people

00:10:05.306 --> 00:10:07.274 position:7% line:83% align:start
your fiance will be taking over
after you're married.

00:10:07.408 --> 00:10:10.311 position:16% line:83% align:start
You get yourself engaged,
drag it out for three years,

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:11.445 position:19% line:89% align:start
and then break it off.

00:10:11.580 --> 00:10:12.514 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Mm...

00:10:12.646 --> 00:10:14.482 position:5% line:89% align:start
Sounds like we're scamming him.

00:10:14.615 --> 00:10:15.550 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nonsense!

00:10:15.683 --> 00:10:17.017 position:13% line:89% align:start
He gets to live the fantasy

00:10:17.151 --> 00:10:18.853 position:27% line:83% align:start
of being engaged
to a beautiful young woman.

00:10:18.986 --> 00:10:20.788 position:19% line:89% align:start
So a total scam, then.

00:10:20.921 --> 00:10:22.356 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
If you end up really liking him,

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:24.792 position:7% line:83% align:start
then you can always go through
with the wedding.

00:10:24.925 --> 00:10:26.760 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] What if he wants
to get married sooner?

[KIKI]

Fob him off
with some line like that.

00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:33.602 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:36.370 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
I'll give it my best shot.

00:10:36.505 --> 00:10:38.540 position:10% line:89% align:start
Well said! That's the spirit.

00:10:39.006 --> 00:10:41.375 position:41% line:83% align:start
Go find
some poor slob of a priest

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.077 position:13% line:89% align:start
and string the loser along!

something against priests?

-Mm...
-[HOAN] I understand.

00:10:48.883 --> 00:10:50.985 position:38% line:83% align:start
So then,
what you're really after

00:10:51.118 --> 00:10:53.555 position:19% line:83% align:start
is someone to help you
keep your temple open.

00:10:53.687 --> 00:10:54.623 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Yes.

00:10:55.289 --> 00:10:57.791 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] And that's the reason
you hired a matchmaker.

00:10:57.925 --> 00:10:59.493 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm truly sorry.

00:10:59.628 --> 00:11:01.962 position:13% line:83% align:start
I just couldn't lie to you
anymore.

00:11:02.763 --> 00:11:03.831 position:38% line:89% align:start
Please...

00:11:04.732 --> 00:11:06.033 position:19% line:83% align:start
I know I have no right
to ask this,

00:11:06.167 --> 00:11:09.003 position:10% line:83% align:start
but would you still consider
an engagement?

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:11.405 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[inhales]
-[YUZUKI] If you did, I--

00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:13.240 position:5% line:89% align:start
We'd have all the time we need!

00:11:14.041 --> 00:11:16.010 position:5% line:89% align:start
You're an awfully direct person.

00:11:16.143 --> 00:11:18.879 position:33% line:83% align:start
I like that.
It's very endearing.

00:11:19.446 --> 00:11:21.215 position:19% line:89% align:start
But you're also young.

00:11:22.082 --> 00:11:24.485 position:5% line:89% align:start
And based on everything I hear,

00:11:24.619 --> 00:11:25.886 position:30% line:89% align:start
Mikazuki Temple

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:27.988 position:21% line:83% align:start
is perpetually broke
and understaffed.

00:11:28.122 --> 00:11:29.390 position:24% line:89% align:start
And the main temple

00:11:29.524 --> 00:11:31.560 position:21% line:83% align:start
is in desperate need
of some repair work.

00:11:31.692 --> 00:11:32.860 position:41% line:89% align:start
But I--

00:11:32.993 --> 00:11:33.961 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HOAN]
Do you think you'll be able

00:11:34.094 --> 00:11:35.763 position:10% line:89% align:start
to satisfy your parishioners?

00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:37.731 position:33% line:83% align:start
If you can't
take care of yourself,

00:11:37.865 --> 00:11:39.568 position:7% line:89% align:start
then how will you save others?

-[whimpers]
-[HOAN] In the long run,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.872 position:7% line:83% align:start
keeping that temple open isn't
going to make anyone happy.

00:11:45.005 --> 00:11:46.974 position:19% line:83% align:start
I can't be the only one
who's had that thought,

00:11:47.107 --> 00:11:49.877 position:5% line:83% align:start
or else it wouldn't be in danger
of being shut down.

00:11:51.712 --> 00:11:52.880 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I hear you.

00:11:53.948 --> 00:11:55.149 position:33% line:89% align:start
But they're--

00:11:55.282 --> 00:11:56.483 position:30% line:89% align:start
Ah, it's not--

00:11:56.618 --> 00:11:58.319 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HOAN]
Try to understand.

00:12:00.522 --> 00:12:04.124 position:19% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] Mikazuki Temple
isn't worth protecting.

00:12:05.192 --> 00:12:08.095 position:7% line:89% align:start
Still, I'm going to take over!

00:12:08.563 --> 00:12:09.797 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.099 position:30% line:83% align:start
To think things
were as dire as this,

00:12:12.233 --> 00:12:14.768 position:33% line:83% align:start
and it's all
because of my family's debt.

At this point,

00:12:16.203 --> 00:12:17.606 position:24% line:83% align:start
the least I can do
is give my life

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.877 position:24% line:89% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Milord,

00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:26.280 position:24% line:83% align:start
might you grant us
a second chance at this meeting?

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:29.750 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's Akagami, wasn't it?

00:12:30.518 --> 00:12:32.386 position:33% line:83% align:start
If the temple
were to be shut down,

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.455 position:33% line:83% align:start
that would be
to your benefit as well.

00:12:34.589 --> 00:12:35.923 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:12:36.056 --> 00:12:37.825 position:7% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] Your service obligation
would be over.

00:12:37.958 --> 00:12:40.294 position:16% line:83% align:start
You'd be able to pay off
your debt over time,

00:12:40.427 --> 00:12:41.362 position:33% line:89% align:start
comfortably.

00:12:41.495 --> 00:12:42.564 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
He's right.

00:12:42.697 --> 00:12:44.431 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's good for Akagami, too.

00:12:45.432 --> 00:12:48.503 position:35% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] Now,
I believe this meeting is over.

00:12:51.539 --> 00:12:54.576 position:41% line:83% align:start
Listen.
Mikazuki Temple isn't needed.

00:12:54.709 --> 00:12:56.010 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
You're wrong.

00:12:56.143 --> 00:12:59.413 position:30% line:83% align:start
Twice already,
that temple and Yuzuki saved me.

00:12:59.547 --> 00:13:00.414 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akagami.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:03.551 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Mikazuki Temple isn't worthless.

00:13:03.685 --> 00:13:05.587 position:10% line:89% align:start
It serves a valuable purpose.

00:13:06.387 --> 00:13:08.455 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HOAN]
You feel it should stay open?

00:13:08.989 --> 00:13:10.324 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
I do.

00:13:10.457 --> 00:13:13.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
Know this, Yuzuki will
likely suffer greatly.

00:13:13.728 --> 00:13:16.130 position:30% line:83% align:start
The challenges
of running a temple are many,

00:13:16.263 --> 00:13:18.098 position:24% line:83% align:start
and her suffering
will be compounded

00:13:18.232 --> 00:13:20.502 position:21% line:83% align:start
by that of her family
and parishioners.

00:13:20.635 --> 00:13:21.770 position:33% line:89% align:start
She may fail.

00:13:21.902 --> 00:13:23.404 position:30% line:83% align:start
Things may get
a whole lot worse.

00:13:23.538 --> 00:13:27.141 position:16% line:83% align:start
What do you intend to do
when she can't take it anymore?

00:13:27.274 --> 00:13:27.875 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:13:28.008 --> 00:13:29.376 position:24% line:89% align:start
I will support her.

00:13:30.745 --> 00:13:31.646 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:32.313 --> 00:13:35.550 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HOAN]
Oh? And do you really mean that?

00:13:35.684 --> 00:13:36.950 position:24% line:89% align:start
From this point on,

00:13:37.084 --> 00:13:38.952 position:38% line:83% align:start
you swear
you'll make Yuzuki Aoba happy?

00:13:39.086 --> 00:13:40.722 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Hm?
-I do!

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.356 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:45.359 position:5% line:83% align:start
You promise you'll stay with her
in sickness and in health?

00:13:45.492 --> 00:13:46.960 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Eh?
-I do!

00:13:47.094 --> 00:13:48.763 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey! Wait! [whimpering]

00:13:48.896 --> 00:13:50.665 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HOAN]
You vow to care for each other

00:13:50.799 --> 00:13:52.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
and build
a bright and happy future

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:54.001 position:27% line:89% align:start
with your family?

00:13:54.134 --> 00:13:56.303 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[AKEMITSU] I do!
-Ah, where is this going?

00:13:57.304 --> 00:14:01.075 position:30% line:83% align:start
Show me, then,
the value of that temple.

00:14:01.743 --> 00:14:04.244 position:35% line:83% align:start
Prove to me
that the ideals of children

00:14:04.378 --> 00:14:07.314 position:33% line:83% align:start
can overcome
the harshness of reality.

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:11.151 position:19% line:89% align:start
Very well, Yuzuki Aoba.

00:14:11.586 --> 00:14:12.821 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah! Yeah?

00:14:13.454 --> 00:14:15.824 position:24% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] I'm willing
to accept your proposal.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:16.957 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:14:17.091 --> 00:14:19.226 position:38% line:83% align:start
However,
I'm lending you my name.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:20.294 position:38% line:89% align:start
No more.

00:14:22.630 --> 00:14:24.298 position:24% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI, AKEMITSU]
Thank you so much!

-[HOAN] Hm?

00:14:31.305 --> 00:14:32.873 position:21% line:83% align:start
I thought I asked you
to convince her

00:14:33.006 --> 00:14:35.008 position:13% line:83% align:start
that shuttering the temple
was for the best.

00:14:35.744 --> 00:14:38.513 position:16% line:83% align:start
She brought a strange boy
with her. Threw me.

00:14:39.413 --> 00:14:41.415 position:13% line:83% align:start
You must have been curious
about him, too.

00:14:41.549 --> 00:14:43.785 position:7% line:83% align:start
Or you wouldn't have pulled him
into the meeting.

00:14:44.251 --> 00:14:46.920 position:13% line:89% align:start
Correct, High Priest Aoba?

[AKEMITSU]
Eh, no big deal.

00:15:02.269 --> 00:15:04.204 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't mind
walking to the station.

00:15:05.906 --> 00:15:07.675 position:38% line:83% align:start

Hey, I'm really sorry.

00:15:07.809 --> 00:15:08.877 position:35% line:83% align:start

For what?

00:15:09.009 --> 00:15:09.977 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Never mind.

00:15:10.110 --> 00:15:11.345 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Okay, then.

00:15:11.478 --> 00:15:13.648 position:5% line:83% align:start
I'm glad the matchmaking meeting
went well.

00:15:14.181 --> 00:15:15.449 position:13% line:89% align:start
So you're getting engaged,

00:15:15.583 --> 00:15:17.552 position:21% line:83% align:start
but not going through
with the marriage.

00:15:17.685 --> 00:15:19.319 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ah, does that mean

00:15:19.453 --> 00:15:22.055 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm not going to have to move
out of the temple after all?

00:15:22.189 --> 00:15:23.558 position:21% line:89% align:start
Of course, you won't.

Why, oh, why must you provoke
my worldly desires?

[AKEMITSU] She made

Yup.

Could it be the real reason

00:19:29.937 --> 00:19:32.305 position:24% line:83% align:start
she so generously
let me bathe first

00:19:32.439 --> 00:19:33.908 position:10% line:47% align:start
was to get me out of the way?

You totally nailed it, Akagami.

what she's hoping for, right?
