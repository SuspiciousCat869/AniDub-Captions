00:00:13.681 --> 00:00:16.651 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hm. Yuzuki.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:19.453 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[YUZUKI] We're home!
-[gasps]

00:00:19.587 --> 00:00:20.788 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's about time!

00:00:20.922 --> 00:00:22.222 position:7% line:89% align:start
You two were out way too late!

00:00:22.356 --> 00:00:23.858 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
Well, we're back now.

00:00:23.992 --> 00:00:27.127 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sighs] You should've called
to tell us where you were!

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:28.462 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that's my bad.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:30.464 position:10% line:83% align:start
My phone died before I could,
so...

00:00:30.698 --> 00:00:33.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
Eh, don't worry.
I'm just glad nothing happened.

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] Of course, nothing
happened between the two of us.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:38.540 position:38% line:83% align:start
[shouts]
What did you do?

00:02:10.798 --> 00:02:12.100 position:33% line:89% align:start
[door opens]

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:13.968 position:21% line:89% align:start
See you after school!

00:02:14.535 --> 00:02:16.871 position:16% line:83% align:start
Dude. I was up all night
playing games.

00:02:17.005 --> 00:02:21.375 position:10% line:83% align:start
So, you two stayed the night
at a lo-- a love hotel

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:22.744 position:24% line:83% align:start
because you missed
the last train,

00:02:22.877 --> 00:02:24.612 position:13% line:83% align:start
but you didn't do anything,
right?

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:26.781 position:7% line:89% align:start
Exactly. All we did was sleep.

00:02:26.914 --> 00:02:28.082 position:30% line:89% align:start
What a relief.

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:29.550 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckles]
I was starting to think

00:02:29.684 --> 00:02:31.753 position:27% line:83% align:start
you had an affair
on the same day you got engaged!

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:33.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
Did you really think
I would do that?

00:02:33.755 --> 00:02:35.623 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
But now that I think of it,

00:02:35.757 --> 00:02:36.958 position:27% line:89% align:start
let's be careful.

00:02:37.091 --> 00:02:39.259 position:16% line:83% align:start
We shouldn't tell anyone
at school about that night,

00:02:39.393 --> 00:02:41.129 position:30% line:83% align:start
or that Akagami
is living with us.

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:43.430 position:47% line:83% align:start
Ah!
But isn't it normal for temples

00:02:43.564 --> 00:02:45.499 position:30% line:83% align:start
to have workers
live on the premises?

00:02:45.633 --> 00:02:48.201 position:10% line:83% align:start
I feel like you've forgotten
that we're a nunnery.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:49.904 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
I don't think it's a big deal.

00:02:50.038 --> 00:02:51.271 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
It's a huge deal!

00:02:51.405 --> 00:02:52.840 position:24% line:83% align:start
If people find out
we live with a man,

00:02:52.974 --> 00:02:55.475 position:16% line:83% align:start
-they'll start to think--
-But Akagami's totally harmless.

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.344 position:21% line:83% align:start
I mean, when we were
in the love hotel together,

00:02:57.477 --> 00:02:59.647 position:35% line:83% align:start
-he-- Huh?
-Stop right there! Whatever.

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:02.817 position:5% line:83% align:start
I just don't want anyone to know
about him living with us.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.052 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it?

00:03:04.217 --> 00:03:06.386 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure.

00:03:08.022 --> 00:03:11.125 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MALE STUDENT] "Man, that test
was harder than I expected!"

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.727 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Come on,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.461 position:10% line:83% align:start
you shouldn't let your guard
down around him.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:16.296 position:16% line:83% align:start
Before he started living
with us,

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.966 position:7% line:89% align:start
you were, I thought you were...

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.169 position:24% line:89% align:start
[students chatter]

00:03:21.301 --> 00:03:22.737 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[MANA] Tsukki.
-Huh?

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:26.841 position:35% line:83% align:start
-What's up?
-[TSUKUYO] Hey, Mana. Hey, Yuki.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.341 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Morning.
-What's wrong?

00:03:28.475 --> 00:03:29.644 position:10% line:89% align:start
You're looking a little off.

00:03:29.777 --> 00:03:32.212 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, just some stuff
going on at home.

00:03:32.345 --> 00:03:33.748 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[sipping]
-[MANA] With the temple?

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:35.783 position:41% line:83% align:start
Ah, now
that we're talking about that,

00:03:35.917 --> 00:03:38.886 position:41% line:83% align:start
Tsukki,
I hear you got a boyfriend.

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.253 position:38% line:89% align:start
[retches]

00:03:40.387 --> 00:03:41.556 position:35% line:89% align:start
[coughing]

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:43.024 position:16% line:89% align:start
Well, you've heard wrong!

00:03:43.157 --> 00:03:45.126 position:27% line:83% align:start
Where did you get
that idea anyway?

00:03:45.258 --> 00:03:46.961 position:10% line:89% align:start
From an eyewitness testimony!

00:03:47.095 --> 00:03:48.361 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's that supposed to mean?

00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:50.230 position:13% line:83% align:start
You were seen kissing a boy
by the river

00:03:50.363 --> 00:03:51.632 position:19% line:89% align:start
after the rain stopped!

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:53.768 position:16% line:83% align:start
And you brought him home
with you afterwards!

00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:54.969 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Girl!
-Girl!

00:03:55.636 --> 00:03:58.172 position:33% line:83% align:start
Afraid to say
you've got the wrong person.

00:03:58.305 --> 00:03:59.574 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MANA]
You can't get off like that!

00:03:59.707 --> 00:04:01.341 position:7% line:89% align:start
He was wearing temple clothes!

00:04:01.475 --> 00:04:02.877 position:35% line:89% align:start
Was he now?

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.680 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.449 position:41% line:83% align:start
Oh, no!
You've got the wrong idea!

00:04:09.584 --> 00:04:11.485 position:33% line:83% align:start
The two of us
weren't alone down there.

00:04:11.619 --> 00:04:12.787 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki was with us!

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.956 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wow! So, it was
in front of your sister?

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:16.791 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
I told you, it's not like that!

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:19.227 position:7% line:83% align:start
I just had to whisper something
in his ear!

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.695 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MANA]
What was it?

00:04:20.828 --> 00:04:23.497 position:7% line:83% align:start
Nothing! We had kissed earlier,
and... Ugh.

00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:25.900 position:19% line:89% align:start
So, you kissed already?

00:04:26.033 --> 00:04:27.334 position:13% line:89% align:start
Congrats on the boyfriend!

00:04:27.467 --> 00:04:29.203 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Tell us more about him!
-Hold on!

00:04:29.336 --> 00:04:30.303 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's not my, uh... Uh.

00:04:30.437 --> 00:04:32.439 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're the talk of the school!

00:04:32.573 --> 00:04:34.307 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Oh, for sure.
-Huh?

00:04:34.609 --> 00:04:36.644 position:7% line:83% align:start
[MANA] There are a ton of boys
who're interested in you!

00:04:36.778 --> 00:04:39.379 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Wait, you're kidding, right?

00:04:39.847 --> 00:04:41.549 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MANA]
You've never realized it,

00:04:41.682 --> 00:04:44.018 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you Aoba sisters
have quite the following

00:04:44.152 --> 00:04:45.418 position:19% line:89% align:start
amongst our classmates!

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:48.222 position:21% line:83% align:start
Your sister's famous
for what a knock out she is,

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:50.925 position:21% line:89% align:start
and you are stacked.

00:04:51.058 --> 00:04:52.492 position:41% line:83% align:start
[YUKI]
Like none other!

00:04:52.627 --> 00:04:54.095 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
That's not a big deal!

00:04:54.228 --> 00:04:56.664 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MANA] There's only one thing
on people's minds lately,

00:04:56.798 --> 00:04:59.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
and that's wanting
to know more about your boy!

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.134 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
What?

00:05:00.268 --> 00:05:01.536 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Spill the tea!

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:02.737 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Spill the tea!
-[TSUKUYO] This is bad.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:04.337 position:16% line:83% align:start
If they find out he lives
with us,

00:05:04.471 --> 00:05:06.040 position:21% line:83% align:start
we'll be even deeper
in this mess!

00:05:06.174 --> 00:05:07.208 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Spill the tea!

00:05:07.942 --> 00:05:09.710 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[shrieks]
-[MANA, YUKI] Are you okay?

00:05:09.844 --> 00:05:11.012 position:10% line:83% align:start
-She's like some kinda ninja!
-[TSUKUYO] What's he doing,

00:05:11.145 --> 00:05:12.412 position:27% line:89% align:start
coming to school?

00:05:12.547 --> 00:05:15.382 position:16% line:83% align:start
And in his work clothes,
of all things.

00:05:15.917 --> 00:05:17.084 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:20.621 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] He's here
because of my mistake!

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:22.523 position:5% line:89% align:start
I'm going to the nurse's office!

00:05:22.657 --> 00:05:23.858 position:41% line:83% align:start
[YUKI]
She's off!

00:05:23.991 --> 00:05:25.059 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MANA]
You seem pretty healthy to me!

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.995 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you know
where I could find Tsukuyo Aoba?

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:30.497 position:13% line:89% align:start
Uh, probably in class, now.

00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:32.432 position:35% line:83% align:start
Do you mind
if I ask who you are?

00:05:32.567 --> 00:05:34.434 position:10% line:89% align:start
Oh, how terribly rude of me.

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:37.305 position:19% line:83% align:start
I came here to deliver
Tsukuyo's lunch to her.

00:05:37.437 --> 00:05:38.940 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'm Akaga... [choked]

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:40.675 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:05:41.776 --> 00:05:43.376 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

[groans]

00:05:47.782 --> 00:05:50.450 position:16% line:89% align:start
[gasps] Huh? Where am I?

00:05:50.585 --> 00:05:51.953 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
You're finally awake.

00:05:52.385 --> 00:05:53.621 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:05:53.754 --> 00:05:56.290 position:19% line:89% align:start
Shush. Relax. It's me!

00:05:56.423 --> 00:05:59.193 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why are we here?
And where is "here?"

00:05:59.327 --> 00:06:00.493 position:24% line:89% align:start
The nurse's office.

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.129 position:38% line:83% align:start
The nurse
doesn't start her shift

00:06:02.263 --> 00:06:04.198 position:16% line:83% align:start
-for the day until later.
-Oh.

00:06:04.899 --> 00:06:06.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
You forgot your lunch at home.

00:06:06.667 --> 00:06:09.904 position:21% line:83% align:start
Listen. This is nice,
but you can't just show up here.

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:11.939 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
All right, I'll be off then.

00:06:12.073 --> 00:06:13.741 position:30% line:89% align:start
Agh! Slow down.

00:06:13.875 --> 00:06:15.977 position:13% line:83% align:start
You can't go outside while
everyone's in the middle of PE!

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:17.612 position:38% line:83% align:start
Somebody
will definitely notice you!

00:06:17.745 --> 00:06:18.846 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Is that a problem if they do?

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.314 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
A massive problem!

00:06:20.447 --> 00:06:21.649 position:30% line:83% align:start
You're wearing
your work clothes!

00:06:21.782 --> 00:06:23.084 position:7% line:89% align:start
What should I have worn, then?

00:06:23.217 --> 00:06:25.353 position:30% line:83% align:start
I figured this
was the least suspicious option.

00:06:25.485 --> 00:06:28.856 position:21% line:83% align:start
Maybe any other day.
But not after what's happened.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.025 position:24% line:83% align:start
For the time being,
you'll have to hide in here.

[knock at door]

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:34.962 position:27% line:83% align:start

Yeah,
it isn't any big deal though.

The bigger problem is he went
straight up my clothes!

Huh?

00:12:41.328 --> 00:12:45.332 position:10% line:83% align:start
Really? I turned my brain off
and auto-piloted here.

00:12:50.237 --> 00:12:51.305 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

Sheesh. They did
an awful job cleaning up.

00:12:55.342 --> 00:12:58.912 position:5% line:83% align:start
Ugh, this is not the correct way
to string a bow!

00:13:00.814 --> 00:13:02.617 position:41% line:89% align:start
Hm. Mm?

Why did you run away?

00:13:47.961 --> 00:13:49.163 position:33% line:89% align:start
Just 'cause.

00:13:49.296 --> 00:13:50.931 position:7% line:83% align:start
I didn't want any of the girls
at school

Were you thinking

00:13:54.168 --> 00:13:55.903 position:30% line:83% align:start
about returning
to the archery club?

00:13:56.036 --> 00:13:58.372 position:24% line:83% align:start
I already told you,
it's not happening.

But why? I saw the way
you looked back there.

00:14:02.443 --> 00:14:04.612 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you were having fun!

[TSUKUYO]
There's your reason.

00:14:11.519 --> 00:14:14.488 position:19% line:83% align:start
Because it's only fun.
That's it.

00:14:16.691 --> 00:14:18.092 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's not like I'm talented.

00:14:18.225 --> 00:14:20.861 position:21% line:83% align:start
I was never doing it
with the intent to improve.

00:14:20.994 --> 00:14:22.363 position:21% line:89% align:start
When I first started,

00:14:22.496 --> 00:14:25.265 position:24% line:83% align:start
my only reason was
because Yuzuki was doing it.

00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:31.939 position:33% line:83% align:start
She's the one
who should go back to archery.

00:14:32.072 --> 00:14:34.441 position:24% line:83% align:start
How could I return
before she does?

00:14:35.142 --> 00:14:37.244 position:16% line:83% align:start
She was way better at it
than me.

00:14:37.846 --> 00:14:39.880 position:16% line:89% align:start
Everyone loved her, too.

00:14:40.782 --> 00:14:42.383 position:19% line:89% align:start
But she gave it all up.

00:14:43.718 --> 00:14:46.721 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki's been pushing herself
so hard for our sake!

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:49.758 position:16% line:83% align:start
It would be selfish of me
to go back without her!

00:14:49.890 --> 00:14:51.826 position:7% line:89% align:start
Think of how difficult this is!

00:14:51.959 --> 00:14:53.828 position:19% line:83% align:start
She's running a temple
at her age?

00:14:54.128 --> 00:14:57.131 position:10% line:83% align:start
She's had to grow up so fast!
And a matchmaker?

00:14:57.264 --> 00:14:59.199 position:5% line:89% align:start
We're still only high schoolers!

00:15:03.036 --> 00:15:05.205 position:7% line:89% align:start
I could never do what she does.

00:15:05.339 --> 00:15:07.675 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's in a league
all by herself.

-Huh?

00:15:12.246 --> 00:15:14.014 position:10% line:89% align:start
So, let me get this straight.

00:15:14.148 --> 00:15:15.416 position:21% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki is suffering,

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:17.251 position:24% line:83% align:start
and since you think
that's why she quit,

00:15:17.384 --> 00:15:19.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
you've forbidden yourself
from enjoying the archery club?

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.122 position:44% line:83% align:start
Yeah.
What's your point, wise guy?

00:15:22.256 --> 00:15:24.626 position:35% line:83% align:start
Follow me.
You've gotta see this.

00:15:24.759 --> 00:15:26.226 position:38% line:89% align:start
See what?

00:15:28.730 --> 00:15:31.031 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:34.435 position:33% line:83% align:start
-We're here.
-Hm?

00:15:35.335 --> 00:15:36.970 position:7% line:89% align:start
We're just back at the temple.

Wh-- What's this?

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:57.991 position:35% line:83% align:start
You told me
that Yuzuki's suffering...

00:15:58.726 --> 00:16:00.461 position:30% line:83% align:start
so I wanted you
to take a close look

00:16:00.595 --> 00:16:02.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
and see if your sister's
really suffering

00:16:02.329 --> 00:16:04.131 position:13% line:89% align:start
as badly as you say she is.

00:16:05.199 --> 00:16:06.868 position:21% line:89% align:start
This is our reality.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.704 position:7% line:89% align:start
Look at her, bow still in hand.

00:16:11.906 --> 00:16:14.174 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
No. I can't watch.

00:16:14.308 --> 00:16:16.210 position:13% line:89% align:start
She has the same elegance.

00:16:16.343 --> 00:16:19.279 position:16% line:83% align:start
The image of perfection,
that profile.

[inhales]

00:16:33.895 --> 00:16:35.563 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:16:35.697 --> 00:16:36.731 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is the truth

00:16:36.865 --> 00:16:38.700 position:19% line:83% align:start
that you've kept hidden
from yourself.

00:16:38.833 --> 00:16:40.334 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki wasn't talented,

00:16:40.467 --> 00:16:42.436 position:13% line:83% align:start
but your guilt transformed
the memory of her

00:16:42.570 --> 00:16:44.338 position:30% line:83% align:start
into something
you wanted to see.

00:16:44.471 --> 00:16:45.840 position:38% line:89% align:start
Ah! Stop!

00:16:45.974 --> 00:16:47.675 position:24% line:89% align:start

-Um?

00:16:49.611 --> 00:16:51.311 position:35% line:83% align:start
That's why
I didn't want to see this!

00:16:51.445 --> 00:16:53.280 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why do you have
to be such a jerk?

00:16:53.413 --> 00:16:56.818 position:13% line:83% align:start
Seeing how elegant she was
makes me wanna do archery again!

00:16:56.951 --> 00:16:58.853 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] You have
to get ahold of yourself!

What were you even looking at?

00:17:00.387 --> 00:17:02.590 position:19% line:83% align:start
You just saw a meathead
perform so poorly

00:17:02.724 --> 00:17:05.125 position:16% line:83% align:start
it can only be explained
by divine providence!

00:17:05.259 --> 00:17:06.661 position:7% line:89% align:start
How is that the best she can do

00:17:06.794 --> 00:17:08.997 position:13% line:83% align:start
after spending over a year
practicing technique?

00:17:09.129 --> 00:17:11.733 position:27% line:83% align:start
You could afford
to talk a little quieter!

00:17:12.232 --> 00:17:13.568 position:21% line:89% align:start
Look, I know I'm bad.

00:17:13.701 --> 00:17:16.036 position:41% line:83% align:start
I mean,
why do you think I gave up?

00:17:16.169 --> 00:17:17.805 position:21% line:83% align:start
I've always struggled
with my aim.

00:17:17.939 --> 00:17:19.607 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's putting it mildly.

Don't worry about it, Yuzuki!

00:17:27.815 --> 00:17:29.383 position:21% line:89% align:start
Mia, some restraint.

00:17:29.584 --> 00:17:33.220 position:24% line:83% align:start
No! I'll try again!
That was a practice shot!

00:17:37.592 --> 00:17:40.962 position:7% line:83% align:start
What? You don't have any talent
for archery?

00:17:41.094 --> 00:17:44.032 position:10% line:83% align:start
And you didn't quit the club
because of the temple?

00:17:44.164 --> 00:17:45.132 position:38% line:89% align:start
For real?

00:17:45.265 --> 00:17:47.835 position:10% line:89% align:start
Uh, yeah. I thought you knew.

00:17:48.268 --> 00:17:50.337 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
So then, why did I think...

00:17:50.905 --> 00:17:53.373 position:5% line:83% align:start
'Cause you went full horny-brain
over your sister

00:17:53.508 --> 00:17:54.776 position:10% line:89% align:start
and stopped paying attention.

00:17:54.909 --> 00:17:56.376 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Take that back!

00:17:56.511 --> 00:17:58.713 position:21% line:89% align:start
Hm? What's that mean?

00:17:58.846 --> 00:18:00.548 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] It means
the sight of your profile

00:18:00.682 --> 00:18:02.650 position:13% line:83% align:start
while you're holding a bow
is too much for her,

00:18:02.784 --> 00:18:04.686 position:24% line:83% align:start
so her brain turns
into mush every time

00:18:04.819 --> 00:18:06.320 position:19% line:89% align:start
she thinks back to it.

Please, just shut up!

Let's change the topic, Yuzuki!

00:18:14.696 --> 00:18:17.331 position:7% line:89% align:start
Is the way you live still fun?

00:18:17.464 --> 00:18:20.434 position:41% line:83% align:start
Mm-hm.
Every day here has been fun.

00:18:20.568 --> 00:18:23.004 position:27% line:83% align:start
Running a temple
hasn't been an easy task,

00:18:23.136 --> 00:18:24.806 position:27% line:83% align:start
but it's nothing
if not fulfilling.

00:18:24.939 --> 00:18:28.042 position:5% line:83% align:start
I realized this is what I really
feel called to do in life.

whatever you want as well.

Don't fret over family stuff.

00:18:34.348 --> 00:18:35.883 position:13% line:89% align:start
Though, there is one thing.

Hm?

00:18:37.184 --> 00:18:38.586 position:13% line:89% align:start
If you ever have the time,

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:41.121 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd appreciate some lessons

On the day that Yuzuki quit,
she was smiling.

I think I've earned a bath.

00:19:13.353 --> 00:19:14.421 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:19:14.822 --> 00:19:15.957 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:16.090 --> 00:19:18.960 position:19% line:89% align:start
My bad. I saw it again.

00:19:19.093 --> 00:19:20.662 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
No! I'm sorry!

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:22.429 position:24% line:89% align:start
[Tsukuyo laughing]

00:19:22.563 --> 00:19:24.565 position:13% line:89% align:start
This keeps happening to us.

00:19:24.699 --> 00:19:26.466 position:13% line:89% align:start
We should be more careful!

00:19:26.768 --> 00:19:28.936 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Honestly, I feel terrible.

00:19:29.070 --> 00:19:30.104 position:24% line:89% align:start
I was rude earlier.

00:19:30.237 --> 00:19:32.540 position:19% line:89% align:start
[chuckle] You're okay.

00:19:33.708 --> 00:19:35.242 position:7% line:89% align:start
On that note, I have an update.

00:19:35.375 --> 00:19:36.944 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Oh?

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:39.379 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've decided that it's time
to return to the archery club,

00:19:39.514 --> 00:19:43.685 position:10% line:83% align:start
and it's all because of you.
So thank you, I guess.

00:19:43.818 --> 00:19:46.688 position:27% line:83% align:start
Glad to hear it.
I think it'll be good for you.

00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:49.791 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hey, so let me ask you.

00:19:49.924 --> 00:19:52.760 position:21% line:83% align:start
Why did you go so far
out of your way to help me?

00:19:53.628 --> 00:19:56.564 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] I guess
the whole thing made me upset.

00:19:56.964 --> 00:19:58.331 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:58.465 --> 00:19:59.734 position:10% line:83% align:start
You felt like you couldn't do
what you wanted

00:19:59.867 --> 00:20:01.869 position:30% line:83% align:start
because of your
family's circumstances.

00:20:02.436 --> 00:20:04.471 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think it all rang
a little too close to home

00:20:04.605 --> 00:20:05.773 position:7% line:89% align:start
after everything I've given up

00:20:05.907 --> 00:20:08.275 position:19% line:83% align:start
because of the Akagami
family name.

00:20:09.409 --> 00:20:10.978 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Does that have anything to do

00:20:11.112 --> 00:20:13.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
with why you came here
in the first place?

00:20:13.346 --> 00:20:15.583 position:19% line:89% align:start
[chuckles] Maybe a bit.

00:20:16.551 --> 00:20:18.086 position:5% line:89% align:start
But that's not what's important.

00:20:18.519 --> 00:20:20.822 position:41% line:83% align:start
I think
I just wanted to see you happy,

00:20:20.955 --> 00:20:22.289 position:35% line:89% align:start
that's all.

00:20:24.926 --> 00:20:26.961 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hm? Hold on.

00:20:27.095 --> 00:20:28.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm not done changing.

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:30.698 position:13% line:83% align:start
You know, it's still on me,
clear as day.

00:20:30.832 --> 00:20:32.867 position:41% line:83% align:start
-That--
-You gave me a hickey

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.069 position:16% line:83% align:start
back when we were trapped
in the nurse's office.

00:20:35.203 --> 00:20:36.470 position:44% line:89% align:start
Agh!

00:20:36.604 --> 00:20:38.172 position:21% line:83% align:start
How shall I make you
take responsibility

00:20:38.305 --> 00:20:39.607 position:21% line:83% align:start
-for this mark on me?
-Uh.

00:20:39.741 --> 00:20:41.341 position:13% line:89% align:start
Just name it and it's done.

00:20:41.475 --> 00:20:43.111 position:5% line:89% align:start
Should I raise how much you owe?

00:20:43.243 --> 00:20:44.512 position:30% line:89% align:start
Anything else!

00:20:44.645 --> 00:20:45.947 position:35% line:83% align:start
All right,
then stand up straight for me.

00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.181 position:41% line:89% align:start
Ma'am!

00:20:47.314 --> 00:20:49.449 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Now, close your eyes.

00:20:51.251 --> 00:20:52.653 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:20:52.787 --> 00:20:57.759 position:21% line:83% align:start

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:03.765 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:06.333 position:41% line:89% align:start
Gotcha.

00:21:06.466 --> 00:21:09.103 position:21% line:83% align:start
[chuckles] With that,
you can consider us even.

00:21:09.604 --> 00:21:11.606 position:13% line:89% align:start
So put a shirt on, already!

00:21:12.439 --> 00:21:14.609 position:38% line:89% align:start
Huh? Huh?

Hm?

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:25.753 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm.

00:21:27.722 --> 00:21:28.689 position:41% line:89% align:start
Sorry.

00:21:30.792 --> 00:21:32.126 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Oh, no!

00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:33.728 position:19% line:83% align:start
Tsukuyo left for school
without her lunch again!

00:21:33.861 --> 00:21:35.663 position:10% line:89% align:start
I've gotta deliver it to her!

00:21:35.797 --> 00:21:38.465 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Akagami, could you pick
up some milk while you're out?

00:21:38.599 --> 00:21:39.901 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Will do!

00:21:41.602 --> 00:21:43.303 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Yeah. I got a new one.

00:21:43.436 --> 00:21:45.039 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MANA]
Wow. Looking good!

00:21:45.173 --> 00:21:46.741 position:13% line:83% align:start
-Wow, it totally suits you!
-[AKEMITSU] Tsukuyo!

00:21:46.874 --> 00:21:48.676 position:24% line:83% align:start
You left your lunch
at home again.

00:21:48.810 --> 00:21:50.578 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Oh, thank you!

00:21:51.478 --> 00:21:52.680 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MANA]
Huh? What's this?

00:21:52.814 --> 00:21:54.381 position:10% line:89% align:start
A lunch from your boyfriend?

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:56.150 position:10% line:89% align:start
He's not my boyfriend, okay?

00:21:56.284 --> 00:22:01.189 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'd describe him more like
he's a part of our family.

00:22:01.321 --> 00:22:02.422 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:22:02.557 --> 00:22:03.958 position:10% line:89% align:start
Could you explain some more?

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.193 position:27% line:89% align:start
Your brother, or?

00:22:05.325 --> 00:22:06.928 position:13% line:89% align:start
Okay, now get out of here.

00:22:07.061 --> 00:22:08.996 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Oh, that's right!

Let's talk facts!

00:23:55.403 --> 00:23:56.904 position:27% line:89% align:start
Indirect kisses?

Only little children think
those are still a big deal!

[BOTH] Tell me, tell me!
Let's talk facts!

00:24:02.009 --> 00:24:05.846 position:10% line:83% align:start
Have you done it? If you ask
what "it" is, then you haven't.
