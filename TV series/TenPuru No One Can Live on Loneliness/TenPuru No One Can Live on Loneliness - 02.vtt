After weighing the options,

00:00:10.545 --> 00:00:12.079 position:10% line:83% align:start
we've decided you'll repay us
with your body.

[shock]
Hold on!

00:00:20.354 --> 00:00:21.689 position:5% line:89% align:start
I meant you'll pay off your debt

00:00:21.823 --> 00:00:23.825 position:24% line:83% align:start
by living and doing
manual labor here!

00:00:23.958 --> 00:00:26.794 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki, please tell me
that he didn't threaten you!

00:00:26.928 --> 00:00:29.931 position:13% line:83% align:start
How could you even suggest
something so inappropriate?

00:00:30.063 --> 00:00:31.533 position:10% line:89% align:start
This is a nunnery after all,

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:33.835 position:7% line:83% align:start
and we don't go for those kinds
of shenanigans here!

00:00:34.702 --> 00:00:37.237 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Everyone good?
-[TSUKUYO, MIA] We're fine.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:39.206 position:19% line:89% align:start
In that case, Akagami,

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.543 position:27% line:83% align:start
if you're ready,
I'll show you around.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:43.076 position:33% line:89% align:start
Let's do it!

00:02:14.301 --> 00:02:17.005 position:10% line:53% align:start
Behold, the principal figure
of our temple.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:18.171 position:21% line:59% align:start
Is that packing tape?

00:02:18.573 --> 00:02:20.975 position:27% line:53% align:start
-[YUZUKI] Broke.
-[AKEMITSU] What?

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.877 position:33% line:89% align:start
We're broke.

00:02:23.778 --> 00:02:24.946 position:33% line:89% align:start
I understand.

00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.214 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll do everything I can
to repay my debt

00:02:27.347 --> 00:02:29.984 position:21% line:83% align:start
as fast as possible.
Every last bit of it!

00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:31.119 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:33.087 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wow! Thank you so much!

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.690 position:5% line:89% align:start
But how about we take our time?

00:02:35.823 --> 00:02:37.959 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm still a bit confused
as to why someone like you

00:02:38.092 --> 00:02:40.061 position:13% line:83% align:start
would want to join a temple
to begin with.

00:02:40.193 --> 00:02:41.495 position:30% line:83% align:start
But I can tell
you're serious about it,

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.531 position:5% line:89% align:start
and that's greatly appreciated.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:45.432 position:33% line:89% align:start
[moved] Aoba.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.704 position:19% line:83% align:start
Better call me Yuzuki.
There's quite a few Aobas here.

00:02:50.203 --> 00:02:51.338 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Got it.

00:02:51.471 --> 00:02:53.173 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Let me show you the other areas.

00:02:53.306 --> 00:02:54.474 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
I'd love that.

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:57.444 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Something's
definitely wrong with Yuzuki.

00:02:57.578 --> 00:02:59.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
They sure seem
to be getting along.

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:01.916 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Well, then we'll just
have to do something

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.051 position:13% line:89% align:start
about that, then, won't we?

00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:05.620 position:7% line:89% align:start
We need to open Yuzuki's eyes!

00:03:05.753 --> 00:03:08.355 position:21% line:83% align:start
Let's drive that guy
out of here now!

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.657 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Yeah!

00:03:10.058 --> 00:03:12.994 position:21% line:83% align:start
Then I suggest we go
with a seduction strategy.

00:03:13.127 --> 00:03:14.227 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:03:14.361 --> 00:03:16.597 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Kiki!
What are you doing here?

00:03:16.731 --> 00:03:17.999 position:41% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:03:18.132 --> 00:03:20.267 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sounds like you're up
to some shenanigans, Tsukuyo.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.203 position:35% line:83% align:start
Am I right?
Here's your strategy.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:25.573 position:30% line:83% align:start
Seduce Akagami,
and once he falls for it

00:03:25.707 --> 00:03:27.875 position:16% line:83% align:start
and tries to make a move,
we kick him out.

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:29.911 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki won't be able
to object to that.

00:03:30.044 --> 00:03:31.478 position:30% line:89% align:start
Not a bad plan.

00:03:31.612 --> 00:03:33.447 position:13% line:83% align:start
But which one of us should
seduce him?

00:03:33.581 --> 00:03:34.882 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
Well, that's easy.

00:03:35.016 --> 00:03:37.819 position:7% line:83% align:start
The girl with the sexiest body,
of course.

00:03:39.187 --> 00:03:40.320 position:35% line:89% align:start
[question]

00:03:40.454 --> 00:03:42.123 position:35% line:83% align:start
Which girl
are you talking about?

00:03:42.255 --> 00:03:43.925 position:30% line:89% align:start
No way, not me?

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.595 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wait, wait, wait, wait!
What about you, Kiki?

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:50.397 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Your breasts are huge, too!
-I could never.

00:03:50.531 --> 00:03:51.966 position:21% line:89% align:start
I happen to be a nun.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.234 position:13% line:83% align:start
[annoyed] You're only a nun
when it's convenient.

00:03:54.602 --> 00:03:58.039 position:5% line:83% align:start
-Best of luck to you, Tsukuyo!
-Yay, you've got this, sweetie!

00:03:58.172 --> 00:03:59.540 position:33% line:89% align:start
No, I don't!

00:03:59.674 --> 00:04:01.175 position:27% line:83% align:start
Please, Tsukuyo,
you're the sexiest girl here!

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:02.643 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:04:02.777 --> 00:04:04.444 position:35% line:89% align:start
Bu-but! Ah!

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.680 position:24% line:89% align:start
[alarm clock rings]

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.522 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Perfect.

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.490 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm nearly back to being
who I used to be.

00:04:17.091 --> 00:04:20.561 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] That's right,
my true blue incorruptible self.

00:04:21.162 --> 00:04:24.665 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, hey, Akagami.
You're up bright and early.

00:04:24.799 --> 00:04:25.398 position:41% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki.

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.300 position:30% line:89% align:start
[choked shock]

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:29.837 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Good morning.

00:04:29.971 --> 00:04:33.708 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Oh, yes, um,
you're up early, too.

00:04:34.075 --> 00:04:35.643 position:5% line:89% align:start
I need to ring the morning bell.

00:04:35.977 --> 00:04:40.380 position:7% line:83% align:start
It's kinda like our alarm clock
around here, you know? Bye.

00:04:40.515 --> 00:04:42.583 position:33% line:89% align:start
[speechless]

00:04:42.717 --> 00:04:45.553 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
My worldly desires!

00:04:47.522 --> 00:04:49.757 position:19% line:83% align:start
He was totally staring
at her tits.

00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:52.860 position:19% line:83% align:start
I've got to find a way
to make him fully break.

00:04:53.961 --> 00:04:56.798 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] All right, everyone.
Breakfast is ready!

00:04:57.397 --> 00:04:58.699 position:41% line:89% align:start
[smirk]

00:04:58.833 --> 00:05:00.601 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] I'll start
with a little warm-up.

00:05:00.735 --> 00:05:03.871 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'll totally trash his cooking.
That'll get him.

00:05:08.375 --> 00:05:09.844 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Let's eat.

00:05:11.646 --> 00:05:13.548 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
It's so good!

00:05:13.915 --> 00:05:14.882 position:30% line:89% align:start
What the heck?

00:05:15.016 --> 00:05:16.984 position:24% line:83% align:start
He's a better cook
than any of us!

00:05:17.685 --> 00:05:20.655 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, my gosh,
I could eat this every day.

00:05:20.788 --> 00:05:23.057 position:7% line:83% align:start
Seems like you're enjoying it.
I'm so glad!

00:05:23.191 --> 00:05:24.457 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:05:28.896 --> 00:05:30.330 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
The skills I've acquired

00:05:30.463 --> 00:05:31.766 position:16% line:83% align:start
striving for independence
are paying off.

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.368 position:10% line:83% align:start
I lost my composure a little
earlier, but she's right.

00:05:35.503 --> 00:05:36.904 position:16% line:89% align:start
There's no need to rush.

00:05:37.605 --> 00:05:39.406 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Hey, what's up?

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:41.474 position:27% line:89% align:start
Oh, hey. Can I...

00:05:43.211 --> 00:05:44.477 position:33% line:89% align:start
[sputtering]

00:05:44.946 --> 00:05:47.715 position:30% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Yes,
he's totally distracted by them.

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.318 position:21% line:83% align:start
I can spot a boob man
from a mile away.

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:54.354 position:10% line:83% align:start
I've got another job for you,
Mr. Manservant. Follow me.

00:05:54.487 --> 00:05:55.923 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Sure.

00:05:57.357 --> 00:05:58.793 position:33% line:89% align:start
What is this?

00:05:58.926 --> 00:06:00.528 position:19% line:83% align:start
Those are work clothes
for temple monks, of course,

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:02.462 position:13% line:83% align:start
and that's what you'll wear
from here on out.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Yeah, no.
Those are summer clothes.

00:06:05.398 --> 00:06:07.869 position:21% line:83% align:start
The material is thin,
and it doesn't come with shoes.

00:06:08.368 --> 00:06:11.272 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wearing that in November
at this temple will be hell.

00:06:11.404 --> 00:06:12.573 position:13% line:89% align:start
He'll run away long before-

00:06:12.707 --> 00:06:14.275 position:27% line:83% align:start
Second Daughter,
thank you so much!

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:15.576 position:41% line:89% align:start
[shock]

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.778 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[cheer]
-[TSUKUYO] Why is he so happy?

00:06:17.912 --> 00:06:19.814 position:19% line:83% align:start
And what does he mean,
"Second Daughter?"

00:06:20.214 --> 00:06:23.383 position:21% line:83% align:start
Anyway, get to work.
You can start by cleaning.

00:06:23.517 --> 00:06:24.785 position:41% line:89% align:start
Got it!

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.654 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
I already finished cleaning!

00:06:26.787 --> 00:06:29.991 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Whoa! You really did!
It's all so clean!

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:32.492 position:13% line:83% align:start
But there's also the bath,
and you gotta clean the toilet,

00:06:32.627 --> 00:06:34.095 position:10% line:89% align:start
and don't forget the graves!

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.663 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Of course!

00:06:35.796 --> 00:06:37.999 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] That would've taken
most people all day!

00:06:38.332 --> 00:06:39.800 position:10% line:89% align:start
Okay, this is your next job.

00:06:39.934 --> 00:06:41.802 position:30% line:83% align:start
Administrative
is a little trickier than just

00:06:41.936 --> 00:06:44.437 position:24% line:83% align:start
There appears to be
an accounting error, here.

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:45.873 position:24% line:89% align:start
[question] No way.

00:06:46.173 --> 00:06:48.342 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Show me where.
-[AKEMITSU] Right here.

00:06:48.475 --> 00:06:51.045 position:7% line:83% align:start
-You just do this, and then...
-[Tsukuyo understand]

00:06:51.178 --> 00:06:53.681 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wow, amazing.
How'd you do that?

00:06:54.348 --> 00:06:55.415 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Wait!

00:06:55.549 --> 00:06:58.653 position:44% line:83% align:start
-No!
-[confused]

00:06:58.786 --> 00:07:00.021 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
All right, then.

00:07:00.154 --> 00:07:02.156 position:35% line:89% align:start
[struggle]

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:03.958 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[giggle]
-Tsukuyo asked me

00:07:04.091 --> 00:07:06.093 position:33% line:83% align:start
to train you
in waterfall meditation.

00:07:06.227 --> 00:07:08.062 position:35% line:83% align:start
And, sorry,
but we don't have a waterfall,

00:07:08.195 --> 00:07:11.766 position:19% line:83% align:start
-so I had to improvise.
-It's fine! No problem at all.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:14.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] So,
this is waterfall meditation.

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:16.137 position:33% line:89% align:start
It's so cold.

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:18.471 position:33% line:83% align:start
I don't know
how long I can stand this!

00:07:18.606 --> 00:07:21.742 position:10% line:83% align:start
If you can't take it anymore,
then why don't you just say so?

00:07:21.876 --> 00:07:23.678 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no point
in trying to be a hero.

00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:26.113 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
No way! I shall persevere!

00:07:26.247 --> 00:07:30.284 position:19% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Hey, I'm home!
What in the world are you doing?

00:07:30.418 --> 00:07:31.786 position:35% line:89% align:start
[confused]

00:07:33.788 --> 00:07:36.590 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Yuzuki in a school uniform?

00:07:37.024 --> 00:07:38.159 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:07:38.292 --> 00:07:39.492 position:33% line:89% align:start
What's this?

00:07:39.627 --> 00:07:41.295 position:19% line:83% align:start
The warmth is returning
to my body.

00:07:41.429 --> 00:07:44.398 position:10% line:83% align:start
The pain I felt a moment ago
is completely gone.

00:07:44.532 --> 00:07:45.900 position:27% line:89% align:start
Could this be...

00:07:46.033 --> 00:07:47.501 position:38% line:89% align:start
Nirvana?

00:07:47.635 --> 00:07:50.504 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm cleansed! Oh, yeah!

00:07:51.138 --> 00:07:53.140 position:5% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] What's gotten into you,
Akagami?

00:07:53.274 --> 00:07:55.276 position:19% line:83% align:start
You need to take a bath
and warm up.

00:07:55.409 --> 00:07:56.410 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Thank you!

00:07:56.544 --> 00:07:58.045 position:19% line:89% align:start
Finally. Finally, I...

00:07:58.179 --> 00:07:59.747 position:13% line:83% align:start
[frustrated] What can I do?
- Okay, just take a bath.

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:02.917 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess there's only
one option left, huh?

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:06.687 position:38% line:89% align:start
[relief]

00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:08.422 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Today was such a good day.

00:08:08.556 --> 00:08:09.857 position:13% line:89% align:start
Both my work and my search

00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:11.759 position:27% line:83% align:start
for enlightenment
are going well.

00:08:11.892 --> 00:08:15.262 position:10% line:83% align:start
I hope I've managed to repay
some of Yuzuki's kindness.

00:08:17.798 --> 00:08:19.400 position:27% line:83% align:start
I shouldn't stay
in the bath too long.

00:08:19.533 --> 00:08:20.835 position:5% line:89% align:start
I need to get ready for dinner.

00:08:20.968 --> 00:08:23.838 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[relaxed]
-[question]

00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:27.842 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[confused]
-[nervous]

00:08:27.975 --> 00:08:30.444 position:38% line:89% align:start
[curious]

00:08:30.578 --> 00:08:33.080 position:24% line:89% align:start
Excuse me, Tsukuyo!

00:08:35.816 --> 00:08:38.753 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'm so sorry about that.
I didn't know you were...

00:08:40.154 --> 00:08:42.857 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Whoa! Why
is she taking off her clothes?

00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:46.627 position:5% line:83% align:start
Calm down. Review the situation.
You're Akemitsu Akagami.

00:08:48.195 --> 00:08:52.233 position:5% line:83% align:start
It's no use! I don't understand!
What's going on here?

00:08:52.767 --> 00:08:54.001 position:41% line:89% align:start
[smirk]

00:08:54.135 --> 00:08:55.569 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
I started undressing too soon!

00:08:55.703 --> 00:08:57.071 position:27% line:89% align:start
I must be stupid!

00:08:57.204 --> 00:08:59.740 position:21% line:83% align:start
Only nymphos take off
their clothes that fast!

00:08:59.874 --> 00:09:02.209 position:16% line:83% align:start
My clothes were supposed
to accidentally slip off,

00:09:02.343 --> 00:09:04.345 position:10% line:83% align:start
and then Yuzuki would show up
right on cue,

00:09:04.478 --> 00:09:07.048 position:13% line:83% align:start
and her mind would go blank
once she saw him naked,

00:09:07.181 --> 00:09:08.616 position:35% line:89% align:start
and then...

00:09:11.118 --> 00:09:12.286 position:33% line:89% align:start
Well, anyway,

00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:14.055 position:19% line:23% align:start
I need to do something
about this situation.

00:09:14.188 --> 00:09:16.457 position:13% line:23% align:start
It has to look like Akagami
is forcing himself on me

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.958 position:16% line:35% align:start
by the time she shows up.

00:09:18.092 --> 00:09:19.927 position:30% line:83% align:start
If I show just
a little more skin,

00:09:20.061 --> 00:09:22.763 position:16% line:83% align:start
then that should totally
force him to pounce on me.

00:09:22.897 --> 00:09:24.565 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, I can't just do it!

00:09:24.698 --> 00:09:26.700 position:38% line:83% align:start
Any more,
and they'll be exposed!

00:09:26.834 --> 00:09:28.569 position:10% line:89% align:start
Then I'd really be a nympho!

00:09:28.702 --> 00:09:30.571 position:13% line:83% align:start
-[AKEMITSU] Um, excuse me.
-[surprise]

00:09:32.807 --> 00:09:33.908 position:35% line:89% align:start
Watch out!

00:09:41.882 --> 00:09:43.784 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you hurt, miss?

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:47.788 position:19% line:89% align:start
Tsukuyo! What happened?

00:09:47.922 --> 00:09:49.924 position:13% line:83% align:start
I heard a really loud noise
and...

00:09:50.559 --> 00:09:51.725 position:38% line:89% align:start
[scream]

00:09:51.859 --> 00:09:53.394 position:21% line:83% align:start
Oh, my gosh, listen,
I'm so sorry,

00:09:53.528 --> 00:09:55.463 position:10% line:83% align:start
I swear I didn't mean to let
things get this far out of hand.

00:09:55.596 --> 00:09:56.864 position:33% line:89% align:start
I screwed up!

00:09:56.997 --> 00:09:59.233 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Wait a minute?
Why am I making excuses?

00:09:59.366 --> 00:10:02.303 position:24% line:83% align:start
One way or another,
hasn't my plan succeeded?

00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:05.439 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Akagami?

00:10:05.574 --> 00:10:06.974 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh, yes, ma'am?

00:10:07.108 --> 00:10:09.944 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Would you mind leaving, please?

00:10:11.445 --> 00:10:12.680 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Okay.

00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:15.749 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Huh?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.351 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:10:19.019 --> 00:10:21.655 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Okay?
-[MIA] Way to go, Tsukuyo!

00:10:21.789 --> 00:10:22.690 position:30% line:89% align:start
I'm impressed!

00:10:22.823 --> 00:10:24.325 position:13% line:89% align:start
You went above and beyond,

00:10:24.458 --> 00:10:26.327 position:19% line:83% align:start
and really carried out
the whole "seduction strategy."

00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:27.895 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're all very proud of you.

00:10:28.028 --> 00:10:30.532 position:24% line:83% align:start
Wow, you really do
make a great nympho, huh?

00:10:30.664 --> 00:10:33.968 position:7% line:83% align:start
That is one oddball compliment,
but, hey, I'll take it.

00:10:34.368 --> 00:10:36.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, go ahead and tell us
how you pulled it off.

00:10:36.871 --> 00:10:38.172 position:30% line:89% align:start
[nervous laugh]

00:10:38.305 --> 00:10:40.040 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Like I could tell them!

00:10:40.174 --> 00:10:43.177 position:10% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Now we've successfully
driven off that man.

00:10:43.978 --> 00:10:45.880 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
So we drove him off, huh?

00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:47.181 position:19% line:89% align:start
If it's what I wanted,

00:10:47.314 --> 00:10:50.050 position:24% line:83% align:start
then why do I feel
so bad about it?

00:10:51.018 --> 00:10:53.154 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Yuzuki.
-Huh?

00:10:54.388 --> 00:10:55.489 position:35% line:89% align:start
What's up?

00:10:55.624 --> 00:10:57.291 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Yuzuki!

00:10:57.825 --> 00:10:59.528 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's the deal?

00:11:00.027 --> 00:11:01.862 position:7% line:89% align:start
Okay, this doesn't make sense.

00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:04.198 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'd understand her
avoiding Akagami,

00:11:04.331 --> 00:11:05.699 position:35% line:89% align:start
but why me?

00:11:05.833 --> 00:11:07.768 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[slam door]
-Yuzuki!

00:11:08.969 --> 00:11:10.037 position:16% line:89% align:start
Why are you avoiding me?

00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:11.906 position:13% line:89% align:start
No! Just stay away from me!

00:11:12.039 --> 00:11:13.240 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
What?

00:11:13.374 --> 00:11:14.808 position:13% line:83% align:start
That's kind of a mean thing
to say!

00:11:15.342 --> 00:11:17.077 position:27% line:83% align:start
The whole thing's
a little awkward for me, too.

00:11:17.211 --> 00:11:19.581 position:13% line:83% align:start
But hey, that doesn't mean
you have to...

00:11:20.014 --> 00:11:22.116 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Yuzuki?
-No, you don't understand!

00:11:22.249 --> 00:11:24.619 position:21% line:83% align:start
Looking at your face
reminds me of what I saw.

00:11:24.752 --> 00:11:26.353 position:13% line:89% align:start
It reminds you of what now?

00:11:26.487 --> 00:11:28.155 position:21% line:89% align:start
Akagami's naked body.

00:11:28.289 --> 00:11:31.091 position:35% line:83% align:start
Or rather,
a certain part of his body!

00:11:32.893 --> 00:11:34.094 position:41% line:89% align:start
[laugh]

00:11:34.228 --> 00:11:36.797 position:33% line:83% align:start
Wow, Yuzuki,
you are such a pervert.

00:11:36.931 --> 00:11:38.966 position:38% line:83% align:start
What now?
You're the perverted one!

00:11:39.099 --> 00:11:41.335 position:16% line:83% align:start
I heard about your little
"seduction strategy."

00:11:41.468 --> 00:11:42.369 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:11:42.504 --> 00:11:44.405 position:19% line:89% align:start
What? How did you know?

00:11:44.972 --> 00:11:46.941 position:33% line:83% align:start
Kiki told me
about the whole thing.

00:11:47.074 --> 00:11:49.276 position:24% line:89% align:start
That freakin' nun!

00:11:50.377 --> 00:11:54.481 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Yuzuki, why did you
let Akagami join our temple?

00:11:54.848 --> 00:11:56.116 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do you not like him?

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:58.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have no problem
with him as a person.

00:11:58.419 --> 00:12:01.121 position:13% line:83% align:start
It just doesn't make sense
for a man to work here.

00:12:01.255 --> 00:12:02.489 position:35% line:89% align:start
[thinking]

00:12:02.624 --> 00:12:05.092 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yeah, to be honest,
I find it a little odd myself.

00:12:05.594 --> 00:12:06.894 position:13% line:89% align:start
But I also believe doing so

00:12:07.027 --> 00:12:08.896 position:24% line:83% align:start
is exactly what Mom
would've done.

00:12:09.897 --> 00:12:10.998 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're so right.

00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:12.466 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep!

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:15.302 position:10% line:83% align:start
"Let anyone who wants to come
and join us, join." Right?

00:12:15.436 --> 00:12:18.806 position:19% line:83% align:start
Regardless of gender.
That's what she'd say.

00:12:19.641 --> 00:12:22.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
And Akagami seemed
really frustrated, too.

00:12:23.277 --> 00:12:25.412 position:16% line:83% align:start
I believe he truly wanted
to change himself

00:12:25.547 --> 00:12:27.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
when he showed up here.

00:12:27.848 --> 00:12:30.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
Frustration is a sign
of earnestness.

00:12:30.818 --> 00:12:33.187 position:30% line:83% align:start
I've only seen
shades of him so far,

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.489 position:5% line:89% align:start
but Akagami is so easy to read.

00:12:36.625 --> 00:12:39.827 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Have I been unfair
in my assessment of him?

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:41.128 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sigh]

00:12:42.229 --> 00:12:45.667 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aw, man. I'm just no match
for you, Yuzuki.

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.935 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Come to think of it,

00:12:48.068 --> 00:12:50.804 position:19% line:83% align:start
he was actually trying
to help me back there.

00:12:52.039 --> 00:12:53.474 position:13% line:89% align:start
What do you think, Tsukuyo,

00:12:53.608 --> 00:12:56.210 position:21% line:83% align:start
is it time we explain
this whole situation to Akagami?

00:12:56.343 --> 00:12:58.012 position:10% line:89% align:start
Maybe a little late for that.

00:12:58.145 --> 00:13:00.914 position:24% line:83% align:start
Akagami just packed
all his things and left.

00:13:01.882 --> 00:13:03.050 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Huh?

00:13:08.389 --> 00:13:11.925 position:16% line:83% align:start
The shame. There's no way
I can face her now.

00:13:12.059 --> 00:13:13.327 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Hey, Akagami?

00:13:13.662 --> 00:13:16.130 position:5% line:89% align:start
Would you mind leaving, please?

00:13:16.463 --> 00:13:18.465 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Before
I disgrace myself any more

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.900 position:21% line:89% align:start
than I already have.

00:13:20.568 --> 00:13:22.036 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll turn myself in!

00:13:22.169 --> 00:13:26.173 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yes, I confess.
A girl I live with saw me naked.

00:13:26.307 --> 00:13:28.543 position:30% line:83% align:start
She then began
removing her clothes.

00:13:28.677 --> 00:13:31.245 position:16% line:83% align:start
I accidentally kissed her
while she was doing that,

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:32.479 position:27% line:89% align:start
so now I'm here.

00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:35.517 position:13% line:89% align:start
[COP] And don't come back.

00:13:36.116 --> 00:13:37.251 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Well, then.

00:13:37.384 --> 00:13:38.753 position:27% line:89% align:start
I have no choice.

00:13:38.919 --> 00:13:41.155 position:27% line:83% align:start
I'll just return
to my old place.

00:13:42.089 --> 00:13:44.258 position:27% line:83% align:start
Oh, somebody else
has already moved in.

00:13:44.391 --> 00:13:47.562 position:7% line:89% align:start
What? What about all my stuff?

00:13:48.028 --> 00:13:49.496 position:38% line:83% align:start
[MANAGER]
I threw it out.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:55.936 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Ah, I guess being
homeless is no big deal.

00:13:57.404 --> 00:13:58.573 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:13:58.707 --> 00:14:00.074 position:16% line:89% align:start
Who's doing the cooking?

00:14:00.207 --> 00:14:01.676 position:5% line:89% align:start
I hope they're eating all right.

00:14:01.810 --> 00:14:04.679 position:24% line:83% align:start
Eh, they'll be fine
as long as Yuzuki's there.

00:14:05.279 --> 00:14:07.047 position:27% line:83% align:start
Though she seemed
sheltered at first,

00:14:07.181 --> 00:14:09.283 position:30% line:83% align:start
she's actually
an independent woman.

00:14:09.416 --> 00:14:12.186 position:30% line:83% align:start
She was even up
early this morning to...

00:14:12.687 --> 00:14:14.154 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:14:14.288 --> 00:14:16.323 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Am I having worldly thoughts?

00:14:16.457 --> 00:14:17.458 position:30% line:89% align:start
No, impossible.

00:14:17.592 --> 00:14:18.859 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now that I've achieved
enlightenment,

00:14:18.992 --> 00:14:20.461 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm above such desires.

00:14:21.228 --> 00:14:23.030 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yes, it was the second
daughter's training

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.466 position:19% line:83% align:start
that helped me achieve
enlightenment.

00:14:25.866 --> 00:14:27.769 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's beautiful, strong-willed,

00:14:27.901 --> 00:14:29.604 position:16% line:83% align:start
and really seems to like
the opposite sex.

00:14:29.738 --> 00:14:32.574 position:35% line:83% align:start
That said,
she was definitely shocked by...

00:14:32.707 --> 00:14:34.274 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:36.544 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why am I haunted
by worldly desires?

00:14:36.678 --> 00:14:39.980 position:10% line:83% align:start
I thought I achieved Nirvana
meditating under that waterfall!

00:14:40.114 --> 00:14:41.982 position:27% line:89% align:start
[rain pattering]

00:14:42.116 --> 00:14:43.651 position:16% line:83% align:start
I mean, I should at least
repay my debt,

00:14:43.785 --> 00:14:45.285 position:27% line:83% align:start
even if doing so
costs me my life!

00:14:45.419 --> 00:14:47.254 position:13% line:89% align:start
It's a small price to pay!

00:14:48.757 --> 00:14:50.157 position:21% line:89% align:start
What's wrong with me?

00:14:50.290 --> 00:14:53.360 position:10% line:83% align:start
Am I just incapable of doing
anything on my own?

00:14:58.298 --> 00:15:00.067 position:10% line:89% align:start
What are you doing, you fool?

00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:03.036 position:13% line:83% align:start
It's the middle of winter!
You'll die!

00:15:04.238 --> 00:15:07.074 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Akagami!
Why won't you look at me!

00:15:07.207 --> 00:15:08.810 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why are you being so stupid?

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:11.713 position:13% line:89% align:start
Because! It's too tempting!

00:15:11.846 --> 00:15:13.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Unbelievable.

00:15:13.414 --> 00:15:15.182 position:10% line:83% align:start
Why did you leave the temple
all of a sudden?

00:15:15.315 --> 00:15:18.018 position:35% line:83% align:start
Huh? Well,
if you really need to know,

00:15:18.152 --> 00:15:19.386 position:21% line:89% align:start
because you said to.

00:15:19.521 --> 00:15:20.822 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:15:20.954 --> 00:15:22.322 position:27% line:89% align:start
I meant the bath!

00:15:22.456 --> 00:15:24.425 position:7% line:83% align:start
I asked you to leave the bath,
you stupid boy!

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:27.529 position:35% line:83% align:start
-The bath?
-[YUZUKI] Listen to me, Akagami.

00:15:27.662 --> 00:15:29.531 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're still just a child,
you know.

00:15:29.664 --> 00:15:31.331 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's nothing wrong
with needing help.

00:15:31.465 --> 00:15:33.400 position:30% line:83% align:start
The bath issue
could've been resolved

00:15:33.535 --> 00:15:35.537 position:19% line:83% align:start
if there had only been
some explanation.

00:15:35.670 --> 00:15:36.838 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:15:36.970 --> 00:15:38.807 position:33% line:83% align:start
You can start
relying on me more, now.

00:15:39.306 --> 00:15:41.942 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're new to your training,
and you're just a child.

00:15:42.075 --> 00:15:44.546 position:38% line:83% align:start
[thought]
Wait, how old are you, anyway?

00:15:44.679 --> 00:15:48.015 position:7% line:83% align:start
-Oh, I'm twenty-one years old.
-[Yuzuki realize]

00:15:48.148 --> 00:15:50.350 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, you're actually older
than I am.

00:15:50.484 --> 00:15:53.187 position:33% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki Aoba.
I'm seventeen.

00:15:53.855 --> 00:15:55.055 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're extremely polite.

00:15:55.389 --> 00:15:56.891 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're a fully grown man!

00:15:57.024 --> 00:15:58.992 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no shame
in relying on others!

00:15:59.126 --> 00:16:00.628 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:16:00.762 --> 00:16:02.931 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] And if you still
somehow haven't figured out

00:16:03.063 --> 00:16:05.667 position:30% line:83% align:start
how to do that
by the age of twenty-one,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:08.168 position:21% line:83% align:start
then you best believe
I'm gonna teach you!

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:10.370 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think it's high time
you learned!

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:12.272 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:16:15.810 --> 00:16:17.277 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Holy wow.

00:16:17.411 --> 00:16:21.516 position:21% line:83% align:start
I had my suspicions,
but she truly is a meathead!

00:16:21.649 --> 00:16:23.383 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[YUZUKI] Akagami.
-[AKEMITSU] Yes?

00:16:24.051 --> 00:16:26.955 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] The first key to
achieving enlightenment is this.

00:16:27.421 --> 00:16:30.457 position:13% line:83% align:start
No one should have to live
a hermit's life.

00:16:31.024 --> 00:16:32.192 position:44% line:89% align:start
[awe]

00:16:32.326 --> 00:16:33.327 position:21% line:83% align:start
Now that you've come
to our temple,

00:16:33.460 --> 00:16:35.530 position:7% line:89% align:start
I will not let you live alone.

00:16:35.663 --> 00:16:38.600 position:16% line:83% align:start
-What do you say to that?
-[uncertain]

00:16:39.166 --> 00:16:40.300 position:27% line:89% align:start
You're here, too?

00:16:41.936 --> 00:16:42.971 position:38% line:89% align:start
[nervous]

00:16:43.103 --> 00:16:44.706 position:35% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
I'm sorry.

00:16:45.072 --> 00:16:46.641 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry that I tricked you.

00:16:46.774 --> 00:16:49.009 position:19% line:83% align:start
And I'm sorry I assumed
you weren't serious.

00:16:49.142 --> 00:16:53.113 position:5% line:83% align:start
No, I'm sorry about your boobs.
I mean that I touched them, and-

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:54.516 position:7% line:89% align:start
Would you please stop talking?

00:16:54.649 --> 00:16:57.852 position:7% line:83% align:start
-[AKEMITSU] Right! Sorry again!
-[smile]

00:16:58.686 --> 00:17:00.655 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's go home.
Like right now.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:03.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[TSUKUYO] I'm hungry.
-Okay, then.

00:17:03.357 --> 00:17:06.059 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Right. Akagami,
hold out your hand.

00:17:11.331 --> 00:17:13.133 position:19% line:89% align:start
That was my first kiss.

00:17:13.968 --> 00:17:15.703 position:7% line:89% align:start
So you'd better pay up, quick.

00:17:15.837 --> 00:17:17.572 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, for real?

00:17:20.808 --> 00:17:22.109 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
We're here.

00:17:22.242 --> 00:17:23.811 position:19% line:89% align:start
Welcome back, I guess.

00:17:24.144 --> 00:17:25.880 position:13% line:89% align:start
I've humbly made my return.

00:17:26.380 --> 00:17:29.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
If you'll have me,
I'd like to rejoin your temple.

00:17:29.551 --> 00:17:31.920 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, would you just shut up
and get inside?

00:17:32.052 --> 00:17:33.721 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah, what's going on?

00:17:33.855 --> 00:17:35.990 position:30% line:83% align:start
Please tell me
what he's doing back here.

00:17:36.123 --> 00:17:38.292 position:38% line:83% align:start
Uh, well,
I just figured it'd be okay

00:17:38.425 --> 00:17:40.193 position:13% line:89% align:start
if he lived here, ya know?

00:17:40.327 --> 00:17:43.330 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Thank you so much.
-[shock]

00:17:43.463 --> 00:17:45.033 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mia?

00:17:45.733 --> 00:17:47.200 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
What's wrong with her?

00:17:47.334 --> 00:17:48.870 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
She's got issues.

00:17:49.003 --> 00:17:52.740 position:7% line:83% align:start
Anyway, we should take a bath.
What do you say, Tsukuyo?

00:17:52.874 --> 00:17:54.274 position:24% line:89% align:start
You really should.

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:55.643 position:10% line:83% align:start
Your clothes are practically
see-through, Second Dau-

00:17:55.777 --> 00:17:57.712 position:38% line:83% align:start
-[groans]
-Don't worry about me, okay?

00:17:57.845 --> 00:18:01.214 position:38% line:83% align:start
And also,
you'd best call me Tsukuyo.

00:18:01.816 --> 00:18:02.951 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not that weird nickname.

00:18:03.083 --> 00:18:04.919 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes. Understood.

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:08.556 position:7% line:83% align:start
I'm glad you're back, Tsukuyo.
It's good to see you.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.058 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kurage.

00:18:10.190 --> 00:18:12.225 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I see you're back as well,
Akagami.

00:18:12.827 --> 00:18:16.296 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yes! Very humbly,
Miss Third Daughter.

00:18:16.430 --> 00:18:18.700 position:7% line:83% align:start
Kurage's "Miss Third Daughter,"
now?

00:18:18.833 --> 00:18:21.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki said she'd be eagerly
awaiting you in the bath.

00:18:22.102 --> 00:18:24.872 position:10% line:83% align:start
[amused] Well, it's not like
there's any big rush.

00:18:25.006 --> 00:18:26.406 position:5% line:89% align:start
She's normally so level-headed.

00:18:26.541 --> 00:18:28.843 position:38% line:83% align:start
I wonder
why she's so excited now?

00:18:29.142 --> 00:18:30.444 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah,

00:18:30.578 --> 00:18:33.213 position:19% line:83% align:start
she honestly used to be
a lot more stupid.

00:18:33.347 --> 00:18:34.782 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[surprise]
-[surprise]

00:18:34.916 --> 00:18:37.284 position:16% line:83% align:start
She was totally carefree
and her mind was a blank.

00:18:37.417 --> 00:18:39.319 position:19% line:83% align:start
In fact, you might say
there was nothing at all

00:18:39.453 --> 00:18:41.623 position:7% line:83% align:start
-going on upstairs. [surprise]
-Kurage, stop.

00:18:42.456 --> 00:18:44.324 position:27% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki was never
what you would call stupid,

00:18:44.458 --> 00:18:46.259 position:35% line:83% align:start
but perhaps
it's fair to say she was-

00:18:46.393 --> 00:18:48.796 position:30% line:83% align:start
-What, useless?
-Ugh, useless, really?

00:18:48.930 --> 00:18:51.566 position:21% line:83% align:start
Yeah, you're starting
to give me a headache, you know.

00:18:51.699 --> 00:18:53.835 position:5% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] You mustn't say that,
Miss Third Daughter.

00:18:54.334 --> 00:18:56.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
I mean, after all,
Yuzuki is your sister.

00:18:56.804 --> 00:18:58.539 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Yeah, that's right.

00:18:58.673 --> 00:19:01.141 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think, perhaps a better word
for Yuzuki is "meathead."

00:19:01.274 --> 00:19:03.276 position:10% line:83% align:start
You'd better watch yourself,
too.

00:19:03.410 --> 00:19:05.580 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Tsukuyo, hurry up!

00:19:05.713 --> 00:19:08.348 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Okay, coming, Yuzuki.

00:19:08.482 --> 00:19:09.951 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'm really off my game
these days.

00:19:10.084 --> 00:19:13.186 position:13% line:83% align:start
Sometimes I think Tsukuyo's
in love with her sister.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:15.556 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Well,
would you look at the time?

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.259 position:21% line:83% align:start
Miss Third Daughter,
I'm going to make us dinner.

00:19:19.761 --> 00:19:20.561 position:35% line:89% align:start
[QUESTION]

00:19:20.695 --> 00:19:21.696 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'll help.

00:19:23.497 --> 00:19:25.833 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
So, uh, when you said earlier

00:19:25.967 --> 00:19:28.435 position:13% line:83% align:start
that Yuzuki used to be dumb
and useless-

00:19:28.569 --> 00:19:29.671 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE]
It's true.

00:19:29.804 --> 00:19:31.973 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
I can't even imagine it.

00:19:32.106 --> 00:19:33.541 position:30% line:89% align:start
Of course not.

00:19:33.675 --> 00:19:35.342 position:10% line:83% align:start
I mean, you've only known her
a day or two, right?

00:19:35.475 --> 00:19:36.978 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
True. You've got a point there.

00:19:37.111 --> 00:19:38.946 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
But I really want to know more!

00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:40.581 position:41% line:89% align:start
Badly!

00:19:40.715 --> 00:19:42.784 position:16% line:83% align:start
No, no, no! That would be
an invasion of her privacy.

00:19:42.917 --> 00:19:44.519 position:27% line:89% align:start
But then again...

00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:48.556 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's 17 years
of Yuzuki that I don't know yet.

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:51.324 position:7% line:83% align:start
And I want to learn everything
as soon as I can!

00:19:51.458 --> 00:19:53.094 position:16% line:83% align:start
Do you want to watch them
in the bath?

00:19:53.226 --> 00:19:54.494 position:19% line:89% align:start
Where'd that come from?

00:19:54.629 --> 00:19:56.396 position:16% line:83% align:start
You just said you wanted
to know everything.

00:19:56.531 --> 00:19:58.833 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, my God, I'm so dumb.
I said that part out loud!

00:19:58.966 --> 00:20:02.070 position:16% line:83% align:start
No! I didn't mean to say
anything so insolent.

00:20:02.202 --> 00:20:06.074 position:13% line:83% align:start
Besides, this is a temple.
That would be an abomination.

00:20:06.541 --> 00:20:09.677 position:21% line:83% align:start
Being a lustful perv
isn't all that serious.

00:20:10.477 --> 00:20:12.180 position:33% line:89% align:start
Uh, why not?

00:20:12.312 --> 00:20:13.380 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE]
Because you're human.

00:20:13.514 --> 00:20:15.016 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's that supposed to mean?

00:20:15.149 --> 00:20:18.186 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, think about this.
Even the Buddha has children.

00:20:18.318 --> 00:20:19.954 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm the child of a monk, too.

00:20:20.088 --> 00:20:21.889 position:21% line:83% align:start
That means that a man
and a woman engaged in-

00:20:22.023 --> 00:20:24.092 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Stop, Miss Third Daughter.

00:20:24.959 --> 00:20:27.729 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] Yuzuki's
probably pervy, too, honestly.

00:20:28.529 --> 00:20:30.898 position:16% line:89% align:start
In a closeted kinda way.

00:20:31.666 --> 00:20:32.934 position:38% line:89% align:start
Closeted?

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:35.002 position:21% line:83% align:start
Meaning I don't think
she'd be mad if you peeped in.

00:20:35.136 --> 00:20:38.338 position:30% line:83% align:start
Wait a second.
That logic is totally flawed.

00:20:38.773 --> 00:20:40.373 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMISU]
This girl.

00:20:40.508 --> 00:20:43.578 position:5% line:83% align:start
She's so innocent, but that also
makes her dangerous!

00:20:44.244 --> 00:20:47.014 position:5% line:89% align:start
Uh, um, I just don't think that-

00:20:47.148 --> 00:20:48.516 position:27% line:89% align:start
Duh, I'm joking.

00:20:48.649 --> 00:20:51.018 position:16% line:83% align:start
Teasing people like this
used to be Yuzuki's job,

00:20:51.152 --> 00:20:53.654 position:16% line:83% align:start
and if I'm being honest,
I wish it still was.

00:20:53.788 --> 00:20:56.090 position:19% line:83% align:start
But now she's changing,
and I guess she thinks

00:20:56.224 --> 00:20:58.860 position:30% line:83% align:start
she's too good
for childish things like that.

00:20:58.993 --> 00:21:00.862 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tsukuyo's changing, too.

00:21:00.995 --> 00:21:03.965 position:16% line:83% align:start
She'd started to grow up,
little by little.

00:21:04.999 --> 00:21:06.266 position:16% line:89% align:start
But since you showed up,

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:08.503 position:16% line:83% align:start
they've both been acting
kind of dumb again.

00:21:09.003 --> 00:21:10.505 position:35% line:89% align:start
[surprise]

00:21:10.638 --> 00:21:13.174 position:10% line:83% align:start
The truth is, I kind of like
them a little better dumb.

00:21:13.741 --> 00:21:15.510 position:33% line:83% align:start
What I guess
I'm getting at with all this

00:21:15.643 --> 00:21:17.745 position:19% line:83% align:start
is that I'm really glad
you came back.

00:21:18.378 --> 00:21:19.714 position:27% line:89% align:start
So, welcome home.

00:21:22.415 --> 00:21:24.451 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
You're such a nice girl!

00:21:25.086 --> 00:21:28.488 position:10% line:83% align:start
-You don't need to thank me!
-But I want to thank you.

00:21:28.623 --> 00:21:30.457 position:27% line:89% align:start
So I'll show you.

00:21:31.626 --> 00:21:33.694 position:30% line:83% align:start
Now you'll know
everything about them.

00:21:33.828 --> 00:21:35.997 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, please don't!
Miss Third Daughter!

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:38.699 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Stop!
-Twirly twirl.

00:21:46.941 --> 00:21:48.408 position:38% line:89% align:start

-[frustrated]

00:21:55.817 --> 00:21:58.351 position:13% line:83% align:start
Kurage, you shouldn't tease
poor Akagami so much.

00:21:58.485 --> 00:21:59.754 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah.

00:21:59.887 --> 00:22:02.023 position:24% line:83% align:start
Do you understand,
Miss Third Daughter?

00:22:02.156 --> 00:22:03.958 position:19% line:89% align:start
Please, no pervy stuff.

00:22:04.091 --> 00:22:05.760 position:38% line:89% align:start
[amused]

00:22:06.393 --> 00:22:08.729 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Well, you seem to be having fun.

00:22:08.863 --> 00:22:10.298 position:44% line:89% align:start
But!

00:22:10.430 --> 00:22:13.935 position:7% line:83% align:start
This temple has become corrupt.
And it's your fault, Akagami!

00:22:14.068 --> 00:22:15.803 position:35% line:89% align:start
[question]

00:22:16.204 --> 00:22:18.438 position:41% line:89% align:start
[anger]

[amused]

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:54.402 position:21% line:89% align:start
Akagami saw something

00:23:54.535 --> 00:23:56.103 position:21% line:83% align:start
that would embarrass
anybody, honestly.

00:23:56.237 --> 00:23:57.972 position:13% line:89% align:start
No! Well, what did he see?

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:00.074 position:24% line:83% align:start
He saw me lick off
the ice cream stuck to the lid.

00:24:00.207 --> 00:24:02.944 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh, you had me freaked out.
I thought he saw something else.

00:24:03.077 --> 00:24:05.846 position:16% line:83% align:start
[laugh] Oh, well I forgot
to mention, he saw my boobs.

00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:07.581 position:33% line:89% align:start
Akagami, no!
