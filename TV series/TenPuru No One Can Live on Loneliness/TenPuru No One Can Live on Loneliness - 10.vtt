00:00:10.678 --> 00:00:12.179 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hmm.

00:00:19.754 --> 00:00:22.422 position:24% line:83% align:start
Hey! So how are you
feeling today, Akagami?

00:00:22.624 --> 00:00:23.892 position:38% line:89% align:start
Terrific.

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:26.761 position:7% line:83% align:start
Like, I've died and been reborn
as a whole new man.

00:00:26.995 --> 00:00:28.161 position:35% line:89% align:start
Literally?

00:00:28.295 --> 00:00:30.130 position:33% line:83% align:start
I've awakened
completely refreshed

00:00:30.264 --> 00:00:32.534 position:7% line:89% align:start
and ready to take on anything.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.434 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well, don't push yourself.

00:00:34.569 --> 00:00:37.037 position:16% line:83% align:start
Kiki and I are just about
to head out for a bit.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.172 position:10% line:89% align:start
But Kagura and Mia are awake.

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:41.843 position:27% line:83% align:start
Hey, why are you
cowering all of a sudden?

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:43.545 position:27% line:89% align:start
Morning, Akagami!

00:00:43.778 --> 00:00:46.046 position:24% line:83% align:start
And a good morning
to you as well, Mia.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.849 position:13% line:89% align:start
So, where's everybody else?

00:00:47.982 --> 00:00:50.952 position:16% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Tsukuyo and Kurage
still haven't gotten up yet.

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:53.120 position:21% line:83% align:start
Kagura's in her room,
on her computer.

00:00:53.253 --> 00:00:55.188 position:19% line:89% align:start
[frightened whimpering]

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:56.624 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:00:58.292 --> 00:00:59.192 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kagura.

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:01.295 position:19% line:89% align:start
[frightened whimpering]

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:04.097 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kagura

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:05.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
[frightened whimpering]

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.236 position:27% line:83% align:start
Operation Akagami
Plus Kagura is go!

00:01:10.572 --> 00:01:12.172 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's this in reference to?

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:14.141 position:10% line:89% align:start
You may go as far as kissing.

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:16.844 position:7% line:83% align:start
Thanks, but I'm still not sure
what's going on.

00:01:16.978 --> 00:01:18.613 position:16% line:89% align:start
Akagami's scared of you.

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:19.981 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
My, my.

00:01:20.113 --> 00:01:21.516 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's like he's connecting you

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:24.418 position:13% line:83% align:start
to some kind of incredibly
traumatic experience.

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:26.721 position:10% line:89% align:start
I may have overdone it a bit.

00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:28.990 position:21% line:83% align:start
If there's bad blood
between the two of you,

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:30.223 position:19% line:89% align:start
then we have to fix it!

00:01:30.357 --> 00:01:32.159 position:30% line:83% align:start
Kagura? I won't
be happy till you

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:34.227 position:30% line:83% align:start
look at Akagami
the same way I do!

00:01:34.361 --> 00:01:36.664 position:10% line:83% align:start
That's definitely going to be
a stretch.

00:01:36.798 --> 00:01:38.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
First, let's establish
your current

00:01:38.432 --> 00:01:39.701 position:13% line:89% align:start
impressions of each other.

00:01:39.834 --> 00:01:42.637 position:16% line:83% align:start
Akagami, how do you feel
when you look at Kagura?

00:01:42.837 --> 00:01:46.340 position:16% line:83% align:start
Every time I look at her
my groin throbs and tingles.

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.442 position:13% line:89% align:start
Outright sexual harassment.

00:01:48.576 --> 00:01:50.277 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's a positive impression.

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.913 position:19% line:89% align:start
Positively actionable.

00:01:52.046 --> 00:01:53.380 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yes, you're right.

00:01:53.514 --> 00:01:55.984 position:21% line:83% align:start
And, Kagura, what do
you think of Akagami?

00:01:56.116 --> 00:01:57.284 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:01:57.451 --> 00:01:59.219 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well, to be perfectly
honest with you,

00:01:59.353 --> 00:02:00.822 position:19% line:89% align:start
I think he's wonderful.

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:01.856 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.390 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's him in a nutshell!

00:02:03.524 --> 00:02:06.094 position:13% line:83% align:start
In fact, he's an especially
wonderful guy! Yup!

00:02:06.226 --> 00:02:08.362 position:7% line:89% align:start
Aw, go on. You're far too kind.

00:02:08.495 --> 00:02:10.497 position:19% line:89% align:start
He's earnest, loyal...

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:13.101 position:27% line:83% align:start
I absolutely have
to get rid of him.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:14.434 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, you two!

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.504 position:27% line:83% align:start
This is actually
going really well!

00:02:16.671 --> 00:02:19.807 position:10% line:83% align:start
I think we can jump straight
to the final step already!

00:02:22.844 --> 00:02:24.946 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm locking you in
here till morning.

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:27.214 position:27% line:83% align:start
But it's morning
right now, Mia!

00:02:27.582 --> 00:02:30.018 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIA] This is where Akagami
and I opened up to each other.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.053 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'm sure this'll do the trick!

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.957 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'll be back later to set up
the Twister penance for you!

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.457 position:35% line:89% align:start
Come back!

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:41.529 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's funny, isn't it?

00:02:41.663 --> 00:02:44.899 position:21% line:83% align:start
My own strategy being
turned against me like this.

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:46.634 position:24% line:89% align:start
[nervous chuckling]

00:02:46.768 --> 00:02:47.702 position:35% line:89% align:start
I guess so.

00:02:47.835 --> 00:02:49.604 position:24% line:83% align:start
At least she's not
making us do that

00:02:49.737 --> 00:02:52.305 position:13% line:83% align:start
"Hundred Poems by a Hundred
Poets" nonsense I taught her.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.241 position:13% line:89% align:start
You mean that was you, too?

00:02:54.474 --> 00:02:55.777 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Could she be responsible

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.477 position:16% line:89% align:start
for all Mia's wild ideas?

00:02:57.612 --> 00:02:59.547 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Say, here's a thought.

00:02:59.681 --> 00:03:00.715 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:03:01.314 --> 00:03:02.550 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.085 position:24% line:89% align:start
If I tell everyone

00:03:04.251 --> 00:03:06.353 position:16% line:83% align:start
you forced yourself on me
while we were stuck in here,

00:03:06.486 --> 00:03:07.689 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'm sure you'll be kicked

00:03:07.822 --> 00:03:09.824 position:27% line:83% align:start
out of the temple
without a second thought.

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:11.659 position:21% line:89% align:start
[nervous whimpering]

00:03:13.661 --> 00:03:15.228 position:10% line:89% align:start
You know, your best move here

00:03:15.362 --> 00:03:18.398 position:10% line:83% align:start
would be to expose me to Mia
by telling her about my plan.

00:03:18.766 --> 00:03:21.703 position:19% line:83% align:start
That would put me in an
extremely difficult position.

00:03:21.836 --> 00:03:23.971 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'd never do that to you. Okay?

00:03:24.105 --> 00:03:27.075 position:7% line:83% align:start
I have no interest in fighting
with you, Lady Kagura.

00:03:27.207 --> 00:03:28.408 position:27% line:83% align:start
-[KAGURA] "Lady?"
-[AKAGAMI] In fact

00:03:28.543 --> 00:03:30.511 position:33% line:83% align:start
if possible,
I'd like to be friends.

00:03:30.912 --> 00:03:33.681 position:21% line:83% align:start
Because the truth is,
I like you.

00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:34.849 position:44% line:89% align:start
I do.

00:03:34.982 --> 00:03:36.216 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:37.952 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sighs]

00:03:38.086 --> 00:03:40.420 position:16% line:83% align:start
Must you really hit on me
at a time like this?

00:03:40.555 --> 00:03:42.790 position:10% line:89% align:start
Huh! That's not what I meant.

00:03:42.924 --> 00:03:44.759 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why are you all the way
over there?

00:03:44.892 --> 00:03:47.595 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm sorry. My body
reacted instinctively.

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:50.765 position:10% line:83% align:start
[sighs] You know, everything
would be so much easier

00:03:50.898 --> 00:03:54.569 position:10% line:83% align:start
if you'd just seduce Mia and
take responsibility for her.

00:03:56.336 --> 00:03:58.673 position:21% line:89% align:start
Oh, how interesting.

00:03:59.339 --> 00:04:01.576 position:33% line:83% align:start
-What is it?
-Oh, nothing.

00:04:01.743 --> 00:04:03.811 position:13% line:89% align:start
Absolutely nothing at all.

00:04:03.945 --> 00:04:05.046 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's open!

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:06.881 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] It's called
"the lever principle."

00:04:07.014 --> 00:04:09.617 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] No, it's called
kicking the door down!

00:04:09.751 --> 00:04:10.585 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:04:11.018 --> 00:04:13.286 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why didn't it
occur to me sooner?

00:04:13.588 --> 00:04:15.823 position:30% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] I can
take Akagami by force.

00:04:15.957 --> 00:04:18.993 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll redirect his feelings
from Yuzuki to Mia,

00:04:19.127 --> 00:04:21.662 position:19% line:83% align:start
and then bring him back
to the Christoph family.

00:04:21.996 --> 00:04:25.332 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh, Akagami. You're
right, let's be friends.

00:04:25.465 --> 00:04:26.701 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:06:00.493 --> 00:06:02.395 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait a second, Akagami.

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:04.632 position:13% line:83% align:start
I know we kissed each other
that one time.

00:06:04.765 --> 00:06:07.501 position:7% line:89% align:start
But still, that doesn't mean...

00:06:08.936 --> 00:06:09.971 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:06:10.304 --> 00:06:12.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
No! We can't do this!

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.411 position:27% line:89% align:start
Please, Akagami.

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:20.781 position:35% line:89% align:start
At least...

00:06:21.282 --> 00:06:22.984 position:35% line:89% align:start
be gentle.

00:06:26.587 --> 00:06:27.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
[straining]

00:06:27.822 --> 00:06:29.489 position:38% line:89% align:start
Don't...

00:06:35.897 --> 00:06:37.064 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:41.836 position:33% line:89% align:start
Good morning.

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.437 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did you sleep well, Tsukuyo?

00:06:44.572 --> 00:06:46.140 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kurage.

00:06:46.274 --> 00:06:48.009 position:24% line:89% align:start
Yeah, good morning.

00:06:48.276 --> 00:06:50.811 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] Would you
mind letting go of me?

00:06:51.078 --> 00:06:52.412 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Uh, sure.

00:06:53.314 --> 00:06:56.150 position:16% line:83% align:start
I'll buy you a chocolate
parfait if you keep this quiet.

00:06:57.218 --> 00:06:58.653 position:33% line:89% align:start
Extra large?

00:06:58.786 --> 00:07:01.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
[grunts] Fine!

00:07:03.224 --> 00:07:04.258 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:07:04.859 --> 00:07:07.161 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Why in the world
would I dream such a thing?

00:07:07.528 --> 00:07:09.997 position:10% line:89% align:start
Am I really that unfulfilled?

00:07:10.364 --> 00:07:12.066 position:24% line:83% align:start
-[AKAGAMI]Tsukuyo!
-Hmm.

00:07:14.335 --> 00:07:16.137 position:24% line:89% align:start
Hey. Good morning.

00:07:17.538 --> 00:07:18.806 position:38% line:89% align:start
You too.

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:20.975 position:24% line:83% align:start
Guess I better get
started on breakfast.

00:07:21.108 --> 00:07:22.176 position:35% line:89% align:start
All right!

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:23.611 position:24% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Look what
a good mood he's in.

00:07:23.744 --> 00:07:25.413 position:16% line:89% align:start
Not a care in the world.

00:07:25.746 --> 00:07:27.548 position:33% line:83% align:start
I never would
have had that stupid dream

00:07:27.682 --> 00:07:29.650 position:19% line:89% align:start
if he hadn't kissed me.

00:07:30.718 --> 00:07:32.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
Still it was an accident.

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:34.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can't really hold it
against him.

00:07:34.755 --> 00:07:36.991 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[MIA] Akagami!
-Hmm?

00:07:37.124 --> 00:07:38.859 position:24% line:83% align:start
What's on the menu
this morning?

00:07:38.993 --> 00:07:40.795 position:7% line:89% align:start
How does fried fish strike you?

00:07:41.028 --> 00:07:42.663 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Sounds delicious!
-[TSUKUYO] Huh?!

00:07:42.797 --> 00:07:45.032 position:10% line:83% align:start
-Then sit tight, and I'll get
to it! -What did I miss?

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:48.736 position:24% line:83% align:start
When did those two
become so close?

00:07:49.270 --> 00:07:50.638 position:30% line:89% align:start
[heart beating]

00:07:52.907 --> 00:07:54.442 position:16% line:89% align:start
Quite curious, isn't it?

00:07:54.575 --> 00:07:55.776 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:07:55.977 --> 00:07:58.813 position:30% line:83% align:start
Could you stop
sneaking around like that?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:01.849 position:33% line:89% align:start
But you know,

00:08:01.983 --> 00:08:04.185 position:19% line:83% align:start
I think I can shed some
light on their closeness.

00:08:04.652 --> 00:08:06.253 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
With your camera?

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:09.857 position:38% line:89% align:start
[moaning]

00:08:09.991 --> 00:08:11.625 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Akagami, please.

00:08:11.759 --> 00:08:12.893 position:30% line:89% align:start
Couldn't you...

00:08:13.027 --> 00:08:15.796 position:10% line:89% align:start
slow down just a little bit?

00:08:19.266 --> 00:08:20.968 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] This is
just the beginning, Mia.

00:08:21.102 --> 00:08:22.570 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
What you're seeing here is

00:08:22.703 --> 00:08:24.472 position:27% line:83% align:start
a ritual known as
Twister penance.

00:08:24.605 --> 00:08:26.574 position:24% line:89% align:start
No! What the heck?

00:08:26.707 --> 00:08:28.876 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why would you show
me a video like that?

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.044 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:32.813 position:7% line:89% align:start
Hey, was that Akagami and Mia?

00:08:32.947 --> 00:08:35.950 position:16% line:83% align:start
Bingo! Would you like to
continue watching now?

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:38.953 position:30% line:83% align:start
Gimme a break!
I don't wanna see that!

00:08:39.186 --> 00:08:40.454 position:30% line:89% align:start
If you say so.

00:08:41.355 --> 00:08:43.491 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
So those two are an item now?

00:08:43.958 --> 00:08:45.493 position:10% line:89% align:start
This doesn't make any sense.

00:08:45.626 --> 00:08:47.895 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mia hated Akagami at first!

00:08:49.964 --> 00:08:51.098 position:44% line:89% align:start
Whoa.

00:08:51.432 --> 00:08:52.733 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Akagami.

00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:54.668 position:24% line:89% align:start
I lost my balance.

00:08:55.603 --> 00:08:57.171 position:19% line:89% align:start
Are you all right, Mia?

00:08:57.638 --> 00:08:59.840 position:35% line:83% align:start
[giggling]
Don't worry.

00:09:00.908 --> 00:09:03.978 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm fine. I just got
a little turned on.

00:09:04.245 --> 00:09:06.280 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
She's madly in love with him!

00:09:06.414 --> 00:09:08.416 position:7% line:89% align:start
And she's turned on right now?

00:09:08.549 --> 00:09:09.784 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:14.188 position:10% line:89% align:start
Let's start the questioning.

00:09:14.321 --> 00:09:16.157 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm Kagura, the secretary.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:17.725 position:19% line:89% align:start
Wait, what's happening?

00:09:17.858 --> 00:09:21.028 position:16% line:83% align:start
Are you sure we shouldn't
bring Akagami in as well?

00:09:21.362 --> 00:09:22.296 position:27% line:89% align:start
There's no point.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:23.864 position:10% line:89% align:start
I can't look him in the eye.

00:09:23.998 --> 00:09:26.767 position:21% line:83% align:start
Tell me, what's your
angle here, Kagura?

00:09:28.102 --> 00:09:29.570 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
I'm just interested in

00:09:29.703 --> 00:09:31.405 position:19% line:83% align:start
anything and everything
to do with Mia.

00:09:31.906 --> 00:09:34.108 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
I see. Very well.

00:09:34.675 --> 00:09:36.545 position:35% line:83% align:start
Now, then,
I've heard discipline

00:09:36.677 --> 00:09:39.113 position:27% line:83% align:start
around the temple
has gotten a bit lax.

00:09:39.313 --> 00:09:41.148 position:33% line:83% align:start
What's more,
it seems the one at

00:09:41.282 --> 00:09:43.417 position:35% line:83% align:start
the center
of the problem is you.

00:09:43.918 --> 00:09:45.086 position:19% line:89% align:start
How dare you say that?

00:09:45.219 --> 00:09:46.854 position:30% line:83% align:start
I haven't done
anything shameful!

00:09:46.987 --> 00:09:48.989 position:13% line:89% align:start
You couldn't be more wrong!

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.891 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] I take
it that means you're willing

00:09:51.025 --> 00:09:52.460 position:16% line:89% align:start
to answer our questions?

00:09:52.593 --> 00:09:54.128 position:21% line:89% align:start
[MIA] Most certainly!

00:09:54.929 --> 00:09:58.567 position:19% line:89% align:start
Well, all right. Mia...

00:09:58.933 --> 00:10:01.702 position:10% line:89% align:start
Are you and Akagami in love?

00:10:02.236 --> 00:10:03.237 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:10:10.512 --> 00:10:12.547 position:24% line:89% align:start
Huh? No, we're not.

00:10:12.746 --> 00:10:13.981 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:10:15.382 --> 00:10:17.751 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why would you ask
something like that?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.189 position:19% line:83% align:start
I don't know! You just
seem a lot closer lately!

00:10:22.323 --> 00:10:24.692 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, so that's
what you were talking about?

00:10:24.825 --> 00:10:26.561 position:16% line:83% align:start
We're training partners,
you know?

00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:28.530 position:10% line:89% align:start
Of course, we get along well.

00:10:28.662 --> 00:10:30.599 position:27% line:83% align:start
I like him a lot
in that respect.

00:10:30.731 --> 00:10:31.966 position:47% line:89% align:start
My!

00:10:32.099 --> 00:10:33.200 position:38% line:89% align:start
Partners?

00:10:33.434 --> 00:10:35.736 position:16% line:83% align:start
There may have been some
misunderstandings early on,

00:10:35.870 --> 00:10:38.305 position:27% line:83% align:start
but now we've put
all that behind us.

00:10:38.439 --> 00:10:40.007 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ah. That makes sense.

00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:42.577 position:33% line:83% align:start
So it was all
in my imagination?

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:43.811 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Besides...

00:10:44.445 --> 00:10:47.915 position:19% line:83% align:start
he's an extraordinarily
handsome man, wouldn't you say?

00:10:48.182 --> 00:10:49.150 position:47% line:89% align:start
Mm?

00:10:49.283 --> 00:10:50.918 position:27% line:83% align:start
[MIA] My original
purpose in coming to

00:10:51.051 --> 00:10:53.187 position:27% line:83% align:start
Japan was to seek
spiritual training.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.223 position:19% line:83% align:start
I needed help fighting
off my worldly desires.

00:10:56.423 --> 00:10:59.594 position:21% line:83% align:start
You might say Akagami
is the ideal partner for me.

00:10:59.894 --> 00:11:02.396 position:13% line:83% align:start
Having such a good-looking
man by my side...

00:11:02.863 --> 00:11:04.865 position:13% line:89% align:start
It turns me on like crazy,

00:11:04.999 --> 00:11:07.301 position:24% line:83% align:start
bringing my desires
right to the forefront!

00:11:07.701 --> 00:11:11.305 position:7% line:83% align:start
Our meeting? I feel like it was
destined in some strange way.

00:11:11.438 --> 00:11:13.608 position:33% line:83% align:start
The truth is,
I'd gladly spend the

00:11:13.741 --> 00:11:16.010 position:30% line:83% align:start
rest of my life
right at his side!

00:11:18.012 --> 00:11:19.813 position:24% line:83% align:start
Let's proceed with
the questioning.

00:11:19.947 --> 00:11:21.448 position:27% line:89% align:start
Wait, seriously?

00:11:21.583 --> 00:11:24.985 position:33% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Kagura!
What are you tying me up for?

00:11:25.452 --> 00:11:26.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
It was destined?

00:11:26.887 --> 00:11:29.456 position:13% line:83% align:start
She'd spend the rest of her
life at his side?

00:11:30.525 --> 00:11:32.226 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's totally into him!

00:11:33.327 --> 00:11:34.728 position:24% line:89% align:start
Does Akagami know?

00:11:35.062 --> 00:11:37.131 position:10% line:89% align:start
Did he take advantage of it?

00:11:37.398 --> 00:11:39.534 position:35% line:89% align:start
And if so,

00:11:39.867 --> 00:11:42.571 position:35% line:83% align:start
what about
all the stuff he did with me?

00:11:42.803 --> 00:11:44.038 position:41% line:89% align:start
I mean,

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:45.839 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] But that's
not what's important.

00:11:45.973 --> 00:11:48.375 position:21% line:83% align:start
I think I just wanted
to see you happy.

00:11:48.510 --> 00:11:49.810 position:35% line:89% align:start
That's all

00:11:51.812 --> 00:11:53.480 position:24% line:89% align:start
He even said that.

00:11:53.615 --> 00:11:54.782 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
What's this?

00:11:54.915 --> 00:11:57.552 position:33% line:83% align:start
Why, Tsukuyo,
your face is bright red.

00:11:57.686 --> 00:11:59.153 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:11:59.286 --> 00:12:01.355 position:19% line:83% align:start
Please don't lose your
temper! It isn't like that!

00:12:02.089 --> 00:12:04.291 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'm not the least bit upset!

00:12:05.125 --> 00:12:07.728 position:7% line:83% align:start
It seems I have misinterpreted
things entirely.

00:12:07.861 --> 00:12:09.296 position:13% line:89% align:start
You'll have to forgive me.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.266 position:27% line:83% align:start
For some reason,
I was under the impression..

00:12:12.601 --> 00:12:14.368 position:19% line:89% align:start
that you were jealous.

00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:19.406 position:19% line:83% align:start
Huh? I have no feelings
for Akagami whatsoever!

00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.709 position:27% line:89% align:start
I heard my name!

00:12:20.841 --> 00:12:21.875 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:12:22.142 --> 00:12:24.445 position:33% line:83% align:start
Are you guys
playing a game or...

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.121 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akagami.

00:12:34.255 --> 00:12:35.089 position:44% line:89% align:start
Mia?

00:12:35.322 --> 00:12:37.424 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
What kind of game is this?

00:12:37.559 --> 00:12:40.361 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tsukuyo.
I don't understand this.

00:12:40.828 --> 00:12:41.762 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsukuyo?

00:12:41.895 --> 00:12:43.531 position:19% line:89% align:start
She's bright red, huh?

00:12:43.665 --> 00:12:45.332 position:21% line:89% align:start
I wonder why that is.

00:12:45.734 --> 00:12:46.900 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh, please.

00:12:47.034 --> 00:12:48.536 position:35% line:89% align:start
Look away.

00:12:48.670 --> 00:12:49.803 position:7% line:83% align:start
You mean you're doing something
that makes you want to

00:12:49.937 --> 00:12:51.640 position:19% line:89% align:start
hide your face from me?

00:12:51.772 --> 00:12:53.073 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have an idea.

00:12:53.207 --> 00:12:55.843 position:19% line:83% align:start
Would you like to join
in the fun, Akagami?

00:12:56.210 --> 00:12:57.746 position:33% line:83% align:start
I sure would.
[thud]

00:12:57.878 --> 00:12:59.547 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akagami!

00:13:00.615 --> 00:13:01.849 position:13% line:89% align:start
Since it's come to this...

00:13:01.982 --> 00:13:04.018 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll ask him about
that video directly.

00:13:04.151 --> 00:13:06.621 position:21% line:83% align:start
All right! Let's play
back the evidence!

00:13:06.755 --> 00:13:07.821 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:13:08.022 --> 00:13:10.692 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh-oh, my camera
seems to be missing.

00:13:10.824 --> 00:13:12.661 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Kagura.

00:13:12.793 --> 00:13:14.194 position:27% line:89% align:start
This your camera?

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:15.563 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kurage?

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.299 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Oh, no. That video's
way too much for her!

00:13:18.465 --> 00:13:20.669 position:33% line:83% align:start
Listen to me!
Don't press play!

00:13:20.801 --> 00:13:22.069 position:30% line:89% align:start
You mean this?

00:13:22.704 --> 00:13:24.204 position:16% line:89% align:start
Didn't I just say not to?

00:13:24.338 --> 00:13:26.508 position:13% line:89% align:start
Please, Kurage, don't look!

00:13:26.641 --> 00:13:28.208 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] Why are
they panting like that?

00:13:28.342 --> 00:13:29.910 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Will you listen
to your big sister

00:13:30.044 --> 00:13:31.680 position:19% line:89% align:start
for once in your life?

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:34.882 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] How could I have
allowed my pure little

00:13:35.015 --> 00:13:37.117 position:33% line:83% align:start
sister to be
exposed to such filth?

00:13:37.251 --> 00:13:40.287 position:16% line:83% align:start
Oh, they're playing some
kind of game. Looks fun.

00:13:40.854 --> 00:13:42.524 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Hey, what's on there?

00:13:42.657 --> 00:13:44.858 position:16% line:89% align:start
Oh, that? It's Mia and I.

00:13:44.992 --> 00:13:46.795 position:27% line:83% align:start
When we were out
in the storage shed.

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:47.928 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

00:13:48.128 --> 00:13:50.632 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? What? It's a game?

00:13:50.765 --> 00:13:51.932 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm.

00:13:52.066 --> 00:13:54.401 position:27% line:83% align:start
You see? That mat
on the ground there?

00:13:54.669 --> 00:13:55.704 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:55.869 --> 00:13:57.938 position:27% line:89% align:start
A game! Oh, good!

00:13:58.138 --> 00:13:59.840 position:10% line:89% align:start
'Cause, um, I thought they--

00:13:59.973 --> 00:14:01.842 position:27% line:89% align:start
You thought what?

00:14:02.677 --> 00:14:04.345 position:24% line:89% align:start
What did you think?

00:14:05.112 --> 00:14:07.414 position:27% line:83% align:start
Tell me what you
thought, Tsukuyo.

00:14:12.654 --> 00:14:15.824 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] I'll buy you a
strawberry parfait, too.

00:14:15.956 --> 00:14:17.224 position:33% line:89% align:start
[KURAGE] Why?

00:14:26.735 --> 00:14:28.570 position:19% line:89% align:start
We're completely broke!

00:14:30.104 --> 00:14:31.606 position:21% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Ever since
the new year, the temple

00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:33.273 position:10% line:89% align:start
has been hemorrhaging money.

00:14:33.407 --> 00:14:35.042 position:33% line:83% align:start
We've hardly
collected anything in

00:14:35.175 --> 00:14:36.910 position:30% line:83% align:start
donations from
the parishioners.

00:14:37.111 --> 00:14:38.912 position:33% line:83% align:start
Let alone set
anything aside to pay

00:14:39.046 --> 00:14:40.948 position:24% line:83% align:start
for repairs on the
principal figure.

00:14:41.348 --> 00:14:43.484 position:19% line:83% align:start
But I can't let myself
become discouraged.

00:14:43.618 --> 00:14:46.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'll do what I can
to turn things around.

00:14:47.254 --> 00:14:50.257 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll start by cutting back
on food expenses.

00:14:51.425 --> 00:14:52.560 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:14:55.095 --> 00:14:56.330 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:14:58.332 --> 00:14:59.667 position:16% line:89% align:start
Is everything all right?

00:14:59.801 --> 00:15:01.870 position:21% line:83% align:start
I just heard a young
lady screaming in here!

00:15:02.002 --> 00:15:04.405 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're out of-We're out of...

00:15:04.773 --> 00:15:06.373 position:24% line:89% align:start
We're out of rice!

00:15:07.007 --> 00:15:08.743 position:27% line:89% align:start
No, it can't be!

00:15:08.942 --> 00:15:10.377 position:16% line:89% align:start
Wait a sec, is that all?

00:15:10.512 --> 00:15:12.514 position:13% line:83% align:start
If we're out of rice, can't
we just buy some more?

00:15:13.515 --> 00:15:14.649 position:30% line:89% align:start
Normally, yes.

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:17.251 position:21% line:83% align:start
But we're flat broke
at the moment, so...

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:19.486 position:30% line:89% align:start
Aha. I gotcha.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:22.624 position:44% line:83% align:start
Well,
I wouldn't worry about it.

00:15:23.056 --> 00:15:25.359 position:30% line:83% align:start
See, Japan has
an annual tribute system.

00:15:25.827 --> 00:15:28.563 position:7% line:83% align:start
We can collect rice as tribute
from our parishioners.

00:15:28.830 --> 00:15:31.398 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Mia,
this isn't the Middle Ages.

00:15:31.766 --> 00:15:32.734 position:30% line:89% align:start
What was that?

00:15:32.867 --> 00:15:34.168 position:19% line:89% align:start
I heard some commotion.

00:15:34.301 --> 00:15:36.270 position:21% line:83% align:start
Is the young lady who
was screaming all right?

00:15:36.403 --> 00:15:39.206 position:24% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki, I'm afraid
we're out of rice.

00:15:39.674 --> 00:15:42.476 position:24% line:83% align:start
Ah. Our stockpile's
exhausted, huh?

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.480 position:33% line:83% align:start
In that case,
we'll simply collect tribute.

00:15:47.381 --> 00:15:49.416 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Huh?

00:15:49.884 --> 00:15:51.351 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
That's a real thing?

00:15:51.886 --> 00:15:54.087 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's fairly common
for temples to own a small

00:15:54.221 --> 00:15:55.890 position:21% line:83% align:start
amount of land beyond
the building itself,

00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:57.659 position:16% line:89% align:start
And ours is no exception.

00:15:57.792 --> 00:15:59.661 position:13% line:83% align:start
And the people who live on
and use that land

00:15:59.794 --> 00:16:02.196 position:16% line:83% align:start
pay us an annual tribute
in the form of rice.

00:16:02.463 --> 00:16:04.766 position:10% line:83% align:start
Kind of like a rent payment,
basically.

00:16:04.899 --> 00:16:06.433 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah, you could say that.

00:16:06.568 --> 00:16:09.236 position:13% line:83% align:start
So then, why do you collect
tribute as opposed to money?

00:16:09.671 --> 00:16:11.104 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Because
making money isn't what

00:16:11.238 --> 00:16:13.040 position:7% line:89% align:start
running a temple is all about.

00:16:13.173 --> 00:16:15.442 position:7% line:89% align:start
We help people out of kindness.

00:16:15.944 --> 00:16:17.545 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.747 position:30% line:83% align:start
Hey. Maybe it's
time you started

00:16:19.881 --> 00:16:21.883 position:27% line:83% align:start
studying a little
harder, Akagami.

00:16:22.049 --> 00:16:23.952 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I feel so defeated.

00:16:24.519 --> 00:16:26.220 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
By the way, is it all right

00:16:26.353 --> 00:16:27.354 position:10% line:89% align:start
that we came along with you?

00:16:27.488 --> 00:16:29.289 position:10% line:89% align:start
We're not intruding, are we?

00:16:29.423 --> 00:16:31.191 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Of course, it's all right.

00:16:31.358 --> 00:16:33.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
Rice is heavy, so I'm
grateful to you for the help.

00:16:34.328 --> 00:16:35.930 position:27% line:83% align:start
Besides, meeting
parishioners is an

00:16:36.063 --> 00:16:38.265 position:27% line:83% align:start
important part of
your ongoing training.

00:16:38.867 --> 00:16:40.234 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Oh, really?
-Oh, really?

00:16:40.367 --> 00:16:41.936 position:30% line:83% align:start
One of the keys
to enlightenment,

00:16:42.069 --> 00:16:45.540 position:21% line:83% align:start
the fourth one, is to
recognize all of your bonds

00:16:45.907 --> 00:16:47.174 position:21% line:89% align:start
and to treasure them.

00:16:47.307 --> 00:16:48.643 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
There are bonds connecting

00:16:48.776 --> 00:16:49.978 position:16% line:89% align:start
everyone and everything.

00:16:50.143 --> 00:16:52.514 position:30% line:83% align:start
And all of them
hold significance.

00:16:54.081 --> 00:16:56.016 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're coming to
our temple, Mia,

00:16:56.149 --> 00:16:58.252 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you're being
employed there, Akagami?

00:16:58.385 --> 00:17:00.822 position:19% line:83% align:start
Neither of these things
are mere coincidence.

00:17:01.054 --> 00:17:03.490 position:41% line:83% align:start
-I see.
-Of course.

00:17:03.625 --> 00:17:06.059 position:21% line:83% align:start
These bonds couldn't
be more important.

00:17:06.193 --> 00:17:08.362 position:16% line:83% align:start
We should always cherish
and be grateful for them.

00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:10.497 position:27% line:83% align:start
And all of those
parishioners out there?

00:17:10.632 --> 00:17:12.634 position:27% line:83% align:start
They were brought
to us at Mikazuki Temple

00:17:12.767 --> 00:17:14.002 position:24% line:89% align:start
by their own bonds!

00:17:14.234 --> 00:17:15.837 position:21% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] I'm talking
about the very people

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:17.471 position:13% line:89% align:start
our temple exists to serve.

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:20.875 position:7% line:83% align:start
We should take the time to get
to know them, don't you think?

00:17:21.009 --> 00:17:22.577 position:33% line:89% align:start
You're right.

00:17:22.710 --> 00:17:25.980 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm ready to meet some people
and express some gratitude!

00:17:26.113 --> 00:17:27.147 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah!

00:17:27.615 --> 00:17:30.585 position:21% line:83% align:start
I ain't got no rice.
Get outta here.

00:17:35.155 --> 00:17:36.758 position:24% line:89% align:start
[doorbell ringing]

00:17:37.157 --> 00:17:39.059 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MAN]
Go away.

00:17:41.328 --> 00:17:42.597 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
Yuzuki!

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:44.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Let's try the next place.

00:17:44.866 --> 00:17:47.035 position:35% line:83% align:start
[chuckling]
A tribute these days?

00:17:47.167 --> 00:17:49.069 position:24% line:89% align:start
That's a good one.

00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:51.171 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
We're here for the rice, sir.

00:17:51.305 --> 00:17:53.473 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-[AKAGAMI] The rice!

00:17:53.608 --> 00:17:54.642 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:17:55.208 --> 00:17:56.544 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sure, I've got
some rice for you,

00:17:56.678 --> 00:17:58.078 position:10% line:89% align:start
if you clean my house for me.

00:17:58.211 --> 00:17:59.346 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI, MIA, YUZUKI]
Huh?!

00:17:59.479 --> 00:18:02.550 position:27% line:83% align:start
Our bonds led us
here, did they? Huh?

00:18:02.684 --> 00:18:03.518 position:38% line:89% align:start
Now, now.

00:18:03.751 --> 00:18:07.154 position:38% line:83% align:start
[screams]
The closet just exploded!

00:18:09.791 --> 00:18:10.792 position:30% line:89% align:start
After all that?

00:18:10.925 --> 00:18:12.927 position:33% line:83% align:start
We never got
a single grain of rice.

00:18:13.061 --> 00:18:14.428 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah, well.

00:18:14.562 --> 00:18:16.163 position:38% line:83% align:start
Normally,
our parishioners would have

00:18:16.296 --> 00:18:17.832 position:30% line:83% align:start
their tributes
delivered to the temple.

00:18:17.966 --> 00:18:20.367 position:27% line:83% align:start
The places we've
visited today haven't done so

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:22.402 position:10% line:89% align:start
due to various circumstances.

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.006 position:10% line:83% align:start
They're behind on their rent,
is what you're saying?

00:18:25.138 --> 00:18:27.742 position:21% line:89% align:start
Well. I guess, yeah.

00:18:28.342 --> 00:18:31.178 position:16% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Anyway. One more
house to go, all right?

00:18:31.378 --> 00:18:33.246 position:16% line:89% align:start
Let's keep our chins up!

00:18:35.049 --> 00:18:36.517 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's good to see you, Yuzuki.

00:18:36.651 --> 00:18:38.485 position:13% line:89% align:start
Thanks for coming out here.

00:18:38.620 --> 00:18:40.588 position:10% line:89% align:start
And thank you for having us.

00:18:40.722 --> 00:18:41.823 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:43.725 position:16% line:83% align:start
Although I don't believe
I recognize these two.

00:18:44.092 --> 00:18:47.260 position:21% line:83% align:start
Sorry to trouble you,
but I'm nursing a broken leg.

00:18:48.261 --> 00:18:49.998 position:30% line:83% align:start
Oh, the rice is
sitting in the yard.

00:18:50.130 --> 00:18:51.833 position:16% line:89% align:start
Take as much as you like.

00:18:52.567 --> 00:18:53.735 position:35% line:83% align:start
-A goddess!
-A goddess!

00:18:53.868 --> 00:18:55.168 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? A goddess?

00:18:55.302 --> 00:18:57.038 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do I look that good?

00:18:57.170 --> 00:18:58.706 position:27% line:89% align:start
[nervous chuckle]

Oh. What adorable children.

[ASAHI]
Hey, Mom!

00:19:03.077 --> 00:19:03.978 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:04.112 --> 00:19:05.079 position:27% line:89% align:start
What's going on?

00:19:05.212 --> 00:19:07.548 position:16% line:89% align:start
Hey! It's Big Sis Yuzuki!

00:19:07.982 --> 00:19:09.017 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hi. There.

00:19:09.149 --> 00:19:10.718 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, look! How cute!

00:19:10.852 --> 00:19:11.919 position:33% line:89% align:start
[KIDS] Hello!

00:19:12.252 --> 00:19:14.154 position:27% line:83% align:start
So, who wants to
play a little game?

00:19:14.287 --> 00:19:15.757 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Me!
-Me!

00:19:15.890 --> 00:19:18.492 position:7% line:83% align:start
[TENDOU] Now, children, Yuzuki
has work to do right now.

00:19:18.626 --> 00:19:19.493 position:41% line:89% align:start
Then...

00:19:19.627 --> 00:19:21.161 position:19% line:89% align:start
let us see your boobs!

00:19:21.294 --> 00:19:22.530 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way.

00:19:22.664 --> 00:19:23.463 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[chanting] Let us see!
-They ask me that

00:19:23.598 --> 00:19:24.932 position:24% line:89% align:start
every time I visit.

00:19:25.066 --> 00:19:26.199 position:30% line:89% align:start
What can I say?

00:19:26.333 --> 00:19:28.435 position:24% line:83% align:start
These two are crazy
about boobs.

00:19:29.469 --> 00:19:31.238 position:7% line:83% align:start
But why are they so interested
in them?

00:19:31.371 --> 00:19:33.240 position:21% line:83% align:start
The real question is,
who wouldn't be?

00:19:33.373 --> 00:19:34.976 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[screams]
-Akagami!

00:19:35.943 --> 00:19:39.379 position:7% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]Can it be? Am I on the
same level as these children?

00:19:40.848 --> 00:19:43.350 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'm very disappointed
in you two.

00:19:43.483 --> 00:19:46.486 position:27% line:83% align:start
This behavior is
totally unacceptable!

00:19:46.621 --> 00:19:47.755 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Oh...
-Oh...

00:19:47.922 --> 00:19:49.791 position:27% line:83% align:start
You have to fight
against these desires.

00:19:49.924 --> 00:19:52.492 position:19% line:83% align:start
That's how you grow up
to be a decent adult.

00:19:52.927 --> 00:19:54.128 position:44% line:89% align:start
Okay.

00:19:54.261 --> 00:19:55.897 position:16% line:89% align:start
We understand now, miss.

00:19:56.030 --> 00:19:57.264 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm glad to hear that.

00:19:57.397 --> 00:19:58.566 position:33% line:89% align:start
In that case,

00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.069 position:33% line:83% align:start
let us see a
decent adult's boobs!

00:20:01.201 --> 00:20:02.970 position:16% line:89% align:start
That was your take-away?!

00:20:03.236 --> 00:20:05.506 position:21% line:89% align:start
[children clamoring]

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.642 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, dear. Let me help Mia.

00:20:07.775 --> 00:20:08.910 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hey, kids!

00:20:09.143 --> 00:20:12.113 position:19% line:83% align:start
You're Akagami, right?
Yuzuki's told me about you.

00:20:12.245 --> 00:20:13.447 position:27% line:89% align:start
Right. I'm sorry,

00:20:13.581 --> 00:20:15.717 position:7% line:83% align:start
I should have introduced myself
earlier.

00:20:16.017 --> 00:20:17.585 position:10% line:89% align:start
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:20:18.986 --> 00:20:21.622 position:19% line:83% align:start
[TENDOU] I'm sorry it's
such a madhouse around here.

00:20:21.956 --> 00:20:23.290 position:27% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Please,
you should have seen

00:20:23.423 --> 00:20:25.093 position:35% line:83% align:start
how things
went with the others!

00:20:25.425 --> 00:20:26.794 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TENDOU]
They gave you trouble?

00:20:27.128 --> 00:20:30.363 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'll say. I don't mind if I
never see them again.

00:20:31.199 --> 00:20:32.800 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're all right, Akagami!

00:20:33.067 --> 00:20:35.670 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know, it never
used to be like that.

00:20:36.369 --> 00:20:37.672 position:30% line:89% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Huh?

00:20:37.805 --> 00:20:39.239 position:16% line:83% align:start
[TENDOU] Back in the days
when Yuzuki's mother

00:20:39.372 --> 00:20:40.742 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tsukina was still around,

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:43.443 position:27% line:83% align:start
nobody would have
dared fail to pay tribute.

00:20:44.377 --> 00:20:47.347 position:16% line:89% align:start
Boy, was she terrifying!

00:20:47.582 --> 00:20:50.017 position:24% line:83% align:start
That lady hit me on
more than one occasion.

00:20:50.218 --> 00:20:51.351 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Huh?

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:53.788 position:21% line:83% align:start
But she also made us
feel secure.

00:20:54.655 --> 00:20:56.289 position:21% line:89% align:start
Now that she's gone,

00:20:56.423 --> 00:20:58.893 position:24% line:83% align:start
I think everyone's
feeling a bit anxious.

00:20:59.727 --> 00:21:02.964 position:16% line:83% align:start
Wondering what the future
holds for Mikazuki Temple.

00:21:03.798 --> 00:21:04.565 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:21:04.699 --> 00:21:06.266 position:19% line:89% align:start
Any idea why she left?

00:21:06.399 --> 00:21:07.869 position:27% line:89% align:start
I'm not entirely

00:21:08.002 --> 00:21:10.337 position:21% line:83% align:start
clear on the details,
but I believe she's stationed

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.140 position:19% line:89% align:start
at the main temple now.

00:21:12.272 --> 00:21:13.775 position:44% line:83% align:start

Akagami!

00:21:19.247 --> 00:21:20.581 position:41% line:83% align:start
[ASAHI]
Now those are boobs!

00:21:20.715 --> 00:21:21.949 position:13% line:89% align:start
[HINATA] Man, is he lucky!

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:24.752 position:30% line:83% align:start
[TENDOU] Enough
already, you pervy brats!

00:21:25.418 --> 00:21:27.155 position:13% line:89% align:start
Sorry again for the mayhem.

00:21:27.387 --> 00:21:29.557 position:27% line:83% align:start
This doesn't make
up for it, but...

00:21:31.726 --> 00:21:33.661 position:19% line:89% align:start
That is a lot of rice.

00:21:33.895 --> 00:21:35.797 position:27% line:83% align:start
[TENDOU] They are
heavy, so be careful.

00:21:36.264 --> 00:21:38.298 position:35% line:89% align:start
[straining]

00:21:38.465 --> 00:21:40.367 position:13% line:89% align:start
Heavy's an understatement.

00:21:40.701 --> 00:21:41.502 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:21:41.636 --> 00:21:43.370 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Hold on.

00:21:43.504 --> 00:21:46.741 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yeah. I thought
they seemed familiar

00:21:49.277 --> 00:21:50.845 position:35% line:89% align:start
How funny.

00:21:51.344 --> 00:21:53.714 position:19% line:89% align:start
Akagami? What's wrong?

00:21:53.848 --> 00:21:55.082 position:38% line:89% align:start
I'm fine.

00:21:55.415 --> 00:21:57.952 position:35% line:83% align:start
I just felt
the sense of destiny.

00:22:00.822 --> 00:22:02.023 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:22:02.256 --> 00:22:04.792 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] That's right. I
should be grateful I met Yuzuki

00:22:05.092 --> 00:22:07.562 position:27% line:83% align:start
and do everything
I can to support her.

00:22:08.196 --> 00:22:09.230 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hup!

00:22:09.864 --> 00:22:12.332 position:13% line:89% align:start
Well? You all ready to go?

00:22:14.401 --> 00:22:16.469 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're so strong, Yuzuki!

00:22:16.771 --> 00:22:18.906 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Not that she needs my support.

00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.036 position:16% line:89% align:start
Tell me about your dream.

00:23:55.169 --> 00:23:57.437 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, Akagami was
hanging loose in it.

00:23:57.571 --> 00:23:58.839 position:41% line:89% align:start
How so?

00:23:58.973 --> 00:24:01.042 position:16% line:83% align:start
Actually, you and Yuzuki
were hanging loose, too.

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:02.475 position:41% line:89% align:start
How so?

00:24:02.610 --> 00:24:05.212 position:24% line:83% align:start
Just hanging loose
and spreading the love!

00:24:05.346 --> 00:24:07.014 position:30% line:89% align:start
You don't say.
