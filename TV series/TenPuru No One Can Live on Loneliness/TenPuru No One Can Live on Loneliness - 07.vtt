[KIKI] Today,
our preparations for tokudo

00:00:11.845 --> 00:00:13.281 position:19% line:89% align:start
will begin in earnest.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.249 position:24% line:89% align:start
Is everybody ready?

00:00:15.383 --> 00:00:16.449 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Yes!

00:00:16.951 --> 00:00:19.387 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Ready to teach
that rotten priest a lesson?

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.354 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[BOTH] Yes!
-Huh?

00:00:20.487 --> 00:00:22.489 position:16% line:89% align:start
Now, what color are they?

00:00:22.856 --> 00:00:25.192 position:21% line:89% align:start
Your undies, that is.

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.898 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are they white
or something else?

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:35.036 position:16% line:83% align:start
Um, Kiki? Can you please
take this seriously?

00:00:35.169 --> 00:00:37.138 position:30% line:89% align:start
Trust me, I am.

00:00:37.271 --> 00:00:38.538 position:13% line:89% align:start
The point of this training

00:00:38.672 --> 00:00:40.507 position:33% line:83% align:start
is to become
a metaphorical blank white slate

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.043 position:27% line:89% align:start
in mind and body.

The rules are stringent.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:46.613 position:19% line:89% align:start
Even for undergarments,

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:49.350 position:10% line:83% align:start
they must always be unadorned
and plain white.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:53.387 position:13% line:83% align:start
Well, I've only got boxers
and they're not white.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.821 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'm washing my whites.

00:00:54.956 --> 00:00:57.258 position:24% line:83% align:start

Red and black? All of it?

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:00.694 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yeah. Why?

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:02.662 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is there something
unusual about that?

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.632 position:16% line:89% align:start
So, none of you have any.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:07.034 position:19% line:89% align:start
No other choice, then.

00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:09.469 position:27% line:83% align:start
Today, you three
will undergo your training

00:01:09.602 --> 00:01:11.471 position:33% line:83% align:start

known as "commando."

What an outrageous situation!

00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.773 position:10% line:83% align:start
Doesn't all this bother you,
too, Yuzuki?

[YUZUKI] I... I mean...
Sure, it's embarrassing,

00:02:57.244 --> 00:02:59.779 position:16% line:83% align:start
but I can get through it
for the sake of my training.

Thank you so much.
Truly hate you.

[KIKI]
Wow, that's an impressive trick.

00:03:10.958 --> 00:03:12.792 position:19% line:89% align:start
We'll begin with zazen.

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:17.298 position:19% line:83% align:start
Straighten your posture
and try to relax your mind.

Whatever thoughts
may enter your head,

you mustn't let yourself
become distracted.

Wonderful.

This is exactly the kind
of training I was hoping for.

00:03:37.418 --> 00:03:40.653 position:21% line:83% align:start
Mouth loosely closed,
eyes half-open.

This is zazen...

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.241 position:44% line:83% align:start
Freed
from all worldly thoughts.

00:04:00.374 --> 00:04:01.609 position:38% line:89% align:start
At peace.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.044 position:30% line:83% align:start
Sensing the air
as it flows around me.

00:04:05.778 --> 00:04:07.581 position:13% line:89% align:start
So this is what it's like,

Today, I'm thinking
of switching things up

you've put in thus far.

By confronting
your worldly desires,

00:08:25.672 --> 00:08:28.842 position:13% line:83% align:start
you'll develop a resistance
to the opposite sex.

it's so bright in here,

This may be kind of
a weird question,

together count as training?

How did you sleep, Akagami?

Well, since you asked,
the truth is...

these worldly thoughts go away?

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:46.179 position:19% line:83% align:start
Soon, Yuzuki will grow
disgusted with me

What Kiki's goal is here.

00:10:57.324 --> 00:11:00.460 position:10% line:83% align:start
Of course. What she wants us
to experience...

to Yuzuki's head.

00:11:07.734 --> 00:11:10.905 position:13% line:83% align:start
Or else, I drove her crazy
by being too annoying!

I'll explain!

[MALE PRIEST 07A] Holy am I,
alone in heaven and earth.

00:11:16.643 --> 00:11:18.545 position:19% line:83% align:start
Now, what was I saying?
Anyway--

00:11:18.679 --> 00:11:20.514 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
"Makyo" is a Buddhist term.

00:11:20.647 --> 00:11:22.382 position:33% line:83% align:start
It describes
the state of excitement

00:11:22.516 --> 00:11:25.118 position:10% line:83% align:start
that occurs when your latent
worldly thoughts and desires

00:11:25.252 --> 00:11:26.486 position:13% line:89% align:start
come rushing to the surface

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:28.555 position:30% line:83% align:start
during a period
of intense training.

If you can overcome it,

00:11:35.063 --> 00:11:37.731 position:10% line:83% align:start
you'll cease to be controlled
by your worldly thoughts!

00:11:37.864 --> 00:11:39.299 position:41% line:89% align:start
Really?

00:11:39.433 --> 00:11:41.201 position:5% line:83% align:start

Kiki wanted us to have

00:11:41.335 --> 00:11:42.736 position:10% line:89% align:start
when she sent us all in here!

00:11:42.869 --> 00:11:44.371 position:30% line:89% align:start
Yeah, probably.

00:11:44.504 --> 00:11:47.008 position:24% line:83% align:start

about the things I saw
at the love hotel,

replaying in my head.

my thoughts

about what might've happened
there.

No way.

00:12:26.146 --> 00:12:27.781 position:30% line:89% align:start
You know what?

00:12:28.983 --> 00:12:31.451 position:16% line:89% align:start
I kinda don't think I...

You don't?

00:12:33.988 --> 00:12:35.255 position:19% line:89% align:start
You've surpassed makyo

Yeah. Thanks.

This has nothing
to do with our training.

00:12:51.838 --> 00:12:54.108 position:19% line:83% align:start
It's a personal problem
I have to work through

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:55.475 position:35% line:89% align:start
on my own.

00:12:56.144 --> 00:12:58.079 position:10% line:89% align:start
Besides, how can I tell them

00:12:58.211 --> 00:13:00.514 position:21% line:83% align:start
that their closeness
makes me feel...

00:13:00.781 --> 00:13:01.748 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:13:03.784 --> 00:13:05.519 position:41% line:89% align:start
uneasy?

00:13:06.219 --> 00:13:07.521 position:27% line:89% align:start
Very well, then.

00:13:07.654 --> 00:13:09.924 position:33% line:83% align:start
The approach
may have been a bit unorthodox,

00:13:10.058 --> 00:13:11.792 position:5% line:89% align:start
but it seems to have worked out.

00:13:11.926 --> 00:13:13.061 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Yes!

00:13:13.627 --> 00:13:15.729 position:7% line:83% align:start
I think I have a better handle
on my worldly thoughts now.

00:13:15.862 --> 00:13:18.398 position:41% line:83% align:start
Really?
That's encouraging to hear.

00:13:18.532 --> 00:13:20.200 position:16% line:83% align:start
Even if you should reach
enlightenment,

00:13:20.333 --> 00:13:22.170 position:33% line:83% align:start
your worldly
thoughts will never go away.

00:13:22.302 --> 00:13:23.637 position:19% line:89% align:start
And that, my children,

00:13:23.770 --> 00:13:26.140 position:21% line:83% align:start
is why it's important
to face them directly.

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:28.042 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes, understood.

00:13:28.176 --> 00:13:30.644 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Of course, there are
those who will claim to be free

00:13:30.777 --> 00:13:32.713 position:19% line:83% align:start
of any worldly thoughts
whatsoever.

00:13:32.846 --> 00:13:34.214 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:13:34.347 --> 00:13:37.684 position:10% line:83% align:start
And those people are secretly
the biggest perverts of all.

00:13:39.987 --> 00:13:41.688 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:13:43.490 --> 00:13:45.258 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
It's not true!

00:13:45.392 --> 00:13:47.260 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm not a pervert!

00:13:51.832 --> 00:13:52.766 position:38% line:89% align:start
[grunts]

00:13:59.073 --> 00:14:00.273 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:14:03.744 --> 00:14:05.679 position:7% line:89% align:start
You're all coming along nicely.

00:14:05.812 --> 00:14:07.982 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's so kind of you to say.

00:14:08.116 --> 00:14:09.217 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:14:09.349 --> 00:14:10.584 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:14:11.953 --> 00:14:13.854 position:27% line:83% align:start
Why don't we take
the afternoon off?

00:14:13.988 --> 00:14:15.189 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:14:15.322 --> 00:14:16.623 position:30% line:83% align:start
-But why, Kiki?
-Yeah, why would we?

00:14:16.757 --> 00:14:18.192 position:21% line:83% align:start
We were just starting
to find our groove.

00:14:18.325 --> 00:14:20.228 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
And that's wonderful.

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:21.661 position:13% line:89% align:start
But push yourself too hard,

00:14:21.795 --> 00:14:23.830 position:27% line:83% align:start
and you'll suffer
in the long run.

00:14:23.965 --> 00:14:24.831 position:30% line:89% align:start
Still, though.

00:14:25.099 --> 00:14:27.168 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
"Set aside fame and fortune."

00:14:27.300 --> 00:14:29.870 position:7% line:89% align:start
I trust you understand, Yuzuki?

00:14:33.174 --> 00:14:34.741 position:30% line:83% align:start
[MIA, AKAGAMI]
Uh... Huh?

00:14:34.875 --> 00:14:37.178 position:38% line:83% align:start
She said,
"Set aside fame and fortune."

00:14:37.310 --> 00:14:40.214 position:13% line:83% align:start
It basically means to stop
worrying about gains and losses

00:14:40.347 --> 00:14:41.448 position:10% line:89% align:start
and that which surrounds you,

00:14:41.581 --> 00:14:43.217 position:38% line:83% align:start
and focus
on your personal needs.

00:14:43.350 --> 00:14:45.318 position:27% line:83% align:start
For our purposes,
we can categorize it

00:14:45.452 --> 00:14:47.287 position:27% line:83% align:start
as the third key
to enlightenment.

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:48.688 position:10% line:89% align:start
Or, to put it in another way,

00:14:48.822 --> 00:14:50.958 position:10% line:83% align:start
resting is an important part
of our training.

00:14:51.259 --> 00:14:52.526 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll hang out with Kagura,

00:14:52.659 --> 00:14:54.828 position:21% line:83% align:start
since I haven't seen
much of her lately.

00:14:55.529 --> 00:14:56.830 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Oh, man.

00:14:57.965 --> 00:15:01.035 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
Kiki gave us today off.

00:15:01.802 --> 00:15:04.205 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on,
am I missing something, here?

00:15:04.337 --> 00:15:05.973 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Today is December 24th.

00:15:06.107 --> 00:15:07.208 position:19% line:89% align:start
[footsteps approaching]

00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:09.143 position:30% line:83% align:start
Otherwise known
as Christmas Eve.

00:15:09.277 --> 00:15:12.345 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, Akagami,
does Christmas bother you, or--

00:15:12.479 --> 00:15:13.780 position:27% line:89% align:start
[glasses shatter]

00:15:13.915 --> 00:15:15.983 position:16% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Every Christmas
during my childhood,

00:15:16.117 --> 00:15:18.585 position:24% line:83% align:start
my father would try
to divide his time equally

00:15:18.718 --> 00:15:20.520 position:21% line:89% align:start
among all his lovers.

00:15:20.654 --> 00:15:24.791 position:19% line:83% align:start
And every single year,
it culminated in a bloodbath.

00:15:24.926 --> 00:15:27.360 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Oh, that sounds awful.

00:15:27.494 --> 00:15:30.932 position:24% line:83% align:start
Christmas is pain.
Christmas is terror.

00:15:31.065 --> 00:15:32.066 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.466 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Well, uh...

00:15:33.667 --> 00:15:36.003 position:7% line:89% align:start
If that's how you feel, then...

00:15:36.137 --> 00:15:37.305 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:15:37.437 --> 00:15:39.307 position:24% line:83% align:start
Why don't we go out
for a little bit?

00:15:39.439 --> 00:15:40.574 position:30% line:89% align:start
Just you and I!

âª

00:15:45.112 --> 00:15:46.379 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
By the way,

00:15:46.513 --> 00:15:47.848 position:27% line:83% align:start
we're all having
a Christmas party tomorrow.

00:15:47.982 --> 00:15:50.383 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Huh? At the temple?

00:15:50.517 --> 00:15:51.919 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yeah, where did you think?

00:15:52.053 --> 00:15:54.354 position:10% line:83% align:start
We'll be exchanging presents
as well,

00:15:54.487 --> 00:15:55.889 position:5% line:89% align:start
so let's pick ours out together!

00:15:56.023 --> 00:15:59.459 position:30% line:83% align:start
Right! Got it!
It sounds good to me! A-OK!

00:15:59.593 --> 00:16:01.494 position:5% line:89% align:start
What is wrong with you, Akagami?

00:16:01.628 --> 00:16:03.630 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Going out together
on Christmas Eve?

00:16:03.763 --> 00:16:05.498 position:13% line:89% align:start
That's way too meaningful!

00:16:05.632 --> 00:16:07.868 position:7% line:89% align:start
And with Yuzuki, of all people.

00:16:08.002 --> 00:16:08.802 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

[grunts]

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:11.404 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKDAGAMI]
Christmas music.

00:16:11.538 --> 00:16:12.873 position:13% line:89% align:start
Colorful lights everywhere.

00:16:13.007 --> 00:16:15.109 position:16% line:83% align:start
The entire town caught up
in the spirit of peace

00:16:15.243 --> 00:16:16.610 position:33% line:89% align:start
and goodwill.

00:16:16.743 --> 00:16:19.546 position:21% line:83% align:start
What a bunch of crap!
Nice try, Christmas Eve!

00:16:19.679 --> 00:16:20.881 position:10% line:89% align:start
But it'll take more than that

if you want to bend me
to your will!

Come on! Let's get going!

00:16:25.253 --> 00:16:26.553 position:44% line:89% align:start

[panting]

00:16:48.142 --> 00:16:50.744 position:21% line:83% align:start
So this is the power
of Christmas Eve.

00:16:50.877 --> 00:16:53.880 position:24% line:83% align:start
I can see I'll need
a great deal more training.

-Have you found anything?
-Huh?

Oh. Not yet.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:00.054 position:10% line:83% align:start
Actually, I'm not quite sure
what I'm looking for.

[laughs]

00:17:01.554 --> 00:17:02.522 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not something
you really need to think

00:17:02.656 --> 00:17:04.125 position:10% line:89% align:start
all that hard about. [laughs]

00:17:04.258 --> 00:17:05.458 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, it isn't?

00:17:05.792 --> 00:17:07.995 position:27% line:83% align:start
A present can be
whatever you want it to be.

00:17:08.129 --> 00:17:10.830 position:19% line:83% align:start
All that really matters
is the feeling behind it.

00:17:11.299 --> 00:17:12.465 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:12.866 --> 00:17:13.600 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh.

00:17:13.733 --> 00:17:14.902 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh! You know what?

00:17:15.036 --> 00:17:16.337 position:30% line:83% align:start
I just thought
of the perfect shop

00:17:16.469 --> 00:17:17.704 position:19% line:89% align:start
for us to go check out!

00:17:17.837 --> 00:17:18.973 position:47% line:89% align:start
Oh.

00:17:19.106 --> 00:17:20.874 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:17:21.741 --> 00:17:23.777 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
"Buddhist goods", eh?

00:17:23.911 --> 00:17:24.946 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yep.

00:17:25.079 --> 00:17:27.181 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's run by my friend's family.

00:17:27.315 --> 00:17:28.648 position:10% line:89% align:start
They sell a lot of stuff here

00:17:28.782 --> 00:17:30.284 position:21% line:83% align:start
that we use every day
at the temple,

00:17:30.418 --> 00:17:32.585 position:13% line:83% align:start
so I figured this would be
a pretty good place to look.

00:17:32.719 --> 00:17:35.089 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh. Good idea.

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:39.492 position:24% line:89% align:start
Ooh, prayer beads.

00:17:39.626 --> 00:17:41.062 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Buying some as a gift?

00:17:41.195 --> 00:17:43.064 position:24% line:83% align:start
No, just realizing,
I don't have any.

00:17:43.197 --> 00:17:44.664 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:17:44.798 --> 00:17:47.234 position:7% line:83% align:start
Ah! Yeah, I actually only have
informal beads myself.

00:17:47.368 --> 00:17:48.601 position:38% line:89% align:start
Informal?

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.939 position:7% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] There are both formal
and informal prayer beads.

00:17:52.073 --> 00:17:54.808 position:16% line:83% align:start
The formal kind are used
for important occasions,

00:17:54.942 --> 00:17:57.144 position:16% line:83% align:start
like the tokudo ceremony,
for instance.

00:17:57.278 --> 00:17:58.678 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Gotcha.

00:17:59.013 --> 00:18:00.147 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah.

00:18:00.281 --> 00:18:02.316 position:16% line:83% align:start
However, those tend to be
on the expensive side.

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:03.918 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:18:04.051 --> 00:18:05.419 position:7% line:83% align:start
So, I'll likely have to borrow
Kiki's or my parents'

00:18:05.552 --> 00:18:07.620 position:16% line:83% align:start
-for my tokudo ceremony.
-[AKAGAMI] I see.

00:18:07.754 --> 00:18:09.856 position:38% line:83% align:start
But soon
I'll become a proper priest,

00:18:09.991 --> 00:18:12.726 position:16% line:83% align:start
and when that time comes,
I'll buy my own beads.

00:18:13.995 --> 00:18:15.628 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MARI
Why wait till the time comes?

00:18:15.762 --> 00:18:17.064 position:24% line:89% align:start
Buy them right now.

00:18:17.198 --> 00:18:19.833 position:30% line:83% align:start
-[YUZUKI] Mari!
-How goes it, Yuzukin?

00:18:19.967 --> 00:18:21.969 position:21% line:89% align:start
It's good to see you!

00:18:22.103 --> 00:18:23.237 position:27% line:89% align:start
This is Akagami.

00:18:23.371 --> 00:18:24.671 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hello there.

00:18:24.804 --> 00:18:27.441 position:10% line:83% align:start
-And this is my friend, Mari.
-A pleasure.

00:18:27.574 --> 00:18:29.310 position:21% line:83% align:start
If it's prayer beads
you're after,

00:18:29.443 --> 00:18:30.844 position:16% line:89% align:start
we've got some nice ones.

00:18:30.978 --> 00:18:33.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
Aren't these "his-and-hers"
prayer beads lovely?

00:18:33.948 --> 00:18:36.250 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Huh?
They have something like that?

00:18:36.384 --> 00:18:37.650 position:35% line:89% align:start
Of course.

00:18:37.784 --> 00:18:39.987 position:16% line:83% align:start
In fact, during Buddhist
wedding ceremonies,

00:18:40.121 --> 00:18:42.957 position:21% line:83% align:start
the couple exchanges
prayer beads rather than rings.

00:18:43.090 --> 00:18:44.191 position:38% line:89% align:start
They do?

00:18:44.325 --> 00:18:46.460 position:21% line:83% align:start
I suppose that isn't
a widely known fact, huh?

00:18:46.593 --> 00:18:47.995 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
Just so you know,

00:18:48.129 --> 00:18:50.197 position:24% line:83% align:start
we've got all kinds
of prayer beads for couples.

00:18:50.331 --> 00:18:52.066 position:33% line:83% align:start
Some are even
said to aid in fertility.

00:18:52.199 --> 00:18:55.102 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is there a particular reason
you're telling us this?

00:18:55.236 --> 00:18:56.971 position:19% line:83% align:start
Well, you are a couple,
aren't you?

00:18:57.104 --> 00:18:58.538 position:41% line:83% align:start
-We...
-Actually, no.

00:18:58.671 --> 00:19:00.908 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not like that
between us at all, okay?

00:19:01.042 --> 00:19:02.176 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:19:02.309 --> 00:19:04.711 position:7% line:83% align:start
And yet, here you are together
on Christmas Eve.

00:19:04.844 --> 00:19:07.181 position:35% line:83% align:start
Sure seems
a lot like a date to me.

00:19:07.314 --> 00:19:09.616 position:24% line:89% align:start
[AKAGAMI grunting]

00:19:09.749 --> 00:19:11.152 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Huh?

00:19:11.952 --> 00:19:13.087 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:19:14.321 --> 00:19:15.289 position:35% line:89% align:start
[whimpers]

00:19:15.423 --> 00:19:16.589 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Huh?!

00:19:16.723 --> 00:19:18.192 position:27% line:83% align:start
This whole time,
it never occurred to her?

00:19:18.325 --> 00:19:19.592 position:38% line:89% align:start
Um, look.

00:19:19.726 --> 00:19:22.396 position:35% line:83% align:start
This, uh...
This isn't a romantic thing.

00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:24.532 position:30% line:89% align:start
For real? Hmm?

00:19:24.664 --> 00:19:25.698 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not at all?

00:19:25.832 --> 00:19:27.134 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
No.

00:19:27.268 --> 00:19:29.403 position:19% line:83% align:start
Okay. But you'd better
tell Yuzukin's face,

00:19:29.537 --> 00:19:30.670 position:5% line:89% align:start
because it just turned beet red.

00:19:30.804 --> 00:19:31.704 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:19:31.838 --> 00:19:33.507 position:13% line:89% align:start
Don't look at me, Akagami!

00:19:34.241 --> 00:19:36.743 position:21% line:83% align:start
[MARI] And check out
how dolled-up she got for this.

00:19:36.876 --> 00:19:38.279 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
No!

00:19:38.412 --> 00:19:39.813 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MARI] Normally, she keeps
her look pretty casual...

00:19:39.947 --> 00:19:41.549 position:30% line:89% align:start
[YUZUKI grunts]

00:19:41.681 --> 00:19:44.118 position:7% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] whereas today, it looks
like she's even got makeup on.

00:19:44.251 --> 00:19:45.419 position:33% line:89% align:start
[whimpering]

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.587 position:24% line:83% align:start
I know something's
making her happy lately,

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:48.822 position:19% line:83% align:start
-'cause she's gained--
-[YUZUKI] Mari!

00:19:48.956 --> 00:19:50.324 position:10% line:89% align:start
Could you ring me up, please?

00:19:50.458 --> 00:19:51.992 position:41% line:83% align:start
[MARI]
I'd love to.

00:19:52.126 --> 00:19:54.594 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Just for the record,
it's really not like that!

00:19:54.727 --> 00:19:57.398 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[MARI] If you say so.
-[YUZUKI] Mari!

00:19:57.531 --> 00:19:58.898 position:44% line:89% align:start
Oh...

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:02.635 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Any luck
with the gift shopping, Akagami?

00:20:02.769 --> 00:20:05.039 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yes. All thanks to you.

00:20:05.172 --> 00:20:06.540 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:20:06.673 --> 00:20:08.943 position:19% line:89% align:start
Good! Glad to hear it.

00:20:09.076 --> 00:20:10.277 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:20:10.411 --> 00:20:12.046 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Wait a minute.

00:20:12.846 --> 00:20:15.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
Was all this Yuzuki's way
of cheering me up?

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:18.385 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:20:19.053 --> 00:20:22.056 position:21% line:83% align:start
You know, I'm getting
pretty excited for tomorrow.

00:20:22.189 --> 00:20:25.259 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI giggles]
Yeah, same here, Akagami.

00:20:27.461 --> 00:20:28.795 position:38% line:89% align:start
[biting]

00:20:28.929 --> 00:20:31.798 position:30% line:83% align:start
I can't believe
it's Christmas time already.

00:20:31.932 --> 00:20:34.435 position:33% line:83% align:start
The year flew
by before we knew it.

00:20:34.568 --> 00:20:36.003 position:16% line:89% align:start
Guess we were distracted

00:20:36.137 --> 00:20:38.072 position:7% line:83% align:start
by how hectic things have been
around here lately.

00:20:38.205 --> 00:20:40.341 position:19% line:83% align:start
There's definitely been
a lot of change,

00:20:40.474 --> 00:20:43.344 position:13% line:83% align:start
my progression to adulthood
being the most obvious example.

00:20:43.477 --> 00:20:47.047 position:16% line:83% align:start
Eh, I'd say the one who's
changed the most is Mia, though.

00:20:47.181 --> 00:20:50.050 position:10% line:83% align:start
Aw, are you trying to tell me
my training's paying off?

00:20:50.184 --> 00:20:51.352 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
You got sexier.

00:20:51.485 --> 00:20:53.053 position:19% line:89% align:start
What did you just say?!

00:20:53.187 --> 00:20:55.022 position:13% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] You used to seem
like such an uptight person.

00:20:55.156 --> 00:20:56.457 position:44% line:83% align:start
[MIA]
I'll punish him with castration.

00:20:56.590 --> 00:20:58.758 position:27% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] But now,
you're completely different.

00:20:58.892 --> 00:21:01.162 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Your clothes have changed a lot.

00:21:01.295 --> 00:21:02.762 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE]
There's a much greater emphasis

00:21:02.896 --> 00:21:04.231 position:30% line:89% align:start
on your curves.

00:21:04.365 --> 00:21:06.033 position:33% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Listen,
it's not what you might think!

00:21:06.167 --> 00:21:07.134 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:21:07.268 --> 00:21:07.968 position:33% line:89% align:start
Sorry, sorry.

00:21:08.102 --> 00:21:09.470 position:16% line:89% align:start
It's a good look on you,

00:21:09.603 --> 00:21:11.372 position:10% line:83% align:start
and I'm sure there's nothing
indecent about it.

00:21:11.505 --> 00:21:15.342 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm simply trying to entice
Akagami to look at my chest!

00:21:15.476 --> 00:21:16.676 position:24% line:89% align:start
So it is indecent!

00:21:16.809 --> 00:21:18.878 position:16% line:83% align:start
-[whimpers] No, it's not.
-[KAGURA giggles]

00:21:19.013 --> 00:21:21.549 position:24% line:83% align:start
You've gotten a lot
pervier yourself, you know.

00:21:21.681 --> 00:21:23.384 position:21% line:89% align:start
What? No, I haven't!

00:21:24.185 --> 00:21:26.987 position:33% line:83% align:start
And we know,
Yuzuki's a closet perv.

00:21:27.288 --> 00:21:28.289 position:38% line:89% align:start
[sneezes]

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:29.924 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm?

00:21:31.791 --> 00:21:34.361 position:16% line:89% align:start
My, my! How interesting.

00:21:34.861 --> 00:21:36.597 position:30% line:83% align:start
It appears that
Akagami's affected

00:21:36.729 --> 00:21:38.299 position:16% line:89% align:start
each and every one of us.

00:21:38.499 --> 00:21:40.568 position:24% line:83% align:start
After all, remember
how the four of us

00:21:40.700 --> 00:21:42.203 position:24% line:83% align:start
used to sit around
trying to come up

00:21:42.336 --> 00:21:44.438 position:19% line:83% align:start
with ways to drive him
out of the temple?

00:21:44.572 --> 00:21:46.507 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'd almost forgotten.

00:21:46.706 --> 00:21:48.642 position:7% line:89% align:start
I guess that Akagami's arrival

00:21:48.775 --> 00:21:51.312 position:7% line:83% align:start
was the biggest change of all,
huh?

00:21:51.512 --> 00:21:52.947 position:19% line:89% align:start
You have a point there.

00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:55.416 position:24% line:83% align:start
Now none of us want
to get rid of him, do we?

00:21:55.549 --> 00:21:57.717 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:21:58.552 --> 00:22:00.221 position:35% line:89% align:start
[chuckles]

00:22:05.259 --> 00:22:07.860 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Such a fascinating individual,

00:22:07.995 --> 00:22:09.396 position:33% line:89% align:start
that Akagami.

00:22:13.434 --> 00:22:16.203 position:38% line:83% align:start
I suppose
there's no getting around it.

00:22:16.637 --> 00:22:18.906 position:16% line:89% align:start
I'll have to take action.

00:23:53.233 --> 00:23:54.568 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tell me.

00:23:54.702 --> 00:23:57.905 position:13% line:83% align:start
What can be found dangling
around the middle of the body?

00:23:58.038 --> 00:24:00.574 position:19% line:83% align:start
Using them by yourself
can be a sign of growth.

00:24:00.708 --> 00:24:01.909 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hey, Mia!

00:24:02.042 --> 00:24:03.444 position:27% line:83% align:start
They tend to vary
somewhat in thickness.

00:24:03.577 --> 00:24:04.611 position:16% line:89% align:start
The round parts are key!

00:24:04.745 --> 00:24:07.381 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]
