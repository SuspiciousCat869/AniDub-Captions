There are many steps
on the path to priesthood.

00:00:10.745 --> 00:00:12.312 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
To enter the training ground,

00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:14.782 position:30% line:83% align:start
one must first
undergo "tokudo."

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:16.551 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's a lot to it.

00:00:16.684 --> 00:00:19.386 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like reading sutras
and assorted other texts,

00:00:19.521 --> 00:00:21.623 position:30% line:83% align:start
and performing
all kinds of rituals.

00:00:21.756 --> 00:00:24.926 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Basically, it's how
one would become a priest.

00:00:25.527 --> 00:00:28.495 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki hasn't undergone
tokudo yet, either.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.330 position:21% line:83% align:start
-[MIA, AKAGAMI] Huh?!
-Are you surprised?

00:00:30.464 --> 00:00:32.867 position:30% line:83% align:start
You and she are
effectively at the same level.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.805 position:7% line:83% align:start
You see, students usually spend
a year training for tokudo.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.374 position:16% line:83% align:start
She's trying to do it in
half that time,

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:42.610 position:21% line:83% align:start
while simultaneously
attending school.

00:00:42.744 --> 00:00:46.380 position:21% line:83% align:start
To become head priest
just as quickly as possible.

00:00:46.714 --> 00:00:50.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
She'll need to finish
within three months' time.

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.687 position:16% line:89% align:start
Too much of a challenge?

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.390 position:16% line:83% align:start
If that's the case, then
the engagement is off.

00:00:57.257 --> 00:00:59.627 position:24% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] We've got a
tokudo problem, Yuzuki.

00:01:00.427 --> 00:01:01.863 position:33% line:83% align:start
The ceremony
is supposed to be held

00:01:01.996 --> 00:01:03.731 position:33% line:83% align:start
at the temple
where the candidate trained.

00:01:03.865 --> 00:01:06.568 position:41% line:83% align:start
Namely,
the main hall of this temple.

00:01:06.868 --> 00:01:07.936 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yeah?

00:01:08.435 --> 00:01:11.405 position:10% line:83% align:start
Key sect members will attend
the ceremony as well.

00:01:11.773 --> 00:01:13.473 position:16% line:89% align:start
But before that happens,

00:01:13.608 --> 00:01:16.343 position:35% line:83% align:start
the temple
is subject to an inspection.

00:01:20.682 --> 00:01:21.716 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:01:23.283 --> 00:01:25.319 position:27% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] We can't
afford to repair the statue!

00:01:25.452 --> 00:01:27.555 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
No way!

00:01:31.358 --> 00:01:33.061 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
There's no way around it.

00:01:33.193 --> 00:01:35.029 position:21% line:83% align:start
The principal figure
must be repaired

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.297 position:27% line:83% align:start
if we're to host
a tokudo ceremony.

00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:39.299 position:24% line:89% align:start
At the very least,

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:41.401 position:16% line:83% align:start
something will have to be
done about its broken neck.

00:01:41.536 --> 00:01:44.706 position:13% line:83% align:start
I've started asking around
to get an idea of the expense,

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:46.941 position:19% line:89% align:start
and at the very least,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:49.677 position:19% line:89% align:start
it'll cost 500,000 yen.

00:01:50.712 --> 00:01:54.181 position:19% line:83% align:start
Wow. That's definitely
more than I was expecting.

00:01:54.314 --> 00:01:55.883 position:13% line:89% align:start
I should have acted sooner.

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:57.451 position:35% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry.

00:01:58.019 --> 00:01:59.520 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Don't worry.

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.857 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'll figure something out.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.462 position:30% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki. How are
you this confident?

00:02:08.663 --> 00:02:10.230 position:27% line:83% align:start
I have a feeling
things will be fine,

00:02:10.364 --> 00:02:11.633 position:19% line:89% align:start
so I'm sure it's true.

00:02:11.766 --> 00:02:13.635 position:24% line:83% align:start
There's optimistic,
and then there's stupid!

00:02:13.768 --> 00:02:15.970 position:19% line:83% align:start
Have you been listening
to a single word I've said?

00:02:16.104 --> 00:02:17.270 position:16% line:89% align:start
Just think for a minute!

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:20.173 position:16% line:83% align:start
How are we gonna come up
with 500,000 yen?

00:02:20.307 --> 00:02:22.944 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're flat broke,
badly short-staffed.

00:02:23.143 --> 00:02:26.413 position:10% line:83% align:start
Can't even afford the upkeep
on our principal figure.

00:02:27.615 --> 00:02:29.884 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hoan was well
aware of these things,

00:02:30.118 --> 00:02:31.119 position:27% line:89% align:start
and nonetheless,

00:02:31.284 --> 00:02:32.854 position:27% line:83% align:start
he insisted that
I undergo tokudo

00:02:32.987 --> 00:02:34.154 position:21% line:89% align:start
within three months.

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:37.091 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I should fail to
achieve this much,

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:38.559 position:30% line:83% align:start
then what hope
do we have of ever

00:02:38.693 --> 00:02:40.895 position:35% line:83% align:start
turning our
circumstances around?

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.630 position:19% line:89% align:start
So again, don't worry.

00:02:42.764 --> 00:02:43.831 position:30% line:89% align:start
Leave it to me.

00:02:43.965 --> 00:02:46.067 position:24% line:89% align:start
Because, after all,

00:02:46.701 --> 00:02:49.737 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm the one who's going to
take over Mikazuki Temple!

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:25.099 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
I can't.

00:04:25.233 --> 00:04:28.468 position:10% line:83% align:start
I won't allow Yuzuki to bear
the entirety of this burden.

00:04:36.644 --> 00:04:39.080 position:10% line:89% align:start
My contact information, huh?

00:04:39.547 --> 00:04:41.448 position:16% line:83% align:start
I want to keep this quiet
from the others,

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.185 position:16% line:83% align:start
so I'd better not use the
temple's phone number.

00:04:45.153 --> 00:04:47.822 position:21% line:83% align:start
But I don't currently
have a phone of my own.

00:04:48.488 --> 00:04:50.091 position:35% line:89% align:start
[grunting]

00:04:50.591 --> 00:04:52.960 position:35% line:83% align:start
Well, then.
I'll have to borrow one.

00:04:54.327 --> 00:04:55.295 position:35% line:89% align:start
[knocking]

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.732 position:10% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki? Do you have a moment?

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:00.433 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Huh? Akagami?

00:05:01.602 --> 00:05:03.638 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hold on, okay?
-Okay.

00:05:09.409 --> 00:05:10.978 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry about that.

00:05:17.618 --> 00:05:19.620 position:13% line:83% align:start
Is there something I can do
for you?

00:05:20.188 --> 00:05:22.455 position:24% line:83% align:start
Oh wait, let's not
talk out in the hall.

00:05:22.723 --> 00:05:24.525 position:19% line:89% align:start
Why don't you come in?

00:05:26.426 --> 00:05:27.929 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, then.

00:05:29.163 --> 00:05:30.631 position:24% line:89% align:start
How can I help you?

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:31.899 position:38% line:89% align:start
[giggles]

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.001 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
So, like,

00:05:34.135 --> 00:05:36.637 position:27% line:83% align:start
am I supposed to
pretend I don't notice?

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:40.074 position:27% line:83% align:start
She is wearing a
maid uniform, right?

00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:43.110 position:19% line:83% align:start
Why is she acting like
that's perfectly normal?

00:05:43.778 --> 00:05:45.980 position:19% line:83% align:start
-Is something bothering
you, Akagami? -No!

00:05:46.113 --> 00:05:47.447 position:27% line:89% align:start
Not in the least!

00:05:50.284 --> 00:05:51.752 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Settle down.

00:05:51.886 --> 00:05:53.353 position:13% line:83% align:start
The only reason you're here
is to borrow a phone.

00:05:53.486 --> 00:05:54.722 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's no big deal.

00:05:54.856 --> 00:05:57.925 position:38% line:83% align:start
Actually,
I have...a favor to ask you.

00:05:58.226 --> 00:06:00.127 position:27% line:89% align:start
Hm? Oh, a favor.

00:06:00.628 --> 00:06:02.530 position:33% line:83% align:start
Please don't
hold back, Master.

00:06:02.663 --> 00:06:04.966 position:24% line:83% align:start
Tell me what I can
do to curry your favor,

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.668 position:13% line:83% align:start
-and it will be my pleasure
to comply. -Again...

00:06:07.802 --> 00:06:08.736 position:41% line:89% align:start
F-f...

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:09.737 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, then,

00:06:09.871 --> 00:06:11.438 position:38% line:83% align:start
how can I
be of service to you?

00:06:11.572 --> 00:06:12.807 position:35% line:89% align:start
F-f-f-f...

00:06:14.407 --> 00:06:16.310 position:7% line:89% align:start
May I please borrow your phone?

00:06:16.577 --> 00:06:18.112 position:35% line:89% align:start
No problem.

00:06:18.546 --> 00:06:19.814 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
My brain's showing me

00:06:19.947 --> 00:06:21.381 position:24% line:83% align:start
the most suggestive
maid poses possible!

00:06:21.515 --> 00:06:23.317 position:27% line:89% align:start
I can't take it!

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:25.586 position:10% line:89% align:start
My phone, huh? Just a second.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.923 position:38% line:83% align:start

Let's see. Where'd I put it?

00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:29.957 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:06:33.127 --> 00:06:34.095 position:41% line:89% align:start
There!

00:06:34.228 --> 00:06:35.897 position:10% line:89% align:start
Guess it fell behind the bed.

Almost...

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.135 position:21% line:89% align:start
Here you go, Akagami!

00:06:41.769 --> 00:06:43.271 position:13% line:89% align:start
What's with all the blood?

00:06:43.604 --> 00:06:45.806 position:7% line:89% align:start
You okay? You're acting weird!

Like you've got room to talk!

00:06:49.777 --> 00:06:51.112 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Anyway.

00:06:51.245 --> 00:06:52.546 position:24% line:89% align:start
Why do you need it?

00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.583 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's actually your
phone number I need.

00:06:56.017 --> 00:06:57.685 position:33% line:83% align:start
Turns out you
have to provide one

00:06:57.818 --> 00:06:59.754 position:38% line:83% align:start
whenever
you apply for a job.

00:06:59.887 --> 00:07:00.721 position:41% line:89% align:start

touch-and-go there,

but I managed
to get through it.

00:07:05.159 --> 00:07:07.828 position:35% line:89% align:start
Hm? Yuzuki?

00:07:07.962 --> 00:07:08.996 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hm...

00:07:10.097 --> 00:07:11.165 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right!

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.601 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Akagami.

00:07:13.734 --> 00:07:15.803 position:30% line:83% align:start
So what kind of
clothes are you wearing?

00:07:16.537 --> 00:07:17.905 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
She's asking me?!

00:07:18.039 --> 00:07:20.274 position:10% line:83% align:start
Is she fishing for a comment
on the maid getup?

00:07:20.473 --> 00:07:23.778 position:10% line:83% align:start
Forget it. I'm going to give
a straightforward answer.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:26.213 position:19% line:89% align:start
They're a monk's robes.

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:31.852 position:33% line:89% align:start
Aren't they?

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.524 position:24% line:89% align:start
Mm. Yes, of course.

00:07:37.792 --> 00:07:40.094 position:19% line:83% align:start
And you're wearing them
because you're in training,

00:07:40.294 --> 00:07:42.330 position:19% line:83% align:start
which is what you need
to be focusing on

00:07:42.462 --> 00:07:45.333 position:7% line:83% align:start
as opposed to looking for other
work outside of the temple.

00:07:45.465 --> 00:07:48.336 position:21% line:83% align:start
Listen, those repairs
are going to be costly.

00:07:48.468 --> 00:07:49.870 position:21% line:89% align:start
I just want to help.

00:07:50.004 --> 00:07:51.906 position:24% line:83% align:start
I'm getting a job,
so don't worry about it.

00:07:52.039 --> 00:07:54.275 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're in training
the same as I am.

And 500,000 yen
is an awful lot of money

00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:59.580 position:16% line:83% align:start
for a high school student
working part time!

00:07:59.714 --> 00:08:01.082 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
It'll be fine.

00:08:02.016 --> 00:08:03.851 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll get five jobs or even six!

00:08:03.985 --> 00:08:05.553 position:27% line:83% align:start
In what universe
is that anything

00:08:05.686 --> 00:08:06.887 position:13% line:89% align:start
remotely resembling "fine?"

00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:08.856 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'll see. It'll all work out.

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.292 position:24% line:83% align:start
At least be willing
to accept a little help!

00:08:11.425 --> 00:08:12.727 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akagami.

00:08:13.227 --> 00:08:15.663 position:21% line:83% align:start
I selected this path
all by myself.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:20.034 position:7% line:83% align:start
Letting my battles be fought by
others, would be wrong.

00:08:20.234 --> 00:08:21.635 position:38% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki...

00:08:22.303 --> 00:08:23.871 position:19% line:89% align:start
I'll handle this alone.

00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:26.173 position:7% line:89% align:start
Just like my mother would have.

00:08:27.708 --> 00:08:29.810 position:30% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] She's
trying to be like Tsukina,

00:08:29.944 --> 00:08:32.213 position:27% line:83% align:start
the woman Tendou
was telling me about.

00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:35.916 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Please, Akagami. Believe me.

00:08:37.318 --> 00:08:40.121 position:16% line:83% align:start
I know I'll figure out a
way to get through this!

00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:42.189 position:16% line:89% align:start
Yeah? Like what, exactly?

00:08:42.323 --> 00:08:43.858 position:30% line:89% align:start
Well, I, uh...

00:08:44.358 --> 00:08:45.893 position:10% line:89% align:start
I'll only work double shifts.

00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:47.928 position:21% line:83% align:start
Can you hear yourself
right now?

00:08:48.062 --> 00:08:50.097 position:27% line:83% align:start
Because you sound
pretty dopey!

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:51.399 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?!

00:08:51.532 --> 00:08:53.567 position:19% line:83% align:start
I have a highly unusual
amount of work experience

00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:55.102 position:19% line:89% align:start
so let me handle this!

00:08:55.469 --> 00:08:58.406 position:10% line:83% align:start
You expect me to be convinced
when you won't even face me?

00:08:58.539 --> 00:08:59.840 position:35% line:89% align:start
Seriously?

00:08:59.974 --> 00:09:02.076 position:24% line:83% align:start
Sorry! I just can't
look at you right now!

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.645 position:16% line:83% align:start
Can't stand the sight of
me 'cause I'm so stupid?

00:09:04.779 --> 00:09:06.647 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's not what I
was trying to say at all!

00:09:06.781 --> 00:09:08.682 position:24% line:83% align:start
Then you're unable
to look me in the eye

00:09:08.816 --> 00:09:11.218 position:24% line:83% align:start
because you realize
I'm right about this!

00:09:11.685 --> 00:09:13.421 position:10% line:89% align:start
I humbly accept your apology.

00:09:13.554 --> 00:09:15.022 position:21% line:89% align:start
That's not it either.

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:17.558 position:13% line:83% align:start
I can't look at you because
of what you're wearing!

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.061 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:09:21.595 --> 00:09:22.997 position:47% line:89% align:start
Ah!

00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:24.999 position:24% line:83% align:start
No way! Have I been
wearing this the whole time?

00:09:25.132 --> 00:09:27.068 position:24% line:83% align:start
I couldn't imagine
a cuter, sexier outfit

00:09:27.201 --> 00:09:29.236 position:16% line:83% align:start
than that one if I tried,
and believe me, I have!

00:09:29.370 --> 00:09:30.938 position:21% line:83% align:start
It doesn't help that
you're very charming

00:09:31.072 --> 00:09:32.373 position:24% line:83% align:start
and have extremely
beautiful eyes!

00:09:32.507 --> 00:09:33.874 position:10% line:89% align:start
Will you shut up, you idiot?

00:09:34.008 --> 00:09:35.544 position:30% line:83% align:start
I'm embarrassed
enough as it is!

00:09:35.676 --> 00:09:36.944 position:19% line:89% align:start
Listen, I can explain!

00:09:37.078 --> 00:09:38.612 position:24% line:83% align:start
The desire to have
you serve me as a maid

00:09:38.746 --> 00:09:40.214 position:10% line:89% align:start
was more than I could handle!

00:09:40.347 --> 00:09:42.083 position:19% line:89% align:start
I beg you, hear me out!

00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:44.285 position:35% line:89% align:start
I see now.

00:09:44.418 --> 00:09:46.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
What you're wearing
right now is, in fact,

00:09:46.153 --> 00:09:47.955 position:13% line:89% align:start
your friend's work uniform.

00:09:48.089 --> 00:09:49.223 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-mm.

00:09:49.457 --> 00:09:51.092 position:24% line:83% align:start
When she offered to
get you a job where she works,

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:53.461 position:27% line:83% align:start
you borrowed it,
so you could try it on

00:09:54.695 --> 00:09:56.964 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] Then you happened
to fall asleep wearing it,

00:09:57.098 --> 00:09:58.732 position:10% line:89% align:start
and that's when I showed up?

00:09:58.866 --> 00:10:00.502 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[knocking]
-[gasps]

00:10:00.701 --> 00:10:02.136 position:21% line:89% align:start
I must've nodded off.

00:10:02.269 --> 00:10:03.671 position:24% line:83% align:start
I've been pounding
the pavement

00:10:03.804 --> 00:10:05.507 position:27% line:83% align:start
looking for work,
and I'm totally beat.

00:10:05.639 --> 00:10:06.740 position:24% line:89% align:start
Pretty funny. Huh?

00:10:06.874 --> 00:10:08.409 position:7% line:89% align:start
This is what I'm talking about.

00:10:08.543 --> 00:10:10.311 position:16% line:89% align:start
You're exhausted already!

00:10:10.444 --> 00:10:12.446 position:7% line:89% align:start
Uh. No, I must have misspoken!

00:10:12.613 --> 00:10:15.182 position:13% line:83% align:start
So you're still determined
to fight me on this, are you?

00:10:15.316 --> 00:10:16.884 position:30% line:83% align:start
-I'm not tired!
-Yes, you are!

00:10:17.017 --> 00:10:19.153 position:30% line:83% align:start
and the outfit
you're wearing proves it!

00:10:22.256 --> 00:10:24.358 position:27% line:89% align:start
Fine! Wanna bet?

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:27.761 position:10% line:83% align:start
You test me to see how tired
or not I really am.

00:10:28.062 --> 00:10:30.397 position:21% line:83% align:start
All you have to do is
make me fall asleep.

00:10:30.599 --> 00:10:32.166 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do that, and you win.

00:10:32.366 --> 00:10:33.834 position:21% line:89% align:start
Make you fall asleep?

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:35.302 position:30% line:89% align:start
Okay, but how?

00:10:35.537 --> 00:10:38.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
I dunno. Try giving me
a massage or something!

00:10:38.472 --> 00:10:40.241 position:24% line:89% align:start
Me, service a maid?

00:10:40.674 --> 00:10:42.643 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Go on.
-[AKAGAMI] For real?

00:10:42.776 --> 00:10:44.078 position:13% line:89% align:start
No way. This is impossible!

00:10:44.211 --> 00:10:45.880 position:10% line:89% align:start
Just looking drives me crazy.

00:10:46.013 --> 00:10:48.149 position:30% line:83% align:start
Actual touching
is out of the question!

00:10:48.517 --> 00:10:50.351 position:10% line:89% align:start
Is there a problem, Akagami?

00:10:50.585 --> 00:10:52.621 position:41% line:83% align:start
[gasps]
Uh. No...

00:10:52.753 --> 00:10:54.021 position:41% line:89% align:start
Mm-hm?

00:10:54.388 --> 00:10:55.789 position:16% line:89% align:start
Are you admitting defeat?

00:10:55.923 --> 00:10:58.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
Well then, I'm afraid
I can't lend you my phone.

00:10:59.693 --> 00:11:01.563 position:19% line:89% align:start
All right. Here we go.

00:11:01.762 --> 00:11:02.997 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:11:03.464 --> 00:11:04.498 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm.

00:11:04.665 --> 00:11:06.400 position:38% line:83% align:start
So you've
found your motivation.

00:11:06.535 --> 00:11:09.003 position:24% line:83% align:start
Still, my training
toughened me enough to--

00:11:09.436 --> 00:11:10.671 position:38% line:89% align:start
[squeals]

00:11:11.872 --> 00:11:14.375 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
What's going on here?

00:11:14.509 --> 00:11:15.876 position:27% line:89% align:start
This isn't fair.

00:11:16.177 --> 00:11:17.811 position:10% line:89% align:start
Why are you so good at this?

00:11:18.279 --> 00:11:21.081 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
This feeling. This reaction.

00:11:22.917 --> 00:11:24.218 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yes! Right there!

00:11:24.351 --> 00:11:26.621 position:16% line:83% align:start
She really is exhausted,
isn't she?

00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:28.455 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm sorry, Yuzuki,

00:11:28.590 --> 00:11:30.191 position:16% line:89% align:start
but the body doesn't lie.

00:11:30.424 --> 00:11:32.960 position:19% line:83% align:start
I'll begin by promoting
the flow of lymphatic fluid

00:11:33.093 --> 00:11:35.796 position:16% line:83% align:start
from the back of her neck
to her shoulder blades.

00:11:37.932 --> 00:11:39.400 position:44% line:83% align:start
Next,
I'll stretch her lower body

00:11:39.534 --> 00:11:43.070 position:13% line:83% align:start
and improve her circulation
from top...to...bottom!

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:46.707 position:16% line:83% align:start
[EROMITSU] Her side-boobs
are totally exposed.

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.709 position:24% line:83% align:start
It's not your fault
if your hands slip.

00:11:48.842 --> 00:11:50.377 position:35% line:83% align:start
[BAKAGAMI]
Don't you dare neglect

00:11:50.512 --> 00:11:51.646 position:16% line:89% align:start
the thighs and rear end.

00:11:51.779 --> 00:11:53.480 position:27% line:83% align:start
It's so important
that you loosen up

00:11:53.615 --> 00:11:55.316 position:19% line:89% align:start
her entire body evenly.

00:11:55.684 --> 00:11:59.353 position:21% line:83% align:start
[EROMITSU, BAKAGAMI]
Do it! Do it! Do it! Do it!

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.155 position:35% line:89% align:start
Akagami...

00:12:01.288 --> 00:12:03.157 position:21% line:83% align:start
[EROMITSU, BAKAGAMI]
Do it! Do it!

00:12:03.424 --> 00:12:05.292 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:12:06.894 --> 00:12:10.064 position:33% line:83% align:start
I must hurry,
before I lose all reason!

00:12:12.032 --> 00:12:15.803 position:7% line:89% align:start
[AKAGAMI AND YUZUKI screaming]

00:12:16.003 --> 00:12:18.038 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
Akagami, wait!

00:12:18.372 --> 00:12:20.107 position:33% line:89% align:start
[chattering]

00:12:21.475 --> 00:12:23.010 position:35% line:83% align:start
[squealing]
No!

00:12:24.178 --> 00:12:27.081 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Huh. Don't care for that.

00:12:27.915 --> 00:12:30.451 position:7% line:89% align:start
Akagami! Now you've finally...

00:12:30.585 --> 00:12:31.819 position:35% line:89% align:start
[cracking]

00:12:32.554 --> 00:12:34.088 position:38% line:89% align:start
So good!

00:12:34.623 --> 00:12:36.658 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've taken up wrestling?

00:12:36.790 --> 00:12:37.825 position:38% line:89% align:start
[panting]

00:12:38.225 --> 00:12:40.629 position:35% line:83% align:start
Hey, Yuzu.
What's with that maid outfit?

00:12:41.362 --> 00:12:44.031 position:27% line:83% align:start
I promise there's
an explanation, Tsukuyo.

00:12:44.532 --> 00:12:45.899 position:38% line:89% align:start
I did it.

00:12:46.166 --> 00:12:48.068 position:19% line:89% align:start
You see? I'm not tired.

00:12:49.103 --> 00:12:50.771 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[drowsing]
-Huh?!

00:12:51.071 --> 00:12:53.040 position:13% line:89% align:start
You see? I'm not tired at--

00:12:54.241 --> 00:12:56.010 position:13% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki, give it up already.

00:12:56.277 --> 00:12:59.213 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm telling you, I'll take
care of this on my own!

00:12:59.346 --> 00:13:01.549 position:30% line:83% align:start
Why do you have
to be so stubborn?

00:13:01.849 --> 00:13:03.284 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well. Because...

00:13:03.518 --> 00:13:04.653 position:35% line:89% align:start
Never mind!

00:13:05.319 --> 00:13:07.888 position:30% line:83% align:start
All of this has
nothing to do with you!

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:14.862 position:41% line:89% align:start
I see.

00:13:16.564 --> 00:13:17.732 position:35% line:83% align:start
-Akagami--
-Fine!

00:13:17.865 --> 00:13:18.966 position:24% line:83% align:start
If it's got nothing
to do with me,

00:13:19.099 --> 00:13:20.735 position:27% line:83% align:start
I guess I'm free
to do what I want.

00:13:20.868 --> 00:13:22.303 position:30% line:83% align:start
-Hey, Tsukuyo!
-Uh-huh?

00:13:22.436 --> 00:13:25.039 position:19% line:83% align:start
I was wondering, would
you like to go out with me?

Great! Let's plan on tomorrow.

00:13:29.243 --> 00:13:31.546 position:24% line:89% align:start
Go out? You mean...

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:41.455 position:30% line:89% align:start
[bell tolling]

00:13:42.956 --> 00:13:45.392 position:13% line:89% align:start
Hey, Tsukuyo. Would you...

00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:47.762 position:19% line:89% align:start
please go out with me?

00:13:47.895 --> 00:13:49.029 position:38% line:89% align:start
Say what?

00:13:49.830 --> 00:13:52.333 position:10% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI] And while we're at
it, will you marry me?

00:13:53.067 --> 00:13:55.369 position:27% line:83% align:start
We'll consummate
things at once.

00:13:55.969 --> 00:13:57.971 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Consummate?
-And then have kids.

00:13:58.105 --> 00:13:59.774 position:33% line:89% align:start
So many kids!

00:13:59.907 --> 00:14:02.544 position:38% line:89% align:start
Wait. No!

00:14:03.844 --> 00:14:06.548 position:35% line:89% align:start
[screaming]

00:14:07.114 --> 00:14:08.315 position:30% line:89% align:start
What'll it be?

00:14:08.482 --> 00:14:10.851 position:7% line:89% align:start
Three trips to a sweets buffet.

00:14:11.318 --> 00:14:13.887 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Can we make it two?
-No deal.

00:14:15.089 --> 00:14:16.457 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Fine.

00:14:17.458 --> 00:14:18.992 position:27% line:89% align:start
[water trickling]

00:14:22.029 --> 00:14:23.864 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
I suppose I'm still processing

00:14:23.997 --> 00:14:25.600 position:10% line:89% align:start
what Akagami said yesterday.

00:14:25.734 --> 00:14:28.603 position:7% line:83% align:start
I was wondering, would you like
to go out with me?

00:14:28.737 --> 00:14:30.037 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:14:30.270 --> 00:14:32.674 position:21% line:83% align:start
I still can't believe
he asked me out on a date.

00:14:32.841 --> 00:14:35.610 position:24% line:83% align:start
When did he develop
those kinds of feelings for me?

00:14:37.444 --> 00:14:38.546 position:38% line:89% align:start
Or, wait.

00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:41.215 position:13% line:83% align:start
Could I be misunderstanding
things again?

00:14:41.816 --> 00:14:44.118 position:21% line:89% align:start
Ugh. I am, aren't I?

00:14:44.451 --> 00:14:46.521 position:41% line:83% align:start
[sighs]
Definitely.

00:14:47.955 --> 00:14:50.190 position:27% line:83% align:start
Well, I won't be
fooled this time.

00:14:50.424 --> 00:14:51.559 position:41% line:89% align:start
Right.

00:14:51.693 --> 00:14:54.361 position:13% line:83% align:start
Let's keep it casual today.
Nice and light.

âª

00:15:13.213 --> 00:15:14.381 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
This is fine!

00:15:14.516 --> 00:15:16.684 position:27% line:83% align:start
You didn't do any
of this for Akagami.

00:15:16.818 --> 00:15:20.220 position:10% line:83% align:start
You're just excited to go out
and have fun on your day off.

00:15:20.354 --> 00:15:21.955 position:21% line:83% align:start
Wouldn't want anyone
thinking you don't

00:15:22.089 --> 00:15:23.892 position:13% line:89% align:start
care about your appearance.

00:15:24.057 --> 00:15:25.926 position:21% line:89% align:start
Sorry about the wait.

00:15:27.294 --> 00:15:28.797 position:16% line:89% align:start
Thanks for your patience.

00:15:28.929 --> 00:15:32.099 position:13% line:83% align:start
Training ran a little long
this morning and held me up.

00:15:33.033 --> 00:15:34.268 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:15:34.935 --> 00:15:36.871 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Exactly as I suspected!

00:15:37.037 --> 00:15:39.006 position:10% line:89% align:start
He looks the same as always.

00:15:39.139 --> 00:15:41.308 position:27% line:83% align:start
This doesn't feel
date-like at all.

00:15:44.612 --> 00:15:45.412 position:35% line:89% align:start
It's true.

00:15:45.547 --> 00:15:47.849 position:7% line:89% align:start
I misunderstood his intentions.

00:15:48.115 --> 00:15:50.518 position:27% line:89% align:start
Well, I must say,

00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:53.521 position:10% line:83% align:start
you're looking even prettier
than usual, Tsukuyo.

00:15:54.421 --> 00:15:56.691 position:27% line:83% align:start
Going out with as
beautiful a woman as you,

00:15:56.925 --> 00:15:59.059 position:10% line:89% align:start
it makes me kind of nervous.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.666 position:19% line:83% align:start
Ha! Exactly when did I
agree to go out with you?

00:16:04.799 --> 00:16:07.602 position:19% line:83% align:start
Oh. Did I misunderstand
you yesterday?

00:16:07.936 --> 00:16:08.937 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Wait a second.

00:16:09.069 --> 00:16:10.270 position:16% line:89% align:start
Don't fly off the handle.

00:16:10.738 --> 00:16:12.640 position:21% line:83% align:start
There's no confusion,
all right?

00:16:12.841 --> 00:16:13.775 position:19% line:89% align:start
Let's get out of here.

00:16:13.908 --> 00:16:16.544 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Okay, sounds good.

00:16:17.277 --> 00:16:19.213 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
So...where are we going?

00:16:19.346 --> 00:16:21.014 position:19% line:89% align:start
Over to the phone shop.

00:16:21.148 --> 00:16:22.584 position:27% line:83% align:start
But I'm not sure
how to get there,

00:16:22.717 --> 00:16:24.519 position:24% line:83% align:start
so I was hoping you
could lead the way.

00:16:24.686 --> 00:16:27.622 position:21% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Right. You
lost your phone, didn't you?

00:16:27.856 --> 00:16:28.923 position:27% line:89% align:start
And is that all?

00:16:29.056 --> 00:16:30.390 position:27% line:89% align:start
Yeah, I think so.

00:16:30.725 --> 00:16:32.827 position:16% line:83% align:start
Unless there's somewhere
you'd like to go.

00:16:32.961 --> 00:16:34.662 position:19% line:89% align:start
Nowhere I can think of?

00:16:34.796 --> 00:16:36.296 position:35% line:89% align:start
Not really.

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.867 position:16% line:83% align:start
I only came along because
I had nothing else to do today.

00:16:39.466 --> 00:16:40.902 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
That's settled then.

00:16:41.034 --> 00:16:42.169 position:38% line:89% align:start
I get it.

00:16:42.302 --> 00:16:44.104 position:24% line:83% align:start
He brought me along
to be his guide.

00:16:44.371 --> 00:16:46.574 position:7% line:83% align:start
Got any idea what kind of phone
you might want?

00:16:46.708 --> 00:16:48.075 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes.

00:16:48.208 --> 00:16:50.712 position:10% line:83% align:start
My main objective is to spend
as little money as possible.

00:16:50.845 --> 00:16:51.846 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:16:52.412 --> 00:16:54.616 position:27% line:83% align:start
This plan seemed
like a good fit.

00:16:57.886 --> 00:17:00.622 position:27% line:89% align:start
For couples, huh?

00:17:00.889 --> 00:17:04.057 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yep! After all, we are
living together, aren't we?

00:17:04.458 --> 00:17:06.426 position:16% line:89% align:start
We do share a roof, yes!

00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:10.632 position:24% line:89% align:start
I'm terribly sorry,

00:17:10.765 --> 00:17:12.967 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you can't sign up
for that plan with a minor.

00:17:13.100 --> 00:17:14.234 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, is that right?

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:15.770 position:19% line:89% align:start
Yeah, that makes sense.

00:17:15.904 --> 00:17:17.906 position:21% line:83% align:start
If you're interested,
we could always set you up

00:17:18.038 --> 00:17:19.641 position:19% line:89% align:start
with this plan instead.

00:17:20.040 --> 00:17:21.308 position:30% line:83% align:start
It'll give you
plenty of minutes

00:17:21.441 --> 00:17:23.243 position:24% line:83% align:start
to talk to the ones
you love.

00:17:23.778 --> 00:17:25.045 position:44% line:89% align:start
Hmm.

00:17:25.178 --> 00:17:26.915 position:24% line:83% align:start
Looks like the base
cost is pretty low.

00:17:27.214 --> 00:17:28.382 position:24% line:89% align:start
Sure. I'll take it.

00:17:28.516 --> 00:17:30.284 position:7% line:89% align:start
I'll pay using points, please.

00:17:30.417 --> 00:17:32.286 position:13% line:89% align:start
I'm happy I could help you

00:17:35.790 --> 00:17:37.725 position:24% line:83% align:start
Give me one moment
if you would.

00:17:41.596 --> 00:17:44.197 position:30% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Man,
this is the absolute worst.

00:17:44.331 --> 00:17:46.768 position:19% line:83% align:start
That clerk totally got
the wrong idea about us.

00:17:46.968 --> 00:17:49.704 position:24% line:83% align:start
Is he doing this on
purpose to torture me?

00:17:52.874 --> 00:17:54.776 position:19% line:89% align:start
Enough. I'm going home.

00:17:55.009 --> 00:17:56.376 position:33% line:89% align:start
Here you go.

00:17:57.177 --> 00:17:58.780 position:16% line:89% align:start
That's. Thanks for today.

00:17:59.313 --> 00:18:01.248 position:24% line:83% align:start
This is that drink
you like, isn't it?

00:18:02.016 --> 00:18:04.351 position:41% line:83% align:start
-Yeah.
-Oh! Did I get it wrong?

00:18:04.484 --> 00:18:06.821 position:41% line:83% align:start
Nuh-uh.
No. You got it right.

00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:08.690 position:33% line:89% align:start
I thought so.

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:13.393 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
How about that?

00:18:14.127 --> 00:18:15.395 position:24% line:89% align:start
He may be a dummy,

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:17.599 position:19% line:89% align:start
but he pays attention.

00:18:20.167 --> 00:18:21.435 position:44% line:89% align:start
Good.

00:18:21.603 --> 00:18:22.770 position:35% line:89% align:start
Now, then.

00:18:23.504 --> 00:18:24.672 position:19% line:89% align:start
It's getting late, huh?

00:18:24.806 --> 00:18:25.873 position:33% line:89% align:start
Shall we go?

00:18:29.544 --> 00:18:31.244 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:18:32.046 --> 00:18:33.681 position:19% line:89% align:start
What's wrong, Tsukuyo?

00:18:34.082 --> 00:18:35.683 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
It's all my fault.

00:18:35.817 --> 00:18:39.419 position:13% line:83% align:start
I completely misunderstood
everything that happened

00:18:40.021 --> 00:18:42.189 position:10% line:89% align:start
from Akagami's "confession,"

00:18:42.322 --> 00:18:44.692 position:16% line:89% align:start
to this supposed "date."

00:18:45.425 --> 00:18:48.763 position:19% line:83% align:start
And this desire I have
to spend time with him?

00:18:49.196 --> 00:18:51.666 position:27% line:83% align:start
I suppose that's
a misunderstanding, too.

00:18:52.232 --> 00:18:53.935 position:33% line:89% align:start
Hey, Akagami?

00:18:54.068 --> 00:18:55.335 position:44% line:89% align:start
Yes?

00:18:55.937 --> 00:18:58.506 position:33% line:89% align:start
Um...well...

00:19:00.742 --> 00:19:01.676 position:38% line:89% align:start
Hold on.

00:19:01.809 --> 00:19:03.745 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
What do I think I'm doing?

00:19:04.012 --> 00:19:06.648 position:19% line:89% align:start
Can I really say that?

00:19:09.817 --> 00:19:10.885 position:44% line:89% align:start
I...

00:19:11.719 --> 00:19:13.121 position:44% line:89% align:start
I...

00:19:14.689 --> 00:19:17.091 position:27% line:83% align:start
I think we should
exchange contact info.

00:19:17.224 --> 00:19:18.593 position:35% line:89% align:start
Good idea!

00:19:21.696 --> 00:19:24.197 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Yeah. For today, at least,

00:19:24.331 --> 00:19:26.266 position:21% line:89% align:start
I'll settle for this.

00:19:28.435 --> 00:19:29.937 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Whoa!

00:19:30.303 --> 00:19:32.573 position:10% line:89% align:start
What's that "Whoa" all about?

00:19:32.940 --> 00:19:34.909 position:19% line:83% align:start
This is the first time
I've ever exchanged

00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:36.176 position:21% line:89% align:start
numbers with a woman!

00:19:36.309 --> 00:19:37.879 position:30% line:89% align:start
Huh? Seriously?

00:19:38.012 --> 00:19:39.346 position:24% line:89% align:start
Thanks to my name,

00:19:39.479 --> 00:19:41.649 position:21% line:83% align:start
women hear "Akagami"
and they run screaming.

00:19:41.783 --> 00:19:43.350 position:35% line:89% align:start
Ah, got it!

00:19:43.584 --> 00:19:46.253 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
So I'm his first woman, and I?

00:19:46.521 --> 00:19:47.755 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, give it a rest!

00:19:47.889 --> 00:19:50.223 position:27% line:83% align:start
There's no deeper
meaning to any of this.

00:19:50.357 --> 00:19:51.559 position:35% line:89% align:start
Lucky you!

00:19:51.693 --> 00:19:53.260 position:10% line:89% align:start
Living with all these girls,

00:19:53.393 --> 00:19:55.262 position:16% line:83% align:start
you'll get their numbers,
too, huh?

00:19:55.395 --> 00:19:57.397 position:27% line:89% align:start
Man, what a haul!

00:19:57.732 --> 00:20:00.101 position:16% line:83% align:start
I hadn't thought of that,
but I guess you're right.

00:20:00.601 --> 00:20:03.104 position:16% line:83% align:start
Isn't that the reason you
bought a phone to begin with?

00:20:03.236 --> 00:20:05.573 position:27% line:83% align:start
No, I-- Well, how
should I put this?

00:20:05.707 --> 00:20:09.544 position:16% line:83% align:start
I need to engage in a bit
of secret communication.

00:20:10.343 --> 00:20:11.713 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Secret?

00:20:19.286 --> 00:20:20.922 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
Are you asleep?

00:20:21.055 --> 00:20:22.255 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
I'm still up.

00:20:22.389 --> 00:20:23.891 position:24% line:89% align:start
Can I see you now?

00:20:24.192 --> 00:20:25.425 position:44% line:89% align:start
What?

00:20:25.626 --> 00:20:26.527 position:38% line:89% align:start
Tsukuyo,

00:20:26.694 --> 00:20:28.596 position:19% line:89% align:start
No, we can't, Akagami.

00:20:28.796 --> 00:20:30.464 position:30% line:83% align:start
We're going to
wake the others.

00:20:30.598 --> 00:20:32.867 position:30% line:83% align:start
Let's give them
something to talk about!

00:20:33.768 --> 00:20:36.236 position:35% line:83% align:start
[squealing]
Consummation?

00:20:38.706 --> 00:20:40.675 position:35% line:83% align:start
[screaming]
Come on!

00:20:40.808 --> 00:20:43.044 position:27% line:83% align:start
That's definitely
a misunderstanding!

00:20:43.177 --> 00:20:45.079 position:19% line:89% align:start
Huh? Wow, is it really?

00:20:45.213 --> 00:20:46.714 position:30% line:89% align:start
Wait, what is?

00:20:51.152 --> 00:20:52.385 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm?

00:20:57.491 --> 00:20:58.926 position:38% line:83% align:start
[AKAGAMI]
You were a huge help today.

00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:01.261 position:16% line:83% align:start
I think I'm really going
to love this phone.

00:21:01.529 --> 00:21:03.898 position:19% line:83% align:start
I hope you'll continue
to help me in the future.

00:21:04.232 --> 00:21:05.533 position:24% line:89% align:start
Talk to you later.

00:21:08.870 --> 00:21:13.975 position:10% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO] Definitely for sure
a misunderstanding!

00:22:47.335 --> 00:22:49.170 position:38% line:89% align:start
[yawning]

00:22:49.604 --> 00:22:52.173 position:13% line:89% align:start
Oh, man, I really slept in.

00:22:53.007 --> 00:22:55.209 position:24% line:83% align:start
-Morning, Akagami.
-Great!

00:22:55.509 --> 00:22:57.511 position:16% line:89% align:start
Perfect timing, Tsukuyo.

00:22:59.313 --> 00:23:01.916 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's break up. That okay?

00:23:02.183 --> 00:23:03.684 position:44% line:89% align:start
Huh?

00:23:03.918 --> 00:23:06.654 position:7% line:83% align:start
To be quite honest, I found our
consummation rather boring.

00:23:07.054 --> 00:23:09.824 position:30% line:83% align:start
Consummation?!
But we're not even dating.

00:23:10.191 --> 00:23:13.060 position:21% line:83% align:start
Huh?! Wait a minute,
am I dreaming again?

00:23:13.194 --> 00:23:14.494 position:24% line:89% align:start
Farewell, Tsukuyo.

00:23:14.629 --> 00:23:16.597 position:33% line:83% align:start
From now on,
I'll be consummating

00:23:16.731 --> 00:23:17.965 position:19% line:89% align:start
with this girl instead.

00:23:18.099 --> 00:23:19.000 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:23:19.133 --> 00:23:20.167 position:35% line:89% align:start
[giggling]

00:23:20.568 --> 00:23:21.569 position:38% line:89% align:start
Akagami!

00:23:21.702 --> 00:23:23.037 position:27% line:89% align:start
Who is that girl?

00:23:23.170 --> 00:23:24.906 position:21% line:83% align:start
Also, what's the deal
with this background?

00:23:25.039 --> 00:23:28.309 position:16% line:83% align:start
And why am I the butt of
the joke in my own dream?

00:23:28.441 --> 00:23:29.677 position:41% line:89% align:start
[thuds]

00:23:32.346 --> 00:23:33.581 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:23:35.783 --> 00:23:38.252 position:19% line:89% align:start
Kurage. What was that?

00:23:38.451 --> 00:23:41.454 position:38% line:83% align:start
I call it
"super surprise concrete."

00:23:43.991 --> 00:23:45.860 position:30% line:83% align:start
Not that I have
room to complain,

00:23:45.993 --> 00:23:48.663 position:21% line:83% align:start
but you could've used
something a little softer.

00:23:48.796 --> 00:23:50.231 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
Good morning.

00:23:50.398 --> 00:23:51.632 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:54.201 position:24% line:89% align:start
Here's a question.

00:23:54.335 --> 00:23:57.138 position:27% line:83% align:start
What's something
that's impossible to do alone?

00:23:57.505 --> 00:23:58.806 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh. Kiss?

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.174 position:35% line:89% align:start
Uh. Marry?

00:24:00.308 --> 00:24:01.642 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh. Hug?

00:24:01.909 --> 00:24:03.010 position:38% line:89% align:start
Have sex!

00:24:03.144 --> 00:24:04.512 position:33% line:89% align:start
All correct.

00:24:04.879 --> 00:24:07.148 position:24% line:89% align:start
And all so worldly.
