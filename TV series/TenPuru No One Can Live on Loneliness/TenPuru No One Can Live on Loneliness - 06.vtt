00:07:27.949 --> 00:07:29.750 position:30% line:83% align:start
then we'll need
to have Akagami prepare

00:07:29.884 --> 00:07:31.619 position:27% line:83% align:start
a smaller portion
of food for every meal.

No, you're missing the point!

00:07:33.554 --> 00:07:36.390 position:10% line:83% align:start
We can't have Akagami finding
out we're all dieting.

Such sweet innocence.

What a subtle
flirt you are, Tsukuyo.

I'm a what?

00:07:49.236 --> 00:07:51.272 position:19% line:83% align:start
Hey, here's a thought.
Maybe you should marry him!

00:07:51.405 --> 00:07:52.540 position:38% line:89% align:start

00:07:52.673 --> 00:07:54.442 position:41% line:89% align:start
No way!

Kagura, what
are you talking about?

00:07:56.577 --> 00:07:58.245 position:7% line:89% align:start
I think it's an excellent idea.

00:07:58.379 --> 00:07:59.246 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:00.948 position:38% line:89% align:start
You, too?

00:08:01.082 --> 00:08:02.750 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] Now that Akagami's
been here with us for a while,

00:08:02.883 --> 00:08:04.885 position:30% line:83% align:start
I think of him
as part of the family.

00:08:05.386 --> 00:08:08.956 position:21% line:83% align:start
I'd really like it if
he could stay here forever.

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:10.490 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kurage.

00:08:10.624 --> 00:08:13.594 position:5% line:83% align:start
[KURAGE] And I was just thinking
that if you and he got married,

00:08:13.728 --> 00:08:15.463 position:5% line:89% align:start
that might actually be possible.

00:08:15.596 --> 00:08:18.165 position:30% line:83% align:start
I see. You care
for Akagami that much.

00:08:18.299 --> 00:08:20.167 position:21% line:83% align:start
I guess if I'm being
completely honest,

00:08:20.301 --> 00:08:22.803 position:21% line:83% align:start
it's not so much him
as his cooking.

00:08:22.937 --> 00:08:25.706 position:10% line:83% align:start
If I have to give up a sister
to keep those meals coming,

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:27.541 position:24% line:83% align:start
that's a sacrifice
I'm willing to make.

00:08:27.675 --> 00:08:28.976 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:30.678 position:24% line:83% align:start
[BOTH] How on earth
can you say such a thing?

00:08:30.811 --> 00:08:32.279 position:7% line:89% align:start
Do you have the slightest idea

00:08:32.413 --> 00:08:34.415 position:10% line:83% align:start
how it makes me feel to hear
you talking like family

00:08:34.548 --> 00:08:35.950 position:7% line:89% align:start
and food are on the same level?

00:08:36.083 --> 00:08:38.719 position:30% line:83% align:start
Are you afraid
that I'll eat you, or...

00:08:38.853 --> 00:08:41.055 position:21% line:83% align:start
Aah! Those nutrients
aren't getting to your brain!

00:08:41.188 --> 00:08:45.459 position:16% line:83% align:start
Anyway. Yuzuki's engaged,
making her all but useless,

00:08:45.593 --> 00:08:47.595 position:13% line:89% align:start
so it's up to you, Tsukuyo.

00:08:47.728 --> 00:08:50.097 position:7% line:89% align:start
Will you marry Akagami, please?

00:08:50.231 --> 00:08:52.666 position:10% line:83% align:start
Aren't you treating marriage
a little too lightly here?

00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.969 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hey. Why don't you marry him?

00:08:55.102 --> 00:08:58.072 position:27% line:83% align:start
It was your idea,
so there's no problem, is there?

00:08:58.205 --> 00:08:59.140 position:30% line:89% align:start
You get it now?

00:08:59.273 --> 00:09:01.675 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh! Yes.

00:09:01.809 --> 00:09:04.145 position:13% line:89% align:start

[YUZUKI]
I just realized something.

00:09:10.284 --> 00:09:12.553 position:19% line:83% align:start
Akagami's cooking tends
to be mostly vegetarian

00:09:12.686 --> 00:09:14.221 position:21% line:89% align:start
and low-calorie fare.

00:09:14.355 --> 00:09:17.191 position:5% line:83% align:start
Maybe what we're experiencing is
nothing more than growth spurts!

00:09:17.324 --> 00:09:18.993 position:16% line:89% align:start
Of course! Growth spurts!

Yeah, okay.

00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.866 position:10% line:83% align:start

about!

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.202 position:27% line:83% align:start
We're all exactly
where we should be!

00:13:47.127 --> 00:13:48.295 position:10% line:89% align:start
in order to begin training...

00:13:48.429 --> 00:13:50.097 position:7% line:89% align:start
It's supposed to last two days,

00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:52.534 position:21% line:83% align:start
and yet you only made
it two hours.

00:13:52.667 --> 00:13:53.702 position:41% line:89% align:start
I know.

00:13:53.834 --> 00:13:55.002 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:13:55.135 --> 00:13:57.404 position:27% line:83% align:start
Was the axe part
of her training, too?

00:13:57.539 --> 00:13:59.907 position:13% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] That was to practice
chopping firewood,

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:02.409 position:5% line:89% align:start
one of a trainee's daily chores.

00:14:02.544 --> 00:14:06.080 position:13% line:83% align:start
Oh. I thought she was gonna
use it to chop my head off.

00:14:06.781 --> 00:14:07.948 position:24% line:89% align:start
What? Why would I?

00:14:08.082 --> 00:14:09.617 position:21% line:83% align:start
The rules of training
are strict.

00:14:09.751 --> 00:14:11.952 position:33% line:83% align:start
For instance,
when you're eating your meals?

00:14:12.086 --> 00:14:13.354 position:38% line:89% align:start
Get this.

00:14:13.487 --> 00:14:15.456 position:13% line:83% align:start
You're not permitted to say
a word. Never.

00:14:15.590 --> 00:14:18.125 position:7% line:83% align:start
Even if you happen to be eating
pickled radishes.

00:14:18.258 --> 00:14:19.694 position:33% line:83% align:start
That was part
of her training, too?

00:14:19.828 --> 00:14:23.030 position:16% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Still, her biggest
obstacle is her clumsiness.

00:14:23.163 --> 00:14:25.966 position:16% line:83% align:start
She needs to practice so
she can become head priest

00:14:26.100 --> 00:14:27.101 position:21% line:89% align:start
as soon as possible.

00:14:27.234 --> 00:14:29.169 position:33% line:83% align:start
-Well, said.
-You agree?

00:14:29.303 --> 00:14:30.904 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
So, that's the situation.

00:14:31.038 --> 00:14:35.342 position:10% line:83% align:start
I'm terribly sorry to impose,
but I'd appreciate your help.

00:14:35.476 --> 00:14:36.845 position:27% line:89% align:start
It's my pleasure.

00:14:36.977 --> 00:14:39.614 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
That Yuzuki. So dedicated.

00:14:40.481 --> 00:14:42.517 position:13% line:83% align:start
Much as I'd like to pursue
my own enlightenment,

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:46.721 position:13% line:83% align:start
for now I'll devote all my
energy to supporting her.

00:14:46.855 --> 00:14:48.322 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
One other thing.

00:14:49.490 --> 00:14:52.126 position:30% line:83% align:start
Tell me. Would
you like to train alongside her?

00:14:52.259 --> 00:14:53.927 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh!
-Uh!

00:14:54.061 --> 00:14:55.462 position:24% line:89% align:start
Whoa, can I really?

00:14:55.597 --> 00:14:58.232 position:19% line:83% align:start
I mean, not like I had
any choice but to ask you.

00:14:58.365 --> 00:15:01.235 position:7% line:83% align:start
You looked like you were about
to attack Yuzuki if I didn't.

00:15:01.368 --> 00:15:03.036 position:30% line:83% align:start
Is that really
what I looked like?

00:15:03.170 --> 00:15:04.438 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry!

00:15:04.572 --> 00:15:08.610 position:30% line:83% align:start
Listen. Really.
It's okay if I can't.

00:15:08.743 --> 00:15:10.578 position:7% line:89% align:start
I know I've got a debt to pay.

00:15:10.712 --> 00:15:12.212 position:30% line:89% align:start
Don't be silly.

00:15:12.346 --> 00:15:14.982 position:7% line:83% align:start
I've seen how hard you've been
working at this temple.

00:15:15.115 --> 00:15:16.651 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've more than earned it.

00:15:16.785 --> 00:15:18.252 position:33% line:89% align:start
Rest assured,

00:15:18.385 --> 00:15:20.988 position:7% line:83% align:start
all the time you've spent here
hasn't gone to waste.

00:15:24.425 --> 00:15:27.695 position:24% line:83% align:start
A training partner.
That sounds encouraging.

00:15:30.330 --> 00:15:32.433 position:21% line:83% align:start
-I gratefully accept.
-Good.

00:15:33.167 --> 00:15:35.770 position:19% line:83% align:start
Yuzuki, I look forward
to training with you.

00:15:35.904 --> 00:15:37.304 position:13% line:89% align:start
Let's do our best, Akagami.

00:15:37.438 --> 00:15:39.406 position:33% line:83% align:start
-[BOTH laugh]
-Yes! You said it!

00:15:39.541 --> 00:15:40.608 position:38% line:89% align:start
[laughs]

00:15:41.709 --> 00:15:44.111 position:21% line:83% align:start
-Sorry to interrupt!
-[AKEMITSU] Mia?

00:15:44.244 --> 00:15:46.748 position:24% line:83% align:start
If I may, I'd like
to join the training as well!

00:15:46.881 --> 00:15:48.616 position:41% line:89% align:start
Go, go.

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:51.519 position:7% line:89% align:start
You'll train with us too, Mia?

00:15:51.653 --> 00:15:54.188 position:16% line:83% align:start
-Now that's encouraging!
-It is?

00:15:54.321 --> 00:15:56.190 position:35% line:83% align:start
Of course!
We'd love to have you!

00:15:56.323 --> 00:15:57.759 position:24% line:89% align:start
Oh, good! I'm glad!

00:15:57.892 --> 00:16:00.327 position:13% line:83% align:start
Thank you for training me.
I promise to work hard!

00:16:00.461 --> 00:16:01.763 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
Yeah, great.

00:16:01.896 --> 00:16:03.397 position:44% line:89% align:start
Aah!

00:16:03.531 --> 00:16:05.533 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] There's nothing
we can't face if we're together!

00:16:05.667 --> 00:16:07.502 position:33% line:89% align:start
[BOTH laugh]

00:16:08.302 --> 00:16:09.737 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Hey, I'm home.

00:16:10.404 --> 00:16:12.139 position:24% line:89% align:start
This is a surprise.

00:16:12.272 --> 00:16:13.942 position:13% line:89% align:start
You're training with Yuzu?

00:16:14.074 --> 00:16:16.410 position:27% line:83% align:start
Then you two will
be studying under Kiki?

00:16:16.544 --> 00:16:18.847 position:30% line:83% align:start
-That's right!
-Apparently, that's the case!

00:16:18.979 --> 00:16:21.549 position:16% line:89% align:start
I see. And that means...

00:16:21.683 --> 00:16:23.016 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sips]

00:16:24.686 --> 00:16:25.954 position:16% line:89% align:start
...you'll undergo tokudo.

00:16:26.119 --> 00:16:27.555 position:19% line:89% align:start
Hope you two are ready.

00:16:28.088 --> 00:16:29.256 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Tokudo?
-Tokudo?

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:33.160 position:41% line:83% align:start
[KIKI]
Oh, yeah.

00:16:33.293 --> 00:16:35.597 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess it slipped
my mind somehow.

00:16:35.730 --> 00:16:37.030 position:38% line:83% align:start
-Master.
-Master.

00:16:37.164 --> 00:16:39.466 position:5% line:83% align:start
There are many steps on the path
to priesthood.

00:16:39.601 --> 00:16:43.638 position:10% line:83% align:start
To enter the training ground,
one must first undergo "tokudo."

00:16:43.771 --> 00:16:45.038 position:21% line:89% align:start
There's a lot to it.

00:16:45.172 --> 00:16:47.374 position:24% line:83% align:start
Like reading sutras
and assorted other texts

00:16:47.509 --> 00:16:49.878 position:30% line:83% align:start
and performing
all kinds of rituals.

00:16:50.444 --> 00:16:53.648 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yeah. Basically, it's how
one would become a priest.

00:16:53.781 --> 00:16:55.315 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Oh, okay.

00:16:55.449 --> 00:17:00.053 position:16% line:83% align:start
Hmm! So to be clear, does
that mean I'm not a priest yet?

00:17:00.187 --> 00:17:01.355 position:47% line:89% align:start
Uh!

00:17:01.488 --> 00:17:02.524 position:38% line:89% align:start
Mmm-mmm!

00:17:02.657 --> 00:17:04.157 position:27% line:83% align:start
You're just some
guy who lives at a temple.

00:17:04.291 --> 00:17:07.629 position:10% line:89% align:start
I see. Just some guy. Really.

00:17:07.762 --> 00:17:08.997 position:33% line:89% align:start
[ALL giggle]

-[screams]
-What's the matter, Akagami?

00:17:12.065 --> 00:17:14.636 position:13% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] The only reason
I've remained sane despite

00:17:14.769 --> 00:17:16.203 position:16% line:89% align:start
being surrounded by women

00:17:16.336 --> 00:17:19.172 position:5% line:83% align:start
was because I sincerely believed
I had become a priest.

00:17:19.306 --> 00:17:21.241 position:30% line:83% align:start
Absolutely that
is when I am dreaming about.

00:17:21.375 --> 00:17:23.545 position:35% line:83% align:start
-[giggles]
-Yes! Yes! Yes!

00:17:23.678 --> 00:17:27.949 position:7% line:83% align:start
Now that I've been disabused of
that notion, my desires...

00:17:28.081 --> 00:17:30.350 position:33% line:83% align:start
-My desires!
-Calm down, Akagami!

00:17:30.484 --> 00:17:32.787 position:7% line:89% align:start
Yes, you must try to calm down.

00:17:32.921 --> 00:17:35.355 position:13% line:83% align:start
[MIA] Somehow I don't think
you're helping matters!

00:17:35.489 --> 00:17:38.191 position:19% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] I'm teaching him
to resist his desires.

00:17:38.325 --> 00:17:40.628 position:33% line:83% align:start
I'm perfectly
capable of handling that!

00:17:41.128 --> 00:17:46.166 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh! No. I, uh-

00:17:47.401 --> 00:17:49.837 position:13% line:83% align:start
So, does this mean my path
to enlightenment

00:17:49.971 --> 00:17:51.471 position:13% line:89% align:start
was an illusion all along?

00:17:51.606 --> 00:17:52.941 position:38% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI]
No, it wasn't.

00:17:53.073 --> 00:17:54.274 position:41% line:89% align:start
[gasps]

00:17:54.408 --> 00:17:55.843 position:16% line:89% align:start
You desire enlightenment.

00:17:55.977 --> 00:17:59.446 position:7% line:83% align:start
That in itself is an important
part of the path.

00:17:59.581 --> 00:18:03.417 position:5% line:83% align:start
The second key to enlightenment.
So take heart. You've got this.

00:18:03.551 --> 00:18:04.919 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Yuzuki.

00:18:05.053 --> 00:18:08.221 position:13% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Kiki! I completed
six hours of teizu.

00:18:08.355 --> 00:18:10.223 position:35% line:89% align:start
Oh? Really?

00:18:10.357 --> 00:18:12.827 position:33% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Hmm!
It wasn't so hard after-

00:18:12.961 --> 00:18:17.899 position:7% line:83% align:start
Take that. And this. And that.
And this and this.

00:18:18.032 --> 00:18:20.735 position:10% line:83% align:start
And that. And that. And this.
-Please stop.

00:18:20.868 --> 00:18:21.869 position:38% line:89% align:start
[groans]

00:18:22.003 --> 00:18:23.838 position:16% line:89% align:start
You've got a ways to go.

00:18:23.972 --> 00:18:26.674 position:35% line:83% align:start
Come, now.
Time to go chop some firewood.

00:18:26.808 --> 00:18:30.945 position:27% line:83% align:start
Uh! Oh! Thank you
for your guidance, master!

00:18:31.411 --> 00:18:36.183 position:27% line:83% align:start
She's so amazing.
Man, I can't keep up.

00:18:36.316 --> 00:18:38.151 position:24% line:89% align:start
You think so, huh?

00:18:39.587 --> 00:18:41.321 position:41% line:89% align:start
[yells]

00:18:41.455 --> 00:18:44.659 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KIKI] Yuzuki hasn't
undergone tokudo yet, either.

00:18:44.792 --> 00:18:45.392 position:41% line:83% align:start
[BOTH]
Uh!

00:18:45.526 --> 00:18:46.928 position:24% line:89% align:start
Are you surprised?

00:18:47.061 --> 00:18:49.396 position:10% line:83% align:start
She may have spent more time
here at the temple,

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.132 position:24% line:83% align:start
but you and she are
effectively at the same level.

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:53.901 position:16% line:83% align:start
So, if there's something
about her

00:18:54.035 --> 00:18:55.637 position:10% line:89% align:start
that gives you the impression

00:18:55.770 --> 00:18:59.139 position:10% line:83% align:start
she's that far ahead of you,
it's probably just her mindset.

00:18:59.607 --> 00:19:01.009 position:47% line:89% align:start
Hm!

00:19:01.141 --> 00:19:04.579 position:7% line:83% align:start
You see, students usually spend
a year training for tokudo.

00:19:04.712 --> 00:19:07.280 position:21% line:83% align:start
She's trying to do it
in half that time

00:19:07.414 --> 00:19:09.951 position:21% line:83% align:start
while simultaneously
attending school.

00:19:10.084 --> 00:19:13.888 position:21% line:83% align:start
To become head priest
just as quickly as possible.

[sighs]

00:19:15.455 --> 00:19:16.557 position:24% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] All for
the sake of making sure

00:19:16.691 --> 00:19:18.660 position:13% line:89% align:start
Mikazuki Temple stays open.

00:19:18.793 --> 00:19:22.030 position:47% line:83% align:start
Uh!
I need to step it up, as well!

Would you please
allow me to join you?

00:19:35.043 --> 00:19:36.611 position:38% line:89% align:start
Finally!

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:39.147 position:35% line:89% align:start
Yuzuki. Uh!

00:19:39.279 --> 00:19:41.949 position:38% line:83% align:start
You said
that we'd face this together.

00:19:42.083 --> 00:19:43.216 position:41% line:89% align:start
[sobs]

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:45.653 position:38% line:83% align:start
Come on!
Look, I'd never cut you out.

00:19:45.787 --> 00:19:48.623 position:30% line:83% align:start
We were hoping
that you'd join us. Right?

00:19:50.024 --> 00:19:52.292 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, let's become masters
at chopping firewood

00:19:52.426 --> 00:19:54.361 position:16% line:89% align:start
so we can undergo tokudo!

00:19:54.494 --> 00:19:55.797 position:44% line:83% align:start
[ALL]
Yeah!

00:19:55.930 --> 00:19:57.532 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL laugh]

00:19:57.665 --> 00:20:01.301 position:10% line:83% align:start
Chopping firewood really has
nothing to do it. But whatever.

00:20:01.936 --> 00:20:06.206 position:27% line:83% align:start
Excuse me. Kiki,
Yuzuki, we have a visitor.

00:20:06.339 --> 00:20:07.407 position:27% line:89% align:start
Sorry to intrude.

00:20:07.542 --> 00:20:09.744 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Gah.
-Hoan, it's you!

00:20:09.877 --> 00:20:11.512 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Huh?
-Aw?

00:20:14.682 --> 00:20:15.650 position:19% line:83% align:start
-[KURAGE] Interesting.
-[TSUKUYO] Interesting.

00:20:15.783 --> 00:20:18.019 position:7% line:89% align:start
So, that guy is Yuzu's fiancÃ©.

00:20:18.152 --> 00:20:20.021 position:16% line:89% align:start
But what's he doing here?

00:20:20.154 --> 00:20:21.589 position:30% line:89% align:start
I have no idea.

00:20:21.723 --> 00:20:24.625 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? He's not here
to get down and dirty with her?

00:20:24.759 --> 00:20:25.560 position:38% line:89% align:start
[purring]

00:20:25.693 --> 00:20:26.728 position:41% line:89% align:start
Kurage!

00:20:26.861 --> 00:20:28.029 position:30% line:83% align:start
I mean, they're
engaged, aren't they?

00:20:28.162 --> 00:20:29.362 position:24% line:89% align:start
It's only natural.

00:20:29.496 --> 00:20:30.898 position:38% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA]
My, my.

00:20:31.032 --> 00:20:34.635 position:16% line:83% align:start
Yuzu wouldn't do anything
like that. Right, Akagami?

00:20:34.769 --> 00:20:36.336 position:19% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU] Is he taking
advantage of his

00:20:36.470 --> 00:20:39.339 position:19% line:83% align:start
and Yuzuki's engagement
to do things with her?

00:20:39.473 --> 00:20:40.775 position:24% line:89% align:start
You mean it's true?

00:20:40.908 --> 00:20:42.375 position:21% line:83% align:start
[KAGURA] Think of it
as kind of a training

00:20:42.510 --> 00:20:44.178 position:13% line:89% align:start
mostly for the lower body.

00:20:44.311 --> 00:20:46.647 position:30% line:83% align:start
How intriguing!
How very intriguing!

00:20:46.781 --> 00:20:48.583 position:13% line:83% align:start
I'm getting kind of worried
about this.

00:20:48.716 --> 00:20:51.384 position:13% line:83% align:start
Maybe I should keep an eye
on them till they're done.

00:20:51.519 --> 00:20:53.521 position:24% line:83% align:start
You're all enjoying
this way too much.

00:20:53.654 --> 00:20:55.790 position:5% line:89% align:start
Ah, you must be Yuzuki's family.

00:20:55.923 --> 00:20:57.290 position:38% line:89% align:start
[screams]

00:20:57.859 --> 00:21:00.260 position:5% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] My apologies for dropping
in unannounced.

00:21:00.393 --> 00:21:01.428 position:19% line:89% align:start
I had to see the temple

00:21:01.562 --> 00:21:04.232 position:27% line:83% align:start
and family Yuzuki
was so proud of.

00:21:04.364 --> 00:21:06.534 position:38% line:83% align:start
[TSUKUYO]
Oh, yeah. Sure.

00:21:06.667 --> 00:21:09.369 position:10% line:83% align:start
[HOAN] That said, I have some
business here, as well.

00:21:09.504 --> 00:21:10.605 position:24% line:89% align:start
Akagami, wasn't it?

00:21:10.738 --> 00:21:12.106 position:21% line:89% align:start
Do you have a moment?

00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:13.574 position:38% line:89% align:start
Uh, sure.

00:21:14.842 --> 00:21:19.247 position:33% line:83% align:start
Oh, dear me.
It's even worse than I imagined.

00:21:19.379 --> 00:21:20.848 position:33% line:89% align:start
I'm so sorry.

00:21:20.982 --> 00:21:23.518 position:21% line:83% align:start
Hm! If you don't like
it here, then just leave.

00:21:23.651 --> 00:21:26.020 position:24% line:83% align:start
Huh? Kiki, when did
you change your clothes?

00:21:26.154 --> 00:21:28.990 position:35% line:83% align:start
[AKEMITSU]
Exactly why am I here right now?

00:21:29.123 --> 00:21:30.925 position:16% line:89% align:start
Still the same old Kiki.

00:21:31.959 --> 00:21:35.997 position:16% line:83% align:start
Now, Yuzuki. I understand
you still aren't a priest yet.

00:21:36.130 --> 00:21:37.430 position:38% line:89% align:start
Correct.

00:21:37.565 --> 00:21:40.535 position:13% line:83% align:start
Wanna make something of it?
Huh, big shot?

00:21:40.668 --> 00:21:42.970 position:10% line:83% align:start
[YUZUKI] Kiki, what on earth
has gotten into you?

00:21:43.104 --> 00:21:44.872 position:10% line:89% align:start
Hm! Now, get a load of this!

00:21:45.006 --> 00:21:47.542 position:24% line:83% align:start
It just so happens
that I'm her master now.

00:21:47.675 --> 00:21:49.110 position:5% line:89% align:start
You come back here in six months

00:21:49.243 --> 00:21:51.913 position:21% line:83% align:start
and this one will be
the baddest priest you ever saw!

00:21:52.046 --> 00:21:53.714 position:30% line:89% align:start
Uh. Hey, Kiki?

00:21:54.515 --> 00:21:56.250 position:10% line:89% align:start
That's going to be too late.

00:21:56.383 --> 00:21:57.785 position:44% line:83% align:start
-Uh!
-Uh!

00:21:57.919 --> 00:22:01.321 position:21% line:83% align:start
She'll need to finish
within three months' time.

00:22:03.124 --> 00:22:04.625 position:13% line:89% align:start
You've gotta be kidding me.

00:22:04.759 --> 00:22:07.662 position:24% line:83% align:start
You know full well
how strict our tokudo is.

00:22:07.795 --> 00:22:09.597 position:41% line:83% align:start
[HOAN]
Too much of a challenge?

00:22:09.730 --> 00:22:13.100 position:24% line:83% align:start
If that's the case,
then the engagement is off.

00:22:13.868 --> 00:22:16.571 position:35% line:89% align:start
[ALL gasp]

00:22:16.704 --> 00:22:18.840 position:50% line:89% align:start
âª

00:23:52.867 --> 00:23:55.136 position:33% line:83% align:start
Hey, Tsukuyo,
what's your favorite color?

00:23:55.269 --> 00:23:57.939 position:24% line:83% align:start
I guess it's pink.
Light blue's good, too.

00:23:58.072 --> 00:24:00.440 position:21% line:83% align:start
And then there's red,
the color of passion.

00:24:00.574 --> 00:24:03.711 position:27% line:83% align:start
How bold of you.
And what's today's color?

00:24:03.844 --> 00:24:06.047 position:38% line:83% align:start
Hold on,
what are we talking about?
