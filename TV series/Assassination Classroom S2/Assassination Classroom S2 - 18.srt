1
00:00:11,039 --> 00:00:13,006
From behind at point-blank range?

2
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,915
Like a bolt of lightning outta the clear blue sky.

3
00:00:16,565 --> 00:00:18,256
Where in the world has he been hiding?

4
00:00:21,731 --> 00:00:22,643
Of course.

5
00:00:23,356 --> 00:00:25,218
He was shadowing Mr. Karasuma,

6
00:00:26,064 --> 00:00:28,412
blending in with his Self-Defense Force camo.

7
00:00:29,606 --> 00:00:32,456
Waiting to pick us off from the ideal sniper's nest.

8
00:00:36,023 --> 00:00:36,682
Gotcha!

9
00:00:42,861 --> 00:00:45,931
This is exactly why being around Nagisa has me on edge.

10
00:00:46,953 --> 00:00:48,704
I guess it's one-on-one now.

11
00:00:49,398 --> 00:00:50,395
Fine by me.

12
00:00:50,856 --> 00:00:51,896
Let's finish it.

13
00:02:34,564 --> 00:02:37,118
So it comes down to Nagisa versus Karma.

14
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:39,231
Ballsy tactic.

15
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:42,773
The kid essentially used Karasuma
as his own personal blind.

16
00:02:42,856 --> 00:02:45,864
A referee goes largely unnoticed on the playing field.

17
00:02:46,898 --> 00:02:50,148
Nagisa honed in on that fact, made himself invisible.

18
00:02:50,231 --> 00:02:50,967
Brilliant!

19
00:02:51,282 --> 00:02:53,850
He waited for the perfect moment to reveal himself.

20
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:57,187
His instincts are that of a natural-born killer.

21
00:02:58,189 --> 00:03:00,483
It's not wise to underestimate Karma, though.

22
00:03:01,148 --> 00:03:04,314
Comparing these two on the basis of academic performance,

23
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:07,808
he soundly beats Nagisa in every area of study.

24
00:03:08,189 --> 00:03:10,820
That said, the fact must've dawned on him.

25
00:03:11,939 --> 00:03:14,117
When it comes to matters of assassination,

26
00:03:14,386 --> 00:03:18,239
Nagisa is, without question, Karma's greatest adversary.

27
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,016
Damn. He's already moved.

28
00:03:25,456 --> 00:03:29,037
Nagisa! Put down the gun and come on out!

29
00:03:29,262 --> 00:03:31,220
We'll settle this with blades!

30
00:03:32,273 --> 00:03:34,400
No way! Don't be an idiot!

31
00:03:34,456 --> 00:03:36,338
Take him out while you've got the shot!

32
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,040
I don't think he's gonna fire.

33
00:03:40,746 --> 00:03:44,308
Karma. He always plays so dirty.

34
00:03:45,872 --> 00:03:48,376
If I ignore his challenge and shoot him right now,

35
00:03:48,939 --> 00:03:52,388
you can bet the red team'll be
hard-pressed to concede defeat.

36
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,604
He's counting on me to know that.

37
00:03:58,356 --> 00:04:01,714
If I want everyone on board with saving Koro-sensei,

38
00:04:02,023 --> 00:04:04,487
this has to play out on Karma's terms.

39
00:04:05,616 --> 00:04:07,713
I have to beat him at his own specialty.

40
00:04:08,231 --> 00:04:09,237
Seriously?

41
00:04:09,398 --> 00:04:11,314
No! They're going mano a mano?

42
00:04:11,373 --> 00:04:12,373
And it makes sense.

43
00:04:12,488 --> 00:04:14,587
Nagisa respects Karma in a big way,

44
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:16,897
and he needs him to understand where he's coming from.

45
00:04:17,427 --> 00:04:19,035
Let's move in for a better view!

46
00:04:21,898 --> 00:04:23,062
Not gonna lie.

47
00:04:23,228 --> 00:04:25,312
I'm still for not killing Koro-sensei,

48
00:04:25,356 --> 00:04:29,108
but... seeing Karma just put himself out there like that?

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,914
When I tagged Rinka, I felt the same way.

50
00:04:34,523 --> 00:04:36,917
Supposing we wind up having to kill him,

51
00:04:37,398 --> 00:04:38,960
what would that feel like?

52
00:04:39,398 --> 00:04:42,731
And now we watch the flip-floppers
crawl out of the woodwork.

53
00:04:43,148 --> 00:04:47,633
Must be some correlation between strong
opinions and working camouflage, huh?

54
00:04:47,898 --> 00:04:51,168
A class like this pulls unexpected things outta everybody.

55
00:04:51,193 --> 00:04:54,449
You, Kayano, Mimura, and Kanzaki, for example.

56
00:04:54,722 --> 00:04:55,888
Some go berserk.

57
00:04:55,937 --> 00:04:58,145
Some get all fired up to do better next time.

58
00:04:58,189 --> 00:05:01,189
Some we assume are slackers
turn out to actually have a plan.

59
00:05:01,273 --> 00:05:04,439
Some who pass themselves off as
jokers turn out to be dead serious.

60
00:05:04,523 --> 00:05:05,453
Oh, shut up.

61
00:05:05,648 --> 00:05:10,195
And weirdest of all, not only does the runt
of the litter turn out to be a genius assassin,

62
00:05:10,534 --> 00:05:14,137
the guy we all thought this came
easiest to has gotta work his ass off.

63
00:05:15,239 --> 00:05:17,721
So, whoever wins this has my respect.

64
00:05:18,439 --> 00:05:20,852
With the crazy skillsets
we have as a group,

65
00:05:21,459 --> 00:05:24,761
something tells me we can handle
any challenge that comes our way.

66
00:05:32,305 --> 00:05:34,381
Ever since we met as First Years,

67
00:05:34,981 --> 00:05:37,424
to put it simply, I've looked up to him.

68
00:05:38,981 --> 00:05:40,944
Excuse me, sir? What's this?

69
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:43,206
Whoa, Akabane.

70
00:05:43,231 --> 00:05:44,979
That's second-year stuff you're lookin' at.

71
00:05:45,387 --> 00:05:48,126
He did whatever he pleased, without fear.

72
00:05:48,312 --> 00:05:50,312
And he was absolutely brilliant.

73
00:05:50,347 --> 00:05:52,146
Okay. That's all I needed.

74
00:05:52,273 --> 00:05:54,369
I can handle the rest on my own, thanks.

75
00:05:54,675 --> 00:05:55,086
Mm?

76
00:05:55,481 --> 00:05:56,817
What? You're kidding me.

77
00:05:57,731 --> 00:05:59,908
By the way, Teach, I'm just gonna leave now.

78
00:06:00,773 --> 00:06:02,823
If only I could be like that.

79
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:06,884
From where I stood, Karma
seemed to have it all figured out.

80
00:06:08,606 --> 00:06:09,640
Wait, really?

81
00:06:09,772 --> 00:06:12,611
Nazzoni directed "Sonic Ninja"? And it's out now?

82
00:06:12,648 --> 00:06:13,699
That's awesome!

83
00:06:14,106 --> 00:06:16,250
Didn't even know. We should go see it!

84
00:06:16,564 --> 00:06:18,466
Are you cool to come with me, Shiota?

85
00:06:23,106 --> 00:06:24,156
All of a sudden,

86
00:06:24,181 --> 00:06:26,913
we were hanging out and I felt six feet tall.

87
00:06:27,606 --> 00:06:29,543
That was halfway through our first year.

88
00:06:29,981 --> 00:06:30,910
Life was good.

89
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:37,742
But it wasn't long before I learned
that all good things come to an end.

90
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,561
Well, well, what do we have here?

91
00:06:40,939 --> 00:06:43,523
You beat my good buddy to a pulp and you're still walkin'.

92
00:06:43,606 --> 00:06:45,725
Huh? Yeah, I s'pose I am.

93
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:47,522
For the record, your buddy started it.

94
00:06:47,706 --> 00:06:48,721
He had it comin'.

95
00:06:48,754 --> 00:06:51,004
You're fulla crap! See, accordin' to him...

96
00:06:57,247 --> 00:06:58,539
Come again, please?

97
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:00,898
I'm havin' a little trouble understandin' ya.

98
00:07:00,981 --> 00:07:04,826
He could do whatever he pleased
because he had the strength to back himself up.

99
00:07:07,064 --> 00:07:08,935
Not a place I was ever gonna be.

100
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:12,963
He must've gotten bored sharing the stage with a nobody.

101
00:07:14,956 --> 00:07:16,577
By the time they suspended him,

102
00:07:17,111 --> 00:07:19,404
we'd gone back to being just classmates.

103
00:07:21,814 --> 00:07:24,132
He's always been a harmless little mouse.

104
00:07:24,731 --> 00:07:28,001
A guy with my rep has to be
on high alert around most folks.

105
00:07:28,661 --> 00:07:29,780
Not with him, though.

106
00:07:30,439 --> 00:07:31,743
Looking back on it now,

107
00:07:32,314 --> 00:07:34,428
I'm the one who put the distance between us.

108
00:07:35,103 --> 00:07:38,369
Even then, there was something
about him that made me nervous.

109
00:07:43,203 --> 00:07:46,394
Now where'd he'd run off to? Hey, Nagisa!

110
00:07:47,255 --> 00:07:49,325
I could put my guard down around him.

111
00:07:52,939 --> 00:07:54,577
I've right been here the whole time.

112
00:07:54,704 --> 00:07:55,904
You didn't see me?

113
00:07:57,770 --> 00:08:00,011
But for some reason, he had me on edge.

114
00:08:00,545 --> 00:08:03,698
It was like, if he wanted he
could've killed me in my sleep.

115
00:08:04,398 --> 00:08:07,036
Always so sweet natured and honest.

116
00:08:08,292 --> 00:08:10,761
On the surface, we couldn't have been more different.

117
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,673
Still... beneath that innocent
façade lurked something else,

118
00:08:16,456 --> 00:08:18,215
something downright sinister.

119
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,305
I wanted to drag it out of him. Crush it.

120
00:08:22,856 --> 00:08:25,681
Not that there'd have been
any point fighting him in class.

121
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:29,328
Whatever he has, it's totally beyond all that.

122
00:08:30,554 --> 00:08:34,240
I couldn't deal. Before long, we'd drifted apart.

123
00:08:34,648 --> 00:08:35,645
And here we are.

124
00:08:36,337 --> 00:08:40,849
A couple of Third Years in a class on
assassination, staring each other down.

125
00:08:42,231 --> 00:08:43,033
This is it.

126
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,284
The only way to get our point across is to win.

127
00:08:47,821 --> 00:08:49,596
You are so going down!

128
00:09:02,523 --> 00:09:03,391
Nagisa.

129
00:09:04,189 --> 00:09:05,541
A desire to win.

130
00:09:05,898 --> 00:09:09,625
To conquer. The all-consuming competitive streak of youth!

131
00:09:10,832 --> 00:09:13,049
You must forget about me in this moment.

132
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:16,298
Clear your minds. It's about what's in front of you.

133
00:09:25,013 --> 00:09:25,846
We kill!

134
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:26,873
We save!

135
00:09:44,569 --> 00:09:47,439
I'm surprised a tackle that
well-timed didn't bring him down.

136
00:09:47,523 --> 00:09:50,232
There's a pretty big difference
in strength between the two of them.

137
00:09:50,481 --> 00:09:51,335
Indeed.

138
00:09:51,467 --> 00:09:53,378
If one knife connects, it's a win.

139
00:09:53,828 --> 00:09:57,461
Karma won't hesitate to use the
brief window of time to his advantage.

140
00:09:58,564 --> 00:10:01,044
Ah, but observe Nagisa closely.

141
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:03,420
He's carrying a second blade.

142
00:10:05,463 --> 00:10:07,313
You think he'll try the Clap Stunner?

143
00:10:07,898 --> 00:10:08,759
Unlikely.

144
00:10:09,098 --> 00:10:11,181
Karma will've noticed the hilt on his leg.

145
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:13,613
The second blade won't come as a surprise.

146
00:10:14,703 --> 00:10:17,865
Two assassins, their weapons and methods worlds apart.

147
00:10:17,998 --> 00:10:20,066
How will this contest be settled?

148
00:10:21,023 --> 00:10:22,869
Don't touch that dial, folks.

149
00:10:37,005 --> 00:10:38,380
If I don't wanna get inked,

150
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:40,389
the trick is to take the hits like a pro.

151
00:10:47,564 --> 00:10:48,221
Now!

152
00:10:50,906 --> 00:10:52,853
Nice. He got his knife away.

153
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:54,188
I've got this!

154
00:10:57,554 --> 00:10:59,012
Both their knives are out of reach!

155
00:10:59,186 --> 00:11:01,322
Wait, look. Not the one on his leg!

156
00:11:04,802 --> 00:11:05,391
Ha!

157
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:08,337
Don't even bother.

158
00:11:08,837 --> 00:11:11,379
The second you go for that blade, the fight belongs to me.

159
00:11:11,468 --> 00:11:15,559
I'll knock you on your ass and take
my sweet time with the final blow!

160
00:11:23,023 --> 00:11:23,506
Hm.

161
00:11:25,086 --> 00:11:26,737
Aw, that's all you got?

162
00:11:32,145 --> 00:11:35,654
Holy crap. He's taking Nagisa's attacks on purpose.

163
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:38,298
His hits have gotta be having some kind of effect, right?

164
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:40,849
I mean, he's been upping his game for a whole year now.

165
00:11:41,398 --> 00:11:44,225
Karma is first and foremost a combat assassin.

166
00:11:44,773 --> 00:11:48,046
He relishes process: The bargaining, the strategy.

167
00:11:48,313 --> 00:11:51,605
Only when he's gone through the
moves will he deal the decisive blow.

168
00:11:52,106 --> 00:11:54,689
Nagisa, on the other hand, is a pure assassin.

169
00:11:54,825 --> 00:11:58,162
Single-mindedly searching for the
one strike that will secure victory.

170
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,243
Karma has trained himself to take a beating.

171
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,228
Hit after hit,

172
00:12:01,298 --> 00:12:03,414
he'll stand his ground and give as good as he gets.

173
00:12:03,483 --> 00:12:04,939
Should he hold out indefinitely,

174
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:08,171
Nagisa will have no honorable choice but to accept defeat.

175
00:12:19,939 --> 00:12:21,289
That was an axe kick!

176
00:12:21,606 --> 00:12:22,898
Bring one of those to the table

177
00:12:22,981 --> 00:12:25,030
and the other guy doesn't have a chance in hell!

178
00:12:33,564 --> 00:12:34,651
Let's be real.

179
00:12:34,981 --> 00:12:38,004
There'll never be another place like this. Not ever.

180
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:41,901
No one else is gonna let me be honest about how I feel.

181
00:12:44,439 --> 00:12:45,792
But I will kill him.

182
00:12:46,981 --> 00:12:49,493
'Cause, like it or not, it's the right thing to do.

183
00:13:00,845 --> 00:13:02,094
What the...?

184
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:04,645
That's the last ounce of strength he's got.

185
00:13:04,705 --> 00:13:06,782
He bit his tongue to keep from dropping!

186
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:08,560
Go for it, Nagisa.

187
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,826
Come at me with all that natural talent I never had.

188
00:13:12,728 --> 00:13:14,815
I'll break you over my knee like a twig.

189
00:13:16,603 --> 00:13:18,062
This game is mine.

190
00:13:18,768 --> 00:13:20,581
It's all channeled into that blade.

191
00:13:20,953 --> 00:13:23,148
Dodge, and his bloodlust will dissolve.

192
00:13:26,356 --> 00:13:26,931
What the...?

193
00:13:27,731 --> 00:13:28,648
What's he doing?

194
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:33,653
A triangle choke!

195
00:13:33,981 --> 00:13:37,196
With his carotid cinched, it's only
a matter of time before he passes out.

196
00:13:37,439 --> 00:13:40,548
Nagisa's choke hold is even
more effective than it was earlier.

197
00:13:43,064 --> 00:13:43,511
Ugh.

198
00:13:43,997 --> 00:13:45,789
You are going to hear me out!

199
00:13:45,814 --> 00:13:46,529
Look at 'im!

200
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:49,381
How the hell is he pinning him
down like that in the first place?

201
00:13:49,773 --> 00:13:51,232
The element of surprise.

202
00:13:51,308 --> 00:13:54,331
Nagisa sacrificed his greatest
skill to create a red herring,

203
00:13:54,443 --> 00:13:56,643
opting to finish with a martial arts move.

204
00:13:56,728 --> 00:13:58,228
All to make a simple point:

205
00:13:58,273 --> 00:14:01,776
Karma's own specialty has, in
the end, been turned against him.

206
00:14:02,582 --> 00:14:04,764
Exactly like I tried to do to him.

207
00:14:05,023 --> 00:14:06,523
Playing by my terms,

208
00:14:06,664 --> 00:14:09,785
he's making it impossible for
anyone to contest the outcome.

209
00:14:10,873 --> 00:14:12,033
Ugh. Damn it.

210
00:14:12,312 --> 00:14:14,566
At this rate, I'm toast!

211
00:14:21,273 --> 00:14:22,164
He's got a knife!

212
00:14:22,307 --> 00:14:23,051
Oh no!

213
00:14:30,457 --> 00:14:31,913
No, I can't fight.

214
00:14:32,315 --> 00:14:34,874
I'm probably way too big of chicken to even try.

215
00:14:35,314 --> 00:14:38,355
Uh, unless it was absolutely a matter of life and death.

216
00:14:42,181 --> 00:14:43,115
I give up.

217
00:14:43,439 --> 00:14:44,758
Uncle. Uncle.

218
00:14:45,106 --> 00:14:47,198
You win, Nagisa. Good job.

219
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:51,097
Are you listening to me?

220
00:14:51,455 --> 00:14:52,247
That's enough!

221
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,720
Red Team has surrendered.

222
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:54,839
Game over.

223
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:56,596
Blue Team is the winner!

224
00:14:57,706 --> 00:14:59,527
Yeah!

225
00:15:00,454 --> 00:15:01,704
Okay. Cool.

226
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:03,825
You worked hard for that win, Nagisa.

227
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,146
I actually... won?

228
00:15:08,523 --> 00:15:09,735
I beat Karma?

229
00:15:10,439 --> 00:15:14,331
'Fore you start doin' a little victory dance,
let's make one thing perfectly clear.

230
00:15:14,424 --> 00:15:16,608
You left your back wide open to attack.

231
00:15:16,872 --> 00:15:18,953
I just couldn't bring myself to stab you.

232
00:15:19,814 --> 00:15:22,773
Talk about bein' stuck between a rock and hard place.

233
00:15:22,917 --> 00:15:25,483
No one would've been satisfied with me winning that way.

234
00:15:26,248 --> 00:15:29,368
Can't believe you managed to get
the drop on me with martial arts.

235
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:33,587
Seriously, dude, who'd have ever thought
I'd be beaten at my own game like that?

236
00:15:35,332 --> 00:15:36,233
You killed me.

237
00:15:36,831 --> 00:15:38,847
Right, you wanna save Koro-sensei?

238
00:15:39,314 --> 00:15:40,555
Talk. I'm listenin'.

239
00:15:42,689 --> 00:15:44,861
Are you really? No joke?

240
00:15:45,163 --> 00:15:48,329
Quit starin' at me like that.
You look like mousetrap cheese.

241
00:15:48,398 --> 00:15:50,804
I've seen fewer bruises on a week-old peach.

242
00:15:51,414 --> 00:15:52,010
Wow,

243
00:15:52,035 --> 00:15:55,180
even in defeat you can't bear
to waste a single insult, huh?

244
00:15:55,481 --> 00:15:56,516
Good ol' Karma.

245
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:58,448
Please.

246
00:16:00,564 --> 00:16:03,579
Look. Why don't we drop all the back-and-forth?

247
00:16:04,154 --> 00:16:06,360
I'm really not feelin' it after that fight.

248
00:16:07,189 --> 00:16:10,205
So what? We talk to each other like human beings?

249
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,540
Feels kinda weird after all this time.

250
00:16:13,523 --> 00:16:14,185
Fine.

251
00:16:14,580 --> 00:16:15,709
I'll start us off.

252
00:16:16,189 --> 00:16:19,261
Gimme your hand... old friend.

253
00:16:22,564 --> 00:16:23,419
Thanks, Karma.

254
00:16:24,439 --> 00:16:25,372
Old friend.

255
00:16:29,873 --> 00:16:33,340
True feelings tend to bubble up
when under pressure from a big decision.

256
00:16:33,564 --> 00:16:35,606
Often as not, there's conflict.

257
00:16:37,071 --> 00:16:39,821
But look. In the end, harmony reigns.

258
00:16:39,951 --> 00:16:42,606
Because these boys and girls have fought in earnest.

259
00:16:42,743 --> 00:16:45,712
They've come to see and appreciate
one another's true feelings.

260
00:16:46,448 --> 00:16:48,539
Only because I didn't want to paralyze ya.

261
00:16:48,618 --> 00:16:52,655
Sometimes conflict can be the best
opportunity to strengthen a friendship.

262
00:16:53,873 --> 00:16:54,982
Is that another lesson?

263
00:16:55,555 --> 00:16:58,153
Without strife, we can't grow or learn a damn thing?

264
00:17:02,856 --> 00:17:05,041
I'm sure you all have your own thoughts on the matter.

265
00:17:05,481 --> 00:17:08,775
I for one have no objection
to the course this class has chosen.

266
00:17:09,266 --> 00:17:10,124
That said,

267
00:17:10,173 --> 00:17:13,128
I can only allow you to try to save him on one condition.

268
00:17:13,664 --> 00:17:16,466
You have until the end of the month to figure out a way.

269
00:17:16,864 --> 00:17:19,589
You might be taking a break from assassination,

270
00:17:20,271 --> 00:17:23,831
but many others involved aren't.
Their efforts are in full swing.

271
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:26,357
If it turns out he needs to be killed,

272
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:28,828
I believe you should be the ones who do it.

273
00:17:29,956 --> 00:17:31,147
Make me a promise.

274
00:17:31,243 --> 00:17:32,967
However January plays out,

275
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:36,264
February onward, you'll focus on the original objective.

276
00:17:38,310 --> 00:17:41,293
Whether you save or kill, give it all you've got.

277
00:17:44,189 --> 00:17:45,084
Yes, sir!

278
00:19:17,265 --> 00:19:18,899
To put this in general terms...

279
00:19:19,564 --> 00:19:21,148
what about world leaders?

280
00:19:21,231 --> 00:19:24,578
Is assassinating Koro-sensei their only game plan?

281
00:19:25,023 --> 00:19:25,787
I doubt it.

282
00:19:26,189 --> 00:19:29,998
Bear in mind, the larger goal is to
save the Earth from certain destruction.

283
00:19:30,671 --> 00:19:32,305
They can't afford to be unilateral.

284
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,314
Odds are they've explored options
that don't involving killing him.

285
00:19:35,398 --> 00:19:37,697
Why don't we look into what those options might be?

286
00:19:38,418 --> 00:19:39,286
He's right.

287
00:19:39,431 --> 00:19:44,497
There're research facilities all over the world
dedicating themselves to the problem 24/7.

288
00:19:44,937 --> 00:19:47,620
Needless to say, their work is highly classified.

289
00:19:47,978 --> 00:19:50,383
Finding out what they know will be next to impossible.

290
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:53,106
Infiltration of the project database complete!

291
00:19:53,189 --> 00:19:53,770
What the...?!

292
00:19:54,135 --> 00:19:56,978
If it's online, I can access it. No problem.

293
00:19:57,915 --> 00:20:01,214
What can I say? I've learned a lot in the last year.

294
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:02,572
Nice job.

295
00:20:03,273 --> 00:20:04,027
Wow.

296
00:20:04,396 --> 00:20:07,045
Every lab in existence has to be on this thing.

297
00:20:07,361 --> 00:20:08,164
Jackpot!

298
00:20:08,231 --> 00:20:09,095
Uh-oh.

299
00:20:09,185 --> 00:20:10,711
I've combed through all the files,

300
00:20:10,773 --> 00:20:14,015
but I'm not seeing any trace of the information we need.

301
00:20:14,228 --> 00:20:17,501
I guess the higher-ups only hand off
that kinda stuff in person.

302
00:20:17,806 --> 00:20:18,342
Great.

303
00:20:18,368 --> 00:20:21,472
So is anybody even doing research
on how to save Koro-sensei?

304
00:20:21,497 --> 00:20:23,943
Guys, look. There's a lab in the U.S.

305
00:20:24,165 --> 00:20:29,458
"Preventing destructive antimatter chain reactions
due to tentacle-cell aging and fission."

306
00:20:29,655 --> 00:20:32,715
I'm no scientist, but that
seems like a definite hit to me!

307
00:20:32,937 --> 00:20:36,116
"Last samples return from ISS on January 25th."

308
00:20:36,273 --> 00:20:38,372
What is ISS? Anybody know?

309
00:20:38,805 --> 00:20:40,526
Wait a minute. That's...

310
00:20:41,064 --> 00:20:41,741
Whoa!

311
00:20:42,096 --> 00:20:44,005
The International Space Station!

312
00:20:44,453 --> 00:20:46,953
They're conducting their research in outer space!

313
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:48,939
Um, it's possible!

314
00:20:49,089 --> 00:20:53,118
Certain types of research require
zero gravity or a perfect vacuum.

315
00:20:53,231 --> 00:20:58,106
And, well, of course, if there's a chance it
could cause a big, uh, catastrophic explosion,

316
00:20:58,274 --> 00:21:00,339
there'd way be way less collateral damage.

317
00:21:00,736 --> 00:21:03,223
Couldn't we just ask for the data as colleagues?

318
00:21:03,248 --> 00:21:04,471
You could, sure.

319
00:21:04,772 --> 00:21:07,602
But sadly you kids are just one outpost among many.

320
00:21:08,498 --> 00:21:11,591
With all the red tape involved,
that data might not make it time.

321
00:21:15,686 --> 00:21:16,858
Mr. Karasuma.

322
00:21:17,112 --> 00:21:17,662
Uh?

323
00:21:18,523 --> 00:21:19,871
I know what you're thinking.

324
00:21:20,356 --> 00:21:22,230
Killing him is still the backup plan.

325
00:21:22,488 --> 00:21:25,485
Trust me. We're not going to go into this half-cocked.

326
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:29,140
If there's any hope of saving him at all,
we'll do whatever it takes.

327
00:21:29,273 --> 00:21:32,119
If not, this class will stick to the original game plan.

328
00:21:32,606 --> 00:21:34,010
Won't we, Nagisa?

329
00:21:34,356 --> 00:21:34,844
Mm.

330
00:21:35,558 --> 00:21:37,658
That's been our understanding from the start.

331
00:21:38,273 --> 00:21:40,660
Before we do anything, I need a blueprint.

332
00:21:41,023 --> 00:21:42,178
Be square with us.

333
00:21:42,276 --> 00:21:44,434
How serious are the rules we're about to break?

334
00:21:46,414 --> 00:21:49,099
Mr. Karasuma. Miss Irina.

335
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,673
Will you give the students and I a moment?

336
00:21:53,189 --> 00:21:57,703
What we're about to discuss might potentially
cause one or two liability issues for you.

337
00:21:59,773 --> 00:22:00,824
Okey dokey!

338
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:03,179
Here's essentially what you're trying to do.

339
00:22:03,262 --> 00:22:09,207
You need to grab a quick peek of the research data
in question before it reaches America from Outer Space.

340
00:22:09,523 --> 00:22:11,407
Yeah, but as for the how...

341
00:22:11,856 --> 00:22:13,448
How indeed!

342
00:22:13,773 --> 00:22:14,664
Huh?

343
00:22:15,055 --> 00:22:16,261
Lookie, lookie!

344
00:22:16,483 --> 00:22:20,066
Guess where this beautifully streamlined
bucket of bolts is about to be sent?

345
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:21,774
Is that a manned rocket?

346
00:22:22,081 --> 00:22:23,172
Precisely!

347
00:22:23,359 --> 00:22:26,534
A proof-of-concept craft developed right here in Japan.

348
00:22:26,837 --> 00:22:29,629
Test dummies have been given
the honor of taking the first trip.

349
00:22:29,759 --> 00:22:32,755
But what if they were replaced with actual people?

350
00:22:34,898 --> 00:22:35,648
You're serious...

351
00:22:36,579 --> 00:22:39,547
That's it. Our teacher's officially gone off the deep end.

352
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:40,271
Yes!

353
00:22:40,544 --> 00:22:44,546
Consider this the Assassination Classroom's
out-of-season research project!

354
00:22:45,095 --> 00:22:49,282
Ground control to Major Tom: The ISS has been hijacked!

355
00:22:49,903 --> 00:22:51,513
Whoa. No way.

356
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,182
Yes, way! All the way!
