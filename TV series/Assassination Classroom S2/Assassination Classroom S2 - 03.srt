1
00:00:00,905 --> 00:00:02,896
Now then, Koro-sensei.

2
00:00:03,410 --> 00:00:06,192
Let your final death match begin.

3
00:00:07,727 --> 00:00:10,926
So strong, but compared to me...

4
00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:12,775
so weak.

5
00:01:48,892 --> 00:01:49,957
It's Itona!

6
00:01:51,558 --> 00:01:53,766
I'm afraid drastic changes to the playing field

7
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:54,756
were in order.

8
00:01:55,322 --> 00:01:57,195
You understand, I'm sure.

9
00:01:58,714 --> 00:02:01,812
Ensnare first, strike second. Very effective.

10
00:02:02,392 --> 00:02:05,534
As you can see, we've taken a page from their tactics.

11
00:02:05,752 --> 00:02:06,830
You dirty...!

12
00:02:07,048 --> 00:02:09,185
I should've known it was you behind all this!

13
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,144
Indeed.

14
00:02:10,589 --> 00:02:14,451
When the trust of his students is
on the line, this creature panics.

15
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:17,685
If something seems a bit fishy, no matter,

16
00:02:18,228 --> 00:02:20,545
the fool plunges in headfirst.

17
00:02:20,775 --> 00:02:23,365
Ugh! Dammit! The bastard's stealing our kill!

18
00:02:23,451 --> 00:02:26,534
This totally counts as fighting
dirty, in case you didn't know!

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:29,705
Also commonly referred to as being an adult.

20
00:02:30,534 --> 00:02:32,922
Note the gloves on Itona's tentacles.

21
00:02:33,213 --> 00:02:36,745
The edges are sharp and
constructed of anti-Sensei material.

22
00:02:37,166 --> 00:02:42,155
Each defensive stroke by your teacher
results in ever increasing damage to his limbs.

23
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,055
Though that won't be quite enough to finish him off.

24
00:02:49,436 --> 00:02:51,522
I've won, big brother. Give up already.

25
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:52,966
This is just how it is.

26
00:02:53,593 --> 00:02:56,556
I have one problem to solve: You!

27
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,215
At last, I will prove my strength!

28
00:03:06,964 --> 00:03:09,319
Bravo! Well done, Itona!

29
00:03:09,477 --> 00:03:11,291
If we were in the First Term right now,

30
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:13,506
this might've actually cooked my goose!

31
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:15,464
One criticism, though.

32
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:17,739
Your attack pattern is rather transparent.

33
00:03:17,822 --> 00:03:20,030
However fast you are, however strong,

34
00:03:20,227 --> 00:03:22,447
however many schemes your guardian thinks up,

35
00:03:22,641 --> 00:03:25,579
however prone I am to panic, by our third bout,

36
00:03:25,804 --> 00:03:29,630
I can adapt to the idiosyncrasies
of your fighting style with ease.

37
00:03:30,235 --> 00:03:32,851
No way. It's not possible!

38
00:03:36,127 --> 00:03:37,291
Dear boy.

39
00:03:38,541 --> 00:03:40,464
I study too, you realize.

40
00:03:40,677 --> 00:03:43,021
How could I mold young minds if I didn't?

41
00:03:43,585 --> 00:03:46,445
A true teacher misses no opportunity to learn.

42
00:03:47,636 --> 00:03:51,505
Now then, let's get rid of this dangerous cage, shall we?

43
00:03:51,626 --> 00:03:57,255
Incidentally, trying out my Absolute Defense Form
over the summer break taught me a very valuable skill.

44
00:03:57,426 --> 00:04:00,429
How to release a burst of
energy by compressing not my body,

45
00:04:00,548 --> 00:04:02,780
but only the tips of my tentacles.

46
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:05,322
What?

47
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:08,420
Remember this, Itona.

48
00:04:08,882 --> 00:04:11,422
Assassination is education, I say.

49
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:13,434
And in an Assassination Classroom,

50
00:04:13,593 --> 00:04:16,056
the teacher grows stronger with every lesson!

51
00:04:21,732 --> 00:04:25,717
Why? Why can't I ever win?

52
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:29,458
I'm supposed to be stronger than this.

53
00:04:36,467 --> 00:04:38,699
Well there you have it, Shiro.

54
00:04:39,034 --> 00:04:42,472
I suggest you go quietly and leave him to E-Class.

55
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:43,665
Also...

56
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:48,100
I'd appreciate it if you'd spread the word
that I'm not, in fact, an underwear thief!

57
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:51,713
And tell people I'm a B-cup! Got it? B-cup!

58
00:05:01,588 --> 00:05:02,342
It hurts...

59
00:05:02,426 --> 00:05:03,215
Itona!

60
00:05:03,867 --> 00:05:04,999
It hurts!

61
00:05:05,419 --> 00:05:07,420
Feels like my head's gonna burst!

62
00:05:07,923 --> 00:05:09,892
That would be the agony of defeat.

63
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:12,339
His tentacles are gnawing away at his brain.

64
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,769
Hang in there, Itona!

65
00:05:14,143 --> 00:05:16,883
Seems losing to you a third time was quite the blow.

66
00:05:17,685 --> 00:05:21,729
Failing to carry out this little scheme
of mine is clearly more than he can bear.

67
00:05:22,102 --> 00:05:24,114
Huh? What does that mean?

68
00:05:24,318 --> 00:05:25,223
Itona.

69
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:27,180
If this is the best you're capable of,

70
00:05:27,251 --> 00:05:29,189
the Organization will stop paying.

71
00:05:30,858 --> 00:05:32,612
I feel for you, I really do.

72
00:05:33,005 --> 00:05:35,047
But I have to cut my losses at some point,

73
00:05:35,202 --> 00:05:37,348
focus my attention on your successor.

74
00:05:38,501 --> 00:05:40,525
This is goodbye, Itona. I'm sorry.

75
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:42,313
You're own your own from here.

76
00:05:43,266 --> 00:05:44,947
Uh. Hey! Where're you going?

77
00:05:45,134 --> 00:05:47,071
How can you call yourself his guardian?

78
00:05:47,144 --> 00:05:49,638
Asks the monster playing classroom.

79
00:05:50,213 --> 00:05:53,986
Why feign concern when all you can really do is destroy?

80
00:05:54,662 --> 00:05:56,048
Mark my words.

81
00:05:56,297 --> 00:05:58,408
I will not tolerate your existence.

82
00:05:58,755 --> 00:06:00,331
In the end, I'll kill you.

83
00:06:01,165 --> 00:06:04,446
No cost is too high, no sacrifice too great.

84
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:07,339
Come to think of it, actually.

85
00:06:07,451 --> 00:06:10,025
How do you suppose your dear students feel about that?

86
00:06:13,012 --> 00:06:13,898
Look out!

87
00:06:22,363 --> 00:06:23,494
What was wrong with him?

88
00:06:27,273 --> 00:06:28,607
Koro-sensei!

89
00:06:31,338 --> 00:06:32,930
Don't worry. I'm just pooped.

90
00:06:33,222 --> 00:06:35,011
Nothing a little rest won't fix.

91
00:06:38,834 --> 00:06:42,709
Your immune system sees the
tentacle grafts as foreign objects.

92
00:06:43,142 --> 00:06:46,507
An intensive adaptive regimen must be adhered to daily.

93
00:06:46,911 --> 00:06:50,305
Otherwise the body takes nightmarish defensive measures.

94
00:06:50,669 --> 00:06:52,823
Once maintenance is discontinued,

95
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:56,544
the tentacles begin to painfully
corrode the nervous system.

96
00:06:57,107 --> 00:07:00,245
The average person dies of madness in three days.

97
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,799
The first incident was here.

98
00:07:07,238 --> 00:07:10,947
Officials don't yet have any suspects in
this bizarre string of cellphone shop attacks,

99
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,546
but aren't ruling out terrorism.

100
00:07:13,161 --> 00:07:15,998
Businesses in the area have been told to be on high alert.

101
00:07:16,458 --> 00:07:17,750
This has to be him.

102
00:07:17,778 --> 00:07:19,393
No kidding. Who else would it be?

103
00:07:19,422 --> 00:07:21,401
Yeah, but why cellphone shops, though?

104
00:07:21,728 --> 00:07:23,436
We can't just let him run loose.

105
00:07:23,461 --> 00:07:25,963
The burden of reining the boy in now falls on me.

106
00:07:26,255 --> 00:07:28,561
I have to find Itona and protect him.

107
00:07:29,377 --> 00:07:31,825
I've seen guys like Shiro before.

108
00:07:32,653 --> 00:07:36,464
This is a game to him. People are pawns to be sacrificed.

109
00:07:37,005 --> 00:07:39,851
You can never really know what
someone like that'll do next.

110
00:07:40,701 --> 00:07:43,416
Yeah, I vote it'd be better
if we just leave the kid alone.

111
00:07:43,734 --> 00:07:44,427
Uh?

112
00:07:44,659 --> 00:07:46,686
No. I am his teacher.

113
00:07:48,737 --> 00:07:51,778
A teacher never turns his back
on a student, no matter what.

114
00:07:52,065 --> 00:07:54,732
When I took this job, that was my solemn vow.

115
00:07:54,898 --> 00:07:56,260
To never let go.

116
00:08:05,591 --> 00:08:07,826
There are no shortcuts, son. Believe me.

117
00:08:09,886 --> 00:08:11,504
So if you want to get stronger,

118
00:08:11,977 --> 00:08:14,260
it takes work, heart, and integrity.

119
00:08:15,093 --> 00:08:16,271
That's the only way.

120
00:08:18,127 --> 00:08:19,093
Yeah right.

121
00:08:34,244 --> 00:08:37,976
No more lip service. No more beating around the bush.

122
00:08:38,492 --> 00:08:41,258
The only thing you learn from losing is how to be a loser.

123
00:08:41,654 --> 00:08:42,615
I wanna win.

124
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:44,492
I wanna be strong.

125
00:08:45,224 --> 00:08:47,669
Your human side is finally starting to show.

126
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:49,721
That's a positive sign.

127
00:08:50,713 --> 00:08:51,532
Big brother.

128
00:08:51,942 --> 00:08:54,401
I prefer Koro-sensei, if you please.

129
00:08:54,637 --> 00:08:57,091
A much more appropriate name, I think.

130
00:08:57,195 --> 00:08:59,826
Promise not to go all nuclear on us, okay?

131
00:09:00,213 --> 00:09:02,380
We've been through a lotta crap tonight because of you.

132
00:09:02,405 --> 00:09:05,880
But if you come quietly we're and willing
to let it slide, so just, you know...

133
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:07,348
Shut your face.

134
00:09:07,661 --> 00:09:11,464
We fight. Come at me. Right now!

135
00:09:12,088 --> 00:09:14,130
We can battle if that's what you really want.

136
00:09:14,252 --> 00:09:16,211
There must be a vacant lot nearby.

137
00:09:16,303 --> 00:09:18,655
State Secret versus State Secret.

138
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:22,261
When the smoke clears, we can study ways to kill me.

139
00:09:22,685 --> 00:09:25,846
I've got all the fixin's for a study-buddy-barbeque!

140
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,477
He's a very persistent Octopus.

141
00:09:28,569 --> 00:09:30,391
Take my word for it. Once you're in his class,

142
00:09:30,479 --> 00:09:32,766
he'll go to Hell and back to make sure a lesson sticks.

143
00:09:34,256 --> 00:09:35,459
You bet I will!

144
00:09:35,484 --> 00:09:37,839
Put a student in front of me and I'm in my element.

145
00:09:37,966 --> 00:09:41,242
The instinct to teach them is
so powerful, I can't help it.

146
00:09:46,089 --> 00:09:46,964
What is this stuff?

147
00:09:46,989 --> 00:09:48,210
I can't see!

148
00:09:48,684 --> 00:09:52,229
Oh dear. This is anti-me powder!

149
00:09:52,549 --> 00:09:56,813
Casting my ward adrift was all
part of the plan, Koro-sensei.

150
00:09:58,388 --> 00:10:02,114
I was so preoccupied with the
boy's bloodlust, I didn't even notice!

151
00:10:02,363 --> 00:10:05,767
Come along, Itona. You've one last duty to fulfill.

152
00:10:07,276 --> 00:10:08,357
Don't you dare!

153
00:10:11,391 --> 00:10:14,491
Rescue him. You are his teacher.

154
00:10:21,268 --> 00:10:22,342
Koro-sensei.

155
00:10:23,296 --> 00:10:25,456
No one's hurt, are they? Everyone okay?

156
00:10:26,177 --> 00:10:27,719
Uh, sure, more or less.

157
00:10:27,755 --> 00:10:28,339
Good.

158
00:10:28,735 --> 00:10:30,810
I'll go after your classmate. Away!

159
00:10:32,526 --> 00:10:33,693
You noticed that, right?

160
00:10:33,807 --> 00:10:35,832
Protecting us slowed his response time.

161
00:10:36,005 --> 00:10:37,023
Oh no.

162
00:10:37,214 --> 00:10:38,565
Damn that Shiro.

163
00:10:39,123 --> 00:10:41,328
He sure as hell made us his pawns, all right.

164
00:10:53,923 --> 00:10:54,775
Itona!

165
00:10:57,669 --> 00:10:58,389
Blast!

166
00:10:58,432 --> 00:11:00,804
They're using pressure rays to slow me down!

167
00:11:01,463 --> 00:11:05,046
Not that I'm the least bit
surprised, but you really are a fool.

168
00:11:06,057 --> 00:11:07,341
Itona is mine.

169
00:11:10,946 --> 00:11:11,908
Remarkable.

170
00:11:12,297 --> 00:11:15,923
You grow exponentially weaker when
the target is anyone but yourself.

171
00:11:16,381 --> 00:11:17,836
Are you certain you won't go?

172
00:11:17,861 --> 00:11:19,947
I am his teacher!

173
00:11:20,088 --> 00:11:22,859
I... I'm weak.

174
00:11:24,128 --> 00:11:26,179
Why else would my partner abandon me?

175
00:11:31,672 --> 00:11:32,813
Good eyes.

176
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:36,738
They radiate an insatiable hunger for victory.

177
00:11:37,423 --> 00:11:41,385
Crucial for anyone hoping to
fully utilize the cells I've created.

178
00:11:43,637 --> 00:11:46,405
I can help you carve a path to dominance.

179
00:11:46,963 --> 00:11:49,743
Let us review some simple arithmetic, you and I.

180
00:11:50,401 --> 00:11:53,730
Your tenacity plus my cutting-edge tech

181
00:11:54,053 --> 00:11:56,591
equals the power to seize victory.

182
00:11:56,929 --> 00:12:01,387
Indeed, you can become the
most powerful creature on Earth.

183
00:12:01,486 --> 00:12:03,059
I wanted it so badly.

184
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,990
I could endure the agony of those cells.

185
00:12:07,119 --> 00:12:08,547
I was so dead-set on winning,

186
00:12:08,572 --> 00:12:10,655
I could throw myself into whatever it took.

187
00:12:10,853 --> 00:12:12,861
Except... I lost.

188
00:12:13,669 --> 00:12:15,710
I lost and now I'm being protected by the thing

189
00:12:15,803 --> 00:12:16,969
I was supposed to kill.

190
00:12:17,406 --> 00:12:20,975
How? How did I lose to a bunch of nobodies?

191
00:12:25,155 --> 00:12:25,854
What the...?

192
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,130
You guys really shoulda seen this comin'.

193
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,364
That crap might be anti-Octopus,
but it sure ain't anti-us.

194
00:12:37,732 --> 00:12:38,839
Hey, Terasaka,

195
00:12:38,890 --> 00:12:40,787
can you grab those lights up in the in tree?

196
00:12:40,820 --> 00:12:41,705
All over it.

197
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:43,497
Damn kids! Huh?

198
00:12:46,838 --> 00:12:48,853
You're doing this for me?

199
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:50,728
Don't read too much into it.

200
00:12:51,476 --> 00:12:54,130
This isn't about you, we're just pissed at your boss.

201
00:12:54,204 --> 00:12:56,038
And if Koro-sensei hadn't bolted,

202
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:57,989
we'd have left you behind in a heartbeat.

203
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,850
You hear that, dude? I love how she pretends not to care.

204
00:13:01,096 --> 00:13:03,209
The girl runs hot n' cold.

205
00:13:04,256 --> 00:13:06,618
Wouldn't look this way if I were you, Shiro.

206
00:13:08,614 --> 00:13:10,030
You need to pay attention.

207
00:13:10,137 --> 00:13:12,766
Stop shootin' and the net'll come right off at the base.

208
00:13:13,002 --> 00:13:15,634
Excellent timing. Nicely done, children.

209
00:13:16,112 --> 00:13:17,897
That stuff's melting his tentacles.

210
00:13:17,962 --> 00:13:19,587
It's okay, we'll get you out of there!

211
00:13:19,685 --> 00:13:21,100
Step down, Shiro.

212
00:13:21,619 --> 00:13:23,388
We're taking Itona with us.

213
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:26,273
You're a meticulous man, that much is apparent,

214
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,573
but once you involve my students,

215
00:13:28,598 --> 00:13:30,705
there's no telling what lengths I'll go to.

216
00:13:31,264 --> 00:13:34,305
The sooner you home in on the obvious, the better.

217
00:13:36,203 --> 00:13:39,708
A class taught by a monster swarmed with gnats.

218
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:41,701
How infinitely irritating.

219
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:47,152
Though, I begrudgingly grant you my
approach is in need of a radical overhaul.

220
00:13:49,822 --> 00:13:51,200
Keep the boy if you like.

221
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,567
He'll only live another two days or so.

222
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:56,292
You kids play nice, now, hmm?

223
00:13:58,881 --> 00:14:01,401
Hard work, heart, integrity.

224
00:14:01,953 --> 00:14:02,792
What a joke.

225
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:06,303
At the end of the day, it all
comes down to who's stronger.

226
00:14:09,371 --> 00:14:13,111
As long as the poor boy is gripped
by this pathological need to win,

227
00:14:13,399 --> 00:14:16,380
the tentacle cells will cling too tightly to be extracted.

228
00:14:16,558 --> 00:14:18,530
So, can't we just cut 'em off, or whatever?

229
00:14:18,752 --> 00:14:20,578
Not until he can break the fixation.

230
00:14:20,964 --> 00:14:23,339
Some dreadful thing brought him to this pass.

231
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,880
We must find out what.

232
00:14:25,051 --> 00:14:25,980
Okay.

233
00:14:26,297 --> 00:14:29,724
Easier said than done. I mean,
he's not just gonna spill his guts.

234
00:14:29,963 --> 00:14:31,582
I was thinking, actually.

235
00:14:32,483 --> 00:14:34,005
His little rampage.

236
00:14:34,338 --> 00:14:37,359
Aren't cellphone shops a weirdly specific target?

237
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:41,155
I had Ritsu do some digging to see if she
could come up with a possible connection,

238
00:14:41,239 --> 00:14:42,500
and guess what,

239
00:14:43,047 --> 00:14:46,749
one company's president had a son named Itona.

240
00:14:47,505 --> 00:14:48,654
A parts supplier.

241
00:14:48,697 --> 00:14:51,516
Pretty modest, but they used to
have business all over the world.

242
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,250
They declared bankruptcy a couple of years ago.

243
00:14:54,578 --> 00:14:58,480
The president and his wife skipped town
and left the son behind with relatives.

244
00:14:58,505 --> 00:15:01,519
Suddenly, we had a clearer picture of Itona.

245
00:15:02,005 --> 00:15:04,720
Why he was so bent on power at any cost.

246
00:15:05,369 --> 00:15:06,880
Heh. Lame.

247
00:15:07,141 --> 00:15:09,623
That's all it took to make this punk a delinquent?

248
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:14,071
Like we don't all have a bag o' rocks to carry.

249
00:15:14,611 --> 00:15:16,256
Kid needs some perspective.

250
00:15:18,791 --> 00:15:20,005
We'll handle things from here.

251
00:15:20,088 --> 00:15:22,297
Take him in, care for him, yadda yadda.

252
00:15:22,464 --> 00:15:24,368
If he dies, he dies. We tried.

253
00:15:27,284 --> 00:15:28,324
Look around you, son.

254
00:15:28,684 --> 00:15:30,922
We don't look like much next to the big boys,

255
00:15:31,017 --> 00:15:32,846
but if we work hard, stay strong,

256
00:15:32,917 --> 00:15:36,012
and let integrity be our guide, we
can give 'em a run for their money.

257
00:15:37,563 --> 00:15:39,639
Yeah, sure. Whatever you say.

258
00:15:41,297 --> 00:15:42,380
Don't leave!

259
00:15:42,464 --> 00:15:43,964
You're this company's nerve center.

260
00:15:43,989 --> 00:15:45,853
We can't function without you!

261
00:15:46,635 --> 00:15:48,275
Integrity is meaningless.

262
00:15:48,922 --> 00:15:52,185
Against superior force, it isn't worth a damn.

263
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:56,242
I'm sorry, Itona.

264
00:15:56,797 --> 00:15:58,650
I'm sending you to live with your uncle.

265
00:16:03,823 --> 00:16:05,546
Welcome back, Sleeping Beauty.

266
00:16:08,130 --> 00:16:10,880
We used the anti-Sensei netting to make a bandana.

267
00:16:11,066 --> 00:16:12,302
For our own protection.

268
00:16:12,568 --> 00:16:14,344
We need to keep those tentacles in check.

269
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:21,606
How come we're lettin' this jerk eat ramen?

270
00:16:21,631 --> 00:16:23,214
'Cause he's bound to be hungry.

271
00:16:23,418 --> 00:16:26,197
If we expect him to feel better, he's gotta eat properly.

272
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:29,850
What do you think? Totally disgusting, right?

273
00:16:30,263 --> 00:16:33,172
I keep tellin' my old man, but he won't change the recipe.

274
00:16:33,422 --> 00:16:35,770
I agree. It is disgusting.

275
00:16:35,978 --> 00:16:39,051
Ugh, MSG doesn't hid the fact the bones are stale.

276
00:16:39,548 --> 00:16:42,947
And somebody needs to tell your old
man this fishcake topping is out of style.

277
00:16:43,119 --> 00:16:45,710
This recipe you've got is four generations too old.

278
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:48,130
Crap! He really knows his stuff.

279
00:16:48,275 --> 00:16:49,045
What a joke.

280
00:16:49,648 --> 00:16:52,246
This dive'll go belly up the second a competitor moves in.

281
00:16:52,753 --> 00:16:54,146
Just like what happened to dad.

282
00:16:54,418 --> 00:16:55,965
That's what integrity gets you.

283
00:16:57,797 --> 00:17:00,047
Hey, c'mon, let's hit up my place next!

284
00:17:00,186 --> 00:17:02,005
What I got's the bomb! It's totally modern.

285
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:04,232
This fossil ain't even remotely in the same league.

286
00:17:04,294 --> 00:17:04,919
Dude!

287
00:17:09,548 --> 00:17:10,839
Pretty badass, huh?

288
00:17:10,922 --> 00:17:12,691
Really takes your mind off things.

289
00:17:13,130 --> 00:17:15,380
You know he doesn't have a license, right?

290
00:17:15,503 --> 00:17:17,393
Relax. His folks own the track.

291
00:17:17,745 --> 00:17:20,047
Tell me this isn't the most awesome thing ever.

292
00:17:20,103 --> 00:17:21,024
It's all right.

293
00:17:21,239 --> 00:17:23,680
Oh yeah? Check out my brake turn!

294
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:28,797
Idiot! The hell you doing?

295
00:17:28,930 --> 00:17:31,255
Help him! The shock's gonna set him off again!

296
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,964
Relax, man! That wasn't enough to hurt him.

297
00:17:34,054 --> 00:17:36,319
Way to fly by the seat of your pants, guys.

298
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,288
See? He's fine.

299
00:17:38,313 --> 00:17:40,139
Well, they're a couple of morons.

300
00:17:40,164 --> 00:17:41,475
What did we really expect?

301
00:17:41,500 --> 00:17:42,547
Hey, no worries.

302
00:17:42,572 --> 00:17:44,590
At least Hazama's got a brain in her head.

303
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,092
You wanna get back at Shiro, am I right?

304
00:17:47,894 --> 00:17:49,474
This novel oughta inspire you.

305
00:17:49,932 --> 00:17:53,557
Seven volumes, 25 hundred pages full of delicious revenge.

306
00:17:53,609 --> 00:17:54,943
Read and let your soul be nourished

307
00:17:55,037 --> 00:17:56,332
by the darkness within.

308
00:17:56,672 --> 00:18:00,273
Toward the end the hero learns to forgive,
so you don't have to bother reading that far.

309
00:18:00,298 --> 00:18:01,528
Seriously?

310
00:18:01,911 --> 00:18:03,047
No! Way too dark!

311
00:18:03,072 --> 00:18:05,031
And no one has the time to read a damn book!

312
00:18:05,056 --> 00:18:06,072
Oh, come on.

313
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:08,400
Evil has to be nurtured properly, too, you know.

314
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:10,148
We're supposed to be cheering him up!

315
00:18:10,173 --> 00:18:11,698
You gotta think of your audience!

316
00:18:11,810 --> 00:18:14,200
He's probably not the sharpest tool in the shed. Uh...

317
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:17,745
Uh, he's gettin' all twitchy again.

318
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,668
Hell, I'd be twitchy too if Terasaka called me stupid.

319
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:24,013
Oh no. It's the tentacles! He's about to flip out!

320
00:18:25,594 --> 00:18:27,832
I am not one of you losers!

321
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:31,439
I'm strong! I'm strong and I win!

322
00:18:34,172 --> 00:18:35,460
What're you doing?

323
00:18:35,588 --> 00:18:39,090
Take it easy. We all wanna kill the Octopus.

324
00:18:39,264 --> 00:18:42,133
Matter of fact, I was just
thinking about it earlier today.

325
00:18:42,513 --> 00:18:46,464
Look, you're not gonna get him right
outta the gate, so get over yourself.

326
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:48,610
You need this too bad, man.

327
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:51,047
Just let it go. You gotta chill the hell out.

328
00:18:51,302 --> 00:18:52,319
Ugh! Shut up!

329
00:18:54,797 --> 00:18:56,530
Hah. Second time today.

330
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,989
And you're weaker now, so it's way easier.

331
00:18:59,167 --> 00:19:02,154
Don't get me wrong, it still
hurts bad enough I wanna puke.

332
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:06,172
And speaking of puke, this
reminds me of Muramatsu's ramen.

333
00:19:06,197 --> 00:19:06,999
Hey!

334
00:19:07,089 --> 00:19:11,172
You see, the Octopus told him it'd be
a good idea for him to study business.

335
00:19:11,501 --> 00:19:13,459
Sure, his dad's ramen is crap,

336
00:19:13,504 --> 00:19:15,360
but one of these days, he'll take over.

337
00:19:16,047 --> 00:19:18,047
And with what he's learned he can push new flavors.

338
00:19:18,072 --> 00:19:19,443
The joint'll be hoppin'.

339
00:19:20,024 --> 00:19:22,597
The Octopus said the same thing to Yoshida.

340
00:19:22,775 --> 00:19:25,282
It's about bein' patient, pickin' your moment.

341
00:19:25,777 --> 00:19:27,245
So snap out of it.

342
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,843
You can't let a couple losses blow you off course!

343
00:19:31,105 --> 00:19:33,339
You don't have to win now, just someday!

344
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,614
Slow and steady wins the race, right?

345
00:19:35,801 --> 00:19:37,699
Well, it kills the Octopus, too.

346
00:19:38,305 --> 00:19:40,892
Doesn't matter if we screw up a hundred times either.

347
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:43,951
As long as we kill him once before March rolls around,

348
00:19:44,186 --> 00:19:44,921
we win.

349
00:19:45,439 --> 00:19:49,960
Use the reward money to get your dad's factory
runnin' again so him and your mom can come back.

350
00:19:50,227 --> 00:19:52,214
That's somethin' to shoot for. Why not?

351
00:19:52,937 --> 00:19:54,100
I can't handle this.

352
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:56,775
The hell am I supposed to do while I'm waiting to win?

353
00:19:57,016 --> 00:19:59,214
How... How do I pass the time?

354
00:19:59,294 --> 00:20:00,026
Huh?

355
00:20:00,447 --> 00:20:02,947
You act like an idiot, like we did tonight.

356
00:20:03,211 --> 00:20:05,674
Don't worry, we got you covered in that department.

357
00:20:07,582 --> 00:20:08,780
Isn't that heartwarming.

358
00:20:08,838 --> 00:20:11,297
And who but an idiot could've
said it with a straight face?

359
00:20:11,426 --> 00:20:14,024
I gotta say, sometimes the word of an idiot

360
00:20:14,355 --> 00:20:16,192
is exactly what you need to hear.

361
00:20:18,937 --> 00:20:21,358
So I was... being impatient?

362
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:22,995
Hah.

363
00:20:23,672 --> 00:20:24,965
A little bit, yeah.

364
00:20:25,133 --> 00:20:27,600
I do believe the fire in your eyes is out.

365
00:20:27,625 --> 00:20:28,571
In a good way.

366
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:32,297
Those painful tentacle cells can finally be excised now.

367
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:33,739
But don't fret too much.

368
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:35,130
What you'll lose in power,

369
00:20:35,262 --> 00:20:37,476
you'll more than make up for in friends.

370
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:41,242
You will come and kill me, won't you? Starting tomorrow?

371
00:20:42,892 --> 00:20:44,015
Whatever you say.

372
00:20:44,746 --> 00:20:46,280
I'm sick of this power anyway.

373
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,401
And this whole brother thing.

374
00:20:51,047 --> 00:20:52,420
Hey, look who's here.

375
00:20:52,588 --> 00:20:55,005
Bet it's nice not to have to bust through a wall, huh?

376
00:20:55,089 --> 00:20:58,156
Good morning! That bandana's lookin' pretty sharp!

377
00:20:58,367 --> 00:20:59,992
Well, hello there! Welcome!

378
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,530
How are we feeling today?

379
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:02,844
Not so hot.

380
00:21:03,282 --> 00:21:05,171
Sucks not having my power anymore.

381
00:21:05,709 --> 00:21:08,087
Still, guess I don't feel any weaker.

382
00:21:08,748 --> 00:21:11,647
I will kill you before it's all over, Koro-sensei.

383
00:21:12,668 --> 00:21:14,874
And that's how the textbook problem child

384
00:21:14,977 --> 00:21:17,489
Itona Horibe finally joined E-Class.

385
00:21:17,615 --> 00:21:19,720
Muramatsu, hey. I'm broke.

386
00:21:19,881 --> 00:21:22,214
Give me some of your ramen and I'll try not to puke.

387
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:22,921
Huh?

388
00:21:23,024 --> 00:21:24,947
By being part of Terasaka's group.
